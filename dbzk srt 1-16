3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,690
Kaboom! Kaboom! What luck

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,820
Kaboom! Kaboom! It's paradise

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,240
The Genki Dama is bursting through the air! Go go, let's do it

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:27,540
A suspicious, wriggling energy

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:33,010
I won't go easy on it -- just watch!

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:39,470
I'll protect you even if it kills me

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,310
Turn your power of love into strength

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,230
I'll overcome any problems with my perseverance and fighting spirit

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,660
Even tough guys make me really excited

12
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,950
Kaboom! Kaboom! What luck

13
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,120
Kaboom! Kaboom! Now's our chance

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,710
Ride the lucky wind -- zip, zip!

15
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,880
Kaboom! Kaboom! What luck

16
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,010
Kaboom! Kaboom! Even tomorrow

17
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,180
Your soul already knows the answer

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,650
Dragon Soul!

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,050
Kakarrot?!

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,290
That low level warrior's kid, right?

21
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,820
I guess all we can do is send him off to some remote planet.

22
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,210
I guess so.

23
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,490
On Planet Vegeta, a boy was wailing.

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,570
His mother and father's planet was probably about to be destroyed by an enemy.

25
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,530
Freeza!

26
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,720
Freeza!

27
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,910
It's Lord Freeza! Lord Freeza...!

28
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,460
Now everything will change!

29
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,940
Planet Vegeta's fate! And Kakarrot's!

30
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,890
And...

31
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,550
...yours, you bastard!

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,210
This is the end!

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,450
Wh-What?!

34
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,260
Ka... ka...

35
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,980
Ka... ka... rrot...!

36
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,930
KAKARROT!!

37
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,670
Kakarrot, my son...

38
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:55,010
Heed my will! You will destroy the enemy of Planet Vegeta!

39
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,010
And thus, a lone baby from a distant planet fell to Earth.

40
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,020
This was a boy who bore an unknown fate.

41
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,310
I'll call you... Goku!

42
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,950
This is the tale of Son Goku.

43
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:30,070
Son Goku grew up happy and healthy, and together with Bulma,

44
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:39,780
he went on a journey to find the seven Dragon Balls,
which when gathered will grant any wish.

45
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,080
Along the way, Goku met various foes,

46
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,310
learnt new techniques and fought in a quest to grow stronger.

47
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,130
and in the fight against a demonic power bent on ruling the world,

48
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,590
he went to the martial arts sage, Karin-sama, and gained even more strength.

49
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:15,440
Then he managed to crush the hopes of the Great Demon King Piccolo, who had made himself youthful with the Dragon Balls, once and for all.

50
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,560
But when Piccolo died, he secretly left something behind.

51
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:36,330
Three years later, a legendary battle unfolded between
Ma Junior -- the reincarnation of Piccolo -- and a much older Son Goku.

52
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,420
At the end of a deadly struggle, Goku finally emerged victorious.

53
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:51,130
Five years on, Goku had married Chichi rather suddenly,

54
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,160
and the people lived in peace.

55
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,300
However...

56
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:27,690
The Curtain Rises on the Battle!
Son Goku is Back

57
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,500
Gohan-chan!

58
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,450
It's time to eat!

59
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,890
Gohan-chan!

60
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,000
This'll do!

61
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
Gohan-chan!

62
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,160
Welcome back.

63
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,290
Goku-sa, do you know where Gohan is?

64
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,740
Food? I'm starving too!

65
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,250
What are you talking about? Have you seen Gohan-chan?

66
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,160
No, I haven't.

67
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,950
If you don't eat and get going soon,
Muten Roshi-sama and the others will be waiting forever.

68
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,950
Right, I'll go and look for him.

69
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,190
I doubt he's gone far.

70
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,470
OK. Leave it to me!

71
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,850
Thanks!

72
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
Aren't you pretty?

73
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,440
My name is Son Gohan.

74
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,770
Wait!

75
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,340
Mother! Father!

76
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,620
Gohan!

77
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,550
It's Father!

78
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,980
Wait there! I'll save you right now!

79
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,070
Gohan!

80
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,380
Just a little further...

81
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,790
Father!

82
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,320
Gohan!

83
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,330
Father!

84
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,070
Gohan!

85
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,840
Gohan!

86
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,150
Father! Please help me!

87
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,100
I'm scared! I'm scared, Father!

88
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,920
Father! I was so scared! I was so scared, Father!

89
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,220
Gohan, I'm impressed.

90
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,260
How did you get up here?

91
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,720
I don't know.

92
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,060
Gohan, let's go home. Your mother's worried about you!

93
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,470
And we have to go and see the old Turtle Hermit soon.

94
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,410
Yeah!

95
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,650
Heave-ho...

96
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,510
Just one more load.

97
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,960
Wh-What was that?

98
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,460
A meteor? A UFO?!

99
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,850
Th-That's no meteor.

100
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,570
What on earth is it?

101
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,100
Who... Who the hell are you?

102
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,060
His battle power is only 5. Worthless trash.

103
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,060
D-Don't come any closer!

104
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,050
I'll shoot!

105
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,410
What fragile people.

106
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,230
There's someone here with great power.

107
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,390
Distance is 4880.

108
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,680
Kakarrot?

109
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,060
Wh... What is this power?

110
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,640
Could it be... Son Goku?

111
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,330
Why that...!

112
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,450
No! It's not!

113
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,770
You're not Kakarrot.

114
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,490
Who the hell are you?

115
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,490
Do you have some business with me?

116
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,790
I have no business with the likes of you.

117
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,940
Why did you come here then? Do you want to die?

118
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,420
You're very high and mighty.

119
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,720
Battle power 322. So there are people like this here.

120
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:34,770
Regardless...

121
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,460
You are not my enemy.

122
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,280
What?! Do you have any idea who you're talking to?

123
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,280
No idea.

124
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,440
How can he be so powerful?

125
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,760
What a pointless technique.

126
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,650
Does it just make dust fly everywhere?

127
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,940
Is it my turn now?

128
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,520
In that case I'll give you just a taste of my abilities.

129
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,240
Another great power.

130
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,890
It's that way. Distance is 12909.

131
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,340
It's huge.

132
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,560
The strongest power on this planet.

133
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,920
This time it must be Kakarrot!

134
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,000
Im... Impossible...!

135
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,260
I was trembling so hard I couldn't move!

136
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,050
Hello!

137
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,360
It's been a while.

138
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,420
Bulma-san!

139
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,410
You said to come over, so here I am.

140
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,960
It really has been a long time.

141
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,430
This place never changes, does it?

142
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,850
Don't be so cold. I made it like this because you were coming over.

143
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,710
Here.

144
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,330
I brought some manju for you.

145
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,100
You didn't have to make such a fuss.

146
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,980
I'd be happy with just touching your boobies a little bit.

147
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,400
I see you're still the serious one in these comedy sketches.

148
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,610
I see you're still a pervert.

149
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,600
By the way Bulma-san, where's Yamcha-san?

150
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,360
Yamcha? That idiot.

151
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,580
How should I know where he is?

152
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,100
I was so angry, I forgot to tell him everyone was coming here today!

153
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,610
But let's forget about that and have some fun!

154
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,610
Those two are fighting?

155
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,900
Seems so.

156
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,220
By the way, where's Lunch-san?

157
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,580
Five years ago she chased after Tenshinhan-san and went somewhere.

158
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,310
The location of that power is moving at quite a pace.

159
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,640
Look! There's Muten Roshi-sama's place!

160
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,340
Hey!

161
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,440
It's...

162
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,120
- Son-kun!
- Goku!

163
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:53,980
Yo.

164
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,220
Hey, who's the kid?

165
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,540
Did you start working part-time as a babysitter?

166
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,820
He's my son.

167
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,870
Goku's?!

168
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,630
That's right. Is something wrong?

169
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,000
Go on, introduced yourself.

170
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,250
Hello.

171
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,780
Oh, hello.

172
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,720
Hello.

173
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,720
He's called Son Gohan.

174
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,390
Son Gohan.

175
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,060
Oh, I see. You named him after your dead grandfather.

176
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,030
Yup.

177
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,570
But he was certainly a surprise.

178
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,040
I never thought you would bring a son with you.

179
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,840
Gohan-kun, how old are you?

180
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,090
I am four years old.

181
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,080
I wouldn't have expected Son-kun's son to be so polite.

182
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,360
That Chichi will never shut up.

183
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,230
Hey, Gohan-kun... What do you want to be when you grow up?

184
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,100
A great scholar.

185
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,130
A... A scholar?

186
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,100
A tail.

187
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,370
Yeah.

188
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,570
Like I used to have.

189
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,220
You're right!

190
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,840
Um, this kid... There's nothing str-strange about him, is there?

191
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,560
Strange?

192
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,570
F-For example, nothing odd happens at night when there's a full moon, does it?

193
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,210
When there's a full moon?

194
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,650
I dunno. We always go to bed early.

195
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,190
Why?

196
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,410
Oh, nothing. In that case it's fine.

197
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,820
S-Say, Goku... Is he strong like you?

198
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,810
The thing is...

199
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,170
I think he's got a lot of strength in him,

200
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,690
but whenever I say I want to train him, Chichi gets annoyed.

201
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,690
Rock, paper, scissors!

202
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,850
Why? Isn't that a waste?

203
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,910
Right? She says we don't need martial arts anymore because the world is at peace.

204
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,860
She says now it's the age of studying.

205
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,450
So that tomboy has become quite the pushy mother.

206
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,450
Father!

207
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,730
Tell me, is that a Dragon Ball on Gohan-kun's hat?

208
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,900
Yeah. The four-star ball.

209
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,700
It's a memento of my grandpa.

210
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,980
I searched for it and put it on there.

211
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,960
Along the way I found the three-star and five-star balls. Those are at home.

212
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,190
The Dragon Balls, huh? That takes me back.

213
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,570
- What?
- What's that?

214
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,520
S... Something's headed this way.

215
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,470
There's something coming?

216
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,220
Incredible power... I feel incredible power! What could it be?

217
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,650
It's here!

218
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,650
It's arrived!

219
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,770
Wh-What is that?

220
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,810
Who is it?

221
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,550
What is this tremendous thirst for blood?

222
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,970
We meet at last.

223
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,640
You've certainly grown.

224
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,240
But I recognise you at first glance, Kakarrot.

225
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,070
Kakarrot?

226
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,660
You look just like your father.

227
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,460
What's this about?

228
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,260
What? What he's talking about?

229
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,660
Kakarrot! Why is this planet in such a state?

230
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,660
Your mission was to wipe out humanity!

231
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,280
What have you been playing at?!

232
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,070
Now now, come on, you.

233
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,620
I don't know you are or where you're from, but go back there.

234
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,620
Shoo! Shoo!

235
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,100
You shouldn't drink so much before noon, you know.

236
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,530
- Come on, get out of here.
- Kuririn! Don't go near him!

237
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,510
Kuririn!

238
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,420
You bastard!

239
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,530
What's this? A man with a tail has appeared.

240
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,560
What is the horrible truth of his identity?

241
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,360
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! Give it your all in desperation

242
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,950
Fly to the infinite sky

243
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,950
Riding on a jet air current

244
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,700
You can go anywhere instantly

245
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,580
Being reckless is the best

246
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,830
Let's go tip-top! All right?

247
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,300
The Earth is so blue that it's dazzling

248
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:12,260
And we'll never surrender our irreplaceable planet

249
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,310
Burst through the air, Kamehameha!

250
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,310
I was born in these dangerous times...

251
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:25,280
...to protect the world

252
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,070
Yeah! Break! Care! Give it your all in desperation

253
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,450
Do it! Full power

254
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,450
My weapon is hope

255
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,120
So believe in the future

256
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,240
Hey, this is Goku!

257
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,340
You have a tail just like mine. Who the hell are you?

258
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,860
Remember, Kakarrot! Your mission, and the pride of the Saiyans!

259
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,810
Father, save me!

260
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:56,290
If you want your son to live, obey the orders of me, your brother!

261
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,600

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,350
It couldn't be Piccolo, could it?

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,900
I fought Piccolo five years ago in the Tenkaichi Budokai tournament, and...

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,710
Somehow I won.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,120
Has he spent the past five years training, and come back to defeat me again?

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,210
No, it's not him! Who the hell is it?

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,340
This man appeared out of nowhere.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,640

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,170
It seems you have finally realised who I am.

30
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,510
Who you are?

31
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,890
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,390
Come over here.

33
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,540
Kakarrot.

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,060
Have you forgotten even that?

35
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,330
I don't have a weird name like Kaka-whatever.

36
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,850
I am Son Goku!

37
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,110
What the...?

38
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,650
Go back!

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,630
Hey...

40
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,200
Have you ever experienced any severe head trauma?

41
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,860
What?

42
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,460
Did you hit your head really hard as a child?

43
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,710
Answer the damn question!

44
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:20,790
I did.

45
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,170
I don't remember it, but I hit my head when I was very little.

46
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,630
I thought so.

47
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,260
But what does that have to do with anything?

48
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,180
Goku.

49
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,600
Long ago, your grandfather, Son Gohan, told me something.

50
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,700
One day, he saw something in a deep chasm that seemed to have fallen from the sky.

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,950
When he looked more closely, there was a baby with a tail inside a round capsule.

52
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,750
He took the baby home and tried to raise it himself.

53
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,360
But no matter what he did, the baby had a bad temper and would never calm down.

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,730
He was utterly perplexed.

55
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,600
But one day, the baby accidentally fell off a cliff,

56
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,550
hit his head really hard and almost died.

57
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,020
But it seems that boy was saved by an unbelievable life force.

58
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,880
As a bonus, after that his bad behaviour disappeared,

59
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,370
and he became a good little boy.

60
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,060
That was me?

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,580
What does it mean?

62
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,370
Is there some kind of relationship between him and Son-kun?

63
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,250
Who the hell are you?

64
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,910
Tell me!

65
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,750
I shall.

66
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,660
You are not a human of this planet.

67
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,390
You were born on Planet Vegeta.

68
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,180
You belong to a clan of proud and strong warriors, the best in all of space...

69
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,220
The Saiyans.

70
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,050
Space...

71
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,850
...warriors?

72
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,680
The Saiyans?!

73
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,090
And I am your older brother...

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
Raditz!

75
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,080
G-Goku's o-older brother!?

76
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,360
B-Brothers?

77
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,020
No way!

78
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,150
Don't talk crap!

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,700
Yeah! If Goku's an alien, why is he here on Earth?

80
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,580
The answer is simple.

81
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:26,210
Kakarrot, you were sent here to wipe out all the pesky humans.

82
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,470
What?!

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,140
We Saiyans are a proud warrior clan.

84
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,340
We earn a living by travelling through space searching for planets with good environments,

85
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,290
destroying all the people who live there,

86
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,670
and then selling them at a high price to other aliens looking for a suitable planet.

87
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,030
If a planets has people with high battle power, adult warriors travel there.

88
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,660
For a low-level planet like this one, we send a baby, like you.

89
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:09,770
Given a few years, even you alone should have been able to wipe out the pesky inhabitants without much trouble.

90
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,970
If you had remembered your orders, at least.

91
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,010
It's fortunate that this planet has a moon.

92
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,810
Why is that fortunate?

93
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,880
Don't play dumb!

94
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,820
You must know that we Saiyans can only show our true potential when there's a full moon!

95
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,620
What do you mean? I have no idea what you're talking about!

96
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,470
What?

97
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,170
It can't be... Your tail...!

98
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,960
Where's your tail?!

99
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,290
It was cut off a long time ago.

100
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,840
I can't believe this.

101
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,800
You idiot!

102
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,300
No wonder you managed to get along with the people on this planet.

103
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,110
I've had it!

104
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,810
Maybe I did come here from some other planet,

105
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,420
and maybe you are my brother, but who cares?

106
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,110
Anyone who wants to wipe out humanity is the lowest of the low!

107
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,680
I'm Son Goku, and I was raised here.

108
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,320
Go back where you came from!

109
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,830
Yeah!

110
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:30,330
That's right! Whatever his past, today Son Goku is the finest Earthling there is!

111
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,050
Goku has even saved this world!

112
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,050
Go! Go home!

113
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,590
Actually, that's impossible.

114
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,800
The Saiyans were a minority race to begin with,

115
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,310
and then Planet Vegeta was hit by a huge meteor and exploded.

116
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,290
Nearly all of the Saiyans disappeared like space dust.

117
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,570
Including our mother and father.

118
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,400
Counting you, there are only four Saiyans left.

119
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,600
Me and one other were saved because we were attacking another planet.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,360
The other was fortunate enough to have been sent to a planet like you.

121
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,270
We just found a planet that looks like it'll sell for an exceptionally high price.

122
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,070
We want to attack it, but it's likely to be be a close fight with just the three of us.

123
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,570
That's when I remembered you, Kakarrot.

124
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,340
Your fighting ability might not be perfect yet,

125
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,580
but if you joined forces with the rest of us, we'd manage somehow.

126
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:49,830
Stay back!

127
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,870
Wake up, Kakarrot!

128
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,280
It'll be fun!

129
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,630
I'm scared!

130
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,670
Don't talk crap!

131
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,550
I'd rather die than help you!

132
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,550
I see.

133
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,560
I was curious right from the start,

134
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,070
but isn't that your son behind you?

135
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,220
No, it's not!

136
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,030
There's no use trying to lie.

137
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,370
Why else would he have a tail?

138
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,200
That's proof that he has the blood of a Saiyan, isn't it?

139
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,020
So what?!

140
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,100
You, the father, are being rather disobedient.

141
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,960
Maybe I should borrow your son for a while.

142
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,540
Don't come any closer!

143
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,270
If you come on step closer, I'll beat the hell out of you!

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,510
Father!

145
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,460
- Father!
- Done it!

146
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,810
Kakarrot, I'm taking the boy.

147
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,040
If you want him back alive, heed your brother's command.

148
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,550
D... D... Dammit!

149
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,550
Kakarrot, I will give you one day to think about it.

150
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,140
Okay? Although joining us seems to be your only choice.

151
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,180
However!

152
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,900
You'll have to show me some proof.

153
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,050
It's nothing complicated.

154
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:49,660
By this time tomorrow, kill just 100 of this planet's humans
and pile their corpses here.

155
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,880
You've heard me, correct?

156
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,890
I'll be looking forward to tomorrow.

157
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,010
I don't want to kill my little brother's son if I don't have to.

158
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,300
I'm scared! Father!

159
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,770
Go... Gohan!

160
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,420
Okay? I'll explain one more time.

161
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:47,000
By tomorrow, kill 100 humans of this planet and pile the corpses here.

162
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,980
If you do, I will let you join our group.

163
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,570
Naturally, if the corpses aren't here, your son will die.

164
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,380
You coward! Using a child like that!

165
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,870
Th-That's right!

166
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,530
That's right! And there's no way Goku would ever kill people!

167
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,330
That's fine.

168
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,090
If he doesn't mind this kid dying, there's no need for the 100 corpses.

169
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:27,780
However, one way or another, the people of this planet will be destroyed before too long.

170
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,290
After we're finished with our current planet, our next target is...

171
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,760
...this planet.

172
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,960
Wh-What was that?!

173
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:46,280
Together, we three Saiyans could probably wipe out the people on this planet in the space of a month.

174
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,620
Father!

175
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,620
Do you get it, Kakarrot?

176
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,710
No matter how much you struggle, your only choice is to join forces with us.

177
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,690
Give me back my son!

178
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,850
I'm expecting a good answer.

179
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,170
For your sake as well.

180
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,530
Don't even think of disobeying.

181
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:26,760
With your undeveloped battle power, you're no match for me.

182
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,280
Father!

183
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,670
See you later!

184
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,420
I'll be looking forward to tomorrow.

185
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,240
Gohan!

186
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,320
Father!

187
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,710
Gohan!

188
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,950
Are you all right, Son-kun?

189
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm so sorry.

190
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,470
We couldn't do a single thing to help.

191
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,740
Goku...

192
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,190
Kinto'un!

193
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,170
Wait! Don't do anything rash!

194
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,930
There's no use! You'll be killed!

195
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,390
Yeah.

196
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,270
Dammit! What should I do?

197
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,910
Think for a bit.

198
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,640
Hang in there.

199
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,060
It must be quite a shock.

200
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,170
You finally meet a blood relative, and it turns out to be someone like that.

201
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,210
Your older brother certainly is strong.

202
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,590
It's his tail.

203
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:39,840
If... If I grab his tail really strongly, he should get weaker.

204
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,160
That's how it was with me.

205
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,660
B-But still...

206
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,440
Do you really think you can grab his tail?

207
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,060
It's impossible for you people.

208
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,390
Piccolo!

209
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,320
You should realise by now how extraordinary his strength is.

210
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,650
He's not an opponent that your or I could contend with in a fair fight.

211
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,890
However...

212
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,430
If you and I join forces, there is a small chance of beating him.

213
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,030
What's made you so friendly all of a sudden?

214
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,270
Don't misunderstand me.

215
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,300
I'm not after peace or anything.

216
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,170
And I couldn't care less about your son.

217
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,070
He's just in the way of my plans for world domination.

218
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,570
First I will team up with you and deal with this guy and his two comrades.

219
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,380
Naturally, after that I will finally crush you.

220
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,890
I will have the world in my grasp.

221
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,000
I won't let you do that.

222
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,350
I won't let you do that, but...

223
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,350
The part where we team up is a good idea.

224
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,850
There seems to be no other choice.

225
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,950
That's right.

226
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,070
We'll have to grin and bear it.

227
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,200
Teaming up with you makes me want to throw up as well, you know.

228
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,580
Bulma, lend me the Dragon Radar.

229
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,450
Sure.

230
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,140
Can you keep up with the speed of the Kinto'un?

231
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,920
Don't insult me!

232
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,140
My method of flying isn't nearly as pathetic as yours.

233
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,640
Let me out!

234
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,820
Let me out! Let me out!

235
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,230
Now then...

236
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,610
How odd. A warning signal.

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,280
Battle power 710?

238
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
It's close.

239
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,720
What?!

240
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,390
Dammit. A malfunction?

241
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,100
It almost had me worried.

242
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,410
We should go down and approach him soon.

243
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,050
There's no point. We should keep going like this.

244
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,150
He's using some device.

245
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,790
It seems to show him the location of a target, and even its strength, as if it was right next to him.

246
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,690
So he knows we're coming?

247
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,500
Of course he does.

248
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,650
I see.

249
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,460
That means there's no chance of sneaking up on him.

250
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,630
It's happening again!

251
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,040
Battle power 710.

252
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,860
It must be malfunctioning after all.

253
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,050
Two readings!

254
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,950
They're coming this way!

255
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,030
One... two...

256
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
Their battle power readings are 322 and 334.

257
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,930
One of them has the same battle power as Kakarrot.

258
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,260
However...

259
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,440
He shouldn't be coming here.

260
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,540
He should be well aware that he has zero hope of winning.

261
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,360
And besides, he shouldn't know where I am.

262
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,650
I give up. It's completely broken.

263
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,980
It can't be!

264
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,810
He is here!

265
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,410
How did you find me?

266
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,960
As if I'd tell you.

267
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,120
Very well.

268
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,220
I'll ask a different question then.

269
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,540
Why the hell did you come here?

270
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,780
Why else? I came to get my son back!

271
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:43,060
So even though you're a Saiyan too, you don't want to join us?

272
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,170
I told you that already!

273
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,160
You intend to defy your older brother?

274
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,450
I don't have any brother.

275
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,510
Kakarrot...

276
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,930
I thought you'd be a little smarter than that.

277
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,190
The time for chitchat is over.

278
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,510
His battle power went up to 408.

279
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,890
So you've been training hard too.

280
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,310
Maybe now I'll be able to fight a little better.

281
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,460
Kakarrot went up to 416.

282
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,480
Imbeciles! You think you're strong now?

283
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,120
What?

284
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,840
Don't make me laugh.

285
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,870
People of your level just walking in blindly...

286
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,810
You need to learn your place.

287
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,560
There's more to a fight than pure strength!

288
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,230
We have a plan!

289
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,250
Don't bother trying to bluff.

290
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,740
Kakarrot, I have already given up on making you one of us.

291
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,460
It seems you'll only ever be a burden.

292
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,070
You are the shame of our clan!

293
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,440
Die!

294
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,970
Hey, you two... Before you die I'll tell you something interesting.

295
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:31,630
The other two living Saiyans are even more powerful than me.

296
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,270
An unprecedented fear.

297
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,550
Even if they defeat Raditz, there are stronger warriors to face?

298
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,010
Goku and Piccolo are at their wits' end!

Damn! Raditz is just too strong!

316
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,950
We can barely even touch him!

317
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,590
Son Goku! I'll show you the new technique I've been saving!

318
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,470
If it doesn't work, we probably have no way of beating him!

319
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,440
Here goes! It's all or nothing! We have to work together!

The might of his Saiyan brother, Raditz, left Goku at his wits' end.

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,240
- Father!
- Done it!

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,270
Kakarrot, I'm taking the boy.

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,320
If you want him back alive, heed your brother's command.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,500
Will he be able to get Gohan back?

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,590
Kaboom! Kaboom! What luck

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,720
Kaboom! Kaboom! It's paradise

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,910
I won't go easy on it -- just watch!

13
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:04,370
I'll protect you even if it kills me

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,210
Turn your loving courage into strength

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,130
I'll overcome any problems with my perseverance and fighting spirit

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,560
The tougher my foes are, the more fired up I get

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,850
Kaboom! Kaboom! What luck

18
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,020
Kaboom! Kaboom! Now's our chance

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,610
Ride the lucky wind -- zip, zip!

20
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,780
Kaboom! Kaboom! What luck

21
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,910
Kaboom! Kaboom! Even tomorrow

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:50,080

A Battle to the Death!
Goku and Piccolo's Fierce Attack That Risks It All

25
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,860
Even if you finally realise the how fearsome the Saiyans are, it's too late now!

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,540
For fools who ignore my warnings and fight back, all that remains is death!

27
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,710
What a pain. There are guys even stronger than you?

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,880
But doesn't that make you buzz with excitement, Son Goku?

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,610
Sorry. This time I'm not buzzing with excitement.

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,340
I'm shaking with fear.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,100
Obviously. But soon even that fear will turn into despair.

32
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,200
More importantly, where's my son?!

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,300
Where have you hidden him?!

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,000
I haven't hidden him.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,190
I just shut him away because all his crying got on my nerves.

36
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,380
There should be a hole behind you. He's in there.

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,630
So that's where he is.

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,590
Gohan...

39
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,630
Father! Save me! Father!

40
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,450
Just wait there, Gohan!

41
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,460
Your dad's gonna save you right away!

42
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,710
Don't talk nonsense.

43
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,720
There's no way you can save him.

44
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,220
You'll die before that.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,320
Right! Here goes!

46
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,240
There's no other option!

47
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,720
Behind me!

48
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,030
Crap!

49
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,830
Wh-Where did he go?

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,710
Right here.

51
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,150
D... Dammit!

52
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,390
Are you all right, Piccolo?

53
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,820
Don't worry. E-Even with an arm missing, I'll fight somehow.

54
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,460
It seems your death is getting closer and closer!

55
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,530
Dammit!

56
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,880
Hey, Son Goku... You haven't got any special techniques you've been saving, have you?

57
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,250
I'm afraid not.

58
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,740
Why don't you just come out and say it?

59
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,710
You slacker.

60
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,300
And there was me training so hard that I developed something new!

61
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,370
What are you chattering about?

62
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,930
Whatever plan you try, it's useless!

63
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,100
It would be easier if you just gave up and kicked the bucket.

64
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,060
Can you do it with one arm?

65
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,010
Yeah, that's fine.

66
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,270
But this technique needs a lot of time for me to charge up Ki.

67
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,740
While I do that, you'll have to fight him alone and draw his attention.

68
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,790
Got it.

69
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,540
I'd been saving this to kill you with.

70
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,580
And now you're saving me with it instead.

71
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,170
If we manage to defeat this guy, you're next!

72
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,520
I'm looking forward to it.

73
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,340
Anyway, let's see if I can hold him off!

74
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,000
Persistent bastard!

75
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,640
Ka... me...

76
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,220
His battle power is going up!

77
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,050
Ha... me...

78
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,440
Th... This one's battle power is 1020!

79
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,460
Unbelievable. It's still increasing!

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,370
Ha!

81
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,450
Don't get cocky!

82
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,270
He took it head-on!

83
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,430
Now here's a present for you.

84
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,030
Die!

85
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,160
Battle power 1330?!

86
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,880
He's collecting all of his battle power in his fingertips.

87
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,320
Damn! These guys can manipulate their power at will!

88
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,300
Take this!

89
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,680
Makankosappo!
(Demonic Penetrating Ray Death Cannon)

90
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,830
He... He dodged it!

91
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,880
You bastard! I won't forgive you for making a mark on my body!

92
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,650
Roll over and die!

93
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,320
How careless of you.

94
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,280
I've got your tail!

95
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,650
Damn! When did you...!

96
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,460
Piccolo, now! Use that one again!

97
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,460
You did it, Goku!

98
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,270
Don't let go of his tail!

99
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,180
I've can only use this technique one more time!

100
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,800
K-Kakarrot! Are you planning to kill your only brother?

101
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,960
Shut up! I told you, a horrible person like you is no brother of mine!

102
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
And you tried to kill me, so don't say stuff like that.

103
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,500
I've given up now.

104
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,500
I've had a change of heart.

105
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,360
I'll leave this planet without a fuss!

106
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,510
Don't be fooled, Son Goku!

107
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,580
He's just spouting hot air!

108
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,230
He would never do something like that!

109
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,590
Please believe me, little brother!

110
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,750
It's true, I've done horrible things up till now... Even to you!

111
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,550
But... I'll definitely keep this promise!

112
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,100
R-Really?

113
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,890
Really!

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,070
You mustn't! Don't let of his tail!

115
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,650
This is his plan!

116
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,720
I'm begging you, Kakarrot!

117
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,180
Please believe me!

118
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,080
Son Goku!

119
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,930
You imbecile!

120
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,370
It's rare to find someone as stupid as you!

121
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,320
Th-That was dirty!

122
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,150
But I'm different. I'm a first-class warrior.

123
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,600
Even if you are my brother, I'll kill you without hesitation!

124
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,760
Shall I give you a taste?

125
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,270
Here!

126
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,620
Come on, come on! Suffer more! You'll be dead soon!

127
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,840
What's wrong? Go on, try doing the same attack as before.

128
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,980
If I do it now he'll just dodge it again.

129
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,900
What!?

130
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,700
Wha... What!?

131
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,140
Impossible!

132
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,630
Gohan!

133
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,800
R... Run, Gohan!

134
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,240
Run!

135
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,190
Battle power... 1307!?

136
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:37,860
Don't pick on my father!

137
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,830
Go... Gohan...

138
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Father!

139
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,420
You...

140
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,130
Father!

141
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,090
Y-You brat!

142
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,720
Run!

143
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,640
Gohan, run away!

144
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,080
Run! Quick!

145
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,360
Now his battle power is only 1!

146
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,530
It can change completely based on his emotions!

147
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,730
Run!!

148
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,950
Gohan!!

149
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,210
Gohan!

150
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,630
Stop! Please, stop!

151
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,310
He's...

152
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,800
He's still just a kid? Is that what you're trying to say?

153
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,300
Don't make me laugh. This brat's battle power is far higher than either of yours.

154
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,050
I'll kill him now while he doesn't know how to use his power properly.

155
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,860
Don't worry. I'll let you see him again soon.

156
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,780
In the afterlife.

157
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,200
Wait!

158
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:27,100
You're the first one who has ever caused me this much damage.

159
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,200
But it ends here!

160
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,680
Die!

161
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,690
Damn you!

162
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,160
Piccolo, quick! Use that technique again!

163
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,530
I thought I'd need to, so I've been getting ready!

164
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,480
But it'll still take a little longer!

165
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,610
Piccolo, hurry up!

166
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,840
Please, hurry up and do it!

167
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,190
Let go of me, Kakarrot!

168
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,660
You idiot! If you're this close to me, he'll hit you too!

169
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,990
I guess I'll die along with you!

170
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,230
Wh-What?!

171
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,140
You can't be serious!

172
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,410
This is the only way to defeat you!

173
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,020
Son Goku!

174
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,140
I'm not going to hold back!

175
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,320
Killing you along with him...
It's the best possible outcome for me!

176
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,020
Let me go! I'm sorry!

177
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,030
I'll never come to this planet again!

178
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,010
You think you can fool me again?

179
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,720
I'm not lying! Don't you believe your own brother?

180
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,720
Piccolo! Hurry up and do it!

181
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,050
Sorry to keep you waiting.

182
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,510
Are you ready?

183
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,400
Do it!

184
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,900
Take this!

185
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,100
Wait!

186
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,780
Makankosappo!

187
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,800
Goddammit!

188
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:08,250
Dammit! Someone like me... was killed... by people like these?

189
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:19,340
I can't believe... Kakarrot would even... throw away his own life.

190
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,530
Son Goku will be able to come back to life soon.

191
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,350
What?!

192
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,290
We have something good on this planet called the Dragon Balls.

193
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,310
If you ask them, any wish becomes possible.

194
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,830
Even bringing the dead back to life.

195
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,030
You bastards.

196
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,550
But... I got to hear something very interesting.

197
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:58,300
Everything that's happened up till now has been transmitted to my two comrades, far off in space.

198
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,080
What?

199
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,430
They know that I've been killed, and they...

200
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,920
They're definitely on their way here!

201
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:21,720
I-In an instant they can completely wipe out
not just you, but all the people on this planet.

202
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:28,020
When will those two get here?

203
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,280
One year. In just one year.

204
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,860
In one year... two of them... who are even stronger...

205
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,570
Your happiness was brief, wasn't it?

206
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,400
It turns out you're nothing but worms after all.

207
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:11,650
It made you feel better, didn't it? Rambling about crap like that.

208
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,960
Son Goku!

209
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,710
He's dead.

210
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,010
More than one person is passed out!

211
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,010
The only one standing...

212
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,010
...is Piccolo!

213
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,290
Raditz is dead.

214
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,440
He was pathetic. Seriously.

215
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,160
Being killed by people whose battle power isn't much more than 1000?

216
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,650
What should we do? Shall we put this planet off for later and go?

217
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,750
They said something interesting.

218
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,840
Dragon Balls, was it?

219
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,330
Yeah. Sounds like they can grant any wish.

220
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,670
Okay then, let's go!

221
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,540
To bring Raditz back to life, right?

222
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,310
Don't make me laugh.

223
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,340
We don't need anyone useless like that.

224
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,630
We could live forever, never getting any older.

225
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,810
How does that sound?

226
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,860
If we do that, we'll be able to enjoy the thrill of battle forever.

227
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,720
I see now. That sounds great!

228
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,880
And that's what happened.

229
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,740
I... I see.

230
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,220
Goku! Goku, come on!

231
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,460
Please, Goku, you have to hold on!

232
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,460
Gohan-kun is fine.

233
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,420
He's just passed out.

234
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,980
Thank goodness.

235
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,680
He's come around.

236
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,620
Goku!

237
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,400
I don't have to hear Chichi shouting at me as I go.

238
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,160
Son-kun...

239
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,040
Kuririn...

240
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,640
Dying... is really... horrible... isn't it?

241
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,410
What are you saying, Goku?

242
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,200
Get a hold of yourself! This isn't like you!

243
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,820
I think it's too late this time.

244
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,040
Don't worry. We'll be able to bring you back soon.

245
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,700
I'm counting on you.

246
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,650
Goku!

247
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,660
GOKU!!!

248
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,610
Goku defeated Raditz by sacrificing himself.

249
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,030
However, a new foe is closing in on the Earth!

250
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,110
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! Give it your all in desperation

251
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,700
Fly into the infinite sky

252
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,750
Riding on a jet air current

253
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,450
You can go anywhere instantly

254
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,380
Being reckless is the best

255
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,630
Let's go tip-top! All right?

256
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,090
The Earth is so blue that it's dazzling

257
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:16,060
And we'll never surrender our irreplaceable planet

258
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,100
Send a Kamehameha bursting through the air!

259
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,110
I was born in these dangerous times...

260
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,070
...to protect the world

261
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,870
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! Give it your all in desperation

262
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,240
Do it! Full power

263
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,250
My weapon is hope

264
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,920
So believe in the future

265
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,140
Hey, this is Goku!

266
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,630
Wow! I really died, huh!

267
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,840
What? You don't want to go to Heaven, you say?

268
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,390
G-Great King Enma!

269
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:01,850
You can train at Kaio-sama's, but don't blame me if you fall off the Snake Road!

270
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,980

However, the danger to the Earth has only just begun.

For Kuririn and the others who remain, Goku's sacrifice weighs heavy.

I wonder if Gohan's fitting in well.

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,830
It'll be fine, anyway.

27
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,940
He's a well-behaved boy.

Hey, Gohan-chan!

33
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,640
I've brought you lots of presents!

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,860
Oh, daddy.

- Goku!
- Please, Goku!

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,850

00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,370
I don't want you to die!

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,910
Goku!

42
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,380
Goku!

43
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,230
He vanished!

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,930
I see. This must be Kami's doing.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,030
Only he would be capable of something like this.

46
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,120
He must have some worthless plan in mind.

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,120
I wonder what he's planning.

48
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,070
But if it's Kami-sama, we can rest easy.

49
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,850
Either way, we have to hurry up and find the other six balls...

50
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,780
...and bring Goku back to life.

51
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,590
Honestly! Where could Yamcha and the others have got to at an important time like this?

52
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,990
Didn't you chase him away yourself?

53
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,560
By the way, how did that guy, Goku's older brother, find us so easily?

54
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,760
It was that strange device he wore on his face.

55
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,390
Huh?

56
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,350
It seems it can tell his enemies' strength and location.

57
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,290
Kuririn...

58
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,120
Y-Yes?

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,120
Y-Yes, sure...

60
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,720
That thing... Kuririn, take it.

61
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,480
What!? U-Uh, sure...

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,000
He's not going to come back to life or anything, is he...

63
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,040
So this part goes like this...

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,610
This is an amazing piece of equipment.
It's a bit broken, but I'll make do somehow.

65
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,280
You're amazing, Bulma-san!

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,870
If I take this, research it and and make some modifications,

67
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,290
I might be able to find Yamcha, plus Tenshinhan-san and his companions.

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,010
Well, in any case, let's go back to Kame House for now.

69
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,240
Yeah. We can't do anything here.

70
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,360
Then I'll go and search for the Dragon Balls right after that.

71
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,170
Piccolo, what do you intend to do?

72
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,500
Like a lizard's tail!

73
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,610
You lot should search for the Dragon Balls.

74
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,330
Kami isn't powerful enough to revive the dead.

75
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,840
But I'll be taking Son Goku's son.

76
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,010
Wh-What are you planning?

77
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,430
With training, that brat, Son Gohan, can become a powerful fighter.

78
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:23,060
When those two Saiyans arrive in one year,
we will have his power to use against them as well.

79
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,860
For that purpose, I must train him.

80
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,070
Th-That's quite a thing to say...

81
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,890
I-Is it really the best idea?

82
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,150
Shouldn't we ask Goku or the boy's mother, Chichi, first?

83
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,330
There's no time for that!

84
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,770
If you're going to object, I'll take him even if I have to kill you all!

85
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,350
In one year, I will go to your house with this boy.

86
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,880
If Son Goku comes back to life, tell him to look forward to it.

87
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,210
I can't believe it. I can't believe it!

88
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,580
He's going to die! And even if he's lucky, he'll turn bad!

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,490
So you see, he has come in his real body to ask if he might be allowed to train.

90
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,720
I beg of you, Great King Enma-sama, allow this man to travel to Kaio-sama's.

91
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,700
Son Goku? Granted, your achievements are very impressive.

92
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:52,500
So even though he could go to heaven, he instead wants to
purposely face the danger of the Snake Road to meet Kaio-sama?

93
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,490
Yes.

94
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,960
Does everyone come here when they die?

95
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,790
That's right.

96
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,000
Even aliens?

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,860
Yes. This is where everyone is judged to determine whether they will go to heaven or hell.

98
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,630
Hey! Did some dude called Raditz get here just before me?

99
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,990
Come on! Be a bit more formal!

100
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,810
Yeah, he was definitely here.

101
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,030
Your brother, right?

102
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,680
He went to hell, of course.

103
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,180
He didn't put up a fight?

104
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,070
He did up a fight! But I subdued him.

105
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,570
You're pretty strong to be able to beat someone as impressive as him!

106
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,520
Maybe I can get this old geezer to train me!

107
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't talk to the Great King Enma like that!

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,120
But...

109
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,090
Be quiet! Kaio-sama is even stronger!

110
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,090
I heard that, God of the Earth.

111
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,010
He heard!

112
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,130
Maybe I'll send you to hell when you die!

113
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,920
P-Please forgive me! For you to have heard that, you must have a hell of a good set of ears!

114
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,420
That was a terrible joke.

115
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,230
It sure was.

116
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,600
Very well. If he wants to go to Kaio-sama's that badly, he may go.

117
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
Thank you most kindly.

118
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,660
I'll call a guide, so please go out that way and wait.

119
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:27,770
OK!

120
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,710
However!

121
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,090
Don't come crying to me if you fall off the Snake Road.

122
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,380
Well then, good luck.

123
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,260
It'll be a tough year.

124
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,070
Yeah. I don't really get any of this, but at any rate I'll go and meet this Kaio-sama guy.

125
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,640
Thanks. And say hi to Mr Popo for me!

126
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,190
Regardless, my Earth is being targeted by some terrible foes.

127
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,540
This might be the first time it has truly been in danger.

128
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,620
Even if we asked Shen Long to kill them, the Saiyans' extraordinary strength would probably defeat his.

129
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,640
And even if Son Goku trains under Kaio-sama, how much progress will he make?

130
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,040
Our one saving grace is Goku's son.

131
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,390
How will Piccolo raise Son Gohan?

132
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,700
But there's so little time left...

133
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,190
Shut up!

134
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,170
You're being a nuisance! Go home already!

135
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,810
S-Sorry! Sorry! I'm very sorry!

136
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,550
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,770
Sorry to keep you waiting.

138
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,720
I'll be taking you to the head of the snake.

139
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,820
The Snake Road is quite an ordeal.

140
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,490
Is your body in suitable condition?

141
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,930
I died, so I'm not feeling all that great.

142
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,660
Hey... What kind of person is Kaio-sama?

143
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,650
Kaio-sama is in charge of all the Kami, or Gods, in the universe.

144
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,990
He must be an amazing guy.

145
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,970
I guess we can't keep it a secret from Chichi.

146
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,560
Kuririn, you should go there quickly and explain.

147
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,610
M-Me?

148
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,770
She seems like a really overprotective mother, so she'll probably kill you.

149
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,560
Well then, we're here.

150
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,830
So this is the Snake Road?

151
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,750
Yes.

152
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,410
What do I do now?

153
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,060
Please simply continue along this snake.

154
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,750
Then you will arrive at Kaio-sama's place.

155
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,400
Is that so?

156
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,690
Yes. In total it's approximately 1,000,000 kilometres.

157
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,460
1 million kilometres?!

158
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,260
Has anyone ever made it?!

159
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,160
In the past 100 million years, Great King Enma is the only one.

160
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,160
That guy, huh?

161
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,710
But if someone else has done it, I guess I can manage it somehow.

162
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh yes. Please be very careful not to fall in the clouds.

163
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,420
Hell is situated below the clouds, so you'll never return.

164
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,710
I see.

165
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,760
Darn it. I wish I'd brought a packed lunch.

166
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:17,710
It's all right, sir. You're already deceased, so I don't think you can die again.

167
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,890
You don't say!

168
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,400
I'll be off then.

169
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,320
Oh yeah. There's something I wanted you to do for me.

170
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,110
Yes?

171
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,220
Do you know Fortune Teller Baba?

172
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,120
Yes, she comes here from time to time.

173
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:41,040
Thank goodness! If she comes here soon, make sure she tells the old Turtle Hermit not to bring me back to life for another year.

174
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,630
Understood. Um, so it's one year...

175
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,180
Tell the Turtle Hermit, correct?

176
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,530
Well, time to get going.

177
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,430
So basically it's fine as long as I don't fall off the snake, right?

178
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,350
Yes. Absolutely.

179
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,770
Flying technique!

180
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,900
Unfortunately, Goku was killed. I'm so sorry for your loss.

181
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,080
Maybe that would be too much of a shock.

182
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,300
It's a real shame, but Goku has finally entered eternal sleep, never to return.

183
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,680
But we're going to bring him back to life, aren't we...

184
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,000
That's right! I can be cheerful about it!

185
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,530
Goku's dead, but we'll bring him back soon enough, so don't worry!

186
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,850
Kuririn!

187
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,200
H-H-Hello!

188
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,800
What are you talking to yourself out here for?

189
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,360
W-W-Well you see, wh-wh-what happened was...

190
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,370
Hey! It's been a while!

191
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,420
Hello. N-Nice to see you.

192
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,090
Aren't you with Goku-sa and the others?

193
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,500
Well you see, the truth is, Goku's...

194
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,600
De... De...

195
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,180
De... De...

196
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,210
What happened?

197
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,630
Definitely okay! He wanted me to tell you so you wouldn't worry!

198
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,560
What? He's going to be late back after all?

199
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,400
Y-Yes! The truth is, Goku... won't be coming back.

200
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,150
He won't be coming back?

201
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,870
W-Well, he'll be back soon.

202
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,800
What are you saying? I don't understand!

203
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,150
Anyway, don't keep standing there. We can talk inside.

204
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,410
Come on.

205
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,480
Open your eyes already, son of Son Goku!

206
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,460
I need to talk to you. Get up out of the water.

207
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,840
Who are you?

208
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,630
Father!

209
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,690
Father! Where are you?

210
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,790
Father! Father!

211
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,550
Father! I'm scared!

212
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,520
Bah. Damn brat.

213
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,690
Don't be so difficult.

214
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,320
Stop crying! If you don't shut up I'll break your damn neck!

215
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,760
Okay? Listen to me carefully.

216
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,820
Firstly, your father is dead.

217
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,760
You must remember some of it.

218
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,560
He sacrificed himself in order to defeat that man.

219
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,720
Piccolo, quick! Use that technique again!

220
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,810
Do it!

221
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,690
Take this!

222
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,610
Makankosappo!

223
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,100
Father!

224
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,360
Stop crying!

225
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,500
Do you want me to actually break your neck?

226
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,760
You've heard about the Dragon Balls from your father, correct?

227
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,730
Son Goku's friends should be able to gather them and bring him back to life.

228
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,970
But that's not the problem.

229
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,640
We somehow dealt with the guy who kidnapped you,

230
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,780
but it seems that in a year, comrades of his that are even stronger will arrive.

231
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:22,580
When that happens, and Son Goku is revived, he and I alone will have almost no chance of victory.

232
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,720
We need your power.

233
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,790
Train hard, learn fighting techniques, and protect the Earth!

234
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,180
Me?

235
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,130
But... I can't fight at all!

236
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,410
It seems you haven't realised it yourself,

237
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,030
but you have considerable power hidden within you.

238
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,260
That's why you need to unleash that power through training and learn to use it properly.

239
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,350
You're lying! I don't have power like that!

240
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,090
Would you like to see proof?

241
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,060
What?

242
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,310
What are you doing?

243
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,120
It hurts! It hurts!

244
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,550
Stop!

245
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,460
It hurts! Stop!

246
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,660
It hurts! It hurts, it hurts!

247
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,960
Go on, show me your hidden power!

248
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,900
Th... This is...

249
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,530
I'm... I'm shocked. He's even stronger than I thought.

250
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,430
I have mixed feelings.

251
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,790
I might be training someone who will become my most powerful enemy in the future.

252
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,320
Did I do that?

253
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,170
Yes. I see you're starting to understand.

254
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,520
You can only fully unleash your tremendous power when your emotions are heightened.

255
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,020
However, it's only for a moment.

256
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,690
We can't win with that alone.

257
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,760
I will teach you how to fight and make you into the ultimate warrior.

258
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,930
Do you understand?

259
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,200
But I don't want to be a martial artist.

260
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,960
I want to be a great scholar.

261
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,400
You still can.

262
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,870
But after you defeat the two Saiyans in one year's time.

263
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,300
They plan to wipe out the Earth's entire population.

264
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,970
If they succeed, you won't have any damn future.

265
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,760
But I'm scared.

266
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,890
Cut the crap!

267
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,770
Do you want me to smash you to pieces right now?!

268
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,270
There's no time! We have to start right now!

269
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,050
Now take off your tunic!

270
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:06,320
If my father's going to come back to life, I want him to teach me!

271
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,850
Too bad. He is strong, to be fair, but he wouldn't make a good master.

272
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,920
He could never be strict towards anyone.

273
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,040
You can see that just by looking at how coddled you are.

274
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,440
Huh?

275
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,680
Darn. I used up too much of my strength and now I can't fly.

276
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,470
With no idea of his son's grief,

277
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:43,150

I miss you, Father!

00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,780
Huh? It's a full moon!

297
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,020
I've never seen one before!

298
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,350
Son Goku's son is growing huge! Is it because of his Saiyan heritage?

299
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,520
Next time on Dragon Ball Kai:

Meanwhile, Piccolo had kidnapped Son Gohan,

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,580
with the intent to give him intense training.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,960

You don't have to do anything at first.

55
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,640
Just survive.

56
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,410
Survive?

57
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,900

58
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,510

You won't be lonely.

61
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,700
This place is swarming with blood-thirsty monsters.

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,060
Please don't do that!

63
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,540
Don't leave me behind!

Right now there is no time for you to act like a spoiled brat!

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
But I...

66
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,830
You will somehow have to toughen up and survive for six months.

67
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,280
Both in body and mind.

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,580
Do not forget that you are holding the key to this planet's future!

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,850
Believe in your own power.

70
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,260
And figure out by yourself how to effectively draw out that power.

71
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,010
But I...

72
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,780
See you.

73
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,550
Wait! Where can I find food?

74
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,580
What about a bath and a bed?

75
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,080
Do you really think I'm going to prepare those things for you, spoiled brat?

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,820
If you want to blame anyone, blame your own fate, just like I do.

77
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,180
Wait!

78
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,080
I'm scared!

79
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,650
Don't leave me behind!

80
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,280
Kami-sama, you look troubled.

81
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,650
Is something the matter?

82
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,070
That Piccolo really does seem different than before.

83
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,020
He is definitely still evil.

84
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,390
But I get the feeling he's not as sly and violent as he used to be.

85
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,690
Popo thinks so too.

86
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,480
The old Daimao wouldn't try to make Son Goku's son stronger.

87
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,940
The moment from when I knew there was something amiss,

88
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,410
was when he killed Son Goku's older brother, Raditz,

89
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,260
and his soul properly passed over to the afterlife.

90
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,720
Usually, the souls of those killed by demons cannot rest in peace,

91
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,720
and would continue to drift in space, suffering.

92
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,630
However, the fact that Raditz went to the afterlife proves that Piccolo is clearly different than before.

93
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,610
So Piccolo might have good in his heart?

94
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,290
Perhaps he is even aware of it.

95
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,840
The fact that my, and thus Piccolo's life as well, will end in one year.

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,770
In one year?

97
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:04,300
I do not know however, if that is because Piccolo will be killed by the Saiyans in one year,

98
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,120
or because my life happens to naturally end at that time.

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,550
If I die, then Piccolo dies as well.

100
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,790
And Piccolo's death is my death as well.

101
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,520
I may be a God, but knowing when my life ends is not a pleasant thing.

102
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,770
He probably feels this too.

103
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,360
He must be wanting to leave something behind.

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,660
Even if that is something as the child of Son Goku.

105
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,290
Then the Dragon Balls will be...

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,180
Yes, the next time will probably be the last.

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,010
I really had no idea that Gohan was that strong.

108
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,060
He really is my kid!

109
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,300
I see!

110
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,900
No one said I had to actually walk along the road, right?

111
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,940
Like this, I'll reach the goal in no time!

112
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,550
That was close.

113
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,050
Beneath those clouds is hell.

114
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,300
Help me!

115
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,500
Someone, help me!

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,110
I can't get down!

117
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,050
I'm scared!

118
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,110
Damn!

119
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:07,810
That guy told me I wouldn't get hungry because I'm dead, but I still am!

120
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:13,980
What?

121
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,360
You didn't tell her?

122
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,340
I'm very sorry.

123
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,240
Don't tell me... you didn't say anything?

124
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,790
Yeah...

125
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,560
You're hopeless.

126
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,750
You can never deal with these things.

127
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,310
Even if you say that...

128
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,380
When I saw Chi-Chi-san's face, I just couldn't tell her Goku is dead.

129
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,120
Well, I can't blame you.

130
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,340
But at this rate...

131
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,810
If we write her a letter and explain the situation, then maybe she'd be able to understand.

132
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,650
Yeah!

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,140
That's a good idea.

134
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,280
By the way, Kuririn...

135
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,880
What about the Dragon Balls?

136
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,940
Son-kun had two of them, right?

137
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,990
I forgot!

138
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,100
You're useless!

139
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,790
I'm scared and cold...

140
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,820
I'll die of starvation...

141
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,550
An apple!

142
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,130
Some apples fell down!

143
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,250
Lucky!

144
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,320
Oh, well.

145
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,300
They're sour! How gross!

146
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,520
I wanna eat Chinese dumplings!

147
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,910
I wanna eat Chinese dumplings!

148
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,120
That stupid brat.

149
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,040
Making me do stuff for him.

150
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,020
Scary... I'm scared.

151
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,870
But get this clear.

152
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,440
This is the last time I help you.

153
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,910
If you cannot survive on your own after this,

154
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,070
then it means you're just a spoiled brat.

155
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,430
It's bright!

156
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,000
I can't get down!

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,420
I'm hungry!

158
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,260
I'm scared!

159
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,680
If he's hungry he should just get down and find something to eat.

160
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,970
Even when I told him to be back before night....

161
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,400
It's been such a long while since he visited Kame House.

162
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,920
He probably just lost track of time during all the chatting.

163
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,290
That might be fine for Goku-sa,

164
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,400
but Gohan has cram school!

165
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,590
Skipping a day or so can't hurt.

166
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,080
You're naive, dad!

167
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,900
In the world of tomorrow, those who study will win!

168
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,880
How about this.

169
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,800
Hey!

170
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,920
It's finally done!

171
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,240
To think that you guys are so relaxed that you'd even sleep...

172
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,130
Hey, Old Turtle over there.

173
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,540
Stand up.

174
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,450
Old Turtle?

175
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,310
I changed it to display more understandable symbols.

176
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,920
Let's see...

177
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,240
It's 139.

178
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,830
139?

179
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm not that young.

180
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,580
This number indicates your strength, Muten Roshi-sama.

181
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,660
A number to indicate strength?

182
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,430
That's an amazing device.

183
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,130
You can actually see that with that thing?

184
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,560
Bulma-san!

185
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,510
How much do I get?

186
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,350
Amazing! It's 206!

187
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,480
It really looks like I surpassed you, Muten Roshi-sama!

188
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,860
Are you sure it's not broken?

189
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,860
I don't mean to brag, but I'm highly skilled.

190
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,790
Who is it?

191
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,660
He sure got a weird way of greeting.

192
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
It's me.

193
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,680
You must be the guy from Karin-sama's place...

194
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,320
Armadillo!

195
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,190
It's Yajirobe, you idiot!

196
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,920
You're mistaking my name like it's on purpose!

197
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,980
I was told by Karin to deliver a message to you.

198
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,090
A message from Karin-sama?

199
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,860
I know all the circumstances.

200
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,370
So he told me,

201
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,770
that you and Yamcha, and Ten-something and Chao-whatever should come over quickly.

202
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,780
We all have to go to Karin's Tower?

203
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,450
Why?

204
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,210
Kami-sama said he'd train all of you.

205
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,400
I'm going there too.

206
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,420
Really?!

207
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,420
Yeah.

208
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,740
I told him that I'm not that strong and don't want to fight aliens or whatever,

209
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,340
but he really kept pushing me.

210
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,310
So I gave up.

211
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,170
U-Understood!

212
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,630
I'll look for the others and come right away.

213
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,360
Later.

214
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,010
I delivered the message.

215
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,660
Oh, oops.

216
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,060
Almost forgot something.

217
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,170
That Goku guy said not to revive him until the enemies arrive.

218
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,890
Wh-Why?

219
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,840
That guy's training in the afterlife.

220
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,600
If you want details, that Old Fortuneteller hag will be here soon, so ask her.

221
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,090
Wh-What? When?

222
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,120
Training in the afterlife...

223
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,700
Wh-What the!

224
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,870
Huh?

225
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,670
He's coming back.

226
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey!

227
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,590
Muten Roshi-sama!

228
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,000
Chi-Chi and Gyu Mao!

229
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,630
Muten Roshi-sama...

230
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,850
What should we do?

231
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,820
I still haven't written any letter.

232
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,330
Muten Roshi-sama!

233
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,550
It's been a while! How have you been?

234
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,120
Not bad.

235
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,670
My Goku-sa and Gohan are supposed to be here.

236
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:21,990
Where are they?

237
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,120
U-Umm...

238
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,950
Actually...

239
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,590
He was kidnapped by Piccolo Daimao?!

240
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,140
Wh-What happened to Goku?!

241
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,680
He died.

242
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,170
Chi-Chi! Hang in there!

243
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,880
Why did this happen to me?

244
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,700
Why is it so bright?

245
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,220
It's the moon!

246
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,370
It's all round!

247
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,980
This is my first time...

248
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,610
seeing the moo-

249
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:40,840
What the?!

250
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,370
If this goes on, the Earth will be destroyed before the Saiyans even arrive!

251
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,490
Wh-What's going on?!

252
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,250
Don't play dumb!

253
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:19,630
You should know that we Saiyans can only show our true potentional when there's a full moon!

254
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,980
I see!

255
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,200
It's the full moon!

256
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,030
To think that he'd transform...

257
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,060
It must be the Saiyan blood.

258
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,650
I seem to have found the reason behind Son Goku's strength.

259
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,160
Looks like I made the right choice by blowing up the moon.

260
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,010
I shudder to think what would've happened if those Saiyans transformed like that...

261
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,940
He did say something about the tail.

262
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,000
It seems like both the full moon and the tail are needed to transform.

263
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,620
Should I remove the tail too?

264
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,340
There's no need to worry anymore.

265
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,380
But it seems the tail is the Saiyan's weakness.

266
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,590
Alright.

267
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,970
I will give you clothes and a sword as a service.

268
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,830
I will give them the same design as your father's.

269
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,110
The symbol is a bit different though.

270
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,280
Symbol: ma (demon)

271
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,990
I have training to do as well,

272
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,700
so I'm leaving now.

273
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,290
If you manage to survive for the upcoming six months,

274
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,370
I will personally give you a taste of Piccolo-sama's training from Hell.

275
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,590
It'll be so tough, that you shall think you'd be better off dead.

276
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,360
Prepare for it.

277
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,640
And then...

278
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,620
I'll turn you into a fine demon.

279
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,030
The Saiyans are worn out.

280
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,950
The hardships brought upon Chi-Chi and her son still continue.

281
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,130

282

00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,590
Let's go, tip-top! All right?

293
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,130
Let's go, tip-top! All right?

294
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,590
Let's go, tip-top! All right?

Hey! I'm Goku!

314
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,890
Alright! I can see the Snake's tail!

315
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,590
Did you hear about Snake Way? It's a LONG story.

316
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,020
Why did you come to this heavy Heaven? Get it?!

317
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,370
Could it be that you're Kaio-sama?

318
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,780
Next time on Dragon Ball Kai.

319
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,150

Gohan, having seen a full moon for the first time, transformed into a Great Ape.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,820
In order to suppress that incredible destructive power, Piccolo destroyed the entire moon.

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,860
And Gohan's tail was removed.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,890
I've got my own training to do.

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,210
I'm leaving now.

00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,910

Alright.

55
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,290
What? You don't know when to give up, do you?

56
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,650
I'm over here!

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,500
Well then, I'm going to take another slice!

58
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,880
You'll lose your tail if you keep this up.

59
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,580
It looks like he's getting the hang of it.

60
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,790
Not yet?

61
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,300
Just how far is Kaio-sama's place?

62
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,680
Well, if we got this many people,
those Saiyans don't scare me a bit.

63
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,560
I'm looking forward to see what kind of training we'll get from Kami-sama.

64
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,080
It looks like during this half year,

65
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,650
you've become a bit more stronger.

66
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,080
Now then, I guess it's time to get serious.

67
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,920
Come.

68
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,230
What's the matter?!

69
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,220
Over here!

70
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,770
Don't lose sight of your target!

71
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,560
I can't see you if you're that fast.

72
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,480
You must not see me.

73
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,570
Sense it.

74
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,730
That's easy for you to say...

75
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,000
I still can't see the tail.

76
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,750
It's the tail!

77
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,300
Alright! I'm there!

78
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,070
There's nothing here.

79
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,070
That can't be right.

80
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,310
What's that?

81
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,370
It's over there!

82
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,880
Kaio-sama must be there!

83
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,940
I was right!

84
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,410
There's a house!

85
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,190
What's wrong with the ground?!

86
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,990
Damnit...

87
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,940
It's like I'm being pulled down by an incredible force...

88
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,760
I-It's no use...

89
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,230
I-It's as if my entire body is lead...

90
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,310
Damnit...

91
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,730
I'm gonna do it.

92
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,290
I've come this far...

93
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,310
I'm definitely... going to see Kaio-sama!

94
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,000
Just a little... bit more...

95
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
Just a little...

96
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,550
Before that, I'll find something to eat.

97
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,420
Kaio-sama?

98
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,630
Are you Kaio-sama?

99
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,510
He must be amazing, even if he looks like that.

100
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,140
Greetings!

101
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,120
I am Son Goku.

102
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,650
I seek training from you.

103
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,310
Kaio-sama.

104
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,950
Teach me martial arts.

105
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,910
I mean, please.

106
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,130
That's the training?

107
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,750
You want me to move like that?

108
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,420
Kaio-sama!

109
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,930
W-What's wrong with the ground here?

110
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,370
Hey, what are you doing?

111
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,300
It sure is warm.

112
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,760
What are you doing, exactly?

113
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,210
H-Huh?

114
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,170
You are...

115
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,650
Me?

116
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,270
I am...

117
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,800
("Kaii yo" means "I'm itchy")

118
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,800
So itchy... So itchy...

119
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,990
So itchy... So itchy...

120
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,330
I'm Kaio.

121
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,120
Then he is...

122
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,990
That's my pet, Bubbles-kun.

123
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,970
Really?

124
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,400
I knew something was strange.

125
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,630
You're the strange one.

126
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,930
By the way...

127
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,820
Don't you think that joke just now was the greatest?

128
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,770
Don't hold back, you can laugh if you want.

129
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,150
At what?

130
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,940
I guess you were too nervous to hear it.

131
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,620
What a hopeless guy, seriously.

132
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,200
Then I'll just tell another joke as a service.

133
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,370
Ring, ring.

134
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,500
Click.

135
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,040
Hello, hello?

136
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,080
Huh?

137
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,500
("Denwa" means "phone", and "den wa" means "answering"

138
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,590
No one's answering the phone.

139
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,800
Hilarious!

140
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,340
What is?

141
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,780
Why did you come here?

142
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,610
I'd like to request training from you!

143
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,600
Training, you say?

144
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,420
What? You call that defense?

145
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,530
Concentrate more!

146
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,730
I'm itching to kill you!

147
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,460
Training, huh.

148
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,810
That's fine.

149
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,530
Really?!

150
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,520
However.

151
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,500
That is, after you pass the test.

152
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:11,380
You have to make me, the King of Jokes, laugh from a joke.

153
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,870
I have to tell a joke?!

154
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,290
Have you gotten cold feet?

155
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,880
I won't laugh unless it's a really good joke.

156
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,550
Well, what do you have?

157
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,010
It looks like there's no hope for you.

158
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,380
So give up and go home!

159
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,520
("futtonda" means "blew up")

160
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,520
T-The futon...blew up!

161
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,800
The futon... blew up?

162
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,710
Just a bit more...

163
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,620
("neko" means "cat", and "nekoronda" means "lied down")

164
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,620
The cat... lied down!

165
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,750
("enpitsu" means "pencil", and "mienpitsu" means "seeing")

166
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,750
The pencil was seen!

167
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,700
You laughed!

168
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,010
I made Kaio-sama laugh!

169
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,680
("hirame" means "flounder", and "hirameta" means "flickered")

170
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,680
The flounder flickered.

171
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,850
I see you're not just anyone.

172
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,020
You must be a professional.

173
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,660
Fine then.

174
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,270
I will train you.

175
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,810
I'll teach you...

176
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,950
...the ultimate joke!

177
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,660
I don't care about jokes.

178
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,240
Teach me martial arts!

179
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,730
What, you meant martial arts?

180
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,860
Why didn't you just say so from the start?

181
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,630
Alright, come at me.

182
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,170
I'll find out how skillful you are.

183
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,090
What's wrong?

184
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,930
You see, it's strange...

185
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,040
It's really hard to move here, and my body feels heavy.

186
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,930
Where did you come from? Earth?

187
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,060
Yeah.

188
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,710
Then that's probably why.

189
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,880
This is a tiny planet but it's gravity is immense.

190
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,360
About ten times bigger than your planet's.

191
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,550
That also means your body weight is ten times what it normally is.

192
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,180
Try jumping, with all your strength.

193
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,550
It's no use.

194
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,420
I can't get higher than that.

195
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,170
He can jump that high when the gravity is ten times his own gravity...

196
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,210
This is going to be interesting.

197
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,610
Well then, let's begin your training.

198
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,440
How long are you planning to stay?

199
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,070
I don't know how many days I spent running on Snake Way...

200
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,580
But I don't think I have many left.

201
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,350
These guys called "Saiyans" are coming to our planet to do some terrible things.

202
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,000
Just teach me as much as you can in the time we've got!

203
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,210
Saiyans, huh?

204
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,840
Seems like you've gotten the attention of some very troublesome people.

205
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,970
Let's see...

206
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,120
Let's find out at which time the Saiyans will reach Earth.

207
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,000
It indeed looks like they're flying this way.

208
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,160
They'll reach Earth in about...

209
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,420
Let's say, in about another 158 days.

210
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,340
Wow! You can do that?!

211
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,630
("ante na" means "have")

212
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,630
It's because I have these antennas.

213
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,420
Hilarious, no?

214
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,940
Maybe I should give up on training you.

215
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,440
It was hilarious!

216
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,610
Right?

217
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,110
But wait, we only have 158 days until the Saiyans arrive?

218
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,530
So? 158 days should be plenty of time.

219
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,760
If I train you on this planet for 158 days,

220
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,880
it would be the same as training for thousands of years on Earth.

221
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,950
Really?!

222
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,380
However...

223
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,670
Even if you train here, it doesn't mean you will be able to defeat those Saiyans.

224
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:24,980
That's just how strong those two Saiyans heading for Earth are.

225
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,230
To be honest, those two are stronger than me.

226
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,030
They're stronger than you?!

227
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,510
Exactly.

228
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:41,200
Which means that if you don't at the very least surpass me, you don't stand a chance against the Saiyans.

229
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,160
Now then, let's get started already.

230
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,280
Hey, Bubbles-kun.

231
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,590
First of all.

232
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,910
Your first task is to surpass this massive gravity by catching Bubbles-kun.

233
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:12,020
There's no point in training you if you can't at least move fast enough.

234
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,770
I understand.

235
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,650
Now, run away, Bubbles-kun!

236
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,410
Wait!

237
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,530
D-Damnit...

238
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,210
My body's really heavy...

239
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,200
Damnit!

240
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,680
Alright!

241
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,270
Watch this!

242
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,670
I will definitely catch you.

243
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,070
So he already had extra weights on him.

244
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,490
With this I've gotten much lighter!

245
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,750
Take this!

246
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,880
Goku's intense training has finally begun.

247
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:32,470
Will he be able to overcome the gravity of Kaio-sama's planet, which is as much as ten times that of Earth?

248
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:39,030
There are only 158 days left until the Saiyans arrive at Earth.

249
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,710
The trials have only just begun.

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,130

00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,130
Let's go, tip-top! All right?

I'll catch you for sure, Bubbles!

285
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,720
Between training, I eat plenty of pudding!

286
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,480
I really am a genius!

287
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,490
Maybe I should give up on your training.

288
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,090
It was hilarious!

289
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,220

Goku, Your Training is a Footrace!

52
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,320
That's one way to eat...

53
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,710
This is a little...

54
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,130
Hey, can't you restrain yourself a little?!

55
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,730
("danburi" means "bowl", "bundoru" means "took")

56
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,730
I took your bowl!

57
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,600
He took my bowl!

58
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,740
What was the joke in that?

59
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,870
I'm stuffed.

60
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,360
Despite the taste, that really managed to fill me up!

61
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,330
I wonder if this man actually respects me.

62
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,340
Say, Kaio-sama.

63
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,930
Don't you get tired of such a tiny planet?

64
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,420
How naive.

65
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,900
You should know that there are tons of fun things to do here.

66
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,940
Such as counting how many strands of grass there are,

67
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,470
or gazing at the sky.

68
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,030
You can even try to pee for long distances.

69
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,830
Recently, my most favorite hobby is...

70
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,260
...driving, of course!

71
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,780
Now hurry up and catch Bubbles-kun.

72
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,050
If you don't, you will never be able to learn martial arts from me!

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,430
I'll do my best!

74
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,740
Alright!

75
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,770
Oh, that's right.

76
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,090
Put those heavy clothes from before on again, and try running once more.

77
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,450
The training will be more effective that way.

78
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,460
If I put that on again, it'll be even harder to run!

79
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,000
Let me tell you something interesting.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,870
The gravity on the Saiyan's home planet was the same as this planet's.

81
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,380
They have trained their bodies there.

82
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,100
Do you understand what I mean?

83
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,530
That's the secret of the Saiyan's power.

84
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,420
But that's not all.

85
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,330
The Saiyans are born with an unusual instinct for fighting.

86
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,850
And that's another of their tricky parts.

87
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,680
Nothing to worry about!

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,590
I'm a Saiyan as well.

89
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,180
Nice thrust.

90
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,210
Don't leave an opening in your stance!

91
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,350
Mister!

92
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,830
Help me!

93
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,070
Don't be so cocky, you damn brat!

94
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,970
As I thought, his true power can only manifest during a full moon.

95
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,070
Looks like during this half year you've stopped being a crybaby.

96
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,680
Hey, you have fought with my dad in the past, right?

97
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,090
That fight hasn't ended yet.

98
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,560
Once I've taken care of those Saiyans, your dad is next.

99
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,520
But daddy told me...

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,570
That the reborn Piccolo isn't a malicious bad guy like he was before.

101
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
I think so too.

102
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,570
Mommy and grandpa were still afraid, though.

103
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,850
Stop spouting bullshit and go to sleep already!

104
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,070
I won't be going so easy on you tomorrow!

105
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,840
Yes, sir!

106
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,070
That stupid brat.

107
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,190
And with a blink of an eye, three weeks had passed.

108
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,920
Steamed meat dumplings are delicious!

109
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,680
("kimi" = "you", "shumai" = "dumpling", "shirumai" = "don't know")

110
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,680
You dumpling, you dumbling, you dumb thing!

111
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,920
Hilarious!

112
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,660
Oh?

113
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,990
Nobody... was listening?

114
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,670
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

115
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,190
("gyoza" are Japanese dumplings, "gyousan" means "abundance")

116
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,190
There's an abundance of gyoza here!

117
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,240
Wait up!

118
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,990
Now's my chance!

119
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,380
Ouch!

120
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,730
Damnit!

121
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,680
Alright!

122
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,640
You sure are energetic!

123
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,410
Wait up!

124
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,250
You guys really don't have any respect for me!

125
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,290
That guy really is amazing.

126
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,900
But I won't lose!

127
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,650
I was so close.

128
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,640
That's right!

129
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,730
Alright!

130
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,310
I knew it!

131
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,010
Alright!

132
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,950
Wait up!

133
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,010
Wait up!

134
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,060
I did it!

135
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,640
I finally did it!

136
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,850
I've caught you!

137
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,060
He really is amazing, as I thought.

138
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,480
He is already used to this planet's gravity.

139
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,370
He might be able to master the Kaio-ken.

140
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,620
Get up already!

141
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,730
Don't get comfortable just because you dodged me once or twice.

142
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,800
You're still too naive!

143
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,410
Please help me!

144
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,220
Get up on your own strength!

145
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,830
This is the Japanese word game "Shiritori": you take the last kana of the previous word to make a new word.

146
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,980
Squirrel!

147
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,560
Watermelon!

148
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
Seagull!

149
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,570
Killifish!

150
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,830
Monster!

151
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,180
Cow!

152
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,740
Polar Bear!

153
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,900
Ball!

154
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,380
Apple!

155
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,630
Gorilla!

156
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,390
Lion!

157
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,000
Try saying the next!

158
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,140
Ten-san and Yamcha-san have become so amazing!

159
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,740
Yajirobe! Take this seriously!

160
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,800
You...!

161
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,120
I did it!

162
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,400
I finally did it!

163
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,790
Kaio-sama, what should I do next?

164
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,690
What should you do? Let's see...

165
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,380
Will you do anything?

166
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:52,960
Yeah.

167
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,220
("nandemo suru" means "do anything", "gomademo suru" means "prepare sesame")

168
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,220
Then will you prepare some sesame?

169
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,800
Kaio-sama, if I don't get my next training quickly, the Saiyans will...

170
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,310
Don't be so impatient.

171
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,720
We still have 135 days left.

172
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,050
That'll be over before you know it!

173
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,900
What is it?

174
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,920
It should be coming back around now.

175
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,580
Come back?

176
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,950
Look, there it is.

177
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,490
(A rather complicated pun.)

178
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,490
That was in a blink of time.

179
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,360
That was hilarious, I'm on a roll!

180
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,790
Are you really that strong?

181
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,400
How rude of you!

182
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,970
Wh-What is that?

183
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,180
You look like a grasshopper.

184
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,890
A grasshopper?!

185
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,630
(It sounds like "Sonna baka na" which means "That's impossible!")

186
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,630
That grasshopper, you know.

187
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,860
You're rude.

188
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,110
I am Kaio-sama's personal assistant, Gregory.

189
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,220
The great Kaio-sama who stands above all the Gods in the universe!

190
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,880
That grasshopper!

191
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:51,360
How dare you say something so disrespectful as "Are you really that strong?" to Kaio-sama!

192
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,480
("muchi" can mean both "ignorance" as well as "whip")

193
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,460
There's a limit to one's ignorance!

194
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,480
I don't have a whip.

195
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,780
Son Goku, your future looks rather promising.

196
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,970
Kaio-sama! This is no laughing matter!

197
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,780
Ah, Son Goku, Gregory here will replace Bubbles-kun as your ally.

198
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,310
This guy will?

199
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,470
What's with that face?!

200
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,640
I want to be taught directly by Kaio-sama.

201
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,110
Kaio-sama! I am completely agitated now!

202
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,690
I'm thinking of breaking his nose for underestimating me!

203
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,200
Is that alright?

204
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,900
Very well.

205
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,380
What's that?

206
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,750
K-Kaio-sama, isn't that a little too big?

207
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,670
Son Goku.

208
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,260
Catch.

209
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,920
How is it? Heavy, right?

210
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,070
Your next training will be to use that hammer and knock out Gregory.

211
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,640
With this?

212
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,110
If you do a good job, I will train you personally.

213
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,830
Alright, I'll try!

214
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,320
As if a novice like you can catch me!

215
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,460
H-He's fast!

216
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,490
Damnit!

217
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,380
Looks like it'll take a while.

218
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,860
Alright, this time...!

219
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,840
That bastard!

220
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,260
Wait up!

221
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,160
Wait!

222
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,920
No way!

223
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,990
I wish they'd stick with just being energetic...

224
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,390
I'll definitely become stronger than the Saiyans!

225
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,940
Damnit!

226
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,930
You have surpassed me by long.

227
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,950
Me and Mr. Popo have nothing left to teach you.

228
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,300
Until the time comes to confront the enemy, you will descend,

229
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,730
and you should all train on your own.

230
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,570
I entrust the future to you.

231
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,430
Yes sir!

232
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,130
Is it okay to take these heavy clothing off now?

233
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,880
Do as you wish.

234
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,030
We should all get down and finish our training.

235
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,560
We can still power up a lot more.

236
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,890
Everyone's become so amazing!

237
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,500
Goku.

238
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,400
I look forward to seeing how strong you've become.

239
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,330
After holding onto the hammer for two weeks...

240
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,070
Just a bit more!

241
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,070
What a persistant guy.

242
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,720
Alright.

243
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,530
Crap!

244
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,440
Prepare yourself, Gregory!

245
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,590
I did it!

246
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,860
You should be glad I didn't hit you with all my strength!

247
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,090
How naive.

248
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,540
My body is even harder than stone!

249
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,790
You can't win against the Saiyans with that attitude!

250
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,360
Really?

251
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,730
But you've got a lump on your head.

252
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,760
Ouch!

253
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,430
There are only 118 days left.

254
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,220
He might be able to master the Kaio-ken.

255
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,640
The Kaio-ken is something I've always dreamed of but never been able to master.

256
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,120
And maybe that ultimate move, as well...

257
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,570
Kaio-sama, as promised...

258
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,570
I hope you're prepared for my training that's unimaginably tough!

259
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,720
Can you endure it?

260
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,410
Yep.

261
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,120
I'll try!

262
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:27,470
I might as well try to make you the strongest in the universe, in both body and soul!

263
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,390
Got it?!

264
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,310
Got it!

265
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,630
I want you to look into the future of the Earth, sister.

266
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,050
What? The future of the Earth?!

267
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,050
I'd like to know what happens next year.

268
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,060
I got it, let's see.

269
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,600
It didn't work.

270
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,340
It seems that even I cannot read this world's future.

271
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,640
Alright, that's it!

272
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,380
You're starting to get control over your Ki!

273
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,370
Naive!

274
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,670
What kind of art could the Kaio-ken be?

275
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,500
And what is that ultimate move?

276
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:29,100
The moment of truth is closing in with the minute.

277
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,060
ya bure ka bure omoikkiri

278
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,060
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! Give it all your best

279
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,650
tobunda mugen no sora he

280
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,650
Fly towards the infinite sky

281
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,650
jetto kiryuu ni nokkari

282
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,650
Riding on a jet current

283
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,400
doko demo iku yo sokkoo

284
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,400
you can go anywhere, instantly

285
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,280
mukou mizu tte saikou

286
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,280
Being reckless is simply the best

287
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,100
Let's go, tip-top! All right?

288
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,520
Let's go, tip-top! All right?

289
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,060
Let's go, tip-top! All right?

290
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,520
Let's go, tip-top! All right?

291
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,000
me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

292
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,000
The Earth is so blue that it's dazzling

293
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:16,960
kake ga enai kono hoshi yuzurenai kara

294
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:16,960
so we'll never surrender this irreplaceable planet!

295
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,010
hajike tobase kamehameha

296
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,010
Blast through the skies, kamehameha

297
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,010
yabame no kono jidai

298
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,010
In this dangerous time

299
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,980
sekai wo mamoru tame umareta kara

300
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,980
I was born in order to protect this world

301
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,770
ya bure ka bure omoikkiri

302
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,770
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! Give it all your best

303
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,150
yarunda furu pawaa

304
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,150
I'm using my full power

305
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,150
kibou ga ore no buki dakara

306
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,150
because hope is my weapon

307
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,820
mirai shinjite

308
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,820
So believe in the future!

309
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,130
Hey, I'm Goku!

310
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,820
You were off by one day?!

311
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,620
Then I won't make it in time at the Saiyan's arrival, Kaio-sama!

312
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,920
What's with this Ki?

313
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,950
Have they finally arrived?!

314
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,540
Next time on Dragon Ball Kai,

315
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,540
Come forth, Shenlong!

316
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,830
The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth!

317
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,670
I'll finally be able to see you again, mommy.

1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,720
Gohan desperately endures
Piccolo's style of arduous training.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,930
Tenshinhan and the others
had finished their training

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,970
in the Heavenly Realm, and had all
descended back to the lower realm,

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,350
each to prepare for the
conflict in their own way.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,480
And as for Goku,

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,730
he was learning the Kaio-ken
technique directly from Kaio

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,700
at a surprisingly fast rate.

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,410
Two days remain until the Saiyans arrive!

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,580
What will the outcome of their training be?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,920
Dokkan Dokkan tsuite'ru

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,090
Dokkan Dokkan paradise

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,220

Dragon Soul!

27
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:13,050
"Come Forth, Shen Long!
The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth."

28
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,980
This will be your final day of training with me.

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,570
Your punning studies may
have come up a little short,

30
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,950
but for the most part,
I've taught you what I know.

31
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,540
Let's review what you've learned up to now.

32
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,500
Mm-hmm.

33
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,670
First up is Bubbles.

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,640
Ready...

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,180
Start!

36
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,020
Oh! 0.8 seconds!That's a new record!

37
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,150
Next, Gregory.

38
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,690
Right.

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
Ready... Start!

40
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,250
Okay... here goes!

41
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,840
Huh? Ow!

42
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,340
1.2 seconds.

43
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,050
Unbelievable!

44
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,560
Okay, next?

45
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,310
All right, finally, let's check your Genki Dama.

46
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,390
I've been waiting for this.

47
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,990
All right, ready, Kaio-sama.

48
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,540
Mm-hmm. Okay, here we go.

49
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,050
See if you can track the
super speed of this giant brick.

50
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,670
Mm-hmm!

51
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,180
Here goes!

52
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,570
Okay, super speed!

53
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,650
Like it was nothing...

54
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,530
Well done, Son Goku. I honestly
didn't think you would be able

55
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,570
to handle the Genki Dama this well.

56
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,110
I worked hard on it.

57
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,160
Mm-hmm. It may sound like
I keep repeating myself,

58
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,700
but the Genki Dama is a technique

59
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,710
that lets you take a small sliver of energy

60
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,170
from the grass, the trees, people, animals,

61
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,420
and every other conceivable thing,
including the air itself,

62
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,930
gather it together, and then release it.

63
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,310
Mm-hmm. It really is an awesome technique.

64
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,810
Even on a planet as small as this,

65
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,730
the Genki Dama had that
much destructive force.

66
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:43,070
Earth, where you'll be fighting,
is much larger, compared to here.

67
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,240
Also, you'll have the tremendous
energy of the Sun on your side.

68
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,080
Your Genki Dama will have astounding power.

69
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,450
If you're not careful,

70
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,990
you could even destroy the very
planet you're trying to protect.

71
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,790
If you can help it, don't use it.

72
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,170
If, and only if there's nothing else you can do,

73
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,050
I give you permission to
use it just once. Got it?

74
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,720
Mm-hmm, got it.

75
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,970
I'm sure I'll be able to manage
with just the Kaio-ken.

76
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,850
Okay then, the day of your
battle is almost upon us.

77
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,100
The Saiyans will arrive on Earth tomorrow.

78
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,860
Huh?! O-Oh, no!

79
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,400
W-What? What's the matter?

80
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,360
Uh, listen, I didn't calculate
the time it will take you to travel

81
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,700
the Serpentine Road to get back!

82
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,790
K-Kaio-sama, ain't you capable of

83
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,620
whooshing me back to the lower realm?!

84
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,790
No, uh, I can't.

85
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,920
I-I've got to go back down that road?!

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,260
It took me over half a year to get here!

87
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,470
A-As you are now, you can
arrive there in two days.

88
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,260
I'll tell Earth's Kami to pick you up there.

89
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,220
B-But I'll still be one day over!
Everyone will be killed!

90
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,600
Stop your griping! Even I make
mistakes once in a while!

91
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,900
Now, hurry up and tell your friends on Earth

92
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,610
to use their Dragon Balls or
whatever to bring you back to life!

93
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,200
T-Tell them? But how?

94
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,580
Place your hand on my back,
and speak in your mind.

95
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,330
It will get through that way.

96
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,960
Really?

97
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:22,830
Like this?

98
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,420
Mm-hmm, like that. Hurry and tell them!

99
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,850
O-Old Timer, it's Goku. Can you
hear my voice? Hey, Old Timer!

100
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,440
Man, this girl is downright...

101
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,650
G-Goku? Is that you, Goku?
W-Where are you?!Where are you?!

102
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,040
He hears me! Old Man Turtle Hermit,
I'm still in the Next World.

103
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,450
I'm speaking to you through my mind

104
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,540
from a faraway place called Kaio's World.

105
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,710
T-The Next World?

106
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,130
Have you gotten all of
the Dragon Balls together?

107
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,130
Y-Yeah. We've long since gathered them.

108
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,390
Everyone looked frantically for
them so we could rescue you.

109
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,770
Thanks. So then, I hate to ask,
but could you summon Shen Long,

110
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,810
and bring me back to life right now?

111
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,980
The Saiyans will be getting to Earth tomorrow.

112
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,110
W-What?!

113
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,740
T-Tomorrow, already? That's a whole
month earlier than we thought!

114
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,740
Hurry, Old Timer.
I'll be just a little bit late,

115
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,250
but I'll definitely manage something.

116
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,370
Hey, Goku...!

117
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,750
Er, I can't breathe!

118
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,420
Ah! Sorry!

119
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,800
A-All right, got it. By the way,
Goku, what do you say?

120
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,510
We'd heard that you were
training in the Next World.

121
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,350
Any luck with that?

122
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,230
Mm-hmm, you bet!

123
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,650
I-I see. That's a relief.

124
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,230
H-Hey, is he all right?

125
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,450
Old Man Turtle Hermit is talking
to himself in the bathroom.

126
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,660
I wonder if he's going dotty.

127
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,700
Hey, get the Dragon Balls ready, right now!

128
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,010
That was awesome, Kaio-sama!
I got right through to him!

129
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,260
Naturally.

130
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,180
I can finally come back to life!

131
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,890
All right then, while we're waiting
for you to come back to life,

132
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,770
let me do something about that
heavy, ragged outfit of yours.

133
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,190
Eh? Really?

134
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,820
Watch.

135
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,530
Awesome! It's lighter!

136
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,750
It's not just lighter. It's made out
of a wonderfully sturdy fabric.

137
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,540
It can even repel minor attacks.

138
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,500
Thank you, Kaio-sama!

139
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,750
Wow, terrific!You left the
"Turtle" mark where it was!

140
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,760
I was worried that if I had
clothes like yours, Kaio-sama,

141
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,090
I wouldn't look very cool.

142
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,430
Well, excuse me.

143
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,140
Ah, I hope they bring me back to life soon!

144
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,360
The mark on the back is the
snazziest point on it, huh?

145
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,110
Hmm? Yeah!

146
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,670
What's wrong? You can't defeat
the enemy by just dodging him!

147
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,140
All right!

148
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,160
Whoops, I got carried away.
Was that a bit too strong?

149
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,040
That was no fair. You said you
weren't going to use your eyes.

150
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,500
Don't be such a baby!

151
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,590
Do you think a promise like that
means anything in a fight?!

152
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,470
B-But Piccolo-san, you're not the enemy.

153
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,180
Now, come forth, Shen Long!

154
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,970
It's the middle of the day,
but it's suddenly dark out.

155
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,110
E-Excuse me, here...

156
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,490
Don't touch me!

157
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,110
N-No matter how many times
I see it, it's still scary.

158
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,430
Speak your wish. I shall grant any one wish.

159
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,640
S-Say, um, I suppose we
couldn't say we wanted him

160
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,940
to dispatch the Saiyans,
and save the Earth, could we?

161
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,320
What are you talking about? Are you
thinking of keeping Son-kun dead?

162
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,860
I-It's not like that. It would be nice and easy

163
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,530
to just have Goku brought back
to life the next time, right?

164
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,500
That is an impossible wish.
I was created by Kami.

165
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,710
As such, I cannot grant any
wish beyond Kami's power.

166
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,840
Well then, please bring Son Goku back to life.

167
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,090
That is an easy wish to grant.

168
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,240
Son Goku is about to be resurrected, huh?

169
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,460
Which means, the Saiyans will be
coming sooner than we thought!

170
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,170
All right, the halo over
your head has disappeared.

171
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,590
You have been brought back to life!

172
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,930
Hooray!

173
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,350
--Go on, hurry!
--Right!

174
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,180
Remember, your enemies are evil men,

175
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,020
more powerful than you can imagine!

176
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,640
They won't let you drop
your guard for an instant!

177
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,610
Don't go thinking you can be
brought back to life again!

178
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,150
That's all right. The Dragon Balls
can only bring you back to life once.

179
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,490
I'll give them everything
I've got!Just you watch!

180
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,030
Mm-hmm.

181
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,580
Thanks for everything, Kaio-sama!

182
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,870
Once I die, I'll come see you again!

183
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,540
Bubbles!

184
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,540
--Gregory!
--Take care!

185
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,170
Bye, now!

186
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,310
Bye!

187
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,580
What unfathomable strength that man has.

188
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,290
And yet his heart is even clearer than crystal.

189
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,420
To think that there would be
someone like him in the lower realm.

190
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,130
Kaio-sama, he has become
even stronger than you, huh?

191
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,180
Still, his sense of humor wasn't that great.

192
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,100
The next time he comes here,
I'll train him on that.

193
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,350
Oh, hush, you. Just hush.

194
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,700
Wow, so light, so light!

195
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,660
My body feels as light as a cotton ball!

196
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,120
Oh, right!

197
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,670
This ain't no time to be thrilled.
I have to hurry!

198
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,510
And so, the next day at 11:43 AM...

199
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:45,690
...Earth at last allows the two
Saiyans to trespass upon her.

200
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,550
Papa, I'm hungry.

201
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,970
Oh, is it already this late?

202
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,010
W-What was that?

203
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,310
What happened?

204
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,360
T-This is stunning...

205
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,940
It looks like something fell from the sky.

206
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,580
S-Sure enough. That round
thing fell out of the sky.

207
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,210
There's one over here, too.

208
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,440
It's a person!

209
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,440
A person came out of it!

210
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,320
Over here, too!

211
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,320
It's a person!

212
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,360
W-What...?

213
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,590
So, the Saiyans are finally here.

214
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,510
They have an incredible Ki, huh, Piccolo-san?

215
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,150
T-Ten-san...

216
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,480
Tch, that was a lot sooner than we thought.

217
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,990
It's just about time for the Saiyans to arrive.

218
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,650
Hurry!

219
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,490
Guys, hold out for me!

220
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,240
The dreadful day has finally arrived.

What is this? I'm getting
a bad feeling about this.

238
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,030
Whoa, there's something
coming out of the ground!

239
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,650
T-They're called Saibaimen?

240
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,490
They're a repulsive bunch.

241
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,120
Son Goku isn't here yet, but
there are six of us here now.

242
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,580
We'll take care of these guys by turns!

243
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

244
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,080
"Yamucha's Struggle!The Terrible Saibaimen."

245
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,880
Yamucha-san, be careful!

1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,940
The strongest of the Saiya-jin have arrived on Earth.

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,220
Meanwhile, Goku, who has been training for the battle,

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,950
had been brought back to life by Shen Long.

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,400
However, his return to Earth will be a day late.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,880
Will Goku be able to make it in time?

Yamucha's Struggle!

The Terrifying Saibaimen!

18
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,240
Yamucha's Struggle!

19
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,750
The Terrifying Saibaimen!

20
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,080
W-Who are those guys?

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,320
Who are they?

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,450
So this is Earth?

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,080
Not too shabby of a planet.

24
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,750
Maybe I should greet these chirping chicks.

25
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,780
Go easy on them.

26
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,760
Wh-What the...?!

27
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,660
Wh-What the hell did those guys do?!

28
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,670
I-It hurts!

29
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,670
H-Holy crap!

30
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,940
Maybe that was a bit too warm of a greeting.

31
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,220
That's enough, Nappa.

32
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,170
We won't be able to sell this planet for a high price if you show off too much.

33
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,220
R-Right. Anyway, weren't we supposed to look for those what's-their-name-balls that make any wish come true?

34
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,350
The Dragon Balls.

35
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,360
But first, shouldn't we look for the guy who killed Raditz and then get the whereabouts of the Dragon Balls from him?

36
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,200
You're right.

37
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,320
But if the Dragon Balls were around here,

38
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,410
then our wish of eternal life is gone with the wind.

39
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,690
And that would be all because of your idiotic greeting.

40
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,540
I-I'm sorry. I guess I wasn't thinking.

41
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,830
Well, what's done is done.

42
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,550
Regardless, we'll look for the guy with the highest battle power.

43
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,970
He should be the one who killed Raditz.

44
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,410
Strange.

45
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,440
There's not just one or two readings of people with a battle power of over 1,000.

46
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,840
How can that be the case on a planet like this?

47
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,470
Don't lose your cool. After all, they're not our enemies.

48
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,070
Anyway, seek out the one with the highest battle power.

49
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,540
I found him!

50
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,480
There's two of them together and they're both freakin' high.

51
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,710
Alright, Nappa. Let's go and play with them!

52
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,640
As such, the cause of this huge earthquake is completely unknown.

53
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,640
Furthermore, many are worried about the safety of the citizens of Eastern Capital,

54
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,110
which is thought to be the epicenter of this earthquake.

55
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,110
Th-They're here at last!

56
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,390
Should we go help them? We'll know where they are with this.

57
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,370
I-I-I-I don't wanna die, so I'm not going!

58
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,660
I-I'll go!

59
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,580
I think that Yamucha-sama will undoubtedly go there, too.

60
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,010
No, let's not.

61
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,020
They're on a whole 'nother level.

62
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,450
We'll just be be in the way if we go there.

63
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,840
There's nothing else we can do but hope that everyone wins.

64
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,850
Son-kun, hurry back!

65
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,260
Come back soon!

66
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,250
You gotta keep at it till I get there, guys!

67
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,710
This is great.

68
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,410
This Planet Earth hardly has any gravity at all. I can move more freely.

69
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,460
They're moving with incredible speed.

70
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,630
They're heading straight for two other big ki sources.

71
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,800
They are coming! Those guys are coming straight here.

72
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,890
Right.

73
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,100
Chaozu! You'll stay behind!

74
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,890
No way! I'm coming, too!

75
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,400
There is nothing to be afraid of.

76
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,560
We are stronger than we were a year ago.

77
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,570
R-Right!

78
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,280
There is something approaching from another direction.

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,270
And even more from other directions!

80
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,800
Are there more than two of the Saiya-jin?!

81
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,040
A Saiya-jin?!

82
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,040
Hey, long time no see, Piccolo.

83
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,710
Oh, it is just you.

84
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,840
What the hell are you doing here? You came here knowing you would be in the way?

85
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,180
It seems there are more fools coming to accompany us.

86
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,680
Yeah, everyone'll come for sure.
I was just the one closest to here.

87
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,690
I remember now. You were at Kame Sennin-sama's place.

88
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,610
Yeah, I'm Kuririn.

89
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,410
You've become really strong, haven't you?

90
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,300
You look exactly like Goku when he was a kid.

91
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,940
You're small, but strong, right? Father often said that!

92
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,460
You're going to fight alongside us, right?

93
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,410
Did Goku really say that?

94
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,580
The chit-chat ends there. They have arrived!

95
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,170
There he is.

96
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,260
Looks like it's gone from one shrimp to three strong-looking shrimps.

97
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,310
Either way, let us thoroughly introduce ourselves to them.

98
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,350
It looks like you've been waiting for us.

99
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,200
That is correct.

100
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:08,530
Just to verify, what the hell is your reason for coming here?

101
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,850
That voice... I see.

102
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,300
You're the one who killed Raditz, right?

103
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,340
Voice?

104
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,900
Didn't Raditz tell you?

105
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,850
This here is a communication device, too.

106
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,960
He's a Namekian.

107
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,340
Looks like it.

108
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,360
Then it's no wonder he managed to kill Raditz.

109
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,490
Namekian?

110
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:39,450
Namekians appear to be in possession of mysterious abilities, in addition to their extraordinary battle power.

111
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,920
I-I am a Namekian?

112
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,140
Also, I've heard about ones that are able to perform things like magic.

113
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,670
Now I get it.

114
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,930
The creator of those Dragon Balls,

115
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,220
it must be you.

116
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,100
Y-You even know about the Dragon Balls?!

117
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,830
Those Dragon Balls are our primary objective.

118
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,620
We'll have you quietly hand them over to us.

119
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,400
It doesn't matter how many Namekian there are because they're all just like flies to us.

120
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,750
Thank you.

121
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,240
Thanks to you, I somehow know something about my ancestors now.

122
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,490
However, unfortunately for you,

123
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,830
I am not the creator of the Dragon Balls.

124
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,900
My field of study is... the study of fighting.

125
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,920
Why don't you come see if I'm like a fly?

126
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,660
God...

127
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,650
I-I never would have imagined that I was an alien.

128
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,730
It's no wonder why I thought I was a bit different from everyone else.

129
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,110
The creator of the Dragon Balls is indeed me.

130
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,400
But when I first made them, it felt strangely nostalgic.

131
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:08,740
Perhaps someone on this "Namek" planet created something similar to the Dragon Balls.

132
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,420
Nappa, take off your scouter.

133
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:13,880
What?

134
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,860
These guys change their battle power accordingly to a battle.

135
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,110
These numbers are just unreliable.

136
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,170
Yeah, you're right.

137
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:30,940
That weak fool, Raditz, dropped his guard and got himself killed for relying solely on his scouter's numbers.

138
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,900
R-Raditz? Isn't that the Saiya-jin it took you and Goku working together to ultimately defeat?

139
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,740
He was weak?

140
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,430
That's right. Why don't we see these guys in action?

141
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,770
Hey, Nappa... there are six Saibaimen left, right?

142
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,750
Take 'em out.

143
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,840
Vegeta, so you like to play games too, huh?

144
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,880
S-Saibaimen?

145
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,340
W-What are those?

146
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,470
There's six, all right.

147
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,490
There'll be some good Saibamen from this soil.

148
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,140
Wh-What is this?

149
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,650
Okay.

150
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,900
T-T-Those guys give me the creeps!

151
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,150
Your targets are those three. Let them feel pain, Saibaimen.

152
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,580
Not for sale, rent, eBay, or profit of any kind.

153
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,580
If you paid for this you were ripped off!

154
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,190
Gohan, do not hesitate!

155
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,010
Right!

156
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,980
Is it our turn now?

157
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,000
Kuririn!

158
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,010
Tenshinhan! You came too, Chaozu?

159
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,260
Yep.

160
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,140
Weren't there supposed to be only two Saiya-jin?

161
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,350
Well, a lot of things happened. There's more now.

162
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,740
It doesn't matter how many there are.

163
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,440
Is that Goku's kid?

164
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,190
Yeah, it looks like he's been thoroughly trained by Piccolo.

165
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,830
Kuririn, sorry for being late.

166
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,280
Yamucha-san!

167
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,870
We're all present now, except for Goku.

168
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,880
One, two, three, four, five, six...

169
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,220
How amusing. Exactly the same number of Saibaimen.

170
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,220
How about it? Why don't you take turns going at them one-on-one?

171
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,020
It'll be a game.

172
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,310
A game? Bullshit!

173
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,020
Stop with the roundabouts and let us settle this at once!

174
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,610
Hey, come on. It'll be favorable for us.

175
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,380
Goku isn't here yet, you know.

176
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,820
Fine by me.

177
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,060
I'll go first.

178
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,830
Well, come on then.

179
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,030
He wouldn't be so cocky if he knew how strong the Saibaimen are.

180
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,870
You'll go first. Beat him with everything you have, got it?

181
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,780
Gohan!

182
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,020
He did it!

183
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,790
As expected from Tenshinhan!

184
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,750
Amazing.

185
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,740
I-Impossible! The Saibaimen have a battle power of 1,200!

186
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,310
They're equal to Raditz when it comes to power alone.

187
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,310
It looks like this guy's battle power exceeds that.

188
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,090
B-But...

189
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,230
It's simple math.

190
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,320
But such data is...

191
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,320
Nappa, regardless, it seems like these guys will entertain us for a while.

192
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,550
V-Vegeta, why did you...?

193
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,000
That Saibaiman was completely beaten by him.

194
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,010
I thought I told him to go all-out.

195
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,520
What a guy.

196
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,150
Th-That Saiya-jin ripped that monster apart in an instant.

197
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,360
What power...

198
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,030
Well, who's next then?

199
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,610
O-Okay, I'll go!

200
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,940
Hold on, Kuririn.

201
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,950
Yamucha-san?

202
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,080
I want to give them a run for their money.

203
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,080
Yamucha-san, I can...

204
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,040
You've been brought back to life with the Dragon Balls once already.

205
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,920
If something were to happen to you, then we wouldn't be able to bring you back a second time.

206
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,390
Leave this to me.

207
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,890
I'll take care of the remaining five in a single strike.

208
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,510
What a wonderful friendship.

209
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,930
Okay, you go.

210
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,270
Now, come then! Don't take us lightly!

211
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,230
What's this strange premonition I've got?

212
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,820
This is bad!

213
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,630
Piccolo, you gotta somehow hold out till I get there. I'm countin' on you!

214
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,730
Th-They vanished.

215
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,600
Fool! They are moving at high speed. Try sensing the movement of their ki!

216
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,710
The movement of their ki?

217
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,470
Everyone except you is capable of seeing them.

218
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,180
Really? Everyone can?

219
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,930
All right!

220
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,670
Look with your entire body.

221
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,850
With my entire body...

222
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,370
Can you see them?

223
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,880
I can see them!

224
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,400
Get back here!

225
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,460
All right!

226
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,300
A-Amazing.

227
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,830
He did it!

228
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,540
The earthling prevailed!

229
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:38,130
All right! All right, all right, all right!

230
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,650
Again?!

231
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,070
It seems like these monsters aren't as strong as you guys thought.

232
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,950
Wh-What was that?!

233
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,160
Keep your shirt on, Nappa!

234
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,040
I'll take care of the remaining four, too.

235
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,880
This time, it looks like it's you who've been taking the Saibaimen lightly.

236
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,210
What?!

237
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,320
Shit!

238
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,070
H-How?

239
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,450
Yamucha!

240
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,920
Yes, that's good.

241
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,590
Wh-What a guy! He self-destructed!

242
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,430
H-How terrible...

243
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,890
H-He's dead.

244
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:25,950
Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

245
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:33,950
Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

246
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,090
Yamucha-sama!

247
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,560
Yamucha-san had a bad feeling about this all along.

248
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,630
Y-Yet, instead of me...

249
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,910
Damn it all...

250
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,220
Damn it all!

251
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,520
What am I gonna tell Puer and Bulma-san?!

252
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,820
Pathetic! It suicided on him!

253
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,380
What the hell did he think he was doing against trash like that?!

254
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,670
Hey, it's filthy now, so how about you clean up the trash?

255
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,910
You asshole!

256
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,420
Everyone, get back!

257
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,500
Yamucha-san, I'll take them on for you and I'll be sure not to fail.

258
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,490
I'll show you the results of my training!

259
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,980
Suddenly, Yamucha had been killed.

260
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:43,390
Now, Kuririn prepares to unleash his fury. What are the results of his training?

261
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,040
Yo! It's me, Goku!

262
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,530
Everyone, try hangin' in there a bit longer!

263
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,600
What are you thinking, Chaozu?! Don't do something so stupid!

264
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,860
C-Chaozu-san!

265
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,600
Chaozu, I won't let you be lonely!

266
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,360
Take this, Saiya-jin! This is my final technique!

267
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,690
Next time, on Dragon Ball Kai:

268
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,700
Wait, Chaozu!

269
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,830
Wait, Chaozu!
Tenshinhan's Screaming Kikouhou.

270
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,400
Tenshinhan's Screaming Kikouhou.

271
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,930
Please, get here soon, Father!


1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,820
It looked as though Yamucha had triumphed over a Saibaiman.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,570
However...

3
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,100
Hey, it's filthy now, so how about you clean up the trash?

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,480
Now, Kuririn prepares to unleash his explosive fury.

Tenshinhan's Screaming Kikouhou

17
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:13,120
Wait, Chaozu! Tenshinhan's Screaming Kikouhou!

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,290
I'll show you the results of my training!

19
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,420
Go.

20
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,970
What's with that sluggish sphere?

21
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,450
He did it!

22
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,620
Wow, how amazing!

23
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,500
Kuririn, you okay?

24
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,020
Yeah, but I missed one.

25
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,510
Go to Hell!

26
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,530
Nothing less from Piccolo.

27
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,280
I shudder at the thought of him becoming our enemy in the future.

28
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,190
Thank you, Piccolo-san.

29
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,330
Do not misunderstand. Please, like I would save you.

30
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,710
I was just warming up for the magnificent battle from here on out.

31
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,540
I wonder how magnificent that battle will really be.

32
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,530
Then, just as you have wanted,

33
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,400
shall we end the games here?

34
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,700
Now it's the real deal.

35
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,200
I-Impossible! There's not a single scratch on them!

36
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,530
I-I used my full power!

37
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,540
So this is a Saiya-jin?

38
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,840
Let me be the one to do it.

39
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,840
I'll put an end to these five in an instant.

40
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,340
Then do what you'd like.

41
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,180
However, leave the Namekian alive.

42
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,810
We won't be able to get any info on the Dragon Balls later on if he dies.

43
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,180
Now then, entertain me as much as you can.

44
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,170
To begin with...

45
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,670
I'll start with you!

46
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,070
Leave him to me!

47
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
Piccolo-san!

48
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,990
Seems like you'll entertain me for a bit.

49
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,350
Wh-What?!

50
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,200
Th-the ground is shaking.

51
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,660
I-It's no use, Ten-san!

52
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,050
My psychic powers aren't working!

53
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,760
N-No way.

54
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,020
H-How can it be th-this much?!

55
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,470
I have to hurry! Hold on, everyone!

56
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,010
Okay!

57
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,140
Chaozu, be careful!

58
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,040
Tenshinhan!

59
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,670
Get away!

60
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
Ten-san!

61
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,100
How very brittle they are.

62
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,750
This is the end!

63
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,340
Scumbag!

64
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,300
Tenshinhan-san!

65
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,370
Damn it! Tenshinhan!

66
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,770
Wait! He's already done for. Leave him be!

67
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,890
Shut up!

68
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,640
Piss off!

69
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,510
A bottomless pit! I cannot believe it!

70
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,960
What an ungodly wave of energy.

71
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,590
D-Damn it!

72
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,510
Nappa, watch your back!

73
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,270
Chaozu!

74
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,730
Why, you little...!

75
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,190
Chaozu, get off of him!

76
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,710
Chaozu! Get off of him already!

77
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,390
T-Ten-san...

78
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,830
Th-Thank you.

79
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,170
W-What are you saying, Chaozu?

80
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,290
Get away! Hurry up and get away!

81
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:46,060
It was fun being together with you.

82
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,360
Chaozu, what the hell are you thinking about doing?!

83
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,750
Farewell, Ten-san. Please don't die!

84
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,920
Don't do it, Chaozu!

85
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,420
Ten-san!

86
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,110
Chaozu!

87
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,800
He decided to blow himself up with the other guy.

88
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,340
That midget did a good job.

89
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,980
What a worthless thing to do.

90
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,150
N-No way. It didn't even scratch him...

91
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,190
Oh, God!

92
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,160
Even though Chaozu sacrificed his life.

93
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,290
Chaozu's b-been revived once already with the Dragon Balls.

94
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,820
He can't be revived a second time!

95
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,080
Damn it! I'll make you pay!

96
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,630
It seems like you still don't understand just how dreadful we truly are.

97
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,620
Nothing but death awaits you!

98
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,360
Not for sale, rent, eBay, or profit of any kind.

99
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,360
If you paid for this you were ripped off!

100
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,670
I-It didn't hurt him at all.

101
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,920
Chaozu's sacrifice was for nothing!

102
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,300
Chaozu!

103
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,810
I'll also send you to the Afterlife in a moment, so be grateful.

104
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,840
Y-You'll pay.

105
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,820
You'll pay for sure!

106
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,300
A-At this rate, Tenshinhan-san will die, too.

107
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,810
I have to do something!

108
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,560
Hold it!

109
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,770
We will have our chance the moment he moves in for an attack.

110
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,570
We will wait for that moment.

111
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,360
Got it, Gohan?

112
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,360
O-Okay.

113
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,490
Good strategy. I hope for a good fight.

114
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,160
Shouldn't you be looking over there?

115
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,960
You'll miss your chance.

116
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,950
I can afford it.

117
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,500
Although, I wonder if you will have that dumb look on your face once Son Goku arrives.

118
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,260
And who might that be? Your backup?

119
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,260
Look forward to meeting him.

120
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,900
It seems like this is your limit, huh?

121
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,360
I'll put you to sleep soon.

122
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,000
Go to Hell!

123
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,040
Now's our chance! Kuririn! Gohan!

124
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:24,770
Right!

125
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,110
This is the end! Die!

126
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,780
What?!

127
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,150
Gohan! Blast him now!

128
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,110
Gohan!

129
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,510
Hurry up!

130
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,590
I-I'm scared!

131
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,670
You damn brat!

132
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,050
It's no use!

133
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,850
We missed! The timing was off.

134
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,550
Well, didn't that go well? You bastards just shortened your lifespan further.

135
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,070
That's fine though, because now I've decided to change the order I'll kill you in.

136
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,950
Prepare yourselves!

137
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,370
P-Please forgive me, Mister Piccolo.

138
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,710
What's the matter, God?

139
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,080
It looks like I'll only be alive for a little while longer.

140
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,720
Death. Death is drawing near.

141
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,270
You don't mean... no way.

142
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,580
Piccolo is going to get killed.

143
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,120
Everyone else will die, too.

144
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,220
A-And Goku?

145
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,630
I still don't sense him coming.

146
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,650
Goku, hurry!

147
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,910
Ch-Chaozu...

148
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,740
We always fought together,

149
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,420
and now you're gone for good!

150
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,420
Ten-san, forgive me.

151
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,210
Chaozu!

152
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,140
Only retards would get me angry.

153
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,170
Now, who should I play with first?

154
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:56,160
I'll only let that Namekian live by a hair's breadth.

155
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,450
We need to know more about the Dragon Balls, right?

156
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,140
Chaozu, I'll attack the enemy, and then I'll be with you!

157
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll never let you be lonely.

158
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,030
This... This is my final...

159
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,490
K-Kikouhou!

160
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,200
Did he do it?!

161
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,180
That had me scared shitless.

162
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,630
We can't hurt him at all.

163
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,890
Is that monster indestructible?!

164
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,930
How regrettable.

165
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,700
Fool.

166
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,670
He exhausted himself when he should have just laid there quietly and slept, and thus, died in vain.

167
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,160
N-No way. Even Tenshinhan was...

168
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,650
What a nightmare. Everyone's dying one after another.

169
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,350
Goku! Hurry up and get here already!

170
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,450
Goku!

171
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,510
Hurry! Hurry!

172
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,300
Goku?

173
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,680
The name from before, but who...

174
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,240
Wait a minute.

175
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,360
That's another one taken care of.

176
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,250
Now it's your turn.

177
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,520
Let's fight on ground level.

178
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,250
This guy far surpasses us at fighting in the air.

179
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,960
It doesn't matter what you do.

180
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,630
Struggle while you can.

181
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,470
Here I go!

182
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,760
He's here!

183
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,740
Father!

184
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,430
Nappa! Wait!

185
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,230
W-What?! Why won't you let me?!

186
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,440
Keep your pants on. I have a little question for them.

187
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,010
When you say Son Goku, are you referring to Kakarotto?

188
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,490
Yeah, so what of it?!

189
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,160
So your only hope is that Kakarotto?

190
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,470
He didn't even stand a chance against Raditz.

191
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,130
What good would he be even if he did come?

192
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,820
It's different now!

193
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,670
He's become much, much stronger now!

194
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,790
Do not make light of Son Goku!

195
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,660
It looks as though he won't be coming here any time soon, right?

196
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,100
Maybe he got scared and ran away, huh?

197
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,110
H-He'll come! Father will be here for sure!

198
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,250
He'll beat you guys up!

199
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,270
So much faith.

200
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,170
How amusing.

201
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,120
We'll wait for him to get here.

202
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,950
Are you kidding? I can finish these guys off in a second.

203
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,500
However, we'll only wait for three hours. Any longer than that and we can forget it.

204
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,860
This is retarded! I'm gonna have fun right now!

205
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,040
Nappa! Are you deaf or something?!

206
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,510
S-Sorry. I was just on a roll.

207
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,280
And that's how it is.

208
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,850
Your lifespan has been extended for a while. Be grateful.

209
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,710
I don't blame him. It's his first fight, after all.

210
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,130
It was pathetic of me to expect something of you.

211
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,540
Leave, you coward.

212
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,670
With that aside, I noticed how scared that big guy was.

213
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,550
Does that mean the small one, Vegeta, is really that outrageously strong?

214
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,530
I'm itching to do something. I can't wait any longer!

215
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,890
Just wait. It's only three hours.

216
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,740
Once those three hours are up, we can show them Hell.

217
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:44,130
The battle resumes in three hours. Will you make it in time, Goku?!

218
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,980
Yo! It's me, Goku!

219
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,590
Okay, I'm finally at the end of Snake Road.

220
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,260
There ain't much more 'til I reach everyone!

221
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,640
However, we are already at our limit.

222
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,320
We have no choice but to hold out until Goku gets here.

223
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,020
I can sense Father's Ki. He came, after all.

224
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,080
Next time, on Dragon Ball Kai:

225
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,860
Will Son Goku make it in time?!
The battle resumes in three hours!

226
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,820
Will Son Goku make it in time?!

227
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,820
The battle resumes in three hours!

228
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,090
P-Piccolo-san... why?

1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,360
Chaozu paid the ultimate price.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,090
Kikouhou!

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,620
I failed.

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,180
Tenshinhan soon joined him.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,800
Nappa!

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,040
The battle resumes in three hours. Hurry, Goku!

Will Son Goku Make it in Time?!

18
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:14,940
The Battle Resumes in Three Hours!

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,090
Will Son Goku Make it in Time?! The Battle Resumes in Three Hours!

20
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,780
Why do we have to wait for someone like Kakarotto?

21
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,970
Because he's a traitor to us and to all Saiya-jin.

22
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,620
It's our duty to hand down punishment to traitors.

23
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,440
We'll kill his son and friends right before his eyes.

24
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,780
And after that, we'll thoroughly fry him, as well.

25
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,320
We'll torment the buffoon until he realizes how helpless he is.

26
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,070
And then, after three or four hours...

27
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,090
We should be able to give him a wonderful show from Hell.

28
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,800
Ah, so that's how it is. Awesome!

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,390
That is if he is here in three hours.

30
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,860
I'll let you handle Kakarotto, but let me take care of the other three.

31
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,350
Suit yourself, however...

32
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,520
Only after we've had the Namekian spit out what he knows about the Dragon Balls.

33
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,030
It'll be great if Kakarotto shows up.

34
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,170
Hey, if it's like this, why don't we make a run for it?

35
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,210
We have no chance of winning. This isn't a exactly a situation overcome by fighting spirit alone.

36
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,130
Fool! Those guys are planning to annihilate mankind regardless of that.

37
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,680
It would not make a difference if we ran away now.

38
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,450
D-Damn it.

39
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,410
I'm begging you, Goku! Please show up!

40
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,400
Please show us that you're much, much stronger than those guys!

41
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,440
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

42
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,690
Not yet.

43
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,990
Everyone, please hang in there a little more.

44
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,750
Piccolo, Goku will be here in three hours for sure, right?

45
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,960
Who knows?

46
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,920
Until he arrives, we will have to think of a way to damage them, even if it is only a little.

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,970
P-Piccolo-san!

48
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,800
P-Please train me again for three more hours.

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Do not get sentimental!

50
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,440
I have no business with cowards. Hurry up and go home.

51
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,060
P-Piccolo-san.

52
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,400
Piccolo!

53
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,450
I have taught you everything I know. There is nothing more I can teach you.

54
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,700
Gohan, come back! Gohan!

55
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,960
Hey, kid. You thinking about running away?

56
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,520
Well, that's really smart of ya.

57
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,130
Who would I be running away from?!

58
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,430
Your mom has...

59
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,280
an outie!

60
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,660
That brat...!

61
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,310
H-How did he know?!

62
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,650
My mom does have an outie!

63
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,360
I-I think we'll try to get as close to the scene as we can.

64
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,690
Just what on Earth is going on?

65
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,830
We don't know the details, but could it be that it's a timeout or something?

66
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,180
I think I'll go play for a bit.

67
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,210
I just can't sit tight in a place like this for three hours.

68
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,340
Do what you'd like, although...

69
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,220
Don't show off too much, Nappa.

70
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,400
Why?

71
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,710
There'll be a show from Hell in about three hours, after all.

72
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,350
You're right about that, Vegeta.

73
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,150
I'm only gonna greet'em, so chill out.

74
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,990
One of the Saiya-jin have taken to the skies!

75
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,530
Where could he possibly be going?

76
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,680
S-Somehow, it looks as though he is rapidly approaching our position!

77
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,420
H-He's giving chase!

78
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,080
Heads up!

79
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,890
Roll camera!

80
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,030
R-Run away!

81
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,950
Eyesores, disappear!

82
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,780
This is a bit of a sudden question, but has Goku not arrived there yet?

83
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:20,200
"Tsukanukoto" means "sudden question". "Tsukanu" means "not arrived".

84
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,200
This isn't the time to laugh at my gags, no matter how funny they are.

85
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,670
The fate of Earth is at stake here.

86
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,270
Make haste, Son Goku!

87
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,760
I can see it!

88
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,010
Just a little more!

89
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,890
Goku's presence!

90
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,980
Yes, his return is nearly at hand. He might make it in time.

91
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,010
One hour left, huh?

92
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,160
That Kakarotto, he better not get cold feet.

93
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,160
For better or for worse, it seems as though there is nothing else we can do.

94
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,010
He's here! Son Goku has arrived!

95
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,440
Hurry, God!

96
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,880
The end of Snake Road!

97
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,490
H-He's fast! That was splendidly quick.

98
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm sensin' two powerful ki sources.

99
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,060
What's goin' on?!

100
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:31,320
And with Goku not having turned up yet, the three hours have passed.

101
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,280
Time's up.

102
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,490
Damn it!

103
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,790
It looks as though waiting was all for nothing in the end.

104
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,580
He's still not here yet?

105
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,500
That coward Kakarotto hasn't arrived.

106
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,640
Father isn't some coward!

107
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,340
Shit, why won't he come?!

108
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,350
Son Goku...

109
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,540
Now then, why don't I beat the crap outta ya?

110
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,560
It's a shame that Kakarotto won't get to see this.

111
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,980
There is only one way we can possibly beat this guy.

112
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,580
Naturally, that is only if everything goes well.

113
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,660
Listen up.

114
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,400
First, Kuririn...

115
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,290
You will draw his attention so that we can set a trap.

116
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,620
Then, when I see my chance, I will grab his tail, which is a Saiya-jin weakness.

117
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,130
O-Okay.

118
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,240
Once he has lost his strength and can no longer move,

119
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,260
Gohan, hit him with all the power you can muster!

120
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,390
Okay! This time I won't run away or anything, so it'll be all right!

121
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:45,730
Of course. Keep in mind that the fate of the Earth is in your hands.

122
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,780
Gohan, believe in yourself.

123
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,160
If you set your mind to it, then your power will be greater than mine.

124
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,960
Okay...

125
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,250
Goku!

126
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,280
God!

127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,440
We're in a hurry, so grab on!

128
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,220
Countin' on ya!

129
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:23,640
Th-That youngster really came back here all the way from Kaiou-sama.

130
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,930
I gotta get goin' then! The trainin' was great!

131
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,980
We're counting on you.

132
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,390
Good luck, Goku.

133
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,150
'kay.

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,820
Everyone! Gohan! Please be alive!

135
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,780
He's here! Son Goku must be considerably tired.

136
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,370
Karin-sama!

137
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,630
Here are the last two magic beans, catch!

138
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,790
Thank you!

139
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,180
I owe ya.

140
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,670
We're counting on you!

141
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,600
One right now.

142
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,600
All right, I'm filling with energy! Kinto-Un!

143
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,150
It's been a while! I'm countin' on ya!

144
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,360
There's some incredible ki... over there!

145
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,840
Hell yeah!

146
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,380
Not for sale, rent, eBay, or profit of any kind.

147
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,380
If you paid for this you were ripped off!

148
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,970
Okay, here I go!

149
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,830
He's coming at me all of a sudden.

150
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,900
Divert his attention!

151
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,630
Now!

152
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,010
Y-You bastard!

153
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,290
Gohan!

154
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,840
You idiots!

155
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,200
I-Impossible.

156
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,710
P-Piccolo-san...

157
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,270
Whoa, don't die just yet, buddy.

158
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,030
You still haven't spilled the beans about those Dragon Balls yet, ya know?

159
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,410
N-N-No way...

160
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,700
That was an awful miscalculation.

161
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,590
Did you honestly believe we wouldn't overcome such a weakness?

162
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,410
Too bad for you.

163
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,920
The best fighter on this planet has been reduced to this with a single blow.

164
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,600
P-Piccolo-san! Get a grip on yourself!

165
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,270
Well, since he's takin' a nap,

166
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,300
maybe I should play with the little shrimp.

167
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,380
I think I'll begin with Kakarotto's son, then.

168
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,310
Hey, you too have the blood of a pure Saiya-jin.

169
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,840
Do ya think you'll entertain me for a while?

170
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,940
Hey, hey! Don't kick the bucket just yet.

171
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,810
Play with me some more.

172
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,370
That's the way I like it!

173
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,180
You son of a bitch!

174
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,800
At least his movement is excellent.

175
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,470
I'll show you my best.

176
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,970
Kienzan!

177
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,150
What a shitty technique.

178
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,460
Nappa, dodge it!

179
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,040
That fool! Did he not realize the potency of that technique?

180
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,970
Shit...!

181
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,660
A-Asshole!

182
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,820
How dare you? How dare you make a scar on my beautiful face?!

183
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,860
Turn to dust!

184
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,930
And here's the finale!

185
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,980
So you've woken up, huh?

186
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,310
D-Dickhead!

187
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,530
It looks like you're getting a run for your money, Nappa.

188
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,440
Don't you...

189
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,530
Don't you ever underestimate the Earth, Saiya-jin!

190
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,470
Y-You prick! Now I'm really pissed off!

191
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,820
The only reason I've gone easy on ya is because of those Dragon Balls!

192
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,540
You're pushing your luck!

193
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,880
You are the one pushing your luck here.

194
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,840
Wh-What is this ki?

195
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,140
T-There is a tremendous ki source approaching from afar!

196
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,920
I-It's true.

197
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,170
An awesome, but familiar ki!

198
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,690
T-There's no mistaking it... I-I can feel it.

199
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,510
This could only be...

200
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,740
Son Goku.

201
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,120
Only a little further, Goku. Hurry up!

202
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,420
It is Son Goku! Son Goku is coming at last!

203
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:56,550
W-We knew he would arrive! Damn that bastard for making us wait!

204
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,210
F-Father! Father is coming!

205
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,720
Hurry, hurry!

206
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,430
G-Goku...

207
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,430
These guys seem to have a mysterious ability that allows them to read presences.

208
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,590
Kakarotto, huh? Let's see.

209
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,150
I'm close now! I feel two big ki sources.

210
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,210
Two even bigger ki sources and one small one.

211
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,040
T-The numbers ain't addin' up! Did someone die?

212
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,890
Kinto-Un, please go faster!

213
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,080
Vegeta, is what these guys saying for real?

214
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,140
Is that actually Kakarotto who's heading this way?

215
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:57,500
I have no idea if it's Kakarotto, but in four minutes, this guy will arrive.

216
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,770
A guy with a battle power of about 5,000.

217
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,290
5-5,000?! A-Are you shitting me?!

218
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,130
Nappa! Kill those guys!

219
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,010
It's possible that if all four of them band together, we'll have our hands full!

220
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,210
We'll use it to set an example for Kakarotto.

221
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,210
What?!

222
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,970
B-But, what about the Dragon Balls?

223
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,510
Don't worry! I have a plan.

224
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:34,030
If we go to that Namekian's home planet, Namek, then we may find even greater Dragon Balls.

225
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:39,900
I thought of it as a stupid rumor, but if Kakarotto really has been revived,

226
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,070
then that legend should be true.

227
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,790
I get it now.

228
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,660
All right. Then, I'll start with this bastard!

229
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,580
P-Piccolo-san! Run away!

230
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,290
I'll try to hold them off until Father gets here!

231
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,170
What?

232
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:02,300
Because if you die, then God will die too, and the Dragon Balls will...

233
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,380
You are talking crap.

234
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,810
It is not like you can hold them back by yourself.

235
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,810
You're quite the comedian, you little shit!

236
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,670
Not good!

237
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,690
You brat...!

238
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,220
I've had enough of you!

239
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,700
N-Not good!

240
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,850
Die!

241
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,770
This was an unforeseen action.

242
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,270
What could've crossed Piccolo's mind?

243
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,520
And will he survive or die?!

244
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,920
Next Episode

245
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,010
Yo! It's me, Goku!

246
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,470
One of the ki sources vanished. Oh no!

247
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,470
Th-This is the reasoning of a parent.

248
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,930
Y-Your naivety rubbed off on me.

249
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,230
Piccolo-san, why? Don't die, Piccolo-san!

250
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,130
I'll make you pay, bastards!

251
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,830
Next time, on Dragon Ball Kai:

252
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,870
Piccolo's Shed Tears... Son Goku's Counterattack of Anger!

253
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:14,780
Piccolo's Shed Tears...
Son Goku's Counterattack of Anger!

254
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,450
Amazing! Father is so strong!

1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,070
His power is overwhelming! The struggle against the mighty Nappa wages on.

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,450
Goku's arrival is at hand.

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,450
However, the worst crisis is just about to happen.

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,960
Die!

Piccolo's Shed Tears...

16
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:14,860
Son Goku's Counterattack of Anger!

17
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:13,470
Piccolo's Shed Tears... Son Goku's Counterattack of Anger!

18
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,110
Die!

19
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,160
P-Piccolo-san.

20
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,090
Run away, G-Gohan.

21
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,590
P-Piccolo-san, why did you save me?

22
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,430
I-I told you to run away. If you do not hurry...

23
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,290
Don't die!

24
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,840
Father will be here any second now, and he'll beat them!

25
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,230
Please, don't die!

26
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,010
Idiots, now the order I was gonna kill you in has changed. Oh well.

27
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,280
It doesn't really matter.

28
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,870
O-One of the ki sources is gettin' smaller and smaller.

29
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,330
I-Is someone dyin'?

30
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,270
It seems as though this is where my life ends.

31
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,350
G-Goku did not make it in time.

32
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,350
But in the end, Piccolo surpassed me as God.

33
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,850
I'm quite happy.

34
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,340
God...

35
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,800
Th-This is really pathetic.

36
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,360
T-To think that a person such as I, the Great Demon King Piccolo, would protect a brat.

37
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,680
How horrible.

38
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,580
M-Mister!

39
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,510
Gohan...

40
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,010
Y-You were the only one who I could sincerely converse with.

41
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:51,260
But, Father said that the reborn Piccolo-san isn't a bad person like he was before.

42
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,970
I think so, too.

43
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,940
Mommy and Grandpa were afraid though.

44
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,530
That's unfair!

45
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,480
You said you weren't gonna use your eyes.

46
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,900
Do not be so soft!

47
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,740
Promises like that are not kept during a battle!

48
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,450
B-But...

49
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,350
B-But...

50
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,690
Piccolo-san, you're not an enemy.

51
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,870
I-It was not bad, the one year I spent with you...

52
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,790
Mister!

53
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Do not die, G-Go...

54
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,840
Mister!

55
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,850
Mr. Popo, the rest is up to you.

56
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,950
God!

57
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,600
God!

58
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,410
How amusing! You wanna fight me?

59
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,950
Masenkou!

60
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,620
A-Amazing ki.

61
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,580
700... 1,200...

62
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,410
2,400.

63
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,090
Battle power is 2,800!

64
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,390
As I thought, these guys can change their battle power in a flash.

65
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,260
2,800, is it?

66
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,620
That's quite impressive for a little shrimp like you.

67
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,450
My damn arm's a bit numb now.

68
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,380
His battle power fell like a stone.

69
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,080
It would seem that he's expended his power.

70
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,380
P-Piccolo-san, forgive me. I couldn't avenge you.

71
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,930
Gohan, run away! You gotta run!

72
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,890
Now I'm gonna send you to the Afterlife, short stuff.

73
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,850
I don't have the strength to run away.

74
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,900
I look forward to seeing Kakarotto's face...

75
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,910
...when he sees his son squashed like a bug!

76
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,050
K-Kinto-Un?!

77
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,720
Father!

78
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,850
Goku!

79
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,650
You finally show yourself.

80
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,320
What did you come here for, Kakarotto?

81
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:06,040
Don't tell me that you came here to defeat us or something, because that would be a really bad joke.

82
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,550
Piccolo...

83
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
Piccolo-san died trying to protect me.

84
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,310
Tenshinhan...!

85
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,530
Yamucha...!

86
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,720
Are you shocked to see your foolish friends dead?

87
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,790
Come to think of it, there was a shrimp that blew himself to pieces here, too.

88
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,590
The shrimp couldn't match my power, though.

89
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,650
I see, so then, even Chaozu... and now God, too!

90
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,510
Damn it...!

91
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,070
No need to grieve. You'll join 'em too in a minute.

92
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,200
Even though you're showing off by coming back to life.

93
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,410
His battle power is rapidly increasing.

94
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,870
What now?

95
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,930
You wanna die already?

96
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,380
This is my way of saying, "Hello!"

97
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,960
He's fast!

98
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,940
Gohan, this way.

99
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,330
Kuririn.

100
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,490
G-Goku.

101
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,850
Sorry for being late. You two did well in holdin' out.

102
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,810
Here, take a half each.

103
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,630
I-Isn't that a magic bean? Did Karin-sama still have some?

104
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,490
Yeah, it's the last one.

105
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,700
I-In that case, you eat it.

106
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,830
Don't worry, I've already had one.

107
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,690
No, you keep it, just in case.

108
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,340
W-We won't be much help even if we get back on our feet.

109
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,950
Don't worry too much.

110
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,260
If you don't eat it, I'll just throw it away.

111
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,340
Here!

112
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,470
Sorry.

113
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,610
Gohan, you too.

114
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,350
O-Okay.

115
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,870
Kuririn, you've improved like crazy. I felt your ki before.

116
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,240
Well, that may have been so, but it's still no good.

117
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,900
We don't hold any water. They're too strong.

118
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,360
Everyone... everyone died right before my eyes.

119
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,310
Gohan, you've changed a lot. You must've trained hard.

120
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,280
Yeah, Piccolo-san trained me.

121
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,250
But I still wasn't able to do anything.

122
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,880
Piccolo-san is dead, so we can never use the Dragon Balls again.

123
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
We can't bring anybody back to life.

124
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,140
Let's avenge them together.

125
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,310
If Goku's with us, then we may be able to avenge at least one of them.

126
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,090
Right, Goku? You trained at that amazing Kaiou guy's place, right?

127
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,020
Yeah.

128
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,320
But I'll take 'em on alone.

129
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,450
You guys stay back and watch, or you'll get hurt.

130
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,990
A-Alone?!

131
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,850
Th-That's absurd, even for you, Goku!

132
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,580
Those guys are stronger than we have imagined.

133
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,040
I-It's true, Father!

134
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,430
G-Goku!

135
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,830
F-Father!

136
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,630
Let's just leave it to him.

137
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,980
B-But...

138
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,270
This is the first time I've ever seen Goku so angry.

139
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,820
W-We shouldn't get in his way.

140
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,340
What's with the look on your face? I don't like it.

141
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,880
You really wanna die that quickly?

142
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,890
I'm gonna make ya pay, you bastards!

143
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,280
Not for sale, rent, eBay, or profit of any kind.

144
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,280
If you paid for this you were ripped off!

145
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,290
F-Father's amazing!

146
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,810
Battle power is 7,000... 8,000...

147
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,160
Impossible!

148
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,160
Vegeta!

149
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,020
What's the reading on Kakarotto's battle power now?

150
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,230
It's over 8,000!

151
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,860
Over 8,000?! There must be some mistake! It must be broken!

152
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,030
Don't worry. I ain't usin' my Kaiou-ken on you guys just yet.

153
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,330
Kaiou-ken?

154
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,540
Shut the hell up!

155
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,290
There's no way you can match up against the Great Nappa!

156
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,680
What?!

157
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,640
H-How did he do that just now?

158
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,560
Wh-When did you get behind me?

159
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,530
B-Bastard!

160
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,230
You're pretty cocky for someone that ain't too big a deal.

161
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,530
Wh-What was that?!

162
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,470
M-Me, as great as I am... not a big deal?!

163
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,120
That's right. I saw that with my attack just now.

164
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,830
What you just saw...

165
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,420
Is what I'll teach you now!

166
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,560
Strange. It's as if his battle power is completely different from when he fought Raditz.

167
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,070
Over here!

168
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,040
C-Could you see your father's movement?

169
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,460
Nah-uh, but it's amazing!

170
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,900
What's the meaning of this?

171
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,010
How did that Kakarotto increase his power so much in such a short time?!

172
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,450
That one was for Chaozu.

173
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,970
Damn it all!

174
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,200
Here's one for you, Yamucha!

175
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,550
Asshole!

176
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,170
Y-You piece of shit!

177
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,020
I ain't even dodgin' somethin' like this!

178
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,570
What?!

179
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,200
H-His shout cancelled it out!

180
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,640
Damn it!

181
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,060
This one's for Tenshinhan!

182
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,200
Wh-Why?!

183
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,990
Why does Kakarotto have this much power?!

184
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,630
What?!

185
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,670
And this one is for Piccolo!

186
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,680
Damn it!

187
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,940
Y-You're amazing! You're truly amazing, Goku!

188
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,780
Yeah!

189
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,120
Son of a bitch!

190
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,220
Damn you to Hell!

191
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,560
I see now. As expected, you're not that tough.

192
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,480
I'm an elite warrior from a noble family!

193
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,480
I won't allow some low-class trash like you to make fun of nobility like me!

194
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,060
You're gonna pay! I'll freakin' kill your ass!

195
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,740
You dunce! Get yourself together!

196
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,120
If you can keep your cool, then he shouldn't be able to match you!

197
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,180
Nappa, take it down a notch!

198
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,330
I see. Thanks a lot, Vegeta.

199
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,860
You've allowed me to see more clearly.

200
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,610
That one-tracked buffoon!

201
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,520
If it goes on like this, I'll have to step in.

202
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,050
You've truly angered me.

203
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,770
From here on out, I'll show you what I'm really good for.

204
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,400
You ready for this, Kakarotto?

205
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,010
I like where this is going.

206
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,280
I got high hopes.

207
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,490
You're just bluffing.

208
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,600
He's not bluffing or anything like that.

209
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,710
He's got elbow room and complete confidence in himself.

210
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,250
G-Goku...

211
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,430
Father...

212
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,770
I can see you!

213
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,240
Ain't this a whole lot better?

214
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,820
Better, huh?

215
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,580
You won't be talking like such a smart ass in a moment.

216
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,200
I'll end you with this!

217
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,140
What a guy!

218
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,080
He managed to return the attack at such a close range!

219
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,280
It would've been bad if that thing hit me.

220
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:09,950
I-Impossible! That was my best technique, and he just brushed it aside.

221
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,060
You're a really tough bastard.

222
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,090
He should've taken at least a small hit from my Kamehameha.

223
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,620
It seems like there ain't gonna be an end to this at this rate.

224
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,650
That's enough! Come down here, Nappa!

225
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,340
It'll go nowhere with you fighting, so I'll settle this.

226
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,130
What?!

227
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:32,260
You're pathetic. To think that I have to step in to take care of Kakarotto myself...

228
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,960
S-So he's finally stepping in now?

229
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,560
He clearly made that big guy scared.

230
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,170
Is it finally time for the battle with Vegeta?!

231
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,800
Next Episode

232
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,090
Yo! It's me, Goku!

233
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,050
This guy killed his own comrade.

234
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:58,350
Be grateful that some dunce like you gets to fight a super-elite like me!

235
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,370
Then this dunce will get to surpass an elite then.

236
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,350
Let me show you the wall which cannot be surpassed with hard work alone!

237
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,860
Next time, on Dragon Ball Kai:

238
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,320
This is the Kaiou-ken!!
A Battle to the Limit: Goku vs Vegeta

239
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,320
This is the Kaiou-ken!!
A Battle to the Limit: Goku vs Vegeta

240
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,660
Go get him, Father!

1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,420
Upon returning, Son Goku manages to overpower Nappa.

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,240
I-Impossible! That was my best technique.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,580
That's enough!

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,800
It'll go nowhere with you fighting, so I'll settle this.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,750
What?!

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:30,000
You're pathetic. To think that I have to step in to take care of Kakarotto myself...

00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:14,900
This is the Kaiou-ken!!
A Battle to the Limit: Goku vs Vegeta

18
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,490
D-Damn it all.

19
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,910
I-I'm turning over your execution to Vegeta because it's an order,

20
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,870
so I'm leaving it to him.

21
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,690
Still, I'm not satisfied with backing out like this.

22
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,090
Crap! He's going after those two!

23
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,720
This is bad! I won't make it.

24
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,230
Kaiou-ken!

25
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,790
What?!

26
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,800
Damn... it.

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,530
He's finished for now.

28
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,140
Now, chop-chop, take this guy with ya and leave Earth without a trace.

29
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,700
Wh-What was that just now?

30
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,520
Both his speed and power rapidly grew in an instant.

31
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,150
G-Goku, how did you do that?

32
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,610
Was it a technique that Kaiou-sama person taught you?

33
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,940
Yeah, it's Kaiou-ken.

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,800
It controls all the ki in your body and momentarily amplifies it.

35
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,830
If you do it right, your power, speed, offense, defense, all of it will be multiplied.

36
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,570
Wow! You've grown this much stronger, and you're still able to increase your strength several times past that?

37
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,800
Yeah.

38
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,150
Goku, you're so mischievous.

39
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,520
This isn't the time to fool around, is it?

40
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,910
If you have such an ace up your sleeve, then use it from the start.

41
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,520
Sorry, but that won't do.

42
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,150
If I don't suppress and control my ki right, then I'll screw myself over.

43
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,820
In other words...

44
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,620
To be frank, at your level, you mustn't use the Kaiou-ken too much.

45
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,120
If you mess up your control, you'll destroy your body.

46
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,960
Only go as far as twice your power.

47
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:40,730
Listen, if you take the Kaiou-ken beyond that, you'll put too much of a burden on your body.

48
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:46,010
In other words, your body won't be able to keep up with the Kaiou-ken and it'll just backfire on you.

49
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,350
Okay, I get what you mean.

50
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,600
That's how it is.

51
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,310
I-I see.

52
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,760
V-Vegeta, p-please help me.

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,730
I-I'm really sorry.

54
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,380
No worries.

55
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,500
Wh-What are you–?!

56
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,920
Vegeta! Vegeta!

57
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,840
I have no use for a broken down Saiya-jin.

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,820
Wh-What a ki!

59
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,390
F-Father.

60
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,810
Wh-What's going on?

61
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,690
Die!

62
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,790
Ve-Vegeta!

63
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,870
W-W-W-What's with this guy?

64
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,020
He just killed his own comrade.

65
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,740
Gohan, Kuririn...

66
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,370
You two head straight back to the Kame House now.

67
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,240
I-I get it.

68
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,630
Gohan, you heard him. Let's hurry and leave!

69
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,130
B-But...

70
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,040
Gohan, that guy is far too terrible.

71
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,740
We won't be of any good if we stay here.

72
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,060
If we stay here, Goku will have to keep an eye on us, and we'll just be a burden.

73
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,150
Really, Father?

74
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,200
Sorry, but it looks like he's stronger than I thought.

75
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,030
O-Okay, I understand.

76
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,790
By the way, Goku, could you take your fight away from this area?

77
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,900
It'd be bad if everyone's bodies are mangled when they come back to life.

78
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,500
"When they come back to life"?

79
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,900
When Piccolo dies, God dies as well.

80
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,540
The Dragon Balls are inert now.

81
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,600
It's really unfortunate, but we can't bring everyone back to life again.

82
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,190
Yeah, I know that.

83
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,560
K-Kuririn-san, are you saying...

84
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,150
Wh-What?

85
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,160
I'll give you the details later.

86
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,490
If you're able to win against that guy...

87
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,580
If I can win, huh? True, I gotta win anyway.

88
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,240
One way or another.

89
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,770
What're you doing? What happened to the vigor you had a moment ago?

90
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,090
Are you getting cold feet and plotting how you'll escape from me?

91
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,050
Well then, I'll take him somewhere else. Wish me luck, 'kay?

92
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,470
Anyway, just leave it to me.

93
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:25,020
Goku, sorry for always leaving my fate in your hands.

94
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,560
Don't you die, my friend.

95
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,650
Right.

96
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,380
Father.

97
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,880
Gohan.

98
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,450
When Daddy comes home alive, we'll be sure to do some fishin'.

99
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,290
Okay!

100
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,800
It seems as though you realize how pointless it is to run away.

101
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,810
Let's fight somewhere else.

102
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,520
Have it your way.

103
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,730
It doesn't matter to me.

104
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,410
Father.

105
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,170
As I thought, he's keeping up with no effort.

106
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,960
Gohan.

107
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,600
Hey, Gohan.

108
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,620
Yes?

109
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,180
Let's hurry back to Kame House.

110
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,530
You don't have to worry now.

111
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,690
Earth's fate is now in his hands.

112
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,370
It'll be okay, Gohan.

113
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,620
Goku will get it done for sure.

114
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Come on now. Show your mother that you're in good shape.

115
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,660
Okay.

116
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,750
Here should be fine 'cause there ain't no people or animals.

117
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,230
I get it now.

118
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,430
You chose this as your place of burial, am I correct?

119
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,610
You should be glad.

120
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,930
A low class soldier such as you gets to play with a super-elite.

121
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,900
A Saiya-jin has his warrior qualities examined immediately after birth.

122
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:03,780
The trash that scores low at that time, such as yourself, are sent to planets with no significant opponents.

123
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,810
In short, you're but a leftover dunce!

124
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,580
And thanks to that, I came to this Earth.

125
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,400
I gotta thank ya. Besides,

126
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,070
maybe even a dunce can surpass an elite if he trains hard enough.

127
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,160
That's a good one.

128
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,450
Then, let me show you the wall which cannot be surpassed with hard work alone!

129
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,350
Not for sale, rent, eBay, or profit of any kind.

130
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,350
If you paid for this you were ripped off!

131
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,050
What's the matter, Kakarotto? Is this all you got?

132
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,760
You weren't like this when you defeated that fool, Nappa!

133
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,840
Show me!

134
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,390
As I expected.

135
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:01,530
He ain't serious at all yet, but he has better speed and techniques than me.

136
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,990
Show me.

137
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,380
Or have you perhaps expended your power already?

138
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,760
Fine, I'll show you then!

139
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,430
Kaiou-ken!

140
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,730
I'm quite disappointed in you if that was your limit.

141
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,280
What a bastard.

142
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,630
But, you know...

143
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,950
I'm really fired up, even at a dangerous time like this.

144
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:21,850
He's smiling. He's either hopelessly defiant,
or he's capable of increasing his battle power even further.

145
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,960
What's the matter? Are you done already?

146
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,600
You appear to have reached your limit.

147
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,430
Then, I'll show you a souvenir to take with you to your death.

148
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,510
The overwhelming power of a super-elite Saiya-jin.

149
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,440
I'll wipe that little smirk right off of your face now!

150
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,350
What a ki! It's as if the whole Earth is shakin'.

151
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,900
It's like a typhoon!

152
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,680
The atmosphere stopped shakin'.

153
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,990
A-And the clouds are gone!

154
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,790
It's over, Kakarotto.

155
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,390
Fool!

156
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,510
Behind you!

157
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,110
Kaiou-ken times two!

158
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,730
Yes, very good. Well dodged.

159
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,500
I made it easy for you though, because it'd be boring if you died without any effort.

160
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,320
Damn it. He has such great power and speed.

161
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,010
I can't keep up with him, even while using a double Kaiou-ken.

162
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,280
Ain't got no choice, huh?

163
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,870
If this crushes my body, then so be it.

164
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,870
I gotta raise my Kaiou-ken to threefold!

165
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,620
I couldn't help but come here to look at things since I was so close.

166
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:37,050
What is this? That bastard and Goku are way too strong. It's like I'm having a nightmare.

167
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,860
Now then, I'm gonna raise my Kaiou-ken to threefold,

168
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,730
so I hope my body can take it.

169
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,150
What's the matter, Kakarotto? Come on.

170
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:59,110
I ain't got no choice anyway. There ain't no way I can win like this.

171
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,950
Have you nothing else up your sleeve?

172
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,380
You turned out to be a poor opponent.

173
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,730
I used to be the top dog among the Saiya-jin.

174
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,850
No matter how much you train, you'll still be a leftover dunce.

175
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,880
You've only delayed your hour of defeat by just a little.

176
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,070
This is hopeless.

177
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,910
That Saiya-jin bastard has a huge upper-hand here.

178
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,090
I should just run away right away.

179
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,920
Yeah, I'll just run away.

180
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,560
I just couldn't help but come here.

181
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,250
Please, hold on, body! Triple Kaiou-ken!

182
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,010
No! You mustn't exceed two times, Son Goku!

183
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,270
But when I think about it, he certainly doesn't have a chance of winning like it is now.

184
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,680
Could it be that he's that strong?

185
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,810
This battle may turn out really bad.

186
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,790
Wh-What's the matter?

187
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,620
D-Did something happen?

188
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,790
I think it's probably Son-kun, but the reading of this battle power is rising tremendously.

189
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:39,820
Goku!

190
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,880
Goku-sa!

191
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,200
17,000... 19,000... 21,000...

192
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,930
N-No way...

193
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,720
Wh-What?!

194
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,080
Goku is using the forbidden triple Kaiou-ken..

195
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,930
Will his body be able to bear this power to the limit?

196
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,840
Next Episode

197
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,550
Yo! It's me, Goku!

198
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,470
My body is rattlin' already from the triple Kaiou-ken.

199
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,260
Why does your battle power exceed mine?! You'll pay!

200
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,690
Looks like I just gotta stake it all on the Genkidama.

201
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,520
I'll put an end to this quickly, Vegeta!

202
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,110
That's my line. I hate it, but this is my trump card!

203
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,570

I'll fight too, Father!

1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,070
Vegeta personally put an end to Nappa.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,200
Before his incomparable raw power,

3
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,920
Goku ultimately resolved to staking it all on a move that would push him beyond his limits.

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,140
Please hold on, body! Triple Kaiou-ken!

Incredible.

20
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,570
You asshole!

21
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,010
B-Bastard!

22
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,790
H-He can do it. Maybe he'll win after all.

23
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,820
I-Impossible.

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,920
He... Kakarotto exceeds my battle power!

25
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,430
D-D-D-Damn it.

26
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,710
He's pretty tough. If I don't finish this quickly...

27
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,850
Shit, my body...

28
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,760
I-I will not stand for this.

29
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,820
I am a super elite.

30
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,310
There's no way such a low-class warrior can beat me!

31
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,540
I am the greatest in the universe!

32
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,930
It looks like usin' the triple Kaiou-ken really is too much for me.

33
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,750
If I don't beat him soon, I'll end up dyin' myself.

34
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,930
Blood!

35
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,780
This trash made me shed my blue blood!

36
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,250
H-He'll pay. Definitely...

37
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,230
You'll definitely pay!

38
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,750
I'll wipe the likes of this planet out of existence!

39
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,420
I'll take pleasure in blowing your Earth into bits and pieces!

40
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,760
What?!

41
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,180
Dodge this if you think you can.

42
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,750
Even if you manage to save yourself, Earth will still be in shambles!

43
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,000
You thought this through, damn it!

44
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,510
I gotta put it all on the line.

45
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,670
A triple Kaiou-ken...

46
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,170
Kamehameha!

47
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,350
Ka...

48
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,990
Me...

49
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,970
Ha...

50
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,500
There's no way you can take my Gyalic-hou head on!

51
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,140
Me...

52
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,230
Earth will be nothing but space dust!

53
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,200
Ha!

54
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,280
Wh-What?!

55
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,480
That attack's identical to my Gyalic-ho!

56
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,420
Kaiou-ken times four!

57
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,800
I-It's forcing me back!

58
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,350
H-H-H-He did it.

59
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,700
He did it!

60
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,140
Son!

61
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,600
Ya did it after all, ya bastard!

62
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,410
Yajirobe, why are you here?

63
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,140
What, ya didn't notice?

64
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,930
You and that other guy were real desperate.

65
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,130
I guess.

66
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,060
But ya really gave that guy a can full of whoop-ass.

67
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,540
Ya really suprised me, ya bastard.

68
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,630
Wh-What? What's with ya?

69
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,410
I used a technique that was too much for my body.

70
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,690
Well, it was outta this world, for sure.

71
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,230
Anyway, Yajirobe, you should get outta here.

72
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,160
Why?

73
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,170
Y-Ya don't mean...

74
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,930
He's survived.

75
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,090
If he'd get killed by somethin' like that, I wouldn't have any trouble.

76
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,220
B-But that doesn't matter, does it?

77
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,720
Yer stronger than him, right?

78
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,780
I told you, I demanded too much from my body, so now it's beat up.

79
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,990
I might be close to my limit already.

80
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,770
I-I see.

81
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,900
See ya.

82
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,250
G-G-Good luck!

83
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,720
Fucking shit!

84
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,800
Why?! Why the hell is Kakarotto's battle power greater than mine?!

85
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,720
That little dipshit!

86
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,130
I am a Saiya-jin!

87
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,970
I am the strongest in the whole world!

88
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,480
I have a trump card for times like this, although I really don't want to use it.

89
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,760
I'll transform into a Great Ape and crush him.

90
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,130
I, as a Great Ape, will have tremendous strength.

91
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,840
Damn it, I chose to come here on a day with a full moon so the people on this planet could quickly be dealt with.

92
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,570
To think that I'd have to transform just to defeat Kakarotto...

93
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,620
It makes me furious!

94
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,510
This is strange. It's already past the time when the moon should be visible.

95
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,180
Saiya-jin, it's pointless, no matter where you look. The moon is gone.

96
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,390
The one known as Piccolo destroyed it a long time ago, fearing something like this.

97
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,440
However, Son Goku shouldn't have any strength left.

98
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,400
Even if the Saiya-jin doesn't transform, it might not change this crisis at all.

99
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,820
But he's been weakened as well.

100
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,940
The Genkidama... As long as he hits him with it, he'll win for sure.

101
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,370
How odd. He's aimlessly movin' around.

102
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,090
Why won't he come down here?

103
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,960
Gone, gone, gone!

104
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,700
Damn it! No matter where I look, the moon's gone.

105
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,510
What is the meaning of this?!

106
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,320
I get it, damn it. That bastard really knows how to push my buttons.

107
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,510
That Kakarotto destroyed the moon in advance.

108
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,400
So be it.

109
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,210
It'll reduce my battle power somewhat, but it seems I have no other choice.

110
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,120
The terrified look on his face will be a sight to behold.

111
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,420
Not for sale, rent, eBay, or profit of any kind.

112
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,420
If you paid for this you were ripped off!

113
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,340
He finally came down here.

114
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,340
I gotta use the Genkidama if I wanna win against him.

115
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,350
I wonder if I can I concentrate enough?

116
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,230
Kakarotto!

117
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,780
It won't go your way, even though you've destroyed the moon.

118
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,220
The moon? What about it?

119
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,740
You're just feigning ignorance.

120
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,950
Do you know the reason why we transform when we stare up at the moon?

121
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,760
Transform?

122
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,380
Moonlight is reflected sunlight.

123
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,150
Sunlight contains Bruit Waves, but only when it's reflected off of a moon.

124
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:07,720
Those Bruit waves exceed 17,000,000 zeno during a full moon.

125
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,770
What's he blabberin' about?

126
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:17,650
Once you absorb 17,000,000 zeno of Bruit Waves, a reaction takes place in your tail,

127
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,440
and your transformation begins.

128
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:26,100
Only a select few Saiya-jin are able to create an artificial full moon that exceeds 17,000,000 zeno.

129
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,450
Your prediction was off. You may have destroyed the moon,

130
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,620
but I can compound the oxygen of a planet with a power ball such as this one!

131
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,210
I've been waiting for this, Kakarotto.

132
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,790
The hour of your demise is finally here.

133
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:50,030
The low-class warrior shouldn't have challenged the super-elite to a fight, after all.

134
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,780
Just now, when he made that strange light, his ki decreased.

135
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,560
What is he planning to do, to go that far?

136
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,780
What?!

137
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,200
Burst and mix!

138
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,700
Wh-What...?

139
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,700
What is that? What did he do?!

140
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,150
C-Could it be...?

141
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,320
That guy created a moon!

142
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,010
You should regret losing your tail, Kakarotto!

143
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,640
Is this it?

144
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,200
Wh-What?

145
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,910
H-Hey, look over there...

146
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,510
Th-That's the direction we came from.

147
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,030
What could it be? It's bright as Hell.

148
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,160
This can't be...!

149
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,470
Wh-What? A huge ki is swelling.

150
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,090
Father's ki didn't increase again, did it?

151
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,150
Y-Yeah. This creepy feeling must come from that guy's ki.

152
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,190
No matter what, it's enormous.

153
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,690
What's going on?

154
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,590
F-Father...

155
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,170
Gohan.

156
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,870
I-I'm going back.

157
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm going back.

158
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,880
G-Going back? To Goku?

159
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,260
I know that Father is in danger.

160
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,970
He'll die at this rate.

161
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,070
What are you saying, Gohan?

162
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:27,060
Goku is your father. There's no way he'd die.

163
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,070
More importantly, that guy has some incredible ki, so even if we go there...

164
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,340
Yes, I know that.

165
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,740
But...!

166
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,260
I have to go, no matter what!

167
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,220
H-H-H-Hey!

168
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,730
Hold on, Gohan!

169
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,500
How's this, Kakarotto?

170
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,430
It's over for you!

171
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,020
How did it come to this?

172
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,500
A-A Great Ape? A great ape monster?

173
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,920
Why don't I teach you something good?

174
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,430
When a Saiya-jin becomes a Great Ape,

175
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:44,350
his battle power goes up tenfold!

176
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,280
Goku, during nights of the full moon, great ape monsters come out.

177
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,520
Therefore, you must not go outside.

178
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,030
You'll be safe if you sleep.

179
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,440
How about I get rid of that tail forever?

180
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,660
I think it will somehow only be in your way.

181
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,330
I see. I finally get it now.

182
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,480
This is somethin' else.

183
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,000
The one who stepped on Grandpa and killed him,

184
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,890
and the monster that appeared at the martial arts tournament and destroyed the buildings...

185
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,660
T-That was all me?

186
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,030
Forgive me, Grandpa.

187
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,980
This guy is terrifying.

188
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,940
If I don't use all of my ki, I don't think I have any chance of winnin'.

189
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,200
Next time I die and go to the Afterlife, I'm gonna go and apologize to you.

190
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,030
I'm gonna show you, Vegeta!

191
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,650
Mine and the Earth's Genkidama,

192
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,090
I'm gonna give you mouthful of it!

193
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,140
F-Father...

194
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,190
Goku, he truly is your son.

195
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,360
K-Kaiou-ken!

196
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,350
What's the matter?

197
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,960
You can't even run away, can you?!

198
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,610
Die!

199
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,680
What's wrong, Kakarotto?

200
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,410
Are you that helpless?

201
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,290
He came outta nowhere with insane speed!

202
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,130
I ain't got no time to concentrate on creating my Genkidama.

203
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,250
Even if I increase my Kaiou-ken to fivefold, it ain't gonna be good enough against him.

204
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,160
Won't you come at me?

205
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,680
Then I will come at you!

206
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,860
A desperate situation!

207
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:38,560
Will Goku be able to create a Genkidama against Vegeta, who has transformed into a Great Ape?

208
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,540
Shit, if I was just able to get ten free seconds!

209
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,210
Give me time to concentrate!

210
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,920
Next Episode

211
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,570
Yo! It's me, Goku!

212
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,140
I have to collect the energy from within Earth, damn it!

213
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,560
Vegeta's attacks are way too fast. The Genkidama...

214
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,060
I don't know what you're doing, but it's futile.

215
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,310
I'll take pleasure in crushing you with these hands of mine!

216
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,900
Cut it out! Let go of Father!

217
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,210
What?! Are they going after my tail?!

218
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,570
Next time, on Dragon Ball Kai:

219
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:14,780
Goku in a Desperate Situation!
Entrust Your Wishes to the Genkidama

220
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,240
Goku in a Desperate Situation!
Entrust Your Wishes to the Genkidama

221
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,410
I'm gonna defeat ya!

1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:12,900
Goku has been forced into an uphill battle by Vegeta, who has transformed into a Great Monkey.

2
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,390
What's wrong, Kakarotto?

3
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,950
Are you that helpless?

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,370
I ain't got no time to concentrate on creatin' my Genki Dama.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,280
Shit, if only I was able to get ten free seconds!

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,990
Give me time to concentrate!

Entrust Your Wishes to the Genki Dama

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,870
O-Oh yeah!

20
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,960
Tenshinhan, I'm borrowin' your move.

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,020
Taiyou-ken!

22
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,720
Now, while he's blinded!

23
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,640
My eyes! My eyes!

24
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,070
A-Alright, this far should do it.

25
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,490
The ground,

26
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,830
the oceans,

27
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,710
and... every living being!

28
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,410
Please share a little of your energy with me!

29
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,720
I'm begging you!

30
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,620
Dammit, you impudent little...!

31
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,500
J-Just a little more.
Just a bit more and I can form the Genki Dama.

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Wh-What the?

33
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:17,230
His eyesight's comin' back, but at this range,
I can launch the Genki Dama before his attack.

34
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,410
You dog!

35
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,740
Where are you?!

36
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,650
Where?!

37
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,920
Where the hell did you go?!

38
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,200
Running away is pointless.
I can sense your presence!

39
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,220
I've got the energy now.

40
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,890
You little...!

41
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,560
He's found me!
Please let me make it.

42
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,280
Th-There. I've got energy from the entire Earth now.

43
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,450
Okay!

44
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,180
Chew on this!

45
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,340
What? What happened?

46
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,480
T-To think that the attack'd hit me...

47
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,130
I-I made a grave error.

48
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,960
Man, and now the Genki Dama's gone to waste.

49
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,420
You're a tenacious bastard,

50
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,760
but you seem to be at your limit. We both can tell.

51
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,830
I give up. I still ain't got no chance of winnin'.

52
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,850
I used most of my ki on the Genki Dama.

53
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,720
Well, now what?

54
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,500
Goku's ki is quickly getting smaller.

55
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,110
F-Father!

56
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,720
Hurry! It's just up ahead!

57
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,860
Whoops, my bad, my bad.

58
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,780
Looks like I've carelessly stepped on and crushed your legs.

59
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,570
Well then, allow me to carelessly crush your heart next.

60
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,260
It's over for you now, Kakarotto.

61
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,830
Even if you should come back to life again,
this planet will be no more by then.

62
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,240
D-Dammit, what a complete and utter loss.

63
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,840
I'm glad that I fought someone so strong,
and with such a different power than mine,

64
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,330
but I wasn't plannin' on gettin' killed...

65
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,180
This is so frustratin'...

66
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,620
Die!

67
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,980
That was my last-ditch effort.

68
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,270
N-Now I don't even have the strength to pick my nose.

69
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,000
D-Do what you want...

70
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,030
Kakarotto, you bastard, how dare you...

71
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,580
How dare you! How dare you injure my beautiful face!

72
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,870
You little...!

73
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,070
I'll take pleasure in crushing you with my hands!

74
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,590
Th-That looks tight.
It ain't no use, he's dead.

75
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,210
I ain't abandonin' ya.

76
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,200
I just can't do nothin'.

77
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,140
N-Nothin' personal!

78
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,460
Die in utmost pain!

79
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,650
We're close. It's just over there.

80
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,700
It's thanks to that strange ball of light
that it's so bright, even though it's evening.

81
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,450
Just what the hell is that?

82
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,000
K-Kuririn-san, there!

83
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,590
Get down, Gohan.

84
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,280
We have to get down and hide on the ground.

85
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,180
Wh-What is that?

86
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,990
Just hurry, you idiot!

87
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,410
Th-Those fellas...

88
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,390
No way... That guy became a damn Great Monkey too.

89
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,440
Looks like I've broken enough of your bones.

90
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,030
It hurts, doesn't it?

91
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,530
Goku's gonna get killed. This is bad.

92
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,070
This way.

93
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,960
Okay!

94
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,330
Hey!

95
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,580
Yajirobe!

96
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,670
Hey, just what do ya think that monster is?

97
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,990
It's a Saiyan.

98
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,260
We know.

99
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,980
Ya ain't got no chance of matchin' a monster like that.

100
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,590
Give it up!

101
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,230
We know that too,

102
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,880
but if we cut that guy's tail off, he'll turn back!

103
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,990
His tail?

104
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,720
His tail?

105
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,810
Listen, Gohan and Yajirobe,
you go around to his front and draw his attention.

106
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,730
I'll cut off his tail from behind when I see my chance.

107
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,190
Hurry!

108
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,730
Goku will die!

109
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,230
O-Okay!

110
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,100
Y-Ya gotta be kiddin'. Draw his attention?

111
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,960
You fellas don't know.

112
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,200
He'll be unbelievably strong even if he turns back.

113
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,920
Father, don't die!

114
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,990
Goku's ki is almost gone.

115
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,880
Shit, he's on the brink of death!

116
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:07,390
Not for sale, rent, eBay, or profit of any kind.

117
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:07,390
If you paid for this you were ripped off!

118
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,640
Father, don't die!

119
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,360
Something or someone's here.

120
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,980
Where?!

121
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,230
Over here!

122
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,400
Let go of Father!

123
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,850
What a surprise.
If it isn't Kakarotto's brat of a son.

124
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,600
Oh, I see. You came here to see the end of your father, didn't you?

125
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,660
Nice timing.
He's just about to die.

126
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,730
Now I'll finish this.

127
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,630
Kienzan!

128
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,780
You better watch closely,

129
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,610
as there will be nothing left after I've crushed him.

130
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,270
Kuririn-san, hurry!

131
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,450
It's a shame, but it looks like the fellow has passed out.

132
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,780
N-No way...

133
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,400
Did you think I wouldn't realize that at least one other person would be around here?

134
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,060
You insects appear to prefer empathy and whatnot.

135
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,380
So I questioned that this brat would come here nonchalantly.

136
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,800
You seem to know about my tail, but too bad for you.

137
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,560
Just you wait.

138
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,970
Once I'm done with Kakarotto, it's your turn.

139
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,430
G-Goddammit, what a guy this is.

140
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,100
This guy keeps his calm even when he's a monster.
He hasn't got any openings.

141
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,260
Sorry, Goku, I don't want to stand by and watch you die,

142
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,390
but this guy's ki is too much, I'm not even able to get close to him.

143
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,580
After all, It was a mistake made by you insects,
challenging me to a fight.

144
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,470
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

145
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,360
Stop it!

146
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,990
I see. So you want to die before your father?

147
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,700
O-Oh shit!

148
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,930
What's wrong? Are you so terrified that you can't move?

149
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,060
Okay!

150
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,560
I don't care what happens now!

151
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,130
G-Goddammit.

152
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,070
I-I didn't know there was another one!

153
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,320
M-My tail...!

154
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,400
H-He cut it off...

155
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,240
He cut off his tail.

156
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,030
You did it, Yajirobe!

157
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,920
He's turned back now!

158
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:12,910
Mother... fuckers!

159
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,270
You want to die so badly that you'd anger me?

160
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,780
Wh-What's going on?

161
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,730
Why did that monster...

162
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,710
Then I shall adhere to your wishes and
beat the everliving shit out of you.

163
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,790
You goddamn pieces of shit!

164
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,140
Gohan, run away!

165
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,420
I'll begin with you.

166
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,720
A half-Saiyan should be strong, shouldn't he?

167
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,360
How about you show me your true power, okay?

168
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,480
I wonder if that changed the order of things.

169
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,340
Now, stand up! You'll entertain me for a little while longer, won't you?

170
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,910
What's the matter with you?

171
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,750
Is that all you got?

172
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,390
After all, isn't a child of trash just trash?

173
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,920
You're trash, but apparently only your blood is red.

174
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,620
Shall I at least let you die next to your father?

175
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,180
I am a nice guy, after all.

176
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,390
There.

177
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,040
G-Gohan.

178
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,690
That Kakarotto is a tenacious one.

179
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,030
To think that he's still conscious.

180
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,620
Gohan...

181
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,580
Dad's body is beaten and broken, he can't move any more.

182
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,980
P-Please fight for him instead.

183
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,340
His power should've dropped enough for you to.

184
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,990
I-It's no use, Father...

185
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,380
He's way too strong...!

186
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,430
I can't win.

187
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,790
Okay, here's the deal.

188
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,390
Here's the order: I'll begin by killing Kakarotto.

189
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,300
Then I'll kill Kakarotto's brat.

190
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,600
And after that, I'll finish off that baldheaded bastard.

191
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,730
And finally, that bastard who cut off my precious and valuable tail.

192
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,740
He remembered!

193
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,430
Y-You don't have to win. Please just keep him in check.

194
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,410
Your power has to be even greater.

195
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:49,040
And then, Kuririn will finish him off for us.

196
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,810
It's not use...!

197
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,090
I can't move either.

198
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,470
You idiot, do you want everyone's deaths to be for nothin'?!

199
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,910
What did Piccolo teach you?!

200
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,980
It's up to you, Gohan...

201
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,180
G-Gohan.

202
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,740
You've been giving me a hard time.

203
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,550
Even though you're just damn leftover trash!

204
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,830
Cut it out...

205
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,790
Cut it out!

206
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,150
What?!

207
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm gonna...

208
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,420
defeat you!

209
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,730
You're going to defeat me?

210
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,760
What the hell?!

211
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,400
Kuririn...

212
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,550
Kuririn, I'm beggin' you, please come here!

213
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,070
Goddammit.

214
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,160
Don't make light of the Vegeta the Great!

215
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,900
Goku... There's no way.

216
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,730
That guy's still way too much.

217
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,440
Why didn't you tell Gohan to run away?!

218
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,280
I-I'll give it to you, Kuririn.

219
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,850
The Genki Dama that I formed from the entire Earth, that is...

220
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,530
Wait, what did you say?

221
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,310
What are you giving to me?

222
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,590
The Genki Dama.

223
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,700
Ki formed little by little from the entire Earth.

224
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,110
About half of it got away,
but I think you'll beat him with this.

225
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,530
Wh-What?

226
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,580
Kuririn, take my hand.

227
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,750
I-I don't get it at all.

228
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,420
Hurry! Gohan'll die!

229
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,670
C-Can I really hold your hand?

230
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,810
Please...

231
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,050
Like this?

232
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,060
Hey, isn't your arm broken?!

233
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,510
Don't let it go now.

234
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,190
I'm givin' it to you,
so please accept it.

235
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,410
Wh-what is this?!

236
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,400
A-Amazing.

237
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,010
It's a huge ki!

238
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,780
H-Hold your palm up and concentrate on it.

239
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,050
You'll form a sphere.

240
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,740
You little dipshit!

241
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,710
Please keep at it.

242
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,940
Gohan can't control that kinda ki.

243
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,410
I-I did it! I-Is this...

244
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,370
It's the Genki Dama. Y-You did it.

245
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,270
Persistent brat!

246
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,300
Kuririn, strike him with that.

247
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,510
I can't create another Genki Dama.

248
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,050
Please make sure you hit him with it. It's up to you now!

249
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,680
G-Got it. I'll do it.

250
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:43,040
Will Kuririn be able to take Vegeta out with the entrusted Genki Dama?!

251
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,920
Next Episode

252
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,970
Yo, it's me, Goku!

253
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,840
Please let the Genki Dama formed from our wishes hit.

254
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,370
To think that I'd be cornered this much by this damn trash.

255
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,620
You've wounded my pride.

256
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,680
Know your place, and drop dead!

257
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,190
Gohan, it's up to you now.
You're our last hope.

258
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,730
This fellow's tail has grown back.

259
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,360
Next time, on Dragon Ball Kai:

260
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,490
Defeating the Invincible Vegeta!

261
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,490
The Miraculous Son Gohan

262
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,570
Do you see a ball of light? A ball of light?!

1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,090
Goku saw death before his eyes.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,490
Although, he was surprisingly saved by Yajirobe.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,580
Backed by Gohan's resistance, Kuririn was entrusted with their last hope.

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,290
Kuririn, hit him with that.

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,120
G-G-Got it.

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,880
I'll do it.

00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:14,900
Defeating the Invincible Vegeta!

18
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:14,900
The Miraculous Son Gohan

19
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,960
He's so incredibly strong...

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
Even after being so worn out from fighting with Father.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,140
That shrimp is impressive, but he seems to be approaching his limit.

22
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,630
Masenkou!

23
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,850
The last of your futile resistance?

24
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,620
Shit!

25
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,960
One more!

26
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,880
Shit, I can't hit him at my level if he keeps moving like that.

27
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,910
The Genki Dama will not hit what your eyes see.

28
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,520
Feel out his evil ki, then throw it.

29
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,360
Wh-Who's there?!

30
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,360
The one who taught Son Goku the Genki Dama, Kaiou.

31
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,120
K-Kaiou-sama?

32
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,650
You'll settle this with a single attack.

33
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,040
That Genki Dama you're holding is a sphere filled with wishes from the whole Earth.

34
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,270
A sphere filled with wishes from the whole Earth...

35
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,060
No matter how many people come, they'll all be nothing more than trash when matched against an elite, after all.

36
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,860
By the time you realize that, it'll be far too late.

37
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,240
Feel out his evil ki, then throw it...

38
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,080
I get it.

39
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,790
Kuririn, it's up to you.

40
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,140
This is your only chance.

41
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,800
Playtime's over.

42
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,220
Think you can dodge it all?!

43
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,830
Feel it. I gotta feel his evil ki...

44
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,690
That fella's up to somethin'.

45
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,560
He's got some huge ki. If yer gonna do it, then do it already!

46
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,280
Watch closely, Kakarotto.

47
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,820
These will be the last few moments of your foolish child's life!

48
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,910
I got it!

49
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,620
What the hell're ya doin', idiot?! Hurry up and do it!

50
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,580
What?!

51
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,250
That idiot!

52
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,760
Go to Hell!

53
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,220
Wh-What the hell is that?!

54
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,860
Hit home!

55
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,020
I missed!

56
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,060
We're done for!

57
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,150
Bounce it back, Gohan!

58
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,250
Gohan, it's your ally.

59
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,080
You should be able to bounce it back if you ain't got evil ki.

60
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,160
He did it!

61
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,920
Yahoo!

62
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,380
Hooray!

63
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,200
We did it! We did it, Goku!

64
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,300
Thank God, Goku! We did it, we did it!

65
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,160
You finally did it, guys.

66
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,950
We thought we were done for way too many times.

67
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,330
You're both really beat up.

68
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,370
Not as much as you are.

69
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,790
I-Is the Saiyan...

70
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,480
Don't worry, he's dead.

71
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,950
You damn asshole, you were one hell of a guy, but maybe we should prepare a grave or something...

72
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,870
You mean a grave for yourselves?

73
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,210
I-It can't be.

74
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,920
He even managed to take the Genki Dama head-on!

75
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,330
You gave me quite the horrible experience.

76
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,020
I honestly thought I was going to die.

77
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:16,460
Y-You've damaged me considerably, but I still have enough power to take out the trash.

78
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:30,310
Once I've killed you all, I'll take some time to recover my strength, and then I'll blow this planet to smithereens.

79
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,530
Y-You bastards.

80
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,850
You've pushed the great Vegeta's powers all the way to their limit.

81
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:56,570
Even though you're all nothing but a pile of trash, you've still managed to wound my pride.

82
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,800
You bastards should know your place and drop dead!

83
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,610
Damn it...

84
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,540
Damn it!

85
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,000
G-Goku...

86
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,420
Not for sale, rent, eBay, or profit of any kind.

87
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,420
If you paid for this you were ripped off!

88
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,350
Fucking hell. That sucked ass, if I do say so myself.

89
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,170
The three of them are all still barely alive, damn it.

90
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,820
Th-The damage is greater than I thought.

91
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:56,810
I have to deal with these guys quickly and get some rest, or I'll...

92
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,290
Th-This brat...

93
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,440
He's grown his damn tail back.

94
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,080
H-His tail...

95
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,310
Oh, right. Goku's tail once suddenly appeared before, too.

96
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,760
Shit!

97
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,200
If I let him transform, there'll be hell to pay!

98
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,210
What?!

99
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,930
I did it! I killed him!

100
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,910
Take a look at that, ya damn bastard!

101
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,020
How's that for ya, eh, prick?!

102
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,580
There's no way ya could've matched up against me, Yajirobe the Great!

103
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,180
You little...

104
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,860
You little dipshit!

105
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,610
Uh, s-s-sorry, did it hurt?

106
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,780
I didn't mean it when I slashed at ya, it was just a joke!

107
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,690
Yeah, you've earned my respect.

108
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,490
So, wanna be friends?

109
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,910
Y-Yajirobe...

110
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,350
Anyone who harms my body will inevitably pay for it.

111
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,650
I'll make them pay for sure.

112
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,990
D-Damn it!

113
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,420
G-Gohan!

114
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,680
Gohan!

115
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,620
F-Father's voice...

116
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,050
G-Gohan, listen to my voice.

117
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,200
O-Okay.

118
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,230
Look at the ball of light that's in the sky.

119
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,170
Th-The ball of light?

120
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,420
There's a ball of light?

121
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,700
F-Fuck!

122
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,870
You think I'll let you?!

123
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,750
Die!

124
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,670
Oh, shit!

125
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,300
You damn brat, you think I'll just let you grow?!

126
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,220
Damn it!

127
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,270
I have to kill him right now!

128
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,270
G-Gohan, it's up to you!

129
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,820
G-Gohan as a Great Monkey... Well, that's either sink or swim.

130
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,070
T-That's right! The tail!

131
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,410
I forgot something so crucial amidst my panic!

132
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,160
If I just cut off his tail!

133
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,600
Gohan...

134
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,950
Although, Goku lost all his sense of reason when he became a Great Monkey.

135
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,970
What about Gohan?

136
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,950
It's the same with Gohan!

137
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:16,300
Well, wait... Maybe both Goku and Gohan turn into ferocious Saiyans only when they turn into Great Monkeys.

138
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,940
Gohan!

139
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,590
Gohan!

140
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,490
G-Gohan!

141
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,840
G-Gohan...

142
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,500
The Saiyan! Kill the Saiyan!

143
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,010
H-He...

144
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,180
Gohan!

145
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,750
Good, there are still remnants of Gohan's mind.

146
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,270
Th-That's right.

147
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,190
He's still half-earthling.

148
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,910
The moon I made won't die out for about an hour.

149
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,250
I've got to cut his tail off, after all.

150
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,550
D-Damn!

151
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,430
My power's...

152
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,390
Oh, go fuck yourself!

153
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,180
My body won't move...!

154
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,980
H-How did it turn out?

155
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,620
D-Did that do it?

156
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,730
H-He's still alive...?

157
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,190
What's that?

158
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,560
It's here...

159
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,900
To think that I, of all people, would ever retreat.

160
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,710
D-Damn it. The strongest warrior in the universe...

161
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,390
I, Vegeta the Great.

162
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,190
M-Must be his spaceship.

163
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,270
No way I'm letting him escape.

164
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,110
This is as far as you go.

165
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,890
I-I'm going to put an end to you.

166
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,430
Hold it!

167
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,900
This is for everyone you've killed!

168
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,290
Prepare yourself!

169
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,270
Shit! My body won't...

170
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,880
Next Episode

171
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,750
Yo! It's me, Goku!

172
00:22:47,900 --> 00:23:06,290
"Dragon Ball Kai" will not air next week.

173
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,580
Kuririn, Gohan, you did well in getting this far.

174
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,560
Everyone's dead, though.

175
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,430
Piccolo-san is dead, so God is gone, too.

176
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,020
However, if I recall correctly,

177
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,610
we might be able to get our hands on other Dragon Balls.

178
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,270
Next time, on Dragon Ball Kai:

179
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,360
A Hard-Fought Dawn...

180
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,360
The Star of Hope - Piccolo's Home

181
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,240
Where does Planet Namek lie?
