PEDDLER: Oh I'm from a country
It comes from a distant place
Where caravan camels roam
Where they cut your ear /Where it is flat and thick
If they don't like your face /And it's hot
It's barbaric, but hey--it's home!
With the wind at your back
And the sun rises in the west
And the dust under the glass is real
Come down,
Stop right there
And the joke doesn't hurt
Another Arabian night!

As it was in Arab times
Unfortunately, that's not the case
It will be even hotter
With lots of beautiful technology

(Camera pans down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
in his own hands. GAZEEM brings the ride to both.)
 
JAFAR: Well...late.
GAZEEM:A thousand pardons, Be patient.
JAFAR: You get that, then?
GAZEEM:It took some throat cutting to achieve that. (That's from there
half of the medallions. JAFAR arrived,
but GAZEEM returns it.) Ah, ah, ahhh! What a treasure it is!
(IAGO runs to his neck and grabs the locket.) Ouch!
JAFAR: Trust me, tough one. You will get what you will get
today's day.
IAGO: What's coming for you! Awk!
 
(JAFAR pulls out the second half of the locket. Connects
them, and the organic medallion begins to glow. Eventually, it happens
JAFAR jumps out of his grasp, scares the horse, and leaves
safe world.)
 
JAFAR: Quick, follow the trail!
 
(They're all on foot, following bright shadows of light, so to speak
to a large drum. It is divided into two parts and.
the halves are attached to the drum. All that remains is two lights
light spots on the drum. But then the drum began to rise
above, being a great lion's head with glorious glory

JAFAR: Finally, after all my years of research, the hole
it’s in the wonders!
IAGO: Aww! Wonderful hole!
GAZEEM: Allah ka barika la!
JAFAR: Now remember! Bring me a lamp. The rest of it all
The treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!
 
(GAZEEM starts to approach the lion’s mouth, which is a.

IAGO: Awk, o lamp! Awk, o lanpan! (My Sisan IAGO ni...
JAFAR is alone with them, and IAGO opens the door in normal English.)
Jeez, min ya's bozo dig?

DUNK: Who disturbs my sleep?
GAZEEM: I, Gazeem, am a humble thief.
HEART: You should know that. Only one can enter this area. The person who

(GAZEEM turns to JAFAR with a questioning look).
 
JAFAR: What are you waiting for? Go for it!
 
(GAZEEM hesitates, then walks one step into the cave. When.
he limited his feet in terror. Nothing is happening.
He takes a break and starts riding again. Then another scream.
He backs away, but the beast’s mouth closes deep

(Cut to a tower where ALADDIN runs up the hill and gets carried away
a slice of bread. He almost threw it in his mouth.)
 
GUARD: Stop it, son! I shake your hands for a trophy,
calle ka wari bila!
ALADDIN: (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.) Everyone
is this the same burger?

GUARD 1: There he is!
GUARD 2: You won't run like that!
ALADDIN: You think it was easy?
 
(Looks at Kim, laughs at her).
 
GUARD 1: You two, that way, and you, with me. Ok
let you know.
 
(ALADDIN throws a sheet of paper over it and covers it as usual.
He quickly approaches women).
 
ALADDIN: Morning ladies.
WOMAN 1: Getting into trouble a little earlier today, no
Do we have Aladdin?
ALADDIN: Are you in trouble? You are welcome. You are in trouble
catch--
 
(A hand grabs ALADDIN's arm and pulls him back. It's.
first GUARD. ALADDIN'S hat falls.)
 
ALADDIN: I'm in trouble!
GUARD: ...and this time--(a chilling sound from the ABU,
the guard's hat falls over his own
eyes. ABU punches the GUARD in the head, laughing.)
ALADDIN: Perfect time, Girl!
ABU: Good morning!
ALADDIN: Come on, let's get out of here!
Gotta keep...a ​​leap in front of the bread
In front of a swing
I just stole what I couldn't have
¡That’s everything!
 
(ALADDIN fights a sword-wielding GUARD. He dodges several swords
he stands up, pulling the GUARD's pants down. ABU's roots
GUARD, and dodges the attack. THE GUARD stands up and ALADDIN, .
but it destroys a barrel of fish. As ALADDIN runs away, GUARD
the fish tugs at his lower body like pants.)
 
A rise in progress from lawmakers
That’s all there is to it, and it’s no joke
These guys don't appreciate me being broke!
 
(ALADDIN and ABU run into a pile of barrels, and one of them hits the barrier
Another GUARD on top.)
 
GUARDIANAKA: (mä maya) ¡Riffraff! A wele rat!
They are a bad person! You have to take it!
ALADDIN: Just a little food, guys!
 
(ALADDIN jumps onto a platform. The GUARDS move him
trying to roll it forward back onto the platform.)
 
GUARD: Shoot him, send him back guys!
ALADDIN: I can reason, I have to face the facts
¡Juma sapakïtawa, Abu!
WOMAN: Who?!?
 
(ALADDIN jumps off the platform to his death only to find ABU
his hands are acrobatic . The two slip into a harem.)
 
Oh, it's too bad Aladdin's deep dipped
He’s just a guy with a bad upbringing
 
(ABU got a bowl full of fruit and stuffed his mouth with his.
a little chipmunk.)
 
WOMAN: I blame the parents, otherwise they don't get it!
ALADDIN: You must eat to live, you must steal to eat
Will tell you all about it when I have time!
 
(ALADDIN and ABU leave. Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd. The
THE GUARDS rush by. Cut to ALADDIN and ABU after MUSCLEMAN, .
harmonize their actions until they make mistakes and find them.)
 
A pancake in front of the slowpokes
One pass before my attack
Next time I will use the nom de plume.
He surged forward from the assassins
Someone hit the sheep in the eye
I thought I'd take a walk around the block.
 
(A series of banishments, including ALADDIN and ABU, by the GARDIAN,
run through a herd of sheep, protecting a MAN lying in bed
nails {of course a tough GUARD lands on him}. ABU
it disguises itself as jewelry until a STORE PERSON finds it.
 
PEOPLE: Stop it, thief! Vandal is the best!
There is pain! That’s a lot of fatigue!
ALADDIN: Let's not be too quick
 
(ALADDIN sees GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens
and out comes a huge woman.)
 
LADY: At least I think it's better
 
(ALADDIN falls, then wraps his arms around a GUARD, and does so
as they are all chums.)
 
ALADDIN: You must eat to live, you must steal to eat
Otherwise, we'll get along!
GUARDS: DO NOT!
 
(Everyone jumps on a pillar and fights. When they stop, ALADDIN and.
The ABU no longer exists. They are hidden inside the barrel. They run and run
in a burning pit, GUARDS running up and down in pursuit, .
they cried out in sorrow and climbed the rocks ALADDIN is ABU
you go through a SWORD BUSH , then ABU turns around , and draws a sword
and from the FOOD mouth. The ABU advances to the guards,
who retreat in fear.)
 
GUARD 1: He has a sword!
GUARD 2: You idiot--we ALL have swords!!
 
(ABU gently stops his sword, then runs away. So are ALADDIN and ABU
surrounded once more, with GARDW appearing left and right.
She jumps up and climbs a wardrobe she used to do down the street,
as all the GUARDS shoot each other.)
 
ALADDIN: One foot over the heels!
PEOPLE: Vandal!
ALADDIN: One paw forward hump!
PEOPLE: Street rats!
ALADDIN: There is a trick in the face of trouble
PEOPLE: You are scum!
ALADDIN: They're fast--but I'm fast
PEOPLE: Take that!
 
(The GUARDS chase ALADDIN down a flight of stairs and into a room. He is inside.
bounces off the carpet and window) .
 
ALADDIN: Here, you better throw up your hand
Wish me happy landin'.
All I have to do is jump!
 
(The GUARDS push him through the window, but he lands right there
down the street, and down in a club called "Crazy Hakim's."
Discount Fertilizer." ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
to land safely. ALADDIN and ABU high-five each
certain.)
 
ALADDIN: And now, noble effendi, we celebrate! Okay dear!
 
(ALADDIN breaks the bread in half and gives half to ABU, who started it
for food purposes. But ALADDIN looked up and saw two little children
foraging in the swamps. The girl sees it, that way
throws away the result and tries to hide it. So ALADDIN watches them
hurry, ani ABU.)
 
ABU: Uh-yeah!
 
(ABU takes a bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks away
giving a hand to the children. The girl throws her brother back.)
 
ALADDIN: Man, taa--a taa.
 
(The children giggle in delight. ABU tries to swallow his snot,
and blame you. She’s close to the kids and it’s hers
give them bread. They hit him on the head with a smile).
 
ABU: Ah, not so much. Or did he see her ?
 
(ABU sees ALADDIN walking in the sunshine where the parade is taking place
continues.He looks over ALADDIN'S shoulders. He's seeing it
PRINCE ACHMED is on horseback.)
 
STEP 1: On Palace Road, I think.
BYSTANDER 2: Another sucker for the princess.
 
(ALADDIN is startled by two little boys running out
in the street. A BOY runs in front of the PRINCE's house, .
it’s a miracle.)
 
PRINCE: Get out of my way, you dirty scum!
 
(PRINCE takes his whip and attacks the children, but ALADDIN
jumps in front of them and takes the beating.)
 
ALADDIN: Hey, if I were as rich as you, I'd buy some customs
PRINCE: Oh--I taught you some manners!
 
(The PRINCE pushes ALADDIN into the barn. The crowd laughs at him).
 
ALADDIN: Look, Abu. We don't see it every day a
a horse with two backs!
 
(The PRINCE turns and turns back to ALADDIN.)
 
PRINCE: You're a useless street dog. You were born a
street dog , you die street dog , that’s all
your dogs will take care of you.
 
(ALADDIN runs to the PRINCE, but the castle gates are locked
on his face.)
 
ALADDIN: I'm not fucking. And I don’t have dogs. Come
after which Abu. Let's go home.
 
(ALADDIN goes upstairs with a look, then hides
ABU night.)
 
ALADDIN: Riffraff, summoning mushrooms.
N t'o san.
If only they had watched closely
Are they a poor boy? Don’t be afraid.
They would know there was more to me.
 
(She pulls back a curtain to reveal the beauty of the palace).
 
One day Abu, things will change. We will be like that
rich people , live in palaces , never have problems
everyone should be.
 
(Click on the same picture in the sun. Cut to int. of SULTAN's room.
The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, passing
in the back of his pants.)
 
PRINCE: I've never been so embarrassed!
 
SULTAN: Oh, King Achmed. You won't leave so soon, are
juma?
 
PRINCE: Good luck marrying her!
 
SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine! Jasmine is doing well! Jasmine is doing well! (The SULTAN leaves
he went into the garden in search of his daughter. THE
is available, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE
pet tiger, who protects him. RAJAH is a symbol
and the PRINCE in his mouth undershorts.The SULTAN
took the cloth and removed it from the RAJAH's mouth.)
Change it, Rajah! Well, this is why Prince Achmed
it came out of a storm!
JASMINE: Oh, Daddy. The Rajah was playing with him,
you are not a Rajah. (The RAJAH came to accept it
JASMINE to pet and kiss him.) You were playing
the overdressed, self-indulgent King Achmed, .
isn't that a slap in the face? (She kisses her RAJAH, pleasuring herself
for a moment, until he looked angrily at his father. )
Ahem.
SULTAN: My dear, stop ignoring all suitors
he comes to the call. The law tells you.
BOTH: ...to marry a prince.
 
(They approach the dove).
 
SULTAN: Until your next birthday.
JASMINE: The law is wrong.
SULTAN: Three more days!
JASMINE: Dad, I hate being forced into that. (He takes it
a dove is born out of a cage.) When I am married, .
I want it out of love.
SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this rule. (He gave it to her
pigeon, he puts it back in the cage.) Not me
it's going to last forever, and I want to

JASMINE: Try to understand. I never did anything
own. (She waves her hand in the water
back, petting the fish.)I never really had
friends. (RAJAH smirks at him).
Unless like you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he returns
sleep.) I was never outside the palace
in the walls
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.
JASMINE: Well, maybe I don't want to be a princess. (THE
a ch'allt'asi.)
SULTAN: Oooohhh! May Allah have nothing in your hands
Phuchhanaka ye!
 
(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second. JASMINE dove
cage and the yanks open the door. The birds fly free.
He sees them leaving. The value of the int. To join the SULTAN's court.)
 
SULTAN: I don't know where he gets it. And they
it wasn’t nearly as choice. (An earthquake falls on him.
Looking surprised, he sees JAFAR.) Ooh, oh.
Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor. I want to be there
your knowledge is necessary.
JAFAR: My whole life is to serve you, sir. (He bows his head).
SULTAN: It's this pretender business. Jasmine didn’t do that
choose your husband. I came to my own understanding.
IAGO: (In Parrot voice) Aww! Wit's refused.
SULTAN: Oh, ha ha. A cookie, good polly! (THE
takes a cookie out of her pocket. IAGO looked up
they were still afraid. The SULTAN then fills in for IAGO
amount. IAGO blushes as he tries to eat. JAFAR'S FACEBOOK
and both SULTAN laugh.)
JAFAR: Surely your majesty has wonderful animals.
(IAGO looks up at him.) Now then maybe I can
divine a remedy for the intentional problem.
SULTAN: The only one who can help is you.
JAFAR: Ah, but I had to use mystical blue for that
diamond set diamond.
SULTAN: Uh, my ring? But it’s been in the family for generations
sanw.
JAFAR: The princess must have a mate.
(JAFAR uses the word 'princess' phonetically
the second word is "cess". He waves his wands
with the head of a cobra towards the SULTAN. His eyes are.
the rods began to glow. The room goes dark, and it’s JAFAR
the language goes deeper and deeper. The eyes of the SULTAN
looking mesmerized.) Don't worry. All
it will be fine.
SULTAN: Everything...will be fine.
JAFAR: That’s a diamond.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Everything you need will be fine.
 
(The SULTAN takes the ring and gives it to JAFAR. The horse returns
as normal JAFAR pushed the workers back.)
 
JAFAR: You are very fortunate, liege. Now run to.
play with your little toys.
SULTAN: (Still mesmerized) Yes...that's...very interesting.
 
(JAFAR and IAGO leave. We follow them. When they leave the room,
the parrot spits on the cookie.)
 
IAGO: I can't take it anymore! I have to be crazy about it
one more of those soft, disgusting cookies…bam!
Whack you!
 
(JAFAR pulls out a rope, revealing a hidden entrance to their house).
 
JAFAR: Calm down, Iago.
IAGO: Then I'll hold his head around. Whack is good! Whack is good!
JAFAR: (Addressing IAGO.) Soon, I'll be the sultan, won't I
addlepated twit ye.
IAGO: And then I put cookies in his throat! Ha
ha!
 
(The two go through a door and close it. Diss. to ext. gardens
at night. A dark man walked through it. We see it's JASMINE
he pretends to be . He reached the palace wall and began to climb it.
Thrown from behind by RAJAH.)
 
JASMINE: Oh, I mean, Rajah. But I can't stay here and.
made my life for me. I will miss you.(A
resumes his ascent, and is supported by his RAJAH,
which triggers coughing and sneezing.) Hello!
 
(He disappeared over the wall. By day in the street ALADDIN
and ABU gets capers again. They are up there.
fruit stand fabric.)
 
ALADDIN: Do it, Object. That's it!
 
(ABU dips slightly and looks at the BEAUTY.)
 
WAIT: (Passed by) Try this, sweethearts
they will dance and sing. (ABU is a melon and.
he's stuck there, changing his mood.) Hey, .
remove your legs.
ABU: Blah blah!
FIGURE: Why, oh! Get out of here, you filthy monkey!
 
(Takes the melon out of ABU. But first of all ALADDIN
he dives and pulls another melon from the stand.)
 
ABU: You guys!
 
(It zings back up. OWNER carries melon forward,
where it is placed on a hill. He looks confused, by the way
has just done so.)
 
ALADDIN: All right Abu. The breakfast is excellent.
 
(ALADDIN and ABU on the doorstep of the house eating a melon. J. we see
ASMINE walks down the aisle.)
 
STORE 1: Good lady, buy me some food. There is no better meal on a bike
walima wari.
BUTI 2: Sugar dates, date sugar and figs! Sugar
pistachio date!
STORE 3: Does the woman want a necklace. It’s beautiful
the necklace of a beautiful woman.
 
(He is mesmerized by the gesture, but impressed by the fish sting
on his face.)
 
SHOP 4: Fresh fish! We caught it, you bought it!
JASMINE: I don't think so. (He steps back, but fights back
fire-eater , he fears his own prey
fire.) Oh, excuse me. (Swallows, then vomits
fire comes out of the door. JASMINE is disgusting. Saw
happy to pat his stomach. ALADDIN sees it,
and a strange look came over his face.) I
it really hurts.
ALADDIN: (Obviously loving it.) Wow!
 
(She pulls the strap of her dress over her head. ABU sees her and.
his hand flying, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN'S
face.)
 
ABU: Uh oh. Hello? Hello?
 
(JASMINE stops at a fruit stand to see a homeless kid
to a fruit section. He takes one and gives it to her
juparu.)
 
JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. This is yours. (THE
the young man ran away.)
HOPE: You better pay for it.
JASMINE: (Mystified) Payna?
BOTTOM LINE: No one stole my bike!
JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry sir. I don't have any money.
JIGISƐN: Lunthata!
JASMINE: Please, if you'll let me go to the palace, I'll go
Get some from the Sultan.
HOPE: Do you know the penalty for theft?
 
(He takes her hand and pins it to the table, deliberately doing so
and cut off.)
 
JASMINE: No, not love!
 
(The sword falls, but his hand is silenced by ALADDIN'S).
 
ALADDIN: Thanks good sir. I want to be very happy
your. I was looking for you everywhere.
JASMINE: ( giggling) What are you doing?
ALADDIN: (chuckles back) Just kidding.
HOPE: Do you know this girl?
JASMINE: Most likely, yeah. She is my sister. It’s just a little bit
mad. (He wraps his arms around his ears.
It’s still amazing. HOPE seized him
ani jakite.)
BOTTOM: He says he knows Sultan!
ALADDIN: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
 
(ABU is picking up a bag. He hears this, then corrects himself.
JASMINE, playfully bowing to ABU.)
 
JASMINE: Oh, wise Sultan. How can I serve you?
ABU: Well, blah blah blah blah.
ALADDIN: Sad, isn't it? (She leans forward, picks it up
from a different apple cart than his own
foot.) However, there is no problem. (The procedure
Jasmine.) And now sis. It’s time to see
nurse.
JASMINE: (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello, Doctor.
How are you?
ALADDIN: No, no, no. It’s not just that. (To ABU, whose.
your pockets are squeezed.) Come, Sultan.
 
(ABU bows to the crowd and throws everything stolen into the cart
slang.)
 
REPRESENTATIVE: Is it good? What is the benefit ? (Which the ABU can review
take it, and the three escape.) Come back here, .
you little thieves!
 
(Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab. IAGO runs in gear in a strange way
contraption and accessories . On top of the contraption is a beer storm.)
 
IAGO: (huffing and puffing) With all due respect, yours
rotten, can we just wait for the real storm?
JAFAR: Breathe free, Iago. It’s much faster than that! (Saw...
The SULTAN ring is part of the contraption.)
IAGO: Yes, you mighty villain.
 
(IAGO runs fast. A bolt of lightning strikes in the ring, and passes
down to an hourglass. The sand began to rise.)
 
JAFAR: Ah, the sands of time--show me who can
into the hole. (The dust above is the Cave of.
Wonderful things. It throws a wind, but so
shows ALADDIN climbing a ladder , followed by
JASMINE is covered in clothes.) Yes, yes!
It’s where it’s at. My diamond is hard!
IAGO: Is that him?!?! He looks like a clown
are you waiting for it? (IAGO loses his leg and has a heart attack
engare mankutuw.)
JAFAR: Give the guards a call
masao, ɔnhɔn?
 
(IAGO runs through and bangs his head against the wall).
 
IAGO: That's only right.
 
(JAFAR laughs menacingly, the camera zooms in on the dust storm
There is ALADDIN. Finally we focus on the transformation of the real ALADDIN
up the stairs, followed by JASMINE.)
 
ALADDIN: Almost exactly.
 
(JASMINE goes up, but falls and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
It’s getting up.)
 
JASMINE: Thank you for protecting that man.
ALADDIN: Uh, forget it. (Grabs a stick.) So, uh, this
siɲɛ fɔlɔ sugukɛla, ɔnhɔn?
 
(ALADDIN uses the jump to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind).
 
JASMINE: So, obviously?
ALADDIN: Well, you're kind of famous. (He looked up at her,
with great affection. He turns his face back to her. But he is the one
he knows what he's doing, back to normal).
I mean, uh, you wouldn't know how dangerous it is
Agrabah would be it. (Creates a spreadsheet that.
let the horse walk him, but as he pleases
down, jumping on his head. He is looking back
suddenly. He threw the stick at her. Both
ALADDIN and ABU's eyes widen.)
JASMINE: I'm a fast learner.
ALADDIN: Of course. C'mon, this one. (They enter the room
a building, avoiding the boards and trusses themselves as they do
go away.) Whoa. Get your head in there. Be careful.
JASMINE: Is this where you live?
ALADDIN: Yes. I am with Abumpiki. Come, go as you please.
JASMINE: Very interesting.
ALADDIN: Well, not so, (pulls back the curtain and.
shows the palace) but there is an excellent view.
The palace looks great, doesn’t it?
JASMINE: Oh ye ye.
ALADDIN: I wonder what it's like living there, to
there are workers and employees…
JASMINE: Oh, of course. People who tell you where to go and how to get there
to dress in clothes.
ALADDIN: Much better than this place. Always stir food
and hang the guards.
JASMINE: You're not free to decide for yourself.
ALADDIN: Sometimes it's like-- .
JASMINE: You just--
BOTH: (in unison) --trap.
 
(Then they look at each other, and realize they're perfect for one person
certain. But ALADDIN realized where he was, and.
cure. He takes the apple from ABU's hand and rolls it into his
bolus woman JASMINE ta la.)
 
ALADDIN: So where did you come from?
JASMINE: What does it matter? I am running, not me
return .
ALADDIN: Really? (He takes a bite out of his own apple
hand , and give it to ABU , who is pleased
look at his face.)
ABU: We say yes!
 
(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE).
 
JASMINE: My father forced me to marry him.
ALADDIN: It's--it's terrible. (ABU appears later
the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!
 
(ABU runs to a higher place, cursing in conversation as he walks).
 
JASMINE: E dun?
ALADDIN: Abu said that--uh--that's not fair.
ABU: What is that?
JASMINE: Did he?
ALADDIN: Yes, of course.
JASMINE: Well, does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN: Well, uh, he wishes he could do something
rescue .
ABU: ¡Ay, wayna!
JASMINE: Hmm, tell her that's pretty cool.
 
(ALADDIN and JASMINE were pretty close, until now
ALADDIN leans in for a kiss. It is forbidden, however, .
THE GUARDS find them.)
 
GUARD: He's sorry!
ALADDIN and JASMINE: They got us! (Walker) U
o de kama?
JASMINE: My father sent them--
ALADDIN: Can you believe me?
JASMINE: E dun?
ALADDIN: Can you believe me? (He raises his hand)
JASMINE: He's a snake. (He takes it).
ALADDIN: Then fly!
 
(They both jump off the roof, falling down a snow bank. They.
try to move away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)
 
GUARD: Let's keep running, shall we, .
What is it like today?
 
(Again the PRINCESS'S turban is thrown by the ABU, but many of the guards are thrown
here and prevent output . The first GUARD heads off the ABU and.
threw it into a vase. Three more GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)
 
GUARD: The dungeon is you, boy.
ALADDIN: Hey, it depends on me!
JASMINE: Leave him alone.
GUARD: (Unaware she's a princess) Look what we saw
here he is, gentlemen--a street bike. (He throws it at her
jukɔrɔ.)
JASMINE: (stands up and unbuttons her jacket) .
Remove her hand, at the queen's command.
 
(GARDIN suddenly stops and bows, forcing ALADDIN to kneel).
 
GUARD: Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN: ¿Uka princesaxa ye?
ABU: (looking at the vase) Princess?
GUARD: What are you doing in the palace? And with that
aka calle rata?
JASMINE: That's none of your concern. Do as I say. Release
juparu!
GUARD: Well, I would, princess, but my orders are coming
Jafar is a great city. Take it with you.
 
(The GUARDS dismiss ALADDIN, bowing as they go).
 
JASMINE: (looking angry) Believe me, I believe it
with.
 
(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerges from his secret room. A
the door is discreetly closed, but the princess still comes
in before the end. He closes the door, pinning IAGO inside
a framed door.)
 
JASMINE: Jafar?
JAFAR: Oh, uh, princess.
IAGO: Aww! Jafar, n b'a siri!
JAFAR: How can I help you? (It's his.
layer, door magnet.)
JASMINE: The guards just took a guy out of the market, yours
rules.
JAFAR: Your father gave me the charge of keeping the peace
Agrabah is in the desert . The boy was a bad person.
JASMINE: What happened?
IAGO: You can't breathe, Jafar!
JAFAR: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.
IAGO: You're just--(JAFAR shoves him in again
closed door)--wow, that hurt!
JASMINE: He didn't hug me! I was running and running!
JAFAR: (Walking away in surprise) Oh, my dear! Oh, why not
it’s very moving. I knew that though.
JASMINE: What can I do?
JAFAR: By the way, the young man's sentence has already been completed
I'm sorry.
JASMINE: Any words?
JAFAR: (in an evil tone) Death. (JASMINE smiles).
Pʼeqe khuchhuqasa ye.
JASMINE: No! (He falls to the ground).
JAFAR: I'm sorry, princess.
JASMINE: How do you do it? (She runs out of the room crying).
 
(IAGO finally gets out the door. He gets out and runs
JAFAR hand, smile.)
 
IAGO: So how did it go?
JAFAR: I think he got it right. (Both of them are a
evil smiles appeared on their faces.)
 
(Diss. a JASMINE at night, beside the feast. RAJAH
it brings comfort. He's raising her.)
 
JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I wouldn't know
chacha.
 
(Cut to int. of dungeon. The mice fly, and we go down to see them
ALADDIN is chained to the wall.)
 
ALADDIN: (to himself) She's a princess. I don't believe in that
the. Maybe I sounded too soft to him.
ABU: (jayat) Oh-ho! Yala Aladin don wa? Aw ni baara!
 
(There is an ABU in the window above the dungeon).
 
ALADDIN: Abu! ¡This is the earth! Hey, c'mon--please help me out with these.
 
(ABU stops, then starts talking wildly, and falls to the ground. He.
he covers his head with a cloth and covers his eyes with a.
the example of the princess.)
 
ALADDIN: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, it’s so good.
 
(ABU jumps into ALADDIN's arms and pulls out a small tool
out of his pocket, saving ALADDIN.)
 
ABU: Jïsa, jïsa, jïsa.
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Abu. I will never see him again. I'm going to have a
street rat, remember, and there is a law. He is the one who is
gotta marry a prince, she deserves it.
 
(ABU finally frees ALADDIN's arms).
 
ABU: O de don!
ALADDIN: (Slaps his fingers) I'm a--I'm a fool
CONT: You'd be a fool to just give up, boy.
 
(We see a REAL MAN sitting in the corner who is not ALADDIN and ABU
they had seen it before.)
 
ALADDIN: Who are you?
INSIDE: A small prisoner, like you. But together,
perhaps more than that.
ALADDIN: I'm listening.
NOW: There's a hole, boy. A mountain of miracles. Compliment
with riches beyond your wildest dreams.
A treasure to impress your princess, I would be
making a bet.
 
(The audience will notice that NOW he is speaking
'princess' is like "prin-CESS", not a standard pronunciation
and "PRIN-cess" . THE little man backs away, and IAGO kicks him
head from JAFAR's "heart man" hideout.)
 
IAGO: Jafar, is it faster? I'm dying right here!
ALADDIN: But the law says only a king can marry--
INSIDE: You heard the golden rule, didn't you boy?
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(Laughs,
indicating a terrible door.)
ALADDIN: Then why tell me all that in detail
wealth with me?
FACT: I want a man with heavy legs, a strong man
to enter afterwards.
ALADDIN: Ah, trouble. It’s outside, are we here?
 
(BA approaches a wall, opening a hidden exit).
 
SWEET MAN: Mmm, mmm, mmm., Things are not always what they seem
as. So do we have a deal?
 
(ALADDIN looks at ABU and shakes his head).
 
ABU: Oh, hmm.
 
(Cut to the forest. ALADDIN leads the horse away.
Small PEOPLE with ABU on it. Diss. to the mountain of wonders.)
 
DUNK: Who disturbs my sleep?
ALADDIN: That's me, Aladdin.
HEART: Let's move on. Do not touch anything but the lamp.
 
(The pit opens with a loud crash, and a staircase appears in front of you
His name is ALADDIN. )
 
THIS IS: Remember, boy--bring me the lantern first, and then
you will get your reward.
ALADDIN: C'mon, Abu. (Hiding ABU under hand
with his jacket.)
 
(ALADDIN starts down the stairs. He reaches the floor
He entered a golden room full of treasures.)
 
ALADDIN: Can you look at that!
ABU: Oh yes!
ALADDIN: Few things make me rich
than the sultan!
 
(ABU looks around, sees treasure, and then looks for rings).
 
ALADDIN: ¡Abu!
 
(ABU stops in mid-run, rolling on a rug on the floor).
 
ALADDIN: Don't...touch...it! We need to find a lamp.
 
(They start to make their way across the room as ALFORMA gets up
leaves the field and begins to follow them. ABU gets that feeling
they are suffering.)
 
ABU: Is it correct?
 
(She turns around, ALFORMA hits the floor. She continues, and.
and ALFORMA resumed the pursuit. Again, the ABU pushed back, however.
JOY is curled up and covered with a bunch of treasures. ABU
ran to ALADDIN and dropped his trouser leg.)
 
ABU: Aladdin is good! Aladdin is great!
ALADDIN: Abu, may you be shown to whom?
 
(Again CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns it is a carpet
then jumps to the other side. It can be taken down with a tassel and pulled
ABU is interesting. When ABU turns around, ALFORMA goes to the other again
edge. This time ABU got down to karate. ALFORMA can
got down and took off ABU's clothes and put them on himself. ABU is installed
thought for a second, until ALPHONITE pointed to a tassel in front of him
face. Both ABU and CARPET jump in fear, and run away. The ABU tackles
Then ALADDIN turns his head to look at ALFORMA.)
 
ALADDIN: Abu, what are you--crazy?
 
(ALFORMA looks behind a pile of treasures).
 
ALADDIN: A magic carpet! C'mon yeah. C'mon get over it. I'm going to do that
it hurts your heart too.
 
(ALFORMA emerges slowly, shyly, taking ABU's hat and dust
it is killed He runs towards ALADDIN and hands the cloak to the nearest ABU
he. cried ABU, leaping into ALADDIN's arms.)
 
ALADDIN: That's right, Abu. It won’t snore.
 
(ALFORMA takes ABU's cloak again and hands it to him. ABU shakes it off
his hand screaming at her. ALFORMA starts to go, "sad.")
 
ALADDIN: Hey, wait a minute. Don’t go to the gym. Maybe you can help
our. (ALFORMA looks back with a smile. Then she runs off
circling the two of them.) Hey, whoa! YOU
look, we're trying to find this lamp. (RUG
and clues for them to follow.) I think he knows that
wherever available.
 
(They go through a big hole until a big man comes out
the hole in the floor. In the middle of the room is a large pillar,
with a ladder to climb. Water surrounds him
the boundary of dissimilar stones. At the top of the list
the pillar is the light source. ALADDIN begins to cut the bridge.)
 
ALADDIN: Wait for it!
ABU: Oh. Or did he see her ?
 
(ABU is a temple with a golden monkey. The long legs are a.
large ruby-like ones . ABU is a hypnotic response . ALADDIN is.
escalator speed . CARPET saw ABU, grabbed his heart and tried in vain
in order to protect it. ALADDIN finally gets the MAGIC LAMP.)
 
ALADDIN: Is this it? This is where we come all the way
here-- (Looks down to see ABU free
of the CARPET to hold and lunge towards the stone.) Abu- .
DO IT!
 
(ABU grabs the stone. Bang is used to start the room
thalsuña.)
 
HEARTBREAK: Unbelievers!
ABU: Oh yes!
HEART WORD: You have touched the forbidden treasure. (ABU.) and so on
repositions the stone , but it is a stone
and the temple turned to lava.) Now e
never see the light of day again!
 
(ALADDIN runs down the steps, but they fall on a ledge, a.
it descends into the sky until it floats in the air. The water is gone
these. As he pulls towards her, suddenly ALFORMA appears
catch. ABU is standing on a cliff
bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks melting into lava.
Then ALFORNA fled, and ALADDIN seized her, as the last stone would seize her
he is screaming.)
 
ALADDIN: Well done! Tapi, let's go!
 
(They run together in ditches, dodging and slipping through walls
trash. ABU grabbed ALADDIN's head and rubbed his eyes.)
 
ALADDIN: Abu, this is no time for fear! (Pulls out the ABU
sees them run into his head and a wall.)
You start to panic.
 
(ALFORMA takes the wave, and then to another cave. Eventually, they.
bɔ knɛma dondaw fɛ. It's raining, it's raining
hard and approachable. ALFORMA and the company are up near the top with a
the stone falls on the carpet and puts it on the floor. ALADDIN caught it
stone wall and hold. He sees NOW from above,
and proximity.)
 
ALADDIN: Help!
INSIDE: Throw me a light!
ALADDIN: I don't catch it. Give me your hand.
NINE: Give me the lamp first!
 
(ALADDIN reaches out and takes out the MAGIC LAMP. He turns it on, a
nd NOW raises it above his head.)
 
Npogotiginin: Ha ha ha ha! Neither! to laban! Ha ha ha ha!
 
(ALADDIN leaves with ABU's help. But SANI
FOOD pushes ABU aside and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)
 
ALADDIN: What are you doing?
FACT: Giving you a reward. (JAFAR returns to his place
normal voice.) Give you eternal reward.
 
(He pulls out a raised dagger, almost stabbing ALADDIN, when.
ABU bit his finger. She screams, but ALADDIN,
which falls into the pit. THE BOY throws ABU into the pit as
Ok. They believe in them. CARPET sees that, but a
the large stone. It is a struggle to escape, and to survive. He runs away
to capture ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times
seasons, and confusion. At the top, the hole just explodes
one last time, and then down again. JAFAR runs away
W does some things.)
 
JAFAR: Nothing! That's what I have. It’s all mine! I (He won’t be able to
has it in his pocket)--- where is it? No, DON'T!!
 
(The kiss fades to JASMINE'S bedroom. She sits on the couch, finally
RAJAH to the one who looks sad. of the SULTAN.)
 
SULTAN: Jasmina? Oh, my dear brother. What is the wrong thing?
JASMINE: Jafar...it's...terrible. (THE
she looked like she was crying.)
SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--let's arrange it that way.
Now tell me everything.
 
(Cut to int. of cave. ALADDIN lies in his mind on BUCKET.
ABU tries to wake him up.)
 
ABU: Oh, oh. Is it Aladdin? Develop. Aladdin is a brother.
 
(ALFORMA gets up, lifts ALADDIN. He gets up slowly).
 
ALADDIN: Oh, my brain. (Looking at the locked entrance).
We were caught. (Annoyed, wringing his hands
don) That two-faced boy! (Calmly) .
Whoever he was, he carried the torch with him long ago.
ABU: Aha!
 
(ABU takes the MAGIC LAMP.)
 
ALADDIN: Why, you bald monkey! Therefore, a
beaten, useless scraps. Hey, I think so
something has been written here , but it is difficult
make out (to come out).
 
(He switches on the LAMP. Immediately smoke comes out of the hole, which.
THE LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN catches it
LAMP, and our good friend, GENIE out.)
 
GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! OY! Ten thousand years ago ya
such a cricket in the neck! (She hands him ALADDIN
the nearby stone. Then he lifts his head and turns away
circling it, screaming while doing so. ALFORMA a
ALADDIN above.) Wow! Is it okay to be like that
it's out ! (GENIE uses its own lamp head
a microphone.) It’s nice to be back, ladies and
women and men. Hi, where are ya? (Stick to the microphone
ALADDIN'S face.) What's your name?
ALADDIN: Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.
GENIE: (He says her name as if he's got something
major) Aladdin! (A neon sign flashes
It had the name ALADDIN surrounded by a series of lanterns. THE
the sign changes for the next line in GENIE.)
Good morning, Aladdin. It’s great to have you on the show. Can
we've got 'Al?' I call you man. Or maybe 'Din?'. maybe he was just saying. Or how about it
bout 'Wild?' they are called. (GENIE disappears, then a dog disappears
wrapped in plaid he jumps in.) 'Akankiwa, wayi!
¡C'mon, Laddi!' Sisan.
ALADDIN: (Shakes his head) I hit my head harder
more than I expected.
GENIE: (Still flying) Do you smoke? Thoughts for me? (Dog
poofs into smoke, then returns to GENIE. ABU
screeches wildly.) Oh, sorry Cheetah--wait for me
he didn't sing that stick! Hey, it’s Rugman! I don't see it
you guys in a few thousand years! Hit me up with some tassels! I'm going to go!
Than! (ALFORMA runs through and high fives GENIE.
GENIE turns to ALADDIN.) Suppose you are short
than my last master. (He holds his beer can.) Or
that's it or I'm growing up. Check out the details
aside--does my face look different to you?
ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I--your master?
GENIE: (puts diploma on ALADDIN's shoulder and a
mortar head.) That’s right! He can do that
to practice!! What do you want from me, (like Arnold
Schwarzenegger) is always amazing,(inside a
bucket) for a long time, (as in a ventriloquist
a mannequin) reads repeatedly, (pushes mannequin aside) .
but never in sequence--
 
(He surpasses the many GENIUSES that surround him.)
 
The DUP slowly . GENIUS: Duplicate, duplicate, duplicate.
duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate.
duplicates, duplicates, tab-tab .
GENIE: (He says it like a ring announcer in boxing).
Genie is the best! Of! Lamp on the lamp! (Inserted in ed.).
Sullivan) Straight lamp here, right
this is your pleasure to accomplish my will .
Thank you ceuuuu!
ALADDIN: Well done! Do you want to be fulfilled?
GENIE: Three wishes must be fulfilled exactly. And the ix-nay
seeking more desire. (Enter somewhere
machine, manual and three GENIE
windows.) If--three. (See GENIE
knights out of slot.) Uno, dos, tres.
(Changed b/w Groucho Marx.) No
barter, exchange or refund . (Hundred
which mysteriously translates into the word "Refunds'".
ALADDIN: (to ABU) Now I know I dreamed.
GENIE: (Music begins "Friend like me") Lord, not me
I think I understand what we are getting at here! So
why don't you make the stones while I light it
maybe. (GENIE is a.
reflective light) .
 
Well Ali Baba got forty robbers against them
Scheherazadie had a thousand stories
aw master i ka chance 'cause up i manga
You have a magic journey that never ends!
 
(GENIE creates 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
The GENIE appeared in a jacket, then put out his hands and put them in the box
thieves must obey.)
 
You have some strength in your corner now
There is some great ammo in your camp
You get some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
Here's what you have to do, turn on that light
And I'm going to say it
 
(The boxing ring appears, ALADDIN is in the corner, being massaged
Created by GENIE. The GENIE then turns into a pile of fireworks and.
he shouted. The GENIE then emerges from under the lamp and grabs ALADDIN's lamp
his hand is on the lamp.)
 
Mr. Aladdin's brother
What will that excitement be?
I'll take your order, write
You never have a friend like me
No, no, no, no!
 
(GENIE pulls out tables and chairs, then throws things a.
notes, a chef . )
 
Life is your kitchen
And my maitre' d!
C'mon whisper whatever you like
You never have a friend like me.
 
(GENIE appears as a meat dish, then returns to normal,
but he dilates his ears to hear ALADDIN. Finally, it explodes
into four identical GENIEs.)
 
Yes sir, we take pride in the service
speaks chief, king, shah!
What you want to say is yours! The real food
How about some more baklava?
 
(The GENIES give him a haircut, a haircut and a manicure, followed by ALADDIN
is seen surrounded by a comfortable chair (eh?) with property
and fixation in women. GENIE appears full
ekran ni baklava.)
 
Try some in column 'A'.
See all columns of 'B' .
I want to help you dude
You never have a friend like me
 
(ALADDIN mounts a pile of food, with a capital A written on it,
then jump to another column with B on top. He’s a lifter
and captured by the electrical power of the GENIE. He opens his mouth, .
the mouth is arched. A little GENIE
comes out dressed as a magician.)
 
(Mini GENIE also does a little dance with GENIE's two big guys
on the hands. Finally, roll the mini GENIE around and squeeze it
it makes it nothing.)
 
Can your friends do that?
Do your friends do that?
Did your friends pull this kid out of his hat
Your friends can go poof!
Nice looky yan
If your friends can go to Abracadabra, let 'er rip
And then your heart rate drops?
 
(GENIE takes it out of her head, duplicates it, and juggles it.
He throws it at ALADDIN, who juggles him with one arm around him
a basketball-shaped head in the palm of your hand. It’s a toss
he goes back to the GENIE, who steps up and tries to throw
he even came out of a cloth in his mouth. It spins and spins
until it becomes a small white powder. The rabbit changes
a brown snake (very reminiscent of Figment at EPCOT Center).
The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,
who dance around ALADDIN. When he began to enjoy them, .
u tununna.)
 
So don’t sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
I am here to answer all your lunch prayers
You've got it bona fide, certified
You got genius in a role? d'affairs is welcome!
I wanted to help you
So I really want to know what you want
A desire three miles away, no doubt
So just scratch it, and oh!
 
 
(GENIE imitates ALADDIN, then a
the witness turns to ALADDIN. GENIE said:
a list {written in Arabic} appears in the ears of ALADDIN , which he uses
patting his neck as he dried off after washing.)
 
Mr. Aladdin, sir, you have one wish or two or three wishes
I am at work, you great nabob
You never have a friend, you never have a friend
I tɛ teri sɔrɔ abada, i tɛ teri sɔrɔ
You've never...had... a... friend... like me!
You don't have a friend like me!
 
(HAREM The dancing girls reappear, and ALADDIN leans down to kiss one of them.
He turns into a GENIE who zaps four familiar wolves
life. On the other hand, he zaps four camels, .
and a grand finale musical number. ABU also carries gold
at its best, but GENIE connects everything to the rainbow and.
zaps it away until everyone is back in the cave. GENIE is a
neon "APLAUSE" sign in the background. ABU rolled up his clothes and.
feels empty.)
 
GENIE: So what's up, Sir?
ALADDIN: What three wishes will you grant me?
GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. Exist
damadɔw dira, damadɔw mun ye jɔn ye
ALADDIN: How is it?
GENIE: Ah, first rule: You can't kill anyone. (THE
cuts off his head with his hand.) So don't do that
ask. Rule number two: I cannot make anyone fall in love
with another person. (The head becomes a large hat
lips that kiss ALADDIN.) You little puny, there.
(Grief sleeps, then wakes up and a
zombie.) Rule Three: You can’t bring people back
suw suw. Not a pretty picture, (She restrains herself
ALADDIN shakes him then) I don't like doing it! (THE
poofs back to normal.) Otherwise, you get it

ALADDIN: (looking at ABU like a plot) Ah, provisos? HE
does that mean restrictions? About desires? (to ABU) In all cases
powerful wise--you can't turn people away

GENIE: Excuse me? You're looking at it

did you bring me here ? And suddenly, i

to be able to travel long distances. The value of the int. IN THE SULTAN'S HOUSE. JAFAR'S
Includes IAGO, JASMINE and SULTAN.)
 
SULTAN: Jafar, this is painful. If it wasn’t for everyone

You should discuss the prison sentence with me .
before they cut off the head.
JAFAR: I'm telling you, be proud, it won't happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, let's get this all right now
business is behind us. Please?
JAFAR: As my most profound and humble apologies
well done, princess. (She kisses his hand, but...
he is also a yank.)
JASMINE: There will be some benefit to my obligation
marriage. If I am the queen, o.
it’s hard to get rid of you.
SULTAN: That’s good. Everyone was seated, that way. Now, Jasmine, .
to return to this pretender's business, (a
he looks up to see Jasmine coming out) Jasmine?
Jasmine is doing well! (He runs after her).
JAFAR: If only I had a flashlight!
IAGO: (as JASMINE) I'm strong enough to save myself
you! D'oh yeah! For example--let's keep kissing
until that chump, and for the chump's daughter
for the rest of our lives.
JAFAR: No, Iago. Just until you find a chump guy.
Then he will see us banished--or beheaded!
PANI: ¡Eeewww!
IAGO: (Thinking) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Is that Jafar? What if you were a chump guy?
JAFAR: (Looking down at IAGO) What?
IAGO: Well, you married the princess,okay? Then, uh, .
you have become a sultan!
JAFAR: Oh!Fuck the moss? I became a sultan. There is an idea

IAGO: Yes, merit! Than! And then the dad-in-law soul.

JAFAR: Iago, I love how your dirty little mind works!

sagasogo.)
 
GENIE: Well, don't you think you're a sheep? It's good, e
baaaaad boy, but no more freebies.
ALADDIN: Well done. Well, three wishes. I wish they were
Very. (to GENIE) What do you want?

GENIE: Is it me? Nobody's ever asked me that before. Thus, the in

Itty bitty salon
ALADDIN: Genie, that's awful.

should go "Poof! What do you want to do? Poof! What do you have to do."
do you want to? Poof yeah! What do you want?" To be myself

here. That won’t happen. Genie, rise to the occasion.

GENIE: Well, this is hopin'. (She shakes ALADDIN'S hand).
OK Let’s do some magic! (Now a

ALADDIN: Come on, I'm going to hug you--

ABU: Oh yes!

The entrance to Agrabah roads is wider

it’s a science! (One door carries the head of a GENIE

GENIE doesn't know.) Mmm, not necessarily. (It’s his own
hands and ABU form a beautiful white horse.)
It’s very difficult. Let's take a look. What do you have to do?

The forest naturally returns to the earth, where ABU

ALADDIN: Abu, you are very sweet.

we are not finished yet. Hang up your hat, .
little one, because we're going to make you a star!

SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all suitors! (He tries to

away. SULTAN inadvertently drops the biscuit
back.) How can you choose someone who hates it?
(IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly a

SULTAN: What is that? Who?

JAFAR: Troubled times require troublesome solutions, me

Jafar., you have to come and see this!
 
(We see a parade moving forward, led by what appears to be a GENIE
human nature is BIG.)
 
MARCHERS: Make way for Prince Ali!
SWORDMAN: Say hey! That’s Prince Ali!
BIG: Hey, clear the way at the old bazaar,
Hey you, let's get through, it's a bright new star,
Come now, and meet his eye for the first time on your block!
Make your way, here he comes,
Playing battles, playing drums.
You love this guy
 
(Great man fighting between different characters.)
 
Prince Ali, fabulous he is, Ali Dogs!
Please feel free, show some respect
Getting down on one knee
 
(ABU the lion walks through the city, carrying ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.)
 
Try not to worry too much now
Dimansi burusi is Salaam
And come to meet his strange coterie.
 
(IAGO dances to the tune while JAFAR looks on. The.
HUGE six-person "wheelchairs" climb the trunk of the ABU. They are being built
in each other's arms as ALI shakes hands.)
 
Prince Ali, thank you, Ali Ababwa!
He's as strong as a regular guy ten, really
It was aimed at a fleeing crowd
A hundred villains with swords
Who sent these goons to their masters, why Prince Ali!
 
(In ALI, the battery fails, but lightning strikes a GENIE (tm) country

and recites the last two lines to the audience.)
 
MEN'S CORPS:(Takes the camels) He's got seventy-five golden camels!

HARRY: Don't they look lovely, June?

When it comes to different animals
He has a zoo, I tell you
It’s a world class menagerie!
 
(GENIE comes in like a rabbit, then like a goat, and says the last two words

where three HAREM Girls are accompanied by a HAREM GENIE.)
 
GENIUS: 1.1. Bamako, Mali.
GIRL: (on couterpoint) .
Prince Ali, Beautiful him, Ali Ababwa
There's no question this Alix is ​​attractive
Body, how can I talk
It’s never ordinary, it’s never boring
Weak in the knees
Everything about the guy is amazing
So get out there
He’s amazing, he’s a whiz, he’s amazing
Adjust your blanket and get ready
He will cut my hair out
Gawk me grovel you Prince Ali!
And I love how she dresses!
 
(JASMINE looks out from the palace balcony. A.
he smirks, and walks away.)
 
CHORUS: He has ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
(He got the monkeys, look at the monkeys!)
And it doesn't cost you anything to notice them!
(He’s generous, by the way)
Slaves want it, servants and flunkies want it!
(It’s an honor to serve him)
They bow to his will, they love to serve him
They are mixed with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali is that!
 
(ALADDIN throws gold coins at the crowd, who quickly approach him
let us look at these . ABU with the parade on foot.
palace and interior. THE SULTAN runs to the door
to the throne room, but JAFAR is standing in front of the door.
Suddenly it breaks down, and ABU takes the lead, destroying it
JAFAR and IAGO are behind the door.)
 
GENIE: Prince Ali ye !
Amorous is he! Ali Dogs
Your princess dressed up was such a sight we loved seeing!

He went there and turned himself into a doll
Sixty elephants, llamas galore

With their forty fakirs, cooks and bakers
Its eggs flutter in the chili
Make way for Prince Ali!
 
(Very slow until ALADDIN jumps off ABU's neck
then the MAGIC CARPET runs into the SULTAN. JAFAR is a little younger
the door is closed.)
 
SULTAN: (Applause) Splendid, absolutely amazing.
ALADDIN: (In a deep voice.) Ahem. Your Majesty, I have
I have come from far away to seek your daughter's hand.
SULTAN: Prince Ali's Dogs! Very. I am very happy with the results

JAFAR: (Very dry) Ecstatic. I'm afraid, Prince
Abooboo--
ALADDIN: --A few!
JAFAR: Whatever. You can’t just parade here without an invitation
and to wait--
SULTAN: ...Thank Allah, this is a miraculous device.
(He pulled the feathers, and they became his
mustache.) I don’t think I can do that.
ALADDIN: Why indeed, Your Majesty. Please answer me.
 
(He helps the SULTAN into the ALFORMA, which he plops on the floor.
JAFAR crawls into the CARPETS and rolls to the floor.)
 
JAFAR: Sir, I have to advise you on this--
SULTAN: --Oh, look at your buttons, Jafar. Learn to have some fun.
 
(Throws sticks at ALFORNA and SULTAN escape. IAGO, min
he stood at the end of the pole , and fell , several times
bopping the rod with his lips as he landed. SULTAN is.
ALFORMA flies up under the sky, and attacks with a drop bomb,
Run into the ABU, and scare him. The race is in progress
in the background, and JAFAR and ALI speak in the foreground.)
 
JAFAR: Or where did you say you came from?
ALADDIN: Oh, you're quick, I'm sure.
(Laughs. JAFAR does not).
JAFAR: Please try. (IAGO lands on the staff.)
SULTAN: Look, Polly!
 
(Everyone ducks in time as ALFORMA gets cents for their.
the leaders of the country. CARPET returns and SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)
 
IAGO: Hey, be careful. Look with that sweet rug!
 
(ALFORMA zooms in on IAGO, who wipes his nose proudly, and.
focus on a pillar. He ran to the floor, and his head
are surrounded by little SULTANS on Carpets, saying, "Have a Graller,
to get a cookie. The real SULTAN begins his final journey.)
 
SULTAN: Out of the way, I enter the country. Jafar , 1999 .

JAFAR: Wonderful, congratulations.
SULTAN: Ooh, lovely. Yes, I seem to have some talent

JAFAR: I'm not sure, sir.
SULTAN: Bad words. One thing I am proud of Jafar, me
the best judge of man.
IAGO: Oh, good judge, yes, of course...no!!!
 
(JASMINE enters quietly).
 
SULTAN: Jasmine likes this!
ALADDIN: And I love princess Jasmine already!
JAFAR: Your Lordship, no. I have to pray for Jasmine
ingredients. (JASMINE gets angry.) Here
the boy is no different. What's going on
do you think she is fit for a princess?
ALADDIN: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (She snorts
JAFAR's goat, which is all out
directions.) Just talk to me. I want to win

JASMINE: How dare you! (Everyone looks shocked).
All of you, do you stop to decide the future? I

SULTAN: Oh, my dear. Don’t worry, Prince Ali. Please give it to him
Jasmine weather is cool. (They left).
JAFAR: I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince
Abooboo is a skeleton .
 
(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night. We lift to find her
ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)
 
ALADDIN: What should I do? Jasmine didn't miss me either
you need to talk to him. I had to know I couldn't be wrong

GENIE: (to the carpet, playing chess) So go ahead! (ALFORMA box,
a black dot falls off the board.) Hey.
That's a good move. (as Rodney Dangerfield) I
can't believe it--I lost it with the rug.
ALADDIN: Genie, I need help.
GENIE: (as Jack Nicholson) Well, sparkle, this is it.

to be a true warrior, did ya follow?
ALADDIN: Where are we?
GENIE: (Returns to normal, putting on mortar board. Pointing
takes words from a board) Tell him
the...TRUE!!!
ALADDIN: That's not it! When Jasmine found out I was actually a bit of a person
crummy street rat, he was laughing at me. (THE
she wears a dress, which shines like a GENIUS.)
GENIE: A woman appreciates a man who makes her happy!
(ALADDIN turns off the light and throws the chain.
GENIE comes out in real clothes.) Al, everyone
joking aside, you really have to find yourself.
ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing. Ok,
I'm going to see him. I feel good, I feel cold, .
sure. How are you doing?
GENIE: (Sadly) Like a king.
 
(ALADDIN runs to SAGANA's balcony. JASMINE is in bed,
and his greatness . RAJAH is next to him.)
 
ALADDIN: (From the wrong side) Princess Jasmine?
 
(RAJAH looks up and sighs).
 
JASMINE: Is anyone there?
ALADDIN: N--Prince Ali. Ahem--(She jumped into her own
on the inside) King Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE: I don't want to see you.
ALADDIN: No, no, princess. Give me a chance. (RAJAH is a man
he grinned and advanced towards her.)
JAFAR: Just leave me alone.
ALADDIN: ¡Alayax kititɛso!
 
(From the top of the balcony, the CARPET looks down with the GENIUS.)
 
GENIE: How about our beau?
 
(ALFORMA crosses her throat with her hand).
 
ALADDIN: Good kitchen, get up. It's a stretch. (He gets up
and the turban the bruise the RAJAH.)
JASMINE: (She looks at him and says she saw him
first.) Wait, wait. Do I know you guys?
ALADDIN: (Ripping his hat quickly) Uh, no, no.
JASMINE: You remind me of someone I met at the market.
ALADDIN: The market? (A bee makes a noise in his head).
I have employees who market for me.
Why do I even have market staff
for the sake of the servants, therefore I cannot be with you.
u donna late can.
JASMINE: (Looking disappointed.) No, I don't think so.
BEE: (It's a GENIUS) He should mention you, Casanova. Talk
let's talk about it ! She’s smart, she’s happy, her hair, her eyes.
Whatever--pick an action!
ALADDIN: Um, Princess Jasmine? You are still there.
ABJE: Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, right time!
ALADDIN: Just in time!
JASMINE: On time?
BEE: That’s right.
ALADDIN: Very interesting.
BEE: Good treatment.
JASMINE: That’s a little bit. I'm rich, you know.
ALADDIN: Oh my!
JASMINE: The daughter of a Sultan
ALADDIN: It was her poem.
JASMINE: A nice prize for any royal wedding.
ALADDIN: Uh, of course. Ok. A king like me.
BEE: (Whispering in her ear) Understanding! Communication!
JASMINE: Of course, a prince like you. And all the other stuffed shirts, .
swaggering, peacock n b'a dɔn!

Let it be a day!
JASMINE: Just go jump off a balcony! (He gets up and leaves) .
ALADDIN: Where are we?
BEE: Stop it! Please protect it! Do you want me to fuck her?

ALADDIN: Yes, of course!

to connect.) Now go. (THE
climbs the stairs.)
JASMINE: No!
ALADDIN: (Shakes his head) What? What?
JASMINE: (Surprised) How--how do you do that?
(Looks up to see ALFORMA).
ALADDIN: A ka tapi magic.
JASMINE: That’s lovely. (ALFORMA pats JASMINE's shoulder
tassel.)
ALADDIN: You, uh, you don't want to drive, do you?
Get out of the palace, and see the world.
JASMINE: Isn't it dangerous?
ALADDIN: Of course. Can you trust me?
JASMINE: (Just that-
line value) What?
ALADDIN: (Raises his hand as before) You trust me
nayaru?
JASMINE: (Seeing a smile on her face) Yeah.
 
(She takes his hand and turns it onto ALFORMA. He zooms up,
throwing them both into chairs. The music was called “A Whole”.
New World" swollen. JASMINE looked back and saw RAJAH watching
he looked at her curiously. He smiles as they run over the palace
into the wall and into the sky.)
 
ALADDIN: I can show you the world
It’s bright, shiny, and beautiful.
Princess tell me, now how long did you stay
Should your heart decide?
 
(ALFORMA zooms through the city, pausing a
flower. She gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.
It’s funny.)
 
I can open your eyes
Surprise you with wonder
Top, sides and bottom
On a carpet magic journey
 
 
(ALFORMA acts as ALADDIN sings, then magnifies the clouds).
 
The new world!
But kura fantastic point of view
No one is saying no
Or wherever you go
Or suppose we are dreaming
 
(SMILE He looks back and sees that Agrabah has disappeared from view. ALFORMINA
flies through the clouds and out of the clouds.)
 
JASMINE: A new era
An amazing place I never knew
But when you get here
It’s very clear
I am in a new world with you now!
 
ALADDIN: I'm in a new world with you now!
 
(Each holds a small cloud as ALFORMA continues to fly. She.
it then revolves around a stationary cloud in which it represents ascension.)
 
JASMINE: Incredible views
An indescribable feeling
Laughing, falling, freewheeling
Through the infinite diamond sky
 
(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks very scary
and vomiting. ALFORMA does somersaults and flips, sometimes inserted
ALADDIN and JASMINE free-fall, but they're caught. They are and
honor above the clouds, where the starry night awaits them.)
 
JASMINE: A whole new world!
ALADDIN: Don't you dare open your eyes
JASMINE: There are a hundred thousand different things to see
ALADDIN: Hold your breath--you better!
JASMINE: I feel like a shooting star,
I have come a long way
I can’t go back to where I was before!
 
(They zoom in on a river, apparently the Nile, which is.
The ship includes the Great Pyramid . They shake hands with an employee
The whole face of the sphinx. But, it’s funny
excessively stretched and breaks the first part of the eye.)
 
ALADDIN: A new world!
JASMINE: Every change is amazing
ALADDIN: With new horizons to follow
JASMINE: Anytime, red letter
 
(They run towards the runaway wild horses. JASMINE pets one of them).
 
BOTH: I follow them somewhere
There is time for that
Let me share this whole new world with you
 
A new era
That is where we are
 
(They escape through Greece, where ALADDIN finds an apple
tree and waves to JASMINE , who is now safe
he should be dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)
 
ALADDIN: Interesting to follow
JASMINE: Wonderful place
PANI: Me and you!
 
(ALFORMA floats on a pond, and we see the light of the pond
the moon is in the middle of the ocean. Fireworks exploded and we saw a couple
sitting on the roof during Chinese New Year.)
 
JASMINE: It's all wonderful.
ALADDIN: Yes.
JASMINE: (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
It is a shame Abu had to miss this .
ALADDIN: Not at all. He hates fireworks. (ALFORMA looks up
to find out what’s going on.) He doesn’t really think that way
such as aviation. (And now ALADDIN understands)
That's...oh no yeah!
JASMINE: (Takes off her turban) What a man you are.
commercial! I know that's it. Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, n b'a fò.
JASMINE: You thought I was stupid?
ALADDIN: Yes!
JASMINE: I can't imagine that?
ALADDIN: No, I mean, I hoped you wouldn't. No, it is not
what I meant to say.
JASMINE: Who are you? Tell us the truth!
ALADDIN: Really? (She looks at the CARPET which she puts her hand on,
stop hoping.) The truth...the truth is...for me
sometimes they dress like a commoner to run
the pressures of palace life. (ALFORMA rises upwards
defeat.) But of course I am king! (This penny.
his veil is pulled over his eyes.)
JASMINE: Why don't you just tell me?
ALADDIN: Well, you know, um...kings come out
marque in disguise, sounds a bit odd, .
don't you understand?
JASMINE: Not surprising.
 
(She touches her pen and holds it. ALFORMA is a

on the palace porch where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. RUG
takes a step down. Then ALADDIN came down
on the balcony just below.)
 
JASMINE: Goodnight, my beautiful prince.
ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.
 
(They slowly lean forward for a kiss, but ALFORMA knocks him out and they.
kiss her sooner than expected. He went slowly back to.
he's looking at it. Finally, he enters the room through the curtain.)
 
ALADDIN: Yes! (He returns to ALFORMA and descends
to the floor.) For the first time in my life, .
things are starting to move forward.
 
(Jasmine looks at her porch, grabbed by four arms).
 
ALADDIN: Hey yeah! What? (A gag is attached to his mouth.
Muffled voice) Abu! Abu! (We see the beast
suspended from a rope suspended from a tree.)
GUARD: Arrest him!
 
(The grenades are placed on his legs and arms. Another GUARD is tied up
ALFORMA is a steel frame around the wood.)
 
JAFAR: I'm afraid you're welcome, Prince
Abooboo is a skeleton . (He leaves.) He's doing well
was never found.
 
(A GUARD hits him in the head, knocking him unconscious. Cut to him

He remembers it now, but his feet are bound to the rock. Rock
it hits the bottom of the pond, and then the turban drops and the lantern turns
out. He sees it, and tries to move the lamp. However, it is
he fell unconscious on the floor. The lamp is not stable
with his walk, he rolls down and taps his shoulders. He trembles, .
and GENIE mixed with bathtub, rubber duckie and shower cap)
 
GENIE: It never fails. Go into the bathroom and get a scrub
lamp to lamp. (Duck chuckles) Hello. (See also the cover
fool ALADDIN) Al? Al! Child, get out of there!
You can’t cheat on this one! I can't help you
or make a wish. You say “Genie I”.
I want to save my life." Got it? Okay. C'mon
Aladdin is the one!! (He takes ALADDIN in his arms and.
he shakes it off. His head rises, then falls.) I
the answer is yes. (The head becomes a mermaid).
Wooga is it! Wooga is it! (For inner ship.) Above
worth! (He talks about things
In the German language. A torrent of water flows from above
from, down the rock. His name is ALADDIN
he wakes up again and coughs water out of his lungs.)
Don’t be so scared!
ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(I don't know how
that, so they hug.) Thank you, Genie.
GENIUS: Oh, Al. I'm kind of in love, baby. No
they say they want to pull the curtains or something.
 
(Cut to JASMINE in her room, dancing to "A Whole New World" and brushing her teeth
his hair is smooth. SULTAN comes out of the double doors,hypnotized.)
 
SULTAN: Jasmine: Baby!
JASMINE: Oh, sir--I just had a better time.
I am so happy to be here.
SULTAN: (Very monotone under hypnosis) You must be,
Jasmine was like that. I have chosen a man for you.
JASMINE: E dun?
SULTAN: (Another door opens to reveal JAFAR.) You do
She married Jafar.
 
(JASMINE smiles at him).
 
JAFAR: You're speechless, I see. Quality is a
government.
JASMINE: I'll never marry you. (Goes to SULTAN)
Dad, I chose Prince Ali!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is out!
 
(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing at the edge of the balcony).
 
ALADDIN: Please read your crystal again, Jafar!
JASMINE: Prince Ali ye!
 
(JAFAR smiles at ALADDIN).
 
IAGO: How about--(again in parrot-ese)--uh, awk!
ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar! You tried to be with me
killed by the sword.
JAFAR: What is that? (Going to the SULTAN) LIGHTNING
bad words, your majesty. He is obviously lying.
(Approaches the SULTAN's face and delivers the cane).
SULTAN: Obviously...a lie.
 
(ALADDIN sees the workers with sparkling eyes).
 
JASMINE: Dad, what's wrong with you?
ALADDIN: ¡Nayajj yattwa!
 
(ALADDIN grabs the stick and smashes it to the ground. JAFAR faints
and the spell is destroyed forever.)
 
SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh!
ALADDIN: Your pride, Jafar used you
this! (Puts employees first)
SULTAN: What is that? Is that Jafar? You, you traitor!
 
(The three men lead the way in JAFAR.)
 
JAFAR: Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
SULTAN: ¡Guardanaka! ¡Guardanaka!
IAGO: Well, it's--we're dead, and forget it. Enough
dig a grave for both of us. We're dying to die.
 
(But JAFAR sees the flashlight in ALADDIN’s pocket. He turns, but.
which is held by the guards.)
 
SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.
JAFAR: This hasn't happened yet, boy!
 
(JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket. ALADDIN sees it and hurries away
he, but JAFAR threw the whistle to the ground. A thick red cloud
appears on the screen. If he disappears, so does JAFAR.)
 
SULTAN: Search, search everywhere!
ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you all right?
JASMINE: He's a snake.
 
(They snuggle up for a kiss, but the SULTAN barges in between them).
 
SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted advisor, decides not to

(He stops mid-sentence and looks at them both).
Is it true? My daughter finally a

He has, he has. And you will be happier and more successful, as well.
then my son, you will be a sultan!
ALADDIN: The Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, young man standing as good as you, a
a man whose morality can be deposed
Exactly what this kingdom needs! (ALADDIN looks at him
and anxiety.)
 
(Cut to int. JAFAR's cameras. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)
 
IAGO: We have to get out of here! We should know that-- I should know that
start packing, your pride. Only the most important things.
(IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage.
JAFAR smiles brightly.) Travel light! Bring it to me, please
gun, gun, knife (He goes and takes
a and a portrait of JAFAR ) and how
in this picture? I don't know--I think I'm making one
there is a strange face. (JAFAR starts laughing hard).
Oh, boy--it went nuts. He separated it. (IAGO) (IAGO) (IAGO)
ran up to him and hit him on the head.) Jafar?
Is that Jafar? grab one, Jafar! (JAFAR holds him around
back) Good catch!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing but that fluffy bear
Aladdin is a brother. Get the lantern, Iago.
IAGO: Why is it unfortunate--
JAFAR: But you have to calm him down!
IAGO: Is it me?
 
(Cut to outside the palace. ALADDIN looks out over the gardens.)
 
ALADDIN: The Sultan? Do they want me to be the sultan?
 
(GENIE comes out of the lamp)
 
GENIUS: Huzzah! Congratulations to the conquering hero! (Now a
a one-man band. He sees ALADDIN walking with him
head hanging down. He stops, shakes his head, and comes
with the idea, expanding it to ALADDIN . He's holding it
arms raised like a director on a photo booth
we look between them.) Aladi, you have won now
her heart belongs to the princess. Whatever you do
next? (ALADDIN enters and looks at him
to the mourning bed, on which he fell and wept.
GENIE regains consciousness and throws herself at him
an inscription entitled "Aladdin". Ask: ) .
Psst, the line is "I want to save my sanity".
There is a time.
ALADDIN: Genie...Ne did.
GENIE: Of course you do. You just go "Genie, I need you."
free." (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses it
a mock ventriloquist dummy. ALADDIN is far away.)
ALADDIN: I'm still thinking. Look, I'm sorry--I'm really sorry. But
they want to make me a sultan--no!, They want to make me
Prince Ali is the sultan. Without you, I am just Aladdin.
GENIE: Al, you win!
ALADDIN: For you! The only reason is who I am
there is something for you. What if they find out?
Am I not really a king? (Silence) How is it possible
Does Jasmine know that? I will lose it. Genie, I think, ot
I have kept this up myself. I don't want to save you.
GENIE: (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand. Barry,
you lied to everyone. Hey, I was getting started
to feel abandoned. Now, if you'll excuse me, .
teacher. (So ​​the last word sounds angry
poofs back to the lamp.)
 
(ABU and CARPET look out the window).
 
ABU: Ohhh and so on.
ALADDIN: Genie, I'm really sorry. (An open mouth.
spouts and raspberries to it.) Okay, okay. (She snorts
on a LAMP bar.) Then stay in place
there! (Looks at ABU and ALFORNA.) See what
young people are watching ? (They both leave.) Look, I--I
I'm sorry. Wait, Abu-- wait--I'm sorry, I can't--
there's, c'mon. (Sighs.) What am I doing?
Genie is right--I have to be right with Jasmine.
JASMINE: (From the wrong side) Ali, oh Ali--are you coming here?
ALADDIN: (Putting on his hat) Well, this goes. (He wanders around
into the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?
 
(We see IAGO with his back in and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO
in the pond. She is mimicking JASMINE's voice.)
 
IAGO: Ahem--in the Menagerie, right away.
ALADDIN: I'm coming.
 
(We see ALADDIN running by, not the birds. IAGO laughs,
turning back towards the face of a FLAMINGO, it is
with a smile.)
 
FLAMINGO: Nothing!
IAGO: Ya a problem, pinky? (He should clean the bird
the legs are removed. IAGO runs into the palace
having a lamp under the pillow.) The boy, Jafar
glad to see you! (He rubs his forehead
he looks JAFAR and reads.) Good job, Iago!
(Normal) Ah, go ahead. (JAFAR) No, really--on the investigation
out of ten, you are eleven! (Normal) Ah, that's it.
Jafar--you're too kind. I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed
yellow scales. (He turns on the lamp).
 
(Cut to the palace gate. The SULTAN is standing up, doing it
a message to the people.)
 
SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally a.
suitor accepts!
 
(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is watching. ALADDIN
appears at the bottom of the canopy.)
 
ALADDIN: Jasmine: Bamako?
JASMINE: Ali, i taara min?
ALADDIN: Something I should tell you.
JASMINE: The whole kingdom belongs to her father
turn on the phone!
ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!
JASMINE: Good luck! (He throws her on the platform
with SULTAN , where he is all over it
more.)
SULTAN: ... Ali Ababwa !
ALADDIN: ¡Ay, muso!
 
(Above, IAGO and JAFAR look out of a window).
 
IAGO: Look at them, and smile at that little pipsqueak.
JAFAR: Let them be happy.
 
(He picks up the lantern and shakes it. The GENIE appears).
 
GENIE: You know Al, I see (turns to see JAFAR)
really nayyyy--i don't know. (THE
goes downstairs to ask for the playbook.) Tonight the
position Al is heavy, dark and.
sinister evil person.
JAFAR: I am your master now. (He pulled the GENIE
on the ground and putting his foot in GENIE's face.)
GENIE: O de tun b ne siran.
JAFAR: Genie, give me my first wish. I want to make a judgment on that
high, like a sultan!!!
 
(Cut to ext where dark clouds surround the castle. The castle shakes.
The roof cracks and SULTAN and ALADDIN make eggs.)
 
ALADDIN: Well done!
SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What is going on?
 
(His mane is off his head. If he touches it, it's his whole body
runs away , taking off all clothes except his boxers
shortcuts are available. This dress has been republished in JAFAR.)
 
JAFAR: Nothing!
SULTAN: Jafar, you terrible traitor.
IAGO: Sultan Vile traitor.
ALADDIN: Oh, what? Well, we'll see about that! (Pulls and more
picks up the same turban, but finds it empty) Lamp!
JAFAR: Interrogator- viewers, Abooboo.
 
(They both looked up and saw a huge GENIUS hovering above the palace
clouds.. ALADDIN winds up as ALFORMA runs to greet him.
They fly right next to GENIE's head.)
 
ALADDIN: All right! No!
GENIE: Sorry, kid--I just got a new teacher. (Saw...
a hilltop palace.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I command you to stop!
JAFAR: Now there's a new order--my order! Finally, you
he will bow down before me!
 
(SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not).
 
JAFAR: We will never bow down to you!
IAGO: Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR: If you weren't bowing to the sultan, you were
fear in the presence of the whore! (to GENIE) Genie, I say
my second intention--I want to be strong
The wizard of the world!
 
(GENIE raises his hand. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but fails,
and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning JAFAR,
restoring it to its original state.)
 
IAGO: Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you for a good Agrabah
Lagbɛri Jafar!
JAFAR: Where are you now? Ah, yes--bad treasure!
(He zaps JASMINE and SULTAN with his wand, and.
they both bow before him. RAJAH runs towards her.
A zap RAJAH, ani jara ye kiti-
cat.) Upstairs, boy! Oh, princess--(lifting her chin
with his staff)--there's someone I want to die with
to guide you.
ALADDIN: (off camera) Jafar! Get your hands off it!
 
(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN. ALFORMA runs away.)
 
JAFAR: Prince Ali ye
Yes, it is,
But not as you know.
Read my lips and hold me
Laki
 
(JAFAR approaches them both in the air).
 
Yes, face a bulge from your past
Whose lie was so good, they didn’t last forever
Thank you Prince Ali!
 
(JAFAR turns ALI back to ALADDIN.)
 
IAGO: Or should I say Aladdin?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
 
JAFAR: So Ali just became Aladdin
That's just a con, should I move on?
Take it away from me
His character is wrong
Give me something good
To send you a package on a road trip
So their hopes are in danger
His things were frozen, their meeting place chosen
Is it the ends of the earth, whoopee!
Flow, .
IAGO: Hello, be careful!
JAFAR: Old Prince Ali!
 
(JAFAR restores ABU. He sends them both away
a tall pillar, and threw it like a missile, but it did not take off yet
ALFORMA reaches into F2B, and we see an empty void, somewhere
the pillar collapses. Finally, it comes to standing still.
ALADDIN appears, obviously cool.)
 
ALADDIN: Is it Abu? Abu! (It has a vibrating pile.

ABU comes out and shoves him under his jacket.) Abu!
Are you okay with that? I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess
everything, in a way. I have to go back and live
things are getting better. (He starts walking through the snow,
and finally steps on a heated RUGS.)

the existing pillar. He beats himself up to try and save ALFORMATA. THE
he can't do that , so he starts whimpering

IAGO: Does the gunman want a cookie? This is your cracker.
Grind them up to the neck. Here it is, it is
more!
 
(JAFAR removes the chain, JASMINE approaches with an apple).
 
JAFAR: A' ye a to yen!
 
(IAGO pauses for a second, then continues).
 
JAFAR: It’s heartbreaking to see you this embarrassed, Jasmine.
(He takes a bite out of the apple he is holding).
Beautiful wildflower as you should be
in the hands of the world’s most powerful man.
(She raises her hand and a branch appears.) What can you do
i mean, dear sister? Why, you and my queen…
 
(Takes a glass of wine and throws it in his face).
 
JASMINE: Of course!
JAFAR: Let me teach you some honor! (She falls back like him
he raises his hand and strikes her. Then he gets up.) No.
Genie, I've decided to make the final decision. I
They want Princess Jasmine to fall easily
love with me.
 
(We see ALADDIN running back into town).
 
GENIE: (Again as Buckley) Ah, Professor-- there are some
you start on, koa mun for what- .
JAFAR: Don't come back to me, you stupid blue lout! YOU
will do what I say, slave !
 
(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, gesticulating
then play the game.)
 
JASMINE: (Rising to the crown).
Jafar is a country! I never realized how incredible he was
you are so beautiful.
 
(GENIE is beaten.)
 
JAFAR: That’s better. (Takes GENIE's throat with a.
shadow.) Now, pussycat, tell me more
and...myself.
JASMINE: You're tall, well-dressed...
 
(JAFAR approaches him. ALADDIN flies with ABU and GENIE
are seen by them.)
 
GENIE: ¡Al! Al, jisk'a masi!
ALADDIN: ¡Shh!
GENIE: (Actually closes her mouth, then zips it up).
Al, I can't help it--I work for a psychopath senor,
now. (He heads for JAFAR, then turns away).
ALADDIN: Hey--I'm a street dog, remember? (See GENIE's rezip
da.) I improvise.
 
(She lands a pile of money and hides near JAFAR and JASMINE.
JAFAR's back in ALADDIN.)
 
JAFAR: Go ahead.
JASMINE: And your hair is...so...heavy! (He shows it to her
wrapping his arms around her. He pretends to run with it
thumbs up, but it really symbolizes ALADDIN
and come to that. He's doing his walking. IAGO sees it.)
 
IAGO: Gag--mmmmmm it works! (ABU grabs her and shuts her mouth).
JAFAR: And the street dog?
JASMINE: Some street dogs?
 
(They are kissing as IAGO reaches for a plate. JAFAR
he turns to look, but JASMINE catches him and kisses him. His name is ALADDIN
the appearance of it is disgusting. Both IAGO and ABU are known for their cruelty.)
 
ABU: ¡Yukja ye!
JAFAR: That's--(it's ALADDIN's idea of ​​it
crown.) Yeah!! How often do I have it
to kill, boy?
 
(He zaps ALADDIN. JASMINE immediately pulls it, a.
down. ALADDIN quickly grabs the wand.)
 
ALADDIN: Take the lantern!
 
(JASMINE runs to her. But JAFAR chokes ALADDIN, like this
zaps an lɛrɛw.)
 
JAFAR: Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!
 
(Sand starts falling on him from above).
 
ALADDIN: Jasmine is a job!
IAGO: Oh, good shot, Jaf-- (shot by ABU.)
 
(ABU runs for the lamp).
 
JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He zaps a toy monkey.
ALADDIN: ¡Abu!
 
 
(ALFORMA enters soon.)
 
JAFAR: Things are heating up fast, now boy. (in the ALFORMA box

great swords are tied in the field. JAFAR caught it

the sword came out of the ground.) I'm just warming up
above! (She blows a fireball at ALADDIN's side.)
ALADDIN: You're afraid to fight me, you coward
Qatar safe na?
JAFAR: Snake, right? You might want to try it out
as snake I would be! (Very funny, too.
you see a snake sticking out of the back of its mouth
teeth. Then he turns into a giant cobra, and.
the ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes partial
the snake tied him to ALADDIN. Snake JAFAR does it
He goes to ALADDIN, and on the third attempt, he goes to ALADDIN
the sword struck JAFAR and struck. See GENIE
actors wearing 'A' suits.)
 
GENIE: Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--you're lying on the sword
snake is !
JAFAR: Stay with the herresses!
 
(GENIE pointing to a 'J' on a small banner.)
 
GENIE: (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't make it,
CLOSE!
 
(ALADDIN's distraction rests in the hourglass area.
JASMINE is freaking out. However, JAFAR saw this and blocked the way.
ALADDIN gets hit, loses his sword.)
 
JASMINE: Aladdin!
 
(ALADDIN jumps on a boulder and rolls to the ground, getting caught
with a sword on its way. He turns a corner, but a trailing snake
it is impossible , and the first half of JAFAR falls through a wall and.
hanging outside the palace. ALADDIN jumped on the snake's back
killing him with a knife. JAFAR screamed in anger. ALADDIN tries again
saving the princess.)
 
ALADDIN: ¡Jasmine, warkt'asim!
 
(He almost hits the glass with his sword, JAFAR catches him).
 
JAFAR: (laughs evil) You little fool! You're right
you can defeat the strongest man on earth!
IAGO: (with GENIE coming from behind) Fuck him,
Jafar--Fuck ai like a--awk! (GENIE scratches his back
out of the way) .
JAFAR: Without a genie, boy, you have nothing!
ALADDIN: (A thought) Genie! That wisdom! His genius.
stronger than it will ever be!
JAFAR: We!!
ALADDIN: He gave me your power, and he can take it!
GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why did you come with me
in this way ?
ALADDIN: Look, Jafar--you're still second!
JAFAR: You are right! His power is stronger than mine! But
it doesn't last long!
 
(JAFAR turns around GENIE.)
 
GENIE: That boy is crazy. Drink a little punch. A
many clashing with the snake (In His hand
turns into a snake and hits him on the head with it.)
JAFAR: Who, I make my third wish! I want to be everybody
mighty genie!
GENIE: (Reluctantly) Well, your will is my command.
For the road, Al.
 
(GENIE zap JAFAR with GENIE (tm) trading end lightning.
JAFAR’s dying form disappears and he becomes intelligent. And
watch JASMINE lose her finger in the sand. His name is ALADDIN
fell and ended up shattering the glass. The beauty and the princess
you must pour it out.)
 
JAFAR: Yes! Than! That’s the power! Absolute power!
JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
ALADDIN: Trust me!
 
(A blue lantern appears from JAFAR's base. JAFAR is being deceived.)
 
JAFAR: The earth is mine to command, to rule!
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Jafar! Are you forgetting something?
(JAFAR looks at him curiously) You want to be smart, e
I understand! And everything that goes with it!
 
(JAFAR’s fingers are tied with bindings).
 
JAFAR: Yes! Yes!
IAGO: I want to be here! Come on, you’re the one
genie, I don't care--
 
(IAGO tries to escape, but JAFAR knocks him down.)
 
ALADDIN: Phenomenal cosmic power! Itty bitty living space.
GENIUS: Al, you little genie, you!
 
(ABU returns to normal, ALFORMA ravels again, JASMINE, SULTAN
and RAJAH they stand together. RAJAH jumps into his arms
SULTAN, and all changed. The SULTAN sighs
There is the weight of the new RAJAH. The palace reappeared
where he used to be. ALADDIN is.
with a new lamp.)
 
JAFAR: (They both come out of the lamp.) Take out the swollen stomach
Where are the timers?
IAGO: Oh, i da tugu, i moron!
JAFAR: I'm not telling you to shut up!
GENIE: Let me answer. (He picks up the flashlight and.
on the porch. He now wears a baseball cap. THE
the wind blows like a thrown lamp , but it opens its own
palm flat and climb into the forest
with his hand.) In a cave of ten thousand years
miracles should give him chills!
 
(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue in defeat. JASMINE walks away
to the ALADDIN. They hold hands, but both look sad).
 
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I lied to you a
Prince.
JASMINE: I know why.
ALADDIN: Well, I guess...this... is it true? (said GENIE
his head rounded the corner and he marveled at her state
ist'aña.)
JASMINE: Oh, that stupid rule. This isn't fair--I love you.
GENIE: (Chuckles) Al, that's okay. You are still there.
there was desire. Just say the word and you have a
the king mayampi.
ALADDIN: But Genie, what about your freedom?
GENIE: Hey, just work forever. This is
love. (She sits down next to him.) Al, you see that
he won't find another girl like him in a million
years. Believe me, I know. I've looked at it.
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I love you, but I have to stop
making it seem like something I don't have.
JASMINE: I understand.
 
(They make one last look at each other, and ALADDIN turns away
for GENIE.)
 
ALADDIN: Genie, I wish you salvation.
GENIE: A bona fide prince of pedigree in me. I'm--what?
ALADDIN: (Holding the lantern to the GENIUS.) Genie, you are
knocking it out of there!
 
(A cycle of change follows, in which the revolutions fall
The GENIUS doll and lantern fell to the ground to no avail.
GENIE took it and looked down.)
 
GENIE: (Incredulous.) Heh, heh! I am free to go. Am
free. (He hands the lantern to ALADDIN.) Quickly,
immediately, whatever one desires. Say, "I want to.
Nil." Love Nil. Try it!
ALADDIN: I want the Nile.
GENIE: Not so!! (He laughs hysterically. He turns around
the broom looks like a big pin.) Oh you got that
Very! I am free! I am finally free! I'm going to hit it.
thaki. I want to see the world! I--
 
(He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN staring at him
that is very sad.)
 
ALADDIN: Genie, ne b'a--n b'i miss.
GENIE: I mean, Al. No matter what anyone says, i.
to be a boss to me.
 
(They kiss. The SULTAN steps forward.)
 
SULTAN: That's right. You've certainly proved your worth
as I have said. That’s the rule of thumb
jan walt'a.
JASMINE: The father?
SULTAN: Well, am I a sultan or am I a sultan? Since then
first the princess can marry whomever she wants
relevant.
JASMINE: (With a smile on her face, she runs into ALADDIN's arms).
HE! I choose...I choose you, Aladdin.
ALADDIN: Yes, hon. Call me Al.
 
(They were about to kiss, long green arms joining them all.
GENIE wears a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs on it and Goofy on it
sombrero.)
 
GENIE: Oh, ya all. Come here to the right place. Great group hugs!
Mind you I am kissing the monkey? (Kissing ABU.) Ooh, .
it’s so heartbreaking! So, I can’t do any more confusion around
stop this popcorn . I'm getting out of here! Bye, bye, goodbye.
you two lover in the dark. Hey, Rugman: shit! Am
history! No, I am a mythologist! No, I didn't do anything
for I--I am free!
 
(GENIE flies off into the blue sky, leaving a light behind
in the background. They cut it (jump to make it worse) .
until fireworks went off one night. We sat down and watched
ALADDIN and JASMINE run through ALFORMA.)
 
ALADDIN: A new era
JASMINE: A new life
PANI: (chorus off-camera) Ne ni e ye!
MAN COURT: New era!
 
(They fly into the moonlight, when they are lost,
The moon rises to reveal the smiling face of GENIE . Suddenly
the film is " pulled out," GENIE exalts it
and looks at the audience.)
 
GENIE: Look at ya!
 
(Returns film to normal, with normal moon. Fade to black.
to laban.)
