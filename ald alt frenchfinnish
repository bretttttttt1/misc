1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,720
#Oh, I'm from the country
from a far away place#

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,080
#Where the camels of the caravan roam#

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,640
#Where it's smooth and huge
And the heat is intense#

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,120
#It's barbaric, but hey, it's home#

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,680
#When the wind comes from the east
And the sun comes from the west

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,840
#And sand in the glass is right#

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,880
#Come down, come see us
Jump on the mat and fly#

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,280
#Towards another Arabian Night#

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,880
#Arabian Nights#

ten
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,520
#Like the Arab days#

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,160
#Most of the time
are hotter than hot#

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,680
#Lots of good manners#

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,080
#Arabian Nights#

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,600
#'Neath Arab Moons#

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,600
#Unprepared fool
Can fall and fall hard#

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,160
#Over there, on the dune#

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,320
Ah, Salaam and good evening
to you, dear friend.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
Please come closer.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,080
Too close. A little too close.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
there.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,040
Welcome to Agrabah,

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,480
mysterious city,

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,160
of enchantment,

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,960
and the best stuff this side
Jordan, on sale today.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Look at this. Yeah.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Hookah and coffee maker combination.
Also makes julienne potatoes.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,960
No offense. No...

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
It fell apart.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,080
Oops! Look at this.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,800
I have never seen
one of them was previously intact.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
This is famous
Tupperware from the Dead Sea.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,440
Listen. Ah, still good.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
Wait. Do not go.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,560
I see you're just interested
in exceptionally rare cases.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,640
I think you would then
will be most rewarded for considering this.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Don't be fooled
because of the banal appearance.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,800
Like so many things,
it's not what's outside

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,960
but what is important inside.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
This is no ordinary lamp.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,560
Once it changed course
of a young man's life.

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,640
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than it seemed.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,040
A diamond in the rough.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,280
Maybe you would
do you want to hear a story?

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,960
It begins in the dark of night...

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,120
where the dark man waits

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,400
with a dark lens.

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,280
You are late.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,160
A thousand apologies, oh patient one.

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
Do you have it then?

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,840
I had to cut a few throats,
but i got it.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,880
Ah-ah-ahhh.

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
Treasure.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,600
Ouch!

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,440
Trust me my spicy friend.

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,560
- You get what you expect.
- What's wrong. Ouch!

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,480
Quickly! Follow the path.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,640
Faster.

58
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,600
In the end anyway
my years of research...

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,280
Cave of Wonders.

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,520
Alright. Cave of Wonders.

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,080
By Allah.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,080
Remember now.
Bring me the lamp.

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,880
The rest of the treasure
is yours, but the lamp is mine.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,280
Oh, the lamp. Oh, the lamp.

65
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Damn where were you looking
is this Bozo standing?

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,120
Shh

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,160
Who disturbs sleep?

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,640
It's me, Gazeem,

69
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,640
a humble thief.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,360
Know this.

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,920
Only one can come here,

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,560
whose value is far.

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,560
A diamond in the rough.

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,680
What are you waiting for #Continue.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
No!

76
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,960
Looking for you
rakatimantti

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,520
I can not believe it.
I just don't believe it.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,640
We never will
take that stupid lamp.

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,200
Forget it.
Look at this.

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm so angry that I tolerate it.

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,400
Patience, Lake. Patience.

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,080
Gazeem apparently wasn't worth it.

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,080
Oh, there's a big surprise.

84
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,600
I think I'm having a heart attack
and die of this surprise.

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,160
What are we going to do?
We have a big problem here, a big...

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Joo.

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,240
Only one can enter.

88
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
I need to find this, this...

89
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
rakatimantti

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,400
Stop! Thief!

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Stop! Thief!

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,600
I have your hand
trophy, street rat.

93
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,280
All this for bread?

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,920
Wow!

95
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,760
- Here it is!
- You won't get through this so easily!

96
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,800
Did you think it was easy?

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,800
You two over there
and you, follow me.

98
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,120
- We'll find him.
- Hey ladies.

99
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,880
We run into problems a little early
today, right, Aladdin?

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
Worry. Not at all. You just are
in trouble if caught.

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,680
- I got you.
- I have problems.

102
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,120
And this time...

103
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,840
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,440
- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,080
#I gotta keep jumping
Ahead of the bread line#

106
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,160
#A step before the sword#

107
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,720
#I only steal what I can't afford#

108
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,880
That's all.

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,600
#a step ahead of lawyers#

110
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
#That's it and it's no joke#

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,640
#These guys don't like that I'm broke#

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,880
- Precipitation.
- Street rat.

113
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,840
- Scammer.
- Ota se.

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,720
#Just a little snack guys#

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,480
#Rip it up
take it back guys#

116
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,440
#I get the hint
I have to face the facts#

117
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,560
- #You are my only friend, Abu#
- WHO?

118
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,080
#Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom#

119
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,680
#He became single to increase crime#

120
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,560
#I would blame the parents
Except he doesn't have them#

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,320
#I must eat to live
i have to steal to eat#

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,760
#I will tell you everything
When I had time#

123
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,400
#Jump ahead of slow kicks
One step ahead of my loss#

124
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,720
#Next time I'll use a pen name#

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,760
Here it is.

126
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,640
#Leap ahead of the killers
A step ahead of the pack#

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,320
#I think I'll go for a walk
Around the block#

128
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,240
- Stop, thief.
- Vandal.

129
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,840
- Abu!
- A scandal.

130
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,960
#Let's not be in too much of a hurry#

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,840
#But I think it's pretty tasty#

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
#I must eat to live
i have to steal to eat#

133
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
#otherwise we would get along fine#

134
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,520
Fake.

135
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
Grab it!

136
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
He has a sword!

137
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,600
You are idiots.
We all have swords.

138
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,760
- #jump before hitting the hooves#
- Vandal!

139
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,600
- #jump before the crash#
- Damn you rat!

140
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,520
- #One thing before disaster#
- Cheater!

141
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
#They're fast, but I'm much faster#

142
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,840
#Please I better put my hand in#

143
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,200
# Wish me a safe landing
All I have to do is jump#

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,960
Good luck! Hey!

145
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
And now, dear effendi, we enjoy.

146
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,200
Clear.

147
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,600
Us us!

148
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,400
Oh no.

149
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,760
Here. Jack. Take it.

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,040
Oh no. Huh?

151
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
On the way to the palace, I guess.

152
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Another suitor for the princess.

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,560
- Get out of my way, brats.

154
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,040
Hey!

155
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,680
If I were as rich as you
I could indulge in certain habits.

156
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,600
I see. I'm going to teach you manners.

157
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,840
Look at that, Abu.

158
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
You don't see that every day
a horse with two rear ends.

159
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
Ooh!

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,480
You are a worthless street rat.

161
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,720
You were born a street rat,
you die like a street rat

162
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
and only your fleas cry for you.

163
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,680
I'm not worth anything.

164
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,880
And I don't have fleas.

165
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,320
Come on, Abu.
Let's go home.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,120
#Riffraff, katurotta#

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,440
#i don't buy this#

168
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,120
#If only they would look closer#

169
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,200
#would they see the poor boy#

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,920
#No sir#

171
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,240
#They would find out#

172
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,920
#There's so much more#

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,000
#To me#

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,880
One day, Abu,
things change.

175
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,800
We become rich, we live in a palace,

176
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,000
and I've never had any problems.

177
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
I have never been so offended.

178
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,920
Oh Prince Ahmed.
You're not leaving that early, are you?

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,040
Good luck marrying him.

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,600
Oh yes! Jasmine.

181
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,800
Jasmine!

182
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,720
Jasmine!

183
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,720
- Jasmine!

184
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,840
That's fucked up, Rajah.

185
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Hence Prince Ahmed
hit

186
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,520
Oh dad.

187
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,320
Rajah was just playing with him.
Isn't that right, Rajah?

188
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,520
you're just kidding
also dressed in

189
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,240
Self-centered Prince Ahmed,
Is not it ?

190
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,360
Honey, you need to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes calling.

191
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,120
The law says
you must be married to a prince…

192
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,080
before your next birthday.

193
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
The law is wrong.

194
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,800
You only have three days left.

195
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,360
Dad, I hate being forced to do this.

196
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,600
If I get married,
I want it to be for love.

197
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,760
Jasmine...

198
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,880
it's not just this law.

199
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm not going to be here forever,
well i...

200
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,880
I just want to be sure
you will be taken care of.

201
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,280
Anticipated.

202
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,960
Try to understand.

203
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,080
I've never done anything myself.
I never had real friends.

204
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,800
Except you, Rajah.

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,200
I've never even been there
outside the palace walls.

206
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,640
But Jasmine, you are a princess.

207
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,520
So maybe I don't want to
to be more of a princess.

208
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
Oooh! me me...

209
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,360
Allah forbids you to do so
have daughters.

210
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
Hmm?

211
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,360
I don't know where he got it from.

212
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,280
His mother was not so picky.

213
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,760
I see! Ah, Jafar.

214
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,240
My most trusted advisor.

215
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
I desperately need your wisdom.

216
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
My life is only to serve you, my lord.

217
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,440
That's the suitors' business.

218
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,920
Jasmine refuses
choose a husband.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,880
- I'm at the end of my nerves.
- Oh okay ! End of the rope!

220
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,720
I see!

221
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,160
Have a cookie, pretty Polly.

222
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,400
Your Majesty absolutely
reasonable with stupid animals.

223
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,960
NOW,
maybe i can guess the solution

224
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,080
to this difficult problem.

225
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
If anyone can help, it's you.

226
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,680
But this would require some use
of the mystical blue diamond.

227
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,520
I see. Oh my ring?

228
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,880
But it's been in the family for years.

229
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
We have to find out
princess suitor.

230
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,840
Do not worry.

231
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,440
Everything will be fine.

232
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,960
Everything will be fine.

233
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Diamond.

234
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,520
Here, Jafar.

235
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,920
Everything you need is in order.

236
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,600
You are very kind, my lord.

237
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,160
Now run and play
with your little toys, huh?

238
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,640
Yeah. It's going to be pretty good.

239
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
I can not take it anymore !

240
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,600
If I have to choke one more time
those moldy, disgusting cookies...

241
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Boom! Hit!

242
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,200
Calm down, Lago.

243
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,480
Then I grabbed her head.
Hit!

244
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,240
Soon I will be a Sultan,
not this stupid idiot.

245
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,480
And then I fill with cookies
in his throat.

246
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,000
Haha!

247
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,240
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

248
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,320
But I can't stay here
and let my life live for me.

249
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,280
I will miss you.

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,080
Hey Hey.

251
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,040
Okay, Abu. Go.

252
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Try it. Your taste buds
dances and sings.

253
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,040
Get your paw off of it.

254
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Why you...

255
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Out of here,
you damned dirty monkey!

256
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,880
Hey Hey.

257
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,120
Well done Abu.

258
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Breakfast will be served.

259
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,880
Beautiful woman, buy a pot.

260
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,200
There is no finer pot made of brass or silver.

261
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Sugar dates.
Sweet dates and figs.

262
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,800
Sweet dates and pistachios.

263
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,600
Would a woman like a necklace?

264
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,120
A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.

265
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,520
Fresh fish!

266
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,000
We catch them, you buy them!

267
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,680
Oh no. I do not believe.

268
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
I see!

269
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,960
Sorry.

270
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm really, really sorry.

271
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,640
Wow.

272
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,560
Oh no.

273
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,600
Good morning. Good morning?

274
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,920
Oh, you must be hungry.

275
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
Here is.

276
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,680
You better be able to pay for it.

277
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,800
Pay?

278
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
No one steals my basket.

279
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,600
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I do not have money.

280
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,040
- The powers!
- Please...

281
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,000
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get from Sultan.

282
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,160
you know what
is there a penalty for theft?

283
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,880
No! No thanks!

284
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
Thank you sir.
I'm so glad you found it.

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
I'm looking for you everywhere.

286
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,920
- What are you doing?
- Play a game.

287
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,240
Do you know this girl?

288
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,800
Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister.

289
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
He's a little crazy.

290
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,160
He said he knew the Sultan.

291
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,960
He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

292
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,360
O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?

293
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Tragic, right?

294
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,600
But no harm is done.

295
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,400
Come now, sister.
It's time to go to the doctor.

296
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,840
Hello, Doctor.
How's it going?

297
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,400
- No no no. Not this one.
- Come, Sultan.

298
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,680
Eh. What?

299
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,040
Come back here, you little thieves!

300
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,680
With all due respect,
Your rottenness,

301
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,200
can't we just wait
for the right storm?

302
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,160
Save your breath, Lago. Faster.

303
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,800
Yes, oh mighty Evil.

304
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,160
Gone, the sands of time.

305
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Reveal it to me
who can enter the cave.

306
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,480
Yeah! Yeah!

307
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,840
Here it is.

308
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,200
My diamond in the rough.

309
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,680
It's him. It's a clown
Did we wait?

310
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,800
Let the guards get on with it
an invitation to the palace, okay?

311
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
Swell.

312
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,120
Almost there.

313
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,480
I want to thank you
for arresting this man.

314
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,120
Forget it.

315
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,360
So this is your first time
in the market, huh?

316
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
Is it that obvious?

317
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,160
Well, you stand out.

318
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,400
I mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

319
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,960
Hmmm, I'm a fast learner.

320
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,480
Wow.

321
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,680
Hey.

322
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,640
Come on. Like this.

323
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,640
Wow. Watch your head out there.

324
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
Be careful.

325
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,000
Do you live here?

326
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,160
Yeah. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

327
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,120
This looks amazing.

328
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,280
Well, it's not much,
but it has a great view.

329
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Wow. The palace looks
Pretty surprising, huh?

330
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, that's wonderful.

331
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,920
I wondered what it would be like
it's like i lived there

332
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,360
and they have servants and servants.

333
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,960
Oh, of course. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

334
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,400
It's better than here.

335
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,160
You are always looking for food
and dodge the guards.

336
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
You are not free to do
your own choices.

337
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,920
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

338
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,160
...ansa.

339
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,240
So where are you from?

340
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,840
What does it matter?

341
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,400
I ran away
and I'm not going back.

342
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,960
Really. How so?

343
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,640
Why you...

344
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,800
My father forces me
get married.

345
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,560
It's... it's terrible.

346
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,920
Abu!

347
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,120
What?

348
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,680
Abu says…
it's not fair.

349
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
What?

350
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,200
- Is that right?
- Of course.

351
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,880
Ja Abu
do you have anything else to say?

352
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,320
Well, he wishes he had
something he could do to help.

353
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Oh no.

354
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,040
Hmm.

355
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,480
Tell him it's very nice.

356
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,040
There you are.

357
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,400
- They're after me! You?
- My father must have sent them...

358
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,680
- Do you trust me?
- What?

359
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,640
- Do you trust me?
- Joo...

360
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
So jump!

361
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,760
We keep crossing paths,
Aren't you, street rat?

362
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,520
Run! Go! Out of here!

363
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,960
Take this thing away from me!

364
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,800
- This is a dungeon for you, son.
- Let me go.

365
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,120
Let him go.

366
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,520
- Look here, men. Street mouse.

367
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,040
Let it be,
on the princess's orders.

368
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,040
Princess Jasmine.

369
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,800
- Princess?
- Princess?

370
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,800
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

371
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,520
It's not your problem.
Do as I say. Release him.

372
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,640
i will princess
except my orders come from Jafar.

373
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,480
- You need to discuss it with him.
- Believe me, I will.

374
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,280
Jafar?

375
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,080
Oh princess.

376
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,480
Ouch! Jafar, I'm stuck.

377
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,680
How can I be of help to you?

378
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,960
The guards just took the boy
of your order.

379
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,120
Your father blamed me
in maintaining peace in Agrabah.

380
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

381
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,960
I can't breathe, Jafar.

382
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,480
Why by kidnapping the princess,
Of course.

383
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,800
If only you could...
Ah! It hurts!

384
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,440
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.

385
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,320
Ohhh.

386
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,520
Oh, how shocking.
If I would have known...

387
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,760
What do you mean?

388
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,280
Alas, the verdict of the boy
has already been completed.

389
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,760
What sentence?

390
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
Death.

391
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,680
- By beating.
- No.

392
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,560
I'm very sorry, princess.

393
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,200
How are you?

394
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
So how did it go?

395
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,280
I think he took it pretty well.

396
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,160
It's all my fault, Rajah.

397
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
- I didn't even know his name.

398
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,720
She was a princess.

399
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,040
I can not believe it.

400
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,360
I must have looked
so stupid for him.

401
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,720
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!

402
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,080
Good morning!

403
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,760
Abu. Here.

404
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,920
Come on, help me out of this.

405
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,200
Hey, he was in trouble.
Ah, he was worth it.

406
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,080
Yeah yeah yeah

407
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Do not worry.
I will never see him again.

408
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there is a law.

409
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
She must marry the prince.

410
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,840
- He deserves a prince.
- Da-da!

411
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,880
I'm stupid.

412
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,760
You're just a fool
if you give up son

413
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,040
Who are you?

414
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,400
A humble prisoner like you.

415
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,280
But together,
maybe we can be more.

416
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm listening.

417
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,400
There is a cave, my son,
cave of wonders,

418
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
full of treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

419
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,200
Ooh!

420
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,080
A treasure that is even enough to impress
your princess i bet.

421
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,640
Jafar, can you hurry?
I'm dying for this.

422
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,200
But the law says that only a prince can...

423
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,000
You've heard of the golden rule,
Is not it ?

424
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,400
He who has gold
makes the rules.

425
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,040
Why are you sharing all this
lovely treasure with me?

426
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,480
I need a young pair of legs and
strong back to chase him.

427
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,160
One problem.

428
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,200
It is there.
We are here.

429
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,840
Um. Things are not always
what they look like.

430
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,600
SO...

431
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
do we have a contract

432
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
Oh, I don't know.

433
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,200
Who disturbs sleep?

434
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
It's me, Aladdin.

435
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,880
Proceed.

436
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,840
Do not touch anything other than the lamp.

437
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,000
remember my son
first bring me the lamp

438
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,880
and then you have to
get your reward.

439
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,640
Come on, Abu.

440
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,640
Can you watch this!

441
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,560
Just a handful of these things
would make me richer than the Sultan.

442
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
Abu!

443
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,200
Don't... touch... anything.

444
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,880
We need to find this lamp.

445
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,280
Eh?

446
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,080
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you stop him?

447
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,680
Abu what are you crazy?

448
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,800
A magic carpet.

449
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,160
Come on. Go out.
We're not going to hurt you.

450
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,440
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not going to bite.

451
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
THANK YOU.

452
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,520
Wait a moment. Do not go.

453
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,440
Maybe you can help us.

454
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,080
Hey! Wow!

455
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,640
You see, we try
to find this lamp.

456
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,880
I think he knows where it is.

457
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,600
Wait here.

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
I see!

459
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,520
That's it?

460
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,840
This is what we came for
all the way here...

461
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,760
Abu! They!

462
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,200
- Infidels!
- Oh no.

463
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,120
You touched
forbidden treasure!

464
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,320
Now you'll never do it again
see the day!

465
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,080
Wow!

466
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,680
Car! Car! Car!

467
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,160
I got you!

468
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,640
Mat, let's move.

469
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,640
Abu!

470
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,680
Abu, now is not the time to panic.

471
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,680
Start panicking.

472
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Wow!

473
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,720
- Help me.
- Throw me a lamp.

474
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,240
I can not take it.
Give me your hand.

475
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,040
Give me the lamp first.

476
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,800
Joo!

477
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,200
finally!

478
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,560
What are you doing?

479
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,040
Give you your reward.

480
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,840
Your eternal reward.

481
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,200
It's mine.

482
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,600
It's all mine.

483
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,320
I... where is he?

484
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,560
No.

485
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,640
No!

486
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,280
Jasmine?

487
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,440
Oh my darling.

488
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,120
What's wrong?

489
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,560
Jafar has...

490
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,920
did something terrible.

491
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,680
There, there, my love.

492
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,040
We'll make things right.

493
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,480
Now tell me everything.

494
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,880
I see.

495
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
Aladdin. Wake up.

496
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,080
Aladdin.

four hundred ninety seven
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,840
I see! My head.

498
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,080
They were trapped.

499
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,080
This two-faced jackal boy!

500
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,760
whoever he is
he has been away for a long time with that lamp.

501
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,960
Ah!

502
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,680
Well, you hairy little thief.

503
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,240
It looks like a beating,
worthless garbage.

504
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,680
Hi, I think so
something written here

505
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,920
but it's hard to understand.

506
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,600
Aaaaahhhhh!

507
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,760
Hey!

508
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,320
10,000 years will give you
such a stiff neck.

509
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,760
Wait a minute.

510
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,720
Wow! Wow!

511
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,680
Does it feel good?
be out of there.

512
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Nice to be back,
Ladies and gentlemen.

513
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,960
Hey. Where do you come from?
What is your name?

514
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,440
Er... Er, Aladdin.

515
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,320
Aladdin. Hello Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

516
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Can we call you "Ali"?
Or maybe just "Din".

517
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,000
Ja "Laddie"?
They'd say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."

518
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,600
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

519
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,480
Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do?

520
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,040
Sorry Cheetah.
I hope I didn't burn the fur.

521
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,760
Oh, Rugman. I did not see you
in a few millennia.

522
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,280
Give me the pompom.
Yoo. Eh eh.

523
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,720
Say you are much smaller
as my last master.

524
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,160
Or maybe I'll get bigger.
Look aside. Do I look different?

525
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,200
Wait a moment.
Am I your master?

526
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,120
Properly. He may be educated.
What would you wish for me?

527
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,400
Always impressive,

528
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,200
long content,

529
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,560
often imitated,

530
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,520
but never copied...

531
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Copied, duplicated...

532
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,160
Nero...

533
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
light up!

534
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,280
Here, straight from the lamp,

535
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,640
here for you
a lot of wish fulfillment.

536
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,040
THANK YOU.

537
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,720
Wow. Wish fulfillment?

538
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,160
Three wishes to be careful.

539
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,880
And ix-no to wish
for more wishes.

540
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,720
That's it. Three.
One two three.

541
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,000
No exchanges,
exchanges or returns.

542
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,200
Now I know I'm dreaming.

543
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,200
Master, I don't think you really understand
what do you have here

544
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,440
So why not just ruminate

545
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,360
when I shine
potential.

546
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,760
#Well, Ali Baba had 40 thefts#

547
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,560
#Scheherazade had a thousand stories#

548
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,440
#But sir you are lucky
Since you rolled up your sleeves#

549
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,800
#You have magic that never fails#

550
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,160
#You have power in your corner now#

551
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,440
#heavy ammo in your camp#

552
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,880
#You have punch and punch
Yahoo and how#

553
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,480
#Look, all you need to do
Rub this lamp and I say#

554
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,800
#Mr. Aladdin, sir
what is your joy#

555
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,240
#Let me take your order
rate it#

556
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,120
#You never had a friend like me#

557
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,240
#Life is your restaurant
And I'm your butler

558
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,960
#Come whisper what you want#

559
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,920
#You never had a friend like me#

560
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,480
#Yes sir
We pride ourselves on service#

561
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,640
#You are the boss, the king, the shah#

562
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,360
#Say what you want
It's yours, the real dish#

563
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,920
#How about more baklava#?

564
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,200
#Take A from column
Try Full Column B#

565
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,840
#I'm in the mood to help you man#

566
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,080
#You never had a friend like me#

567
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,840
#Butter #

568
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,040
#No no#

569
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,360
#Ohhh#

570
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,280
#Can your friends do this#?

571
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,200
#Can your friends do this#?

572
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
#Can your friends shoot this#

573
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,160
#She took out her little hat#?

574
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,560
#Can your friends go to bed#?

575
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,240
Hey, look here. Haha!

576
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,720
#Can your friends go
Abracadabra let it rip #

577
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
#And then make that lollipop disappear#

578
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,600
#So don't just sit there
Soft chin, wild eyes#

579
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
#I'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers#

580
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,840
#You have certified me in good faith#

581
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,200
#You are a genius
For your business manager#

582
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,560
#I have a strong desire to help you#

583
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,040
#What is your wish
I really want to know#

584
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,720
#You have a list
It's probably three miles long#

585
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,920
#All you have to do is massage like this#

586
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,680
#Herra. Aladdin, sir
I have a wish or two or three#

587
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,120
#I'm at work big mogul#

588
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,120
#You've never had a friend
I've never had a friend#

589
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,360
#You've never had a friend
I've never had a friend#

590
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
#you never are#

591
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
#I had#

592
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,240
#friend#

593
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
#Like#

594
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,240
#I#

595
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,400
Ah ha ha!

596
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,920
Wah ha ha!

597
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,720
#You never had a friend like me#

598
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,440
Eh?

599
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,560
So what will it be, master?

600
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,800
You give me
three wishes what i want right?

601
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh, almost.

602
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,160
There are some reservations,
some allowances.

603
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,200
Like?

604
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,600
Ah, rule number one:
I can't kill anyone.

605
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,880
So don't ask.

606
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,280
Rule number two.

607
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,200
I can't make anyone
fall in love with someone else.

608
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,200
You're a little punisher there.

609
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,400
Rule number three. I can't bring
people come back from the dead.

610
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,600
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing that.

611
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,880
Otherwise, there you have it.

612
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,680
- Hmm.
- I see!

613
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,680
Reservations?
Do you mean boundaries?

614
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
based on wishes?
An almighty genius.

615
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,240
I can't even bring people
back from the dead.

616
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,840
I don't know, Abu. It probably is
I can't even get us out of this cave.

617
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,040
Looks like we have to
find a way out.

618
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,000
Sorry?

619
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,920
Are you looking at me?
Are you rubbing my lamp?

620
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,680
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

621
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,680
And you cheated on me?

622
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,840
I do not believe,
not right away.

623
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
You will get your wish,
so sit down!

624
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,480
- In an emergency,

625
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,800
the exits are here, here,
here, here, wherever.

626
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,400
Hold hands and arms
inside the carpet.

627
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,360
Were you...

628
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,880
out of here!

629
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,280
Jafar, it's a scandal.

630
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,240
If it weren't for all your years
good and loyal service...

631
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,200
From now on, we need to discuss
judging prisoners with me,

632
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,720
before their heads were beheaded.

633
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,640
I assure you, Your Highness,
this will not happen again.

634
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
Jasmine...

635
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,880
Jafar. Let's put everything
complicated matters behind us.

636
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,000
Please.

637
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,000
My apologies and most humble apologies
you too, princess.

638
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,200
At least something good will come
that I was forced to marry.

639
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,240
When I'm queen, I get
strength to get rid of you.

640
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,440
It's good.
So everything was agreed.

641
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,600
Now, Jasmine, let's get back to it
this suitor thing...Jasmine?

642
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,760
Jasmine!

643
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,360
I wish I had this lamp.

644
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,560
“I have power
get rid of you. »

645
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,520
To think
we have to keep kissing

646
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,400
to this idiot
and his stupid daughter

647
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,040
- the rest of our lives...
- No, Lake.

648
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,560
Only until he finds
stupid husband

649
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,440
Then he gets us a banana.

650
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,000
Or were beaten.

651
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,920
Wow!

652
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
I see. Wait a moment.

653
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
Jafar. And if you were
idiot husband?

654
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,920
What?

655
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,400
Okay, you're getting married
princess, okay?

656
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,080
And then you
to become a sultan.

657
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,440
I see.

658
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,960
Marry a snot.

659
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,360
I will be the Sultan.

660
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,320
- The idea is meritorious.
- Yes, it deserves it. Yeah.

661
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:56,040
And then we let the stepfather down
and the little woman on the edge of the cliff.

662
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,560
Joo !

663
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Christmas plate!

664
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,280
I like the way
your dirty little mind works.

665
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,640
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

666
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,320
Don't stand by the mat
has completely stopped.

667
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,360
THANK YOU.
Goodbye now. Good yes.

668
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,480
THANK YOU.

669
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,480
Well, how about this,
M. Do you suspect Mustafa?

670
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,200
Oh, you showed me that well.
Now for my three wishes.

671
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,360
Are my ears failing me?

672
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,760
Three. You're one point behind, son.

673
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,440
Oh no. I never really hoped
to get out of the cave.

674
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,200
You did it alone.

675
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,920
Well, I feel stupid.

676
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,120
All right you baaad boy
but no more gifts.

677
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,360
Fair trade.
Three wishes, then.

678
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,360
I want them to be good.

679
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,080
What would you like to?

680
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,040
I?

681
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,240
No one has ever asked me that before.

682
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,120
Well in my case...
Ah, forget it.

683
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,080
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

684
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,360
Come on. Tell me.

685
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,520
Freedom.

686
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,400
Are you a prisoner?

687
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,840
All of this is an essential part
the whole genius concert.

688
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,480
Phenomenal Cosmic Powers...

689
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,880
Very small living space.

690
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,040
Genius, this is terrible.

691
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,520
But oh, to be free.

692
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,840
No need to go there
"Huh huh. What do you need?

693
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

694
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,360
To be my own master.

695
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,080
That would be it
greater than all magic

696
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,720
and all the treasures
In the whole world.

697
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,600
But what am I talking about?
Let's be real here.

698
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,040
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

699
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,200
Genius, wake up and smell the hummus.

700
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,560
Why not?

701
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,320
The only way to get out
if my master wants me to go.

702
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,680
So you can guess how often
it happened.

703
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,400
I will do it. I will set you free.

704
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,640
- Uh-huh, that's true.
- Not really, I promise.

705
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,440
after my first two wishes,

706
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,680
I use my third wish
to set you free.

707
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,760
Well, I hope so.
Clear.

708
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,080
Let's make magic.

709
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,760
So what is it?
What do you want most?

710
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,520
Well, there's this girl.

711
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,840
Fake.

712
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,360
I can't make anyone
falling in love, remember?

713
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,840
But, genius,

714
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,720
he's smart and funny and...

715
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,680
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

716
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,160
He has these eyes that...
and that hair. Wow.

717
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,480
And her smile...

718
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,760
Am I.

719
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,880
It's love.

720
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
But she is a princess.

721
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,920
To even have a chance,
I should be...

722
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,800
Hey, can you make me a prince?

723
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,320
Let's see here.

724
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,080
Royal chicken? No.

725
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,240
Alaskan king crab.
Ouch. I hate it when they do that.

726
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,840
Caesar salad. Ah!
And you, Brute. No.

727
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,000
Haha. "Make a prince."

728
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,200
Is this an official wish?
Say the magic words.

729
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,000
Genius, I wish you
make me a prince

730
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,680
Clear!

731
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,040
Eh heh! Frame! Frame!

732
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,320
First, this Fez and vest combination
it is too third century.

733
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,680
These corrections.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

734
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,160
No, let's work with me here.

735
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Oops. I like this. Very macho.

736
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,040
Now he needs something else.
What does that tell me?

737
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,800
It's about the means of transportation.

738
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,600
Sorry, little monkey.
Whom. Like this.

739
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,520
- Oh no.
- Well, here he is.

740
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,560
What better way to make your own
entering the streets of Agrabah

741
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,360
like riding alone
a new camel.

742
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Attention. They spit.
Mmmm. Not enough.

743
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,800
It's still not enough.

744
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,560
Wait and see.
What do you need?

745
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,160
Joo!

746
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,480
Esalalumbo Shimin Dumbo.

747
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,480
Wow!

748
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Talk about your trunk.
Check this function.

749
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,480
Abu, you look good.

750
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,960
He has an outfit.
He has an elephant.

751
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,920
But we're not done yet.

752
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,440
Hold on to your turban, son.
We will make you a star.

753
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,480
Sir i found the solution
your daughter's problem.

754
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,000
Alright. The problem with your daughter.

755
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,240
Really?

756
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,400
Here.

757
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,280
“If the princess has not chosen
husband at an agreed time,

758
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,560
so the Sultan must
complain to him. »

759
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,360
But Jasmine hated
all these suitors.

760
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,560
How could I choose
someone he hates?

761
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,480
Don't worry, sir.
There's more.

762
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,360
“if in the event
we can't find a suitable prince"

763
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,400
Jerk.

764
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,320
"Then the princess must marry..."

765
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,680
Hmm. Interesting.

766
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,440
What? WHO?

767
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,080
Royal Visor.

768
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,520
Well, that would be... me.

769
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,280
But I thought the law said

770
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,600
that only the prince
can marry a princess.

771
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,120
I am pretty sure...

772
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,920
Desperate times call
desperate measures, my lord.

773
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,040
Yeah. Desperate measures.

774
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,080
You will order
princess marry me

775
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,320
I order...

776
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,000
Princess...

777
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,200
on...

778
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,600
But you are so old.

779
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,960
The princess will marry me.

780
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,600
The princess is getting married...

781
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,360
- What. What is this?

782
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,760
This music.

783
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,760
Jafar, you must come
and look at this.

784
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,960
#Make way for Prince Ali#

785
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,280
#Say Hello#

786
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,560
#It's Prince Ali#

787
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,560
#Hey lead the way in the old bazaar#

788
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,280
#Hey you, let us pass
It's a new shining star#

789
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,480
#Oh come on, be the first in your neighborhood
meet his eyes#

790
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,840
#Make way, here it is
Ring the bells, beat the drums#

791
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,440
#You will love this man#

792
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,840
#PrinceAli, wonderful he is
Ali Ababwa#

793
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,280
#Genuflec, show respect
on your knees#

794
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,640
#Now do your best to stay calm#

795
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,240
#Update Sunday Salam#

796
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,880
#So come and meet
Her amazing group#

797
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,720
#PrinceAli, he is powerful,
Ali Ababwa#

798
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,640
#Strong than ten ordinary men, definitely#

799
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,440
#He galloped against the herds#

800
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,680
#A hundred evils with swords#

801
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,560
#Who sent these idiots to their masters
Why, Prince Ali#

802
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,240
#He has 75 golden camels#

803
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,720
Aren't they lovely, June?

804
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,320
#Purple peacocks, she has 53#

805
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,200
Great, Harry.
I love feathers.

806
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,800
#When it comes to exotic mammals#

807
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,120
#Does it have a zoo
I will tell you#

808
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,640
#It's a world class zoo#

809
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,400
#PrinceAli, he is handsome
Ali Ababwa#

810
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,160
#This physics how can I talk
weak knee#

811
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,920
#Well, get out of there#

812
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
#Adjust the veil and get ready#

813
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,040
#Staring, crawling and staring
Prince Alissa#

814
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,800
- #He has 95 white Persian monkeys#
- #He has monkeys#

815
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,920
- #Let's watch monkeys#
- #And there is no charge to see them#

816
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,240
#He has slaves
He has servants and minions#

817
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,000
#Proud to work for him
They bend to his whims, love to serve him#

818
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,120
#They just suck loyalty to Ali#

819
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,080
#Prince Ali#

820
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:41,040
#PrinceAli, he's in love
Ali Ababwa#

821
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,560
#I heard your princess
It was a pleasant sight #

822
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,880
#And that, folks, is why#

823
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,560
#She dressed and went over#

824
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,360
#60 with an elephant, llamas galore#

825
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,360
#withbears and lions,
Fanfare and more#

826
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,240
#40 with the fakir,
Its cooks, its bakers#

827
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,640
#her bird is chirping on the side#

828
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,760
#Make room#

829
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,880
#for Prince Ali#

830
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,240
Brilliant.
Absolutely awesome.

831
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,520
Your Highness,

832
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,400
I have traveled far and wide
seek your daughter's hand.

833
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,400
Prince Ali Ababwa.

834
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,000
Of course.
Nice to meet you.

835
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,160
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He is also happy.

836
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,360
Ecstatic.

837
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,120
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
-Above.

838
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,480
Forget it.

839
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,400
You can't just roll here
uninvited and waiting...

840
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,640
Allah, it definitely is
remarkable device.

841
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,160
Wake up.

842
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,720
I don't think I could...

843
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,320
Of course, Your Majesty.
I can.

844
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,360
Sir, I must advise you not to do this.

845
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,560
Shut up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

846
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,120
AIE AIE AIE.

847
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,400
Ahhh! Wow!

848
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,920
Where did you say
where were you from

849
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,800
Oh, much further than
you've traveled, I'm sure.

850
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,760
- Try me.
- Be careful, Polly.

851
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,800
Hey, check this out.

852
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,920
Look at him with that stupid carpet.

853
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,880
Ah!

854
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Huh huh!

855
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,520
Out of the way.
I'm coming to the country.

856
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,000
Jafar, look at this.

857
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,320
- Impressive, Your Highness.
- It was wonderful.

858
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,240
Yes, it seems to me
have talent for it.

859
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,560
This is a very impressive youth.

860
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,920
And a prince at that.

861
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,400
If we're lucky, you won't
I must eventually marry Jasmine.

862
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,080
- I don't trust him, sir.
- It's absurd.

863
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,240
I am proud of one thing, Jafar,

864
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,240
I am an excellent judge of character.

865
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,240
Oh, excellent judge.
Of course. No!

866
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,360
Jasmine likes this.

867
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,840
And I'm pretty sure
I would like Princess Jasmine.

868
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,600
Your Highness, no.
I have to speak for Jasmine.

869
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,720
This boy is no different
other.

870
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,640
Which makes him think
Is she worthy of a princess?

871
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,480
Your Highness,
I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

872
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,720
Let him meet me.
I will win your daughter.

873
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,160
How dare you.

874
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,000
You all. Standing
decide my future?

875
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,760
I am not a prize to be won.

876
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,200
Ohhh.

877
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,600
Don't worry, Prince Ali.

878
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,200
Give Jasmine time
cool.

879
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,320
I think it's time to say goodbye
to Prince Abouboo.

880
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,840
What do I do?

881
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,000
Jasmine doesn't even do that
let me talk to him.

882
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,640
I should have known I couldn't get away with this
this stupid prince wishes.

883
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,360
So get moving.

884
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,320
Hey.

885
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,600
It's a good decision.

886
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,160
I can not believe it.
I lose to all-in.

887
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,400
Genius, I need help.

888
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,440
All right, Sparky,
here's the deal.

889
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,440
If you want to go to court
little lady,

890
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,360
you must be
straight shooter.

891
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,280
- Did you get it?
- What?

892
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,400
Tell him...

893
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,240
-...truth!
- Not at all.

894
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,960
If Jasmine found out I really am
dirty street rat,

895
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,000
he would laugh at me.

896
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,440
A woman appreciates a man
who makes him laugh.

897
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,480
Al, kidding aside,
you should really be yourself.

898
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,480
Hey, that's the last thing I want to be.

899
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,440
Okay, I'll go see him.

900
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,960
I just... I have to be gentle,
cool, confident.

901
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
How do I look?

902
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,280
Like a prince.

903
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,560
Princess Jasmine?

904
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,480
- Who's here?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

905
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,800
Hmm. Oh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

906
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,520
I do not want to see you.

907
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
No, no, please, princess.
Give me a chance.

908
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,480
- Leave me alone.
- Down, cat.

909
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,960
How is our little friend?

910
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,640
Good cat, take it away.

911
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,120
Alas, kitty.

912
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,200
Wait. Wait.

913
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,600
I know you?

914
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,000
No. No.

915
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,200
You remind me of something
I met at the market.

916
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,680
Market?

917
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,520
I have servants who go
to the market for me.

918
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,600
Well, I even have servants who visit
my servant's market.

919
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,800
You met not me.

920
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,360
No, I guess not.

921
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,920
Enough of you, Casanova.
Talk about him.

922
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,640
He is smart, funny,
hair, eyes.

923
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,200
Nothing. Select a feature.

924
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,080
Hmm. Princess Jasmine?
You are very...

925
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,360
- Wonderful, wonderful, precise.
-...precise.

926
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,520
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

927
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,800
- Um, beautiful.
- Get well soon.

928
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,880
Hmm.

929
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,080
I'm rich too, you know.

930
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,960
- Joo.
- The Sultan's daughter.

931
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,960
I know.

932
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,520
Great price
for the prince to marry.

933
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,440
That is true. PROPERLY.
A prince like me.

934
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,640
Warning! Warning!

935
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,720
PROPERLY. A prince like you.

936
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,160
And all the other sweatshirts,
a fluttering peacock I met.

937
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,760
Car! Car!

938
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,360
Just jump
balcony!

939
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,520
- What?
- Stop him. Stop him!

940
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,840
- Do you want me to poke him?
- Go out.

941
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,400
OK very good.
But remember the "bee" itself.

942
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,200
- Really.
- What?

943
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,400
Er... Er, you're right.

944
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,520
You're not just
prize to be won.

945
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,280
You should be free
make your own choice.

946
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,600
I'll go now.

947
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,440
- No!
- What? What?

948
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,720
How...

949
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,240
How do you do this?

950
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,800
- It's a flying carpet.
- It is wonderful.

951
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,680
You...

952
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,960
You don't want to go
let's go, right?

953
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,200
We could leave the palace,
see the world.

954
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,320
- Is it safe?
- Of course. Do you trust me?

955
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,040
- What?
- Do you trust me?

956
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,480
Joo.

957
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:15,880
Joo.

958
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,560
#I can show you the world#

959
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,800
#Brilliant, Shining, Gorgeous#

960
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,400
#Tell me princess#

961
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,200
#When was the last time you did
Let your heart decide#

962
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,080
#I can open my eyes#

963
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,360
#Surprise yourself with a miracle#

964
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,120
#above, sideways and below#

965
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,920
#on the magic carpet#

966
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,680
#Whole new world#

967
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,280
#Great New Perspective#

968
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,840
#No one says no to us
Or where to go#

969
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,520
#Or let's say we're just dreaming#

970
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,280
#Whole new world#

971
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,240
#Amazing place
I never knew#

972
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,600
#But when I'm up there
It's crystal clear#

973
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,880
#That now I'm involved
A whole new world with you#

974
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,160
#Now I'm in
A whole new world with you#

975
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,000
#Amazing Sites#

976
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,480
#indescribable feeling#

977
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,480
#Rising, Bouncing, Free Spinning#

978
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,520
#Through the endless diamond sky#

979
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,000
- #Whole new world#
- #Don't you dare close your eyes#

980
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,280
- #Hundreds to see#
- #Hold your breath, it will get better#

981
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,720
#I'm like a shooting star
i came this far#

982
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,000
#I can't go back to where I was#

983
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,800
- #Whole new world#
- #Every turn is a surprise#

984
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,520
- #Aiming for new horizons#
- #Every moment, a red letter#

985
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,960
#I chase them anywhere
There's time to lose #

986
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,480
#Let me share
This whole new world with you#

987
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,360
- #Whole new world#
- #Whole new world#

988
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,240
- #Here we will be#
- #Here we will be#

989
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,960
- #Exciting Chase#
- #lovely place#

990
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,840
#For you and me#

991
00 :57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,120
- It's so magical.
- Joo.

992
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,040
Annoyance
Abu must have missed this.

993
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,200
No. He hates fireworks.

994
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,200
He doesn't like to fly either.

995
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,000
That is...
Oh no.

996
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,160
You are a boy from the market.
I knew it.

997
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,640
- Why did you lie?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

998
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,560
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

999
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,480
- That I wouldn't understand?
- No.

1000
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,160
I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

1001
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,160
Who are you?
Tell the truth.

1002
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,000
Truth?

1003
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,360
Truth. Um...

1004
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,720
The truth is...

1005
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,400
Sometimes I dress like normal...

1006
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,000
escape pressure
of palace life.

1007
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,520
But I really am a prince.

1008
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,000
Why didn't you tell me?

1009
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,640
Well, you know...

1010
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,840
royalty will come out
in the city in disguise,

1011
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,640
feels a little weird
you do not believe?

1012
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,320
Hmm.

1013
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,800
Not so weird.

1014
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,520
Good night, handsome prince.

1015
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,280
Sleep well, princess.

1016
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,960
Joo!

1017
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,360
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go well.

1018
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,440
Ashes. Ashes.

1019
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,600
Keep it.

1020
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,480
I'm afraid you're exhausted
welcome, prince Abooboo.

1021
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,960
Why you...

1022
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,160
Make sure it's never found.

1023
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,840
Never fail. Take a bath
and there is a problem with the lamp.

1024
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,360
Good morning? Al?

1025
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,000
Al! Kid, stop it.

1026
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,600
You can't fake this.
I can't help you unless you wish.

1027
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,600
You must say, "Genius,
I want you to save my life.” Do you understand?

1028
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,920
Come on, Aladdin!

1029
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,360
I'll take it.

1030
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,240
Superior reach.

1031
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,040
Don't scare me like that.

1032
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,600
Genius, I...

1033
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,760
I...

1034
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,440
- Thanks, Genie.
- You Al.

1035
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,640
I'm starting to like you, boy.

1036
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,240
It's not that I want to choose
curtains or something.

1037
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,000
Jasmine.

1038
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,120
Oh dad, I just had
the most wonderful moment.

1039
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,240
- I am so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

1040
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,600
I chose a man for you.

1041
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,400
- What?
- You will marry Jafar.

1042
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,960
You are speechless, I see.

1043
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,840
A great quality in a wife.

1044
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,680
I will never marry you.

1045
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,360
- Dad, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali is gone.

1046
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,600
Better check yours
another crystal ball, Jafar.

1047
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,320
Prince Ali!

1048
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,960
How... um. Ouch!

1049
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,480
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to kill me.

1050
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,560
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

1051
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,760
He is clearly lying.

1052
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,200
Obviously lying.

1053
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Dad, what's wrong with you?

1054
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,080
I know what's wrong.

1055
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,120
Oh no!

1056
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,640
Jafar controls you with this.

1057
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,560
What? Jafar?

1058
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,520
You traitor!

1059
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,720
Your Highness,
all this can be explained.

1060
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,600
Guards! Guards!

1061
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,240
Well, that's it.
They were dead. Forget it.

1062
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,400
Just dig a grave for both of us.
They were dead.

1063
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,800
Terminate Jafar immediately.

1064
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,280
It's not done yet, son.

1065
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,360
Etsi se!

1066
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,160
- Search everywhere!
-Jasmine, are you okay?

1067
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,160
Joo.

1068
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,520
Jafar, my most trusted advisor,

1069
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,600
been plotting against me all this time.

1070
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,720
It's horrible, just horrible.

1071
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,960
How could I ever...

1072
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,960
Eh?

1073
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,720
Could this be true?

1074
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,280
My daughter finally
chose a suitor?

1075
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,440
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

1076
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,360
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.

1077
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,560
I will not do it.
I'll leave it to my...

1078
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,320
But you get married at the same time.

1079
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,000
Yes Yes. And you will be happy
and prosperous,

1080
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,160
and then you, my son,
will be the Sultan.

1081
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,560
-Sultan?
- Joo.

1082
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,680
A handsome, honest young man
like you,

1083
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,120
your person
impeccable moral character

1084
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,560
This is exactly what this kingdom needs.

1085
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,120
We have to get out of here.

1086
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,480
Gotta start packing.
Only essentials.

1087
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,840
We must travel light.

1088
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,720
Bring the guns, the guns,
and what do you think of this picture?

1089
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,480
I think I'll make a weird face with it.

1090
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,680
Oh no. It's broken.
He went crazy.

1091
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,800
Jafar! Jafar!

1092
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,200
Hold on!

1093
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,080
Good adhesion.

1094
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,920
Prince Ali is nothing but
that ragged boy, Aladdin.

1095
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,120
- He has a lamp, Lago.
- Well, this poor...

1096
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,840
But you will
to release him.

1097
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,840
I?

1098
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,440
Sultan?

1099
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,560
They want me to be their sultan?

1100
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,560
Huzzah!

1101
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,280
#Hail to the Conquering Hero#

1102
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,480
Aladdin, you just won
princess heart

1103
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,560
What are you going to do next?

1104
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,120
Psst Your line is,
"I'm going to let life go."

1105
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Whenever.

1106
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,520
- Genius. I can not.
- Of course you can.

1107
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,960
Go forward,
"Genius, I wish you freedom."

1108
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,040
I'm serious.

1109
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,960
Look, I'm sorry. I'm really.
But they want to make me Sultan.

1110
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,520
No, they want to do
Prince Ali Sultan.

1111
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,800
Without you,
I'm just Aladdin.

1112
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,920
- Al, you win.
- Because of you.

1113
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,280
The only reason we think
I'm worth everything, it's because of you.

1114
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,440
And if they find out
Am I really not a prince?

1115
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,280
What if Jasmine found out?
i would lose it.

1116
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,480
Genius, I can't
keep it to myself.

1117
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,200
I cannot wish you freedom.

1118
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,960
GOOD. I understand.
You lied to everyone.

1119
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,720
Hey, I'm starting to feel left out.

1120
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,200
Now will you excuse me, master.

1121
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,800
Genius, I'm so sorry.

1122
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,520
GOOD.
So hang in there.

1123
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,400
What are you watching?

1124
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,520
Look, I... I'm sorry.

1125
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,560
Abu, I'm sorry. I do not have...

1126
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,560
Wait. Come on.

1127
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,160
What am I doing?

1128
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,680
Nero is right.

1129
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,160
I have to tell Jasmine the truth.

at 11:30 a.m
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,440
Wings. You Ali.
Are you coming here?

1131
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,800
Well, that's it.

1132
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,960
Jasmine?
Where are you?

1133
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,720
In Menager. Hurry up.

1134
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,760
I am coming.

1135
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,320
Got a problem, Pinky?

1136
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,040
Jerk.

1137
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,440
Boy, Jafar is glad to see you.

1138
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,320
- Great job, Lago.
- Go on.

1139
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,320
Not really. In scale
from one to ten, you are eleven.

1140
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,760
Oh Jafar, you are so kind.

1141
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,680
I'm embarrassed.
I'm blushing.

1142
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,520
People of Agrabah,

1143
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,560
my daughter finally
chose a suitor.

1144
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,000
Jasmine.

1145
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,960
Ali, where have you been?

1146
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,200
Jasmine, there is something
I have to tell you.

1147
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,120
The whole kingdom has turned
For the Proclamation of the Father.

1148
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,400
No, but Jasmine, listen to me.

1149
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,400
- You do not understand...
- Congratulations.

1150
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,200
...He's a Dog!

1151
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,880
Oh no.

1152
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,520
Look at them,
clapping this little pipe.

1153
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:29,680
Let them clap.

1154
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,800
Let them clap.

1155
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,720
You know, Al, I'm really...

1156
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,200
I don't think you're him.
Tonight Ali's role

1157
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,440
present tall and dark
and an ominous ugly man.

1158
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,240
- I am your master now.
- That's what I was afraid of.

1159
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,200
Genie, grant me my first wish.

1160
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,960
I want to rule on high as a sultan.

1161
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,920
- Wow!
- Bless my soul.

1162
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,800
What is this?

1163
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,880
What is happening?
Oh my god, what's going on?

1164
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,920
Father.

1165
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,000
Jafar, you vile traitor.

1166
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,920
For you, it's Sultan Vile Betrayer.

1167
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Indeed?
We'll see only then.

1168
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,840
A lamp.

1169
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,160
Guardians of the Finders, Abooboo.

1170
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,400
Genius, no!

1171
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,920
Sorry, son.
I now have a new master.

1172
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,040
Jafar, I'm telling you to stop.

1173
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,160
Ah, but now there is a new order.

1174
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,960
My order.

1175
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,960
Finally you bow to me.

1176
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,880
We will never bow down to you.

1177
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,000
Why am I not surprised?

1178
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,440
If you do not bow to the Sultan,

1179
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,560
then you bow
in front of the wizard!

1180
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,840
Genius, my second wish...

1181
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,080
I want to be the most powerful wizard
in the world!

1182
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,040
Genius, stop!

1183
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

1184
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,320
a warm welcome to Agrabah
old Jafarille!

1185
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,280
Where were we now?

1186
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,800
Yes. Gross humiliation.

1187
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,920
Down there, son.

1188
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,200
Oh princess.

1189
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,040
There is someone I will die with
to introduce you.

1190
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,640
Jafar. Do not touch her.

1191
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,640
#PrinceAli
yes it's him#

1192
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,760
#But not as you know#

1193
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,880
#Read my lips
And face reality#

1194
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,960
#Yes, meet a blast from your past#

1195
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,400
#whose lies were too good to last#

1196
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,800
#Say Hello
To my dear Prince Ali#

1197
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,360
Or should we say Aladdin?

1198
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,400
Ali?

1199
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,560
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I am fair...

1200
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,880
#So Ali turns out to be
Simply Aladdin#

1201
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,000
#Just a scam, shall I continue#

1202
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,280
#Believe me#

1203
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,520
#her personality flaw#

1204
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,560
#give me a valid reason#

1205
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,400
#Send him packing
With a one-way ticket#

1206
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,720
#So its future prospects
Make a terminal dive#

1207
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,760
#His frozen assets, selected location
It's the end of the world, oops!#

1208
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,120
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye, see you soon.

1209
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:30,040
#Former Prince Ali#

1210
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,640
Abu.

1211
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,760
Abu!

1212
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,680
Oh, this is all my fault.

1213
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,760
I should have released the spirit
when I had the chance. Abu.

1214
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,160
- Do you agree?
- Mm-hmm.

1215
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,080
I'm sorry, Abu.

1216
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,760
I mixed it up.

1217
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,280
One way or another... I have to go back
and make things right.

1218
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,720
Carpet.

1219
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,240
Abu, start digging.

1220
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,360
That's it.

1221
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,800
Yeah! Clear!

1222
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,640
Now back to Agrabah.
Let's go.

1223
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,040
Puppet leader wants cookies?

1224
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,800
Here are your cookies.
Shoved in the back of the throat.

1225
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,120
Here. Get a lot.

1226
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,680
Stop that.
Jafar, leave him alone.

1227
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,560
It hurts me to see you
minus that, Jasmine.

1228
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,760
A beautiful desert bloom
like you

1229
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,520
should be most in the arm
powerful man in the world.

1230
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,440
What do you say, darling?

1231
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,160
Why, when you're the queen...

1232
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Never.

1233
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,840
I'm going to teach you respect.

1234
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,600
Hey Genie.

1235
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,040
I have decided to
make my last wish.

1236
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,000
I wish Princess Jasmine

1237
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,920
to fall in despair
in love with me

1238
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,320
Ah, master, there are some additions,
compensation...

1239
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,360
don't answer me
you big blue thug.

1240
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,240
What are you going to do
I command you to do it, slave.

1241
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,160
Jafar.

1242
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,880
I never realized how much...
You are unbelievable beautiful.

1243
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,120
Mmmm. It `s better.

1244
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,760
Now the cat...

1245
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,720
tell me more about myself.

1246
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,680
You are tall...

1247
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,000
dark...

1248
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,000
well dressed...

1249
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,320
Al. Al, the boyfriend.

1250
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,840
Shh

1251
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,560
Al, I can't help you.

1252
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,280
I now work for Señor Psychopath.
What are you going to do?

1253
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,240
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'm going to improvise.

1254
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,720
...nice little openings
between the teeth.

1255
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,640
Jack.

1256
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,160
And your beard...

1257
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,240
is so... twisted.

1258
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,400
- You stole my heart.
-He knows...!

1259
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,000
- What about a street rat?

1260
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,720
What street rat?

1261
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,080
Joo !

1262
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,280
It was...

1263
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,400
You!

1264
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,560
How many times
should I kill you, my son?

1265
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,880
Get a lamp.

1266
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,880
No!

1267
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,520
Ah, ah, ah, prinsessa.
Your time is up.

1268
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,200
Jasmine.

1269
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,880
Nice picture Jaf...

1270
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,680
Don't play with me.

1271
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,120
Abu!

1272
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,400
Things fall apart
hurry now, my boy.

1273
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,800
Understand?

1274
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,120
I'm just warming up.

1275
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,520
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1276
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,400
A snake, right?

1277
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,080
Maybe you'd like to see
how much I can look like a snake.

1278
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,960
#Rick'em, rack'em, rock'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake#

1279
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,520
Stay away from it.

1280
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,840
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... that's fine!

1281
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,520
Aladdin.

1282
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,840
Jasmine, wait.

1283
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,960
You little idiot.

1284
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,120
You thought you could win
the most powerful being on earth.

1285
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,280
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze it like... Awk!

1286
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:32,200
Without genius, my son,
you are nothing

1287
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,320
Nero. Nero.

1288
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,120
Geniuses have more power
which you will never have.

1289
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,200
What?

1290
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,560
He gave you your strength.
He can take it off.

1291
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,240
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

1292
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,920
Admit it, Jafar.
You're still only in second place.

1293
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,240
You are right.

1294
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,960
His strength surpasses mine.

1295
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,040
But not for long.

1296
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:59,120
The boy is crazy.
He's a little drunk.

1297
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,720
One shot too many with a snake.

1298
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,560
Slave, I make my third wish.

1299
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,720
I want to be
almighty genius!

1300
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,880
Fine, your wish is my command.
Well done, Al.

1301
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,240
Joo.

1302
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,040
Joo!

1303
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,680
Power.

1304
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,400
Absolute power!

1305
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,560
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1306
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,560
The universe belongs to me
control!

1307
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,280
Not so fast, Jafar.
Don't you forget something?

1308
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,520
- Ai?
- You wanted to be a genius...

1309
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,840
you figured it out.

1310
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,120
What?

1311
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,440
And everything that goes with it.

1312
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,920
- No! No!
- I'm getting out of here.

1313
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,920
Phenomenal Cosmic Powers...

1314
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You are a genius. I dont want...

1315
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,320
Very small living space.

1316
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,480
Al, you little genius, you.

1317
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,720
Ahh!

1318
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,200
Shut your mouth
out of my face.

1319
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,400
- Shut up, fool.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1320
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,720
I can.

1321
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,000
10,000 years in the cave of wonders
that should calm him down.

1322
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,120
Shut up!

1323
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,960
Jasmine...

1324
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,400
I'm sorry for lying to you
about being a prince.

1325
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,000
I know why you did it.

1326
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,640
I fancy...

1327
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,560
Is this okay?

1328
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,720
Oh this stupid law.
It's not fair.

1329
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,360
I love you.

1330
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,200
Al, it's okay.

1331
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,160
You have one more wish left.

1332
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,360
Sano vain sana
and you are a prince again.

1333
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,360
But, genius,
what about your freedom

1334
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,400
Hey, it's just
an eternity of slavery.

1335
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,360
It's love.

1336
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,640
Al, you won't find another girl
than him in a million years.

1337
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,400
Believe me, I know.
I looked.

1338
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,120
Jasmine, I love you,

1339
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,880
but i have to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1340
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,160
I understand.

1341
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,760
Genius, I desire your freedom.

1342
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,800
Real
the prince's pedigree is forthcoming.

1343
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,600
- What?
- Genius, you're free.

1344
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,680
I am free. I am free.

1345
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,160
Quickly. Quickly.
Hope for something extraordinary.

1346
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,360
Say, "I want the Nile." Try this.

1347
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,120
- I hope for Niili.
- Never!

1348
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,080
Oh, does it feel good! I see!

1349
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:15,280
I am free! I'm finally free!

1350
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,720
I'm about to hit the road.
I'm going to see the world.

1351
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,480
I am...

1352
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,440
Genius, I am...

1353
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,000
I will miss you.

1354
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,240
Me too, Al.

1355
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,280
Forget it
what someone says

1356
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,280
you will always be a prince to me.

1357
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,400
Properly.

1358
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,280
You have certainly proven your worth
what comes to me.

1359
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,640
This is the law
This is the problem.

1360
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,840
- Dad?
- Well, am I a sultan or am I a sultan?

1361
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,440
From this day on,

1362
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,000
the princess is getting married
which he considers worthy.

1363
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,440
Him. I choose...

1364
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,880
I choose you, Aladdin.

1365
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,760
Call me Al.

1366
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,240
Oh all of you, come here.
Big group hug.

1367
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,840
Group hug.

1368
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,800
Do you mind if I kiss a monkey?

1369
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,120
Oh hairball.

1370
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,120
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

1371
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,080
I'm leaving!

1372
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,480
Goodbye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1373
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,280
Hey, Rugman, hi.
I am the story.

1374
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,840
No, I'm mythology.

1375
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,800
I don't care what I am. I am free!

1376
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,120
#Whole new world#

1377
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,600
#Whole new life#

1378
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,160
#For you and me#

1379
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,480
#Whole new world #?

1380
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,400
Made you watch.

ALADDIN
In a faraway land where the sun burned the desert to flames, there was an ancient secret.
It's a long-forgotten lamp buried deep under the sand.
It's small and simple.
It does not have fancy designs and does not contain precious jewelry.
To all but the wisest of us, this would seem boring and worthless.
But this lamp is not what it seems.
A long time ago, he had the greatest power in the entire land of Arabia.
It was magic that changed the young man's life forever.
A young man who, like the lamp, was more than he seemed.
The story begins on a dark night where a dark man waits with a dark purpose. . . .
CHAPTER ONE
This man's name was Jafar and he was willing to wait.
His piercing eyes and pointed turban made him look like a cobra about to strike.
Perched on his shoulder, the parrot cocked its head impatiently.
Below him, his horse shifted and grunted in exasperation.
The treasure was buried somewhere there.
Only one person could find it: the one with the two halves of the ancient scarab.
Jafar had half, and soon he would have the other.
The treasure would then belong to him.
And with this, he would become the most powerful man in Agrabah.
In the silence, Jafar heard the click of hooves as a rider approached.
The man was a common thief named Gazeem, and he had agreed
bring Jafar the other half of the scarab in exchange for part of the treasure.
Jafar had promised. Jafar lied.
"You're late," he said.
Gazeem dismounted and bowed his head.
Jafar was the royal vizier, the sultan's chief advisor. It wasn't wise to upset him.
"Forgive me, O patient one," Gazeem said.
Jafar looked at him. "Have you got it then?" »
Smiling, the thief took half of the beetle out of his pocket.
Jafar grabbed him, but the thief held him back.
"And the treasure? You promised me that."
Yell!
The parrot came down from Jafar's shoulder, grabbed the beetle and dropped it on Jafar's bones.
hand.
"Trust me," Jafar said. "You get what's coming to you."
He quickly took half of the beetle.
He felt his blood rush as he put the halves together.
They shone. SO...
BOOMOOOM!
Thunder shook the desert.
The scarab burst from Jafar's hand as if it were alive.
He crossed the dunes in a burst of light.
Jafar urged his horse.
"Quick, follow the path!" He shouted.
Gazeem mounted his own horse and ran after Jafar.
Shining like a comet, the beetle headed for a small sandstone rock.
He circled it and then stopped in mid-air.
Crack!
The beetle split in half again and burrowed into the rock, each half getting stuck in a small
hole.
Jafar stopped his horse and jumped.
The throbbing beetle stared at him like a huge pair of eyes.
An exhilarating excitement came over him.
There was no going back now.
RRRRRRRMMMMmm!
The ground began to shake.
Strange eyes flashed wildly.
Gazeem collapsed with fear.
Little by little the stone started to grow.
It expanded in all directions and changed shape.
The eyes remained, and now the ears formed, then the nose.
In the end, the mouth was large and gaping.
A pillar of white light erupted from within, nearly blinding Jafar.
The stone was now the face of a tiger, frozen in a furious, silent roar.
Jafar looked at him in astonishment.
Her frightened parrot grabbed her shoulder, digging in its claws.
"By Allah!" Gazeem whispered. "Tiger God!"
"Finally, lago!" Jafar said to his parrot. "After all my years of research, the Cave of Wonders!"
"Awk" Lago yelled. "The Cave of Wonders!"
Jafar pulled Gazeem closer to him.
"Now remember," he growled.
“Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!"
Gazeem swallowed hard.
He turned towards the tiger god's mouth and began to walk slowly.
"Awk! The lamp!" Lago repeated loud enough for Gazeem to hear.
Then he leaned into Jafar's ear and whispered, "Damn, where did you get that bozo?"
"Shh!" "" Jafar sylkäisi.
Lago didn't let anyone know that he could speak like a human—no one but his master, of course.
But right now, Jafar didn't want to listen.
He looked.
Watch and wait.
"Who is disturbing my dreams!" » the tiger god growled, his voice once again echoing across the land.
"Um...it's me, Gazeem, the lowly thief."
Her voice was a nervous cry and her knees were weak and shaking.
"Know this!" said the tiger god. "Only one person can get here.
The one whose rags hide a pure heart – A diamond in the rough! »
Gazeem cast a suspicious look behind him.
"Jack!" » ordered Jafar.
Frightened, Qazeem turned towards the opening of the cave.
A staircase led down to... what? He couldn't say that. Carefully he began to descend.
RRRRRAAAAAUUQQHHHHHH!
The Tiger God's thunderous roar was unlike anything Jafar had ever heard.
Gazeem's scream was only heard for a moment, then the tiger god's mouth snapped shut,
silences the thief forever.
"Find the diamond in the rough!" » ordered the tiger god.
Slowly the stone collapsed into a pile of sand.
The halves of the beetle flickered and then went dark.
Jafar watched silently as Lago dove to the hill and surfaced coughing up sand.
He picked up the beetle halves and returned to Jafar.
"I can not believe this!" Lago said. "We'll never get a chance to get our hands on that stupid lamp!"
"Patience, lago, patience. Gazeem apparently wasn't worth it."
"Now there's a big surprise!" » Lago said and rolled his eyes. "What are we going to do? We have a big
the problem here—”
But Jafar simply reached out and covered Lago's beak. He needed peace.
“Only one gets in…” he said. "I must find this, this diamond in the rough."
A diamond in the rough—Jafar understood what that meant.
An ordinary person, poor and dirty, who had great qualities.
There was only one way to find this person, and Jafar knew exactly how to do it.
A devilish smile spread across his face.
He hadn't gotten the treasure tonight, but that didn't matter.
He was close—oh so close.
And before long his wait would be over.
CHAPTER TWO
Stop, thief!"
The guard shouted at the top of his lungs as he chased the raggedly dressed boy through the crowd.
Agrabah market.
The boy deftly zigzagged around the outdoor stalls: fruit sellers, clothes sellers, bakers, curious people.
sellers.
In his right hand he held bread.
Beside him ran a little monkey dressed in a vest and hat.
I'll get you, street rat!” the guard yelled.
Street rat. If there was one name Aladdin hated, it was this one.
The Sultan's guards looked down upon the poor people of Agrabah, like him.
Of course he sometimes stole food.
He had no choice: he had to eat.
But he was no street rat.
"Come on Abu!" Aladdin called his pet monkey.
He ran to a nearby house and jumped onto a low, flat roof.
Then he and Abu ran from rooftop to rooftop.
lands on a clothesline and finally falls into a soft pile of clothes.
Instantly he grabbed the thick, hairy hands.
It was Rasoul, the head of the Sultan's guard.
Rasoul was a man of few words, but if there was one thing he did well, it was catching young thieves.
"I got you!" Rasoul said as he picked up Aladdin.
Abu jumped on Rasoul's shoulder and pulled the guard's turban over his eyes.
Aladdin quickly freed himself and he and Abu escaped.
They walked through the market, passing a camel seller, a rug seller, and a jewelry cart.
Suddenly Abou stopped.
The little monkey's eyes were fixed on the cart.
Abu had a great weakness: sparkling jewelry.
He crouched next to the cart and reached out to steal the pendant.
"Stop him!" » someone shouted.
Ten faces turned towards Abu.
Aladdin turned around. He grabbed Abu by his neck.
To their right, the guards charged closer.
To their left, the angry townspeople approached.
Aladdin and Abu ran straight ahead towards the staircase that led to the tall tower.
They ran up the stairs and through the window.
Aladdin grabbed the rug and using it as a parachute, he and Abu jumped from one window to another.
side of the building.
They jumped again, this time landing safely in a quiet little alley overshadowed by the Sultan's palace.
the palace gates.
There, the market's voices died down.
Aladdin exhaled and sat up. He was hungry.
"Alright Abu, now let's enjoy ourselves!" he said, breaking the bread in half.
But before he could eat, he saw a frail boy and girl in the shadows.
They said nothing, but their wide, staring eyes spoke for them.
Aladdin could tell they hadn't eaten in days.
He looked at the bread. He had risked his life to get it—and his mouth was watering like crazy. But he
I couldn't let them go hungry.
Sighing, he handed half to the children.
"Come on, take it," he said softly.
Abu frowned but handed him his coin as well. The girl is smiling.
She took Abu's bread and gently stroked his fur.
Abu liked it. People didn't usually treat him this kindly.
He lifted his hat and walked away proudly – ​​kicking Aladdin's legs straight.
But Aladdin didn't even notice it. His gaze was fixed on something straight ahead.
"Wow…" Aladdin muttered.
The market was quiet.
In the middle was a man on a horse. He was dressed in robes of the finest silk studded with jewels.
As people cleared the way and bowed, the man raised his chin proudly in the air.
Aladdin walked out of the alley towards the crowd. Everyone was whispering about rich people
mies.
"It is Prince Ahmed," said the woman, "on his way to the palace."
"Just one suitor for the princess," an old man said, shaking his head.
"He proposed and she kicks him out, like everyone else."
Aladdin looked at him in astonishment. If a princess could reject someone like that, she must be a pretty amazing girl!
Aladdin felt a tug on his leg. Abu pulled him towards the crowd. Aladdin saw a group of poor people
the children gather too close to Prince Ahmed's horse.
Suddenly the horse jumped, scaring the children, and the prince shouted, "Get out of my way, you dirty
children!"
Enraged, Aladdin burst through the crowd and stood up to Prince Ahmed.
"If I were as rich as you," he cried, "I could afford manners!"
"Get out of my way, you flea-bitten street rat!" Prince Ahmed kicked his horse and charged at Aladdin,
throw him in the mud.
Burning with anger, Aladdin jumped up and started running after the prince's horse.
"I'm worthless! I'm not a street rat!" He shouted.
He ran to the palace gates. With a loud voice,
they hit him in the face. "And I don't have fleas!" he yelled at the closed doors.
Prince Ahmed never even looked back. Aladdin bowed his head sadly and sauntered back into the city. Like
A freezing darkness settled over Agrabah that night, Aladdin and Abu climbed to the roof of an old ruined building.
building. There were only a few rugs and a few worn pillows, but for Aladdin and Abu, that was it
House. Abu curled up on the pillow and closed his eyes. Smiling, Aladdin covered her with a soft rug.
"One day, Abu, things will be different," he said. "We are clothed in cloaks instead of rags. And
we are in the palace looking out instead of looking out.”
In the distance the Sultan's palace stood majestically.
"That would be life, wouldn't it, Abu?" Being rich, living in a palace and never having any problems. »
Aladdin fell asleep with a sigh.
CHAPTER THREE
"Meeeooow!"
The cry came from the palace zoo. This echoed in the throne room where the sultan was ensconced
his ears.
Hit! The door slammed against the throne room wall and tripped
angry Prince Ahmed.
"I've never been so insulted!" he shouted.
"Good luck marrying him!"
"But... but..." stammered the Sultan.
The prince walked right next to her and exited through another door, revealing a large hole in the bottom of her pants.
"Jasmine!" » exclaimed the Sultan.
He was a boisterous, cheerful and kind old man, loved by his subjects. Only one person can get it
upset – his daughter.
Princess Jasmine. She loved him very much, but he was so... stubborn. He just wanted her to get married
prince. Every princess has done it.
But Jasmine? No, no one was good enough for him! He entered the palace zoo. Sound
water was everywhere, flowing in marble streams that poured into basins from hand-carved fountains.
It was the most beautiful place in all of Agrabah.
But the Sultan no longer noticed any of this. "Jasmine!" he called back.
"Rrrrrrr..." came a soft sigh.
There was a flash of orange and black. The Sultan came face to face with the teeth of a tiger
hanging from the missing part of Prince Ahmed's trousers.
"That's fucked up. Rajah!" said the Sultan, grasping the torn cloth.
The Rajah slipped to the bottom of the garden, where the Sultan's daughter was sitting on the edge of the fountain.
"Oh, papa, the Rajah was just playing," she said, petting the tiger gently. “You're just playing with it
You're overdressed and self-absorbed, Prince Ahmed, aren't you? » he said to the Rajah.
Jasmine was really beautiful. Princes from miles away risked their lives crossing the desert to see
his. Each vowed to conquer the world for their love.
But Jasmine was tired of idiot princes and boastful nobles. If only one
they would look a little
intelligence...a little kindness, honesty and a sense of humor wouldn't hurt either.
The Sultan shook his head. "Honey, you need to stop rejecting all suitors. The law says you have to be."
married to a prince before your next birthday. You only have three days left. »
"The law is wrong!" Jasmine replied.
"Dad, I hate being forced to get married. If I get married, I want it to be for love."
"It's not just the law," the Sultan said softly. He hesitated for a moment before continuing. "I'm not going
be here forever and I just want to make sure you are taken care of.
"But I've never done anything alone! I've never had a real one
friends except you. Rajah,” said Jasmine petting her tiger.
head. "I've never even left the palace walls!"
"But Jasmine, you're a princess!" exclaimed the Sultan.
"So maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore!"
"Oooooo!" The Sultan raised his hand and stepped back inside
The throne room.
A shadow appeared behind him. It was the long, thin shadow of a man
in pointed turban, parrot on shoulder. In his right hand
It was a long stick with a snake's head carved on the end.
The Sultan turned around.
"Ah Jafar, my most trusted advisor!" he said. "I desperately need your wisdom."
"My life is only to serve you," Jafar said tightly, with a thin-lipped smile.
"Jasmine refuses to choose a husband," said the Sultan. "I'm at the end of my rope!"
"Awk! It's over!" Lago shouted.
The Sultan reached into a porcelain bowl and pulled out some cookies. "Eat cookies. Pretty Polly?" he said.
If there was one thing Lago hated, it was eating cookies. Especially the dry and stale ones owned by the Sultan. He
practically mouthed as the sultan shoved crackers into his beak.
"Your majesty must have a problem with stupid animals," Jafar pointed out. “Now I might find
solution to your problem, but it would require using Blue Diamond.
The Sultan retreated. He pressed the ring on his finger. - My ring has been in the family ever since
years…” he protested.
Jafar held his staff before the Sultan's eyes. The snake head's eyes began to glow. “It is necessary
Find a suitor for the princess, right? » Jafar said as he stepped closer, "Don't worry... everything will be fine." »
The Sultan could not help but look at the snake's head. His will was running out.
"Everything will be fine," she smiled, taking the ring from her finger and giving it to Jafar.
Jafar smiled. "You are very kind, father," said Jafar. "Now run and play with your toys,
hmm"
"Yes…" the Sultan said, waddling dreamily.
Jafar turned and left the throne room. As he rushed down the marble corridor, Lago began to spit
cookies.
"I can't take it anymore! If I have to eat one more of those disgusting moldy cookies, I will

"Calm down, lago," Jafar said. “This blue diamond reveals to us a diamond in the rough

At the end of the corridor, Jafar entered his private quarters. “Soon he will be the Sultan, not this giant

"And then," Lago sang, "I shove some crackers down his throat!"
At the other end of the dark room, Jafar pushed open a secret door that revealed a spiral staircase. He
began to climb the stairs that led to his private laboratory. In every corner
Drinks bubble from the room in glass jugs. In the back was a huge cauldron and huge
an hourglass on an old table.
Jafar walked towards the hourglass holding the blue diamond. "Now, Lago, let's get to work."
Early the next morning. Jasmine crept up the palace wall. Rajah followed close behind him, his shoulders slumped
in grief.
"I'm sorry. Rajah," Jasmine said, "but I can't stay here and live my life for myself."
Tears welled up inside her. It was hard enough running away from his father. But we have to investigate

Then he disappeared overboard, into the land of his subjects—a

CHAPTER FOUR
Breakfast is served, Abu!” said Aladdin, opening a
ripe and juicy melon. On top of the awning, the two friends had a
a perfect view of the busy market below. All around them,
merchants advertised their products. "Buy a pot - brass and silver!" » called one.
“Sweet dates and figs!” shouted another as he walked through the crowd of people watching the fire eater.
"Pistachios! Leave the fire
fry them for you!”
"Fresh fish!" exclaimed a third salesman. Aladdin watched as the man waved the large fish high in the air, almost
slap him in the young person's face
a girl who was covered with a thin fur. He staggered back and crashed into the fire eater. He
belched a long stream of fire.
"I see!" exclaimed the young girl in astonishment. "I'm sorry!"
Aladdin stopped eating. All he could do was stare.
Maybe it was his eyes, so deep and kind. Or her hair, like a waterfall made of the blackest silk. Or her
perfect skin, or she...
Aladdin blushed. He never thought of girls that way. But this… well, this was different. Special
in any case. Aladdin looked at him
as he passed through the market. Jasmine noticed a small boy in tattered clothes standing confused outside
a
pile of ripe fruit. "You must be hungry," she said, grabbing an apple from the cart. "Here is."
The child beamed. He runs away grabbing the apple.
"You better pay for it!" said the salesman.
"Pay?" Jasmine looked confused. He had never paid anything
his life. “I'm sorry sir, I don't have the money, but I'm sure I'll get some
some from the Sultan…”
"Thief!" The salesman grabbed her hand. With the other hand he pulled
took out a shiny knife. “Do you know what the punishment is for theft?
Suddenly, Aladdin rushed between them and grabbed the salesman.
arm. "Thank you good sir, I'm so glad you found my sister!" he said.
Turning to Jasmine, she growled, "I've been looking everywhere for you!"
Jasmine
was about to protest when Aladdin whispered, "Play a game..."
The salesman took Aladdin aside and said to him, “Do you know this girl?
said he knew the sultan! »
"She's my sister," Aladdin replied. Then he lowered his voice and said:
"Unfortunately, he's a bit crazy. He thinks the monkey is the Sultan."
Quickly, Jasmine started bowing to Abu. “O wise Sultan,” he said.
"How may I serve you?"
People in the crowd started laughing. Aladdin helped Jasmine up and
He said, "Come now. Sister. It's time to go to the doctor."
While the vendor looked at Aladdin and Jasmine, Abu grabbed the apples.

Jasmine stopped in front of the camel and said, “Hey Doctor, how
Are you?"
"No, no, not that," said Aladdin. "Come on. Sister." He called
his shoulder: "Come. Sultan!"
Abu followed them. He blew out in imitation of his chest
the Sultan—and three apples fell from his coat.
The salesman blushed with rage. "Come back here, you little thieves!"
He was crying.
But it was too late. All three started running and
disappeared into the crowd.
In the palace, Jafar was laughing with evil glee, Lago was frantic

from the generator to the bubbling pot. Slowly shimmer
a blue cloud formed in the air.
The blue diamond was enclosed in a frame above the huge
Hourglass. Jafar put his hand in front of him and shouted, "Go, sand of time! Reveal to me the one who can
enter the cave!"
He turned the hourglass over. Then with a big bang! bolt
lightning flashes from the cloud. He hit the diamond which exploded
in pulsating blue light.
The sand in the hourglass began to glow and faint. Little by little the picture
began to form – the image of Aladdin runs through

“Is this the clown we've been waiting for?” Lago muttered.
"Yes, a little child in rags. How perfect, we'll never miss him!"
Jafar looked at Lago with a twisted smile. “Let the guards extend
an invitation to the palace, okay?
Aladdin, Abu and Jasmine jumped from roof to roof

from Agrabah earlier. But he had to admit one thing: when it came
jumping onto rooftops, he learned quickly.
When Aladdin and Abu finally arrived home. Jasmine looked
and I said, "Do you live here?"
"Yes, just me and Abu," Aladdin replied. “It's not much, but it's there

what it would be like to live there and have servants and servants…”
Jasmine sighed. “And the people who tell you where to go and how

"It's better than here," Aladdin replied. "Always looking for food

"Never be free to make your own choices," Jasmine said. "Always

"Trapped," they said at the same time. Their eyes met and they

"What does it matter?" Jasmine replied. "Iran
far away and I'm not coming back. My father forces me to take it
married".
"It's terrible!" said Aladdin.
Jasmine's eyes met his again. Suddenly Aladdin could no longer speak,
I couldn't even move. Strange feelings ran through him,
feelings so strong they made him dizzy.
Who was this mysterious girl?
Aladdin heard Abu chatting wildly, but he didn't listen. All that he
He saw, all he heard was Jasmine.
"There you are!" » shouted a voice.
Aladdin emerged from his trance. Below them stood a crowd
the Sultan's guards, swords drawn.
"They're after me!" Aladdin and Jasmine said together. They
stopped looking at each other in confusion and then spoke again
at the same time, "Do they share you?"
But we didn't have time to figure things out. Aladdin looked
on the opposite side of the roof. Below was a pile of hay. "Trust yourself
me?" he asked Jasmine pulling her closer. Their eyes met again.
"Well... yes," he replied.
"Then jump!"
Aladdin, Jasmine and Abu jumped from the roof. They
landed safely in the hay and quickly got back up. Aladdin turned
around, ready to sprint for his life.
But it was too late. Rasoul towered over him, smiling. “We just like
cross paths, huh, street rat? This is a dungeon for you,
son!"
Jasmine stood in Rasoul's way. "Let him go!"
"Look, street mouse!" Rasoul grunted. He pushed, laughing
Jasmine in the ground.
Jasmine jumped up. Anger flashed in his eyes. Royally
taking off his hood, he said in a firm and authoritative voice:
"Let him go, by the princess's orders!"
"Princess?" repeated Aladdin.
The guards froze in shock. "Princess Jasmine?" said Rasoul. "What-
what are you doing outside the palace
"Do as I say," Jasmine said. "Let him go."
“I would, princess,” replied Rasoul, “unless my orders come from there

And he dragged Aladdin away with a shrug.
"Trust me, I'm coming!" Jasmine exclaimed.

"Princess," he said, "how may I serve you?"
Princess Jasmine looked into his eyes. “Jafar, the guards

I tried to kidnap you."
"He didn't kidnap me!" Jasmine replied. "I ran away!"
Jafar's brow furrowed in concern. "Oh my god, how shocking. If I had known…" His voice
was dragged out.
"What do you mean?" » asked Jasmine.
"Unfortunately, the boy's sentence has already been carried out."
Jasmine shivered. “What sentence?
Jafar sighed. She put her hand on Jasmine's shoulder. "Dead," Jafar
said softly. "Putting the head down."
Jasmine's breath caught in her throat. "How... how could you?"
He turned and ran out the door, stopping only when he reached the door

And now he was dead. Because of a stupid mistake.
“Oh Rajah,” he said. "This is all my fault. I didn't even know him
too much."
Jasmine buried her head in Rajah's Turk and cried.
CHAPTER FIVE
The palace dungeon was cold, dark and dirty. Not even
the sultan had already come there. All the prisoners were brought there
Jafar—and not one had escaped.
Aladdin decided to be the first. He grunted loudly, struggled
to his chains, but they caught on the stone wall.
Jafar had lied to Jasmine. Aladdin was alive, but not for long
everything went according to Jafar's plan.
Aladdin fell to the ground with a groan. "She was a princess," he said
said to himself. "I can not believe it !"
At that moment, a shadow appeared on the wall: the shadow of a little one
a monkey between the bars of a prison window. "Abou!"
Aladdin yelled and turned around. "Here!"
Abu came down. He frowned at Aladdin and chattered angrily
he imitated a pretty girl walking.
Aladdin knew that he too was being reprimanded for paying
a lot of attention to Jasmine. “Hey, he was in trouble,” he said, “I'll go
However, I will never see him again. I'm a street rat, remember! In addition,

But Aladdin fell to the ground. He was still thinking

"You're just a fool if you give in," said a booming voice.
Aladdin turned to see an old man with crooked teeth limping out of the room.

"Who are you!" » asked Aladdin.
“I'm a humble prisoner like you, but together we might be
more. I know a cave full of treasure beyond your wildest
dreams." The man came closer smiling. "Treasures are enough
to impress your princess I guess.
Abu's eyes lit up at the mention of the treasure. He shot Aladdin

None of them saw Lago come out of the old man's hump and
whispers, "Jafar, can you hurry! I'm dying from this!
Aladdin looked at the prisoner in despair. “But the law says he has to

Jafar interrupted Aladdin. He raised a bony finger and spoke again
in an old man's voice. "You have heard of the Golden Rule! He who
Honey makes the rules!"
"Why would you share this treasure with me?" » asked Aladdin.
"I need young legs and a strong back." Jafar
walked up to the dungeon wall and pushed one of the rocks. Slowly one
an entire section of wall opened up, revealing a hidden staircase. "We too
Do you have a contract?"
Aladdin hesitated, but shook the old man's hand.
Jafar laughed excitedly. "They were out!"
It was dark when they reached the Cave of Wonders. Jafar took
Remove the pieces of the beetle and reassemble them.
Aladdin watched in amazement as the pieces flew into the sandstone and
a huge tiger god appears.
"Who disturbs my sleep?" a scary voice was heard. Jafar
beckoned Aladdin to come closer.
Abu jumped into Aladdin's vest. Aladdin tried to avoid himself

A tunnel of harsh light erupted from the Tiger God's mouth. Aladdin had

“Quick, my son,” Jafar urged in his old man's voice, “go get it

Carefully, Aladdin stepped into the tiger god's mouth. Through
In the blinding light he saw a long flight of stairs leading down. at
there were mountains of gold below. Golden waterfalls. loose change,

can see.
Abu was practically hypnotized by the sight of all this gold and left
straight ahead to a huge treasure chest.
"Abou!" Aladdin warned. "Don't touch anything! We have to find this
a lamp."
Abu grumbled but turned away from the chest and followed his master through the cave until he heard a noise.
strange
movement behind him. He turned to look.
Nothing, just a purple carpet with golden pompoms on the floor.
Abu turned and ran towards Aladdin.
This time something hit Abu's shoulder and then tore his
hat. Abu turned again.
It was a carpet that walked behind him.
"Eeeeeeeee!" » Abu shouted and jumped on top of Aladdin for cover.
Frightened, the carpet quickly ran behind a large pile of coins.
"Stop it, Abu!" » said Aladdin.
» Abu chatted and pointed to a large mound. Aladdin turned and
I saw the pom pom stick out and then quickly push back in.
Aladdin moved closer to see better. He saw the carpet

"Come out, we won't hurt you."
Using its lower two bombs as legs and upper arms
Matto slowly emerged and handed Aladdin Abu's hat. that Aladdin
mouth open in disbelief.
Abu grabbed the hat and started scolding the carpet.
The rug slowly moved away and hung in shame. “Hey, wait a minute
wait, don't go!" said Aladdin. "Maybe you can help us find this
a lamp...."
Matto turned around and started pointing excitedly. Aladdin
smiling. "I think he knows where it is!"
The carpet that rose from the ground began to fly. Aladdin and Abu
I followed him to another cave.
Aladdin stopped abruptly. This cave made another appear
like a waiting room. It reached so high that Aladdin could not see

seen in the wilderness. Aqua blue lagoon water extends from the wall
to the wall.
In the middle of the lake stood a tower made of solid rock with only a set
stepping stones leading to it. At the top, illuminated by a magical ray of light,
was a small object.
It was too far away to see, but Aladdin knew it must be a lamp.
His heart began to pound. It wouldn't be easy to get to the top. First he
he would have to skip stones, then he would have to
climb a steep and jagged rock tower.
"Wait here," he said to Abu and the carpet. “And remember, don't
touch anything. »
Aladdin jumped from stone to stone and arrived at the foot of the stone
tower. With a sudden sigh, the sloping rock turned into a
stairs.
Aladdin smiled. Someone—something—was by his side. He ran
upwards, two steps at a time.
In the upper part, the lamp was clearly visible.
It was dusty and dented and looked cheaper than the worst used one
lamp he had ever seen in the market.
Aladdin got it back. "That's it?" he said to himself. “That's who we are
Did you come all the way here?"
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Abu and the carpet. They
were in front of a large golden statue that looked like a gigantic monkey
idol. His hands were outstretched, and in his palms he held a
a huge red gem.
And Abu reached out to make it happen.
"Abou!" Aladdin shouted. "No!"
But it was too late. Abu had a jewel in his hands.
The ground immediately began to rumble. Stones and dust fell
above. The voice of the tiger god rang out like a cannon: “Unbelievers! YOU
have touched the forbidden treasures! Now you'll never see again
daylight!"
The gem began to melt in Abu's hand. Panicking, he put it back in
the palms of the statue.
But the damage was already done. The staircase below Aladdin
turned into a long gutter, and his legs gave out.
With a last-minute leap, Aladdin grabbed the lamp. Collapse
From the slide, he saw the lagoon turn into a boiling pool of lava. He has closed
his eyes preparing for the end.
Wow! He stopped mid-flight. Something pushed him upwards.
His eyes suddenly opened.
The mat had caught him, and he won!
The cave shook violently. Aladdin held tight to the carpet. He
dodging left and right as large rocks fell from the ceiling. Aladdin
looked down and looked for Abu.
"Eeeeeee!" came a cry from below. There he jumped across the road
springboards and screams. A stone rushed over his head
towards him.
With the acceleration, the carpet collapsed. The plucked Aladdin
Abu moved out of harm's way and then flew towards the entrance of the cave. THE

piles of dazzling treasures caught fire. Aladdin and Abu watched
in terror. Coins and jewelry melt!
The carpet ran up the stairs charred by the lava wave. They

THANK YOU! A jagged piece of stone fell onto the carpet and stuck it to the floor.

Aladdin and Abu fell down the stairs.
Aladdin looked at the carpet in dismay. There was no way he could
could save him. Saving yourself would be hard enough.
He looked up. He saw an opening at the top: freedom. Abu
I climbed the stairs and jumped out.
Aladdin followed as fast as he could, but the stairs began to shake.
He lost his footing.
He jumped up and rushed to the top step. His fingers gripped
on top of it—just as the entire staircase buckled beneath him.
Aladdin hovered above the collapsing cave. "Help me!" he cries. "I
I can not take it!"
Jafar, still dressed as a beggar, peered over the edge. “Give me first
a lamp!"
There was no time to argue. Aladdin liked it.
Jafar's eyes glowed as he grabbed the lamp and thrust it into his own
bathrobe. "Finally!" » he shouted triumphantly. Looking at Aladdin, he pulled

"What are you doing?" Aladdin cried.
"I'll give you your reward!" Jafar replied. "Your eternal reward."
Abu jumped at Jafar and bit him hard on the arm.
"Yeahgggggh!" Jafar shouted. He fought hard, but Abu held on.
Finally, Jafar dropped the dagger. With a furious gesture he threw
Abu in the cave.
Aladdin's fingers couldn't take it anymore. He let go.
The walls of the cave rushed past him as he and Abu fell headlong.
high heels.
CHAPTER Six
Aladdin woke up on the cave floor. The fire was out, the lava was gone, only the constant trickle of water echoed.
throughout the cave.
Above him were the mat and Abu.
Aladdin sighed and sat up. The carpet dropped and Abu began
stir. Above him, Aladdin saw no openings, only a solid ceiling.

"We're trapped," he said. "That two-faced jackal boy! He's tall

Abou jumped up. Something bulges in his coat: a jewel, Aladdin
figuratively. Like a magician, Abu waved his hands, reached for his coat,
and took out the hidden object.
Aladdin blinked and shook his head. It was a lamp!
"Well, little thief," Aladdin said with a smile. He took the broken lamp and examined it carefully.
"It has something written on it,
but it's hard to understand.
Aladdin rubbed the faded words on his sleeve. He
it was almost impossible to remove the dirt. He rubbed harder and
louder, then stopped abruptly.
The lamp shone!
Aladdin sighed. Abu and the mat moved back.
So...lol! Colorful smoke comes out of the lamp's nozzle. He

shape - huge flowing shape with arms, chest, head and a
a crazy-eyed face with a long, black, curly beard.
"Ten thousand years will give you such a sore neck!" blue
said the creature.
Aladdin and Abu watched as he grabbed the head and
I turned it around. "Wow, Does it feel good!" he said.
"Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hello! What's your name?"
"Öh... Aladdin."
"Hey, Aladdin! Can I call you Ali? Or maybe just Din. Or what

Eyes open, Aladdin turned towards the carpet. “I had to hit mine

The creature has returned to its original form. “Say, you are a lot
smaller than my last champion!” he said.
"Wait a minute," Aladdin said. "Am I your master?"
'Properly! And I am your spirit, straight from the lamp! Here
to make your wishes come true! Three wishes to be exact – and ixnay
I hope for even more wishes! Three, that's it! No exchanges,

"Three wishes?" Aladdin said. "Do I want three?"
"Uh, almost," the spirit replied. "There are some limits. A rule
number one: I can't kill anyone, so don't ask. Rule Number Two: I
I can't make anyone fall in love with another. Rule number three
- I can't bring people back to life. In addition to that, you have

Aladdin loved this genie. He decided to tease her a little.
"Bounds?" He sighed. "Almighty Genius. I don't know,
Abu, he probably won't even get us out of this cave. »
Genie put her hands on her hips. "Excuse me? You don't believe it
me?” He jumped onto the carpet and took Aladdin and Abu into his
mammoth hands. “You get your wish, so sit back and we
out of here!"
He lowered them and then raised his arms above his head. Thunder
above them there was a boom and an explosion
open to the ceiling of the cave. The rocks and sand crumbled, and early
morning light flooded in.
The carpet started to rise. He climbed up and increased his speed.
Aladdin stood firm as the genie stepped back and laughed at it
makes the walls shake.
Aladdin couldn't help but laugh to himself. Desert air never
it smelled so good.
He was free.
And he still had three wishes left.

with me...before their heads are beheaded!"
Princess Jasmine smiled at Jafar as he lowered his head. His
shoulder, even Lago looked bad. “My humblest apologies to both of you
you,” Jafar said.
"At least it'll be something good if I'm forced into marriage," Jasmine
said. “Being queen, I have the power to get rid of it
you, Jafar!” With that, he headed towards the zoo.
"Jasmine!" » shouted the Sultan and ran after him.
Jafar saw them leave. His sad and pained look started
disappear. All his rage and frustration boiled over. “If only I had
I got this lamp,” he grumbled through gritted teeth.
“Saying we have to keep kissing this idiot and his idiot

"Until she found a stupid husband," Jafar pointed out. “So he goes

"Wait a minute, Jafar!" Lago said. "What if you married a princess?"
So you're going to be the Sultan, right? »
Jafar slowly walked over to the throne and sat down. It was awesome !
"Hmmm," he said. "There is merit in the idea"
"Yeah!" Lago shouted. “And then we leave the half - the father and the little one
woman from the top of the cliff - ker-splat! »
Jafar burst out laughing. "I love the way your dirty little mind works!"
In a desert oasis just outside Agrabah, the carpet fell
sand. Genie turned to Aladdin with a proud smile. “Well how
about that or what? Are you doubting me now? »
"No," said Aladdin. "Well, of my three wishes..."
"Three?" said the spirit. "You cut one, son!" »
Aladdin smiled mischievously. “I never really wanted to get out
Cave. You did it alone!"
Nero thought for a moment. "Very good," he said with a laugh.
'You win. But no more presents!"
Aladdin jumped off the carpet and started walking. "Hmm...
three wishes... What would you wish for?
"Me? No one's ever asked me that before." Nero thinks about it
for a while. "Well, in my case... freedom."
"You mean you're a prisoner?" » asked Aladdin.
"That's what being in genius is." Genie shrugged.
"Phenomenal cosmic forces, small living space."
Matto, Abu and Aladdin looked inside the small lamp. "Genius,
It's terrible, Aladdin said.
“To be free, to be my own master, that would be more than anything else

The only way I can get out is if my master wants me out, so you can
guess how many times this happened.
Aladdin thought for a moment. "I'll do it," he finally said.
"I will set you free."
"Yeah, yeah," the spirit said, rolling its eyes.
"No, I'm not lying," said Aladdin. “I promise you after that
my first two wishes, I use my third wish to free you.
"Okay, I hope so!" said the spirit. "What do you want now?"
"Well," said Aladdin, "there's this girl . . ."
"Wrong! I can't make anyone fall in love, remember?"
"But Genie, she's smart and funny and beautiful."
Aladdin shrugged and looked at the ground. “But she's a princess.
To even have a chance, I would have to be…”
That was it! The answer was right in front of him! "Hey!" Aladdin
said. "Can you make me a… prince?"
Genie raised an eyebrow. "Is this an official wish? Say magic
sanat "
"Genius, I wish you would make me a prince!" Aladdin exclaimed.
"Clear!" Genie began to circle Aladdin. "Now first us
we need to get rid of the Fez and waistcoat combo. » With a broad gesture,
he created a fine silk garment and a turban with dazzling jewels
and shiny gold trim. "Ooh, I like it!"
"Wow!" Aladdin couldn't believe how... princely he looked. No
we would dare to call him a "street rat" now. He raised the lamp and
he hid it under his turban. No honest prince would dare to be seen
such rubbish.
"Hmmm, you need a ride…" Genie looked
Abu. "Oh, sorry! Monkey boy!"
Abu runs away trying to hide. But it was useless. With a hand clap
fingers, the spirit turned him into a camel. “Hmmm…not good
That's enough," said the spirit, snapping his fingers again. Abu this time
appeared as
a wonderful stallion. "Still not enough" With a
decisive, Abu changed again, this time to a
elephant. "What better way to hit the streets
From Agrabah is like riding your own elephant! Let's talk about the frame

All Aladdin could do was stare in astonishment. Genie was on
roller. He was gesticulating wildly, laughing out loud. "Wait
to your turban, boy!" he cried. "We'll make you a star!'
CHAPTER EIGHT
Jafar rushed into the throne room with a large scroll in hand. "Father,"
he called the Sultan: “I have found a solution to the problem
with your daughter!"
"Awk! » » screamed Lago. "Trouble with your daughter!”
"It's here." Jafar opened the parchment and began to read, “If such
the princess did not choose a husband until her sixteenth birthday
the sultan chooses for him! »
The Sultan nodded. "But Jasmine hated all these suitors. How can I
choose someone he might hate?
"Don't worry, there's more," Jafar said as he rolled the parchment forward.
"If you can't find a suitable prince, you can be a princess
we got married..." Hmmm, interesting..."
"What?" » asked the Sultan. "WHO?"
"The royal vizier. Jafar looked up. "Well, it's me!”
"But I thought by law only a prince could marry a princess."
said the Sultan, grasping the parchment
Jafar quickly placed it on the table and picked up his wand. “Desperate
Times call for desperate measures, sir.
The snake's head began to glow with a hypnotic light. "Yes," the Sultan
he said with wide eyes. "Desperate times..."
"You command the princess to marry me," Jafar said confidently.
"I command the princess..."
Ra-ta'ta'taaaaaah! The sound of trumpets echoed through
window. The Sultan blinked and turned towards the noise. "What-
What! I heard something!"
Instantly the spell was broken. The Sultan rushed to the window and
Looked out. Humming, Jafar followed.
A huge crowd marched down the main street. A giant peacock
the float moved slowly behind; lions and bears in colorfully painted cages
rolled by. People filled the streets to see the grand procession
approaches.
"Make way for Prince Ali Ababwa!" sang the conductor. Behind him
walked a majestic elephant, its trunk proudly in the air. His
back, the glass roof bounced up and down.
From the canopy, Aladdin smiled and waved. The crowd roared
admiringly. Dancers swirled around him, swordsmen walked
in perfect harmony, with dozens of servants walking alongside them. Abu
proudly, and the carpet was the perfect pillow

Genie floated through the crowd, changing at regular intervals.

disguised, he told everyone how magnificent the prince was approaching.
When Aladdin arrived at the palace gates, he was already the talk of the town.
Agrabah. All around him: Abu, swordsmen, fanfare,
the dancers and everyone else walked straight into the throne room.
As the Sultan and Jafar stared, Aladdin slid off and onto Abu's back
carpet. "Your Majesty," said Aladdin, bowing
Sultan: "I have come from afar to seek your daughter's hand."
"Prince Ali Ababwa!" said the Sultan with a bright smile. "I am
nice to meet you. This is my royal vizier, Jafar. »
Jafar didn't look happy at all. "I'm afraid. Prince Abooboo..."
"Ababwa," Aladdin corrected him.
"Whatever," Jafar said. “You can't just parade around here without an invitation
Ja-"
"What a remarkable device!" exclaimed the Sultan, looking at him
carpet. "Can I try?"
"Well, sure. Your Majesty!" Aladdin said. He helped the Sultan
on the carpet. He took off and sent the Sultan flying across the room.
As the old man screamed with joy, Jafar looked at Aladdin warily.
"Just where did you say you were from?"
Before Aladdin could answer, the carpet fell and left him
the sultan leaves. “Well, he is a very impressive young man and a prince,
Besides!" The Sultan said to Jafar, lowering his voice, "If we're lucky,
you don't have to marry Jasmine! »
"I don't trust him…" Jafar said.
The Sultan ignored him. "That's absurd, Jafar. Jasmine will like this."
"And I'm sure I'll love Princess Jasmine," said Aladdin.
"Your Highness!" Jafar exclaimed. "On behalf of Jasmin, I have to say…"
"Let him meet me," Aladdin interrupted. “I will beat you
girl."
None of them had seen Jasmine come out of the zoo
Rajah behind him. "How dare you!" he says. "Standing,
to decide my future. I am not a prize to be won! » Because he
turned around and rushed out.
Aladdin's heart raced. He was sure she would love him as a prince. He
I never thought this would happen.
"Don't worry. Prince Ali," said the Sultan. “Give him time to calm down
down. It warms you up.”
Aladdin and the Sultan entered the zoo. Jafar looked
quietly and then turned to Lago. “I think it's time to say goodbye
Prince Aboubou…”
CHAPTER 9
For the rest of the day, Aladdin waited in the room

come to his balcony.
As night fell, Aladdin began to lose hope. “What am I doing
do?" he sighed. "I should have known I couldn't handle this stupidity
a princely act."
Abu looked at his master and waved his trunk in sympathy.
"Very good," said the spirit, looking up from the chess game
carpet. "Here's the deal. If you want to date her, you have to tell her
truth. Be yourself!"
"Not at all!" Aladdin said. “If Jasmine found out I really am someone
dirty street rat, he makes fun of me. » He looked up into Jasmine's eyes.
to the balcony and stood up. "I'm going to go see him," he said.
said. "I need to be smooth. Cool. Confident."
Genie sighed. He knew Aladdin would be in trouble.
The carpet slid under Aladdin and lifted him onto Jasmine's balcony.
From his window, Aladdin saw her playing with Rajah.
"Princess Jasmine?" he called.
Jasmine turned and walked towards the window. "Who's here?"
"It is I," said Aladdin. Then he remembers the voice of Prince Alina
added: "Prince Ali Ababwa".
"I do not want to see you!" » Jasmine spat.
When he returned to the room, Aladdin rose from the rug and
on the balcony. "Please, princess, give me a chance!"
Rajah threw himself in his way. Aladdin nodded away and almost lost his
turban.
Jasmine narrowed her eyes. "Wait. Do I know you? You remind me of you
from someone I met at the market.
Aladdin retreated into the shadows. 'Toria? Why, I have
servants who go to the market for me! So it couldn't be
the me you met."
"No, I guess not," Jasmine said looking disappointed.
A bee buzzed in Aladdin's ear. He moved to smash it until he heard it
speak with the voice of a genius! "Enough of you," he said. 'Speak
his."
"Princess Jasmine, you are…uh, beautiful." Aladdin said.
"Rich too," he said. "And the Sultan's daughter."
Aladdin smiled. "I know."
"A fine prize for any prince," he said, playing along.
"Good! A prince like me!"
"Good! A prince like you!" Jasmine repeated. "And everyone else
a fluttering peacock I met. Jump off the balcony!"
Jasmine turned and walked into her room.
"First of May!" First of May! » said the spirit still disguised as a bee. “Stop him!
Do you want me to poke him?"
"Go away!" Aladdin replied.
"Okay," said the spirit. "But remember: be yourself!"
"Yeah, it is," Aladdin muttered as the spirit flew under his turban.
and in the lamp.
Jasmine looked over her shoulder. "What?"
"Um...I said, you're right!" Aladdin sighed. “You… are not just a few
prizes to be won. You should be free to make your own choices. »
Dejected, Aladdin turned away. He climbed over the railing and
came down from the balcony into space.
"No!" Jasmine cried. But Aladdin didn't fall: he floated
outside.
"How do you do this?" Jasmine said in surprise.
"It's a magic carpet," Aladdin said.
Jasmine looked over the railing and touched the carpet. "It is lovely."
"You don't want a ride...do you?" Aladdin gave him a
a hopeful expression. "We can fly away and see the world..."
"Is it safe?" » asked Jasmine.
"Of course." Aladdin held out his hand and smiled. "Do you trust me?"
Do you trust me? Jasmine had heard those exact words before, she said
in the same way. "Yes," she said softly, taking his hand.
He stepped on the mat and it took off. Losing his balance, he
fell into Aladdin's arms. She blushed, but she liked the feeling—and he
I could tell Jasmine did too.
The carpet floated above the palace. Agrabah expanded below
them, a group of twinkling lights. And over
the stars of the desert sky twinkled a thousand times with them

Aladdin and Jasmine screamed in the middle of the pyramids

reached out and grabbed the apple for the princess.
She tossed it to him with a smile. A relaxed turn, a smile;
Do you trust me? - all this sounded exactly like a boy
walk. Was it possible?
He decided to find out. Finally, the carpet spread them to the ceiling
from the great pagoda, and they watched the fireworks from afar.
"Everything is so… magical," Jasmine said. “It's a shame Abu had to miss out
This."
"No," said Aladdin. "He hates fireworks. He really doesn't like flying

Aladdin caught himself mid-sentence.
"It is you!" exclaimed Jasmine. "Why did you lie to me! Did you think I
wouldn't you understand? »
"No! I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't—that's not what I meant—"
Aladdin searched for words. Her stomach turned. He couldn't give

Jasmine looked unsure. "Why didn't you tell me?"
“Well, you know… the royals come to town in disguise… it looks like a
a bit strange, isn't it? »
Perfect! He knew he had it now. After all, he was in disguise
when he met her.
"Not so weird," he said, resting his chin on Aladdin's shoulder.
Together they watched the fireworks until they were too tired to continue.
their eyes open. Then the carpet took them back to the palace,
hovering outside Jasmine's window.
Jasmine went to the balcony and then turned to Aladdin. They
smiled at each other over the railing - until the carpet gave Aladdin a
push forward a little.
His lips suddenly met hers. He didn't move at all. In soft light
stars, they shared a long kiss.
"Goodnight, handsome prince," she said, leaning back against him.

"Sleep well, princess," Aladdin replied.
When he disappeared behind the curtain, Aladdin

the carpet floated into the garden, "it's starting to look good".
He was brought back to reality when he felt the harsh grip of rough hands.

Before Aladdin could move, another guard handcuffed him.

"Abou!" Aladdin tried to scream through the nozzle. "Abou, help!"
He looked around wildly until he saw Abu hanging from the tree,
tied with a thick rope. The carpet tried to fly away, but another one
the guard threw him into the cage.
Jafar stepped out of the shadows. Lago smiled over his shoulder.
"I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo," Jafar
sihisi.
Aladdin turned around. He struggled with his chains. If only he
could reach his turban. The lamp was below and the spirit
was inside the lamp.
Jafar calmly looked at the guards. "Make sure he's never found."
CHAPTER TEN
In the cool of the desert night, the guards rushed towards Aladdin

Aladdin dove into the water with a loud noise. In the shade
In the moonlight she could see his turban fluttering in the distance. The lamp slowly
emerged and then fell to the bottom of the sea.
He kicked his legs desperately to reach the lamp. He fumbled with his
hands... There he was. But his strength left him. He tried

Splash! Genie materialized, wearing a shower cap and holding a
Scouring brush. "Never fail," he said. “You go in the bath and there is a

His smile instantly disappeared. Aladdin was limp.
"Al! Boy! Get out of there!" » asked the genie as he grabbed Aladdin. "I

I have to say, "Genius, I want you to save my life!" " I got it?''
Aladdin's head tilted slightly.
"I like it!" The Genie let go of Aladdin and swam a
circle. A whirlwind was created, spinning Aladdin upwards.
He broke the surface coughing and struggling. Before he can

that!” growled the spirit.
Aladdin looked around excitedly. He was alive, wet and
humiliated but alive. When they returned to Agrabah, Aladdin
looked at the smiling face of his savior.
"Genius, I...thank you" was all he could say.
Jasmine had never been happier. He couldn't stop humming and
he couldn't stop thinking about Aladdin.
Kun hän avasi hiuksensa makuuhuoneen peilin edessä, hän ei huomannut
hänen isänsä tulee sisään, Jafar hänen takanaan. "Jasmin...", sulttaani
alkoi.
Hän kääntyi ympäri. "Voi isä! Minulla on juuri ollut mitä mahtavinta aikaa.
Olen niin iloinen!"
Sulttaani katsoi suoraan eteenpäin. "Sinun pitäisi olla, Jasmine", hän sanoi hiljaisella äänellä. "Valitsin a

Menet naimisiin Jafarin kanssa. »
Jasmine huokaisi.
Jafar astui eteenpäin. Sauvansa käärmeen pää loisti kirkkaasti,
kohdistaa hypnoottisen loitsunsa sulttaaniin.
"Ei koskaan!" Jasmine sanoi. "Isä, valitsen prinssi Alin!"
Jafar nauraa. "Prinssi Ali on poissa, kuten kaikki muutkin. Mutta älä huoli.
Minne tahansa hän menikin, olen varma, että hän aiheutti sensaation. »
"Tarkista kristallipallosi, Jafar!" » kuului ääni
ikkuna.
Jafar kääntyi, Lago huusi hämmästyneenä. Se oli Aladdin!
Jasmine juoksi häntä kohti. "Prinssi Ali!" Hän itki. "Onko sinulla hyvin?"
"Kyllä", sanoi Aladdin, "mutta ei kiitos Jafarille. Hän yritti saada minut
tappaa!"
"Teidän korkeutenne", Jafar sanoi, "hän selvästi valehtelee."
"Ilmeisesti... valehtelee...", sulttaani toisti mekaanisesti.
"Isä, mikä sinua vaivaa?" » Jasmine sanoi tyrmistyneenä.
Aladdin walked across the room towards Jafar. “I know
What's wrong?” He grabbed Jafar's staff and broke it
snake's head on the ground.
"Oh! Oh my God..." said the Sultan, shaking his head. "I feel so weird."
"Your highness," Aladdin said, holding up the broken wand.
"Jafar rules you with this!"
The Sultan's eyes narrow. “Jafarl You traitor! Guards! Arrest
Jafar now!”
But Jafar had noticed something he hadn't noticed before:
A magic lamp came out of Aladdin's turban! He rushed towards
but the Sultan's guards seized it.
"It's not over yet, son!" Jafar said. She reaches for her dress
took the magic pellet and threw it on the ground. in a cloud of smoke,
He and Lago were gone.
"Find it!" » shouted the Sultan to his guards. "I can't believe it! Jafar,
My trusted advisor, plotting against me! »
His shocked expression turned into a smile as he turned
Jasmine and Aladdin. "Is it possible? My daughter finally chose one

Jasmine nodded and the Sultan wrapped his arms around Aladdin.
"Oh, you're a great boy! You're married
immediately! You will be happy, prosperous - and then you, my son, will be

Sultan I Aladdin swallowed nervously. It should have been
the happiest moment of his life, but he was suddenly very worried.
Lago flew over Jafar's lab in blind panic. “We need to get out
here!" he said. "I've got to pack my bags!”
But Jafar was deep in thought. He suddenly burst out laughing and
he grabbed Lago by the throat. “Prince All is nothing but that
Aladdin, the kid in rags! " he said. "He has a lamp, lago!"
Lago's eyes narrow. "Well, this little trickster..."
"But you can get away with it!" » Jafar said with a dark smile.
"Listen carefully."
Lago bowed as Jafar muttered his master plan.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Aladdin was given the most comfortable suite in the palace, but he
I barely slept that night. At dawn he walked to and fro,
holding turban, lamp inside. Abu and the mat were sitting outside
looking at him worriedly from the window.
"Huzz!" » exclaimed the genie as he stepped out of the lamp. “Aladdin, you have
just won the heart of a princess! What are you going to do next?''
He lowered his voice to a whisper. "Psst. Your next line is, "I'm going

"Genie," said Aladdin sadly, "I'm sorry, but I can't. They want to

The reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you! And if
will they find the truth? What if Jasmine found out? He's going to hate me."
Aladdin looked at Genie's pale and disappointed face. “Genius, me
I need you. Without you I'm just Aladdin."
Genie tried to hold back his anger. "I understand.
After all, you lied to everyone. Hey, I started to feel
outside. Now if you'll excuse me…”
With that, he disappeared into the lamp.
"Genie," Aladdin cried, "I'm so sorry."
Genie's lips protruded from the beak and shaved it.
"GOOD!" » snapped Aladdin, throwing a pillow at the lamp. 'Just like that
stay there!” As he walked away, he saw Abu and the carpet
looking at him from the window. "What are you watching?"
As Abu and the mat turned away. Jasmine's voice was heard

"I'm coming, Jasmine!" Aladdin shouted out the window.
He rushed out. As he ran towards the zoo
Through Jasmine's voice, he met a group of flamingos in a pond.
At least they all looked like flamingos.
Lago chuckled inwardly. Her Jasmine travel had worked—and
his flamingo mask was perfect thanks to Jafar's magic. When
Aladdin was gone, he rushed into the empty room and quickly flew away
a lamp. Hooked on its beak, it flew out and came right back
In Jafar's lab.
"AH! There you are." » said Jasmine. “I looked everywhere

Aladdin turned in confusion. Abu and the mat rushed towards

"Hurry up," she said, taking his hand. “Dad is doing
announcement of marriage."
They climbed the steps of the tower that overlooked the courtyard.
The townspeople blocked every square inch in a desperate attempt to see
the royal couple. Jasmine climbed onto the stage and took her seat
next to his father. Smiling, the Sultan announced to the audience:
“Ladies and gentlemen, my daughter has chosen a suitor: Prince Ali
You guys!”
LOCK DOUBLE TOTO
In another tower overlooking the palace
in the courtyard, Jafar and Lago watched as Aladdin prepared for it
in front of a screaming crowd.
"Look how they're cheering that little whiner!" exclaimed Lago.
"Let them clap," said Jafar, holding the lamp tightly and starting

A spirit appeared within the cloud of smoke. “Al, if you want
Sorry, I…” Genie's jaw dropped when he saw Jafar.
"I am your master now!" Jafar said.
"I was afraid of it..."
"Be quiet!" Jafar snapped. “And now, slave, give me the first
wish. I want to be the Sultan! »
As Aladdin watched from the platform, the crowd
became foggy. Clouds swirled above the palace and with great heartache

arrested, the Sultan was on the ground – in his underwear! The crowd
sighed.
There was someone else on the stand now – someone tall, dark and
dressed in the robes of a sultan. He held a serpent staff in his right hand.
"Jafar!" Aladdin exclaimed.
Jafar turned with a smile. "Sultan Jafar to you!"
"What kind of scam is this?" » asked the Sultan.
"The finder's guards," Jafar said. "I now have ultimate power!"
A shadow fell across the yard. Everyone looked up.
Aladdin's breath caught in his throat. Abu and the mat caught
each other in terror. Towering over them like an evil giant
genius. He put his hand on the roof of his mouth as if he was going to crush it.

Kun Aladdin heräsi, hänellä oli kylmä, jäätävän kylmä. Kuin hän
lumipankista jäinen tuuli vei lumen sisään
hänen kasvonsa.
Missä hän oli? Raivoavan lumimyrskyn läpi hän näki tornin
makaa paloina, puoliksi lumen peitossa. Juuri tuolla takana kallio syöksyi
alas pimeyteen.
Onnettomuus... se oli kaikki mitä hän muisti. Se piti heittää pois
ulos tornista tajuttomana.
Ruskea pallo kiinnitti hänen huomionsa. "Abou!" Hän soitti
tärisevät hampaat. Hän juoksi ja veti lemmikkinsä ulos lumesta. "Ovat
Miten menee?"
Vaestessaan Abu nyökkäsi heikosti.
Aladdin työnsi Abun takkiinsa. "Voi, Abu, tämä kaikki on minun syytäni
Minun olisi pitänyt vapauttaa henki, kun minulla oli mahdollisuus. Jotenkin minä
Minun täytyy palata ja saada asiat kuntoon. »
Hän tunsi kutitusa jalassaan. Pyöriä
ympärillä, hän näki maton liikkuvan häntä kohti. Hänet jäi kiinni
tornin valtavan palan alla.
Aladdin yritti vapauttaa maton, mutta hän oli lujasti jumissa. Hän ja
Abu alkoi kaivaa kaivantoa sen ympärille, mutta torni alkoi horjua.
"Huomio!" Aladdin huusi. Torni alkoi vieriä heitä kohti.
Nopeasti laskeessaan Aladdin livahti pois ja kietoi Abun syliinsä. THE
torni kaatui heidän ylitseen, juuri siellä, missä oli avautuva ikkuna.
Vahingoittumattomina he näkivät tornin syöksyvän kallion yli.
Vapautuneena tornista matto poimi Aladdinin ja Abun ja
lensi pilvien yläpuolella.
"Erittäin hyvä", Aladdin huusi. "Nyt mennään takaisin Agra-bahiin!"
Jafar rakasti näkymää uudesta valtaistuinhuoneestaan. Palatsi oli
minne hän nyt kuului – vuoren huipulla, ei niiden joukossa
väestöstä. Hän siemaili iloisena viinilasiaan henkien aikana
hieroi jalkojaan. Entinen sulttaani on nyt erotettu
kattoon kuin nukke. Hän oli pukeutunut narrin asuun ja Jafariin
ja Lago nauroi tälle naurettavalle näytelmälle. Rajah, vielä kissanpentu, kävelee
ahdistuneena häkissä.
Jasmine istui ikkunalla, ranteet kahleissa, silmät täynnä
surullisuus.
Jafar otti yhteyttä tiimiinsä. Hän laittoi ketjut hänen päälleen ja veti
sen läheisyys. "Minua sattuu nähdä, että olet tyytynyt tähän. Jasmine. Sinä
pitäisi olla maailman vaikutusvaltaisimman miehen käsivarressa.
sauvansa aallolla hän sai ketjunsa katoamaan. Päälle ilmestyi kruunu
hänen päänsä. "No, sinun kanssasi kuningattarena..."
Jasmine otti lasinsa ja heitti viinin hänen kasvoilleen. "Ei koskaan!"
Jafar hyppäsi valtaistuimelta. "Vihaa, vihaa. Jasmiini", murisi
Jafar. "Tiedät mitä tapahtuu
kun käyttäydyt huonosti. Aion opettaa sinulle kunnioitusta!"
Hän tuijotti henkiä. "Nero, päätin esittää viimeisen toiveeni
"Toivon, että prinsessa Jasmine rakastuisi minuun toivottomasti!"
"Ei!" » Jasmine sanoi ja astui taaksepäin.
"Oh, mestari", sanoi henki, "en voi tehdä sitä..."
"Teet niin kuin minä käsken sinun tehdä, orja!" Jafar karjui samalla kun hän
tarttui henkipartaan.
Kukaan ei huomannut Aladdinia ja Abua kurkistamassa valtaistuinhuoneeseen.
ikkuna heidän takanaan – ei kukaan muu kuin Jasmine.
Hän oli huutamassa, kun Aladdin hiljensi hänet.
sormi suulla. Hän, Abu ja matto kiipesivät
hiljaa huoneessa.
Jasmine thought quickly. “Jafar,” she said with a seductive smile, “I do
I never realized how incredibly beautiful you are!"
Jafar turned around. His jaw hung open in disbelief—just like
that genius.
"That's better," Jafar said. She snuggled up to Jasmine with a smile
on his face. "Now tell me more... about myself."
"You're tall, dark…" Jasmine saw Aladdin, Abu, and the carpet
sneaking towards the lamp. Now the spirit also saw them. It was
trying to stifle excited laughter.
"Go on…" Jafar said.
Abu was inches away from Lago now – and Lago turned around.
Jasmine quickly wrapped her arms around Jafar and locked him in place.
"You are well dressed," he continued. "You stole my heart"
With a quick jump, Abu grabbed Lago's perch and held out his hand.
into his mouth. Both fell to the ground.
"What about a street rat?" » said Jafar approaching Jasmine.
"What street rat?" asked Jasmine,
Crasshhh! Abu and Lago crashed into the table and dispatched the pot
down.
Jafar started to turn around. Jasmine had no choice but to pull him closer
and kiss her passionately and on the lips.
Now Aladdin had a chance to act. But he couldn't move. All that he
couldn't help but watch. There she was, the girl he had risked for
her life, kiss her... her,
Jafar stepped back. He was stunned with joy until he saw his reflection
From Aladdin in Jasmine's Crown.
"You!" he said turning in blind rage. His arm was broken
forward, pointing his wand at Aladdin.
Zzzzzzz! A flash of light struck Aladdin's chest. He flew
backwards, bumping into a pile of jewelry.
"How many times do I have to kill you, boy!" Jafar said pulling his own
hand back for another shot.
Jamsine lunged at him and threw his hand away.
"You treacherous brat!" Jafar growled. "Your time is up!"
He swung his wand at Jasmine. He was immediately trapped a
a giant hourglass. The upper room was full of sand, and little by little
fell through the opening
on top of him. It was more than enough to bury him alive.
Zzzzz! Jafar transformed Abu from his wand by swinging a cymbal-eating toy monkey.
Zzzzz! The carpet started to unravel. Aladdin ran to stop him. Jafar
" shouted, "Things change fast, son.
"It's all your fault, street rat! You never should have come back!"
Zzzzzzz! Aladdin jumped back. The sword hit the ground
next to him, then another. He looked up. Dozens of razors
swords fell from the ceiling.
Jafar made another gesture and a wall of fire erupted from the ground.
Aladdin grabbed one of the fallen swords. “Are you afraid to hit me
yourself, you cowardly snake? » said Aladdin pushing the swords away.
when they fell.
Jafar walked towards Aladdin forcing him closer to the fire.
"A snake, right? Maybe you'd like to see how much I can look like a snake!"
Jafar held out his snake staff with both hands. He began to grow,
takes up a monstrous life and wraps himself in Jafar's skin. Swelling,
With a hiss, Jafar became a monster
cobra, head raised towards the ceiling. The flames rose with him,
turning into a ring of mortal coils surrounding Aladdin.
With an unearthly roar, Jafar charged forward. Aladdin swung his sword.
Shine! He hit two of Jafar's teeth, which fell to the ground on impact.
"Rickum-rackum, thrust this sword into this snake," the spirit
shouted.
"Stay out of here!" » » Jafar hissed. He lunged again with a thump
Aladdin in the country. The sword flew from his hand.
"Under!" » exclaimed the sultan, looking helplessly from above. "Jasmine!"
Aladdin walked away when he saw the hourglass. Sand
had quickly stood up, covering everything but Jasmine's head.
Without his sword, there was only one option. Aladdin ran after
from the window and jumped to the balcony. Jafar slipped behind him. Quickly
Aladdin ran back and then escaped through another window.
Jafar followed her from window to window, wrapping her long body in a
node. He screamed in pain.
Aladdin took his sword and ran towards the hourglass.
Jasmine's nose was barely above the sand, her eyes wide with fear.
Aladdin pulled out his sword and was ready to break the glass.
With a powerful boom, Jafar brought down the wall. He was free...
and he threw his coils round Aladdin.
Aladdin's sword got caught mid-flight. It was difficult for him to free himself.
"You thought you could outsmart the most powerful being on the planet!"
» Jafar shouted.
Aladdin twisted left and right. In the corner of the room, genius
looked helpless.
Nero!
Thinking quickly, Aladdin said, "You're not that powerful. Genie is
more power than you ever have! He gave you your strength, and he
I can take it off!"
Genie hid behind a pillar. "Al, what are you doing? Why
Are you dragging me into this? »
"Look at that, Jafar, you're still only the second," Aladdin continued.
Jafar found his bond. He turned his slimy face towards the spirits.
"You're right. His power surpasses mine, but not by long!"
Aladdin fell to the ground as Jafar slid across the ground.
bedroom. "Slave!" Jafar summoned the spirits. “I'm ready to do a third
wish. I want to be... an almighty genius!”
Genie looked at Aladdin, his blue face now white as chalk. "Your
"I hope," he said in a slightly shaky voice, "that's my order!"
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Genie made a gesture. Surrounded by a swirling flow of energy
Jafar, and he began to shapeshift. The fire is gone. His
the body of the cobra grew wider and wider until it assumed roundness
a genius. "Yeah!" » Jafar shouted. 'Power! Absolute power!”
Quickly Aladdin took his sword and broke the hourglass.
Jasmine slid forward in a cascade of sand. "What you have
Is it done?” he asked as Aladdin released him.
Aladdin smiled. 'Trust me."
"The universe is an open book before me!" Jafar shouted. "Mining
command, rule!” The dome of the palace exploded as Jafar stood up
to the sky.
Before he could say a word, the golden chains tightened around his body.
wrists, just like those worn by the spirit. A bulb began to form
beneath him, new and shiny.
"What? What's going on?" » asked Jafar.
"Did you want to be a genius?" Aladdin took the new lamp and
handed it to Jafar. "You got it and everything that goes with it!"
Jafar's feet were nothing more than a vapor trail, a trail that disappeared inside
lamp nozzle. "No!" » he said, his eyes bulging with terror.
"Noooooooo!"
Yelling, Jafar raised his arms. Their fingers
he squeezed Lago's legs. "What... hey! Let go!" Lago shouted.
In a boring voice! Jafar and Lago were sucked into the lamp.
Everyone in the throne room fell into a great silence. Jasmine,
the Sultan, and the genie looked at Aladdin.
"Phenomenal cosmic powers," Aladdin said with a shrug. "Toddler
Living space!"
Genie laughed widely. "Al, you little genius!"
Immediately the room began to return to normal. Back on his feet,
The Sultan let out a sigh of joy as his robe materialized on him. Abu
became a living monkey again. The Rajah turned into a tiger again, breaking
released from a small cage. And the carpet looked brand new.
Genie grabbed the lamp and headed for the balcony.
"Shall we go? Ten thousand years in the Cave of Wonders should chill us
“He turned and threw the lamp and sent it flying overhead.
towards the desert.
Smiling proudly, the genie flew out. It took a gigantic shape,
took the whole palace and began to restore it to its proper place
place.
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Later that day when Agrabah had returned
normal. Jasmine and Aladdin stood in the throne room
balcony.
“Jasmine,” Aladdin said softly, “I'm sorry I lied to you….
prince."
Jasmine nodded. "I know why you did it."
"I guess this is goodbye?"
Jasmine turned away. "This stupid law! It's not fair!" Slowly,
in tears she faced Aladdin again. "I love you."
Suddenly a spirit appears from the window. “Al, it's okay…
You only have one wish left. Just say the word and you'll be a prince again!"
"But Genie," said Aladdin. "And your freedom?"
"Al, you're in love. You won't find another girl like this
millions of years. Believe me, I looked."
Aladdin looked mentally at Jasmine. He knew how much
now means freedom. Not just for Genius, but for Jasmine – and for it
he himself. Just like he needed
to be free from the Sultan's laws, Aladdin had to be free too. Free to be
he himself.
“Jasmine…I love you,” he finally said. “But I can't pretend I am
something I am not.
Jasmine lowered her head. "I understand."
"Genie," said Aladdin, "I desire your freedom. It is time that I
I began to keep my promise.
The spirit's golden cuffs disappeared in an instant. He was amazed. "Quickly!
Wish for something, anything! Say, "I want the Nile!" »
"Oh, I hope for the Nile," Aladdin said.
"AT LEAST!" said the spirit with a laugh. "I am free!" he cried, his
the face lights up. "I'm free! I'm going to explore the world!"
"Pat on the back!" » said the sultan, looking behind him.
"Qenie, I'm going to miss you," Aladdin said.
"Me too, Al," the spirit replied with a gentle smile. “No matter what
everyone says you will always be a prince to me! »
"Properly!" the sultan accepted.
"You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned. If the problem is the law, then what's going on?"
we need a new law!"
Jasmine looked at him in surprise. "Father!"
"From this day forward, the princess will marry whomever she deems worthy!"
"I choose you, Aladdin!" Jasmine immediately cried.
Aladdin was delighted. “Call me Ali,” she said.
He and Jasmine burst out laughing.
Aladdin took her in his arms and they both started spinning on the balcony.
"GOOD!" said the spirit with a wide smile, “I can't do any more damage here.
And now I'm leaving here!
Goodbye, you crazy lovebirds! »
Nero launched into the sky like a rocket.
The Sultan followed him with his eyes until the spirit disappeared into the horizon.
Aladdin and Jasmine didn't even notice her leaving.
As they shared a long, dreamy kiss, they didn't notice much else but each other.


ALADDIN: THE COMPLETE SCRIPT

PEDGER: Oh, I'm from the country
    From a distant place
    Where the camels of the caravan roam
    Where your ear was cut off / where it's flat and huge
    If they don't like your face / And the heat is fierce
    It's barbaric, but hey, it's my home!

    And the sun comes from the west
    And the sand in the glass is real

    The young man who loved this lamp was more than him

    throws sand into the sky where it forms a starry sky

(Camera tilts to see JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
    on his shoulder. GAZEEM arrives towards two.)

JAFAR: You're late.
GAZEEM: A thousand apologies, oh patient one.
JAFAR: Do you have it then?
GAZEEM: I had to cut a couple of throats to get it. (Comes out
        half of the medallion. JAFAR is looking for her,
        but GAZEEM pulls it back.) Ah, ah, ahhh! Treasure!
        (IAGO shouts as he passes and seizes the locket.) Alas!
JAFAR: Believe me, my spicy friend. You get what it is
        comes to you.
IAGO: What ails you! Ouch!

(JAFAR takes the other half of the locket. He connects
    them, and the bug locket will start to glow. Finally he
    flies from JAFAR's hands scaring the horses and leaves
    towards the dunes.)

JAFAR: Quick, follow the path!

(Everyone leaves after the point of light, until
    we arrive at a large dune. It is separated into two and
    the halves plunge into the dunes. Only two brilliants left
    points of light on the dune. But then the dune starts to rise
     turning into a giant lion's head with a shining
    the dots act as eyes.)

JAFAR: Finally, after all my years of research, the cave
        wonderful things!
IAGO: Oh! Cave of Wonders!
GAZEEM: By Allah!
JAFAR: Now remember! Bring me the lamp. The rest
        the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!

(GAZEEM begins to approach the lion's mouth, which forms
    the entrance to the cave. He laughs as he walks.)

IAGO: Awk, the lamp! Awk, the lamp! (Now that IAGO and
    JAFAR is alone, IAGO opens in normal English.)
    Damn, where did you find this asshole?

(JAFAR puts his finger to his lips and silences him. GAZEEM catches up
    into the cave, but has exploded from the roar of the cave's words.)

CAVE: Who disturbs my sleep?
GAZEEM: It is I, Gazeem, the humble thief.
CAVE: Know that. Only one can come here. The one whose
        value is far within. A diamond in the rough.

(GAZEEM turns to JAFARI with a questioning look.)

JAFAR: What are you waiting for? Jack!

(GAZEEM hesitates and then advances his foot into the cave. With
    great fear, he plants his foot. Nothing happens.
      Relieved, he continues his journey. Then comes another scream.
     He turns around, but the lion's mouth closes and the dune
    returns to normal. Only JAFAR, IAGO,
     and the two separate halves of the medallion.)

CAVE: Find yourself, diamond in the rough.

(IAGO comes out of the sand coughing.)

IAGO: I cannot believe it. I just don't believe it. Were
        I'll never get my hands on that stupid lamp! Only
        Forget it. Look at this. Look at this. I am so

        JAFAR's shoulder.)
JAFAR: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem apparently was
        less than worthy.
IAGO: (very sarcastic) Oh, there's a big one
        surprise. That's amazing - I think I can

JAFAR: Yes, we do. Only one can enter. I need to find this
        one, this... diamond in the rough.

(Cut to the roof where ALADDIN rushes to the edge carrying
    a slice of bread. He almost drops it overboard.)

WARNING: Stop, thief! I will take the trophy from your hand,
        sorry rat!
ALADDIN: (He looks back, then down, then at the bread.) Everything
        that for bread?

(He jumps and lands on two ropes stretched between buildings
    dry clothes on. He goes through them and collects pieces
    and clothes on him as he walks. In the end, he is
    approaches the end of the rope in the window as the woman approaches
     out and pack the shutters. ALADDIN hits
    shutters and falls to the street, and his fall is interrupted
    many awnings and a pile of clothes around him. He shoots
     takes off his upper layer of clothes and prepares to partake of his bread
    When...)

RULER 1: There he is!
RULER 2: You can't get away that easily!
ALADDIN: Did you think it was easy?

(She looks at the three women and mocks them.)

RULER 1: You two, this way, and you with me. GOOD
        Look for it.

(ALADDIN puts a sheet over himself and wraps himself up to disguise himself.
    He rushes towards the women.)

ALADDIN: Hello, ladies.
WOMAN 1: You're in trouble a little early today, aren't you?
        Aladdin for us?
ALADDIN: A problem? Not at all. You'll only get into trouble if
        get caught--

(A hand grabs ALADDIN's shoulder and pulls him back. That's it
    the first RULER. (The mask of ALADDIN falls.)

ALADDIN: I'm in trouble!
GUARD: ...and this time--(Screaming voice from ABU,
        then the guard's turban is lowered over him
        the eyes. ABU dances on VALVO's head, laughing.)
ALADDIN: Perfect timing, Abu!
ASHES: Hey!
ALADDIN: Come on, let's get out of here!
        I have to stay...one jump before the finish line
        One step ahead of the sword
        I only steal what I can't afford
        That's all!

(ALADDIN fights the sword-wielding RULER. He dodges a few
    swings and then pulls down the GUARD's pants. ABU raspberries
    WARNING, then dodge the attack. THE GUARD swings over ALADDIN,
    but destroys the fish barrel. As ALADDIN FINANCES, PROTECTS HIM
     pulls a fish on his lower body like pants.)

        A jump ahead of law enforcement
        That's it, and it's no joke
        These guys don't like that I'm broke!

(ALADDIN and ABU run over a stack of barrels, then knock over one.
    above the second RULER.)

GUARDS: (one at a time) Riffraff! Damn you rat!
        Charlatan! Take it!
ALADDIN: A little snack, guys!

(ALADDIN runs to the top of the stage. GUARDS shake
    the level moves back and forth trying to knock it over.)

GUARDS: Tear it up, take it back guys!
ALADDIN: I can take the hint, I have to face the facts
        You are my only friend, Abu!
WOMEN: Who?!?

(ALADDIN jumps off the stage to his death only to catch the ABUs.
    hands like an acrobat. The couple turns into a harem.)

        Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom
        He has become a bachelor who increases crime

(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth with it like a
    of course.)

WOMAN: I'd blame the parents, but he doesn't have them!
ALADDIN: I must eat to live, I must fly to eat
        I will tell you all about it when I have time!

(ALADDIN and ABU exit. Cut to MUSCLEMAN leaning into the crowd
    THE RULER hasten. Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind MUSCHEMMAN,
     matching his moves until they make a mistake and are caught.)

        Jump ahead of slow kicks
        One step ahead of my loss
        Next time I'll use a pen name.
        A jump ahead of the hitters
        A step ahead of the pack
        I think I'll go for a walk in the neighborhood.

(Will sequence where ALADDIN and ABU, behind the GUARDS,
    running through a herd of sheep, crossing the barrier of a MAN sleeping in bed
    claws {of course an extremely large WARNING descends upon him}. HAS BEEN DRINKING
     disguises himself in jewelry until the MERCHANT finds him.

CROWD: Stop, thief! Vandal!
        A shock! Scandal!
ALADDIN: Let's not hurry

(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of the door. The door opens
    and a big, ugly LADY comes out.)

LADY: Still, I think it's pretty tasty

(ALADDIN stoops and puts his arm around the RULER, acting as if
    as if they were all friends.)

ALADDIN: I must eat to live, I must fly to eat
        Otherwise we would get along just fine!
GUARDS: WRONG!

(They all jump up and fight. When they stop, ALADDIN and
    ABU left. They escape in barrels. They are running
    through a burning pit, after which the RUMINERS jump up and down,
    screaming in pain as he broke through the rocks. ALADDIN and ABU
    passes ua SWORD SWALLOWER, then ABU comes back, draws sword
    from NIELIJA's mouth. ABU advances on the guards,
    who shrink back in fear.)

RULER 1: He has a sword!
GUARD 2: You idiot, we ALL have swords!!

(ABU carefully lowers the sword and then runs. ALADDIN and ABU are
    surrounded once again, and RULERS come from left and right.
      He jumps and climbs for a dressage ride that is done in the street,
     when the GUARDS bump into each other.)

ALADDIN: One step ahead of the hoof beat!
CROWD: Vandal!
ALADDIN: One jump ahead of the hump!
CROWD: Street rats!
ALADDIN: A Journey Before Disaster
CROWD: Rogue!
ALADDIN: They are fast, but I am much faster
CROWD: Take it!

(GUARDS drive ALADDIN up the stairs into the room. He catches a
     carpet and jump out the window)

ALADDIN: Come on, I better put my hand in
        I wish you a safe landing
        All I have to do is jump!

(GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down
     street and land in a pile with a sign reading “Crazy Hakim’s
    Discount fertilizer.” ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
    to land safely and out of harm's way. ALADDIN and ABU congratulate each other
    sell.)

ALADDIN: And now, my lord, we celebrate! Clear!

(ALADDIN divides the bread in half and gives half to ABU, who begins
    eat. But ALADDIN looks and sees two little children
    rummage through trash to find food. The GIRL then sees it
    drops his find and tries to hide. ALADDIN then looks at them
    bread, then to ABU.)

ABU: Huh!

(ABU eats a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks
    for children. The girl removes her brother.)

ALADDIN: Well, take it.

(The children laugh with joy. ABU tries to swallow his morsel,
    then he looks guilty. He walks towards the children and offers them his
     bread for them. Joyfully, they patted him on the head.)

ABU: Ah, don't do that. Huh?

(ABU sees ALADDIN entering the daylight where there is a parade
    continues.ALADDIN looks over people's shoulders. He sees
    PRINCE ACHMED on horseback.)

PASSENGER 1: On the way to the palace, I guess.
BYSTANDER 2: Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is surprised when the two children run out of the room.
    alley. The BOY runs in front of the PRINCE's horse,
    surprise him.)

PRINCE: Out of my way, brat!

(The PRINCE raises his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN
    jump in front of them and grab the whip.)

ALADDIN: Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford certain habits
PRINCE: Oh... I'll teach you manners!

(THE PRINCE throws ALADDIN into a puddle of mud. The audience laughs at him.)

ALADDIN: Look at that, Abu. It's not every day you see a
        a horse with two hindquarters!

(The PRINCE stops and turns to ALADDIN.)

PRINCE: You're a worthless street rat. You were born in
        street rat, you die street rat, and that's it
        your fleas will cry for you.

(ALADDIN rushes to the prince, but the castle doors close
    on his face.)

ALADDIN: I am not useless. And I don't have fleas. Come
        Go ahead, Abu. Let's go home.

(ALADDIN walks into his house to see the view and then returns
    ABU for the night.)

ALADDIN: Riffraff, katurotta.
        I don't buy it.
        If only they would take a closer look
        Would they see the poor boy? No father.
        They would find out, there is so much more to me.

(He pulls back the curtain to reveal a magnificent palace.)

        One day, Abu, things will change. Welfare
        rich, I live in a palace and I never have any problems
        at all.

(Dissolves to the same level during the day. Interior picture of SULTAN's bedroom.
     The door suddenly opens and PRINCE ACHMED bursts in, missing
    the back of the pants.)

PRINCE: I have never been so insulted!

SULTAN: Oh Prince Ahmed. You're not leaving that early, are you?
        You?

PRINCE: Good luck marrying her!

SULTAN: Oh Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! (The SULTAN leaves
        goes to the garden to look for his daughter. He
        finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, son of JASMINE.
        a pet tiger that prevents it. RAJAH has a piece
        from the prince's underpants to his mouth.SULTAN
        grabs the cloth and removes it from RAJAH's mouth.)
        To hell, Rajah! Hence Prince Ahmed
        hit!
JASMINE: Oh dad. Rajah was just playing with him,
        Aren't you Rajah. (RAJAH approaches and allows
        JASMINE strokes and hugs him.) You were just playing
        with this overdressed and self-absorbed Prince Ahmed,
        Is not it ? (She snuggles against RAJAH, enjoying
        for a moment until he looked up at his angry father. )
        Hmm.
SULTAN: My dear, you must stop rejecting all the suitors
        who will call. The law says...
BOTH: ...must be married to a prince.

(They head towards the pigeon cage.)

SULTAN: Until your next birthday.
JASMINE: The law is wrong.
SULTAN: You only have three days left!
JASMINE: Dad, I hate this. (He takes
        pigeon from the cage and caresses it.) If I marry,
        I want it to be for love.
SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this law. (She hands him out
        the pigeon, and he puts it back in the cage.) I'm not
        It will be there forever and I just want to do it
        sure you will be taken care of, expected.
JASMINE: Try to understand. I've never done anything to myself
        own. (He twirls his finger in the water
        pond, petting fish.) I've never had a real one
        friends. (RAJAH looks at him and growls.)
        Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he returns
        sleep.) I never even left the palace
        the walls.
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.
JASMINE: So maybe I don't want to be a princess. (He
        water splashes.)
SULTAN: Oooohhh! May Allah protect you
        girls!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a moment. JASMINE walks towards the pigeon.
    cage and open the door by pulling. Birds fly to freedom.
      He watches them leave. Cut int. from SULTAN apartments.)

SULTAN: I don't know where he got it. His mother
        it wasn't that difficult. (A shadow falls on him.
        He looks up in surprise and sees JAFAR.) Ooh, oh.
        Ah, Jafar, my most trusted advisor. I'm in
        desperately need your wisdom.
JAFAR: My life is only to serve you, my lord. (He bows.)
SULTAN: It's this suitor thing. Jasmine refuses
        choose a husband. I'm at the end of my thread.
IAGO: (in parrot voice) Awk! Roll head.
SULTAN: Ah, ha, ha. Have fun, pretty Polly! (He
        takes a cookie out of his pocket. IAGO shows
        in terror. Then SULTAN puts it on IAGO
        into the mouth. IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it. JAFAR
        and SULTANI both laugh.)
JAFAR: Your majesty must have a problem with stupid animals.
        (IAGO looks at him.) Now perhaps I can
        guess the solution to this difficult problem.
SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you.
JAFAR: Ah, but that would require the use of mystical blue
        diamond.
SULTAN: Oh, my ring? But it's been in the family ever since
        years.
JAFAR: We need to find a suitor for the princess.
        (JAFAR pronounces the word "princess" with emphasis
        second syllable "cess". He turns his wand
        with the cobra's head towards the SULTAN. The eyes
        the stick starts to glow. The room goes dark, JAFAR's room
        the voice slowed and deepened. SULTAN eyes
        get a hypnotized look.) Don't worry. All
        will be good.
SULTAN: Everything will be fine.
JAFAR: A diamond.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Everything you need is in order.

(The SULTAN takes off his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room lights up
    back to normal when JAFAR removes the stick.)

JAFAR: You are very kind, Liege. Now run and
        play with your little toys.
SULTAN: (Still hypnotized) Yes... it's going to be... pretty good.

(JAFAR and IAGO come out. We follow them. As they leave the room,
    the parrot spits out cookies.)

IAGO: I can take no more! If I have to choke
        another one of those moldy, disgusting cookies... bam!
        Hit!

(JAFAR pulls a rope that reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)

JAFAR: Calm down, Iago.
IAGO: Then I seized his head. Hit! Hit!
JAFAR: (Talking to IAGO.) Soon I'll be Sultan, won't I
        this confused idiot.
IAGO: And then I shoved crackers down his throat! Huh
        Hah!

(The couple enter the door and slam it. Diss. towards the garden.
    evening. A dark figure walks through. We see it's JASMINE
    disguised. He reaches the palace wall and then starts to climb it.
      RAJAH pulls him from behind.)

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and
        Let my life live for me. I will miss you. (He
        starts to climb again and RAJAH helps him,
        who begins to whine and complain.) Goodbye!

(He disappears over the wall. Picture of the day on ALADDIN street
    and ABU are ready to get into trouble again. They are at the top
    fruit stand awning.)

ALADDIN: Okay, Abu. Go!

(ABU dives overboard and looks at the OWNER.)

OWNER: (To Owner) Try this, taste buds
            dances and sings. (ABU catches the melon and
            hangs there and distracts him.) Hey,
            get your paw off of it.
ABU: Blah blah blah!
OWNER: Well you! Get out of here you dirty monkey!

(He grabs the melon from ABU's hands. But in the foreground ALADDIN
    bends down and grabs another melon from the stand.)

ABU: Goodbye!

(He gets up. OWNER brings a melon in front,
    where he puts it on top of the pile. He looks confused
    he just did it.)

ALADDIN: Well done, Abu. Breakfast will be served.

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof open a melon and eat. We see J
    ASMINE walking down the street.)

SHOP 1: Beautiful woman, buy a pot. There is no finer brass vessel
            or money.
MERCHANT 2: Sweet dates, sweet dates and figs! Sugar
            dates and pistachios!
SHOP 3: Should a woman wear a necklace? Pretty
            a necklace for a beautiful woman.

(He is enamored with the action, but is surprised by the fish attack
    on his face.)

SHOP 4: Fresh fish! We catch them, you buy them!
JASMINE: I don't think so. (He steps back, but crashes
        a fire eater who is surprised after swallowing his own
        fire.) Sorry. (He swallows and then belches
        fire comes from his mouth. JASMINE hates. She is
        happy and patting his belly. ALADDIN sees him,
        and a strange look appears on his face.) I am
        really sorry.
ALADDIN: (He is obviously deeply in love with her.) Wow!

(He pulls his jacket over Hupu's head. ABU sees this and
    leaps onto his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN
    face.)

ABU: Ooh. Good morning? Good morning?

(JASMINE stops at a fruit stand and sees a young homeless child.
    look for a piece of fruit. He takes one and gives it
    him.)

JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here is. (THE
            the boy runs away.)
OWNER: You better be able to pay for it.
JASMINE: (Mystified) Liver?
OWNER: No one steals my basket!
JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I do not have money.
OWNER: Thief!
JASMINE: Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can
            get from the sultan.
OWNER: Do you know what the punishment is for theft?

(He takes her hand and pins it on the table deliberately
    stop.)

JASMINE: No, no, thank you!

(The sword falls, but is stopped by ALADDIN's hand.)

ALADDIN: Thank you, good sir. I'm so glad you found it
            his. I'm looking for you everywhere.
JASMINE: (whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN: (whispering back) Play along.
OWNER: Do you know this girl?
JASMINE: Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister. He is a little
            crazy. (He puts his fingers around his ears.
            He is upset. OWNER catches it
            sand.)
OWNER: He said he knew the Sultan!
ALADDIN: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU picks his pockets. He hears this and then gets up.
    JASMINE, soittaen mukana, polvistuu ja kumartuu ABU:lle.)

JASMINE: Voi viisas sulttaani. Kuinka voin palvella sinua?
ABU: No, blaa blaa blaa.
ALADDIN: Traagista, eikö? (Hän nojaa eteenpäin ja valitsee
            ota kärrystä toinen omena sen kanssa
            jalka.) Mutta mitään vahinkoa ei tapahtunut. (Hän kävelee kohti
            Jasmine.) Tule nyt sisko. On aika nähdä
            lääkäri.
JASMINE: (lähellä seisovalle kamelille) Hei tohtori.
            Miten menee?
ALADDIN: Ei, ei, ei. Ei tämä. (ABU:lle, mukaan lukien
            taskut ovat pullistuneet.) Tule, sulttaani.

(ABU kumartuu yleisölle ja kaikki, mitä hän varasti kärryistä, putoaa
    ulos.)

OWNER: Huh? What is this? (ABU picks up what it can
            bear, and the trio escape.) Come back here,
            you little thieves!

(Cut to inside the JAFAR laboratory. IAGO is spinning a gear in a strange state.
    gadgets. There is a storm on top of the ship.)

IAGO: (flushing and blowing) With all due respect, yours
        rotten, can't we wait for a real storm?
JAFAR: Hold your breath, Iago. Faster! (He sets
        SULTAN'S RING in the boat.)
IAGO: Yes, oh great evil.

(IAGO runs faster. Lightning crosses the ring, passing in front
    in the hourglass below. The sand starts to turn.)

JAFAR: Ah, sands of time, reveal to me the one who can
        enter the cave. (The sand at the top forms a cave
        Miracles. He falls into a storm, but he
        shows ALADDIN climbing a ladder followed by
        JASMINE, who is covered with her coat.) Yes, yes!
        Here it is. My diamond in the rough!
IAGO: Is that him?!?! It's the clown we've been
        are you waiting (IAGO loses his footing and is forced to suck
        in gear.)
JAFAR: Let the guards send him an invitation
        palace, okay?

(IAGO walks past and hits the wall upside down.)

IAGO: Fine.

(JAFAR laughs horribly, and the camera zooms into the sandstorm
    Inside ALADD. Finally, we dissolve to the true escalation of ALADDIN
    at the top of the ladder followed by JASMINE.)

ALADDIN: I'm almost there.

(JASMINE climbs over, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
    He gets up.)

JASMINE: I want to thank you for arresting this man.
ALADDIN: Forget it. (He grabs the staff.) So, that's it
        first time on the market huh?

(ALADD pole-jumps to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE: Is it that obvious?
ALADDIN: Well, you stand out pretty well. (She looks at him,
        still in love. He returns the look. But he
        realizes what he's doing and returns to normal.)
        I mean, you don't seem to know how dangerous it is
        Agrabah can be. (He puts the board in between
        buildings he can walk on but when it leans
        at the bottom he jumps above her head. He looks back
        surprise. He throws a stick at her. Both
        ALADDIN and ABU's eyes are bulging.)
JASMINE: I'm a quick learner.
ALADDIN: That is true. Come here. (They come to the roof
        from the building, avoiding boards and beams as such
        come on.) Huh. Watch your head out there. Be careful.
JASMINE: Do you live here?
ALADDIN: Yes. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.
JASMINE: Great.
ALADDIN: Well, it's not much, (he draws the curtain and
        reveals the palace), but it offers a spectacular view.
        The Palace looks really great, doesn't it?
JASMINE: Oh, that's lovely.
ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there
        there are servants and servants...
JASMINE: Oh yeah. People who tell you where to go and how
        dress.
ALADDIN: It's better than here. Always looking for food
        and dodge the guards.
JASMINE: You are not free to make your own choices.
ALADDIN: Sometimes you feel so...
JASMINE: You just...
BOTH: (together) – trapped.

(They look at each other and realize they are perfect for each other
    second. But ALADDIN then realizes where he is and breaks it
    Look. He takes the apple from ABU's hand and spins it in his hand
    hand in JASMINE's hand.)

ALADDIN: So where are you from?
JASMINE: What does it matter? I ran away and I'm not
        return.
ALADDIN: Really? (He bites his apple
        hand and then holds it out to ABU who looks disgusted
        look at his face.)
ABU: Why you!

(ALADDIN walks and sits next to JASMINE.)

JASMINE: My father is forcing me to marry.
ALADDIN: It's... it's horrible. (ABU appears behind
        princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU runs to a higher level, chattering and cursing as he goes.)

JASMINE: What?
ALADDIN: Abu says... uh... that's not fair.
ABU: What?
JASMINE: Oh, right?
ALADDIN: Yeah, sure.
JASMINE: And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN: Well, he hopes he can do something
        cars.
ABU: Oh boy!
JASMINE: Hmm, tell her that's very nice.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE come closer and closer until
    ALADDIN leans in to kiss him. However, it is interrupted
    GUARDS who found them.)

RULER: There you are!
ALADDIN and JASMINE: They found me! (to each other) They are
                When you are?
JASMINE: My father must have sent them...
ALADDIN: Do you trust me?
JASMINE: What?
ALADDIN: Do you trust me? (She holds out her hand)
JASMINE: Yes. (He takes it.)
ALADDIN: Then jump!

(Both jump from the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt
    try to escape, but the GUARD blocks the exit.)

WARNING: We keep crossing paths, don't we,
        street rat?

(Again, ABU shot VALTIJAN's turban, but the other guards shoot
    here and block the exit. The first RULER pulls the ABU off his head and
     throw it in the vase. Three more guards catch ALADDIN.)

RULER: This is a dungeon for you, son.
ALADDIN: Hey, let me go!
JASMINE: Let him go.
RULER: (Not realizing she's a princess) Look what we
        here, men, a street mouse. (He throws it away
        alas.)
JASMINE: (stands up and takes off the hood of her cloak)
        Let him go at the princess's command.

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)

PROTECTION: Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN: A princess?
ABU: (looks at vase) Princess?
RULER: What are you doing outside the palace? And with
        this street rat?
JASMINE: It's not your problem. Do as I say. Release
        him!
RULER: Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from there
        Jafar. You should discuss this with him.

(GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing.)

JASMINE: (looking very angry) Believe me, I do
        will.

(Points inside the palace, JAFAR comes out of his secret apartments. He
    gently slides open the door, but the princess rushes in
    before he finished. He closes it and traps IAGO inside.
    door frame.)

JASMINE: Jafar?
JAFAR: Oh, princess.
IAGO: Oh! Jafar, I'm stuck!
JAFAR: How may I be of assistance to you? (He spreads his
        cloak, hides the door.)
JASMINE: The guards just took a boy from the market onto you
        orders.
JAFAR: Your father accused me of keeping the peace inside
        Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.
JASMINE: What was the crime?
IAGO: I cannot breathe, Jafar!
JAFAR: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.
IAGO: If you could only... (JAFAR pushes him back inside
        the door and it slams) - wow, that hurts!
JASMINE: He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!
JAFAR: (walking away as if shocked) Oh my God! Oh why
        terribly annoying. If I would have known.
JASMINE: What do you mean?
JAFAR: Unfortunately, the boy's sentence has already been carried out
        out.
JASMINE: What sentence?
JAFAR: (sinful voice) Death. (JASMINE gasps.)
        By beating.
JASMINE: No! (He falls to the ground.)
JAFAR: I'm very sorry, princess.
JASMINE: How could you? (She runs out of the room crying.)

(IAGO finally manages to get through the door. He flies away and lands forward
    Jafar's shoulder, coughs.)

IAGO: How did it go?
JAFAR: I think he took it pretty well. (Both get a
        grim smile on their faces.)

(Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying by the fountain. RAJAH
    comes to comfort him. He caresses her.)

JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know him
        by them.

(Cut to dungeon. Rats rush out and we go down until we see
    ALADDIN chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN: (to himself) She was a princess. I do not believe
        he. I must have looked so stupid to him.
ABU: (distant) Yoo-hoo! Aladdin? Good morning!

(The ABU appears in the window at the top of the dungeon.)

ALADDIN: Abu! Here! Hey, help me out of this.

(ABU stops, then starts chatting wildly, falling to the ground. He
     wraps the cloth around her head and looks at him with big eyes
     imitation of a princess.)

ALADDIN: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, he was worth it.

(ABU jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulders and pulls out a small set of tools
    from his pocket and then releases ALADDIN.)

ABU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Abou. I will never see him again. I am
        street rat, remember, and there is a law. She is
        I have to marry the prince, he deserves it.

(ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands.)

ABU: No niin!
ALADDIN: (rubs his wrists) I'm—I'm a fool
OLD MAN: You're just a fool if you give in, son.

(We see an old man sitting in the corner, whom neither ALADDIN nor ABU
    I already saw that.)

ALADDIN: Who are you?
OLD: A humble prisoner like you. But together,
        maybe we can be more.
ALADDIN: I'm listening.
OLD MAN: There's a cave, son. Cave of Wonders. Ready
        with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
        Enough treasure to impress even your princess
        veto.

(Listeners note that the OLD Man said the word
    "princess" is "prince-CESS" instead of the usual pronunciation
     From "PRIN cess". OLD Man turns his back and IAGO remains
    his head sticking out of JAFAR's "old man" mask.)

IAGO: Jafar, can you hurry? I'm dying for this!
ALADDIN: But the law says that only a prince can marry...
OLD MAN: You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you, son?
        Whoever has the gold makes the rules. (He smiles,
        looks terribly bad-mouthed.)
ALADDIN: Then why would you share all this wonderfulness?
        treasure with me?
OLD MAN: I need a young man with strong legs and strong
        I'll be back there later.
ALADDIN: Ah, problem. It's outside, are we here?

(The OLD MAN walks towards the wall and pushes a hidden exit.)

OLD: Mmm, mmm, mmm. Things are not always what they seem.
        seem So, do we have a deal?

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs.)

ABU: Oh, um.

(Cut to wilderness scene. We see ALADDIN leading the horse
    OLD MAN and ABU in it. Insult. In the Cave of Wonders.)

CAVE: Who disturbs my sleep?
ALADDIN: It's me, Aladdin.
CAVE: Go ahead. Do not touch anything other than the lamp.

(The cave opens with a roar and the stairs appear in front
    ALADDIN. )

OLD MAN: Remember, my son, go get me a lamp first and then
        you get your reward.
ALADDIN: Come on, Abu. (To ABU hiding under the shoulder
        her vest.)

(ALADDIN begins to descend the stairs. He reaches the bottom
    and enters a golden chamber full of treasures.)

ALADDIN: Would you like to look at it!
ASHES: Ohoh!
ALADDIN: Just a handful of these things would make me richer
        like a sultan!

(ABU looks, sees the treasure, then rushes towards it.)

ALADDIN: Abu!

(ABU stops halfway, hovering over the carpet on the floor.)

ALADDIN: Don't touch anything! We need to find this lamp.

(They begin to walk across the room as the CARPET rises
    from the ground and starts following them. ABU has a feeling
    they are tracked.)

ABU: Häh?

(He turns around and MATTO is lying on the ground. He continues and
    MATO starts following again. Once again ABU turns around but
     The CARPET is rolled up and leaning against the treasure pile. HAS BEEN DRINKING
     runs towards ALADDIN and pulls his trouser leg.)

ABU: Aladdin! Aladdin!
ALADDIN: Abu, will you stop him?

(Again MAT follows, but this time when ABU turns, MAT
    jump to the other side. He descends with the pompom and pulls
    ABU's tail. When ABU jumps, MATO goes towards the other one again
     on the side of. This time, ABU lands in a karate stance. CARPET achieved
    lays down and takes off ABU's hat and then puts it on himself. ABU is sitting
    thought for a while, until MATO waved an acorn in front of him
     face. ABU and CARPET both jump in fear and run away. ABU attacks
     ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)

ALADDIN: Abu, what are you... crazy?

(A CARPET appears behind the treasure pile.)

ALADDIN: The Magic Carpet! Let's go. Go out. I'm not going
        hurt you.

(Mato comes out slowly, timidly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts
    it turns off. He flies towards ALADDIN and hands his hat to ABU next to him.
     him. (ABU shouts and jumps on ALADDIN's shoulder.)

ALADDIN: Calm down, Abu. He's not going to bite.

(MATO takes ABU's hat again and hands it to him. ABU trembles
    fists and shouts at it. MATTO begins to move away, "unfortunately".)

ALADDIN: Hey, wait a minute. Do not go. Maybe you can help
        We. (CARPET looks back excitedly. Then he flies away
        and wraps himself around the couple.) Hey, huh! You
        we are trying to find this lamp. (CARPET
        gestures for them to follow him.) I think he knows
        where is it.

(They go through a long cave until they become a giant
    an underground cave. In the center of the room is a large pillar,
     stairs leading to it. It is surrounded by water
     unevenly placed stones form a bridge. On
    the pillar is a ray of light. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN: Wait here!
ABU: You. Huh?

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey. Outstretched paws hold a
    a giant ruby. ABU is drawn there hypnotically. ALADDIN climbs
     the stairs quickly. CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail in a futile attempt
     to hold him. ALADDIN finally reaches the TAG LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Is that it? This is what we have come to
        here... (He looks down and sees ABU freeing himself
        from taking the CARPET and rush towards the jewels.) Abu-
        NO!

(ABU grabs the jewels. There is a rumble and the room begins to collapse.)
    shake.)

VOICES FROM CAVES: Infidels!
ASHES: Ohoh!
VOICE FROM THE CAVE: You have touched the forbidden treasure. (IT'S WONDERFUL
               put the jewel back in the paw, but the jewel
                and the shrine melts into lava.) Now you
                will never see the light of day again!

(ALADDIN runs down the stairs, but they flatten into a ramp, and he
    descends towards the sky until it flies into the air. The water changed
     wash. He falls towards her when suddenly TAPIS appears
    and catch him. ABU is standing on one of the rocks
    bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava.
    Then CARPET rushes in and ALADDIN catches him, just like the last stone
     explode.)

ALADDIN: Wow! Mats, let's go!

(Together they run through the caves avoiding walls and falls.
    garbage. (ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.)

ALADDIN: Abu, now is not the time to panic! (He withdraws from ABU
        head and sees that they fly against the wall.)
        Start panicking.

(CARPET goes into a dive and then through another cave. Finally they
    out through the inner door. Outside, the cave begins
     grunts and shuts down. MATO and the company are almost at the top when a
    the stone falls on the mat and sends it to the ground. ALADDIN catches up
    on the rock wall and hold on. He sees the old man at the top,
    at hand.)

ALADDIN: Help me!
OLD MAN: Throw me a lamp!
ALADDIN: I can't stand it. Give me your hand.
OLD MAN: Give me the lamp first!

(ALADDIN reaches out and takes the EARTH LAMP. He holds it out, a
    and the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)

OLD MAN: Ha ha ha ha! Yeah! finally! Ha ha ha ha!

(ALADDIN came out with the help of ABU. But OLD
     MAN pushes ABU away and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)

ALADDIN: What are you doing?
OLD MAN: I'll give you your reward. (JAFAR returns to him
        normal voice.) Your eternal reward.

(He takes out a coiled dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when
    ABU bites him on the wrist. He screams but lets go of ALADDIN,
     which falls into a cave. OLD Man throws ABU into the cave at the same time
     GOOD. They fall. CARPET can see this but is attached below
     rock. He struggles to free himself, then he does. It's a race
     and catches up to ALADDIN, but he's already hit the wall several times
    times and is unconscious. On the surface, the cave roars
    the last time then falls back into the sand. JAFAR succeeds
     his mask.)

JAFAR: Hey hey hey! It's mine. It's all mine! I (he can't
        find it in his pocket) --- where is it? No no!!

(The kiss disappears into JASMINE's room. She sits on her bed next to him
    To RAJAH who looks sad. SULTAN enters.)

SULTAN: Jasmine? Oh my darling. What's wrong?
JASMINE: Jafar... did... something... terrible. (He
        He seems to be crying.)
SULTAN: There, there, there, my child, we will make things right.
        Now tell me everything.

(Cut to inside the cave. ALADDIN lies unconscious on the WORM.
    (ABU tries to wake him up.)

ABU: Oh, oh. Aladdin? Wake up. Aladdin.

(TAPIT gets up and picks up ALADDIN. He slowly wakes up.)

ALADDIN: Oh my head. (He looks at the sealed entrance.)
        They were trapped. (Angry, clenching his fists towards
        entry) This two-faced son of a jackal! (calmer)
        Whoever it was, he's long gone with that lamp.
ABU: Yes!

(ABU takes out the MAGIC LAMP)

ALADDIN: Well, you little hairy thief! It looks like it
        decayed, worthless scrap. Hi, I think so
        there is something written here, but it is hard to understand
        kiss.

(He rubs the LAMP. Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole,
    The LAMP starts to shake and glow, but ALADDIN grabs the light.
    LAMP and our wonderful friend, GENIUS, appears.)

GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! Oh! Ten thousand years will give you
        what a pain in the neck! (He hangs ALADDIN a
        stone nearby. Then he rips his head off and turns
        around, yelling as he does it. A WORM pulls a
        under ALADD.) Wow! Does it feel good to be
        get out of here! (GENIE uses the tip of his lamp e.g
        microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and
        Messrs. Hi, where are you from? (He puts the microphone in
        (ALADDIN's face.) What's your name?
ALADDIN: Uh, al--uh--Aladdin.
GENIUS: ( pronounces his name as if he's discovered something
        middle finger) Aladdin! (The neon sign lights up
        It has ALADDIN's name surrounded by tracking lights. THE
        sign the changes that reflect the next line of GENIE.)
        Hello Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Butter
        we call you "Al?" » Or maybe just "Din?" "Or how
        about "Laddi?" » (GENIE disappears, then the dog
        wrapped in plaid jumps in.) It looks like, “Here boy!
        Come on, Laddi!
ALADDIN: (shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder.
        that I thought.
GENIE: (Still the dog) Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do? (Dog
        puff of smoke and then back to GENI. HAS BEEN DRINKING
        yells wildly.) Oh sorry Cheetah, I hope so
        I didn't smoke fur! Hi Rugman! I have not seen
        you in a few millennia! Give me the pompom! Hey!
        Yeah! (MATTO flies over and greets NERO.
        GENIUS looks at ALADDIN.) Say, you're much smaller
        as my last master. (He raises his beer belly.) Either
        That or I grow up. look at me
        aside, am I different from you?
ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I am... your master?
GENIUS: (He places the diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a
        mortar on the head.) That's right! he can
        let's teach!! What would you like from me, (like Arnold
        Schwarzenegger) always impressive, (in a
        cube) long content (such as ventriloquist
        mannequin) often imitated, (throws the mannequin aside)
        but never copied...

(He reproduces into several GENEs that surround him.)

DUP. GENIES: duplicated, duplicated, duplicated,
            duplicated duplicated duplicated
            duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.
GENIUS: (He says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.)
        Genius! Of! A lamp! (He enters Ed
        Sullivan) Here, straight from the lamp, that's right
        here for your greatest pleasure, to fulfill your wishes.
        Thanks uuuu!
ALADDIN: Wow! Wish fulfillment?
GENIUS: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-no
        wish for more wishes. (Turns into a lunge
        into the plane, the hand descends and three GENIUS appear inside
        windows.) Well, three. (Three GENIUS
        the caballeros come out of the opening.) Uno, dos, tres.
        (Change to Groucho Marx in black and white.) Nope
        exchanges, exchanges or returns. (Duck
        comes the secret word "returns".
ALADDIN: (to ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming.
GENIE: (Music from "Friend Like Me" begins) Master, I don't know
        I think you understand what you have here! SO
        why don't you ruminate while I shine
        potential. (GENIE lights up like a
        fluorescent lamp)

    Well, Ali Baba had forty thieves
    Scheherazade had a thousand stories
    But control yourself with luck, because you have your work cut out for you
    You have magic that never fails!

(The GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
    GENIUS appears in his vest, then puts his hand out and hits
    thieves to show.)

    You now have power in your corner
    Some heavy ammo in your camp
    You have punch, spice, yahoo and how
    See, all you have to do is rub this lamp
    And I say

(The boxing ring appears, in ALADD's corner, in the massage.
    by GENIUS. Then GENIE turns into a bunch of fireworks and
    explode. Then GENIUS appears inside the lamp and grabs ALADDIN's lamp.
     hand and rub the lamp with it.)

    Mr. Aladdin, sir
    What is your joy?
    Let me take your order, write it down
    You've never had a friend like me
    No no no!

(GENIE prepares the table and chairs and then writes things a
    notepad like server. )

    Life is your restaurant
    And I am your master!
    Come on, whisper what you want
    You've never had a friend like me.

(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken and then returns to normal,
    but widens his ears to listen to ALADDIN. Eventually it explodes
     in four GENIEs in duplicate.)

    Yes sir we are proud of our service
    You are the boss, the king, the shah!
    Say what you want, it's yours! A real dish
    How about more Baklava?

(The GENITS give him a shave, a haircut, and a manicure, then ALADDIN
    appears in a comfortable armchair (eh?) surrounded by treasure
    and excited by women. GENIUS appears and fills it
    display on baklava.)

    Try a little column "A"
    Try the entire column "B"
    I'm willing to help you man
    You've never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN stands atop a food column with a giant A at the top,
    then go to the second column with a B at the top. He will fall
    and gets caught in the pillow held by GENIE. He opens his mouth,
    and his tongue turns into a staircase. Miniature GENIUS
     dressed as a wizard.)

(Mini GENIE does a little dance with two GENIE giants
    in hands. At the end, they surround the mini GENIUS and crush
    it nowhere.)

    Can your friends do this?
    Do your friends do this?
    Will your friends pull this out of a small hat?
    Can your friends go crazy!
    Well, look here
    Can your friends go to Abracadabra, let them rip
    And then make this bastard disappear?

(NERO rips off his head, copies it, then juggles them.
    He throws them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins
    one end on a fingertip like a basketball. He throws
     the heads return to GENI, who tries to shoot
     itself pulled out of the hat by its base. It goes round and round and round
     until he turns into a white rabbit. The rabbit changes
    purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
     The dragon breathes fire which transforms into three HAREM GIRLS,
    who dance around ALADDIN. The moment he begins to appreciate them,
     They disappear.)

    So don't just sit there, limp, empty
    I am here to answer all midday prayers
    You got me in good faith, proof
    Do you have a genius in charge? business!
    I have a strong desire to help you
    So whatever you want, I really want to know
    You no doubt have a wish three miles long
    So all you have to do is rub like this, and oh!


(The GENIE imitates what he calls ALADDIN, then transforms
    a certificate that unfurls and surrounds ALADDIN. GENIUS shoots
     list {written in Arabic} of ALADDIN's ear, which he wears
    massaging your buttocks as if to dry yourself after a shower.)

    Mr. Aladdin, sir, I'd like two or three
    I'm at work, big mogul
    You've never had a friend, you've never had a friend
    You've never had a friend, you've never had a friend
    You've never... had... a friend... like... me!
    You've never had a friend like me!

(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one.
     He transforms into a GENIUS who displaces four dancing elephants
    existence. In the other direction he passes four dancing camels,
     and a big final dance number follows. ABU recovers so much gold
     as he can, but GENIUS packs everything into a cyclone and
    catch him until they are all back in the cave. GENIUS is a
    a neon "APPLAUSES" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat and
    sees it as empty.)

GENIE: What will it be, Master?
ALADDIN: Will you grant me my three wishes?
GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. There is
        some reservations, some considerations
ALADDIN: Like?
GENIE: Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anyone. (He
        cuts off his head with his finger.) So don't do it
        ask. Second rule: I can't make anyone fall in love
        with someone else. (The head turns into a large pair
        lips kiss ALADDIN.) You little punishment, there.
        (Lies flat, then stands up and changes
        zombie.) Rule Three: I can't bring people back from here
        dead. It's not a pretty picture, (He catches up
        ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like it! (He
        poofs back to normal.) Otherwise you have
        he!
ALADDIN: (looking at ABU as if scheming) Ah, reservations? You
        means restrictions? based on wishes? (to ABU) Some all
        powerful genius - can't even bring people back
        dead. I don't know, Abu - he might not even know
        get us out of this cave. Looks like we're going
        I have to find a way out of here...

(They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps in front
    them.)

GENIE: Excuse me? You see
        I? Are you rubbing my lamp? Did you wake me up?
        will you bring me here? And suddenly you are
        are you cheating on me? (Gets angrier and angrier) I
        I don't think so, not now. You have yours
        wishes, so sit down! (They all get to the MAT.
        GENIE is a flight attendant who has a lot
        the stem indicating the exits.) In that case
        Emergency, the exits are here, here, here,
        here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here
        here, anywhere! Keep your hands and arms inside
        carpet. Weeee'rrrrrrreee... get out of here!

(MATTO and passengers fly from the sand in the desert and fly away
    far. Cut int. From the SULTAN's room. JAFAR is
    there with IAGO, JASMINE and SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is a scandal. If that wasn't all
        years of good and loyal service... . From now on,
        you must discuss with me the sentencing of prisoners,
        before their heads were beheaded.
JAFAR: I assure you, Your Highness, this will not happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let's mess this up
        business behind us. Please?
JAFAR: My apologies
        well, princess. (He takes her hand to kiss it, but
        he rips it off.)
JASMINE: At least something good will come if I have to
        fuck. When I'm queen, I have
        strength to get rid of you.
SULTAN: That's nice. So everything was agreed. Now Jasmine,
        returns to this suitor relationship, (he
        looks and sees Jasmine coming out) Jasmine?
        Jasmine! (She runs after him.)
JAFAR: I wish I had that lamp!
IAGO: (As Jasmine) I have the power to get away
        You! I see! Thinking - we have to keep kissing each other
        until this idiot, and his idiot for his daughter
        the rest of our lives...
JAFAR: No, Iago. Only until she finds an idiot husband.
        Then he'll banish us... or behead us!
MOLEMAT: Eeewww!
IAGO: (having an idea) Oh! Wait a moment! Wait a moment!
        Jafar? What if you were an idiot husband?
JAFAR: (He looks at IAGO insultingly) What?
IAGO: Okay, you're going to marry a princess, okay? So, uh,
        you will be the sultan!
JAFAR: Oh! Marrying a snot? I will be the Sultan. The idea is
        deserved!
IAGO: Yes, deserve it! Yeah! And then we let the stepfather down and
        little woman on the edge of the cliff! (Enter the bombs
        floor) Kersplat!
JAFAR: Iago, I love the way your dirty little mind works!

(Both laugh as we go to an oasis in the desert where MATO is
    arriving for landing.)

GENIE: (Still as flight attendant) Thank you for choosing Magic
        Rugs for all your travel needs. Don't stand
        until the belt has stopped completely. (Like
        ALADDIN and ABU descend the staircase they form
        WORM) Thank you. Goodbye! THANK YOU!
        Bye! (Back to normal) Come on now. What would you say
        That, sir, do you suspect Mustafa?
ALADDIN: Oh, you showed me that well. Now for my three wishes -
GENIUS: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You are down
        Son!
ALADDIN: Ah, no, I never really wanted to leave
        cave. You did it alone.

(GENIE thinks for a moment, then her jaw drops. She changes
    sheep.)

GENIE: Well, don't I just feel dim? Well done to you
        baaaaad my son but no more presents.
ALADDIN: A fair deal. Three wishes, then. I want them to be
        GOOD. (GENIELE) What do you want?

(GENIE hangs like a hammock between two trees.)

GENIE: Me? No one has ever asked me that before. Come on in
        my case, ah, forget it.
ALADDIN: What? Won't tell me.
GENIUS: Freedom.
ALADDIN: Are you a prisoner?
GENIUS: It's all part and parcel, the whole concert of genius.
        (Becomes gigantic, voice resonates) Phenomenal cosmic
        strength! (Shrunk, cramped in the MAGIC LAMP.)
        Very small living space
ALADDIN: Genius, it's terrible.
GENIE: (Exiting the lamp) But oh... to be free. No
        I have to say, "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?
        do you need Poof! What do you need?” To be mine
        master, such a thing would be greater than all
        magic and all the treasures around the world! But
        what am i talking about here? Let's be realistic
        here. IT'S NOT HAPPENING. Genius, wake up and
        you smell like hummus
ALADDIN: Why not?
NERO: The only way we can get through this is if my lord
        I wish I would go out. So you can guess how often it is
        arrived.
ALADDIN: I will. I will set you free.
GENIE: (Head turns into Pinocchio's head with a long nose) Hmm
        Well that is true. Yell!
ALADDIN: Not really, I promise. (She sticks her nose in
        and the GENIE's head returns to normal.) After I have done mine
        The first two wishes, I use my third wish to define you
        free. (She holds out her hand)
GENIE: Well, I hope so. (He shakes ALADDIN's hand.)
        OK Let's do some magic! (Changes
        magician.) What then. what do you want
        most of them?
ALADDIN: Well, there's this girl...
GENIUS: Ehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIUS' chest shows a
        a heart with a cross through it.) Wrong! I can not
        make someone fall in love, remember?
ALADDIN: Oh, but Genie. He's smart and funny and...
GENIUS: Beautiful?
ALADDIN: Great. He has these eyes that... and
        that hair, wow...and her smile.
GENIUS: (I'm sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and MATO.)
        Am I. It's love.
ALADDIN: But she's a princess. For me to even have a chance
        I must be... Hey, can you make me a prince?
GENIE: Let's see here. (There is a "royal cookbook".) Um,
        Royal chicken? (There will be a chicken with a
        crown on head) No. Alaskan king crab?
        (He rips his fingers off, and we see SEBASTIAN's crab
        "The Little Mermaid" stuck.) Ouch, me
        I hate it when they do that. Caesar salad? (A
        (Tika comes out and tries to stab him.) And you,
        Bully? Ah, to make a prince. (He looks sly
        ALADDIN.) Now is this an official wish? Say it
        art!
ALADDIN: Genie, I wish you would make me a prince!
GENIE: Very good! Whoah Whoah Whoah Whoah! (Take a square
        shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. then comes
        tailor/fashion designer.) Firstly this Fez and
        The bodice combo is way too third century. These
        patches - what are we trying to say - beggar? No!
        Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN
        measure, snap your finger and ALADDIN is
        dressed in his prince costume.) I like it, muy
        macho! Now I need something else. What does it do
        Tell me? It's about the means of transportation. Excuse
        me, monkey boy! Aqui, this way! (ABU tries
        covers himself with a CARPET but is robbed by the GENIE and
        he flies over.)
ASHES: Ohoh!
GENIE: Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE play
        exhibition setting where ALADDIN stands on the podium
        "AL" in it.) And what better way to make your own
        the grand entrance to the streets of Agrabah, which
        Ride your very own brand new camel! Attention,
        it spits! (The door with the head of a GENIUS
        opens where ABU turns into a camel. He
        spits from the side of his mouth as a cue. But
        GENIE isn't sure.) Mmm, not enough. (He hits his
        fingers and ABU turns into a fine white horse.)
        It's still not enough. Wait and see. What do you need?
        (NERO snaps his fingers repeatedly and turns
        ABU in: duck, ostrich, turtle and '57
        Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1". (It's this
        I guess I don't know cars, but judging by the tail
        fins, said nuff.) Finally he returned
        normal.) Yes!! Esalalumbo, Shimin Dumbo! Wow!!
        (And as the spell keyword Dumbo, ABU changes
        like an elephant. CARPET is struggling to survive
        under ABU size 46 feet.) Talk about your frame
        subscribe, watch this action!

(ABU sees his reflection in the pool of water and then jumps into a tree.
     The wood naturally bends to the ground where ABU
     hangs and looks upside down at ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Abu, you look good.
GENIUS: He has an outfit, he has an elephant, but
        we are not ready yet. Hold on to your turban,
        boy, because we're gonna make you a star!

(We slowly fade into the oasis in the distance, like fireworks
    starts to explode outwards. Toys were shot into the CU pile.
    (Look for BEASTS here.) We bow and see the SULTAN
    balance them. He balances carefully on the last piece,
     then sits and sighs. However, JAFAR barges in and
    pile collapses.)

JAFAR: Sir, I found a solution to the problem
        your daughter.
IAGO: Oh! A problem with your daughter!
SULTAN: Oh, really?
JAFAR: (unrolls scroll) Here. “If princess
        did not choose a husband at the agreed time,
        then the sultan chooses for him.
SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all these suitors! (He tries
        put a cookie in IAGO's mouth. IAGO supports
        far. SULTAN distractedly pulls out some cookies
        back.) How could I choose someone he hates?
        (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly fills a
        make up in your mouth.)
JAFAR: Do not worry, my lord. There's more. If, in
        a case of not finding a suitable prince, princess
        then you have to get married... hmm... interesting.
SULTAN: What? WHO?
JAFAR: Royal Vizier! Well, that would be... me!
SULTAN: Well, I thought the law said only a prince could
        marry a princess, I'm sure of it.
JAFAR: Desperate times call for desperate measures
        Mr. (She takes out a stick and hypnotizes him
        SULTAN with it.)
SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...
JAFAR: You command the princess to marry me.
SULTAN: I... will... order... the princess...... (spell
        breaks off for a moment)...but you're so old!
JAFAR: (holds wand closer) The princess is getting married
        I!
SULTAN: The princess is getting married... (it's fate again
        broken, this time “Prince
        Ali".) What? What is it? This music! Ha ha ha.
        Jafar, you have to come see this!

(We see the parade marching forward, led by what appears to be a GENIUS
    human form as a major.)

WALKERS: Tell Prince Ali!
SWORDSMEN: Greetings! It's Prince Ali!
MAJOR: Hey, clear the road from the old bazaar,
    Hey you, let us go, it's a new bright star,
    Come on now, be the first in your neighborhood to catch her attention!
    Make way, here it is,
    Ring the bells, beat the drums.
    You will love this guy

(MAJOR mingles with a bunch of different members.)

    Prince Ali, wonderful he, Ali Ababwa!
    Genuine, show respect
    On your knees

(ABU the elephant crosses the city with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.)

    Now do your best to stay calm
    Improve your Sunday salami
    And come meet his awesome crew.

(IAGO dances to the music until JAFAR looks at him
    LARGE "wheelbarrows" place six men in the trunk of the ABU. They are standing
    on each other's shoulders when ALI shakes hands.)

    Prince Ali, great he, Ali Ababwa!
    Strong as ten ordinary men, definitely
    He galloped against the hordes
    A hundred evils with swords
    Who sent these idiots to their masters, why Prince Ali!

(The pile collapses on ALI, but the GENIE(tm) brand flash
    squeezes the stack and he ends up holding them all in an acrobatic move
     wheel formation. NERO turns into an old man and then a child
    and speaks the last two lines to the audience.)

MALE CHORUS: (Carrying camels) He has seventy-five golden camels!

(In Pops, a typical parade commentator)

HARRY: Aren't they lovely, June?

FEMALE CHORUS: (on a float) Purple peacocks, fifty-three of them!

(Another commentator arrives.)

JUNE: Great Harry, I love feathers!

GENIE: (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon gore descends
            parade)
    As for exotic mammals
    Does he have a zoo, I'll tell you
    This is a world class zoo!

(GENIE appears as a leopard, then a goat, and recites the last two
    lines for two children from earlier. We move to the balcony,
    where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by a HAREM GENIE.)

    NERO:
        GIRLS: (opposite point)
    Prince Ali, he is handsome, Ali Ababwa
        There is no doubt that Ali is attractive
    This physics, how can I speak
        Never ordinary, never boring
    Weak knee
        Everything about this man impresses
    Well come out to this place
        He is a miracle, he is a genius, a miracle
    Adjust your sails and get ready
        He's going to break my heart
    Hawk, crawl and stare at Prince Ali!
        And I love her outfit!

(JASMINE watches from the palace balcony. She
    he leaves, then leaves.)

CHORUS: He has ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
    (He has monkeys, Let's see monkeys!)
    And there's no charge to watch them!
    (He is generous, so generous)
    He has slaves, he has servants and henchmen!
    (Proud to work for him)
    They bend to his whims, love to serve him
    They're just asses when it comes to being loyal to Ali! Prince Ali!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins at people who rush towards him
    Collect them. ABU and the parade going up the steps
    palace and interior. SULTAN runs back to the door
    toward the throne room, but JAFAR is standing in front of the door.
    Suddenly, it opens up under the leadership of ABU and overwhelmingly
     JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

GENIUS: Prince Ali!
    In love with him! Ali Ababwa
    I hear your princess is a lovely sight!
    And so, folks,
    He got dressed and left
    Sixty elephants, llamas galore
    With its bears and lions
    Marching band and more
    With forty fakirs, a cook and a baker
    His birds are chirping on the sidelines
    Make way for Prince Ali!

(More and more fanfare builds until ALADDIN flies off on ABU's back.
    on the MAGIC CRPET mat and flies towards the SULTAN. JAFAR condemns
     closed door.)

SULTAN: (clapping) Wonderful, absolutely wonderful.
ALADDIN: (takes a deeper voice.) Ahem. Your majesty, I am
            I have come from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course. I'm satisfied
        to meet you. (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.)
        This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He is happy
        Also.
JAFAR: (Very dry) Ecstatic. I'm scared, prince
        Aboubou--
ALADDIN: --Ababwa!
JAFAR: It doesn't matter. You can't just scroll through this without being prompted
        and I'm waiting...
SULTAN: ...Allah, this is a truly remarkable device.
        (He pulls the pom poms, and they like his
        mustache.) I don't think I could...
ALADDIN: Of course, your majesty. I can.

(He helps the SULTAN to the MAT and he falls down.
    JAFAR pins MAT to the ground with a stick.)

JAFAR: Sir, I must advise you not to...
SULTANI: -- You can button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.

(He kicks the stick and MATO and SULTAN fly away. IAGO, who
    stood on the end of a stick, falls repeatedly
     striking the rod with its beak as it descends. SULTAN and
    MATO flies high up to the ceiling and then launches a bomb attack,
     flew under the ABU scaring him. The flight continues at
    in the background while JAFAR and ALI speak in the foreground.)

JAFAR: Where did you say you were from?
ALADDIN: Oh, much further than you've traveled, I'm sure.
        (He smiles. JAFAR doesn't.)
JAFAR: Try me. (IAGO lands on the stick.)
SULTAN: Look, Polly!

(They all fall back in time as the WORM turns green inches above their heads.)
    heads. THE WORM returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO into the room.)

IAGO: Hey, look at this. Look at him with that stupid carpet!

(MATTO zooms in below IAGO, who sighs, wipes his forehead and
    crashes into a pole. He hits the ground and his head
    it is surrounded by miniature SULTANS on RUGS, saying "Take a crack,
    there are cookies. The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Off, I'm coming down. Jafar,
        Look at that! (It descends.)
JAFAR: Awesome, Your Highness.
SULTAN: Oh, wonderful. Yes, I feel like I have a gift
        he. (CARPET heads towards ABU in a daze
        collapse. ABU catches him.) That's fine
        impressionable youth. And the prince too. (Whisper
        To JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to get married
        Jasmine after all.
JAFAR: I don't trust him, sir.
SULTAN: This is absurd. One thing I'm proud of, Jafar, I am
        an excellent judge of character.
IAGO: Oh, excellent judge, yes, of course... no!!!

(JASMINE enters quietly.)

SULTAN: Jasmine likes this!
ALADDIN: And I'm pretty sure I'm going to love Princess Jasmine!
JAFAR: Your Highness, no. I have to pray for Jasmine
        in the name of. (JASMINE hears this and gets angry.) This
        the boy is no different from the others. Who does
        does she think she is worthy of a princess?
ALADDIN: Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He injects
        JAFAR's goatee that flexes on all sides
        instructions.) Let him meet me. I win
        your daughter!
JASMINE: How dare you! (They all look at him in astonishment.)
        You all decide my future? I
        I am not a prize to be won! (He rushes out.)
SULTANI: Oh my God. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give it
        It's time for Jasmine to freshen up. (They go out.)
JAFAR: I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince
        Aboubou.

(Ask JASMINE on her balcony at night. We bow and find
    ALADDIN and company in the yard.)

ALADDIN: What am I going to do? Jasmine won't even let me
        talk to him I should have known I couldn't shoot
        of this foolish prince's wish. (ABU is struggling
        his elephant feet to open a banana. He crushes
        and a banana burst into his eyes. Then he
        throw the banana peel together
        even.)
GENIE: (on carpet, playing chess) So move! (MATTO does,
        drop the black piece off the board.) Hello.
        It's a good decision. (as Rodney Dangerfield) I
        I can't believe it, I'm losing all-in.
ALADDIN: Genius, I need help.
GENIUS: (As Jack Nicholson) All right, Sparky, here it is
        agreement. If you want to piss off a little lady, you have to
        Be a fair shooter, will you follow me?
ALADDIN: What?
GENIE: (Returning to normal, carrying a grenade launcher. He points
        write his words on the board) Tell him
        truth!!!
ALADDIN: No way! If Jasmine found out I really am someone
        dirty street rat, he makes fun of me. (He
        puts on his turban, which lights up like a GENIUS.)
GENIUS: A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh!
        (ALADDIN pulls the chain and turns off the lights.
        THE GENIUS comes out with a real turban.) Al, everyone
        kidding aside, you really should be yourself.
ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing I want to be. Clear,
        I'm going to go see him. I must be sweet, cool,
        confident. How do I look?
GENIE: (Sadly) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN flies to the balcony on the CARPET. JASMINE is on her bed,
    sigh. RAJAH is on her side.)

ALADDIN: (Far away) Princess Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and sighs.)

JASMINE: Who's there?
ALADDIN: It is I, Prince Ali. Ahem--(Then he leaps towards his own
        deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE: I don't want to see you.
ALADDIN: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance. (RAJAH
        grunts and moves towards him.)
JAFAR: Leave me alone.
ALADDIN: Down with the cat!

(On the other side of the balcony CARPET looks down and GENIE below.)

GENIE: How is our friend?

(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.)

ALADDIN: Good cat, take it away. Kitten down. (He leaves
        his turban to banish RAJAH.)
JASMINE: (She looks at him, thinking she sees him)
        before.) Wait, wait. I know you?
ALADDIN: (changing his turban quickly) No, no.
JASMINE: You remind me of a person I met at the market.
ALADDIN: The market? (A bee buzzes around his head.)
        I have servants who go to the market for me.
        Why do I have servants who go to the market?
        to my servants, so it couldn't be me you
        face.
JASMINE: (Looks disappointed.) No, I guess not.
BEE: (It's NERO) Enough of you, Casanova. Talk
        about him! He's smart, funny, hair, eyes.
        Whatever: choose a feature!
ALADDIN: Oh, Princess Jasmine? You are very...
BEE: Lovely, great, wonderful, spot on!
ALADDIN: Exactly!
JASMINE: Punctual?
BEE: Sorry.
ALADDIN: Great.
BEE: Nice improvement.
JASMINE: Hmm. I'm rich too, you know.
ALADDIN: Yeah!
JASMINE: Daughter of the Sultan
ALADDIN: I know.
JASMINE: A great price for any prince to marry.
ALADDIN: That is true. PROPERLY. A prince like me.
BEE: (whispers in his ear) Watch out! Warning!
JASMINE: That's right, a prince like you. And all the other sweatshirts,
             proud, the peacock I met!
BEE: (On fire again, glasses on and falls) Mayday!
              Cars!
JASMINE: Go jump off the balcony! (He turns and walks away)
ALADDIN: What?
BEE: Stop him! Stop him! Do you want me to poke him?
ALADDIN: (He hits the bee) Off!
BEE: Okay, great. But remember: be yourself! (The bee buzzes
             his turban)
ALADDIN: Yeah, it's true!
JASMINE: What!?!
ALADDIN: Er, you're right. You are not just a prize for being
        won. (He looks disappointed.) You should be free
        make your own choice. (JASMINE and RAJAH look
        look at each other confused.) I'm going now. (He
        climb to the edge and climb down.)
JASMINE: No!
ALADDIN: (poking his head over the edge) What? What?
JASMINE: (Now she's surprised) How -- how do you do that?
        (He looks over the edge and sees a CARPET.)
ALADDIN: It's a flying carpet.
JASMINE: That's wonderful. (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand a
        glans.)
ALADDIN: You, uh, don't want a ride, do you?
        We could leave the palace and see the world.
JASMINE: Is it safe?
ALADDIN: Of course. Do you trust me?
JASMINE: (She looks at him as she says all this...
        important line) What?
ALADDIN: (Extends his hand as before) Do you trust
        I?
JASMINE: (she smiles) Yes.

(He takes her hand and climbs onto the CARPET. He zooms into the sky,
    put both in a sitting position. Music "A Whole
     A new world" swells. JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH watching
    looked at him questioningly. He gasps as they fly over the palace
     on the wall and in the sky.)

ALADDIN: I can show you the world
    Brilliant, glittering, magnificent.
    Tell me, princess, when was the last time you visited
    Let your heart decide?

(CARPET zooms through town, pausing briefly to choose a
    flower. He gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.
      He smiles.)

    I can open my eyes
    Marvel at the miracle
    Above, side and below
    On a flying carpet


(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings and then zooms into the clouds.)

    A whole new world!
    A great new perspective
    No one tells us no
    Or where to go
    Or suppose we are only dreaming

(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from view. WORM
    fly in and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE: A whole new world
    A dazzling place I have never known
    But when I'm up there
    It's crystal clear
    That now I'm in a whole new world with you!

ALADDIN: Now I'm with you in a whole new world!

(They both get a small cloud as CARPET continues to fly. He
    then rotates the cloud statue, making it appear swirly.)

JASMINE: amazing performances
    An unspeakable feeling
    Hovering, spinning, spinning freely
    Through the endless diamond sky

(They join the flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks horrified.
    and shouts. MATTO does somersaults and somersaults, sometimes falls
    ALADDIN and JASMINE in free fall, but catch them. They
    zoom above the clouds where the starry night awaits.)

JASMINE: A whole new world!
ALADDIN: Don't you dare close your eyes
JASMINE: A hundred thousand things to see
ALADDIN: Hold your breath, it'll get better!
JASMINE: I'm like a shooting star,
    I have come this far
    I can't go back to where I was!

(They fly over a river, apparently the Nile, because behind it
     the ship's sails are large pyramids. They greet the employee
     carve the entire nose of the sphinx. He smiles, but
    chisel too much and break the front of the nose.)

ALADDIN: A Whole New World!
JASMINE: Every twist is a surprise
ALADDIN: New horizons to pursue
JASMINE: Any minute, red letter

(They fly alongside the running wild horses. JASMINE caresses one of them.)

BOTH: I'll chase them anywhere
    There is time to waste
    Let me share this whole new world with you

    A whole new world
    This is where we will be

(They cross Greece, where ALADDIN grabs the apple a
    tree and rolls it with his arm towards JASMINE who is now safe
    he's dealing with ALADDIN, not Prince ALI.)

ALADDIN: The Thrilling Chase
JASMINE: Great place
BOTH: For you and me!

(A CARPET floats above the lake, and we see a reflection
    the moon in the lake. Fireworks explode and we see a couple
    during the Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on the roof.)

JASMINE: It's so magical.
ALADDIN: Yeah.
JASMINE: (She looks at him and decides to break the bubble)
        Too bad Abu had to miss this one.
ALADDIN: No. He hates fireworks. (TAPIT raises his head
        realizes what's going on.) He certainly doesn't
        like flying. (And now ALADDIN realizes it)
        It's... oh no!
JASMINE: (she takes off her turban) You're a boy
        walk! I knew it. Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I'm sorry.
JASMINE: Did you think I was stupid?
ALADDIN: No!
JASMINE: I wouldn't understand?
ALADDIN: No. I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't. It is not
        what i wanted to say.
JASMIN: Who are you? Tell the truth!
ALADDIN: The truth? (He looks at the WORM, who motioned to him,
        abandon all hope.) Truth...truth is...me
        sometimes dressing plain to escape
        the pressures of palace life. (MATTO IS TRUSTED
        defeat.) But I really am a prince! (Pen on
         his turban falls over his eyes.)
JASMINE: Why didn't you tell me?
ALADDIN: Well, you know, uh... the royal goes
        the city in disguise, it looks a little strange,
        you do not believe?
JASMINE: Not so weird.

(She picks up a feather and snuggles up against him. THE WORM puts on a
    pom pom under his "chin" and looks like a mystery. Dissolve outwards.
    from the palace balcony where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. CARPET
    forms a staircase and it goes down. ALADDIN then comes down
     right under the balcony.)

JASMINE: Good night, handsome prince.
ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but MATO bumps into him and they
    kiss earlier than expected. He slowly walks away, then turns around and
    Look at him. Finally, he enters her room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN: Yes! (He falls back onto the CARPET, which lands
        on the ground.) For the first time in my life
        things are starting to go well.

(He looks up at JASMINE's balcony and four pairs of hands grab him.)

ALADDIN: Hello! What? (A diaper is tied around his mouth.
        Muffled words) Abu! Abu! (We see an elephant
        suspended from a net attached to a tree.)
WARNING: Hold the tail!

(Chains are placed on his feet and hands. Another RULER binds
    CARPET knotted around the tree.)

JAFAR: I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince
        Aboubou. (He walks away.) Make sure he is
        was never found.

(A GUARD hits him on the head and he falls unconscious. Cut to a
    on the cliff where the RULES laugh as ALADDIN's body falls into the water.
      He is now conscious, but his leg is tied to a rock. Rock
     osuu meren pohjaan, sitten turbaani laskeutuu ja lamppu putoaa
    ulos. Hän näkee tämän ja yrittää hieroa lamppua. Kuitenkin hän
    menettää tajuntansa ja kaatuu maahan. Lamppu, epävakaa
    liikkeellään pyörii ja hankaa käsiään. Se vapisee,
    ja GENIUS tulee esiin kylpyharjan, kumiankan ja suihkumyssyn kanssa)

GENIUS: Älä koskaan epäonnistu. Käy kylvyssä ja se on kitkaa
        lamppu. (ankka vinkua) Hei. (katso
        ALADDIN tajuton) Al? Al! Lapsi, lopeta!
        Et voi huijata tätä! En voi auttaa sinua
        ellet tee toivetta. Sinun täytyy sanoa "Nero, minä
        I want you to save my life." Got it? Okay. Come on
        Aladdin!! (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and
        shake him. His head rises and then falls.) Me
        take it yes. (The head turns into a mermaid.)
        Wow! Wow! (Turns into a submarine.)
        scope! (He laughs something that sounds
        German. A giant water nozzle on the surface
        emerges and lands on a rock. ALADDIN
        wakes up and coughs water from his lungs.)
        Don't scare me like that!
ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh... (He doesn't know how to say
        then they kiss.) Thanks, Genie.
GENIE: Oh Al. I'm starting to like you, boy. No
        that I want to choose curtains or something.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing off
   her hair. SULTAN appears in one of the double doors, hypnotized.)

SULTANI: Jasmine!
JASMINE: Oh, Dad, I just had the most amazing time.
        I am so happy.
SULTAN: (Still monotonous from hypnosis) You should be,
        Jasmine. I chose a man for you.
JASMINE: What?
SULTAN: (Another door opens to reveal JAFAR.) You will
        to marry Jafar.

(JASMINE gasps at the sight.)

JAFAR: You're speechless, I see. Excellent quality a
        hate
JASMINE: I will never marry you. (He goes to SULTAN)
        Dad, I choose Prince Ali!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is gone!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in front of the balcony door.)

ALADDIN: You better check your crystal ball again, Jafar!
JASMINE: Prince Ali!

(JAFAR gasps when he sees ALADDIN.)

IAGO: How the hell... (back to the parrot)... uh, awk!
ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar! You tried to get me
        kill.
JAFAR: What? (He goes to SULTAN) Ridiculous
        This is absurd, Your Highness. He is clearly lying.
        (He brings the stick closer to SULTAN's face.)
SULTAN: Apparently... lying.

(ALADDIN sees the wand with his glowing eyes.)

JASMINE: Dad, what's wrong with you?
ALADDIN: I know!

(ALADDIN grabs the stick and slams it on the ground. JAFAR jumps.
    and the spell was broken for good.)

SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh, my God!
ALADDIN: Your highness, Jafar rules over you
        This! (He brings the stick forward)
SULTAN: What? Jafar? You traitor!

(The trio advances on JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
SULTAN: Guards! Guards!
IAGO: Well, that's all, we're dead, forget it. Only
        dig a grave for us both. They were dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket. He makes a move, but
    the guards grab.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.
JAFAR: It is not done yet, my son!

(JAFAR takes a bottle from his pocket. ALADDIN sees him and rushes
    him, but JAFAR throws the bottle on the ground. A big red cloud
    will appear. When he's gone, so is JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find it, search everywhere!
ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you okay?
JASMINE: Yes.

(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTANI comes between them.)

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted adviser, is plotting back
        me all this time. Simply awful. How could I ever -
        (He stops mid-sentence and looks at the two men.)
        Could this be true? My daughter ended up choosing one
        suitor? (He nods) Ha ha! Praise Allah! You
        great boy i could kiss you! I won't - I will
        leave it to me.... You're getting married at the same time!
        Yes Yes. And you will be happy and prosperous, and
        then my son, you will be my sultan!
ALADDIN: The Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, a brave honest young man like you, a
        a person of impeccable moral character
        just what this kingdom needs! (ALADDIN shows
        worried about this.)

(Cut to JAFAR's apartments. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO: We must get out of here! We have to get... I have to
        Start packing, Your Highness. Only essentials.
        (IAGO starts throwing things out of the cage.
        JAFAR smiles broadly.) Travel light! Bring him
        guns, guns, knives (stops and goes
        photo of him and JAFAR) and what
        This picture? I don't know - I think I'll make one
        strange face there. (JAFAR starts laughing wildly)
        Oh boy, has she gone crazy. It's broken. (IAGO
        flies at him and hits his head.) Jafar?
        Jafar? Pull yourself together, Jafar! (JAFAR gets it everywhere
        neck) Good grip!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing but this child in rags
        Aladdin. He has a lamp, Iago.
IAGO: Why is it wretched...
JAFAR: But you can get away with it!
Iago: Me?

(Cut to outside the palace. ALADDIN looks at the gardens.)

ALADDIN: The Sultan? They want me to be their sultan?

(GENIE comes out of the lamp)

GENIE: Huzzah! Hail to the conqueror! (Changes
        a one man band. He sees ALADDIN walking away with him
        head down. He stops, scratches his head, arrives
        with the idea and then zoom to ALADDIN. He has
        he raises his hand like a director framing a film and
        we'll go through them.) Aladdin, you just won
        princess heart What are you going to do
        to follow? (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away
        sadness in bed where he collapses on it and sighs.
        GENIE is confused again, then goes up to him and shoots
        script called "Aladdin". Whisper :)
        Psst, your phrase is "liberate genien".
        Whenever.
ALADDIN: Genius... I can't.
GENIE: Of course you can. You just say “Genius, I wish you
        free." (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses
        him as a simulated ventriloquist puppet. ALADDIN walks away.)
ALADDIN: I'm serious. I'm sorry, I really am. But
        they want to make me sultan - no!, they want to make me
        Prince Ali Sultan. Without you I'm just Aladdin.
GENIE: Al, you win!
ALADDIN: Because of you! The only reason people think I am
        it's all because of you. And if they find out
        Am I really not a prince? (Calmly) What if
        Jasmine finds out? I'm losing it. Genius, I can't
        keep it to myself. I cannot wish you freedom.
GENIE: (Sarcastic) Hey, I see. However,
        you lied to everyone. Hi, I started
        Feel left out. Now if you'll excuse me,
        control. (He then says the last word disgustingly
        beanbags return to the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET watch from the window.)

ABU: Ohhoh.
ALADDIN: Genie, I'm so sorry. (The language comes out
        beak and raspberries for him.) Well, very good. (He clicks
        pillow over the LAMP.) So just stay inside
        there! (He looks at ABU and MATO.) What are you doing?
        are the guys watching? (They both leave.) Look, it's me
        Sorry. Wait, Abu... wait... Sorry, I don't...
        wait come on (He sighs.) What do I do?
        Genie is right: I have to tell Jasmine the truth.
JASMINE: (from a distance) Ali, oh Ali, are you coming here?
ALADDIN: (puts on turban) Well then. (He walks
        in the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?

(We see IAGO dressed in a cape and standing on wooden splits next to FLAMINGO
    in the pond. He imitates JASMINE's voice.)

IAGO: Huh... In the Menager, make haste.
ALADDIN: I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds. IAGO laughs,
    then turns around and looks at FLAMINGO's face, which is
    pant.)

FLAMINGO: Uh!
IAGO: Got a problem, pinky? (He sweeps the bird away
        legs out from under. IAGO runs to the palace
        and finds a lamp under the pillow.) Boy, Jafarin
        I'm glad to see you! (he stretches his face
        like JAFAR and imitates it.) Good job, Iago!
        (Normal) Ah, go on. (JAFAR) No, really, to scale
        from one to ten, you are eleven! (Normal) Ah,
        Jafar, you are so kind. I'm ashamed, I am
        blush. (She flies away with the lamp.)

(Cut to palace entrance. The SULTAN stands at the top and does
    notice to people.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a
        cossie!

(Cut behind curtain to where JASMINE is looking. ALADDIN
    can be seen at the bottom of the stairs.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine?
JASMINE: Ali, where have you been?
ALADDIN: I have something to tell you.
JASMINE: The whole kingdom turned to the father
        ad!
ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me!
JASMINE: Good luck! (She pushes him onto the stage
        With SULTAN, where it sees the whole
        crowd.)
SULTAIN: ...He's a Dog!
ALADDIN: Oh, my son!

(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR look through the window.)

IAGO: Look at them, they applaud the little whiner.
JAFAR: Let them clap.

 (He picks up the lamp and rubs it. THE GENIUS comes out.)

GENIUS: You know Al, I get it (turns around and sees JAFAR)
        really yyyyy -- I don't think you're him. (He
        goes down and asks for the poster.) Tonight
        The role of Ali is played by tall, dark and
        dark ugly man.
JAFAR: I am your master now. (He throws GENIUS
        on the ground and places his foot on the face of GENIUS.)
GENIE: I was afraid of it.
JAFAR: Genie, grant me my first wish. I would like to decide
        on high, as a sultan!!!

(Cut to where dark clouds surround the castle. The castle shakes.
    The roof is torn apart and SULTAN and ALADDIN shoot each other.)

ALADDIN: Wow!
SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What is happening?

(His turban takes off his head. When he grabs it, his whole body
    fly away and then take off all their clothes except for their boxers
     shorts. The clothes reappear in JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Hey hey hey!
SULTAN: Jafar, you vile traitor.
IAGO: To you it is Sultan Vile Betrayer.
ALADDIN: Oh, right? Well, we'll see! (animated
        takes off his own turban, but finds it empty) Lamp!
JAFAR: Finders-keepers, Abooboo.

(They both look up and see a giant GENIUS bearing down on the palace
    clouds... ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies off to greet him.
      They fly near GENI's head.)

ALADDIN: Genius! No!
GENIE: Sorry, son, I've got a new master now. (He sets
        a palace on top of a mountain.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I command you to stop!
JAFAR: Now there's a new order: my order! Finally, you
        bow me down!

(SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)

JAFAR: We will never bow to you!
IAGO: Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR: If you don't bow to the Sultan, you will
        bow before the wizard! (TO GENIUS) Genius, mine
        second wish - I want to be the most efficient
        wizard of the world!

(GENIE holds out his finger. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he can't,
    and another GENIE(tm) character's lightning strikes JAFAR,
     to return it to its normal appearance.)

IAGO: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Agrabah
        Old Jafar!
JAFAR: Now where were we? Ah yes, a terrible humiliation!
        (She scratches JASMINE and SULTAN with a stick, and
        both bow before him. RAJAH rushes towards him.
        He hits RAJAH and the tiger turns into a kitten.
        cat.) Down, my son! Oh princess... (raises her chin
        with his team) - is someone I would die for
        you perform.
ALADDIN: (off camera) Jafar! Do not touch her!

(JAFAR robs ALADDIN. THE WORM flies away.)

JAFAR: Prince Ali
    yes it's him
    But not as you know it.
    Read my lips and understand
    With reality

(JAFAR brings them both together in the air.)

    Yes, meet a blast from your past
    Whose lies were too good to last
    Say hello to precious Prince Ali!

(JAFAR brings ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO: Or should we say Aladdin?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I tried to tell you.

JAFAR: So Ali just turns out to be Aladdin
    Just a scam, should I continue?
    Believe me
    His personality flaw
    Give me a good enough reason
    Sending him packing on a one-way ticket
    So his future prospects go down for good
    His assets frozen, location chosen
    It's the end of the world, oops!
    Goodbye,
IAGO: Farewell, see you soon!
JAFAR: The former Prince Ali!

(JAFAR has restored ABU to normal. He sends them both to
    large pillar, then launch it like a rocket, but not before
    MATO gets in. F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where
    the pillar topples and falls. Eventually it stops.
    ALADDIN emerges, visibly very cold.)

ALADDIN: Abu? Abu! (He looks at the shaking pile
        snow.) Oh, this is all my fault - I should have
        I unleashed my genes when I had the chance. (He digs
        takes out ABU and rocks him in his vest.) Abu!
        Do you agree? I'm sorry Abu, I messed up
        everything, one way or another. I have to go back and settle down
        things are good. (He starts walking in the snow,
        and he ends up walking on a frozen CARPET.)
        Carpet! (He looks up and sees that the CARPET is attached
        pillar. He shoots to try and free the CARPET. He
        can't do that, so he starts shoveling snow
        base of the pillar.) Abu, start digging! it is
        he! (The snow has finally been plowed enough and
        the pillar starts spinning. ALADDIN escapes,
        looks back and then settles down. Pillar
        turns to him, and when he is gone, ALADDIN and
        ABU is left to sit in the layer of snow he created
        pillar window.) Yeah! Clear! (He
        looks up at his turban made in fear of ABU.
        MATTO shakes off the snow and rushes to collect
        pick them up.) Now, let's get back to Agrabah! Let's go!

(We return to a long shot of Agrabah, covered in red clouds.
    Cut int. and the slow zoom of the throne room. IAGO TO THE SULTAN
    bound like a doll, and JASMINE is chained beside
    to the throne.)

IAGO: The puppet master wants some biscuits? Here are your cookies.
        Shove them all down your throat. Here is
        a lot !

(JAFAR pulls the chain and JASMINE approaches him holding an apple.)

JAFAR: Leave him alone!

(IAGO pauses for a moment, then continues.)

JAFAR: It pains me to see you become this, Jasmine.
        (She bites the apple he is holding.)
        A beautiful desert flower, as you should be
        on the arm of the greatest man in the world.
        (He waves his finger and the crown appears.) What are you doing?
        you say honey Why, when you're the queen...

(She takes a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)

JASMINE: Never!
JAFAR: I'm going to teach you respect! (He falls back as he
        raises his hand to strike him. Then he stops.) No.
        Genius, I decided to make my last wish. I
        i hope princess jasmine falls desperately
        love with me

(We see ALADDIN running back into town.)

GENIE: (again in Buckley form) Ah, master... there are a few
        additions, notes
JAFAR: Don't answer me, you stupid blue bastard! You
        I'll do what I tell you to do, slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window waving at her
    play at the same time.)

JASMINE: (She gets up and puts the crown on her head.)
        Jafar! I never realized how amazing it was
        you are beautiful.

(NERO's jaw drops.)

JAFAR: That's better. (He lifts the chin of GENIUS like a
        shadow.) Now, kitty, tell me more
        about me.
JASMINE: You are tall, well dressed...

(JAFAR approaches him. ALADDIN jumps with ABU and GENI
    can see them.)

GENIE: Al! Al, little friend!
ALADDIN: Shh!
GENIE: (Literally closes her mouth and then opens it.)
        Al, I can't help you. I work for a psychopath.
        NOW. (His head transforms into JAFAR's and then returns.)
ALADDIN: Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? (He rips GENI
        mouth.) I'm going to improvise.

(He slides a pile of coins and hides near JAFAR and JASMINE.
    JAFAR turns his back on ALADDIN.)

JAFAR: Jatka.
JASMINE: And your beard... is so... crooked! (He has it
        arm around him. He pretends to tour with her
        finger, but he's actually waving at ALADDIN
        Pending. He makes his move. IAGO sees it.)

IAGO: Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)
JAFAR: What about a street rat?
JASMINE: What street rat?

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over the bowl. JAFAR
    turns to look, but JASMINE catches and kisses him. ALADDIN
     looks disgusting. (Both IAGO and ABU look disgusted.)

ABU: Cheers!
JAFAR: It was... (he sees ALADDIN's reflection in him
        crown.) You!! How many times have I
        to kill you my son?

 (He robs ALADDIN. JASMINE rushes towards him and he throws her
    down. ALADDIN rushes and grabs the stick.)

ALADDIN: Get the lamp!

(JASMINE runs towards him. However, JAFAR then shakes ALADDIN
    put it in an hourglass.)

JAFAR: Ah, ah, ah, princess - Your time is up!

(Sand starts falling on him from above.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine!
IAGO: Oh, good move, Jaf... (He is knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU rushes towards the lamp.)

JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He turns into a toy monkey.
ALADDIN: Abu!


(TAPIT rushes.)

JAFAR: Things are moving fast now, son. (The CARPET is
        dismantled and repealed. ALADDIN rushes towards
        lamp.) Do you understand? (His path is blocked
        big swords stuck in the ground. JAFAR takes over
        lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a
        sword from the ground.) I'm just warming up
        up! (He spits the Ring of Fire around ALADDIN.)
ALADDIN: Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you coward
        snake?
JAFAR: Snake, right? Maybe you want to see how
        I can be like a snake! (He smiles widely, and we
        you see a snake's tongue sticking out from behind you
        teeth. He then transforms into a giant cobra and
        The ring of fire around ALADDIN is a part
        a snake surrounds ALADDIN. The snake that JAFAR makes
        moves to ALADDIN and on the third try to ALADDIN
        swings the sword and hits JAFAR. Cut GENIUS
        cheerleaders wearing A-line sweaters.)

GENIUS: Rickem, rockem, racem, rake - thrust that sword
        this snake!
JAFAR: Stay out of it!

(GENIE waves a small pennant with a "J" on it.)

GENIUS: (weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man - if he can't,
        GLORIOUS!

(ALADDIN takes advantage of the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where
    JASMINE is trapped. However, JAFAR sees him and blocks the path.
     ALADDIN is thrown and loses his sword.)

JASMINE: Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps on a large jewel and slides along the ground, grasping it
    sword in the way. He turns the corner, but the snake that chases him
    can't, and JAFAR's front crashes through the wall and
    hangs outside the palace. ALADDIN jumps on the snake
     and stabs him. JAFAR screams in agony. ALADDIN tries again
     free the princess.)

ALADDIN: Wait, Jasmine!

(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR catches him.)

JAFAR: (laughs hideously) You little fool! You thought
        you can defeat the most powerful creature on the planet!
IAGO: (GENIUS coming up behind him) Squeeze him,
        Jafar – Squeeze it like – awk! (GENIE nudges him
        out of the way)
JAFAR: Without genius, my son, you are nothing!
ALADDIN: (on idea) Black! Black! Black
        have more power than you will ever have!
JAFAR: What!!
ALADDIN: He gave you your power, he can take it back from you!
GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why you bring me
        inside of it ?
ALADDIN: Admit it, Jafar: you're still just a stopgap!
JAFAR: You're right! His power surpasses mine! But
        not for a long while!

(JAFAR spins around the GENIUS.)

GENIUS: This boy is crazy. He's a little drunk. A
        too many strikes with the snake (hands
        turns into a snake and hits his head with it.)
JAFAR: Slave, I make my third wish! I want to be whole
        powerful genius!
GENIE: (reluctantly) Fine, your wish is my command.
        Well done, Al.

(GENIE outdoes JAFAR with the latest flash from the GENIE (tm) brand.
    JAFAR's snake form dissolves and he turns into a spirit. We
     watch JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand. ALADDIN
    runs and finally breaks the glass. Sand and the princess
     landfill.)

JAFAR: Yes! Yeah! Power! Absolute power!
JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What did you do?
ALADDIN: Believe me!

(A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base. JAFAR casts a spell.)

JAFAR: The universe is mine, I command it, I rule it!
ALADDIN: Not so fast, Jafar! Don't you forget something?
    (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genius, you
    I understood! And everything that goes with it!

(Chains appear on JAFAR's wrists.)

JAFAR: No! No!
IAGO: I'm leaving! Come on, you are
        genius, I don't want to...

(IAGO tries to fly away, but is caught by JAFAR.)

ALADDIN: Phenomenal Cosmic Powers! Very small living space.
GENIUS: Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU returns to normal, MATO rises to the surface, JASMINE, SULTAN
    and RAJAH are together. RAJAH jumps into his arms
     SULTANIA, then they all change. SULTAN has been crushed
     because of the weight of the new RAJAH. The palace reappears
     where he was in town. ALADDIN finds himself holding
    new bulb.)

JAFAR: (both from inside the lamp.) Take your beak.
        out of my face!
IAGO: Oh, shut up, you idiot!
JAFAR: Don't tell me to shut up!
GENIE: Let me. (He takes the lamp and goes over
        balcony. He is now wearing a baseball cap. He
        ends as if to throw away the lamp, but opens it
        flattens the palm and throws it into the desert
        with his finger.) Ten thousand years in the cave
        miracles should relax him!

(JAFAR and IAGO continue arguing as they disappear. JASMINE walks.
    to ALADDIN. They are holding hands, but both look sad.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a
        prince.
JASMINE: I know why you did it.
ALADDIN: Well, I guess... this is... goodbye? (GENIE pushes
        his head in the corner is shocked at what he is
        hearing.)
JASMINE: Oh this stupid law. It's not fair, I love you.
GENIE: (wipes a tear) Al, it's okay. You still have
        I have one wish left. Just say the word and you're one
        the prince again.
ALADDIN: But Genie, what about your freedom?
GENIE: Hey, it's just an eternity of slavery. it is
        love. (He leans next to her.) Al, you are
        I can't find another girl like her in a million
        years. Believe me, I know. I looked.
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I love you, but I have to stop
        pretending to be something I'm not.
JASMINE: I see.

(They look into each other's eyes for the last time, then ALADDIN turns
    for ENGINEERING.)

ALADDIN: Genie, I desire your freedom.
GENIUS: A true pedigree of a future prince. What I ?
ALADDIN: (He holds out the lamp to the GENIUS.) Genius, you are
        free!

(A transformation scene follows where the chains fall
    GENI'S wrist and lamp fall to the ground in vain.
     GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)

GENIE: (He can't believe it.) Hey, hey! I am free. I am
        free. (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.) Quick,
        quickly, hope for something extraordinary. Say “I want
        Nile. » I wish Niili. Try this!
ALADDIN: I hope for the Nile.
GENIE: No way!! (Laughs hysterically. He bounces
        on the balcony like a pinball machine.) Oh, Does it feel like it
        GOOD! I am free! I'm finally free! i hit
        road. I'm going to explore the world! I--

(She packs her suitcase, but looks down to see ALADDIN watching
    very sad.)

ALADDIN: Genie, I'll miss you.
GENIE: Me too, Al. No matter what anyone says, you do it
        always be a prince to me.

(They kiss. The SULTAN comes forward.)

SULTAN: That's true. You have certainly proven your worth
        what comes to me. This law is what it is
        problem.
JASMINE: Dad?
SULTAN: Well, am I a Sultan or am I a Sultan? From this day on
        from now on, the princess will marry whomever she judges
        worth.
JASMINE: (She smiles broadly and runs into ALADDIN's arms.)
        Him! I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.
ALADDIN: Ha, ha. Call me Al.

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands bring everyone together.
    GENIE is wearing a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and Goofy
     hat.)

GENIE: Oh, all of you. Come here. Big group hug!
        Do you mind if I kiss a monkey? (She kisses ABU.) Ooh,
        hairball! Well, I can't do any more damage here
        this ice cream stand. I'm leaving! Bye,
        you two crazy lovebirds. Hello, Rugman: ciao! I am
        history! No, I'm mythology! No, I don't care
        what am i, i am free!

(GENIUS flies into the blue sky, leaving a trail of sparks
    behind him. They cut (the jump makes things worse)
     to the fireworks that explode over the night landscape. We bow down and see
     ALADDIN and JASMINE fly on a CARPET.)

ALADDIN: A Whole New World
JASMINE: A whole new life
BOTH: (in off-camera chorus) For you and me!
MALE CHOIR: A whole new world!

(They fly away in the moonlight and lost,
    the moon turns to reveal NERO's laughing face. Suddenly
    the film is caught "out of the projector", GENIUS picks it up
     and looks at the audience.)

GENIUS: I made you watch!

(Returns movie to normal, moon to normal. Fade to black.
    End.)

[Fade to black. A Hip of crimson mist before a wall of red flames.
The fog is formed in golden letters: "Aladdin". The letters sparkle and then fly away.
In the desert, a small merchant rides a camel and sings in the quiet night as the opening credits roll.]

Peddler:

♪ Oh, I'm from a land, a far away place ♪

♪ Where the camels of the caravan roam ♪

♪ Where they cut your ears off if they don't like your face ♪ / ♪ Where it's flat and huge and the heat is fierce ♪

♪ It's barbaric, but hey, it's home! ♪

♪ When the wind comes from the east and the sun from the west and sand in the glass is just right ♪

♪ Get off, stop, jump on the carpet and fly to another Arabian night! ♪

[Above the dunes we are shown the city of Agrabah. The castle absolutely dominates the view, while the merchant sings as he approaches the city border.]

Peddler:

♪ Arabian nights like Arabian days ♪

♪ More often than not, it's hotter than hot ♪

♪ In many ways! ♪

[The camera pans to a city street where the fire eater is doing his deed. It spits flames, which brings us back to the merchant.]

♪ A thousand and one nights, under the Arabian moons ♪

♪ Stupid, unprepared, can fall and crash hard ♪

♪ On that dune ♪

[A tired camel, panting and trembling on its four legs, falls and its driver slides nimbly on his back.
He shakes hands as he speaks to the viewer(s)]

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. (greeting) Please come closer.

[The camera zooms in and presses itself against the merchant's face]

Peddler: (unpleasantly) Ugh... Too close. A little too close.

[Fortunately for all involved, the camera is pulled back a bit]

Peddler: Ah, there. Welcome to Agrabah... (lights the flame) City of Mysteries... (squeezing the camel's head) Enchanting...

[He opens the bag on the camel's back, which suddenly transforms into a fully decorated bazaar stall.]

Peddler: And the best stuff this side of Jordan, on sale today. Get lost. Uh huh.

[He takes out a rather conspicuous vase from the top of the stall.]

Peddler: Look at it. Yeah. Hookah and coffee maker combination. (by pressing it against the potato) You can also make julienne potatoes. No offense.
(Slams him on the table) There won't be…

[Boo! Top comes off.]

Pedlar: (expressionless) It broke. (throws it aside) Oops! Look at this. (takes the box) I've never seen one intact before.
This is the famous Tupperware from the Dead Sea. Listen...

[She opens it and blows a raspberry out for effect]

Peddler: Ah, that's always good.

[Now it's clear: we're not interested. The camera begins to pan away from the merchant, who is hastily trying to catch up with us.]

Merchant: (waves his hands) Wait, don't go! (smiling) I see that you are only interested in what is exceptionally rare.
I think then you would be well rewarded for considering... this.

[The merchant now takes the iconic magic lamp from his sleeve and holds it tenderly in his hands.]

Pedlar: Don't let his simple appearance fool you. As with many other things, it's not what's on the outside that counts, it's what's on the inside.

[Camera pans again. However, the merchant does not give up and struggles once again to stay in the sight of his potential buyers]

Pedlar: (distressed) This is no ordinary lamp! It changed the young man's life.
The young man who loved this lamp was more than what he seemed. (looks around, whispering) Diamond in the rough. (smiling)
Maybe you'd like to hear a story?

[The merchant pours shiny sand from the lamp into his hand...]

Pedlar: It begins in the dark night...

[...and throws it into the sky, where it forms a starry nightscape.]

Peddler (vo): Where the dark man waits... with a dark purpose...

(The camera pans to an open desert where Jafar waits above a mountain of sand atop a horse.
His companion, a parrot named Iago, is still perched on his shoulder, while a rather disheveled man walks towards them from the shadows.
Newcomer Gazeem dismounts and admires the two.]

Jafar: You're late.

Gazeem: (bowing) So sorry, oh patient one.

Jafar: Do you have it then?

Gazeem: I had to cut a few throats, but I made it.

[He takes out a locket: half of a gold beetle. Jafar reaches out to get it, but Gazeem pulls it away]

Gazeem: Ah-ah-ahhh. (Holds out his free hand) Treasure.

[Iago shouts as he passes and grabs the locket]

Gazeem: Ouch!

Jafar: Trust me, my prickly friend. You get what comes to you.

Iago: What ails you? Ouch!

(Jafar takes out the other half of the locket. He joins them to form a golden beetle. It comes to life and flies away.)

Jafar: Quick! Follow the path!

(On horseback, the trio chases the locket across the moonlit desert)

Jafar: Faster!

[The creature splits in half and both lie in a sand dune. An impressive tiger head rises from the dune.
The beetle's pieces make up its glowing eyes. Men's horses rear up on their hind legs and topple their riders.
Jafar smiles as the tiger head opens its hollow mouth]

[horse neighs]

[howling wind]

Jafar: Finally, after all the years of searching... The Cave of Wonders.

Iago: Awk. Cave of Wonders!

Gazeem: (whispering) By Allah...

Jafar: Now remember. Bring me the lamp! The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp... is mine. [laugh]

(Gazeem begins to approach the lion's mouth, which is the entrance to the cave. He laughs as he walks away.)

Iago: Oh lamp. Oh, the lamp. (Now that Iago and Jafar are alone, Iago opens up in normal English.) Damn it, where did you find that bozo?

(Jafar puts his finger to his lips and silences him. Gazeem crawls towards the mouth entrance of the cave.
He looks inside his mouth as his tongue turns into a staircase.
He dribbles around one of the tiger's teeth, but is startled by the roar of the cave's words.)

Cave: [echoing growl] Who's disturbing my sleep?

Gazeem: [the thief hatches] It's me, Gazeem, the humble thief.

Cave: Know this. Only one can come here. The one whose value is far away. A diamond in the rough.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look.)

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Jack.

[beast sighs]

(Gazeem hesitates and then steps into the cave with one foot. With great fear, he lowers his foot. Nothing happens.
Relieved, he continues his journey. Then comes another scream. He turns around, but the lion's mouth closes and the dune returns to normal.
All that remains is Jafar, Iago, and the two separate halves of the locket.)

Jafar: NOOOOO!

Cave: Find... a diamond in the rough...

Iago: [coughs] I can't believe it. I just don't believe it! We'll never get our hands on that stupid lamp!
Forget it! Look at this. Look at this. I'm so tickled I'm peeing. (She flies onto Jafar's shoulder.)

Jafar: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem apparently wasn't worth it.

Iago: (very sarcastic) Oh, there's a big surprise. It's unbelievable... I think I'm going to have a heart attack and die from this surprise.
What are we going to do? We have a big problem here, a big…

[Jafar pinches his beak]

Jafar: Yes. Only one can enter. I need to find this, this... diamond in the rough.

(Cut to the ceiling where Aladdin rushes to the edge carrying the bread. He almost drops it over the edge.)

Razoul: Stop! Thief! I'll take the trophy from you, street rat!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.) All this for bread? Oooooh!

(He jumps and lands on two ropes strung between buildings, and the clothes dry.
He looks at them and picks up clothes for himself as he goes.
Finally he approaches the end of the rope by the window as she reaches out and closes the shutters.
Aladdin hits the shutters and falls to the street. Numerous awnings and a pile of clothes around him break his fall.
He takes off the first layer of clothes and is about to eat his bread when...)

Guard 1: There he is!

Guard 2: You won't get through this easily!

Aladdin: Did you think it was easy?

(She looks at the three women and mocks them.)

Razoul: You two, this way, and you, follow me. We will find him.

(Aladdin puts a sheet over himself and wraps himself up to disguise himself. He rushes towards the women.)

Aladdin: Hello, ladies.

Woman 1: We're in trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?

Aladdin: Problem? Not at all. You'll only get in trouble if you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin's shoulder and pulls him back. It's Razoul. Aladdin's mask falls off.)

Razoul: I got you!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (Abu shouts, then the guard's turban is lowered over his eyes. Abu points to the guard's head, laughing.)

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Ash: Hey.

Aladdin: Come on. Let's get out of here. i have to keep...

(The guard swings at Aladdin, but destroys the fish barrel. Abu waddles at the guard, then dodges the attack. Aladdin then pulls down the guard's pants)

♪ One jump before the finish line ♪

♪ A step ahead of the sword ♪

♪ I only steal what I can't afford ♪ That's all.

(Aladdin runs away, the guard gives the fish over the lower body like pants.)

♪ One step ahead of the law ♪

♪ That's it, and it's no joke ♪

♪ These guys don't like that I'm broke! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu run over a stack of barrels and then hit the guards.)

Guards: (one at a time) ♪ Riffraff! ♪

♪ Street rat! ♪

♪ Cheater! ♪

(throws fruit to Aladdin) ♪ Take it! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Just a little snack, guys. ♪

Guards: ♪ Tear it up, take it back, guys! ♪

(Aladdin runs to the top of the stage. The guards shake the stage back and forth to try to make him fall.)

Aladdin: ♪ I see ♪

♪ I have to face the facts ♪

(Aladdin leaps from the stage to his certain death only to grab Abu's hands like an acrobat. The pair sway in the harem.)

♪ You're my only friend, Abu! ♪

Harem Girls: Who?

♪ Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom ♪

(Abou finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth like a chipmunk.)

♪ He became single to increase crime ♪

Woman 2: ♪ I'd blame the parents, but she doesn't have them. ♪

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live, ♪

♪ I must steal to eat ♪

♪ I'll tell you all about it when I have time! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu come out and bounce on the awning. Cut to a muscular man leaning into the crowd. The guards rush in.
Cut to Aladdin and Abu following the muscle man as he moves until they make a mistake and are spotted. )

♪ Jump ahead of slow kicks. ♪

♪ One step before my loss. ♪

♪ Next time I'll use a pen name. ♪

Razoul: There he is!

(A sequence where Aladdin and Abu, chased by guards, run through a herd of sheep and hit an artist sleeping on a bed of nails.
[of course a very large guard descends on him])

Aladdin: ♪ Jump ahead of the murderers ♪

♪ A step ahead of the pack ♪

♪ I think I'll go for a walk in the neighborhood ♪

(Abou disguises himself with jewelry until the merchant finds him.)

Man 1: ♪ Stop, thief! ♪

Merchant 1: ♪ Vandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Abu! ♪

Woman 3: ♪ Scandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Don't be in too much of a hurry ♪

(Aladdin is surrounded by GUARDS in front of the door. The door opens and a tall, ugly woman enters)

Woman: ♪ I think it's pretty tasty though! ♪

(Aladdin stoops and puts his arm around the guard, acting as if they were all friends.)

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live, ♪

♪ I must steal to eat ♪

♪ Otherwise we'd get along just fine! ♪

Guards: WRONG!

(Guards jump on Aladdin, but get tangled up. Their paint slips into the pots)

Head Guard: Get him!

(Aladdin jumps on the artist who is walking harmlessly across the hot coals. The guards rush through the coals, jumping in pain as they burn their feet.
Aladdin and Abu encounter a sword swallower, after which Abu returns to take the sword from the swallower's mouth. (Abu walks towards the guards, who stop in fear.)

Guard: He has a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We all have swords!

(Guards draw their swords. Abu lowers his sword and runs away. Aladdin and Abu are surrounded again, guards coming from left and right.
(He jumps and climbs a costume stunt going on down the street as all the guards bump into each other.)

Aladdin: ♪ One jump before the hooves hit ♪

Guards: Vandal!

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the hump ♪

Guards: Street rat!

Aladdin: ♪ One turn before disaster ♪

Guards: Trickster!

Aladdin: ♪ They're fast, but I'm much faster ♪

Guards: Take it!

(The guards chase Aladdin up the stairs into the room. He grabs the rug...)

Aladdin: ♪ Alright, ♪

♪ You better get your hands on it ♪

♪ I wish you a safe landing, ♪

♪ All I have to do is jump! ♪

(..and jumps out the window like the carpet is magic.
The guards follow him out the window, but fall straight into the street,
and land on the fertilizer cart with the "Mad Hakim's Discount Fertilizer" sign. )

Guards: Cheers! Hey!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely and out of danger. Aladdin and Abu greet each other)

Aladdin: And now, esteemed effendi, we celebrate. Clear.

(Aladdin splits the bread in half and gives half to Abu, who begins to eat.
But Aladdin looks and sees two small children looking for food in the garbage.
The girl sees him, then drops her find and tries to hide. Aladdin looks solemnly at them, then at the bread, then at Abouta.)

Abu: Nam, nam! Voi ei.

(Abou eats a large piece of his food, but Aladdin gets up and walks towards the children. The girl pulls her brother back.)

Aladdin: [sighs] Here. Jack. Take it.

(The children laugh with delight. Abu tries to swallow his mouthful, then looks guilty. He walks towards the children and offers them his bread.
Joyfully, they patted him on the head.)

Abu: Ah, don't do that. Huh?

(ABU sees ALADDIN coming into the daylight where the parade is going on. ALADDIN looks over people's shoulders.
He sees PRINCE ACHMED riding a horse.)

PASSENGER 1: On the way to the palace, I guess.

BYSTANDER 2: Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is surprised when the two children run out of the alley. THE BOY runs in front of ACHMED's horse, startling him.)

ACHMED: Out of my way, brat!

(ACHMED raises his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN jumps in front of them and grabs the whip.)

ALADDIN: Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford good manners!

ACHMED: Oh, I'll teach you manners!

(ACHMED throws ALADDIN into a puddle of mud. The audience laughs at him.)

ALADDIN: Look at that, Abu. It's not every day you see a horse with two hindquarters!

(ACHMED stops and turns to ALADDIN.)

AHMED: Oh! You are a worthless street rat! You were born a street rat, you die a street rat and only your fleas cry for you.

(ALADDIN rushes to ACHMED, but the castle doors close in his face.)

ALADDIN: I am not useless. And I don't have fleas. Come on, Abu. Let's go home.

(ALADDIN drives home with a view, then returns to ABU for the night.)

ALADDIN: Riffraff, street rat. I don't buy it. If only they looked closer, would they see the poor boy? No father. They would find out, there is so much more to me.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal a magnificent palace.) One day, Abu, things will change.
We become rich, live in a palace and never have problems.

(Dissolve into the same shot during the day. Cut to the interior of the SULTAN's bedroom. The door opens and PRINCE ACHMED rushes in, missing the back of his trousers.)

ACHMED: I have never been so insulted.

SULTAN: Oh Prince Ahmed. You're not leaving that early, are you?

ACHMED: Good luck marrying her.

SULTAN: Oh Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! (The SULTAN goes to the garden to look for his daughter.
He finds her but is stopped by RAJAH, JASMINE's pet tiger. RAJAH has a piece of PRINCE ACHMED's underwear in his mouth.
SULTAN seizes the cloth and pulls it from RAJAH's mouth.) Confused, Rajah! This is why Prince Ahmed stormed off!

JASMINE: Oh dad. Rajah was just playing with him, wasn't he Rajah. (RAJAH walks over and lets JASMINE stroke and hug him.)
You're just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Ahmed, aren't you?
(He snuggles up to RAJAH, enjoying the moment, until he looks up at his angry father.) Ahem.

SULTAN: My dear, you must stop rejecting all the suitors who invite you. The law says...

BOTH: …must be married to a prince.

(They head towards the pigeon cage.)

SULTAN: Until your next birthday.

JASMINE: The law is wrong.

SULTAN: You only have three days left!

JASMINE: Dad, I hate this. (He takes the pigeon from the cage and caresses it.) If I marry, I want it to be for love.

SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this law. (She hands him the pigeon and he puts it back in the cage.)
I won't be here forever and I just want to make sure you are cared for and taken care of.

JASMINE: Try to understand. I've never done anything myself. (He rolls his finger in the water of the pond, stroking the fish.)
I never had real friends. (RAJAH looks at him and growls.) Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he goes back to sleep.)
I never even left the palace walls.

SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.

JASMINE: So maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore. (He splashes water.)

SULTAN: Oooohhh! Allah forbids you to have daughters!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a moment. JASMINE walks towards the pigeon cage and rips open the door. The birds fly away to freedom. She watches them leave.
Cut int. from SULTAN apartments.)

SULTAN: I don't know where he got it. His mother was not so picky. (A shadow falls on him. He looks up in surprise and sees JAFAR.)
Oh no. Ah, Jafar, my most trusted advisor. I desperately need your wisdom.

JAFAR: My life is only to serve you, my lord. (He bows.)

SULTAN: It's this suitor thing. Jasmine refuses to choose a man. I'm at the end of my thread.

IAGO: (in parrot voice) Awk! Roll head.

SULTAN: Ah, ha, ha. Have fun, pretty Polly! (He takes a biscuit from his pocket. IAGO looks horrified. Then the SULTAN puts it in Iago's mouth.
IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it. JAFAR and SULTANI both laugh.)

JAFAR: Your majesty must have a problem with stupid animals. (IAGO looks at him.) Now perhaps I can guess the solution of this difficult problem.

SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you.

JAFAR: Ah, but that would require the use of the Mystic Blue Diamond.

SULTAN: Oh, my ring? But it's been in the family for years.

JAFAR: We need to find a suitor for the princess. (JAFAR pronounces the word "princess" with stress on the second syllable "cess".
He swings his cobra-headed staff towards the SULTAN. The staff's eyes start to shine. The room darkens, JAFAR's voice slows down and deepens.
SULTAN's eyes hypnotize.) Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

SULTAN: Everything…will…go…well.

JAFAR: A diamond.

SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Everything you need is in order.

(SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns to normal as JAFAR removes the wand.)

JAFAR: You are very kind, Liege. Now run around and play with your little toys.

SULTAN: (Still hypnotized) Yes... it's going to be... pretty good.

(JAFAR and IAGO come out. We follow them. As they leave the room, the parrot spits out biscuits.)

IAGO: I can take no more! If I end up choking on another one of those disgusting moldy cookies… bam! Hit!

(JAFAR pulls a rope that reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)

JAFAR: Calm down, Iago.

IAGO: Then I seized his head. Hit! Hit!

JAFAR: (speaking of IAGO.) Soon I shall be Sultan, not this confused idiot.

IAGO: And then I shoved crackers down his throat! Haha!

(The couple enter the door and slam it. Diss. out into the garden at night. A dark figure walks in. We see it's JASMINE in disguise.
He reaches the palace wall and then starts to climb it. RAJAH pulls him from behind.)

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and live my life for me. I will miss you.
(He starts to climb again and is helped by RAJAH, who starts whining and complaining.) Goodbye!

(He disappears over the wall. Cuts daylight into the street. ALADDIN and ABU resume their trick. They are on the awning of the fruit stand.)

ALADDIN: Okay, Abu. Go!

(ABU dives overboard and looks at the OWNER.)

OWNER: (To crowd of owners) Try this, your taste buds will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and holds it, distracting him.)
Hey, get your paws off of it.

ABU: Blah blah blah!

OWNER: Well you. Get out of here you dirty monkey.

(He grabs the melon from ABU's hands. But in the foreground ALADDIN bends down and grabs another melon from the rack.)

ABU: Goodbye.

(He gets up. The OWNER brings the melon in front, where he places it on top of the pile. He looks confused, as if he had just done this.)

ALADDIN: Well done, Abu. Breakfast will be served.

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof open a melon and eat. We see JASMINE walking down the street.)

SHOP 1: Beautiful woman, buy a pot. There is no finer pot made of brass or silver.

MERCHANT 2: Sweet dates, sweet dates and figs! Sweet dates and pistachios!

SHOP 3: Should a woman wear a necklace? A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.

(He is enamored with the action, but is surprised by a fish being thrown in his face.)

SHOP 4: Fresh fish! We catch them, you buy them!

JASMINE: I don't think so. (He backs away, but runs into a fire eater, who is surprised to swallow his fire.) Sorry.
(She swallows, then spits fire out of her mouth. JASMINE is disgusted. She is happy and pats her belly. ALADDIN sees her, and a strange look comes over his face.) I'm really, really sorry.

ALADDIN: (He's obviously deeply in love with her.) Wow.

(He pulls his cloak over the Hood's head. ABU sees this and jumps on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's face.)

ABU: Ooh. Good morning? Good morning?

(JASMINE stops at a fruit stand and sees a homeless child looking for fruit. She picks one and gives it to him.)

JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here is. (The boy runs away.)

OWNER: You better be able to pay for it.

JASMINE: (Mystified) Liver?

OWNER: No one steals my cart.

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I do not have money.

OWNER: Thief.

JASMINE: Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can get them from the Sultan.

OWNER: Do you know what the punishment is for theft?

(She takes his hand and pins it to the table, intending to cut it.)

JASMINE: No, no, thank you.

(The sword falls, but is stopped by ALADDIN's hand.)

ALADDIN: Thank you, good sir. I'm so glad you found it. I'm looking for you everywhere.

JASMINE: (whispering) What are you doing?

ALADDIN: (whispering back) Play along.

OWNER: Do you know this girl?

ALADDIN: Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister. He's a little crazy. (She puts her finger around his ear. He is shocked. THE OWNER grabs him by the waistcoat.)

OWNER: He said he knew the Sultan.

ALADDIN: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU picks his pockets. He hears this, then rises. JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)

JASMINE: Oh wise Sultan. How can I serve you?

ABU: No, blah blah blah.

ALADDIN: Tragic, isn't it? (He leans forward and picks up another apple from the cart with his foot.)
But no harm is done. (He walks towards Jasmine.) Come on, sister. It's time to go to the doctor.

JASMINE: (to a camel standing nearby) Hello Doctor. How's it going?

ALADDIN: No, no, no. Not this one. (To ABU, whose pockets are bulging.) Come, Sultan.

(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he stole from the cart falls out.)

OWNER: Huh? What is this? (ABU picks up what he's carrying and the trio run away.) Come back here, you little thieves!

(Cut to inside the JAFAR laboratory. IAGO is spinning a gear in a strange contraption. There is a storm on top of the machine.)

[explosion]

IAGO: (flushing and blowing) With all due respect, Rot, can't we just wait for a real storm?

JAFAR: Hold your breath, Iago. Faster. (He places SULTAN's tire in the machine.)

IAGO: Yes, O mighty Evil One. [flushes]

(IAGO runs faster. Lightning passes through the ring and transfers to the hourglass below. The sand begins to spin.)

JAFAR: Gone, the sands of time. Let me know who gets into the cave.
(The sand at the top forms the Cave of Wonders.
It falls into a storm, but it shows ALADDIN climbing a ladder, followed by JASMINE, who is covered in her veil.)
Yes Yes! Here it is. My diamond in the rough.

IAGO: Is it he? Is this the clown we've been waiting for? (IAGO loses his footing and is absorbed in the gears.)

JAFAR: Let's let the guards offer him an invitation to the palace, okay?

(IAGO walks past and hits the wall upside down.)

IAGO: Fine. [cough]

(JAFAR laughs horribly, and the camera zooms into the sandstorm with ALADDIN.
Finally, we merge with the real ALADDIN climbing to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)

[sad laugh]

ALADDIN: I'm almost there.

(JASMINE climbs over, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms. He gets up.)

JASMINE: I want to thank you for arresting this man.

ALADDIN: Forget it. (He grabs the bar.) So, this is your first time at the market, huh?

(ALADD pole-jumps to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE: Is it that obvious?

ALADDIN: Well, you stand out pretty well. (She looks at him, still in love. She returns his gaze.
But he realizes he did and goes back to normal.) I mean, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.
(He places a plank between the buildings so she can walk on it, but when she bends down, he jumps over her head. She turns in surprise.
He throws a stick at her. ALADDIN and ABU's eyes are bulging.)

JASMINE: I'm a quick learner.

ALADDIN: That is true. Come here. (They go to the roof of the building, avoiding planks and beams as they go.) Huh. Watch your head out there. Be careful.

JASMINE: Do you live here?

ALADDIN: Yes. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.

JASMINE: Great.

ALADDIN: Well, it's not much (he pulls back the curtain to reveal the palace), but it's a great view. The Palace looks really great, doesn't it?

JASMINE: Oh, that's lovely.

ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and servants...

JASMINE: Oh yeah. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.

ALADDIN: It's better than here. You always have to scratch to find food and dodge guards.

JASMINE: You are not free to make your own choices.

ALADDIN: Sometimes you feel so...

JASMINE: You just...

BOTH: (together) – trapped.

(They look at each other and realize they are perfect for each other. But then ALADDIN realizes where he is and breaks his gaze.
He takes the apple from ABU's hand and rolls it with his arm into JASMINE's hand.)

ALADDIN: Well, where are you from?

JASMINE: What does it matter? I ran away and I'm not coming back.

ALADDIN: Really? How so? (She bites the apple in her hand, then hands it to ABU, who looks disgusted.)

ABU: Why are you...!

(ALADDIN approaches and sits next to JASMINE.)

JASMINE: My father is forcing me to marry.

ALADDIN: It's... it's horrible. (ABU appears behind the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU runs to a higher level, chattering and cursing as he goes.)

JASMINE: What?

ALADDIN: Abu says... uh... that's not fair.

ABU: What?

JASMINE: Oh, right?

ALADDIN: Yeah, sure.

JASMINE: And does Abu have anything else to say?

ALADDIN: Well, he hopes he can do something to help him.

ABU: Oh boy!

JASMINE: Hmm... tell her it's very... nice.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE come closer and closer until ALADDIN leans in to kiss him. He is interrupted by the guards who found them.)

RULER: There you are!

ALADDIN and JASMINE: They're after me! (to each other) Are they after you?

JASMINE: My father must have sent them...

ALADDIN: Do you trust me?

JASMINE: What?

ALADDIN: Do you trust me? (She holds out her hand)

JASMINE: Yes. (He takes it.)

ALADDIN: Then jump!

(Both jump from the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt. They try to escape, but the GUARD blocks the exit.)

GUARD: We keep bumping into each other, don't we, street rat?

(ABU shoots the guard's turban again, but other guards are there and block the exit.
The first RULER rips the ABU from his head and throws him into a vase. Three more guards catch ALADDIN.)
-
RULER: This is a dungeon for you, son.

ALADDIN: Hey, let me go!

JASMINE: Let him go.

WARNING: (not realizing she's a princess) Look what we've got here, men: a street mouse. (She throws him to the ground.)

JASMINE: (stands up and takes off the hood of her coat) Let her go on the princess's orders!

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)

PROTECTION: Princess Jasmine.

ALADDIN: A princess?

ABU: (looks at vase) Princess?

RULER: What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat?

JASMINE: It's not your problem. Do as I say. Free him!

RULER: Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from Jafar. You should discuss this with him.

(GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing.)

JASMINE: (looking very tired) Believe me, I will.

(Look inside the palace, JAFAR comes out of his secret apartments.
He closes the door carefully, but the princess rushes in before he can finish. He closes it and remains on IAGO's door frame.)

JASMINE: Jafar?

JAFAR: Oh, princess.

IAGO: Oh! Jafar, I'm stuck!

JAFAR: How may I be of assistance to you? (She spreads her cloak and hides the door.)

JASMINE: The guards just took the boy to the market on your orders.

JAFAR: Your father told me to keep the peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.

JASMINE: What was the crime?

IAGO: I cannot breathe, Jafar.

JAFAR: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.

IAGO: If you could only... (JAFAR pushes him back inside the door and it closes) - wow, that hurts!

JASMINE: He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!

JAFAR: (walking away as if shocked) Oh my God! Oh, how shocking. If I would have known.

JASMINE: What do you mean?

JAFAR: Unfortunately, the boy's sentence has already been served.

JASMINE: What sentence?

JAFAR: (sinful voice) Death. (JASMINE gasps.) By beating.

JASMINE: No! (He falls to the ground.)

JAFAR: I'm very sorry, princess.

JASMINE: How could you? (She runs out of the room crying.)

(IAGO finally manages to get through the door. He flies away and lands on JAFAR's shoulder, coughing.)

IAGO: How did it go?

JAFAR: I think he took it... pretty well. (They both have dark smiles on their faces.)

(Talk at night to JASMINE, crying by the fountain. RAJAH comes to comfort her. He caresses her.)

JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his name.

(Cut to the inside of the dungeon. The rats scurry and we go down until we see ALADDIN chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN: (to himself) She was a princess. I can not believe it. I must have looked so stupid to him!

ABU: (distant) Yoo-hoo! Aladdin? Good morning!

(The ABU appears in the window at the top of the dungeon.)

ALADDIN: Abu! Here! Hey, help me out of this.

(ABU stops, then starts talking wildly, falling to the ground. He wraps the cloth around his head and makes big eyes to imitate the princess.)

ALADDIN: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, he was worth it.

(ABU jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulders and takes a small set of tools from his pocket, then releases ALADDIN.)

ABU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ALADDIN: Älä huoli, Abou. En näe häntä enää koskaan. Olen katurotta, muista, ja siellä on laki. Hänen täytyy mennä naimisiin prinssin kanssa. Hän ansaitsee prinssin.

(ABU vapauttaa lopulta ALADDINin kädet.)

ABU: Ta-da!

ALADDIN: (hieroi ranteitaan) Olen... Olen tyhmä.

VANHA MIES: Olet vain typerys, jos annat periksi, poika.

(Näemme nurkassa istuvan vanhan miehen, jota ALADDIN ja ABU eivät ole ennen nähneet.)

ALADDIN: Kuka sinä olet?

VANHA: Nöyrä vanki kuin sinä. Mutta yhdessä voimme olla enemmän.

ALADDIN: Kuuntelen.

VANHA MIES: Siellä on luola, poikani... ihmeiden luola, täynnä aarteita, jotka ylittävät villeimmät unelmasi. Lyön vetoa, että aarre riittää tekemään vaikutuksen jopa prinsessaisi.

(Kuuntelijat huomaavat, että OLD MAN lausui sanan "prinsessa" "prinsessa" pikemminkin kuin "PRIN-cess" -ääntämisessä.
VANHA MIES kääntää hänelle selkänsä ja IAGO pistää päänsä ulos JAFARin "vanhan miehen" naamiosta.)

IAGO: Jafar, voitko pitää kiirettä? Minä kuolen tähän. [huutaen]

ALADDIN: Mutta laki sanoo, että vain prinssi voi...

VANHA MIES: Olet kuullut kultaisesta säännöstä, eikö niin? Kuka omistaa kullan, tekee säännöt. (Hän hymyilee ja näyttää hirvittävän huonoa suuta.) [vinkuva nauru]

ALADDIN: Miksi sitten jakaisit kaiken tämän ihanan aarteen kanssani?

VANHA MIES: Tarvitsen nuoren parin jalkoja ja vahvan selän jahtaakseni häntä.

ALADDIN: Ongelma. Se on siellä. Olemme täällä.

(VANHA MAN kävelee seinää kohti ja työntää piilotettua uloskäyntiä.)

VANHA: Mm-mm-mm. Asiat eivät aina ole sitä miltä ne näyttävät. Joten… onko meillä sopimus?

(ALADDIN katsoo ABUa, joka kohauttaa olkapäitään.)

ABU: Voi, en tiedä.

(Cut to a desert scene. We see ALADDIN leading a horse with OLD MAN and ABU. Diss. in the Cave of Wonders.)

[thunder crashes]

CAVE: Who disturbs my sleep?

ALADDIN: It's me, Aladdin.

CAVE: Go ahead. Do not touch anything other than the lamp.

(The cave opens with a roar and stairs appear in front of ALADDIN.)

OLD: Remember, my son, go get me a lamp first, and you will have your reward.

ALADDIN: Come on, Abu. (To ABU hiding under his coat shoulder.)

[squeal]

(ALADDIN begins to descend the stairs. He reaches the bottom and enters a golden chamber filled with treasures.)

ALADDIN: Would you like to see it?

ABU: [complains] Ohh.

ALADDIN: Just a handful of these things would make me richer than the Sultan.

(ABU looks, sees the treasure, then rushes towards it.)

ALADDIN: Abu.

[white]

(ABU stops halfway, hovering over the carpet on the floor.)

ALADDIN: Don't touch anything. We need to find this lamp.

(They begin to walk across the room when MATTO rises from the floor and begins to follow them. ABU has the feeling that they are being followed.)

ABU: Häh?

(He turns around and MATTO is lying on the ground. He continues and MATTO starts following again.
ABU turns around again, but the CARPET is rolled up and leaning against the treasure pile. (ABU runs towards ALADDIN and pulls his trouser leg.)

ABU: Aladdin, Aladdin.

ALADDIN: Abu, will you stop him?

(Again MAT follows, but this time when ABU turns, the mat jumps to the other side.
He comes down with a pompom and pulls ABU's tail. When ABU jumps, CARPET jumps to the other side again.
This time, ABU lands in a karate stance. MATO bends down and grabs ABU's hat, then puts it on himself.
ABU thought for a moment until MATO waved an acorn in his face. ABU and CARPET both jump in fear and run away.
ABU grabs ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)

[yell]

ALADDIN: Abu, what are you, madman?

(A CARPET appears behind the treasure pile.)

ALADDIN: The Magic Carpet. Come on. Go out. I'm not going to hurt you.

(CARP comes out slowly, timidly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts it. He flies towards ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to him.
(ABU shouts and jumps on ALADDIN's shoulder.)

[yell]

ALADDIN: Hey, take it easy, Abu. He's not going to bite. THANK YOU.

(CARPET picks up ABU's hat again and hands it to him. ABU clenches his fist and yells at it. CARPET starts to walk away, "sad".)

[squeal]

ALADDIN: Hello. Wait a moment. Do not go. Maybe you can help us. (CARPET looks back excitedly. Then it flies over and wraps around the couple.)
Hey, huh. Look, we're trying to find this lamp. (CARPET motions them to follow him.) I think he knows where he is.

ABU: [squeals excitedly] [echoes]

(They go through a long cave until they emerge into a giant underground cavern. In the center of the room is a large pillar with stairs leading up to it.
It is surrounded by water and unevenly placed stones form a bridge. At the top of the pillar is a beam of light. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN: [whispers] Wait here.

ABU: [complains] Oh. Huh? I see!

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey. There is a giant ruby ​​in outstretched paws. ABU hypnotically pulls it. ALADDIN runs quickly up the stairs.
CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail, trying in vain to hold him back. ALADDIN finally reaches the TAG LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Is that it? This is why we came here... (He looks down and sees ABU breaking free from the MAT and rushing towards the jewels.)
Abu! NOW!

(ABU grabs the jewels. A rumble is heard and the room begins to shake.)

VOICES FROM CAVES: Infidels!

ABU: Ohoh.

VOICE FROM THE CAVE: You have touched the forbidden treasure! (ABU puts the gem back in the paw, but the gem and shrine melt into lava.)
From now on, you will never see the light of day again!

ALADDIN: Wow!

(ALADDIN runs down the stairs, but they flatten into a ramp, and he descends until he flies into the air. The water has turned to lava.
He falls towards her when suddenly the WORM appears and catches him. ABU is standing on one of the rocks on the bridge.
He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. Then CARPET rushes in and ALADDIN catches him just as the last stone explodes.)

ABU: Help, help, help!

ALADDIN: I got you! Wow Matto let's move!

(Together they run through the caves, avoiding walls and falling debris. ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.)

ALADDIN: Abu! Abu, now is not the time to panic! (He pulls the ABU off his head and sees them fly into the wall.) Start panicking!

[Abu pant] [thunder crack] [roar]

(CARPET dives and then passes through another cave. Finally, they emerge through the inner door. Outside, the cave begins to groan and close.
MATO and company are almost on top when a rock drops to the mat and a THX Optimizer clip sends him to the floor.
ALADDIN grabs the rock wall and hangs. He sees the OLD MAN above, within reach.)

ALADDIN: Help me!

OLD MAN: Throw me a lamp!

ALADDIN: I can't stand it. Give me your hand!

OLD MAN: Give me the lamp first!

(ALADDIN reaches out and takes the EARTH LAMP. He holds it out and the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)

OLD: [laughs] Yes! finally! [lights the lamp]

[Aladdin struggles]

(ALADDIN gets out with ABU's help. But the OLD MAN pushes ABU away and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)

ALADDIN: What are you doing?

OLD MAN: I'll give you your prize! (JAFAR continues in his normal voice.) Your eternal reward. [yell]

(He picks up the twisted dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN when ABU bites him on the wrist. He screams but lets go of ALADDIN, who falls into the cave.
OLD Man also throws ABU into the cave. The clip ends with THX Optimizer falling out. CARPET sees him but is stuck under a rock.
He struggles to free himself, then he does. He rushes and catches up with ALADDIN, but he has already crashed into the wall several times and is unconscious.
On the surface, the cave roars one last time and then sinks back into the sand. JAFAR takes off his mask.) [yells]

[roar]

JAFAR: It's mine! It's all mine! I-- (He can't find it in his pocket) Where is it? No! No...!

(The kiss disappears into JASMINE's room. She sits on her bed next to a sad-looking RAJAH. SULTAN enters.)

SULTAN: Jasmine? Oh my darling. What's wrong?

JASMINE: Jafar… did… something… terrible. (She appears to be crying.)

SULTAN: There, there, there, my child, we will make things right. Now tell me everything.

(Cut to inside the cave. ALADDIN is lying unconscious on the WORM. ABU tries to wake him.)

ABU: Oh, oh. Aladdin? Wake up. Aladdin.

(TAPIT gets up and picks up ALADDIN. He slowly wakes up.)

ALADDIN: Oh my head. (He looks at the sealed entrance.) We're stuck. (Angry, clenching his fist at the entrance) That two-faced jackal boy!
(Reassuring) Whoever he is, he's long gone with that lamp.

ABU: Yes!

(ABU takes out the MAGIC LAMP)

ALADDIN: Hello! Well, you little furry thief! It looks like decrepit, worthless scrap metal.
Hi, I think there is something written here, but it's hard to understand.

(He rubs the LAMP. Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN clings to the lamp, and our lovely friend,
GENIUS comes out.)

GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! Oh! Ten thousand years is such a pain in your neck! (He hangs ALADDIN on a nearby rock.
He then rips his head off and spins it around screaming. MATTO knocks ALADDIN down.)
Wow! Does it feel good to be outside! (GENIE uses the end of his lamp as a microphone.)
Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi, where are you from? (He puts the microphone in front of ALADDIN's face.) What's your name?

ALADDIN: Uh, al--uh--Aladdin.

GENIE: (says his name as if discovering something important) Aladdin! (A neon sign with ALADDIN's name lights up surrounded by chase lights.
The character changes to reflect the next line of GENIUS.) Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you "Ali?" » Or maybe just "Din?" »
Or how about "Laddi?" » (GENIE disappears, then a dog wrapped in a blanket enters.) They would say, "Here, my boy! Come, Laddi!

ALADDIN: (shaking his head) I hit my head harder than I thought.

GENIE: (Still the dog) Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do? (The dog poops in the smoke, then returns to the GENIUS. ABU howls wildly.)
Oh, sorry Cheetah, I hope I didn't burn the fur! Hi Rugman! I haven't seen you in a few millennia! Give me the pompom!
Hey! Yeah! (A CARPET flies over and greets NERO. NERO looks at ALADDIN.) Say, you're much smaller than my last master.
(He raises his beer belly.) Either that or I gained weight. Look at me from the side: Do I look different to you?

ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I am... your master?

GENIE: (Places the diploma in ALADDIN's hand and the grenade on his head.) That's right! We can teach him!!
What would you like from me, (like Arnold Schwarzenegger) always impressive, (in a cube) long content, (like a ventriloquist with a doll)
often imitated, (throws the mannequin aside) but never duplicated -- (He multiplies into several GENEs surrounding him.) DUP.

GENIES: Duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.

GENIUS: (He says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.) Lamp genie! (He enters Ed Sullivan) Here, straight from the lamp,
here to enjoy and fulfill your wishes. THANK YOU!

ALADDIN: Wow! Wish fulfillment?

GENIUS: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-no for wishing for more wishes. (Turns into a slot machine, the hand goes down and three Genies appear in the windows.)
That's it: three. (Three GENIE caballeros come out of the place.) Uno, dos, tres. (Exchanges to b/w Groucho Marx.) No exchanges, exchanges or refunds.
(The duck falls with the secret word "Refunds".

ALADDIN: (to ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming.

Genie: Master, I don't think you really understand what you have here! So why not just ruminate while I illuminate the possibilities.
[Nero]
Well, Ali Baba had forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand stories
But control yourself with luck, because you have your work cut out for you
You have magic that never fails!
(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIUS appears in his vest, then reaches out and subdues the thieves.)

[Nero]
You now have power in your corner
Some heavy ammo in your camp
You have punch, spice, yahoo and how
See, all you have to do is rub this lamp
And I say
(A boxing ring appears, in ALADD's corner, GENIUS rubs. Then GENIUS turns into a firecracker and explodes, shooting one of our heroes.
Then GENIUS appears inside the lamp and grabs ALADDIN's hand and rubs the lamp with it.)

[Nero]
Mr. Aladdin, sir
What is your joy?
Let me take your order, write it down
You've never had a friend like me
No no no!
(GENIE prepares the table and chairs, then writes things down on a notepad, like a waiter.)

[Nero]
Life is your restaurant and I am your master!
Come on, whisper what you want
You've never had a friend like me.
(The GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but expands his ear to listen to ALADDIN. He finally explodes into four twin genies.)

[Nero]
Yes sir we are proud of our service
You are the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you want, it's yours!
A real dish How about a little more Baklava?
(The Gens give him a shave, a haircut, and a manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfortable armchair (eh?) surrounded by treasure and adored by women.
GENIUS appears and fills the screen with baklava.)

[Nero]
Try a little column "A"
Try the entire column "B"
I'm willing to help you man
You've never had a friend like me
(ALADDIN climbs a food column with a giant A at the top, then jumps to another column with a B at the top.
He falls and gets caught in the pillow held by GENIE. He opens his mouth and his tongue turns into a staircase.
A miniature NERO dressed as a magician appears. Mini GENIE does a little dance with two giant hands.
Eventually they surround the minigen and crush him.)

[Nero]
Can your friends do this?
Do your friends do this?
Will your friends pull this out of a small hat?
Can your friends go crazy!
Well, look here
Can your friends go to Abracadabra, let them rip
And then make this bastard disappear?
(NERO rips off his head, copies it, then juggles them.
He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand, spinning one end on his fingertip like a basketball.
He throws his head at NERO, who is trying to get up from the hat at the base.
He goes around in a circle until he turns into a white rabbit. The rabbit turns into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
The dragon breathes fire, which transforms into three HAREM GIRLS who dance around ALADDIN. As soon as he starts enjoying them, they disappear.)

[Nero]
So don't just sit there, limp, empty
I am here to answer all midday prayers
You got me in good faith, proof
Do you have a genius in charge? business!
I have a strong desire to help you
So whatever you want, I really want to know
You no doubt have a wish three miles long
So all you have to do is rub like this, and oh!
(The GENIE imitates what he calls ALADDIN, then transforms into a certificate that wraps and surrounds ALADDIN.
NERO takes a list {written in Arabic} from ALADDIN's ear, which he rubs his buttocks with as if to dry himself after a shower.)

[Nero]
Mr. Aladdin, sir, I'd like two or three
I'm at work, big mogul
You've never had a friend, you've never had a friend
You've never had a friend, you've never had a friend
You've never... had a friend... like... me!
You've never had a friend like me!
(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN bends to kiss one. He transforms into NERO, who brings four dancing elephants.
In the other direction, he blows up four dancing camels, and a big final dance number follows, and our heroes dance.
ABU collects as much gold as he can, but GENIE wraps it all in a cyclone and wipes it out until they're all back in the cave.
GENIE has a neon "APPLAUSE" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that it is empty.)

GENIE: What will it be, Master?

ALADDIN: Will you grant me my three wishes?

GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. There are some reservations, some considerations

ALADDIN: Like?

GENIE: Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anyone. (She cuts his head off with her finger.) So don't ask.
Second rule: I can't make anyone fall in love with someone else. (The head turns into a large pair of lips kissing ALADDIN.)
Small penalty there. (Lies flat, then gets up and turns into a zombie.) Rule Three: I can't raise people from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like it! (He returns to normal.) Otherwise, there you have it!

ALADDIN: (looking at ABU as if scheming) Ah, reservations? Do you mean boundaries? based on wishes?
(To ABU) Some all-powerful geniuses can't even bring people back to life. I don't know, Abu. He probably won't even get us out of this cave.
Looks like we have to find a way out of here...

(They start to leave, but a big blue foot steps in front of them.)

GENIE: Excuse me? Are you looking at me? Are you rubbing my lamp? Did you wake me up, bring me here? And suddenly Petit me?
(Gets angrier and angrier) I don't think so, not at the moment. You got your wish, so sit back!
(They all get on the CARPET. GENIE is the stewardess, and many hands point to the exit.)
In an emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, anywhere!
Keep your hands and arms inside the mat. Weeee'rrrrreee… get out of here..

(MATTO and passengers fly out of the desert sand into the distance. Cut to the Sultan's room.
JAFAR is there with IAGO, JASMINE and SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is a scandal. If it weren't for all the years of good and loyal service...
From now on you must discuss with me the sentencing of the prisoners before their heads are beheaded.

JAFAR: I assure you, Your Highness, this will not happen again.

SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, let's put this complicated matter behind us now. Please?

JAFAR: My apologies, princess. (She takes his hand to kiss it, but he pulls it away.)

JASMINE: At least it's something good if I'm forced to marry. When I'm queen, I have the power to get rid of you.

SULTAN: That's nice. So everything was agreed. Now, Jasmine, back to this suitor thing, (she looks and sees Jasmine coming out)
Jasmine? Jasmine! (She runs after him.)

JAFAR: I wish I had that lamp!

IAGO: (JASMINE) I have the power to get rid of you! I see!
We think we have to keep kissing this idiot and his idiot daughter for the rest of our lives…

JAFAR: No, Iago. Only until she finds an idiot husband. Then he'll banish us... or behead us!

MOLEMAT: Eeewww!

IAGO: (having an idea) Oh! Wait a moment! Wait a moment! Jafar? What if you were an idiot husband?

JAFAR: (He looks at IAGO insultingly) What?

IAGO: Okay, you're going to marry a princess, okay? So you become the Sultan!

JAFAR: Ah! Marrying a snot? I will be the Sultan. Thought is merit!

IAGO: Yes, deserve it! Yeah! And then we drop the stepfather and the little wife off the cliff! (Feed the bombs on the ground) Kersplat!

JAFAR: Iago, I love the way your dirty little mind works!

(Both laugh as we leave for an oasis in the desert, where the WORM arrives to land.)

GENIE: (Still as flight attendant) Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs. Do not stand until the treadmill has come to a complete stop.
(As ALADDIN and ABU descend the stairs formed by the CARPET) Thank you. Goodbye! THANK YOU! Bye! (Back to normal)
Good now. And that, Mr. Mustafa, who doubts?

ALADDIN: Oh, you showed me that well. Now for my three wishes -

GENIUS: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You're down ONE, son!

ALADDIN: Ah, no, I never really wanted to leave the cave. You did it alone.

(GENIE thinks for a moment, then her jaw drops. She turns into a sheep.)

GENIE: Well, don't I just feel dim? All right, baaaaad boy, but no more gifts.

ALADDIN: A fair deal. Three wishes, then. I want them to be good. (GENIELE) What do you want?

(GENIE hangs like a hammock between two trees.)

GENIE: Me? No one has ever asked me that before. Well, in my case, ah, forget it.

ALADDIN: What? Won't tell me.

GENIUS: Freedom.

ALADDIN: Are you a prisoner?

GENIUS: It's all part and parcel, the whole concert of genius. (Becomes gigantic, voice resonates) Phenomenal cosmic powers!
(Shrinks, cramped TAIL LAMP.) Small living space

ALADDIN: Genius, it's terrible.

GENIE: (Exiting the lamp) But oh... to be free. No need to say "whoah! What do you need? pooh! What do you need? pooh! What do you need?"
To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and treasures of the world! But what am I talking about here?
Let's be real here. IT'S NOT HAPPENING. Genius, wake up and smell the hummus.

ALADDIN: Why not?

GENIE: The only way I can get out of this is if my master wants me to leave. So you can guess how often this happened.

ALADDIN: I will. I will set you free.

GENIE: (Head transforms into Pinocchio's head with a long nose) Um, that's right. Yell!

ALADDIN: Not really, I promise. (She pushes her nose back and Genie's head returns to normal.)
After making my first two wishes, I will use my third wish to set you free. (She holds out her hand)

GENIE: Well, I hope so. (He shakes hands with ALADDIN.) Very good. Let's make magic. (He turns into a magician.) So what? What do you want most?

ALADDIN: Well, there's this girl.

GENIUS: Ehhh! (Like a buzzer, and Genie's chest shows a heart with a cross through it.) Wrong. I can't make anyone fall in love, remember?

ALADDIN: Oh, but, Genie, he's smart and funny and...

GENIUS: Beautiful?

ALADDIN: Great. He has these eyes… and this hair. Wow. And his smile… [sigh]

GENIUS: (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and MATO.) Friend. It's love.

ALADDIN: But she's a princess. To have a chance, I'd have to be... Hey, can you make me a prince?

GENIE: Let's see here. (Is "the royal cookbook".) Chicken a la king? (He takes a chicken with a crown on its head) No. Alaskan king crab.
(He detaches his fingers and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from "The Little Mermaid" being squeezed.) Ouch. I hate it when they do that. Caesar salad? Ah!
(A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et Tu, Brute? No. Aha. "Make a prince." (He looks at ALADDIN with a sly look.) Is this an official wish? Say those words.

ALADDIN: Genie, I wish you would make me a prince!

GENIE: Very good! Whoah Whoah Whoah Whoah! (Gets square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.)
First of all, this Fez and Vest combination is way too third century. These places – what are we trying to say – are begging? No! Let's work with me here.
(He takes Aladdin's measurements, snaps his fingers, and ALADDIN puts on his prince costume.) I like it, muy macho! Now I need something else.
What does that tell me? It's about the means of transportation. Sorry, monkey boy! Aqui, this way!

(ABU tries to cover himself with a CARPET, but GENIE catches him and he flies over.)

ASHES: Ohoh!

GENIE: Here he comes (ALADDIN and GENIE are on the set of a game show where ALADDIN is standing on a podium with "AL" on it.)
And what better way to enter the streets of Agrabah than by riding your very own brand new camel!
Be careful, it spits! (The door with the Genie's head opens, where ABU turns into a camel. He spits a clue out of the side of his mouth.
But Genie isn't sure.) Mmm, not enough. (He snaps his fingers and ABU transforms into a fine white horse.) It's still not enough. Wait and see. What do you need?
(GENIUS snaps his fingers repeatedly and transforms ABU: a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac with the license plate "ABU 1".
(That's a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail fins I didn't say. Eventually it went back to normal.)
Yeah!! Esalalumbo, Shimin Dumbo! Wow!! (And with the spell keyword, Dumbo ABU turns into an elephant.
CARPET struggles to get away from the size of the ABU (46ft.) Talk about trunk space, watch this action!

(ABU sees his reflection in the pool of water and then jumps into a tree.
The tree naturally leans to the ground where ABU grabs and looks upside down at ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Abu, you look good.

GENIUS: He's got an outfit, he's got an elephant, but we're not done yet. Hold on to your turban, kid, because we're going to make you a star!

(We slowly zoom into a distant oasis as fireworks begin to explode outside. Cut to a pile of toys. (Find BEASTS here.)
We bow and see SULTAN balancing them. He balances carefully on the last piece, then sits back and sighs.
However, JAFAR barges in and the stack collapses.)

JAFAR: Sir, I have found a solution to your daughter's problem.

IAGO: Oh! A problem with your daughter!

SULTAN: Oh, really?

JAFAR: (unrolls scroll) Here. "If the princess has not chosen a husband by the agreed time, the sultan will choose for her."

SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all these suitors! (He tries to put the cookie in Iago's mouth. IAGO steps back. SULTAN absentmindedly takes the cookie away.)
How can I choose someone he hates? (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly puts the biscuit in his mouth.)

JAFAR: Do not worry, my lord. There's more. If no suitable prince is found, the princess must marry... hmm... interesting.

SULTAN: What? WHO?

JAFAR: Royal Vizier! Well, that would be… me!

SULTAN: Well, I thought the law said only a prince could marry a princess, I'm pretty sure.

JAFAR: Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord. (He takes out a stick and hypnotizes SULTAN with it.)

SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...

JAFAR: You command the princess to marry me.

SULTAN: I... command... princess...... (spell breaks for a moment)... but you're so old!

JAFAR: (holding wand closer) The princess will marry me!

SULTAN: The princess will marry... (the spell breaks again, this time to a fanfare of "Prince Ali's" trumpets.)
What? What is this? This music! Hahaha. Jafar, you have to come see this!

(We see a parade advancing, led by what appears to be a HUGE GENIUS in human form.)

WALKERS: Tell Prince Ali!

SWORDSMEN: Greetings! It's Prince Ali!

MAJOR: Hey, lead the way in the old bazaar, Hey you, let us pass, that's the new bright star, Oh, come, be the first in your neighborhood to catch his eye!
Make way, here it is, ring the bells, beat the drums. You will love this guy

(MAJOR mingles with various members of the crowd.) Prince Ali, wonderful he, Ali Ababwa! Genuflect, show respect by kneeling

(ABU the elephant crosses the city with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.)
Now do your best to stay calm. Spice up your Sunday afternoons and come meet its wonderful crowd.

(IAGO dances to the music until JAFAR looks at him. MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men into ABU's trunk.
They stand on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.) Prince Ali, he is great, Ali Ababwa! Strong as ten ordinary men, definitely
He faced the galloping herds. A hundred rogues with swords Who sent these fools to their masters, Why Prince Ali!

(The stack collapses on ALI, but the GENIE(TM) lightning blasts the stack and he ends up holding them all in an acrobatic cartwheel.
NERO turns into an old man, then a child, and speaks the last two lines to the audience.)

MALE CHORUS: (carrying camels) He has 75 golden camels!

(In Pops, a typical parade commentator)

HARRY: Aren't they lovely, June?

FEMALE CHORUS: (on float) Purple peacocks, there are 53 of them!

(Another commentator arrives.)

JUNE: (Mary Hart voice) Great, Harry. I love feathers.

GENIE: (GENIE is off-screen, a giant balloon monkey walks the parade)
As for exotic mammals, does he have a zoo, it's a world class zoo!

(The GENIE appears as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two lines to the two earlier children.
We move to the balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are accompanied by a HAREM GENIE.)

GENIUS: (in the voice of ETHEL MERMAN)

GIRLS: (in counterpoint, hearts beating)

Prince Ali, he is handsome Ali Ababwa There is no doubt that this Ali is charming
This physics, how can I speak Never plain, never boring Weak in the knee
Everything about this man impresses. Well, get out of there. He is a miracle, he is a genius, a miracle. Adjust your sails and get ready.
He's going to break my heart To stare and crawl and look at Prince Ali! And I love her outfit!

(JASMINE looks from the balcony of the palace. She sighs.)

CHORUS: He has 95 white Persian monkeys!

(He has monkeys, Let's see monkeys!)

And there's no charge to watch them!

(He is generous, so generous)

He has slaves, he has servants and henchmen!

(Proud to work for him)

They bend to his whims, love to serve him

They're just asses when it comes to being loyal to Ali! Prince Ali!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins at people who rush to collect them. ABU, ALADDIN and the procession go up the palace steps and enter.
SULTAN runs back to the throne room door, but JAFAR is standing in front of the door.
Suddenly it opens, led by ABU and ALADDIN, crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

CHORUS and GENIUS: Prince Ali, in love with her! Ali Ababwa!

GENIE: I hear your princess is a lovely sight!

And so, folks,

He got dressed and left

CHORUS: 60 elephants, llamas galore

With its bears and lions

Marching band and more

With its 40 fakirs, cooks and bakers

His birds are chirping on the sidelines

Make way for Prince Ali!

(More and more fanfare ensues until ALADDIN flies onto ABU's back onto the MAGIC CARPET and flies towards the SULTAN. JAFAR slams the door shut.)

SULTAN: (clapping) Wonderful, absolutely wonderful.

ALADDIN: (takes a deeper voice.) Ahem. Your Majesty, I have come from afar to seek your daughter's hand.

SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course. Nice to meet you. (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.) This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He is also happy.

JAFAR: (Very dry) Ecstatic. I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...

ALADDIN: --Ababwa!

JAFAR: It doesn't matter. PROPERLY. You can't just roll up here uninvited and wait…

SULTAN: ...Allah, this is a truly remarkable device. (He pulls the pom poms, and they pull his mustache.) I don't think I could...

ALADDIN: Of course, your majesty. I can.

(He helps SULTANI to the CARPET and he falls down. JAFAR pins the CARPET to the ground with a stick.)

JAFAR: Sir, I must advise you not to...

SULTANI: -- You can button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.

(He kicks the stick and the WORM and SULTAN fly away. IAGO, who was standing at the end of the stick, falls,
striking the rod repeatedly with its beak as it descends.
SULTAN and CARPET fly high to the ceiling and then launch a bomb attack, fly under ABU, scaring him.
The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI chat in the foreground.)

JAFAR: Where did you say you were from?

ALADDIN: Oh, much further than you've traveled, I'm sure. (He smiles. JAFAR doesn't.)

JAFAR: Try me. (Iago lands on the stick.)

SULTAN: Look, Polly!

(They all fall back in time as the WORM whistles a few inches above their heads. THE WORM returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)

IAGO: Hey, look at this. Look at him with that stupid carpet!

(MATTO zooms below IAGO, who sighs, wipes his forehead, and crashes into a pillar.
He hits the ground and around his head is a miniature SULTANTS ON CARPET saying "Have a cracker, have a cracker".
The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Off, I'm coming down. Jafar, look at this! (It descends.)

JAFAR: Awesome, Your Highness.

SULTAN: Oh, wonderful. Yes, I seem to have a gift for it. (CARPET walks towards ABU in a daze, then falls. ABU catches him.)
This is a very impressive youth. And the prince too. (Whispers to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.

JAFAR: I don't trust him, sir.

SULTAN: This is absurd. One thing I pride myself on, Jafar, is that I am an excellent judge of character.

IAGO: Oh, excellent judge, yes, of course… no!!!

(JASMINE enters quietly.)

SULTAN: Jasmine likes this!

ALADDIN: And I'm pretty sure I'm going to love Princess Jasmine!

JAFAR: Your Highness, no. I have to speak for Jasmine. (JASMINE hears this and gets angry.) This boy is no different from the others.
What makes him think he's worthy of a princess?

ALADDIN: Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pokes JAFAR's goatee, which shoots in all directions.)
Let him meet me. I will win your daughter!

JASMINE: How dare you! (Everyone looks at him in astonishment.) Are you here to decide my future? I am not a prize to be won! (He rushes out.)

SULTANI: Oh my God. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Give Jasmine time to calm down. (They go out.)

JAFAR: I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince Abooboo.

(Talk to JASMINE on her balcony at night. We bow down to find ALADDIN and company in the yard.)

ALADDIN: What am I going to do? Jasmine won't even let me talk to her. I should have known I wouldn't be able to fulfill this stupid princely wish.
(ABU struggles with his watch case to open the banana. He smashes it and the banana flies into his eyes.
Then he throws the banana peel in the same pile.)

GENIE: (on carpet, playing chess) So move! (CARPET does so, knocking the black piece off the board.) Hello. It's a good decision. (as Rodney Dangerfield)
I can't believe it, I'm losing all-in.

ALADDIN: Genius, I need help.

GENIE: (As Jack Nicholson) All right, Sparky, here's the deal. You want to wet the little lady, you must be a fair shooter, follow me?

ALADDIN: What?

GENIE: (Returning to normal, carrying a grenade launcher. He shows his words on the board) Tell him... THE TRUTH!!!

ALADDIN: No way! If Jasmine found out I really was a dirty street rat, she would make fun of me. (He puts on his turban, which lights up like a GENIUS.)

GENIUS: A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh! (ALADDIN pulls the chain and turns off the lights. GENIUS comes out holding the right turban.)
Al, kidding aside, you really should be yourself.

ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing I want to be. Okay, I'll go see him. I have to be gentle, cool and confident. How do I look?

GENIE: (Sadly) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN flies to the balcony on TAPIS. JASMINE is on her bed, sighing. RAJAH is by her side.)

ALADDIN: (Far away) Princess Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and sighs.)

JASMINE: Who's there?

ALADDIN: It is I, Prince Ali. Ahem--(Then he jumps into his deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.

JASMINE: I don't want to see you.

ALADDIN: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance.

(RAJAH growls and walks towards him.)

JASMINE: Leave me alone.

ALADDIN: Down with the cat!

(On the other side of the balcony CARPET looks down and GENIE below.)

GENIE: How is our little friend?

(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.)

ALADDIN: Come, good cat, take away and go. Kitten down. (He takes off his turban to push RAJAH away.)

JASMINE: (She looks at him, thinking about how she's seen him before.) Wait, wait. I know you?

ALADDIN: (changing his turban quickly) No, no.

JASMINE: You remind me of a person I met at the market.

ALADDIN: The market? (A bee buzzes around his head.) I have servants who go to the market for me.
Why do I have servants who go to the market because of my servants, so the one you meet cannot be me.

JASMINE: (looking disappointed) No, I guess not.

BEE: (It's NERO) Enough of you, Casanova. Talk about him! He's smart, funny, hair, eyes. Whatever: choose a feature!

ALADDIN: Oh, Princess Jasmine? You are very…

BEE: Lovely, great, wonderful, spot on!

ALADDIN: Exactly!

JASMINE: Punctual?

BEE: Sorry.

ALADDIN: Great.

BEE: Nice improvement.

JASMINE: Hmm. I'm rich too, you know.

ALADDIN: Yeah!

JASMINE: Daughter of the Sultan.

ALADDIN: I know.

JASMINE: A great price for any prince to marry.

ALADDIN: That is true. PROPERLY. A prince like me.

BEE: (whispers in his ear) Watch out! Warning!

JASMINE: That's right, a prince like you. And every other fluffy, sassy, ​​peacock shirt I've come across!

BEE: (On fire again, glasses on and falls) Mayday! Help!

JASMINE: Go jump off the balcony! (He turns and walks away)

ALADDIN: What?

BEE: Stop him! Stop him! Do you want me to poke him?

ALADDIN: (He hits the bee) Off!

BEE: Okay, great. But remember: be yourself! (The bee buzzes in his turban)

ALADDIN: Yeah, it's true!

JASMIN: What!?

ALADDIN: Er, you're right. You're not just a prize to be won (He looks disappointed.)
You should be free to make your own choices. JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other confused.) I'm going to go now. (He climbs to the edge and descends.)

JASMINE: No!

ALADDIN: (poking his head over the edge) What? What?

JASMINE: (Now she's surprised) How -- how do you do that? (He looks over the edge and sees a CARPET.)

ALADDIN: It's a flying carpet.

JASMINE: That's wonderful. (MATO takes Jasmine's hand with a pompon.)

ALADDIN: You, uh, don't want a ride, do you? We could leave the palace and see the world.

JASMINE: Is it safe?

ALADDIN: Of course. Do you trust me?

JASMINE: (She looks at him after hearing this very important sentence) What?

ALADDIN: (Stretching out his hand as before) Do you trust me?

JASMINE: (leaves a smile on her face) Yes.

(He takes her hand and climbs onto the CARPET. He zooms up into the sky and makes them both sit.
The music for "A Whole New World" swells. JASMINE turns around and sees RAJAH looking at her questioningly.
He gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky.)

ALADDIN: I can show you the world Brilliant, shining, wonderful. Tell me princess, when was the last time you let your heart decide?

(CARPET zooms through town, pausing to pick a flower. He gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. He smiles.)
I can open your eyes Make you wonder On, on the side and under the flying carpet

(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings and then zooms into the clouds.) A whole new world!
A fantastic new perspective No one will tell us no or where to go Or say we're just dreaming

(JASMINE looks back and watches as Agrabah disappears from view. THE WORM flies in and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE: A whole new world A dazzling place I've never known. But when I'm up there, it's crystal clear that now I'm in a whole new world with you!

ALADDIN: Now I'm with you in a whole new world!

(They each catch a small cloud as the WORM continues its flight. It then circles the column of clouds, giving it a swirling appearance.)

JASMINE: Unbelievable views The indescribable feeling of soaring, soaring, rolling free through the endless diamond sky

(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks terrified and screeches.
CARPET does somersaults and flips, occasionally sending ALADDIN and JASMINE into a free fall, only to catch them.
Then they zoom above the clouds, where a starry night awaits them.)

JASMINE: A whole new world!

ALADDIN: Don't you dare close your eyes

JASMINE: A hundred thousand things to see

ALADDIN: Hold your breath, it'll get better!

JASMINE: I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far that I can't go back to where I was!

(They fly over a river, apparently the Nile, because behind the ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.
They salute the worker who carves the entire nose of the sphinx. He smiles, but you cut too much and break the front of his nose.)

ALADDIN: A Whole New World!

JASMINE: Every twist is a surprise

ALADDIN: New horizons to pursue

JASMINE: Any minute, red letter

(They fly alongside the running wild horses. JASMINE caresses one of them.)

BOTH: I'll chase them anywhere. It's free time Let me share this whole new world with you. A whole new world There we are

(They cross Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it with his arm towards JASMINE,
(who is now certain that he is dealing with ALADDIN, not Prince ALI.)

ALADDIN: The Thrilling Chase

JASMINE: Great place

BOTH: For you and me!

(The CARPET floats over the lake and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake.
Fireworks go off and we see a couple at a Chinese New Year celebration sitting on the roof.)

JASMINE: It's so magical.

ALADDIN: Yeah.

JASMINE: (looking at him) Too bad Abu had to miss this.

ALADDIN: No. He hates fireworks. (CARPET looks up, realizing what's happening.) He doesn't like to fly either.
(And now ALADDIN realizes it) It's… oh no!

JASMINE: (she takes off her turban) You're a market boy! I knew it. Why did you lie to me?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, I'm sorry.

JASMINE: Did you think I was stupid?

ALADDIN: No!

JASMINE: I wouldn't understand?

ALADDIN: No. I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't. No, that's not what I meant.

JASMIN: Who are you? Tell the truth!

ALADDIN: The truth? (He looks at the CARPET, who signals him to continue, losing hope.)
The truth, uh... the truth is, sometimes I dress like a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life. (MATO collapses in defeat.)
But I really am a prince! (A feather from his turban falls into his eyes.)

JASMINE: Why didn't you tell me?

ALADDIN: Well, you know, uh... royalty going to town in disguise, that seems a little odd, doesn't it?

JASMINE: Not so weird.

(She picks up her feather and snuggles up to him. MATO puts the pom-pom under her "chin" and looks mystified.
Dissolve outwards. from the palace balcony where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. CARPET forms the stairs and descends.
ALADDIN then descends under the balcony.)

JASMINE: Good night, handsome prince.

ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but MATO bumps into him and they kiss faster than expected.
He slowly walks away and then turns to look at her. Finally, he enters her room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN: Yes! (She lands on the CARPET, which lands on the floor.) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go well.

(He looks up at Jasmine's balcony and four pairs of hands grab him.)

ALADDIN: Hello! What? (A gag is tied around his mouth. Muffled words) Abu! Abu! (We see an elephant hanging from a net attached to a tree.)

ABU: Yes?

WARNING: Hold the tail!

(Chains are placed on his feet and hands. Another WARNING ties the CARPET around the tree.)

JAFAR: I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo. (He walks away.) Make sure he's never found.

(A GUARD hits him on the head and he falls unconscious. Cut to a cliff where the GUARDS laugh as Aladdin's body falls into the water.
He is now conscious, but his leg is tied to a rock. The stone hits the bottom of the sea, then the turban descends and the lamp falls.
He sees this and tries to rub the lamp. However, he loses consciousness and falls to the ground.
Disturbed by his movement, the lamp spins and rubs against his hands. He shakes and GENIUS emerges with a bath brush, a rubber duck and a shower cap.)

GENIUS: Never fail. Take a bath and wash the lamp. (duck quack) Hi. (see ALADDIN'S UNCONSCIOUS)
Al? Al! Child, stop! You can't fake this! I can't help you unless you wish.
You have to say "Genius, I want you to save my life." I got it? Clear. Go Aladdin!! (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and shakes him.
His head rises and then falls.) I like that. (Head turns into a mermaid.) Wooga! Wow! (Turns into a submarine.)
Up to the area! (He laughs something that sounds German. A giant jet of water appears on the surface and lands on the rock.
ALADDIN wakes and spits water from his lungs.) Don't scare me like that!

ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh... (He can't say it, so they just kiss.) Thanks, Genie.

GENIE: Oh Al. I'm starting to like you, boy. Not that I want to choose curtains or anything.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing her hair. SULTANI appears in one of the double doors, hypnotized.)

SULTANI: Jasmine!

JASMINE: Oh, Dad, I just had the most amazing time. I am so happy.

SULTAN: (Still monotonous from hypnosis) You should be, Jasmine. I chose a man for you.

JASMINE: What?

SULTAN: (Another door opens to reveal JAFAR.) You will marry Jafar.

(JASMINE gasps at the sight.)

JAFAR: You're speechless, I see. A great quality in a wife.

JASMINE: I will never marry you. (He goes to SULTAN) Father, I choose Prince Ali!

JAFAR: Prince Ali is gone!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in front of the balcony door.)

ALADDIN: You better check your crystal ball again, Jafar!

JASMINE: Prince Ali!

(JAFAR gasps when he sees ALADDIN.)

IAGO: How the hell... (back to the parrot)... uh, awk!

ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar. You tried to kill me!

JAFAR: What? (He goes towards the SULTAN) This is ridiculous, Your Highness. He is clearly lying. (He brings the stick closer to SULTAN's face.)

SULTAN: Apparently... lying.

(ALADDIN sees the wand with his glowing eyes.)

JASMINE: Dad, what's wrong with you?

ALADDIN: I know what's wrong!

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and slams it into the ground. JAFAR jumps and the spell is broken for good.)

SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh, my God!

ALADDIN: Your highness, Jafar rules you with this! (He brings the stick forward)

SULTAN: What? Jafar?! You traitor!

(The trio advances on JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

SULTAN: Guards! Guards!

IAGO: Well, that's all, we're dead, forget it. Just dig a grave for both of us. They were dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket. He makes a move, but the guards catch him.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.

JAFAR: It is not done yet, my son!

(JAFAR takes a bottle from his pocket. ALADDIN sees him and rushes towards him, but JAFAR throws the bottle on the ground.
A big red cloud appears. When he's gone, so is JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find him! Search everywhere!

ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you okay?

JASMINE: Yes.

(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTANI comes between them.)

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted advisor, has been plotting against me all this time. Simply awful. How could I ever -
(He stops mid-sentence and looks at the two men.) Can this be true? Has my daughter finally chosen a suitor?
(He nods) Ha ha! Praise Allah! You brilliant boy, I could kiss you! I don't... I'll leave it to me... You're married at the same time!
Yes Yes. And you will be happy and prosperous, and then my son, you will be my Sultan!

ALADDIN: The Sultan?

SULTAN: Yes, an honest young man like you, a person of impeccable morals, is exactly what this kingdom needs!
(ALADDIN looks worried.)

(Cut to JAFAR's apartments. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO: We must get out of here! We have to... I have to start packing, Your Highness. Only the essentials (IAGO starts throwing objects out of the cage.
JAFAR smiles broadly.) Travel light! Bring on the guns, guns, knives (stops and takes a picture of him and JAFAR) and what about this picture?
I don't know, I think I'm making a weird face. (JAFAR starts laughing wildly.) Oh boy, he's cracked. He went crazy.
(IAGO flies towards him and strikes his head.) Jafar! Jafar! Hold on! (JAFAR grabs him by the neck) Good catch!

JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing but that ragged boy, Aladdin! He has a lamp, Iago.

IAGO: Why is it wretched...

JAFAR: But you can get away with it!

Iago: Me?

(Cut to outside the palace. ALADDIN looks at the gardens.)

ALADDIN: The Sultan? They want me to be their sultan?

(GENIE comes out of the lamp)

GENIE: Huzzah! Hail to the conquering hero! (Turns into a one-man band. He sees ALADDIN walking away with his head down.
He stops, scratches his head, gets an idea, then walks over to ALADDIN.
He raises his hands like a director framing a film and we watch them.)
Aladdin! You have just won the heart of a princess. What are you going to do next?
(ALADDIN looks at him, then walks sadly to the bed, where he collapses on it and sighs. GENIUS is again confused,
then goes to him and takes a manuscript called "Aladdin". Whisper :) Psst. Your phrase is: "I release the genie." Whenever.

ALADDIN: Genius... I can't.

GENIE: Of course you can. You just say, "Geeeenie, I want you to be free. » (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses it as a ventriloquist dummy.
ALADDIN walks away.)
ALADDIN: I'm serious! I'm sorry, I really am. But they want to make me Sultan... no! They want to make Prince Ali Sultan. Without you I'm just Aladdin.

GENIE: Al, you win!

ALADDIN: Because of you! The only reason people think I'm worth anything is because of you! What if they find out I'm not really a prince?
(Calmly) What if Jasmine finds out? i would lose it. Genius, I can't do this alone! I...I cannot wish you freedom.

GENIE: (sarcastically) Fine, I see. After all, you lied to everyone.
Hey, I'm starting to feel left out. Now if you'll excuse me, sir... (He says the last word in disgust, then returns to the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET watch from the window.)

ABU: Ohoh...

ALADDIN: Genie, I'm so sorry. (Tongue sticks out of beak and raspberry it.) Good, very good!
(She covers the LAMP with a pillow.) So... hang in there! (He looks at ABU and the CARPET.) What are you looking at?
(They both leave.) Listen, I... I'm sorry... A-Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't... wait. Come on! (He sighs.) What do I do? Nero is right.
I...I have to tell Jasmine the truth.

JASMINE: (from a distance) Ali, oh Ali, are you coming here?

ALADDIN: (Sighing as he puts on his turban) Well, there we go. (He enters the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?

(We see IAGO dressed in a cape and standing on wooden splits next to FLAMINGO in a pond. He imitates JASMINE's voice.)

IAGO: Huh... In the Menager, make haste.

ALADDIN: I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN rushing past, oblivious to the birds. IAGO laughs wickedly, then turns to look into the panting FLAMINGO's face.)

FLAMINGO: Uh!

IAGO: Got a problem, pinky?! (He sweeps the bird's legs from below.
IAGO laughs happily as he runs through the palace and finds the lamp under the pillow.)
Boy, Jafar is glad to see you! (He stretches his face like JAFAR's and imitates him.)
Great job, Iago! (Normal) Ah, go on. (JAFAR) No, really – on a scale of one to ten, you… are an eleven!
(Normal) Oh Jafar, you're so nice. I'm embarrassed, I blush. (She flies away with the lamp.)

(Cut to the palace entrance. The SULTAN stands at the top and makes an announcement to the people.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor!

(Cut behind the curtain to where JASMINE is looking. ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine?

JASMINE: Ali, where have you been?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, I have something to tell you.

JASMINE: The whole kingdom gathered for father's announcement!

ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me!

JASMINE: Good luck! (She pushes him onto the stage with SULTAN, where he can see the whole crowd.)

SULTAIN: ...He's a Dog!

ALADDIN: Oh my God.

(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR look through the window.)

IAGO: Look at them, they applaud the little whiner.

JAFAR: Let them clap. (He picks up the lamp and rubs it. THE GENIUS comes out.)

GENIE: You know Al, I can (turns around and sees JAFAR) really yyyyyy - I don't think you're him. (He goes down and asks for the poster.)
Tonight, the role of Ali is played by a tall, dark and gloomy man.

JAFAR: I am your master now! (He throws GENIE to the ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.)

GENIE: I was afraid of it.

JAFAR: Genie, grant me my first wish. I want to rule on high AS SULTAN!

(Cut to where dark clouds surround the castle. The castle shakes. The roof is torn off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN shoot each other.)

ALADDIN: Wow!

SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What is happening? Oh my god, what's going on?!

JASMINE: Dad!

(His turban comes off his head. As he catches it, his whole body flies away, then he is stripped of all his clothes except his boxers.
The clothes reappear in JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Hey hey hey!

SULTAN: Jafar, you... vile traitor.

IAGO: To you it is Sultan Vile Betrayer.

ALADDIN: Oh, right? Well, we'll see! (removes his own turban, but finds it empty) Lamp!

JAFAR: Finders-keepers, Abooboo.

(They both look up to see a giant GENIUS lifting the palace into the sky. ALADDIN whistles and MATTO flies to greet him.
They fly near GENI's head.)

ALADDIN: Genius! No!

GENIE: Sorry, son, I've got a new master now. (He places the palace on top of the mountain.)

SULTAN: Jafar, I command you to stop!

JAFAR: Ah, but now there's a new order... MY order! Finally you bow to me!

(SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)

JAFAR: We will NEVER bow to you!

IAGO: Why am I not surprised?

JAFAR: If you don't bow to the Sultan, you bow to the Wizard!
(to GENIE) Genie, my second wish: I want to be the most powerful wizard in the world!

ALADDIN: Nero, STOP!

(GENIE extends his finger. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he can't, and another GENIE(tm)-branded bolt of lightning hits JAFAR, returning him to his normal appearance.)

IAGO: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Agrabah, Jafar the wizard!

JAFAR: Now where were we? Ah yes, a terrible humiliation! (He hits JASMINE and SULTAN with his staff and they both bow to him.
JAFAR laughs as RAJAH rushes towards him. He grabs RAJAH and the tiger turns into a cat.)
Down, son! Oh princess... (raises her chin with her wand)... I want to introduce you to someone.

ALADDIN: (off camera) Jafar! Do not touch her!

(JAFAR robs ALADDIN. THE WORM flies away.)

JAFAR: Prince Ali Yes, that's him, but not as you know him. Read my lips and face reality

(JAFAR brings them together in the air.) Yes, there will be a blast from your past that the lies were too good to withstand. Say hello to precious Prince Ali!

(JAFAR brings ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO: Or should we say Aladdin?

JASMINE: Ali.

ALADDIN: Jasmine...

JASMINE: What?

Aladdin: I was trying to tell you, I'm just...

JAFAR: So Ali just turns out to be Aladdin. Just a scam, should I continue? Believe me His personality flaws Give me reason enough
Sending him packing with a one-way ticket to His potential terminal plunge His frozen assets, chosen location It's the end of the world, oops!
Sooooooooooo,

IAGO: Farewell, see you soon!

JAFAR: Ex-Priiiiiiiince Aaaaaaaallllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

(JAFAR is ABU back to normal. He sends them both into a large pillar and then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET gets inside.
F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland where a pillar falls and rolls. Eventually it stops. ALADDIN emerges, visibly very cold.)

ALADDIN: Abu? Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!

(He looks at the shivering snow.) Oh, it's all my fault—I should have released the spirit when I had the chance.
(He digs out ABU and puts him in his vest.) Abu! Do you agree? I'm sorry, Abu. I messed it up...
in any case. I have to go back and fix things. (He starts walking in the snow and ends up walking on a frozen CARPET.)
Carpet! (He looks up and sees that the CARPET is attached to the pole. He pulls to try and free the CARPET.
He can't do it, so he starts clearing the snow from the base of the pillar.) Abu, start digging! That's it!
(Finally, enough snow has been removed and the pillar begins to roll. ALADDIN runs away, looks back, then settles down.
The pillar rolls over him, and as it disappears, ALADDIN and ABU find themselves sitting in the patch of snow formed by the pillar's window.)
Yeah! Clear! (He looks up at his turban made of a frightened ABU. MATO shakes off the snow and rushes to collect them.)
Now back to Agrabah! Let's go!

(We return to a long exterior shot of Agrabah shrouded in red clouds. Cut to a slow interior zoom of the throne room.
IAGO is tied to the SULTAN like a doll, and JASMINE is chained to the throne.)

IAGO: The puppet master wants some biscuits? Here are your cookies. Shove them all down your throat. Enough here!

(JAFAR pulls the chain and JASMINE approaches him holding an apple.)

JASMINE: Stop! Jafar, leave him alone!

(IAGO pauses for a moment, then continues.)

JAFAR: It pains me to see you become this, Jasmine. (She bites the apple he's holding.) A beautiful desert flower like you should be on the arm of the greatest man in the world. (She wags her finger and the crown appears.) What do you say, darling? Why, when you're the queen...

(She takes a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)

JASMINE: Never!

JAFAR: I'm going to teach you respect! (She falls back as he raises his hand to hit her. Then he stops.) No. Genius... I decided to make my last wish. I wish Princess Jasmine would fall hopelessly in love with me.

(JASMINE sighs. We see ALADDIN running back into town.)

GENIE: (again as Buckley) Ah, master... there are some additions, quid pro quo.

JAFAR: Don't answer me, you big scoundrel! YOU do what I tell you to do...slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN at the window, beckoning him to play a game.)

JASMINE: (She gets up and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar! Um, I never realized how... incredibly beautiful you are.

(NERO's jaw drops.)

JAFAR: Mm, that's better. (He lifts NERO's chin like a shadow.) Now... kitty, tell me more... about myself.

JASMINE: You are... tall... and dark...

JAFAR: Yes?

JASMINE: Well dressed...

(JAFAR approaches him. ALADDIN jumps with ABU and GENIE sees them.)

GENIE: Al! Al, little friend!

ALADDIN: Shh!

GENIE: (Literally closes her mouth and then opens it.) Al, I can't help you, I'm working for a master psycho now. (His head transforms into JAFAR's and then returns.)

ALADDIN: Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? (He closes GENI's mouth.) I improvised.

(He slides a pile of coins and hides near JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR turns his back on ALADDIN.)

JAFAR: Jatka.

JASMINE: And your beard... is so... crooked! You stole my heart... (She wraps her arms around him.
He pretends to go around with his finger, but in fact he is calling ALADDIN to come. He makes his move. IAGO sees it.)

IAGO: Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)

JAFAR: What about a street rat?

JASMINE: What street rat?

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over the bowl. JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE catches him and kisses him.
ALADDIN looks disgusted. (Both IAGO and ABU look disgusted.)

ABU JA IAGO: Snap!

JAFAR: It was... (he sees ALADDIN's reflection in his crown.) YOU! How many times do I have to kill you, boy?!

(He scowls at ALADDIN. JASMINE rushes at him and he throws her to the ground. ALADDIN rushes and grabs the stick.)

ALADDIN: Get the lamp!

(JASMINE runs towards him. However, JAFAR shakes ALADDIN and then sends him into the hourglass.)

JAFAR: No! Ah-ah-ah, princess... Your time is up!

ALADDIN: Jasmine!

(Sand starts falling on him from above.)

IAGO: Ooh, nice move, Jaf-- (He's knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU rushes towards the lamp.)

JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He turns into a toy monkey.)

ALADDIN: Abu!

(TAPIT rushes.)

JAFAR: Things are moving fast now, son! (JAFAR laughs as the CARPET is unrolled and dismantled.
ALADDIN rushes towards the lamp again.) Do you understand? (His path is blocked by large swords stuck in the ground.
JAFAR grabs the lamp and laughs horribly. ALADDIN pulls the sword from the ground.) I'm just warming up! (He spits the Ring of Fire around ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?!

JAFAR: Snake, right? Maybe you want to see how much I can look like a snake! (He smiles widely and we see a snake's tongue sticking out from behind his teeth.
He then transforms into a giant cobra and the ring of fire around ALADDIN is part of the serpent surrounding ALADDIN.
The snake JAFAR moves on ALADDIN and on the third try ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR. (Cut to GENIE cheerleaders wearing A-line sweaters.)

GENIES: Rickem, rockem, racem, rake - stick that sword in that snake!

JAFAR: Stay out of it!

(GENIE waves a small pennant with a "J" on it.)

GENIE: (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man. If he can't do it, AWESOME!

(ALADDIN uses a distraction to break the hourglass with JASMINE trapped in it. However, JAFAR sees her and blocks the path.
ALADDIN is thrown and loses his sword.)

JASMINE: Aladdin!

(ALADDIN leaps onto a large jewel and glides across the ground, grabbing the sword as he goes.
He turns the corner, but the snake chasing him can't, and JAFAR's front crashes through the wall and crashes outside the palace.
ALADDIN jumps on the snake's back and stabs it. JAFAR screams in agony. ALADDIN tries to free the princess again.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine, wait!

(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR catches him.)

JAFAR: (laughs hideously) You little fool! Did you think you could defeat the most powerful creature on earth?!

IAGO: (GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze it like... awk! (GENIE nudges him)

JAFAR: Without genius, my son, you are nothing!

ALADDIN: (has an idea) Genius. Genius! Genie has more power than you will ever have!

JAFAR: What?!

ALADDIN: He gave you your powers! He can take it off!

GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?

ALADDIN: Admit it, Jafar! You're still just...second best!

JAFAR: You're right! His strength surpasses mine. But not for long...

(JAFAR spins around the GENIUS.)

GENIUS: This boy is crazy. He's a little drunk. One shot too many with a snake. (His hand turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)

JAFAR: Slave! I'm making my third wish! I want to be... THE ALMIGHTY GENIUS!

GENIE: (reluctantly) Very good. Your wishes are orders. Well done, Al.

(GENIE breaks JAFAR with one last GENIE(tm)-branded lightning bolt). JAFAR's snake form dissolves and he turns into a spirit.
We see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand. ALADDIN runs up and ends up breaking the glass. (Sand and Princess Jasmine fall out.)

JAFAR: Yes... Yes! Power... Absolute power!

JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What did you do?

ALADDIN: Believe me!

(A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base. JAFAR casts a spell.)

JAFAR: The universe belongs to me! Control!

ALADDIN: Not so fast, Jafar! Don't you forget something?

JAFAR: (looking down questioningly) Huh?

ALADDIN: Do you want to be a genius? You got it!

(Chains appear on JAFAR's wrists.)

JAFAR: WHAT?!

ALADDIN: And all that goes with it!

JAFAR: Hey! NOOOOO!

IAGO: I'm leaving!

ALADDIN: Phenomenal Cosmic Powers!

(IAGO tries to fly away, but is caught by JAFAR.)

IAGO: Come, you are a genius! I don't want, I don't want--!

ALADDIN: A very small living space.

GENIUS: Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU returns to normal, MATO parades again, JASMINE, SULTAN and RAJAH stand together.
RAJAH jumps into SULTAN's arms, then they all transform. SULTAN is crushed by the weight of the new RAJAH.
The palace reappears where it was in the city. ALADDIN holds a new lamp.)

JAFAR: (both from inside the lamp.) Get your beak out of my face!

IAGO: Oh, shut up, you idiot!

JAFAR: Don't tell ME to shut up!

GENIE: Let me. (He takes the lamp and goes to the balcony. He is now wearing a cap.
Finally, he wants to throw the lamp, but opens his palm flat and throws it with his finger into the desert.)
Ten thousand years in the Cave of Wonders should calm him down!

(Jafar and Iago continue to argue as they disappear. Jasmine walks towards Aladdin. They hold hands, but both look sad.)

Aladdin: Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about the prince.

Jasmine: I know why you did it.

Aladdin: Well, I guess...this...is this goodbye? (GENIE pokes her head into the corner, shocked by what she heard.)

Jasmine: Oh this stupid law. It's not fair! I love you.

Genie: (wipes a tear) Al, it's okay. You have one more wish left. Just say the word and you'll be a prince again.

Aladdin: But Genie, what about your freedom?

Genie: Hey, it's just an eternity of slavery. It's love. (She leans next to him.)
Al, you won't find another girl like her in a million years. Believe me, I know. I looked.

Aladdin: Jasmine, I love you, but... I have to stop pretending to be something I'm not.

Jasmine: I see.

(They look into each other's eyes for the last time, then ALADDIN turns to NERO.)

Aladdin: Genie, I desire your freedom.

Genius: The True Pedigree of a Future Prince. What I ?

Aladdin: (He holds the lamp towards GENIE.) Genie, you're free!

(A transformation scene follows, where the chains fall from GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)

Genie: (She can't believe it.) Hey, hey! I am free. I am free. (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.) Quick, quick, wish for something special.
Say "I want Nile". Nile's wish. Try this!

Aladdin: I hope for the Nile.

Genie: No way! (Laughs hysterically. He bounces on the balcony like a pinball machine.) Oh, Does it feel good! I am free! I'm finally free!
I'm about to hit the road. I'm going to explore the world! I--

(She packs her suitcase, but looks down to see ALADDIN looking very sad.)

Aladdin: Genie, I'm gonna miss you.

Genie: Me too, Al. (sniff) No matter what anyone says... you'll always be a prince to me.

(They kiss. The Sultan comes forward.)

Sultan: That is true. You have certainly proven your worth in my opinion. This law creates a problem.

Jasmine: Dad?

Sultan: Well, am I a Sultan or am I a Sultan? From this day on, the princess will marry whomever she deems worthy.

Jasmine: (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN's arms.) He! I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.

Aladdin: Hello. Call me Al.

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands bring everyone together. Genie is wearing a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.)

Genie: Oh, all of you. Come here. Big group hug! Group hug, oops! Do you mind if I kiss a monkey? (She kisses Abu.)
Oh hairball! Well, I can't make any more mess around this ice cream stand. I'm leaving! Goodbye, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hello, Rugman: ciao! I am history! No, I'm mythology! No, I don't care what I am, I'm free!

(Genie flies into the blue sky, leaving a trail of sparks behind.
They cut (a jump cut is made worse as fireworks explode over the nightscape. We pan to see Aladdin and Jasmine flying on the carpet.)

[Aladdin]
A whole new world
[Jasmine]
A whole new life
Both:
(with off-camera chorus) For you and me!
[male chorus]
A whole new world!
(They fly away in the moonlight, and after they disappear, the moon turns to reveal NERO's laughing face.
Suddenly the film is torn from the "projector", GENIUS raises it and looks at the audience.)

Genie: I made you watch.

(Returns movie to normal, moon to normal. Fade to black)


Aladdin

(Fade to black. Hip of purple mist before a wall of red flames.
- The fog is formed in golden letters: "Aladdin". The letters sparkle and fly away. In the wilderness, a small merchant rides a camel)

Pedlar: ♪ Oh, I'm from the country, ♪

(On the night street, a merchant gets up from his camel and speaks to us)

[camel panting]

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. Please come closer.
(Camera zooms in and hits the shopkeeper in the face) Too close. A little too close.
(He moves his face slightly away from the camera) There we go. Welcome to Agrabah, the city of mystery, enchantment,
(Opens a camel bag that turns into a bazaar stall) and the most beautiful things this side of Jordan, on sale today.
Get lost. Uh huh. Look at this. Yeah. Hookah and coffee maker combination. Also makes julienne potatoes. No offense. (she taps it on the table) no...
It broke. Oops! Look at this. (Takes Tupperware) I've never seen one intact before. This is the famous Tupperware from the Dead Sea.
Listen. (She opens it, makes a raspberry sound..) Ah, that's always good. (Camera starts panning to the right. Merchant rushes to grab him.) Wait, don't go there! (Stop the pan.)
I notice that you are only interested in what is exceptionally rare. I think you'd be well rewarded then, come to think of it.
(The merchant takes out the iconic Magic Lamp from his sleeve.) Don't let its mundane appearance fool you.
As with many other things, it's not what's on the outside that counts, it's what's on the inside. (Another pan, this one slower to the left.
Once again the merchant rushes in.) This is no ordinary lamp! It changed the young man's life.
The young man who loved this lamp was more than what he seemed. A diamond in the rough. Maybe you'd like to hear a story?
(The merchant pours shiny sand from the lamp into his hand.)
It begins on a dark night… (The merchant throws sand into the sky where it forms a starry nightscape.) where a dark man waits with a dark purpose.

(Camera pans to reveal Jafar sitting on his horse and Iago on his shoulder. Gazeem walks up to them.)

[horse nickels]

Jafar: You're late.

Gazeem: Many apologies, oh Patient One.

Jafar: Do you have it then?

Gazeem: I had to cut a few throats, but I made it. (He takes half of the locket. Jafar grabs it, but Gazeem pulls it out.) Ah-ah-ahhh. Treasure. (Iago Iago shouts as he passes and grabs the locket.) Alas!

Jafar: Trust me, my prickly friend. You get what comes to you.

Iago: What ails you? Ouch!

(Jafar takes out the other half of the locket. He joins them to form a golden beetle. It comes to life and flies away.)

Jafar: Quick! Follow the path!

(On horseback, the trio chases the locket across the moonlit desert)

Faster!

(The creature splits in two, each half lodged in a sand dune. A massive tiger head emerges from the dune. Bits of the beetle form its glowing eyes.
Men's horses rear up on their hind legs and topple their riders. Jafar smiles as the tiger head opens its hollow mouth.)

[horse neighs]

[howling wind]

Jafar: Finally, after all the years of searching, the Cave of Wonders.

Iago: Awk. Cave of Wonders!

Gazeem: (whispering) By Allah...

Jafar: Now remember. Bring me the lamp! The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine. [laugh]

(Gazeem begins to approach the lion's mouth, which is the entrance to the cave. He laughs as he walks away.)

Iago: Oh lamp. Oh, the lamp. (Now that Iago and Jafar are alone, Iago opens up in normal English.) Damn it, where did you find that bozo?

(Jafar puts his finger to his lips and silences him. Gazeem crawls towards the mouth entrance of the cave.
He looks inside his mouth as his tongue turns into a staircase.
He dribbles around one of the tiger's teeth, but is startled by the roar of the cave's words.)

Cave: [echoing growl] Who's disturbing my sleep?

Gazeem: [the thief hatches] It's me, Gazeem, the humble thief.

Cave: Mo that. Only one gets in, the one whose value is far away. A diamond in the rough.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look.)

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Jack.

[beast sighs]

(Gazeem hesitates, then steps inside the cave. He puts his foot down with great fear. Nothing happens. Relieved, he resumes his walk. Then another roar is heard. He turns, but the Lion's mouth closes and the dune collapses and returns to normal. Only Jafar remains, Iago and the two separate halves of the medal.)

Jafar: Now!

Cave: Find a diamond in the rough.

Iago: [coughs] I can't believe it. I just don't believe it! We'll never get our hands on that stupid lamp! Forget it! Look at this. Look at this.
I'm so tickled I'm peeing. (She flies onto Jafar's shoulder.)

Jafar: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem apparently wasn't worth it.

Iago: (very sarcastic) Oh, there's a big surprise. It's unbelievable... I think I'm going to have a heart attack and die from this surprise.
What are we going to do? We have a big problem here, a big- (Jafar pinches his beak.)

Jafar: Yes. Only one can enter. I need to find this, this... diamond in the rough.

(Cut to the ceiling where Aladdin rushes to the edge carrying the bread. He almost drops it over the edge.)

Razoul: Stop! Thief! I'll take the trophy from you, street rat!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.) All this for bread? Oooooh!

(He jumps and lands on two ropes strung between buildings, clothes drying on top. He lowers them into the sky, picking clothes off himself as he goes. Finally he approaches the end of the rope near the window as a woman reaches out and bangs on the shutters. Aladdin bangs on the shutters and falls to the street, his fall is broken by numerous awnings and a pile of clothes around him. He takes off the clothes on the top floor and is about to suck his bread. when…)

Guard 1: There he is!

Guard 2: You won't get through this easily!

Aladdin: Did you think it was easy?

(She looks at the three women and mocks them.)

Razoul: You two, this way, and you, follow me. We will find him.

(Aladdin puts a sheet over himself and wraps himself up to disguise himself. He rushes towards the women.)

Aladdin: Hello, ladies.

Woman 1: We're in trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?

Aladdin: Problem? Now it's gone. You'll only get in trouble if you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin's shoulder and pulls him back. It's Razoul. Aladdin's mask falls off.)

Razoul: I got you!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (Abu shouts, then the guard's turban is lowered over his eyes. Abu points to the guard's head, laughing.)

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Ash: Ash.

Aladdin: Come on. Let's get out of here. i have to keep...

(The guard swings at Aladdin, but destroys the fish barrel. Abu waddles at the guard, then dodges the attack. Aladdin then pulls down the guard's pants)

♪ One jump before the finish line ♪

♪ A step ahead of the sword ♪

♪ I only steal what I can't afford ♪ That's all.

(Aladdin runs away, the guard gives the fish over the lower body like pants.)

♪ One step ahead of the law ♪

♪ That's it and now it's a joke ♪

♪ These guys don't like that I'm broke! ♪

(Aladdin and Aby climb a stack of barrels and then knock it away from the guards.)

Guards: (one at a time) ♪ Riffraff! ♪

♪ Street rat! ♪

♪ Cheater! ♪

(throws fruit to Aladdin) ♪ Take it! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Just a little snack, guys. ♪

Guards: ♪ Tear it up, take it back, guys! ♪

(Aladdin runs to the top of the stage. The guards shake the stage back and forth to try to make him fall.)

Aladdin: ♪ I see ♪

♪ I have to face the facts ♪

(Aladdin leaps from the stage to his certain death only to grab Abu's hands like an acrobat. The pair sway in the harem.)

♪ You're my only friend, Abu! ♪

Harem Girls: Who?

♪ Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom ♪

(Abou finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth like a chipmunk.)

♪ He became single to increase crime ♪

Woman 2: ♪ I'd blame the parents, except he didn't leave them. ♪

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live,

♪ I must steal to eat ♪

♪ I'll tell you all about it when I have time! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu come out and bounce on the awning. Cut to a muscular man bowing before the crowd.
The guards hurried. Cut to Aladdin and Abu following the muscle man as he moves until they make a mistake and are spotted. )

♪ Jump ahead of slow kicks. ♪

♪ One step before my loss. ♪

♪ Next time I'll use a pen name. ♪

Razoul: There he is!

(The sequence where Aladdin and Abu, chased by guards, run through a herd of sheep and hit the artist sleeping on a bed of nails [of course the very large guard lands on him])

Aladdin: ♪ Jump ahead of the murderers ♪

♪ A step ahead of the pack ♪

♪ I think I'll go for a walk in the neighborhood ♪

(Abou disguises himself with jewelry until the merchant finds him.)

Man 1: ♪ Stop, thief! ♪

Merchant 1: ♪ Vandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Abu! ♪

Woman 3: ♪ Scandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Don't be in too much of a hurry ♪

(Aladdin is surrounded by GUARDS in front of the door. The door opens and a tall, ugly woman enters)

Woman: ♪ I think it's pretty tasty though! ♪

(Aladdin stoops and puts his arm around the guard, acting as if they were all friends.)

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live, ♪

♪ I must steal to eat ♪

♪ Otherwise we'd get along just fine! ♪

Guards: WRONG!!!

(Guards jump on Aladdin, but get tangled up. Their paint slips into the pots)

Head Guard: Get him!

(Aladdin jumps on the artist who is walking harmlessly across the hot coals. The guards rush through the coals, jumping in pain as they burn their feet.
Aladdin and Abu encounter a sword swallower, after which Abu returns to take the sword from the swallower's mouth. (Abu walks towards the guards, who stop in fear.)

Guard: He has a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We all have swords!

(Guards draw their swords. Abu lowers his sword and runs away. Aladdin and Abu are surrounded again, guards coming from left and right.
(He jumps and climbs a costume stunt going on down the street as all the guards bump into each other.)

Aladdin: ♪ One jump before the hooves hit ♪

Guards: Vandal!

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the hump ♪

Guards: Street rat!

Aladdin: ♪ One turn before disaster ♪

Guards: Trickster!

Aladdin: ♪ They're fast, but I'm much faster ♪

Guards: Take it!

(The guards chase Aladdin up the stairs into the room. He grabs the rug...)

Aladdin: ♪ Alright, ♪

♪ You better get your hands on it ♪

♪ I wish you a safe landing, ♪

♪ All I have to do is jump! ♪

(..and jumps out the window like the carpet is magic. The guards follow him out the window, but fall right into the street and land in a fertilizer cart with a sign saying "Mad Hakim's Discount Fertilizer.")

Guards: Cheers! Hey!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely and out of danger. Aladdin and Abu greet each other)

Aladdin: And now, esteemed effendi, we celebrate. Clear.

(Aladdin cuts the bread in half and gives half to ABU, who begins to eat.
But Aladdin looks and sees two small children looking for food in the garbage.
The girl sees him, then drops her find and tries to hide. Aladdin looks solemnly at them, then at the bread, then at Abouta.)

Abu: Nam, nam! Voi ei.

(Abou eats a large piece of his food, but Aladdin gets up and walks towards the children. The girl pulls her brother back.)

Aladdin: [sighs] Here. Jack. Take it.

[laugh]

[waste]

Abu: Ah, don't do that. Huh?

Man: On the way to the palace, I guess. Another suitor for the princess.

[laugh]

[woman screams]

[hinting]

Prince Ahmed: Out of my way, brats.

Aladdin: Hey! If I were as rich as you, I could afford good manners.

Prince Ahmed: Oh. I'll teach you manners!

[men laugh]

[grimace]

Aladdin: Look at that, Abu. It's not every day you see a horse with two hindquarters.

Audience: Whoa!

Prince Ahmed: Ha! You are a worthless street rat. You were born a street rat, you die a street rat and only your fleas cry for you.

Aladdin: I'm worthless. And I don't have fleas. [sighs] Come on, Abu. Let's go home.
♪ Riffraff, street rat. I don't buy it. If only they would take a closer look. Would they see the poor boy? No father. They see that I have so much more to offer. ♪
One day, Abu, things will change. We become rich, live in a palace and never have problems.

[roosters crow]

Prince Ahmed: I have never been so insulted.

Sultan: Oh Prince Ahmed. You're not leaving that early, are you?

Prince Ahmed: Good luck marrying her.

Sultan: Ah! Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine!

[murisee]

Sultan: Confuse it, Rajah. That's why Prince Ahmed stormed off.

Jasmine: Oh dad. Rajah was just playing with him.
Isn't that right, Rajah? You're just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Ahmed, aren't you?

[both laugh]

[clears throat]

Sultan: My dear, you must stop rejecting all the suitors who invite you. The law says...

Both: You must be married to a prince…

Sultan: Until your next birthday.

Jasmine: The law is bad.

Sultan: You only have three days left.

Jasmine: Dad, I hate this. If I get married, I want it to be for love.

Sultan: Jasmine...it's not just this law. I'm not going to be here forever, well, I... I just want to make sure you're taken care of. Anticipated.

Jasmine: Try to understand. I've never done anything myself. I never had real friends.

[waste]

Jasmine: Except you, Rajah. I never even left the palace walls.

Sultan: But Jasmine, you are a princess.

Jasmine: So maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore.

Sultan: Oooh! I...I...Allah forbids you from having daughters.

Diagram: Hmm?

Sultan: I don't know where he got it. His mother was not so difficult. I see! Ah, Jafar. My most trusted advisor. I desperately need your wisdom.

Jafar: My life is only to serve you, my lord.

Sultan: That's a matter for the suitors. Jasmine refuses to choose a man. I'm at the end of my thread.

Iago: Aha! End of the rope!

Sultan: [laughs] Oh! Have a cookie, pretty Polly.

Jafar: [Jafar laughs] Your majesty sure knows how to fool animals.

[Iago murisee]

Jafar: Now I may be able to guess the solution to this tricky problem.

Sultan: If anyone can help, it's you.

Jafar: But that would require using the Mystic Blue Diamond.

Sultan: Oops. Oh my ring? But it's been in the family for years.

Jafar: We need to find a suitor for the princess. Do not worry. Everything will be fine.

Sultan: Everything will be fine.

Jafar: The diamond.

Sultan: Here, Jafar. Everything you need is in order.

Jafar: You are very kind, liege. Now run around and play with your little toys, hmm?

Sultan: Yes. It's going to be pretty good.

Iago: [spits, coughs] I can't take it anymore! If I have to choke on one more of those disgusting moldy cookies... Bam! Hit!

Jafar: Calm down, Iago.

Iago: Then I seized his head. Hit!

Jafar: Soon I will be the Sultan, not this deranged idiot.

Iago: And then I shoved biscuits down his throat. Ha, ha!

[waste]

Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and live my life for me. I will miss you.

[waste]

Jasmine: Bye.

[salesmen call]

Aladdin: Okay, Abu. Go.

Melon Merchant: Try this. Your taste buds dance and sing.

[squeal]

Melon Merchant: Hands off of it.

[cocktail]

Melon Merchant: Well, you... Get out of here, you bloody dirty monkey!

Abu: Goodbye.

Aladdin: Well done, Abu.

[curse]

Aladdin: Breakfast is served.

Pot seller: Beautiful woman, buy a pot. There is no finer pot made of brass or silver.

Nut seller: Sweet dates. Sweet dates and figs. Sweet dates and pistachios.

Necklace seller: Should a woman wear a necklace? A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.

Fish seller: Fresh fish! We catch them, you buy them!

Jasmine: Well now. I do not believe. I see!

[swallow]

Jasmine: Sorry.

[takes a sip]

[burps]

Jasmine: I'm really, really sorry.

Aladdin: Wow.

Abu: Uh. Good morning? Good morning?

Jasmine: Oh, you must be hungry. Here is.

Apple Merchant: You better be able to pay for it.

Jasmine: Liver?

Apple Merchant: Now we steal from my cart.

Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I do not have money.

Apple salesman: Thief!

Jasmine: Please... If you let me go to the palace, I can get from the Sultan.

Apple Retailer: Do you know what the penalty is for theft?

Jasmine: Now! Now Thank you!

Aladdin: Thank you, good sir. I'm so glad you found it. I'm looking for you everywhere.

Jasmine: What are you doing?

Aladdin: Play the game.

Apple salesperson: And you, now, this girl?

Aladdin: Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister. He's a little crazy.

Apple salesman: He said he knew the Sultan.

Aladdin: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

Jasmine: Oh wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

[crap]

Aladdin: Tragic, right? But no harm is done. Come now, sister. It's time to go to the doctor.

Jasmine: Hello, Doctor. How's it going?

Aladdin: Now, now, now. Not this one. Come, Sultan.

[attacks, gasps]

Apple salesperson: Huh? What? Come back here, you little thieves!

[explosion]

Iago: With all due respect, your rat, can't we just wait for a real storm?

Jafar: Hold your breath, Iago. Faster.

Iago: Yes, O mighty Evil One. [flushes]

Jafar: Gone, the sands of time. Let me know who gets into the cave. Yeah! Yeah! Here it is. My diamond in the rough.

Iago: Is it he? Is this the clown we've been waiting for?

Jafar: Let's have the guards offer him an invitation to the palace, okay?

Iago: Great. [cough]

[sad laugh]

Aladdin: I'm almost there.

Jasmine: I want to thank you for stopping this man.

Aladdin: Forget it. So, this is your first time on the market, huh?

Jasmine: Is it that obvious?

Aladdin: Well, you stand out. I mean you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.

Jasmine: Hmm. I'm a quick learner.

Ash: Vau.

Aladdin: [laughs] Hello. Come on. Like this. Wow. Watch your head out there. Be careful.

Jasmine: Do you live here?

Aladdin: Yes. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.

Jasmine: That looks amazing.

Aladdin: Well, it's not much, but the view is amazing. Wow. The palace looks really amazing, doesn't it?

Jasmine: Oh, that's lovely.

Aladdin: I wonder what it would be like to live here, with servants and servants.

Jasmine: Of course. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.

Aladdin: It's better than here. You're always looking for food and dodging guards.

Jasmine: You are not free to make your own choices.

Aladdin: Sometimes you feel so...

Jasmine: You just...

Both: ...trapped.

Aladdin: [clears throat] So where are you from?

Jasmine: What does it matter? I ran away and I'm not coming back.

Aladdin: Really? How so?

Abu: Well you...

Jasmine: My father is forcing me to marry.

Aladdin: It's... it's terrible. Abu!

[sweats angrily]

Jasmine: What?

Aladdin: Abu says, uh... that's not fair.

Abu: What?

Jasmine: Oh, right?

Aladdin: Yes, of course.

Jasmine: And does Abu have anything else to say?

Aladdin: Well, he hopes he can do something to help him.

Abu: Oh boy.

Jasmine: Hmm. Tell him that's very nice.

Razoul: Oh well.

Both: They're after me! You?

Jasmine: My dad must have sent them...

Aladdin: Do you trust me?

Jasmine: What?

Aladdin: Do you trust me?

Jasmine: Yes ...

Aladdin: Then jump!

Razoul: We keep running into each other, don't we, street rat?

Aladdin: Run! Go! Out of here!

Razoul: Take it away from me! This is a dungeon for you, son.

Aladdin: Let me go.

Jasmine: Let him go.

Razoul: Look here, men. The mouse of the street!

[guards laugh]

Jasmine: Let him go at the princess's behest.

Razoul: Princess Jasmine.

Aladdin: A Princess?

Abu: Princess?

Razoul: What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat.

Jasmine: It's not your problem. Do as I say. Release him.

Razoul: I would, princess, except my orders come from Jafar. You should discuss this with him.

Jasmine: Believe me, I will. Jafar?

Jafar: Oh princess.

Iago: Aha! Jafar, I'm stuck.

Jafar: How may I be of your service?

Jasmine: The guards just took the boy to the market on your orders.

Jafar: Your father charged me with keeping the peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.

Jasmine: What was his crime?

Iago: I can't breathe, Jafar.

Jafar: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.

Iago: If you could only... Aah! It hurts!

Jasmine: He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

Jafar: Oh dear. Oh, how shocking. I had it, but I knew…

Jasmine: What do you mean?

Jafar: Unfortunately, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.

Jasmine: What sentence?

Jafar: Death.

[Jasmine broods]

Jafar: Mestatamamma.

Jasmine: Now.

Jafar: I'm very sorry, princess.

Jasmine: How could you? [tears]

Iago: [coughs] [coughs, gasps] So, how did it go?

Jafar: I think he took it pretty well.

Jasmine: [Jasmine cries] It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his name.

[Rajah whispers]

Aladdin: She was a princess. I can not believe it. I must have looked stupid to him.

Abu: Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Good morning!

Aladdin: Abu. Here.

[squeal]

Aladdin: Come on, help me out of here.

[punishment]

Aladdin: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, he was worth it.

Abu: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Aladdin: Don't worry. I will never see him again. I'm a street rat, remember? And there is a law. She must marry the prince. She deserves a prince.

Object: Wow!

Aladdin: I'm a fool.

Old Man Jafar: You're just a fool to give up, son.

Aladdin: Who are you?

Old Man Jafar: A humble prisoner like you. But together we can be more.

Aladdin: I'm listening.

Old Man Jafar: There is a cave, my son, a cave of wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams...

Abu: You!

Old Man Jafar: I bet there's enough treasure to even make your princess.

Iago: Jafar, can you hurry? I'm dying for this. [screams as Jafar punches him]

Aladdin: But the law says that only a prince can...

Old Man Jafar: You've heard of the Golden Rule, haven't you? Who owns the gold makes the rules. [squealing laughter]

Aladdin: Yeah. Why would you share all this wonderful treasure with me?

Old Man Jafar: I need young legs and a strong back to go.

Aladdin: The Problem. It is there. We are here.

Old Man Jafar: Uh. Things are not always what they seem. So, do we have a deal?

Abu: Oh, I don't know.

[thunder crashes]

Cave: Yeah. Who disturbs sleep?

Aladdin: It's me, Aladdin.

Cave: Continue. Do not touch anything other than the lamp.

Old Man Jafar: Remember, my son, go get me a lamp first, and you will have your reward.

Aladdin: Come on, Abu.

[squeal]

Aladdin: Would you like to watch it!

[waste]

Aladdin: Just a handful of these things would make me richer than the Sultan. Abu!

[white]

Aladdin: Don't... touch... anything. We need to find this lamp.

Abu: [growls] Huh? Aladdin!

Aladdin: Abu, will you stop him?

[yell]

Aladdin: Abu, what are you crazy? A magic carpet. Come on. Go out. We're not going to hurt you.

[yell]

Aladdin: Hey, take it easy, Abu. He's not going to bite. THANK YOU.

[squeal]

Aladdin: Hello. Wait a moment. Do not go. Maybe you can help us. Hey! Wow! Look, we're trying to find this lamp. I think he knows where it is.

[squeals excitedly]

[echoes]

Aladdin: [whispers] Wait here.

Abu: [moaning] Oh!

Aladdin: That's it. This is why we came here... Abu! NOW!

Cave: Infidels!

Ash: Ohh.

Cave: You have touched the forbidden treasure! From now on, you will never see the light of day again!

Aladdin: Wow!

Abou: Help! Help! Help!

Aladdin: I got you! Wow. Mat, let's move. Abu! Abu, it's time to panic. Start panicking.

Both: Wow!

[Out of breath]

[cracks of thunder]

[roar]

Aladdin: Help me.

Old Man Jafar: Throw me the lamp.

Aladdin: I can't take it. Give me your hand.

Old Man Jafar: First give me the lamp. [maniacal laughter] Yes! finally! [laugh]

Aladdin: [Aladdin struggles] What are you doing?

Old Man Jafar: I will give you your reward. [Old Man Jafar's voice reverts to normal Jafar's voice] Your eternal reward. [Abu then bites his hand, then screams]

[yell]

[roars as cave collapses]

Jafar: [laughs] It's mine. [removes his mask] It's all mine. I... Where is he? Now... NOOOOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!!!!

Sultan: Jasmine? Oh my darling. What's wrong?

Jasmine: [sniffs] Jafar... did something terrible.

Sultan: There, there, my dear. We'll make things right. Now tell me everything.

Abu: Oops. Aladdin. Wake up. Aladdin.

Aladdin: Ah! My head. They were trapped. This two-faced jackal boy! Whoever it was, he's long gone with that lamp.

Abu: Yes!

Aladdin: [laughs] Well, you little furry thief. It looks like decrepit, worthless scrap metal.
Hi, I think there is something written here, but it's hard to understand.

Genie: Wow! Hey! 10,000 years gives you such a stiff neck. Wait a minute. Wow! WOW!!! Does it feel good to be outside?
I tell you, I'm glad to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hey. Where do you come from? What is your name?

Aladdin: Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

Genie: Aladdin. Hello Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you "Ali"? Or maybe just "Din". And "Laddie"?
They'd say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."
Aladdin: I must have hit my head harder than I thought.

Genie: Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do? [laughs] Oh, sorry, Cheetah. I hope I didn't burn the fur. Oh, Rugman. I haven't seen you in a few millennia.
Give me the pompom. Yeah. Uh huh. Say you are much smaller than my former master. Either that or I gained weight. Look aside.
Do I look different to you?

Aladdin: Wait a minute. Am I your master?

Genie: Exactly. He may be educated. What would you wish for me? Always impressive, long content, often imitated but never copied... [echo]
Duplicated, duplicated... Genius... Lamp! Here, straight from the lamp, right here to make your fondest wishes come true. THANK YOU.

Aladdin: Wow. Wish fulfillment?

Genie: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-no for wishing for more wishes. That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres. Now exchanges, exchanges or returns.

Aladdin: Now I know I'm dreaming.

Genie: Master, I don't think you really understand what you have here! So why not just ruminate while I illuminate the possibilities. ♪

From now on you must discuss with me the sentencing of the prisoners before their heads are beheaded.

Jafar: I assure you, Your Highness, this will not happen again.

Sultan: Jasmine...Jafar. Now let's put all this complexity behind us. Please.

Jafar: My apologies, princess.

Jasmine: At least it's something good if I'm forced to marry. When I'm queen, I have the power to get rid of you.

[Jafar laughs nervously]

Sultan: That's nice. So everything was agreed. Now, Jasmine, back to this suitor thing... Jasmine? Jasmine!

Aladdin: Ah, now. I never wanted to leave the cave. You did it alone.

Genie: [jaw drops] Well, I'm feeling fuzzy. Alright baaad boy, but now no more presents.

Aladdin: A fair deal. Three wishes, then. I want them to be good. What would you like to?

Genie: Me? I've been asked that before. Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Now I can't. I...

Aladdin: Come in. Tell me.

Genius: Freedom.

Aladdin: Are you a prisoner?

Genie: This is all part of the whole genie gig. Phenomenal cosmic forces... A very small living space.

Aladdin: I will. I will set you free.

Genie: Uh-huh, yeah, it is.

Aladdin: Now, really, I promise. After making my first two wishes, I will use my third wish to set you free.

Genie: Well, I hope so. Clear. Let's make magic! So what is it? What do you want most?

Aladdin: Well, there's this girl.

Genius: Wrong. I can't make anyone fall in love, remember?

Aladdin: Oh, but Genie, he's smart and funny and...

Genie: Beautiful?

Sultan: But Jasmine hated all these suitors. How can I choose someone he hates?

Sultan: Steep.

Jafar: "You must marry a princess..." Hmm... Interesting...

Sultan: What? WHO?

Jafar: I don't trust him, sir.

Sultan: This is absurd. One thing I pride myself on, Jafar, is that I am an excellent judge of character.

Iago: Oh, excellent judge. Of course. No!

Sultan: Jasmine likes this.

Aladdin: And I'm pretty sure I like Princess Jasmine.

Jafar: Your highness, now. I have to speak for Jasmine. This boy is no different. What makes him think he's worthy of a princess?

Aladdin: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa. Let him meet me. I will win your daughter.

Jasmine: How dare you. You all. Will I be left to decide my future? I am not a prize to be won.

Sultan: Oh dear. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Give Jasmine time to calm down.

Jafar: I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince Abooboo.

Genie: Go then. Hey. It's a good decision. I can not believe it. I lose to all-in.

Aladdin: Genie, I need help.

Genie: All right, Sparky, here's the deal. If you want to avenge the little lady, you have to be a genius. Did you get it?

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Tell him the truth!

Aladdin: No way. If Jasmine found out I really was a dirty street rat, she would make fun of me.

Genius: A woman appreciates a man who can laugh. Al, kidding aside, you really should be yourself.

Aladdin: Hey, that's the last thing I want to be. Okay, I'll go see him. I... I have to be smooth, cool, confident. How do I look?

Genie: Like a prince.

SO. It couldn't have been the me you met.

Jasmine: No, I guess not.

Jasmine: Punctual?

Genie: Sorry.

Aladdin: Uh, beautiful.

Genius: Nice healing.

Jasmine: Hmm. I'm rich too, you know.

Aladdin: Yeah.

Jasmine: Daughter of the Sultan.

Aladdin: I know.

Jasmine: A great reward for any prince who marries.

Aladdin: That's true. PROPERLY. A prince like me.

Genie: Watch out! Warning!

Jasmine: That's true. A prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, cheeky peacock I've ever met.

Genie: May Day! Help!

Jasmine: Go jump off the balcony!

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Stop him. Stop him! Do you want me to poke him?

Aladdin: Off.

Genie: Okay, great. But remember the "bee" itself.

Aladdin: Yeah, that's true.

Jasmine: What?

Aladdin: Uh... Uh, you're right. [sighs] You're not just a prize to be won. You should be free to make your own choices. I'll go now.

Jasmine: Now!

Aladdin: What? What?

Jasmine: How... How do you do that?

Aladdin: It's a flying carpet.

Jasmine: That's lovely.

[Matto "kisses" her hand]

Aladdin: You, uh... You don't want to go for a ride? We could leave the palace and see the world.

Jasmine: Is it safe?

Aladdin: Of course. Do you trust me?

Jasmine: What?

Aladdin: Do you trust me?

Jasmine: Yes.

Aladdin: Jasmine, I'm sorry.

Jasmine: Did you think I was stupid?

Aladdin: Now.

Jasmine: Wouldn't that be enough?

Jasmine: Who are you? Tell the truth.

Aladdin: The truth. Truth. Um... The truth is... Sometimes I dress like a regular, uh... to escape the pressures of palace life. But I really am a prince.

Jasmine: Why didn't you tell me?

Aladdin: Well, you know... royalty going to town in disguise seems a bit odd, doesn't it?

Jasmine: Hmm. Not so weird. Good night, handsome prince.

Aladdin: Sleep well, princess. [sigh] Yes! [sighs] For the first time in my life, things are starting to go well.

[screams, struggles]

Aladdin: Hey! [mute] Abu. Abu.

Guard: Hold him.

Jafar: I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo.

Aladdin: [muted] Why, you...

Jafar: Make sure he's never found.

[laugh]

Genius: Never fail. Take a bath and wash the lamp. Good morning? Al? [gasps] Al! Kid, stop it.
You can't fake this. I can't help you unless you wish. You have to say, "Genius, I want you to save my life. " Got it?
Clear! Come on, Aladdin! I'll take it. [alarm simulation] Increase range. [speaking German]

[cough]

Genie: Don't scare me like that.

Aladdin: Genie, I... I... Thank you, Genie.

Genie: Oh Al. I'm starting to like you, boy. Not that I want to choose curtains or anything.

[squeals]

Sultan: Jasmine.

Jasmine: Oh, Dad, I just had the most amazing time. I am so happy.

Sultan: You should be, Jasmine. I chose a man for you.

Jasmine: What?

Sultan: You will marry Jafar.

[flushes]

Jafar: You're speechless, I see. A great quality in a wife.

Jasmine: I will never marry you. Dad, I choose Prince Ali.

Jafar: Prince Ali is gone.

Aladdin: You better check your crystal ball again, Jafar.

Jasmine: Prince Ali!

[flushes]

Iago: What do you mean... er. Ouch!

Aladdin: Tell him the truth, Jafar. You tried to kill me.

Jafar: What? Ridiculous, absurd, Your Highness. He is clearly lying.

Sultan: Obviously a liar.

Jasmine: Dad, what's wrong with you?

Aladdin: I know what's wrong.

(Aladdin breaks Jafar's snake staff)

Sultan: Oh my God!

Aladdin: Your Highness. Jafar controls you with this.

Sultan: [stutters] What? Jafar? You traitor!

Jafar: Your Majesty, this can all be explained.

Sultan: Guards! Guards!

Iago: Well, that's all. They were dead. Forget it. Just dig a grave for both of us. They were dead.

Sultan: Arrest Jafar immediately.

[in trouble]

Jafar: It's not done yet, son. [laugh]

[cough]

Sultan: Find him! Search everywhere!

Aladdin: Jasmine, are you okay?

Jasmine: Yes.

Sultan: Jafar, my most trusted advisor, has been plotting against me all this time. It's horrible, just horrible. How am I going to... Huh?
Could this be true? Has my daughter finally chosen a suitor? Ha, ha! Praise Allah! You brilliant boy, I could kiss you. I will not do it. I'll leave it to my...
But you get married at the same time. Yes Yes. And you will be happy and prosperous, and then you, my son, will become my Sultan.

Aladdin: The Sultan?

Sultan: Yes. An honest young man like you, a person of impeccable moral character, that's what this kingdom is all about.

Iago: We have to get out of here. We have to get out. I have to start packing Your Highness. Only essentials.
We must travel light and bring guns, guns, knives, and what do you think of this picture? I don't know, I think I'm making a weird face with it.

[maniacal laughter]

Iago: Oh boy. It's broken. He went crazy. Jafar! Jafar! Hold on! Good adhesion.

Jafar: Prince Ali is nothing but that ragged boy, Aladdin. He has a lamp, Iago.

Iago: Well, this wretched...

Jafar: But you free him.

Iago: Me?

Aladdin: The Sultan? They want me to be their sultan?

Genie: Huzzah! ♪ Hail to the conquering hero! ♪ [♪ Stars and Stripes Forever plays] Aladdin, you have just won the heart of a princess. What are you going to do next?

[deep sigh]

Genie: [whispering] Psst. Your phrase is: "I release the genie." Whenever.

Aladdin: Genius, I can't.

Genie: Of course you can. You just say: "Genius, I wish you freedom. »

Aladdin: I'm serious! Look, I'm sorry. I'm really! But they want to make me Sultan. No, they want to make Prince Ali Sultan. Without you I'm just Aladdin.

Genie: Al, you win.

Aladdin: Because of you! The only reason people think I'm worth anything is because of you! What if they find out I'm not really a prince?
What if Jasmine found out? i would lose it. Genius, I can't do this alone. I cannot wish you freedom.

Genie: Very good. I understand. However. You lied to everyone. Hey, I'm starting to feel left out. Now will you excuse me, master.

[sighs]

Aladdin: Genie, I'm so sorry.

[raspberry]

Aladdin: Well, very good! So... hang in there! What are you watching?

[moans, sniffs]

Aladdin: Look, I... I'm sorry. Abu, I'm sorry. I'm not waiting. Come on. [sigh] What do I do? [sigh] Genie is right. I have to tell Jasmine the truth.

Jasmine: Ali. Oh Ali. Are you coming here?

Aladdin: [sighs] Well, there we go. Jasmine? Where are you?

Iago: [imitating Jasmine] At the Menagerie. Hurry up.

Aladdin: I'm coming.

Iago: Got a problem, Pinky? Jerk. [good snicker] Boy, Jafar is glad to see you. [imitating Jafar] Great job, Iago. Jack.
[imitating Jafar] Not really. On a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven. Oh Jafar, you are so kind. I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

Sultan: People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor.

[crowd cheers]

Aladdin: Jasmine.

Jasmine: Ali, where have you been?

Aladdin: Jasmine, I have something to tell you.

Jasmine: The whole kingdom was present at the Father's revelation.

Aladdin: No. But Jasmine, listen to me. You do not understand...

Jasmine: Good luck.

Sultan: Ali Ababwa!

Aladdin: Oh boy.

[applause]

Iago: Now look at them, they're cheering that little idiot!

Jafar: Let them clap...

Genie: You know, Al, I can really...! I don't think you're him. Tonight, the role of Ali is played by a tall, dark and gloomy man.

Jafar: I am your master now!

Genie: I was afraid of it.

Jafar: Genie, grant me my first wish. I want to rule on high as a sultan!

Aladdin: Wow!

Sultan: Bless my soul. What is this? What? What is this? What is happening? Oh my god, what's going on?

Jasmine: Dad!

Jafar [laughs] (Jafar turns into Sultan)

Sultan: Jafar, you vile traitor!

Jasmine: We will never bow to you!

Iago: Why am I not surprised?!

Jafar: If you don't bow to the Sultan, you bow to the wizard!! Genie, my second wish... I want to be the most powerful wizard in the world!

Sultan: That is true. You have certainly proven your worth in my opinion. This law creates a problem.

Jasmine: Dad?

Sultan: Well, am I a Sultan or am I a Sultan? From this day on, the princess will marry whomever she deems worthy.

Jasmine: He. I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.

I never had real friends.

I've never even been there

But Jasmine, you are a princess.
So maybe I don't want to

Oooh! me me...
Allah forbids you to do so

Hmm?
I don't know where he got it from.
His mother was not so picky.
I see! Ah, Jafar.
My most trusted advisor.
I desperately need your wisdom.
My life is only to serve you, my lord.
That's the suitors' business.
Jasmine refuses
choose a husband.
- I'm at the end of my nerves.
- Oh okay ! End of the rope!
I see!
Have a cookie, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty absolutely
reasonable with stupid animals.
NOW,
maybe i can guess the solution
to this difficult problem.
If anyone can help, it's you.
But this would require some use
of the mystical blue diamond.
I see. Oh my ring?
But it's been in the family for years.
We have to find out
princess suitor.
Do not worry.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.
Diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Everything you need is in order.
You are very kind, my lord.
Now run and play
with your little toys, huh?
Yeah. It's going to be pretty good.
I can not take it anymore !
If I have to choke one more time
those moldy, disgusting cookies...
Boom! Hit!
Calm down, Lago.
Then I grabbed her head.
Hit!
Soon I will be a Sultan,
not this stupid idiot.
And then I fill with cookies
in his throat.
Haha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can't stay here
and let my life live for me.
I will miss you.
Hey Hey.
Okay, Abu. Go.
Try it. Your taste buds
dances and sings.
Get your paw off of it.
Why you...
Out of here,
you damned dirty monkey!
Hey Hey.
Well done Abu.
Breakfast will be served.
Beautiful woman, buy a pot.
There is no finer pot made of brass or silver.
Sugar dates.
Sweet dates and figs.
Sweet dates and pistachios.
Would a woman like a necklace?
A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.
Fresh fish!
We catch them, you buy them!
Oh no. I do not believe.
I see!
Sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
Wow.
Oh no.
Good morning. Good morning?
Oh, you must be hungry.
Here is.
You better be able to pay for it.
Pay?
No one steals my basket.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I do not have money.
- The powers!
- Please...
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get from Sultan.
you know what
is there a penalty for theft?
No! No thanks!
Thank you sir.
I'm so glad you found it.
I'm looking for you everywhere.
- What are you doing?
- Play a game.
Do you know this girl?
Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister.
He's a little crazy.
He said he knew the Sultan.
He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?
Tragic, right?
But no harm is done.
Come now, sister.
It's time to go to the doctor.
Hello, Doctor.
How's it going?
- No no no. Not this one.
- Come, Sultan.
Eh. What?
Come back here, you little thieves!
With all due respect,
Your rottenness,
can't we just wait
for the right storm?
Save your breath, Lago. Faster.
Yes, oh mighty Evil.
Gone, the sands of time.
Reveal it to me
who can enter the cave.
Yeah! Yeah!
Here it is.
My diamond in the rough.
It's him. It's a clown
Did we wait?
Let the guards get on with it
an invitation to the palace, okay?
Swell.
Almost there.
I want to thank you
for arresting this man.
Forget it.
So this is your first time
in the market, huh?
Is it that obvious?
Well, you stand out.
I mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.
Hmmm, I'm a fast learner.
Wow.
Hey.
Come on. Like this.
Wow. Watch your head out there.
Be careful.
Do you live here?
Yeah. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.
This looks amazing.
Well, it's not much,
but it has a great view.
Wow. The palace looks
Pretty surprising, huh?
Oh, that's wonderful.
I wondered what it would be like
it's like i lived there
and they have servants and servants.
Oh, of course. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.
It's better than here.
You are always looking for food
and dodge the guards.
You are not free to do
your own choices.
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...
...ansa.
So where are you from?
What does it matter?
I ran away
and I'm not going back.
Really. How so?
Why you...
My father forces me
get married.
It's... it's terrible.
Abu!
What?
Abu says…
it's not fair.
What?
- Is that right?
- Of course.
Ja Abu
do you have anything else to say?
Well, he wishes he had
something he could do to help.
Oh no.
Hmm.
Tell him it's very nice.
There you are.
- They're after me! You?
- My father must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
- Joo...
So jump!
We keep crossing paths,
Aren't you, street rat?
Run! Go! Out of here!
Take this thing away from me!
- This is a dungeon for you, son.
- Let me go.
Let him go.
- Look here, men. Street mouse.
Let it be,
on the princess's orders.
Princess Jasmine.
- Princess?
- Princess?
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.
It's not your problem.
Do as I say. Release him.
i will princess
except my orders come from Jafar.
- You need to discuss it with him.
- Believe me, I will.
Jafar?
Oh princess.
Ouch! Jafar, I'm stuck.
How can I be of help to you?
The guards just took the boy
of your order.
Your father blamed me
in maintaining peace in Agrabah.
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?
I can't breathe, Jafar.
Why by kidnapping the princess,
Of course.
If only you could...
Ah! It hurts!
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.
Ohhh.
Oh, how shocking.
If I would have known...
What do you mean?
Alas, the verdict of the boy
has already been completed.
What sentence?
Death.
- By beating.
- No.
I'm very sorry, princess.
How are you?
So how did it go?
I think he took it pretty well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
- I didn't even know his name.
She was a princess.
I can not believe it.
I must have looked
so stupid for him.
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!
Good morning!
Abu. Here.
Come on, help me out of this.
Hey, he was in trouble.
Ah, he was worth it.
Yeah yeah yeah
Do not worry.
I will never see him again.
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there is a law.
She must marry the prince.
- He deserves a prince.
- Da-da!
I'm stupid.
You're just a fool
if you give up son
Who are you?
A humble prisoner like you.
But together,
maybe we can be more.
I'm listening.
There is a cave, my son,
cave of wonders,
full of treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.
Ooh!
A treasure that is even enough to impress
your princess i bet.
Jafar, can you hurry?
I'm dying for this.
But the law says that only a prince can...
You've heard of the golden rule,
Is not it ?
He who has gold
makes the rules.
Why are you sharing all this
lovely treasure with me?
I need a young pair of legs and
strong back to chase him.
One problem.
It is there.
We are here.
Um. Things are not always
what they look like.
SO...
do we have a contract
Oh, I don't know.
Who disturbs sleep?
It's me, Aladdin.
Proceed.
Do not touch anything other than the lamp.
remember my son
first bring me the lamp
and then you have to
get your reward.
Come on, Abu.
Can you watch this!
Just a handful of these things
would make me richer than the Sultan.
Abu!
Don't... touch... anything.
We need to find this lamp.
Eh?
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you stop him?
Abu what are you crazy?
A magic carpet.
Come on. Go out.
We're not going to hurt you.
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not going to bite.
THANK YOU.
Wait a moment. Do not go.
Maybe you can help us.
Hey! Wow!
You see, we try
to find this lamp.
I think he knows where it is.
Wait here.
I see!
That's it?
This is what we came for
all the way here...
Abu! They!
- Infidels!
- Oh no.
You touched
forbidden treasure!
Now you'll never do it again
see the day!
Wow!
Car! Car! Car!
I got you!
Mat, let's move.
Abu!
Abu, now is not the time to panic.
Start panicking.
Wow!
- Help me.
- Throw me a lamp.
I can not take it.
Give me your hand.
Give me the lamp first.
Joo!
finally!
What are you doing?
Give you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
It's mine.
It's all mine.
I... where is he?
No.
No!
Jasmine?
Oh my darling.
What's wrong?
Jafar has...
did something terrible.
There, there, my love.
We'll make things right.
Now tell me everything.
I see.
Aladdin. Wake up.
Aladdin.
I see! My head.
They were trapped.
This two-faced jackal boy!
whoever he is
he has been away for a long time with that lamp.
Ah!
Well, you hairy little thief.
It looks like a beating,
worthless garbage.
Hi, I think so
something written here
but it's hard to understand.
Aaaaahhhhh!
Hey!
, the years will give you
such a stiff neck.
Wait a minute.
Wow! Wow!
Does it feel good?
be out of there.
Nice to be back,
Ladies and gentlemen.
Hey. Where do you come from?
What is your name?
Er... Er, Aladdin.
Aladdin. Hello Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you "Ali"?
Or maybe just "Din".
Ja "Laddie"?
They'd say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.
Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do?
Sorry Cheetah.
I hope I didn't burn the fur.
Oh, Rugman. I did not see you
in a few millennia.
Give me the pompom.
Yoo. Eh eh.
Say you are much smaller
as my last master.
Or maybe I'll get bigger.
Look aside. Do I look different?
Wait a moment.
Am I your master?
Properly. He may be educated.
What would you wish for me?
Always impressive,
long content,
often imitated,
but never copied...
Copied, duplicated...
Nero...
light up!
Here, straight from the lamp,
here for you
a lot of wish fulfillment.
THANK YOU.
Wow. Wish fulfillment?
Three wishes to be careful.
And ix-no to wish
for more wishes.
That's it. Three.
One two three.
No exchanges,
exchanges or returns.
Now I know I'm dreaming.
Master, I don't think you really understand
what do you have here
So why not just ruminate
when I shine
potential.
#Well, Ali Baba had these thieves#
#Scheherazade had a thousand stories#

Eh?
So what will it be, master?
You give me
three wishes what i want right?
Oh, almost.
There are some reservations,
some allowances.
Like?
Ah, rule number one:
I can't kill anyone.
So don't ask.
Rule number two.
I can't make anyone
fall in love with someone else.
You're a little punisher there.
Rule number three. I can't bring
people come back from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing that.
Otherwise, there you have it.
- Hmm.
- I see!
Reservations?
Do you mean boundaries?
based on wishes?
An almighty genius.
I can't even bring people
back from the dead.
I don't know, Abu. It probably is
I can't even get us out of this cave.
Looks like we have to
find a way out.
Sorry?
Are you looking at me?
Are you rubbing my lamp?
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?
And you cheated on me?
I do not believe,
not right away.
You will get your wish,
so sit down!
- In an emergency,
the exits are here, here,
here, here, wherever.
Hold hands and arms
inside the carpet.
Were you...
out of here!
Jafar, it's a scandal.
If it weren't for all your years
good and loyal service...
From now on, we need to discuss
judging prisoners with me,
before their heads were beheaded.
I assure you, Your Highness,
this will not happen again.
Jasmine...
Jafar. Let's put everything
complicated matters behind us.
Please.
My apologies and most humble apologies
you too, princess.
At least something good will come
that I was forced to marry.
When I'm queen, I get
strength to get rid of you.
It's good.
So everything was agreed.
Now, Jasmine, let's get back to it
this suitor thing...Jasmine?
Jasmine!
I wish I had this lamp.
“I have power
get rid of you. »
To think
we have to keep kissing
to this idiot
and his stupid daughter
- the rest of our lives...
- No, Lake.
Only until he finds
stupid husband
Then he gets us a banana.
Or were beaten.
Wow!
I see. Wait a moment.
Jafar. And if you were
idiot husband?
What?
Okay, you're getting married
princess, okay?
And then you
to become a sultan.
I see.
Marry a snot.
I will be the Sultan.
- The idea is meritorious.
- Yes, it deserves it. Yeah.
And then we let the stepfather down
and the little woman on the edge of the cliff.
Joo !
Christmas plate!
I like the way
your dirty little mind works.
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.
Don't stand by the mat
has completely stopped.
THANK YOU.
Goodbye now. Good yes.
THANK YOU.
Well, how about this,
M. Do you suspect Mustafa?
Oh, you showed me that well.
Now for my three wishes.
Are my ears failing me?
Three. You're one point behind, son.
Oh no. I never really hoped
to get out of the cave.
You did it alone.
Well, I feel stupid.
All right you baaad boy
but no more gifts.
Fair trade.
Three wishes, then.
I want them to be good.
What would you like to?
I?
No one has ever asked me that before.
Well in my case...
Ah, forget it.
- What?
- No, I can't. I...
Come on. Tell me.
Freedom.
Are you a prisoner?
All of this is an essential part
the whole genius concert.
Phenomenal Cosmic Powers...
Very small living space.
Genius, this is terrible.
But oh, to be free.
No need to go there
"Huh huh. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"
To be my own master.
That would be it
greater than all magic
and all the treasures
In the whole world.
But what am I talking about?
Let's be real here.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
Genius, wake up and smell the hummus.
Why not?
The only way to get out
if my master wants me to go.
So you can guess how often
it happened.
I will do it. I will set you free.
- Uh-huh, that's true.
- Not really, I promise.
after my first two wishes,
I use my third wish
to set you free.
Well, I hope so.
Clear.
Let's make magic.
So what is it?
What do you want most?
Well, there's this girl.
Fake.
I can't make anyone
falling in love, remember?
But, genius,
he's smart and funny and...
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.
He has these eyes that...
and that hair. Wow.
And her smile...
Am I.
It's love.
But she is a princess.
To even have a chance,
I should be...
Hey, can you make me a prince?
Let's see here.
Royal chicken? No.
Alaskan king crab.
Ouch. I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad. Ah!
And you, Brute. No.
Haha. "Make a prince."
Is this an official wish?
Say the magic words.
Genius, I wish you
make me a prince
Clear!
Eh heh! Frame! Frame!
First, this Fez and vest combination
it is too third century.
These corrections.
What are we trying to say, beggar?
No, let's work with me here.
Oops. I like this. Very macho.
Now he needs something else.
What does that tell me?
It's about the means of transportation.
Sorry, little monkey.
Whom. Like this.
- Oh no.
- Well, here he is.
What better way to make your own
entering the streets of Agrabah
like riding alone
a new camel.
Attention. They spit.
Mmmm. Not enough.
It's still not enough.
Wait and see.
What do you need?
Joo!
Esalalumbo Shimin Dumbo.
Wow!
Talk about your trunk.
Check this function.
Abu, you look good.
He has an outfit.
He has an elephant.
But we're not done yet.
Hold on to your turban, son.
We will make you a star.
Sir i found the solution
your daughter's problem.
Alright. The problem with your daughter.
Really?
Here.
“If the princess has not chosen
husband at an agreed time,
so the Sultan must
complain to him. »
But Jasmine hated
all these suitors.
How could I choose
someone he hates?
Don't worry, sir.
There's more.
“if in the event
we can't find a suitable prince"
Jerk.
"Then the princess must marry..."
Hmm. Interesting.
What? WHO?
Royal Visor.
Well, that would be... me.
But I thought the law said
that only the prince
can marry a princess.
I am pretty sure...
Desperate times call
desperate measures, my lord.
Yeah. Desperate measures.
You will order
princess marry me
I order...
Princess...
on...
But you are so old.
The princess will marry me.
The princess is getting married...
- What. What is this?
This music.
Jafar, you must come
and look at this.

Absolutely awesome.
Your Highness,
I have traveled far and wide
seek your daughter's hand.
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Of course.
Nice to meet you.
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He is also happy.
Ecstatic.
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
-Above.
Forget it.
You can't just roll here
uninvited and waiting...
Allah, it definitely is
remarkable device.
Wake up.
I don't think I could...
Of course, Your Majesty.
I can.
Sir, I must advise you not to do this.
Shut up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.
AIE AIE AIE.
Ahhh! Wow!
Where did you say
where were you from
Oh, much further than
you've traveled, I'm sure.
- Try me.
- Be careful, Polly.
Hey, check this out.
Look at him with that stupid carpet.
Ah!
Huh huh!
Out of the way.
I'm coming to the country.
Jafar, look at this.
- Impressive, Your Highness.
- It was wonderful.
Yes, it seems to me
have talent for it.
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince at that.
If we're lucky, you won't
I must eventually marry Jasmine.
- I don't trust him, sir.
- It's absurd.
I am proud of one thing, Jafar,
I am an excellent judge of character.
Oh, excellent judge.
Of course. No!
Jasmine likes this.
And I'm pretty sure
I would like Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no.
I have to speak for Jasmine.
This boy is no different
other.
Which makes him think
Is she worthy of a princess?
Your Highness,
I am Prince Ali Ababwa.
Let him meet me.
I will win your daughter.
How dare you.
You all. Standing
decide my future?
I am not a prize to be won.
Ohhh.
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Give Jasmine time
cool.
I think it's time to say goodbye
to Prince Abouboo.
What do I do?
Jasmine doesn't even do that
let me talk to him.
I should have known I couldn't get away with this
this stupid prince wishes.
So get moving.
Hey.
It's a good decision.
I can not believe it.
I lose to all-in.
Genius, I need help.
All right, Sparky,
here's the deal.
If you want to go to court
little lady,
you must be
straight shooter.
- Did you get it?
- What?
Tell him...
-...truth!
- Not at all.
If Jasmine found out I really am
dirty street rat,
he would laugh at me.
A woman appreciates a man
who makes him laugh.
Al, kidding aside,
you should really be yourself.
Hey, that's the last thing I want to be.
Okay, I'll go see him.
I just... I have to be gentle,
cool, confident.
How do I look?
Like a prince.
Princess Jasmine?
- Who's here?
- It's me, Prince Ali.
Hmm. Oh, Prince Ali Ababwa.
I do not want to see you.
No, no, please, princess.
Give me a chance.
- Leave me alone.
- Down, cat.
How is our little friend?
Good cat, take it away.
Alas, kitty.
Wait. Wait.
I know you?
No. No.
You remind me of something
I met at the market.
Market?
I have servants who go
to the market for me.
Well, I even have servants who visit
my servant's market.
You met not me.
No, I guess not.
Enough of you, Casanova.
Talk about him.
He is smart, funny,
hair, eyes.
Nothing. Select a feature.
Hmm. Princess Jasmine?
You are very...
- Wonderful, wonderful, precise.
-...precise.
- Punctual?
- Sorry.
- Um, beautiful.
- Get well soon.
Hmm.
I'm rich too, you know.
- Joo.
- The Sultan's daughter.
I know.
Great price
for the prince to marry.
That is true. PROPERLY.
A prince like me.
Warning! Warning!
PROPERLY. A prince like you.
And all the other sweatshirts,
a fluttering peacock I met.
Car! Car!
Just jump
balcony!
- What?
- Stop him. Stop him!
- Do you want me to poke him?
- Go out.
OK very good.
But remember the "bee" itself.
- Really.
- What?
Er... Er, you're right.
You're not just
prize to be won.
You should be free
make your own choice.
I'll go now.
- No!
- What? What?
How...
How do you do this?
- It's a flying carpet.
- It is wonderful.
You...
You don't want to go
let's go, right?
We could leave the palace,
see the world.
- Is it safe?
- Of course. Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
Joo.
Joo.

Annoyance
Abu must have missed this.
No. He hates fireworks.
He doesn't like to fly either.
That is...
Oh no.
You are a boy from the market.
I knew it.
- Why did you lie?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.
- That I wouldn't understand?
- No.
I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.
Who are you?
Tell the truth.
Truth?
Truth. Um...
The truth is...
Sometimes I dress like normal...
escape pressure
of palace life.
But I really am a prince.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, you know...
royalty will come out
in the city in disguise,
feels a little weird
you do not believe?
Hmm.
Not so weird.
Good night, handsome prince.
Sleep well, princess.
Joo!
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go well.
Ashes. Ashes.
Keep it.
I'm afraid you're exhausted
welcome, prince Abooboo.
Why you...
Make sure it's never found.
Never fail. Take a bath
and there is a problem with the lamp.
Good morning? Al?
Al! Kid, stop it.
You can't fake this.
I can't help you unless you wish.
You must say, "Genius,
I want you to save my life.” Do you understand?
Come on, Aladdin!
I'll take it.
Superior reach.
Don't scare me like that.
Genius, I...
I...
- Thanks, Genie.
- You Al.
I'm starting to like you, boy.
It's not that I want to choose
curtains or something.
Jasmine.
Oh dad, I just had
the most wonderful moment.
- I am so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.
I chose a man for you.
- What?
- You will marry Jafar.
You are speechless, I see.
A great quality in a wife.
I will never marry you.
- Dad, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali is gone.
Better check yours
another crystal ball, Jafar.
Prince Ali!
How... um. Ouch!
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to kill me.
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.
He is clearly lying.
Obviously lying.
Dad, what's wrong with you?
I know what's wrong.
Oh no!
Jafar controls you with this.
What? Jafar?
You traitor!
Your Highness,
all this can be explained.
Guards! Guards!
Well, that's it.
They were dead. Forget it.
Just dig a grave for both of us.
They were dead.
Terminate Jafar immediately.
It's not done yet, son.
Etsi se!
- Search everywhere!
-Jasmine, are you okay?
Joo.
Jafar, my most trusted advisor,
been plotting against me all this time.
It's horrible, just horrible.
How could I ever...
Eh?
Could this be true?
My daughter finally
chose a suitor?
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.
I will not do it.
I'll leave it to my...
But you get married at the same time.
Yes Yes. And you will be happy
and prosperous,
and then you, my son,
will be the Sultan.
-Sultan?
- Joo.
A handsome, honest young man
like you,
your person
impeccable moral character
This is exactly what this kingdom needs.
We have to get out of here.
Gotta start packing.
Only essentials.
We must travel light.
Bring the guns, the guns,
and what do you think of this picture?
I think I'll make a weird face with it.
Oh no. It's broken.
He went crazy.
Jafar! Jafar!
Hold on!
Good adhesion.
Prince Ali is nothing but
that ragged boy, Aladdin.
- He has a lamp, Lago.
- Well, this poor...
But you will
to release him.
I?
Sultan?
They want me to be their sultan?
Huzzah!
#Hail to the Conquering Hero#
Aladdin, you just won
princess heart
What are you going to do next?
Psst Your line is,
"I'm going to let life go."
Whenever.
- Genius. I can not.
- Of course you can.
Go forward,
"Genius, I wish you freedom."
I'm serious.
Look, I'm sorry. I'm really.
But they want to make me Sultan.
No, they want to do
Prince Ali Sultan.
Without you,
I'm just Aladdin.
- Al, you win.
- Because of you.
The only reason we think
I'm worth everything, it's because of you.
And if they find out
Am I really not a prince?
What if Jasmine found out?
i would lose it.
Genius, I can't
keep it to myself.
I cannot wish you freedom.
GOOD. I understand.
You lied to everyone.
Hey, I'm starting to feel left out.
Now will you excuse me, master.
Genius, I'm so sorry.
GOOD.
So hang in there.
What are you watching?
Look, I... I'm sorry.
Abu, I'm sorry. I do not have...
Wait. Come on.
What am I doing?
Nero is right.
I have to tell Jasmine the truth.
Wings. You Ali.
Are you coming here?
Well, that's it.
Jasmine?
Where are you?
In Menager. Hurry up.
I am coming.
Got a problem, Pinky?
Jerk.
Boy, Jafar is glad to see you.
- Great job, Lago.
- Go on.
Not really. In scale
from one to ten, you are eleven.
Oh Jafar, you are so kind.
I'm embarrassed.
I'm blushing.
People of Agrabah,
my daughter finally
chose a suitor.
Jasmine.
Ali, where have you been?
Jasmine, there is something
I have to tell you.
The whole kingdom has turned
For the Proclamation of the Father.
No, but Jasmine, listen to me.
- You do not understand...
- Congratulations.
...He's a Dog!
Oh no.
Look at them,
clapping this little pipe.
Let them clap.
Let them clap.
You know, Al, I'm really...
I don't think you're him.
Tonight Ali's role
present tall and dark
and an ominous ugly man.
- I am your master now.
- That's what I was afraid of.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
I want to rule on high as a sultan.
- Wow!
- Bless my soul.
What is this?
What is happening?
Oh my god, what's going on?
Father.
Jafar, you vile traitor.
For you, it's Sultan Vile Betrayer.
Indeed?
We'll see only then.
A lamp.
Guardians of the Finders, Abooboo.
Genius, no!
Sorry, son.
I now have a new master.
Jafar, I'm telling you to stop.
Ah, but now there is a new order.
My order.
Finally you bow to me.
We will never bow down to you.
Why am I not surprised?
If you do not bow to the Sultan,
then you bow
in front of the wizard!
Genius, my second wish...
I want to be the most powerful wizard
in the world!
Genius, stop!
Ladies and gentlemen,
a warm welcome to Agrabah
old Jafarille!
Where were we now?
Yes. Gross humiliation.
Down there, son.
Oh princess.
There is someone I will die with
to introduce you.
Jafar. Do not touch her.
#PrinceAli
yes it's him#
#But not as you know#
#Read my lips
And face reality#
#Yes, meet a blast from your past#
#whose lies were too good to last#
#Say Hello
To my dear Prince Ali#
Or should we say Aladdin?
Ali?
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I am fair...
#So Ali turns out to be
Simply Aladdin#
#Just a scam, shall I continue#
#Believe me#
#her personality flaw#
#give me a valid reason#
#Send him packing
With a one-way ticket#
#So its future prospects
Make a terminal dive#
#His frozen assets, selected location
It's the end of the world, oops!#
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye, see you soon.
#Former Prince Ali#
Abu.
Abu!
Oh, this is all my fault.
I should have released the spirit
when I had the chance. Abu.
- Do you agree?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry, Abu.
I mixed it up.
One way or another... I have to go back
and make things right.
Carpet.
Abu, start digging.
That's it.
Yeah! Clear!
Now back to Agrabah.
Let's go.
Puppet leader wants cookies?
Here are your cookies.
Shoved in the back of the throat.
Here. Get a lot.
Stop that.
Jafar, leave him alone.
It hurts me to see you
minus that, Jasmine.
Nopa's beautiful flowering serves
like you
should be most in the arm
powerful man in the world.
What do you say, darling?
Why, when you're the queen...
Never.
I'm going to teach you respect.
Hey Genie.
I have decided to
make my last wish.
I wish Princess Jasmine
to fall in despair
in love with me
Ah, master, there are some additions,
compensation...
don't answer me
you big blue thug.
What are you going to do
I command you to do it, slave.
Jafar.
I never realized how much...
You are unbelievable beautiful.
Mmmm. It `s better.
Now the cat...
tell me more about myself.
You are tall...
dark...
well dressed...
Al. Al, the boyfriend.
Shh
Al, I can't help you.
I now work for Señor Psychopath.
What are you going to do?
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'm going to improvise.
...nice little openings
between the teeth.
Jack.
And your beard...
is so... twisted.
- You stole my heart.
-He knows...!
- What about a street rat?
What street rat?
Joo !
It was...
You!
How many times
should I kill you, my son?
Get a lamp.
No!
Ah, ah, ah, prinsessa.
Your time is up.
Jasmine.
Nice picture Jaf...
Don't play with me.
Abu!
Things fall apart
hurry now, my boy.
Understand?
I'm just warming up.
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?
A snake, right?
Maybe you'd like to see
how much I can look like a snake.
#Rick'em, rack'em, rock'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake#
Stay away from it.
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... that's fine!
Aladdin.
Jasmine, wait.
You little idiot.
You thought you could win
the most powerful being on earth.
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze it like... Awk!
Without genius, my son,
you are nothing
Nero. Nero.
Geniuses have more power
which you will never have.
What?
He gave you your strength.
He can take it off.
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?
Admit it, Jafar.
You're still only in second place.
You are right.
His strength surpasses mine.
But not for long.
The boy is crazy.
He's a little drunk.
One shot too many with a snake.
Slave, I make my third wish.
I want to be
almighty genius!
Fine, your wish is my command.
Well done, Al.
Joo.
Joo!
Power.
Absolute power!
- What have you done?
- Trust me.
The universe belongs to me
control!
Not so fast, Jafar.
Don't you forget something?
- Ai?
- You wanted to be a genius...
you figured it out.
What?
And everything that goes with it.
- No! No!
- I'm getting out of here.
Phenomenal Cosmic Powers...
You are a genius. I dont want...
Very small living space.
Al, you little genius, you.
Ahh!
Shut your mouth
out of my face.
- Shut up, fool.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
I can.
, years in the cave of wonders
that should calm him down.
Shut up!
Jasmine...
I'm sorry for lying to you
about being a prince.
I know why you did it.
I fancy...
Is this okay?
Oh this stupid law.
It's not fair.
I love you.
Al, it's okay.
You have one more wish left.
Sano vain sana
and you are a prince again.
But, genius,
what about your freedom
Hey, it's just
an eternity of slavery.
It's love.
Al, you won't find another girl
than him in a million years.
Believe me, I know.
I looked.
Jasmine, I love you,
but i have to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.
I understand.
Genius, I desire your freedom.
Real
the prince's pedigree is forthcoming.
- What?
- Genius, you're free.
I am free. I am free.
Quickly. Quickly.
Hope for something extraordinary.
Say, "I want the Nile." Try this.
- I hope for Niili.
- Never!
Oh, does it feel good! I see!
I am free! I'm finally free!
I'm about to hit the road.
I'm going to see the world.
I am...
Genius, I am...
I will miss you.
Me too, Al.
Forget it
what someone says
you will always be a prince to me.
Properly.
You have certainly proven your worth
what comes to me.
Tämä on laki
Tämä on ongelma.
- Isä?
- No, olenko sulttaani vai olenko sulttaani?
Tästä päivästä alkaen,
prinsessa menee naimisiin
jonka hän pitää arvollisena.
Häntä. Valitsen...
Valitsen sinut, Aladdin.
Kutsu minua Al.
Oi te kaikki, tulkaa tänne.
Iso ryhmähali.
Ryhmähali.
Haittaako sinua, jos suutelen apinaa?
Voi karvapallo.
No, en voi tehdä enempää vahinkoa
tämän Popsicle-telineen ympärillä.
Lähden!
Hyvästi, te kaksi hullua rakaslintua!
Hei, Rugman, ciao.
Minä olen tarina.
Ei, olen mytologia.
En välitä mikä olen. Olen vapaa!
#Täysin uusi maailma#
#Täysin uusi elämä#
#Sinulle ja minulle#
#Täysin uusi maailma #?
Sai sinut katsomaan.

ALADDIN

Voi, olen kotoisin maasta
Kaukaisesta paikasta

Missä karavaanan kamelit vaeltavat

Missä se on tasaista ja valtavaa
Ja lämpö on kovaa

Se on barbaarista, mutta hei, se on kotini

Kun tuuli tulee idästä
Ja aurinko tulee lännestä

Ja hiekka lasissa on oikeaa

Tule alas, pysähdy
Hyppää matolle ja lentää

Kohti toista arabiyötä

Arabian yöt

Kuten arabien aikana

Suurimman osan ajasta
Ovat kuumempia kuin kuumia



Monin tavoin

Arabian yöt

"Neath arabien kuut

Hullu pois vankilastaan
Voi pudota ja pudota kovaa

Tuolla dyynillä

Ah, sa/aam ja hyvää iltaa
sinulle, arvokas ystävä.

Ole hyvä ja tule lähemmäs.

Liian lähellä. Hieman liian lähellä.

siellä.

Tervetuloa Agrabahiin,

mysteerin, lumouksen kaupunki,

ja parhaat tavarat
on this side Jordan,

on sale today. Get lost.

Look at this. Yeah.



No offense. No...

It fell apart.

Oops! Look at this.

I have never seen
one of them was previously intact.

This is famous
Tupperware from the Dead Sea.

Listen. Ah, still good.

Wait. Do not go.

I see you're just interested
in exceptionally rare cases.

I think you would then
will be most rewarded for considering this.

Don't be fooled
because of the banal appearance.

Like so many things,
it's not what's outside

but what is important inside.

This is no ordinary lamp.

Once it changed course
of a young man's life.

A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than it seemed.

A diamond in the rough.

It begins in the dark of night,

where the dark man waits

with a dark lens.

(HORSE NICKERS)

You are late.

A thousand pardons, O patient one.

Do you have it then?

I had to cut a couple of throats, but I made it.

Ah-ah-ahhh.

Treasure.

AH!

Trust me my spicy friend.

- You get what you expect.
- What's wrong. Ouch!

Quickly! Follow the path.

Faster.

(HORSE'S NEIGHBORS)

(WIND HOWLS)

JAFAR: Finally,
after all my years of research,

Cave of Wonders.

Alright. Cave of Wonders.

By Allah.

Remember now. Bring me the lamp.

The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

(NAURU)

Oh, the lamp. Oh, the lamp.

Damn, where did you get this bastard?

Shh

(echoes thunder)

- Who is disturbing my sleep?
(THIEF gasps)

It's me, Gazeem, a humble thief.

Know this.

Only one can come here,

whose value is far.

A diamond in the rough.

What are you waiting for? Jack.

(Beast sighs)

-(ROAR)
(yell)

No!

(what's up)

I can not believe it. I just don't believe it.

We never will
take that stupid lamp.

Forget it. Look at this.
I'm so angry that I tolerate it.

Patience, Iago. Patience.

Gazeem apparently was
less than worthy.

Oh, there's a big surprise.

I think I'm having a heart attack
and die of this surprise.

What are we going to do?
We have a big problem here, a big...

Joo.

Only one can enter.

I need to find this, this...

A diamond in the rough.

MAN: Stop! Thief!

I will take the trophy from your hand,
street rat

All this for bread?

Wow!

(YELL)

- VALTIJA: There he is!
- You won't get through this so easily!

Did you think it was easy?

(NAURA)

You two over there
and you, follow me.

- We'll find him.
- Hey ladies.

We run into problems a little early
today, right, Aladdin?

- I got you.
- I have problems.

And this time...

( MONKEY SQUENQNG

Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

(SINGING) I gotta jump
Ahead of the bread line

One step ahead of the sword

I only steal what I can't afford

That's all

A jump ahead of law enforcement

That's it, and it's no joke

- Precipitation
- MOLEMAT: Katurotta

WARNING: Bad
MAN.” Take it

A little snack, guys

tear it apart
Take it back guys

I can take a hint
I have to face the facts

- You are my only friend, Abu
- WOMEN: Who?

Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom

He has become a bachelor who increases crime

I would blame the parents
Except he doesn't have them

I must eat to live
I have to steal to eat

I will tell you everything
When I had time

Jump ahead of slow kicks
One step ahead of my loss

Next time I'll use a pen name

Here it is

A jump ahead of the hitters
A step ahead of the pack

I think I'll go for a walk
Around the block

- MAN: Stop, thief
-Vanda/

- Abu
Scandal

Let's not be too hasty

I still think it's pretty tasty.

I must eat to live
I have to steal to eat

Otherwise we would get along fine

RULER: Wrong

HEAD GUARD: Get him!

He has a sword!

You are idiots. We all have swords.

(MENU)

- Leap forward from a hoof strike
- Vandal!

- Jump in front of the bump
- Damn you rat!

- Something before the disaster
Charlatan!

They are fast, but I am much faster

Come on, I better put my hand in

I wish you a safe landing
AH what I have to do is jump

(YELL)

GUARDS: Cheers! Hey!

ABU: Nam, nam!

Oh no.

(SIGH)

Here. Jack. Take it.

(NAURA)

(MOANS)

Oh no. Huh?

On the way to the palace, I guess.

Another suitor for the princess.

(LAUGHTER)
(WOMAN FIBER)

-(HEIGNANT)
- Get out of my way, brats.

Hey!

If I were as rich as you
I could indulge in certain habits.

I see. I'm going to teach you manners.

(MEN SHOUT)

(GRIMACING)

Look at that, Abu.

You don't see that every day
a horse with two rear ends.

CROWD: Whoa!

You are a worthless street rat.

You were born a street rat,
you die like a street rat

and only your fleas cry for you.

I'm not worth anything.

And I don't have fleas.

(SINGING) Riffraff, street rat

I'm not buying this

If only they would take a closer look

Would they see the poor boy?

No, sir

They would find

There is so much more

To me

(Sighs) One day, Abu,
things change.

We become rich, we live in a palace,

and I've never had any problems.

(COCKS GROW)

I have never been so offended.

Oh Prince Ahmed.
You're not leaving that early, are you?

Good luck marrying him.

Oh yes! Jasmine.

Jasmine!

Jasmine!

- Jasmine!
-(GRAIN)

That's fucked up, Rajah.

So that's why
Prince Ahmed rushed out.

Oh dad.

Rajah was just playing with him.
Isn't that right, Rajah?

you're just kidding
also dressed in

Self-centered Prince Ahmed,
Is not it ?

(ALL LAUGHTER)

(CLEARS THROAT)

Honey, you need to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes calling.

The law says
you must be married to a prince

before your next birthday.

The law is wrong.

You only have three days left.

Dad, I hate being forced to do this.

If I get married, I want it to be for love.

jasmine,

it's not just this law.

I'm not going to be here forever,
well i...

I just want to be sure
you will be taken care of.

Anticipated.

Try to understand.

I've never done anything myself.
I never had real friends.

(GRUNTS)

Except you, Rajah.

I didn't even go outside
the palace walls.

But Jasmine, you are a princess.

So maybe I don't want to
to be more of a princess.

Oooh! I...

Allah forbids you to do so
have daughters.

Hmm?

I don't know where he got it from.

His mother was not so picky.

I see! Ah, Jafar.

My most trusted advisor.

My life is only to serve you, my lord.

- I'm at the end of my nerves.
- Oh okay ! End of the rope!

(LAUGHS) go on!

- Take a cookie, pretty Polly.
(JAFAR LAUGH)

Your Majesty absolutely
reasonable with stupid animals.

(GRUNTS)

NOW,
maybe i can guess the solution

to this difficult problem.

If anyone can help, it's you.

But this would require some use
of the mystical blue diamond.

Oh, my ring?

But it's been in the family for years.

We have to find out
princess suitor.

Do not worry.

Everything will be fine.

Everything will be fine.

Diamond.

Here, Jafar.

Everything you need is in order.

You are very kind, my lord.

Now run and play
with your little toys, huh?

Yeah. It's going to be pretty good.

(Spit, cough)

I can not take it anymore !

If I have to choke one more time
those moldy, disgusting cookies...

Barn! Hit!

Calm down, Iago.

Then I grabbed her head.
V Hack!

Soon I will be a Sultan,
not this confused idiot.

And then I fill with cookies
in his throat. Ha, ha!

(MOANS)

Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

But I can't stay here
and let my life live for me.

I will miss you.

(MOANS)

Hey Hey.

(CALL FROM SELLER)

Okay, Abu. Go.

Try it. Your taste buds
dances and sings.

(whine)

- Get your paw off of it.
-(RAITA)

Why you...

Out of here,
you damned dirty monkey!

Hey Hey.

- Well done, Abu.
-(KUJERRUS)

Breakfast will be served.

Beautiful woman, buy a pot.
There is no finer pot made of brass or silver.

Sugar dates. Sweet dates and figs.

Sweet dates and pistachios.

Would a woman like a necklace?

A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.

Fresh fish!

We catch them, you buy them!

Oh no. I do not believe.

-About
(SWALKING)

- Sorry.
(GULPS)

(röyhtäily)

I'm really, really sorry.

Wow.

Oh no.

Good morning? Good morning?

Oh, you must be hungry.

Here is.

You better be able to pay for it.

- Pay?
- No one steals my basket.

Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I do not have money.

- The powers!
- Please...

If you let me go to the palace,
I can get from Sultan.

You know
what is the punishment in case of theft?

No! No thanks!

Thank you sir.
I'm so glad you found it.

I'm looking for you everywhere.

- What are you doing?
- Play a game.

Do you know this girl?

Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister.

He's a little crazy.

He said he knew the Sultan.

He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?

(SIHAA)

Tragic, right?

But no harm is done.

Come now, sister.
It's time to go to the doctor.

Hello, Doctor. How's it going?

No no no. Not this one.
Come, Sultan.

(GIBERATION)

(EXCITING)

Huh? What?

Come back here, you little thieves!

(EXPLOSION)

can't we just wait for a real storm?

Hold your breath, Iago. Faster.

Yes, oh mighty evil.

(EXCITING)

Gone, the sands of time.

Reveal it to me
who can enter the cave.

Yeah! Yeah!

Here it is.

My diamond in the rough.

It's him? It's a clown
Did we wait?

Let the guards get on with it
an invitation to the palace, okay?

Swell.

(COUGH)

(GOOD LAUGHTER)

Almost there.

I want to thank you
for arresting this man.

Forget it.

So this is your first time
in the market, huh?

Is it that obvious?

Well, you stand out.

I mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

Hmmm, I'm a fast learner.

Wow.

(LAUGHS) Hi.

Come on. Like this.

Wow. Watch your head out there.

Be careful.

Do you live here?

Yeah. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

This looks amazing.

Well, it's not much,
but it has a great view.

Wow. The palace looks
Pretty surprising, huh?

Oh, that's wonderful.

I wondered what it would be like
it's like i lived there

and they have servants and servants.

Oh, of course. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

It's better than here.

You are always looking for food
and dodge the guards.

You are not free
make your own choices.

- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

- Ansa.
- Ansa.

(CLEARS THROAT)
So where are you from?

What does it matter?

I ran away and I'm not coming back.

- Really? How so?
- Why you...

My father is forcing me to marry.

It's... It's terrible.

- ALADDINI Abou!
(OUTLOOK OF HATE)

What?

Abu says it is not fair.

What?

- Is that right?
- Of course.

Ja Abu
do you have anything else to say?

Well, he wishes he had
something he could do to help.

Oh no.

Hmm.

Tell him it's very nice.

There you are.

- They're after me!
- Are they after you?

My father must have sent them...

- Do you trust me?
- What?

- Do you trust me?
- Joo...

So jump!

We keep crossing paths,
Aren't you, street rat?

Run! Go! Out of here!

Take this thing away from me!

- This is a dungeon for you, son.
- Let me go.

Let him go.

- Look here, men. Street mouse.
(GUARDS Laugh)

Let him go at the princess's command.

Princess Jasmine.

- Princess?
-ABU: Princess?

It's not your problem.
Do as I say. Release him.

i will princess
except my orders come from Jafar.

- You need to discuss it with him.
- Believe me, I will.

Am I far away?

Oh princess.

Ouch! Jafar, I'm stuck.

How can I be of help to you?

The guards just took the boy
of your order.

Your father blamed me
in maintaining peace in Agrabah.

- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

I can't breathe, Jafar.

Why by kidnapping the princess,
Of course.

If you could only... Aah! It hurts!

He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

Ohhh.

Oh, how shocking.
If I would have known...

What do you mean?

Alas, the verdict of the boy
has already been completed.

What sentence?

- Death.
-(TEMPTATION)

- By beating.
- No.

I'm very sorry, princess.

How are you?

(TEARS)

(what's up)

(EXCITING)

So how did it go?

I think he took it pretty well.

(JASMINE cries)

It's all my fault, Rajah.

- I didn't even know his name.
(RAJAH WHISPER)

I must have looked so stupid to him.

ABUI Y00-h00! Aladdin! Good morning!

Abu. Here.

(whine)

Come on, help me out of this.

(CAUSE)

Hey, he was in trouble.
Ah, he was worth it.

Yeah yeah yeah

Don't worry, Abu.
I will never see him again.

I'm a street rat, remember?
And there is a law.

She must marry the prince.

- He deserves a prince.
- Da-da!

I'm stupid.

MAN: You're just an idiot
if you give up son

Who are you?

A humble prisoner like you.

I'm listening.

There is a cave, my son,
cave of wonders,

full of treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

Ooh!

The treasure is enough to impress
even your princess, I guess.

Jaiar, can you hurry up?
I'm the gym, I'm here.

-(Invitation)
- But the law says that only the prince can...

You've heard of the golden rule,
Is not it ?

(squealing laughter)

Why are you sharing all this
lovely treasure with me?

I need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to continue it.

One problem.

It is there. We are here.

Um. Things are not always
what they look like.

So, do we have a deal?

Oh, I don't know.

(THUNDER CRASH)

Who disturbs sleep?

It's me, Aladdin.

Proceed.

Do not touch anything other than the lamp.

And then you get your reward.

Come on, Abu.

(whine)

- Can you look at it!
-(MOANS)

Abu!

(GROAN)

Don't touch anything.

We need to find this lamp.

(GRUNTS)

Eh?

- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you stop him?

(YELL)

Abu what are you crazy?

A magic carpet.

Come on. Go out.
We're not going to hurt you.

(YELL)

Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not going to bite.

THANK YOU.

(whine)

Wait a moment. Do not go.

Maybe you can help us.

Hey! Wow!

- I think he knows where it is.
-(GET EXCITED)

(ECHOE5)

(whispers) Wait here.

(MENU)

I see!

That's it?

This is what we came for
all the way here...

Abu! They!

- CAVE: Infidels!
- Oh no.

CAVE: You've touched
forbidden treasure!

Now you'll never do it again
see the day!

Wow!

Car! Car! Car!

I got you!

Mat, let's move.

Abu!

Abu, now is not the time to panic.

Start panicking.

MOLEMAT: Wow!

(ABU panting)

(thunder cracks)

(ROAR)

- Help me.
- Throw me a lamp.

I can not take it. Give me your hand.

Give me the lamp first.

(MANIAC LAUGHTER)

Joo!

finally!

-(MEAN LAUGH)
(ALADDIN'S BATTLE)

What are you doing?

Give you your reward.

Your eternal reward.

(YELL)

(YELL)

(ROAR)

(CHUCKUNG)

It's mine.

It's all mine.

I... Where is he?

No.

No!

Jasmine?

SULTANI: Oh my dear.

What's wrong?

(RECORDING)

Jafar has

did something terrible.

There, there, my love.

We'll make things right.

Now tell me everything.

I see.

Aladdin. Wake up.

Aladdin.

On! My head.

They were trapped.

This two-faced jackal boy!

(grunt)

whoever he is
he has been away for a long time with that lamp.

Ah!

(NAURA)
Well, you hairy little thief.

It looks like a beating,
worthless scrap metal.

Hi, I think so
something written here

but it's hard to understand.

Aaaaahhhhh!

C) y!

10,000 years will give you
such a stiff neck.

Wait a minute.

Friends! Wow!

Does it feel good to be outside?

Hey. Where do you come from?
What is your name?

Er... Er, Aladdin.

Aladdin. Hello Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

Can we call you Ali?
Or maybe just dinner?

And Laddie? It looks like,
"Here, son. Come on, son."

I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do?
(NAURA)

Sorry, Cheetah.
I hope I didn't burn the fur.

Oh, Rugman. I did not see you
in a few millennia.

Give me the pompom. Yeah. Uh huh.

Say you are much smaller
as my last master.

Either that or I gained weight.

Look at me sideways.
Do I look different to you?

Odota hetki. Olenko herrasi?

Oikein. Hän voi olla koulutettu.
Mitä toivoisit minulle?

Aina vaikuttava,

pitkä sisältö,

usein jäljitelty,

mutta ei koskaan kopioitu...

(kaiku) Monistettu, monistettu...

Lampun nero!

Täällä, suoraan lampusta,

tässä
vilpittömimpien toiveidesi täyttämiseksi.

KIITOS.

- Vau. Toiveiden täyttymys?
- Tarkemmin sanottuna kolme toivetta.

Ja ixnay toiveeseen
lisää toiveita varten.

Se siitä. Kolme. Lino, takaisin, hyvin.

Nyt tiedän, että näen unta.

Mestari, en usko, että sinä todella ymmärrät
mitä sinulla on täällä.

Joten miksi ei vain märehtiä
samalla kun valaistan mahdollisuuksia.

(LAULAA)
No, Ali Baba sai 40 varasta

Scheherazadella oli tuhat tarinaa

Mutta herra, olet onnekas
Koska käärit hihat

Sinulla on taikuutta, joka ei koskaan petä

Sinulla on valtaa
Nyt nurkassasi

Sinulla on booli, mauste
Yahoo ja miten

Katso, kaikki mitä sinun tarvitsee tehdä
Hieron tätä lamppua ja sanon

"Herra Aladdin, sir
Mikä on ilosi? »

Anna minun ottaa tilauksesi
Kirjoita se ylös

Sinulla ei ole koskaan ollut sellaista ystävää kuin minä

Elämä on ravintolasi
Ja minä olen hovimestarisi

Tule, kuiskaa mitä haluat

Sinulla ei ole koskaan ollut sellaista ystävää kuin minä

kyllä ​​herra
Olemme ylpeitä palvelusta

Olet pomo, kuningas, shaahi

Sano mitä haluat
Se on sinun, oikea ruokalaji

Entä lisää baklavaa?

Ota vähän A-saraketta
Kokeile koko saraketta B

Haluan auttaa sinua, mies

Sinulla ei ole koskaan ollut sellaista ystävää kuin minä

Voi voi

Ei ei

Ohhoh

(DIFFUUSIO)

Voivatko ystäväsi tehdä tämän?

Voivatko ystäväsi tehdä tämän?

Voivatko ystäväsi vetää tämän

Otivatko he pienen hattunsa?

Voivatko ystäväsi mennä pöhille

Hei, katso tästä
Ha-ha!

Voivatko ystäväsi mennä?
“Abrakadabra, anna sen repiä”

Joten älä vain istu siellä
Pehmeä leuka, vaeltavat silmät

Olen täällä vastaamassa
AH keskiyön rukouksesi

Todistit minut hyvässä uskossa

Sinulla on nero
Yritysjohtajallesi

Minulla on vahva halu auttaa sinua

Joten mikä on toiveesi?
Haluan todella tietää

Sinulla on luettelo
Se on epäilemättä kolme mailia pitkä

AH what you need to do is rub like that

Herra Aladdin, sir
I have a wish or two or three

I'm at work, big mogul

You've never had a friend
I've never had a friend

You've never had a friend
I've never had a friend

You've never had a friend

Like me

Ah-ha-ha!

- Wah-ha-ha!
(Brilliant LAUGHTER)

You've never had a friend like me

-(WHIRLS)
(WEAK Applause)

(Speaking) Huh?

-(MOANS)
- What will it be, Master?

You give me
three wishes what i want right?

Oh, almost.

There are some reservations,
some allowances.

Like?

So don't ask.

Rule number two.

I can't make anyone
fall in love with someone else.

You little pony over there.

Rule number three. I can't bring
people come back from the dead.

It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing that.

Otherwise, there you have it.

- Hmm.
- I see!

Reservations? Do you mean boundaries?

based on wishes? An almighty genius.

I can't even bring people
back from the dead.

I don't know, Abu. It probably is
I can't even get us out of this cave.

Looks like we have to
find a way out of here.

Sorry?

Are you looking at me?
Are you rubbing my lamp?

Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

And suddenly
are you cheating on me?

I don't think so, not at the moment.

-(ABU SHREAMS)
- In an emergency,

the exits are here, here,
here, here, wherever.

Hold hands and arms
inside the carpet.

Were you...

Out of here!

SULTAN: Jafar, this is a scandal.

If it weren't for all your years
good and loyal service...

From now on, we need to discuss
sentencing prisoners by rne,

before their heads were beheaded.

I assure you, Your Highness,
this will not happen again.

Jasmine...

Jafar. Let's put everything
complicated matters behind us.

Please.

At least something good will come
that I was forced to marry.

When I'm Queen
I have the power to get rid of you.

(laughs nervously)

Here right now. It's good.
So everything was agreed.

Now, Jasmine, I'll be back
about this proposal story...Jasmine?

Jasmine!

(VIRUS)

I wish I had this lamp.

(GROWL)
Let's say we have to keep kissing

- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.

Then he gets us a banana.

Or were beaten.

MOLEMAT: Wow!

I see. Wait a moment. Jafar.

What?

And then you become the Sultan.

I see.

Marry a snot.

I will be the Sultan.

- The idea is meritorious.
- Yes, it deserves it. Yeah.

And then we let the stepfather down
and the little woman on the edge of the cliff.

Joo !

Christmas plate!

(LAUGHTER)

I like the way
your dirty little mind works.

(MOOLEM LAUGH AWAY)

Don't stand by the mat
has completely stopped.

THANK YOU. Goodbye now.
Bye. THANK YOU.

Well, how about this,
M. Do you suspect Mustafa?

Oh, you showed me that well.
Now for my three wishes.

Are my ears failing me?

Three? You're one point behind, son.

Oh no. I never really hoped
to get out of the cave.

You did it alone.

Well, I feel stupid.

All right you bad boy
but no more gifts.

Fair trade. Three wishes, then.

I want them to be good.

What would you like to?

I?

No one has ever asked me that before.

Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

- What?
- No, I can't. I...

Come on. Tell me.

Freedom.

Are you a prisoner?

All of this is an essential part
the whole genius concert.

Phenomenal Cosmic Powers...

Very small living space.

Genius, this is terrible.

But oh, to be free...

No need to go there
"Huh huh. What do you need?

"Huh huh. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

To be my own master.

Such a thing would be bigger
that all magic

and all the treasures around the world.

But what am I talking about?

Let's be real here.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

Why not?

The only way to get out
if my master wants me to go.

So you can guess how often
it happened.

I will do it. I will set you free.

- Uh-huh, that's true.
- Not really, I promise.

After making my first two wishes,

I will use my third wish to free you.

Well, I hope so. Clear.

Let's make magic.

So what is it?
What do you want most?

Well, there's this girl.

Fake.

I can't make anyone
falling in love, remember?

But, genius,
he's smart and funny and...

- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

He has these eyes that...
And that hair. Wow.

And his smile... (SIGHS)

Am I.

It's love.

But she is a princess.

Hey, can you make me a prince?

Let's see here.

Is chicken king? No.

Alaskan king crab.
Ouch. I hate it when they do that.

Caesar salad. Ah! And you, Brute? No.

Haha. "Make a prince."

Is this an official wish?
Say the magic words.

Genius, I wish you
make me a prince

Clear!

Eh heh! Frame! Frame!

First, this Fez and vest combination
it is too third century.

These corrections.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

No, let's work with me here.

Oops. I like this. Very macho.

Now he needs something else.
What does that tell me?

It's about the means of transportation.

Sorry, little monkey.
Aqul'. Like this.

- Oh no.
- GENIUS: This is where he comes from.

What better way to make your own
entering the streets of Agrabah

like riding a horse
your own brand new camel?

Attention. They spit.

Mmmm. Not enough.

It's still not enough.
Wait and see. What do you need?

Joo!

Esalalumbo Shimin Dumbo.

- Wow!
-(trumpetit)

Talk about your trunk.
Check this function.

(trumpetit)

(scary monkey sounds)

Abu, you look good.

GENIUS: He has an outfit.
He has an elephant.

But we're not done yet.

Hold on to your turban, son.
We will make you a star.

(DOOR OPENS)

Sir i found the solution
your daughter's problem.

Really?

Here.

“If the princess has not chosen
husband at an agreed time,

"Then the Sultan will choose for him."

But Jasmine hated all these suitors.

How could I choose someone
he hates?

Don't worry, sir. There's more.

“Just in case
We can't find a suitable prince..."

Jerk.

"Then the princess must be married..."

Hmm. Interesting.

What? WHO?

Royal Visor.

Well that would be me.

I am pretty sure...

Desperate times call
of desperate measures, my lord.

Yeah. Desperate measures.

I order the princess...

But you are so old.

The princess will marry me.

The princess is getting married...

(TRUMPET FRANK)
- What? What is this?

This music.

(CHUCKUNG)

Jafar, you need to come see this.

(SING) Road to Prince Ali

Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"

Hey, lead the way in the old bazaar

Hey you, let us pass
It's the new shining star

Come on, be the first in your neighborhood
to meet his gaze

Make way, here it is
Ring bells, beat drums

You will love this guy

Prince Ali, wonderful he is
Ali Dogs

Genuine, show respect
On your knees

Now do your best to stay calm

Improve your Sunday salami

So come and meet
His wonderful troupe

Prince Ali, he is powerful
Ali Dogs

Strong than 10 normal men, definitely

He galloped against the hordes

A hundred evils with swords

Who sent these idiots to their masters?
Why, Prince Ali

He has 75 golden camels

Aren't they lovely, June?

Purple peacocks, he has 53

Great, Harry. I love feathers.

Does it have a zoo
I will tell you

It is a world class zoo

Prince Ali, he is handsome
Ali Dogs

This physics, how can I speak
Weak knee

Well come out to this place

Adjust your sails and get ready

Gawk and Grove! and look
At Prince Ali's

- He has 95 white Persian monkeys
- He has monkeys

- Let's look at the monkeys
- And there is no charge for seeing them

He is generous
So generous

He has slaves
He has servants and minions

They are just sick of being loyal to everyone

Prince Ali

Prince Ali, he is in love
Ali Dogs

I heard your princess
It was a pleasant sight

And so, folks,

He got dressed and left

60 elephants and llamas galore

With bears and lions
Marssibändi ja paljon muuta

Hänen 40 fakiirinsa kanssa
Sen kokit, sen leipurit

Hänen linnunsa visertävät sivussa

Tee tilaa

Prinssi Alille

Loistavaa. Aivan mahtavaa.

(PUHDISTAA KURKKU)

Teidän korkeutenne,

Olen matkustanut kauas ja laajalle
etsi tyttäresi kättä.

Prinssi Ali Ababwa.

Tietysti. Hauska tavata.

Tämä on kuninkaallinen visiirini Jafar.
Hän on myös iloinen.

Hurmioitunut.

- Pelkään, prinssi Abubu...
-Ababwa.

Unohda koko juttu.

Et voi vain rullata tänne
kutsumattomia ja odottaa...

Allahin toimesta,
Tämä on todella merkittävä laite.

Oho.

En usko, että voisin...

Totta kai, Teidän Majesteettinne.
Saanen.

Herra, minun on neuvottava sinua olemaan tekemättä tätä.

Voi nappia kiinni, Jafar.
Opi pitämään vähän hauskaa.

AIE Aie Aie.

Ahh! Vau!

Huomio olen tulossa.

Voi, paljon pidemmälle kuin
olet matkustanut, olen varma.

- Kokeile minua.
- SULTAN: Ole varovainen, Polly.

Hei, tarkista tämä.

Katso häntä tuon typerän maton kanssa.

Ah!

Huh huh!

Pois tieltä. Olen tulossa maahan.

Jafar, katso tätä.

- Näyttävä, teidän korkeutenne.
- Se oli ihanaa.

Kyllä, minulla näyttää olevan lahja siihen.

Tämä on erittäin vaikuttava nuoriso.

Ja prinssi siinä.

- En luota häneen, sir.
- Se on absurdia.

Olen yhdestä asiasta ylpeä, Jafar,
Olen erinomainen luonnetuomari.

Oi, erinomainen tuomari. Tottakai. Ei!

SULTAN: Jasmine pitää tästä.

Ja olen melko varma
Haluaisin prinsessa Jasminen.

Teidän korkeutenne, ei.
Minun on puhuttava Jasminen puolesta.

Mikä saa hänet ajattelemaan
Onko hän prinsessan arvoinen?

Anna hänen tavata minut.
Voitan tyttäresi.

Kuinka kehtaat.

Te kaikki.
Jäänkö päättämään tulevaisuudestani?

En ole voitettava palkinto.

Ohhoh.

Älä huoli, prinssi Ali.
Anna Jasminelle aikaa rauhoittua.

Mielestäni on aika sanoa hyvästit
prinssi Abubulle.

ALADDIN: (HUOKAA)
Mitä teen?

Minun olisi pitänyt tietää, etten pääse tästä eroon
tämä tyhmä prinssi toivoo.

(MURISTA)

Joten liikkukaa.

Hei-

Se on hyvä päätös.

En voi uskoa sitä. Häviän all-inille.

Nero, tarvitsen apua.

Selvä, Sparky, tässä on sopimus.

Jos haluat kostella pientä rouvaa,
you have to be an honest shooter.

- Did you get it?
- What?

(READING)

Not at all.

If Jasmine found out I really am
dirty street rat,

he would laugh at me.

A woman appreciates a man
who makes him laugh.

Al, kidding aside,
you should really be yourself.

Hey, that's the last thing I want to be.

Okay, I'll go see him.

I just...
I have to be gentle, cool and confident.

How do I look?

Like a prince.

(SIGH)

- ALADDIN: Princess Jasmine?
-(GROWL)

- Who's here?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

Hmm. Oh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

I do not want to see you.

No, no, please, princess.
Give me a chance.

- JASMINE: Leave me alone.
- Down, cat.

How is our little friend?

- Good cat, take it away.
(RAJAH GROWS)

Alas, kitty.

Wait. Wait.

I know you?

No. No.

You remind me of something
I met at the market.

Market?

I have servants who go
to the market for me.

Well, I even have servants who visit
my servant's market,

so it couldn't be me you met.

No, I guess not.

He's smart, funny, hair, eyes.

Nothing. Select a feature.

Hmm. Princess Jasmine?
You are very...

Lovely, wonderful, brilliant,

-precise.
- Punctual.

- Punctual?
- Sorry.

- Um, beautiful.
- Get well soon.

Hmm.

I'm rich too, you know.

- Joo.
- The Sultan's daughter.

I know.

A wonderful reward for any prince who marries.

That is true. PROPERLY. A prince like me.

Warning! Warning!

PROPERLY. A prince like you.

And all the other sweatshirts,
a fluttering peacock I met.

Car! Car!

- What?
- Stop him. Stop him!

- Do you want me to poke him?
- Go out.

OK very good.
But remember the "bee" itself.

- Really.
- What?

Er... Er, you're right.

(Sighs) You're not fair
prize to be won.

You should be free
make your own choice.

I'll go now.

- No!
- What? What?

How...

How do you do this?

- It's a flying carpet.
- It is wonderful.

-(KISSES)
- You...

We could leave the palace,
see the world.

- Is it safe?
- Of course. Do you trust me?

- What?
- Do you trust me?

Joo.

(SINGING) I can show you the world

Brilliant, glittering, magnificent

Tell me, princess

Now that you did last time
Let your heart decide

I can open my eyes

Marvel at the miracle

Above, side and below

On a flying carpet

A whole new world

A great new perspective

No one tells us no
Or where to go

Or suppose we are only dreaming

A whole new world

A dazzling place
I never knew

But when I'm up there
It's crystal clear

That now I'm involved
A whole new world with you

ALADDIN: Now I am here
A whole new world with you

JASMINE: amazing performances

An unspeakable feeling

Hovering, spinning, spinning freely

Through the endless diamond sky

- A completely new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes

- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it will get better

I'm like a shooting star
I have come this far

I can't go back to where I was

- A completely new world
- Every turn is a surprise

- To pursue new horizons
- Every moment a red letter

BOTH: I'll chase them anywhere
There is time to waste

Let me share
This whole new world with you

- A completely new world
- A completely new world

- This is where we will be
- This is where we will be

- Thrilling chase
- Great place

For you and me

- Everything is so magical.
- Joo.

Too bad Abu had to miss this one.

No. He hates fireworks.

He doesn't like to fly either.

It's... Oh no.

You are a boy from the market.
I knew it.

- Why did you lie to me?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

- That I wouldn't understand?
- No.

I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

Who are you? Tell the truth.

Truth?

Truth. Um...

The truth is...

But I really am a prince.

Why didn't you tell me?

Well, you know

the royal goes to town
disguised,

feels a little weird
you do not believe?

Hmm.

Not so weird.

Good night, handsome prince.

Sleep well, princess.

(SIGH)

Joo!

(SIGH)

For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go well.

(HUTA)
-(IN TROUBLE)

Ashes. Ashes.

Keep it.

I'm afraid you're exhausted
welcome prince abubu.

(Grumpily) Why, you...

Make sure it's never found.

(NAURA)

Never fail. You take a bath
and there is a problem with the lamp.

Good morning? OH?

(gasps) OMG! Kid, stop it.

You can't fake this.
I can't help you unless you wish.

You must say, "Genius,
I want you to save my life.” Do you understand?

Come on, Aladdin!

I'll take it.
(TRACK ALARM)

Superior reach.

(GERMAN TAP)

(what's up)

Don't scare me like that.

Genius, I...

L.-

- Thanks, Genie.
- You Al.

I'm starting to like you, boy.

It's not that I want to choose
curtains or something.

(BURN)

SULTANI: Jasmine.

Oh dad, I just had
the most wonderful moment.

- I am so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

I chose a man for you.

- What?
- You will marry Jafar.

(EXCITING)

You are speechless, I see.
A great quality in a wife.

I will never marry you.

- Dad, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali is gone.

Better check
your crystal ball again, Jafar.

- Prince Ali!
-(TEMPTATION)

HOW... Umm. AWk!

Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to kill me.

What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

He is clearly lying.

Obviously lying.

Dad, what's wrong with you?

I know what's wrong.

Oh no!

Your Highness,
Jafar controls you with this.

(BLAMING) What? Jafar?

You traitor!

Guards! Guards!

Well, that's it. They were dead. Forget it.

Just dig a grave for both of us.
They were dead.

- SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.
-(IN TROUBLE)

It's not done yet, son.

(LAUGHTER)
-(COUGH)

-Jasmine, are you okay?
- Joo.

Jafar, my most trusted advisor,

been plotting against me all this time.

It's horrible, just horrible.

How could I ever...

Eh?

Could this be true?

My daughter finally
chose a suitor?

Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

Sinä loistava poika, voisin suudella sinua.

En tee sitä. Jätän sen minun...

Mutta sinä menet naimisiin samaan aikaan.

Kyllä kyllä. Ja sinä tulet olemaan onnellinen
ja vauras,

ja sitten sinä, poikani,
tulee sulttaani.

-Sulttaani?
-SULTAN: Kyllä.

Kaunis, rehellinen nuori mies
kuten sinä,

moitteeton henkilö
moraalinen luonne

Juuri tätä tämä valtakunta tarvitsee.

IAGO: Meidän täytyy päästä pois täältä.
Täytyy alkaa pakkaamaan. Vain välttämättömät.

Meidän täytyy matkustaa kevyesti.

Luulen, että teen sen kanssa oudot kasvot.

(NAURA MAANIAALISESTI)

Jafar! Jafar! Pidä otteen!

Hyvä tarttuvuus -

Prinssi Ali ei ole muuta kuin
tuo repaleinen poika, Aladdin.

- Hänellä on lamppu, Iago.
- No, tämä kurja...

Mutta sinä pääset siitä eroon.

Minä?

Sulttaani?

He haluavat minun olevan sulttaani?

Huzzah!

(LAULA) Tervehdys valloittajalle

(Isänmaallinen AIR PLAY)

Aladdin, sinä juuri voitit
prinsessan sydän.

Mitä aiot tehdä seuraavaksi?

(HUOKAA SYVÄSTI)

(kuiskaten) Psst. Sinun linjasi on,
"Aion päästää henkiin."

Milloin tahansa.

- Nero. En voi.
- Tietenkin voit.

Sanot vain: "Nero, toivon sinulle vapautta. »

Olen tosissani.

Kuule, olen pahoillani. Olen todella.
Mutta he haluavat tehdä minusta sulttaanin.

Ilman sinua olen vain Aladdin.

- Al, sinä voitat.
- Sinun takiasi.

Ainoa syy, miksi ajattelemme
Olen kaiken arvoinen, se johtuu sinusta.

Ja jos saavat tietää
Enkö todellakaan ole prinssi?

En voi toivoa sinulle vapautta.

HYVÄ. Ymmärrän.
Loppujen lopuksi valehtelit kaikille.

Hei, aloin tuntea oloni ulkopuolelle.

Annatteko nyt anteeksi, herra.

(smaruwe)

Genius, olen niin pahoillani.

(VADELMA)

HYVÄ. Joten pysy siellä.

Mitä te katsotte?

-(MOANS)
-(NUKISTUS)

ALADDIN: Kuuntele, minä... Olen pahoillani.

Abu, olen pahoillani. Minulla ei ole...

Odota. Älä viitsi.

(smaruwe)

Mitä olen tekemässä?

(Huokaa) Nero on oikeassa.

Minun täytyy kertoa Jasminelle totuus.

JASMINE: Ali. Voi Ali.
Tuletko tänne?

(HUOKA) No niin.

Jasmiini? Missä sinä olet?

(IMITES JASMINE)
Menagerissa. Kiirehdi.

- Olen tulossa.
-(HOUKUTUS)

(NAurua)

(hankalta naurua)
- Onko sinulla ongelma, Pinky?

Ääliö.

(iloinen nauru)

(JAFARIA)
"Erinomainen työ, Iago."

Jatka.

"Ei todellakaan. Mittakaavassa
yhdestä kymmeneen, olet 11."

Voi Jafar, olet niin kiltti.

Olen nolostunut. Minä punastun.

Agraban ihmiset,

tyttäreni vihdoin
valitsi kosijan.

(JOUKKO hurraa)
- ALADDIN: Jasmiini.

Ali, missä olet ollut?

Jasmine, siinä on jotain
Minun pitää kertoa sinulle.

Koko valtakunta on kääntynyt
Isän julistamista varten.

- Et ymmärrä...
- Onnea.

-SULTAANI: Ali Ababwa!
-(SUOSIONOSOITUKSET)

Voi ei.

(SUOSIONOSOITUKSET)

Katso heitä,
taputtaen tätä pientä piippua.

Anna heidän taputtaa.

Tiedätkö, Al, olen todella...

En usko, että olet hän.
Tänä iltana Alin rooli

esittää pitkä ja tumma
ja pahaenteinen ruma mies.

- Olen nyt herrasi.
- Sitä minä pelkäsin.

Genie, anna minulle ensimmäinen toiveeni.

Haluan hallita korkeudessa sultaanina.

- Vau!
- Siunaa sieluani.

Mikä tämä on? Mitä tapahtuu?

Voi luoja, mitä tapahtuu?

Isä.

(KUTSUMUS)

Jafar, sinä ilkeä petturi.

Sinulle se on Sultan Vile Betrayer.

Todellakin? Katsotaan vasta sitten.

-(GASPS) Lamppu.
(JAFAR LAUGH)

Löytäjien vartijat, Abubu.

(PILLIT)

(IHMISET KUITUVAT)

Nero, ei!

Anteeksi, poika. Minulla on nyt uusi mestari.

Jafar, käsken sinua lopettamaan.

Ah, mutta nyt on uusi tilaus.

Minun käskyni.

Lopulta kumarrat minua.

Emme koskaan kumarra sinua.

Miksi en ole yllättynyt?

Jos et kumarra sultanille,

niin kumarrut noidan edessä!

Nero, toinen toiveeni...

(JAFAR NAURAA MAANIAALISESTI)
- Genie, stop!

Ladies and gentlemen,

a warm welcome to Agrabah
old Jafarille!

Where were we now?

Yes. Gross humiliation.

- Down, my boy.
(ALWAYS)

Oh princess.

There's someone there
I want to introduce it to you.

Jafar. Do not touch her.

(SINGING) Prince Ali
Yes, it's him

But not as you know it

Read my lips
And face reality

Yes, meet a blast from your past

Whose lies were too good to last

Say Hello
To my beloved Prince Ali

Or should we say Aladdin?

Ali?

Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I am fair...

So Ali turns out to be
Simply Aladdin

Just a scam, should I continue

Believe me

His personality flaw

Give me a good enough reason

To send him packing
On a one-way trip

Nero!

So his outlook
Make a terminal dive

His assets frozen, location chosen
It's the end of the earth, oops!

- Goodbye!
- Goodbye, see you soon.

Former Prince Ali

(LAUGH MANIACLY)

(WIND HOWLS)

(SHIVERS)

Abu.

Abu!

(ABU MENU)

Oh, this is all my fault.

I should have released the spirit
when I had the chance.

I'm sorry, Abu.

I mixed it up.

Somehow I have to go back
and make things right.

Carpet.

-(ABU CHITTERS)
-(ALADDIN STRAIN)

Abu, start digging.

(frenzy panting)

That's it.

Yeah! Clear!

(GROAN)

Now back to Agrabah. Let's go.

- IAGO: The puppet master wants some biscuits?
(SULTAN'S MOAN)

Here are your cookies. Push them
always from the throat down.

Here. Get a lot.

Stop that. Jafar, leave him alone.

(GROWL)

It hurts me to see you
minus that, Jasmine.

A beautiful desert bloom
like you

should be most in the arm
powerful man in the world.

What do you say, darling?

Why, when you're the queen...

- Never.
(Kihlastunut murina)

I'm going to teach you respect.

(EXCITING)

Hey Genie.

I decided to make my last wish.

I wish Princess Jasmine

fall hopelessly in love with me.

JASMINE: Jafar.

I never realized how much
You are unbelievable beautiful.

Mmmm. It `s better.

Now the cat,

tell me more about myself.

You are tall, dark,

well dressed...

OH. AI, boyfriend.

Shh

Al, I can't help you.

I now work for Sefior Psychopath.
What are you going to do?

Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'm going to improvise.

JASMINE: Pretty small gaps
between the teeth.

Jack.

And your beard is so crooked.

- You stole my heart.
(flushes) Jafar...

(IAGO MUMPS)
- What about a street rat?

What street rat?

-(TO CLAP)
-(TEMPTATION)

(EXCITING)

BOTH: Yeah!

It was...

You!

How many times
should I kill you, my son?

Get a lamp.

No!

Ah, ah, ah, princess. Your time is up.

(GROWL)

Jasmine.

Nice picture Jaf...

Don't play with me.

Abu!

JAFAR: Things fall apart
hurry now, my boy.

(JAFAR NAURAA)

Understand?

(NAURA)

(STRETCH)

I'm just warming up.

Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

A snake, right?

Maybe you'd like to see
how much I can look like a snake.

(YELL)

(TO SING)
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake 'em

Insert this sword into this snake

Stay away from it.

Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... Great!

JASMINE: Aladdin.

(YELL)

Jasmine, wait.

(LAUGHS) You little idiot.

You thought you could win
the most powerful being on earth.

Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze it like... Awk!

Nero. Nero.

Geniuses have more power
which you will never have.

What?

He gave you your strength.
He can take it off.

Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

Admit it, Jafar.
You're still only in second place.

You are right.

His strength surpasses mine.

But not for long.

The boy is crazy.
He's a little drunk.

One shot too many with a snake.

Slave, I make my third wish.

I wish I was an almighty genius!

Fine, your wish is my command.
Well done, Al.

Joo.

Joo!

Power.

(JAFAR LAUGH)
(JASMINIIYSKÄ)

Absolute power!

- What have you done?
- Trust me.

The universe belongs to me
control!

Not so fast, Jafar.
Don't you forget something?

- Ai?
- You wanted to be a genius, you got it.

What?

And everything that goes with it.

- No no!
- I'm getting out of here.

ALADDIN:
Phenomenal Cosmic Powers...

You are a genius. I dont want...

Very small living space.

Al, you little genius, you.

- Ahh!
'(MIAU)

JAFAR: Shut your mouth
out of my face.

- IAGO: Oh, shut up, idiot.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

I can.

(IAGO shouts indistinctly)

JAFARI Shut up!

Jasmine...

I'm sorry for lying to you
about being a prince.

I know why you did it.

Well, I guess this is goodbye?

Oh this stupid law. It's not fair.

I love you.

(SNIFFS) It's okay.
You have one more wish left.

Sano vain sana
and you are a prince again.

Hey, it's just an eternity of slavery.

It's love.

Al, you won't find another girl
than him in a million years.

Believe me, I know. I looked.

Jasmine, I love you,

but i have to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

I understand.

Genius, I desire your freedom.

Real
the prince's pedigree is forthcoming.

- What?
- Genius, you're free.

I am free. I am free.

Quickly. Quickly.
Hope for something extraordinary.

Say, "I want the Nile."
Nile's wish. Try this.

- I hope for Niili.
- Never!

(NAURA JOLIE)

Oh, does it feel good! I see!

I am free! I'm finally free!

I'm about to hit the road.
I'm going to see the world. I am...

Genius, I am...

I will miss you.

Me too, Al. (SNIFFS)

No matter what anyone says,

you will always be a prince to me.

Properly.

You have certainly proven your worth
what comes to me.

This law creates a problem.

- Dad?
- Well, am I a sultan or am I a sultan?

From this day on,

the princess is getting married
which he considers worthy.

Him. I choose...

I choose you, Aladdin.

Call me Al.

Oh all of you, come here.
Big group hug.

Group hug.

Do you mind if I kiss a monkey?

Oh hairball.

Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

I'm leaving!

Goodbye, you two crazy lovebirds!

Hello, Rugman, ciao. I am the story.

No, I'm mythology.

I don't care what I am. I am free!

A whole new life

For you and me
