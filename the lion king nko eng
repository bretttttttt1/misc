Starting Point
{Open screen, black screen. Start nature sound effects. Castle screen. Fad to be black. A roaring lion roars in the background, beckoning the animals to gather at Pride Rock for a feast. Sunrise over the African grasslands (Light Wood), and the opening song to The Circle of Life}

Lebo M: Nantene Angonima Bagatti Baba

BS: Stu hm ingonima

{A variety of pictures of animals raising their heads at sunrise: bats, antelopes, satellites, mercury, starlings…}

Lebo M: Nantene Angonima Bagatti Baba

BS: Stuff hmm Angonian

Angonian

Lebo M: Sioya N'koba

BS: Angonian

'Angonima Nyong' enamabala

{rated 5x}

Ingonima Enugu on the left (Sata Ngwa!)

Ingonima Nengu Left Hand (Eshe!)

{Like 1x}

{The Circle of Life grounds in BS's and holds its model to eight sticks. It’s a piece of uncircumcised BS. Progress is in the medium range of strings. The flying saucers and cameras for African animals are all moving. Following Carmen Tewiley’s take on the Eighth Bar, we first watch the mice and then a long shot of each animal on their journey}

Carmen Twill: Since We Arrived on Earth

Also, rub your eyes and step back into the sun

There’s more to it than meets the eye

More things are possible than impossible.

{The camera drives the camera and flies to elephants, giraffes, lizards, birds, birds, etc… }

Carmen Twill: There's a lot to go from here

More available than unavailable

But the sun revolves overhead.

Sky Sapphire Street

It keeps increasing and decreasing in an infinite loop.

{When "the circle of life" is mentioned, the tall central pans on Pride Rock are where all the animals gather. Mephasa is on Pride Rock. Long camera arc towards Mufasa and Zazu.}

Carma Twilley: The circle of life.

And it brings us all back

{Zazu leans in front of Mufasa, who smiles and nods at him}

Carmen Twilley: Through Despair and Hope

For faith and love

{View of Rafiq, mint. He walks among the cattle that graze before him; Then he climbs Pride Rock to where Myfaza stands.}

Carmen Twill: Until we find our place

On the way to recovery

{Rafik and Mephasa hug each other.}

Carmen Twilley: In the Circle

The circle of life

{Decrease in BS. Carmen Twilley dropped out. Pan First takes the easy lead.}

{Murphas leads Rafik to Sarab, who is holding the Sabbath}

{The water and sand that Raviki collects is placed in front of Sinba-- the crown of the statue. He then takes the sabbatical and climbs up to the Pride Rock area. Next comes Mephasa and Sarab. With a crescendo in music and spoken word, the rafik held a simba for the crowd to watch.}

Carma Twilley: The circle of life.

{Animals start screaming, chasing each other, etc… }

Carmen Twill: And that brings us all back

Through despair and despair.

For faith and love

{The cloud point and the sunlight highlight Rafik and Sabi on Pride Rock.}

Carmen Twill: Until we find our place

{One by one, the audience bows.}

Carmen Twill: Quiet on the Road

{The camera gradually zooms in to a stunning view of the show.}

Carmen Twilley: In the Circle

The circle of life

{Bass drum hit (fff) and now switching to the black screen titled "The Lion King" with Blood Red.}

[Mouse/Entertainment Zone]
{show mouse sounds}

{The light is lost in the mouse in the cave}

{The mouse comes out and starts looking around in the light. He starts to snore. It's scary. Suddenly, the lion leg swooped down and grabbed him.

{Cue the Scar theme (uneven design, cold, gray). Fill slowly and refill during play}

{Change camera to Scar catching the mouse screaming and tugging at his leg. She talks to him and plays with him}

Scarlet: Isn't life fair? You see, I -- yes, I... will never be king. {exhale lightly} And you… will never see another day. {Closed mouth laughter. He begins to lick with the extension of his tongue} … Adieu… {quiet laugh}

Jasper: {Interrupting} Didn't your mom ever tell you to play with your kitchen?

Joyce: {Little puff. The mouse is under his feet.} What do you want?

Jasper: I'm here to make sure King Mephasa is on his way. {bows} …so you deserve a good head start on your party to forget this morning.

{The mouse runs away from Scrooge}

Scar: Now look, Zazu, let me have my lunch.

Zazu: Ha! You’ll give a lot of commands when the king comes to you. He’s as crazy as a dragon with the plague.

Scarlet: Ohh... I'm shaking with fear.

{On "FEAR" Scar smirks and bares his teeth at Jason.}

Zazu: {I'm so worried} Now, don't look at me like that... Help!

{Screw quickly flies up to the bird and grabs it in its mouth.}

Mephisto: {Immediately walking away and into the camera} Scar!

Jay: {mouth full} Mm-hmm?

Mephas: Leave it.

Zazu: {Speaking from Scar's door} Good morning, your majesty.

{Joy wipes the bird and covers it with saliva}

Jazoo: {Slimed} EYKCH.

Scar: {Circastellist sighs} Why! Unless my brother comes down from above and mingle with the public.

Mephasa : Sarabi and I didn't see you at the Samba TV show.

Jolly: {feigns surprise} Was that today? Oh, I'm just feeling bad.

{He turns around and starts smashing his fists into the rock wall. Zazu sighed audibly.}

Joyce: {Admiring his claws} ...It must have blown my mind.

Jasper: Yeah, well, simple mind you, as the king's brother, you should have been the first! {Scar snapped his teeth at Jasper, who flew right next to his face. Zazou covers for Mufasa on the front foot. Scar bent down to talk to her.}

Scarlet: Yeah, I was first in line... until Little Hair was born.

Mephisto: {Tilts his head and shakes his eyebrows} That "hair" is my son... and your king is coming.

Scar: Oh, I'm practicing my crusade. {Screw turns and leaves}

Mephaceous: {Warning tone} Don't turn your back on me, Scrooge.

Joy: {looking back} Oh, no, Mufasa. Maybe you shouldn’t follow me.

Mefasa: {Screams and jumps in front of Sirius, baring his teeth for the first time} Is that a problem?

Joel: Anger, anger. I wouldn’t dream of challenging you.

Zazu: Hey! why not?

Scar: {Looking at Zazu} Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's ten. But, when it comes to malevolent forces {looking at Moffat} …I’m afraid I’m at the basic end of the gene pool.

{Get out of wound}

Zazu: {Deep sigh} One in every family, man... Two in mine, actually. {perches on Mufasa's shoulder} And they can always ruin special moments.

Mephisto: What am I going to do about it?

Jasper: It makes the most beautiful rugs.

Mephasa: {Chidi} Jasper!

Jason: And just think! Whenever it got dirty, you could pull it out and beat it up.

{They leave laughing. Pan out to the open annual.}

[Plate Location]
{Rise in music-- "This Land" track-- with lyrics written in African flower, climaxing at the end of the song with choir and orchestral accompaniment. We see some rain moving slowly across the grounds. Multiplane as the thunderstorm rotates. The camera gets closer to Rafik’s baboon tree. The camera pans into the tree. Rafik is hands on the drawing board on the wall. We see that she has rounded up a lion cub.

Rafik: {Talks to himself, in which the word "Sibu" can be heard} Hmmm... Ahh he-he-he-hee-hee... {turns the cross on screen} Sibu.

{The bars and figures close the theme nicely with decrescendo. Fade to black to capture the boy image as a crossover to the Fade in at Pride Rock in the early morning}

[Sunrise Episode]
{There is a sibling visible from the rock. He ran down the hill and pounced on several of the lionesses, knocking over some.}

Sabi: Dad! mom ! Come on, Dad, we need to go. wake up!

Lioness: Omph!

Cibby: I'm sorry! …op.

{Cuba starts to wake Mefasa}

Sabi: Dad? mom. Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy--

Sarabi: {sleeping in Sibu's endless "mother" sound} Your son... is missing...

Mephas: {asleep too} Before dawn, he's your son.

Sabi: Dad? mom ! This mother! {tugs at Murphas' throat.} ​​Da-- Whoa!

{She grabs Mephacene's ear, she slips and falls into something off-camera. He then runs back into the screen and punches Mephasa. Mephisto sleeps in front of his son.}

Sabi: You made a promise!

Mephas: {looking at his son's impatience} Well, good. I stood up. I stood up.

Shiba: Yes!

{Mufasa yawns a written lion. Mufasa and Sarabi follow Simba to the top of Pride Rock. Sinba wrapped his arms around Sarabi, struggling to stay behind. She continues, with an expression of affection. The sunrise shines over Pride Rock and it’s stunning. Both Saba and Miphas are in the story. Music lyrics.}

Mephas: Look, Sabi. Everything the light touches is our salvation.

Sabi: Wow.

{The camera pans around them, during Mophasa’s speech, from a rear view to a forward shot.}

Mephasa: The time of a king’s reign rises and sets like the sun. One day, Siba, the sun will set on my time here and rise with you as the new king.

Sabi: And this is going to be all mine?

Mefaz: Everything.

Sabi: Light touches everything. {Sub looks around. overlooking rip-rap canyon to the north} How cool is that area?

Mephas: That’s beyond our borders. You should never go there again.

Sebastian: But I thought the king could do whatever he wanted.

Mephisto: Oh, there's more to being a king than... always getting your way.

{Murray begins to slide down the rock}

Sabi: {Awed} More time?

MFASS: {laughs} Cibby...

{Change camera. Mephasa and Sabu are walking on the savanna.}

Mephisto: Everything you see is similar, in a good amount. As a king, you need to understand that number and respect all the differences-- from the insect to the flying fox.

Sebastian: But Dad, don't we eat Ant?

Mefaz: Yes, Sabi, but allow me to explain. When we die, our bodies turn to dust. And termites eat grass. And thus we are connected to the greater circle of life.

Jasper: {light shines on a nearby rock} Good morning!

Mephas: Good morning, Jason.

Zazu: I'm coming in... with a morning report.

Mphas: Fire out.

Jason: Okay! The buzzing of the bees says the leopards are somewhere…

{Zazu’s speech continues unabated. The conversation between Saba and Myphanson is top notch.}

Mephasa: {Distracted} Oh really?

{Siba, named Jazz, flies over an oil and it explodes}

Jasper: {Continuing, ignoring Mufasa's lack of enthusiasm} ... and the grandmothers are going to continue this. Of course, the waters act like they’re above it all…

Mephisto: {To Simba} What are you doing, baby?

Sabi: {looking at empty foot with disgust} Pouncing.

Mephisto: Let an old pro show you how it's done.

Zazu: ...Birds beat elephants. I’ve told the elephants to ignore it, but they can’t…

Mephace: Jasper, are you blushing?

Jason: Yeah, man. {Continue immediately} Men are hard, but I always say…

Mephisto: {Whistles} Stay down.

Zazu: Yellows are never good…

Sabi: {whispering} Well, stay downstairs, no... yeah...

Jasper: {realizing something, it's not a coincidence} What's going on?

Mephasa: Bad lesson.

Jason: Oh, that’s great. Bonus. {Realizing} Ponx!?! Oh no man, you can't be serious...

{Mufasa motions for Zazu to return.}

Jasper: Ohh... that's embarrassing.

Mephace: {still mumbling} Try not to say.

Zazu: What do you say to him gently? {It looks like Saba and Mufasa lost.} Muffins? Simba?

{Shiba uses all kinds of punches to take Jasper to the ground}

MPHAS: Ha, ha, ha, ha. That's very good. Ha ha ha...

{A golfer appears under Jasper's picture.}

Gopher: Jasper!

Zazu: {Small} Yeah?

Gopher: {Greetings} Man! News from the Underground.

Mephas: {to Shiba} Now, this time--

Zazu: {Cut and fast} Witness! Festivals! Pride in the lands!

Mephisto: {Seresis now} Jasper, you're taking Saba home.

Sabi: Oh dear, can't I come?

Mephisto: {Curtis} No, baby.

{Murphy goes into his big jump}

Saba: I can never go anywhere.

Jasper : Oh, princess, one day you will be king; So you can chase those slobbering mangy stupid beasts from morning till night.

{They leave. The camera pans back to a wider view of Savannah.}

[Simba Series Wound Symptoms]
{Camera changes to Scar on his boiling rock. We see Scarlet Space once and have an old bone hammered into his mouth.}

{Day Cymbal}

Samba: Uncle Scar! Just think!

Scarlett: I don't discount games.

Sabi: I'm going to be the King of Proud Rock.

Joyce: {laughing} Oh good.

Sabi: {turning towards the marriage gate} My father has just shown me all the kingdoms; {greedily} And I'll keep it all. Huh, huh.

Scarlett: Yeah. Well… I’m sorry I didn’t jump for joy. Bad backside, you know.

{Jil collapses next to her.}

Simba: Hey will it, Scarlet? If I were a king, what would that make you?

Jelly: Monkey's grandfather.

Saba: Uh huh. You are so beautiful.

Scar: You have no idea. …So your father has shown you all the kingdom, hasn’t he?

Saba: Everything.

Scar: He didn't show you what's after the ascent to the northern border...?

Sabi: {Disappointed} Yeah, no... He said I couldn't go there.

Scarlet: And it's true. It’s too dangerous. Only wild lions go there.

Sabi: Yeah, I'm crazy! What's outside --

Scarlet: {Interrupting} No, I'm sorry, Sabi, I can't tell you.

Shiba: Why not?

Scar: Simba, Simba, I'm only looking out for my lively nephew.

{Ski pats Sabi's head and strokes him}

Sabi: {Snorts sarcastically} Yeah, of course, I'm your nephew.

Joyce: That was too much for me to protect... Shama's Tomb isn't the place for the prince's son... {faking surprise} Oops!

Sabi: {Enthusiastic} Elephant what? Wow.

Scar: {Faking dismay} Oh dear, I mean a lot... Yeah, I guess you'd know sooner or later you're smarter and all... {pulling Simba near} Oh, do me a favor - Promise me you’ll never go to the wrong place.

Sabi: {thinks} No problem.

Scarlet: There's a good boy. You are now running around and having fun. And remember… it’s our little secret. {Shiba leaves the marriage, and Scarlet leaves with a wry smile. Bad song.}

[Color Series - Watering Hole Series Introduction]
{Siba runs down the lower side of Pride Rock. He runs back to the two lionesses (Serbian and Sarafina). Sarafina is giving chocolate to Nala. The music is light, almost jazzy. Pan flux plane.}

Sabo: Hey there.

Nala: Thank you, Simba.

Sabi: Come on. I just heard about this beautiful place.

Nala: {Through strange teeth} Sabi! I’m in the middle of college.

Sarabi: And it's time for you.

{Siba tried (for a long time) to escape; Sarabi bent down and held it. It's giving the struggling baby a shot.}

Sabo: Mom! ...mom. You're breaking my skull.

{Sharb laughs.}

Sebastian: Well, okay, I'm honest. Can we go now?

Nala: So where are we going? You better not be anywhere stupid.

Sebastian: No, it’s pretty cool.

Sarabi: So where is this "good" place?

Sabo: Oh. {thinks} Whoa... surrounded by water.

Nala: Water well? What’s so great about a waterfall?

Sabi: {Through stray teeth} I'll show you when we get there.

Nala: {Wisher} Oh. {Normal} Whoa... Mom, can I go with Sabi?

Sarafina: Hmm... what do you think, Sarabi?

Sarabi: Well...

Nala and Sinba: {giving a wide, forced smile} Pleeeease?

Sarab: It's all right with me...

{Nala and Sabi are happy}

Nalla: Okay!

Shiba: Yes!

Sarabi: ...until Jasper goes with you.

{Seba and Nala stand in their cell}

Sabi: No, not Jason.

[Waterhole View]
{Camera angle of land slightly behind children walking towards water hole. Jasper is visible in the sky above.}

Zazu: Living Step. The sooner we get to the water’s edge, the sooner we can get out.

{Camera angle changes to kids from the original view immediately}

Nala: {Whisper} So where exactly are we going?

Sabi: {Wisher} Shama's grave.

Nala: Wow!

Cymbi: {whispers} Shhh! Zazu.

Nalla: {Wester} Right. So how do we place Dodo?

{Switches camera to slightly above Zazu. We hear the babies cooing up and downstairs}

Sabi: {whispering} Oh, I know how we can -

Jasper: {Flying down} Oh, just look at you two. Tiny seeds of love bloom in February. Your parents will be thrilled… {She dropped to them} …what about your engagement and all.

Sabi: Bye-what?

Jason: Married. intended. Affinity.

Nala: Meaning...?

Jasper: {as he grabs her by the collar} One day, you two will get married!

Sabo: Yuki!

Nalla: Ewww.

Sabi: I can't marry her. He’s my friend.

Nala: Yes. That would be amazing.

Jazz: Well, I'm sorry to bust your butt, but you don't have a choice with your two hands. It’s a tradition…

{Shiba imitates Zazu with those last words}

Zazu: ...Going back generations.

Sabi: Yeah, if I were the king that would be the first thing to go.

Zazu: As long as I’m there.

{starting with the "I can't be king" beginning}}

Sebastian: Well, then you're fired.

Jasper: Hmmm... Well, but only a king can do that. {From Shabby Nose Pocket}

Nala: Yes, he is the future king.

Sabi: Yeah. {Thumping Zazu's chest} So you have to do what I tell you.

Zazu: Not yet I don’t. And with this sort of thing, I’m afraid you’d be a pretty sensitive angel.

Simba: Humph. That's not the way I see it.

{Full song, the colors change to African pop. The wallpaper suddenly becomes realistic, cartoonish style with bright colors.}

Sabi: I'm going to be a strong king.

So beware, enemies!

Zazu: Well, I've never seen King of Bengal.

With a little hair

{It removes the baby hairs, where the hair would be}

{Siba gets a leaf}

Simba: I'm going to be Minnie.

Like no king ever before.

{He climbs a tree}

Symbolic: I'm looking down at my wing.

I'm working on my ROAR

{On "ROAR" he yells at Jasper, luring him to a back post}

Jason: {holding up what looks like a hanging towel} So far, something uninspiring

{The camera moves to the back; It depicts "Servant" as the tail of a red elephant that beats Jasper in the butt like a golf ball, sending him flying like a stone across a body of water; The boys are right behind him now.}

Sabi: Oh, I can't be a king!

Zazu: {talking} You've got a long way to go, young master, considering...

{For this verse Zazu gives quick answers for each line. Sinba and Nala are on either side of Zazu, and when he turns to talk to one, the other makes faces at him.}

Sabi: Nobody's telling you to do this.

Jasper: [Now that I said that, I -]

Nala: No one is saying it's there.

Zazu: [That’s what I meant…]

Sabi: Nobody can say stop that.

Zazu: [See, what you don’t understand…]

Simba and Nala: No one says anything here.

Zazu: [Watch it here now!]

Sabi: Free to escape at any time

{Cymbia and Nala are now in Owl}

Zazu: [Well, it sure depends...]

Shabby: Be myself all the way!

Zazu: {jumps in front of the kids, turns around and talks to them, so you don't have to pay attention to them}

I think it's time you and I

Prepare the heart for the heart

{jumps into the trap}

Sabi: Parents don't need advice

From small groups initially

{Jazer's light on a tree branch}

Zazu: If this is the way of the kingdom.

Count me in!

Outside of work, outside of Africa,

I wasn’t going to get close… aw!

{The camera pulls back to reveal that Zazu has turned on the light on a tree that is washing towards a river. She disappears at the door. Zazu screams in surprise, but quickly reappears and leaps towards and through the camera.}

Jason: This kid is coming out of his shell

Sabi: Oh, I can't be a king!

{The children are going into a hut which they have built; When Zazou comes after him, they all retreat, and Zazou covers himself with a wing.}

{Nala and Simba dance under the elephants while the African Band leads a brief sequence. Zazu flies up and looks for them. The symbiote eventually stands on the demon's head.}

Simba: Everyone looks left

Everyone is struggling.

{Jazer screams like an animal tortures him}

{Zimbia jumps over the cliff tops}

Sabi: Everywhere you look is me.

Standin' in the light!

{Playing on Jurassic Language in Fun Mode}

Zazu: {speaking, but in real time} Now!

Chorus: Leave all creatures and sing.

We heard it in the herd and on the wing.

That would be King Sabi's best flight

{The pictures cover the mouths of hippos, pigs, bears, giraffes, birds of prey, etc. all forming a pyramid with babies on top}

Simba & Chorus: Oh, I can't be a king!

Oh, I can't do the king!

Oh!

{The pyramid falls, leaving Pig sitting on Zazoo.)

Jasper: {Muffled} I'm sorry, ma'am, but... Stop! Simba? Naloaaa!

[Elephant Tomb - Mercy View]
{Switch camera to Sinba and Nala moving out of the way with Zazu. They’re laughing.}

Sabi: Okay, it worked!

Nala: We ruined it.

Sabi: {whispers} I... am a genius.

Nala: Hey, Janice, it was my idea.

Sabi: Yeah, but I took it out.

Nala: With me!

Sabo: Oh yeah? ...RARR!

{Sib comes flying; They get along very quickly. Nala finally comes on top and grabs Sinba by the front foot, making a resounding kick.

NLA: Ha. pin u.

Sabo: {angrily} Hey, wake me up.

{Nala turned away with a smile. Sabi sees her and jumps on her again. Together they run down a short hill. Will post it in the same place in another post.}

Nalla: Ping you talk.

{The Geyser makes a loud noise nearby, letting out a roar. The camera pans back to a surrounding scene that the children have just observed. Mostly made of dust, we see a black cave filled with elephant bones. Bad music.}

Sabi: This is it. We did it.

{They look at the shelter they're on. Nearby is a large elephant’s head. Camera follows to watch the whole heavy scene.}

Simba and Nala: Wow!

Nala: It’s really scary.

Sebastian: Yeah... Isn't that great?

Ella: {Relishing her naughtiness} We could be in big trouble.

Sabi: {love it too} I know, huh.

Nala: {looking at the skull} I wonder if the skull is still there.

Sabi: {Walking towards the skull} There's only one way to find out. come on. Let's go take a look.

{Sub walks to the side of the head. Zazu suddenly appeared in front of them and yelled "WRONG!" and give the audience a beginning.}

Jason: The only observation you make is your observation here.

Saba: Absolutely not.

Zazu: We have crossed the boundaries of the Pride Cities.

Sabo: Hh. see. The banana tree was frightened. Hey.

Zazoo: {punching Simba's nose} That's a mouthful of Mr. Bananas for you, a mistake. And now we are in real danger.

{Cymbia approaches the skull entrance}

Cibby: Danger? Hah! I walk near the forest. I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha ha! (After Ciba stops laughing, we hear more laughter inside the skull. Ciba runs back and forth behind Nala and Jasper. Three gouges come out of the skull’s eyes and mouth.)

Senji: Well, well, very good. What have we got here?

Banza: Hmm. I don't know, breast. Whoa... What do you think, Eddie?

Ed: {laughs madly}

{They circle around Jasper.}

Banzai: Yeah, that’s what I was thinking. Three bullies!

Zazu: And by the way, let me confirm for you. A simple navigational error. Ehhhh...

Senji: Whoa, whoa, wait, wait... I know you. {peering closer into the camera} You’re Mephaza’s little boy.

Zazu: My lady, I am the elder king.

Banzai: {looking at Sabi} And that makes you...?

Sabi: The king is coming.

Senator : Do you know what we do with angels who leave their kingdom?

Sinba: Pooh. There’s nothing you can do to me.

Jasper: Huh... Technically they can. We are their village.

Simba: But Zazu, you told me they were nothing but stupid hunters.

Zazu: {aside, covertly, to Sinba} No;

Banzai: Who are you calling "opening-city?!?"

Jasper: {Harrian} No, no, no. Look at the sun. {Starts to hurry the boys} It's time to go!

Shenji: What is speed? He wants you to join us for dinner.

Banzai: Yes! Anything we can find... surround the "image"! {Later} Got it? Around a lion?!?!?!? {laughs}

Senji: Oh wait, wait, wait. I got one, I got one. Make mine a "cube" sandwich. What do you think?

{Uncontrolled laughter. Ed jumps up, gestures, and speaks.}

Senji: What? Ed? What is that?

Banzai: (points to where Eddie is standing) Hey, did we order this dinner before?

Senji: No, why?

Banzai: 'Cause there he goes! (The camera pans to the sight of the children fleeing, and they stop shortly after. Quick camera pan showing Zazoo caught in mid-flight.)

Nala: Did we destroy them?

Sabi: I think so. Where’s Zazu?

(Camera switch. Zazu holds Sally by the dust window. Banzai holds the bird.)

Banzai: Little bird Majordom Hippity beaten to a crispy bird. {She pushes Zazu away to the window and climbs inside and knocks.}

Zazu: Oh, no! Not a birdie! {He takes it off in a heat}

{The audience starts laughing hysterically}

Sabi: {Now near the mice} Hey! Why not choose someone at your own level?

Rain: Like... you?

Sabo: Yeah.

{Slivia starts looking for the babies. They run behind them and bow their heads in a gust of wind.}

Senji, Banzai, Ed: Bo! {laughter}

{The slimes ask the babies to move and sit on another ridge, and the babies switch when they move to this ridge. They expose the end of the spine and descend to the bones.}

Nala: Sinba!

{Shiba turns around and is horrified to see Nala walking past the cliff.}

Nalla: Awww!

{Simba runs back boldly and kicks Senji, drawing blood and sweating as Nala runs off. Senji is furious, and the rats quickly find the babies and put them in a cave.}

Banzai: {Enter the club, smiling} Here, Katie, Katie.

{Siba tries to cry. It makes a nice scream.}

Sabo: Meriovo!

Senji: Oh-huh... Is that it? Huh. Do it again… Come on.

{Siba covers his mouth and screams again, but we hear a lion roar.}

Mephas: (behind the scenes) Rovor!

Senji, Banzai, Ed: Huh?!

{Murray shoots rats at the camera and beats them until they're crushed in the background.}

Sensei: Oh, please, I will. nephew. nephew.

Banzai: Owen. Yes. Yes.

Mephasa: {Half Moon} Shut up!

Banzai: Oh, we're going to bed now.

Senji: Calm down. We are very, very sorry.

Mephasa: If...you...don't...get...my...head...

Rain: Oh this is... is this your son?!?

Banza: Oh, your son?

Senji: Did you know that?

Banzai: No... me? III was unknown. No. Did you do that?

Senji: No! Of course not.

Banjay: Nope.

Senji and Banzai: Ed?

Ed: {Yeah for stupid reasons}

{Murphas cries}

Banzai: Tools!

{With the sound of a gun they disappear. Zazu turns on the light in front of Mufasa, for the purpose of "that'll show 'em"... but then it withers in front of an angry Mufasa.}

Sabi: {approaches his father} Because I.

Mphas: Thank you for thinking.

Cibby: Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.

Mephisto: {Sternly} Let's go home.

{They all start to leave the sleeping area, the babies bowing in embarrassment.}

Nala: {whispers} I think you're so awesome.

{Camera looks at a cave wall. It stops at a menacing portrait of Scarlett standing over a building where he used to watch the deaths of babies.}

[Rainbow - Star Chain]
{Switch camera from Savannah. The children walk shyly behind Mufasa. Jasper in between jumps.}

Mphas: {Still} Zazu?

Zazu: {jumps forward and turns on the light in front of Mufasa, his fear showing} Yeah, man?

Mephasa: {Stern} Take the egg home. I need to teach my son a lesson.

{The camera watches the children. Samba falls into the grass as if to hide. Jasper flies back to the kids.}

Zazu: Come on, nalla. Sabi... {places his horns on Sabi's neck, lets out a sigh of relief, then sighs} Good morning.

{Jasser and Nala leave. The camera view is of Sinba in the foreground and Mufasa facing the camera from behind.}

Mephisto: {Calling out, even harder, he doesn't look at Sabu} Saba! {The word shimmers in the night air.}

{Sub turns slowly and walks towards his father. The camera follows him forward. Bad song, but happy. Simba gasped in pain. He looked down and saw that his heel was embedded in his father’s footprint. Very difficult time for Saba. It is conveyed to the audience that his father could have easily done a lot more, a lot more than teaching him. It also turns out Sabi has bigger shoes to fill, and is only now securing his role. Sabi reminds him a lot of how small and tiny he is compared to his father. He looks up and steps forward frantically.}

{Murphy thinks silently for a few moments without looking at his son. Then he turns to her.}

Mphas: Sibi, I'm so disappointed in you.

Sabi: {softly and cheerfully} I know.

Mephisto: {Continued} You could have been killed. Thank you for my wisdom. And worst of all, you put Nala in danger!

Sabi: {Bordering on crying, voice cracks} I was just trying to be nice to you.

Mephas: I wonder if that's what I'm supposed to be doing. Sibling… Being kind doesn’t mean you go looking for trouble.

Sebastian: But you're not afraid of anything.

Mephas: I was today.

Sabi: {in disbelief} You were?

Mephisto: Yeah... {moves closer to Saba} I thought I might lose you.

Sabo: Oh. {Lightening slightly} I suppose even parents are afraid?

MPHAS: Mm-mmm.

Sabi: {conversationally} But you know what?

Mephas: {again} What?

Sabi: I think those years were pretty scary.

Mephisto: {good laugh} 'Cause nobody compares to your father. Come here.

{Murphy sighed. He picks up a syrup and gives it a nugget.}

Shiba: Oh, no, no... Ah! Errgh!

{The music picks up and Simba and Mufasa playfully fight for a moment.}

Sabi: Oh, come here... {as Mephasa runs away} Heh! Gocha!

{They end up with Mephasa lying down with Sabi on top of him}

Sabi: Dad?

Mphas: Hmm?

Sabi: We're friends, right?

Mefaz: {Good laugh} Absolutely.

Sebastian: And we'll always be together, right?

Mephisto: {Sit down, Sabu now, Sabu, Sabu... I'll tell you something my father told me... Look at the others. The archangels looked down on us with some.

Sabi: {Awed} Really?

Mephas: Yes... So, when you feel low, remember that those angels will always be there to guide you... and so will I.

[Prepare yourself]
{Camera shifts from the stars to the Cave of Mercy. As we enter the cave, we first hear Banzai's voice and eventually see Banzai and Ed together with Senji nearby.}

Banzai: Man, that fucking metaphor! I won’t be able to sit still for a week! {We see a lot of Mowazan after Banza}

Ed: {laughs}

Banzai: That's not funny, Eddie.

Eddie: {Tries to stop laughing, but it's getting worse}

Banza: Hey, shut up!

Eddie: {I can’t stop laughing}

{Banzai plays Ed, and they begin to fight.}

Senji: Would you hit him?!

{The band stops. Eddie continues to drag himself to his feet.}

Banzai: Well, he started!

Senji: Look, guys. It’s no wonder we’re at the bottom of the food chain.

Banzai: {Ni drool drips from his mouth} Man, I hate it.

Shenji: Lee? You know, if it weren’t for these lions.

Banzai: Yes. Man, I hate lions.

Senji: So it sucks.

Banzai: And the hair.

Senji: And the smell.

Banjay: And man, they are.

Senji and Banzai: UuuugLY! {laughter}

Scar: {From his perch} Oh, sure, not all of us lions are evil.

Banzai: Oh. {relieved of surprise} Oh, Scrooge, it's you.

Rain: We were afraid it was someone important.

Banzai: Yeah, you know, like Mephasa.

Shenji: Yes.

Scarlett: I understand.

Banzai: Now that's power.

Rain: Tell me. I just hear that name and I shudder.

Banzai: Mephasa.

Shenji: {shaking} Oooh. …Do it again.

Banzai: Mephasa.

Senji: Oooh!

Banzai: Mephasa. Maphasa! Maphasa!

Senji: {Suppresses ugly laughter} ...Oooh! It makes me angry.

Scarlet: I'm surrounded by idiots.

Banzai: You're not, Scrooge; I mean, you’re one of us. I mean, you’re our friend.

Scarlet: {Sarcas} Char.

Rain: Oh, I like that. He’s not a master, but he’s still pretty good.

Banzai: Yes. Hey hey. Have you brought us any food, Scar, old friend, old friend? Huh? Are-you-you-you-you?

Scar: I don't think you deserve this. {Holds out a zebra haunch.} I’ve been holding these little babies for you. {Drops leg to Hyenas} And you couldn’t let them go. {beginning of preparation}

Shenzi: {whispering as the door opens} Well, you know. It wasn't like they were alone in Chicago.

Banzai: Yes. What should we do-- {chuckles} Kill Mephasa?

Jill: Right.

{Three Sally's stop eating and look at Scara questioningly.}

{Three-top flutter to Scar's flight to the heavens.}

{Scar walks calmly through the fire and gas off-camera above the start of the song}

{Scar walks slowly around Ed, who is mixing up the remaining lamb legs}

Jolie: {singing continues} I know your catching ability.

They were as wet as after summer.

But be strict, be careful.

My words are praise.

It's so obvious from your empty words

Not all lights are up.

{On 'Pay attention', Scrooge angrily throws a bone; Ed suddenly comes to attention}

{She twists her leg in front of Ed's blank stare and explains her point, Ed's tongue sticks out}

Scar: But we're talking about kings and heirs.

Even you can’t catch what you don’t know!

{Sanji and Banza are laughing on a ledge behind him; on "you," Scar turned and leaped at them, throwing them backwards onto a pair of geysers, which exploded, flinging two ghouls into the air.}

{In the next prediction, Jolly is dramatically pressed against a mast that rotates to the floor.}

Gilly: So get ready for the opportunity of a lifetime.

Get ready for exciting news!

A bright new era!

Are the legs shorter?

Rain: And where do we show up?

Gillie: {grabbing Senji's cigarette} Listen to what the teacher is saying.

{Senji rubs his now red cheek}

Scarlet: I know it sounds good.

But you will benefit

When I was given my privileges

And destruction is fun.

Get ready!

{Scar jumps up next to Ed, who is grabbing Bone again, and here he jumps out of the ledge}

{The three snakes fall into the bones and sink into the water; They reappear, each with a different skull symbol on their head.}

{expression}

Banzai: Yeah, be prepared. Yeah-hey... We'll get ready, hey. ...For what?

Jill: Because of the king’s death.

Banza: Why? Was he sick?

{Scar holds bandage around his neck}

Scarlet: No, fool - we'll kill him. And Saba too.

{puts the bag down}

Sensei: Great idea! Who needs a king?

Senji (and then Banzai): {Singing-singing voices, dancing around Banzai} No king! No king! La-la-la-la-lo!

Jolly: Fairies! A messenger is coming!

Banzai: Yeah, but you said, uh...

Scarlet: I'm going to be king! …Stay with me {triumphant, toothy grin}, and you’ll never go hungry again!

Senji and Banzai: Yay! all right! Long live the king!

{Camera shows hundreds of other monkeys in shadow.}

All forgets: Blessed be the king! Long live the king!

{full song again}

{Scar's army of hyenas is passing through the bottom of the hill, which is now a Nazi-esque quadrangle}

Snake: {in harsh words and phrasing}

Excited to be reunited soon.

with a King who always worships.

Scarlet: Of course, a quid pro quo awaits you.

To perform certain operations in the cluster

{waving something around belly}

Jolly: The future is full of rewards.

And even though I’m a big talker

The part I need to focus on is

You won't get a sucker without me!

{She flies into her frying room and lets out a terrible howl; That snake will fall into the pit of fire}

{Throughout the next storm, a flock of mice comes together to dance, leap over boulders, and shake animal bones in the light, one playing a horn / xylophone.}

{Paralpati temples are the chanting centers of the spirits}

Ivory (& Yellow): So get ready for the turn of the century!

(Oh!)

Be prepared for scams

(Oooh... ON! ON! ON!) {Back End Punk}

Careful planning;

(We get food!)

Patience to

(More food)

A decade of denial.

(We'll be back)

Where am I going?

(Infinite Meat)

Be a king without dispute.

(Aaaah…)

Sincerely, regards

(…aaaaah…)

And I’m amazing!

(…Aaaah!)

Yes, my teeth and braces are showing.

(O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o)

Get ready!

Everyone (even Ed): Yes, our teeth and gums are clean -

Get ready!

{Close with fill and return. Scar and the mice laugh hysterically. The horn rises into a column that matches the opening of the panorama in the next section.}

[Stamdy Place]
{Switches camera to a view of a large cavern. The shadows of the clouds gradually pass over the landscape.}

Scarlet: Now you wait here. May your father perform a miracle for you.

{Switch camera to the bottom of the valley. Scar and Sabi are near a rock under a small tree.}

Cymbi: Ohhh. What is that?

Scarlet: Wouldn't that be a surprise if I told you?

Sabi: If you told me, I wouldn't believe it.

Scar: Ho ho ho. You’re a bad boy.

Sinba: Come on, Grandpa Scar.

Gilly: No-no-no-no-no. This is just for you and your dad. You know, a father-son… thing.

{Through Shiba’s expression, we see that he’s annoyed at Scar’s actions, but soon challenges him.}

Scarlet: Okay! Well, mine, hers.

Sabi: I'll go with you.

Scarlet: {Loud, Pat} No! {recover the compound} HHHHHHHHHHHHHhh. No, just keep going on this rock. You don’t want to end up in another mess like you did over the holidays…

Sabi: {Shocked} You know that?

Scarlett: Everyone in Saba knows that.

Sabi: {muffled and embarrassed} Really?

Scarlett: Oh yeah. Mom was there to save you, right? {expressing self-satisfaction; he puts a paw on Simba's shoulder} Oh... and just between us, maybe you want to work on your little voice. Hmm?

{The ghost starts to appear}

Simba: Ohhh... Okay...

{Skaar finishes stroking Sabo's head.}

Saba: Hey Uncle Scarlet, do I have a surprise?

Jolie: {back over his shoulder} Sinba, that's a death sentence.

{Camera slowly moves to the side of the valley and away from Scar and Sinba. After a long rock we reach the entrance and have a great view of the forested Tesca; The size of the animal is proportional to the generated computer. The camera then focuses on the mice (Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed) waiting patiently at the zoo, hiding under a rock.}

Banjay: {bird cries}

Senji: Shut up.

Banzai: I can’t help it. I'm so hungry... {jumping up} I gotta get some ice cream!

Rain: Stay put.

Banzai: Well... can't I just take one of the minor patients?

Senji: No! We are waiting for a signal from Scar.

{Camera switches to a rock formation in view of the prayers}

Senji: There it is... {makes an evil face, it looks funny} Let's go.

{Switches camera to Simba}

Sabi: Little cry. Phi!

(A fetus is beginning to develop. He screams it.}

Sabo: Mero!

{The game does not respond to this initial request. The shark then flies down and tries again.}

Saba: Marion-H!

{On her third attempt, Simba pulled her close again and gasped for breath.}

Sabo: Meroo!!

{The shark jumps on the screen. Sabi's screams echo around the canyon. Sinba lifted his ears and enjoyed the echo. However, the echo is quickly drowned out by a low, low tone. Sinba looked down and saw boulders flying. Check out the infamous "To Die For" musical. We see the animals coming to the edge of the canyon. Multiple layers of the camera zoom in on Simba’s terrified face. Saba stands in front of the audience.}

{Cut to the edge of the lake, where the rats are seen crawling under the bushes, biting their legs to drag them to the bottom of the bushes. The camera switches to Mephisto and Jazer a short distance from the canyon.}

Zazu: Oh look, the animals are walking.

Mephas: Because... (the demon jumps up and gasps for breath)

Joel: Mephis. quick. Symbol. in the river. Sabo is down there!

Mephasa: Cibby?

(The camera switches to Sinba. He runs up a dead tree. Zazu flies past Mufasa and Scar, down into the valley. He sees Sinba.)

Sabi: {clinging to a tree} Jasper! Help me!!

Jasper: Your father is on his way! hold on!

Shiba: (stunned) Hurry up!

{Murray and Scar are at the bottom edge of the garage. Jazer flies back to Mephasa and points out where Shiba is.}

Zazu: There! there! On that tree!

Mephisto: Think of it, Sabi!

{In the background, there's a forest on a cypress tree that's breaking.}

Sabo: Ahhh!

{Murph runs out of the cattle and joins the group.}

Zazu: Oh Scar, this is terrible. What are we doing? What are we doing? Heh... coming back for help, that's what I'm doing, I'm coming back a--oomph!

{Scar backhands Zazu into a rock wall, knocking him unconscious. Jelly then follows Muphasa’s advance from the valley’s edge, his shadow cast mysteriously from the valley floor. Mephasa runs with the animal until it passes the tree just a little. It passes in front of some bushes and runs through the field towards a cypress tree. He was hit once in the head and thrown to the ground. One of the dogs knocked over the fig tree and threw the fig into the air. Mephasa wakes up in time to catch Sabu in the air in his mouth. She strikes again and throws Simba unconscious. Simba dodges a few dogs coming towards him. Mephasa ran with the animal and caught up with Saba. He tries to fly to a nearby rock and lay down the sab, but a wild boar immediately knocks him out and charges towards him.}

Sabi: Mom!

(Shiba looks on in horror, unable to find his father in the thick undergrowth below him. At the last second, Mufasa flies out of the cave and begins to climb with great difficulty on the hard rock. Shiba turns and begins to climb Up until the top of the valley, Muphasa had reached the lowest point now in sight of Sinba. Due to the steepness of the climb, his feet are not on the upper ledge.)

Mephasa: Bloody! Jay-- {slips, barely hanging on} Brother! Help me!

{Scar looks down disdainfully, then smiles in front of Mufasa with legs wide. Mufasa screams, due to the sudden pain of Scar's claws, but no doubt also due to the sudden flash of realization. His face slowly changes to one of horror as he learns of Scarlet's intentions.}

Joyce: (shocked and disgusted) Blessed be the king. (Seki throws his brother back. Mephasa falls of his own accord, back first. The camera follows Mephasa from a shot from above, showing the show happening below.)

Mephasa: {screaming}

{The camera suddenly focuses on Simba, who is looking down at his father. Sound has no effect on the beat. It also has no appearance. The cries of Mephasa and Shiba are mixed.}

Sabi: No ooh!!!! (Everyone walks by. Everything is dusty. Saba heads to the bottom of the canyon. Mephasa is nowhere to be seen.)

Shiba: {coughs} Dad!!

{We hear a noise}

Sabo: {quietly} Dad?

{We see a wild goose running past, which is the source of the sound. The balls curve around a tree at the bottom of the valley. Mephaza is under the tree, lying down next to it. Not moving or breathing. Simba approached the body. Sad musical theme. Again, notice how small Breast is.}

Shiba: {hopefully} Mom? ...Mom, come on. {She wipes Mephasa's eye. The head rotates in place only after a blow} You gotta up. {places both his foreheads on his father's shoulders and hugs him} mother. We need to go home. {Pushes Mephacene's ears. The head sometimes moves on its own. Sabi runs for a bit, obviously very scared.} HEEEELP!!!! someone! {Her voice rises from the ancient caverns.} Anyone... Help.

{She cries. Simba turned back to the body. He ducks under his feet for his father to hold him. Stop by to take advantage.}

{The "Mufasa" theme gives way to more sinister words as Scar's figure advances out of the ashes.}

Jelly: Simba. ...what did you do?

Sabi: {Jumps back, crying} There was the forest and he tried to save me... It was an accident, I... I didn't want to do it.

Scar: {Embracing Simba, still moving away} Honestly, truthfully, you don't know. Nobody… Never before {pulls Simba close; Sinba hides his face in Scar's front foot to allow these things to happen. …But the king is dead. {Looking with mock regret at Simba) And if you hadn't, he'd still be alive. {Siba was destroyed, according to his guilt. Another thought "occurs" to Scar.} Oh! What’s your mom thinking?

Sabi: {Sniffs} What am I going to do?

Scarlet: Run, Saba. Run… run and never go back.

{Sub runs around blindly, obviously broken. For a moment, the crowd holds its breath. The music ends. Three deaths appear from behind Scrooge.}

Joel: Kill him.

{The mice rise up after him; Blood stands still, not moving. Simba has been chased the entire length of the river. He reaches the threshold, only to see a sharp point on the other side. Having no choice, he flies off and falls into a tree trunk on the ground. Tears search all the way. As they run down towards the offices, they find Benz and he starts to run away.}

Banzai: Wow!!

{Banzai managed to stop him just above the dog. He breathes a sigh of relief. Senji and Eddie then run after him and toss him into the bushes.}

Banshee: Yow! {Jumps out of the grass}

{Senji and Eddie laugh}

Senji: {sees Shinba walking out of the far side of the tree and onto the desert} Hey-- there he goes! There it goes!

Banzai: {baring his teeth} Then go get it.

Senji: There’s no way I’m going in there. What, you want me to get out of there like that? Cactus butter?

Banzai: {Smashing flies in Eddie's face in laughter; Eddie lets out a small cry of pain} We need to finish the job.

Senji: Well, it's as good as dead right there anyway. And if he comes back, we’ll kill him.

Banzai: (screaming) Yes! You hear that? If you come back, we will kill you!!!

("Kill ya" plays as we see Simba running through the desert. The Heroes make their way over the mountains back to the Pride Lands.)

Address and Channel Diagrams.
{Camera switches to a wound for moonlit lionesses on Pride Rock.}

Joel: Mephasa’s death is tragic; But lost Simba, who didn't start feeding.

{The camera pans around the lionesses. Some of them and Zazu are comforting Sarabi, while Nala is touching his mother's feet and weeping.}

Joyce: ...For me, it's a form of self-torture. It is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne. Yet, when this terrible tragedy is over, we will rise to greet a new day... {The snake starts to come out, sprouts green shadows, and laughs} ...Jay and the Snake meet, Therefore, the year Great and easy customers! {Scar ascends Pride Rock as the rats emerge in full force.}

{The camera pans to Rafik, who is shaking his head in the distance. The unit rotates with the ref in the same position. He lives in his tree house. After wiping away the tears, she reached back and rubbed her hand over the painting of the child. The camera shifts. The painting is smeared on Simba in the hot desert sun.

[Busar - Hakuna Matata Series]
{The dogs are circling the boy's body. One then goes down completely. They whirl around him. As the music plays, a Timon Pumba sculpture appears and lands in the middle of the dogs. They beat and kick the dogs.}

Tim: Yeah! Get out! Get out! Get out of here! Wow!

Pongboy: I like it! Running for the lions!

Timon: {laughs, detached} He always gets them.

Pumbaa: {looking at Sabi} Uh-oh. Hi, Timmon. You better come check it out. I think he’s still alive.

Timmon: Eigh...

{Timon walks in front of Sabi, who is lying down with his feet over his face.}

Tim: Well, what have we got here? {She smells like cigars}

{He tries to lift Sabi's leg. He can't. He moves forward and upwards with a big splash. It looks like a Sabi interface.}

Tim: Gee, that's a lion! {Jumps on Ponbo} Run Ponbo! Shake it!

Bombay: Hey, Tim. It is a small lion. Take a look. She’s so beautiful, alone! Can we handle it?

Timon: {Screaming in Pumbaa's ear, it creates a noisy soundtrack} Pumbaa, are you an influence? We’re talking about something else. Lions eat men like us.

Pumbaa: But it’s very small.

{He leans back to look at Simba, and accidentally drops Timon on his head.}

Tim: It’s growing.

Pumbaa: {he sees Timon's reflection on the floor, smiling) Maybe he'll be on our side.

Timmon: Uh--huh! That’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. Maybe b-- ...hey, I get it! What if he is near us? You know, having a lion isn’t a bad idea.

Pumbaa: So we let him?

Timon: Right. Whose brain is in this outfit?

{Pumba takes Sabha on his teeth}

Pongboy: Huh...

Tim: Exactly. Jeesh, I'm drunk. Let's go out here and get some shade.

{Pumbaa leaves with Timon on his back and picks up Simba.}

[Hakuna Matata Episode]
{Switch camera to Pumbaa, Timon, and near the Sinba River and Oasis. Saba was lying near the water. Timon threw water in Sinba's face. Sabo moves.}

Tim: Are you okay, son?

Sabi: I think so.

Pumbaa: You're dying.

Timon: I saved you.

Pumbaa: {eats thyme}

Tim: Well, the pomposity helped. a little.

Cibby: {Dil} Thank you for your help.

{Simba walks easily to the man.}

Tim: Hey, where are you going?

Cibby: Nowhere.

Timon: {looking at Sinba, talking to Pumbaa} Gee. It looks like blue.

Pumbaa: I would say golden brown.

Timmon: No, no, no. I want to beat him up.

Bombay: Ohhh. {trots up to Simba} Baby, what's eating you?

Tim: Nothing; It’s at the top of the food chain! (laughs) Food Cha-hay! {Pumba and Simba watch in silence} (laughs) Ahem. {Realizing his joke flopped} So, where are you coming from...?

Sabi: Who cares? I can't go back.

Tim: Ahh. You’re a hero! That’s good for us, too.

Pumbaa: What's going on, kid?

Sabi: Something bad. But I don’t want to talk about it.

Tim: Okay. We don't want to hear about it.

Pumbaa: {To Timon} Come on, Tim. {To Simba} Can we do something?

Sabi: Unless you can change the past.

Pumbaa: You know, kid these days, my friend Timon here would say, "You've got to turn your back on your past..."

Tim: {raises hands} No, no, no.

Ponbo: I mean...

Tim: Lovely. Sleep before you hurt yourself. {to Simba} It's "You have to put your past behind you." Look at him, baby. Bad things happen, and you can’t do anything about it, right?

Sabi: Right.

Timon: {pinches Simba's nose} WRONG! If the world turns its back on you, turn your back on the world.

Sabi: Yeah, that’s not my education.

Tim: Then maybe you need a new lesson. Sit behind me. {Clears throat} Haku Matata.

Sabi: {Still tired} What?

Pumbaa: Ha-ku-na ma-ta-ta. It means "without worry."

{Full song, except Marimba Music}

Timon: Hakuna Matata!

Very good point

Pumbaa: Hakuna Matata!

Crazy doesn’t pass.

Tim: It means don’t worry.

Sinba: Hakuna Matata?

Pumbaa: Yes, that’s our theme.

Sabi: What's a motif?

Tim: Nothing! What is mote for you? Ah ha ha ha...

Pumbaa: {Laughing} You know son-- those two words will solve all your problems.

Tim: That's it! Take apples, for example.

{BACK TO MUSIC}

Tim: Why when he was a toddler…

Pumbaa: {Italian counter-tenor range} When I was a kid Warren was hoooog!

Tim: {speaking, wipes ear} Very interesting.

Ponbo: Thank you!

Timon: {singing} She actually smells unattractive.

He could wipe the floor after every meal.

Pune: I am happy even though I am skinny.

And it hurts that my friends never got off the air

And oh the shame

Timon: He was so embarrassed!

Pumbaa: I am changing my name.

Tim: Oh, what's in a name?

Bombay: And I'm heartbroken.

Timon: How are you feeling?

Bombay: Every time I.

Timmon: {talking} Pongba! In front of the children!

Pumbaa: {speaks} Oh... sorry.

{Pigeoncato string. Simba looks at the camera and is shocked.}

{As Simba watches intently, Timon lifts Pumbaa into a vine circle above his head, where he begins swinging.}

Pumbaa and Timon: Hakuna Matata!

Very good point

Hakuna Matata!

Crazy doesn’t pass.

Sabi: {After taking a deep breath, he finally learns to sing, and a light falls on him.) That means no worries.

Timmon: {I don't sing, does vaudeville knee-deep in Sinba} Yeah, sing, baby!

Sabi and Timon: Not our problem………

Pumbaa: {Landing beside them, in a gravelly voice} ………………… Wisdom….

All three: Hakuna Matata!

{Timon pulls a leaf from a plant, revealing a beautiful scene in the woods. The waterfalls and rugged landscapes make for stunning views. The harp is running around.}

Timon: Welcome to... our humble town.

Sabi: You're here?

Timon: We run wherever we want.

Pomba: Yes. Home is where your head rests. Hah!

Sebastian: Okay.

Pumpkin: {Loud raunchy belch} I'm so hungry.

Sabi: I'm so hungry that I could eat an entire egg.

{Timon is annoyed about Shimba wanting his meat-- a little annoyed and a little annoyed I knew this would happen.}

Timon: E-hey. We recovered from three.

Sabo: An antelope?

Tim: My ah.

Sabi: {a little disappointed} Hippo?

Tim: Nope. Listen, kid, if you’re going to live with us, you have to eat like us. Hey, this looks like a great place to hang out with some grub.

{Tim stopped in front of a tree. Pumbaa forces it down his nose, causing more insects to appear. Timon took one.}

Cymbal: Eve. What is that?

Tim: Gruber. It’s like what?

Cymbal: Eve. gross.

Tim: {filling kitchen door} Mmm. It tastes like chicken.

{Pumbaa pops a large wormhole from the ground. Both Timon and Pumba are celebrating with spoils now.}

Pumbaa: {Slu rping} Soft, but satisfying.

Timon: These are delicious, rare foods. {Grabs a smile} Mmm. {Crunches} Piquant, with a very nice crunch.

Pumbaa: You learn to love them.

Tim: I’m telling you, kid, this is the great life. There are no rules. There is no obligation. {Puts his finger inside a pillow-- more tobacco comes out} Oooh! Small, filled cream. {munch} And best of all, it’s worry-free.

{Timon collects dots on a leaf. He gives it to Saba. Sabi chose a grub.}

Tim: Okay, baby?

Sibo: Oh, that's right-- Hank Matata. {grabs it and swallows it}

{Moroccan patients}

Sabo: {sighs excitedly} It's weird, but it's satisfying.

Timon: That's it!

{Spots are flying off the leaf in brightly colored colours.}

{The scene shifts to all three of them crossing a tree, walking and throwing their heads in song. As the musical construction remains fixed, change occurs. We see a picture of young Simba as a young Simba, partially covered. And then Sabi becomes an adult. As the theme song plays, the camera pans a few feet away (6" off the ground) where the entire interaction was between Pom, Tim, and Sabi as a man, we first see Tim and then Bhumba , the camera continues from a low angle to where the baby Simba is, and we see the foot of the adult Simba. Scroll back up to see a bigger CB.}

Pumbaa and Timon: {Chanting to music} Hakuna matata hakuna matata hakuna matata.

Sabi: {adult voice now.} That means nothing to worry about.

throughout the rest of your day.

All three: Not our problem

philosophy

Sinba: Hakuna Matata.

{All three of them stumble down the tree to a well. First, Timon does the flying thing and makes a small squeak. Then Pumbaa, while swimming, also makes a small splash. Eventually, Sabi will climb up a tree (with his teeth in his hands). Before it dehydrates, the grapes will break under its own weight. The resulting water is large enough to wash the ponba and timothy ashore.}

{Simba joins the coasts of Timon and Pomba. The song plays in the classic Caribbean jazz version of "Hakuna Matata." We see the background view of Timon, Pumba, and Simba in the forest to the music of "Hakuna Matata".}

[Jasper sings]
{The camera pans to a distant shot at Pride Rock. All the colors are grey. Most of the trees and plants seem to be dead. We get to hear Zazoo’s first line and then the scene shifts to a scene of Zazoo and Scar. Zazu is in a cage made of animal skin and sings. The dragon crawled up the rock and cut its teeth on the bone.

Zazu: No one knows.

Here's the problem I'm

Nobody knows.

My heart...

Gillie: Oh Jazzu, lighten up. {throws a bone at Zazu and knocks him against the cage} and makes a chant with a little... jump into it.

Zazu: {Thinks for a moment} It's a small world after all...

Scarlet: {cut off, almost screaming} No! No, nothing at all!

Jasper: {thinks, then holds up a skull as a word comes to him.} I got a nice (diddly-dee-dee) cocoon head there, standing on top of each other.. {Scar is enjoying this and starts to come}.

Zazu and Scar: Big ones, small ones, some bigger than your head…

Jazzu: {While Scar continues} Oh... I would never do this for peace.

Joyce: {fast and angry} What? What did you say?

Jason: Oh, nothing!

Scarlett: You know the rule: Never, ever, ever tell on me. I... am... a king!

{Scar left his mouth in the middle of the room at the end of the hallway. His breath blows jazz into the wall.}

Jason: Yeah, man. You are the king. I... I... well, I said that to show how to run your kingdom. {evil laugh}

Banzai: {offscreen} Hey boss!

Scarlet: Oh, what is it this time?

Banzai: We got a bone to take to you.

Rain: {To Banzai} I'll handle this. {To Scar} Scar there's no food, no water...

Banzai: Yeah, it’s dinner time, and we don’t get a food smell.

Joyce: {angrily} It's the job of lionesses to hunt... {makes helpless gesture}

Banzai: Yeah, but they're not going to hunt.

Scarlet: Ohhh... Jasper.

Jasper: Oh, you're not going to like me! I’m going to chill and play and… eeww…

Scar: Oh, Jasper, don't be ridiculous. You just need a garbage can.

Banzai: {To Shenzi} I don't think things were going well with Mephasa.

Scarlet: {fast and angry again} What did you say?

Banzai: I said moff...

{Senji smiles at Scara and pushes Banzai to get his attention.}

Banzai: I said, uh... "What's going on?"

Jill: Okay. Now get out.

{The year starts but they stop}

Banzai: Mm... yeah, but - we're still hungry.

Scarlet: Get out!

{They run; Eddie lets out a mad laugh}

[Star Episode Two]
{The camera switches to a forest view. We hear a terrible scream echoing through the crowd. The camera then switches to Timon, Pumbaa, and Simba lying on their backs looking at the stars.}

Tim: Wow. It’s great, Sabi.

Cibby: Thank you. Man, I'm full.

Pomba: Me too. I ate like a pig.

Sabi: Pomboy - you're a pig.

Bombay: Ohhh. right.

{The three of them are very happy together. Good music disappears.}

Pumbaa: Timon?

Timon: Yeah?

Pumbaa: Ever wonder what those shiny spots are over there?

Timon: Pumbaa. I’m not pushing myself; I know.

Bombay: Ohhh. What are they?

Tim: They’re fire. The flames that... clung to this big... blue-black... thing.

Bombay: Ohhh. Gee. I always thought they were a bunch of gases burning billions of kilometers away.

Tim: Pomboy, you think everything's a gas.

Pompeo: Cibby, what do you think?

Sabi: Yeah, I don't know...

Pumbaa: Come on. Honey, honey, honey.. Okay, come on, Sabi, did we tell you to take ours... pleeeeease?

Tim: Come on, come on... honey, honey..

{Title "Leah Halal-Allah".}

Sabi: {reluctantly} Yes, someone once told me that there are archangels in heaven watching over us.

Pumbaa: {Awed, either in awe or in jest} Really?

Timon: You mean the dead kings were watching over us? {Tries to calm down then...} Pbbb.

{Timon lets out a laugh. Pumbaa added. Simba half-heartedly complied.}

Timon: Who told you about this? What mock made it?

Sabi: Yeah. Pretty understanding, huh?

Tim: Aw, you're killing me, Sabi.

{The music picks up again. Simba turned back to look up at the stars. It easily lifts away.}

Tim: Did I say something?

[Recording Channel]
{The music continues. Sabi appears on one platform and watches the others. Then he falls to the edge of the platform. Milk water is agitated in the air by its fibers. The camera is on its way. It crosses the desert. Then we see Refik's hand pulling some out of the air. He sighs, whimpers, and flies back into his tree. He pours the milk into a circle, surrounds it, and eats the fruit he has picked from the Saba. Looking at the milkshake, sometimes understanding leaps out of his face.}

Rafik: Shibo? He's- he's alive? Hey hey- he's alive! {laughs}

{Rafiq holds her hand. Laughing merrily, he picks up a paintbrush and places a skull at the lion’s portrait on the wall.}

Rafik : It's time!

["In the Jungle" scene]
{The camera switches to a forest scene. We hear Pumba sing "The Donkey Sleeps Tonight". Timon added as they walked towards the camera. Capella.}

Punjab: {singing} Ohimbib

Ohhinbub

{and.....}

Timon: {Singing} In The Woods

large forest

The lion will sleep tonight.

In the wild

large forest

{Pumbaa turns to follow a barrier; It disappears.}

Timon: {singing} The lion is sleeping... {speaking} I can't hear you, buddy, turn away from me!

{Pumbaa has faded out, and begins his barbaric walk. This site is detailed and elegant.}

Timon: A-wee-ee-e-e-e-e-e-a-pom-ba-boom-ba-yeah

{realizing that Pumba isn't there}

Tim: A-pombo? Pombo?

{Change camera to pumba after mistake. He’s still talking bass. He follows Basket to a tree and hides behind it. When he tries to jump off the tree, he freezes for a moment and then looks back.}

Pongboy: {Spooky} Timon? {looks around, then raises his hand}

{He jumps up the tree. When looking at the point up close, the camera (in its field of view) shifts focus to two green eyes in the grass. The camera closes on a female tiger (adult Nala) preparing to pounce.

Poonboy: Yeeeeeahhh!

{He runs off, with the elephant in a bad way. Nala, with his teeth and nails, is chasing Pumba with great speed. The camera switches to Timmon.}

Timmon: {hearing searching sounds} Bombay?

{Pumba runs alongside Timon and gets under a tree root trying to grab it.}

Timmon: Pombo! Punjab! Hey, what's going on?

Pumbaa: It's going to eat me!

Timon: Huh?

{Timon got up from the tree branch and saw Nala charging as fast as he could towards them. He got down and tried to help pull Pumba out from under the root.}

Tim: {seeing the snowman} Wow! … Jessie! Why do I always need you to AAAAAA!

{On the AAAAAA!, Tim saw Nala was getting locked up on Punjab and was on the show. At the last minute, Simba jumped up and grabbed Nala’s head with all his might. They start fighting in earnest.}

Timon: {To Pumbaa} Don't worry, buddy. I’m here for you. Everything will be fine. {To Simba} Go! Send his head off! Go to the drain. First! {to Pumbaa} Look, I told you it was going to be in my hands.

{The pictures are a little blurry. The war becomes competitive. Nala turned Simba and slapped him with a loud noise. Simba is shocked at this. Nalla is still baring his teeth. Sabi, however, will be so surprised that he will no longer be afraid.}

Sinba: Nala?

{She immediately turns around and looks at Simba and tries.}

Sabo: Are you the real one?

Nala: Who are you?

Sabi: I am. Sinba.

Nala: Sinba? {Pause for realization} Wow!

{Sabha and Nala run together and greet each other. The greetings are cheerful and welcoming.}

Nala: Well, how are you.. Where are you from... Nice to meet you... (continue)

Sabo: Ah! How did you do that... Who... Wow... that's amazing... great to see you...

{Timon's look at the camera who's impressed by this sudden change}

Timon: Hey, what's going on here?

Sabi: {Still to Nala} What are you doing here?

Nala: What do you mean, what am I doing here? What are you doing here?

Tim: Hey! What is going on here!?!?!

Sinba: Timon, this is Nala. She’s my best friend!

Tim: {very confused} Dude?!?

Sabi: Yeah. Hey Pumbaa, come here.

{Pumbaa frees himself.}

Sinba: Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.

Pumbaa: It’s great to do your music.

Nala: All flavors are mine.

Tim: How do you do that... Whoa! Wow. Time is up. Lemme get this straight. You know. He knows you. But he wants to eat it. And everyone... okay with this? Did I miss something?!?

Sabi: Relax, Timon.

Nalla: Just wait until everyone knows you've been here this time! And your mother… what does she think?

Sabi: {Understanding} Not necessarily. No one has to know.

Nala: Yes, of course they do. Everyone thinks you’re dead.

Sabi: They do?

Nala: Yes. Scar told us about the process.

Sabi: Did he? Well... {Starts to look at something} What else did he tell you?

Nala: What else is important? You’re alive. And that means… you’re a king.

Timmons: King? PBB. Miss, have you cut your glasses?

Pongboy: The king? Your Majesty! I’m coming at your feet. {Noisily kisses Sabi's feet}

Sabi: Stop it.

Timmon: {To Pumbaa} That's not a "grope." That's "growl". And DON'T-- he's not a king. {to Simba} Are you?

Cibby: No.

Nala: Sinba?

Sabi: No, I'm not a king. Maybe I would have left, but… it was too late.

Tim: Let me explain this. Are you the king? And you never told us?

Sabi: Look, I'm still the same guy.

Timon: {Goodness} But with power!

Nala: {Apologetic} Can you excuse us for a few minutes?

Watt: Hey {taps Pumbaa} He can say whatever he wants to our faces. No, Sibi?

Sabo: Hmm. Maybe it’s yours.

Timmons: {Agastes, then dropping his work} It begins. You think you know a guy…

{Pumba and Timon pad of. Pongba will be happy.}

Simba: Timon and Pumbaa. You learn to love 'em.

{Nala bows her head with a sigh.}

Sabi: What? ...what is that?

Nala: {Inside} Looks like you came back from the dead. You don’t know what effect this will have on everyone. {pained expression} …what it means to me.

Sabi: Hey, no problem.

Nala: {tucks her hair under her chin, squeezes it} I miss you so much.

Sabi: {I was at Nala's violence for a moment, then she confronts me} I thought of you too.

["You Can Feel Love Tonight" Scene]
{They shake their heads. We hear Tim groan; Switch the camera to show them looking into the dog.}

Timon: {Heavy sigh} I'll tell you about the bombshell and the box.

Bombay: Ohhh. Sorry.

Timon: You're not. they! she. her. alone.

Bombay: What's wrong?

Timmons: {singing. The parents part is voiced by Pongbo.} I can see what's going on

(what?)

And they have no idea

(who?)

They are in love and this is just the beginning.

The three of us are reduced to two.

(Oh.)

{French laughing} Sweet touch in the afternoon.

{Back to trend, but funny} Magic is everywhere.

And with all that lovely atmosphere

There's a smell in the air.

{The area passes through Timon and Pomba to Siba and Nala in front of a waterfall.}

Sally Dworski: Do you feel love tonight?

Does the night bring peace?

The world, for once, in perfect harmony

And all his life.

{After circling each other, picking up each other’s movements, they stop for a drink of water.}

Sabi: {thinking} Lots to tell him

But how does it look

The truth about my past? impossible!

He was facing me.

Nala: {thinking} He's holding it, he's hiding it.

But what? I can't decide.

Why not be a king when I know he is?

What angel do I see inside?

{During the chorus this happens: Sabha looks at Nala, smiles and runs out of the stage. She runs back to the farm, scoops a grape into her mouth, and pours water into the middle of the bucket. Nala looks at the still water. Suddenly Simba pulled her into the pool to play. From there, everywhere he goes and gets shot. When Sabo leaves, he pushes her further in. The place turns into a fight for them. They end up fighting. After falling off the cliff, Simba ends up surrounding Nala first. She gives him a small nod that looks like a kiss. Sinba sat down and looked at Nala. Approaching Nala, looking behind him with a determined smile. Sabi's expression whose expression changes from the action to the perceived.. Two touched heads (cat style) as the last word is in the song.}

Chloe: Can you feel love tonight?

Does the night bring peace?

The world, for once, in perfect harmony

And the rest of his life?

Are you making love tonight?

You don’t have to look far -

Steal in the Uncertain Nights.

Love is where they are.

{Camera pans to Timon and Pumbaa in tears.}

Timon: And if she's in love tonight.

{The pumpkin sucks}

You might think -

{Timon kisses Pumbaa, crying.}

Pumbaa: His dangerous days with us are history –

Timon and Pumbaa: In short, our friend is doomed.

{They burst into tears.}

[The ghost scene of Moses]
Sabi: Isn't this a beautiful place?

Nala: Okay. But I don't understand a thing. You are alive in all these moments. Why didn’t you go back to Pride Rock?

Simba: {Climbing in a "hammock" of hanging vines} Yeah, I just needed to... get out on my own. Living my own life. And I did. And it’s beautiful. {It sounds like she’s trying to convince herself, like Nala.}

Nala: {picking up voice, as if uncontrollable} We need you home.

Sabi: {Quiter} Nobody needs me.

Nala: Yes, we do! You are a king.

Sabi: Come on, we've been through this. I’m not a king. Blood is.

Nala: Simba, he left the prayers and took over the pride lands.

Sabi: What?

Nala: Everything is ruined. There is no food. There is no water. Sabi, if you don’t do something soon, everyone will starve.

Sabi: I can't go back.

Nala: {confidently} Why?

CB: You don’t understand.

Nala: What do I not understand?

Cibby: {quickly} No, no, no. There’s nothing wrong with it. Hakuna Matata.

Nala: {confused} What?

Sinba: Hakuna Matata. I read something here. Look again, bad things happen…

Nala: Sinba!

Sabi: (continues, looking angry) ...and there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry?

{Sub starts to get out of the bowl and walk over a fallen tree. God returned to him.}

Nala: Because that’s your job!

Shiba: Well, how did you say? You’re out.

Nala: I went out to get help! And I found you. Don't you understand? You are our hope.

Sabi: I'm sorry.

Nala: What happened to you? You’re not the Sabine I remember.

Sabi: You're right. I'm not. Now, are you satisfied?

Nalla: No, I’m just disappointed.

Sebastian: You know, you're starting to sound like my dad. {walk again}

Nala: Okay. At least one of us does.

{The cut of Siba is evident from his father's words ; He interrupts Nala with her words.}

Simba: {Angry} Listen, you think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life? You have no idea what I’ve been through!

Nala: I’ll tell you if you’ll just tell me!

Sabi: Forget it!

Nala: Okay!

{Siba walks away. Change the camera to Simba's walk through the farm.}

Sabi: It's wrong. I can't go back. What does that mean anyway? It doesn’t change anything. You can’t change the past. {She looks up at the others.} You said you'd always see me! But you're not. And that’s because of me. It's my fault. It's my fault.

{She bows her head and chokes back tears. The camera moves back to the distance and then zooms in on Rafiki’s nearby tree. We hear his song.}

No Asante!

Banana Seeds!

Let's sigh!

Mi mi apan!

{Seems Sabi is angry with the song. It’s far away. Rafiq, also known as Sabha, follows him. Simba was lying on a tree above a pond. The rock disturbs the water, and Rafik, now near a tree, resumes his song.}

Sabi: Come on, will you cut it? {Rafik laughs as he plays in the trees nearby.}

Rafik: I can’t cut it. It will grow immediately! {laughs}

{Siba started to walk away. Rafik follows.}

Sabo: Scary little snake. Will you cover my back? who are you?

Rafik: {In front of Sibu, then in front of him.} The question is: Who... are you?

Sabi: {I was shocked and then I was like, I know. Now I’m not so sure.

Rafik: Yeah, I know who you are. LS. come here. That's the secret.

No Asante!

Banana Seeds!

Let's sigh!

Mi mi apan!

Sabo: It's already enough. What does that mean anyway?

Rafik: That means you're a grandmother - I'm not. {laughs}

Sabi: {continuing} I guess... You're a little confused.

Rafik: {speaking in front of Sabath Sabi} Bad. I’m not one to mess around; You don’t even know who you are.

Sabi: {angrily, sarcastic} Oh, and I think you know?

Rafcook: Right; You are the son of Mephibosheth. ...bye!

{Siba is surprised at this gesture. Rafiki disappears from the stage right.}

{Cue Music: The "La" word.}

Sabi: Hey, stop it!

{Siba is behind him. When we are caught up. Rafik occupies a lotus position on a rock.}

Sabi: You knew my father?

Rafik: {Monotone} Correct-- I know your father.

Sabi: I hate to tell you this, but... she died. It doesn't last long.

{Rafiq jumps off a rock into what looks like a cave.}

Rafik: No. Thrown again! Ha ha ha! He's alive! And I’ll show you. Find Old Rafiki, he knows the way, take him from there!

{Rafik leads Sabha to the brush. Simba has trouble keeping up because of his size. The song goes into African music.}

Rafiq: Don't tease. hurry up!

Cymbi: Hey, wow. Wait, wait.

Rafik: Come on, come on.

Sabi: Are you slow?

{Rafik suddenly jumps up and jumps in front of Sabi, laughing and crying. Sabi struggles to keep up. Suddenly, Rafiki appears and raises his hand in Sinba’s face.}

Rafik: Wait!

{Rafik turns to Saba near some bushes.}

{She splits weeds and aims at them with her cane.}

Rafik: You're..down...there. {Sub makes his way out slowly and carefully. He is in the corner of the eye and sees his reflection in the water. He seems a bit shocked, maybe it’s the mature version of himself, but then he realizes what he’s looking at.}

Sabi: {angrily} That's not my father. That’s just my opinion.

Rafik: No, try...it's hard.

{Rafiq moves on the pool. The pipes are installed, disrupting the Sinba design, and are aimed at the quiet front. A strange noise is heard.}

Rafik : You see, it's inside you.

{Siba is afraid. The wind picks up. In the air, a large figure of Mephisto emerged from the clouds. It looks like he’s walking out of stairs. The image looks the same as it did at first, but it's colored and balanced.}

Mephisto's Mind: {sighs at first} Sabi . . .

Sibo: Father?

Mephisto's Mind: Sabi, you forgot me.

Cibby: No. How can I?

Mephasa's Wisdom: You've forgotten who you are, thus forgetting me. Look inside yourself Sabi. You are greater than who you have become. You have to play your part in the circle of life.

Sabi: How can I go back? I’m not a person yet.

Mephasa Wisdom: Remember who you are. You are my son, and a true king.

{Shiba's open face, bathed in golden light, shows fear, terror, and confusion of sorrow. Mephasa's image begins to fade.}

Mephasa Wisdom: Remember who you are.

{Murph's mind is quickly disappearing into the clouds. Sabi runs into the well trying to take a picture.}

Shabby: No, please! Don’t leave me.

Mephasa Mind: Remember...

Cibby: Dad!

Mephasa Mind: Remember...

Sabi: Don't leave me.

Mephasa Mind: Remember...

{Sub remains in the field. Only a cloud remained where his father's picture had been. The wind blows the grass carelessly. Rafik gets closer.}

Rafik: What was that? {laughs} Day time-- pubb! Very special. Don't you think so?

Sabi: Yeah. It feels like the wind is shifting.

Rafik: Ahhh. Change is good.

Sabi: Yeah, but it's not easy. I know what I have to do. But, going back meant I had to deal with my past. I've been running with it for a long time.

{Rafik hits Sabha on the head with his bag.}

Sabo: Oh! Geez-- what was that for?

Rafik: It’s nothing; It’s in the past! {laughs}

Sabi: {touches head} Yes, but it hurts.

Rafik: Oh yes, the past can be painful. But I can see how you can run from it or… learn from it.

{He turns to the Sabine and his staff again. This time breast ducks.}

Rafik: Heh, you see! So what are you going to do?

Sabi: First, I'll take your stick.

{Cymbia nearly throws away Rafik's hand.}

Rafiki: No no no no! Not a wand!

{As Rafik gets his staff, Sabu starts running.}

Rafik: Hey, where are you going?

Sabi: {shouting back} I'm coming back!

Rafik: Okay! Go! Get out of here! {Laughter, Hoot, n' Dutch. As he holds his wand above his head, there are a few bright stars in the sky. Music rises to the "Busa" theme of the party:}

[Featured by Tim and Nala]
{Camera switches to a sleeping Timon and Pumbaa. Timon is curled up on Pumbaa, Pumbaa lying on his back. They both stick. In his swim, Pompey repeatedly utters "Grubs, grubs." Nala walked over and touched Timon on the foot.}

Nela: Hey. Hey, wake up.

{Timon woke up and saw the face of a great lion. She starts crying and Bombay joins in.}

Nala: Okay. Wow, wow. good. It's me.

Timon: Don’t do that again! Meat eaters, oh!

Nala: Have you seen Saba?

Wymon: {holding hand to his head} I think he's with you.

Nala: It was, but now I don't get it. Where is it?

{We hear Rafiq laughing; sitting in a tree above them.}

Rafik: Ho ho ho ho. You won’t find it here. Ha ha. The King… is back.

Ella: {bird} I can't believe that. { louder, amazed} He’s back.

Tim: You're back? what do you mean? {She looks at where the ref was; Rafik leaves now} Hey! What's going on here? Who is Monkey?

Nala: Sinba went to confront Scar.

Tim: Who?

Nala: Jelly.

Bombay: Who's with whom?

Nala: {shaking her head} No, no, no. His grandfather.

Timmon: Monkey is his grandfather?

Nala: No! Sinba has returned to find his grandfather and take his place as king.

Timon and Pumbaa: Ohhh.

[Escape Zone]
{Along with the accompanying music (repeat "Busa" theme), we see a long shot of Siba running full speed through the desert. Sabi's feet kick the sand.}

[Leary Seat]
{Saba slowly crosses the countryside. He reaches the edge of a mountain and sees his old home. Mostly lifeless, painting in the dust. This is destruction, reality, even pain in Saba's face.}

Nalla: Sinba, wait! {She flies onto the platform next to him} ...It's pretty cool, isn't it?

Sabi: I didn't want to believe you.

Nala: What motivated you?

Sabo: I finally got an inner feeling. And I got Papa to prove it. After all, this is my kingdom. If I don’t fight for her, who will?

Nala: I will.

Sabi: It’s going to be dangerous.

Nala: {speaking to Sabi's wife} Danger? Ha! I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha ha.

Tim: I don't find anything funny about this.

Sabo: Timmon? Pombo? What are you doing here?

Pumbaa: {kneeling forward on one foot} On your service, my lieutenant.

Tim: Ahhh. We'll hate your father... for this?

Sabi: Yeah, Tim; This is my house.

Tim: Yeah. Talk to your second-upper. Well, Sabi, if it’s important to you, {bows} we’re with you until the end.

{Sabi smiles gratefully. Great view with all four of them in line watching the action in front of them.}

[Hulla Episode]
{The camera switches to Saba. Nala, Timon, and Pumba moved to the side of Pride Rock. From behind the tree, they watched groups of giraffes.

Timmon: Mercies. I hate death. {To Simba, whispering} So what's your plan to get past these guys?

Sabo: A living egg.

Tim: Great idea. {understanding} Hey!

Sabi: Come on, Timon-- you need to plan a show.

Watt: {Incredulous} What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do hula?

{Camera switches to Timon in a hula suit. The song on the soundtrack is a Hawaiian battle song, like a Spike Jones version. Pumba is traditionally served as a roast pig, albeit with apples in the mouth. Jungle Drum Riff.}

Timmon: Luo!

If you’re hungry for some fatty and juicy meat.

Eat Pongboy here my friend because it's the best thing ever!

Eat the demon

About this sweet pig.

All you have to do is get on the site

{The bow scenes are from Pumbaa song, with apples at his feet.}

Aaarr you're achi'

(Yes, yes, yes)

Do you have any baked goods?

(Yes, yes, yes)

Hey, it's a big pig.

(Yes, yes)

You can be a big pig too.

Yes!

{They run screaming to let some rats go. Simba and Nala did.}

Sabi: Come on, you'll find my mother and save the village women. {determinedly} I'm looking for Karen.

[Team Location]
{Simba makes his way over Pride Rock. Scar called out to his mother, regaining his voice}

Joel: Sarabi!!

{Sharab climbing Pride Rock. Salvador screams and leaps to his feet. She just smiles at them with a smile.}

Saraby: Yes, Scar?

Scarlet: Where's your comedy team? They’re not doing their job.

Sarab: {Calmly} Scrooge, there's no food. The animals left and moved on.

Scarlet: No, you don't have to look too far.

Sarabi: Out of Scarab. There’s nothing there. We only have one choice. We need to get out of Pride Rock.

Scarlet: We're not going anywhere.

Sarabi: So you've sentenced us to death.

Scar: Then so be it.

Sarab: {confused} You can't do that.

Scarlet: I'm the king. I can do anything I want.

Sarab: If you were a half-king, Mephasas would never -

{Joy hits a lightning bolt and hits the ground.}

Scarlet: I'm ten times King Mephisto's son!

{Shiba comes off the ledge screaming louder. She jumps out and runs to her mother. Scar mistakes Sabi as Mephasa and is understandably scared.}

Scar: Mephis? No, you’re dead.

{Sharab woke up at the sound of his son's touch, but was mistaken for him as Mephasa, as Scar did.}

Sarabi: Mephasa?

Sabi: No, I am.

Sarab: {my sigh} Sib? Are you alive? {confusion} How is that possible?

Sabi: It’s nothing; I'm home.

Joel: {confused} Sabi...? {back to main} Sinba! I’m a little surprised to see you, {looking sadly at the prayers above him} alive…

{On the subject of "life," Senji, Banzai, and Eddie sigh and sigh in the shadows.}

Sabi: {As Sarabi proudly looks at him} Give me a good reason why I shouldn't join you.

Scarlet: (from the back wall, apologizing) Oh, Sabi, you have to understand. Royal Rule Restrictions...

Sabi: ...they're not yours anymore. Remember, Jolly.

Scarlet: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh huh I would, but there's one small problem. See them? {points to the horde of hyenas on the rocks above} They think I'm a king.

{Nal leaves with the other lionesses.}

Nala: Yeah, we don't know. Sabi is a true king.

Sabi: The choice is yours, Scrooge. Either get down or fight.

Scarlet: Oh, it all has to end in violence, doesn't it? I don’t want to be responsible for the death of a family member. Wouldn’t you agree with Sabi?

Sabi: That won't work, Scarlett. I left him behind me.

Scar: Eh, but what about your loved ones? Did they leave him behind?

Nala: Sabi, what is he talking about?

Sirius: {Delighted} Ahh, so don't tell them your little secret. Well, Sabi, now is your chance to tell them. Tell them who is involved in Mephasa’s death!

{The last of Scarlet's lines allows the Lionesses to start. Everyone focuses on Saba.}

Sabi: {turns around, then takes a step forward} It's me.

{Sarabi approaches his son.}

Sarab: {with a lot of heart} That's not true. Tell me it's not true.

Sabi: {excitedly} That's true.

Scarlet: Look! She accepts it! Murderer!

{The light falls on the back of Scarlett's head for focus.}

Sabi: No, it was an accident.

{Scar walks and circles Ciba as if to accuse him; Live rotation very well done.}

Scarlet: If you weren't there, Mephisto would be alive. It was your fault he died; Do you deny that?

Cibby: No.

Joyce: {Seriously} So... you're... guilty.

Sabi: No, I'm not a murderer.

Scar: Oh, Sabi, you're always in trouble. But this time, Father is not here to save you. And now everyone.. knows... why!

{Scar helped Simba to the height of Pride Rock. After his last sentence, Sabi turns to the door and clings to the door with his front legs. The light falls down and lights the fire.}

Nala: Sinba!

{Scar sits behind her and pretends to think.}

Scarlet: Now that sounds familiar. Hmm. Where have I seen this? I'm thinking. Hmm... Hmm. Oh yeah, I remember that. This is what your father looked like before he died.

{Scar grabs Simba by the horns just as he grabbed Mufasa. he whispers in Sabi's ear.}

Scarlet: And here's my little secret: I...killed...Mufasa!

{Shiba has a quick memory for that specific time. His voice is mixed with the voice of a child when his father died. In a huge leap, he jumped and pushed Scarlet behind him. Jay is completely taken by surprise, anxious and shaking.}

Simba: No! ...Killer!

Scarlet: No, Sabi, please.

Sabi: Tell them the truth.

Joel: Really? But the truth is in plain sight - llgkkk!

{Sub starts to hit Scar.}

Scar: Okay. all right. (especially toxic) I did.

Sabi: So they can hear you.

Scarlet: {Grudgingly but sincerely} I killed Mephasa!

{Nala starts towards Scar, and the wolves attack Sabi through a wall of teeth. The female buffaloes join him and we see Pumba and Timon entering, Pumba submitting to Timon. Mice flying everywhere.}

Timon and Pumbaa: Hey-yaaah!

Tim: 'I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Commin' to pass. Hot stuff. Wow!

{Sound effects of bowling strikes as prayers fly. Rafiq hits three on Simba. The camera shifts to him; With a battle cry he comes into battle. As a relaxed comic, Rafiki fights in a King-Fu "B-movie" style, complete with sound effects.}

Rafik: {As he punches various rats} WwwA! Hosanna ! Hassos! Oh! Yes߹ Heeoow!

{Camera switches to Timon running away from Cenji. He ran into the cave. Zazu saw him. Timon runs into his cage to protect himself from the monkeys.}

Zazu: Let me go! Let me go!

Timon: Let me in! Let me in! {To the elders, praying} ...Pen-heese, don't eat it.

{The Pumbaa leaves the edge of the cave.}

Pumbaa: Let it go!

Banzai: Hey, who's Leo?

Pumbaa: Are you talking to me?

Tim: Oh, oh, oh. They called him Leo.

Pumbaa: Are you talking to me?!

Timon: Shouldn't he?

Pumbaa: Are you kidding me?!?

Timon: Now they’re into it.

Pumbaa: They call me... MS. Aaaahhh...

{The Pumbaa charges and chases the flies away.}

Tim: Take that! And that!

Banshee: Oh oh oh oh oh oh ...

Bombay: Take that! And that! Your yellow belly…

Zazu: Take this you idiot…

The end of the battle.
{They start singing Ernest Hall's "Ooh, ooh." The scene changes to Simba chasing Scar all the way to the top of Pride Rock. Joel runs to the door and sees a fall. The symbiote flies to meet him at the edge of what looks like a cave. Scar is terrified, as he's in the cage and at Simba's mercy.}

Sabi: {Gentle, brutal} Killer.

Jelly: Simba, Simba. please. I feel sorry for you. I’m calling you.

Sabi: You don’t have to live.

Scarlet: But Sabi, I'm... ah... {not sure of his method} Baby. It is the rats {regain composure} that are the real enemy. It was their fault - it was their idea!

{Sanji, Banzai, and Ed are in the back. They hear him and return screaming for Scar’s betrayal.

Sabi: Why should I trust you? Everything you told me was a lie.

Scarlet: What are you going to do? You wouldn't kill your own Bonner...? {Sweet smile}

Sabi: No, Scarlett. I'm not like that.

Scarlet: {very relaxed} Oh, Sabi, thank you. You are truly wonderful people. I’ll fix it for you, I promise. How can I introduce myself to you? tell me; I mean, whatever.

Sabo: {growls, with genuine anger} Run. Run, Scar. And don’t ever go back.

Scarlett: Yeah. of course. As you wish... {Looks down and sees some hot coals} ...Your Majesty! {Scarlet throws coal in Sabi's face. With a sudden cry of anger, Sinba pushes the rocks away from them as Shikaar leaps up to attack.}

{The battle will be slow. Both Scar and Simba suffer severe beatings. Sabi knocks on his back. Blood flies into the fire for him. Simba gathered the courage to use Scar's strength in a "throw", Nala's similar fighting techniques to send him aside. Blood falls to the floor. He wakes up weakly. He sees Banzai, Senji, and Ed approaching them and smiles. Ed has a furious look on his face.}

Scarlet: Ah, my friends.

Rain: (laughs) Friends? I thought he said we were the worst!

Banzai: Yeah, that's what I heard.

Banzai and Senji: Ed?

Eddie: {laughs hysterically}

Joyce: {Very nervous} No. (Speaking) I'll explain. No, you misunderstood. No! I didn't mean to... No, no! Look, I'm sorry I called you... No! No!

{The camera moves away and we can see only the shadows as the monkeys close in and eat the jelly. The rain opens and puts out the fire. Simba gets down and greets his mother and Nala. Rafiki proposes to Simba to ascend Pride Rock as King. Simba started and stopped to kiss Rafiki like his father did.

Rafik: It's time.

last
Wandering in the rain. Music is powerful. We can see some through a hole in the clouds. One bright star shines very slowly.

Mephas: Pay attention.

{The speech of Siba gains confidence and authority. The weather changes to savannah in bloom all over again. The word "push" :}

There’s a whole bunch of animals and they make a noise like Sinba on the show.}
