1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,720
#Oh, I come from a land
From a faraway place#

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,080
#Where the caravan camels roam#

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,640
#Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense#

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,120
#It's barbaric but hey, it's home#

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,680
#When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west#

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,840
#And the sand in the glass is right#

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,880
#Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly#

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,280
#To another Arabian night#

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,880
#Arabian nights#

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,520
#Like Arabian days#

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,160
#More often than not
Are hotter than hot#

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,680
#In a lot of good ways#

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,080
#Arabian nights#

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,600
#'Neath Arabian moons#

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,600
#A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard#

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,160
#Out there on the dunes#

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,320
Ah, salaam, and good evening
to you, worthy friend.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
Please, please, come closer.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,080
T oo close. A little too close.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
There.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,040
Welcome to Agrabah,

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,480
city of mystery,

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,160
of enchantment,

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,960
and the finest merchandise this side
of the river Jordan, on sale today.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Look at this. Yes.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,960
Will not break. Will not...

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
It broke.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,080
Ohh! Look at this.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,800
I have never seen
one of these intact before.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,440
Listen. Ah, still good.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
Wait. Don't go.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,560
I can see that you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,640
I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,800
Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,960
but what is inside that counts.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
This is no ordinary lamp.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,560
It once changed the course
of a young man's life.

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,640
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,040
The diamond in the rough.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,280
Perhaps you would
like to hear the tale?

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,960
It begins on a dark night...

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,120
where a dark man waits

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,400
with a dark purpose.

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,280
You are late.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,160
A thousand apologies, O Patient One.

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
You have it then?

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,840
I had to slit a few throats,
but I got it.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,880
Ah-ah-ahhh.

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
The treasure.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,600
Ow!

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,440
Trust me, my pungent friend.

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,560
- You'll get what's coming to you.
- What's coming to you. Awk!

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,480
Quickly! Follow the trail.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,640
Faster.

58
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,600
At last, after all
my years of searching...

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,280
the Cave of Wonders.

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,520
Awk. Cave of Wonders.

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,080
By Allah.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,080
Now, remember.
Bring me the lamp.

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,880
The rest of the treasure
is yours, but the lamp is mine.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,280
Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp.

65
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Jeez, where'd ya dig
this bozo up?

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,120
Shh.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,160
Who disturbs my slumber?

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,640
It is l, Gazeem,

69
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,640
a humble thief.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,360
Know this.

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,920
Only one may enter here,

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,560
one whose worth lies far within.

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,560
A diamond in the rough.

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,680
What are you waiting for#Go on.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
No!

76
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,960
Seek thee out
the diamond in the rough.

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,520
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,640
We're never gonna get
a hold of that stupid lamp.

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,200
Just forget it.
Look at this.

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,400
Patience, lago. Patience.

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,080
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,080
Oh, there's a big surprise.

84
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,600
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,160
What are we gonna do?
We got a big problem here, a big...

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Yes.

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,240
Only one may enter.

88
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
I must find this one, this...

89
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
diamond in the rough.

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,400
Stop! Thief!

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Stop! Thief!

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,600
I'll have your hands
for a trophy, street rat.

93
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,280
All this for a loaf of bread?

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,920
Whoa!

95
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,760
- There he is!
- You won't get away so easy!

96
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,800
You think that was easy?

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,800
You two, over that way,
and you, follow me.

98
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,120
- We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.

99
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,880
Getting into trouble a little early
today, aren't we, Aladdin?

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
Trouble. No way. You're only
in trouble if you get caught.

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,680
- Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.

102
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,120
And this time...

103
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,840
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,440
- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get outta here.

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,080
#Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line#

106
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,160
#One swing ahead of the sword#

107
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,720
#I steal only what I can't afford#

108
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,880
That's everything.

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,600
#One jump ahead of the lawmen#

110
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
#That's all and that's no joke#

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,640
#These guys don't appreciate I'm broke#

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,880
- Riffraff.
- Street rat.

113
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,840
- Scoundrel.
- Take that.

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,720
#Just a little snack, guys#

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,480
#Rip him open
Take it back, guys#

116
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,440
#I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts#

117
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,560
- #You're my only friend, Abu#
- Who?

118
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,080
#Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom#

119
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,680
#He's become a one-man rise in crime#

120
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,560
#I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em#

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,320
#Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat#

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,760
#Tell you all about it
When I got the time#

123
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,400
#One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom#

124
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,720
#Next time gonna use a nom de plume#

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,760
There he is.

126
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,640
#One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock#

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,320
#I think I'll take a stroll
Around the block#

128
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,240
- Stop, thief.
- Vandal.

129
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,840
- Abu!
- Scandal.

130
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,960
#Let's not be too hasty#

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,840
#Still I think he's rather tasty#

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
#Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat#

133
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
#Otherwise we'd get along#

134
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,520
Wrong.

135
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
Get him!

136
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
He's got a sword!

137
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,600
You idiots.
We've all got swords.

138
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,760
- #One jump ahead of the hoofbeats#
- Vandal!

139
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,600
- #One hop ahead of the hump#
- Street rat!

140
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,520
- #One trick ahead of disaster#
- Scoundrel!

141
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
#They're quick, but I'm much faster#

142
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,840
#Here goes, better throw my hand in#

143
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,200
#Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump#

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,960
Yuck! Oy!

145
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.

146
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,200
All right.

147
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,600
Yum, yum!

148
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,400
Uh-oh.

149
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,760
Here. Go on. Take it.

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,040
Ah, don't. Huh?

151
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

152
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Another suitor for the princess.

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,560
- Out of my way, you filthy brats.

154
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,040
Hey!

155
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,680
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

156
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,600
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.

157
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,840
Look at that, Abu.

158
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

159
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
Ooh!

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,480
You are a worthless street rat.

161
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,720
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,

162
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
and only your fleas will mourn you.

163
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,680
I'm not worthless.

164
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,880
And I don't have fleas.

165
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,320
Come on, Abu.
Let's go home.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,120
#Riffraff, street rat#

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,440
#I don't buy that#

168
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,120
#If only they'd look closer#

169
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,200
#Would they see a poor boy#

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,920
#No, siree#

171
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,240
#They'd find out#

172
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,920
#There's so much more#

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,000
#To me#

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,880
Some day, Abu,
things are gonna change.

175
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,800
We'll be rich, live in a palace,

176
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,000
and never have any problems at all.

177
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
I've never been so insulted.

178
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,920
Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,040
Good luck marrying her off.

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,600
Oh! Jasmine.

181
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,800
Jasmine!

182
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,720
Jasmine!

183
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,720
- Jasmine!

184
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,840
Confound it, Rajah.

185
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
So, this is why Prince Achmed
stormed out.

186
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,520
Oh, Father.

187
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,320
Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?

188
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,520
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

189
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,240
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?

190
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,360
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

191
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,120
The law says
you must be married to a prince...

192
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,080
by your next birthday.

193
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
The law is wrong.

194
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,800
You've only got three more days.

195
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,360
Father, I hate being forced into this.

196
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,600
If I do marry,
I want it to be for love.

197
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,760
Jasmine...

198
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,880
it's not only this law.

199
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm not going to be around forever,
and, well, l...

200
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,880
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

201
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,280
Provided for.

202
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,960
Please try to understand.

203
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,080
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

204
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,800
Except you, Rajah.

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,200
I've never even been
outside the palace walls.

206
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,640
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

207
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,520
Then maybe I don't want
to be a princess anymore.

208
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
Oooh! I... I...

209
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,360
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

210
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
Hmm?

211
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,360
I don't know where she gets it from.

212
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,280
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

213
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,760
Oh! Ah, Jafar.

214
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,240
My most trusted advisor.

215
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

216
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

217
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,440
It's this suitor business.

218
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,920
Jasmine refuses
to choose a husband.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,880
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!

220
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Oh!

221
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,160
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

222
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,400
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

223
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,960
Now, then,
perhaps I can divine a solution

224
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,080
to this thorny problem.

225
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
If anyone can help, it's you.

226
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,680
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

227
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,520
Oh. Uh, my ring?

228
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,880
But it's been in the family for years.

229
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.

230
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't worry.

231
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,440
Everything will be fine.

232
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,960
Everything will be... fine.

233
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
The diamond.

234
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,520
Here, Jafar.

235
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,920
Whatever you need will be fine.

236
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,600
You are most gracious, my liege.

237
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,160
Now, run along and play
with your little toys, hmm?

238
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,640
Yes. That will be pretty good.

239
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
I can't take it anymore!

240
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,600
If I gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

241
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Bam! Whack!

242
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,200
Calm yourself, lago.

243
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,480
Then I'd grab him around the head.
Whack!

244
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,240
Soon I will be sultan,
not that addle-pated twit.

245
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,480
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat.

246
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,000
Ha, ha!

247
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,240
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

248
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,320
But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

249
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,280
I'll miss you.

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,080
Goodbye.

251
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,040
Okay, Abu. Go.

252
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

253
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,040
Get your paws off that.

254
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Why, you...

255
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!

256
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,880
Goodbye.

257
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,120
Nice going, Abu.

258
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Breakfast is served.

259
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,880
Pretty lady, buy a pot.

260
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,200
No finer pot in brass or silver.

261
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Sugar dates.
Sugar dates and figs.

262
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,800
Sugar dates and pistachios.

263
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,600
Would the lady like a necklace?

264
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,120
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

265
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,520
Fresh fish!

266
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,000
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

267
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,680
Oh, no. I don't think so.

268
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
Oh!

269
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,960
Excuse me.

270
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm really very sorry.

271
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,640
Wow.

272
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,560
Uh-oh.

273
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,600
Hello. Hello?

274
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,920
Oh, you must be hungry.

275
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
Here you go.

276
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,680
You'd better be able to pay for that.

277
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,800
Pay?

278
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
No one steals from my cart.

279
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,600
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.

280
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,040
- Thief!
- Please...

281
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,000
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the Sultan.

282
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,160
Do you know what
the penalty is for stealing?

283
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,880
No! No, please!

284
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
I've been looking all over for you.

286
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,920
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.

287
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,240
You, uh, know this girl?

288
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,800
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

289
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
She's a little crazy.

290
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,160
She said she knew the Sultan.

291
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,960
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

292
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,360
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

293
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Tragic, isn't it?

294
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,600
But no harm done.

295
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,400
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

296
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,840
Oh, hello, Doctor.
How are you?

297
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,400
- No, no, no. Not that one.
- Come on, Sultan.

298
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,680
Huh. What?

299
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,040
Come back here, you little thieves!

300
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,680
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness,

301
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,200
couldn't we just wait
for a real storm?

302
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,160
Save your breath, lago. Faster.

303
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,800
Yes, O mighty Evil One.

304
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,160
Part, sands of time.

305
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

306
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,480
Yes! Yes!

307
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,840
There he is.

308
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,200
My diamond in the rough.

309
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,680
That's him. That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

310
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,800
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

311
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
Swell.

312
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,120
Almost there.

313
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,480
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

314
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,120
Uh, forget it.

315
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,360
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

316
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
Is it that obvious?

317
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,160
Well, you do kind of stand out.

318
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,400
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

319
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,960
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

320
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,480
Wow.

321
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,680
Hey.

322
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,640
Come on. This way.

323
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,640
Whoa. Watch your head there.

324
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
Be careful.

325
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,000
Is this where you live?

326
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,160
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

327
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,120
That sounds fabulous.

328
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,280
Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.

329
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?

330
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, it's wonderful.

331
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,920
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

332
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,360
and have servants and valets.

333
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,960
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

334
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,400
It's better than here.

335
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,160
You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.

336
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
You're not free to make
your own choices.

337
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,920
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

338
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,160
...trapped.

339
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,240
So, where are you from?

340
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,840
What does it matter?

341
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,400
I ran away
and I am not going back.

342
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,960
Really. How come?

343
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,640
Why, you...

344
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,800
My father's forcing me
to get married.

345
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,560
That's... that's awful.

346
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,920
Abu!

347
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,120
What?

348
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,680
Abu says, uh...
that's not fair.

349
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
What?

350
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,200
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.

351
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,880
And does Abu
have anything else to say?

352
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,320
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

353
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Oh, boy.

354
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,040
Hmm.

355
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,480
Tell him that's very sweet.

356
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,040
Here you are.

357
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,400
- They're after me! You?
- My father must have sent them...

358
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,680
- Do you trust me?
- What?

359
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,640
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

360
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
Then jump!

361
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,760
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

362
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,520
Run! Go! Get out of here!

363
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,960
Get this thing off of me!

364
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,800
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.

365
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,120
Let him go.

366
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,520
- Looky here, men. A street mouse.

367
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,040
Unhand him,
by order of the princess.

368
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,040
Princess Jasmine.

369
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,800
- The princess?
- Princess?

370
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,800
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

371
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,520
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

372
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,640
I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

373
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,480
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

374
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,280
Jafar?

375
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,080
Oh, Princess.

376
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,480
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

377
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,680
How may I be of service to you?

378
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,960
The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

379
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,120
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

380
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

381
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,960
I can't breathe, Jafar.

382
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,480
Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

383
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,800
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!

384
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,440
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.

385
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,320
Oh, dear.

386
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,520
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...

387
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,760
What do you mean?

388
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,280
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

389
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,760
What sentence?

390
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
Death.

391
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,680
- By beheading.
- No.

392
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,560
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

393
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,200
How could you?

394
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
So, how did it go?

395
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,280
I think she took it... rather well.

396
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,160
It's all my fault, Rajah.

397
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
- I didn't even know his name.

398
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,720
She was the princess.

399
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,040
I can't believe it.

400
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,360
I must have sounded
so stupid to her.

401
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,720
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!

402
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,080
Hello!

403
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,760
Abu. Down here.

404
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,920
Come on, help me out of these.

405
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,200
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.

406
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Don't worry.
I'll never see her again.

408
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

409
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
She's gotta marry a prince.

410
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,840
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

411
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,880
I'm a fool.

412
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,760
You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.

413
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,040
Who are you?

414
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,400
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

415
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,280
But together,
perhaps we can be more.

416
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm listening.

417
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,400
There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,

418
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

419
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,200
Ooh!

420
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,080
Treasure enough to impress even
your princess, I'd wager.

421
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,640
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.

422
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,200
But the law says only a prince can...

423
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,000
You've heard of the golden rule,
haven't you?

424
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,400
Whoever has the gold
makes the rules.

425
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,040
Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?

426
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,480
I need a young pair of legs and
a strong back to go in after it.

427
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,160
Uh, one problem.

428
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,200
It's out there.
We're in here.

429
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,840
Uh-uh. Things aren't always
what they seem.

430
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,600
So...

431
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
do we have a deal?

432
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
Oh, I don't know.

433
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,200
Who disturbs my slumber?

434
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
Uh, it is l, Aladdin.

435
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,880
Proceed.

436
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,840
Touch nothing but the lamp.

437
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,000
Remember, boy,
first fetch me the lamp,

438
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,880
and then you shall
have your reward.

439
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,640
Come on, Abu.

440
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,640
Would you look at that!

441
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,560
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the Sultan.

442
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
Abu!

443
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,200
Don't... touch... anything.

444
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,880
We gotta find that lamp.

445
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,280
Huh?

446
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,080
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?

447
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,680
Abu, what are you, crazy?

448
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,800
A magic carpet.

449
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,160
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

450
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,440
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.

451
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
Thanks.

452
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,520
Wait a minute. Don't go.

453
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,440
Maybe you can help us.

454
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,080
Hey! Whoa!

455
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,640
You see, we're trying
to find this lamp.

456
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,880
I think he knows where it is.

457
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,600
Wait here.

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Oh!

459
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,520
This is it?

460
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,840
This is what we came
all the way down here to...

461
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,760
Abu! No!

462
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,200
- lnfidels!
- Uh-oh.

463
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,120
You have touched
the forbidden treasure!

464
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,320
Now you will never again
see the light of day!

465
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,080
Whoa!

466
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,680
Help! Help! Help!

467
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,160
Gotcha!

468
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,640
Carpet, let's move.

469
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,640
Abu!

470
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,680
Abu, this is no time to panic.

471
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,680
Start panicking.

472
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Whoa!

473
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,720
- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.

474
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,240
I can't hold on.
Give me your hand.

475
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,040
First give me the lamp.

476
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,800
Yes!

477
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,200
At last!

478
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,560
What are you doing?

479
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,040
Giving you your reward.

480
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,840
Your eternal reward.

481
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,200
It's mine.

482
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,600
It's all mine.

483
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,320
I... where is it?

484
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,560
No.

485
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,640
No!

486
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,280
Jasmine?

487
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,440
Oh, dearest.

488
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,120
What's wrong?

489
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,560
Jafar has...

490
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,920
done something terrible.

491
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,680
There, there, my dear.

492
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,040
We'll set it right.

493
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,480
Now, tell me everything.

494
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,880
Oh.

495
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
Aladdin. Wake up.

496
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,080
Aladdin.

497
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,840
Oh! My head.

498
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,080
We're trapped.

499
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,080
That two-faced son of a jackal!

500
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,760
Whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

501
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,960
Aha!

502
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,680
Why, you hairy little thief.

503
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,240
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

504
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,680
Hey, I think there's
something written here,

505
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,920
but it's hard to make out.

506
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,600
Aaaaahhhhh!

507
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,760
Oy!

508
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,320
10,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

509
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,760
Hang on a second.

510
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,720
Whoa! Whoa!

511
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,680
Does it feel good
to be outta there.

512
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Nice to be back,
ladies and gentlemen.

513
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,960
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

514
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,440
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

515
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,320
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

516
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Can we call you "Al"?
Or maybe just "Din."

517
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,000
How about "Laddie"?
Sounds like, "Here, boy. C'mon, Laddie."

518
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,600
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

519
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,480
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?

520
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,040
Oh, sorry, Cheetah.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.

521
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,760
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.

522
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,280
Give me some tass-el.
Yeah. Yo, yo.

523
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,720
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

524
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,160
That or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look from the side. Do I look different?

525
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,200
Wait a minute.
I'm your master?

526
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,120
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

527
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,400
The ever impressive,

528
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,200
the long contained,

529
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,560
often imitated,

530
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,520
but never duplicated...

531
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Duplicated, duplicated...

532
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,160
Genie...

533
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
of the Lamp!

534
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,280
Right here direct from the lamp,

535
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,640
right here for your
very much wish fulfillment.

536
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,040
Thank you.

537
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,720
Whoa. Wish fulfillment?

538
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,160
Three wishes to be exact.

539
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,880
And ix-nay on the wishing
for more wishes.

540
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,720
That's it. Three.
Uno, dos, tres.

541
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,000
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.

542
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,200
Now I know I'm dreaming.

543
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,200
Master, I don't think you quite realize
what you've got here.

544
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,440
So why don't you just ruminate

545
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,360
whilst I illuminate
the possibilities.

546
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,760
#Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves#

547
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,560
#Scheherazade had a thousand tales#

548
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,440
#But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves#

549
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,800
#You got a brand of magic never fails#

550
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,160
#You got some power in your corner now#

551
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,440
#Some heavy ammunition in your camp#

552
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,880
#You got some punch pizzazz
Yahoo and how#

553
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,480
#See, all you gotta do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say#

554
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,800
#Mr. Aladdin, sir,
What will your pleasure be#

555
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,240
#Let me take your order
Jot it down#

556
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,120
#You ain't never had a friend like me#

557
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,240
#Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'#

558
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,960
#Come on, whisper what it is you want#

559
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,920
#You ain't never had a friend like me#

560
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,480
#Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service#

561
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,640
#You're the boss, the king, the shah#

562
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,360
#Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish#

563
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,920
#How 'bout a little more baklava#?

564
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,200
#Have some of column A
Try all of column B#

565
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,840
#I'm in the mood to help you, dude#

566
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,080
#You ain't never had a friend like me#

567
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,840
#Oh, my#

568
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,040
#No, no#

569
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,360
#My, my#

570
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,280
#Can your friends do this#?

571
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,200
#Can your friends do that#?

572
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
#Can your friends pull this#

573
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,160
#Out their little hat#?

574
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,560
#Can your friends go poof#?

575
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,240
Hey, looky here. Ha ha!

576
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,720
#Can your friends go
Abracadabra, let her rip#

577
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
#And then make the sucker disappear#

578
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,600
#So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed#

579
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
#I'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers#

580
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,840
#You got me bona fide certified#

581
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,200
#You got a genie
For your charge d'affaires#

582
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,560
#I got a powerful urge to help you out#

583
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,040
#So what's your wish
I really wanna know#

584
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,720
#You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt#

585
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,920
#All you gotta do is rub like so#

586
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,680
#Mr. Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three#

587
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,120
#I'm on the job, you big nabob#

588
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,120
#You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend#

589
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,360
#You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend#

590
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
#You ain't never#

591
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
#Had a#

592
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,240
#Friend#

593
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
#Like#

594
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,240
#Me#

595
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,400
Ah ha ha!

596
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,920
Wah ha ha!

597
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,720
#You ain't never had a friend like me#

598
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,440
Huh?

599
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,560
So, what'll it be, Master?

600
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,800
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

601
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
Ah, almost.

602
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,160
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

603
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,200
Like?

604
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,600
Ah, rule number one:
I can't kill anybody.

605
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,880
So don't ask.

606
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,280
Rule number two.

607
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,200
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

608
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,200
You little punim there.

609
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,400
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

610
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,600
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

611
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,880
Other than that, you got it.

612
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,680
- Hmm.
- Oh!

613
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,680
Provisos?
You mean limitations?

614
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
On wishes?
Some all-powerful genie.

615
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,240
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

616
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,840
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

617
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,040
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out.

618
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,000
Excuse me?

619
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,920
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

620
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,680
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

621
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,680
And you're walking out on me?

622
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,840
I don't think so,
not right now.

623
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
You're gettin' your wishes,
so sit down!

624
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,480
- In case of emergency,

625
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,800
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

626
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,400
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

627
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,360
We're...

628
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,880
outta here!

629
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,280
Jafar, this is an outrage.

630
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,240
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

631
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,200
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

632
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,720
before they are beheaded.

633
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,640
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

634
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
Jasmine...

635
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,880
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

636
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,000
Please.

637
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,000
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.

638
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,200
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

639
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,240
When I am queen, I will have
the power to get rid of you.

640
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,440
That's nice.
All settled, then.

641
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,600
Now, Jasmine, getting back to
this suitor business... Jasmine?

642
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,760
Jasmine!

643
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,360
If only I had gotten that lamp.

644
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,560
"l will have the power
to get rid of you."

645
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,520
To think
we gotta keep kissing up

646
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,400
to that chump
and his chump daughter

647
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,040
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, lago.

648
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,560
Only until she finds
a chump husband.

649
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,440
Then she'll have us banished.

650
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,000
Or beheaded.

651
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,920
Eww!

652
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
Oh. Wait a minute.

653
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
Jafar. What if you were
the chump husband?

654
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,920
What?

655
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,400
Okay, you marry
the princess, all right?

656
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,080
And, uh, then you
become the sultan.

657
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,440
Oh.

658
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,960
Marry the shrew.

659
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,360
I become the sultan.

660
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,320
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

661
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:56,040
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

662
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,560
Yaaah!

663
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Kersplat!

664
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,280
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

665
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,640
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

666
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,320
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

667
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,360
Thank you.
Goodbye now. Good-ye.

668
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,480
Thank you.

669
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,480
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

670
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,200
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

671
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,360
Dost mine ears deceive me?

672
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,760
Three. You are down by one, boy.

673
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,440
Ah, no. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

674
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,200
You did that on your own.

675
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,920
Well, I feel sheepish.

676
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,120
All right, you baaad boy,
but no more freebies.

677
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,360
Fair deal.
So, three wishes.

678
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,360
I want them to be good.

679
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,080
What would you wish for?

680
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,040
Me?

681
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,240
No one's ever asked me that before.

682
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,120
Well, in my case...
Ah, forget it.

683
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,080
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

684
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,360
Come on. Tell me.

685
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,520
Freedom.

686
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,400
You're a prisoner?

687
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,840
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

688
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,480
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

689
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,880
Itty bitty living space.

690
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,040
Genie, that's terrible.

691
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,520
But, oh, to be free.

692
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,840
Not have to go,
"Poof. What do you need?

693
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

694
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,360
To be my own master.

695
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,080
Such a thing would be
greater than all the magic

696
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,720
and all the treasures
in all the world.

697
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,600
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.

698
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,040
It's not gonna happen.

699
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,200
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

700
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,560
Why not?

701
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,320
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

702
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,680
So you can guess how often
that's happened.

703
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,400
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

704
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,640
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

705
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,440
after I make my first two wishes,

706
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,680
I'll use my third wish
to set you free.

707
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,760
Well, here's hopin'.
All right.

708
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,080
Let's make some magic.

709
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,760
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

710
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,520
Well, there's this girl.

711
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,840
Wrong.

712
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,360
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

713
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,840
Oh, but, Genie,

714
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,720
she's smart and fun and...

715
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,680
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

716
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,160
She's got these eyes that just...
and this hair. Wow.

717
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,480
And her smile...

718
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,760
Ami.

719
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,880
C'est l'amour.

720
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
But she's the princess.

721
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,920
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...

722
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,800
Hey, can you make me a prince?

723
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,320
Let's see here.

724
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,080
Chicken à la king? Nope.

725
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,240
Alaskan king crab.
Ow. I hate it when they do that.

726
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,840
Caesar salad. Ah!
Et tu, Brute. No.

727
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,000
Aha. "To make a prince."

728
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,200
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

729
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,000
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

730
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,680
All right!

731
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,040
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

732
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,320
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

733
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,680
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

734
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,160
No. Let's work with me here.

735
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.

736
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,040
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

737
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,800
It says mode of transportation.

738
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,600
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aqui. Over here.

739
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,520
- Uh-oh.
- Here he comes.

740
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,560
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

741
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,360
than riding your very own
brand-new camel.

742
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Watch out. They spit.
Mmm. Not enough.

743
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,800
Still not enough.

744
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,560
Let's see.
What do you need?

745
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,160
Yes!

746
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,480
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

747
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,480
Whoa!

748
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

749
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,480
Abu, you look good.

750
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,960
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.

751
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,920
But we're not through yet.

752
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,440
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.

753
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,480
Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

754
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,000
Awk. The problem with your daughter.

755
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,240
Oh, really?

756
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,400
Right here.

757
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,280
"lf the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

758
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,560
then the sultan shall
choose for her."

759
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,360
But Jasmine hated
all those suitors.

760
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,560
How could I choose
someone she hates?

761
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,480
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.

762
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,360
"lf in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found,"

763
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,400
Jerk.

764
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,320
"a princess must then be wed to..."

765
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,680
Hmm. Interesting.

766
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,440
What? Who?

767
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,080
The royal vizier.

768
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,520
Why, that would be... me.

769
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,280
But I thought the law says

770
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,600
that only a prince
can marry a princess.

771
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,120
I'm quite sure that...

772
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,920
Desperate times call for
desperate measures, my lord.

773
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,040
Yes. Desperate measures.

774
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,080
You will order
the princess to marry me.

775
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,320
I will order...

776
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,000
the princess...

777
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,200
to...

778
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,600
But you're so old.

779
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,960
The princess will marry me.

780
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,600
The princess will marry...

781
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,360
- What. What is that?

782
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,760
That music.

783
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,760
Jafar, you must come
and see this.

784
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,960
#Make way for Prince Ali#

785
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,280
#Say hey#

786
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,560
#It's Prince Ali#

787
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,560
#Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar#

788
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,280
#Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star#

789
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,480
#Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye#

790
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,840
#Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums#

791
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,440
#You're gonna love this guy#

792
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,840
#Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa#

793
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,280
#Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee#

794
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,640
#Now, try your best to stay calm#

795
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,240
#Brush up your Sunday salaam#

796
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,880
#Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie#

797
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,720
#Prince Ali, mighty is he,
Ali Ababwa#

798
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,640
#Strong as ten regular men definitely#

799
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,440
#He faced the galloping hordes#

800
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,680
#A hundred bad guys with swords#

801
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,560
#Who sent those goons to their lords
Why, Prince Ali#

802
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,240
#He's got 75 golden camels#

803
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,720
Don't they look lovely, June?

804
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,320
#Purple peacocks, he's got 53#

805
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,200
Fabulous, Harry.
I love the feathers.

806
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,800
#When it comes to exotic-type mammals#

807
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,120
#Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you#

808
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,640
#It's a world-class menagerie#

809
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,400
#Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa#

810
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,160
#That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee#

811
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,920
#Well, get on out in that square#

812
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
#Adjust your veil and prepare#

813
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,040
#To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali#

814
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,800
- #He's got 95 white Persian monkeys#
- #He's got the monkeys#

815
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,920
- #Let's see the monkeys#
- #And to view them he charges no fee#

816
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,240
#He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies#

817
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,000
#Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him#

818
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,120
#They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali#

819
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,080
#Prince Ali#

820
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:41,040
#Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa#

821
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,560
#Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see#

822
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,880
#And that, good people, is why#

823
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,560
#He got dolled up and dropped by#

824
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,360
#With 60 elephants, llamas galore#

825
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,360
#With bears and lions,
A brass band and more#

826
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,240
#With his 40 fakirs,
His cooks, his bakers#

827
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,640
#His birds that warble on key#

828
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,760
#Make way#

829
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,880
#For Prince Ali#

830
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,240
Splendid.
Absolutely marvelous.

831
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,520
Your Majesty,

832
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,400
I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

833
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,400
Prince Ali Ababwa.

834
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,000
Of course.
I'm delighted to meet you.

835
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,160
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.

836
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,360
Ecstatic.

837
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,120
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
- Ababwa.

838
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,480
Whatever.

839
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,400
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to...

840
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,640
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.

841
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,160
Ooh.

842
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,720
I don't suppose I might...

843
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,320
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

844
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,360
Sire, I must advise against this.

845
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,560
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

846
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,120
Ow, ow, ow.

847
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,400
Ahh! Whoa!

848
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,920
Just where did you say
you were from?

849
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,800
Oh, much farther than
you've traveled, I'm sure.

850
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,760
- Try me.
- Look out, Polly.

851
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,800
Hey, watch it.

852
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,920
Watch it with the dumb rug.

853
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,880
Aah!

854
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Whew!

855
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,520
Out of the way.
I'm coming in to land.

856
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,000
Jafar, watch this.

857
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,320
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.

858
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,240
Yes, I do seem
to have a knack for it.

859
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,560
This is a very impressive youth.

860
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,920
And a prince besides.

861
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,400
If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.

862
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,080
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.

863
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,240
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,

864
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,240
I'm an excellent judge of character.

865
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,240
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure. Not!

866
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,360
Jasmine will like this one.

867
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,840
And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.

868
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,600
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

869
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,720
This boy is no different
from the others.

870
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,640
What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?

871
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,480
Your Majesty,
I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

872
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,720
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

873
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,160
How dare you.

874
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,000
All of you. Standing around
deciding my future?

875
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,760
I am not a prize to be won.

876
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,200
Oh, dear.

877
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,600
Don't worry, Prince Ali.

878
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,200
Just give Jasmine time
to cool down.

879
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,320
I think it's time to say good-bye
to Prince Abooboo.

880
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,840
What am I gonna do?

881
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,000
Jasmine won't even
let me talk to her.

882
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,640
I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

883
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,360
So move.

884
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,320
Hey.

885
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,600
That's a good move.

886
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,160
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.

887
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,400
Genie, I need help.

888
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,440
All right, Sparky,
here's the deal.

889
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,440
If you wanna court
the little lady,

890
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,360
you gotta be
a straight shooter.

891
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,280
- Do you got it?
- What?

892
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,400
Tell her the...

893
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,240
-...truth!
- No way.

894
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,960
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

895
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,000
she'd laugh at me.

896
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,440
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

897
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,480
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

898
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,480
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

899
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,440
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

900
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,960
I just... I gotta be smooth,
cool, confident.

901
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
How do I look?

902
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,280
Like a prince.

903
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,560
Princess Jasmine?

904
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,480
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

905
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,800
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

906
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,520
I do not want to see you.

907
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

908
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,480
- Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

909
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,960
So, how's our little beau doing?

910
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,640
Good kitty, take off.

911
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,120
Down, kitty.

912
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,200
Wait. Wait.

913
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,600
Do I know you?

914
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,000
Uh, no. No.

915
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,200
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

916
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,680
The marketplace?

917
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,520
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

918
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,600
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants.

919
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,800
It couldn't have been me you met.

920
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,360
No. I guess not.

921
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,920
Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

922
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,640
She's smart, fun,
the hair, the eyes.

923
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,200
Anything. Pick a feature.

924
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,080
Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...

925
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,360
- Wonderful, magnificent, punctual.
-...punctual.

926
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,520
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

927
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,800
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

928
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,880
Hmm.

929
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,080
I'm rich, too, you know.

930
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,960
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

931
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,960
I know.

932
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,520
A fine prize
for any prince to marry.

933
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,440
Uh, right. Right.
A prince like me.

934
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,640
Warning! Warning!

935
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,720
Right. A prince like you.

936
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,160
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

937
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,760
Mayday! Mayday!

938
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,360
Just go jump off
a balcony!

939
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,520
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

940
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,840
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

941
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,400
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

942
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,200
- Yeah, right.
- What?

943
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,400
Uh... Uh, you're right.

944
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,520
You aren't just
some prize to be won.

945
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,280
You should be free
to make your own choice.

946
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,600
I'll go now.

947
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,440
- No!
- What? What?

948
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,720
How...

949
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,240
How are you doing that?

950
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,800
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

951
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,680
You, uh...

952
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,960
You don't want to go
for a ride, do you?

953
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,200
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

954
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,320
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

955
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,040
- What?
- Do you trust me?

956
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,480
Yes.

957
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:15,880
Yes.

958
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,560
#I can show you the world#

959
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,800
#Shining, shimmering, splendid#

960
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,400
#Tell me, Princess#

961
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,200
#Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide#

962
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,080
#I can open your eyes#

963
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,360
#Take you wonder by wonder#

964
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,120
#Over, sideways and under#

965
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,920
#On a magic carpet ride#

966
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,680
#A whole new world#

967
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,280
#A new fantastic point of view#

968
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,840
#No one to tell us no
Or where to go#

969
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,520
#Or say we're only dreaming#

970
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,280
#A whole new world#

971
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,240
#A dazzling place
I never knew#

972
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,600
#But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear#

973
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,880
#That now I'm in
A whole new world with you#

974
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,160
#Now I'm in
A whole new world with you#

975
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,000
#Unbelievable sights#

976
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,480
#Indescribable feeling#

977
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,480
#Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling#

978
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,520
#Through an endless diamond sky#

979
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,000
- #A whole new world#
- #Don't you dare close your eyes#

980
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,280
- #A hundred thousand things to see#
- #Hold your breath, it gets better#

981
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,720
#I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far#

982
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,000
#I can't go back to where I used to be#

983
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,800
- #A whole new world#
- #Every turn a surprise#

984
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,520
- #With new horizons to pursue#
- #Every moment, red-letter#

985
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,960
#I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare#

986
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,480
#Let me share
This whole new world with you#

987
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,360
- #A whole new world#
- #A whole new world#

988
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,240
- #That's where we'll be#
- #That's where we'll be#

989
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,960
- #A thrilling chase#
- #A wondrous place#

990
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,840
#For you and me#

991
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,120
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

992
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,040
It's a shame
Abu had to miss this.

993
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,200
Nah. He hates fireworks.

994
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,200
He doesn't like flying, either.

995
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,000
Uh, that is, um...
Oh, no.

996
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,160
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

997
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,640
- Why did you lie?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

998
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,560
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

999
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,480
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.

1000
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,160
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

1001
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,160
Who are you?
Tell me the truth.

1002
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,000
The truth?

1003
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,360
The truth. Um...

1004
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,720
The truth is...

1005
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,400
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um...

1006
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,000
to escape the pressures
of palace life.

1007
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,520
But I really am a prince.

1008
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,000
Why didn't you just tell me?

1009
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,640
Well, you know...

1010
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,840
royalty going out
into the city in disguise,

1011
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,640
it sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

1012
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,320
Hmm.

1013
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,800
Not that strange.

1014
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,520
Good night, my handsome prince.

1015
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,280
Sleep well, Princess.

1016
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,960
Yes!

1017
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,360
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

1018
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,440
Abu. Abu.

1019
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,600
Hold him.

1020
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,480
I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abooboo.

1021
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,960
Why, you...

1022
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,160
Make sure he's never found.

1023
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,840
Never fails. Get in the bath
and there's a rub at the lamp.

1024
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,360
Hello? Al?

1025
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,000
Al! Kid, snap out of it.

1026
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,600
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.

1027
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,600
You have to say, "Genie,
I want you to save my life." Got it?

1028
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,920
Come on, Aladdin!

1029
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,360
I'll take that as a yes.

1030
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,240
Up scope.

1031
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,040
Don't you scare me like that.

1032
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,600
Genie, l, uh...

1033
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,760
I...

1034
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,440
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

1035
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,640
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.

1036
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,240
Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.

1037
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,000
Jasmine.

1038
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,120
Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.

1039
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,240
- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

1040
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,600
I have chosen a husband for you.

1041
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,400
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.

1042
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,960
You're speechless, I see.

1043
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,840
A fine quality in a wife.

1044
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,680
I will never marry you.

1045
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,360
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

1046
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,600
Better check your
crystal ball again, Jafar.

1047
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,320
Prince Ali!

1048
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,960
How in the... uh. Awk!

1049
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,480
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

1050
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,560
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

1051
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,760
He is obviously lying.

1052
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,200
Obviously lying.

1053
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Father, what's wrong with you?

1054
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,080
I know what's wrong.

1055
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,120
Oh, my!

1056
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,640
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

1057
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,560
What? Jafar?

1058
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,520
You, you traitor!

1059
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,720
Your Majesty,
all this can be explained.

1060
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,600
Guards! Guards!

1061
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,240
Well, that's it.
We're dead. Forget it.

1062
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,400
Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.

1063
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,800
Arrest Jafar at once.

1064
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,280
This is not done yet, boy.

1065
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,360
Find him!

1066
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,160
- Search everywhere!
- Jasmine, are you all right?

1067
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,160
Yes.

1068
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,520
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,

1069
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,600
plotting against me all this time.

1070
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,720
This is horrible, just horrible.

1071
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,960
How will I ever...

1072
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,960
Huh?

1073
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,720
Can this be true?

1074
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,280
My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?

1075
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,440
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

1076
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,360
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.

1077
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,560
I won't.
I'll leave that to my...

1078
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,320
But you two will be wed at once.

1079
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,000
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy
and prosperous,

1080
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,160
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

1081
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,560
- Sultan?
- Yes.

1082
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,680
A fine upstanding youth
such as yourself,

1083
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,120
a person of your
unimpeachable moral character

1084
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,560
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

1085
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,120
We gotta get outta here.

1086
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,480
I gotta start packing.
Only essentials.

1087
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,840
We gotta travel light.

1088
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,720
Bring the guns, the weapons,
and how about this picture?

1089
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,480
I think I'm making a weird face in it.

1090
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,680
Oh, boy. He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.

1091
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,800
Jafar! Jafar!

1092
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,200
Get a grip!

1093
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,080
Good grip.

1094
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,920
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

1095
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,120
- He has the lamp, lago.
- Why, that miserable...

1096
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,840
But you are going
to relieve him of it.

1097
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,840
Me?

1098
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,440
Sultan?

1099
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,560
They want me to be Sultan?

1100
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,560
Huzzah!

1101
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,280
#Hail the conquering hero#

1102
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,480
Aladdin, you've just won
the heart of the princess.

1103
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,560
What are you gonna do next?

1104
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,120
Psst. Your line is,
"I'm going to free the genie."

1105
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Anytime.

1106
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,520
- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.

1107
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,960
You just go,
"Genie, I wish you free."

1108
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,040
I'm serious.

1109
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,960
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.

1110
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,520
No. They wanna make
Prince Ali sultan.

1111
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,800
Without you,
I'm just Aladdin.

1112
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,920
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.

1113
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,280
The only reason anyone thinks
I'm worth anything is because of you.

1114
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,440
What if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

1115
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,280
What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.

1116
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,480
Genie, I can't
keep this up on my own.

1117
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,200
I can't wish you free.

1118
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,960
Fine. I understand.
You've lied to everyone else.

1119
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,720
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

1120
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,200
Now, if you'll excuse me, Master.

1121
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,800
Genie, I'm really sorry.

1122
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,520
Well, fine.
Then just stay in there.

1123
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,400
What are you guys looking at?

1124
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,520
Look, l... I'm sorry.

1125
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,560
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

1126
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,560
Wait. Come on.

1127
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,160
What am I doing?

1128
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,680
Genie's right.

1129
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,160
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

1130
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,440
Ali. Oh, Ali.
Will you come here?

1131
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,800
Well, here goes.

1132
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,960
Jasmine?
Where are you?

1133
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,720
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

1134
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,760
I'm coming.

1135
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,320
You got a problem, Pinky?

1136
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,040
Jerk.

1137
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,440
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.

1138
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,320
- Excellent work, lago.
- Ah, go on.

1139
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,320
No, really. On a scale of
one to ten, you are an eleven.

1140
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,760
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

1141
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,680
I'm embarrassed.
I'm blushing.

1142
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,520
People of Agrabah,

1143
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,560
my daughter has finally
chosen a suitor.

1144
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,000
Jasmine.

1145
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,960
Ali, where have you been?

1146
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,200
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.

1147
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,120
The whole kingdom's turned out
for Father's announcement.

1148
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,400
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.

1149
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,400
- You don't understand...
- Good luck.

1150
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,200
...Ali Ababwa!

1151
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,880
Oh, boy.

1152
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,520
Look at them,
cheering that little pipsqueak.

1153
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:29,680
Let them cheer.

1154
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,800
Let them cheer.

1155
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,720
You know, Al, I'm getting really...

1156
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,200
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al

1157
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,440
will be played by a tall, dark
and sinister ugly man.

1158
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,240
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.

1159
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,200
Genie, grant me my first wish.

1160
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,960
I wish to rule on high as sultan.

1161
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,920
- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.

1162
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,800
What is this?

1163
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,880
What's going on?
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

1164
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,920
Father.

1165
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,000
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

1166
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,920
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

1167
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Oh, yeah?
We'll just see about that.

1168
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,840
The lamp.

1169
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,160
Finders keepers, Abooboo.

1170
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,400
Genie, no!

1171
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,920
Sorry, kid.
I got a new master now.

1172
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,040
Jafar, I order you to stop.

1173
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,160
Ah, but there's a new order now.

1174
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,960
My order.

1175
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,960
Finally, you will bow to me.

1176
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,880
We will never bow to you.

1177
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,000
Why am I not surprised?

1178
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,440
If you won't bow before a sultan,

1179
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,560
then you will cower
before a sorcerer!

1180
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,840
Genie, my second wish...

1181
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,080
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer
in the world!

1182
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,040
Genie, stop!

1183
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

1184
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,320
a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!

1185
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,280
Now, where were we?

1186
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,800
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

1187
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,920
Down, boy.

1188
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,200
Oh, Princess.

1189
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,040
There's someone I'm dying
to introduce you to.

1190
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,640
Jafar. Get your hands off her.

1191
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,640
#Prince Ali
Yes, it is he#

1192
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,760
#But not as you know him#

1193
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,880
#Read my lips
And come to grips with reality#

1194
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,960
#Yes, meet a blast from your past#

1195
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,400
#Whose lies were too good to last#

1196
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,800
#Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali#

1197
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,360
Or should we say Aladdin?

1198
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,400
Ali?

1199
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,560
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I'm just...

1200
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,880
#So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin#

1201
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,000
#Just a con, need I go on#

1202
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,280
#Take it from me#

1203
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,520
#His personality flaws#

1204
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,560
#Give me adequate cause#

1205
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,400
#To send him packing
On a one-way trip#

1206
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,720
#So his prospects
Take a terminal dip#

1207
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,760
#His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!#

1208
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,120
- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.

1209
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:30,040
#Ex-Prince Ali#

1210
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,640
Abu.

1211
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,760
Abu!

1212
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,680
Oh, this is all my fault.

1213
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,760
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance. Abu.

1214
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,160
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1215
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,080
I'm sorry, Abu.

1216
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,760
I made a mess of everything.

1217
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,280
Somehow... I gotta go back
and set things right.

1218
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,720
Carpet.

1219
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,240
Abu, start digging.

1220
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,360
That's it.

1221
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,800
Yeah! All right!

1222
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,640
Now, back to Agrabah.
Let's go.

1223
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,040
Puppet ruler want a cracker?

1224
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,800
Here's your cracker.
Shoved all the way down your throat.

1225
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,120
Here. Have lots.

1226
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,680
Stop it.
Jafar, leave him alone.

1227
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,560
It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

1228
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,760
A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself

1229
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,520
should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world.

1230
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,440
What do you say, my dear?

1231
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,160
Why, with you as my queen...

1232
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Never.

1233
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,840
I'll teach you some respect.

1234
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,600
No. Genie.

1235
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,040
I have decided
to make my final wish.

1236
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,000
I wish for Princess Jasmine

1237
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,920
to fall desperately
in love with me.

1238
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,320
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quo...

1239
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,360
Don't talk back to me,
you big blue lout.

1240
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,240
You will do what
I order you to do, slave.

1241
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,160
Jafar.

1242
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,880
I never realized how...
incredibly handsome you are.

1243
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,120
Mmm. That's better.

1244
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,760
Now, pussycat...

1245
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,720
tell me more about myself.

1246
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,680
You're tall...

1247
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,000
dark...

1248
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,000
well dressed...

1249
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,320
Al. Al, little buddy.

1250
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,840
Shh.

1251
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,560
Al, I can't help you.

1252
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,280
I work for Señor Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?

1253
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,240
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise.

1254
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,720
...cute little gaps
between your teeth.

1255
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,640
Go on.

1256
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,160
And your beard...

1257
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,240
is so... twisted.

1258
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,400
- You've stolen my heart.
- Jaf...!

1259
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,000
- And the street rat?

1260
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,720
What street rat?

1261
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,080
Yech!

1262
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,280
That was...

1263
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,400
You!

1264
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,560
How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?

1265
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,880
Get the lamp.

1266
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,880
No!

1267
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,520
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.

1268
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,200
Jasmine.

1269
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,880
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...

1270
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,680
Don't toy with me.

1271
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,120
Abu!

1272
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,400
Things are unraveling
fast now, boy.

1273
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,800
Get the point?

1274
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,120
I'm just getting warmed up.

1275
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,520
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1276
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,400
A snake, am l?

1277
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,080
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

1278
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,960
#Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake#

1279
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,520
You stay out of this.

1280
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,840
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... great!

1281
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,520
Aladdin.

1282
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,840
Jasmine, hang on.

1283
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,960
You little fool.

1284
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,120
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

1285
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,280
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!

1286
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:32,200
Without the genie, boy,
you're nothing.

1287
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,320
The genie. The genie.

1288
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,120
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

1289
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,200
What?

1290
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,560
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.

1291
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,240
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

1292
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,920
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.

1293
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,240
You're right.

1294
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,960
His power does exceed my own.

1295
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,040
But not for long.

1296
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:59,120
The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

1297
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,720
One too many hits with the snake.

1298
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,560
Slave, I make my third wish.

1299
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,720
I wish to be
an all-powerful genie!

1300
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,880
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.

1301
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,240
Yes.

1302
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,040
Yes!

1303
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,680
The power.

1304
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,400
The absolute power!

1305
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,560
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1306
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,560
The universe is mine to command,
to control!

1307
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,280
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1308
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,520
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie...

1309
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,840
you got it.

1310
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,120
What?

1311
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,440
And everything that goes with it.

1312
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,920
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.

1313
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,920
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

1314
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You're the genie. I don't want...

1315
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,320
Itty bitty living space.

1316
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,480
Al, you little genius, you.

1317
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,720
Ahh!

1318
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,200
Get your blasted beak
out of my face.

1319
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,400
- Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1320
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,720
Allow me.

1321
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,000
10,000 years in a Cave of Wonders
ought to chill him out.

1322
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,120
Shut up!

1323
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,960
Jasmine...

1324
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,400
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1325
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,000
I know why you did.

1326
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,640
Well, I guess...

1327
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,560
this is good-bye?

1328
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,720
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.

1329
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,360
I love you.

1330
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,200
Al, no problem.

1331
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,160
You've still got one wish left.

1332
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,360
Just say the word
and you're a prince again.

1333
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,360
But, Genie,
what about your freedom?

1334
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,400
Hey, it's only
an eternity of servitude.

1335
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,360
This is love.

1336
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,640
Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.

1337
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,400
Believe me, I know.
I've looked.

1338
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,120
Jasmine, I do love you,

1339
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,880
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1340
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,160
I understand.

1341
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,760
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1342
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,800
One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.

1343
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,600
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

1344
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,680
I'm free. I'm free.

1345
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,160
Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.

1346
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,360
Say, "l want the Nile." Try that.

1347
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,120
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!

1348
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,080
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1349
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:15,280
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1350
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,720
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world.

1351
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,480
I'm...

1352
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,440
Genie, I'm...

1353
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,000
I'm gonna miss you.

1354
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,240
Me, too, Al.

1355
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,280
No matter
what anybody says,

1356
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,280
you'll always be a prince to me.

1357
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,400
That's right.

1358
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,280
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

1359
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,640
It's that law
that's the problem.

1360
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,840
- Father?
- Well, am I Sultan or am I Sultan?

1361
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,440
From this day forth,

1362
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,000
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

1363
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,440
Him. I choose...

1364
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,880
I choose you, Aladdin.

1365
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,760
Call me Al.

1366
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,240
Oh, all of ya, come over here.
Big group hug.

1367
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,840
Group hug.

1368
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,800
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1369
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,120
Ooh, hairball.

1370
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,120
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

1371
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,080
I'm outta here!

1372
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,480
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1373
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,280
Hey, Rugman, ciao.
I'm history.

1374
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,840
No, I'm mythology.

1375
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,800
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

1376
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,120
#A whole new world#

1377
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,600
#A whole new life#

1378
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,160
#For you and me#

1379
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,480
#A whole new world #?

1380
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,400
Made you look.

ALADDIN
In a faraway land, where the sun scorched the fiery desert, there Lied an ancient secret.
It is a lamp, long forgotten and buried deep beneath the sand.
It is small and simple.
It bears no fancy design and contains no precious jewels.
To all but the wisest among us, it would appear dull and worthless.
But this lamp is not what it seems.
Long ago, it held the greatest power in all the land of Arabia.
lt's magic changed forever the course of a young man's life.
A young man who, like the lamp, was more than what he seemed.
The tale begins on a dark night, where a dark man waits with a dark purpose. . . .
CHAPTER ONE
The man's name was Jafar, and he was prepared to wait.
His beady eyes and pointed turban gave him the look of a cobra about to strike.
Perched on his shoulder, a parrot cocked its head impatiently.
Beneath him, his horse shifted and gave a restless snort.
The treasure was buried out there somewhere.
Only one person would be able to find it— the person who possessed two halves of an ancient scarab.
Jafar had one half, and soon he would have the other.
Then the treasure would be his.
And with it, he would become the most powerful man in Agrabah.
In the stillness, Jafar heard the clopping of hooves as a rider approached.
The man was a common thief named Gazeem, and he had agreed to
bring Jafar the other half of the scarab— in return for a part of the treasure.
Jafar had promised. Jafar had lied.
"You are late," he said.
Gazeem dismounted and bowed his head.
Jafar was the royal vizier, the chief adviser to the sultan. It was not wise to upset him.
"My apologies, O Patient One" Gazeem said.
Jafar glared. "You have it, then?"
With a grin, the thief pulled half the scarab from his pocket.
Jafar reached for it, but the thief held it back.
"What about the treasure? You promised me."
Screech!
The parrot swooped down from Jafar's shoulder, grabbed the scarab, and dropped it into Jafar's bony
hand.
"Trust me," Jafar said. "You'll get what's coming to you."
Quickly he took out his half of the scarab.
He could feel his blood pounding as he fit the halves together.
They glowed. Then ...
BOOOOOM!
A clap of thunder shook the desert.
The scarab leapt from Jafar's hand as if it were alive.
It streaked across the dunes in a blaze of light.
Jafar spurred on his horse.
"Quickly, follow the trail!" he shouted.
Gazeem mounted his own horse and raced after Jafar.
Bright as a comet, the scarab shot toward a small sandstone.
It circled around it, then paused in the air.
Crack!
The scarab suddenly split into halves again and plunged into the rock, each half wedging into a small
hole.
Jafar stopped his horse and jumped off.
The pulsing scarab stared out at him like a huge pair of eyes.
An exhilarating chill bolted through him.
There was no turning back now.
RRRRRRRROMMMMMM!
The earth began to tremble.
The strange eyes flashed wildly.
Gazeem cowered in fright.
Slowly the rock began to grow upward.
It expanded in all directions, changing shape.
The eyes remained, and now ears formed, then a nose.
Last was a mouth, huge and gaping.
A column of white light burst from within, almost blinding Jafar.
The rock was now a tiger face, frozen in a furious, silent roar.
Jafar stared in awe.
His frightened parrot clung to his shoulder, digging in its claws.
"By Allah!" Gazeem murmured. "A tiger-god!"
"At last, lago!" Jafar said to his parrot. "After all my years of searching—the Cave of Wonders!"
"Awk" lago screeched. "Cave of Wonders!"
Jafar pulled Gazeem close to him.
"Now, remember" he snarled.
"Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!"
Gazeem swallowed hard.
He turned toward the mouth of the tiger-god and began walking slowly.
''Awk! The lamp!" lago repeated, loud enough for Gazeem to hear.
Then he leaned in close to Jafar's ear and whispered, "Geez, where'd you dig this bozo up?"
"Ssshh!" Jafar snapped.
lago allowed no one to know he could speak like a human—no one except his master, that is.
But right now, Jafar was in no mood to listen.
He was watching.
Watching and waiting.
"Who disturbs my slumber!" boomed the tiger-god, its voice rumbling the ground once again.
"Er ... it is I, Gazeem, a humble thief."
His voice was a nervous squeak, and his knees felt weak and shaky.
"Know this!" the tiger-god said. "Only one may enter here.
One whose rags hide a heart that is pure — the Diamond in the Rough!"
Gazeem cast a doubtful glance behind him.
"Go on!" Jafar commanded.
Frightened, Qazeem turned back toward the cave's opening.
A flight of stairs led downward into ... what? He couldn't tell. Carefully he began walking down.
RRRRRAAAAUUUQQHHHHH!
The tiger-god's thunderous roar was like nothing Jafar had ever heard.
Gazeem's shriek could be heard only for a moment, and then the tiger-god's mouth slammed shut,
silencing the thief forever.
''Seek thee out the Diamond in the Rough!" the tiger-god commanded.
Slowly the rock collapsed into a mound of sand.
The scarab halves flickered, then went dark.
Jafar stared in silence as lago dove into the mound and resurfaced, spitting out sand.
He picked the scarab halves up and flew back to Jafar.
"I can't believe this!" lago said. "We're never going to get ahold of that stupid lamp!"
"Patience, lago, patience. Gazeem was obviously less than worthy."
"Now there's a big surprise!" lago said, rolling his eyes. "So what are we going to do? We've got a big
problem here—"
But Jafar just reached out and squeezed lago's beak shut. He needed quiet.
"Only one may enter..." he said. "I must find this one—this Diamond in the Rough."
The Diamond in the Rough—Jafar understood what that meant.
A common person, poor and unwashed, who had shining qualities within.
There was only one way to seek this person out, and Jafar knew just how to do it.
An evil grin spread across his face.
He hadn't gotten the treasure tonight, but no matter.
He was close—oh so close.
And before long, his waiting would be over.
CHAPTER TWO
Stop, thief!"
The guard shouted at the top of his lungs as he chased a raggedly dressed boy through the crowded
marketplace of Agrabah.
The boy zigzagged skillfully around the outdoor stands—fruit sellers, clothing merchants, bakers, trinket
sellers.
In his right hand, he clutched a loaf of bread.
Beside him ran a small monkey dressed in a vest and a hat.
I'll get you, street rat!" the guard shouted.
Street rat. If there was one name Aladdin hated, that was it.
The sultan's guards looked down on the poor people of Agrabah—people such as himself.
Sure, he swiped food sometimes.
He had no choice— he had to eat.
But he was no street rat.
"Come on, Abu!" Aladdin called to his pet monkey.
He ran to a nearby house and leapt onto its low, flat roof.
Then he and Abu sprinted from rooftop to rooftop.
landing on a pair of clotheslines and finally falling into a soft pile of clothes.
Instantly he was snatched up by a pair of thick, hairy hands.
It was Rasoul, the head of the sultan's guard.
Rasoul was a man of few words, but if there was one thing he did well, it was catching young thieves.
''Gotcha!" Rasoul said, lifting Aladdin up.
Abu leapt onto Rasoul's shoulder and shoved the guard's turban over his eyes.
Aladdin quickly wrenched himself free, and he and Abu bolted away.
They wove through the marketplace, past a camel salesman, a rug merchant, a jewelry cart.
Suddenly Abu stopped.
The little monkey's eyes were fixed on the cart.
Abu had one big weakness—sparkling jewels.
He crouched beside the cart, reaching up to steal a pendant.
"Stop him!" someone yelled.
Dozens of faces turned toward Abu.
Aladdin spun around. He grabbed Abu by the back of his neck.
To their right, the guards charged closer.
To their left, angry townspeople closed in.
Aladdin and Abu ran straight ahead toward a stairway that led to a tall tower.
They raced up the stairs and in through a window.
Aladdin grabbed a rug, and using it as a parachute, he and Abu leapt from another window to the other
side of the building.
They jumped again, this time landing safely in a quiet little alley, darkened by the shadow of the sultan's
palace doors.
There the sounds of the marketplace were muffled.
Aladdin exhaled and sat down. He was starving.
"All right, Abu, now we feast!" he said, breaking the loaf of bread in half.
But before he could eat, he saw a frail boy and girl in the shadows.
They said nothing, but their wide, staring eyes spoke for them.
Aladdin could tell they hadn't eaten in days.
He looked at the bread. He had risked his life to get it—and his mouth was watering like crazy. But he
couldn't let them go hungry.
With a sigh, he held his half out to the children.
"Go on, take it," he said softly.
Abu scowled, but he handed over his piece, too. The girl smiled.
She took Abu's bread and gave his fur a gentle stroke.
Abu liked that. People didn't usually treat him so nicely.
He tipped his hat and strutted away proudly— and smacked right into Aladdin's legs.
But Aladdin didn't even notice. His eyes were focused on something straight ahead.
"Wow...," Aladdin muttered.
The marketplace had fallen silent.
Right through the middle rode a man on a horse. He wore robes of the finest silk, studded with jewels.
As the people cleared the way and bowed, the man thrust his chin proudly in the air.
Aladdin wandered out of the alley and into the crowd. Everyone was murmuring about the rich-looking
man.
"That's Prince Achmed," a woman said, "on his way to the palace."
"Just another suitor for the princess," an old man said, shaking his head.
"He'll ask to marry her, and she'll throw him out—just like all the others."
Aladdin stared in awe. If the princess could reject someone like that, she must be a pretty amazing girl!
Aladdin felt a tug on his leg. Abu was pulling him toward the crowd. Aladdin could see a group of poor
children clustering too close to Prince Achmed's horse.
Suddenly the horse bucked, frightening the children, and the prince shouted, "Out of my way, you filthy
brats!"
Angered, Aladdin broke through the crowd and strutted right up to Prince Achmed.
"if I were as rich as you" he yelled, "I could afford some manners!"
"Out of my way, you flea-bitten street rat!" Prince Achmed kicked his horse and brushed past Aladdin,
knocking him down into the mud.
Burning with anger, Aladdin leapt to his feet and started to run after the prince's horse.
"I'm not worthless! I'm not a street rat!" he shouted.
He ran all the way to the palace doors. With a loud clang,
they slammed shut in his face. "And I don't have fleas!" he shouted at the closed doors.
Prince Achmed never even turned around. Aladdin bowed his head sadly and slumped back into town. As
a chilly darkness settled over Agrabah that night, Aladdin and Abu climbed to the roof of a crumbling old
building. There were only a few mats and a couple of worn-out pillows, but to Aladdin and Abu, this was
home. Abu curled up on a pillow and closed his eyes. With a smile, Aladdin covered him with a soft mat.
"Someday, Abu, things are going to be different," he said. "We'll be dressed in robes instead of rags. And
we'll be inside a palace, looking out—instead of outside looking in"
In the distance, the sultan's palace loomed majestically.
"That'd be the life, huh, Abu? To be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all"
With a sigh, Aladdin lay down to sleep.
CHAPTER THREE
"Meeeooow!"
The scream came from the palace menagerie. It echoed into the throne room, where the sultan covered
his ears.
Whack! The door slammed against the throne room wall In stomped
an angry Prince Achmed.
'I've never been so insulted!" he shouted.
"Good luck marrying her off!"
"But ... but ... " the sultan sputtered.
The prince marched right by him and out the other door—revealing a big hole in the seat of his pants.
"Jasmine!" the sultan bellowed.
He was a roly-poly old man, happy and kind, and loved by his subjects. Only one person could get him
upset—his daughter.
Princess Jasmine. He loved her dearly, but she was so ... stubborn. All he wanted her to do was marry a
prince. Every princess did it.
But Jasmine? No. No one was good enough for her! He waddled into the palace menagerie. The sound of
water was all around, flowing down marble waterways, spouting into pools from hand-carved fountains.
It was the most beautiful place in all Agrabah.
But the sultan noticed none of that now. "Jasmine!" he called again.
"Rrrrrrr...," came a soft growl.
There was a flash of orange and black. The sultan found himself face-to-face with a tiger, its teeth
clamped on to the missing piece of Prince Achmed's pants.
"Confound it. Rajah!" the sultan said, grabbing the ripped material.
Rajah slinked away to the back of the garden, where the sultan's daughter sat at the edge of a fountain.
"Oh, Father, Rajah was just playing," she said, gently stroking the tiger. "You were just playing with that
overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you?" she said to Rajah.
Jasmine was more than beautiful. Princes from miles around risked their life crossing the desert to see
her. Each vowed to conquer the world for her love.
But as for Jasmine—well, she'd had enough of halfwitted princes and bragging noblemen. If only one of
them would show a little
intelligence ... some kindness and honesty and a sense of humor wouldn't hurt, either.
The sultan shook his head. "Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor. The law says you must be
married to a prince by your next birthday. You have only three more days."
"The law is wrong!" Jasmine replied.
"Father, I hate being forced to marry. If I do marry, I want it to be for love."
"It's not just the law," the sultan said gently. He hesitated for a minute before continuing. "Im not going
to be around forever, and I just want to make sure you're taken care of."
"But I've never done anything on my own! I've never had any real
friends—except you. Rajah," Jasmine said, giving her tiger a pat on
the head. "I've never even been outside the palace walls!"
"But Jasmine, you're a princess!" cried the sultan.
"Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore!"
"Oooooo!" The sultan threw up his hands and stomped back into the
throne room.
A shadow appeared behind him. It was the tall, thin shadow of a man
in a pointed turban, with a parrot on his shoulder. In his right hand
was a long staff with a snake head carved at the top.
The sultan turned around.
"Ah Jafar, my most trusted adviser!" he said. "I am in desperate need of your wisdom".
"My life is but to serve you," said Jafar with a tight, thin-lipped smile.
"Jasmine refuses to choose a husband," the sultan said. "I am at my wit's end!"
"Awk! Wit's end!" lago squawked.
The sultan reached into a china bowl and took out a cracker. "Have a cracker. Pretty Polly?" he said.
If there was one thing lago hated, it was eating crackers. Especially the dry, stale ones the sultan had. He
practically gagged as the sultan stuffed the crackers into his beak.
"Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals," Jafar remarked. "Now then, I may be able to find
a solution to your problem, but it would require the use of the Blue Diamond."
The sultan backed away. He clutched at the ring on his finger. "My ring has been in the family for
years—" he protested.
Jafar held his staff in front of the sultan's eyes. The eyes of the snake head began to glow. "It's necessary
to find the princess a suitor, isn't it?" Jafar said, moving closer, ''Don't worry ... everything will be fine."
The sultan could not stop staring at the snake head. His willpower was draining away.
"Everything will be fine," he droned as he slipped the ring off his finger and gave it to Jafar.
Jafar smiled. "You are most gracious, my sire," Jafar said. "Now run along and play with your toys,
hmmml"
"Yes ...," the sultan said dreamily, waddling away.
Jafar turned and left the throne room. As he hurried down a marble corridor, lago began spitting out the
crackers.
"I can't take it anymore! If I have to choke down one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers, I'll grab
him by the neck and—"
"Calm yourself, lago," said Jafar. "This Blue Diamond will reveal to us the Diamond in the Rough— the
one who can enter the cave and
bring us the lamp."
At the end of the corridor, Jafar entered his private quarters. "Soon will be sultan, not that jumbo
portion of stupidity!"
"And then," lago crowed, "I stuff crackers down his throat!"
At the other end of the dark room, Jafar pushed open a secret door, revealing a spiral staircase. He
began climbing the stairs that led to his private laboratory. In every comer
of the room, potions bubbled in glass beakers. There was a huge cauldron in the back and an enormous
hourglass on an old table.
Jafar walked toward the hourglass, holding the Blue Diamond. "Now, lago, we go to work."
Early the next morning. Jasmine crept to the palace wall. Rajah followed close by, his shoulders slumped
in sadness.
"I'm sorry. Rajah," Jasmine said, "but I can't stay here and have my life lived for me."
Tears welled up inside her. It was hard enough running away from her father. But having to look into
Rajah's eyes made it more painful
than she could have imagined. She had to make her move now, otherwise she might change her
mind. Stepping onto Rajah's back. Jasmine quickly climbed the
garden wall. Pausing at the top, she said, "I'll miss you. Rajah. Qoodbye."
Then she disappeared over the side, into the land of her subjects—a
land she had never visited before.
CHAPTER FOUR
Breakfast is served, Abu!" said Aladdin as he cracked open a
ripe, juicy melon. Perched on an awning, the two friends had a
perfect view of the bustling marketplace below. All around them,
merchants announced their wares. "Buy a pot—brass and silver!" called one.
"Sugared dates and figs!" shouted another as he strolled by a crowd of people watching a fire breather.
"Pistachio nuts! Let the fire
breather roast them for you!"
"Fresh fish!" cried a third vendor. Aladdin watched as the man waved a large fish high in the air, almost
smacking it into the face of a young
girl who was covered with a thin cloak. She staggered backward, bumping right into the fire breather. He
belched a long plume of fire.
"Oh!" the startled girl cried out. "Excuse me. I'm sorry!"
Aladdin stopped eating. He couldn't help staring.
Maybe it was her eyes, so deep and kind. Or her hair, like a waterfall made of the blackest silk. Or her
perfect skin, or her...
Aladdin blushed. He never thought of girls that way. But this one— well, this one was different. Special
somehow. Aladdin watched her
as she made her way through the market. Jasmine spotted a ragged little boy standing in a daze in front
of a
mound of ripe fruit. "You must be hungry," she said, taking an apple from the cart. "Here you go."
The child beamed. Clutching the apple, he ran away.
"You'd better pay for that!" the vendor said.
"Pay?" Jasmine looked puzzled. She had never paid for anything in
her life. "I'm sorry, sir, I don't have any money, but I'm sure I can get
some from the sultan—"
"Thief!" The seller grabbed her arm. With his other hand, he pulled
out a shiny knife. "Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?"
Suddenly Aladdin darted between them and grabbed the vendor's
arm. "Thank you, kind sir, I'm so glad you found my sister!" he said.
Turning to Jasmine, he scolded, "I've been looking all over for you!"
Jasmine
was about to protest when Aladdin whispered, "Just play along..."
The seller pulled Aladdin aside and said, "You know this girl? She
said she knew the sultan!"
"She's my sister," Aladdin replied. Then, lowering his voice, he said,
"Sadly, she's a little crazy. She thinks the monkey is the sultan."
Quickly Jasmine began bowing to Abu. "O Wise Sultan," she said.
"How may I serve you?"
People in the crowd began to laugh. Aladdin helped Jasmine up and
said, "Now come along. Sis. Time to see the doctor."
As the seller stared at Aladdin and Jasmine, Abu snatched apples off
the cart and stuffed them into his vest.
Jasmine stopped in front of a camel and said, "Hello, Doctor, how
are you?"
"No, no, not that one," Aladdin said. "Come on. Sis." He called over
his shoulder, "Come on. Sultan!"
Abu followed after them. He puffed out his chest, imitating the
sultan—and three apples tumbled out of his vest.
The seller turned red with fury. "Come back here, you little thieves!"
he shrieked.
But it was too late. The three of them broke into a run and
disappeared into the crowd.
At the palace, Jafar chuckled with evil glee, lago was frantically
turning a wheel that was attached to a generator. Electricity spurted
from the generator into a bubbling cauldron. Slowly a shimmering
blue cloud formed in the air.
The Blue Diamond was encased in a frame above an enormous
hourglass. Jafar swept his arm in front of it, chanting, 'Part, sands of time! Reveal to me the one who can
enter the cave!"
He flipped the hourglass over. Then, with a loud cmack! a bolt of
lightning shot from the cloud. It struck the diamond, which exploded
into a pulsing blue light.
The sand in the hourglass began to glow and swirl. Slowly an image
began to form—an image of Aladdin running through the
marketplace.
'That's the clown we've been waiting for?" lago blurted out.
"Yes, a ragged little urchin. How perfect—he'll never be missed!"
Jafar looked at lago with a twisted grin. "Let's have the guards extend
him an invitation to the palace, shall we?"
Aladdin, Abu, and Jasmine jumped from rooftop to rooftop in the
marketplace. Aladdin could tell Jasmine had never been to that part
of Agrabah before. But he had to admit one thing—when it came to
roof hopping, she was a fast learner.
When Aladdin and Abu finally reached their home. Jasmine looked
around and said, "Is this where you live?"
"Yep, just me and Abu," Aladdin replied. "It's not much, but it has a
great view." He pointed toward the palace. "Amazing, huh? I wonder
what it would be like to live there and have servants and valets—"
Jasmine sighed. "And people who tell you where to go and how to
dress."
"That's better than here," Aladdin replied. "Always scraping for food
and ducking guards—"
"Never being free to make your own choices," Jasmine said. "Always
feeling—"
"Trapped," they said at the same time. Their eyes met, and they
smiled. Aladdin blushed, then quickly took an apple from Abu and
tossed it to Jasmine. "So where are you from?" he asked, changing
the subject.
"What does it matter?" Jasmine answered. "I ran
away, and I'm not going back. My father is forcing me to get
married".
'That's awful!" Aladdin said.
Jasmine's eyes met his again. Suddenly Aladdin couldn't speak,
couldn't even move. Strange feelings raced around inside him,
feelings so strong they made him dizzy.
Who was this mysterious girl?
Aladdin could hear Abu chattering wildly, but he didn't listen. All he
could see, all he could hear, was Jasmine.
"Here you are!" a voice roared.
Aladdin snapped out of his trance. Below them stood a group of the
sultan's guards, swords drawn.
"They're after me!" Aladdin and Jasmine said together. They
stopped, looking at each other in confusion, then spoke again at the
same time: "They're after you?"
But there was no time to figure things out. Aladdin looked over the
opposite side of the roof. There was a pile of hay below. "Do you trust
me?" he asked Jasmine, pulling her close. Their eyes locked again.
"Well... yes," she replied.
"Then jump!"
Aladdin, Jasmine, and Abu leapt off the roof. They
landed safely in the hay and quickly got to their feet. Aladdin spun
around, ready to sprint for his life.
But it was too late. Rasoul loomed over him, smirking. "We just keep
running into each other, eh, street rat? It's the dungeon for you,
boy!"
Jasmine stepped in Rasoul's path. "Let him go!"
"Look, a street mouse!" Rasoul snarled. With a laugh, he pushed
Jasmine to the ground.
Jasmine sprang to her feet. Anger flashed in her eyes. Regally
drawing back her hood, she said in a firm, commanding voice,
"Unhand him, by order of the princess!"
"The princess?" Aladdin repeated.
The guards froze in shock. "Princess Jasmine?" Rasoul said. "What—
what are you doing outside the palace?"
"Just do as I command," Jasmine said. "Release him."
"I would, Princess," Rasoul replied, "except my orders come from
Jafar. You'll have to take it up with him."
And with a sheepish shrug, he dragged Aladdin away.
"Believe me, I will!" Jasmine exclaimed.
Back at the palace. Jasmine stormed into jafar's chamber. There he
was, looking as sneaky and sinister as always.
"Princess" he said, "how may I be of service?"
Princess Jasmine looked him sharply in the eye. "Jafar, the guards
just took a boy from the market—on your orders!"
"Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah," Jafar said. "The boy was a criminal. He
tried to kidnap you."
"He didn't kidnap me!" Jasmine replied. "I ran away!"
Jafar's brow creased with concern. "Oh dear, how frightfully upsetting. Had I but known ..." His voice
trailed off.
"What do you mean?" Jasmine asked.
"Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out."
Jasmine shuddered. "What sentence?"
Jafar sighed. He put a hand on Jasmine's shoulder. "Death," Jafar
said softly. "By beheading."
A gasp caught in Jasmine's throat. "How... how could you?"
She turned and ran out, not stopping until she reached the
menagerie.
Rajah bounded happily toward her, but Jasmine ran
right by him. She collapsed by a fountain, tears running down her
cheek.
"Do you trust me!" the boy had asked her. Yes, she had. This boy was
so different from the others—funny, kind, friendly....
And now he was dead. Because of a stupid mistake.
"Oh, Rajah," she said. 'This is all my fault. I didn't even know his
name."
Jasmine buried her head in Rajah's fur and wept.
CHAPTER FIVE
The palace dungeon was cold, dark, and dirty. Not even the
sultan had ever entered it. All prisoners were brought there by
Jafar—and not one had escaped.
Aladdin was determined to be the first. He grunted loudly, struggling
at his chains, but they held fast to the stone wall.
Jafar had lied to Jasmine. Aladdin was alive—but not for long, if
everything went according to Jafar's plan.
Aladdin collapsed to the floor with a sigh. "She was the princess," he
said to himself. "I can't believe it!"
Just then a shadow appeared on the wall—the shadow of a small
monkey poised between the bars of the prison window. "Abu!"
Aladdin cried, spinning around. "Down here!"
Abu hopped down. He frowned at Aladdin and chattered angrily as
he did an imitation of a pretty girl walking.
Aladdin knew he was being scolded for paying too
much attention to Jasmine. "Hey, she was in trouble" he said, "i'll
never see her again, anyway. I'm a street rat, remember! Besides,
there's some law that says she's got to marry a prince." He exhaled
with frustration. "She deserves a prince."
Abu pulled a small pick out of his vest pocket and unlocked Aladdin's
cuffs. Grinning with triumph, he pulled Aladdin toward the window.
But Aladdin just slumped to the floor. He was still thinking of
Jasmine. "I'm a fool," he said.
"You're only a fool if you give up," came a crackly voice.
Aladdin turned to see an old snaggletoothed man hobble out of the
shadows. His white beard hung to the floor, and he had a hump on
his back. He looked as though he had been in the dungeon for years.
"Who are you!" Aladdin asked.
"I am a lowly prisoner like yourself—but together, perhaps we can be
more. I know of a cave filled with treasures beyond your wildest
dreams." The man shuffled closer, smiling. "There's treasure enough
to impress your princess, I'd wager."
Abu's eyes lit up at the mention of treasure. He tugged at Aladdin's
vest.
Neither of them saw lago peek out of the old man's hump and
whisper, "Jafar, could you hurry up! I'm dying in here!"
Aladdin gave the prisoner a forlorn look. "But the law says she has to
marry—"
Jafar cut Aladdin off. He raised a bony finger and spoke once again
in an old man's voice. "You've heard of the Golden Rule! Whoever
has the gold makes the rules!"
"Why would you share this treasure with me?" Aladdin asked.
"I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it." Jafar
walked to the dungeon wall and pushed one of the stones. Slowly an
entire section of wall opened, revealing a hidden stairway. "So, do we
have a deal?"
Aladdin was hesitant, but he shook the old man's hand.
Jafar cackled with excitement. "We're off!"
It was dark by the time they reached the Cave of Wonders. Jafar took
out the scarab pieces and fit them together once again.
Aladdin stared in awe as the pieces flew into the sandstone and the
massive tiger-god arose.
"Who disturbs my slumber?" the intimidating voice boomed. Jafar
motioned for Aladdin to go closer.
Abu jumped into Aladdin's vest. Aladdin tried to keep from
trembling. "Uh, it is I... Aladdin."
A tunnel of harsh light shot from the tiger-god's mouth. Aladdin had
to turn away. "Proceed," the voice continued. "Touch nothing but the
lamp."
"Quickly, my boy," Jafar urged in his old man's voice, "Fetch the
lamp, and then you shall have your reward!"
Cautiously Aladdin stepped inside the tiger-god's mouth. Through
the blinding light, he saw a long stairway leading downward. At the
bottom there were mountains of gold. Cascades of gold. Coins,
jewels, plates, bowls, goblets, chests, all piled together as far as he
could see.
Abu was practically hypnotized by the sight of all that gold and went
straight for an enormous treasure chest.
"Abu!" Aladdin warned. "Don't touch anything! We have to find that
lamp."
Abu grumbled, but turned from the chest and followed his master through the cave—until he sensed a
strange
movement behind him. He spun around to look.
Nothing—just a purple carpet with gold tassels, lying on the floor.
Abu turned and ran toward Aladdin.
This time something tapped Abu on the shoulder, then snatched his
hat. Abu spun around again.
It was the carpet, walking along behind him.
"Eeeeeeeeeee!" Abu shrieked, jumping on Aladdin for protection.
In fright, the carpet quickly ran behind a large pile of coins.
"Cut it out, Abu!" Aladdin said.
Abu jabbered away, pointing to the large mound. Aladdin turned and
saw a tassel stick out, then quickly pull itself in.
Aladdin moved closer for a better look. He could see the carpet
moving away from him. "A magic carpet!" he said. Then he called,
"Come on out, we're not going to hurt you."
Using its two lower tassels as legs and its upper ones as hands, the
carpet slowly emerged and handed Aladdin Abu's hat. Aladdin's
mouth hung open in disbelief.
Abu snatched the hat and began scolding the carpet.
The carpet slowly walked away, drooped over in shame. "Hey, wait a
minute, don't go!" Aladdin said. "Maybe you can help us find this
lamp...."
The carpet whirled around and began pointing excitedly. Aladdin
grinned. "I think he knows where it is!"
Rising off the ground, the carpet began to fly. Aladdin and Abu
followed it into another cavern.
Aladdin stopped in his tracks. This cavern made the other one look
like a waiting room. It stretched upward so high Aladdin couldn't see
the ceiling. The walls were a cool blue, unlike any color he had ever
seen in the desert. A lagoon of aqua blue water stretched from wall to
wall.
In the center of the lake stood a tower of solid rock with only a series
of stepping stones leading to it. On top, lit by a magical beam of light,
was a small object.
It was too far away to see, but Aladdin knew that it must be the lamp.
His heart began to race. It wouldn't be easy to get to the top. First he
would have to hopscotch across the rocks, then he would have to
climb the steep, jagged tower of rock.
"Wait here," he said to Abu and the carpet. "And remember, don't
touch anything."
Springing from stone to stone, Aladdin arrived at the base of the
tower. With a sudden groan, the sloping rock transformed into a
staircase.
Aladdin smiled. Someone— something —was on his side. He raced
upward, two steps at a time.
At the top, the lamp came into clear view.
It was dusty and dented and cheaper looking than the worst used
lamp he had ever seen in the marketplace.
Aladdin picked it up. "This is it?" he said to himself. "This is what we
came all the way here for?"
Out of the comer of his eye, he spotted Abu and the carpet. They
were in front of a large golden statue that looked like a giant monkey
idol. Its arms were outstretched, and in its cupped palms it held an
enormous red jewel.
And Abu was reaching right for it.
"Abu!" Aladdin shouted. "No!"
But it was too late. Abu had the jewel in his hands.
The ground began to rumble instantly. Rocks and dust fell from
above. The voice of the tiger-god echoed like a cannon: "Infidels! You
have touched the forbidden treasures! Now you shall never again see
the light of day!"
The jewel began to melt in Abu's hand. Panicked, he put it back into
the palms of the statue.
But the damage was already done. The stairway beneath Aladdin
transformed into a long chute, and his feet gave way.
With a last-minute lunge, Aladdin grabbed the lamp. Tumbling down
the chute, he saw the lagoon become a pool of boiling lava. He closed
his eyes, bracing himself for the end.
Whoosh! He stopped in midair. Something was pushing him upward.
His eyes sprang open.
The carpet had caught him, and it was whisking him away!
The cavern shook violently. Aladdin held tightly to the carpet. It
dodged right and left as large rocks fell from the ceiling. Aladdin
looked down, searching for Abu.
"Eeeeee!" came a cry from below. There he was, hopping across the
stepping-stones and screeching. Over his head, a boulder hurtled
toward him.
With a burst of speed, the carpet streaked down. Aladdin plucked
Abu away from danger, then flew toward the cavern entrance. The
ground below erupted as the
piles of dazzling treasures burst into flames. Aladdin and Abu looked
down in horror. The coins and jewels were melting!
The carpet raced to the stairway, charred by a wave of lava. They
could see the starry night sky through the entrance above. Just a few
more feet...
Thunk! A jagged piece of rock fell onto the carpet, pinning it to the
ground.
Aladdin and Abu tumbled onto the stairs.
Aladdin looked down at the carpet in dismay. There was no way he
could save it. It would be hard enough to save himself.
He looked up. He could see the opening at the top— freedom. Abu
scaled the steps and hopped outside.
Aladdin followed as fast as he could, but the stairs began to shake.
He lost his footing.
Springing to his feet, he lunged for the top step. His fingers clutched
on to it—just as the entire stairway buckled beneath him.
Aladdin dangled over the collapsing cave. "Help me!" he cried. "I
can't hold on!"
Still dressed as the beggar, Jafar peeked over the edge. "First give me
the lamp!"
There was no time to argue. Aladdin held it out.
Jafar's eyes gleamed as he grabbed the lamp and stuffed it into his
robe. "At last!" he shrieked in triumph. Leering at Aladdin, he pulled
out a dagger.
"What are you doing?" Aladdin cried.
"Giving you your reward!" Jafar replied. "Your eternal reward."
Abu leapt at Jafar, biting him hard on the arm.
"Yeeeeaggggh!" Jafar screamed. He fought hard, but Abu held tight.
Finally Jafar dropped the dagger. With a furious gesture, he flung
Abu into the cave.
Aladdin's fingers could hold on no longer. He let go.
The walls of the cavern raced by him as he and Abu fell head over
heels.
CHAPTER Six
Aladdin awoke on the cave floor. The fire was out, the lava gone, only the steady drip of water echoed
throughout the cave.
On top of him lay the carpet and Abu.
Aladdin groaned and sat up. The carpet fell off, and Abu began to
stir. Above him, Aladdin could see no opening, only the solid ceiling
of the cavern.
"We're trapped," he said. "That two-faced son of a jackal! He's long
gone with that lamp."
Abu jumped up. Something bulged in his vest—a jewel, Aladdin
figured. Like a magician, Abu waved his arms, reached into his vest,
and pulled out the hidden object.
Aladdin blinked and shook his head. It was the lamp!
"Why, you little thief," Aladdin said with a smile. He took the beatup lamp and studied it carefully.
"There's something written on it,
but it's hard to make out."
Aladdin rubbed the faded words with his sleeve. It
was almost impossible to get the grime off. He rubbed harder and
harder—then suddenly stopped.
The lamp was glowing!
Aladdin gasped. Abu and the carpet backed away.
Then ... Poooof! Colorful smoke erupted from the lamp's spout. It
whirled crazily, growing into a blue cloud, slowly forming into a
shape—an enormous flowing shape with arms, a chest, a head, and a
wild-eyed face with a long, black, curling beard.
'Ten thousand years will give you such a crick in the neck!" the blue
creature said.
Aladdin and Abu watched as he then grabbed his own head and
twisted it all the way around. ''Wow, does that feel good!" he said.
"Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi! What's your name?"
"Uh ... Aladdin."
"Hello, Aladdin! Can I call you Al? Or maybe just Din. Or how about
Laddie? 'Here, boy! Come on. Laddie!' " He whistled and pretended
to call a dog. Then, in another puff of blue smoke, he became a giant
dog.
His eyes wide, Aladdin turned to the carpet. "I must have hit my
head harder than I thought."
The creature changed back to his original form. "Say, you're a lot
smaller than my last master!" he said.
"Wait a minute, " Aladdin said. "I'm your master?"
'That's right! And I am your genie, direct from the lamp! Right here
for your wish fulfillment! Three wishes, to be exact—and ixnay on the
wishing for more wishes! Three, that's it! No substitutions,
exchanges, or refunds!"
"Three wishes?" Aladdin said. "Any three I want?"
"Uh, almost," the genie replied. "There are a few limitations. Rule
number one—I can't kill anybody, so don't ask. Rule number two—I
can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else. Rule number three
—I can't bring people back from the dead. Other than that, you got
it!"
Aladdin liked this genie. He decided to tease him a little.
"Limitations?" He sighed. "Some all-powerful genie. I don't know,
Abu, he probably can't even get us out of this cave."
The genie put his hands on his hips. "Excuse me? You don't believe
me?" Jumping onto the carpet, he scooped up Aladdin and Abu in his
mammoth hands. "You're getting your wishes, so sit down, and we
are out of here!"
He put them down, then swung his arm overhead. A thunderous
boom resounded above them, and a crack
opened in the cavern's ceiling. Rocks and sand fell aside, and early
morning light poured in.
The carpet began to rise. It spiraled upward, picking up speed.
Aladdin held tight as the genie reared back and let loose a laugh that
shook the walls.
Aladdin couldn't keep from laughing himself. The desert air never
smelted so good.
He was free.
And he still had his three wishes left.
CHAPTER SEVEN
Jafar, this is an outrage!" the sultan yelled, pacing in the throne
room, "From now on, you're to discuss sentencing of prisoners
with me— before they are beheaded!"
Princess Jasmine scowled at Jafar as he bowed his head. On his
shoulder, even lago looked sorry. "My humblest apologies to both of
you," Jafar said.
"At least some good will come of my being forced to marry," Jasmine
said. "When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of
you, Jafar!" With that, she stalked out to the menagerie.
"Jasmine!" the sultan called, running after her.
Jafar watched them leave. His sad, sorrowful look began to
disappear. All his rage and frustration bubbled up. "If only I had
gotten that lamp," he muttered through clenched teeth.
'To think we've got to keep kissing up to that chump and his chump
daughter the rest of our lives," lago said.
"Until she finds a chump husband," Jafar remarked. "Then she'll
have us banished—or beheaded!"
"Wait a minute, Jafar!" lago said. "What if you marry the princess?
Then you become the sultan, right?"
Jafar walked slowly to the throne and sat down. It felt wonderful!
"Hmmmm," he said. 'The idea has merit "
"Yeah!" lago squawked. "And then we drop papa-in-law and the little
woman off a cliff— ker-splat!"
Jafar burst out laughing. "I love the way your foul little mind works!"
In a desert oasis just outside Agrabah, the carpet swooped down to
the sand. The genie turned to Aladdin with a proud grin. "Well, how
about that, huh? Do you doubt me now?"
"Nope," Aladdin said. "Now, about my three wishes..."
'Three?" the genie said. "You are down by one, boy!"
Aladdin smiled mischievously. "I never actually wished to get out of
the cave. You did that on your own!"
The genie thought for a moment. "All right, " he said with a laugh.
'You win. But no more freebies!"
Aladdin hopped off the carpet and began pacing around. "Hmm ...
three wishes ... What would you wish for?"
"Me? No one's ever asked me that before." The genie thought it over
for a moment. "Well, in my case ... freedom."
"You mean, you're a prisoner?" Aladdin asked.
"That's what being a genie's all about." The genie shrugged.
"Phenomenal cosmic powers, itty-bitty living space."
The carpet, Abu, and Aladdin peered inside the small lamp. "Genie,
that's terrible," Aladdin said.
'To be free, to be my own master—that would be greater than all the
magic and all the treasures in the world." The genie sighed. "But the
only way I can get out is for my master to wish me out, so you can
guess how often that's happened."
Aladdin thought about this for a moment. "I'll do it," he finally said.
"I'll set you free."
'Yeah, right," the genie said, rolling his eyes.
"No, I'm not lying," Aladdin said. "I promise—after
my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free."
"Okay, here's hoping!" said the genie. "Now, what is it you want?"
"Well," Aladdin said, "there's this girl—"
"Wrong! I can't make anyone fall in love, remember?"
"But Genie, she's smart and fun and beautiful."
Aladdin shrugged and looked at the ground. "But she's the princess.
To even have a chance, I'd have to be—"
That was it! The answer was right in front of him! "Hey!" Aladdin
said. "Can you make me... a prince?"
The genie raised an eyebrow. "Is that an official wish? Say the magic
words "
"Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!" Aladdin blurted.
"All right!" The genie began circling around Aladdin. "Now, first we
have to get rid of the fez-and-vest combo." With a sweeping gesture,
he conjured up a robe of fine silk and a turban with a dazzling jewel
and shining gold trim. "Ooh, I like it!"
"Wow!" Aladdin could hardly believe how... princely he looked. No
one would dare call him "street rat" now. He picked up the lamp and
hid it under his turban. No decent prince would dare be seen with
such a piece of junk.
"Hmmm, you'll need some transportation...." The genie looked at
Abu. "Uh, excuse me! Monkey boy!"
Abu shot away, trying to hide. But it was no use. With a snap of his
fingers, the genie turned him into a camel. "Hmmm ... not good
enough," the genie said, snapping his fingers again. This time Abu
appeared as
a magnificent stallion. "Still not enough " With a
decisive snap, Abu was transformed again, this time into an
elephant. "What better way to make your entrance down the streets
of Agrabah than riding your very own elephant! Talk about trunk
space!"
Aladdin could do nothing but stare, dumbfounded. The genie was on
a roll. He gestured wildly, laughing at the top of his lungs. "Hang on
to your turban, kid!" he shouted. "We're going to make you a star!"
CHAPTER EIGHT
Jafar rushed into the throne room, holding a large scroll. "Sire,"
he called to the sultan, "I have found a solution to the problem
with your daughter!"
"Awk!" squawked lago. "Problem with your daugh-ter!"
"It's right here." Jafar unfurled the scroll and began reading: " 'If a
princess has not chosen a husband by her sixteenth birthday, then
the sultan shall choose for her!"
The sultan nodded. "But Jasmine hated all those suitors. How can I
choose someone she might hate?"
"Not to worry, there is more," Jafar said, unrolling the scroll further.
" 'In the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess may be
wed to—' Hmmm, interesting ..."
"What?" the sultan demanded. "Who?"
" The royal vizier.' " Jafar looked up. "Why, that's me!"
"But I thought the law says only a prince can marry a princess," the
sultan said, reaching for the scroll
Jafar quickly set it on a table and picked up his staff. "Desperate
times call for desperate measures, my lord."
The snake head began to glow with hypnotic light. "Yes," the sultan
said, his eyes glazing over. "Desperate times..."
"You will order the princess to marry me," Jafar said confidently.
"I will order the princess to—"
Ra-ta'ta'taaaaaah! The sound of trumpets blared in through the
window. The sultan blinked and turned toward the noise. "Wha—
what! I heard something!"
Instantly the spell was broken. The sultan rushed to the window and
looked out. Muttering, Jafar followed.
A huge band was marching down the main street. A giant peacock
float moved slowly behind; lions and bears in colorful painted cages
rolled by. People filled the streets to see the grand procession
approaching.
"Make way for Prince Ali Ababwa!" the bandleader sang. Behind him
strode a majestic elephant, its trunk held proudly in the air. On its
back, a canopy bounced up and down.
From the canopy, Aladdin grinned and waved. The crowd roared
with admiration. Dancers whirled around him, swordsmen marched
in perfect step, and dozens of attendants walked alongside. Abu
lumbered on proudly, and the carpet made a perfect cushion for
Aladdin on Abu's bumpy back.
The genie floated among the crowd, changing himself every few
minutes into a drum major, a harem girl, an old man, a child. In each
disguise, he told everyone what a splendid prince was approaching.
By the time Aladdin got to the palace gates, he was the talk of
Agrabah. His entire entourage—Abu, swordsmen, brass band,
dancers, and all—marched right into the throne room.
As the sultan and Jafar stared, Aladdin slid off Abu's back and onto
the carpet. "Your Majesty," Aladdin said, bowing in front of the
sultan, "I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand."
"Prince Ali Ababwa!" the sultan said with a bright smile. "I'm
delighted to meet you. This is my royal vizier, Jafar."
Jafar did not look delighted at all. "I'm afraid. Prince Abooboo—"
"Ababwa" Aladdin corrected him.
"Whatever," Jafar said. "You cannot just parade in here uninvited
and—"
"What a remarkable device!" the sultan exclaimed, looking at the
carpet. "May I try?"
"Why, certainly. Your Majesty!" Aladdin said. He helped the sultan
onto the carpet. It took off, flying the sultan around the room.
As the old man hooted with delight, Jafar eyed Aladdin suspiciously.
"Just where did you say you were from?"
Before Aladdin could answer, the carpet swooped down and let the
sultan off. "Well, this is a very impressive youth, and a prince,
besides!" Lowering his voice, the sultan said to Jafar, "If we're lucky,
you won't have to marry Jasmine after all!"
"I don't trust him—" Jafar said.
The sultan ignored him. "nonsense, jafar. Jasmine will like this one."
"And I'm sure I'll like Princess Jasmine," Aladdin said.
"Your Highness!" Jafar blurted. "On Jasmine's behalf, I must say—"
"Just let her meet me," Aladdin interrupted. "I will win your
daughter."
None of them had seen Jasmine enter from the menagerie, with
Rajah behind her. "How dare you!" she said. "Standing around,
deciding my future. I am not a prize to be won!" With that, she
turned and stormed out.
Aladdin's heart sank. He was sure she'd like him as a prince. He
never thought this would happen.
"Don't worry. Prince Ali," the sultan said. "Just give her time to cool
down. She'll warm to you."
Aladdin and the sultan walked into the menagerie. Jafar watched
them silently, then turned to lago. "I think it's time to say bye-bye to
Prince Abooboo...."
CHAPTER NINE
For the rest of the day, Aladdin waited in the
menagerie. Jasmine's room was overhead, but she refused to
come to her balcony.
As night fell, Aladdin began to give up hope. "What am I going to
do?" he moaned. "I should have known I couldn't pull off this stupid
prince act."
Abu looked at his master and swung his trunk in sympathy.
"All right," the genie said, looking up from a game of chess with the
carpet. "Here's the deal. If you want to court her, you have to tell her
the truth. Just be yourself!"
"No way!" Aladdin said. "If Jasmine found out I was really some
crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me." He looked up at Jasmine's
balcony and drew himself up straight. "I'm going to go see her," he
said. "I've got to be smooth. Cool. Confident."
The genie sighed. He knew Aladdin was in for trouble.
The carpet slid beneath Aladdin, lifting him up to Jasmine's balcony.
Through her window, Aladdin could see her playing with Rajah.
"Princess Jasmine?" he called out.
Jasmine turned and walked to the window. "Who's there?"
"It's me," said Aladdin. Then, remembering his Prince Ali voice, he
added, "Prince Ali Ababwa."
"I do not want to see you!" Jasmine snapped.
As she turned back into the room, Aladdin stepped off the carpet and
onto the balcony. "Please, Princess, give me a chance!"
Rajah leapt into his path. Aladdin jerked away, almost losing his
turban.
Jasmine narrowed her eyes. "Wait. Do I know you? You remind me
of someone I met in the marketplace."
Aladdin backed into the shadows. 'The marketplace? Why, I have
servants who go to the marketplace for me! So it couldn't have been
me you met."
"No, I guess not," Jasmine said, looking disappointed.
A bee buzzed by Aladdin's ear. He moved to swat it until he heard it
speak—in the genie's voice! "Enough about you," he said. 'Talk about
her."
"Princess Jasmine, you're—uh, beautiful." Aladdin said.
"Rich, too," she said. "And the daughter of the sultan."
Aladdin smiled. "I know."
"A fine prize for any prince to marry," she said, playing along.
"Right! A prince like me!"
"Right! A prince like you!" Jasmine repeated. "And every other
swaggering peacock I've met. Go jump off a balcony!"
Jasmine turned and strode into her chamber.
"Mayday! Mayday!" the genie said, still disguised as a bee. "Stop her!
Want me to sting her?"
"Buzz off!" Aladdin replied.
"Okay," the genie said. "But remember— bee yourself!"
"Yeah, right," Aladdin muttered as the genie flew under his turban
and into the lamp.
Jasmine looked over her shoulder. "What?"
"Uh ... I said, you're right!" Aladdin sighed. "You ... aren't just some
prize to be won. You should be free to make your own choice."
Dejected, Aladdin turned away. He climbed over the railing and
stepped off the balcony into space.
"No!" Jasmine cried. But Aladdin didn't fall—he was hovering in
midair.
"How are you doing that?" Jasmine said, stunned.
"It's, uh, a magic carpet," Aladdin said.
Jasmine looked over the railing and touched the carpet. "It's lovely."
"You don't want to go for a ride ... do you?" Aladdin gave her a
hopeful look. "We could fly away and see the world...."
"Is it safe?" Jasmine asked.
"Sure." Aladdin held out his hand and smiled. "Do you trust me?"
Do you trust me? Jasmine had heard those exact words before, said
in the same way. "Yes," she said softly, taking his hand.
She stepped onto the carpet, and it took off. Losing her balance, she
fell into Aladdin's arms. He blushed, but he liked the feeling—and he
could tell Jasmine did, too.
The carpet soared over the palace. Agrabah stretched out below
them, a cluster of twinkling lights. And above
them, the stars of the desert sky winked a thousand times as they
glided over the sands. In the distance, the sea seemed to be made of
the blackest ink.
Swooping among the pyramids, Aladdin and Jasmine whooped with
joy. When the carpet flew through an apple orchard, Aladdin
reached way out and grabbed an apple for the princess.
He flipped it to her with a lopsided smile. The casual flip, the smile;
Do you trust me? —all of it was exactly like the boy in the
marketplace. Was it possible?
She decided to find out. The carpet finally set them down on the roof
of a tall pagoda, and they watched a fireworks display in the distance.
"It's all so... magical," Jasmine said. "It's a shame Abu had to miss
this."
"Nah," Aladdin said. "He hates fireworks. He doesn't really like to fly
—"
Aladdin caught himself in midsentence.
"It is you! "Jasmine blurted. "Why did you lie to me! Did you think I
wouldn't figure it out?"
"No! I mean, I hoped you wouldn't—that's not what I meant—"
Aladdin groped for words. His stomach churned. He couldn't let
Jasmine know the truth. "Um ... the truth is, I sometimes dress as a
commoner, to escape the pressures of palace life. Yeah. But I really am Prince Ali
Ababwa!"
Jasmine looked unsure. "Why didn't you just tell me?"
"Well, you know... royalty going into the city in disguise ... sounds a
little strange, don't you think?"
Perfect! He knew he had her now. After all, she had been in disguise
when he met her.
"Not that strange," she said, resting her chin on Aladdin's shoulder.
Together they watched the fireworks until they were too tired to keep
their eyes open. The carpet then flew them back to the palace,
hovering outside Jasmine's window.
Jasmine stepped onto the balcony, then turned toward Aladdin. They
smiled at each other over the railing— until the carpet gave Aladdin a
gentle nudge forward.
His lips suddenly met hers. She didn't move a bit. In the soft light of
the stars, they shared a long kiss.
"Good night, my handsome prince," she said, backing into her
chamber.
"Sleep well, Princess," Aladdin replied.
As she disappeared behind a curtain, Aladdin
grinned. "For the first time in my life," he murmured dreamily as the
carpet floated down to the garden, "things are starting to go right."
He snapped back to reality when he felt the hard grip of rough hands
on his shoulder. Turning around, Aladdin came face-to-face with
RasouL
Before Aladdin could move, another guard slapped manacles on his
wrists and ankles. Rasoul stuffed a gag in his throat.
"Abu!" Aladdin tried to yell through the gag. "Abu, help!"
He looked around wildly until he spotted Abu— hanging from a tree,
tied up with thick rope. The carpet tried to fly away, but another
guard threw it into a cage.
Jafar emerged from the shadows. On his shoulder, lago was grinning.
"I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo," Jafar
hissed.
Aladdin whirled around. He struggled with his chains. If only he
could reach his turban. The lamp was underneath—and the genie
was inside the lamp.
Jafar looked calmly at the guards. "Make sure he is never found."
CHAPTER TEN
In the chill of the desert night, the guards rushed Aladdin to the
sea by camel, And without a word, they pushed him over a cliff.
Aladdin plunged into the water with a loud splash. In the dim
moonlight, he could see his turban floating away. The lamp slowly
emerged, then dropped to the seafloor.
He kicked his legs, desperate to reach the lamp. He groped with his
hands.... There—he had it. But his strength was leaving him. He tried
to rub the lamp, but he was weak ... so weak ...
Sploosh! The genie materialized, wearing a shower cap and holding a
scrub brush. "Never fails," he said. "You get in the bath, and there's a
rub at the lamp. Hello?"
Instantly his smile disappeared. Aladdin was limp.
"Al! Kid! Snap out of it!" the genie pleaded, grabbing Aladdin. "I
can't help you unless you make a wish. You
have to say, 'Genie, I want you to save my life!' Got it?''
Aladdin's head bobbed ever so slightly.
"I'll take that as a yes!" The genie let go of Aladdin and swam in a
circle. A whirlpool formed, spinning Aladdin upward.
He burst through the surface, coughing and flailing. Before he could
fall, the genie scooped him up and flew away. "Don't scare me like
that!" the genie scolded.
Aladdin looked around with excitement. He was alive—wet and
humiliated, but alive. As they flew back toward Agrabah, Aladdin
looked into the smiling face of his rescuer.
"Genie, I ... Thanks" was all he could say.
Jasmine had never been happier. She couldn't stop humming, and
she couldn't stop thinking about Aladdin.
As she unbraided her hair in the bedroom mirror, she didn't notice
her father walk in, with Jafar behind him. "Jasmine ...," the sultan
began.
She turned around. "Oh, Father! I just had the most wonderful time.
I'm so happy!"
The sultan stared straight ahead. "You should be, Jasmine" he said in a dull voice. "I have chosen a
husband for you.
You will marry Jafar."
Jasmine gasped.
Jafar stepped forward. The snake head of his staff glowed brightly,
working its hypnotic spell on the sultan.
"Never!"Jasmine said. "Father, I choose Prince Ali!"
Jafar laughed. "Prince Ali left, like all the others. But don't worry.
Wherever he went, I'm sure he made quite a splash."
"Better check your crystal ball, Jafar!" came a voice from the
window.
Jafar turned, lago squawked in surprise. It was Aladdin!
Jasmine ran to him. "Prince Ali!" she cried. "Are you all right?"
"Yes," Aladdin said, "but no thanks to Jafar. He tried to have me
killed!"
"Your Highness," Jafar said, "he's obviously lying."
"Obviously ... lying ...," the sultan repeated mechanically.
"Papa, what's wrong with you?" Jasmine said with dismay.
Aladdin leapt across the room toward Jafar. "I know
what's wrong!" He pried the staff loose from Jafar and smashed the
snake head on the floor.
"Oh! Oh my ..." the sultan said, shaking his head. "I feel so strange."
"Your Highness," Aladdin said, holding the broken staff in the air.
"Jafar's been controlling you wath this!"
The sultan's eyes narrowed. "Jafarl You—you traitor! Guards! Arrest
Jafar at once!"
But Jafar had caught sight of something he hadn't noticed before—
peeking out of Aladdin's turban was the magic lamp! He lunged for
it, but the sultan's guards seized him.
"This is not done yet, boy!" Jafar said. Reaching into his robe, he
pulled out a magic pellet and threw it on the floor. In a puff of smoke,
he and lago were gone.
"Find him!" the sultan yelled to his guards. "I can't believe it! Jafar,
my trusted counselor, plotting against me!"
His shocked expression changed to a smile when he turned back to
Jasmine and Aladdin. "Can it be? My daughter has finally chosen a
suitor?"
Jasmine nodded, and the sultan threw his arms around Aladdin.
"Oh, you brilliant boy! You two will be wed
at once! You'll be happy, prosperous—and then you, my boy, will
become sultan!''
SultanI Aladdin swallowed nervously. This was supposed to be the
happiest moment of his life, but he was suddenly veiy worried.
lago flew around Jafar's lab in a blind panic. "We've got to get out of
here!" he said. "I've got to pack!"
But Jafar was deep in thought. He burst out with a sudden laugh and
gripped lago by the throat. "Prince All is nothing more than that
ragged urchin Aladdin!" he said. "He has the lamp, lago!"
lago's eyes narrowed. "Why, that little, cheating—"
"But you are going to relieve him of it!" Jafar said with a sinister grin.
"Listen closely."
lago leaned in as Jafar whispered his master plan.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Aladdin was given the most comfortable suite in the palace, but he
barely slept that night. By dawn he was pacing back and forth,
holding his turban, the lamp inside. Abu and the carpet sat outside
by the window, watching him with concern.
"Huzzah!" the genie cried, popping out of the lamp. "Aladdin, you've
just won the heart of the princess! What are you going to do next?''
He lowered his voice to a whisper. "Psst. Your next line is, ' I'm going
to free the genie'!"
"Genie," Aladdin said sadly, "I'm sorry, but I can't. They want to
make me sultan—no, they want to make Prince Ali sultan. The only
reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you! What if
they find out the truth? What if Jasmine finds out? She'll hate me."
Aladdin looked into the genie's pale, disappointed face. "Genie, I
need you. Without you, I'm just Aladdin."
The genie tried to control his anger. "I understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else. Hey, I was beginning to feel
left out. Now, if you'll excuse me...."
With that, he disappeared into the lamp.
"Genie," Aladdin called out, "I'm really sorry."
The genie's lips stuck out of the spout and razzed him.
"Fine!" Aladdin snapped, throwing a pillow over the lamp. 'Then just
stay in there!" As he stomped away, he could see Abu and the carpet
watching him from the window. "What are you guys looking at?"
As Abu and the carpet turned away. Jasmine's voice came from the
menagerie. "Ali? Will you please come here? Hurry!"
"Coming, Jasmine!" Aladdin called out the window.
He rushed outside. As he ran to the menagerie in the direction of
Jasmine's voice, he passed a group of flamingos in a pond.
At least they all looked like flamingos.
lago snickered to himself. His imitation of Jasmine had worked—and
his flamingo disguise was perfect, thanks to Jafar's magic. When
Aladdin was gone, he hurried into the empty room and quickly stole
the lamp. Hooking it with his beak, he flew outside and straight back
to Jafar's lab.
"AH! There you are." said Jasmine. "I've been looking all over for
you!"
Aladdin turned around, puzzled. Abu and the carpet scampered to
his side Jasmine was running toward him. But how could she have
been "looking all over" when she had just—
"Hurry," she said, taking him by the hand. "Father's about to make
the wedding announcement."
They climbed the stairs of a tower that overlooked the courtyard.
Townspeople clogged every square inch trying desperately to see the
royal couple. Jasmine stepped onto the platform and took her place
next to her father. Smiling, the sultan announced to the crowd:
"Ladies and gentlemen, my daughter has chosen a suitor— Prince Ali
Ababwa!"
CHAPTER TWELVE
In another tower that overlooked the palace
courtyard, Jafar and lago watched as Aladdin was about to
step before the roaring crowd.
"Look at them cheering that little pip-squeak!" cried lago.
"Let them cheer," Jafar said as he held the lamp tightly and began to
rub it. "At last," he said. "The power is mine!"
In a puff of smoke, the genie appeared. "Al, if you're going to
apologize, I—' The genie's jaw dropped when he saw Jafar.
"I am your master now!" Jafar said.
"I was afraid of that—"
"Keep quiet!" snapped Jafar. "And now, slave, grant me my first
wish. I wish to be sultan!"
As Aladdin stared down from the platform, the crowd suddenly
became hazy. Clouds swirled over the palace, and with a loud tearing
sound, the canopy over the
platform was ripped off. Jasmine and Aladdin looked around in
confusion as a strange magical light engulfed the sultan. And when it
stopped, the sultan was on the floor—in his underwear! The crowd
gasped.
There was someone else on the stand now—someone tall, dark, and
dressed in the sultan's robes. He held a snake staff in his right hand.
"Jafar!" Aladdin exclaimed.
Jafar turned with a sneer. "Sultan jafar to you!"
"What manner of trickery is this?" the sultan demanded.
"Finders keepers," Jafar said. "I have the ultimate power now!"
A shadow fell over the courtyard. Everyone looked up.
Aladdin's breath caught in his throat. Abu and the carpet clutched
each other in terror. Looming over them like an evil giant was the
genie. He placed his hands on the palace as if he were about to crush
it.
"Genie, stop!" Aladdin shouted. "What are you doing?"
The genie's eyes were full of sadness. "Sorry, kid," he said. "I've got a
new master now."
With a mighty heave, he lifted the entire palace off
the ground. The people of Agrabah scattered, screaming as debris fell
around them. The genie then flew to a mountain high above the city
and set the palace down there.
Jafar let out a deep, triumphant laugh. "Now, you miserable
wretches—bow to me!"
"We will never bow to you!" Jasmine replied. Aladdin and the sultan
stood by her.
'Then you will cower! "Jafar said. He whirled around to face the
genie. "My second wish is to be the most powerful sorcerer in the
world!"
His snake staff began to glow, and green lightning crackled around it.
Rajah let out a roar and lunged at Jafar. Jafar waved his staff, and in
midair. Rajah was transformed into a kitten. As Rajah landed softly
on his paws, Jafar glared at Jasmine and Aladdin. "Take a look at
your precious Prince Ali—or should we say, Alad-din!"
A bolt of light shot from the staff. It surrounded Aladdin and Abu.
Instantly Abu became a monkey again. Aladdin's robe, slippers, and
turban disappeared. He fell to the floor, dressed in his old rags. "He's
nothing more than a worthless lying street rat!"
Jasmine looked at him, confused and hurt. "Ali!"
"Face it, boy, you don't belong here," Jafar said.
"uh, where does he belong? Could it be ... the ends of the earth?" lago
taunted.
"Works for me!" Jafar cried as he waved his staff again.
Aladdin and Abu suddenly levitated off the ground and into the open
window of a narrow tower. In an instant, the tower rocketed over the
horizon. The carpet sped after it.
Jasmine watched in horror as the tower vanished over the horizon.
The genie sadly turned away.
With a devious laugh, Jafar shouted, "At last! Agra-bah is mine!"

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
When Aladdin awoke, he was cold—freezing cold. As he
made his way out of a snowbank, an icy wind whipped snow into
his face.
Where was he? Through the raging blizzard, he could see the tower
lying in pieces, half-covered with snow. Just beyond it, a cliff plunged
downward into darkness.
A crash ... that was all he remembered. He must have been thrown
out of the tower, unconscious.
A brown lump caught his attention. "Abu!" he called through
chattering teeth. He raced over and dug his pet out of the snow. "Are
you all right?"
Shivering, Abu nodded weakly.
Aladdin tucked Abu into his vest. "Oh, Abu, this is all my fault. I
should have freed the genie when I had the chance. Somehow, I've
got to go back and set things straight."
He felt a tickling sensation on his leg. Spinning
around, he saw the carpet reaching toward him. It was caught
beneath a huge chunk of the tower.
Aladdin tried to pull the carpet free, but it was stuck tight. He and
Abu started digging a trench around it, but the tower began to teeter.
"Look out!" Aladdin shouted. The tower began rolling toward them.
Calculating quickly, Aladdin ducked, curling Abu into his arms. The
tower rolled over them, right where there was a window opening.
Unharmed, they watched as the tower plunged over the cliff.
Freed from the tower, the carpet scooped up Aladdin and Abu and
flew above the clouds.
"All right," cried Aladdin. "Now, back to Agra-bah!"
Jafar loved the view from his new throne room. The palace was
where it belonged now —on a mountaintop, not in the midst of the
rabble. He happily sipped from his wine glass while the genie
massaged his feet. The former sultan was now suspended from the
ceiling like a marionette. He was dressed in a jester's outfit, and Jafar
and lago snickered at the ridiculous sight. Rajah, still a kitten, paced
anxiously in a cage.
Jasmine sat at the window, her wrists in shackles, her eyes filled with
sadness.
Jafar reached out with his staff. He hooked her shackles and pulled
her close. "It pains me to see you reduced to this. Jasmine. You
should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world." With a
wave of his staff, he made her chains vanish. A crown appeared on
her head. "Why, with you as my queen—"
Jasmine took his glass and threw the wine in his face. "Never!"
Jafar bolted up from the throne. 'Temper, temper. Jasmine," scolded
Jafar. "You know what happens
when you misbehave. I'll teach you some respect!"
He glared at the genie. "Genie, I have decided to make my final wish
—I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me!"
"No!" Jasmine said, backing away.
"Uh, Master," the genie said, "I can't do that—"
"You will do what I order you to do, slave!" Jafar roared as he
grabbed the genie's beard.
Nobody noticed Aladdin and Abu peeking into the throne room
window behind them—nobody except Jasmine.
She was about to scream when Aladdin shushed her
with a finger over his mouth. He, Abu, and the carpet climbed
silently into the room.
Jasmine thought fast. "Jafar," she said with a seductive smile, "I
never realized how incredibly handsome you are!"
Jafar spun around. His jaw hung open in disbelief— and so did the
genie's.
"That's better," Jafar said. He slinked toward jasmine, a cocky smile
on his face. "Now, tell me more about... myself."
"You're tall, dark ..." Jasmine could see Aladdin, Abu, and the carpet
sneaking toward the lamp. Now the genie saw them, too. He was
trying to stifle an excited giggle.
"Go on ...," Jafar said.
Abu was inches from lago now—and lago was turning around.
Jasmine quickly put her arms around Jafar, locking him in place.
"You're well dressed," she continued. "You've stolen my heart "
With a quick leap, Abu grabbed lago off his perch and put a hand
over his mouth. They both tumbled to the ground.
"And the street rat?" Jafar said, drawing closer to Jasmine.
"What street rat?'' Jasmine asked,
Crasssshhh! Abu and lago knocked into a table, sending a pot to the
ground.
Jafar started to turn. Jasmine had no choice but to pull him close
and kiss him—passionately and on the lips.
Now was Aladdin's chance for action. But he couldn't move. All he
could do was stare. There she was, the girl for whom he had risked
his life, kissing ... him,
Jafar pulled back. He was dazed with joy—until he saw the reflection
of Aladdin in Jasmine's crown.
"You!" he said, whirling around in blind rage. His arm snapped
forward, pointing his staff at Aladdin.
Zzzzzzzap! A flash of light struck Aladdin in the chest. He flew
backward, crashing into a pile of jewels.
"How many times do I have to kill you, boy!" Jafar said, drawing his
arm back for a second shot.
Jamsine leapt at him, pushing his arm aside.
"You deceiving shrew!" Jafar snarled. "Your time is up!"
He turned his staff on Jasmine. Instantly she was trapped inside a
giant hourglass. The upper chamber was full of sand, and it slowly
spilled through the opening
onto her. There was more than enough to bury her alive.
Zzzzzap! With a stroke of the staff, Jafar turned Abu into a cymbal clanking toy monkey.
Zzzzzap! The carpet began to unravel. Aladdin ran to stop it. Jafar
called out, 'Things are unraveling fast, boy.'
"This is all your fault, street rat! You never should have come back!"
Zzzzzzap! Aladdin jumped back. A sword clattered to the ground
beside him, then another. He looked up. Dozens of razor-sharp
swords fell from the ceiling.
Jafar gestured again, and a wall of fire burst from the floor.
Aladdin grabbed one of the fallen swords. "Are you afraid to fight me
yourself, you cowardly snake?" Aladdin said, batting away the swords
as they fell.
Jafar made his way toward Aladdin, forcing him closer to the fire.
"A snake, am I? Perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike I can be!"
Jafar held out his snake staff with both hands. It began to grow,
coming to hideous life, wrapping Jafar himself into its skin. Swelling,
hissing, Jafar became a monstrous
cobra, his head rising toward the ceiling. The flames rose with him,
becoming a ring of deadly coils surrounding Aladdin.
With an unearthly roar, Jafar lunged. Aladdin swung his sword.
Shink! He struck two of Jafar's fangs, which clattered onto the floor.
"Rickum-rackum, stick that sword into that snake," the genie
shouted.
"You stay out of this!" Jafar hissed. He lunged again, knocking
Aladdin to the floor. The sword flew out of his hand.
"Ali!" the sultan cried, watching helplessly from above. "Jasmine!"
Aladdin rolled away, catching a glimpse of the hourglass. The sand
had risen swiftly, covering all but Jasmine's head.
Without his sword, there was only one chance. Aladdin ran for the
window and leapt onto the balcony. Jafar slithered after him. Quickly
Aladdin ran back in, then ducked out another window.
Jafar followed from window to window, tangling his long body into a
knot. He shrieked with pain.
Aladdin picked up his sword and ran toward the hourglass.
Jasmine's nose was barely above the sand, her eyes wide with fear.
Aladdin drew back the sword, ready to smash the glass.
With a resounding boom, Jafar pulled down the wall. He was free—
and he threw his coils around Aladdin.
Aladdin's sword was caught in midair. He struggled to get loose.
"You thought you could outwit the most powerful being on earth!"
Jafar bellowed.
Aladdin wrenched left and right. In a comer of the room, the genie
watched helplessly.
The genie!
Thinking fast, Aladdin said, "You're not so powerful. The genie has
more power than you'll ever have! He gave you your power, and he
can take it away!"
The genie ducked behind a pillar. "Al, what are you doing? Why are
you bringing me into this?"
"Face it, Jafar, you're still just second," Aladdin continued.
Jafar loosened his coils. He turned his slimy face to the genie.
"You're right. His power does exceed my own—but not for long!"
Aladdin fell to the floor as Jafar slithered across the
room. "Slave!" Jafar called to the genie. " I'm ready to make my third
wish. I wish to be—an all-powerful genie!"
The genie looked at Aladdin, his blue face now chalk white. "Your
wish," he said in a small, wavering voice, "is my command!"
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The genie gestured. A swirling current of energy encircled
Jafar, and he began to change shape. The fire disappeared. His
cobra body became wider and wider until he took on the roundness
of a genie. "Yes!" Jafar shrieked. 'The power! The absolute power!"
Quickly Aladdin picked up his sword and smashed the hourglass.
Jasmine slid forward with the cascading sand. "What have you
done?" she asked as Aladdin pulled her free.
Aladdin smiled. 'Trust me."
"The universe is an open book before me!" Jafar yelled. "Mine to
command, to control!" The dome of the palace exploded as Jafar rose
to the sky.
Before he could say another word, gold shackles clamped around his
wrists—just like the ones the genie wore. A lamp began to materialize
beneath him, new and shiny.
"Whaaat? What is happening?" Jafar demanded.
"You wanted to be a genie?" Aladdin picked up the new lamp and
held it out to Jafar. "You got it—and everything that goes with it!"
Jafar's legs were now a trail of vapor, a trail that disappeared into the
lamp's spout. "No!" he said, his eyes bugging out in terror.
"Nooooooo!"
Screaming with anguish, Jafar reached his hand upward. His fingers
clasped lago's feet. "Wha—hey! Let go!" lago screamed.
With a dull thoomp! Jafar and lago were sucked into the lamp.
Everyone in the throne room fell into an awed silence. Jasmine, the
sultan, and the genie stared at Aladdin.
"Phenomenal cosmic powers," Aladdin said with a shrug. "Itty-bitty
living space!"
The genie let out a loud cackle. "Al, you little genius!"
Instantly the room began to return to normal. Back on his feet, the
sultan sighed with pleasure as his robes materialized on him. Abu
became a live monkey again. Rajah grew back into a tiger, breaking
free of his small cage. And the carpet looked brand new.
The genie grabbed the lamp and went to the balcony.
"Shall we? Ten thousand years in the Cave of Wonders ought to chill
him out!" He wound up and hurled the lamp, sending it end over end
toward the desert.
Smiling proudly, the genie flew outside. He grew to a gigantic shape,
picked up the entire palace, and began carrying it back to its rightful
place.
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Later that day, when Agrabah had returned to
normal. Jasmine and Aladdin stood on the throne room
balcony.
"Jasmine," Aladdin said softly, "I'm sorry I lied to you ... about being
a prince."
Jasmine nodded. "I know why you did."
"I guess ... this is good-bye?"
Jasmine turned away. "That stupid law! It isn't fair!" Slowly,
tearfully, she faced Aladdin again. "I love you."
Suddenly the genie popped through the window. "Al, no problem—
you've got one wish left Just say the word, and you're a prince again!"
"But Genie," Aladdin said. "What about your freedom?"
"Al, you're in love. You're not going to find another girl like this in a
million years. Believe me, I've looked."
Aladdin looked from the genie to Jasmine. He knew how much
freedom meant now. Not only to the genie but to Jasmine—and to
himself. Just as she needed to
be free of the sultan's laws, Aladdin needed to be free, too. Free to be
himself.
"Jasmine ... I do love you," he finally said. "But I can't pretend to be
something I'm not."
Jasmine bowed her head. "I understand."
"Genie," Aladdin said, "I wish for your freedom. It's about time I
started keeping my promises."
In a flash, the genie's gold cuffs vanished. He was stunned. "Quick!
Wish for something—anything! Say, 'I want the Nile!'"
"Er—I wish for the Nile," Aladdin said.
"NO WAY!" said the genie, with a laugh. "I'm free!" he shouted, his
face lighting up. "I'm free! I'm off to see the world!"
"Congratulations!" the sultan said, peeking out behind him.
"Qenie, I'm going to miss you," Aladdin said.
"Me, too, Al," the genie replied with a fond smile. "No matter what
anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me!"
"That's right!" the sultan agreed.
"You've certainly proved your worth as far as I'm concerned. If it's the law that's the problem, then what
we need is a new law!"
Jasmine looked at him, stunned. "Father!"
"From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy!"
"I choose you, Aladdin!" Jasmine cried instantly.
Aladdin was ecstatic. "Call me Al," he said.
He and Jasmine burst out laughing.
Aladdin took her in his arms, and the two of them began twirling around the balcony.
"Well!" the genie said with a huge smile, "i can't do any more damage around here.
And now I am out of here!
Bye-bye, you crazy lovebirds!"
Like a rocket, the genie launched himself into the sky.
The sultan followed him with his eyes until the genie disappeared over the horizon.
Aladdin and Jasmine didn't even notice him leave.
As they shared a long, dreamy kiss, they didn't notice much of anything—except each other.


ALADDIN:  THE COMPLETE SCRIPT

PEDDLER:    Oh I come from a land
    From a faraway place
    Where the caravan camels roam
    Where they cut off your ear /Where it's flat and immense
    If they don't like your face /And the heat is intense
    It's barbaric, but hey--it's home!
    When the wind's at your back
    And the sun's from the west
    And the sand in the glass is right
    Come on down,
    Stop on by
    Hop a carpet and fly
    To another Arabian night!

    Arabian nights
    Like Arabian days
    More often than not
    Are hotter than hot
    In a lot of good ways

    Arabian nights
    'Neath Arabian moons
    A fool off his guard
    Could fall and fall hard
    Out there on the dunes.

    Ah, Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend.
    Please, please, come closer--(Camera zooms in hitting
    peddler in face) Too close, a little too close.  (Camera
    zooms back out to CU)There.Welcome to Agrabah.  City of
    mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this
    side of the river Jordan, on sale today, come on down!
    Heh, heh.  Look at this! Yes!  Combination hookah and
    coffee maker--also makes Julienne fries.  Will not break
    (taps it on table), will not--(it falls apart)--it
    broke.  Ooohhh!  Look at this! Pulls out Tupperware) I
    have never seen one of these intact before.  This is the
    famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.  (Pries it open,
    makes raspberry sound.)  Ah, still good. (Camera begins
    to pan to right.  PEDDLER hurries to catch it.)  Wait,
    don't go!  (Stop pan.)I can see that you're only
    interested in the exceptionally rare.  I think then, you
    would be most rewarded to consider...this.  (PEDDLER
    pulls the MAGIC LAMP out from his sleeve.) Do not be
    fooled by its commonplace appearance.  Like so many
    things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside
    that counts.  (Another pan, this one slower to left.
    Again, PEDDLER rushes to catch up.)  This is no ordinary
    lamp!  It once changed the course of a young man's life.
    A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he
    seemed.  A diamond in the rough.  Perhaps you would like
    to hear the tale?  (PEDDLER pours shiny sand from the
    lamp into his hand.)  It begins on a dark night (PEDDLER
    throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry
    nightscape.) , where a dark man waits, with a dark
    purpose.

(Camera tilts down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
    on his shoulder.  GAZEEM comes riding up to the pair.)

JAFAR:  You...are late.
GAZEEM:A thousand apologies, O patient one.
JAFAR:  You have it, then?
GAZEEM:I had to slit a few throats to get it.  (Pulls out
        half of the medallion.  JAFAR reaches out for it,
        but GAZEEM yanks it back.)  Ah, ah, ahhh!  The treasure!
        (IAGO squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion.)  Ouch!
JAFAR:  Trust me, my pungent friend.  You'll get what's
        coming to you.
IAGO:   What's coming to you!  Awk!

(JAFAR pulls out the second half of the medallion.  He connects
    them, and the insect medallion begins to glow.  Finally, it
    flies out of JAFAR's hand, scaring the horses, and is off
    towards the dunes.)

JAFAR:  Quickly, follow the trail!

(All ride off, following the glowing speck of light, until
    it reaches a large dune.  It separates into two and the
    halves plunge into the dune.  All that remains are two glowing
    points of light on the dune.  But then the dune begins to rise
     up, transforming into a giant lion's head, with the glowing
    points serving as the eyes.)

JAFAR:  At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave
        of wonders!
IAGO:       Awk!  Cave of wonders!
GAZEEM: By Allah!
JAFAR:  Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.  The rest of the
        treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!

(GAZEEM starts to approach the lion's mouth, which forms the
    entrance to the cave.  He chuckles as he goes.)

IAGO:   Awk, the lamp!  Awk,  the lamp!  (Now that IAGO and
    JAFAR are alone, IAGO opens up in normal English.)
    Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?

(JAFAR puts his finger to his lips and shushes him.  GAZEEM reaches
    the cave, but is blown away by the roar of the cave's speaking.)

CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?
GAZEEM: It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
CAVE:       Know this.  Only one may enter here.  One whose
        worth lies far within.  A diamond in the rough.

(GAZEEM turns to JAFAR with a questioning look.)

JAFAR:  What are you waiting for?  Go on!

(GAZEEM hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave.  With
    great apprehension, he plants his foot down.  Nothing happens.
      Relieved, he begins his trek again.  Then another roar comes.
     He turns back, but the lion's mouth slams shut and the dune
    collapses back to normal.  All that are left are JAFAR, IAGO,
     and the two separated halves of the medallion.)

CAVE:       Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough.

(IAGO unburied himself from the sand, coughing as he does so.)

IAGO:       I can't believe it.  I just don't believe it. We're
        never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp!  Just
        forget it.  Look at this.  Look at this.  I'm so
        ticked off that I'm molting!  (He flies up to
        JAFAR's shoulder.)
JAFAR:  Patience, Iago.  Patience.  Gazeem was obviously
        less than worthy.
IAGO:       (Extremely sarcastically) Oh, there's a big
        surprise.  That's an incred--I think I'm gonna have
        a heart attack and die from not surprise!  What're
        we gonna do?  We got a big problem here,a big prob-
        (JAFAR pinches his beak shut.)
JAFAR:  Yes, we do.  Only one may enter.  I must find this
        one, this...diamond in the rough.

(Cut to a rooftop, where ALADDIN rushes up to the edge, carrying
    a loaf of bread.  He almost drops it over the edge.)

GUARD:  Stop, thief!  I'll have your hands for a trophy,
        street rat!
ALADDIN:    (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.)  All
        this for a loaf of bread?

(He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with
    drying clothes on them.  He skies down them, collecting bits
    and pieces of clothing on him as he goes.  Finally, he's
    nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches
     out and slams the shutters closed.  ALADDIN slams into the
    shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by
    numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him.  He pulls
     off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread
    when...)

GUARD 1:    There he is!
GUARD 2:    You won't get away so easy!
ALADDIN:    You think that was easy?

(He looks at three women, laughing at him.)

GUARD 1:    You two, over that way, and you, with me.  We'll
        find him.

(ALADDIN pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise.
    He rushes over to the women.)

ALADDIN:    Morning, ladies.
WOMAN 1:    Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't
        we Aladdin?
ALADDIN:    Trouble?  No way.  You're only in trouble if you
        get caught--

(A hand grabs ALADDIN's shoulder and yanks him back.  It's the
    first GUARD.  ALADDIN's disguise falls off.)

ALADDIN:    I'm in trouble!
GUARD:  ...and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU,
        then the guard's turban is pulled down over his
        eyes.  ABU dances on the GUARD's head, laughing.)
ALADDIN:    Perfect timing, Abu!
ABU:        Hello!
ALADDIN:    Come on, let's get outta here!
        Gotta keep...one jump ahead of the breadline
        One swing ahead of the sword
        I steal only what I can't afford
        That's everything!

(ALADDIN battles a GUARD wielding a sword.  He dodges a couple of
    swings, then pulls down the GUARD's pants.  ABU raspberries the
    GUARD, then dodges an attack.  The GUARD swings at ALADDIN,
    but destroys a barrel of fish.  As ALADDIN runs off, the GUARD
     pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants.)

        One jump ahead of the lawmen
        That's all, and that's no joke
        These guys don't appreciate I'm broke!

(ALADDIN and ABU scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down
    on top of another GUARD.)

GUARDS: (one at a time) Riffraff! Street rat!
        Scoundrel! Take that!
ALADDIN:    Just a little snack, guys!

(ALADDIN scampers to the top of a platform. The GUARDS shake the
    platform back and fro trying to knock him off.)

GUARDS: Rip him open, take it back guys!
ALADDIN:    I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
        You're my only friend, Abu!
WOMEN:  Who?!?

(ALADDIN jumps off the platform to certain death, only to grab ABU's
    hands like an acrobat.  The pair swing into a harem.)

        Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom
        He's become a one-man rise in crime

(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a
    chipmunk.)

WOMAN:  I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em!
ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
        Tell you all about it when I got the time!

(ALADDIN and ABU exit.  Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd.  The
    GUARDS rush past.  Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind the MUSCLEMAN,
     matching his moves, until they make a mistake and are discovered.)

        One jump ahead of the slowpokes
        One skip ahead of my doom
        Next time gonna use a nom de plume.
        One jump ahead of the hitmen
        One hit ahead of the flock
        I think I'll take a stroll around the block.

(A chase sequence, in which ALADDIN and ABU, pursued by the GUARDS,
    race through a flock of sheep, hurdle a MAN sleeping on a bed of
    nails {of course one extremely large GUARD lands on him}.  ABU
     disguises himself with jewels until a SHOPKEEPER discovers him.

CROWD:  Stop, thief! Vandal!
        Outrage! Scandal!
ALADDIN:    Let's not be too hasty

(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens
    and a large, ugly LADY comes out.)

LADY:   Still I think he's rather tasty

(ALADDIN tumbles away, then puts his arm around a GUARD, acting
    like they're all chums.)

ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
        Otherwise we'd get along!
GUARDS: WRONG!

(They all jump into a pile and fight.  When they stop, ALADDIN and
    ABU are gone.  They are sneaking away in barrels.  They run
    across a flaming pit, followed by GUARDS who hop up and down,
    screaming in pain as they cross the rocks.  ALADDIN and ABU
    pass a SWORD SWALLOWER, then ABU goes back, pulls the sword
    out of the SWALLOWER's mouth.  ABU advances on the guards,
    who retreat in fear.)

GUARD 1:    He's got a sword!
GUARD 2:    You idiot--we've ALL got swords!!

(ABU sets the sword down gently, then runs.  ALADDIN and ABU are
    once again surrounded, with GUARDS coming from left and right.
      He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street,
     as the GUARDS all crash into each other.)

ALADDIN:    One jump ahead of the hoofbeats!
CROWD:  Vandal!
ALADDIN:    One hop ahead of the hump!
CROWD:  Street rat!
ALADDIN:    One trick ahead of disaster
CROWD:  Scoundrel!
ALADDIN:    They're quick--but I'm much faster
CROWD:  Take that!

(The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room.  He grabs a
     carpet and jumps out the window)

ALADDIN:    Here goes, better throw my hand in
        Wish me happy landin'
        All I gotta do is jump!

(The GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down to
     the street, and land in a pile with the sign "Crazy Hakim's
    Discount Fertilizer."  ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
    to land safely and out of danger. ALADDIN and ABU high-five each
    other.)

ALADDIN:    And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right!

(ALADDIN breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU, who begins
    to eat.  But ALADDIN looks over and sees two young children
    rummaging through the garbage for food.  The GIRL sees him, then
    drops her find and tries to hide.  ALADDIN looks at them, then
    the bread, then at ABU.)

ABU:        Uh-oh!

(ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks
    over to the children.  The GIRL pulls her brother back.)

ALADDIN:    Here, go on--take it.

(The children giggle with delight.  ABU tries to swallow his bite,
    then looks guilty. He walks over to the children and offers his
     bread to them.  In delight, they pet him on the head.)

ABU:        Ah, don't.  Huh?

(ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade
    going on.ALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people.  He sees
    PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse.)

BYSTANDER 1:    On his way to the palace, I suppose.
BYSTANDER 2:    Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is startled as the two children come running out from the
    alley. The BOY runs out in front of the PRINCE's horse,
    startling it.)

PRINCE: Out of my way, you filthy brat!

(The PRINCE brings up his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN
    jumps in front of them and catches the whip.)

ALADDIN:    Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners
PRINCE: Oh--I teach you some manners!

(The PRINCE kicks ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laugh at him.)

ALADDIN:    Look at that, Abu.  It's not every day you see a
        horse with two rear ends!

(The PRINCE stops and turns back to ALADDIN.)

PRINCE: You are a worthless street rat.  You were born a
        street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only
        your fleas will mourn you.

(ALADDIN rushes the PRINCE, but the doors to the castle slam shut
    in his face.)

ALADDIN:    I'm not worthless.  And I don't have fleas.  Come
        on, Abu.  Let's go home.

(ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in
    ABU for the night.)

ALADDIN:    Riffraff, street rat.
        I don't buy that.
        If only they'd look closer
        Would they see a poor boy?  No siree.
        They'd find out, there's so much more to me.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace.)

        Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.  We'll be
        rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems
        at all.

(Dissolve to same shot during day.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber.
     The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, missing the
    rear end of his pants.)

PRINCE: I've never been so insulted!

SULTAN: Oh, Prince Achmed.  You're not leaving so soon, are
        you?

PRINCE: Good luck marrying her off!

SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine!  Jasmine!  Jasmine!  (The SULTAN goes
        off into the garden looking for his daughter.  He
        finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE's
        pet tiger, who blocks him off.  RAJAH has a piece
        of the PRINCE's undershorts in his mouth.The SULTAN
        grabs the cloth and yanks it out of RAJAH's mouth.)
        Confound it, Rajah!  So, this is why Prince Achmed
        stormed out!
JASMINE:    Oh, father.  Rajah was just playing with him,
        weren't you Rajah.  (RAJAH comes over and allows
        JASMINE to pet and hug him.)  You were just playing
        with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
        weren't you?  (She cuddles with RAJAH, enjoying the
        moment, until she looks up at her angry father. )
        Ahem.
SULTAN: Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor
        that comes to call.  The law says you...
BOTH:       ...must be married to a prince.

(They walk over to a dove cage.)

SULTAN: By your next birthday.
JASMINE:    The law is wrong.
SULTAN: You've only got three more days!
JASMINE:    Father,  I hate being forced into this.  (She takes
        a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry,
        I want it to be for love.
SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not only this law.  (She hands him
        the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I'm not
        going to be around forever, and I just want to make
        sure you're taken care of, provided for.
JASMINE:    Try to understand.  I've never done a thing on my
        own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the
        pond, petting the fish.)I've never had any real
        friends. (RAJAH looks up at her and growls.)
        Except you, Rajah.  (Satisfied, he goes back to
        sleep.)  I've never even been outside the palace
        walls.
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you're a princess.
JASMINE:    Then maybe I don't want to be a princess.  (She
        splashes the water.)
SULTAN: Oooohhh!  Allah forbid you should have any
        daughters!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second.  JASMINE goes to the dove
    cage and yanks open the door.  The birds fly off into freedom.
      She watches them go.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chambers.)

SULTAN: I don't know where she gets it from.  Her mother
        wasn't nearly so picky.  (A shadow falls over him.
        He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.)  Ooh, oh.
        Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor.  I am in
        desperate need of your wisdom.
JAFAR:  My life is but to serve you, my lord.  (He bows.)
SULTAN: It's this suitor business.  Jasmine refuses to
        choose a husband.  I'm at my wit's-end.
IAGO:   (In the parrot voice) Awk!  Wit's-end.
SULTAN: Oh, ha ha.  Have a cracker, pretty polly!  (He
        pulls a cracker out from his pocket.  IAGO looks
        terrified.  Then the SULTAN stuffs it in IAGO's
        mouth.  IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it.  JAFAR
        and the SULTAN both laugh.)
JAFAR:  Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
        (IAGO glares at him.)  Now then, perhaps I can
        divine a solution to this thorny problem.
SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you.
JAFAR:  Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue
        diamond.
SULTAN: Uh, my ring?  But it's been in the family for
        years.
JAFAR:  It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
        (JAFAR says the word 'princess' with the accent on
        the second syllable, "cess."  He turns his staff
        with a cobra head towards the SULTAN.  The eyes of
        the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR's
        voice slows down and deepens.  The SULTAN's eyes
        get a hypnotized look.)  Don't worry.  Everything
        will be fine.
SULTAN: Everything...will be...fine.
JAFAR:  The diamond.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.

(The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns
    to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.)

JAFAR:  You are most gracious, my liege.  Now run along and
        play with your little toys.
SULTAN: (Still hypnotized)  Yes...that'll be...pretty good.

(JAFAR and IAGO exit.  We follow them. When they're out of the room,
    the parrot spits out the cracker.)

IAGO:       I can't take it anymore!  If I gotta choke down on
        one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...bam!
        Whack!

(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)

JAFAR:  Calm yourself, Iago.
IAGO:       Then I'd grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack!
JAFAR:  (Speaking over IAGO.)  Soon, I will be sultan, not
        that addlepated twit.
IAGO:       And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha
        ha!

(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut.  Diss. to ext. gardens
    at night.  A shadowy figure walks through.  We see it is JASMINE
    in disguise.  She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it.
      She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.)

JASMINE:    Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  But I can't stay here and
        have my life lived for me.  I'll miss you.(She
        begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH,
        who begins to whine and whimper.)  Good bye!

(She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street  ALADDIN
    and ABU are up to their capers again.  They are on top of the
    awning of a fruit stand.)

ALADDIN:        Okay, Abu.  Go!

(ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.)

PROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds
            will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and
            hangs there, distracting his attention.)  Hey,
            get your paws off that.
ABU:            Blah blah blah!
PROPRIETOR: Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape!

(He grabs the melon away from ABU.  But in the foreground, ALADDIN
    dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.)

ABU:            Bye bye!

(He zings back up.  The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front,
    where he places it on top of a stack.  He looks confused, like
    he has just done this.)

ALADDIN:    Nice goin' Abu.  Breakfast is served.

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat.  We see J
    ASMINE walking through the street.)

SHOPKEEPER 1:   Pretty lady, buy a pot.  No finer pot in brass
            or silver.
SHOPKEEPER 2:   Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs!  Sugar
            dates and pistachios!
SHOPKEEPER 3:   Would the lady like a necklace.  A pretty
            necklace for a pretty lady.

(She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust
    into her face.)

SHOPKEEPER 4:   Fresh fish!  We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
JASMINE:    I don't think so.  (She backs away, but bumps into
        a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his
        fire.)  Oh, excuse me.  (He gulps, then belches
        fire from his mouth.  JASMINE is disgusted.  He is
        pleased and taps his stomach.  ALADDIN sees her,
        and a strange look comes over his face.)  I'm
        really very sorry.
ALADDIN:    (He's obviously deeply in love with her.)  Wow!

(She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head.  ABU sees him and
    jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's
    face.)

ABU:        Uh oh.  Hello?  Hello?

(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child
    reaching for a piece of fruit.  She picks one up and gives it to
    him.)

JASMINE:        Oh, you must be hungry.  Here you go.  (The
            boy runs off.)
PROPRIETOR: You'd better be able to pay for that.
JASMINE:        (Mystified) Pay?
PROPRIETOR: No one steals from my cart!
JASMINE:        Oh, I'm sorry sir.  I don't have any money.
PROPRIETOR: Thief!
JASMINE:        Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can
            get some from the Sultan.
PROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

(He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to
    chop it off.)

JASMINE:        No, no please!

(The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN's.)

ALADDIN:        Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found
            her. I've been looking all over for you.
JASMINE:        (whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN:        (whispering back) Just play along.
PROPRIETOR: You know this girl?
JASMINE:        Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little
            crazy.  (He circles his finger around his ear.
            She is shocked.  The PROPRIETOR grabs him by
            the vest.)
PROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan!
ALADDIN:        She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU is picking a pocket.  He hears this, then straightens up.
    JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)

JASMINE:        Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you?
ABU:            Well, blah blah blah blah.
ALADDIN:        Tragic, isn't it?  (He leans forward, picking
            up another apple from the cart with his
            foot.) But, no harm done.  (Walks over to
            Jasmine.)  Now come along sis. Time to see the
            doctor.
JASMINE:        (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor.
            How are you?
ALADDIN:        No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose
            pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.

(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he's stolen from the cart falls
    out.)

PROPRIETOR: Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can
            carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here,
            you little thieves!

(Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab.  IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre
    contraption.  At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.)

IAGO:       (huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your
        rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
JAFAR:  Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the
        SULTAN's ring in the contraption.)
IAGO:       Yes, o mighty evil one.

(IAGO runs faster.  A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing
    into an hourglass below.  The sands begin to swirl.)

JAFAR:  Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can
        enter the cave.  (The sand in top forms the Cave of
        Wonders.  It falls through into a storm, but it
        shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by
        JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) Yes, yes!
        There he is.  My diamond in the rough!
IAGO:       That's him?!?!   That's the clown we've been
        waitin' for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked
        into the gears.)
JAFAR:  Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to
        the palace, shall we?

(IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.)

IAGO:   Swell.

(JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with
    ALADDIN in it.  Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing
    to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)

ALADDIN:    Almost there.

(JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
    She stands up.)

JASMINE:    I want to thank you for stopping that man.
ALADDIN:    Uh, forget it.  (He grabs a pole.)  So, uh, this is
        your first time in the marketplace, huh?

(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE:    Is it that obvious?
ALADDIN:    Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her,
        still in love.  She returns the look.  But he
        realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.)
        I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous
        Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the
        buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned
        down, she vaults over his head.  He looks back in
        surprise.  She tosses the pole to him.  Both
        ALADDIN's and ABU's eyes bulge.)
JASMINE:    I'm a fast learner.
ALADDIN:    Right.  C'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof
        of a building, dodging planks and beams as they
        go.)  Whoa.  Watch your head there.  Be careful.
JASMINE:    Is this where you live?
ALADDIN:    Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please.
JASMINE:    Fabulous.
ALADDIN:    Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and
        exposes the palace) but it's got a great view.
        Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
JASMINE:    Oh, it's wonderful.
ALADDIN:    I wonder what it would be like to live there, to
        have servants and valets...
JASMINE:    Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how
        to dress.
ALADDIN:    It's better than here.  Always scraping for food
        and ducking the guards.
JASMINE:    You're not free to make your own choices.
ALADDIN:    Sometimes you feel so--
JASMINE:    You're just--
BOTH:       (in unison) --trapped.

(They look at each other, realizing that they're perfect for one
    another.  But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the
    look.  He takesthe apple out of ABU's hand and rolls it down his
    arm into the hand of JASMINE.)

ALADDIN:    So, where're you from?
JASMINE:    What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not
        going back.
ALADDIN:    Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his
        hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted
        look on his face.)
ABU:        Why you!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.)

JASMINE:    My father's forcing me to get married.
ALADDIN:    That's--that's awful.  (ABU appears from behind the
        princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.)

JASMINE:    What?
ALADDIN:    Abu says that--uh--that's not fair.
ABU:        What?
JASMINE:    Oh did he?
ALADDIN:    Yeah, of course.
JASMINE:    And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN:    Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do
        to help.
ABU:        Oh, boy!
JASMINE:    Hmm, tell him that's very sweet.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until
    ALADDIN leans in to kiss her.  He is interrupted, however,
    by the GUARDS, who have found them.)

GUARD:  Here you are!
ALADDIN and JASMINE:    They've found me!  (To each other) They're
                after you?
JASMINE:    My father must have sent them--
ALADDIN:    Do you trust me?
JASMINE:    What?
ALADDIN:    Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)
JASMINE:    Yes. (She takes it.)
ALADDIN:    Then jump!

(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt.  They
    try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)

GUARD:  We just keep running into each other, don't we,
        street rat?

(Again, the GUARD's turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are
    here and block the exit.  The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and
     throws him in a vase.  Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)

GUARD:  It's the dungeon for you, boy.
ALADDIN:    Hey, get off of me!
JASMINE:    Let go of him.
GUARD:  (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we
        have here, men--a street mouse.  (He throws her
        down.)
JASMINE:    (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak)
        Unhand him, by order of the princess.

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)

GUARD:  Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN:    The princess?
ABU:        (peeking out from the vase) The princess?
GUARD:  What are you doing outside the palace?  And with
        this street rat?
JASMINE:    That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release
        him!
GUARD:  Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from
        Jafar.  You'll have to take it up with him.

(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.)

JASMINE:    (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, I
        will.

(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers.  He
    slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming
    in before he is finished.  He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside
    the door frame.)

JASMINE:    Jafar?
JAFAR:  Oh, uh, princess.
IAGO:       Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck!
JAFAR:  How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his
        cape, hiding the door.)
JASMINE:    The guards just took a boy from the market, on your
        orders.
JAFAR:  Your father's charged me with keeping peace in
        Agrabah.  The boy was a criminal.
JASMINE:    What was the crime?
IAGO:       I can't breathe, Jafar!
JAFAR:  Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
IAGO:       If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the
        door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt!
JASMINE:    He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!
JAFAR:  (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear!  Oh, why
        frightfully upsetting.  Had I but known.
JASMINE:    What do you mean?
JAFAR:  Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried
        out.
JASMINE:    What sentence?
JAFAR:  (with a sinister tone)  Death.  (JASMINE gasps.)
        By beheading.
JASMINE:    No!  (She collapses to the floor.)
JAFAR:  I am exceedingly sorry, princess.
JASMINE:    How could you?  (She runs from the room crying.)

(IAGO finally makes it out through the door.  He flies up and lands on
    JAFAR's shoulder, coughing.)

IAGO:       So, how did  it go?
JAFAR:  I think she took it rather well.  (They both get a
        sinister smile on their faces.)

(Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain.  RAJAH
    comes over to comfort her.  She pets him.)

JASMINE:    It's all my fault, Rajah.  I didn't even know his
        name.

(Cut to int. of dungeon.  Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see
    ALADDIN chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN:    (to himself) She was the princess.  I don't believe
        it.  I must have sounded so stupid to her.
ABU:        (from a distance) Yoo-hoo!  Aladdin? Hello!

(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)

ALADDIN:    Abu!  Down here!  Hey, c'mon--help me outta these.

(ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground.  He
     wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an
     imitation of the princess.)

ALADDIN:    Hey, she was in trouble.  Ah, she was worth it.

(ABU jumps up on ALADDIN's shoulders and pulls a small set of tools
    out of his pocket, then frees ALADDIN.)

ABU:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ALADDIN:    Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.  I'm a
        street rat, remember, and there's a law. She's
        gotta marry a prince, she deserves it.

(ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands.)

ABU:        Ta da!
ALADDIN:    (Rubbing his wrists) I'm a--I'm a fool
OLD MAN:    You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

(We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU
    have seen before.)

ALADDIN:    Who are you?
OLD MAN:    A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together,
        perhaps we can be more.
ALADDIN:    I'm listening.
OLD MAN:    There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled
        with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
        Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd
        wager.

(Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word
    'princess' as "prin-CESS" rather than the standard pronunciation
     of "PRIN-cess."   The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks
    his head out of JAFAR's "old man" disguise.)

IAGO:       Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I'm dyin' in here!
ALADDIN:    But the law says that only a prince can marry--
OLD MAN:    You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy?
        Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(He grins,
        showing a hideously bad mouth.)
ALADDIN:    So why would you share all of this wonderful
        treasure with me?
OLD MAN:    I need a young man with strong legs and a strong
        back to go in after it.
ALADDIN:    Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here?

(The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.)

OLD MAN:    Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren't always what they
        seem.  So, do we have a deal?

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)

ABU:        Oh, hmm.

(Cut to desert scene.  We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the
    OLD MAN and ABU on it.  Diss. to cave of wonders.)

CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?
ALADDIN:    It is I, Aladdin.
CAVE:       Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp.

(The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of
    ALADDIN. )

OLD MAN:    Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, and then
        you shall have your reward.
ALADDIN:    C'mon, Abu.  (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of
        his vest.)

(ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase.  He reaches the bottom
    and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.)

ALADDIN:    Would ya look at that!
ABU:        Uh oh!
ALADDIN:    Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer
        than the sultan!

(ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.)

ALADDIN:    Abu!

(ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.)

ALADDIN:    Don't...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp.

(They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises
    off the floor and begins following them.  ABU gets the feeling
    they're being followed.)

ABU:        Huh?

(He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and
    the CARPET begins to follow again.  Again, ABU turns back, but the
     CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU
     runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.)

ABU:        Aladdin!  Aladdin!
ALADDIN:    Abu, will ya knock it off?

(Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet
    jumps to the other side.  It reaches down with a tassel and pulls
    ABU's tail.  When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other
     side.  This time, ABU lands in a karate stance.  CARPET reaches
    down and plucks ABU's hat off, then puts it on himself.  ABU sits
    thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his
     face.  ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away.  ABU tackles
     ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)

ALADDIN:    Abu, what are you--crazy?

(The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.)

ALADDIN:    A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.  I'm not gonna
        hurt you.

(The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts
    it off.  It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to
     him.  ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulder.)

ALADDIN:    Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite.

(The CARPET again picks up ABU's hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes
    his fist and screeches at it.  CARPET begins to walk away, "sadly.")

ALADDIN:    Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Maybe you can help
        us.  (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies
        over and wraps around the pair.)  Hey, whoa!  You
        see, we're trying to find this lamp.  (CARPET
        motions for them to follow it.)  I think he knows
        where it is.

(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant
    underground cavern.  In the centre of the room is a tall pillar,
     with a staircase going up to it.  It is surrounded by water
     with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge.  At the top of
    the pillar is a beam of light.  ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN:    Wait here!
ABU:        Oh.  Huh?

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a
    giant ruby.  ABU is hypnotically drawn to it.   ALADDIN climbs the
     stairs quickly.  CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain
     to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN:    This is it?  This is what we came all the way down
        here to--  (He looks down and sees ABU break free
        of CARPET's hold and lunge toward the jewel.)  Abu-
        NO!

(ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to
    shake.)

CAVE VOICE: Infidels!
ABU:            Uh oh!
CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU
               places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel
                and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you
                will never again see the light of day!

(ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he
    skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into
     lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears
    and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the
    bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava.
    Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock
     is exploding.)

ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Carpet, let's move!

(Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling
    debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.)

ALADDIN:    Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off
        his head and sees they are flying into a wall.)
        Start panicking.

(CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they
    emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to
     growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a
    boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs
    onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top,
    within reach.)

ALADDIN:    Help me out!
OLD MAN:    Throw me the lamp!
ALADDIN:    I can't hold on.  Give me your hand.
OLD MAN:    First give me the lamp!

(ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a
    nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)

OLD MAN:    Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha!

(ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD
     MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)

ALADDIN:    What are you doing?
OLD MAN:    Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his
        normal voice.) Your eternal reward.

(He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when
    ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN,
     who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as
     well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a
     boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races
     up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several
    times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one
    final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off
     his disguise.)

JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't
        find it in his pocket)--- where is it?  No. NO!!

(Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next
    to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.)

SULTAN: Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong?
JASMINE:    Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She
        looks as if she's been crying.)
SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right.
        Now, tell me everything.

(Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET.
    ABU tries to wake him.)

ABU:        Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin.

(CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.)

ALADDIN:    Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.)
        We're trapped.  (Angry, shaking his fists at the
        entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal!  (Calmer)
        Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.
ABU:        Aha!

(ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN:    Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a
        beat-up, worthless piece of junk.  Hey, I think
        there's something written here, but it's hard to
        make out.

(He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the
    LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the
    LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.)

GENIE:  Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya
        such a crick in the neck!  (He hangs ALADDIN on a
        nearby rock.  Then he pulls his head off and spins
        it around, yelling as he does so.  CARPET pulls a
        ALADDIN down.)  Whoa!  Does it feel good to be
        outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as
        a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and
        gentlemen.  Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in
        ALADDIN's face.)  What's your name?
ALADDIN:    Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.
GENIE:  (Says his name as if he's discovered something
        major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with
        ALADDIN's name on it, circled by chase lights.  The
        sign changes to reflect the GENIE's upcoming line.)
        Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.  Can
        we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?'  Or how
        bout 'Laddi?'  (GENIE disappears, then a dog
        wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like 'Here, boy!
        C'mon, Laddi!'
ALADDIN:    (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder
        than I thought.
GENIE:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog
        poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU
        screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I
        didn't singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven't seen
        you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo!
        Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE.
        GENIE looks at ALADDIN.)  Say, you're a lot smaller
        than my last master. (Lifts his beer-gut.)  Either
        that or I'm gettin' bigger.  Look at me from the
        side--do I look different to you?
ALADDIN:    Wait a minute!  I'm--your master?
GENIE:  (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a
        mortarboard on his head.)  That's right!  He can
        be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold
        Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a
        cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with
        a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside)
        but never duplicated--

(He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.)

DUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,
            duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated,
            duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.
GENIE:  (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.)
        Genie!  Of!  The Lamp!  (Goes into Ed
        Sullivan)  Right here direct from the lamp, right
        here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment.
        Thank youuuuu!
ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Wish fulfillment?
GENIE:  Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the
        wishing for more wishes.  (Turns into a slot
        machine, arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in
        the windows.)  That's it--three.  (Three GENIE
        caballeros come out of the slot.)  Uno, dos, tres.
        (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.)  No
        substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck
        drops with the secret word "Refunds.'
ALADDIN:    (To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming.
GENIE:  (Music for "Friend Like Me" begins) Master, I don't
        think you quite realize what you've got here! So
        why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate
        the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a
        fluorescent light)

    Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
    Scheherazadie had a thousand tales
    But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeve
    You got a brand of magic never fails!

(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
    GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes
    the thieves into submission.)

    You got some power in your corner now
    Some heavy ammunition in your camp
    You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
    See all you gotta do is rub that lamp
    And I'll say

(Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged
    by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and
    explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's
     hand and rubs lamp with it.)

    Mister Aladdin sir
    What will your pleasure be?
    Let me take your order, jot it down
    You ain't never had a friend like me
    No no no!

(GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a
    note pad, like a waiter. )

    Life is your restaurant
    And I'm your maitre' d!
    C'mon whisper what it is you want
    You ain't never had a friend like me.

(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal,
    but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes
     into four duplicate GENIEs.)

    Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
    You're the boss, the king, the shah!
    Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish
    How about a little more Baklava?

(The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN
    appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure
    and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the
    screen with baklava.)

    Try some of column 'A'
    Try all of column 'B'
    I'm in the mood to help you dude
    You ain't never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top,
    then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off
    and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth,
    and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE
     dressed like a magician comes out.)

(The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant
    hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish
    him into nothing.)

    Can your friends do this?
    Do your friends do that?
    Do your friends pull this out their little hat
    Can your friends go poof!
    Well looky here
    Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip
    And then make the sucker disappear?

(The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them.
    He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins
    one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses
     the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull
     himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around
     until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into
    a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
     The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,
    who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them,
     they disappear.)

    So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
    I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
    You got me bona fide, certified
    You got a genie for a charg? d'affairs!
    I got a powerful urge to help you out
    So what you wish I really want to know
    You got a wish that's three miles long, no doubt
    So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh!


(GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a
    certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls
     a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses
    to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.)

    Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
    I'm on the job, you big nabob
    You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
    You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
    You ain't never...had a... friend... like...me!
    You ain't never had a friend like me!

(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one.
     She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into
    existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels,
     and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold
     as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and
    zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a
    neon "APPLAUSE" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and
    sees that is is empty.)

GENIE:  So what'll it be, master?
ALADDIN:    You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want?
GENIE:  (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost.  There are a
        few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos
ALADDIN:    Like?
GENIE:  Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody.  (He
        slices his head off with his finger.)  So don't
        ask.  Rule two: I can't make anyone fall in love
        with anyone else.  (Head turns into a big pair of
        lips which kiss ALADDIN.)  You little punim, there.
        (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a
        zombie.) Rule three: I can't bring people back from
        the dead.  It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs
        ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing it!  (He
        poofs back to normal.)  Other than that, you got
        it!
ALADDIN:    (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos?  You
        mean limitations?  On wishes? (To ABU) Some all
        powerful genie--can't even bring people back from
        the dead. I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even
        get us out of this cave.  Looks like we're gonna
        have to find a way out of here--

(They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of
    them.)

GENIE:  Excuse me?  Are you lookin' at
        me?  Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did
        you bring me here?  And all of a sudden, you're
        walkin' out on me?  (Gets madder and madder) I
        don't think so, not right now.  You're gettin' your
        wishes, so siddown!  (They all get on CARPET.
        GENIE takes the form of a stewardess, with lots of
        arms pointing out the exits.)  In case of
        emergency, the exits are here, here, here,
        here,here, here, here, here, here, here, here,
        here, anywhere!  Keep your hands and arms inside
        the carpet.  Weeee'rrrrrreee...outta here!

(The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off
    into the distance.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. JAFAR is
    there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage.  If it weren't for all
        your years of loyal service... . From now on,
        you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me,
        before they are beheaded.
JAFAR:  I assure you, your highness, it won't happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy
        business behind us.  Please?
JAFAR:  My most abject and humblest apologies to you as
        well, princess.  (He takes her hand to kiss it, but
        she yanks it away.)
JASMINE:    At least some good will come of my being forced to
        marry.  When I am queen, I will have the
        power to get rid of you.
SULTAN: That's nice.  All settled, then.  Now, Jasmine,
        getting back to this suitor business, (he
        looks and sees Jasmine walking out) Jasmine?
        Jasmine!  (He runs after her.)
JAFAR:  If only I had gotten that lamp!
IAGO:       (As JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of
        you!  D'oh!  To think--we gotta keep kissing
        up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the
        rest of our lives...
JAFAR:  No, Iago.  Only until she finds a chump husband.
        Then she'll have us banished--or beheaded!
BOTH:       Eeewww!
IAGO:       (Has an idea) Oh!  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
        Jafar?  What if you were the chump husband?
JAFAR:  (He looks at IAGO in insult)  What?
IAGO:       Okay, you marry the princess,all right? Then, uh,
        you become sultan!
JAFAR:  Oh!Marry the shrew?  I become sultan.  The idea has
        merit!
IAGO:       Yes, merit! Yes!  And then we drop papa-in-law and
        the little woman off a cliff!  (Dive bombs into the
        floor)  Kersplat!
JAFAR:  Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works!

(Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is
    coming in for a landing.)

GENIE:  (Still as stewardess) Thank you for choosing Magic
        Carpet for all your travel needs.  Don't stand
        until the rug has come to a complete stop.  (As
        ALADDIN and ABU get off down the stairway formed by
        CARPET) Thank you.  Good bye, good bye!  Thank you!
        Good bye!  (Back to normal)  Well, now.  How about
        that, Mr.  doubting mustafa?
ALADDIN:    Oh, you sure showed me.  Now about my three wishes-
GENIE:  Dost mine ears deceive me?  Three? You are down by
        ONE, boy!
ALADDIN:    Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the
        cave.  You did that on your own.

(GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops.  He turns into a
    sheep.)

GENIE:  Well, don't I feel just sheepish?  All right, you
        baaaaad boy,  but no more freebies.
ALADDIN:    Fair deal.  So, three wishes.  I want them to be
        good.  (To GENIE) What would you wish for?

(GENIE is hanging like a hammock between two trees.)

GENIE:  Me?  No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in
        my case, ah, forget it.
ALADDIN:    What?  No, tell me.
GENIE:  Freedom.
ALADDIN:    You're a prisoner?
GENIE:  It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig.
        (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic
        powers!  (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.)
        Itty bitty living space
ALADDIN:    Genie, that's terrible.
GENIE:  (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not
        have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do
        you need? Poof! What do you need?"  To be my own
        master, such a thing would be greater than all the
        magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But
        what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real
        here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and
        smell the hummus
ALADDIN:    Why not?
GENIE:  The only way I get outta this is if my master
        wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's
        happened.
ALADDIN:    I'll do it. I'll set you free.
GENIE:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh
        huh, right.  Whoop!
ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in
        and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my
        first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you
        free.   (He holds out his hand)
GENIE:  Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.)
        O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a
        magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want
        most?
ALADDIN:    Well, there's this girl--
GENIE:  Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a
        heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't
        make anybody fall in love, remember?
ALADDIN:    Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and...
GENIE:  Pretty?
ALADDIN:    Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and
        this hair, wow...and her smile.
GENIE:  (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.)
        Ami.  C'est l'amour.
ALADDIN:    But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd
        have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince?
GENIE:  Let's see here.  (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Uh,
        chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a
        crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab?
        (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from
        "The Little Mermaid"  clamped on.)  Ow, I
        hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A
        dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu,
        Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at
        ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the
        words!
ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!
GENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square
        shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes
        a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and
        vest combo is much too third century. These
        patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No!
        Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's
        measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is
        outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy
        macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it
        say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse
        me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to
        cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and
        he flies over.)
ABU:        Uh oh!
GENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game
        show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with
        "AL" on it.)  And what better way to make your
        grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than
        riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out,
        it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it
        opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He
        spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the
        GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his
        fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.)
        Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need?
        (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning
        ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57
        Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1."   (That one's
        a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail
        fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to
        normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!!
        (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns
        into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from
        under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk
        space, check this action out!

(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree.
     The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU
     hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.)

ALADDIN:    Abu, you look good.
GENIE:  He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but
        we're not through yet.  Hang on to your turban,
        kid, cause we're gonna make you a star!

(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks
    begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys.
    (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN
    balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top,
     then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the
    pile collapses.)

JAFAR:  Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with
        your daughter.
IAGO:   Awk!  The problem with your daughter!
SULTAN: Oh, really?
JAFAR:  (Unrolling a scroll) Right here.  "If the princess
        has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,
        then the sultan shall choose for her."
SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to
        stuff a cracker into IAGO's mouth.  IAGO backs
        away.  The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker
        back.)  How could I choose someone she hates?
        (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a
        cracker in his mouth.)
JAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the
        event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess
        must then be wed to...hmm...interesting.
SULTAN: What?  Who?
JAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me!
SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can
        marry a princess, I'm quite sure.
JAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my
        lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the
        SULTAN with it.)
SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...
JAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me.
SULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell
        breaks momentarily)...but you're so old!
JAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry
        me!
SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again
        broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince
        Ali".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha.
        Jafar., you must come and see this!

(We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in
    human form as a MAJOR.)

MARCHERS:   Make way for Prince Ali!
SWORDSMEN: Say hey!  It's Prince Ali!
MAJOR:  Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar,
    Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star,
    Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!
    Make way, here he comes,
    Ring bells, bang the drums.
    You're gonna love this guy

(The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.)

    Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa!
    Genuflect, show some respect
    Down on one knee

(ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.)

    Now try your best to stay calm
    Brush up your Sunday Salaam
    And come and meet his spectacular coterie.

(IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The
    MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men up onto ABU's trunk.  They stand
    on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.)

    Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa!
    Strong as ten regular men, definitely
    He faced the galloping hordes
    A hundred bad guys with swords
    Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali!

(The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt
    zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic
     wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child
    and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.)

CHORUS OF MEN:(Carrying the camels) He's got seventy-five golden camels!

(In pops a typical parade commentator)

HARRY:  Don't they look lovely, June?

CHORUS OF WOMEN:    (On a float)  Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three!

(In comes another commentator.)

JUNE:   Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers!

GENIE:  (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down
            the parade)
    When it comes to exotic type mammals
    Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you
    It's a world class menagerie!

(GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two
    lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony,
    where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)

    GENIE:
        GIRLS: (in couterpoint)
    Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
        There's no question this Ali's alluring
    That physique, how can I speak
        Never ordinary, never boring
    Weak at the knee
        Everything about the man just plain impresses
    Well, get on out in that square
        He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder
    Adjust your veil and prepare
        He's about to pull my heart asunder
    To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!
        And I absolutely love the way he dresses!

(JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She
    humphs it off, then leaves.)

CHORUS: He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
    (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!)
    And to view them, he charges no fee!
    (He's generous, so generous)
    He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies!
    (Proud to work for him)
    They bow to his whim, love serving him
    They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to
    collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the
    palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door
    to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door.
    Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing
     JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

GENIE:  Prince Ali!
    Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa
    Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see!
    And that,good people, is why
    He got dolled up and dropped by
    With sixty elephants, llamas galore
    With his bears and lions
    A brass band and more
    With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
    His birds that warble on key
    Make way for Prince Ali!

(More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back
    on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the
     door shut.)

SULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous.
ALADDIN:    (Takes on a deeper voice.)  Ahem.  Your majesty, I have
            journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to
        meet you.  (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.)
        This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He's delighted
        too.
JAFAR:  (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic.  I'm afraid, Prince
        Abooboo--
ALADDIN:    --Ababwa!
JAFAR:  Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited
        and expect to--
SULTAN: ...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.
        (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his
        moustache.)  I don't suppose I might...
ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me.

(He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down.
    JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.)

JAFAR:  Sire, I must advise against this--
SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun.

(He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who
    was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly
     bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and
    CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack,
     flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the
    background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.)

JAFAR:  Just where did you say you were from?
ALADDIN:    Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure.
        (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.)
JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.)
SULTAN: Look out, Polly!

(They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their
    heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)

IAGO:       Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug!

(The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and
    crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head
    is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying "Have a cracker,
    have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Out of the way, I'm coming in to land.  Jafar,
        watch this!  (He lands.)
JAFAR:  Spectacular, your highness.
SULTAN: Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do seem to have a knack for
        it.  (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then
        collapses.  ABU catches it.)  This is a very
        impressive youth. And a prince as well.   (Whispers
        to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to marry
        Jasmine after all.
JAFAR:  I don't trust him, sire.
SULTAN: Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I'm
        an excellent judge of character.
IAGO:   Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...not!!!

(JASMINE walks in quietly.)

SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one!
ALADDIN:    And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine!
JAFAR:  Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine's
        behalf.  (JASMINE hears this and gets mad.) This
        boy is no different than the others.  What makes
        him think he is worthy of the princess?
ALADDIN:    Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks
        JAFAR's goatee, which springs out in all
        directions.)  Just let her meet me.  I will win
        your daughter!
JASMINE:    How dare you!  (They all look at her surprised.)
        All of you, standing around deciding my future?  I
        am not a prize to be won!  (She storms out.)
SULTAN: Oh, dear.  Don't worry, Prince Ali.  Just give
        Jasmine time to cool down.  (They exit.)
JAFAR:  I think it's time to say good bye to Prince
        Abooboo.

(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find
    ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)

ALADDIN:    What am I going to do?  Jasmine won't even let me
        talk to her.  I should have known I couldn't pull
        off this stupid prince wish.  (ABU struggles with
        his elephant paws to open a banana.  He squishes
        it, and the banana squirts into his eye.  He then
        tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the
        same.)
GENIE:  (to carpet, playing chess) So move!  (CARPET does,
        knocking a black piece off the board.)  Hey.
        That's a good move.  (As Rodney Dangerfield) I
        can't believe it--I'm losing to a rug.
ALADDIN:    Genie, I need help.
GENIE:  (as Jack Nicholson) All right, sparky, here's the
        deal.  You wanna court the little lady, you gotta
        be a straight shooter, do ya follow me?
ALADDIN:    What?
GENIE:  (Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points
        out his words on a blackboard)  Tell her
        the...TRUTH!!!
ALADDIN:    No way!  If Jasmine found out I was really some
        crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me. (He
        puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.)
GENIE:  A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh!
        (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light.
        GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all
        joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself.
ALADDIN:    Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay,
        I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool,
        confident.  How do I look?
GENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed,
    sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.)

ALADDIN:    (From a distance) Princess Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and growls.)

JASMINE:    Who's there?
ALADDIN:    It's me--Prince Ali.  Ahem--(Then he jumps to his
        deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE:    I do not want to see you.
ALADDIN:    No, no, please princess.  Give me a chance. (RAJAH
        growls and advances on him.)
JAFAR:  Just leave me alone.
ALADDIN:    Down kitty!

(Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.)

GENIE:  How's our beau doing?

(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.)

ALADDIN:    Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off
        his turban to brush RAJAH away.)
JASMINE:    (She looks at him thinking she has seen him
        before.)  Wait, wait.  Do I know you?
ALADDIN:    (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no.
JASMINE:    You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace.
ALADDIN:    The marketplace?  (A bee buzzes around his head.)
        I have servants that go to the marketplace for me.
        Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace
        for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you
        met.
JASMINE:    (She looks disappointed.)  No, I guess not.
BEE:        (It's the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk
        about her! She's smart,  fun, the hair, the eyes.
        Anything--pick a feature!
ALADDIN:    Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very...
BEE:        Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!
ALADDIN:    Punctual!
JASMINE:    Punctual?
BEE:        Sorry.
ALADDIN:    Beautiful.
BEE:        Nice recovery.
JASMINE:    Hmm.  I'm rich too, you know.
ALADDIN:    Yeah!
JASMINE:    The daughter of a sultan
ALADDIN:    I know.
JASMINE:    A fine prize for any  prince to marry.
ALADDIN:    Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me.
BEE:        (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning!
JASMINE:    Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt,
             swaggering, peacock I've met!
BEE:        (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday!
              Mayday!
JASMINE:    Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away)
ALADDIN:    What?
BEE:        Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?
ALADDIN:    (Swats at bee) Buzz off!
BEE:        Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into
             his turban)
ALADDIN:    Yeah, right!
JASMINE:    What!?!
ALADDIN:    Uh, you're right.  You aren't just some prize to be
        won.  (He looks disappointed.)  You should be free
        to make your own choice.  (JASMINE and RAJAH look
        at each other in confusion.)  I'll go now. (He
        steps up on the ledge and drops off.)
JASMINE:    No!
ALADDIN:    (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What?  What?
JASMINE:    (Now she's amazed) How--how are you doing that?
        (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)
ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet.
JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a
        tassel.)
ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you?
        We could get out of the palace, see the world.
JASMINE:    Is it safe?
ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me?
JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all-
        important line) What?
ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust
        me?
JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes.

(She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky,
    knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of "A Whole
     New World" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking
    up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace
     wall and into the sky.)

ALADDIN:    I can show you the world
    Shining, shimmering, splendid.
    Tell me princess, now when did you last
    Let your heart decide?

(CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a
    flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.
      She smiles.)

    I can open your eyes
    Take you wonder by wonder
    Over, sideways, and under
    On a magic carpet ride


(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.)

    A whole new world!
    A new fantastic point of view
    No one to tell us no
    Or where to go
    Or say we're only dreaming

(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET
    flies in and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE:    A whole new world
    A dazzling place I never knew
    But when I'm way up here
    It's crystal clear
    That now I'm in a whole new world with you!

ALADDIN:    Now I'm in a whole new world with you!

(They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It
    then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.)

JASMINE:    Unbelievable sights
    Indescribable feeling
    Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
    Through an endless diamond sky

(They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified
    and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting
    ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then
    zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)

JASMINE:    A whole new world!
ALADDIN:    Don't you dare close your eyes
JASMINE:    An hundred thousand things to see
ALADDIN:    Hold your breath--it gets better!
JASMINE:    I'm like a shooting star,
    I've come so far
    I can't go back to where I used to be!

(They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the
     ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker
     sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but
    chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.)

ALADDIN:    A whole new world!
JASMINE:    Every turn a surprise
ALADDIN:    With new horizons to pursue
JASMINE:    Every moment, red-letter

(They fly alongside wild horses running.  JASMINE pets one of them.)

BOTH:   I'll chase them anywhere
    There's time to spare
    Let me share this whole new world with you

    A whole new world
    That's where we'll be

(They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a
    tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure
    she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)

ALADDIN:    A thrilling chase
JASMINE:    A wondrous place
BOTH:       For you and me!

(CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of
    the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple
    at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.)

JASMINE:    It's all so magical.
ALADDIN:    Yeah.
JASMINE:    (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
        It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
ALADDIN:    Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up
        realizing what is happening.)  He doesn't really
        like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it)
        That is...oh no!
JASMINE:    (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the
        market!  I knew it.  Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry.
JASMINE:    Did you think I was stupid?
ALADDIN:    No!
JASMINE:    That I wouldn't figure it out?
ALADDIN:    No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.  No, that's not
        what I meant.
JASMINE:    Who are you?  Tell me the truth!
ALADDIN:    The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on,
        giving up hope.)  The truth...the truth is...I
        sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the
        pressures of palace life.  (CARPET slumps down in
        defeat.)  But I really am a prince! (The feather on
         his turban falls down over his eyes.)
JASMINE:    Why didn't you just tell me?
ALADDIN:    Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the
        city in disguise, it sounds a little strange,
        don't you think?
JASMINE:    Not that strange.

(She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a
    tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext.
    of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET
    forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends
     just below the balcony.)

JASMINE:    Good night, my handsome prince.
ALADDIN:    Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they
    kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and
    looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN:    Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends
        to the ground.) For the first time in my life,
        things are starting to go right.

(He looks up at JASMINE's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.)

ALADDIN:    Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth.
        Muffled words) Abu!  Abu!  (We see the elephant
        hanging from a net tied in a tree.)
GUARD:  Hold him!

(Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties
    CARPET in a knot around a tree.)

JAFAR:  I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince
        Abooboo.  (Walks away.)  Make sure he's
        never found.

(A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a
    cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water.
      He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock
     hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles
    out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he
    loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled
    by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes,
    and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap)

GENIE:  Never fails.  Get in the bath and there's a rub at
        the lamp.  (Squeaks the duck)  Hello.  (Sees
        unconscious ALADDIN) Al?  Al!  Kid, snap out of it!
        You can't cheat on this one!  I can't help you
        unless you make a wish.  You have to say  "Genie I
        want you to save my life."  Got it?  Okay.  C'mon
        Aladdin!!  (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and
        shakes him.  His head goes up, then falls.)  I'll
        take that as a yes.  (Head turns into a siren.)
        Wooga!  Wooga!  (Turns into a submarine.)  Up
        scope!  (He babbles in something that sounds like
        German.  On the surface, a giant water spout
        emerges, and lands on top of the cliff.  ALADDIN
        reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs.)
        Don't you scare me like that!
ALADDIN:    Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(He can't think of how to say
        it, so they just hug each other.)  Thanks, Genie.
GENIE:  Oh, Al.  I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.  Not
        that I want to pick out curtains or anything.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing
   her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.)

SULTAN: Jasmine!
JASMINE:    Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time.
        I'm so happy.
SULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be,
        Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you.
JASMINE:    What?
SULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.)  You will
        wed Jafar.

(JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.)

JAFAR:  You're speechless, I see.  A fine quality in a
        wife.
JASMINE:    I will never marry you.  (She goes to the SULTAN)
        Father, I choose Prince Ali!
JAFAR:  Prince Ali left!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.)

ALADDIN:    Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar!
JASMINE:    Prince Ali!

(JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.)

IAGO:       How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk!
ALADDIN:    Tell them the truth, Jafar!  You tried to have me
        killed.
JAFAR:  What?  (He goes to the SULTAN)  Ridiculous
        nonsense, your highness.  He is obviously lying.
        (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN's face.)
SULTAN: Obviously...lying.

(ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.)

JASMINE:    Father, what's wrong with you?
ALADDIN:    I know!

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches
    and the spell is broken for good.)

SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my!
ALADDIN:    Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with
        this!  (He advances the staff)
SULTAN: What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor!

(The trio advances on JAFAR.)

JAFAR:  Your majesty, all of this can be explained.
SULTAN: Guards! Guards!
IAGO:       Well, that's it--we're dead, forget about it.  Just
        dig a grave for both of us.  We're dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but
    is grabbed by guards.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once.
JAFAR:  This is not done yet, boy!

(JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes
    him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud
    appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find him, search everywhere!
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, are you all right?
JASMINE:    Yes.

(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.)

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against
        me all this time.  Just horrible.  How will I ever-
        (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.)
        Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a
        suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You
        brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll
        leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once!
        Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and
        then my boy, you will be sultan!
ALADDIN:    Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a
        person of your unimpeachable moral character is
        exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks
        concerned at this.)

(Cut to int. of JAFAR's chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO:       We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get--  I gotta
        start packing, your highness.  Only essentials.
        (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage.
        JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the
        guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out
        a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about
        this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a
        weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.)
        Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO
        flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar?
        Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around
        the neck) Good grip!
JAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin
        Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago.
IAGO:       Why that miserable--
JAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it!
IAGO:       Me?

(Cut to ext. of palace.  ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.)

ALADDIN:    Sultan?  They want me to be sultan?

(GENIE comes out of lamp)

GENIE:  Huzzah!  Hail the conquering hero!  (Turns into a
        one-man band.  He sees ALADDIN walk away with his
        head hung.  He stops, scratches his head, comes up
        with an idea, then zooms over to ALADDIN.  He holds
        up his hands like a director scoping a picture and
        we look through them.)  Aladdin, you've just won
        the heart of the princess.  What are you gonna do
        next?  (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away in
        sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs.
        GENIE again is confused, then goes to him and pulls
        out a script labeled "Aladdin." Whispering: )
        Psst, your line is "I'm going to free the genie."
        Anytime.
ALADDIN:    Genie...I can't.
GENIE:  Sure you can.  You just go "Genie, I wish you
        free."  (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses
        him as a mock ventriloquist's dummy.  ALADDIN pulls away.)
ALADDIN:    I'm serious.  Look, I'm sorry--I really am. But
        they want to make me sultan--no!, They want to make
        Prince Ali sultan.  Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
GENIE:  Al, you won!
ALADDIN:    Because of you!  The only reason anyone thinks I'm
        anything is because of you.  What if they find out
        I'm not really a prince?  (Quietly)  What if
        Jasmine finds out?  I'll lose her.  Genie, I can't
        keep this up on my own.  I can't wish you free.
GENIE:  (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand.  After all,
        you've lied to everyone else.  Hey, I was beginning
        to feel left out.  Now, if you'll excuse me,
        master. (He says the last word in disgust, then
        poofs back into the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.)

ABU:        Ohhh.
ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the
        spout and raspberries him.)   Well, fine. (He slams
        a pillow on top of the LAMP.)  Then just stay in
        there!  (He looks at ABU and CARPET.)  What are you
        guys looking at? (They both leave.) Look, I--I'm
        sorry.  Wait, Abu-- wait--I'm sorry, I didn't--
        wait, c'mon.  (He sighs.)  What am I doing?
        Genie's right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.
JASMINE:    (From a distance)  Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?
ALADDIN:    (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes.  (He walks
        into the garden.)  Jasmine?  Where are you?

(We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO
    in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.)

IAGO:       Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry.
ALADDIN:    I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs,
    then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is
    panting.)

FLAMINGO:   D'uh!
IAGO:       Ya got a problem, pinky?  (He sweeps the bird's
        feet out from under it. IAGO runs into the palace
        and finds the lamp under the pillow.)  Boy, Jafar's
        gonna be happy to see you!  (Stretches his face
        like JAFAR's and imitates it.)  Good work, Iago!
        (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale
        of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah,
        Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm
        blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.)

(Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making
    an announcement to the people.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a
        suitor!

(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN
    appears at the bottom of the stairs.)

ALADDIN:    Jasmine?
JASMINE:    Ali, where have you been?
ALADDIN:    There's something I've got to tell you.
JASMINE:    The whole kingdom has turned out for father's
        announcement!
ALADDIN:    No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!
JASMINE:    Good luck!  (She pushes him out onto the platform
        with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire
        crowd.)
SULTAN: ...Ali Ababwa!
ALADDIN:    Oh, boy!

(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.)

IAGO:   Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
JAFAR:  Let them cheer.

 (He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.)

GENIE:  You know Al, I'm getting (turns and sees JAFAR)
        reallyyyyyy--I don't think you're him.  (He
        descends and consults a playbill.)  Tonight, the
        role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and
        sinister ugly man.
JAFAR:  I am your master now.  (He throws GENIE to the
        ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.)
GENIE:  I was afraid of that.
JAFAR:  Genie, grant me my first wish.  I wish to rule on
        high, as sultan!!!

(Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes.
    The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.)

ALADDIN:    Whoa!
SULTAN: Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on?

(His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body
    flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer
     shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.)

JAFAR:  Heh heh heh!
SULTAN: Jafar, you vile betrayer.
IAGO:       That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
ALADDIN:    Oh, yeah?  Well, we'll just see about that!  (Pulls
        off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp!
JAFAR:  Finders-keepers, Abooboo.

(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into
    the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him.
      They fly up near the GENIE's head.)

ALADDIN:    Genie!  No!
GENIE:  Sorry, kid--I got a new master now.  (He places the
        palace on top of a mountain.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop!
JAFAR:  There's a new order now--my order!  Finally, you
        will bow to me!

(The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)

JAFAR:  We'll never bow to you!
IAGO:       Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR:  If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will
        cower before a sorcerer!  (To GENIE)  Genie, my
        second wish--I wish to be the most powerful
        sorcerer in the world!

(GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot,
    and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR,
     returning him to his normal look.)

IAGO:       Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for
        Sorcerer Jafar!
JAFAR:  Now where were we?  Ah, yes--abject humiliation!
        (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and
        they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him.
        He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty-
        cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin
        with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to
        introduce you to.
ALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her!

(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN.  CARPET flies away.)

JAFAR:  Prince Ali
    Yes, it is he,
    But not as you know him.
    Read my lips and come to grips
    With reality

(JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.)

    Yes, meet a blast from your past
    Whose lies were too good to last
    Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!

(JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO:       Or should we say Aladdin?
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I tried to tell you.

JAFAR:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
    Just a con, need I go on?
    Take it from me
    His personality flaws
    Give me adequate cause
    To send him packing on a one-way trip
    So his prospects take a terminal dip
    His assets frozen, the venue chosen
    Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!
    So long,
IAGO:       Good bye, see ya!
JAFAR:  Ex-Prince Ali!

(JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into
    a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before
    CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where
    the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop.
    ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.)

ALADDIN:    Abu?  Abu!  (He looks back at a shivering pile of
        snow.)  Oh, this is all my fault--I should have
        freed the genie when I had the chance.  (He digs
        out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.)  Abu!
        Are you okay?  I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of
        everything, somehow.  I gotta go back and set
        things right.  (He starts to walk through the snow,
        and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET.)
        Carpet!  (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by
        the pillar.  He tugs to try and free CARPET.  He
        can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the
        base of the pillar.)   Abu, start digging!  That's
        it!  (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and
        the pillar begins to roll.  ALADDIN runs away,
        looks back, then slides into place.  The pillar
        rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and
        ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by
        the window of the pillar.)  Yeah!  All right!  (He
        looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU.
        CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick
        them up.)  Now, back to Agrabah!  Let's go!

(We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds.
    Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN
    tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the
    throne.)

IAGO:       Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker.
        Shove 'em all right down your throat.  Here, have
        lots!

(JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.)

JAFAR:  Leave him alone!

(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.)

JAFAR:  It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.
        (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.)
        A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be
        on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
        (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do
        you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen...

(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)

JASMINE:    Never!
JAFAR:  I'll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he
        raises his hand to slap her.  Then he stops.)  No.
        Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.  I
        wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in
        love with me.

(We see ALADDIN race back into town.)

GENIE:  (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few
        addendas, some quid pro quo-
JAFAR:  Don't talk back to me, you stupid blue lout!  You
        will do what I order you to do, slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to
    play along.)

JASMINE:    (She stands and puts the crown on her head.)
        Jafar!  I never realized how incredibly
        handsome you are.

(The GENIE's jaw drops.)

JAFAR:  That's better.  (He pulls the GENIE's jaw up like a
        shade.)  Now, pussycat, tell me more
        about...myself.
JASMINE:    You're tall, well dressed...

(JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE
    sees them.)

GENIE:  Al!  Al, little buddy!
ALADDIN:    Shh!
GENIE:  (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.)
        Al, I can't help you--I work for senor psychopath,
        now.  (His head turns into JAFAR's, then back.)
ALADDIN:    Hey--I'm a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE's
        mouth.)  I'll improvise.

(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE.
    JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.)

JAFAR:  Go on.
JASMINE:    And your beard...is so...twisted!  (She has her
        arms around him.  She pretends to twist with her
        finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN
        to come over.  He makes his move.  IAGO sees him.)

IAGO:       Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)
JAFAR:  And the street rat?
JASMINE:    What street rat?

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR
    turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN
     looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.)

ABU:        Yuck!
JAFAR:  That was--(he sees ALADDIN's reflection in her
        crown.) You!!  How many times do I have
        to kill you, boy?

 (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the
    ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.)

ALADDIN:    Get the lamp!

(JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then
    zaps her into an hourglass.)

JAFAR:  Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!

(Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.)

ALADDIN:    Jasmine!
IAGO:       Oh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU rushes for the lamp.)

JAFAR:  Don't toy with me!  (He's zapped into a toy monkey.
ALADDIN:    Abu!


(CARPET rushes in.)

JAFAR:  Things are unraveling fast, now boy. (CARPET is
        zapped and unravels.  ALADDIN again rushes for the
        lamp.)  Get the point?  (His path is blocked by
        large swords sticking in the floor.  JAFAR grabs
        the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a
        sword out of the floor.) I'm just getting warmed
        up!  (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)
ALADDIN:    Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly
        snake?
JAFAR:  A snake, am I?  Perhaps you'd like to see how
        snake-like I can be!  (He smiles broadly, and we
        see a snake's tongue come out from behind his
        teeth.  He then turns into a giant cobra, and the
        ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the
        snake encircling ALADDIN.  The snake JAFAR makes
        moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN
        swings the sword and hits JAFAR.  Cut to GENIE
        cheerleaders wearing 'A' sweaters.)

GENIE:  Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into
        that snake!
JAFAR:  You stay out of thissss!

(GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a 'J' on it.)

GENIE:  (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't do it,
        GREAT!

(ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where
    JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path.
     ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.)

JASMINE:    Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing
    the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake
    cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and
    hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake's back
     and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to
     free the princess.)

ALADDIN:    Hang on, Jasmine!

(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.)

JAFAR:  (laughs hideously)  You little fool!  You thought
        you could defeat the most powerful being on earth!
IAGO:       (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him,
        Jafar--Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him
        out of the way)
JAFAR:  Without the genie, boy, you're nothing!
ALADDIN:    (Has an idea)  The genie!  The genie!  The genie
        has more power than you'll ever have!
JAFAR:  What!!
ALADDIN:    He gave you your power, he can take it away!
GENIE:  Al, what are you doing?  Why are you bringing me
        into this?
ALADDIN:    Face it, Jafar--you're still just second best!
JAFAR:  You're right!  His power does exceed my own!  But
        not for long!

(JAFAR circles around the GENIE.)

GENIE:  The boy is crazy.  He's a little punch drunk.  One
        too many hits with the snake  (His hand
        turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)
JAFAR:  Slave, I make my third wish!  I wish to be an all
        powerful genie!
GENIE:  (Reluctantly) All right, your wish is my command.
        Way to go, Al.

(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt.
    JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We
     see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN
    runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess
     pour out.)

JAFAR:  Yes!  Yes!  The power! The absolute power!
JASMINE:    (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
ALADDIN:    Trust me!

(A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.)

JAFAR:  The universe is mine to command, to control!
ALADDIN:    Not so fast, Jafar!  Aren't you forgetting something?
    (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you
    got it!  And everything that goes with it!

(Shackles appear on JAFAR's wrists.)

JAFAR:  No!  No!
IAGO:       I'm gettin' out of here!  Come on, you're the
        genie, I don't want--

(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.)

ALADDIN:    Phenomenal cosmic powers!  Itty bitty living space.
GENIE:  Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN
    and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of
     the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed
     because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears
     where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the
    new lamp.)

JAFAR:  (Both from inside the lamp.)  Get your blasted beak
        out of my face!
IAGO:       Oh, shut up, you moron!
JAFAR:  Don't tell me to shut up!
GENIE:  Allow me.  (He takes the lamp and goes to the
        balcony.  He is now wearing a baseball cap.  He
        winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his
        palm flat and flicks it out into the desert
        with his finger.) Ten- thousand years in a cave of
        wonders ought to chill him out!

(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks
    over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.)

ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a
        prince.
JASMINE:    I know why you did.
ALADDIN:    Well, I guess...this... is goodbye?  (GENIE pokes
        his head around the corner shocked at what he is
        hearing.)
JASMINE:    Oh, that stupid law.  This isn't fair--I love you.
GENIE:  (Wipes away a tear)  Al, no problem. You've still
        got one wish left.  Just say the word and you're a
        prince again.
ALADDIN:    But Genie, what about your freedom?
GENIE:  Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.  This is
        love.  (He leans down next to her.)  Al, you're
        not gonna find another girl like her in a million
        years.  Believe me, I know.  I've looked.
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I do love you, but I've got to stop
        pretending to be something I'm not.
JASMINE:    I understand.

(They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns
    to the GENIE.)

ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for your freedom.
GENIE:  One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.  I--what?
ALADDIN:    (He holds the lamp up to GENIE.)  Genie, you're
        free!

(A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off
    GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground.
     GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)

GENIE:  (He can't believe it.)  Heh, heh!  I'm free. I'm
        free.  (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.)  Quick,
        quick, wish for something outrageous.  Say  "I want
        the Nile."   Wish for the Nile.  Try that!
ALADDIN:    I wish for the Nile.
GENIE:  No way!!  (Laughs hysterically.  He bounces around
        the balcony like a pinball.)  Oh does that feel
        good!  I'm free!  I'm free at last!  I'm hittin'
        the road.  I'm off to see the world!  I--

(He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking
    very sad.)

ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm--I'm gonna miss you.
GENIE:  Me too, Al.  No matter what anybody says, you'll
        always be a prince to me.

(They hug.  The SULTAN steps forward.)

SULTAN: That's right.  You've certainly proven your worth
        as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the
        problem.
JASMINE:    Father?
SULTAN: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?  From this day
        forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems
        worthy.
JASMINE:    (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN's arms.)
        Him!  I choose...I choose you, Aladdin.
ALADDIN:    Ha, ha.  Call me Al.

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together.
    GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy
     hat.)

GENIE:  Oh, all of ya. Come over here.  Big group hug!
        Mind if I kiss the monkey?  (He kisses ABU.)  Ooh,
        hairball!  Well, I can't do any more damage around
        this popsicle stand.  I'm outta here!  Bye, bye,
        you two crazy lovebirds.  Hey, Rugman: ciao!  I'm
        history!   No, I'm mythology!  No, I don't care
        what I am--I'm free!

(The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles
    behind him.  They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse)
     to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see
     ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.)

ALADDIN:    A whole new world
JASMINE:        A whole new life
BOTH:   (with off-camera chorus)    For you and me!
MEN'S CHORUS:   A whole new world!

(They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared,
    the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly
    the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up
     and looks at the audience.)

GENIE:  Made ya look!

(Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon.  Fade to black.
    The end.)

[Fade from black. A tendril of purple mist in front of a wall of red flames. 
The mist forms into golden letters: "Aladdin". The letters shimmer, then blow away. 
In a desert, a short peddler rides a camel, singing through the silent night as the opening credits roll]

Peddler:

♪ Oh I come from a land, from a faraway place ♪

♪ Where the caravan camels roam ♪

♪ Where they cut off your ear, if they don't like your face ♪ / ♪ Where it's flat and immense, and the heat is intense ♪

♪ It's barbaric, but hey, it's home! ♪

♪ When the wind's from the east, and the sun's from the west, and the sand in the glass is right ♪

♪ Come on down, stop on by, hop a carpet and fly, to another Arabian night! ♪

[Over the dunes, we're shown the city of Agrabah. The castle absolutely dominates the view, while the merchant sings on, approaching the border of the city]

Peddler:

♪ Arabian nights, like Arabian days ♪

♪ More often than not, are hotter than hot ♪

♪ In a lot of good ways! ♪

[The camera pans through a city street, where a firebreather is performing his act. He breathes out flames, which transition us back to the peddler]

♪ Arabian nights, 'neath Arabian moons ♪

♪ A fool off his guard, could fall and fall hard ♪

♪ Out there on the dunes ♪

[The tired camel, panting and shaking on all of its four legs, collapses and his driver nimbly slides of its back. 
He clutches his hands as he addresses the viewer(s)]

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. (waving) Please, please, come closer.

[The camera zooms in and presses itself against the peddler's face]

Peddler: (uncomfortably) Ugh... Too close. A little too close.

[Thankfully, for all parties concerned, the camera is pulled back a bit]

Peddler: Ah, there. Welcome to Agrabah... (lights a flame) City of mystery... (clutching his camel's head) Of enchantment...

[He opens the pouch on the camel's back, which suddenly transforms into a fully decked out bazaar stall]

Peddler: And the finest merchandise this side of the river Jordan, on sale today. Come on down. Heh, heh.

[He pulls a rather conspicuous looking vase from the top of the stall]

Peddler: Look at this. Yes. Combination hookah and coffeemaker. (pressing it against a potato) Also makes julienne fries. Will not break. 
(taps it on table) Will not…

[Boing! The top end pops off]

Peddler: (deadpan) It broke. (casting it aside) Ohh! Look at this. (pulls out a box) I have never seen one of these intact before. 
This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen...

[He pries it open and, for effect, blows a raspberry]

Peddler: Ah, still good.

[It's clear now: we're not interested. The camera starts to pan away from the peddler, who hurriedly tries to catch up with us]

Peddler: (waving his hands) Wait, don’t go! (smiling) I can see that you’re only interested in the exceptionally rare. 
I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider... this.

[The peddler pulls the now iconic magic lamp out from his sleeve, gently holding it in his hands]

Peddler: Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance. Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts.

[Again, the camera pans away. The peddler doesn't give up, though, once more struggling to stay into view of his potential buyer(s)]

Peddler: (anxiously) This is no ordinary lamp! It once changed the course of a young man’s life.
A young man who, liked this lamp, was more than what he seemed. (peering around, whispering) A diamond in the rough. (smiling) 
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?

[The peddler pours shiny sand from the lamp into his hand...]

Peddler: It begins on a dark night…

[...and throws it into the sky, where it forms a starry nightscape.]

Peddler (vo): Where a dark man waits... with a dark purpose...

(The camera tilts down to a open part of the desert, where, perched above a sand mountain on top of a horse, Jafar is waiting. 
His companion, a parrot named Iago, is sitting still on his shoulder, while from the shadows, a rather disheveled man rides towards them. 
The newcomer, Gazeem, steps off his horse and looks up to the two]

Jafar: You... are late.

Gazeem: (bowing) A thousand apologies, O Patient One.

Jafar: You have it, then?

Gazeem: I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.

[He pulls out a medallion: the half of a Golden Scarab. Jafar reaches out for it, but Gazeem yanks it back]

Gazeem: Ah-ah-ahhh. (holding out his free hand) The treasure.

[Iago squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion]

Gazeem: Ow!

Jafar: Trust me, my pungent friend. You'll get what's coming to you.

Iago: What's coming to you. Awk!

(Jafar pulls out the second half of the medallion. He connects them, forming a golden scarab. It comes to life and flies away.)

Jafar: Quickly! Follow the trail!

(On horseback, the trio chase the medallion across the moonlit desert)

Jafar: Faster!

[The creature splits in two, each half lodging into a sand dune. A towering tiger's head rises from the dune. 
The pieces of the scarab form its glowing eyes. The men's horses rear on their hind legs, throwing their riders off. 
Jafar grins as the tiger head opens it cavernous mouth]

[horse neighs]

[wind howling]

Jafar: At last, after all my years of searching... the Cave of Wonders.

Iago: Awk. Cave of Wonders!

Gazeem: (whispering) By Allah...

Jafar: Now, remember. Bring me the lamp! The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp... is mine. [chuckles]

(Gazeem starts to approach the lion’s mouth, which forms the entrance to the cave. He chuckles as he goes.)

Iago: Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp. (Now that Iago and Jafar are alone, Iago opens up in normal English.) Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?

(Jafar puts his finger to his lips and shushes him. Gazeem creeps towards the oral entrance of the cave. 
He peers inside of the mouth as its tongue morphs into a staircase. 
He tip toes around one of the tiger's fangs, but is blown away by the roar of the cave’s speaking.)

Cave: [echoing rumble] Who disturbs my slumber?

Gazeem: [thief gasps] It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

Cave: Know this. Only one may enter here. One whose worth lies far within. A diamond in the rough.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look.)

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Go on.

[beast sighing]

(Gazeem hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave. With great apprehension, he plants his foot down. Nothing happens. 
Relieved, he begins his trek again. Then another roar comes. He turns back, but the lion’s mouth slams shut and the dune collapses back to normal. 
All that are left are Jafar, Iago, and the two separated halves of the medallion.)

Jafar: NOOOOOOO!

Cave: Seek thee out... the diamond in the rough...

Iago: [coughing] I can't believe it. I just don't believe it! We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp! 
Just forget it! Look at this. Look at this. I'm so tickled off that I'm molting. (He flies up to Jafar's shoulder.)

Jafar: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.

Iago: (extremely sarcastic) Oh, there's a big surprise. That's an incredi- I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise. 
What are we gonna do? We got a big problem here, a big-

[Jafar pinches his beak shut]

Jafar: Yes. Only one may enter. I must find this one, this... diamond in the rough.

(Cut to a rooftop, where Aladdin rushes up to the edge, carrying a loaf of bread. He almost drops it over the edge.)

Razoul: Stop! Thief! I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.) All this for a loaf of bread? Whoooaa!

(He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with drying clothes on them. 
He skies down them, collecting bits and pieces of clothing on him as he goes. 
Finally, he’s nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches out and slams the shutters closed. 
Aladdin slams into the shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him. 
He pulls off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread when…)

Guard 1: There he is!

Guard 2: You won't get away so easy!

Aladdin: You think that was easy?

(He looks at three women, laughing at him.)

Razoul: You two, over that way, and you, follow me. We'll find him.

(Aladdin pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise. He rushes over to the women.)

Aladdin: Morning, ladies.

Woman 1: Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?

Aladdin: Trouble? No way. You're only in trouble if you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin’s shoulder and yanks him back. It’s Razoul. Aladdin’s disguise falls off.)

Razoul: Gotcha!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (A screeching sound from Abu, then the guard’s turban is pulled down over his eyes. Abu points on the guard’s head, laughing.)

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Abu: Hello.

Aladdin: Come on. Let's get outta here. Gotta keep...

(A guard swings at Aladdin, but destroys a barrel of fish. Abu raspberries the guard, then dodges an attack. Then Aladdin pulls down the guard's pants)

♪ One jump ahead of the breadline ♪

♪ One swing ahead of the sword ♪

♪ I steal only what I can’t afford ♪ That’s everything.

(As Aladdin runs off, the guard pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants.)

♪ One jump ahead of the lawmen ♪

♪ That's all and that's no joke ♪

♪ These guys don't appreciate I'm broke! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down on top of the guards.)

Guards: (One at a time) ♪ Riffraff! ♪

♪ Street rat! ♪

♪ Scoundrel! ♪

(throw fruit at Aladdin) ♪ Take that! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Just a little snack, guys. ♪

Guards: ♪ Rip him open, take it back, guys! ♪

(Aladdin scampers to the top of a platform. The guards shake the platform back and forth trying to knock him off)

Aladdin: ♪ I can take a hint ♪

♪ Gotta face the facts ♪

(Aladdin jumps off the platform to certain death, only to grab Abu’s hands like an acrobat. The pair swing into a harem.)

♪ You're my only friend, Abu! ♪

Harem Girls: Who?

♪ Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom ♪

(Abu finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a chipmunk.)

♪ He's become a one-man rise in crime ♪

Woman 2: ♪ I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em. ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Gotta eat to live, ♪

♪ Gotta steal to eat ♪

♪ Tell you all about it when I got the time! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu exit and bounce off an awning. Cut to a muscleman flexing to a crowd. The guards rush past. 
Cut to Aladdin and Abu behind the muscleman, matching his moves, until they make a mistake and are discovered. )

♪ One jump ahead of the slowpokes. ♪

♪ One skip ahead of my doom. ♪

♪ Next time, gonna use a nom de plume. ♪

Razoul: There he is!

(A chase sequence, in which Aladdin and Abu, pursued by the guards, race through a flock of sheep, hurdle a performer sleeping on a bed of nails 
[of course one extremely large guard lands on him])

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the hitmen ♪

♪ One hit ahead of the flock ♪

♪ I think I'll take a stroll around the block ♪

(Abu disguises himself with jewels until a shopkeeper discovers him. )

Man 1: ♪ Stop, thief! ♪

Shopkeeper 1: ♪ Vandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Abu! ♪

Woman 3: ♪ Scandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Let's not be too hasty ♪

(Aladdin is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens and a large, ugly lady comes out)

Lady: ♪ Still I think he's RATHER TASTY! ♪

(Aladdin tumbles away, then puts his arm around a guard, acting like they're all chums)

Aladdin: ♪ Gotta eat to live, ♪

♪ Gotta steal to eat ♪

♪ Otherwise, we'd get along! ♪

Guards: WRONG!

(The guards leap at Aladdin, but become tangled. Their targets are sneaking away in pots)

Main Guard: Get him!

(Aladdin vaults over a performer walking harmlessly across hot coals. The guards storm through the coals, hopping up and down in pain as they burn the feet. 
Aladdin and Abu pass a sword swallower, then Abu goes back to pull the sword out of the swallower's mouth. Abu advances on the guards, who halt in fear.)

Guard: He's got a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We've all got swords!

(The guards pull out their swords. Abu sets down his sword and runs off. Aladdin and Abu are once again surrounded, with guards coming from left and right. 
He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street, as the guards all crash into each other.)

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the hoofbeats ♪

Guards: Vandal!

Aladdin: ♪ One hop ahead of the hump ♪

Guards: Street rat!

Aladdin: ♪ One trick ahead of disaster ♪

Guards: Scoundrel!

Aladdin: ♪ They're quick, but I'm much faster ♪

Guards: Take that!

(The guards chase Aladdin up a staircase into a room. He grabs a carpet...)

Aladdin: ♪ Here goes, ♪

♪ Better throw my hand in ♪

♪ Wish me happy landin', ♪

♪ All I gotta do is jump! ♪

(..and jumps out the window as if the carpet was magic. 
The guards follow him out the window, but they fall straight down to the street, 
and land in a cart of fertilizer with the sign "Crazy Hakim’s Discount Fertilizer." )

Guards: Yuck! Oy!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely and out of danger. Aladdin and Abu high-five each other)

Aladdin: And now, esteemed effendi, we feast. All right.

(Aladdin breaks the bread in two and gives half to Abu, who begins to eat. 
But Aladdin looks over and sees two young children rummaging through the garbage for food. 
The girl sees him, then drops her find and tries to hide. Aladdin looks solemnly at them, then at the bread, then at Abu.)

Abu: Yum, yum! Uh-oh.

(Abu takes a big bite of his food, but Aladdin gets up and walks over to the children. The girl pulls her brother back.)

Aladdin: [sighs] Here. Go on. Take it.

(The children giggle with delight. Abu tries to swallow his bite, then looks guilty. He walks over to the children and offers his bread to them. 
In delight, they pet him on the head.)

Abu: Ah, don’t. Huh?

(ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade going on.ALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people. 
He sees PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse.)

BYSTANDER 1: On his way to the palace, I suppose.

BYSTANDER 2: Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is startled as the two children come running out from the alley. The BOY runs out in front of the ACHMED’s horse, startling it.)

ACHMED: Out of my way, you filthy brat!

(ACHMED brings up his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN jumps in front of them and catches the whip.)

ALADDIN: Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners!

ACHMED: Oh--I teach you some manners!

(ACHMED kicks ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laugh at him.)

ALADDIN: Look at that, Abu. It’s not every day you see a horse with two rear ends!

(ACHMED stops and turns back to ALADDIN.)

ACHMED: Oh! You are a worthless street rat! You were born a street rat, you’ll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you.

(ALADDIN rushes ACHMED, but the doors to the castle slam shut in his face.)

ALADDIN: I’m not worthless. And I don’t have fleas. Come on, Abu. Let’s go home.

(ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in ABU for the night.)

ALADDIN: Riffraff, street rat. I don’t buy that. If only they’d look closer Would they see a poor boy? No siree. They’d find out, there’s so much more to me.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace.) Someday, Abu, things are gonna change. 
We’ll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all.

(Dissolve to same shot during day. Cut to int. of SULTAN’s chamber. The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, missing the rear end of his pants.)

ACHMED: I’ve never been so insulted.

SULTAN: Oh, Prince Achmed. You’re not leaving so soon, are you?

ACHMED: Good luck marrying her off.

SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! (The SULTAN goes off into the garden looking for his daughter. 
He finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE’s pet tiger, who blocks him off. RAJAH has a piece of PRINCE ACHMED’s undershorts in his mouth. 
The SULTAN grabs the cloth and yanks it out of RAJAH’s mouth.) Confound it, Rajah! So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out!

JASMINE: Oh, father. Rajah was just playing with him, weren’t you Rajah. (RAJAH comes over and allows JASMINE to pet and hug him.) 
You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren’t you? 
(She cuddles with RAJAH, enjoying the moment, until she looks up at her angry father.) Ahem.

SULTAN: Dearest, you’ve got to stop rejecting every suitor that comes to call. The law says you…

BOTH: …must be married to a prince.

(They walk over to a dove cage.)

SULTAN: By your next birthday.

JASMINE: The law is wrong.

SULTAN: You’ve only got three more days!

JASMINE: Father, I hate being forced into this. (She takes a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry, I want it to be for love.

SULTAN: Jasmine, it’s not only this law. (She hands him the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) 
I’m not going to be around forever, and I just want to make sure you’re taken care of, provided for.

JASMINE: Please try to understand. I’ve never done a thing on my own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the pond, petting the fish.) 
I’ve never had any real friends. (RAJAH looks up at her and growls.) Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he goes back to sleep.) 
I’ve never even been outside the palace walls.

SULTAN: But Jasmine, you’re a princess.

JASMINE: Then maybe I don’t want to be a princess anymore. (She splashes the water.)

SULTAN: Oooohhh! Allah forbid you should have any daughters!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second. JASMINE goes to the dove cage and yanks open the door. The birds fly off into freedom. She watches them go. 
Cut to int. of SULTAN’s chambers.)

SULTAN: I don’t know where she gets it from. Her mother wasn’t nearly so picky. (A shadow falls over him. He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.) 
Ooh, oh. Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor. I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

JAFAR: My life is but to serve you, my lord. (He bows.)

SULTAN: It’s this suitor business. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband. I’m at my wit’s-end.

IAGO: (In the parrot voice) Awk! Wit’s-end.

SULTAN: Oh, ha ha. Have a cracker, pretty Polly! (He pulls a cracker out from his pocket. IAGO looks terrified. Then the SULTAN stuffs it in Iago's mouth. 
IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it. JAFAR and the SULTAN both laugh.)

JAFAR: Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals. (IAGO glares at him.) Now then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem.

SULTAN: If anyone can help, it’s you.

JAFAR: Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.

SULTAN: Uh, my ring? But it’s been in the family for years.

JAFAR: It is necessary to find the princess a suitor. (JAFAR says the word ‘princess’ with the accent on the second syllable, "cess." 
He turns his staff with a cobra head towards the SULTAN. The eyes of the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR’s voice slows down and deepens. 
The SULTAN’s eyes get a hypnotized look.) Don’t worry. Everything will be fine.

SULTAN: Everything…will be…fine.

JAFAR: The diamond.

SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.

(The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.)

JAFAR: You are most gracious, my liege. Now run along and play with your little toys.

SULTAN: (Still hypnotized) Yes…that’ll be…pretty good.

(JAFAR and IAGO exit. We follow them. When they’re out of the room, the parrot spits out the cracker.)

IAGO: I can’t take it anymore! If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers…bam! Whack!

(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)

JAFAR: Calm yourself, Iago.

IAGO: Then I’d grab him around the head. Whack! Whack!

JAFAR: (Speaking over IAGO.) Soon, I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit.

IAGO: And then I stuff the crackers down his throat! Ha ha!

(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut. Diss. to ext. gardens at night. A shadowy figure walks through. We see it is JASMINE in disguise. 
She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it. She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.)

JASMINE: Oh, I’m sorry, Rajah. But I can’t stay here and have my life lived for me. I’ll miss you. 
(She begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH, who begins to whine and whimper.) Good bye!

(She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street ALADDIN and ABU are up to their capers again. They are on top of the awning of a fruit stand.)

ALADDIN: Okay, Abu. Go!

(ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.)

PROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd) Try this, your taste buds will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and hangs there, distracting his attention.) 
Hey, get your paws off that.

ABU: Blah blah blah!

PROPRIETOR: Why, you. Get away from here, you filthy ape.

(He grabs the melon away from ABU. But in the foreground, ALADDIN dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.)

ABU: Bye bye.

(He zings back up. The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front, where he places it on top of a stack. He looks confused, like he has just done this.)

ALADDIN: Nice goin’ Abu. Breakfast is served.

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat. We see JASMINE walking through the street.)

SHOPKEEPER 1: Pretty lady, buy a pot. No finer pot in brass or silver.

SHOPKEEPER 2: Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs! Sugar dates and pistachios!

SHOPKEEPER 3: Would the lady like a necklace. A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

(She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust into her face.)

SHOPKEEPER 4: Fresh fish! We catch ‘em, you buy ‘em!

JASMINE: I don’t think so. (She backs away, but bumps into a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his fire.) Oh, excuse me. 
(He gulps, then belches fire from his mouth. JASMINE is disgusted. He is pleased and taps his stomach. ALADDIN sees her, and a strange look comes over his face.) I’m really very sorry.

ALADDIN: (He’s obviously deeply in love with her.) Wow.

(She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head. ABU sees him and jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN’s face.)

ABU: Uh oh. Hello? Hello?

(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child reaching for a piece of fruit. She picks one up and gives it to him.)

JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here you go. (The boy runs off.)

PROPRIETOR: You’d better be able to pay for that.

JASMINE: (Mystified) Pay?

PROPRIETOR: No one steals from my cart.

JASMINE: Oh, I’m sorry sir. I don’t have any money.

PROPRIETOR: Thief.

JASMINE: Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan.

PROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

(He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to chop it off.)

JASMINE: No, no please.

(The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN’s.)

ALADDIN: Thank you kind sir. I’m so glad you’ve found her. I’ve been looking all over for you.

JASMINE: (whispering) What are you doing?

ALADDIN: (whispering back) Just play along.

PROPRIETOR: You know this girl?

ALADDIN: Sadly, yes. She is my sister. She’s a little crazy. (He circles his finger around his ear. She is shocked. The PROPRIETOR grabs him by the vest.)

PROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan.

ALADDIN: She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU is picking a pocket. He hears this, then straightens up. JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)

JASMINE: Oh, wise Sultan. How may I serve you?

ABU: Well, blah blah blah blah.

ALADDIN: Tragic, isn’t it? (He leans forward, picking up another apple from the cart with his foot.) 
But, no harm done. (Walks over to Jasmine.) Now come along sis. Time to see the doctor.

JASMINE: (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor. How are you?

ALADDIN: No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.

(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he’s stolen from the cart falls out.)

PROPRIETOR: Huh? What is it? (ABU picks up what he can carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here, you little thieves!

(Cut to int. of JAFAR’s lab. IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre contraption. At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.)

[explosion]

IAGO: (huffing and puffing) With all due respect, Your Rottenness, couldn’t we just wait for a real storm?

JAFAR: Save your breath, Iago. Faster. (He places the SULTAN’s ring in the contraption.)

IAGO: Yes, O mighty Evil One. [panting]

(IAGO runs faster. A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing into an hourglass below. The sands begin to swirl.)

JAFAR: Part, sands of time. Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave. 
(The sand in top forms the Cave of Wonders. 
It falls through into a storm, but it shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) 
Yes... Yes! There he is. My diamond in the rough.

IAGO: That’s him? That’s the clown we’ve been waitin’ for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked into the gears.)

JAFAR: Let’s have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?

(IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.)

IAGO: Swell. [coughs]

(JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with ALADDIN in it. 
Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)

[sinister laughter]

ALADDIN: Almost there.

(JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN’s arms. She stands up.)

JASMINE: I want to thank you for stopping that man.

ALADDIN: Uh, forget it. (He grabs a pole.) So, uh, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?

(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE: Is it that obvious?

ALADDIN: Well, you do kinda stand out. (He stares at her, still in love. She returns the look. 
But he realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.) I mean, uh, you don’t seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be. 
(He lays a plank between the buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned down, she vaults over his head. He looks back in surprise. 
She tosses the pole to him. Both ALADDIN’s and ABU’s eyes bulge.)

JASMINE: I’m a fast learner.

ALADDIN: Right. C’mon, this way. (They go inside the roof of a building, dodging planks and beams as they go.) Whoa. Watch your head there. Be careful.

JASMINE: Is this where you live?

ALADDIN: Yep. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.

JASMINE: Fabulous.

ALADDIN: Well, it’s not much, (he pulls back the curtain and exposes the palace) but it’s got a great view. Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

JASMINE: Oh, it’s wonderful.

ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and valets…

JASMINE: Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.

ALADDIN: It’s better than here. Always scraping for food and ducking the guards.

JASMINE: You’re not free to make your own choices.

ALADDIN: Sometimes you feel so--

JASMINE: You’re just--

BOTH: (in unison) --trapped.

(They look at each other, realizing that they’re perfect for one another. But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the look. 
He takes the apple out of ABU’s hand and rolls it down his arm into the hand of JASMINE.)

ALADDIN: So, uh, where’re you from?

JASMINE: What does it matter? I ran away, and I am not going back.

ALADDIN: Really? How come? (He takes a bite from the apple in his hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted look on his face.)

ABU: Why you...!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.)

JASMINE: My father’s forcing me to get married.

ALADDIN: That’s--that’s awful. (ABU appears from behind the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.)

JASMINE: What?

ALADDIN: Abu says that--uh--that’s not fair.

ABU: What?

JASMINE: Oh did he?

ALADDIN: Yeah, of course.

JASMINE: And does Abu have anything else to say?

ALADDIN: Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help.

ABU: Oh, boy!

JASMINE: Hmm... tell him that’s very... sweet.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until ALADDIN leans in to kiss her. He is interrupted, however, by the GUARDS, who have found them.)

GUARD: Here you are!

ALADDIN and JASMINE: They’re after me! (To each other) They’re after you?

JASMINE: My father must have sent them--

ALADDIN: Do you trust me?

JASMINE: What?

ALADDIN: Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)

JASMINE: Yes. (She takes it.)

ALADDIN: Then jump!

(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt. They try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)

GUARD: We just keep running into each other, don’t we, street rat?

(Again, the Guard’s turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are here and block the exit. 
The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and throws him in a vase. Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)
-
GUARD: It’s the dungeon for you, boy.

ALADDIN: Hey, get off of me!

JASMINE: Let go of him.

GUARD: (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we have here, men--a street mouse. (He throws her down.)

JASMINE: (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak) Unhand him, by order of the princess!

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)

GUARD: Princess Jasmine.

ALADDIN: The princess?

ABU: (peeking out from the vase) The princess?

GUARD: What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat?

JASMINE: That’s not your concern. Do as I command. Release him!

GUARD: Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from Jafar. You’ll have to take it up with him.

(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.)

JASMINE: (getting a very fed-up look) Believe me, I will.

(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers. 
He slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming in before he is finished. He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside the door frame.)

JASMINE: Jafar?

JAFAR: Oh, uh, princess.

IAGO: Awk! Jafar, I’m stuck!

JAFAR: How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his cape, hiding the door.)

JASMINE: The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.

JAFAR: Your father’s charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.

JASMINE: What was the crime?

IAGO: I can’t breathe, Jafar.

JAFAR: Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.

IAGO: If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt!

JASMINE: He didn’t kidnap me! I ran away!

JAFAR: (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear! Oh, how frightfully upsetting. Had I but known.

JASMINE: What do you mean?

JAFAR: Sadly, the boy’s sentence has already been carried out.

JASMINE: What sentence?

JAFAR: (with a sinister tone) Death. (JASMINE gasps.) By beheading.

JASMINE: No! (She collapses to the floor.)

JAFAR: I am exceedingly sorry, princess.

JASMINE: How could you? (She runs from the room crying.)

(IAGO finally makes it out through the door. He flies up and lands on JAFAR’s shoulder, coughing.)

IAGO: So, how did it go?

JAFAR: I think she took it... rather well. (They both get a sinister smile on their faces.)

(Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain. RAJAH comes over to comfort her. She pets him.)

JASMINE: It’s all my fault, Rajah. I didn’t even know his name.

(Cut to int. of dungeon. Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see ALADDIN chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN: (to himself) She was the princess. I can’t believe it. I must have sounded so stupid to her!

ABU: (from a distance) Yoo-hoo! Aladdin? Hello!

(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)

ALADDIN: Abu! Down here! Hey, c’mon--help me outta these.

(ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground. He wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an imitation of the princess.)

ALADDIN: Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it.

(ABU jumps up on ALADDIN’s shoulders and pulls a small set of tools out of his pocket, then frees ALADDIN.)

ABU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ALADDIN: Don’t worry, Abu. I’ll never see her again. I’m a street rat, remember, and there’s a law. She’s gotta marry a prince. She deserves a prince.

(ABU finally frees ALADDIN’s hands.)

ABU: Ta-da!

ALADDIN: (Rubbing his wrists) I’m a… I’m a fool.

OLD MAN: You’re only a fool if you give up, boy.

(We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU have seen before.)

ALADDIN: Who are you?

OLD MAN: A lowly prisoner like yourself. But together, perhaps we can be more.

ALADDIN: I’m listening.

OLD MAN: There is a cave, boy... a Cave of Wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I’d wager.

(Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word ’princess’ as "prin-CESS" rather than the standard pronunciation of "PRIN-cess." 
The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks his head out of JAFAR’s "old man" disguise.)

IAGO: Jafar, can ya hurry up? I’m dyin’ in here. [squawking]

ALADDIN: But the law says that only a prince can…

OLD MAN: You’ve heard of the golden rule, haven’t you? Whoever has the gold makes the rules. (He grins, showing a hideously bad mouth.) [wheezing laugh]

ALADDIN: So why would you share all this wonderful treasure with me?

OLD MAN: I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.

ALADDIN: Uh, one problem. It’s out there. We’re in here.

(The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.)

OLD MAN: Mm-mm-mm. Things aren’t always what they seem. So… do we have a deal?

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)

ABU: Oh, I don’t know.

(Cut to desert scene. We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the OLD MAN and ABU on it. Diss. to Cave of Wonders.)

[thunder crashing]

CAVE: Who disturbs my slumber?

ALADDIN: Uh, it is I, Aladdin.

CAVE: Proceed. Touch nothing but the lamp.

(The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of ALADDIN. )

OLD MAN: Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and then you shall have your reward.

ALADDIN: Come on, Abu. (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of his vest.)

[squeaking]

(ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase. He reaches the bottom and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.)

ALADDIN: Would you look at that?

ABU: [whimpering] Uh oh.

ALADDIN: Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the Sultan.

(ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.)

ALADDIN: Abu.

[whines]

(ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.)

ALADDIN: Don’t… touch… anything. We gotta find that lamp.

(They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises off the floor and begins following them. ABU gets the feeling they’re being followed.)

ABU: Huh?

(He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor. He continues, and the CARPET begins to follow again. 
Again, ABU turns back, but the CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.)

ABU: Aladdin, Aladdin.

ALADDIN: Abu, will you knock it off?

(Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet jumps to the other side. 
It reaches down with a tassel and pulls ABU’s tail. When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other side. 
This time, ABU lands in a karate stance. CARPET reaches down and plucks ABU’s hat off, then puts it on himself. 
ABU sits thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his face. ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away. 
ABU tackles ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)

[screeches]

ALADDIN: Abu, what are you, crazy?

(The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.)

ALADDIN: A magic carpet. Come on. Come on out. I'm not gonna hurt you.

(The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU’s hat and dusts it off. It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to him. 
ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN’s shoulder.)

[screeches]

ALADDIN: Hey, take it easy, Abu. He’s not gonna bite. Thanks.

(The CARPET again picks up ABU’s hat and hands it to him. ABU shakes his fist and screeches at it. CARPET begins to walk away, "sadly.")

[squeaking]

ALADDIN: Hey. Wait a minute. Don’t go. Maybe you can help us. (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies over and wraps around the pair.) 
Hey, whoa. You see, we’re trying to find this lamp. (CARPET motions for them to follow it.) I think he knows where it is.

ABU: [squeaks excitedly] [echoes]

(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant underground cavern. In the center of the room is a tall pillar, with a staircase going up to it. 
It is surrounded by water with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge. At the top of the pillar is a beam of light. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN: [whispers] Wait here.

ABU: [moaning] Oh. Huh? Oh!

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey. The outstretched paws hold a giant ruby. ABU is hypnotically drawn to it. ALADDIN climbs the stairs quickly. 
CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain to hold him back. ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN: This is it? This is what we came all the way down here to… (He looks down and sees ABU break free of CARPET’s hold and lunge toward the jewel.) 
Abu! Now!

(ABU grabs the jewel. There is a rumbling and the room begins to shake.)

CAVE VOICE: Infidels!

ABU: Uh oh.

CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure! (ABU places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel and the shrine melt into lava.) 
Now you will never again see the light of day!

ALADDIN: Whoa!

(ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he skies down until he flies into the air. The water has turned into lava. 
He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears and catches him. ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the bridge. 
He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock is exploding.)

ABU: Help, help, help!

ALADDIN: Gotcha! Whoa, Carpet, let’s move!

(Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling debris. ABU grabs ALADDIN’s head and covers his eyes.)

ALADDIN: Abu! Abu, this is no time to panic! (He pulls ABU off his head and sees they are flying into a wall.) Start panicking!

[Abu panting] [thunder cracks] [roaring]

(CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave. Finally, they emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to growl and close. 
CARPET and company are almost to the top when a boulder drops on carpet, with a clip of THX Optimizer, sending it to the floor. 
ALADDIN grabs onto the rock wall and holds on. He sees the OLD MAN at the top, within reach.)

ALADDIN: Help me out!

OLD MAN: Throw me the lamp!

ALADDIN: I can’t hold on. Give me your hand!

OLD MAN: First give me the lamp!

(ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP. He hands it up, and the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)

OLD MAN: [laughing] Yes! At last! [puts the lamp in]

[Aladdin struggles]

(ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU. But the OLD MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN’s wrist.)

ALADDIN: What are you doing?

OLD MAN: Giving you your reward! (JAFAR returns to his normal voice.) Your eternal reward. [screaming]

(He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when ABU bites him on the wrist. He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, who falls into the cave. 
OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as well. The clip ends from THX Optimizer, falling down. CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a boulder. 
It struggles to break free, then does. It races up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times, and is unconscious. 
On the surface, the cave roars one final time, then sinks back into the sand. JAFAR pulls off his disguise.) [yelling]

[roaring]

JAFAR: It’s mine! It’s all mine! I-- (He can’t find it in his pocket) Where is it? No! No...!

(Kiss fade to JASMINE’s bedroom. She is sitting on her bed, next to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.)

SULTAN: Jasmine? Oh, dearest. What’s wrong?

JASMINE: Jafar…has…done something… terrible. (She looks as if she’s been crying.)

SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we’ll set it right. Now, tell me everything.

(Cut to int. of cave. ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET. ABU tries to wake him.)

ABU: Oh, oh. Aladdin? Wake up. Aladdin.

(CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up. He awakes slowly.)

ALADDIN: Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.) We’re trapped. (Angry, shaking his fists at the entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal! 
(Calmer) Whoever he was, he’s long gone with that lamp.

ABU: Aha!

(ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Heh! Why, you hairy little thief! Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk. 
Hey, I think there’s something written here, but it’s hard to make out.

(He rubs the LAMP. Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the LAMP, and our wonderful friend, 
the GENIE comes out.)

GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! OY! Ten-thousand years will give ya such a crick in the neck! (He hangs ALADDIN on a nearby rock. 
Then he pulls his head off and spins it around, yelling as he does so. CARPET pulls a ALADDIN down.) 
Whoa! Does it feel good to be outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as a microphone.) 
Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in ALADDIN’s face.) What’s your name?

ALADDIN: Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.

GENIE: (Says his name as if he’s discovered something major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with ALADDIN’s name on it, circled by chase lights. 
The sign changes to reflect the GENIE’s upcoming line.) Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you ‘Al?’ Or maybe just ‘Din?’ 
Or how bout ‘Laddi?’ (GENIE disappears, then a dog wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like ‘Here, boy! C’mon, Laddi!’

ALADDIN: (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder than I thought.

GENIE: (Still a dog) Do you smoke? Mind if I do? (Dog poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE. ABU screeches wildly.) 
Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I didn’t singe the fur! Yo, Rugman! Haven’t seen you in a few millennia! Slap me some tassel! 
Yo! Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE. GENIE looks at ALADDIN.) Say, you’re a lot smaller than my last master. 
(Lifts his beer-gut.) Either that or I’m gettin’ bigger. Look at me from the side--do I look different to you?

ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I’m--your master?

GENIE: (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN’s hand and a mortarboard on his head.) That’s right! He can be taught!! 
What would you wish of me, (as Arnold Schwarzenegger) the ever impressive, (inside a cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with a dummy) 
often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside) but never duplicated-- (He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.) DUP.

GENIES: Duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.

GENIE: (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.) Genie Of The Lamp! (Goes into Ed Sullivan) Right here direct from the lamp, 
right here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment. Thank you!

ALADDIN: Whoa! Wish fulfillment?

GENIE: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes. (Turns into a slot machine, arm pulls down and three Genies appear in the windows.) 
That’s it--three. (Three GENIE caballeros come out of the slot.) Uno, dos, tres. (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.) No substitutions, exchanges or refunds. 
(The duck drops with the secret word "Refunds.’

ALADDIN: (To ABU) Now I know I’m dreaming.

Genie: Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here! So why don't you just ruminate whilst I illuminate the possibilities.
[Genie]
Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
Scheherazadie had a thousand tales
But master you in luck ‘cause up your sleeve
You got a brand of magic never fails!
(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes the thieves into submission.)

[Genie]
You got some power in your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
See all you gotta do is rub that lamp
And I’ll say
(Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged by GENIE. Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and explodes and fire at one of our heroes. 
Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN’s hand and rubs lamp with it.)

[Genie]
Mister Aladdin sir
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it down
You ain’t never had a friend like me
No no no!
(GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a note pad, like a waiter. )

[Genie]
Life is your restaurant And I’m your maitre’ d!
C’mon whisper what it is you want
You ain’t never had a friend like me.
(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN. Finally, he explodes into four duplicate GENIEs.)

[Genie]
Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
You’re the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you wish, it’s yours!
True dish How about a little more Baklava?
(The Genies give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfy chair (eh?) surrounded by the treasure and being fanned by women. 
The GENIE appears and fills the screen with baklava.)

[Genie]
Try some of column ‘A’
Try all of column ‘B’
I’m in the mood to help you dude
You ain’t never had a friend like me
(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top, then jumps to another column with a B on top. 
He falls off and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE. He opens his mouth, and his tongue turns into a staircase. 
A miniature GENIE dressed like a magician comes out. The mini GENIE does a little dance with the Genie's two giant hands. 
At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish him into nothing.)

[Genie]
Can your friends do this?
Do your friends do that?
Do your friends pull this out their little hat
Can your friends go poof!
Well looky here
Can your friends go Abracadabra, let ‘er rip
And then make the sucker disappear?
(The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them. 
He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball. 
He tosses the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base. 
He spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit. The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center). 
The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS, who dance around ALADDIN. Just as he begins to enjoy them, they disappear.)

[Genie]
So don’t you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
I’m here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for a charg? d’affairs!
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what you wish I really want to know
You got a wish that’s three miles long, no doubt
So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh!
(GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN. 
GENIE pulls a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN’s ear, which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.)

[Genie]
Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
I’m on the job, you big nabob
You ain’t never had a friend, never had a friend
You ain’t never had a friend, never had a friend
You ain’t never…had a… friend… like…me!
You ain’t never had a friend like me!
(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one. She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into existence. 
To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels, and a grand finale dancing number ensues, as well our Heroes dancing along as well. 
ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and zaps it away until they’re all back in the cave. 
GENIE has a neon "APPLAUSE" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that is is empty.)

GENIE: So what’ll it be, master?

ALADDIN: You’re gonna grant me any three wishes I want?

GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos

ALADDIN: Like?

GENIE: Ah, rule number one: I can’t kill anybody. (He slices his head off with his finger.) So don’t ask. 
Rule two: I can’t make anyone fall in love with anyone else. (Head turns into a big pair of lips which kiss ALADDIN.) 
You little punim, there. (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a zombie.) Rule three: I can’t bring people back from the dead. 
It’s not a pretty picture, (He grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) I don’t like doing it! (He poofs back to normal.) Other than that, you got it!

ALADDIN: (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos? You mean limitations? On wishes? 
(To ABU) Some all powerful genie--can’t even bring people back from the dead. I don’t know, Abu--he probably can’t even get us out of this cave. 
Looks like we’re gonna have to find a way out of here--

(They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of them.)

GENIE: Excuse me? Are you lookin’ at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did you bring me here? And all of a sudden, you’re walkin’ out on me? 
(Gets madder and madder) I don’t think so, not right now. You’re getting your wishes, so sit down! 
(They all get on CARPET. GENIE takes the form of a stewardess, with lots of arms pointing out the exits.) 
In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, anywhere! 
Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet. Weeee’rrrrrreee…outta here..

(The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off into the distance. Cut to int. of Sultan's chamber. 
JAFAR is there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage. If it weren’t for all your years of loyal service… 
From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded.

JAFAR: I assure you, your highness, it won’t happen again.

SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let’s put this whole messy business behind us. Please?

JAFAR: My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, princess. (He takes her hand to kiss it, but she yanks it away.)

JASMINE: At least some good will come of my being forced to marry. When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.

SULTAN: That’s nice. All settled, then. Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business, (he looks and sees Jasmine walking out) 
Jasmine? Jasmine! (He runs after her.)

JAFAR: If only I had gotten that lamp!

IAGO: (As JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of you! D’oh! 
To think--we gotta keep kissing up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives…

JAFAR: No, Iago. Only until she finds a chump husband. Then she’ll have us banished--or beheaded!

BOTH: Eeewww!

IAGO: (Has an idea) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Jafar? What if you were the chump husband?

JAFAR: (He looks at IAGO in insult) What?

IAGO: Okay, you marry the princess, all right? Then, uh, you become sultan!

JAFAR: Oh! Marry the shrew? I become sultan. The idea has merit!

IAGO: Yes, merit! Yes! And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff! (Dive bombs into the floor) Kersplat!

JAFAR: Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works!

(Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is coming in for a landing.)

GENIE: (Still as stewardess) Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs. Don’t stand until the rug has come to a complete stop. 
(As ALADDIN and ABU get off down the stairway formed by CARPET) Thank you. Good bye, good bye! Thank you! Good bye! (Back to normal) 
Well, now. How about that, Mr. doubting mustafa?

ALADDIN: Oh, you sure showed me. Now about my three wishes-

GENIE: Dost mine ears deceive me? Three? You are down by ONE, boy!

ALADDIN: Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the cave. You did that on your own.

(GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops. He turns into a sheep.)

GENIE: Well, don’t I feel just sheepish? All right, you baaaaad boy, but no more freebies.

ALADDIN: Fair deal. So, three wishes. I want them to be good. (To GENIE) What would you wish for?

(GENIE is hanging like a hammock between two trees.)

GENIE: Me? No one’s ever asked me that before. Well, in my case, ah, forget it.

ALADDIN: What? No, tell me.

GENIE: Freedom.

ALADDIN: You’re a prisoner?

GENIE: It’s all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig. (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic powers! 
(Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.) Itty bitty living space

ALADDIN: Genie, that’s terrible.

GENIE: (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free. Not have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?" 
To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world! But what am I talking about, here? 
Let’s get real here. It’s not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

ALADDIN: Why not?

GENIE: The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out. So you can guess how often that’s happened.

ALADDIN: I’ll do it. I’ll set you free.

GENIE: (Head turns into Pinocchio’s with a long nose) Uh huh, right. Whoop!

ALADDIN: No, really, I promise. (He pushes the nose back in and Genie’s head returns to normal.) 
After make my first two wishes, I’ll use my third wish to set you free. (He holds out his hand)

GENIE: Well, here’s hopin’. (Shakes ALADDIN’s hand.) All right. Let’s make some magic. (Turns into a magician.) So how ‘bout it. What is it you want most?

ALADDIN: Well, there’s this girl.

GENIE: Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and Genie's chest shows a heart with a cross through it.) Wrong. I can’t make anybody fall in love, remember?

ALADDIN: Oh, but, Genie, she’s smart and fun and…

GENIE: Pretty?

ALADDIN: Beautiful. She’s got these eyes that just… and this hair. Wow. And her smile… [sighs]

GENIE: (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.) Ami. C’est l’amour.

ALADDIN: But she’s the princess. To even have a chance, I’d have to be… Hey, can you make me a prince?

GENIE: Let’s see here. (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Chicken à la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a crown on its head) Nope. Alaskan king crab. 
(Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from "The Little Mermaid" clamped on.) Ow. I hate it when they do that. Caesar’s salad? Ah! 
(A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et Tu, Brute? No. Aha. "To make a prince." (Looks slyly at ALADDIN.) Is that an official wish? Say the words.

ALADDIN: Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!

GENIE: All right! Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.) 
First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century. These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar? No! Let’s work with me here. 
(He takes Aladdin's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is outfitted in his prince costume.) I like it, muy macho! Now, still needs something. 
What does it say to me? It says mode of transportation. Excuse me, monkey boy! Aqui, over here!

(ABU tries to cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and he flies over.)

ABU: Uh oh!

GENIE: Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with "AL" on it.) 
And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel! 
Watch out, it spits! (A door bearing the Genie's head on it opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel. He spits out the side of his mouth on cue. 
But the Genie’s not sure.) Mmm, not enough. (He snaps his fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.) Still not enough. Let’s see. What do you need? 
(The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning ABU into: a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a ‘57 Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1." 
(That one’s a guess, I don’t know cars, but judging by the tail fins, ‘nuff said.) Finally, he’s returned to normal.) 
Yes!! Esalalumbo, shimin dumbo! Whoa!! (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns into an elephant. 
CARPET struggles to get out from under ABU’s size 46 feet.) Talk about your trunk space, check this action out!

(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree. 
The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.)

ALADDIN: Abu, you look good.

GENIE: He’s got the outfit, he’s got the elephant, but we’re not through yet. Hang on to your turban, kid, cause we’re gonna make you a star!

(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks begin to explode outward. Cut to a stack of a pile of toys. (Look for the BEAST here.) 
We tilt up and see the SULTAN balancing them. He carefully balances the last piece on top, then sits back and sighs. 
JAFAR storms in, though, and the pile collapses.)

JAFAR: Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with your daughter.

IAGO: Awk! The problem with your daughter!

SULTAN: Oh, really?

JAFAR: (Unrolling a scroll) Right here. "If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her."

SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors! (He tries to stuff a cracker into Iago's mouth. IAGO backs away. The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker back.) 
How could I choose someone she hates? (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth.)

JAFAR: Not to worry, my liege. There is more. If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess must then be wed to…hmm…interesting.

SULTAN: What? Who?

JAFAR: The royal vizier! Why, that would be…me!

SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess, I’m quite sure.

JAFAR: Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord. (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the SULTAN with it.)

SULTAN: Yes…desperate measures…

JAFAR: You will order the princess to marry me.

SULTAN: I…will order…the princess…to…(the spell breaks momentarily)…but you’re so old!

JAFAR: (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry me!

SULTAN: The princess will marry…(the spell is again broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince Ali".) 
What? What is that? That music! Ha ha ha. Jafar, you must come and see this!

(We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in human form as a MAJOR.)

MARCHERS: Make way for Prince Ali!

SWORDSMEN: Say hey! It’s Prince Ali!

MAJOR: Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar, Hey you, let us through, it’s a bright new star, Oh, come, be the first on your block to meet his eye! 
Make way, here he comes, Ring bells, bang the drums. You’re gonna love this guy

(The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.) Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa! Genuflect, show some respect Down on one knee

(ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.) 
Now try your best to stay calm Brush up your Sunday Salaam And come and meet his spectacular coterie.

(IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him. The MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men up onto ABU’s trunk. 
They stand on each other’s shoulders as ALI shakes hands.) Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa! Strong as ten regular men, definitely 
He faced the galloping hordes A hundred bad guys with swords Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali!

(The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (TM) brand lightning bolt zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic wheel formation. 
The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.)

CHORUS OF MEN: (Carrying the camels) He’s got 75 golden camels!

(In pops a typical parade commentator)

HARRY: Don’t they look lovely, June?

CHORUS OF WOMEN: (On a float) Purple peacocks, he’s got 53!

(In comes another commentator.)

JUNE: (Mary Hart’s voice) Fabulous, Harry. I love the feathers.

GENIE: (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon ape proceeds down the parade) 
When it comes to exotic-type mammals Has he got a zoo I’m telling you It’s a world-class menagerie!

(GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two lines to the two children from earlier. 
We cut to a balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)

GENIE: (with ETHEL MERMAN’s voice)

GIRLS: (in counterpoint, hearts beating)

Prince Ali, handsome is he Ali Ababwa There’s no question this Ali’s alluring 
That physique, how can I speak Never ordinary, never boring Weak at the knee 
Everything about the man just plain impresses Well, get on out in that square He’s a wonder, he’s a whiz, a wonder Adjust your veil and prepare 
He’s about to pull my heart asunder To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali! And I absolutely love the way he dresses!

(JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace. She humphs it off.)

CHORUS: He’s got 95 white Persian monkeys!

(He’s got the monkeys, let’s see the monkeys!)

And to view them, he charges no fee!

(He’s generous, so generous)

He’s got slaves, he’s got servants and flunkies!

(Proud to work for him)

They bow to his whim, love serving him

They’re just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them. ABU, ALADDIN and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside. 
The SULTAN runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door. 
Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU and ALADDIN leading the way, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

CHORUS and GENIE: Prince Ali, Amorous he! Ali Ababwa!

GENIE: Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see!

And that, good people, is why

He got dolled up and dropped by

CHORUS: With 60 elephants, llamas galore

With his bears and lions

A brass band and more

With his 40 fakirs, his cooks, his bakers

His birds that warble on key

Make way for Prince Ali!

(More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU’s back on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN. JAFAR slams the door shut.)

SULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous.

ALADDIN: (Takes on a deeper voice.) Ahem. Your majesty, I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter’s hand.

SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course. I’m delighted to meet you. (He rushes over and shakes ALI’s hand.) This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He’s delighted too.

JAFAR: (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic. I’m afraid, Prince Abooboo--

ALADDIN: --Ababwa!

JAFAR: Whatever. Right. You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to--

SULTAN: …by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device. (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his mustache.) I don’t suppose I might…

ALADDIN: Why certainly, your majesty. Allow me.

(He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down. JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.)

JAFAR: Sire, I must advise against this--

SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.

(He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away. IAGO, who was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, 
repeatedly bopping the staff with his beak as he descends. 
SULTAN and CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack, flying under ABU, scaring him. 
The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.)

JAFAR: Just where did you say you were from?

ALADDIN: Oh, much farther than you’ve traveled, I’m sure. (He smiles. JAFAR does not.)

JAFAR: Try me. (Iago lands on the staff.)

SULTAN: Look out, Polly!

(They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimeters over their heads. CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)

IAGO: Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug!

(The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and crashes into a pillar. 
He crashes to the floor, and his head is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying "Have a cracker, have a cracker." 
The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Out of the way, I’m coming in to land. Jafar, watch this! (He lands.)

JAFAR: Spectacular, your highness.

SULTAN: Ooh, lovely. Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it. (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then collapses. ABU catches it.) 
This is a very impressive youth. And a prince as well. (Whispers to JAFAR) If we’re lucky, you won’t have to marry Jasmine after all.

JAFAR: I don’t trust him, sire.

SULTAN: Nonsense. One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I’m an excellent judge of character.

IAGO: Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure…not!!!

(JASMINE walks in quietly.)

SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one!

ALADDIN: And I’m pretty sure I’ll like Princess Jasmine!

JAFAR: Your highness, no. I must intercede on Jasmine’s behalf. (JASMINE hears this and gets mad.) This boy is no different than the others. 
What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?

ALADDIN: Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks JAFAR’s goatee, which springs out in all directions.) 
Just let her meet me. I will win your daughter!

JASMINE: How dare you! (They all look at her surprised.) All of you, standing around deciding my future? I am not a prize to be won! (She storms out.)

SULTAN: Oh, dear. Don’t worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to cool down. (They exit.)

JAFAR: I think it’s time to say good bye to Prince Abooboo.

(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night. We tilt down and find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)

ALADDIN: What am I going to do? Jasmine won’t even let me talk to her. I should have known I couldn’t pull off this stupid prince wish. 
(ABU struggles with his elephant paws to open a banana. He squishes it, and the banana squirts into his eye. 
He then tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the same.)

GENIE: (to carpet, playing chess) So move! (CARPET does, knocking a black piece off the board.) Hey. That’s a good move. (As Rodney Dangerfield) 
I can’t believe it--I’m losing to a rug.

ALADDIN: Genie, I need help.

GENIE: (as Jack Nicholson) All right, sparky, here’s the deal. You wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter, do ya follow me?

ALADDIN: What?

GENIE: (Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points out his words on a blackboard) Tell her the…TRUTH!!!

ALADDIN: No way! If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she’d laugh at me. (He puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.)

GENIE: A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh! (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light. GENIE comes out holding the real turban.) 
Al, all joking aside, you really oughta be yourself.

ALADDIN: Hey, that’s the last thing I want to be. Okay, I’m gonna go see her. I gotta be smooth, cool, confident. How do I look?

GENIE: (Sadly) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET. JASMINE is on her bed, sighing. RAJAH is by her side.)

ALADDIN: (From a distance) Princess Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and growls.)

JASMINE: Who’s there?

ALADDIN: It’s me--Prince Ali. Ahem--(Then he jumps to his deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.

JASMINE: I do not want to see you.

ALADDIN: No, no, please princess. Give me a chance.

(RAJAH growls and advances on him.)

JASMINE: Just leave me alone.

ALADDIN: Down kitty!

(Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.)

GENIE: So how’s our little beau doing?

(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.)

ALADDIN: C'mon, good kitty, take off and go. Down kitty. (He takes off his turban to brush RAJAH away.)

JASMINE: (She looks at him thinking as she has seen him before.) Wait, wait. Do I know you?

ALADDIN: (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no.

JASMINE: You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace.

ALADDIN: The marketplace? (A bee buzzes around his head.) I have servants that go to the marketplace for me. 
Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn’t have been me you met.

JASMINE: (She looks disappointed) No, I guess not.

BEE: (It’s the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her! She’s smart, fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything--pick a feature!

ALADDIN: Um, Princess Jasmine? You’re very…

BEE: Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!

ALADDIN: Punctual!

JASMINE: Punctual?

BEE: Sorry.

ALADDIN: Beautiful.

BEE: Nice recovery.

JASMINE: Hmm. I’m rich too, you know.

ALADDIN: Yeah!

JASMINE: The daughter of a sultan.

ALADDIN: I know.

JASMINE: A fine prize for any prince to marry.

ALADDIN: Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.

BEE: (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning!

JASMINE: Right, a prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering, peacock I’ve met!

BEE: (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday! Mayday!

JASMINE: Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away)

ALADDIN: What?

BEE: Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?

ALADDIN: (Swats at bee) Buzz off!

BEE: Okay, fine. But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into his turban)

ALADDIN: Yeah, right!

JASMINE: What!?

ALADDIN: Uh, you’re right. You aren’t just some prize to be won, (He looks disappointed.) 
You should be free to make your own choice. JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.) I’ll go now. (He steps up on the ledge and drops off.)

JASMINE: No!

ALADDIN: (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What? What?

JASMINE: (Now she’s amazed) How--how are you doing that? (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)

ALADDIN: It’s a magic carpet.

JASMINE: It’s lovely. (CARPET takes Jasmine's hand with a tassel.)

ALADDIN: You, uh, you don’t want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world.

JASMINE: Is it safe?

ALADDIN: Sure. Do you trust me?

JASMINE: (She looks at him at the saying of that all-important line) What?

ALADDIN: (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust me?

JASMINE: (lets a sly grin on her face) Yes.

(She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET. It zooms into the sky, knocking them both into sitting positions. 
The music of "A Whole New World" swells. JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking up at her questioningly. 
She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky.)

ALADDIN: I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me princess, now when did you last Let your heart decide?

(CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower. It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. She smiles.) 
I can open your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways, and under On a magic carpet ride

(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.) A whole new world! 
A new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no Or where to go Or say we’re only dreaming

(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight. CARPET flies in and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE: A whole new world A dazzling place I never knew But when I’m way up here It’s crystal clear That now I’m in a whole new world with you!

ALADDIN: Now I’m in a whole new world with you!

(They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight. It then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.)

JASMINE: Unbelievable sights Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an endless diamond sky

(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks terrified and squawks. 
CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them. 
They then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)

JASMINE: A whole new world!

ALADDIN: Don’t you dare close your eyes

JASMINE: An hundred thousand things to see

ALADDIN: Hold your breath--it gets better!

JASMINE: I’m like a shooting star, I’ve come so far I can’t go back to where I used to be!

(They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the ship’s sails are the Great Pyramids. 
They wave at a worker sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx. He smiles, but chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.)

ALADDIN: A whole new world!

JASMINE: Every turn a surprise

ALADDIN: With new horizons to pursue

JASMINE: Every moment, red-letter

(They fly alongside wild horses running. JASMINE pets one of them.)

BOTH: I’ll chase them anywhere There’s time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world That’s where we’ll be

(They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it down his arm to  JASMINE, 
who is now sure she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)

ALADDIN: A thrilling chase

JASMINE: A wondrous place

BOTH: For you and me!

(CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake. 
Fireworks burst and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.)

JASMINE: It’s all so magical.

ALADDIN: Yeah.

JASMINE: (She looks at him) It’s a shame Abu had to miss this.

ALADDIN: Nah. He hates fireworks. (CARPET looks up realizing what is happening.) He doesn’t really like flying either. 
(And now ALADDIN realizes it) That is…oh no!

JASMINE: (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the market! I knew it. Why did you lie to me?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, I’m sorry.

JASMINE: Did you think I was stupid?

ALADDIN: No!

JASMINE: That I wouldn’t figure it out?

ALADDIN: No. I mean, I hoped you wouldn’t. No, that’s not what I meant.

JASMINE: Who are you? Tell me the truth!

ALADDIN: The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on, giving up hope.) 
The truth, um... the--the truth is, I sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life. (CARPET slumps down in defeat.) 
But I really am a prince! (The feather on his turban falls down over his eyes.)

JASMINE: Why didn’t you just tell me?

ALADDIN: Well, you know, um…royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don’t you think?

JASMINE: Not that strange.

(She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him. CARPET puts a tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified. 
Dissolve to ext. of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. CARPET forms a set of steps and she descends. 
ALADDIN then descends just below the balcony.)

JASMINE: Good night, my handsome prince.

ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected. 
She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN: Yes! (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends to the ground.) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right.

(He looks up at Jasmine's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.)

ALADDIN: Hey! What? (A gag is tied around his mouth. Muffled words) Abu! Abu! (We see the elephant hanging from a net tied in a tree.)

ABU: Yes?

GUARD: Hold him!

(Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands. Another GUARD ties CARPET in a knot around a tree.)

JAFAR: I’m afraid you’ve worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo. (Walks away.) Make sure he’s never found.

(A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious. Cut to a cliff, where GUARDS laugh as Aladdin's body drops into the water. 
He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock. The rock hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out. 
He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp. However, he loses consciousness and falls to the floor. 
The lamp, unsettled by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes, and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap)

GENIE: Never fails. Get in the bath and there’s a rub at the lamp. (Squeaks the duck) Hello. (Sees unconscious ALADDIN) 
Al? Al! Kid, snap out of it! You can’t cheat on this one! I can’t help you unless you make a wish. 
You have to say "Genie I want you to save my life." Got it? Okay. C’mon Aladdin!! (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and shakes him. 
His head goes up, then falls.) I’ll take that as a yes. (Head turns into a siren.) Wooga! Wooga! (Turns into a submarine.) 
Up scope! (He babbles in something that sounds like German. On the surface, a giant water spout emerges, and lands on top of the cliff. 
ALADDIN reawakens and coughs the water out of his lungs.) Don’t you scare me like that!

ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh…(He can’t think of how to say it, so they just hug each other.) Thanks, Genie.

GENIE: Oh, Al. I’m gettin’ kind of fond of you, kid. Not that I want to pick out curtains or anything.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing her hair. The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors, hypnotized.)

SULTAN: Jasmine!

JASMINE: Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time. I’m so happy.

SULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be, Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you.

JASMINE: What?

SULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.) You will wed Jafar.

(JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.)

JAFAR: You’re speechless, I see. A fine quality in a wife.

JASMINE: I will never marry you. (She goes to the SULTAN) Father, I choose Prince Ali!

JAFAR: Prince Ali left!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.)

ALADDIN: Better check your crystal ball again, Jafar!

JASMINE: Prince Ali!

(JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.)

IAGO: How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk!

ALADDIN: Tell 'em the truth, Jafar. You tried to have me killed!

JAFAR: What? (He goes to the SULTAN) Ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness. He is obviously lying. (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN’s face.)

SULTAN: Obviously…lying.

(ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.)

JASMINE: Father, what’s wrong with you?

ALADDIN: I know what's wrong!

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches and the spell is broken for good.)

SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my!

ALADDIN: Your Highness, Jafar’s been controlling you with this! (He advances the staff)

SULTAN: What? Jafar?! You, you traitor!

(The trio advances on JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Your majesty, all of this can be explained.

SULTAN: Guards! Guards!

IAGO: Well, that’s it--we’re dead, forget about it. Just dig a grave for both of us. We’re dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN’s pocket. He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once.

JAFAR: This is not done yet, boy!

(JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket. ALADDIN sees this and rushes him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor. 
A large red cloud appears. When it is gone, so is JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find him! Search everywhere!

ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you all right?

JASMINE: Yes.

(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.)

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time. Just horrible. How will I ever- 
(He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.) Can this be true? My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? 
(She nods) Ha ha! Praise Allah! You brilliant boy, I could kiss you! I won’t--I’ll leave that to my--. You two will be wed at once! 
Yes, yes. And you’ll be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan!

ALADDIN: Sultan?

SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs! 
(ALADDIN looks concerned at this.)

(Cut to int. of JAFAR’s chambers. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO: We gotta get outta here! We gotta get-- I gotta start packing, your highness. Only essentials (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage. 
JAFAR smiles broadly.) Travel light! Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out a picture of himself and JAFAR) and how about this picture? 
I don’t know--I think I’m making a weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.) Oh, boy--he’s cracked. He’s gone nuts. 
(IAGO flies down to him and knocks on his head.) Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip! (JAFAR grabs him around the neck) Good grip!

JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin, Aladdin! He has the lamp, Iago.

IAGO: Why that miserable--

JAFAR: But you are going to relieve him of it!

IAGO: Me?

(Cut to ext. of palace. ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.)

ALADDIN: Sultan? They want me to be sultan?

(GENIE comes out of lamp)

GENIE: Huzzah! Hail the conquerin' hero! (Turns into a one-man band. He sees ALADDIN walk away with his head hung. 
He stops, scratches his head, comes up with an idea, then zooms over to ALADDIN. 
He holds up his hands like a director scoping a picture and we look through them.) 
Aladdin! You’ve just won the heart of the princess. What are you gonna do next? 
(ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away in sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs GENIE again is confused, 
then goes to him and pulls out a script labeled "Aladdin." Whispering:) Psst. Your line is, "I’m going to free the genie." Anytime.

ALADDIN: Genie... I can’t.

GENIE: Sure you can. You just go, "Geeeeenie, IIIIIII wiiiiish you free." (He grabs ALADDIN’s head and uses him as a mock ventriloquist’s dummy. 
ALADDIN pulls away.)
ALADDIN: I’m serious! Look, I’m sorry--I really am. But they wanna make me sultan--no! They wanna make Prince Ali sultan. Without you, I’m just Aladdin.

GENIE: Al, you won!

ALADDIN: Because of you! The only reason anyone thinks I’m worth anything is because of you! What if they find out I’m not really a prince? 
(Quietly) What if Jasmine finds out? I’d lose her. Genie, I-I can’t keep this up on my own! I... I can't wish you free.

GENIE: (Sarcastically) Fine, I understand. After all, you’ve lied to everyone else. 
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out. Now if you’ll excuse me, master... (He says the last word in disgust, then poofs back into the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.)

ABU: Ohhh...

ALADDIN: Genie, I’m really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the spout and raspberries him.) Well, fine! 
(He covers the LAMP with a pillow.) Then just... stay' in there! (He looks at ABU and CARPET.) What are you guys lookin' at? 
(They both leave.) Look, I... I-I'm sorr--A-Abu, I’m sorry. I didn't... wait. Come on! (He sighs.) What am I doing? Genie’s right. 
I... I-I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

JASMINE: (From a distance) Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?

ALADDIN: (Sighing while putting on his turban) Well, here goes. (He walks into the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?

(We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO in the pond. He is imitating JASMINE’s voice.)

IAGO: Ahem--Out in the menagerie, hurry.

ALADDIN: I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds. IAGO laughs wickedly, then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is panting.)

FLAMINGO: D’uh!

IAGO: Ya got a problem, pinky?! (He sweeps the bird’s feet out from under it. 
IAGO laughs gleefully as he runs into the palace and finds the lamp under the pillow.) 
Boy, Jafar’s gonna be happy to see you! (Stretches his face like JAFAR’s and imitates it.) 
Excellent work, Iago! (Normal) Ah, go on. (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale of one to ten, you... are an eleven! 
(Normal) Oh, Jafar--you’re too kind. I’m embarrassed, I’m blushing. (He flies away with the lamp.)

(Cut to the palace entrance. The SULTAN is standing on top, making an announcement to the people.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a suitor!

(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking. ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine?

JASMINE: Ali, where have you been?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, there’s something I've gotta tell you.

JASMINE: The whole kingdom has turned out for father's announcement!

ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!

JASMINE: Good luck! (She pushes him out onto the platform with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire crowd.)

SULTAN: …Ali Ababwa!

ALADDIN: Oh boy.

(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.)

IAGO: Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.

JAFAR: Let them cheer. (He lifts the lamp and rubs it. GENIE comes out.)

GENIE: You know Al, I’m getting (turns and sees JAFAR) reallyyyyyy--I don’t think you’re him. (He descends and consults a playbill.) 
Tonight, the role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.

JAFAR: I am your master now! (He throws GENIE to the ground and puts his foot on GENIE’s face.)

GENIE: I was afraid of that.

JAFAR: Genie, grant me my first wish. I wish to rule on high, as SULTAN!

(Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle. The castle shakes. The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.)

ALADDIN: Whoa!

SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What is going on? Oh my goodness, what's happening?!

JASMINE: Father!

(His turban lifts off his head. When he grabs it, his whole body flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts. 
The clothing reappears on JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Heh heh heh!

SULTAN: Jafar, you... vile betrayer.

IAGO: That’s Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

ALADDIN: Oh yeah? Well, we’ll just see about that! (Pulls off his own turban, but finds it empty) The lamp!

JAFAR: Finders-keepers, Abooboo.

(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into the clouds.. ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him. 
They fly up near the GENIE’s head.)

ALADDIN: Genie! No!

GENIE: Sorry, kid--I got a new master now. (He places the palace on top of a mountain.)

SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop!

JAFAR: Ah, but there’s a new order now... MY order! Finally, you will bow to me!

(The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)

JAFAR: We will NEVER bow to you!

IAGO: Why am I not surprised?

JAFAR: If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a SORCERER! 
(To GENIE) Genie, my second wish--I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!

ALADDIN: Genie, STOP!

(GENIE extends his finger. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot, and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt strikes JAFAR, returning him to his normal look.)

IAGO: Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar!

JAFAR: Now where were we? Ah, yes--abject humiliation! (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and they both bow to him. 
JAFAR snickers as RAJAH comes running at him. He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty-cat.) 
Down, boy! Oh, princess--(lifts her chin with his staff)--there’s someone I’m dying to introduce you to.

ALADDIN: (off-camera) Jafar! Get your hands off her!

(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN. CARPET flies away.)

JAFAR: Prince Ali Yes, it is he, But not as you know him. Read my lips and come to grips With reality

(JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.) Yes, meet a blast from your past Whose lies were too good to last Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!

(JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO: Or should we say Aladdin?

JASMINE: Ali.

ALADDIN: Jasmine...

JASMINE: What?

Aladdin: I-I tried to tell you, I'm just--

JAFAR: So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin Just a con, need I go on? Take it from me His personality flaws Give me adequate cause 
To send him packing on a one-way trip So his prospects take a terminal dip His assets frozen, the venue chosen Is the ends of the Earth, whoopeeeeeeeee! 
So looooooooooooong,

IAGO: Good bye, see ya!

JAFAR: Ex-Priiiiiiiince Aaaaaaaallllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

(JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal. He sends the two of them into a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET can get in. 
F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls. It finally comes to a stop. ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.)

ALADDIN: Abu? Abuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!

(He looks back at a shivering pile of snow.) Oh, this is all my fault--I should have freed the genie when I had the chance. 
(He digs out ABU and crads him inside his vest.) Abu! Are you okay? I’m sorry, Abu. I-I made a mess of everything... 
somehow. I gotta go back and set things right. (He starts to walk through the snow, and he eventually steps on a frozen CARPET.) 
Carpet! (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by the pillar. He tugs to try and free CARPET. 
He can’t do it, so he begins to remove snow from the base of the pillar.) Abu, start digging! That’s it! 
(Finally, enough snow has been removed, and the pillar begins to roll. ALADDIN runs away, looks back, then slides into place. 
The pillar rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by the window of the pillar.) 
Yeah! All right! (He looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU. CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick them up.) 
Now, back to Agrabah! Let’s go!

(We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. 
IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.)

IAGO: Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here’s your cracker. Shove ‘em all right down your throat. Here, have lots!

(JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.)

JASMINE: Stop it! Jafar, leave him alone!

(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.)

JAFAR: It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.) A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear? Why, with you as my queen...

(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)

JASMINE: Never!

JAFAR: I’ll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he raises his hand to slap her. Then he stops.) No. Genie... I have decided to make my final wish. I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me.

(JASMINE gasps. We see ALADDIN race back into town.)

GENIE: (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo-

JAFAR: Don’t talk back to me, you big blue lout! YOU will do what I order you to do... slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to play along.)

JASMINE: (She stands and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar! Hm, I never realized how... incredibly handsome you are.

(The GENIE’s jaw drops.)

JAFAR: Mm, that’s better. (He pulls the GENIE’s jaw up like a shade.) Now... pussycat, tell me more about…myself.

JASMINE: You’re... tall... and dark...

JAFAR: Yes?

JASMINE: Well dressed...

(JAFAR walks over to her. ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE sees them.)

GENIE: Al! Al, little buddy!

ALADDIN: Shh!

GENIE: (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.) Al, I can’t help you--I work for senor psychopath, now. (His head turns into JAFAR’s, then back.)

ALADDIN: Hey--I’m a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE’s mouth.) I’ll improvise.

(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR’s back is to ALADDIN.)

JAFAR: Go on.

JASMINE: And your beard... is so... twisted! You've stolen my heart... (She has her arms around him. 
She pretends to twist with her finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN to come over. He makes his move. IAGO sees him.)

IAGO: Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)

JAFAR: And the street rat?

JASMINE: What street rat?

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl. JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him. 
ALADDIN looks disgusted. IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.)

ABU AND IAGO: Yuck!

JAFAR: That was--(he sees ALADDIN’s reflection in her crown.) YOU! How many times do I have to kill you, boy?!

(He zaps ALADDIN. JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the ground. ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.)

ALADDIN: Get the lamp!

(JASMINE runs to it. JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then zaps her into an hourglass.)

JAFAR: No! Ah-ah-ah, princess--Your time is up!

ALADDIN: Jasmine!

(Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.)

IAGO: Ooh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU rushes for the lamp.)

JAFAR: Don’t toy with me! (He’s zapped into a toy monkey.)

ALADDIN: Abu!

(CARPET rushes in.)

JAFAR: Things are unraveling fast now, boy! (JAFAR laughs as CARPET is zapped and unravels. 
ALADDIN again rushes for the lamp.) Get the point? (His path is blocked by large swords sticking in the floor. 
JAFAR grabs the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a sword out of the floor.) I’m just getting warmed up! (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?!

JAFAR: A snake, am I? Perhaps you’d like to see how... snake-like I can be! (He grins broadly, and we see a snake’s tongue come out from behind his teeth. 
He then turns into a giant cobra, and the ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the snake encircling ALADDIN. 
The snake JAFAR makes moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR. Cut to GENIE cheerleaders wearing ‘A’ sweaters.)

GENIES: Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into that snake!

JAFAR: You stay out of thissss!

(GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a ‘J’ on it.)

GENIE: (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he’s our man. If he can’t do it, GREAT!

(ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where JASMINE is trapped. However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path. 
ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.)

JASMINE: Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing the sword on his way. 
He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and hangs outside the palace. 
ALADDIN jumps up on the snake’s back and stabs it. JAFAR screams in agony. ALADDIN again tries to free the princess.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine, hang on!

(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.)

JAFAR: (laughs hideously) You little FOOL! You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth?!

IAGO: (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him out of the way)

JAFAR: Without the genie, boy, you’re nothing!

ALADDIN: (Has an idea) The genie. The genie! The genie has more power than you’ll ever have!

JAFAR: What?!

ALADDIN: He gave you your power! He can take it away!

GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?

ALADDIN: Face it, Jafar! You’re still just... second best!

JAFAR: You’re right! His power does exceed my own. But not for long...

(JAFAR circles around the GENIE.)

GENIE: The boy is crazy. He’s a little punch drunk. One too many hits with the snake. (His hand turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)

JAFAR: Slave! I make my third wish! I wish to be... an ALL-POWERFUL GENIE!

GENIE: (Reluctantly) All right. Your wish is my command. Way to go, Al.

(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt. JAFAR’s snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie. 
We see JASMINE’s raised hand disappear under the sand. ALADDIN runs over and finally smashes the glass. Sand and Princess Jasmine pour out.)

JAFAR: Yes... Yes! The power... The absolute power!

JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What have you done?

ALADDIN: Trust me!

(A black lamp appears at JAFAR’s base. JAFAR is busy conjuring.)

JAFAR: The universe is mine to command! To CONTROL!

ALADDIN: Not so fast, Jafar! Aren't you forgetting something?

JAFAR: (looks down questioningly) Huh?

ALADDIN: You wanna be a genie? You got it!

(Shackles appear on JAFAR’s wrists.)

JAFAR: WHAT?!

ALADDIN: And everything that goes with it!

JAFAR: No! NOOOOO!

IAGO: I’m gettin' out of here!

ALADDIN: Phenomenal cosmic powers!

(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.)

IAGO: Come on, YOU'RE the genie! I don't want, I don't--!

ALADDIN: Itty bitty living space.

GENIE: Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN and RAJAH are standing together. 
RAJAH jumps up into the arms of the SULTAN, then they are all transformed. The SULTAN is crushed because of the weight of the new RAJAH. 
The palace reappears where it used to be in the city. ALADDIN is left holding the new lamp.)

JAFAR: (Both from inside the lamp.) Get your blasted beak out of my face!

IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron!

JAFAR: Don’t tell ME to shut up!

GENIE: Allow me. (He takes the lamp and goes to the balcony. He is now wearing a baseball cap. 
He winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his palm flat and flicks it out into the desert with his finger.) 
Ten thousand years in a cave of wonders ought to chill him out!

(Jafar and Iago continue to argue as they fade out. Jasmine walks over to Aladdin. They hold hands, but both look sad.)

Aladdin: Jasmine, I’m sorry I lied to you about being a prince.

Jasmine: I know why you did.

Aladdin: Well, I guess…this… is goodbye? (GENIE pokes his head around the corner shocked at what he is hearing.)

Jasmine: Oh, that stupid law. This isn’t fair! I love you.

Genie: (Wipes away a tear) Al, no problem. You’ve still got one wish left. Just say the word and you’re a prince again.

Aladdin: But Genie, what about your freedom?

Genie: Hey, it’s only an eternity of servitude. This is love. (He leans down next to her.) 
Al, you’re not gonna find another girl like her in a million years. Believe me, I know. I’ve looked.

Aladdin: Jasmine, I do love you, but... I gotta stop pretending to be something I’m not.

Jasmine: I understand.

(They take one final look into each other’s eyes, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIE.)

Aladdin: Genie, I wish for your freedom.

Genie: One bona fide prince pedigree coming up. I--what?

Aladdin: (He holds the lamp up to GENIE.) Genie, you’re free!

(A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off GENIE’s wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)

Genie: (He can’t believe it.) Heh, heh! I’m free. I’m free. (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.) Quick, quick, wish for something outrageous. 
Say "I want the Nile." Wish for the Nile. Try that!

Aladdin: I wish for the Nile.

Genie: No WAY! (Laughs hysterically. He bounces around the balcony like a pinball.) Oh, does that feel good! I’m free! I’m free at last! 
I’m hittin’ the road. I’m off to see the world! I--

(He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking very sad.)

Aladdin: Genie, I’m--I’m gonna miss you.

Genie: Me too, Al. (sniffles) No matter what anybody says... you'll always be a prince to me.

(They hug. The Sultan steps forward.)

Sultan: That’s right. You’ve certainly proven your worth as far as I’m concerned. It’s that law that’s the problem.

Jasmine: Father?

Sultan: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan? From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy.

Jasmine: (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN’s arms.) Him! I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.

Aladdin: Heh. Call me Al.

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together. Genie is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.)

Genie: Oh, all of ya. Come over here. Big group hug! Group hug, Ooh! You mind if I kiss the monkey? (He kisses Abu.) 
Ooh, hairball! Well, I can’t do any more damage around this popsicle stand. I'm... outta here! Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds! 
Hey, Rugman: ciao! I’m history! No, I’m mythology! Nah, I don’t care what I am--I’m freeee!

(The Genie flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him. 
They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see Aladdin and Jasmine flying on Carpet.)

[Aladdin]
A whole new world
[Jasmine]
A whole new life
Both:
(with off-camera chorus) For you and me!
[Men's Chorus]
A whole new world!
(They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the GENIE’s laughing face. 
Suddenly the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up and looks at the audience.)

Genie: Made ya look.

(Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon. Fade to black)


Aladdin

(Fade from black. A tendril of purple mist in front of a wall of red flames. 
-The mist forms into golden letters: "Aladdin". The letters shimmer then blow away. In a desert, a short peddler rides a camel)

Peddler: ♪ Oh I come from a land, ♪

♪ from a faraway place ♪

♪ Where the caravan camels roam ♪

♪ Where it's flat and immense, ♪

♪ And the heat is intense ♪

♪ It's barbaric, but hey, it's home! ♪

♪ When the wind's from the east, ♪

♪ And the sun's from the west, ♪

♪ And the sand in the glass is right ♪

♪ Come on down, stop on by ♪

♪ Hop a carpet and fly ♪

♪ To another Arabian night! ♪

♪ Arabian nights ♪

♪ Like Arabian days ♪

♪ More often than not ♪

♪ Are hotter than hot ♪

♪ In a lot of good ways ♪

♪ Arabian nights ♪

♪ 'neath Arabian moons ♪

♪ A fool off his guard ♪

♪ could fall and fall hard ♪

♪ out there on the dunes. ♪

(In a nighttime street, the peddler slides off his camel and addresses us)

[camel panting]

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. Please, please, come closer. 
(Camera zooms in hitting peddler in face) Too close. A little too close. 
(Pulls his face just a little further from the camera) There. Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, 
(Opens the pouch on his camel which transforms into a bazaar stall) and the finest merchandise this side of the river Jordan, on sale today. 
Come on down. Heh, heh. Look at this. Yes. Combination hookah and coffeemaker. Also makes julienne fries. Will not break. (taps it on table) will not… 
(it falls apart) It broke. Ohh! Look at this. (Pulls out Tupperware) I have never seen one of these intact before. This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. 
Listen. (Pries it open, makes raspberry sound..) Ah, still good. (Camera begins to pan to right. The peddler hurries to catch it.) Wait, don’t go! (Stop pan.) 
I can see that you’re only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this. 
(The peddler pulls the iconic magic lamp out from his sleeve.) Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance. 
Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts. (Another pan, this one slower to left. 
Again, the peddler rushes to catch up.) This is no ordinary lamp! It once changed the course of a young man’s life. 
A young man who, liked this lamp, was more than what he seemed. A diamond in the rough. Perhaps you would like to hear the tale? 
(The peddler pours shiny sand from the lamp into his hand.) 
It begins on a dark night… (The peddler throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry nightscape.) where a dark man waits with a dark purpose.

(Camera tilts down to find Jafar sitting on his horse and Iago on his shoulder. Gazeem comes riding up to the pair.)

[horse nickers]

Jafar: You are late.

Gazeem: A thousand apologies, O Patient One.

Jafar: You have it then?

Gazeem: I had to slit a few throats, but I got it. (Pulls out half of the medallion. Jafar reaches out for it, but Gazeem yanks it back.) Ah-ah-ahhh. The treasure. (Iago Iago squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion.) Ow!

Jafar: Trust me, my pungent friend. You'll get what's coming to you.

Iago: What's coming to you. Awk!

(Jafar pulls out the second half of the medallion. He connects them, forming a golden scarab. It comes to life and flies away.)

Jafar: Quickly! Follow the trail!

(On horseback, the trio chase the medallion across the moonlit desert)

Faster!

(The creature splits in two, each half lodging into a sand dune. A towering tiger's head rises from the dune. The pieces of the scarab form its glowing eyes. 
The men's horses rear on their hind legs, throwing their riders off. Jafar grins as the tiger head opens it cavernous mouth.)

[horse neighs]

[wind howling]

Jafar: At last, after all my years of searching, the Cave of Wonders.

Iago: Awk. Cave of Wonders!

Gazeem: (whispering) By Allah...

Jafar: Now, remember. Bring me the lamp! The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine. [chuckles]

(Gazeem starts to approach the lion’s mouth, which forms the entrance to the cave. He chuckles as he goes.)

Iago: Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp. (Now that Iago and Jafar are alone, Iago opens up in normal English.) Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?

(Jafar puts his finger to his lips and shushes him. Gazeem creeps towards the oral entrance of the cave. 
He peers inside of the mouth as its tongue morphs into a staircase. 
He tip toes around one of the tiger's fangs, but is blown away by the roar of the cave’s speaking.)

Cave: [echoing rumble] Who disturbs my slumber?

Gazeem: [thief gasps] It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

Cave: Mo this. Only one may enter here, one whose worth lies far within. A diamond in the rough.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look.)

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Go on.

[beast sighing]

(Gazeem hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave. With great apprehension, he plants his foot down. Nothing happens. Relieved, he begins his trek again. Then another roar comes. He turns back, but the lion’s mouth slams shut and the dune collapses back to normal. All that are left are Jafar, Iago, and the 2 separated halves of the medallion.)

Jafar: Now!

Cave: Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.

Iago: [coughing] I can't believe it. I just don't believe it! We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp! Just forget it! Look at this. Look at this. 
I'm so tickled off that I'm molting. (He flies up to Jafar's shoulder.)

Jafar: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.

Iago: (extremely sarcastic) Oh, there's a big surprise. That's an incredi- I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise. 
What are we gonna do? We got a big problem here, a big- (Jafar pinches his beak shut.)

Jafar: Yes. Only one may enter. I must find this one, this... diamond in the rough.

(Cut to a rooftop, where Aladdin rushes up to the edge, carrying a loaf of bread. He almost drops it over the edge.)

Razoul: Stop! Thief! I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.) All this for a loaf of bread? Whoooaa!

(He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with drying clothes on them. He skies down them, collecting bits and pieces of clothing on him as he goes. Finally, he’s nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches out and slams the shutters closed. Aladdin slams into the shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him. He pulls off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread when…)

Guard 1: There he is!

Guard 2: You won't get away so easy!

Aladdin: You think that was easy?

(He looks at three women, laughing at him.)

Razoul: You two, over that way, and you, follow me. We'll find him.

(Aladdin pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise. He rushes over to the women.)

Aladdin: Morning, ladies.

Woman 1: Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?

Aladdin: Trouble? Now way. You're only in trouble if you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin’s shoulder and yanks him back. It’s Razoul. Aladdin’s disguise falls off.)

Razoul: Gotcha!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (A screeching sound from Abu, then the guard’s turban is pulled down over his eyes. Abu points on the guard’s head, laughing.)

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Abu: Abu.

Aladdin: Come on. Let's get outta here. Gotta keep...

(A guard swings at Aladdin, but destroys a barrel of fish. Abu raspberries the guard, then dodges an attack. Then Aladdin pulls down the guard's pants)

♪ One jump ahead of the breadline ♪

♪ One swing ahead of the sword ♪

♪ I steal only what I can’t afford ♪ That’s everything.

(As Aladdin runs off, the guard pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants.)

♪ One jump ahead of the lawmen ♪

♪ That's all and that's now joke ♪

♪ These guys don't appreciate I'm broke! ♪

(Aladdin and Aby scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down on top of the guards.)

Guards: (One at a time) ♪ Riffraff! ♪

♪ Street rat! ♪

♪ Scoundrel! ♪

(throw fruit at Aladdin) ♪ Take that! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Just a little snack, guys. ♪

Guards: ♪ Rip him open, take it back, guys! ♪

(Aladdin scampers to the top of a platform. The guards shake the platform back and forth trying to knock him off)

Aladdin: ♪ I can take a hint ♪

♪ Gotta face the facts ♪

(Aladdin jumps off the platform to certain death, only to grab Abu’s hands like an acrobat. The pair swing into a harem.)

♪ You're my only friend, Abu! ♪

Harem Girls: Who?

♪ Oh, It's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom ♪

(Abu finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a chipmunk.)

♪ He's become a one-man rise in crime ♪

Woman 2: ♪ I'd blame parents, except he hasn't gone 'em. ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Gotta eat to live,

♪ Gotta steal to eat ♪

♪ Tell you all about it when I got the time! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu exit and bounce off an awning. Cut to a muscleman flexing to a crowd. 
The guards rush past. Cut to Aladdin and Abu behind the muscleman, matching his moves, until they make a mistake and are discovered. )

♪ One jump ahead of the slowpokes. ♪

♪ One skip ahead of my doom. ♪

♪ Next time, gonna use a nom de plume. ♪

Razoul: There he is!

(A chase sequence, in which Aladdin and Abu, pursued by the guards, race through a flock of sheep, hurdle a performer sleeping on a bed of nails [of course one extremely large guard lands on him])

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the hitmen ♪

♪ One hit ahead of the flock ♪

♪ I think I'll take a stroll around the block ♪

(Abu disguises himself with jewels until a shopkeeper discovers him. )

Man 1: ♪ Stop, thief! ♪

Shopkeeper 1: ♪ Vandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Abu! ♪

Woman 3: ♪ Scandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Let's not be too hasty ♪

(Aladdin is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens and a large, ugly lady comes out)

Lady: ♪ Still I think he's RATHER TASTY! ♪

(Aladdin tumbles away, then puts his arm around a guard, acting like they're all chums)

Aladdin: ♪ Gotta eat to live, ♪

♪ Gotta steal to eat ♪

♪ Otherwise, we'd get along! ♪

Guards: WRONG!!!

(The guards leap at Aladdin, but become tangled. Their targets are sneaking away in pots)

Main Guard: Get him!

(Aladdin vaults over a performer walking harmlessly across hot coals. The guards storm through the coals, hopping up and down in pain as they burn the feet. 
Aladdin and Abu pass a sword swallower, then Abu goes back to pull the sword out of the swallower's mouth. Abu advances on the guards, who halt in fear.)

Guard: He's got a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We've all got swords!

(The guards pull out their swords. Abu sets down his sword and runs off. Aladdin and Abu are once again surrounded, with guards coming from left and right. 
He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street, as the guards all crash into each other.)

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the hoofbeats ♪

Guards: Vandal!

Aladdin: ♪ One hop ahead of the hump ♪

Guards: Street rat!

Aladdin: ♪ One trick ahead of disaster ♪

Guards: Scoundrel!

Aladdin: ♪ They're quick, but I'm much faster ♪

Guards: Take that!

(The guards chase Aladdin up a staircase into a room. He grabs a carpet...)

Aladdin: ♪ Here goes, ♪

♪ Better throw my hand in ♪

♪ Wish me happy landin', ♪

♪ All I gotta do is jump! ♪

(..and jumps out the window as if the carpet was magic. The guards follow him out the window, but they fall straight down to the street, and land in a cart of fertilizer with the sign "Crazy Hakim’s Discount Fertilizer." )

Guards: Yuck! Oy!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely and out of danger. Aladdin and Abu high-five each other)

Aladdin: And now, esteemed effendi, we feast. All right.

(Aladdin breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU, who begins to eat. 
But Aladdin looks over and sees two young children rummaging through the garbage for food. 
The girl sees him, then drops her find and tries to hide. Aladdin looks solemnly at them, then at the bread, then at Abu.)

Abu: Yum, yum! Uh-oh.

(Abu takes a big bite of his food, but Aladdin gets up and walks over to the children. The girl pulls her brother back.)

Aladdin: [sighs] Here. Go on. Take it.

[giggling]

[groans]

Abu: Ah, don't. Huh?

Man: On his way to the palace, I suppose. Another suitor for the princess.

[giggling]

[woman screams]

[whinnying]

Prince Achmed: Out of my way, you filthy brats.

Aladdin: Hey! If I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners.

Prince Achmed: Oh. I'll teach you some manners!

[men laugh]

[grimacing]

Aladdin: Look at that, Abu. It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends.

Crowd: Ooh!

Prince Achmed: Ha! You are a worthless street rat. You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you.

Aladdin: I'm not worthless. And I don't have fleas. [sighs] Come on, Abu. Let's go home. 
♪ Riffraff, street rat. I don't buy that. If only they'd look closer. Would they see a poor boy? No siree. They'd find out there's so much more to me. ♪ 
Some day, Abu, things are gonna change. We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all.

[roosters crowing]

Prince Achmed: I've never been so insulted.

Sultan: Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you?

Prince Achmed: Good luck marrying her off.

Sultan: Oh! Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine!

[snarling]

Sultan: Confound it, Rajah. So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out.

Jasmine: Oh, Father. Rajah was just playing with him. 
Weren't you, Rajah? You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you?

[both laughing]

[clears throat]

Sultan: Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call. The law says...

Both: You must be married to a prince...

Sultan: By your next birthday.

Jasmine: The law is wrong.

Sultan: You've only got three more days.

Jasmine: Father, I hate being forced into this. If I do marry, I want it to be for love.

Sultan: Jasmine... it's not only this law. I'm not going to be around forever, and, well, I... I just want to make sure you're taken care of. Provided for.

Jasmine: Please try to understand. I've never done a thing on my own. I've never had any real friends.

[grumbles]

Jasmine: Except you, Rajah. I've never even been outside the palace walls.

Sultan: But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

Jasmine: Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore.

Sultan: Oooh! I... I... Allah forbid you should have any daughters.

Rajah: Hmm?

Sultan: I don't know where she gets it from. Her mother wasn't so picky. Oh! Ah, Jafar. My most trusted advisor. I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

Jafar: My life is but to serve to you, my lord.

Sultan: It's the suitor business. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband. I'm at my wit's end.

Iago: Awk! Wit's end!

Sultan: [laughing] Oh! Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

Jafar: [Jafar laughs] Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.

[Iago grumbles]

Jafar: Now, then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem.

Sultan: If anyone can help, it's you.

Jafar: But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.

Sultan: Oh. Uh, my ring? But it's been in the family for years.

Jafar: It is necessary to find the princess a suitor. Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

Sultan: Everything will be... fine.

Jafar: The diamond.

Sultan: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.

Jafar: You are most gracious, my liege. Now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm?

Sultan: Yes. That will be pretty good.

Iago: [spits, coughs] I can't take it anymore! If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers... Bam! Whack!

Jafar: Calm yourself, Iago.

Iago: Then I'd grab him around the head. Whack!

Jafar: Soon I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit.

Iago: And then I stuff the crackers down his throat. Ha, ha!

[whining]

Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me. I'll miss you.

[whimpers]

Jasmine: Goodbye.

[vendors calling out]

Aladdin: Okay, Abu. Go.

Melon Merchant: Try this. Your taste buds will dance and sing.

[squeaking]

Melon Merchant: Get your paws off that.

[taunting]

Melon Merchant: Why, you... Get away from here, you cursed, filthy ape!

Abu: Goodbye.

Aladdin: Nice going, Abu.

[cooing]

Aladdin: Breakfast is served.

Pot Merchant: Pretty lady, buy a pot. No finer pot in brass of silver.

Nut Merchant: Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs. Sugar dates and pistachios.

Necklace Merchant: Would the lady like a necklace? A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

Fish Merchant: Fresh fish! We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

Jasmine: Oh, now. I don't think so. Oh!

[gulping]

Jasmine: Excuse me.

[gulps]

[belches]

Jasmine: I'm really very sorry.

Aladdin: Wow.

Abu: Uh-oh. Hello? Hello?

Jasmine: Oh, you must be hungry. Here you go.

Apple Merchant: You'd better be able to pay for that.

Jasmine: Pay?

Apple Merchant: Now one steals from my cart.

Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money.

Apple Merchant: Thief!

Jasmine: Please... If you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan.

Apple Merchant: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

Jasmine: Now! Now, please!

Aladdin: Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found her. I've been looking all over for you.

Jasmine: What are you doing?

Aladdin: Just play along.

Apple Merchant: You, uh, now this girl?

Aladdin: Sadly, yes. She is my sister. She's a little crazy.

Apple Merchant: She said she knew the Sultan.

Aladdin: She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

Jasmine: O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

[gibberish]

Aladdin: Tragic, isn't it? But no harm done. Now, come along, sis. Time to go see the doctor.

Jasmine: Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?

Aladdin: Now, now, now. Not that one. Come on, Sultan.

[gibbering, gasping]

Apple Merchant: Huh? What? Come back here, you little thieves!

[explosion]

Iago: With all due respect, Your Rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

Jafar: Save your breath, Iago. Faster.

Iago: Yes, O mighty Evil One. [panting]

Jafar: Part, sands of time. Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave. Yes! Yes! There he is. My diamond in the rough.

Iago: That's him? That's the clown we've been waitin' for?

Jafar: Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?

Iago: Swell. [coughs]

[sinister laughter]

Aladdin: Almost there.

Jasmine: I want to thank you for stopping that man.

Aladdin: Uh, forget it. So, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?

Jasmine: Is it that obvious?

Aladdin: Well, you do kind of stand out. I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.

Jasmine: Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

Abu: Wow.

Aladdin: [chuckling] Hey. Come on. This way. Whoa. Watch your head there. Be careful.

Jasmine: Is this where you live?

Aladdin: Yep. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.

Jasmine: That sounds fabulous.

Aladdin: Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view. Wow. The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

Jasmine: Oh, it's wonderful.

Aladdin: I wonder what it would be like to live here, and have servants and valets.

Jasmine: Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.

Aladdin: It's better than here. You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards.

Jasmine: You're not free to make your own choices.

Aladdin: Sometimes you feel so...

Jasmine: You're just...

Both: ...trapped.

Aladdin: [clears throat] So, where are you from?

Jasmine: What does it matter? I ran away and I am not going back.

Aladdin: Really? How come?

Abu: Why, you...

Jasmine: My father's forcing me to get married.

Aladdin: That's... that's awful. Abu!

[angry squeaking]

Jasmine: What?

Aladdin: Abu says, uh... that's not fair.

Abu: What?

Jasmine: Oh, did he?

Aladdin: Yeah, of course.

Jasmine: And does Abu have anything else to say?

Aladdin: Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help.

Abu: Oh, boy.

Jasmine: Hmm. Tell him that's very sweet.

Razoul: Here you are.

Both: They're after me! You?

Jasmine: My father must have sent them...

Aladdin: Do you trust me?

Jasmine: What?

Aladdin: Do you trust me?

Jasmine: Yes...

Aladdin: Then jump!

Razoul: We just keep running to each other, don't we, street rat?

Aladdin: Run! Go! Get out of here!

Razoul: Get this thing off of me! It's the dungeon for you, boy.

Aladdin: Get off me.

Jasmine: Let him go.

Razoul: Lookie here, men. A street mouse!

[guards laugh]

Jasmine: Unhand him, by order of the princess.

Razoul: Princess Jasmine.

Aladdin: The princess?

Abu: Princess?

Razoul: What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat.

Jasmine: That's not your concern. Do as I command. Release him.

Razoul: I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar. You'll have to take it up with him.

Jasmine: Believe me, I will. Jafar?

Jafar: Oh, Princess.

Iago: Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

Jafar: How may I be of service to you?

Jasmine: The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.

Jafar: Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.

Jasmine: What was his crime?

Iago: I can't breathe, Jafar.

Jafar: Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.

Iago: If you could just... Aah! That hurt!

Jasmine: He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

Jafar: Oh, dear. Oh, how frightfully upsetting. Had but I known...

Jasmine: What do you mean?

Jafar: Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.

Jasmine: What sentence?

Jafar: Death.

[Jasmine gasps]

Jafar: By beheading.

Jasmine: Now.

Jafar: I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

Jasmine: How could you? [weeping]

Iago: [coughing] [coughing, gasping] So, how did it go?

Jafar: I think she took it, rather well.

Jasmine: [Jasmine crying] It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his name.

[Rajah murmuring]

Aladdin: She was the princess. I can't believe it. I must have sounded stupid to her.

Abu: Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Hello!

Aladdin: Abu. Down here.

[squeaking]

Aladdin: Come on, help me out of these.

[scolding]

Aladdin: Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it.

Abu: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Aladdin: Don't worry. I'll never see her again. I'm a street rat, remember? And there's a law. She's gotta marry a prince. She deserves a prince.

Abu: Ta-da!

Aladdin: I'm a fool.

Old Man Jafar: You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

Aladdin: Who are you?

Old Man Jafar: A lowly prisoner, like yourself. But together, perhaps we can be more.

Aladdin: I'm listening.

Old Man Jafar: There is a cave, boy, a Cave of Wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams...

Abu: Ooh!

Old Man Jafar: Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager.

Iago: Jafar, can you hurry up? I'm dyin' in here. [squawking as Jafar hits him]

Aladdin: But the law says that only a prince can...

Old Man Jafar: You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you? Whoever has the gold makes the rules. [wheezing laugh]

Aladdin: So. Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?

Old Man Jafar: I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.

Aladdin: Uh, one problem. It's out there. We're in here.

Old Man Jafar: Uh-uh. Things aren't always what they seem. So, do we have a deal?

Abu: Oh, I don't know.

[thunder crashing]

Cave: And. Who disturbs my slumber?

Aladdin: Uh, it is I, Aladdin.

Cave: Proceed. Touch nothing but the lamp.

Old Man Jafar: Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and then you shall have your reward.

Aladdin: Come on, Abu.

[squeaking]

Aladdin: Would you look at that!

[whimpering]

Aladdin: Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the Sultan. Abu!

[whines]

Aladdin: Don't... touch... anything. We gotta find that lamp.

Abu: [grumbles] Huh? Aladdin!

Aladdin: Abu, will you knock it off?

[screeches]

Aladdin: Abu, what are you, crazy? A magic carpet. Come on. Come on out. We're not gonna hurt you.

[screeches]

Aladdin: Hey, take it easy, Abu. He's not gonna bite. Thanks.

[squeaking]

Aladdin: Hey. Wait a minute. Don't go. Maybe you can help us. Hey! Whoa! You see, we're trying to find this lamp. I think he knows where it is.

[squeaks excitedly]

[echoes]

Aladdin: [whispers] Wait here.

Abu: [moaning] Oh!

Aladdin: This is it. This is what we came all the way down here to... Abu! Now!

Cave: Infidels!

Abu: Uh-oh.

Cave: You have touched the forbidden treasure! Now you will never again see the light of day!

Aladdin: Whoa!

Abu: Help! Help! Help!

Aladdin: Gotcha! Whoa. Carpet, let's move. Abu! Abu, this is now time to panic. Start panicking.

Both: Whoa!

[Abu panting]

[thunder cracks]

[roaring]

Aladdin: Help me out.

Old Man Jafar: Throw me the lamp.

Aladdin: I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

Old Man Jafar: First give me the lamp. [maniacal laughter] Yes! At last! [wicked laughter]

Aladdin: [Aladdin struggles] What are you doing?

Old Man Jafar: Giving you your reward. [Old Man Jafar's voice returns to Jafar's normal voice] Your eternal reward. [Abu then bites his hand, he then screams]

[yelling]

[roaring as the Cave collapses]

Jafar: [chuckling] It's mine. [takes off his disguise] It's all mine. I... Where is it? Now... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!!!!

Sultan: Jasmine? Oh, dearest. What's wrong?

Jasmine: [sniffling] Jafar has... done something terrible.

Sultan: There, there, my dear. We'll set it right. Now, tell me everything.

Abu: Oh. Aladdin. Wake up. Aladdin.

Aladdin: Oh! My head. We're trapped. That two-faced son of a jackal! [snarling] Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.

Abu: Aha!

Aladdin: [chuckling] Why, you hairy little thief. Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk. 
Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out.

Genie: Whoa! Oy! 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck. Hang on a second. Whoa! WOW!!! Does it feel good to be outta there. 
I‘m Telling you, Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi. Where you from? What's your name?

Aladdin: Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

Genie: Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you "Al"? Or maybe just "Din." How about "Laddie"? 
Sounds like, "Here, boy. C'mon, Laddie." 
Aladdin: I must have hit my head harder than I thought.

Genie: Do you smoke? Mind if I do? [giggling] Oh, sorry, Cheetah. Hope I didn't singe the fur. Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you in a few millennia. 
Give me some tass-el. Yeah. Yo, yo. Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master. Either that or I'm gettin' bigger. Look from the side. 
Do I look different to you?

Aladdin: Wait a minute. I'm your master?

Genie: That's right. He can be taught. What would you wish for me? The ever impressive, the long contained, often imitated, but never duplicated... [echoing] 
Duplicated, duplicated... Genie... of the Lamp! Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your very much wish fulfillment. Thank you.

Aladdin: Whoa. Wish fulfillment?

Genie: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes. That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres. Now substitutions, exchanges or refunds.

Aladdin: Now I know I'm dreaming.

Genie: Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here! So why don't you just ruminate whilst I illuminate the possibilities. ♪

[Carpet applause]

Abu: [chattering] Huh? [groans]

Genie: So, what'll be, Master?

Aladdin: You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want, right?

Genie: Ah, almost. There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos.

Aladdin: Like?

Genie: Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody. So don't ask. Rule number two! I can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else. Mwah! 
You little punim there. Rule number three! I can't bring people back from the dead. It's not a pretty picture. 
I don't like doing it!! Other than that, you got it.

Aladdin: Hmm.

Abu: Oh!

Aladdin: Provisos? You mean limitations? On wishes? Some all-powerful genie. Can't even bring people back from the dead. 
I don't know, Abu. He probably can't even get us out of this cave. Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out.

Genie: Excuse me? Are you lookin' at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up? Did you bring me here? And all of a sudden, you're walking out on me? 
I don't think so, not right now. You're gettin' your wishes, so SIT DOWN!!!

[Abu screeches]

Genie: In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere. Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet. We're... outta here!

Sultan: Jafar, this is an outrage. If it weren't for all your years of loyal service... 
From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded.

Jafar: I assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again.

Sultan: Jasmine... Jafar. Now, let's put this whole messy business behind us. Please.

Jafar: My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, Princess.

Jasmine: At least some good will come of my being forced to marry. When I am a queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.

[Jafar chuckles nervously]

Sultan: That's nice. All settled, then. Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business... Jasmine? Jasmine!

Jafar: [growls] If only I had gotten that lamp!

Iago: [imitates Jasmine] "I will have the power to get rid of you." [growling, returns to his normal voice] 
To think we gotta keep kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives...

Jafar: Now, Iago. Only until she finds a chump husband. Then she'll have us banished. Or beheaded.

Both: Eeek..

Iago: Oh. Wait a minute! Jafar! What if you were the chump husband?

Jafar: What?
-
Iago: Okay, you marry the princess, all right? And, uh, then you become the sultan!

Jafar: Oh... Marry the shrew... I become the sultan... The idea has merit.

Iago: Yes, merit! Yes! And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff. Yeaaah! Kersplat!

Jafar: [wicked laughter] I love the way your foul little mind works.

[both laugh maniacally]

Genie: Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs. Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop. 
Thank you. Goodbye now. Good-ye. Thank you. Goodbye. Well, how about that, Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

Aladdin: Oh, you sure showed me. Now, about my three wishes.

Genie: Dost mine ears deceive me? Three? You are down by ONE, boy!

Aladdin: Ah, now. I never actually wished to get out of the cave. You did that on your own.

Genie: [jaw drops] Well, I feel sheepish. All right, you baaad boy, but now more freebies.

Aladdin: Fair deal. So, three wishes. I want them to be good. What would you wish for?

Genie: Me? Now one's ever asked me that before. Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Now, I can't. I...

Aladdin: Come in. Tell me.

Genie: Freedom.

Aladdin: You're a prisoner?

Genie: It's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig. Phenomenal cosmic powers... Itty bitty living space.

Aladdin: Genie, that's terrible.

Genie: But, oh, to be free. Not have to go, "Poof. What do you need? Poof. What do you need? Poof. What do you need?" 
To be my own master. Such a thing would be grater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world! But what am I talking about? 
Let's get real here. It's not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

Aladdin: Why not?

Genie: The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out. So you can guess how often that's happened.

Aladdin: I'll do it. I'll set you free.

Genie: Uh-huh, yeah, right.

Aladdin: Now, really, I promise. After I make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free.

Genie: Well, here's hopin'. All right. Let's make some magic! So how 'bout it? What is it you want most?

Aladdin: Well, there's this girl.

Genie: Wrong. I can't make anybody fall in love, remember?

Aladdin: Oh, but, Genie, she's smart and fun and...

Genie: Pretty?

Aladdin: Beautiful. She's got these eyes that just, and this hair. Wow. And her smile... [sighs]

Genie: Ami... C'est l'amour.

Aladdin: But she's the princess. To even have a chance, I'd have to be... Hey, can you make me a prince?

Genie: Let's see here. Chicken à la king? Nope. Alaskan king crab. Ow! I hate it when they do that. Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? Now! 
Aha! "To make a prince." Is that an official wish? Say the magic words.

Aladdin: Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince.

Genie: All right! Yo, yo! Woof! Woof! First, that fez-and-vest combo is much too third century. These patches. What are we trying to say, beggar? 
Now. Let's work with me here. Ooh. I like it. Muy macho. Now, it still needs something. What does it say to me? It says mode of transportation. 
Excuse me, monkey boy. Aqui. Over here.

Abu: Uh-oh.

Genie: Here he comes. What better way to make your entrance on the streets of Agrabah then riding your very own brand-new camel. Watch out. 
They spit. Mmm. Not enough. Still not enough. Let's see. What do you need? What do you need? Yes! Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo. Whoa!

Genie: Talk about your trunk space. Check this action out.

Genie: He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant. But we're not through yet! Hang on to your turban, kid! We're gonna make you a star!

[door opens]

Jafar: Sire, I've found a solution to the problem with your daughter.

Iago: Awk. The problem with your daughter.

Sultan: Oh, really?

Jafar: Right here. "If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her."

Sultan: But Jasmine hated all those suitors. How could I choose someone she hates?

Jafar: Not to worry, my liege. There is more. "If in the event a suitable prince cannot be found,"

Sultan: Jerk.

Jafar: "a princess must then be wed to..." Hmm... Interesting...

Sultan: What? Who?

Jafar: The royal vizier. Why, that would be... me.

Sultan: But I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess. I'm quite sure that...

Jafar: Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.

Sultan: Yes. Desperate measures.

Jafar: You will order the princess to marry me.

Sultan: I will order... the princess... to... But you're so old.

Jafar: The princess will mary me!!

Sultan: The princess will marry...

[trumpet fanfare]

Sultan: What? What is that? That music. [chuckling] Jafar, you must come and see this.

Jafar: Ecstatic. I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...

Aladdin: Ababwa.

Jafar: Whatever. You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to...

Sultan: By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device. Ooh. I don't suppose I might...

Sultan: That was lovely. Yes, I do see to have a knack for it. This is a very impressive youth. And a prince besides. 
[whispers] If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.

Jafar: I don't trust him, Sire.

Sultan: Nonsense. One thing, I pride myself on, Jafar, I'm an excellent judge of character.

Iago: Oh, excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!

Sultan: Jasmine will like this one.

Aladdin: And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.

Jafar: Your Highness, now. I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf. This boy is no different from the others. What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?

Aladdin: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa. Just let her meet me. I will win your daughter.

Jasmine: How dare you. All of you. Standing around deciding my future? I am not a prize to be won.

Sultan: Oh, dear. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

Jafar: I think it's time to say good-bye to Prince Abooboo.

Aladdin: [Aladdin sighs] What am I gonna do? Jasmine won't even let me talk to her. I should've known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.

[growling]

Genie: So move. Hey. That's a good move. I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

Aladdin: Genie, I need help.

Genie: All right, Sparky, here's the deal. If you wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter. Do you got it?

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Tell her the truth!

Aladdin: No way. If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.

Genie: A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh. Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.

Aladdin: Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be. Okay, I'm gonna go see her. I just... I gotta be smooth, cool, confident. How do I look?

Genie: Like a prince.

Aladdin: The marketplace? I have servants who go to the marketplace for me. Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants. 
So. I couldn't have been me you met.

Jasmine: No. I guess not.

Genie: Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her. She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything. Pick a feature.

Jasmine: Why didn't you just tell me?

Aladdin: Well, you know... royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think?

Jasmine: Prince Ali!

Iago: How in the... uh. Awk!

Aladdin: Tell him the truth, Jafar. You tried to have me killed.

Jafar: What? Ridiculous, nonsense, Your Highness. He is obviously lying.

Sultan: Obviously lying.

Jasmine: Father, what's wrong with you?

Aladdin: I know what's wrong.

Sultan: Oh, my!

Aladdin: Your Highness. Jafar's been controlling you with this.

Sultan: [stammering] What? Jafar? You, you traitor!

Jafar: Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

Sultan: Guards! Guards!

Iago: Well, that's it. We're dead. Forget it. Just dig a grave for both of us. We're dead.

Sultan: Arrest Jafar at once.

[struggling]

Jafar: This is not done yet, boy. [laughing]

[coughing]

Sultan: Find him! Search everywhere!

Aladdin: Jasmine, are you all right?

Jasmine: Yes.

Sultan: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time. This is horrible, just horrible. How will I ever... Huh? 
Can this be true? My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? Ha, ha! Praise Allah! You brilliant boy, I could kiss you. I won't. I'll leave that to my... 
But you two will be wed at once. Yes, yes. And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then you, my boy, will become sultan.

Aladdin: Sultan?

Sultan: Yes. A fine upstanding youth such as yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom means.

Iago: We gotta get outta here. We gotta get out. I gotta start packing Your Highness. Only essentials. 
We gotta travel light and bring the guns, the weapons, the knifes, and how about this picture? I don't know i think I'm making a weird face in it.

[laughing maniacally]

Iago: Oh, boy. He's cracked. He's gone nuts. Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip! Good grip.

Jafar: Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin, Aladdin. He has the lamp, Iago.

Iago: Why, that miserable...

Jafar: But you are going to relieve him of it.

Iago: Me?

Aladdin: Sultan? They want me to be Sultan?

Genie: Huzzah! ♪ Hail the conquering hero! ♪ [♪ Stars and Stripes Forever plays] Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess. What are you gonna do next?

[sighs deeply]

Genie: [whispering] Psst. Your line is, "I'm going to free the genie." Anytime.

Aladdin: Genie, I can't.

Genie: Sure you can. You just go, "Genie, I wish you free."

Aladdin: I'm serious! Look, I'm sorry. I really am! But they wanna make me sultan. No. They wanna make Prince Ali sultan. Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

Genie: Al, you won.

Aladdin: Because of you! The only reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you! What if they find out I'm not really a prince? 
What if Jasmine finds out? I'd lose her. Genie, I can't keep this up on my own. I can't wish you free.

Genie: Fine. I understand. After all. You've lied to everyone else. Hey, I was beginning to feel left out. Now, if you'll excuse me, Master.

[sighing]

Aladdin: Genie, I'm really sorry.

[raspberry]

Aladdin: Well, fine! Then just... stay in there! What are you guys looking at?

[whimpering, sniffling]

Aladdin: Look, I... I'm sorry. Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't... Wait. Come on. [sighing] What am I doing? [sighs] Genie's right. I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

Jasmine: Ali. Oh, Ali. Will you come here?

Aladdin: [sighing] Well, here goes. Jasmine? Where are you?

Iago: [imitates Jasmine] Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

Aladdin: I'm coming.

[panting]

[wicked laughter]

[goofy chuckle]

Iago: You got a problem, Pinky? Jerk. [gleeful cackling] Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you. [imitates Jafar] Excellent work, Iago. Ah, go on. 
[imitating Jafar] No, really. On a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven. Oh, Jafar, you're too kind. I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

Sultan: People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor.

[crowd cheering]

Aladdin: Jasmine.

Jasmine: Ali, where have you been?

Aladdin: Jasmine, there's something I got to tell you.

Jasmine: The whole kingdom's turned out for Father's announcement.

Aladdin: No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please. You don't understand...

Jasmine: Good luck.

Sultan: Ali Ababwa!

[cheering]

Aladdin: Oh, boy.

[cheering]

Iago: Now, Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak!

Jafar: Let them cheer...

Genie: You know, Al, I'm getting really...! I don't think you're him. Tonight, the part of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.

Jafar: I am your master now!

Genie: I was afraid of that.

Jafar: Genie, grant me my first wish. I wish to rule on high as sultan!

Aladdin: Whoa!

Sultan: Bless my soul. What is this? What? What is this? What's going on? Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

Jasmine: Father!

Jafar [cackling] (Jafar Transforms into a Sultan)

Sultan: Jafar, you vile betrayer!

Iago: That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you!

Aladdin: Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that. [gasps] The lamp.

Jafar: [Jafar laughs] Finders keepers, Abooboo.

[whistles]

[people screaming]

Aladdin: Genie, now!

Genie: Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.

Sultan: Jafar, I order you to stop.

Jafar: Ah, but there's a new order now. My order. Finally, you will bow to me!

Jasmine: We will never bow to you!

Iago: Why am I not surprised?!

Jafar: If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer!! Genie, my second wish... I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!

[Jafar laughs maniacally]

Aladdin: Genie, stop!

(The Genie Transforms Jafar from Sultan into A Sorcerer)

Iago: Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar!

Jafar: (Turns into a Sorcerer and Gets a New Snake Staff)

Jafar: Now, where were we? Ah, yes. Abject humiliation! [Rajah charges at him] Down, boy. [reduces Rajah to a kitten]

[Rajah meows]

Jafar: Oh, Princess! There's someone I'm dying to to introduce you to!

Aladdin: Jafar! Get your hands off her!

Yes, meet a blast from your past, whose lies were too good to last! Say hello to your precious Ali! ♪

Iago: Or should we say Aladdin?

Jasmine: Ali?

Aladdin: Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just...

Aladdin: [shivering] Abu. Abu!

[Abu whimpering]

Aladdin: Oh, this is all my fault. I should have freed the genie when I had the chance. Abu. Are you okay?

Abu: [teeth chattering] Mm-hmm.

Aladdin: I'm sorry, Abu. I made a mess of everything. Somehow... I gotta go back and set things right. Carpet.

[Abu chitters]

Aladdin: [Aladdin strains] Abu, start digging.

[frantic panting]

Aladdin: That's it. Yeah! All right!

[whines]

Aladdin: Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

Iago: Puppet want a cracker?

[Sultan moaning]

Iago: Here's your cracker! Shoved all the way down your throat! Here! Have lots!

Jasmine: Stop it! Jafar, leave him alone!

[Jafar gestures Iago to stop, Iago growls as he shoves the remaining crackers down the Sultan]

Jafar: It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. 
What do you say, my dear? Why, with you as my queen...

Jasmine: [throws wine at Jafar's face] Never!

Jafar: [enraged growl] I'll teach you some respect!!

[Jasmine gasps]

Jafar: Now... Genie. I have decided to make my final wish. I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me.

Genie: Ah, Master, there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo...

Jafar: Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout! You will do what I order to do, slave!

Jasmine: Jafar. I never realized how... incredibly handsome you are. [Genie's jaw drops]

Jafar: Mmm... That's better. Now, pussycat... tell me more about myself.

Jasmine: You're tall, dark, well dressed...

Genie: Al. Al, little buddy!

Aladdin: Shh.

Genie: Al, I can't help you. I work for Señor Psychopath now. What are you gonna do?

Aladdin: Hey, I'm a street rat, remember. I'll improvise.

Jasmine: ...cute lite gaps between your teeth.

Jafar: Go on.

Jasmine: And your beard... is so... twisted. You've stolen my heart.

Iago: [gasping] Jaf...! [Iago mumbling]

Jafar: And the street rat?

Jasmine: What street rat?

[clattering]

[gasping]

[gasping]

Both: Yech!

Jafar: That was... [sees Aladdin in the reflection of the crown] You! How many times do I have to kill you, boy?

Aladdin: Get the lamp.

Jafar: Now! Ah, ah, ah, Princess. Your time is up. [growling]

Aladdin: Jasmine.

Iago: Oh, nice shot, Jaf...

Jafar: Don't toy with me.

Aladdin: Abu!

Jafar: Things are unraveling fast now, boy. [Jafar laughing] Get the point? [laughing]

[straining]

Jafar: I'm just getting warmed up.

Aladdin: Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?

Jafar: A snake, am I? Perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike I can be. (Jafar Transforms from Sorcerer to a Gigantic Cobra, Then he tries to Fight Aladdin)

Snake Jafar: [laughing] You little fool. You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth.

Iago: Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze him like a... Awk!

Snake Jafar: Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.

Aladdin: The genie. The genie. The genie has more power than you'll ever have.

Snake Jafar: What?

Aladdin: He gave you your power. He can take it away.

Genie: Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?

Aladdin: Face it, Jafar. You're still just second best.

Snake Jafar: You're right. His power does exceed my own. But not for long.

Genie: The boy is crazy. He's a little punch-drunk. One too many hits with the snake.

Snake Jafar: Slave, I make my third wish. I wish to be an all-powerful genie!

Genie: All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al.

Genie Jafar: (Jafar Transforms From a Snake into a Gigantic Enourmus Genie) Yes. Yes! The power. [Jafar laughs]

[Jasmine coughs]

Genie Jafar: The absolute power!

Jasmine: What have you done?

Aladdin: Trust me.

Genie Jafar: The universe is mine to command, to control!

Aladdin: Not so fast, Jafar. Aren't you forgetting something?

Genie Jafar: Huh?

Aladdin: You wanted to be a genie... you got it.

Genie Jafar: What?! (Large Gold Cuffs clamped onto Jafar’s Wrists)

Aladdin: And everything that goes with it. (Aladdin picks up the Lamp and sucks Jafar into his Lamp)

Aladdin: Jasmine... I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince.

Jasmine: I know why you did.

Aladdin: Well, I guess... this is good-bye?

Jasmine: Oh, that stupid law. This isn't fair. I love you.

Genie: [sniffles] Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left. Just say the word and you're a prince again.

Aladdin: But, Genie, what about your freedom?

Genie: Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude. This is love. Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years. 
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

Aladdin: Jasmine, I do love you, but I got to stop pretending to be something I'm not.

Jasmine: I understand.

Aladdin: Genie, I wish for your freedom.

Genie: One bonafide prince pedigree coming up. What?

Aladdin: Genie, you're free.

Genie: I'm free. I'm free. Quick. Quick. Wish for something outrageous. Say, "I want the Nile." Try that.

Aladdin: Uh, I wish for the Nile.

Genie: Now way! [laughing gleefully] Oh, does that feel good! Oh! I'm free! I'm free at last! I'm hittin' the road. I'm off to see the world. I'm...

Aladdin: Genie, I'm... I'm gonna miss you.

Genie: Me, too, Al. [sniffles] Now matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me.

Sultan: That's right. You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the problem.

Jasmine: Father?

Sultan: Well, am I Sultan or am I Sultan? From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy.

Jasmine: Him. I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.

Aladdin: Call me Al.

#Oh, I come from a land
From a faraway place#
#Where the caravan camels roam#
#Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense#
#It's barbaric but hey, it's home#
#When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west#
#And the sand in the glass is right#
#Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly#
#To another Arabian night#
#Arabian nights#
#Like Arabian days#
#More often than not
Are hotter than hot#
#In a lot of good ways#
#Arabian nights#
#'Neath Arabian moons#
#A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard#
#Out there on the dunes#
Ah, salaam, and good evening
to you, worthy friend.
Please, please, come closer.
T oo close. A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah,
city of mystery,
of enchantment,
and the finest merchandise this side
of the river Jordan, on sale today.
Look at this. Yes.
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break. Will not...
It broke.
Ohh! Look at this.
I have never seen
one of these intact before.
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.
Listen. Ah, still good.
Wait. Don't go.
I can see that you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.
I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.
Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.
Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,
but what is inside that counts.
This is no ordinary lamp.
It once changed the course
of a young man's life.
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.
The diamond in the rough.
Perhaps you would
like to hear the tale?
It begins on a dark night...
where a dark man waits
with a dark purpose.
You are late.
A thousand apologies, O Patient One.
You have it then?
I had to slit a few throats,
but I got it.
Ah-ah-ahhh.
The treasure.
Ow!
Trust me, my pungent friend.
- You'll get what's coming to you.
- What's coming to you. Awk!
Quickly! Follow the trail.
Faster.
At last, after all
my years of searching...
the Cave of Wonders.
Awk. Cave of Wonders.
By Allah.
Now, remember.
Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure
is yours, but the lamp is mine.
Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp.
Jeez, where'd ya dig
this bozo up?
Shh.
Who disturbs my slumber?
It is l, Gazeem,
a humble thief.
Know this.
Only one may enter here,
one whose worth lies far within.
A diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for#Go on.
No!
Seek thee out
the diamond in the rough.
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
We're never gonna get
a hold of that stupid lamp.
Just forget it.
Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.
Patience, lago. Patience.
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
Oh, there's a big surprise.
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.
What are we gonna do?
We got a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one may enter.
I must find this one, this...
diamond in the rough.
Stop! Thief!
Stop! Thief!
I'll have your hands
for a trophy, street rat.
All this for a loaf of bread?
Whoa!
- There he is!
- You won't get away so easy!
You think that was easy?
You two, over that way,
and you, follow me.
- We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.
Getting into trouble a little early
today, aren't we, Aladdin?
Trouble. No way. You're only
in trouble if you get caught.
- Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.
And this time...
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.
- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get outta here.
#Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line#
#One swing ahead of the sword#
#I steal only what I can't afford#
That's everything.
#One jump ahead of the lawmen#
#That's all and that's no joke#
#These guys don't appreciate I'm broke#
- Riffraff.
- Street rat.
- Scoundrel.
- Take that.
#Just a little snack, guys#
#Rip him open
Take it back, guys#
#I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts#
- #You're my only friend, Abu#
- Who?
#Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom#
#He's become a one-man rise in crime#
#I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em#
#Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat#
#Tell you all about it
When I got the time#
#One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom#
#Next time gonna use a nom de plume#
There he is.
#One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock#
#I think I'll take a stroll
Around the block#
- Stop, thief.
- Vandal.
- Abu!
- Scandal.
#Let's not be too hasty#
#Still I think he's rather tasty#
#Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat#
#Otherwise we'd get along#
Wrong.
Get him!
He's got a sword!
You idiots.
We've all got swords.
- #One jump ahead of the hoofbeats#
- Vandal!
- #One hop ahead of the hump#
- Street rat!
- #One trick ahead of disaster#
- Scoundrel!
#They're quick, but I'm much faster#
#Here goes, better throw my hand in#
#Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump#
Yuck! Oy!
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.
All right.
Yum, yum!
Uh-oh.
Here. Go on. Take it.
Ah, don't. Huh?
On his way to the palace, I suppose.
Another suitor for the princess.
- Out of my way, you filthy brats.
Hey!
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.
Look at that, Abu.
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.
Ooh!
You are a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,
and only your fleas will mourn you.
I'm not worthless.
And I don't have fleas.
Come on, Abu.
Let's go home.
#Riffraff, street rat#
#I don't buy that#
#If only they'd look closer#
#Would they see a poor boy#
#No, siree#
#They'd find out#
#There's so much more#
#To me#
Some day, Abu,
things are gonna change.
We'll be rich, live in a palace,
and never have any problems at all.
I've never been so insulted.
Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?
Good luck marrying her off.
Oh! Jasmine.
Jasmine!
Jasmine!
- Jasmine!
Confound it, Rajah.
So, this is why Prince Achmed
stormed out.
Oh, Father.
Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?
You were just playing
with that overdressed,
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.
The law says
you must be married to a prince...
by your next birthday.
The law is wrong.
You've only got three more days.
Father, I hate being forced into this.
If I do marry,
I want it to be for love.
Jasmine...
it's not only this law.
I'm not going to be around forever,
and, well, l...
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.
Provided for.
Please try to understand.
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.
Except you, Rajah.
I've never even been
outside the palace walls.
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.
Then maybe I don't want
to be a princess anymore.
Oooh! I... I...
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.
Hmm?
I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Oh! Ah, Jafar.
My most trusted advisor.
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.
My life is but to serve you, my lord.
It's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses
to choose a husband.
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!
Oh!
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.
Now, then,
perhaps I can divine a solution
to this thorny problem.
If anyone can help, it's you.
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.
Oh. Uh, my ring?
But it's been in the family for years.
It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be... fine.
The diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Whatever you need will be fine.
You are most gracious, my liege.
Now, run along and play
with your little toys, hmm?
Yes. That will be pretty good.
I can't take it anymore!
If I gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...
Bam! Whack!
Calm yourself, lago.
Then I'd grab him around the head.
Whack!
Soon I will be sultan,
not that addle-pated twit.
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat.
Ha, ha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.
I'll miss you.
Goodbye.
Okay, Abu. Go.
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.
Get your paws off that.
Why, you...
Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!
Goodbye.
Nice going, Abu.
Breakfast is served.
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.
Sugar dates.
Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.
Fresh fish!
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
Oh, no. I don't think so.
Oh!
Excuse me.
I'm really very sorry.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
Hello. Hello?
Oh, you must be hungry.
Here you go.
You'd better be able to pay for that.
Pay?
No one steals from my cart.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.
- Thief!
- Please...
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the Sultan.
Do you know what
the penalty is for stealing?
No! No, please!
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.
I've been looking all over for you.
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.
You, uh, know this girl?
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.
She's a little crazy.
She said she knew the Sultan.
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?
Tragic, isn't it?
But no harm done.
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.
Oh, hello, Doctor.
How are you?
- No, no, no. Not that one.
- Come on, Sultan.
Huh. What?
Come back here, you little thieves!
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness,
couldn't we just wait
for a real storm?
Save your breath, lago. Faster.
Yes, O mighty Evil One.
Part, sands of time.
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.
Yes! Yes!
There he is.
My diamond in the rough.
That's him. That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?
Swell.
Almost there.
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.
Uh, forget it.
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?
Is it that obvious?
Well, you do kind of stand out.
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.
Wow.
Hey.
Come on. This way.
Whoa. Watch your head there.
Be careful.
Is this where you live?
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.
That sounds fabulous.
Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.
Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?
Oh, it's wonderful.
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,
and have servants and valets.
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.
It's better than here.
You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.
You're not free to make
your own choices.
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...
...trapped.
So, where are you from?
What does it matter?
I ran away
and I am not going back.
Really. How come?
Why, you...
My father's forcing me
to get married.
That's... that's awful.
Abu!
What?
Abu says, uh...
that's not fair.
What?
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.
And does Abu
have anything else to say?
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.
Oh, boy.
Hmm.
Tell him that's very sweet.
Here you are.
- They're after me! You?
- My father must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...
Then jump!
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?
Run! Go! Get out of here!
Get this thing off of me!
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.
Let him go.
- Looky here, men. A street mouse.
Unhand him,
by order of the princess.
Princess Jasmine.
- The princess?
- Princess?
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.
I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.
Jafar?
Oh, Princess.
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.
How may I be of service to you?
The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?
I can't breathe, Jafar.
Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.
Oh, dear.
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...
What do you mean?
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.
What sentence?
Death.
- By beheading.
- No.
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.
How could you?
So, how did it go?
I think she took it... rather well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
- I didn't even know his name.
She was the princess.
I can't believe it.
I must have sounded
so stupid to her.
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!
Hello!
Abu. Down here.
Come on, help me out of these.
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry.
I'll never see her again.
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.
She's gotta marry a prince.
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!
I'm a fool.
You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.
Who are you?
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.
But together,
perhaps we can be more.
I'm listening.
There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.
Ooh!
Treasure enough to impress even
your princess, I'd wager.
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.
But the law says only a prince can...
You've heard of the golden rule,
haven't you?
Whoever has the gold
makes the rules.
Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?
I need a young pair of legs and
a strong back to go in after it.
Uh, one problem.
It's out there.
We're in here.
Uh-uh. Things aren't always
what they seem.
So...
do we have a deal?
Oh, I don't know.
Who disturbs my slumber?
Uh, it is l, Aladdin.
Proceed.
Touch nothing but the lamp.
Remember, boy,
first fetch me the lamp,
and then you shall
have your reward.
Come on, Abu.
Would you look at that!
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the Sultan.
Abu!
Don't... touch... anything.
We gotta find that lamp.
Huh?
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?
Abu, what are you, crazy?
A magic carpet.
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.
Thanks.
Wait a minute. Don't go.
Maybe you can help us.
Hey! Whoa!
You see, we're trying
to find this lamp.
I think he knows where it is.
Wait here.
Oh!
This is it?
This is what we came
all the way down here to...
Abu! No!
- lnfidels!
- Uh-oh.
You have touched
the forbidden treasure!
Now you will never again
see the light of day!
Whoa!
Help! Help! Help!
Gotcha!
Carpet, let's move.
Abu!
Abu, this is no time to panic.
Start panicking.
Whoa!
- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.
I can't hold on.
Give me your hand.
First give me the lamp.
Yes!
At last!
What are you doing?
Giving you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
It's mine.
It's all mine.
I... where is it?
No.
No!
Jasmine?
Oh, dearest.
What's wrong?
Jafar has...
done something terrible.
There, there, my dear.
We'll set it right.
Now, tell me everything.
Oh.
Aladdin. Wake up.
Aladdin.
Oh! My head.
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal!
Whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.
Aha!
Why, you hairy little thief.
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.
Hey, I think there's
something written here,
but it's hard to make out.
Aaaaahhhhh!
Oy!
, years will give you
such a crick in the neck.
Hang on a second.
Whoa! Whoa!
Does it feel good
to be outta there.
Nice to be back,
ladies and gentlemen.
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you "Al"?
Or maybe just "Din."
How about "Laddie"?
Sounds like, "Here, boy. C'mon, Laddie."
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
Oh, sorry, Cheetah.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.
Give me some tass-el.
Yeah. Yo, yo.
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.
That or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look from the side. Do I look different?
Wait a minute.
I'm your master?
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?
The ever impressive,
the long contained,
often imitated,
but never duplicated...
Duplicated, duplicated...
Genie...
of the Lamp!
Right here direct from the lamp,
right here for your
very much wish fulfillment.
Thank you.
Whoa. Wish fulfillment?
Three wishes to be exact.
And ix-nay on the wishing
for more wishes.
That's it. Three.
Uno, dos, tres.
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.
Now I know I'm dreaming.
Master, I don't think you quite realize
what you've got here.
So why don't you just ruminate
whilst I illuminate
the possibilities.
#Well, Ali Baba had them  thieves#
#Scheherazade had a thousand tales#
#But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves#
#You got a brand of magic never fails#
#You got some power in your corner now#
#Some heavy ammunition in your camp#
#You got some punch pizzazz
Yahoo and how#
#See, all you gotta do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say#
#Mr. Aladdin, sir,
What will your pleasure be#
#Let me take your order
Jot it down#
#You ain't never had a friend like me#

#Me#
Ah ha ha!
Wah ha ha!
#You ain't never had a friend like me#
Huh?
So, what'll it be, Master?
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?
Ah, almost.
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.
Like?
Ah, rule number one:
I can't kill anybody.
So don't ask.
Rule number two.
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.
You little punim there.
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.
Other than that, you got it.
- Hmm.
- Oh!
Provisos?
You mean limitations?
On wishes?
Some all-powerful genie.
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out.
Excuse me?
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?
And you're walking out on me?
I don't think so,
not right now.
You're gettin' your wishes,
so sit down!
- In case of emergency,
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.
We're...
outta here!
Jafar, this is an outrage.
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,
before they are beheaded.
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.
Jasmine...
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.
Please.
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.
When I am queen, I will have
the power to get rid of you.
That's nice.
All settled, then.
Now, Jasmine, getting back to
this suitor business... Jasmine?
Jasmine!
If only I had gotten that lamp.
"l will have the power
to get rid of you."
To think
we gotta keep kissing up
to that chump
and his chump daughter
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, lago.
Only until she finds
a chump husband.
Then she'll have us banished.
Or beheaded.
Eww!
Oh. Wait a minute.
Jafar. What if you were
the chump husband?
What?
Okay, you marry
the princess, all right?
And, uh, then you
become the sultan.
Oh.
Marry the shrew.
I become the sultan.
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.
Yaaah!
Kersplat!
I love the way
your foul little mind works.
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.
Thank you.
Goodbye now. Good-ye.
Thank you.
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.
Dost mine ears deceive me?
Three. You are down by one, boy.
Ah, no. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.
You did that on your own.
Well, I feel sheepish.
All right, you baaad boy,
but no more freebies.
Fair deal.
So, three wishes.
I want them to be good.
What would you wish for?
Me?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well, in my case...
Ah, forget it.
- What?
- No, I can't. I...
Come on. Tell me.
Freedom.
You're a prisoner?
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
Itty bitty living space.
Genie, that's terrible.
But, oh, to be free.
Not have to go,
"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"
To be my own master.
Such a thing would be
greater than all the magic
and all the treasures
in all the world.
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.
Why not?
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.
So you can guess how often
that's happened.
I'll do it. I'll set you free.
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.
after I make my first two wishes,
I'll use my third wish
to set you free.
Well, here's hopin'.
All right.
Let's make some magic.
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?
Well, there's this girl.
Wrong.
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?
Oh, but, Genie,
she's smart and fun and...
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.
She's got these eyes that just...
and this hair. Wow.
And her smile...
Ami.
C'est l'amour.
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...
Hey, can you make me a prince?
Let's see here.
Chicken à la king? Nope.
Alaskan king crab.
Ow. I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad. Ah!
Et tu, Brute. No.
Aha. "To make a prince."
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.
All right!
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?
No. Let's work with me here.
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?
It says mode of transportation.
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aqui. Over here.
- Uh-oh.
- Here he comes.
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah
than riding your very own
brand-new camel.
Watch out. They spit.
Mmm. Not enough.
Still not enough.
Let's see.
What do you need?
Yes!
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.
Whoa!
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.
Abu, you look good.
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.
But we're not through yet.
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.
Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.
Awk. The problem with your daughter.
Oh, really?
Right here.
"lf the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,
then the sultan shall
choose for her."
But Jasmine hated
all those suitors.
How could I choose
someone she hates?
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.
"lf in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found,"
Jerk.
"a princess must then be wed to..."
Hmm. Interesting.
What? Who?
The royal vizier.
Why, that would be... me.
But I thought the law says
that only a prince
can marry a princess.
I'm quite sure that...
Desperate times call for
desperate measures, my lord.
Yes. Desperate measures.
You will order
the princess to marry me.
I will order...
the princess...
to...
But you're so old.
The princess will marry me.
The princess will marry...
- What. What is that?
That music.
Jafar, you must come
and see this.
#Make way for Prince Ali#
#Say hey#
#It's Prince Ali#
#Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar#
#Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star#
#Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye#
#Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums#
#You're gonna love this guy#
#Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa#
#Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee#
#Now, try your best to stay calm#
#Brush up your Sunday salaam#
#Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie#
#Prince Ali, mighty is he,
Ali Ababwa#
#Strong as ten regular men definitely#
#He faced the galloping hordes#
#A hundred bad guys with swords#
#Who sent those goons to their lords
Why, Prince Ali#
#He's got  golden camels#
Don't they look lovely, June?
#Purple peacocks, he's got #
Fabulous, Harry.
I love the feathers.
#When it comes to exotic-type mammals#
#Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you#
#It's a world-class menagerie#
#Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa#
#That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee#
#Well, get on out in that square#
#Adjust your veil and prepare#
#To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali#
- #He's got  white Persian monkeys#
- #He's got the monkeys#
- #Let's see the monkeys#
- #And to view them he charges no fee#
#He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies#
#Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him#
#They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali#
#Prince Ali#
#Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa#
#Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see#
#And that, good people, is why#
#He got dolled up and dropped by#
#With  elephants, llamas galore#
#With bears and lions,
A brass band and more#
#With his  fakirs,
His cooks, his bakers#
#His birds that warble on key#
#Make way#
#For Prince Ali#
Splendid.
Absolutely marvelous.
Your Majesty,
I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Of course.
I'm delighted to meet you.
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.
Ecstatic.
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
- Ababwa.
Whatever.
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to...
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.
Ooh.
I don't suppose I might...
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.
Sire, I must advise against this.
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.
Ow, ow, ow.
Ahh! Whoa!
Just where did you say
you were from?
Oh, much farther than
you've traveled, I'm sure.
- Try me.
- Look out, Polly.
Hey, watch it.
Watch it with the dumb rug.
Aah!
Whew!
Out of the way.
I'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.
Yes, I do seem
to have a knack for it.
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.
If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure. Not!
Jasmine will like this one.
And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.
This boy is no different
from the others.
What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?
Your Majesty,
I am Prince Ali Ababwa.
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.
How dare you.
All of you. Standing around
deciding my future?
I am not a prize to be won.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time
to cool down.
I think it's time to say good-bye
to Prince Abooboo.
What am I gonna do?
Jasmine won't even
let me talk to her.
I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.
So move.
Hey.
That's a good move.
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.
Genie, I need help.
All right, Sparky,
here's the deal.
If you wanna court
the little lady,
you gotta be
a straight shooter.
- Do you got it?
- What?
Tell her the...
-...truth!
- No way.
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,
she'd laugh at me.
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.
I just... I gotta be smooth,
cool, confident.
How do I look?
Like a prince.
Princess Jasmine?
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.
I do not want to see you.
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.
- Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.
So, how's our little beau doing?
Good kitty, take off.
Down, kitty.
Wait. Wait.
Do I know you?
Uh, no. No.
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.
The marketplace?
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants.
It couldn't have been me you met.
No. I guess not.
Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.
She's smart, fun,
the hair, the eyes.
Anything. Pick a feature.
Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...
- Wonderful, magnificent, punctual.
-...punctual.
- Punctual?
- Sorry.
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.
Hmm.
I'm rich, too, you know.
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.
I know.
A fine prize
for any prince to marry.
Uh, right. Right.
A prince like me.
Warning! Warning!
Right. A prince like you.
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.
Mayday! Mayday!
Just go jump off
a balcony!
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.
- Yeah, right.
- What?
Uh... Uh, you're right.
You aren't just
some prize to be won.
You should be free
to make your own choice.
I'll go now.
- No!
- What? What?
How...
How are you doing that?
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.
You, uh...
You don't want to go
for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
Yes.
Yes.
#I can show you the world#
#Shining, shimmering, splendid#
#Tell me, Princess#
#Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide#
#I can open your eyes#
#Take you wonder by wonder#
#Over, sideways and under#
#On a magic carpet ride#
#A whole new world#
#A new fantastic point of view#
#No one to tell us no
Or where to go#
#Or say we're only dreaming#
#A whole new world#
#A dazzling place
I never knew#
#But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear#
#That now I'm in
A whole new world with you#
#Now I'm in
A whole new world with you#
#Unbelievable sights#
#Indescribable feeling#
#Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling#
#Through an endless diamond sky#
- #A whole new world#
- #Don't you dare close your eyes#
- #A hundred thousand things to see#
- #Hold your breath, it gets better#
#I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far#
#I can't go back to where I used to be#
- #A whole new world#
- #Every turn a surprise#
- #With new horizons to pursue#
- #Every moment, red-letter#
#I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare#
#Let me share
This whole new world with you#
- #A whole new world#
- #A whole new world#
- #That's where we'll be#
- #That's where we'll be#
- #A thrilling chase#
- #A wondrous place#
#For you and me#
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.
It's a shame
Abu had to miss this.
Nah. He hates fireworks.
He doesn't like flying, either.
Uh, that is, um...
Oh, no.
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.
- Why did you lie?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.
Who are you?
Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The truth. Um...
The truth is...
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um...
to escape the pressures
of palace life.
But I really am a prince.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Well, you know...
royalty going out
into the city in disguise,
it sounds a little strange,
don't you think?
Hmm.
Not that strange.
Good night, my handsome prince.
Sleep well, Princess.
Yes!
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.
Abu. Abu.
Hold him.
I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abooboo.
Why, you...
Make sure he's never found.
Never fails. Get in the bath
and there's a rub at the lamp.
Hello? Al?
Al! Kid, snap out of it.
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.
You have to say, "Genie,
I want you to save my life." Got it?
Come on, Aladdin!
I'll take that as a yes.
Up scope.
Don't you scare me like that.
Genie, l, uh...
I...
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.
Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.
Jasmine.
Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.
- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.
I have chosen a husband for you.
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.
I will never marry you.
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.
Better check your
crystal ball again, Jafar.
Prince Ali!
How in the... uh. Awk!
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.
He is obviously lying.
Obviously lying.
Father, what's wrong with you?
I know what's wrong.
Oh, my!
Jafar's been controlling you with this.
What? Jafar?
You, you traitor!
Your Majesty,
all this can be explained.
Guards! Guards!
Well, that's it.
We're dead. Forget it.
Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.
Arrest Jafar at once.
This is not done yet, boy.
Find him!
- Search everywhere!
- Jasmine, are you all right?
Yes.
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,
plotting against me all this time.
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will I ever...
Huh?
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.
I won't.
I'll leave that to my...
But you two will be wed at once.
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy
and prosperous,
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.
- Sultan?
- Yes.
A fine upstanding youth
such as yourself,
a person of your
unimpeachable moral character
is exactly what this kingdom needs.
We gotta get outta here.
I gotta start packing.
Only essentials.
We gotta travel light.
Bring the guns, the weapons,
and how about this picture?
I think I'm making a weird face in it.
Oh, boy. He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.
Jafar! Jafar!
Get a grip!
Good grip.
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.
- He has the lamp, lago.
- Why, that miserable...
But you are going
to relieve him of it.
Me?
Sultan?
They want me to be Sultan?
Huzzah!
#Hail the conquering hero#
Aladdin, you've just won
the heart of the princess.
What are you gonna do next?
Psst. Your line is,
"I'm going to free the genie."
Anytime.
- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.
You just go,
"Genie, I wish you free."
I'm serious.
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.
No. They wanna make
Prince Ali sultan.
Without you,
I'm just Aladdin.
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.
The only reason anyone thinks
I'm worth anything is because of you.
What if they find out
I'm not really a prince?
What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.
Genie, I can't
keep this up on my own.
I can't wish you free.
Fine. I understand.
You've lied to everyone else.
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Master.
Genie, I'm really sorry.
Well, fine.
Then just stay in there.
What are you guys looking at?
Look, l... I'm sorry.
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...
Wait. Come on.
What am I doing?
Genie's right.
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.
Ali. Oh, Ali.
Will you come here?
Well, here goes.
Jasmine?
Where are you?
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.
I'm coming.
You got a problem, Pinky?
Jerk.
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.
- Excellent work, lago.
- Ah, go on.
No, really. On a scale of
one to ten, you are an eleven.
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.
I'm embarrassed.
I'm blushing.
People of Agrabah,
my daughter has finally
chosen a suitor.
Jasmine.
Ali, where have you been?
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.
The whole kingdom's turned out
for Father's announcement.
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.
- You don't understand...
- Good luck.
...Ali Ababwa!
Oh, boy.
Look at them,
cheering that little pipsqueak.
Let them cheer.
Let them cheer.
You know, Al, I'm getting really...
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al
will be played by a tall, dark
and sinister ugly man.
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
I wish to rule on high as sultan.
- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.
What is this?
What's going on?
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?
Father.
Jafar, you vile betrayer.
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
Oh, yeah?
We'll just see about that.
The lamp.
Finders keepers, Abooboo.
Genie, no!
Sorry, kid.
I got a new master now.
Jafar, I order you to stop.
Ah, but there's a new order now.
My order.
Finally, you will bow to me.
We will never bow to you.
Why am I not surprised?
If you won't bow before a sultan,
then you will cower
before a sorcerer!
Genie, my second wish...
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer
in the world!
Genie, stop!
Ladies and gentlemen,
a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.
Down, boy.
Oh, Princess.
There's someone I'm dying
to introduce you to.
Jafar. Get your hands off her.
#Prince Ali
Yes, it is he#
#But not as you know him#
#Read my lips
And come to grips with reality#
#Yes, meet a blast from your past#
#Whose lies were too good to last#
#Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali#
Or should we say Aladdin?
Ali?
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I'm just...
#So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin#
#Just a con, need I go on#
#Take it from me#
#His personality flaws#
#Give me adequate cause#
#To send him packing
On a one-way trip#
#So his prospects
Take a terminal dip#
#His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!#
- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.
#Ex-Prince Ali#
Abu.
Abu!
Oh, this is all my fault.
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance. Abu.
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry, Abu.
I made a mess of everything.
Somehow... I gotta go back
and set things right.
Carpet.
Abu, start digging.
That's it.
Yeah! All right!
Now, back to Agrabah.
Let's go.
Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here's your cracker.
Shoved all the way down your throat.
Here. Have lots.
Stop it.
Jafar, leave him alone.
It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.
A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself
should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world.
What do you say, my dear?
Why, with you as my queen...
Never.
I'll teach you some respect.
No. Genie.
I have decided
to make my final wish.
I wish for Princess Jasmine
to fall desperately
in love with me.
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quo...
Don't talk back to me,
you big blue lout.
You will do what
I order you to do, slave.
Jafar.
I never realized how...
incredibly handsome you are.
Mmm. That's better.
Now, pussycat...
tell me more about myself.
You're tall...
dark...
well dressed...
Al. Al, little buddy.
Shh.
Al, I can't help you.
I work for Señor Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise.
...cute little gaps
between your teeth.
Go on.
And your beard...
is so... twisted.
- You've stolen my heart.
- Jaf...!
- And the street rat?
What street rat?
Yech!
That was...
You!
How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?
Get the lamp.
No!
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.
Jasmine.
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...
Don't toy with me.
Abu!
Things are unraveling
fast now, boy.
Get the point?
I'm just getting warmed up.
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?
A snake, am l?
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.
#Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake#
You stay out of this.
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... great!
Aladdin.
Jasmine, hang on.
You little fool.
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!
Without the genie, boy,
you're nothing.
The genie. The genie.
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.
What?
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.
But not for long.
The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.
One too many hits with the snake.
Slave, I make my third wish.
I wish to be
an all-powerful genie!
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.
Yes.
Yes!
The power.
The absolute power!
- What have you done?
- Trust me.
The universe is mine to command,
to control!
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie...
you got it.
What?
And everything that goes with it.
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
You're the genie. I don't want...
Itty bitty living space.
Al, you little genius, you.
Ahh!
Get your blasted beak
out of my face.
- Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
Allow me.
, years in a Cave of Wonders
ought to chill him out.
Shut up!
Jasmine...
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.
I know why you did.
Well, I guess...
this is good-bye?
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.
I love you.
Al, no problem.
You've still got one wish left.
Just say the word
and you're a prince again.
But, Genie,
what about your freedom?
Hey, it's only
an eternity of servitude.
This is love.
Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.
Believe me, I know.
I've looked.
Jasmine, I do love you,
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.
I understand.
Genie, I wish for your freedom.
One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.
- What?
- Genie, you're free.
I'm free. I'm free.
Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.
Say, "l want the Nile." Try that.
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!
I'm free! I'm free at last!
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world.
I'm...
Genie, I'm...
I'm gonna miss you.
Me, too, Al.
No matter
what anybody says,
you'll always be a prince to me.
That's right.
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.
It's that law
that's the problem.
- Father?
- Well, am I Sultan or am I Sultan?
From this day forth,
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.
Him. I choose...
I choose you, Aladdin.
Call me Al.
Oh, all of ya, come over here.
Big group hug.
Group hug.
Mind if I kiss the monkey?
Ooh, hairball.
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.
I'm outta here!
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hey, Rugman, ciao.
I'm history.
No, I'm mythology.
I don't care what I am. I'm free!
#A whole new world#
#A whole new life#
#For you and me#
#A whole new world #?
Made you look.

ALADDIN 

Oh, I come from a land
From a faraway place

Where the caravan camels roam

Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense

It's barbaric, but hey, it's home

When the Wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west

And the sand in the glass is right

Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly

To another Arabian night

Arabian nights

Like Arabian days

More often than not
Are hotter than hot



In a lot of good ways

Arabian nights

'Neath Arabian moons

A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard

Out there on the dunes

Ah, sa/aam and good evening
to you, worthy friend.

Please, please, come closer.

Too close. A little too close.

There.

Welcome to Agrabah,

city of mystery, of enchantment,

and the finest merchandise
this side of the River Jordan,

on sale today. Come on down.

Look at this. Yes.



Will not break. Will not...

It broke.

Ohh! Look at this.

I have never seen
one of these intact before.

This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.

Listen. Ah, still good.

Wait. Don't go.

I can see that you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.

Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,

but what is inside that counts.

This is no ordinary lamp.

It once changed the course
of a young man's life.

A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

A diamond in the rough.

It begins on a dark night,

where a dark man waits

with a dark purpose.

(HORSE NICKERS)

You are late.

A thousand apologies, O patient one.

You have it, then?

I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.

Ah-ah-ahhh.

The treasure.

OW!

Trust me, my pungent friend.

- You'll get what's coming to you.
- What's coming to you. Awk!

Quickly! Follow the trail.

Faster.

(HORSE NEIGHS)

(WIND HOWLING)

JAFAR: At last,
after all my years of searching,

the Cave of Wonders.

Awk. Cave of Wonders.

By Allah.

Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.

The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

(CHUCKLES)

Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp.

Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?

Shh.

(ECHOING RUMBLE)

- Who disturbs my slumber?
-(THIEF GASPS)

It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

Know this.

Only one may enter here,

one whose worth lies far within.

A diamond in the rough.

What are you waiting for? Go on.

(BEAST SIGHING)

-(ROARING)
-(SCREAMING)

No!

(couemwe)

I can't believe it. I just don't believe it.

We're never gonna get
a hold of that stupid lamp.

Just forget it. Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.

Patience, Iago. Patience.

Gazeem was obviously
less than worthy.

Oh, there's a big surprise.

I think I'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.

What are we gonna do?
We got a big problem here, a big...

Yes.

Only one may enter.

I must find this one, this...

Diamond in the rough.

MAN: Stop! Thief!

I'll have your hands for a trophy,
street rat.

All this for a loaf of bread?

Whoa!

(SCREAMING)

- GUARD: There he is!
- You won't get away so easy!

You think that was easy?

(GIGGLING)

You two, over that way,
and you, follow me.

- We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.

Getting into trouble a little early
today, aren't we, Aladdin?

- Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.

And this time...

(MONKEY SQUENQNG

Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get outta here.

(SINGING) Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line

One swing ahead of the sword

I steal only what I can't afford

That's everything

One jump ahead of the lawmen

That's all, and that's no joke

- Riffraff
- BOTH: Street rat

GUARD: Scoundrel
MAN". Take that

Just a little snack, guys

Rip him open
Take it back, guys

I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts

- You're my only friend, Abu
- WOMEN: Who?

Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom

He's become a one-man rise in crime

I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em

Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat

Tell you all about it
When I got the time

One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom

Next time gonna use a nom de plume

There he is

One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock

I think I'll take a stroll
Around the block

- MAN: Stop, thief
- Vanda/

- Abu
Scandal

Let's not be too hasty

Still I think he's rather tasty

Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat

Otherwise we'd get along

GUARDS: Wrong

MAIN GUARD: Get him!

He's got a sword!

You idiots. We've all got swords.

(GROANING)

- One jump ahead of the hoof beats
- Vandal!

- One hop ahead of the hump
- Street rat!

- One trick ahead of disaster
Scoundrel!

They're quick, but I'm much faster

Here goes, better throw my hand in

Wish me happy landin'
AH I gotta do is jump

(SCREAMING)

GUARDS: Yuck! Oy!

ABU: Yum, yum!

Uh-oh.

(SIGHS)

Here. Go on. Take it.

(GIGGLING)

(GROANS)

Ah, don't. Huh?

On his way to the palace, I suppose.

Another suitor for the princess.

-(GIGGLING)
-(WOMAN SCREAMS)

-(WHINNYING)
- Out of my way, you filthy brats.

Hey!

If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

Oh. I'll teach you some manners.

(MEN LAUGH)

(GRIMACING)

Look at that, Abu.

It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

CROWD: Ooh!

You are a worthless street rat.

You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,

and only your fleas will mourn you.

I'm not worthless.

And I don't have fleas.

(SINGING) Riffraff, street rat

I don't buy that

If only they'd look closer

Would they see a poor boy?

No, siree

They'd find out

There's so much more

To me

(SIGHS) Someday, Abu,
things are gonna change.

We'll be rich, live in a palace,

and never have any problems at all.

(ROOSTERS GROWING)

I've never been so insulted.

Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

Good luck marrying her off.

Oh! Jasmine.

Jasmine!

Jasmine!

- Jasmine!
-(SNARLING)

Confound it, Rajah.

So, this is why
Prince Achmed stormed out.

Oh, Father.

Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?

You were just playing
with that overdressed,

self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(CLEARS THROAT)

Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

The law says
you must be married to a prince

by your next birthday.

The law is wrong.

You've only got three more days.

Father, I hate being forced into this.

If I do marry, I want it to be for love.

Jasmine,

it's not only this law.

I'm not going to be around forever,
and, well, I...

I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

Provided for.

Please try to understand.

I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

(GRUMBLES)

Except you, Rajah.

I've never even been outside
the palace walls.

But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

Then maybe I don't want
to be a princess anymore.

Oooh! l... l...

Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

Hmm?

I don't know where she gets it from.

Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

Oh! Ah, Jafar.

My most trusted advisor.

My life is but to serve you, my lord.

- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!

(LAUGHING) on!

- Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
-(JAFAR LAUGHS)

Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

(GRUMBLES)

Now, then,
perhaps I can divine a solution

to this thorny problem.

If anyone can help, it's you.

But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

Oh- Uh, my ring?

But it's been in the family for years.

It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.

Don't worry.

Everything will be fine.

Everything will be fine.

The diamond.

Here, Jafar.

Whatever you need will be fine.

You are most gracious, my liege.

Now, run along and play
with your little toys, hmm?

Yes. That will be pretty good.

(SPITS, COUGHS)

I can't take it anymore!

If I gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

Barn! Whack!

Calm yourself, Iago.

Then I'd grab him around the head.
VVhack!

Soon I will be sultan,
not that addlepated twit.

And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat. Ha, ha!

(WHINING)

Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

I'll miss you.

(WHIMPERS)

Good bye.

(VENDORS CALLING OUT)

Okay, Abu. Go.

Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

(SQUEAKING)

- Get your paws off that.
-(TAUNTING)

Why, you...

Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!

Good bye.

- Nice going, Abu.
-(COOING)

Breakfast is served.

Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.

Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.

Sugar dates and pistachios.

Would the lady like a necklace?

A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

Fresh fish!

We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

Oh, no. I don't think so.

- Om
-(GULPING)

- Excuse me.
-(GULPS)

(BELCHES)

I'm really very sorry.

Wow.

Uh-oh.

Hello? Hello?

Oh, you must be hungry.

Here you go.

You'd better be able to pay for that.

- Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.

Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.

- Thief!
- Please...

If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the sultan.

Do you know
what the penalty is for stealing?

No! No, please!

Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

I've been looking all over for you.

- What are you doing?
- Just play along.

You, uh, know this girl?

Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

She's a little crazy.

She said she knew the sultan.

She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

(GIBBERISH)

Tragic, isn't it?

But no harm done.

Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?

No, no, no. Not that one.
Come on, Sultan.

(GIBBERING)

(GASPING)

Huh? What?

Come back here, you little thieves!

(EXPLOSION)

couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

Save your breath, Iago. Faster.

Yes, O mighty evil one.

(PANTING)

Part, sands of time.

Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

Yes! Yes!

There he is.

My diamond in the rough.

That's him? That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

Swell.

(COUGHS)

(SINISTER LAUGHTER)

Almost there.

I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

Uh, forget it.

So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

Is it that obvious?

Well, you do kind of stand out.

I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

Wow.

(CHUCKLING) Hey.

Come on. This way.

Whoa. Watch your head there.

Be careful.

Is this where you live?

Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

That sounds fabulous.

Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.

Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?

Oh, it's wonderful.

I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

and have servants and valets.

Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

It's better than here.

You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.

You're not free
to make your own choices.

- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

- Trapped.
- Trapped.

(CLEARS THROAT)
So, where are you from?

What does it matter?

I ran away and I am not going back.

- Really? How come?
- Why, you...

My father's forcing me to get married.

That's... That's awful.

- ALADDINI Abu!
-(ANGRY SQUEAKING)

What?

Abu says, uh, that's not fair.

What?

- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.

And does Abu
have anything else to say?

Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

Oh, boy.

Hmm.

Tell him that's very sweet.

Here you are.

- They're after me!
- They're after you?

My father must have sent them...

- Do you trust me?
- What?

- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

Then jump!

We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

Run! Go! Get out of here!

Get this thing off of me!

- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.

Let him go.

- Looky here, men. A street mouse.
-(GUARDS LAUGH)

Unhand him, by order of the princess.

Princess Jasmine.

- The princess?
- ABU: Princess?

That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

J afar?

Oh, Princess.

Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

How may I be of service to you?

The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

I can't breathe, Jafar.

Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

If you could just... Aah! That hurt!

He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

Oh, dear.

Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...

What do you mean?

Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

What sentence?

- Death.
-(GASPING)

- By beheading.
- No.

I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

How could you?

(WEEPING)

(couemwe)

(GASPING)

So, how did it go?

I think she took it rather well.

(JASMINE CRYING)

It's all my fault, Rajah.

- I didn't even know his name.
-(RAJAH MURMURING)

I must have sounded so stupid to her.

ABUI Y00-h00! Aladdin! Hello!

Abu. Down here.

(SQUEAKING)

Come on, help me out of these.

(SCOLDING)

Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Don't worry, Abu.
I'll never see her again.

I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

She's gotta marry a prince.

- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

I'm a fool.

MAN: You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.

Who are you?

A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

I'm listening.

There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,

filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

Ooh!

Treasure enough to impress
even your princess, I'd wager.

Jaiar, can you hurry up'?
I'm Gym' 'm here.

-(SQUAWKING)
- But the law says only a prince can...

You've heard of the golden rule,
haven't you?

(WHEEZING LAUGH)

Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?

I need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to go in after it.

Uh, one problem.

It's out there. We're in here.

Uh-uh. Things aren't always
what they seem.

So, do we have a deal?

Oh, I don't know.

(THUNDER CRASHING)

Who disturbs my slumber?

Uh, it is I, Aladdin.

Proceed.

Touch nothing but the lamp.

And then you shall have your reward.

Come on, Abu.

(SQUEAKING)

- Would you look at that!
-(WHIMPERING)

Abu!

(WHINES)

Don't touch anything.

We gotta find that lamp.

(GRUMBLES)

Huh?

- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?

(SCREECHES)

Abu, what are you, crazy?

A magic carpet.

Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

(SCREECHES)

Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.

Thanks.

(SQUEAKING)

Wait a minute. Don't go.

Maybe you can help us.

Hey! Whoa!

- I think he knows where it is.
-(SQUEAKS EXCITEDLY)

(ECHOE5)

(WHISPERS) Wait here.

(MOANING)

Oh!

This is it?

This is what we came
all the way down here to...

Abu! No!

- CAVE: lnfidels!
- Uh-oh.

CAVE: You have touched
the forbidden treasure!

Now you will never again
see the light of day!

Whoa!

Help! Help! Help!

Gotcha!

Carpet, let's move.

Abu!

Abu, this is no time to panic.

Start panicking.

BOTH: Whoa!

(ABU PANTING)

(THUNDER CRACKS)

(ROARING)

- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.

I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

First give me the lamp.

(MANIACAL LAUGHTER)

Yes!

At last!

-(WICKED LAUGHTER)
-(ALADDIN STRUGGLES)

What are you doing?

Giving you your reward.

Your eternal reward.

(SCREAMING)

(YELLING)

(ROARING)

(CHUCKUNG)

It's mine.

It's all mine.

I... Where is it?

No.

No!

Jasmine?

SULTAN: Oh, dearest.

What's wrong?

(SNIFFLING)

Jafar has

done something terrible.

There, there, my dear.

We'll set it right.

Now, tell me everything.

Oh.

Aladdin. Wake up.

Aladdin.

On! My head.

We're trapped.

That two-faced son of a jackal!

(SNARLING)

Whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

Aha!

(CHUCKLING)
Why, you hairy little thief.

Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece ofjunk.

Hey, I think there's
something written here,

but it's hard to make out.

Aaaaahhhhh!

C)y!

10,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

Hang on a second.

V\/hoa! Whoa!

Does it feel good to be outta there.

Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?

How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."

I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
(GIGGLING)

Oh, sorry, Cheeta.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.

Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.

Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.

Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.

Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?

Wait a minute. I'm your master?

That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

The ever impressive,

the long contained,

the often imitated,

but never duplicated...

(ECHOING) Duplicated, duplicated...

Genie of the Lamp!

Right here direct from the lamp,

right here
for your very much wish fulfilment.

Thank you.

- Whoa. Wish fulfilment?
- Three wishes, to be exact.

And ixnay on the wishing
for more wishes.

That's it. Three. Lino, dos, tres.

Now I know I'm dreaming.

Master, I don't think you quite realize
what you've got here.

So why don't you just ruminate
whilst I illuminate the possibilities.

(SINGING)
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves

Scheherazade had a thousand tales

But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves

You got a brand of magic never fails

You got some power
In your corner now

You got some punch, pizzazz
Yahoo and how

See, all you gotta do
ls rub that lamp and I'll say

"Mr. Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?"

Let me take your order
Jot it down

You ain't never had a friend like me

Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'

Come on, whisper what it is you want

You ain't never had a friend like me

Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service

You're the boss, the king, the shah

Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish

How 'bout a little more baklava?

Have some of column A
Try all of column B

I'm in the mood to help you, dude

You ain't never had a friend like me

Oh, my

No, no

My, my

(SCATTING)

Can your friends do this?

Can your friends do that?

Can your friends pull this

Out their little hat?

Can your friends go poof

Hey, looky here
Ha-ha!

Can your friends go
"Abracadabra, let her rip"

So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed

I'm hereto answer
AH your midnight prayers

You got me bona fide certified

You got a genie
For your charge daffaires

I got a powerful urge to help you out

So what's your wish?
I really wanna know

You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt

AH you gotta do is rub like so

Mr. Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three

I'm on the job, you big nabob

You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend

You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend

You ain't never had a friend

Like me

Ah-ha-ha!

- Wah-ha-ha!
-(GREEDY LAUGH)

You ain't never had a friend like me

-(BUZZING)
-(WEAK APPLAUSE)

(CHATTERING) Huh?

-(GROANS)
- So, what'll it be, master?

You're gonna grant rne
any three wishes I want, right?

Ah, almost.

There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

Like?

So don't ask.

Rule number two.

I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

You little ponem there.

Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

Other than that, you got it.

- Hmm.
- Oh!

Provisos? You mean limitations?

On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.

Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out of here.

Excuse me?

Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

And all of sudden
you're walking out on me?

I don't think so, not right now.

-(ABU SCREECHES)
- In case of emergency,

the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

We're...

Outta here!

SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage.

If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with rne,

before they are beheaded.

I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

Jasmine...

Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

Please.

At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

When I am queen,
I will have the power to get rid of you.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.

Now, Jasmine, getting back
to this suitor business... Jasmine?

Jasmine!

(GROWLS)

if only I had gotten that lamp.

(GROWLING)
To think we gotta keep kissing up

-for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.

Then she'll have us banished.

Or beheaded.

BOTH: Eww!

Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.

What?

And, uh, then you become the sultan.

Oh.

Marry the shrew.

I become the sultan.

- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

Yaaah!

Kersplat!

(WICKED LAUGHTER)

I love the way
your foul little mind works.

(BOTH LAUGH SINISTERLY)

Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

Thank you. Goodbye now.
Good-bye. Thank you.

Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

Dost mine ears deceive me?

Three? You are down by one, boy.

Ah, no. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

You did that on your own.

Well, I feel sheepish.

All right, you bad boy,
but no more freebies.

Fair deal. So, three wishes.

I want them to be good.

What would you wish for?

Me?

No one's ever asked me that before.

Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

- What?
- No, I can't. I...

Come on. Tell me.

Freedom.

You're a prisoner?

It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

Phenomenal cosmic powers...

ltty bitty living space.

Genie, that's terrible.

But, oh, to be free...

Not have to go,
"Poof. What do you need?

"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

To be my own master.

Such a thing would be greater
than all the magic

and all the treasures in all the world.

But what am I talking about?

Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.

Why not?

The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

So you can guess how often
that's happened.

I'll do it. I'll set you free.

- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

After I make my first two wishes,

I'll use my third wish to set you free.

Well, here's hopin'. All right.

Let's make some magic.

So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

Well, there's this girl.

Wrong.

I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

Oh, but, Genie,
she's smart and fun and...

- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

She's got these eyes that just...
And this hair. Wow.

And her smile... (SIGHS)

Ami.

C'est I'amour.

But she's the princess.

Hey, can you make me a prince?

Let's see here.

Chicken é la king? Nope.

Alaskan king crab.
Ow. I hate it when they do that.

Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No.

Aha. "To make a prince."

Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

All right!

Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

No. Let's work with me here.

Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.

Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

It says mode of transportation.

Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aqul'. Over here.

- Uh-oh.
- GENIE: Here he comes.

What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

than riding
your very own, brand-new camel?

Watch out. They spit.

Mmm. Not enough.

Still not enough.
Let's see. What do you need?

Yes!

Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

- Whoa!
-(TRUMPETS)

Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

(TRUMPETS)

(FRIGHTENED MONKEY NOISES)

Abu, you look good.

GENIE: He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.

But we're not through yet.

Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.

(DOOR OPENS)

Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

Oh, really?

Right here.

"If the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

"then the sultan shall choose for her."

But Jasmine hated all those suitors.

How could I choose someone
she hates?

Not to worry, my liege. There is more.

"If in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found..."

Jerk.

"A princess must then be wed to..."

Hmm. Interesting.

What? Who?

The royal vizier.

Why, that would be me.

I'm quite sure that...

Desperate times call
for desperate measures, my lord.

Yes. Desperate measures.

I will order the princess to...

But you're so old.

The princess will marry me.

The princess will marry...

-(TRUMPET FANFARE)
- What? What is that?

That music.

(CHUCKUNG)

Jafar, you must come and see this.

(SINGING) Make way for Prince Ali

Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"

Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar

Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star

Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye

Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums

You're gonna love this guy

Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa

Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee

Now, try your best to stay calm

Brush up your Sunday salaam

Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie

Prince Ali, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa

Strong as 10 regular men definitely

He faced the galloping hordes

A hundred bad guys with swords

Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

He's got 75 golden camels

Don't they look lovely, June?

Purple peacocks, he's got 53

Fabulous, Harry. I love the feathers.

Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you

It's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa

That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee

Well, get on out in that square

Adjust your veil and prepare

To gawk and grove! and stare
At Prince Ali

- He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
- He's got the monkeys

- Let's see the monkeys
- And to view them he charges no fee

He's generous
So generous

He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies

They're just lousy with loyalty to All

Prince Ali

Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa

Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see

And that, good people, is why

He got dolled up and dropped by

With 60 elephants, llamas galore

With bears and lions
A brass band and more

With his 40 fakirs
His cooks, his bakers

His birds that warble on key

Make way

For Prince Ali

Splendid. Absolutely marvelous.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Your Majesty,

I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

Prince Ali Ababwa.

Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.

This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.

Ecstatic.

- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.

Whatever.

You cannotjust parade in here
uninvited and expect to...

By Allah,
this is quite a remarkable device.

Ooh.

I don't suppose I might...

Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

Sire, I must advise against this.

Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

Ow, ow, ow.

Ahh! Whoa!

Look out, here I come.

Oh, much farther than
you've traveled, I'm sure.

- Try me.
- SULTAN: Look out, Polly.

Hey, watch it.

Watch it with the dumb rug.

Aah!

WheW!

Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.

Jafar, watch this.

- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.

Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.

This is a very impressive youth.

And a prince besides.

- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.

One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellentjudge of character.

Oh, excellentjudge. Yeah, sure. Not!

SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one.

And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.

Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?

Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

How dare you.

All of you.
Standing around deciding my future?

I am not a prize to be won.

Oh, dear.

Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

I think it's time to say good-bye
to Prince Abubu.

ALADDIN: (SIGHS)
What am I gonna do?

I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

(GROWLING)

So move.

Hey-

That's a good move.

I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

Genie, I need help.

All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

If you wanna court the little lady,
you gotta be a straight shooter.

- Do you got it?
- What?

(READING)

No way.

If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

she'd laugh at me.

A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

I just...
I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.

How do I look?

Like a prince.

(SIGHS)

- ALADDIN: Princess Jasmine?
-(GROWLING)

- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

I do not want to see you.

No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

- JASMINE: Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

So, how's our little beau doing?

- Good kitty, take off.
-(RAJAH GROWLING)

Down, kitty.

Wait. Wait.

Do I know you?

Uh, no. No.

You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

The marketplace?

I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants,

so it couldn't have been me you met.

No. I guess not.

She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.

Anything. Pick a feature.

Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...

Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

-punctual.
- Punctual.

- Punctual?
- Sorry.

- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

Hmm.

I'm rich, too, you know.

- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

I know.

A fine prize for any prince to marry.

Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.

Warning! Warning!

Right. A prince like you.

And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

Mayday! Mayday!

- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

- Yeah, right.
- What?

Uh... Uh, you're right.

(SIGHS) You aren'tjust
some prize to be won.

You should be free
to make your own choice.

I'll go now.

- No!
- What? What?

How...

How are you doing that?

- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

-(KISSES)
- You, uh...

We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

- What?
- Do you trust me?

Yes.

(SINGING) I can show you the world

Shining, shimmering, splendid

Tell me, Princess

Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide

I can open your eyes

Take you wonder by wonder

Over, sideways and under

On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world

A new fantastic point of view

No one to tell us no
Or where to go

Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world

A dazzling place
I never knew

But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear

That now I'm in
A whole new world with you

ALADDIN: Now I'm in
A who/e new world with you

JASMINE: Unbelievable sights

Indescribable feeling

Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

Through an endless diamond sky

- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes

- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better

I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far

I can't go back to where I used to be

- A whole new world
- Every turn a surprise

- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment red-letter

BOTH: I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

Let me share
This whole new world with you

- A whole new world
- A whole new world

- That's where we'll be
- That's where we'll be

- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place

For you and me

- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

Nah. He hates fireworks.

He doesn't like flying, either.

Uh, that is, um... Oh, no.

You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

- Why did you lie to me?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.

I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

Who are you? Tell me the truth.

The truth?

The truth. Um...

The truth is...

But I really am a prince.

Why didn't you just tell me?

Well, you know,

royalty going out into the city
in disguise,

it sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

Hmm.

Not that strange.

Good night, my handsome prince.

Sleep well, Princess.

(SIGHS)

Yes!

(SIGHS)

For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

-(YELLING)
-(STRUGGLING)

(MUFFLED) Abu. Abu.

Hold him.

I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abubu.

(MUFFLED) Why, you...

Make sure he's never found.

(LAUGHING)

Never fails. You get in the bath
and there's a rub at the lamp.

Hello? AI?

(GASPING) AI! Kid, snap out Of it.

You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.

You have to say, "Genie,
I want you to save my life." Got it?

Come on, Aladdin!

I'll take that as a yes.
(IMITATING ALARM)

Up scope.

(BABBLING IN GERMAN)

(couemwe)

Don't you scare me like that.

Genie, I, uh...

L.-

- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.

Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.

(HUMMING)

SULTAN: Jasmine.

Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.

- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

I have chosen a husband for you.

- What?
- You will wed Jafar.

(GASPING)

You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.

I will never marry you.

- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

Better check
your crystal ball again, Jafar.

- Prince Ali!
-(GASPING)

HOW in the... Uh. AWk!

Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

He is obviously lying.

Obviously lying.

Father, what's wrong with you?

I know what's wrong.

Oh, my!

Your Highness,
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

(STAMMERING) What? Jafar?

You, you traitor!

Guards! Guards!

Well, that's it. We're dead. Forget it.

Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.

- SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once.
-(STRUGGLING)

This is not done yet, boy.

-(LAUGHING)
-(COUGHING)

- Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.

Jafar, my most trusted counselor,

plotting against me all this time.

This is horrible, just horrible.

How will I ever...

Huh?

Can this be true?

My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?

Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

You brilliant boy, I could kiss you.

I won't. I'll leave that to my...

But you two will be wed at once.

Yes, yes. And you'll be happy
and prosperous,

and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

- Sultan?
- SULTAN: Yes.

A fine upstanding youth
such as yourself,

a person of your unimpeachable
moral character

is exactly what this kingdom needs.

IAGO: We gotta get outta here.
I gotta start packing. Only essentials.

We gotta travel light.

I think I'm making a weird face in it.

(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!

Good grip-

Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

- He has the lamp, Iago.
- Why, that miserable...

But you are going to relieve him of it.

Me?

Sultan?

They want me to be Sultan?

Huzzah!

(SINGING) Hail the conquering hero

(PATRIOTIC TUNE PLAYS)

Aladdin, you've just won
the heart of the princess.

What are you gonna do next?

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

(WHISPERING) Psst. Your line is,
"I'm going to free the genie."

Any time.

- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.

You just go, "Genie, I wish you free."

I'm serious.

Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.

Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

- Al, you won.
- Because of you.

The only reason anyone thinks
I'm worth anything is because of you.

What if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

I can't wish you free.

Fine. I understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

(smaruwe)

Genie, I'm really sorry.

(RASPBERRY)

Well, fine. Then just stay in there.

What are you guys looking at?

-(WHIMPERING)
-(SNIFFLING)

ALADDIN: Look, I... I'm sorry.

Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

Wait. Come on.

(smaruwe)

What am I doing?

(SIGHS) Genie's right.

I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

JASMINE: Ali. Oh, Ali.
Will you come here?

(SIGHING) Well, here goes.

Jasmine? Where are you?

(IMITATES JASMINE)
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

- I'm coming.
-(PANTING)

(WICKED LAUGHTER)

-(GOOFY CHUCKLE)
- You got a problem, Pinky?

Jerk.

(GLEEFUL CACKLING)

(IMITATES JAFAR)
"Excellent work, Iago."

Ah, go on.

"No, really. On a scale
of one to 10, you are an 11."

Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

People of Agrabah,

my daughter has finally
chosen a suitor.

-(CROWD CHEERING)
- ALADDIN: Jasmine.

Ali, where have you been?

Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.

The whole kingdom's turned out
for Father's announcement.

- You don't understand...
- Good luck.

- SULTAN: Ali Ababwa!
-(CHEERING)

Oh, boy.

(CHEERING)

Look at them,
cheering that little pipsqueak.

Let them cheer.

You know, Al, I'm getting really...

I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al

will be played by a tall, dark
and sinister ugly man.

- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.

Genie, grant me my first wish.

I wish to rule on high as sultan.

- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.

What is this? What's going on?

Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

Father.

(CACKLING)

Jafar, you vile betrayer.

That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.

-(GASPS) The lamp.
-(JAFAR LAUGHS)

Finders keepers, Abubu.

(WHISTLES)

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

Genie, no!

Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.

Jafar, I order you to stop.

Ah, but there's a new order now.

My order.

Finally, you will bow to me.

We will never bow to you.

Why am I not surprised?

If you won't bow before a sultan,

then you will cower before a sorcerer!

Genie, my second wish...

-(JAFAR LAUGHS MANIACALLY)
- Genie, stop!

Ladies and gentlemen,

a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!

Now, where were we?

Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

- Down, boy.
-(MEOWS)

Oh, Princess.

There's someone
I'm dying to introduce you to.

Jafar. Get your hands off her.

(SINGING) Prince Ali
Yes, it is he

But not as you know him

Read my lips
And come to grips with reality

Yes, meet a blast from your past

Whose lies were too good to last

Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali

Or should we say Aladdin?

Ali?

Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just...

So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin

Just a con, need I go on

Take it from me

His personality flaws

Give me adequate cause

To send him packing
On a one-way trip

Genie!

So his prospects
Take a terminal dip

His assets frozen, the venue chosen
ls the ends of the Earth, whoopee!

- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.

Ex-Prince Ali

(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

(WIND HOWLING)

(SHIVERING)

Abu.

Abu!

(ABU WHIMPERING)

Oh, this is all my fault.

I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance.

I'm sorry, Abu.

I made a mess of everything.

Somehow, I gotta go back
and set things right.

Carpet.

-(ABU CHITTERS)
-(ALADDIN STRAINS)

Abu, start digging.

(FRANTIC PANTING)

That's it.

Yeah! All right!

(WHINES)

Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

- IAGO: Puppet ruler want a cracker?
-(SULTAN MOANING)

Here's your cracker. Shove them
all the way down your throat.

Here. Have lots.

Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.

(GROWLING)

It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself

should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world.

What do you say, my dear?

Why, with you as my queen...

- Never.
-(ENRAGED GROWL)

I'll teach you some respect.

(GASPING)

No. Genie.

I have decided to make my final wish.

I wish for Princess Jasmine

to fall desperately in love with me.

JASMINE: Jafar.

I never realized how
incredibly handsome you are.

Mmm. That's better.

Now, pussycat,

tell me more about myself.

You're tall, dark,

well dressed...

AI. AI, little buddy.

Shh.

Al, I can't help you.

I work for Sefior Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?

Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise.

JASMINE: Cute little gaps
between your teeth.

Go on.

And your beard is so twisted.

- You've stolen my heart.
-(GASPING) Jafar...

-(IAGO MUMBLING)
- And the street rat?

What street rat?

-(CLATTERING)
-(GASPING)

(GASPING)

BOTH: Yech!

That was...

You!

How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?

Get the lamp.

No!

Ah, ah, ah, Princess. Your time is up.

(GROWLING)

Jasmine.

Oh, nice shot, Jaf...

Don't toy with me.

Abu!

JAFAR: Things are unravelling
fast now, boy.

(JAFAR LAUGHING)

Get the point?

(LAUGHING)

(STRAINING)

I'm just getting warmed up.

Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

A snake, am I?

Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

(SCREAMING)

(SINGING)
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake

Stick that sword into that snake

You stay out of this.

Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... Great!

JASMINE: Aladdin.

(SCREAMS)

Jasmine, hang on.

(LAUGHING) You little fool.

You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!

The genie. The genie.

The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

What?

He gave you your power.
He can take it away.

Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing rne into this?

Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.

You're right.

His power does exceed my own.

But not for long.

The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

One too many hits with the snake.

Slave, I make my third wish.

I wish to be an all-powerful genie!

All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.

Yes.

Yes!

The power.

-(JAFAR LAUGHS)
-(JASMINE COUGHS)

The absolute power!

- What have you done?
- Trust me.

The universe is mine to command,
to control!

Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie, you got it.

What?

And everything that goes with it.

- No!No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.

ALADDIN:
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

You're the genie. I don't want...

ltty bitty living space.

Al, you little genius, you.

- Ahh!
'(MEOWS)

JAFAR: Get your blasted beak
out of my face.

- IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

Allow me.

(IAGO YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

JAFARI Shut up!

Jasmine...

I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

I know why you did.

Well, I guess this is good-bye?

Oh, that stupid law. This isn't fair.

I love you.

(SNIFFLES) Al, no problem.
You've still got one wish left.

Just say the word
and you're a prince again.

Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.

This is love.

Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.

Believe me, I know. I've looked.

Jasmine, I do love you,

but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

I understand.

Genie, I wish for your freedom.

One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.

- What?
- Genie, you're free.

I'm free. I'm free.

Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.

Say, "I want the Nile."
Wish for the Nile. Try that.

- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!

(LAUGHING GLEEFULLY)

Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

I'm free! I'm free at last!

I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world. I'm...

Genie, I'm...

I'm gonna miss you.

Me, too, Al. (SNIFFLES)

No matter what anybody says,

you'll always be a prince to me.

That's right.

You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

It's that law that's the problem.

- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

From this day forth,

the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

Him. I choose...

I choose you, Aladdin.

Call me Al.

Oh, all of you, come over here.
Big group hug.

Group hug.

Mind if I kiss the monkey?

Ooh, hairball.

Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

I'm outta here!

Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

No, I'm mythology.

I don't care what I am. I'm free!

(SINGING) A who/e new world

A whole new life

For you and me

A whole new world

(LAUGHING)

Made you look.


lt 
begins 
on 
a 
dark 
night. 
Where 
a 
dark 
man 
waits 
with 
a 
dark 
purpose. 
You 
are 
late. 
A 
thousand 
apologies, 
oh 
patient 
one. - 
You 
have 
it, 
then? 
- l 
had 
to 
slit 
a 
few 
throats. 
But 
l 
got 
it. 
The 
treasure. 
Trust 
me, 
my 
pungent 
friend. 
You'll 
get 
whats 
coming 
to 
you. 
Whats
coming 
to 
you. 
Quick, 
follow 
the 
trail. 
Faster. 
At 
last, 
after 
all 
my 
years 
of 
searching. 
The 
cave 
of 
wonders. 
Cave 
of 
wonders. 
By 
Allah. 
Now, 
remember. 
Bring 
me 
the 
lamp. 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
treasure 
is 
yours, 
but 
the 
lamp 
is 
mine. 
The 
lamp. 
The 
lamp. 
Jeez, 
where
did 
you 
dig 
this 
bozo 
up? 
Who 
disturbs 
my 
slumber? 
lt 
is 
l.
Gazeem. 
A 
humble 
thief. 
Know 
this. 
Only 
one 
may 
enter 
here. 
One 
whose 
worth 
lies 
far 
within. 
The 
diamond 
in 
the 
rough. 
What 
are 
you 
waiting 
for? 
Go 
on. 
No! 
Seek 
thee 
out 
the 
diamond 
in 
the 
rough. 
l 
can
not 
believe 
it. 
l 
just 
do
not 
believe 
it. 
We
are 
never 
going 
to 
get 
a 
hold 
of 
that 
stupid 
lamp. 
Just 
forget 
it. 
Look 
at 
this. 
l
am 
so 
ticked 
off 
that 
l
am 
molting. 
Patience, 
lago. 
Patience. 
Gazeem 
was 
obviously 
less 
than 
worthy. 
There
is 
a 
big 
surprise. 
l 
think 
l
am 
gonna 
have 
a 
heart 
attack 
and 
die 
from 
that 
surprise. 
What 
are 
we 
going 
to 
do? 
We 
got 
a 
big 
problem 
here, 
a 
big... 
Yes. 
Only 
one 
may 
enter. 
l 
must 
find 
this 
one, 
this 
diamond 
in 
the 
rough. 

On 
his 
way 
to 
the 
palace, 
l 
suppose. 
Another 
suitor 
for 
the 
princess. 
Out 
of 
my 
way, 
you 
filthy 
brats. 
Hey! 
lf 
l 
were 
as 
rich 
as 
you, 
l 
could 
afford 
some 
manners. 
l
will 
teach 
you 
some 
manners. 
Look 
at 
that, 
Abu. 
lts 
not 
every 
day 
you 
see 
a 
horse 
with 
two 
rear 
ends. 
You 
are 
a 
worthless 
street 
rat. 
You 
were 
born 
a 
street 
rat, 
you'll 
die 
a 
street 
rat 
and 
only 
your 
fleas 
will 
mourn 
you. 
l
am 
not 
worthless. 
And 
l 
don't 
have 
fleas. 
Come 
on, 
Abu. 
Lets 
go 
home. 
Riffraff, 
street 
rat 
l 
don't 
buy 
that 
lf 
only 
they'd 
look 
Closer 
Would 
they 
see 
a 
poor 
boy? 
No 
siree 
They'd 
find 
out 
Theres 
so 
muCh 
more 
to 
me 
Some 
day, 
Abu, 
things 
are 
gonna 
change. 
We'll 
be 
rich, 
live 
in 
a 
palace 
and 
never 
have 
any 
problems 
at 
all. - 
l
have 
never 
been 
so 
insulted. - 
Prince 
Achmed. 
Your
not 
leaving 
so 
soon, 
are 
you? 
Good 
luck 
marrying 
her 
off. 
Jasmine. 
Confound 
it, 
Rajah. 
So 
this 
is 
why 
Prince 
Achmed 
stormed 
out. 
Oh, 
Father. 
Rajah 
was 
just 
playing 
with 
him. 
Weren't 
you, 
Rajah? 
You 
were 
just 
playing 
with 
that 
over
dressed, 
self-
absorbed 
Prince 
Achmed, 
weren't 
you? 
Dearest, 
you've 
got
to 
stop 
rejecting 
every 
suitor 
who 
comes 
to 
call. 
The 
law 
says 
you 
must 
be 
married 
to 
a 
prince 
by 
your 
next 
birthday. - 
The 
law 
is 
wrong. 
- You've 
only 
got 
three 
more 
days. 
Father, 
l 
hate 
being 
forced 
into 
this. 
lf 
l 
do 
marry, 
l 
want 
it 
to 
be 
for 
love. 
Jasmine, 
its 
not 
only 
this 
law. 
lm 
not 
going 
to 
be 
around 
forever, 
and... 
l 
just 
want 
to 
make 
sure 
you're 
taken 
care 
of. 
- Provided 
for. 
- Please 
try 
to 
understand. 
l've 
never 
done 
a 
thing 
on 
my 
own. 
l've 
never 
had 
any 
real 
friends. 
Except 
you, 
Rajah. 
l've 
never 
even 
been 
outside 
the 
palace 
walls. 
But, 
Jasmine, 
you're 
a 
princess. 
Then 
maybe 
l 
don't 
wanna 
be 
a 
princess 
any
more. 
Allah 
forbid 
you 
should 
have 
any 
daughters. 
l 
don't 
know 
where 
she 
gets 
it 
from. 
Her 
mother 
wasn't 
nearly 
so 
picky. 
Jafar, 
my 
most 
trusted 
advisor. 
l 
am 
in 
desperate 
need 
of 
your 
wisdom. 
My 
life 
is 
but 
to 
serve 
you, 
my 
lord. 
lts 
this 
suitor 
business. 
Jasmine 
refuses 
to 
choose 
a 
husband. 
lm 
at 
my 
wits' 
end. 
Wits' 
end. 
Have 
a 
cracker, 
pretty 
Polly. 
Your 
Majesty 
certainly 
has 
a 
way 
with 
dumb 
animals. 
Now, 
then. 
Perhaps 
l 
can 
divine 
a 
solution 
to 
this 
thorny 
problem. 
lf 
anyone 
can 
help, 
its 
you. 
But 
it 
would 
require 
the 
use 
of 
the 
mystic 
blue 
diamond. 
My 
ring? 
- But 
its 
been 
in 
the 
family 
for 
years. - 
lt 
is 
necessary 
to 
find 
a 
suitor. 
Don't 
worry. 
Everything 
will 
be 
fine. 
Everything 
will 
be
fine. 
The 
diamond. 
Here, 
Jafar. 
Whatever 
you 
need 
will
be 
fine. 
You 
are 
most 
gracious, 
my 
liege. 
Now 
run 
along 
and 
play 
with 
your 
little 
toys. 
That 
will 
be 
pretty 
good. 
l 
can't 
take 
it 
anymore. 
lf 
l 
gotta 
choke 
down 
on 
one 
more 
of 
those 
moldy, 
disgusting 
crackers... 
Calm 
yourself,
lago. 
Soon 
l 
will 
be 
sultan, 
not 
that 
addle-
pated 
twit. 
And 
then 
l 
stuff 
the 
crackers 
down 
his 
throat. 

You 
must 
be 
hungry. 
- Here 
you 
go. 
- You 
had 
better 
be 
able 
to 
pay 
for 
that. - 
Pay? 
- No 
one 
steals 
from 
my 
cart. 
l
am 
sorry, 
sir. 
l 
do
not 
have 
any 
money. 
- Thief! 
- Please. 
lf 
you 
let 
me 
go 
to 
the 
palace, 
l 
can 
get 
some 
from 
the 
sultan. 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
the 
penalty 
is 
for 
stealing? 
No, 
please. 
Thank 
you, 
kind 
sir. 
l
am 
so 
glad 
you 
found 
her. 
- l
have
been 
looking 
for 
you. 
- What 
are 
you 
doing? 
- Just 
play 
along. 
- You 
know 
this 
girl? 
Sadly, 
yes. 
She 
is 
my 
sister. 
- She
is 
a 
little 
crazy. 
- She 
said 
she 
knew 
the 
sultan. 
She 
thinks 
the 
monkey 
is 
the 
sultan. 
O 
wise 
Sultan, 
how 
may 
l 
serve 
you? 
Tragic, 
is
not 
it? 
But 
no 
harm 
done. 
Come 
along, 
sis.
Time 
to 
go 
see 
the 
doctor. 
- Hello, 
doctor. 
How 
are 
you? 
- No, 
not 
that 
one. 
Come 
on, 
Sultan. 
What 
is 
it? 
Come 
back 
here, 
you 
little 
thieves. 
With 
all 
due 
respect, 
Your 
Rottenness, 
couldn't 
we 
just 
wait 
for 
a 
real 
storm? 
Save 
your 
breath, 
lago. 
Faster. 
Yes, 
oh 
mighty 
evil 
one. 
Part, 
sands 
of 
time. 
Reveal 
to 
me 
the 
one 
who 
can 
enter 
the 
cave. 
Yes. 
There 
he 
is. 
My 
diamond 
in 
the 
rough. 
Thats 
him? 
Thats 
the 
clown 
we've 
been 
waiting 
for? 
Lets 
have 
the 
guards 
extend 
him 
an 
invitation 
to 
the 
palace. 
- Shall 
we? 
- Swell. 
Almost 
there. 
l 
want 
to 
thank 
you 
for 
stopping 
that 
man. 
Forget 
it. 
So 
this 
is 
your 
first 
time 
in 
the 
market
place, 
huh? 
ls 
it 
that 
obvious? 
Well, 
you
do 
kind 
of 
stand 
out. 
l 
mean, 
you 
do
not 
seem 
to 
know 
how 
dangerous 
Agrabah 
can 
be. 
l
am 
a 
fast 
learner. 
Come 
on. 
This 
way. 
Watch 
your 
head 
there. 
Be 
careful. 
- 
ls 
this 
where 
you 
live? 
- 
Yep. 
Just 
me 
and 
Abu. 
- Come 
and 
go 
as 
we 
please. 
- That 
sounds 
fabulous. 
Well, 
it
is 
not 
much. 
But 
it
has 
got 
a 
great 
view. 
The 
palace 
looks 
pretty 
amazing, 
huh? 
lt
is 
wonder
full. 
Wonder 
what 
it
would 
be 
like 
to 
live 
there. 
And 
have 
servants
and 
valets. 
Oh, 
sure. 
People 
who 
tell 
you 
where 
to 
go 
and 
how 
to 
dress. 
That
is 
better 
than 
here. 
Always 
scraping 
for 
food 
and 
ducking 
guards. 
You
are 
not 
free 
to 
make 
your 
own 
choices. 
- Sometimes 
you 
feel 
so... 
- You
are 
just... 
trapped. 
So 
where 
are 
you 
from? 
What 
does 
it 
matter? 
l 
ran 
away 
and 
l 
am 
not 
going 
back. 
Really? 
How 
come? 
Why, 
you... 
My 
father 
is 
forcing 
me 
to 
get 
married. 
That
is 
awful. 
What? 
Abu says... 
that
is 
not 
fair. 
- 
Oh, 
did 
he? 
- 
Yeah. 
Of 
course. 
And 
does 
Abu 
have 
anything 
else 
to 
say? 
He 
wishes 
there 
was 
something 
he 
could 
do 
to 
help. 
Oh, 
boy. 
Tell 
him 
that
is 
very 
sweet. 
Here 
you 
are. 
They
are 
after 
me. 
They
are 
after 
you? -
 My 
father 
must 
have 
sent 
them... - 
Do 
you 
trust 
me? 
- What? 
- Do 
you 
trust 
me? 
- Yes. 
- Then 
jump! 
We 
just 
keep 
running 
in
to 
each 
other, 
do
not 
we, 
street 
rat? 
Run.
 Go, 
get 
out 
of 
here. 
lt
is 
the 
dungeon 
for 
you, 
boy.  
- Get 
off. 
- Let 
him 
go. 
Looky 
here, 
men. 
A 
street 
mouse. 
Unhand 
him. 
By 
order 
of 
the 
princess. 
- Princess 
Jasmine. 
- The 
princess? 
What 
are 
you 
doing 
here? 
And 
with 
this 
street 
rat? 
Thats 
not 
your 
concern. 
Do 
as 
l 
command. 
Release 
him. 
l 
would, 
Princess. 
Except 
my 
orders 
come 
from 
Jafar. - 
You'll 
have 
to 
take 
it 
up 
with 
him. - 
Believe 
me, 
l 
will.
 
Jafar? 
Princess. 
- How 
may 
l 
be 
of 
service 
to 
you? 
The 
guards 
took 
a 
boy 
from 
the 
market. 
On 
your 
orders. 
Your 
father 
has 
charged 
me 
with 
keeping 
peace 
in 
Agrabah. - 
The 
boy 
was 
a 
criminal. 
- What 
was 
his 
crime? 
- Why... 
- kidnapping 
the 
princess, 
of 
course. - 
He 
didn't 
kidnap 
me. 
l 
ran 
away. 
Oh, 
dear. 
How 
frightfully 
upsetting. 
Had 
l 
but 
known... 
What 
do 
you 
mean? 
Sadly, 
the 
boy's 
sentence 
has 
already 
been 
carried 
out. 
- What 
sentence? 
- Death. 
- By 
beheading. 
- No. 
l 
am 
exceedingly 
sorry, 
Princess. 
How 
could 
you? 
So. 
How 
did 
it
go? 
l 
think 
she 
took 
it 
rather 
well. 
lt
is 
all 
my 
fault, 
Rajah. 
l 
did
not 
even 
know 
his
name. 
She 
was 
the 
princess. 
l 
can
not 
believe 
it. 
l 
must 
have 
sounded 
so 
stupid 
to 
her. 
She 
was 
in 
trouble. 
She 
was 
worth 
it. 
Do
not 
worry 
l 
will 
never 
see 
her 
again. 
l
am 
a 
street 
rat 
remember
and 
there 
is 
a 
law. 
She
has
got 
to 
marry 
a 
prince. 
She 
deserves 
a 
prince. 
l
am 
a 
fool. 
You
are 
only 
a 
fool 
if 
you 
give 
up, 
boy. 
- Who 
are 
you? 
- A 
lowly 
prisoner 
like 
your
self. 
But 
together 
perhaps 
we 
can 
be 
more. - 
l
am 
listening. 
- There 
is 
a 
cave, 
boy. 
A 
cave 
of 
wonders, 
filled 
with 
treasures 
beyond 
your 
wildest 
dreams. 
Treasure 
enough 
to 
impress 
even 
your 
princess, 
l
would 
wager. 
But 
the 
law 
says 
that 
only 
a 
prince... 
Have 
not
you 
heard 
of 
the 
golden 
rule? 
Who
ever 
has 
the 
gold 
makes 
the 
rules. 
So 
why 
would 
you 
share 
this 
treasure 
with 
me? 
l 
need 
a 
young 
pair 
of 
legs 
and 
a 
strong 
back 
to 
go 
in 
after 
it. 
One 
problem. 
lt
is 
out 
there 
and 
we
are 
in 
here.  
Things 
are
not 
always 
what 
they 
seem. 
So. 
Do 
we 
have 
a 
deal? 
Who 
disturbs 
my 
slumber? 
lt 
is 
l. 
Aladdin. 
Proceed. 
Touch 
nothing 
but 
the 
lamp. 
Remember, 
boy. 
First 
fetch 
me 
the 
lamp. 
And 
then 
you 
shall 
have 
your 
reward. 

- Help 
me 
up. 
- Throw 
me 
the 
lamp. 
l 
can't 
hold 
on. 
Give 
me 
your 
hand. 
First 
give 
me 
the 
lamp. 
Yes! 
At 
last. 
- What 
are 
you 
doing? 
- Giving 
you 
your 
reward. 
Your 
eternal 
reward. 
lt's 
mine. 
lt's 
all 
mine. 
l
... 
where 
is 
it? 
No. 
No! 

Oh, 
dearest. 
What
is 
wrong? 
Jafar 
has 
done 
something 
terrible. 
there 
there, 
my 
dear. 
We
will 
set 
it 
right. 
Now, 
tell 
me 
everything. 

That 
two-
faced 
son 
of 
a 
jackal. 
Well, 
whoever 
he 
was, 
he
is 
long 
gone 
with 
that 
lamp. 
Why, 
you 
hairy 
little 
thief. 
lt 
looks 
like 
such 
a 
beat-
up, 
worth
less 
piece 
of 
junk. 
l 
think 
there
is 
something 
writ
ten 
here, 
but 
it's 
hard 
to 
make 
out. 
Ten 
thousand 
years 
will 
give 
you 
such 
a 
crick 
in 
the 
neck. 

You
are 
smaller 
than 
my 
last 
master. 
Wait 
a 
minute. 
l
am 
your 
master? 
That
is 
right. 
He 
can 
be 
taught. 
What 
would 
you 
wish 
of 
me? 
Genie 
of 
the 
Lamp. 
Right 
here 
for 
your 
very 
much 
wish-
fulfillment. 
Thank you. 
- Wish-
fulfillment? 
- Three, 
to 
be 
exact. 
lx-
nay 
on 
the 
wishing 
for
more 
wishes. 
That
is 
it. 
Three. 
No 
substitutions, 
exchanges 
or 
refunds. 
- You 
do
not 
realize 
what 
you 
got
here. 
 So 
why 
do
not 
you 
just 
ruminate 
whilst 
l 
illuminate 
the 
possibilities? 
So 
what
will 
it 
be, 
Master? 
You
are 
gonna 
grant 
me 
any 
three 
wishes 
l 
want, 
right? 
Almost. 
There 
are 
a 
few 
provisos, 
a 
couple 
of 
quid 
pro
quos. 
Like? 
Rule 
one. 
l 
can
not 
kill 
any
body. 
So 
do
not 
ask. 
Rule 
two. 
l can
not 
make 
anybody 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
any
body 
else. 
You 
little 
punim 
there. 
Rule 
three. 
l 
can
not 
bring 
people 
back 
from 
the 
dead. 
lt
is 
not 
a 
pretty 
picture. 
l 
do
not 
like 
doing 
it. 
Other
than 
that, 
you 
got 
it. 
Provisos? 
You 
mean 
limitations? 
On wishes? 
Some 
all-
powerful 
genie! 
Can
not 
even 
bring 
people 
back 
from 
the 
dead. 
l 
do
not 
know. 
He 
probably 
can
not 
even 
get 
us 
out 
of 
this 
cave. 

Jafar, 
this 
is 
an
outrage. 
lf 
it 
weren't 
for 
all 
your 
years 
of 
loyal 
service... 
From 
now 
on, 
you
are 
to 
discuss 
sentencing 
of 
prisoners 
with 
me. 
Before 
they 
are 
beheaded. 
l 
assure 
you, 
Your 
Highness, 
it 
won't 
happen 
again. 
Jasmine, 
Jafar, 
now 
lets 
put 
this 
whole 
messy 
business 
behind 
us. 
Please. 
My 
most 
abject 
and 
humblest 
apologies 
to 
you 
as 
well, 
Princess. 
At 
least 
some 
good 
will
 come 
of 
my 
being 
forced 
to 
marry. 
When 
l 
am 
queen, 
l 
will 
have 
the 
power 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
you. 
Thats 
nice. 
All 
settled, 
then. 
Now, 
Jasmine, 
getting 
back 
to 
this 
suitor 
business... 
Jasmine! 
lf 
only 
l 
had 
gotten 
that 
lamp. 
''l 
will 
have 
the 
power 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
you.'' 
To 
think 
we 
gotta 
keep 
kissing 
up 
to 
that 
chump 
and 
his 
chump 
daughter 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
our 
lives. 
No, 
lago. 
Only 
until 
she 
finds 
a 
chump 
husband. 
Then 
she
will
 have 
us 
banished. 
Or 
beheaded. 
Wait 
a 
minute. 
What 
if 
you 
were 
the 
chump 
husband? 
What? 
You 
marry 
the 
princess, 
right? 
And 
then 
you 
become 
the 
sultan. 
Marry 
the 
shrew. 
l 
become 
the 
sultan. 
The 
idea 
has 
merit. 
Yes, 
merit. 
And 
then 
we 
drop 
poppa-
in-
law 
and 
the 
little 
woman 
off 
a 
cliff. 
l 
love 
the 
way 
your 
foul 
little 
mind 
works. 

Well, 
how 
about 
that, 
Mr. 
Doubting 
Mustafa? 
You 
sure 
showed 
me. 
Now 
about 
my 
three 
wishes... 
Dost 
mine 
ears 
deceive 
me? 
Three? 
You 
are 
down 
by
 one, 
boy. 
No, 
l 
never 
actually 
wished 
to 
get 
out 
of
 the 
cave. 
You 
did 
that 
on 
your 
own. 
l 
feel 
sheepish. 
All 
right, 
you 
bad 
boy. 
But 
no 
more 
freebies. 
Fair 
deal. 
Three 
wishes. 
l 
want 
them 
to 
be 
good. 
What 
would 
you 
wish 
for? 
Me? 
No 
one
has 
asked 
me 
that 
before. 
Well, 
in 
my 
case... 
- 
Forget 
it. 
- What? 
- l 
can
not 
tell 
you. 
- Come 
on. 
Freedom. 
- You
are 
a 
prisoner? 
- lt
is 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
genie 
gig. 
Phenomenal 
cosmic 
powers. 
- ltty-
bitty 
living 
space. 
- Genie, 
that
is 
terrible. 
But 
oh, 
to 
be 
free. 
Not 
to 
have 
to 
go, 
''What 
do 
you 
need?'' 
To 
be 
my 
own 
master. 
Such 
a 
thing 
would 
be 
greater 
than 
all 
the 
magic
and 
treasures 
in 
the 
world. 
But 
what 
am 
l 
talking 
about? 
lts 
not 
going 
to 
happen. 
- 
Wake 
up. 
- Why 
not? 
The 
only 
way 
l 
get 
out 
of
 this 
is 
if 
my 
master
 wishes 
me 
out. 
So 
you 
can 
guess 
how 
often
 thats 
happened. 
l'll
 do 
it. 
l'll 
set 
you 
free. 
Yeah, 
right. 
l 
promise. 
After 
my 
first 
two 
wishes, 
l'll 
use 
my 
third 
wish 
to 
set 
you 
free. 
Well, 
heres
hoping. 
Lets 
make 
some 
magic. 
So 
how 
about 
it? 
What 
is 
it 
you 
want 
most? 
Well, 
theres 
this 
girl. 
Wrong. 
l 
can't 
make 
anybody 
fall 
in 
love, 
remember? 
But, 
Genie, 
shes 
smart 
and 
fun 
and... 
- Pretty? 
- Beautiful. 
Shes 
got 
these 
eyes 
that 
just... 
and 
this 
hair. 
And 
her 
smile... 
But 
shes 
the 
princess. 
To 
even 
have 
a 
chance, 
l
would 
have 
to 
be...
 - 
Can 
you 
make 
me 
a 
prince? 
- Lets 
see. 
''To 
make 
a 
prince.'' 
ls 
that 
official? 
Say 
the 
magic 
words. 
Genie, 
l 
wish 
for 
you 
to 
make 
me 
a 
prince. 

Hes 
got 
the 
outfit, 
hes 
got 
the 
elephant, 
but 
were
not 
through 
yet. 
Hang 
on 
to 
your 
turban, 
kid. 
Were 
gonna 
make 
you 
a 
star. 

Sire, 
l 
have 
found 
a
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
with 
your 
daughter. 
The 
problem 
with 
your 
daughter. - 
Really? 
- Right 
here. 
lf 
the 
princess 
has 
not 
chosen 
a 
husband 
by 
the 
appointed 
time, 
then 
the 
sultan 
shall 
choose 
for 
her. 
But 
Jasmine 
hated 
all 
those 
suitors. 
How 
could 
l 
choose 
someone 
she 
hates? 
Not 
to 
worry, 
my 
liege. 
There 
is 
more. 
lf 
in 
the 
event 
a 
suitable 
prince 
cannot 
be 
found, 
a 
princess 
must 
then 
be 
wed 
to... - 
lnteresting. 
- What? 
Who? 
The 
royal 
vizier. 
That 
would 
be... 
...me. 
But 
l 
thought 
only 
a 
prince 
can 
marry 
a 
princess. 
l
am 
quite 
sure. 
Desperate 
times 
call 
for 
desperate 
measures, 
my 
lord. 
Desperate 
measures. 
You 
will 
order 
the 
princess 
to 
marry 
me. 
l 
will 
order 
the 
princess 
to... 
But 
your
so 
old. 
The 
princess 
will 
marry 
me. 
The 
princess 
will
marry... 
What 
is 
that? 
That 
music? 
Jafar, 
you 
must 
come 
and 
see 
this. 
Splendid. 
Absolutely 
marvelous. 
Your 
Majesty, 
l 
have 
journeyed 
from 
afar
to 
seek 
your 
daughter's 
hand. 
Prince 
Ali 
Ababwa. 
Of 
course. 
lm 
delighted 
to 
meet 
you. 
This 
is 
my 
royal 
vizier, 
Jafar. 
Hes 
delighted 
too. 
Ecstatic. 
- lm 
afraid, 
Prince 
Abubu... 
- Ababwa. 
What
ever. 
You 
cannot 
just 
parade 
in 
here 
uninvited 
and 
expect 
to...
By 
Allah, 
this 
is 
quite 
a 
remarkable 
device. 
l 
do 
not 
suppose 
l 
might... 
Why 
certainly, 
Your 
Majesty. 
Allow 
me. 
Sire. 
l 
must 
advise 
against 
this. 
Oh, 
button 
up, 
Jafar. 
Learn 
to 
have 
a 
little 
fun. 
Just 
where 
did 
you 
say 
you 
were 
from?  
Much 
farther 
than 
you
have 
traveled, 
l
am 
sure. 
- Try 
me. 
- Duck, 
Polly. 
Watch 
it, 
you 
dumb 
rug. 
Have 
a 
cracker. 
Out 
the 
way, 
lm 
coming 
in 
to 
land. 
Jafar, 
watch 
this. 
- Spectacular, 
Your 
Highness. 
- lt 
was 
lovely. 
Yes, 
l 
do 
seem 
to 
have 
a 
knack 
for 
it. 
This 
is 
a 
very 
impressive 
youth. 
And 
a 
prince 
besides. 
lf 
we're 
lucky, 
you 
won't 
have 
to 
marry 
Jasmine 
after 
all. 
- l 
don't 
trust 
him, 
sire. 
- Nonsense. 
One 
thing 
l 
pride 
myself 
on. 
l
am 
an 
excellent 
judge 
of 
character. 
Oh, 
excellent 
judge, 
yeah, 
sure. 
Not. 
Jasmine 
will 
like 
this 
one. 
And 
lm 
sure 
l
will 
like 
Princess 
Jasmine. 
Your 
Highness, 
no. 
l 
must 
intercede 
on 
Jasmine's 
behalf. 
This 
boy 
is 
no 
different 
from 
the 
others. 
What 
makes 
him 
think 
he 
is 
worthy
of
the
princess? 
Your 
Majesty, 
l 
am 
Prince 
Ali 
Ababwa. 
Just 
let 
her 
meet 
me. 
l 
will 
win 
your 
daughter. 
How 
dare 
you? 
All 
of 
you. 
Standing 
around 
deciding 
my 
future? 
l 
am 
not 
a 
prize 
to 
be 
won. 
Oh, 
dear. 
Don't 
worry, 
Prince 
Ali. 
Just 
give 
Jasmine 
time 
to 
cool 
down. 
l 
think 
its 
time 
to 
say 
good
bye 
to 
Prince 
Abubu. 
What 
am 
l 
going 
to 
do? 
Jasmine 
will
not 
even 
let 
me 
talk 
to 
her. 
l 
should 
have 
known 
l 
could
not 
pull 
off 
this 
stupid 
prince 
wish. 
Genie, 
l 
need 
help. 
- All 
right, 
sparky, 
here
is 
the 
deal. 
lf 
you 
want 
to 
court 
the 
lady, 
you 
got 
to 
be 
a 
straight 
shooter. 
Do 
ya 
got 
it? 
What? 
Tell 
her 
the 
truth. 
No 
way. 
lf 
Jasmine 
found 
out 
l 
was 
some 
crummy 
street 
rat, 
she 
would 
laugh 
at 
me. 
A 
woman 
appreciates 
a 
man 
who 
can 
make 
her 
laugh. 
Al, 
all 
joking 
aside, 
you 
really 
ought 
to 
be 
yourself.
 That
is 
the 
last 
thing 
l 
want 
to 
be. 
Ok, 
l
am 
going 
to 
go 
see 
her. 
l 
got 
to 
be 
smooth, 
cool, 
confident. 
How 
do 
l 
look? 
Like 
a 
prince. 
Princess 
Jasmine? 
- Who
is 
there? 
- lt
is 
me, 
Prince 
Ali
Ababwa. 
- l 
do 
not 
want 
to 
see 
you. 
- Please, 
Princess. 
Give 
me 
a 
chance. - 
Leave 
me 
alone. 
- Down, 
kitty. 
So 
how
is 
our 
little 
beau 
doing? 
Good 
kitty. 
Take 
off. 
- Down, 
kitty. 
- Wait. 
Do 
l 
know 
you? 
No. 
You 
remind 
me 
of 
someone 
l 
met 
in 
the 
market
place. 
The 
market
place? 
l 
have 
servants 
who 
go 
to 
the 
market
place 
for 
me. 
Why, 
l 
even 
have 
servants 
who 
go 
to 
the 
marketplace 
for 
my 
servants. 
So 
it 
could
not 
have 
been 
me 
you 
met. 
No. 
- l 
guess 
not. 
- 
Enough 
about 
you. 
Talk 
about
her.  
She
is 
smart, 
fun. 
The 
hair, 
the 
eyes. 
Any
thing. 
Pick 
a 
feature. 
Princess 
Jasmine, 
you
are 
very... 
Wonderful. 
Magnificent. 
Punctual. 
- Punctual. 
- Sorry. 
- Beautiful. 
- Nice 
recovery. 
- l
am 
rich 
too, 
you 
know. 
- Yeah. 
- The 
daughter 
of 
a 
sultan. 
- l 
know. 
A 
fine 
prize 
for 
any 
prince 
to 
marry. 
Right. 
A 
prince 
like 
me. 
- Warning. 
- Right. 
A 
prince 
like 
you. 
And 
every 
other 
stuffed
shirt, 
swaggering 
peacock 
l've 
met. 
May
day. 
Just 
go 
jump 
off 
a 
balcony. 
- Stop 
her. 
Want 
me 
to 
sting 
her? 
-buzz
off!
fine
but
remember
bee 
yourself.
yeah 
right.
- What? 
You
are 
right. 
You 
are
not 
just 
some 
prize 
to 
be 
won. 
You 
should 
be 
free 
to 
make 
your 
own 
choice. 
l
will 
go. 
- No. 
- What? 
How... 
- How 
are 
you 
doing 
that? 
- lt
is 
a 
magic 
carpet. 
lt
is 
lovely. 
You... 
You 
do
not 
want 
to 
go 
for 
a 
ride, 
do 
you? 
We 
could 
get 
out
of 
the 
palace. 
See 
the 
world. 
- ls 
it 
safe? 
- Sure. 
Do 
you 
trust 
me? 
- What? 
- Do 
you 
trust 
me? 
Yes. 
- lt
is 
all 
so 
magical. 
- Yeah. 
- lt
is 
all 
so 
magical. 
- Yeah. 
lt
is 
a 
shame 
Abu 
had 
to 
miss 
this. 
He 
hates 
fire
works. 
He 
does
not 
really 
like 
flying 
either. 
That 
is... 
- Oh, 
no. 
- You 
are 
the 
boy 
from 
the 
market. - 
l 
knew 
it! 
Why 
did 
you 
lie
to 
me? - 
l
am 
sorry. 
Did 
you 
think 
l 
was 
stupid? 
That 
l 
would
not 
figure 
it 
out? 
No, 
l 
mean... 
l 
hoped 
you 
would
not. - 
That
is 
not 
what 
l 
meant. 
- Who 
are 
you? 
Tell 
me 
the 
truth. 
The 
truth? 
The 
truth... 
The 
truth 
is, 
l 
some
times 
dress 
as 
a 
commoner. 
To 
escape 
the 
pressures 
of 
palace 
life. 
But 
l 
really 
am 
a 
prince. 
Why 
did
not 
you 
just 
tell 
me? 
Well, 
you 
know. 
Royalty 
going 
out 
into 
the 
city 
in 
disguise. 
Sounds 
a 
little 
strange, 
do
not 
you 
think? 
Not 
that 
strange. 
Good 
night, 
my 
handsome 
prince. 
Sleep 
well, 
Princess. 
Yes! 
For 
the 
first 
time 
in 
my 
life, 
things 
are 
starting 
to 
go 
right. 
Hold 
him. 
lm 
afraid 
you've 
worn 
out 
your 
welcome, 
Prince 
Abubu. 
- Why 
you 
dirty, 
rotten... 
- Make 
sure 
hes 
never 
found. 
Never 
fails. 
Get 
in 
the 
bath 
and 
theres 
a 
rub 
at
the 
lamp. 
Hello? 
Al? 
Kid, 
snap 
out 
of 
it. 
l 
can't 
help 
you 
unless 
you 
make 
a 
wish. 
You 
have 
to 
say, 
''Genie, 
l 
want 
you 
to 
save 
my 
life.''
OK? 
Come 
on, 
Aladdin. 
l'll 
take 
that 
as 
a 
yes. 
Up 
scope. 
Don't 
you 
scare 
me 
like 
that. 
Genie, 
l... 
- Thanks, 
Genie. 
- Oh, 
Al. 
lm 
getting 
kind 
of 
fond 
of 
you, 
kid. 
Not 
that 
l

pick 
out 
curtains. 
Oh, 
Father. 
l

the 
most 
wonderful 
time. - 
lm 
so 
happy. 
- You 
should 
be, 
Jasmine. 
l 
have
chosen 
a 
husband 
for 
you. - 
What? 
- You 
will 
wed 
Jafar. 
You
are 
speechless, 
l 
see. 
A 
fine 
quality 
in 
a 
wife. 
l 
will 
never 
marry 
you. 
- Father, 
l 
choose 
Prince 
Ali. 
- 
Prince 
Ali 
left. 
Better 
check 
your 
crystal 
ball 
again. - 
Prince 
Ali. 
- How 
in 
the... 
Tell 
them 
the 
truth, 
Jafar. 
You 
tried 
to 
have 
me 
killed. 
What 
ridiculous 
nonsense, 
Your 
Highness. 
He
is 
obviously 
lying. 
Obviously 
lying. 
- Father, 
whats 
wrong 
with 
you? - 
l 
know 
whats 
wrong. 
- Oh, 
my. 
- Your 
Highness. 
Jafar's 
been 
controlling 
you 
with 
this. 
What? 
Jafar? 
You 
low 
traitor. 
Your 
Majesty, 
all 
this 
can 
be 
explained. - 
Guards. 
- Well, 
thats 
it. 
We're 
dead. 
Just 
dig 
a 
grave 
for 
both 
of 
us. 
Arrest 
Jafar 
at 
once. 
This 
is 
not 
done 
yet, 
boy. 
Find 
him. 
Search 
everywhere. 
- Jasmine, 
are 
you 
all 
right? 
- Yes. 
Jafar, 
my 
most 
trusted 
counselor, 
plotting 
against 
me 
all 
this 
time. 
This 
is 
horrible, 
just 
horrible. 
How 
will 
l 
ever... 
Can 
this 
be 
true? 
My 
daughter
has 
finally 
chosen 
a 
suitor? 
Praise 
Allah. 
You 
brilliant 
boy. 
l 
could 
kiss 
you. 
l 
will
not. 
l
will 
leave 
that 
to 
my... 
But 
you 
two 
will 
be 
wed 
at 
once. 
Yes, 
and 
you
will 
be 
happy 
and 
prosperous. 
And 
then 
you, 
my 
boy, 
will 
become 
sultan. 
- Sultan? 
- Yes. 
A 
fine 
youth 
such 
as 
yourself. 
A 
person 
of 
your 
unimpeachable 
moral 
character 
is 
exactly 
what 
this 
kingdom 
needs. 
We 
gotta 
get 
outta 
here. 
l 
gotta 
start 
packing. 
Only 
essentials. 
We 
gotta 
travel 
light. 
Bring 
the 
guns, 
the knives... 
And 
how 
about 
this 
picture? 
l 
don't 
know. 
l 
think 
lm 
making 
a 
weird 
face. 
Oh, 
boy. 
Hes 
cracked. 
Hes 
gone 
nuts. 
Get 
a 
grip. 
Good 
grip. 
Prince 
Ali 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
that 
ragged
urchin 
Aladdin. 
He 
has 
the 
lamp, 
lago. 
- Why, 
that 
miserable... 
- But 
you 
will 
relieve 
him 
of 
it. 
Me? 
Sultan? 
They 
want 
me 
to 
be 
sultan? 
Hail 
the 
Conquering 
hero 
You've 
just 
won 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
princess. 
What 
are 
you 
gonna 
do 
next? 
Your 
line 
is, 
''lm 
going 
to 
free 
the 
genie.'' - 
Any 
time. 
- Genie... 
- l 
can't. 
- Sure 
you 
can. 
You 
just 
go, 
''Genie, 
l 
wish 
you 
free.'' 
lm 
serious. 
Look, 
lm 
sorry, 
l 
really 
am. 
But 
they 
wanna
make 
me 
sultan. 
No, 
they 
wanna 
make 
Prince 
Ali 
sultan. 
Without 
you, 
lm 
just 
Aladdin. 
- 
Al, 
you 
won. 
- Because 
of 
you. 
People 
only 
think 
lm 
worth 
anything 
because 
of 
you. 
What 
if 
they 
find 
out 
lm 
not 
a 
prince? 
What 
if 
Jasmine 
finds 
out? 
l'd 
lose 
her. 
l 
can't 
keep 
this 
up 
on 
my 
own. 
l 
can't 
wish 
you 
free. 
l 
understand. 
After 
all, 
you've
lied 
to 
everyone 
else. 
l 
was 
beginning 
to 
feel 
left 
out. 
Now, 
if 
you'll 
excuse 
me, 
master. 
Genie, 
lm 
really 
sorry. 
Well, 
fine. 
Then 
just 
stay 
in 
there. 
What 
are 
you 
guys 
looking 
at? 
Look, 
l... 
Abu, 
lm 
sorry. 
l 
didn't... 
Wait. 
Come 
on. 
What 
am 
l 
doing? 
Genies

l 
gotta 
tell 
Jasmine 
the 
truth. 
Ali, 
will 
you 
come 
here? 
Here 
goes. 
Jasmine, 
where 
are 
you? 
- Out 
in 
the 
menagerie. 
Hurry. 
- lm

You

a 
problem, 
pinky? 
Jerk. 
Jafars
gonna 
be 
happy 
to 
see 
you.  
- Excellent 
work, 
lago. 
- Ah, 
go 
on. 
No, 
really. 
On 
a 
scale 
of 
one 
to 
ten, 
you 
are 
an 
eleven. 
Oh, 
Jafar, 
your 
too 
kind. 
lm 
embarrassed. 
lm 
blushing. 
People 
of 
Agrabah, 
my 
daughter 
has 
finally 
chosen 
a 
suitor. 
- He 
is 
a 
man 
of 
integrity. 
- Jasmine? 
Ali, 
where 
you 
have 
you 
been? 
Theres 
something 
l 
gotta 
tell 
you. 
The 
whole 
kingdom 
has 
turned 
out 
for 
Father's 
announcement. 
Jasmine, 
listen 
to 
me. 
Please, 
you 
dont 
understand. 
- Good 
luck. 
- Prince 
Ali 
Ababwa. 
Look 
at 
them. 
Cheering 
that 
little 
pipsqueak. 
Let 
them 
cheer. 
You 
know, 
Al, 
l

really... 
l 
dont

Tonight 
the 
part 
of 
Al 
will 
be 
played
by 
a 
tall, 
dark 
and 
sinister 
ugly 
man. - 
l 
am 
your 
master 
now. 
- l 
was 
afraid 
of 
that. 
Genie, 
grant 
me 
my 
first 
wish. 
l 
wish 
to 
rule 
on 
high. 
As 
sultan. 
Bless 
my 
soul. 
What 
is 
this? 
Whats

on? - 
Oh, 
my 
goodness. 
What
is 
happening?
 - Father! 
Jafar, 
you 
vile 
betrayer. 
Thats
Sultan 
Vile 
Betrayer 
to 
you. 
Oh, 
yeah? 
We'll

The

- Finders 
keepers, 
Abubu. 
Genie,

Sorry,

new 
master

Jafar,

But

a
new 
order 
now. 
My 
order. 
Finally 
you 
will 
bow 
to 
me. 
We 
will 
never 
bow 
to 
you. 
Why 
am 
l 
not 
surprised? 
lf 
you 
wont 
bow 
be
for
a 
sultan, 
then 
you 
will 
cower 
before 
a 
sorcerer. 
Genie, 
my 
second 
wish. 
l 
wish 
to 
be 
the 
most 
powerful 
sorcerer 
in 
the 
world. 
Genie,

Ladie
and 
gentlemen,

warm 
Agrabah 
welcome 
for 
sorcerer 
Jafar. 
Now,

Oh, 
Princess. 
There

This

chance. 
Are

Jafar,

him 
alone. 
lt 
pains
me 
to 
see 
you 
reduced 
to 
this, 
Jasmine. 
A 
beautiful 
desert 
bloom 
such 
as 
yourself 
should 
be 
on 
the 
arm 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
man 
in 
the 
world. 
What 
do 
you 
say,

Why,

queen... 
Never.

respect. 
No.

my 
final 
wish. 
l 
wish 
for 
Princess 
Jasmine 
to 
fall 
desperately 
in 
love 
with 
me. 
Master,

few 
addendas, 
some 
quid 
pro 
quo. 
Dont

to
me, 
you

blue 
lout. 
You 
will

Thats

Now,

about

You're

Well-
dressed. 
Al. 
Little

you 
gonna 
do? 
-

street 
rat,

improvise. 
- Cute 
little 
gaps 
between 
your 
teeth. 
Go 
on. 
And 
your 
beard 
is 
so... 
twisted. 
You've 
stolen 
my 
heart. 
And 
the 
street 
rat? 
What 
street 
rat? 
That 
was... 
You. 
How 
many 
times

you, 
boy? 
Get

lamp. 
No. 
Princess,

time

Nice 
shot, 
Jafar. 
Dont 
toy 
with 
me. 
Things

unraveling 
fast 
now, 
boy. 
Get 
the 
point? 
lm 
just 
getting 
warmed 
up. 
Are 
you 
afraid 
to 
fight 
me 
yourself, 
you 
cowardly 
snake? 
A 
snake, 
am 
l?

Squeeze

Without

- What!?

your

Face

Jafar.

Your

His 
power

But

To

You

Aladdin
FADE IN:
BEGIN TITLES: the song ARABIAN NIGHTS, sung over scenes of·the
desert and the city of AGRABAH, in all its exotic splendor.
NARRATOR
OH I COME FROM A LAND FROM A FARAWAY PLACE
WHERE THE CARAVAN CAMELS ROAM
WHERE THEY'LL CUT OFF YOUR EAR IF THEY DON'T LIKE
YOUR FACE
IT'S BARBARIC BUT HEY -- IT'S HOME
WHEN THE WINDS FROM THE EAST
AND THE SUN'S FROM THE WEST
AND THE SAND IN THE GLASS IS RIGHT
COME ON DOWN STOP ON BY
HOP A CARPET AND FLY
IT'S ANOTHER ARABIAN NIGHT
ARABIAN NIGHTS
LIKE ARABIAN DAYS
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
ARE HOTTER THAN HOT
IN A LOTTA GOOD WAYS
EXT. AGRABAH - BAZAAR - EVENING
END TITLES as THE NARRATOR, a street vendor, rides a heavilyladen camel through the bazaar, the CLOMP CLOMP of the camel's
hooves falling in beat with the song.
NARRATOR ... ARABIAN NIGHTS
'NEATH ARABIAN MOONS
A FOOL OFF HIS GUARD
COULD FALL AND FALL HARD
OUT THERE ON THE DUNES ...
The camel kneels and the Narrator slides off with~ flourish.
He brightens, noticing. the audience, speaks into camera:
NARRATOR
Salaam and good evening to yo.u,
worthy friend! Please ... come
closer ... Welcome to Agrabah! A city
of mystery ... of enchantment ... of
the finest ceramics this side of
the River Jordan ...
He whips a jug from off the· camel's back, displays it. Noticing
a crack, quickly rotates it around to hide the flaw.
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
No? Then perhaps this elegantly appointed fr.uit basket would be
more to your liking .. ?
He nods his head hopefully, but the nod turns into a headshake.

0 NARRATOR
Ah ... I can see that you are only
interested in the exceptionally
rare ... I think, then, you would
be most rewarded to consider ...
.t..hi.s. !
He displays a lamp: old, dented, dust-covered.
NARRATOR
Do not be fooled by its
commonplace appearance ... like so
many things, it is not what is
outside, but what is inside# that
counts. This is no ordinary lamp--
2.
The camera's interest in the lamp wanes, starts to turn away.
NARRATOR
(enticing, teasing)
It once contained a magical Genie
of great power ... (camera comes back; the
Narrator smiles) Ah, that interests you. Perhaps
you would like to hear the tale.
But it doesn't begin with the
lamp.
The Narrator pours glitter from the lamp ... tosses a fistful up
into the sky. The glitter becomes stars.
NARRATOR ( 0 •:S • )
It begins on a dark night--
We slowly PAN DOWN from the star-filled sky to reveal--
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
A silhouetted figure on horseback. Motionless, it looks as
though he has been waiting on those silent dunes for a thousand
years.
NARRATOR (O.S.)
--where a dark man waits ...
His name is JAFFAR. His mind works the way he looks: all long lines and deep sharp angles.
NARRATOR (0. S.)
... with a dark purpose ...
A rider nears, reins up: a grimy, shifty THIEF.
JAFAR
You are late.

':...a.. '•·~, I
THIEF
A thousand apologies, O patient
one.
JAFAR
You have it then?
3.
With a grin, the Thief produces half of a SCARAB MEDALLION.
Jafar reaches for it. The Thief holds it out of reach.
THIEF
I had to slit a few throats ... (smug)
Ah-ah. The treasure .. ?
Suddenly there is a screech--IAGO, Jafar's parrot companion,
swoops in ... RIPS the scarab from the Thief's fingers.
Iago lands on Jafar's shoulder, drops the scarab into a pleased
Jafar's hand.
The Thief sucks his bleeding fingers, no longer smug.
JAFAR
Trust me, my pungent friend.
You'll get what's corning to you.
IAGO
What's coming to you--awk!
Jafar reaches into his robe. Produces the other half of the
scarab. He's waited for this moment for a long time. He .fill
the halves together--
Thunder BOOMS--the scarab GLOWS--then LEAPS from Jafar's hands,
STREAKS away across the dunes.
JAFAR
Quickly! Follow the trail!
Jafar spurs his steed, races after it. Iago is thrown from his
perch. He squawks and flies after him. , Jafar and the Thief race after the scarab.
JAFAR
Faster!
The scarab streaks up to a small sandstone outcropping. The
scarab traces a pattern around the stone--then SPLITS. The
halves insert themselves in two notches in the stone. They look
like glowing pupils in a huge pair of eyes.
Jafar reins up, dismounts anxiously. Shouts an incantation.
JAFAR
SIM SALAH BIM!
The eyes flash. The earth trembles. A huge TIGER HEAD rises up,
formed from the sand itself. A BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT blasts out
of the mouth of the cave.

Jafar is awed.
JAFAR
At last! After all my years of
searching--The Cave of Wonders ...
IAGO
Cave of Wonders!
Jafar pushes the Thief forward.
JAFAR
Remember--bring me the lamp. The
rest of the treasure is yours--
but the .J..am.'2. ••• is zniru!,
The Thief steps forward warily ... onto the Tiger's lip.
IAGO
The lamp! Squawk!
And then a revelation: Alone with Jafar, Iago is smart,
articulate-- and short-tempered. He whispers to Jafar:
IAGO
Geez ... you just can't find good
help nowadays ...
Suddenly--
TIGER-GOD
WHO DISTURBS MY SLUMBER?
The Thief jumps back.
THIEF
Er .. it is I ... Gazeem, a humble
thief.
TIGER-GOD
KNOW THIS! ONLY QHE. MAY ENTER
WHOM I DEEM WISE ENOUGH.
ONE WHOSE WORTH LIES DEEP WITHIN;
THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.
4.
The Thief looks back at Jafar, who acts like there is no danger.
JAFAR
What are you waiting for? Go on!
In the cave's mouth, stairs lead down. The Thief takes them,
descending, out of view.
Jafar and Iago wait.
JAFAR
Well?
0
\("/•-j· . .,
'--
5.
There is no response ... then suddenly, the light from inside the
cave becomes brighter.
THIEF (O.S.) Oh .. !
JAFAR
Yes? Do you see the lamp?
Jafar leans closer, shielding his eyes, trying to see. Iago peeks out from behind a wing.
THIEF (O.S.) ... It's ... wonderful!
JAFAR
Bring it to me!
THIEF (O.S.)
I've got it! I've--AIIEEAUGGGH--
With a ROAR, the Tiger's mouth SLAMS DOWN--
JAFAR
NO!
Jafar leaps clear--
The Tiger's head begins to dissolve back ~nto the sand--
TIGER-GOD
(fading)
SEEK THEE OUT ... THE DIAMOND IN
THE ROUGH ...
--until only the sandstone outcropping remains. The scarab
halves stop glowing, drop into the sand.
Jafar stares. Iago surfaces, spits out sand.
IAGO
I can't believe it! We're never
gonna get ahold_of that tinpot
lamp! Look at this--I'm so ticked
off, I'm molting!
He flaps over to the outcropping.
JAFAR
I must have that lamp if I am to
be Sultan.
IAGO
(kicks the outcropping} And that sturnblebum Gazeern has
to_go and get himself turned into
cat food!
He picks up the scarab pieces, flaps back to Jafar, drops the
pieces into Jafar's hand.

0 JAFAR
A setback, Iago ... not a defeat.
Gazeem was not ... 'wise enough.'
I.AGO
Big surprise there.
(scratches his head)
What else did that yakkin' pile
of sand say? 'Only one may enter
here?'
JAFAR
(musing)
Yes ... I must find this one. This
'diamond in the rough ... '
EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY
6.
ALADDIN, wiry, shaggy hair, ragged clothes, runs for his life,
clutching a loaf of bread. He skids to a stop at the edge of
the building. Quite a drop.
GUARD
Stop, thief!
Alada.:i.n looks back--GUARDS scramble toward him. Aladdin puts
the lo<-1.f of bread between his teeth, and LEAPS off the roof--
--trampclines off an awning--
--backflips toward a clothesline--
--lands on it, struggles to keep his balance--
--then falls, landing hard in a ceramic pot.
Guards on the roof wave their swords.
GUARD
You won't get away that easy!
ALADDIN
(beleaguered; half to
himself)
You think that was ~?
Aladdin struggles to get out of the pot--suddenly the Head
Guard, RAZOUL, looms over him, huge scimitar drawn--
RAZOUL
I'll teach you to steal from
honest men!
ALADDIN
(low, a declaration of
principle)
I·steal to eat.
The blade slashes down--Aladdin kicks a window shutter in its
path-- the blade gets jammed in the shutter--
0
7.
Aladdin rocks the pot, tipping it over. It breaks; Aladdin
scrambles free, runs down a side street--
--where guards suddenly appear. Aladdin looks back--more guards
rush toward him. He is surrounded.
ALADDIN
Abu!
(eying the approaching
guards)
Abu ... hurry it up ....
Suddenly ABU, Aladdin's pet monkey, drops down, grabs Aladdin.
He pulls Aladdin up--out of the path of the onrushing guards--
As they rise, we see that Abu has tied himself to a rope; they
pass the counterweight (a big sack of flour) as it drops--
--nailing the guards in a powdery explosion.
Aladdin and Abu land on the roof; Abu unties himself.
ALADDIN
Perfect timing, Abu!
Abu chatters 'no sweat!' But a guard appears on the roof--
ALADDIN
(to Abu)
I'll go high, you go low ...
Abu slips between the guard's legs as Aladdin leaps over.
Aladdin grabs the cloth of the turban and jumps, the unravelling
turban slowing his fall as the guard is spun around--
Aladdin lands on a herd of sheep~ Looks back. Guards wade after
them, tossing sheep aside.
ALADDIN
(shakes his head)
How much do they~ these guys .. ?
Aladdin leap~ over a £akir on a bed of nails--
The guards run the fakir over--
As Aladdin dashes past a sword swallower, he pulls
out of the swallower's craw--
ALADDIN
'scuse me--
the sword
He slashes a rope--a crate falls, pinning two guards--
Aladdin stabs the sword into a wall, pulls it back, lets it go--
THWAANG! it nails another guard--
Razoul tackles him hard, yanks him up by the wrist--
RAZOUL
I'll have your hand for a trophy,
street rat!
0
f
ALADDIN
The name is Aladdin.
8.
Pulling against Razoul's grip, he runs up Razoul's chest,
backflips to an awning.
ALADDIN
Show some respect!
Abu runs across the handles of knives on display, flipping them
into the air--they narrowly miss the guards--
Aladdin runs along the awning--Razoul appears on the roof beside
him. One of the guards below slashes the awning--the tear races
toward Aladdin--
Aladdin falls through the awning, beneath Razoul's slash--
--onto carpet rolls. He runs across them--
Razoul leaps down to follow----gets his feet stuck in two
rolls, like stilts--
Aladdin leaps from the rolls onto a plank, catapulting a snake
charmer's basket onto Razoul--Razoul teeters--
--then falls into a camel wash--water roars through the square.
Aladdin and Abu watch from their high, safe vantage point.
Abu chatters, 'I am~-'
ALADDIN
(rueful) All that for a loaf of bread ...
He strains--the bread breaks with a snap. Aladdin makes a face.
ALADDIN ... stale bread ...
He tosses half to Abu. Abu gnaws on it. A scent catches his
attention; he sniffs, following it. Looks down, into a window,
at:
A family, sitting down to a large dinner. Aladdin also looks
in.
ALADDIN
Yeah, Abu ... that'd be the life ...
He is looking at the people, chatting, laughing. Abu is looking·
at the food. Someone inside closes the shutters.
ALADDIN
Ah, forget it. This--
(gestures to include
their surroundings)
--is the hand we were dealt. It'd
take a miracle to change it ...
0
9.
Abu looks very sad. Aladdin realizes he is the cause. He tries
to bolster Abu's spirit.
ALADDIN
But, hey, we're the greatest
thieves in all of Agrabah! If we
don't like the cards we've got--
we steal a new deck.
(Abu cheers up some)
We were meant for bigger things
than scrambling for crusts of
bread and sleeping in alleys ...
Abu chatters 'go on ... like what?'
ALADDIN
Well ... how about when we walk
through the marketplace, people
say 'How may I help you,&.
Aladdin, Mr. Abu?' And then we
go home--to a house. With feather
beds ... and all the bananas you
can eat.
Abu likes that. He glares at his half of the bread. Moves to
throw it away--Aladdin stops him.
ALADDIN
But until then ... we got to
survive, right?
Abu shrugs, nods. Aladdin holds his half up. Abu taps his half
against it, like clinking glasses.
ALADDIN
Count on me, Abu ... Things are
going to change.
(sings)
HOLD ON
THERE'S A RAINBOW
THERE'S A SUNRISE
THERE'S A DAWN
HOLD ON
I HEAR THE CALLING OF FATE
THERE'S SOMETHING GREAT AND IT'S WAITING FOR YOU
HANG ON
TILL TOMORROW
A NEW DAY IS DUE
DID SOMEBODY ORDER MIRACLES FOR TWO?
COUNT ON ME--I'LL COME THROUGH
...
As he sings, he and Abu go about finding a place to sleep. It
is cold and lonely, and the best they can manage is a make-shift
lean-to.
0 AND WE'LL HAVE ADVENTURES
IN MAGICAL PLACES
A PRIVATE OASIS OUT THERE IN THE SANDS
DIAMONDS AND RUBIES AND EMERALDS AND PEARLS
A PALACE AND SERVANTS AND BEAUTIFUL GIRLS

DESTINY CALLS AND ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE

DESTINY CALLS AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS COUNT ON ME--I'LL COME THROUGH
They crawl into their lean-to. PULL BACK to show their plight:
two little guys in a huge, dark city.
INT. PALACE - THRONE ROOM - MORNING
CLOSE ON: A mechanized miniature of the palace, the cloc·kwork
sun rising behind it.
The SULTAN, a roly-poly fellow, watches as: on a tiny balc·ony,
a prince and a princess motor toward each other, kiss.
SULTAN
Oh, I just lm.m:i this suitor is
the one Jasmine will fall in love
with--
A resounding SLAM breaks the moment.
PRINCE ACHMED, in ridiculously ornate garb, stalks down the
hall, furious, insulted. Part of his cloak is ripped.
ACHMED
I've never been so insulted. Good
luck marrying her off!
SULTAN
Prince Achmed--you're not leaving
so ... soon, are you .. ?
But Achmed is out the door, another SLAM in his wake.
The Sultan sighs, hurries out the way Achmed came in.
EXT. PALACE - GARDENS/MENAGERIE
The Sultan comes down the steps--
SULTAN
Jasmine!
--and is suddenly face-to-face with RAJA, a huge, menacing, growling tiger, fur bristling protectively. Part of Prince
Achmed's cloak still in his mouth.
. ( .t..i .. ~J
SULTAN
Confound it, Raja--
(grabs the cloak)
So .th.Ls. is why Prince Achmed
stormed out!
Raja quickly drops his head and slinks back to--
PRINCESS JASMINE. She avoids the Sultan's eyes.
JASMINE
Actually, it was because I told
him ... I could never marry a man
who dresses better than I do.
Raja snickers at this.
SULTAN
Dearest ... you've got to stop
rejecting every suitor who comes
to call. The Law says you--
SULTAN/JASMINE
--must marry a prince by your
sixteenth birthday.
JASMINE
Believe me, Papa--I know ...
SULTAN
You've only got three more days!
11.
She moves to one of the bird cages, takes out a bird, strokes
it.
JASMINE
Papa ... I hate being forced into
this. When I do marry, I want it
to be for love.
SULTAN
Jasmine ... it's not only this
law ... I'm not going to be around
forever, and ... well ... I just want
to make sure you're taken care
of ... provided for.
During this, he has taken the bird from her hands and locked
it back in its cage.
JASMINE
But--I want more than that. I've
never done anything on my own.
I've never had any real friends--
(Raja growls in protest}
--except you, Raja. I've never
even been outside the palace
walls!
12.
She looks at a reflection of herself in a pool of water.
SULTAN
But Jasmine--you're a princess--
JASMINE
Then maybe· I don't want to be a
princess anymore!
She splashes the water, destroying the reflection, stands,
turning her back to the Sultan, who throws up his hand~.
SULTAN
(to Raja)
Allah forbid you are ever blessed
with a daughter!
He hurries off.
Jasmine turns enough to watch him go. She is sad--but then her
expression changes to defiant resolve. She moves away--
And opens all the bird cages as she goes past.
Jasmine smiles, bittersweet, watching as the birds take wing.
INT. PALACE - THRONE ROOM - MORNING
The Sultan walks in, head down, depressed.
SULTAN
I don't know where .she gets it
from ... her mother wasn't nearly
so picky.
He looks at the table-top clockwork miniature of Agrabah, where
the prince and princess again kiss.
SULTAN
If only the real world would run
as perfectly ...
A SHADOW falls on the model palace, extending across the map.,
SULTAN (CONT'D)
Ah, Jafar .... I am in desperate
need of your wisdom.
We see the shadow is cast by--
Jafar, the dark man with dark purpose.
In the Sultan's presence, Jafar is self-effacing--but we can
tell he hates this role.
JAFAR
My life is but to serve you, my
lo·rd.
SULTAN
It's this suitor business! Jasmine
refuses to choose a husband. I
am at my wits' end!

Ile vi~Lually ~tufr~ a cracker into the reluctant Iagots mouth.
Iago chews it sullenly, crumbs dribbling from his beak.
JAtAR
You ccrLainly have a way with dumb
animals, sire.
(back to the point}
I uelieve l can divine a solution
to your proble~ ...
SULTAN
If anyone can help, it's you ... my motJt trusted .advisor.
JAFAR
I lilll need the last Dragon's Bye . Ruby ...
The Sultan lifts his beard, revealing a necklace. Settings for
a dozen stones--but only one is left.
SULTAN
BuL ... oh •.• there's only one
left ..• I don*t know if I could
part: with it ...
Jafar uses his snake's head staff to hypnotize the Sultan .
.JAFAR
It is necessary to !ind the
~rincess a suitor. oon't

The Sultan's eyes reflect the glow of the Snake eyes.

JAFAR
You are most gracious, my liege.
Now you can go play with your
little toys, hmn?
SULTAN
Yes, that will be ... pretty good!
14.
He moves to his collection. Jafar spins, hurries on to his own
task.
IAGO
(spits out cracker
crumbs)
(imitates the Sultan)
'Have a cracker, pretty parrot.'
Ptui! I can't take it anymore! If
I gotta choke down one more slice
of stale zweibeck--
(mimes punching the
Sultan)
WHAM! I'm sick of stooging up to
that feeb!
Jafar steps through a secret passage, begins climbing a winding
staircase.
JAFAR
As am I, Iago.
Jafar holds the ruby up for examination, peers one-eyed through
it. It magnifies his eye.
JAFAR (CONT'D)
But this will reveal to.me the
one who can enter the cave--and
bring me the lamp.
At the top of the stairs, Jafar opens a door. Beyond is his lqp,
an alchemist's playground: Beakers bubble, fires crackle.
JAFAR
We will be rid of both the Sultan
arui his daughter, soon enough.
He steps inside.
IAGO
(as though reading it
up in lights)
Hizzoner, Sultan Jafar ... Ooh.
Doesn't that just roll trippingly
off the tongue?
He chuckles 'heh, heh, heh, heh.' The door swings shut.

EXT. PALACE - GARDEN/MENAGERIE - D~Y
Jasmine, in an old cloak, slips furtjvcly to the palace wall.
Sta.1:L:;; Lu clamber up a tL"ee--
SomeLhing tugs on her cloak, pulling her back. It is Raja.
,JASMlNE
I'm sorry, Raja, but I am not
going to stay he.i::·e and have .my
life auctioned o(f.
(tears in her eyes)
1 1 11 miss you.
(she hugs him)
She mov~s Rajah to the wall. Climbs up onto his back, his head,
to a tree, to Lhe the top of the wall.
JASMINt
Gc,r:,d-bye •••
She disappears over the side.
Raja sadly pa~~e, then lies down, head on paws.
INT. PALACE - TOWER - J.AFAR'S SECRET LAB - DA~
Ja£ar conjures at a cauldron. Vapor rises from the potion, forms
-a cloud in the spberical steel-skeleton frame above him.
JAFAR
F.astcr, Iago!
Iago is harnessed to a wheel, running as hard as he can,
generating energy, which feeds into the cloud.
IAGO
(pi.:111Ljn9)
Don'L see why we can't ... just wail
for a .t:.e.a.l. storm ...
The cloud is ,big, black, menacing. Small bolts of lightning ,
scrabble across it.
JAFAR
Save your breath, Iago.
The ruby is set in a frame above a large hourglass. Jafar
gestures, invoking a spel_l.
JMJ\R
Sand~ of 1..ime, I command thee--
Pd.rt aud reveal Lhe one who can
enter the ·cave!
He turns the hour glass over.
A LIGH'l'NING BOLT fires from t:.he cloud. Strikes the Ruby.
The R.uby .flashes, disintegrates; a RUBY GLOW infuses the S;;i.nd.

1 6.
Iago is startled by the lightning flash--he looses his footing,
is whipped up into the mechanism, shocked and spit out.
The sand runs through the glass. A contained sandstorm starts
in the glass' lower half. A picture begins to form.
IAGO
(smoke drifts from his
beak)
The picture's always so grainy ...
JAFAR
Yes ... yes!
The picture clears: it is ALADDIN, in the marketplace. Jafar
leans close.
JAFAR
So ... this ragged urchin is my
'diamond in the rough. 1
IAGO
I figured he'd be taller ...
JAFAR
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall
we?
IAGO
Swell--I love a party.
MOVE IN on Aladdin in the hourglass.'--
EXT. MARKETPLACE - AFTERNOON
DISSOLVE TO:
Aladdin is atop a canopy which covers a fruit stand. Abu reac~es
down to steal a melon from a FRUIT SELLER--
FRUIT SELLER
Get your paws off that, you cursed
filthy ape!
Abu chatters, 'kay.' Drops the melon. He was really cover for
Aladdin, who swipes a melon from the other. side.
In another part of the marketplace, Jasmine appears. She moves
through, dazzled by sights brand new to her.
SELLER
Buy a pot, in brass or silver! I
lose money at twice the price!
-o SELLER #2
Sugared dates! Sugared dates and
figs! Or pistachios! Your taste buds
will dance and sing!
SELLER #3
A pretty necklace for a pretty--
SELLER f4
FISH! FRESH FISH!
17.
He shoves a fish in her face, causing her to back away--into
a FIRE EATER, who spews a stream of flame. Jasmine starts, her
hood falling back from her head. Surprise turns to delight.
Aladdin spots her. Gasps. She is beautiful.
Abu can't get Aladdin's attention. He clambers up onto his
head, spot the distraction. Rolls his eyes.
Jasmine straightens her hood, continues her exploration.
A kid staring hungrily at apples in a VENDOR'S cart.
Jasmine hands him apple. The kid clutches it, runs off.
VENDOR
You'd better be able to pay for
that!
Jasmine starts, turns: a huge angry VENDOR is right in her .face.
JASMINE
Pay .. ?
The Vendor can barely contain his a~ger; he grabs her hard.
VENDOR
N.Q ~ steals from my cart!
JASMINE
Please ... If you let me go to the
palace ... I can get money from the
Sultan--
The Vendor grabs Jasmine's arm.
VENDOR
Thief! Do you know what the penalty
is for stealing?
He raises his knife menacingly--but Aladdin grabs his hand.
ALADDIN
Thank you, kind sir, I'm so
pleased you found her.
(to Jasmine)
I've been looking all over for
you!
Jasmine is confused by this. The Vendor pushes Aladdin away.
0
VENDOR
You know this girl?
ALADDIN
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.
(he twirls his finger
beside his head)
She's a little crazy.
18.
Jasmine doesn't like the accusation. The Vendor smells a rat.
He draws Aladdin close, fingering his knife.
VENDOR
She said she knew the Sultan.
Aladdin gestures toward Abu.
ALADDIN
(confiding) She thinks the monk~y is the
Sultan.
The Vendor considers this, but doesn't buy it. He makes a fist,
draws back, ready to pound Aladdin--
JASMINE
O, wise Sultan. How may I serve
you?
The Vendor looks: Jasmine is bowing to Abu, forehead to ground. Aladdin uses the distraction to swipe an apple.
Abu assumes a pompous, lordly air, .pats Jasmine on the head.
People laugh;. Aladdin offers the .apple to the Vendor.
ALADDIN
See? No harm done.
(soothing)
Come along, sister. Time to go
to see the doctor.
Jasmine follows obediently, pauses in front of a camel.
JASMINE
(to the qamel) Hello, doctor. How are you?
ALADDIN
Not that one. Come on ... (to Abu)
C'mon, Sultan.
Abu gives the crowd a lordly 'carry on' gesture--and drops several apples from behind his back.
VENDOR
Wha--?

-o Aladdin and Jasmine break into a run.
VENDOR
Come back here, you little
thieves!
Abu grabs up the apples, races after them.
EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET
19.
Jasmine climbs over a wall, not particularly gracefully.
ALADDIN (0. S.)
So ... this is your first time in
the marketplace, huh?
JASMINE
Is it that obvious?
Aladdin picks up a pole from an old, torn canopy.
ALADDIN
Well, you do kind of stand out ...
Abu hanging onto him, he vaults over to the next rooftop.
As he speaks, Aladdin picks up an old plank, lays it across to
the other roof.
ALADDIN
I mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be--
Just as he finishes making the bridge, he is startled by--
Jasmine, following his lead, vaulting across.
JASMINE
I'm a fast learner.
She tosses the pole to him, strolls off.
Aladdin looks at Abu--they're both a little-amazed. Aladdin
smiles, tosses the pole to Abu as he hurries after Jasmine.
ALADDIN
(taking the lead)
C'mon ... This way.
He leads her through an ·archway.
They are overlooking Agrabah. The palace dominant, beneath a
gorgeous sunset. Breathtaking.
ALADDIN
Doesn't the palace look great from
here?
He gazes out as she moves up beside him. She is downcast,
remembering why she's out here in the first place.
JASMINE
Oh, yes ... it's great.
Jasmine turns away from the view. Sits down.
ALADDIN
So where are you from?
JASMINE
It doesn't matter ... I ran away,
and I'm not going back.
ALADDIN
Really? How come?
JASMINE
My father is forcing me to get
married.
ALADDIN
Oh. That's, uh ... that's awful.
(genuine)
I wish I could help ...
20.
His sincerity affects her. She turns to look at him. He looks
back at her ... smiles tenderly. She returns it.
RAZOUL {O. S.}
Here you are!
Jafar's Guards--led by Razoul--cross towards them.
JASMINE/ALADDIN
They' re after me! ·
(beat)
They're after~?
JASMINE
Well, you see, my father--
ALADDIN
(cuts her off)
Do you trust me?
JASMINE
(not quite sure) ... yes ...
ALADDIN
Then--~!
They leap off the terrace, bounce off a stable canopy, into a
pile of hay. They scramble into the stables proper.
A guard slides off the canopy, thuds on the ground. He moves
into the stable.
()
21.
Aladdin, wedged between two ceiling beams motions 'get down'
to Jasmine, who ducks her head, hidden in a pile of hay--the
furthest one from the door.
The Guard fills the doorway, scans the interior.
Abu ducks back into a disgruntled horse's feedbag.
The Guard smiles at the hay piles. He jabs his sword into one--
Aladdin watches--the guard is approaching Jasmine--
Inside the hay pile, Jasmine can hear the guard nearing--
The Guard is just about to jab Jasmine's hay pile--
ALADDIN
Hey! You looking for me?
The guard whirls. Aladdin drops from his hiding place.
The guard attacks--Aladdin dodges, ducks--Jasmine peeks out, is
impressed this boy is putting it on the line for her--
Aladdin is backed into a corner.
The Guard attacks. Aladdin grabs the Abu-filled feedbag, stuffs
it over the Guard's head. Screeches and yelps from inside the
bag.
Aladdin bumps into something--Razoul. The rest of the guards
are behind him.
RAZOUL
We just keep running into each
other, don't we, street rat?
The Guard pulls the bag off ... pulls Abu off his face, hurls Abu
aside, into an old earthenware jug.
RAZOUL
It's the dungeon for you, :boy.
Jasmine leaps out, grabs Razoul by the arm.
JASMINE
Let him go! Let go!
RAZOUL
Looky here, men--a street mouse!
He shrugs her aside, sending her sprawling. The Guards laugh.
Jasmine stands up, fire in her eyes. Regally draws back the
hood of her cloak.
JASMINE
Release him--By order of the
Princess!
The guards draw back, shocked, even Razoul. They bow to her.
ALADDIN
(stunned) ... the Princess ... ?
0
RAZOUL
Princess Jasmine ... what are you
doing outside the palace?
JASMINE
That's my affair. Do as I
command ... release him.
RAZOUL
Alas, Princess, I fear I cannot.
my orders come from Jafar. You'll
have to take it up with him.
22.
They haul Aladdin off. Jasmine watches, scowling, determined.
JASMINE
(to herself) Believe me ... I will ...
NERVOUS GUARD
Ahem.
(Jasmine looks at him)
May I escort you back to the
palace, Princess?
Jasmine considers ... then decides. She turns, throwing her hood
back over her shoulder, whapping the guard in the face. She
stalks off, toward the palace, the guard following.
A beat. Abu screeches from inside the earthenware jug. It
topples over, shattering. Abu shakes his head, looks around.
In the distance, he sees Aladdin b~ing dragged to the palace.
INT. PALACE - JAFAR'S CHAMBER
Jafar.slips into his quarters from a secret passage-- and Jasmine storms into the chamber, looking for him.
JASMINE
Jafar!
Jafar closes the passage door quickly ... painfully pining Iago between the door and the jamb. Iago squawks.
JAFAR
Princess!
He spreads his robes, hiding Iago from Jasmine's view.
JAFAR
How may I be of service to you?
Jasmine moves in on him, angry.
JASMINE
The guards just took a boy from
the market--on your orders.
C) JAFAR
(feigns puzzlement)
Your father has. charged me with
keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy
was a criminal.
JASMINE
(sharp)
What was his crime?
23.
Unseen by Jasmine, Iago tries to wriggle out of the doorway.
He tugs at Jafar's robe hem. Mimes begging.
JAFAR
Why, kidnapping the Princess, of
course.
Jafar covertly kicks Iago back into the passage.
JASMINE
(appalled)
He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!
JAFAR
Oh ... dear. How frightfully upsetting. Had I but known ...
Jasmine waits, distraught, as Jafar milks the moment.
JAFAR
Sadly, the boy's sentence has
already been carried out ...
JASMINE
What do you mean .. ?
JAFAR
Death ... by beheading.
Jasmine draws back in horror. She is stunned.
JASMINE
(a whisper)
How ... could you--
JAFAR
(reaches out to comfort
her)
I .am exceedingly sorry,
Princess ...
She spins away from his touch, runs from the room.
A beat. Jafar smiles, shrugs, a 1 c 1 est la vie' gesture. Iago pushes the secret door back open.
IAGO
How'd it go?
JAFAR
I think she took that rather well.
EXT. PALACE - GARDENS/MENAGERIE - EVENING
Raja is looking, concerned and empathetic--
24.
--at Jasmine, who is sobbing. Raja moves to her side, nosenudges her questioningly. She looks up, teary-eyed, then hugs
him, burying her face in his ruff.
JASMINE ... I didn't even know his name ...
PAN UP the wall; Abu sticks his head up. Leaps to a palm, then
to the ground, rustling a bush.
Raja hears it, startled.
Abu moves through the shrubs. A low GROWL makes him pull up
short. He turns slowly--
Raja is right there, huge teeth glinting.
Abu is terrified. He runs.
Raja searches for Abu. He moves past a statue, the classic 'SEE
NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL.' Abu has taken a fourth
position: 'SMELL NO EVIL.'
Raja pauses. Sniffs suspiciously, coming closer to Abu--
JASMINE (0. S.)
Raja?
Raja turns in the direction of her voice ... throws a last
suspicious glance at the statue ... then hurries off.
Abu lets out his breath, relieved. -'Scampers away.
INT. PALACE - DUNGEON/TORTURE CHAMBER - NIGHT
Rats scurry across the gloomy walls, in and out of shafts of
moonlight shining through a high, barred window.
Aladdin hangs slumped in defeat, supported only by the wrist , manacles that chain him to the wall of the dark chamber.
Abu's shadow appears on the wall; Aladdin looks up.
ALADDIN
Abu! Down here!
Abu chitters, scampers down. Aladdin pulls on the arm irons.
ALADDIN
Help me out of these ...
Abu chatters, scolding Aladdin. He does a burlesque imitation
of a woman--then makes a disgusted, dismissive gesture.
ALADDIN
What could I do? She was in
trouble.
Abu begins to work on Aladdin's wrist cuffs.
ALADDIN (CONT'D)
She was the Princess. I can't
believe it.
(slumps) She was terrific. For a while
there, I was thinking that maybe
she and I ...
Abu chatters, warning him to forget her.
ALADDIN
(bitter)
Don't worry, Abu ... there's a .l.a,li.
She has to marry a Prince.
(beat)
She deserves a Prince.
25.
Abu springs the lock. Grins, pleased. Aladdin does not share
his elation; he looks around the dungeon.
ALADDIN
I'm a fool.
VOICE (O.S.)
You're only a fool if you give
up, boy.
Aladdin starts, turns--
From out of the darkest corner of the dungeon a figure limps forward into the light: Jafar, disguised as a lame prisoner.
ALADDIN
(wary)
Who are you?
JAFAR
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.
But together--perhaps we can be
more ...
ALADDIN
(suspicious)
I'm listening ...
JAFAR
There is a cave, boy ... a cave of
wonders ... filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams ...
Abu lights up at this.
JAFAR (CONT'D) (sly)
Treasure enough to impress even
your princess, I'd wager ...
The thought is appealing to Aladdin--but there's a problem--
0 ALADDIN
But the law says--
JAFAR
You've heard of the Golden Rule,
haven't you? 'Whoever has the
gold ... makes the rules.•
ALADDIN
So why would you share all this
wonderful treasure with me?
JAFAR
(indicates his own leg)
I need a young pair of legs and
a strong back to go in after it.
Aladdin considers.
ALADDIN
It's fine to talk about ... but
I don't see how you're planning
to get us out of here.
26.
Jafar moves to a wall of the chamber. Iago peeks out from the
hump on Jafar's back.
IAGO
(sotto)
Ya got 'em hooked ... now reeeel
him in!
JAFAR
(stuffs 1ago away) . Don't be so hasty, boy. ·Things
aren't always what they seem.
Jafar pushes in a particular stone. A section of the wall moves
aside, revealing a staircase. ,
JAFAR
I can get what I want ... and you
can win the Princess. Do we have
a deal?
(extends his hand)
Aladdin hesitates ... looks at Abu. Abu is dubious. Aladdin looks
back at Jafar ... And then Aladdin shakes Jafar's hand.
Jafar CACKLES and pulls him through the door. Abu hurries
through before the door shuts.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
Riding camels, Jafar and Aladdin trek across .the desert. Aladdin

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. DESERT - CAVE OF WONDERS LOCATION - NIGHT
Jafar and Aladdin are at the outcropping. The Tiger's head RISES
FROM THE SAND.
Aladdin stares in awe. Abu peaks out of his hiding place in
Aladdin's vest.
TIGER-GOD
WHO DISTURBS MY SLUMBER?
ALADDIN
Uh, it's me ... Aladdin.
BLINDING LIGHT from the cave. Aladdin winces.
TIGER-GOD
KNOW THIS! ONLY .QNE MAY ENTER HERE
WHOM I DEEM WISE ENOUGH.
ONE WHOSE WORTH LIES DEEP WITHIN;
THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.
Aladdin looks back at Jafar questioningly.
JAFAR
(urging him forward)
Remember, boy--bring me the ..J..fil!m.
And the treasure is yours!
Aladdin nods, steps toward the cave, Abu hanging on tight.
INT. CAVE OF WONDERS - FIRST CHAMBER
Aladdin and Abu descend warily. The stairs end in a beautiful
chamber carved out of the stone. Tiled floor, finished walls.
On the walls are full-sized pictographs of human figures. The~
are all reaching for something ... -~ .and they all have a frozen rictus of abject terror.
Aladdin barely notices--because at the far end of the chamber
is a marble pedestal--and on the pedestal is a LAMP.
It is gorgeous: large, bejeweled, its gold surface polished to
a high sheen.
ALADDIN
(an intake of breath)
Oh ...
Aladdin nears the pedestal. He moves to take the lamp--
--and catches sight of his reflection in the lamp: A DISTORTED
FIGURE, REACHING OUT. Above it, on the wall is the Thief; he
has become a pictograph on the wall, the latest in the long
line.
28.
/;
\'•. ,,, Realization dawns. Aladdin draws his hand back.
~
Abu chatters--what's the hang-up? He reaches for the lamp--
Aladdin catches his wrists.
ALADDIN
No, Abu. I don't think that's the
right one.
Suddenly, the lights go out.
A RUMBLE--and a slit of golden light appears, forms into an
arched doorway. Aladdin smiles. He steps through.
INT. TREASURE CHAMBER
A huge cavern filled floor-to-ceiling with all manner of fortune
and treasure. Gold and emerald-encrusted pillars have been
carved out of the very stone.
Aladdin surveys the riches in wonder.
Abu races to a large treasure chest--
ALADDIN
Abu! Don't touch anything.
--Abu pulls up short. But it looks so inviting ...
ALADDIN
(certain)
We have to find the lamp first.
The ..t:.ea..l one.
Aladdin goes past. Abu gives the chest a final longing look,
then follows Aladdin.
Suddenly the richly-woven (but very dusty} golden-tasseled
CARPET Abu has walked across COMES TO LIFE. It rises, follows
them, floating above the ground. ·
Abu senses something, turns. The Carpet quickly lies flat.•
Abu turns away. The Carpet follows. Abu spins back--but the
Carpet has already become motionless. Abu scratches his head,
tugs at Aladdin's shirt, trying to get his attention.
ALADDIN
Shhhh!
The Carpet has become more bold. It taps Abu on the shoulder,
then ducks away. The peekaboo game continues until finally Abu
and the Carpet come face-to-face. Abu screams, jumps back, all
over Aladdin. The Carpet--equally terrified--zips away, hides
behind a stalagmite.
ALADDIN
Abu--what--are you crazy?
Abu points frantically--Aladdin sees the carpet.
ALADDIN
(incredulous)
A ... magic carpet!
0
29.
The Carpet approaches Aladdin cautiously. Aladdin strokes it.
ALADDIN
I'm not gonna hurt you ...
The Carpet zips around happily, sending up puffs of dust.
ALADDIN
You've been in here a long time,
huh?
(The Carpet nods)
You're pretty dusty ... (the Carpet acts
embarrassed)
Here, let me ...
He grabs two of its corners, and shakes the dust off. The Carpet reels, a little disoriented--but then takes a look at itself.,
Dust-free, it's a very pretty carpet. It preens.
ALADDIN
I guess your owner must've come
looking for the lamp, huh?
(The Carpet nods) That's why we 1 re here, too ... (The Carpet points
excitedly) I think it knows where it is!
The Carpet zips off. Aladdin and Abu chase after it.
INT. LAMP CAVERN - NIGHT
The passageway opens into an immense cavern.
At the end of the cavern is a huge monolith, steps cut into
face, surrounded by a pool. Stepping stones lead across.
Atop it, in a beam of light, is the LAMP.
ALADDIN
You two wait here ...
Aladdin hopscotches the rocks across the pool; Abu and the
Carpet watch. Abu becomes aware of something, turns--
its
Not too far away sits a stone monkey idol. The monkey idol
invitingly holds out a beautiful jewel. Abu reacts--'for me? 1
Aladdin ascends the staircase toward the lamp.
Below, Abu has become transfixed by the monkey idol. Reaches
for the jewel. The Carpet grabs Abu, holds him back.
At the top of the staircase, Aladdin looks through the light
to see: a dented. dust-covered. dull metal lamp. Aladdin nods 'this is it.' Reaches for it ... picks it up.
ANGLE ON: Abu, as he breaks free of the Carpet. Takes the jewel from the Monkey Idol.
ALADDIN
(to himself}
Now, why would that old man want
this old thing .. ?
(spots Abu)
Abu! NQ! !
30.
But it's too late. There is a faint RUMBLING sound in the
distance. Dust falls from above. The ground begins to QUIVER.
TIGER-GOD (0. S.)
INFIDELS! YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE
FORBIDDEN TREASURE! YOU ARE DOOMED!
Abu quickly puts the jewel back--to no avail--
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE
The cavern SHAKES violently. The monolith stairway transforms
into a chute--Aladdin clutches the lamp as he slides down the
chute toward the pool--now transformed to boiling lava.
Just in time, the Carpet zooms in, catches him. They streak to
grab up Abu, who is about to be crushed beneath falling·stone.
INT. TREASURE CHAMBER
The piles of treasure TRANSFORM into mountains of fire, the
flames reaching up, scorching the carpet as they fly through.
INT. FIRST CHAMBER
The pictograph figures peel off the walls, wafer-thin creatures
clutching after Aladdin, Abu and the Carpet. The three
desperately avoid them as they make their way up the
disintegrating stairway--
EXT. CAVE OF WONDERS
Outside, the earth TREMBLES. Winds SWIRL ferociously. Lightning
FLASHES, thunder BOOMS. The Tiger's head ROARS as if in agony'-
Jafar watches, intently; Iago frightfully peers out from his
cloak.
INT. CAVE OF WONDERS - STAIRWAY
a gig.antic stalactite breaks off and pins the Carpet. Abu and
Aladdin are thrown forward. A chasm opens, cutting them off from
any chance of helping the carpet.
Aladdin and Abu scramble up to the entrance.
Abu makes it out. The ground gives way; Aladdin hangs by his
fingers from the lip. Below him is a tremendously steep drop. Jafar appears above.
ALADDIN
(shouts over the din)
~ me.!

JAFAR
Throw me the lamp!
ALADDIN
I can't hold on! Give me your hand!
JAFAR
First give rn.e. the lamp!
31 .
Aladdin fumbles for the lamp. Holds it out. Jafar snatches it
away.
EXT. CAVE OF WONDERS ·-·
The earth SHAKES even more violently and the WINDS, LIGHTNING,
and THUNDER accelerate. Jafar clutches the lamp with both hands, - eyes gleaming.
JAFAR
(laughing)
YE.S. ! ! At last!
Jafar turns and sees Abu helping Aladdin out from the entrance.
Jafar pockets the lamp in his robe and pulls out a dagger. He
kicks Abu aside and raises the dagger.
ALADDIN
What are you doing?!
JAFAR
Ending your miserable life, you
stupid little urchin!
Abu leaps at Jafar and bites him hard in the arm. Jafar SCREAMS
and drops the dagger. Jafar fights to extricate himself from
the furious monkey. Iago is expelled, squawking, from Jafar's
robes. Jafar viciously hurls Abu down through the entrance at
Aladdin.
EXT. ENTRANCE
Aladdin and Abu drop back into the cave--
INT. THE CAVE
The Carpet finally manages to pull free of the stalactite. It
zips toward the entrance--
...
As Aladdin and Abu hurt.le down the steep drop, they crash into
the Carpet on its way up. This breaks their fall; the three
tumble down to the floor of the cave.
EXT. ENTRANCE
The EARTHQUAKE, and SANDSTORM build to a cataclysmic finale as
the Tiger's head completely disintegrates and the plains of sand
swirl around like a whirlpool.
Jafar reaches into his robe.
\ )
JAFAR
(chuckling)
It's~! It's all mine! With the
power of this lamp I will ...
32.
A horrified look comes over Jafar's face. He tears open the
robe.
JAFAR
Where is it?
(searches desperately)
N.Q!
Jafar scrambles after the scarab pieces in the outcropping as
everything vanishes into the sand.
There is a final FLASH of LIGHTNING and CRACK of THUNDER, then
all is still and quiet. Jafar digs furiously, pulls out Iago,
who sputters sand.
IAGO
Oh, thank you, your benevolence!
I knew you'd save me!
JAFAR
No!
Jafar tosses Iago aside, continues digging. But there, is no
trace of the outcropping, or the scarab pieces.
JAFAR
This can't be! ll can't b.e.!
Iago scratches halfheartedly at the sand. We pull back to an
EXTREME LONG SHOT of the tiny figure of Jafar on his knees, arms
raised in torment.
INT. CAVE OF WONDERS
Aladdin comes to. Abu and the Carpet are on top of him. They ""'
stir groggily. Aladdin groans.
ALADDIN ... my head ...
He looks up at the solid cavern ceiling.
ALADDIN
Trapped ...
(despairing)
At least the dungeon had a
window ...
(slumps back)
That two-faced son of a
jackal ... whoever he is, he's
probably long gone with that
lamp ...
33.
Abu chatters--like a magician, he reveals: The Lamp. Aladdin
is surprised ... then he laughs.
ALADDIN
Abu!
(grins admiringly)
You little thief!
(takes the lamp)
This'll teach that old guy to mess
with us!
Aladdin studies the lamp carefully.
ALADDIN (CONT.)
It's such a beat-up, worthless
piece of junk ... ?
(notices)
I think there's something written
here ... but it's hard to make
out .. .
Aladdin rubs the lamp with his sleeve. It glows slightly--and
then, POOF! Colorful smoke spews out of the spout. It eddies and
swirls, filling the cave, taking shape and solid form--
Towering above Aladdin is the gigantic GENIE of the lamp. He
is a hip, hyper, mercurial Robin Williams type, full,of
exuberance, with a child-like vulnerability.
GENIE
Oy! Ten thousand years will give
you filJ.cil a crick in the neck!
He CRACKS his neck, turning it completely around. Aladdin tries
to speak but is cut off by the Genie.
GENIE
Hang on a second ... Whaaa . .. wow!
Does it feel good to get outta
there! I'm telling you! Nice to be
back ladies and gentlemen. Hi,
where you from, what's your name?
ALADDIN
(extremely wary)
Aladdin. But who are you--
GENIE
Aladdin! Hello, Aladdin, nice to
have you on the show. Can we call
you "Al"'? or maybe just "Din"? or
how 'bout "Laddie." Sounds like
here, boy! (whistles) come on,
Laddie!
ALADDIN
(to the carpet)
I must've hit my head harder than
I thought.
GENIE
Do you smoke? Mind if I do? (Poof!}
HA HA HA HA! Sorry Bonzo! Hope I
didn't singe the fur!
Abu is comically scared; the car~et laughs.
GENIE
(noticed the carpet)
Yo! Rugman! Haven't seen you in a
few rnillenia--Gimme five!
(slaps hand-to-tassel)
(to Aladdin)
You're a lot smaller than my last
master! Either that or I'm getting
bigger! Look at me from the side,
do I look different to you?
ALADDIN
Whoa--wait a minute. I'm--your
master?
GENIE
That's right! He can be taught! What
would you wish of me ... the ever
impressive, the long contained,
the often imitated but never
duplicated, duplicated,
duplicated, duplicated ... 'Genie .o..f
.th.!! .l.a..mJ;2! Right here! .Direct from
the lamp! Right here for your very
much wish fulfillment!
ALADDIN
(getting it clear)
.li.iM-fullfilrnent ...
GENIE
Three wishes to be exact! No
substitutions, exchanges or
refunds!
Aladdin stares, deadpan.
ALADDIN
Now I knQH. I'm dreaming ...
GENIE
Master, I don't think you realize
what you got here. So why don't
you just ruminate whilest I
illuminates the poss-o-bilities!

MISTER ALADDIN SIR -- WHAT WILL YOUR PLEASURE BE?
LET ME TAKE YOUR ORDER -- JOT IT DOWN
YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD A FRIEND LIKE ME
As the Genie demonstrates his magical powers, the dark cave
lights up and becomes his stage. The Genie changes his size,
shape, and costume at will and creates a series of rapid-fire
images, (an elaborate banquet, a bevy of beautiful harem girls,)
that shift around Aladdin, keeping him off balance.
GENIE (CONT.)
LIFE IS YOUR RESTAURANT
AND I IM YOUR MAITRE ID
C'MON WHISPER WHAT IT IS YOU WANT

As the song escalates, the Genie creates more images: Slaves,
armies, camels, horses, treasure, etc, filling the cave.
GENIE (CONT.)
CAN YOUR FRIENDS DO THIS?
CAN YOUR FRIENDS DO THAT?
CAN YOUR FRIENDS PULL THIS
OUT THEIR LITTLE HAT?!

WELL ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS RUB LIKE SO
AND OH --
MISTER ALADDIN SIR . WHAT WILL THOSE ORDERS BE?
I DO MY JOB, YOU BIG NABOB
YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD A FRIEND LIKE ME.!
As the song concludes, all that the Genie has created WHOOSHES
back into the lamp. The cave is empty again, save for Aladdin,
Abu, the Carpet and the Genie.
GENIE
So ... what'll it be, master?
ALADDIN
You're gonna grant me any three
wishes I want. Right?
GENIE
That's it in a pistachio shell . .BlIT-- there are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quo.
ALADDIN
What?
GENIE
Uh, rule number one! I can't kill
anybody! So, don't ask! Rule number
two! I can't make anybody fall in
love with anybody else!
(a big 'MWA!' kiss)
You little punim, you! Rule number
three! I can't bring people back
from the dead. It's not a pretty
picture. I don't like doing it.
Other than that, you got it!
ALADDIN
Provisos? You mean--limitations?
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.
(not impressed)
Can't even bring people back from
the dead ... (to Abu}
I don't know, Abu ... he probably
can't even get us out of this
cave!
Abu plays along with a dismissive gesture.
GENIE
Puh-leeese. Get with the program.
ALADDIN
Uh-huh ... C'mon, Abu. Looks like
we're gonna have to find a way
out.
GENIE
(insulted)
The gauntlet has been thrown--the
gloves are off!
The Genie leaps onto the carpet, grabs Aladdin and Abu.
GENIE
Ladies and gentlemen and small
primates-- Keep your hands and
arms inside the carpet! In case
of emergency, exits are here,
here, here, here, here, here,
here, here, anywhere. WE'RE OUTTA
HERE!
37.
The Genie makes a gesture so huge it spins him around. With a
resounding BOOM a crack appears in the cavern ceiling above;
light pours through. The carpet spirals up and out--
EXT. DESERT - DAWN
--into the early morning sky. The Genie's uproarious laughter
ECHOES as they soar away.
INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY
Jafar's head is bowed in abeyance as the Sultan lectures him.
Jasmine stands .beside the Sultan, arms crossed, cold fire in
her eyes.
SULTAN
Jafar, if it weren't for all your
years of loyal service ... (very harsh)
From now on, you're to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me--
before they are beheaded!
JAFAR
I assure you, your highness--it
won't happen again.
SULTAN
Jasmine ... Jafar ... Now, let's put
this whole messy business behind
us ... please?
JAFAR
My most abject and humblest
apologies, Princess.
Jafar forces a smile. Jasmine is not soothed.
JASMINE
(low, to Jafar)
At least some good will come from
my being forced to marry ... When
I am queen, I will have the power
to get rid of~-
38.
She exits, out to the garden. Th~ Sultan hurries after her.
SULTAN
Jasmine--he apologized. Doesn't
that count for something?
They are both gone. Jafar stands there, teeth gritted, face
reddening, seething. A volcano on the verge of eruption.
JAFAR
If only I had gotten that lamp ...
IAGO
To think we gotta keep kowtowing
to that dink and his dink daughter
for the rest of out lives ...
JAFAR
No, Iago ... just until she finds
a dink husband! Then she will have
us banished!
(hand to throat)
Or beheaded!
Iago also puts his hand to his throat.
POV Iago - The garden. Jasmine speaks defiantly to the Sultan.
Iago gets an idea.
IAGO
Wait a minute, Jafar. What
if ... ~ were the dink husband?
JAFAR ... what?
IAGO
You marry the princess! Then you
become the Sultan!
JAFAR
Hmm ... Marry the shrew ... I become
the Sultan ...
Jafar settles onto the Sultan's throne as he considers it.
JAFAR
The idea has merit ...
EXT.
IAGO
(acting it out,
relishing it)
And then we drop papa-in-law and
the little woman off a cliff.
Aaaaaaaaa-- Ker-SPLAT!
OASIS - DAY
A patch of paradise in the barren desert. A watering hole for
a few animals who are startled by the Carpet as it swoops down.
GENIE
Thank you for choosing the Magic
Carpet for your travel needs.
Don't stand until the rug comes
to a complete stop ...
The Carpet stops; Abu tumbles forward, into the water.
GENIE (CONT'D)
(smug, to Aladdin)
I sure hope I put to rest all that
vicious nay-saying ...
ALADDIN
Oh, yeah. He sure showed us, huh,
Abu?
The Genie smiles--then it hits him. He snaps a look at Aladdin~
GENIE
Waaait a second.
(counts on his fing'ers)
Okay ... you got out of the cave.
Two wishes left.
ALADDIN
Ah ... no ... I never actually wished
to get out of the cave. You did
that on your own.
The Genie begins to protest ... stops. He gives Aladdin a slow
sidelong, admiring smile.
GENIE
Well, you got me, kid ... Boy, do
I feel sheepish!
(turns to sheep)
But I'm warning you, you baaaad
boy-- no more freebies!
Abu snaps his fingers 'darn!' Aladdin hops off the Carpet.
ALADDIN
Fair deal ... (pacing, excited) (the
Carpet paces alongside
him)
So ... three wishes ... I want them
to be gQQd ... hmmm
(to Genie)
What would you wish for?
GENIE
(surprised)
Me? You're asking me for advice?
ALADDIN
It's not against the rules, is
it?
GENIE
No, it's just no one's ever done
it before .... (he muses}
Well, I guess you should wish for
what you want most. For instance,.
in my case ... oh, never mind.
Forget it.
ALADDIN
What? What would you wish for?
GENIE
(sincere)
Freedom.
(rocketing on)
See, the only way I can_ escape
this bargain-bin lamp is for my
master to wish me free. So you
can guess how often that's
happened: the big goose egg--null
set--nada-- we're talkin' zee-ro!
ALADDIN
You're a prisoner of this lamp?
40.
....
The Carpet and Abu both peak inside the lamp--the Carpet lifts
the lid, Abu peers down the spout.
GENIE
It's part and parcel of the whole
Genie gig. Phenomenal cosmic
powers, itty-bitty living space.
ALADDIN
(sympathetic, almost
to himself)
A prisoner. That's really ...
Abu finishes the sentence for him with a brief, grim chatter.
0 GENIE
You said it, furry guy. But--to
be .iJ:.e..e. ... To be my own master! Such
a thing would be greater than all
the magic and all the treasures
in all the world ... (beat)
But what am I talkin' about? Let's
get real, it's not gonna happen!
Genie, wake up and smell the
humus!
41.
Aladdin considers ... then comes to an important decision.
ALADDIN
I'll do it. I'll set you free.
GENIE
(mimicking Aladdin)
I'll do it. I'll set you free.
Right!
(Pinnochio-nose grows)
Whoo-cop!
ALADDIN
Hey! I give you my word.
GENIE
(dubious)
The word of a thief .. ?
ALADDIN
(a point of pride)
My word's the only thinq I've got.
The Genie regards him speculativily.
GENIE
(a glimmer of hope)
You're not just pulling my chain?
ALADDIN
After I make my two wishes, I'll
set you free.
The Genie considers.
GENIE
Fair deal.
He extends his hand. Aladdin takes it. They shake.
GENIE
Alright! Let's make some magic! So
how 'bout it? What is it~ want
most? I showed you mine, you show
me yours.
• , I
\ ;
And suddenly Aladdin knows.
ALADDIN
Well, there's this girl ...
GENIE
Ahh ... I told you, Al--Romance,
eet eez not my baggette.
ALADDIN
Oh, yeah ... right ... But. she's being
forced to marry. I gotta help
her ...
The Genie evaluates him. Turns to Abu.
GENIE
He 1 s really got it bad, huh?
, ')
"1.,_.
Abu rolls his eyes, nods, dismisses the whole concept. The
Carpet slaps him reprimandingly on the back of the head, looks
at Aladdin, hands clasped over its breast ( 1 it's soo romantic).
GENIE
This must be some girl ...
ALADDIN
Oh, man, Genie ... She 1 s smart and
fun and--
GENIE
Pretty?
ALADDIN
--beautiful.
(inarticulate)
She 1 s got this long, black ... hair ... And these eyes ... and her
smile ... it's like ... like ...
GENIE
(picturing it)
ALADDIN
(sighs, coming back to
Earth)
She's the Princess. To even have
a chance, I'd have to be ... (the light dawns)
Hey--can you make me a prince?
GENIE
Is that an official wish? Say the
magic words ...
ALADDIN
Genie, I wish for you to make me
a prince!
43.
The Genie whips out a huge cookbook titled 'ROYAL RECIPES.'
GENIE
Lessee ... Chicken a la King ... Alaskan King Crab ... Caesar Salad--
yum .•• Ah! How to Make a Prince!
{reading)
We're talkin' BIGTIME! We're
talkin' GRAND POOBAH! Stand back!
Gimme some room!
The Genie circles Aladdin like a clothes designer.
GENIE
First, the fez and vest combo is
much too third century and those
patches will have to go ...
ALADDIN
Don't hold back--I don't want
anyone to know who I really am.
The Genie unrolls fabric like a window shade, creatirig elegant
robes for Aladdin.
GENIE
White is all the rage this
season ...
ALADDIN
Maybe a turban .. ?
GENIE
Feh on a turban. You need a
TURBAN!
He inflates Aladdin's fez into a huge jeweled turban.
GENIE (CONT'D)
Mu.ch better •.. Now you gotta have
a mode of transportation ...
(sees Abu)
Yo! Bonzo! Aqui!
Abu tries to slip away--he doesn't ·want any part of this.
GENIE (CONT'D)
And what better way to make your
grand entrance down the streets
of Agrabah than riding your very
own . . . BRAND NEW CAMEL ! !
He SNAPS his fingers. Abu transforms into a shocked camel.
GENIE (CONT'D)
Hmmm ... Not enough ... (snaps; Abu becomes
a magnificent stallion)
Still not enough ... (snapping fingers)
What am I thinking of .. ? It's right
on the tip of my fingers ... Ah ha!
Now we're talking!
44.
As he speaks and snaps, Abu becomes various animals, finally
turns into an elephant.
INT.
GENIE (CONT'D)
And just look at all that trunk
space!
ALADDIN
Abu--you look good. Different ... but good.
GENIE
Okay, he's got the outfit! He's
got the elephant! But we're not
through yet ... !
(laughs maniacally)
Hang on to your turban, kid! We're
gonna make you a s.IAB,!!
THRONE ROOM - DAY
Jafar rushes in, a scroll in hand, . Iago following.
JAFAR
Your Highness--! have found a
solution to the problem with your
daughter!
Jafar snaps out the scroll--it unrolls, draping over the Sultan,
on his throne.
JAFAR (CONT' 0)
Right here ... 'If a princess has
not chosen a husband by her
sixteenth birthday--then .the.
Sultan shall choose .f.Q.t: ~!'
The Sultan extricates himself.
SULTAN
But--Jasmine hated all of those
suitors. How can I choose someone
she hates?
JAFAR
Not to worry, my liege. There is
more ... (more)
JAFAR (Cont'd) (he scrolls further) ... 'if, in the event a suitable
prince cannot be found, a princess
may then be wed to'--hmm.
Interesting.
SULTAN
What? Who?
JAFAR
The Royal Vizier. That would
be ... me.
IAGO
That would be him!
Iago flinches, realizing his slip.
SULTAN
But--I thought--the law says that
only a prince can marry a
princess. I'm quite sure ...
4 5.
He paws through the scroll for verification. Jafar pulls it away
from him, rolling it up quickly.
JAFAR
Desperate times call for desperate
measures, my lord.
(uses staff to hypnotize
Sultan)
And these are desperate times,
aren 't they?
SULTAN ~ .. yes ... desperate times ...
JAFAR
You will order the Princess to
marry me.
SULTAN
I will order the Princess to ... (shakes it off a bit)
--but you' re so ... .Q.ld •••
Jafar is affronted. He closes on the Sultan.
JAFAR
(brutal)
The Princess will marry me!
It is effective--the Sultan gasps, as though physically hit.
SULTAN
The Princess ... will ... marry--
marry ...
4 6.
Suddenly, from outside comes the instrumental vamp of 'Prince
Ali.' ·
The Sultan blinks, shakes his head. He gives Jafar a confused
look, hurries to the balcony.
EXT. AGRABAH - MARKETPLACE - DAY
The crowd buzzes; heads turn as musicians round a corner.
MUSICIANS
MAKE WAY FOR PRINCE ALI!
SAY HEY, IT'S PRINCE ALI!
Throughout the song, the Genie infiltrates the crowd in various
guises (an old man, a kid, a harem girl, etc.).
GENIE
HEY! CLEAR THE WAY IN THE OL' BAZAAR
HEY YOU! LET US THROUGH! IT'S A BRIGHT NEW STAR!
OH COME! BE THE FIRST ON YOUR BLOCK
TO MEET HIS EYE!
MAKE WAY, HERE HE COMES, RING BELLS, BANG THE DRUMS!
A.ttE YOU GONNA LOVE THIS GUY!
PRINCE ALI appears, dressed in elegant robes and turban, riding
on a howdah atop the elephantine Abu. Ali is surrounded by an ~ entourage of DANCERS, SWORDSMEN, and ATTENDANTS~ '

People swarm Ali; children run, dragging their parents.
Merchants stop selling; harem girls swoon.

The entourage sweeps through the Palace gates.

Aladdin on Abu and the crowd surge toward the Throne Room.

THRONE ROOM - DAY
Huge doors burst open as Aladdin and his entourage enter the
gigantic Throne Room. The Sultan watches with delight.
GENIE, BAND, CROWD
IT'S ALI! AMOROUS HE! ALI ABABWA!
HEARD YOUR PRINCESS WAS A SIGHT LOVELY TO SEE!
AND THAT, GOOD PEOPLE, IS WHY
HE GOT DOLLED UP AND DROPPED BY
WITH SIXTY ELEPHANTS, LLAMAS GALORE,
WITH HIS BEARS AND LIONS, A BRASS BAND AND MORE
WITH HIS FORTY FAKIRS,
HIS COOKS, HIS BAKERS,
HIS BIRDS THAT WARBLE ON KEY . MAKE WAY FOR PRINCE ALI !
The Genie, his work done, surreptitiously zips back into the
lamp, which Aladdin has hidden under his turban.
Aladdin floats down on the carpet from Abu's back.
ALADDIN
(his voice deeper) (bows
low)
Your Majesty ... I have journeyed
from afar to seek your daughter's
hand. Allow me to.present myself.
I am--
SULTAN
Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course! I'm
delighted to meet you .. This is
my Royal Vizier, Jafar. He's
delighted, too.
Aladdin raises an eyebrow--Jafar looks familiar.
JAFAR
Ecstatic.
48.
Hearing the voice, Aladdin recognizes him. He spins away, hiding
his face.
ALADDIN
(trying to cover)
And this is--is--
Abu, too, has recognized Jafar. His knees are shaking.
ALADDIN
--my pet elephant, Ab--uh,
Abigail.
Abu looks miffed--then smiles weakly, curtseys.
ALADDIN
(sotto, to Abu)
The guy from the cave! We're dead.
He's gonna recognize us--
A miniature Genie slips down from Aladdin's turban.
GENIE
(sot to)
Hey, Al--Don't get your sash in
a knot. Trust the magicl
...
He re-hides. Aladdin takes a deep breath, turns back, resuming
his prince attitude--
Jafar--and Iago--are staring at him coldly.
JAFAR
I'm afraid, Prince . .. Aboohoo--
ALADDIN
Ababwa.
JAFAR ... whatever. You cannot just
parade in here uninvited and
expect to--
SULTAN
{examines the Carpet)
What a wonderful device! May I--?
He gestures 'take it for a spin?'
ALADDIN
Why, certainly, your Majesty ... Allow me ...
He helps the Sultan to sit on the ~arpet.
JAFAR
Sire--I must advise against this!
These cheap parlor tricks can be
quite dangerous.
IAGO
Cheap! Cheap!
SULTAN
Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to
have a little fun.
(the carpet lifts)
Amazing!
4 9.
It's a little precarious--the carpet must rescue him once--but
the Sultan gets the hang of flying~ Does a loop.
JAFAR
(to Aladdin)
Just where did you say yo~ were
from ... ?
ALADDIN
Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure ...
JAFAR
Tz:y, me ...
The Sultan buzzes him. Iago squawks, goes aloft. The Sultan
chases him around the room, laughing. Iago does not enjoy it.
The Carpet comes in for a landing. It stops, forms a slide. The
Sultan dismounts with a flourish, having done no work at all.
JAFAR
Spectacular, your Highness.
SULTAN
Yes, I do seem to have a knack
for it ... (more)
SULTAN (Cont'd)
(considering Aladdin)
This is a very impressive youth--
and a prince, besides ... (sotto, to Jafar)
If we're lucky, you won't have
to marry Jasmine after all ...
Jafar is aghast--covers it quickly.
JAFAR . (sotto, to the Sultan)
I don't trust him. He seems ... duplicitous.
SULTAN
Nonsense! One thing I pride myself
on, Jafar--I'm an excellent judge
of character.
(very sure)
Jasmine will like this one.
ALADDIN
(a private smile)
And I'm pretty sure I'll like
Princess Jasmine ...
JAFAR
Your highness-~No! I must intercede--
on the poor girl's behalf.
50.
Unnoticed, Jasmine, Raja behind her, has entered from the
garden. Aladdin's back is to her.
JAFAR . This boy is no different from the
others. He has nice things--but
possessions are not the measure
of a man! What makes him think he
is worthy?
ALADDIN
(very confident)
I am Prince Ali Ababwa! Sultan,
just let her meet rne--I will win
your daughter!
JASMINE
How dare you! I am no prize to be
won!
Aladdin spins. Jasmine turns on her heel, strides out.
IAGO
No prize ... to be won!
Raja pauses. He sniffs the air suspiciously.
Aladdin is crestfallen.
SULTA.~
Er ... don't worry, Prince Ali. My
daughter is a bit ... independent.
Give her time to cool down, and
I'm sure she'll warm to you ...
JAFAR
(sinister, to Iago)
I will make certain he never has
the time ...
51.
Raja has sniffed up to Abu. He growls. Abu turns to face him--
and is terrified. Abu trumpets, and stampedes-- _ The dust settles. Only a pleased Iago is left standing.
Abu clings to a chandelier, treed by Raja.
SULTAN
Your elephant seems a bit highstrung.
ALADDIN
Er ... he's allergic to cats ...
The chandelier cable snaps. Abu plumrnets--onto Iago.
EXT. MENAGERIE - NIGHT
P.O.V., ALADDIN, looking up toward Jasmine's balcony, above the
menagerie. Jasmine gazes out toward the horizon. She turns,
disappears inside.
ALADDIN (0. S.)
First that old guy turni out to
be the Royal Vizier ... Now Jasmine
won't even let me talk to her ...
Aladdin paces in the menagerie. Abu watches the Genie and the
Carpet play chess. The Carpet makes a move, sits back, smug.
ALADDIN
I should have known I couldn't
pull off this stupid prince
wish ...
GENIE
Maybe it's time to go for wish
numero two-o •. ?
Aladdin makes a dismissive gesture. The Genie examines the
chessboard, downcast.
GENIE
I can't believe I'm losing to a
rug ...
Abu notices he's at eye-level with a banana tree. He takes a
whole bunch in his trunk, squeezes it into his mouth. Takes
another.
ALADDIN
(to Genie)
What am I going to do?
GENIE
Al, I been around awhile, and I'll
tell you: The first rule in the
game of love is--
(turns the chessmen into
checkers)
--there are no rules!
52.
He executes a multi-jump, wipes the agog Carpet's checkers from
the board.
GENIE
What you got to do is go see her.
ALADDIN
I told you--she refuses--
GENIE
Refuses to see Prince Ali.
(takes turban)
But would that stop that scrappy
little second-story man from the
backstreets of Agrabah? I think
not!
ALADDIN
(takes turban back)
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy ... street rat, .. (downcast) · ... she'd laugh at me.
(dons turban)
GENIE
(turns turban into a
lamp shade)
A woman appreciates a man who can
make her laugh.
The turban melts, reforming into the Genie.
GENIE
Listen ... Aladdin. You really ought
to be yourself.
Aladdin considers--shakes his head.
ALADDIN
That's the last thing. I want to
be.
Aladdin steps onto the carpet, dons his cape.
ALADDIN
How do I look?
The Genie regards him a little sadly. Gestures--the turban is
restored.
GENIE
(false good humor)
Like a Prince ...
Aladdin smiles. The Carpet rises~ The Genie watches it go.
Something catches his attention:
Abu, lying on his side, bloated, beside a huge pile of banana
peels.
INT. JASMINE'S ROOM - NIGHT
Jasmine dangles yarn for Raja, who bats at it.
ALADDIN (0. S.)
Princess Jasmine ...
Jasmine looks out, onto the balcony.
EXT~ PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT
JASMINE
Who's there?
ALADDIN
It's me, Prince Ali--
(remernbers Prince Ali
voice) ... Prince Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE
I do not want to see you!
She turns to go inside. He moves after her, so the room light
illumines him.
ALADDIN
(in real voice)
Please, Princess--give me a chance--
He draws up short--Raja has stepped in front of him. Jasmine
turns back to him. He's closer to her now.
JASMINE
Just leave me alone--
(starts; peers at him)
Have we met before?
Aladdin's eyes go wide. He steps back, away from her, into the
shadows. Raja advances on him, backing him clear to the rail.
ALADDIN
Uh ... no, no.
(remembers his role)
Although you may well know me by
my reputation. Prince Ali? Ababwa?
Jasmine steps closer.
JASMINE
You remind me of someone I met
in the marketplace. . . .
54.
Aladdin strikes an Ali-casual pose to avoid her scrutiny.
ALADDIN
The marketplace? Ha, Ha. I have
servants who go to the marketplace for me.
Jasmine scowls. The Carpet holds its head, shakes it.
ALADDIN
Why, I have servants who go to
the market for my servants. So
it couldn't have been me you
met ...
JASMINE
(losing interest)
No. It couldn't be.
Beside the Carpet, the Genie appears as a bee.
GENIE
How's our little beau doing?
The Carpet makes a throat-slitting gesture. The Genie shakes
his head. Flies toward the balcony.
GENIE
(grumbling) .... can't believe it ... he's never
gonna free me at this rate ... gotta
do everything ...
JASMINE
Funny, isn't it? How some people mistake having things ... with
having character.
The Genie flies up near Aladdin, who absently shoos him away.
ALADDIN
Yeah.~.those fools ...
GENIE
Bzzzt!
Aladdin looks over. Is startled.
. ··/.,.,--.......,
', ' ~, __ _..,~ GENIE
Talk about h.e.r. ...
Aladdin isn't sure. The Genie ges~ures 'go on:'
ALADDIN
Princess--Jasrnine ... You're very,
uh, very beautiful.
Jasmine rolls her eyes. Then she turns toward him.
JASMINE
I'm rich, too, you know.
ALADDIN ... yeah ...
She moves closer, seductively.
JASMINE
The daughter of the Sultan.
ALADDIN
I know.
JASMINE
A fine prize for any prince to
marry ...
ALADDIN
(very happy) ... right. A prince like me.
JASMINE
Right. A prince like you ... and
every other stuffed-shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.
Go ... jurnp off a balcony!
She strides toward her chamber. Aladdin is stunned.
GENIE
Stop her--and beeeeeeee yourself!
ALADDIN
(eyes Raja)
Yeah, right.
JASMINE
What?
ALADDIN
(covering)
Uh ... you're right.
(genuine) ... that you aren't just some prize
to be won. You should be free to
make your own choice.
55 .
.,
Jasmine is surprised. She turns, reappraising Aladdin.
ALADDIN
I'll go now.
She starts to say something ('wait a second')--
56.
Aladdin steps dejectedly off the balcony rail, into space.
JASMINE
No--!
Her cry startles Aladdin. He whirls--from Jasmine's POV, he
seems to be floating in space.
ALADDIN
What? What?
Jasmine moves forward, amazed.
JASMINE
How ... how are you doing that?
As he speaks, the Carpet rises to reveal itself.
ALADDIN
It's, uh, a magic carpet.
Jasmine moves to the balcony rail, touches the Carpet.
JASMINE
It's lovely ... (the Carpet blushes)
I've never seen a magic carpet
before.
ALADDIN
You, uh, you don't want to go £or
a ride--do you?
Jasmine does not reject the proposal.
ALADDIN
You can pretend I'm notJeven there--
I won't say a word.
This provokes a puzzled half-smile from Jasmine. Aladdin extends
a hand to her. The Carpet creates steps for her.
JASMINE
(still reluctant)
Is--it safe?
ALADDIN
Sure ... Do you trust me?
Jasmine is startled: this is just what Aladdin had said to her
earlier.
' I
\.
JASMINE
(perplexed)
... yes ...
hladdin takes her hand--
ALADDIN
Then--jump!
S7.
He pulls her up, onto the Carpet. The Carpet immediately rockets
up into the sky.
Raja watches them go. The Genie re-appears.
Sit!
GENIE
(to Raja)
(Raja sits)
Good kitty!
He vanishes. Raja spins, looking for the source of the command.
EXT. AGRABAH - NIGHT
Jasmine throws her arms around Aladdin, a little frightened by
the flight. They become aware of their proximity ... Release each
other, a little ernbarrassed--but pleased.
Jasmine looks down, sees a breathtaking view of the Palace in
the moonlight. Beyond is the city of Agrabah.
JASMINE
Where are we going?
ALADDIN
Someplace special.
(sotto, to the Carpet)
Take us someplace special.
The Carpet gestures 'no problem,' sweeps them off--
In a romantic, picturesque MUSICAL MONTAGE we follow Aladdin
and Jasmine as the Carpet takes them on a magical tour.
The Carpet takes them down, amongst a herd of running horses.
Aladdin turns it into a race, urging the carpet ahead. Jasmine
cheers when they pull ahead of the lead horse--then strokes the
surprised horse's mane, waves 'bye-bye' to it.
They sweep past the pyramids, around the Sphinx. A worker is
startled by the Carpet; his hammer blow misses the chisel, and
the Sphinx's nose crumbles away.
They cruise past Grecian temples, over a still pond. The Carpet
whips quickly through the tree branches--creates a cascade of
falling blossoms. Then moves slowly through the cascade, near
to the water. Jasmine trails a hand on the surface; the Carpet
flies an intricate pattern--the wake left by Jasmine's trailing
hand makes a beautiful design.
58.
,~
l. __ _j The carpet follows the terrain of the land, rising up over a
hill-- and before them is the Great Wall of China. They both
look at it in shared wonder.
EXT. FORBIDDEN CITY - NIGHT
Aladdin and Jasmine are perched atop a building against a
background of twinkling stars. The Carpet sits away from them,
nearer to the roof's edge, dangling its feet, applauding the--
FIREWORKS from a street festival. MUSIC can be heard.
Jasmine regards Aladdin, who watches the fireworks.
JASMINE
(casual)
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
ALADDIN
Nah ... he hates fireworks. He
doesn't really like flying, either--
His eyes go wide--he realizes what he just said. The Carpet
glances back, slaps its forehead ('what a gaffe!').
ALADDIN ... ah .•. that is ... ( looks down} ... ho-boy ...
JASMINE
(angry}
You .a..t:.e. the boy from the market--
I knew it! Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN
Jasmine, I'm sorry--
JASMINE
Did you think I was stupid?--
No!
ALADDIN
(aghast)
JASMINE
--that I wouldn't figure it out?
ALADDIN
No ... I mean, I hqped you wouldn't--
that's not what I meant--
JASMINE
Who~ you? Tell me the truth.
ALADDIN
The truth? The truth ...
...
59.
He's a little panicky--but then, he :nakes a decision. ':'he Carpet
leans forward, very interested in his answer.
ALADDIN
(quickly)
The truth is I sometimes dress
up as a commoner, to escape the
pressures of palace life.
{nods to himself)
Yeah. But I really am a prince.
JASMINE
Why didn't you just tell me?
ALADDIN
Well, you know ... Royalty, going
out to mingle with the common
people ... It sounds a little
strange.
Jasmine is sympathetic to the reasoning.
JASMINE ... not .thfil. strange.
A beat. She reaches out, touches his hand. He ta~es hers. They
smile at each other. She turns back to watch the fireworks.
Aladdin rolls his eyes, blows out an inaudible breath--he's
relieved.
The Carpet watches them, lying on its belly, head lolling on
its interlaced fingers, a little moony over the .romance.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT
The Carpet hovers; Aladdin helps Jasmine off, onto her balcony.
They both seem very pleased. She hugs him suddenly--he's a bit
surprised, but he likes it.
JASMINE
I'm so glad you're not dead!
ALADDIN
Me, too ...
(frowns)
Who said I was dead?
And then he realizes, says it at the same time she does.
ALADDIN/JASMINE
Jafar.
JASMINE
Be very careful around him. He
can't be trusted.
ALADDIN
I figured as much. Don't worry--
I can handle him.
JASMINE
Yes ... I believe you can ...
He likes the sound of that.
60.
They stare into each other's eyes. Drift slightly toward each
other, hesitatingly. Look some more into each other's eyes ...
Finally, the Carpet, impatient, does a small roll under Aladdin,
bumping him up into a kiss with her.
Aladdin and Jasmine break the kiss: we see that they are
obviously both affected by it. Jasmine recovers first.
JASMINE
Good night ... my handsome prince ...
Aladdin beams.
ALADDIN
Sleep well, Princess ...
Jasmine turns and enters her chamber. The curtain falls. Aladdin
makes a triumphant gesture.
EXT. MENAGERIE - NIGHT
Aladdin steps off the Carpet. The Genie meets him, avid for
details.
GENIE
So how'd it go? Don't keep me in
suspense. Was it the thrill of
victory, or the agony of defeat?
ALADDIN
(elated, excited)
It was great!
The Carpet settles beside the sleeping Abu, stretches mightily,
and goes to sleep.
ALADDIN (CONT'D)
She likes me. She called me
'handsome.' 'Her handsome prince.'
Wow.
GENIE
Whoa, time out. You didn't tell
her the truth?
' \
e
ALADDIN
{ashamed)
Well, technically ... r.o.
(defensive)
But she wouldn't have liked me!
She likes Prince Ali!
GENIE
I think you're underestimating
her ... Al--pal--I'rn usualiy the
last one to bad mouth magic--
(points at the Carpet)
I mean, some of my best friends
are magic ... but I've seen it wreck
homes, ruin lives--you can't let
it control you. You can't let it
change you.
ALADDIN
Look--you said romance wasn't your
thing, remember? Everything's going
fine ...
61.
A rustling in the bushes startles Aladdin and the Genie.
ALADDIN
( sot to}
Quick--hide! Get in the lamp!
GENIE
(zips into lamp)
I'm smoke!
Aladdin slips the lamp into his robe. He creeps into the bushes,
investigating. Rounds a corner, sees--
Jafar.
JAFAR
I'm afraid you've worn out your
welcome, .Prince Abooboo.
Suddenly, Aladdin is GRABBED from behind by Razoul and another
guard. Manacles are snapped on his wrists. His legs. A gag is
stuffed in his mouth.
JAFAR
I have already claimed the
princess as my own.
Aladdin reacts; struggles to break free. Razoul knocks him out.
JAFAR
Make sure he is never found.
RAZOUL
Yes, your eminence.
He and the other guard drag Aladdin away.
IAGO
Poor Prince Ali ... well, life hes
its ups ... and downs!
EXT. SEA - COASTLINE - NIGHT
62.
Aladdin is tossed from a high cliff by the guards. He hits the
water, disappears--
UNDERWATER, Aladdin sinks quickly. He revives, recognizes his
bad situation--
He draws his knees in, struggles to bring his manacled arms
around, to iri front of his body. Succeeds. Still going down ..
He reaches into his jacket, pulls out the lamp--hard to maneuver
with his hands chained, but he's got it--
He hits a jagged reef--loses the lamp. He sees it sinking away
from him. Looks up--
POV - ALADDIN: the surface is very distant, moon shining down--
Aladdin is dizzy, running short of air.
The lamp lodges on the ocean floor.
Aladdin kicks off, goes after it, desperate.
He reaches it, grabs it feebly. Can barely rub it.
The Genie appears, in a shower cap, holding a scrub brush and
a rubber duckie.
GENIE
Never fails, get in the bath and
there's a rub at the lamp--
He sees Aladdin, drowning. This is no joking matter; the props
vanish.
GENIE
Al! Make a wish! 'Genie, I want you
to save my life!'
(no response)
You gotta tell me--do you wish
for me to save your life?
(he shakes him)
C'mon, Aladdin--
Aladdin nods, barely.
GENIE
{going into action)
Good enough!
He creates a whirlpool that takes them to the surface--
--then becomes a waterspout as they break through.
As the waterspout rises:
Aladdin looks pretty bad. The Genie gestures--
GJ.
i)
~-/ The chains and gag disappear. Aladdin comes to with a start. He
looks up, realizes what has happened.
Aladdin touches the Genie's arm.
ALADDIN
Thanks, Genie.
The Genie smiles gently, nods.
GENIE
When your life passed in front
of your eyes, I hope you got my
good side.
ALADDIN
I have to get back to the
palace ...
Razoul and the second guard lead a camel down from the cliff's
edge, heading home.
The waterspout crashes down, avoiding the camel, and washes the
two guards out, back over the cliff.
Aladdin leaps aboard the. camel, spurs it to a gallop·.
INT. JASMINE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
Jasmine, smiling dreamily, unbraids her hair.
The Sultan enters. Unseen by Jasmine, Jafar is behind him. The
Sultan is tranced. Jafar's snake-staff's eyes glow each time
the Sultan speaks.
JASMINE
Papa! I just had the most wonderful
time ... with a wonderful boy. I
feel so happy!
SULTAN
(tranced)
You should be, Jasmine ... I have
chosen a husband for you .. .
JASMINE
What?
SULTAN
You will wed ... Jafar ...
Jasmine gasps. Jafar steps forward, to where she can see him.
JAFAR
Speechless, my dear? Would that
you remain this way for the
duration of our marriage ...
JASMINE
I will never marry you! Papa--I
choose Prince Ali!
i~I
. ~
JAFAR
Prince Ali left, as you wished.
Don't worry--wherever he went,
I'm sure he made quite a splash.
IAGO
Quite a splash!
JASMINE
Papa, Ali wouldn't have left!
SULTAN
Jafar ... always tells the truth.
JASMINE
He's lying! I .kn.ml it!
JAFAR
And can you prove it?
ALADDIN (O.S.)
I can!
G4.
He stands in the doorway, recovered from his ordeal. Iago has
a near-cardiac arrest. Jafar is stunned, then frowns,
suspicious .
ALADDIN
Jafar ordered me to be killed!
JAFAR
(recovering}
Sultan, surely you don't.believe
him over~?
The Genie appears, unseen. He scowls, sensing something.
GENIE
(sotto, to himself)
Someone's doing magic here--and
it's not ~- ..
The Genie spots the snake's glowing eyes.
GENIE
(very alarmed)
Uh-oh!
SULTAN
Jafar ... always tells the truth ...
JASMINE
Papa ... you've got to believe us!
The Genie, very small, pops in beside Aladdin's ear.
GENIE
Al--the staff!
·c)
65.
Jafar starts, then stares, mouth agape--h 0 '~ seen the GPnie.
SULTAN
Jasmine will wed ... Jafar ...
Aladdin leaps across the room, wrests the staff from Jafar.
ALADDIN
Maybe this will change his mind!
He smashes the head of the staff against the floor.
Jasmine stares as a green glow drifts up from it. An identical
green glow also emerges from the Sultan's eyes.
SULTAN
Oh ... oh, my ... what's wrong with
me--
(he remembers) (angrily)
Jafar! You ... traitor!
Jafar shoves Aladdin aside, grabbing back the shattered staff.
JAFAR
(a hiss)
This is not done yet, boy!
Aladdin leaps at him. Jafar throws down a smoke pellet. Aladdin
continues through, tackling only his cape. Jafar is gone.
Jasmine helps Aladdin up, embraces him.
JASMINE
Are you all right?
ALADDIN
(enjoying the contact)
I am ... now.
SULTAN
Jafar ... rny most trusted
friend .... plotting against me all
this tirne ... This is horrible, just
horrible .. .
He notices Jasmine and Aladdin. Rubs his eyes, gapes.
SULTAN
Can this be true? My daughter has
chosen a suitor?
Jasmine smiles at him, nods.
SULTAN
I knew it!
(he hugs Aladdin}
Oh, you brilliant boy! I'd kiss
you-- but I'll leave that to my
daughter.
(more)
SULTAN (Cont'd)
(J..laddin beams)
You two will be wed at once! You'll
be happy, and prosperous ... and
then you will become Sultan!
ALADDIN
( surprised)
... Sultan?
We PUSH IN on Aladdin.
SULTAN (O.S.)
--and ensure the happiness of all
the people of Agrabah for all of
your days!
Aladdin falters;. he looks worried.
INT. JAFAR'S LAB - NIGHT
66.
Iago, panicky, precedes Jafar in from the secret passage. Jafar
slams the door, tries to catch his breath. Iago races around,
grabbing stuff: beaker, comb, bag of parrot seed.
IAGO
I'll start packing--only
essentials. We gotta travel
light ...
Jafar LAUGHS, a bit madly. Iago stares, amazed.
IAGO
(shakes his head)
Oh, geez ... he's cracked. I could
see it coming ...
{grabs Jafar by the
collar)
Jafar! C'mon! Get a grip!
Jafar grips him by his throat.
IAGO
(strangled)
--I didn't mean it that way--
JAFAR
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged ·urchin Aladdin!
(loosens his grip)
He has the .l.a.mll, Iago.
Iago's eyes go wide with realization.
IAGO
(mumbling)
Why ... that little, two-faced,
lying, cheating ...
JAFAR
But .Y.QJ.J. are going
of it.
IAGO
JAFAR
Yes, Iago--you. Now, listen
closely. You must choose your
moment wisely ...
INT. ALADDIN'S SUITE - DAWN
,: , V, •
Aladdin enters, head down, preoccupied. Strips off his jacket
and turban, the lamp inside. The Genie pops out of the lamp.
GENIE
Huzzah! .Hail the conquering hero!
Aladdin! You've just won the heart
of the princess! What are you going
to do next?
Aladdin scowls at him. The Genie waits a beat.
GENIE
(stage whisper)
Your line is 'I'm going to ... free
the Genie!'
At the window, Abu and the Carpet look on happily.
Aladdin can't meet his eye. The Genie's no slouch; he senses
what must be coming.
ALADDIN
Genie ...
(can't look at the
Genie) ... I can't.
GENIE
Sure you can! You just go--
(moves Aladdin's mouth)
'Genie, I wish you free.'
ALADDIN
(pushes hand away)
I'm serious!
Abu and the Carpet look at each other sadly.
The Genie slouches. He is crushed. Aladdin turns to him.
ALADDIN
I'm sorry! I really am. But I can't
be Sultan! I'm not .fit. to be
Sultan!
/,
GENIE
Al--you won! You snatched victory
from the jaws of defeat! Good has
triumphed over evil!
ALADDIN
I couldn't have done it without
~! Yo.u. did it! What happens if
I'm Sultan and something really
horrible happens? Or-~what if Jafar
comes back? I need to keep my third
wish.
The Genie shakes Aladdin's hand off.
GENIE
Fine. I understand. After all,
you've lied to everyone else. Hey,
I was beginning to feel left out.
(he lets it sink in)
Now. If you'll excuse me--master.
68.
He disappears into the lamp. Aladdin rests a hand on it.
ALADDIN
Genie ... I'm really sorry.
The lamp spout raspberries Aladdin.
Aladdin's taken aback--and then angry. Grabs up the lamp.
ALADDIN
Fine! You just stay in there--until
l. order you out!
Aladdin tosses the lamp down, throws a pillow on top of it. He
sees Abu and the Carpet, watching him reproachfully.
ALADDIN
What are you guys looking at?
The two turn away from the window, walk away.
JASMINE (O.S)
Ali ... oh, Ali? Will you come here?
ALADDIN
Jasmine? Where are you?
IN THE RAFTERS: Iago throws his voice, imitating Jasmine.
IAGO
(as Jasmine)
Out in the menagerie! Hurry!
Aladdin hurries out.
Iago smiles. Glides down to the pillows. Takes the lamp

Aladdin looks for Jasmine, puzzled. She comes up behind him.
JASMINE/ALADDIN
I've been looking all over for

You've been looking for ~ .. ?
JASMINE
Hurry ... Papa's about to make the
announcement ...
She takes his hand, leads him into the palace.
INT. JAFAR'S LAB - DAY
CLOSE ON - the Lamp, in Jafar's hands.
He stares at it reverently, ecstatic.
JAFAR
At last ... The lamp ... the
Genie ... The power .. . is~-
Iago, mighty pleased with himself, blows on his claws, polishe~
them on his chest.
IAGO
The heist was flawlessly executed,
if I do say so ...
Jafar rubs the lamp--and the Genie appears.
GENIE
If you're gonna apologize, I don't
know if I wanna hear it--
He is shocked to see Jafar holding the lamp.
GENIE
Uh-oh ... You seen a little guy
around here? About yea tall, big
hat, ungrateful .. ?
JAFAR
i am your master now!
The Genie recoils, appalled.
GENIE
I was afraid of that ...
70.
EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
Jasmine's birthday celebration in progress. Gates open, thrcngs
of people cheering, waving banners, etc. The Sultan waves fer
silence. Jasmine, Raja at her side, stands behind h~rn.
SULTAN
People of Agrabah! Thank you for
joining us on this, my daughter's
sixteenth birthday!
(crowd cheers)
But there's more to celebrate!
Princess Jasmine has chosen a
suitor!
The crowd CHEERS. One cry of 'It's about time!'
SULTAN
Now, I could scarcely believe it
myself--
JASMINE
(mock hurt)
Papa!
(steps forward; to
crowd)
Allow me to present Prince Ali
Ababwa--the man I love!
Musicians strike up a reprise of 'Prince Ali' as Aladdin makes
his entrance, atop Abu the elephant. The crowd CHEERS wildly. ·
Aladdin smiles, waves. Abu looks back at him, disgusted, looks
away. Aladdin notices, turns to the Carpet. The Carpet sits,
back to him, arms crossed. Aladdin.looks uneasy.
They reach the Sultan. Aladdin dismounts. The Sultan grabs tis
hand, shakes it zealously, ushers Aladdin to Jasmine.
Jasmine looks beautiful, smiling radiantly at Aladdin.
INT. JAFARI s LAB -:- DAY
JAFAR
Now, listen, Genie. This is my
first wish: I wish ...
Jafar draws a deep breath, savouring it; the moment is finally
here. Iago looks on expectantly.
JAFAR
I wish to be Sultan!
IAGO
Yahoo! No more kissing up! No more
taking orders!
( realizing)
No more crackers!
The Genie whips out his 'Royal Recipes' cookbook.
GENIE
Lessee here ... Sultan, sultan--
Jafar slaps the book out of the Genie's hands.
JAFAR
My orders will be obeyed, slave!
Make me the Sultan!
I l •
The Genie stares at him, wary of this new master. He bows.
GENIE
(very proper)
As you command ... master.
EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
Aladdin and Jasmine move into an embrace. They're gonna kiss--
Suddenly, a magical effect swirls around the Sultan--
JASMINE
Papa!
--and then dissipates, revealing:
Jafar now stands in the Sultan's spot, wearing Sultan robes.
The Sultan has been shunted to one side, his robe and turban
gone.
Jasmine and the crowd gasp.
AL1illDIN
Jafar!
JAFAR
Sultan Jafar, Prince Abooboo.
IAGO
Or should we say ... Aladdin?
The Sultan goggles at Iago.
JAFAR
(to the crowd)
Bow before your Sultan!
Amazingly, the crowd bows.
SULTAN
What manner of trickery is this,
Jafar?
JAFAR
~o ~rickery, you rotund nincompoop--
it is ;power!
A shadow falls across the courtyard. The crowd gasps--
The Genie, huge, looms over the palace.
Abu and the Carpet clutch each other in terror.
ALADDIN
Genie--what are you doing?
GENIE
(indicates Jafar}
My master's bidding ...
Aladdin realizes what has happened. He is aghast.
JAFAR
I believe a sultan should wield
his power from a palace high above
the rabble he rules! Don't you
agree, Genie?
The Genie nods sadly. He reaches down--
72.
--An.d lifts .llI2. .the. palace (including a chunk of courtyard).
PANDEMONIUM as the crowd runs for cover from falling debris,
leap from the courtyard to avoid be carried off, generally
become hysterical.
The Genie carries the palace up to the mountains above Agrabah,
sets it down on a precipice overlooking the city.
Aladdin grabs Jasmine's hand, pulls the Sultan to his feet, runs
down the stairs.
ALADDIN
C'mon--we gotta get out of here--
JAFAR
Genie! Stop them!
The Genie's hand comes down, cutting them off. They turn--the
Genie blocks that way, too. They are enclosed.
The Genie opens his hands. Jafar stands there.
JAFAR
There is no escape! Now--bow to
me!
The three glower at him--but make no move to bow.
JAFAR
Bow to me!
JASMINE
We will never bow to you!
Jafar draws back, angry at being vexed.
JAFAR
If you will not bow, then you willcower! Genie!--I want to ensure
my will is done! I wish--
He pauses, considering--and then it comes to him.

JAFAR
I wish to be a sorcerer ... the most
powerful sorcerer in the world!
GENIE
As you command, master.
He gestures-- Jafar's snake staff, restored, magically appears in Jafar's
hand. It is bigger than before, more menacing, crackling with
power.
IAGO
Looks pretty sharp, Jafar ...
JAFAR
(in awe)
I can feel the power ...
He brandishes the staff at Jasmine. Steps toward her.
JAFAR
Now, princess--
From off-stage comes a SNARL--
Jafar spins as Raja LEAPS at him, fangs bared, claws extended--
Green energy la~hes from the staff, strikes Raja--
--in mid-leap, Raja is transformed into a kitten, his roar
becoming a 'meow.'
Iago swoops down, grabs him by the nape of the neck--
IAGO
Into the drink, you flea~bitten
rat-chaser!
--and drops Raja into the fountain.
Abu gasps--then uses his trunk to drain the fountain (saving
Raja) and then sprays it back, hosing Iago.
Jafar, pleased with his staff, focuses his attention on Jasmi~e.
JAFAR
You say you love this boy,
Princess ... but do you JmQ.H. him?
Let me show you his true self!
He aims the staff at Aladdin--
Green energy lances out, enveloping Aladdin. The beam shoots
on, striking Abu as well--he is transformed back into a monkey.
The glow around Aladdin flashes--and then Aladdin stands there,
in his rags, all princely refinement gone. He stares down at
himself.
JASMINE
(shocked)
You weren't in disguise in the
marketplace ...
ALAD:::-IN
(reaching out to her)
Jasmine--I'm sorry--
JAFAR
The Sultan orders that this lying
wretch be banished from Agrabah!
Genie!
74.
The Genie plucks Aladdin away from Jasmine, places him on a
palace tower.
IAGO
(still dripping)
And the banana-suckin' monkey,
too!
The Genie grabs Abu--the Carpet tries to pull him back, but
can't hang on. Abu is placed in the tower.
JAFAR
Genie! Get rid of them! To the ends
of the earth!
The Genie tears the tower .from its foundation, lifts it. The
Carpet, circling up behind the tower, darts into a w'indow as
the Genie cocks his arm.
ALADDIN
Genie! Don't!
GENIE
( sadly)
Sorry, Al--I haven't got a choice.
He hurls th~ tower away, like a spear, out over the horizon.
The Genie sags, shakes his head.
The Sultan still kneels, head bowed, defeated.
Jas~ine watches the tower go, terrified. Turns to look at-- , Jafar, who laughs malevolently as we
FADE TO BLACK
EXT. ENDS OF THE EARTH - DAY
A BLIZZARD rages. Aladdin and Abu huddle near a section of the
destroyed tower, shelter against the wind and snow.
ALADDIN
... I'm sorry, Abu. This is all
my fault.
(lowers his eyes)
I should have freed the Genie when
I had the chance ... (miserable) ... like I promised.

75.
He buries his face in his hands. Abt.: touches his shoulder
comfortingly.
Aladdin looks up. His features are set in determination.
ALADDIN
I have to go back. Even if I don't
have the Genie ...
(stands)
It doesn't matter if it takes the
rest of my life ... I have to tr.y
to set things right.
He steps out into the storm. Looks back at Abu.
ALADDIN ... on my own, if I have to.
Abu spots something. Points excitedly, chattering.
The Carpet, stiff as a board, whips toward them, bucking and
rolling in the heavy winds. It is heading inexorably toward the
precipice.
Aladdin leaps, grabs one of the Carpet's tassels. Is almost
hauled out over the edge with it. Abu grabs his legs, anchors
himself with his tail. Aladdin hauls the Carpet down. The Carpet
is heavily iced.
ALADDIN
Carpet! You're okay .. ?
The Carpet strains--the ice shatters.
ALADDIN
I have to get back to Agrabah.
Can you fly through this?
The Carpet looks at the raging storm. Shakes his head sadly.
ALADDIN
What if you flew straight up--
above the storm?
The Carpet considers ... strikes a determined, heroic pose.
Aladdin hops on. They look at Abu.
Abu, with a cocky smile, shrugs, hops aboard.
ALADDIN
You guys are the greatest.
They both make the same 'shucks, we know' gesture--and then the
Carpet kicks it into overdrive, flying STRAIGHT UP, through the
blizzard, through the storm clouds.
It breaks through, above the storm, and heads for Agrabah.

· ~ INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY
The Sultan, dressed in jester's clothes, balances on a large
ball as he juggles twelve smaller balls.
On the throne, Jafar lounges, enjoying the show. Iago is beside
him. The lamp rests on a beautiful pedestal.
Raja, kitten-sized, stalks back and forth inside a bird cage.
JAFAR
Servant! Another drink!
IAGO
Y'know, I think the Sultan needs
a new challenge ...
Jasmine, scowling, in leg shackles, brings Jafar another drink.
JAFAR
Thank you, Jasmine--~- You're
right, Iago.
He gestures with his staff. Green fire from its eyes transform
the Sultan's juggling balls into axes. The Sultan yelps, strains
to keep them going.
JASMINE
Papa!
(to Jafar}
Stop it! Make it stop!
JAFAR
Perhaps in exchange for a foot
massage ...
She glowers, then kneels, pulls off his shoes. Rubs his feet.
Jafar smiles, gestures with the staff. The Sultan bobbles the
axes--just as they become water balloons. The Sultan gets
drenched.
IAGO
Say, my feet are a little sore,
too ...
JAFAR
Of course. Genie!
The Genie appears in a flash of light.
GENIE
Yes ... master?
Jafar jerks a thumb in Iago's direction. Iago happily extends
his claws, wiggles them. Bummed, the Genie massages them.
EXT. SKY - DAY
The Carpet emerges from the clouds. Aladdin spots--
The Palace, high on the mountainside above Agrabah.
...
77.
ALADDHJ
There it is! ;.bu! Open your eyes!
Abu peaks out from behind Aladdin's legs. The Carpet dives--
INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY
Jafar regards Jasmine, who continues to rub his feet.
JAFAR
It pains me to see you.reduced
to this,- Jasmine. A beautiful
desert bloom such as yourself
should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world ... not
at his feet.
Jasmine looks up, startled. Jafar leans in at her, smiles.
JAFAR
What do you say, my dear? Why, with
you as my queen--
JASMINE
(through clenched teeth)
Never.
She twists his toes. He cries out in pain.
JAFAR
AAGH! You wench! I'll teach you some
respect!
He brandishes the staff toward her~-then gets a better idea.
Smiles wickedly.
JAFAR
(over his shoulder;
still watching Jasmine)
Genie ... ! have decided to make
my final wish.
GENIE
Oh-oh ... what?
- JAFAR
I wish for Princess Jasmine to
fall desperately in love with me!
Jasmine is appalled.
GENIE
Oh ... master ... There are a few
addendas, some quid pro quos--
cJ
JAFAR
(whirls on him)
Don't talk back to mf!, you big
blue lout!
ANGLE ON JASMINE, startled as she notices:
78.
ALADDIN, peering around a window into the throne room. Abu and
the Carpet at his side.
JAFAR (0. S.}
You will do what I order you to
do-- slave!
GENIE
But--
JASMINE
(a velvet voice)
Jafar ...
Jafar and the Genie look at her--rnissing Aladdin slipping in
through the window.
JASMINE
_ I never realized how truly
handsome you are ...
Both the Genie and Jafar do jaw drops. Jafar tickles the Genie
under the chin with the lamp.
JAFAR
That's better ...
He leaves the befuddled Genie, moves toward Jasmine. That's when
the Genie spots Aladdin, Abu and the Carpet, sneaking toward
the lamp.
Aladdin puts a finger to his lips--the Genie nods, zips his
mouth shut.
The Sultan hurries forward, also overjoyed to see Aladdin-- The
Genie catches him, clamps a hand over his mouth.
Jasmine puts her arms around Jafar, turning him so his back is
to Aladdin.
JASMINE
You've stolen my heart ...
Iago spots Aladdin. He is barely able to get out a PEEP before
the Carpet wraps him up tightly.
Jafar hears the PEEP and starts to turn--but Jasmine abruptly
kisses him passionately.
Aladdin stops in his tracks, stunned. Abu keeps going, heading
for the lamp.
Jasmine and Jafar relinquish their embrace.
Tha::.
JAFAR
was ...
Jafar reacts sharply. Reflected in Jasmine's eyes he sees
Aladdin. He whirls.
Aladdin dives for the lamp--Jafar gestures with the staff--a
green blast of pure force hits Aladdin, knocking him backwards
into a wall. Aladdin is stunned.
JAFAR
You have more luck than brains,
urchin--
Abu is at the lamp pedestal. He grabs the lamp·, tosses it toward
Aladdin--
--as it leaves his hand, Abu is transformed into a cymbalclanking toy monkey.
JAFAR
Child's play ...
Iago struggles free of the Carpet, plucks the lamp out of the
air. The Carpet is close behind, tackles him--
IAGO
Jafar! HELP!
Jafar motions with the staff--a bevy of wicker carpet beaters
appear, start whacking the Carpet. It lets go of Iago, tries
to evade the beaters, but a new one appears in each direction
it tries. They beat it hard, tearing it up.
The Sultan grabs up Jafar's cup, charges him.
SULTAN
Stop this at once, Jafar!
He hits Jafar, who gestures off-handedly. The Sultan becomes
a marionette; he is lifted off his feet, hung from the ceilinq.
JASMINE
Papa!
(to Jafar)
Let him go!
Jafar turns toward her.
JAFAR
Concern, my dear?
sentiment, for one
is stone!
Such a touching
whose heart
Jasmine backs away, turns, runs toward Aladdin--
Jafar gestures with the staff--Jasmine tries to scream, but no
sound escapes--she has become a granite statue.
CJ
-,, i ·-~~---·)
ALADDIN
Jasmine!
JAFAR
(points at Genie)
And Y.Q.lJ. still owe me a wish!
Aladdin leaps at him.
ALADDIN
Dead men don't need wishes--
JAFAR
Is it hot in here, boy? Or is it
just~?
80.
Jafar gestures--a wall of flame appears. Aladdin runs from it.
Swords drop from the ceiling, forcing Aladdin back toward the
flames. He dives forward to avoid getting burned. One of the
swords slashes his arm. He grabs it, uses it to ward off the
falling blades.
GENIE
All right! Go, Aladdin!
JAFAR
You stay out of this!
The Genie is cowed--but then:
GENIE
{whispering)
Go, Aladdin!
Aladdin's doing pretty well, fending off falling swords, moving
toward Jafar. The swords become anvils, and once again, Aladdin
is dodging, avoiding near death.
ALADDIN
Are you afraid to fight me
yourself, you cowardly snake?
Jafar is incensed.
JAFAR
A snake, am I? Per.haps you'd like
to see how snake-like I can be!
He grips his staff with both hands ... and then flows .in.to. the
staff, which grows, becoming a gigantic cobra, lamp in its
coils. He looms over Aladdin.
ALADDIN
Uh-oh ...
Jafar LUNGES. Aladdin uses the sword to fend him off, blade
ringing off Jafar's fangs. Jafar lunges again, again, backing
Aladdin across the room, outside, as he parries and dodges.

EXT. WIND-SWEPT PRECIPICE - DAY
Aladdin is backed to the very edge of the cliff. Jafar strikes--
--Aladdin leaps back off the cliff's edge--
Jafar's fangs dig into the ground--
Aladdin uses a branch to swing back up, landing on Jafar's
nose, hammering the fangs in further
--Aladdin sets to plunge his sword into Jafar's skull--
Iago screeches down, rakes Aladdin with his claws--Aladdin loses
his sword--
The Genie is genuinely angry.
GENIE
That's not fair!
Jafar yanks free and grabs Aladdin in his coils, squeezing--
JAFAR
You will be the first to taste
the deadly wrath of the most
powerful man in the world!
IAGO
You oughta feel honored!
Aladdin is in a very bad spot. He gets an idea, looks up at
Jafar speculatively. Jafar squeezes--
ALADDIN
( in pain)
You're not so powerful-~
JAFAR
(squeezing harder)
Is that so?
ALADDIN
... I know--sorneone ..• IIl.OI.e.
powerful ...
JAFAR
More powerful than me? NhQ?
Aladdin realizes he shouldn't say. He looks a~ay, determined.
Jafar wrenches him around, bearing down.
JAFAR
ffliQ? Tell me, boy--
ALADDIN ... never ...
And then he casts a furtive glance at the Genie.
Jafar notices it. Realization dawns.
JAFAR
The Genie ...
IAGO
Jafar--he's right! The Genie gave
you your power! He could take it
away, too!
JAFAR
That will not happen! Genie! I make
my third wish ... A wish to secure
my domination of the world. Genie--
I wish to be a Genie!
The Genie looks horror-stricken.
ALADDIN
No, Genie! Don't do it!
JAFAR
I order you, Genie! Now!
GENIE
(defeated)
Your wish ... is my command.
He gestures ....
8 L •
Magical energy swirls around Jafar. He transforms from snake to
Genie, growing larger, blue-skinned. His brain is flooded with
the secrets of the universe as his body is flooded with power.
One shies from µsing the word 'orgasmic' in a Disney animated
feature script, but ... AS HE TRANSFORMS:
JAFAR
Yes--YES! The power--the absolute
power! ... The universe is an open
book before me! Mine to command!
To control! To reshape to~
design!
He glowers down from on high, huge and mighty. He raises his
arms to gesture rnagically--
JAFAR
And I will begin by wiping the
two of you from existence--what?!
Large gold cuffs appear, clamping onto his wrists--much like
the Genie's.
JAFAR
What is happening?!
ALADDIN
You wanted to be a Genie? You got
it!
( - , -,,\

GE1HE
--and everything that goes with
it!
83.
Forming from the smoke trail at Jafar's feet, a .lm takes
shape. Darker in color, more ominous-looking than the Genie's
lamp. Jafar looks down: realization of his fate shows on his
face--
JAFAR
No! NOOOO!
Jafar is sucked down, screaming, into the lamp--
INT. THRONE ROOM
Abu is transformed back. The carpet-beaters vanish, the Carpet
restored. The Sultan is freed, re-costumed in Sultan clothes.
Raja turns back into a tiger, breaking free of the cage. Jasmine
reverts to flesh.
EXT. WIND-SWEPT PRECIPICE
Iago swoops down to the Jafar-lamp, lands on it.
IAGO
Jafar!
Suddenly, with a WHOOSH! the lamp shoots off toward the d~sert,
Iago hanging onto it, a trail of feathers left in its wake.
Aladdin breaths a sigh of relief.
The Genie
GENIE
Tell me you planned that.
ALADDIN
(a smile)
What do you think?
laughs, claps Aladdin
GENIE
Al, you little genius,
ALADDIN
Where did Jafar go?
GENIE
on the
you!
back.
To the Cave of Wonders, of
course ... ten thousand years of
imprisonment ought to mellow him
out a little.
...
Aladdin spies Jafar's staff on the floor; it dissolves back into
the old staff, finally breaking itself in two. Aladdin picks
up the shards ... flings them out over the balcony railing; they
tumble down the mountainside.

EXT. AGRABAH - DAY
The Genie carries the Palace back to its rightful place. Aladdin
rides on his shoulder.
GENIE
Am I sorry I ever gave you a hard
time! I like you a lot better than
that beady-eyed rneglornaniac!
(sets the palace down)
There--perfect!
EXT. PALACE - DAY
The Genie sets Aladdin down, shrinks, lands.
ALADDIN
I'm just glad you're all right--
GENIE
Right as rain! You won't hear
another gripe out of me!
JASMINE
(hurrying to them)
Aladdin!
(embraces Aladdin)
You were wonderful!
ALADDIN
Jasmine ... I'm sorry I lied to
you ... about being a prince.
GENIE
(butting in)
Listen--he only did it 'cause the
little heartbreaker has such a
crush on you ...
JASMINE
(she likes it)
I know ...
(saddens) ... and I can only marry a prince.
GENIE
(to Aladdin) (cracks
his knuckles)
No problern--just say the word,
and I' 11 change you back •..
ALADDIN
But, Genie--it's my last wish! , What
about ... your freedom?
GENIE
(trying to laugh it off)
Hey, it's only an eternity of
servitude ... (presenting Jasmine)
.'.Ih..u. is~!
JASMINE
Aladdin? What does .he mean?
GENIE . (letting Aladdin in on
important info)
Al--You're not gonna find another
girl like her in a million years--
believe me, I know, I've looked!
Aladdin looks from Jasmine, to the Genie, to Jasmine. He is
torn.
ALADDIN
Jasmine ... I do love you.
Jasmine smiles. The Genie does, too--bittersweet; he believes
Aladdin has chosen the girl and will wish to be a prince.
ALADDIN
Genie, I wish for ... your freedom.
GENIE
One bona fide prince pedigree,
corning up--what?
ALADDIN
My third wish is for you to be
free.
GENIE
You ... mean it? You wouldn't kid
a kidder, would you?
ALADDIN
Genie ... you're free!
The Genie is stunned. He raises his arms, looks at his wrists.
The cuffs VANISH. He is amazed.
GENIE
(getting used to it)
I'm free ... I'm f~. I'm freeee.!
YAHOO!
(executes aerobatics)
Look ma, no lamp!
(smooches Jasmine)
Sorry--just takin' liberties! I
am FREE!
JASMINE
What are you going to do?
GENIE
Are you kidding? There's a big wide
world out there, and it's just
waiting for a big wide guy like
me!
He grabs up Aladdin in a bearhug.
GENIE
You are a great kid. Now matter
what anyone says, you'll always
be prince to me.
ALADDIN
Good-bye, Genie ... I'll miss you.
er
vO.
The Genie mists up a bit. He opens his mouth to say something--
but he is actually .t.QQ choked J.U2. t.o. speak. He nods, releases
Aladdin ... waves, as he lifts into the s~y.
Aladdin turns to Jasmine. She looks at him admiringly.
ALADDIN
(takes Jasmine's hands)
I'm sorry ... but I just can't
pretend I'm something I'm not
anymore ...
Jasmine hugs Aladdin. Tears in her eyes.
JASMINE
I understand ... It's just all so
unfair ... I~ you--
The Sultan hurries up, trailing the scroll behind him. Abu and
the Carpet follow.
SULTAN
Jasmine! Aladdin! That Jafar was
such a villainous liar ... Listen!
Dlll is what the law really says:
'If, in the event a suitable
prince cannot be found, a princess
may then be wed to whomever SM
deems worthyl '
Aladdin and Jasmine are dumbfounded.
SULTAN
I guess that means you can
choose ...
(teasing) ... if you can find someone
worthy ...
67.
A beat--Abu slicks back his hair real quick--
--and Jasmine smiles a huge smile, LEAPS into 1-.laddin 's arms--
JASMINE
(pointing at Aladdin)
Him! Hirn! Him! I choose ...
(to Aladdin)
I choose you.
Aladdin is ecstatic. He twirls away with her, celebrating. The
Sultan smiles, satisfied, looks down at the scroll.
SULTAN
I thought you might say that ...
He scowls, noticing something on the scroll. Cautiously touches
it with his finger.
Like wet ink, magical Genie sparkles stick to his finger.
The Genie, small-sized, forms out of the sparkles, holding a
quill pen.
GENIE
I figured it'd make a nice wedding
present ...
The Sultan is startled. He looks over at--
Aladdin and Jasmine, who are staring into each other's eyes.
The Sultan smiles.
SULTAN
A wonderful wedding present.
(confidentially)
It was a stupid law anyway ...
They both laugh heartily. The Gerrie fades away, leaving the
Sultan c~uckling to himself.
EXT. PALACE COURTYARD - EVENING
Jasmine and Aladdin's wedding. They are on the balcony ,
overlooking the thronged courtyard. The 'Arabian Nights' vamp
begins.
Aladdin and Jasmine turn to each other. They kiss. A good one.
NARRATOR (0. S.)
SO IT GOES, SHORT AND SWEET
THEY WERE WED DOWN THE STREET ...
Abu hugs Raja. Raja licks Abu. Abu turns back to watch the
ceremony. Raja smacks his lips ('hmn--tasty'), continues to eye
Abu.
The Sultan looks very pleased with himself.
