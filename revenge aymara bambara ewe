Civil War: EPISODE III - THE SITH WAR
Near the end of the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious shows up and is ready to achieve his ultimate goal of conquering the galaxy.
Sidious is ready for his new apprentice Darth Vader to get in on the action and kill the other Jedi.
But Vader is trying to choose the dark side and marry his wife or remain loyal to the Jedi Order .

Cover, R2.
Sir, Commander Grievous' ship is forward-
who burns droids.
I’ve seen it before. That wouldn’t be hard.
- Oddball, are you a mimic? - Copy, Red President.
My status symbol. Send your team behind me.
We are in your heart, General Kenobi.
S-foils deployed in attack .
This is where the fun begins.
Let them pass through us.
They’re all on me. I got my- .
- I'm going to help them. - No.
No, they do their job so we can do ours.
Bullets wear out slowly. It is an expansion.
- U b'an degun. - U b'u lamini.

No, no, no, no-No, foyi ka no kpkp.
Surges all power units, R2. Stop the rear wheels .
We got them, R2.
Run the droids .
- I'm going to get up. Anakin yeah? - I've seen them before. Buzz in the droids.
R4, be very careful. You have a- .

- Take your fire! You are not helping her here. - I agree with you. It’s a bad idea.
I couldn’t see anything. My cockpit is smoking.
They’re all on me. It's Anakin!
- Go to the right. - Hold on, Anakin. You will kill both of them.
Get out of here. There is nothing more.
I will not leave you, Professor.
Take it, R2
Get to know each other.
R2, hit the middle eye of the buzz droid.
- Yes, you got it! - Great, R2
The commander-in-chief's command ship died ahead.
So do you think grades are overrated?
Sorry, Professor.
I have a bad feeling about it.
Where they are. Please accept them.
R2, to the governor.
Chancellor rope signal giving right- .
the viewing gallery on the roof.
I understand Count Dooku.
I found a machine. The next change?
Kaban uka sipita.
R2 , secondary . I need you on board.
Here. Download this and wait for orders .
What's going on, Captain?
Two Jedi swam into the airport sea. We are following them.
As Count Dooku said.
T'unjers ƒe ame.
Put down your weapons. I’m not throwing them away.
Roger was like that. Roger, Roger, .
Roger, roger, .
Those are all good Jedi warriors.
Did you press the change button? No, do you do that?
- No. - Well, there's more than one way out here.
We don’t want to go outside.
We want to go somewhere else. R2, operate elevator 31174 .
Come on, what is the Value of R2 ?
R2, are you a mimic?
R2, ka alifanta baara.
31174 ƒe Sea.
Go back to work. There is nothing wrong with it.
Lift 31174 ye .
R2, the ye- .
Always travelling.
R2 , the comlink .
R2, can you hear me?
R2 miawo?
¡Waw!
R2 ye! R2 ye!
Tᴐ. Tᴐ. R2, we have to grow up.
Hands down, Jedi.
R2, are you a mimic?
R2, can you hear me? R2, we go up, not down.
Hey, Friday!
Now, that’s even better.
You stupid little astro droid.
That’s how you are.
Nayranakaja! Nayranakaja!
What is that about? Well, R2 is- .
No loose wire jokes. What is a Sista?
He is trying to do it. I didn’t say anything.
It was the Prime Minister. Is he good in that regard?
Number Dooku.
Now we’ll do it together. I would have mentioned that.
You need to get help. You don’t have to compare yourself to him. He was the lord of the Sith.
Chancellor Palpatine, the Sith lords are our specialty.
Your swords, please.
We don’t want to mess things up in front of the governor.
Don't run this time, Dooku.
Megale esia lalam kokoko.
Our strength has doubled since we last met, Count.
Ok. Double the pride, double the downfall.
The other-
I find you awful, Skywalker.
There is hatred for you. You’re in pain.
But you don’t use it.
Mirror, Anakin. Mirror.
Aw k'a faga.
Kill him now.
I don’t have to do that.
Do the same thing.
Well done, Anakin.
It’s too bad to live.
Yes, but he is an unarmed prisoner.
I don’t have to do that. Not in the way of the Jedi.
It’s just natural. He cut your hand, and you wanted revenge.
Not for the first time, Anakin.
Remember what you told me about your mother and the Beautiful People?
Now we have to go before more security droids arrive.
Anakin, there is no time.
We need to get off this ship before it’s too late.
- He seems to be doing well. "Let go, or we'll never get there."
His future will be like ours.
Get ready to attack!
Taqi pilanaka, nina! Nina ye!
The elevator doesn’t work.
R2, elevator 3224 operation.
- Replace Stabilizers. - Side stabilizers.
luran magnetism! luran magnetism!
Emergency boiler boosters.
We’re level, sir.
Easy. We are in some kind of crisis.
What’s wrong with me? Wait.
- What is the answer? - Than.
R2 R2, he fell in love.
It is going to pass. Fire!
Check out the hangar bay where things are still running.
R2, taa yan.
R2, are you a mimic?
General, we have a Jedi.
They are apartment 328. Take advantage of lightning protection.
Ray shields (shoulder).
Please wait a minute. How did this happen?
We are smarter than this. It doesn’t seem to be the case.
I said it patiently. Patience?
Than. R2 will be part of it in a few hours, .
and then... deploy ray shields.
Consider? Ok.
I don’t know where he is.
Do you have a plan "B"?
Than. The conversation partner.
General Kenobi . We are waiting for you.
P'ampacht'ita is the one.
It wasn’t a great rescue. You are welcome.
Ƒewo-
It was Anakin Skywalker .
I was hoping the person you are with would be a little older….
General Grievous . You are smaller than I thought.
The Jedi are a mess .
We have work to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him.
Lightsabers would be a nice addition to my collection.
Not now, of course. And now you won’t survive.
R2.
You’re the one who leads!
Torture them!
That’s what you are. Now!
Stay with the times! Wow!
Thanks for the reply! Thanks for the reply!
The ball is on!
Don’t worry about them. The boat was around. Yes, sir.
You are a loser, General Kenobi.
Get out of here! Ride!
Time to abandon ship.
All exhaust valves can be inflated.
That is a tragedy. Would you drive a cruiser like that?
You mean do you know how to get off the rest of this stuff? Ok?
Well, anyway, I mean you don’t have to be able to do this on a plane.
You are tying yourself up.
Open the door Increase all flaps and fin drag.
We are missing something.
Don’t worry about it. We still run half the boat.
We’re getting it really fast right now.
8 is 60 years.
We have the air. You have to stick to it. Let us set the standard high.
Ka Jayapachataki sigi sen kan.

- Earth mound, facing forward. - We're coming in too hot.
Another interesting descent.
"Are you coming, Sir?" - No, I'm not in politics.
I have to tell the council.
Plus, someone has to be a poster boy.
Wait. This process is all your mind.
Let’s not forget, Anakin, you saved us from the buzz droids.
And you killed Count Dooku, and married the governor, .
carrying me on his back without realizing it.
It’s because of your education.

Look at the guys. Excuse me.
Come on, R2 Republic cannot honor you enough.
Thank you, Senator Organa.
So it can’t be the worst of them all.
I definitely agree with you there.
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
But the battle will continue until General Grievous takes his pieces.
Well, I'll do anything in parliament.
Excuse me. Sure.
Anakin was the name.
I love you, Padmé.
There were questions that you were murdered.
I want to get better.
It feels like they live together.
And it might have been, had the governor not been arrested.
I don’t think we’ll ever be taken out around the boards again.
Wait. It’s not here to stay. Yes, here it is.
II am tired of all this deception. I don’t care if they know we’re married.
Anakin, don't say that.
Is he good in that regard? You are shaking yourself.
What is going on?
Something strange happened.
And I got pregnant too.
O don- .
So, he won-It was amazing.
What are we going to do?
Now we have nothing to worry about. Okay dear?
This is an exciting time.
The happiest moment of my life.

Yes, Mr. Sidious?
Colonel Grievous, .
I advise separatist leaders to send Mustafar .
They will, sir.
The end of the war is near, General.
But Mathematics Dooku- .
His death was a great loss.
Soon the new student- .
the second is smaller and stronger.
And, I want to take my son home from Naboo.
We can go to sea, where no one will know,
where we can be comfortable.
I can go early in the morning to get her baby’s room ready.
I know that infallible truth. It is close to the gardens.
You are so beautiful.
This is because they love me so much.
Ɛ̃.
No, I love you so much.
So love blinds you?
So that’s not exactly what I’m saying.
But that may be true.
Anakin, help us!
What is it that bothers you?
Ɛ̃.
I remember when I gave you this.
How long does it take to be honest with each other?
It was a dream come true.
South?
As I used to say of my mother, .
shortly before his death.
Ƒewo?
And it’s about you.
Sita is the one who.
It was just a dream come true.
You die in childbirth.
And the baby, too?
Ao doesn't know.
It was just a dream come true.
I won’t let this one go wrong.
This baby will change our lives.
I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in parliament.
And if the council finds out you're the father, they'll kick you out-
Me- menyae. Menya.
Do you think Obi-Wan can help us?
We don’t need his help.
Our child is a blessing.
Thoughts ahead of time? Preconceptions .
The visions are your- .
They contain pain and suffering.
Do.
Are you talking about yourself, or someone you know?
That’s what it is.
Is it close to you?
Do.
Me janto siniko la, Anakin.
Fear of extinction is a path to madness.
I will not let these visions come true, Lord Yoda.
Death is a natural part of life.
Be happy with those around you who become Strength.
Worry about them, don’t worry. They thought, don’t do that.
Helping breeds jealousy.
It is a shadow of love.
What am I supposed to do, Lord Yoda?
Pull yourself up and let go…
everything you fear is gone.
You received information about the outside tires being flat.
I'm sorry. They treated me very well.
I don’t have a discussion. In short, they’re fine.
Saleucami escapes, Professor Vos sends his troops to Boz Pity.
So what is the problem?
Congress is waiting…
many modern military powerhouses are voted governor.
So that's just silly and extreme. Is that a bad thing?
It will be easier for us to end this war.
Watch out for your friend Palpatine.
Why should you be so careful?
He wants your presence. Why is it so?
He didn’t say anything. He didn’t tell the council?
That’s awesome, isn’t it? They don’t know all of this.
And it broke my heart.
Trust me, Anakin.
Kɔsɛbɛ.
I need your help, baby.
What do you mean?
I'll put it on you. Why is it so? I don't understand.
To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic.
Anakin, san 1999. Ƒe 1999 me.
I appoint you as the true representative of the Jedi Order .
I? A veterinarian?
I'm still trying, sir.
But the council makes its own choices. They will never accept it.
I think they will do that. They need you.
Look at the danger.
With the silence of this position the conference ended.
Unfortunately, this decision was made by President Palpatine.
Month egᴐme.
You have this brain, but we don’t give you a master’s degree.
Is there such a thing as that?
How do you do this? That is very sad.
That is not true.
How can you be on the council and not know it well?
Take your seat, young Skywalker.
Forgive me, Professor.
We studied every county in the Republic, .
but they have no sign of Commander Grievous.
Drink the kidney drop at Grievous.
Clean in outdoor environments .
We don’t have many boats.
How about droid attacks on Wookiees?
It’s important to send out a raiding party quickly .
He was right about that. It’s a plan that shouldn’t be lost.
Go ahead, I tell you.
We have a good relationship with Wookiees.
This is then corrected. Yoda's army of clones...
Kashyyyk’s problem is the Wookiees.
Power to you all.
What kind of nonsense is this?
Put me in the council and not the boss?
It never happened in Jedi history. That’s a shame.
Rest in peace, Anakin. You have been given great honor.
Being on the council at your age wasn’t like it used to be.
The reality is that you are too close to the governor.
The Council doesn't like it when he gets involved in Jedi affairs.
I swear I did not try to run for council. But, it’s what you want.
You and Prime Minister Palpatine seem to have a good friendship.
It has nothing to do with that.
One reason council approved the plan…
it’s that the chancellor believes you.
And? Anakin, I agree with you.
I don’t mean to put you through that. What is the nature of this?
The Council would like to keep you informed of all the actions of the governor.
They wanted to know what he was doing.
Do they want to target the governor?
But it was a lie. We’re at war, Anakin.
Why didn’t council give us that assignment when we were at the meeting?
The work does not need to be registered.
The President isn't a bad guy, Obi-Wan.
He became my friend. He’s taken care of me since I’ve been here.
So you need to provide help.
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not the president, .
who can stay in the office for a long time when his work is over.
Some members of Congress asked them to stay longer.
Yes, but control your emotions, Anakin. Something different about the place.
You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code, .
Against the Republican, against a mentor and friend.
That’s the uncertainty here. Why are you asking this question?
The counselor asks you.
Anakin wouldn't be too happy about his new job.
It’s terrible, it separates them.
I don’t think the guy can handle it.
If t each day.
With all due respect, Sir, isn’t he the chosen one?
Couldn't he destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
So says the prophecy.
This may be a misread prophecy.
I won’t be disappointed.
He never did that before.
I hope I am right.
Sometimes I wonder what is going on with the Jedi Order .
I think this war is undermining Republican principles.
Did you ever think we could have a bad conversation?
What do you mean?
What if the democracy we think we work in does not exist,
and the Republic was so bad that we fought to destroy it?
It's raining.
And you sound like a recluse .
That sounds like disobedience.
Now you are closer to the governor than anyone.
Please ask him to stop fighting and resume diplomacy.
Don’t ask me to do that.
Make a motion in Parliament where such a question is asked.
- What is the answer? - No.
You don’t have to do that. Don’t cover it up. I will help you out.
Hold onto me, guys.
Like we did on the beach in Naboo.
Long ago, when there was nothing but love.
No politics, no conlos, no war.

"You want to see it, Prime Minister." - Yes, Anakin. Draw closer to him.
I have a good news.
Our clone intelligence units search for General Grievous.
Tucked away in the Utapau area.
In my opinion, yes
We will catch the monster and end this fight.
I worry about the collective knowledge of the organization…
if you do not select it for this function.
You’re the best choice, by far.
Sit back and enjoy.
Leave us alone.

Anakin, san 1999. Ƒe 1999 me.
you know, you can't trust the Jedi Council.
If they don’t know you in their audience, they soon will.
I don't understand.
You have to understand what I expect.
The Jedi Council wants to control the Republic.
They decided to betray me.
I don't think so- Anakin.
Find your emotions.
You know, right?
I know they don’t believe you. Or members of the legislature.
Or Republicans, or democrats, for that matter.
I have to admit that my faith in them was shaken.
Sister in law?
You are asked to do something…
it makes you feel greedy, doesn’t it?
You are required to look at me, right?
I don't -
I don’t know what to say.
Remember what you have learned in the past.
Everyone who has gained power is afraid of losing it.
Even the Jedi themselves. The Jedi use their powers for good .
Well that's a theory, Anakin.
Sith and Jedi are alike in every way, .
coupled with their overwhelming desire for power.
The Sith rely on willpower for power.
They think within themselves.
And not the Jedi?
The Jedi are selfless. They are interested in others.
Ever heard of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
No, I don’t think so.
That’s not a story a Jedi would tell you.
It’s a Sith myth.
Darth Plagueis sat down to.
powerful and wise as dark lord Sith, .
can use the Force to harass midi-chlorians...
to be… to live.
His knowledge of the dark side is so great, .
and those he cares about will catch him…
rather than die.
Can he really... save people from death?
The dark side of the force is a path to many good things…
others find it inappropriate.
What happened to him?
It is very strong,
what he fears.
its loss of power.
That eventually happened, of course.
Unfortunately, everything he knows, he teaches his student.
Then his disciple killed him in his sleep.
It’s a tricky thing.
He could have saved others from death,
but not himself.
Can we learn from this power?
Not in Jedi.
All Red Units, right here!
Does Palpatine think General Grievous is in Utapau?
Part of the message is captured in a diplomatic pamphlet…
From the head of Utapau.
We have to act accordingly.
Capturing General Grievous will end this battle.
We need to move quickly and decisively.
Chancellor asked… me to do the job.
The council itself will decide who should go, .
there is no cancer.
A more experienced teacher is needed.
I agree with him. Lord Kenobi had to go.
- I agree with you. - Ayxa.
Eh.
They are very nice. The Council was adjourned .
The droids turn their giant electric motors .
And now it's time, Commander. Yes, sir.
Jalakilen!
Head to the cover!
You'll need me on this, Sir. I agree with you.
But it could just be chasing wild bantha. Teacher.
I’m satisfied with you. I don’t thank you enough to teach me.
I'm proud, and I'm sad.
I just felt that conference I felt so much.
Anakin, you are strong and smart, and I am so proud of you.
I have taught you since I was a child.
I taught you everything I know.
And you’re a bigger Jedi than I ever imagined.
But be patient, Anakin.
It wouldn’t be long before the council made him a Jedi master.
Obi-Wan and more . May the force be with you.
Good morning, old friend. May the force be with you.
Fortunately, most of this continent is here.
In the distance. I will distract them until I get there.
But don’t wait too long. Date. When did I disappoint you?
They are very nice.
The onus is on me not to destroy every droid until I can.
Save your energy.
I can't.
Or across the sea, Padmé.
Obi-Wan is here, right?
He left this morning.
What does he want to do?
A b hami on your day.
He said he was devastated.
I feel lost.
Lost? What do you mean?
Obi-Wan is my mentor.
They trust you with their lives.
What is going on.
I’m not a Jedi, I should be.
I would like to add more.
And I knew I shouldn’t.
You expect too much of yourself.
I found a way to save you. Will you marry me?
From my nightmares.
Does that bother you?
I won’t lose you, Padmé.
I'm not dying in childbirth, Ani.
I promise you. No, I promise you.
Goodbye, young Jedi.
What brings you to our distant sanctuary?
Unfortunately, the war.
just here-and there's no controversy.
With your kind permission, I need some oil…
and use your city as a base when hunting plans with Colonel Grievous .
It’s already here. We are being held captive.
They are watching us. I understand.
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.
Tell your men to hide.
If you have riders, now is the time.
Send the tank back to the ship. Tell Cody I made contact.
Can it attract more fighters? He didn’t say anything.
It won't be long before the forces of the Republic are after us here.
I am posting Mustafar's plan on the outside board.
It was a fireplace.
You will be safe there. Left?
Hmph! Prime Minister Palpatine managed to elude you, General.
Without Count Dooku, I doubt you'd be safe.
Thank you, Viceroy, .
you are not in my hands.
Your boat is waiting.
Good morning, guys.

You are a brave man.
Aw k'a faga.

I have to deal with this Jedi slime myself.

Everyone is getting out. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.
You have to bury yourself. Date.
You have to change it! You have to change it!
Come on, go ahead! Come on, everyone!
Not an army or soldiers,
you must know that you are doomed.
I don’t think so.
Ooh, eh!
Store the corners securely.
Mr. Windu, can I stop you?
Commander Kenobi's interview with Commander Grievous,
we started attacking.
Thank you, Commander.
Anakin, please take this to the governor.
For him, a picture of their intentions would help.
Ɔwɔwɔ, Karamɔgɔ.
I understand that there is a plan to destroy the Jedi .
The dark side of the regiment surrounds the chancel .
If he doesn't give up his powers and weaken Grievous after he's destroyed .
and from strength.
The Jedi Council should take control of the legislature...
so that peaceful change can take place.
It’s a dark place this idea will take us.
We have to take care of ourselves.
Chancellor (Governor).
We now have a message from Lord Kenobi.
He employs Colonel Grievous.
We just have to wait until Professor Kenobi gets to the point.
I had to be there with him.
I find myself disappointed in what the council has done.
cannot fully appreciate your abilities.
Don’t you ever wonder why you won’t be made a Jedi Master?
Menya.
I often feel so.
I was expelled from the conference.
I knew there were things in the Force that I had not been told.
They don’t believe you, Anakin.
They see your future.
They know your power is too strong to handle.
Breathe in the smoke of the lies the Jedi are spreading around you.
let me help you understand the subtleties of the Force .
How did you know the ways of the Force?
My mentor taught me all about strength.
Also the dark side of the situation .
You know the dark side?
Anakin, san 1999. Ƒe 1999 me.

If you want to be a perfect scientific leader, .

The Jedi, Anakin.
Just through me.
you can be more powerful than anyJdi.
Learn to recognize the dark side of the Force, .
and you married your wife.

What do you think of snow?
Use my knowledge. Please, please.
You are the father of the Sith.
I know what’s bothering you. Please, listen to me.
You cannot continue to be a fan of the Jedi Council.
You’ve been looking for a life since I met you…
greater than an ordinary Jedi.

- You want to kill him? - I'm very interested.
I know you can do it.
I can understand your pain.
It keeps you focused, .
it is more encouraging.
I'll give it to the Jedi Council. Very. You have to do that.
But you don’t really know their intentions, do you?
I will soon find out the truth about all of this.
You are a genius, Anakin.
Know the power of the dark side.
Opportunity saved Padme
Aaaah!
It’s not that advanced.
Mr. Windu, I need to talk to you.
Skywalker, we just got word that Obi-Wan destroyed General Grievous.
We are on track for the prime minister to return emergency powers to parliament.
He will not give up his power. I just learned a terrible truth.
I thought Chancellor Palpatine was the master of the Sith.
A Sith father?
Than. What you are looking for.
How did you know that? He knows the ways of the Force.
Learn to use the dark side.
Are you sure you are right? Sure.
Then our worst fears happen.
We need to move quickly to keep the Jedi system alive.
Sir, the governor is very difficult.
If you want to catch it, you will need my help.
Stay away from this for your own good.
I have a big problem with you, young Skywalker.
There is a lot of fear in your judgment.
I must go, Professor. No.
If what you say is true,
you will have my confidence.

He said the war was over. Okay, so let’s go back.
All the other humans will be captured and killed.
