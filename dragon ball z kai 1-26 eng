Kakarrot?

Yeah, a lower-class warrior child, right?

Nothing to do but send him off
to some frontier planet, huh?

I suppose not.

On Planet Vegeta, a baby boy
cries for the first time.

His father, and his mother planet,

are about to be destroyed by a fearsome enemy.

Freeza!

--It's Freeza-sama!
--Freeza-sama!

Everything changes now.

The fate of Planet Vegeta, of Kakarrot...

...as well as...

...your fate!

This is the end!

W-What?!

Ka... kar... rot...

Kakarrot!!

My son, Kakarrot...

Carry on my dying wish!

You must avenge the fall of
the Saiyans, and of Planet Vegeta!

And so, a baby from a
faraway planet falls to Earth.

He was a young boy who had taken
the charge of an unknown destiny.

Let's name you... Goku!

This is the tale of Son Goku.

Son Goku would grow up healthy,

and together with Bulma,

go on a journey to gather
the seven Dragon Balls,

which were said to grant any wish.

While on this journey,
Goku would meet many friends,

go through much training,

seek for greater strength, and fight.

In his battle against the Demon Clan,
who sought to rule the world,

he would increase his power even further

under the guidance of the
martial arts sage Karin-sama,

and masterfully put a stop to
the schemes of Piccolo Daimao,

who had once again become
young with the Dragon Balls.

Piccolo would leave behind
his offspring before dying.

Three years later, Ma Junior,
the reincarnation of Piccolo,

and a grown-up Goku would wage
battle in a fateful confrontation.

Following a heated battle,
Goku would claim the victory.

It's now a little more than five years later.

Goku and Chichi had abruptly gotten married,

and the people were living in peace.

However...

"Prologue to Battle! The Return of Son Goku."

Gohan-chan!

Lunchtime!

Gohan-chan!

This is a good one.

Gohan-chan!

Ah, welcome home.

Goku-sa, where's Gohan?

I'm starving!

What are you talkin' about?
Have you seen Gohan-chan?

Huh? No, I ain't seen him.

You have to hurry and eat before you leave,

or you're goin' to keep Muten
Roshi-sama and the others waitin'.

All right, I'll go look for him.

I don't think he's gone too far away.

Yeah. I'll take care of it!

I'm countin' on you!

You sure are pretty.

My name is Son Gohan.

Ah! Wait!

Mother! Father!

Gohan!

F-Father!

Sit tight! I'm coming to help right now!

Gohan!

A little farther...

--Father!
--Gohan!

Father!

Gohan!

Father! I can't get down!

I'm scared! I'm scared! Father!

Father, I was so scared!
I was so scared, Father!

Gohan...

...how did you get up here?

I-I don't know.

Gohan, let's go home.
Mommy is worried about you.

We have to be going to Old Timer
Turtle Hermit's place soon, too.

Mm-hmm.

Whoo, just about there...

W-W-What was that just now?!
A meteor?! A UFO?!

T-That's no meteor. What the heck is it?

W-Who are you...?

A battle power of just 5? What trash.

D-Don't you come near me! I-I'll shoot!

Hmph. What a frail race this is.

There's someone with a
large power here. Range 4,880.

Is that you, Kakarrot?!

W-What power is this?! it couldn't be...

Son Goku?!

No, it isn't!

You're not Kakarrot.

Who are you? Do you have
some business with me?

I have no business with you.

Then what did you come here for?
Do you want to die?

You're mighty spirited, huh?

Hmm, battle power 322. So there's
someone like you around, is there?

Still...

...you are no match for me.

What was that?! Do you know
who you're saying that to?!

Not really.

What's with this guy's power...?

Such a worthless technique.

Is kicking up dust all it does?

Is it my turn now? Well then, let me
show you a sampling of my moves.

There's another large power.

That way. Range 12,909. it's big.

The biggest power on the planet.

This time for sure, it's Kakarrot!

I-Impossible...

I-I was shaking so hard, I couldn't move...

Good afternoon!

Long time no see!

Bulma-san!

You said come pay a visit, so here I am.

Well, well, it really has been a long time.

This house is the same
as it always has been, huh?

You are so cold.

Unless someone tells you
to come visit, you stay away.

Here.

Some manju buns, as a gift.

You didn't have to go to all that trouble.

If you'd just let me touch
your boobs a little bit...

You don't appreciate my gags, same as ever.

You're the same lecherous jerk as ever!

By the way, Bulma-san, where is Yamucha-san?

Yamucha? That idiot?

How should I know about him?
I am so fed up with him,

I didn't tell him we were
all getting together today.

Let's have a blast without him!

You sure do fight a lot, huh?

They sure do.

Incidentally, where is Lunch-san?

She went off somewhere,
chasing Tenshinhan-san, five years ago.

The location of this power is
moving at considerable speed.

See? That's Muten Roshi-sama's house.

Yoo-hoo!

I-Is that...?

--Son-kun!
--Goku!

--Yo!
--Huh? What's with the boy?

Have you started working
as a babysitter or something?

He's my boy.

Y-Yours, Goku?!

Yeah, that's right. Is that strange?

Go on, say hello.

Good afternoon.

--R-Right.
--Good afternoon.

His name is Son Gohan.

Son Gohan? I see, so you've given
him the name of your late grandpa?

Yeah.

I have to say, I'm amazed.

To think that you'd be
bringing a child along, Goku...

Gohan-kun, how old are you?

I'm four years old.

Wow, he has good manners,
considering he's your son, Son-kun.

Chichi is really fussy about that.

Say, Gohan-kun, what do you
want to be when you grow up?

A great scholar.

S-Scholar?

A tail...?

Yeah.

Just like I used to have, right?

Y-You're right.

S-Say, does anything particularly
strange happen to your boy?

Strange?

F-For example, does he change
at all on nights with a full moon?

Nights with a full moon?

I don't know. We go to bed early at my house.

--How come?
--N-Never mind, it's nothing.

If that's the case, then all right.

S-Say, Goku, is he strong, like you are?

About that...

I think he's got quite a bit of power,

but when I try to train Gohan, Chichi gets mad.

Rock, paper, scissors!

What for? That's such a waste, isn't it?

Ain't it?

She says the world is at peace now,

so we don't need martial arts no more.

She says from now on, it's the age of studying.

So that tomboy of a girl turned out
to be an education-minded mom?

Father!

Say, is that a Dragon Ball
stuck to Gohan-kun's hat?

Yeah, that's Si Xing Qiu.

It is a keepsake from my grandpa, after all.

I searched for it, and stuck it on there.

I found San Xing Qiu and
Liu Xing Qiu while I was at it.

They're back at home.

That sure takes me back.
The Dragon Balls, huh?

--What's that?!
--What's wrong?

S-Something's coming this way.

Something's coming?

It's awesome! I sense an
awesome power! What is it?!

It's here!

Here it comes!

W-What is that?

Who is it?!

What a brutal bloodlust!

So, we finally meet.

You've grown up.

But I knew it was you at first glance, Kakarrot.

Kakarrot?

You look just like our father.

What does he mean?

W-What is this? What's he talking about?

Kakarrot, what is with
the condition of this planet?

Your mission was supposed to be
to exterminate all of humanity.

What the hell have you
been goofing around for?!

Hey, now, hold on, you.
I don't know who you are,

but go away, go away.

Shoo, shoo!

Man, it just isn't right to be
drunk this early in the afternoon.

--Okay then, go on, go on.
--Kuririn! Keep away from him!

Kuririn!

Why, you...!

What's this? A man with a tail has appeared.

Just what is his terrifying true identity?


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

The Enemy is Goku's Brother?! The Secret of the Mighty Saiyan Warriors

The Enemy is Goku's Brother?! The Secret of the Mighty Saiyan Warriors

"The Enemy is Goku's Brother?!
The Secret of the Mighty Saiyan Warriors."

A-A tail! This guy has a tail, too!

It looks like you've finally realized who I am.

Who you are?

--What do you mean?!
--Here, come over here with us.

Kakarrot...

...have you even forgotten about that?

My name ain't that
funny-sounding Kaka-whatever!

I am Son Goku!

How can this be?

You stay over there!

Hey!

Have you ever taken any strong
shocks to the head in the past?

What?

Did you hit your head hard,
say, when you were a child?

Answer my question!

I did!

I don't remember it, but I hit
my head when I was really little.

Just as I suspected.

Even so, what does it
have to do with anything?!

Goku!

A long time ago, your grandfather,
Son Gohan, said something to me.

One day, in a deep valley,

he discovered a strange object
that looked like it had fallen there.

When he got closer, he saw a baby
with a tail, inside a round capsule.

He decided to take him home and raise him,

but he had a violent disposition,
and wouldn't take to him.

He said he was at a complete
loss as to what to do with him.

But one day, he accidentally fell into a ravine,

hit his head hard, and nearly died,

but he said the baby had
an unbelievable life force,

and he ended up surviving.

What's more, he said that after that,

his violent nature disappeared,
and he became a good boy.

A-And that was me?

--Mm-hmm.
--W-What does that mean?

Are Son-kun and that guy somehow connected?

Just who the hell are you?!

Tell me who you are!

I will tell you.

You are not from this planet.

You were born on Planet Vegeta!

You are a Saiyan,

a proud member of the strongest
warriors in the universe!

--The universe?!
--Warriors?!

Saiyan?!

And I am your older brother, Raditz!

G-Goku's older brother?!

You're brothers?! No way!

Don't give me that malarkey!

Y-Yeah! if Goku is an alien,
what's he doing on Earth?!

The answer is simple. Kakarrot,
you were sent here to exterminate

the humans who are cluttering up this planet.

W-What did you say?!

We Saiyans are a highly renowned warrior race.

Our job is to travel around the universe,

looking for planets that
have good environments,

exterminating the people
already living on them,

and then selling them to aliens
seeking a suitable planet

for a high price.

Adult warriors are sent to the worlds

of those who have a high battle power,

but for lower-level planets,
like this one, babies like you are sent.

Kakarrot...

Even by yourself, a few years
should have been plenty of time

for you to have liquidated these pests.

If you had only remembered
your mission, that is.

Luckily, this world has a moon, as well.

Hey, why is it lucky that there's a moon here?

Don't play dumb!
It's when the moon becomes full

that we Saiyans really start
hitting our stride, you know!

What are you talking about?!
I have no idea what you mean!

What?

Y-You don't mean...

Your tail!

What happened to your tail?!

It got cut off and disappeared a long time ago!

H-How can that be?! You miserable fool!

It's no wonder you get along so
well with the people of this world!

Enough!

Whether I'm from another planet,
named whatever,

or you're really my brother, it doesn't matter!

Anyone who would
exterminate all humans is the pits!

I am Son Goku, and I was raised here!
Get out of here, right now!

Yeah, yeah!

You heard him! Whatever his past was,

right now, Son Goku is a
better earthling than anyone!

Goku has even saved the world! Beat it! Beat it!

I'm afraid I can't do that, you see.

The Saiyans weren't a race
of many people to begin with,

but now Planet Vegeta has exploded,

after a giant meteor collided with it.

Most of the other Saiyans
were vaporized into space dust.

Including our father and mother.

There are now only four
Saiyans left, including you.

Myself and one of the others survived

because we were off attacking another planet.

The other one got lucky because he
was sent to a planet, like you were.

Just recently, we found a nice planet

that we should be able
to sell for a very high price.

We'd like to attack it,

but it would be a bit of an uphill
battle with just the three of us.

That's when I remembered about you, Kakarrot.

Your battle power is still less than perfect,

but if you joined the three of us,
we would be able to manage.

--Stay back!
--Open your eyes, Kakarrot!

It will be fun!

I-I'm scared!

Don't be ridiculous!

I'd rather die than help you!

I see.

I've been wondering about something.

That's your son behind you, isn't it?

N-No!

It's no use trying to pretend.

What about the tail?

That proves he has Saiyan blood, doesn't it?

So what if he does?!

Since you, the father,
aren't being very reasonable,

what if I were to borrow
the son for a little while?

Keep back!

Just try to come any closer!

I'll send you flying!

Father!

--Father!
--Whoa, there!

Kakarrot, I have your child.

If you want him back alive,
you'll follow your brother's orders!

D-D-Damn it...!

Kakarrot, I'm giving you
one day, so think about it.

You don't have any choice
but to go along with us.

However, you're going to
have to show me some proof.

Oh, but it will be easy. By this time tomorrow,

you will kill, let's say, a hundred
people from this planet,

and pile up their bodies here!

You heard me. I'll be looking
forward to tomorrow.

He's my own brother's son.

If at all possible,
I'd like to avoid killing him.

I'm scared, Father!

G-Gohan!

Listen up. I'm going to say
this again, just to be sure.

You will kill one hundred
people from this planet

and pile their bodies up here, by tomorrow.

Do that, and we'll let you join us.

Of course, if there are no bodies,
it will mean the death of your son.

Y-You coward! Using a child like that!

Y-Yeah!

Right!

For one thing, there's no way
Goku could kill anyone!

That's fine.

As long as he doesn't mind if this one dies,

there's no need for him to get
those hundred bodies ready.

But...

...either way, the people of this planet

are destined to be wiped out before long.

Once we subjugate this upcoming planet,

we've decided that our
next target will be this world!

W-What?!

The three of us Saiyans
should be able to exterminate

the people of this planet in just one month.

Father!

You got that, Kakarrot?

No matter how you struggle,

you have no choice but to
join your brother and his pals.

G-Give me back the child!

I'll be expecting a positive answer from you.

For your sake, as well.

Don't think you can go against me.

With your work-in-progress battle power,

there's no way you're a
match for your older brother!

Father!

Bye, now! I look forward to tomorrow!

Gohan!

Father!

Gohan!

Are you okay, Son-kun?

S-Sorry, there was nothing
we could have done.

Goku...

Kinto Un!

Hold on! That's crazy! Don't be hasty!

Y-You can't! You'll be killed!

Damn! What should I do?!

Think.

Steady, now.

It's shocking, huh?

You unexpectedly discover you have a relative,

and it's that guy, of all people.

Your brother's strength is monstrous, and all.

His tail.

If I...

if I grab his tail hard,
his strength should slacken.

I was the same way.

B-But still, will you even
be able to grab his tail?

You can't do it yourselves!

Piccolo!

You must know well enough that
his strength is out of your league.

He isn't the sort of opponent that
you or I could take on directly.

However...

...if you and I team up,

there is a slight chance
that we could defeat him.

What on earth has gotten into you?

Don't get me wrong.

It's not like I've had my eyes
opened to peace, or anything.

I don't care about your son, either.

He just stands in the way of my
goal of world domination, that's all!

I'll team up with you,

and once we've dealt with him
and those two buddies of his...

...then of course, I plan to defeat you,

and make the world mine this time for sure!

I won't let you do that.

I won't let you do that,

but the part about the two of us
teaming up is a good idea.

It looks like there ain't any
other way to do it, huh?

That's right. We'll just have to put up with it.

As far as I'm concerned, teaming up
with you makes me want to vomit.

Bulma, let me borrow your Dragon Radar!

R-Right!

Can you keep up with Kinto Un's speed?!

Don't be absurd!

My own technique is a little different

than your pathetic Bukujutsu technique.

Let me out!

Let me out! Let me out!

Now then...

That's strange. A warning signal.

Battle power 710? it's close!

What?!

Damn, it's malfunctioning, huh?

Don't startle me like that.

We should descend now, and move in on him.

It won't work! We should keep going like this!

He uses a device.

It seems to be able to clearly
tell him his target's position,

and even their strength.

You mean, the fact that
we're closing in on him, too...?

I'm sure he's aware of it.

You don't say. That means that all
we can do is attack him head-on!

Again?

Battle power 710. Tch,
it's a malfunction, all right.

Two readings?

They're headed this way!

One... two...

Battle power 322 and 334.

One of them is the same
power that Kakarrot has!

But there's no way he'd be coming.

He has to know that there's
next to zero chance of him winning.

And he wouldn't know
where I am in the first place.

I give up. This thing is completely busted.

It can't be!

They're here!

How did you know where I was?

As if I'd tell you!

Very well, I'll ask you a different question.

What are you two doing here?

Isn't that obvious?
We came to get my boy back!

Which means that even though you're a Saiyan,

you're refusing to join us, is that it?

That's what I told you!

You intend to defy your brother?

I ain't got any brothers!

Kakarrot...

I thought you were a bit sharper than this.

That's enough yammering out of you.

His battle power just went up to 408.

Is that right? You've been
training like crazy, too?

This should make the fight go a little better.

Kakarrot is now 416!

You guys think you're stronger now?!

What?!

You make me laugh!

To think that you would just
waltz on in here at that level!

This is what it means to not know your place!

Winning a fight ain't just
about who's the strongest!

We've got ourselves a strategy!

You think you're clever, do you?

Kakarrot, I've decided to
give up on letting you join us.

After all, it looks like
you'd just slow us down.

You're a disgrace to the family! Die!

I think I'll let you in on a little
something before you die.

The two other remaining Saiyans

have an even higher battle power than I do!

A Life-or-Death Battle! Goku and Piccolo's Ferocious suicide Attack"

Goku was powerless against the
might of his Saiyan brother, Raditz.

--Father!
--Whoa, there!

Kakarrot, I have your child.

If you want him back alive,
you'll follow your brother's orders!

Will he be able to get Gohan back?


if you're just finding out
how fearsome a Saiyan is,

it's already too late.

For those who still defy me

after I've gone to the trouble of
warning them, there is only death!

He's got us.

To think that there are even
stronger guys than him out there.

It's exciting, isn't it, Son Goku?

Sorry, but this time, I ain't feeling excited.

I'm so scared, I'm shaking.

It's only natural. But that terror
will soon be turning to despair.

Never mind me, where is my son?!
Where did you hide him?!

I haven't hidden him. He was just
wailing so loud, I locked him up.

You see that hole behind you? He's in there.

Over there?

Gohan...

Father! Help me! Father!

Just sit tight, Gohan! Daddy will
help you out of there right away!

Don't be ridiculous!

There's no way you can help him!

Not when you guys are going to die first!

All right, let's do it!

We don't have any other choice!

Behind me!

Yikes!

W-Where did you go?!

Right here.

D-Damn! A-Are you all right, Piccolo?!

R-Relax. I can still manage
to fight with one arm.

It looks like your deaths are drawing near!

Hey, Son Goku, do you have
any new moves up your sleeve?

Sorry, but to be honest, I ain't got any.

You've been slacking.

And here, I've been training earnestly,
developing a new move.

What are you whispering about?

Whatever strategy you
come up with, it won't work!

It'd be easier on you if
you just croaked right away.

Can you do it with only one arm?

Yeah, that part's all right.

But it takes quite a bit of time
to build up the Ki for this move.

While I do, you fight him by yourself,

and keep his attention drawn.

You got it.

I had been saving this to kill you with.

And now, you might just
end up saving me with it, huh?

If I'm able to kill him with it,
your turn will come next.

All right, I can't wait to see it!

Now, let's see if I can keep him bottled up!

You sure are persistent!

Ka...

...me...

His battle power is going up!

...ha...

...me...

A-And his battle power is 1,080!
Unbelievable! it's still going up!

...Ha!!

You've got some nerve!

H-He caught it!

I have a present for you, now!

Die!

Battle power 1,322 ...!

H-He's concentrated all of his battle power

into his fingertips!

D-Damn! These guys are able to
manipulate their power at will!

Take this on! Makankosappo!!

H-He dodged it!

To think that you'd injure me...

You'll pay for that!

See you in Hell!

You dropped your guard, huh?

Now I've got your tail!

W-When did you manage to...

Piccolo! Now! Do that thing again!

You've outdone yourself, Goku!
Hold onto that tail tightly!

I can only use this technique one more time!

K-Kakarrot, y-you would kill your only brother?

Shut up! I told you, anyone as
cruel as you are ain't my brother!

Don't you talk about yourself like that,

not after you were about to kill me!

I-I'll stop! I've had a change of heart!

I'll leave this planet without any more trouble!

Don't fall for it, Son Goku!

He doesn't mean what he's saying!

There's no way he's going to do that!

P-Please, believe me, my brother!

Sure, I've done a lot of
terrible things up to now,

I-including to you. But I will
keep my promise to you!

Y-You mean it?

I-I mean it!

N-No! Don't let go of his tail! That's his ploy!

Please, Kakarrot! Believe me!

Son Goku!

You hapless fool! it's rare to
find anyone as dumb as you!

T-That was dirty!

But I'm not like you.
I am a first-class warrior!

I won't hesitate for a moment to kill you,

even if you are my brother!

You want me to show you
what I'm talking about? Hmm?

Suffer some more! Your death is near!

What's the matter?
Do that thing you did earlier!

H-He'll just avoid it again like this!

What?!

W... What's this?!

Impossible...

G-Gohan...?

R-Run away, Gohan...

Run away!

B-Battle power... 1,307 ?!

Stop picking on...

...my father!!

Ow!

G-Gohan...

Father!

D-Did you...?

F-Father...

Y-You little brat!

R-Run away!

Gohan, run away!

Run away! Hurry!

N-Now his battle power is just 1?

I-It changes completely,
together with his feelings.

Run away!

Gohan!

S-Stop! Don't do it! He's just...

Just a child, is that what you're telling me?

You've got to be kidding.

That kid has a battle power
far higher than you two.

I'll kill him now, before he becomes
able to better use his power.

Don't worry, though.
I'll reunite you soon enough.

In the next world, that is.

Wait!

You're the first one to ever
do this much damage to me.

But this is where it ends!

Die!

W-Why, you!

Piccolo!

Quick! That technique from before!

I've been getting it ready,
thinking this might be coming!

But I'll need... a little more time!

Piccolo! Hurry!

Make it quick!

Let me go, Kakarrot! You idiot!

With us stuck together, you won't
come out unharmed, either!

Then I'll die right along with you.

W-What did you say?!

A-Are you out of your mind?!

There ain't any other way to defeat you!

Son Goku...

I'm not going to hold back!

Nothing would be better than
having you out of the picture, too!

L-Let me go! I-I was wrong!

I won't ever come to this planet again!

Y-You're not going to trick me again!

It's no lie! D-Don't you trust
your own brother's word?!

Piccolo! Hurry it up!

Sorry to keep you waiting. Are you ready?

Do it!

Take this!

Wait!

Makankosappo!!

D-Damn it all!

D-Damn! To think that I would be...
d-done in... by these guys...

I-imagine, Kakarrot...

...g-giving up his... own life...

Son Goku can be brought
back to life in no time.

What?!

On this planet, we have some
nice things we call Dragon Balls.

By making a request to them,
any wish you desire is possible.

Even bringing the dead back to life.

D-Damn...

Still, I'm glad you told me that.

This entire situation up to now

has been transmitted to my two
companions, far away in outer space.

--What?
--W-When they learn I've been beaten, they...

...they're sure to be coming here...

They'll sweep not just you,

but everyone on this planet,

away in the... blink of an eye...

T-Those... two guys...

W-When will they... get here...?

One year... Just one year...

In one year, two more of you,
who are even stronger...

it was a short-lived celebration, huh...?

You guys are no more than worms after all...

You can rest in peace now.

You had to go and open your big mouth.

Son Goku, he's dead.

Ah! There are a few of them down!

W-Who's that still standing?

It's Piccolo!

Raditz is dead.

Seriously, how pathetic.

To think that he was killed

by guys whose battle power
was just over a thousand.

What do we do? Put this planet
on hold, and go there?

They did say something... interesting, huh?

About "Dragon Balls" or whatever.

Yeah. Supposedly, they grant any wish.

All right, let's go.

We're going to bring Raditz back to life, right?

You must be joking. We don't
need that useless guy anymore.

How does this sound?

We never grow any older, and gain eternal life?

By doing that, we'll be able
to enjoy fighting forever.

I get you. That would be great!

And that's how it happened.

I-I see.

Goku! Goku, I say!

Hey, Goku! Stay with me!

Gohan-kun is all right. He's just unconscious.

Thank... goodness...

--He's coming to!
--Goku!

...I won't have to have Chichi yell at me.

Son-kun...

K-Kuririn...

Dying is... pretty... n-nasty, huh?

W-What are you talking about,
Goku?! Get hold of yourself!

This isn't like you!

L-Looks like this time, at least, I'm done for.

D-Don't worry! We'll bring
you back to life right away!

P-Please do...

Goku...

Goku!!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Run in the Afterlife, Son Goku! The Million Kilometer Serpent Road!" 
  
I'll bet that right now, 
Goku-san and the others are 
having a fun time at the Kame House. 

I wonder if Gohan's fittin' in 
with them okay. 

Then again, he'll be fine. 

He's a well-behaved boy. 

I wish I've gone. 

Gohan-chan! 

Pa! 

Chichi, where's Gohan-chan? 

Hey, Gohan-chan! 
I brought you a whole heap 
of presents! 

Pa! 

Goku! Goku!! Goku! 
--Goku... --Hey, Goku! Son-kun, don't die! Goku! Goku! 

He disappeared! 

I get it. 
This is Kami's doing. 

He's about the only one who 
could do something like this. 

The bastard has another one of his worthless ideas. 

I wonder what he intends to do. 

Hmm... T-Then again, if it's Kami-sama, 

I suppose we can relax. 

Whatever the case, 

we have to gather the other six Dragon Balls and bring Goku back to life right away. 

Man! 

At a critical time like this, 
where could Yamucha and the others have gone off to?! 

You're the one who drove him off, aren't you? 

You know, I wonder how Son-kun's brother knew where he was so easily. 

It's that strange device he is wearing on his face. 
Apparently, it can tell an opponent's strength and location. 

--Kuririn... --R-Right! Right, right, right... That's it, there. 
Kuririn, grab it for me, okay? 

Eh? Uh, o-okay. 
He's not going to come back to life or anything, right?

Let's see, this goes like that...

This gizmo is amazing.

It's a little damaged, but I think
I can do something with it.

You're incredible, Bulma-san.

Once I take this back,
study it, and refurbish it,

we might be able to locate
Yamucha, Tenshinhan and the others.

Well, in any case, let's get
back to the Kame House.

Right. There's nothing
more we can do here, huh?

Okay then, afterward,

I'll start looking for the
Dragon Balls, right away.

Piccolo, what do you intend to do--

Just like a lizard's tail...

You guys look for the Dragon Balls.

Kami doesn't have the power to
bring people back to life himself.

But I will be taking charge
of Son Goku's son there.

W-What are you going to do?

That Gohan kid could become a powerful force,

depending on how he is trained.

If we're going to prevail
against the two Saiyans

who will be coming in one year,
we're going to need his strength.

In order for that to happen,
I'm going to have to train him.

You can't be serious.

I'm not sure that's going to go over well...

Mm-hmm, we'll have to ask Goku,
and the boy's mother, Chichi, first.

We can't afford the time!

Don't give me any trouble,
or I'll kill you, and then take him!

Once a year is up, I'll come to
your house, together with the kid.

Once you bring Son Goku back to life,

tell him he can look
forward to seeing him then.

I don't know... I don't know about this...

He's gonna die! if he's lucky,
he'll just turn out delinquent!

With that in mind, he has arrived here

in flesh-and-blood form,
wishing to be allowed to train.

Please, Great King Yama,

I humbly ask that you permit
this man to call upon Kaio-sama.

Son Goku, huh? indeed,
your marks are outstanding.

You're saying that even
though he could go to Heaven,

he wants to risk the danger of
traversing the Serpentine Road

to see Kaio-sama, is that it?

Yes, sir.

Hey, does everyone come here once they die?

--That's right.
--Even aliens?

Mm-hmm. Everyone who is
dead comes here to be judged,

to see if they go to Heaven or Hell.

Hey, just a little before I got here,

did a guy named Raditz pop in here?

Watch it! You have to say "come through here."

Yeah, he came through here, all right.

He was your brother, right?
He was sent to Hell, naturally.

He didn't make any trouble?

Oh, he made trouble. He made
trouble, but I overpowered him.

You're pretty strong, ain't you, taking
someone as awesome as he was?

Maybe I should have pops here train me!

Shh! You're being too loud!

You shouldn't be using language
like that about Great King Yama!

But...

Keep quiet! Kaio-sama is even stronger!

I heard that, Kami of Earth!

Ulp!

Once you die, maybe I
ought to send you to Hell.

P-Please forgive me!

I never imagined you
would be able to hear that!

You've got the devil's
own ears, all right! Get it?

You've no sense of humor, huh?

No...

Very well. if you want to go that
badly, you may go to Kaio-sama.

T-Thank you very much!

I'll call over a guide for you.
Go out that way and wait.

'Kay!

However...!

Don't come crying to me if you
fall off of the Serpentine Road.

Well, do your best.

This whole year will be a challenge for you.

Yeah. I'm not sure what you're getting at,

but anyhow, I'm gonna go
and see this Kaio-sama guy.

Mm-hmm.

Thanks! Say hi to Mister Popo for me!

I have to say, Earth has attracted
the attention of some real bad eggs.

This time around, things
could get really dangerous.

Even if we wished for
Shen Long to eliminate them,

I doubt he could prevail against
the Saiyans' tremendous power.

Even with Son Goku receiving
training from Kaio-sama,

just how far will he be able to come?

Only Goku's son can save us.

How is Piccolo going to raise Son Gohan?

And with only the limited
time we have, how exactly--

Shut up!

You're in the way! Would you leave, already?!

S-Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
I'm very sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

Thank you for waiting.

Now then, I will show you
to the serpent's head.

The Serpentine Road is quite harrowing.

Are you in good physical health?

No...

I'm dead, so I suppose
I ain't in very good health.

Say, what's this Kaio-sama guy like?

Sir, Kaio-sama is the gentleman

that reigns over all other
deities in the universe.

Oh, yeah? I'm sure he
must be pretty strong, then.

We can't very well not say
anything to Chichi about this.

Kuririn, you go over there
and explain the situation to her.

Eh?! M-Me?!

It sounds like she's a domineering
mother, so you're dead for sure.

Sir, we have arrived.

This is the Serpentine Road?

Yes.

What do I do now?

Please follow the serpent all the way down.

It leads to where Kaio-sama is.

It sure looks long.

Yes, sir. According to legend,
it is about a million kilometers long.

A million kilos?!

Has anyone ever made it to the end?

Over these last hundred million years,

I believe that Great King Yama
is the only one who has.

That older guy, huh?

But then, if there is
someone who's made it there,

maybe I'll be able to manage it, too.

Ah, please be absolutely
sure not to fall into the clouds.

Beneath the clouds is where Hell is, after all,

and you will not be able to return.

Oh, okay.

Aw, rats. I should have
packed something for lunch.

That's okay, sir.

You are already deceased,
so I doubt you will die of hunger.

Oh, yeah.

Well...

Oh, right! I have a favor to ask.

Yes?

Do you know Uranai Baba?

Yes, sir. She visits here once in a while.

Thank goodness! Next time she comes here,

ask her to tell Old Man Turtle Hermit

not to bring me back to life for one year, okay?

Very good, sir.

Let's see... for one year...
to Mr. Turtle Hermit, right?

Okay, let's give this a go.

So as long as I don't fall
off the snake, I'm fine, right?

Yes. Do take care.

Bukujutsu!!

"Son Goku... has been killed.

Please accept my condolences."

That might be a bit too much of a shock...

"Er, I'm sorry to have to tell you

that Goku has passed on to his eternal rest..."

But then, he is coming back to life...

That's it! I'll go with cheerful!

"Uh, Goku is dead, but he'll be
coming back to life really soon,

so there's nothing to worry about."

Ah, Kuririn!

H-H-Hello...

What are you doin',
babblin' to yourself out here?

Uh, well, er, y-you see...
a-allow me to offer...

Hey there! Long time no see!

Ah, hello! T-Thanks for saying so.

I thought you were with
Goku-sa and the others.

Ah, well, you see... t-the truth is, Goku d-d--

d-d-d--

What?

"D-Don't worry about me," he says!

Oh, so he's goin' to be late after all?

Yeah! Yes. Actually,
Goku won't be coming back...

You say he's not comin' back?

No! He is coming back to us very soon...

What are you sayin'?! I don't get it!

Now, now, let's not stand out here talkin'.

Come on in the house. Come on, come on.

Would you wake up already, son of Son Goku?!

We have to talk. Get out of the water.

Who are you? Father?!

Father! Where are you?!

Father! Father!

Father! I'm scared!

Lousy brat!

Don't give me any trouble!

Stop blubbering! Be quiet,
or I will snap your neck!

All right, listen closely
to what I'm about to say.

First, your father is dead.

You remember some of it, right?
He sacrificed himself

in order to defeat that man.

Piccolo! Hurry! Do that technique again!

Do it!

Take this! Makankosappo!!

Father is...

Whoa, don't cry! I really will snap your neck!

You've heard about the Dragon
Balls from your father, right?

Goku's friends are collecting
them now to bring him back to life.

However, that's not what the matter is!

We managed to get rid of
the guy that kidnapped you,

but he said that in another year,
there are some friends of his,

who are even stronger than he was,
who will be coming here.

When they do, even with
Son Goku brought back to life,

there isn't a chance of us
winning with just me and him.

We need your strength, too.

You're going to train to learn fighting tactics,

and defend the Earth!

Huh? Me? Nuh-uh. I can't fight at all.

Apparently, you haven't realized it yourself,

but the power you have hidden
within you is something else.

That's why you're going to
train to draw that power out,

and become able to use it effectively.

No way. I don't have that kind of power.

You want to see some proof?

What are you doing?!

Wah! That hurts! That hurts! Stop it!

That hurts! Stop it!

That hurts! That hurts!

Now, show me your inner power!

W-What the...?

A-Astonishing. It's greater than I imagined.

I'm having mixed feelings.

I'm about to raise someone

who could become my
greatest enemy in the future.

D-Did I do that?

That's right. it looks like
you're starting to understand.

Whenever your emotions
become substantially excited,

you exhibit your intrinsic inner power.

But it only happens for an instant.
We can't win that way.

I'm going to beat the way to fight into you,

and make you the ultimate warrior. Got it?

But I don't want to become a martial artist.

I want to be a great scholar.

Go ahead, then.

But do it after we defeat the two Saiyans

that will be coming here in a year.

They're planning to
exterminate everyone on Earth.

If they do that, then there is no
future, or anything else, right?

But I'm scared.

Stop your whining! Do you
want to get killed right now?!

We don't have time! We're starting right now!

Take off your top!

If my father is coming back to life,

I want to be taught by him.

Too bad. Sure, he may be strong,

but he's not at all cut out to be a teacher.

He has absolutely no sternness
when it comes to others.

You can tell that just by
looking at how spoiled you are.

Huh?

Whoops. I used up too much of
my strength, and now I can't fly.


Dragon Ball Z Kai

Wilderness Survival! A Moonlit Night Awakens Gohan!

Wilderness Survival! A Moonlit Night Awakens Gohan!

W-What should I do for training?

At first, you don't have
to do anything. Just live.

Live?

If, after six months, you've managed to survive,

I'll teach you how to fight.

No! I'll be so lonely, I'll die!

You won't be lonely.

This area is crawling with bloodthirsty beasts.

Oh, no! Don't do this!

Don't leave me here!

You don't have time to be this spoiled now!

But I...

Manage to survive this six months somehow,

and gain a little toughness first.

Both physically and mentally.

Do not forget that you hold
the key to the fate of the Earth.

Believe in your own power.

And learn for yourself an effective
way to bring forth that power.

But I...

Bye now.

Wait! Where is my food? My bath? My bed?

You think that stuff has been
prepared for you, sweet prince?

If you have to blame something,
blame your own fate.

Like I do.

Wait!

I'm scared! Don't leave me!

Kami-sama, acting strange. Something wrong?

Piccolo really is different
than he was before, somehow.

There's no doubt he's still evil,

but it feels like he's lost some of that

wily coarseness he had long ago.

Popo think so too. Old Daimao not
make Son Goku's son stronger.

What made me clearly realize that
there is something odd about Piccolo

is that when Son Goku's brother,
Raditz, was killed by him,

his soul went straight to the Next World.

Up until now, the souls of those
killed by a demon clansman

did not cross over,

and just suffered as they drifted
between heaven and Earth.

And yet, since Raditz went to the Next World,

this is clearly not the Piccolo of old.

Piccolo now has good heart?

Perhaps he has become aware

that my life, and thus Piccolo's life,
has only one year left.

One year...?

Whether that's because Piccolo
will be k*lled by the Saiyans

who will be here in one year,

or because my lifespan will run out
around that time, I don't know.

My death will mean Piccolo's death,

and Piccolo's death will mean my death.

Though I may be Kami, it's unpleasant
knowing when I'm going to die.

He must sense it, too.

He must want to leave something behind,

even if it is to Son Goku's son.

Then, Dragon Balls can only be used...

Mm-hmm. The next time will be the last one.

To think that Gohan was
that strong! I had no idea at all.

He is my child, all right!

That's right! Nothing says I have
to walk along the road, huh?

All right...

I'll get there in no time like this!

Yow-ow-ow-ow!

That was close, that was close!

That's Hell down beneath the clouds.

Help! Somebody, help!

I can't get down!

Crap!

That guide said that once I
was dead, I wouldn't get hungry,

but here I am, famished!

What? You couldn't tell them?

I'm very sorry.

You mean, not any of it?

No...

You're hopeless. Geez, you've got no spine.

That's easy for you to say.

If you saw Chichi-san's face,
you couldn't tell her that Goku died.

Well, I can't blame you.

But unless we do something...

if we write her a letter
explaining the situation,

she might understand, right?

Yes, you're right! That's a good idea!

By the way, Kuririn,
what about the Dragon Balls?

There were two of them
at Son-kun's house, right?

I forgot.

You good-for-nothing!

I'm scared! I'm cold!

I'm hungry! I'm going to die!

Apples! Some apples
have fallen here! Lucky me!

Oh, well.

It's sour! Yuck!

I want Chinese buns!
I want shaomai dumplings!

You dirty brat, making me take care of you!

I'm scared... I'm scared...

Mind you, this is the last time I help you out.

From here on, if you can't survive,

then that's all you were
ever going to amount to.

Too bright!

I can't get down!

I'm hungry!

I'm scared!

If you're hungry, you could
come down from there

and look for something to eat.

And after I told him, "Make sure you
come home before nightfall," too!

It's been a long time since
Goku's visited the Kame House.

He just got wrapped up in
talkin' about the good old days

and lost track of time.

That may be fine and all for Goku-sa,

but Gohan has his cram school!

Missin' one day of cram
school isn't that big a deal.

You're too lenient, Pa!

From here on in this world,

it's those that study who come out ahead!

I wonder if that's got it...

Hey, I'm finally done!

You've got some nerve,

kicking back and sleeping at a time like this!

You there, Old Man Turtle, stand up.

O-Old Man Turtle?

I've changed the characters in the display

to make it easier to understand.

Let's see...

206!

206? I'm not that young.

That's the number that represents
your strength, Muten Roshi-sama.

The number that represents my strength?

That's an incredible device, huh?
It can tell you that?

B-Bulma-san, how high am I?

Amazing! it says 239.

I really have surpassed you, Muten Roshi-sama!

H-Hey, are you sure it's not malfunctioning?

--I don't mean to brag, but my skills are...
--Hey!

Hey!

Who is that calling to us in such a strange way?

It's me.

Y-You're that guy who
was at Karin-sama's place...

--Armadillo!
--It's Yajirobe, ya nincompoop!

Ya screwed up my name on purpose!

Karin asked me to come here
an' deliver a message to ya!

A message from Karin-sama?

"I am aware of the whole situation."

So you, that Yamucha guy,
Ten-somethin'-or-other, and Chaozu

are to go there at once.

Huh? All of us, go to Karin Tower?

Why?

Kami-sama, ya see, says he's
gonna be givin' us trainin'.

I'm in on this, too.

R-Really?!

Yeah. I told 'im, I ain't up for fightin' them

whatchamacall'em aliens,
but he says I gotta do it, or else.

I've had it.

A-All right. I'll go find them all,
and come, right away.

Bye, then. Can't say I didn't tell ya.

Oh, yeah. Forgot somethin'.

Goku says not to bring 'im back
to life 'til them enemies get here.

Huh? W-Why not?

Word is he's gonna train
there in the Other World.

Some old lady named Uranai
Baba'll be comin' by shortly,

an' you can ask her all the details.

W-What? When?

T-Training in the Other World?

W-What the...?

Huh?

He's coming back again.

Ahoy, Muten Roshi-ssms!

It's Chichi and Gyumao!

Muten Roshi-sama, what do we do?

I haven't written that letter yet.

Muten Roshi-sama!

It has been too long! Have you been well?

Er, um, I-I suppose...

My Goku-sa and Gohan
are supposed to be here.

Where are they?

U-Um, t-the truth is...

Mumble, mumble, mumble...

He's been taken away by Piccolo Daimao?!

W-What happened to G-G-Goku?!

H-He's dead.

Chichi! Buck up!

How did something like this happen to me?

Huh?

I wonder why it's so light out.

Ah, it's the moon! Wow, it's completely round!

This is the first time I've ever seen a full m--

What?!

At this rate, Earth will be destroyed
before the Saiyans even get here!

W-What's going on here?!

Don't play dumb!
It's when the moon becomes full

that we Saiyans really start
hitting our stride, you know!

That's it!

The full moon!

Get lost!

I-I never imagined he would transform.

Is it his Saiyan blood?

I think I'm starting to understand the secret

behind his and Son Goku's power.

It looks like blowing the moon
away was the right answer.

It makes me shudder,

thinking that the Saiyans might
turn into monsters like that.

He said something about their tails, too.

Apparently, to transform,
they need their tails and the full moon.

I guess I'll pull out his tail.

Not that I have to worry about it anymore now,

but their tails seem to be
the Saiyan's weakness.

There.

I suppose I can provide you
with clothes and a sword, at least.

I'll make it the same design as your old man's.

The character on it will be different, though.

I have to go attend to my
own training, so I'm leaving.

If you can survive here safely for six months,

I, Piccolo, will personally put
you through special training hell.

So much so, you'll wish you had died.

Brace yourself for it.

I'm going to turn you into
a fine demon clansman!


Dragon Ball Z Kai

The End of the Line is Reached! Playful Trials of Kaiosama" / "The End of Snake Way! King Kai's Bizarre Test!
  

I have to go and attend my own training, 
so I'm leaving. And so, six months' time has passed. 

All right! 
Oh, is it you again? You 'll never learn, will you? 

Hey ! I'm over here! Nyah-nyah! 

Okay , I'm going to get some more meat now! 

Your tail is going to be all gone before long. 

Hmph, looks like he's gotten a little more favorable. 

A-Ain't I at Kaio-sama's place yet? 

Well, with this many people on our team, 
I'm not at all frightened by those Saiyans. 

I can't wait to see what kind of training Kami-sama will give us. 

Mm-hmm. 

We've been apart for half the year now. 
You look like you've gotten a little more favorable. 
Now then, time to start actually putting you through the wringer. 
Come at me! 
What's wrong with you?! 
Over here! 
Do not lose sight of your target! 
I can't see anything move that fast! 
You don't see it. 
You feel it. 
Yeah, that's easy for you to say... 
Ow-www! 

I still ain't able to see the end? 
The tail! I did it! 
I made it! 
Yahoo! 
Huh? 
There's nothing here! 
Aw, man, you're kidding! 
What's that? 
That's it! 
That's where Kaio-sama is! 
Yahoo! 
Sure enough! There's a house there! 
What?! 
What?! 
What?! 
W-What's wrong with the ground here? 
Damn... 
Incredible!
it's like I'm being sucked down by an unbelievable power

I-It's no use! it's like my body
is as heavy as lead! Damn it...!

I finally... made it this far...

I'm... going to meet...
Kaio-sama... no matter what!

A little farther... a little farther...

Just a little farther...

But before I do, I'm gonna
find something to eat.

Yow-w-w-w...

K-Kaio-sama? Are you Kaio-sama?

I'm sure he must be awesome,
despite how he looks.

G-Good day. I am Son Goku.

I kindly ask for your training.

Kaio-sama, teach me your martial arts, okay?

I mean, please?

I-Is that training?

You want me to move like that?

Kaio-sama, w-what's the
matter with the ground here?

Say, what are you doing there?

How about this heat?

What are you doing there?

Huh? W-Who are you?

Who, me?

I am...

...scratch, scratch, scratch...

Kaio!

Then, who's that?

That is my pet, Bubbles-kun.

O-Ohh! And here, I thought it was strange.

You're the strange one.

By the way...

That pun there was the best, don't you think?

You may feel free to laugh at it.

At what?

You must have been too tense to hear it.

What am I to do with you, honestly?

Well, I'll hit you with
another pun, no extra charge.

Hello? Hello?

That's great!

What is?

What have you come here for?

I-I was hoping to have
you train me, Kaio-sama.

Train you?

What is that?! You call that defending?!

You've got to focus your Ki more!
I'm just itching to kill you!

Training, huh? I'd be willing to do that.

Really?!

However...

...you have to pass my test first.

I'll do it once you can make me,
Kaio-sama, the wizard of gags,

laugh at one of your gags.

Eh?! Me, make a pun?!

Losing your nerve, are you?

It has to be a pretty high-level pun,
or I won't laugh at it.

Well, how about it?

It looks like this might be too much for you.

In that case, give up and go home!

M-My futon...

...flew away ["futtonda"]!

Y-Your futon... flew away...

Ah! You laughed! Kaio-sama, you laughed!

You're no slouch at this,
are you? I'll bet you're a pro!

Very well, I shall train you.

I'm going to tell you...

...my greatest gag!

N-Never mind the gags,
teach me some martial arts.

Oh, martial arts? Why didn't
you say so in the first place?

All right, try coming at me!

I'm going to see just how good you are.

What's wrong?

That's just it, there's something
that ain't right here.

My body feels so heavy, it's hard to move.

Where did you come from? Earth?

Mm-hmm.

Then it would be heavy for you, huh?

This is a small planet, but it has
tremendous gravity, you see?

I'd say it's about ten times
what you have on your planet.

So your body weighs ten times as much, too.

Try jumping for me. As high as you can.

O-Okay.

I-It's no use. I can only
go up that short distance.

To be able to jump that high
in ten times his own gravity...

This guy has a lot of promise.

Well then, I'm going to start your training.

How long do you plan on staying?

I don't know how many days I've been
running down the Serpentine Road,

but I don't think I've got that much time.

You see, these Saiyan guys
are coming to our planet

to do some awful things.

So until they do, however short that time is,

I'd like for you to train me.

The Saiyans, huh?

You've drawn the attention of
some formidable folks, all right.

Let's see...

Let me check to see when the
Saiyans will arrive on Earth.

Those are Saiyans flying there, all right.

They'll arrive at Earth in, let's see,

I'd say 158 days.

Awesome! You can tell that much?

These handy antennae are nice
and steady. Get it?

That was great!

Maybe I won't train you after all.

That was great! That was great! That was great!

Wasn't it?

But, I ain't got but 158 days
until the Saiyans arrive?

Hey, 158 days will be plenty.

If I train you on this planet for 158 days,

it will have the same value
as training back on Earth

for thousands of years.

--Really?!
--However...

...even if you do train, you won't
necessarily beat the Saiyans.

That's how terribly strong the
two Saiyans headed to Earth are.

Frankly, their strength is
even greater than mine.

Greater than yours, Kaio-sama?!

That's right.

Which means that if you
can't at least surpass me,

it will be impossible for
you to beat the Saiyans.

Well, we should get started right away.

Hey, Bubbles-kun!

First, you have to overcome
the severe gravity here.

Try to catch Bubbles-kun here.

If you can't at least move
that fast, you'll get nowhere.

A-All right.

Okay, run away, Bubbles-kun!

Hold it!

D-Damn it! My body really does feel heavy!

Damn!

All right...

Just you watch!

I'm gonna catch you!

Oh, he's already wearing
super-weighted gear, is he?

This makes me quite a bit lighter!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

The Battle With 10-Times Gravity! Goku, Your Training is a Race" 
  
It's amazing the way you eat...

You could be a little more...

Hey, how about holding back a little?

I'm full, I'm full!

The flavor notwithstanding,
at least my belly is full.

I'm getting the feeling that
this man doesn't respect me.

You know something, Kaio-sama?

I'm surprised you don't get
bored staying on this little planet.

How young you are.

There are any number of fun
things to do here, if you feel like it.

Like counting how many
blades of grass there are,

looking up at the sky,

or peeing for distance.

Lately, the hobby I've been caught up in...

...is going for drives.

Now, hurry up and catch Bubbles-kun.

Otherwise, I won't ever
teach you any martial arts.

Y-Yeah, I'll try my hardest.

All right...

Oh, yeah...

Put those heavy-looking clothes
and boots you took off earlier

back on before you start running.

That will make this more effective.

If I put those on, it will be
much, much harder to run.

I'll let you in on a little something.

The world that the Saiyans are from
had about the same gravity as here.

That's where they built up their bodies.

Are you starting to understand
the secret to the Saiyans' strength?

But there's more to it than just that.

Saiyans have an inborn fighting sense.

That's another dangerous thing about them.

Hey, that's all right. I'm a Saiyan, too!

Nice jab.

But don't let up on your attack!

Uncle!

Help me!

Don't try playing the baby
to me, you dirty brat!

Sure enough, he only displays
that latent power of his

on a night with a full moon.

Ow-w-w-w...

Hmph, it looks like you've at least gotten over

your crybaby ways during
these last six months, huh?

Say, Piccolo-san, you fought
with my father long ago, right?

That fight still isn't over yet.

If we're able to defeat the Saiyans,

your father's turn will be next.

But Father said that after you
were reborn, Piccolo-san,

you don't seem to be as
full-blown bad as you were before.

I kind of think so, too.

My mother and grandfather
were afraid of you, though.

Stop talking rubbish and get to sleep, already!

Tomorrow's training won't be
as gentle as this has been!

Right!

Damn it all...

And so, in the blink of an eye,
three weeks went by.

I doubt you know how good...

...these shao-mai dumplings taste...

That was great, that was great!

Huh? Is anyone listening?

Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it!

I've got a whole pile of potstickers!

Hold it!

Now!

So close!

Rats!

All right...!

Oh, you're sure in high spirits, huh?

--Hold it!
--I knew it! They really don't respect me!

He really is awesome, huh?

But he's not gonna get the best of me!

I'm so close...

That's it! All right!

Sure enough!

All right!

Hold it!

I did it!

I finally did it! I caught you!

He's as amazing as I thought.

He's already overcome the gravity here, has he?

He just might be able to master the Kaio-ken.

Get up, already!

Don't get cocky, just because you've
managed to dodge me once or twice.

You're still soft!

Help me!

Get back up here, by yourself!

Ten-san and Yamucha-san have
both become even more incredible!

Yajirobe, take this seriously!

Why, you...!

Yow-w-w-w-w-w!

I did it!

I did it, I did it!

Kaio-sama, what should I do next?

What should you do? Let's see...

--You're willing to do anything?
--Yeah.

Then how about grinding 
some sesame seeds?

Kaio-sama, I have to train
quickly, or the Saiyans will...

Hmph, don't be so hasty.
You still have 117 days.

That's no time at all!

What was that?

It's about time for it to come back.

Come back?

Here it comes...

That was great, that was great! Not bad at all.

Are you really all that strong?

How rude!

W-What was that?

Y-You look like a grasshopper, huh?

G-Grasshopper?

That's ridiculous!

--Ah, that was great!
--Y-You are ill-mannered.

My name is Gregory, and I look
after Kaio-sama's personal care.

Kaio-sama, the one who governs
all other deities in the universe...

"That's ridiculous!"

Ahem. You have some nerve, saying,

"Are you really all that strong?" to Kaio-sama.

There's a limit to how much
ignorance I can stand.

But I ain't got a whip.

Son Goku, you show a lot of promise!

Kaio-sama, this is no time
for you to be laughing!

This works out perfectly, Son Goku.

After Bubbles-kun, you will next
be taking on Gregory there.

This guy?

What is that look on your face for?

I was hoping to get trained
by Kaio-sama himself.

Kaio-sama, I am downright enraged!

I would like to take this fellow
down a peg for taking me so lightly!

--May I?
--Very well.

What's that?

K-Kaio-sama, that's a little
on the large side, isn't it?

Son Goku, here!

Well? Heavy, right?

Your next training is to swat
Gregory using that hammer.

With this?

Once you are able to do that,
I will train you myself.

All right, I'll try!

Hmph, as if a rookie like
you could ever catch me!

H-He's fast!

Damn!

It looks like this is going to take a while.

Ow-w-w-w... All right, I'll get you this time!

Huh...?

That little jerk!

Hold still, you!

Wait up!

He wouldn't!

I-it's nice that's he's so high-spirited...!

I swear I'm gonna get stronger than the Saiyans!

Rats!

You have all far surpassed me.

There is nothing more that
Mister Popo and I can teach you.

From here on, until the conflict is upon us,

descend back down to the ground,
and each of you hone your techniques.

The future is in your hands now.

Right!

Uh, so it's okay fer us to get outta
these heavy shirts now, right?

Do as you wish.

Guys, let's get back down there
and put the finishing touches on!

We should be able to power
ourselves up even further.

We've all become amazing!

Goku, I can't wait to see
what will become of you.

After two weeks of carrying the hammer...

Almost there!

He's relentless!

All right...!

Oh, no!

Say your prayers, Gregory!

I did it!

It'd hurt if I whacked you
as hard as I can, after all.

Wishful thinking. My body
is harder than even rock.

You won't be able to win
against the Saiyans like that.

Oh, yeah? Then again,
you've got a bump there.

Ee-yow-w-w-w!

There are still days left.

Knowing him, he might be
able to master the Kaio-ken!

Kaio-ken, something I've dreamed about,

but ended up never being able to master myself.

And also, that other surefire technique.

Kaio-sama, you promised.

You may think you're ready for this,

but my training is even
tougher than you can imagine!

Can you withstand it?!

Mm-hmm, I'll give it a try!

As long as you're aspiring to be something,

be the best in the universe!
The best under the heavens!

Both in body, and in mind! Got it?

You got it!

Sis, I'd like you to tell
the fortune of the Earth.

What's that? The future of Earth?

I want to know what will happen next year.

All right. I'll try divining it.

It's no use. This time,
not even I can predict the future.

Oh, dear.

All right! That's it!
You're starting to control your Ki!

Weak!


aDragon Ball Z Kai

Come Forth, Shenlong! The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth" 



This will be your final day of training with me.

Your punning studies may
have come up a little short,

but for the most part,
I've taught you what I know.

Let's review what you've learned up to now.

Mm-hmm.

First up is Bubbles.

Ready...

Start!

Oh! 0.8 seconds! That's a new record!

Next, Gregory.

Right.

Ready... Start!

Okay... here goes!

Huh? Ow!

1.2 seconds.

Unbelievable!

Okay, next?

All right, finally, let's check your Genki Dama.

I've been waiting for this.

All right, ready, Kaio-sama.

Mm-hmm. Okay, here we go.

See if you can track the
super speed of this giant brick.

Mm-hmm!

Here goes!

Okay, super speed!

Like it was nothing...

Well done, Son Goku. I honestly
didn't think you would be able

to handle the Genki Dama this well.

I worked hard on it.

Mm-hmm. It may sound like
I keep repeating myself,

but the Genki Dama is a technique

that lets you take a small sliver of energy

from the grass, the trees, people, animals,

and every other conceivable thing,
including the air itself,

gather it together, and then release it.

Mm-hmm. It really is an awesome technique.

Even on a planet as small as this,

the Genki Dama had that
much destructive force.

Earth, where you'll be fighting,
is much larger, compared to here.

Also, you'll have the tremendous
energy of the Sun on your side.

Your Genki Dama will have astounding power.

If you're not careful,

you could even destroy the very
planet you're trying to protect.

If you can help it, don't use it.

If, and only if there's nothing else you can do,

I give you permission to
use it just once. Got it?

Mm-hmm, got it.

I'm sure I'll be able to manage
with just the Kaio-ken.

Okay then, the day of your
battle is almost upon us.

The Saiyans will arrive on Earth tomorrow.

Huh?! O-Oh, no!

W-What? What's the matter?

Uh, listen, I didn't calculate
the time it will take you to travel

the Serpentine Road to get back!

K-Kaio-sama, ain't you capable of

whooshing me back to the lower realm?!

No, uh, I can't.

I-I've got to go back down that road?!

It took me over half a year to get here!

A-As you are now, you can
arrive there in two days.

I'll tell Earth's Kami to pick you up there.

B-But I'll still be one day over!
Everyone will be killed!

Stop your griping! Even I make
mistakes once in a while!

Now, hurry up and tell your friends on Earth

to use their Dragon Balls or
whatever to bring you back to life!

T-Tell them? But how?

Place your hand on my back,
and speak in your mind.

It will get through that way.

Really?

Like this?

Mm-hmm, like that. Hurry and tell them!

O-Old Timer, it's Goku. Can you
hear my voice? Hey, Old Timer!

Man, this girl is downright...

G-Goku? Is that you, Goku?
W-Where are you?! Where are you?!

He hears me! Old Man Turtle Hermit,
I'm still in the Next World.

I'm speaking to you through my mind

from a faraway place called Kaio's World.

T-The Next World?

Have you gotten all of
the Dragon Balls together?

Y-Yeah. We've long since gathered them.

Everyone looked frantically for
them so we could rescue you.

Thanks. So then, I hate to ask,
but could you summon Shen Long,

and bring me back to life right now?

The Saiyans will be getting to Earth tomorrow.

W-What?!

T-Tomorrow, already? That's a whole
month earlier than we thought!

Hurry, Old Timer.
I'll be just a little bit late,

but I'll definitely manage something.

Hey, Goku...!

Er, I can't breathe!

Ah! Sorry!

A-All right, got it. By the way,
Goku, what do you say?

We'd heard that you were
training in the Next World.

Any luck with that?

Mm-hmm, you bet!

I-I see. That's a relief.

H-Hey, is he all right?

Old Man Turtle Hermit is talking
to himself in the bathroom.

I wonder if he's going dotty.

Hey, get the Dragon Balls ready, right now!

That was awesome, Kaio-sama!
I got right through to him!

Naturally.

I can finally come back to life!

All right then, while we're waiting
for you to come back to life,

let me do something about that
heavy, ragged outfit of yours.

Eh? Really?

Watch.

Awesome! it's lighter!

It's not just lighter. it's made out
of a wonderfully sturdy fabric.

It can even repel minor attacks.

Thank you, Kaio-sama!

Wow, terrific! You left the
"Turtle" mark where it was!

I was worried that if I had
clothes like yours, Kaio-sama,

I wouldn't look very cool.

Well, excuse me.

Ah, I hope they bring me back to life soon!

The mark on the back is the
snazziest point on it, huh?

Hmm? Yeah!

What's wrong? You can't defeat
the enemy by just dodging him!

All right!

Whoops, I got carried away.
Was that a bit too strong?

That was no fair. You said you
weren't going to use your eyes.

Don't be such a baby!

Do you think a promise like that
means anything in a fight?!

B-But Piccolo-san, you're not the enemy.

Now, come forth, Shen Long!

It's the middle of the day,
but it's suddenly dark out.

E-Excuse me, here...

Don't touch me!

N-No matter how many times
I see it, it's still scary.

Speak your wish. I shall grant any one wish.

S-Say, um, I suppose we
couldn't say we wanted him

to dispatch the Saiyans,
and save the Earth, could we?

What are you talking about? Are you
thinking of keeping Son-kun dead?

I-It's not like that. it would be nice and easy

to just have Goku brought back
to life the next time, right?

That is an impossible wish.
I was created by Kami.

As such, I cannot grant any
wish beyond Kami's power.

Well then, please bring Son Goku back to life.

That is an easy wish to grant.

Son Goku is about to be resurrected, huh?

Which means, the Saiyans will be
coming sooner than we thought!

All right, the halo over
your head has disappeared.

You have been brought back to life!

Hooray!

--Go on, hurry!
--Right!

Remember, your enemies are evil men,

more powerful than you can imagine!

They won't let you drop
your guard for an instant!

Don't go thinking you can be
brought back to life again!

That's all right. The Dragon Balls
can only bring you back to life once.

I'll give them everything
I've got! Just you watch!

Mm-hmm.

Thanks for everything, Kaio-sama!

Once I die, I'll come see you again!

Bubbles!

--Gregory!
--Take care!

Bye, now!

Bye!

What unfathomable strength that man has.

And yet his heart is even clearer than crystal.

To think that there would be
someone like him in the lower realm.

Kaio-sama, he has become
even stronger than you, huh?

Still, his sense of humor wasn't that great.

The next time he comes here,
I'll train him on that.

Oh, hush, you. Just hush.

Wow, so light, so light!

My body feels as light as a cotton ball!

Oh, right!

This ain't no time to be thrilled.
I have to hurry!

And so, the next day at 11:43 AM...

...Earth at last allows the two
Saiyans to trespass upon her.

Papa, I'm hungry.

Oh, is it already this late?

W-What was that?

What happened?

T-This is stunning...

It looks like something fell from the sky.

S-Sure enough. That round
thing fell out of the sky.

There's one over here, too.

It's a person!

A person came out of it!

Over here, too!

It's a person!

W-What...?

So, the Saiyans are finally here.

They have an incredible Ki, huh, Piccolo-san?

T-Ten-san...

Tch, that was a lot sooner than we thought.

It's just about time for the Saiyans to arrive.

Hurry!

Guys, hold out for me!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Yamucha's Struggle! The Terrible Saibaimen"


W-Who are they?

What are they?

He called it Earth, right?
Not a bad planet, is it?

How about we say hello to
the noisily peeping chicks here?

Go easy.

W-What was that?!

W-What the hell have they done?!

W-What the...!?

I-It's unheard-of!

That greeting may have
come out a little too civil.

Leave it at that, Nappa. if you get too showy,

we won't be able to sell
this planet for a high price.

O-Oh, right.

Come to think of it, we have to look for those

whatever-they're-called balls
that can grant any wish, too.

Dragon Balls.

First thing to do is to find
the one who killed Raditz,

and get some information about
the Dragon Balls out of him.

Yeah, right.

But if the Dragon Balls were in this area,

our wish to gain eternal life
just went up in smoke,

all thanks to your mindless "greeting."

S-Sorry. it completely slipped my mind.

Well, what's done is done.

Now, let's look for the one who
has the highest battle power.

That will be the one who
killed Raditz, after all.

That's strange.

There are more than just one or two
battle power readings over 1,000 .

Why would this planet have them?

Don't lose your cool.
They're still no match for us.

Let's just find the one with
the highest battle power.

I've found him.

There are two fairly high readings together.

All right, Nappa, let's go
have some fun with them.

The cause of this large-scale
earthquake is still unknown.

Further, we are currently unable to
make any contact with Metro East,

thought to be the
epicenter of this earthquake,

and there is concern for
the safety of its residents.

T-They've finally gotten here!

Shall we go to help? I can
tell where they are with this.

Y-You'll get me to go over my dead body!

I-I'm going! I'm certain that
Yamucha-sama will be going there!

No, we'd better not.

The difference in our levels is too great.

Even if I was there, I'd just be in the way.

All we can do is stay here and
hope the others are victorious.

Son-kun, hurry back!

Hurry back!

Just hold out until I get there, guys!

This is great! This planet Earth
has fairly little gravity,

and I can just whip around!

They're moving at incredible speed!

They're heading straight for the place

where those two other large Ki are.

They're coming! They intend to come here!

Right!

Chaozu, you stay here!

No way! I'm coming, too!

There's nothing to fear.

We've gotten so much stronger
than we were a year ago,

there's no comparison.

R-Right!

There's something coming
from over there, too!

And there are others coming this way, too!

Are there more than just two Saiyans?

Is that a Saiyan?

Yo! Long time no see, Piccolo.

Oh, it's you.

What business do you have here?

Have you come so you could get in our way?

It looks like there are some other
fools about to come here, as well.

Yeah, I'm sure everyone will be coming.

I was the one who was closest.

I remember! You're the one who
was at the Turtle Hermit's place.

Yeah, I'm Kuririn. You've sure gone
and gotten more beefy, huh?

Just like Goku, when he was a kid.

You're small, but strong, right?

That's what Father always used to say.

You're going to fight with us, right?

Goku said that, did he?

That's enough chit-chat. They're here!

There they are! There's one more of them.

Now there are three tough-looking guys here.

Apparently, they are well aware of who we are.

It looks like they've been waiting for us.

That's right.

Just for the record, let me ask you...

Why the hell are you here?

That voice! I see.

You're the one who killed Raditz, right?

Voice?

Didn't Raditz tell you?

These things work as communicators, too.

He's a Namekian.

So it seems. I guess it's not so surprising

that Raditz would have been killed by him.

Namekian?

Namekians, in addition to having
above-average fighting power,

are said to possess some mysterious abilities.

I-I'm a Namekian?

I've also heard that there are some of them

that perform magician-like tricks. So that's it.

You must be the one who
created the Dragon Balls, right?

T-They even know about the Dragon Balls?!

The Dragon Balls are our main objective.

Hand them over to us, nice and easy.

You may be a Namekian, but you and
the others there are like bugs to us!

Thanks.

Because of you, I'm starting
to get an idea of my ancestry.

But unfortunately for you,

I'm not the one who made the Dragon Balls!

I specialize more in fighting, you see.

Come and see if I'm like a bug to you!

Kami-sama...

I-I didn't know.

To think that I am an alien.

No wonder I thought I was a little
different from everyone else.

Indeed, I was the one who
created the Dragon Balls long ago.

But even though it was
my first time making them,

they seemed oddly familiar.

There was probably something that
someone made on this planet "Namek,"

that were like the Dragon Balls.

Nappa, take off your Scouter.

What?

These guys alter their battle powers
in response to their fighting.

These ratings aren't reliable anymore.

Come to think of it, you're right.

That weakling Raditz lowered his guard

because of the Scouter rating,
and got himself killed.

R-Raditz is that Saiyan that
you and Goku teamed up on,

and just barely managed to beat, right?

And he's a weakling?

I know. Let's have a look
at these guys in action.

Hey, Nappa, we still have six Saibaimen, right?

Get them out.

Vegeta, you like playing around too, huh?

S-Saibaimen?

W-What are those?

There are six of them, all right.

This soil will grow some fine Saibaimen.

W-What are those?!

There.

T-Those guys are disgusting!

Your targets are those three.
Work them over, Saibaimen!

Gohan, don't lose your nerve!

Right!

You want us to start coming after you, now?

Kuririn!

Tenshinhan!

Chaozu, you came, too?

Mm-hmm.

I thought there were only two Saiyans.

Well, a lot has happened,
and there's more of them now.

It's all the same, no matter
how many of them there are.

Is that him? Goku's son?

Yeah. it looks like Piccolo
has trained him quite a bit.

Kuririn, sorry I'm late.

Yamucha-san!

Everyone's here but Goku.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5...and 6

interesting. That's exactly the
number of Saibaimen we have.

What do you guys say?

How about each of you
fight our soldiers in turn?

It will be a game.

A game?! Rubbish!

Enough of your beating around the bush,

let's settle this, right now!

Now, now, why not? it works out to our favor.

Goku isn't here yet, after all.

Fine with me.

I'll take you on first. Come and get me!

This guy is gonna be floored

once he finds out how
strong the Saibaimen are!

You go first. Hit him as
hard as you can. Got it?

Gohan!

You got him!

That's our Tenshinhan!

Amazing!

I-Impossible! The Saibaimen's
battle power is 1,200 !

They rival Raditz when it comes to power!

That just means that
his battle power is higher.

B-But...

it's a simple miscalculation.

That's not what our data says!

Nappa, these guys look like

they can provide us with a little entertainment.

V-Vegeta, how could you do that?

That Saibaiman underestimated his opponent.

I told him to go after him as hard as he could.

W-What a creep!

T-That Saiyan blew that monster
to pieces in an instant.

What destructive force!

Well, who is next?

A-All right, I'll take you on!

Wait, Kuririn.

Y-Yamucha-san?

Let me go first.

I want to show them that we've
had it with their playing around.

Yamucha-san, I could just as well--

You've already been brought back
to life with the Dragon Balls once.

If anything were to happen,
you couldn't be brought back again.

Let me take care of this.

I'm going to get rid of the
remaining five all at once.

Such a lovely friendship we're seeing.

All right, you take him on.

Okay, come and get me!
Don't go taking us so lightly!

What is this weird uneasiness?

I've got a bad feeling about this.

Piccolo, find a way to
hold out until I get there.

Please!

T-They vanished!

You fool! They're moving at high speed!

Sense out the movement of their Ki!

T-The movement of their Ki?

Everyone besides you can see them.

Eh? Everyone can see them?

All right...!

Use your whole body as your eyes.

Use my whole body as my eyes...

You see them?

I see them!

You're not getting away!

You got him!

A-Amazing...

H-He did it!

The earthlings have the upper hand!

He did it!

He did it, he did it!

Not again!

Hmph, it looks like these monsters
aren't as strong as you think.

W-What did you say?!

Don't get excited, Nappa.

I'll take care of the remaining
four myself, as well.

It looks like this time,

you're the one who
underestimated the Saibaiman.

What?!

O-Oh, crap!

T-This is bad.

Yamucha!

Yes. That's more like it.

W-What a monster! He blew himself up!

T-That's awful...

H-He's dead...

Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

Yamucha-sama!

Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

Yamucha-sama!

Y-Yamucha-san must have
had a bad feeling about this.

T-That's why he went
instead of me... Damn it...

Damn it! What am I supposed
to tell Pu-erh and Bulma-san?!

What a pathetic Saibaiman! A draw?!

What did he think he was doing,
against scum like that?!

Hey, get that filthy, tattered mess cleaned up.

D-Damn you!

Everyone, stand back!

Yamucha-san,

I will make sure I avenge you.

Let me show you the results of my training!



Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Sit Tight, Chaozu! The Screaming Kikoho of Tenshinhan" / "Sit Tight, Chiaotzu! Tien's Screaming Tri-Beam!

Let me show you the results of my training! 

Go! 

What's with the slow-motion blast? 

You got them! 

Wow, amazing! 

Kuririn, are you okay? 

Yeah... but I missed one of them. 

To hell with you! 

That's Piccolo for you. 

Just thinking that he might be our 
enemy again gives me the chills. 

Thank you, Piccolo-san. 

Don't get the wrong idea. 
As if I would rescue you. 
I was just warming up for 
the wonderful fight that's 
about to begin. 

Let's hope that's how the fight turns out. 
Well then, as you wish, shall we put an end 
to the fun and games? 
The real battle is about to begin. 

I-Impossible! 

They aren't fazed at all! 
I hit them at full power! 
That's what Saiyans are like?! 

Let I take them. I'll finish off all five of them in an instant. 
Suit yourself. However... Don't kill the Namekian. 
We have to get information about the Dragon Balls 
out of him afterward. 
Okay then, do your best to make this entertaining. 

I'll start... 
...with you! 

Let me handle this! 

Piccolo-san! 

It looks like this is going to be sort of fun. 

W-What? 

T-The whole ground is shaking... 

I-It's no use, Ten-san! 
My supernatural powers have no effect! 

T-This can't be! 

H-How can this be? 

I had no idea it would be this bad! 

Hurry! Hold on, guys! 

All right...! 

Chaozu, watch yourself! 

Tenshinhan! Dodge him.


Ten-san!

What fragile folks these are.

Now to finish you!

Damn you!

Tenshinhan-san!

Damn it! Tenshinhan!

Wait! He's had it! Let him be!

Shut up!

Stay out of this!

I can't see the bottom of the hole...

Unbelievable! What a
tremendous energy wave!

D-Damn...

Nappa, look behind you!

--Chaozu!
--Why, you...!

You little punk!

Chaozu! Get away from him!

Chaozu, that's enough! Get away from him!

T-Ten-san...

Thank you...

W-What are you talking about, Chaozu?!

Get out of there! Hurry and get out of there!

I enjoyed being together with you.

Chaozu! What are you thinking of doing?!

Farewell, Ten-san. Please don't die.

Stop! Chaozu!!

Ten-san!

Chaozu!!

He blew himself up, taking them both out.

A pretty drastic thing to do.

Nice work, for the little guy.

That was a worthless thing to do.

N-No way! How can he still
be fine?! That's terrible!

Chaozu even gave up his own life!

Chaozu... h-has already been brought
back to life once with the Dragon Balls!

He can't ever be brought
back to life again! Damn it!

I swear you'll pay for this!

It looks like you still don't
realize how terrifying we are.

All that remains for you is death!

I-It had no effect at all!

Chaozu won't be able to rest in peace!

Chaozu...

Be grateful. I'll send you to see
him in the next world, right away!

Y-You'll pay for this!

I swear you'll pay for this!

A-At this rate, Tenshinhan-san
will be done in as well!

I have to do something!

Stop!

We'll have a brief opening during
the instant when he moves to attack.

Wait for that moment.

Got that, Gohan?

Yes...

That's a good strategy.

Best of luck with that.

Are you sure you should be looking away?

You'll miss your chance.

Heh, you sure are sure of yourself.

But you'll stop making that stupid
face once Son Goku gets here.

Ho? Who's that? Your ace-in-the-hole?

Just you wait and see.

Looks like that's all for you, huh?

I'll come put you out of your misery, right now.

See you in hell!

Now! Scatter, Kuririn and Gohan!

Yeah!

I'm gonna finish you! Die!

What?!

Gohan! Now! shoot him!

Gohan!

Get yourself ready!

I-I'm too scared!

You filthy brat!

It's not working!

We missed him! Our timing was too late!

Now you've done it! You've just
shortened your own lives even more!

Fine. I've decided to change
the order that I kill you in!

Say your prayers!

I-I'm sorry... Uncle Piccolo...

What is wrong, Kami-sama?

Hmm, it would seem my life
will only last a little longer.

Death... death is closing in on me.

You cannot mean...

Piccolo is going to be killed.

And so is everyone else.

W-What about Goku?

Hmm... l still don't sense his presence.

Goku, hurry!

Ch-Chaozu...!

We've always fought together...

...and now, you can't be brought back to life!

Ten-san... I'm sorry...

Chaozu...!

You were fools to upset me.

Now, which one of you will I toy with first?

I'll leave the Namekian just barely alive.

Have to get more about the
Dragon Balls out of you, after all.

Chaozu... l will avenge you,

and then I will be coming!

I won't leave you there feeling lonely!

This is... this is my... last...

K-Kikoho!!

Oh, did he get him?!

Don't startle me like that!

I-It had no effect on him!

That monster! Is he immortal?!

C-Confound it...

Fool!

He could have just stayed down,

but he used up all his power,
and died for nothing.

O-Oh, no... not Tenshinhan, too...

This is horrible... it's a nightmare...

Everyone is dying, one after another...

Goku!! Get here, quick!!

Goku!!

Hurry!

Hurry!!

Goku?

Why do you keep saying--

Hold on...

I put another one of you away.
Now, it's your turn!

Let's get back on the ground and fight.

He's far better at fighting
in mid-air than we are.

It'll be the same, either way.

Flounder about, flounder about!

Here goes!

--Here he comes!
--Father!

Nappa! Wait!

W-What?! Why won't you let me at them?!

Don't be hasty. There's a little
something I want to ask them.

This "Son Goku" you keep
talking about is Kakarrot, right?

That's right! So what if he is?!

To think that your last
resort would be Kakarrot!

What good will he do once he gets here,

when he didn't stand a
chance against even Raditz?

He's not like he was before!
He's gotten much, much stronger!

Don't you go making light of Son Goku!

For all of that, he doesn't
seem to be coming, does he?

Are you sure he hasn't
gotten scared, and run away?

H-He'll be here! My father
will be here for sure!

And he's going to beat you guys up!

That's some faith you have in him.

This should be interesting.
We'll wait until he gets here.

You're kidding, right?! Let's put
these guys away, right now!

However, we'll only give him three hours.

We won't wait any longer than that.

This is ridiculous! I'm going to play now!

Nappa! Didn't you hear what I said?!

S-Sorry. I got a little carried away there...

That's the deal. You should be grateful.

You'll get to live a little while longer.

You can't blame him. This is
his first real fight, after all.

Hmph! What a sap I am for
expecting anything out of you.

Get lost, you pantywaist.

I have to say, though, the way that
big guy was cowering just now...

Does that mean the runt there, Vegeta,

is even more ridiculously strong?

I'm aching to do something!
I can't wait any longer!

Now, hold on. Three more hours.

In three hours, we'll be witness
to a hellish horror show.



Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Will Son Goku Be in Time?! 3 Hours Until the Battle Resumes"   


Why do we have to wait for Kakarrot?

Because he is a traitor to us Saiyans,

and we have to inflict punishment on traitors.

We're going to kill his son and his friends,

right before his eyes.

Afterward, we're going to serve
him up as well, nice and slow.

We're going to show him how powerless he is,

as he writhes in agony.

And in another three or four hours...

...we will be able to give him
a fantastic, hellish show!

I get it! So that's it! That will be great!

That is, if he gets here
in the next three hours.

You can have Kakarrot, but let
me take those other three!

Suit yourself. However...

...do it after you get the
information about the Dragon Balls

out of the Namekian.

I sure hope Kakarrot does come.

Say, at this point, why don't we run away?

There's no way we can win.
This is no time to be stubborn.

You fool! Either way, they're
planning to wipe out humanity.

We'll end up the same way
even if we don't flee now.

D-Damn! Please, Goku! Get here!

Show them how much, much
stronger than them you've become!

Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

Still not yet?

Guys, hang in there a little while longer!

Piccolo, Goku is sure to get here
in the next three hours, right?

Who knows?

Think about some way to inflict
even a little damage on them

before Son Goku gets here.

P-Piccolo-san!

P-Please train me again
during these three hours!

Don't act like a baby!

I have no need for pantywaists.
Go on and get out of here.

P-Piccolo-san...

Piccolo!

I've drilled everything into you.
You're more than just this.

Gohan! Come back!

Gohan!

Kid, are you trying to run away?

Not that that isn't the smart thing to do!

Who's running away?!

Your momma's belly button sticks out!

That little brat!

H-How did he know that my
mom's belly button stuck out?

W-We're going to try to get
as close to the scene as we can.

What on earth could be going on?
I'm not certain of the details,

but could it be that they are taking a time out?

Maybe I'll go have a little fun.

I can't just sit around here
waiting for three hours.

Do as you wish. But Nappa,
don't let it get too out of hand.

Why not?

For the sake of the hell show
we'll be having in three hours.

Oh, right, Vegeta.

I'll keep it to just a
friendly greeting. Don't worry.

One of the Saiyans has flown up into the air!

Where in the world could he be headed?

H-He seems to be headed in our direction,

and is quickly drawing ever closer!

H-He's coming after us!

He's coming!

Swing the camera around!

R-Run!

You're a blight! Get lost!

By the way,
has Goku not arrived yet?

Regardless of how funny my gag was,
this is no time for laughs.

The fate of Earth is at stake!

Hurry, Son Goku!

I see it!

I'm almost there!

Goku's presence?!

Yeah. He's getting close!
He just might make it in time!

One more hour, huh?

Kakarrot isn't chickening out on us, is he?

It's all or nothing. It looks
like that's all we can do.

He's here! Son Goku is here!

Kami-sama, quickly!

It's the end of the Serpentine Road!

T-That was fast! That was remarkably fast!

Hmm? There's a powerful Ki,
divided into two! What's going on?!

And so, three hours pass
without Goku showing up.

It's time.

Damn!

It appears that waiting
for him didn't do any good.

He's still not here?

No, the coward Kakarrot has not come.

My father is not a coward!

Damn, why isn't he here?!

Son Goku...

Now then, to give them
a thorough working over...

it's too bad we won't be able
to show this to Kakarrot.

There's only once chance for
us to be able to beat this guy.

Of course, that assumes that
everything goes smoothly.

Listen up.

First, Kuririn, you go after him

and draw his attention as much as you can.

Then, I'll find an opening and grab
his tail, the Saiyan's weak spot.

O-Oh, right.

Once he loses his strength,
and can't move anymore,

Gohan, you wring out all the
power you've got and charge him.

Right! I won't run away
this time, so it will be okay.

Of course you won't. Remember that
the fate of Earth is in your hands.

Gohan, have faith in yourself.
If you set your mind to it,

your power is even greater than mine.

All right...!

--Goku!
--Kami-sama!

Hurry! Grab on!

If you please!

T-That kid really did make it back
here from Kaio-sama's place.

Okay, I'm off! My training went great!

--We're counting on you!
--Good luck, Goku!

Mm-hmm!

Guys! Gohan! Please be alive!

Here he comes! Son Goku is quite exhausted!

Hey...!

Karin-sama!

My last two senzu beans! Here!

Thank you!

This really helps!

We're counting on you!

I'll use one right now!

All right, full strength!

Kinto Un!

Long time no see!

You're on!

There's an incredible gathering of Ki!

That way!

All right,

here goes!

Ha! He's leading off by charging right at me!

Draw his attention!

Now!

W-Why, you!

Gohan!

You fool!

I-Impossible...!

P-Piccolo-san!

Whoa, don't go dying, now!

You still have to tell us
about the Dragon Balls.

T-T-This can't be...!

Hell of a miscalculation, huh?

Did you think we would leave
our weakness untrained forever?

That's a shame.

The best fighter on this world,

reduced to this with just one blow!

P-Piccolo-san!

Shake it off!

Now then, while he's gone beddy-bye,

I guess I'll play around with the little ones.

I'll start with Kakarrot's son.

Hey, you carry true Saiyan blood.

You're bound to offer me a little fun, right?

Hey, now, don't go croaking on me yet.
Play with me a little more!

That's the spirit!

You bastard!

Ho... his movements,
at least, are something else.

Let me show you something I've been saving!

Kienzan!!

What a sorry technique!

Nappa! Dodge it!

That idiot! Couldn't he tell
what kind of technique it was?!

Damn...!

W-Why, you...!

How dare you... how dare you cut my face?!

Get out of my sight!

I'll finish you!

You're awake already?

Y-You punk!

Looks like they're giving you trouble, Nappa!

Don't you... don't you
look down on Earth, Saiyan!

Why, you! Now I'm furious!

I was going easy on you, since I can't kill you

because of the Dragon Balls,

and now you've gotten all full of yourself!

You're the one who's full of himself!

W-What is that Ki?!

There's a tremendous Ki
heading here from far away!

I-It's true!

An amazing, yet familiar Ki!

N-No doubt about it... I-I can feel it...

it can only be him! Son Goku!

Just a little farther, Goku. Hurry. Hurry!

It's Son Goku! Son Goku is coming!

I-I just knew he would come!
Damn that punk for keeping us waiting!

F-Father! Father is coming!

Hurry! Hurry!

G-Goku...

These guys have a strange power
by which they can sense presences.

Is it Kakarrot? Let's see...

They're close! I can feel it!

Two huge Ki, and two even more
huge Ki! There's one small Ki!

T-The numbers don't add up!
H-Has somebody died?!

Kinto Un, hurry even faster!

Vegeta,

is what they're saying true?

Is Kakarrot really headed this way?

I don't know if it's Kakarrot or not,

but somebody is going to be
here in about four minutes.

Someone with a battle power of 5,000 !

- 5,000 ?! I-impossible!

Nappa! kill them!

If the four of them team up together,
they could become a problem!

They'll also serve as an example for Kakarrot!

What?!

B-But what about the Dragon Balls?

No matter! I have an idea!

If we go to that Namekian's
home world of Planet Namek,

they're sure to have even more
powerful Dragon Balls there!

I thought it was just a silly story,

but if Kakarrot has really come back to life,

then the legend is true after all!

I get it. All right...

I'll start with you!

P-Piccolo-san! Run!

I'll keep him busy somehow
until Father gets here!

What?!

After all, Piccolo-san, if you die,
then Kami-sama dies, too,

and the Dragon Balls will be...

What kind of nonsense is that?!

There's no way you can
keep him busy all by yourself!

Don't make me laugh! You little brat!

No!

You brat! You're through!

O-Oh, no!

Die!!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Tears Shed by Piccolo... Son Goku's Furious Counterattack!" / "Farewell, Piccolo! Goku's Furious Counterattack!
  

 I'll save you! 

I told you to run... 
Hurry , or else... 

Don't die! 
Father will be here soon, 
and he'll beat them up! 
Please , don't die! 

That fool! 
My kill order has been changed, 
but no matter. 
It's all the same either way. 

O-One of the Ki is growing smaller in a hurry. 
S-Somebody is dying! 

It looks like my life is about to run out... 
G-Goku didn't make it there in time... 
But at the very end, there, 
Piccolo surpassed me, 
as Kami... 
I'm so happy... 

Kami-sama! 

T-This is so pathetic... 
I-Imagine, 
Piccolo Daimao, 
of all people, 
p-Protecting a little kid... 
it's appalling... 

U-Uncle! 

Gohan, you're the only one 
who ever talked to me one-to-one. 

But Father said that after you were reborn, 
Piccolo-san, you don't seem to be as full-blown 
bad as you were before. 
I kind of think so, too. 
My mother and grandfather were 
afraid of you, though. 

That was no fair. 
You said you weren't going to use your eyes. 

Don't be such a baby! 
Do you think a promise like that means anything in a fight?! 

B-But Piccolo-san, you're not the enemy. 

T-This last year with you wasn't so bad... 

Uncle! Don't die now... 

G-Go... han... 

Uncle!! 

Mister Popo, I leave the rest in your hands... 

Kami-sama! Kami-sama! 

This should be good! 

You wanna go at it?!
Masenko!!

His Ki is incredible!
... 1,500 ...
2,800 ...
Battle power 2,800 !
These guys can acutely
alter their battle powers!

2,800 , huh?
That was a pretty 
incredible move, for a little kid!
My arm stings a little.

His battle power is dropping like a stone.
It looks like he used up all
of his power on that one shot.

P-Piccolo-san, I'm sorry.
I was unable to avenge you.

Gohan! Run! Run away!

Kid, I'm sending you into the
next world for sure this time!

I don't even have the strength
to run away anymore.

I can't wait to see
Kakarrot's face when he sees...
...his own son, smashed to a pulp!

K-Kinto Un?!

Father!

Goku!

So, you've finally shown up.

Why have you taken the trouble
to come here, Kakarrot?

Don't tell me you've come
to tell some ridiculous joke

about how you're here to defeat us.

Piccolo...

Piccolo-san died protecting me.

Tenshinhan...

Yamucha...

Are you in shock at seeing all
of your foolish, fallen comrades?

Come to think of it,
there was another little runt,

who got blown to shreds.

He had decent power, despite his tiny size.

So, Chaozu, too...
And Kami-sama, as well. Damn!

No need to grieve for them.
You'll be joining them, soon enough.

Here you've gone and come back to life,

and you just nonchalantly show up here.

His battle power is rising fast.

What? You're ready to die already?

Accept this by way of greeting!

He's fast!

Gohan, this way.

--Kuririn...
--G-Goku...

Sorry I took so long.

I'm impressed you two made it through.

Here. Each of you eat half.

T-That's a senzu bean, isn't it?
Karin-sama still had some?

Mm-hmm. This is the last one.

Then you eat it.

It's all right. I had one before I got here.

No, you hold on to it, just in case.

Even if we recover now, we won't be any help.

Don't worry about it. if you
don't eat it, I'll throw it away.

Here.

Thanks.

Gohan, you, too.

Mm-hmm.

Kuririn, you've improved incredibly,
huh? I can tell by your Ki.

I thought I had, anyhow, but it's no use.

It didn't do any good
against them. They're too strong.

I... I just watched as
everyone else died around me...

Gohan, I barely recognized you, either.

You sure have trained hard.

Mm-hmm. Piccolo-san trained me.
But I wasn't able to do anything.

With Piccolo-san dead, we can
never use the Dragon Balls again.

We can't bring anyone back to life.

Let's all three of us avenge them!
Goku, with you joining in,

we might at least be able to get one of them!

Hey, Goku, you trained under some
terrific guy named "Kaio," right?

Yeah.

But I'm going to fight them by myself.

You guys watch from a distance,

so you don't get caught in the middle of it.

B-By yourself?!

You may be strong, Goku, but that's crazy!

Their strength is far greater
than we can imagine!

H-He's right, Father!

G-Goku...

F-Father!

Let Goku handle this.

B-But...

I've never seen Goku
filled with that much anger.

T-There's no room for us to intrude here.

What's with that face
you're making? I don't like it!

You want me to kill you, just like that?

You're going to pay for this!

F-Father is incredible!

Battle power 7,000 ... 8,000 ...

impossible!

Vegeta, what has Kakarrot's
battle power gone to?

More than 8,000 !

More than 8,000 ?! That must be
some kind of mistake! A malfunction!

Don't you worry. I still won't
use Kaio-ken against you.

Kaio-ken?

Shut up!

There's no way you can stand
up against the great Nappa!

What?!

H-How did he do that just now?

W-When did you get behind me?

W-Why, you...!

For all your swaggering,
you ain't all that great.

W-What did you say?!

I-I'm not all that great?!

That's right. I can tell
from that attack just now.

Why don't you explain to me...

...exactly what it is you can tell?

Strange. it's as though his battle power

is completely different
from when he fought Raditz.

Over here!

D-Did you see your dad move?

Uh-uh. But it was amazing.

How can this be?

How did Kakarrot gain this much
power in such a short time?

That one was for Chaozu!

Damn it!

This is for Yamucha!

Why, you...

...filthy little brat!

Ain't no need for me to even dodge this!

W-What?!

H-He countered it with just a ki-ai shout?

D-Damn you!

This one is for Tenshinhan!

H-How?! How can Kakarrot
have this much power?!

What?!

And this one is for Piccolo!

Damn it!

A-Awesome! You really are awesome, Goku!

Yes!

Damn it all!

I see. You're incredibly tough. I'm impressed.

I am a highborn, elite warrior!

I will not be made sport of by
a lower-class warrior like you!

I'll get you for this! I'll kill you!

You idiot! Cool your jets!

If you think it through rationally,

you'll see he's not an unbeatable opponent!

Nappa, calm down!

Right... Thanks, Vegeta.

Thanks to you, my eyes have been opened.

Tch! Simple-minded fool!

At this rate, I'm going to have to take over.

It's true, all the blood had rushed to my head,

but from here on, I'll show you my true colors.

Are you ready for this, Kakarrot?

That's more like it.
I'm looking forward to this.

Talk tough, will you?

He's not just talking tough.

He possesses assurance
and absolute self-confidence.

G-Goku...

Father...

I see you!

Whoo! This is much better, ain't it?

This is better?

I'm gonna close that insolent
mouth of yours for good!

This will finish you!

What a freak!

He struck back at that close
range in that brief instant!

Whoa, if I had taken that one full-on,
it would have been trouble.

I-Impossible! That was my greatest
technique! You just brushed it aside!

You really are a tough bastard.

The Kamehame-Ha should
have taken at least some toll.

If this keeps up, we ain't getting anywhere.

That's enough! Come on down, Nappa!

You're getting us nowhere!
I'll take care of him!

What?!

You're pathetic!

Imagine, me, actually having
to take action against Kakarrot!

H-He's finally going to start in?

Even the big guy there is intimidated by him.


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

This is the Kaioken! The Critical Battle of Goku vs. Vegeta" 
  

"This is the Kaio-ken!!
The Critical Battle of Goku vs. Vegeta."

D-Damn.

T-To think that I'd have to turn
over your execution to Vegeta.

Orders are orders. I'll let
Vegeta take care of you.

But I can't let it end with
me withdrawing like this.

Crap! The other two!

It's no use! I won't make it in time!

Kaio-ken!!

What?!

Damn...!

He ain't able to fight anymore.

Take him, and get yourselves
off of Earth, right now.

W-What was that just now?

For a moment, his speed
and power shot up sharply!

G-Goku, how did you do that?

Is that a technique you learned
from that Kaio-sama guy?

Yeah. it's called " Kaio-ken."

By controlling all the Ki in your body,
you amplify it momentarily.

If you do it right, your power,
speed, destructive force,

and defensive force all
multiply many times over.

T-That's awesome! As strong as you've become,

you can still become many
times stronger than even that?

--Yeah.
--Goku, you're such a tease!

This is no time to be playing around, right?

If you had that up your sleeve,
you should have used it from the start.

Sorry, I couldn't do that.

If I don't control it while
throttling my Kijust right,

I could really mess myself up.

Basically...

Just to press the point, at your level,

you cannot use the Kaio-ken too heavily.

If your control slips up,
you'll end up damaging your body.

Keep your power down to double,
at the most. Understood?

Performing a Kaio-ken beyond that
will put too great a strain on your body.

Put another way, your body won't
be able to keep up with the Kaio-ken,

and it will end up backfiring on you.

Mm-hmm, I got it.

And that's the story.

O-Oh...

V-Vegeta... h-help me...

T-Thanks...

Hmph, not at all.

W-What are you--

Vegeta! Vegeta!!

I have no need for a Saiyan who can't move!

W-What a Ki!

F-Father!

W-What's going on?!

Die!

V-Vegeta!!

W-W-What a monster!
He even k*lled his own buddy!

Gohan, Kuririn,

the two of you go on back to
the Kame House, right now.

R-Right.

Gohan, you heard him. Hurry, let's go.

B-But...

Gohan, he's too much for us.

We won't be of any help
if we stick around here.

And our being here will just distract Goku,

and make him worry over us.

Really, Father?

Sorry about that.

It looks like his strength
is greater than I thought.

O-Okay, I understand.

Oh, yeah. Goku, as long as you're fighting,

could you do it in another location?

It wouldn't do to let everyone's
bodies here get all messed up,

once we bring them back to life again.

Bring them back to life?

Piccolo is dead, so Kami-sama is dead, too.

The Dragon Balls are now gone forever.

I hate to say it, but they ain't
ever coming back to life.

Yeah, I know that.

K-Kuririn-san, by any chance...

W-What?

I'll explain it all to you later.

That is, if you're able to beat him, Goku.

If I can beat him, huh? Yeah.

I have to beat him, at any rate,

no matter what.

What are you waiting for?

What happened to all that
enthusiasm you had a moment ago?

Have you lost your nerve and
decided to huddle up and run away?

Okay then, well, I guess I'll
change locations, and do my best.

In any case, let me handle this.

Goku, sorry about always having
to leave our fate up to you alone.

Don't you dare go dying now, my good friend.

Yeah.

Father...

Gohan...

...after Daddy comes back home alive,

let's go fishing together or something, okay?

Okay!

It looks like you realize that
there's no use in running away.

We're going to change our battle location.

Suit yourself. it will all turn out the same.

Father...

I should have known as much.

He's following with confidence to spare.

Gohan...

Hey, Gohan!

--Yes?
--Let's hurry back to the Kame House.

Mm-hmm.

Let's stop worrying. We've turned
over the fate of the Earth to him.

It'll be all right, Gohan.
Goku is sure to take care of him.

Now, let's go. Hurry back and show
your mother that you're all right.

Right!

Here should be all right. There ain't
any people or animals around.

I see...

So this is the place you've
chosen to be your grave, is it?

You should rejoice.

After all, a lower-class warrior like you

is going to get toyed around
with by a super-elite.

Soon after Saiyans are born, their
capabilities as soldiers are tested.

The scum whose ratings are low

are then sent to worlds without
tough opponents, like you were.

In other words...

...you were an outcast!

And as a result, I was able
to come here to Earth.

I should be grateful. Besides...

...maybe even an outcast can surpass an elite

if he tries desperately enough.

That's a pretty good joke.

Well then, let me show you a wall

that you will never be able
to get over with effort alone!

What's the matter, Kakarrot?!
You can do better than that, can't you?!

You were giving more than
this when you beat Nappa!

Let me see it!

Impressive. He ain't even
taking this seriously yet,

but his speed and technique
are already beyond mine.

Show me, unless you've already
used up all your strength.

All right! I'll show you!

Kaio-ken!!

If that was the limit of what you've got,

I'm going to be very disappointed.

What a brute this guy is...

But then...

...for as much trouble as I'm in
right now, I'm starting to get excited.

He's laughing? Has he given
up hope, and turned defiant?

Or does he know he is capable of
raising his battle power even higher?

Well?! Are you done already?!

That appears to be all you've got.

Well then, allow me to show
you something before you die...

The overwhelming power
of a super-elite Saiyan!

That disagreeable grin of yours is
going to be wiped away soon enough.

What a Ki! it's as if the
entire Earth is trembling!

It's a full-on typhoon!

The air has stopped quivering.

A-All of the clouds have been blown away.

It's over, Kakarrot.

You fool! Behind you!

Kaio-ken, times two!!

All right, nicely dodged.

I made that one easy for you to dodge.

It wouldn't be any fun if you died too easily.

Damn, what power and speed he has!

Not even my times-two Kaio-ken
can keep up with him.

Ain't much else I can do, huh?

This may wreck my body,
but it's better than dying.

I ain't got any choice but to raise
my Kaio-ken to triple-strength.

I've already come so close,

so there's no point in not checkin'
them out, and what do I see?

That punk and Goku're both so strong,

it's like I'm havin' a nightmare.

Now then, once I raise my
Kaio-ken to times-three,

I wonder how long my body
will be able to hold out.

What's the matter, Kakarrot? Come and get me!

Either way, I've got no choice but to do it.

The way things are going,
there ain't any way I can win.

Don't you have anything else up your sleeve?

Looks like you messed with the wrong guy.

Even among the other Saiyans,
I was the most powerful man around.

No matter how much you may have trained,

you're still just an outcast!

You've only put off the time of
your defeat by a few moments.

This ain't good.

That Saiyan bastard has him
completely overpowered.

Maybe I'd better get outta here while I can.

Uh-huh, I oughtta beat it.

It don't do no good for me to be here, nope.

May my body withstand this!
Times-three Kaio-ken!!

N-No! You can't exceed
double-strength, Son Goku!

Then again, as it stands,
there's definitely no way he can win.

Imagine, that guy being so strong...

This battle... may be hopeless.

W-What's wrong?

H-Has something happened?

It's probably Son-kun,
but this battle power reading

I-Is rising like crazy!

--Goku!
--Goku-sa!

17,000 ... 19,000 ... 21,000 ...

O-Oh, no...

W-What?!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

The Impact of the Kamehameha! Vegeta's Tenacious Transformation"
  

Times-three Kaio-ken!!

Awesome, man...

Why, you...!

Y-You miserable...!

H-He's got 'im! He just might win this!

I-Impossible! How can his...

How can Kakarrot's battle
power be greater than mine?

D-D-Damn, this guy is tough.
I have to settle this quick, or else...

S-shoot, my body...

I-I'm not going to let this happen!

I am a super-elite!

There's no way I'll be beaten
by that lower-class warrior!

I am the best in the universe!

S-Sure enough, it looks like using a
triple Kaio-ken is too much for me.

If this drags out too long,
I'm the one who will be done in first.

Blood!

My noble blood has been
spilled by that piece of trash?!

I-I won't allow it! No way... No way will I allow it!

Who needs this planet anymore?!

I'm going to blow you and
all of Earth into tiny pieces!

You're gonna what?!

Go ahead and dodge this if you can!

You might save yourself,
but Earth will be blown to pieces!

Damn, he thought this through!

I'll have to risk it!

A triple-Kaio-ken...

...Kamehame-ha!

Ka... me...

...ha...

There's no way you can stop my Gyallic-Ho!

...me...

I'll turn you and the whole Earth into space dust!

...ha!!

W-What?! It's just like my Gyallic-Ho!

Kaio-ken...

...times four!

I-It's pushing me back--

H-H-He did it! He did it!

Son! Ya did it, you magnificent bastard!

Yajirobe? What are you doing here?

What, you didn't notice?

For as strong as even you are,
you sure did bust yer tail there, huh?

--Yeah, I guess.
--But then, way to send that awesome dude flyin'!

You sure are one helluva stud, there.

W-What? What'sa matter?

I-I used a technique that was
too much for my body to take.

Oh, yeah? Well, it wasn't
nothin' normal, that's fer sure.

Never mind me, Yajirobe,
you should get out of here.

What for?

Y-You don't mean...

He's still alive. if that's all it
took to kill him, it'd be too easy.

B-But it's no sweat, right?
You're the stronger one.

I told you, I overdid it,
and now my body is falling apart.

I might be just about maxed out.

I-Is that right?

Well, then...

G-Good luck with that!

D-Damn it!

How?! How can Kakarrot's battle
power be greater than mine?!

Damn it all! I am a Saiyan!

I am the strongest one in the entire world!

At this point, as much as I hate how ugly it is,

it's time for my last resort--

to transform into a Great Ape, and crush him!

My strength as a Great Ape is overwhelming!

Damn it, I chose to arrive here
on the day of the full moon

so that we could wipe out the
people of this planet quickly,

but I never thought I'd have to
transform just to defeat Kakarrot!

This really burns me up!

That's strange. it's well past time
that the moon should be visible.

Saiyan, no matter how hard
you look, it won't do any good.

The moon isn't there.

That Piccolo fellow was afraid
something like this might happen,

and got rid of it long ago.

Still, Goku can't have very much strength left.

Even if the Saiyan doesn't
transform into a Great Ape,

it doesn't change the fact that he's in trouble.

But then, he's growing weaker, too.

The Genki Dama! If you can
hit him with a Genki Dama,

you'll beat him for sure!

That's weird. He's just hovering around up there.

Why doesn't he come down after me?

It's gone! it's gone! it's gone! Damn it!

The moon isn't anywhere! How can this be?!

I get it. Damn it! That bastard
is driving me right up the wall!

Kakarrot took out the moon
before we even got started!

Now I've got no choice.

My battle power might drop a little bit,

but it doesn't look like I've got any other option.

Ha, I can't wait to see the
look of panic on his face!

He's finally coming back down.

The only way for me to beat
him is with a Genki Dama.

Will I be able to focus enough?

Kakarrot!

You may have thought you were
clever, getting rid of the moon,

but it's not going to work!

The moon? What do you mean?

And now you're playing dumb.

Do you know why it is that
we are able to transform

when we look at a full moon?

Transform?

The light of the moon is that
which is reflected from the sun.

It is only when sunlight is
bounced back by the moon

that it contains Bruits waves.

When the moon is full,

those Bruits waves exceed
a value of million zenoes.

What is this guy talking about?

Once at least million zenoes of
Bruits waves are absorbed by the eyes,

the tail responds to it...

...and the transformation begins!

There are a limited number of Saiyans

that can artificially create a full moon

that produces more than million zenoes.

Your gambit won't play out!
Despite getting rid of the moon,

when the oxygen of this planet
mixes with my Power Ball...

Sorry to keep you waiting, Kakarrot.

Your death is finally at hand!

A lower-class warrior shouldn't have challenged

a super-elite like me to battle, anyhow!

The moment he produced that
strange light, his Ki dropped.

What is he planning to do,
that he would go that far?

What?!

Burst open and intermix!

W-What...

...is that? What have you done?!

Y-You don't mean...

H-He created a moon!

You're going to regret having
lost your tail, Kakarrot!

'Ulp!

Is this the end?

W-What is that?

H-Hey, over there...

T-That's the direction we just came from.

What could it be? it's awfully bright.

T-This is impossible!

W-What is that? There's a tremendous Ki rising.

Father's Ki hasn't gone up again, has it?

N-No, this icky feeling is from the other guy.

And I have to say, his Ki is really something else.

What's going on?

F-Father...

Gohan...

I-I'm going back there.

I'm going back.

G-Going back? You mean, to where Goku is?

I-I just know that Father is in danger,

and he's going to die if I don't do something.

What are you talking about, Gohan? Goku isn't--

There's no way your father
is going to die, you know.

For one thing, even if we do go back,

against a guy with a Ki like that...

Yes, I know...

Still...

I have to go! I'm sure of it!

H-Hey!

Wait up, Gohan!

What do you say, Kakarrot?

You're finished now!

W-What is going on here?!

A-A Great Ape? A Great Ape monster?!

I'm going to let you in on a little something.

The battle power of a Saiyan
in his Great Ape form

is ten times greater than before!

Goku, on the night of the full moon,

a giant ape monster appears.
You must not go outside then.

If you're asleep, you'll be safe.

I will fix it so that your tail never grows back.

It seems to be something of a nuisance, after all.

So that's it. I finally understand.

H-How can that be?

The monster that stomped Grandpa to death...

...and appeared at the tournament
grounds, smashing them up...

...w-was me?

Forgive me, Grandpa.

This guy is ridiculously powerful.

Unless I use up all of my Ki, I doubt
I have a chance of beating him.

Once I die, and go back over to the Next World,

I'll come and apologize to you.

I'll show you, Vegeta!

I'm gonna cram a Genki Dama
from me and the Earth

right down your throat!

F-Father!

Goku... He's your son, all right.

K-Kaio-ken!

What's the matter?!

Can't you even run away?

Die!

What's the matter, Kakarrot?
Can't you deal with this?

A-As huge as he is, he's so fast!

There ain't enough time for me
to focus to create a Genki Dama!

Not even a times-five Kaio-ken
would work against him!

Hmph, you're not going to come at me?

In that case, I'll go after you!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Goku in Absolute Peril! Entrust Your Wishes to the Genki Dama"   


T-That's it!

Tenshinhan! I have to borrow your move!

Taiyo-ken!!

Now, while the brightness has blinded his eyes...

M-My eyes! My eyes!

A-All right. With this much distance...

T-The Land...

...the Seas...

...and... all living things...

Each of you, share with me just
a little bit of your genki energy!

I beg you!

Damn it! What an insolent thing to do!

A-A little more... a little more,
and I can create a Genki Dama...

W-What's he doin'?

He's starting to get his sight back.

Still, at this distance,

I'll be able to launch my
Genki Dama before he can attack.

Damn it, where are you?!

Where are you?!

Where did you go?!

It's no use trying to escape!
I can sense your presence!

The genki energy is collecting!

Why, you...!

He found me! Please, let there be enough time!

I-It's done! I've collected the
genki energy of the whole Earth!

--All right!
--Take this!

W-What was that?

What happened?

I-I never expected him to attack like that...

I-I really misjudged things...

Good grief, the Genki Dama I worked
so hard to make is now gone.

Hmph, you're one tough bastard.

But then, you look like you've
almost had it. I can tell.

He's got me. Now, I ain't even
got a prayer of beating him.

I used up nearly all of my Ki
on that Genki Dama just now.

Well, what will you do now?!

Goku's Ki is falling off, fast!

F-Father!

Hurry! We're almost there!

Whoops! Sorry, sorry!

Looks like I accidentally stepped
on you, crushing your leg.

Well, this time, let me
accidentally crush your heart!

This is the end for you, Kakarrot!

Even if you come back to life again,
this planet won't be here when you do!

D-Damn it, he's completely beaten me.

I never imagined there'd be
such a gap in power between us.

I'm glad there's someone this strong out there,

but if I'm dead, it's just frustrating...

Hmph, die!

That's my last, parting shot...

I-I ain't even got enough strength
left to blow my nose now...

D-Do what you will with me...

Why, you!

Kakarrot, how dare you...

How dare you scar my face?!

I'm going to squeeze you to death!

He's in a tight spot! it's no use now, he's dead!

It ain't like I've abandoned you, okay?

T-There's nothin' I can do, after all.

Don't go holdin' it against me.

Suffer good and hard, then die!

We're close! They're right over there!

Because of that weird ball of light,

it's still this bright out,
even though it's the evening.

What in the world is that thing?

K-Kuririn-san! Over there!

Get down, Gohan! Descend, and hide!

W-What is that?

Hurry, you dumb-ass!

I-It's those guys!

It can't be! He's turned into a Great Ape!

It felt like most of your bones broke just now.

Does it hurt? Eh?

Goku is getting k*lled. This is bad!

--This way!
--Right!

--Hey!
--Yajirobe!

Hey, who d'ya think that
monster is?! it's the Saiyan!

I know.

There ain't no way you can go up
against that monster! Stay put!

I know that, too.

But if we cut off his tail, he'll go back to normal.

--His tail?
--His tail?

Listen, Gohan, you and Yajirobe
swing around in front of him,

and draw his attention.

I'll wait for an opening,
and cut off his tail from behind.

Hurry! Goku is gonna die!

R-Right!

H-He's gotta be kiddin' me! Draw his attention?

You guys might not know 'bout this,

but even at his normal size,
he's still unbelievably strong!

Father, don't die!

Goku's Ki is all but gone!
Damn it, he's about to die!

Father! Don't die!

There's someone there!

--Where are you?!
--Down here!

Let my father go!

Ho ho, this is a surprise. if it isn't Kakarrot's kid!

I get it, you came here just to see
your father's last moments, huh?

Good timing! He's right at the point of death.

I was just about to finish him off.

Kienzan!!

Watch closely, now.

I'm going to crush him until there's nothing left.

Kuririn-san, hurry!

Unfortunately, it looks like
he's already lost consciousness.

I-I-It can't be...!

Did you really think I wouldn't realize

that there was another one of you here?

You guys seem to enjoy
worthless sentimentality, after all.

I figured this kid wouldn't just
come wandering back here alone,

so I was keeping an eye on the situation.

Apparently, you knew about
our tails. Too bad, though.

Just you wait! After I'm finished
with Kakarrot, you'll be next.

D-Damn! What a freak! Even as a monster,

he's still level-headed, and on guard.

I'm sorry Goku. I hate to just
stand by and let you die,

but this guy's Ki is too great.
I can't even get close!

Your mistake was to try
to challenge me to battle!

Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

Stop it!

Oh, you want to die before your father, do you?

O-Oh, no!

What's the matter? Too scared to move?

Leave me outta the rest of it!

D-Damn it! I-l didn't know
there was another one of you!

M-My tail!

I-It's cut... His tail has been cut off!

You did it, Yajirobe!
He's gone back to his original size!

W-Why, you miserable...!

You want to die so badly, you'd make me mad?!

W-What's going on? Why did that monster...?

In that case, as you wish, I'll k*ll you, you trash!

Gohan! Run!

I'll start with you!

A Saiyan half-breed is strong, right?!

Show me your true power!

Heh, maybe there's been a change in the order.

Now, get up! Amuse me a little more.

Hey, what is this? Is this all you've got?

Does that mean the child
of scum is scum, as well?!

You may be scum, but at
least your blood is still red.

Want me to at least let you
die next to your father?

I can be gracious.

Here!

G-Gohan...

Ho, Kakarrot, you're a tough one.
You're still conscious, are you?

Gohan, Daddy's all busted up on the inside...

I-I can't move...

Y-You have to fight in my place...

His power has to have been
reduced significantly...

I-I can't, Father.

H-He's too strong. I can't beat him.

All right, this is the order I'll go in:

First, I'll k*ll Kakarrot. Next, Kakarrot's kid.

After him, I'll finish off that
bald-headed bastard from earlier.

And lastly, the one that cut off my precious tail!

He remembered 'bout me!

Y-You don't have to beat him...
J-Just keep him at bay...

Your power should be much
better than this... much better...

And then, I'll have Kuririn finish him off...

I can't do it. I can't move anymore, either.

You jackass! Do you want everyone
else's death to be in vain?!

What did Piccolo teach you?!

I'm counting on you, Gohan...

G-Gohan...

Give me trouble, will you?!

You're nothing but outcast scum!

S-Stop... that...

Stop that!

What?

I'm going to...

...defeat you!

Hmph, you are going to defeat me?

What?!

Kuririn! Kuririn, please! Come here!

Damn it...

Don't you mess around with Vegeta!

Goku, this is impossible. He's just too strong.

Why didn't you tell Gohan to run away?

K-Kuririn, I'm going to give
you this, before it's too late...

The Genki Dama I've collected
from the whole Earth...

W-What did you say? What are you giving me?

A G-Genki Dama. A little Ki I've
gathered from all over the earth...

About half of it has gotten away,

but the way he is now, I still
think it's enough to defeat him...

W-What?

Kuririn, hold onto my hand...

I-I don't understand any of this.

Hurry! Gohan is gonna die!

Y-You just want me to hold onto your hand?

Please...

Like this?

Your arm is broken, isn't it?!

Just like that. Don't let go.

I'm giving it to you... Take it...

W-W-What is this?

I-I-It's incredible! it's an incredible amount of Ki!

T-Take it, and focus it above
your palm... it will create a ball...

You filthy brat!

Hang in there... Gohan ain't
able to control this kind of Ki...

T-There it is! This is a...

...Genki Dama. Y-You did it...

Pesky brat!

Kuririn... hit him with it...
I can't make another Genki Dama...

Y-You've got to make sure you hit him... Please...

A-All right. I'll try.

Once you realized that, it was already too late! 

Feel out the evil of his Ki, then launch. 

I get it. 

Kuririn... I'm counting on you... 
You will only get one chance with this. 

I'm through playing around. 
Can you get away from this?! 

F-Feel it! Feel the evil of his Ki! 

He's fixin' to do somethin', huh? 
That's a huge wad of Ki. 
Well, if yer gonna do it, do it already! 

Watch this closely, Kakarrot! 
This is the end of your foolish son! 

I've got it! 

What're ya doin', dumb-ass?! 
Hurry up an' chuck that thing! 

That idiot! 
Damn it all! 

W-What is that?! 

Hit him! 
It missed!

It's hopeless now!

Bounce it back, Gohan!

Gohan, that thing is friendly fire!

If you ain't got any evil in you,
you should be able to repel it!

They did it!

Yahoo!

We did it!

We did it! We did it, Goku!

Thank goodness! Goku!
We did it! We did it! We did it!

You guys finally did it, huh?

Mm-hmm.

I thought we'd had it, time and again, there.

You guys have both been run ragged.

Not as badly as you've been.

T-The Saiyan...

it's okay. He's dead.

Damn you. You were one hell of a beast,

but I guess we should at least dig a grave.

You mean a grave for yourselves?!

T-T-That's impossible! He took
that Genki Dama dead-on!

You've gone and done quite a number on me.

Even I thought I was going to die from that one.

I-I've taken a considerable amount of damage,

but I still have enough strength
to take care of trash like you.

Once I've killed you all,
I'll wait and recover my strength,

then completely destroy this planet!

Y-You've made me, Vegeta, use up
nearly the full limit of my power.

And though it may have taken
a number of you to do it,

it wounds my pride that
trash like you have done this.

Would you people drop dead already?!

D-Damn it... Damn it...!

G-Goku!

D-Damn it, I have to admit,
that destructive force was pathetic.

All three of them are still clinging to life.

T-The damage was worse than I thought...

I-I have to hurry up and take care of these guys...

...and then get some rest...

T-The little brat!

His tail has grown back!

H-His tail? Oh, yeah.

Way back when, Goku's tail
also grew back all of a sudden.

Oh, crap!

If he were to transform
on me, it would be trouble.

W-What?!

I done it! I done it!

Serves ya right, you jackass!

Nyah-hah-hah-hah!

How d'ya like that?! Yer no match
for Yajirobe! Nyah-hah-hah!

Why, you...

You filthy bastard!

S-S-Sorry! Did that hurt? I-l was
just kiddin' around! Did I cut ya?

Yeah! I got lotsa respect for you.
L-Let's you an' I be buds--

Y-Yajirobe...

Nobody, and I mean nobody
wounds me and gets away with it!

D-Damn it...

G-Gohan!

Gohan!

T-That's Father's voice...

G-Gohan, listen to me...

Mm-hmm...

Look at the ball of light in the sky...

B-Ball of light...? Ball of light...?

O-Oh, no! I won't let that happen!

Die!

Oh, crap!

Y-You little brat! I'm not
about to let you grow huge!

Damn!

I have to kill him, now, while I can!

G-Gohan, it's up to you...!

G-Gohan is turning Great Ape...
it's an all-or-nothing gamble...

T-That's right, his tail!

I was in such a rush, I forgot
the most important thing!

If I can just cut off his tail...

Gohan...

Then again,

when Goku became a Great Ape,
he had no trace of rationality.

What about Gohan...?

Gohan is the same way!

R-Right, it's not so much that
Goku and Gohan lose their rationality,

as it is that when they turn Great Ape,

they revert to being violent Saiyans!

Wah! Stay away!

Gohan!

G-Gohan!

G-Gohan! The Saiyan!

Get the Saiyan!

W-Why, that...

Gohan!

Good! A small part of Gohan's
mind still remains in there.

S-Sure, he's half earthling, after all.

The moon I created won't
go out for another hour.

Sure enough, my only choice is to cut off his tail!

D-Damn! My power...!

Damn it!

I can't move!

W-What happened?

Did he get him?

H-He's still alive?

What is that?

There it is...

To think that I'd have to retreat...

D-Damn it, I, Vegeta,

said to be the mightiest
warrior in the universe...

T-That's his spaceship.

Like hell you're getting away!

We've come this far...

Now I'm gonna finish the job.

Hold it!

This is for everyone you've killed!

Say your prayers!

Damn it, my body won't respond...!



Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Dawn of the Fierce Battle... The Star of Hope Is Piccolo's Homeland
  

You've outdone yourselves to come this far.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out.

I'm not supposed to take sides,

but that Saiyan was a villain

who plunged the whole universe into terror.

I couldn't help it.

This doesn't mean that the root of this evil

has been completely eliminated, though.

Not the root of it.

Die!!

Wait!

G-Goku?

W-Was that you who just
spoke inside my mind, Goku?

Yeah, that's right. I can't talk very loud, after all.

K-Kuririn, forgive me for asking,
but would you let him live?

A-Are you out of your mind, Goku?
This guy killed our friends,

and was going to kill everyone in the world!

If we let him go now,
he's sure to recover his strength,

and then come back here!

Y-You're probably right.

If you're thinking that maybe
he'll have a change of heart,

the way Piccolo did,
then you're greatly mistaken!

He's not like that!

I-I know. I know how ridiculously
strong that Vegeta guy is, too.

Still, although I ain't able to explain it too well,

s-seeing him there,
about to die, made me think...

"What a waste."

W-What a waste?

A-After training at Kaio-sama's place,

I thought I had reached my peak.

B-But that Vegeta guy there
had far surpassed me.

It surprised me. To be honest,
I was overwhelmed.

But then, somewhere in my heart,
I was happy and excited.

Must be because I'm a Saiyan, too.

Whenever I see anyone strong, my heart leaps.

I know this is wrong, but please...

...give me another chance to fight him.

All right. You do have the right
to ask for your own way.

It's because of you, Goku, that we
still have the Earth that we do.

But you listen to me, Goku!

You take care of him next time
with devastating power!

Yeah... I'll be sure to...

Remember this well, you trash.

There won't be any more miracles.

The next time we meet, I'll kill you all...

You can look forward to that.

Damn it...

Are you okay?

You can rest easy, now.

He left, eh?

I gotta wonder, why didn't that peabrain...

...finish the guy off?

Sorry about that, Kuririn.

Don't worry about it.

It didn't seem right doing
that to everyone who died,

but then again, it just might be
possible to bring them back to--

H-He couldn't be...!

Hey! Hey!

Gohan-chan!

Ch-Chichi?

Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

Gohan-chan!

Ch-Chichi...

Gohan-chan!

Huh...?

Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan! Are you okay?

Wake up! Your ma is here!

Gohan-chan! What an awful
mess you've been through!

G-Gohan is fine.

Goku is in far worse shape than he is.
You see? You see? Over there.

You poor thing, bein' forced to go through this!

You're never leavin' your ma's side again!

You poor thing! Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

That's just not right.
Goku had a rough time of it, too.

S-Son-kun...

--Goku...
--Son-kun...

Are you okay, Son-kun?

T-This is brutal.

S-Sorry, I let the Saiyan get away.

Oh, no, just being able to drive
him off is quite an accomplishment.

Karin-sama...

C-Calling him strong doesn't begin to cover it.

B-Bulma-san... Yamucha-san
and everyone else besides us four

were k*lled...

Mm-hmm, we were watching it on  TV.

B-But with Piccolo dead, Kami-sama is also...

That's right. Which means,
the Dragon Balls, as well...

I know that much!

You knew, didn't you?

Y-Yeah.

If only Piccolo were one
of the ones who survived...

Well, excuse me fer livin'.

That's right! All you did was run
around! You didn't fight one bit!

W-What was that, ya big--

A good-for-nothing jerk like you
ought to just die right now,

and take Piccolo's place, you idiot!!

If it wasn't fer me, these guys
wouldn'a survived, neither!

Yer really burnin' me up!
No more Mr. Nice Guy fer me!

All right, all right!

Forget about that, we have to hurry
and get the injured to a hospital.

I don't have any more senzu beans left.

Easy, easy... easy, now...

Gohan-chan...

The others' bodies are around here, right?

Um... a little farther that way.

Bulma-san, don't cry. T-The chances
of this might be extremely slim...

...and maybe a little bit ridiculous...

...so listen, but don't get your hopes up.

There is a chance that those
who were killed by the Saiyans

can be brought back to life again.

W-What do you mean?

Really?

It's kind of a nebulous idea...

K-Kuririn, now that you mention it,

you said something about that to me, too.

What do you mean by it? Tell us.

T-The truth is...

H-Hold on a minute. I'll tell you later.

Muten Roshi-sama, land here.

We have to get everyone's bodies aboard.

Mm-hmm.

Over the Star

Taking wing

like a shooting star across the sky

Watching over you from here

T-There isn't one.

He blew himself up, into little pieces.

Spanning the distance

Good grief, how awful.

Let my prayer find its way to you

I really do wish we could
bring them all back to life.

You're the Star

The way things stand, their
sacrifice has been too great.

You can see the blue earth, can't you?

Karin-sama, all I feel is anger...

...over my own powerlessness.

Calling to you, far away, from the heart

transcending time

Let my prayer find its way to you

Let my prayer reach the skies

O-Okay.

Gohan-chan, are you awake?!

Relax! it's Ma! it's your ma!

M-Mother?

You poor thing! What a terrifyin' ordeal!

But you're all right now!

Yes, well done. Outstanding!

We made it through!

How? Where's the Saiyan?

He ran away. He got away from us.

B-But then, we all gave him
a real thrashing, right?

He might not ever come back.

Where's Father?!

I'm in the back, Gohan.

I somehow managed to survive,
thanks to you guys.

Hey, that's all fine an' all...

...but yer Goku's wife, right?
Quit just worryin' 'bout the kid,

an' start lookin' after yer husband some.

H-How rude! No way!

It's because of Goku-sa that
Gohan-chan suffered so!

There was no reason to drag my boy into this!

That's not true, Mother. Father was--

I am far more worried about Gohan-chan's future

than I am worried about the Earth!

Goku, is it okay if I slug her?

Kuririn, would you tell us
about what you meant earlier?

O-Oh, right. Mm-hmm.

The Saiyans seemed to know that
there were Dragon Balls here on Earth,

probably through Goku's brother's radio.

They also knew they granted wishes.

So, as long as they were here,

they were going to obtain the Dragon Balls, too.

--Really?
--Yeah.

But when they saw Piccolo's face,
they said something strange--

that he was a "Namekian."

Apparently, Piccolo was an alien.
And Kami-sama, too, I guess.

That ain't so surprisin', given his face.

The critical thing is what came next.

Nappa! kill them!

B-But what about the Dragon Balls?

No matter! I have an idea!

If we go to that Namekian's
home world of Planet Namek,

they're sure to have even more
powerful Dragon Balls there!

Feh, that's what they said? Big whoop.

I heard them, too!

They said the Namekians had the
power to create mysterious balls.

If-- and that's a really big if--

we were able to go to this Planet Namek,

we might be able to get our
hands on those Dragon Balls.

I get it.

If you did that, those who were
killed could come back to life!

Piccolo-san could come back to life!

G-Gohan-chan! How can you say that?!

Exactly! If Piccolo came back
to life, so would Kami-sama!

Which would also mean the
Dragon Balls here could come back!

--Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!...
--T-That's amazing! T-Then maybe,
possibly, this could work!

Couldn't it? Couldn't it? Couldn't it?

Things are so simple to you laymen, huh?

There's no way we could
achieve such a pipe dream.

What a bummer.

Not even you can do it, Bulma-san?

For one thing, Kuririn,
how are we going to find out

where this whatever-it's-called planet is?

L-Leave that to me.

Kaio-sama, you heard, right?

Do you know where this Planet Namek is?

Planet Namek? Of course I know where it is.

Whatever else anyone says, I am Kaio, after all.

T-This is incredible! We can all hear him, too!

S-So this is Kaio-sama, is it?

Kaio-sama, it sounds like
everyone else can hear you, too.

Tell us where it is.

Hmm, Planet Namek's location...

The way you folks on Earth
would put it... let's see...

Bearing SW by... no, er...

...let's see here... bearing SU ...

...by, let's see, YX, is it?

... YX, you say?!

B-Bulma-san, did you understand that just now?

H-Hey, Kame-chan, take over.
I have to calculate something.

K-Kame-chan?

The thing is, Planet Namek was
once an extremely beautiful world,

but as I recall, a good while back,

they had an awful climatic aberration,

and I thought that all of the Namekians died out.

Then that does it. Ain't no way
there's any Dragon Balls.

H-Hey, you!

Now, don't panic. Once I check up
on Planet Namek, I'll know for sure.

Where was it, again? Let's see now...

Oh, this way?

It makes sense. So Kami-- I mean,
the Namekian who would become Kami--

escaped there and came to Earth.

The fact that Kami himself forgot about it

means that he either lost his memory,

or that he was just a little child at the time.

Either way, he had a sad past.

Even so, the Dragon Balls
can grant any wish, right?

So the guys that made 'em coulda just said,

"Stop this abnormal climate," couldn't they?

That probably wouldn't have worked.

Shen Long said that he couldn't grant any wish

that was greater than the power of
the one who created the Dragon Balls.

That means he couldn't
rein in such terrific power.

That's why even Shen Long couldn't
do anything about the Saiyans.

Oh, ya don't say. The Dragon Balls
ain't all that great, then.

You've got a smart mouth!

Oh, there they are!

There are Namekians! There are
no more than a hundred of them,

but they survived, and are flourishing again!

There're a hundred of them guys?!

Not to worry. By nature,
Namekians are a very gentle race.

Just like the guy that used
to be Kami on your planet.

What became Piccolo Daimao
was probably brought about

by the influence of the evil
in earthlings he encountered

before he became Kami.

Yeah, that tracks.

There're some pretty small-minded
folks out there in the world.

Look who's talking.

Still, this means there's a chance that Kami,

not to mention Yamucha and
Tenshinhan, can come back to life!

--Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
--Naive! You guys are so naive!

Sure, we may know where this
Planet Namek place is. However,

how are you thinking of getting there?

How? Well, in a spaceship, of course.

And I'm telling you, that's where
you're being downright naive!

I just calculated the time it
would take for a spaceship,

using the world's best engine, built by my dad,

to arrive at Planet Namek, just to see what it was.

A real whopper of a number came back. See?

, years and three months.
We'll have to live an awfully long time.

As far as that goes, I think we'll be all right.

I was thinking of using the
spaceship that Saiyan came in.

I got a look at Vegeta's spaceship,

and it was so small, any way
you look at it, it's a one-seater.

Which means that the other,
dead Saiyan's spaceship

has to still be out there somewhere.

Y-Yeah! The spaceship my
older brother rode here in, too!

Ah, come to think of it, that one
got smashed up by Gohan.

Even so, there's still one of them, right?

Once I find that one and analyze it,

I might be able to manage something.

It's probably somewhere around Metro East.

That was the first area destroyed by the Saiyans.

We'll have to go look for it later.

That's what I was thinking,
and picked up a neat little item.

This. I know I saw Vegeta beep this

and call his spaceship in.
I'm sure it's a remote control!

This could work! This could really work!

All right! All right! Hope is in sight!

Planet Namek or bust!

Yeah, right!



Dragon Ball Z Kai 

The Spaceship that Sleeps in Yunzabit! Blast Off for Planet Namek"
  


"Son Goku"
"Son Gohan"

Man, we sure were lucky, huh?

They say that Gohan and I
need to stay here for three days,

and then we'll be good as new.

Ooh, you've got me beat.

They told me it would take four
months for my injuries to heal.

They also said I might not
ever be back to normal again.

Hey, you've got nothing to worry about.

In another month or so, some
new senzu beans will be ready.

You know, you look just like a mummy.

And after the punishin' I took,
they ain't even admittin' me.

Yeah, when Yajirobe was about
to get pounded by that Saiyan,

he was all like, "I'm sorry!

I really respect you! Let's be friends!"

Why, you! I'll knock yer block off!

I just did that to get him off guard!

Anyway, you all really did good.

Nothin' could make me happier.

Plus, it looks like the ones who
died will be comin' back to life.

Hey, guys, guys, the  TV! Look at the  TV!

Oh, it's you, Bulma.

I thought you might have
been a funny-looking nurse.

You just hush! Here, watch the TV.

This object, which was discovered
in the devastation of Metro East,

appears to be a vehicle from space,

though that cannot be confirmed.

That's it! That's the Saiyan's!

--I know, right?
--I-I can't see!

Reports are that at the time
of the discovery of this object,

there were apparently two of them,

but one of them suddenly
flew away from the site.

This isn't good. Those scientists
have already carried it away.

This will be fun, won't it?

Let's use the remote control
that Kuririn brought along

and call that thing over here.

I'm sure it will surprise them.

Are you sure that's a good idea?

What are you talking about? I'm a genius.

I spent last night examining
this thing. Watch this!

Okay, beep, beep, beep...

Ready? Here it goes...

I wanna see, too!

T-The object has suddenly exploded!
What could have happened?

There is wreckage from the object
scattered all over the place!

W-Why?

Could that have been the self-destruct button?!

What do we do?! Without that spaceship,

we can't go to Planet Namek!

Our last hope...

...completely wiped out.

It's hopeless now.

This is what happens when you
find strange remote controls!

Bulma-san, you're the one who
pushed the buttons indiscriminately.

Hey.

Hi.

Mister Popo!

Somebody come with me. There is spaceship.

A spaceship? For real, Popo-san?

Probably.

W-Who is that?

That's Mister Popo.

Mister Popo?

He stays with Kami-sama up at his place.

But he's been up there at Kami's palace

much, much longer than the current Kami-sama.

Say, what do you mean, "probably"?

It probably...

...spaceship. But Mister Popo not quite sure.

Somebody come along, examine it.
Mister Popo lead way.

Bulma-san!

Me?!

Well, Bulma-san, nobody else here
knows anything about spaceships.

Bulma-san?

A-Are you sure this guy is all right?

Isn't there something dodgy about his eyes?

E-Easy...

We're counting on you, Bulma.

Be careful with me as we go, now.

Okay, we go.

Gently... gently, now...

Here we are.

Huh? Already?

Get off.

Where is this place? it's pretty cold here.

Yunzabit Highlands.

Yunzabit?!

That's the other side of the Earth, you know!

We came all the way here in that one instant?

Where was it...?

This way?

J-Just a minute!

Hey, you mean there's something
like a spaceship around here?

Hey, are you listening to me?

You haven't brought me
to this godforsaken place

in order to do something pervy with me, right?

--H-Hey!
--Come quick.

Y-You're kidding, right? I can't do that--

Geez...

This.

Is this spaceship?

I'll have to look closer.

W-What is this? it's not metal. Is this...

Hey, what's going on here?
Tell me what on earth this thing is.

About years ago, Kami-sama
told Mister Popo about past.

When Kami-sama was child,
lived here in Yunzabit.

Mister Popo asked him,

"Yunzabit is remote land. Nobody live there.

Why you live in that place?"

I don't know why I was in that place.

Apparently, I bumped my head,

and all of my memories up until then were lost.

Had no parents?

No, I didn't. The only thing
I had was a letter that said,

"Wait here, we'll come later."

What does that mean?
I don't see where this is going.

When Kami-sama was child,
waited long time for parents.

My house was right there, in Yunzabit.

I believed that my parents
would surely come back for me.

But no matter how long I waited,
nobody ever came.

I wonder how long I must have waited.

years? Oh, no, perhaps .

I finally gave up, left my house
behind, and departed Yunzabit.

I would go back once in a while to look in on it,

but nothing ever changed.

So listen, what does any of
that have to do with this?

You impatient. Now getting to point.

Though, you know, thinking back
on it now, it was an odd house.

I didn't realize it until I
learned more about the world,

but that house was really unusual.

It was round, with four legs attached to it,

almost like some sort of bug.

The door didn't have any knobs or locks,

but would open when you spoke to it.

"Piccolo."

P--?

An entrance...

Get on top of here.

This is Kami-sama's house?

Say again, and it closes.

"Piccolo."

Look closely. This not house, but spaceship, yes?

That's right! Kami-sama is a Namekian!

That Kaio person did say that long ago,

Planet Namek was nearly wiped out
by abnormal climate, or whatnot.

Mister Popo also heard Kaio-sama speak.

Thought "what if," came here, and found this.

It's true, if this really is a spaceship,
it would all make sense.

When Planet Namek had crisis,

Kami-sama's parents put child
Kami-sama aboard, and sent to Earth.

His parents planned to escape afterward,

but there was some accident...

Yeah! I mean, any way you look at it,

this doesn't seem like a house.

I-It must be... a spaceship!

But even if that's the case, can we use it?

The entrance worked,
so it must have some power.

Is this the main switch? No. Let's see, this...

That's not right, either.

That's strange. I wonder if there's
a code number or something.

It doesn't look like this operates using buttons.

I don't get it.

I wonder if this is some kind of sensor.

Voice?

Yeah! it uses words, like the entrance did!

What to say? "Piccolo"?

No. After all, that was the
word for going in or out.

Move, you hear me? Fly! Let me see you fly!

That won't work. The language is different.

You have to speak Namekian.

I mean, back when Son-kun
fought against Piccolo,

I heard him speaking in some weird language.

That must be Namekian.

If that Namekian, Mister Popo knows it.

--Really?!
--Really.

Word "Piccolo" means
"other world" in that language.

So, is word for entrance.

Why didn't you say so sooner?

So Piccolo Daimao is the
"Demon King of Another World."

Here, try telling it to fly.

Fly to where?

Anywhere is fine.

I know, how about the Jupiter area?

Topul kuppa koloppungo.

I-Incredible! it's Jupiter!
This is an incredible spaceship!

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

Thank goodness.
Now Kami-sama sure to come back.

The spaceship is perfect!

That ship can get to Planet
Namek in just one month!

I just have to convert
the inside a little bit, and...

...hmm, yeah, it can launch in another five days.

To Planet Namek in Kami-sama's spaceship, huh?

That faint bit of light is about to come true.

With that being said, Popo-san,

we're counting on you to go to Planet Namek.

Eh? Mister Popo cannot go.

Mister Popo cannot go.

Would be away from Kami-sama's
palace for two months. Cannot do.

Come on! After all, you're the only
one who can speak Namekian!

You seem pretty tough, too.

Popo-san, you're the only one we can ask to go.

No worry. Will teach you Namekian.

Then, Bulma-san, you'll have to go.

If anything were to happen, Bulma-san,

you're the only one familiar
with mechanical stuff.

Fine. it doesn't seem particularly dangerous.

But I'm not going there by myself,
understand? Someone come with me.

I'm tellin' ya right now, no way in hell am I goin'.

--We wouldn't expect it of you.
--Son-kun is all laid up.

--What?!
--Kuririn, you'll come with me, right?

M-Me? I don't really mind.

Sounds nice. I wish I could go, too.

I want to see what kind of Shen Long
would appear in Planet Namek.

Now, Goku, you take it easy,

and come up with some
countermeasure against the Saiyan.

Right. it's up to you two.

U-Um...

P-Please take me with you, too!

G-Gohan-chan, what sort of
cockamamie jokes are you tellin'?

It isn't a joke! I-I really do want to go.

D-Don't be ridiculous. Another
two months, on top of all this?

I'm sorry. I want to go, for all the world.

I want to bring Piccolo-san
back to life with my own hands.

What kind of nonsense are you talkin' about?!

Sheesh, you haven't even healed all the way yet!

Physically, I'm all right.

W-What are you doin'?!

S-Stop that, Gohan-chan!

Please, take me with you.

I-I forbid anythin' of the kind!
I absolutely forbid it! Two months!

What about your cram school, and your lessons?!

Piccolo doesn't have anythin' to do with this!

You are a little boy! And boys
should behave like boys!

Shut up!

G-Gohan-chan has turned into a d-delinquent...

M-Mother, right now...

Right now really isn't the time to talk about that.

We have to bring back to life the
people who fought so desperately,

and died while trying to defend the Earth,

and fight back against the Saiyans once again.

I can... I can fight, too.

I have to... l have to do something.

Understand, Mother. I'm sorry.

He's got you beat, Chichi.

Let Gohan go off into space, with your blessin'.

Gohan, attaboy. You really have gotten stronger.

It'll be fine. No problem at all. Just leave it to us.

There won't be any danger this time around.

Can you learn Namekian in five days?

Let's see. I'll have to input
it all into a translator,

so I'll need ten days.

All right, see you in ten days, at the Kame House!

Right!

And so, in the blink of an eye, ten days pass,

and the day of the launch arrives.

Whew, is this thing really going
to get us to Planet Namek?

Quite a snappy little outfit there, Kuririn.

You're not, by any chance, making
light of outer space, are you?

I even cut my hair, since it would
be in the way inside my spacesuit!

Is that really you, Gohan?!
What happened to your hair?!

F-Father laughed at me, too.

Say what you will,

this is the first time mankind
is goin' out into space.

Can't have him bein' unmannerly.

We're counting on you. You be sure
you find those Dragon Balls, now.

Right.

"Piccolo."

Grandpa, Mother,
Mr. Turtle Hermit, and Mr. Turtle,

we're off! Take care.

"Piccolo."

Be sure you eat regularly.

Send me a letter, every day.

Bye, now.

It's a little bit exciting, huh?

Say, Bulma-san, where should we put our bags?

Just put them any old place!
Hurry up and sit down!

She's in a bad mood about something.

Blast off in five seconds.
Destination, Planet Namek.

J-J-Just a minute!

5.. 4...

3... 2...

B-B-Bulma-san! W-W-We haven't
f-f-fastened our belts y-y-yet!

That is incredible speed, to be sure.
They're out of sight already.

Gohan-chan! Don't forget to rinse!

Hmph, you're free to move around, now.

Now that we're out of the
atmosphere, things will be calm.

Already?

Huh? What are you doing, Bulma-san?

What a pest! I'm going to change my clothes!

Change your clothes? You mean, into pajamas?

Uh-oh. Come to think of it, I forgot my pajamas.

--What about you, Gohan?
--I made sure to bring mine.

Not that it's any of my business,

but could you do something
about that Shichigosan outfit?

This is just for the launch.

Actually, I made some clothes,
and kept it a secret from Mother.

Well?

You really do respect Piccolo, don't you?

Yes, about the same as Father.

Those are unusual pajamas, huh?

They look uncomfortable to sleep in.

These aren't pajamas, you know.
Looking at you two,

I felt like a fool for being so fired
up in getting ready for space.

H-Hey, have we done something wrong?

Beats me.


Dragon Ball Z Kai

A Formidable New Enemy! Emperor of the Universe, Freeza" / "A Powerful New Foe! Frieza, Ruler of the Universe!
  



"A Powerful New Foe!
The Emperor of the Universe, Freeza."

Ugh, I am bored to death.

Good grief, this is only the seventh day.

There are still twenty-some more days to go.

I should have built a
hibernation device or something.

Are you guys doing your image training again?

That's nice for you. You can pass the time.

Whew, not bad! You sure are strong.

After all, you've inherited Goku's blood,
and had Piccolo train you.

Still, I'm surprised at how many
techniques you have, Kuririn-san.

Say...

...it's up to you whether
you train inside your heads,

but the room is starting to get pretty messy,

so would you mind tidying it up?

There is a lady present.

But Bulma-san, you're the
one who made that mess.

We've cleaned up our own stuff.

I am busy. I have a lot of things
I have to think about, too.

You guys are just riding along,
so that's fine for you.

A moment ago, you said you were bored.

You hush. I wish you could
be nicer to a delicate lady.

Ah, I'm so busy, I'm so busy...

if she's such a lady, I wish she wouldn't
parade around in her underwear.

Say...

So anyway, I've been
wondering about this for a while,

but when that Saiyan Vegeta fled,
where did he flee to?

Where, you ask?

I mean, the Saiyan's world has
been gone for a long time, right?

Oh, yeah. In any event, he had
taken some serious damage,

so I'd think it would be
somewhere with a civilization.

Do you suppose there's anyplace like that?

That brother of Son-kun's said
something earlier, remember?

"We exterminate the people who live on planets

that have good environments,
and then sell them to aliens."

I wonder if Vegeta went to
one of those alien folks,

and is having them treat him.

If so, then whenever he comes to Earth again

would depend on where that planet is.

If it's far away, that will buy us some time.

I have to say,

Earth has attracted the attention
of one heck of a bad guy.

T-To think that something like this would happen...

It has been days since Vegeta left Earth.

All right, here!

Something's coming!

Is it Freeza-sama?

It couldn't be. He just barely departed.

It's a round pod. That's a combatant.

The signal belongs to Vegeta-sama!

That's strange. We've received
no word that he was returning.

Could something have happened?

Hey this is the flight control room!

Vegeta-sama is about to arrive!
Fall out to greet him at once!

He's here!

It's just one craft, all right! Where is Nappa-san?

I-Is something the matter? He's not coming out.

Hey, his life sign readings are awfully low.

What?

He's using his life support equipment!

This is bad! Hurry and carry
him to the treatment room!

There.

You are healed. You may open your eyes.

Unfortunately, I was unable to regrow your tail.

No matter. it will grow back in due time.

Vegeta-sama, as mighty as you are,

you were put to quite a bit
of trouble, weren't you?

If this superstrong rubber
protector was left in tatters,

you were lucky to return to us in one piece.

It would take quite a bit
for this to end up like this.

What in the world happened
on this planet Earth?

Is Freeza-sama around?

N-No, he has departed.

He's already tired of this planet, is he?

U-Um, Kewie-sama said that...

...once your treatment was completed,
he needed to speak to you,

and to report to the Training Room.

Hmph, you tell him that I said, unfortunately,

I don't have anything to talk to him about.

B-But...

Vegeta-sama, um, you forgot your Scouter.

I don't need it. You can have it.

I'll head for Earth first thing in the morning.

This time, I'll blow them to smithereens for sure.

No, before that, I'll go to Planet Namek...

Yo, Vegeta! Word is you got your butt kicked.

I hear Raditz and Nappa are dead, too.

Who was it that caused the supposedly
invincible Saiyans such agony?

Get lost, Kewie. I don't have time
to listen to your worthless drivel.

Now, just listen.

Freeza-sama is upset with you,
going off by yourselves like that.

If he's not here, he can't gripe about it.

Now,

remove that filthy hand of yours.

Still, Freeza-sama is a magnanimous person.

He seems willing to forgive you,

since you discovered
something quite sensational.

What?

He was thrilled that he might be
able to gain eternal life and youth.

Say what?! Then, you mean
Freeza-sama departed for...

Hmph, Planet Namek.

Damn! He was listening in to what
we were saying on the Scouters?!

I have to beat him to it, or I'll be
that bastard's puppet forever!

You apparently wanted to use
the Dragon Balls to get eternal life,

but you'll have to give up on that now.

Once Freeza-sama has his wish granted,

he plans to exterminate the Namekians.

That bastard!

Hey, Vegeta!

V-Vegeta-sama!

Give me that!

I'm going to need it after all!

Vegeta!

I won't let you do it! They belong to me!

Not again.

Four more.

Geez, Son-san, you can't do this.

Miss Nurse, I'm all right now.

Goku, you see, is immortal.

Oh, did I just do something?

It must be my age. Lately,
my mind has been slipping...

Oh, for the love of...

These sponge cakes are delicious.

Ahem!

Doctor!

How many times must I tell you?

If you keep this up, you'll never be discharged.

But as you can see, I'm...

I'm sure that hurts. You have been
quite seriously injured, after all.

Now get back to bed.

S-Sorry.

Come on, Grandpa Glad-hands, help him up.

G-Grandpa Glad-hands?

Grandpa Glad-hands, am I?

My word...

"Grandpa Glad-hands."

Where is his wife, who was looking after him?

Oh, she must have gone up to the
roof again, to look up into the sky.

I wonder if Gohan-chan is doin' okay.

And after all my insistin' that
he send me a letter every day,

I haven't gotten a single one.

Come back to me soon, safe and sound.

days after leaving Earth,

Bulma and the others at last reach
their destination of Planet Namek.

We made it! There it is!

Wow! it sure is pretty!

That world is Planet Namek, huh?

No doubt about it!

The computer vouches that this
is the bona fide Planet Namek!

We got here just about right
on schedule, didn't we?

That's Kami-sama's spaceship for you!

That was smooth sailing, all right!

Sure was! Now, sit down and fasten
your seatbelts so we can land.

There's going to be a pretty hard jolt.

Right!

Begin landing procedures
for any suitable location.

We made it! We landed on Planet Namek!

We're here!

Hang on. I'm going to check the
atmospheric components now.

I made sure to install some
sensors. Aren't I prepared?

We'll be lucky if there's a
certain amount of oxygen.

I did prepare some atmospheric masks,

but our time would be limited,
and I don't know how much help--

This is a lot like the place
where Piccolo-san trained me.

Yeah, that place where we
fought the Saiyans first, right?

I guess he'd instinctively feel more
at ease in a place like his home.

Piccolo-san...

You guys don't have the least bit
of common sense, do you?!

How can you just stroll on out here?!

You're as scary as ever...

For crying out loud. Well, as long
as there are Dragon Balls here...

Please!

Look! I'm reading them!

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

K-Kuririn-san, I feel some strong Ki over there.

Ki?

You're right.

I'm feeling a lot of them.

Yeah. And what's more,
they're all really powerful Ki.

W-What does that mean?

Oh, you guys. What are you talking about?

Those are Namekians.

As strong as Kami-sama and Piccolo were,

it's not at all surprising
that the Namekians at home

would have powerful Ki, too.

--But...
--These Ki feel a little bit evil, don't they?

It's all right, I tell you.

Kaio-sama said that Namekians
are peaceful by nature, didn't he?

Over in that direction,

there are four Dragon Balls gathered together.

Now, let's go and meet the Namekians!

Yeah... You're right. They must be Namekians!

I feel silly for being scared.

Haven't we seen that before somewhere?

It's a Saiyan spaceship!

I knew it!

--It can't be!
--Oh, no, for real? Why?!

Gohan, mask your presence! We'll be detected!

R-Right!

I-It's Vegeta. it couldn't be anyone else.

D-Damn it!

He's already recovered from his injuries?

Come to think of it, he knows
about the Dragon Balls, too.

W-What do we do? it's hopeless now!

All we can do is go back to Earth, right?
Am I right? Let's hurry back!

If that guy gets his hands on
the Dragon Balls, it's all over.

Bulma-san, please contact Earth,
tell them about this,

and then return there by yourself.

Gohan and I will stay here,
and try to collect the Dragon Balls.

But...

it's all right. We'll have the Dragon Radar.

--Right, Gohan?
--Right!

Okay.

Once I get back to Earth,

I'll bring Son-kun aboard, and come right back.

The round trip will take a little over two months.

Sit tight, okay?

It'll be fine! Two months will go by like that!

It's just days! That's only , hours,

, minutes, or , , seconds!

Right?

Right, a little over two months.

Freeza, you bastard.

You're trying to grab them away
from me, but I won't let you.

I should be able to handle
everyone besides Freeza,

but I don't stand a chance fighting him head-on.

I have to steal the Dragon Balls
and gain eternal life, no matter what.

Tch! To think that I would wind
up using a Scouter again...

This way, huh?

He brought Zarbon and Dodoria with him.

W-What did you say?!

A-And then?

Yeah. So tell Son-kun and the others.

Do you hear me? Just don't
tell Chichi-san. Got it?

Yeah... Yeah... Like I said...

No! it's not like that! Sheesh!

Right! You got it? I'm counting on you. Bye, now.

For Pete's sake...

What's the matter, you two?

Huh? What?

W-W-Why is that thing coming here again?!

T-That's what I'd like to know.

I found it, Freeza-sama.

Oh, good, good.

Now there are three of them left.


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Rebellion Against Freeza! Vegeta, Burning with Ambition"

  

"Rebellion Against Freeza!
Vegeta's Burning Ambition."

Now there are three of them left.

Hold on to those carefully, Dodoria-san.

It appears that Vegeta is after them, as well.

Freeza-sama, Kewie has just landed, in pursuit of Vegeta.

Also, the two large power readings that appeared shortly before Vegeta arrived suddenly disappeared, and remain so.

Our men are searching the area where the readings came from, so we should find out their source momentarily.

Well, the problem is how to deal with Vegeta, who has turned against me.

In that case, you need not worry.

Kewie is on his way to dispose of Vegeta.

The two of them have always hated each other, and their abilities are just about evenly matched.

Whatever happens, Vegeta will not come out unharmed.

Vegeta, you won't get away!

I found you, Vegeta. I have orders from Freeza-sama.

Do you read me, Vegeta? Now I can kill you, without any reservations!

Don't make me laugh, Kewie. 
Do you really think you can k*ll me?

Hurry up and get here. I'm waiting for you.

What are you, blind? Take a good look at your Scouter!

My battle power is clearly higher than yours!

In any event, we can't just stay here, huh?

I'll let you guys take care of getting the Dragon Balls.

Okay, I'm going back to Earth, so good luck.

Kuririn-san, someone is coming!

The readings vanished right around here.

Probably a Namekian.

Who is it?

It's probably a Namekian.

That's not a Namekian!

W-Who's that?

T-They're not Namekians. Who are they?

It doesn't really matter.

We've got orders to kill everyone on this planet.

Look at their outfits!

They're just like what the Saiyans were wearing.

But they aren't Saiyans!

I don't know what any of this means,
but I've got a bad feeling.

Y-Yeah. Any way you look at it,

those are not the sort of faces
that say "let's be friends."

Gohan, build up your Ki,
but keep your presence masked.

R-Right.

You see that? Their battle
power is pretty much trash.

Are these guys just tourists?

We won't have any fun if they get away from us.

Take out their spaceship first.

All right.

Oh, no! The spaceship!

These guys are unlucky to have
come here at a time like this.

Gohan, release your Ki.
These guys aren't all that tough.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, did you hear that?

Not that tough? Does he mean us?

W-What's with these battle power ratings?!

--Let's get them!
--Right!

Hey, nice, nice!

That was not nice!

What do we do about that?

Is something the matter, Zarbon-san?

Yes, Freeza-sama. it concerns the
scouts that were sent out earlier.

Apparently, these guys are
not your average people.

For a moment, their battle powers rose, and then, after defeating our two scouts, their readings disappeared again.

Ho, that is unusual. it doesn't appear to be Vegeta, either.

No, Vegeta's reading is separate.

Both of these battle powers were around 1,500 .

1,500 , you say? Nothing would come of it if we left them alone, but their attitude seems poor.

The next time they appear, eliminate them.

It's hopeless! it's all over!
I'll never get back to Earth again!

Bulma-san, for now,
let's get away from this place.

There could be trouble.
Someone stronger might be coming.

He's right. Those many Ki that we
sensed are apparently not Namekians,

but friends of Vegeta,

so we have to find someplace to hide.

We'll manage something.

I'm sure the Namekians will fix the spaceship.

How nice that you're so optimistic.

Bulma-san...

Hmph, you're finally here...

...you moron.

The time is finally here, when we
can settle the score, as rivals.

However, you've lost your touch.
With that battle power,

you have no chance of beating me.

As rivals, you say?

Well, let me show you something.

When I was on Earth, I picked up
something interesting from them.

What, how to run away quickly?

How to control my battle power.

How to control your battle power?

Take a good look at my battle
power rating on your Scouter!

I-Impossible! Our battle powers
have always been evenly matched!

You imbecile! I have been constantly
engaged in actual combat!

The fight I had on Earth nearly k*lled me.

Did you think I would remain
evenly matched with you,

with you staying all curled up next to Freeza?!

17,000 ... 19,000 ... 21,000 ... 22,000 ...!

What happened, Zarbon?

I-I think it was a malfunction,

but the Scouter I had set to Vegeta
had a rating of around 22,000 .

22,000 ? That really must have been a malfunction.

Your Scouter is an older model, after all.

I'll get the correct reading with mine.

What's the rating?

T-That's impossible! Is my newer
model malfunctioning, too?

It's risen to 24,000 !

24,000? Are you saying that his
battle power is higher than ours?

I-It can't be. His battle power
topped out at 18,000.

There is no reason to be surprised.

Vegeta has been fighting at the forefront, after all.

He must have come across some trick while he was on Earth.

But sir...

it is only 24,000. At that level, if you fight him together,

it will be enough to beat him, will it not?

W-Wait, Vegeta! I just had an idea!
Let me team up with you!

I-I'll help you! I've never been fond
of Freeza-sama-- I mean, Freeza!

N-Not a bad idea, right? W-With your
battle power, if we teamed up,

I think we could handle Zarbon and Dodoria!

Just keep spouting your worthless lies!

You are one thoroughly sickening bastard!

Believe me, Vegeta!

Ah! Freeza-sama!

What?!

You fool!

I don't care how much your
battle power has risen,

if you took that unawares,
you don't stand a chance!

You wish.

That was a perfectly pathetic strategy,
coming from someone like you.

I'm stunned.

W-When did you...?

If my battle power has risen,
it means my speed has risen, too!

Which means, you've completely
enraged me with that move!

Die!

What a messy firework.

V-Vegeta's rating of 24,000 was genuine after all.

He defeated Kewie like it was nothing.

It is no great concern.

Now, to look for the fifth Dragon Ball.

Thanks to their Scouters,
they'll know what action I've taken.

Even if I'm careless enough to get close to them,

though I may be able to take Zarbon or Dodoria,

not even I could beat Freeza.

Judging by the transmissions from Freeza's men that I heard on my Scouter, the Dragon Balls don't have any effect unless you have all seven of them together. All right.

I'll find just one of them.
Once they've gathered the other six,

I'll find an opening to steal them.

If it goes right, I'll have them all,
and gain eternal life.

Then defeating Freeza will
be more than just a dream.

I am reading ten or so
Namekians in that direction.

Very well. it sure would be nice
if they have the fifth Dragon Ball.

Please be sure not to let your guard down.

After all, it appears that there
are some other curious fellows

out there beside Vegeta.

--Yes, sir.
--Now, let us be going.

Once he's out of the way, I'll be Number One.

L, the Saiyan, Vegeta,
will rule the entire universe!

Bulma-san, we have to hurry it up a little more.

We'll be spotted out here.

You guys can fly, right? Then take me and fly.

We'd like to do so, but we have
to walk to mask our presence.

Bulma-san, up there is a good place.

It will be hard to spot us inside that cave.

How long am I going to have
to live in a place like that?

Kuririn-san...

Do you sense any Ki over there?

You're right. These Ki feel
different from those others earlier.

They could really be Namekians this time.

Hide! There are some other Ki
coming this way from over there!

--What, now?
--Come on, hurry!

What in the world is going on?!

They're coming this way.

Do you think they know about us?

I don't know.

They're here!

T-They're gone. Thank goodness.

Apparently, we weren't what
they were after. But then,

what exactly was that just now?

What's the matter, you two?

B-Bulma-san, would you confirm
something with the Dragon Radar?

W-What?

When you checked earlier,

there were four Dragon Balls
gathered together, right?

Would you see where they are now?

All right, I'll look.

All four of them are moving! Which means...

Yeah, no doubt about it!

Those guys just now were
carrying the four Dragon Balls!

T-They were?

I knew it.

Gohan...

Gohan!

--Yes?
--Gohan, did you see him?

The strange one who was
flying second from the front?

Yes.

I sensed a tremendous power from him.

T-The moment I saw him, I was petrified.

H-He could be much, much
worse than even Vegeta.

I-It looked like there were
some other heavy hitters there,

but he, for one, is in a league of his own.

Worse than Vegeta? Oh, no. Who was he?

I-I don't know, but I think
they were Vegeta's friends.

They all had on the same sort of clothing.

Damn it, how are we supposed
to get the Dragon Balls

away from those guys?!

Say, look here.

That group is headed
toward another Dragon Ball.

What's going on? Do they have a Radar, too?

What location is it?

About kilometers in this direction.

Kuririn-san, that's the place where we sensed Ki

that you said could be Namekians.

I'm going to go there and see what's happening.

I'm going, too!

J-Just a minute!

Are you going to leave me here, all by myself?

It's far safer for you to stay here

than it is to fumble your way around.

When you put it that way, you're right.

Okay, we're off.

Hurry back, okay?

Remember, Gohan, hurry, but suppress
your Ki as much as you can.

--Can you do that?
--Yes!

All right!

There they go. I wonder if they're really all right.

Oh yeah, I have to contact Earth.

Really?

So then, are Gohan and the others okay?

Yeah. They did in fact arrive
safely on Planet Namek.

But Gohan and the others aren't
the only ones who went to Namek.

That Saiyan named Vegeta is also there.

Vegeta?! He's there?!

And that's not all. In addition to Vegeta,

there are a over a dozen of
his friends on Planet Namek.

The spaceship they rode
there in was blasted by them,

and they can't get back to Earth now.

W-What?!

What's more, they said that at least one of them

had a Ki that was greater than Vegeta's.

It can't be! A Ki greater than Vegeta's?
There's a guy like that?

Yo, you still alive?

What?! Here I come all this way
to see ya, why the long face?

The senzu beans're finally ready.
Just a few of 'em, though.

Karin-sama said to take all seven
of the senzu beans that're ready.

Wow, all right! That's what I call good timing!

Hurry up and give me one!

S-See here! You mustn't give
strange foods to patients!

Here ya go.

I've been waiting for this moment!

Here it is! Kaio-sama sent this
new gi to me, just for this day!

All right, I'm off to Planet Namek now!

Oh, thanks, I'll take the
remaining senzu beans with me.

Planet Namek? How are
you planning to get there?

When Bulma's daddy came to visit me,

I made sure to ask him to build
me a spaceship, just in case.

A spaceship? You mean like Kami-sama's?

That was made from stuff that ain't from Earth,

so not even Bulma's daddy could pull that off.

S-So then...?

I thought about it hard,

and realized that there are two
other Saiyan spaceships on Earth.

The spaceship my brother came here in,

and the spaceship that I came
to Earth in when I was a kid.

O-Oh, right!

I had Bulma's daddy go look for it.

My brother's blew up with that other one,

but mine was from way back,
so it ended up unharmed.

I'm having him repair and reconstruct it.

Kinto Un!

Okay, I'm gonna go save them.

Mm-hmm.

Take me to Bulma's house!

He's going to save them? From what?

As it turns out...

if things're as hairy as all that,
why'd that bastard look so happy?

It must be his Saiyan blood, I'd say.

It goes without saying that
he wants to save everyone,

but more than anything,

he seems to get a huge thrill
from fighting someone strong.

That guy ain't normal, all right.
I can't keep up with him.

Unbelievable. To think that
there's someone out there

even stronger than Vegeta!

My, my, are you all better already?

Just like you see.

By the way, is the refit on the
spaceship I ordered done yet?

Well, I'm not sure. it looked like
he was still working on something.

Eep! Still?! Geez, what to do?

He's in the inner yard. Come along.

I have to say, who would have
thought that little Goku-chan

would grow up to be so handsome?

Say, let's have a date sometime, okay? Okay?

I-I have to defeat the Saiyan, first.

Aren't you the busy one?

Oh, right, I found the most delicious
cake shop a little while ago.

All thanks to you, Goku-chan.

If the Earth had been gone,
I wouldn't have been able to have any.

I guess not.

Dear! Goku-chan is here!

I-Is that...

...my spaceship?

It's huge!

Hey there, Goku. Better already?

Mm-hmm, thanks to a senzu bean.

This is mine, right? Is it true
you ain't finished with it yet?

Mm-hmm, it's almost ready.
Come on inside and have a look.

Well, I'll bring you something to drink, okay?

Thanks.

Awesome! I'm surprised that
tiny spaceship became all this!

What can I say?
Everything is made to your order.

I'll be able to do some decent training like this.

I worked hard on this. Finding
the spaceship was hard enough,

but it was all broken up in pieces.

Luckily, all the important parts remained,

but I had to rebuild almost all of it.

My spaceship was in pieces?

That's strange. I wonder if
I busted it when I was a kid.

Well, I have to admit, Saiyan
science is absolutely fantastic.

Huh? Um, where's the artificial gravity device?

This is it over here.

Oh, yeah? This thing?

Let's see, this here is the switch.

This here is the controller.

It can put out a maximum of
100 Gs, just like you ordered,

but that would be crazy,
even for you, wouldn't it?

At 100 Gs, if you weigh 30 kg,
that would make you 6,000 kg!

That's six tons. Ordinarily, that would kill you.

That's okay. Unless I train someplace like that,

I ain't gonna beat the Saiyan.

So, can't this thing fly yet?

Oh, it will fly. To the ends of the universe.

Huh? Then...

The bathroom, kitchen, and
bedroom are down that ladder.

So then, what part of it ain't done yet?

I can't quite settle on the
location for the stereo speakers.

As long as you're listening,
you'll want it to sound good, right?

T-That's all?!

When you say it ain't done yet,
that's all that's left?!

That's all? In order to hear top sound,

you have to think about
reverberation and such. it's quite tricky.

Never mind about where to put the stereo!

I'm in a hurry, so I need to take off right now!

What are you in such a rush for?

I got a message from Bulma!
In any event, I have to hurry!

Hurry up and show me how to fly this thing!

All right. So, you're sure about
the stereo placement, then?

All the data has been inputted already.

All you have to do is give
the button a little bop-bop,

and you'll arrive at Planet Namek in six days.

Six days? I can get there in
just six days? That's awesome!

Is it true? Goku is here?

Yes. He's looking at the
spaceship in the inner yard now.

Oh, my!

Oh, my goodness!

Let's see, it's this button next, right?

Considering how hastily I put that together,

it really did fly.

Huh? Where's Goku?

He left in a big hurry.

I hope he's sure about the stereo.

Wow, this thing sure is fast, all right.

I have to start training, right away.

I'm glad I'll get there in six days,

but I've gotta surpass that
Vegeta guy before then.

Let's see, if I remember right,

Kaio-sama said his planet was 10-times gravity.

Maybe I should get accustomed
to 20-times, to start out with.

That's kicking in, all right.

We're close. We are close.
Surpress your Ki completely now.

We'll walk up and approach from here.

Right.

They're on the other side of that cliff.

That Ki is incredible!

Those houses are just like
the spaceship we came here in.

What are they up to?

The other guys are one thing, but those three--

especially the one in the middle,
inside that round vehicle--

have a frighteningly strong Ki.

I-I can tell.

Look at what the two guys on his
side are holding in their hands!

Those are Dragon Balls!

Gigantic Dragon Balls!

Is something the matter, Dodoria-san?

No, there was just a small
power reading up on that cliff.

It is gone now. it must have been
a small animal, or an insect.

Holy crap! We were this close to being spotted!

Freeza-sama, we have only found five of them.

The others appear to be out at the moment.

Come on out of there, unless you'd rather die.

That looks just like Piccolo-san!

I-It's a Namekian!

What are they planning
to do with the Namekian?

Kuririn-san, are they all Saiyans?

No, they aren't. They all have
the same battlewear on,

but they aren't Saiyans. For one thing,

Vegeta is supposed to be
the only Saiyan remaining.

Not counting Goku or yourself.

T-Then...

Come to think of it, Goku's older
brother mentioned something.

Our job is to travel around the universe,

looking for planets that
have good environments,

exterminating the people already living on them,

and then selling them to aliens seeking
a suitable planet for a high price.

It could be that he was pals with these guys.

I have to admit, though, I don't
see Vegeta around anywhere.

Is he off looking for
Dragon Balls someplace else?

As you can see, I am collecting your
Dragon Balls. My name is Freeza.

Now then,

where are the others who were here?

According to our search,

there are supposed to be ten of you.

Do you intend not to say anything?

I will kill you.

Now, let me have your answer.

Nuwainita hanitaemao moteleki koeto...

Speak in language that we can
understand, as well, not in Namekian.

I know that you can speak it.

The others have left to work the farms.

All that are left are us
older ones and the children.

Yes, if I can have you answer
me straightforwardly like that,

I will not do anything to you.

Now then, let me have you
continue to answer my questions.

Where is your Dragon Ball?

I believe there is one here, as well.

I-I don't know! We don't have anything like that!

Dodoria-san...

Yes, sir?

The second Namekian we killed, as I recall,

said something quite interesting, did he not?

Yes, something about him not being
able to hand over his Dragon Ball,

except to one judged to be a man of valor.

Yes, yes. That man proved to be quite stubborn.

We simply could not get
him to cooperate with us,

until we killed one of them,
to serve as an example.

Once we did, he told us all sorts of things.

That the Grand Elder of this world
created the seven Dragon Balls;

That the seven elders each held
one of them with great care;

And that each of them would ask to
match wits, extend tests of strength,

and discuss the reasons for one's wish.

Then, once one is judged to be
a man of valor by each elder,

one would finally be able to obtain them.

However, even though I tried
to do as was asked of me,

I was told that he would never
hand it over to me, you see?

So I could not help myself but to k*ll him.

As such, it took a great deal
of effort to locate the first one.

The next three were quite easy.
Everyone was quite accommodating.

Hmph, I see.

So that's the deal.

A-Accommodating, you say?!

You are lying!

Yeah! There's no way the other elders

handed them over to you without any protest!

I beg to differ. Once we did this,
they quickly became amenable.

Zarbon-san, if you would show them.

Yes, sir.

Why, you...!

Stop!

W-What fiends!

H-How awful!

Gohan, control your Ki! They'll know we're here!

But if we don't do something...

I mean, you want to bring Piccolo
and everyone else back to life, right?

There's no way we can take on someone like that.

If we show ourselves now, we'd only die in vain.

What do you say? Are you feeling
a little more compliant now? Hmm?

What is your purpose in
collecting the Dragon Balls?

Oh, it is quite a frivolous little wish.

I was thinking of gaining eternal life.

He's what?! Then, what about Vegeta?

H-He's out for eternal life, too.

Do you suppose they aren't friends with Vegeta?

I don't know.

The likes of you will get the
Dragon Ball over my dead body!

So you are saying you
would rather choose death

than give your Dragon Ball to me? I see.

The people of this planet seem
to be very stubborn, indeed.

But then...

...can you still remain stubborn
after the death of those children?

W-What?!

You'd even go after children?!

There's a strong battle power.

Freeza-sama, over there!

Oh, you've come, have you?

The Namekians!

They're coming to help!

Damn, that ill foreboding I felt proved true!

We cannot have this, can we?

I was finally about to have the
Dragon Ball brought out, too.

Imagine, you interrupting your work,

so that you could come here and be killed.

I see now. The rumors of
people attacking the villages

and stealing the Dragon Balls are true, are they?

You'll pay for this!

How dare you trample
the peace of Planet Namek?!

Ho, you intend to fight us?
How great is your battle power?

Dodoria-san?

Yes, sir, I will check.

Please do not be disappointed.
All three are in the vicinity of 1,000 .

There is no need for us to even fight them.

So that's it. I now understand how they are able

to so precisely locate our few
villages, which dot the land

across the vastness of Planet Namek.

They are able to search, using those devices!

How laughable!

You want to tangle with us,
with a battle power of 1,000 ?! Eh?!

He's wrong. Those three are
just suppressing their Ki.

Don't these guys even know that much?

The Saiyans were surprised by that, as well, huh?

Let 'em have it!

What is this? That's what you
call a battle power of 1,000 ?

What's going on here?
All three have increased to 3,000 !

Well, well, they are pretty good, are they not?

I get it. The Namekians are a race

that are able to control their battle power.

Such is a very rare type.

All right. Including his,

there are only three of those
devices that remain unbroken.

Children,

stand away from me.

Quickly!

Dodoria-san...

Yes, sir.

You guys are pathetic.

You're going to trouble me with this, are you?

May I take care of all three of them?

Feel free.

Y-You bastard! Did you really
think you could defeat me

with such a petty technique?

Oh, no! He was going after the Scouters!

Scouters?

T-Those devices that can tell an
opponent's strength and location!

So that's it! Then they can't
determine the precise location

of the Dragon Balls after all!

They use those Scouter things
to look for the Namekians,

and then strong-arm them!

Which is why, when the
old-timer there figured it out,

he destroyed all of their Scouters!

Why, you...!

I-I'll kill them all!

I'll kill them all!!

I'll kill every last one of them!

Elder! Look out!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 


Dodoria in Terrifying Hot Pursuit! Vegeta Learns the Truth" 
  

--Elder!
--Dodoria-san! Just a moment!

Begin by first killing the three younger ones!

Damn it!

I'll put all three of you away in ten seconds!

Ridiculous! Do you think you're
a match for all three of us?!

Am I a match for all three of you, you ask?

Such an amusing joke.

What?!

--What?!
--It's no use!

It will take more than that attack to defeat him!

You must now realize that defying me

or trying to run away will do you no good.

But, in any event, come on down here.

You have finally become compliant. That will do.

You destroyed our precious Scouters.

What do you say you produce your
Dragon Ball for me, to apologize?

I've got no other choice.
But promise me one thing:

That you will not harm
the children, no matter what!

It could have been this way from the beginning.

Why, those lousy...!

H-Hey, Gohan, don't go getting any funny ideas.

We are just no match for those guys.

Now, take this, and leave here at once!

Good work.

While we are at it, how about you tell me

where the other two Dragon Balls are?

Don't be absurd! We Namekians
would die before doing anything

like selling each other out!

Now, hurry up and get out
of here, like you promised.

My, my, not you, too?

No one on this planet ever says
anything about their companions.

Sure enough, I must have you die,
along with the children.

What did you say?!

That wasn't our agreement!

You said if I gave you the Dragon Ball,
you wouldn't do anything to us!

But unless you have all
seven Dragon Balls together,

there is no meaning, is there?

You have destroyed our Scouters,

so I must ask you to tell us where
the remaining two balls are.

I told you, I'll die before telling
you where my people are!

Is that how badly you wish to die?

In that case, I will do as you ask.

What?!

kill all three of them.

--Yes, sir.
--T-That was dirty!

You two run away! Run away from here!

R-Right!

Let me show you some Namekian pride!

Cargot!

Control yourself, Gohan!

Control yourself! There's nothing we can do!

Cargot... Cargot! Cargot!

You never had time to show
us your so-called "pride"!

It's a trivial matter to crush a kid like this.

Well, be that as it may, die!

Stop!!

What?! A buddy of yours?! Where?!

That'll show you!

W-Who are you?!

That idiot!

I am going to belt you!

You're gonna what?

Kuririn-san?

Y-You dumb-ass! G-Get out of here, quick!

Quick!

Right!

D-Damn it...

Go after them! Dodoria-san, catch them!

Gohan! Fly as fast as you can!
If they catch us, it's all over!

Right!

You fools! Do you think you can get away?!

It's no use! He's faster than us!

He's catching up!

Gohan!

Oh, no!

Damn it!

I won't make it in time!

Gohan, run! Hurry! He's coming!

Damn, these guys sure are slippery!

Kuririn-san, let's descend and fight him!

We can't! He's not an opponent we
can get anywhere with by fighting!

Just keep flying as fast as you can!

Ah, I know!

Gohan, from here on, don't look
in my direction! Close your eyes!

I have an idea. Got it?!

Yes!

Take this!

Taiyo-ken!!

My eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

I did it! I-it worked!

Gohan, hide now, while we can!

Right!

Damn it, where did you go?!

Damn it all!

It's all right. He'll never find us.

The old man destroying those
Scouter things really saved our butts!

If he had one of them,

he could even detect the Ki
coming from that little kid, after all.

Damn, how am I supposed
to find those puny guys?

This is driving me crazy!

Thank goodness. He's giving up, and leaving.

I'll just blow them away.

See you in hell!

Take that. That's what you
get for sneaking around.

Freeza-sama told me to bring them back,

but this is better than letting them get away.

But then, I never did find out
who those punks really were.

They weren't your run-of-the-mill kids.

But it doesn't matter either way, now.

We're saved!

For now, let's head back to
where Bulma-san is, okay?

Are you able to fly?

Y-Yes.

T-Thank you so much for saving me.

If you want to thank someone,
thank Gohan, here.

I was so scared, I didn't want to help.

But Kuririn-san, if you hadn't
saved us, we'd both be dead.

Well, in any case, come with us.

We're not exactly the bad guys here, after all.

Okay.

There are, in fact, Dragon Balls here,

but these weirdoes keep ganging together,

And if they all get taken away like this,

there's no reason why a fragile lady like me

should have to risk all the danger
to come to this planet, is there?

Am I right?

Hey, Dad, are you listening?!

Oh, yes, I'm listening to every word.
So, what's the matter?

Anyhow, everything is as bad as it can be.

The spaceship is all busted up,
and we can't come home.

Come home?

That's not a good idea, is it?

Goku just barely took off for there.

Huh? Son-kun? Son-kun is
coming here to Planet Namek?

Really? He really, really is?

Yeah, that's right. He's scheduled
to arrive in about six days.

Hooray!

Hey, Bulma!

You know, without Scouters,

it's gonna be a big pain finding
those last two Dragon Balls.

Sure, it's not that big a planet, but still...

V-Vegeta! Why, you...!

Yo! it's been quite a long while,
hasn't it, Dodoria-san?

A-Are you the one that blindsided me, Vegeta?

You and Zarbon are always hanging
around with Freeza, after all.

I was waiting for you to go out on your own.

After all, as long as Freeza isn't
around, I'll bet I can handle you.

What?! A Saiyan like you?! You've got
quite a smart mouth, don't you?!

Vegeta, you hand over that Scouter,
nice and easy, and then beat it.

Do that, and I'll let you go this one time.

So that's it. The sound cut out all of a sudden,

so I thought something must have happened,

and sure enough, it sounds
like you've lost your Scouters.

This is great. Now, if I approach,
you won't know it.

What did you say?!

It will take several days for you
to go back to Planet Freeza

to fetch some more Scouters.

I'll bet you want this.

You've decided to hand it over, huh?

It's about time you felt intimidated.

Now, if you're lucky, I might just spare your life.

H-How could you do that, Vegeta?!

W-Why did you destroy it?

Because I don't need it anymore.

W-What? Without that thing,

you don't know where Freeza-sama
or the Namekians are, either.

Unfortunately for you...
while fighting the earthlings,

I learned that they could tell an
opponent's strength and location

without having to use a Scouter.

And there was another Saiyan there
who possessed the technique.

In which case, I should be
able to do it, too, right?

It's easy, once you learn how to do it.

Although, it would be too much
for you or Freeza to handle,

since you only have your eyes set on power.

But then, I was like that, too, up to now.

I get it! Those runts I was chasing
were earthlings, weren't they?

Earthlings?!

You've joined up with the
earthlings, haven't you?!

Dream on! There's no way the
earthlings could have come here.

If they were here, I'd take
care of them first thing!

None of that matters! Just get out of here!

Unless you'd rather I kill you!

L-I'm offering to let you go!
You should be grateful!

What are you so scared of?
Why don't you come at me, already?

I know why.

You learned from my fight with Kewie

that my strength is much
greater than it was before,

and now you're afraid!

You saw it on your Scouter, right?

My battle power?

T-That rating was wrong!
It was a Scouter malfunction!

Don't you shrug me off!

You're the one who's shrugged me off!

There's no way that move
was going to work on me!

We Saiyans grow stronger with every fight.

The stronger our opponents are,
the more our strength increases.

That's why, after nearly getting
killed in battle on Earth,

I've powered way up!

That's what the warrior Saiyan race does!

Is this what's become of your vaunted
power with you slacking off? Eh?

W-Wait, Vegeta! if you'll let me go,

I'll let you in on a little secret!

It's about your homeworld, Planet Vegeta!

What?

Did you say Planet Vegeta?

What secret about Planet Vegeta?!

Let me go! Let me go, and I'll tell you!

Y-You're not gonna kill me as
soon as I've told you, are you?

I'll kill you right now unless
you tell me! Start talking!

Your homeworld of Planet Vegeta

wasn't lost in a collision with a giant meteor,

like Freeza-sama told you.

What did you say?

Individually, a Saiyan's strength
is nowhere near Freeza-sama's...

But if a bunch of Saiyans united together,

it would prove to be quite a problem.

What's more,

there were a small number of
Saiyans being born who, like you,

were becoming extraordinary warriors,

and the number was starting to grow.

Once you started inexplicably
possessing such power,

you wouldn't remain an obedient,
order-following race forever,

so at that point,

Freeza-sama decided that
he needed to take measures.

And so, Freeza-sama destroyed Planet Vegeta,

and all of the Saiyans on it, himself!

But Vegeta, you should be
grateful to Freeza-sama.

It appeared that he could make
use the prodigious skills of you,

the prince of Planet Vegeta,

and so Freeza-sama intentionally waited

until you were no longer on the planet.

Looks like your shock is as great as you'd expect.

I'll just use this opportunity
to return to Freeza-sama.

Don't misunderstand, Dodoria.

I don't give a damn about the planet,
my friends, or my parents.

I'm just disgusted at myself for not knowing this,

and letting myself be used as your
doormat ever since I was a kid!

Freeza-sama!

Freeza is afraid of the fathomless
potential of the Saiyans.

I have to hurry up and
conquer this -times gravity.

Now, to get started!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Vegeta's Secret Plan! Tragic Attack Upon the Namekians" 
  

I've killed Dodoria.

For all the power that Dodoria
prided himself on, it was easy.

I've improved so much, even I am surprised.

That battle on Earth was
indeed good for something.

Although I have to admit,
Dodoria did say something unusual.

I get it! Those runts I was chasing
were earthlings, weren't they?

True, I do sense two large powers
getting farther away from me.

They couldn't possibly be
earthlings, but it does bother me.

Maybe I should go check them out.

Whoever they are, I have to eliminate
anyone who might get in my way,

even the small fry.

The cave where Bulma-san is hiding
is just a little farther that way.

This is your first time on this planet.
I'm surprised you know it so well.

What's that?! Something's
coming at incredible speed!

Hide! Hurry!

R-Right!

They're going to find us, out here
in a place like this, aren't they?

Never mind, just suppress your Ki, right now!

We'll have to leave the rest up to fate.

Is it that monstrous-looking bastard again?

Damn it, how did he figure out where we are?

Both of those powers have disappeared.

What's going on?

It happened right around there, abruptly.

Kuririn-san! Up there!

V-Vegeta! So he really is here on this planet.

How can it be that he's here?
This is a complete disaster!

He's still looking around.

He wasn't wearing one of those Scouter devices.

So how can he tell where we are?

Y-You don't think he's gained
the ability to sense Ki, do you?

If so, this is bad. Even with us suppressing our Ki,

this kid still has his slight Ki...

Damn, have I misread things?

It might be because I'm not used to
this power-sensing technique yet.

Maybe I shouldn't have destroyed that Scouter.

Hmm? I sense a small power.

This time, I'm not misreading it. Now to find it...

He's coming this way!

I-It's hopeless! He's gonna find us!

Around that rock there.

At this point, we have no choice but to fight.

Even though we know we'll get killed.

--Let's go!
--Right!

Now!

A fish, huh?

Oh, well.

Right now, getting my hands on
the two remaining Dragon Balls--

no, even just one of them, comes first.

If I can just hide one of them,

Freeza will be unable to get
all seven of them together.

Then I'll wait for Freeza and the
others to leave themselves open,

and take their five from them.

Having them lose their Scouters
means that luck is on my side!

We're saved!

I thought we'd had it for sure, there.

We sure got lucky. I've gotta
hand it to that thing in the water.

Anyhow, let's head back to where Bulma-san is,

while keeping our presence
as masked as we can.

--It's right nearby, isn't it?
--Yes.

We didn't even fight,
and I already feel exhausted.

I want to get some rest.

I'm, uh...

I'm honestly beginning to wish
we hadn't come to this planet.

I know that's not fair to the late
Yamucha-san and the others.

But far from bringing everyone back to life,

it looks like there are going
to be even more deaths.

Do you mean us?

Mm-hmm.

Look, Kuririn-san! Over there!

Oh, right, right.

Bulma-san!

Huh? She's not here.

She must be hiding further inside the cave.

Bulma-san!

It's us! Where are you?! Bulma-san!

A Capsule House!

What have you been off gallivanting around for?!

Leaving a young lady here, all by herself!

Gallivanting, she says.

Who's the small-sized
Piccolo-looking fellow there?

By any chance, is that a Namekian?

It's all right.

Eh? Did something happen?

Please, just let us come inside right now.

We'll tell you everything that happened.

Oh, right!

I just got some welcome news from my dad!

Son-kun has taken off, and is
headed here to Planet Namek!

And get this, he'll arrive in just six days!

You see, my dad took the spaceship

that Son-kun rode in on when he was
a baby and completely rebuilt it!

What's more, Son-kun is going to
undergo incredible training inside!

F-Father is coming?

--Hooray!
--Yahoo!

Undergoing incredible training, you say?

Great! Great! Now we have some hope!

Next up, this, for minutes!

I'm sensing them! Large powers!
There are at least of them!

No doubt about it, there's a
Namekian village out there!

And they probably have a Dragon Ball.

Freeza and the others don't have Scouters.

No matter what action I take now,
they won't know about it!

I knew it. The folks in this village are still alive,

which proves that Freeza and
the others haven't been here yet.

--What's this?
--An alien.

Is your elder here?

I have come to get your Dragon Ball.

W-What?!

I am the elder.

Would you mind telling me
why you want the Dragon Ball?

Never mind, just hand it over,
right now! You do have it, right?

Leave us. I cannot give it to you.

I can sense evil coming from you.

Then die.

Bang!

Elder!

Eat up. Don't be so reserved.
It's not all that great, though.

You can't blame him. Most of
his village just got killed, right?

Oh, right. This isn't really the time to eat, huh?

We don't eat this sort of thing.
We get by just drinking water.

Get out of here! There were
fields around your village,

and you were growing vegetables,
or something, weren't you?

Those were Ajissa saplings.

Ajissa saplings?

Yes. Long ago, before the climatic anomaly,

Namek was supposedly a pretty world,
dense with Ajissa trees.

But then...

...the Ajissa forests, along with us Namekians,

almost completely died out.

So now, we're increasing the
number of Ajissa trees there are,

in an attempt to make Namek beautiful again.

Say, what's your name?

Dende. Um, who are you people, exactly?

K-Kuririn-san, is that...?

What's going on, all of a sudden?
Is someone coming again?

N-No, it's not that.

There are Ki out there,
diminishing, one after another.

T-The Namekians are being killed once again.

T-The one doing the killing is
someone we know quite well.

Vegeta! He's attacking a different village now!

W-What an awful bunch those guys are!

S-Sure enough, Vegeta has
learned a technique to sense Ki.

This is a problem!

We'll have to watch how we move
around until Goku shows up.

I'm not sure if Vegeta and that
Freeza fiend are working together,

but if either one of them use the
Dragon Balls to gain eternal life,

it would be the end of the world!

If we were to find just one of
the Dragon Balls, and hide it,

they won't be able to get
all seven of them together.

We can't! if we did that,

they would keep looking, until they
had killed all of the Namekians!

O-Oh, no!

This sucks, no matter what happens.

E-Even once Goku gets here, there's
no guarantee that he can beat them.

Damn!

If only I'd finished off Vegeta when I could...

P-Please tell me more about yourselves.

Where did you come from? How do
you know about the Dragon Balls?

P-Please save the people of my world!

Why, you...! How could you do this?!

You aren't going to hand over the
Dragon Ball, no matter what, huh?

I'll be damned if I give it to you!

You are one utterly stubborn old man.

Okay, then, suit yourself. I'll find it on my own.

Wait!

Grate on me, will you?!

Here I thought it would be hidden,
but there it is, on grand display.

This Kami-sama guy was a
Namekian who had fled to Earth.

We want to use the Dragon Balls here

to bring our fallen friends back to life.

If our wish is granted right,

the Dragon Balls on Earth will return, as well.

S-So that's what's going on, is it?

I've finally unraveled the
mystery of who you are.

Please, come with me!
I will show you to the Grand Elder!

Grand Elder?

Who's the Grand Elder?

T-The one who gave birth
to all of us here on Namek.

The sole survivor of the
climatic anomaly long ago,

who has once again given vitality to Namek.

I am the Grand Elder's th child.

The sole survivor? How is it
that you folks have children?

How? We lay eggs out of our mouths.

Oh, is that right? That's unusual, huh?

S-So then, the Grand Elder is a female, right?

Female? What's a female?

W-What is it? There are two kinds of
Namekians, right? Male and female.

Let's see, for example... you have
your father, and then your mother.

Two kinds? N-No...

Did you hear that? They don't
have males and females.

What a dull planet. I'm glad I'm not Namekian.

Er, never mind that, tell us,

why are we going to the Grand Elder's place?

The people who attacked our village
already had four Dragon Balls.

A-And you said a lot of people were just k*lled

over in that direction, right?

Y-Yeah, probably by a guy named Vegeta.

There isn't a single Ki remaining there.

They were probably completely wiped out.

In that case, there aren't very many
Namekians left on this world.

R-Right. if Vegeta found the
Dragon Ball in the village he attacked,

that means there's only one left.

By any chance, does the
Grand Elder have the last one?

Y-Yes.

Oh, no!

Freeza may have lost his Scouters,

but Vegeta has gained
the ability to search for Ki!

If he searches for his Ki,

he'll arrive at the Grand
Elder's place before long,

and steal the seventh Dragon Ball from him!

T-Then we have to let the
Grand Elder know at once!

I beg you! I beg you!

If either Freeza or Vegeta
are granted eternal life,

it would be awful!

All right. Let's hurry. Show me the way.

Right!

I'll go see the Grand Elder with Dende.

Gohan, you and Bulma-san wait here for me.

There's no point in all of us going, is there?!

All right. Be careful.

Remember, Gohan, you guys be careful, too!

Right!

Now then...

if I submerge this Dragon Ball here,
no one will be able to find it.

I'm the only one who knows it's here.

Freeza and the others have five Dragon Balls.

I guess I'll go look for the last one.

Dodoria is far too late in returning.

Could he still be pursuing those unusual runts?

Never mind.

If the fool cannot catch those
two kids, then leave him be.

Never mind him, go and find
the last two Dragon Balls.

Yes, sir, as you wish. if we
search the remaining villages,

the Dragon Balls are sure to be there.

With the two of us searching,

we should at least be able to find their villages.

Then, I shall take these five Dragon Balls,

and wait for you back at the spaceship.

I am counting on you.

Once we have just two more of them,
I can have my wish granted.

Yes, sir.

You look over in that direction.

If you find a village, do nothing,
and come let me know.

If there are any strong Namekians,
you won't be able to handle them.

We'll meet up again in three hours,
back at the spaceship.

Yes, sir.

It could be that Vegeta has already
located the two that remain.

Even so, he will likely be
coming after our Dragon Balls.

That could be good, and save us
the bother of having to find him.

Once Vegeta comes after them,

we will turn the tables,
and take his two from him.

By doing so, we shall have
all seven of them together.

And then I shall be given eternal life.

Now then,

to wait at my leisure in the spaceship.

Vegeta seems to have grown
even stronger than before.

And I sensed an even stronger
Ki from that Freeza guy.

I don't know what kind of
training Goku is going through,

but this time, even he might
not be able to handle them.

In any case, let's get the Dragon
Ball that the Grand Elder has,

and hide for the five and a half
days it will take for Goku to arrive.

After that, all we can do is wait
for Goku to work a miracle.

If I'm getting so I'm expecting
miracles, it's all over, huh?

Tch, I didn't have any female
presence in my life at all.

Vegeta had successfully seized a Dragon Ball.

In order to protect the last one,

Kuririn and Dende rush to the Grand Elder.

Elsewhere, the other five Dragon Balls
have fallen into Freeza's hands.

Dragon Soul!

"Friends Reborn! The Beautiful Warrior
Zarbon's Devilish Transformation."

All right... good...

I've gotten pretty accustomed
to -times gravity.

Now, how about I try -times?

Goku! Do you hear me? Goku! Huh?

Hmm? Ah, that voice! Is that you, Kaio-sama?

Yeah, it's Kaio, all right.

You're not, by any chance, in space, are you?

What are you doing in space?

Oh, I see. Planet Namek, right?

I hope you do find Dragon Balls there.

What, you didn't know, Kaio-sama?

There's something terrible
happening on Planet Namek.

Something terrible? Well,
you can tell me about it later.

As it turns out, I've had some visitors come by.

Visitors? What about them?

It's incredible! These visitors
traveled the Serpentine Road

and arrived here in far less time than you did.

What's more, there are four of them.

--Four of them?
--That's right.

And I'm sure you know these four quite well.

I-It couldn't be!

They all want to receive training
even more strenuous than you got.

T-That's awesome!

You mean they all arrived at
your place together, Kaio-sama?

May I speak to Goku?

Place your hand on my shoulder, and then talk.

Yo, do you hear me, Goku?

Yamucha!

We met the departed
Kami-sama in the Next World,

and he told us about this place.

Hey, we heard that you are
going to Piccolo's homeworld,

to look for the Dragon Balls,

so that you can bring us back to life.

You said there were four of you, right?

Yamucha, Tenshinhan... and is
Piccolo there, by any chance?

Yeah, Piccolo's here, too.

Hmph, my pride wouldn't allow

for you to be the only one who got stronger.

Who is the other one? Is it Kami-sama?

No, not him. Kami-sama
stayed in the Next World.

Get this, it's Chaozu!

Chaozu?! But Chaozu got
blown to pieces. Is he all right?

Yeah. Kami-sama regenerated
a body, especially for him.

That's awesome! Good for you, Chaozu!

I'll tell you, though, the gravity here has us beat.

Our bodies are so heavy,
we can't even run properly.

Yeah, I know, I know.

But right now, I'm headed
for this Planet Namek place,

which has the Dragon Balls,

and I've started training under
much, much more intense gravity.

I have to get much stronger in
the next five and a half days,

or there's gonna be real big trouble.

Eh? What do you mean? What happened?

I was severely injured,
so Kuririn, Bulma and Gohan

went to Planet Namek to
look for the Dragon Balls.

But once they got there, that Saiyan, Vegeta,

was also there looking for the Dragon Balls.

--What?!
--S-So then, did they get
themselves k*lled by him?!

No, it looks like Vegeta still ain't realized

that Kuririn and the others are there.

But that ain't all, either.

There's something else, even more unbelievable.

There are apparently some other
strange folks after the Dragon Balls.

The weird thing is, their
outfits are just like Vegeta's.

What's more, one of them has
a Ki far higher than Vegeta's.

W-What?!

What? What's going on?

By any chance, is his name Freeza?

I don't know. I ain't heard,
but when I find out, I'll tell you.

If it is Freeza, this is a huge problem.

G-Goku, I'm going to look in on Planet Namek.

Please do, Kaio-sama!

Let's see, which direction is Planet Namek...?

Yamucha, tell us what's going on.

I-I do sense an enormous amount of Ki, all right.

Checking to see where this Ki is coming from...

Wha--?

Freeza!

What's this? Kaio-sama, you know who it is?

Goku, this time around,
your opponent is too much for you.

Or I should say, he's the worst of the worst!

There is no way you can handle this guy!

What do you mean?

Listen to me, Goku. This is
an order! Do not go near him!

Once you get to Planet Namek,
take the other three aboard,

and run away, immediately!

I'm not just saying this for your sake.

I'm saying this for Earth, Planet
Namek, and all the other worlds.

If you launch a half-baked attack
on him, and get him angry,

something horrific will happen!

Leaving him alone is the only thing you can do!

Is he really all that great?
I'd kinda like to see him.

Don't you dare go near him!

--Yeah, but...
--No buts about it!

Goku, do whatever you have to
to gather the Dragon Balls,

and bring us back to life.

Piccolo!

I'm going to improve myself
here even more than you did,

and go to Planet Namek.

Together, we'll send that absurd
what's-his-name bastard flying.

D-Don't be ridiculous! You guys
don't know a thing about Freeza!

There's no time. Start training us, right away.

If you're planning to fight Freeza,
I won't teach you anything!

Promise me that you won't go to Planet Namek.

All right.

You mean that, right? I'm trusting you.

That goes for you guys, too!

There's no way I'm going to
keep a measly promise like that.

If I do the same training that Goku did,

I won't be able to surpass him.

I'll have to work out the key points of the training,

and then hone my techniques on my own.

All right, then, let's get started.

Here we go...

Let's do this!

First off,

try to make me laugh with a pun.

I will train whoever can pass this test!

Even if I can't take any action,

there ain't no harm in getting stronger.

All right, let's try kicking it all
the way up to -times gravity!

Hey, if we keep flying at this rate,

when will we reach the Grand Elder's place?

W-We should make it in another five hours.

Damn, I can't find anyplace that has
multiple powers gathered together.

What does this mean?
Are there no more villages?

There are two powers on the move.

Strange. One of them feels different

from both Freeza's men and the Namekians.

It's disconcerting. I think I'll go check it out.

Stop, Dende!

It's Vegeta! He's taken notice of us, all right!

He's headed straight this
way at tremendous speed!

We have to hide, now!

Huh?

W-What happened? He changed direction.

There's another large Ki out there!
He went in that direction!

This power belongs to Zarbon!
No doubt about it!

I've been waiting for him
to make a move on his own!

If only I had a Scouter,
finding a village would be easy.

That's... Vegeta!

Yo! it's been quite a long while,
hasn't it, Zarbon-san?

I've already disposed of Dodoria.
Now it's your turn.

What?! Y-You've disposed of Dodoria?

Easily.

I don't believe it.

You'll be able to tell once we go at it.
I'll show you how strong I am.

Vegeta, why would you
turn against Freeza-sama?

That's simple. I never have
liked that Freeza bastard.

Up to now, I've been forced
into submission by his power,

and had no choice but to do as he said,

but now, by an odd turn of events,

I've learned that I can gain eternal life.

You're talking about the Dragon Balls.

I'm not about to let Freeza have them!

Once eternal life is mine,

I'm sure the chance to beat
Freeza will come along.

What foolishness.

Do you think eternal life is
all you need to beat Freeza?

It's a shame you don't have your Scouter.

By fighting many battles,

I've increased my power
more than you can imagine.

You're the one who doesn't understand.

Freeza-sama's power far
transcends even that level.

That's enough of your mindless babbling!

I heard from Dodoria that
Freeza was afraid of Saiyans!

I'm going to show you some
Saiyan power, right now!

You've got such a swelled head.

What Freeza-sama was afraid of
was the Saiyans banding together.

Just one of you can't do anything.

Well, we'll see about that.

What?!

To think that he could deflect that!

Incredible! it's Ki slamming against Ki!

Vegeta and someone else are mixing it up.

H-His opponent is probably that
guy who was at Freeza's side.

Both of them are monsters.
There's no way I can compete with them.

Let's just hope the two of them
end up crushing each other.

All right! Hold on to me tight!

This is our chance!
While those two are battling it out,

we're going to rush to the Grand Elder!

If I fly all-out, we should reach there quickly!

Here we go!

What's the matter?!

For someone as fast as the great Zarbon-sama,

you look like you're standing still!

What?!

To think that you'd be so helpless at this level!

You surprise me. You have indeed
made outstanding progress.

However, as a result, you have
awakened my true power,

which has lain dormant for many years.

What? Your true power, which has
lain dormant for many years?

Are you saying you've got such a thing?

That is correct.

That's a hilarious joke!

Before you die, I will tell you

why I have let my true power remain dormant.

In order to display my
true power, I must transform.

However, my transformed
appearance is quite ugly.

As someone who prefers beauty, I cannot bear it.

But I would rather choose to
transform than choose death.

Transform, you say? The way we Saiyans do?

People who are backed into a corner

will say the most ridiculous
things out of desperation.

Hmph, I do not become unnecessarily
large, like you Saiyans do.

My power just increases.

Overwhelmingly so!

Hey, it seems like a lot of time has gone by

since we got to this planet,

but the sun shows no sign
of going down. Why is that?

The sun doesn't go down.

I mean, there are three suns,
and they all come up in turn.

So then, there's no such
thing as night on your world?

No, there isn't.

Well, okay then.

Let me see it.

You don't even need to ask.
I'll show you, right now!

W-What is this?!

My appearance isn't all that's transformed!

Get a load of my power now!

Hey, Dende, are we almost at
the Grand Elder's house yet?

It's just a little farther ahead.

We have to do something while
Vegeta and that other guy fight.

Damn it, I will not be beaten!

No matter how you struggle,
you cannot beat me!

Incredible! Even as far away as we are,

I can feel the Ki from their battle!

My power before I transformed
doesn't compare to what I have now!

It's no use. I thought I had
powered up on Earth, but...

You're not going to get an easy death!

Vegeta, have you met your end?

He's not showing himself. it would
seem that he was unable to move,

and ended up drowning.

Hmph, he put me to a lot of trouble.

He even made me perform
my hated transformation.

Now then, I suppose I should
report this to Freeza-sama.

Z-Zarbon! This isn't over yet!

I-I will become much, much stronger!

And then I will defeat both Zarbon and Freeza!

I-I won't let anyone have the Dragon Balls!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Resurrected Companions! The Beauty Soldier Zarbon's Demon Transformation"
  

All right... good...

I've gotten pretty accustomed
to 20-times gravity.

Now, how about I try 30-times?

Goku! Do you hear me? Goku! Huh?

Hmm? Ah, that voice! Is that you, Kaio-sama?

Yeah, it's Kaio, all right.

You're not, by any chance, in space, are you?

What are you doing in space?

Oh, I see. Planet Namek, right?

I hope you do find Dragon Balls there.

What, you didn't know, Kaio-sama?

There's something terrible
happening on Planet Namek.

Something terrible? Well,
you can tell me about it later.

No, not him. Kami-sama

Get this, it's Chaozu!

Chaozu?! But Chaozu got
blown to pieces. Is he all right?

Yeah. Kami-sama regenerated
a body, especially for him.

That's awesome! Good for you, Chaozu!

I'll tell you, though, the gravity here has us beat.

Our bodies are so heavy,

If only I had a Scouter,
finding a village would be easy.

That's... Vegeta!

Yo! it's been quite a long while,
hasn't it, Zarbon-san?

I've already disposed of Dodoria.
Now it's your turn.

What?! Y-You've disposed of Dodoria?

Easily.

I don't believe it.

You'll be able to tell once we go at it.
I'll show you how strong I am.

Vegeta, why would you
turn against Freeza-sama?

That's simple. I never have
liked that Freeza bastard.

Up to now, I've been forced
into submission by his power,

and had no choice but to do as he said,

but now, by an odd turn of events,

I've learned that I can gain eternal life.

You're talking about the Dragon Balls.

I'm not about to let Freeza have them!

Once eternal life is mine,

I'm sure the chance to beat
Freeza will come along.

What foolishness.

Do you think eternal life is
all you need to beat Freeza?

It's a shame you don't have your Scouter.

By fighting many battles,

I've increased my power
more than you can imagine.

You're the one who doesn't understand.

Freeza-sama's power far
transcends even that level.

That's enough of your mindless babbling!

I heard from Dodoria that
Freeza was afraid of Saiyans!

I'm going to show you some
Saiyan power, right now!

You've got such a swelled head.

What Freeza-sama was afraid of
was the Saiyans banding together.

Just one of you can't do anything.

Well, we'll see about that.

What?!

To think that he could deflect that!

Incredible! it's Ki slamming against Ki!

Vegeta and someone else are mixing it up.

H-His opponent is probably that
guy who was at Freeza's side.

Both of them are monsters.
There's no way I can compete with them.

Let's just hope the two of them
end up crushing each other.

All right! Hold on to me tight!

This is our chance!
While those two are battling it out,

we're going to rush to the Grand Elder!

If I fly all-out, we should reach there quickly!

Here we go!

What's the matter?!

For someone as fast as the great Zarbon-sama,

you look like you're standing still!

What?!

To think that you'd be so helpless at this level!

You surprise me. You have indeed
made outstanding progress.

However, as a result, you have
awakened my true power,

which has lain dormant for many years.

What? Your true power, which has
lain dormant for many years?

Are you saying you've got such a thing?

That is correct.

That's a hilarious joke!

Before you die, I will tell you

why I have let my true power remain dormant.

In order to display my
true power, I must transform.

However, my transformed
appearance is quite ugly.

As someone who prefers beauty, I cannot bear it.

But I would rather choose to
transform than choose death.

Transform, you say? The way we Saiyans do?

People who are backed into a corner

will say the most ridiculous
things out of desperation.

Hmph, I do not become unnecessarily
large, like you Saiyans do.

My power just increases.

Overwhelmingly so!

Hey, it seems like a lot of time has gone by

since we got to this planet,

but the sun shows no sign
of going down. Why is that?

The sun doesn't go down.

I mean, there are three suns,
and they all come up in turn.

So then, there's no such
thing as night on your world?

No, there isn't.

Well, okay then.

Let me see it.

You don't even need to ask.
I'll show you, right now!

W-What is this?!

My appearance isn't all that's transformed!

Get a load of my power now!

Hey, Dende, are we almost at
the Grand Elder's house yet?

It's just a little farther ahead.

We have to do something while
Vegeta and that other guy fight.

Damn it, I will not be beaten!

No matter how you struggle,
you cannot beat me!

Incredible! Even as far away as we are,

I can feel the Ki from their battle!

My power before I transformed
doesn't compare to what I have now!

It's no use. I thought I had
powered up on Earth, but...

You're not going to get an easy death!

Vegeta, have you met your end?

He's not showing himself. it would
seem that he was unable to move,

and ended up drowning.

Hmph, he put me to a lot of trouble.

He even made me perform
my hated transformation.

Now then, I suppose I should
report this to Freeza-sama.

Z-Zarbon! This isn't over yet!

I-I will become much, much stronger!

And then I will defeat both Zarbon and Freeza!

I-I won't let anyone have the Dragon Balls!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Kuririn's Power-Up! The Foreboding Squirming of Freeza"
  


There it is. You can see that tall rock there, right?

That's it?

That was a long way.

The Grand Elder is inside that house.

I'm surprised it's still here.
As conspicuous as this place is,

it's only a matter of time
before the bad guys find it.

He hasn't been done in already, right?

He couldn't be...

Nail-san! Thank goodness! You're all right, then!

H-He looks just like Piccolo!

I'm glad you made it here, Dende, and the visitor.

The Grand Elder already knows
the gist of what's going on.

Then the Grand Elder sees what is happening?

That saves us the trouble
of explaining everything.

Both of you, come inside.
The Grand Elder will see you.

U-Um, if you already know
roughly what is going on,

w-why haven't you left such
a dangerous place as this?

The Grand Elder has grown too old.
He knows that his death is near.

There was nothing else we could do

but let him remain here while I protect him.

I'd heard he was near his end,
but I didn't know it was so serious.

Come, inside.

This guy can handle himself.

Compared to the other Namekians,
I sense remarkable power from him.

Up above.

Right.

Grand Elder, Dende, and a visitor.

H-He's huge!

Welcome. You are an earthling, right?

First, I would like to express my
gratitude for saving my child, Dende.

Thank you.

Er, not at all. I-l wasn't able to do all that much.

Whoa...!

I'm maxed out... I've gotta rest for a bit...

Still, I've mastered -times gravity
a lot sooner than I thought.

Looks like my duel with Vegeta
wasn't entirely for nothing, huh?

Because of those villains,

most of my children on
this world have been k*lled.

It grieves me.

They seem to be after the
Dragon Balls, don't they?

Yes.

I never imagined that those globes of hope,

a testament to the wisdom
and power of the Namekians,

would bring this about.

Forgive me for coming right to the point,

but could I ask you to let me
borrow that Dragon Ball

above your head for a short while?

I will never give it to those guys. I promise.

You are collecting the Dragon Balls, too, are you?

Yes. I want to bring my fallen friends back to life.

I would like to request it, as well.

Grand Elder, if these people's
friends return to life,

they might be able to put down those evil men.

How do you know about the Dragon Balls?

We had them on Earth, as well.

You what?!

Long ago, during the crisis on this world,

there was a Namekian who fled to Earth.

He created our Dragon Balls.

Ah, yes, I remember now.
That was the child of Katattsu.

What a surprise. To think that
he safely arrived on Earth.

He was a gifted Dragon-type child,
who could create Dragon Balls.

He was also killed,
along with the rest of our friends,

by a Saiyan named Vegeta, who has come here.

The Saiyans are indeed formidable.
That poor child prodigy...

That Saiyan wouldn't happen
to be a Super Saiyan, would he?

W-What is that?

G-Gentleman from Earth,
could I ask you to come over here?

Sure...

Please allow me to explore
a little of Earth's past.

P-Past?

Oh, my goodness! Evil entered into him,
and his body was split into two.

So in order for him to become Kami,

he could not have even
the slightest evil sentiment.

As a result, the evil Piccolo was born.

However, it is a pity.

Imagine, him halving his
prodigious inborn powers like that.

If he had become one again,
like he originally was,

he may have made it through without dying.

O-One again?

Well, I suppose it's all right.
Your desires are pure, after all.

Your courage up to now is greatly esteemed.

I shall give you this Dragon Ball.

Terrific!

Thank you very much.

So this is an original Dragon Ball.

It sure is big.

However, your wish is not likely to be granted.

Why not?

Unfortunately, my life will
only last a few more days.

Can you steal the balls

already gathered by those villains in that time?

More than likely, it will be
quite impossible. Once I die...

Grand Elder!

...the Dragon Balls will also be extinguished.

It's all right! We have no choice!

For the time being, I will protect
this Dragon Ball with my life!

It's far better than letting those
guys have eternal life, after all.

If you'd be so kind. I no longer
have the strength to protect it.

I'll make sure to!

You possess exceptional power.

It's a shame you still have
so much power left dormant.

Dormant power?

Allow me to release that power.

No way, I couldn't have that kind of power left.

I've trained quite extensively, after all...

Even now, I'm beyond my limits!

Please find a way to somehow
escape their clutches.

The power... the power...!

The power is starting to gush forth!

Incredible!

U-Unbelievable! it feels like I've been reborn!

Thank you very much!

U-Um... can you call forth anyone's power?

Like say, from a small child?

It is possible for anyone, as long
as they have dormant power.

If you do this too much, will it shorten your life?

All I do is provide the trigger.

It has nothing to do with my lifespan.

W-Would it be all right if I brought
another one of my friends here?

He's sure to have an enormous
amount of dormant power.

Then bring him here.

The more powerful people we have
on the side of right, the better.

Right! I will bring him here right away!

U-Um, what about this?

Please take it with you.

I leave the future of this world,
and the universe, in your hands.

Dende, you wait here.
I'll be right back with Gohan.

P-Please be careful.

Mm-hmm.

This is awesome! Who'd have
thought I had this kind of power?

I should be able to pick up Gohan
in just a few hours like this!

H-How can this be?

A village that we haven't attacked
yet has already been wiped out!

If I submerge this Dragon Ball here,
no one will be able to find it.

I have to get that Dragon Ball
back, no matter what...

What happened? Who did this to you?

T-The Saiyan took our Dragon Ball...

it was Vegeta, all right.

T-The Dragon Ball...

Die already, will you?

Freeza-sama, it is Zarbon.

Enter.

Did you find a village?

No. As of this moment,
I have not found any villages,

but I did defeat Vegeta.

Ho, did you? Then Zarbon-san, you transformed?

The first time in a long while?

--Yes, sir.
--So, is Vegeta dead?

Well, I did not exactly check for his corpse,

but if, by some slim chance, he is still alive,

he would be gravely injured.

Why did you not confirm that he was dead?!

W-Well, Vegeta was
submerged under the water, so...

You could have gone under the water, correct?

You failed to confirm that he was
dead because you dislike getting wet.

Also, you were rash to have killed
him right away in the first place.

What if Vegeta has concealed a
Dragon Ball from us someplace?

I-I am terribly sorry. I will go check at once.

Freeza-sama!

I have discovered a village!

H-However, the village has
already been wiped out!

What did you say?

I think it was most likely the work of Vegeta.

Then he does have a
Dragon Ball somewhere after all!

There was one villager still alive,
but I disposed of him at once.

Then you k*lled our one and only witness?

S-Sir...?

I dislike hasty, unwise
actions more than anything.

If Vegeta is dead, then you had
better prepare yourself, as well.

Bring Vegeta back here at once.

This time, you should set your
hopes on him being alive.

Appule!

Yes, sir?

Contact Planet Freeza,

and inform the Ginyu Special Corps
that they are to report here.

And needless to say, tell them
to bring Scouters, as well.

They should arrive in five days.

Understood!

F-Freeza-sama, why bring in
the Ginyu Special Corps?

Forgive me for saying so,

but I believe that there is
absolutely no reason to call them in.

I am getting an unusual foreboding.

W-What kind of foreboding?

I have considered this for a little while now,

but I have gotten the feeling that
a powerful Saiyan has grown up,

who will become my enemy in time.

At first, I thought it was Vegeta,
but it would seem that I am wrong.

A-Are you sure you aren't imagining things?

As far as Saiyans go, except for Vegeta,

there is only that what's-his-name
on Earth, and his son.

And their battle powers are
supposed to be lower than Vegeta's.

Are you telling me that
my foreboding is misplaced?

--N-No, sir!
--Never mind that.

I would like you to bring
Vegeta back here at once.

Y-Yes, sir!

The Ginyu Special Corps...

Saiyans do indeed appear to
possess fathomless battle power.

Every time they battle, it rises greatly.

Of course, they are no match for me,

but thinking ahead to the future,

I have to nip this in the bud now, while I can.

It would be most inopportune if
one of them became a Super Saiyan.

I slept pretty good. I wonder
how long I was asleep.

It's no use! I'm so worn out, I can't move at all!

Damn it...

I am not... going to die...!

W-What's this? He's still alive?

You're a tough one.

But then, this time, it's because
you're tough that I'll be spared.

We're going to treat you. You're lucky.

Say, Gohan-kun, look at this!

One of the Dragon Balls started moving.

It's coming straight toward us.

Could that be Kuririn-kun?

That must be it! Hooray!

I'm sure he saw the Grand Elder, and got his ball!

Hold on a second. Then what
is this other one, here?

These five here are probably the
ones that that Freeza guy has, right?

But look, there's one right here, all alone.

Huh? You're right, and it's close to here.

Let's see... in that direction, right?

We said that Vegeta was
attacking a village, remember?

It's in that direction!

B-But Vegeta isn't there.

I can't sense his Ki.

I get it! He attacked the village,

but wasn't able to find the Dragon Ball!

Mm-hmm.

He must have figured it wasn't there,
and went off someplace else.

Please let me borrow the Radar.
I'm going to go get that Dragon Ball.

Way to go! We caught a bit of luck, ourselves!

--Well?
--His condition is quite serious, sir.

His vital signs are extremely weak,

and even if he completely
recovers from his injuries,

I can't be sure he'll ever regain consciousness.

Bring him around, no matter what it takes!

Do everything possible for him! Got it?!

Y-Yes, sir.

Otherwise, it will mean my life.

Great, great! Now's my chance!

I don't sense the Ki of anyone scary nearby!


Dragon Ball Z Kai 


The Conspiracy Completely Shatters! Vegeta's Counterattack vs. Zarbon" 
  


You've taken quite a bit of damage.

This could take a while.

Come on. if you don't regain consciousness,

I'm the one that Freeza is gonna take it out on.

That should do it. Now I just
have to wait until you wake up.

How is Vegeta?

Sir, he should be regaining
consciousness shortly.

That is good, is it not?

Y-Yes, sir.

W-What was that explosion?!

It cannot be...!

Looks like you underestimated
my recuperative ability.

Now then...

Damn! it came from the
treatment room, all right!

Zarbon-san, quickly!

Oh, no! He fled outside!

He did what?!

Good! Freeza is with him!

Quickly! Quickly, go after him!

W-Why, you...!

Quickly! Find him no matter what!
He could not have gotten very far!

Fools. You fell for that all too easily.

Dear Freeza-sama,

Right now, as of this moment,
your reign is at an end.

Your beloved Vegeta.

I win!

Let's see...

it's around here.

H-How awful.

I'm sure Vegeta must have done this.

Where are you? Where are you?!

Where did you run off to, Vegeta?!

He couldn't have gotten away that quickly.

He must be hiding somewhere.

You still have not found him, Zarbon-san?!

If you have the nerve to allow him
to get away from you like this,

you will die to take responsibility.

Fool! Keep searching around outside all you like!

One... two... three... four...

All five of them are here, all right.

They didn't just heal my injuries,

they're going to have every
last one of their Dragon Balls

stolen by me, as well.

But I can't get away cleanly
carrying all five of them.

What's more, I don't have much time to think.

All right...

Please, let this work!

Hey! You fell for it! I'm still inside the ship!

--Wha...?
--He's what?!

D-Damn him!

Now!

Where is Vegeta?!

D-Do not tell me that Vegeta
is after the Dragon Balls!

All right! Now for me!

T-The Dragon Balls!

T-That bastard!

W-Where is he this time?!

F-Freeza-sama, could he
still be inside the spaceship?

Find him!

Y-Yes, sir!

If I were to foolishly flee by air,

Freeza would catch up to me in no time.

What a disgrace!

Not only did you let Vegeta escape,
but he has the Dragon Balls, too!

There is no way he could have escaped
in a flash carrying all five Dragon Balls!

I shall search inside the spaceship.

You will thoroughly look around outside!

--Yes, sir.
--L trust you are ready to answer for this.

If one hour passes, and you are
unable to bring Vegeta back here...

Y-Yes, sir...

Huh? This way?

Not inside one of the houses?

I get it! Not even Vegeta would
have found it inside the lake.

I did it!

Here it is, here it is!

I'm sure they must have
landed around here somewhere.

There they are! There they are!

Outstanding control, if I do say so myself!

Take that, Freeza!

I've finally gotten his Dragon Balls!

Now, if you include the one I sunk by that village,

I only need one more to have all seven!

There's a strong battle power...! Is that Zarbon?!

No, it's not. The battle power
is lower than Zarbon's.

I-Is that...?

Just you wait, Gohan! Once you
go to the Grand Elder's place,

you'll become much, much stronger!

It's that earthling!

W-What's he doing on Planet Namek?

What's more, he was
carrying the last Dragon Ball.

Luck is on my side from top to bottom!

That was fast! I'm almost there!

It looks like that earthling is
after the Dragon Balls, too.

But I will be taking the one you're carrying!

Now I'll have all seven of the Dragon Balls!

D-Damn it, Vegeta! Where are you?!

If only I had a Scouter,
it would be easy to find you!

The way things are going, my life
will be forfeit to Freeza-sama.

Ls that Vegeta?!

No. That's the guy who came to
the rescue of that Namekian kid.

But he's carrying what looks like a Dragon Ball.

Vegeta!

I've found you at last! You're all mine now!

There's a tremendous battle power following me.

Looks like Zarbon found me.

Tch, what a pesky bastard.

Still, this is a good opportunity.
I'll put him away for sure this time.

He's completely heartened by
our last battle. He'll be off guard.

Huh?

It's you, Kuririn-kun! Don't startle me!

T-This is dangerous, isn't it, Bulma-san?

If you stay outside,
casually reading a book like that,

they're going to spot you.

What are you talking about?! if I stay
inside the cave the whole time...

I-Is that, by any chance, a Dragon Ball?

Bingo!

The home-soil Dragon Balls are huge, aren't they?

The Grand Elder was quite reasonable.

Oh, right, right! Bulma-san,
is Gohan inside the house?

I want to take him to see the Grand Elder, too.

He went to go find another Dragon Ball.

It showed up on the Radar.

Near that village that
Vegeta attacked, remember?

Really?

A-A Ki! it's headed this way, and it's almost here!

It's Gohan-kun! That was fast, huh?

No, it's not Gohan!

V-Vegeta!

Crap! I was so carried away
with becoming stronger,

I didn't notice his Ki!

I wouldn't have expected to
meet you here, earthlings.

I didn't think you had the technology it took

to travel to this planet.

Judging by the Dragon Ball
you're so delicately holding,

it would seem that we have the same objective.

Listen up. Before I take that Ball from you,

there's something I have to do.

But you'd better not get any funny ideas,

like taking that and running away with it.

It won't be just you that dies,
but the woman, as well.

So, you're here.

W-Who is that guy? Judging from his face,

I wonder if he isn't our knight in shining armor.

N-No way...

T-This is as bad as it gets!

What's as bad as it gets? He's a
pretty fine-looking man, isn't he?

Please don't go judging people by
their appearances at a time like this!

But usually, the hunk is the good guy.

This is not Earth, it's Planet Namek.

I know that.

Bulma-san, you don't understand anything.

You've done quite a job
of mocking me, Vegeta-san.

I see. I also recognize that little
runt holding the Dragon Ball.

You guys are together, are you?

Yoo-hoo!

Yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo!
Stick it to Vegeta, okay?

Hmph, yeah, right.

It doesn't matter to me.

Vegeta, where did you hide
the remaining Dragon Ball?

I'm going to bring you before
Freeza-sama, and make you tell us.

Just try it.

You'll never learn.

Don't you mess with me!

If this keeps up...

Hmph, you're finally getting into it, huh?

He's a bad guy, all right!

W-What is this?! He turned into a monster!

And what's more, his power shot up like crazy!

You fell for it, Zarbon!

Damn it!

Bulma-san, now's our chance!
Let's get out of here!

But he said he'd kill us if we ran!

We'll be killed if we don't run! Hurry!

Oh, no you don't!

Damn! Nothing gets past him!

I'm sensing two incredible Ki!

They're coming from where
Bulma-san is waiting for me!

Vegeta, how dare you...?

Looks like that took quite a toll.

Your strength has dropped
considerably, hasn't it?

Zarbon-san, your death
would appear to be at hand.

My death is near?

Don't make me laugh! My battle
power is higher than yours!

Zarbon-san, I thought you were supposed to be

well acquainted with Saiyans, weren't you?

You were wrong to have carelessly treated me

after I came close to dying. isn't that right?

Every time a Saiyan recovers
after being near death,

they are able to rapidly raise their battle power.

So that's it. Come to think of it,

Goku also got stronger after each intense battle.

Damn, so that's why
Vegeta's Ki rose so much, is it?

I don't care how much you've
raised your battle power,

there's no way you can beat
me when I'm transformed,

and am able to exhibit my true power!

The Saiyans are a warrior race!
Don't mess with us!

V-Vegeta... I-I was just
following Freeza-sama's orders...

Let me go... p-please...

After all the time you've
spent pushing me around,

don't you dare go asking anything for yourself!

I-I know... Let's team up together...

if we do that, we could beat even Freeza...!
