WELCOME TO 
DEAD HOUSE

Josh and I hated our new house. 

Sure, it was big. It looked like a mansion compared to our old house. It 
was a tall redbrick house with a sloping black roof and rows of windows 
framed by black shutters. 

It’s so dark, I thought, studying it from the street. The whole house 
was covered in darkness, as if it were hiding in the shadows of the gnarled, 
old trees that bent over it. 

It was the middle of July, but dead brown leaves blanketed the front 
yard. Our sneakers crunched over them as we tmdged up the gravel 
driveway. 

Tall weeds poked up everywhere through the dead leaves. Thick 
clumps of weeds had completely overgrown an old flower bed beside the 
front porch. 

This house is creepy, I thought unhappily. 

Josh must have been thinking the same thing. Looking up at the old 
house, we both groaned loudly. 

Mr. Dawes, the friendly young man from the local real estate office, 
stopped near the front walk and turned around. 

“Everything okay?” he asked, staring first at Josh, then at me, with his 
crinkly blue eyes. 

“Josh and Amanda aren’t happy about moving,” Dad explained, 
tucking his shirttail in. Dad is a little overweight, and his shirts always seem 
to be coming untucked. 

“It’s hard for kids,” my mother added, smiling at Mr. Dawes, her hands 
shoved into her jeans pockets as she continued up to the front door. “You 
know. Leaving all of their friends behind. Moving to a strange new place.” 

“Strange is right,” Josh said, shaking his head. “This house is gross.” 

Mr. Dawes chuckled. “It’s an old house, that’s for sure,” he said, 
patting Josh on the shoulder. 

“It just needs some work, Josh,” Dad said, smiling at Mr. Dawes. “No 
one has lived in it for a while, so it’ll take some fixing up.” 

“Look how big it is,” Mom added, smoothing back her straight black 



hair and smiling at Josh. “We’ll have room for a den and maybe a rec room, 
too. You’d like that—wouldn’t you, Amanda?” 

I shrugged. A cold breeze made me shiver. It was actually a beautiful, 
hot summer day. But the closer we got to the house, the colder I felt. 

I guessed it was because of all the tall, old trees. 

I was wearing white tennis shorts and a sleeveless blue T-shirt. It had 
been hot in the car. But now I was freezing. Maybe it’ll be warmer in the 
house, I thought. 

“How old are they?” Mr. Dawes asked Mom, stepping onto the front 
porch. 

“Amanda is twelve,” Mom answered. “And Josh turned eleven last 
month.” 

“They look so much alike,” Mr. Dawes told Mom. 

I couldn’t decide if that was a compliment or not. I guess it’s true. Josh 
and I are both tall and thin and have curly brown hair like Dad’s, and dark 
brown eyes. Everyone says we have “serious” faces. 

“I really want to go home,” Josh said, his voice cracking. “I hate this 
place.” 

My brother is the most impatient kid in the world. And when he makes 
up his mind about something, that’s it. He’s a little spoiled. At least, I think 
so. Whenever he makes a big fuss about something, he usually gets his way. 

We may look alike, but we’re really not that similar. I’m a lot more 
patient than Josh is. A lot more sensible. Probably because I’m older and 
because I’m a girl. 

Josh had hold of Dad’s hand and was trying to pull him back to the car. 
“Let’s go. Come on, Dad. Let’s go.” 

I knew this was one time Josh wouldn’t get his way. We were moving 
to this house. No doubt about it. After all, the house was absolutely free. A 
great-uncle of Dad’s, a man we didn’t even know, had died and left the 
house to Dad in his will. 

I’ll never forget the look on Dad’s face when he got the letter from the 
lawyer. He let out a loud whoop and began dancing around the living room. 
Josh and I thought he’d flipped or something. 

“My Great-Uncle Charles has left us a house in his will,” Dad 
explained, reading and rereading the letter. “It’s in a town called Dark 
Palls.” 



“Huh?” Josh and I cried. “Where’s Dark Falls?” 

Dad shrugged. 

“I don’t remember your Uncle Charles,” Mom said, moving behind 
Dad to read the letter over his shoulder. 

“Neither do I,” admitted Dad. “But he must’ve been a great guy! 
Wow! This sounds like an incredible house!” He grabbed Mom’s hands and 
began dancing happily with her across the living room. 

Dad sure was excited. He’d been looking for an excuse to quit his 
boring office job and devote all of his time to his writing career. This house 
—absolutely free—would be just the excuse he needed. 

And now, a week later, here we were in Dark Falls, a four-hour drive 
from our home, seeing our new house for the first time. We hadn’t even 
gone inside, and Josh was trying to drag Dad back to the car. 

“Josh—stop pulling me,” Dad snapped impatiently, trying to tug his 
hand out of Josh’s grasp. 

Dad glanced helplessly at Mr. Dawes. I could see that he was 
embarrassed by how Josh was carrying on. I decided maybe I could help. 

“Let go, Josh,” I said quietly, grabbing Josh by the shoulder. “We 
promised we’d give Dark Falls a chance—remember?” 

“I already gave it a chance,” Josh whined, not letting go of Dad’s hand. 
“This house is old and ugly and I hate it.” 

“You haven’t even gone inside,” Dad said angrily. 

“Yes. Let’s go in,” Mr. Dawes urged, staring at Josh. 

“I’m staying outside,” Josh insisted. 

He can be really stubborn sometimes. I felt just as unhappy as Josh 
looking at this dark, old house. But I’d never carry on the way Josh was. 

“Josh, don’t you want to pick out your own room?” Mom asked. 

“No,” Josh muttered. 

He and I both glanced up to the second floor. There were two large bay 
windows side by side up there. They looked like two dark eyes staring back 
at us. 

“How long have you lived in your present house?” Mr. Dawes asked 

Dad. 

Dad had to think for a second. “About fourteen years,” he answered. 
“The kids have lived there for their whole lives.” 

“Moving is always hard,” Mr. Dawes said sympathetically, turning his 



gaze on me. “You know, Amanda, I moved here to Dark Falls just a few 
months ago. I didn’t like it much either, at first. But now I wouldn’t live 
anywhere else.” He winked at me. He had a cute dimple in his chin when he 
smiled. “Let’s go inside. It’s really quite nice. You’ll be surprised.” 

All of us followed Mr. Dawes, except Josh. “Are there other kids on 
this block?” Josh demanded. He made it sound more like a challenge than a 
question. 

Mr. Dawes nodded. “The school’s just two blocks away,” he said, 
pointing up the street. 

“See?” Mom quickly cut in. “A short walk to school. No more long 
bus rides every morning.” 

“I liked the bus,” Josh insisted. 

His mind was made up. He wasn’t going to give my parents a break, 
even though we’d both promised to be open-minded about this move. 

I don’t know what Josh thought he had to gain by being such a pain. I 
mean, Dad already had plenty to worry about. For one thing, he hadn’t been 
able to sell our old house yet. 

I didn’t like the idea of moving. But I knew that inheriting this big 
house was a great opportunity for us. We were so cramped in our little 
house. 

And once Dad managed to sell the old place, we wouldn’t have to 
worry at all about money anymore. 

Josh should at least give it a chance. That’s what I thought. 

Suddenly, from our car at the foot of the driveway, we heard Petey 
barking and howling and making a fuss. 

Petey is our dog, a white, curly-haired terrier, cute as a button, and 
usually well-behaved. He never minded being left in the car. But now he 
was yowling and yapping at full volume and scratching at the car window, 
desperate to get out. 

“Petey—quiet! Quiet!” I shouted. Petey usually listened to me. 

But not this time. 

“I’m going to let him out!” Josh declared, and took off down the 
driveway toward the car. 

“No. Wait—” Dad called. 

But I don’t think Josh could hear him over Petey’s wails. 

“Might as well let the dog explore,” Mr. Dawes said. “It’s going to be 



his house, too.” 

A few seconds later, Petey came charging across the lawn, kicking up 
brown leaves, yipping excitedly as he ran up to us. He jumped on all of us 
as if he hadn’t seen us in weeks and then, to our surprise, he started 
growling menacingly and barking at Mr. Dawes. 

“Petey—stop!” Mom yelled. 

“He’s never done this,” Dad said apologetically. “Really. He’s usually 
very friendly.” 

“He probably smells something on me. Another dog, maybe,” Mr. 
Dawes said, loosening his striped tie, looking warily at our growling dog. 

Finally, Josh grabbed Petey around the middle and lifted him away 
from Mr. Dawes. “Stop it, Petey,” Josh scolded, holding the dog up close to 
his face so that they were nose-to-nose. “Mr. Dawes is our friend.” 

Petey whimpered and licked Josh’s face. After a short while, Josh set 
him back down on the ground. Petey looked up at Mr. Dawes, then at me, 
then decided to go sniffing around the yard, letting his nose lead the way. 

“Let’s go inside,” Mr. Dawes urged, moving a hand through his short 
blond hair. He unlocked the front door and pushed it open. 

Mr. Dawes held the screen door open for us. I started to follow my 
parents into the house. 

“I’ll stay out here with Petey,” Josh insisted from the walk. 

Dad started to protest, but changed his mind. “Okay. Fine,” he said, 
sighing and shaking his head. “I’m not going to argue with you. Don’t come 
in. You can live outside if you want.” He sounded really exasperated. 

“I want to stay with Petey,” Josh said again, watching Petey nose his 
way through the dead flower bed. 

Mr. Dawes followed us into the hallway, gently closing the screen door 
behind him, giving Josh a final glance. “He’ll be fine,” he said softly, 
smiling at Mom. 

“He can be so stubborn sometimes,” Mom said apologetically. She 
peeked into the living room. “I’m really sorry about Petey. I don’t know 
what got into that dog.” 

“No problem. Let’s start in the living room,” Mr. Dawes said, leading 
the way. “I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how spacious it is. Of 
course, it needs work.” 

He took us on a tour of every room in the house. I was beginning to 



get excited. The house was really kind of neat. There were so many rooms 
and so many closets. And my room was huge and had its own bathroom and 
an old-fashioned window seat where I could sit at the window and look 
down at the street. 

I wished Josh had come inside with us. If he could see how great the 
house was inside, I knew he’d start to cheer up. 

I couldn’t believe how many rooms there were. Even a finished attic 
filled with old furniture and stacks of old, mysterious cartons we could 
explore. 

We must have been inside for at least half an hour. I didn’t really keep 
track of the time. I think all three of us were feeling cheered up. 

“Well, I think I’ve shown you everything,” Mr. Dawes said, glancing 
at his watch. He led the way to the front door. 

“Wait—I want to take one more look at my room,” I told them 
excitedly. I started up the stairs, taking them two at a time. “I’ll be down in 
a second.” 

“Hurry, dear. I’m sure Mr. Dawes has other appointments,” Mom 
called after me. 

I reached the second-floor landing and hurried down the narrow 
hallway and into my new room. “Wow!” I said aloud, and the word echoed 
faintly against the empty walls. 

It was so big. And I loved the bay window with the window seat. I 
walked over to it and peered out. Through the trees, I could see our car in 
the driveway and, beyond it, a house that looked a lot like ours across the 
street. 

I’m going to put my bed against that wall across from the window, I 
thought happily. And my desk can go over there. I’ll have room for a 
computer now! 

I took one more look at my closet, a long, walk-in closet with a light in 
the ceiling, and wide shelves against the back wall. 

I was heading to the door, thinking about which of my posters I 
wanted to bring with me, when I saw the boy. 

He stood in the doorway for just a second. And then he turned and 
disappeared down the hall. 

“Josh?” I cried. “Hey—come look!” 

With a shock, I realized it wasn’t Josh. 



For one thing, the boy had blond hair. 

“Hey!” I called and ran to the hallway, stopping just outside my 
bedroom door, looking both ways. “Who’s here?” 

But the long hall was empty. All of the doors were closed. 

“Whoa, Amanda,” I said aloud. 

Was I seeing things? 

Mom and Dad were calling from downstairs. I took one last look down 
the dark corridor, then hurried to rejoin them. 

“Hey, Mr. Dawes,” I called as I ran down the stairs, “is this house 
haunted?” 

He chuckled. The question seemed to strike him funny. “No. Sorry,” he 
said, looking at me with those crinkly blue eyes. “No ghost included. A lot 
of old houses around here are said to be haunted. But I’m afraid this isn’t 
one of them.” 

“I—I thought I saw something,” I said, feeling a little foolish. 

“Probably just shadows,” Mom said. “With all the trees, this house is 
so dark.” 

“Why don’t you run outside and tell Josh about the house,” Dad 
suggested, tucking in the front of his shirt. “Your Mom and I have some 
things to talk over with Mr. Dawes.” 

“Yes, master,” I said with a little bow, and obediently ran out to tell 
Josh all about what he had missed. “Hey, Josh,” I called, eagerly searching 
the yard. “Josh?” 

My heart sank. 

Josh and Petey were gone.

“Josh! Josh!” 

First I called Josh. Then I called Petey. But there was no sign of either 
of them. 

I ran down to the bottom of the driveway and peered into the car, but 
they weren’t there. Mom and Dad were still inside talking with Mr. Dawes. 
I looked along the street in both directions, but there was no sign of them. 

“Josh! Hey, Josh!” 

Finally, Mom and Dad came hurrying out the front door, looking 
alarmed. I guess they heard my shouts. “I can’t find Josh or Petey!” I yelled 
up to them from the street. 

“Maybe they’re around back,” Dad shouted down to me. 

I headed up the driveway, kicking away dead leaves as I ran. It was 
sunny down on the street, but as soon as I entered our yard, I was back in 
the shade, and it was immediately cool again. 

“Hey, Josh! Josh—where are you?” 

Why did I feel so scared? It was perfectly natural for Josh to wander 
off. He did it all the time. 

I ran full speed along the side of the house. Tall trees leaned over the 
house on this side, blocking out nearly all of the sunlight. 

The backyard was bigger than I’d expected, a long rectangle that 
sloped gradually down to a wooden fence at the back. Just like the front, 
this yard was a mass of tall weeds, poking up through a thick covering of 
brown leaves. A stone birdbath had toppled onto its side. Beyond it, I could 
see the side of the garage, a dark, brick building that matched the house. 

“Hey—Josh!” 

He wasn’t back here. I stopped and searched the ground for footprints 
or a sign that he had run through the thick leaves. 

“Well?” Out of breath, Dad came jogging up to me. 

“No sign of him,” I said, surprised at how worried I felt. 

“Did you check the car?” He sounded more angry than worried. 

“Yes. It’s the first place I looked.” I gave the backyard a last quick 
search. “I don’t believe Josh would just take off.” 



“I do,” Dad said, rolling his eyes. “You know your brother when he 
doesn’t get his way. Maybe he wants us to think he’s run away from home.” 
He frowned. 

“Where is he?” Mom asked as we returned to the front of the house. 

Dad and I both shrugged. “Maybe he made a friend and wandered off,” 
Dad said. He raised a hand and scratched his curly brown hair. I could tell 
that he was starting to worry, too. 

“We’ve got to find him,” Mom said, gazing down to the street. “He 
doesn’t know this neighborhood at all. He probably wandered off and got 
lost.” 

Mr. Dawes locked the front door and stepped down off the porch, 
pocketing the keys. “He couldn’t have gotten far,” he said, giving Mom a 
reassuring smile. “Let’s drive around the block. I’m sure we’ll find him.” 

Mom shook her head and glanced nervously at Dad. “I’ll kill him,” she 
muttered. Dad patted her on the shoulder. 

Mr. Dawes opened the trunk of the small Honda, pulled off his dark 
blazer, and tossed it inside. Then he took out a wide-brimmed, black 
cowboy hat and put it on his head. 

“Hey—that’s quite a hat,” Dad said, climbing into the front passenger 

seat. 

“Keeps the sun away,” Mr. Dawes said, sliding behind the wheel and 
slamming the car door. 

Mom and I got in back. Glancing over at her, I saw that Mom was as 
worried as I was. 

We headed down the block in silence, all four of us staring out the car 
windows. The houses we passed all seemed old. Most of them were even 
bigger than our house. All of them seemed to be in better condition, nicely 
painted with neat, well-trimmed lawns. 

I didn’t see any people in the houses or yards, and there was no one on 
the street. 

It certainly is a quiet neighborhood, I thought. And shady. The houses 
all seemed to be surrounded by tall, leafy trees. The front yards we drove 
slowly past all seemed to be bathed in shade. The street was the only sunny 
place, a narrow gold ribbon that ran through the shadows on both sides. 

Maybe that’s why it’s called Dark Falls, I thought. 

“Where is that son of mine?” Dad asked, staring hard out the 



windshield. 

“I’ll kill him. I really will,” Mom muttered. It wasn’t the first time she 
had said that about Josh. 

We had gone around the block twice. No sign of him. 

Mr. Dawes suggested we drive around the next few blocks, and Dad 
quickly agreed. “Hope I don’t get lost. I’m new here, too,” Mr. Dawes said, 
turning a corner. “Hey, there’s the school,” he announced, pointing out the 
window at a tall redbrick building. It looked very old-fashioned, with white 
columns on both sides of the double front doors. “Of course, it’s closed 
now,” Mr. Dawes added. 

My eyes searched the fenced-in playground behind the school. It was 
empty. No one there. 

“Could Josh have walked this far?” Mom asked, her voice tight and 
higher than usual. 

“Josh doesn’t walk,” Dad said, rolling his eyes. “He runs.” 

“We’ll find him,” Mr. Dawes said confidently, tapping his fingers on 
the wheel as he steered. 

We turned a corner onto another shady block. A street sign read 
“Cemetery Drive”, and sure enough, a large cemetery rose up in front of us. 
Granite gravestones rolled along a low hill, which sloped down and then up 
again onto a large flat stretch, also marked with rows of low grave markers 
and monuments. 

A few shrubs dotted the cemetery, but there weren’t many trees. As we 
drove slowly past, the gravestones passing by in a blur on the left, I realized 
that this was the sunniest spot I had seen in the whole town. 

“There’s your son.” Mr. Dawes, pointing out the window, stopped the 
car suddenly. 

“Oh, thank goodness!” Mom exclaimed, leaning down to see out the 
window on my side of the car. 

Sure enough, there was Josh, running wildly along a crooked row of 
low, white gravestones. “What’s he doing here?” I asked, pushing open my 
car door. 

I stepped down from the car, took a few steps onto the grass, and 
called to him. At first, he didn’t react to my shouts. He seemed to be 
ducking and dodging through the tombstones. He would run in one 
direction, then cut to the side, then head in another direction. 



Why was he doing that? 

I took another few steps—and then stopped, gripped with fear. 

I suddenly realized why Josh was darting and ducking like that, 
running so wildly through the tombstones. He was being chased. 

Someone—or something—was after him. 



3 


Then, as I took a few reluctant steps toward Josh, watching him bend low, 
then change directions, his arms outstretched as he ran, I realized I had it 
completely backward. 

Josh wasn’t being chased. Josh was chasing. 

He was chasing after Petey. 

Okay, okay. So sometimes my imagination runs away with me. 
Running through an old graveyard like this—even in bright daylight—it’s 
only natural that a person might start to have weird thoughts. 

I called to Josh again, and this time he heard me and turned around. He 
looked worried. “Amanda—come help me! ” he cried. 

“Josh, what’s the matter?” I ran as fast as I could to catch up with him, 
but he kept darting through the gravestones, moving from row to row. 

“Help!” 

“Josh—what’s wrong?” I turned and saw that Mom and Dad were 
right behind me. 

“It’s Petey,” Josh explained, out of breath. “I can’t get him to stop. I 
caught him once, but he pulled away from me.” 

“Petey! Petey!” Dad started calling the dog. But Petey was moving 
from stone to stone, sniffing each one, then running to the next. 

“How did you get all the way over here?” Dad asked as he caught up 
with my brother. 

“I had to follow Petey,” Josh explained, still looking very worried. “He 
just took off. One second he was sniffing around that dead flower bed in our 
front yard. The next second, he just started to run. He wouldn’t stop when I 
called. Wouldn’t even look back. He kept running till he got here. I had to 
follow. I was afraid he’d get lost.” 

Josh stopped and gratefully let Dad take over the chase. “I don’t know 
what that dumb dog’s problem is,” he said to me. “He’s just weird.” 

It took Dad a few tries, but he finally managed to grab Petey and pick 
him up off the ground. Our little terrier gave a halfhearted yelp of protest, 
then allowed himself to be carried away. 

We all trooped back to the car on the side of the road. Mr. Dawes was 



waiting by the car. “Maybe you’d better get a leash for that dog,” he said, 
looking very concerned. 

“Petey’s never been on a leash,” Josh protested, wearily climbing into 
the backseat. 

“Well, we might have to try one for a while,” Dad said quietly. 
“Especially if he keeps running away.” Dad tossed Petey into the backseat. 
The dog eagerly curled up in Josh’s arms. 

The rest of us piled into the car, and Mr. Dawes drove us back to his 
office, a tiny, white, flat-roofed building at the end of a row of small offices. 
As we rode, I reached over and stroked the back of Petey’s head. 

Why did the dog run away like that? I wondered. Petey had never done 
that before. 

I guessed that Petey was also upset about our moving. After all, Petey 
had spent his whole life in our old house. He probably felt a lot like Josh 
and I did about having to pack up and move and never see the old 
neighborhood again. 

The new house, the new streets, and all the new smells must have 
freaked the poor dog out. Josh wanted to run away from the whole idea. 
And so did Petey. 

Anyway, that was my theory. 

Mr. Dawes parked the car in front of his tiny office, shook Dad’s hand, 
and gave him a business card. “You can come by next week,” he told Mom 
and Dad. “I’ll have all the legal work done by then. After you sign the 
papers, you can move in anytime.” 

He pushed open the car door and, giving us all a final smile, prepared 
to climb out. 

“Compton Dawes,” Mom said, reading the white business card over 
Dad’s shoulder. “That’s an unusual name. Is Compton an old family name?” 

Mr. Dawes shook his head. “No,” he said, “I’m the only Compton in 
my family. I have no idea where the name comes from. No idea at all. 
Maybe my parents didn’t know how to spell Charlie!” 

Chuckling at his terrible joke, he climbed out of the car, lowered the 
wide black Stetson hat on his head, pulled his blazer from the tmnk, and 
disappeared into the small white building. 

Dad climbed behind the wheel, moving the seat back to make room for 
his big stomach. Mom got up front, and we started the long drive home. “I 



guess you and Petey had quite an adventure today,” Mom said to Josh, 
rolling up her window because Dad had turned on the air conditioner. 

“I guess,” Josh said without enthusiasm. Petey was sound asleep in his 
lap, snoring quietly. 

“You’re going to love your room,” I told Josh. “The whole house is 
great. Really.” 

Josh stared at me thoughtfully, but didn’t answer. 

I poked him in the ribs with my elbow. “Say something. Did you hear 
what I said?” 

But the weird, thoughtful look didn’t fade from Josh’s face. 

The next couple of weeks seemed to crawl by. I walked around the house 
thinking about how I’d never see my room again, how I’d never eat 
breakfast in this kitchen again, how I’d never watch TV in the living room 
again. Morbid stuff like that. 

I had this sick feeling when the movers came one afternoon and 
delivered a tall stack of cartons. Time to pack up. It was really happening. 
Even though it was the middle of the afternoon, I went up to my room and 
flopped down on my bed. I didn’t nap or anything. I just stared at the 
ceiling for more than an hour, and all these wild, unconnected thoughts ran 
through my head, like a dream, only I was awake. 

I wasn’t the only one who was nervous about the move. Mom and Dad 
were snapping at each other over nothing at all. One morning they had a big 
fight over whether the bacon was too crispy or not. 

In a way, it was funny to see them being so childish. Josh was acting 
really sullen all the time. He hardly spoke a word to anyone. And Petey 
sulked, too. That dumb dog wouldn’t even pick himself up and come over 
to me when I had some table scraps for him. 

I guess the hardest part about moving was saying good-bye to my 
friends. Carol and Amy were away at camp, so I had to write to them. But 
Kathy was home, and she was my oldest and best friend, and the hardest to 
say good-bye to. 

I think some people were surprised that Kathy and I had stayed such 
good friends. For one thing, we look so different. I’m tall and thin and dark, 
and she’s fair-skinned, with long blonde hair, and a little chubby. But we’ve 
been friends since preschool, and best friends since fourth grade. 



When she came over the night before the move, we were both terribly 
awkward. “Kathy, you shouldn’t be nervous,” I told her. “You’re not the 
one who’s moving away forever.” 

“It’s not like you’re moving to China or something,” she answered, 
chewing hard on her bubble gum. “Dark Falls is only four hours away, 
Amanda. We’ll see each other a lot.” 

“Yeah, I guess,” I said. But I didn’t believe it. Four hours away was as 
bad as being in China, as far as I was concerned. “I guess we can still talk 
on the phone,” I said glumly. 

She blew a small green bubble, then sucked it back into her mouth. 
“Yeah. Sure,” she said, pretending to be enthusiastic. “You’re lucky, you 
know. Moving out of this crummy neighborhood to a big house.” 

“It’s not a crummy neighborhood,” I insisted. I don’t know why I was 
defending the neighborhood. I never had before. One of our favorite 
pastimes was thinking of places we’d rather be growing up. 

“School won’t be the same without you,” she sighed, curling her legs 
under her on the chair. “Who’s going to slip me the answers in math?” 

I laughed. “I always slipped you the wrong answers.” 

“But it was the thought that counted,” Kathy said. And then she 
groaned. “Ugh. Junior high. Is your new junior high part of the high school 
or part of the elementary school?” 

I made a disgusted face. “Everything’s in one building. It’s a small 
town, remember? There’s no separate high school. At least, I didn’t see 
one.” 

“Bummer,” she said. 

Bummer was right. 

We chatted for hours. Until Kathy’s mom called and said it was time 
for her to come home. 

Then we hugged. I had made up my mind that I wouldn’t cry, but I 
could feel the big, hot tears forming in the corners of my eyes. And then 
they were running down my cheeks. 

“I’m so miserable!” I wailed. 

I had planned to be really controlled and mature. But Kathy was my 
best friend, after all, and what could I do? 

We made a promise that we’d always be together on our birthdays—no 
matter what. We’d force our parents to make sure we didn’t miss each 



other’s birthdays. 

And then we hugged—again. And Kathy said, “Don’t worry. We’ll see 
each other a lot. Really.” And she had tears in her eyes, too. 

She turned and ran out the door. The screen door slammed hard behind 
her. I stood there staring out into the darkness until Petey came scampering 
in, his toenails clicking across the linoleum, and started to lick my hand. 

The next morning, moving day, was a rainy Saturday. Not a downpour. No 
thunder or lightning. But just enough rain and wind to make the long drive 
slow and unpleasant. 

The sky seemed to get darker as we neared the new neighborhood. The 
heavy trees bent low over the street. “Slow down, Jack,” Mom warned 
shrilly. “The street is really slick.” 

But Dad was in a hurry to get to the house before the moving van did. 
“They’ll just put the stuff anywhere if we’re not there to supervise,” he 
explained. 

Josh, beside me in the backseat, was being a real pain, as usual. He 
kept complaining that he was thirsty. When that didn’t get results, he started 
whining that he was starving. But we had all had a big breakfast, so that 
didn’t get any reaction, either. 

He just wanted attention, of course. I kept trying to cheer him up by 
telling him how great the house was inside and how big his room was. He 
still hadn’t seen it. 

But he didn’t want to be cheered up. He started wrestling with Petey, 
getting the poor dog all worked up, until Dad had to shout at him to stop. 

“Let’s all try really hard not to get on each other’s nerves,” Mom 
suggested. 

Dad laughed. “Good idea, dear.” 

“Don’t make fun of me,” she snapped. 

They started to argue about who was more exhausted from all the 
packing. Petey stood up on his hind legs and started to howl at the back 
window. 

“Can’t you shut him up?” Mom screamed. 

I pulled Petey down, but he struggled back up and started howling 
again. “He’s never done this before,” I said. 

“Just get him quiet!” Mom insisted. 



I pulled Petey down by his hind legs, and Josh started to howl. Mom 
turned around and gave him a dirty look. Josh didn’t stop howling, though. 
He thought he was a riot. 

Finally, Dad pulled the car up the driveway of the new house. The tires 
crunched over the wet gravel. Rain pounded on the roof. 

“Home sweet home,” Mom said. I couldn’t tell if she was being 
sarcastic or not. I think she was really glad the long car ride was over. 

“At least we beat the movers,” Dad said, glancing at his watch. Then 
his expression changed. “Hope they’re not lost.” 

“It’s as dark as night out there,” Josh complained. 

Petey was jumping up and down in my lap, desperate to get out of the 
car. He was usually a good traveler. But once the car stopped, he wanted out 
immediately. 

I opened my car door and he leaped onto the driveway with a splash 
and started to run in a wild zigzag across the front yard. 

“At least someone’s glad to be here,” Josh said quietly. 

Dad ran up to the porch and, fumbling with the unfamiliar keys, 
managed to get the front door open. Then he motioned for us to come into 
the house. 

Mom and Josh ran across the walk, eager to get in out of the rain. I 
closed the car door behind me and started to jog after them. 

But something caught my eye. I stopped and looked up to the twin bay 
windows above the porch. 

I held a hand over my eyebrows to shield my eyes and squinted 
through the rain. 

Yes. I saw it. 

A face. In the window on the left. 

The boy. 

The same boy was up there, staring down at me.

“Wipe your feet! Don’t track mud on the nice clean floors!” Mom called. 
Her voice echoed against the bare walls of the empty living room. 

I stepped into the hallway. The house smelled of paint. The painters 
had just finished on Thursday. It was hot in the house, much hotter than 
outside. 

“This kitchen light won’t go on,” Dad called from the back. “Did the 
painters turn off the electricity or something?” 

“How should I know?” Mom shouted back. 

Their voices sounded so loud in the big, empty house. 

“Mom—there’s someone upstairs!” I cried, wiping my feet on the new 
welcome mat and hurrying into the living room. 

She was at the window, staring out at the rain, looking for the movers 
probably. She spun around as I came in. “What?” 

“There’s a boy upstairs. I saw him in the window,” I said, struggling to 
catch my breath. 

Josh entered the room from the back hallway. He’d probably been with 
Dad. He laughed. “Is someone already living here?” 

“There’s no one upstairs,” Mom said, rolling her eyes. “Are you two 
going to give me a break today, or what?” 

“What did I do?” Josh whined. 

“Listen, Amanda, we’re all a little on edge today—” Mom started. 

But I interrupted her. “I saw his face, Mom. In the window. I’m not 
crazy, you know.” 

“Says who?” Josh cracked. 

“Amanda!” Mom bit her lower lip, the way she always did when she 
was really exasperated. “You saw a reflection of something. Of a tree 
probably.” She turned back to the window. The rain was coming down in 
sheets now, the wind driving it noisily against the large picture window. 

I ran to the stairway, cupped my hands over my mouth, and shouted up 
to the second floor, “Who’s up there?” 

No answer. 

“Who’s up there?” I called, a little louder. 



Mom had her hands over her ears. “Amanda—please!” 

Josh had disappeared through the dining room. He was finally 
exploring the house. 

“There’s someone up there,” I insisted and, impulsively, I started up 
the wooden stairway, my sneakers thudding loudly on the bare steps. 

“Amanda—” I heard Mom call after me. 

But I was too angry to stop. Why didn’t she believe me? Why did she 
have to say it was a reflection of a tree I saw up there? 

I was curious. I had to know who was upstairs. I had to prove Mom 
wrong. I had to show her I hadn’t seen a stupid reflection. I guess I can be 
pretty stubborn, too. Maybe it’s a family trait. 

The stairs squeaked and creaked under me as I climbed. I didn’t feel at 
all scared until I reached the second-floor landing. Then I suddenly had this 
heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

I stopped, breathing hard, leaning on the banister. 

Who could it be? A burglar? A bored neighborhood kid who had 
broken into an empty house for a thrill? 

Maybe I shouldn’t be up here alone, I realized. 

Maybe the boy in the window was dangerous. 

“Anybody up here?” I called, my voice suddenly trembly and weak. 

Still leaning against the banister, I listened. 

And I could hear footsteps scampering across the hallway. 

No. 

Not footsteps. 

The rain. That’s what it was. The patter of rain against the slate- 
shingled roof. 

For some reason, the sound made me feel a little calmer. I let go of the 
banister and stepped into the long, narrow hallway. It was dark up here, 
except for a rectangle of gray light from a small window at the other end. 

I took a few steps, the old wooden floorboards creaking noisily 
beneath me. “Anybody up here?” 

Again no answer. 

I stepped up to the first doorway on my left. The door was closed. The 
smell of fresh paint was suffocating. There was a light switch on the wall 
near the door. Maybe it’s for the hall light, I thought. I clicked it on. But 
nothing happened. 



“Anybody here?” 

My hand was trembling as I grabbed the doorknob. It felt warm in my 
hand. And damp. 

I turned it and, taking a deep breath, pushed open the door. 

I peered into the room. Gray light filtered in through the bay window. 
A flash of lightning made me jump back. The thunder that followed was a 
dull, distant roar. 

Slowly, carefully, I took a step into the room. Then another. 

No sign of anyone. 

This was a guest bedroom. Or it could be Josh’s room if he decided he 
liked it. 

Another flash of lightning. The sky seemed to be darkening. It was 
pitch-black out there even though it was just after lunchtime. 

I backed into the hall. The next room down was going to be mine. It 
also had a bay window that looked down on the front yard. 

Was the boy I saw staring down at me in my room? 

I crept down the hall, letting my hand run along the wall for some 
reason, and stopped outside my door, which was also closed. 

Taking a deep breath, I knocked on the door. “Who’s in there?” I 
called. 

I listened. 

Silence. 

Then a clap of thunder, closer than the last. I froze as if I were 
paralyzed, holding my breath. It was so hot up here, hot and damp. And the 
smell of paint was making me dizzy. 

I grabbed the doorknob. “Anybody in there?” 

I started to turn the knob—when the boy crept up from behind and 
grabbed my shoulder.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t cry out. 

My heart seemed to stop. My chest felt as if it were about to explode. 

With a desperate, terrified effort, I spun around. 

“Josh!” I shrieked. “You scared me to death! I thought—” 

He let go of me and took a step back. “Gotcha!” he declared, and then 
started to laugh, a high-pitched laugh that echoed down the long, bare 
hallway. 

My heart was pounding hard now. My forehead throbbed. “You’re not 
funny,” I said angrily. I shoved him against the wall. “You really scared 
me.” 

He laughed and rolled around on the floor. He’s really a sicko. I tried 
to shove him again but missed. 

Angrily, I turned away from him—just in time to see my bedroom 
door slowly swinging open. 

I gasped in disbelief. And froze, gaping at the moving door. 

Josh stopped laughing and stood up, immediately serious, his dark 
eyes wide with fright. 

I could hear someone moving inside the room. 

I could hear whispering. 

Excited giggles. 

“Who—who’s there?” I managed to stammer in a high little voice I 
didn’t recognize. 

The door, creaking loudly, opened a bit more, then started to close. 

“Who’s there?” I demanded, a bit more forcefully. 

Again, I could hear whispering, someone moving about. 

Josh had backed up against the wall and was edging away, toward the 
stairs. He had an expression on his face I’d never seen before—sheer terror. 

The door, creaking like a door in a movie haunted house, closed a little 
more. 

Josh was nearly to the stairway. He was staring at me, violently 
motioning with his hand for me to follow. 



But instead, I stepped forward, grabbed the doorknob, and pushed the 
door open hard. 

It didn’t resist. 

I let go of the doorknob and stood blocking the doorway. “Who’s 
there?” 

The room was empty. 

Thunder crashed. 

It took me a few seconds to realize what was making the door move. 
The window on the opposite wall had been left open several inches. The 
gusting wind through the open window must have been opening and closing 
the door. I guessed that also explained the other sounds I heard inside the 
room, the sounds I thought were whispers. 

Who had left the window open? The painters, probably. 

I took a deep breath and let it out slowly, waiting for my pounding 
heart to settle down to normal. 

Feeling a little foolish, I walked quickly to the window and pushed it 

shut. 

“Amanda—are you all right?” Josh whispered from the hallway. 

I started to answer him. But then I had a better idea. 

He had practically scared me to death a few minutes before. Why not 
give him a little scare? He deserved it. 

So I didn’t answer him. 

I could hear him take a few timid steps closer to my room. “Amanda? 
Amanda? You okay?” 

I tiptoed over to my closet, pulled the door open a third of the way. 
Then I laid down flat on the floor, on my back, with my head and shoulders 
hidden inside the closet and the rest of me out in the room. 

“Amanda?” Josh sounded very scared. 

“Ohhhhh,” I moaned loudly. 

I knew when he saw me sprawled on the floor like this, he’d totally 
freak out! 

“Amanda—what’s happening?” 

He was in the doorway now. He’d see me any second now, lying in the 
dark room, my head hidden from view, the lightning flashing impressively 
and the thunder cracking outside the old window. 

I took a deep breath and held it to keep from giggling. 



“Amanda?” he whispered. And then he must have seen me, because he 
uttered a loud “Huh?!” And I heard him gasp. 

And then he screamed at the top of his lungs. I heard him running 
down the hall to the stairway, shrieking, “Mom! Dad!” And I heard his 
sneakers thudding down the wooden stairs, with him screaming and calling 
all the way down. 

I snickered to myself. Then, before I could pull myself up, I felt a 
rough, warm tongue licking my face. 

“Petey!” 

He was licking my cheeks, licking my eyelids, licking me frantically, 
as if he were trying to revive me, or as if to let me know that everything 
was okay. 

“Oh, Petey! Petey!” I cried, laughing and throwing my arms around 
the sweet dog. “Stop! You’re getting me all sticky!” 

But he wouldn’t stop. He kept on licking fiercely. 

The poor dog is nervous, too, I thought. 

“Come on, Petey, shape up,” I told him, holding his panting face away 
with both my hands. “There’s nothing to be nervous about. This new place 
is going to be fun. You’ll see.”

That night, I was smiling to myself as I fluffed up my pillow and slid into 
bed. I was thinking about how terrified Josh had been that afternoon, how 
frightened he looked even after I came prancing down the stairs, perfectly 
okay. How angry he was that I’d fooled him. 

Of course, Mom and Dad didn’t think it was funny. They were both 
nervous and upset because the moving van had just arrived, an hour late. 
They forced Josh and me to call a truce. No more scaring each other. 

“It’s hard not to get scared in this creepy old place,” Josh muttered. 
But we reluctantly agreed not to play any more jokes on each other, if we 
could possibly help it. 

The men, complaining about the rain, started carrying in all of our 
furniture. Josh and I helped show them where we wanted stuff in our rooms. 
They dropped my dresser on the stairs, but it only got a small scratch. 

The furniture looked strange and small in this big house. Josh and I 
tried to stay out of the way while Mom and Dad worked all day, arranging 
things, emptying cartons, putting clothes away. Mom even managed to get 
the curtains hung in my room. 

What a day! 

Now, a little after ten o’clock, trying to get to sleep for the first time in 
my new room, I turned onto my side, then onto my back. Even though this 
was my old bed, I couldn’t get comfortable. 

Everything seemed so different, so wrong. The bed didn’t face the 
same direction as in my old bedroom. The walls were bare. I hadn’t had 
time to hang any of my posters. The room seemed so large and empty. The 
shadows seemed so much darker. 

My back started to itch, and then I suddenly felt itchy all over. The bed 
is filled with bugs! I thought, sitting up. But of course that was ridiculous. It 
was my same old bed with clean sheets. 

I forced myself to settle back down and closed my eyes. Sometimes 
when I can’t get to sleep, I count silently by twos, picturing each number in 
my mind as I think it. It usually helps to clear my mind so that I can drift off 
to sleep. 



I tried it now, burying my face in the pillow, picturing the numbers 
rolling past... 4 ... 6 ... 8 ... 

I yawned loudly, still wide awake at two-twenty. 

I’m going to be awake forever, I thought. I’m never going to be able to 
sleep in this new room. 

But then I must have drifted off without realizing it. I don’t know how 
long I slept. An hour or two at the most. It was a light, uncomfortable sleep. 
Then something woke me. I sat straight up, startled. 

Despite the heat of the room, I felt cold all over. Looking down to the 
end of the bed, I saw that I had kicked off the sheet and light blanket. With 
a groan, I reached down for them, but then froze. 

I heard whispers. 

Someone was whispering across the room. 

“Who—who’s there?” My voice was a whisper, too, tiny and 
frightened. 

I grabbed my covers and pulled them up to my chin. 

I heard more whispers. The room came into focus as my eyes adjusted 
to the dim light. 

The curtains. The long, sheer curtains from my old room that my 
mother had hung that afternoon were fluttering at the window. 

So. That explained the whispers. The billowing curtains must have 
woken me up. 

A soft, gray light floated in from outside. The curtains cast moving 
shadows onto the foot of my bed. 

Yawning, I stretched and climbed out of bed. I felt chilled all over as I 
crept across the wooden floor to close the window. 

As I came near, the curtains stopped billowing and floated back into 
place. I pushed them aside and reached out to close the window. 

“Oh!” 

I uttered a soft cry when I realized that the window was closed. 

But how could the curtains flutter like that with the window closed? I 
stood there for a while, staring out at the grays of the night. There wasn’t 
much of a draft. The window seemed pretty airtight. 

Had I imagined the curtains billowing? Were my eyes playing tricks on 

me? 

Yawning, I hurried back through the strange shadows to my bed and 



pulled the covers up as high as they would go. “Amanda, stop scaring 
yourself,” I scolded. 

When I fell back to sleep a few minutes later, I had the ugliest, most 
terrifying dream. 

I dreamed that we were all dead. Mom, Dad, Josh, and me. 

At first, I saw us sitting around the dinner table in the new dining 
room. The room was very bright, so bright I couldn’t see our faces very 
well. They were just a bright, white blur. 

But, then, slowly, slowly, everything came into focus, and I could see 
that beneath our hair, we had no faces. Our skin was gone, and only our 
gray-green skulls were left. Bits of flesh clung to my bony cheeks. There 
were only deep, black sockets where my eyes had been. 

The four of us, all dead, sat eating in silence. Our dinner plates, I saw, 
were filled with small bones. A big platter in the center of the table was 
piled high with gray-green bones, human-looking bones. 

And then, in this dream, our disgusting meal was interrupted by a loud 
knocking on the door, an insistent pounding that grew louder and louder. It 
was Kathy, my friend from back home. I could see her at our front door, 
pounding on it with both fists. 

I wanted to go answer the door. I wanted to run from the dining room 
and pull open the door and greet Kathy. I wanted to talk to Kathy. I wanted 
to tell her what had happened to me, to explain that I was dead and that my 
face had fallen away. 

I wanted to see Kathy so badly. 

But I couldn’t get up from the table. I tried and tried, but I couldn’t get 
up. 

The pounding on the door grew louder and louder, until it was 
deafening. But I just sat there with my gruesome family, picking up bones 
from my dinner plate and eating them. 

I woke up with a start, the horror of the dream still with me. I could 
still hear the pounding in my ears. I shook my head, trying to chase the 
dream away. 

It was morning. I could tell from the blue of the sky outside the 
window. 

“Oh, no.” 

The curtains. They were billowing again, flapping noisily as they blew 



into the room. 

I sat up and stared. 

The window was still closed.

“I’ll take a look at the window. There must be a draft or a leak or 
something,” Dad said at breakfast. He shoveled in another mouthful of 
scrambled eggs and ham. 

“But, Dad—it’s so weird!” I insisted, still feeling scared. “The curtains 
were blowing like crazy, and the window was closed !” 

“There might be a pane missing,” Dad suggested. 

“Amanda is a pain!” Josh cracked. His idea of a really witty joke. 

“Don’t start with your sister,” Mom said, putting her plate down on the 
table and dropping into her chair. She looked tired. Her black hair, usually 
carefully pulled back, was disheveled. She tugged at the belt on her 
bathrobe. “Whew. I don’t think I slept two hours last night.” 

“Neither did I,” I said, sighing. “I kept thinking that boy would show 
up in my room again.” 

“Amanda—you’ve really got to stop this,” Mom said sharply. “Boys in 
your room. Curtains blowing. You have to realize that you’re nervous, and 
your imagination is working overtime.” 

“But, Mom—” I started. 

“Maybe a ghost was behind the curtains,” Josh said, teasing. He raised 
up his hands and made a ghostly “oooooooh” wail. 

“Whoa.” Mom put a hand on Josh’s shoulder. “Remember what you 
promised about scaring each other?” 

“It’s going to be hard for all of us to adjust to this place,” Dad said. 
“You may have dreamed about the curtains blowing, Amanda. You said you 
had bad dreams, right?” 

The terrifying nightmare flashed back into my mind. Once again I saw 
the big platter of bones on the table. I shivered. 

“It’s so damp in here,” Mom said. 

“A little sunshine will help dry the place out,” Dad said. 

I peered out the window. The sky had turned solid gray. Trees seemed 
to spread darkness over our backyard. “Where’s Petey?” I asked. 

“Out back,” Mom replied, swallowing a mouthful of eggs. “He got up 
early, too. Couldn’t sleep, I guess. So I let him out.” 



“What are we doing today?” Josh asked. He always needed to know 
the plan for the day. Every detail. Mainly so he could argue about it. 

“Your father and I still have a lot of unpacking to do,” Mom said, 
glancing to the back hallway, which was cluttered with unopened cartons. 
“You two can explore the neighborhood. See what you can find out. See if 
there are any other kids your age around.” 

“In other words, you want us to get lost!” I said. 

Mom and Dad both laughed. “You’re very smart, Amanda.” 

“But I want to help unpack my stuff,” Josh whined. I knew he’d argue 
with the plan, just like always. 

“Go get dressed and take a long walk,” Dad said. “Take Petey with 
you, okay? And take a leash for him. I left one by the front stairs.” 

“What about our bikes? Why can’t we ride our bikes?” Josh asked. 

“They’re buried in the back of the garage,” Dad told him. “You’ll 
never be able to get to them. Besides, you have a flat tire.” 

“If I can’t ride my bike, I’m not going out,” Josh insisted, crossing his 
arms in front of his chest. 

Mom and Dad had to argue with him. Then threaten him. Finally, he 
agreed to go for “a short walk.” 

I finished my breakfast, thinking about Kathy and my other friends 
back home. I wondered what the kids were like in Dark Falls. I wondered if 
I’d be able to find new friends, real friends. 

I volunteered to do the breakfast dishes since Mom and Dad had so 
much work to do. The warm water felt soothing on my hands as I sponged 
the dishes clean. I guess maybe I’m weird. I like washing dishes. 

Behind me, from somewhere in the front of the house, I could hear 
Josh arguing with Dad. I could just barely make out the words over the 
trickle of the tap water. 

“Your basketball is packed in one of these cartons,” Dad was saying. 
Then Josh said something. Then Dad said, “How should I know which 
one?” Then Josh said something. Then Dad said, “No, I don’t have time to 
look now. Believe it or not, your basketball isn’t at the top of my list.” 

I stacked the last dish onto the counter to drain, and looked for a dish 
towel to dry my hands. There was none in sight. I guess they hadn’t been 
unpacked yet. 

Wiping off my hands on the front of my robe, I headed for the stairs. 



“I’ll be dressed in five minutes,” I called to Josh, who was still arguing with 
Dad in the living room. “Then we can go out.” 

I started up the front stairs, and then stopped. 

Above me on the landing stood a strange girl, about my age, with short 
black hair. She was smiling down at me, not a warm smile, not a friendly 
smile, but the coldest, most frightening smile I had ever seen. 



8 


A hand touched my shoulder. 

I spun around. 

It was Josh. “I’m not going for a walk unless I can take my 
basketball,” he said. 

“Josh—please!” I looked back up to the landing, and the girl was gone. 

I felt cold all over. My legs were all trembly. I grabbed the banister. 

“Dad! Come here—please!” I called. 

Josh’s face filled with alarm. “Hey, I didn’t do anything!” he shouted. 

“No—it’s—it’s not you,” I said, and called Dad again. 

“Amanda, I’m kind of busy,” Dad said, appearing below at the foot of 
the stairs, already perspiring from uncrating living room stuff. 

“Dad, I saw somebody,” I told him. “Up there. A girl.” I pointed. 

“Amanda, please,” he replied, making a face. “Stop seeing things— 
okay? There’s no one in this house except the four of us.... and maybe a 
few mice.” 

“Mice?” Josh asked with sudden interest. “Really? Where?” 

“Dad, I didn’t imagine it,” I said, my voice cracking. I was really hurt 
that he didn’t believe me. 

“Amanda, look up there,” Dad said, gazing up to the landing. “What 
do you see?” 

I followed his gaze. There was a pile of my clothes on the landing. 
Mom must have just unpacked them. 

“It’s just clothes,” Dad said impatiently. “It’s not a girl. It’s clothes.” 
He rolled his eyes. 

“Sorry,” I said quietly. I repeated it as I started up the stairs. “Sorry.” 

But I didn’t really feel sorry. I felt confused. 

And still scared. 

Was it possible that I thought a pile of clothes was a smiling girl? 

No. I didn’t think so. 

I’m not crazy. And I have really good eyesight. 

So then, what was going on? 



I opened the door to my room, turned on the ceiling light, and saw the 
curtains billowing in front of the bay window. 

Oh, no. Not again, I thought. 

I hurried over to them. This time, the window was open. 

Who opened it? 

Mom, I guessed. 

Warm, wet air blew into the room. The sky was heavy and gray. It 
smelled like rain. 

Turning to my bed, I had another shock. 

Someone had laid out an outfit for me. A pair of faded jeans and a pale 
blue, sleeveless T-shirt. They were spread out side by side at the foot of the 
bed. 

Who had put them there? Mom? 

I stood at the doorway and called to her. “Mom? Mom? Did you pick 
out clothes for me?” 

I could hear her shout something from downstairs, but I couldn’t make 
out the words. 

Calm down, Amanda, I told myself. Calm down. 

Of course Mom pulled the clothes out. Of course Mom put them there. 

From the doorway, I heard whispering in my closet. 

Whispering and hushed giggling behind the closet door. 

This was the last straw. “What’s going on here?” I yelled at the top of 
my lungs. 

I stormed over to the closet and pulled open the door. 

Frantically, I pushed clothes out of the way. No one in there. 

Mice? I thought. Had I heard the mice that Dad was talking about? 

“I’ve got to get out of here,” I said aloud. 

The room, I realized, was driving me crazy. 

No. I was driving myself crazy. Imagining all of these weird things. 

There was a logical explanation for everything. Everything. 

As I pulled up my jeans and fastened them, I said the word “logical” 
over and over in my mind. I said it so many times that it didn’t sound like a 
real word anymore. 

Calm down, Amanda. Calm down. 

I took a deep breath and held it to ten. 

“Boo!” 



“Josh—cut it out. You didn’t scare me,” I told him, sounding more 
cross than I had meant to. 

“Let’s get out of here,” he said, staring at me from the doorway. “This 
place gives me the creeps.” 

“Huh? You, too?” I exclaimed. “What’s your problem?” 

He started to say something, then stopped. He suddenly looked 
embarrassed. “Forget it,” he muttered. 

“No, tell me,” I insisted. “What were you going to say?” 

He kicked at the floor molding. “I had a really creepy dream last 
night,” he finally admitted, looking past me to the fluttering curtains at the 
window. 

“A dream?” I remembered my horrible dream. 

“Yeah. There were these two boys in my room. And they were mean.” 

“What did they do?” I asked. 

“I don’t remember,” Josh said, avoiding my eyes. “I just remember 
they were scary.” 

“And what happened?” I asked, turning to the mirror to brush my hair. 

“I woke up,” he said. And then added impatiently, “Come on. Let’s 

go.” 

“Did the boys say anything to you?” I asked. 

“No. I don’t think so,” he answered thoughtfully. “They just laughed.” 

“Laughed?” 

“Well, giggled, sort of,” Josh said. “I don’t want to talk about it 
anymore,” he snapped. “Are we going for this dumb walk, or not?” 

“Okay. I’m ready,” I said, putting down my brush, taking one last look 
in the mirror. “Let’s go on this dumb walk.” 

I followed him down the hall. As we passed the stack of clothes on the 
landing, I thought about the girl I had seen standing there. And I thought 
about the boy in the window when we first arrived. And the two boys Josh 
had seen in his dream. 

I decided it proved that Josh and I were both really nervous about 
moving to this new place. Maybe Mom and Dad were right. We were letting 
our imaginations run away with us. 

It had to be our imaginations. 

I mean, what else could it be?

A few seconds later, we stepped into the backyard to get Petey. He was as 
glad to see us as ever, leaping on us with his muddy paws, yapping 
excitedly, running in frantic circles through the leaves. It cheered me up just 
to see him. 

It was hot and muggy even though the sky was gray. There was no 
wind at all. The heavy, old trees stood as still as statues. 

We headed down the gravel driveway toward the street, our sneakers 
kicking at the dead, brown leaves, Petey running in zigzags at our sides, 
first in front of us, then behind. “At least Dad hasn’t asked us to rake all 
these old leaves,” Josh said. 

“He will,” I warned. “I don’t think he’s unpacked the rake yet.” 

Josh made a face. We stood at the curb, looking up at our house, the 
two second-floor bay windows staring back at us like eyes. 

The house next door, I noticed for the first time, was about the same 
size as ours, except it was shingle instead of brick. The curtains in the living 
room were drawn shut. Some of the upstairs windows were shuttered. Tall 
trees cast the neighbors’ house in darkness, too. 

“Which way?” Josh asked, tossing a stick for Petey to chase. 

I pointed up the street. “The school is up that way,” I said. “Let’s check 
it out.” 

The road sloped uphill. Josh picked up a small tree branch from the 
side of the road and used it as a walking stick. Petey kept trying to chew on 
it while Josh walked. 

We didn’t see anyone on the street or in any of the front yards we 
passed. No cars went by. 

I was beginning to think the whole town was deserted, until the boy 
stepped out from behind the low ledge. 

He popped out so suddenly, both Josh and I stopped in our tracks. 
“Hi,” he said shyly, giving us a little wave. 

“Hi,” Josh and I answered at the same time. 

Then, before we could pull him back, Petey ran up to the boy, sniffed 
his sneakers, and began snarling and barking. The boy stepped back and 



raised his hands as if he were protecting himself. He looked really 
frightened. 

“Petey—stop!” I cried. 

Josh grabbed the dog and picked him up, but he kept growling. 

“He doesn’t bite,” I told the boy. “He usually doesn’t bark, either. I’m 
sorry.” 

“That’s okay,” the boy said, staring at Petey, who was squirming to get 
out of Josh’s arms. “He probably smells something on me.” 

“Petey, stop!” I shouted. The dog wouldn’t stop squirming. “You don’t 
want the leash—do you?” 

The boy had short, wavy blond hair and very pale blue eyes. He had a 
funny turned-up nose that seemed out of place on his serious-looking face. 
He was wearing a maroon long-sleeved sweatshirt despite the mugginess of 
the day, and black straight-legged jeans. He had a blue baseball cap stuffed 
into the back pocket of his jeans. 

“I’m Amanda Benson,” I said. “And this is my brother Josh.” 

Josh hesitantly put Petey back on the ground. The dog yipped once, 
stared up at the boy, whimpered softly, then sat down on the street and 
began to scratch himself. 

“I’m Ray Thurston,” the boy said, stuffing his hands into his jeans 
pockets, still staring warily at Petey. He seemed to relax a little, though, 
seeing that the dog had lost interest in barking and growling at him. 

I suddenly realized that Ray looked familiar. Where had I seen him 
before? Where? I stared hard at him until I remembered. 

And then I gasped in sudden fright. 

Ray was the boy, the boy in my room. The boy in the window. 

“You—” I stammered accusingly. “You were in our house!” 

He looked confused. “Huh?” 

“You were in my room—right?” I insisted. 

He laughed. “I don’t get it,” he said. “In your room?” 

Petey raised his head and gave a low growl in Ray’s direction. Then he 
went back to his serious scratching. 

“I thought I saw you,” I said, beginning to feel a little doubtful. Maybe 
it wasn’t him. Maybe.... 

“I haven’t been in your house in a long time,” Ray said, looking down 
warily at Petey. 



“A long time?” 

“Yeah. I used to live in your house,” he replied. 

“Huh?” Josh and I stared at him in surprise. “Our house?” 

Ray nodded. “When we first moved here,” he said. He picked up a flat 
pebble and heaved it down the street. 

Petey growled, started to chase it, changed his mind, and plopped back 
down on the street, his stub of a tail wagging excitedly. 

Heavy clouds lowered across the sky. It seemed to grow darker. 
“Where do you live now?” I asked. 

Ray tossed another stone, then pointed up the road. 

“Did you like our house?” Josh asked Ray. 

“Yeah, it was okay,” Ray told him. “Nice and shady.” 

“You liked it?” Josh cried. “I think it’s gross. It’s so dark and—” 

Petey interrupted. He decided to start barking at Ray again, running up 
till he was a few inches in front of Ray, then backing away. Ray took a few 
cautious steps back to the edge of the curb. 

Josh pulled the leash from the pocket of his shorts. “Sorry, Petey,” he 
said. I held the growling dog while Josh attached the leash to his collar. 

“He’s never done this before. Really,” I said, apologizing to Ray. 

The leash seemed to confuse Petey. He tugged against it, pulling Josh 
across the street. But at least he stopped barking. 

“Let’s do something,” Josh said impatiently. 

“Like what?” Ray asked, relaxing again now that Petey was on the 
leash. 

We all thought for a while. 

“Maybe we could go to your house,” Josh suggested to Ray. 

Ray shook his head. “No. I don’t think so,” he said. “Not now 
anyway.” 

“Where is everyone?” I asked, looking up and down the empty street. 
“It’s really dead around here, huh?” 

He chuckled. “Yeah. I guess you could say that,” he said. “Want to go 
to the playground behind the school?” 

“Yeah. Okay,” I agreed. 

The three of us headed up the street, Ray leading the way, me walking 
a few feet behind him, Josh holding his tree branch in one hand, the leash in 
the other, Petey running this way, then that, giving Josh a really hard time. 



We didn’t see the gang of kids till we turned the corner. 

There were ten or twelve of them, mostly boys but a few girls, too. 
They were laughing and shouting, shoving each other playfully as they 
came toward us down the center of the street. Some of them, I saw, were 
about my age. The rest were teenagers. They were wearing jeans and dark 
T-shirts. One of the girls stood out because she had long, straight blonde 
hair and was wearing green spandex tights. 

“Hey, look!” a tall boy with slicked-back black hair cried, pointing at 
us. 

Seeing Ray, Josh, and me, they grew quiet but didn’t stop moving 
toward us. A few of them giggled, as if they were enjoying some kind of 
private joke. 

The three of us stopped and watched them approach. I smiled and 
waited to say hi. Petey was pulling at his leash and barking his head off. 

“Hi, guys,” the tall boy with the black hair said, grinning. The others 
thought this was very funny for some reason. They laughed. The girl in the 
green tights gave a short, red-haired boy a shove that almost sent him 
sprawling into me. 

“How’s it going, Ray?” a girl with short black hair asked, smiling at 

Ray. 

“Not bad. Hi, guys,” Ray answered. He turned to Josh and me. “These 
are some of my friends. They’re all from the neighborhood.” 

“Hi,” I said, feeling awkward. I wished Petey would stop barking and 
pulling at his leash like that. Poor Josh was having a terrible time holding 
onto him. 

“This is George Carpenter,” Ray said, pointing to the short, red-haired 
boy, who nodded. “And Jerry Franklin, Karen Somerset, Bill Gregory...” 
He went around the circle, naming each kid. I tried to remember all the 
names but, of course it was impossible. 

“How do you like Dark Falls?” one of the girls asked me. 

“I don’t really know,” I told her. “It’s my first day here, really. It seems 
nice.” 

Some of the kids laughed at my answer, for some reason. 

“What kind of dog is that?” George Carpenter asked Josh. 

Josh, holding tight to the leash handle, told him. George stared hard at 
Petey, studying him, as if he had never seen a dog like Petey before. 



Karen Somerset, a tall, pretty girl with short blonde hair, came up to 
me while some of the other kids were admiring Petey. “You know, I used to 
live in your house,” she said softly. 

“What?” I wasn’t sure I’d heard her correctly. 

“Let’s go to the playground,” Ray said, interrupting. 

No one responded to Ray’s suggestion. 

They grew quiet. Even Petey stopped barking. 

Had Karen really said that she used to live in our house? I wanted to 
ask her, but she had stepped back into the circle of kids. 

The circle. 

My mouth dropped open as I realized they had formed a circle around 
Josh and me. 

I felt a stab of fear. Was I imagining it? Was something going on? 

They all suddenly looked different to me. They were smiling, but their 
faces were tense, watchful, as if they expected trouble. 

Two of them, I noticed, were carrying baseball bats. The girl with the 
green tights stared at me, looking me up and down, checking me out. 

No one said a word. The street was silent except for Petey, who was 
now whimpering softly. 

I suddenly felt very afraid. 

Why were they staring at us like that? 

Or was my imagination running away with me again? 

I turned to Ray, who was still beside me. He didn’t seem at all 
troubled. But he didn’t return my gaze. 

“Hey, guys—” I said. “What’s going on?” I tried to keep it light, but 
my voice was a little shaky. 

I looked over at Josh. He was busy soothing Petey and hadn’t noticed 
that things had changed. 

The two boys with baseball bats held them up waist high and moved 
forward. 

I glanced around the circle, feeling the fear tighten my chest. 

The circle tightened. The kids were closing in on us. 



10 


The black clouds overhead seemed to lower. The air felt heavy and damp. 

Josh was fussing with Petey’s collar and still didn’t see what was 
happening. I wondered if Ray was going to say anything, if he was going to 
do anything to stop them. But he stayed frozen and expressionless beside 
me. 

The circle grew smaller as the kids closed in. 

I realized I’d been holding my breath. I took a deep breath and opened 
my mouth to cry out. 

“Hey, kids—what’s going on?” 

It was a man’s voice, calling from outside the circle. 

Everyone turned to see Mr. Dawes coming quickly toward us, taking 
long strides as he crossed the street, his open blazer flapping behind him. 
He had a friendly smile on his face. “What’s going on?” he asked again. 

He didn’t seem to realize that the gang of kids had been closing in on 
Josh and me. 

“We’re heading to the playground,” George Carpenter told him, 
twirling the bat in his hand. “You know. To play softball.” 

“Good deal,” Mr. Dawes said, pulling down his striped tie, which had 
blown over his shoulder. He looked up at the darkening sky. “Hope you 
don’t get rained out.” 

Several of the kids had backed up. They were standing in small groups 
of two and three now. The circle had completely broken up. 

“Is that bat for softball or hardball?” Mr. Dawes asked George. 

“George doesn’t know,” another kid replied quickly. “He’s never hit 
anything with it!” 

The kids all laughed. George playfully menaced the kid, pretending to 
come at him with the bat. 

Mr. Dawes gave a little wave and started to leave. But then he stopped, 
and his eyes opened wide with surprise. “Hey,” he said, flashing me a 
friendly smile. “Josh. Amanda. I didn’t see you there.” 

“Good morning,” I muttered. I was feeling very confused. A moment 
ago, I’d felt terribly scared. Now everyone was laughing and kidding 



around. 

Had I imagined that the kids were moving in on us? Ray and Josh 
hadn’t seemed to notice anything peculiar. Was it just me and my overactive 
imagination? 

What would have happened if Mr. Dawes hadn’t come along? 

“How are you two getting along in the new house?” Mr. Dawes asked, 
smoothing back his wavy blond hair. 

“Okay,” Josh and I answered together. Looking up at Mr. Dawes, 
Petey began to bark and pull at the leash. 

Mr. Dawes put an exaggerated hurt expression on his face. “I’m 
crushed,” he said. “Your dog still doesn’t like me.” He bent over Petey. 
“Hey, dog—lighten up.” 

Petey barked back angrily. 

“He doesn’t seem to like anybody today,” I told Mr. Dawes 
apologetically. 

Mr. Dawes stood back up and shrugged. “Can’t win ’em all.” He 
started back to his car, parked a few yards down the street. “I’m heading 
over to your house,” he told Josh and me. “Just want to see if there’s 
anything I can do to help your parents. Have fun, kids.” 

I watched him climb into his car and drive away. 

“He’s a nice guy,” Ray said. 

“Yeah,” I agreed. I was still feeling uncomfortable, wondering what 
the kids would do now that Mr. Dawes was gone. 

Would they form that frightening circle again? 

No. Everyone started walking, heading down the block to the 
playground behind the school. They were kidding each other and talking 
normally, and pretty much ignored Josh and me. 

I was starting to feel a little silly. It was obvious that they hadn’t been 
trying to scare Josh and me. I must have made the whole thing up in my 
mind. 

I must have. 

At least, I told myself, I hadn’t screamed or made a scene. At least I 
hadn’t made a total fool of myself. 

The playground was completely empty. I guessed that most kids had 
stayed inside because of the threatening sky. The playground was a large, 
flat grassy field, surrounded on all four sides by a tall metal fence. There 



were swings and slides at the end nearest the school building. There were 
two baseball diamonds on the other end. Beyond the fence, I could see a 
row of tennis courts, also deserted. 

Josh tied Petey to the fence, then came running over to join the rest of 

us. The boy named Jerry Franklin made up the teams. Ray and I were on 
the same team. Josh was on the other. 

As our team took the field, I felt excited and a little nervous. I’m not 
the best softball player in the world. I can hit the ball pretty well. But in the 
field, I’m a complete klutz. Luckily, Jerry sent me out to right field where 
not many balls are hit. 

The clouds began to part a little and the sky got lighter. We played two 
full innings. The other team was winning, eight to two. I was having fun. 

I had only messed up on one play. And I hit a double my first time at 

bat. 

It was fun being with a whole new group of kids. They seemed really 
nice, especially the girl named Karen Somerset, who talked with me while 
we waited for our turn at bat. Karen had a great smile, even though she 
wore braces on all her teeth, up and down. She seemed very eager to be 
friends. 

The sun was coming out as my team started to take the field for the 
beginning of the third inning. Suddenly, I heard a loud, shrill whistle. I 
looked around until I saw that it was Jerry Franklin, blowing a silver 
whistle. 

Everyone came running up to him. “We’d better quit,” he said, looking 
up at the brightening sky. “We promised our folks, remember, that we’d be 
home for lunch.” 

I glanced at my watch. It was only eleven-thirty. Still early. 

But to my surprise, no one protested. 

They all waved to each other and called out farewells, and then began 
to run. I couldn’t believe how fast everyone left. It was as if they were 
racing or something. 

Karen ran past me like the others, her head down, a serious expression 
on her pretty face. Then she stopped suddenly and turned around. “Nice 
meeting you, Amanda,” she called back. “We should get together 
sometime.” 

“Great!” I called to her. “Do you know where I live?” 



I couldn’t hear her answer very well. She nodded, and I thought she 
said, “Yes. I know it. I used to live in your house.” 

But that couldn’t have been what she said. 



11 


Several days went by. Josh and I were getting used to our new house and 
our new friends. 

The kids we met every day at the playground weren’t exactly friends 
yet. They talked with Josh and me, and let us on their teams. But it was 
really hard to get to know them. 

In my room, I kept hearing whispers late at night, and soft giggling, 
but I forced myself to ignore it. One night, I thought I saw a girl dressed all 
in white at the end of the upstairs hall. But when I walked over to 
investigate, there was just a pile of dirty sheets and other bedclothes against 
the wall. 

Josh and I were adjusting, but Petey was still acting really strange. We 
took him with us to the playground every day, but we had to leash him to 
the fence. Otherwise, he’d bark and snap at all the kids. 

“He’s still nervous being in a new place,” I told Josh. “He’ll calm 
down.” 

But Petey didn’t calm down. And about two weeks later, we were 
finishing up a softball game with Ray, and Karen Somerset, and Jerry 
Franklin, and George Carpenter, and a bunch of other kids, when I looked 
over to the fence and saw that Petey was gone. 

Somehow he had broken out of his leash and run away. 

We looked for hours, calling “Petey!” wandering from block to block, 
searching front yards and backyards, empty lots and woods. Then, after 
circling the neighborhood twice, Josh and I suddenly realized we had no 
idea where we were. 

The streets of Dark Falls looked the same. They were all lined with 
sprawling old brick or shingle houses, all filled with shady old trees. 

“I don’t believe it. We’re lost,” Josh said, leaning against a tree trunk, 
trying to catch his breath. 

“That stupid dog,” I muttered, my eyes searching up the street. “Why 
did he do this? He’s never run away before.” 

“I don’t know how he got loose,” Josh said, shaking his head, then 
wiping his sweaty forehead with the sleeve of his T-shirt. “I tied him up 



really well.” 

“Hey—maybe he ran home,” I said. The idea immediately cheered me 
up. 

“Yeah!” Josh stepped away from the tree and headed back over to me. 
“HI bet you’re right, Amanda. He’s probably been home for hours. Wow. 
We’ve been stupid. We should’ve checked home first. Let’s go!” 

“Well,” I said, looking around at the empty yards, “we just have to 
figure out which way is home.” 

I looked up and down the street, trying to figure out which way we’d 
turned when we left the school playground. I couldn’t remember, so we just 
started walking. 

Luckily, as we reached the next corner, the school came into sight. We 
had made a full circle. It was easy to find our way from there. 

Passing the playground, I stared at the spot on the fence where Petey 
had been tied. That troublemaking dog. He’d been acting so badly ever 
since we came to Dark Falls. 

Would he be home when we got there? I hoped so. 

A few minutes later, Josh and I were running up the gravel driveway, 
calling the dog’s name at the top of our lungs. The front door burst open 
and Mom, her hair tied in a red bandanna, the knees of her jeans covered 
with dust, leaned out. She and Dad had been painting the back porch. 
“Where have you two been? Lunchtime was two hours ago!” 

Josh and I both answered at the same time. “Is Petey here?” 

“We’ve been looking for Petey!” 

“Is he here?” 

Mom’s face filled with confusion. “Petey? I thought he was with you.” 

My heart sank. Josh slumped to the driveway with a loud sigh, 
sprawling flat on his back in the gravel and leaves. 

“You haven’t seen him?” I asked, my trembling voice showing my 
disappointment. “He was with us. But he ran away.” 

“Oh. I’m sorry,” Mom said, motioning for Josh to get up from the 
driveway. “He ran away? I thought you’ve been keeping him on a leash.” 

“You’ve got to help us find him,” Josh pleaded, not budging from the 
ground. “Get the car. We’ve got to find him—right now!” 

“I’m sure he hasn’t gotten far,” Mom said. “You must be starving. 
Come in and have some lunch and then we’ll—” 



“No. Right now!” Josh screamed. 

“What’s going on?” Dad, his face and hair covered with tiny flecks of 
white paint, joined Mom on the front porch. “Josh—what’s all the yelling?” 

We explained to Dad what had happened. He said he was too busy to 
drive around looking for Petey. Mom said she’d do it, but only after we had 
some lunch. I pulled Josh up by both arms and dragged him into the house. 

We washed up and gulped down some peanut butter and jelly 
sandwiches. Then Mom took the car out of the garage, and we drove around 
and around the neighborhood searching for our lost pet. 

With no luck. 

No sign of him. 

Josh and I were miserable. Heartbroken. Mom and Dad called the local 
police. Dad kept saying that Petey had a good sense of direction, that he’d 
show up any minute. 

But we didn’t really believe it. 

Where was he? 

The four of us ate dinner in silence. It was the longest, most horrible 
evening of my life. “I tied him up really good,” Josh repeated, close to 
tears, his dinner plate still full. 

“Dogs are great escape artists,” Dad said, “Don’t worry. He’ll show 

up.” 

“Some night for a party,” Mom said glumly. 

I’d completely forgotten that they were going out. Some neighbors on 
the next block had invited them to a big potluck dinner party. 

“I sure don’t feel like partying, either,” Dad said with a sigh. “I’m beat 
from painting all day. But I guess we have to be neighborly. Sure you kids 
will be okay here?” 

“Yeah, I guess,” I said, thinking about Petey. I kept listening for his 
bark, listening for scratching at the door. 

But no. The hours dragged by. Petey still hadn’t shown up by bedtime. 

Josh and I both slinked upstairs. I felt really tired, weary from all the 
worrying, and the running around and searching for Petey, I guess. But I 
knew I’d never be able to get to sleep. 

In the hall outside my bedroom door, I heard whispering from inside 
my room and quiet footsteps. The usual sounds my room made. I wasn’t at 
all scared of them or surprised by them anymore. 



Without hesitating, I stepped into my room and clicked on the light. 
The room was empty, as I knew it would be. The mysterious sounds 
disappeared. I glanced at the curtains, which lay straight and still. 

Then I saw the clothes strewn all over my bed. 

Several pairs of jeans. Several T-shirts. A couple of sweatshirts. My 
only dress-up skirt. 

That’s strange, I thought. Mom was such a neat freak. If she had 
washed these things, she surely would have hung them up or put them into 
dresser drawers. 

Sighing wearily, I started to gather up the clothes and put them away. I 
figured that Mom simply had too much to do to be bothered. She had 
probably washed the stuff and then left it here for me to put away. Or she 
had put it all down, planning to come back later and put it away, and then 
got busy with other chores. 

Half an hour later, I was tucked into my bed wide awake, staring at the 
shadows on the ceiling. 

Some time after that—I lost track of the time—I was still wide awake, 
still thinking about Petey, thinking about the new kids I’d met, thinking 
about the new neighborhood, when I heard my bedroom door creak and 
swing open. 

Footsteps on the creaking floorboards. 

I sat up in the darkness as someone crept into my room. 

“Amanda—ssshh—it’s me.” 

Alarmed, it took me a few seconds to recognize the hushed whisper. 
“Josh! What do you want? What are you doing in here?” 

I gasped as a blinding light forced me to cover my eyes. “Oops. 
Sorry,” Josh said. “My flashlight. I didn’t mean to—” 

“Ow, that’s bright,” I said, blinking. He aimed the powerful beam of 
white light up at the ceiling. 

“Yeah. It’s a halogen flashlight,” he said. 

“Well, what do you want?” I asked irritably. I still couldn’t see well. I 
mbbed my eyes, but it didn’t help. 

“I know where Petey is,” Josh whispered, “and I’m going to go get 
him. Come with me?” 

“Huh?” I looked at the little clock on my bed table. “It’s after 
midnight, Josh.” 



“So? It won’t take long. Really.” 

My eyes were nearly normal by now. Staring at Josh in the light from 
the halogen flashlight, I noticed for the first time that he was fully dressed 
in jeans and a long-sleeved T-shirt. 

“I don’t get it, Josh,” I said, swinging around and putting my feet on 
the floor. “We looked everywhere. Where do you think Petey is?” 

“In the cemetery,” Josh answered. His eyes looked big and dark and 
serious in the white light. 

“Huh?” 

“That’s where he ran the first time, remember? When we first came to 
Dark Falls? He ran to that cemetery just past the school.” 

“Now, wait a minute—” I started. 

“We drove past it this afternoon, but we didn’t look inside. He’s there, 
Amanda. I know he is. And I’m going to go get him whether you come or 
not.” 

“Josh, calm down,” I said, putting my hands on his narrow shoulders. I 
was surprised to discover that he was trembling. “There’s no reason for 
Petey to be in that cemetery.” 

“That’s where he went the first time,” Josh insisted. “He was looking 
for something there that day. I could tell. I know he’s there again, Amanda.” 
He pulled away from me. “Are you coming or not?” 

My brother has to be the stubbornest, most headstrong person in the 
world. 

“Josh, you’re really going to walk into a strange cemetery so late at 
night?” I asked. 

“I’m not afraid,” he said, shining the bright light around my room. 

For a brief second, I thought the light caught someone, lurking behind 
the curtains. I opened my mouth to cry out. But there was no one there. 

“You coming or not?” he repeated impatiently. 

I was going to say no. But then, glancing at the curtains, I thought, it’s 
probably no more spooky out there in that cemetery than it is here in my 
own bedroom! 

“Yeah. Okay,” I said grudgingly. “Get out of here and let me get 
dressed.” 

“Okay,” he whispered, turning off the flashlight, plunging us into 
blackness. “Meet me down at the end of the driveway.” 



“Josh—one quick look at the cemetery, then we hurry home. Got it?” I 
told him. 

“Yeah. Right. We’ll be home before Mom and Dad get back from that 
party.” He crept out. I could hear him making his way quickly down the 
stairs. 

This is the craziest idea ever, I told myself as I searched in the 
darkness for some clothes to pull on. 

And it was also kind of exciting. 

Josh was wrong. No doubt about it. Petey wouldn’t be hanging around 
in that cemetery now. Why on earth should he? 

But at least it wasn’t a long walk. And it was an adventure. Something 
to write about to Kathy back home. 

And if Josh happened to be right, and we did manage to find poor, lost 
Petey, well, that would be great, too. 

A few minutes later, dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt, I crept out of the 
house and joined Josh at the bottom of the driveway. The night was still 
warm. A heavy blanket of clouds covered the moon. I realized for the first 
time that there were no streetlights on our block. 

Josh had the halogen flashlight on, aimed down at our feet. “You 
ready?” he asked. 

Dumb question. Would I be standing there if I weren’t ready? 

We crunched over dead leaves as we headed up the block, toward the 
school. From there, it was just two blocks to the cemetery. 

“It’s so dark,” I whispered. The houses were black and silent. There 
was no breeze at all. It was as if we were all alone in the world. 

“It’s too quiet,” I said, hurrying to keep up with Josh. “No crickets or 
anything. Are you sure you really want to go to the cemetery?” 

“I’m sure,” he said, his eyes following the circle of light from the 
flashlight as it bumped over the ground. “I really think Petey is there.” 

We walked in the street, keeping close to the curb. We had gone nearly 
two blocks. The school was just coming into sight on the next block when 
we heard the scraping steps behind us on the pavement. 

Josh and I both stopped. He lowered the light. 

We both heard the sounds. I wasn’t imagining them. 

Someone was following us. 



12 


Josh was so startled, the flashlight tumbled from his hand and clattered onto 
the street. The light flickered but didn’t go out. 

By the time Josh had managed to pick it up, our pursuer had caught up 
to us. I spun around to face him, my heart pounding in my chest. 

“Ray! What are you doing here?” 

Josh aimed the light at Ray’s face, but Ray shot his arms up to shield 
his face and ducked back into the darkness. “What are you two doing here?” 
he cried, sounding almost as startled as I did. 

“You—you scared us,” Josh said angrily, aiming the flashlight back 
down at our feet. 

“Sorry,” Ray said, “I would’ve called out, but I wasn’t sure it was 
you.” 

“Josh has this crazy idea about where Petey might be,” I told him, still 
struggling to catch my breath. “That’s why we’re out here.” 

“What about you?” Josh asked Ray. 

“Well, sometimes I have trouble sleeping,” Ray said softly. 

“Don’t your parents mind you being out so late?” I asked. 

In the glow from the flashlight, I could see a wicked smile cross his 
face. “They don’t know.” 

“Are we going to the cemetery or not?” Josh asked impatiently. 
Without waiting for an answer, he started jogging up the road, the light 
bobbing on the pavement in front of him. I turned and followed, wanting to 
stay close to the light. 

“Where are you going?” Ray called, hurrying to catch up. 

“The cemetery,” I called back. 

“No,” Ray said. “You’re not.” 

His voice was so low, so threatening, that I stopped. “What?” 

“You’re not going there,” Ray repeated. I couldn’t see his face. It was 
hidden in darkness. But his words sounded menacing. 

“Hurry!” Josh called back to us. He hadn’t slowed down. He didn’t 
seem to notice the threat in Ray’s words. 

“Stop, Josh!” Ray called. It sounded more like an order than a request. 



“You can’t go there!” 

“Why not?” I demanded, suddenly afraid. Was Ray threatening Josh 
and me? Did he know something we didn’t? Or was I making a big deal out 
of nothing once again? 

I stared into the darkness, trying to see his face. 

“You’d be nuts to go there at night!” he declared. 

I began to think I had misjudged him. He was afraid to go there. That’s 
why he was trying to stop us. 

“Are you coming or not?” Josh demanded, getting farther and farther 
ahead of us. 

“I don’t think we should,” Ray warned. 

Yes, he’s afraid, I decided. I only imagined that he was threatening us. 

“You don’t have to. But we do,” Josh insisted, picking up his speed. 

“No. Really,” Ray said. “This is a bad idea.” But now he and I were 
running side by side to catch up with Josh. 

“Petey’s there,” Josh said, “I know he is.” 

We passed the dark, silent school. It seemed much bigger at night. 
Josh’s light flashed through the low tree branches as we turned the corner 
onto Cemetery Drive. 

“Wait—please,” Ray pleaded. But Josh didn’t slow down. Neither did 
1.1 was eager to get there and get it over with. 

I wiped my forehead with my sleeve. The air was hot and still. I 
wished I hadn’t worn long sleeves. I felt my hair. It was dripping wet. 

The clouds still covered the moon as we reached the cemetery. We 
stepped through a gate in the low wall. In the darkness, I could see the 
crooked rows of gravestones. 

Josh’s light traveled from stone to stone, jumping up and down as he 
walked. “Petey!” he called suddenly, interrupting the silence. 

He’s disturbing the sleep of the dead, I thought, feeling a sudden chill 
of fear. 

Don’t be silly, Amanda. “Petey!” I called, too, forcing away my 
morbid thoughts. 

“This is a very bad idea,” Ray said, standing very close to me. 

“Petey! Petey!” Josh called. 

“I know it’s a bad idea,” I admitted to Ray. “But I didn’t want Josh to 
come here by himself.” 



“But we shouldn’t be here,” Ray insisted. 

I was beginning to wish he’d go away. No one had forced him to 
come. Why was he giving us such a hard time? 

“Hey—look at this!” Josh called from several yards up ahead. 

My sneakers crunching over the soft ground, I hurried between the 
rows of graves. I hadn’t realized that we had already walked the entire 
length of the graveyard. 

“Look,” Josh said again, his flashlight playing over a strange structure 
built at the edge of the cemetery. 

It took me a little while to figure out what it was in the small circle of 
light. It was so unexpected. It was some kind of theater. An amphitheater, I 
guess you’d call it, circular rows of bench seats dug into the ground, 
descending like stairs to a low stagelike platform at the bottom. 

“What on earth!” I exclaimed. 

I started forward to get a closer look. 

“Amanda—wait. Let’s go home,” Ray called. He grabbed at my arm, 
but I hurried away, and he grabbed only air. 

“Weird! Who would build an outdoor theater at the edge of a 
cemetery?” I asked. 

I looked back to see if Josh and Ray were following me, and my 
sneaker caught against something. I stumbled to the ground, hitting my 
knee hard. 

“Ow. What was that?” 

Josh shone the light on it as I climbed slowly, painfully, to my feet. I 
had tripped over an enormous, upraised tree root. 

In the flickering light, I followed the gnarled root over to a wide, old 
tree several yards away. The huge tree was bent over the strange below¬ 
ground theater, leaning at such a low angle that it looked likely to topple 
over at any second. Big clumps of roots were raised up from the ground. 
Overhead, the tree’s branches, heavy with leaves, seemed to lean to the 
ground. 

“Timberrr!” Josh yelled. 

“How weird!” I exclaimed. “Hey, Ray—what is this place?” 

“It’s a meeting place,” Ray said quietly, standing close beside me, 
staring straight ahead at the leaning tree. “They use it sort of like a town 
hall. They have town meetings here.” 



“In the cemetery?” I cried, finding it hard to believe. 

“Let’s go,” Ray urged, looking very nervous. 

All three of us heard the footsteps. They were behind us, somewhere in 
the rows of graves. We turned around. Josh’s light swept over the ground. 

“Petey!” 

There he was, standing between the nearest row of low, stone grave 
markers. I turned happily to Josh. “I don’t believe it!” I cried. “You were 
right!” 

“Petey! Petey!” Josh and I both started running toward our dog. 

But Petey arched back on his hind legs as if he were getting ready to 
mn away. He stared at us, his eyes red as jewels in the light of the 
flashlight. 

“Petey! We found you!” I cried. 

The dog lowered his head and started to trot away. 

“Petey! Hey—come back! Don’t you recognize us?” 

With a burst of speed, Josh caught up with him and grabbed him up off 
the ground. “Hey, Petey, what’s the matter, fella?” 

As I hurried over, Josh dropped Petey back to the ground and stepped 
back. “Ooh—he stinks!” 

“What?” I cried. 

“Petey—he stinks. He smells like a dead rat!” Josh held his nose. 

Petey started to walk slowly away. 

“Josh, he isn’t glad to see us,” I wailed. “He doesn’t even seem to 
recognize us. Look at him!” 

It was true. Petey walked to the next row of gravestones, then turned 
and glared at us. 

I suddenly felt sick. What had happened to Petey? Why was he acting 
so differently? Why wasn’t he glad to see us? 

“I don’t get it,” Josh said, still making a face from the odor the dog 
gave off. “Usually, if we leave the room for thirty seconds, he goes nuts 
when we come back.” 

“We’d better go!” Ray called. He was still at the edge of the cemetery 
near the leaning tree. 

“Petey—what’s wrong with you?” I called to the dog. He didn’t 
respond. “Don’t you remember your name? Petey? Petey?” 

“Yuck! What a stink!” Josh exclaimed. 



“We’ve got to get him home and give him a bath,” I said. My voice 
was shaking. I felt really sad. And frightened. 

“Maybe this isn’t Petey,” Josh said thoughtfully. The dog’s eyes again 
glared red in the beam of light. 

“It’s him all right,” I said quietly. “Look. He’s dragging the leash. Go 
get him, Josh—and let’s go home.” 

“You get him!” Josh cried. “He smells too bad!” 

“Just grab his leash. You don’t have to pick him up,” I said. 

“No. You.” 

Josh was being stubborn again. I could see that I had no choice. 
“Okay,” I said. “I’ll get him. But I’ll need the light.” I grabbed the flashlight 
from Josh’s hand and started to run toward Petey. 

“Sit, Petey. Sit!” I ordered. It was the only command Petey ever 
obeyed. 

But he didn’t obey it this time. Instead, he turned and trotted away, 
holding his head down low. 

“Petey—stop! Petey, come on!” I yelled, exasperated. “Don’t make me 
chase you.” 

“Don’t let him get away!” Josh yelled, running up behind me. 

I moved the flashlight from side to side along the ground. “Where is 

he?” 

“Petey! Petey!” Josh called, sounding shrill and desperate. 

I couldn’t see him. 

“Oh, no. Don’t tell me we’ve lost him again!” I said. 

We both started to call him. “What’s wrong with that mutt?” I cried. 

I moved the beam of light down one long row of gravestones, then, 
moving quickly, down the next. No sign of him. We both kept calling his 
name. 

And then the circle of light came to rest on the front of a granite 
tombstone. 

Reading the name on the stone, I stopped short. 

And gasped. 

“Josh—look!” I grabbed Josh’s sleeve. I held on tight. 

“Huh? What’s wrong?” His face filled with confusion. 

“Look! The name on the gravestone.” 

It was Karen Somerset. 



Josh read the name. He stared at me, still confused. 

“That’s my new friend Karen. The one I talk to on the playground 
every day,” I said. 

“Huh? It must be her grandmother or something,” Josh said, and then 
added impatiently, “Come on. Look for Petey.” 

“No. Look at the dates,” I said to him. 

We both read the dates under Karen Somerset’s name. 1960-1972. 

“It can’t be her mother or grandmother,” I said, keeping the beam of 
light on the stone despite my trembling hand. “This girl died when she was 
twelve. My age. And Karen is twelve, too. She told me.” 

“Amanda—” Josh scowled and looked away. 

But I took a few steps and beamed the light onto the next gravestone. 
There was a name on it I’d never heard before. I moved on to the next 
stone. Another name I’d never heard. 

“Amanda, come on!” Josh whined. 

The next gravestone had the name George Carpenter on it. 1975-1988. 

“Josh—look! It’s George from the playground,” I called. 

“Amanda, we have to get Petey,” he insisted. 

But I couldn’t pull myself away from the gravestones. I went from one 
to the next, moving the flashlight over the engraved letters. 

To my growing horror, I found Jerry Franklin. And then Bill Gregory. 

All the kids we had played softball with. They all had gravestones 

here. 

My heart thudding, I moved down the crooked row, my sneakers 
sinking into the soft grass. I felt numb, numb with fear. I struggled to hold 
the light steady as I beamed it onto the last stone in the row. 

RAY THURSTON. 1977-1988. 

“Huh?” 

I could hear Josh calling me, but I couldn’t make out what he was 
saying. 

The rest of the world seemed to fall away. I read the deeply etched 
inscription again: 

RAY THURSTON. 1977-1988. 

I stood there, staring at the letters and numbers. I stared at them till 
they didn’t make sense anymore, until they were just a gray blur. 

Suddenly, I realized that Ray had crept up beside the gravestone and 



was staring at me. 

“Ray—” I managed to say, moving the light over the name on the 
stone. “Ray, this one is... you!” 

His eyes flared, glowing like dying embers. 

“Yes, it’s me,” he said softly, moving toward me. “I’m so sorry, 
Amanda.” 



13 


I took a step back, my sneakers sinking into the soft ground. The air was 
heavy and still. No one made a sound. Nothing moved. 

Dead. 

I’m surrounded by death, I thought. 

Then, frozen to the spot, unable to breathe, the darkness swirling 
around me, the gravestones spinning in their own black shadows, I thought: 
What is he going to do to me? 

“Ray—” I managed to call out. My voice sounded faint and far away. 
“Ray, are you really dead?” 

“I’m sorry. You weren’t supposed to find out yet,” he said, his voice 
floating low and heavy on the stifling night air. 

“But—how? I mean... I don’t understand....” I looked past him to the 
darting white light of the flashlight. Josh was several rows away, almost to 
the street, still searching for Petey. 

“Petey!” I whispered, dread choking my throat, my stomach tightening 
in horror. 

“Dogs always know,” Ray said in a low, flat tone. “Dogs always 
recognize the living dead. That’s why they have to go first. They always 
know.” 

“You mean—Petey’s... dead?” I choked out the words. 

Ray nodded. “They kill the dogs first.” 

“No!” I screamed and took another step back, nearly losing my 
balance as I bumped into a low marble gravestone. I jumped away from it. 

“You weren’t supposed to see this,” Ray said, his narrow face 
expressionless except for his dark eyes, which revealed real sadness. “You 
weren’t supposed to know. Not for another few weeks, anyway. I’m the 
watcher. I was supposed to watch, to make sure you didn’t see until it was 
time.” 

He took a step toward me, his eyes lighting up red, burning into mine. 

“Were you watching me from the window?” I cried. “Was that you in 
my room?” 

Again he nodded yes. “I used to live in your house,” he said, taking 



another step closer, forcing me back against the cold marble stone. “I’m the 
watcher.” 

I forced myself to look away, to stop staring into his glowing eyes. I 
wanted to scream to Josh to run and get help. But he was too far away. And 
I was frozen there, frozen with fear. 

“We need fresh blood,” Ray said. 

“What?” I cried. “What are you saying?” 

“The town—it can’t survive without fresh blood. None of us can. 
You’ll understand soon, Amanda. You’ll understand why we had to invite 
you to the house, to the... Dead House.” 

In the darting, zigzagging beam of light, I could see Josh moving 
closer, heading our way. 

Run, Josh, I thought. Run away. Fast. Get someone. Get anyone. 

I could think the words. Why couldn’t I scream them? 

Ray’s eyes glowed brighter. He was standing right in front of me now, 
his features set, hard and cold. 

“Ray?” Even through my jeans, the marble gravestone felt cold against 
the back of my legs. 

“I messed up,” he whispered. “I was the watcher. But I messed up.” 

“Ray—what are you going to do?” 

His red eyes flickered. “I’m really sorry.” 

He started to raise himself off the ground, to float over me. 

I could feel myself start to choke. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move. I 
opened my mouth to call out to Josh, but no sound came out. 

Josh? Where was he? 

I looked down the rows of gravestones but couldn’t see his light. 

Ray floated up a little higher. He hovered over me, choking me 
somehow, blinding me, suffocating me. 

I’m dead, I thought. Dead. 

Now I’m dead, too. 



14 


And then, suddenly, light broke through the darkness. 

The light shone in Ray’s face, the bright white halogen light. 

“What’s going on?” Josh asked, in a high-pitched, nervous voice. 
“Amanda—what’s happening?” 

Ray cried out and dropped back to the ground. “Turn that off! Turn it 
off!” he screeched, his voice a shrill whisper, like wind through a broken 
windowpane. 

But Josh held the bright beam of light on Ray. “What’s going on? 
What are you doing?” 

I could breathe again. As I stared into the light, I struggled to stop my 
heart from pounding so hard. 

Ray moved his arms to shield himself from the light. But I could see 
what was happening to him. The light had already done its damage. 

Ray’s skin seemed to be melting. His whole face sagged, then fell, 
dropping off his skull. 

I stared into the circle of white light, unable to look away, as Ray’s 
skin folded and drooped and melted away. As the bone underneath was 
revealed, his eyeballs rolled out of their sockets and fell silently to the 
ground. 

Josh, frozen in horror, somehow held the bright light steady, and we 
both stared at the grinning skull, its dark craters staring back at us. 

“Oh!” I shrieked as Ray took a step toward me. 

But then I realized that Ray wasn’t walking. He was falling. 

I jumped aside as he crumpled to the ground. And gasped as his skull 
hit the top of the marble gravestone, and cracked open with a sickening 
splat. 

“Come on!” Josh shouted. “Amanda—come on!” He grabbed my hand 
and tried to pull me away. 

But I couldn’t stop staring down at Ray, now a pile of bones inside a 
puddle of crumpled clothes. 

“Amanda, come on!” 

Then, before I even realized it, I was running, running beside Josh as 



fast as I could down the long row of graves toward the street. The light 
flashed against the blur of gravestones as we ran, slipping on the soft, dew- 
covered grass, gasping in the still, hot air. 

“We’ve got to tell Mom and Dad. Got to get away from here!” I cried. 

“They—they won’t believe it!” Josh said, as we reached the street. We 
kept running, our sneakers thudding hard against the pavement. “I’m not 
sure I believe it myself!” 

“They’ve got to believe us!” I told him. “If they don’t, we’ll drag them 
out of that house.” 

The white beam of light pointed the way as we ran through the dark, 
silent streets. There were no streetlights, no lights on in the windows of the 
houses we passed, no car headlights. 

Such a dark world we had entered. 

And now it was time to get out. 

We ran the rest of the way home. I kept looking back to see if we were 
being followed. But I didn’t see anyone. The neighborhood was still and 
empty. 

I had a sharp pain in my side as we reached home. But I forced myself 
to keep running, up the gravel driveway with its thick blanket of dead 
leaves, and onto the front porch. 

I pushed open the door and both Josh and I started to scream. “Mom! 
Dad! Where are you?” 

Silence. 

We ran into the living room. The lights were all off. 

“Mom? Dad? Are you here?” 

Please be here, I thought, my heart racing, the pain in my side still 
sharp. Please be here. 

We searched the house. They weren’t home. 

“The potluck party,” Josh suddenly remembered. “Can they still be at 
that party?” 

We were standing in the living room, both of us breathing hard. The 
pain in my side had let up just a bit. I had turned on all the lights, but the 
room still felt gloomy and menacing. 

I glanced at the clock on the mantel. Nearly two in the morning. 

“They should be home by now,” I said, my voice shaky and weak. 

“Where did they go? Did they leave a number?” Josh was already on 



his way to the kitchen. 

I followed him, turning on lights as we went. We went right to the 
memo pad on the counter where Mom and Dad always leave us notes. 

Nothing. The pad was blank. 

“We’ve got to find them!” Josh cried. He sounded very frightened. His 
wide eyes reflected his fear. “We have to get away from here.” 

What if something has happened to them? 

That’s what I started to say. But I caught myself just in time. I didn’t 
want to scare Josh any more than he was already. 

Besides, he’d probably thought of that, too. 

“Should we call the police?” he asked, as we walked back to the living 
room and peered out the front window into the darkness. 

“I don’t know,” I said, pressing my hot forehead against the cool glass. 
“I just don’t know what to do. I want them to be home. I want them here so 
we can all leave.” 

“What’s your hurry?” a girl’s voice said from behind me. 

Josh and I both cried out and spun around. 

Karen Somerset was standing in the center of the room, her arms 
crossed over her chest. 

“But—you’re dead!” I blurted out. 

She smiled, a sad smile, a bitter smile. 

And then two more kids stepped in from the hallway. One of them 
clicked off the lights. “Too bright in here,” he said. They moved next to 
Karen. 

And another kid, Jerry Franklin—another dead kid—appeared by the 
fireplace. And I saw the girl with short black hair, the one I had seen on the 
stairs, move beside me by the curtains. 

They were all smiling, their eyes glowing dully in the dim light, all 
moving in on Josh and me. 

“What do you wantl” I screamed in a voice I didn’t even recognize. 
“What are you going to do?” 

“We used to live in your house,” Karen said softly. 

“Huh?” I cried. 

“We used to live in your house,” George said. 

“And now, guess what?” Jerry added. “Now we’re dead in your 
house! ” 



The others started to laugh, crackling, dry laughs, as they all closed in 
on Josh and me. 



15 


“They’re going to kill us!” Josh cried. 

I watched them move forward in silence. Josh and I had backed up to 
the window. I looked around the dark room for an escape route. 

But there was nowhere to run. 

“Karen—you seemed so nice,” I said. The words just tumbled out. I 
hadn’t thought before I said them. 

Her eyes glowed a little brighter. “I was nice,” she said in a glum 
monotone, “until I moved here.” 

“We were all nice,” George Carpenter said in the same low monotone. 
“But now we’re dead.” 

“Let us go!” Josh cried, raising his hands in front of him as if to shield 
himself. “Please—let us go.” 

They laughed again, the dry, hoarse laughter. Dead laughter. 

“Don’t be scared, Amanda,” Karen said. “Soon you’ll be with us. 
That’s why they invited you to this house.” 

“Huh? I don’t understand,” I cried, my voice shaking. 

“This is the Dead House. This is where everyone lives when they first 
arrive in Dark Falls. When they’re still alive.” 

This seemed to strike the others as funny. They all snickered and 
laughed. 

“But our great-uncle—” Josh started. 

Karen shook her head, her eyes glowing with amusement. “No. Sorry, 
Josh. No great-uncle. It was just a trick to bring you here. Once every year, 
someone new has to move here. Other years, it was us. We lived in this 
house—until we died. This year, it’s your turn.” 

“We need new blood,” Jerry Franklin said, his eyes glowing red in the 
dim light. “Once a year, you see, we need new blood.” 

Moving forward in silence, they hovered over Josh and me. 

I took a deep breath. A last breath, perhaps. And shut my eyes. 

And then I heard the knock on the door. 

Aloud knock, repeated several times. 

I opened my eyes. The ghostly kids all vanished. 



The air smelled sour. 

Josh and I stared at each other, dazed, as the loud knocking started 
again. 

“It’s Mom and Dad!” Josh cried. 

We both ran to the door. Josh stumbled over the coffee table in the 
dark, so I got to the door first. 

“Mom! Dad!” I cried, pulling open the door. “Where have you been?” 

I reached out my arms to hug them both—and stopped with my arms 
in the air. My mouth dropped open and I uttered a silent cry. 

“Mr. Dawes!” Josh exclaimed, coming up beside me. “We thought—” 

“Oh, Mr. Dawes, I’m so glad to see you!” I cried happily, pushing 
open the screen door for him. 

“Kids—you’re okay?” he asked, eyeing us both, his handsome face 
tight with worry. “Oh, thank God!” he cried. “I got here in time!” 

“Mr. Dawes—” I started, feeling so relieved, I had tears in my eyes. “I 

He grabbed my arm. “There’s no time to talk,” he said, looking behind 
him to the street. I could see his car in the driveway. The engine was 
running. Only the parking lights were on. “I’ve got to get you kids out of 
here while there’s still time.” 

Josh and I started to follow him, then hesitated. 

What if Mr. Dawes was one of them? 

“Hurry,” Mr. Dawes urged, holding open the screen door, gazing 
nervously out into the darkness. “I think we’re in terrible danger.” 

“But—” I started, staring into his frightened eyes, trying to decide if 
we could trust him. 

“I was at the party with your parents,” Mr. Dawes said. “All of a 
sudden, they formed a circle. Everyone. Around your parents and me. They 
—they started to close in on us.” 

Just like when the kids started to close in on Josh and me, I thought. 

“We broke through them and ran,” Mr. Dawes said, glancing to the 
driveway behind him. “Somehow the three of us got away. Hurry. We’ve all 
got to get away from here—now!” 

“Josh, let’s go,” I urged. Then I turned to Mr. Dawes. “Where are 
Mom and Dad?” 

“Come on. I’ll show you. They’re safe for now. But I don’t know for 



how long.” 

We followed him out of the house and down the driveway to his car. 
The clouds had parted. A sliver of moon shone low in a pale, early morning 
sky. 

“There’s something wrong with this whole town,” Mr. Dawes said, 
holding the front passenger door open for me as Josh climbed into the back. 

I slumped gratefully into the seat, and he slammed the door shut. “I 
know,” I said, as he slid behind the wheel. “Josh and I. We both—” 

“We’ve got to get as far away as we can before they catch up with us,” 
Mr. Dawes said, backing down the drive quickly, the tires sliding and 
squealing as he pulled onto the street. 

“Yes,” I agreed. “Thank goodness you came. My house—it’s filled 
with kids. Dead kids and—” 

“So you’ve seen them,” Mr. Dawes said softly, his eyes wide with fear. 
He pushed down harder on the gas pedal. 

As I looked out into the purple darkness, a low, orange sun began to 
show over the green treetops. “Where are our parents?” I asked anxiously. 

“There’s a kind of outdoor theater next to the cemetery,” Mr. Dawes 
said, staring straight ahead through the windshield, his eyes narrow, his 
expression tense. “It’s built right into the ground, and it’s hidden by a big 
tree. I left them there. I told them not to move. I think they’ll be safe. I 
don’t think anyone’ll think to look there.” 

“We’ve seen it,” Josh said. A bright light suddenly flashed on in the 
backseat. 

“What’s that?” Mr. Dawes asked, looking into the rearview mirror. 

“My flashlight,” Josh answered, clicking it off. “I brought it just in 
case. But the sun will be up soon. I probably won’t need it.” 

Mr. Dawes hit the brake and pulled the car to the side of the road. We 
were at the edge of the cemetery. I climbed quickly out of the car, eager to 
see my parents. 

The sky was still dark, streaked with violet now. The sun was a dark 
orange balloon just barely poking over the trees. Across the street, beyond 
the jagged rows of gravestones, I could see the dark outline of the leaning 
tree that hid the mysterious amphitheater. 

“Hurry,” Mr. Dawes urged, closing his car door quietly. “I’m sure your 
parents are desperate to see you.” 



We headed across the street, half-walking, half-jogging, Josh swinging 
the flashlight in one hand. 

Suddenly, at the edge of the cemetery grass, Josh stopped. “Petey!” he 
cried. 

I followed his gaze, and saw our white terrier walking slowly along a 
slope of gravestones. 

“Petey!” Josh yelled again, and began running to the dog. 

My heart sank. I hadn’t had a chance to tell Josh what Ray had 
revealed to me about Petey. “No—Josh!” I called. 

Mr. Dawes looked very alarmed. “We don’t have time. We have to 
hurry,” he said to me. Then he began shouting for Josh to come back. 

“I’ll go get him,” I said, and took off, running as fast as I could along 
the rows of graves, calling to my brother. “Josh! Josh, wait up! Don’t! 
Don’t go after him! Josh—Petey is dead!” 

Josh had been gaining on the dog, which was ambling along, sniffing 
the ground, not looking up, not paying any attention to Josh. Then suddenly, 
Josh tripped over a low grave marker. 

He cried out as he fell, and the flashlight flew out of his hand and 
clattered against a gravestone. 

I quickly caught up with him. “Josh—are you okay?” 

He was lying on his stomach, staring straight ahead. 

“Josh—answer me. Are you okay?” 

I grabbed him by the shoulders and tried to pull him up, but he kept 
staring straight ahead, his mouth open, his eyes wide. 

“Josh?” 

“Look,” he said finally. 

I breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Josh wasn’t knocked out or 
something. 

“Look,” he repeated, and pointed to the gravestone he had tripped 

over. 

I turned and squinted at the grave. I read the inscription, silently 
mouthing the words as I read: 

COMPTON DAWES. R.I.P. 1950-1980. 

My head began to spin. I felt dizzy. I steadied myself, holding onto 

Josh. 


COMPTON DAWES. 



It wasn’t his father or his grandfather. He had told us he was the only 
Compton in his family. 

So Mr. Dawes was dead, too. 

Dead. Dead. Dead. 

Dead as everyone else. 

He was one of them. One of the dead ones. 

Josh and I stared at each other in the purple darkness. Surrounded. 
Surrounded by the dead. 

Now what? I asked myself. 

Now what? 



16 


“Get up, Josh,” I said, my voice a choked whisper. “We’ve got to get away 
from here.” 

But we were too late. 

A hand grabbed me firmly by the shoulder. 

I spun around to see Mr. Dawes, his eyes narrowing as he read the 
inscription on his own gravestone. 

“Mr. Dawes—you, too!” I cried, so disappointed, so confused, so... 
scared. 

“Me, too,” he said, almost sadly. “All of us.” His eyes burned into 
mine. “This was a normal town once. And we were normal people. Most of 
us worked in the plastics factory on the outskirts of town. Then there was 
an accident. Something escaped from the factory. A yellow gas. It floated 
over the town. So fast we didn’t see it... didn’t realize. And then, it was too 
late, and Dark Falls wasn’t a normal town anymore. We were all dead, 
Amanda. Dead and buried. But we couldn’t rest. We couldn’t sleep. Dark 
Falls was a town of living dead.” 

“What—what are you going to do to us?” I managed to ask. My knees 
were trembling so hard, I could barely stand. A dead man was squeezing 
my shoulder. A dead man was staring hard into my eyes. 

Standing this close, I could smell his sour breath. I turned my head, but 
the smell already choked my nostrils. 

“Where are Mom and Dad?” Josh asked, climbing to his feet and 
standing rigidly across from us, glaring accusingly at Mr. Dawes. 

“Safe and sound,” Mr. Dawes said with a faint smile. “Come with me. 
It’s time for you to join them.” 

I tried to pull away from him, but his hand was locked on my shoulder. 
“Let go!” I shouted. 

His smile grew wider. “Amanda, it doesn’t hurt to die,” he said softly, 
almost soothingly. “Come with me.” 

“No!” Josh shouted. And with sudden quickness, he dived to the 
ground and picked up his flashlight. 

“Yes!” I cried. “Shine it on him, Josh!” The light could save us. The 



light could defeat Mr. Dawes, as it had Ray. The light could destroy him. 
“Quick—shine it on him!” I pleaded. 

Josh fumbled with the flashlight, then pointed it toward Mr. Dawes’ 
startled face, and clicked it on. 

Nothing. 

No light. 

“It—it’s broken,” Josh said. “I guess when it hit the gravestone....” 

My heart pounding, I looked back at Mr. Dawes. The smile on his face 
was a smile of victory. 



17 


“Nice try,” Mr. Dawes said to Josh. The smile faded quickly from his face. 

Close up, he didn’t look so young and handsome. His skin, I could see, 
was dry and peeling and hung loosely beneath his eyes. 

“Let’s go, kids,” he said, giving me a shove. He glanced up at the 
brightening sky. The sun was raising itself over the treetops. 

Josh hesitated. 

“I said let’s go,” Mr. Dawes snapped impatiently. He loosened his grip 
on my shoulder and took a menacing step toward Josh. 

Josh glanced down at the worthless flashlight. Then he pulled his arm 
back and heaved the flashlight at Mr. Dawes’ head. 

The flashlight hit its target with a sickening crack. It hit Mr. Dawes in 
the center of his forehead, splitting a large hole in the skin. 

Mr. Dawes uttered a low cry. His eyes widened in surprise. Dazed, he 
reached a hand up to the hole where a few inches of gray skull poked 
through. 

“Run, Josh!” I cried. 

But there was no need to tell him that. He was already zigzagging 
through the rows of graves, his head ducked low. I followed him, running as 
fast as I could. 

Glancing back, I saw Mr. Dawes stagger after us, still holding his 
ripped forehead. He took several steps, then abruptly stopped, staring up at 
the sky. 

It’s too bright for him, I realized. He has to stay in the shade. 

Josh had ducked down behind a tall marble monument, old and 
slightly tilted, cracked down the middle. I slid down beside him, gasping 
for breath. 

Leaning on the cool marble, we both peered around the sides of the 
monument. Mr. Dawes, a scowl on his face, was heading back toward the 
amphitheater, keeping in the shadows of the trees. 

“He—he’s not chasing us,” Josh whispered, his chest heaving as he 
struggled to catch his breath and stifle his fear. “He’s going back.” 

“The sun is too bright for him,” I said, holding onto the side of the 



monument. “He must be going to get Mom and Dad.” 

“That stupid flashlight,” Josh cried. 

“Never mind that,” I said, watching Mr. Dawes until he disappeared 
behind the big leaning tree. “What are we going to do now? I don’t know 

“Shhh. Look!” Josh poked me hard on the shoulder, and pointed. 
“Who’s that?” 

I followed his stare and saw several dark figures hurrying through the 
rows of tombstones. They seemed to have appeared from out of nowhere. 

Did they rise out of the graves? 

Walking quickly, seeming to float over the green, sloping ground, they 
headed into the shadows. All were walking in silence, their eyes straight 
ahead. They didn’t stop to greet one another. They strode purposefully 
toward the hidden amphitheater, as if they were being drawn there, as if 
they were puppets being pulled by hidden strings. 

“Whoa. Look at them all!” Josh whispered, ducking his head back 
behind the marble monument. 

The dark, moving forms made all the shadows ripple. It looked as if 
the trees, the gravestones, the entire cemetery had come to life, had started 
toward the hidden seats of the amphitheater. 

“There goes Karen,” I whispered, pointing. “And George. And all the 
rest of them.” 

The kids from our house were moving quickly in twos and threes, 
following the other shadows, as silent and businesslike as everyone else. 

Everyone was here except Ray, I thought. 

Because we killed Ray. 

We killed someone who was already dead. 

“Do you think Mom and Dad are really down in that weird theater?” 
Josh asked, interrupting my morbid thoughts, his eyes on the moving 
shadows. 

“Come on,” I said, taking Josh’s hand and pulling him away from the 
monument. “We’ve got to find out.” 

We watched the last of the dark figures float past the enormous leaning 
tree. The shadows stopped moving. The cemetery was still and silent. A 
solitary crow floated, high above in the clear blue, cloudless sky. 

Slowly, Josh and I edged our way toward the amphitheater, ducking 



behind gravestones, keeping low to the ground. 

It was a struggle to move. I felt as if I weighed five hundred pounds. 
The weight of my fear, I guess. 

I was desperate to see if Mom and Dad were there. 

But at the same time, I didn’t want to see. 

I didn’t want to see them being held prisoner by Mr. Dawes and the 
others. 

I didn’t want to see them... killed. 

The thought made me stop. I reached out an arm and halted Josh. 

We were standing behind the leaning tree, hidden by its enormous 
clump of upraised roots. Beyond the tree, down in the theater below, I could 
hear the low murmur of voices. 

“Are Mom and Dad there?” Josh whispered. He started to poke his 
head around the side of the bent tree trunk, but I cautiously pulled him 
back. 

“Be careful,” I whispered. “Don’t let them see you. They’re practically 
right beneath us.” 

“But I’ve got to know if Mom and Dad are really here,” he whispered, 
his eyes frightened, pleading. 

“Me, too,” I agreed. 

We both leaned over the massive trunk. The bark felt smooth under my 
hands as I gazed into the deep shadows cast by the tree. 

And then I saw them. 

Mom and Dad. They were tied up, back-to-back, standing in the center 
of the floor at the bottom of the amphitheater in front of everyone. 

They looked so uncomfortable, so terrified. Their arms were tied 
tightly down at their sides. Dad’s face was bright red. Mom’s hair was all 
messed up, hanging wildly down over her forehead, her head bowed. 

Squinting into the darkness cast by the tree, I saw Mr. Dawes standing 
beside them along with another, older man. And I saw that the rows of long 
benches built into the ground were filled with people. Not a single empty 
space. 

Everyone in town must be here, I realized. 

Everyone except Josh and me. 

“They’re going to kill Mom and Dad,” Josh whispered, grabbing my 
arm, squeezing it in fear. “They’re going to make Mom and Dad just like 



them.” 

“Then they’ll come after us,” I said, thinking out loud, staring through 
the shadows at my poor parents. Both of them had their heads bowed now 
as they stood before the silent crowd. Both of them were awaiting their 
fates. 

“What are we going to do?” Josh whispered. 

“Huh?” I was staring so hard at Mom and Dad, I guess I momentarily 
blanked out. 

“What are we going to do?” Josh repeated urgently, still holding 
desperately to my arm. “We can’t just stand here and—” 

I suddenly knew what we were going to do. 

It just came to me. I didn’t even have to think hard. 

“Maybe we can save them,” I whispered, backing away from the tree. 
“Maybe we can do something.” 

Josh let go of my arm. He stared at me eagerly. 

“We’re going to push this tree over,” I whispered with so much 
confidence that I surprised myself. “We’re going to push the tree over so 
the sunlight will fill the amphitheater.” 

“Yes!” Josh cried immediately. “Look at this tree. It’s practically down 
already. We can do it!” 

I knew we could do it. I don’t know where my confidence came from. 
But I knew we could do it. 

And I knew we had to do it fast. 

Peering over the top of the trunk again, struggling to see through the 
shadows, I could see that everyone in the theater had stood up. They were 
all starting to move forward, down toward Mom and Dad. 

“Come on, Josh,” I whispered. “We’ll take a running jump, and push 
the tree over. Come on!” 

Without another word, we both took several steps back. 

We just had to give the trunk a good, hard push, and the tree would 
topple right over. The roots were already almost entirely up out of the 
ground, after all. 

One hard push. That’s all it would take. And the sunlight would pour 
into the theater. Beautiful, golden sunlight. Bright, bright sunlight. 

The dead people would all crumble. 

And Mom and Dad would be saved. 



All four of us would be saved. 

“Come on, Josh,” I whispered. “Ready?” 

He nodded, his face solemn, his eyes frightened. 

“Okay. Let’s go!” I cried. 

We both ran forward, digging our sneakers into the ground, moving as 
fast as we could, our arms outstretched and ready. 

In a second, we hit the tree trunk and pushed with all of our strength, 
shoving it with our hands and then moving our shoulders into it, pushing... 
pushing... pushing... 

It didn’t budge. 



18 


“Push!” I cried. “Push it again!” 

Josh let out an exasperated, defeated sigh. “I can’t, Amanda. I can’t 
move it.” 

“Josh—” I glared at him. 

He backed up to try again. 

Below, I could hear startled voices, angry voices. 

“Quick!” I yelled. “Push!” 

We hurtled into the tree trunk with our shoulders, both of us grunting 
from the effort, our muscles straining, our faces bright red. 

“Push! Keep pushing!” 

The veins at my temples felt about to pop. 

Was the tree moving? 

No. 

It gave a little, but bounced right back. 

The voices from below were getting louder. 

“We can’t do it!” I cried, so disappointed, so frustrated, so terrified. 
“We can’t move it!” 

Defeated, I slumped over onto the tree trunk, and started to bury my 
face in my hands. 

I pulled back with a gasp when I heard the soft cracking sound. The 
cracking sound grew louder until it was a rumble, then a roar. It sounded as 
if the ground were ripping apart. 

The old tree fell quickly. It didn’t have far to fall. But it hit with a 
thundering crash that seemed to shake the ground. 

I grabbed Josh and we both stood in amazement and disbelief as bright 
sunlight poured into the amphitheater. 

The cries went up instantly. Horrified cries. Angry cries. Frantic cries. 

The cries became howls. Howls of pain, of agony. 

The people in the amphitheater, the living dead caught in the golden 
light, began scrambling over one another, screeching, pulling, climbing, 
pushing, trying to claw their way to shade. 



But it was too late. 

Their skin began to drop off their bones and, as I stared open-mouthed, 
they crumbled to powder and dissolved to the ground, their clothes 
disintegrating along with them. 

The painful cries continued to ring out as the bodies fell apart, the skin 
melted away, the dry bones collapsed. I saw Karen Somerset staggering 
across the floor. I saw her hair fall to the ground in a heap, revealing the 
dark skull underneath. She cast a glance up at me, a longing look, a look of 
regret. And then her eyeballs rolled out of their sockets, and she opened her 
toothless mouth, and she cried, “Thank you, Amanda! Thank you!” and 
collapsed. 

Josh and I covered our ears to shut out the ghastly cries. We both 
looked away, unable to keep watching the entire town fall in agony and 
crumble to powder, destroyed by the sun, the clear, warm sun. 

When we looked back, they had all disappeared. 

Mom and Dad were standing right where they had been, tied back-to- 
back, their expressions a mixture of horror and disbelief. 

“Mom! Dad!” I cried. 

I’ll never forget their smiles as Josh and I ran forward to free them. 

It didn’t take our parents long to get us packed up and to arrange for the 
movers to take us back to our old neighborhood and our old house. “I guess 
it’s lucky after all that we couldn’t sell the old place,” Dad said, as we 
eagerly piled into the car to leave. 

Dad backed down the driveway and started to roar away. 

“Stop!” I cried suddenly. I’m not sure why, but I had a sudden, 
powerful urge to take one last look at the old house. 

As both of my parents called out to me in confusion, I pushed open the 
door and jogged back to the driveway. Standing in the middle of the yard, I 
stared up at the house, silent, empty, still covered in thick layers of blue- 
gray shadows. 

I found myself gazing up at the old house as if I were hypnotized. I 
don’t know how long I stood there. 

The crunch of tires on the gravel driveway snapped me out of my 
spell. Startled, I turned to see a red station wagon parked in the driveway. 

Two boys about Josh’s age jumped out of the back. Their parents 



followed. Staring up at the house, they didn’t seem to notice me. 

“Here we are, kids,” the mother said, smiling at them. “Our new 
house.” 

“It doesn’t look new. It looks old,” one of the boys said. 

And then his brother’s eyes widened as he noticed me. “Who are you?” 
he demanded. 

The other members of his family turned to stare at me. 

“Oh. I... uh...” His question caught me by surprise. I could hear my 
dad honking his horn impatiently down on the street. “I... uh... used to live 
in your house,” I found myself answering. 

And then I turned and ran full speed down to the street. 

Wasn’t that Mr. Dawes standing at the porch, clipboard in hand? I 
wondered, catching a glimpse of a dark figure as I ran to the car. 

No, it couldn’t be Mr. Dawes up there waiting for them, I decided. 

It just couldn’t be. 

I didn’t look back. I slammed the car door behind me, and we sped 
away. 




STAY OUT OF 
THE BASEMENT 

Goosebumps - 02 
R.L. Stine 





1 


“Hey, Dad—catch!” 

Casey tossed the Frisbee across the smooth, green lawn. Casey’s dad made 
a face, squinting into the sun. The Frisbee hit the ground and skipped a few 
times before landing under the hedge at the back of the house. 

“Not today. I’m busy,” Dr. Brewer said, and abruptly turned and loped into 
the house. The screen door slammed behind him. 

Casey brushed his straight blond hair back off his forehead. “What’s his 
problem?” he called to Margaret, his sister, who had watched the whole scene 
from the side of the redwood garage. 

“You know,” Margaret said quietly. She wiped her hands on the legs of her 
jeans and held them both up, inviting a toss. “I’ll play Frisbee with you for a 
little while,” she said. 

“Okay,” Casey said without enthusiasm. He walked slowly over to retrieve 
the Frisbee from under the hedge. 

Margaret moved closer. She felt sorry for Casey. He and their dad were 
really close, always playing ball or Frisbee or Nintendo together. But Dr. Brewer 
didn’t seem to have time for that anymore. 

Jumping up to catch the Frisbee, Margaret realized she felt sorry for herself, 
too. Dad hadn’t been the same to her, either. In fact, he spent so much time down 
in the basement, he barely said a word to her. 

He doesn’t even call me Princess anymore, Margaret thought. It was a 
nickname she hated. But at least it was a nickname, a sign of closeness. 

She tossed the red Frisbee back. A bad toss. Casey chased after it, but it 
sailed away from him. Margaret looked up to the golden hills beyond their 
backyard. 

California, she thought. 

It’s so weird out here. Here it is, the middle of winter, and there isn’t a 
cloud in the sky, and Casey and I are out in jeans and T-shirts as if it were the 
middle of summer. 

She made a diving catch for a wild toss, rolling over on the manicured lawn 
and raising the Frisbee above her head triumphantly. 

“Show off,” Casey muttered, unimpressed. 



“You’re the hot dog in the family,” Margaret called. 

“Well, you’re a dork.” 

“Hey, Casey—you want me to play with you or not?” 

He shrugged. 

Everyone was so edgy these days, Margaret realized. 

It was easy to figure out why. 

She made a high toss. The Frisbee sailed over Casey’s head. “You chase it!” 
he cried angrily, putting his hands on his hips. 

“No, you!” she cried. 

“You!” 

“Casey—you’re eleven years old. Don’t act like a two-year-old,” she 
snapped. 

“Well, you act like a one- year-old,” was his reply as he grudgingly went 
after the Frisbee. 

It was all Dad’s fault, Margaret realized. Things had been so tense ever 
since he started working at home. Down in the basement with his plants and 
weird machines. He hardly ever came up for air. 

And when he did, he wouldn’t even catch a Frisbee. 

Or spend two minutes with either of them. 

Mom had noticed it, too, Margaret thought, running full-out and making 
another grandstand catch just before colliding with the side of the garage. 

Having Dad home has made Mom really tense, too. She pretends 
everything is fine. But I can tell she’s worried about him. 

“Fucky catch, Fatso!” Casey called. 

Margaret hated the name Fatso even more than she hated Princess. People 
in her family jokingly called her Fatso because she was so thin, like her father. 
She also was tall like him, but she had her mother’s straight brown hair, brown 
eyes, and dark coloring. 

“Don’t call me that.” She heaved the red disc at him. He caught it at his 
knees and flipped it back to her. 

They tossed it back and forth without saying much for another ten or fifteen 
minutes. “I’m getting hot,” Margaret said, shielding her eyes from the afternoon 
sun with her hand. “Fet’s go in.” 

Casey tossed the Frisbee against the garage wall. It dropped onto the grass. 
He came trotting over to her. “Dad always plays longer,” he said peevishly. “And 
he throws better. You throw like a girl.” 



“Give me a break,” Margaret groaned, giving him a playful shove as she 
jogged to the back door. “You throw like a chimpanzee.” 

“How come Dad got fired?” he asked. 

She blinked. And stopped running. The question had caught her by surprise. 
“Huh?” 

His pale, freckled face turned serious. “You know. I mean, why?” he asked, 
obviously uncomfortable. 

She and Casey had never discussed this in the four weeks since Dad had 
been home. Which was unusual since they were pretty close, being only a year 
apart. 

“I mean, we came all the way out here so he could work at PolyTech, 
right?” Casey asked. 

“Yeah. Well... he got fired,” Margaret said, half-whispering in case her dad 
might be able to hear. 

“But why? Did he blow up the lab or something?” Casey grinned. The idea 
of his dad blowing up a huge campus science lab appealed to him. 

“No, he didn’t blow anything up,” Margaret said, tugging at a strand of dark 
hair. “Botanists work with plants, you know. They don’t get much of a chance to 
blow things up.” 

They both laughed. 

Casey followed her into the narrow strip of shade cast by the low ranch- 
style house. 

“I’m not sure exactly what happened,” Margaret continued, still half- 
whispering. “But I overheard Dad on the phone. I think he was talking to Mr. 
Martinez. His department head. Remember? The quiet little man who came to 
dinner that night the barbecue grill caught fire?” 

Casey nodded. “Martinez fired Dad?” 

“Probably,” Margaret whispered. “From what I overheard, it had something 
to do with the plants Dad was growing, some experiments that had gone wrong 
or something.” 

“But Dad’s real smart,” Casey insisted, as if Margaret were arguing with 
him. “If his experiments went wrong, he’d know how to fix them.” 

Margaret shrugged. “That’s all I know,” she said. “Come on, Casey. Let’s 
go inside. I’m dying of thirst!” She stuck her tongue out and moaned, 
demonstrating her dire need of liquid. 

“You’re gross,” Casey said. He pulled open the screen door, then dodged in 



front of her so he could get inside first. 

“Who’s gross?” Mrs. Brewer asked from the sink. She turned to greet the 
two of them. “Don’t answer that.” 

Mom looks very tired today, Margaret thought, noticing the crisscross of 
fine lines at the corners of her mother’s eyes and the first strands of gray in her 
mother’s shoulder-length brown hair. “I hate this job,” Mrs. Brewer said, turning 
back to the sink. 

“What are you doing?” Casey asked, pulling open the refrigerator and 
removing a box of juice. 

“I’m deveining shrimp.” 

“Yuck!” Margaret exclaimed. 

“Thanks for the support,” Mrs. Brewer said dryly. The phone rang. Wiping 
her shrimpy hands with a dish towel, she hurried across the room to pick up the 
phone. 

Margaret got a box of juice from the fridge, popped the straw into the top, 
and followed Casey into the front hallway. The basement door, usually shut tight 
when Dr. Brewer was working down there, was slightly ajar. 

Casey started to close it, then stopped. “Let’s go down and see what Dad is 
doing,” he suggested. 

Margaret sucked the last drops of juice through the straw and squeezed the 
empty box flat in her hand. “Okay.” 

She knew they probably shouldn’t disturb their father, but her curiosity got 
the better of her. He had been working down there for four weeks now. All kinds 
of interesting equipment, lights, and plants had been delivered. Most days he 
spent at least eight or nine hours down there, doing whatever it was he was 
doing. And he hadn’t shown it to them once. 

“Yeah. Let’s go,” Margaret said. It was their house, too, after all. 

Besides, maybe their dad was just waiting for them to show some interest. 
Maybe he was hurt that they hadn’t bothered to come downstairs in all this time. 

She pulled the door open the rest of the way, and they stepped onto the 
narrow stairway. “Hey, Dad—” Casey called excitedly. “Dad—can we see?” 

They were halfway down when their father appeared at the foot of the 
stairs. He glared up at them angrily, his skin strangely green under the 
fluorescent light fixture. He was holding his right hand, drops of red blood 
falling onto his white lab coat. 

“Stay out of the basement!” he bellowed, in a voice they’d never heard 



before. 

Both kids shrank back, surprised to hear their father scream like that. He 
was usually so mild and soft-spoken. 

“Stay out of the basement, ” he repeated, holding his bleeding hand. “Don’t 
ever come down here—I’m warning you.”

“Okay. All packed,” Mrs. Brewer said, dropping her suitcases with a thud in the 
front hallway. She poked her head into the living room where the TV was 
blaring. “Do you think you could stop the movie for one minute to say good-bye 
to your mother?” 

Casey pushed a button on the remote control, and the screen went blank. He 
and Margaret obediently walked to the hallway to give their mother hugs. 

Margaret’s friend, Diane Manning, who lived just around the corner, 
followed them into the hallway. “How long are you going to be gone, Mrs. 
Brewer?” she asked, her eyes on the two bulging suitcases. 

“I don’t know,” Mrs. Brewer replied fretfully. “My sister went into the 
hospital in Tucson this morning. I guess I’ll have to stay until she’s able to go 
home.” 

“Well, I’ll be glad to baby-sit for Casey and Margaret while you’re away,” 
Diane joked. 

“Give me a break,” Margaret said, rolling her eyes. “I’m older than you are, 
Diane.” 

“And I’m smarter than both of you,” Casey added with typical modesty. 

“I’m not worried about you kids,” Mrs. Brewer said, glancing nervously at 
her watch. “I’m worried about your father.” 

“Don’t worry,” Margaret told her seriously. “We’ll take good care of him.” 

“Just make sure that he eats something once in a while,” Mrs. Brewer said. 
“He’s so obsessed with his work, he doesn’t remember to eat unless you tell 
him.” 

It’s going to be really lonely around here without Mom, Margaret thought. 
Dad hardly ever comes up from the basement. 

It had been two weeks since he yelled at Casey and her to stay out of the 
basement. They had been tiptoeing around ever since, afraid to get him angry 
again. But in the past two weeks, he had barely spoken to them, except for the 
occasional “good morning” and “good night.” 

“Don’t worry about anything, Mom,” she said, forcing a smile. “Just take 
good care of Aunt Eleanor.” 

“I’ll call as soon as I get to Tucson,” Mrs. Brewer said, nervously lowering 



her eyes to her watch again. She took three long strides to the basement door, 
then shouted down, “Michael—time to take me to the airport!” 

After a long wait, Dr. Brewer called up a reply. Then Mrs. Brewer turned 
back to the kids. “Think heTl even notice I’m gone?” she asked in a loud 
whisper. She meant it to be a light remark, but her eyes revealed some sadness. 

A few seconds later, they heard footsteps on the basement stairs, and their 
dad appeared. He pulled off his stained lab coat, revealing tan slacks and a bright 
yellow T-shirt, and tossed the lab coat onto the banister. Even though it was two 
weeks later, his right hand, the hand that had been bleeding, was still heavily 
bandaged. 

“Ready?” he asked his wife. 

Mrs. Brewer sighed. “I guess.” She gave Margaret and Casey a helpless 
look, then moved quickly to give them each one last hug. 

“Let’s go, then,” Dr. Brewer said impatiently. He picked up the two bags 
and groaned. “Wow. How long are you planning to stay? A year?” Then he 
headed out the front door with them, not waiting for an answer. 

“Bye, Mrs. Brewer,” Diane said, waving. “Have a good trip.” 

“How can she have a good trip?” Casey asked sharply. “Her sister’s in the 
hospital.” 

“You know what I mean,” Diane replied, tossing back her long red hair and 
rolling her eyes. 

They watched the station wagon roll down the driveway, then returned to 
the living room. Casey picked up the remote control and started the movie. 

Diane sprawled on the couch and picked up the bag of potato chips she’d 
been eating. 

“Who picked this movie?” Diane asked, crinkling the foil bag noisily. 

“I did,” Casey said. “It’s neat.” He had pulled a couch cushion down to the 
living room carpet and was lying on it. 

Margaret was sitting cross-legged on the floor, her back against the base of 
an armchair, still thinking about her mother and her aunt Eleanor. “It’s neat if 
you like to see a lot of people blown up and their guts flying all over,” she said, 
making a face for Diane’s benefit. 

“Yeah. It’s neat,” Casey said, not taking his eyes off the glowing TV screen. 

“I’ve got so much homework. I don’t know why I’m sitting here,” Diane 
said, reaching her hand into the potato chip bag. 

“Me, too,” Margaret sighed. “I guess I’ll do it after dinner. Do you have the 



math assignment? I think I left my math book at school.” 

“Sshhh!” Casey hissed, kicking a sneakered foot in Margaret’s direction. 
“This is a good part.” 

“You’ve seen this tape before?” Diane shrieked. 

“Twice,” Casey admitted. He ducked, and the sofa pillow Diane threw 
sailed over his head. 

“It’s a pretty afternoon,” Margaret said, stretching her arms above her head. 
“Maybe we should go outside. You know. Ride bikes or something.” 

“You think you’re still back in Michigan? It’s always a pretty afternoon 
here,” Diane said, chewing loudly. “I don’t even notice it anymore.” 

“Maybe we should do the math assignment together,” Margaret suggested 
hopefully. Diane was much better in math than she was. 

Diane shrugged. “Yeah. Maybe.” She crinkled up the bag and set it on the 
floor. “Your dad looked kind of nervous, you know?” 

“Huh? What do you mean?” 

“Just nervous,” Diane said. “How’s he doing?” 

“Sshhh,” Casey insisted, picking up the potato chip bag and tossing it at 
Diane. 

“You know. Being laid off and all.” 

“I guess he’s okay,” Margaret said wistfully. “I don’t know, really. He 
spends all his time down in the basement with his experiments.” 

“Experiments? Hey—let’s go take a look.” Tossing her hair back behind her 
shoulders, Diane jumped up from the chrome and white leather couch. 

Diane was a science freak. Math and science. The two subjects Margaret 
hated. 

She should have been in the Brewer family, Margaret thought with a trace 
of bitterness. Maybe Dad would pay some attention to her since she’s into the 
same things he is. 

“Come on—” Diane urged, bending over to pull Margaret up from the floor. 
“He’s a botanist, right? What’s he doing down there?” 

“It’s complicated,” Margaret said, shouting over the explosions and gunfire 
on the TV. “He tried to explain it to me once. But—” Margaret allowed Diane to 
pull her to her feet. 

“Shut up!” Casey yelled, staring at the movie, the colors from the TV 
screen reflecting over his clothes. 

“Is he building a Frankenstein monster or something?” Diane demanded. 



“Or some kind of RoboCop? Wouldn’t that be cool?” 

“Shut up!” Casey repeated shrilly as Arnold Schwarzenegger bounded 
across the screen. 

“He’s got all these machines and plants down there,” Margaret said 
uncomfortably. “But he doesn’t want us to go down there.” 

“Huh? It’s like top secret?” Diane’s emerald green eyes lit up with 
excitement. “Come on. We’ll just take a peek.” 

“No, I don’t think so,” Margaret told her. She couldn’t forget the angry look 
on her father’s face two weeks before when she and Casey had tried to pay a 
visit. Or the way he had screamed at them never to come down to the basement. 

“Come on. I dare you,” Diane challenged. “Are you chicken?” 

“I’m not afraid,” Margaret insisted shrilly. Diane was always daring her to 
do things she didn’t want to do. Why is it so important for Diane to think she’s 
so much braver than everyone else? Margaret wondered. 

“Chicken,” Diane repeated. Tossing her mane of red hair behind her 
shoulder, she strode quickly toward the basement door. 

“Diane—stop!” Margaret cried, following after her. 

“Hey, wait!” Casey cried, clicking off the movie. “Are we going 
downstairs? Wait for me!” He climbed quickly to his feet and enthusiastically 
hurried to join them at the basement door. 

“We can’t—” Margaret started, but Diane clamped a hand over her mouth. 

“We’ll take a quick peek,” Diane insisted. “We’ll just look. We won’t touch 
anything. And then we’ll come right back upstairs.” 

“Okay. I’ll go first,” Casey said, grabbing for the doorknob. 

“Why do you want to do this?” Margaret asked her friend. “Why are you so 
eager to go down there?” 

Diane shrugged. “It beats doing our math,” she replied, grinning. 

Margaret sighed, defeated. “Okay, let’s go. But remember—just looking, no 
touching.” 

Casey pulled open the door and led the way onto the stairway. Stepping 
onto the landing, they were immediately engulfed in hot, steamy air. They could 
hear the buzz and hum of electronic machinery. And off to the right, they could 
see the glare of the bright white lights from Dr. Brewer’s workroom. 

This is kind of fun, Margaret thought as the three of them made their way 
down the linoleum-covered stairway. 

It’s an adventure. 



There’s no harm in taking a peek. 

So why was her heart pounding? Why did she have this sudden tingle of 

fear? 



3 


“Yuck! It’s so hot in here!” 

As they stepped away from the stairs, the air became unbearably hot and 
thick. 

Margaret gasped. The sudden change in temperature was suffocating. 

“It’s so moist,” Diane said. “Good for your hair and skin.” 

“We studied the rain forest in school,” Casey said. “Maybe Dad’s building a 
rain forest.” 

“Maybe,” Margaret said uncertainly. 

Why did she feel so strange? Was it just because they were invading their 
father’s domain? Doing something he had told them not to do? 

She held back, gazing in both directions. The basement was divided into 
two large, rectangular rooms. To the left, an unfinished rec room stood in 
darkness. She could barely make out the outlines of the Ping-Pong table in the 
center of the room. 

The workroom to the right was brightly lit, so bright they had to blink and 
wait for their eyes to adjust. Beams of white light poured down from large 
halogen lamps on tracks in the ceiling. 

“Wow! Look!” Casey cried, his eyes wide as he stepped excitedly toward 
the light. 

Reaching up toward the lights were shiny, tall plants, dozens of them, thick- 
stalked and broad-leafed, planted close together in an enormous, low trough of 
dark soil. 

“It’s like a jungle!” Margaret exclaimed, following Casey into the white 
glare. 

The plants, in fact, resembled jungle plants—leafy vines and tall, treelike 
plants with long, slender tendrils, fragile-looking ferns, plants with gnarled, 
cream-colored roots poking up like bony knees from the soil. 

“It’s like a swamp or something,” Diane said. “Did your father really grow 
these things in just five or six weeks?” 

“Yeah. I’m pretty sure,” Margaret replied, staring at the enormous red 
tomatoes on a slender, yellow stalk. 

“Ooh. Feel this one,” Diane said. 



Margaret glanced over to find her friend rubbing her hand over a large, flat 
leaf the shape of a teardrop. “Diane—we shouldn’t touch—” 

“I know, I know,” Diane said, not letting go of the leaf. “But just rub your 
hand on it.” 

Margaret reluctantly obeyed. “It doesn’t feel like a leaf,” she said as Diane 
moved over to examine a large fern. “It’s so smooth. Like glass.” 

The three of them stood under the bright, white lights, examining the plants 
for several minutes, touching the thick stalks, running their hands over the 
smooth, warm leaves, surprised by the enormous size of the fruits some of the 
plants had produced. 

“It’s too hot down here,” Casey complained. He pulled his T-shirt off over 
his head and dropped it onto the floor. 

“What a bod!” Diane teased him. 

He stuck out his tongue at her. Then his pale blue eyes grew wide and he 
seemed to freeze in surprise. “Hey!” 

“Casey—what’s the matter?” Margaret asked, hurrying over to him. 

“This one—” He pointed to a tall, treelike plant. “It’s breathing !” 

Diane laughed. 

But Margaret heard it, too. She grabbed Casey’s bare shoulder and listened. 
Yes. She could hear breathing sounds, and they seemed to be coming from the 
tall, leafy tree. 

“What’s your problem?” Diane asked, seeing the amazed expressions on 
Casey’s and Margaret’s faces. 

“Casey’s right,” Margaret said softly, listening to the steady, rhythmic 
sound. “You can hear it breathing.” 

Diane rolled her eyes. “Maybe it has a cold. Maybe its vine is stuffed up.” 
She laughed at her own joke, but her two companions didn’t join in. “I don’t 
hear it.” She moved closer. 

All three of them listened. 

Silence. 

“It—stopped,” Margaret said. 

“Stop it, you two,” Diane scolded. “You’re not going to scare me.” 

“No. Really,” Margaret protested. 

“Hey—look at this!” Casey had already moved on to something else. He 
was standing in front of a tall glass case that stood on the other side of the plants. 
It looked a little like a phone booth, with a shelf inside about shoulder-high, and 



dozens of wires attached to the back and sides. 

Margaret’s eyes followed the wires to a similar glass booth a few feet away. 
Some kind of electrical generator stood between the two booths and appeared to 
be connected to both of them. 

“What could that be?” Diane asked, hurrying over to Casey. 

“Don’t touch it,” Margaret warned, giving the breathing plant one final 
glance, then joining the others. 

But Casey reached out to the glass door on the front of the booth. “I just 
want to see if this opens,” he said. 

He grabbed the glass—and his eyes went wide with shock. 

His entire body began to shake and vibrate. His head jerked wildly from 
side to side. His eyes rolled up in his head. 

“Oh, help!” he managed to cry, his body vibrating and shaking harder and 
faster. “Help me! I—can’t stop!” 



4 


“Help me!” 

Casey’s whole body shook as if an electrical current were charging through 
him. His head jerked on his shoulders, and his eyes looked wild and dazed. 

“Please!” 

Margaret and Diane stared in open-mouthed horror. Margaret was the first 
to move. She lunged at Casey, and reached out to try to pull him away from the 
glass. 

“Margaret—don’t!” Diane screamed. “Don’t touch him!” 

“But we have to do something!” Margaret cried. 

It took both girls a while to realize that Casey had stopped shaking. And 
was laughing. 

“Casey?” Margaret asked, staring at him, her terrified expression fading to 
astonishment. 

He was leaning against the glass, his body still now, his mouth wrapped in a 
broad, mischievous grin. 

“Gotcha!” he declared. And then began to laugh even harder, pointing at 
them and repeating the phrase through his triumphant laughter. “Gotcha! 
Gotcha!” 

“That wasn’t funny!” Margaret screamed. 

“You were faking it?! I don’t believe it!” Diane cried, her face as pale as the 
white lights above them, her lower lip trembling. 

Both girls leapt onto Casey and pushed him to the floor. Margaret sat on top 
of him while Diane held his shoulders down. 

“Gotcha! Gotcha!” he continued, stopping only when Margaret tickled his 
stomach so hard he couldn’t talk. 

“You rat!” Diane cried. “You little rat!” 

The free-for-all was brought to a sudden halt by a low moan from across the 
room. All three kids raised their heads and stared in the direction of the sound. 

The large basement was silent now except for their heavy breathing. 

“What was that?” Diane whispered. 

They listened. 

Another low moan, a mournful sound, muffled, like air through a 



saxophone. 

The tendrils of a treelike plant suddenly drooped, like snakes lowering 
themselves to the ground. 

Another low, sad moan. 

“It’s—the plants!” Casey said, his expression frightened now. He pushed 
his sister off him and climbed to his feet, brushing back his disheveled blond hair 
as he stood up. 

“Plants don’t cry and moan,” Diane said, her eyes on the vast trough of 
plants that filled the room. 

“These do,” Margaret said. 

Tendrils moved, like human arms shifting their position. They could hear 
breathing again, slow, steady breathing. Then a sigh, like air escaping. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Casey said, edging toward the stairs. 

“It’s definitely creepy down here,” Diane said, following him, her eyes 
remaining on the shifting, moaning plants. 

“I’m sure Dad could explain it,” Margaret said. Her words were calm, but 
her voice trembled, and she was backing out of the room, following Diane and 
Casey. 

“Your dad is weird,” Diane said, reaching the doorway. 

“No, he isn’t,” Casey quickly insisted. “He’s doing important work here.” 

A tall treelike plant sighed and appeared to bend toward them, raising its 
tendrils as if beckoning to them, calling them back. 

“Let’s just get out of here!” Margaret exclaimed. 

All three of them were out of breath by the time they ran up the stairs. 
Casey closed the door tightly, making sure it clicked shut. 

“Weird,” Diane repeated, playing nervously with a strand of her long red 
hair. “Definitely weird.” It was her word of the day. But Margaret had to admit it 
was appropriate. 

“Well, Dad warned us not to go down there,” Margaret said, struggling to 
catch her breath. “I guess he knew it would look scary to us, and we wouldn’t 
understand.” 

“I’m getting out of here,” Diane said, only half-kidding. She stepped out of 
the screen door and turned back toward them. “Want to go over the math later?” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Margaret said, still thinking about the moaning, shifting 
plants. Some of them had seemed to be reaching out to them, crying out to them. 
But of course that was impossible. 



“Later,” Diane said, and headed at a trot down the drive. 

Just as she disappeared, their father’s dark blue station wagon turned the 
corner and started up the drive. “Back from the airport,” Margaret said. She 
turned from the door back to Casey a few yards behind her in the hallway. “Is the 
basement door closed?” 

“Yeah,” Casey replied, looking again to make sure. “No way Dad will know 
we—” 

He stopped. His mouth dropped open, but no sound came out. 

His face went pale. 

“My T-shirt!” Casey exclaimed, slapping his bare chest. “I left it in the 
basement!” 



5 


“I’ve got to get it,” Casey said. “Otherwise Dad’ll know—” 

“It’s too late,” Margaret interrupted, her eyes on the driveway. “He’s 
already pulled up the drive.” 

“It’ll only take a second,” Casey insisted, his hand on the basement 
doorknob. “I’ll run down and run right up.” 

“No!” Margaret stood tensely in the center of the narrow hallway, halfway 
between the front door and the basement door, her eyes toward the front. “He’s 
parked. He’s getting out of the car.” 

“But he’ll know! He’ll know!” Casey cried, his voice high and whiny. 

“So?” 

“Remember how mad he got last time?” Casey asked. 

“Of course I remember,” Margaret replied. “But he’s not going to kill us, 
Casey, just because we took a peek at his plants. He’s—” 

Margaret stopped. She moved closer to the screen door. “Hey, wait.” 

“What’s going on?” Casey asked. 

“Hurry!” Margaret turned and gestured with both hands. “Go! Get 
downstairs—fast! Mr. Henry from next door. He stopped Dad. They’re talking 
about something in the drive.” 

With a loud cry, Casey flung open the basement door and disappeared. 
Margaret heard him clumping rapidly down the stairs. Then she heard his 
footsteps fade as he hurried into their father’s workroom. 

Hurry, Casey, she thought, standing guard at the front door, watching her 
father shielding his eyes from the sun with one hand as he talked with Mr. 
Henry. 

Hurry. 

You know Dad never talks for long with the neighbors. 

Mr. Henry seemed to be doing all the talking. Probably asking Dad some 
kind of favor, Margaret thought. Mr. Henry wasn’t handy at all, not like Dr. 
Brewer. And so he was always asking Margaret’s dad to come over and help 
repair or install things. 

Her father was nodding now, a tight smile on his face. 

Hurry, Casey. 



Get back up here. Where are you? 

Still shielding his eyes, Dr. Brewer gave Mr. Henry a quick wave. Then 
both men spun around and began walking quickly toward their houses. 

Hurry, Casey. 

Casey—he’s coming! Hurry! Margaret urged silently. 

It doesn’t take this long to pick your T-shirt up from the floor and run up the 
stairs. 

It shouldn ’t take this long. 

Her dad was on the front walk now. He spotted her in the doorway and 
waved. 

Margaret returned the wave and looked back through the hallway to the 
basement door. “Casey—where are you?” she called aloud. 

No reply. 

No sound from the basement. 

No sound at all. 

Dr. Brewer had paused outside to inspect the rosebushes at the head of the 
front walk. 

“Casey?” Margaret called. 

Still no reply. 

“Casey—hurry!” 

Silence. 

Her father was crouching down, doing something to the soil beneath the 
rosebushes. 

With a feeling of dread weighing down her entire body, Margaret realized 
she had no choice. 

She had to go downstairs and see what was keeping Casey. 



6 


Casey ran down the steps, leaning on the metal banister so that he could jump 
down two steps at a time. He landed hard on the cement basement floor and 
darted into the bright white light of the plant room. 

Stopping at the entrance way, he waited for his eyes to adjust to the 
brighter-than-day light. He took a deep breath, inhaling the steamy air, and held 
it. It was so hot down here, so sticky. His back began to itch. The back of his 
neck tingled. 

The jungle of plants stood as if at attention under the bright white lights. 

He saw his T-shirt, lying crumpled on the floor a few feet from a tall, leafy 
tree. The tree seemed to lean toward the T-shirt, its long tendrils hanging down, 
loosely coiled on the soil around its trunk. 

Casey took a timid step into the room. 

Why am I so afraid? he wondered. 

It’s just a room filled with strange plants. 

Why do I have the feeling that they’re watching me? Waiting for me? 

He scolded himself for being so afraid and took a few more steps toward 
the crumpled T-shirt on the floor. 

Hey—wait. 

The breathing. 

There it was again. 

Steady breathing. Not too loud. Not too soft, either. 

Who could be breathing? What could be breathing? 

Was the big tree breathing? 

Casey stared at the shirt on the floor. So near. What was keeping him from 
grabbing it and running back upstairs? What was holding him back? 

He took a step forward. Then another. 

Was the breathing growing louder? 

He jumped, startled by a sudden, low moan from the big supply closet 
against the wall. 

It sounded so human, as if someone were in there, moaning in pain. 

“Casey—where are you?” 



Margaret’s voice sounded so far away, even though she was just at the head 
of the stairs. 

“Okay so far,” he called back to her. But his voice came out in a whisper. 
She probably couldn’t hear him. 

He took another step. Another. 

The shirt was about three yards away. 

A quick dash. A quick dive, and he’d have it. 

Another low moan from the supply closet. A plant seemed to sigh. A tall 
fern suddenly dipped low, shifting its leaves. 

“Casey?” He could hear his sister from upstairs, sounding very worried. 
“Casey—hurry!” 

I’m trying, he thought. I’m trying to hurry. 

What was holding him back? 

Another low moan, this time from the other side of the room. 

He took two more steps, then crouched low, his arms straight out in front of 

him. 

The shirt was almost within reach. 

He heard a groaning sound, then more breathing. 

He raised his eyes to the tall tree. The long, ropy tendrils had tensed. 
Stiffened. Or had he imagined it? 

No. 

They had been drooping loosely. Now they were taut. Ready. 

Ready to grab him? 

“Casey—hurry!” Margaret called, sounding even farther away. 

He didn’t answer. He was concentrating on the shirt. Just a few feet away. 
Just a few feet. Just a foot. 

The plant groaned again. 

“Casey? Casey?” 

The leaves quivered all the way up the trunk. 

Just a foot away. Almost in reach. 

“Casey? Are you okay? Answer me!” 

He grabbed the shirt. 

Two snakelike tendrils swung out at him. 

“Huh?” he cried out, paralyzed with fear. “What’s happening?” 

The tendrils wrapped themselves around his waist. 



“Let go!” he cried, holding the T-shirt tightly in one hand, grabbing at the 
tendrils with the other. 

The tendrils hung on, and gently tightened around him. 

Margaret? Casey tried calling, but no sound came out of his mouth. 
Margaret? 

He jerked violently, then pulled straight ahead. 

The tendrils held on. 

They didn’t squeeze him. They weren’t trying to strangle him. Or pull him 
back. 

But they didn’t let go. 

They felt warm and wet against his bare skin. Like animal arms. Not like a 
plant. 

Help! He again tried to shout. He pulled once more, leaning forward, using 
all his strength. 

No good. 

He ducked low, hit the floor, tried to roll away. 

The tendrils hung on. 

The plant uttered a loud sigh. 

“Let go!” Casey cried, finally finding his voice. 

And then suddenly Margaret was standing beside him. He hadn’t heard her 
come down the stairs. He hadn’t seen her enter the room. 

“Casey!” she cried. “What’s—” 

Her mouth dropped open and her eyes grew wide. 

“It—won’t let go!” he told her. 

“No!” she screamed. And grabbed one of the tendrils with both hands. And 
tugged with all her strength. 

The tendril resisted for only a moment, then went slack. 

Casey uttered a joyful cry and spun away from the remaining tendril. 
Margaret dropped the tendril and grabbed Casey’s hand and began running 
toward the stairs. 

“Oh!” 

They both stopped short at the bottom of the stairway. 

Standing at the top was their father, glaring down at them, his hands balled 
into tight fists at his sides, his face rigid with anger. 



7 


“Dad—the plants! ” Margaret cried. 

He stared down at them, his eyes cold and angry, unblinking. He was silent. 

“It grabbed Casey!” Margaret told him. 

“I just went down to get my shirt,” Casey said, his voice trembling. 

They stared up at him expectantly, waiting for him to move, to unball his 
fists, to relax his hard expression, to speak. But he glared down at them for the 
longest time. 

Finally, he said, “You’re okay?” 

“Yeah,” they said in unison, both of them nodding. 

Margaret realized she was still holding Casey’s hand. She let go of it and 
reached for the banister. 

“I’m very disappointed in you both,” Dr. Brewer said in a low, flat voice, 
cool but not angry. 

“Sorry,” Margaret said. “We knew we shouldn’t—” 

“We didn’t touch anything. Really!” Casey exclaimed. 

“Very disappointed,” their father repeated. 

“Sorry, Dad.” 

Dr. Brewer motioned for them to come upstairs, then he stepped into the 
hallway. 

“I thought he was going to yell at us,” Casey whispered to Margaret as he 
followed her up the steps. 

“That’s not Dad’s style,” Margaret whispered back. 

“He sure yelled at us the last time we started into the basement,” Casey 
replied. 

They followed their father into the kitchen. He motioned for them to sit 
down at the white Formica table, then dropped into a chair across from them. 

His eyes went from one to the other, as if studying them, as if seeing them 
for the first time. His expression was totally flat, almost robotlike, revealing no 
emotion at all. 

“Dad, what’s with those plants?” Casey asked. 

“What do you mean?” Dr. Brewer asked. 



“They’re—so weird,” Casey said. 

“I’ll explain them to you some day,” he said flatly, still staring at the two of 
them. 

“It looks very interesting,” Margaret said, struggling to say the right thing. 

Was their dad trying to make them feel uncomfortable? she wondered. If so, 
he was doing a good job of it. 

This wasn’t like him. Not at all. He was always a very direct person, 
Margaret thought. If he was angry, he said he was angry. If he was upset, he’d 
tell them he was upset. 

So why was he acting so strange, so silent, so... cold? 

“I asked you not to go in the basement,” he said quietly, crossing his legs 
and leaning back so that the kitchen chair tilted back on two legs. “I thought I 
made it clear.” 

Margaret and Casey glanced at each other. Finally, Margaret said, “We 
won’t do it again.” 

“But can’t you take us down there and tell us what you’re doing?” Casey 
asked. He still hadn’t put the T-shirt on. He was holding it in a ball between his 
hands on the kitchen table. 

“Yeah. We’d really like to understand it,” Margaret added enthusiastically. 

“Some day,” their father said. He returned the chair to all four legs and then 
stood up. “We’ll do it soon, okay?” He raised his arms above his head and 
stretched. “I’ve got to get back to work.” He disappeared into the front hallway. 

Casey raised his eyes to Margaret and shrugged. Their father reappeared 
carrying the lab coat he had tossed over the front banister. 

“Mom got off okay?” Margaret asked. 

He nodded. “I guess.” He pulled on the lab coat over his head. 

“I hope Aunt Eleanor is okay,” Margaret said. 

Dr. Brewer’s reply was muffled as he adjusted the lab coat and straightened 
the collar. “Later,” he said. He disappeared into the hallway. They heard him 
shut the basement door behind him. 

“I guess he’s not going to ground us or anything for going down there,” 
Margaret said, leaning against the table and resting her chin in her hands. 

“I guess,” Casey said. “He sure is acting... weird.” 

“Maybe he’s upset because Mom is gone,” Margaret said. She sat up and 
gave Casey a push. “Come on. Get up. I’ve got work to do.” 

“I can’t believe that plant grabbed me,” Casey said thoughtfully, not 



budging. 

“You don’t have to push,” Casey griped, but he climbed to his feet and 
stepped out of Margaret’s way. “I’m going to have bad dreams tonight,” he said 
glumly. 

“Just don’t think about the basement,” Margaret advised. That’s really lame 
advice, she told herself. But what else could she say? 

She went up to her room, thinking about how she missed her mother 
already. Then the scene in the basement with Casey trying to pull himself free of 
the enormous, twining plant tendrils played once again through her mind. 

With a shudder, she grabbed her textbook and threw herself onto her 
stomach on the bed, prepared to read. 

But the words on the page blurred as the moaning, breathing plants kept 
creeping back into her thoughts. 

At least we’re not being punished for going down there, she thought. 

At least Dad didn’t yell and frighten us this time. 

And at least Dad has promised to take us downstairs with him soon and 
explain to us what he’s working on down there. 

That thought made Margaret feel a lot better. 

She felt better until the next morning when she awoke early and went 
downstairs to make some breakfast. To her surprise, her father was already at 
work, the basement door was shut tight, and a lock had been installed on the 
door. 

The next Saturday afternoon, Margaret was up in her room, lying on top of the 
bed, talking to her mom on the phone. “I’m really sorry about Aunt Eleanor,” 
she said, twisting the white phone cord around her wrist. 

“The surgery didn’t go as well as expected,” her mother said, sounding very 
tired. “The doctors say she may have to have more surgery. But they have to 
build up her strength first.” 

“I guess this means you won’t be coming home real soon,” Margaret said 
sadly. 

Mrs. Brewer laughed. “Don’t tell me you actually miss me!” 

“Well... yes,” Margaret admitted. She raised her eyes to the bedroom 
window. Two sparrows had landed outside on the window ledge and were 
chattering excitedly, distracting Margaret, making it hard to hear her mother over 
the crackling line from Tucson. 



“How’s your father doing?” Mrs. Brewer asked. “I spoke to him last night, 
but he only grunted.” 

“He doesn’t even grunt to us!” Margaret complained. She held her hand 
over her ear to drown out the chattering birds. “He hardly says a word.” 

“He’s working really hard,” Mrs. Brewer replied. In the background, 
Margaret could hear some kind of loudspeaker announcement. Her mother was 
calling from a pay phone at the hospital. 

“He never comes out of the basement,” Margaret complained, a little more 
bitterly than she had intended. 

“Your father’s experiments are very important to him,” her mother said. 

“More important than we are?” Margaret cried. She hated the whiny tone in 
her voice. She wished she hadn’t started complaining about her dad over the 
phone. Her mother had enough to worry about at the hospital. Margaret knew 
she shouldn’t make her feel even worse. 

“Your dad has a lot to prove,” Mrs. Brewer said. “To himself, and to others. 
I think he’s working so hard because he wants to prove to Mr. Martinez and the 
others at the university that they were wrong to fire him. He wants to show them 
that they made a big mistake.” 

“But we used to see him more before he was home all the time! ” Margaret 
complained. 

She could hear her mother sigh impatiently. “Margaret, I’m trying to 
explain to you. You’re old enough to understand.” 

“I’m sorry,” Margaret said quickly. She decided to change the subject. 
“He’s wearing a baseball cap all of a sudden.” 

“Who? Casey?” 

“No, Mom,” Margaret replied. “Dad. He’s wearing a Dodgers cap. He never 
takes it off.” 

“Really?” Mrs. Brewer sounded very surprised. 

Margaret laughed. “We told him he looks really dorky in it, but he refuses 
to take it off.” 

Mrs. Brewer laughed, too. “Uh-oh. I’m being called,” she said. “Got to mn. 
Take care, dear. I’ll try to call back later.” 

A click, and she was gone. 

Margaret stared up at the ceiling, watching shadows from trees in the front 
yard move back and forth. The sparrows had flown away, leaving silence behind. 

Poor Mom, Margaret thought. 



She’s so worried about her sister, and I had to go and complain about Dad. 

Why did I do that? 

She sat up, listening to the silence. Casey was over at a friend’s. Her dad 
was no doubt working in the basement, the door carefully locked behind him. 

Maybe I’ll give Diane a call, Margaret thought. She reached for the phone, 
then realized she was hungry. Lunch first, she decided. Then Diane. 

She brushed her dark hair quickly, shaking her head at the mirror over her 
dressing table, then hurried downstairs. 

To her surprise, her dad was in the kitchen. He was huddled over the sink, 
his back to her. 

She started to call out to him, but stopped. What was he doing? 

Curious, she pressed against the wall, gazing at him through the doorway to 
the kitchen. 

Dr. Brewer appeared to be eating something. With one hand, he was 
holding a bag on the counter beside the sink. As Margaret watched in surprise, 
he dipped his hand into the bag, pulled out a big handful of something, and 
shoved it into his mouth. 

Margaret watched him chew hungrily, noisily, then pull out another handful 
from the bag and eat it greedily. 

What on earth is he eating? she wondered. He never eats with Casey and 
me. He always says he isn’t hungry. But he sure is hungry now! He acts as if he’s 
starving! 

She watched from the doorway as Dr. Brewer continued to grab handful 
after handful from the bag, gulping down his solitary meal. After a while, he 
crinkled up the bag and tossed it into the trash can under the sink. Then he wiped 
his hands off on the sides of his white lab coat. 

Margaret quickly backed away from the door, tiptoed through the hall and 
ducked into the living room. She held her breath as her father came into the hall, 
clearing his throat loudly. 

The basement door closed behind him. She heard him carefully lock it. 

When she was sure that he had gone downstairs, Margaret walked eagerly 
into the kitchen. She had to know what her father had been eating so greedily, so 
hungrily. 

She pulled open the sink cabinet, reached into the trash, and pulled out the 
crinkled-up bag. 

Then she gasped aloud as her eyes ran over the label. 



Her father, she saw, had been devouring plant food. 



8 


Margaret swallowed hard. Her mouth felt dry as cotton. She suddenly realized 
she was squeezing the side of the counter so tightly, her hand ached. 

Forcing herself to loosen her grip, she stared down at the half-empty plant 
food bag, which she had dropped onto the floor. 

She felt sick. She couldn’t get the disgusting picture out of her mind. How 
could her dad eat mud ? 

He didn’t just eat it, she realized. He shoveled it into his mouth and gulped 
it down. 

As if he liked it. 

As if he needed it. 

Eating the plant food had to be part of his experiments, Margaret told 
herself. But what kind of experiments? What was he trying to prove with those 
strange plants he was growing? 

The stuff inside the bag smelled sour, like fertilizer. Margaret took a deep 
breath and held it. She suddenly felt sick to her stomach. Staring at the bag, she 
couldn’t help but imagine what the disgusting muck inside must taste like. 

Ohh. 

She nearly gagged. 

How could her own father shove this horrid stuff into his mouth? 

Still holding her breath, she grabbed the nearly empty bag, wadded it up, 
and tossed it back into the trash. She started to turn away from the counter when 
a hand grabbed her shoulder. 

Margaret uttered a silent cry and spun around. “Casey!” 

“I’m home,” he said, grinning at her. “What’s for lunch?” 

Later, after making him a peanut butter sandwich, she told Casey what she had 
seen. 

Casey laughed. 

“It isn’t funny,” she said crossly. “Our own dad was eating dirt.” 

Casey laughed again. For some reason, it struck him funny. 

Margaret punched him hard on the shoulder, so hard that he dropped his 
sandwich. “Sorry,” she said quickly, “but I don’t see what you’re laughing at. It’s 



sick! There’s something wrong with Dad. Something really wrong.” 

“Maybe he just had a craving for plant food,” Casey cracked, still not 
taking her seriously. “You know. Like you get a craving for those honey-roasted 
peanuts.” 

“That’s different,” Margaret snapped. “Eating dirt is disgusting. Why won’t 
you admit it?” 

But before Casey could reply, Margaret continued, letting all of her 
unhappiness out at once. “Don’t you see? Dad has changed. A lot. Even since 
Mom has been gone. He spends even more time in the basement—” 

“That’s because Mom isn’t around,” Casey interrupted. 

“And he’s so quiet all the time and so cold to us,” Margaret continued, 
ignoring him. “He hardly says a word to us. He used to kid around all the time 
and ask us about our homework. He never says a human word. He never calls 
me Princess or Fatso the way he used to. He never—” 

“You hate those names, Fatso,” Casey said, giggling with a mouthful of 
peanut butter. 

“I know,” Margaret said impatiently. “That’s just an example.” 

“So what are you trying to say?” Casey asked. “That Dad is out of his tree? 
That he’s gone totally bananas?” 

“I—I don’t know,” Margaret answered in frustration. “Watching him gulp 
down that disgusting plant food, I—I had this horrible thought that he’s turning 
into a plant!” 

Casey jumped up, causing his chair to scrape back across the floor. He 
began staggering around the kitchen, zombielike, his eyes closed, his arms 
stretched out stiffly in front of him. “I am The Incredible Plant Man!” he 
declared, trying to make his voice sound bold and deep. 

“Not funny,” Margaret insisted, crossing her arms over her chest, refusing 
to be amused. 

“Plant Man versus Weed Woman!” Casey declared, staggering toward 
Margaret. 

“Not funny,” she repeated. 

He bumped into the counter, banging his knee. “Ow!” 

“Serves you right,” Margaret said. 

“Plant Man kills!” he cried, and rushed at her. He ran right into her, using 
his head as a battering ram against her shoulder. 

“Casey—will you stop it!” she screamed. “Give me a break!” 



“Okay, okay.” He backed off. “If you’ll do me one favor.” 

“What favor?” Margaret asked, rolling her eyes. 

“Make me another sandwich.” 

Monday afternoon after school, Margaret, Casey, and Diane were tossing a 
Frisbee back and forth in Diane’s backyard. It was a warm, breezy day, the sky 
dotted with small, puffy white clouds. 

Diane tossed the disc high. It sailed over Casey’s head into the row of 
fragrant lemon trees that stretched from behind the clapboard garage. Casey 
went running after it and tripped over an in-ground sprinkler that poked up just 
an inch above the lawn. 

Both girls laughed. 

Casey, on the run, flung the Frisbee toward Margaret. She reached for it, but 
the breeze sent it sailing from her hand. 

“What’s it like to have a mad scientist for a dad?” Diane asked suddenly. 

“What?” Margaret wasn’t sure she heard right. 

“Don’t just stand there. Throw it!” Casey urged from beside the garage. 

Margaret tossed the Frisbee high in the air in her brother’s general 
direction. He liked to run and make diving catches. 

“Just because he’s doing strange experiments doesn’t mean he’s a mad 
scientist,” Margaret said sharply. 

“Strange is right,” Diane said, her expression turning serious. “I had a 
nightmare last night about those gross plants in your basement. They were 
crying and reaching for me.” 

“Sorry,” Margaret said sincerely. “I’ve had nightmares, too.” 

“Look out!” Casey cried. He tossed a low one that Diane caught around her 
ankles. 

Mad scientist, Margaret thought. Mad scientist. Mad scientist. 

The words kept repeating in her mind. 

Mad scientists were only in the movies—right? 

“My dad was talking about your dad the other night,” Diane said, flipping 
the disc to Casey. 

“You didn’t tell him about—going down in the basement? Did you?” 
Margaret asked anxiously. 

“No,” Diane replied, shaking her head. 

“Hey, are these lemons ripe?” Casey asked, pointing at one of the low trees. 



“Why don’t you suck one to find out?” Margaret snapped, annoyed that he 
kept interrupting. 

“Why don’t you?” he predictably shot back. 

“My dad said that your dad was fired from PolyTech because his 
experiments got out of control, and he wouldn’t stop them,” Diane confided. She 
ran along the smooth, closely cropped grass, chasing down the Frisbee. 

“What do you mean?” Margaret asked. 

“The university told him he had to stop whatever it was he was doing, and 
he refused. He said he couldn’t stop. At least that’s what my dad heard from a 
guy who came into the salesroom.” 

Margaret hadn’t heard this story. It made her feel bad, but she thought it 
was probably true. 

“Something really bad happened in your dad’s lab,” Diane continued. 
“Someone got really hurt or killed or something.” 

“That’s not true,” Margaret insisted. “We would’ve heard if that happened.” 

“Yeah. Probably,” Diane admitted. “But my dad said your dad was fired 
because he refused to stop his experiments.” 

“Well, that doesn’t make him a mad scientist,” Margaret said defensively. 
She suddenly felt she had to stick up for her father. She wasn’t sure why. 

“I’m just telling you what I heard,” Diane said, brusquely tossing back her 
red hair. “You don’t have to bite my head off.” 

They played for a few more minutes. Diane changed the subject and talked 
about some kids they knew who were eleven but were going steady. Then they 
talked about school for a while. 

“Time to go,” Margaret called to Casey. He picked the Frisbee up from the 
lawn and came running over. “Call you later,” Margaret told Diane, giving her a 
little wave. Then she and Casey began to jog home, cutting through familiar 
backyards. 

“We need a lemon tree,” Casey said as they slowed to a walk. “They’re 
cool.” 

“Oh, yeah,” Margaret replied sarcastically. “That’s just what we need at our 
house. Another plant!” 

As they stepped through the hedges into their backyard, they were both 
surprised to see their dad. He was standing at the rose trellis examining clusters 
of pink roses. 

“Hey, Dad!” Casey called. “Catch!” He tossed the Frisbee to his father. 



Dr. Brewer turned around a little too slowly. The Frisbee glanced off his 
head, knocking the Dodgers cap off. His mouth opened wide in surprise. He 
raised his hands to cover his head. 

But it was too late. 

Margaret and Casey both shrieked in surprise as they saw his head. 

At first, Margaret thought her father’s hair had turned green. 

But then she clearly saw that it wasn’t hair on his scalp. 

His hair was gone. It had all fallen out. 

In place of hair, Dr. Brewer had bright green leaves sprouting from his 
head. 



9 


“Kids—it’s okay!” Dr. Brewer called. He bent down quickly, picked up the 
baseball cap, and replaced it on his head. 

A crow flew low overhead, cawing loudly. Margaret raised her eyes to 
follow the bird, but the sight of the hideous leaves sprouting from her father’s 
head wouldn’t go away. 

Her whole head began to itch as she imagined what it must feel like to have 
leaves uncurling from your scalp. 

“It’s okay. Really,” Dr. Brewer repeated, hurrying over to them. 

“But, Dad—your head,” Casey stammered. He suddenly looked very pale. 

Margaret felt sick. She kept swallowing hard, trying to ride out the waves of 
nausea. 

“Come here, you two,” their father said softly, putting an arm around each 
of their shoulders. “Let’s sit down in the shade over there and have a talk. I 
spoke to your mom on the phone this morning. She told me you’re upset about 
my work.” 

“Your head—it’s all green!” Casey repeated. 

“I know,” Dr. Brewer said, smiling. “That’s why I put on the cap. I didn’t 
want you two to worry.” 

He led them to the shade of the tall hedges that ran along the garage, and 
they sat down on the grass. “I guess you two think your dad has gotten pretty 
weird, huh?” 

He stared into Margaret’s eyes. Feeling uncomfortable, she looked away. 

Cawing frantically, the crow flew over again, heading in the other direction. 

“Margaret, you haven’t said a word,” her father said, squeezing her hand 
tenderly between his. “What’s wrong? What do you want to say to me?” 

Margaret sighed and still avoided her father’s glance. “Come on. Tell us. 
Why do you have leaves growing out of your head?” she asked bluntly. 

“It’s a side effect,” he told her, continuing to hold her hand. “It’s only 
temporary. It’ll go away soon and my hair will grow back.” 

“But how did it happen?” Casey asked, staring at his father’s Dodgers cap. 
A few green leaves poked out from under the brim. 

“Maybe you two would feel better if I explained what I’m trying to do 



down in the basement,” Dr. Brewer said, shifting his weight and leaning back on 
his hands. “I’ve been so wrapped up in my experiments, I haven’t had much time 
to talk to you.” 

“You haven’t had any time,” Margaret corrected him. 

“I’m sorry,” he said, lowering his eyes. “I really am. But this work I’m 
doing is so exciting and so difficult.” 

“Did you discover a new kind of plant?” Casey asked, crossing his legs 
beneath him. 

“No, I’m trying to build a new kind of plant,” Dr. Brewer explained. 

“Huh?” Casey exclaimed. 

“Have you ever talked about DNA in school?” their father asked. They 
shook their heads. “Well, it’s pretty complicated,” he continued. Dr. Brewer 
thought for a moment. “Let me try and put it in simple terms,” he said, fiddling 
with the bandage around his hand. “Let’s say we took a person who had a very 
high IQ. You know. Real brain power.” 

“Like me,” Casey interrupted. 

“Casey, shut up,” Margaret said edgily. 

“A real brain. Like Casey,” Dr. Brewer said agreeably. “And let’s say we 
were able to isolate the molecule or gene or tiny part of a gene that enabled the 
person to have such high intelligence. And then let’s say we were able to 
transmit it into other brains. And then this brain power could be passed along 
from generation to generation. And lots of people would have a high IQ. Do you 
understand?” He looked first at Casey, then at Margaret. 

“Yeah. Kind of,” Margaret said. “You take a good quality from one person 
and put it into other people. And then they have the good quality, too, and they 
pass it on to their children, and on and on.” 

“Very good,” Dr. Brewer said, smiling for the first time in weeks. “That’s 
what a lot of botanists do with plants. They try to take the fruit-bearing building 
block from one plant and put it into another. Create a new plant that will bear 
five times as much fruit, or five times as much grain, or vegetables.” 

“And that’s what you’re doing?” Casey asked. 

“Not exactly,” their father said, lowering his voice. “I’m doing something a 
little more unusual. I really don’t want to go into detail now. But I’ll tell you that 
what I’m trying to do is build a kind of plant that has never existed and could 
never exist. I’m trying to build a plant that’s part animal .” 

Casey and Margaret stared at their father in surprise. Margaret was the first 



to speak. “You mean you’re taking cells from an animal and putting them into a 
plant?” 

He nodded. “I really don’t want to say more. You two understand why this 
must be kept secret.” He turned his eyes on Margaret, then Casey, studying their 
reactions. 

“How do you do it?” Margaret asked, thinking hard about everything he had 
just told them. “How do you get these cells from the animals to the plant?” 

“I’m trying to do it by breaking them down electronically,” he answered. “I 
have two glass booths connected by a powerful electron generator. You may 
have seen them when you were snooping around down there.” He made a sour 
face. 

“Yeah. They look like phone booths,” Casey said. 

“One booth is a sender, and one is a receiver,” he explained. “I’m trying to 
send the right DNA, the right building blocks, from one booth to the other. It’s 
very delicate work.” 

“And have you done it?” Margaret asked. 

“I’ve come very close,” Dr. Brewer said, a pleased smile crossing his face. 
The smile lasted only a few seconds. Then, his expression thoughtful, he 
abruptly climbed to his feet. “Got to get back to work,” he said quietly. “See you 
two later.” He started walking across the lawn, taking long strides. 

“But, Dad,” Margaret called after him. She and Casey climbed to their feet, 
too. “Your head. The leaves. You didn’t explain it,” she said as she and her 
brother hurried to catch up to him. 

Dr. Brewer shrugged. “Nothing to explain,” he said curtly. “Just a side 
effect.” He adjusted his Dodgers cap. “Don’t worry about it. It’s only temporary. 
Just a side effect.” 

Then he hurried into the house. 

Casey seemed really pleased by their dad’s explanation of what was going on in 
the basement. “Dad’s doing really important work,” he said, with unusual 
seriousness. 

But, as Margaret made her way into the house, she found herself troubled 
by what her dad had said. And even more troubled by what he hadn’t said. 

Margaret closed the door to her room and lay down on the bed to think 
about things. Her father hadn’t really explained the leaves growing on his head. 
“Just a side effect” didn’t explain much at all. 



A side effect from what? What actually caused it? What made his hair fall 
out? When will his hair grow back? 

It was obvious that he hadn’t wanted to discuss it with them. He had 
certainly hurried back to his basement after telling them it was just a side effect. 

A side effect. 

It made Margaret feel sick every time she thought about it. 

What must it feel like? Green leaves pushing up from your pores, uncurling 
against your head. 

Yuck. Thinking about it made her itch all over. She knew she’d have 
hideous dreams tonight. 

She grabbed her pillow and hugged it over her stomach, wrapping her arms 
tightly around it. 

There were lots of other questions Casey and I should have asked, she 
decided. Like, why were the plants moaning down there? Why did some of them 
sound like they were breathing? Why did that plant grab Casey? What animal 
was Dad using? 

Lots of questions. 

Not to mention the one Margaret wanted to ask most of all: Why were you 
gulping down that disgusting plant food? 

But she couldn’t ask that one. She couldn’t let her dad know she’d been 
spying on him. 

She and Casey hadn’t really asked any of the questions they’d wanted 
answered. They were just so pleased that their father had decided to sit down and 
talk with them, even for a few minutes. 

His explanation was really interesting, as far as it went, Margaret decided. 
And it was good to know that he was close to doing something truly amazing, 
something that would make him really famous. 

But what about the rest of it? 

A frightening thought entered her mind: Could he have been lying to them? 

No, she quickly decided. No. Dad wouldn’t lie to us. 

There are just some questions he hasn’t answered yet. 

She was still thinking about all of these questions late that night—after 
dinner, after talking to Diane on the phone for an hour, after homework, after 
watching a little TV, after going to bed. And she was still puzzling over them. 

When she heard her father’s soft footsteps coming up the carpeted stairs, 
she sat up in bed. A soft breeze fluttered the curtains across the room. She 



listened to her father’s footsteps pass her room, heard him go into the bathroom, 
heard the water begin to run into the sink. 

I’ve got to ask him, she decided. 

Glancing at the clock, she saw that it was two-thirty in the morning. 

But she realized she was wide awake. 

I’ve got to ask him about the plant food. 

Otherwise, it will drive me crazy. I’ll think about it and think about it and 
think about it. Every time I see him, I’ll picture him standing over the sink, 
shoving handful after handful into his mouth. 

There’s got to be a simple explanation, she told herself, climbing out of bed. 
There’s got to be a logical explanation. 

And I have to know it. 

She padded softly down the hall, a sliver of light escaping through the 
bathroom door, which was slightly ajar. Water still ran into the sink. 

She heard him cough, then heard him adjust the water. 

I have to know the answer, she thought. 

I’ll just ask him point-blank. 

She stepped into the narrow triangle of light and peered into the bathroom. 

He was standing at the sink, leaning over it, his chest bare, his shirt tossed 
behind him on the floor. He had put the baseball cap on the closed toilet lid, and 
the leaves covering his head shone brightly under the bathroom light. 

Margaret held her breath. 

The leaves were so geeen, so thick. 

He didn’t notice her. He was concentrating on the bandage on his hand. 
Using a small scissors, he cut the bandage, then pulled it off. 

The hand was still bleeding, Margaret saw. 

Or was it? 

What was that dripping from the cut on her father’s hand? 

Still holding her breath, she watched him wash it off carefully under the hot 
water. Then he examined it, his eyes narrowed in concentration. 

After washing, the cut continued to bleed. 

Margaret stared hard, trying to better focus her eyes. 

It couldn’t be blood—could it? 

It couldn’t be blood dripping into the sink. 

It was bright green! 

She gasped and started to run back to her room. The floor creaked under her 



footsteps. 

“Who’s there?” Dr. Brewer cried. “Margaret? Casey?” 

He poked his head into the hallway as Margaret disappeared back into her 
room. 

He saw me, she realized, leaping into bed. 

He saw me—and now he’s coming after me. 



10 


Margaret pulled the covers up to her chin. She realized she was trembling, her 
whole body shaking and chilled. 

She held her breath and listened. 

She could still hear water splashing into the bathroom sink. 

But no footsteps. 

He isn’t coming after me, she told herself, letting out a long, silent sigh. 

How could I have thought that? How could I have been so terrified—of my 
own father? 

Terrified. 

It was the first time the word had crossed her mind. 

But sitting there in bed, trembling so violently, holding onto the covers so 
hard, listening for his approaching footsteps, Margaret realized that she was 
terrified. 

Of her own father. 

If only Mom were home, she thought. 

Without thinking, she reached for the phone. She had the idea in her head to 
call her mother, wake her up, tell her to come home as fast as she could. Tell her 
something terrible was happening to Dad. That he was changing. That he was 
acting so weird.... 

She glanced at the clock. Two-forty-three. 

No. She couldn’t do that. Her poor mother was having such a terrible time 
in Tucson trying to care for her sister. Margaret couldn’t frighten her like that. 

Besides, what could she say? How could she explain to her mother how she 
had become terrified of her own father? 

Mrs. Brewer would just tell her to calm down. That her father still loved 
her. That he would never harm her. That he was just caught up in his work. 

Caught up.... 

He had leaves growing out of his head, he was eating dirt, and his blood 
was green. 

Caught up.... 

She heard the water in the sink shut off. She heard the bathroom light being 
clicked off. Then she heard her father pad slowly to his room at the end of the 



hall. 


Margaret relaxed a little, slid down in the bed, loosened her grip on the 
blankets. She closed her eyes and tried to clear her mind. 

She tried counting sheep. 

That never worked. She tried counting to one thousand. At 375, she sat up. 
Her head throbbed. Her mouth was as dry as cotton. 

She decided to go downstairs and get a drink of cold water from the 
refrigerator. 

I’m going to be a wreck tomorrow, she thought, making her way silently 
through the hall and down the stairs. 

It is tomorrow. 

What am I going to do? I’ve got to get to sleep. 

The kitchen floor creaked beneath her bare feet. The refrigerator motor 
clicked on noisily, startling her. 

Be cool, she told herself. You’ve got to be cool. 

She had opened the refrigerator and was reaching for the water bottle when 
a hand grabbed her shoulder. 

“Aii!” She cried out and dropped the open bottle onto the floor. Ice-cold 
water puddled around her feet. She leapt back, but her feet were soaked. 

“Casey—you scared me!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing up?” 

“What are you doing up?” he replied, half asleep, his blond hair matted 
against his forehead. 

“I couldn’t sleep. Help me mop up this water.” 

“I didn’t spill it,” he said, backing away. “You mop it up.” 

“You made me spill it!” Margaret declared shrilly. She grabbed a roll of 
paper towels off the counter and handed him a wad of them. “Come on. Hurry.” 

They both got down on their knees and, by the light from the refrigerator, 
began mopping up the cold water. 

“I just keep thinking about things,” Casey said, tossing a soaking wad of 
paper towel onto the counter. “That’s why I can’t sleep.” 

“Me, too,” Margaret said, frowning. 

She started to say something else, but a sound from the hallway stopped 
her. It was a plaintive cry, a moan filled with sadness. 

Margaret gasped and stopped dabbing at the water. “What was that?” 

Casey’s eyes filled with fear. 

They heard it again, such a sad sound, like a plea, a mournful plea. 



“It—it’s coming from the basement,” Margaret said. 

“Do you think it’s a plant?” Casey asked very quietly. “Do you think it’s 
one of Dad’s plants?” 

Margaret didn’t answer. She crouched on her knees, not moving, just 
listening. 

Another moan, softer this time but just as mournful. 

“I don’t think Dad told us the truth,” she told Casey, staring into his eyes. 
He looked pale and frightened in the dim refrigerator light. “I don’t think a 
tomato plant would make a sound like that.” 

Margaret climbed to her feet, collected the wet clumps of paper towel, and 
deposited them in the trash can under the sink. Then she closed the refrigerator 
door, covering the room in darkness. 

Her hand on Casey’s shoulder, she guided him out of the kitchen and 
through the hall. They stopped at the basement door, and listened. 

Silence now. 

Casey tried the door. It was locked. 

Another low moan, sounding very nearby now. 

“It’s so human,” Casey whispered. 

Margaret shuddered. What was going on down in the basement? What was 
really going on? 

She led the way up the stairs and waited at her doorway until Casey was 
safely in his room. He gave her a wave, yawning silently, and closed the door 
behind him. 

A few seconds later, Margaret was back in her bed, the covers pulled up to 
her chin despite the warmth of the night. Her mouth was still achingly dry, she 
realized. She had never managed to get a drink. 

Somehow she drifted into a restless sleep. 

Her alarm went off at seven-thirty. She sat up and thought about school. 
Then she remembered there was no school for the next two days because of 
some kind of teachers’ conference. 

She turned off the clock radio, slumped back onto her pillow, and tried to 
go back to sleep. But she was awake now, thoughts of the night before pouring 
back into her mind, flooding her with the fear she had felt just a few hours 
earlier. 

She stood up and stretched, and decided to go talk to her father, to confront 
him first thing, to ask all the questions she wanted to ask. 



If I don’t, he’ll disappear down to the basement, and I’ll sit around thinking 
these frightening thoughts all day, she told herself. 

I don’t want to be terrified of my own father. 

I don’t. 

She pulled a light cotton robe over her pajamas, found her slippers in the 
cluttered closet, and stepped out into the hallway. It was hot and stuffy in the 
hall, almost suffocating. Pale, morning light filtered down from the skylight 
overhead. 

She stopped in front of Casey’s room, wondering if she should wake him so 
that he could ask their father questions, too. 

No, she decided. The poor guy was up half the night. I’ll let him sleep. 

Taking a deep breath, she walked the rest of the hall and stopped at her 
parents’ bedroom. The door was open. 

“Dad?” 

No reply. 

“Dad? Are you up?” 

She stepped into the room. “Dad?” 

He didn’t seem to be there. 

The air in here was heavy and smelled strangely sour. The curtains were 
drawn. The bedclothes were rumpled and tossed down at the foot of the bed. 
Margaret took a few more steps toward the bed. 

“Dad?” 

No. She had missed him. He was probably already locked in his basement 
workroom, she realized unhappily. 

He must have gotten up very early and— 

What was that in the bed? 

Margaret clicked on a dresser lamp and stepped up beside the bed. 

“Oh, no!” she cried, raising her hands to her face in horror. 

The bedsheet was covered with a thick layer of dirt. Clumps of dirt. 

Margaret stared down at it, not breathing, not moving. 

The dirt was black and appeared to be moist. 

And the dirt was moving. 

Moving? 

It can’t be, Margaret thought. That’s impossible. 

She leaned down to take a closer look at the layer of dirt. 

No. The dirt wasn’t moving. 



The dirt was filled with dozens of moving insects. And long, brown 
earthworms. All crawling through the wet, black clumps that lined her father’s 


bed. 



11 


Casey didn’t come downstairs until ten-thirty. Before his arrival, Margaret had 
made herself breakfast, managed to pull on jeans and a T-shirt, had talked to 
Diane on the phone for half an hour, and had spent the rest of the time pacing 
back and forth in the living room, trying to decide what to do. 

Desperate to talk to her dad, she had banged a few times on the basement 
door, timidly at first and then loudly. But he either couldn’t hear her or chose not 
to. He didn’t respond. 

When Casey finally emerged, she poured him a tall glass of orange juice 
and led him out to the backyard to talk. It was a hazy day, the sky mostly yellow, 
the air already stifling hot even though the sun was still hovering low over the 
hills. 

Walking toward the block of green shade cast by the hedges, she told her 
brother about their dad’s green blood and about the insect-filled dirt in his bed. 

Casey stood open-mouthed, holding the glass of orange juice in front of 
him, untouched. He stared at Margaret, and didn’t say anything for a very long 
time. 

Finally, he set the orange juice down on the lawn and said, “What should 
we do?” in a voice just above a whisper. 

Margaret shrugged. “I wish Mom would call.” 

“Would you tell her everything?” Casey asked, shoving his hands deep into 
the pockets of his baggy shorts. 

“I guess,” Margaret said. “I don’t know if she’d believe it, but—” 

“It’s so scary,” Casey said. “I mean, he’s our dad. We’ve known him our 
whole lives. I mean—” 

“I know,” Margaret said. “But he’s not the same. He’s—” 

“Maybe he can explain it all,” Casey said thoughtfully. “Maybe there’s a 
good reason for everything. You know. Like the leaves on his head.” 

“We asked him about that,” Margaret reminded her brother. “He just said it 
was a side effect. Not much of an explanation.” 

Casey nodded, but didn’t reply. 

“I told some of it to Diane,” Margaret admitted. 

Casey looked up at her in surprise. 



“Well, I had to tell somebody,” she snapped edgily. “Diane thought I should 
call the police.” 

“Huh?” Casey shook his head. “Dad hasn’t done anything wrong—has he? 
What would the police do?” 

“I know,” Margaret replied. “That’s what I told Diane. But she said there’s 
got to be some kind of law against being a mad scientist.” 

“Dad isn’t a mad scientist,” Casey said angrily. “That’s stupid. He’s just— 
He’s just—” 

Just what? Margaret thought. What is he? 

A few hours later, they were still in the backyard, trying to figure out what 
to do, when the kitchen door opened and their father called them to come in. 

Margaret looked at Casey in surprise. “I don’t believe it. He came upstairs.” 

“Maybe we can talk to him,” Casey said. 

They both raced into the kitchen. Dr. Brewer, his Dodgers cap in place, 
flashed them a smile as he set two soup bowls down on the table. “Hi,” he said 
brightly. “Lunchtime.” 

“Huh? You made lunch?” Casey exclaimed, unable to conceal his 
astonishment. 

“Dad, we’ve got to talk,” Margaret said seriously. 

“Afraid I don’t have much time,” he said, avoiding her stare. “Sit down. Try 
this new dish. I want to see if you like it.” 

Margaret and Casey obediently took their places at the table. “What is this 
stuff?” Casey cried. 

The two bowls were filled with a green, pulpy substance. “It looks like 
green mashed potatoes,” Casey said, making a face. 

“It’s something different,” Dr. Brewer said mysteriously, standing over 
them at the head of the table. “Go ahead. Taste it. I’ll bet you’ll be surprised.” 

“Dad—you’ve never made lunch for us before,” Margaret said, trying to 
keep the suspicion out of her voice. 

“I just wanted you to try this,” he said, his smile fading. “You’re my guinea 
pigs.” 

“We have some things we want to ask you,” Margaret said, lifting her 
spoon, but not eating the green mess. 

“Your mother called this morning,” their father said. 

“When?” Margaret asked eagerly. 

“Just a short while ago. I guess you were outside and didn’t hear the phone 



ring.” 

“What did she say?” Casey asked, staring down at the bowl in front of him. 

“Aunt Eleanor’s doing better. She’s been moved out of intensive care. Your 
mom may be able to come home soon.” 

“Great!” Margaret and Casey cried in unison. 

“Eat,” Dr. Brewer instructed, pointing to the bowls. 

“Uh... aren’t you going to have some?” Casey asked, rolling his spoon 
around in his fingers. 

“No,” their father replied quickly. “I already ate.” He leaned with both 
hands against the tabletop. Margaret saw that his cut hand was freshly bandaged. 

“Dad, last night—” she started. 

But he cut her off. “Eat, will you? Try it.” 

“But what is it?” Casey demanded, whining. “It doesn’t smell too good.” 

“I think you’ll like the taste,” Dr. Brewer insisted impatiently. “It should 
taste very sweet.” 

He stared at them, urging them to eat the green stuff. 

Staring into the bowl at the mysterious substance, Margaret was suddenly 
frozen with fear. He’s too eager for us to eat this, she thought, glancing up at her 
brother. 

He’s too desperate. 

He’s never made lunch before. Why did he make this? 

And why won’t he tell us what it is? 

What’s going on here? she wondered. And Casey’s expression revealed that 
he was wondering the same thing. 

Is Dad trying to do something to us? Is this green stuff going to change us, 
or hurt us... or make us grow leaves, too? 

What crazy thoughts, Margaret realized. 

But she also realized that she was terrified of whatever this stuff was he was 
trying to feed them. 

“What’s the matter with you two?” their father cried impatiently. He raised 
his hand in an eating gesture. “Pick up your spoons. Come on. What are you 
waiting for?” 

Margaret and Casey raised their spoons and dropped them into the soft, 
green substance. But they didn’t raise the spoons to their mouths. 

They couldn’t. 

“Eat! Eat!” Dr. Brewer screamed, pounding the table with his good hand. 



“What are you waiting for? Eat your lunch. Go ahead. Eat it!” 

He’s giving us no choice, Margaret thought. 

Her hand was trembling as she reluctantly raised the spoon to her mouth. 



12 


“Go ahead. You’ll like it,” Dr. Brewer insisted, leaning over the table. 

Casey watched as Margaret raised the spoon to her lips. 

The doorbell rang. 

“Who could that be?” Dr. Brewer asked, very annoyed at the interruption. 
“I’ll be right back, kids.” He lumbered out to the front hall. 

“Saved by the bell,” Margaret said, dropping the spoon back into the bowl 
with a sickening plop. 

“This stuff is disgusting,” Casey whispered. “It’s some kind of plant food or 
something. Yuck!” 

“Quick—” Margaret said, jumping up and grabbing the two bowls. “Help 

me.” 

They rushed to the sink, pulled out the waste-basket, and scooped the 
contents of both bowls into the garbage. Then they carried both bowls back to 
the table and set them down beside the spoons. 

“Let’s go see who’s at the door,” Casey said. 

They crept into the hall in time to see a man carrying a black briefcase step 
into the front entranceway and greet their father with a short handshake. The 
man had a tanned bald head and was wearing large, blue-lensed sunglasses. He 
had a brown mustache and was wearing a navy blue suit with a red-and-white 
striped tie. 

“Mr. Martinez!” their father exclaimed. “What a... surprise.” 

“That’s Dad’s old boss from PolyTech,” Margaret whispered to Casey. 

“I know,” Casey replied peevishly. 

“I said weeks ago I’d come check up on how your work is coming along,” 
Martinez said, sniffing the air for some reason. “Wellington gave me a lift. My 
car is in the garage—for a change.” 

“Well, I’m not really ready,” Dr. Brewer stammered, looking very 
uncomfortable even from Margaret’s vantage point behind him. “I wasn’t 
expecting anyone. I mean... I don’t think this is a good time.” 

“No problem. I’ll just have a quick look,” Martinez said, putting a hand on 
Dr. Brewer’s shoulder as if to calm him. “I’ve always been so interested in your 
work. You know that. And you know that it wasn’t my idea to let you go. The 



board forced me. They gave me no choice. But I’m not giving up on you. I 
promise you that. Come on. Let’s see what kind of progress you’re making.” 

“Well...” Dr. Brewer couldn’t hide his displeasure at Mr. Martinez’s 
surprise appearance. He scowled and tried to block the path to the basement 
steps. 

At least, it seemed that way to Margaret, who watched silently beside her 
brother. 

Mr. Martinez stepped past Dr. Brewer and pulled open the basement door. 
“Hi, guys.” Mr. Martinez gave the two kids a wave, hoisting his briefcase as if it 
weighed two tons. 

Their father looked surprised to see them there. “Did you kids finish your 
lunch?” 

“Yeah, it was pretty good,” Casey lied. 

The answer seemed to please Dr. Brewer. Adjusting the brim of his Dodgers 
cap, he followed Mr. Martinez into the basement, carefully closing and locking 
the door behind him. 

“Maybe he’ll give Dad his job back,” Casey said, walking back into the 
kitchen. He pulled open the refrigerator to look for something for lunch. 

“Don’t be stupid,” Margaret said, reaching over him to pull out a container 
of egg salad. “If Dad really is growing plants that are part animal, he’ll be 
famous. He won’t need a job.” 

“Yeah, I guess,” Casey said thoughtfully. “Is that all there is? Just egg 
salad?” 

“I’ll make you a sandwich,” Margaret offered. 

“I’m not really hungry,” Casey replied. “That green stuff made me sick. 
Why do you think he wanted us to eat it?” 

“I don’t know,” Margaret said. She put a hand on Casey’s slender shoulder. 
“I’m really scared, Casey. I wish Mom were home.” 

“Me, too,” he said quietly. 

Margaret put the egg salad back into the refrigerator. She closed the door, 
then leaned her hot forehead against it. “Casey—” 

“What?” 

“Do you think Dad is telling us the truth?” 

“About what?” 

“About anything?” 

“I don’t know,” Casey said, shaking his head. Then his expression suddenly 



changed. “There’s one way to find out,” he said, his eyes lighting up. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” Margaret pushed herself away from the 
refrigerator. 

“The first chance we get, the first time Dad is away,” Casey whispered, 
“let’s go back down in the basement and see for ourselves what Dad is doing.” 



13 


They got their chance the next afternoon when their father emerged from the 
basement, red metal toolchest in hand. “I promised Mr. Henry next door I’d help 
him install a new sink in his bathroom,” he explained, adjusting his Dodgers cap 
with his free hand. 

“When are you coming back?” Casey asked, glancing at Margaret. 

Not very subtle, Casey, Margaret thought, rolling her eyes. 

“It shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours,” Dr. Brewer said. He 
disappeared out the kitchen door. 

They watched him cut through the hedges in the backyard and head to Mr. 
Henry’s back door. “It’s now or never,” Margaret said, glancing doubtfully at 
Casey. “Think we can do this?” She tried the door. Locked, as usual. 

“No problem,” Casey said, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. 
“Go get a paper clip. I’ll show you what my friend Kevin taught me last week.” 

Margaret obediently found a paper clip on her desk and brought it to him. 
Casey straightened the clip out, then poked it into the lock. In a few seconds, he 
hummed a triumphant fanfare and pulled the door open. 

“Now you’re an expert lock picker, huh? Your friend Kevin is a good guy to 
know,” Margaret said, shaking her head. 

Casey grinned and motioned for Margaret to go first. 

“Okay. Let’s not think about it. Let’s just do it,” Margaret said, summoning 
her courage and stepping onto the landing. 

A few seconds later, they were in the basement. 

Knowing a little of what to expect down here didn’t make it any less 
frightening. They were hit immediately by a blast of steamy, hot air. The air, 
Margaret realized, was so wet, so thick, that droplets immediately clung to her 
skin. 

Squinting against the sudden bright light, they stopped in the doorway to 
the plant room. The plants seemed taller, thicker, more plentiful than the first 
time they had ventured down here. 

Long, sinewy tendrils drooped from thick yellow stalks. Broad green and 
yellow leaves bobbed and trembled, shimmering under the white light. Leaves 
slapped against each other, making a soft, wet sound. A fat tomato plopped to the 



ground. 

Everything seemed to shimmer. The plants all seemed to quiver expectantly. 
They weren’t standing still. They seemed to be reaching up, reaching out, 
quaking with energy as they grew. 

Long brown tendrils snaked along the dirt, wrapping themselves around 
other plants, around each other. A bushy fern had grown to the ceiling, curved, 
and started its way back down again. 

“Wow!” Casey cried, impressed with this trembling, glistening jungle. “Are 
all these plants really brand-new?” 

“I guess so,” Margaret said softly. “They look prehistoric!” 

They heard breathing sounds, loud sighing, a low moan coming from the 
direction of the supply closet against the wall. 

A tendril suddenly swung out from a long stalk. Margaret pulled Casey 
back. “Look out. Don’t get too close,” she warned. 

“I know,” he said sharply, moving away from her. “Don’t grab me like that. 
You scared me.” 

The tendril slid harmlessly to the dirt. 

“Sorry,” she said, squeezing his shoulder affectionately. “It’s just... well, 
you remember last time.” 

“I’ll be careful,” he said. 

Margaret shuddered. 

She heard breathing. Steady, quiet breathing. 

These plants are definitely not normal, she thought. She took a step back, 
letting her eyes roam over the amazing jungle of slithering, sighing plants. 

She was still staring at them when she heard Casey’s terrified scream. 

“Help! It’s got me! It’s got me!” 



14 


Margaret uttered a shriek of terror and spun away from the plants to find her 
brother. 

“Help!” Casey cried. 

Gripped with fear, Margaret took a few steps toward Casey, then saw the 
small, gray creature scampering across the floor. 

She started to laugh. 

“Casey, it’s a squirrel!” 

“What?” His voice was several octaves higher than normal. “It—it grabbed 
my ankle and—” 

“Look,” Margaret said, pointing. “It’s a squirrel. Look how scared it is. It 
must have run right into you.” 

“Oh.” Casey sighed. The color began to return to his ash-gray face. “I 
thought it was a... plant.” 

“Right. A furry gray plant,” Margaret said, shaking her head. Her heart was 
still thudding in her chest. “You sure gave me a scare, Casey.” 

The squirrel stopped several yards away, turned, stood up on its hind legs, 
and stared back at them, quivering all over. 

“How did a squirrel get down here?” Casey demanded, his voice still shaky. 

Margaret shrugged. “Squirrels are always getting in,” she said. “And 
remember that chipmunk we couldn’t get rid of?” Then she glanced over to the 
small ground-level window at the top of the opposite wall. “That window—it’s 
open,” she told Casey. “The squirrel must have climbed in over there.” 

“Shoo!” Casey yelled at the squirrel. He started to chase it. The squirrel’s 
tail shot right up in the air, and then it took off, running through the tangled 
plants. “Get out! Get out!” Casey screamed. 

The terrified squirrel, with Casey in close pursuit, circled the plants twice. 
Then it headed to the far wall, leapt onto a carton, then onto a higher carton, then 
bounded out the open window. 

Casey stopped running and stared up at the window. 

“Good work,” Margaret said. “Now, let’s get out of here. We don’t know 
what anything is. We have no idea what to look for. So we can’t tell if Dad is 
telling the truth or not.” 



She started toward the stairs, but stopped when she heard the bumping 
sound. “Casey—did you hear that?” She searched for her brother, but he was 
hidden by the thick leaves of the plants. “Casey?” 

“Yeah. I heard it,” he answered, still out of her view. “It’s coming from the 
supply closet.” 

The loud thumping made Margaret shudder. It sounded to her exactly like 
someone banging on the closet wall. 

“Casey, let’s check it out,” she said. 

No reply. 

The banging got louder. 

“Casey?” 

Why wasn’t he answering her? 

“Casey—where are you? You’re frightening me,” Margaret called, moving 
closer to the shimmering plants. Another tomato plopped to the ground, so near 
her foot, it made her jump. 

Despite the intense heat, she suddenly felt cold all over. 

“Casey?” 

“Margaret—come here. I’ve found something,” he finally said. He sounded 
uncertain, worried. 

She hurried around the plants and saw him standing in front of the 
worktable beside the supply closet. The banging from the closet had stopped. 

“Casey, what’s the matter? You scared me,” Margaret scolded. She stopped 
and leaned against the wooden worktable. 

“Look,” her brother said, holding up a dark, folded-up bundle. “I found this. 
On the floor. Shoved under this worktable.” 

“Huh? What is it?” Margaret asked. 

Casey unfolded it. It was a suit jacket. A blue suit jacket. A red-striped 
necktie was folded inside it. 

“It’s Mr. Martinez’s,” Casey said, squeezing the collar of the wrinkled 
jacket between his hands. “It’s his jacket and tie.” 

Margaret’s mouth dropped open into a wide O of surprise. “You mean he 
left it here?” 

“If he left it, why was it bundled up and shoved back under the table?” 
Casey asked. 

Margaret stared at the jacket. She ran her hand over the silky striped tie. 

“Did you see Mr. Martinez leave the house yesterday afternoon?” Casey 



asked. 

“No,” Margaret answered. “But he must have left. I mean, his car was 
gone.” 

“He didn’t drive, remember? He told Dad he got a lift.” 

Margaret raised her eyes from the wrinkled jacket to her brother’s worried 
face. “Casey—what are you saying? That Mr. Martinez didn’t leave? That he 
was eaten by a plant or something? That’s ridiculous!” 

“Then why were his coat and tie hidden like that?” Casey demanded. 

Margaret didn’t have a chance to respond. 

They both gasped as they heard loud footsteps on the stairs. 

Someone was hurrying down to the basement. 

“Hide!” Margaret whispered. 

“Where?” Casey asked, his eyes wide with panic. 



15 


Margaret leapt up onto the carton, then pulled herself through the small, open 
window. A tight squeeze, but she struggled out onto the grass. Then she turned 
around to help Casey. 

That squirrel turned out to be a friend, she thought, tugging her brother’s 
arms as he scrambled out of the basement. It showed us the only escape route. 

The afternoon air felt quite cool compared to the steamy basement. 
Breathing hard, they both squatted down to peer into the window. “Who is it?” 
Casey whispered. 

Margaret didn’t have to answer. They both saw their father step into the 
white light, his eyes searching the plant room. 

“Why did Dad come back?” Casey asked. 

“Sshhh!” Margaret held a finger to her lips. Then she climbed to her feet 
and pulled Casey toward the back door. “Come on. Hurry.” 

The back door was unlocked. They stepped into the kitchen just as their 
father emerged from the basement, a concerned expression on his face. “Hey 
—there you are! ” he exclaimed. 

“Hi, Dad,” Margaret said, trying to sound casual. “Why’d you come back?” 

“Had to get more tools,” he answered, studying their faces. He eyed them 
suspiciously. “Where were you two?” 

“Out in the backyard,” Margaret said quickly. “We came in when we heard 
the back door slam.” 

Dr. Brewer scowled and shook his head. “You never used to lie to me 
before,” he said. “I know you went down into the basement again. You left the 
door wide open.” 

“We just wanted to look,” Casey said quickly, glancing at Margaret, his 
expression fearful. 

“We found Mr. Martinez’s jacket and tie,” Margaret said. “What happened 
to him, Dad?” 

“Huh?” The question seemed to catch Dr. Brewer by surprise. 

“Why did he leave his jacket and tie down there?” Margaret asked. 

“I’m raising two snoops,” her father griped. “Martinez got hot, okay? I have 
to keep the basement at a very high, tropical temperature with lots of humidity. 



Martinez became uncomfortable. He removed his jacket and tie and put them 
down on the worktable. Then he forgot them when he left.” 

Dr. Brewer chuckled. “I think he was in a state of shock from everything I 
showed him down there. It’s no wonder he forgot his things. But I called 
Martinez this morning. I’m going to drive over and return his stuff when I finish 
at Mr. Henry’s.” 

Margaret saw a smile break out on Casey’s face. She felt relieved, too. It 
was good to know that Mr. Martinez was okay. 

How awful to suspect my own father of doing something terrible to 
someone, she thought. 

But she couldn’t help herself. The fear returned every time she saw him. 

“I’d better get going,” Dr. Brewer said. Carrying the tools he had picked up, 
he started toward the back door. But he stopped at the end of the hall and turned 
around. “Don’t go back in the basement, okay? It really could be dangerous. You 
could be very sorry.” 

Margaret listened to the screen door slam behind him. 

Was that a warning—or a threat? she wondered. 



16 


Margaret spent Saturday morning biking up in the golden hills with Diane. The 
sun burned through the morning smog, and the skies turned blue. A strong 
breeze kept them from getting too hot. The narrow road was lined with red and 
yellow wildflowers, and Margaret felt as if she were traveling somewhere far, far 
away. 

They had lunch at Diane’s house—tomato soup and avocado salad—then 
wandered back to Margaret’s house, trying to figure out how to spend the rest of 
a beautiful afternoon. 

Dr. Brewer was just backing the station wagon down the drive as Margaret 
and Diane rode up on their bikes. He rolled down the window, a broad smile on 
his face. “Good news!” he shouted. “Your mom is on her way home. I’m going 
to the airport to get her!” 

“Oh, that’s great!” Margaret exclaimed, so happy she could almost cry. 
Margaret and Diane waved and pedaled up the driveway. 

I’m so happy, Margaret thought. It’ll be so good to have her back. Someone 
I can talk to. Someone who can explain... about Dad. 

They looked through some old copies of Sassy and People in Margaret’s 
room, listening to some tapes that Margaret had recently bought. At a little past 
three, Diane suddenly remembered that she had a make-up piano lesson that she 
was late for. She rushed out of the house in a panic, jumped on her bike, yelled, 
“Say hi to your mom for me!” and disappeared down the drive. 

Margaret stood behind the house looking out at the rolling hills, wondering 
what to do next to make the time pass before her mother got home. The strong, 
swirling breeze felt cool against her face. She decided to get a book and go sit 
down with it under the shady sassafras tree in the middle of the yard. 

She turned and pulled open the kitchen door, and Casey came running up. 
“Where are our kites?” he asked, out of breath. 

“Kites? I don’t know. Why?” Margaret asked. “Hey—” She grabbed his 
shoulder to get his attention. “Mom’s coming home. She should be here in an 
hour or so.” 

“Great!” he cried. “Just enough time to fly some kites. It’s so windy. Come 
on. Want to fly ’em with me?” 



“Sure,” Margaret said. It would help pass the time. She thought hard, trying 
to remember where they put the kites. “Are they in the garage?” 

“No,” Casey told her. “I know. They’re in the basement. On those shelves. 
The string, too.” He pushed past her into the house. “I’ll jimmy the lock and go 
down and get them.” 

“Hey, Casey—be careful down there,” she called after him. He disappeared 
into the hallway. Margaret had second thoughts. She didn’t want Casey down 
there by himself in the plant room. “Wait up,” she called. “I’ll come with you.” 

They made their way down the stairs quickly, into the hot, steamy air, into 
the bright lights. 

The plants seemed to bend toward them, to reach out to them as they 
walked by. Margaret tried to ignore them. Walking right behind Casey, she kept 
her eyes on the tall metal shelves straight ahead. 

The shelves were deep and filled with old, unwanted toys, games, and 
sports equipment, a plastic tent, some old sleeping bags. Casey got there first and 
started rummaging around on the lower shelves. “I know they’re here 
somewhere,” he said. 

“Yeah. I remember storing them here,” Margaret said, running her eyes over 
the top shelves. 

Casey, down on his knees, started pulling boxes off the bottom shelf. 
Suddenly, he stopped. “Whoa—Margaret.” 

“Huh?” She took a step back. “What is it?” 

“Look at this,” Casey said softly. He pulled something out from behind the 
shelves, then stood up with it bundled in his hands. 

Margaret saw that he was holding a pair of black shoes. And a pair of blue 
trousers. 

Blue suit trousers? 

His face suddenly pale, his features drawn, Casey let the shoes drop to the 
floor. He unfurled the trousers and held them up in front of him. 

“Hey—look in the back pocket,” Margaret said, pointing. 

Casey reached into the back pocket and pulled out a black leather wallet. 

“I don’t believe this,” Margaret said. 

Casey’s hands trembled as he opened the wallet and searched inside. He 
pulled out a green American Express card and read the name on it. 

“It belongs to Mr. Martinez,” he said, swallowing hard. He raised his eyes 
to Margaret’s. “This is Mr. Martinez’s stuff.” 



17 


“Dad lied,” Casey said, staring in horror at the wallet in his hands. “Mr. Martinez 
might leave without his jacket. But he wouldn’t leave without his pants and 
shoes.” 

“But—what happened to him?” Margaret asked, feeling sick. 

Casey slammed the wallet shut. He shook his head sadly, but didn’t reply. 

In the center of the room, a plant seemed to groan, the sound startling the 
two kids. 

“Dad lied,” Casey repeated, staring down at the pants and shoes on the 
floor. “Dad lied to us.” 

“What are we going to do?” Margaret cried, panic and desperation in her 
voice. “We’ve got to tell someone what’s happening here. But who?” 

The plant groaned again. Tendrils snaked along the dirt. Leaves clapped 
against each other softly, wetly. 

And then the banging began again in the supply closet next to the shelves. 

Margaret stared at Casey. “That thumping. What is it?” 

They both listened to the insistent banging sounds. A low moan issued from 
the closet, followed by a higher-pitched one, both mournful, both very human¬ 
sounding. 

“I think someone’s in there!” Margaret exclaimed. 

“Maybe it’s Mr. Martinez,” Casey suggested, still gripping the wallet tightly 
in his hand. 

Thud thud thud. 

“Do you think we should open the closet?” Casey asked timidly. 

A plant groaned as if answering. 

“Yes. I think we should,” Margaret replied, suddenly cold all over. “If it’s 
Mr. Martinez in there, we’ve got to let him out.” 

Casey set the wallet down on the shelf. Then they moved quickly to the 
supply closet. 

Across from them, the plants seemed to shift and move as the two kids did. 
They heard breathing sounds, another groan, scurrying noises. Leaves bristled on 
their stalks. Tendrils drooped and slid. 

“Hey—look!” Casey cried. 



“I see,” Margaret said. The closet door wasn’t just locked. A two-by-four 
had been nailed over it. 

Thud thud. Thud thud thud. 

“There’s someone in there—I know it!” Margaret cried. 

“I’ll get the hammer,” Casey said. Keeping close to the wall and as far away 
from the plants as he could, he edged his way toward the worktable. 

A few seconds later, he returned with a claw hammer. 

Thud thud. 

Working together, they pried the two-by-four off the door. It clattered 
noisily to the floor. 

The banging from inside the supply closet grew louder, more insistent. 

“Now what do we do about the lock?” Margaret asked, staring at it. 

Casey scratched his head. They both had perspiration dripping down their 
faces. The steamy, hot air made it hard to catch their breaths. 

“I don’t know how to unlock it,” Casey said, stumped. 

“What if we tried to pry the door off the way we pulled off the two-by- 
four?” Margaret asked. 

Thud thud thud. 

Casey shrugged. “I don’t know. Let’s try.” 

Working the claw of the hammer into the narrow crack, they tried prying 
the door on the side of the lock. When it wouldn’t budge, they moved to the 
hinged side of the door and tried there. 

“It’s not moving,” Casey said, mopping his forehead with his arm. 

“Keep trying,” Margaret said. “Here. Let’s both push it.” 

Digging the claw in just above the lower hinge, they both pushed the handle 
of the hammer with all their strength. 

“It—it moved a little,” Margaret said, breathing hard. 

They kept at it. The wet wood began to crack. They both pushed against the 
hammer, wedging the claw into the crack. 

Finally, with a loud ripping sound, they managed to pull the door off. 

“Huh?” Casey dropped the hammer. 

They both squinted into the dark closet. 

And screamed in horror when they saw what was inside. 



18 


“Look!” Margaret cried, her heart thudding. She suddenly felt dizzy. She gripped 
the side of the closet to steady herself. 

“I—don’t believe this,” Casey said quietly, his voice trembling as he stared 
into the long, narrow supply closet. 

They both gaped at the weird plants that filled the closet. 

Were they plants? 

Under the dim ceiling bulb, they bent and writhed, groaning, breathing, 
sighing. Branches shook, leaves shimmered and moved, tall plants leaned 
forward as if reaching out to Margaret and Casey. 

“Look at that one!” Casey cried, taking a step back, stumbling into 
Margaret. “It has an arm!” 

“Ohh.” Margaret followed Casey’s stare. Casey was right. The tall, leafy 
plant appeared to have a green, human arm descending from its stalk. 

Margaret’s eyes darted around the closet. To her horror, she realized that 
several plants seemed to have human features—green arms, a yellow hand with 
three fingers poking from it, two stumpy legs where the stem should be. 

She and her brother both cried out when they saw the plant with the face. 
Inside a cluster of broad leaves there appeared to grow a round, green tomato. 
But the tomato had a human-shaped nose and an open mouth, from which it 
repeatedly uttered the most mournful sighs and groans. 

Another plant, a short plant with clusters of broad, oval leaves, had two 
green, nearly human faces partly hidden by the leaves, both wailing through 
open mouths. 

“Let’s get out of here!” Casey cried, grabbing Margaret’s hand in fear and 
tugging her away from the closet. “This is—gross!” 

The plants moaned and sighed. Green, fingerless hands reached out to 
Margaret and Casey. A yellow, sick-looking plant near the wall made choking 
sounds. A tall flowering plant staggered toward them, thin, tendril-like arms 
outstretched. 

“Wait!” Margaret cried, pulling her hand out of Casey’s. She spotted 
something on the closet floor behind the moaning, shifting plants. “Casey— 
what’s that?” she asked, pointing. 



She struggled to focus her eyes in the dim light of the closet. On the floor 
behind the plants, near the shelves on the back wall, were two human feet. 

Margaret stepped cautiously into the closet. The feet, she saw, were 
attached to legs. 

“Margaret—let’s go!” Casey pleaded. 

“No. Look. There’s someone back there,” Margaret said, staring hard. 

“Huh?” 

“A person. Not a plant,” Margaret said. She took another step. A soft green 
arm brushed against her side. 

“Margaret, what are you doing?” Casey asked, his voice high and 
frightened. 

“I have to see who it is,” Margaret said. 

She took a deep breath and held it. Then, ignoring the moans, the sighs, the 
green arms reaching out to her, the hideous green-tomato faces, she plunged 
through the plants to the back of the closet. 

“Dad!” she cried. 

Her father was lying on the floor, his hands and feet tied tightly with plant 
tendrils, his mouth gagged by a wide strip of elastic tape. 

“Margaret—” Casey was beside her. He lowered his eyes to the floor. “Oh, 

no!” 

Their father stared up at them, pleading with his eyes. “Mmmmm!” he 
cried, struggling to talk through the gag. 

Margaret dived to the floor and started to untie him. 

“No—stop!” Casey cried, and pulled her back by the shoulders. 

“Casey, let go of me. What’s wrong with you?” Margaret cried angrily. “It’s 
Dad. He—” 

“It can’t be Dad!” Casey said, still holding her by the shoulders. “Dad is at 
the airport—remember?” 

Behind them, the plants seemed to be moaning in unison, a terrifying 
chorus. A tall plant fell over and rolled toward the open closet door. 

“Mmmmmmm!” their father continued to plead, struggling at the tendrils 
that imprisoned him. 

“I’ve got to untie him,” Margaret told her brother. “Let go of me.” 

“No,” Casey insisted. “Margaret—look at his head.” 

Margaret turned her eyes to her father’s head. He was bareheaded. No 
Dodgers cap. He had tufts of green leaves growing where his hair should be. 



“We’ve already seen that,” Margaret snapped. “It’s a side effect, 
remember?” She reached down to pull at her father’s ropes. 

“No—don’t!” Casey insisted. 

“Okay, okay,” Margaret said. “I’ll just pull the tape off his mouth. I won’t 
untie him.” 

She reached down and tugged at the elastic tape until she managed to get it 
off. 

“Kids—I’m so glad to see you,” Dr. Brewer said. “Quick! Untie me.” 

“How did you get in here?” Casey demanded, standing above him, hands on 
his hips, staring down at him suspiciously. “We saw you leave for the airport.” 

“That wasn’t me,” Dr. Brewer said. “I’ve been locked in here for days.” 

“Huh?” Casey cried. 

“But we saw you—” Margaret started. 

“It wasn’t me. It’s a plant,” Dr. Brewer said. “It’s a plant copy of me.” 

“Dad—” Casey said. 

“Please. There’s no time to explain,” their father said urgently, raising his 
leaf-covered head to look toward the closet doorway. “Just untie me. Quick!” 

“The father we’ve been living with? He’s a plant?” Margaret cried, 
swallowing hard. 

“Yes. Please—untie me!” 

Margaret reached for the tendrils. 

“No!” Casey insisted. “How do we know you’re telling the truth?” 

“I’ll explain everything. I promise,” he pleaded. “Hurry. Our lives are at 
stake. Mr. Martinez is in here, too.” 

Startled, Margaret turned her eyes to the far wall. Sure enough, Mr. 
Martinez also lay on the floor, bound and gagged. 

“Let me out—please!” her father cried. 

Behind them, plants moaned and cried. 

Margaret couldn’t stand it anymore. “I’m untying him,” she told Casey, and 
bent down to start grappling with the tendrils. 

Her father sighed gratefully. Casey bent down and reluctantly began 
working at the tendrils, too. 

Finally, they had loosened them enough so their father could slip out. He 
climbed to his feet slowly, stretching his arms, moving his legs, bending his 
knees. “Man, that feels good,” he said, giving Margaret and Casey a grim smile. 

“Dad—should we untie Mr. Martinez?” Margaret asked. 



But, without warning, Dr. Brewer pushed past the two kids and made his 
way out of the closet. 

“Dad—whoa! Where are you going?” Margaret called. 

“You said you’d explain everything!” Casey insisted. He and his sister ran 
through the moaning plants, following their father. 

“I will. I will.” Breathing hard, Dr. Brewer strode quickly to the woodpile 
against the far wall. 

Margaret and Casey both gasped as he picked up an axe. 

He spun around to face them, holding the thick axe handle with both hands. 
His face frozen with determination, he started toward them. 

“Dad—what are you doing?” Margaret cried. 



19 


Swinging the axe onto his shoulder, Dr. Brewer advanced on Margaret and 
Casey. He groaned from the effort of raising the heavy tool, his face reddening, 
his eyes wide, excited. 

“Dad, please!” Margaret cried, gripping Casey’s shoulder, backing up 
toward the jungle of plants in the center of the room. 

“What are you doing?” she repeated. 

“He’s not our real father!” Casey cried. “I told you we shouldn’t untie 
him!” 

“He is our real father!” Margaret insisted. “I know he is!” She turned her 
eyes to her father, looking for an answer. 

But he stared back at them, his face filled with confusion—and menace, the 
axe in his hands gleaming under the bright ceiling lights. 

“Dad—answer us!” Margaret demanded. “Answer us!” 

Before Dr. Brewer could reply, they heard loud, rapid footsteps clumping 
down the basement steps. 

All four of them turned to the doorway of the plant room—to see an 
alarmed-looking Dr. Brewer enter. He grabbed the bill of his Dodgers cap as he 
strode angrily toward the two kids. 

“What are you two doing down here?” he cried. “You promised me. Here’s 
your mother. Don’t you want to—?” 

Mrs. Brewer appeared at his side. She started to call out a greeting, but 
stopped, freezing in horror when she saw the confusing scene. 

“No!” she screamed, seeing the other Dr. Brewer, the capless Dr. Brewer, 
holding an axe in front of him with both hands. “No!” Her face filled with 
horror. She turned to the Dr. Brewer that had just brought her home. 

He glared accusingly at Margaret and Casey. “What have you done? You let 
him escape?” 

“He’s our dad,” Margaret said, in a tiny little voice she barely recognized. 

“I’m your dad!” the Dr. Brewer at the doorway bellowed. “Not him! He’s 
not your dad. He’s not even human! He’s a plant!” 

Margaret and Casey both gasped and drew back in terror. 

“You’re the plant!” the bareheaded Dr. Brewer accused, raising the axe. 



“He’s dangerous!” the other Dr. Brewer exclaimed. “How could you have 
let him out?” 

Caught in the middle, Margaret and Casey stared from one father to the 
other. 

Who was their real father? 



20 


“That’s not your father!” Dr. Brewer with the Dodgers cap cried again, moving 
into the room. “He’s a copy. A plant copy. One of my experiments that went 
wrong. I locked him in the supply closet because he’s dangerous.” 

“You’re the copy!” the other Dr. Brewer accused, and raised the axe again. 

Margaret and Casey stood motionless, exchanging terrified glances. 

“Kids—what have you done?” Mrs. Brewer cried, her hands pressed against 
her cheeks, her eyes wide with disbelief. 

“What have we done?” Margaret asked her brother in a low voice. 

Staring wide-eyed from one man to the other, Casey seemed too frightened 
to reply. 

“I—I don’t know what to do,” Casey managed to whisper. 

What can we do? Margaret wondered silently, realizing that her entire body 
was trembling. 

“He has to be destroyed!” the axe-wielding Dr. Brewer shouted, staring at 
his look-alike across the room. 

Beside them, plants quivered and shook, sighing loudly. Tendrils slithered 
across the dirt. Leaves shimmered and whispered. 

“Put down the axe. You’re not fooling anyone,” the other Dr. Brewer said. 

“You have to be destroyed!” Dr. Brewer with no cap repeated, his eyes 
wild, his face scarlet, moving closer, the axe gleaming as if electrified under the 
white light. 

Dad would never act like this, Margaret realized. Casey and I were idiots. 
We let him out of the closet. And now he’s going to kill our real dad. And mom. 

And then... us! 

What can I do? she wondered, trying to think clearly even though her mind 
was whirring wildly out of control. 

What can I do? 

Uttering a desperate cry of protest, Margaret leapt forward and grabbed the 
axe from the imposter’s hands. 

He gaped in surprise as she steadied her grip on the handle. It was heavier 
than she’d imagined. “Get back!” she screamed. “Get back—now!” 

“Margaret—wait!” her mother cried, still too frightened to move from the 



doorway. 

The capless Dr. Brewer reached for the axe. “Give it back to me! You don’t 
know what you’re doing!” he pleaded, and made a wild grab for it. 

Margaret pulled back and swung the axe. “Stay back. Everyone, stay back.” 

“Thank goodness!” Dr. Brewer with the Dodgers cap exclaimed. “We’ve 
got to get him back in the closet. He’s very dangerous.” He stepped up to 
Margaret. “Give me the axe.” 

Margaret hesitated. 

“Give me the axe,” he insisted. 

Margaret turned to her mother. “What should I do?” 

Mrs. Brewer shrugged helplessly. “I—I don’t know.” 

“Princess—don’t do it,” the capless Dr. Brewer said softly, staring into 
Margaret’s eyes. 

He called me Princess, Margaret realized. 

The other one never had. 

Does this mean that the Dad in the closet is my real dad? 

“Margaret—give me the axe.” The one in the cap made a grab for it. 

Margaret backed away and swung the axe again. 

“Get back! Both of you—stay back!” she warned. 

“I’m warning you,” Dr. Brewer in the cap said. “He’s dangerous. Listen to 
me, Margaret.” 

“Get back!” she repeated, desperately trying to decide what to do. 

Which one is my real dad? 

Which one? Which one? Which one? 

Her eyes darting back and forth from one to the other, she saw that each of 
them had a bandage around his right hand. And it gave her an idea. 

“Casey, there’s a knife on the wall over there,” she said, still holding the axe 
poised. “Get it for me—fast!” 

Casey obediently hurried to the wall. It took him a short while to find the 
knife among all the tools hanging there. He reached up on tiptoes to pull it down, 
then hurried back to Margaret with it. 

Margaret lowered the axe and took the long-bladed knife from him. 

“Margaret—give me the axe,” the man in the Dodgers cap insisted 
impatiently. 

“Margaret, what are you doing?” the man from the supply closet asked, 
suddenly looking frightened. 



“I—I have an idea,” Margaret said hesitantly. 

She took a deep breath. 

Then she stepped over to the man from the supply closet and pushed the 
knife blade into his arm. 



21 


“Ow!” he cried out as the blade cut through the skin. 

Margaret pulled the knife back, having made a tiny puncture hole. 

Red blood trickled from the hole. 

“He’s our real dad,” she told Casey, sighing with relief. “Here, Dad.” She 
handed him the axe. 

“Margaret—you’re wrong!” the man in the baseball cap cried in alarm. 
“He’s tricked you! He’s tricked you!” 

The capless Dr. Brewer moved quickly. He picked up the axe, took three 
steps forward, pulled the axe back, and swung with all his might. 

The Dr. Brewer in the cap opened his mouth wide and uttered a hushed cry 
of alarm. The cry was choked off as the axe cut easily through his body, slicing 
him in two. 

A thick green liquid oozed from the wound. And as the man fell, his mouth 
locking open in disbelief and horror, Margaret could see that his body was 
actually a stem. He had no bones, no human organs. 

The body thudded to the floor. Green liquid puddled around it. 

“Princess—we’re okay!” Dr. Brewer cried, flinging the axe aside. “You 
guessed right!” 

“It wasn’t a guess,” Margaret said, sinking into his arms. “I remembered the 
green blood. I saw it. Late at night. One of you was in the bathroom, bleeding 
green blood. I knew my real dad would have red blood.” 

“We’re okay!” Mrs. Brewer cried, rushing into her husband’s arms. “We’re 
okay. We’re all okay!” 

All four of them rushed together in an emotional family hug. 

“One more thing we have to do,” their father said, his arms around the two 
kids. “Let’s get Mr. Martinez out of the closet.” 

By dinnertime, things had almost returned to normal. 

They had finally managed to welcome their mother home, and tried to 
explain to her all that had happened in her absence. 

Mr. Martinez had been rescued from the supply closet, not too much the 
worse for wear. He and Dr. Brewer had had a long discussion about what had 



happened and about Dr. Brewer’s work. 

He expressed total bewilderment as to what Dr. Brewer had accomplished, 
but he knew enough to realize that it was historic. “Perhaps you need the 
structured environment the lab on campus offers. I’ll talk to the board members 
about getting you back on staff,” Martinez said. It was his way of inviting their 
father back to work. 

After Mr. Martinez was driven home, Dr. Brewer disappeared into the 
basement for about an hour. He returned grim-faced and exhausted. “I destroyed 
most of the plants,” he explained, sinking into an armchair. “I had to. They were 
suffering. Later, I’ll destroy the rest.” 

“Every single plant?” Mrs. Brewer asked. 

“Well... there are a few normal ones that I can plant out back in the 
garden,” he replied. He shook his head sadly. “Only a few.” 

At dinner, he finally had the strength to explain to Margaret, Casey, and 
Mrs. Brewer what had happened down in the basement. 

“I was working on a super plant,” he said, “trying to electronically make a 
new plant using DNA elements from other plants. Then I accidentally cut my 
hand on a slide. I didn’t realize it, but some of my blood got mixed in with the 
plant molecules I was using. When I turned on the machine, my molecules got 
mixed in with plant molecules—and I ended up with something that was part 
human, part plant.” 

“That’s gross!” Casey exclaimed, dropping a forkful of mashed potatoes. 

“Well, I’m a scientist,” Dr. Brewer replied, “so I didn’t think it was gross. I 
thought it was pretty exciting. I mean, here I was, inventing an entirely new kind 
of creature.” 

“Those plants with faces—” Margaret started. 

Her father nodded. “Yes. Those were things I made by inserting human 
materials into plant materials. I kept putting them in the supply closet. I got 
carried away. I didn’t know how far I could go, how human I could make the 
plants. I could see that my creations were unhappy, suffering. But I couldn’t 
stop. It was too exciting.” 

He took a long drink of water from his glass. 

“You didn’t tell me any of this,” Mrs. Brewer said, shaking her head. 

“I couldn’t,” he said. “I couldn’t tell anyone. I—I was too involved. Then 
one day, I went too far. I created a plant that was an exact copy of me in almost 
every way. He looked like me. He sounded like me. And he had my brain, my 



mind.” 

“But he still acted like a plant in some ways,” Margaret said. “He ate plant 
food and—” 

“He wasn’t perfect,” Dr. Brewer said, leaning forward over the dinner table, 
talking in a low, serious voice. “He had flaws. But he was strong enough and 
smart enough to overpower me, to lock me in the closet, to take my place—and 
to continue my experiments. And when Martinez arrived unexpectedly, he 
locked Martinez in the closet, too, so that his secret would be safe.” 

“Was the head full of leaves one of the flaws?” Casey asked. 

Dr. Brewer nodded. “Yes, he was almost a perfect clone of me, almost a 
perfect human, but not quite.” 

“But, Dad,” Margaret said, pointing, “you have leaves on your head, too.” 

He reached up and pulled one off. “I know,” he said, making a disgusted 
face. “That’s really gross, huh?” 

Everyone agreed. 

“Well, when I cut my hand, some of the plant materials mixed with my 
blood, got into my system,” he explained. “And then I turned on the machine. 
The machine created a strong chemical reaction between the plant materials and 
my blood. Then, my hair fell out overnight. And the leaves immediately started 
to sprout. Don’t worry, guys. The leaves are falling out already. I think my hair 
will grow back.” 

Margaret and Casey cheered. 

“I guess things will return to normal around here,” Mrs. Brewer said, 
smiling at her husband. 

“Better than normal,” he said, smiling back. “If Martinez convinces the 
board to give me my job back, I’ll clear out the basement and turn it into the best 
game room you ever saw!” 

Margaret and Casey cheered again. 

“We’re all alive and safe,” Dr. Brewer said, hugging both kids at once. 
“Thanks to you two.” 

It was the happiest dinner Margaret could remember. After they had cleaned 
up, they all went out for ice cream. It was nearly ten o’clock when they returned. 

Dr. Brewer headed for the basement. 

“Hey—where are you going?” his wife called suspiciously. 

“I’m just going down to deal with the rest of the plants,” Dr. Brewer 
assured her. “I want to make sure that everything is gone, that this horrible 



chapter in our lives is over.” 

By the end of the week, most of the plants had been destroyed. A giant pile of 
leaves, roots, and stalks were burned in a bonfire that lasted for hours. A few tiny 
plants had been transplanted outside. All of the equipment had been dismantled 
and trucked to the university. 

On Saturday, all four Brewers went to select a pool table for the new 
basement rec room. On Sunday, Margaret found herself standing in back by the 
garden, staring up at the golden hills. 

It’s so peaceful now, she thought happily. 

So peaceful here. And so beautiful. 

The smile faded from her face when she heard the whisper at her feet. 
“Margaret.” 

She looked down to see a small yellow flower nudging her ankle. 
“Margaret,” the flower whispered, “help me. Please—help me. I’m your 
father. Really! I’m your real father.” 




MONSTER BLOOD

“I don’t want to stay here. Please don’t leave me here.” 

Evan Ross tugged his mother’s hand, trying to pull her away from the front 
stoop of the small, gray-shingled house. Mrs. Ross turned to him, an impatient 
frown on her face. 

“Evan—you’re twelve years old. Don’t act like an infant,” she said, freeing 
her hand from his grasp. 

“I hate when you say that!” Evan exclaimed angrily, crossing his arms in 
front of his chest. 

Softening her expression, she reached out and ran her hand tenderly through 
Evan’s curly, carrot-colored hair. “And I hate when you do that!” he cried, 
backing away from her, nearly stumbling over a broken flagstone in the walk. 
“Don’t touch my hair. I hate it!” 

“Okay, so you hate me,” his mother said with a shrug. She climbed up the 
two steps and knocked on the front door. “You still have to stay here till I get 
back.” 

“Why can’t I come with you?” Evan demanded, keeping his arms crossed. 
“Just give me one good reason.” 

“Your sneaker is untied,” his mother replied. 

“So?” Evan replied unhappily. “I like ’em untied.” 

“You’ll trip,” she warned. 

“Mom,” Evan said, rolling his eyes in exasperation, “have you ever seen 
anyone trip over his sneakers because they were untied?” 

“Well, no,” his mother admitted, a smile slowly forming on her pretty face. 

“You just want to change the subject,” Evan said, not smiling back. “You’re 
going to leave me here for weeks with a horrible old woman and—” 

“Evan—that’s enough !” Mrs. Ross snapped, tossing back her straight 
blonde hair. “Kathryn is not a horrible old woman. She’s your father’s aunt. Your 
great-aunt. And she’s—” 

“She’s a total stranger,” Evan cried. He knew he was losing control, but he 
didn’t care. How could his mother do this to him? How could she leave him with 
some old lady he hadn’t seen since he was two? What was he supposed to do 
here all by himself until his mother got back? 



“Evan, we’ve discussed this a thousand times,” his mother said impatiently, 
pounding on his aunt’s front door again. “This is a family emergency. I really 
expect you to cooperate a little better.” 

Her next words were drowned out by Trigger, Evan’s cocker spaniel, who 
stuck his tan head out of the back window of the rented car and began barking 
and howling. 

“Now he’s giving me a hard time, too!” Mrs. Ross exclaimed. 

“Can I let him out?” Evan asked eagerly. 

“I guess you’d better,” his mother replied. “Trigger’s so old, we don’t want 
him to have a heart attack in there. I just hope he doesn’t terrify Kathryn.” 

“I’m coming, Trigger!” Evan called. 

He jogged to the gravel driveway and pulled open the car door. With an 
excited yip, Trigger leapt out and began running in wide circles around 
Kathryn’s small, rectangular front yard. 

“He doesn’t look like he’s twelve,” Evan said, watching the dog run, and 
smiling for the first time that day. 

“See. You’ll have Trigger for company,” Mrs. Ross said, turning back to the 
front door. “I’ll be back from Atlanta in no time. A couple of weeks at the most. 
I’m sure your dad and I can find a house in that time. And then we’ll be back 
before you even notice we’re gone.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Evan said sarcastically. 

The sun dipped behind a large cloud. A shadow fell over the small front 

yard. 

Trigger wore himself out quickly and came panting up the walk, his tongue 
hanging nearly to the ground. Evan bent down and petted the dog’s back. 

He looked up at the gray house as his mother knocked on the front door 
again. It looked dark and uninviting. There were curtains drawn over the upstairs 
windows. One of the shutters had come loose and was resting at an odd angle. 

“Mom—why are you knocking?” he asked, shoving his hands into his jeans 
pockets. “You said Aunt Kathryn was totally deaf.” 

“Oh.” His mother’s face reddened. “You got me so upset, Evan, with all 
your complaining, I completely forgot. Of course she can’t hear us.” 

How am I going to spend two weeks with a strange old lady who can’t even 
hear me? Evan wondered glumly. 

He remembered eavesdropping on his parents two weeks earlier when they 
had made the plan. They were seated across from each other at the kitchen table. 



They thought Evan was out in the backyard. But he was in the hallway, his back 
pressed against the wall, listening. 

His father, he learned, was reluctant to leave Evan with Kathryn. “She’s a 
very stubborn old woman,” Mr. Ross had said. “Look at her. Deaf for twenty 
years, and she’s refused to learn sign language or to lip-read. How’s she going to 
take care of Evan?” 

“She took good care of you when you were a boy,” Mrs. Ross had argued. 

“That was thirty years ago,” Mr. Ross protested. 

“Well, we have no choice,” Evan heard his mother say. “There’s no one else 
to leave him with. Everyone else is away on vacation. You know, August is just 
the worst month for you to be transferred to Atlanta.” 

“Well, excuuuuse me!” Mr. Ross said sarcastically. “Okay, okay. Discussion 
closed. You’re absolutely right, dear. We have no choice. Kathryn it is. You’ll 
drive Evan there and then fly down to Atlanta.” 

“It’ll be a good experience for him,” Evan heard his mother say. “He needs 
to learn how to get along under difficult circumstances. You know, moving to 
Atlanta, leaving all his friends behind—that isn’t going to be easy on Evan 
either.” 

“Okay. I said okay,” Mr. Ross said impatiently. “It’s settled. Evan will be 
fine. Kathryn is a bit weird, but she’s perfectly harmless.” 

Evan heard the kitchen chairs scraping across the linoleum, indicating that 
his parents were getting up, their discussion ended. 

His fate was sealed. Silently, he had made his way out the front door and 
around to the backyard to think about what he had just overheard. 

He leaned against the trunk of the big maple tree, which hid him from the 
house. It was his favorite place to think. 

Why didn’t his parents ever include him in their discussions? he wondered. 
If they were going to discuss leaving him with some old aunt he’d never seen 
before, shouldn’t he at least have a say? He learned all the big family news by 
eavesdropping from the hallway. It just wasn’t right. 

Evan pulled a small twig off the ground and tapped it against the broad tree 
trunk. 

Aunt Kathryn was weird. That’s what his dad had said. She was so weird, 
his father didn’t want to leave Evan with her. 

But they had no choice. No choice. 

Maybe they’ll change their minds and take me to Atlanta with them, Evan 



thought. Maybe they’ll realize they can’t do this to me. 

But now, two weeks later, he was standing in front of Aunt Kathryn’s gray 
house, feeling very nervous, staring at the brown suitcase filled with his 
belongings, which stood beside his mother on the stoop. 

There’s nothing to be scared of, he assured himself. 

It’s only for two weeks. Maybe less. 

But then the words popped out before he’d even had a chance to think about 
them: “Mom—what if Aunt Kathryn is mean?” 

“Huh?” The question caught his mother by surprise. “Mean? Why would 
she be mean, Evan?” 

And as she said this, facing Evan with her back to the house, the front door 
was pulled open, and Aunt Kathryn, a large woman with startling black hair, 
filled the doorway. 

Staring past his mother, Evan saw the knife in Kathryn’s hand. And he saw 
that the blade of the knife was dripping with blood.

Trigger raised his head and began to bark, hopping backward on his hind legs 
with each bark. 

Startled, Evan’s mother spun around, nearly stumbling off the small stoop. 

Evan gaped in silent horror at the knife. 

A smile formed on Kathryn’s face, and she pushed open the screen door 
with her free hand. 

She wasn’t anything like Evan had pictured. He had pictured a small, frail¬ 
looking, white-haired old lady. But Kathryn was a large woman, very robust, 
broad-shouldered, and tall. 

She wore a peach-colored housedress and had straight black hair, pulled 
back and tied behind her head in a long ponytail that flowed down the back of 
the dress. She wore no makeup, and her pale face seemed to disappear under the 
striking black hair, except for her eyes, which were large and round, and steely 
blue. 

“I was slicing beef,” she said in a surprisingly deep voice, waving the 
blood-stained kitchen knife. She stared at Evan. “You like beef?” 

“Uh... yeah,” he managed to reply, his chest still fluttery from the shock of 
seeing her appear with the raised knife. 

Kathryn held open the screen door, but neither Evan nor his mother made 
any move to go inside. “He’s big,” Kathryn said to Mrs. Ross. “A big boy. Not 
like his father. I used to call his father Chicken. Because he was no bigger than a 
chicken.” She laughed as if she had cracked a funny joke. 

Mrs. Ross, picking up Evan’s suitcase, glanced uncomfortably back at him. 
“Yeah... he’s big,” she said. 

Actually, Evan was one of the shortest kids in his class. And no matter how 
much he ate, he remained “as skinny as a spaghetti noodle,” as his dad liked to 
say. 

“You don’t have to answer me,” Kathryn said, stepping aside so that Mrs. 
Ross could get inside the house with the suitcase. “I can’t hear you.” Her voice 
was deep, as deep as a man’s, and she spoke clearly, without the indistinct 
pronunciation that some deaf people have. 

Evan followed his mother into the front hallway, Trigger yapping at his 



heels. “Can’t you get that dog quiet?” his mother snapped. 

“It doesn’t matter. She can’t hear it,” Evan replied, gesturing toward his 
aunt, who was heading to the kitchen to put down the knife. 

Kathryn returned a few seconds later, her blue eyes locked on Evan, her lips 
pursed, as if she were studying him. “So, you like beef?” she repeated. 

He nodded. 

“Good,” she said, her expression still serious. “I always fixed beef for your 
father. But he only wanted pie.” 

“What kind of pie?” Evan asked, and then blushed when he remembered 
Kathryn couldn’t hear him. 

“So he’s a good boy? Not a troublemaker?” Kathryn asked Evan’s mother. 

Mrs. Ross nodded, looking at Evan. “Where shall we put his suitcase?” she 
asked. 

“I can tell by looking he’s a good boy,” Kathryn said. She reached out and 
grabbed Evan’s face, her big hand holding him under the chin, her eyes 
examining him closely. “Good-looking boy,” she said, giving his chin a hard 
squeeze. “He likes the girls?” 

Still holding his chin, she lowered her face to his. “You’ve got a 
girlfriend?” she asked, her pale face right above his, so close he could smell her 
breath, which was sour. 

Evan took a step back, an embarrassed grin crossing his face. “No. Not 
really.” 

“Yes?” Kathryn cried, bellowing in his ear. “Yes? I knew it!” She laughed 
heartily, turning her gaze to Evan’s mother. 

“The suitcase?” Mrs. Ross asked, picking up the bag. 

“He likes the girls, huh?” Kathryn repeated, still chuckling. “I could tell. 
Just like his father. His father always liked the girls.” 

Evan turned desperately to his mother. “Mom, I can’t stay here,” he said, 
whispering even though he knew Kathryn couldn’t hear. “Please—don’t make 
me.” 

“Hush,” his mother replied, also whispering. “She’ll leave you alone. I 
promise. She’s just trying to be friendly.” 

“He likes the girls,” Kathryn repeated, leering at him with her cold blue 
eyes, again lowering her face close to Evan’s. 

“Mom—her breath smells like Trigger’s!” Evan exclaimed miserably. 

“Evan!” Mrs. Ross shouted angrily. “Stop it! I expect you to cooperate.” 



“I’m going to bake you a pie,” Kathryn said, tugging at her black ponytail 
with one of her huge hands. “Would you like to roll out the dough? I’ll bet you 
would. What did your father tell you about me, Evan?” She winked at Mrs. Ross. 
“Did he tell you I was a scary old witch?” 

“No,” Evan protested, looking at his mother. 

“Well, I am!” Kathryn declared, and once again burst into her deep-throated 
laugh. 

Trigger took this moment to begin barking ferociously and jumping on 
Evan’s great-aunt. She glared down at the dog, her eyes narrowing, her 
expression becoming stern. “Look out or we’ll put you in the pie, doggie!” she 
exclaimed. 

Trigger barked even harder, darting boldly toward the tall, hovering woman, 
then quickly retreating, his stub of a tail whipping back and forth in a frenzy. 

“We’ll put him in the pie, won’t we, Evan?” Kathryn repeated, putting a big 
hand on Evan’s shoulder and squeezing it till Evan flinched in pain. 

“Mom—” he pleaded when his aunt finally let go and, smiling, made her 
way to the kitchen. “Mom—please.” 

“It’s just her sense of humor, Evan,” Mrs. Ross said uncertainly. “She 
means well. Really. She’s going to bake you a pie.” 

“But I don’t want pie!” Evan wailed. “I don’t like it here, Mom! She hurt 
me. She squeezed my shoulder so hard—” 

“Evan, I’m sure she didn’t mean to. She’s just trying to joke with you. She 
wants you to like her. Give her a chance—okay?” 

Evan started to protest, but thought better of it. 

“I’m counting on you,” his mother continued, turning her eyes to the 
kitchen. They could both see Kathryn at the counter, her broad back to them, 
hacking away at something with the big kitchen knife. 

“But she’s... weird!” Evan protested. 

“Listen, Evan, I understand how you’re feeling,” his mother said. “But you 
won’t have to spend all your time with her. There are a lot of kids in this 
neighborhood. Take Trigger for a walk. I’ll bet you’ll make some friends your 
age. She’s an old woman, Evan. She won’t want you hanging around all the 
time.” 

“I guess,” Evan muttered. 

His mother bent down suddenly and gave him a hug, pressing her cheek 
against his. The hug, he knew, was supposed to cheer him up. But it only made 



him feel worse. 

“I’m counting on you,” his mother repeated in his ear. 

Evan decided to try and be braver about this. “I’ll help you carry the 
suitcase up to my room,” he said. 

They carried it up the narrow staircase. His room was actually a study. The 
walls were lined with bookshelves filled with old hardcover books. A large 
mahogany desk stood in the center of the room. A narrow cot had been made up 
under the single, curtained window. 

The window faced out onto the backyard, a long green rectangle with the 
gray-shingled garage to the left, a tall picket fence to the right. A small, fenced- 
in area stretched across the back of the yard. It looked like some sort of dog run. 

The room smelled musty. The sharp aroma of mothballs invaded Evan’s 

nose. 

Trigger sneezed. He rolled onto his back, his legs racing in the air. 

Trigger can’t stand this place either, Evan thought. But he kept his thought 
to himself, smiling bravely at his mother, who quickly unpacked his suitcase, 
nervously checking her watch. 

“I’m late. Don’t want to miss my plane,” she said. She gave him another 
hug, longer this time. Then she took a ten-dollar bill from her pocket-book and 
stuffed it into his shirt pocket. “Buy yourself a treat. Be good. I’ll hurry back as 
fast as I can.” 

“Okay. Bye,” he said, his chest feeling fluttery, his throat as dry as cotton. 
The smell of her perfume momentarily drowned out the mothballs. 

He didn’t want her to leave. He had such a bad feeling. 

You’re just scared, he scolded himself. 

“I’ll call you from Atlanta,” she shouted as she disappeared down the stairs 
to say good-bye to Kathryn. 

Her perfume disappeared. 

The mothballs returned. 

Trigger uttered a low, sad howl, as if he knew what was happening, as if he 
knew they were being abandoned here in this strange house with the strange old 
woman. 

Evan picked Trigger up and nose-kissed his cold, black nose. Putting the 
dog back down on the worn carpet, he made his way to the window. 

He stood there for a long while, one hand holding the curtains aside, staring 
down at the small, green yard, trying to calm the fluttering in his chest. After a 



few minutes, he heard his mother’s car back down the gravel drive. Then he 
heard it roll away. 

When he could no longer hear it, he sighed and plopped down on the cot. 
“It’s just you and me now, Trigger,” he said glumly. 

Trigger was busily sniffing behind the door. 

Evan stared up at the walls of old books. 

What am I going to do here all day? he asked himself, propping his head in 
his hands. No Nintendo. No computer. He hadn’t even seen a TV in his great- 
aunt’s small living room. What am I going to do? 

Sighing again, he picked himself up and walked along the bookshelves, his 
eyes scanning the titles. There were lots of science books and textbooks, he saw. 
Books on biology and astronomy, ancient Egypt, chemistry texts, and medical 
books. Several shelves were filled with dusty, yellowed books. Maybe Kathryn’s 
husband, Evan’s great-uncle, had been some sort of scientist. 

Nothing here for me to read, he thought glumly. 

He pulled open the closet door. 

“Oh!” 

He cried out as something leapt out at him. 

“Help! Please—help!” 

Everything went black. 

“Help! I can’t see!” Evan screamed. 



3 


Evan staggered back in fear as the warm blackness crept over him. 

It took him a few seconds to realize what it was. His heart still thudding in 
his chest, he reached up and pulled the screeching black cat off his face. 

The cat dropped silently to the ground and padded to the doorway. Evan 
turned and saw Kathryn standing there, an amused grin on her face. 

How long had she been standing there? he wondered. 

“Sarabeth, how did you get in there?” she asked in a playfully scolding 
tone, bending down to speak to the cat. “You must have given the boy a fright.” 

The cat mewed and rubbed against Kathryn’s bare leg. 

“Did Sarabeth scare you?” Kathryn asked Evan, still smiling. “That cat has 
a strange sense of humor. She’s evil. Pure evil.” She chuckled as if she’d said 
something funny. 

“I’m okay,” Evan said uncertainly. 

“Watch out for Sarabeth. She’s evil,” Kathryn repeated, bending down and 
picking the cat up by the scruff of the neck, holding her up in the air in front of 
her. “Evil, evil, evil.” 

Seeing the cat suspended in the air, Trigger uttered an unhappy howl. His 
stubby tail went into motion, and he leapt up at the cat, barking and yipping, 
missed, and leapt again, snapping at Sarabeth’s tail. 

“Down, Trigger! Get down!” Evan cried. 

Struggling to get out of Kathryn’s arms, the cat swiped a clawed black paw 
at her, screeching in anger and fear. Trigger barked and howled as Evan 
struggled to pull the excited cocker spaniel away. 

Evan grabbed hold of Trigger as the cat swung to the floor and disappeared 
out the door. “Bad dog. Bad dog,” Evan whispered. But he didn’t really mean it. 
He was glad Trigger had scared the cat away. 

He looked up to see Kathryn still filling the doorway, staring down at him 
sternly. “Bring the dog,” she said in a low voice, her eyes narrowed, her pale lips 
pursed tightly. 

“Huh?” Evan gripped Trigger in a tight hug. 

“Bring the dog,” Kathryn repeated coldly. “We can’t have animals fighting 
in this house.” 



“But Aunt Kathryn—” Evan started to plead, then remembered she couldn’t 
hear him. 

“Sarabeth is a bad one,” Kathryn said, not softening her expression. “We 
can’t get her riled, can we?” She turned and started down the stairs. “Bring the 
dog, Evan.” 

Holding Trigger tightly by the shoulders with both hands, Evan hesitated. 

“I have to take care of the dog,” Kathryn said sternly. “Come.” 

Evan was suddenly filled with dread. What did she mean, take care of the 

dog? 

A picture flashed into his mind of Kathryn standing at the doorway with the 
bloody kitchen knife in her hand. 

“Bring the dog,” Kathryn insisted. 

Evan gasped. What was she going to do to Trigger? 



4 


“I will take care of you, doggie,” Kathryn repeated, frowning at Trigger. The dog 
whimpered in reply. 

“Come, Evan. Follow me,” she said impatiently. 

Seeing that he had no choice, Evan obediently carried Trigger down the 
stairs and followed his aunt to the backyard. “I’m prepared,” she said, turning to 
make sure he was following. 

Despite her age—she was at least eighty—she walked with long, steady 
strides. “I knew you were bringing a dog, so I made sure I was prepared.” 

Trigger licked Evan’s hand as they walked across the yard to the long, 
fenced-in area at the back. “It’s a special place for your dog,” Kathryn said, 
reaching up to grab one end of the rope that stretched across the run. “Attach this 
to the collar, Evan. Your dog will have fun here.” She frowned disapprovingly at 
Trigger. “And there will be no problems with Sarabeth.” 

Evan felt very relieved that this was all Kathryn wanted to do to Trigger. 
But he didn’t want to leave Trigger tied up in this prison in the back of the yard. 
Trigger was a house dog. He wouldn’t be happy by himself out here. 

But Evan knew he had no way of arguing with his aunt. Kathryn is smart in 
a way, he thought bitterly as he hooked Trigger’s collar to the rope. Since she 
won’t learn sign language and won’t lip-read, it means she gets to do whatever 
she wants, and no one can tell her no. 

He bent down and gave Trigger’s warm head a pat and looked up at the old 
woman. She had her arms crossed in front of her chest, her blue eyes glowing 
brightly in the sunlight, a cold smile of triumph on her face. 

“That’s a good boy,” she said, waiting for Evan to get up before starting 
back to the house. “I knew when I looked at you. Come to the house, Evan. I 
have cookies and milk. You’ll enjoy them.” Her words were kind, but her voice 
was hard and cold. 

Trigger sent up an unhappy howl as Evan followed Kathryn to the house. 
Evan turned, intending to go back and comfort the dog. But Kathryn grabbed his 
hand in an iron grip, and, staring straight ahead, led him to the kitchen door. 

The kitchen was small and cluttered and very warm. Kathryn motioned for 
him to sit at a small table against the wall. The table was covered with a plastic, 



checkered tablecloth. She frowned, her eyes studying him, as she brought over 
his snack. 

He downed the oatmeal raisin cookies and milk, listening to Trigger howl in 
the backyard. Oatmeal raisin wasn’t his favorite, but he was surprised to find that 
he was hungry. As he gobbled them down, Kathryn stood at the doorway, staring 
intently at him, a stern expression on her face. 

“I’m going to take Trigger for a walk,” he announced, wiping the milk 
mustache off his upper lip with the paper napkin she had given him. 

Kathryn shrugged and wrinkled up her face. 

Oh. Right. She can’t hear me, Evan thought. Standing at the kitchen 
window, he pointed to Trigger, then made a walking motion with two fingers. 
Kathryn nodded. 

Whew, he thought. This is going to be hard. 

He waved good-bye and hurried to free Trigger from his backyard prison. 

A few minutes later, Trigger was tugging at the leash, sniffing the flowers 
along the curb as Evan made his way up the block. The other houses on the 
street were about the same size as Kathryn’s, he saw. And they all had small, 
neatly trimmed, square front yards. 

He saw some little kids chasing each other around a birch tree. And he saw 
a middle-aged man in bright orange bathing trunks washing his car with a garden 
hose in his driveway. But he didn’t see any kids his age. 

Trigger barked at a squirrel and tugged the leash out of Evan’s hand. “Hey 
—come back!” Evan called. Trigger, disobedient as always, took off after the 
squirrel. 

The squirrel wisely climbed a tree. But Trigger, his eyesight not what it 
once was, continued the chase. 

Running at full speed, calling the dog’s name, Evan followed him around a 
corner and halfway down the block before Trigger finally realized he had lost the 
race. 

Breathing hard, Evan grabbed the leash handle. “Gotcha,” he said. He gave 
the leash a tug, trying to lead the panting dog back to Kathryn’s street. 

Trigger, sniffing around a dark tree trunk, pulled the other way. Evan was 
about to pick up the stubborn dog when he was startled by a hand grabbing his 
shoulder. 

“Hey—who are you?” a voice demanded. 



5 


Evan spun around to find a girl standing behind him, staring at him with dark 
brown eyes. “Why’d you grab my shoulder like that?” he asked, his heart still 
pounding. 

“To scare you,” she said simply. 

“Yeah. Well...” Evan shrugged. Trigger gave a hard tug at the leash and 
nearly pulled him over. 

The girl laughed. 

She was pretty, he thought. She had short, wavy brown hair, almost black, 
and flashing brown eyes, and a playful, teasing smile. She was wearing an 
oversized yellow T-shirt over black spandex leggings, and bright yellow Nikes. 

“So who are you?” she demanded again. 

She wasn’t the shy type, he decided. “I’m me,” he said, letting Trigger lead 
him around the tree. 

“Did you move into the Winterhalter house?” she asked, following him. 

He shook his head. “No. I’m just visiting.” 

She frowned in disappointment. 

“For a couple of weeks,” Evan added. “I’m staying with my aunt. Actually, 
she’s my great-aunt.” 

“What’s so great about her?” the girl cracked. 

“Nothing,” Evan replied without laughing. “For sure.” 

Trigger sniffed at a bug on a fat brown leaf. 

“Is that your bike?” Evan asked, pointing to the red BMX bike lying on the 
grass behind her. 

“Yeah,” she replied. 

“It’s cool,” he said. “I have one like it.” 

“I like your dog,” she said, eyeing Trigger. “He looks real stupid. I like 
stupid dogs.” 

“Me, too. I guess.” Evan laughed. 

“What’s his name? Does he have a stupid name?” She bent down and tried 
to pet Trigger’s back, but he moved away. 

“His name’s Trigger,” Evan said, and waited for her reaction. 



“Yeah. That’s pretty stupid,” she said thoughtfully. “Especially for a cocker 
spaniel.” 

“Thanks,” Evan said uncertainly. 

Trigger turned to sniff the girl’s hands, his tail wagging furiously, his 
tongue hanging down to the ground. 

“I have a stupid name, too,” the girl admitted. She waited for Evan to ask. 
“What is it?” he said finally. 

“Andrea,” she said. 

“That’s not a stupid name.” 

“I hate it,” she said, pulling a blade of grass off her leggings. “Annndreeea.” 
She stretched the name out in a deep, cultured voice. “It sounds so stuck up, like 
I should be wearing a corduroy jumper with a prim, white blouse, walking a toy 
poodle. So I make everyone call me Andy.” 

“Hi, Andy,” Evan said, petting Trigger. “My name is—” 

“Don’t tell me!” she interrupted, clamping a hot hand over his mouth. 

She certainly isn’t shy, he thought. 

“Let me guess,” she said. “Is it a stupid name, too?” 

“Yeah,” he nodded. “It’s Evan. Evan Stupid.” 

She laughed. “That’s really a stupid name.” 

He felt glad that he made her laugh. She was cheering him up, he realized. 
A lot of the girls back home didn’t appreciate his sense of humor. They thought 
he was silly. 

“What are you doing?” she asked. 

“Walking Trigger. You know. Exploring the neighborhood.” 

“It’s pretty boring,” she said. “Just a lot of houses. Want to go into town? 
It’s only a few blocks away.” She pointed down the street. 

Evan hesitated. He hadn’t told his aunt he was going into town. But, what 
the heck, he thought. She wouldn’t care. 

Besides, what could possibly happen? 



6 


“Okay,” Evan said. “Let’s check out the town.” 

“I have to go to a toy store and look for a present for my cousin,” Andy 
said, hoisting her bike up by the handlebars. 

“How old are you?” Evan asked, tugging Trigger toward the street. 

“Twelve.” 

“Me, too,” he said. “Can I try your bike?” 

She shook her head as she climbed onto the narrow seat. “No, but I’ll let 
you mn alongside.” She laughed. 

“You’re a riot,” he said sarcastically, hurrying to keep up as she began to 
pedal. 

“And you’re stupid,” she called back playfully. 

“Hey, Annnndreeeea —wait up!” he called, stretching the name out to annoy 
her. 

A few blocks later, the houses ended and they entered town, a three-block 
stretch of low two-story shops and offices. Evan saw a small brick post office, a 
barbershop with an old-fashioned barber pole out front, a grocery, a drive- 
through bank, and a hardware store with a large sign in the window proclaiming 
a sale on birdseed. 

“The toy store is in the next block,” Andy said, walking her bike along the 
sidewalk. Evan tugged Trigger’s leash, encouraging him to keep up the pace. 
“Actually there are two toy stores, an old one and a new one. I like the old one 
best.” 

“Let’s check it out,” Evan said, examining the cluttered window display of 
the video store on the corner. 

I wonder if Aunt Kathryn has a VCR, he thought. He quickly dismissed the 
idea. No way.... 

The toy store was in an old clapboard building that hadn’t been painted in 
many years. A small, hand-painted sign in the dust-smeared window proclaimed: 
Wagner’s Novelties & Sundries. There were no toys on display. 

Andy leaned her bike against the front of the building. “Sometimes the 
owner can be a little mean. I don’t know if he’ll let you bring your dog in.” 

“Well, let’s give it a try,” Evan said, pulling open the door. Tugging hard on 



his leash, Trigger led the way into the store. 

Evan found himself in a dark, low-ceilinged, narrow room. It took awhile 
for his eyes to adjust to the dim light. 

Wagner’s looked more like a warehouse than a store. There were floor-to- 
ceiling shelves against both walls, jammed with boxes of toys, and a long 
display counter that ran through the center of the store, leaving narrow aisles that 
even someone as skinny as Evan had to squeeze through. 

At the front of the store, slumped on a tall stool behind an old-fashioned 
wooden cash register, sat a grumpy-looking man with a single tuft of white hair 
in the center of a red, bald head. He had a drooping white mustache that seemed 
to frown at Evan and Andy as they entered. 

“Hi,” Andy said timidly, giving the man a wave. 

He grunted in reply and turned back to the newspaper he was reading. 

Trigger sniffed the low shelves excitedly. Evan looked around at the stacks 
of toys. It appeared from the thick layer of dust that they’d been sitting there for 
a hundred years. Everything seemed tossed together, dolls next to building sets, 
art supplies mixed in with old action figures Evan didn’t even recognize, a toy 
drum set underneath a pile of footballs. 

He and Andy were the only customers in the store. 

“Do they have Nintendo games?” Evan asked her, whispering, afraid to 
break the still silence. 

“I don’t think so,” Andy whispered back. “I’ll ask.” She shouted up to the 
front, “Do you have Nintendo games?” 

It took awhile for the man to answer. He scratched his ear. “Don’t carry 
them,” he grunted finally, sounding annoyed by the interruption. 

Andy and Evan wandered toward the back of the store. “Why do you like 
this place?” Evan whispered, picking up an old cap pistol with a cowboy holster. 

“I just think it’s neat,” Andy replied. “You can find some real treasures 
here. It’s not like other toy stores.” 

“That’s for sure,” Evan said sarcastically. “Hey—look!” He picked up a 
lunchbox with a cowboy dressed in black emblazoned on its side. “Hopalong 
Cassidy,” he read. “Who’s Hopalong Cassidy?” 

“A cowboy with a stupid name,” Andy said, taking the old lunchbox from 
him and examining it. “Look—it’s made of metal, not plastic. Wonder if my 
cousin would like it. He likes stupid names, too.” 

“It’s a pretty weird present,” Evan said. 



“He’s a pretty weird cousin,” Andy cracked. “Hey, look at this.” She set 
down the old lunchbox and picked up an enormous box. “It’s a magic set. 
‘Astound your friends. Perform one hundred amazing tricks,”’ she read. 

“That’s a lot of amazing tricks,” Evan said. 

He wandered farther back into the dimly lit store, Trigger leading the way, 
sniffing furiously. “Hey—” To Evan’s surprise, a narrow doorway led into a 
small back room. 

This room, Evan saw, was even darker and dustier. Stepping inside, he saw 
worn-looking stuffed animals tossed into cartons, games in faded, yellowed 
boxes, baseball gloves with the leather worn thin and cracked. 

Who would want this junk? he thought. 

He was about to leave when something caught his eye. It was a blue can, 
about the size of a can of soup. He picked it up, surprised by how heavy it was. 

Bringing it close to his face to examine it in the dim light, he read the faded 
label: Monster Blood. Below that, in smaller type, it read: Surprising Miracle 
Substance. 

Hey, this looks cool, he thought, turning the can around in his hand. 

He suddenly remembered the ten dollars his mother had stuffed into his 
shirt pocket. 

He turned to see the store owner standing in the doorway, his dark eyes 
wide with anger. “What are you doing back here?” he bellowed. 



7 


Trigger yipped loudly, startled by the man’s booming voice. 

Evan gripped the leash, pulled Trigger close. “Uh... how much is this?” he 
asked, holding up the can of Monster Blood. 

“Not for sale,” the owner said, lowering his voice, his mustache seeming to 
frown unpleasantly with the rest of his face. 

“Huh? It was on the shelf here,” Evan said, pointing. 

“It’s too old,” the man insisted. “Probably no good anymore.” 

“Well, I’ll take it, anyway,” Evan said. “Can I have it for less since it’s so 
old?” 

“What is it?” Andy asked, appearing in the doorway. 

“I don’t know,” Evan told her. “It looks cool. It’s called Monster Blood.” 

“It’s not for sale,” the man insisted. 

Andy pushed past him and took the can from Evan’s hand. “Ooh, I want 
one, too,” she said, turning the can around in her hand. 

“There’s only one,” Evan told her. 

“You sure?” She began searching the shelves. 

“It’s no good, I’m telling you,” the owner insisted, sounding exasperated. 

“I need one, too,” Andy said to Evan. 

“Sorry,” Evan replied, taking the can back. “I saw it first.” 

“I’ll buy it from you,” Andy said. 

“Why don’t you two share it?” the owner suggested. 

“You mean you’ll sell it to us?” Evan asked eagerly. 

The man shrugged and scratched his ear. 

“How much?” Evan asked. 

“You sure you don’t have another one?” Andy demanded, going back to the 
shelf, pushing a pile of stuffed pandas out of her way. “Or maybe two? I could 
keep one and give one to my cousin.” 

“Two dollars, I guess,” the man told Evan. “But I’m telling you, it’s no 
good. It’s too old.” 

“I don’t care,” Evan said, reaching into his shirt pocket for the ten-dollar 


bill. 



“Well, don’t bring it back to me complaining,” the man said grumpily, and 
headed toward the cash register at the front of the store. 

A few minutes later, Evan walked out into the bright daylight carrying the 
blue can. Trigger panted excitedly, wagging his stubby tail, pleased to be out of 
the dark, dusty store. Andy followed them out, an unhappy expression on her 
face. 

“You didn’t buy the lunchbox?” Evan asked. 

“Don’t change the subject,” she snapped. “I’ll pay you five dollars for it.” 
She reached for the can of Monster Blood. 

“No way,” Evan replied. He laughed. “You really like to get your way, don’t 
you!” 

“I’m an only child,” she said. “What can I tell you? I’m spoiled.” 

“Me, too,” Evan said. 

“I have an idea,” Andy said, pulling her bike off the storefront wall. “Let’s 
share it.” 

“Share it?” Evan said, shaking his head. “For sure. I’ll share it the way you 
shared your bike.” 

“You want to ride the bike home? Here.” She shoved it at him. 

“No way,” he said, pushing it back toward her. “I wouldn’t ride your stupid 
bike now. It’s a girl’s bike, anyway.” 

“It is not,” she insisted. “How is it a girl’s bike?” 

Evan ignored the question and, pulling at Trigger’s leash to keep the old 
dog moving, started walking back toward his aunt’s. 

“How is it a girl’s bike?” Andy repeated, walking the bike beside him. 

“Tell you what,” Evan said. “Let’s go back to my aunt’s house and open up 
the can. I’ll let you mess with it for a while.” 

“Gee, swell,” Andy said sarcastically. “You’re a great guy, Evan.” 

“I know,” he said, grinning. 

Kathryn was seated in the big armchair in the living room when Evan and 
Andy arrived. Who is she talking to? he wondered, hearing her voice. She 
seemed to be arguing excitedly with someone. 

Leading Andy into the room, Evan saw that it was just Sarabeth, the black 
cat. As Evan entered, the cat turned and haughtily walked out of the room. 

Kathryn stared at Evan and Andy, a look of surprise on her face. “This is 
Andy,” Evan said, gesturing to his new friend. 

“What have you got there?” Kathryn asked, ignoring Andy and reaching a 



large hand out for the blue can of Monster Blood. 

Evan reluctantly handed it to her. Frowning, she rolled it around in her 
hand, stopping to read the label, moving her lips as she read. She held the can for 
the longest time, seeming to study it carefully, then finally handed it back to 
Evan. 

As Evan took it back and started to his room with Andy, he heard Kathryn 
say something to him in a low whisper. He couldn’t quite hear what she had said. 
It sounded like, “Be careful.” But he wasn’t sure. 

He turned to see Sarabeth staring at him from the doorway, her yellow eyes 
glowing in the dim light. 

“My aunt is completely deaf,” Evan explained to Andy as they climbed the 
stairs. 

“Does that mean you can play your stereo as loud as you want?” Andy 
asked. 

“I don’t think Aunt Kathryn has a stereo,” Evan said. 

“That’s too bad,” Andy said, walking around Evan’s room, pulling back the 
window curtains and looking down on Trigger, huddled unhappily in his pen. 

“Is she really your great-aunt?” Andy asked. “She doesn’t look very old.” 

“It’s the black hair,” Evan replied, setting the can of Monster Blood on the 
desk in the center of the room. “It makes her look young.” 

“Hey—look at all these old books on magic stuff!” Andy exclaimed. “I 
wonder why your aunt has all these.” 

She pulled one of the heavy, old volumes from the shelf and blew away a 
layer of dust from the top. “Maybe your aunt plans to come up here and cast a 
spell on you while you’re sleeping, and turn you into a newt.” 

“Maybe,” Evan replied, grinning. “What is a newt, anyway?” 

Andy shrugged. “Some kind of lizard, I think.” She flipped through the 
yellowed pages of the old book. “I thought you said there was nothing to do 
here,” she told Evan. “You could read all these cool books.” 

“Thrills and chills,” Evan said sarcastically. 

Replacing the book on the shelf, Andy came over to the desk and stood next 
to Evan, her eyes on the can of Monster Blood. “Open it up. It’s so old. It’s 
probably all disgusting and rotten.” 

“I hope so,” Evan said. He picked up the can and studied it. “No 
instructions.” 

“Just pull the top off,” she said impatiently. 



He tugged at it. It wouldn’t budge. 

“Maybe you need a can opener or something,” she said. 

“Very helpful,” he muttered, studying the label again. “Look at this. No 
instructions. No ingredients. Nothing.” 

“Of course not. It’s Monster Blood!” she exclaimed, imitating Count 
Dracula. She grabbed Evan’s neck and pretended to strangle him. 

He laughed. “Stop! You’re not helping.” 

He slammed the can down on the desktop—and the lid popped off. 

“Hey—look!” he cried. 

She let go of his neck, and they both peered inside the can.

The substance inside the can was bright green. It shimmered like Jell-0 in the 
light from the ceiling fixture. 

“Touch it,” Andy said. 

But before Evan had a chance, she reached a finger in and poked it. “It’s 
cold,” she said. “Touch it. It’s really cold.” 

Evan poked it with his finger. It was cold, thicker than Jell-O, heavier. 

He pushed his finger beneath the surface. When he pulled his finger out, it 
made a loud sucking noise. 

“Gross,” Andy said. 

Evan shrugged. “I’ve seen worse.” 

“I’ll bet it glows in the dark,” Andy said, hurrying over to the light switch 
by the door. “It looks like the green that glows in the dark.” 

She turned off the ceiling light, but late afternoon sunlight still poured in 
through the window curtains. “Try the closet,” she instructed excitedly. 

Evan carried the can into the closet. Andy followed and closed the door. 
“Yuck. Mothballs,” she cried. “I can’t breathe.” 

The Monster Blood definitely glowed in the dark. A circular ray of green 
light seemed to shine from the can. 

“Wow. That’s way cool,” Andy said, holding her nose to keep out the 
pungent aroma of the mothballs. 

“I’ve had other stuff that did this,” Evan said, more than a little 
disappointed. “It was called Alien Stuff or Yucky Glop, something like that.” 

“Well, if you don’t want it, I’ll take it,” Andy replied. 

“I didn’t say I didn’t want it,” Evan said quickly. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Andy begged. 

Evan pushed open the door and they rushed out of the closet, slamming the 
door shut behind them. Both of them sucked in fresh air for a few seconds. 

“Whew, I hate that smell!” Evan declared. He looked around to see that 
Andy had taken a handful of Monster Blood from the can. 

She squeezed it in her palm. “It feels even colder outside the can,” she said, 
grinning at him. “Look. When you squeeze it flat, it pops right back.” 

“Yeah. It probably bounces, too,” Evan said, unimpressed. “Try bouncing it 



against the floor. All those things bounce like rubber.” 

Andy rolled the glob of Monster Blood into a ball and dropped it to the 
floor. It bounced back up into her hand. She bounced it a little harder. This time 
it rebounded against the wall and went flying out the bedroom door. 

“It bounces really well,” she said, chasing it out into the hall. “Let’s see if it 
stretches.” She grabbed it with both hands and pulled, stretching it into a long 
string. “Yep. It stretches, too.” 

“Big deal,” Evan said. “The stuff I had before bounced and stretched really 
well, too. I thought this stuff was going to be different.” 

“It stays cold, even after it’s been in your hand,” Andy said, returning to the 
room. 

Evan glanced at the wall and noticed a dark, round stain by the floorboard. 
“Uh-oh. Look, Andy. That stuff stains.” 

“Let’s take it outside and toss it around,” she suggested. 

“Okay,” he agreed. “We’ll go out back. That way, Trigger won’t be so 
lonely.” 

Evan held out the can, and Andy replaced the ball of Monster Blood. Then 
they headed downstairs and out to the backyard, where they were greeted by 
Trigger, who acted as if they’d been away for at least twenty years. 

The dog finally calmed down, and sat down in the shade of a tree, panting 
noisily. “Good boy,” Evan said softly. “Take it easy. Take it easy, old fella.” 

Andy reached into the can and pulled out a green glob. Then Evan did the 
same. They rolled the stuff in their hands until they had two ball-shaped globs. 
Then they began to play catch with them. 

“It’s amazing how they don’t lose their shape,” Andy said, tossing a green 
ball high in the air. 

Evan shielded his eyes from the late afternoon sun and caught the ball with 
one hand. “All this stuff is the same,” he said. “It isn’t so special.” 

“Well, I think it’s cool,” Andy said defensively. 

Evan’s next toss was too high. The green ball of gunk sailed over Andy’s 
outstretched hands. 

“Whoa!” Andy cried. 

“Sorry,” Evan called. 

They both stared as the ball bounced once, twice, then landed right in front 
of Trigger. 

Startled, the dog jumped to his feet and lowered his nose to sniff it. 



“No, boy!” Evan called. “Leave it alone. Leave it alone, boy!” 

As disobedient as ever, Trigger lowered his head and licked the glowing 
green ball. 

“No, boy! Drop! Drop!” Evan called, alarmed. 

He and Andy both lunged toward the dog. 

But they were too slow. 

Trigger picked up the ball of Monster Blood in his teeth and began chewing 
it. 

“No, Trigger!” Evan shouted. “Don’t swallow it. Don’t swallow!” 

Trigger swallowed it. 

“Oh, no!” Andy cried, balling her hands into fists at her sides. “Now there 
isn’t enough left for us to share!” 

But that wasn’t what was troubling Evan. He bent down and pried apart the 
dog’s jaws. The green blob was gone. Swallowed. 

“Stupid dog,” Evan said softly, releasing the dog’s mouth. 

He shook his head as troubling thoughts poured into his mind. 

What if the stuff makes Trigger sick? Evan wondered. 

What if the stuff is poison?

“Are we going to bake that pie today?” Evan asked his aunt, writing the question 
on a pad of lined yellow paper he had found on the desk in his room. 

Kathryn read the question while adjusting her black ponytail. Her face was 
as white as cake flour in the morning sunlight filtering through the kitchen 
window. 

“Pie? What pie?” she replied coldly. 

Evan’s mouth dropped open. He decided not to remind her. 

“Go play with your friends,” Kathryn said, still coldly, petting Sarabeth’s 
head as the black cat walked by the breakfast table. “Why do you want to stay 
inside with an old witch?” 

It was three days later. Evan had tried to be friendly with his aunt. But the 
more he tried, the colder she had become. 

She’s mean. She’s really mean, he thought, as he ate the last spoonful of 
cereal from his bowl of shredded wheat. That was the only cereal she had. Evan 
struggled to choke it down every morning. Even with milk, the cereal was so dry 
and she wouldn’t even let him put sugar on it. 

“Looks like it might rain,” Kathryn said, and took a long sip of the strong 
tea she had brewed. Her teeth clicked noisily as she drank. 

Evan turned his eyes to the bright sunlight outside the window. What made 
her think it was going to rain? 

He glanced back at her, seated across from him at the small kitchen table. 
For the first time, he noticed the pendant around her neck. It was cream-colored 
and sort of bone-shaped. 

It is a bone, Evan decided. 

He stared hard at it, trying to decide if it was a real bone, from some animal 
maybe, or a bone carved out of ivory. Catching his stare, Kathryn reached up 
with a large hand and tucked the pendant inside her blouse. 

“Go see your girlfriend. She’s a pretty one,” Kathryn said. She took another 
long sip of tea, again clicking her teeth as she swallowed. 

Yes. I’ve got to get out of here, Evan thought. He pushed his chair back, 
stood up, and carried his bowl to the sink. 

I can’t take much more of this, Evan thought miserably. She hates me. She 



really does. 

He hurried up the stairs to his room, where he brushed his curly red hair. 
Staring into the mirror, he thought of the call he had received from his mother 
the night before. 

She had called right after dinner, and he could tell immediately from her 
voice that things weren’t going well down in Atlanta. 

“How’s it going, Mom?” he had asked, so happy to hear her voice, even 
though she was nearly a thousand miles away. 

“Slowly,” his mother had replied hesitantly. 

“What do you mean? How’s Dad? Did you find a house?” The questions 
seemed to pour out of him like air escaping a balloon. 

“Whoa. Slow down,” Mrs. Ross had replied. She sounded tired. “We’re 
both fine, but it’s taking a little longer to find a house than we thought. We just 
haven’t found anything we like.” 

“Does that mean—” Evan started. 

“We found one really nice house, very big, very pretty,” his mother 
interrupted. “But the school you’d go to wasn’t very good.” 

“Oh, that’s okay. I don’t have to go to school,” Evan joked. 

He could hear his father saying something in the background. His mother 
covered the receiver to reply. 

“When are you coming to pick me up?” Evan asked eagerly. 

It took his mother awhile to answer. “Well... that’s the problem,” she said 
finally. “We may need a few more days down here than we thought. How’s it 
going up there, Evan? Are you okay?” 

Hearing the bad news that he’d have to stay even longer with Kathryn had 
made Evan feel like screaming and kicking the wall. But he didn’t want to upset 
his mother. He told her he was fine and that he’d made a new friend. 

His father had taken the phone and offered a few encouraging words. “Hang 
in there,” he had said just before ending the conversation. 

I’m hanging in, Evan had thought glumly. 

But hearing his parents’ voices had made him even more homesick. 

Now it was the next morning. Putting down his hairbrush, he examined 
himself quickly in his dresser mirror. He was wearing denim cutoffs and a red 
Gap T-shirt. 

Downstairs, he hurried through the kitchen, where Kathryn appeared to be 
arguing with Sarabeth, ran out the back door, then jogged to the backyard to get 



Trigger. “Hey, Trigger!” 

But the dog was asleep, lying on his side in the center of his run, gently 
snoring. 

“Don’t you want to go to Andy’s house?” Evan asked quietly. 

Trigger stirred, but didn’t open his eyes. 

“Okay. See you later,” Evan said. He made sure Trigger’s water bowl was 
filled, then headed to the front of the house. 

He was halfway down the next block, walking slowly, thinking about his 
parents so far away in Atlanta, when a boy’s voice called, “Hey—you!” And two 
boys stepped onto the sidewalk in front of him, blocking his way. 

Startled, Evan stared from one boy to the other. They were twins. Identical 
twins. Both were big, beefy guys, with short, white-blond hair and round, red 
faces. They were both wearing dark T-shirts with the names of heavy-metal 
bands on the front, baggy shorts, and high-top sneakers, untied, without socks. 
Evan guessed they were about fourteen or fifteen. 

“Who are you?” one of them asked menacingly, narrowing his pale gray 
eyes, trying to act tough. Both twins moved closer, forcing Evan to take a big 
step back. 

These guys are twice my size, Evan realized, feeling a wave of fear sweep 
over him. 

Are they just acting tough? Or do they really mean to give me trouble? 

“I—I’m staying with my aunt,” he stammered, shoving his hands into his 
pockets and taking another step back. 

The twins flashed each other quick grins. “You can’t walk on this block,” 
one of them said, hovering over Evan. 

“Yeah. You’re not a resident,” the other added. 

“That’s a big word,” Evan cracked, then immediately wished he hadn’t said 
it. 

Why can’t I ever keep my big mouth shut? he asked himself. His eyes 
surveyed the neighborhood, searching for someone who might come to his aid in 
case the twins decided to get rough. 

But there was no one in sight. Front doors were closed. Yards were empty. 
Way down the block, he could see a mailman, heading the other way, too far 
away to shout to. 

No one around. No one to help him. 

And the two boys, their faces set, their eyes still menacing, began to move 



in on him.

“Where do you think you’re going?” one of the twins asked. His hands were 
balled into fists at his sides. He stepped closer until he was just an inch or two 
from Evan, forcing Evan to take a few steps back. 

“To see a friend,” Evan replied uncertainly. Maybe these guys were just 
bluffing. 

“Not allowed,” the twin said quickly, grinning at his brother. 

They both snickered and moved toward Evan, forcing him to back off the 
curb onto the street. 

“You’re not a resident,” the other one repeated. He narrowed his eyes, 
trying to look tough. 

“Hey, give me a break, guys,” Evan said. He tried moving to the side, 
walking on the street, to get around them. But they both moved quickly to keep 
him from getting away. 

“Maybe you could pay a toll,” one of them said. 

“Yeah,” the other one quickly chimed in. “You could pay the nonresident 
toll. You know, to get temporary permission for walking on this block.” 

“I don’t have any money,” Evan said, feeling his fear grow. 

He suddenly remembered he had eight dollars in his pocket. Were they 
going to rob him? Would they beat him up and then rob him? 

“You have to pay the toll,” one of them said, leering at him. “Let’s just see 
what you’ve got.” 

They both moved quickly forward, making a grab for him. 

He backed away. His legs suddenly felt heavy from fear. 

Suddenly a voice cried out from down the sidewalk. “Hey—what’s going 

on?” 

Evan raised his eyes past the two hulking boys to see Andy speeding 
toward them on her bike along the curb. “Evan—hi!” she called. 

The twins turned away from Evan to greet the new arrival. “Hi, Andy,” one 
of them said in a mocking tone. 

“How’s it going, Andy?” the other one asked, imitating his brother. 

Andy braked her bike and dropped both feet to the ground. She was 
wearing bright pink shorts and a yellow sleeveless undershirt top. Her face was 



red, her forehead beaded with perspiration from pedaling so hard. 

“You two,” she said, and made an unpleasant face. “Rick and Tony.” She 
turned to Evan. “Were they getting on your case?” 

“Well...” Evan started hesitantly. 

“We were welcoming him to the neighborhood,” the one named Rick said, 
grinning at his brother. 

Tony started to add something, but Andy interrupted. “Well, leave him 
alone.” 

“Are you his mother ?” Tony asked, snickering. He turned to Evan and made 
goo-goo baby noises. 

“We’ll leave him alone,” Rick said, stepping toward Andy. “We’ll borrow 
your bike and leave him alone.” 

“No way,” Andy said heatedly. 

But before Andy could move, Rick grabbed the handlebars. “Let go!” Andy 
cried, trying to pull the bike from his grasp. 

Rick held tight. Tony shoved Andy hard. 

She lost her balance and fell, and the bike toppled over on top of her. 

“Ohhh.” 

Andy uttered a low cry as she hit her head on the concrete curb. She lay 
sprawled on the curb, her hands flailing, the bike on top of her. 

Before she could get up, Tony reached down and grabbed the bike away. He 
swung his legs over the seat and began to pedal furiously. “Wait up!” his brother 
called, laughing as he ran alongside. 

In seconds, the twins had disappeared around the corner with Andy’s bike. 

“Andy—are you okay?” Evan cried, hurrying to the curb. “Are you okay?” 

He grabbed Andy’s hand and pulled her to her feet. She stood up groggily, 
mbbing the back of her head. “I hate those creeps,” she said. She brushed the dirt 
and grass off her shorts and legs. “Ow. That hurt.” 

“Who are they?” Evan asked. 

“The Beymer twins,” she answered, making a disgusted face. “Real heavy- 
duty dudes,” she added sarcastically. She checked her leg to see if it was cut. It 
was just scraped. “They think they’re so cool, but they’re total creeps.” 

“What about your bike? Should we call the police or something?” Evan 
asked. 

“No need,” she said quietly, brushing back her dark hair. “I’ll get it back. 
They’ve done this before. They’ll leave it somewhere when they’re finished.” 



“But shouldn’t we—” Evan started. 

“They just run wild,” Andy interrupted. “There’s no one home to check up 
on them. They live with their grandmother, but she’s never around. Did they give 
you a hard time?” 

Evan nodded. “I was afraid I was going to have to pound them,” he joked. 

Andy didn’t laugh. “I’d like to pound them,” she said angrily. “Just once. 
I’d like to pay them back. They pick on all the kids in the neighborhood. They 
think they can do whatever they want because they’re so big, and because there 
are two of them.” 

“Your knee is cut,” Evan said, pointing. 

“I’d better go home and clean it up,” she replied, rolling her eyes 
disgustedly. “See you later, okay? I have to go somewhere this afternoon, but 
maybe we can do something tomorrow.” 

She headed back to her house, rubbing the back of her head. 

Evan returned to Kathryn’s, walking slowly, thinking about the Beymer 
twins, daydreaming about fighting them, imagining himself beating them to a 
pulp in a fight as Andy watched, cheering him on. 

Kathryn was dusting the front room as Evan entered. She didn’t look up. He 
headed quickly up the stairs to his room. 

Now what am I going to do? he wondered, pacing back and forth. The blue 
container of Monster Blood caught his eye. He walked over to the bookshelf and 
picked up the can from the middle shelf. 

He pulled off the lid. The can was nearly full. 

I guess Trigger didn’t eat that much, he thought, feeling a little relieved. 

Trigger! 

He’d forgotten all about him. The poor dog must be hungry. 

Putting down the Monster Blood, Evan bombed down the stairs, leaning 
against the banister and taking the stairs three at a time. Then, running full-out, 
he practically flew to the dog run at the back of the yard. 

“Trigger! Hey—Trigger!” he called. 

Halfway across the backyard, Evan could see that something was wrong. 

Trigger’s eyes were bulging. His mouth was wide open, his tongue flailing 
rapidly from side to side, white spittle running down his chin hair onto the 
ground. 

“Trigger!” 

The dog was gasping hoarsely, each breath a desperate, difficult struggle. 



He’s choking! Evan realized. 

As Evan reached the dog run, Trigger’s eyes rolled back, and the dog’s legs 
collapsed under him, his stomach still heaving, the air filled with his loud, 
hideous gasps. 



11 


“Trigger—no!” 

Evan dived to his knees beside the dog and began to tug at Trigger’s collar. 
The collar, Evan saw, had become way too tight. 

The dog’s chest heaved. Thick white spittle flowed from his open mouth. 

“Hold on, boy. Hold on!” Evan cried. 

The dog’s eyes rolled wildly in his head. He didn’t seem to see or hear 
Evan. 

“Hold on, fella! Just hold on!” 

The collar wouldn’t budge. It was buried tightly under the dog’s fur. 

His hands shaking, Evan struggled to pull the collar over Trigger’s head. 

Come loose, come loose, come loose, he begged. 

Yes! 

Trigger uttered a pained whimper as Evan finally managed to pull the collar 
away. 

“Trigger—it’s off! Are you okay?” 

Still panting hard, the dog jumped immediately to his feet. He licked Evan’s 
face appreciatively, covering Evan’s cheek with his thick saliva, whimpering as 
if he understood that Evan had just saved his life. 

“Easy, boy! Easy, fella!” Evan repeated, but the dog continued to lick him 
gratefully. 

Evan hugged the excited dog. This had been a close call, he knew. If he 
hadn’t come along just then... 

Well, he didn’t want to think about it. 

When Trigger finally calmed down, Evan examined the collar. “What made 
this collar shrink like that, boy?” he asked Trigger. 

The dog had walked over to the fence and was frantically slurping water 
from his bowl. 

This is plain weird, Evan thought. The collar couldn’t have shrunk. It’s 
made of leather. There was no reason for it to shrink. 

Then why did it suddenly start choking Trigger? 

Evan turned to Trigger, studying him as the dog lapped greedily at the 



water, breathing hard. He turned and glanced back at Evan for a second, then 
returned to his frantic water slurping. 

He’s bigger, Evan decided. 

He’s definitely bigger. 

But Trigger was twelve years old, eighty-four in human years. Older than 
Aunt Kathryn. 

Trigger was too old for a late growth spurt. 

It must be my eyes, Evan decided, tossing the collar to the ground. This 
place must be making me see things. 

Kathryn was at the kitchen door, calling Evan to lunch. He poured out a 
bowl of dry food, shouted good-bye to Trigger, who didn’t look up from the 
water dish, and hurried to the house. 

The next morning, an overcast morning with an autumn chill in the air, Evan 
made his way to Andy’s house. He found her huddled under a big maple tree in 
the neighbor’s front yard. “What’s going on?” he called. 

Then he saw that she was leaning over something, her hands working 
quickly. “Come help me!” she cried, not looking up. 

Evan came jogging over. “Whoa!” he cried out when he saw that Andy was 
struggling to free a calico cat that had been tied to the tree trunk. 

The cat screeched and swiped its paw at Andy. Andy dodged the claws and 
continued to pull at the big knots in the rope. 

“The Beymer twins did this. I know it,” she said loudly, over the shrilly 
protesting cat. “This poor cat was probably tied up here all night.” 

The cat, in a panic, shrieked with amazingly human-sounding cries. 

“Stand still, cat,” Evan said as the terrified cat swiped its claws at Andy 
again. “Can I help?” 

“No. I’ve almost got it,” she replied, tugging at the knot. “I’d like to tie 
Rick and Tony to this tree.” 

“Poor, frightened cat,” Evan said quietly. 

“There,” Andy said triumphantly, pulling the rope loose. 

The cat gave one last cry of protest, its tail standing straight up. Then it 
darted away, running at full speed, and disappeared under a tall hedge without 
looking back. 

“Not very polite,” Evan muttered. 

Andy stood up and sighed. She was wearing faded denim jeans and a pale 



green, oversized T-shirt that came down nearly to her knees. She lifted the 
bottom of the shirt to examine a hole the cat had managed to snag in it. 

“I can’t believe those two creeps,” she said, shaking her head. 

“Maybe we should call the police or the ASPCA or something,” Evan 
suggested. 

“The twins would just deny it,” Andy said glumly, shaking her head. Then 
she added, “And the cat’s not a very good witness.” 

They both laughed. 

Evan led the way back to his aunt’s house. All the way back, they talked 
about how they’d like to teach the Beymer twins a lesson. But neither of them 
had any good ideas. 

They found Kathryn concentrating on a jigsaw puzzle at the dining room 
table. 

She looked up when they entered, squinting at them. “You like jigsaw 
puzzles? I like to keep my mind active, you know. That’s why I like puzzles. 
Your mind can get flabby when you get to be my age. A hundred and twelve.” 

She slapped the table gleefully at her own wit. Evan and Andy both flashed 
her agreeable smiles. Then she returned to her puzzle without waiting for a reply. 

“She’s going to drive me bananas!” Evan exclaimed. 

“Evan—she’ll hear you!” Andy protested, cupping a hand over his mouth. 

“I told you, she’s completely deaf. She can’t hear me. She doesn’t want to 
hear anyone. She hates everyone.” 

“I think she’s sweet,” Andy said. “Why does she wear a bone around her 
neck?” 

“Probably thinks it’s cool,” Evan cracked. 

“Let’s go upstairs,” Andy urged, pushing him toward the stairs. “I still feel 
weird talking about your aunt right in front of her.” 

“You’re a crazy old coot,” Evan called to Kathryn, a big smile on his face. 

Kathryn looked up from her puzzle pieces to cast a cold stare his way. 

“She heard you!” Andy cried, horrified. 

“Don’t be dumb,” Evan said, and started up the stairs, nearly tripping over 
Sarabeth. 

Up in Evan’s room, Andy paced uncomfortably. “What do you want to do?” 

“Well... we could read some of these great books,” Evan said sarcastically, 
pointing to the dusty old books that lined the walls. “Maybe find a spell to cast 
on the Beymer twins. You know. Turn them into newts.” 



“Forget about newts,” Andy said dryly. “Hey—where’s the Monster 
Blood?” Before Evan could answer, she spotted it on one of the shelves. 

They raced across the room for it. Andy got there first and grabbed the can. 
“Evan—look,” she said, her eyes growing wide with surprise. “What’s going 
on?” 

She held up the can. The green gunk had pushed up the lid and was flowing 
up out of the can. 



12 


“Huh? Did the top break or something?” Evan asked. 

He took the can from her and examined it. Sure enough, the lid had popped 
off. The gooey green substance was pushing up out of the can. 

Evan pulled out a handful of the green gunk. “Weird,” he exclaimed. “It’s 
expanding,” he said, squeezing it in his hand. “It’s definitely growing.” 

“I guess so!” Andy exclaimed. “It grew right out of the can!” 

“Hey—it’s not cold anymore,” Evan said. He balled it up and tossed it to 
Andy. 

“It’s really warm,” she agreed. “Weird!” 

She tried to toss it back to him, but it stuck to her palm. “It’s getting sticky,” 
she reported. “Are you sure this is the same stuff?” 

“Of course,” Evan replied. 

“But it wasn’t sticky before, remember?” she said. 

He pulled another warm hunk of it from the can. “I guess it just changes 
after the can has been opened.” 

He squeezed the stuff into a ball shape and tossed it to the floor. “Look—it 
stuck to the floor. It didn’t bounce.” 

“Weird!” Andy repeated. 

“Maybe I should throw it in the trash,” Evan said, prying the sticky glob 
from the floor. “I mean, what good is it if it doesn’t bounce?” 

“Hey—no way,” Andy said. “We’ve got to see what it does next.” 

A soft mewing sound made them both turn toward the door. 

Evan was surprised to see Sarabeth standing there, her head cocked, her 
yellow eyes staring at him. 

Or was she staring at the glob of Monster Blood in his hand? 

“That cat looks so intelligent,” Andy said. 

“It’s as stupid as every other cat,” Evan muttered. “Look. She wants to play 
ball with the Monster Blood.” 

“Sorry, cat,” Andy said. “It doesn’t bounce.” 

As if she understood, Sarabeth mewed unhappily, turned, and padded 
silently from the room. 



“Now where am I going to keep this stuff?” Evan asked. “It’s too big for its 

can.” 

“Here. How about this?” Andy asked. She reached down to a low shelf and 
came up with an empty coffee can. 

“Yeah. Okay.” Evan tossed his hunk into the coffee can. 

Andy squeezed hers into a flat pancake. “Look. It isn’t glowing the way it 
used to, either,” she said, holding the pancake up for Evan to see. “But it sure is 
warm. Almost hot.” 

“It’s alivel” Evan screamed playfully. “Run for your life! It’s a/zve!” 

Andy laughed and began to chase Evan, menacing him with the flat, green 
pancake. “Come get your Monster Blood! Come and get it!” 

He dodged away, then grabbed it from her hand. He squeezed it together, 
balling it up in one hand, then tossed it into the coffee can. 

They both peered into the can. The green substance filled it up a little more 
than halfway. 

“Go ahead. Taste it,” Andy urged, poking the can in his face. “I dare you.” 

“Huh? No way. I double-dare you,” Evan said, pushing the coffee can back 
to her. 

“Double-darers have to go first,” Andy insisted, grinning. “Go ahead. Taste 
it.” 

Evan made a disgusted face and shook his head. Then he grabbed a big 
hunk of it and heaved it at Andy. Laughing, she picked it up off the carpet and 
tossed it at his face. She threw high, and the green glob stuck to the wall. 

Evan reached for another hunk. 

They had a messy, hilarious Monster Blood battle till dinnertime. Then, as 
they tried to clean up, they both heard Trigger through the open window. He was 
barking loudly out in his pen. 

Evan reached the window first. The sky was still gray and overcast. Trigger 
was leaning on the wooden fence, standing on his hind legs, barking his head off. 

“Whoa, Trigger,” Evan called, “chill out!” 

“Hey—what’s with Trigger?” Andy asked. “Is your dog still growing? He 
looks so big!” 

Evan’s mouth dropped open and he uttered a silent gasp, realizing that 
Andy was right. 

Trigger had nearly doubled in size. 



13 


“Trigger—come back! Come backl” 

The big dog continued to run, its giant paws thundering against the 
concrete. 

“Come back!” Evan screamed, running with long, desperate strides, his 
heart thudding, his legs aching with each step as he tried to catch up with the 
galloping dog. 

The night was dark and starless. The street glistened as if it had recently 
rained. 

Trigger’s paws hit the pavement, each step a loud thunderclap that seemed 
to echo forever. His giant ears flapped like wings, twin pennants caught on the 
wind. His big head bobbed up and down, but he didn’t look back. 

“Trigger! Trigger!” 

Evan’s voice seemed muffled by the gusting wind, pushed back in his face. 
He tried shouting louder, but no sound came out at all. 

He knew he had to stop the dog from running away. He had to catch the dog 
and then get help. 

Trigger was growing so fast, completely out of control. He was already the 
size of a pony, and getting larger by the minute. 

“Trigger! Trigger! Stop, boy!” 

Trigger didn’t seem to hear him. Evan’s voice didn’t seem to carry beyond 
the gusting, swirling wind. 

And still Evan ran, his chest pounding, every muscle aching. And as he ran, 
he suddenly realized there were others running, too. 

Two large figures in front of the stampeding dog. 

Two large figures Evan recognized as they fled at full speed, trying to get 
away from the onrushing animal. 

The Beymer twins. Rick and Tony. 

Trigger was chasing them, Evan suddenly realized. 

The boys turned a corner, onto an even darker street. Trigger followed, 
bounding after them. Evan continued to run, bringing up the rear of this dark, 
mysterious parade. 

All was silent now, except for the steady, rhythmic thunder of Trigger’s 



enormous padded paws. 

Except for the clapclapclap of the Beymer twins’ sneakers as they darted 
along the glistening pavement. 

Except for the gasp of Evan’s breathing as he struggled to keep up. 

Suddenly, as Evan watched in horror, the dog raised up on his hind legs. He 
tilted his head to the sky and let out an ear-piercing howl. Not the howl of a dog. 
A creature howl. 

And then Trigger’s features began to transform. His forehead burst forward 
and enlarged. His eyes grew wide and round before sinking under the protruding 
forehead. Fangs slid from his gaping mouth, and he uttered another howl to the 
sky, louder and more chilling than the first. 

“He’s a monster! A monster!” Evan cried. 

And woke up. 

Woke up from his frightening dream. 

And realized he was in bed, in the study upstairs in Kathryn’s house. 

It had all been a dream, a frightening, wild chase of a dream. 

A harmless dream. Except that something still wasn’t right. 

The bed. It felt so uncomfortable. So cramped. 

Evan sat up, alert, wide awake now. 

And stared down at his giant feet. His giant hands. And realized how tiny 
the bed seemed beneath him. 

Because he was a giant now. 

Because he had grown so huge, so monstrously huge. 

And when he saw how big he had become, he opened his mouth wide and 
began to scream. 



14 


His screams woke him up. 

This time he really woke up. 

And realized that, the first time, he had only dreamed that he was awake. 
Had only dreamed that he had become a giant. 

Dreams upon dreams. 

Was he really awake now? 

He sat up, blinked, rubbed his eyes, struggled to focus. 

Dripping with sweat. 

His blankets tossed to the floor. 

His pajamas damp, clinging to his prickly skin. 

Nothing seemed familiar. It took awhile to shake off the dream, to 
remember where he was. That he was in his room at Kathryn’s. Awake now. His 
normal size. 

Tossed by the wind, the curtains brushed over him, then were noisily 
sucked out the window. 

Evan sat up and, still feeling shaky, peered out the window. 

Wisps of gray clouds floated over a pale half-moon. Trees tossed and 
whispered in the cool night wind. 

Only a dream. 

A frightening dream. A dream on top of a dream. 

He could see Trigger sound asleep, curled up on himself, pressed against 
the fence wall. 

Trigger wasn’t a monster. But he was definitely bigger, Evan saw. 

Maybe there’s something wrong with him. The troubling thought pushed its 
way into Evan’s mind as he stared down at the sleeping dog. 

Maybe it’s glands or something. 

Maybe he’s eating too much. Or maybe... 

Evan yawned. He realized he was too sleepy to think clearly. Maybe the 
next morning he’d see if there was a vet in town. 

Yawning again, he started to settle back into bed. But something caught his 


eye. 



The coffee can on the bookshelf. The can where he had stored the Monster 
Blood. 

“Hey—” he cried aloud. 

The green gunk was bubbling, quivering up over the top of the coffee can. 



15 


“Your dog seems to be quite healthy for his age.” Dr. Forrest scratched Trigger 
gently under the chin. “Look at all the white hairs,” he said, bringing his face 
down close to the dog’s. “You’re a good old dog, aren’t you?” 

Trigger licked the doctor’s hand appreciatively. 

Dr. Forrest grinned, pushing his black eyeglasses up on his narrow nose, the 
ceiling light reflecting off his shiny forehead. He wiped his hand on the front of 
his white lab coat. 

Evan and Andy stood across from Trigger in the small, brightly lit office. 
They had both been tense during the long examination the vet had given the dog. 
But now, hearing the doctor’s verdict, they had relaxed expressions on their 
faces. 

“So you think it’s just a late growth spurt?” Evan repeated. 

Dr. Forrest nodded, returning to his desk in the corner. “Highly unusual,” he 
said softly, leaning over the desk to write a note on a pad. “Highly unusual. 
We’ll get a lab report in three or four days. It may tell us more. But the dog 
seems very healthy to me. I really wouldn’t be alarmed.” 

“But do cocker spaniels usually get this big?” Evan asked, leaning down to 
scratch Trigger under the chin, the leash looped loosely in his hand. 

Trigger wanted to leave. He pulled toward the door. Evan stood up and 
tugged hard at the leash to keep the dog in place. It took ah of his strength. 
Trigger was not only bigger; he was much stronger than he had been a few days 
before. 

“No. Not usually,” the vet replied. “That’s why I took the hormone tests and 
the blood and glandular samples. Maybe the lab will have an answer for us.” 

He finished writing and tore the sheet off the pad. “Here,” he said, handing 
the paper to Evan. “I wrote down the name of a good dog food. Put Trigger on 
this, and see that he cuts down on his between-meal snacks.” He chuckled at his 
own joke. 

Evan thanked the doctor and allowed Trigger to pull him out of the office. 
Andy jogged after them. In the waiting room outside, a tiny Chihuahua cowered 
behind the couch, whimpering at the sight of the big cocker spaniel. 

“I’m glad to be out of there,” Evan exclaimed as they stepped out to the 



sidewalk. 

“Trigger got a very good report,” Andy said reassuringly, petting Trigger’s 
head. “Hey, look—his head is wider than my hand!” 

“He’s nearly as big as a sheepdog!” Evan said miserably. “And Dr. Forrest 
says he’s perfectly okay.” 

“Don’t exaggerate,” Andy scolded. She glanced at her watch. “Oh, no! I 
don’t believe it. Late for my piano lesson. Again! Mom’ll kill me!” 

She waved good-bye, turned, and ran full speed down the sidewalk, nearly 
colliding with an elderly couple coming slowly out of the small grocery store on 
the corner. 

“Let’s go, boy,” Evan said, thinking about what Dr. Forrest had said. 
Tugging the leash, he headed out of the small, three-block town. Despite the 
vet’s assurances, Evan was still plenty worried about Trigger. 

He stopped outside the grocery. “Maybe an ice cream pop will help cheer 
me up.” He tied Trigger’s leash to the red fire hydrant across from the grocery’s 
door. “Stay,” he instructed. 

Trigger, ignoring Evan, struggled to pull free. 

“I’ll only be a second,” Evan said, and hurried into the store. 

There were three or four people in the store, and it took a bit longer than 
Evan had expected. When he returned to the sidewalk ten minutes later, he 
discovered the Beymer twins busily untying Trigger. 

“Hey—let go!” he cried angrily. 

They both turned toward him, identical grins on their beefy faces. “Look 
what we found,” one of them teased. The other one successfully untied the leash 
from the hydrant. 

“Hand me that,” Evan insisted, holding his chocolate ice cream bar in one 
hand, reaching for the leash handle with the other. 

The Beymer twin held the leash handle out to Evan—then quickly snapped 
it back out of his reach. “Gotcha!” 

The brothers laughed gleefully and slapped each other a high five. 

“Stop fooling around,” Evan insisted. “Hand me the leash.” 

“Finders, keepers,” one of them said. “Isn’t that right, Tony?” 

“Yeah,” Tony replied, grinning. “It’s an ugly dog. But it’s our ugly dog 
now.” 

“Get your own dog, wimp,” Rick said nastily. He stepped forward and 
punched the ice cream bar out of Evan’s hand. It landed on the sidewalk with a 



plop. 

The brothers started to laugh, but their laughter was cut short as Trigger 
suddenly uttered a low, warning growl. Pulling back his lips, he bared his teeth, 
and his growl became a snarl. 

“Hey—” Rick cried, dropping the leash. 

With a loud, angry roar, Trigger reared up and pounced on Rick, forcing 
him to stagger backward to the curb. 

Tony had already started to run, his sneakers pounding the pavement noisily 
as he headed at full speed past the vet’s office, past the post office, and kept 
going. 

“Wait up! Hey, Tony—wait up!” Rick stumbled, stood up, and took off after 
his brother. 

Evan grabbed for Trigger’s leash—and missed. 

“Trigger—whoa! Stop!” 

The dog took off after the fleeing twins, barking angrily, his enormous paws 
thudding loudly on the pavement, picking up speed as he closed in on them. 

No, Evan thought, finding himself frozen there on the corner in front of the 
grocery. 

No. No. No. 

This can’t be happening! 

It’s my dream. 

Is it coming true? 

Evan shuddered, remembering the rest of his dream, remembering how he, 
too, grew until he was twice his size. 

Would that part of the dream also come true? 



16 


That afternoon, about an hour before dinnertime, Evan called Andy. “Can I come 
over?” he asked. “I have a small problem.” 

“Sounds like a big problem,” Andy said. 

“Yeah. Okay. A big problem,” Evan snapped impatiently. “I’m not in the 
mood to kid around, okay?” 

“Okay. Sorry,” Andy replied quickly. “Any sign of Rick and Tony? They’re 
not your problem, are they?” 

“Not at the moment,” he told her. “I told you, they were gone by the time I 
caught up with Trigger. Disappeared. Vanished. Trigger was still barking his 
head off. Somehow I dragged him home and got him in his pen.” 

“So what’s your problem?” she asked. 

“I can’t tell you. I have to show you,” he said. “I’ll be right there. Bye.” 

He hung up the phone and hurried down the stairs, carrying the bucket. 
Kathryn was in the kitchen, her back to him, chopping away at something with 
her big butcher knife. Evan hurried past and darted out the door. 

Andy’s house was a modern, redwood ranch style, with a low hedge of 
evergreens running along the front. Her dad, she said, was a fanatic about the 
lawn. It was clipped a perfect inch and a half above the ground, smooth as a 
carpet. A flower garden stretched along the front of the house, tall orange and 
yellow tiger lilies bobbing in the gentle breeze. 

The front door was open. Evan knocked on the screen door. 

“What’s with the bucket?” was Andy’s greeting as she let him in. 

“Look,” he said, out of breath from running all the way to her house. He 
held up the aluminum bucket he had taken from Kathryn’s garage. 

“Oh, wow,” Andy exclaimed, raising her hands to her face as she stared into 
it wide-eyed. 

“Yeah. Wow,” he repeated sarcastically. “The Monster Blood. It’s grown 
again. Look. It’s almost filled this big bucket. What are we going to do?” 

“What do you mean we?” Andy teased, leading him into the den. 

“Not funny,” he muttered. 

“You didn’t want to share it,” she insisted. 



“I’ll share it now,” he said eagerly. “In fact... do you want it? I’ll give it to 
you for a bargain price—free.” He held the bucket toward her. 

“Huh-uh.” Andy shook her head, crossing her arms in front of her chest. 
“Put it down, will you?” She pointed to the corner behind the red leather couch. 
“Put it over there. It’s giving me the creeps.” 

“Giving you the creeps!?” Evan cried. “What am I going to do? Every time 
I turn around, it grows some more. It’s growing faster than Trigger!” 

“Hey!” they both cried at once. 

Both had the same thought, the same frightening memory. Both suddenly 
remembered that Trigger had eaten a ball of the green gunk. 

“Do you think...” Evan started. 

“Maybe...” Andy replied, not waiting for him to finish his thought. “Maybe 
Trigger’s growing because he ate the Monster Blood.” 

“What am I going to do?” Evan wailed, pacing the room nervously, his 
hands shoved into his jeans pockets. “The stuff is getting bigger and bigger, and 
so is poor Trigger. I’m all alone here. There’s no one who can help me. No one.” 

“What about your aunt?” Andy suggested, staring at the bucket on the floor 
in the corner. “Maybe Kathryn can think of something—” 

“Are you kidding? She can’t hear me. She doesn’t want to hear me. She 
hates me. She just sits at her jigsaw puzzle and argues with that horrible black 
cat all day.” 

“Okay. Forget the aunt,” Andy said, making a dispirited face. 

“Perhaps if you told Dr. Forrest—” 

“Oh, yeah. For sure,” Evan snapped. “He’d really believe that Trigger is 
turning into a giant because I let him eat Monster Blood.” 

He threw himself down on the couch. “I’m all alone here, Andy. There’s no 
one to help me. No one I can even talk to about this.” 

“Except me?” 

“Yeah,” he said, locking his eyes on hers. “Except you.” 

She plopped down on the other end of the couch. “Well, what can I do?” 
she asked hesitantly. 

He jumped up and carried the bucket over. “Take some of this. Let’s split it 

up.” 

“Huh? Why don’t we just toss it in the trash?” she asked, staring down at it. 
The green gunk was pushing up near the top of the bucket. 

“Toss it? We can’t,” he said. 



“Sure, we can. Come on. I’ll show you.” She reached for the bucket handle, 
but he shoved it out of her reach. 

“What if it outgrows the trash can?” he asked. “What if it just keeps 
growing?” 

Andy shrugged. “I don’t know.” 

“Also, I have to save it,” Evan continued excitedly. “If it’s really the thing 
that’s causing Trigger to grow, I’ll need it as proof. You know. To show the 
doctors or whatever. So they can cure Trigger.” 

“Maybe we should call the police,” Andy said thoughtfully, tugging at a 
strand of hair. 

“Oh. Sure,” Evan replied, rolling his eyes. “They’ll really believe us. For 
sure. 'We bought this stuff in a toy store, officer, and now it’s growing bigger 
and bigger and it’s turning my dog into a giant monster.’” 

“Okay, okay. You’re right,” Andy said. “We can’t call the police.” 

“So, are you going to help me?” Evan demanded. “Will you take some of 
this stuff?” 

“I guess,” she said reluctantly. “But just a little.” She climbed to her feet, 
carefully stepping around the bucket. “I’ll be right back.” 

She left the room, then quickly returned, carrying an empty coffee can. “Fill 
’er up,” she said, smiling. 

Evan stared at the coffee can. “That’s all you’re going to take?” he 
complained. Then he immediately softened his tone. “Okay. Okay. It’s a help.” 

Andy crouched down and dipped the coffee can into the middle of the 
bucket. “Hey!” she cried out. Her hands flew up and she tumbled back onto the 
floor. 

“What’s wrong?” Evan hurried over to her. 

“It was pulling the coffee can in,” she said, her features tight with fear and 
surprise. “Sucking it. Look.” 

Evan peered into the bucket. The coffee can had disappeared under the 
surface. “Huh?” 

“I could feel it pulling,” Andy said shakily. She regained her perch over the 
bucket. 

“Let’s see,” Evan said, and plunged both hands into the middle of the 
Monster Blood. 

“Yuck,” Andy said. “This is really gross.” 

“It’s pulling. You’re right,” Evan agreed. “It feels like it’s pulling my hands 



down. Wow. It’s so warm. As if it’s alive.” 

“Don X say that! ” Andy cried with a shudder. “Just get the can out, okay?” 

Evan had to tug hard, but he managed to pull up the coffee can, filled to the 
top with the quivering green substance. “Yuck.” 

“You sure I have to take this?” Andy asked, not reaching for it even though 
he was holding it out to her. 

“Just for a little while,” he said. “Till we think of a better plan.” 

“Maybe we could feed it to the Beymer twins,” Andy suggested, finally 
taking the can. 

“Then we’d have giant Beymer twins,” Evan joked. “No, thank you.” 

“Seriously, you’d better watch out for them,” Andy warned. “If Trigger 
scared them away this morning, they’ll be looking to get back at you. They 
really think they’re tough dudes, Evan. They can be vicious. They could really 
hurt you.” 

“Thanks for trying to cheer me up,” Evan said glumly. He was still pulling 
tiny, clinging clumps of the Monster Blood off his hands and tossing them into 
the bucket. 

“I was watching a video before you came over. The first Indiana Jones 
movie. Want to watch it?” 

Evan shook his head. “No. I’d better go. Aunt Kathryn was busy making 
dinner when I left. Chopping up some kind of meat. Another great dinner, sitting 
there in silence, being stared at by Aunt Kathryn and her cat.” 

“Poor Evan,” Andy said, half teasing, half sympathetic. 

He picked up the bucket, now only two-thirds full, and let her walk him to 
the front door. “Call me later, okay?” she asked. 

He nodded and stepped outside. She closed the door behind him. 

He was halfway to the sidewalk when the Beymer twins slipped out from 
behind the evergreen hedge, their hands balled into red, beefy fists. 



17 


The brothers stepped out of the shadows of the hedge. Their short blond hair 
caught the late afternoon sunlight. They were both grinning gleefully. 

Evan stood frozen in place, staring from one to the other. 

No one said a word. 

One of the Beymers grabbed the bucket from Evan’s hand and tossed it to 
the ground. The bucket hit with a heavy thud, and its thick, green contents oozed 
onto the grass, making disgusting sucking sounds. 

“Hey—” Evan cried, breaking the tense silence. 

He didn’t have a chance to say more. 

The other twin punched him hard in the stomach. 

Evan felt the pain radiate through his body. The punch took his breath away. 
He gasped for air. 

He didn’t see the next punch. It landed on his cheek just below his right 

eye. 

He howled in pain, and his hands flailed the air helplessly. 

Both brothers were hitting him now. And then one of them gave Evan’s 
shoulders a hard shove, and he went sprawling onto the cool, damp grass. 

The pain swept over him, blanketing him, followed by a wave of nausea. 
He closed his eyes, gasping noisily, waiting for the sharp ache in his stomach to 
fade. 

The ground seemed to tilt. He reached out and grabbed it, and held on 
tightly so he wouldn’t fall off. 

When he finally managed to raise his head, Andy was standing over him, 
her eyes wide with alarm. “Evan—” 

He groaned and, pushing with both hands, tried to sit up. The dizziness, the 
spinning, tilting grass, forced him to lie back down. 

“Are they gone?” he asked, closing his eyes, willing the dizziness away. 
“Rick and Tony? I saw them run away,” Andy said, kneeling beside him. 
“Are you okay? Should I call my mom?” 

He opened his eyes. “Yeah. No. I don’t know.” 

“What happened ?” she demanded. 

He raised a hand to his cheek. “Ow!” It was already swollen, too painful to 



touch. 

“They beat you up?” 

“Either that or I was hit by a truck,” he groaned. 

A few minutes later—it seemed like hours—he was back on his feet, 
breathing normally, rubbing his swollen cheek. “I’ve never been in a fight 
before,” he told Andy, shaking his head. “Never.” 

“It doesn’t look like it was much of a fight,” she said, her expression still 
tight with concern. 

He started to laugh, but it made his stomach hurt. 

“We’ll pay them back,” Andy said bitterly. “We’ll find a way to pay them 
back. The creeps.” 

“Oh. Look. The Monster Blood.” Evan hurried over to it. 

The bucket lay on its side. The green gunk had oozed onto the grass, 
forming a wide, thick puddle. 

“I’ll help you get it back in the bucket,” Andy said, leaning over to stand 
the bucket up. “Hope it doesn’t kill the grass. My dad’ll have a cow if his 
precious lawn is hurt!” 

“It’s so heavy,” Evan said, groaning as he tried to push the glob into the 
bucket. “It doesn’t want to move.” 

“Let’s try picking up handfuls,” Andy suggested. 

“Whoa. It doesn’t want to come apart,” Evan said in surprise. “Look. It 
sticks together.” 

“It’s like taffy,” Andy said. “Ever see them make taffy in those taffy 
machines? The stuff just sticks together in one big glob.” 

“This isn’t taffy,” Evan muttered. “It’s disgusting.” 

Working together, they managed to lift the entire green ball and drop it into 
the bucket. The stuff made a sickening sucking sound as it filled the bucket, and 
both Evan and Andy had trouble pulling their hands out of it. 

“It’s so sticky,” Andy said, making a disgusted face. 

“And warm,” Evan added. He finally managed to free his hands from it. 
“It’s like it’s trying to swallow my hands,” he said, wiping his hands on his T- 
shirt. “Sucking them in.” 

“Take it home,” Andy said. She looked up to the house to see her mother 
motioning to her from the front window. “Uh-oh. Dinnertime. I’ve got to go.” 
Her eyes stopped at his swollen cheek. “Wait till your aunt sees you.” 

“She probably won’t even notice,” Evan said glumly. He picked up the 



bucket by the handle. “What are we going to do with this stuff?” 

“We’ll take it back to the toy store tomorrow,” Andy replied, taking long 
strides across the lawn to the house. 

“Huh?” 

“That’s what we’ll do. We’ll simply take it back.” 

Evan didn’t think it was such a hot idea. But he didn’t have the strength to 
argue about it now. He watched Andy disappear into the house. Then he headed 
slowly back to Kathryn’s, his head throbbing, his stomach aching. 

Creeping along the wall of the house, he slipped into the garage through the 
side door to hide the bucket of Monster Blood. Sliding it behind an overturned 
wheelbarrow, he realized that the bucket was full to the top. 

But I gave Andy a big hunk of it, he thought. The bucket had been only 
two-thirds full. 

I’ll have to find a bigger place to put it, he decided. Tonight. Maybe there’s 
a box or something in the basement. 

He crept into the house, determined to clean himself up before seeing 
Kathryn. She was still busy in the kitchen, he saw, leaning over the stove, putting 
the last touches on dinner. He tiptoed up the stairs and washed up. Unable to do 
much about his swollen, red cheek, he changed into a clean pair of baggy shorts 
and a fresh T-shirt, and carefully brushed his hair. 

As they sat down at the dining room table, Kathryn’s eyes fell on Evan’s 
swollen cheek. “You been in a fight?” she asked, squinting suspiciously at him. 
“You’re a little roughneck, aren’t you? Just like your father. Chicken was always 
getting into scrapes, always picking on boys twice his size.” 

“I wasn’t exactly picking on them,” Evan muttered, spearing a chunk of 
beef from his stew with his fork. 

All through dinner, Kathryn stared at his swollen cheek. But she didn’t say 
another word. 

She doesn’t care if I’m hurt or not, Evan thought miserably. 

She really doesn’t care. 

She didn’t even ask if it hurts. 

In a way, he was grateful. He didn’t need her getting all upset, making a 
fuss because he was in a fight, maybe calling his parents in Atlanta and telling 
them. 

Well... she couldn’t call his parents. She couldn’t use the phone, since she 
couldn’t hear. 



Evan downed his big plate of beef stew. It was pretty good, except for the 
vegetables. 

The silence seemed so loud. He began thinking about his problem—the 
Monster Blood. 

Should he tell Kathryn about it? 

He could write down the whole problem on the yellow pad and hand it to 
her to read. It would feel so good to tell someone, to have an adult take over the 
problem and handle it. 

But not his Aunt Kathryn, he decided. 

She was too weird. 

She wouldn’t understand. 

She wouldn’t know what to do. 

And she wouldn’t care. 

Andy was right. They had to carry the stuff back to the toy store. Give it 
back. Just get rid of it. 

But in the meantime, he had to find something to keep it in. 

Evan waited in his room until he heard Kathryn go to bed, a little after ten 
o’clock. Then he crept down the stairs and headed out to the garage. 



18 


It was a cool, clear night. Crickets sent up a relentless curtain of noise. The black 
sky glittered with tiny specks of stars. 

The round beam of light from the flashlight in his hand darted across the 
driveway, leading Evan to the dark garage. As he entered, something scuttled 
across the floor near the back wall. 

Maybe it was just a dead leaf, blown by the wind when I opened the door, 
he thought hopefully. 

He moved the flashlight unsteadily, beaming it onto the overturned 
wheelbarrow. Then the light darted across the garage ceiling as he bent down, 
reached behind the wheelbarrow, and pulled out the bucket of Monster Blood. 

He moved the light to the center of the bucket, and gasped. 

The green substance was quivering up over the top. 

It’s growing much faster than before, he thought. 

I’ve got to find something bigger to hide it in—just for tonight. 

The bucket was too heavy to carry with one hand. Tucking the flashlight 
into his armpit, he gripped the bucket handle with both hands and hoisted the 
bucket off the floor. 

Struggling to keep from spilling it, he made his way into the dark house. He 
paused at the door to the basement steps, silently setting the heavy bucket down 
on the linoleum floor. 

He clicked the light switch on the wall. Somewhere downstairs a dim light 
flickered on, casting a wash of pale yellow light over the concrete floor. 

There’s got to be something to put this stuff in down there, Evan thought. 
Hoisting up the bucket, he made his way slowly, carefully down the steep, dark 
stairway, leaning his shoulder against the wall to steady himself. 

Waiting for his eyes to adjust to the pale light, he saw that the basement was 
one large room, low-ceilinged and damp. It was cluttered with cartons, stacks of 
old newspapers and magazines, and old furniture and appliances covered in 
stained, yellowed bed sheets. 

Something brushed his face as he stepped away from the stairs. 

He uttered a silent cry and, dropping the bucket, raised his hands to swipe at 
the thick cobwebs that seemed to reach out for him. They clung to his skin, dry 



and scratchy, as he frantically pulled at them. 

He suddenly realized it wasn’t the web that was moving against his cheek. 

It was a spider. 

With a sharp intake of breath, he brushed it away. But even after he saw the 
insect scuttle across the floor, he could still feel its prickly feet moving on his 
face. 

Moving quickly away from the wall, his heart pounding now, his eyes 
searching the open wooden shelves hidden in shadow against the far wall, he 
stumbled over something on the floor. 

“Oh!” He fell headfirst over it, throwing his hands forward to break his fall. 

A human body! 

Someone lying there under him! 

No. 

Calm down, Evan. Calm down, he instructed himself. 

He pulled himself shakily to his feet. 

It was a dressmaker’s dummy he had stumbled over. Probably a model of 
Kathryn when she was younger. 

He rolled it out of the way as his eyes searched the shadowy room for a 
container to store the Monster Blood. What was that long, low object in front of 
the worktable? 

Moving closer, he saw that it was an old bathtub, the insides stained and 
peeling. It’s big enough, he realized, and quickly decided to store the green gunk 
inside it. 

With a loud groan, he hoisted the bucket onto the side of the old tub. His 
stomach muscles were still sore from the punch he had taken, and the pain shot 
through his body. 

He waited for the aching to fade, then tilted the bucket. The thick green 
substance rolled out of the bucket and hit the tub bottom with a sickening soft 
plop. 

Evan set the bucket aside and stared down at the Monster Blood, watching 
it ooze, spreading thickly over the bottom of the bathtub. To his surprise, the tub 
appeared nearly half full. 

How fast was this stuff growing?! 

He was leaning over the tub, about to make his way back upstairs, when he 
heard the cat screech. 

Startled, he let go of the side of the tub just as Sarabeth leapt onto his back. 



Evan didn’t have time to cry out as he toppled forward, over the edge of the tub 
and into the thick, green gunk. 



19 


Evan landed hard on his elbows, but the thick Monster Blood softened the fall. 
He heard the cat screech again and pad away. 

He sank into the ooze, his arms and legs flailing, trying to lift himself away. 
But the sticky substance was sucking him down, pulling him with surprising 
force. 

His whole body seemed to be held by it, stuck as if in cement, and now it 
was quivering up, bubbling silently, rising up to his face. I’m going to suffocate, 
he realized. 

It’s trying to choke me. 

The warmth of it spread across his body, invaded his chest, his legs, his 
throat. 

I can’t move. 

I’m stuck. 

It’s trying to choke me. 

No! 

He pulled his head up just as the green gunk began to cover his face. 

Then he struggled to twist his body, to twist himself around in it. With great 
effort, panting loudly, hoarse cries escaping his open lips, he pulled himself up 
into a sitting position. 

The green substance rose up even higher, as if it were reaching up to him, 
reaching to drag him back down into it. 

Evan gripped the side of the tub with both hands, held on to it tightly, and 
began to force himself up. Up, up from the clinging, pulling ooze. Up from the 
strange force that seemed to be drawing him back with renewed power. 

Up. Up. 

“No!” he managed to scream as the warm, green ooze slid over his 
shoulders. 

“No!” 

It was gripping his shoulders now, sliding around his neck, sucking him 
down, pulling him back into its sticky depths. 

Down. Down. 

It’s got me, he realized. 



It’s got me now. 



20 


“No!” Evan screamed aloud as the green gunk bubbled up to his neck. 

Pulling him. Pulling him down. 

“No!” 

Try again. Up. 

Try again. 

Up. Up. 

Yes! 

Gripping the sides of the tub, he was moving upward, pulling himself, 
hoisting himself, straining with all of his strength. 

Yes! Yes! He was beating it. 

He was stronger than it was. One more tug and he would be free. 

With a relieved sigh, he dropped over the side of the tub onto the cool 
basement floor. 

And lay there, pressed against the damp concrete, waiting to catch his 
breath. 

When he looked up, Sarabeth stood a few feet away, her head cocked to one 
side, her yellow eyes peering into his, an expression of supreme satisfaction on 
her dark feline face. 

The next morning, after a fitful, restless sleep, Evan brought the pad of yellow 
lined paper and a marker to the breakfast table. 

“Well, well,” Kathryn greeted him, placing a bowl of shredded wheat in 
front of him, “you certainly look like something the cat dragged in!” She 
laughed, shaking her head. 

“Don’t mention cat to me,” Evan muttered. He shoved the bowl of cereal 
aside and pointed to the pad in his hand. 

“Don’t let your cereal get soggy,” Kathryn scolded, reaching to push the 
bowl back to him. “You get more of the vitamins that way. And it’s good 
roughage.” 

“I don’t care about your stupid roughage,” Evan said moodily, knowing she 
couldn’t hear him. He pointed to the pad again, and then began to write, 
scribbling quickly in big, black letters. 



His writing caught her interest. She moved around the table and stood 
behind him, her eyes on the pad as he wrote his desperate message. 

I HAVE A PROBLEM, he wrote. I NEED YOUR HELP. THE BATHTUB 
DOWNSTAIRS IS OVERFLOWING WITH GREEN MONSTER BLOOD 
AND I CANT STOP IT. 

He put down the marker and held the pad up close to her face. 

Looking up at her from the chair, seeing her pale face in the morning 
sunlight as she leaned over him in her gray flannel bathrobe, Kathryn suddenly 
looked very old to him. Only her eyes, those vibrant, blue eyes running quickly 
over his words, seemed youthful and alive. 

Her lips were pursed tightly in concentration as she read what he had 
written. Then, as Evan stared eagerly up at her, her mouth spread into a wide 
smile. She tossed back her head and laughed. 

Completely bewildered by her reaction, Evan slid his chair back and 
jumped up. She rested a hand on his shoulder and gave him a playful shove. 

“Don’t kid an old woman!” she exclaimed, shaking her head. She turned 
and headed back to her side of the table. “I thought you were serious. I guess 
you’re not like your father at all. He never played any dumb jokes or tricks. 
Chicken was always such a serious boy.” 

“I don’t care about Chicken!” Evan shouted, losing control, and tossed the 
pad angrily onto the breakfast table. 

His aunt burst out laughing. She didn’t seem to notice that Evan was glaring 
at her in frustration, his hands tightened into fists at his sides. 

“Monster Blood! What an imagination!” She wiped tears of laughter from 
her eyes with her fingers. Then suddenly, her expression turned serious. She 
grabbed his earlobe and squeezed it. 

“I warned you,” she whispered. “I warned you to be careful.” 

“Ow!” 

When he cried out in pain, she let go of his ear, her eyes glowing like blue 
jewels. 

I’ve got to get out of here, Evan thought, rubbing his tender earlobe. He 
turned and strode quickly from the kitchen and up to his room. 

I knew she wouldn’t be any help, he thought bitterly. 

She’s just a crazy old lady. 

I should pull her down to the basement and show her the disgusting stuff, he 
thought, angrily tossing the clothes he had worn yesterday onto the floor. 



But what’s the point? She’d probably laugh at that, too. 

She isn’t going to help me. 

He had only one person he could rely on, he knew. 

Andy. 

He called her, punching in her number with trembling fingers. 

“Hi. You’re right,” he said, not giving her a chance to say anything. “We 
have to take the stuff back to the store.” 

“If we can carry it,” Andy replied, sounding worried. “That hunk of 
Monster Blood you gave me—it outgrew the coffee can. I put it in my parents’ 
ice bucket, but it’s outgrowing that.” 

“How about a plastic garbage bag?” Evan suggested. “You know. One of 
the really big lawn bags? We can probably carry it in a couple of those.” 

“It’s worth a try,” Andy said. “This stuff is so disgusting. It’s making all 
these sick noises, and it’s really sticky.” 

“Tell me about it,” Evan replied gloomily, remembering the night before. “I 
took a swim in it.” 

“Huh? You can explain later,” she said impatiently. “The toy store opens at 
ten, I think. I can meet you on the corner in twenty minutes.” 

“Good deal.” Evan hung up the phone and headed to the garage to get a 
plastic lawn bag. 

Andy showed up with her plastic bag wrapped around the handlebars of her 
BMX bike. Once again, Evan had to go along beside her on foot. His plastic bag 
was bulging, and so heavy he had to drag it over the sidewalk. He couldn’t lift it. 

“The tub was nearly full to the top,” he told Andy, groaning as he struggled 
to pull the bag over the curb. “I’m afraid it’s going to burst out of this bag.” 

“Only two blocks to go,” she said, trying to sound reassuring. A car rolled 
by slowly. The driver, a teenager with long black hair, stuck his head out the 
window, grinning. “What’s in the bag? A dead body?” 

“Just garbage,” Evan told him. 

“That’s for sure,” Andy muttered as the car rolled away. 

Several people stopped to stare at them as they entered town. “Hi, Mrs. 
Winslow,” Andy called to a friend of her mother’s. 

Mrs. Winslow waved, then gave Andy a curious stare, and headed into the 
grocery. 

Andy climbed off her bike and walked it. Evan continued to drag his 



bulging bag behind him. 

They made their way to the next block, then started to cross the street to the 
toy store. 

But they both stopped short in the middle of the street. 

And gaped in shock. 

The door and window of the store were boarded up. A small, hand-printed 
sign tacked to the top of the door read: OUT OF BUSINESS. 



21 


Desperate to get rid of the disgusting contents of the garbage bags, Evan 
pounded on the door anyway. 

“Come on—somebody! Somebody, open up!” 

No reply. 

He pounded with both fists. 

Silence. 

Finally, Andy had to pull him away. 

“The store is closed,” a young woman called from across the street. “It 
closed a few days ago. See? It’s all boarded up and everything.” 

“Very helpful,” Evan muttered under his breath. He slammed his hand 
angrily against the door. 

“Evan—stop. You’ll hurt yourself,” Andy warned. 

“Now what?” Evan demanded. “Got any more fantastic ideas, Andy?” 

She shrugged. “It’s your turn to come up with something brilliant.” 

Evan sighed miserably. “Maybe I could give it to Kathryn and tell her it’s 
beef. Then she’d chop it up with that knife she’s always carrying around.” 

“I don’t think you’re thinking too clearly right now,” Andy said, putting a 
sympathetic hand on his shoulder. 

They both stared down at the garbage bags. They appeared to be moving— 
expanding and contracting, as if the green globs inside were breathing ! 

“Let’s go back to Kathryn’s,” Evan said, his voice trembling. “Maybe we’ll 
think of something on the way.” 

Somehow they managed to drag the Monster Blood back to Kathryn’s 
house. The sun had gotten high in the sky. As they headed to the backyard, Evan 
was drenched with sweat. His arms ached. His head throbbed. 

“Now what?” he asked weakly, letting go of the bulging lawn bag. 

Andy leaned her bike against the side of the garage. She pointed to the big 
aluminum trash can next to the garage door. “How about that? It looks pretty 
sturdy.” She walked over to it to investigate. “And look—the lid clamps down.” 

“Okay,” Evan agreed, wiping his forehead with the sleeve of his T-shirt. 

Andy pulled off the lid of the big can. Then she dumped in the contents of 
her bag. It hit the bottom with a sick, squishy sound. Then she hurried to help 



Evan. 

“It’s so heavy,” Evan groaned, struggling to pull the bag up. 

“We can do it,” Andy insisted. 

Working together, they managed to slide the Monster Blood from the plastic 
bag. It rolled out like a tidal wave, sloshing noisily against the sides of the can, 
raising up as if trying to escape. 

With a loud sigh of relief, Evan slammed the metal lid down on top of it 
and clamped the handles down. 

“Whoa!” Andy cried. 

They both stared at the can for a long moment, as if expecting it to explode 
or burst apart. “Now what?” Evan asked, his features tight with fear. 

Before Andy could reply, they saw Kathryn step out of the kitchen door. 
Her eyes searched the backyard until she spotted them. “Evan—good news!” she 
called. 

Glancing back at the trash can, Evan and Andy came hurrying over. 
Kathryn was holding a yellow piece of paper in her hand. A telegram. 

“Your mother is coming to pick you up this afternoon,” Kathryn said, a 
wide smile on her face. 

I think Kathryn is glad to get rid of me, was Evan’s first thought. 

And then, dismissing that thought, he leapt up and whooped for joy. It was 
the best news he’d ever received. 

“I’m outta here!” he exclaimed after his aunt had returned to the house. 
“I’m outta here! I can’t wait!” 

Andy didn’t appear to share his joy. “You’re leaving your aunt a nice little 
surprise over there,” she said, pointing to the trash can. 

“I don’t care! I’m outta here!” Evan repeated, raising his hand for Andy to 
slap him a high five. 

She didn’t cooperate. “Don’t you think we have to tell someone about the 
Monster Blood? Or do something about it—before you leave?” 

But Evan was too excited to think about that now. “Hey, Trigger!” he 
called, running to the dog’s pen at the back of the yard. “Trigger—we’re going 
home, boy!” 

Evan pulled open the gate—and gasped. 



22 


“Trigger!” 

The dog that came bounding toward him looked like Trigger. But the cocker 
spaniel was the size of a pony! He had doubled in size since the day before! 

“No!” Evan had to hit the dirt as Trigger excitedly tried to jump on him. 
“Hey—wait!” 

Before Evan could get up, Trigger began barking ferociously. The huge dog 
was already past the gate and thundering across the backyard toward the street. 

“I don’t believe it!” Andy cried, raising her hands to her face, staring in 
shock as the enormous creature bounded around the side of the house and out of 
sight. “He’s so—big!” 

“We’ve got to stop him! He might hurt someone!” Evan cried. 

“Trigger! Trigger—come back!” Still off balance, Evan started to run, 
calling frantically. But he stumbled over Andy’s bike and fell onto the trash can. 

“No!” Andy shrieked, looking on helplessly as the metal can toppled over, 
with Evan sprawled on top of it. The can hit the driveway with a loud clang. 

The lid popped off and rolled away. 

The green gunk poured out. 

It oozed away from the can, then stopped and appeared to stand up. 
Quivering, making loud sucking sounds, it righted itself, pulling itself up tall. 

As the two kids stared in silent horror, the quivering green mass appeared to 
come to life, like a newly born creature pulling itself up, stretching, looking 
around. 

Then, with a loud sucking sound, it arched toward Evan, who was still 
sprawled on the toppled can. 

“Get up, Evan!” Andy cried. “Get up! It’s going to roll right over you!” 



23 


“Noooooo!” 

Evan uttered an animal cry, a sound he had never made before—and rolled 
away as the quivering green ball bounced toward him. 

“Run, Evan!” Andy screamed. She grabbed his hand and pulled him to his 
feet. “It’s alive!” she cried. “Run!” 

The Monster Blood heaved itself against the garage wall. It seemed to stick 
there for a brief second. Then it peeled off, and came bouncing toward them with 
surprising speed. 

“Help! Help!” 

“Somebody—please— help ! ” 

Screaming at the top of their lungs, Evan and Andy took off. Scrambling as 
fast as he could, his legs weak and rubbery from fear, Evan followed Andy down 
the driveway toward the front yard. 

“Help! Oh, please! Help us!” 

Evan’s voice was hoarse from screaming. His heart thudded in his chest. 
His temples throbbed. 

He turned and saw that the Monster Blood was right behind them, picking 
up speed as it bounced across the yard, making disgusting squishing noises with 
each bounce. 

Plop. Plop. Plop. 

A robin, pulling at a worm in the grass, didn’t look up in time. The 
trembling green mass rolled over it. 

“Oh!” Evan moaned, turning back to see the bird sucked into the green ball. 
Its wings flapping frantically, the bird uttered a final cry, then disappeared inside. 

Plop. Plop. Plop. 

The Monster Blood changed direction, still bouncing and quivering, and 
leaving white stains on the grass like enormous, round footsteps. 

“It’s alive!” Andy screamed, her hands pressed against her cheeks. “Oh, my 
God—it’s a/z've!” 

“What can we do? What can we do?” Evan didn’t recognize his own 
terrified voice. 

“It’s catching up!” Andy screamed, pulling him by the hand. “Run!” 



Gasping loudly, they made their way to the front of the house. 

“Hey—what’s happening?” a voice called. 

“Huh?” 

Startled by the voice, Evan stopped short. He looked to the sidewalk to see 
the Beymer twins, matching grins on their beefy faces. 

“My favorite punching bag,” one of them said to Evan. He raised his fist 
menacingly. 

They took a few steps toward Evan and Andy. Then their grins faded and 
their mouths dropped open in horror as the gigantic green mass appeared, 
heading down the drive, rolling as fast as a bicycle. 

“Look out!” Evan screamed. 

“Run!” Andy cried. 

But the two brothers were too startled to move. 

Their eyes bulging with fear, they threw their hands up as if trying to shield 
themselves. 

Plop. Plop. Plop. 

The enormous ball of Monster Blood picked up speed as it bounced 
forward. Evan shut his eyes as it hit the twins with a deafening smack. 

“Ow!” 

“No!” 

Both brothers cried out, flailing their arms, struggling to pull themselves 

free. 

“Help us! Please—help us!” 

Their bodies twisted and writhed as they struggled. 

But they were stuck tight. The green gunk oozed over them, covering them 
completely. 

Then it pulled them inside with a loud sucking pop. 

Andy shielded her eyes. “Sick,” she muttered. “Oooh. Sick.” 

Evan gasped in helpless horror as the Beymer brothers finally stopped 
struggling. 

Their arms went limp. Their faces disappeared into the quivering gunk. 

The sucking sounds grew louder as the two boys were pulled deeper and 
deeper inside. Then the Monster Blood bounced high, turned, and started back 
up the drive. 

Andy and Evan froze, unsure of which way to head. 

“Split up!” Evan cried. “It can’t go after us both!” 



Andy returned his frightened stare. She opened her mouth, but no sound 
came out. 

“Split up! Split up!” Evan repeated shrilly. 

“But—” Andy started. 

Before she could say anything, the front door of the house burst open, and 
Kathryn stepped out onto the stoop. 

“Hey—what are you kids doing? What’s that?” she cried, gripping the 
screen door, her eyes filling with horror. 

Picking up speed, the giant ball bounded toward the stoop. 

Kathryn tossed up her hands in fright. She stood frozen for a long moment, 
as if trying to make sense of what she was seeing. Then, leaving the front door 
wide open, she spun around and fled into the house. 

Plop. Plop. 

The Monster Blood hesitated at the front stoop. 

It bounced in place once, twice, three times, as if considering what to do 

next. 

Evan and Andy gaped in horror from across the lawn, trying to catch their 
breath. 

A wave of nausea swept over Evan as he saw the Beymer twins, still visible 
deep within the quivering glob, faceless prisoners bouncing inside it. 

Then suddenly, the Monster Blood bounced high and hurtled up the stairs of 
the stoop. 

“No!” Evan screamed as it squeezed through the open doorway and 
disappeared into the house. 

From the middle of the yard, Andy and Evan heard Kathryn’s bloodcurdling 
scream. 

“It’s got Aunt Kathryn,” Evan said weakly. 



24 


Evan reached the house first. He had run so fast, his lungs felt as if they were 
about to burst. 

“What are you going to do?” Andy called, following close behind. 

“I don’t know,” Evan replied. He grabbed on to the screen door and 
propelled himself into the house. 

“Aunt Kathryn!” Evan screamed, bursting into the living room. 

The enormous glob filled the center of the small room. The Beymer twins 
were outlined in its side as it bounced and quivered, oozing over the carpet, 
leaving its sticky footprints in its path. 

It took Evan a few seconds to see his aunt. The bouncing hunk of Monster 
Blood had backed her against the fireplace. 

“Aunt Kathryn—run!” Evan cried. 

But even he could see that she had nowhere to mn. 

“Get out of here, kids!” Kathryn cried, her voice shrill and trembling, 
suddenly sounding very old. 

“But, Aunt Kathryn—” 

“Get out of here—now!” the old woman insisted, her black hair wild about 
her head, her eyes, those blue, penetrating eyes, staring hard at the green glob as 
if willing it away. 

Evan turned to Andy, uncertain of what to do. 

Andy’s hands tugged at the sides of her hair, her eyes wide with growing 
fear as the seething green glob made its way steadily closer to Evan’s aunt. 

“Get out!” Kathryn repeated shrilly. “Save your lives! I made this thing! 
Now I must die for it!” 

Evan gasped. 

Had he heard correctly? 

What had his aunt just said? 

The words repeated in his mind, clear now, so clear—and so frightening. 

“I made this thing. Now I must die for it. ” 



25 


“No!” 

Gaping in horror, as the sickening glob of Monster Blood pushed toward his 
aunt, Evan felt the room tilt and begin to spin. He gripped the back of Kathryn’s 
armchair as pictures flooded his mind. 

He saw the strange bone pendant Kathryn always wore around her neck. 

The mysterious books that lined the walls of his bedroom. 

Sarabeth, the black cat with the glowing yellow eyes. 

The black shawl Kathryn always wrapped around her shoulders in the 
evening. 

“I made this thing. Now I must die for it. ” 

Evan saw it all now, and it began to come clear to him. 

Evan pictured the day he and Andy brought home the can of Monster Blood 
from the toy store. Kathryn had insisted on seeing it. 

On studying it. 

On touching it. 

He remembered the way she rolled the can around in her hands, examining 
it so carefully. Moving her lips silently as she read the label. 

What had she been doing? What had she been saying? 

A thought flashed into Evan’s mind. 

Had she been casting a spell on the can? 

A spell to make the Monster Blood grow? A spell to terrify Evan? 

But why? She didn’t even know Evan. 

Why did she want to frighten him? To... kill him? 

“Be careful,” she had called to him after handing the blue can back. “Be 
careful.” 

It was a real warning. 

A warning against her spell. 

“You did this!” Evan shouted in a voice he didn’t recognize. The words 
burst out of him. He had no control over them. 

“You did this! You cast a spell!” he repeated, pointing an accusing finger at 
his aunt. 



He saw her blue eyes shimmer as they read his lips. Then her eyes filled 
with tears, tears that overflowed onto her pale cheeks. 

“No!” she cried. “No!” 

“You did something to the can! You did this, Aunt Kathryn!” 

“No!” she cried, shouting over the sickening grunts and plops of the 
mountainous ball that nearly hid her from view. 

“No!” Kathryn cried, her back pressed tightly against the mantelpiece. “I 
didn’t do it! She did!” 

And she pointed an accusing finger at Andy. 



26 


Andy? 

Was Aunt Kathryn accusing Andy? 

Evan spun around to confront Andy. 

But Andy turned, too. 

And Evan realized immediately that his aunt wasn’t pointing at Andy. She 
was pointing past Andy to Sarabeth. 

Standing in the doorway to the living room, the black cat hissed and arched 
her back, her yellow eyes flaring at Kathryn. 

“She did it! She’s the one!” Kathryn declared, pointing frantically. 

The enormous glob of green Monster Blood bounced back, retreated a step, 
as if stung by Kathryn’s words. Shadows shifted inside the glob as it quivered, 
catching the light filtering in through the living room window. 

Evan stared at the cat, then turned his eyes to Andy. She shrugged, her face 
frozen in horror and bewilderment. 

Aunt Kathryn is crazy, Evan thought sadly. 

She’s totally lost it. 

She isn’t making any sense. 

None of this makes sense. 

“She’s the one!” Kathryn repeated. 

The cat hissed in response. 

The glob bounced in place, carrying the unmoving Beymer brothers inside. 

“Oh—look!” Evan cried to Andy as the black cat suddenly raised up on its 
hind legs. 

Andy gasped and squeezed Evan’s arm. Her hand was as cold as ice. 

Still hissing, the cat grew like a shadow against the wall. It raised its claws, 
swiping the air. Its eyes closed, and it became consumed in darkness. 

No one moved. 

The only sounds Evan could hear were the bubbling of the green glob and 
the pounding of his own heart. 

All eyes were on the cat as it rose up, stretched, and grew. And as it grew, it 
changed its shape. 



Became human. 

With shadowy arms and legs in the eerie darkness. 

And then the shadow stepped away from the darkness. 

And Sarabeth was now a young woman with fiery red hair and pale skin 
and yellow eyes, the same yellow cat eyes that had haunted Evan since he’d 
arrived. The young woman was dressed in a swirling black gown down to her 
ankles. 

She stood blocking the doorway, staring accusingly at Kathryn. 

“You see? She’s the one,” Kathryn said, quietly now. And the next words 
were intended only for Sarabeth: “Your spell over me is broken. I will do no 
more work for you.” 

Sarabeth tossed her red hair behind a black-cloaked shoulder and laughed. 
“I’ll decide what you will do, Kathryn.” 

“No,” Kathryn insisted. “For twenty years, you have used me, Sarabeth. For 
twenty years you have imprisoned me here, held me in your spell. But now I will 
use this Monster Blood to escape.” 

Sarabeth laughed again. “There is no escape, fool. All of you must die now. 
All of you.” 



27 


“All of you must die,” Sarabeth repeated. Her smile revealed that she enjoyed 
saying those words. 

Kathryn turned to Evan, her eyes reflecting her fear. “Twenty years ago, I 
thought she was my friend. I was all alone here. I thought I could trust her. But 
she cast a spell on me. And then another. Her dark magic made me deaf. She 
refused to let me lip-read or learn to sign. That was one way she kept me her 
prisoner.” 

“But, Aunt Kathryn—” Evan started. 

She raised a finger to her lips to silence him. 

“Sarabeth forced me to cast the spell on the can of Monster Blood. She had 
warned me that I was allowed no guests, you see. I was her slave. Her personal 
servant for all these years. She wanted me all to herself, to do her evil bidding. 

“When you arrived,” Kathryn continued, her back still pressed against the 
fireplace mantel, “she first decided to scare you away. But that was impossible. 
You had nowhere to go. Then she became desperate to get you out of the way. 
She was terrified that you would learn her secret, that you would somehow free 
me of her spell. So Sarabeth decided that you had to die.” 

Kathryn’s eyes fell. She sighed. “I’m so sorry, Evan. I had no choice, no 
will of my own.” She turned her eyes to Sarabeth. “But no more. No more. No 
more. As I plunge myself into this ghastly creation, Sarabeth, I will end your 
spell. I will end your hold over me.” 

“The children will still die,” Sarabeth said quietly, coldly. 

“What?” Kathryn’s eyes filled with fury. “I will be gone, Sarabeth. You can 
let the children go. You have no reason to do them harm.” 

“They know too much,” Sarabeth replied softly, crossing her slender arms 
in front of her, her yellow eyes aglow. 

“We’ve got to get out of here,” Evan whispered to Andy, staring at the 
seething green glob. 

“But how?” Andy whispered back. “Sarabeth is blocking the doorway.” 

Evan’s eyes darted around the small room, searching for an escape route. 

Nothing. 

Sarabeth raised one hand and drew it toward her slowly, as if summoning 



the green glob. 

It quivered once, twice, then moved obediently in the direction of her hand. 

“No! Sarabeth—stop!” Kathryn pleaded. 

Ignoring Kathryn, Sarabeth gestured with her hand again. 

The green gunk bubbled and rolled forward. 

“Kill the children,” Sarabeth commanded. 

The enormous glob picked up speed as it rolled across the carpet toward 
Evan and Andy. 

“Let’s rush the door,” Evan suggested to Andy, as they backed up away 
from the rolling Monster Blood. 

“SheTl never let us past,” Andy cried. 

“Kill the children!” Sarabeth repeated, raising both hands high above her 
head. 

“Maybe one of us can get by her!” Evan cried. 

“It’s too late!” Andy shrieked. 

The bouncing, pulsating, green glob was just a few feet away. 

“We—we’re going to be sucked in!” Evan screamed. 

“Kill the children!” Sarabeth screamed triumphantly. 



28 


The glob rolled forward. 

Evan sighed, feeling all hope sink. Frozen in place, he felt as if he weighed 
a thousand pounds. 

Andy grabbed his hand. 

They both closed their eyes and held their breath, and waited for the impact. 

To their surprise, the Monster Blood emitted a deafening roar. 

“Huh?” 

Evan opened his eyes. Andy, he saw, was staring at the doorway, beyond 
Sarabeth. 

The Monster Blood hadn’t roared. 

“Trigger!” Evan cried. 

The huge dog bounded into the doorway, its deafening bark echoing off the 
low ceiling. 

Sarabeth tried to get out of the dog’s way. But she was too late. 

Thrilled to see Evan, Trigger enthusiastically leapt at Sarabeth—and pushed 
her from behind. 

Under the weight of the gigantic paws, Sarabeth staggered forward... 
forward... forward—raising her hands as she collided with the Monster Blood. 

There was a wet smack as Sarabeth hit the surface of the green glob. 

Then loud, disgusting sucking noises. 

Her hands hit first. They disappeared quickly. And then Sarabeth was in up 
to her elbows. 

And then the glob seemed to give a hard tug, and her body hit the surface. 
Then her face was pulled in, covered over. 

Sarabeth never uttered a sound as she was pulled inside. 

Whimpering with joy, completely unaware of what he had done, the dog 
loped into the room and headed for Evan. 

“Down, boy! Down!” Evan cried, as Trigger happily leapt at him. 

And as the dog jumped, he began to shrink. 

“Trigger!” Evan called in astonishment, reaching out to hold the dog. 

Trigger didn’t seem to notice that he was changing. He licked Evan’s face 



as Evan held on tightly. 

In seconds, Trigger was back to normal cocker spaniel size. 

“Look—the glob is shrinking, too!” Andy cried, squeezing Evan’s shoulder. 

Evan turned to see that the green glob was rapidly growing smaller. 

As it shrunk, the Beymer brothers fell to the floor. 

They didn’t move. They lay facedown in a crumpled heap. Their open eyes 
stared lifelessly. They didn’t appear to be breathing. 

Then one blinked. The other blinked. 

Their mouths opened and closed. 

“Ohhh.” One of them uttered a long, low groan. 

Then, pulling themselves up slowly, they both looked around the room, 
dazed. 

The trapped robin had also fallen to the floor. Chirping furiously, it flapped 
its wings wildly and fluttered about the room in a panic—until it found the open 
living room window and sailed out. 

Andy held on to Evan as they stared at the Monster Blood, expecting 
Sarabeth to reappear, too. 

But Sarabeth was gone. 

Vanished. 

The Monster Blood, shrunk to its original size, lay lifeless, inert, a dull 
green spot on the carpet, no bigger than a tennis ball. 

The Beymer brothers stood up uncertainly, their eyes still reflecting terror 
and confusion. They stretched as if testing their arms and legs, seeing if their 
muscles still worked. Then they scrambled out of the house, slamming the screen 
door behind them. 

“It’s over,” Kathryn said softly, moving forward to put an arm around Evan 
and Andy. 

“Sarabeth is gone,” Evan said, holding Trigger tightly in his arms, still 
staring at the tiny wedge of Monster Blood on the floor. 

“And I can hear!” Kathryn said jubilantly, hugging them both. “Sarabeth 
and her spells are gone for good.” 

But as she said this, the screen door swung open and a shadowy figure 
stepped into the living room doorway. 



29 


“Mom!” Evan cried. 

He set down Trigger and hurried to greet her, throwing his arms around her 
in a tight hug. 

“What on earth is going on here?” Mrs. Ross asked. “Why did those two 
boys come bursting out like that? They looked scared to death'.” 

“It—it’s a little hard to explain,” Evan told her. “I’m so glad to see you!” 

Trigger was glad, too. When he finally had finished jumping up and down 
and whimpering, Kathryn led Evan’s mom to the kitchen. “I’ll make some tea,” 
she said. “I have a rather long story to tell you.” 

“I hope it isn’t too long,” Mrs. Ross said, glancing back questioningly at 
Evan. “We have a four o’clock plane to catch.” 

“Mom, I think you’ll find this story interesting,” Evan said, flashing Andy 
an amused look. 

The two women disappeared into the kitchen. 

Andy and Evan dropped down wearily onto the couch. 

“I guess you’re going forever,” Andy said. “I mean, to Atlanta and 
everything—” 

“I’d like to... uh... write to you,” Evan said, suddenly feeling awkward. 

“Yeah. Good,” Andy replied, brightening. “And my dad has a phone credit 
card. Maybe I could get the number and... you know... call you.” 

“Yeah. Great,” Evan said. 

“Could I ask one small favor?” Andy asked. 

“Yeah. Sure,” Evan replied, curious. 

“Well, it’s going to sound strange,” Andy said reluctantly. “But can I... 
uh... can I have the little bit of Monster Blood that’s left? You know. Sort of as a 
memento or something?” 

“Sure. Okay with me,” Evan said. 

They both turned their eyes to where it had come to rest on the carpet. 

“Hey—” Andy cried in surprise. 

It was gone.

AND DIE!

“There’s nothing to do in Pitts Landing,” Michael Warner said, his hands shoved 
into the pockets of his faded denim cutoffs. 

“Yeah. Pitts Landing is the pits,” Greg Banks said. 

Doug Arthur and Shari Walker muttered their agreement. 

Pitts Landing Is The Pits. That was the town slogan, according to Greg and 
his three friends. Actually, Pitts Landing wasn’t much different from a lot of 
small towns with quiet streets of shady lawns and comfortable old houses. 

But here it was, a balmy fall afternoon, and the four friends were hanging 
around Greg’s driveway, kicking at the gravel, wondering what to do for fun and 
excitement. 

“Let’s go to Grover’s and see if the new comic books have come in,” Doug 
suggested. 

“We don’t have any money, Bird,” Greg told him. 

Everyone called Doug “Bird”, because he looked a lot like a bird. A better 
nickname might have been “Stork”. He had long, skinny legs and took long, 
storklike steps. Under his thick tuft of brown hair, which he seldom brushed, he 
had small, birdlike brown eyes and a long nose that curved like a beak. Doug 
didn’t really like being called Bird, but he was used to it. 

“We can still look at the comics,” Bird insisted. 

“Until Grover starts yelling at you,” Shari said. She puffed out her cheeks 
and did a pretty good imitation of the gruff store owner: “Are you paying or 
staying?” 

“He thinks he’s cool,” Greg said, laughing at her imitation. “He’s such a 
jerk.” 

“I think the new X-Force is coming in this week,” Bird said. 

“You should join the X-Force,” Greg said, giving his pal a playful shove. 
“You could be Bird Man. You’d be great!” 

“We should all join the X-Force,” Michael said. “If we were superheroes, 
maybe we’d have something to do.” 

“No, we wouldn’t,” Shari quickly replied. “There’s no crime to fight in Pitts 
Landing.” 

“We could fight crabgrass,” Bird suggested. He was the joker in the group. 



The others laughed. The four of them had been friends for a long time. Greg 
and Shari lived next door to each other, and their parents were best friends. Bird 
and Michael lived on the next block. 

“How about a baseball game?” Michael suggested. “We could go down to 
the playground.” 

“No way,” Shari said. “You can’t play with only four people.” She pushed 
back a strand of her crimped black hair that had fallen over her face. She was 
wearing an oversized yellow sweatshirt over bright green leggings. 

“Maybe we’ll find some other kids there,” Michael said, picking up a 
handful of gravel from the drive and letting it sift through his chubby fingers. 
Michael had short red hair, blue eyes, and a face full of freckles. He wasn’t 
exactly fat, but no one would ever call him skinny. 

“Come on, let’s play baseball,” Bird urged. “I need the practice. My Little 
League starts in a couple of days.” 

“Little League? In the fall?” Shari asked. 

“It’s a new fall league. The first game is Tuesday after school,” Bird 
explained. 

“Hey—we’ll come watch you,” Greg said. 

“We’ll come watch you strike out,” Shari added. Her hobby was teasing 

Bird. 

“What position are you playing?” Greg asked. 

“Backstop,” Michael cracked. 

No one laughed. Michael’s jokes always fell flat. 

Bird shrugged. “Probably the outfield. How come you’re not playing, 
Greg?” 

With his big shoulders and muscular arms and legs, Greg was the natural 
athlete of the group. He was blond and good-looking, with flashing gray-green 
eyes and a wide, friendly smile. 

“My brother, Terry, was supposed to go sign me up, but he forgot,” Greg 
said, making a disgusted face. 

“Where is Terry?” Shari asked. She had a tiny crush on Greg’s older 
brother. 

“He got a job Saturdays and after school. At the Dairy Freeze,” Greg told 
her. 

“Let’s go to the Dairy Freeze!” Michael exclaimed enthusiastically. 

“We don’t have any money—remember?” Bird said glumly. 



“Terry’ll give us free cones,” Michael said, turning a hopeful gaze on Greg. 

“Yeah. Free cones. But no ice cream in them,” Greg told him. “You know 
what a straight arrow my brother is.” 

“This is boring,” Shari complained, watching a robin hop across the 
sidewalk. “It’s boring standing around talking about how bored we are.” 

“We could sit down and talk about how bored we are,” Bird suggested, 
twisting his mouth into the goofy half smile he always wore when he was 
making a dumb joke. 

“Let’s take a walk or a jog or something,” Shari insisted. She made her way 
across the lawn and began walking, balancing her white high-tops on the edge of 
the curb, waving her arms like a high-wire performer. 

The boys followed, imitating her in an impromptu game of follow the 
leader, all of them balancing on the curb edge as they walked. 

A curious cocker spaniel came bursting out of the neighbors’ hedge, 
yapping excitedly. Shari stopped to pet him. The dog, its stub of a tail wagging 
furiously, licked her hand a few times. Then the dog lost interest and disappeared 
back into the hedge. 

The four friends continued down the block, playfully trying to knock each 
other off the curb as they walked. They crossed the street and continued on past 
the school. A couple of guys were shooting baskets, and some little kids played 
kick ball on the practice baseball diamond, but no one they knew. 

The road curved away from the school. They followed it past familiar 
houses. Then, just beyond a small wooded area, they stopped and looked up a 
sloping lawn, the grass uncut for weeks, tall weeds poking out everywhere, the 
shrubs ragged and overgrown. 

At the top of the lawn, nearly hidden in the shadows of enormous old oak 
trees, sprawled a large ramshackle house. The house, anyone could see, had once 
been grand. It was gray shingled, three stories tall, with a wraparound screened 
porch, a sloping red roof, and tall chimneys on either end. But the broken 
windows on the second floor, the cracked, weather-stained shingles, the bare 
spots on the roof, and the shutters hanging loosely beside the dust-smeared 
windows were evidence of the house’s neglect. 

Everyone in Pitts Landing knew it as the Coffman house. Coffman was the 
name painted on the mailbox that tilted on its broken pole over the front walk. 

But the house had been deserted for years—ever since Greg and his friends 
could remember. 



And people liked to tell weird stories about the house: ghost stories and 
wild tales about murders and ghastly things that happened there. Most likely, 
none of them were true. 

“Hey—I know what we can do for excitement,” Michael said, staring up at 
the house bathed in shadows. 

“Huh? What are you talking about?” Greg asked warily. 

“Let’s go into the Coffman house,” Michael said, starting to make his way 
across the weed-choked lawn. 

“Whoa. Are you crazy?” Greg called, hurrying to catch up to him. 

“Let’s go in,” Michael said, his blue eyes catching the light of the late 
afternoon sun filtering down through the tall oak trees. “We wanted an 
adventure. Something a little exciting, right? Come on—let’s check it out.” 

Greg hesitated and stared up at the house. A cold chill ran down his back. 

Before he could reply, a dark form leaped up from the shadows of the tall 
weeds and attacked him! 



2 


Greg toppled backward onto the ground. “Aah!” he screamed. Then he realized 
the others were laughing. 

“It’s that dumb cocker spaniel!” Shari cried. “He followed us!” 

“Go home, dog. Go home!” Bird shooed the dog away. 

The dog trotted to the curb, turned around, and stared back at them, its 
stubby tail wagging furiously. 

Feeling embarrassed that he’d become so frightened, Greg slowly pulled 
himself to his feet, expecting his friends to give him grief. But they were staring 
up at the Coffman house thoughtfully. 

“Yeah, Michael’s right,” Bird said, slapping Michael hard on the back, so 
hard Michael winced and turned to slug Bird. “Let’s see what it’s like in there.” 

“No way,” Greg said, hanging back. “I mean, the place is kind of creepy, 
don’t you think?” 

“So?” Shari challenged him, joining Michael and Bird, who repeated her 
question: “So?” 

“So... I don’t know,” Greg replied. He didn’t like being the sensible one of 
the group. Everyone always made fun of the sensible one. He’d rather be the 
wild and crazy one. But somehow he always ended up sensible. 

“I don’t think we should go in there,” he said, staring up at the neglected 
old house. 

“Are you chicken?” Bird asked. 

“Chicken!” Michael joined in. 

Bird began to cluck loudly, tucking his hands into his armpits and flapping 
his arms. With his beady eyes and beaky nose, he looked just like a chicken. 

Greg didn’t want to laugh, but he couldn’t help it. 

Bird always made him laugh. 

The clucking and flapping seemed to end the discussion. They were 
standing at the foot of the broken concrete steps that led up to the screened 
porch. 

“Look. The window next to the front door is broken,” Shari said. “We can 
just reach in and open the door.” 

“This is cool,” Michael said enthusiastically. 



“Are we really doing this?” Greg, being the sensible one, had to ask. “I 
mean—what about Spidey?” 

Spidey was a weird-looking man of fifty or sixty they’d all seen lurking 
about town. He dressed entirely in black and crept along on long, slender legs. 
He looked just like a black spider, so the kids all called him Spidey. 

Most likely he was homeless or a drifter. No one really knew anything 
about him—where he’d come from, where he lived. But a lot of kids had seen 
him hanging around the Coffman house. 

“Maybe Spidey doesn’t like visitors,” Greg warned. 

But Shari was already reaching in through the broken windowpane to 
unlock the front door. And after little effort, she turned the brass knob and the 
heavy wooden door swung open. 

One by one, they stepped into the front entryway, Greg reluctantly bringing 
up the rear. It was dark inside the house. Only narrow beams of sunlight 
managed to trickle down through the heavy trees in front, creating pale circles of 
light on the worn brown carpet at their feet. 

The floorboards squeaked as Greg and his friends made their way past the 
living room, which was bare except for a couple of overturned grocery store 
cartons against one wall. 

Spidey’s furniture? Greg wondered. 

The living room carpet, as threadbare as the one in the entryway, had a dark 
oval stain in the center of it. Greg and Bird, stopping in the doorway, both 
noticed it at the same time. 

“Think it’s blood?” Bird asked, his tiny eyes lighting up with excitement. 

Greg felt a chill on the back of his neck. “Probably ketchup,” he replied. 
Bird laughed and slapped him hard on the back. 

Shari and Michael were exploring the kitchen. They were staring at the 
dust-covered counter as Greg and Bird stepped up behind them. They saw 
immediately what had captured their attention. Two fat gray mice were standing 
on the counter, staring back at Shari and Michael. 

“They’re cute,” Shari said. “They look just like cartoon mice.” 

The sound of her voice made the two rodents scamper along the counter, 
around the sink, and out of sight. 

“They’re gross,” Michael said, making a disgusted face. “I think they were 
rats—not mice.” 

“Rats have long tails. Mice don’t,” Greg told him. 



“They were definitely rats,” Bird muttered, pushing past them and into the 
hallway. He disappeared toward the front of the house. 

Shari reached up and pulled open a cabinet over the counter. Empty. “I 
guess Spidey never uses the kitchen,” she said. 

“Well, I didn’t think he was a gourmet chef,” Greg joked. 

He followed her into the long, narrow dining room, as bare and dusty as the 
other rooms. A low chandelier still hung from the ceiling, so brown with caked 
dust it was impossible to tell that it was glass. 

“Looks like a haunted house,” Greg said softly. 

“Boo, ” Shari replied. 

“There’s not much to see in here,” Greg complained, following her back to 
the dark hallway. “Unless you get a thrill from dustballs.” 

Suddenly, a loud crack made him jump. 

Shari laughed and squeezed his shoulder. 

“What was that?” he cried, unable to stifle his fear. 

“Old houses do things like that,” she said. “They make noises for no reason 
at all.” 

“I think we should leave,” Greg insisted, embarrassed again that he’d acted 
so frightened. “I mean, it’s boring in here.” 

“It’s kind of exciting being somewhere we’re not supposed to be,” Shari 
said, peeking into a dark, empty room—probably a den or study at one time. 

“I guess,” Greg replied uncertainly. 

They bumped into Michael. “Where’s Bird?” Greg asked. 

“I think he went down to the basement,” Michael replied. 

“Huh? The basement?” 

Michael pointed to an open door at the right of the hallway. “The stairs are 
there.” 

The three of them made their way to the top of the stairs. They peered down 
into the darkness. “Bird?” 

From somewhere deep in the basement, his voice floated up to them in a 
horrified scream: “Help! It’s got me! Somebody—please help! It’s got me!” 



3 


“It’s got me! It’s got me!” 

At the sound of Bird’s terrified cries, Greg pushed past Shari and Michael, 
who stood frozen in openmouthed horror. Practically flying down the steep 
stairway, Greg called out to his friend. “I’m coming, Bird! What is it?” 

His heart pounding, Greg stopped at the bottom of the stairs, every muscle 
tight with fear. His eyes searched frantically through the smoky light pouring in 
from the basement windows up near the ceiling. 

“Bird?” 

There he was, sitting comfortably, calmly, on an overturned metal trash can, 
his legs crossed, a broad smile on his birdlike face. “Gotcha,” he said softly, and 
burst out laughing. 

“What is it? What happened ?” came the frightened voices of Shari and 
Michael. They clamored down the stairs, coming to a stop beside Greg. 

It took them only a few seconds to scope out the situation. 

“Another dumb joke?” Michael asked, his voice still trembling with fear. 

“Bird—were you goofing on us again?” Shari asked, shaking her head. 

Enjoying his moment, Bird nodded, with his peculiar half grin. “You guys 
are too easy,” he scoffed. 

“But, Doug—” Shari started. She only called him Doug when she was upset 
with him. “Haven’t you ever heard of the boy who cried wolf? What if 
something bad happens sometime, and you really need help, and we think you’re 
just goofing?” 

“What could happen?” Bird replied smugly. He stood up and gestured 
around the basement. “Look—it’s brighter down here than upstairs.” 

He was right. Sunlight from the backyard cascaded down through four long 
windows at ground level, near the ceiling of the basement. 

“I still think we should get out of here,” Greg insisted, his eyes moving 
quickly around the large, cluttered room. 

Behind Bird’s overturned trash can stood an improvised table made out of a 
sheet of plywood resting on four paint cans. A nearly flat mattress, dirty and 
stained, rested against the wall, a faded wool blanket folded at the foot. 

“Spidey must live down here!” Michael exclaimed. 



Bird kicked his way through a pile of empty food boxes that had been 
tossed all over the floor—TV dinners, mostly. “Hey, a Hungry Man dinner!” he 
exclaimed. “Where does Spidey heat these up?” 

“Maybe he eats them frozen,” Shari suggested. “You know. Like 
Popsicles.” 

She made her way toward a towering oak wardrobe and pulled open the 
doors. “Wow! This is excellent !” she declared. “Look!” She pulled out a ratty- 
looking fur coat and wrapped it around her shoulders. “Excellent!” she repeated, 
twirling in the old coat. 

From across the room, Greg could see that the wardrobe was stuffed with 
old clothing. Michael and Bird hurried to join Shari and began pulling out 
strange-looking pairs of bell-bottom pants, yellowed dress shirts with pleats 
down the front, tie-dyed neckties that were about a foot wide, and bright-colored 
scarves and bandannas. 

“Hey, guys—” Greg warned. “Don’t you think maybe those belong to 
somebody?” 

Bird spun around, a fuzzy red boa wrapped around his neck and shoulders. 
“Yeah. These are Spidey’s dress-up clothes,” he cracked. 

“Check out this baad hat,” Shari said, turning around to show off the bright 
purple wide-brimmed hat she had pulled on. 

“Neat,” Michael said, examining a long blue cape. “This stuff must be at 
least twenty-five years old. It’s awesome. How could someone just leave it 
here?” 

“Maybe they’re coming back for it,” Greg suggested. 

As his friends explored the contents of the wardrobe, Greg wandered to the 
other end of the large basement. A furnace occupied the far wall, its ducts 
covered in thick cobwebs. Partially hidden by the furnace ducts, Greg could see 
stairs, probably leading to an outside exit. 

Wooden shelves lined the adjoining wall, cluttered with old paint cans, rags, 
newspapers, and rusty tools. 

Whoever lived here must have been a real handyman, Greg thought, 
examining a wooden worktable in front of the shelves. A metal vise was clamped 
to the edge of the worktable. Greg turned the handle, expecting the jaws of the 
vise to open. 

But to his surprise, as he turned the vise handle, a door just above the 
worktable popped open. Greg pulled the door all the way open, revealing a 



hidden cabinet shelf. 

Resting on the shelf was a camera. 



4 


For a long moment, Greg just stared at the camera. 

Something told him the camera was hidden away for a reason. 

Something told him he shouldn’t touch it. He should close the secret door 
and walk away. 

But he couldn’t resist it. 

He reached onto the hidden shelf and took the camera in his hands. 

It pulled out easily. Then, to Greg’s surprise, the door instantly snapped 
shut with a loud bang. 

Weird, he thought, turning the camera in his hands. 

What a strange place to leave a camera. Why would someone put it here? If 
it were valuable enough to hide in a secret cabinet, why didn’t he take it with 
him? 

Greg eagerly examined the camera. It was large and surprisingly heavy, 
with a long lens. Perhaps it’s a telephoto lens, he thought. 

Greg was very interested in cameras. He had an inexpensive automatic 
camera, which took okay snapshots. But he was saving his allowance in hopes of 
buying a really good camera with a lot of lenses. 

He loved looking at camera magazines, studying the different models, 
picking out the ones he wanted to buy. 

Sometimes he daydreamed about traveling around the world, going to 
amazing places, mountaintops and hidden jungle rivers. He’d take photos of 
everything he saw and become a famous photographer. 

His camera at home was just too crummy. That’s why all his pictures came 
out too dark or too light, and everyone in them had glowing red dots in their 
eyes. 

Greg wondered if this camera was any good. 

Raising the viewfinder to his eye, he sighted around the room. He came to a 
stop on Michael, who was wearing two bright yellow feather boas and a white 
Stetson hat and had climbed to the top of the steps to pose. 

“Wait! Hold it!” Greg cried, moving closer, raising the camera to his eye. 
“Let me take your picture, Michael.” 

“Where’d you find that?” Bird asked. 



“Does that thing have film in it?” Michael demanded. 

“I don’t know,” Greg said. “Let’s see.” 

Leaning against the railing, Michael struck what he considered a 
sophisticated pose. 

Greg pointed the camera up and focused carefully. It took a short while for 
his finger to locate the shutter button. “Okay, ready? Say cheese.” 

“Cheddar,” Michael said, grinning down at Greg as he held his pose against 
the railing. 

“Very funny. Michael’s a riot,” Bird said sarcastically. 

Greg centered Michael in the viewfinder frame, then pressed the shutter 
button. 

The camera clicked and flashed. 

Then it made an electronic whirring sound. A slot pulled open on the 
bottom, and a cardboard square slid out. 

“Hey—it’s one of those automatic-developing cameras,” Greg exclaimed. 
He pulled the square of cardboard out and examined it. “Look—the picture is 
starting to develop.” 

“Let me see,” Michael called down, leaning on the railing. 

But before he could start down the stairs, everyone heard a loud crunching 
sound. 

They all looked up to the source of the sound—and saw the railing break 
away and Michael go sailing over the edge. 

“Noooooo!” Michael screamed as he toppled to the floor, arms outstretched, 
the feather boas flying behind him like animal tails. 

He turned in the air, then hit the concrete hard on his back, his eyes frozen 
wide in astonishment and fright. 

He bounced once. 

Then cried out again: “My ankle! Owwww/ My ankle!” He grabbed at the 
injured ankle, then quickly let go with a loud gasp. It hurt too much to touch it. 

“Ohhh —my ankle! ” 

Still holding the camera and the photo, Greg rushed to Michael. Shari and 
Bird did the same. 

“We’ll go get help,” Shari told Michael, who was still on his back, groaning 
in pain. 

But then they heard the ceiling creak. 

Footsteps. Above them. 



Someone was in the house. 

Someone was approaching the basement stairs. 
They were going to be caught. 



5 


The footsteps overhead grew louder. 

The four friends exchanged frightened glances. “We’ve got to get out of 
here,” Shari whispered. 

The ceiling creaked. 

“You can’t leave me here!” Michael protested. He pulled himself to a sitting 
position. 

“Quick—stand up,” Bird instructed. 

Michael struggled to his feet. “I can’t stand on this foot.” His face revealed 
his panic. 

“We’ll help you,” Shari said, turning her eyes to Bird. “I’ll take one arm. 
You take the other.” 

Bird obediently moved forward and pulled Michael’s arm around his 
shoulder. 

“Okay, let’s move!” Shari whispered, supporting Michael from the other 

side. 

“But how do we get out?” Bird asked breathlessly. 

The footsteps grew louder. The ceiling creaked under their weight. 

“We can’t go up the stairs,” Michael whispered, leaning on Shari and Bird. 
“There’s another stairway behind the furnace,” Greg told them, pointing. 

“It leads out?” Michael asked, wincing from his ankle pain. 

“Probably.” 

Greg led the way. “Just pray the door isn’t padlocked or something.” 

“We’re praying. We’re praying!” Bird declared. 

“We’re outta here!” Shari said, groaning under the weight of Michael’s arm. 
Leaning heavily against Shari and Bird, Michael hobbled after Greg, and 
they made their way to the stairs behind the furnace. The stairs, they saw, led to 
wooden double doors up on ground level. 

“I don’t see a padlock,” Greg said warily. “Please, doors—be open!” 

“Hey —who’s down there?” an angry man’s voice called from behind them. 
“It’s—it’s Spidey!” Michael stammered. 

“Hurry!” Shari urged, giving Greg a frightened push. “Come on!” 



Greg set the camera down on the top step. Then he reached up and grabbed 
the handles of the double doors. 

“Who’s down there?” 

Spidey sounded closer, angrier. 

“The doors could be locked from the outside,” Greg whispered, hesitating. 
“Just push them, man!” Bird pleaded. 

Greg took a deep breath and pushed with all his strength. 

The doors didn’t budge. 

“We’re trapped,” he told them. 



6 


“Now what?” Michael whined. 

“Try again,” Bird urged Greg. “Maybe they’re just stuck.” He slid out from 
under Michael’s arm. “Here. I’ll help you.” 

Greg moved over to give Bird room to step up beside him. “Ready?” he 
asked. “One, two, three— push !” 

Both boys pushed against the heavy wooden doors with all their might. 

And the doors swung open. 

“Okay! Now we’re outta here!” Shari declared happily. 

Picking up the camera, Greg led the way out. The backyard, he saw, was as 
weed-choked and overgrown as the front. An enormous limb had fallen off an 
old oak tree, probably during a storm, and was lying half in the tree, half on the 
ground. 

Somehow, Bird and Shari managed to drag Michael up the steps and onto 
the grass. “Can you walk? Try it,” Bird said. 

Still leaning against the two of them, Michael reluctantly pushed his foot 
down on the ground. He lifted it. Then pushed it again. “Hey, it feels a little 
better,” he said, surprised. 

“Then let’s go,” Bird said. 

They ran to the overgrown hedge that edged along the side of the yard, 
Michael on his own now, stepping gingerly on the bad ankle, doing his best to 
keep up. Then, staying in the shadow of the hedge, they made their way around 
the house to the front. 

“All right!” Bird cried happily as they reached the street. “We made it!” 

Gasping for breath, Greg stopped at the curb and turned back toward the 
house. “Look!” he cried, pointing up to the living room window. 

A dark figure stood in the window, hands pressed against the glass. 

“It’s Spidey,” Shari said. 

“He’s just—staring at us,” Michael cried. 

“Weird,” Greg said. “Let’s go.” 

They didn’t stop till they got to Michael’s house, a sprawling redwood ranch- 
style house behind a shady front lawn. 



“How’s the ankle?” Greg asked. 

“It’s loosened up a lot. It doesn’t even hurt that much,” Michael said. 

“Man, you could’ve been killed !” Bird declared, wiping sweat off his 
forehead with the sleeve of his T-shirt. 

“Thanks for reminding me,” Michael said drily. 

“Lucky thing you’ve got all that extra padding,” Bird teased. 

“Shut up,” Michael muttered. 

“Well, you guys wanted adventure,” Shari said, leaning back against the 
trunk of a tree. 

“That guy Spidey is definitely weird,” Bird said, shaking his head. 

“You see the way he was staring at us?” Michael asked. “All dressed in 
black and everything? He looked like some kind of zombie or something.” 

“He saw us,” Greg said softly, suddenly feeling a chill of dread. “He saw us 
very clearly. We’d better stay away from there.” 

“What for?” Michael demanded. “It isn’t his house. He’s just sleeping there. 
We could call the police on him.” 

“But if he’s really crazy or something, there’s no telling what he might do,” 
Greg replied thoughtfully. 

“Aw, he’s not going to do anything,” Shari said quietly. “Spidey doesn’t 
want trouble. He just wants to be left alone.” 

“Yeah,” Michael agreed quickly. “He didn’t want us messing with his stuff. 
That’s why he yelled like that and came after us.” 

Michael was leaning over, rubbing his ankle. “Hey, where’s my picture?” he 
demanded, straightening up and turning to Greg. 

“Huh?” 

“You know. The picture you snapped. With the camera.” 

“Oh. Right.” Greg suddenly realized he still had the camera gripped tightly 
in his hand. He set it down carefully on the grass and reached into his back 
pocket. “I put it in here when we started to run,” he explained. 

“Well? Did it come out?” Michael demanded. 

The three of them huddled around Greg to get a view of the snapshot. 

“Whoa—hold on a minute!” Greg cried, staring hard at the small, square 
photo. “Something’s wrong. What’s going on here?” 



7 


The four friends gaped at the photograph in Greg’s hand, their mouths dropping 
open in surprise. 

The camera had caught Michael in midair as he fell through the broken 
railing to the floor. 

“That’s impossible!” Shari cried. 

“You snapped the picture before I fell!” Michael declared, grabbing the 
photo out of Greg’s hand so that he could study it close up. “I remember it.” 

“You remembered wrong,” Bird said, moving to get another look at it over 
Michael’s shoulder. “You were falling, man. What a great action shot.” He 
picked up the camera. “This is a good camera you stole, Greg.” 

“I didn’t steal it—” Greg started. “I mean, I didn’t realize—” 

“I wasn’t falling!” Michael insisted, tilting the picture in his hand, studying 
it from every angle. “I was posing, remember? I had a big, goofy smile on my 
face, and I was posing.” 

“I remember the goofy smile,” Bird said, handing the camera back to Greg. 
“Do you have any other expression?” 

“You’re not funny, Bird,” Michael muttered. He pocketed the picture. 

“Weird,” Greg said. He glanced at his watch. “Hey—I’ve got to get going.” 

He said good-bye to the others and headed for home. The afternoon sun was 
lowering behind a cluster of palm trees, casting long, shifting shadows over the 
sidewalk. 

He had promised his mother he’d straighten up his room and help with the 
vacuuming before dinner. And now he was late. 

What is that strange car in the driveway? he wondered, jogging across the 
neighbor’s lawn toward his house. 

It was a navy-blue Taurus station wagon. Brand-new. 

Dad picked up our new car! he realized. 

Wow! Greg stopped to admire it. It still had the sticker glued to the door 
window. He pulled open the driver’s door, leaned in, and smelled the vinyl 
upholstery. 

Mmmmmm. That new-car smell. 

He inhaled deeply again. It smelled so good. So fresh and new. 



He closed the door hard, appreciating the solid clunk it made as it closed. 

What a great new car, he thought excitedly. 

He raised the camera to his eye and took a few steps back off the driveway. 

I’ve got to take a picture of this, he thought. To remember what the car was 
like when it was totally new. 

He backed up until he had framed the entire profile of the station wagon in 
the viewfinder. Then he pressed the shutter button. 

As before, the camera clicked loudly, the flash flashed, and with an 
electronic whirr, a square undeveloped photo of gray and yellow slid out of the 
bottom. 

Carrying the camera and the snapshot, Greg ran into the house through the 
front door. “I’m home!” he called. “Down in a minute!” And hurried up the 
carpeted stairs to his room. 

“Greg? Is that you? Your father is home,” his mother called from 
downstairs. 

“I know. Be right down. Sorry I’m late!” Greg shouted back. 

I’d better hide the camera, he decided. If Mom or Dad see it, they’ll want to 
know whose it is and where I got it. And I won’t be able to answer those 
questions. 

“Greg—did you see the new car? Are you coming down?” his mother 
called impatiently from the foot of the stairs. 

“I’m coming!” he yelled. 

His eyes searched frantically for a good hiding place. 

Under his bed? 

No. His mom might vacuum under there and discover it. 

Then Greg remembered the secret compartment in his headboard. He had 
discovered the compartment years ago when his parents had bought him a new 
bedroom set. Quickly, he shoved the camera in. 

Peering into the mirror above his dresser, he gave his blond hair a quick 
brush, rubbed a black soot smudge off his cheek with one hand, then started for 
the door. 

He stopped at the doorway. 

The snapshot of the car. Where had he put it? 

It took a few seconds to remember that he had tossed it onto his bed. 
Curious about how it came out, he turned back to retrieve it. 

“Oh, no!” 



He uttered a low cry as he gazed at the snapshot. 



8 


What’s going on here? Greg wondered. 

He brought the photo up close to his face. 

This isn’t right, he thought. How can this be? 

The blue Taurus station wagon in the photo was a mess. It looked as if it 
had been in a terrible accident. The windshield was shattered. Metal was twisted 
and bent. The door on the driver’s side was caved in. 

The car appeared totaled! 

“This is impossible!” Greg uttered aloud. 

“Greg, where are you?” his mother called. “We’re all hungry, and you’re 
keeping us waiting.” 

“Sorry,” he answered, unable to take his eyes off the snapshot. “Coming.” 

He shoved the photo into his top dresser drawer and made his way 
downstairs. The image of the totaled car burned in his mind. 

Just to make sure, he crossed the living room and peeked out of the front 
window to the driveway. 

There stood the station wagon, sparkling in the glow of the setting sun. 
Shiny and perfect. 

He turned and walked into the dining room, where his brother and his 
parents were already seated. “The new wagon is awesome, Dad,” Greg said, 
trying to shake the snapshot’s image from his thoughts. 

But he kept seeing the twisted metal, the caved-in driver’s door, the 
shattered windshield. 

“After dinner,” Greg’s dad announced happily, “I’m taking you all for a 
drive in the new car!”

“Mmmm. This is great chicken, Mom,” Greg’s brother, Terry, said, chewing as he 
talked. 

“Thanks for the compliment,” Mrs. Banks said drily, “but it’s veal—not 
chicken.” 

Greg and his dad burst out laughing. Terry’s face grew bright red. “Well,” 
he said, still chewing, “it’s such excellent veal, it tastes as good as chicken!” 

“I don’t know why I bother to cook,” Mrs. Banks sighed. 

Mr. Banks changed the subject. “How are things at the Dairy Freeze?” he 
asked. 

“We ran out of vanilla this afternoon,” Terry said, forking a small potato 
and shoving it whole into his mouth. He chewed it briefly, then gulped it down. 
“People were annoyed about that.” 

“I don’t think I can go for the ride,” Greg said, staring down at his dinner, 
which he’d hardly touched. “I mean—” 

“Why not?” his father asked. 

“Well...” Greg searched his mind for a good reason. He needed to make 
one up, but his mind was a blank. 

He couldn’t tell them the truth. 

That he had taken a snapshot of Michael, and it showed Michael falling. 
Then a few seconds later, Michael had fallen. 

And now he had taken a picture of the new car. And the car was wrecked in 
the photo. 

Greg didn’t really know what it meant. But he was suddenly filled with this 
powerful feeling of dread, of fear, of... he didn’t know what. 

A kind of troubled feeling he’d never had before. 

But he couldn’t tell them any of that. It was too weird. Too crazy. 

“I... made plans to go over to Michael’s,” he lied, staring down at his plate. 

“Well, call him and tell him you’ll see him tomorrow,” Mr. Banks said, 
slicing his veal. “That’s no problem.” 

“Well, I’m kind of not feeling very well, either,” Greg said. 

“What’s wrong?” Mrs. Banks asked with instant concern. “Do you have a 
temperature? I thought you looked a little flushed when you came in.” 



“No,” Greg replied uncomfortably. “No temperature. I just feel kind of 
tired, not very hungry.” 

“Can I have your chicken—I mean, veal?” 

Terry asked eagerly. He reached his fork across the table and nabbed the 
cutlet off Greg’s plate. 

“Well, a nice ride might make you feel better,” Greg’s dad said, eyeing 
Greg suspiciously. “You know, some fresh air. You can stretch out in the back if 
you want.” 

“But, Dad—” Greg stopped. He had used up all the excuses he could think 
of. They would never believe him if he said he needed to stay home and do 
homework on a Saturday night! 

“You’re coming with us, and that’s final,” Mr. Banks said, still studying 
Greg closely. “You’ve been dying for this new wagon to arrive. I really don’t 
understand your problem.” 

Neither do I, Greg admitted to himself. 

I don’t understand it at all. Why am I so afraid of riding in the new car? 
Just because there’s something wrong with that stupid camera? 

I’m being silly, Greg thought, trying to shake away the feeling of dread that 
had taken away his appetite. 

“Okay, Dad. Great,” he said, forcing a smile. “I’ll come.” 

“Are there any more potatoes?” Terry asked.

“It’s so easy to drive,” Mr. Banks said, accelerating onto the entry ramp to the 
freeway. “It handles like a small car, not like a station wagon.” 

“Plenty of room back here, Dad,” Terry said, scooting low in the backseat 
beside Greg, raising his knees to the back of the front seat. 

“Hey, look—there’s a drink holder that pulls out from the dash!” Greg’s 
mother exclaimed. “That’s neat.” 

“Awesome, Mom,” Terry said sarcastically. 

“Well, we never had a drink holder before,” Mrs. Banks replied. She turned 
back to the two boys. “Are your seat belts buckled? Do they work properly?” 

“Yeah. They’re okay,” Terry replied. 

“They checked them at the showroom before I took the car,” Mr. Banks 
said, signaling to move into the left lane. 

A truck roared by, spitting a cloud of exhaust behind it. Greg stared out the 
front window. His door window was still covered by the new-car sticker. 

Mr. Banks pulled off the freeway onto a nearly empty four-lane highway 
that curved toward the west. The setting sun was a red ball low on the horizon in 
a charcoal-gray sky. 

“Put the pedal to the metal, Dad,” Terry urged, sitting up and leaning 
forward. “Let’s see what this car can do.” 

Mr. Banks obediently pressed his foot on the accelerator. “The cruising 
speed seems to be about sixty,” he said. 

“Slow down,” Mrs. Banks scolded. “You know the speed limit is fifty-five.” 

“I’m just testing it,” Greg’s dad said defensively. “You know. Making sure 
the transmission doesn’t slip or anything.” 

Greg stared at the glowing speedometer. They were doing seventy now. 

“Slow down. I mean it,” Mrs. Banks insisted. “You’re acting like a crazy 
teenager.” 

“That’s me!” Mr. Banks replied, laughing. “This is awesome !” he said, 
imitating Terry, ignoring his wife’s pleas to slow down. 

They roared past a couple of small cars in the right lane. Headlights of cars 
moving toward them were a bright white blur in the darkening evening. 

“Hey, Greg, you’ve been awfully quiet,” his mother said. “You feeling 



okay?” 

“Yeah. I’m okay,” Greg said softly. 

He wished his dad would slow down. He was doing seventy-five now. 

“What do you think, Greg?” Mr. Banks asked, steering with his left hand as 
his right hand searched the dashboard. “Where’s the light switch? I should turn 
on my headlights.” 

“The car’s great,” Greg replied, trying to sound enthusiastic. But he 
couldn’t shake away the fear, couldn’t get the photo of the mangled car out of his 
mind. 

“Where’s that stupid light switch? It’s got to be here somewhere,” Mr. 
Banks said. 

As he glanced down at the unfamiliar dashboard, the station wagon swerved 
to the left. 

“Dad—look out for that truck! ” Greg screamed. 



11 


Horns blared. 

A powerful blast of air swept over the station wagon, like a giant ocean 
wave pushing it to the side. 

Mr. Banks swerved the station wagon to the right. 

The truck rumbled past. 

“Sorry,” Greg’s dad said, eyes straight ahead, slowing the car to sixty, fifty- 
five, fifty... 

“I told you to slow down,” Mrs. Banks scolded, shaking her head. “We 
could’ve been killed!” 

“I was trying to find the lights,” he explained. “Oh. Here they are. On the 
steering wheel.” He clicked on the headlights. 

“You boys okay?” Mrs. Banks asked, turning to check them out. 

“Yeah. Fine,” Terry said, sounding a little shaken. The truck would have hit 
his side of the car. 

“I’m okay,” Greg said. “Can we go back now?” 

“Don’t you want to keep going?” Mr. Banks asked, unable to hide his 
disappointment. “I thought we’d keep going to Santa Clara. Stop and get some 
ice cream or something.” 

“Greg’s right,” Mrs. Banks said softly to her husband. “Enough for tonight, 
dear. Let’s turn around.” 

“The truck didn’t come that close,” Mr. Banks argued. But he obediently 
turned off the highway and they headed for home. 

Later, safe and sound up in his room, Greg took the photograph out of his 
dresser and examined it. There was the new station wagon, the driver’s side 
caved in, the windshield shattered. 

“Weird,” he said aloud, and placed the photo in the secret compartment in 
his headboard, where he had stashed the camera. “Definitely weird.” 

He pulled the camera out of its hiding place and turned it around in his 
hands. 

I’ll try it one more time, he decided. 

He walked to his dresser and aimed at the mirror above it. 

I’ll take a picture of myself in the mirror, he thought. 



He raised the camera, then changed his mind. That won’t work, he realized. 
The flash will reflect back and spoil the photo. 

Gripping the camera in one hand, he made his way across the hall to Terry’s 
room. His brother was at his desk, typing away on his computer keyboard, his 
face bathed in the blue light of the monitor screen. 

“Terry, can I take your picture?” Greg asked meekly, holding up the camera. 

Terry typed some more, then looked up from the screen. “Hey—where’d 
you get the camera?” 

“Uh... Shari loaned it to me,” Greg told him, thinking quickly. Greg didn’t 
like to lie. But he didn’t feel like explaining to Terry how he and his friends had 
sneaked into the Coffman house and how he had made off with the camera. 

“So can I take your picture?” Greg asked. 

“I’ll probably break your camera,” Terry joked. 

“I think it’s already broken,” Greg told him. “That’s why I want to test it on 
you.” 

“Go ahead,” Terry said. He stuck out his tongue and crossed his eyes. 

Greg snapped the shutter. An undeveloped photo slid out of the slot in front. 

“Thanks. See you.” Greg headed to the door. 

“Hey—don’t I get to see it?” Terry called after him. 

“If it comes out,” Greg said, and hurried across the hall to his room. 

He sat down on the edge of the bed. Holding the photo in his lap, he stared 
at it intently as it developed. The yellows filled in first. Then the reds appeared, 
followed by shades of blue. 

“Whoa,” Greg muttered, as his brother’s face came into view. “There’s 
something definitely wrong here.” 

In the photo, Terry’s eyes weren’t crossed, and his tongue wasn’t sticking 
out. His expression was grim, frightened. He looked very upset. 

As the background came into focus, Greg had another surprise. Terry 
wasn’t in his room. He was outdoors. There were trees in the background. And a 
house. 

Greg stared at the house. It looked so familiar. 

Was that the house across the street from the playground? 

He took one more look at Terry’s frightened expression. Then he tucked the 
photo and the camera into his secret headboard compartment and carefully 
closed it. 

The camera must be broken, he decided, getting changed for bed. 



It was the best explanation he could come up with. 

Lying in bed, staring up at the shifting shadows on the ceiling, he decided 
not to think about it anymore. 

A broken camera wasn’t worth worrying about. 


* * * 


Tuesday afternoon after school, Greg hurried to meet Shari at the playground to 
watch Bird’s Little League game. 

It was a warm fall afternoon, the sun high in a cloudless sky. The outfield 
grass had been freshly mowed and filled the air with its sharp, sweet smell. 

Greg crossed the grass and squinted into the bright sunlight, searching for 
Shari. Both teams were warming up on the sides of the diamond, yelling and 
laughing, the sound of balls popping into gloves competing with their loud 
voices. 

A few parents and several kids had come to watch. Some were standing 
around, some sitting in the low bleachers along the first-base line. 

Greg spotted Shari behind the backstop and waved to her. “Did you bring 
the camera?” she asked eagerly, running over to greet him. 

He held it up. 

“Excellent,” she exclaimed, grinning. She reached for it. 

“I think it’s broken,” Greg said, holding on to the camera. “The photos just 
don’t come out right. It’s hard to explain.” 

“Maybe it’s not the photos. Maybe it’s the photographer,” Shari teased. 

“Maybe I’ll take a photo of you getting a knuckle sandwich,” Greg 
threatened. He raised the camera to his eye and pointed it at her. 

“Snap that, and I’ll take a picture of you eating the camera,” Shari 
threatened playfully. She reached up quickly and pulled the camera from his 
hand. 

“What do you want it for, anyway?” Greg asked, making a halfhearted 
attempt to grab it back. 

Shari held it away from his outstretched hand. “I want to take Bird’s picture 
when he comes up to bat. He looks just like an ostrich at the plate.” 

“I heard that.” Bird appeared beside them, pretending to be insulted. 

He looked ridiculous in his starched white uniform. The shirt was too big, 
and the pants were too short. The cap was the only thing that fit. It was blue, 



with a silver dolphin over the bill and the words PITTS LANDING DOLPHINS. 

“What kind of name is Dolphins for a baseball team?” Greg asked, 
grabbing the bill and turning the cap backward on Bird’s head. 

“All the other caps were taken,” Bird answered. “We had a choice between 
the Zephyrs and the Dolphins. None of us knew what zephyrs were, so we 
picked Dolphins.” 

Shari eyed him up and down. “Maybe you guys should play in your street 
clothes.” 

“Thanks for the encouragement,” Bird replied. He spotted the camera and 
took it from her. “Hey, you brought the camera. Does it have film?” 

“Yeah. I think so,” Greg told him. “Let me see.” He reached for the camera, 
but Bird swung it out of his grasp. 

“Hey—are you going to share this thing, Greg?” he asked. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” Greg reached again for the camera, and again 
Bird swung it away from him. 

“I mean, we all risked our lives down in that basement getting it, right?” 
Bird said. “We should all share it.” 

“Well...” Greg hadn’t thought about it. “I guess you’re right, Bird. But I’m 
the one who found it. So—” 

Shari grabbed the camera out of Bird’s hand. “I told Greg to bring it so we 
could take your picture when you’re up.” 

“As an example of good form?” Bird asked. 

“As a bad example,” Shari said. 

“You guys are just jealous,” Bird replied, frowning, “because I’m a natural 
athlete, and you can’t cross the street without falling on your face.” He turned 
the cap back around to face the front. 

“Hey, Bird—get back here!” one of the coaches called from the playing 

field. 

“I’ve got to go,” Bird said, giving them a quick wave and starting to trot 
back to his teammates. 

“No. Wait. Let me take a fast picture now,” Greg said. 

Bird stopped, turned around, and struck a pose. 

“No. I’ll take it,” Shari insisted. 

She started to raise the camera to her eye, pointing it toward Bird. And as 
she raised it, Greg grabbed for it. 

“Let me take it!” 



And the camera went off. Clicked and then flashed. 

An undeveloped photo slid out. 

“Hey, why’d you do that?” Shari asked angrily. 

“Sorry,” Greg said. “I didn’t mean to—” 

She pulled the photo out and held it in her hand. Greg and Bird came close 
to watch it develop. 

“What the heck is that?” Bird cried, staring hard at the small square as the 
colors brightened and took shape. 

“Oh, wow!” Greg cried. 

The photo showed Bird sprawled unconscious on his back on the ground, 
his mouth twisted open, his neck bent at a frightening angle, his eyes shut tight.

“Hey—what’s with this stupid camera?” Bird asked, grabbing the snapshot out 
of Shari’s hand. He tilted it from side to side, squinting at it. “It’s out of focus or 
something.” 

“Weird,” Greg said, shaking his head. 

“Hey, Bird—get over here!” the Dolphins’ coach called. 

“Coming!” Bird handed the picture back to Shari and jogged over to his 
teammates. 

Whistles blew. The two teams stopped their practicing and trotted to the 
benches along the third-base line. 

“How did this happen?” Shari asked Greg, shielding her eyes from the sun 
with one hand, holding the photo close to her face with the other. “It really looks 
like Bird is lying on the ground, knocked out or something. But he was standing 
right in front of us.” 

“I don’t get it. I really don’t,” Greg replied thoughtfully. “The camera keeps 
doing that.” 

Carrying the camera at his side, swinging it by its slender strap, he followed 
her to a shady spot beside the bleachers. 

“Look how his neck is bent,” Shari continued. “It’s so awful.” 

“There’s something definitely wrong with the camera,” Greg said. He 
started to tell her about the snapshot he took of the new station wagon, and the 
snapshot of his brother, Terry. But she interrupted him before he could get the 
words out. 

“And that picture of Michael. It showed him falling down the stairs before 
he even fell. It’s just so strange.” 

“I know,” Greg agreed. 

“Let me see that thing,” Shari said, and pulled the camera from his hand. 
“Is there any film left?” 

“I can’t tell,” Greg admitted. “I couldn’t find a film counter or anything.” 

Shari examined the camera closely, rolling it over in her hands. “It doesn’t 
say anywhere. How can you tell if it’s loaded or not?” 

Greg shrugged. 

The baseball game got under way. The Dolphins were the visiting team. 



The other team, the Cardinals, jogged out to take their positions on the field. 

A kid in the bleachers dropped his soda can. It hit the ground and spilled, 
and the kid started to cry. An old station wagon filled with teenagers cruised by, 
its radio blaring, its horn honking. 

“Where do you put the film in?” Shari asked impatiently. 

Greg stepped closer to help her examine it. “Here, I think,” he said, 
pointing. “Doesn’t the back come off?” 

Shari fiddled with it. “No, I don’t think so. Most of these automatic- 
developing cameras load in the front.” 

She pulled at the back, but the camera wouldn’t open. She tried pulling off 
the bottom. No better luck. Turning the camera, she tried pulling off the lens. It 
wouldn’t budge. 

Greg took the camera from her. “There’s no slot or opening in the front.” 

“Well, what kind of camera is it, anyway?” Shari demanded. 

“Uh... let’s see.” Greg studied the front, examined the top of the lens, then 
turned the camera over and studied the back. 

He stared up at her with a surprised look on his face. “There’s no brand 
name. Nothing.” 

“How can a camera not have a name?” Shari shouted in exasperation. She 
snatched the camera away from him and examined it closely, squinting against 
the bright afternoon sunshine. 

Finally, she handed the camera back to him, defeated. “You’re right, Greg. 
No name. No words of any kind. Nothing. What a stupid camera,” she added 
angrily. 

“Whoa. Hold on,” Greg told her. “It’s not my camera, remember? I didn’t 
buy it. I took it from the Coffman house.” 

“Well, let’s at least figure out how to open it up and look inside,” Shari said. 

The first Dolphin batter popped up to the second baseman. The second 
batter struck out on three straight swings. The dozen or so spectators shouted 
encouragement to their team. 

The little kid who had dropped his soda continued to cry. Three kids rode 
by on bikes, waving to friends on the teams but not stopping to watch. 

“I’ve tried and tried, but I can’t figure out how to open it,” Greg admitted. 

“Give it to me,” Shari said, and grabbed the camera away from him. “There 
has to be a button or something. There has to be some way of opening it. This is 
ridiculous.” 



When she couldn’t find a button or lever of any kind, she tried pulling the 
back off once again, prying it with her fingernails. Then she tried turning the 
lens, but it wouldn’t turn. 

“I’m not going to stop trying,” she said, gritting her teeth. “This camera has 
to open. It has to!” 

“Give up. You’re going to wreck it,” Greg warned, reaching for it. 

“Wreck it? How could I wreck it?” Shari demanded. “It has no moving 
parts. Nothing!” 

“This is impossible,” Greg said. 

Making a disgusted face, she handed the camera to him. “Okay, I give up. 
Check it out yourself, Greg.” 

He took the camera, started to raise it to his face, then stopped. 

Uttering a low cry of surprise, his mouth dropped open and his eyes gaped 
straight ahead. Startled, Shari turned to follow his shocked gaze. 

“Oh, no!” 

There on the ground, a few yards outside the first-base line, lay Bird. He 
was sprawled on his back, his neck bent at an odd and unnatural angle, his eyes 
shut tight.

“Bird!” Shari cried. 

Greg’s breath caught in his throat. He felt as if he were choking. “Oh!” he 
finally managed to cry out in a shrill, raspy voice. 

Bird didn’t move. 

Shari and Greg, running side by side at full speed, reached him together. 

“Bird?” Shari knelt down beside him. “Bird?” 

Bird opened one eye. “Gotcha,” he said quietly. The weird half smile 
formed on his face, and he exploded in high-pitched laughter. 

It took Shari and Greg a while to react. They both stood openmouthed, 
gaping at their laughing friend. 

Then, his heart beginning to slow to normal, Greg reached down, grabbed 
Bird with both hands, and pulled him roughly to his feet. 

“I’ll hold him while you hit him,” Greg offered, holding Bird from behind. 

“Hey, wait—” Bird protested, struggling to squirm out of Greg’s grasp. 

“Good plan,” Shari said, grinning. 

“Ow! Hey—let go! Come on! Let go!” Bird protested, trying 
unsuccessfully to wrestle free. “Come on! What’s your problem? It was a joke, 
guys.” 

“Very funny,” Shari said, giving Bird a playful punch on the shoulder. 
“You’re a riot, Bird.” 

Bird finally freed himself with a hard tug and danced away from both of 
them. “I just wanted to show you how bogus it is to get all worked up about that 
dumb camera.” 

“But, Bird—” Greg started. 

“It’s just broken, that’s all,” Bird said, brushing blades of recently cut grass 
off his uniform pants. “You think because it showed Michael falling down those 
stairs, there’s something strange with it. But that’s dumb. Real dumb.” 

“I know it,” Greg replied sharply. “But how do you explain it?” 

“I told you, man. It’s wrecked. Broken. That’s it.” 

“Bird—get over here!” a voice called, and Bird’s fielder’s glove came 
flying at his head. He caught it, waved with a grin to Shari and Greg, and jogged 
to the outfield along with the other members of the Dolphins. 



Carrying the camera tightly in one hand, Greg led the way to the bleachers. 
He and Shari sat down on the end of the bottom bench. 

Some of the spectators had lost interest in the game already and had left. A 
few kids had taken a baseball off the field and were having their own game of 
catch behind the bleachers. Across the playground, four or five kids were getting 
a game of kickball started. 

“Bird is such a dork,” Greg said, his eyes on the game. 

“He scared me to death,” Shari exclaimed. “I really thought he was hurt.” 

“What a clown,” Greg muttered. 

They watched the game in silence for a while. It wasn’t terribly interesting. 
The Dolphins were losing 12-3 going into the third inning. None of the players 
were very good. 

Greg laughed as a Cardinal batter slugged a ball that sailed out to the field 
and right over Bird’s head. 

“That’s the third ball that flew over his head!” Greg cried. 

“Guess he lost it in the sun!” Shari exclaimed, joining in the laughter. 

They both watched Bird’s long legs storking after the ball. By the time he 
managed to catch up with it and heave it toward the diamond, the Cardinal had 
already rounded the bases and scored. 

There were loud boos from the bleachers. 

The next Cardinal batter stepped to the plate. A few more kids climbed 
down from the bleachers, having seen enough. 

“It’s so hot here in the sun,” Shari said, shielding her eyes with one hand. 
“And I’ve got lots of homework. Want to leave?” 

“I just want to see the next inning,” Greg said, watching the batter swing 
and miss. “Bird is coming up next inning. I want to stay and boo him.” 

“What are friends for?” Shari said sarcastically. 

It took a long while for the Dolphins to get the third out. The Cardinals 
batted around their entire order. 

Greg’s T-shirt was drenched with sweat by the time Bird came up to the 
plate in the top of the fourth. 

Despite the loud booing from Shari and Greg, Bird managed to punch the 
ball past the shortstop for a single. 

“Lucky hit!” Greg yelled, cupping his hands into a megaphone. 

Bird pretended not to hear him. He tossed away his batter’s helmet, 
adjusted his cap, and took a short lead off first base. 



The next batter swung at the first pitch and fouled it off. 

“Let’s go,” Shari urged, pulling Greg’s arm. “It’s too hot. I’m dying of 
thirst.” 

“Let’s just see if Bird—” 

Greg didn’t finish his sentence. 

The batter hit the next ball hard. It made a loud thunk as it left the bat. 

A dozen people—players and spectators—cried out as the ball flew across 
the diamond, a sharp line drive, and slammed into the side of Bird’s head with 
another thunk. 

Greg watched in horror as the ball bounced off Bird and dribbled away onto 
the infield grass. Bird’s eyes went wide with disbelief, confusion. 

He stood frozen in place on the base path for a long moment. 

Then both of his hands shot up above his head, and he uttered a shrill cry, 
long and loud, like the high-pitched whinny of a horse. 

His eyes rolled up in his head. He sank to his knees and uttered another cry, 
softer this time. Then he collapsed, sprawling onto his back, his neck at an 
unnatural angle, his eyes closed. 

He didn’t move.

In seconds, the two coaches and both teams were running out to the fallen player, 
huddling over him, forming a tight, hushed circle around him. 

Crying “Bird! Bird!” Shari leaped off the bleachers and began running to 
the circle of horrified onlookers. 

Greg started to follow but stopped when he saw a familiar figure crossing 
the street at a full run, waving to him. 

“Terry!” Greg cried. 

Why was his brother coming to the playground? Why wasn’t he at his after¬ 
school job at the Dairy Freeze? 

“Terry? What’s happening?” Greg cried. 

Terry stopped, gasping for breath, sweat pouring down his bright red 
forehead. “I... ran... all... the... way,” he managed to utter. 

“Terry, what’s wrong?” A sick feeling crept up from Greg’s stomach. 

As Terry approached, his face held the same frightened expression as in the 
photograph Greg had snapped of him. 

The same frightened expression. With the same house behind him across 
the street. 

The snapshot had come true. Just as the snapshot of Bird lying on the 
ground had come true. 

Greg’s throat suddenly felt as dry as cotton. He realized that his knees were 
trembling. 

“Terry, what is it?” he managed to cry. 

“It’s Dad,” Terry said, putting a heavy hand on Greg’s shoulder. 

“Huh? Dad?” 

“You’ve got to come home, Greg. Dad—he’s been in a bad accident.” 

“An accident?” Greg’s head spun. Terry’s words weren’t making any sense 
to him. 

“In the new car,” Terry explained, again placing a heavy hand on Greg’s 
trembling shoulder. “The new car is totaled. Completely totaled.” 

“Oh,” Greg gasped, feeling weak. 

Terry squeezed his shoulder. “Come on. Hurry.” 



Holding the camera tightly in one hand, Greg began running after his 
brother. 

Reaching the street, he turned back to the playground to see what was 
happening with Bird. 

A large crowd was still huddled around Bird, blocking him from sight. 

But—what was that dark shadow behind the bleachers? Greg wondered. 
Someone—someone all in black—was hiding back there. 

Watching Greg? 

“Come on!” Terry urged. 

Greg stared hard at the bleachers. The dark figure pulled back out of sight. 
“Come on, Greg!” 

“I’m coming!” Greg shouted, and followed his brother toward home. 



15 


The hospital walls were pale green. The uniforms worn by the nurses scurrying 
through the brightly lit corridors were white. The floor tiles beneath Greg’s feet, 
as he hurried with his brother toward their father’s room, were dark brown with 
orange specks. 

Colors. 

All Greg could see were blurs of colors, indistinct shapes. 

His sneakers thudded noisily against the hard tile floor. He could barely 
hear them over the pounding of his heart. 

Totaled. The car had been totaled. 

Just like in the snapshot. 

Greg and Terry turned a corner. The walls in this corridor were pale yellow. 
Terry’s cheeks were red. Two doctors passed by wearing lime-green surgical 
gowns. 

Colors. Only colors. 

Greg blinked, tried to see clearly. But it was all passing by too fast, all too 
unreal. Even the sharp hospital smell, that unique aroma of rubbing alcohol, stale 
food, and disinfectant, couldn’t make it real for him. 

Then the two brothers entered their father’s room, and it all became real. 

The colors faded. The images became sharp and clear. 

Their mother jumped up from the folding chair beside the bed. “Hi, boys.” 
She clenched a wadded-up tissue in her hand. It was obvious that she had been 
crying. She forced a tight smile on her face, but her eyes were red-rimmed, her 
cheeks pale and puffy. 

Stopping just inside the doorway of the small room, Greg returned his 
mother’s greeting in a soft, choked voice. Then his eyes, focusing clearly now, 
turned to his father. 

Mr. Banks had a mummylike bandage covering his hair. One arm was in a 
cast. The other lay at his side and had a tube attached just above the wrist, 
dripping a dark liquid into the arm. The bedsheet was pulled up to his chest. 

“Hey—how’s it going, guys?” their father asked. His voice sounded fogged 
in, as if coming from far away. 

“Dad—” Terry started. 



“He’s going to be okay,” Mrs. Banks interrupted, seeing the frightened 
looks on her sons’ faces. 

“I feel great,” Mr. Banks said groggily. 

“You don’t look so great,” Greg blurted out, stepping up cautiously to the 

bed. 

“I’m okay. Really,” their father insisted. “A few broken bones. That’s it.” 
He sighed, then winced from pain. “I guess I’m lucky.” 

“You’re very lucky,” Mrs. Banks agreed quickly. 

What’s the lucky part? Greg wondered silently to himself. He couldn’t take 
his eyes off the tube stuck into his father’s arm. 

Again, he thought of the snapshot of the car. It was up in his room at home, 
tucked into the secret compartment in his headboard. 

The snapshot showing the car totaled, the driver’s side caved in. 

Should he tell them about it? 

He couldn’t decide. 

Would they believe him if he did tell them? 

“What’d you break, Dad?” Terry asked, sitting down on the radiator in front 
of the windowsill, shoving his hands into his jeans pockets. 

“Your father broke his arm and a few ribs,” Mrs. Banks answered quickly. 
“And he had a slight concussion. The doctors are watching him for internal 
injuries. But so far, so good.” 

“I was lucky,” Mr. Banks repeated. He smiled at Greg. 

“Dad, I have to tell you about this photo I took,” Greg said suddenly, 
speaking rapidly, his voice trembling with nervousness. “I took a picture of the 
new car, and—” 

“The car is completely wrecked,” Mrs. Banks interrupted. Sitting on the 
edge of the folding chair, she rubbed her fingers, working her wedding ring 
around and around, something she always did when she was nervous. “I’m glad 
you boys didn’t see it.” Her voice caught in her throat. Then she added, “It’s a 
miracle he wasn’t hurt any worse.” 

“This photo—” Greg started again. 

“Later,” his mother said brusquely. “Okay?” She gave him a meaningful 
stare. 

Greg felt his face grow hot. 

This is important, he thought. 

Then he decided they probably wouldn’t believe him, anyway. Who would 



believe such a crazy story? 

“Will we be able to get another new car?” Terry asked. 

Mr. Banks nodded carefully. “I have to call the insurance company,” he 

said. 

“ITl call them when I get home,” Mrs. Banks said. “You don’t exactly have 
a hand free.” 

Everyone laughed at that, nervous laughter. 

“I feel kind of sleepy,” Mr. Banks said. His eyes were halfway closed, his 
voice muffled. 

“It’s the painkillers the doctors gave you,” Mrs. Banks told him. She leaned 
forward and patted his hand. “Get some sleep. I’ll come back in a few hours.” 

She stood up, still fiddling with her wedding band, and motioned with her 
head toward the door. 

“Bye, Dad,” Greg and Terry said in unison. 

Their father muttered a reply. They followed their mother out the door. 

“What happened?” Terry asked, as they made their way past a nurses’ 
station, then down the long, pale yellow corridor. “I mean, the accident.” 

“Some guy ran right through a red light,” Mrs. Banks said, her red-rimmed 
eyes focused straight ahead. “He plowed right into your father’s side of the car. 
Said his brakes weren’t working.” She shook her head, tears forming in the 
corners of her eyes. “I don’t know,” she said, sighing. “I just don’t know what to 
say. Thank goodness he’s going to be okay.” 

They turned into the green corridor, walking side by side. Several people 
were waiting patiently for the elevator at the far end of the hall. 

Once again, Greg found himself thinking of the snapshots he had taken with 
the weird camera. 

First Michael. Then Terry. Then Bird. Then his father. 

All four photos had shown something terrible. Something terrible that 
hadn’t happened yet. 

And then all four photos had come true. 

Greg felt a chill as the elevator doors opened and the small crowd of people 
moved forward to squeeze inside. 

What’s the truth about the camera? he wondered. 

Does the camera show the future ? 

Or does it actually cause bad things to happen? 



16 


“Yeah. I know Bird’s okay,” Greg said into the phone receiver. “I saw him 
yesterday, remember? He was lucky. Real lucky. He didn’t have a concussion or 
anything.” 

On the other end of the line—in the house next door—Shari agreed, then 
repeated her request. 

“No, Shari. I really don’t want to,” Greg replied vehemently. 

“Bring it,” Shari demanded. “It’s my birthday.” 

“I don’t want to bring the camera. It’s not a good idea. Really,” Greg told 
her. 

It was the next weekend. Saturday afternoon. Greg had been nearly out the 
door, on his way to Shari’s birthday party, when the phone rang. 

“Hi, Greg. Why aren’t you on your way to my party?” Shari had asked 
when he’d run to pick up the receiver. 

“Because I’m on the phone with you,” Greg had replied drily. 

“Well, bring the camera, okay?” 

Greg hadn’t looked at the camera, hadn’t removed it from its hiding place 
since his father’s accident. 

“I don’t want to bring it,” he insisted, despite Shari’s high-pitched demands. 
“Don’t you understand, Shari? I don’t want anyone else to get hurt.” 

“Oh, Greg,” she said, talking to him as if he were a three-year-old. “You 
don’t really believe that, do you? You don’t really believe that camera can hurt 
people.” 

Greg was silent for a moment. “I don’t know what I believe,” he said 
finally. “I only know that first, Michael, then, Bird—” 

Greg swallowed hard. “And I had a dream, Shari. Last night.” 

“Huh? What kind of dream?” Shari asked impatiently. 

“It was about the camera. I was taking everyone’s picture. My whole family 
—Mom, Dad, and Terry. They were barbecuing. In the backyard. I held up the 
camera. I kept saying, ‘Say cheese, say cheese,’ over and over. And when I 
looked through the viewfinder, they were smiling back at me—but... they were 
skeletons. All of them. Their skin was gone, and—and...” 

Greg’s voice trailed off. 



“What a dumb dream,” Shari said, laughing. 

“But that’s why I don’t want to bring the camera,” Greg insisted. “I think 

55 

“Bring it, Greg,” she interrupted. “It’s not your camera, you know. All four 
of us were in the Coffman house. It belongs to all four of us. Bring it.” 

“But why, Shari?” Greg demanded. 

“It’ll be a goof, that’s all. It takes such weird pictures.” 

“That’s for sure,” Greg muttered. 

“We don’t have anything else to do for my party,” Shari told him. “I wanted 
to rent a video, but my mom says we have to go outdoors. She doesn’t want her 
precious house messed up. So I thought we could take everyone’s picture with 
the weird camera. You know. See what strange things come out.” 

“Shari, I really don’t—” 

“Bring it,” she ordered. And hung up. 

Greg stood for a long time staring at the phone receiver, thinking hard, 
trying to decide what to do. 

Then he replaced the receiver and headed reluctantly up to his room. 

With a loud sigh, he pulled the camera from its hiding place in his 
headboard. “It’s Shari’s birthday, after all,” he said aloud to himself. 

His hands were trembling as he picked it up. He realized he was afraid of it. 

Ishouldn’t be doing this, he thought, feeling a heavy knot of dread in the pit 
of his stomach. 

I know I shouldn’t be doing this.

“How’s it going, Bird?” Greg called, making his way across the flagstone patio 
to Shari’s backyard. 

“I’m feeling okay,” Bird said, slapping his friend a high five. “The only 
problem is, ever since that ball hit me,” Bird continued, frowning, “from time to 
time I start —pluuccck cluuuck cluuuuck !—clucking like a chicken!” He flapped 
his arms and started strutting across the backyard, clucking at the top of his 
voice. 

“Hey, Bird—go lay an egg!” someone yelled, and everyone laughed. 

“Bird’s at it again,” Michael said, shaking his head. He gave Greg a friendly 
punch on the shoulder. Michael, his red hair unbrushed as usual, was wearing 
faded jeans and a flowered Hawaiian sports shirt about three sizes too big for 
him. 

“Where’d you get that shirt?” Greg asked, holding Michael at arm’s length 
by the shoulders to admire it. 

“In a cereal box,” Bird chimed in, still flapping his arms. 

“My grandmother gave it to me,” Michael said, frowning. 

“He made it in home ec,” Bird interrupted. One joke was never enough. 

“But why did you wear it?” Greg asked. 

Michael shrugged. “Everything else was dirty.” 

Bird bent down, picked up a small clump of dirt from the lawn, and rubbed 
it on the back of Michael’s shirt. “Now this one’s dirty, too,” he declared. 

“Hey, you—” Michael reacted with playful anger, grabbing Bird and 
shoving him into the hedge. 

“Did you bring it?” 

Hearing Shari’s voice, Greg turned toward the house and saw her jogging 
across the patio in his direction. Her black hair was pulled back in a single braid, 
and she had on an oversized silky yellow top that came down over black spandex 
leggings. 

“Did you bring it?” she repeated eagerly. A charm bracelet filled with tiny 
silver charms—a birthday present—jangled at her wrist. 

“Yeah.” Greg reluctantly held up the camera. 

“Excellent,” she declared. 



“I really don’t want—” Greg started. 

“You can take my picture first since it’s my birthday,” Shari interrupted. 
“Here. How’s this?” She struck a sophisticated pose, leaning against a tree with 
her hand behind her head. 

Greg obediently raised the camera. “Are you sure you want to do this, 
Shari?” 

“Yeah. Come on. I want to take everyone’s picture.” 

“But it’ll probably come out weird,” Greg protested. 

“I know,” Shari replied impatiently, holding her pose. “That’s the fun of it.” 

“But, Shari—” 

“Michael puked on his shirt,” he heard Bird telling someone near the hedge. 

“I did not!” Michael was screaming. 

“You mean it looks like that naturally?” Bird, asked. 

Greg could hear a lot of raucous laughing, all of it at Michael’s expense. 

“Will you take the picture?” Shari cried, holding on to the slender trunk of 
the tree. 

Greg pointed the lens at her and pressed the button. The camera whirred, 
and the undeveloped white square rolled out. 

“Hey, are we the only boys invited?” Michael asked, stepping up to Shari. 

“Yeah. Just you three,” Shari said. “And nine girls.” 

“Oh, wow.” Michael made a face. 

“Take Michael’s picture next,” Shari told Greg. 

“No way!” Michael replied quickly, raising his hands as if to shield himself 
and backing away. “The last time you took my picture with that thing, I fell 
down the stairs.” 

Trying to get away, Michael backed right into Nina Blake, one of Shari’s 
friends. She reacted with a squeal of surprise, then gave him a playful shove, and 
he kept right on backing away. 

“Michael, come on. It’s my party,” Shari called. 

“What are we going to do? Is this it?” Nina demanded from halfway across 
the yard. 

“I thought we’d take everyone’s picture and then play a game or 
something,” Shari told her. 

“A game?” Bird chimed in. “You mean like Spin the Bottle?” 

A few kids laughed. 

“Truth or Dare!” Nina suggested. 



“Yeah. Truth or Dare!” a couple of other girls called in agreement. 

“Oh, no,” Greg groaned quietly to himself. Tmth or Dare meant a lot of 
kissing and awkward, embarrassing stunts. 

Nine girls and only three boys. 

It was going to be really embarrassing. 

How could Shari do this to us? he wondered. 

“Well, did it come out?” Shari asked, grabbing his arm. “Let me see.” 

Greg was so upset about having to play Truth or Dare, he had forgotten 
about the snapshot developing in his hand. He held it up, and they both 
examined it. 

“Where am I?” Shari asked in surprise. “What were you aiming at? You 
missed me!” 

“Huh?” Greg stared at the snapshot. There was the tree. But no Shari. 
“Weird! I pointed it right at you. I lined it up carefully,” he protested. 

“Well, you missed me. I’m not in the shot,” Shari replied disgustedly. 

“But, Shari—” 

“I mean, come on —I’m not invisible, Greg. I’m not a vampire or 
something. I can see my reflection in mirrors. And I do usually show up in 
photos.” 

“But, look—” Greg stared hard at the photograph. “There’s the tree you 
were leaning against. You can see the tree trunk clearly. And there’s the spot 
where you were standing.” 

“But where am I?” Shari demanded, jangling her charm bracelet noisily. 
“Never mind.” She grabbed the snapshot from him and tossed it on the grass. 
“Take another one. Quick.” 

“Well, okay. But—” Greg was still puzzling over the photo. Why hadn’t 
Shari shown up in it? He bent down, picked it up, and shoved it into his pocket. 

“Stand closer this time,” she instructed. 

Greg moved a few steps closer, carefully centered Shari in the viewfinder, 
and snapped the picture. A square of film zipped out the front. 

Shari walked over and pulled the picture from the camera. “This one better 
turn out,” she said, staring hard at it as the colors began to darken and take form. 

“If you really want pictures of everyone, we should get another camera,” 
Greg said, his eyes also locked on the snapshot. 

“Hey—I don’t believe it!” Shari cried. 

Again, she was invisible. 



The tree photographed clearly, in perfect focus. But Shari was nowhere to 
be seen. 

“You were right. The dumb camera is broken,” she said disgustedly, 
handing the photo to Greg. “Forget it.” She turned away from him and called to 
the others. “Hey, guys—Truth or Dare!” 

There were some cheers and some groans. 

Shari headed them back to the woods behind her backyard to play. “More 
privacy,” she explained. There was a circular clearing just beyond the trees, a 
perfect, private place. 

The game was just as embarrassing as Greg had imagined. Among the boys, 
only Bird seemed to be enjoying it. Bird loves dumb stuff like this, Greg thought 
with some envy. 

Luckily, after little more than half an hour, he heard Mrs. Walker, Shari’s 
mom, calling from the house, summoning them back to cut the birthday cake. 

“Aw, too bad,” Greg said sarcastically. “Just when the game was getting 
good.” 

“We have to get out of the woods, anyway,” Bird said, grinning. “Michael’s 
shirt is scaring the squirrels.” 

Laughing and talking about the game, the kids made their way back to the 
patio, where the pink-and-white birthday cake, candles all lit, was waiting on the 
round umbrella table. 

“I must be a pretty bad mom,” Mrs. Walker joked, “allowing you all to go 
off into the woods by yourselves.” 

Some of the girls laughed. 

Cake knife in her hand, Mrs. Walker looked around. “Where’s Shari?” 

Everyone turned their eyes to search the backyard. “She was with us in the 
woods,” Nina told Mrs. Walker. “Just a minute ago.” 

“Hey, Shari!” Bird called, cupping his hands to his mouth as a megaphone. 
“Earth calling Shari! It’s cake time!” 

No reply. 

No sign of her. 

“Did she go in the house?” Greg asked. 

Mrs. Walker shook her head. “No. She didn’t come by the patio. Is she still 
in the woods?” 

“I’ll go check,” Bird told her. Calling Shari’s name, he ran to the edge of 
the trees at the back of the yard. Then he disappeared into the trees, still calling. 



A few minutes later, Bird emerged, signaling to the others with a shrug. 
No sign of her. 

They searched the house. The front yard. The woods again. 

But Shari had vanished. 



18 


Greg sat in the shade with his back against the tree trunk, the camera on the 
ground at his side, and watched the blue-uniformed policemen. 

They covered the backyard and could be seen bending low as they searched 
around in the woods. He could hear their voices but couldn’t make out what they 
were saying. Their faces were intent, bewildered. 

More policemen arrived, grim-faced, businesslike. 

And then, even more blue-uniformed policemen. 

Mrs. Walker had called her husband home from a golf game. They sat 
huddled together on canvas chairs in a corner of the patio. They whispered to 
each other, their eyes darting across the yard. Holding hands, they looked pale 
and worried. 

Everyone else had left. 

On the patio, the table was still set. The birthday candles had burned all the 
way down, the blue-and-red wax melting in hard puddles on the pink-and-white 
icing, the cake untouched. 

“No sign of her,” a red-cheeked policeman with a white-blond mustache 
was telling the Walkers. He pulled off his cap and scratched his head, revealing 
short blond hair. 

“Did someone... take her away?” Mr. Walker asked, still holding his wife’s 
hand. 

“No sign of a struggle,” the policeman said. “No sign of anything, really.” 

Mrs. Walker sighed loudly and lowered her head. “I just don’t understand 
it.” 

There was a long, painful silence. 

“We’ll keep looking,” the policeman said. “I’m sure we’ll find... 
something.” 

He turned and headed toward the woods. 

“Oh. Hi.” He stopped in front of Greg, staring down at him as if seeing him 
for the first time. “You still here, son? All the other guests have gone home.” He 
pushed his hair back and replaced his cap. 

“Yeah, I know,” Greg replied solemnly, lifting the camera into his lap. 

“I’m Officer Riddick,” he said. 



“Yeah, I know,” Greg repeated softly. 

“How come you didn’t go home after we talked with you, like the others?” 
Officer Riddick asked. 

“I’m just upset, I guess,” Greg told him. “I mean, Shari’s a good friend, you 
know?” He cleared his throat, which felt dry and tight. “Besides, I live right over 
there.” He gestured with his head to his house next door. 

“Well, you might as well go home, son,” Officer Riddick said, turning his 
eyes to the woods with a frown. “This search could take a long time. We haven’t 
found a thing back there yet.” 

“I know,” Greg replied, rubbing his hand against the back of the camera. 

And I know that this camera is the reason Shari is missing, he thought, 
feeling miserable and frightened. 

“One minute she was there. The next minute she was gone,” the policeman 
said, studying Greg’s face as if looking for answers there. 

“Yeah,” Greg replied. “It’s so weird.” 

It’s weirder than anyone knows, Greg thought. 

The camera made her invisible. The camera did it. 

First, she vanished from the snapshot. 

Then she vanished in real life. 

The camera did it to her. I don’t know how. But it did. 

“Do you have something more to tell me?” Officer Riddick asked, hands 
resting on his hips, his right hand just above the worn brown holster that carried 
his pistol. “Did you see something? Something that might give us a clue, help us 
out? Something you didn’t remember to tell me before?” 

Should I tell him? Greg wondered. 

If I tell him about the camera, he’ll ask where I got it. And I’ll have to tell 
him that I got it in the Coffman house. And we’ll all get in trouble for breaking in 
there. 

But—big deal. Shari is missing. Gone. Vanished. That’s a lot more 
important. 

I should tell him, Greg decided. 

But then he hesitated. If I tell him, he won’t believe me. 

If I tell him, how will it help bring Shari back? 

“You look very troubled,” Officer Riddick said, squatting down next to 
Greg in the shade. “What’s your name again?” 

“Greg. Greg Banks.” 



“Well, you look very troubled, Greg,” the policeman repeated softly. “Why 
don’t you tell me what’s bothering you? Why don’t you tell me what’s on your 
mind? I think it’ll make you feel a lot better.” 

Greg took a deep breath and glanced up to the patio. Mrs. Walker had 
covered her face with her hands. Her husband was leaning over her, trying to 
comfort her. 

“Well...” Greg started. 

“Go ahead, son,” Officer Riddick urged softly. “Do you know where Shari 

is?” 

“It’s this camera,” Greg blurted out. He suddenly could feel the blood 
throbbing against his temples. 

He took a deep breath and then continued. “You see, this camera is weird.” 

“What do you mean?” Officer Riddick asked quietly. 

Greg took another deep breath. “I took Shari’s picture. Before. When I first 
arrived. I took two pictures. And she was invisible. In both of them. See?” 

Officer Riddick closed his eyes, then opened them. “No. I don’t 
understand.” 

“Shari was invisible in the picture. Everything else was there. But she 
wasn’t. She had vanished, see? And then later, she vanished for real. The camera 
—it predicts the future, I guess. Or it makes bad things happen.” Greg raised the 
camera, attempting to hand it to the policeman. 

Officer Riddick made no attempt to take it. He just stared hard at Greg, his 
eyes narrowing, his expression hardening. 

Greg felt a sudden stab of fear. 

Oh, no, he thought. Why is he looking at me like that? What is he going to 

do? 



19 


Greg continued to hold the camera out to the policeman. 

But Officer Riddick quickly climbed to his feet. “The camera makes bad 
things happen?” His eyes burned into Greg’s. 

“Yes,” Greg told him. “It isn’t my camera, see? And every time I take a 
picture—” 

“Son, that’s enough,” Officer Riddick said gently. He reached down and 
rested a hand on Greg’s trembling shoulder. “I think you’re very upset, Greg,” he 
said, his voice almost a whisper. “I don’t blame you. This is very upsetting for 
everyone.” 

“But it’s true —” Greg started to insist. 

“I’m going to ask that policeman over there,” Officer Riddick said, 
pointing, “to take you home now. And I’m going to have him tell your parents 
that you’ve been through a very frightening experience.” 

/knew he wouldn’t believe me, Greg thought angrily. 

How could I have been so stupid? 

Now he thinks I’m some kind of a nutcase. 

Officer Riddick called to a policeman at the side of the house near the 
hedge. 

“No, that’s okay,” Greg said, quickly pulling himself up, cradling the 
camera in his hand. “I can make it home okay.” 

Officer Riddick eyed him suspiciously. “You sure?” 

“Yeah. I can walk by myself.” 

“If you have anything to tell me later,” Officer Riddick said, lowering his 
gaze to the camera, “just call the station, okay?” 

“Okay,” Greg replied, walking slowly toward the front of the house. 

“Don’t worry, Greg. We’ll do our best,” Officer Riddick called after him. 
“We’ll find her. Put the camera away and try to get some rest, okay?” 

“Okay,” Greg muttered. 

He hurried past the Walkers, who were still huddled together under the 
umbrella on the patio. 

Why was I so stupid? he asked himself as he walked home. Why did I 
expect that policeman to believe such a weird story? 



I’m not even sure I believe it myself. 

A few minutes later, he pulled open the back screen door and entered his 
kitchen. “Anybody home?” 

No reply. 

He headed through the back hall toward the living room. “Anyone home?” 

No one. 

Terry was at work. His mother must have been visiting his dad at the 
hospital. 

Greg felt bad. He really didn’t feel like being alone now. He really wanted 
to tell them about what had happened to Shari. He really wanted to talk to them. 

Still cradling the camera, he climbed the stairs to his room. 

He stopped in the doorway, blinked twice, then uttered a cry of horror. 

His books were scattered all over the floor. The covers had been pulled off 
his bed. His desk drawers were all open, their contents strewn around the room. 
The desk lamp was on its side on the floor. All of his clothes had been pulled 
from the dresser and his closet and tossed everywhere. 

Someone had been in Greg’s room—and had turned it upside down! 



20 


Who would do this? Greg asked himself, staring in horror at his ransacked room. 

Who would tear my room apart like this? 

He realized that he knew the answer. He knew who would do it, who had 
done it. 

Someone looking for the camera. 

Someone desperate to get the camera back. 

Spidey? 

The creepy guy who dressed all in black was living in the Coffman house. 
Was he the owner of the camera? 

Yes, Greg knew, Spidey had done it. 

Spidey had been watching Greg, spying on Greg from behind the bleachers 
at the Little League game. 

He knew that Greg had his camera. And he knew where Greg lived. 

That thought was the most chilling of all. 

He knew where Greg lived. 

Greg turned away from the chaos in his room, leaned against the wall of the 
hallway, and closed his eyes. 

He pictured Spidey, the dark figure creeping along so evilly on his spindly 
legs. He pictured him inside the house, Greg’s house. Inside Greg’s room. 

He was here, thought Greg. He pawed through all my things. He wrecked 
my room. 

Greg stepped back into his room. He felt all mixed up. He felt like shouting 
angrily and crying for help all at once. 

But he was all alone. No one to hear him. No one to help him. 

What now? he wondered. What now? 

Suddenly, leaning against the doorframe, staring at his ransacked room, he 
knew what he had to do. 



21 


“Hey, Bird, it’s me.” 

Greg held the receiver in one hand and wiped the sweat off his forehead 
with the other. He’d never worked so hard—or so fast—in all his life. 

“Did they find Shari?” Bird asked eagerly. 

“I haven’t heard. I don’t think so,” Greg said, his eyes surveying his room. 
Almost back to normal. 

He had put everything back, cleaned and straightened. His parents would 
never guess. 

“Listen, Bird, I’m not calling about that,” Greg said, speaking rapidly into 
the phone. “Call Michael for me, okay? Meet me at the playground. By the 
baseball diamond.” 

“When? Now?” Bird asked, sounding confused. 

“Yeah,” Greg told him. “We have to meet. It’s important.” 

“It’s almost dinnertime,” Bird protested. “I don’t know if my parents—” 

“It’s important,” Greg repeated impatiently. “I’ve got to see you guys. 
Okay?” 

“Well... maybe I can sneak out for a few minutes,” Bird said, lowering his 
voice. And then Greg heard him shout to his mother: “It’s no one, Ma! I’m 
talking to no one!” 

Boy, that’s quick thinking! Greg thought sarcastically. He’s a worse liar than 
I am! 

And then he heard Bird call to his mom: “I know I’m on the phone. But I’m 
not talking to anyone. It’s only Greg.” 

Thanks a lot, pal, Greg thought. 

“I gotta go,” Bird said. 

“Get Michael, okay?” Greg urged. 

“Yeah. Okay. See you.” He hung up. 

Greg replaced the receiver, then listened for his mother. Silence downstairs. 
She still wasn’t home. She didn’t know about Shari, Greg realized. He knew she 
and his dad were going to be very upset. 

Very upset. 

Almost as upset as he was. 



Thinking about his missing friend, he went to his bedroom window and 
looked down on her yard next door. It was deserted now. 

The policemen had all left. Shari’s shaken parents must have gone inside. 

A squirrel sat under the wide shade of the big tree, gnawing furiously at an 
acorn, another acorn at his feet. 

In the corner of the window, Greg could see the birthday cake, still sitting 
forlornly on the deserted table, the places all set, the decorations still standing. 

A birthday party for ghosts. 

Greg shuddered. 

“Shari is alive,” he said aloud. “They’ll find her. She’s alive.” 

He knew what he had to do now. 

Forcing himself away from the window, he hurried to meet his two friends. 



22 


“No way,” Bird said heatedly, leaning against the bleacher bench. “Have you 
gone totally bananas?” 

Swinging the camera by its cord, Greg turned hopefully to Michael. But 
Michael avoided Greg’s stare. “I’m with Bird,” he said, his eyes on the camera. 

Since it was just about dinnertime, the playground was nearly deserted. A 
few little kids were on the swings at the other end. Two kids were riding their 
bikes around and around the soccer field. 

“I thought maybe you guys would come with me,” Greg said, disappointed. 
He kicked up a clump of grass with his sneaker. “I have to return this thing,” he 
continued, raising the camera. “I know it’s what I have to do. I have to put it 
back where I found it.” 

“No way,” Bird repeated, shaking his head. “I’m not going back to the 
Coffman house. Once was enough.” 

“Chicken?” Greg asked angrily. 

“Yeah,” Bird quickly admitted. 

“You don’t have to take it back,” Michael argued. He pulled himself up the 
side of the bleachers, climbed onto the third deck of seats, then lowered himself 
to the ground. 

“What do you mean?” Greg asked impatiently, kicking at the grass. 

“Just toss it, Greg,” Michael urged, making a throwing motion with one 
hand. “Heave it. Throw it in the trash somewhere.” 

“Yeah. Or leave it right here,” Bird suggested. He reached for the camera. 
“Give it to me. I’ll hide it under the seats.” 

“You don’t understand,” Greg said, swinging the camera out of Bird’s 
reach. “Throwing it away won’t do any good.” 

“Why not?” Bird asked, making another swipe for the camera. 

“Spidey’ll just come back for it,” Greg told him heatedly. “He’ll come back 
to my room looking for it. He’ll come after me. I know it.” 

“But what if we get caught taking it back?” Michael asked. 

“Yeah. What if Spidey’s there in the Coffman house, and he catches us?” 
Bird said. 

“You don’t understand,” Greg cried. “He knows where I live! He was in my 



house. He was in my room! He wants his camera back, and— 

“Here. Give it to me,” Bird said. “We don’t have to go back to that house. 
He can find it. Right here.” 

He grabbed again for the camera. 

Greg held tightly to the strap and tried to tug it away. 

But Bird grabbed the side of the camera. 

“No!” Greg cried out as it flashed. And whirred. 

A square of film slid out. 

“No!” Greg cried to Bird, horrified, staring at the white square as it started 
to develop. “You took my picture!” 

His hand trembling, he pulled the snapshot from the camera. 

What would it show? 



23 


“Sorry,” Bird said. “I didn’t mean to—” 

Before he could finish his sentence, a voice interrupted from behind the 
bleachers. “Hey—what’ve you got there?” 

Greg looked up from the developing snapshot in surprise. Two tough¬ 
looking boys stepped out of the shadows, their expressions hard, their eyes on 
the camera. 

He recognized them immediately—Joey Ferris and Mickey Ward—two 
ninth-graders who hung out together, always swaggering around, acting tough, 
picking on kids younger than them. 

Their specialty was taking kids’ bikes, riding off on them, and dumping 
them somewhere. There was a rumor around school that Mickey had once beaten 
up a kid so badly that the kid was crippled for life. But Greg believed Mickey 
made up that rumor and spread it himself. 

Both boys were big for their age. Neither of them did very well in school. 
And even though they were always stealing bikes and skateboards, and 
terrorizing little kids, and getting into fights, neither of them ever seemed to get 
into serious trouble. 

Joey had short blond hair, slicked straight up, and wore a diamondlike stud 
in one ear. Mickey had a round, red face full of pimples, stringy black hair down 
to his shoulders, and was working a toothpick between his teeth. Both boys were 
wearing heavy-metal T-shirts and jeans. 

“Hey, I’ve gotta get home,” Bird said quickly, half stepping, half dancing 
away from the bleachers. 

“Me, too,” Michael said, unable to keep the fear from showing on his face. 

Greg tucked the snapshot into his jeans pocket. 

“Hey, you found my camera,” Joey said, grabbing it out of Greg’s hand. His 
small gray eyes burned into Greg’s as if searching for a reaction. “Thanks, man.” 

“Give it back, Joey,” Greg said with a sigh. 

“Yeah. Don’t take that camera,” Mickey told his friend, a smile spreading 
over his round face. “It’s mine!” He wrestled the camera away from Joey. 

“Give it back,” Greg insisted angrily, reaching out his hand. Then he 
softened his tone. “Come on, guys. It isn’t mine.” 



“I know it isn’t yours,” Mickey said, grinning. “Because it’s minel” 

“I have to give it back to the owner,” Greg told him, trying not to whine but 
hearing his voice edge up. 

“No, you don’t. I’m the owner now,” Mickey insisted. 

“Haven’t you ever heard of finders keepers?” Joey asked, leaning over Greg 
menacingly. He was about six inches taller than Greg and a lot more muscular. 

“Hey, let him have the thing,” Michael whispered in Greg’s ear. “You 
wanted to get rid of it—right?” 

“No!” Greg protested. 

“What’s your problem, Freckle Face?” Joey asked Michael, eyeing him up 
and down. 

“No problem,” Michael said meekly. 

“Hey—say cheese!” Mickey aimed the camera at Joey. 

“Don’t do it,” Bird interrupted, waving his hands frantically. 

“Why not?” Joey demanded. 

“Because your face will break the camera,” Bird said, laughing. 

“You’re real funny,” Joey said sarcastically, narrowing his eyes 
threateningly, hardening his features. “You want that stupid smile to be 
permanent?” He raised a big fist. 

“I know this kid,” Mickey told Joey, pointing at Bird. “Thinks he’s hot 
stuff.” 

Both boys stared hard at Bird, trying to scare him. 

Bird swallowed hard. He took a step back, bumping into the bleachers. “No, 
I don’t,” he said softly. “I don’t think I’m hot stuff.” 

“He looks like something I stepped in yesterday,” Joey said. 

He and Mickey cracked up, laughing high-pitched hyena laughs and 
slapping each other high fives. 

“Listen, guys. I really need the camera back,” Greg said, reaching out a 
hand to take it. “It isn’t any good, anyway. It’s broken. And it doesn’t belong to 
me.” 

“Yeah, that’s right. It’s broken,” Michael added, nodding his head. 

“Yeah. Right,” Mickey said sarcastically. “Let’s just see.” He raised the 
camera again and pointed it at Joey. 

“Really, guys. I need it back,” Greg said desperately. 

If they took a picture with the camera, Greg realized, they might discover 
its secret. That its snapshots showed the future, showed only bad things 



happening to people. That the camera was evil. Maybe it even caused evil. 

“Say cheese,” Mickey instructed Joey. 

“Just snap the stupid thing!” Joey replied impatiently. 

No, Greg thought. I can’t let this happen. I’ve got to return the camera to 
the Coffman house, to Spidey. 

Impulsively, Greg leaped forward. With a cry, he snatched the camera away 
from Mickey’s face. 

“Hey—” Mickey reacted in surprise. 

“Let’s go !” Greg shouted to Bird and Michael. 

And without another word, the three friends turned and began running 
across the deserted playground toward their homes. 

His heart thudding in his chest, Greg gripped the camera tightly and ran as 
fast as he could, his sneakers pounding over the dry grass. 

They’re going to catch us, Greg thought, panting loudly now as he raced 
toward the street. They’re going to catch us and pound us. They’re going to take 
back the camera. We’re dead meat. Dead meat. 

Greg and his friends didn’t turn around until they were across the street. 
Breathing noisily, they looked back—and cried out in relieved surprise. 

Joey and Mickey hadn’t budged from beside the bleachers. They hadn’t 
chased after them. They were leaning against the bleachers, laughing. 

“Catch you later, guys!” Joey called after them. 

“Yeah. Later,” Mickey repeated. 

They both burst out laughing again, as if they had said something hilarious. 
“That was close,” Michael said, still breathing hard. 

“They mean it,” Bird said, looking very troubled. “They’ll catch us later. 
We’re history.” 

“Tough talk. They’re just a lot of hot air,” Greg insisted. 

“Oh, yeah?” Michael cried. “Then why did we run like that?” 

“Because we’re late for dinner,” Bird joked. “See you guys. I’m gonna 
catch it if I don’t hurry.” 

“But the camera—” Greg protested, still gripping it tightly in one hand. 

“It’s too late,” Michael said, nervously raking a hand back through his red 

hair. 

“Yeah. We’ll have to do it tomorrow or something,” Bird agreed. 

“Then you guys will come with me?” Greg asked eagerly. 

“Uh... I’ve gotta go,” Bird said without answering. 



“Me, too,” Michael said quickly, avoiding Greg’s stare. 

All three of them turned their eyes back to the playground. Joey and 
Mickey had disappeared. Probably off to terrorize some other kids. 

“Later,” Bird said, slapping Greg on the shoulder as he headed away. The 
three friends split up, running in different directions across lawns and driveways, 
heading home. 

Greg had run all the way to his front yard before he remembered the 
snapshot he had shoved into his jeans pocket. 

He stopped in the driveway and pulled it out. 

The sun was lowering behind the garage. He held the snapshot up close to 
his face to see it clearly. 

“Oh, no!” he cried. “I don’t believe it!” 



24 


“This is impossible !” Greg cried aloud, gaping at the snapshot in his trembling 
hand. 

How had Shari gotten into the photo? 

It had been taken a few minutes before, in front of the bleachers on the 
playground. 

But there was Shari, standing close beside Greg. 

His hand trembling, his mouth hanging open in disbelief, Greg goggled at 
the photo. 

It was very clear, very sharp. There they were on the playground. He could 
see the baseball diamond in the background. 

And there they were. Greg and Shari. 

Shari standing so clear, so sharp—right next to him. 

And they were both staring straight ahead, their eyes wide, their mouths 
open, their expressions frozen in horror as a large shadow covered them both. 

“Shari?” Greg cried, lowering the snapshot and darting his eyes over the 
front yard. “Are you here? Can you hear me?” 

He listened. 

Silence. 

He tried again. 

“Shari? Are you here?” 

“Greg!” a voice called. 

Uttering a startled cry, Greg spun around. “Huh?” 

“Greg!” the voice repeated. It took him a while to realize that it was his 
mother, calling to him from the front door. 

“Oh. Hi, Mom.” Feeling dazed, he slid the snapshot back into his jeans 
pocket. 

“Where 5 ve you been?” his mother asked as he made his way to the door. “I 
heard about Shari. I’ve been so upset. I didn’t know where you were.” 

“Sorry, Mom,” Greg said, kissing her on the cheek. “I—I should’ve left a 
note.” 

He stepped into the house, feeling strange and out of sorts, sad and 



confused and frightened, all at the same time. 


Two days later, on a day of high gray clouds, the air hot and smoggy, Greg paced 
back and forth in his room after school. 

The house was empty except for him. Terry had gone off a few hours before 
to his after-school job at the Dairy Freeze. Mrs. Banks had driven to the hospital 
to pick up Greg’s dad, who was finally coming home. 

Greg knew he should be happy about his dad’s return. But there were still 
too many things troubling him, tugging at his mind. 

Frightening him. 

For one thing, Shari still hadn’t been found. 

The police were completely baffled. Their new theory was that she’d been 
kidnapped. 

Her frantic, grieving parents waited home by the phone. But no kidnappers 
called to demand a ransom. 

There were no clues of any kind. 

Nothing to do but wait. And hope. 

As time passed, Greg felt more and more guilty. He was sure Shari hadn’t 
been kidnapped. He knew that somehow, the camera had made her disappear. 

But he couldn’t tell anyone else what he believed. 

No one would believe him. Anyone he tried to tell the story to would think 
he was crazy. 

Cameras can’t be evil, after all. 

Cameras can’t make people fall down stairs. Or crash their cars. 

Or vanish from sight. 

Cameras can only record what they see. 

Greg stared out of his window, pressing his forehead against the glass, 
looking down on Shari’s backyard. “Shari—where are you?” he asked aloud, 
staring at the tree where she had posed. 

The camera was still hidden in the secret compartment in his headboard. 
Neither Bird nor Michael would agree to help Greg return it to the Coffman 
house. 

Besides, Greg had decided to hold on to it a while longer, in case he needed 
it as proof. 

In case he decided to confide his fears about it to someone. 

In case... 



His other fear was that Spidey would come back, back to Greg’s room, back 
for the camera. 

So much to be frightened about. 

He pushed himself away from the window. He had spent so much time in 
the past couple of days staring down at Shari’s empty backyard. 

Thinking. Thinking. 

With a sigh, he reached into the headboard and pulled out two of the 
snapshots he had hidden in there along with the camera. 

The two snapshots were the ones taken the past Saturday at Shari’s birthday 
party. Holding one in each hand, Greg stared at them, hoping he could see 
something new, something he hadn’t noticed before. 

But the photos hadn’t changed. They still showed her tree, her backyard, 
green in the sunlight. And no Shari. No one where Shari had been standing. As if 
the lens had penetrated right through her. 

Staring at the photos, Greg let out a cry of anguish. 

If only he had never gone into the Coffman house. 

If only he had never stolen the camera. 

If only he had never taken any photos with it. 

If only... if only... if only... 

Before he realized what he was doing, he was ripping the two snapshots 
into tiny pieces. 

Panting loudly, his chest heaving, he tore up the snapshots and let the pieces 
fall to the floor. 

When he had ripped them both into tiny shards of paper, he flung himself 
facedown on his bed and closed his eyes, waiting for his heart to stop pounding, 
waiting for the heavy feeling of guilt and horror to lift. 

Two hours later, the phone by his bed rang. 

It was Shari. 



25 


“Shari—is it really you?” Greg shouted into the phone. 

“Yeah. It’s me!” She sounded as surprised as he did. 

“But how? I mean—” His mind was racing. He didn’t know what to say. 

“Your guess is as good as mine,” Shari told him. And then she said, “Hold 
on a minute.” And he heard her step away from the phone to talk to her mother. 
“Mom—stop crying already. Mom—it’s really me. I’m home.” 

A few seconds later, she came back on the line. “I’ve been home for two 
hours, and Mom’s still crying and carrying on.” 

“I feel like crying, too,” Greg admitted. “I—I just can’t believe it! Shari, 
where were you?” 

The line was silent for a long moment. “I don’t know,” she answered 
finally. 

“Huh?” 

“I really don’t. It was just so weird, Greg. One minute, there I was at my 
birthday party. The next minute, I was standing in front of my house. And it was 
two days later. But I don’t remember being away. Or being anywhere else. I 
don’t remember anything at all.” 

“You don’t remember going away? Or coming back?” Greg asked. 

“No. Nothing,” Shari said, her voice trembling. 

“Shari, those pictures I took of you—remember? With the weird camera? 
You were invisible in them—” 

“And then I disappeared,” she said, finishing his thought. 

“Shari, do you think—?” 

“I don’t know,” she replied quickly. “I—I have to get off now. The police 
are here. They want to question me. What am I going to tell them? They’re 
going to think I had amnesia or flipped out or something.” 

“I—I don’t know,” Greg said, completely bewildered. “We have to talk. 
The camera—” 

“I can’t now,” she told him. “Maybe tomorrow. Okay?” She called to her 
mother that she was coming. “Bye, Greg. See you.” And then she hung up. 

Greg replaced the receiver but sat on the edge of his bed staring at the 
phone for a long time. 



Shari was back. 

She’d been back about two hours. 

Two hours. Two hours. Two hours. 

He turned his eyes to the clock radio beside the phone. 

Just two hours before, he had ripped up the two snapshots of an invisible 
Shari. 

His mind whirred with wild ideas, insane ideas. 

Had he brought Shari back by ripping up the photos? 

Did this mean that the camera caused her to disappear? That the camera 
caused all of the terrible things that showed up in its snapshots? 

Greg stared at the phone for a long time, thinking hard. 

He knew what he had to do. He had to talk to Shari. And he had to return 
the camera. 

He met Shari on the playground the next afternoon. The sun floated high in a 
cloudless sky. Eight or nine kids were engaged in a noisy brawl of a soccer 
game, running one way, then the other across the outfield of the baseball 
diamond. 

“Hey—you look like youl” Greg exclaimed as Shari came jogging up to 
where he stood beside the bleachers. He pinched her arm. “Yeah. It’s you, okay.” 

She didn’t smile. “I feel fine,” she told him, rubbing her arm. “Just 
confused. And tired. The police asked me questions for hours. And when they 
finally went away, my parents started in.” 

“Sorry,” Greg said quietly, staring down at his sneakers. 

“I think Mom and Dad believe somehow it’s my fault that I disappeared,” 
Shari said, resting her back against the side of the bleachers, shaking her head. 

“It’s the camera’s fault,” Greg muttered. He raised his eyes to hers. “The 
camera is evil.” 

Shari shrugged. “Maybe. I don’t know what to think. I really don’t.” 

He showed her the snapshot, the one showing the two of them on the 
playground staring in horror as a shadow crept over them. 

“How weird,” Shari exclaimed, studying it hard. 

“I want to take the camera back to the Coffman house,” Greg said heatedly. 
“I can go home and get it now. Will you help me? Will you come with me?” 

Shari started to reply but stopped. 

They both saw the dark shadow move, sliding toward them quickly, silently, 



over the grass. 

And then they saw the man dressed all in black, his spindly legs pumping 
hard as he came at them. 

Spidey! 

Greg grabbed Shari’s hand, frozen in fear. 

He and Shari gaped in terror as Spidey’s slithering shadow crept over them. 



26 


Greg had a shudder of recognition. He knew the snapshot had just come true. 

As the dark figure of Spidey moved toward them like a black tarantula, 
Greg pulled Shari’s hand. “Run!” he cried in a shrill voice he didn’t recognize. 

He didn’t have to say it. They were both running now, gasping as they ran 
across the grass toward the street. Their sneakers thudded loudly on the ground 
as they reached the sidewalk and kept running. 

Greg turned to see Spidey closing the gap. “He’s catching up!” he managed 
to cry to Shari, who was a few steps ahead of him. 

Spidey, his face still hidden in the shadows of his black baseball cap, 
moved with startling speed, his long legs kicking high as he pursued them. 

“He’s going to catch us!” Greg cried, feeling as if his chest were about to 
burst. “He’s... too... fast!” 

Spidey moved even closer, his shadow scuttling over the grass. 

Closer. 

When the car horn honked, Greg screamed. 

He and Shari stopped short. 

The horn blasted out again. 

Greg turned to see a familiar young man inside a small hatchback. It was 
Jerry Norman, who lived across the street. Jerry lowered his car window. “Is this 
man chasing you?” he asked excitedly. Without waiting for an answer, he backed 
the car toward Spidey. “I’m calling the cops, mister!” 

Spidey didn’t reply. Instead, he turned and darted across the street. 

“I’m warning you—” Jerry called after him. 

But Spidey had disappeared behind a tall hedge. 

“Are you kids okay?” Greg’s neighbor demanded. 

“Yeah. Fine,” Greg managed to reply, still breathing hard, his chest heaving. 

“We’re okay. Thanks, Jerry,” Shari said. 

“I’ve seen that guy around the neighborhood,” the young man said, staring 
through the windshield at the tall hedge. “Never thought he was dangerous. You 
kids want me to call the police?” 

“No. It’s okay,” Greg replied. 



As soon as I give him back his camera, he’ll stop chasing us, Greg thought. 

“Well, be careful—okay?” Jerry said. “You need a lift home or anything?” 
He studied their faces as if trying to determine how frightened and upset they 
were. 

Greg and Shari both shook their heads. “We’ll be okay,” Greg said. 
“Thanks.” 

Jerry warned them once again to be careful, then drove off, his tires 
squealing as he turned the corner. 

“That was close,” Shari said, her eyes on the hedge. “Why was Spidey 
chasing us?” 

“He thought I had the camera. He wants it back,” Greg told her. “Meet me 
tomorrow, okay? In front of the Coffman house. Help me put it back?” 

Shari stared at him without replying, her expression thoughtful, wary. 

“We’re going to be in danger—all of us—until we put that camera back,” 
Greg insisted. 

“Okay,” Shari said quietly. “Tomorrow.” 



27 


Something scurried through the tall weeds of the unmowed front lawn. “What 
was that?” Shari cried, whispering even though no one else was in sight. “It was 
too big to be a squirrel.” 

She lingered behind Greg, who stopped to look up at the Coffman house. 
“Maybe it was a raccoon or something,” Greg told her. He gripped the camera 
tightly in both hands. 

It was a little after three o’clock the next afternoon, a hazy, overcast day. 
Mountains of dark clouds threatening rain were rolling across the sky, stretching 
behind the house, casting it in shadow. 

“It’s going to storm,” Shari said, staying close behind Greg. “Let’s get this 
over with and go home.” 

“Good idea,” he said, glancing up at the heavy sky. 

Thunder rumbled in the distance, a low roar. 

The old trees that dotted the front yard whispered and shook. 

“We can’t just run inside,” Greg told her, watching the sky darken. “First 
we have to make sure Spidey isn’t there.” 

Making their way quickly through the tall grass and weeds, they stopped at 
the living room window and peered in. Thunder rumbled, low and long, in the 
distance. Greg thought he saw another creature scuttle through the weeds around 
the corner of the house. 

“It’s too dark in there. I can’t see a thing,” Shari complained. 

“Let’s check out the basement,” Greg suggested. “That’s where Spidey 
hangs out, remember?” 

The sky darkened to an eerie gray-green as they made their way to the back 
of the house and dropped to their knees to peer down through the basement 
windows at ground level. 

Squinting through the dust-covered window-panes, they could see the 
makeshift plywood table, the wardrobe against the wall, its doors still open, the 
colorful old clothing spilling out, the empty frozen food boxes scattered on the 
floor. 

“No sign of him,” Greg whispered, cradling the camera in his arm as if it 
might try to escape from him if he didn’t hold it tightly. “Let’s get moving.” 



“Are—are you sure?” Shari stammered. She wanted to be brave. But the 
thought that she had disappeared for two days—completely vanished, most 
likely because of the camera—that frightening thought lingered in her mind. 

Michael and Bird were chicken, she thought. But maybe they were the smart 

ones. 

She wished this were over. All over. 

A few seconds later, Greg and Shari pushed open the front door. They 
stepped into the darkness of the front hall. And stopped. 

And listened. 

And then they both jumped at the sound of the loud, sudden crash directly 
behind them. 



28 


Shari was the first to regain her voice. “It’s just the door!” she cried. “The wind 

55 

A gust of wind had made the front door slam. 

“Let’s get this over with,” Greg whispered, badly shaken. 

“We never should’ve broken into this house in the first place,” Shari 
whispered as they made their way on tiptoe, step by creaking step, down the dark 
hallway toward the basement stairs. 

“It’s a little late for that,” Greg replied sharply. 

Pulling open the door to the basement steps, he stopped again. “What’s that 
banging sound upstairs?” 

Shari’s features tightened in fear as she heard it, too, a repeated, almost 
rhythmic banging. 

“Shutters?” Greg suggested. 

“Yeah,” she quickly agreed, breathing a sigh of relief. “A lot of the shutters 
are loose, remember?” 

The entire house seemed to groan. 

Thunder rumbled outside, closer now. 

They stepped onto the landing, then waited for their eyes to adjust to the 
darkness. 

“Couldn’t we just leave the camera up here and run?” Shari asked, more of 
a plea than a question. 

“No. I want to put it back,” Greg insisted. 

“But, Greg—” She tugged at his arm as he started down the stairs. 

“No!” He pulled out of her grasp. “He was in my room, Shari! He tore 
everything apart, looking for it. I want him to find it where it belongs. If he 
doesn’t find it, he’ll come back to my house. I know he will!” 

“Okay, okay. Let’s just hurry.” 

It was brighter in the basement, gray light seeping down from the four 
ground-level windows. Outside, the wind swirled and pushed against the 
windowpanes. A pale flash of lightning made shadows flicker against the 
basement wall. The old house groaned as if unhappy about the storm. 

“What was that ? Footsteps?” Shari stopped halfway across the basement 



and listened. 

“It’s just the house,” Greg insisted. But his quavering voice revealed that he 
was as frightened as his companion, and he stopped to listen, too. 

Bang. Bang. Bang. 

The shutter high above them continued its rhythmic pounding. 

“Where did you find the camera, anyway?” Shari whispered, following 
Greg to the far wall across from the enormous furnace with its cobwebbed ducts 
sprouting up like pale tree limbs. 

“Over here,” Greg told her. He stepped up to the worktable and reached for 
the vise clamped on the edge. “When I turned the vise, a door opened up. Some 
kind of hidden shelf. That’s where the camera—” 

He cranked the handle of the vise. 

Once again, the door to the secret shelf popped open. 

“Good,” he whispered excitedly. He flashed Shari a smile. 

He shoved the camera onto the shelf, tucking the carrying strap under it. 
Then he pushed the door closed. “We’re out of here.” 

He felt so much better. So relieved. So much lighter. 

The house groaned and creaked. Greg didn’t care. 

Another flash of lightning, brighter this time, like a camera flash, sent 
shadows flickering on the wall. 

“Come on,” he whispered. But Shari was already ahead of him, making her 
way carefully over the food cartons strewn everywhere, hurrying toward the 
steps. 

They were halfway up the stairs, Greg one step behind Shari, when, above 
them, Spidey stepped silently into view on the landing, blocking their escape. 



29 


Greg blinked and shook his head, as if he could shake away the image of the 
figure that stared darkly down at him. 

“No!” Shari cried out, and fell back against Greg. 

He grabbed for the railing, forgetting that it had fallen under Michael’s 
weight during their first unfortunate visit to the house. Luckily, Shari regained 
her balance before toppling them both down the stairs. 

Lightning flashed behind them, sending a flash of white light across the 
stairway. But the unmoving figure on the landing above them remained shrouded 
in darkness. 

“Let us go!” Greg finally managed to cry, finding his voice. 

“Yeah. We returned your camera!” Shari added, sounding shrill and 
frightened. 

Spidey didn’t reply. Instead, he took a step toward them, onto the first step. 
And then he descended another step. 

Nearly stumbling again, Greg and Shari backed down to the basement floor. 

The wooden stairs squeaked in protest as the dark figure stepped slowly, 
steadily, down. As he reached the basement floor, a crackling bolt of lightning 
cast a blue light over him, and Greg and Shari saw his face for the first time. 

In the brief flash of color, they saw that he was old, older than they had 
imagined. That his eyes were small and round like dark marbles. That his mouth 
was small, too, pursed in a tight, menacing grimace. 

“We returned the camera,” Shari said, staring in fear as Spidey crept closer. 
“Can’t we go now? Please?” 

“Let me see,” Spidey said. His voice was younger than his face, warmer 
than his eyes. “Come.” 

They hesitated. But he gave them no choice. 

Ushering them back across the cluttered floor to the worktable, he wrapped 
his large, spidery hand over the vise and turned the handle. The door opened. He 
pulled out the camera and held it close to his face to examine it. 

“You shouldn’t have taken it,” he told them, speaking softly, turning the 
camera in his hands. 

“We’re sorry,” Shari said quickly. 



“Can we go now?” Greg asked, edging toward the stairs. 

“It’s not an ordinary camera,” Spidey said, raising his small eyes to them. 

“We know,” Greg blurted out. “The pictures it took. They—” 

Spidey’s eyes grew wide, his expression angry. “You took pictures with it?” 

“Just a few,” Greg told him, wishing he had kept his mouth shut. “They 
didn’t come out. Really.” 

“You know about the camera, then,” Spidey said, moving quickly to the 
center of the floor. 

Was he trying to block their escape? Greg wondered. 

“It’s broken or something,” Greg said uncertainly, shoving his hands into 
his jeans pockets. 

“It’s not broken,” the tall, dark figure said softly. “It’s evil.” He motioned 
toward the low plywood table. “Sit there.” 

Shari and Greg exchanged glances. Then, reluctantly, they sat down on the 
edge of the board, sitting stiffly, nervously, their eyes darting toward the 
stairway, toward escape. 

“The camera is evil,” Spidey repeated, standing over them, holding the 
camera in both hands. “I should know. I helped to create it.” 

“You’re an inventor?” Greg asked, glancing at Shari, who was nervously 
tugging at a strand of her black hair. 

“I’m a scientist,” Spidey replied. “Or, I should say, I was a scientist. My 
name is Fredericks. Dr. Fritz Fredericks.” He transferred the camera from one 
hand to the other. “My lab partner invented this camera. It was his pride and joy. 
More than that, it would have made him a fortune. Would have, I say.” He 
paused, a thoughtful expression sinking over his face. 

“What happened to him? Did he die?” Shari asked, still fiddling with the 
strand of hair. 

Dr. Fredericks snickered. “No. Worse. I stole the invention from him. I stole 
the plans and the camera. I was evil, you see. I was young and greedy. So very 
greedy. And I wasn’t above stealing to make my fortune.” 

He paused, eyeing them both as if waiting for them to say something, to 
offer their disapproval of him, perhaps. But when Greg and Shari remained 
silent, staring up at him from the low plywood table, he continued his story. 

“When I stole the camera, it caught my partner by surprise. Unfortunately, 
from then on, all of the surprises were mine.” A strange, sad smile twisted across 
his aged face. “My partner, you see, was much more evil than I was.” 



Dr. Fredericks coughed into his hand, then began to pace in front of Greg 
and Shari as he talked, speaking softly, slowly, as if remembering the story for 
the first time in a long while. 

“My partner was a true evil one. He dabbled in the dark arts. I should 
correct myself. He didn’t just dabble. He was quite a master of it all.” 

He held up the camera, waving it above his head, then lowering it. “My 
partner put a curse on the camera. If he couldn’t profit from it, he wanted to 
make sure that I never would, either. And so he put a curse on it.” 

He turned his gaze on Greg, leaning over him. “Do you know about how 
some primitive peoples fear the camera? They fear the camera because they 
believe that if it takes their picture, it will steal their soul.” He patted the camera. 
“Well, this camera really does steal souls.” 

Staring up at the camera, Greg shuddered. 

The camera had stolen Shari away. 

Would it have stolen all of their souls? 

“People have died because of this camera,” Dr. Fredericks said, uttering a 
slow, sad sigh. “People close to me. That is how I came to learn of the curse, to 
learn of the camera’s evil. And then I learned something just as frightening—the 
camera cannot be destroyed.” 

He coughed, cleared his throat noisily, and began to pace in front of them 
again. “And so I vowed to keep the camera a secret. To keep it away from people 
so it cannot do its evil. I lost my job. My family. I lost everything because of it. 
But I am determined to keep the camera where it can do no harm.” 

He stopped pacing, with his back toward them. He stood silently, shoulders 
hunched, lost in thought. 

Greg quickly climbed to his feet and motioned for Shari to do the same. 
“Well... uh... I guess it’s good we returned it,” he said hesitantly. “Sorry we 
caused so much trouble.” 

“Yeah, we’re very sorry,” Shari repeated sincerely. “Guess it’s back in the 
right hands.” 

“Good-bye,” Greg said, starting toward the steps. “It’s getting late, and we 

“No!” Dr. Fredericks shouted, startling them both. He moved quickly to 
block the way. “I’m afraid you can’t go. You know too much.” 



30 


“I can never let you leave,” Dr. Fredericks said, his face flickering in the blue 
glow of a lightning flash. He crossed his bony arms in front of his black 
sweatshirt. 

“But we won’t tell anyone,” Greg said, his voice rising until the words 
became a plea. “Really.” 

“Your secret is good with us,” Shari insisted, her frightened eyes on Greg. 

Dr. Fredericks stared at them menacingly but didn’t reply. 

“You can trust us,” Greg said, his voice quavering. He cast a frightened 
glance at Shari. 

“Besides,” Shari said, “even if we did tell anyone, who would believe us?” 

“Enough talk,” Dr. Fredericks snapped. “It won’t do you any good. I’ve 
worked too long and too hard to keep the camera a secret.” 

A rush of wind pushed against the windows, sending up a low howl. The 
wind carried a drumroll of rain. The sky through the basement windows was as 
black as night. 

“You—can’t keep us here forever!” Shari cried, unable to keep the growing 
terror from her voice. 

The rain pounded against the windows now, a steady downpour. 

Dr. Fredericks drew himself up straight, seemed to grow taller. His tiny 
eyes burned into Shari’s. “I’m so sorry,” he said, his voice a whisper of regret. 
“So sorry. But I have no choice.” 

He took another step toward them. 

Greg and Shari exchanged frightened glances. From where they stood, in 
front of the low plywood table in the center of the basement, the steps seemed a 
hundred miles away. 

“Wh-what are you going to do?” Greg cried, shouting over a burst of 
thunder that rattled the basement windows. 

“Please!” Shari begged. “Don’t!” 

Dr. Fredericks moved forward with surprising speed. Holding the camera in 
one hand, he grabbed Greg’s shoulder with the other. 

“No!” Greg screamed. “Let go!” 

“Let go of him!” Shari screamed. 



She suddenly realized that both of Dr. Fredericks’ hands were occupied. 

This may be my only chance, she thought. 

She took a deep breath and lunged forward. 

Dr. Fredericks’ eyes bulged, and he cried out in surprise as Shari grabbed 
the camera with both hands and pulled it away from him. He made a frantic grab 
for the camera, and Greg burst free. 

Before the desperate man could take another step, Shari raised the camera 
to her eye and pointed the lens at him. 

“Please—no! Don’t push the button!” the old man cried. 

He lurched forward, his eyes wild, and grabbed the camera with both hands. 

Greg stared in horror as Shari and Dr. Fredericks grappled, both holding on 
to the camera, each trying desperately to wrestle it away from the other. 

FLASH! 

The bright burst of light startled them all. 

Shari grabbed the camera. “Run!” she screamed. 



31 


The basement became a whirring blur of grays and blacks as Greg hurtled 
himself toward the stairs. 

He and Shari ran side by side, slipping over the food cartons, jumping over 
tin cans and empty bottles. 

Rain thundered against the windows. The wind howled, pushing against the 
glass. They could hear Dr. Fredericks’ anguished screams behind them. 

“Did it take our picture or his?” Shari asked. 

“I don’t know. Just hurryl” Greg screamed. 

The old man was howling like a wounded animal, his cries competing with 
the rain and wind pushing at the windows. 

The stairs weren’t that far away. But it seemed to take forever to reach 
them. 

Forever. 

Forever, Greg thought. Dr. Fredericks wanted to keep Shari and me down 
there forever. 

Panting loudly, they both reached the dark stairway. A deafening clap of 
thunder made them stop and turn around. 

“Huh?” Greg cried aloud. 

To his shock, Dr. Fredericks hadn’t chased after them. 

And his anguished cries had stopped. 

The basement was silent. 

“What’s going on?” Shari cried breathlessly. 

Squinting back into the darkness, it took Greg a while to realize that the 
dark, rumpled form lying on the floor in front of the worktable was Dr. 
Fredericks. 

“What happened?” Shari cried, her chest heaving as she struggled to catch 
her breath. Still clinging to the camera strap, she gaped in surprise at the old 
man’s still body, sprawled on its back on the floor. 

“I don’t know,” Greg replied in a breathless whisper. 

Reluctantly, Greg started back toward Dr. Fredericks. Following close 
behind, Shari uttered a low cry of horror when she clearly saw the fallen man’s 
face. 



Eyes bulged out, the mouth open in a twisted O of terror, the face stared up 
at them. Frozen. Dead. 

Dr. Fredericks was dead. 

“What— happened ?” Shari finally managed to say, swallowing hard, 
forcing herself to turn away from the ghastly, tortured face. 

“I think he died of fright,” Greg replied, squeezing her shoulder and not 
even realizing it. 

“Huh? Fright?” 

“He knew better than anyone what the camera could do,” Greg said. “When 
you snapped his picture, I think... I think it scared him to death]” 

“I only wanted to throw him off guard,” Shari cried. “I only wanted to give 
us a chance to escape. I didn’t think—” 

“The picture,” Greg interrupted. “Fet’s see the picture.” 

Shari raised the camera. The photo was still half inside the camera. Greg 
pulled it out with a trembling hand. He held it up so they could both see it. 

“Wow,” he exclaimed quietly. “Wow.” 

The photo showed Dr. Fredericks lying on the floor, his eyes bulging, his 
mouth frozen open in horror. 

Dr. Fredericks’ fright, Greg realized—the fright that had killed him—was 
there, frozen on film, frozen on his face. 

The camera had claimed another victim. This time forever. 

“What do we do now?” Shari asked, staring down at the figure sprawled at 
their feet. 

“First, I’m putting this camera back,” Greg said, taking it from her and 
shoving it back on its shelf. He turned the vise handle, and the door to the secret 
compartment closed. 

Greg breathed a sigh of relief. Hiding the dreadful camera away made him 
feel so much better. 

“Now, let’s go home and call the police,” he said. 

Two days later, a cool, bright day with a gentle breeze rustling the trees, the four 
friends stopped at the curb, leaning on their bikes, and stared up at the Coffman 
house. Even in bright sunlight, the old trees that surrounded the house covered it 
in shade. 

“So you didn’t tell the police about the camera?” Bird asked, staring up at 
the dark, empty front window. 



“No. They wouldn’t believe it,” Greg told him. “Besides, the camera should 
stay locked up forever. Forever! I hope no one ever finds out about it.” 

“We told the police we ran into the house to get out of the rain,” Shari 
added. “And we said we started to explore while we waited for the storm to blow 
over. And we found the body in the basement.” 

“What did Spidey die of?” Michael asked, gazing up at the house. 

“The police said it was heart failure,” Greg told him. “But we know the 
truth.” 

“Wow. I can’t believe one old camera could do so much evil,” Bird said. 

“I believe it,” Greg said quietly. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Michael urged. He raised his sneakers to the pedals 
and started to roll away. “This place really creeps me out.” 

The other three followed, pedaling away in thoughtful silence. 

They had turned the corner and were heading up the next block when two 
figures emerged from the back door of the Coffman house. Joey Ferris and 
Mickey Ward stepped over the weed-choked lawn onto the driveway. 

“Those jerks aren’t too bright,” Joey told his companion. “They never even 
saw us the other day. Never saw us watching them through the basement 
window.” 

Mickey laughed. “Yeah. They’re jerks.” 

“They couldn’t hide this camera from us. No way, man,” Joey said. He 
raised the camera and examined it. 

“Take my picture,” Mickey demanded. “Come on. Let’s try it out.” 

“Yeah. Okay.” Joey raised the viewfinder to his eye. “Say cheese.” 

A click. A flash. A whirring sound. 

Joey pulled the snapshot from the camera, and both boys eagerly huddled 
around it, waiting to see what developed. 





THE CURSE OF THE 
MUMMY’S TOMB 
Goosebumps - 05 
R.L. Stine 


1 


I saw the Great Pyramid and got thirsty. 

Maybe it was all the sand. So dry and yellow, it seemed to stretch on 
forever. It even made the sky look dry. 

I poked my mom in the side. “Mom, I’m really thirsty.” 

“Not now,” she said. She had one hand up on her forehead, shielding 
her eyes from the bright sun as she stared up at the enormous pyramid. 

Not now? 

What does “not now” mean? I was thirsty. Now! 

Someone bumped me from behind and apologized in a foreign 
language. I never dreamed when I saw the Great Pyramid there’d be so 
many other tourists. I guess half the people in the world decided to spend 
their Christmas vacation in Egypt this year. 

“But, Mom—” I said. I didn’t mean to whine. It was just that my throat 
was so dry. “I’m really thirsty.” 

“We can’t get you a drink now,” she answered, staring at the pyramid. 
“Stop acting like you’re four. You’re twelve, remember?” 

“Twelve-year-olds get thirsty, too,” I muttered. “All this sand in the air, 
it’s making me gag.” 

“Look at the pyramid,” she said, sounding a little irritated. “That’s why 
we came here. We didn’t come here to get a drink.” 

“But I’m choking !” I cried, gasping and holding my throat. 

Okay, so I wasn’t choking. I exaggerated a little, just trying to get her 
attention. But she pulled the brim of her straw hat down and continued to 
stare up at the pyramid, which shimmered in the heat. 

I decided to try my dad. As usual, he was studying the handful of 
guidebooks he always carried everywhere. I don’t think he’d even looked at 
the pyramid yet. He always misses everything because he always has his 
nose buried in a guidebook. 

“Dad, I’m really thirsty,” I said, whispering as if my throat were 
strained to get my message across. 

“Wow. Do you know how wide the pyramid is?” he asked, staring at a 
picture of the pyramid in his book. 



“I’m thirsty, Dad.” 

“It’s thirteen acres wide, Gabe,” he said, really excited. “Do you know 
what it’s made of?” 

I wanted to say Silly Putty. 

He’s always testing me. Whenever we go on a trip, he always asks me 
a million questions like that. I don’t think I’ve ever answered one right. 

“Some kind of stone?” I answered. 

“That’s right.” He smiled at me, then turned back to his book. “It’s 
made of limestone. Limestone blocks. It says here that some of the blocks 
weigh up to a thousand tons.” 

“Whoa,” I said. “That’s more than you and Mom put together!” 

He turned his eyes from the book and frowned at me. “Not funny, 
Gabe.” 

“Just kidding,” I said. Dad’s a little sensitive about his weight, so I try 
to tease him about it as often as I can. 

“How do you think the ancient Egyptians moved stones that weighed a 
thousand tons?” he asked. 

Quiz time wasn’t over. 

I took a guess. “In trucks?” 

He laughed. “Trucks? They didn’t have the wheel” 

I shielded my eyes and stared up at the pyramid. It was really huge, 
much bigger than it looks in pictures. And much dryer. 

I couldn’t imagine how they pulled those big stones across the sand 
without wheels. “I don’t know,” I confessed. “I’m really thirsty.” 

“No one knows how they did it,” Dad said. 

So it was a trick question. 

“Dad, I really need a drink.” 

“Not now,” he said. He squinted at the pyramid. “Gives you a funny 
feeling, doesn’t it?” 

“It gives me a thirsty feeling,” I said, trying to get my point across. 

“No. I mean, it gives me a funny feeling to think that our ancestors— 
yours and mine, Gabe—may have walked around these pyramids, or even 
helped to build them. It gives me kind of a chill. How about you?” 

“I guess,” I told him. He was right. It was kind of exciting. 

We’re Egyptian, you see. I mean, both sets of my grandparents came 
from Egypt. They moved to the United States around 1930. My mom and 



dad were both born in Michigan. We were all very excited to see the 
country our ancestors came from. 

“I wonder if your uncle Ben is down inside that pyramid right now,” 
Dad said, shielding his eyes from the sun with one hand. 

Uncle Ben Hassad. I had nearly forgotten about my uncle, the famous 
archaeologist. Uncle Ben was another one of the reasons we had decided to 
come to Egypt over the holidays. That and the fact that my mom and dad 
had some business to do in Cairo and Alexandria and some other places. 

Mom and Dad have their own business. They sell refrigeration 
equipment. It usually isn’t very exciting. But sometimes they travel to neat 
places, like Egypt, and I get to go with them. 

I turned my eyes to the pyramids and thought about my uncle. 

Uncle Ben and his workers were digging around in the Great Pyramid, 
exploring and discovering new mummies, I guess. He had always been 
fascinated by our ancestors’ homeland. He had lived in Egypt for many 
years. Uncle Ben was an expert on pyramids and mummies. I even saw his 
picture once in National Geographic. 

“When are we going to see Uncle Ben?” I asked, tugging Dad’s arm. I 
accidentally tugged too hard, and the guidebooks fell out of his hands. 

I helped him pick them up. 

“Not today,” Dad said, making a face. He didn’t like to bend over to 
pick up things. His stomach got in the way. “Ben’s going to meet us in 
Cairo in a few days.” 

“Why don’t we go up to the pyramid and see if he’s there now?” I 
asked impatiently. 

“We’re not allowed,” Dad replied. 

“Look—camels!” Mom poked me on the shoulder and pointed. 

Sure enough, some people had arrived on camels. One of the camels 
seemed to be having a coughing fit. I guess he was thirsty, too. The people 
riding the camels were tourists and they looked very uncomfortable. They 
didn’t seem to know what to do next. 

“Do you know how to get down from a camel?” I asked my dad. 

He was squinting at the pyramid, studying the top of it. “No. How?” 

“You don’t get down from a camel,” I said. “You get down from a 
duck.” 

I know. I know. It’s a very old joke. But my dad and I never get tired 



of it. 

“Do you see the camels?” Mom asked. 

“I’m not blind,” I replied. Being thirsty always puts me in a bad mood. 
Besides, what was so exciting about camels? They were really gross¬ 
looking, and they smelled like my gym socks after a basketball game. 

“What’s your problem?” Mom asked, fiddling with her straw hat. 

“I told you,” I said, not meaning to sound so angry. “I’m thirsty.” 

“Gabe, really.” She glanced at Dad, then went back to staring at the 
pyramid. 

“Dad, do you think Uncle Ben can take us inside the pyramid?” I 
asked enthusiastically. “That would really be outstanding.” 

“No, I don’t think so,” he said. He tucked his guidebooks into his 
armpit so he could raise his binoculars to his eyes. “I really don’t think so, 
Gabe. I don’t think it’s allowed.” 

I couldn’t hide my disappointment. I had all these fantasies about 
going down into the pyramid with my uncle, discovering mummies and 
ancient treasures. Fighting off ancient Egyptians who had come back to life 
to defend their sacred tomb, and escaping after a wild chase, just like 
Indiana Jones. 

“I’m afraid you’ll just have to appreciate the pyramid from the 
outside,” Dad said, peering over the yellow sand, trying to focus the 
binoculars. 

“I’ve already appreciated it,” I told him glumly. “Can we go get a 
drink now?” 

Little did I know that in a few days, Mom and Dad would be gone, and 
I would be deep inside the pyramid we were staring at. Not just inside it, 
but trapped inside it, sealed inside it—probably forever.

We drove from al-Jizah back to Cairo in the funny little rental car Dad had 
picked up at the airport. It wasn’t a long drive, but it seemed long to me. 
The car was just a little bit bigger than some of my old remote-control cars, 
and my head hit the ceiling with every bump. 

I’d brought my Game Boy with me, but Mom made me put it away so 
that I could watch the Nile as the road followed along its bank. It was very 
wide and very brown. 

“No one else in your class is seeing the Nile this Christmas,” Mom 
said, the hot wind blowing her brown hair through the open car window. 

“Can I play with my Game Boy now?” I asked. 

I mean, when you get right down to it, a river is a river. 

An hour or so later, we were back in Cairo with its narrow, crowded 
streets. Dad made a wrong turn and drove us into some kind of market, and 
we were trapped in a little alley behind a herd of goats for nearly half an 
hour. 

I didn’t get a drink till we got back to the hotel, and by that time, my 
tongue was the size of a salami and hanging down to the floor just like 
Elvis’. He’s our cocker spaniel back home. 

I’ll say one nice thing about Egypt. The Coke tastes just as good as the 
Coke back home. It’s the Classic Coke, too, not the other kind. And they 
give you plenty of ice, which I like to crunch with my teeth. 

We had a suite at the hotel, two bedrooms and a sort of living room. If 
you looked out the window, you could see a tall, glass skyscraper across the 
street, just like you’d see in any city. 

There was a TV in the living room, but everyone spoke Arabic on it. 
The shows didn’t look too interesting, anyway. Mainly a lot of news. The 
only channel in English was CNN. But that was news, too. 

We had just started to talk about where to go for dinner when the 
phone rang. Dad went into the bedroom to answer it. A few minutes later he 
called Mom in, and I could hear the two of them discussing something. 

They were talking very quietly, so I figured it had something to do 
with me and they didn’t want me to hear it. 



As usual, I was right. 

They both came out of the bedroom a few minutes later, looking kind 
of worried. My first thought was that my grandmother had called to say that 
something bad had happened to Elvis back home. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked. “Who called?” 

“Your dad and I have to go to Alexandria. Right away,” Mom said, 
sitting down beside me on the couch. 

“Huh? Alexandria?” We weren’t supposed to go there until the end of 
the week. 

“Business,” Dad said. “An important customer wants to meet with us 
first thing tomorrow morning.” 

“We have to take a plane that leaves in an hour,” Mom said. 

“But I don’t want to,” I told them, jumping up from the couch. “I want 
to stay in Cairo and see Uncle Ben. I want to go to the pyramids with him. 
You promised!” 

We argued about it for a short while. They tried to convince me there 
were a lot of cool things to see in Alexandria, but I held my ground. 

Finally, Mom had an idea. She went into the bedroom, and I heard her 
making a phone call to someone. A few minutes later, she came back with a 
smile on her face. “I talked to Uncle Ben,” she announced. 

“Wow! Do they have phones in the pyramid?” I asked. 

“No. I talked to him at the small lodge he’s staying at in al-Jizah,” she 
replied. “He said he’d come and take care of you, if you want. While your 
dad and I are in Alexandria.” 

“Yeah?” This was starting to sound outstanding. Uncle Ben is one of 
the coolest guys I’ve ever known. Sometimes I couldn’t believe he was 
Mom’s brother. 

“It’s your choice, Gabe,” she said, glancing at my dad. “You can come 
with us, or you can stay with Ben till we get back.” 

Some choice. 

I didn’t have to think about it for more than one-eighteenth of a 
second. “I’ll stay with Uncle Ben!” I declared. 

“One other thing,” Mom said, grinning for some reason. “You might 
want to think about this.” 

“I don’t care what it is,” I insisted. “I choose Uncle Ben.” 

“Sari is also on Christmas vacation,” Mom said. “And she’s staying 



with him, too.” 

“Barf!” I cried, and I flung myself down on the couch and began 
pounding the cushions with both fists. 

Sari is Uncle Ben’s stuck-up daughter. My only cousin. She’s the same 
age as me—twelve—and she thinks she’s so great. She goes to boarding 
school in the United States while her dad works in Egypt. 

She’s really pretty, and she knows it. And she’s smart. And the last 
time I saw her, she was an inch taller than me. 

That was last Christmas, I guess. She thought she was really hot stuff 
because she could get to the last level of Super Mario Land. But it wasn’t 
fair because I don’t have Super Nintendo, only regular Nintendo. So I never 
get to practice. 

I think that’s what she liked about me best, that she could beat me at 
games and things. Sari is the most competitive person I know. She has to be 
first and best at everything. If everyone around is catching the flu, she has 
to be the first one to catch it! 

“Stop pounding the couch like that,” Mom said. She grabbed my arm 
and pulled me to my feet. 

“Does that mean you changed your mind? You’re coming with us?” 
Dad asked. 

I thought about it. “No. I’ll stay here with Uncle Ben,” I decided. 

“And you won’t fight with Sari?” Mom asked. 

“She fights with me,” I said. 

“Your mom and I have got to hurry,” Dad said. 

They disappeared into the bedroom to pack. I turned on the TV and 
watched some kind of game show in Arabic. The contestants kept laughing 
a lot. I couldn’t figure out why. I hardly know a word of Arabic. 

After a while, Mom and Dad came out again, dragging suitcases. 
“We’ll never get to the airport in time,” Dad said. 

“I talked to Ben,” Mom told me, brushing her hair with her hand. 
“He’ll be here in an hour, hour and a half. Gabe, you don’t mind staying 
alone here for just an hour, do you?” 

“Huh?” 

Not much of an answer, I’ll admit. But her question caught me by 
surprise. 

I mean, it never occurred to me that my own parents would leave me 



all alone in a big hotel in a strange city where I didn’t even know the 
language. I mean, how could they do that to me? 

“No problem,” I said. “I’ll be fine. I’ll just watch TV till he comes.” 

“Ben’s on his way already,” Mom said. “He and Sari will be here in no 
time. And I phoned down to the hotel manager. He said he’d have someone 
look in on you from time to time.” 

“Where’s the bellhop?” Dad asked, nervously pacing to the door and 
back. “I called down there ten minutes ago.” 

“Just stay here and wait for Ben, okay?” Mom said to me, walking up 
behind the couch, leaning over, and squeezing my ears. For some reason, 
she thinks I like that. “Don’t go out or anything. Just wait right here for 
him.” She bent down and kissed me on the forehead. 

“I won’t move,” I promised. “I’ll stay right here on the couch. I won’t 
go to the bathroom or anything.” 

“Can’t you ever be serious?” Mom asked, shaking her head. 

There was a loud knock on the door. The bellhop, a bent-over old man 
who didn’t look as if he could pick up a feather pillow, had arrived to take 
the bags. 

Mom and Dad, looking very worried, gave me hugs and more final 
instructions, and told me once again to stay in the room. The door closed 
behind them, and it was suddenly very quiet. 

Very quiet. 

I turned up the TV just to make it a little noisier. The game show had 
gone off, and now a man in a white suit was reading the news in Arabic. 

“I’m not scared,” I said aloud. But I had kind of a tight feeling in my 
throat. 

I walked to the window and looked out. The sun was nearly down. The 
shadow of the skyscraper slanted over the street and onto the hotel. 

I picked up my Coke glass and took a sip. It was watery and flat. My 
stomach growled. I suddenly realized that I was hungry. 

Room service, I thought. 

Then I decided I’d better not. What if I called and they only spoke 
Arabic? 

I glanced at the clock. Seven-twenty. I wished Uncle Ben would arrive. 

I wasn’t scared. I just wished he’d arrive. 

Okay. Maybe I was a little nervous. 



I paced back and forth for a bit. I tried playing Tetris on the Game Boy, 
but I couldn’t concentrate, and the light wasn’t very good. 

Sari is probably a champ at Tetris, I thought bitterly. Where were they? 
What was taking so long? 

I began to have horrible, frightening thoughts: What if they can’t find 
the hotel? What if they get mixed up and go to the wrong hotel? 

What if they’re in a terrible car crash and die? And I’m all by myself 
in Cairo for days and days? 

I know. They were dumb thoughts. But they’re the kind of thoughts 
you have when you’re alone in a strange place, waiting for someone to 
come. 

I glanced down and realized I had taken the mummy hand out of my 
jeans pocket. 

It was small, the size of a child’s hand. A little hand wrapped in papery 
brown gauze. I had bought it at a garage sale a few years ago, and I always 
carried it around as a good luck charm. 

The kid who sold it to me called it a “Summoner.” He said it was used 
to summon evil spirits, or something. I didn’t care about that. I just thought 
it was an outstanding bargain for two dollars. I mean, what a great thing to 
find at a garage sale! And maybe it was even real. 

I tossed it from hand to hand as I paced the length of the living room. 
The TV was starting to make me nervous, so I clicked it off. 

But now the quiet was making me nervous. 

I slapped the mummy hand against my palm and kept pacing. 

Where were they? They should’ve been here by now. 

I was beginning to think that I’d made the wrong choice. Maybe I 
should’ve gone to Alexandria with Mom and Dad. 

Then I heard a noise at the door. Footsteps. 

Was it them? 

I stopped in the middle of the living room and listened, staring past the 
narrow front hallway to the door. 

The light was dim in the hallway, but I saw the doorknob turn. 

That’s strange, I thought. Uncle Ben would knock first—wouldn’t he? 

The doorknob turned. The door started to creak open. 

“Hey—” I called out, but the word choked in my throat. 

Uncle Ben would knock. He wouldn’t just barge in. 



Slowly, slowly, the door squeaked open as I stared, frozen in the 
middle of the room, unable to call out. 

Standing in the doorway was a tall, shadowy figure. 

I gasped as the figure lurched into the room, and I saw it clearly. Even 
in the dim light, I could see what it was. 

A mummy. 

Glaring at me with round, dark eyes through holes in its ancient, thick 
bandages. 

A mummy. 

Pushing itself off the wall and staggering stiffly toward me into the 
living room, its arms outstretched as if to grab me. 

I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. 



3 


I took a step back, and then another. Without realizing it, I’d raised my little 
mummy hand in the air, as if trying to fend off the intruder with it. 

As the mummy staggered into the light, I stared into its deep, dark 

eyes. 

And recognized them. 

“Uncle Ben!” I screamed. 

Angrily, I heaved the mummy hand at him. It hit his bandaged chest 
and bounced off. 

He collapsed backwards against the wall, laughing that booming laugh 
of his. 

And then I saw Sari poking her head in the doorway. She was 
laughing, too. 

They both thought it was hilarious. But my heart was pounding so 
hard, I thought it was going to pop out of my chest. 

“That wasn’t funny!” I shouted angrily, balling my hands into fists at 
my sides. I took a deep breath, then another, trying to get my breathing to 
return to normal. 

“I told you he’d be scared,” Sari said, walking into the room, a big, 
superior grin on her face. 

Uncle Ben was laughing so hard, he had tears running down his 
bandaged face. He was a big man, tall and broad, and his laughter shook the 
room. “You weren’t that scared—were you, Gabe?” 

“I knew it was you,” I said, my heart still pounding as if it were a 
windup toy someone had wound up too tight. “I recognized you right 
away.” 

“You sure looked scared,” Sari insisted. 

“I didn’t want to spoil the joke,” I replied, wondering if they could see 
how terrified I really was. 

“You should’ve seen the look on your face!” Uncle Ben cried, and 
started laughing all over again. 

“I told Daddy he shouldn’t do it,” Sari said, dropping down onto the 
couch. “I’m amazed the hotel people let him come up dressed like that.” 



Unde Ben bent down and picked up the mummy hand I had tossed at 
him. “You’re used to me and my practical jokes, right, Gabe?” 

“Yeah,” I said, avoiding his eyes. 

Secretly, I scolded myself for falling for his stupid costume. I was 
always falling for his dumb jokes. Always. And, now, there was Sari 
grinning at me from the couch, knowing I was so scared that I’d practically 
had a cow. 

Uncle Ben pulled some of the bandages away from his face. He 
stepped over and handed the little mummy hand back to me. “Where’d you 
get that?” he asked. 

“Garage sale,” I told him. 

I started to ask him if it was real, but he surrounded me in a big bear 
hug. The gauze felt rough against my cheek. “Good to see you, Gabe,” he 
said softly. “You’ve grown taller.” 

“Almost as tall as me,” Sari chimed in. 

Uncle Ben motioned to her. “Get up and help me pull this stuff off.” 

“I kind of like the way you look in it,” Sari said. 

“Get over here,” Uncle Ben insisted. 

Sari got up with a sigh, tossing her straight black hair behind her 
shoulders. She walked over to her dad and started unraveling the bandages. 

“I got a little carried away with this mummy thing, Gabe,” Uncle Ben 
admitted, resting his arm on my shoulder as Sari continued working. “But 
it’s just because I’m so excited about what’s going on at the pyramid.” 

“What’s going on?” I asked eagerly. 

“Daddy’s discovered a whole new burial chamber,” Sari broke in 
before her dad had a chance to tell me himself. “He’s exploring parts of the 
pyramid that have been undiscovered for thousands of years.” 

“Really?” I cried. “That’s outstanding!” 

Uncle Ben chuckled. “Wait till you see it.” 

“See it?” I wasn’t sure what he meant. “You mean you’re going to take 
me into the pyramid?” 

My voice was so high that only dogs could hear it. But I didn’t care. I 
couldn’t believe my good luck. I was actually going inside the Great 
Pyramid, into a section that hadn’t been discovered until now. 

“I have no choice,” Uncle Ben said dryly. “What else am I going to do 
with you two?” 



“Are there mummies in there?” I asked. “Will we see actual 
mummies?” 

“Do you miss your mummy?” Sari said, her lame idea of a joke. 

I ignored her. “Is there treasure down there, Uncle Ben? Egyptian 
relics? Are there wall paintings?” 

“Let’s talk about it at dinner,” he said, tugging off the last of the 
bandages. He was wearing a plaid sportshirt and baggy chinos under all the 
gauze. “Come on. I’m starving.” 

“Race you downstairs,” Sari said, and shoved me out of the way to 
give herself a good head start out of the room. 

We ate downstairs in the hotel restaurant. There were palm trees painted on 
the walls, and miniature palm trees planted in big pots all around the 
restaurant. Large wooden ceiling fans whirled slowly overhead. 

The three of us sat in a large booth, Sari and I across from Uncle Ben. 
We studied the long menus. They were printed in Arabic and English. 

“Listen to this, Gabe,” Sari said, a smug smile on her face. She began 
to read the Arabic words aloud. 

What a show-off. 

The white-suited waiter brought a basket of flat pita bread and a bowl 
of green stuff to dip the bread in. I ordered a club sandwich and Lrench 
fries. Sari ordered a hamburger. 

Later, as we ate our dinner, Uncle Ben explained a little more about 
what he had discovered at the pyramid. “As you probably know,” he 
started, tearing off a chunk of the flat bread, “the pyramid was built some 
time around 2500 B.C., during the reign of the Pharaoh Khufu.” 

“Gesundheit,” Sari said. Another lame joke. 

Her father chuckled. I made a face at her. 

“It was the biggest structure of its time,” Uncle Ben said. “Do you 
know how wide the base of the pyramid is?” 

Sari shook her head. “No. How wide?” she asked with a mouthful of 
hamburger. 

“I know,” I said, grinning. “It’s thirteen acres wide.” 

“Hey—that’s right!” Uncle Ben exclaimed, obviously impressed. 

Sari flashed me a surprised look. 

That’s one for me! I thought happily, sticking my tongue out at her. 



And one for my dad’s guidebooks. 

“The pyramid was built as a royal burial place,” Uncle Ben continued, 
his expression turning serious. “The Pharaoh made it really enormous so 
that the burial chamber could be hidden. The Egyptians worried about tomb 
robbers. They knew that people would try to break in and take all of the 
valuable jewels and treasures that were buried alongside their owners. So 
they built dozens of tunnels and chambers inside, a confusing maze to keep 
robbers from finding the real burial room.” 

“Pass the ketchup, please,” Sari interrupted. I passed her the ketchup. 

“Sari’s heard all this before,” Uncle Ben said, dipping the pita bread 
into the dark gravy on his plate. “Anyway, we archaeologists thought we’d 
uncovered all of the tunnels and rooms inside this pyramid. But a few days 
ago, my workers and I discovered a tunnel that isn’t on any of the charts. 
An unexplored, undiscovered tunnel. And we think this tunnel may lead us 
to the actual burial chamber of Khufu himself!” 

“Outstanding!” I exclaimed. “And Sari and I will be there when you 
discover it?” 

Uncle Ben chuckled. “I don’t know about that, Gabe. It may take us 
years of careful exploration. But I’ll take you down into the tunnel 
tomorrow. Then you can tell your friends you were actually inside the 
ancient pyramid of Khufu.” 

“I’ve already been in it,” Sari bragged. She turned her eyes to me. “It’s 
very dark. You might get scared.” 

“No, I won’t,” I insisted. “No way.” 

The three of us spent the night in my parents’ hotel room. It took me hours 
to get to sleep. I guess I was excited about going into the pyramid. I kept 
imagining that we found mummies and big chests of ancient jewels and 
treasure. 

Uncle Ben woke us up early the next morning, and we drove out to the 
pyramid outside al-Jizah. The air was already hot and sticky. The sun 
seemed to hang low over the desert like an orange balloon. 

“There it is!” Sari declared, pointing out the window. And I saw the 
Great Pyramid rising up from the yellow sand like some kind of mirage. 

Uncle Ben showed a special permit to the blue-uniformed guard, and 
we followed a narrow, private road that curved through the sand behind the 



pyramid. We parked beside several other cars and vans in the blue-gray 
shadow of the pyramid. 

As I stepped out of the car, my chest was thudding with excitement. I 
stared up at the enormous, worn stones of the Great Pyramid. 

It’s over four thousand years old, I thought. I’m about to go inside 
something that was built four thousand years ago! 

“Your sneaker’s untied,” Sari said, pointing. 

She sure knew how to bring a guy back down to earth. 

I bent in the sand to tie my sneaker. For some reason, the left one was 
always coming untied, even when I double-knotted it. 

“My workers are already inside,” Uncle Ben told us. “Now, stick close 
together, okay? Don’t wander off. The tunnels really are like a maze. It’s 
very easy to get lost.” 

“No problem,” I said, my trembling voice revealing how nervous and 
excited I was. 

“Don’t worry. I’ll keep an eye on Gabe, Dad,” Sari said. 

She was only two months older than me. Why did she have to act like 
she was my baby-sitter or something? 

Uncle Ben handed us both flashlights. “Clip them onto your jeans as 
we go in,” he instructed. He gazed at me. “You don’t believe in curses, do 
you? You know—the ancient Egyptian kind.” 

I didn’t know how to reply, so I shook my head. 

“Good,” Uncle Ben replied, grinning. “Because one of my workers 
claims we’ve violated an ancient decree by entering this new tunnel, and 
that we’ve activated some curse.” 

“We’re not scared,” Sari said, giving him a playful shove toward the 
entrance. “Get going, Dad.” 

And seconds later, we were stepping into the small, square opening cut 
into the stone. Stooping low, I followed them through a narrow tunnel that 
seemed to slope gradually down. 

Uncle Ben led the way, lighting the ground with a bright halogen 
flashlight. The pyramid floor was soft and sandy. The air was cool and 
damp. 

“The walls are granite,” Uncle Ben said, stopping to rub a hand along 
the low ceiling. “All of the tunnels were made of limestone.” 

The temperature dropped suddenly. The air felt even wetter. I suddenly 



realized why Uncle Ben had made us wear our sweatshirts. 

“If you’re scared, we can go back,” Sari said. 

“I’m fine,” I replied quickly. 

The tunnel ended abruptly. A pale yellow wall rose up in front of us. 
Ben’s flashlight darted over a small, dark hole in the floor. 

“Down we go,” Ben said, groaning as he dropped to his knees. He 
turned back to me. “Afraid there are no stairs down to the new tunnel. My 
workers installed a rope ladder. Just take your time on it, take it slowly, one 
mng at a time, and you’ll be fine.” 

“No problem,” I said. But my voice cracked. 

“Don’t look down,” Sari advised. “It might make you dizzy, and you’ll 

fall.” 

“Thanks for the encouragement,” I told her. I pushed my way past her. 
“I’ll go down first,” I said. I was already tired of her acting so superior. I 
decided to show her who was brave and who wasn’t. 

“No. Let me go first,” Uncle Ben said, raising a hand to stop me. 
“Then I’ll shine the light up at the ladder and help you down.” 

With another groan, he maneuvered himself into the hole. He was so 
big, he nearly didn’t fit. 

Slowly, he began to lower himself down the rope ladder. 

Sari and I leaned over the hole and peered down, watching him 
descend. The rope ladder wasn’t very steady. It swung back and forth under 
his weight as he slowly, carefully, made his way down. 

“It’s a long way down,” I said softly. 

Sari didn’t reply. In the shadowy light, I could see her worried 
expression. She was chewing on her lower lip as her dad reached the tunnel 
floor. 

She was nervous, too. 

That cheered me up a lot. 

“Okay, I’m down. You’re next, Gabe,” Uncle Ben called up to me. 

I turned and swung my feet onto the rope ladder. I grinned at Sari. 
“See ya.” 

I lowered my hands to the sides of the rope ladder—and as I slid them 
down, I cried out. 

“Ow!” 

The rope wasn’t smooth. It was coarse. It cut my hands. 



The sharp stab of pain made me lift my hands. 

And before I even realized what was happening, I started to fall. 



4 


Two hands reached down for mine. They shot through the air and grabbed 
my wrists. 

“Hold on!” Sari cried. 

She had slowed my fall just enough to allow me to grab back onto the 
sides of the rope ladder. 

“Oh, wow!” I managed to utter. That was the best I could do. I gripped 
the rope for dear life, waiting for my heart to stop pounding. I closed my 
eyes and didn’t move. I squeezed the ropes so hard, my hands ached. 

“Saved your life,” Sari called down to me, leaning into the opening, 
her face inches from mine. 

I opened my eyes and stared up at her. “Thanks,” I said gratefully. 

“No problem,” she replied and burst out laughing, laughing from 
relief, I guess. 

Why couldn’t I save her life? I asked myself angrily. Why can’t I ever 
be the big hero? 

“What happened, Gabe?” Uncle Ben called from the tunnel floor 
below. His booming voice echoed loudly through the chamber. The wide 
circle of light from his flashlight danced across the granite wall. 

“The rope cut my hands,” I explained. “I wasn’t expecting—” 

“Just take your time,” he said patiently. “One rung at a time, 
remember?” 

“Lower your hands. Don’t slide them,” Sari advised, her face poking 
through the hole above me. 

“Okay, okay,” I said, starting to breathe normally. 

I took a deep breath and held it. Then, slowly, carefully, I made my 
way down the long rope ladder. 

A short while later, all three of us were standing on the tunnel floor, 
holding our lighted flashlights, our eyes following the circles of light. “This 
way,” Uncle Ben said quietly, and he headed off to the right, walking 
slowly, stooping because of the low ceiling. 

Our sneakers crunched on the sandy floor. I saw another tunnel leading 
off to the right, then another tunnel on the left. 



“We’re breathing air that is four thousand years old,” Ben said, 
keeping his light aimed on the floor ahead of him. 

“Smells like it,” I whispered to Sari. She laughed. 

The air really did smell old. Kind of heavy and musty. Like someone’s 

attic. 

The tunnel widened a little as it curved to the right. 

“We’re going deeper into the earth,” Ben said. “Does it feel like you’re 
going downhill?” 

Sari and I both muttered that it did. 

“Dad and I explored one of the side tunnels yesterday,” Sari told me. 
“We found a mummy case inside a tiny room. A beautiful one in perfect 
condition.” 

“Was there a mummy inside it?” I asked eagerly. I was dying to see a 
mummy. The museum back home had only one. I’d stared at it and studied 
it all my life. 

“No. It was empty,” Sari replied. 

“Why didn’t the mummy have any hobbies?” Uncle Ben asked, 
stopping suddenly. 

“I don’t know,” I answered. 

“He was too wrapped up in his work!” Uncle Ben exclaimed. He 
laughed at his own joke. Sari and I could only muster weak smiles. 

“Don’t encourage him,” Sari told me, loud enough for her dad to hear. 
“He knows a million mummy jokes, and they’re all just as bad.” 

“Wait up. Just a sec,” I said. I bent down to tie my sneaker, which had 
come undone again. 

The tunnel curved, then divided into two tunnels. Uncle Ben led us 
through the one on the left, which was so narrow we had to squeeze through 
it, making our way sideways, heads bent, until it widened into a large, high- 
ceilinged chamber. 

I stood up straight and stretched. It felt so good not to be scrunched 
down. I stared around the large room. 

Several people came into view at the far wall, working with digging 
tools. Bright spotlights had been hung above them on the wall, attached to a 
portable generator. 

Uncle Ben brought us over to them and introduced us. There were four 
workers, two men and two women. 



Another man stood off to the side, a clipboard in his hand. He was an 
Egyptian, dressed all in white except for a red bandanna around his neck. 
He had straight black hair, slicked down and tied in a ponytail behind his 
head. He stared at Sari and me, but didn’t come over. He seemed to be 
studying us. 

“Ahmed, you met my daughter yesterday. This is Gabe, my nephew,” 
Uncle Ben called to him. 

Ahmed nodded, but didn’t smile or say anything. 

“Ahmed is from the university,” Uncle Ben explained to me in a low 
voice. “He requested permission to observe us, and I said okay. He’s very 
quiet. But don’t get him started on ancient curses. He’s the one who keeps 
warning me that I’m in deadly danger.” 

Ahmed nodded, but didn’t reply. He stared at me for a long while. 

Weird guy, I thought. 

I wondered if he’d tell me about the ancient curses. I loved stories 
about ancient curses. 

Uncle Ben turned to his workers. “So? Any progress today?” he asked. 

“We think we’re getting real close,” a young, red-haired man wearing 
faded jeans and a blue denim work shirt replied. And then he added, “Just a 
hunch.” 

Ben frowned. “Thanks, Quasimodo,” he said. 

The workers all laughed. I guess they liked Uncle Ben’s jokes. 

“Quasimodo was the Hunchback of Notre Dame,” Sari explained to 
me in her superior tone. 

“I know, I know,” I replied irritably. “I get it.” 

“We could be heading in the wrong direction altogether,” Uncle Ben 
told the workers, scratching the bald spot on the back of his head. “The 
tunnel might be over there.” He pointed to the wall on the right. 

“No, I think we’re getting warm, Ben,” a young woman, her face 
smudged with dust, said. “Come over here. I want to show you something.” 

She led him over to a large pile of stones and debris. He shined his 
light where she was pointing. Then he leaned closer to examine what she 
was showing him. 

“That’s very interesting, Christy,” Uncle Ben said, rubbing his chin. 
They fell into a long discussion. 

After a while, three other workers entered the chamber, carrying 



shovels and picks. One of them was carrying some kind of electronic 
equipment in a flat metal case. It looked a little like a laptop computer. 

I wanted to ask Uncle Ben what it was, but he was still in the corner, 
involved in his discussion with the worker named Christy. 

Sari and I wandered back toward the tunnel entrance. “I think he’s 
forgotten about us,” Sari said sullenly. 

I agreed, shining my flashlight up at the high, cracked ceiling. 

“Once he gets down here with the workers, he forgets everything but 
his work,” she said, sighing. 

“I can’t believe we’re actually inside a pyramid!” I exclaimed. 

Sari laughed. She kicked at the floor with one sneaker. “Look—ancient 
dirt,” she said. 

“Yeah.” I kicked up some of the sandy dirt, too. “I wonder who walked 
here last. Maybe an Egyptian priestess. Maybe a pharaoh. They might have 
stood right here on this spot.” 

“Let’s go exploring,” Sari said suddenly. 

“Huh?” 

Her dark eyes gleamed, and she had a really devilish look on her face. 
“Let’s go, Gabey—let’s check out some tunnels or something.” 

“Don’t call me Gabey,” I said. “Come on, Sari, you know I hate that.” 

“Sorry,” she apologized, giggling. “You coming?” 

“We can’t,” I insisted, watching Uncle Ben. He was having some kind 
of argument with the worker carrying the thing that looked like a laptop. 
“Your dad said we had to stick together. He said—” 

“He’ll be busy here for hours,” she interrupted, glancing back at him. 
“He won’t even notice we’re gone. Really.” 

“But, Sari—” I started. 

“Besides,” she continued, putting her hands on my shoulders and 
pushing me backwards toward the chamber door, “he doesn’t want us 
hanging around. We’ll only get in the way.” 

“Sari—” 

“I went exploring yesterday,” she said, pushing me with both hands. 
“We won’t go far. You can’t get lost. All the tunnels lead back to this big 
room. Really.” 

“I just don’t think we should,” I said, my eyes on Uncle Ben. He was 
down on his hands and knees now, digging against the wall with some kind 



of a pick. 

“Let go of me,” I told her. “Really. I—” 

And then she said what I knew she’d say. What she always says when 
she wants to get her way. 

“Are you chicken?” 

“No,” I insisted. “You know your dad said—” 

“Chicken? Chicken? Chicken?” She began clucking like a chicken. 
Really obnoxious. 

“Stop it, Sari.” I tried to sound tough and menacing. 

“Are you chicken, Gabey ?” she repeated, grinning at me as if she’d 
just won some big victory. “Huh, Gabey?” 

“Stop calling me that!” I insisted. 

She just stared at me. 

I made a disgusted face. “Okay, okay. Let’s go exploring,” I told her. 

I mean, what else could I say? 

“But not far,” I added. 

“Don’t worry,” she said, grinning. “We won’t get lost. I’ll just show 
you some of the tunnels I looked at yesterday. One of them has a strange 
animal picture carved on the wall. I think it’s some kind of a cat. I’m not 
sure.” 

“Really?” I cried, instantly excited. “I’ve seen pictures of relief 
carvings, but I’ve never—” 

“It may be a cat,” Sari said. “Or maybe a person with an animal head. 
It’s really weird.” 

“Where is it?” I asked. 

“Follow me.” 

We both gave one last glance back to Uncle Ben, who was down on his 
hands and knees, picking away at the stone wall. 

Then I followed Sari out of the chamber. 

We squeezed through the narrow tunnel, then turned and followed a 
slightly wider tunnel to the right. I hesitated, a few steps behind her. “Are 
you sure we’ll be able to get back?” I asked, keeping my voice low so she 
couldn’t accuse me of sounding frightened. 

“No problem,” she replied. “Keep your light on the floor. There’s a 
small chamber on the other end of this tunnel that’s kind of neat.” 

We followed the tunnel as it curved to the right. It branched into two 



low openings, and Sari took the one to the left. 

The air grew a little warmer. It smelled stale, as if people had been 
smoking cigarettes there. 

This tunnel was wider than the others. Sari was walking faster now, 
getting farther ahead of me. “Hey—wait up!” I cried. 

I looked down to see that my sneaker had come untied again. Uttering 
a loud, annoyed groan, I bent to retie it. 

“Hey, Sari, wait up!” 

She didn’t seem to hear me. 

I could see her light in the distance, growing fainter in the tunnel. 

Then it suddenly disappeared. 

Had her flashlight burned out? 

No. The tunnel probably curved, I decided. She’s just out of my view. 

“Hey, Sari!” I called. “Wait up! Wait up!” 

I stared ahead into the dark tunnel. 

“Sari?” 

Why didn’t she answer me? 



5 


“Sari!” 

My voice echoed through the long, curving tunnel. 

No reply. 

I called again, and listened to my voice fading as the echo repeated her 
name again and again. 

At first I was angry. 

I knew what Sari was doing. 

She was deliberately not answering, deliberately trying to frighten me. 

She had to prove that she was the brave one, and I was the ’fraidy cat. 

I suddenly remembered another time, a few years before. Sari and 
Uncle Ben had come to my house for a visit. I think Sari and I were seven 
or eight. 

We went outside to play. It was a gray day, threatening rain. Sari had a 
jump rope and was showing off, as usual, showing me how good she was at 
it. Then, of course, when she let me try it, I tripped and fell, and she 
laughed like crazy. 

I’d decided to get back at her by taking her to this deserted old house a 
couple blocks up the street. The kids in the neighborhood all believed the 
house was haunted. It was a neat place to sneak in and explore, although 
our parents were always warning us to stay away from it because it was 
falling apart and dangerous. 

So I led Sari to this house and told her it was haunted. And we sneaked 
in through the broken basement window. 

It got even darker out, and started to rain. It was perfect. I could tell 
Sari was really scared to be alone in the creepy old house. I, of course, 
wasn’t scared at all because I’d been there before. 

Well, we started exploring, with me leading the way. And somehow 
we got separated. And it started thundering and lightning outside. There 
was rain pouring in through the broken windows. 

I decided maybe we should get home. So I called to Sari. No answer. 

I called again. Still no answer. 

Then I heard a loud crash. 



Calling her name, I started running from room to room. I was scared to 
death. I was sure something terrible had happened. 

I ran through every room in the house, getting more and more scared. I 
couldn’t find her. I shouted and shouted, but she didn’t answer me. 

I was so scared, I started to cry. Then I totally panicked, and I ran out 
of the house and into the pouring rain. 

I ran through the thunder and lightning, crying all the way home. By 
the time I got home, I was soaked through and through. 

I ran into the kitchen, sobbing and crying that I’d lost Sari in the 
haunted house. 

And there she was. Sitting at the kitchen table. Comfortable and dry. 
Eating a big slice of chocolate cake. A smug smile on her face. 

And now, peering into the darkness of the pyramid, I knew Sari was 
doing the same thing to me. 

Trying to scare me. 

Trying to make me look bad. 

Or was she? 

As I made my way through the low, narrow tunnel, keeping the light 
aimed straight ahead, I couldn’t help it. My anger quickly turned to worry, 
and troubling questions whirred through my mind. 

What if she wasn’t playing a mean trick on me? 

What if something bad had happened to her? 

What if she had missed a step and fallen into a hole? 

Or had gotten herself trapped in a hidden tunnel? Or... I didn’t know 
what. 

I wasn’t thinking clearly. 

My sneakers thudded loudly over the sandy floor as I started to half¬ 
walk, half-jog through the winding tunnel. “Sari?” I called, frantically now, 
not caring whether I sounded frightened or not. 

Where was she? 

She wasn’t that far ahead of me. I should at least be able to see the 
light from her flashlight, I thought. 

“Sari?” 

There was no place for her to hide in this narrow space. Was I 
following the wrong tunnel? 

No. 



I had been in the same tunnel all along. The same tunnel I had watched 
her disappear in. 

Don’t say disappear, I scolded myself. Don’t even think the word. 

Suddenly the narrow tunnel ended. A small opening led into a small, 
square room. I flashed the light quickly from side to side. 

“Sari?” 

No sign of her. 

The walls were bare. The air was warm and stale. I moved the 
flashlight rapidly across the floor, looking for Sari’s footprints. The floor 
was harder, less sandy here. There were no footprints. 

“Oh!” 

I uttered a low cry when my light came to rest on the object against the 
far wall. My heart pounding, I eagerly took a few steps closer until I was 
just a few feet from it. 

It was a mummy case. 

A large, stone mummy case, at least eight feet long. 

It was rectangular, with curved corners. The lid was carved. I stepped 
closer and aimed the light. 

Yes. 

A human face was carved on the lid. The face of a woman. It looked 
like a death mask, the kind we’d studied in school. It stared wide-eyed up at 
the ceiling. 

“Wow!” I cried aloud. Areal mummy case. 

The carved face on the lid must have been brightly painted at one time. 
But the color had faded over the centuries. Now the face was gray, as pale 
as death. 

Staring at the top of the case, smooth and perfect, I wondered if Uncle 
Ben had seen it. Or if I had made a discovery of my own. 

Why is it all by itself in this small room? I wondered. 

And what does it hold inside? 

I was working up my courage to run my hand over the smooth stone of 
the lid when I heard the creaking sound. 

And saw the lid start to raise up. 

“Oh!” a hushed cry escaped my lips. 

At first I thought I had imagined it. I didn’t move a muscle. I kept the 
light trained on the lid. 



The lid lifted a tiny bit more. 

And I heard a hissing sound come from inside the big coffin, like air 
escaping a new coffee can when you first open it. 

Uttering another low cry, I took a step back. 

The lid raised up another inch. 

I took another step back. 

And dropped the flashlight. 

I picked it up with a trembling hand and shined it back onto the 
mummy case. 

The lid was now open nearly a foot. 

I sucked in a deep breath of air and held it. 

I wanted to run, but my fear was freezing me in place. 

I wanted to scream, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to make a sound. 

The lid creaked and opened another inch. 

Another inch. 

I lowered the flashlight to the opening, the light quivering with my 
hand. 

From the dark depths of the ancient coffin, I saw two eyes staring out 
at me. 



6 


I uttered a silent gasp. 

I froze. 

I felt a cold chill zigzag down my back. 

The lid slowly pushed open another inch. 

The eyes stared out at me. Cold eyes. Evil eyes. 

Ancient eyes. 

My mouth dropped open. And before I even realized it, I started to 
scream. 

Scream at the top of my lungs. 

As I screamed, unable to turn away, unable to run, unable to move, the 
lid slid open all the way. 

Slowly, as if in a dream, a dark figure raised itself from the depths of 
the mummy case and climbed out. 

“Sari!” 

Abroad smile widened across her face. Her eyes glowed gleefully. 

“Sari—that wasn’t funny!” I managed to shout in a high-pitched voice 
that bounced off the stone walls. 

But now she was laughing too hard to hear me. 

Loud, scornful laughter. 

I was so furious, I searched frantically for something to throw at her. 
But there wasn’t anything, not even a pebble on the floor. 

Staring at her, my chest still heaving from my fright, I really hated her 
then. She had made a total fool of me. There I had been, screaming like a 
baby. 

I knew she’d never let me live it down. 

Never. 

“The look on your face!” she exclaimed when she finally stopped 
laughing. “I wish I had a camera.” 

I was too angry to reply. I just growled at her. 

I pulled the little mummy hand from my back pocket and began rolling 
it around in my hand. I always fiddled with that hand when I was upset. It 



usually helped to calm me. 

But now I felt as if I’d never calm down. 

“I told you I’d found an empty mummy case yesterday,” she said, 
brushing the hair back off her face. “Didn’t you remember?” 

I growled again. 

I felt like a total dork. 

First I’d fallen for her dad’s stupid mummy costume. And now this. 

Silently to myself I vowed to pay her back. If it was the last thing I 
ever did. 

She was still chuckling about her big-deal joke. 

“The look on your face,” she said again, shaking her head. Rubbing it 
in. 

“You wouldn’t like it if I scared you,” I muttered angrily. 

“You couldn’t scare me,” she replied. “I don’t scare so easy.” 

“Hah!” 

That was the best comeback I could think of. Not very clever, I know. 
But I was too angry to be clever. 

I was imagining myself picking Sari up and tossing her back into the 
mummy case, pulling down the lid, and locking it—when I heard footsteps 
approaching in the tunnel. 

Glancing over at Sari, I saw her expression change. She heard them, 

too. 

A few seconds later, Uncle Ben burst into the small room. I could see 
immediately, even in the dim light, that he was really angry. 

“I thought I could trust you two,” he said, talking through gritted teeth. 

“Dad—” Sari started. 

But he cut her off sharply. “I trusted you not to wander off without 
telling me. Do you know how easy it is to get lost in this place? Lost 
forever?” 

“Dad,” Sari started again. “I was just showing Gabe this room I 
discovered yesterday. We were going to come right back. Really.” 

“There are hundreds of tunnels,” Uncle Ben said heatedly, ignoring 
Sari’s explanation. “Maybe thousands. Many of them have never been 
explored. No one has ever been in this section of the pyramid before. We 
have no idea what dangers there are. You two can’t just wander off by 
yourselves. Do you know how frantic I was when I turned around and you 



were gone?” 

“Sorry,” Sari and I both said in unison. 

“Let’s go,” Uncle Ben said, gesturing to the door with his flashlight. 
“Your pyramid visit is over for today.” 

We followed him into the tunnel. I felt really bad. Not only had I fallen 
for Sari’s stupid joke, but I’d made my favorite uncle really angry. 

Sari always gets me into trouble, I thought bitterly. Since we were little 

kids. 

Now she was walking ahead of me, arm in arm with her dad, telling 
him something, her face close to his ear. Suddenly they both burst out 
laughing and turned back to look at me. 

I could feel my face getting hot. 

I knew what she’d told him. 

She’d told him about hiding in the mummy case and making me 
scream like a scared baby. And now they were both chuckling about what a 
jerk I was. 

“Merry Christmas to you, too!” I called bitterly. 

And that made them laugh even harder. 


* * * 


We spent the night back in the hotel in Cairo. I beat Sari in two straight 
games of Scrabble, but it didn’t make me feel any better. 

She kept complaining that she had only vowels, and so the games 
weren’t fair. Finally, I put my Scrabble set back in my room, and we sat and 
stared at the TV. 

The next morning, we had breakfast in the room. I ordered pancakes, 
but they didn’t taste like any pancakes I’d ever eaten. They were tough and 
grainy, as if they were made of cowhide or something. 

“What are we doing today?” Sari asked Uncle Ben, who was still 
yawning and stretching after two cups of black coffee. 

“I have an appointment at the Cairo Museum,” he told us, glancing at 
his wristwatch. “It’s just a couple of blocks away. I thought you two might 
like to wander around the museum while I have my meeting.” 

“Ooh, thrills and chills,” Sari said sarcastically. She slurped up another 
spoonful of Frosted Flakes. 



The little Frosted Flakes box had Arabic writing all over it, and Tony 
the Tiger was saying something in Arabic. I wanted to save it and take it 
home to show my friends. But I knew Sari would make fun of me if I asked 
her for it, so I didn’t. 

“The museum has an interesting mummy collection, Gabe,” Uncle Ben 
said to me. He tried to pour himself a third cup of coffee, but the pot was 
empty. “You’ll like it.” 

“Unless they climb out of their cases,” Sari said. 

Lame. Really lame. 

I stuck my tongue out at her. She tossed a wet Frosted Flake across the 
table at me. 

“When are my mom and dad getting back?” I asked Uncle Ben. I 
suddenly realized I missed them. 

He started to answer, but the phone rang. He walked into the bedroom 
and picked it up. It was an old-fashioned black telephone with a dial instead 
of buttons. As he talked, his face filled with concern. 

“Change of plans,” he said a few seconds later, hanging up the receiver 
and coming back into the living room. 

“What’s the matter, Daddy?” Sari asked, shoving her cereal bowl 
away. 

“It’s very strange,” he replied, scratching the back of his head. “Two of 
my workers came down sick last night. Some kind of mysterious illness.” 
His expression became thoughtful, worried. “They took them to a hospital 
here in Cairo.” 

He started to gather up his wallet and some other belongings. “I think 
I’d better get over there right away,” he said. 

“But what about Gabe and me?” Sari asked, glancing at me. 

“I’ll only be gone an hour or so,” her dad replied. “Stay here in the 
room, okay?” 

“In the room?” Sari cried, making it sound like a punishment. 

“Well, okay. You can go down to the lobby, if you want. But don’t 
leave the hotel.” 

A few minutes later, he pulled on his tan safari jacket, checked one last 
time to make sure he had his wallet and keys, and hurried out the door. 

Sari and I stared at each other glumly. “What do you want to do?” I 
asked, poking the cold, uneaten pancakes on my plate with a fork. 



Sari shrugged. “Is it hot in here?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. It’s about a hundred and twenty.” 

“We have to get out of here,” she said, standing up and stretching. 

“You mean go down to the lobby?” I asked, still poking the pancakes, 
pulling them into pieces with the fork. 

“No. I mean get out of here,” she replied. She walked over to the 
mirror in the entranceway and began brushing her straight, black hair. 

“But Uncle Ben said—” I started. 

“We won’t go far,” she said, and then quickly added, “if you’re 
afraid.” 

I made a face at her. I don’t think she saw me. She was busy admiring 
herself in the mirror. 

“Okay,” I told her. “We could go to the museum. Your dad said it was 
just a block away.” 

I was determined not to be the wimp anymore. If she wanted to 
disobey her dad and go out, fine with me. From now on, I decided, I’ll be 
the macho guy. No repeats of yesterday—ever again. 

“The museum?” She made a face. “Well... okay,” she said, turning to 
look at me. “We’re twelve, after all. It’s not like we’re babies. We can go 
out if we want.” 

“Yes, we can,” I said. “I’ll write Uncle Ben a note and tell him where 
we’re going, in case he gets back before we do.” I went over to the desk and 
picked up a pen and a small pad of paper. 

“If you’re afraid, Gabey, we can just walk around the block,” she said 
in a teasing voice, staring at me, waiting to see how I’d react. 

“No way,” I said. “We’re going to the museum. Unless you ’re afraid.” 

“No way,” she said, imitating me. 

“And don’t call me Gabey,” I added. 

“Gabey, Gabey, Gabey,” she muttered, just to be annoying. 

I wrote the note to Uncle Ben. Then we took the elevator down to the 
lobby. We asked a young woman behind the desk where the Cairo Museum 
was. She said to turn right outside the hotel and walk two blocks. 

Sari hesitated as we stepped out into the bright sunshine. “You sure 
you’re up for this?” 

“What could go wrong?” I replied.

“Let’s go. This way,” I said, shielding my eyes from the bright sunlight with 
my hand. 

“It’s so hot,” Sari complained. 

The street was crowded and noisy. I couldn’t hear anything over the 
honking of car horns. 

Drivers here lean on their horns the minute they start up their cars, and 
they don’t stop honking till they arrive at their destinations. 

Sari and I stayed close together, making our way through the crush of 
people on the sidewalk. All kinds of people passed by. 

There were men in American-style business suits walking alongside 
men who appeared to be wearing loose-fitting white pajamas. 

We saw women who would look right at home on any street in 
America, wearing colorful leggings and stylish skirts and slacks. Women in 
jeans. Followed by women dressed in long, flowing black dresses, their 
faces covered by heavy, black veils. 

“This sure doesn’t look like back home!” I exclaimed, shouting over 
the blare of car horns. 

I was so fascinated by all the interesting-looking people crowding the 
narrow sidewalk that I forgot to look at the buildings. Before I knew it, we 
were standing in front of the museum, a tall, stone structure looming above 
the street behind steeply sloping steps. 

We climbed the steps and entered the revolving door of the museum. 

“Wow, it’s so quiet in here!” I exclaimed, whispering. It was nice to 
get away from the honking horns, the crowded sidewalks, and shouting 
people. 

“Why do you think they honk their horns so much?” Sari asked, 
holding her ears. 

“Just a custom, I guess,” I replied. 

We stopped and looked around. 

We were standing in the center of an enormous open lobby. Tall 
marble stairways rose up on the far left and far right. Twin white columns 
framed a wide doorway that led straight back. An enormous mural across 



the wall to the right showed an aerial view of the pyramids and the Nile. 

We stood in the middle of the floor, admiring the mural for a while. 
Then we made our way to the back wall and asked a woman at the 
information desk for the mummy room. She flashed us a nice smile and told 
us in perfect English to take the stairs to the right. 

Our sneakers thudded loudly over the shiny marble floor. The stairway 
seemed to go up forever. “This is like mountain climbing,” I complained, 
halfway up. 

“Race you to the top,” Sari said, grinning, and took off before I had a 
chance to reply. 

Of course she beat me by about ten steps. 

I waited for her to call me “slowpoke” or “snail face” or something. 
But she had already turned to see what lay ahead of us. 

A dark, high-ceilinged room seemed to stretch on forever. A glass case 
stood centered in the entryway. Inside was a detailed construction of wood 
and clay. 

I went up close to take a good look. The construction showed 
thousands of workers dragging enormous blocks of limestone across the 
sand toward a partially built pyramid. 

In the room behind the display I could see huge stone statues, large 
mummy cases, displays of glass and pottery, and case after case of artifacts 
and relics. 

“I think this is the place!” I exclaimed happily, rushing over to the first 
display case. 

“Ooh, what’s that? Some kind of giant dog?” Sari asked, pointing to an 
enormous statue against the wall. 

The creature appeared to have a fierce dog’s head and a lion’s body. Its 
eyes stared straight ahead, and it seemed ready to pounce on anyone who 
came near it. 

“They put creatures like that in front of tombs,” I told Sari. “You 
know. To protect the place. Scare away grave robbers.” 

“Like guard dogs,” Sari said, stepping up close to the ancient 
sculpture. 

“Hey—there’s a mummy in this case!” I exclaimed, leaning over an 
ancient stone coffin. “Look!” 

Still staring back at the enormous sculpture, Sari walked up beside me. 



“Yep. It’s a mummy, okay,” she said, unimpressed. I guess she’s seen a lot 
more of them than me. 

“It’s so small,” I said, staring at the yellowed linen wrapped so tightly 
around the skinny head and body. 

“Our ancestors were shrimps,” Sari replied. “Think it was a man or a 
woman?” 

I glanced at the plaque on the side of the coffin. “It says it’s a man.” 

“Guess they didn’t work out in those days,” she said and laughed at 
her own remark. 

“They did a great wrapping job,” I said, examining the carefully 
wrapped fingers on the hands, which were crossed over the mummy’s chest. 
“I was a mummy the Halloween before last, and my costume completely 
unraveled after ten minutes!” 

Sari tsk-tsked. 

“Do you know how they made mummies?” I asked, moving around to 
view it from the other side. “Do you know the first thing they did? They 
removed the brain.” 

“Yuck. Stop,” she said, sticking out her tongue and making a disgusted 

face. 

“Don’t you know about this?” I asked, delighted that I had some truly 
gmesome information that she didn’t. 

“Please—enough,” she said, holding up one hand as if to fend me off. 

“No, this is interesting,” I insisted. “The brain had to come out first. 
They had this special tool. It was like a long, skinny hook. They’d push it 
up the corpse’s nose until it reached the brain and then wiggled it back and 
forth, back and forth, until the brain became mush.” 

“Stop!” Sari pleaded, covering her ears. 

“Then they took a long spoon,” I continued gleefully, “and scooped the 
brain out a little at a time.” 

I made a scooping motion with my hand. “Scoop scoop. They scooped 
the brain out through the nose. Or sometimes they popped off an eyeball 
and scooped the brain out through the eyeball socket.” 

“Gabe—I mean it!” Sari cried. She really looked like she was about to 
hurl. She was green! 

I loved it. 

I never knew that Sari had a squeamish bone in her body. But I was 



really making her sick. 

Outstanding! I thought. 

I would definitely have to remember this technique. 

“It’s all true,” I told her, unable to hold back a wide grin. 

“Just shut up,” she muttered. 

“Of course sometimes they didn’t pull the brain out the nose. 
Sometimes they just sliced off the head. Then they drained the brains out 
through the neck and put the head back on the body. They just bandaged it 
back on, I guess.” 

“Gabe—” 

I’d been staring at her the whole time, checking out her reaction. She 
was looking sicker and sicker. She was breathing real heavy. Her chest was 
sort of heaving. I really thought she was going to lose her breakfast. 

If she did, I’d never let her forget it. 

“That’s really gross,” she said. Her voice sounded funny, like it was 
coming from underwater or something. 

“But it’s true,” I said. “Didn’t your dad ever tell you about how they 
made mummies?” 

She shook her head. “He knows I don’t like—” 

“And you know what they did with the guts?” I asked, enjoying the 
startled look on her face. “They put them in jars and—” 

I suddenly realized that Sari’s startled look wasn’t for me. 

She was actually staring over my shoulder. 

“Huh?” I turned around and saw why she suddenly looked so 
surprised. 

A man had entered the room and was standing just in front of the first 
display case. It took me a few seconds to recognize him. 

It was Ahmed, the strange, silent Egyptian with the black ponytail who 
had greeted us in such an unfriendly manner down inside the pyramid. He 
was dressed the same, in loose-fitting white trousers and shirt with a scarlet 
bandanna around his neck. And his expression was just as unfriendly. 
Angry, even. 

Sari and I both backed away from the mummy case, and Ahmed, his 
eyes darting from one of us to the other, took a step toward us. 

“Gabe, he’s coming after us!” Sari whispered. 

She grabbed my arm. Her hand was cold as ice. 



“Let’s get out of here!” she cried. 

I hesitated. Shouldn’t we stop and say hello to him first? 

But something about the stern, determined look on Ahmed’s face told 
me that Sari was right. 

We turned and began walking really fast away from him into the vast 
room, Sari a few steps ahead of me. 

I turned and saw that Ahmed was jogging after us. 

He shouted something to us, his voice angry, threatening. I couldn’t 
make out the words. 

“Run!” Sari cried. 

And now we were both running at full speed, our sneakers drumming 
loudly over the polished marble floor. 

We scooted around an enormous glass display case containing three 
upright mummy cases. Then we ran straight down the wide aisle between 
sculptures and shelves of ancient pottery and pyramid relics. 

Behind us, I could hear Ahmed shouting furiously, “Come back! Come 
back!” 

He sounded really angry. 

His shoes clacked against the floor as he ran, the sound echoing in the 
vast, empty museum chamber. 

“He’s gaining on us!” I called to Sari, who was still a few steps ahead. 

“There’s got to be a way out of here!” she answered breathlessly. 

But I immediately saw that there wasn’t. We were nearly to the back 
wall. We passed a gigantic sphinx, then stopped. 

There was nowhere to go. 

No doorway. No exit. 

A solid granite wall. 

We both turned and saw Ahmed’s eyes grow wide with triumph. 

He had us cornered. 



8 


Ahmed stopped a few feet in front of us. He was panting like a dog, gasping 
for air, and holding his side. He glared at us angrily. 

Sari glanced at me. She looked pale, really frightened. We both had 
our backs pressed against the wall. 

I swallowed hard. My throat felt tight and dry. 

What was he going to do to us? 

“Why did you run?” Ahmed finally managed to say, still holding his 
side as if he had a cramp. “Why?” 

We didn’t reply. We both stared back at him, waiting to see what he 
was about to do. 

“I came with a message from your father,” he told Sari, breathing hard. 
He raised the red bandanna from his neck and wiped his perspiring forehead 
with it. “Why did you run?” 

“A message?” Sari stammered. 

“Yes,” Ahmed said. “You know me. We met again yesterday. I don’t 
understand why you ran.” 

“I’m sorry,” Sari said quickly, glancing guiltily at me. 

“We weren’t thinking clearly,” I said. “Sari frightened me, and I 
followed her.” 

“Gabe was telling me all this frightening stuff,” she said, jabbing me 
hard in the side with her elbow. “It was his fault. He scared me with all this 
mummy stuff. So when I saw you, I wasn’t thinking clearly, and...” 

Both of us were babbling. We both felt so relieved that he wasn’t 
chasing us—and so embarrassed that we had run away from him. 

“Your father sent me to get you,” Ahmed said, his dark eyes trained on 
me. “I didn’t think I’d have to chase you through the whole museum.” 

“Sorry,” Sari and I said in unison. 

I felt like a complete jerk. I’m sure Sari did, too. 

“Daddy came back to the hotel and saw Gabe’s note?” Sari asked, 
straightening her hair with her hand as she moved away from the wall. 

“Yes.” Ahmed nodded. 

“He got back from the hospital awfully fast,” Sari said, glancing at her 



wrist watch. 

“Yes,” Ahmed replied again. “Come. I will take you back to the hotel. 
He is waiting for you there.” 

We followed him in silence, Sari and I walking side by side a few steps 
behind him. 

As we made our way down the long stairway, we glanced sheepishly at 
each other. We were both feeling really foolish for running away like that. 

A short while later, we were back on the crowded, noisy sidewalk, an 
unending stream of cars honking past, all moving in starts and stops, drivers 
hanging out of car windows, shouting and shaking their fists. 

Ahmed checked to make sure we were with him, then turned right and 
began leading the way through the crowd. The sun was high over the 
buildings now. The air was hot and humid. 

“Hey, wait—” I called. 

Ahmed turned back, but kept walking. 

“We’re going the wrong way,” I called to him, shouting over the cries 
of a street peddler behind a cart of vegetables. “The hotel is back that way.” 
I pointed. 

Ahmed shook his head. “My car is just up there.” 

“We’re driving back to the hotel?” Sari asked, her voice revealing her 
surprise. 

“It’s only two blocks,” I said to Ahmed. “Sari and I could walk back 
by ourselves if you want. You really don’t have to take us.” 

“It is no trouble,” Ahmed replied, and he placed his hands firmly, one 
on my shoulder, one on Sari’s, and continued to guide us to his car. 

We crossed the street and continued walking. The sidewalk grew even 
more crowded. A man swinging a leather briefcase accidentally clipped my 
shoulder with it. I cried out in pain. 

Sari laughed. 

“You have a great sense of humor,” I muttered sarcastically. 

“I know,” she replied. 

“If we’d walked, we would have been at the hotel already,” I said. 

Ahmed must have overheard, because he said, “The car’s in the next 
block.” 

We made our way quickly through the crowds. A short while later, 
Ahmed stopped at a small, four-door station wagon. It was covered with 



dust, and the fender on the driver’s side was crunched. 

He pulled open the back door, and Sari and I piled in. “Ow,” I 
complained. The leather seats were burning hot. 

“The wheel is hot, too,” Ahmed said, climbing in and fastening his 
seat belt. He touched the steering wheel a few times with both hands, trying 
to get used to the heat. “They should invent a car that stays cool inside 
when it is parked.” 

The engine started on the second try, and he pulled away from the curb 
and into the line of traffic. 

Immediately, he began honking the horn at the car in front of us. We 
moved slowly, stopping every few seconds, through the narrow street. 

“I wonder why Daddy didn’t come to get us,” Sari said to me, her eyes 
on the crowds passing by the dusty car window. 

“He said he would wait for you at the hotel,” Ahmed replied from the 
front seat. 

He made a sudden sharp turn onto a wider avenue and began to pick 
up speed. 

It took me a long while to realize that we were heading in the wrong 
direction —away from our hotel. “Uh... Ahmed... I think the hotel is back 
that way,” I said, pointing toward the back window. 

“I believe you are mistaken,” he replied softly, staring straight ahead 
through the windshield. “We will be there shortly.” 

“No. Really,” I insisted. 

One thing about me is I have a really good sense of direction. Mom 
and Dad always say they don’t need a map when I’m around. I almost 
always know when I’m heading the wrong way. 

Sari turned to glance at me, an expression of concern beginning to 
tighten her features. 

“Settle back and enjoy the ride,” Ahmed said, staring at me through 
the rearview mirror. “Have you fastened your seat belts? Better do it right 
now.” 

He had a smile on his face, but his voice was cold. His words sounded 
like a threat. 

“Ahmed, we’ve gone too far,” I insisted, starting to feel really afraid. 

Outside the window, the buildings were lower, more rundown. We 
seemed to be heading away from the downtown area. 



“Just settle back,” he replied with growing impatience. “I know where 
I’m going.” 

Sari and I exchanged glances. She looked as worried as I did. We both 
realized that Ahmed was lying to us. He wasn’t taking us to the hotel. He 
was taking us out of town. 

We were being kidnapped.

Seeing Ahmed’s eyes on me in the rearview mirror, I fiddled with the seat 
belt, pretending to fasten it. As I did this, I leaned close to Sari and 
whispered in her ear, “Next time he stops.” 

At first she didn’t get my meaning. But then I saw that she understood. 

We both sat tensely, eyes on the door handles, waiting in silence. 

“Your father is a very smart man,” Ahmed said, staring at Sari in the 
mirror. 

“I know,” Sari replied in a tiny voice. 

The traffic slowed, then stopped. 

“Now!” I screamed. 

We both grabbed for the door handles. 

I pushed my door open and flung myself out of the car. 

Horns were honking in front of me and behind me. I could hear 
Ahmed’s surprised shout. 

Leaving the car door open, I turned to see that Sari had made it to the 
street, too. She turned to me as she slammed her door shut, her eyes wide 
with fear. 

Without a word, we started to run. 

The car horns seemed to grow louder as we headed into a narrow side 
street. We were running side by side, following the narrow brick street as it 
curved between two rows of tall, white stucco buildings. 

I feel like a rat in a maze, I thought. 

The street grew even narrower. Then it emptied into a wide circle 
filled with a small market of fruit and vegetable stands. 

“Is he following us?” Sari cried, a few steps behind me now. 

I turned back and searched for him, my eyes darting through the small 
crowd attending the market. 

I saw several people in flowing white robes. Two women entered the 
market, dressed in black, carrying a basket loaded high with bananas. A boy 
on a bicycle swerved to keep from running straight into them. 

“I don’t see him,” I called back to Sari. 

But we kept running just to make sure. 



I’d never been so scared in my life. 

Please, please, I begged silently, don’t let him be following us. Don’t 
let him catch us! 

Turning a corner, we found ourselves on a wide, busy avenue. A tmck 
bounced past, pulling a trailer filled with horses. The sidewalk was crowded 
with shoppers and businesspeople. 

Sari and I pushed our way through them, trying to lose ourselves in the 
crowd. 

Finally, we came to a stop near the entrance of what appeared to be a 
large department store. Breathing hard, I rested my hands on my knees, 
leaned forward, and tried to catch my breath. 

“We’ve lost him,” Sari said, staring back in the direction from which 
we’d come. 

“Yeah. We’re okay,” I said happily. I smiled at her, but she didn’t 
return the smile. 

Her face was filled with fear. Her eyes continued to stare into the 
crowd. One hand tugged nervously at a strand of her hair. 

“We’re okay,” I repeated. “We got away.” 

“There’s only one problem,” she said quietly, her eyes still on the 
crowd bustling toward us on the sidewalk. 

“Huh? Problem?” 

“Now we’re lost,” she replied, finally turning to face me. “We’re lost, 
Gabe. We don’t know where we are.” 

I suddenly had a heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach. I started to 
utter a frightened cry. 

But I forced myself to hold it in. 

I forced myself to pretend I wasn’t afraid. 

Sari had always been the brave one, the winner, the champ. And I was 
always the wimp. But now I could see that she was really scared. This was 
my chance to be the cool one, my chance to show her who was really the 
champ. 

“No problem,” I told her, gazing up at the tall glass and concrete 
buildings. “We’ll just ask somebody to direct us to the hotel.” 

“But no one speaks English!” she cried, sounding as if she were about 
to cry. 

“Uh... no problem,” I said, a little less cheerily. “I’m sure someone...” 



“We’re lost,” she repeated miserably, shaking her head. “Totally lost.” 

And then I saw the answer to our problem parked at the curb. It was a 
taxi, an empty taxi. 

“Come on,” I said, tugging her arm. I pulled her to the taxi. The driver, 
a thin, young man with a wide black mustache and stringy black hair falling 
out of a small gray cap, turned around in surprise as Sari and I climbed into 
the back seat. 

“The Cairo Center Hotel,” I said, glancing reassuringly at Sari. 

The driver stared back at me blankly, as if he didn’t understand. 

“Please take us to the Cairo Center Hotel,” I repeated slowly and 
clearly. 

And then he tossed back his head, opened his mouth, and started to 
laugh. 



10 


The driver laughed till tears formed in the comers of his eyes. 

Sari grabbed my arm. “He’s working for Ahmed,” she whispered, 
squeezing my wrist. “We’ve walked right into a trap!” 

“Huh?” I felt a stab of fear in my chest. 

I didn’t think she was right. 

She couldn’t be right! 

But I didn’t know what else to think. 

I grabbed the door handle and started to leap out of the taxi. But the 
driver raised a hand, signaling for me to stop. 

“Gabe— go\” Sari pushed me hard from behind. 

“Cairo Center Hotel?” the driver asked suddenly, wiping the tears from 
his eyes with a finger. Then he pointed through the windshield. “Cairo 
Center Hotel?” 

Sari and I both followed his finger. 

There was the hotel. Right across the street. 

He started to laugh again, shaking his head. 

“Thanks,” I shouted, and climbed out. 

Sari scrambled out behind me, a wide, relieved smile on her face. “I 
don’t think it’s that funny,” I told her. “The cab driver has a strange sense of 
humor.” 

I turned back. The driver was still staring at us, a broad smile on his 

face. 

“Come on,” she urged, tugging at my arm. “We have to tell Daddy 
about Ahmed.” 

But to our surprise, our hotel room was empty. My note was still on 
the table where I had left it. Nothing had been moved or touched. 

“He hasn’t been back here,” Sari said, picking up my note and 
crumpling it into a ball in her hand. “Ahmed lied—about everything.” 

I flopped down on the couch with a loud sigh. “I wonder what’s going 
on,” I said unhappily. “I just don’t get it.” 

Sari and I both screamed as the door to the room flew open. 



“Daddy!” Sari cried, running to hug him. 

I was sure glad it was Uncle Ben, and not Ahmed. 

“Daddy, the strangest thing—” Sari started. 

Uncle Ben had his arm around her shoulder. As he led her across the 
room toward the couch, I could see that he had a really dazed expression on 
his face. 

“Yes, it’s strange,” he muttered, shaking his head. “Both of my 
workers...” 

“Huh? Are they okay?” Sari asked. 

“No. Not really,” Uncle Ben replied, dropping onto the arm of the 
armchair, staring hard but not really focusing on me. “They’re both... in a 
state of shock. I guess that’s how to describe it.” 

“They were in an accident? In the pyramid?” I asked. 

Uncle Ben scratched the bald spot at the back of his head. “I don’t 
really know. They can’t talk. They’re both... speechless. I think something 
—or someone—frightened them. Scared them speechless. The doctors are 
completely confused. They said that—” 

“Daddy, Ahmed tried to kidnap us!” Sari interrupted, squeezing his 
hand. 

“What? Ahmed?” He narrowed his eyes, his forehead wrinkling up in 
confusion. “What do you mean?” 

“Ahmed. The guy at the pyramid. The one who wears the white suits 
with the red bandanna and always carries the clipboard,” Sari explained. 

“He told us you sent him to get us,” I said. “He came to the museum 

“Museum?” Uncle Ben climbed to his feet. “What were you doing at 
the museum? I thought I told you—” 

“We had to get out of here,” Sari said, putting a hand on her dad’s 
shoulder, trying to calm him. “Gabe wanted to see mummies, so we went to 
the museum. But Ahmed came and took us to his car. He said he was taking 
us to you at the hotel.” 

“But he was driving the wrong way,” I continued the story. “So we 
jumped out and ran away.” 

“Ahmed?” Uncle Ben kept repeating the name, as if he just couldn’t 
believe it. “He came to me with excellent credentials and references,” he 
said. “He’s a cryptographer. He studies ancient Egyptian. He’s mainly 



interested in the wall writings and symbols we uncover.” 

“So why did he come for us?” I asked. 

“Where was he going to take us?” Sari asked. 

“I don’t know,” Uncle Ben said. “But I certainly intend to find out.” 
He hugged Sari. “What a mystery,” he continued. “You’re both okay?” 

“Yeah. We’re okay,” I replied. 

“I’ve got to get to the pyramid,” he said, letting go of Sari and walking 
to the window. “I gave my workers the day off. But I’ve got to get to the 
bottom of this.” 

Clouds rolled over the sun. The room suddenly grew darker. 

“I’ll order up some room service for you,” Uncle Ben said, a 
thoughtful expression on his face. “Will you two be okay here till I get back 
tonight?” 

“No!” Sari cried. “You can’t leave us here!” 

“Why can’t we come with you?” I asked. 

“Yes! We’re coming with you!” Sari exclaimed, before Uncle Ben had 
a chance to reply. 

He shook his head. “Too dangerous,” he said, his eyes narrowing as he 
glanced first at me, then at Sari. “Until I can find out what happened to my 
two workers in there—” 

“But, Daddy, what if Ahmed comes back?” Sari cried, sounding really 
frightened. “What if he comes here?” 

Uncle Ben scowled. “Ahmed,” he muttered. “Ahmed.” 

“You can’t leave us here!” Sari repeated. 

Uncle Ben stared out the window at the darkening sky. “I guess you’re 
right,” he said finally. “I guess I have to take you with me.” 

“Yes!” Sari and I both cried, relieved. 

“But you have to promise to stick close,” Uncle Ben said sternly, 
pointing a finger at Sari. “I mean it. No wandering off. No more practical 
jokes.” 

I realized I was seeing a whole new side of my uncle. Even though he 
was a well-known scientist, he had always been the jolly practical joker of 
the family. 

But now he was worried. 

Seriously worried. 

No more jokes until the frightening mystery was cleared up. 



We had sandwiches downstairs in the hotel restaurant, then drove 
through the desert to the pyramid. 

Heavy clouds rolled across the sun as we drove, casting shadows over 
the sand, coloring the desert darkly in shimmering shades of blue and gray. 

Before long, the enormous pyramid loomed on the horizon, appearing 
to grow larger as we approached on the nearly empty highway. 

I remembered the first time I had seen it, just a few days before. Such 
an amazing sight. 

But now, watching it through the car windshield, I felt only dread. 

Uncle Ben parked the car near the low entrance he had discovered 
behind the pyramid. As we stepped out, the wind whipped at the ground, 
tossing the sand up, whirling it around our legs. 

Uncle Ben raised a hand to stop us at the tunnel entrance. 

“Here,” he said. He reached into his supply pack and pulled out 
equipment for Sari and me. “Clip this on.” 

He handed each of us a beeper. “Just push the button, and it will beep 
me,” he said, helping me clip mine to the belt on my jeans. “It’s like a 
homing device. If you push the button, it sends electronic signals to the unit 
I’m wearing. Then I can track you down by following the sound levels. Of 
course, I don’t expect you to use it because I expect you to stay close to 
me.” 

He handed us flashlights. “Watch your step,” he instructed. “Keep the 
light down at your feet, a few yards ahead of you on the floor.” 

“We know, Daddy,” Sari said. “We’ve done this before, remember?” 

“Just follow instructions,” he said sharply, and turned into the darkness 
of the pyramid opening. 

I stopped at the entrance and pulled out my little mummy hand, just to 
make sure I had it. 

“What are you doing with that?” Sari asked, making a face. 

“My good luck charm,” I said, slipping it back into my pocket. 

She groaned and gave me a playful shove into the pyramid entrance. 

A few minutes later, we were once again making our way carefully 
down the long rope ladder and into the first narrow tunnel. 

Uncle Ben led the way, the wide circle of light from his flashlight 
sweeping back and forth across the tunnel ahead of him. Sari was a few 
steps behind him, and I walked a few steps behind her. 



The tunnel seemed narrower and lower this time. I guess it was just my 
mood. 

Gripping the flashlight tightly, keeping the light aimed down, I dipped 
my head to keep from hitting the low, curved ceiling. 

The tunnel bent to the left, then sloped downhill where it split into two 
paths. We followed the one to the right. The only sound was that of our 
shoes scraping against the sandy, dry floor. 

Uncle Ben coughed. 

Sari said something. I couldn’t hear what it was. 

I had stopped to shine my light on a bunch of spiders on the ceiling, 
and the two of them had walked several yards ahead of me. 

Following my light as it moved over the floor, I saw that my sneaker 
had come untied once again. 

“Oh, man—not again!” 

I stooped to tie it, setting the flashlight on the ground beside me. “Hey 
—wait up!” I called. 

But they had started to argue about something, and I don’t think they 
heard me. I could hear their voices echoing loudly down the long, twisting 
tunnel, but I couldn’t make out their words. 

I hurriedly double-knotted the shoe lace, grabbed up the flashlight, and 
climbed to my feet. “Hey, wait up!” I shouted anxiously. 

Where had they gone? 

I realized that I couldn’t hear their voices anymore. 

This can’t be happening to me again! I thought. 

“Hey!” I shouted, cupping my hands over my mouth. My voice echoed 
down the tunnel. 

But no voices called back. 

“Wait up!” 

Typical, I thought. 

They were so involved in their argument, they forgot all about me. 

I realized that I was more angry than frightened. Uncle Ben had made 
such a big deal about us sticking close together. And then he walked off and 
left me alone in the tunnel. 

“Hey, where are you?” I shouted. 

No reply. 



11 


Beaming the light ahead of me on the floor, I ducked my head and began 
jogging, following the tunnel as it curved sharply to the right. 

The floor began to slope upwards. The air became hot and musty 
smelling. I found myself gasping for breath. 

“Uncle Ben!” I called. “Sari!” 

They must be around the next curve in the tunnel, I told myself. It 
hadn’t taken me that long to tie my shoelace. They couldn’t have gotten that 
far ahead. 

Hearing a sound, I stopped. 

And listened. 

Silence now. 

Was I starting to hear things? 

I had a sudden flash: Was this another mean practical joke? Were Sari 
and Uncle Ben hiding, waiting to see what I’d do? 

Was this another lame trick of theirs to frighten me? 

It could be. Uncle Ben, I knew, could never resist a practical joke. He 
had laughed like a hyena when Sari told him how she’d hid in the mummy 
case and scared about ten years off my life. 

Were they both hiding in mummy cases now, just waiting for me to 
stumble by? 

My heart thumped in my chest. Despite the heat of the ancient tunnel, I 
felt cold all over. 

No, I decided. This isn’t a practical joke. 

Uncle Ben was too serious today, too worried about his stricken 
workers. Too worried about what we’d told him about Ahmed. He wasn’t in 
any mood for practical jokes. 

I began making my way through the tunnel again. As I jogged, my 
hand brushed against the beeper at my waist. 

Should I push it? 

No, I decided. 

That would only give Sari a good laugh. She’d be eager to tell 
everyone how I’d started beeping for help after being in the pyramid for 



two minutes! 

I turned the corner. The tunnel walls seemed to close in on me as the 
tunnel narrowed. 

“Sari? Uncle Ben?” 

No echo. Maybe the tunnel was too narrow for an echo. 

The floor grew harder, less sandy. In the dim yellow light, I could see 
that the granite walls were lined with jagged cracks. They looked like dark 
lightning bolts coming down from the ceiling. 

“Hey—where are you guys?” I shouted. 

I stopped when the tunnel branched in two directions. 

I suddenly realized how scared I was. 

Where had they disappeared to? They had to have realized by now that 
I wasn’t with them. 

I stared at the two openings, shining my light first into one tunnel, then 
the other. 

Which one had they entered? 

Which one? 

My heart pounding, I ran into the tunnel on the left and shouted their 
names. 

No reply. 

I backed out quickly, my light darting wildly over the floor, and 
stepped into the tunnel to the right. 

This tunnel was wider and higher. It curved gently to the right. 

A maze of tunnels. That’s how Uncle Ben had described the pyramid. 
Maybe thousands of tunnels, he had told me. 

Thousands. 

Keep moving, I urged myself. 

Keep moving, Gabe. 

They’re right up ahead. They’ve got to be! 

I took a few steps and then called out to them. 

I heard something. 

Voices? 

I stopped. It was so quiet now. So quiet, I could hear my heart 
pounding in my chest. 

The sound again. 

I listened hard, holding my breath. 



It was a chattering sound. A soft cluttering. Not a human voice. An 
insect, maybe. Or a rat. 

“Uncle Ben? Sari?” 

Silence. 

I took a few more steps into the tunnel. Then a few more. 

I decided Td better forget my pride and beep them. 

So what if Sari teased me about it? 

I was too frightened to care. 

If I beeped them, they’d be right there to get me in a few seconds. 

But as I reached to my waist for the beeper, I was startled by a loud 
noise. 

The insect chittering became a soft cracking sound. 

I stopped to listen, the fear rising up to my throat. 

The soft cracking grew louder. 

It sounded like someone breaking saltines in two. 

Only louder. Louder. 

Louder. 

Right under my feet. 

I turned my eyes to the floor. 

I shined the light at my shoes. 

It took me so long to realize what was happening. 

The ancient tunnel floor was cracking apart beneath me. 

The cracking grew louder, seemed to come from all directions, to 
surround me. 

By the time I realized what was happening, it was too late. 

I felt as if I were being pulled down, sucked down by a powerful force. 
The floor crumbled away beneath me, and I was falling. 

Falling down, down, down an endless black hole. 

I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. 

My hands flew up and grabbed—nothing! 

I closed my eyes and fell. 

Down, down into the swirling blackness.

I heard the flashlight clang against the floor. 

Then I hit. Hard. 

I landed on my side. Pain shot through my body, and I saw red. A flash 
of bright red that grew brighter and brighter until I had to close my eyes. I 
think the force of the blow knocked me out for a short while. 

When I opened my eyes, everything was a gray-yellow blur. My side 
ached. My right elbow throbbed with pain. 

I tried the elbow. It seemed to move okay. 

I sat up. The haze slowly began to lift, like a curtain slowly rising. 

Where was I? 

A sour smell invaded my nostrils. The smell of decay. Of ancient dust. 
Of death. 

The flashlight had landed beside me on the concrete floor. I followed 
its beam of light toward the wall. 

And gasped. 

The light stopped on a hand. 

A human hand. 

Or was it? 

The hand was attached to an arm. The arm hung stiffly from an erect 
body. 

My hand trembling, I grabbed up the flashlight and tried to steady the 
light on the figure. 

It was a mummy, I realized. Standing on its feet near the far wall. 

Eyeless, mouthless, the bandaged face seemed to stare back at me, 
tense and ready, as if waiting for me to make the first move. 



13 


A mummy? 

The light darted over its featureless face. I couldn’t steady my hand. 
My whole body was shaking. 

Frozen in place, not able to move off the hard floor, I gaped at the 
frightening figure. I suddenly realized I was panting loudly. 

Trying to calm myself, I sucked in a deep breath of the putrid air, and 
held it. 

The mummy stared blindly back at me. 

It stood stiffly, its arms hanging at its sides. 

Why is it standing there like that? I wondered, taking another deep 
breath. 

The ancient Egyptians didn’t leave their mummies standing at 
attention. 

Realizing that it wasn’t moving forward to attack me, I began to feel a 
little calmer. 

“Easy, Gabe. Easy,” I said aloud, trying to steady the flashlight I 
gripped so tightly in my hand. 

I coughed. The air was so foul. So old. 

Groaning from the pain in my side, I climbed to my feet and began 
rapidly shining the light back and forth beyond the silent, faceless mummy. 

I was in an enormous, high-ceilinged chamber. Much bigger than the 
chamber Uncle Ben’s workers had been digging in. 

And much more cluttered. 

“Wow.” I uttered a low cry as the pale light of the flashlight revealed 
an amazing scene. Dark, bandaged figures hovered all around me. 

The vast chamber was crammed with mummies! 

In the unsteady light, their shadows seemed to reach toward me. 

Shuddering, I took a step back. I moved the light slowly over the 
strange, hideous scene. 

The light burned through the shadows, revealing bandaged arms, 
torsos, legs, covered faces. 

There were so many of them. 



There were mummies leaning against the wall. Mummies lying on 
stone slabs, arms crossed over their chests. Mummies leaning at odd angles, 
crouched low or standing tall, their arms straight out in front of them like 
Frankenstein monsters. 

Against one wall stood a row of mummy cases, their lids propped 
open. I turned, following the arc of my light. I realized that my fall had 
dropped me into the center of the room. 

Behind me, I could make out an amazing array of equipment. Strange, 
pronglike tools I had never seen before. Tall stacks of cloth. Gigantic clay 
pots and jars. 

Easy, Gabe. Easy. 

Whoa. Breathe slowly. 

I took a few reluctant steps closer, trying to hold the flashlight steady. 

A few more steps. 

I walked up to one of the tall stacks of cloth. Linen, most likely. The 
material used for making mummies. 

Gathering my courage, I examined some of the tools. Not touching 
anything. Just staring at them in the wavering light of the flashlight. 

Mummy-making tools. Ancient mummy-making tools. 

I stepped away. Turned back toward the crowd of unmoving figures. 

My light traveled across the room and came to rest on a dark square 
area on the floor. Curious, I moved closer, stepping around twin mummies, 
lying on their backs, their arms crossed over their chests. 

Whoa. Easy, Gabe. 

My sneakers scraped noisily along the floor as I made my way 
hesitantly across the vast chamber. 

The dark square on the floor was nearly the size of a swimming pool. I 
bent down at its edge to examine it more closely. 

The surface was soft and sticky. Like tar. 

Was this an ancient tar pit? Was this tar used in the making of the 
mummies that hovered so menacingly around the room? 

I had a sudden chill that froze me to the spot. 

How could this tar pit be soft after four thousand years ? 

Why was everything in this chamber—the tools, the mummies, the 
linen—preserved so well? 

And why were these mummies—at least two dozen of them—left out 



like this, scattered about the room in such strange positions? 

I realized that I had made an incredible discovery here. By falling 
through the floor, I had found a hidden chamber, a chamber where 
mummies had been made. I had found all of the tools and all of the 
materials used to make mummies four thousand years ago. 

Once again, the sour smell invaded my nose. I held my breath to keep 
myself from gagging. It was the smell of four-thousand-year-old bodies, I 
realized. A smell that had been bottled up in this ancient, hidden chamber— 
until now. 

Staring at the twisted, shadowy figures gazing back at me in faceless 
horror, I reached for the beeper. 

Uncle Ben, you must come quickly, I thought. 

I don’t want to be alone down here any longer. 

You must come here now! 

I pulled the beeper off my belt and brought it up close to the light. 

All I had to do, I realized, was push the button, and Uncle Ben and 
Sari would come running. 

Gripping the small square tightly in my hand, I moved my hand to the 
button—and cried out in alarm. 

The beeper was ruined. Wrecked. Smashed. 

The button wouldn’t even push. 

I must have landed on it when I fell. 

It was useless. 

I was all alone down here. 

Alone with the ancient mummies, staring facelessly, silently, at me 
through the deep, dark shadows. 



14 


All alone. 

I stared in horror at the worthless beeper. 

The flashlight trembled in my hand. 

Suddenly, everything seemed to move in on me. The walls. The 
ceiling. The darkness. 

The mummies. 

“Huh?” 

I stumbled back a step. Then another. 

I realized I was gripping the flashlight so tightly, my hand hurt. 

The light played over the faceless figures. 

They weren’t moving. 

Of course they weren’t moving. 

I took another step back. The sour odor seemed to grow stronger, 
thicker. I held my breath, but the smell was in my nostrils, in my mouth. I 
could taste it, taste the decay, taste the four-thousand-year-old aroma of 
death. 

I tossed the worthless beeper on the floor and took another step back, 
keeping my eyes on the hovering mummies. 

What was I going to do? 

The smell was making me sick. I had to get out of there, had to call 
Uncle Ben. 

Another step back. 

“Help!” 

I tried to shout, but my voice sounded weak, muffled by the heavy, 
foul air. 

“Help! Can anybody hear me?” A little louder. 

Tucking the flashlight under my arm, I cupped my hands around my 
mouth to form a megaphone. “Can anybody hear me?” I screamed. 

I listened, desperate for a reply. 

Silence. 

Where were Sari and Uncle Ben? Why couldn’t they hear me? Why 



weren’t they looking for me? 

“Help! Somebody—please help!” 

I screamed as loud as I could, tilting my head up to the hole in the 
ceiling, the hole I had fallen through. 

“Can’t anybody hear me?” I shrieked. 

I could feel the panic grip my chest, freeze my legs. 

The panic swept over me, wave after paralyzing wave. 

“Help me! Somebody —please!” 

I took another step back. 

And something crunched under my sneaker. 

I uttered a high-pitched yelp and stumbled forward. 

Whatever it was slithered away. 

I exhaled loudly, a long sigh of relief. 

And then I felt something brush against my ankle. 

I cried out, and the flashlight dropped from under my arm. It clattered 
noisily to the floor. 

The light went out. 

Again, something scraped silently against me. 

Something hard. 

I heard soft, scrabbling sounds down on the floor. Something snapped 
at my ankle. 

I kicked hard, but hit only air. 

“Ohh, help!” 

There were creatures down there. A lot of them. 

But what were they? 

Again, something slapped at my ankle, and I kicked wildly. 

Frantically, I bent down, grabbing for the flashlight in the darkness. 
And touched something hard and warm. 

“Ohh, no!” 

I jerked my hand up with a startled cry. 

In the darkness, groping for the flashlight, I had the feeling that the 
entire floor had come to life. The floor was moving in waves, rolling and 
tossing, seething beneath me. 

Finally, I found the flashlight. I grabbed it up in my trembling hand, 
climbed to my feet, and struggled to turn it back on. 



As I stepped backward, something slid against my leg. 

It felt hard. And prickly. 

I heard clicking sounds. Snapping. Creatures bumping into each other. 

Panting loudly, my chest heaving, my entire body gripped with terror, I 
jumped up, tried to dance away as I fiddled with the flashlight. 

Something crunched loudly beneath my sneaker. I danced away, 
hopping over something that scuttled through my legs. 

Finally, the light flickered on. 

My heart thudding, I lowered the yellow beam of light to the floor. 

And saw the scrabbling, snapping creatures. 

Scorpions! 

I had stumbled into a disgusting nest of them. 

“Ohh—help!” 

I didn’t recognize my tiny, frightened voice as I cried out. I didn’t even 
realize I had cried out. 

The light darted over the slithering creatures, their tails raised as if 
ready to attack, their claws snapping silently as they moved. Crawling over 
each other. Slithering past my ankles. 

“ S omebody—help! ” 

I leapt backwards as a pair of claws grabbed at the leg of my jeans— 
into another of the creatures whose tail snapped against the back of my 
sneaker. 

Struggling to escape from the poisonous creatures, I tripped. 

“No! Please —no/” 

I couldn’t save myself. 

I started to fall. 

My hands shot out, but there was nothing to grab on to. 

I was going to plunge right into the middle of them. 

“Nooooo!” 

I uttered a frantic cry as I toppled forward. 

And felt two hands grab me by the shoulders from behind. 



15 


A mummy! I thought. 

My entire body convulsed with fear. 

The scorpions snapped and scrabbled at my feet. 

The strong hands gripped my shoulders, pulled me hard. 

The ancient, bandaged hands. 

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. 

Finally, I managed to spin around. 

“Sari!” I cried. 

She gave me one more tug. We both stumbled backwards, claws 
snapping up at us. 

“Sari—how—?” 

We moved together now, making our way toward the center of the vast 
chamber. 

Safe. Safe from the disgusting nest of snapping scorpions. 

“Saved your life,” she whispered. “Yuck. Those are gross!” 

“Tell me about it,” I said weakly. I could still feel the hideous creatures 
sliding along my ankles, still feel them slithering between my legs, 
crunching under my sneakers. 

I don’t think I’ll ever forget that crunching sound. 

“What are you doing down here?” Sari cried impatiently, as if scolding 
a child. “Daddy and I have been looking everywhere for you.” 

I pulled her even farther from the scorpions, into the center of the 
chamber. “How did you get down here?” I cried, struggling to calm my 
breathing, struggling to stop the pounding in my chest. 

She pointed with her flashlight to a tunnel in the corner that I hadn’t 
seen. “I was searching for you. Daddy and I got separated. Do you believe 
it? He stopped to talk to a worker, and I didn’t realize it. By the time I 
turned back, he was gone. Then I saw the light moving around in here. I 
thought it was Daddy.” 

“You got lost, too?” I asked, wiping beads of cold sweat off my 
forehead with the back of my hand. 

“I’m not lost. You’re lost,” she insisted. “How could you do that, 



Gabe? Daddy and I were totally freaked.” 

“Why didn’t you wait up for me?” I demanded angrily. “I called to 
you. You just disappeared.” 

“We didn’t hear you,” she replied, shaking her head. I was really glad 
to see her. But I hated the way she was looking at me, like I was some kind 
of hopeless idiot. “I guess we got involved in our argument. We thought 
you were right behind us. Then when we turned around, you were gone.” 
She sighed and shook her head. “What a day!” 

“What a day?” I cried shrilly. “What a day?” 

“Gabe, why did you do that?” she demanded. “You know we were 
supposed to stay close together.” 

“Hey—it wasn’t my fault,” I insisted angrily. 

“Daddy is so mad,” Sari said, shining her light in my face. 

I raised my arm to shield my eyes. “Cut it out,” I snapped. “He won’t 
be mad when he sees what I’ve discovered. Look.” 

I shined my light onto a mummy crouching near the tar pit, then 
moved it to another mummy, this one lying down, then to the row of 
mummy cases against the wall. 

“Wow.” Sari mouthed the word silently. Her eyes grew wide with 
surprise. 

“Yeah. Wow,” I said, starting to feel a little more like normal. “The 
chamber is filled with mummies. And there are all kinds of tools and cloth 
and everything you need to make a mummy. It’s all in perfect shape, like it 
hasn’t been touched in thousands of years.” I couldn’t hide my excitement. 
“And I discovered it all,” I added. 

“This must be where they prepared the mummies for burial,” Sari said, 
her eyes darting from mummy to mummy. “But why are some of them 
standing up like that?” 

I shrugged. “Beats me.” 

She walked over to admire the stacks of neatly folded linen. “Wow. 
This is amazing, Gabe.” 

“Outstanding!” I agreed. “And if I hadn’t stopped to tie my sneaker, I 
never would have discovered it.” 

“You’re going to be famous,” Sari said, a smile spreading across her 
face. “Thanks to me saving your life.” 

“Sari—” I started. 



But she had moved across the room and was admiring one of the 
upright mummies close up. “Wait till Daddy sees all this,” she said, 
suddenly sounding as excited as me. 

“We have to call him,” I said eagerly. I glanced back at the scorpion 
nest and felt a chill of fear tighten the back of my neck. 

“People were so tiny back then,” she said, holding her flashlight up 
close to the mummy’s covered face. “Look—I’m taller than this one.” 

“Sari, use your beeper,” I said impatiently, walking over to her. 

“Yuck. There are bugs crawling in this one’s face,” she said, stepping 
back and lowering the light. She made a disgusted face. “Gross.” 

“Come on. Use your beeper. Call Uncle Ben,” I said. I reached for the 
beeper at her waist, but she pulled away. 

“Okay, okay. Why didn’t you use yours?” She eyed me suspiciously. 
“You forgot about it, didn’t you, Gabe?” she accused. 

“No way,” I replied sharply. “Mine broke when I fell into this place.” 

She made a face and pulled the beeper off her belt loop. I shined my 
light on it as she pushed the button. She pressed it twice, just to make sure, 
then clipped it back onto her jeans. 

We stood with our arms crossed, waiting for Uncle Ben to follow the 
radio signals and find us. 

“It shouldn’t take him long,” Sari said, her eyes on the tunnel in the 
corner. “He wasn’t far behind me.” 

Sure enough, a few seconds later, we heard the sounds of someone 
approaching in the tunnel. 

“Uncle Ben!” I called excitedly. “Look what I’ve found!” 

Sari and I both started to run to the tunnel, our lights zigzagging over 
the low entrance. 

“Daddy, you won’t believe—” Sari started. 

She stopped when the stooped figure leaned out of the darkness and 
straightened up. 

We both gaped in horror, our flashlights making his mustached face 
glow eerily. 

“It’s Ahmed!” Sari cried, grabbing my arm. 



16 


I swallowed hard. 

Sari and I stared at each other. I saw her features tighten in fear. 

Ahmed. 

He had tried to kidnap us. And now he had us all alone down here. 

He stepped forward, a flaming torch held high in one hand. His black 
hair glowed in the flickering flames. His eyes narrowed at us in menace. 

“Ahmed, what are you doing here?” Sari called, grasping my arm so 
hard, I winced. 

“What are you doing here?” he asked softly, his voice as cold as his 

eyes. 

Holding the torch in front of him, he stepped into the chamber. His 
eyes went around the room, as if inspecting it, making sure that nothing had 
been moved. 

“My dad will be here in a second,” Sari warned him. “I just beeped 
him.” 

“I tried to warn your father,” Ahmed said, staring hard at Sari. The 
flickering orange light from the torch made him grow bright, then fade into 
shadow. 

“Warn him?” Sari asked. 

“About the curse,” Ahmed said without emotion. 

“Uncle Ben mentioned some kind of curse to me,” I said, glancing 
nervously at Sari. “I don’t think he takes that kind of thing seriously.” 

“He should!” Ahmed replied, screaming the words, his eyes glowing 
with anger in the torch light. 

Sari and I stared back at him in silence. 

Where is Uncle Ben? I wondered. 

What’s keeping him? 

Hurry, I urged silently. Please — hurry! 

“The curse must be carried out,” Ahmed said softly again, almost 
sadly. “I have no choice. You have violated the priestess’ chamber.” 

“Priestess?” I stammered. 



Sari was still squeezing my arm. I tugged it away. She crossed her 
arms resolutely over her chest. 

“This chamber belongs to the Priestess Khala,” Ahmed said, lowering 
the torch. “This is the sacred Preparation Chamber of the Priestess Khala, 
and you have violated it.” 

“Well, we didn’t know,” Sari snapped. “I really don’t see what’s the 
big deal, Ahmed.” 

“She’s right,” I said quickly. “We didn’t touch anything. We didn’t 
move anything. I don’t think—” 

“Shut up, you fools!” Ahmed screamed. He swung the torch angrily as 
if trying to hit us. 

“Ahmed, my dad will be here any second,” Sari repeated, her voice 
trembling. 

We both turned our eyes to the tunnel. It was dark and silent. 

No sign of Uncle Ben. 

“Your father is a smart man,” Ahmed said. “It is too bad he wasn’t 
smart enough to heed my warnings.” 

“Warnings?” Sari asked. 

I realized she was stalling for time, trying to keep Ahmed talking until 
Uncle Ben arrived. 

“I frightened the two workers,” Ahmed confessed to Sari. “I frightened 
them to show your father that the curse was alive, that I was prepared to 
carry out Khala’s wishes.” 

“How did you frighten them?” Sari demanded. 

He smiled. “I gave them a little demonstration. I showed them what it 
might feel like to be boiled alive.” He turned his eyes to the tar pit. “They 
didn’t like it,” he added quietly. 

“But, Ahmed—” Sari started. 

He cut her off. “Your father should have known better than to return 
here. He should have believed me. He should have believed in the Priestess’ 
curse. The Priestess cursed all who would violate her chamber.” 

“But, come on, you don’t really believe—” I started. 

He raised the torch menacingly. “It was decreed by Khala more than 
four thousand years ago that this sacred chamber would not be violated,” he 
cried, gesturing with the torch, leaving a trail of orange light against the 
darkness. “Since that time, from generation to generation, descendants of 



Khala have made sure that the Priestess’ command was obeyed.” 

“But, Ahmed—” Sari cried. 

“It has come to me,” he continued, ignoring her, ignoring us both, 
staring at the ceiling as he spoke, as if speaking directly to the Priestess up 
in the heavens. “It has come to me as a descendant of Khala to make sure 
the curse is carried out.” 

I stared past Ahmed to the tunnel. Still no sign of Uncle Ben. 

Was he coming? Had Sari’s beeper worked? 

What was keeping him? 

“I volunteered to work for your father to make sure that Khala’s sacred 
sanctuary was not violated,” Ahmed continued, shadows flickering over his 
menacing face. “When he would not heed my warnings, I had to take 
action. I frightened the two workers. Then I planned to take you away, to 
hide you until he agreed to stop his work.” 

He lowered the torch. His face filled with sadness. “Now, I have no 
choice. I must carry out my sacred duties. I must keep the ancient promise 
to Khala.” 

“But what does that mean?” Sari cried. The orange torchlight revealed 
her frightened expression. 

“What does it mean?” Ahmed repeated. He gestured with the torch. 
“Look around you.” 

We both turned and glanced quickly around the chamber. But we 
didn’t understand. 

“The mummies,” he explained. 

We still didn’t understand. “What about the mummies?” I managed to 
stammer. 

“They were all violators of the Priestess’ chamber,” Ahmed revealed. 
The thin smile that formed on his face could only be described as a proud 
smile. 

“You mean—they’re not from ancient Egypt?” Sari cried, raising her 
hands in horror to her face. 

“A few of them,” Ahmed replied, still smiling that frightening, cold 
smile. “A few of them were ancient intruders. Some are quite recent. But 
they all have one thing in common. They all became victims of the curse. 
And they all were mummified a/zve!” 

“No!” I screamed without realizing it. 



Ahmed ignored my terrified outburst. “I did that one myself,” he said, 
pointing to a mummy standing stiffly at attention at the edge of the tar pit. 

“Oh, how awful!” Sari cried, her voice trembling. 

I stared hopefully at the tunnel opening behind Ahmed. But there was 
still no sign of Uncle Ben. 

“Today, I must go to work again,” Ahmed announced. “Today there 
will be new mummies. New trophies for Khala.” 

“You can’t do that!” Sari shrieked. 

I grabbed her hand. 

To my horror, I understood perfectly now. I understood why some of 
the mummies were in such good condition. 

They were new. 

All of the tools, the tar, the linen—they had been used by descendants 
of Khala, descendants like Ahmed. Since the time of Khala, anyone who 
had entered the chamber—the chamber we were now standing in—had 
been mummified. 

Alive. 

And now Sari and I were about to become mummies, too. 

“Ahmed, you can’tl” Sari cried. She let go of my hand and balled her 
hands into angry fists at her side. 

“It is the will of Khala,” he replied softly, his dark eyes glowing in the 
light of the torch. 

I saw a long-bladed dagger appear in his free hand. The blade caught 
the light from the torch. 

Sari and I both took a step back as Ahmed began moving toward us 
with quick, determined strides. 



17 


As Ahmed approached, Sari and I shrank back to the center of the chamber. 

Run, I thought. 

We can run away from him. 

My eyes searched frantically for a place we could escape through. 

But there was no way out. 

The tunnel in the corner appeared to be the only opening. And we’d 
have to run right past Ahmed to get to it. 

Sari, I saw, was frantically pressing the beeper at her waist. She 
glanced at me, her features tight with fear. 

“Yowwww!” 

I cried out as I suddenly backed into someone. 

I turned and stared into the bandaged face of a mummy. 

With a loud gasp, I lurched away from it. 

“Let’s make a run for the tunnel,” I whispered to Sari, my throat so dry 
and tight, I could barely make myself heard. “He can’t get both of us.” 

Sari stared back at me, confused. I don’t know if she heard me or not. 

“There is no escape,” Ahmed said softly, as if reading my thoughts. 
“There is no escape from Khala’s curse.” 

“He—he’s going to kill us!” Sari screamed. 

“You have violated her sacred chamber,” Ahmed said, raising the torch 
high, holding the dagger at his waist. 

He stepped nearer. “I saw you yesterday climb into the sacred 
sarcophagus. I saw you two playing in Khala’s holy chamber. It was then 
that I knew I had to carry out my sacred duties. I—” 

Sari and I both cried out as something dropped from the chamber 
ceiling. 

All three of us looked up to see a rope ladder dangling from the hole I 
had fallen through. It swung back and forth as it was lowered, nearly to the 
floor. 

“Are you down there? I’m coming down!” Uncle Ben shouted down to 
us. 



“Uncle Ben—no!” I screamed. 

But he was already moving down the ladder, making his way quickly, 
the ladder steadying under his weight. 

Halfway down, he stopped and peered into the chamber. “What on 
earth—?” he cried, his eyes roaming over the amazing scene. 

And then he saw Ahmed. 

“Ahmed, what are you doing here?” Uncle Ben cried in surprise. He 
quickly lowered himself to the floor, jumping down the last three rungs. 

“Merely carrying out Khala’s wishes,” Ahmed said, his face 
expressionless now, his eyes narrowed in anticipation. 

“Khala? The Priestess?” Uncle Ben wrinkled his features in confusion. 

“He’s going to kill us!” Sari cried, mshing up to her dad, throwing her 
arms around his waist. “Daddy—he’s going to kill us! And then turn us into 
mummies !” 

Uncle Ben held Sari and looked over her shoulder accusingly at 
Ahmed. “Is this true?” 

“The chamber has been violated. It has fallen to me, Doctor, to carry 
out the curse.” 

Uncle Ben put his hands on Sari’s trembling shoulders and gently 
moved her aside. Then he began to make his way slowly, steadily, toward 
Ahmed. 

“Ahmed, let us go out of here and discuss this,” he said, raising his 
right hand as if offering it in friendship. 

Ahmed took a step back, raising the torch menacingly. “The Priestess’ 
will must not be ignored.” 

“Ahmed, you are a scientist, and so am I,” Uncle Ben said. I couldn’t 
believe how calm he sounded. I wondered if it was an act. 

The scene was tense. We were in such terrifying danger. 

But I felt just a little bit calmer knowing that my uncle was here, 
knowing that he’d be able to handle Ahmed and get us out of here—alive. 

I glanced reassuringly at Sari, who was staring hard, biting her lower 
lip in tense concentration as her father approached Ahmed. 

“Ahmed, put down the torch,” Uncle Ben urged, his hand extended. 
“The dagger, too. Please. Let’s discuss this, scientist to scientist.” 

“What is there to discuss?” Ahmed asked softly, his eyes studying 
Uncle Ben intently. “The will of Khala must be carried out, as it has been 



for four thousand years. That cannot be discussed.” 

“As scientist to scientist,” Uncle Ben repeated, returning Ahmed’s 
stare as if challenging him. “The curse is ancient. Khala has had her way for 
many centuries. Perhaps it is time to let it rest. Lower your weapons, 
Ahmed. Let’s talk about this. Scientist to scientist.” 

It’s going to be okay, I thought, breathing a long sigh of relief. It’s all 
going to be okay. We’re going to get out of here. 

But then Ahmed moved with startling quickness. 

Without warning, without a word, he pulled back his arms and, 
gripping the torch handle with both hands, swung it as hard as he could at 
Uncle Ben’s head. 

The torch made a loud thonk as it connected with the side of Uncle 
Ben’s face. 

The orange flames danced up. 

A swirl of bright color. 

And then shadows. 

Uncle Ben groaned. His eyes bulged wide with surprise. 

With pain. 

The torch hadn’t set him aflame. But the blow knocked him out. 

He slumped to his knees. Then his eyes closed, and he dropped limply 
to the floor. 

Ahmed raised the torch high, his eyes gleaming with excitement, with 
triumph. 

And I knew we were doomed. 



18 


“Daddy!” 

Sari rushed to her father and knelt at his side. 

But Ahmed moved quickly, thrusting the torch toward her, holding the 
dagger ready, forcing her to back away. 

A thin trickle of blood, glowing darkly in the light of the fire, rolled 
down the side of Uncle Ben’s face. He groaned, but didn’t stir. 

I glanced quickly at the mummies scattered around the room. It was 
hard to believe that we would soon be one of them. 

I thought of leaping at Ahmed, trying to knock him over. I imagined 
grabbing the torch, swinging it at him, forcing him against the wall. Forcing 
him to let us escape. 

But the blade of the dagger glowed, as if warning me to stay back. 

I’m just a kid, I thought. 

Thinking I could beat a grown man with a knife and a torch was just 
crazy. 

Crazy. 

The whole scene was crazy. And terrifying. 

I suddenly felt sick. My stomach tightened, and a wave of nausea 
swept over me. 

“Let us go—now!” Sari screamed at Ahmed. 

To my surprise, he reacted by swinging back the torch and heaving it 
across the room. 

It landed with a soft plop in the center of the tar pit. Instantly, the 
surface of the tar burst into flames. The flames spread, leaping up toward 
the chamber ceiling, until the entire square was aflame. 

As I stared in amazement, the tar popped and bubbled beneath the 
orange and red covering of flames. 

“We must wait for it to boil,” Ahmed said calmly, the shadows cast by 
the flames flickering across his face and clothing. 

The chamber grew thick with smoke. Sari and I both started to cough. 

Ahmed bent down and put his hands under Uncle Ben’s shoulders. He 
began to drag him across the floor. 



“Leave him alone!” Sari screamed, running frantically toward Ahmed. 

I saw that she was going to try to fight him. 

I grabbed her shoulders and held her back. 

We were no match for Ahmed. He had already knocked Uncle Ben 
unconscious. There was no telling what he would do to us. 

Holding onto Sari, I stared at him. What did he plan to do now? 

It didn’t take long to find out. 

With surprising strength, he pulled Uncle Ben across the floor to one 
of the open mummy cases against the wall. Then he hoisted him over the 
side and shoved him into the case. Not even the slightest bit out of breath, 
Ahmed slid the lid closed over my unconscious uncle. 

Then he turned to us. “You two—into that one.” He pointed to an 
enormous mummy case on a tall pedestal next to Uncle Ben’s. It was nearly 
as tall as I was, and at least ten feet long. It must have been built to hold a 
mummified person—and all of his or her possessions. 

“Let us go!” Sari insisted. “Let us out of here. We won’t tell anyone 
what happened. Really!” 

“Please climb into the case,” Ahmed insisted patiently. “We must wait 
for the tar to be ready.” 

“We’re not going in there,” I said. 

I was shaking all over. I could feel the blood pulsing at my temples. I 
didn’t even realize I was saying what I was saying. I was so scared, I didn’t 
even hear myself. 

I glanced at Sari. She stood defiantly with her arms crossed tightly 
over her chest. But despite her brave pose, I could see her chin trembling 
and her eyes beginning to tear. 

“Into the coffin,” Ahmed repeated, “to await your fate. Khala will not 
be kept waiting. The ancient curse will be carried out in her name.” 

“No!” I cried angrily. 

I stood on tiptoe and peered into the enormous mummy case. It 
smelled so sour in there, I nearly hurled. 

The case was made of wood. It was warped and stained and peeling 
inside. In the flickering light, I was sure I saw dozens of insects crawling 
around in there. 

“Get into the case now!” Ahmed demanded. 



19 


Sari climbed up over the side and lowered herself into the ancient mummy 
case. She always had to be first at everything. But this was one time I didn’t 
mind. 

I hesitated, resting my hand on the rotting wood on the side of the 
case. I glanced at the case next to it, the case with Uncle Ben inside. It was 
carved of stone, and the heavy stone lid was closed, sealing it up tight. 

Did Uncle Ben have any air in there? I wondered, gripped with fear. 
Was he able to breathe? 

And, then, I thought glumly, what difference does it make? All three of 
us are going to be dead soon. All three of us are going to be mummies, 
locked away in this hidden chamber forever. 

“Get in—now!” Ahmed ordered, his dark eyes burning into mine. 

“I—I’m just a kid\” I cried. I don’t know where the words came from. 
I was so scared, I really didn’t know what I was saying. 

An unpleasant sneer formed on Ahmed’s face. “Many of the pharaohs 
were your age at death,” he said. 

I wanted to keep him talking. I had the desperate idea that if I could 
keep the conversation going, I could get us out of this mess. 

But I couldn’t think of anything to say. My brain just froze. 

“Get in,” Ahmed ordered, moving toward me menacingly. 

Feeling totally defeated, I slid one leg over the side of the rotting 
coffin, raised myself up, and then dropped down beside Sari. 

She had her head bowed, and her eyes shut tight. I think she was 
praying. She didn’t glance up, even when I touched her shoulder. 

The coffin lid began to slide over us. The last thing I saw were the red 
flames leaping up over the pit of tar. Then the lid closed us into complete 
blackness. 

“Gabe...” Sari whispered a few seconds after the lid was closed. “I’m 
frightened.” 

For some reason, her confession made me snicker. She said it with 
such surprise. As if being frightened was a startling new experience. 

“I’m too frightened to be frightened,” I whispered back. 



She grabbed my hand and squeezed it. Her hand was even colder and 
clammier than mine. 

“He’s crazy,” she whispered. 

“Yeah. I know,” I replied, still holding onto her hand. 

“I think there are bugs in here,” she said with a shudder. “I can feel 
them crawling on me.” 

“Me, too,” I told her. I realized I was gritting my teeth. I always do 
that when I’m nervous. And now I was more nervous than I thought was 
humanly possible. 

“Poor Daddy,” Sari said. 

The air in the coffin was already beginning to feel stuffy and hot. I 
tried to ignore the disgusting sour smell, but it had crept into my nostrils, 
and I could even taste it. I held my breath to keep from gagging. 

“We’re going to suffocate in here,” I said glumly. 

“He’s going to kill us before we can suffocate,” Sari wailed. “Ow!” I 
could hear her slap at a bug on her arm. 

“Maybe something will happen,” I told her. Pretty lame. But I couldn’t 
think of what else to say. I couldn’t think. Period. 

“All I keep thinking about is how he’s going to reach in and pull my 
brain out through my nose,” Sari wailed. “Why did you have to tell me that, 
Gabe?” 

It took me a while to reply. Then, all I could say was, “Sorry.” I began 
to picture the same thing, and another wave of nausea swept over me. 

“We can’t just sit here,” I said. “We have to escape.” I tried to ignore 
the thick, sour smell. 

“Huh? How?” 

“Let’s try to push up the lid,” I said. “Maybe if we both push 
together...” 

I counted to three in a low whisper, and we both flattened our hands 
against the coffin top and pushed up as hard as we could. 

No. The lid wouldn’t budge. 

“Maybe he’s locked it or put something heavy on top of it,” Sari 
suggested with a miserable sigh. 

“Maybe,” I replied, feeling just as miserable. 

We sat in silence for a while. I could hear Sari breathing. She was sort 
of sobbing as she breathed. I realized my heart was racing. I could feel my 



temples throbbing. 

I pictured the long hook that Ahmed would use to pull our brains out 
of our heads. I tried to force the thought out of my mind, but it wouldn’t go 
away. 

I remembered being a mummy two Halloweens ago, and how the 
costume unraveled in front of my friends. 

Little did I know then that I’d soon have a mummy costume that 
would never unravel. 

Time passed. I don’t know how long. 

I realized I had been sitting with my legs crossed. Now they were 
beginning to fall asleep. I uncrossed them and stretched them out. The 
mummy case was so big, Sari and I could both lie down if we wanted to. 

But we were too tense and terrified to lie down. 

I was the first to hear the scrabbling sound. Like something climbing 
quickly around inside the mummy case. 

At first I thought it was Sari. But she grabbed my hand with her icy 
hand, and I realized she hadn’t moved from in front of me. 

We both listened hard. 

Something near us, something right next to us, bumped the side of the 

case. 

A mummy? 

Was there a mummy in the case with us? 

Moving ? 

I heard a soft groan. 

Sari squeezed my hand so tightly, it hurt, and I uttered a sharp cry. 

Another sound. Closer. 

“Gabe—” Sari whispered, her voice tiny and shrill. “Gabe—there’s 
something in here with us!” 



20 


It’s not a mummy, I told myself. 

It can’t be. 

It’s a bug. A very large bug. Moving across the coffin floor. 

It’s not a mummy. It’s not a mummy. 

The words repeated in my mind. 

I didn’t have too long to think about it. Whatever it was crept closer. 

“Hey!” a voice whispered. 

Sari and I both shrieked. 

“Where are you guys?” 

We recognized the voice immediately. 

“Uncle Ben!” I cried, swallowing hard, my heart pounding. 

“Daddy!” Sari lunged over me to get to her father. 

“But how?” I stammered. “How did you get in here?” 

“Easy,” he replied, squeezing my shoulder reassuringly. 

“Daddy—I don’t believe it!” Sari wailed. I couldn’t see in the 
blackness of the closed coffin, but I think she was crying. 

“I’m okay. I’m okay,” he repeated several times, trying to calm her 
down. 

“How did you get out of that case and into this one?” I asked, totally 
confused and amazed. 

“There’s an escape hatch,” Uncle Ben explained. “A small opening 
with a doorway. The Egyptians built hidden doorways and escape hatches 
into many of their mummy cases. For the corpse’s soul to be able to leave.” 

“Wow,” I said. I didn’t know what to say. 

“Ahmed is so caught up in his ancient curse mumbo jumbo, he’s 
forgotten about this little detail,” Uncle Ben said. I felt his hand on my 
shoulder again. “Come on, you two. Follow me.” 

“But he’s out there—” I started. 

“No,” Uncle Ben replied quickly. “He’s slipped away. When I climbed 
out of my case, I looked for him. I didn’t see him anywhere. Maybe he went 
somewhere else while he’s waiting for the tar to get hot enough. Or maybe 



he decided to just leave us in the mummy cases to suffocate.” 

I felt a bug slither up my leg. I slapped at it, then tried to pull it out 
from inside the leg of my jeans. 

“Out we go,” Uncle Ben said. 

I heard him groan as he turned in the enormous coffin. Then I could 
hear him crawling to the back. 

I saw a small rectangle of light as he pushed open the hidden door in 
the back of the case. It was a very small escape hatch, just big enough for us 
to squeeze through. 

I followed Uncle Ben and Sari out of the case, flattening myself to 
crawl out the small opening, then dropping onto all fours on the chamber 
floor. 

It took a while for my eyes to adjust to the brightness. 

The red flames still danced over the pit of bubbling tar, casting eerie 
blue shadows on all four chamber walls. The mummies stood as before, 
frozen in place around the room, shadows flickering over their faceless 
forms. 

As my eyes began to focus, I saw that Uncle Ben had an enormous, 
dark bruise on the side of his head. A wide ribbon of dried blood streaked 
down his cheek. 

“Let’s get out of here before Ahmed comes back,” he whispered, 
standing between us, one hand on each of our shoulders. 

Sari looked pale and trembly. Her lower lip was bleeding from her 
chewing on it so hard. 

Uncle Ben started toward the rope ladder in the center of the chamber, 
but then stopped. “It’ll take too long,” he said, thinking out loud. “Come on. 
To the tunnel. Hurry.” 

All three of us started jogging toward the tunnel in the corner. Looking 
down, I saw that my stupid shoelace had come untied again. But there was 
no way I was going to stop to tie it! 

We were about to get out of there! 

A few seconds before, I had given up all hope. But now, here we were 
out of the mummy case and heading to freedom. 

We were just a few yards in front of the tunnel entrance when the 
tunnel suddenly filled with orange light. 

Then, from out of the tunnel, Ahmed emerged, holding a new torch in 



front of him, the flames revealing a startled look on his face. 

“No!” Sari and I cried in unison. 

All three of us skidded to a halt right in front of him. 

“You cannot escape!” Ahmed said softly, quickly regaining his 
composure, his startled expression tightening to anger. “You will not 
escape!” 

He thrust the torch toward Uncle Ben, who was forced to fall 
backwards, out of reach of the hissing flames. He landed hard on his elbows 
and cried out in pain. 

His cry brought a grim smile to Ahmed’s lips. “You have made Khala 
angry,” he announced, raising the torch above his head and reaching for the 
dagger sheathed at his waist. “You will not join the other violators of this 
chamber.” 

Whew. I breathed a sigh of relief. 

Ahmed had changed his mind. He wasn’t going to turn us into 
mummies after all. 

“The three of you will die in the tar pit,” he declared. 

Sari and I exchanged horrified glances. Uncle Ben had climbed back to 
his feet and put his arms around us. “Ahmed, can’t we talk about this 
calmly and rationally as scientists?” he asked. 

“To the tar pit,” Ahmed ordered, thrusting the flaming torch angrily at 
us. 

“Ahmed— please !” Uncle Ben cried in a whining, frightened tone I’d 
never heard from him before. 

Ahmed ignored Uncle Ben’s desperate pleas. Pushing the torch at our 
backs and gesturing with the long-bladed dagger, he forced us to make our 
way to the edge of the pit. 

The tar was bubbling noisily now, making ugly popping and sucking 
sounds. The flames across the top were low and red. 

I tried to pull back. It smelled so bad. And the steam coming off it was 
so hot, it made my face burn. 

“One by one, you will jump,” Ahmed said. 

He was standing a few feet behind us as we stared down into the 
bubbling tar. “If you don’t jump, I will be forced to push you.” 

“Ahmed—” Uncle Ben began. But Ahmed brushed the torch against 
Ben’s back. 



“It has come to me,” Ahmed said solemnly. “The honor of carrying out 
Khala’s wishes.” 

The tar fumes were so overwhelming, I thought I was going to faint. 
The pit started to tilt in front of me. I felt very dizzy. 

I shoved my hands into my jeans pockets, to steady myself, I guess. 
And my hand closed around something I had forgotten about. 

The Summoner. 

The mummy hand that I carry around everywhere. 

I’m not sure why—I wasn’t thinking clearly, if at all—but I pulled out 
the little mummy hand. 

I spun around quickly. And I held the mummy hand up high. 

I can’t really explain what was going through my mind. I was so 
terrified, so overwhelmed with fear, that I was thinking a hundred things at 
once. 

Maybe I thought the mummy hand would distract Ahmed. 

Or interest him. 

Or confuse him. 

Or frighten him. 

Maybe I was just stalling for time. 

Or maybe I was unconsciously remembering the legend behind the 
hand that the kid at the garage sale had told me. 

The legend of why it was called The Summoner. 

How it was used to call up ancient souls and spirits. 

Or maybe I wasn’t thinking anything at all. 

But I spun around and, gripping it by its slender wrist, held the 
mummy hand up high. And waited. Ahmed stared at it. But nothing 
happened. 



21 


I waited, standing there like the Statue of Liberty with the little hand raised 
high above my head. 

It seemed as if I were standing like that for hours. 

Sari and Uncle Ben stared at the hand. 

Lowering the torch a few inches, Ahmed squinted at the mummy hand. 
Then his eyes grew wider, and his mouth dropped open in surprise. 

He cried out. I couldn’t understand what he was saying. The words 
were in a language I’d never heard. Ancient Egyptian, maybe. 

He took a step back, his surprised expression quickly replaced by a 
wide-eyed look of fear. 

“The hand of the Priestess!” he cried. 

At least, that’s what I think he cried—because I was suddenly 
distracted by what was going on behind him. 

Sari uttered a low cry. 

All three of us stared over Ahmed’s shoulder in disbelief. 

A mummy propped against the wall appeared to lean forward. 

Another mummy, lying on its back, slowly sat up, creaking as it raised 
itself. 

“No!” I cried, still holding the mummy hand high. 

Sari and Uncle Ben were gaping wide-eyed as the vast chamber filled 
with motion. As the mummies creaked and groaned to life. 

The air filled with the odor of ancient dust, of decay. 

In the shadowy light, I saw one mummy, then another, straighten up, 
stand tall. They stretched their bandaged arms above their featureless heads. 
Slowly. Painfully. 

Staggering, moving stiffly, the mummies lumbered forward. 

I watched, frozen in amazement, as they climbed out of mummy cases, 
raised themselves from the floor, leaned forward, took their first slow, 
heavy steps, their muscles groaning, dust rising up from their dry, dead 
bodies. 

They’re dead, I thought. 

All of them. Dead. Dead for so many years. 



But now they were rising up, climbing from their ancient coffins, 
struggling toward us on their heavy, dead legs. 

Their bandaged feet scraped across the chamber floor as they gathered 
in a group. 

Scrape. Scrape. Scrape. 

A dry, shuffling sound I knew I’d never forget. 

Scrape. Scrape. 

The faceless army approached. Bandaged arms outstretched, they 
lumbered toward us, creaking and groaning. Moaning softly with ancient 
pain. 

Ahmed caught the astonishment on our faces and spun around. 

He cried out again in that strange language as he saw the mummies 
advancing on us, scraping so softly, so deliberately, across the chamber 
floor. 

And, then, with a furious scream, Ahmed heaved the torch at the 
mummy in the lead. 

The torch hit the mummy in the chest and bounced to the floor. Flames 
burst from the mummy’s chest, immediately spreading over the arms and 
down the legs. 

But the mummy kept advancing, didn’t slow, didn’t react at all to the 
fire that was quickly consuming it. 

Gaping in openmouthed horror, babbling an endless stream of words in 
that mysterious language, Ahmed tried to run. 

But he was too late. 

The burning mummy lunged at him. The ancient figure caught Ahmed 
up by the throat, lifted him high above its flaming shoulders. 

Ahmed uttered a high-pitched shriek of terror as the other mummies 
lumbered forward. Moaning and wailing through their yellowed bandages, 
they moved in to help their burning colleague. 

They raised Ahmed high above their moaning heads. 

And then held him over the burning tar pit. 

Squirming and kicking, Ahmed uttered a piercing scream as they held 
him over the boiling, bubbling, steaming tar. 

I closed my eyes. The heat and tar fumes swirled around me. I felt as if 
I were being swallowed up, pulled down into the steaming blackness. 

When I opened my eyes, I saw Ahmed fleeing to the tunnel, staggering 



clumsily, shrieking in openmouthed terror as he ran. The mummies 
remained by the pit, enjoying their victory. 

I realized I was still holding the mummy hand over my head. I lowered 
it slowly, and gazed at Sari and Uncle Ben. They were standing beside me, 
their faces filled with confusion. And relief. 

“The mummies—” I managed to utter. 

“Look,” Sari said, pointing. 

I followed the direction of her gaze. The mummies were all back in 
place. Some were leaning, some propped at odd angles, some lying down. 

They were exactly as they had been when I entered the chamber. 

“Huh?” My eyes darted rapidly around the room. 

Had they all moved? Had they raised themselves, stood up, and 
staggered toward us? Or had we imagined it all? 

No. 

We couldn ’t have imagined it. 

Ahmed was gone. We were safe. 

“We’re okay,” Uncle Ben said gratefully, throwing his arms around 
Sari and me. “We’re okay. We’re okay.” 

“We can go now!” Sari cried happily, hugging her dad. Then she 
turned to me. “You saved our lives,” she said. She had to choke out the 
words. But she said them. 

Then Uncle Ben turned his gaze on me and the object I still gripped 
tightly in front of me. “Thanks for the helping hand,” Uncle Ben said. 

We had an enormous dinner at a restaurant back in Cairo. It’s a miracle any 
of us got any food down since we were all talking at once, chattering 
excitedly, reliving our adventure, trying to make sense of it all. 

I was spinning The Summoner around on the table. 

Uncle Ben grinned at me. “I had no idea how special that mummy 
hand was!” 

He took it from me and examined it closely. “Better not play with it,” 
he said seriously. “We must treat it carefully.” He shook his head. “Some 
great scientist / am!” he exclaimed scornfully. 

“When I saw it, I thought it was just a toy, some kind of reproduction. 
But this hand may be my biggest discovery of all!” 

“It’s my good luck charm,” I said, handling it gently as I took it back. 



“You can say that again!” Sari said appreciatively. The nicest thing 
she’d ever said to me. 

Back at the hotel, I surprised myself by falling asleep instantly. I 
thought I’d be up for hours, thinking about all that had happened. But I 
guess all the excitement had exhausted me. 

The next morning, Sari, Uncle Ben, and I had a big breakfast in the 
room. I had a plate of scrambled eggs and a bowl of Frosted Flakes. As I 
ate, I fiddled with the little mummy hand. 

All three of us were feeling good, happy that our frightening adventure 
was over. We were kidding around, teasing each other, laughing a lot. 

After I finished my cereal, I raised the little mummy hand high. “O, 
Summoner,” I chanted in a deep voice, “I summon the ancient spirits. Come 
alive. Come alive again!” 

“Stop it, Gabe,” Sari snapped. She grabbed for the hand, but I swung it 
out of her reach. 

“That isn’t funny,” she said. “You shouldn’t fool around like that.” 

“Are you chicken?” I asked, laughing at her. I could see that she was 
really frightened, which made me enjoy my little joke even more. 

Keeping it away from her, I raised the hand high. “I summon thee, 
ancient spirits of the dead,” I chanted. “Come to me. Come to me now!” 

And there was a loud knock on the door. 

All three of us gasped. 

Uncle Ben knocked over his juice glass. It clattered onto the table and 
spilled. 

I froze with the little hand in the air. 

Another loud knock. 

We heard a scrabbling at the door. The sound of ancient, bandaged 
fingers struggling with the lock. 

Sari and I exchanged horrified glances. 

I slowly lowered the hand as the door swung open. 

Two shadowy figures lumbered into the room. 

“Mom and Dad!” I cried. 

I’ll bet they were surprised at how glad I was to see them. 


LET'S GET INVISIBLE! 
Goosebumps - 06 
R.L. Stine 


1 


I went invisible for the first time on my twelfth birthday. 

It was all Whitey’s fault, in a way. Whitey is my dog. He’s just a mutt, part 
terrier, part everything else. He’s all black, so of course we named him Whitey. 

If Whitey hadn’t been sniffing around in the attic... 

Well, maybe I’d better back up a bit and start at the beginning. 

My birthday was on a rainy Saturday. It was a few minutes before kids 
would start arriving for my birthday party, so I was getting ready. 

Getting ready means brushing my hair. 

My brother is always on my case about my hair. He gives me a hard time 
because I spend so much time in front of the mirror brushing it and checking it 
out. 

The thing is, I just happen to have great hair. It’s very thick and sort of a 
golden brown, and just a little bit wavy. My hair is my best feature, so I like to 
make sure it looks okay. 

Also, I have very big ears. They stick out a lot. So I have to keep making 
sure that my hair covers my ears. It’s important. 

“Max, it’s messed up in back,” my brother, Lefty, said, standing behind me 
as I studied my hair in the front hall mirror. 

His name is really Noah, but I call him Lefty because he’s the only left- 
handed person in our family. Lefty was tossing a softball up and catching it in 
his left hand. He knew he wasn’t supposed to toss that softball around in the 
house, but he always did it anyway. 

Lefty is two years younger than me. He’s not a bad guy, but he has too 
much energy. He always has to be tossing a ball around, drumming his hands on 
the table, hitting something, running around, falling down, leaping into things, 
wrestling with me. You get the idea. Dad says that Lefty has ants in his pants. 
It’s a dumb expression, but it sort of describes my brother. 

I turned and twisted my neck to see the back of my hair. “It is not messed 
up, liar,” I said. 

“Think fast!” Lefty shouted, and he tossed the softball at me. 

I made a grab for it and missed. It hit the wall just below the mirror with a 
loud thud. Lefty and I held our breath, waiting to see if Mom heard the sound. 



But she didn’t. I think she was in the kitchen doing something to the birthday 
cake. 

“That was dumb,” I whispered to Lefty. “You almost broke the mirror.” 

“You’re dumb,” he said. Typical. 

“Why don’t you learn to throw right-handed? Then maybe I could catch it 
sometimes,” I told him. I liked to tease him about being left-handed because he 
really hated it. 

“You stink,” he said, picking up the softball. 

I was used to it. He said it a hundred times a day. I guess he thought it was 
clever or something. 

He’s a good kid for a ten-year-old, but he doesn’t have much of a 
vocabulary. 

“Your ears are sticking out,” he said. 

I knew he was lying. I started to answer him, but the doorbell rang. 

He and I raced down the narrow hallway to the front door. “Hey, it’s my 
party!” I told him. 

But Lefty got to the door first and pulled it open. 

My best friend, Zack, pulled open the screen door and hurried into the 
house. It was starting to rain pretty hard, and he was already soaked. 

He handed me a present, wrapped in silver paper, raindrops dripping off it. 
“It’s a bunch of comic books,” he said. “I already read ’em. The X-Force graphic 
novel is kind of cool.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “They don’t look too wet.” 

Lefty grabbed the present from my hand and ran into the living room with 
it. “Don’t open it!” I shouted. He said he was just starting a pile. 

Zack took off his Red Sox cap, and I got a look at his new haircut. “Wow! 
You look... different,” I said, studying his new look. His black hair was buzzed 
real short on the left side. The rest of it was long, brushed straight to the right. 

“Did you invite girls?” he asked me, “or is it just boys?” 

“Some girls are coming,” I told him. “Erin and April. Maybe my cousin 
Debra.” I knew he liked Debra. 

He nodded thoughtfully. Zack has a real serious face. He has these little 
blue eyes that always look far away, like he’s thinking hard about something. 
Like he’s real deep. 

He’s sort of an intense guy. Not nervous. Just keyed up. And very 
competitive. He has to win at everything. If he comes in second place, he gets 



really upset and kicks the furniture. You know the kind. 

“What are we going to do?” Zack asked, shaking the water off his Red Sox 

cap. 

I shrugged. “We were supposed to be in the back yard. Dad put the 
volleyball net up this morning. But that was before it started to rain. I rented 
some movies. Maybe we’ll watch them.” 

The doorbell rang. Lefty appeared again from out of nowhere, pushed Zack 
and me out of the way, and made a dive for the door. “Oh, it’s you,” I heard him 
say. 

“Thanks for the welcome.” I recognized Erin’s squeaky voice. Some kids 
call Erin “Mouse” because of that voice, and because she’s tiny like a mouse. 
She has short, straight blonde hair, and I think she’s cute, but of course I’d never 
tell anyone that. 

“Can we come in?” I recognized April’s voice next. April is the other girl in 
our group. She has curly black hair and dark, sad eyes. I always thought she was 
really sad, but then I figured out that she’s just shy. 

“The party’s tomorrow,” I heard Lefty tell them. 

“Huh?” Both girls uttered cries of surprise. 

“No, it isn’t,” I shouted. I stepped into the doorway and shoved Lefty out of 
the way. I pushed open the screen door so Erin and April could come in. “You 
know Lefty’s little jokes,” I said, squeezing my brother against the wall. 

“Lefty is a little joke,” Erin said. 

“You’re stupid,” Lefty told her. I pressed him into the wall a little harder, 
leaning against him with all my weight. But he ducked down and scooted away. 

“Happy Birthday,” April said, shaking the rain from her curly hair. She 
handed me a present, wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper. “It’s the only paper 
we had,” she explained, seeing me staring at it. 

“Merry Christmas to you, too,” I joked. The present felt like a CD. 

“I forgot your present,” Erin said. 

“What is it?” I asked, following the girls into the living room. 

“I don’t know. I haven’t bought it yet.” 

Lefty grabbed April’s present out of my hand and ran to put it on top of 
Zack’s present in the corner behind the couch. 

Erin plopped down on the white leather ottoman in front of the armchair. 
April stood at the window, staring out at the rain. 

“We were going to barbecue hot dogs,” I said. 



“They’d be pretty soggy today,” April replied. 

Lefty stood behind the couch, tossing his softball up and catching it one- 
handed. 

“You’re going to break that lamp,” I warned him. 

He ignored me, of course. 

“Who else is coming?” Erin asked. 

Before I could answer, the doorbell rang again. Lefty and I raced to the 
door. He tripped over his own sneakers and went skidding down the hall on his 
stomach. So typical. 

By two-thirty everyone had arrived, fifteen kids in all, and the party got 
started. Well, it didn’t really get started because we couldn’t decide what to do. I 
wanted to watch the Terminator movie I’d rented. But the girls wanted to play 
Twister. 

“It’s my birthday!” I insisted. 

We compromised. We played Twister. Then we watched some of the 
Terminator video until it was time to eat. 

It was a pretty good party. I think everyone had an okay time. Even April 
seemed to be having fun. She was usually really quiet and nervous-looking at 
parties. 

Lefty spilled his Coke and ate his slice of chocolate birthday cake with his 
hands because he thought it was funny. But he was the only animal in the group. 

I told him the only reason he was invited was because he was in the family 
and there was nowhere else we could stash him. He replied by opening his 
mouth up real wide so everyone could see his chewed-up chocolate cake inside. 

After I opened presents, I put the Terminator movie back on. But everyone 
started to leave. I guess it was about five o’clock. It looked much later. It was 
dark as night out, still storming. 

My parents were in the kitchen cleaning up. Erin and April were the only 
ones left. Erin’s mother was supposed to pick them up. She called and said she’d 
be a little late. 

Whitey was standing at the living room window, barking his head off. I 
looked outside. I didn’t see anyone there. I grabbed him with both hands and 
wrestled him away from the window. 

“Let’s go up to my room,” I suggested when I finally got the dumb dog 
quiet. “I got a new Super Nintendo game I want to try.” 

Erin and April gladly followed me upstairs. They didn’t like the Terminator 



movie, for some reason. 

The upstairs hallway was pitch black. I clicked the light switch, but the 
overhead light didn’t come on. “The bulb must be burned out,” I said. 

My room was at the end of the hall. We made our way slowly through the 
darkness. 

“It’s kind of spooky up here,” April said quietly. 

And just as she said it, the linen closet door swung open and, with a 
deafening howl, a dark figure leapt out at us. 



2 


As the girls cried out in horror, the howling creature grabbed me around the 
waist and wrestled me to the floor. 

“Lefty —let go!” I screamed angrily. “You’re not funny!” 

He was laughing like a lunatic. He thought he was a riot. “Gotcha!” he 
cried. “I gotcha good!” 

“We weren’t scared,” Erin insisted. “We knew it was you.” 

“Then why’d you scream?” Lefty asked. 

Erin didn’t have an answer. 

I shoved him off me and climbed to my feet. “That was dumb, Lefty.” 

“How long were you waiting in the linen closet?” April asked. 

“A long time,” Lefty told her. He started to get up, but Whitey ran up to him 
and began furiously licking his face. It tickled so much, Lefty fell onto his back, 
laughing. 

“You scared Whitey, too,” I said. 

“No, I didn’t. Whitey’s smarter than you guys.” Lefty pushed Whitey away. 

Whitey began sniffing at the door across the hall. 

“Where does that door lead, Max?” Erin asked. 

“To the attic,” I told her. 

“You have an attic?” Erin cried. Like it was some kind of big deal. “What’s 
up there? I love attics!” 

“Huh?” I squinted at her in the dark. Sometimes girls are really weird. I 
mean, how could anyone love attics? 

“Just a lot of old junk my grandparents left,” I told her. “This house used to 
be theirs. Mom and Dad stored a lot of their stuff in the attic. We hardly ever go 
up there.” 

“Can we go up and take a look?” Erin asked. 

“I guess,” I said. “I don’t think it’s too big a thrill or anything.” 

“I love old junk,” Erin said. 

“But it’s so dark....” April said softly. I think she was a little scared. 

I opened the door and reached for the light switch just inside. A ceiling light 
clicked on in the attic. It cast a pale yellow light down at us as we stared up the 



steep wooden stairs. 

“See? There’s light up there,” I told April. I started up the stairs. They 
creaked under my sneakers. My shadow was really long. “You coming?” 

“Erin’s mom will be here any minute,” April said. 

“We’ll just go up for a second,” Erin said. She gave April a gentle push. 
“Come on.” 

Whitey trotted past us as we climbed the stairs, his tail wagging excitedly, 
his toenails clicking loudly on the wooden steps. About halfway up, the air grew 
hot and dry. 

I stopped on the top step and looked around. The attic stretched on both 
sides. It was one long room, filled with old furniture, cardboard cartons, old 
clothes, fishing rods, stacks of yellowed magazines—all kinds of junk. 

“Ooh, it smells so musty,” Erin said, moving past me and taking a few steps 
into the vast space. She took a deep breath. “I love that smell!” 

“You’re definitely weird,” I told her. 

Rain drummed loudly against the roof. The sound echoed through the low 
room, a steady roar. It sounded as if we were inside a waterfall. 

All four of us began walking around, exploring. Lefty kept tossing his 
softball up against the ceiling rafters, then catching it as it came down. I noticed 
that April stayed close to Erin. Whitey was sniffing furiously along the wall. 

“Think there are mice up here?” Lefty asked, a devilish grin crossing his 
face. I saw April’s eyes go wide. “Big fat mice who like to climb up girls’ legs?” 
Lefty teased. 

My kid brother has a great sense of humor. 

“Could we go now?” April asked impatiently. She started back toward the 
stairway. 

“Look at these old magazines,” Erin exclaimed, ignoring her. She picked 
one up and started flipping through it. “Check this out. The clothes these models 
are wearing are a riot!” 

“Hey—what’s Whitey doing?” Lefty asked suddenly. 

I followed his gaze to the far wall. Behind a tall stack of cartons, I could see 
Whitey’s tail wagging. And I could hear him scratching furiously at something. 

“Whitey—come!” I commanded. 

Of course he ignored me. He began scratching harder. 

“Whitey, what are you scratching at?” 

“Probably pulling a mouse apart,” Lefty suggested. 



“I’m outta here!” April exclaimed. 

“Whitey?” I called. Stepping around an old dining room table, I made my 
way across the cluttered attic. I quickly saw that he was scratching at the bottom 
of a door. 

“Hey, look,” I called to the others. “Whitey found a hidden door.” 

“Cool!” Erin cried, hurrying over. Lefty and April were right behind. 

“I didn’t know this was up here,” I said. 

“We’ve got to check it out,” Erin urged. “Let’s see what’s on the other 
side.” 

And that’s when the trouble all began. 

You can understand why I say it was all Whitey’s fault, right? If that dumb 
dog hadn’t started sniffing and scratching there, we might never have found the 
hidden attic room. 

And we never would have discovered the exciting—and frightening—secret 
behind that wooden door.

“Whitey!” I knelt down and pulled the dog away from the door. “What’s your 
problem, doggie?” 

As soon as I moved him aside, Whitey lost all interest in the door. He 
trotted off and started sniffing another corner. Talk about your short attention 
span. But I guess that’s the difference between dogs and people. 

The rain continued to pound down, a steady roar just above our heads. I 
could hear the wind whistling around the corner of the house. It was a real spring 
storm. 

The door had a rusted latch about halfway up. It slid off easily, and the 
warped wooden door started to swing open before I even pulled at it. 

The door hinges squeaked as I pulled the door toward me, revealing solid 
darkness on the other side. 

Before I had gotten the door open halfway, Lefty scooted under me and 
darted into the dark room. 

“A dead bodyl” he shrieked. 

“Noooo!” April and Erin both cried out with squeals of terror. 

But I knew Lefty’s dumb sense of humor. “Nice try, Lefty,” I said, and 
followed him through the doorway. 

Of course he was just goofing. 

I found myself in a small, windowless room. The only light came from the 
pale yellow ceiling light behind us in the center of the attic. 

“Push the door all the way open so the light can get in,” I instructed Erin. “I 
can’t see a thing in here.” 

Erin pushed open the door and slid a carton over to hold it in place. Then 
she and April crept in to join Lefty and me. 

“It’s too big to be a closet,” Erin said, her voice sounding even squeakier 
than usual. “So what is it?” 

“Just a room, I guess,” I said, still waiting for my eyes to adjust to the dim 

light. 

I took another step into the room. And as I did, a dark figure stepped toward 
me. 


I screamed and jumped back. 



The other person jumped back, too. 

“It’s a mirror, dork!” Lefty said, and started to laugh. 

Instantly, all four of us were laughing. Nervous, high-pitched laughter. 

It was a mirror in front of us. In the pale yellow light filtering into the 
small, square room, I could see it clearly now. 

It was a big, rectangular mirror, about two feet taller than me, with a dark 
wood frame. It rested on a wooden base. 

I moved closer to it and my reflection moved once again to greet me. To my 
surprise, the reflection was clear. No dust on the glass, despite the fact that no 
one had been in here in ages. 

I stepped in front of it and started to check out my hair. 

I mean, that’s what mirrors are for, right? 

“Who would put a mirror in a room all by itself?” Erin asked. I could see 
her dark reflection in the mirror, a few feet behind me. 

“Maybe it’s a valuable piece of furniture or something,” I said, reaching 
into my jeans pocket for my comb. “You know. An antique.” 

“Did your parents put it up here?” Erin asked. 

“I don’t know,” I replied. “Maybe it belonged to my grandparents. I just 
don’t know.” I ran the comb through my hair a few times. 

“Can we go now? This isn’t too thrilling,” April said. She was still lingering 
reluctantly in the doorway. 

“Maybe it was a carnival mirror,” Lefty said, pushing me out of the way 
and making faces into the mirror, bringing his face just inches from the glass. 
“You know. One of those fun house mirrors that makes your body look like it’s 
shaped like an egg.” 

“You’re already shaped like an egg,” I joked, pushing him aside. “At least, 
your head is.” 

“You’re a rotten egg,” he snapped back. “You stink.” 

I peered into the mirror. I looked perfectly normal, not distorted at all. “Hey, 
April, come in,” I urged. “You’re blocking most of the light.” 

“Can’t we just leave?” she asked, whining. Reluctantly, she moved from the 
doorway, taking a few small steps into the room. “Who cares about an old 
mirror, anyway?” 

“Hey, look,” I said, pointing. I had spotted a light attached to the top of the 
mirror. It was oval-shaped, made of brass or some other kind of metal. The bulb 
was long and narrow, almost like a fluorescent bulb, only shorter. 



I gazed up at it, trying to figure it out in the dim light. “How do you turn it 
on, I wonder.” 

“There’s a chain,” Erin said, coming up beside me. 

Sure enough, a slender chain descended from the right side of the lamp, 
hanging down about a foot from the top of the mirror. 

“Wonder if it works,” I said. 

“The bulb’s probably dead,” Lefty remarked. Good old Lefty. Always an 
optimist. 

“Only one way to find out,” I said. Standing on tiptoes, I stretched my hand 
up to the chain. 

“Be careful,” April warned. 

“Huh? It’s just a light,” I told her. 

Lamous last words. 

I reached up. Missed. Tried again. I grabbed the chain on the second try and 
pulled. 

The light came on with a startlingly bright flash. Then it dimmed down to 
normal light. Very white light that reflected brightly in the mirror. 

“Hey—that’s better!” I exclaimed. “It lights up the whole room. Pretty 
bright, huh?” 

No one said anything. 

“I said, pretty bright, huh?” 

Still silence from my companions. 

I turned around and was surprised to find looks of horror on all three faces. 

“Max?” Lefty cried, staring hard at me, his eyes practically popping out of 
his head. 

“Max—where are you?” Erin cried. She turned to April. “Where’d he go?” 

“I’m right here,” I told them. “I haven’t moved.” 

“But we can’t see you! ” April cried.

All three of them were staring in my direction with their eyes bulging and looks 
of horror still on their faces. But I could tell they were goofing. 

“Give me a break, guys,” I said. “I’m not as stupid as I look. No way I’m 
falling for your dumb joke.” 

“But, Max—” Lefty insisted. “We’re seriousl” 

“We can’t see you!” Erin repeated. 

Dumb, dumb, dumb. 

Suddenly, the light started to hurt my eyes. It seemed to grow brighter. It 
was shining right in my face. 

Shielding my eyes with one hand, I reached up with the other hand and 
pulled the chain. 

The light went out, but the white glare stayed with me. I tried to blink it 
away, but I still saw large bright spots before my eyes. 

“Hey—you’re back!” Lefty cried. He stepped up and grabbed my arm and 
squeezed it, as if he were testing it, making sure I was real or something. 

“What’s your problem?” I snapped. I was starting to get angry. “I didn’t fall 
for your dumb joke, Lefty. So why keep it up?” 

To my surprise, Lefty didn’t back away. He held onto my arm as if he were 
afraid to let go. 

“We weren’t joking, Max,” Erin insisted in a low voice. “We really couldn’t 
see you.” 

“It must have been the light in the mirror,” April said. She was pressed 
against the wall next to the doorway. “It was so bright. I think it was just an 
optical illusion or something.” 

“It wasn’t an optical illusion,” Erin told her. “I was standing right next to 
Max. And I couldn’t see him.” 

“He was invisible,” Lefty added solemnly. 

I laughed. “You guys are trying to scare me,” I said. “And you’re doing a 
pretty good job of it!” 

“You scared us!” Lefty exclaimed. He let go of my arm and stepped up to 
the mirror. 

I followed his gaze. “There I am,” I said, pointing to my reflection. A strand 



of hair was poking up in back of my head. I carefully slicked it down. 

“Let’s get out of here,” April pleaded. 

Lefty started to toss his softball up, studying himself in the mirror. 

Erin made her way around to the back of the mirror. “It’s too dark back 
here. I can’t see anything,” she said. 

She stepped around to the front and stared up at the oval-shaped lamp on 
top. “You disappeared as soon as you pulled the chain on that lamp.” 

“You’re really serious!” I said. For the first time I began to believe they 
weren’t joking. 

“You were invisible, Max,” Erin said. “Poof. You were gone.” 

“She’s right,” Lefty agreed, tossing the softball up and catching it, admiring 
his form in the mirror. 

“It was just an optical illusion,” April insisted. “Why are you guys making 
such a big deal about it?” 

“It wasn’t !” Erin insisted. 

“He clicked on the light. Then he disappeared in a flash,” Lefty said. He 
dropped the softball. It bounced loudly on the hardwood floor, then rolled behind 
the mirror. 

He hesitated for a few seconds. Then he went after it, diving for the ball in 
the darkness. A few seconds later, he came running back. 

“You really were invisible, Max,” he said. 

“Really,” Erin added, staring hard at me. 

“Prove it,” I told them. 

“Let’s go !” April pleaded. She had moved to the doorway and was standing 
half in, half out of the room. 

“What do you mean prove it!” Erin asked, talking to my dark reflection in 
the mirror. 

“Show me,” I said. 

“You mean do what you did?” Erin asked, turning to talk to the real me. 

“Yeah,” I said. “You go invisible, too. Just like I did.” 

Erin and Lefty stared at me. Lefty’s mouth dropped open. 

“This is dumb,” April called from behind us. 

“I’ll do it,” Lefty said. He stepped up to the mirror. 

I pulled him back by the shoulders. “Not you,” I said. “You’re too young.” 

He tried to pull out of my grasp, but I held onto him. “How about you, 
Erin?” I urged, wrapping my arms around Lefty’s waist to keep him back from 



the mirror. 

She shrugged. “Okay. I’ll try, I guess.” 

Lefty stopped struggling to get away. I loosened my grip a little. 

We watched Erin step up in front of the mirror. Her reflection stared back at 
her, dark and shadowy. 

She stood on tiptoes, reached up, and grabbed the lamp chain. She glanced 
over at me and smiled. “Here goes,” she said.

The chain slipped from Erin’s hand. 

She reached up and grabbed it again. 

She was just about to tug at it when a woman’s voice interrupted from 
downstairs. “Erin! Are you up there? April?” 

I recognized the voice. Erin’s mom. 

“Yeah. We’re up here,” Erin shouted. She let go of the chain. 

“Hurry down. We’re late!” her mom called. “What are you doing up in the 
attic, anyway?” 

“Nothing,” Erin called down. She turned to me and shrugged. 

“Good. I’m outta here!” April exclaimed, and hurried to the stairway. 

We all followed her down, clumping noisily down the creaking wooden 
stairs. 

“What were you doing up there?” my mom asked when we were all in the 
living room. “It’s so dusty in that attic. It’s a wonder you’re not filthy.” 

“We were just hanging out,” I told her. 

“We were playing with an old mirror,” Lefty said. “It was kind of neat.” 

“Playing with a mirror?” Erin’s mom flashed my mom a bewildered glance. 

“See you guys,” Erin said, pulling her mom to the door. “Great party, Max.” 

“Yeah. Thanks,” April added. 

They headed out the front door. The rain had finally stopped. I stood at the 
screen door and watched them step around the puddles on the walk as they made 
their way to the car. 

When I turned back into the living room, Lefty was tossing the softball up 
to the ceiling, trying to catch it behind his back. He missed. The ball bounced up 
from the floor onto an end table, where it knocked over a large vase of tulips. 

What a crash! 

The vase shattered. Tulips went flying. All the water poured down onto the 
carpet. 

Mom tossed up her hands and said something silently up to the sky, the way 
she always does when she’s very pushed out of shape about something. 

Then she really got on Lefty’s case. She started screaming: “How many 



times do I have to tell you not to throw that ball in the house?” Stuff like that. 
She kept it up for quite a while. 

Lefty shrank into a corner and tried to make himself tinier and tinier. He 
kept saying he was sorry, but Mom was yelling so loud, I don’t think she heard 
him. 

I bet Lefty wanted to be invisible right at that moment. 

But he had to stand and take his punishment. 

Then he and I helped clean up the mess. 

A few minutes later, I saw him tossing the softball up in the living room 
again. 

That’s the thing about Lefty. He never learns. 

I didn’t think about the mirror again for a couple of days. I got busy with school 
and other stuff. Rehearsing for the spring concert. I’m only in the chorus, but I 
still have to go to every rehearsal. 

I saw Erin and April in school a lot. But neither of them mentioned the 
mirror. I guess maybe it slipped their minds, too. Or maybe we all just shut it out 
of our minds. 

It was kind of scary, if you stopped to think about it. 

I mean, if you believed what they said happened. 

Then that Wednesday night I couldn’t get to sleep. I was lying there, staring 
up at the ceiling, watching the shadows sway back and forth. 

I tried counting sheep. I tried shutting my eyes real tight and counting 
backwards from one thousand. 

But I was really keyed up, for some reason. Not at all sleepy. 

Suddenly I found myself thinking about the mirror up in the attic. 

What was it doing up there? I asked myself. Why was it closed up in that 
hidden room with the door carefully latched? 

Who did it belong to? My grandparents? If so, why would they hide it in 
that tiny room? 

I wondered if Mom and Dad even knew it was up there. 

I started thinking about what had happened on Saturday after my birthday 
party. I pictured myself standing in front of the mirror. Combing my hair. Then 
reaching for the chain. Pulling it. The flash of bright light as the lamp went on. 
And then... 

Did I see my reflection in the mirror after the light went on? 



I couldn’t remember. 

Did I see myself at all? My hands? My feet? 

I couldn’t remember. 

“It was a joke,” I said aloud, lying in my bed, kicking the covers off me. 

It had to be a joke. 

Lefty was always playing dumb jokes on me, trying to make me look bad. 
My brother was a joker. He’d always been a joker. He was never serious. Never. 

So what made me think he was serious now? 

Because Erin and April had agreed with him? 

Before I realized it, I had climbed out of bed. 

Only one way to find out if they were serious or not, I told myself. I 
searched in the darkness for my bedroom slippers. I buttoned my pajama shirt 
which had come undone from all my tossing and turning. 

Then, as silent as I could be, I crept out into the hallway. 

The house was dark except for the tiny night-light down by the floor just 
outside Lefty’s bedroom. Lefty was the only one in the family who ever got up 
in the middle of the night. He insisted on having a night-light in his room and 
one in the hall, even though I made fun of him about it as often as I could. 

Now I was grateful for the light as I made my way on tiptoe to the attic 
stairs. Even though I was being so careful, the floorboards squeaked under my 
feet. It’s just impossible not to make noise in an old house like this. 

I stopped and held my breath, listening hard, listening for any sign that I 
had been heard. 

Silence. 

Taking a deep breath, I opened the attic door, fumbled around till I found 
the light switch, and clicked on the attic light. Then I made my way slowly up 
the steep stairs, leaning ah my weight on the banister, trying my hardest not to 
make the stairs creak. 

It seemed to take forever to get ah the way up. Finally, I stopped at the top 
step and gazed around, letting my eyes adjust to the yellow glare of the ceiling 
light. 

The attic was hot and stuffy. The air was so dry, it made my nose burn. I 
had a sudden urge to turn around and go back. 

But then my eyes stopped at the doorway to the small, hidden room. In our 
hurry to leave, we had left the door wide open. 

Staring at the darkness beyond the open doorway, I stepped onto the 



landing and made my way quickly across the cluttered floor. The floorboards 
creaked and groaned beneath me, but I barely heard them. 

I was drawn to the open doorway, drawn to the mysterious room as if being 
pulled by a powerful magnet. 

I had to see the tall mirror again. I had to examine it, study it closely. 

I had to know the truth about it. 

I stepped into the small room without hesitating and walked up to the 
mirror. 

I paused for a moment and studied my shadowy reflection in the glass. My 
hair was totally messed up, but I didn’t care. 

I stared at myself, stared into my eyes. Then I took a step back to get a 
different view. 

The mirror reflected my entire body from head to foot. There wasn’t 
anything special about the reflection. It wasn’t distorted or weird in any way. 

The fact that it was such a normal reflection helped to calm me. I hadn’t 
realized it, but my heart was fluttering like a nervous butterfly. My hands and 
feet were cold as ice. 

“Chill out, Max,” I whispered to myself, watching myself whisper in the 
dark mirror. 

I did a funny little dance for my own benefit, waving my hands above my 
head and shaking my whole body. 

“Nothing special about this mirror,” I said aloud. 

I reached out and touched it. The glass felt cool despite the warmth of the 
room. I ran my hand along the glass until I reached the frame. Then I let my 
hand wander up and down the wood frame. It also felt smooth and cool. 

It’s just a mirror, I thought, finally feeling more relaxed. Just an old mirror 
that someone stored up here long ago and forgot about. 

Still holding onto the frame, I walked around to the back. It was too dark to 
see clearly, but it didn’t seem too interesting back here. 

Well, I might as well turn on the light at the top, I thought. 

I returned to the front of the mirror. Standing just inches back from it, I 
began to reach up for the lamp chain when something caught my eye. 

“Oh!” 

I cried out as I saw two eyes, down low in the mirror. Two eyes staring out 
at me. 



6 


My breath caught in my throat. I peered down into the dark reflection. 

The two eyes peered up at me. Dark and evil eyes. 

Uttering a cry of panic, I turned away from the mirror. 

“Lefty!” I cried. My voice came out shrill and tight, as if someone were 
squeezing my throat. 

He grinned at me from just inside the doorway. 

I realized that it had been Lefty’s eyes reflected in the mirror. 

I ran over to him and grabbed him by the shoulders. “You scared me to 
death!” I half-screamed, half-whispered. 

His grin grew wider. “You’re stupid,” he said. 

I wanted to strangle him. He thought it was a riot. 

“Why’d you sneak up behind me?” I demanded, giving him a shove back 
against the wall. 

He shrugged. 

“Well, what are you doing up here, anyway?” I sputtered. 

I could still see those dark eyes staring out at me in the mirror. So creepy! 

“I heard you,” he explained, leaning back against the wall, still grinning. “I 
was awake. I heard you walk past my room. So I followed you.” 

“Well, you shouldn’t be up here,” I snapped. 

“Neither should you,” he snapped back. 

“Go back downstairs and go to bed,” I said. My voice was finally returning 
to normal. I tried to sound as if I meant business. 

But Lefty didn’t move. “Make me,” he said. Another classic argument- 
winner. 

“I mean it,” I insisted. “Go back to bed.” 

“Make me,” he repeated nastily. “I’ll tell Mom and Dad you’re up here,” he 
added. 

I hate being threatened. And he knows it. That’s why he threatens me every 
hour of the day. 

Sometimes I just wish I could pound him. 

But we live in a nonviolent family. 



That’s what Mom and Dad say every time Lefty and I get in a fight. “Break 
it up, you two. We live in a nonviolent family.” 

Sometimes nonviolence can be real frustrating. Know what I mean? 

This was one of those times. But I could see that I wasn’t going to get rid of 
Lefty so easily. He was determined to stay up in the attic with me and see what I 
was doing with the mirror. 

My heart had finally slowed down to normal. I was starting to feel calmer. 
So I decided to stop fighting with him and let him stay. I turned back to the 
mirror. 

Luckily, there wasn’t another pair of eyes in there staring out at me! 

“What are you doing?” Lefty demanded, stepping up behind me, his arms 
still crossed over his chest. 

“Just checking out the mirror,” I told him. 

“You going to go invisible again?” he asked. He was standing right behind 
me, and his breath smelled sour, like lemons. 

I turned and shoved him back a few steps. “Get out of my face,” I said. 
“Your breath stinks.” 

That started another stupid argument, of course. 

I was sorry I’d ever come up here. I should have stayed in bed, I realized. 

Finally, I persuaded him to stand a foot away from me. A major victory. 

Yawning, I turned back to the mirror. I was starting to feel sleepy. Maybe it 
was because of the heat of the attic. Maybe it was because I was tired of arguing 
with my dopey brother. Or maybe it was because it was really late at night, and I 
was tired. 

“I’m going to turn on the light,” I told him, reaching for the chain. “Tell me 
if I go invisible again.” 

“No.” He shoved his way right next to me again. “I want to try it, too.” 

“No way,” I insisted, shoving back. 

“Yes way.” He pushed me hard. 

I pushed back. Then I had a better idea. “How about if we both stand in 
front of the mirror, and I pull the light chain?” 

“Okay. Go ahead.” Standing an inch in front of it, practically nose to nose 
with his reflection, Lefty stiffened until he was standing at attention. 

He looked ridiculous, especially in those awful green pajamas. 

I stepped up beside him. “Here goes nothing,” I said. 

I stretched my hand up, grabbed the light chain, and pulled.

The light on top of the mirror flashed. 

“Ow!” I cried out. The light was so bright, it hurt my eyes. 

Then it quickly dimmed, and my eyes started to adjust. 

I turned to Lefty and started to say something. I don’t remember what it 
was. It completely flew out of my mind when I realized that Lefty was gone. 

“L-Lefty?” I stammered. 

“I’m right here,” he replied. His voice sounded nearby, but I couldn’t see 
him. “Max—where are you?” 

“You can’t see me?” I cried. 

“No,” Lefty said. “No, I can’t.” 

I could smell his sour breath, so I knew he was there. But he was invisible. 
Gone. Out of sight. 

So they weren’t putting me on! Erin, April, and Lefty had been telling the 
truth on Saturday after my birthday party. I really had gone invisible. 

And now I was invisible again, along with my brother. 

“Hey, Max,” his voice sounded tiny, shaky. “This is weird.” 

“Yeah. It’s weird, okay,” I agreed. “You really can’t see me, Lefty?” 

“No. And I can’t see myself,” he said. 

The mirror. I had forgotten to check out the mirror. 

Did I have a reflection? 

I turned and stared into the mirror. The light was pouring down from the top 
of the frame, casting a bright glare over the glass. 

Squinting into the glare, I saw... nothing. 

No me. 

No Lefty. 

Just the reflection of the wall behind us and the open doorway leading to 
the rest of the attic. 

“We—we don’t have reflections,” I said. 

“It’s kinda cool,” Lefty remarked. He grabbed my arm. I jumped in 
surprise. 

“Hey!” I cried. 



It felt creepy to be grabbed by an invisible person. 

I grabbed him back. I tickled his ribs. He started to laugh. 

“We still have our bodies,” I said. “We just can’t see them.” 

He tried to tickle me, but I danced away from him. 

“Hey, Max, where’d you go?” he called, sounding frightened again. 

“Try and find me,” I teased, backing toward the wall. 

“I—I can’t,” he said shakily. “Come back over here, okay?” 

“No way,” I said. “I don’t want to be tickled.” 

“I won’t,” Lefty swore. “I promise.” 

I stepped back in front of the mirror. 

“Are you here?” Lefty asked timidly. 

“Yeah. I’m right beside you. I can smell your bad breath,” I told him. 

And he started to tickle me again. The little liar. 

We wrestled around for a bit. It was just so strange wrestling with someone 
you couldn’t see. 

Finally, I pushed him away. “I wonder if we could go downstairs and still 
be invisible,” I said. “I wonder if we could leave the house like this.” 

“And go spy on people?” Lefty suggested. 

“Yeah,” I said. I yawned. I was starting to feel a little strange. “We could go 
spy on girls and stuff.” 

“Cool,” Lefty replied. 

“Remember that old movie Mom and Dad were watching on TV?” I asked 
him. “About the ghosts who kept appearing and disappearing all the time? They 
had a lot of fun scaring people. You know, playing jokes on them, driving them 
crazy.” 

“But we’re not ghosts,” Lefty replied in a trembling voice. I think the idea 
kind of frightened him. 

It frightened me, too! 

“Could we go back to normal now?” Lefty asked. “I don’t feel right.” 

“Me, either,” I told him. I was feeling very light. Kind of fluttery. Just... 
weird. 

“How can we get back right again?” he asked. 

“Well, the last time, I just pulled the chain. I clicked the light off, and I was 
back. That’s all it took.” 

“Well, do it,” Lefty urged impatiently. “Right now. Okay?” 

“Yeah. Okay.” I started to feel kind of dizzy. Kind of light. As if I could 



float away or something. 

“Hurry,” Lefty said. I could hear him breathing hard. 

I reached up and grabbed the light chain. “No problem,” I told him. “We’ll 
be back in a second.” 

I pulled the chain. 

The light went out. 

But Lefty and I didn’t return.

“Max—I can’t see you!” Lefty whined. 

“I know,” I replied quietly. I felt so frightened. I had chills running down 
my back, chills that wouldn’t stop. “I can’t see you, either.” 

“What happened?” Lefty cried. I could feel him tug at my invisible arm. 

“I—I don’t know,” I stammered. “It worked before. I clicked off the light 
and I was back.” 

I gazed into the mirror. No reflection. Nothing. 

No me. No Lefty. 

I stood there, staring at the spot where our reflections should be, frozen 
with fear. I was glad Lefty couldn’t see me because I wouldn’t want him to see 
how frightened I looked. 

“Try it again, Max,” he whined. “Please. Hurry!” 

“Okay,” I said. “Just try to stay calm, okay?” 

“Stay calm? How?” Lefty wailed. “What if we never get back? What if no 
one can ever see us again?” 

I suddenly felt so sick. My stomach just sort of heaved. 

Get a grip, I told myself. You’ve got to keep it together, Max. For Lefty’s 

sake. 

I stretched up for the light chain, but it seemed to be out of my reach. 

I tried again. Missed. 

And then suddenly, I was back. And so was Lefty. 

We could see each other. And we could see our reflections in the mirror. 

“We’re back!” We both shouted it in unison. 

And then we both fell on the floor, laughing. We were so relieved. So 
happy. 

“Ssshh!” I grabbed Lefty and shoved my hand over his mouth. I just 
remembered it was the middle of the night. “If Mom and Dad catch us up here, 
they’ll kill us,” I warned, whispering. 

“Why did it take so long for us to come back?” Lefty asked, turning serious, 
gazing at his reflection. 

I shrugged. “Beats me.” I thought about it. “Maybe if you stay invisible 



longer, it takes longer for you to get back,” I suggested. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” 

“The first time I went invisible,” I told him, “it was only for a few seconds. 
And I came back instantly, as soon as I clicked off the light. But tonight—” 

“We stayed invisible a lot longer. So it took longer to come back. I get it,” 
Lefty said. 

“You’re not as dumb as you look,” I said, yawning. 

“You are!” he snapped back. 

Feeling totally exhausted, I started to lead the way out of the tiny room, 
motioning for Lefty to follow me. But he hesitated, glancing back at his 
reflection in the mirror. 

“We have to tell Mom and Dad about the mirror,” he whispered 
thoughtfully. 

“No way!” I told him. “No way we’re telling them. If we tell them about it, 
they’ll take it away. They won’t let us use it.” 

He stared at me thoughtfully. “I’m not sure I want to use it,” he said softly. 

“Well, I do,” I said, turning at the doorway to look back at it. “I want to use 
it just one more time.” 

“What for?” Lefty asked, yawning. 

“To scare Zack,” I said, grinning. 

Zack couldn’t come over until Saturday. As soon as he arrived, I wanted to take 
him up to the attic and give him a demonstration of the mirror’s powers. 

Mainly, I wanted to scare the life out of him! 

But Mom insisted that we sit down for lunch first. Canned chicken noodle 
soup and peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. 

I gulped my soup as fast as I could, not bothering to chew the noodles. 
Lefty kept giving me meaningful glances across the table. I could see that he was 
as eager as I was to scare Zack. 

“Where’d you get that haircut?” my mom asked Zack. She walked around 
the table, staring at Zack’s head, frowning. I could tell she hated it. 

“At Quick Cuts,” Zack told her after swallowing a mouthful of peanut 
butter and jelly. “You know. At the mall.” 

We all studied Zack’s haircut. I thought it was kind of cool. The way it was 
buzzed so short on the left, then hung down long on the right. 

“It’s different, all right,” my mom said. 



We all could tell she hated it. But I guess she thought she was covering up 
by calling it different. If I ever came home with a haircut like that, she’d murder 
me! 

“What did your mom say about it?” she asked Zack. 

Zack laughed. “Not much.” 

We all laughed. I kept glancing up at the clock. I was so eager to get 
upstairs. 

“How about some chocolate cupcakes?” Mom asked when we’d finished 
our sandwiches. 

Zack started to say yes, but I interrupted him. “Can we have dessert later? 
I’m kinda full.” 

I pushed back my chair and got up quickly, motioning for Zack to follow 
me. Lefty was already running to the stairs. 

“Hey—where are you going so fast?” Mom called after us, following us 
into the hall. 

“Uh... upstairs... to the attic,” I told her. 

“The attic?” She wrinkled her face, puzzled. “What’s so interesting up 
there?” 

“Uh... just a bunch of old magazines,” I lied. “They’re kind of funny. I 
want to show them to Zack.” That was pretty fast thinking, for me. I’m usually 
not very quick at making up stories. 

Mom stared at me. I don’t think she believed me. But she turned back to the 
kitchen. “Have fun, guys. Don’t get too dirty up there.” 

“We won’t,” I told her. I led Zack up the steep stairs. Lefty was already 
waiting for us in the attic. 

It was about a hundred degrees hotter up there. I started to sweat the second 
I stepped into the room. 

Zack stopped a few feet behind me and looked around. “It’s just a lot of old 
junk. What’s so interesting up here?” he asked. 

“You’ll see,” I said mysteriously. 

“This way,” Lefty called eagerly, running to the little room against the far 
wall. He was so excited, he dropped his softball. It rolled in front of him, and he 
tripped over it and fell facedown on the floor with a thud. 

“I meant to do that!” Lefty joked, climbing up quickly and leaping after the 
ball, which had rolled across the floor. 

“Your brother is made of rubber or something,” Zack laughed. 



“Falling down is his hobby,” I said. “He falls down about a hundred times a 
day.” I wasn’t exaggerating. 

A few seconds later, the three of us were in the hidden room standing in 
front of the mirror. Even though it was a sunny afternoon, the room was as dark 
and shadowy as ever. 

Zack turned from the mirror to me, a bewildered look on his face. “This is 
what you wanted to show me?” 

“Yeah.” I nodded. 

“Since when are you into furniture?” he asked. 

“It’s an interesting mirror, don’t you think?” I asked. 

“No,” he said. “Not too interesting.” 

Lefty laughed. He bounced his softball off the wall and caught it. 

I was deliberately taking my time. Zack was in for the surprise of his life, 
but I wanted to confuse him a little bit first. He was always doing stuff like that 
to me. He always acted as if he knew everything there was to know, and if I were 
good, he’d share a little bit of his knowledge with me. 

Well, now I knew something he didn’t know. I wanted to stretch this 
moment out, make it last. 

But at the same time, I couldn’t wait to watch the look on Zack’s face when 
I disappeared right in front of his eyes. 

“Let’s go outside,” Zack said impatiently. “It’s too hot up here. I brought 
my bike. Why don’t we ride to the playground behind school, see who’s there?” 

“Maybe later,” I replied, grinning at Lefty. I turned to my brother. “Should I 
show Zack our secret or not?” 

Lefty grinned back at me. He shrugged. 

“What secret?” Zack demanded. I knew he couldn’t stand to be left out of 
anything. He couldn’t bear it if anyone had a secret he didn’t know about. 

“What secret?” he repeated when I didn’t answer. 

“Show him,” Lefty said, tossing up the softball. 

I rubbed my chin, pretended to be thinking about it. “Well... okay.” I 
motioned for Zack to stand behind me. 

“You’re going to make funny faces in the mirror?” Zack guessed. He shook 
his head. “Big deal!” 

“No. That’s not the secret,” I told him. I stepped in front of the mirror, 
admiring my reflection, which stared back at me in the glass. 

“Watch!” Lefty urged, stepping up beside Zack. 



“I’m watching. I’m watching,” Zack said impatiently. 

“I’ll bet you I can disappear into thin air,” I told Zack. 

“Yeah. Sure,” he muttered. 

Lefty laughed. 

“How much do you want to bet?” I asked. 

“Two cents,” Zack said. “Is this some kind of trick mirror or something?” 
“Something like that,” I told him. “How about ten dollars? Bet me ten 
dollars?” 

“Huh?” 

“Forget the bet. Just show him,” Lefty said, bouncing up and down 
impatiently. 

“I have a magic kit at home,” Zack said. “I can do over a thousand tricks. 
But it’s kid stuff,” he sneered. 

“You don’t have any tricks like this,” I said confidently. 

“Just get it over with so we can go outside,” he grumbled. 

I stepped into the center of the mirror. “Ta -daa\” I sang myself a short 
fanfare. Then I reached up and grabbed the light chain. 

I pulled it. The lamp above the mirror flashed on, blindingly bright at first, 
then dimming as before. 

And I was gone. 

“Hey!” Zack cried. He stumbled backwards. 

He actually stumbled out of shock! 

Invisible, I turned away from the mirror to enjoy his stunned reaction. 
“Max?” he cried out. His eyes searched the room. 

Lefty was laughing his head off. 

“Max?” Zack sounded really worried. “Max? How’d you do that? Where 
are you?” 

“I’m right here,” I said. 

He jumped at the sound of my voice. Lefty laughed even harder. 

I reached out and took the softball from Lefty’s hand. I glanced at the 
reflection in the mirror. The ball seemed to float in midair. 

“Here. Catch, Zack.” I tossed it at him. 

He was so stunned, he didn’t move. The ball bounced off his chest. “Max? 
How do you do this trick?” he demanded. 

“It isn’t a trick. It’s real,” I said. 

“Hey, wait...” He got a suspicious look on his face. He ran around to the 



back of the mirror. I guess he expected me to be hiding back there. 

He looked very disappointed when he didn’t see me. “Is there a trapdoor or 
something?” he asked. He walked back in front of the mirror, got down on his 
hands and knees, and started searching the floorboards for a trapdoor. 

I leaned over and pulled his T-shirt up over his head. 

“Hey—stop it!” he yelled, climbing angrily to his feet. 

I tickled his stomach. 

“Stop, Max.” He squirmed away, thrashing his arms, trying to hit me. He 
looked really frightened now. He was breathing hard, and his face was bright 
red. 

I pulled his T-shirt up again. 

He jerked it down. “You’re really invisible?” His voice rose up so high, 
only dogs could hear it. “Really?” 

“Good trick, huh?” I said right in his ear. 

He jumped and spun away. “What does it feel like? Does it feel weird?” 

I didn’t answer him. I crept out of the room and picked up a cardboard 
carton just outside the door. I carried it up to the mirror. It looked great. A carton 
floating all by itself. 

“Put it down,” Zack urged. He sounded really scared. “This is really 
freaking me out, Max. Stop it, okay? Come back so I can see you.” 

I wanted to torture him some more, but I could see he was about to lose it. 
Besides, I was starting to feel weird again. Sort of dizzy and lightheaded. And 
the bright light was hurting my eyes, starting to blind me. 

“Okay, I’m coming back,” I announced. “Watch.” 

I leaned against the mirror and reached up for the chain. I suddenly felt very 
tired, very weak. It took all my strength to wrap my hand around the chain. 

I had the strangest sensation that the mirror was pulling me, tugging me 
toward it, holding me down. 

With a determined burst of strength, I pulled the chain. 

The lamp went out. The room darkened. 

“Where are you? I still can’t see you!” Zack cried, his voice revealing 
panic. 

“Just chill,” I told him. “It takes a few seconds. The longer I stay invisible, 
the longer it takes to come back.” And then I added, “I think.” 

Staring into the blank mirror, waiting for my reflection to return, I suddenly 
realized that I didn’t know anything at all about this mirror, about turning 



invisible. About coming back. 

My mind suddenly whirred with all sorts of terrifying questions: 

What made me think that reappearing was automatic? 

What if you could only come back twice? And after the third time you went 
invisible, you stayed invisible? 

What if the mirror was broken? What if it was locked away in this hidden 
room because it didn’t work properly and it made people stay invisible forever? 

What if I never came back? 

No, that can’t be, I told myself. 

But the seconds were ticking by. And my body was still not visible. 

I touched the mirror, rubbing my invisible hand over the smooth, cool glass. 

“Max, what’s taking so long?” Zack asked, his voice trembling. 

“I don’t know,” I told him, sounding as frightened and upset as he did. 

And then suddenly, I was back. 

I was staring at my reflection in the mirror, watching intently, gratefully, as 
a wide smile crossed my face. 

“Ta-daaa\” I sang my triumphant fanfare, turning to my still shaken friend. 
“Here lam!” 

“Wow!” Zack exclaimed, and his mouth remained in a tight O of surprise 
and wonder. “Wow.” 

“I know,” I said, grinning. “Pretty cool, huh?” 

I felt very shaky, kind of trembly all over. My knees felt all weak and 
sweaty. You know the feeling. 

But I ignored it. I wanted to enjoy my moment of glory. It wasn’t often that 
I got to do something that Zack hadn’t already done ten times. 

“Amazing,” Zack said, staring hard at the mirror. “I’ve got to try it!” 

“Well...” I wasn’t so sure I wanted Zack to do it. It was such a big 
responsibility. I mean, what if something went wrong? 

“You’ve got to let me do it!” Zack insisted. 

“Hey—where’s Lefty?” I asked, glancing quickly around the small room. 

“Huh? Lefty?” Zack’s eyes searched, too. 

“I was so busy being invisible, I forgot he was here,” I said. And then I 
called, “Hey, Lefty?” 

No reply. 

“Lefty?” 

Silence. 



I walked quickly around to the back of the mirror. He wasn’t there. Calling 
his name, I made my way to the door and peered out into the attic. 

No sign of him. 

“He was standing right here. In front of the mirror,” Zack said, suddenly 

pale. 

“Lefty?” I called. “Are you here? Can you hear me?” 

Silence. 

“Weird,” Zack said. 

I swallowed hard. My stomach suddenly felt as if I’d swallowed a rock. 

“He was right here. Standing right here,” Zack said in a shrill, frightened 
voice. 

“Well, he’s gone now,” I said, staring at the dark, shadowy reflection of the 
mirror. “Lefty’s gone.”

“Maybe Lefty went invisible, too,” Zack suggested. 

“Then why doesn’t he answer us?” I cried. I tried calling my brother again. 
“Lefty—are you here? Can you hear me?” 

No reply. 

I walked up to the mirror and angrily slapped the frame. “Stupid mirror.” 
“Lefty? Lefty?” Zack had his hands cupped around his mouth like a 
megaphone. He stood at the door to the little room, calling out into the attic. 

“I don’t believe this,” I said weakly. My legs were shaking so much, I 
dropped down onto the floor. 

And then I heard giggling. 

“Huh? Lefty?” I jumped to my feet. 

More giggling. Coming from behind the carton I’d carried into the little 
room. 

I lunged toward the carton just as Lefty popped up from behind it. 
“Gotcha!” he cried, and collapsed over the carton, slapping the floor, laughing 
his head off. 

“Gotcha! Gotcha both!” 

“You little creep!” Zack screamed. 

He and I both pounced on Lefty at the same time. I pulled his arm back 
until he screamed. Zack messed up his hair, then tickled him. 

Lefty was screaming and laughing and squirming and crying all at the same 
time. I gave him a hard punch on the shoulder. “Don’t ever do that again,” I 
shouted angrily. 

Lefty laughed, so I gave him a hard shove and climbed to my feet. 

Zack and I, both breathing hard, both red in the face, glared angrily at Lefty. 
He was rolling around on the floor, covered in dust, still laughing like a lunatic. 
“You scared us to death. You really did!” I exclaimed heatedly. 

“I know,” Lefty replied happily. 

“Let’s beat him up some more,” Zack suggested, balling his hands into tight 

fists. 

“Okay,” I agreed. 



“You’ll have to catch me first!” Lefty cried. He was on his feet in a flash, 
and out the door. 

I chased after him, tripped over a stack of old clothes, and went flying 
headfirst to the floor. “Ow!” I banged my leg hard. The pain shot up through my 
body. 

Pulling myself up slowly, I started after Lefty again. But voices on the attic 
stairway made me stop. 

Erin’s head popped up first. Then April appeared. 

Lefty was sitting on the windowsill at the far end of the attic, red-faced and 
sweaty, catching his breath. 

“Hey, how’s it going?” I called to the two girls, brushing dust off my jeans, 
then straightening my hair with one hand. 

“Your mom said you were here,” Erin explained, looking from Lefty to me. 

“What are you guys doing up here?” April asked. 

“Oh... just hanging out,” I said, casting an angry glance at my brother, who 
stuck his tongue out in reply. 

April picked up an old Life magazine from a stack of yellowed magazines 
and began flipping through it. But the pages crumbled as she looked at them. 
“Yuck,” she said, putting it down. “This stuff is so old.” 

“That’s what attics are for,” I said, starting to feel a little more normal. 
“Whoever heard of keeping new stuff in an attic?” 

“Ha-ha,” Lefty laughed sarcastically. 

“Where’s that mirror?” Erin asked, stepping into the center of the room. 
“The one that made that weird optical illusion last Saturday.” 

“It wasn’t an optical illusion,” I blurted out. I didn’t really feel like messing 
with the mirror anymore. I’d had enough scares for one afternoon. But the words 
just tumbled out of me. 

I can never keep a secret. It’s a real character flaw. 

“What do you mean?” Erin asked, very interested. She walked past me, 
heading to the open doorway of the little room. 

“You mean that wasn’t an optical illusion last week?” April asked, 
following her. 

“No, not really,” I said, glancing at Lefty, who hadn’t budged from the 
windowsill across the large room. “The mirror has strange powers or something. 
It really can turn you invisible.” 

April laughed scornfully. “Yeah. Right,” she said. “And I’m going to fly to 



Mars in a flying saucer tonight after dinner.” 

“Give me a break,” I muttered. I turned my eyes to Erin. “I’m serious.” 

Erin stared back at me, her face filled with doubt. “You’re trying to tell us 
that you’ve gone in that room and become invisible?” 

“I’m not trying to tell you,” I replied heatedly. “I am telling you!” 

April laughed. 

Erin continued to stare at me, studying my face. “You are serious,” she 
decided. 

“It’s a trick mirror,” April told her. “That’s all. That light on top of it is so 
bright, it makes your eyes go weird.” 

“Show us,” Erin said to me. 

“Yeah. Show them!” Lefty exclaimed eagerly. He jumped up from the 
windowsill and started running to the little room. “I’ll go this time! Let me do 
it!” 

“No way,” I said. 

“Let me try it,” Erin volunteered. 

“Hey, do you know who else is here?” I asked the girls, following them to 
the room. “Zack is here.” I called to him. “Hey, Zack. Erin wants to go invisible. 
Think we should let her?” 

I stepped into the room. “Zack?” 

“Where’s he hiding?” Erin asked. 

I uttered a silent gasp. 

The mirror light was on. Zack was gone.

“Oh, no!” I cried. “I don’t believe this!” 

Lefty laughed. “Zack’s invisible,” he told Erin and April. 

“Zack—where are you?” I demanded angrily. 

Suddenly, the softball floated up from Lefty’s hand. “Hey, give that back!” 
Lefty shouted, and grabbed for it. But invisible Zack pulled the ball out of 
Lefty’s reach. 

Erin and April were both gaping at the ball as it floated in midair, their eyes 
bulging, their mouths wide open. 

“Hi, girls,” Zack called in a booming, deep voice that floated from in front 
of the mirror. 

April screamed and grabbed Erin’s arm. 

“Zack, stop kidding around. How long have you been invisible?” I asked. 

“I don’t know.” The ball flew back to Lefty, who dropped it and had to 
chase it out into the attic. 

“How long, Zack?” I repeated. 

“About five minutes, maybe,” he replied. 

“When you chased after Lefty, I turned on the light and went invisible. 
Then I heard you talking to Erin and April.” 

“You’ve been invisible the whole time?” I asked, feeling really nervous and 
upset. 

“Yeah. This is awesome!” he exclaimed. But then his tone grew doubtful. “I 
—I’m starting to feel kinda funny, though, Max.” 

“Funny?” Erin asked, staring at where Zack’s voice seemed to be coming 
from. “What do you mean ‘funny’?” 

“Kinda dizzy,” Zack replied weakly. “Everything’s kind of breaking up. 
You know. Like a bad TV picture. I mean, you’re starting to fade, to seem far 
away.” 

“I’m bringing you back,” I said. And without waiting for Zack to reply, I 
reached up and pulled the light chain. 

The light clicked off. Darkness seemed to roll into the room, filling the 
mirror with gray shadows. 

“Where is he?” April cried. “It didn’t work. He isn’t back.” 



“It takes a while,” I explained. 

“How long?” April asked. 

“I don’t really know,” I said. 

“Why aren’t I back?” Zack asked. He was standing right beside me. I could 
feel his breath on my neck. “I can’t see myself.” He sounded very frightened. 

“Don’t get tense,” I said, forcing myself to sound calm. “You know it takes 
a while. Especially since you stayed invisible so long.” 

“But how long?” Zack wailed. “Shouldn’t I be back by now? You were back 
by now. I remember.” 

“Just stay cool,” I told him, even though my stomach was churning and my 
throat was dry. 

“This is too scary. I hate this!” April moaned. 

“Be patient,” I repeated softly. “Everybody just be patient.” 

We all stared from the spot where we thought Zack was standing to the 
mirror, then back again. 

“Zack, how do you feel?” Erin asked, her voice trembling. 

“Weird,” Zack replied. “Like I’m never coming back.” 

“Don’t say that!” I snapped. 

“But that’s how I feel,” Zack said sadly. “Like I’m never coming back.” 

“Just chill,” I said. “Everybody. Just chill.” 

We stood in silence. Watching. Waiting. 

Waiting. 

I was never so frightened in all my life.

“Do something!” Zack, still invisible, pleaded. “Max—you’ve got to do 
something!” 

“I—I’d better get Mom,” Lefty stammered. He dropped the softball to the 
floor and started to the door. 

“Mom? What could Mom do?” I cried in a panic. 

“But I’d better get somebody !” Lefty declared. 

At that moment, Zack shimmered back into view. “Wow!” He uttered a 
long, breathless sigh of relief and slumped to his knees on the floor. 

“Yaaaay!” Erin cried happily, clapping her hands as we all gathered around 
Zack. 

“How do you feel?” I asked, grabbing his shoulders. I think I wanted to 
know for sure that he was really back. 

“I’m back!” Zack proclaimed, smiling. “That’s all I care about.” 

“That was really scary,” April said quietly, hands shoved into the pockets of 
her white tennis shorts. “I mean, really.” 

“I wasn’t scared,” Zack said, suddenly changing his tune. “I knew there was 
no problem.” 

Do you believe this guy? 

One second, he’s whining and wailing, begging me to do something. 

The next second, he’s pretending he had the time of his life. Mister 
Confident. 

“What did it feel like?” Erin asked, resting one hand on the wooden mirror 
frame. 

“Awesome,” Zack replied. He climbed unsteadily to his feet. “Really. It was 
totally awesome! I want to get invisible again before school on Monday so I can 
go spy in the girls’ locker room!” 

“Zack, you’re a pig!” Erin declared disgustedly. 

“What’s the point of being invisible if you can’t spy on girls?” Zack asked. 

“Are you sure you’re okay?” I asked, genuinely concerned. “You look kind 
of shaky to me.” 

“Well, I started to feel a little strange at the end,” Zack confessed, 
scratching the back of his head. 



“How do you mean?” I asked. 

“Well, like I was being pulled away. Away from the room. Away from you 
guys.” 

“Pulled where?” I demanded. 

He shrugged. “I don’t know. I only know one thing.” A smile began to form 
on his face, and his blue eyes seemed to light up. 

Uh-oh, I thought. 

“I only know one thing,” Zack repeated. 

“What?” I had to ask. 

“I’m the new invisible champ. I stayed invisible longer than you. At least 
five minutes. Longer than anybody.” 

“But I haven’t had a turn!” Erin protested. 

“I don’t want a turn!” April declared. 

“Chicken?” Zack teased her. 

“I think you’re stupid for messing around with this,” April said heatedly. “It 
isn’t a toy, you know. You don’t know anything about it. You don’t know what it 
really does to your body.” 

“I feel fine!” Zack told her, and pounded his chest with both hands like a 
gorilla to prove it. He glanced at the dark mirror. “I’m ready to go back—even 
longer.” 

“I want to get invisible and go outside and play tricks on people,” Lefty 
said enthusiastically. “Can I go next, Max?” 

“I—I don’t think so....” 

I was thinking about what April had said. We really were messing around 
with something that could be dangerous, something we didn’t know anything 
about. 

“Max has to go again,” Zack said, slapping me hard on the back, nearly 
sending me sprawling against the mirror. “To beat my record.” He grinned at me. 
“Unless you’re chicken, too.” 

“I’m not chicken!” I insisted. “I just think—” 

“You’re chicken,” Zack accused, laughing scornfully. He started clucking 
loudly, flapping his arms like a chicken. 

“I’m not chicken. Let me go,” Lefty pleaded. “I can break Zack’s record.” 

“It’s my turn,” Erin insisted. “You guys have all had turns. I haven’t gone 
once yet!” 

“Okay,” I said with a shrug. “You go first, Erin. Then me.” I was glad Erin 



was so eager to do it. I really didn’t feel like getting invisible again just yet. 

To be honest, I felt very fluttery and nervous. 

“Me next!” Lefty insisted. “Me next! Me next!” He started chanting the 
words over and over. 

I clamped my hand over his mouth. “Maybe we should all go downstairs,” I 
suggested. 

“Chicken?” Zack teased. “You’re chickening out?” 

“I don’t know, Zack,” I replied honestly. “I think—” I saw Erin staring at 
me. Was that disappointment on her face? Did Erin think I was a chicken, too? 

“Okay,” I said. “Go ahead, Erin. You go. Then I’ll go. Then Lefty. We’ll all 
beat Zack’s record.” 

Erin and Lefty clapped. April groaned and rolled her eyes. Zack grinned. 

It’s no big deal, I told myself. I’ve done it three times already. It’s perfectly 
painless. And if you just stay cool and wait patiently, you come right back the 
way you were. 

“Does anyone have a watch?” Erin asked. “We need to keep time so I know 
what time I have to beat.” 

I could see that Erin was really into this competition. 

Lefty seemed really excited, too. And of course Zack would compete in 
anything. 

Only April was unhappy about the whole thing. She walked silently to the 
back of the room and sat down on the floor with her back against the wall, her 
arms folded over her knees. 

“Hey, you’re the only one with a watch,” Erin called to April. “So you be 
the timer, okay?” 

April nodded without enthusiasm. She raised her wrist and stared down at 
her watch. “Okay. Get ready.” 

Erin took a deep breath and stepped up to the mirror. She closed her eyes, 
reached up, and tugged the light chain. 

The light came on with a bright flash. Erin disappeared. 

“Oh, wow!” she cried. “This is way cool!” 

“How does it feel?” April called from behind us, her eyes glancing from the 
mirror to her watch. 

“I don’t feel any different at all,” Erin said. “What a great way to lose 
weight!” 

“Fifteen seconds,” April announced. 



Lefty’s hair suddenly stood straight up in the air. “Cut it out, Erin!” he 
shouted, twisting away from her invisible hands. 

We heard Erin laugh from somewhere near Lefty. 

Then we heard her footsteps as she walked out of the room and into the 
attic. We saw an old coat rise up into the air and dance around. After it dropped 
back into its carton, we saw an old magazine fly up and its pages appear to flip 
rapidly. 

“This is so much fun!” Erin called to us. The magazine dropped back onto 
the stack. “I can’t wait to go outside like this and really scare people!” 

“One minute,” April called. She hadn’t moved from her sitting position 
against the wall. 

Erin moved around the attic for a while, making things fly and float. Then 
she returned to the little room to admire herself in the mirror. 

“I’m really invisible!” we heard her exclaim excitedly. “Just like in a movie 
or something!” 

“Yeah. Great special effects!” I said. 

“Three minutes,” April announced. 

Erin continued to enjoy herself until about four minutes had passed. Then 
her voice suddenly changed. She started to sound doubtful, frightened. 

“I—I don’t like this,” she said. “I feel kind of strange.” 

April jumped to her feet and ran up to me. “Bring her back!” she demanded. 
“Hurry!” 

I hesitated. 

“Yes. Bring me back,” Erin said weakly. 

“But you haven’t beaten my record!” Zack declared. “Are you sure—?” 

“Yes. Please. I don’t feel right.” Erin suddenly sounded far away. 

I stepped up to the mirror and pulled the chain. The light clicked off. 

We waited for Erin to return. 

“How do you feel?” I asked. 

“Just... weird,” she replied. She was standing right next to me, but I still 
couldn’t see her. 

It took nearly three minutes for Erin to reappear. Three very tense minutes. 

When she shimmered back into view, she shook herself like a dog shaking 
water off after a bath. Then she grinned at us reassuringly. “I’m okay. It was 
really terrific. Except for the last few seconds.” 

“You didn’t beat my record,” Zack reported happily. “You came so close. 



But you folded. Just like a girl.” 

“Hey—” Erin gave Zack a hard shove. “Stop being such a jerk.” 

“But you only had fifteen seconds to go, and you wimped out!” Zack told 
her. 

“I don’t care,” Erin insisted, frowning angrily at him. “It was really neat. 
I’ll beat your record next time, Zack.” 

“I’m going to be the winner,” Lefty announced. “I’m going to stay invisible 
for a whole day. Maybe two!” 

“Whoa!” I cried. “That might be dangerous, Lefty.” 

“It’s Max’s turn next,” Zack announced. “Unless you want to forfeit.” 

“No way,” I said, glancing at Erin. Reluctantly, I stepped up to the mirror 
and took a deep breath. “Okay, Zack, say good-bye to your record,” I said, trying 
to sound calm and confident. 

I didn’t really want to do it, I admitted to myself. But I didn’t want to look 
like a chicken in front of the others. For one thing, if I did wimp out, I knew that 
Lefty would only remind me of it twenty or thirty times a day for the rest of my 
life. 

So I decided to go ahead and do it. 

“One thing,” I said to Zack. “When I call out ‘ready’, that means I want to 
come back. So when I say ‘ready’, you pull the light chain as fast as you can— 
okay?” 

“Gotcha,” Zack replied, his expression turning serious. “Don’t worry. I’ll 
bring you back instantly.” He snapped his fingers. “Like that. Remember, Max, 
you’ve got to beat five minutes.” 

“Okay. Here goes,” I said, staring at my reflection in the mirror. 

I suddenly had a bad feeling about this. 

A real bad feeling. 

But I reached up and pulled on the light anyway. 



12 


When the glaring light dimmed, I stared hard into the mirror. 

The reflections were bright and clear. Against the back wall, I could see 
April, slumped on the floor, staring intently at her watch. 

Lefty stood near the wall to the right, gaping at the spot where I had stood, 
a silly grin on his face. Zack stood next to him, his arms crossed over his chest, 
also staring into the mirror. Erin leaned against the wall to the left. Her eyes 
were on the light above the mirror frame. 

And where was I? 

Standing right in front of the mirror. Right in the center of it. Staring at their 
reflections. Staring at the spot where my reflection should be. 

Only it wasn’t. 

I felt perfectly normal. 

Experimenting, I kicked the floor. My invisible sneakers made the usual 
scraping sound. 

I grabbed my left arm with my right hand and squeezed it. It felt perfectly 
normal. 

“Hi, everyone,” I said. I sounded the same as ever. 

Only I was invisible. 

I glanced up at the light, casting a yellow rectangle down onto the mirror. 
What was the light’s power? I wondered. 

Did it do something to your molecules? Make them break apart somehow 
so you couldn’t be seen? 

No. That wasn’t a good theory. If your molecules broke up, you’d have to 
feel it. And you wouldn’t be able to kick the floor, or squeeze your arm, or talk. 

So what did the light do? Did it cover you up somehow? Did the light form 
some kind of blanket? A covering that hid you from yourself and everyone else? 

What a mystery! 

I had the feeling I’d never be able to figure it out, never know the answer. 

I turned my eyes away from the light. It was starting to hurt my eyes. 

I closed my eyes, but the bright glare stayed with me. Two white circles that 
refused to dim. 

“How do you feel, Max?” Erin’s voice broke into my thoughts. 



“Okay, I guess,” I said. My voice sounded weird to me, kind of far away. 
“Four minutes, thirty seconds,” April announced. 

“The time went so fast,” I said. 

At least, I thought I said it. I realized I couldn’t tell if I was saying the 
words or just thinking them. 

The bright yellow light glowed even brighter. 

I had the sudden feeling that it was pouring over me, surrounding me. 
Pulling me. 

“I—I feel weird,” I said. 

No response. 

Could they hear me? 

The light folded over me. I felt myself begin to float. 

It was a frightening feeling. As if I were losing control of my body. 
“Ready!” I screamed. “Zack—ready! Can you hear me, Zack?” 

It seemed to take Zack hours to reply. “Okay,” I heard him say. His voice 
sounded so tiny, so far away. 

Miles and miles away. 

“Ready!” I cried. “Ready!” 

“Okay!” Again I heard Zack’s voice. 

But the light was so bright, so blindingly bright. Waves of yellow light 
rolling over me. Ocean waves of light. 

Sweeping me away with it. 

“Pull the chain, Zack!” I screamed. At least, I think I was screaming. 

The light was tugging me so hard, dragging me away, far, far away. 

I knew I would float away. Float forever. 

Unless Zack pulled the chain and brought me back. 

“Pull it! Pull it! Please —pull it!” 

“Okay.” 

I saw Zack step up to the mirror. 

He was blurred in shadows. He stepped through dark shadows, on the other 
side of the light. 

So far away. 

I felt so feather light. 

I could see Zack in the shadows. He jumped up. He grabbed the lamp chain. 
He pulled it down hard. 



The light didn’t click off. It glowed even brighter. 

And then I saw Zack’s face fill with horror. 

He held up his hand. He was trying to show me something. 

He had the chain in his hand. 

“Max, the chain—” he stammered. “It broke off. I can’t turn off the light!” 



13 


Beyond the shimmering wall of yellow light, Zack’s outstretched hand came 
clearly into my view. The dark chain dangled from his hand like a dead snake. 

“It broke off!” he was crying, sounding very alarmed. 

I stared through the light at the chain, feeling myself hovering beside Zack, 
floating, fading. 

Somewhere far in the distance, April was screaming. I couldn’t make out 
her words. 

Lefty stood frozen in the center of the room. It seemed strange to see him 
standing so still. He was always moving, always bouncing, running, falling. But 
now he, too, stood staring at the chain. 

The light shimmered brighter. 

I saw sudden movement. 

Someone was crossing the room. I struggled to focus. 

It was Erin. She was dragging a large cardboard box across the floor. The 
scraping sound it made seemed so far away. 

Feeling myself being pulled away, I struggled to watch her. She pulled the 
box next to the mirror. Then she climbed up onto it. 

I saw her reaching up to the lamp. I saw her staring into the light. 

I wanted to ask her what she was doing, but I was too far away. I was 
floating off. I felt so light, so feather light. 

And as I floated, the yellow light spread over me. It covered me. Pulled me. 

And then with startling suddenness, it was gone. 

And all was darkness. 

“I did it!” Erin proclaimed. 

I heard her explaining to the others. “There was a little bit of chain left up 
there. I pulled it and turned off the light.” Her eyes darted frantically around the 
room, searching for me. “Max—are you okay? Can you hear me?” 

“Yeah. I’m okay,” I replied. 

I felt better. Stronger. Closer. 

I stepped up to the mirror and searched for my reflection. 

“That was scary,” Lefty said behind me. 



“I can feel myself coming back,” I told them. 

“What was his time?” Zack asked April. 

April’s features were tight with worry. Sitting against the wall, she looked 
pale and uncomfortable. “Five forty-eight,” she told Zack. And then quickly 
added, “I really think this stupid competition is a big mistake.” 

“You beat my record!” Zack groaned, turning to where he figured I was 
standing. “I don’t believe it! Almost six minutes!” 

“I’m going for longer than that,” Lefty said, pushing past Zack and stepping 
up to the mirror. 

“We have to fix the chain first,” Erin told him. “It’s too hard to keep 
climbing up on a box to pull that little piece of chain.” 

“I felt pretty strange at the end,” I told them, still waiting to reappear. “The 
light grew brighter and brighter.” 

“Did you feel like you were being pulled away?” Erin asked. 

“Yeah,” I replied. “Like I was fading or something.” 

“That’s how / started to feel,” Erin cried. 

“This is just so dangerous,” April said, shaking her head. 

I popped back. 

My knees buckled and I almost fell to the floor. But I grabbed the mirror 
and held myself up. After a few seconds, my legs felt strong again. I took a few 
steps and regained my balance. 

“What if we couldn’t turn off the light?” April demanded, climbing to her 
feet, brushing the dust off the back of her jeans with both hands. “What if the 
chain completely broke and the light stayed on? What then?” 

I shrugged. “I don’t know.” 

“You broke my record,” Zack said, making a disgusted face. “That means I 
have to have another turn.” 

“No way!” Lefty shouted. “It’s my turn next!” 

“None of you are listening to me!” April cried. “Answer my question. What 
if one of you is invisible and the light won’t go out?” 

“That won’t happen,” Zack told her. He pulled a string from his pocket. 
“Here. I’m going to tie this tightly to the chain.” He climbed up onto the box and 
began to work. “Pull the string. The light goes out,” he told April. “No 
problem.” 

“Which one of us is going to be first to get invisible and then go outside?” 
Erin asked. 



“I want to go to school and terrorize Miss Hawkins,” Lefty said, snickering. 
Miss Hawkins is his social studies teacher. “She’s been terrorizing me ever since 
school started. Wouldn’t it be cool just to sneak up behind her and say, ‘Hi, Miss 
Hawkins’? And she’d turn around and there’d be no one there?” 

“That’s the best you can do?” Erin scoffed. “Lefty, where’s your 
imagination? Don’t you want to make the chalk fly out of her hand, and the 
chalkboard erasers fly across the room, and the wastebasket spill everything out 
on her desk, and her yogurt fly into her face?” 

“Yeah! That’s way cool!” Lefty exclaimed. 

I laughed. It was a funny idea. The four of us could go around, completely 
invisible, doing whatever we wanted. We could wreck the whole school in ten 
minutes! Everyone would be screaming and running out the doors. What a goof! 

“We can’t do it now,” Lefty said, interrupting my thoughts. “Because it’s 
my turn to beat the record.” He turned back to April, who was standing tensely 
by the door, pulling at a strand of her black hair, a worried frown on her face. 
“Ready to time me?” 

“I guess,” she replied, sighing. 

Lefty pushed me out of the way. He stepped in front of the mirror, stared at 
his reflection, and reached for the string. 



14 


“Lefty!” a voice shouted from behind us. “Lefty!” 

Startled by the interruption, I uttered an alarmed cry. Lefty stepped back 
from the mirror. 

“Lefty, tell your brother his friends have to leave! It’s dinnertime. Grammy 
and Poppy are here. They’re eager to see you!” 

It was Mom, calling up from downstairs. 

“Okay, Mom. We’ll be right down!” I shouted quickly. I didn’t want her to 
come up. 

“But that’s not fair!” Lefty whined. “I didn’t get my turn.” 

He stepped back up to the mirror and angrily grabbed for the string again. 

“Put it down,” I told him sternly. “We have to go downstairs. Quick. We 
don’t want Mom or Dad coming up here and seeing the mirror, do we?” 

“Okay, okay,” Lefty grumbled. “But next time, I get to go first.” 

“And then me,” Zack said, heading toward the stairs. “I get a chance to beat 
your record, Max.” 

“Everybody, stop talking about it,” I warned as we all clomped down the 
stairs. “Talk about something else. We don’t want them to overhear anything.” 

“Can we come over tomorrow?” Erin asked. “We could start up the contest 
again.” 

“I’m busy tomorrow,” April said. 

“We can’t do it tomorrow,” I replied. “We’re visiting my cousins in 
Springfield.” I was sorry they’d reminded me. My cousins have this humongous 
sheepdog that likes to run through the mud and then jump on me and wipe its 
hairy paws all over my clothes. Not my idea of a good time. 

“There’s no school on Wednesday,” Zack said. “Teachers’ meetings, I think. 
Maybe we could all come over on Wednesday.” 

“Maybe,” I said. 

We stepped into the hallway. Everyone stopped talking. I could see that my 
grandparents and parents were already sitting at the dining room table. Grammy 
and Poppy liked to eat promptly. If their dinner came one minute late, it made 
them real cranky for the rest of the day. 

I ushered my friends out quickly, reminding them not to tell anyone about 



what we’d been doing. Zack asked again if Wednesday would be okay, and again 
I told him I wasn’t sure. 

Getting invisible was really exciting, really thrilling. But it also made me 
nervous. I wasn’t sure I wanted to do it again so soon. 

“Please!” Zack begged. He couldn’t wait to get invisible again and beat my 
record. He couldn’t stand it that he wasn’t the champ. 

I closed the front door behind them and hurried to the dining room to greet 
my grandparents. They were already slurping their soup when I came in. 

“Hi, Grammy. Hi, Poppy.” I walked around the table and gave them each a 
kiss on the cheek. Grammy smelled of oranges. Her cheek felt soft and mushy. 

Grammy and Poppy are the names I gave them when I was a kid. It’s really 
embarrassing to call them that now, but I still do. I don’t have much choice. 
They even call each other Grammy and Poppy! 

They look alike, almost like brother and sister. I guess that’s what happens 
when you’ve been married a hundred years. They both have long, thin faces and 
short white hair. They both wear thick glasses with silver wire frames. They’re 
both really skinny. And they both have sad eyes and sad expressions. 

I didn’t feel like sitting there at dinner and making small talk with them 
today. I was still really pumped about what we’d been doing all afternoon. 

Being invisible was just so weird and exciting. 

I wanted to be by myself and think about it. You know. Try to relive it, 
relive what it felt like. 

A lot of times after I’ve done something really exciting or interesting, I like 
to go up to my room, lie down on my bed, and just think about it. Analyze it. 
Tear it apart. 

Dad says I have a very scientific mind. I guess he’s right. 

I walked over to my place at the table. 

“You’re looking much shorter,” Poppy said, wiping his mouth with his cloth 
napkin. That was one of his standard jokes. He said it every time he saw me. 

I forced a laugh and sat down. 

“Your soup must be ice cold by now,” Grammy said, clicking her tongue. 
“Nothing I hate more than cold soup. I mean, what’s the point of having soup if 
it isn’t steaming hot?” 

“It tastes okay,” I said, taking a spoonful. 

“We had some delicious cold soup last summer,” Poppy said. He loved to 
contradict Grammy and start arguments with her. “Strawberry soup, remember? 



You wouldn’t want that hot, would you?” 

“It wasn’t strawberry,” Grammy told him, frowning. “It wasn’t even soup. 
It was some kind of fancy yogurt.” 

“No, it wasn’t,” Poppy insisted. “It was definitely cold soup.” 

“You’re wrong, as usual,” Grammy snapped. 

This could get ugly, I thought. “What kind of soup is this?” I asked, trying 
to stop their arguing. 

“Chicken noodle,” Mom answered quickly. “Didn’t you recognize it?” 

“Poppy and I had soup a few weeks ago that we couldn’t recognize,” my 
grandmother said, shaking her head. “I had to ask the waiter what it was. It 
didn’t look like what we’d ordered at all. Some kind of potato-leek soup, wasn’t 
it, Poppy?” 

Poppy took a long time swallowing some noodles. “No. Tomato,” he 
answered. 

“Where’s your brother?” Dad asked, staring at the empty chair next to me. 

“Huh?” I reacted with surprise. I had been so busy listening to my 
grandparents’ silly soup arguments, I had forgotten all about Lefty. 

“His soup is getting cold,” Poppy said. 

“You’ll have to heat it up for him,” Grammy said, tsk-tsking again. 

“So where is he?” Dad asked. 

I shrugged. “He was right behind me,” I said. I turned toward the dining 
room doorway and shouted, “Lefty! Lef-teeeee!” 

“Don’t shout at the table,” Mom scolded. “Get up and go find him.” 

“Is there any more soup?” Poppy asked. “I didn’t really get enough.” 

I put my napkin down and started to get up. But before I was out of my 
chair, I saw Lefty’s soup bowl rise up into the air. 

Oh, no! I thought. 

I knew instantly what was happening. 

My idiot brother had made himself invisible, and now he thought he was 
being funny, trying to scare the daylights out of everyone at the table. 

The soup bowl floated up over Lefty’s place. 

I stood up and lunged for it and pulled it down as fast as I could. 

“Get out!” I whispered loudly to Lefty. 

“What did you say?” my mom asked, gaping at me. 

“I said I’m getting out and going to find Lefty,” I told her, thinking quickly. 

“Get out—now!” I whispered to Lefty. 



“Stop talking about finding him. Just go do it,” my mom said impatiently. 

I stood up just as my dumb invisible brother raised his water glass. The 
glass floated up over the table. 

I gasped and grabbed for it. 

But I grabbed too hard. I jerked the glass, and water spilled all over the 
table. 

“Hey!” Mom screamed. 

I pulled the glass down to its place. 

Then I looked up. Dad was glaring at me, his eyes burning angrily into 
mine. 

He knows, I thought, a heavy feeling of dread sweeping over me. 

He saw what just happened, and he knows. 

Lefty has spoiled it for everyone. 



15 


Dad glared angrily across the table at me. 

I waited for him to say, “Max, why is your brother invisible?” But instead, 
he yelled, “Stop fooling around, Max. We don’t appreciate your comedy act. Just 
get up and find your brother.” 

I was so relieved. Dad hadn’t realized what was really happening, after all. 
He thought I was just goofing. 

“Is there seconds on the soup?” I heard Poppy ask again as I gratefully 
pushed away from the table and hurried out of the dining room. 

“You’ve had enough,” Grammy scolded. 

“No, I haven’t!” 

I made my way quickly through the living room, taking long strides, 
climbed to the second floor, and stopped in the hallway at the door to the attic 
stairs. “Lefty?” I whispered. “I hope you followed me.” 

“I’m here,” Lefty whispered back. I couldn’t see him, of course, but he was 
right beside me. 

“What’s the big idea?” I demanded angrily. I wasn’t angry. I was furious. 
“Are you trying to win the stupid championship?” 

Lefty didn’t care that I was upset. He started to giggle. 

“Shut up!” I whispered. “Just shut up! You really are a dork!” 

I clicked on the attic light and clomped angrily up the stairs. I could hear his 
sneakers clomping up behind mine. 

He was still giggling at the top of the stairs. “I win!” he declared. I felt a 
hand slap me hard on the back. 

“Stop it, jerk!” I screamed, storming into the little room that housed the 
mirror. “Don’t you realize you nearly spoiled it for everybody?” 

“But I win!” he repeated gleefully. 

The lamp over the mirror was shining brightly, the reflection glaring sun- 
yellow in the mirror. 

I really couldn’t believe Lefty. He was usually a pretty selfish kid. But not 
this selfish! 

“Don’t you realize the trouble you could have gotten us into?” I cried. 

“I win! I win!” he chanted. 



“Why? How long have you been invisible?” I asked. I stepped up to the 
mirror and pulled the string. The light went out. The glare remained in my eyes. 

“Ever since you guys went downstairs,” Lefty, still invisible, bragged. 

“That’s almost ten minutes!” I exclaimed. 

“I’m the champ!” Lefty proclaimed. 

I stared into the mirror, waiting for him to reappear. 

“The stupidity champ,” I repeated. “This was the dumbest thing you’ve 
ever done.” 

He didn’t say anything. Linally, he asked in a quiet voice, “Why is it taking 
so long for me to come back?” 

Before I could answer, I heard Dad calling from downstairs: “Max? Are 
you two up there?” 

“Yeah. We’ll be right down,” I shouted. 

“What are you two doing up there?” Dad demanded. I heard him start to 
climb the stairs. 

I ran to the top of the stairs to head him off. “Sorry, Dad,” I said. “We’re 
coming.” 

Dad stared up at me in the stairwell. “What on earth is so interesting up 
there?” 

“Just a lot of old stuff,” I muttered. “Nothing, really.” 

Lefty appeared behind me, looking like his old self. Dad disappeared back 
to the dining room. Lefty and I started down the stairs. 

“Wow, that was awesome !” Lefty exclaimed. 

“Didn’t you start to feel weird after a while?” I asked him, whispering even 
though we were alone. 

“No.” He shook his head. “I felt fine. It was really awesome ! You should 
have seen the look on your face when I made the soup bowl float up in the air!” 
He started giggling again, that high-pitched giggle of his that I hate. 

“Listen, Lefty,” I warned, stopping at the bottom of the stairs, blocking his 
way to the hallway. “Getting invisible is fun, but it could be dangerous. You—” 

“It’s awesome!” he repeated. “And I’m the new champ.” 

“Listen to me,” I said heatedly, grabbing him by the shoulders. “Just listen. 
You’ve got to promise me that you won’t go up there and get invisible by 
yourself again. I mean it. You’ve got to wait till someone else is around. 
Promise?” I squeezed his shoulders hard. 

“Okay, okay,” he said, trying to squirm away. “I promise.” 



I looked down. He had his fingers crossed on both hands. 


Erin called me later that night. It was about eleven. I was in my pajamas, reading 
a book in bed, thinking about going downstairs and begging my parents to let me 
stay up and watch Saturday Night Live. 

Erin sounded really excited. She didn’t even say hello. Just started talking a 
mile a minute in that squeaky mouse voice, so fast I had trouble understanding 
her. 

“What about the science fair?” I asked, holding the phone away from my 
ear, hoping that would help me understand her better. 

“The winning project,” Erin said breathlessly. “The prize is a silver trophy 
and a gift certificate at Video World. Remember?” 

“Yeah. So?” I still wasn’t following her. I think I was sleepier than I’d 
thought. It had been a nervous, tiring day, after all. 

“Well, what if you brought the mirror to school?” Erin asked excitedly. 
“You know. I would make you go invisible. Then I’d bring you back, and I’d get 
invisible. That could be our project.” 

“But, Erin—” I started to protest. 

“We’d win!” she interrupted. “We’d have to win! I mean, what else could 
beat it? We’d win first prize. And we’d be famous!” 

“Whoa!” I cried. “Famous?” 

“Of course. Famous!” she exclaimed. “Our picture would be in People 
magazine and everything!” 

“Erin, I’m not so sure about this,” I said softly, thinking hard. 

“Huh? Not so sure about what?” 

“Not so sure I want to be famous,” I replied. “I mean, I really don’t know if 
I want the whole world to know about the mirror.” 

“Why not?” she demanded impatiently. “Everyone wants to be famous. And 
rich.” 

“But they’ll take away the mirror,” I explained. “It’s an amazing thing, Erin. 
I mean, is it magic? Is it electronic? Is it someone’s invention? Whatever it is, 
it’s unbelievable! And they’re not going to let a kid keep it.” 

“But it’s yours\” she insisted. 

“They’ll take it away to study it. Scientists will want it. Government guys 
will want it. Army guys. They’ll probably want to use it to make the army 
invisible or something.” 



“Scary,” Erin mumbled thoughtfully. 

“Yeah. Scary,” I said. “So I don’t know. I’ve got to think about this. A lot. 
In the meantime, it’s got to be a secret.” 

“Yeah, I guess,” she said doubtfully. “But think about the science fair, Max. 
We could win the prize. We really could.” 

“I’ll think about it,” I told her. 

I haven’t thought about anything else! I realized. 

“April wants to try it,” she said. 

“Huh?” 

“I convinced her. I told her it didn’t hurt or anything. So she wants to try it 
on Wednesday. We are going to do it on Wednesday, aren’t we, Max?” 

“I guess,” I replied reluctantly. “Since everyone wants to.” 

“Great!” she exclaimed. “I think I’ll beat your record.” 

“The new record is ten minutes,” I informed her. I explained about Lefty 
and his dinnertime adventure. 

“Your brother is really a nut,” Erin remarked. 

I agreed with her, then said good night. 

I couldn’t get to sleep that night. I tried sleeping on one side, then the other. 
I tried counting sheep. Everything. 

I knew I was sleepy. But my heart was racing. I just couldn’t get 
comfortable. I stared up at the ceiling, thinking about the mirror in the little room 
above me. 

It was nearly three in the morning when I crept barefoot out of my room, 
wide awake, and headed up to the attic. As before, I leaned heavily on the 
banister as I climbed, trying to keep the wooden stairs from their usual 
symphony of creaks and groans. 

In my hurry to get to the little room, I stubbed my toe on the corner of a 
wooden crate. 

“Ow!” I screamed as quietly as possible. I wanted to hop up and down, but 
I forced myself to stand still, and waited for the pain to fade. 

As soon as I could walk again, I made my way into the little room. I pulled 
a carton in front of the mirror and sat down on it. 

My toe still throbbed, but I tried to ignore it. I stared at my dark reflection 
in the mirror, studying my hair first, of course. It was totally messed up, but I 
really didn’t care. 

Then I peered beyond my reflection, behind it. I guess I was trying to look 



deep into the glass. I don’t really know what I was doing or why I was up there. 

I was so tired and pumped up at the same time, so curious and confused, 
sleepy and nervous. 

I ran a hand along the glass, surprised again at how cool it felt in the hot, 
nearly airless little room. I pushed my open hand against the glass, then pulled it 
away. It left no handprint. 

I moved my hand to the wooden frame, once again rubbing the smooth 
wood. I stood up and slowly walked around to the back of the mirror. It was too 
dark back here to really examine it carefully. But there wasn’t anything to 
examine. The back of the frame was smooth, plain, and uninteresting. 

I came back around to the front and gazed up at the light. It looked like an 
ordinary lamp. Nothing at all special about it. The bulb was an odd shape, long 
and very thin. But it looked like an ordinary light bulb. 

Sitting back down on the carton, I rested my head in my hands and stared 
drowsily into the mirror. I yawned silently. 

I knew I should go back downstairs and go to sleep. Mom and Dad were 
going to wake us up early the next morning to drive to Springfield. 

But something was holding me there. 

My curiosity, I guess. 

I don’t know how long I sat there, still as a statue, watching my own 
unmoving reflection. It may have been just a minute or two. Or it might have 
been half an hour. 

But after a while, as I stared into the mirror, the reflection seemed to lose its 
sharpness. Now I found myself staring at vague shapes, blurred colors, 
deepening shadows. 

And then I heard the soft whisper. 

“Maaaaaaaax. ” 

Like the wind through the trees. The hushed shaking of leaves. 

Not a voice at all. Not even a whisper. 

Just the hint of a whisper. 

“Maaaaaaaaax. ” 

At first, I thought it was inside my own head. 

So faint. So soft. But so near. 

I held my breath, listened hard. 

Silence now. 

So it was inside my head, I told myself. I was imagining it. 



I took a deep breath, let it out slowly. 

“Maaaaax. ” 

Again, the whisper. 

Louder this time. Sad, somehow. Almost a plea. A call for help. From far, 
far away. 

“Maaaaaaaax. ” 

I raised my hands to my ears. Was I trying to shut it out? To see if I could 
make it go away? 

Inside the mirror, the dark reflected shapes shifted slowly. I stared back at 
myself, my expression tense, frightened. I realized I was chilled from head to 
foot. My whole body shivered from the cold. 

“Maaaaax. ” 

The whisper, I realized, was coming from the mirror. 

From my own reflection? From somewhere behind my reflection? 

I leapt to my feet, turned away, and ran. My bare feet slapped against the 
hardwood floor. I plunged down the stairs, flew across the hall, dived into my 
bed. 

I shut my eyes tight and prayed the frightening whisper wouldn’t follow 


me. 



16 


I pulled the covers up to my chin. I felt so cold. My entire body was trembling. 

I was breathing hard, gripping the top of the blanket with both hands, 
waiting, listening. 

Would the whispers follow me into my room? Were they real, or only in my 
head? 

Who was calling to me, whispering my name in that sad, desperate voice? 

Suddenly I heard panting louder than mine. I felt hot breath on my face. 
Sour-smelling and moist. 

It reached for me. It grabbed my face. 

I opened my eyes in terror. 

“Whitey!” I cried. 

The dumb dog was standing on his hind paws, leaning over the blanket, 
furiously licking my face. 

“Whitey, good dog!” I cried, laughing. His scratchy tongue tickled. I was 
never so glad to see him. 

I hugged him and pulled him up into the bed. He whimpered excitedly. His 
tail was wagging like crazy. 

“Whitey, what’s got you so worked up?” I asked, hugging him. “Do you 
hear voices, too?” 

He uttered a low bark, as if answering the question. Then he hopped off the 
bed and shook himself. He turned three times in a tight circle, making a place for 
himself on the carpet, and lay down, yawning loudly. 

“You’re definitely weird tonight,” I said. He curled himself into a tight ball 
and chewed softly on his tail. 

Accompanied by the dog’s gentle snores, I eventually drifted into a restless 
sleep. 

When I awoke, the morning sky outside my bedroom window was still 
gray. The window was open just a crack, and the curtains were swaying in a 
strong breeze. 

I sat up quickly, instantly alert. I have to stop going up to the attic, I 
thought. 

I have to forget about the stupid mirror. 



I stood up and stretched. I’ve got to stop. And I’ve got to get everyone else 
to stop. 

I thought of the whispered cry from the night before. The dry, sad voice, 
whispering my name. 

“Max!” 

The voice from outside my room startled me out of my chilling thoughts. 

“Max—time to wake up! We’re going to Springfield, remember?” It was 
my mom out in the hallway. “Hurry. Breakfast is on the table.” 

“I’m already up!” I shouted. “I’ll be down in a minute.” 

I heard her footsteps going down the stairs. Then I heard Whitey downstairs 
barking at the door to be let out. 

I stretched again. 

“Whoa!” I cried out as my closet door swung open. 

A red Gap T-shirt rose up off the top shelf and began to float across the 
room. 

I heard giggling. Familiar giggling. 

The T-shirt danced in front of me. 

“Lefty, you’re ridiculous!” I yelled angrily. I swiped at the T-shirt, but it 
danced out of my reach. “You promised you wouldn’t do this again!” 

“I had my fingers crossed,” he said, giggling. 

“I don’t care!” I cried. I lunged forward and grabbed the shirt. “You’ve got 
to stop. I mean it.” 

“I just wanted to surprise you,” he said, pretending his feelings were hurt. A 
pair of jeans floated up from the closet shelf and began to parade back and forth 
in front of me. 

“Lefty, I’m going to murder you!” I shouted. Then I lowered my voice, 
remembering that Mom and Dad might hear. “Put that down—now. Go upstairs 
and turn off the mirror light. Hurry!” 

I shook my fist at where the jeans were marching. I was so angry. 

Why did he have to be so dumb? Didn’t he realize that this wasn’t just a 
game? 

Suddenly, the jeans collapsed in a heap on the carpet. 

“Lefty, toss them to me,” I instructed him. “Then get upstairs and get 
yourself visible again.” 

Silence. 

The jeans didn’t move. 



“Lefty—don’t fool around,” I snapped, feeling a stab of dread in the pit of 
my stomach. “Toss me the jeans and get out of here.” 

No reply. 

The jeans remained crumpled on the carpet. 

“Stop this stupid game!” I screamed. “You’re not funny! So just stop it. 
Really. You’re scaring me!” 

I knew that’s what he wanted to hear. Once I admitted that he was scaring 
me, I was sure he’d giggle and go do as I said. 

But no. The room was still silent. The curtains fluttered toward me, then 
pulled back with a gentle rustling sound. The jeans lay crumpled on the carpet. 

“Lefty? Hey, Lefty?” I called, my voice trembling. No reply. 

“Lefty? Are you here?” No. Lefty was gone. 



17 


“Lefty?” My voice came out weak and trembling. 

He wasn’t there. It wasn’t a game. He was gone. 

Without thinking, I ran out of my room, down the hall, and up the stairs to 
the attic. My bare feet pounded on the steep wooden steps. My heart was 
pounding even louder. 

As I stepped into the heat of the attic, a wave of fear swept over me. 

What if Lefty had disappeared forever ? 

With a frightened cry, I lunged into the tiny room. 

The bright light reflected in the mirror shone into my eyes. 

Shielding my eyes with one hand, I made my way to the mirror and pulled 
the string. The light went out immediately. 

“Lefty?” I called anxiously. 

No reply. 

“Lefty? Are you up here? Can you hear me?” 

Fear clogged my throat. I was panting loudly, barely able to speak. 

“Lefty?” 

“Hi, Max. I’m here.” My brother’s voice came from right beside me. 

I was so happy to hear it, I turned and gave him a hug, even though I 
couldn’t see him. 

“I’m okay,” he said, startled by my emotion. “Really, Max. I’m okay.” 

It took a few minutes for him to reappear. 

“What happened?” I asked, checking him out, looking him up and down as 
if I hadn’t seen him for months. “You were clowning around in my room. Then 
you were gone.” 

“I’m fine,” he insisted with a shrug. 

“But where did you go?” I demanded. 

“Up here,” he repeated. 

“But Lefty—” Something about him looked different. I couldn’t quite put 
my finger on it. But staring at his face, I was sure that something was weird. 

“Stop staring at me like that, Max.” He shoved me away. “I’m fine. Really.” 
He started dancing away from me, heading to the stairs. 



“But, Lefty—” I followed him out of the room. 

“No more questions. Okay? I’m all right.” 

“Stay away from the mirror,” I said sternly. “Do you hear me?” 

He started down the stairs. 

“I mean it, Lefty. Don’t get invisible again.” 

“Okay, okay,” he snapped. “I won’t do it anymore.” 

I checked to make sure his fingers weren’t crossed. This time they weren’t. 

Mom was waiting for us in the hall. “So there you are,” she said 
impatiently. “Max, you’re not dressed!” 

“I’ll hurry,” I told her, and bolted into my room. 

“Lefty, what did you do to your hair?” I heard Mom ask my brother. “Did 
you brush it differently or something?” 

“No,” I heard Lefty reply. “It’s the same, Mom. Really. Maybe your eyes 
are different.” 

“Stop being such a smart mouth and get downstairs,” Mom told him. 

Something was definitely weird about Lefty. Mom had noticed it, too. But I 
couldn’t figure out what. 

As I picked my jeans up off the floor and pulled them on, I started to feel a 
little better. I had been so frightened, frightened that something terrible had 
happened to my brother. Frightened that he’d disappeared for good, and I’d 
never see him again. 

All because of that stupid mirror. 

All because it was such a thrill to get invisible. 

I suddenly thought about Erin, April, and Zack. 

They were so excited about Wednesday. About the big competition. Even 
April was going to get invisible this time. 

No, I thought. 

I have to call them. I have to tell them. 

I’ve really made up my mind. 

No more mirror. No more getting invisible. 

I’ll call all three of them when I get back from Springfield. And I’ll tell 
them the competition is cancelled. 

I sat down on my bed to tie my sneakers. 

Whew, I thought. That’s a load off my mind. 

And it was. Having decided not to use the mirror ever again made me feel 
much, much better. All of my fear seemed to float away. 



Little did I know that the most frightening time was still to come. 



18 


Imagine my surprise when Zack, Erin, and April showed up at my front door on 
Wednesday morning. 

“I told you guys the competition is off,” I sputtered, staring at them in 
astonishment through the screen door. 

“But Lefty called us,” Erin replied. “He said you changed your mind.” The 
other two agreed. 

My mouth dropped open to my knees. “Lefty?” 

They nodded. “He called us yesterday,” April said. 

“But Lefty isn’t even here this morning,” I told them as they marched into 
the house. “He’s at the playground playing softball with some of his friends.” 

“Who’s here?” my mom called. She came walking into the hallway, drying 
her hands on a dish towel. She recognized my friends, then turned to me, a 
bewildered look on her face. “Max, I thought you were going to help me down 
in the basement. I didn’t know you’d made plans with Zack, Erin, and April.” 

“I didn’t,” I replied weakly. “Lefty—” 

“We just dropped by,” Zack told Mom, coming to my rescue. 

“If you’re busy, Max, we can go,” Erin added. 

“No, that’s okay,” Mom told them. “Max was complaining about how 
boring it would be to help me. It’s good you three showed up.” 

She disappeared back into the kitchen. As soon as she was gone, my three 
friends practically pounced on me. 

“Upstairs!” Zack cried eagerly, pointing to the stairs. 

“Let’s get invisible!” Erin whispered. 

“I get to go first since I’ve never gone,” April said. 

I tried to argue with them, but I was outnumbered and outvoted. “Okay, 
okay,” I reluctantly agreed. I started to follow them up the stairs when I heard 
scratching noises at the door. 

I recognized the sound. It was Whitey, back from his morning walk. I 
pushed open the screen door and he trotted in, wagging his tail. 

The dumb dog had some burrs stuck to his tail. I chased him into the 
kitchen and managed to get him to stand still long enough to pull them off. Then 
I hurried up to the attic to join my friends. 



By the time I got up there, April was already standing in front of the mirror, 
and Zack was standing beside her, ready to pull the light on. 

“Whoa!” I called. 

They turned to look at me. I could see that April had a frightened 
expression on her face. “I have to do this right away. Or else I might wimp out,” 
she explained. 

“I just think we should get the rules straight first,” I said sternly. “This 
mirror really isn’t a toy, and—” 

“We know, we know,” Zack interrupted, grinning. “Come on, Max. No 
lectures today, okay? We know you’re nervous because you’re going to lose. But 
that’s no reason—” 

“I don’t want to compete,” April said nervously. “I just want to see what it’s 
like to be invisible. For just a minute. Then I want to come back.” 

“Well, I’m going for the world’s record,” Zack boasted, leaning against the 
mirror frame. 

“Me, too,” Erin said. 

“I really don’t think it’s a good idea,” I told them, staring at my reflection in 
the mirror. “We should just get invisible for a short time. It’s too dangerous to 

“What a wimp!” Zack declared, shaking his head. 

“We’ll be careful, Max,” Erin said. 

“I just have a really bad feeling,” I confessed. My hair was standing up in 
the back. I stepped closer to the mirror to see better, and smoothed it down with 
my hand. 

“I think we should all get invisible at the same time,” Zack said to me, his 
blue eyes lighting up with excitement. “Then we could go to the playground and 
scare your brother to death!” 

Everyone laughed except April. “I just want to try it for a minute,” she 
insisted. “That’s all.” 

“First we compete,” Erin told Zack. “Then we go out and scare people.” 

“Yeah! All rightl” Zack exclaimed. 

I decided to give up. There was no sense in trying to reason with Zack and 
Erin. They were too psyched for this competition. “Okay, let’s get it over with,” I 
told them. 

“But first I go,” April said, turning back to the mirror. 

Zack reached up for the string again. “Ready? On three,” he said. 



I turned to the door as Whitey came sniffing his way in, his nose lowered to 
the floor, his tail straight out behind him. 

“Whitey, what are you doing up here?” I asked. 

He ignored me and continued sniffing furiously. 

“One... two...” Zack started. 

“When I say ‘ready’, bring me back. Okay?” April asked, standing stiffly, 
staring straight ahead into the mirror. “No jokes or anything, Zack.” 

“No jokes,” Zack replied seriously. “As soon as you want to come back, I’ll 
turn off the light.” 

“Good,” April replied softly. 

Zack began his count again. “One... two... three!” 

As he said three and pulled the string, Whitey stepped up beside April. 

The light flashed on. 

“Whitey!” I screamed. “Stop!” 

But it was too late. 

With a yelp of surprise, the dog vanished along with April. 



19 


“The dog!” Erin screamed. 

“Hey—I’m gone! I’m invisible!” April exclaimed at the same time. 

I could hear Whitey whimpering. He sounded really frightened. 

“Pull the string!” I shouted to Zack. 

“Not yet!” April protested. 

“Pull it!” I insisted. 

Zack pulled the string. The light went out. April reappeared first, with an 
angry expression on her face. 

Whitey reappeared, and fell down. He jumped up quickly, but his legs were 
all wobbly. 

He looked so funny, we all started to laugh. 

“What’s going on up there?” My mom’s voice from the stairwell startled us 
into instant silence. “What are you doing?” 

“Nothing, Mom,” I answered quickly, signalling for my friends to remain 
silent. “Just hanging out.” 

“I don’t understand what’s so interesting up there in that dusty old attic,” 
she called up. 

I crossed my fingers, hoping she wouldn’t come upstairs to find out. 

“We just like it up here,” I replied. Pretty lame, but it was the only thing I 
could think of to say. 

Whitey, having recovered his balance, went running to the stairs. I heard the 
dog’s toenails click on the wooden stairs as he went down to join my mom. 

“That wasn’t fair,” April complained after Mom and Whitey were gone. “I 
didn’t get any time.” 

“I think we should get out of here,” I pleaded. “You see how unpredictable 
it is. You never know what’s going to happen.” 

“That’s sort of the fun of it,” Erin insisted. 

“I want another turn,” April said. 

We argued for about ten minutes. Once again, I lost. 

It was time to start the competition. Erin was going first. 

“Ten minutes is the time to beat,” Zack instmcted her. 



“No problem,” Erin said, making funny faces at herself in the mirror. “Ten 
minutes is too easy.” 

April had resumed her position, sitting on the floor with her back against 
the wall, studying her watch. We had agreed that she would take another turn 
after the competition was over. 

After it was over... 

Standing there watching Erin get ready, I wished it were over already. I felt 
cold all over. I had a heavy feeling of dread weighing me down. 

Please, please, I thought to myself, let everything go okay. 

Zack pulled the string. 

Erin disappeared in the flash of light. 

April studied her watch. 

Zack took a step back from the mirror and crossed his arms in front of his 
chest. His eyes glowed with excitement. 

“How do I look?” Erin teased. 

“You never looked better,” Zack joked. 

“I like what you did with your hair,” April teased, glancing up from the 
watch. 

Even April was joking and having a good time. Why couldn’t I relax, too? 
Why was I suddenly so frightened? 

“You feel okay?” I asked Erin. The words nearly caught in my throat. 

“Fine,” Erin replied. 

I could hear her footsteps as she walked around the room. 

“If you start to feel weird, just say ‘ready’, and Zack’ll pull the string,” I 

said. 

“I know,” she replied impatiently. “But I won’t be ready to come back until 
I break the record.” 

“I’m going next,” Zack told Erin, arms still crossed in front of him. “So 
your record won’t last for long.” 

Suddenly Zack’s arms uncrossed. His hands flew wildly up in the air, and 
he began slapping his face with both hands. 

“Ow! Cut it out, Erin!” he yelled, trying to squirm away. “Let go!” 

We heard Erin laugh as Zack slapped himself a few more times, then finally 
managed to wrestle out of her grip. 

“One minute,” April announced from behind us. 

“Ow! You hurt me!” Zack said, scowling and rubbing his red cheeks. 



Erin laughed again. 

“You still feel okay?” I asked, glancing into the mirror. 

“Fine. Stop worrying, Max,” Erin scolded. 

My T-shirt suddenly pulled up over my head. Erin laughed. 

“Give me a break!” I cried, spinning away. 

“Two minutes,” April announced. 

I heard the attic stairs creaking. A few seconds later, Whitey poked his head 
in. This time, he stopped in the doorway and peered into the room without 
entering. 

“Go back downstairs, boy,” I told him. “Go down.” 

He stared back at me as if considering my request. But he didn’t budge 
from the doorway. 

I didn’t want to take another chance of him getting too close to the mirror. 
So I grabbed him by the collar and guided him to the stairs. Then it took a while 
for the dumb dog to get the idea that he was supposed to go down the stairs! 

When I returned to the little room, April had just called out four minutes. 
Zack was pacing impatiently back and forth in front of the mirror. I guess he 
couldn’t wait for it to be his turn. 

I found myself thinking about Lefty. Lefty knew I had called everyone and 
canceled the competition. So why had he called Zack, Erin, and April and told 
them it was back on? 

Just one of his practical jokes, I decided. 

I’d have to find a way to pay him back for this. 

Something really evil... 

“Eight minutes,” April said, stretching. 

“Pretty good,” Zack told Erin. “Sure you don’t want to quit now? There’s 
no way you can win. Why not save everyone the time?” 

“Do you still feel okay?” I asked anxiously. 

No reply. 

“Erin?” I called, searching around as if I had a chance of spotting her. “You 
feel okay?” 

No reply. 

“Erin—don’t mess around. It’s not funny!” I cried. 

“Yeah. Answer us!” Zack demanded. 

Still no reply. 

Glancing into the mirror, I saw April’s reflection, caught her horrified 



expression. “Erin’s gone,” she uttered, her voice a frightened whisper. 



20 


“Erin—where are you?” I shouted. 

When she didn’t reply, I ran over to the string. Just as I grabbed it, I heard 
footsteps outside the room. A few seconds later, a can of Coke came floating 
through the door. 

“Miss me?” Erin asked playfully. 

“You scared us to death!” I cried, my voice squeaking. 

Erin laughed. “I didn’t know you cared.” 

“That wasn’t funny, Erin,” Zack said sternly. For once he was agreeing with 
me. “You really did scare us.” 

“I got thirsty,” Erin replied. The Coke can tilted up. We saw Coke start to 
pour out of it. The liquid abruptly disappeared as it flowed into Erin’s mouth. 

“I guess being invisible makes you really thirsty,” Erin explained. “So I 
slipped downstairs and got a Coke.” 

“But you should’ve told us,” April scolded, her eyes turned back to her 
watch. “Nine minutes.” 

“You shouldn’t go downstairs,” I added heatedly. “I mean, what if my mom 
saw you?” 

“Saw me?” 

“Well... you know what I mean,” I muttered. 

Erin laughed. I didn’t think it was funny. 

Why was I the only one taking this seriously? 

Erin beat Lefty’s record and kept going. When April called out twelve 
minutes, Zack asked Erin if she wanted to come back. 

No reply. 

“Erin? Are you goofing on us again?” I demanded. 

Still no reply. 

I could feel my throat tighten once again with fear. I walked over and pulled 
the string. My hand was shaking as I pulled it. I prayed silently to myself that 
Erin would return okay. 

The light went out. The three of us waited tensely for Erin to come back. 

After what seemed an endless wait, she shimmered back into view. She 



turned quickly away from the mirror, a triumphant smile on her face. “The new 
champ!” she declared, raising her fists in a gesture of victory. 

“You’re okay?” I asked, my feeling of fear refusing to leave. 

She nodded. “Just fine, worrywart.” She stepped away from the mirror, 
walking unsteadily. 

I stared at her. Something about her looked different. 

She looked perfectly okay. Not pale or sick-looking or anything. But 
something was different. Her smile? Her hair? I wished I could figure out what. 

“Max, pull the string.” Zack’s eager voice jerked me away from my 
thoughts. “Let’s go, man. I’m going for fifteen minutes.” 

“Okay. Get ready,” I said, glancing at Erin as I grabbed for the string. She 
flashed me a reassuring smile. 

But something about her smile was different. 

Something. 

But what? 

I pulled the string. Zack vanished in the flash of bright light. 

“Return of the Invisible Man!” he cried in a deep voice. 

“Not so loud,” I warned him. “My mom’ll hear you downstairs.” 

Erin had lowered herself to the floor beside April. I walked over and stood 
over her. “You sure you’re okay?” I asked. “You don’t feel dizzy or weird or 
anything?” 

She shook her head. “No. Really. Why don’t you believe me, Max?” 

As I stared down at her, I tried to figure out what was different about her 
appearance. What a mystery! I just couldn’t put my finger on it. 

“Well, how come you didn’t answer when I called you?” I demanded. 

“Huh?” Her face filled with surprise. “When?” 

“At about twelve minutes,” I told her. “I called you and Zack called you. 
But you didn’t answer us.” 

Erin’s expression turned thoughtful. “I guess I didn’t hear you,” she replied 
finally. “But I’m fine, Max. Really. I feel great. It was really awesome.” 

I joined them on the floor and leaned back against the wall to wait for 
Zack’s turn to be over. “I really mean it. Don’t turn off the light till fifteen 
minutes,” he reminded me. 

Then he messed up my hair, making it stand straight up in the air. 

Both girls laughed. 

I had to get up, walk over to the mirror, and comb it back down. I don’t 



know why people think messed-up hair is such a riot. I really don’t get it. 

“Hey, follow me. I’ve got an idea,” Zack said. His voice was coming from 
the doorway. 

“Whoa—hold on!” I called. But I could hear his sneakers clomping across 
the attic. 

“Follow me outside,” he called to us. We heard his footsteps on the attic 
stairs. 

“Zack—don’t do it,” I pleaded. “Whatever it is, don’t do it!” 

But there was no way he was going to listen to me. 

A few seconds later, we were out the back door, following our invisible 
friend toward our neighbor Mr. Evander’s back yard. 

This is going to be trouble, I thought unhappily. Big trouble. 

Erin, April, and I hid behind the hedge that separated our two yards. As 
usual, Mr. Evander was out in his tomato garden, stooped over, pulling up 
weeds, his big belly hanging out under his T-shirt, his red bald head shiny under 
the sun. 

What is Zack going to do? I wondered, holding my breath, my whole body 
heavy with dread. 

And then I saw three tomatoes float up from the ground. They hovered in 
the air, then floated closer to Mr. Evander. 

Oh, no, I thought, groaning silently to myself. 

Please, Zack. Please don’t do it. 

Erin, April, and I were huddled together behind the hedge, staring in 
disbelief as the three tomatoes began to circle each other rapidly in the air. 

Invisible Zack was juggling them. Showing off, as usual. He was always 
bragging about how he could juggle, and we couldn’t. 

It took a while for Mr. Evander to notice. 

But when he finally saw the three tomatoes spinning around in midair a few 
feet in front of him, his eyes bugged out and his face turned as red as the 
tomatoes! 

“Oh!” he cried. He let the weeds fall from his hands. And then he just 
stared at the spinning tomatoes, like he was frozen. 

Zack tossed the tomatoes higher as he juggled. 

April and Erin held hands over their mouths to stifle their laughter. They 
thought Zack’s stunt was a real hoot. But I just wanted to get Zack back up to the 
attic. 



“Hey, Mary! Mary!” Mr. Evander started calling to his wife. “Mary—come 
out here! You’ve got to see this! Mary!” 

A few seconds later, his wife came running across the yard, a frightened 
expression on her face. “Mike, what’s wrong? What’s wrong?” 

“Look—these tomatoes are twirling in the air!” Mr. Evander cried, 
motioning wildly for her to hurry. 

Zack let the tomatoes fall to the ground. 

“Where?” Mrs. Evander asked breathlessly, running as fast as she could. 

“There. Look!” Mr. Evander pointed. 

“I don’t see any tomatoes,” Mrs. Evander said, stopping in front of her 
husband, panting loudly. 

“Yes! They’re spinning. They’re—” 

“Those tomatoes?” Mrs. Evander asked, pointing to the three tomatoes on 
the ground. 

“Well... yes. They were twirling around, and—” Looking terribly confused, 
Mr. Evander scratched the back of his neck. 

“Mike, how long have you been out in the sun?” his wife scolded. “Didn’t I 
tell you to wear a cap?” 

“Uh... I’ll be in in a few minutes,” Mr. Evander said softly, staring down at 
the tomatoes. 

As soon as Mrs. Evander turned and headed back to the house, the three 
tomatoes floated up from the ground and began twirling in the air again. 

“Mary, look!” Mr. Evander shouted excitedly. “Look—quick! They’re 
doing it again!” 

Zack let the tomatoes drop to the ground. 

Mrs. Evander spun around and stared into empty space. “Mike, you’d better 
come with me —right now,” she insisted. She hurried back, grabbed Mr. Evander 
by the arm, and pulled him away. The poor man looked totally bewildered, 
staring at the tomatoes on the ground, still scratching the back of his neck as his 
wife pulled him to the house. 

“Hey, this is awesome!” Zack cried, right in front of me. 

Erin and April collapsed in wild giggles. I had to admit it was pretty funny. 
We laughed about it for a while. Then we sneaked back into the house and up to 
the attic. 

In the safety of the little room, we laughed some more about Zack’s 
juggling stunt. Zack bragged that he was the world’s first invisible juggler. 



Then, at twelve minutes, Zack suddenly stopped answering us. 

Just as Erin had. 

The three of us called his name over and over. 

Silence. 

Zack didn’t reply. 

“I’m going to bring him back,” I said, instantly gripped with fear once 
again. I ran to the string. 

“Wait,” Erin said, holding me back. 

“Huh? What for?” I pulled away from her. 

“He said to wait till fifteen minutes, remember?” she argued. 

“Erin, he’s completely disappeared!” I cried. 

“But he’ll be really mad,” Erin pleaded. 

“I say bring him back,” April said anxiously. 

“Give him until fifteen minutes,” Erin insisted. 

“No,” I said. I pulled the string. 

The light clicked off. 

A few minutes later, Zack flickered back. He smiled at us. “How long?” he 
asked, turning to April. 

“Thirteen minutes, twenty seconds,” she told him. 

His grin widened. “The new champ!” 

“You’re okay? You didn’t answer us,” I said, studying his face. 

“I’m fine. I didn’t hear you calling me. But I’m fine.” 

Zack looked different to me, too. Something was very different about him. 
But what? 

“What’s your problem, Max?” he demanded. “Why are you staring at me 
like I’m some kind of alien life-form or something?” 

“Your hair,” I said, studying him. “Was it like that before?” 

“Huh? What are you talking about? Are you freaking out or something?” 
Zack asked, rolling his eyes. 

“Was your hair like that before?” I repeated. “Buzzed real short on the right 
and then combed long to the left? Wasn’t it the other way around?” 

“You’re messed up, Max,” he said, grinning at Erin and April. “My hair is 
the same it’s always been. You’ve been staring in that mirror too long or 
something.” 

I could’ve sworn his hair had been short on the left, long on the right. But I 
guess Zack would know his own hair. 



“Are you going to go?” Erin asked, jumping up behind me. 

“Yeah, are you going to beat fifteen minutes?” Zack asked. 

I shook my head. “No, I really don’t feel like it,” I told them truthfully. 
“Let’s declare Zack the winner and get out of here.” 

“No way!” Zack and Erin declared in unison. 

“You’ve got to try,” Zack insisted. 

“Don’t wimp out, Max. You can beat Zack. I know you can,” Erin declared. 
She and Zack both pushed me up to the mirror. 

I tried to pull back. But they practically held me in place. 

“No. Really,” I said. “Zack can be the winner. I—” 

“Go for it, Max!” Erin urged. “I’m betting on you!” 

“Yeah. Go for it,” Zack repeated, his hand firmly on my shoulder. 

“No. Please—” I said. 

But Zack reached up with his free hand and pulled the string. 



21 


I stared into the mirror for a moment, waiting for the glare to fade from my eyes. 
It was always such a shock. That first moment, when your reflection 
disappeared. When you stared at the spot where you knew you were standing— 
and realized you were looking right through yourself! 

“How do you feel, Max? How do you feel?” Erin asked, imitating me. 

“Erin, what’s your problem?” I snapped. It wasn’t like her to be so 
sarcastic. 

“Just giving you a taste of your own medicine,” she replied, grinning. 

Something about her smile was lopsided, not normal. 

“Think you can beat my record?” Zack demanded. 

“I don’t know. Maybe,” I replied uncertainly. 

Zack stepped up to the mirror and studied his reflection. I had the strangest 
feeling as I watched him. I can’t really explain it. I’d never seen Zack stand in 
just that position and admire himself in just that way. 

Something was different. I knew it. But I couldn’t figure out what. 

Maybe it’s just my nervousness, I told myself. 

I’m just so stressed out. Maybe it’s affecting the way I look at my friends. 
Maybe I’m making all this up. 

“Two minutes,” April announced. 

“Are you just going to stand there?” Erin asked, staring into the mirror. 
“Aren’t you going to move around or anything, Max?” 

“No. I don’t think so,” I said. “I mean, I can’t think of anything I want to 
do. I’m just going to wait till the time is up.” 

“You want to quit now?” Zack asked, grinning at the spot where he thought 
I was standing. 

I shook my head. Then I remembered that no one could see it. “No. I might 
as well go the distance,” I told him. “Since I’m here, I might as well make you 
look bad, Zack.” 

He laughed scornfully. “You won’t beat thirteen-twenty,” he said 
confidently. “No way.” 

“Well, you know what?” I said, angered by his smug tone of voice. “I’m 
just going to stand here until I do.” 



And that’s what I did. I stood in place, leaning against the mirror frame, 
while April counted off the minutes. 

I did okay until a short while after she had called out eleven minutes. Then, 
suddenly, the glare of the light began to hurt my eyes. 

I closed my eyes, but it didn’t help. The light grew brighter, harsher. It 
seemed to sweep around me, surround me, fold over me. 

And then I began to feel dizzy and light. As if I were about to float away, 
even though I knew I was standing in place. 

“Hey, guys?” I called out. “I think I’ve had enough.” 

My voice sounded tiny and far away, even to me. 

The light swirled around me. I felt myself grow lighter, lighter, until I had 
to struggle to keep my feet on the floor to keep from floating away. 

I uttered a high-pitched cry. I was suddenly gripped by panic. 

Cold panic. 

“Zack—bring me back!” I shouted. 

“Okay, Max. No problem,” I heard Zack reply. 

He seemed miles and miles away. 

I struggled to see him through the blinding yellow light. He was a dark 
figure behind the wall of light, a dark figure moving quickly to the mirror. 

“I’m bringing you back now, Max. Hold on,” I heard Zack say. 

The bright light glowed even brighter. It hurt so much. Even with my eyes 
closed, it hurt. 

“Zack, pull the string!” I shouted. 

I opened my eyes to see his dim shadow reaching up to the string. 

Pull it, pull it, pull it! I urged silently. 

I knew that in a second, the light would go off. And I’d be safe. 

A second. 

One tug of the string. 

Pull it, pull it, pull it, Zack! 

Zack reached for the string. I saw him grab it. 

And then I heard another voice in the room. A new voice. A surprised 
voice. 

“Hi. What’s going on up here? What are you kids doing?” 

I saw the shadowy figure of Zack drop the string and step away without 
pulling it. 

My mom had burst into the room. 



22 


“Please—pull the string!” I called. 

No one seemed to hear me. 

“We’re just hanging out,” I heard Zack tell my mom. 

“But where’s Max?” I heard her ask. “How did you find this little room? 
What are you all doing in here?” Her voice sounded as if it were coming from 
underwater, far, far away. 

The entire room began to shimmer in the light, flickering on and off. I held 
on tightly to the frame of the mirror, struggling not to float away. 

“Can you hear me?” I called. “Please, somebody—pull the string! Bring me 
back!” 

They were just gray shadows in the wavering, rolling light. They didn’t 
seem to hear me. 

Gripping the frame tightly, I saw a shadow approach the mirror. My mom. 
She walked around it, admiring it. 

“I can’t believe we never knew about this room. Where did this old mirror 
come from?” I heard her ask. 

She was standing so close to me. They all were. 

They were so close and so far away at the same time. 

“Please bring me back!” I shouted. 

I listened for an answer. But the voices faded away. 

The shadows moved in a flickering blur. I tried to reach out to them, but 
they were too far away. 

I let go of the mirror frame and began to float. 

“Mom, I’m right here. Can’t you hear me? Can’t you do anything?” 

So light, so completely weightless, I floated in front of the mirror. 

My feet were off the floor. I couldn’t see them in the blinding glare. 

I floated to the mirror glass, under the light. 

I could feel the light pull me closer. Closer. 

Until it pulled me right into the mirror. 

I knew I was inside the mirror. Inside a glistening blur of colors. The shapes 
shimmered and rolled together as if underwater. 



And I floated through the glimmering shards of light and color, floated 
silently away from my friends, away from my mom, floated away from the tiny 
attic room. 

Into the center of the mirror. 

Into the center of an undulating, rolling world of twisting lights and colors. 

“Help me!” I cried. 

But my voice was muffled by the blurred, shifting colors. 

“Bring me back! Get me back!” 

Floating deeper into this glimmering world, I could barely hear myself. 

Deeper into the mirror. And still deeper. 

The colors gave way to shapes of gray and black. It was cold here. Cold as 
glass. 

And as I floated deeper, deeper, the grays and blacks faded, too. The world 
was white now. Pure white all around. Shadowless white as far as I could see. 

I stared straight ahead, no longer calling out, too frightened to call out, too 
mystified by the cold, ivory world I had entered. 

“Hello, Max,” a familiar voice said. 

“Ohh!” I cried out, realizing I was not alone. 



23 


A scream of terror escaped my lips. I tried to form words, but my brain seemed 
to be paralyzed. 

The figure approached quickly, silently, through the cold, white world of 
the mirror. He smiled at me, an eerie, familiar smile. 

“You!” I managed to scream. 

He stopped inches away from me. 

I stared at him in disbelief. 

I was staring at myself. Me. Smiling back at me. The smile as cold as the 
glass that surrounded us. 

“Don’t be afraid,” he said. “I’m your reflection.” 

“No!” 

His eyes —my eyes—studied me hungrily, like a dog staring at a meaty 
bone. His smile grew wider as I cried out my fear. 

“I’ve been waiting here for you,” my reflection said, his eyes locked on 
mine. 

“No!” I repeated. 

I turned away. 

I knew I had to get away. 

I started to run. 

But I stopped short when I saw the faces in front of me. Distorted, unhappy 
faces, dozens of them, fun house mirror faces, with enormous, drooping eyes, 
and tiny mouths tight with sadness. 

The faces seemed to hover just ahead of me. The gaping eyes staring at me, 
the tiny mouths moving rapidly as if calling to me, warning me, telling me to get 
away. 

Who were these people, these faces? 

Why were they inside the mirror with me? 

Why did their distorted, twisted images reveal so much sadness, so much 
pain? 

“No!” 

I gasped as I thought I recognized two of the floating faces, their mouths 



working furiously, their eyebrows rising wildly up and down. 

Erin and Zack? 

No. 

That was impossible, wasn’t it? 

I stared hard at them. Why were they talking so frantically? What were they 
trying to tell me? 

“Help me!” I called. But they didn’t seem to hear me. 

The faces, dozens of them, bobbed and floated. 

“Help me—please!” 

And then I felt myself being spun around. I stared into the eyes of my 
reflection as he gripped my shoulders and held me in place. 

“You’re not leaving,” he told me. His quiet voice echoed through the clear 
stillness, icicles scratching against glass. 

I struggled to free myself, but his grip was strong. 

“I’m the one to leave,” he told me. “I’ve been waiting so long. Ever since 
you turned on the light. And now I’m going to step out from here and join the 
others.” 

“Others?” I cried. 

“Your friends gave in easily,” he said. “They did not resist. The switch was 
made. And now you and I will also make a switch.” 

“No!” I screamed, and my cry seemed to echo through the icy cold for 
miles. 

“Why are you so afraid?” he asked, turning me around, still gripping my 
shoulders, bringing his face close to mine. “Are you so afraid of your other side, 
Max?” 

He stared at me intently. “That’s what I am, you know,” he said. “I am your 
reflection. Your other side. Your cold side. Don’t be afraid of me. Your friends 
were not afraid. They made the switch without much of a struggle. Now they are 
inside the mirror. And their reflections...” 

His voice trailed off. He didn’t have to finish his sentence. I knew what he 
was saying. 

Now I understood about Erin and Zack. Now I understood why they looked 
different to me. 

They were reversed. They were their own reflections. 

And now I understood why they pushed me into the mirror, why they 
forced me to disappear, too. 



If I didn’t do something, I realized, my reflection would switch places with 
me. My reflection would step into the attic. And I’d be trapped inside the mirror 
forever, trapped forever with the sad, bobbing faces. 

But what could I do? 

Staring at myself, I decided to stall, to ask questions, to give myself a little 
time to think. 

“Whose mirror is it? Who built it?” I demanded. 

He shrugged. “How should I know? I’m only your reflection, remember?” 

“But how—” 

“It’s time,” he said eagerly. “Don’t try to stall with foolish questions. Time 
to make the switch. Time for you to become my reflection!” 



24 


I pulled away. 

I started to run. 

The sad, distorted faces hovered in front of me. 

I shut my eyes and dodged away from them. 

I couldn’t think. Couldn’t breathe. 

My legs pumped. My arms flew out at my sides. It was so clear and bright, 
I couldn’t tell if I was moving or not. My feet couldn’t feel a floor. There were 
no walls, no ceiling. There was no air brushing my face as I ran. 

But my fear kept me moving. Through the clear, cold, shimmering light. 

He was behind me. 

I couldn’t hear him. 

He had no shadow. 

But I knew he was right behind me. 

And I knew that if he caught me, I’d be lost. Lost inside this blank world, 
unable to see, to hear, to smell, to touch anything, lost in the cold glass forever. 

Another silent, bobbing face. 

And so I kept running. 

Until the colors returned. 

Until light bent to form shapes. 

And I saw shadows moving and shifting in front of me. 

“Stop, Max!” I heard my reflection’s voice right behind me. “Stop right 
there!” 

But now he sounded worried. 

And so I kept running, running into the colors and moving shapes. 

Suddenly, Zack turned off the light. 

I came bursting out of the mirror, into the tiny attic room, into an explosion 
of sound, of color, of hard surfaces, of real things. The real world. 

I stood up, panting, gasping for breath. I tested my legs. I stomped on the 
floor. The solid floor. 

I turned my eyes to my friends, who were standing in front of me, startled 
expressions on their faces. My mom, I realized, must have retreated back 



downstairs. 

“Did you make the switch?” Zack asked eagerly, his eyes glowing with 
excitement. 

“Are you one of us?” Erin asked at the same time. 

“No,” said a voice—my voice—coming from just behind me. 

We all stared into the mirror. 

Inside it, my reflection, red-faced and angry, glared out at us, his hands 
pressed against the glass. “He got away,” my reflection told my friends. “The 
switch wasn’t made.” 

“I don’t understand!” I heard April cry. “What’s going on, guys?” 

Zack and Erin ignored her. They stepped up quickly and grabbed me by the 
arms. They spun me around roughly. 

“The switch wasn’t made,” my reflection repeated from inside the glass. 

“No problem,” Erin told it. 

She and Zack forced me up to the mirror. 

“You’re going back in, Max,” Zack said heatedly. 

He reached up and pulled the light cord. 



25 


The light flashed on. 

I went invisible. 

My reflection remained in the mirror, open palms pressed against the inside 
of the glass, staring out. 

“I’m waiting for you, Max,” he said. “In a few minutes, you’ll join me in 
here.” 

“No!” I shouted. “I’m leaving. I’m going downstairs.” 

“No, you’re not,” my reflection said, shaking his head. “Erin and Zack 
won’t let you escape. But don’t be so frightened, Max. It’s all quite painless. 
Really.” He smiled. It was my smile. But it was cold. Cruel. 

“I don’t get this,” April was protesting back by the door. “Will someone tell 
me what’s going on?” 

“You’ll see, April,” Erin told her soothingly. 

What am I going to do? I wondered, frozen in panic. 

What can I do? 

“Just a few more minutes,” my reflection said calmly, already celebrating 
his victory. His freedom. 

“April, get help!” I cried. 

She spun around at the sound of my voice. “Huh?” 

“Get help! Go downstairs. Get help! Hurry!” I screamed. 

“But—I don’t understand—” April hesitated. 

Erin and Zack moved to block her path. 

But the door suddenly swung open. 

I saw Lefty stop at the doorway. He peered in. Saw my reflection. 

He must have thought the reflection was me. 

“Think fast!” he shouted, and he tossed a softball. 

The ball smashed into the mirror. 

I saw the startled look on Lefty’s face. And then I heard the crash and saw 
the mirror crack and shatter. 

My reflection didn’t have time to react. He broke into shards of glass and 
fell to the floor. 



“Nooooo!” Erin and Zack shrieked. 

I popped back into view just as Erin’s and Zack’s reflections floated up off 
the floor. They were sucked into the broken mirror—screaming all the way— 
sucked into it as if a powerful vacuum cleaner were pulling them in. 

The two reflections flew screaming into the mirror and appeared to crack 
into hundreds of pieces. 

“Whoa!” Lefty cried, gripping the door with all his strength, pressing his 
body against the doorframe, struggling to keep himself from being sucked into 
the room. 

And then Erin and Zack dropped onto the floor on their knees, looking 
dazed and confused, staring at the pieces of shattered mirror that littered the 
floor around them. 

“You’re back!” I cried happily. “It’s really you!” 

“Yeah. It’s me,” Zack said, climbing unsteadily to his feet, then turning to 
help Erin up. 

The mirror was shattered. The reflections were gone. 

Erin and Zack gazed around the room, still shaken and dazed. 

April stared at me in total confusion. 

Lefty remained outside the doorway, shaking his head. “Max,” he said, 
“you should’ve caught the ball. That was an easy catch.” 

Erin and Zack were back. And they were okay. 

It didn’t take long to get everything back to normal. 

We explained everything to April and Lefty as best we could. 

April went home. She had to baby-sit her little sister. 

Erin and Zack—the real Erin and Zack—helped me sweep up the broken 
glass. Then we closed the door to the little room. I latched it tightly, and we all 
carried cartons over and stacked them up to block off the door. 

We knew we’d never go in there again. 

We vowed never to tell anyone about getting invisible or the mirror or what 
happened in that little room. Then Erin and Zack headed home. 

Later, Lefty and I were hanging around out in the back yard. “That was so 
scary,” I told Lefty with a shudder. “You just can’t imagine what it was like.” 

“Sounds pretty scary,” Lefty replied absently. He tossed his softball from 
hand to hand. “But at least everything is okay now. Want to play a little catch?” 

“No,” I shook my head. I wasn’t in the mood. But then I changed my mind. 
“Maybe it’ll take my mind off what happened this morning,” I said. 



Lefty tossed me the ball. We trotted behind the garage, our usual place for 
tossing the ball around. 

I lobbed it back to him. 

We were having a pretty good game of catch. 

Until about five minutes had gone by. 

Until... 

Until I stopped and froze in place. 

Were my eyes playing tricks on me? 

“Here comes my fastball,” he said. He heaved it at me. 

No. No. No. 

I gaped open-mouthed as the ball shot past me. 

I didn’t even try to catch it. I couldn’t move. 

I could only stare in horror. 

My brother was throwing right-handed. 




NIGHT OF THE 
LIVING DUMMY 
Goosebumps - 07 
R.L. Stine 


1 


“Mmmmm! Mmmm! Mmmmm!” 

Kris Powell struggled to get her twin sister’s attention. 

Lindy Powell glanced up from the book she was reading to see what 
the problem was. Instead of her sister’s pretty face, Lindy saw a round, pink 
bubble nearly the size of Kris’ head. 

“Nice one,” Lindy said without much enthusiasm. With a sudden 
move, she poked the bubble and popped it. 

“Hey!” Kris cried as the pink bubble gum exploded onto her cheeks 
and chin. 

Lindy laughed. “Gotcha.” 

Kris angrily grabbed Lindy’s paperback and slammed it shut. “Whoops 
—lost your place!” she exclaimed. She knew her sister hated to lose her 
place in a book. 

Lindy grabbed the book back with a scowl. Kris struggled to pull the 
pink gum off her face. 

“That was the biggest bubble I ever blew,” she said angrily. The gum 
wasn’t coming off her chin. 

“I’ve blown much bigger than that,” Lindy said with a superior sneer. 

“I don’t believe you two,” their mother muttered, making her way into 
their bedroom and dropping a neatly folded pile of laundry at the foot of 
Kris’ bed. “You even compete over bubble gum?” 

“We’re not competing,” Lindy muttered. She tossed back her blonde 
ponytail and returned her eyes to her book. 

Both girls had straight blonde hair. But Lindy kept hers long, usually 
tying it behind her head or on one side in a ponytail. And Kris had hers cut 
very short. 

It was a way for people to tell the twins apart, for they were nearly 
identical in every other way. Both had broad foreheads and round, blue 
eyes. Both had dimples in their cheeks when they smiled. Both blushed 
easily, large pink circles forming on their pale cheeks. 

Both thought their noses were a little too wide. Both wished they were 
a little taller. Lindy’s best friend, Alice, was nearly three inches taller, even 



though she hadn’t turned twelve yet. 

“Did I get it all off?” Kris asked, rubbing her chin, which was red and 
sticky. 

“Not all,” Lindy told her, glancing up. “There’s some in your hair.” 

“Oh, great,” Kris muttered. She grabbed at her hair, but couldn’t find 
any bubble gum. 

“Gotcha again,” Lindy said, laughing. “You’re too easy!” 

Kris uttered an angry growl. “Why are you always so mean to me?” 

“Me? Mean?” Lindy looked up in wide-eyed innocence. “I’m an angel. 
Ask anyone.” 

Exasperated, Kris turned back to her mother, who was stuffing socks 
into a dresser drawer. “Mom, when am I going to get my own room?” 

“On the Twelfth of Never,” Mrs. Powell replied, grinning. 

Kris groaned. “That’s what you always say.” 

Her mother shrugged. “You know we don’t have a spare inch, Kris.” 
She turned to the bedroom window. Bright sunlight streamed through the 
filmy curtains. “It’s a beautiful day. What are you two doing inside?” 

“Mom, we’re not little girls,” Lindy said, rolling her eyes. “We’re 
twelve. We’re too old to go out and play.” 

“Did I get it all?” Kris asked, still scraping pink patches of bubble gum 
off her chin. 

“Leave it. It improves your complexion,” Lindy told her. 

“I wish you girls would be nicer to each other,” Mrs. Powell said with 
a sigh. 

They suddenly heard shrill barking coming from downstairs. “What’s 
Barky excited about now?” Mrs. Powell fretted. The little black terrier was 
always barking about something. “Why not take Barky for a walk?” 

“Don’t feel like it,” Lindy muttered, nose in her book. 

“What about those beautiful new bikes you got for your birthdays?” 
Mrs. Powell said, hands on hips. “Those bikes you just couldn’t live 
without. You know, the ones that have been sitting in the garage since you 
got them.” 

“Okay, okay. You don’t have to be sarcastic, Mom,” Lindy said, 
closing her book. She stood up, stretched, and tossed the book onto her bed. 

“You want to?” Kris asked Lindy. 

“Want to what?” 



“Go for a bike ride. We could ride to the playground, see if anyone’s 
hanging out at school.” 

“You just want to see if Robby is there,” Lindy said, making a face. 

“So?” Kris said, blushing. 

“Go on. Get some fresh air,” Mrs. Powell urged. “I’ll see you later. I’m 
off to the supermarket.” 

Kris peered into the dresser mirror. She had gotten most of the gum 
off. She bmshed her short, hair back with both hands. “Come on. Let’s go 
out,” she said. “Last one out is a rotten egg.” She darted to the doorway, 
beating her sister by half a step. 

As they burst out the back door, with Barky yipping shrilly behind 
them, the afternoon sun was high in a cloudless sky. The air was still and 
dry. It felt more like summer than spring. 

Both girls were wearing shorts and sleeveless T-shirts. Lindy bent to 
pull open the garage door, then stopped. The house next door caught her 
eye. 

“Look—they’ve got the walls up,” she told Kris, pointing across their 
back yard. 

“That new house is going up so quickly. It’s amazing,” Kris said 
following her sister’s gaze. 

The builders had knocked down the old house during the winter. The 
new concrete foundation had been put down in March. Lindy and Kris had 
walked around on it when no workers were there, trying to figure out where 
the different rooms would go. 

And now the walls had been built. The construction suddenly looked 
like a real house, rising up in the midst of tall stacks of lumber, a big mound 
of red-brown dirt, a pile of concrete blocks, and an assortment of power 
saws, tools, and machinery. 

“No one’s working today,” Lindy said. 

They took a few steps toward the new house. “Who do you think will 
move in?” Kris wondered. “Maybe some great-looking guy our age. Maybe 
great-looking twin guys!” 

“Yuck!” Lindy made a disgusted face. “Twin guys? How drippy can 
you get! I can’t believe you and I are in the same family.” 

Kris was used to Lindy’s sarcasm. Both girls liked being twins and 
hated being twins at the same time. Because they shared nearly everything 



—their looks, their clothing, their room—they were closer than most sisters 
ever get. 

But because they were so much alike, they also managed to drive each 
other crazy a lot of the time. 

“No one’s around. Let’s check out the new house,” Lindy said. 

Kris followed her across the yard. A squirrel, halfway up the wide 
trunk of a maple tree, watched them warily. 

They made their way through an opening in the low shrubs that 
divided the two yards. Then, walking past the stacks of lumber and the tall 
mound of dirt, they climbed the concrete stoop. 

A sheet of heavy plastic had been nailed over the opening where the 
front door would go. Kris pulled one end of the plastic up, and they slipped 
into the house. 

It was dark and cool inside and had a fresh wood smell. The plaster 
walls were up but hadn’t been painted. 

“Careful,” Lindy warned. “Nails.” She pointed to the large nails 
scattered over the floor. “If you step on one, you’ll get lockjaw and die.” 

“You wish,” Kris said. 

“I don’t want you to die,” Lindy replied. “Just get lockjaw.” She 
snickered. 

“Ha-ha,” Kris said sarcastically. “This must be the living room,” she 
said, making her way carefully across the front room to the fireplace against 
the back wall. 

“A cathedral ceiling,” Lindy said, staring up at the dark, exposed 
wooden beams above their heads. “Neat.” 

“This is bigger than our living room,” Kris remarked, peering out the 
large picture window to the street. 

“It smells great,” Lindy said, taking a deep breath. “All the sawdust. It 
smells so piney.” 

They made their way through the hall and explored the kitchen. “Are 
those wires on?” Kris asked, pointing to a cluster of black electrical wires 
suspended from the ceiling beams. 

“Why don’t you touch one and find out?” Lindy suggested. 

“You first,” Kris shot back. 

“The kitchen isn’t very big,” Lindy said, bending down to stare into 
the holes where the kitchen cabinets would go. 



She stood up and was about to suggest they check out the upstairs 
when she heard a sound. “Huh?” Her eyes widened in surprise. “Is someone 
in here?” 

Kris froze in the middle of the kitchen. 

They both listened. 

Silence. 

Then they heard soft, rapid footsteps. Close by. Inside the house. 

“Let’s go!” Lindy whispered. 

Kris was already ducking under the plastic, heading out the doorway 
opening. She leapt off the back stoop and started running toward their back 
yard. 

Lindy stopped at the bottom of the stoop and turned back to the new 
house. “Hey—look!” she called. 

A squirrel came flying out a side window. It landed on the dirt with all 
four feet moving and scrambled toward the maple tree in the Powells’ yard. 

Lindy laughed. “Just a dumb squirrel.” 

Kris stopped near the low shrubs. “You sure?” She hesitated, watching 
the windows of the new house. “That was a pretty loud squirrel.” 

When she turned back from the house, she was surprised to find that 
Lindy had disappeared. 

“Hey—where’d you go?” 

“Over here,” Lindy called. “I see something!” 

It took Kris a while to locate her sister. Lindy was half-hidden behind a 
large black trash Dumpster at the far end of the yard. 

Kris shielded her eyes with one hand to see better. Lindy was bent over 
the side of the Dumpster. She appeared to be rummaging through some 
trash. 

“What’s in there?” Kris called. 

Lindy was tossing things around and didn’t seem to hear her. 

“What is it?” Kris called, taking a few reluctant steps toward the 
Dumpster. 

Lindy didn’t reply. 

Then, slowly, she pulled something out. She started to hold it up. Its 
arms and legs dangled down limply. Kris could see a head with brown hair. 

A head? Arms and legs? 

“Oh, no!” Kris cried aloud, raising her hands to her face in horror. 



2 


A child? 

Kris uttered a silent gasp, staring in horror as Lindy lifted him out of 
the trash Dumpster. 

She could see his face, frozen in a wide-eyed stare. His brown hair 
stood stiffly on top of his head. He seemed to be wearing some sort of gray 
suit. 

His arms and legs dangled lifelessly. 

“Lindy!” Kris called, her throat tight with fear. “Is it—is he... alive?” 

Her heart pounding, Kris started to run to her sister. Lindy was 
cradling the poor thing in her arms. 

“Is he alive?” Kris repeated breathlessly. 

She stopped short when her sister started to laugh. 

“No. Not alive!” Lindy called gleefully. 

And then Kris realized that it wasn’t a child after all. “A dummy!” she 
shrieked. 

Lindy held it up. “A ventriloquist’s dummy,” she said. “Someone 
threw him out. Do you believe it? He’s in perfect shape.” 

It took Lindy a while to notice that Kris was breathing hard, her face 
bright red. “Kris, what’s your problem? Oh, wow. Did you think he was a 
real kid?” Lindy laughed scornfully. 

“No. Of course not,” Kris insisted. 

Lindy held the dummy up and examined his back, looking for the 
string to pull to make his mouth move. “I am a real kid!” Lindy made him 
say. She was speaking in a high-pitched voice through gritted teeth, trying 
not to move her lips. 

“Dumb,” Kris said, rolling her eyes. 

“I am not dumb. You’re dumb!” Lindy made the dummy say in a high, 
squeaky voice. When she pulled the string in his back, the wooden lips 
moved up and down, clicking as they moved. She moved her hand up his 
back and found the control to make his painted eyes shift from side to side. 

“He’s probably filled with bugs,” Kris said, making a disgusted face. 
“Throw him back, Lindy.” 



“No way,” Lindy insisted, rubbing her hand tenderly over the dummy’s 
wooden hair. “I’m keeping him.” 

“She’s keeping me,” she made the dummy say. 

Kris stared suspiciously at the dummy. His brown hair was painted on 
his head. His blue eyes moved only from side to side and couldn’t blink. He 
had bright red painted lips, curved up into an eerie smile. The lower lip had 
a chip on one side so that it didn’t quite match the upper lip. 

The dummy wore a gray, double-breasted suit over a white shirt collar. 
The collar wasn’t attached to a shirt. Instead, the dummy’s wooden chest 
was painted white. Big brown leather shoes were attached to the ends of his 
thin, dangling legs. 

“My name is Slappy,” Lindy made the dummy say, moving his 
grinning mouth up and down. 

“Dumb,” Kris repeated, shaking her head. “Why Slappy?” 

“Come over here and I’ll slap you!” Lindy made him say, trying not to 
move her lips. 

Kris groaned. “Are we going to ride our bikes to the playground or 
not, Lindy?” 

“Afraid poor Robby misses you?” Lindy made Slappy ask. 

“Put that ugly thing down,” Kris replied impatiently. 

“I’m not ugly,” Slappy said in Lindy’s squeaky voice, sliding his eyes 
from side to side. “You’re ugly!” 

“Your lips are moving,” Kris told Lindy. “You’re a lousy 
ventriloquist.” 

“I’ll get better,” Lindy insisted. 

“You mean you’re really keeping it?” Kris cried. 

“I like Slappy. He’s cute,” Lindy said, cuddling the dummy against the 
front of her T-shirt. 

“I’m cute,” she made him say. “And you’re ugly.” 

“Shut up,” Kris snapped to the dummy. 

“You shut up!” Slappy replied in Lindy’s tight, high-pitched voice. 

“What do you want to keep him for?” Kris asked, following her sister 
toward the street. 

“I always liked puppets,” Lindy recalled. “Remember those 
marionettes I used to have? I played with them for hours at a time. I made 
up long plays with them.” 



“I always played with the marionettes, too,” Kris remembered. 

“You got the strings all tangled up,” Lindy said, frowning. “You 
weren’t any good at it.” 

“But what are you going to do with this dummy?” Kris demanded. 

“I don’t know. Maybe I’ll work up an act,” Lindy said thoughtfully, 
shifting Slappy to her other arm. “I’ll bet I could earn some money with 
him. You know. Appear at kids’ birthday parties. Put on shows.” 

“Happy birthday!” she made Slappy declare. “Hand over some 
money!” 

Kris didn’t laugh. 

The two girls walked along the street in front of their house. Lindy 
cradled Slappy in her arms, one hand up his back. 

“I think he’s creepy,” Kris said, kicking a large pebble across the 
street. “You should put him back in the Dumpster.” 

“No way,” Lindy insisted. 

“No way,” she made Slappy say, shaking his head, his glassy blue eyes 
moving from side to side. “I’ll put you in the Dumpster!” 

“Slappy sure is mean,” Kris remarked, frowning at Lindy. 

Lindy laughed. “Don’t look at me,” she teased. “Complain to Slappy.” 

Kris scowled. 

“You’re jealous,” Lindy said. “Because I found him and you didn’t.” 

Kris started to protest, but they both heard voices. Kris looked up to 
see the two Marshall kids from down the block running toward them. They 
were cute, red-headed kids that Lindy and Kris sometimes baby-sat for. 

“What’s that?” Amy Marshall asked, pointing at Slappy. 

“Does he talk?” her younger brother, Ben, asked, staying several feet 
away, an uncertain expression on his freckled face. 

“Hi, I’m Slappy!” Lindy made the dummy call out. She cradled Slappy 
in one arm, making him sit up straight, his arms dangling at his sides. 

“Where’d you get him?” Amy asked. 

“Do his eyes move?” Ben asked, still hanging back. 

“Do your eyes move?” Slappy asked Ben. 

Both Marshall kids laughed. Ben forgot his reluctance. He stepped up 
and grabbed Slappy’s hand. 

“Ouch! Not so hard!” Slappy cried. 

Ben dropped the hand with a gasp. Then he and Amy collapsed in 



gleeful laughter. 

“Ha-ha-ha-ha!” Lindy made Slappy laugh, tilting his head back and 
opening his mouth wide. 

The two kids thought that was a riot. They laughed even harder. 

Pleased by the response she was getting, Lindy glanced at her sister. 
Kris was sitting on the curb, cradling her head in her hands, a dejected look 
on her face. 

She’s jealous, Lindy realized. Kris sees that the kids really like Slappy 
and that I’m getting all the attention. And she’s totally jealous. 

I’m definitely keeping Slappy! Lindy told herself, secretly pleased at 
her little triumph. 

She stared into the dummy’s bright blue painted eyes. To her surprise, 
the dummy seemed to be staring back at her, a twinkle of sunlight in his 
eyes, his grin wide and knowing.

“Who was that on the phone?” Mr. Powell asked, shoveling another forkful 
of spaghetti into his mouth. 

Lindy slipped back into her place at the table. “It was Mrs. Marshall. 
Down the block.” 

“Does she want you to baby-sit?” Mrs. Powell asked, reaching for the 
salad bowl. She turned to Kris. “Don’t you want any salad?” 

Kris wiped spaghetti sauce off her chin with her napkin. “Maybe 
later.” 

“No,” Lindy answered. “She wants me to perform. At Amy’s birthday 
party. With Slappy.” 

“Your first job,” Mr. Powell said, a smile crossing his slender face. 

“Amy and Ben liked Slappy so much, they insisted on him,” Lindy 
said. “Mrs. Marshall is going to pay me twenty dollars.” 

“That’s great!” their mother exclaimed. She passed the salad bowl 
across the table to her husband. 

It had been a week since Lindy rescued Slappy from the trash 
Dumpster. Every day after school, she had spent hours up in her room 
rehearsing with him, working on his voice, practicing not moving her lips, 
thinking up jokes to perform with him. 

Kris kept insisting the whole thing was dumb. “I can’t believe you’re 
being such a nerd,” she told her sister. She refused to be an audience for 
Lindy’s routines. 

But when Lindy brought Slappy into school on Friday, Kris’ attitude 
began to change. A group of kids had gathered around Lindy outside her 
locker. 

As Lindy made Slappy talk for them, Kris watched from down the 
hall. She’s going to make a total fool of herself, Kris thought. 

But to her surprise, the kids hooted and howled. They thought Slappy 
was a riot. Even Robby Martin, the guy Kris had had a crush on for two 
years, thought Lindy was terrific. 

Watching Robby laugh along with the other kids made Kris think hard. 
Becoming a ventriloquist might be fun. 



And profitable. Lindy was going to earn twenty dollars at the 
Marshalls’ birthday party. And when word got around, she’d probably 
perform at a lot of parties and earn even more money. 

After dinner that evening, Lindy and Kris washed and dried the dishes. 
Then Lindy asked her parents if she could practice her new comedy routine 
on them. She hurried up to her room to get Slappy. 

Mr. and Mrs. Powell took a seat on the living room couch. “Maybe 
Lindy will be a TV star,” Mrs. Powell said. 

“Maybe,” Mr. Powell agreed, settling back on the couch, a pleased 
smile on his face. Barky yapped and climbed between Mr. and Mrs. Powell, 
his tiny stub of a tail wagging furiously. 

“You know you’re not allowed on the couch,” Mrs. Powell said, 
sighing. But she made no move to push Barky off. 

Kris sat down away from the others, on the floor by the steps, cradling 
her chin in her hands. 

“You’re looking glum this evening,” her father remarked. 

“Can I get a dummy, too?” Kris asked. She hadn’t really planned to 
say it. The question just popped out of her mouth. 

Lindy came back into the room, carrying Slappy around the waist. 
“Ready?” she asked. She pulled a dining room chair into the center of the 
living room and sat down on it. 

“Well, can I?” Kris repeated. 

“You really want one, too?” Mrs. Powell asked, surprised. 

“Want what?” Lindy asked, confused. 

“Kris says she wants a dummy, too,” Mrs. Powell reported. 

“No way,” Lindy said heatedly. “Why do you want to be such a 
copycat?” 

“It looks like fun,” Kris replied, her cheeks turning bright pink. “If you 
can do it, I can do it, too,” she added shrilly. 

“You always copy everything I do,” Lindy protested angrily. “Why 
don’t you find something of your own for once? Go upstairs and work on 
your junk jewelry collection. That’s your hobby. Let me be the 
ventriloquist.” 

“Girls”—Mr. Powell started, raising a hand for quiet—“please, don’t 
fight over a dummy.” 

“I really think I’d be better at it,” Kris said. “I mean, Lindy isn’t very 



funny.” 

“Everyone thinks I’m funny,” Lindy insisted. 

“That’s not very nice, Kris,” Mrs. Powell scolded. 

“Well, I just think if Lindy has one, I should be able to have one, too,” 
Kris said to her parents. 

“Copycat,” Lindy repeated, shaking her head. “You’ve been putting 
me down all week. You said it was nerdy. But I know why you changed 
your mind. You’re upset because I’m going to earn some money and you’re 
not.” 

“I really wish you two wouldn’t argue about everything,” Mr. Powell 
said disgustedly. 

“Well, can I have a dummy?” Kris asked him. 

“They’re expensive,” Mr. Powell replied, glancing at his wife. “A good 
one will cost more than a hundred dollars. I really don’t think we can afford 
to buy one now.” 

“Why don’t you both share Slappy?” Mrs. Powell suggested. 

“Huh?” Lindy’s mouth dropped open in protest. 

“You two always share everything,” Mrs. Powell continued. “So why 
don’t you share Slappy?” 

“But, Mom—” Lindy whined unhappily. 

“Excellent idea,” Mr. Powell interrupted. He motioned to Kris. “Try it 
out. After you share him for a while, I’m sure one of you will lose interest 
in him. Maybe even both of you.” 

Kris climbed to her feet and walked over to Lindy. She reached out for 
the dummy. “I don’t mind sharing,” she said quietly, searching her sister’s 
eyes for approval of the idea. “Can I hold him for just a second?” 

Lindy held onto Slappy tightly. 

Suddenly the dummy’s head tilted back and his mouth opened wide. 
“Beat it, Kris!” he snarled in a harsh raspy voice. “Get lost, you stupid 
moron!” 

Before Kris could back away, Slappy’s wooden hand shot up, and he 
slapped her hard across the face. 



4 


“Ow!” 

Kris screamed and raised her hand to her cheek, which was bright 
pink. She stepped back. “Stop it, Lindy! That hurt!” 

“Me?” Lindy cried. “I didn’t do it! Slappy did!” 

“Don’t be dumb,” Kris protested, rubbing her cheek. “You really hurt 

me.” 

“But I didn’t do it!” Lindy cried. She turned Slappy’s face toward her. 
“Why were you so rude to Kris?” 

Mr. Powell jumped up from the couch. “Stop acting dumb and 
apologize to your sister,” he ordered. 

Lindy bowed Slappy’s head. “I’m sorry,” she made the dummy say. 

“No. In your own voice,” Mr. Powell insisted, crossing his arms in 
front of his chest. “Slappy didn’t hurt Kris. You did.” 

“Okay, okay,” Lindy muttered, blushing. She avoided Kris’ angry 
stare. “I’m sorry. Here.” She dumped Slappy into Kris’ arms. 

Kris was so surprised, she nearly dropped the dummy. Slappy was 
heavier than she’d imagined. 

“Now what am I supposed to do with him?” Kris asked Lindy. 

Lindy shrugged and crossed the room to the couch, where she dropped 
down beside her mother. 

“Why’d you make such a fuss?” Mrs. Powell whispered, leaning close 
to Lindy. “That was so babyish.” 

Lindy blushed. “Slappy is mine! Why can’t something be mine for 
once?” 

“Sometimes you girls are so nice to each other, and sometimes...” 
Mrs. Powell’s voice trailed off. 

Mr. Powell took a seat on the padded arm of the chair across the room. 

“How do I make his mouth work?” Kris asked, tilting the dummy 
upside down to examine its back. 

“There’s a string in his back, inside the slit in his jacket,” Lindy told 
her grudgingly. “You just pull it.” 

I don’t want Kris to work Slappy, Lindy thought unhappily. 



I don’t want to share Slappy. 

Why can’t I have something that just belongs to me? Why do I have to 
share everything with her? 

Why does Kris always want to copy me? 

She gritted her teeth and waited for her anger to fade. 

Later that night, Kris sat straight up in bed. She’d had a bad dream. 

I was being chased, she remembered, her heart still pounding. Chased 
by what? By whom? 

She couldn’t remember. 

She glanced around the shadowy room, waiting for her heartbeat to 
return to normal. The room felt hot and stuffy, even though the window was 
open and the curtains were fluttering. 

Lindy lay sound asleep on her side in the twin bed next to Kris’. She 
was snoring softly, her lips slightly parted, her long hair falling loose about 
her face. 

Kris glanced at the clock-radio on the bed table between the two twin 
beds. It was nearly three in the morning. 

Even though she was now wide awake, the nightmare wouldn’t 
completely fade away. She still felt uncomfortable, a little frightened, as if 
she were still being chased by someone or something. The back of her neck 
felt hot and prickly. 

She turned and fluffed up her pillow, propping it higher on the 
headboard. As she lay back on it, something caught her eye. 

Someone sitting in the chair in front of the bedroom window. Someone 
staring at her. 

After a sharp intake of breath, she realized it was Slappy. 

Yellow moonlight poured over him, making his staring eyes glow. He 
was sitting up in the chair, tilted to the right at a slight angle, one arm 
resting on the slender arm of the chair. 

His mouth locked in a wide, mocking grin, his eyes seemed to be 
staring right at Kris. 

Kris stared back, studying the dummy’s expression in the eerie yellow 
moonlight. Then, without thinking, without even realizing what she was 
doing, she climbed silently out of bed. 

Her foot got tangled in the bedsheet and she nearly tripped. Kicking 



the sheet away, she made her way quickly across the room to the window. 

Slappy stared up at her as her shadow fell over him. His grin seemed 
to grow wider as Kris leaned closer. 

A gust of wind made the soft curtains flutter against her face. Kris 
pushed them away and peered down at the dummy’s painted head. 

She reached a hand out and rubbed his wooden hair, shining in the 
moonlight. His head felt warm, warmer than she’d imagined. 

Kris quickly jerked her hand away. 

What was that sound? 

Had Slappy snickered? Had he laughed at her? 

No. Of course not. 

Kris realized she was breathing hard. 

Why am I so freaked out by this stupid dummy? she thought. 

In the bed behind her, Lindy made a gurgling sound and rolled onto 
her back. 

Kris stared hard into Slappy’s big eyes, gleaming in the light from the 
window. She waited for him to blink or to roll his eyes from side to side. 

She suddenly felt foolish. 

He’s just a stupid wooden dummy, she told herself. 

She reached out and pushed him over. 

The stiff body swung to the side. The hard head made a soft clonk as it 
hit the wooden arm of the chair. 

Kris stared down at him, feeling strangely satisfied, as if she’d 
somehow taught him a lesson. 

The curtains rustled against her face again. She pushed them away. 

Feeling sleepy, she started back to bed. 

She had only gone one step when Slappy reached up and grabbed her 
wrist. 



5 


“Oh!” As the hand tightened around her wrist, Kris cried out and spun 
around. 

To her surprise, Lindy was crouched beside her. Lindy had a tight grip 
on Kris’ wrist. 

Kris jerked her hand from Lindy’s grasp. 

Moonlight through the window lit up Lindy’s devilish grin. “Gotcha 
again!” she declared. 

“You didn’t scare me!” Kris insisted. But her voice came out a 
trembling whisper. 

“You jumped a mile!” Lindy exclaimed gleefully. “You really thought 
the dummy grabbed you.” 

“Did not!” Kris replied. She hurried to her bed. 

“What were you doing up, anyway?” Lindy demanded. “Were you 
messing with Slappy?” 

“No. I... uh... had a bad dream,” Kris told her. “I just went to look out 
the window.” 

Lindy snickered. “You should’ve seen the look on your face.” 

“I’m going back to sleep. Leave me alone,” Kris snapped. She pulled 
the covers up to her chin. 

Lindy pushed the dummy back to a sitting position. Then she returned 
to her bed, still chuckling over the scare she’d given her sister. 

Kris rearranged her pillows, then glanced across the room to the 
window. The dummy’s face was half covered in shadow now. But the eyes 
glowed as if he were alive. And they stared into hers as if they were trying 
to tell her something. 

Why does he have to grin like that? Kris asked herself, trying to rub 
away the prickly feeling on the back of her neck. 

She pulled up the sheet, settled into the bed, and turned on her side, 
away from the wide, staring eyes. 

But even with her back turned, she could feel them gazing at her. Even 
with her eyes closed and the covers pulled up to her head, she could picture 
the shadowy, distorted grin, the unblinking eyes. Staring at her. Staring. 



Staring. 

She drifted into an uncomfortable sleep, drifted into another dark 
nightmare. Someone was chasing her. Someone very evil was chasing her. 

But who? 

On Monday afternoon, Lindy and Kris both stayed after school to rehearse 
for the spring concert. It was nearly five when they arrived home, and they 
were surprised to see their dad’s car in the driveway. 

“You’re home so early!” Kris exclaimed, finding him in the kitchen 
helping their mother prepare dinner. 

“I’m leaving tomorrow for a sales conference in Portland,” Mr. Powell 
explained, peeling an onion over the sink with a small paring knife. “So I 
only worked half a day today.” 

“What’s for dinner?” Lindy asked. 

“Meatloaf,” Mrs. Powell replied, “if your father ever gets the onion 
peeled.” 

“There’s a trick to not crying when you peel an onion,” Mr. Powell 
said, tears rolling down his cheeks. “Wish I knew it.” 

“How was chorus rehearsal?” Mrs. Powell asked, kneading a big ball 
of red ground beef in her hands. 

“Boring,” Lindy complained, opening the refrigerator and taking out a 
can of Coke. 

“Yeah. We’re doing all these Russian and Yugoslavian songs,” Kris 
said. “They’re so sad. They’re all about sheep or something. We don’t 
really know what they’re about. There’s no translation.” 

Mr. Powell mshed to the sink and began splashing cold water on his 
red, runny eyes. “I can’t take this!” he wailed. He tossed the half-peeled 
onion back to his wife. 

“Crybaby,” she muttered, shaking her head. 

Kris headed up the stairs to drop her backpack in her room. She tossed 
it onto the desk she shared with Lindy, then turned to go back downstairs. 

But something by the window caught her eye. 

Spinning around, she gasped. 

“Oh, no!” The startled cry escaped her lips. 

Kris raised her hands to her cheeks and stared in disbelief. 

Slappy was propped up in the chair in front of the window, grinning at 



her with his usual wide-eyed stare. And seated beside him was another 
dummy, also grinning at her. 

And they were holding hands. 

“What’s going on here?” Kris cried aloud.

“Do you like him?” 

At first, Kris thought that Slappy had asked the question. 

She gaped in stunned disbelief. 

“Well? What do you think of him?” 

It took Kris a long moment to realize that the voice was coming from 
behind her. She turned to find her father standing in the doorway, still 
dabbing at his eyes with a wet dishtowel. 

“The—the new dummy?” Kris stammered. 

“He’s for you,” Mr. Powell said, stepping into the room, the wet towel 
pressed against both eyes. 

“Really?” Kris hurried over to the chair and picked the new dummy up 
to examine him. 

“There’s a tiny pawnshop on the corner across from my office,” Mr. 
Powell said, lowering the towel. “I was walking past and, believe it or not, 
this guy was in the window. He was cheap, too. I think the pawnbroker was 
glad to get rid of him.” 

“He’s... cute,” Kris said, searching for the right word. “He looks just 
like Lindy’s dummy, except his hair is bright red, not brown.” 

“Probably made by the same company,” Mr. Powell said. 

“His clothes are better than Slappy’s,” Kris said, holding the dummy 
out at arm’s length to get a good view. “I hate that stupid gray suit on 
Lindy’s dummy.” 

The new dummy wore blue denim jeans and a red-and-green flannel 
shirt. And instead of the formal-looking, shiny brown shoes, he had white 
high-top sneakers on his feet. 

“So you like him?” Mr. Powell asked, smiling. 

“I love him!” Kris cried happily. She crossed the room and gave her 
dad a hug. 

Then she picked up the dummy and ran out of the room, down the 
stairs, and into the kitchen. “Hey, everybody! Meet Mr. Wood!” she 
declared happily, holding the grinning dummy up in front of her. 

Barky yapped excitedly, leaping up to nip at the dummy’s sneakers. 



Kris pulled her dummy away. 

“Hey!” Lindy cried in surprise. “Where’d you get that?” 

“From Daddy,” Kris said, her grin wider than the dummy’s. “I’m going 
to start practicing with him after dinner, and I’m going to be a better 
ventriloquist than you.” 

“Kris!” Mrs. Powell scolded. “Everything isn’t a competition, you 
know!” 

“I already have a job with Slappy,” Lindy said with a superior sneer. 
“And you’re just getting started. You’re just a beginner.” 

“Mr. Wood is much better-looking than Slappy,” Kris said, mirroring 
her twin’s sneer. “Mr. Wood is cool-looking. That gray suit on your dummy 
is the pits.” 

“You think that ratty old shirt is cool-looking?” Lindy scoffed, making 
a disgusted face. “Yuck. That old dummy probably has worms!” 

“You have worms!” Kris exclaimed. 

“Your dummy won’t be funny,” Lindy said nastily, “because you don’t 
have a sense of humor.” 

“Oh, yeah?” Kris replied, tossing Mr. Wood over her shoulder. “I must 
have a sense of humor. I put up with you, don’t I?” 

“Copycat! Copycat!” Lindy cried angrily. 

“Out of the kitchen!” Mrs. Powell ordered with an impatient shriek. 
“Out! Get out! You two are impossible! The dummies have better 
personalities than either of you!” 

“Thanks, Mom,” Kris said sarcastically. 

“Call me for dinner,” Lindy called back. “I’m going upstairs to 
practice my act with Slappy for the birthday party on Saturday.” 

It was the next afternoon, and Kris was sitting at the dressing table she 
shared with Lindy. Kris rummaged in the jewelry box and pulled out 
another string of brightly colored beads. She slipped them over her head 
and untangled them from the other three strands of beads she was wearing. 
Then she gazed at herself in the mirror, shaking her head to better see the 
long, dangly earrings. 

I love my junk jewelry collection, she thought, digging into the depths 
of the wooden jewelry box to see what other treasures she could pull out. 

Lindy had no interest in the stuff. But Kris could spend hours trying on 



the beads, fingering the dozens of little charms, running her fingers over the 
plastic bracelets, jangling the earrings. Her jewelry collection always 
cheered her up. 

She shook her head again, making the long earrings jangle. A knock on 
the bedroom door made her spin around. 

“Hey, Kris, how’s it going?” Her friend Cody Matthews stepped into 
the room. He had straight, white-blond hair, and pale gray eyes in a slender, 
serious face. Cody always looked as if he were deep in thought. 

“You ride your bike over?” Kris asked, removing several strands of 
beads at once and tossing them into the jewelry box. 

“No. Walked,” Cody replied. “Why’d you call? You just want to hang 
out?” 

“No.” Kris jumped to her feet. She walked over to the chair by the 
window and grabbed up Mr. Wood. “I want to practice my act.” 

Cody groaned. “I’m the guinea pig?” 

“No. The audience. Come on.” 

She led him out to the bent old maple tree in the middle of her back 
yard. The afternoon sun was just beginning to lower itself in the clear, 
spring-blue sky. 

She raised one foot against the tree trunk and propped Mr. Wood on 
her knee. Cody sprawled on his back in the shade. “Tell me if this is funny,” 
she instructed. 

“Okay. Shoot,” Cody replied, narrowing his eyes in concentration. 

Kris turned Mr. Wood to face her. “How are you today?” she asked 

him. 

“Pretty good. Knock wood,” she made the dummy say. 

She waited for Cody to laugh, but he didn’t. “Was that funny?” she 
asked. 

“Kinda,” he replied without enthusiasm. “Keep going.” 

“Okay.” Kris lowered her head so that she was face-to-face with her 
dummy. “Mr. Wood,” she said, “why were you standing in front of the 
mirror with your eyes closed?” 

“Well,” answered the dummy in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, “I 
wanted to see what I look like when I’m asleep!” 

Kris tilted the dummy’s head back and made him look as if he were 
laughing. “How about that joke?” she asked Cody. 



Cody shrugged. “Better, I guess.” 

“Aw, you’re no help!” Kris screamed angrily. She lowered her arms, 
and Mr. Wood crumpled onto her lap. “You’re supposed to tell me if it’s 
funny or not.” 

“I guess not, ” Cody said thoughtfully. 

Kris groaned. “I need some good joke books,” she said. “That’s all. 
Some good joke books with some really funny jokes. Then I’d be ready to 
perform. Because I’m a pretty good ventriloquist, right?” 

“I guess,” Cody replied, pulling up a handful of grass and letting the 
moist, green blades sift through his fingers. 

“Well, I don’t move my lips very much, do I ?” Kris demanded. 

“Not too much,” Cody allowed. “But you don’t really throw your 
voice.” 

“No one can throw her voice,” Kris told him. “It’s just an illusion. You 
make people think you’re throwing your voice. You don’t really throw it.” 

“Oh,” Cody said, pulling up another handful of grass. 

Kris tried out several more jokes. “What do you think?” she asked 
Cody. 

“I think I have to go home,” Cody said. He tossed a handful of grass at 
her. 

Kris brushed the green blades off Mr. Wood’s wooden head. She 
mbbed her hand gently over the dummy’s painted red hair. “You’re hurting 
Mr. Wood’s feelings,” she told Cody. 

Cody climbed to his feet. “Why do you want to mess with that thing, 
anyway?” he asked, pushing his white-blond hair back off his forehead. 

“Because it’s fun,” Kris replied. 

“Is that the real reason?” Cody demanded. 

“Well... I guess I want to show Lindy that I’m better at it than she is.” 

“You two are weird!” Cody declared. “See you in school.” He gave 
her a little wave, then turned and headed for his home down the block. 

Kris pulled down the blankets and climbed into bed. Pale moonlight filtered 
in through the bedroom window. 

Yawning, she glanced at the clock-radio. Nearly ten. She could hear 
Lindy brushing her teeth in the bathroom across the hall. 

Why does Lindy always hum when she brushes her teeth? Kris 



wondered. How can one twin sister do so many annoying things? 

She gave Mr. Wood one last glance. He was propped in the chair in 
front of the window, his hands carefully placed in his lap, his white 
sneakers hanging over the chair edge. 

He looks like a real person, Kris thought sleepily. 

Tomorrow I’m going to check out some good joke books from the 
library at school. I can be funnier than Lindy. I know I can. 

She settled back sleepily on her pillow. I’ll be asleep as soon as we 
turn off the lights, she thought. 

A few seconds later, Lindy entered the room, wearing her nightshirt 
and carrying Slappy under one arm. “You asleep?” she asked Kris. 

“Almost,” Kris replied, yawning loudly. “I’ve been studying for the 
math final all night. Where’ve you been?” 

“Over at Alice’s,” Lindy told her, setting Slappy down in the chair 
beside Mr. Wood. “Some kids were over, and I practiced my act for them. 
They laughed so hard, I thought they’d split a gut. When Slappy and I did 
our rap routine, Alice spit her chocolate milk out her nose. What a riot!” 

“That’s nice,” Kris said without enthusiasm. “Guess you and Slappy 
are ready for Amy’s birthday party on Saturday.” 

“Yeah,” Lindy replied. She placed Slappy’s arm around Mr. Wood’s 
shoulder. “They look so cute together,” she said. Then she noticed the 
clothing neatly draped over the desk chair. “What’s that?” she asked Kris. 

Kris raised her head from the pillow to see what her sister was 
pointing at. “My outfit for tomorrow,” she told her. “We’re having a dress- 
up party in Miss Finch’s class. It’s a farewell party. For Margot. You know. 
The student teacher.” 

Lindy stared at the clothes. “Your Betsey Johnson skirt? Your silk 
blouse?” 

“We’re supposed to get really dressed up,” Kris said, yawning. “Can 
we go to sleep now?” 

“Yeah. Sure.” Lindy made her way to her bed, sat down, and clicked 
off the bed-table lamp. “Are you getting any better with Mr. Wood?” she 
asked, climbing between the sheets. 

Kris was stung by the question. It was such an obvious put-down. 
“Yeah. I’m getting really good. I did some stuff for Cody. Out in the back 
yard. Cody laughed so hard, he couldn’t breathe. Really. He was holding his 



sides. He said Mr. Wood and I should be on TV.” 

“Really?” Lindy replied after a long moment’s hesitation. “That’s 
weird. I never thought Cody had much of a sense of humor. He’s always so 
grim. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him laugh.” 

“Well, he was laughing at Mr. Wood and me,” Kris insisted, wishing 
she were a better liar. 

“Awesome,” Lindy muttered. “I can’t wait to see your act.” 

Neither can I, Kris thought glumly. 

A few seconds later, they were both asleep. 

Their mother’s voice, calling from downstairs, awoke them at seven the 
next morning. Bright, morning-orange sunlight poured in through the 
window. Kris could hear birds chirping happily in the old maple tree. 

“Rise and shine! Rise and shine!” Every morning, Mrs. Powell shouted 
up the same words. 

Kris mbbed the sleep from her eyes, then stretched her arms high over 
her head. She glanced across the room, then uttered a quiet gasp. “Hey— 
what’s going on?” She reached across to Lindy’s bed and shook Lindy by 
the shoulder. “What’s going on?” 

“Huh?” Lindy, startled, sat straight up. 

“What’s the joke? Where is he?” Kris demanded. 

“Huh?” 

Kris pointed to the chair across the room. 

Sitting straight up in the chair, Slappy grinned back at them, bathed in 
morning sunlight. 

But Mr. Wood was gone.

Kris blinked several times and pushed herself up in bed with both hands. 
Her left hand tingled. She must have been sleeping on it, she realized. 

“What? What’s wrong?” Lindy asked, her voice fogged with sleep. 

“Where’s Mr. Wood?” Kris demanded impatiently. “Where’d you put 
him?” 

“Huh? Put him?” Lindy struggled to focus her eyes. She saw Slappy 
sitting stiffly on the chair across the room. By himself. 

“It’s not funny,” Kris snapped. She climbed out of bed, pulled down 
the hem of her nightshirt, and made her way quickly to the chair in front of 
the window. “Don’t you ever get tired of playing stupid jokes?” 

“Jokes? Huh?” Lindy lowered her feet to the floor. 

Kris bent down to search the floor under the chair. Then she moved to 
the foot of the bed and got down on her knees to search under both twin 
beds. 

“Where is he, Lindy?” she asked angrily, on her knees at the foot of 
the bed. “I don’t think this is funny. I really don’t.” 

“Well, neither do I,” Lindy insisted, standing up and stretching. 

Kris climbed to her feet. Her eyes went wide as she spotted the 
missing dummy. 

“Oh!” 

Lindy followed her sister’s startled gaze. 

Mr. Wood grinned at them from the doorway. He appeared to be 
standing, his skinny legs bent at an awkward angle. 

He was wearing Kris’ dress-up clothes, the Betsey Johnson skirt and 
the silk blouse. 

Her mouth wide open in surprise, Kris made her way quickly to the 
doorway. She immediately saw that the dummy wasn’t really standing on 
his own. He had been propped up, the doorknob shoved into the opening in 
his back. 

She grabbed the dummy by the waist and pulled him away from the 
door. “My blouse. It’s all wrinkled,” she cried, holding it so Lindy could 
see. She narrowed her eyes angrily at her sister. “This was so obnoxious of 



you, Lindy.” 

“Me?” Lindy shrieked. “I swear, Kris, I didn’t do it. I slept like a rock 
last night. I didn’t move. I didn’t get up till you woke me. I didn’t do it. 
Really!” 

Kris stared hard at her sister, then lowered her eyes to the dummy. 

In her blouse and skirt, Mr. Wood grinned up at her, as if enjoying her 
bewilderment. 

“Well, Mr. Wood,” Kris said aloud, “I guess you put on my clothes and 
walked to the door all by yourself!” 

Lindy started to say something. But their mother’s voice from 
downstairs interrupted. “Are you girls going to school today? Where are 
you? You’re late!” 

“Coming!” Kris called down, casting an angry glance at Lindy. She 
carefully set Mr. Wood down on his back on her bed and pulled her skirt 
and blouse off him. She looked up to see Lindy making a mad dash across 
the hall to be first in the bathroom. 

Sighing, Kris stared down at Mr. Wood. The dummy grinned up at her, 
a mischievous grin. 

“Well? What’s going on?” she asked the dummy. “I didn’t dress you 
up and move you. And Lindy swears she didn’t do it.” 

But if we didn’t do it, she thought, who did?

“Tilt his head forward,” Lindy instructed. “That’s it. If you bounce him up 
and down a little, it’ll make it look like he’s laughing.” 

Kris obediently bounced Mr. Wood on her lap, making him laugh. 

“Don’t move his mouth so much,” Lindy told her. 

“I think you’re both crazy,” Lindy’s friend Alice said. 

“So what else is new?” Cody joked. 

All four of them were sitting in a small patch of shade under the bent 
old maple tree in the Powells’ back yard. It was a hot Saturday afternoon, 
the sun high in a pale blue sky, streaks of yellow light filtering down 
through the shifting leaves above their heads. 

Barky sniffed busily around the yard, his little tail wagging nonstop. 

Kris sat on a folding chair, which leaned back against the gnarled tree 
trunk. She had Mr. Wood on her lap. 

Lindy and Alice stood at the edge of the shade, their hands crossed 
over their chests, watching Kris’ performance with frowns of concentration 
on their faces. 

Alice was a tall, skinny girl, with straight black hair down to her 
shoulders, a snub nose, and a pretty, heart-shaped mouth. She was wearing 
white shorts and a bright blue midriff top. 

Cody was sprawled on his back in the grass, his hands behind his head, 
a long blade of grass between his teeth. 

Kris was trying to show off her ventriloquist skills. But Lindy kept 
interrupting with “helpful” suggestions. When she wasn’t making 
suggestions, Lindy was nervously glancing at her watch. She didn’t want to 
be late for her job at Amy’s birthday party at two o’clock. 

“I think you’re way weird,” Alice told Lindy. 

“Hey, no way,” Lindy replied. “Slappy is a lot of fun. And I’m going 
to make a lot of money with him. And maybe I’ll be a comedy star or 
something when I’m older.” She glanced at her watch again. 

“Well, everyone at school thinks that both of you are weird,” Alice 
said, swatting a fly off her bare arm. 

“Who cares?” Lindy replied sharply. “They’re all weird, too.” 



“And so are you,” Kris made Mr. Wood say. 

“I could see your lips move,” Lindy told Kris. 

Kris rolled her eyes. “Give me a break. You’ve been giving me a hard 
time all morning.” 

“Just trying to help,” Lindy said. “You don’t have to be so defensive, 
do you?” 

Kris uttered an angry growl. 

“Was that your stomach?” she made Mr. Wood say. 

Cody laughed. 

“At least one person thinks you’re funny,” Lindy said dryly. “But if 
you want to do parties, you really should get some better jokes.” 

Kris let the dummy slump to her lap. “I can’t find any good joke 
books,” she said dejectedly. “Where do you find your jokes?” 

A superior sneer formed on Lindy’s face. She tossed her long hair 
behind her shoulder. “I make up my own jokes,” she replied snootily. 

“You are a joke!” Cody said. 

“Ha-ha. Remind me to laugh later,” Lindy said sarcastically. 

“I can’t believe you don’t have your dummy out here,” Alice told 
Lindy. “I mean, don’t you want to rehearse for the party?” 

“No need,” Lindy replied. “I’ve got my act down. I don’t want to over¬ 
rehearse.” 

Kris groaned loudly. 

“Some of the other parents are staying at the birthday party to watch 
Slappy and me,” Lindy continued, ignoring Kris’ sarcasm. “If the kids like 
me, their parents might hire me for their parties.” 

“Maybe you and Kris should do an act together,” Alice suggested. 
“That could be really awesome.” 

“Yeah. What an act! Then there’d be four dummies!” Cody joked. 

Alice was the only one to laugh. 

Lindy made a face at Cody. “That might actually be fun,” she said 
thoughtfully. And then she added, “When Kris is ready.” 

Kris drew in her breath and prepared to make an angry reply. 

But before she could say anything, Lindy grabbed Mr. Wood from her 
hands. “Let me give you a few pointers,” Lindy said, putting one foot on 
Kris’ folding chair and arranging Mr. Wood on her lap. “You have to hold 
him up straighter, like this.” 



“Hey—give him back,” Kris demanded, reaching for her dummy. 

As she reached up, Mr. Wood suddenly lowered his head until he was 
staring down at her. “You’re a jerk!” he rasped in Kris’ face, speaking in a 
low, throaty growl. 

“Huh?” Kris pulled back in surprise. 

“You’re a stupid jerk!” Mr. Wood repeated nastily in the same harsh 
growl. 

“Lindy—stop it!” Kris cried. 

Cody and Alice both stared in openmouthed surprise. 

“Stupid moron! Get lost! Get lost, stupid jerk!” the dummy rasped in 
Kris’ face. 

“Whoa!” Cody exclaimed. 

“Make him stop!” Kris screamed at her sister. 

“I can’t!” Lindy cried in a trembling voice. Her face became pale, her 
eyes wide with fear. “I can’t make him stop, Kris! He—he’s speaking for 
himself!” 



9 


The dummy glared at Kris, its grin ugly and evil. 

“I—I can’t make him stop. I’m not doing it,” Lindy cried. Tugging 
with all her might, she pulled Mr. Wood out of Kris’ face. 

Cody and Alice flashed each other bewildered glances. 

Frightened, Kris raised herself from the folding chair and backed up 
against the tree trunk. “He—he’s talking on his own?” She stared hard at 
the grinning dummy. 

“I—I think so. I’m... all mixed up!” Lindy declared, her cheeks bright 

pink. 

Barky yipped and jumped on Lindy’s legs, trying to get her attention. 
But she kept her gaze on Kris’ frightened face. 

“This is a joke—right?” Cody asked hopefully. 

“What’s going on?” Alice demanded, her arms crossed in front of her 
chest. 

Ignoring them, Lindy handed Mr. Wood back to Kris. “Here. Take 
him. He’s yours. Maybe you can control him.” 

“But, Lindy—” Kris started to protest. 

Lindy glared at her watch. “Oh, no! The party! I’m late!” Shaking her 
head, she took off toward the house. “Later!” she called without looking 
back. 

“But Lindy—” Kris called. 

The kitchen door slammed behind Lindy. 

Holding Mr. Wood by the shoulders, Kris lowered her eyes to his face. 
He grinned up at her, a devilish grin, his eyes staring intently into hers. 

Kris swung easily, leaning back and raising her feet into the air. The chains 
squeaked with every swing. The old back yard swingset, half covered with 
mst, hadn’t been used much in recent years. 

The early evening sun was lowering itself behind the house. The 
aroma of a roasting chicken floated out from the kitchen window. Kris 
could hear her mother busy in the kitchen preparing dinner. 

Barky yapped beneath her. Kris dropped her feet to the ground and 



stopped the swing to avoid kicking him. “Dumb dog. Don’t you know you 
could get hurt?” 

She looked up to see Lindy come running up the driveway, holding 
Slappy under her arm. From the smile on Lindy’s face, Kris knew at once 
that the birthday party had been a triumph. But she had to ask anyway. 
“How’d it go?” 

“It was awesome!” Lindy exclaimed. “Slappy and I were great'.” 

Kris pulled herself off the swing and forced a smile to her face. “That’s 
nice,” she offered. 

“The kids thought we were a riot!” Lindy continued. She pulled 
Slappy up. “Didn’t they, Slappy?” 

“They liked me. Hated you!” Slappy declared in Lindy’s high-pitched 
voice. 

Kris forced a laugh. “I’m glad it went okay,” she said, trying hard to be 
a good sport. 

“I did a sing-along with Slappy, and it went over really well. Then 
Slappy and I did our rap routine. What a hit!” Lindy gushed. 

She’s spreading it on a little thick, Kris thought bitterly. Kris couldn’t 
help feeling jealous. 

“The kids all lined up to talk to Slappy,” Lindy continued. “Didn’t 
they, Slappy?” 

“Everyone loved me,” she made the dummy say. “Where’s my share of 
the loot?” 

“So you got paid twenty dollars?” Kris asked, kicking at a clump of 
weeds. 

“Twenty-five,” Lindy replied. “Amy’s mom said I was so good, she’d 
pay me extra. Oh. And guess what else? You know Mrs. Evans? The 
woman who always wears the leopardskin pants? You know—Anna’s 
mom? She asked me to do Anna’s party next Sunday. She’s going to pay me 
thirty dollars! I’m going to be rich!” 

“Wow. Thirty dollars,” Kris muttered, shaking her head. 

“I get twenty. You get ten,” Lindy made Slappy say. 

“I have to go tell Mom the good news!” Lindy said. “What have you 
been doing all afternoon?” 

“Well, after you left, I was pretty upset,” Kris replied, following Lindy 
to the house. “You know. About Mr. Wood. I—I put him upstairs. Alice and 



Cody went home. Then Mom and I went to the mall.” 

His tail wagging furiously, Barky ran right over their feet, nearly 
tripping both of them. “Barky, look out!” Lindy yelled. 

“Oh. I nearly forgot,” Kris said, stopping on the back stoop. 
“Something good happened.” 

Lindy stopped, too. “Something good?” 

“Yeah. I ran into Mrs. Berman at the mall.” Mrs. Berman was their 
music teacher and organizer of the spring concert. 

“Thrills,” Lindy replied sarcastically. 

“And Mrs. Berman asked if Mr. Wood and I wanted to be master of 
ceremonies for the spring concert.” Kris smiled at her sister. 

Lindy swallowed hard. “She asked you to host the concert?” 

“Yeah. I get to perform with Mr. Wood in front of everyone!” Kris 
gushed happily. She saw a flash of jealousy on Lindy’s face, which made 
her even happier. 

Lindy pulled open the screen door. “Well, good luck,” she said dryly. 
“With that weird dummy of yours, you’ll need it.” 

Dinner was spent talking about Lindy’s performance at Amy Marshall’s 
birthday party. Lindy and Mrs. Powell chatted excitedly. Kris ate in silence. 

“At first I thought the whole thing was strange, I have to admit,” Mrs. 
Powell said, scooping ice cream into bowls for dessert. “I just couldn’t 
believe you’d be interested in ventriloquism, Lindy. But I guess you have a 
flair for it. I guess you have some talent.” 

Lindy beamed. Mrs. Powell normally wasn’t big on compliments. 

“I found a book in the school library about ventriloquism,” Lindy said. 
“It had some pretty good tips in it. It even had a comedy routine to 
perform.” She glanced at Kris. “But I like making up my own jokes better.” 

“You should watch your sister’s act,” Mrs. Powell told Kris, handing 
her a bowl of ice cream. “I mean, you could probably pick up some pointers 
for the concert at school.” 

“Maybe,” Kris replied, trying to hide how annoyed she was. 

After dinner, Mr. Powell called from Portland, and they all talked with 
him. Lindy told him about her success with Slappy at the birthday party. 
Kris told him about being asked to host the concert with Mr. Wood. Her 
father promised he wouldn’t schedule any road trips so that he could attend 



the concert. 

After watching a video their mother had rented at the mall, the two 
sisters went up to their room. It was a little after eleven. 

Kris clicked on the light. Lindy followed her in. 

They both glanced across the room to the chair where they kept the 
two dummies—and gasped. 

“Oh, no!” Lindy cried, raising one hand to her wide open mouth. 

Earlier that night, the dummies had been placed side by side in a 
sitting position. 

But now Slappy was upside down, falling out of the chair, his head on 
the floor. His brown shoes had been pulled off his feet and tossed against 
the wall. His suit jacket had been pulled halfway down his arms, trapping 
his hands behind his back. 

“L-look!” Kris stammered, although her sister was already staring in 
horror at the scene. “Mr. Wood—he’s...” Kris’ voice caught in her throat. 

Mr. Wood was sprawled on top of Slappy. His hands were wrapped 
around Slappy’s throat, as if he were strangling him. 



10 


“I—I don’t believe this!” Kris managed to whisper. She turned and caught 
the frightened expression on Lindy’s face. 

“What’s going on?” Lindy cried. 

Both sisters hurried across the room. Kris grabbed Mr. Wood by the 
back of the neck and pulled him off the other dummy. She felt as if she 
were separating two fighting boys. 

She held Mr. Wood up in front of her, examining him carefully, staring 
at his face as if half-expecting him to talk to her. 

Then she lowered the dummy and tossed it facedown onto her bed. 
Her face was pale and taut with fear. 

Lindy stooped and picked up Slappy’s brown shoes from the floor. She 
held them up and studied them, as if they would offer a clue as to what had 
happened. 

“Kris—did you do this?” Lindy asked softly. 

“Huh? Me?” Kris reacted with surprise. 

“I mean, I know you’re jealous of Slappy and me—” Lindy started. 

“Whoa. Wait a minute,” Kris replied angrily in a shrill, trembling 
voice. “I didn’t do this, Lindy. Don’t accuse me.” 

Lindy glared at her sister, studying her face. Then her expression 
softened and she sighed. “I don’t get. I just don’t get it. Look at Slappy. 
He’s nearly been torn apart.” 

She set the shoes down on the chair and picked the dummy up gently 
as if picking up a baby. Holding him in one hand, she struggled to pull his 
suit jacket up with the other. 

Kris heard her sister mutter something. It sounded like “Your dummy 
is evil.” 

“What did you say?” Kris demanded. 

“Nothing,” Lindy replied, still struggling with the jacket. “I’m... uh... 
I’m kind of scared about this,” Lindy confessed, blushing, avoiding Kris’ 
eyes. 

“Me, too,” Kris admitted. “Something weird is going on. I think we 
should tell Mom.” 



Lindy buttoned the jacket. Then she sat down on the bed with Slappy 
on her lap and started to replace the dummy’s shoes. “Yeah. I guess we 
should,” she replied. “It—it’s just so creepy.” 

Their mother was in bed, reading a Stephen King novel. Her bedroom 
was dark except for a tiny reading lamp on her headboard that threw down a 
narrow triangle of yellow light. 

Mrs. Powell uttered a short cry as her two daughters appeared out of 
the shadows. “Oh. You startled me. This is such a scary book, and I think I 
was just about to fall asleep.” 

“Can we talk to you?” Kris asked eagerly in a low whisper. 

“Something weird is going on,” Lindy added. 

Mrs. Powell yawned and closed her book. “What’s wrong?” 

“It’s about Mr. Wood,” Kris said. “He’s been doing a lot of strange 
things.” 

“Huh?” Mrs. Powell’s eyes opened wide. She looked pale and tired 
under the harsh light from the reading lamp. 

“He was strangling Slappy,” Lindy reported. “And this afternoon, he 
said some really gross things. And—” 

“Stop!” Mrs. Powell ordered, raising one hand. “Just stop.” 

“But, Mom—” Kris started. 

“Give me a break, girls,” their mother said wearily. “I’m tired of your 
silly competitions.” 

“You don’t understand,” Lindy interrupted. 

“Yes, I do understand,” Mrs. Powell said sharply. “You two are even 
competing with those ventriloquist dummies.” 

“Mom, please!” 

“I want it to stop right now,” Mrs. Powell insisted, tossing the book 
onto her bed table. “I mean it. I don’t want to hear another word from either 
of you about those dummies. If you two have problems, settle it between 
yourselves.” 

“Mom, listen—” 

“And if you can’t settle it, I’ll take the dummies away. Both of them. 
I’m serious.” Mrs. Powell reached above her head and clicked off the 
reading light, throwing the room into darkness. “Good night,” she said. 

The girls had no choice but to leave the room. They slunk down the 
hall in silence. 



Kris hesitated at the doorway to their bedroom. She expected to find 
Mr. Wood strangling Slappy again. She breathed a sigh of relief when she 
saw the two dummies on the bed where they had been left. 

“Mom wasn’t too helpful,” Lindy said dryly, rolling her eyes. She 
picked up Slappy and started to arrange him in the chair in front of the 
window. 

“I think she was asleep and we woke her up,” Kris replied. 

She picked up Mr. Wood and started toward the chair with him—then 
stopped. “You know what? I think I’m going to put him in the closet 
tonight,” she said thoughtfully. 

“Good idea,” Lindy said, climbing into bed. 

Kris glanced down at the dummy, half-expecting him to react. To 
complain. To start calling her names. 

But Mr. Wood grinned up at her, his painted eyes dull and lifeless. 

Kris felt a chill of fear. 

I’m becoming afraid of a stupid ventriloquist’s dummy, she thought. 

I’m shutting him up in the closet tonight because I’m afraid. 

She carried Mr. Wood to the closet. Then, with a groan, she raised him 
high above her head and slid him onto the top shelf. Carefully closing the 
closet door, listening for the click, she made her way to her bed. 

She slept fitfully, tossing on top of the covers, her sleep filled with 
disturbing dreams. She awoke to find her nightshirt completely twisted, 
cutting off the circulation to her right arm. She struggled to straighten it, 
then fell back to sleep. 

She awoke early, drenched in sweat. The sky was still dawn-gray outside 
the window. 

The room felt hot and stuffy. She sat up slowly, feeling weary, as if she 
hadn’t slept at all. 

Blinking away the sleep, her eyes focused on the chair in front of the 
window. 

There sat Slappy, exactly where Lindy had placed him. 

And beside him sat Mr. Wood, his arm around Slappy’s shoulder, 
grinning triumphantly at Kris as if he had just pulled off a wonderful joke.

“Now, Mr. Wood, do you go to school?” 

“Of course I do. Do you think I’m a dummy?” 

“And what’s your favorite class?” 

“Wood shop, of course!” 

“What project are you building in shop class, Mr. Wood?” 

“I’m building a girl dummy! What else? Ha-ha! Think I want to spend 
the rest of my life on your lap?!” 

Kris sat in front of the dressing table mirror with Mr. Wood on her lap, 
studying herself as she practiced her routine for the school concert. 

Mr. Wood had been well-behaved for two days. No frightening, 
mysterious incidents. Kris was beginning to feel better. Maybe everything 
would go okay from now on. 

She leaned close to the mirror, watching her lips as she made the 
dummy talk. 

The b’s and the m’s were impossible to pronounce without moving her 
lips. She’d just have to avoid those sounds as best she could. 

I’m getting better at switching from Mr. Wood’s voice back to mine, 
she thought happily. But I’ve got to switch faster. The faster he and I talk, 
the funnier it is. 

“Let’s try it again, Mr. Wood,” she said, pulling her chair closer to the 
mirror. 

“Work, work, work,” she made the dummy grumble. 

Before she could begin the routine, Lindy came rushing breathlessly 
into the room. Kris watched her sister in the mirror as she came up behind 
her, her long hair flying loosely over her shoulders, an excited smile on her 
face. 

“Guess what?” Lindy asked. 

Kris started to reply, but Lindy didn’t give her a chance. 

“Mrs. Petrie was at Amy Marshall’s birthday party,” Lindy gushed 
excitedly. “She works for Channel Three. You know. The TV station. And 
she thinks I’m good enough to go on Talent Search, the show they have 
every week.” 



“Huh? Really?” was all Kris could manage in reply. 

Lindy leapt excitedly in the air and cheered. “Slappy and I are going to 
be on TV!” she cried. “Isn’t that fabulous ?” 

Staring at her sister’s jubilant reflection in the mirror, Kris felt a stab 
of jealousy. 

“I’ve got to tell Mom!” Lindy declared. “Hey, Mom! Mom!” She ran 
from the room. Kris heard her shouting all the way down the stairs. 

“Aaaaaargh!” Kris couldn’t hold it in. She uttered an angry cry. 

“Why does everything good happen to Lindy?” Kris screamed aloud. 
“I’m hosting a stupid concert for maybe a hundred parents—and she’s 
going to be on TV! I’m just as good as she is. Maybe better!” 

In a rage, she raised Mr. Wood high over her head and slammed him to 
the floor. 

The dummy’s head made a loud clonk as it hit the hardwood floor. The 
wide mouth flew open as if about to scream. 

“Oh.” Kris struggled to regain her composure. 

Mr. Wood, crumpled at her feet, stared up at her accusingly. 

Kris lifted him up and cradled the dummy against her. “There, there, 
Mr. Wood,” she whispered soothingly. “Did I hurt you? Did I? I’m so sorry. 
I didn’t mean to.” 

The dummy continued to stare up at her. His painted grin hadn’t 
changed, but his eyes seemed cold and unforgiving. 

It was a still night. No breeze. The curtains in front of the open bedroom 
window didn’t flutter or move. Pale silver moonlight filtered in, creating 
long, purple shadows that appeared to creep across the girls’ bedroom. 

Lindy had been sleeping fitfully, a light sleep filled with busy, colorful 
dreams. She was startled awake by a sound. A gentle thud. 

“Huh?” she raised her head from the damp pillow and turned. 

Someone was moving in the darkness. 

The sounds she’d heard were footsteps. 

“Hey!” she whispered, wide awake now. “Who is it?” 

The figure turned in the doorway, a shadow against even blacker 
shadows. “It’s only me,” came a whispered reply. 

“Kris?” 

“Yeah. Something woke me up. My throat is sore,” Kris whispered 



from the doorway. “I’m going down to the kitchen for a glass of water.” 

She disappeared into the shadows. Her head still raised off the pillow, 
Lindy listened to her footsteps padding down the stairs. 

When the sounds faded, Lindy shut her eyes and lowered her head to 
the pillow. 

A few seconds later, she heard Kris’ scream of horror. 



12 


Her heart pounding, Lindy struggled out of bed. The sheet tangled around 
her legs, and she nearly fell. 

Kris’ bloodcurdling scream echoed in her ears. 

She practically leapt down the dark stairway, her bare feet thudding 
hard on the thin carpet of the steps. 

It was dark downstairs, except for a thin sliver of yellow light from the 
kitchen. 

“Kris—Kris—are you okay?” Lindy called, her voice sounding small 
and frightened in the dark hallway. 

“Kris?” 

Lindy stopped at the kitchen doorway. 

What was that eerie light? 

It took her a while to focus. Then she realized she was staring at the 
dim yellow light from inside the refrigerator. 

The refrigerator door was wide open. 

And... the refrigerator was empty. 

“What—what’s going on here?” 

She took a step into the kitchen. Then another. 

Something cold and wet surrounded her foot. 

Lindy gasped and, looking down, saw that she had stepped into a wide 
puddle. 

An overturned milk carton beside her foot revealed that the puddle was 
spilled milk. 

She raised her eyes to Kris, who was standing in darkness across the 
room, her back against the wall, her hands raised to her face in horror. 

“Kris, what on earth—” 

The scene was coming into focus now. It was all so weird, so... wrong. 
It was taking Lindy a long time to see the whole picture. 

But, now, following Kris’ horrified stare, Lindy saw the mess on the 
floor. And realized why the refrigerator was empty. 

Everything inside it had been pulled out and dumped on the kitchen 



floor. An orange juice bottle lay on its side in a puddle of orange juice. 
Eggs were scattered everywhere. Fruits and vegetables were strewn over 
the floor. 

“Ohh!” Lindy moaned in utter disbelief. 

Everything seemed to sparkle and gleam. 

What was all that shiny stuff among the food? 

Kris’jewelry! 

There were earrings and bracelets and strands of beads tossed 
everywhere, mixed with the spilled, strewn food like some kind of bizarre 
salad. 

“Oh, no!” Lindy shrieked as her eyes came to rest on the figure on the 
floor. 

Sitting upright in the middle of the mess was Mr. Wood, grinning 
gleefully at her. He had several strands of beads around his neck, long, 
dangling earrings hanging from his ears, and a platter of leftover chicken on 
his lap. 



13 


“Kris, are you okay?” Lindy cried, turning her eyes away from the grinning, 
jewelry-covered dummy. 

Kris didn’t seem to hear her. 

“Are you okay?” Lindy repeated the question. 

“Wh-what’s going on?” Kris stammered, her back pressed against the 
wall, her expression taut with terror. “Who—who did this? Did Mr. Wood 
_?” 

Lindy started to reply. But their mother’s howl of surprise from the 
doorway cut off her words. “Mom—” Lindy cried, spinning around. 

Mrs. Powell clicked on the ceiling light. The kitchen seemed to flare 
up. All three of them blinked, struggling to adjust to the sudden brightness. 

“What on earth!” Mrs. Powell cried. She started to call to her husband, 
then remembered he wasn’t home. “I—I don’t believe this!” 

Barky came bounding into the room, his tail wagging. He lowered his 
head and started to lick up some spilled milk. 

“Out you go,” Mrs. Powell said sternly. She picked up the dog, carried 
him out, and closed the kitchen door. Then she strode into the center of the 
room, shaking her head, her bare feet narrowly missing the puddle of milk. 

“I came down for a drink, and I—I found this mess,” Kris said in a 
trembling voice. “The food. My jewelry. Everything...” 

“Mr. Wood did it,” Lindy accused. “Look at him!” 

“Stop it! Stop it!” Mrs. Powell screamed. “I’ve had enough.” 

Mrs. Powell surveyed the mess, frowning and tugging at a strand of 
blonde hair. Her eyes stopped on Mr. Wood, and she uttered a groan of 
disgust. 

“I knew it,” she said in a low voice, raising her eyes accusingly to the 
two girls. “I knew this had something to do with those ventriloquist 
dummies.” 

“Mr. Wood did it, Mom,” Kris said heatedly, stepping away from the 
wall, her hands tensed into fists. “I know it sounds dumb, but—” 

“Stop it,” Mrs. Powell ordered, narrowing her eyes. “This is just sick. 
Sick!” She stared hard at the jewel-bedecked dummy, who grinned up at her 



over the big platter of chicken. 

“I’m going to take the dummies away from you both,” Mrs. Powell 
said, turning back to Lindy and Kris. “This whole thing has just gotten out 
of control.” 

“No!” Kris cried. 

“That’s not fair!” Lindy declared. 

“I’m sorry. They have to be put away,” Mrs. Powell said firmly. She let 
her eyes move over the cluttered floor, and let out another weary sigh. 
“Look at my kitchen.” 

“But I didn’t do anything!” Lindy screamed. 

“I need Mr. Wood for the spring concert!” Kris protested. “Everyone is 
counting on me, Mom.” 

Mrs. Powell glanced from one to the other. Her eyes stayed on Kris. 
“That’s your dummy on the floor, right?” 

“Yeah,” Kris told her. “But I didn’t do this. I swear!” 

“You both swear you didn’t do it, right?” Mrs. Powell said, suddenly 
looking very tired under the harsh ceiling light. 

“Yes,” Lindy answered quickly. 

“Then you both lose your dummies. I’m sorry,” Mrs. Powell said. 
“One of you is lying. I—I really can’t believe this.” 

A heavy silence blanketed the room as all three Powells stared down in 
dismay at the mess on the floor. 

Kris was the first to speak. “Mom, what if Lindy and I clean 
everything up?” 

Lindy caught on quickly. Her face brightened. “Yeah. What if we put 
everything back. Right now. Make the kitchen just like normal. Make it 
spotless. Can we keep our dummies?” 

Mrs. Powell shook her head. “No. I don’t think so. Look at this mess. 
All the vegetables are spoiled. And the milk.” 

“We’ll replace it all,” Kris said quickly. “With our allowance. And 
we’ll clean it up perfectly. Please. If we do that, give us one more chance?” 

Mrs. Powell twisted her face in concentration, debating with herself. 
She stared at her daughters’ eager faces. “Okay,” she replied finally. “I want 
the kitchen spotless when I come down in the morning. All the food, all the 
jewelry. Everything back where it goes.” 

“Okay,” both girls said in unison. 



“And I don’t want to see either of those dummies down here in my 
kitchen again,” Mrs. Powell demanded. “If you can do that, I’ll give you 
one more chance.” 

“Great!” both girls cried at once. 

“And I don’t want to hear any more arguments about those dummies,” 
Mrs. Powell continued. “No more fights. No more competing. No more 
blaming everything on the dummies. I don’t want to hear anything about 
them. Ever.” 

“You won’t,” Kris promised, glancing at her sister. 

“Thanks, Mom,” Lindy said. “You go to bed. We’ll clean up.” She 
gave her mother a gentle shove toward the doorway. 

“Not another word,” Mrs. Powell reminded them. 

“Right, Mom,” the twins agreed. 

Their mother disappeared toward her room. They began to clean up. 
Kris pulled a large garbage bag from the drawer and held it while Lindy 
tossed in empty cartons and spoiled food. 

Kris carefully collected her jewelry and carried it upstairs. 

Neither girl spoke. They worked in silence, picking up, cleaning, and 
mopping until the kitchen was clean. Lindy closed the refrigerator door. She 
yawned loudly. 

Kris inspected the floor on her hands and knees, making sure it was 
spotless. Then she picked up Mr. Wood. He grinned back at her as if it was 
all a big joke. 

This dummy has been nothing but trouble, Kris thought. 

Nothing but trouble. 

She followed Lindy out of the kitchen, clicking off the light as she left. 
The two girls climbed the stairs silently. Neither of them had spoken a 
word. 

Pale moonlight filtered into their room through the open window. The 
air felt hot and steamy. 

Kris glanced at the clock. It was a little past three in the morning. 

Slappy sat slumped in the chair in front of the window, moonlight 
shining on his grinning face. Lindy, yawning, climbed into bed, pushed 
down the blanket, and pulled up the sheet. She turned her face away from 
her sister. 

Kris lowered Mr. Wood from her shoulder. You’re nothing but trouble, 



she thought angrily, holding him in front of her and staring at his grinning 
face. 

Nothing but trouble. 

Mr. Wood’s wide, leering grin seemed to mock her. 

A chill of fear mixed with her anger. 

I’m beginning to hate this dummy, she thought. 

Fear him and hate him. 

Angrily, she pulled open the closet door and tossed the dummy into the 
closet. It fell in a crumpled heap on the closet floor. 

Kris slammed the closet door shut. 

Her heart thudding, she climbed into bed and pulled up the covers. She 
suddenly felt very tired. Her entire body ached from weariness. 

She buried her face in the pillow and shut her eyes. 

She had just about fallen asleep when she heard the tiny voice. 

“Let me out! Let me out of here!” it cried. A muffled voice, coming 
from inside the closet. 



14 


“Let me out! Let me out!” the high-pitched voice called angrily. 

Kris sat up with a jolt. Her entire body convulsed in a shudder of fear. 

Her eyes darted to the other bed. Lindy hadn’t moved. 

“Did—did you hear it?” Kris stammered. 

“Hear what?” Lindy asked sleepily. 

“The voice,” Kris whispered. “In the closet.” 

“Huh?” Lindy asked sleepily. “What are you talking about? It’s three 
in the morning. Can’t we get some sleep?” 

“But, Lindy—” Kris lowered her feet to the floor. Her heart was 
thudding in her chest. “Wake up. Listen to me! Mr. Wood was calling to me. 
He was talking !” 

Lindy raised her head and listened. 

Silence. 

“I don’t hear anything, Kris. Really. Maybe you were dreaming.” 

“No!” Kris shrieked, feeling herself lose control. “It wasn’t a dream! 
I’m so scared, Lindy. I’m just so scared !” 

Suddenly Kris was trembling all over, and hot tears were pouring 
down her cheeks. 

Lindy stood up and moved to the edge of her sister’s bed. 

“Something h-horrible is going on here, Lindy,” Kris stammered 
through her tears. 

“And I know who’s doing it,” Lindy whispered, leaning over her twin, 
putting a comforting hand on her quivering shoulder. 

“Huh?” 

“Yes. I know who’s been doing it all,” Lindy whispered. “I know who 
it is.” 


“Who?” Kris asked breathlessly. 



15 


“Who?” Kris repeated, letting the tears run down her cheeks. “Who?” 

“I have,” Lindy said. Her smile spread into a grin almost as wide as 
Slappy’s. She closed her eyes and laughed. 

“Huh?” Kris didn’t understand. “What did you say?” 

“I said I have been doing it,” Lindy repeated. “Me. Lindy. It was all a 
joke, Kris. I gotcha again.” She nodded her head as if confirming her 
words. 

Kris gaped at her twin in disbelief. “It was all a joke?” 

Lindy kept nodding. 

“You moved Mr. Wood during the night? You dressed him in my 
clothes and made him say those gross things to me? You put him in the 
kitchen? You made that horrible mess?” 

Lindy chuckled. “Yeah. I really scared you, didn’t I?” 

Kris balled her hands into angry fists. “But—but—” she sputtered. 
“Why?” 

“For fun,” Lindy replied, dropping back onto her bed, still grinning. 

“Fun?” 

“I wanted to see if I could scare you,” Lindy explained. “It was just a 
joke. You know. I can’t believe you fell for that voice in the closet just now! 
I must be a really good ventriloquist!” 

“But, Lindy—” 

“You really believed Mr. Wood was alive or something!” Lindy said, 
laughing, enjoying her victory. “You’re such a nit!” 

“Nit?” 

“Half a nitwit!” Lindy burst into wild laughter. 

“It isn’t funny,” Kris said softly. 

“I know,” Lindy replied. “It’s a riot! You should’ve seen the look on 
your face when you saw Mr. Wood downstairs in your precious beads and 
earrings!” 

“How—how did you ever think of such a mean joke?” Kris demanded. 

“It just came to me,” Lindy answered with some pride. “When you got 
your dummy.” 



“You didn’t want me to get a dummy,” Kris said thoughtfully. 

“You’re right,” Lindy quickly agreed. “I wanted something that would 
be mine, for a change. I’m so tired of you being a copycat. So—” 

“So you thought of this mean joke,” Kris accused. 

Lindy nodded. 

Kris strode angrily to the window and pressed her forehead against the 
glass. “I—I can’t believe I was so stupid,” she muttered. 

“Neither can I,” Lindy agreed, grinning again. 

“You really made me start thinking that Mr. Wood was alive or 
something,” Kris said, staring out the window to the back yard below. “You 
really made me afraid of him.” 

“Aren’t I brilliant!” Lindy proclaimed. 

Kris turned to face her sister. “I’m never speaking to you again,” she 
said angrily. 

Lindy shrugged. “It was just a joke.” 

“No,” Kris insisted. “It was too mean to be just a joke. I’m never 
speaking to you again. Never.” 

“Fine,” Lindy replied curtly. “I thought you had a sense of humor. 
Fine.” She slid into bed, her back to Kris, and pulled the covers up over her 
head. 

I’ve got to find a way to pay her back for this, Kris thought. But how? 



16 


After school a few days later, Kris walked home with Cody. It was a hot, 
humid afternoon. The trees were still, and seemed to throw little shade on 
the sidewalk. The air above the pavement shimmered in the heat. 

“Wish we had a swimming pool,” Kris muttered, pulling her backpack 
off her shoulder. 

“I wish you had one, too,” Cody said, wiping his forehead with the 
sleeve of his red T-shirt. 

“I’d like to dive into an enormous pool of iced tea,” Kris said, “like in 
the TV commercials. It always looks so cold and refreshing.” 

Cody made a face. “Swim in iced tea? With ice cubes and lemon?” 

“Forget it,” Kris muttered. 

They crossed the street. A couple of kids they knew rode by on bikes. 
Two men in white uniforms were up on ladders, leaning against the corner 
house, painting the gutters. 

“Bet they’re hot,” Cody remarked. 

“Let’s change the subject,” Kris suggested. 

“How are you doing with Mr. Wood?” Cody asked. 

“Not bad,” Kris said. “I think I’ve got some pretty good jokes. I should 
be ready for the concert tomorrow night.” 

They stopped at the corner and let a large blue van rumble past. 

“Are you talking to your sister?” Cody asked as they crossed the street. 
The bright sunlight made his white-blond hair glow. 

“A little,” Kris said, making a face. “I’m talking to her. But I haven’t 
forgiven her.” 

“That was such a dumb stunt she pulled,” Cody said sympathetically. 
He wiped the sweat off his forehead with the sleeve of his T-shirt. 

“It just made me feel like such a dork,” Kris admitted. “I mean, I was 
so stupid. She really had me believing that Mr. Wood was doing all that 
stuff.” Kris shook her head. Thinking about it made her feel embarrassed all 
over again. 

Her house came into view. She unzipped the back compartment of her 
backpack and searched for the keys. 



“Did you tell your mom about Lindy’s practical joke?” Cody asked. 

Kris shook her head. “Mom is totally disgusted. We’re not allowed to 
mention the dummies to her. Dad got home from Portland last night, and 
Mom told him what was going on. So we’re not allowed to mention the 
dummies to him, either!” She found the keys and started up the drive. 
“Thanks for walking home with me.” 

“Yeah. Sure.” Cody gave her a little wave and continued on toward his 
house up the street. 

Kris pushed the key into the front door lock. She could hear Barky 
jumping and yipping excitedly on the other side of the door. “I’m coming, 
Barky,” she called in. “Hold your horses.” 

She pushed open the door. Barky began leaping on her, whimpering as 
if she’d been away for months. “Okay, okay!” she cried laughing. 

It took several minutes to calm the dog down. Then Kris got a snack 
from the kitchen and headed up to her room to practice with Mr. Wood. 

She hoisted the dummy up from the chair where it had spent the day 
beside Lindy’s dummy. A can of Coke in one hand, the dummy over her 
shoulder, she headed to the dressing table and sat down in front of the 
mirror. 

This was the best time of day to rehearse, Kris thought. No one was 
home. Her parents were at work. Lindy was at some after-school activity. 

She arranged Mr. Wood on her lap. “Time to go to work,” she made 
him say, reaching into his back to move his lips. She made his eyes slide 
back and forth. 

A button on his plaid shirt had come unbuttoned. Kris leaned him 
down against the dressing table and started to fasten it. 

Something caught her eye. Something yellow inside the pocket. 

“Weird,” Kris said aloud. “I never noticed anything in there.” 

Slipping two fingers into the slender pocket, she pulled out a yellowed 
sheet of paper, folded up. 

Probably just the receipt for him, Kris thought. 

She unfolded the sheet of paper and held it up to read it. 

It wasn’t a receipt. The paper contained a single sentence handwritten 
very cleanly in bold black ink. It was in a language Kris didn’t recognize. 
“Did someone send you a love note, Mr. Wood?” she asked the dummy. 

It stared up at her lifelessly. 



Kris lowered her eyes to the paper and read the strange sentence out 

loud: 

“Kami marri odonna loma molonu karrano.” 

What language is that? Kris wondered. 

She glanced down at the dummy and uttered a low cry of surprise. 

Mr. Wood appeared to blink. 

But that wasn’t possible —was it? 

Kris took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. 

The dummy stared up at her, his painted eyes as dull and wide open as 

ever. 

Let’s not get paranoid, Kris scolded herself. 

“Time to work, Mr. Wood,” she told him. She folded up the piece of 
yellow paper and slipped it back into his shirt pocket. Then she raised him 
to a sitting position, searching for the eye and mouth controls with her 
hand. 

“How are things around your house, Mr. Wood?” 

“Not good, Kris. I’ve got termites. I need termites like I need another 
hole in my head! Ha-ha!” 

“Lindy! Kris! Could you come downstairs, please!” Mr. Powell called from 
the foot of the stairs. 

It was after dinner, and the twins were up in their room. Lindy was 
sprawled on her stomach on the bed, reading a book for school. Kris was in 
front of the dressing table mirror, rehearsing quietly with Mr. Wood for 
tomorrow night’s concert. 

“What do you want, Dad?” Lindy shouted down, rolling her eyes. 
“We’re kind of busy,” Kris shouted, shifting the dummy on her lap. 
“The Millers are here, and they’re dying to see your ventriloquist 
acts,” their father shouted up. 

Lindy and Kris both groaned. The Millers were the elderly couple who 
lived next door. They were very nice people, but very boring. 

The twins heard Mr. Powell’s footsteps on the stairs. A few seconds 
later, he poked his head into their room. “Come on, girls. Just put on a short 
show for the Millers. They came over for coffee, and we told them about 
your dummies.” 

“But I have to rehearse for tomorrow night,” Kris insisted. 



“Rehearse on them,” her father suggested. “Come on. Just do five 
minutes. They’ll get a real kick out of it.” 

Sighing loudly, the girls agreed. Carrying their dummies over their 
shoulders, they followed their father down to the living room. 

Mr. and Mrs. Miller were side by side on the couch, coffee mugs in 
front of them on the low coffee table. They smiled and called out cheerful 
greetings as the girls appeared. 

Kris was always struck by how much the Millers looked alike. They 
both had slender, pink faces topped with spongy white hair. They both wore 
silver-framed bifocals, which slipped down on nearly identical, pointy 
noses. They both had the same smile. Mr. Miller had a small, gray 
mustache. Lindy always joked that he grew it so the Millers could tell each 
other apart. 

Is that what happens to you when you’ve been married a long time? 
Kris found herself thinking. You start to look exactly alike? 

The Millers were even dressed alike, in loose-fitting tan Bermuda 
shorts and white cotton sports shirts. 

“Lindy and Kris took up ventriloquism a few weeks ago,” Mrs. Powell 
was explaining, twisting herself forward to see the girls from the armchair. 
She motioned them to the center of the room. “And they both seem to have 
some talent for it.” 

“Have you girls ever heard of Bergen and McCarthy?” Mrs. Miller 
asked, smiling. 

“Who?” Lindy and Kris asked in unison. 

“Before your time,” Mr. Miller said, chuckling. “They were a 
ventriloquist act.” 

“Can you do something for us?” Mrs. Miller asked, picking up her 
coffee mug and setting it in her lap. 

Mr. Powell pulled a dining room chair into the center of the room. 
“Here. Lindy, why don’t you go first?” He turned to the Millers. “They’re 
very good. You’ll see,” he said. 

Lindy sat down and arranged Slappy on her lap. The Millers 
applauded. Mrs. Miller nearly spilled her coffee, but she caught the mug 
just in time. 

“Don’t applaud—just throw money!” Lindy made Slappy say. 
Everyone laughed as if they’d never heard that before. 



Kris watched from the stairway as Lindy did a short routine. Lindy 
was really good, she had to admit. Very smooth. The Millers were laughing 
so hard, their faces were bright red. An identical shade of red. Mrs. Miller 
kept squeezing her husband’s knee when she laughed. 

Lindy finished to big applause. The Millers gushed about how 
wonderful she was. Lindy told them about the TV show she might be on, 
and they promised they wouldn’t miss it. “We’ll tape it,” Mr. Miller said. 

Kris took her place on the chair and sat Mr. Wood up in her lap. “This 
is Mr. Wood,” she told the Millers. “We’re going to be the hosts of the 
spring concert at school tomorrow night. So I’ll give you a preview of what 
we’re going to say.” 

“That’s a nice-looking dummy,” Mrs. Miller said quietly. 

“You’re a nice-looking dummy, too!” Mr. Wood declared in a harsh, 
raspy growl of a voice. 

Kris’ mother gasped. The Millers’ smiles faded. 

Mr. Wood leaned forward on Kris’ lap and stared at Mr. Miller. “Is that 
a mustache, or are you eating a rat?” he asked nastily. 

Mr. Miller glanced uncomfortably at his wife, then forced a laugh. 
They both laughed. 

“Don’t laugh so hard. You might drop your false teeth!” Mr. Wood 
shouted. “And how do you get your teeth that disgusting shade of yellow? 
Does your bad breath do that?” 

“Kris!” Mrs. Powell shouted. “That’s enough!” 

The Millers’ faces were bright red now, their expressions bewildered. 

“That’s not funny. Apologize to the Millers,” Mr. Powell insisted, 
crossing the room and standing over Kris. 

“I—I didn’t say any of it!” Kris stammered. “Really, I—” 

“Kris—apologize!” her father demanded angrily. 

Mr. Wood turned to the Millers. “I’m sorry,” he rasped. “I’m sorry 
you’re so ugly! I’m sorry you’re so old and stupid, too!” 

The Millers stared at each other unhappily. “I don’t get her humor,” 
Mrs. Miller said. 

“It’s just crude insults,” Mr. Miller replied quietly. 

“Kris—what is wrong with you?” Mrs. Powell demanded. She had 
crossed the room to stand beside her husband. “Apologize to the Millers 
right now! I don’t believe you!” 



“I—I—” Gripping Mr. Wood tightly around the waist, Kris rose to her 
feet. “I—I—” She tried to utter an apology, but no words would come out. 

“Sorry!” she finally managed to scream. Then, with an embarrassed 
cry, she turned and fled up the stairs, tears streaming down her face. 



17 


“You have to believe me!” Kris cried in a trembling voice. “I really didn’t 
say any of those things. Mr. Wood was talking by himself!” 

Lindy rolled her eyes. “Tell me another one,” she muttered 
sarcastically. 

Lindy had followed Kris upstairs. Down in the living room, her 
parents were still apologizing to the Millers. Now, Kris sat on the edge of 
her bed, wiping tears off her cheeks. Lindy stood with her arms crossed in 
front of the dressing table. 

“I don’t make insulting jokes like that,” Kris said, glancing at Mr. 
Wood, who lay crumpled in the center of the floor where Kris had tossed 
him. “You know that isn’t my sense of humor.” 

“So why’d you do it?” Lindy demanded. “Why’d you want to make 
everyone mad?” 

“But I didn’t!” Kris shrieked, tugging at the sides of her hair. “Mr. 
Wood said those things! I didn’t!” 

“How can you be such a copycat?” Lindy asked disgustedly. “I already 
did that joke, Kris. Can’t you think of something original?” 

“It’s not a joke,” Kris insisted. “Why don’t you believe me?” 

“No way,” Lindy replied, shaking her head, her arms still crossed in 
front of her chest. “No way I’m going to fall for the same gag.” 

“Lindy, please!” Kris pleaded. “I’m frightened. I’m really frightened.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Lindy said sarcastically. “I’m shaking all over, too. 
Wow. You really fooled me, Kris. Guess you showed me you can play 
funny tricks, too.” 

“Shut up!” Kris snapped. More tears formed in the corners of her eyes. 

“Very good crying,” Lindy said. “But it doesn’t fool me, either. And it 
won’t fool Mom and Dad.” She turned and picked up Slappy. “Maybe 
Slappy and I should practice some jokes. After your performance tonight, 
Mom and Dad might not let you do the concert tomorrow night.” 

She slung Slappy over her shoulder and, stepping over the crumpled 
form of Mr. Wood, hurried from the room. 



It was hot and noisy backstage in the auditorium. Kris’ throat was dry, and 
she kept walking over to the water fountain and slurping mouthfuls of the 
warm water. 

The voices of the audience on the other side of the curtain seemed to 
echo off all four walls and the ceiling. The louder the noise became as the 
auditorium filled, the more nervous Kris felt. 

How am I ever going to do my act in front of all those people? she 
asked herself, pulling the edge of the curtain back a few inches and peering 
out. Her parents were off to the side, in the third row. 

Seeing them brought memories of the night before flooding back to 
Kris. Her parents had grounded her for two weeks as punishment for 
insulting the Millers. They almost hadn’t let her come to the concert. 

Kris stared at the kids and adults filing into the large auditorium, 
recognizing a lot of faces. She realized her hands were ice cold. Her throat 
was dry again. 

Don’t think of it as an audience, she told herself. Think of it as a bunch 
of kids and parents, most of whom you know. 

Somehow that made it worse. 

She let go of the curtain, hurried to get one last drink from the 
fountain, then retrieved Mr. Wood from the table she had left him on. 

It suddenly grew quiet on the other side of the curtain. The concert was 
about to begin. 

“Break a leg!” Lindy called across to her as she hurried to join the 
other chorus members. 

“Thanks,” Kris replied weakly. She pulled up Mr. Wood and 
straightened his shirt. “Your hands are clammy!” she made him say. 

“No insults tonight,” Kris told him sternly. 

To her shock, the dummy blinked. 

“Hey!” she cried. She hadn’t touched his eye controls. 

She had a stab of fear that went beyond stage fright. Maybe I shouldn’t 
go on with this, she thought, staring intently at Mr. Wood, watching for him 
to blink again. 

Maybe I should say I’m sick and not perform with him. 

“Are you nervous?” a voice whispered. 

“Huh?” At first, she thought it was Mr. Wood. But then she quickly 
realized that it was Mrs. Berman, the music teacher. 



“Yeah. A little,” Kris admitted, feeling her face grow hot. 

“You’ll be terrific,” Mrs. Berman gushed, squeezing Kris’ shoulder 
with a sweaty hand. She was a large, heavyset woman with several chins, a 
red lipsticked mouth, and flowing black hair. She was wearing a long, 
loose-fitting dress of red-and-blue flower patterns. “Here goes,” she said, 
giving Kris’ shoulder one more squeeze. 

Then she stepped onstage, blinking against the harsh white light of the 
spotlight, to introduce Kris and Mr. Wood. 

Am I really doing this? Kris asked herself. 

Can I do this? 

Her heart was pounding so hard, she couldn’t hear Mrs. Berman’s 
introduction. Then, suddenly, the audience was applauding, and Kris found 
herself walking across the stage to the microphone, carrying Mr. Wood in 
both hands. 

Mrs. Berman, her flowery dress flowing around her, was heading 
offstage. She smiled at Kris and gave her an encouraging wink as they 
passed each other. 

Squinting against the bright spotlight, Kris walked to the middle of the 
stage. Her mouth felt as dry as cotton. She wondered if she could make a 
sound. 

A folding chair had been set up for her. She sat down, arranging Mr. 
Wood on her lap, then realized that the microphone was much too high. 

This drew titters of soft laughter from the audience. 

Embarrassed, Kris stood up and, holding Mr. Wood under one arm, 
struggled to lower the microphone. 

“Are you having trouble?” Mrs. Berman called from the side of the 
stage. She hurried over to help Kris. 

But before the music teacher got halfway across the stage, Mr. Wood 
leaned into the microphone. “What time does the blimp go up?” he rasped 
nastily, staring at Mrs. Berman’s dress. 

“What?” She stopped in surprise. 

“Your face reminds me of a wart I had removed!” Mr. Wood growled 
at the startled woman. 

Her mouth dropped open in horror. “Kris!” 

“If we count your chins, will it tell us your age?” 

There was laughter floating up from the audience. But it was mixed 



with gasps of horror. 

“Kris—that’s enough!” Mrs. Berman cried, the microphone picking up 
her angry protest. 

“You’re more than enough! You’re enough for two!” Mr. Wood 
declared nastily. “If you got any bigger, you’d need your own zip code!” 

“Kris—really! I’m going to ask you to apologize,” Mrs. Berman said, 
her face bright red. 

“Mrs. Berman, I—I’m not doing it!” Kris stammered. “I’m not saying 
these things!” 

“Please apologize. To me and to the audience,” Mrs. Berman 
demanded. 

Mr. Wood leaned into the microphone. “Apologize for THIS!” he 
screamed. 

The dummy’s head tilted back. His jaw dropped. His mouth opened 
wide. 

And a thick green liquid came spewing out. 

“Yuck!” someone screamed. 

It looked like pea soup. It spurted up out of Mr. Wood’s open mouth 
like water rushing from a fire hose. 

Voices screamed and cried out their surprise as the thick, green liquid 
showered over the people in the front rows. 

“Stop it!” 

“Help!” 

“Somebody—turn it off!” 

“It stinks!” 

Kris froze in horror, staring as more and more of the disgusting 
substance poured from her dummy’s gaping mouth. 

A putrid stench—the smell of sour milk, of rotten eggs, of burning 
rubber, of decayed meat—rose up from the liquid. It puddled over the stage 
and showered over the front seats. 

Blinded by the spotlight, Kris couldn’t see the audience in front of her. 
But she could hear the choking and the gagging, the frantic cries for help. 

“Clear the auditorium! Clear the auditorium!” Mrs. Berman was 
shouting. 

Kris heard the rumble and scrape of people shoving their way up the 
aisles and out the doors. 



“It stinks!” 

“I’m sick!” 

“Somebody—help!” 

Kris tried to clamp her hand over the dummy’s mouth. But the force of 
the putrid green liquid frothing and spewing out was too strong. It pushed 
her hand away. 

Suddenly she realized she was being shoved from behind. Off the 
stage. Away from the shouting people fleeing the auditorium. Out of the 
glaring spotlight. 

She was backstage before she realized that it was Mrs. Berman who 
was pushing her. 

“I—I don’t know how you did that. Or why!” Mrs. Berman shouted 
angrily, frantically wiping splotches of the disgusting green liquid off the 
front of her dress with both hands. “But I’m going to see that you’re 
suspended from school, Kris! And if I have my way,” she sputtered, “you’ll 
be suspended for lifel” 



18 


“That’s right. Close the door,” Mr. Powell said sternly, glaring with 
narrowed eyes at Kris. 

He stood a few inches behind her, arms crossed in front of him, 
making sure she followed his instructions. She had carefully folded Mr. 
Wood in half and shoved him to the back of her closet shelf. Now she 
closed the closet, making sure it was completely shut, as he ordered. 

Lindy watched silently from her bed, her expression troubled. 

“Does the closet door lock?” Mr. Powell asked. 

“No. Not really,” Kris told him, lowering her head. 

“Well, that will have to do,” he said. “On Monday, I’m taking him 
back to the pawn shop. Do not take him out until then.” 

“But, Dad—” 

He raised a hand to silence her. 

“We have to talk about this,” Kris pleaded. “You have to listen to me. 
What happened tonight—it wasn’t a practical joke. I—” 

Her father turned away from her, a scowl on his face. “Kris, I’m sorry. 
We’ll talk tomorrow. Your mother and I—we’re both too angry and too 
upset to talk now.” 

“But, Dad—” 

Ignoring her, he stormed out of the room. She listened to his footsteps, 
hard and hurried, down the stairs. Then Kris slowly turned to Lindy. “Now 
do you believe me?” 

“I—I don’t know what to believe,” Lindy replied. “It was just so... 
unbelievably gross.” 

“Lindy, I—I—” 

“Daddy’s right. Let’s talk tomorrow,” Lindy said. “I’m sure everything 
will be clearer and calmer tomorrow.” 

But Kris couldn’t sleep. She shifted from side to side, uncomfortable, wide 
awake. She pulled the pillow over her face, held it there for a while, 
welcoming the soft darkness, then tossed it to the floor. 

I’m never going to sleep again, she thought. 



Every time she closed her eyes, she saw the hideous scene in the 
auditorium once again. She heard the astonished cries of the audience, the 
kids and their parents. And she heard the cries of shock turn to groans of 
disgust as the putrid gunk poured out over everyone. 

Sickening. So totally sickening. 

And everyone blamed her. 

My life is ruined, Kris thought. I can never go back there again. I can 
never go to school. I can never show my face anywhere. 

Ruined. My whole life. Ruined by that stupid dummy. 

In the next bed, Lindy snored softly, in a slow, steady rhythm. 

Kris turned her eyes to the bedroom window. The curtains hung down 
over the window, filtering the pale moonlight from outside. Slappy sat in 
his usual place in the chair in front of the window, bent in two, his head 
between his knees. 

Stupid dummies, Kris thought bitterly. So stupid. 

And now my life is ruined. 

She glanced at the clock. One-twenty. Outside the window, she heard a 
low, mmbling sound. A soft whistle of brakes. Probably a large truck going 

by. 

Kris yawned. She closed her eyes and saw the gross green gunk 
spewing out of Mr. Wood’s mouth. 

Will I see that every time I close my eyes? she wondered. 

What on earth was it? How could everyone blame me for something 
so... so... 

The rumbling of the tmck faded into the distance. 

But then Kris heard another sound. A rustling sound. 

A soft footstep. 

Someone was moving. 

She sucked in her breath and held it, listening hard. 

Silence now. Silence so heavy, she could hear the loud thudding of her 
heart. 

Then another soft footstep. 

A shadow moved. 

The closet door swung open. 

Or was it just shadows shifting? 

No. Someone was moving. Moving from the open closet. Someone 



was creeping toward the bedroom door. Creeping so softly, so silently. 

Her heart pounding, Kris pulled herself up, trying not to make a sound. 
Realizing that she’d been holding her breath, she let it out slowly, silently. 
She took another breath, then sat up. 

The shadow moved slowly to the door. 

Kris lowered her feet to the floor, staring hard into the darkness, her 
eyes staying with the silent, moving figure. 

What’s happening? she wondered. 

The shadow moved again. She heard a scraping sound, the sound of a 
sleeve brushing the doorframe. 

Kris pushed herself to her feet. Her legs felt shaky as she crept to the 
door, following the moving shadow. 

Out into the hallway. Even darker out here because there were no 
windows. 

Toward the stairway. 

The shadow moved more quickly now. 

Kris followed, her bare feet moving lightly over the thin carpet. 

What’s happening? What’s happening? 

She caught up to the shadowy figure on the landing. “Hey!” she called, 
her voice a tight whisper. 

She grabbed the shoulder and turned the figure around. 

And stared into the grinning face of Mr. Wood. 



19 


Mr. Wood blinked, then hissed at her, an ugly sound, a menacing sound. In 
the darkness of the stairwell, his painted grin became a threatening leer. 

In her fright, Kris squeezed the dummy’s shoulder, wrapping her 
fingers around the harsh fabric of his shirt. 

“This—this is impossible!” she whispered. 

He blinked again. He giggled. His mouth opened, making his grin 
grow wider. 

He tried to tug out of Kris’ grasp, but she hung on without even 
realizing she was holding him. 

“But—you’re a dummy!” she squealed. 

He giggled again. “So are you,” he replied. His voice was a deep 
growl, like the angry snarl of a large dog. 

“You can’t walk!” Kris cried, her voice trembling. 

The dummy giggled its ugly giggle again. 

“You can’t be alive!” Kris exclaimed. 

“Let go of me— now! ” the dummy growled. 

Kris held on, tightening her grip. “I’m dreaming,” Kris told herself 
aloud. “I have to be dreaming.” 

“I’m not a dream. I’m a nightmare!” the dummy exclaimed, and tossed 
back his wooden head, laughing. 

Still gripping the shoulder of the shirt, Kris stared through the darkness 
at the grinning face. The air seemed to grow heavy and hot. She felt as if 
she couldn’t breathe, as if she were suffocating. 

What was that sound? 

It took her a while to recognize the strained gasps of her own 
breathing. 

“Let go of me,” the dummy repeated. “Or I’ll throw you down the 
stairs.” He tried once again to tug out of her grasp. 

“No!” Kris insisted, holding tight. “I—I’m putting you back in the 
closet.” 

The dummy laughed, then pushed his painted face close to Kris’ face. 
“You can’t keep me there.” 



“I’m locking you in. I’m locking you in a box. In something !” Kris 
declared, panic clouding her thoughts. 

The darkness seemed to descend over her, choking her, weighing her 
down. 

“Let go of me.” The dummy pulled hard. 

Kris reached out her other hand and grabbed him around the waist. 

“Let go of me,” he snarled in his raspy, deep rumble of a voice. “I’m in 
charge now. You will listen to me. This is my house now.” 

He pulled hard. 

Kris encircled his waist. 

They both fell onto the stairs, rolling down a few steps. 

“Let go!” the dummy ordered. He rolled on top of her, his wild eyes 
glaring into hers. 

She pushed him off, tried to pin his arms behind his back. 

He was surprisingly strong. He pulled back one arm, then shoved a fist 
hard into the pit of her stomach. 

“Ohhh.” Kris groaned, feeling the breath knocked out of her. 

The dummy took advantage of her momentary weakness, and pulled 
free. Grasping the banister with one hand, he tried to pull himself past her 
and down the stairs. 

But Kris shot out a foot and tripped him. 

Still struggling to breathe, she pounced onto his back. Then she pulled 
him away from the banister and pushed him down hard onto a step. 

“Oh!” Kris gasped loudly as the overhead hall light flashed on. She 
closed her eyes against the sudden harsh intrusion. The dummy struggled to 
pull out from under her, but she pushed down on his back with all her 
weight. 

“Kris—what on earth—?!” Lindy’s startled voice called down from 
the top step. 

“It’s Mr. Wood!” Kris managed to cry up to her. “He’s... a/z've!” She 
pushed down hard, sprawled over the dummy, keeping him pinned beneath 
her. 

“Kris—what are you doing?” Lindy demanded. “Are you okay?” 

“No!” Kris exclaimed. “I’m not okay! Please—Lindy! Go get Mom 
and Dad! Mr. Wood—he’s alive!” 

“It’s just a dummy!” Lindy called down, taking a few reluctant steps 



toward her sister. “Get up, Kris! Have you lost your mind?” 

“Listen to me!” Kris shrieked at the top of her lungs. “Get Mom and 
Dad! Before he escapes!” 

But Lindy didn’t move. She stared down at her sister, her long hair 
falling in tangles about her face, her features twisted in horror. “Get up, 
Kris,” she urged. “Please—get up. Let’s go back to bed.” 

“I’m telling you, he’s alive!” Kris cried desperately. “You’ve got to 
believe me, Lindy. You’ve got to!” 

The dummy lay lifelessly beneath her, his face buried in the carpet, his 
arms and legs sprawled out to the sides. 

“You had a nightmare,” Lindy insisted, climbing down step by step, 
holding her long nightshirt up above her ankles until she was standing right 
above Kris. “Come back to bed, Kris. It was just a nightmare. The horrible 
thing that happened at the concert—it gave you a nightmare, that’s all.” 

Gasping for breath, Kris lifted herself up and twisted her head to face 
her sister. Grabbing the banister with one hand, she raised herself a little. 

The instant she lightened up on him, the dummy grabbed the edge of 
the stair with both hands and pulled himself out from under her. Half¬ 
falling, half-crawling, he scrambled down the rest of the stairs. 

“No! No! I don’t believe it!” Lindy shrieked, seeing the dummy move. 

“Go get Mom and Dad!” Kris said. “Hurry!” 

Her mouth wide open in shocked disbelief, Lindy turned and headed 
back up the stairs, screaming for her parents. 

Kris dived off the step, thrusting her arms in front of her. 

She tackled Mr. Wood from behind, wrapping her arms around his 
waist. 

His head hit the carpet hard as they both crumpled to the floor. 

He uttered a low, throaty cry of pain. His eyes closed. He didn’t move. 

Dazed, her chest heaving, her entire body trembling, Kris slowly 
climbed to her feet. She quickly pressed a foot on the dummy’s back to hold 
him in place. 

“Mom and Dad—where are you?” she cried aloud. “Hurry.” 

The dummy raised its head. He let out an angry growl and started to 
thrash his arms and legs wildly. 

Kris pressed her foot hard against his back. 

“Let go!” he growled viciously. 



Kris heard voices upstairs. 

“Mom? Dad? Down here!” she called up to them. 

Both of her parents appeared at the upstairs landing, their faces filled 
with worry. 

“Look!” Kris cried, frantically pointing down to the dummy beneath 
her foot. 



20 


“Look at what?” Mr. Powell cried, adjusting his pajama top. 

Kris pointed down to the dummy under her foot. “He—he’s trying to 
get away,” she stammered. 

But Mr. Wood lay lifeless on his stomach. 

“Is this supposed to be a joke?” Mrs. Powell demanded angrily, hands 
at the waist of her cotton nightgown. 

“I don’t get it,” Mr. Powell said, shaking his head. 

“Mr. Wood—he ran down the stairs,” Kris said frantically. “He’s been 
doing everything. He—” 

“This isn’t funny,” Mrs. Powell said wearily, running a hand back 
through her blonde hair. “It isn’t funny at all, Kris. Waking everyone up in 
the middle of the night.” 

“I really think you’ve lost your mind. I’m very worried about you,” 
Mr. Powell added. “I mean, after what happened at school tonight—” 

“Listen to me!” Kris shrieked. She bent down and pulled Mr. Wood up 
from the floor. Holding him by the shoulders, she shook him hard. “He 
moves! He runs! He talks! He—he’s alivel” 

She stopped shaking the dummy and let go. He slumped lifelessly to 
the floor, falling in an unmoving heap at her feet. 

“I think maybe you need to see a doctor,” Mr. Powell said, his face 
tightening with concern. 

“No. I saw him, too!” Lindy said, coming to Kris’ aid. “Kris is right. 
The dummy did move.” But then she added, “I mean, I think it moved!” 

You’re a big help, Lindy, Kris thought, suddenly feeling weak, 
drained. 

“Is this just another stupid prank?” Mrs. Powell asked angrily. “After 
what happened at school tonight, I’d think that would be enough.” 

“But, Mom—” Kris started, staring down at the lifeless heap at her 

feet. 

“Back to bed,” Mrs. Powell ordered. “There’s no school tomorrow. 
We’ll have plenty of time to discuss punishments for you two.” 

“Me?” Lindy cried, outraged. “What did / do?” 



“Mom, we’re telling the truth!” Kris insisted. 

“I still don’t get the joke,” Mr. Powell said, shaking his head. He 
turned to his wife. “Were we supposed to believe her or something?” 

“Get to bed. Both of you. Now!” their mother snapped. She and their 
father disappeared from the upstairs landing, heading angrily back down the 
hall to their room. 

Lindy remained, one hand on the top of the banister, staring down 
regretfully at Kris. 

“You believe me, don’t you?” Kris called up to her. 

“Yeah. I guess,” Lindy replied doubtfully, lowering her eyes to the 
dummy at Kris’ feet. 

Kris looked down, too. She saw Mr. Wood blink. He started to 
straighten up. 

“Whoa!” She uttered an alarmed cry and grabbed him by the neck. 
“Lindy—hurry!” she called. “He’s moving again!” 

“Wh-what should we do?” Lindy stammered, making her way 
hesitantly down the stairs. 

“I don’t know,” Kris replied as the dummy thrashed his arms and legs 
against the carpet, trying desperately to free himself from her two-handed 
grip on his neck. “We’ve got to—” 

“There’s nothing you can do,” Mr. Wood snarled. “You will be my 
slaves now. I’m alive once again! Alive!” 

“But—how?” Kris demanded, staring at him in disbelief. “I mean, 
you’re a dummy. How—?” 

The dummy snickered. “You brought me back to life,” he told her in 
his raspy voice. “You read the ancient words.” 

The ancient words? What was he talking about? 

And then Kris remembered. She had read the strange-sounding words 
from the sheet of paper in the dummy’s shirt pocket. 

“I am back, thanks to you,” the dummy growled. “And now you and 
your sister will serve me.” 

As she stared in horror at the grinning dummy, an idea popped into 
Kris’ mind. 

The paper. She had tucked it back into his pocket. 

If I read the words again, Kris thought, it will put him back to sleep. 

She reached out and grabbed him. He tried to jerk away, but she was 



too quick. 

The folded sheet of yellow paper was in her hand. 

“Give me that!” he cried. He swiped at it, but Kris swung it out of his 
reach. 

She unfolded it quickly. And before the dummy could grab the paper 
out of her hands, she read the strange words aloud: 

“Kami marri odonna loma molonu karrano.” 



21 


Both sisters stared at the dummy, waiting for him to collapse. 

But he gripped the banister and tossed his head back in an amused, 
scornful laugh. “Those are the words of the ancient sorcerer to bring me to 
life!” he proclaimed. “Those aren’t the words to kill me!” 

Kill him? 

Yes, Kris thought frantically. She tossed down the yellow paper 
disgustedly. 

We have no choice. 

“We have to kill him, Lindy.” 

“Huh?” Her sister’s face filled with surprise. 

Kris grabbed the dummy by the shoulders and held on tightly. “I’ll 
hold him. You pull his head off.” 

Lindy was beside her now. She had to duck away from Mr. Wood’s 
thrashing feet. 

“I’ll hold him still,” Kris repeated. “Grab his head. Pull it off.” 

“You—you’re sure?” Lindy hesitated, her features tight with fear. 

“Just do it! ” Kris screamed. 

She let her hands slide down around Mr. Wood’s waist. 

Lindy grabbed his head in both hands. 

“Let go of me!” the dummy rasped. 

“Pull!” Kris cried to her terrified sister. 

Holding the dummy tightly around the waist, she leaned back, pulling 
him away from her sister. 

Lindy’s hands were wrapped tightly around the dummy’s head. With a 
loud groan, she pulled hard. 

The head didn’t come off. 

Mr. Wood uttered a high-pitched giggle. “Stop. You’re tickling me!” 
he rasped. 

“Pull harder!” Kris ordered her sister. 

Lindy’s face was bright red. She tightened her grip on the head and 
pulled again, tugging with all her strength. 



The dummy giggled his shrill, unpleasant giggle. 

“It—it won’t come off,” Lindy said, sighing in defeat. 

“Twist it off!” Kris suggested frantically. 

The dummy thrashed out with his feet, kicking Kris in the stomach. 
But she held on. “Twist the head off!” she cried. 

Lindy tried to turn the head. 

The dummy giggled. 

“It won’t twist!” Lindy cried in frustration. She let go of the head and 
took a step back. 

Mr. Wood raised his head, stared up at Lindy, and grinned. “You can’t 
kill me. I have powers.” 

“What do we do?” Lindy cried, raising her eyes to Kris. 

“This is my house now,” the dummy rasped, grinning at Lindy as it 
struggled to wriggle out of Kris’ arms. “You will do as I say now. Put me 
down.” 

“What do we do?” Lindy repeated. 

“Take him upstairs. We’ll cut his head off,” Kris replied. 

Mr. Wood swung his head around, his eyes stretched open in an evil 
glare. 

“Ow!” Kris cried out in surprise as the dummy snapped his jaws over 
her arm, biting her. She pulled her arm away and, without thinking, slapped 
the dummy’s wooden head with the palm of her hand. 

The dummy giggled in response. “Violence! Violence!” he said in a 
mock scolding tone. 

“Get those sharp scissors. In your drawer,” Kris instructed her sister. 
“I’ll carry him up to our room.” 

Her arm throbbed where he had bitten her. But she held onto him 
tightly and carried him up to their bedroom. 

Lindy had already pulled the long metal scissors from the drawer. Her 
hand trembled as she opened and closed the blades. 

“Below the neck,” Kris said, holding Mr. Wood tightly by the 
shoulders. 

He hissed furiously at her. She dodged as he tried to kick her with both 
sneakered feet. 

Holding the scissors with two hands, Lindy tried cutting the head off at 
the neck. The scissors didn’t cut, so she tried a sawing motion. 



Mr. Wood giggled. “I told you. You can’t kill me.” 

“It isn’t going to work,” Lindy cried, tears of frustration running down 
her cheeks. “Now what?” 

“We’ll put him in the closet. Then we can think,” Kris replied. 

“You have no need to think. You are my slaves,” the dummy rasped. 
“You will do whatever I ask. I will be in charge from now on.” 

“No way,” Kris muttered, shaking her head. 

“What if we won’t help you?” Lindy demanded. 

The dummy turned to her, casting her a hard, angry stare. “Then I’ll 
start hurting the ones you love,” he said casually. “Your parents. Your 
friends. Or maybe that disgusting dog that’s always yapping at me.” He 
tossed back his head and a dry, evil laugh escaped his wooden lips. 

“Lock him in the closet,” Lindy suggested. “Till we figure out how to 
get rid of him.” 

“You can’t get rid of me,” Mr. Wood insisted. “Don’t make me angry. I 
have powers. I’m warning you. I’m starting to get tired of your stupid 
attempts to harm me.” 

“The closet doesn’t lock—remember?” Kris cried, struggling to hold 
onto the wriggling dummy. 

“Oh. Wait. How about this?” Lindy hurried to the closet. She pulled 
out an old suitcase from the back. 

“Perfect,” Kris said. 

“I’m warning you—” Mr. Wood threatened. “You are becoming very 
tiresome.” 

With a hard tug, he pulled himself free of Kris. 

She dove to tackle him, but he darted out from under her. She fell 
facedown onto her bed. 

The dummy ran to the center of the room, then turned his eyes to the 
doorway, as if trying to decide where to go. “You must do as I tell you,” he 
said darkly, raising a wooden hand toward Lindy. “I will not run from you 
two. You are to be my slaves.” 

“No!” Kris cried, pushing herself up. 

She and her sister both dove at the dummy. Lindy grabbed his arms. 
Kris ducked to grab his ankles. 

Working together, they stuffed him into the open suitcase. 

“You will regret this,” he threatened, kicking his legs, struggling to hit 



them. “You will pay dearly for this. Now someone will die!” He continued 
screaming after Kris latched the suitcase and shoved it into the closet. She 
quickly closed the closet door, then leaned her back against it, sighing 
wearily. 

“Now what?” she asked Lindy. 



22 


“We’ll bury him,” Kris said. 

“Huh?” Lindy stifled a yawn. 

They had been whispering together for what seemed like hours. As 
they tried to come up with a plan, they could hear the dummy’s muffled 
cries from inside the closet. 

“We’ll bury him. Under that huge mound of dirt,” Kris explained, her 
eyes going to the window. “You know. Next door, at the side of the new 
house.” 

“Yeah. Okay. I don’t know,” Lindy replied. “I’m so tired, I can’t think 
straight.” She glanced at the bed table clock. It was nearly three-thirty in the 
morning. “I still think we should wake up Mom and Dad,” Lindy said, fear 
reflected in her eyes. 

“We can’t,” Kris told her. “We’ve been over that a hundred times. 
They won’t believe us. If we wake them up, we’ll be in even bigger 
trouble.” 

“How could we be in bigger trouble?” Lindy demanded, gesturing 
with her head to the closet where Mr. Wood’s angry cries could still be 
heard. 

“Get dressed,” Kris said with renewed energy. “We’ll bury him under 
all that dirt. Then we’ll never have to think about him again.” 

Lindy shuddered and turned her eyes to her dummy, folded up in the 
chair. “I can’t bear to look at Slappy anymore. I’m so sorry I got us 
interested in dummies.” 

“Ssshhh. Just get dressed,” Kris said impatiently. 

A few minutes later, the two girls crept down the stairs in the darkness. Kris 
carried the suitcase in both arms, trying to muffle the sound of Mr. Wood’s 
angry protests. 

They stopped at the bottom of the stairs and listened for any sign that 
they had awakened their parents. 

Silence. 

Lindy pulled open the front door and they slipped outside. 



The air was surprisingly cool and wet. A heavy dew had begun to fall, 
making the front lawn glisten under the light of a half-moon. Blades of wet 
grass clung to their sneakers as they made their way to the garage. 

As Kris held onto the suitcase, Lindy slowly, quietly, pulled open the 
garage door. When it was halfway up, she ducked and slipped inside. 

A few seconds later she emerged, carrying a large snow shovel. “This 
should do it,” she said, whispering even though no one was around. 

Kris glanced down the street as they headed across the yard to the lot 
next door. The heavy morning dew misted the glow of the streetlamps, 
making the pale light appear to bend and flicker like candles. Everything 
seemed to shimmer under the dark purple sky. 

Kris set the suitcase down beside the tall mound of dirt. “We’ll dig 
right down here,” she said, pointing toward the bottom of the mound. 
“We’ll shove him in and cover him.” 

“I’m warning you,” Mr. Wood threatened, listening inside the suitcase. 
“Your plan won’t work. I have powers!” 

“You dig first,” Kris told her sister, ignoring the dummy’s threat. 
“Then I’ll take a turn.” 

Lindy dug into the pile and heaved up a shovelful of dirt. Kris 
shivered. The heavy dew felt cold and damp. A cloud floated over the 
moon, darkening the sky from purple to black. 

“Let me out!” Mr. Wood called. “Let me out now, and your 
punishment won’t be too severe.” 

“Dig faster,” Kris whispered impatiently. 

“I’m going as fast as I can,” Lindy replied. She had dug a pretty good- 
sized square-shaped hole at the base of the mound. “How much deeper, do 
you think?” 

“Deeper,” Kris said. “Here. Watch the suitcase. I’ll take a turn.” She 
changed places with Lindy and started to dig. 

Something scampered heavily near the low shrubs that separated the 
yards. Kris looked up, saw a moving shadow, and gasped. 

“Raccoon, I think,” Lindy said with a shudder. “Are we going to bury 
Mr. Wood in the suitcase, or are we going to take him out?” 

“Think Mom will notice the suitcase is gone?” Kris asked, tossing a 
shovelful of wet dirt to the side. 

Lindy shook her head. “We never use it.” 



“We’ll bury him in the suitcase,” Kris said. “It’ll be easier.” 

“You’ll be sorry,” the dummy rasped. The suitcase shook and nearly 
toppled onto its side. 

“I’m so sleepy,” Lindy moaned, tossing her socks onto the floor, then 
sliding her feet under the covers. 

“I’m wide awake,” Kris replied, sitting on the edge of her bed. “I guess 
it’s because I’m so happy. So happy we got rid of that awful creature.” 

“It’s all so weird,” Lindy said, adjusting her pillow behind her head. “I 
don’t blame Mom or Dad for not believing it. I’m not sure I believe it, 
either.” 

“You put the shovel back where you found it?” Kris asked. 

Lindy nodded. “Yeah,” she said sleepily. 

“And you closed the garage door?” 

“Ssshhh. I’m asleep,” Lindy said. “At least there’s no school 
tomorrow. We can sleep late.” 

“I hope I can fall asleep,” Kris said doubtfully. “I’m just so pumped. 
It’s all like some kind of hideously gross nightmare. I just think... Lindy? 
Lindy—are you still awake?” 

No. Her sister had fallen asleep. 

Kris stared up at the ceiling. She pulled the blankets up to her chin. 
She still felt chilled. She couldn’t shake the cold dampness of the early 
morning air. 

After a short while, with thoughts of everything that had happened that 
night whirring crazily in her head, Kris fell asleep, too. 

The rumble of machines woke her up at eight-thirty the next morning. 
Stretching, trying to rub the sleep from her eyes, Kris stumbled to the 
window, leaned over the chair holding Slappy, and peered out. 

It was a gray, cloudy day. Two enormous yellow steamrollers were 
rolling over the lot next door behind the newly constructed house, flattening 
the land. 

I wonder if they’re going to flatten that big mound of dirt, Kris 
thought, staring down at them. That would really be excellent. 

Kris smiled. She hadn’t slept very long, but she felt refreshed. 

Lindy was still sound asleep. Kris tiptoed past her, pulled her robe on, 
and headed downstairs. 



“Morning, Mom,” she called brightly, tying the belt to her robe as she 
entered the kitchen. 

Mrs. Powell turned from the sink to face her. Kris was surprised to see 
an angry expression on her face. 

She followed her mother’s stare to the breakfast counter. 

“Oh!” Kris gasped when she saw Mr. Wood. He was seated at the 
counter, his hands in his lap. His hair was matted with red-brown dirt, and 
he had dirt smears on his cheeks and forehead. 

Kris raised her hands to her face in horror. 

“I thought you were told never to bring that thing down here!” Mrs. 
Powell scolded. “What do I have to do, Kris?” She turned angrily back to 
the sink. 

The dummy winked at Kris and flashed her a wide, evil grin. 



23 


As Kris stared in horror at the grinning dummy, Mr. Powell suddenly 
appeared in the kitchen doorway. “Ready?” he asked his wife. 

Mrs. Powell hung the dishtowel on the rack and turned around, 
brushing a lock of hair off her forehead. “Ready. I’ll get my bag.” She 
brushed past him into the front hallway. 

“Where are you going?” Kris cried, her voice revealing her alarm. She 
kept her eyes on the dummy at the counter. 

“Just doing a little shopping at the garden store,” her father told her, 
stepping into the room, peering out the kitchen window. “Looks like rain.” 

“Don’t go!” Kris pleaded. 

“Huh?” He turned toward her. 

“Don’t go—please!” Kris cried. 

Her father’s eyes landed on the dummy. He walked over to him. “Hey 
—what’s the big idea?” her father asked angrily. 

“I thought you wanted to take him back to the pawn shop,” Kris 
replied, thinking quickly. 

“Not till Monday,” her father replied. “Today is Saturday, remember?” 

The dummy blinked. Mr. Powell didn’t notice. 

“Do you have to go shopping now?” Kris asked in a tiny voice. 

Before her father could answer, Mrs. Powell reappeared in the 
doorway. “Here. Catch,” she called, and tossed the car keys to him. “Let’s 
go before it pours.” 

Mr. Powell started to the door. “Why don’t you want us to go?” he 
asked. 

“The dummy—” Kris started. But she knew it was hopeless. They’d 
never listen. They’d never believe her. “Never mind,” she muttered. 

A few seconds later, she heard their car back down the driveway. They 
were gone. 

And she was alone in the kitchen with the grinning dummy. 

Mr. Wood turned toward her slowly, swiveling the tall counter stool. 
His big eyes locked angrily on Kris’. 

“I warned you,” he rasped. 



Barky came trotting into the kitchen, his toenails clicking loudly on the 
linoleum. He sniffed the floor as he ran, searching for breakfast scraps 
someone might have dropped. 

“Barky, where’ve you been?” Kris asked, glad to have company. 

The dog ignored her and sniffed under the stool Mr. Wood sat on. 

“He was upstairs, waking me up,” Lindy said, rubbing her eyes as she 
walked into the kitchen. She was wearing white tennis shorts and a 
sleeveless magenta T-shirt. “Stupid dog.” 

Barky licked at a spot on the linoleum. 

Lindy cried out as she spotted Mr. Wood. “Oh, no!” 

“I’m back,” the dummy rasped. “And I’m very unhappy with you two 
slaves.” 

Lindy turned to Kris, her mouth open in surprise and terror. 

Kris kept her eyes trained on the dummy. What does he plan to do? 
she wondered. How can I stop him? 

Burying him under all that dirt hadn’t kept him from returning. 
Somehow he had freed himself from the suitcase and pulled himself out. 

Wasn’t there any way to defeat him? Any way at all? 

Grinning his evil grin, Mr. Wood dropped down to the floor, his 
sneakers thudding hard on the floor. “I’m very unhappy with you two 
slaves,” he repeated in his growly voice. 

“What are you going to do?” Lindy cried in a shrill, frightened voice. 

“I have to punish you,” the dummy replied. “I have to prove to you 
that I am serious.” 

“Wait!” Kris cried. 

But the dummy moved quickly. He reached down and grabbed Barky 
by the neck with both hands. 

As the dummy tightened his grip, the frightened terrier began to howl 
in pain. 



24 


“I warned you,” Mr. Wood snarled over the howls of the little black terrier. 
“You will do as I say—or one by one, those you love will suffer!” 

“No!” Kris cried. 

Barky let out a high-pitched whelp, a bleat of pain that made Kris 
shudder. 

“Let go of Barky!” Kris screamed. 

The dummy giggled. 

Barky uttered a hoarse gasp. 

Kris couldn’t stand it any longer. She and Lindy leapt at the dummy 
from two sides. Lindy tackled his legs. Kris grabbed Barky and tugged. 

Lindy dragged the dummy to the floor. But his wooden hands held a 
tight grip on the dog’s throat. 

Barky’s howls became a muffled whimper as he struggled to breathe. 

“Let go! Let go!” Kris shrieked. 

“I warned you!” the dummy snarled as Lindy held tight to his kicking 
legs. “The dog must die now!” 

“No!” Kris let go of the gasping dog. She slid her hands down to the 
dummy’s wrists. Then with a fierce tug, she pulled the wooden hands apart. 

Barky dropped to the floor, wheezing. He scampered to the corner, his 
paws sliding frantically over the smooth floor. 

“You’ll pay now!” Mr. Wood growled. Jerking free from Kris, he 
swung his wooden hand up, landing a hard blow on Kris’ forehead. 

She cried out in pain and raised her hands to her head. 

She heard Barky yipping loudly behind her. 

“Let go of me!” Mr. Wood demanded, turning back to Lindy, who still 
held onto his legs. 

“No way!” Lindy cried. “Kris—grab his arms again.” 

Her head still throbbing, Kris lunged forward to grab the dummy’s 
arms. 

But he lowered his head as she approached and clamped his wooden 
jaws around her wrist. 



“Owww!” Kris howled in pain and pulled back. 

Lindy lifted the dummy up by the legs, then slammed his body hard 
against the floor. He uttered a furious growl and tried to kick free of her. 

Kris lunged again, and this time grabbed one arm, then the other. He 
lowered his head to bite once more, but she dodged away and pulled his 
arms tight behind his back. 

“I’m warning you!” he bellowed. “I’m warning you!” 

Barky yipped excitedly, hopping up on Kris. 

“What do we do with him?” Lindy cried, shouting over the dummy’s 
angry threats. 

“Outside!” Kris yelled, pressing the arms more tightly behind Mr. 
Wood’s back. 

She suddenly remembered the two steamrollers she had seen moving 
over the yard next door, flattening the ground. “Come on,” she urged her 
sister. “We’ll crush him!” 

“I’m warning you! I have powers!” the dummy screamed. 

Ignoring him, Kris pulled open the kitchen door and they carried their 
wriggling captive outside. 

The sky was charcoal-gray. A light rain had begun to fall. The grass 
was already wet. 

Over the low shrubs that separated the yards, the girls could see the 
two enormous yellow steamrollers, one in the back, one at the side of the 
next-door lot. They looked like huge, lumbering animals, their giant black 
rollers flattening everything in their path. 

“This way! Hurry!” Kris shouted to her sister, holding the dummy 
tightly as she ran. “Toss him under that one! ” 

“Let me go! Let me go, slaves!” the dummy screamed. “This is your 
last chance!” He swung his head hard, trying to bite Kris’ arm. 

Thunder rumbled, low in the distance. 

The girls ran at full speed, slipping on the wet grass as they hurried 
toward the fast-moving steamroller. 

They were just a few yards away from the enormous machine when 
they saw Barky. His tail wagging furiously, he scampered ahead of them. 

“Oh, no! How’d he get out?” Lindy cried. 

Gazing back at them, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, prancing 
happily in the wet grass, the dog was running right into the path of the 



rumbling steamroller. 

“No, Barky!” Kris shrieked in horror. “No! Barky—no!” 



25 


Letting go of Mr. Wood, both girls dove toward the dog. Hands 
outstretched, they slid on their stomachs on the wet grass. 

Unaware of any problem, enjoying the game of tag, Barky scampered 
away. 

Lindy and Kris rolled out of the path of the steamroller. 

“Hey—get away from there!” the angry operator shouted through the 
high window of the steamroller. “Are you girls crazy?” 

They leapt to their feet and turned back to Mr. Wood. 

The rain began to come down a little harder. A jagged streak of white 
lightning flashed high in the sky. 

“I’m free!” the dummy cried, hands raised victoriously above his head. 
“Now you will pay!” 

“Get him!” Kris shouted to her sister. 

The rain pelted their hair and shoulders. The two girls lowered their 
heads, leaned into the rain, and began to chase after the dummy. 

Mr. Wood turned and started to run. 

He never saw the other steamroller. 

The gigantic black wheel rolled right over him, pushing him onto his 
back, then crushing him with a loud crunch. 

A loud hiss rose up from under the machine, like air escaping from a 
large balloon. 

The steamroller appeared to rock back and forth. 

A strange green gas spurted up from beneath the wheel, into the air, 
spreading out in an eerie, mushroom-shaped cloud. 

Barky stopped scampering and stood frozen in place, his eyes 
following the green gas as it floated up against the nearly black sky. 

Lindy and Kris stared in open mouthed wonder. 

Pushed by the wind and the rain, the green gas floated over them. 

“Yuck! It stinks!” Lindy declared. 

It smelled like rotten eggs. 

Barky uttered a low whimper. 



The steamroller backed up. The driver jumped out and came running 
toward them. He was a short, stocky man with big, muscular arms bulging 
out from the sleeves of his T-shirt. His face was bright red under a short, 
blond flattop, his eyes wide with horror. 

“A kid?” he cried. “I—I ran over a kid?” 

“No. He was a dummy,” Kris told him. “He wasn’t alive.” 

He stopped. His face faded from red to flour-white. He uttered a loud, 
grateful sigh. “Oh, man,” he moaned. “Oh, man. I thought it was a kid.” 

He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Then he bent to examine 
the area beneath his wheel. As the girls came near, they saw the remains of 
the dummy, crushed flat inside its jeans and flannel shirt. 

“Hey, I’m real sorry,” the man said, wiping his forehead with his T- 
shirt sleeve as he straightened up to face them. “I couldn’t stop in time.” 

“That’s okay,” Kris said, a wide smile forming on her face. 

“Yeah. Really. It’s okay,” Lindy quickly agreed. 

Barky moved close to sniff the crushed dummy. 

The man shook his head. “I’m so relieved. It looked like it was 
running. I really thought it was a kid. I was so scared.” 

“No. Just a dummy,” Kris told him. 

“Whew!” The man exhaled slowly. “Close one.” His expression 
changed. “What are you girls doing out in the rain, anyway?” 

Lindy shrugged. Kris shook her head. “Just walking the dog.” 

The man picked up the crushed dummy. The head crumbled to powder 
as he lifted it. “You want this thing?” 

“You can throw it in the trash,” Kris told him. 

“Better get out of the rain,” he told them. “And don’t scare me like that 
again.” 

The girls apologized, then headed back to the house. Kris cast a happy 
grin at her sister. Lindy grinned back. 

I may grin forever, Kris thought. I’m so happy. So relieved. 

They wiped their wet sneakers on the mat, then held the kitchen door 
open for Barky. “Wow. What a morning!” Lindy declared. 

They followed the dog into the kitchen. Outside, a flash of bright 
lightning was followed by a roar of thunder. 

“I’m drenched,” Kris said. “I’m going up to get changed.” 

“Me, too.” Lindy followed her up the stairs. 



They entered their bedroom to find the window wide open, the curtains 
slapping wildly, rain pouring in. “Oh, no!” Kris hurried across the room to 
shut the window. 

As she leaned over the chair to grab the window frame, Slappy 
reached up and grabbed her arm. 

“Hey, slave—is that other guy gone?” the dummy asked in a throaty 
growl. “I thought he’d never leave!” 






THE GIRL WHO 
CRIED MONSTER 
Goosebumps - 08 
R.L. Stine 


1 


I love to scare my little brother, Randy. I tell him scary stories about monsters 
until he begs me to stop. And I’m always teasing him by pretending to see 
monsters everywhere. 

I guess that’s why no one believed me the day I saw a real monster. 

I guess that’s why no one believed me until it was too late, and the monster 
was right in my own house. 

But I’d better not tell the ending of my story at the beginning. 

My name is Lucy Dark. I’m twelve. I live with my brother, Randy, who is 
six, and my parents in a medium-sized house in a medium-sized town called 
Timberland Falls. 

I don’t know why it’s called Timberland Falls. There are a few forests 
outside of town, but no one cuts the trees down for timber. And there aren’t any 
falls. 

So, why Timberland Falls? 

It’s a mystery. 

We have a redbrick house at the end of our street. There’s a tall, overgrown 
hedge that runs along the side of our house and separates our yard from the 
Killeens’ yard next door. Dad’s always talking about how he should trim the 
hedge, but he never does. 

We have a small front yard and a pretty big back yard with a lot of tall, old 
trees in it. There’s an old sassafras tree in the middle of the yard. It’s cool and 
shady under the tree. That’s where I like to sit with Randy when there’s nothing 
better to do, and see if I can scare the socks off of him! 

It isn’t very hard. Randy scares easy. 

He looks a lot like me, even though he’s a boy. He’s got straight black hair 
just like me, only I wear mine longer. He’s short for his age, like me, and just a 
little bit chubby. 

He has a round face, rounder than mine, and big black eyes, which really 
stand out since we both have such pale white skin. 

Mom says Randy has longer eyelashes than mine, which makes me kind of 
jealous. But my nose is straighter, and my teeth don’t stick out as much when I 
smile. So I guess I shouldn’t complain. 



Anyway, on a hot afternoon a couple of weeks ago, Randy and I were 
sitting under the old sassafras tree, and I was getting ready to scare him to death. 

I really didn’t have anything better to do. As soon as summer came around 
this year and school let out, most of my really good friends went away for the 
summer. I was stuck at home, and so I was pretty lonely. 

Randy is usually a total pain. But at least he is somebody to talk to. And 
someone I can scare. 

I have a really good imagination. I can dream up the most amazing 
monsters. And I can make them sound really real. 

Mom says with my imagination, maybe I’ll be a writer when I grow up. 

I really don’t know about that. 

I do know that it doesn’t take a whole lot of imagination to frighten Randy. 

Usually all I have to do is tell him there’s a monster trying on his clothes 
upstairs in his closet, and Randy turns even whiter than normal and starts 
shaking all over. 

The poor kid. I can even make his teeth chatter. It’s unbelievable. 

I leaned back against the smooth part of the tree trunk and rested my hands 
on the grass, and closed my eyes. I was dreaming up a good story to tell my 
brother. 

The grass felt soft and moist against my bare feet. I dug my toes into the 

dirt. 

Randy was wearing denim shorts and a plain white sleeveless T-shirt. He 
was lying on his side, plucking up blades of grass with one hand. 

“Did you ever hear about the Timberland Falls toe-biter?” I asked him, 
brushing a spider off my white tennis shorts. 

“Huh?” He kept pulling up blades of grass one by one, making a little pile. 

“There was this monster called the Timberland Falls toe-biter,” I told 
Randy. 

“Aw, please, Lucy,” he whined. “You said you wouldn’t make up any more 
monster stories.” 

“No, I’m not!” I told him. “This story isn’t made up. It’s true.” 

He looked up at me and made a face. “Yeah. Sure.” 

“No. Really,” I insisted, staring hard into his round, black eyes so he’d 
know I was sincere. “This is a true story. It really happened. Here. In Timberland 
Falls.” 

Randy pulled himself up to a sitting position. “I think I’ll go inside and read 



comic books,” he said, tossing down a handful of grass. 

Randy has a big comic book collection. But they’re all Disney comics and 
Archie comics because the superhero comics are too scary for him. 

“The toe-biter showed up one day right next door,” I told Randy. I knew 
once I started the story, he wouldn’t leave. 

“At the Killeens’?” he asked, his eyes growing wide. 

“Yeah. He arrived in the middle of the afternoon. The toe-biter isn’t a night 
monster, you see. He’s a day monster. He strikes when the sun is high in the sky. 
Just like now.” 

I pointed up through the shimmering tree leaves to the sun, which was high 
overhead in a clear summer-blue sky. 

“A d-day monster?” Randy asked. He turned his head to look at the 
Killeens’ house rising up on the other side of the hedge. 

“Don’t be scared. It happened a couple of summers ago,” I continued. 
“Becky and Lilah were over there. They were swimming. You know. In that 
plastic pool their mom inflates for them. The one that half the water always 
spills out.” 

“And a monster came?” Randy asked. 

“A toe-biter,” I told him, keeping my expression very serious and lowering 
my voice nearly to a whisper. “A toe-biter came crawling across their back 
yard.” 

“Where’d he come from?” Randy asked, leaning forward. 

I shrugged. “No one knows. You see, the thing about toe-biters is they’re 
very hard to see when they crawl across grass. Because they make themselves 
the exact color of the grass.” 

“You mean they’re green?” Randy asked, rubbing his pudgy nose. 

I shook my head. “They’re only green when they creep and crawl over the 
grass,” I replied. “They change their color to match what they’re walking on. So 
you can’t see them.” 

“Well, how big is it?” Randy asked thoughtfully. 

“Big,” I said. “Bigger than a dog.” I watched an ant crawl up my leg, then 
flicked if off. “No one really knows how big because this monster blends in so 
well.” 

“So what happened?” Randy asked, sounding a little breathless. “I mean to 
Becky and Lilah.” Again he glanced over at the Killeens’ gray-shingle house. 

“Well, they were in their little plastic pool,” I continued. “You know. 



Splashing around. And I guess Becky was lying on her back and had her feet 
hanging over the side of the pool. And the monster scampered over the grass, 
nearly invisible. And it saw Becky’s toes dangling in the air.” 

“And—and Becky didn’t see the monster?” Randy asked. 

I could see he was starting to get real pale and trembly. 

“Toe-biters are just so hard to see,” I said, keeping my eyes locked on 
Randy’s, keeping my face very straight and solemn. 

I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Just to build up suspense. Then I 
continued the story. 

“Becky didn’t notice anything at first. Then she felt a kind of tickling 
feeling. She thought it was the dog licking at her toes. She kicked a little and told 
the dog to go away. 

“But then it didn’t tickle so much. It started to hurt. Becky shouted for the 
dog to stop. But the hurting got even worse. It felt like the dog was chewing on 
her toes, with very sharp teeth. 

“It started to hurt a whole lot. So Becky sat up and pulled her feet into the 
pool. And... when she looked down at her left foot, she saw it.” 

I stopped and waited for Randy to ask. 

“Wh-what?” he asked finally, in a shaky voice. “What did she see?” 

I leaned forward and brought my mouth close to his ear. “All the toes were 
missing from her left foot,” I whispered. 

“No!” Randy screamed. He jumped to his feet. He was as pale as a ghost, 
and he looked really scared. “That’s not true!” 

I shook my head solemnly. I forced myself not to crack a smile. “Ask 
Becky to take off her left shoe,” I told him. “You’ll see.” 

“No! You’re lying!” Randy wailed. 

“Ask her,” I said softly. 

And then I glanced down at my feet, and my eyes popped wide with horror. 
“R-R-Randy—look!” I stammered and pointed with a trembling hand down to 
my feet. 

Randy uttered a deafening scream when he saw what I was pointing at. 

All the toes on my left foot were missing.

“Waaaauiii!” 

Randy let out another terrified wail. Then he took off, running full speed to 
the house, crying for Mom. 

I took off after him. I didn’t want to get in trouble for scaring him again. 

“Randy—wait! Wait! I’m okay!” I shouted, laughing. 

Of course I had my toes buried in the dirt. 

He should’ve been able to figure that out. 

But he was too scared to think straight. 

“Wait!” I called after him. “I didn’t get to show you the monster in the 
tree!” 

He heard that. He stopped and turned around, his face still all twisted up in 
fright. “Huh?” 

“There’s a monster up in the tree,” I said, pointing to the sassafras tree we’d 
just been sitting under. “A tree monster. I saw it!” 

“No way!” he screamed, and started mnning again to the house. 

“I’ll show it to you!” I called, cupping my hands around my mouth so he’d 
hear me. 

He didn’t look back. I watched him stumble up the steps to the back stoop 
and disappear into the house. The screen door slammed hard behind him. 

I stood staring at the back of the house, waiting for Randy to poke his 
frightened head out again. But he didn’t. 

I burst out laughing. I mean, the toe-biter was one of my best creations. 
And then digging my toes into the dirt and pretending the monster had gotten 
me, too —what a hot! 

Poor Randy. He was just too easy a victim. 

And now he was probably in the kitchen, squealing on me to Mom. That 
meant that real soon I’d be in for another lecture about how it wasn’t nice to 
scare my little brother and fill him full of scary monster stories. 

But what else was there to do? 

I stood there staring at the house, waiting for one of them to call me in. 
Suddenly a hand grabbed my shoulder hard from behind. “Gotcha!” a voice 
growled. 




“Oh!” I cried out and nearly jumped out of my skin. 

A monster! 

I spun around—and stared at the laughing face of my friend Aaron Messer. 

Aaron giggled his high-pitched giggle till he had tears in his eyes. 

I shook my head, frowning. “You didn’t scare me,” I insisted. 

“Oh. Sure,” he replied, rolling his blue eyes. “That’s why you screamed for 
help!” 

“I didn ’t scream for help,” I protested. “I just cried out a little. In surprise. 
That’s all.” 

Aaron chuckled. “You thought it was a monster. Admit it.” 

“A monster?” I said, sneering. “Why would I think that?” 

“Because that’s all you think about,” he said smugly. “You’re obsessed.” 

“Oooh. Big word!” I teased him. 

He made a face at me. Aaron is my only friend who stuck around this 
summer. His parents are taking him somewhere out west in a few months. But in 
the meantime he’s stuck like me, just hanging out, trying to fill the time. 

Aaron is about a foot taller than me. But who isn’t? He has curly red hair 
and freckles all over his face. He’s very skinny, and he wears long, baggy shorts 
that make him look even skinnier. 

“I just saw Randy run into the house. Why was he crying like that?” Aaron 
asked, glancing to the house. 

I could see Randy at the kitchen window, staring out at us. 

“I think he saw a monster,” I told Aaron. 

“Huh? Not monsters again!” Aaron cried. He gave me a playful shove. “Get 
out of here, Lucy!” 

“There’s one up in that tree,” I said seriously, pointing. 

Aaron turned around to look. “You’re so dumb,” he said, grinning. 

“No. Really,” I insisted. “There’s a real ugly monster. I think it’s trapped up 
there in that tree.” 

“Lucy, stop it,” Aaron said. 

“That’s what Randy saw,” I continued. “That’s what made him run 
screaming into the house.” 

“You see monsters everywhere,” Aaron said. “Don’t you ever get tired of 

it?” 

“I’m not kidding this time,” I told him. My chin trembled, and my 
expression turned to outright fear as I gazed over Aaron’s shoulder at the broad, 



leafy sassafras tree. “I’ll prove it to you.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Aaron replied with his usual sarcasm. 

“Really. Go get that broom.” I motioned to the broom leaning against the 
back of the house. 

“Huh? What for?” Aaron asked. 

“Go get the broom,” I insisted. “We’ll see if we can get the monster down 
from the tree.” 

“Uh... why do we want to do that?” Aaron asked. He sounded very 
hesitant. I could see that he was starting to wonder if I was being serious or not. 

“So you’ll believe me,” I said seriously. 

“I don’t believe in monsters,” Aaron replied. “You know that, Lucy. Save 
your monster stories for Randy. He’s just a kid.” 

“Will you believe me if one drops out of that tree?” I asked. 

“Nothing is going to drop out of that tree. Except maybe some leaves,” 
Aaron said. 

“Go get the broom and we’ll see,” I said. 

“Okay. Fine.” He went trotting toward the house. 

I grabbed the broom out of his hand when he brought it over. “Come on,” I 
said, leading the way to the tree. “I hope the monster hasn’t climbed away.” 

Aaron rolled his eyes. “I can’t believe I’m going along with this, Lucy. I 
must be really bored!” 

“You won’t be bored in a second,” I promised. “If the tree monster is still 
up there.” 

We stepped into the shade of the tree. I moved close to the trunk and gazed 
up into its leafy green branches. “Whoa. Stay right there.” I put my hand on 
Aaron’s chest, holding him back. “It could be dangerous.” 

“Give me a break,” he muttered under his breath. 

“I’ll try to shake the branch and bring it down,” I said. 

“Let me get this straight,” Aaron said. “You expect me to believe that 
you’re going to take the broom, shake a tree branch, and a monster is going to 
come tumbling down from up there?” 

“Uh-huh.” I could see that the broom handle wasn’t quite long enough to 
reach. “I’m going to have to climb up a little,” I told Aaron. “Just watch out, 
okay?” 

“Ooh, I’m shaking. I’m soooo scared!” Aaron cried, making fun of me. 

I shimmied up the trunk and pulled myself onto the lowest limb. It took me 



a while because I had the broom in one hand. 

“See any scary monsters up there?” Aaron asked smugly. 

“It’s up there,” I called down, fear creeping into my voice. “It’s trapped up 
there. It’s... very angry, I think.” 

Aaron snickered. “You’re so dumb.” 

I pulled myself up to a kneeling position on the limb. Then I raised the 
broom in front of me. 

I lifted it up to the next branch. Higher. Higher. 

Then, holding on tightly to the trunk with my free hand, I raised the broom 
as far as it would go—and pushed it against the tree limb. 

Success! 

I lowered my eyes immediately to watch Aaron. 

He let out a deafening shriek of horror as the monster toppled from the tree 
and landed right on his chest. 



3 


Well, actually it wasn’t a monster that landed with a soft, crackly thud on 
Aaron’s chest. 

It was a ratty old bird’s nest that some blue jays had built two springs ago. 

But Aaron wasn’t expecting it. So it gave him a really good scare. 

“Gotcha!” I proclaimed after climbing down from the tree. 

He scowled at me. His face was a little purple, which made his freckles 
look really weird. “You and your monsters,” he muttered. 

That’s exactly what my mom said about ten minutes later. Aaron had gone 
home, and I’d come into the kitchen and pulled a box of juice out of the fridge. 

Sure enough, Mom appeared in the doorway, her eyes hard and steely, her 
expression grim. I could see right away that she was ready to give her “Don’t 
Scare Randy” lecture. 

I leaned back against the counter and pretended to listen. The basic idea of 
the lecture was that my stories were doing permanent harm to my delicate little 
brother. That I should be encouraging Randy to be brave instead of making him 
terrified that monsters lurked in every corner. 

“But, Mom—I saw a real monster under the hedge this morning!” I said. 

I don’t really know why I said that. I guess I just wanted to interrupt the 
lecture. 

Mom got really exasperated. She threw up her hands and sighed. She has 
straight, shiny black hair, like Randy and me, and she has green eyes, cat eyes, 
and a small, feline nose. Whenever Mom starts in on me with one of her lectures, 
I always picture her as a cat about to pounce. 

Don’t get me wrong. She’s very pretty. And she’s a good mom, too. 

“I’m going to discuss this with your dad tonight,” she said. “Your dad 
thinks this monster obsession is just a phase you’re going through. But I’m not 
so sure.” 

“Life is just a phase I’m going through,” I said softly. 

I thought it was pretty clever. But she just glared at me. 

Then she reminded me that if I didn’t hurry, I’d be late for my Reading 
Rangers meeting. 

I glanced at the clock. She was right. My appointment was for four o’clock. 



Reading Rangers is a summer reading program at the town library that 
Mom and Dad made me enroll in. They said they didn’t want me to waste the 
whole summer. And if I joined this thing at the library, at least I’d read some 
good books. 

The way Reading Rangers works is, I have to go see Mr. Mortman, the 
librarian, once a week. And I have to give a short report and answer some 
questions about the book I read that week. I get a gold star for every book I 
report on. 

If I get six gold stars, I get a prize. I think the prize is a book. Big deal, 
right? But it’s just a way to make you read. 

I thought I’d read some of the scary mystery novels that all my friends are 
reading. But no way. Mr. Mortman insists on everyone reading “classics”. He 
means old books. 

“I’m going to skate over,” I told my mom, and hurried to my room to get 
my Rollerblades. 

“You’d better fly over!” my mom called up to me. “Hey,” she added a few 
seconds later, “it looks like rain!” 

She was always giving me weather reports. 

I passed by Randy’s room. He was in there in the dark, no lights, the shades 
pulled. Playing Super Nintendo, as usual. 

By the time I got my Rollerblades laced and tied, I had only five minutes to 
get to the library. Luckily, it was only six or seven blocks away. 

I was in big trouble anyway. I had managed to read only four chapters of 
Huckleberry Finn, my book for the week. That meant I was going to have to 
fake it with Mr. Mortman. 

I picked the book up from my shelf. It was a new paperback. I wrinkled up 
some of the pages near the back to make it look as if I’d read that far. I tucked it 
into my backpack, along with a pair of sneakers. Then I made my way down the 
stairs—not easy in Rollerblades—and headed to the Timberland Falls town 
library. 

The library was in a ramshackle old house on the edge of the Timberland 
woods. The house had belonged to some eccentric old hermit. And when he 
died, he had no family, so he donated the house to the town. They turned it into a 
library. 

Some kids said the house had been haunted. But kids say that about every 
creepy old house. The library did look like a perfect haunted house, though. 



It was three stories tall, dark shingled, with a dark, pointy roof between two 
stone turrets. The house was set back in the trees, as if hiding there. It was 
always in the shade, always dark and cold inside. 

Inside, the old floorboards creaked beneath the thin carpet the town had put 
down. The high windows let in very little light. And the old wooden bookcases 
reached nearly to the ceiling. When I edged my way through the narrow aisles 
between the tall, dark shelves, I always felt as if they were about to close in on 
me. 

I had this frightening feeling that the shelves would lean in on me, cover me 
up, and I’d be buried there in the darkness forever. Buried under a thousand 
pounds of dusty, mildewy old books. 

But of course that’s silly. 

It was just a very old house. Very dark and damp. Very creaky. Not as clean 
as a library should be. Lots of cobwebs and dust. 

Mr. Mortman did his best, I guess. But he was kind of creepy, too. 

The thing all of us kids hated the most about him was that his hands always 
seemed to be wet. He would smile at you with those beady little black eyes of 
his lighting up on his plump, bald head. He would reach out and shake your 
hand. And his hand was always sopping! 

When he turned the pages of books, he’d leave wet fingerprints on the 
corners. His desktop always had small puddles on the top, moist handprints on 
the leather desk protector. 

He was short and round. With that shiny, bald head and those tiny black 
eyes, he looked a lot like a mole. A wet-pawed mole. 

He spoke in a high, scratchy voice. Nearly always whispered. He wasn’t a 
bad guy, really. He seemed to like kids. He wasn’t mean or anything. And he 
really liked books. 

He was just weird, that’s all. He sat on a tall wooden stool that made him 
hover over his enormous desk. He kept a deep aluminum pan on the side of his 
desk. Inside the pan were several little turtles, moving around in about an inch of 
water. “My timid friends,” I heard him call them once. 

Sometimes he’d pick up one of them and hold it in his pudgy fingers, high 
in the air, until it tucked itself into its shell. Then he’d gently set it down, a 
pleased smile on his pale, flabby face. 

He sure loved his turtles. I guess they were okay as pets. But they were kind 
of smelly. I always tried to sit on the other side of the desk, as far away from the 



turtle pan as I could get. 

Well, I skated to the library as fast as I could. I was only a few minutes late 
when I skated into the cool shade of the library driveway. The sky was clouding 
over. I sat down on the stone steps and pulled off the Rollerblades. Then I 
quickly slid into my sneakers and, carrying my Rollerblades, I walked through 
the front door. 

Making my way through the stacks—the tall, narrow shelves at the back of 
the main reading room—I dropped the skates against the wall. Then I walked 
quickly through the aisles to Mr. Mortman’s desk against the back wall. 

He heard my footsteps and immediately glanced up from the pile of books 
he was stamping with a big rubber stamp. The ceiling light made his bald head 
shine like a lamp. He smiled. “Hi, Lucy,” he said in his squeaky voice. “Be right 
with you.” 

I said hi and sat down in the folding chair in front of his desk. I watched 
him stamp the books. He was wearing a gray turtleneck sweater, which made 
him look a lot like his pet turtles. 

Finally, after glancing at the big, loudly ticking clock on the wall, he turned 
to me. 

“And what did you read for Reading Rangers this week, Lucy?” He leaned 
over the desk toward me. I could see wet fingerprints on the dark desktop. 

“Uh... Huckleberry Finn.” I pulled the book from my backpack and 
dropped it into my lap. 

“Yes, yes. A wonderful book,” Mr. Mortman said, glancing at the paperback 
in my lap. “Don’t you agree?” 

“Yes,” I said quickly. “I really enjoyed it. I... couldn’t put it down.” 

That was sort of true. I never picked it up—so how could I put it down? 

“What did you like best about Huckleberry Finn?” Mr. Mortman asked, 
smiling at me expectantly. 

“Uh... the description,” I told him. 

I had my Reading Rangers gold star in my T-shirt pocket. And I had a new book 
in my backpack— Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley. 

Maybe I’ll read Frankenstein out loud to Randy, I thought evilly. 

That would probably make his teeth chatter forever! 

The late afternoon sun was hidden behind spreading rain clouds. I had 
walked nearly all the way home when I realized I had forgotten my Rollerblades. 



So I turned around and went back. I wasn’t sure how late the library stayed 
open. Mr. Mortman had seemed to be entirely alone in there. I hoped he hadn’t 
decided to close up shop early. I really didn’t want to leave my new Rollerblades 
in there overnight. 

I stopped and stared up at the old library. Deep in the shade, it seemed to 
stare back at me, its dark windows like black, unblinking eyes. 

I climbed the stone steps, then hesitated with my hand on the door. I had a 
sudden chill. 

Was it just from stepping into the deep shade? 

No. It was something else. 

I had a funny feeling. A bad feeling. 

I get those sometimes. A signal. A moment of unease. 

Like something bad is about to happen. 

Shaking it off, I pushed open the creaking old door and stepped into the 
musty darkness of the library.

Shadows danced across the wall as I made my way to the main room. A tree 
branch tapped noisily against the dust-covered pane of a high window. 

The library was silent except for the creaking floorboards beneath my 
sneakers. As I entered the main room, I could hear the steady tick-tick-tick of the 
wall clock. 

The lights had all been turned off. 

I thought I felt something scamper across my shoe. 

A mouse? 

I stopped short and glanced down. 

Just a dustball clinging to the base of a bookshelf. 

Whoa, Lucy, I scolded myself. It’s just a dusty old library. Nothing to get 
weird about. Don’t let your wild imagination take off and lead you into trouble. 

Trouble? 

I still had that strange feeling. A gentle but insistent gnawing at my 
stomach. A tug at my chest. 

Something isn’t right. Something bad is about to happen. 

People call them premonitions. It’s a good vocabulary word for what I was 
feeling right then. 

I found my Rollerblades where I had left them, against the wall back in the 
stacks. I grabbed them up, eager to get out of that dark, creepy place. 

I headed quickly back toward the entrance, tiptoeing for some reason. But a 
sound made me stop. 

I held my breath. And listened. 

It was just a cough. 

Peering down the narrow aisle, I could see Mr. Mortman hovered over his 
desk. Well, actually, I could just see part of him—one arm, and some of his face 
when he leaned to the left. 

I was still holding my breath. 

The clock tick-tick-ticked noisily from across the room. Behind his desk, 
Mr. Mortman’s face moved in and out of blue-purple shadows. 

The Rollerblades suddenly felt heavy. I lowered them silently to the floor. 
Then my curiosity got the better of me, and I took a few steps toward the front. 



Mr. Mortman began humming to himself. I didn’t recognize the song. 

The shadows grew deeper as I approached. Peering down the dark aisle, I 
saw him holding a large glass jar between his pudgy hands. I was close enough 
to see that he had a pleasant smile on his face. 

Keeping in the shadows, I moved closer. 

I like spying on people. It’s kind of thrilling, even when they don’t do 
anything very interesting. 

Just knowing that you’re watching them and they don’t know they’re being 
watched is exciting. 

Humming to himself, Mr. Mortman held the jar in front of his chest and 
started to unscrew the top. “Some juicy flies, my timid friends,” he announced in 
his high-pitched voice. 

So. The jar was filled with flies. 

Suddenly, the room grew much darker as clouds rolled over the late 
afternoon sun. The light from the window dimmed. Gray shadows rolled over 
Mr. Mortman and his enormous desk, as if blanketing him in darkness. 

From my hidden perch among the shelves, I watched him prepare to feed 
his turtles. 

But wait. 

Something was wrong. 

My premonition was coming true. 

Something weird was happening! 

As he struggled to unscrew the jar lid, Mr. Mortman’s face began to change. 
His head floated up from his turtleneck and started to expand, like a balloon 
being inflated. 

I uttered a silent gasp as I saw his tiny eyes poke out of his head. The eyes 
bulged bigger and bigger, until they were as big as doorknobs. 

The light from the window grew even dimmer. 

The entire room was cast in heavy shadows. The shadows swung and 
shifted. 

I couldn’t see well at all. It was like I was watching everything through a 
dark fog. 

Mr. Mortman continued to hum, even as his head bobbed and throbbed 
above his shoulders and his eyes bulged out as if on stems, poking straight up 
like insect antennae. 

And then his mouth began to twist and grow. It opened wide, like a gaping 



black hole on the enormous, bobbing head. 

Mr. Mortman sang louder now. An eerie, frightening sound, more like 
animal howling than singing. 

He pulled off the lid of the jar and let it fall to the desk. It clanged loudly as 
it hit the desktop. 

I leaned forward, struggling to see. Squinting hard, I saw Mr. Mortman dip 
his fat hand into the jar. I could hear loud buzzing from the jar. He pulled out a 
handful of flies. 

I could see his eyes bulge even wider. 

I could see the gaping black hole that was his mouth. 

He held his hand briefly over the turtle cage. I could see the flies, black dots 
all over his hand. In his palm. On his short, stubby fingers. 

I thought he was going to lower his hand to the aluminum pan. I thought he 
was going to feed the turtles. 

But, instead, he jammed the flies into his own mouth. 

I shut my eyes and held my hand over my mouth to keep from puking. 

Or screaming. 

I held my breath, but my heart kept racing. 

The shadows lurched and jumped. The darkness seemed to float around me. 

I opened my eyes. He was eating another handful of flies, shoving them 
into his gaping mouth with his fingers, swallowing them whole. 

I wanted to shout. I wanted to run. 

Mr. Mortman, I realized, was a monster. 



5 


The shadows seemed to pull away. The sky outside the window brightened, and 
a gray triangle of light fell over Mr. Mortman’s desk. 

Opening my eyes, I realized I’d been holding my breath. My chest felt as if 
it were about to burst. I let the air out slowly and took another deep breath. 

Then, without glancing again to the front of the room, I turned and ran. My 
sneakers thudded over the creaky floors, but I didn’t care. 

I had to get out of there as fast as I could. 

I bolted out the front door of the library onto the stone steps, then down the 
gravel driveway. I ran as fast as I could, my arms flying wildly at my sides, my 
black hair blowing behind me. 

I didn’t stop until I was a block away. 

Then I dropped to the curb and waited for my heart to stop pounding like a 
bass drum. 

Heavy rain clouds rolled over the sun again. 

The sky became an eerie yellow-black. A station wagon rolled past. Some 
kids in the back of it called to me, but I didn’t raise my head. 

I kept seeing the shadowy scene in the library again and again. 

Mr. Mortman is a monster. 

The words repeated nonstop in my mind. 

It can’t be, I thought, gazing up at the black clouds so low overhead. 

I was seeing things. That had to be it. 

All the shadows in the dark library. All the swirling darkness. 

It was an optical illusion. 

It was my wild imagination. 

It was a daydream, a silly fantasy. 

No! a loud voice in my head cried. 

No, Lucy, you saw Mr. Mortman’s head bulge. You saw his eyes pop out 
and grow like hideous toadstools on his ballooning face. 

You saw him reach into the fly jar. You heard him humming so happily, 
so... hungrily. 

You saw him jam the flies into his mouth. Not one handful, but two. 



And maybe he’s still in there, eating his fill. 

It was dark, Lucy. There were shadows. But you saw what you saw. You 
saw it all. 

Mr. Mortman is a monster. 

I climbed to my feet. I felt a cold drop of rain on top of my head. 

“Mr. Mortman is a monster.” I said it out loud. 

I knew I had to tell Mom and Dad as fast as I could. “The librarian is a 
monster.” That’s what I’d tell them. 

Of course, they’ll be shocked. Who wouldn’t be? 

Feeling another raindrop on my head, then one on my shoulder, I started 
jogging for home. I had gone about half a block when I stopped. 

The stupid Rollerblades! I had left them in the library again. 

I turned back. A gust of wind blew my hair over my face. I pushed it back 
with both hands. I was thinking hard, trying to figure out what to do. 

Rain pattered softly on the pavement of the street. The cold raindrops felt 
good on my hot forehead. 

I decided to go back to the library and get my skates. This time, I’d make a 
lot of noise. Make sure Mr. Mortman knew someone was there. 

If he heard me coming, I decided, he’d act normal. He wouldn’t eat flies in 
front of me. He wouldn’t let his eyes bulge and his head grow like that. 

Would he? 

I stopped as the library came back into view. I hesitated, staring through the 
drizzling rain at the old building. 

Maybe I should wait and come back tomorrow with my dad. 

Wouldn’t that be smarter? 

No. I decided I wanted my skates. And I was going to get them. 

I’ve always been pretty brave. 

The time a bat flew into our house, / was the one who yelled and screamed 
at it and chased it out with a butterfly net. 

I’m not afraid of bats. Or snakes. Or bugs. 

“Or monsters,” I said out loud. 

As I walked up to the front of the library, rain pattering softly all around 
me, I kept telling myself to make a lot of noise. Make sure Mr. Mortman knows 
you’re there, Lucy. Call out to him. Tell him you came back because you left 
your skates. 

He won’t let you see that he’s a monster if he knows you’re there. 



He won’t hurt you or anything if you give him some warning. 

I kept reassuring myself all the way up to the dark, old building. I climbed 
the stone steps hesitantly. 

Then, taking a deep breath, I grabbed the doorknob and started to go in.

I turned the knob and pushed, but the door refused to open. I tried again. It took 
me a while to realize that it was locked. 

The library was closed. 

The rain pattered softly on the grass as I walked around to the front 
window. It was high off the ground. I had to pull myself up on the window ledge 
to look inside. 

Darkness. Total darkness. 

I felt relieved and disappointed at the same time. 

I wanted my skates, but I didn’t really want to go back in there. “I’ll get 
them tomorrow,” I said out loud. 

I lowered myself to the ground. The rain was starting to come down harder, 
and the wind was picking up, blowing the rain in sheets. 

I started to run, my sneakers squishing over the wet grass. I ran all the way 
home. I was totally drenched by the time I made my way through the front door. 
My hair was matted down on my head. My T-shirt was soaked through. 

“Mom! Dad? Are you home?” I cried. 

I ran through the hallway, nearly slipping on the smooth floor, and burst 
into the kitchen. “A monster!” I cried. 

“Huh?” Randy was seated at the kitchen table, snapping a big pile of string 
beans for Mom. He was the only one who looked up. 

Mom and Dad were standing at the counter, rolling little meatballs in their 
hands. They didn’t even turn around. 

“A monster!” I screamed again. 

“Where?” Randy cried. 

“Did you get caught in the rain?” Mom asked. 

“Don’t you say hi?” Dad asked. “Do you just explode into a room yelling? 
Don’t I get a ‘Hi, Dad,’ or anything?” 

“Hi, Dad,” I cried breathlessly. “There’s a monster in the library!” 

“Lucy, please—” Mom started impatiently. 

“What kind of monster?” Randy asked. He had stopped snapping the ends 
off the beans and was staring hard at me. 

Mom finally turned around. “You’re soaked!” she cried. “You’re dripping 



all over the floor. Get upstairs and change into dry clothes.” 

Dad turned, too, a frown on his face. “Your mother just washed the floor,” 
he muttered. 

“I’m trying to tell you something!” I shouted, raising my fists in the air. 

“No need to scream,” Mom scolded. “Get changed. Then tell us.” 

“But Mr. Mortman is a monster! ” I cried. 

“Can’t you save the monster stuff till later? I just got home, and I’ve got the 
worst headache,” Dad complained. His eyes stared down at the kitchen floor. 
Small puddles were forming around me on the white linoleum. 

“I’m serious!” I insisted. “Mr. Mortman—he’s really a monster!” 

Randy laughed. “He’s funny-looking.” 

“Randy, it’s not nice to make fun of people’s looks,” Mom said crossly. She 
turned back to me. “See what you’re teaching your little brother? Can’t you set a 
good example?” 

“But, Mom!” 

“Lucy, please get into dry clothes,” Dad pleaded. “Then come down and set 
the table, okay?” 

I was so frustrated! I tilted my head back and let out an angry growl. 
“Doesn’t anyone here believe me?” I cried. 

“This really isn’t the time for your monster stories,” Mom said, turning 
back to her meatballs. “Larry, you’re making them too big,” she scolded my 
father. “They’re supposed to be small and delicate.” 

“But I like big meatballs,” Dad insisted. 

No one was paying any attention to me. I turned and stomped angrily out of 
the kitchen. 

“Is Mr. Mortman really a monster?” Randy called after me. 

“I don’t know, and I don’t care—about anything!” I screamed back. I was 
just so angry and upset. 

They didn’t have to ignore me like that. 

All they cared about was their stupid meatballs. 

Up in my room, I pulled off my wet clothes and tossed them on the floor. I 
changed into jeans and a tank top. 

Is Mr. Mortman really a monster? 

Randy’s question repeated in my head. 

Did I imagine the whole thing? Do I just have monsters on the brain? 

It had been so dark and shadowy in the library with all the lights turned off. 



Maybe Mr. Mortman didn’t eat the flies. Maybe he pulled them out of the jar and 
fed them to his pet turtles. 

Maybe I imagined that he ate them. 

Maybe his head didn’t swell up like a balloon. Maybe his eyes didn’t pop 
out. Maybe that was just a trick of the darkness, the dancing shadows, the dim 
gray light. 

Maybe I need glasses. 

Maybe I’m crazy and weird. 

“Lucy—hurry down and set the table,” my dad called up the stairs. 

“Okay. Coming.” As I made my way downstairs, I felt all mixed up. 

I didn’t mention Mr. Mortman at dinner. Actually, Mom brought him up. 
“What book did you choose to read this week?” she asked. 

“Frankenstein, ” I told her. 

Dad groaned. “More monsters!” he cried, shaking his head. “Don’t you ever 
get enough monsters? You see them wherever you go! Do you have to read 
about monsters, too?” 

Dad has a big booming voice. Everything about my dad is big. He looks 
very tough, with a broad chest and powerful-looking arms. When he shouts, the 
whole house shakes. 

“Randy, you did a great job with the string beans,” Mom said, quickly 
changing the subject. 

After dinner, I helped Dad with the dishes. Then I went upstairs to my room 
to start reading Frankenstein. I’d seen the old movie of Frankenstein on TV, so I 
knew what it was about. It was about a scientist who builds a monster, and the 
monster comes to life. 

It sounded like my kind of story. 

I wondered if it was true. 

To my surprise, I found Randy in my room, sitting on my bed, waiting for 
me. “What do you want?” I asked. I really don’t like him messing around in my 
room. 

“Tell me about Mr. Mortman,” he said. I could tell by his face that he was 
scared and excited at the same time. 

I sat down on the edge of the bed. I realized I was eager to tell someone 
about what had happened in the library. So I told Randy the whole story, starting 
with how I had to go back there because I’d left my Rollerblades. 

Randy was squeezing my pillow against his chest and breathing really hard. 



The story got him pretty scared, I guess. 

I was just finishing the part where Mr. Mortman stuffed a handful of flies 
into his mouth. Randy gasped. He looked sick. 

“Lucy!” My dad burst angrily into the room. “What is your problem ?” 

“Nothing, Dad, I—” 

“How many times do we have to tell you not to frighten Randy with your 
silly monster stories?” 

“Silly?” I shrieked. “But, Dad—this one is true!” 

He made a disgusted face and stood there glaring at me. I expected fire to 
come shooting out of his nostrils at any minute. 

“I—I’m not scared. Really!” Randy protested, coming to my defense. But 
my poor brother was as white as the pillow he was holding, and trembling all 
over. 

“This is your last warning,” Dad said. “I mean it, Lucy. I’m really angry.” 
He disappeared back downstairs. 

I stared at the doorway where he’d been standing. 

I’m really angry, too, I thought. 

I’m really angry that no one in this family believes me when I’m being 
serious. 

I knew at that moment that I had no choice. 

I had to prove that I wasn’t a liar. I had to prove that I wasn’t crazy. 

I had to prove to Mom and Dad that Mr. Mortman was a monster.

“What’s that?” I asked Aaron. 

It was a week later. I had to pass his house to get to the library for my 
Reading Rangers meeting. I stopped when I saw Aaron in the front yard. He was 
tossing a blue disc, then catching it when it snapped back at him. 

“It’s a sort of a Frisbee on a long rubber band,” he said. He tossed the disc 
and it snapped back fast. He missed it and it flew behind him, then snapped back 
again—and hit him in the back of the head. 

“That’s not how it’s supposed to work exactly,” he said, blushing. He 
started to untangle a knot in the thick rubber band. 

“Can I play with you?” I asked. 

He shook his head. “No. It’s for one person, see.” 

“It’s a one-person Frisbee?” I asked. 

“Yeah. Haven’t you seen the commercials on TV? You play it by yourself. 
You throw it and then you catch it.” 

“But what if someone wants to play with you?” I demanded. 

“You can’t,” Aaron answered. “It doesn’t work that way.” 

I thought it was pretty dumb. But Aaron seemed to be having a good time. 
So I said goodbye and continued on to the library. 

It was a beautiful, sunny day. Everything seemed bright and cheerful, 
golden and summer green. 

The library, as usual, was bathed in blue shadows. I’d only been back once 
since that day. Once very quickly, to get my Rollerblades. I stopped at the curb, 
staring up at it. I felt a sudden chill. 

The whole world seemed to grow darker here. Darker and colder. 

Just my imagination? 

We’ll see, I thought. We’ll see today what’s real and what isn’t. 

I pulled my backpack off my shoulders and, swinging it by the straps, made 
my way to the front door. Taking a deep breath, I pushed open the door and 
stepped inside. 

Perched over his desk in the main reading room, Mr. Mortman was just 
finishing with another Reading Rangers member. It was a girl I knew from 
school, Ellen Borders. 



I watched from the end of a long row of books. Mr. Mortman was saying 
good-bye. He handed her a gold star. Then he shook Ellen’s hand, and I could 
see her try not to make a disgusted face. His hand was probably sopping wet, as 
usual. 

She said something, and they both laughed. Very jolly. 

Ellen said good-bye and headed toward the doorway. I stepped out to greet 
her. “What book did you get?” I asked after we had said our hellos. 

She held it up for me. “It’s called White Fang,” she said. 

“It’s about a monster?” I guessed. 

She laughed. “No, Lucy. It’s about a dog.” 

I thought I saw Mr. Mortman’s head lift up when I said the word monster. 

But I might’ve imagined that. 

I chatted a short while longer with Ellen, who was three books ahead of me 
this summer. She had only one more to read to get her prize. What a show-off. 

I heard the front door close behind her as I took my seat next to Mr. 
Mortman’s desk and pulled Frankenstein from my bookbag. 

“Did you enjoy it?” Mr. Mortman asked. He had been studying his turtles, 
but he turned to face me, a friendly smile on his face. 

He was wearing another turtleneck, a bright yellow one this time. I noticed 
that he wore a big, purple ring on one of his pudgy pink fingers. He twirled the 
ring as he smiled at me. 

“It was kind of hard,” I said. “But I liked it.” 

I had read more than half of this one. I would have finished it if it didn’t 
have such tiny type. 

“Did you enjoy the description in this book, too?” Mr. Mortman asked, 
leaning closer to me over the desk. 

My eye caught the big jar of flies on the shelf behind him. It was very full. 

“Well, yeah,” I said. “I kind of expected more action.” 

“What was your favorite part of the book?” Mr. Mortman asked. 

“The monster!” I answered instantly. 

I watched his face to see if he reacted to that word. But he didn’t even 
blink. His tiny black eyes remained locked on mine. 

“The monster was really great,” I said. I decided to test him. “Wouldn’t it 
be neat if there were real monsters, Mr. Mortman?” 

Again he didn’t blink. “Most people wouldn’t be too happy about that,” he 
said quietly, twirling his purple ring. “Most people like to get their scares in 



books or in movies. They don’t want their scares to be in real life.” He chuckled. 

I forced myself to chuckle, too. 

I took a deep breath and continued my little test. I was trying to get him to 
make a slip, to reveal that he wasn’t really human. “Do you believe that real 
monsters exist?” I asked. 

Not very subtle. I admit it. 

But he didn’t seem to notice. 

“Do I believe that a scientist such as Dr. Frankenstein could build a living 
monster?” Mr. Mortman asked. He shook his round, bald head. “We can build 
robots, but not living creatures.” 

That wasn’t what I meant. 

Some other people came into the library. A little girl with her white-haired 
grandmother. The little girl went skipping to the children’s book section. The 
grandmother picked up a newspaper and carried it to an armchair across the 
room. 

I was very unhappy to see them. I knew that the librarian wouldn’t change 
into a monster while they were here. I was sure he only ate flies when the library 
was empty. I was going to have to hide somewhere and wait for them to leave. 

Mr. Mortman reached into his desk drawer, pulled out a gold star, and 
handed it to me. I thought he was going to shake my hand, but he didn’t. “Have 
you read Anne of Green Gables ?” he asked, picking up a book from the pile on 
his desk. 

“No,” I said. “Does it have monsters in it?” 

He threw back his head and laughed, his chins quivering. 

I thought I caught a flash of recognition in his eyes. A question. A tiny 
moment of hesitation. 

I thought my question brought something strange to his eyes. 

But, of course, again it could have been my imagination. 

“I don’t think you’ll find any monsters in this one,” he said, still chuckling. 
He stamped it with his rubber stamp and handed it to me. The cover was moist 
from where his fingers had been. 

I made an appointment for the same time next week. Then I walked out of 
the main reading room and pretended to leave the library. 

I pulled open the front door and let it slam, but I didn’t go out. Instead, I 
crept back, keeping in the shadows. I stopped at the back wall, hidden by a long 
row of bookshelves. 



Where to hide? 

I had to find a safe hiding place. Safe from Mr. Mortman’s beady eyes. And 
safe from anyone else who might enter the library. 

What was my plan? 

Well, I’d been thinking about it all week. But I really didn’t have much of a 
plan. I just wanted to catch him in the act, that’s all. 

I wanted to see clearly. I wanted to erase all doubts from my mind. 

My plan was to hide until the library was empty, to spy on Mr. Mortman, to 
watch him change into a monster and eat flies again. 

Then I’d know I wasn’t crazy. Then I’d know my eyes hadn’t been playing 
tricks on me. 

On the other side of the room, I could hear the little girl’s grandmother 
calling to Mr. Mortman. “Do you have any spelling books? Samantha only likes 
picture books. But I want her to learn to spell.” 

“Grandma, whisper!” Samantha called harshly. “This is a library, 
remember! Whisper!” 

My eyes searched the long, dark shelves for a hiding place. And there it 
was. A low bookshelf along the floor near the back was empty. It formed a 
narrow cave that I could crawl into. 

Trying to be as silent as I could, I got down on my knees, sat down on the 
shelf, turned, slid my body back, and tucked myself in. 

It wasn’t really large enough to stretch out. I had to keep my legs folded. 
My head was pressed hard against the upright board. Not very comfortable. I 
knew I couldn’t stay like this forever. 

But it was late afternoon. Maybe Samantha and her grandmother would 
leave soon. Maybe I wouldn’t have to stay tucked on the shelf like a moldy old 
book for very long. 

My heart was pounding. I could hear Mr. Mortman talking softly to 
Samantha. I could hear the rustle of the old lady’s newspaper. I could hear the 
tick-tick-tick of the big wall clock on the front wall. 

I could hear every sound, every creak and groan. 

I suddenly had to sneeze. My nose tickled like crazy! There was so much 
dust down here. 

I reached up and squeezed my nose hard between my thumb and forefinger. 
Somehow I managed to shut off the sneeze. 

My heart was pounding even harder. I could hear it over the tick-tick-tick of 



the clock. 

Please leave, I thought, wishing Samantha and her grandmother out of 
there. 

Please leave. Please leave. Please leave. 

I don’t know how long I can stay tucked on this dusty shelf. 

My neck was already starting to hurt from being pressed against the shelf. 
And I felt another sneeze coming on. 

“This book is too hard. I need an easier one,” Samantha was saying to Mr. 
Mortman. 

I heard Mr. Mortman mutter something. I heard shuffling feet. Footsteps. 

Were they coming this way? 

Were they going to see me? 

No. They turned and headed back to the children’s section on the side. 

“I’ve already read this one,” I heard Samantha complain. 

Please leave. Please leave. Please leave. 

It must have been only a few minutes later when Samantha and her 
grandmother left, but it seemed like hours to me. 

My neck was stiff. My back ached. My legs were tingling, both asleep. 

I heard the front door close behind them. 

The library was empty now. Except for Mr. Mortman and me. 

I waited. And listened. 

I heard the scrape of his tall stool against the floor. Then I heard his 
footsteps. He coughed. 

It suddenly grew darker. He was turning off the lights. 

It’s show time! I thought. 

He’s closing up. Now’s the time. Now’s the time he’ll turn into a monster 
before my eyes. 

I rolled silently off the shelf, onto the floor. Then I pulled myself to a 
standing position. Holding onto a higher shelf, I raised one leg, then the other, 
trying to get the circulation back. 

As the overhead lights went out, most of the library was blanketed in 
darkness. The only light came from the late afternoon sunlight flooding through 
the window at the front of the room. 

Where was Mr. Mortman? 

I heard him cough again. Then he began to hum to himself. 

He was closing up. 



Holding my breath, I tiptoed closer to his desk. I leaned my side against the 
shelves as I moved, keeping in the shadows. 

Whoa. 

I suddenly realized Mr. Mortman wasn’t at his desk. 

I heard his footsteps behind me, at the back of the main reading room. Then 
I heard his shoes thud across the floor of the front entryway. 

I froze in place, listening hard, still holding my breath. 

Was he leaving? 

No. 

I heard a loud click. 

The sound of a lock being turned. 

He had locked the front door! 

I hadn’t planned on that. No way. That was definitely not part of my plan. 
Frozen in the dark aisle, I realized that I was locked in with him! 

Now what? 



8 


Maybe my plan wasn’t exactly the best plan in the world. 

Maybe the whole idea was stupid. 

You can bet I had plenty of doubts racing through my mind as I heard Mr. 
Mortman return to the main reading room. 

My plan, of course, was to prove to myself that I was right, that he was a 
monster. And then—to run out of the library! 

The plan wasn’t to be locked in that dark, creepy building with him, unable 
to escape. 

But here I was. 

So far, I was okay. He had no idea that anyone else was here with him. No 
idea that he was being spied on. 

Pressed against the tall shelves, I crept along the narrow aisle until I was as 
close as I dared to go. I could see his entire desk, caught in a deep orange 
rectangle of light from the high window. 

Mr. Mortman stepped behind his desk, humming softly to himself. He 
straightened a stack of books, then shoved it to a corner of the desk. 

He pulled open his desk drawer and shuffled things around, searching for 
something in there. 

I crept a little closer. I could see very clearly now. The afternoon sunlight 
made everything orangey-red. 

Mr. Mortman tugged at the neck of his turtle-neck. He rolled some pencils 
off the desktop into the open desk drawer. Then he shut the drawer. 

This is boring, I thought. 

This is very boring. And normal. 

I must have been wrong last week. I must have imagined the whole thing. 

Mr. Mortman is just a funny little man. He isn’t a monster at all. 

I sank against the tall shelf, disappointed. 

I’d wasted all this time, hiding on that filthy shelf—for nothing. 

And now here I was, locked in the library after closing time, watching the 
librarian clean off his desk. 

What a thrill! 



I’ve got to get out of here, I thought. I’ve been really stupid. 

But then I saw Mr. Mortman reach for the fly jar on the shelf behind him. 

I swallowed hard. My heart gave a sudden lurch. 

A smile crossed Mr. Mortman’s pudgy face as he set the big glass jar down 
in front of him. Then he reached across the desk and, with both hands, pulled the 
rectangular turtle pan closer. 

“Dinnertime, my timid friends,” he said in his high, scratchy voice. He 
grinned down at the turtles. He reached into the pan and splashed the water a bit. 
“Dinnertime, friends,” he repeated. 

And, then, as I stared without blinking, stared with my jaw dropping lower 
and lower in disbelief, his face began to change again. 

His round head began to swell up. 

His black eyes bulged. 

His mouth grew until it became an open black pit. 

The enormous head bobbed above the yellow turtleneck. The eyes swam in 
front of the head. The mouth twisted, opening and closing like an enormous fish 
mouth. 

I was right! I realized. 

Mr. Mortman is a monster! 

I knew I was right! But no one would believe me. 

TheyTl have to believe me now, I told myself. I’m seeing this so clearly. It’s 
all so bright in the red-orange light. 

I’m seeing it. I’m not imagining it. 

TheyTl have to believe me now. 

And as I gaped openmouthed at the gross creature the librarian had become, 
he reached into the fly jar, removed a handful of flies, and shoved them hungrily 
into his mouth. 

“Dinnertime,” he rasped, talking as he chewed. 

I could hear the buzz of the flies inside the jar. 

They were alive ! The flies were alive, and he was gobbling them up as if 
they were candy. 

I raised my hands and pressed them against the sides of my face as I stared. 

“Dinnertime!” 

Another handful of flies. 

Some of them had escaped. They buzzed loudly around his swollen, 
bobbing head. 



As he chewed and swallowed, Mr. Mortman grabbed at the flies in the air, 
his tiny hands surprisingly quick. He pulled flies out of the air—one, another, 
another—and popped them into his enormous gorge of a mouth. 

Mr. Mortman’s eyes swam out in front of his face. 

For a short, terrifying moment, the eyes stopped. They were staring right at 

me! 

I realized I had leaned too far into the aisle. 

Had he spotted me? 

I jumped back with a gasp of panic. 

The bulging black eyes, like undulating toadstools, remained in place for 
another second or two. Then they continued rolling and swimming about. 

After a third handful of flies, Mr. Mortman closed the jar, licking his black 
lips with a snakelike, pencil-thin tongue. 

The buzzing stopped. 

The room was silent again except for the ticking clock and my thundering 
heartbeats. 

Now what? I thought. 

Is that it? 

No. 

“Dinnertime, my timid friends,” the librarian said in a thin, trembling voice, 
the voice seeming to bob along with the enormous head. 

He reached a hand into the pan and picked up one of the little green-shelled 
turtles. I could see the turtle’s legs racing. 

Is he going to feed some flies to the turtles now? I wondered. 

Mr. Mortman held the turtle higher, studying it with his bulging, rolling 
eyes. He held it up to the sunlight. The turtle’s legs continued to move. 

Then he popped the turtle into his mouth. 

I heard the crack of the shell as Mr. Mortman bit down. 

He chewed noisily, several times, making a loud crunch with each chew. 
Then I saw him swallow once, twice, till he got it down. 

I’d seen enough. 

More than enough. 

I turned away. I began to make my way blindly back through the dark aisle. 
I jogged quickly. I didn’t really care if he heard me or not. 

I just had to get out of there. 

Out into the sunlight and fresh air. 



Away from the crunching sound that kept repeating in my ears. The crunch 
of the turtle shell as Mr. Mortman chewed it and chewed it. 

Chewed it alive. 

I ran from the main reading room, my heart thudding, my legs feeling 
heavy as stone. 

I was gasping for breath when I reached the front entry. I ran to the door 
and grabbed the handle. 

And then remembered. 

The door was locked. 

I couldn’t get out. 

I was locked in. 

And, then, as I stood staring straight ahead at the closed door, my hand 
gripping the brass knob, I heard footsteps. Behind me. Rapid footsteps. 

Mr. Mortman had heard me. 

I was trapped. 



9 


I froze in panic, staring at the door until it became a dark blur in front of me. 

Mr. Mortman’s footsteps grew louder behind me. 

Help! I uttered a silent plea. Somebody —help me! 

The librarian would burst into the front entry-way any second. And there 
I’d be. Trapped at the door. 

Trapped like a rat. Or like a turtle! 

And then what? 

Would he grab me up like one of his pets? 

Would he crunch me between his teeth? 

There had to be a way out of there. There had to be! 

And, then, staring at the blur of the door, it suddenly came clear to me. It all 
came back in focus. And I realized that maybe—just maybe—I wasn’t trapped at 
all. 

Mr. Mortman had locked the door from the inside. 

The inside. 

That meant that maybe I could unlock it and open the door. 

If the door locked with a key, then I was stuck. 

But if it was just an ordinary lock that you turned... 

“Hey, is someone out there?” Mr. Mortman’s raspy voice burst into my 
thoughts. 

My eyes frantically searched the door. I found the lock under the brass 
knob. 

I reached for it. 

Please turn. Please turn. Please turn. 

The lock turned in my hand with a soft click. The prettiest sound I ever 
heard! 

In a second, I had pulled open the door. In another second, I was out on the 
stone steps. Then, I was running as fast as I could, running across the front lawn, 
cutting through some shrubs, diving through a hedge—running for my life! 

Gasping for air, I turned halfway down the block. I could see Mr. Mortman, 
a shadowy figure in the library door. He was standing in the doorway, staring 



out, not moving. Just standing there. 

Had he seen me? 

Did he know it was me spying on him? 

I didn’t want to know. I just wanted to get away. 

The late afternoon sun was ducking behind the trees, making the shadows 
long and dark. I lowered my head and ran into the long, blue shadows, my 
sneakers thudding hard against the sidewalk. 

I was out. I was okay. I had seen the monster, but he hadn’t seen me. I 
hoped. 

I ran until I got to Aaron’s house. He was still in the front yard. He was 
sitting on the stump of an old tree his parents had removed. I could see the blue 
Frisbee-type thing in his lap. He was struggling to untangle the long rubber 
band. 

Aaron had his head down, concentrating on undoing the knots, and didn’t 
see me at first. 

“Aaron—Mr. Mortman is a monster!” I cried breathlessly. 

“Huh?” He looked up, startled. 

“Mr. Mortman—he’s a monster!” I repeated, panting like a dog. I put my 
hands on my knees and leaned forward, trying to catch my breath. 

“Lucy, what’s your problem?” Aaron muttered, returning his attention to the 
mbber band. 

“Listen to me!” I screamed impatiently. I didn’t sound like myself. I didn’t 
recognize my shrill, panicky voice. 

“This thing stinks,” Aaron muttered. “It’s totally tangled.” 

“Aaron, please !” I pleaded. “I was in the library. I saw him. He changed 
into a monster. He ate one of his turtles! ” 

Aaron laughed. “Yum!” he said. “Did you bring me one?” 

“Aaron, it isn’t funny!” I cried, still out of breath. “I—I was so scared. He’s 
a monster. He really is. I thought I was locked in with him. I thought—” 

“Tell you what,” Aaron said, still picking at the knots in the rubber band. 
He held the blue plastic disc up to me. “If you can untangle this big knot, I’ll let 
you play with it.” 

“Aaaaaagh!” I let out an angry scream. “Why don’t you listen to me?” 

“Lucy, give me a break,” Aaron said, still holding the disc up to me. “I 
don’t want to talk about monsters now. It’s kind of babyish, you know?” 

“But, Aaron!” 



“Why don’t you save that stuff for Randy?” Aaron suggested. He waved the 
blue disc. “Do you want to help me with this or not?” 

“Not!” I screamed. Then I added: “You’re a lousy friend!” 

He looked a little surprised. 

I didn’t wait for him to say anything else. I took off again, heading for 
home. 

I was really angry. What was his problem, anyway? You’re supposed to 
take a friend seriously. You’re not supposed to think automatically that your 
friend is just making up a story. 

Couldn’t Aaron see how frightened and upset I was? Couldn’t he see that it 
wasn’t a joke? 

He’s a total jerk, I decided, as my house finally came into view. I’m never 
speaking to him again. 

I ran up the driveway, pulled open the screen door, and burst into the house. 
“Mom! Dad!” My heart was pounding so hard, my mouth was so dry, my cry 
was a hoarse whisper. 

“Mom—where are you?” 

I ran through the house until I found Randy in the den. He was lying on the 
floor, his face two inches in front of the TV, watching a Bugs Bunny cartoon. 

“Where are Mom and Dad?” I cried breathlessly. 

He ignored me. Just stared at his cartoon. The colors from the TV danced 
over his face. 

“Randy—where are they?” I repeated frantically. 

“Grocery shopping,” he muttered without turning around. 

“But I have to talk to them!” I said. “When did they leave? When will they 
be back?” 

He shrugged without removing his eyes from the screen. “I don’t know.” 

“But, Randy!” 

“Leave me alone,” he whined. “I’m watching a cartoon.” 

“But I saw a monster!” I screamed. “Areal one!” 

His eyes went wide. His mouth dropped open. “A real monster?” he 
stammered. 

“Yes!” I cried. 

“Did he follow you home?” Randy asked, turning pale. 

“I hope not!” I exclaimed. I wheeled around and ran out of the den. I 
glanced out the living room window as I hurried past. No sign of my parents’ car. 



So I ran up to my room. 

I was so upset. So angry and upset. 

I took two steps into my room, then stopped. 

There in my bed, under the covers, lay a big, hairy monster, its gnarled 
brown head on my pillow, its gaping, toothless mouth twisted in an evil grin. 



10 


I grabbed the top of my dresser and uttered a loud gasp of shock. 

The monster stared at me, one round eye bigger than the other. It didn’t 
move off my pillow. 

It uttered a high-pitched giggle. 

I mean, I thought it giggled. It took me a short while to realize that the 
giggling was coming from behind me. 

I spun around to see Randy just outside the door. When he saw the terrified 
look on my face, his giggle became a roar of laughter. 

“Like it?” he asked, stepping past me into the room and walking up to my 
bed. “I made it in art class.” 

“Huh?” 

Randy picked up the lumpy brown monster head. As soon as he picked it 
up, I saw that the hair was brown yarn, that the face was painted on. 

“It’s papier-mache,” Randy announced proudly. “Neat, huh?” 

I let out a long sigh and slumped onto the edge of the bed. “Yeah. Neat,” I 
muttered unhappily. 

“I put the pillows under your covers to make it look like he had a body,” 
Randy continued, grinning. His grin looked a lot like the grin on the monster 
head. 

“Very clever,” I said bitterly. “Listen, Randy, I just had a really scary thing 
happen. And I’m really not in the mood for jokes.” 

His grin grew wider. He tossed the brown monster head at me. 

I caught it and held it in my lap. He motioned for me to toss it back, but I 
didn’t. 

“Didn’t you hear me?” I cried. “I’m very upset. I saw a monster. A real one. 
In the library.” 

“You’re just embarrassed because my monster head fooled you,” Randy 
said. “You’re mad because I really scared you.” 

“Mr. Mortman is a monster,” I told him, bouncing the monster head in my 
lap. “I saw him change into a monster. His head grew big, and his eyes popped 
out, and his mouth twisted open.” 

“Stop it!” Randy cried, starting to look scared. 



“I saw him eat flies,” I continued. “Handfuls of flies.” 

“Flies?” Randy asked. “Yuck!” 

“And then I saw him pick up one of his pet turtles. You know. The ones he 
keeps in that pan on his desk. I saw him pop it in his mouth and eat it.” 

Randy shuddered. He stared at me thoughtfully. For a moment, I thought 
maybe he believed me. But then his expression changed, and he shook his head. 

“No way, Lucy. You’re just mad because I scared you for once. So now 
you’re trying to scare me. But it isn’t going to work.” 

Randy grabbed the monster head from my lap and started out the door. “I 
don’t believe you about Mr. Mortman.” 

“But it’s true!” I protested shrilly. 

“I’m missing my cartoons,” he said. 

Just then, I heard a knock at the front door. 

“Mom!” I cried. I leapt off the bed and went tearing to the stairs. I shoved 
Randy out of my way, and practically flew down the steps, taking them three at a 
time. 

“Mom! Dad—you’re home! I have to tell you—” 

I froze in front of the screen door. 

It wasn’t my parents. 

It was Mr. Mortman. 



11 


My first thought was to run. 

My next thought was to slam the front door. 

My next thought was to run back upstairs and hide in my room. 

But it was too late to hide. Mr. Mortman had already seen me. He was 
staring at me through the screen door with those beady black eyes, an evil, thin¬ 
lipped smile on his pale, round face. 

He saw me, I realized. 

He saw me spying on him in the library. 

He saw me running away. 

He knows that I know his secret. He knows that I know he’s a monster. 

And he’s come to get me. 

He’s come to get rid of me, to make sure his secret is safe. 

“Lucy?” he called. 

I stared at him through the screen. 

I could see in his eyes that he knew it had been me in the library. 

The sun had nearly gone down. The sky behind him was sunset-purple. His 
face looked even paler than usual in the evening light. 

“Lucy, hi. It’s me,” he said. 

He was waiting for me to say something. But I was frozen there in panic, 
trying to decide whether to run or scream. Or both. 

Randy had stopped halfway down the stairs. “Who is it?” he asked. 

“It’s Mr. Mortman,” I replied softly. 

“Oh.” That was what my little brother said. He came the rest of the way 
down, then walked past me on his way back to the den. 

“Hi, Mr. Mortman,” I managed to say, not moving any closer to the door. 
Then I blurted out, “My parents aren’t home.” 

I knew instantly that it was a dumb thing to say. 

Now the monster knew that Randy and I were here alone. 

Why did I say that? I asked myself. How could I be so stupid? 

“I didn’t come to see your parents,” Mr. Mortman said softly. “I came to see 
you, Lucy.” 



He knows! I thought. He really knows! 

I’m dead meat! 

I swallowed hard. I didn’t know what to say. My eyes searched the front 
hallway for a weapon, something to hit him with when he broke through the 
screen door and came after me. 

Mr. Mortman’s eyes narrowed. His smile faded. 

This is it! I thought. 

There was nothing around that I could use to fight him off. A little glass 
flower vase. That’s all I could see. I didn’t think it would be too effective against 
a roaring monster. 

“Lucy, I believe this belongs to you,” Mr. Mortman said. He held up my 
blue canvas backpack. 

“Huh?” 

“I found it back in the stacks,” Mr. Mortman said, his smile returning. “I 
didn’t know who had left it. But I found your name and address on the tag here.” 

“You—you mean—?” I stammered. 

“I always walk home after I close the library, so I thought I’d bring it to 
you,” he said. 

Was this a trap? 

I studied his face warily. I couldn’t tell what he was thinking. 

I had no choice. I pushed open the screen door, and he handed me the 
backpack. “Wow. Thanks,” I said. “That was really nice of you.” 

He straightened the sleeves of his yellow turtleneck. “Well, I figured you’d 
probably want to get started on Anne of Green Gables tonight,” he said. 

“Yeah. Sure,” I replied uncertainly. 

“I guess you ran out of the library pretty quickly,” Mr. Mortman said, 
staring into my eyes. 

“Uh... yeah. I had to get home,” I told him, glancing back to the den. The 
cartoon music floated into the hallway. 

“So you didn’t wait around or anything after our appointment?” he asked. 

Does he know ? I wonder. 

Or is he just trying to find out if it was me or not? 

“No,” I said, trying to keep my voice from shaking. “I ran right out. I was in 
a hurry. I—I guess that’s why I forgot my bag.” 

“Oh, I see,” Mr. Mortman replied thoughtfully, rubbing his chins. 

“Why?” I blurted out. 



The question seemed to surprise him. “Oh, it’s nothing, really,” he said. “I 
think someone was playing a trick on me. Staying in the library after closing.” 

“Really?” I asked, opening my eyes wide and trying to sound as innocent as 
possible. “Why would they do that?” 

“To scare me,” Mr. Mortman answered, chuckling. “Some kids don’t have 
anything better to do than try to scare the kindly old librarian.” 

But you’re not a kindly old librarian, I thought. You’re a monster! 

“I got up to look around,” Mr. Mortman continued, “and whoever it was 
high-tailed it.” He chuckled again. 

“I wouldn’t want to be locked in there overnight,” I said, studying his face, 
hoping my innocent act was working. 

“Neither would I!” he exclaimed. “It’s a pretty creepy old building! 
Sometimes I get so scared from all the strange creaks and groans.” 

Yeah. Sure! I thought sarcastically. 

Behind him, I saw my parents’ car turn into the driveway. I breathed a silent 
sigh of relief. Thank goodness they were finally home! 

“Guess I’ll say good night,” Mr. Mortman said pleasantly. He turned and 
watched as my parents rolled past him up the driveway, heading to the back of 
the house. 

“Thanks for bringing the bag,” I said, eager to go greet Mom and Dad. 

“No problem. See you next week.” He hurried away. 

I went running to the kitchen. Mom was just coming in through the kitchen 
door, carrying a brown grocery bag. “Wasn’t that Mr. Mortman at the front 
door?” she asked, surprised. 

“Yeah,” I answered eagerly. “I’m so glad to see you, Mom. I have to tell 
you—” 

“What did he want?” Mom interrupted. 

“He... uh... returned my backpack. I left it at the library, see. I have to tell 
you about him, Mom. He—” 

“That was really nice of him,” Mom said, setting the grocery bag down on 
the counter. “How come you forgot it, Lucy?” 

“I ran out of there really fast, Mom. You see—” 

“Well, that was really nice of Mr. Mortman,” she interrupted again. She 
started to remove things from the grocery bag. “He doesn’t live in this direction. 
I think he lives way over on the north side.” 

“Mom, I’m trying to tell you something!” I cried impatiently. My hands 



were balled into tight fists. My heart was pounding. “Mr. Mortman is a 
monster!” 

“Huh?” She turned away from the counter and stared at me. 

“He’s a monster, Mom! Areal one!” I cried. 

“Lucy, Lucy.” She shook her head. “You see monsters everywhere.” 

“Mom!” 

“Stop it, Lucy. Stop being dumb. I hope you were polite to Mr. Mortman.” 
“Mo-om!” 

“Enough. Go outside and help your father bring in the rest of the groceries.” 



12 


So, once again my wonderful parents refused to believe me. 

I tried to describe what I had seen from my hiding place in the library. But 
Mom just shook her head. Dad said I had a great imagination. Even Randy 
refused to be scared. He told Mom and Dad how he had scared me with his 
stupid papier-mache monster head. 

I practically begged them to believe me. 

But Mom said I was just lazy. She said I was making up the story about Mr. 
Mortman so I could get out of the Reading Rangers program and wouldn’t have 
to read any more books this summer. 

When she said that, I got really insulted, of course. I yelled something back. 
And it ended up with all of us growling and snapping at each other, followed by 
me storming up to my room. 

Slumped unhappily on my bed, I thought hard about my predicament. 

I could see that they were never going to believe me. 

I had told too many monster stories, played too many monster jokes. 

So, I realized, I needed someone else to tell my parents about Mr. Mortman. 
I needed someone else to see Mr. Mortman become a monster. I needed someone 
else to believe the truth with me. 

Aaron. 

If Aaron came along with me and hid in the library and saw Mr. Mortman 
eat flies and turtles with his bulging head—then Aaron could tell my parents. 

And they’d believe Aaron. 

They had no reason not to believe Aaron. He was a serious, no-nonsense 
guy. My most serious, no-nonsense friend. 

Aaron was definitely the answer to my problem. 

Aaron would finally make my parents realize the truth about Mr. Mortman. 

I called him immediately. 

I told him I needed him to come hide in the library and spy on Mr. 
Mortman. 

“When?” he asked. “At your next Reading Rangers meeting?” 

“No. I can’t wait a whole week,” I said, whispering into the phone, even 
though my parents were downstairs and there was no one around. “How about 



tomorrow afternoon? Just before closing time. Around five.” 

“It’s too dumb,” Aaron insisted. “I don’t think I want to.” 

“HI pay you!” I blurted out. 

“How much?” he asked. 

What a friend! 

“Five dollars,” I said reluctantly. I never save much of my allowance. I 
wondered if I still had five dollars in my drawer. 

“Well, okay,” Aaron agreed. “Five dollars. In advance.” 

“And you’ll hide with me and then tell my parents everything you see?” I 
asked. 

“Yeah. Okay. But I still think it’s dumb.” He was silent for a moment. “And 
what if we get caught?” he asked after a while. 

“We’ll be careful,” I said, feeling a little chill of fear. 



13 


I spent most of the next day hanging around, teasing Randy. I couldn’t wait for 
the afternoon to roll around. 

I was so excited. And nervous. 

I had it all worked out. Aaron and I would sneak into the main reading 
room without Mr. Mortman knowing anyone had come in. We’d hide in the dark 
shelves, just as I had done. 

Then, when the librarian turned off the lights and closed up the library, 
we’d sneak up the aisle, keeping in the shadows, and watch him become a 
monster. 

Then we wouldn’t run out the way I had done. That was far too risky. We 
would go back to our hiding places in the low shelves and wait for Mr. Mortman 
to leave. Once he was gone, Aaron and I would let ourselves out of the library 
and hurry to my house to tell my parents what we had seen. 

Easy. Nothing to it, I kept telling myself. 

But I was so nervous, so eager to get it over with, I arrived at Aaron’s house 
an hour early. I rang the bell. 

No answer. 

I rang it again. 

Finally, after a long wait, Aaron’s teenage brother, Burt, pulled open the 
door. He had on blue denim shorts and no shirt. “Hi,” he said, scratching his 
chest. “You looking for Aaron?” 

“Yeah.” I nodded. 

“He isn’t home.” 

“Huh?” I practically fell off the porch. “Where is he? I mean, when will he 
be back?” 

“Don’t know. He went to the dentist,” Burt said, gazing past me to the 
street. 

“He did?” 

“Yeah. He had an appointment. With the orthodontist. He’s getting braces. 
Didn’t he tell you?” 

“No,” I said glumly. I could feel my heart sink to my knees. “I was 
supposed to meet him.” 



“Guess he forgot,” Burt said with a shrug. “You know Aaron. He never 
remembers stuff like that.” 

“Well. Thanks,” I muttered unhappily. I said good-bye and trudged back 
down to the sidewalk. 

That dirty traitor. 

I felt really betrayed. 

I had waited all day. I was so psyched for spying on Mr. Mortman. 

I had counted on Aaron. And all the while, he had a stupid orthodontist 
appointment. 

“I hope your braces really hurt!” I shouted out loud. 

I kicked a small rock across the sidewalk. I felt like kicking a lot of rocks. I 
felt like kicking Aaron. 

I turned and headed home, thinking all kinds of ugly thoughts. I was at the 
bottom of my driveway when an idea popped into my head. 

I didn’t need Aaron, I suddenly realized. 

I had a camera. 

My parents had given me a really good camera last Christmas. 

If I sneaked into the library with the camera and took a few snapshots of 
Mr. Mortman after he became a monster, the photos would be all the proof I 
needed. 

My parents would have to believe actual color snapshots. 

Forgetting my disappointment about Aaron, I hurried up to my room and 
pulled the camera off the shelf. It already had film in it. I had taken a bunch of 
shots at Randy’s birthday party just before school let out. 

I examined it carefully. There were still eight or nine shots left on the roll. 

That should be plenty to capture Mr. Mortman at his ugliest. 

I glanced at the clock on my desk. It was still early. A little after four-thirty. 
I had half an hour before the library closed. 

“This has got to work,” I said out loud, crossing my fingers on both hands. 

Then I strapped the camera around my neck and headed to the library. 

I entered the library silently and crept to the doorway of the main reading room. 
My plan was to sneak into the low shelf where I had hidden before. But I quickly 
saw that it wasn’t going to be as easy as I thought. 

The library was very crowded. There were several kids in the children’s 
book section. There were people thumbing through the magazines. One of the 



microfiche machines was being used against one wall. And several aisles, 
including the one with my special hiding place, had people in them, browsing 
and searching the shelves. 

I’ll just have to wait them out, I decided, turning and pretending to search 
one of the back shelves. 

I could see Mr. Mortman standing behind his desk. He was checking out a 
stack of books for a young woman, opening the covers, stamping the card, then 
slamming the covers shut. 

It was nearly five o’clock. Just about closing time. 

I crept along the back wall, searching for another hiding spot. Near the 
corner, I spotted a large wooden cabinet. I recognized it as I stepped behind it 
and lowered myself from view. It was the long, tall cabinet that held the card 
catalogue. 

It will hide me quite nicely, I thought. 

I hunched down behind the old cabinet and waited. Time dragged by. Every 
second seemed like an hour. 

At five-fifteen, Mr. Mortman was still checking out books for people. He 
announced closing time, but some of the magazine readers seemed very reluctant 
to leave. 

I felt myself getting more and more nervous. My hands were ice cold. The 
camera suddenly seemed to weigh a thousand pounds, like a dead weight around 
my neck. I removed it and dropped it to my lap. 

It will all be worth it, I kept repeating to myself. 

It will all be worth it if I get a good, clear shot of the monster. 

I leaned against the back of the cabinet and waited, my hand gripping the 
camera in my lap. 

Finally, the room emptied out. 

I climbed to my knees, suddenly very alert, as I heard the librarian go to 
lock the front door. A few seconds later, I heard him return to his desk. 

I stood up and peered around the side of the cabinet. He was busily 
shuffling papers, straightening his desk for the night. 

In a few minutes, I hoped, it would be feeding time. 

Monster time. 

Taking a deep breath, I gripped the camera tightly in one hand and, feeling 
my heart start to pound, began to make my way silently toward Mr. Mortman’s 
desk at the front of the room. 



14 


Everything seemed to be taking so long today. 

Was time really in slow motion? Or did everything seem so slow because 
my pulse was racing so fast? 

I was so eager to get my proof—and get out of there! 

But Mr. Mortman was taking his good old time. He shuffled through a stack 
of papers, reading some of them, folding some of them in half, and tossing them 
in the wire trash basket beside his desk. 

He hummed to himself as he read through the entire stack. Finally, he got to 
the bottom of the pile and tossed the final sheet away. 

Now! I thought. Now you’ll start your monster routine, won’t you, Mr. 
Mortman! 

But no. 

He lifted a stack of books from his desk and carried them to the shelves. 
Humming loudly, he began returning the books to their places. 

I pressed myself into the shadows, hoping he wouldn’t come to my row. I 
was near the far wall in front of the row of microfiche machines. 

Please, let’s get on with it! I begged silently. 

But when he finished with the first stack, Mr. Mortman returned to his desk 
and hoisted up another pile of books to replace. 

I’m going to be late for dinner, I realized with a growing sense of dread. My 
parents are going to kill me! 

The thought made me chuckle. Here I was, locked inside this creepy old 
library with a monster, and I was worried about getting scolded for being late for 
dinner! 

I could hear Mr. Mortman, but I couldn’t see him. He was somewhere 
among the rows of shelves, replacing books. 

Suddenly his humming grew louder. 

I realized he was in the next aisle. I could see him over the tops of the 
books on the shelf to my right. 

And that meant he could see me! 

Gripped with panic, I ducked and dropped to the floor. 

Had he heard me? Had he seen me? 



I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. 

He continued to hum to himself. The sound grew fainter as he moved in the 
other direction. 

Letting out a silent sigh of relief, I climbed back to my feet. Gripping the 
camera tightly in my right hand, I peered around the side of the shelf. 

I heard his shoes shuffling along the floor. He reappeared, his bald head 
shiny in the late afternoon sunlight from the window, and made his way slowly 
to his desk. 

The clock on the wall ticked noisily. 

My hand gripping the camera was cold and clammy. 

Watching him shuffle things around inside his desk drawer, I suddenly lost 
my nerve. 

This is stupid, I thought. A really bad idea. 

I’m going to be caught. 

As soon as I step out to snap the picture, he’ll see me. 

He’ll chase after me. He won’t let me get out of the library with this 
camera. 

He won’t let me get out of here alive. 

Turn and run! a voice inside my head commanded. 

Quick, while you have the chance—turn and run! 

Then another voice interrupted that one. He isn’t going to turn into a 
monster tonight, Lucy, the voice said. You’re wasting your time. You’re getting 
yourself all nervous and scared for no reason. 

My mind was spinning, whirring with voices and frightening thoughts. I 
leaned hard against the wooden shelf, steadying myself. I closed my eyes for a 
moment, trying to clear my head. 

How many shots can you take? a voice in my head asked. Can you shoot off 
three or four before he realizes what is happening? 

You only need one good shot, another voice told me. One good clear shot 
will be the proof you need. 

You’d better hope he’s humming very loudly, another voice said. Otherwise, 
he’ll hear your camera shutter click. 

Turn and run! another voice repeated. Turn and run! 

You only need one good shot. 

Don’t let him hear your shutter click. 

I stepped forward and peered around the shelf. 



Mr. Mortman, humming happily away, was reaching for the fly jar. 

Yes! I cried silently. Finally! 

“Dinnertime, my timid friends,” I heard him say in a pleasant singsong. 
And as he started to unscrew the jar lid, his head began to grow. 

His eyes bulged. His mouth twisted open and enlarged. 

In a few seconds, his monstrous head was bobbing above his shirt. His 
snakelike tongue flicked out of his black mouth as he removed the jar lid and 
pulled out a handful of flies. 

“Dinnertime, my timid friends!” 

Picture time! I thought, gathering my courage. 

I raised the camera to my eye with a trembling hand. I gripped it tightly 
with both hands to keep it from shaking. 

Then, holding my breath, I leaned as far forward as I could. 

Mr. Mortman was downing his first handful of flies, chewing noisily, 
humming as he chewed. 

I struggled to center him in the viewfinder. 

I was so nervous, the camera was shaking all over the place! 

I’m so glad he’s humming, I thought, raising my finger to the shutter 
button. 

He won’t hear the camera click. 

I’ll be able to take more than one shot. 

Okay. Okay... 

He was still enjoying his first batch of tender flies. 

Now! I told myself. 

I was about to push the button—when Mr. Mortman suddenly turned away. 

With a gasp, I stopped myself just in time. 

My pulse was pounding at my temples so hard, I could barely see straight. 

What was he doing? 

He was reaching for another jar. He set it down on his desk and unscrewed 
the lid. 

I raised the camera again and squinted at him through the viewfinder. 

What did he have in this jar? Something was fluttering in there. It took me a 
while to realize they were moths. White moths. 

He closed his fist around one and shoved it hungrily into his mouth. 
Another moth fluttered out of the jar before he could close the lid. 

Mr. Mortman’s eyes bulged like toadstools growing out of his balloonlike 



head. His mouth twisted and coiled as he chewed the moth. 

Taking another deep breath and holding it, I leaned forward as far as I 
could, steadied the camera in front of my eye—and snapped the shutter. 



15 


The FLASH! 

I had forgotten about the flash! 

I was so worried about the click of the shutter, I had totally forgotten that 
my camera had automatic flash! 

The instant flash of white light made Mr. Mortman cry out angrily. Startled, 
he raised his hands to cover his bulging eyes. 

I stood frozen in the aisle, frozen by carelessness, frozen by my stupidity! 

“Who’s there?” he growled, still covering his eyes. 

I realized he hadn’t seen me yet. Those big eyes must have been very 
sensitive to light. The flash had momentarily blinded him. 

He let out a monstrous roar that echoed off the four walls of the vast room. 

Somehow I revived my senses enough to pull myself back, out of view. 

“Who’s there?” he repeated, his voice a rasping snarl. “You won’t get 
away!” 

I saw him lumbering in my direction. As he lurched toward me, his body 
swayed awkwardly, as if his eyes were still blinded. 

I gaped in horror as he approached. 

He seemed steadier with each step. His bulging eyes searched the rows of 
shelves. He was breathing hard, each breath a furious growl. 

“Who’s there? Who’s there?” 

Get going! I told myself, still gripping the camera in both hands. Get going! 
What are you waiting for? 

“You won’t get away!” the monster cried. 

Oh, yes, I will! 

He was three rows away, his eyes peering down the dark aisles. Searching. 
Searching. 

He hadn’t seen me, I knew. The light of the flash had startled him, then 
blinded him. 

He didn’t know it was me. 

Now all I had to do was run. All I had to do was get out of there with the 
proof safely in my hands. 



So what was I waiting for? 

He lumbered closer. He was only a row away. 

Run! I ordered my paralyzed legs. Run! Don’t just stand there! 

I spun around, clumsily bumped into a shelf of books. Several books 
toppled to the floor. 

Run! Don’t stop! 

It was taking me so long to move. I was so weighed down by my fear. 

Run! Lucy! He’s right behind you! 

Finally, my legs started to cooperate. 

Holding the camera in one hand, I began to run through the dark aisle 
toward the back of the room. 

“You won’t get away!” the monster bellowed from the next aisle. “I hear 
you! I know where you are!” 

Uttering an animal cry of terror, I ran blindly to the end of the aisle, turned 
toward the doorway—and crashed into a low book cart. 

The cart toppled over as I fell on top of it. 

I landed hard on my stomach and knees. The camera bounced from my 
hand and slid across the floor. 

“I’ve got you now!” the monster growled, moving quickly from the next 


aisle.

I scrambled to get up, but my leg was caught in the cart. 

The monster lumbered toward me, panting loudly. 

Once again, my fear tried to paralyze me. I tried to push myself up with 
both hands, but my body felt as if it weighed a thousand pounds. 

I’m dead meat! I thought. 

Finally, I pushed myself up and freed myself from the cart. 

Dead meat. Dead meat. 

The panting, growling monster was only a few yards away now, lurching 
out of a row of shelves. 

I grabbed the camera and stumbled to the door, my knee throbbing, my 
head whirring. 

I’ll never make it. Never. 

And then I heard the loud electronic ringing. 

At first, I thought it was an alarm. 

But then I realized it was the telephone. 

I pulled myself into the doorway and turned. 

The monster hesitated at the end of the aisle. His bulbous, black eyes 
floated up above his face. His gaping mouth, drooling green liquid, twisted into 
an O of surprise. 

He stopped short, startled by the sudden interruption. 

Saved by the bell! I thought happily. I pulled open the heavy front door and 
burst out to freedom. 

I ran for two blocks, my sneakers slapping the pavement, my heart refusing 
to slow its frantic beat. I closed my eyes as I ran, enjoying the feel of the warm, 
fresh air on my face, the warmth of the late afternoon sun, the sweep of my hair 
flying behind me as I ran. Feeling free. Free and safe! 

When I opened my eyes and slowed my pace, I realized that I was gripping 
the camera so tightly, my hands hurt. 

My proof. I had my proof. 

One snapshot. One snapshot that nearly cost me my life. But I had it in the 
camera, my proof that Mr. Mortman was a monster. 



“I have to get it developed,” I said out loud. “Fast.” 

I jogged the rest of the way home, cradling the camera under my arm. 

As my house came into view, I had a chilling feeling that Mr. Mortman 
would be waiting there. That he would be waiting beside the front porch, waiting 
to grab the camera from me, to rob me of my proof. 

I hesitated at the bottom of the driveway. 

No one there. 

Was he hiding in the bushes? Around the side of the house? 

I walked up the front lawn slowly. You’re being stupid, I scolded myself. 
How could Mr. Mortman get here before you ? 

Besides, I wasn’t even sure he had recognized me. 

The lights were out in the library. The room was dark. The closest he had 
come was the aisle next to mine. And he was blinded for a long while from the 
camera flash. 

I started to breathe a little easier. Yes, it was possible that the librarian 
didn’t know who he was chasing. It was possible that he never got a good look at 
me at all. 

My dad’s car pulled up the drive as I reached the front porch. I went tearing 
after him, running around the side of the house to the back. 

“Dad! Hi!” I called as he climbed out of the car. 

“Hey, how’s it going?” he asked. His suit was rumpled. His hair was 
disheveled. He looked tired. 

“Dad, can we get this film developed—right away?” I demanded, shoving 
the camera toward him. 

“Whoa!” he cried. “I just got home. Let’s talk about it at dinner, okay?” 

“No, Dad—really!” I insisted. “I have to get this developed. There’s 
something very important on it.” 

He walked past me toward the house, his shoes crunching over the gravel 
driveway. 

I followed right behind, still holding my camera up high. “Please, Dad? It’s 
really important. Really really important!” 

He turned, chuckling. “What have you got? A picture of that boy who 
moved across the street?” 

“No,” I replied angrily. “I’m serious, Dad. Can’t you take me to the mall? 
There’s that one-hour developing place there.” 

“What’s so important?” he asked, his smile fading. He ran a hand over his 



head, smoothing down his thick, black hair. 

I had the urge to tell him. I had the urge to tell him I had a photo of the 
monster in there. But I stopped myself. 

I knew he wouldn’t believe me. I knew he wouldn’t take me seriously. 

And then he wouldn’t drive me to the mall to get my film developed. No 

way. 

“I’ll show it to you when it’s developed,” I said. 

He held open the screen door. We walked into the kitchen. Dad sniffed the 
air a couple of times, expecting the aroma of cooking food. 

Mom came bursting in from the hallway to greet us. “Don’t sniff,” she told 
my dad. “There’s nothing cooking. We’re eating out tonight.” 

“Great!” I cried. “Can we eat at the mall? At that Chinese restaurant you 
like?” I turned to my Dad. “Please? Please? Then I could get my film developed 
while we eat.” 

“I could go for Chinese food,” Mom said thoughtfully. Then she turned her 
gaze on me. “Why so eager to get your film developed?” 

“It’s a secret,” Dad said before I could reply. “She won’t tell.” 

I couldn’t hold it in any longer. “It’s a picture I snapped of Mr. Mortman,” I 
told them excitedly. “It’s my proof that he’s a monster.” 

Mom rolled her eyes. Dad shook his head. 

“It’s proof!” I insisted. “Maybe when you see the photo, you’ll finally 
believe me.” 

“You’re right,” Dad said sarcastically. “I’ll believe it when I see it.” 

“Randy! Hurry downstairs!” Mom shouted into the hallway. “We’re going 
to the mall for Chinese food!” 

“Aw, do we have to have Chinese food?” my brother called down 
unhappily. His standard reply. 

“I’ll get you the plain lo mein noodles you like,” Mom called up to him. 
“Just hurry. We’re all hungry.” 

I pushed the button on my camera to rewind the roll of film. “I’m going to 
drop this at the one-hour developing place before dinner,” I told them. “Then we 
can pick it up after dinner.” 

“No monster talk at dinner tonight—promise?” Mom said sternly. “I don’t 
want you scaring your brother.” 

“Promise,” I said, pulling the film roll out of the camera, squeezing it 
between my fingers. 



After dinner, I told myself, I won’t have to talk about monsters — I’ll show 
you one! 

Dinner seemed to take forever. 

Randy didn’t stop complaining the whole time. He said his noodles tasted 
funny. He said the spareribs were too greasy, and the soup was too hot. He 
spilled his glass of water all over the table. 

I barely paid any attention to what anyone said. I was thinking about my 
snapshot. I couldn’t wait to see it—and to show it to Mom and Dad. 

I could just imagine the looks on their faces when they saw that I was right, 
that I hadn’t been making it up—that Mr. Mortman really was a monster. 

I imagined both my parents apologizing to me, promising they’d never 
doubt me again. 

“I feel so bad,” I imagined my dad saying, “I’m going to buy you that 
computer you’ve been asking for.” 

“And a new bike,” I imagined Mom saying. “Please forgive us for doubting 
you.” 

“And I’m sorry, too,” I imagined Randy saying. “I know I’ve been a real 
jerk.” 

“And you can stay up till midnight every night from now on, even on 
school nights,” I imagined Dad saying. 

Suddenly, my mom’s voice broke into my daydreams. “Lucy, I don’t think 
you heard a word I said,” she scolded. 

“No... I... uh... was thinking about something,” I admitted. I picked up my 
chopsticks and raised a chunk of rice to my mouth. 

“She was thinking about monsters!” Randy cried, raising both hands up 
over the table, squeezing his fingers as if he were a monster about to attack me. 

“No monster talk!” Mom insisted sharply. 

“Don’t look at me!” I cried. “He said it—not me!” I pointed an accusing 
finger at Randy. 

“Just finish your dinner,” Dad said quietly. He had sparerib grease all over 
his chin. 

Finally, we were opening our fortune cookies. Mine said something about 
waiting for sunshine when the clouds part. I never get those fortunes. 

Dad paid the check. Randy nearly spilled another glass of water as we were 
standing up. I went running out of the restaurant. I was so excited, so eager, I 



couldn’t wait another second. 

The little photo store was on the upper level. I leapt onto the escalator, 
grabbed the rail, and rode to the top. Then I tore into the store, up to the counter, 
and called breathlessly to the young woman at the developing machine, “Are my 
photos ready yet?” 

She turned, startled by my loud voice. “I think so. What’s your name?” 

I told her. She walked over to a rack of yellow envelopes and began slowly 
shuffling through them. 

I tapped my fingers nervously on the counter-top, staring at the stack of 
yellow envelopes. Couldn’t she hurry it up a little? 

She shuffled all the way through the stack, then turned back to me. “What 
did you say your name was again?” 

Trying not to sound too exasperated, I told her my name again. I leaned 
eagerly on the counter-top, my heart pounding, and stared at her as she began 
once again to shuffle through the yellow envelopes, moving her lips as she read 
the names. 

Finally, she pulled one out and handed it to me. 

I grabbed it and started to tear it open. 

“That comes to fourteen dollars even,” she said. 

I realized I didn’t have any money. “I’ll have to get my dad,” I told her, not 
letting go of the precious package. 

I turned, and Dad appeared in the doorway. Mom and Randy waited 
outside. 

He paid. 

I carried the envelope of photos out of the store. My hands were shaking as 
I pulled it open and removed the snapshots. 

“Lucy, calm down,” Mom said, sounding worried. 

I stared down at the snapshots. All photos of Randy’s birthday party. 

I sifted through them quickly, staring at the grinning faces of Randy’s 
stupid friends. 

Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? 

Of course, it was the very last photo, the one on the bottom of the stack. 

“Here it is!” I cried. 

Mom and Dad leaned forward to see over my shoulder. 

The other photos fell from my hand and scattered over the floor as I raised 
the photo to my face— 



and gasped. 



17 


The photo was clear and sharp. 

Mr. Mortman’s large desk stood in the center in a burst of bright light. I 
could see papers on the desk, the pan of turtles at the far corner, a low pile of 
books. 

Behind the desk, I could see the top of Mr. Mortman’s tall wooden stool. 
And behind the stool, the shelves were in clear focus, even the glass jar of flies 
on the lower shelf. 

But there was no monster. 

No Mr. Mortman. 

No one. 

No one in the snapshot at all. 

“He—he was standing right there!” I cried. “Beside the desk!” 

“The room looks empty,” Dad said, staring down over my shoulder at the 
snapshot in my quivering hand. 

“There’s no one there,” Mom said, turning her gaze on me. 

“He was there,” I insisted, unable to take my eyes off the photo. “Right 
there.” I pointed to where the monster had stood. 

Randy laughed. “Let me see.” He pulled the photo from my hand and 
examined it. “I see him!” he declared. “He’s invisible!” 

“It isn’t funny,” I said weakly. I pulled the photo away from him. I sighed 
unhappily. I felt so bad. I wanted to sink into a hole in the floor and never come 
out. 

“He’s invisible!” Randy repeated gleefully, enjoying his own joke. 

Mom and Dad were staring at me, looks of concern on their faces. 

“Don’t you see?” I cried, waving the photo in one hand. “Don’t you see? 
This proves it! This proves he’s a monster. He doesn’t show up in photographs!” 

Dad shook his head and frowned. “Lucy, haven’t you carried this joke far 
enough?” 

Mom put a hand on my shoulder. “I’m starting to get worried about you,” 
she said softly. “I think you’re really starting to believe in your own monster 
joke.” 

“Can we get ice cream?” Randy asked. 



* * * 


“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Aaron complained. 

“Just shut up. You owe me!” I snapped. 

It was the next evening. We were crouched low, hiding behind the low 
shrubs at the side of the library. 

It was a crisp, cool day. The sun was already lowering itself behind the 
trees. The shadows stretched long and blue over the library lawn. 

“I owe you?” Aaron protested. “Are you crazy?” 

“You owe me,” I repeated. “You were supposed to come to the library with 
me yesterday, remember. You let me down.” 

He brushed a bug off his freckled nose. “Can I help it if I had an 
orthodontist appointment?” He sounded funny. His words were coming out all 
sticky. He wasn’t used to his new braces yet. 

“Yes,” I insisted. “I counted on you, and you let me down—and you got me 
in all kinds of trouble.” 

“What kind of trouble?” He dropped to the ground and sat cross-legged, 
keeping his head low behind the evergreen shrub. 

“My parents said I’m never again allowed to mention Mr. Mortman or the 
fact that he’s a monster,” I told him. 

“Good,” Aaron said. 

“Not good. It means I really need you, Aaron. I need you to see that I’m 
telling the truth, and tell my parents.” My voice broke. “They think I’m crazy. 
They really do!” 

He started to reply, but he could see I was really upset. So he stopped 
himself. 

A cool breeze swept past, making the trees all seem to whisper at us. 

I kept my eyes trained on the library door. It was five-twenty. Past closing 
time. Mr. Mortman should be coming out any second. 

“So we’re going to follow Mr. Mortman home?” Aaron asked, scratching 
the back of his. neck. “And spy on him at his house? Why don’t we just watch 
him through the library window?” 

“The window is too high,” I replied. “We have to follow him. He told me he 
walks home every evening. I want you to see him turn into a monster,” I said, 
staring straight ahead over the top of the bush. “I want you to believe me.” 



“What if I just say I believe you?” Aaron asked, grinning. “Then could we 
just go home?” 

“Ssshhh!” I pressed a hand over Aaron’s mouth. 

The library door was opening. Mr. Mortman appeared on the front steps. 

Aaron and I ducked down lower. 

I peered through the branches of the shrub. The librarian turned to lock the 
front door. He was wearing a red-and-white-striped short-sleeved sportshirt and 
baggy gray slacks. He had a red baseball cap on his bald head. 

“Stay far behind,” I whispered to Aaron. “Don’t let him see you.” 

“Good advice,” Aaron said sarcastically. 

We both shifted onto our knees and waited for Mr. Mortman to head down 
the sidewalk. He hesitated on the steps, replacing the keys in his pants pocket. 
Then, humming to himself, he walked down the driveway and turned away from 
us. 

“What’s he humming about?” Aaron whispered. 

“He always hums,” I whispered back. Mr. Mortman was more than half a 
block away. “Let’s go,” I said, climbing quickly to my feet. 

Keeping in the shadows of the trees and shrubs, I began following the 
librarian. Aaron followed just behind me. 

“Do you know where he lives?” Aaron asked. 

I turned back to him, frowning. “If I knew where he lived, we wouldn’t 
have to follow him—would we?” 

“Oh. Right.” 

Following someone was a lot harder than I thought. We had to cut through 
front yards. Some of them had barking dogs. Some had lawn sprinklers going. 
Some had thick hedges we somehow had to duck through. 

At every street corner, Mr. Mortman would stop and look both ways for 
oncoming cars. Each time, I was certain he was going to look over his shoulder, 
too, and see Aaron and me creeping along behind him. 

He lived farther from the library than I had thought. After several blocks, 
the houses ended, and a bare, flat field spread in front of us. 

Mr. Mortman cut through the field, walking quickly, swinging his stubby 
arms rhythmically with each step. We had no choice but to follow him across the 
field. There were no hiding place’s. No shrubs to duck behind. No hedges to 
shield us. 

We were completely out in the open. We just had to pray that he didn’t turn 



around in the middle of the field and see us. 

A block of small, older houses stood beyond the field. Most of the houses 
were brick, set close to the street on tiny front yards. 

Mr. Mortman turned onto a block of these houses. Aaron and I crouched 
behind a mailbox and watched him walk up to a house near the middle of the 
block. He stepped onto the small front stoop and fiddled in his pocket for the 
keys. 

“We’re here,” I whispered to Aaron. “We made it.” 

“My friend Ralph lives on this block, I think,” Aaron said. 

“Who cares?” I snapped. “Keep your mind on business, okay?” 

We waited until Mr. Mortman had disappeared through the front door of his 
house, then crept closer. 

His house was white clapboard, badly in need of a paint job. He had a small 
rectangle of a front yard, with recently cut grass bordered by a single row of tall, 
yellow tiger lilies. 

Aaron and I made our way quickly to the side of the house where there was 
a narrow strip of grass that led to the back. The window near the front of the 
house was high enough for us to stand under and not be seen. 

A light came on in the window. “That must be his living room,” I 
whispered. 

Aaron had a frightened expression. His freckles seemed a lot paler than 
usual. “I don’t like this,” he said. 

“The hard part was following him,” I assured Aaron. “This part is easy. We 
just watch him through the window.” 

“But the window is too high,” Aaron pointed out. “We can’t see anything.” 

He was right. Staring up from beneath the window, all I could see was the 
living room ceiling. 

“We’ll have to stand on something,” I said. 

“Huh? What?” 

I could see Aaron was going to be no help. He was so frightened, his nose 
was twitching like a bunny rabbit’s. I decided if I could keep him busy, maybe I 
could keep him from totally freaking and mnning away. 

“Go in back. See if there’s a ladder or something,” I whispered, motioning 
toward the back of the house. 

Another light came on, this one in a back window. Probably the kitchen, I 
figured. It was also too high to see into. 



“Wait. What about that?” Aaron asked. I followed his gaze to a 
wheelbarrow, tilted against the side of the house. 

“Yeah. Maybe,” I said. “Bring it over. I’ll try to stand on it.” 

Keeping his head and shoulders bent low, Aaron scampered over to the 
wheelbarrow. He lifted it away from the house by the handles, then pushed it 
under the front window. 

“Hold it steady,” I said. 

He grabbed the wooden handles, gazing up at me fearfully. “You sure about 
this?” 

“I’ll give it a try,” I said, glancing up at the high window. 

Holding onto Aaron’s shoulder, I gave myself a boost onto the 
wheelbarrow. He held firmly to the handles as I struggled to find my balance 
inside the metal basket part. 

“It—it’s kind of tilty,” I whispered, pressing one hand against the side of 
the house to steady myself. 

“I’m doing the best I can,” Aaron grumbled. 

“There. I think I can stand,” I said. I wasn’t very high off the ground, but I 
wasn’t at all comfortable. A wheelbarrow is a difficult thing to stand on. 

Somewhere down the block a dog barked. I hoped he wasn’t barking 
because of Aaron and me. 

Another dog, closer to us, quickly joined in, and it became a barking 
conversation. 

“Are you high enough? Can you see anything?” Aaron asked. 

One hand still pressed against the side of the house, I raised my head and 
peered into the house through the bottom of the window. 

“Yeah. I can see some,” I called down. “There’s a big aquarium in front of 
the window, but I can see most of the living room.” 

And just as I said that, Mr. Mortman’s face loomed inches from mine. 

He was staring right at me! 



18 


I gasped and lost my balance. 

I toppled to the ground, knocking over the wheelbarrow, landing hard on 
my knees and elbows. “Ow!” 

“What happened?” Aaron cried, alarmed. 

“He saw me!” I choked out, waiting for the pain to stop throbbing. 

“Huh?” Aaron’s mouth dropped open. 

We both gazed up at the window. I expected to see Mr. Mortman staring 
down at us. 

But no. No sign of him. 

I climbed quickly to my feet. “Maybe he was looking at his aquarium,” I 
whispered, motioning for Aaron to set up the wheelbarrow. “Maybe he didn’t see 
me.” 

“Wh-what are you going to do?” Aaron stammered. 

“Get back up, of course,” I told him. My legs were shaking as I climbed 
back onto the wheelbarrow. I grabbed the window ledge and pulled myself up. 

The sun had nearly gone down. The darkness outside made it easier to see 
inside the house. And, I hoped, harder for Mr. Mortman to see out. 

I didn’t have the best view in the world, I quickly realized. The aquarium, 
crowded with colorful tropical fish, blocked my view of most of the room. 

If only I were a little higher, I thought, I could see over it. But if I had been 
higher, I realized, Mr. Mortman would have seen me. 

“What’s he doing?” Aaron asked in a trembling whisper. 

“Nothing. He’s... wait!” 

Mr. Mortman was staring down at the fish. He stood only a few feet from 
me, on the other side of the aquarium. 

I froze, pressing my hands against the side of the house. 

He gazed down into his aquarium, and a smile formed on his pudgy face. 
He had removed the red baseball cap. His bald head looked yellow in the living 
room lamplight. 

His mouth moved. He was saying something to the tropical fish in the 
aquarium. I couldn’t hear him through the glass. 

Then, as he smiled down at his fish, he began to change. 



“He’s doing it,” I whispered to Aaron. “He’s turning into a monster.” 

As I watched Mr. Mortman’s head inflate and his eyes bulge out, I was 
filled with all kinds of strange feelings. I was terrified. And I was fascinated. It 
was exciting to be so close, inches away from a real monster. 

And I felt so happy and relieved that Aaron would finally see for himself 
that I was telling the truth. 

Then, as Mr. Mortman’s mouth grew wider and began to gyrate, a twisting 
black hole on his swollen, yellow face, fear overtook me. I froze there, my face 
pressed against the window, not blinking, not moving. 

I stared as he reached a hand into the aquarium. 

His fat fingers wrapped around a slender blue fish. He pulled it up and 
flipped it into his mouth. I could see long, yellow teeth inside the enormous 
mouth, biting down, chewing the wriggling fish. 

Then, as I gaped in growing terror, Mr. Mortman pulled a black snail off the 
side of the aquarium glass. Holding its shell between his fingertips, he stuffed 
the snail into his mouth. His teeth crunched down hard on the shell, cracking it— 
a crack so loud, I could hear it through the window glass. 

My stomach churned. I felt sick. 

He swallowed the snail, then reached to pull another one off the aquarium 
glass. 

“I think I’m going to toss my lunch,” I whispered down to Aaron. 

Aaron. 

I had forgotten all about him. 

I was so fascinated by the monster, so excited, so terrified to watch him 
close up, I had forgotten the whole purpose of being here. 

“Aaron, help me down,” I whispered. “Quick.” 

Still staring through the window, I reached a hand down for Aaron to take 
it. 

“Aaron—hurry! Help me down so you can climb up here. You have to see 
this! You have to see the monster!” 

He didn’t reply. 

“Aaron? Aaron?” 

I lowered my eyes from the window. 

Aaron had disappeared. 



19 


I felt a stab of panic in my chest. 

My entire body convulsed in a tremor of cold fear. 

Where was he? 

Had he run away? 

Was Aaron so frightened that he just took off without telling me? 

Or had something happened to him? Something really bad? 

“Aaron? Aaron?” In my panic, I forgot that I was inches away from a 
monster, and started to shout. “Aaron? Where are you?” 

“Ssh,” I heard a whisper from the back of the house. Aaron appeared, 
making his way quickly toward me along the narrow strip of grass. “I’m right 
here, Lucy.” 

“Huh? Where’d you go?” 

He pointed to the back. “I thought maybe I could find a ladder or 
something. You know. So I could see, too.” 

“You scared me to death!” I cried. 

I returned my glance to the window. Mr. Mortman was sucking a slithering 
eel into his mouth like a strand of spaghetti. 

“Quick, Aaron—help me down,” I instructed, still feeling shaken from the 
scare of his disappearance. “You have to see this. You have to. Before he 
changes back.” 

“He—he’s really a monster?” Aaron’s mouth dropped open. “You’re not 
joking?” 

“Just get up here!” I cried impatiently. 

But as I tried to lower myself to the ground, the wheelbarrow slid out from 
under me. 

It toppled onto its side, the handles scraping the side of the house. 

My hands shot up to grab the windowsill. I missed and fell heavily on top 
of the wheelbarrow. “Ow!” I cried out as sharp pain cut through my side. 

Glancing up, I saw the monster’s startled face, goggling down at me 
through the glass. 

I scrambled to get up. But the throbbing pain in my side took my breath 
away. 



“Aaron—help me! ” 

But he was already running to the street, his sneakers scraping the grass, his 
arms stretched straight in front of him as if trying to grab onto safety. 

Ignoring the pain in my side, I scrambled to my feet. 

I took an unsteady step, then another. I shook my head, trying to shake 
away my dizziness. 

Then I sucked in a deep breath and started to run, following Aaron toward 
the street. 

I had gone about four or five steps when I felt Mr. Mortman’s surprisingly 
strong hands grab my shoulders from behind. 



20 


I tried to scream, but no sound came out. 

He held firmly onto my shoulders. I could feel his hot, wet hands through 
my T-shirt. 

I tried to pull away, but he was too strong. 

He spun me around. 

His face was back to normal. 

He squinted at me with those little black eyes, as if he couldn’t believe what 
he was seeing. “Lucy!” he exclaimed in his scratchy voice. 

He let go of my shoulders and stepped back. 

I was panting loudly. I was so frightened, my chest felt about to explode. 

How had he changed back from his monster form so quickly? 

What was he going to do to me? 

“Lucy, good heavens. I thought you were a burglar,” he said, shaking his 
head. He removed a white handkerchief from his back pocket and wiped his 
perspiring forehead. 

“S-sorry,” I stammered. My voice came out in a choked whisper. 

He balled up the handkerchief between his fat hands and jammed it back 
into his pocket. “What are you doing here?” 

“Well...” My heart was pounding so hard, I could feel the blood pulse at 
my temples. My side still ached from where I had fallen on the wheelbarrow. 

I struggled to clear my mind. I had to think of an answer to his question. I 
had to. 

“Well...” I started again, thinking desperately. “I... uh... came to tell you 
that I’ll_uh... be a little late for my Reading Rangers appointment tomorrow.” 

He narrowed his eyes and stared at me thoughtfully. “But why were you 
looking through my window?” he demanded. 

“Well... I just...” 

Think, Lucy — think! 

“I didn’t know if you were home or not. I just was trying to see if you were 
there. I mean. So I could tell you. About the appointment tomorrow.” 

Staring into his face, trying to sound sincere, I took a step back, in case I 



had to make a run for it. 

Did he believe me? 

Was he buying it? 

I couldn’t tell. He continued to stare at me thoughtfully. 

He rubbed his chins. “You really didn’t have to come all the way out here,” 
he said softly. “Did you ride your bike?” His eyes darted over the small front 
lawn. 

“No. I... uh... walked. I like to walk,” I replied awkwardly. 

“It’s getting dark,” he said. “Maybe you should call your mom or dad to 
come pick you up. Why don’t you come inside and use the phone?” 

Come inside? 

Come inside the monster’s house? 

No way! 

“Uh... no thanks, Mr. Mortman,” I said, taking another step backwards 
toward the street. “My parents don’t mind if I walk home. It isn’t that far. 
Really.” 

“No. I insist,” he said, an odd grin starting across his molelike face. He 
motioned toward the house. “Come on in, Lucy. The phone is in the living 
room,” he urged. “Come on. I won’t bite.” 

I shuddered. 

I’d just seen him bite snails. And eels. 

There was no way I was going in that house. I knew that if I went in, 
chances are I’d never come out. 

“I—I’ve got to go,” I said, giving him a wave of one hand. I could feel the 
fear creeping up my back, running over my body. I knew if I didn’t get away 
from there —that moment —I’d be frozen by my terror, unable to escape. 

“Lucy—” Mr. Mortman insisted. 

“No. Really. Bye, Mr. Mortman.” I waved again, turned, and started jogging 
to the street. 

“You really shouldn’t have come all this way!” he called after me in his 
high, scratchy voice. “Really. You shouldn’t have!” 

I know! I thought. I know I shouldn’t have. 

I trotted along the street, turned the corner, and continued down the next 
block. 

Was I really getting away? 

Was he really letting me go? 



I couldn’t believe he’d bought my lame excuse. 

Why was he letting me get away? 

I slowed to a walk. My side still ached. I suddenly had a throbbing 
headache. 

Night had fallen. Passing cars had their headlights on. A slender trail of 
dark cloud drifted over a pale half-moon still low in the purple-gray sky. 

I was about to cross the street onto the broad, empty field when hands 
grabbed my shoulders again. 

I cried out, more of a yelp than a scream, and spun around, expecting to see 
the monster. 

“Aaron!” I cried. I swallowed hard, trying to force down my fear. “Where 

_ ?” 

“I waited for you,” he said. His voice trembled. 

His hands were knotted into fists. He looked about ready to burst into tears. 

“Aaron—” 

“I’ve been waiting all this time,” he said shrilly. “Where’ve you been? I’ve 
been so scared.” 

“I was... back there,” I told him. 

“I was ready to call the police or something,” Aaron said. “I was hiding 
down the block. I—” 

“You saw him?” I asked eagerly, suddenly remembering why we had risked 
our lives tonight. “You saw Mr. Mortman?” 

Aaron shook his head. “No, I didn’t. I was too far away.” 

“But earlier,” I said. “Through the window. When he was a monster. Didn’t 
you see him then? Didn’t you see him eat the snails and the eels?” 

Aaron shook his head again. “I didn’t see anything, Lucy,” he said softly. 
“I’m sorry. I wish I had.” 

Big help, I thought bitterly. 

Now what was I going to do? 



21 


“Mom—you don’t understand. I can’t go!” 

“Lucy, I’m not giving you a choice. You’re going, and that’s that.” 

It was the next afternoon, a stormy, gray day, and Mom and I were in the 
kitchen, arguing. I was trying to tell her there was no way I could go to my 
Reading Rangers meeting at the library. And she was insisting that I had to go. 

“Mom, you’ve got to believe me,” I pleaded. I was trying not to whine, but 
my voice kept creeping higher and higher. “Mr. Mortman is a monster. I can’t go 
to the library anymore.” 

Mom made a disgusted face and tossed down the dish towel she’d been 
folding. “Lucy, your father and I have had it up to here with your silly monster 
stories.” 

She turned to face me. Her expression was angry. “The fact is, Lucy dear, 
that you are a quitter. You never stick with anything. You’re lazy. That’s your 
problem.” 

“Mr. Mortman is a monster,” I interrupted. “That’s my problem.” 

“Well, I don’t care,” Mom replied sharply. “I don’t care if he turns into a 
drooling werewolf at night. You’re not quitting Reading Rangers. You’re going 
to your appointment this afternoon if I have to take you by the hand and walk 
you there myself.” 

“Gee—would you?” I asked. 

The idea flashed into my head that Mom could hide in the stacks and see 
for herself when Mr. Mortman turned into a monster. 

But I guess she thought I was being sarcastic. She just scowled and walked 
out of the kitchen. 

And so, an hour later, I was trudging up the stone steps to the old library. It 
was raining hard, but I didn’t take an umbrella. I didn’t care if I got drenched. 

My hair was soaked and matted on my head. I shook my head hard as I 
stepped into the entry-way, sending drops of water flying in all directions. 

I shivered, more from my fear, from being back in this frightening place, 
than from the cold. I pulled off my backpack. It was dripping wet, too. 

How can I face Mr. Mortman? I wondered as I made my way reluctantly 
into the main reading room. How can I face him after last night? 



He must surely suspect that I know his secret. 

He couldn X have believed me last night, could he? 

I was so furious at my mom for forcing me to come here. 

I hope he turns into a monster and chews me to bits! I thought bitterly. That 
will really teach Mom a lesson. 

I pictured Mom and Dad and Randy, sitting mournfully in our living room, 
crying their eyes out, wailing, “If only we had believed her! If only we had 
listened!” 

Holding my wet backpack in front of me like a shield, I made my way 
slowly past the long rows of books to the front of the room. 

To my relief, there were several people in the library. I saw two little kids 
with their mothers and a couple of other women browsing in the mystery book 
section. 

Great! I thought, starting to feel a little calmer. Mr. Mortman won’t dare do 
anything while the library is filled with people. 

The librarian was dressed in a green turtleneck today, which really made 
him look like a big, round turtle. He was stamping a stack of books and didn’t 
look up as I stepped close to the desk. 

I cleared my throat nervously. “Mr. Mortman?” 

It took him a long while to look up. When he finally did, a warm smile 
formed above his chins. “Hi, Lucy. Give me a few minutes, okay?” 

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll go dry off.” 

He seems very friendly, I thought, heading over to a chair at one of the long 
tables. He doesn’t seem angry at all. 

Maybe he really did believe my story last night. 

Maybe he really doesn’t know that I’ve seen him turn into a monster. 

Maybe I’ll get out of here alive.... 

I sat down at the table and shook some more water from my hair. I stared at 
the big, round wall clock, nervously waiting for him to call me up for our 
meeting. The clock ticked noisily. Each second seemed to take a minute. 

The kids with their mothers checked out some books and left. I turned to 
the mystery section and saw that the two women had also cleared out. The 
librarian and I were the only ones left. 

Mr. Mortman shoved a stack of books across his desk and stood up. “I’ll be 
right back, Lucy,” he said, another friendly, reassuring smile on his face. “Then 
we’ll have our meeting.” 



He stepped away from his desk and, walking briskly, headed to the back of 
the reading room. I guessed he was going to the bathroom or something. 

A jagged flash of white lightning flickered across the dark sky outside the 
window. It was followed by a drumroll of thunder. 

I stood up from the table and, carrying my wet backpack by the straps, 
started toward Mr. Mortman’s desk. 

I was halfway to the desk when I heard the loud click. 

I knew at once that he had locked the front door. 

A few seconds later, he returned, walking briskly, still smiling. He was 
mbbing his pudgy white hands together as he walked. 

“Shall we talk about your book?” he asked, stepping up to me. 

“Mr. Mortman—you locked the front door,” I said, swallowing hard. 

His smile didn’t fade. 

His dark little eyes locked on mine. 

“Yes. Of course,” he said softly, studying my face. His hands were still 
clasped together in front of him. 

“But—why?” I stammered. 

He brought his face close to mine, and his smile faded. “I know why you 
were at my house last night,” he growled into my ear. “I know everything.” 

“But, Mr. Mortman, I—” 

“I’m sorry,” he said in his throaty growl. “But I can’t let you leave, Lucy. I 
can’t let you leave the library.” 



22 


“Ohhh.” The sound escaped my lips, a moan of total terror. 

I stared at him without moving. I guess I wanted to see if he was serious or 
not. If he really meant what he said. 

His eyes told me he did. 

And as I stared at him, his head began to inflate. His tiny, round eyes shot 
out of their sockets and grew into throbbing, black bulbs. 

“Ohhh.” 

Again, the terrified sound escaped my lips. My entire body convulsed in a 
shudder of terror. 

His head was throbbing now, throbbing like a heart. His mouth opened into 
a gaping, gruesome leer, and green spittle ran down his quivering chin. 

Move! I told myself. Move, Lucy! DO something! 

His disgusting grin grew wider. His enormous head bobbed and throbbed 
excitedly. 

He uttered a low growl of attack. And reached out both arms to grab me. 

“No!” I shrieked. 

I leaned back and, with all my might, swung the backpack into his flabby 
stomach. 

It caught him by surprise. 

He gasped as it took his breath away. 

I let go of the backpack, spun around, and started to run. 

He was right behind me. I could hear his panting breath and low, menacing 
growls. 

I ran through a narrow aisle between two tall shelves. 

A rumble of thunder from outside seemed to shake the room. 

He was still behind me. Close. Closer. 

He was going to catch me, going to grab me from behind. 

I reached the end of the row. I hesitated. I didn’t know which way to turn. I 
couldn’t think. 

He roared, a monstrous animal sound. 

I turned left and started to run along the back wall of the room. 



Another rumble of thunder. 

“Ohh!” I realized to my horror that I’d made a mistake. 

A fatal mistake. 

I was running right into the corner. 

There was no exit here. No escape. 

He roared again, so loud that it drowned out the thunder. 

I was trapped. 

I knew it. 

Trapped. 

With a desperate cry, I ran blindly—headlong into the card catalogue. 
Behind me, I heard the monster’s roar of laughter. 

He knew he had won. 



23 


The card catalogue toppled over. Drawers came sliding out. Cards spilled at my 
feet, scattering over the floor. 

“Noooo!” the monster howled. At first I thought it was a victory cry. But 
then I realized it was an angry cry of protest. 

With a moan of horror, he stooped to the floor and began gathering up the 
cards. 

Staring in disbelief, I plunged past him, running frantically, my arms 
thrashing wildly at my sides. 

In that moment of terror, I remembered the one thing that librarians hate 
most: having cards from the card catalogue spilled on the floor! 

Mr. Mortman was a monster—but he was also a librarian. 

He couldn’t bear to have those cards in disorder. He had to try to replace 
them before chasing after me. 

It took only seconds to run into the front entryway, turn the lock, pull open 
the door, and flee out into the rain. 

My sneakers slapped the pavement as I ran, sending up splashes of 
rainwater. 

I made my way to the street and was halfway up the block when I realized 
he was chasing after me. 

A flash of lightning crackled to my left. 

I cried out, startled, as a deafening burst of thunder shook the ground. 

I glanced back to see how close the monster was. 

And stopped. 

With trembling hands, I frantically brushed a glaze of rainwater from my 

eyes. 

“Aaron!” I cried. “What are you doing here?” 

He ran up to me, hunching against the cold rain. He was breathing hard. His 
eyes were wide and frightened. “I—I was in the library,” he stammered, 
struggling to catch his breath. “Hiding. I saw it. I saw the monster. I saw 
everything.” 

“You did?” I was so happy. I wanted to hug him. 

A sheet of rain swept over us, driven by a gust of wind. 



“Let’s get to my house!” I cried. “You can tell my parents. Now maybe 
they’ll finally believe it!” 


* * * 


Aaron and I burst into the den. Mom looked up from the couch, lowering the 
newspaper to her lap. “You’re dripping on the mg,” she said. 

“Where’s Dad? Is he home yet?” I asked, rainwater running down my 
forehead. Aaron and I were soaked from head to foot. 

“Here I am.” He appeared behind us. He had changed out of his work 
clothes. “What’s all the excitement?” 

“It’s about the monster!” I blurted out. “Mr. Mortman—he—” 

Mom shook her head and started to raise a hand to stop me. 

But Aaron quickly came to my rescue. “I saw him, too!” Aaron exclaimed. 
“Lucy didn’t make it up. It’s true!” 

Mom and Dad listened to Aaron. I knew they would. 

He told them what he had seen in the library. He told them how the librarian 
had turned into a monster and chased me into the corner. 

Mom listened intently to Aaron’s story, shaking her head. “I guess Lucy’s 
story is true,” she said when Aaron had finished. 

“Yeah. I guess it is,” Dad said, putting a hand gently on my shoulder. 

“Well, now that you finally believe me—what are you going to do, Dad?” I 
demanded. 

He gazed at me thoughtfully. “We’ll invite Mr. Mortman for dinner,” he 

said. 

“Huh?” I goggled at him, rainwater running down my face. “You’ll what? 
He tried to gobble me up! You can’t invite him here!” I protested. “You can’t!” 
“Lucy, we have no choice,” Dad insisted. “We’ll invite him for dinner.” 



24 


Mr. Mortman arrived a few evenings later, carrying a bouquet of flowers. He was 
wearing lime-green trousers and a bright yellow, short-sleeved sport shirt. 

Mom accepted the flowers from him and led him into the living room 
where Dad, Randy, and I were waiting. I gripped the back of a chair tightly as he 
entered. My legs felt rubbery, and my stomach felt as if I’d swallowed a heavy 
rock. 

I still couldn’t believe that Dad had invited Mr. Mortman into our house! 

Dad stepped forward to shake hands with the librarian. “We’ve been 
meaning to invite you for quite a while,” Dad told him, smiling. “We want to 
thank you for the excellent reading program at the library.” 

“Yes,” Mom joined in. “It’s really meant a lot to Lucy.” 

Mr. Mortman glanced at me uncertainly. I could see that he was studying 
my expression. “I’m glad,” he said, forcing a tight-lipped smile. 

Mr. Mortman lowered himself onto the couch. Mom offered him a tray of 
crackers with cheese on them. He took one and chewed on it delicately. 

Randy sat down on the rug. I was still standing behind the armchair, 
gripping the back of it so tightly, my hands ached. I had never been so nervous in 
all my life. 

Mr. Mortman seemed nervous, too. When Dad handed him a glass of iced 
tea, Mr. Mortman spilled a little on his trousers. “It’s such a humid day,” he said. 
“This iced tea hits the spot.” 

“Being a librarian must be interesting work,” Mom said, taking a seat 
beside Mr. Mortman on the couch. 

Dad was standing at the side of the couch. 

They chatted for a while. As they talked, Mr. Mortman kept darting glances 
at me. Randy, sitting cross-legged on the floor, drummed his fingers on the 
carpet. 

Mom and Dad seemed calm and perfectly at ease. Mr. Mortman seemed a 
little uncomfortable. He had glistening beads of perspiration on his shiny, round 
forehead. 

My stomach growled loudly, more from nervousness than from hunger. No 
one seemed to hear it. 



The three adults chatted a while longer. Mr. Mortman sipped his iced tea. 

He leaned back on the couch and smiled at my mother. “It was so kind of 
you to invite me. I don’t get too many home-cooked meals. What’s for dinner?” 
he asked. 

“You are!” my Dad told him, stepping in front of the couch. 

“What?” Mr. Mortman raised a hand behind his ear. “I didn’t hear you 
correctly. What is for dinner?” 

“You are!” Dad repeated. 

“Ulllp!” Mr. Mortman let out a little cry and turned bright red. He struggled 
to raise himself from the low couch. 

But Mom and Dad were too fast for him. 

They both pounced on him. Their fangs popped down. And they gobbled 
the librarian up in less than a minute, bones and all. 

Randy laughed gleefully. 

I had a big smile on my face. 

My brother and I haven’t gotten our fangs yet. That’s why we couldn’t join 
in. 

“Well, that’s that,” Mom said, standing up and straightening the couch 
cushion. Then she turned to Randy and me. “That’s the first monster to come to 
Timberland Falls in nearly twenty years,” she told us. “That’s why it took us so 
long to believe you, Lucy.” 

“You sure gobbled him up fast!” I exclaimed. 

“In a few years, you’ll get your fangs,” Mom said. 

“Me, too!” Randy declared. “Then maybe I won’t be afraid of monsters 
anymore!” 

Mom and Dad chuckled. Then Mom’s expression turned serious. “You both 
understand why we had to do that, don’t you? We can’t allow any other monsters 
in town. It would frighten the whole community. And we don’t want people to 
get frightened and chase us away. We like it here!” 

Dad burped loudly. “Pardon me,” he said, covering his mouth. 

Later that night, I was upstairs in Randy’s room. He was all tucked in, and I was 
telling him a bedtime story. 

“...And so the librarian hid behind the tall bookshelf,” I said in a low, 
whispery voice. “And when the little boy named Randy reached up to pull a 
book down from the shelf, the librarian stuck his long arms through the shelf and 



grabbed the boy, and—” 

“Lucy, how many times do I have to tell you?” 

I glanced up to see Mom standing in the doorway, a frown on her face. 

“I don’t want you frightening your little brother before bedtime,” Mom 
scolded. “You’ll give him nightmares. Now, come on, Lucy—no more monster 
stories!” 





WELCOME TO 
CAMP NIGHTMARE 
Goosebumps - 09 
R.L. Stine 



1 


I stared out the dusty window as the camp bus bounced over the narrow, winding 
road. I could see sloping red hills in the distance beneath a bright yellow sky. 

Stumpy white trees lined the road like fence posts. We were way out in the 
wilderness. We hadnt passed a house or a farm for nearly an hour. 

The bus seats were made of hard blue plastic. When the bus hit a bump, we 
all bounced up off our seats. Everyone laughed and shouted. The driver kept 
growling at us, yelling for us to pipe down. 

There were twenty-two kids going to camp on the bus. I was sitting in the 
back row on the aisle, so I could count them all. 

There were eighteen boys and only four girls. I guessed that the boys were 
all going to Camp Nightmoon, which is where I was going. The girls were going 
to a girls camp nearby. 

The girls sat together in the front rows and talked quietly to each other. 
Every once in a while, theyd glance back quickly to check out the boys. 

The boys were a lot louder than the girls, cracking jokes, laughing, making 
funny noises, shouting out dumb things. It was a long bus ride, but we were 
having a good time. 

The boy next to me was named Mike. He had the window seat. Mike 
looked a little like a bulldog. He was kind of chubby, with a round face and 
pudgy arms and legs. He had short, spiky black hair, which he scratched a lot. 
He was wearing baggy brown shorts and a sleeveless green T-shirt. 

We had been sitting together the whole trip, but Mike didnt say much. I 
figured he was shy, or maybe very nervous. He told me this was his first time at 
sleepaway camp. 

It was my first time, too. And I have to admit that, as the bus took me 
farther and farther from my home, I was already starting to miss my mom and 
dad just a little. 

Im twelve, but Ive never really stayed away from home before. Even 
though the long bus ride was fun, I had this sad kind of feeling. And I think 
Mike was feeling the same way. 

He pressed his chubby face against the window glass and stared out at the 
red hills rolling by in the distance. 



Are you okay, Mike? I asked. 

Yeah. Sure, Billy, he replied quickly without turning around. 

I thought about my mom and dad. Back at the bus station, they had seemed 
so serious. I guess they were nervous, too, about me going off to camp for the 
first time. 

Well write every day, Dad said. 

Do your best, Mom said, hugging me harder than usual. 

What a weird thing to say. Why didnt she say, Have a good time? Why did 
she say, Do your best? 

As you can tell, Im a bit of a worrier. 

The only other boys Id met so far were the two in the seat in front of us. 
One was named Colin. He had long brown hair down to his collar, and he wore 
silver sunglasses so you couldnt see his eyes. He acted kind of tough, and he 
wore a red bandanna on his forehead. He kept tying and untying the bandanna. 

Sitting next to him in the seat on the aisle was a big, loud kid named Jay. 
Jay talked a lot about sports and kept bragging about what a good athlete he was. 
He liked showing off his big, muscular arms, especially when one of the girls 
turned around to check us out. 

Jay teased Colin a lot and kept wrestling with him, gripping Colins head in 
a headlock and messing up Colins bandanna. You know. Just kidding around. 

Jay had wild, bushy red hair that looked as if it had never been brushed. He 
had big blue eyes. He never stopped grinning and horsing around. He spent the 
whole trip telling gross jokes and shouting things at the girls. 

Heywhats your name? Jay called to a blond-haired girl who sat at the front 
by the window. 

She ignored him for a long time. But the fourth time Jay called out the 
question, she turned around, her green eyes flashing. Dawn, she replied. Then 
she pointed to the red-haired girl next to her. And this is my friend Dori. 

Heythats amazing! My name is Dawn, too! Jay joked. 

A lot of the guys laughed, but Dawn didnt crack a smile. Nice to meet you, 
Dawn, she called back to him. Then she turned around to the front. 

The bus bounced over a hole in the road, and we all bounced with it. 

Hey, look, Billy, Mike said suddenly, pointing out the window. 

Mike hadnt said anything for a long time. I leaned toward the window, 
trying to see what he was pointing at. 

I think I saw a prairie cat, he said, still staring hard. 



Huh? Really? I saw a clump of low white trees and a lot of jagged red 
rocks. But I couldnt see any prairie cats. 

It went behind those rocks, Mike said, still pointing. Then he turned toward 
me. Have you seen any towns or anything? 

I shook my head. Just desert. 

But isnt the camp supposed to be near a town? Mike looked worried. 

I dont think so, I told him. My dad told me that Camp Nightmoon is past 
the desert, way out in the woods. 

Mike thought about this for a while, frowning. Well, what if we want to call 
home or something? he asked. 

They probably have phones at the camp, I told him. 

I glanced up in time to see Jay toss something up toward the girls at the 
front. It looked like a green ball. It hit Dawn on the back of the head and stuck in 
her blond hair. 

Hey! Dawn cried out angrily. She pulled the sticky green ball from her hair. 
What is this? She turned to glare at Jay. 

Jay giggled his high-pitched giggle. I dont know. I found it stuck under the 
seat! he called to her. 

Dawn scowled at him and heaved the green ball back. It missed Jay and hit 
the rear window, where it stuck with a loud plop. 

Everyone laughed. Dawn and her friend Dori made faces at Jay. 

Colin fiddled with his red bandanna. Jay slumped down low and raised his 
knees against the seat in front of him. 

A few rows ahead of me, two grinning boys were singing a song we all 
knew but with really gross words replacing the original words. 

A few other kids began to sing along. 

Suddenly, without warning, the bus squealed to a stop, the tires skidding 
loudly over the road. 

We all cried out in surprise. I bounced off my seat, and my chest hit the seat 
in front of me. 

Ugh! That hurt. 

As I slid back in the seat, my heart still pounding, the bus driver stood up 
and turned to us, leaning heavily into the aisle. 

Ohh! Several loud gasps filled the bus as we saw the drivers face. 

His head was enormous and pink, topped with a mop of wild bright blue 
hair that stood straight up. He had long, pointed ears. His huge red eyeballs 



bulged out from their dark sockets, bouncing in front of his snoutlike nose. 
Sharp white fangs drooped from his gaping mouth. A green liquid oozed over his 
heavy black lips. 

As we goggled in silent horror, the driver tilted back his monstrous head 
and uttered an animal roar. 



2 


The driver roared so loud, the bus windows rattled. 

Several kids shrieked in fright. 

Mike and I both ducked down low, hiding behind the seat in front of us. 

Hes turned into a monster! Mike whispered, his eyes wide with fear. 

Then we heard laughter at the front of the bus. 

I raised myself up in time to see the bus driver reach one hand up to his 
bright blue hair. He tuggedand his face slid right off! 

Ohhh! Several kids shrieked in horror. 

But we quickly realized that the face dangling from the drivers hand was a 
mask. He had been wearing a rubber monster mask. 

His real face was perfectly normal, I saw with relief. He had pale skin, 
short, thinning black hair, and tiny blue eyes. He laughed, shaking his head, 
enjoying his joke. 

This fools em every time! he declared, holding up the ugly mask. 

A few kids laughed along with him. But most of us were too surprised and 
confused to think it was funny. 

Suddenly, his expression changed. Everybody out! he ordered gruffly. 

He pulled a lever and the door slid open with a whoosh. 

Where are we? someone called out. 

But the driver ignored the question. He tossed the mask onto the drivers 
seat. Then, lowering his head so he wouldnt bump the roof, he quickly made his 
way out the door. 

I leaned across Mike and stared out the window, but I couldnt see much. 
Just mile after mile of flat yellow ground, broken occasionally by clumps of red 
rock. It looked like a desert. 

Why are we getting out here? Mike asked, turning to me. I could see he was 
really worried. 

Maybe this is the camp, I joked. Mike didnt think that was funny. 

We were all confused as we pushed and shoved our way off the bus. Mike 
and I were the last ones off since we were sitting in the back. 

As I stepped onto the hard ground, I shielded my eyes against the bright 
sunlight high in the afternoon sky. We were in a flat, open area. The bus was 



parked beside a concrete platform, about the size of a tennis court. 

It must be some kind of bus station or something, I told Mike. You know. A 
drop-off point. 

He had his hands shoved into the pockets of his shorts. He kicked at the dirt 
but didnt say anything. 

On the other side of the platform, Jay was messing around with a boy I 
hadnt met yet. Colin was leaning against the side of the bus, being cool. The four 
girls were standing in a circle near the front of the platform, talking quietly about 
something. 

I watched the driver walk over to the side of the bus and pull open the 
luggage compartment. He began pulling out bags and camp trunks and carrying 
them to the concrete platform. 

A couple of guys had sat down on the edge of the platform to watch the 
driver work. Across the platform, Jay and the other guy started a contest, tossing 
little red pebbles as far as they could. 

Mike, his hands still buried in his pockets, stepped up behind the sweating 
bus driver. Hey, where are we? Why are we stopping here? Mike asked him 
nervously. 

The driver slid a heavy black trunk from the back of the luggage 
compartment. He completely ignored Mikes questions. Mike asked them again. 
And again the driver pretended Mike wasnt there. 

Mike made his way back to where I was standing, walking slowly, dragging 
his shoes across the hard ground. He looked really worried. 

I was confused, but I wasnt worried. I mean, the bus driver was calmly 
going about his business, unloading the bus. He knew what he was doing. 

Why wont he answer me? Why wont he tell us anything? Mike demanded. 

I felt bad that Mike was so nervous. But I didnt want to hear any more of 
his questions. He was starting to make me nervous, too. 

I wandered away from him, making my way along the side of the platform 
to where the four girls were standing. Across the platform, Jay and his buddies 
were still having their stone-throwing contest. 

Dawn smiled at me as I came closer. Then she glanced quickly away. Shes 
really pretty, I thought. Her blond hair gleamed in the bright sunlight. 

Are you from Center City? her friend Dori asked, squinting at me, her 
freckled face twisted against the sun. 

No, I told her. Im from Midlands. Its north of Center City. Near Outreach 



Bay. 

I know where Midlands is! Dori snapped snottily. The other three girls 
laughed. 

I could feel myself blushing. 

Whats your name? Dawn asked, staring at me with her green eyes. 

Billy, I told her. 

My birds name is Billy! she exclaimed, and the girls all laughed again. 

Where are you girls going? I asked quickly, eager to change the subject. I 
mean, what camp? 

Camp Nightmoon. Theres one for boys and one for girls, Dori answered. 
This is an all-Camp Nightmoon bus. 

Is your camp near ours? I asked. I didnt even know there was a Camp 
Nightmoon for girls. 

Dori shrugged. We dont know, Dawn replied. This is our first year. 

All of us, Dori added. 

Me, too, I told them. I wonder why we stopped here. 

The girls all shrugged. 

I saw that Mike was lingering behind me, looking even more scared. I 
turned and made my way back to him. 

Look. The driver is finished carrying out our stuff, he said, pointing. 

I turned in time to see the driver slam the luggage compartment door shut. 

Whats happening? Mike cried. Is someone picking us up here? Why did he 
unload all our stuff? 

Ill go find out, I said quietly. I started to jog over to the driver. He was 
standing in front of the open bus door, mopping his perspiring forehead with the 
short sleeve of his tan drivers uniform. 

He saw me comingand quickly climbed into the bus. He slid into the drivers 
seat, pulling a green sun visor down over his forehead as I stepped up to the 
door. 

Is someone coming for us? I called in to him. 

To my surprise, he pulled the lever, and the bus door slammed shut in my 

face. 

The engine started up with a roar and a burst of gray exhaust fumes. 

Hey! I screamed, and pounded angrily on the glass door. 

I had to leap back as the bus squealed away, its tires spinning noisily on the 
hard dirt. Hey! I shouted. You dont have to run me over! 



I stared angrily as the bus bounced onto the road and roared away. Then I 
turned back to Mike. He was standing beside the four girls. They were all 
looking upset now. 

Hehe left, Mike stammered as I approached them. He just left us here in the 
middle of nowhere. 

We gazed down the road at the bus until it disappeared over the darkening 
horizon. We all grew very quiet. 

A few seconds later, we heard the frightening animal cries. 

Very close. And getting closer. 



3 


Wh-whats that? Mike stammered. 

We turned in the direction of the shrill cries. 

They seemed to be coming from across the platform. At first, I thought that 
Jay and Colin and their friends were playing a joke on us, making the animal 
cries to frighten us. 

But then I saw the scared, wide-eyed expressions on their faces. Jay, Colin, 
and the others had frozen in place. They werent making the noises. 

The cries grew louder. Closer. 

Shrill warnings. 

And then, staring into the distance beyond the platform, I saw them. Small, 
dark creatures, keeping low, rolling rapidly along the flat ground, tossing their 
heads back and uttering excited shrieks as they came toward us. 

What are they? Mike cried, moving close to me. 

Are they prairie wolves? Dori asked in a trembling voice. 

I hope not! one of the other girls called out. 

We all climbed onto the concrete platform and huddled behind our trunks 
and bags. 

The animal cries grew louder as the creatures drew near. I could see dozens 
of them. They scurried toward us over the flat ground as if being blown by the 
wind. 

Help! Somebody help us! I heard Mike scream. 

Next to me, Jay still had two of the red pebbles from his stone-throwing 
competition in his hand. Pick up rocks! he was shouting frantically. Maybe we 
can scare them away! 

The creatures stopped a few yards from the concrete platform and raised 
themselves up menacingly on their hind feet. 

Huddled between Mike and Jay, I could see them clearly now. They were 
wolves or wildcats of some sort. Standing upright, they were nearly three feet 
tall. 

They had slender, almost scrawny bodies covered with spotty red-brown 
fur. Their paws had long silvery claws growing out of them. Their heads were 
nearly as slender as their bodies. Tiny red weasel eyes stared hungrily at us. 



Their long mouths snapped open and shut, revealing double rows of silvery, 
daggerlike teeth. 

No! No! Help! Mike dropped to his knees. His entire body convulsed in a 
shudder of terror. 

Some of the kids were crying. Others gaped at the advancing creatures in 
stunned silence. 

I was too scared to cry out or move or do anything. 

I stared at the row of creatures, my heart thudding, my mouth as dry as 
cotton. 

The creatures grew silent. Standing a few feet from the platform, they eyed 
us, snapping their jaws loudly, hungrily. White froth began to drip from their 
mouths. 

Theytheyre going to attack! a boy yelled. 

They look hungry! I heard one of the girls say. 

The white froth poured thickly over their pointed teeth. They continued to 
snap their jaws. It sounded like a dozen steel traps being snapped shut. 

Suddenly, one of them leaped onto the edge of the platform. 

No! several kids cried out in unison. 

We huddled closer together, trying to stay behind the pile of trunks and 

bags. 

Another creature climbed onto the platform. Then three more. 

I took a step back. 

I saw Jay pull back his arm and heave a red rock at one of the frothing 
creatures. The rock hit the platform with a crack and bounced away. 

The creatures were not frightened. They arched their backs, preparing to 
attack. 

They began to make a high-pitched chattering sound. 

And moved nearer. Nearer. 

Jay threw another rock. 

This one hit one of the advancing creatures on the side. It uttered a shrill 
eek of surprise. But it kept moving steadily forward, its red eyes trained on Jay, 
its jaws snapping hungrily. 

Go away! Dori cried in a trembling voice. Go home! Go away! Go away! 

But her shouts had no effect. 

The creatures advanced. 

Run! I urged. Run! 



We cant outrun them! someone shouted. 

The shrill chittering grew louder. Deafening. Until it seemed as if we were 
surrounded by a wall of sound. 

The ugly creatures lowered themselves to pounce. 

Run! I repeated. Come onrun! 

My legs wouldnt cooperate. They felt rubbery and weak. 

Trying to back away from the attacking creatures, I toppled over backward 
off the platform. 

I saw flashing stars as the back of my head hit the hard ground. 

Theyre going to get me, I realized. 

I cant get away.

I heard the sirenlike attack cry. 

I heard the scrape of the creatures long claws over the concrete platform. 

I heard the screams and cries of the frightened campers. 

Then, as I struggled frantically to pull myself up, I heard the deafening roar. 

At first I thought it was an explosion. 

I thought the platform had blown up. 

But then I turned and saw the rifle. 

Another explosion of gunfire. White smoke filled the air. 

The creatures spun around and darted away, silent now, their scraggly fur 
scraping the ground as they kept low, their tails between their furry legs. 

Ha-ha! Look at em run! A man kept a rifle poised on his shoulder as he 
watched the creatures retreat. 

Behind him stood a long green bus. 

I pulled myself up and brushed myself off. 

Everyone was laughing now, jumping up and down joyfully, celebrating the 
narrow escape. 

I was still too shaken up to celebrate. 

Theyre running like jackrabbits! the man declared in a booming voice. He 
lowered the rifle. 

It took me a while to realize he had come out of the camp bus to rescue us. 
We hadnt heard or seen the bus pull up because of the attack cries of the animals. 

Are you okay, Mike? I asked, walking over to my frightened-looking new 
friend. 

I guess, he replied uncertainly. I guess Im okay now. 

Dawn slapped me on the back, grinning. Were okay! she cried. Were all 
okay! 

We gathered in front of the man with the rifle. 

He was big and red-faced, mostly bald except for a fringe of curly yellow 
hair around his head. He had a blond mustache under an enormous beak of a 
nose and tiny black bird eyes beneath bushy blond eyebrows. 

Hi, guys! Im Uncle Al. Im your friendly camp director. I hope you enjoyed 



that welcome to Camp Nightmoon! he boomed in a deep voice. 

I heard muttered replies. 

He leaned the rifle against the bus and took a few steps toward us, studying 
our faces. He was wearing white shorts and a bright green camp T-shirt that 
stretched over his big belly. Two young guys, also in green and white, stepped 
out of the bus, serious expressions on their faces. 

Lets load up, Uncle A1 instructed them in his deep voice. 

He didnt apologize for being late. 

He didnt explain about the weird animals. And he didnt ask if we were okay 
after that scare. 

The two counselors began dragging the camp trunks and shoving them into 
the luggage compartment on the bus. 

Looks like a good group this year, Uncle A1 shouted. Well drop you girls 
off first across the river. Then well get you boys settled in. 

What were those awful animals? Dori called to Uncle Al. 

He didnt seem to hear her. 

We began climbing onto the bus. I looked for Mike and found him near the 
end of the line. His face was pale, and he still looked really shaken. II was really 
scared, he admitted. 

But were okay, I reassured him. Now we can relax and have fun. 

Im so hungry, Mike complained. I havent eaten all day. 

One of the counselors overheard him. You wont be hungry when you taste 
the camp food, he told Mike. 

We piled into the bus. I sat next to Mike. I could hear the poor guys 
stomach growling. I suddenly realized I was starving, too. And I was really eager 
to see what Camp Nightmoon looked like. I hoped it wouldnt be a long bus ride 
to get there. 

How far away is our camp? I called to Uncle Al, who had slid into the 
drivers seat. 

He didnt seem to hear me. 

Hey, Mike, were on our way! I said happily as the bus pulled onto the road. 

Mike forced a smile. Im so glad to get away from there! 

To my surprise, the bus ride took less than five minutes. 

We all muttered our shock at what a short trip it was. Why hadnt the first 
bus taken us all the way? 

A big wooden sign proclaiming camp nightmoon came into view, and Uncle 



A1 turned the bus onto a gravel road that led through a patch of short trees into 
the camp. 

We followed the narrow, winding road across a green river. Several small 
cabins came into view. Girls camp, Uncle A1 announced. The bus stopped to let 
the four girls off. Dawn waved to me as she climbed down. 

A few minutes later, we pulled into the boys camp. Through the bus 
window I could see a row of small white cabins. On top of a gently sloping hill 
stood a large white-shingled building, probably a meeting lodge or mess hall. 

At the edge of a field, three counselors, all dressed in white shorts and 
green T-shirts, were working to start a fire in a large stone barbecue pit. 

Hey, were going to have a cookout! I exclaimed to Mike. I was starting to 
feel really excited. 

Mike smiled, too. He was practically drooling at the thought of food! 

The bus came to an abrupt stop at the end of the row of small bunks. Uncle 
A1 pulled himself up quickly from the drivers seat and turned to us. Welcome to 
beautiful Camp Nightmoon! he bellowed. Step down and line up for your bunk 
assignments. Once you get unpacked and have dinner, Ill see you at the 
campfire. 

We pushed our way noisily out of the bus. I saw Jay enthusiastically 
slapping another boy on the back. I think we were all feeling a lot better, 
forgetting about our close call. 

I stepped down and took a deep breath. The cool air smelled really sweet 
and fresh. I saw a long row of short evergreen trees behind the white lodge on 
the hill. 

As I took my place in line, I searched for the waterfront. I could hear the 
soft rush of the river behind a thick row of evergreens, but I couldnt see it. 

Mike, Jay, Colin, and I were assigned to the same bunk. It was Bunk 4. I 
thought the bunk should have a more interesting name. But it just had a number. 
Bunk 4. 

It was really small, with a low ceiling and windows on two sides. It was just 
big enough for six campers. There were bunk beds against three walls and a tall 
dresser on the fourth wall, with a little square of space in the middle. 

There was no bathroom. I guessed it was in another building. 

As the four of us entered the bunk, we saw that one of the beds had already 
been claimed. It had been carefully made, the green blanket tucked in neatly, 
some sports magazines and a radio resting on top. 



That must belong to our counselor, Jay said, inspecting the radio. 

Hope we dont have to wear those ugly green T-shirts, Colin said, grinning. 
He was still wearing his silver sunglasses, even though the sun was nearly down 
and it was just about as dark as night in the cabin. 

Jay claimed a top bunk, and Colin took the bed beneath his. 

Can I have a lower one? Mike asked me. I roll around a lot at night. Im 
afraid I might fall out of a top one. 

Yeah. Sure. No problem, I replied. I wanted the top bunk anyway. It would 
be a lot more fun. 

Hope you guys dont snore, Colin said. 

Were not going to sleep in here anyway, Jay said. Were going to party all 
night! He playfully slapped Mike on the back, so hard that Mike went sprawling 
into the dresser. 

Hey! Mike whined. That hurt! 

Sorry. Guess I dont know my own strength, Jay replied, grinning at Colin. 

The cabin door opened, and a redheaded guy with dark freckles all over his 
face walked in, carrying a big gray plastic bag. He was tall and very skinny and 
was wearing white shorts and a green camp T-shirt. 

Hey, guys, he said, and dropped the large bag on the cabin floor with a 
groan. He checked us out, then pointed to the bag. Theres your bed stuff, he said. 
Make your beds. Try to make them as neat as mine. He pointed to the bunk 
against the window with the radio on it. 

Are you our counselor? I asked. 

He nodded. Yeah. Im the lucky one. He turned and started to walk out. 

Whats your name? Jay called after him. 

Larry, he said, pushing open the cabin door. Your trunks will be here in a 
few minutes, he told us. You can fight it out over drawer space. Two of the 
drawers are stuck shut. 

He started out the door, then turned back to us. Keep away from my stuff. 
The door slammed hard behind him. 

Peering out the window, I watched him lope away, taking long, fast strides, 
bobbing his head as he walked. 

Great guy, Colin muttered sarcastically. 

Real friendly, Jay added, shaking his head. 

Then we dived into the plastic bag and pulled out sheets and wool blankets. 
Jay and Colin got into a wrestling match over a blanket they claimed was softer 



than the others. 

I tossed a sheet onto my mattress and started to climb up to tuck it in. 
I was halfway up the ladder when I heard Mike scream. 



5 


Mike was right beneath me, making his bed. He screamed so loud, I cried out 
and nearly fell off the ladder. 

I leaped off the ladder, my heart pounding, and stepped beside him. 

Staring straight ahead, his mouth wide open in horror, Mike backed away 
from his bed. 

Mikewhats wrong? I asked. What is it? 

S-snakes! Mike stammered, staring straight ahead at his unmade bed as he 
backed away. 

Huh? I followed his gaze. It was too dark to see anything. 

Colin laughed. Not that old joke! he cried. 

Larry put rubber snakes in your bed, Jay said, grinning as he stepped up 
beside us. 

Theyre not rubber! Theyre real! Mike insisted, his voice trembling. 

Jay laughed and shook his head. I cant believe you fell for that old gag. He 
took a few steps toward the bedthen stopped. Hey! 

I moved close, and the two snakes came into focus. Raising themselves 
from the shadows, they arched their heads, pulling back as if preparing to attack. 

Theyre real! Jay cried, turning back to Colin. Two of them! 

Probably not poisonous, Colin said, venturing closer. 

The two let out angry hisses, raising themselves high off the bed. They were 
very long and skinny. Their heads were wider than their bodies. Their tongues 
flicked from side to side as they arched themselves menacingly. 

Im scared of snakes, Mike uttered in a soft voice. 

Theyre probably scared of youl Jay joked, slapping Mike on the back. 

Mike winced. He was in no mood for Jays horseplay. Weve got to get Larry 
or somebody, Mike said. 

No way! Jay insisted. You can handle em, Mike. Theres only two of them! 

Jay gave Mike a playful shove toward the bed. He only meant to give him a 
scare. 

But Mike stumbledand fell onto the bed. 

The snakes darted in unison. 



I saw one of them clamp its teeth into Mikes hand. 

Mike raised himself to his feet. He didnt react at first. Then he uttered a 
high-pitched shriek. 

Two drops of blood appeared on the back of his right hand. He stared down 
at them, then grabbed the hand. 

It bit me! he shrieked. 

Oh, no! I cried. 

Did it puncture the skin? Colin asked. Is it bleeding? 

Jay rushed forward and grabbed Mikes shoulder. Hey, manlm really sorry, 
he said. I didnt mean to 

Mike groaned in pain. Itreally hurts, he whispered. He was breathing really 
hard, his chest heaving, making weird noises as he breathed. 

The snakes, coiled in the middle of his lower bunk, began to hiss again. 

Youd better hurry to the nurse, Jay said, his hand still on Mikes shoulder. Ill 
come with you. 

N-no, Mike stammered. His face was as pale as a ghosts. He held his hand 
tightly. Ill go find her! He burst out of the cabin, running at full speed. The door 
slammed behind him. 

Heyl didnt mean to push him, you know, Jay explained to us. I could see he 
was really upset. I was just joking, just trying to scare him a little. I didnt mean 
for him to fall or anything. His voice trailed off. 

What are we going to do about them ? I asked, pointing at the two coiled 
snakes. 

Ill get Larry, Colin offered. He started toward the door. 

No, wait. I called him back. Look. Theyve moved onto Mikes sheet, right? 

Jay and Colin followed my gaze to the bed. The snakes arched themselves 
high, preparing to bite again. 

So? Jay asked, scratching his disheveled hair. 

So we can wrap them up in the sheet and carry them outside, I said. 

Jay stared at me. Wish Id thought of that. Lets do it, man! 

Youll get bit, Colin warned. 

I stared at the snakes. They seemed to be studying me, too. They cant bite 
us through the sheet, I said. 

They can try! Colin exclaimed, hanging back. 

If were fast enough, I said, taking a cautious step toward the bed, we can 
wrap them up before they know whats happening. 



The snakes hissed out a warning, drawing themselves higher. 

How did they get in here, anyway? Colin asked. 

Maybe the camp is crawling with snakes, Jay said, grinning. Maybe youve 
got some in your bed, too, Colin! He laughed. 

Lets get serious here, I said sternly, my eyes locked on the coiled snakes. 
Are we going to try this or not? 

Yeah. Lets do it, Jay answered. I mean, I owe it to Mike. 

Colin remained silent. 

Ill bet I could grab one by the tail and swing him out through the window, 
Jay said. You could grab the tail end of the other one and 

Lets try my plan first, I suggested quietly. 

We crept over to the snakes, sneaking up on them. It was kind of silly since 
they were staring right at us. 

I pointed to one end of the sheet, which was folded up onto the bed. Grab it 
there, I instructed Jay. Then pull it up. 

He hesitated. What if I miss? Or you miss? 

Then were in trouble, I replied grimly. My eyes on the snakes, I reached my 
hand forward to the other corner of the sheet. Ready? On three, I whispered. 

My heart was in my mouth. I could barely choke out, One, two, three. 

At the count of three, we both grabbed for the ends of the sheet. 

Pull! I cried in a shrill voice I couldnt believe was coming from me. 

We pulled up the sheet and brought the ends together, making a bundle. 

At the bottom of the bundle, the snakes wriggled frantically. I heard their 
jaws snap. They wriggled so hard, the bottom of the bundle swung back and 
forth. 

They dont like this, Jay said as we hurried to the door, carrying our 
wriggling, swaying bundle between us, trying to keep our bodies as far away 
from it as possible. 

I pushed open the door with my shoulder, and we ran out onto the grass. 

Now what? Jay asked. 

Keep going, I replied. I could see one of the snakes poking its head out. 
Hurry! 

We ran past the cabins toward a small clump of shrubs. Beyond the shrubs 
stood a patch of low trees. When we reached the trees, we swung the bundle 
back, then heaved the whole sheet into the trees. 

It opened as it fell to the ground. The two snakes slithered out instantly and 



pulled themselves to shelter under the trees. 

Jay and I let out loud sighs of relief. We stood there for a moment, hunched 
over, hands on our knees, trying to catch our breath. 

Crouching down, I looked for the snakes. But they had slithered deep into 
the safety of the evergreens. 

I stood up. I guess we should take back Mikes sheet, I said. 

He probably wont want to sleep on it, Jay said. But he reached down and 
pulled it up from the grass. He balled it up and tossed it to me. Its probably 
dripping with snake venom, he said, making a disgusted face. 

When we got back to the cabin, Colin had made his bed and was busily 
unpacking the contents of his trunk, shoving everything into the top dresser 
drawer. He turned as we entered. Howd it go? he asked casually. 

Horrible, Jay replied quickly, his expression grim. We both got bit. Twice. 

Youre a terrible liar! Colin told him, laughing. You shouldnt even try. 

Jay laughed, too. 

Colin turned to me. Youre a hero, he said. 

Thanks for all your help, Jay told him sarcastically. 

Colin started to reply. But the cabin door opened, and Larry poked his 
freckled face in. Hows it going? he asked. Youre not finished yet? 

We had a little problem, Jay told him. 

Wheres the fourth guy? The chubby one? Larry asked, lowering his head so 
he wouldnt bump it on the door frame as he stepped inside. 

Mike got bit. By a snake, I told him. 

There were two snakes in his bed, Jay added. 

Larrys expression didnt change. He didnt seem at all surprised. So where 
did Mike go? he asked casually, swatting a mosquito on his arm. 

His hand was bleeding. He went to the nurse to get it taken care of, I told 

him. 

Huh? Larrys mouth dropped open. 

He went to find the nurse, I repeated. 

Larry tossed back his head and started to laugh. Nurse? he cried, laughing 
hard. What nurse?! 



6 


The door opened and Mike returned, still holding his wounded hand. His face 
was pale, his expression frightened. They said there was no nurse, he told me. 

Then he saw Larry sitting on his bunk. Larrymy hand, Mike said. He held 
the hand out so the counselor could see it. It was stained with bright red blood. 

Larry stood up. I think I have some bandages, he told Mike. He pulled out a 
slender black case from beneath his bunk and began to search through it. 

Mike stood beside him, holding up his hand. Drops of blood splashed on 
the cabin floor. They said the camp doesnt have a nurse, Mike repeated. 

Larry shook his head. If you get hurt in this camp, he told Mike seriously, 
youre on your own. 

I think my hand is swelling a little, Mike said. 

Larry handed him a roll of bandages. The washroom is at the end of this 
row of cabins, he told Mike, closing the case and shoving it back under the bed. 
Go wash the hand and bandage it. Hurry. Its almost dinnertime. 

Holding the bandages tightly in his good hand, Mike hurried off to follow 
Larrys instructions. 

By the way, howd you guys get the snakes out of here? Larry asked, 
glancing around the cabin. 

We carried them out in Mikes sheet, Jay told him. He pointed at me. It was 
Billys idea. 

Larry stared hard at me. Hey, Im impressed, Billy, he said. That was pretty 
brave, man. 

Maybe I inherited something from my parents, I told him. Theyre scientists. 
Explorers, kind of. They go off for months at a time, exploring the wildest 
places. 

Well, Camp Nightmoon is pretty wild, Larry said. And you guys had better 
be careful. Im warning you. His expression turned serious. Theres no nurse at 
Camp Nightmoon. Uncle A1 doesnt believe in coddling you guys. 

The hot dogs were all charred black, but we were so hungry, we didnt care. I 
shoved three of them down in less than five minutes. I dont think Id ever been so 
hungry in all my life. 



The campfire was in a flat clearing surrounded by a circle of round white 
stones. Behind us, the large white-shingled lodge loomed over the sloping hill. 
Ahead of us a thick line of evergreen trees formed a fence that hid the river from 
view. 

Through a small gap in the trees, I could see a flickering campfire in the 
distance on the other side of the river. I wondered if that was the campfire of the 
girls camp. 

I thought about Dawn and Dori. I wondered if the two camps ever got 
together, if Id ever see them again. 

Dinner around the big campfire seemed to put everyone in a good mood. 
Jay was the only one sitting near me who complained about the hot dogs being 
burned. But I think he put away four or five of them anyway! 

Mike had trouble eating because of his bandaged hand. When he dropped 
his first hot dog, I thought he was going to burst into tears. By the end of dinner, 
he was in a much better mood. His wounded hand had swelled up just a little. 
But he said it didnt hurt as much as before. 

The counselors were easy to spot. They all wore their identical white shorts 
and green T-shirts. There were eight or ten of them, all young guys probably 
sixteen or seventeen. They ate together quietly, away from us campers. I kept 
looking at Larry, but he never once turned around to look at any of us. 

I was thinking about Larry, trying to figure out if he was shy or if he just 
didnt like us campers very much. Suddenly, Uncle A1 climbed to his feet and 
motioned with both hands for us all to be quiet. 

I want to welcome you boys to Camp Nightmoon, he began. I hope youre 
all unpacked and comfortable in your bunks. I know that most of you are first¬ 
time campers. 

He was speaking quickly, without any pauses between sentences, as if he 
was running through this for the thousandth time and wanted to get it over with. 

Id like to tell you some of our basic rules, he continued. First, lights-out is 
at nine sharp. 

A lot of guys groaned. 

You might think you can ignore this rule, Uncle A1 continued, paying no 
attention to their reaction. You might think you can sneak out of your cabins to 
meet or take a walk by the river. But Im warning you now that we dont allow it, 
and we have very good ways of making sure this rule is obeyed. 

He paused to clear his throat. 



Some boys were giggling about something. Across from me, Jay burped 
loudly, which caused more giggles. 

Uncle A1 didnt seem to hear any of this. On the other side of the river is the 
girls camp, he continued loudly, motioning to the trees. You might be able to see 
their campfire. Well, I want to make it clear that swimming or rowing over to the 
girls camp is strictly forbidden. 

Several boys groaned loudly. This made everyone laugh. Even some of the 
counselors laughed. Uncle A1 remained grim-faced. 

The woods around Camp Nightmoon are filled with grizzlies and tree bears, 
Uncle A1 continued. They come to the river to bathe and to drink. And theyre 
usually hungry. 

This caused another big reaction from all of us sitting around the fading 
campfire. Someone made a loud growling sound. Another kid screamed. Then 
everyone laughed. 

You wont be laughing if a bear claws your head off, Uncle A1 said sternly. 

He turned to the group of counselors outside our circle. Larry, Kurt, come 
over here, he ordered. 

The two counselors climbed obediently to their feet and made their way to 
the center of the circle beside Uncle Al. 

I want you two to demonstrate to the new campers the procedure to follow 
whener, I mean, z’/you are attacked by a grizzly bear. 

Immediately, the two counselors dropped to the ground on their stomachs. 
They lay flat and covered the backs of their heads with their hands. 

Thats right. I hope youre all paying close attention, the camp director 
thundered at us. 

Cover your neck and head. Try your best not to move. He motioned to the 
two counselors. Thanks, guys. You can get up. 

Have there ever been any bear attacks here? I called out, cupping my hands 
so Uncle Al could hear me. 

He turned in my direction. Two last summer, he replied. 

Several boys gasped. 

It wasnt pretty, Uncle Al continued. Its hard to remain still when a huge 
bear is pawing you and drooling all over you. But if you move His voice trailed 
off, leaving the rest to our imaginations, I guess. 

I felt a cold shiver run down my back. I didnt want to think about bears and 
bear attacks. 



What kind of camp did Mom and Dad send me to? I found myself 
wondering. I couldnt wait to call them and tell them about all that had happened 
already. 

Uncle A1 waited for everyone to quiet down, then pointed off to the side. 
Do you see that cabin over there? he asked. 

In the dim evening light, I could make out a cabin standing halfway up the 
hill toward the lodge. It appeared to be a little larger than the other cabins. It 
seemed to be built on a slant, sort of tipping on its side, as if the wind had tried 
to blow it over. 

I want you to make sure you see that cabin, Uncle A1 warned, his voice 
thundering out above the crackling of the purple fire. That is known as the 
Forbidden Bunk. We dont talk about that bunkand we dont go near it. 

I felt another cold shiver as I stared through the gray evening light at the 
shadowy, tilted cabin. I felt a sharp sting on the back of my neck and slapped a 
mosquito, too late to keep it from biting me. 

Im going to repeat what I just said, Uncle A1 shouted, still pointing to the 
dark cabin on the hill. That is known as the Forbidden Bunk. It has been closed 
and boarded up for many years. No one is to go near that cabin. No one. 

This started everyone talking and laughing. Nervous laughter, I think. 

Why is the Forbidden Bunk forbidden? someone called out. 

We never talk about it, Uncle A1 replied sharply. 

Jay leaned over and whispered in my ear, Lets go check it out. 

I laughed. Then I turned back to Jay uncertainly. Youre kiddingright? 

He grinned in reply and didnt say anything. 

I turned back toward the fire. Uncle A1 was wishing us all a good stay and 
saying how much he was looking forward to camp this year. And one more rule, 
he called out. You must write to your parents every day. Every day! We want 
them to know what a great time youre having at Camp Nightmoon. 

I saw Mike holding his wounded hand gingerly. Its starting to throb, he told 
me, sounding very frightened. 

Maybe Larry has something to put on it, I said. Lets go ask him. 

Uncle A1 dismissed us. We all climbed to our feet, stretching and yawning, 
and started to make our way in small groups back to the bunks. 

Mike and I lingered behind, hoping to talk to Larry. We saw him talking to 
the other counselors. He was at least a head taller than all of them. 

Hey, Larry! Mike called. 



But by the time we pushed our way through the groups of kids heading the 
other way, Larry had disappeared. 

Maybe hes going to our bunk to make sure we obey lights-out, I suggested. 

Lets go see, Mike replied anxiously. 

We walked quickly past the dying campfire. It had stopped crackling but 
still glowed a deep purple-red. Then we headed along the curve of the hill 
toward Bunk 4. 

My hand really hurts, Mike groaned, holding it tenderly in front of him. Im 
not just complaining. Its throbbing and its swelling up. And Im starting to have 
chills. 

Larry will know what to do, I replied, trying to sound reassuring. 

I hope so, Mike said shakily. 

We both stopped when we heard the howls. 

Hideous howls. Like an animal in pain. But too human to be from an 
animal. 

Long, shrill howls that cut through the air and echoed down the hill. 

Mike uttered a quiet gasp. He turned to me. Even in the darkness, I could 
see the fright on his face. 

Those cries, he whispered. Theyre coming from the Forbidden Bunk!

A few minutes later, Mike and I trudged into the cabin. Jay and Colin were 
sitting tensely on their beds. Wheres Larry? Mike asked, fear creeping into his 
voice. 

Not here, Colin replied. 

Where is he? Mike demanded shrilly. Ive got to find him. My hand! 

He should be here soon, Jay offered. 

I could still hear the strange howls through the open window. Do you hear 
that? I asked, walking over to the window and listening hard. 

Probably a prairie cat, Colin said. 

Prairie cats dont howl, Mike told him. Prairie cats screech, but they dont 
howl. 

How do you know? Colin asked, walking over to Larrys bunk and sitting 
down on the bottom bed. 

We studied them in school, Mike replied. 

Another howl made us all stop and listen. 

It sounds like a man, Jay offered, his eyes lighting up excitedly. A man 
whos been locked up in the Forbidden Bunk for years and years. 

Mike swallowed hard. Do you really think so? 

Jay and Colin laughed. 

What should I do about my hand? Mike asked, holding it up. It was 
definitely swollen. 

Go wash it again, I told him. And put a fresh bandage on it. I peered out the 
window into the darkness. Maybe Larry will show up soon. He probably knows 
where to get something to put on it. 

I cant believe theres no nurse, Mike whined. Why would my parents send 
me to a camp where theres no nurse or infirmary or anything? 

Uncle A1 doesnt like to coddle us, Colin said, repeating Larrys words. 

Jay stood up and broke into an imitation of Uncle Al. Stay away from the 
Forbidden Bunk! he cried in a booming deep voice. He sounded a lot like him. 
We dont talk about it and we dont ever go near it! 

We all laughed at Jays impression. Even Mike. 

We should go there tonight! Colin said enthusiastically. We should check it 



out immediately! 

We heard another long, sorrowful howl roll down the hill from the direction 
of the Forbidden Bunk. 

II dont think we should, Mike said softly, examining his hand. He started 
for the door. Im going to go wash this. The door slammed behind him. 

Hes scared, Jay scoffed. 

Im a little scared, too, I admitted. I mean, those awful howls 

Jay and Colin both laughed. Every camp has something like the Forbidden 
Bunk. The camp director makes it up, Colin said. 

Yeah, Jay agreed. Camp directors love scaring kids. Its the only fun they 
have. 

He puffed out his chest and imitated Uncle A1 again: Dont leave the bunk 
after lights-out or youll never be seen again! he thundered, then burst out 
laughing. 

Theres nothing in that Forbidden Bunk, Colin said, shaking his head. Its 
probably completely empty. Its all just a joke. You know. Like camp ghost 
stories. Every camp has its own ghost story. 

How do you know? I asked, dropping down onto Mikes bed. Have you ever 
been to camp before? 

No, Colin replied. But I have friends who told me about their camp. He 
reached up and pulled off his silver sunglasses for the first time. He had bright 
sky-blue eyes, like big blue marbles. 

We suddenly heard a bugle repeating a slow, sad-sounding tune. 

That must be the signal for lights-out, I said, yawning. I started to pull off 
my shoes. I was too tired to change or wash up. I planned to sleep in my clothes. 

Lets sneak out and explore the Forbidden Bunk, Jay urged. Come on. We 
can be the first ones to do it! 

I yawned again. Im really too tired, I told them. 

Me, too, Colin said. He turned to Jay. How about tomorrow night? 

Jays face fell in disappointment. 

Tomorrow, Colin insisted, kicking his shoes into the corner and starting to 
pull off his socks. 

I wouldnt do it if I were you! 

The voice startled all three of us. We turned to the window where Larrys 
head suddenly appeared from out of the darkness. He grinned in at us. Id listen 
to Uncle A1 if I were you, he said. 



How long had he been out there listening to us? I wondered. Was he 
deliberately spying on us? 

The door opened. Larry lowered his head as he loped in. His grin had faded. 
Unde A1 wasnt kidding around, he said seriously. 

Yeah. Sure, Colin replied sarcastically. He went over to his bed and slid 
beneath the wool blanket. 

I guess the camp ghost will get us if we go out after lights-out, Jay joked, 
tossing a towel across the room. 

No. No ghost, Larry said softly. But Sabre will. He pulled out his drawer 
and began searching for something inside it. 

Huh? Whos Sabre? I asked, suddenly wide-awake. 

Sabre is an it, Larry answered mysteriously. 

Sabre is a red-eyed monster who eats a camper every night, Colin sneered. 
He stared at me. There is no Sabre. Larrys just giving us another phony camp 
story. 

Larry stopped searching his drawer and gazed up at Colin. No, Im not, he 
insisted in a low voice. Im trying to save you guys some trouble. Im not trying to 
scare you. 

Then what is Sabre? I asked impatiently. 

Larry pulled a sweater from the drawer, then pushed the drawer shut. You 
dont want to find out, he replied. 

Come on. Tell us what it is, I begged. 

He isnt going to, Colin said. 

Ill tell you guys only one thing. Sabre will rip your heart out, Larry said 
flatly. 

Jay snickered. Yeah. Sure. 

Im serious! Larry snapped. Im not kidding, you guys! He pulled the sweater 
over his head. You dont believe me? Go out one night. Go out and meet Sabre. 
He struggled to get his arm into the sweater sleeve. But before you do, he 
warned, leave me a note with your address so Ill know where to send your stuff.

We had fun the next morning. 

We all woke up really early. The sun was just rising over the horizon to the 
south, and the air was still cool and damp. I could hear birds chirping. 

The sound reminded me of home. As I lowered myself to the floor and 
stretched, I thought of my mom and dad and wished I could call them and tell 
them about the camp. But it was only the second day. Id be too embarrassed to 
call them on the second day. 

I was definitely homesick. But luckily there wasnt any time to feel sad. 
After we pulled on fresh clothes, we hurried up to the lodge on the hill, which 
served as a meeting hall, theater, and mess hall. 

Long tables and benches were set up in straight rows in the center of the 
enormous room. The floorboards and walls were all dark redwood. Redwood 
ceiling beams crisscrossed high above our heads. There were very few windows, 
so it felt as if we were in an enormous dark cave. 

The clatter of dishes and cups and silverware was deafening. Our shouts 
and laughter rang off the high ceiling, echoed off the hardwood walls. Mike 
shouted something to me from across the table, but I couldnt hear him because 
of the racket. 

Some guys complained about the food, but I thought it was okay. We had 
scrambled egg squares, bacon strips, fried potatoes, and toast, with tall cups of 
juice. I never eat a breakfast that big at home. But I found that I was really 
starved, and I gobbled it up. 

After breakfast we lined up outside the lodge to form different activity 
groups. The sun had climbed high in the sky. It was going to be really hot. Our 
excited voices echoed off the sloping hill. We were all laughing and talking, 
feeling good. 

Larry and two other counselors, clipboards in hand, stood in front of us, 
shielding their eyes from the bright sun as they divided us into groups. The first 
group of about ten boys headed off to the river for a morning swim. 

Some people have all the luck, I thought. I was eager to get to the 
waterfront and see what the river was like. 

As I waited for my name to be called, I spotted a pay phone on the wall of 



the lodge. My parents flashed into my mind again. Maybe I will call them later, I 
decided. I was so eager to describe the camp to them and tell them about my new 
friends. 

Okay, guys. Follow me to the ball field, Larry instructed us. Were going to 
play our first game of scratchball. 

About twelve of us, including everyone from my bunk, followed Larry 
down the hill toward the flat grassy area that formed the playing field. 

I jogged to catch up to Larry, who always seemed to walk at top speed, 
stretching out his long legs as if he were in a terrible hurry. Are we going to 
swim after this? I asked. 

Without slowing his pace, he glanced at his clipboard. Yeah. I guess, he 
replied. You guysll need a swim. Were going to work up a sweat. 

You ever play scratchball before? Jay asked me as we hurried to keep up 
with Larry. 

Yeah. Sure, I replied. We play it a lot in school. 

Scratchball is an easy game to learn. The batter throws the ball in the air as 
high and as far as he can. Then he has to run the bases before someone on the 
other team catches the ball, tags him with it, or throws him out. 

Larry stopped at the far corner of the wide green field, where the bases and 
batters square had already been set up. He made us line up and divided us into 
two teams. 

He started calling out names. But when he called out Mikes name, Mike 
stepped up to Larry, holding his bandaged hand tenderly. II dont think I can play, 
Larry, Mike stammered. 

Come on, Mike. Dont whine, Larry snapped. 

But it really hurts, Mike insisted. Its throbbing like crazy, Larry. The pain is 
shooting all the way up and down my side. And lookhe raised the hand to Larrys 
faceits all swelled up! 

Larry pushed the arm away gently with his clipboard. Go sit in the shade, 
he told Mike. 

Shouldnt I get some medicine or something to put on it? Mike asked shrilly. 
I could see the poor guy was really in bad shape. 

Just sit over there, Larry ordered, pointing to a clump of short leafy trees at 
the edge of the field. Well talk about it later. 

Larry turned away from Mike and blew a whistle to start the game. Ill take 
Mikes place on the Blue team, he announced, jogging onto the field. 



I forgot about Mike as soon as the game got underway. We were having a 
lot of fun. Most of the guys were pretty good scratchball players, and we played 
much faster than my friends do back home at the playground. 

My first time up at the batters square, I heaved the ball really high. But it 
dropped right into a fielders hands, and I was out. My second time up, I made it 
to three bases before I was tagged out. 

Larry was a great player. When he came up to the batters square, he tossed 
the ball harder than I ever saw anyone toss it. It sailed over the fielders heads 
and, as they chased after it, Larry rounded all the bases, his long legs stretching 
out gracefully as he ran. 

By the fourth inning, our team, the Blue team, was ahead twelve to six. We 
had all played hard and were really hot and sweaty. I was looking forward to that 
swim at the waterfront. 

Colin was on the Red team. I noticed that he was the only player who wasnt 
enjoying the game. He had been tagged out twice, and hed missed an easy catch 
in the field. 

I realized that Colin wasnt very athletic. He had long, skinny arms without 
any muscles, and he also ran awkwardly. 

In the third inning Colin got into an argument with a player on my team 
about whether a toss had been foul or not. A few minutes later, Colin argued 
angrily with Larry about a ball that he claimed should have been out. 

He and Larry shouted at each other for a few minutes. It was no big deal, a 
typical sports argument. Larry finally ordered Colin to shut up and get back to 
the outfield. Colin grudgingly obeyed, and the game continued. 

I didnt think about it again. I mean, that kind of arguing happens all the 
time in ball games. And there are guys who enjoy the arguments as much as the 
game. 

But then, in the next inning, something strange happened that gave me a 
really bad feeling and made me stop and wonder just what was going on. 

Colins team came to bat. Colin stepped up to the batters square and 
prepared to toss the ball. 

Larry was playing the outfield. I was standing nearby, also in the field. 

Colin tossed the ball high but not very far. 

Larry and I both came running in to get it. 

Larry got there first. He picked up the small hard ball on the first bounce, 
drew back his armand then I saw his expression change. 



I saw his features tighten in anger. I saw his eyes narrow, his copper-colored 
eyebrows lower in concentration. 

With a loud grunt of effort, Larry heaved the ball as hard as he could. 

It struck Colin in the back of the head, making a loud crack sound as it hit. 

Colins silver sunglasses went flying in the air. 

Colin stopped short and uttered a short, high-pitched cry. His arms flew up 
as if hed been shot. Then his knees buckled. 

He collapsed in a heap, facedown on the grass. He didnt move. 

The ball rolled away over the grass. 

I cried out in shock. 

Then I saw Larrys expression change again. His eyes opened wide in 
disbelief. His mouth dropped open in horror. 

No! he cried. It slipped! I didnt mean to throw it at him! 

I knew Larry was lying. I had seen the anger on his face before he threw the 

ball. 

I sank down to my knees on the ground as Larry went running toward 
Colin. I felt dizzy and upset and confused. I had this sick feeling in my stomach. 

The ball slipped! Larry was yelling. It just slipped. 

Liar, I thought. Liar. Liar. Liar. 

I forced myself up on my feet and hurried to join the circle of guys around 
Colin. When I got there, Larry was kneeling over Colin, raising Colins head off 
the ground gently with both hands. 

Colins eyes were open wide. He stared up at Larry groggily and uttered low 
moans. 

Give him room, Larry was shouting. Give him room. He gazed down at 
Colin. The ball slipped. Im real sorry. The ball slipped. 

Colin moaned. His eyes rolled around in his head. Larry pulled off Colins 
red bandanna and mopped Colins forehead with it. 

Colin moaned again. His eyes closed. 

Help me carry him to the lodge, Larry instructed two guys from the Red 
team. The rest of you guys, get changed for your swim. The waterfront counselor 
will be waiting for you. 

I watched as Larry and the two guys hoisted Colin up and started to carry 
him toward the lodge. Larry gripped him under the shoulders. The two boys 
awkwardly took hold of his legs. 

The sick feeling in my stomach hadnt gone away. I kept picturing the 



intense expression of anger on Larrys face as he heaved the ball at the back of 
Colins head. 

I knew it had been deliberate. 

I started to follow them. I dont know why. I guess I was so upset, I wasnt 
thinking clearly. 

They were nearly to the bottom of the hill when I saw Mike catch up to 
them. He ran alongside Larry, holding his swollen hand. 

Can I come, too? Mike pleaded. Someone has to look at my hand. Its really 
bad, Larry. Pleasecan I come, too? 

Yeah. Youd better, I heard Larry reply curtly. 

Good, I thought. Finally someone was going to pay some attention to Mikes 
snakebite wound. 

Ignoring the sweat pouring down my forehead, I watched them make their 
way up the hill to the lodge. 

This shouldnt have happened, I thought, suddenly feeling a chill despite the 
hot sun. 

Something is wrong. Something is terribly wrong here. 

How was I to know that the horrors were just beginning?

Later that afternoon, Jay and I were writing our letters to our parents. I was 
feeling pretty upset about things. I kept seeing the angry expression on Larrys 
face as he heaved the ball at the back of Colins head. 

I wrote about it in my letter, and I also told my mom and dad about how 
there was no nurse here, and about the Forbidden Bunk. 

Jay stopped writing and looked at me from his bunk. He was really 
sunburned. His cheeks and forehead were bright red. 

He scratched his red hair. Were dropping like flies, he said, gesturing 
around the nearly empty cabin. 

Yeah, I agreed wistfully. I hope Colin and Mike are okay. And then I 
blurted out, Larry deliberately hit Colin. 

Huh? Jay stopped scratching his hair and lowered his hand to the bunk. He 
what ? 

He deliberately threw at Colins head. I saw him, I said, my voice shaky. I 
wasnt going to tell anyone, but now I was glad I did. It made me feel a little bit 
better to get it out. 

But then I saw that Jay didnt believe me. Thats impossible, he said quietly. 
Larrys our counselor. His hand slipped. Thats all. 

I started to argue when the cabin door opened and Colin entered, with Larry 
at his side. 

Colin! How are you? I cried. 

Jay and I both jumped down from our beds. 

Not bad, Colin replied. He forced a thin smile. I couldnt see his eyes. They 
were hidden once again behind his silver sunglasses. 

Hes still a little wobbly, but hes okay, Larry said cheerfully, holding Colins 

arm. 

Im sort of seeing double, Colin admitted. I mean, this cabin looks really 
crowded to me. There are two of each of you. 

Jay and I uttered short, uncomfortable laughs. 

Larry helped Colin over to his lower bunk. Hell be just fine in a day or two, 
Larry told us. 

Yeah. The headache is a little better already, Colin said, gently rubbing the 



back of his head, then lying down on top of the bedcovers. 

Did you see a doctor? I asked. 

Uh-uh. Just Uncle Al, Colin replied. He looked it over and said Id be fine. 

I cast a suspicious glance at Larry, but he turned his back on us and 
crouched down to search for something in the duffel bag he kept under his bed. 

Wheres Mike? Is he okay? Jay asked Larry. 

Uh-huh, Larry answered without turning around. Hes fine. 

But where is he? I demanded. 

Larry shrugged. Still at the lodge, I guess. I dont really know. 

But is he coming back? I insisted. 

Larry shoved the bag under his bed and stood up. Have you guys finished 
your letters? he asked. Hurry and get changed for dinner. You can mail your 
letters at the lodge. 

He started for the door. Hey, dont forget tonight is Tent Night. You guys are 
sleeping in a tent tonight. 

We all groaned. But, Larry, its too cold out! Jay protested. 

Larry ignored him and turned away. 

Hey, Larry, do you have anything I can put on this sunburn? Jay called after 

him. 

No, Larry replied, and disappeared out the door. 

Jay and I helped Colin up to the lodge. He was still seeing double, and his 
headache was pretty bad. The three of us sat at the end of the long table nearest 
the window. A strong breeze blew cool air over the table, which felt good on our 
sunburned skin. 

We had some kind of meat with potatoes and gravy for dinner. It wasnt 
great, but I was so hungry, it didnt matter. Colin didnt have much of an appetite. 
He picked at the edges of his gray meat. 

The mess hall was as noisy as ever. Kids were laughing and shouting to 
friends across the long tables. At one table, the guys were throwing breadsticks 
back and forth like javelins. 

As usual, the counselors, dressed in their green and white, ate together at a 
table in the far corner and ignored us campers completely. 

The rumor spread that we were going to learn all of the camp songs after 
dinner. Guys were groaning and complaining about that. 

About halfway through dinner, Jay and the boy across the table, a kid 



named Roger, started horsing around, trying to wrestle a breadstick from each 
other. Jay pulled hard and won the breadstickand spilled his entire cup of grape 
juice on my tan shorts. 

Hey! I jumped up angrily, staring down as the purple stain spread across the 
front of my shorts. 

Billy had an accident! Roger cried out. And everyone laughed. 

Yeah. He purpled in his pants! Jay added. 

Everyone thought that was hilarious. Someone threw a breadstick at me. It 
bounced off my chest and landed on my dinner plate. More laughter. 

The food fight lasted only a few minutes. Then two of the counselors broke 
it up. I decided Id better run back to the bunk and change my shorts. As I hurried 
out, I could hear Jay and Roger calling out jokes about me. 

I ran full speed down the hill toward the bunks. I wanted to get back up to 
the mess hall in time for dessert. 

Pushing open the bunk door with my shoulder, I darted across the small 
room to the dresser and pulled open my drawer. 

Huh? 

To my surprise, I stared into an empty drawer. It had been completely 
cleaned out. 

Whats going on here? I asked aloud. Wheres my stuff? 

Confused, I took a step backand realized I had opened the wrong drawer. 
This wasnt my drawer. 

It was Mikes. 

I stared for a long while into the empty drawer. 

Mikes clothes had all been removed. I turned and looked for his trunk, 
which had been stacked on its side behind our bunk. 

Mikes trunk was gone, too. 

Mike wasnt coming back. 


* * * 


I was so upset, I ran back to the mess hall without changing my shorts. 

Panting loudly, I made my way to the counselors table and came up behind 
Larry. He was talking to the counselor next to him, a fat guy with long, scraggly 
blond hair. LarryMikes gone! I cried breathlessly. 

Larry didnt turn around. He kept talking to the other counselor as if I 



werent there. 

I grabbed Larrys shoulder. Larrylisten! I cried. Mikehes gone! 

Larry turned around slowly, his expression annoyed. Go back to your table, 
Billy, he snapped. This table is for counselors only. 

But what about Mike? I insisted shrilly. His stuff is gone. What happened to 
him? Is he okay? 

How should I know? Larry replied impatiently. 

Did they send him home? I asked, refusing to back away until I had some 
kind of an answer. 

Yeah. Maybe. Larry shrugged and lowered his gaze. You spilled something 
on your shorts. 

My heart was pounding so hard, I could feel the blood pulsing at my 
temples. You really dont know what happened to Mike? I asked, feeling 
defeated. 

Larry shook his head. Im sure hes fine, he replied, turning back to his pals. 

He probably went for a swim, the scraggly haired guy next to him 
snickered. 

Larry and some of the other counselors laughed, too. 

I didnt think it was funny. I felt pretty sick. And a little frightened. 

Dont the counselors at this camp care what happens to us? I asked myself 
glumly. 

I made my way back to the table. They were passing out chocolate pudding 
for dessert, but I wasnt hungry. 

I told Colin and Jay and Roger about Mikes dresser drawer being cleaned 
out, and about how Larry pretended he didnt know anything about it. They didnt 
get as upset about it as I was. 

Uncle A1 probably had to send Mike home because of his hand, Colin said 
quietly, spooning up his pudding. It was pretty swollen. 

But why wouldnt Larry tell me the truth? I asked, my stomach still feeling 
as if I had eaten a giant rock for dinner. Why did he say he didnt know what 
happened to Mike? 

Counselors dont like to talk about bad stuff, Jay said, slapping the top of his 
pudding with his spoon. It might give us poor little kids nightmares. He filled his 
spoon with pudding, tilted it back, and flung a dark gob of pudding onto Rogers 
forehead. 

Jayyoure dead meat now! Roger cried, plunging his spoon into the 



chocolate goo. He shot a gob of it onto the front of Jays sleeveless T-shirt. 

That started a pudding war that spread down the long table. 

There was no more talk about Mike. 

After dinner, Uncle A1 talked about Tent Night and what a great time we 
were going to have sleeping in tents tonight. Just be very quiet so the bears cant 
find you! he joked. Some joke. 

Then he and the counselors taught us the camp songs. Uncle A1 made us 
sing them over and over until we learned them. 

I didnt feel much like singing. But Jay and Roger began making up really 
gross words to the songs. And pretty soon, a whole bunch of us joined in, 
singing our own versions of the songs as loudly as we could. 

Later, we were all making our way down the hill toward our tents. It was a 
cool, clear night. A wash of pale stars covered the purple-black sky. 

I helped Colin down the hill. He was still seeing double and feeling a little 
weak. 

Jay and Roger walked a few steps ahead of us, shoving each other with 
their shoulders, first to the left, then to the right. 

Suddenly, Jay turned back to Colin and me. Tonights the night, he 
whispered, a devilish grin spreading across his face. 

Huh? Tonights what night? I demanded. 

Ssshhh. He raised a finger to his lips. When everyones asleep, Roger and I 
are going to go check out the Forbidden Bunk. He turned to Colin. You with us? 

Colin shook his head sadly. I dont think I can, Jay. 

Walking backward in front of us, Jay locked his eyes on mine. How about 
you, Billy? You coming? 



10 


II think Ill stay with Colin, I told him. 

I heard Roger mutter something about me being a chicken. Jay looked 
disappointed. Youre going to miss out, he said. 

Thats okay. Im kind of tired, I said. It was true. I felt so weary after this 
long day, every muscle ached. Even my hair hurt! 

Jay and Roger made whispered plans all the way back to the tent. 

At the bottom of the hill, I stopped and gazed up at the Forbidden Bunk. It 
appeared to lean toward me in the pale starlight. I listened for the familiar howls 
that seemed to come from inside it. But tonight there was only a heavy silence. 

The large plastic tents were lined up in the bunk area. I crawled into ours 
and lay down on top of my sleeping bag. The ground was really hard. I could see 
this was going to be a long night. 

Jay and Colin were messing around with their sleeping bags at the back of 
the tent. It seems weird without Mike here, I said, feeling a sudden chill. 

Now youll have more room to put your stuff, Jay replied casually. He sat 
hunched against the tent wall, his expression tense, his eyes on the darkness 
outside the tent door, which was left open a few inches. 

Larry was nowhere in sight. Colin sat quietly. He still wasnt feeling right. 

I shifted my weight and stretched out, trying to find a comfortable position. 
I really wanted to go to sleep. But I knew I wouldnt be able to sleep until after 
Jay and Roger returned from their adventure. 

Time moved slowly. It was cold outside, and the air was heavy and wet 
inside the tent. 

I stared up at the dark plastic tent walls. A bug crawled across my forehead. 
I squashed it with my hand. 

I could hear Jay and Colin whispering behind me, but I couldnt make out 
their words. Jay snickered nervously. 

I must have dozed off. An insistent whispering sound woke me up. It took 
me a while to realize it was someone whispering outside the tent. 

I lifted my head and saw Rogers face peering in. I sat up, alert. 

Wish us luck, Jay whispered. 

Good luck, I whispered back, my voice clogged from sleep. 



In the darkness, I saw Jays large shadowy form crawl quickly to the tent 
door. He pushed it open, revealing a square of purple sky, then vanished into the 
darkness. 

I shivered. Lets sneak back to the bunk, I whispered to Colin. Its too cold 
out here. And the ground feels like solid rock. 

Colin agreed. We both scrambled out of the tent and made our way silently 
to our nice, warm bunk. Inside, we headed to the window to try to see Jay and 
Roger. 

Theyre going to get caught, I whispered. I just know it. 

They wont get caught, Colin disagreed. But they wont see anything, either. 
Theres nothing to see up there. Its just a stupid cabin. 

Poking my head out the window, I could hear Jay and Roger giggling 
quietly somewhere out in the dark. The camp was so silent, so eerily silent. I 
could hear their whispers, their legs brushing through the tall grass. 

Theyd better be quiet, Colin muttered, leaning against the window frame. 
Theyre making too much noise. 

They must be up to the hill by now, I whispered. I stuck my head out as far 
as I could, but I couldnt see them. 

Colin started to reply, but the first scream made him stop. 

It was a scream of horror that cut through the silent air. 

Oh! I cried out, and pulled my head in. 

Was that Jay or Roger? Colin asked, his voice trembling. 

The second scream was more terrifying than the first. 

Before it died down, I heard animal snarls. Loud and angry. Like an 
eruption of thunder. 

Then I heard Jays desperate plea: Help us! Pleasesomebody help us! 

My heart thudding in my chest, I lurched to the cabin door and pulled it 
open. The hideous screams still ringing in my ears, I plunged out into the 
darkness, the dew-covered ground soaking my bare feet. 

Jaywhere are you? I heard myself calling, but I didnt recognize my shrill, 
frightened voice. 

And then I saw a dark form running toward me, running bent over, arms 
outstretched. 

Jay! I cried. What/s it? What happened? 

He ran up to me, still bent forward, his face twisted in horror, his eyes wide 
and unblinking. His bushy hair appeared to stand straight up. 



Itit got Roger, he moaned, his chest heaving as he struggled to straighten 
up. 

What did? I demanded. 

What was it? Colin asked, right behind me. 

II dont know! Jay stammered, shutting his eyes tight. Itit tore Roger to 
pieces. 

Jay uttered a loud sob. Then he opened his eyes and spun around in terror. 
Here it comes! he shrieked. Now its coming after us! 



11 


In the pale starlight, I saw Jays eyes roll up in his head. His knees collapsed, and 
he began to slump to the ground. 

I grabbed him before he fell and dragged him into the cabin. Colin slammed 
the door behind us. 

Once inside, Jay recovered slowly. The three of us froze in place and 
listened hard. I was still holding on to Jays heaving shoulders. He was as pale as 
a bedsheet, and his breath came out in short, frightened moans. 

We listened. 

Silence. 

The air hung frozen and still. 

Nothing moved. 

No footsteps. No animal approaching. 

Just Jays frightened moans and the pounding of my heart. 

And then, somewhere far in the distance, I heard the howl. Soft and low at 
first, then rising on the wind. A howl that chilled my blood and made me cry out. 

Its Sabre! 

Dont let it get me! Jay shrieked, covering his face with his hands. He 
dropped to his knees on the cabin floor. Dont let it get me! 

I raised my eyes to Colin, who was huddled against the wall, away from the 
window. We have to get Larry, I managed to choke out. We have to get help. 

But how? Colin demanded in a trembling voice. 

Dont let it get me! Jay repeated, crumpled on the floor. 

It isnt coming here, I told him, trying to sound certain, trying to sound 
soothing. Were okay inside the bunk, Jay. It isnt coming here. 

But it got Roger and Jay started. His entire body convulsed in a shudder of 
terror. 

Thinking about Roger, I felt a stab of fear in my chest. 

Was it really true? Was it true that Roger had been attacked by some kind of 
creature? That hed been slashed to pieces? 

Id heard the screams from the hillside. Two bloodcurdling screams. 

Theyd been so loud, so horrifying. Hadnt anyone else in camp heard them, 



too? Hadnt any other kids heard Rogers cries? Hadnt any counselors heard? 

I froze in place and listened. 

Silence. The whisper of the breeze rustling the tree leaves. 

No voices. No cries of alarm. No hurried footsteps. 

I turned back toward the others. Colin had helped Jay to his bunk. Where 
can Larry be? Colin asked. His eyes, for once not hidden behind the silver 
sunglasses, showed real fear. 

Where can everyone be? I asked, crossing my arms over my chest and 
starting to pace back and forth in the small space between the beds. There isnt a 
sound out there. 

I saw Jays eyes go wide with horror. He was staring at the open window. 
The creature he cried. Here it comes! Its coming through the window! 



12 


All three of us gaped in horror at the open window. 

But no creature jumped in. 

As I stared, frozen in the center of the cabin, I could see only darkness and 
a fringe of pale stars. 

Outside in the trees, crickets started up a shrill clatter. There was no other 
sound. 

Poor Jay was so frightened and upset, he was seeing things. 

Somehow Colin and I got him a little calmed down. We made him take off 
his sneakers and lie down on his bed. And we covered him up with three 
blankets to help him to stop trembling. 

Colin and I wanted to run for help. But we were too frightened to go 
outside. 

The three of us were up all night. Larry never showed up. 

Except for the crickets and the brush of the wind through the trees, the 
camp was silent. 

I think I must have finally dozed off just before dawn. I had strange 
nightmares about fires and people trying to run away. 

I was awakened by Colin shaking me hard. Breakfast, he said hoarsely. 
Hurry. Were late. 

I sat up groggily. Wheres Larry? 

He never showed, Colin replied, motioning to Larrys unused bunk. 

Weve got to find him! Weve got to tell him what happened! Jay cried, 
hurrying to the cabin door with his sneakers untied. 

Colin and I stumbled after him, both of us only half awake. It was a cool, 
gray morning. The sun was trying hard to poke through high white clouds. 

The three of us stopped halfway up the hill to the mess hall. Reluctantly, 
our eyes searched the ground around the Forbidden Bunk. 

I dont know what I expected to see. But there was no sign of Roger. 

No sign of any struggle. No dried blood on the ground. The tall grass wasnt 
bent or matted down. 

Weird, I heard Jay mutter, shaking his head. Thats weird. 

I tugged his arm to get him moving, and we hurried the rest of the way up 



to the lodge. 

The mess hall was as noisy as ever. Kids were laughing and shouting to 
each other. It all seemed perfectly normal. I guessed that no one had made an 
announcement about Roger yet. 

Some kids called to Colin and me. But we ignored them and searched for 
Roger, moving quickly through the aisles between the tables. 

No sign of him. 

I had a heavy, queasy feeling in my stomach as we hurried to the counselors 
table in the corner. 

Larry glanced up from a big plate of scrambled eggs and bacon as the three 
of us advanced on him. 

What happened to Roger? 

Is he okay? 

Where were you last night? 

Roger and I were attacked. 

We were afraid to go find you. 

All three of us bombarded Larry at once. 

His face was filled with confusion, and he raised both hands to silence us. 
Whoa, he said. Take a breath, guys. What are you talking about? 

About Roger! Jay screamed, his face turning bright red. The creatureit 
jumped on him. Andand 

Larry glanced at the other counselors at the table, who looked as confused 
as he did. Creature? What creature? Larry demanded. 

It attacked Roger! Jay screamed. It was coming after me and 

Larry stared up at Jay. Someone was attacked? I dont think so, Jay. He 
turned to the counselor next to him, a pudgy boy named Derek. Did you hear 
anything in your area? 

Derek shook his head. 

Isnt Roger in your group? Larry asked Derek. 

Derek shook his head. Not in my group. 

But Roger Jay insisted. 

We didnt get any report about any attack, Larry said, interrupting. If a 
camper was attacked by a bear or something, wed hear about it. 

And wed hear the noise, Derek offered. You know. Screams or something. 

I heard screams, I told them. 

We both heard screams, Colin added quickly. And Jay came running back, 



crying for help. 

Well, why didnt anyone else hear it? Larry demanded, turning his gaze on 
Jay. His expression changed. Where did this happen? When? he asked 
suspiciously. 

Jays face darkened to a deeper red. After lights-out, he admitted. Roger and 
I went up to the Forbidden Bunk, and 

Are you sure it wasnt a bear? Derek interrupted. Some bears were spotted 
downriver yesterday afternoon. 

It was a creature! Jay screamed angrily. 

You shouldnt have been out, Larry said, shaking his head. 

Why wont you listen to me? Jay screamed. Roger was attacked. This big 
thing jumped on him and 

We would have heard something, Derek said calmly, glancing at Larry. 

Yeah, Larry agreed. The counselors were all up here at the lodge. We 
wouldve heard any screams. 

But, Larryyouve got to check it out! I cried. Jay isnt making it up. It really 
happened! 

Okay, okay, Larry replied, raising his hands as if surrendering. Ill go ask 
Uncle A1 about it, okay? 

Hurry, Jay insisted. Please! 

Ill ask Uncle A1 after breakfast, Larry said, turning back to his eggs and 
bacon. Ill see you guys at morning swim later. Ill report what Uncle A1 says. 

But, Larry Jay pleaded. 

Ill ask Uncle Al, Larry said firmly. If anything happened last night, hell 
know about it. He raised a strip of bacon to his mouth and chewed on it. I think 
you just had a bad nightmare or something, he continued, eyeing Jay 
suspiciously. But Ill let you know what Uncle Al says. 

It wasnt a nightmare! Jay cried shrilly. Larry turned his back on us and 
continued eating his breakfast. Dont you care? Jay screamed at him. Dont you 
care what happens to us? 

I saw that a lot of kids had stopped eating their breakfast to gawk at us. I 
pulled Jay away and tried to get him to go to our table. But he insisted on 
searching the entire mess hall again. I know Roger isnt here, he insisted. Hehe 
cant be! 

For the second time, the three of us made our way up and down the aisles 
between the tables, studying every face. 



One thing was for sure: Roger was nowhere to be seen. 


The sun burned through the high clouds just as we reached the waterfront for 
morning swim. The air was still cool. The thick, leafy shrubs along the riverbank 
glistened wetly in the white glare of sunlight. 

I dropped my towel under a bush and turned to the gently flowing green 
water. Ill bet its cold this morning, I said to Colin, who was retying the string on 
his swim trunks. 

I just want to go back to the bunk and go to sleep, Colin said, plucking at a 
knot. He wasnt seeing double any longer, but he was tired from being up all 
night. 

Several guys were already wading into the river. They were complaining 
about the cold water, splashing each other, shoving each other forward. 

Wheres Larry? Jay demanded breathlessly, pushing his way through the 
clump of shrubs to get to us. His red hair was a mess, half of it standing straight 
up on the side of his head. His eyes were red-rimmed and bloodshot. 

Wheres Larry? He promised hed be here, Jay said, frantically searching the 
waterfront. 

Here I am. The three of us spun around as Larry appeared from the bushes 
behind us. He was wearing baggy green Camp Nightmoon swim trunks. 

Well? Jay demanded. What did Uncle A1 say? About Roger? 

Larrys expression was serious. His eyes locked on Jays. Uncle A1 and I 
went all around the Forbidden Bunk, he told Jay. There wasnt any attack there. 
There couldnt have been. 

But itit got Roger, Jay cried shrilly. It slashed him. I saw it! 

Larry shook his head, his eyes still burning into Jays. Thats the other thing, 
he said softly. Uncle A1 and I went up to the office and checked the records, Jay. 
And there is no camper here this year named Roger. Not a first name or a middle 
name. No Roger. No Roger at all. 



13 


Jays mouth dropped open, and he uttered a low gasp. 

The three of us stared in disbelief at Larry, letting this startling news sink 
in. 

Someones made a mistake, Jay said finally, his voice trembling with 
emotion. We searched the mess hall for him, Larry. And hes gone. Roger isnt 
here. 

He never was here, Larry said without any emotion at all. 

II just dont believe this! Jay cried. 

How about a swim, guys? Larry said, motioning to the water. 

Well, what do you think? I demanded of Larry. I couldnt believe he was 
being so calm about this. What do you think happened last night? 

Larry shrugged. I dont know what to think, he replied, his eyes on the 
cluster of swimmers farthest from the shore. Maybe you guys are trying to pull a 
weird joke on me. 

Huh? Is that what you think? Jay cried. That its a joke?\ 

Larry shrugged again. Swim time, guys. Get some exercise, okay? 

Jay started to say more, but Larry quickly turned and went running into the 
green water. He took four or five running steps off the shore, then dived, pulling 
himself quickly through the water, taking long, steady strokes. 

Im not going in, Jay insisted angrily. Im going back to the bunk. His face 
was bright red. His chin was trembling. I could see that he was about to cry. He 
turned and began running through the bushes, dragging his towel along the 
ground. 

Hey, wait up! Colin went running after him. 

I stood there trying to decide what to do. I didnt want to follow Jay to the 
bunk. There wasnt anything I could do to help him. 

Maybe a cold swim will make me feel better, I thought. 

Maybe nothing will make me feel better, I told myself glumly. 

I stared out at the other guys in the water. Larry and another counselor were 
setting up a race. I could hear them discussing what kind of stroke should be 
used. 

They all seem to be having a great time, I thought, watching them line up. 



So why arent I? 

Why have I been so frightened and unhappy since I arrived here? Why dont 
the other campers see how weird and frightening this place is? 

I shook my head, unable to answer my questions. 

I need a swim, I decided. 

I took a step toward the water. 

But someone reached out from the bushes and grabbed me roughly from 
behind. 

I started to scream out in protest. 

But my attacker quickly clamped a hand over my mouth to silence me. 



14 


I tried to pull away, but Id been caught off guard. 

As the hands tugged me, I lost my balance and I was pulled back into the 
bushes. 

Is this a joke? Whats going on? I wondered. 

Suddenly, as I tried to tug myself free, the hands let go. 

I went sailing headfirst into a clump of fat green leaves. 

It took me a long moment to pull myself up. Then I spun around to face my 
attacker. 

Dawn! I cried. 

Ssshhhh! She leaped forward and clamped a hand over my mouth again. 
Duck down, she whispered urgently. Theyll see you. 

I obediently ducked behind the low bush. She let go of me again and moved 
back. She was wearing a blue one-piece bathing suit. It was wet. Her blond hair 
was also wet, dripping down onto her bare shoulders. 

Dawnwhat are you doing here? I whispered, settling onto my knees. 

Before Dawn could reply, another figure in a bathing suit moved quickly 
from the bushes, crouching low. It was Dawns friend Dori. 

We swam over. Early this morning, Dori whispered, nervously pushing at 
her curly red hair. We waited here. In the bushes. 

But its not allowed, I said, unable to hide my confusion. If youre caught 

We had to talk to you, Dawn interrupted, raising her head to peek over the 
top of the bushes, then quickly ducking back down. 

We decided to risk it, Dori added. 

Whatwhats wrong? I stammered. A red-and-black bug crawled up my 
shoulder. I brushed it away. 

The girls camp. Its a nightmare, Dori whispered. 

Everyone calls it Camp Nightmare instead of Camp Nightmoon, Dawn 
added. Strange things have been happening. 

Huh? I gaped at her. Not far from us in the water, I could hear the shouts 
and splashes of the swim race beginning. What kinds of strange things? 

Scary things, Dori replied, her expression solemn. 



Girls have disappeared, Dawn told me. Just vanished from sight. 

And no one seems to care, Dori added in a trembling whisper. 

I dont believe it! I uttered. The same thing has happened here. At the boys 
camp. I swallowed hard. Remember Mike? 

Both girls nodded. 

Mike disappeared, I told them. They removed his stuff, and he just 
disappeared. 

Its unbelievable, Dori said. Three girls are gone from our camp. 

They announced that one was attacked by a bear, Dawn whispered. 

What about the other two? I asked. 

Just gone, Dawn replied, the words catching in her throat. 

I could hear whistles blowing in the water. The race had ended. Another 
one was being organized. 

The sun disappeared once again behind high white clouds. Shadows 
lengthened and grew darker. 

I told them quickly about Roger and Jay and the attack at the Forbidden 
Bunk. They listened in openmouthed silence. Just like at our camp, Dawn said. 

We have to do something, Dori said heatedly. 

We have to get together. The boys and the girls, Dawn whispered, peering 
once again over the tops of the leaves. We have to make a plan. 

You mean to escape? I asked, not really understanding. 

The two girls nodded. We cant stay here, Dawn said grimly. Every day 
another girl disappears. And the counselors act as if nothing is happening. 

I think they want us to get killed or something, Dori added with emotion. 

Have you written to your parents? I asked. 

We write every day, Dori replied. But we havent heard from them. 

I suddenly realized that I hadnt received any mail from my parents, either. 
They had both promised to write every day. But I had been at camp for nearly a 
week, and I hadnt received a single piece of mail. 

Visitors Day is next week, I said. Our parents will be here. We can tell them 
everything. 

It may be too late, Dawn said grimly. 

Everyone is so scared! Dori declared. I havent slept in two nights. I hear 
these horrible screams outside every night. 

Another whistle blew, closer to shore. I could hear the swimmers returning. 
Morning swim was ending. 



II dont know what to say, I told them. Youve got to be careful. Dont get 
caught. 

Well swim back to the girls camp when everyone has left, Dawn said. But 
we have to meet again, Billy. We have to get more guys together. You know. 
Maybe if we all get organized Her voice trailed off. 

Theres something bad going on at this camp, Dori said with a shiver, 
narrowing her eyes. Something evil. 

II know, I agreed. I could hear boys voices now. Close by. Just on the other 
side of the leafy bushes. Ive got to go. 

Well try to meet here again the day after tomorrow, Dawn whispered. Be 
careful, Billy. 

You be careful, I whispered. Dont get caught. 

They slipped back, deeper in the bushes. 

Crouching low, I made my way away from the shore. When I was past the 
clump of bushes, I stood up and began to run. I couldnt wait to tell Colin and Jay 
about what the girls had said. 

I felt frightened and excited at the same time. I thought maybe it would 
make Jay feel a little better to know that the same kinds of horrible things were 
happening across the river at the girls camp. 

Halfway to the bunks, I had an idea. I stopped and turned toward the lodge. 

I suddenly remembered seeing a pay phone on the wall on the side of the 
building. Someone had told me that phone was the only one campers were 
allowed to use. 

III call Mom and Dad, I decided. 

Why hadnt I thought of it before? 

I can call my parents, I realized, and tell them everything. I can ask them to 
come and get me. And they could get Jay, Colin, Dawn, and Dori, too. 

Behind me, I saw my group heading toward the scratchball field, their 
swimming towels slung over their shoulders. I wondered if anyone had noticed 
that I was missing. 

Jay and Colin were missing, too, I told myself. Larry and the others 
probably think Im with them. 

I watched them trooping across the tall grass in twos and threes. Then I 
turned and started jogging up the hill toward the lodge. 

The idea of calling home had cheered me up already. 

I was so eager to hear my parents voices, so eager to tell them the strange 



things that were happening here. 

Would they believe me? 

Of course they would. My parents always believed me. Because they 
trusted me. 

As I ran up the hill, the dark pay phone came into view on the white lodge 
wall. I started to run at full speed. I wanted to fly to the phone. 

I hope Mom and Dad are home, I thought. 

Theyve got to be home. 

I was panting loudly as I reached the wall. I lowered my hands to my knees 
and crouched there for a moment, waiting to catch my breath. 

Then I reached up to take the receiver down. 

And gasped. 

The pay phone was plastic. Just a stage prop. 

A phony. 

It was a thin sheet of molded plastic held to the wall by a nail, made to look 
just like a telephone. 

It wasnt real. It was a fake. 

They dont want us to call out, I thought with a sudden chill. 

My heart thudding, my head spinning in bitter disappointment, I turned 
away from the walland bumped right into Uncle Al. 



15 


Billywhat are you doing up here? Unde A1 asked. He was wearing baggy green 
camp shorts and a sleeveless white T-shirt that revealed his meaty pink arms. He 
carried a brown clipboard filled with papers. Where are you supposed to be? 

I uh wanted to make a phone call, I stammered, taking a step back. I wanted 
to call my parents. 

He eyed me suspiciously and fingered his yellow mustache. Really? 

Yeah. Just to say hi, I told him. But the phone 

Uncle A1 followed my gaze to the plastic phone. He chuckled. Someone put 
that up as a joke, he said, grinning at me. Did it fool you? 

Yeah, I admitted, feeling my face grow hot. I raised my eyes to his. Where 
is the real phone? 

His grin faded. His expression turned serious. No phone, he replied sharply. 
Campers arent allowed to call out. Its a rule, Billy. 

Oh. I didnt know what to say. 

Are you really homesick? Uncle A1 asked softly. 

I nodded. 

Well, go write your mom and dad a long letter, he said. Itll make you feel a 
lot better. 

Okay, I said. I didnt think it would make me feel better. But I wanted to get 
away from Uncle Al. 

He raised his clipboard and gazed at it. Where are you supposed to be now? 
he asked. 

Scratchball, I think, I replied. I didnt feel too well, see. So I 

And when is your canoe trip? he asked, not listening to me. He flipped 
through the sheets of paper on the clipboard, glancing over them quickly. 

Canoe trip? I hadnt heard about any canoe trip. 

Tomorrow, he said, answering his own question. Your group goes 
tomorrow. Are you excited? He lowered his eyes to mine. 

II didnt really know about it, I confessed. 

Lots of fun! he exclaimed enthusiastically. The river doesnt look like much 
up here. But it gets pretty exciting a few miles down. Youll find yourself in some 
good rapids. 



He squeezed my shoulder briefly. Youll enjoy it, he said, grinning. 
Everyone always enjoys the canoe trip. 

Great, I said. I tried to sound a little excited, but my voice came out flat and 
uncertain. 

Uncle A1 gave me a wave with his clipboard and headed around toward the 
front of the lodge, taking long strides. I stood watching him till he disappeared 
around the corner of the building. Then I made my way down the hill to the 
bunk. 

I found Colin and Jay on the grass at the side of the cabin. Colin had his 
shirt off and was sprawled on his back, his hands behind his head. Jay sat cross- 
legged beside him, nervously pulling up long, slender strands of grass, then 
tossing them down. 

Come inside, I told them, glancing around to make sure no one else could 

hear. 

They followed me into the cabin. I closed the door. 

Whats up? Colin asked, dropping onto his bunk. He picked up his red 
bandanna and twisted it in his hands. 

I told them about Dawn and Dori and what they had reported about the girls 
camp. 

Colin and Jay both reacted with shock. 

They really swam over here and waited for you? Jay asked. 

I nodded. They think we have to get organized or escape or something, I 

said. 

They could get in big trouble if they get caught, Jay said thoughtfully. 

Were all in big trouble, I told him. We have to get out! 

Visitors Day is next week, Colin muttered. 

Im going to write my parents right now, I said, pulling out the case from 
under my bunk where I kept my paper and pens. Im going to tell them I have to 
come home on Visitors Day. 

I guess I will, too, Jay said, tapping his fingers nervously against the bunk 
frame. 

Me, too, Colin agreed. Its just too weird here! 

I pulled out a couple of sheets of paper and sat down on the bed to write. 
Dawn and Dori were really scared, I told them. 

So am I, Jay admitted. 

I started to write my letter. I wrote Dear Mom and Dad, HELP! then 



stopped. I raised my eyes across the cabin to Jay and Colin. Do you guys know 
about the canoe trip tomorrow? I asked. 

They stared back at me, their expressions surprised. 

Whoa! Colin declared. A three-mile hike this afternoon, and a canoe trip 
tomorrow? 

It was my turn to be surprised. Hike? What hike? 

Arent you coming on it? Jay asked. 

You know that really tall counselor? Frank? The one who wears the yellow 
cap? Colin asked. He told Jay and me were going on a three-mile hike after 
lunch. 

No one told me, I replied, chewing on the end of my pen. 

Maybe youre not in the hike group, Jay said. 

Youd better ask Frank at lunch, Colin suggested. Maybe he couldnt find 
you. Maybe youre supposed to come, too. 

I groaned. Who wants to go on a three-mile hike in this heat? 

Colin and Jay both shrugged. 

Frank said wed really like it, Colin told me, knotting and unknotting the red 
bandanna. 

I just want to get out of here, I said, returning to my letter. 

I wrote quickly, intensely. I wanted to tell my parents all the frightening, 
strange things that had happened. I wanted to make them see why I couldnt stay 
at Camp Nightmoon. 

I had written nearly a page and a half, and I was up to the part where Jay 
and Roger went out to explore the Forbidden Bunk, when Larry burst in. You 
guys taking the day off? he asked, his eyes going from one of us to the other. 
You on vacation or something? 

Just hanging out, Jay replied. 

I folded up my letter and started to tuck it under my pillow. I didnt want 
Larry to see it. I realized I didnt trust Larry at all. I had no reason to. 

What are you doing, Billy? he asked suspiciously, his eyes stopping on the 
letter I was shoving under the pillow. 

Just writing home, I replied softly. 

You homesick or something? he asked, a grin spreading across his face. 

Maybe, I muttered. 

Well, its lunchtime, guys, he announced. Lets hustle, okay? 

We all climbed out of our bunks. 



Jay and Colin are going on a hike with Frank this afternoon, I heard, Larry 
said. Lucky guys. He turned and started out the door. 

Larry! I called to him. Hey, Larrywhat about me? Am I supposed to go on 
the hike too? 

Not today, he called back. 

But why not? I said. 

But Larry disappeared out the door. 

I turned back to my two bunk mates. Lucky guys! I teased them. 

They both growled back at me in reply. Then we headed up the hill to 
lunch. 

They served pizza for lunch, which is usually my favorite. But today, the pizza 
was cold and tasted like cardboard, and the cheese stuck to the roof of my 
mouth. 

I wasnt really hungry. 

I kept thinking about Dawn and Dori, how frightened they were, how 
desperate. I wondered when Id see them again. I wondered if they would swim 
over and hide at the boys camp again before Visitors Day. 

After lunch, Frank came by our table to pick up Jay and Colin. I asked him 
if I was supposed to come, too. 

You werent on the list, Billy, he said, scratching at a mosquito bite on his 
neck. I can only take two at a time, you know? The trail gets a little dangerous. 

Dangerous? Jay asked, climbing up from the table. 

Frank grinned at him. Youre a big strong guy, he told Jay. Youll do okay. 

I watched Frank lead Colin and Jay out of the mess hall. Our table was 
empty now, except for a couple of blond-haired guys I didnt know who were arm 
wrestling down at the end near the wall. 

I pushed my tray away and stood up. I wanted to go back to the bunk and 
finish the letter to my parents. But as I took a few steps toward the door, I felt a 
hand on my shoulder. 

I turned to see Larry grinning down at me. Tennis tournament, he said. 

Huh? I reacted with surprise. 

Billy, youre representing Bunk Four in the tennis tournament, Larry said. 
Didnt you see the lineup? It was posted on the announcements board. 

But Im a terrible tennis player! I protested. 

Were counting on you, Larry replied. Get a racket and get your bod to the 



courts! 

I spent the afternoon playing tennis. I beat a little kid in straight sets. I had 
the feeling he had never held a tennis racket before. Then I lost a long, hard- 
fought match to one of the blond-haired boys whod been arm wrestling at lunch. 

I was drowning in sweat, and every muscle in my body ached when the 
match was over. I headed to the waterfront for a refreshing swim. 

Then I returned to the bunk, changed into jeans and a green-and-white 
Camp Nightmoon T-shirt, and finished my letter to my parents. 

It was nearly dinnertime. Jay and Colin werent back from their hike yet. I 
decided to go up to the lodge and mail my letter. As I headed up the hill, I saw 
clusters of kids hurrying to their bunks to change for dinner. But no sign of my 
two bunk mates. 

Holding the letter tightly, I headed around to the back of the lodge building, 
where the camp office was located. The door was wide open, so I walked in. A 
young woman was usually behind the counter to answer questions and to take 
the letters to be mailed. 

Anyone here? I called, leaning over the counter and peering into the tiny 
back room, which was dark. 

No reply. 

Hi. Anyone here? I repeated, clutching the envelope. 

No. The office was empty. 

Disappointed, I started to leave. Then I glimpsed the large burlap bag on the 
floor just inside the tiny back room. 

The mailbag! 

I decided to put my letter in the bag with the others to be mailed. I slipped 
around the counter and into the back room and crouched down to put my 
envelope into the bag. 

To my surprise, the mailbag was stuffed full with letters. As I pulled the bag 
open and started to shove my letter inside, a bunch of letters fell out onto the 
floor. 

I started to scoop them up when a letter caught my eye. 

It was one of mine. Addressed to my parents. 

One I had written yesterday. 

Weird, I muttered aloud. 

Bending over the bag, I reached in and pulled out a big handful of letters. I 
sifted through them quickly. I found a letter Colin had written. 



I pulled out another pile. 

And my eyes fell upon two other letters I had written nearly a week ago 
when I first arrived at camp. 

I stared at them, feeling a cold chill run down my back. 

All of our letters, all of the letters we had written since the first day of 
camp, were here. In this mailbag. 

None of them had been mailed. 

We couldnt call home. 

And we couldnt write home. 

Frantically, my hands trembling, I began shoving the envelopes back into 
the mailbag. 

What is going on here? I wondered. What is going on?

By the time I got into the mess hall, Uncle A1 was finishing the evening 
announcements. I slid into my seat, hoping I hadnt missed anything important. 

I expected to see Jay and Colin across the table from me. But their places 
on the bench were empty. 

Thats strange, I thought, still shaken from my discovery about the mailbag. 
They should be back by now. 

I wanted to tell them about the mail. I wanted to share the news that our 
parents werent getting any of the letters we wrote. 

And we werent getting any of theirs. 

The camp had to be keeping our mail from us, I suddenly realized. 

Colin and Jaywhere are you? 

The fried chicken was greasy, and the mashed potatoes were lumpy and 
tasted like paste. As I forced the food down, I kept turning to glance at the mess 
hall door, expecting to see my two bunk mates. 

But they didnt show up. 

A heavy feeling of dread formed in my stomach. Through the mess hall 
window, I could see that it was already dark outside. 

Where could they be? 

A three-mile hike and back shouldnt take this many hours. 

I pulled myself up and made my way to the counselors table in the corner. 
Larry was having a loud argument about sports with two of the other counselors. 
They were shouting and gesturing with their hands. 

Franks chair was empty. 

Larry, did Frank get back? I interrupted their discussion. 

Larry turned, a startled expression on his face. Frank? He motioned to the 
empty chair at the table. Guess not. 

He took Jay and Colin on the hike, I said. Shouldnt they be back by now? 

Larry shrugged. Beats me. He returned to his argument, leaving me 
standing there staring at Franks empty chair. 

After the trays had been cleared, we pushed the tables and benches against 
the wall and had indoor relay races. Everyone seemed to be having a great time. 
The shouts and cheers echoed off the high-raftered ceiling. 



I was too worried about Jay and Colin to enjoy the games. 

Maybe they decided to camp out overnight, I told myself. 

But I had seen them leave, and I knew they hadnt taken any tents or 
sleeping bags or other overnight supplies. 

So where were they? 

The games ended a little before lights-out. As I followed the crowd to the 
door, Larry appeared beside me. Were leaving early tomorrow, he said. First 
thing. 

Huh? I didnt understand what he meant. 

The canoe trip. Im the canoe counselor. Ill be taking you guys, he 
explained, seeing my confusion. 

Oh. Okay, I replied without enthusiasm. I was so worried about Jay and 
Colin, Id nearly forgotten about the canoe trip. 

Right after breakfast, Larry said. Wear a bathing suit. Bring a change of 
clothes. Meet me at the waterfront. He hurried back to help the other counselors 
pull the tables into place. 

After breakfast, I muttered. I wondered if Jay and Colin were also coming 
on the canoe trip. I had forgotten to ask Larry. 

I headed quickly down the dark hill. The dew had already fallen, and the 
tall grass was slippery and wet. Halfway down, I could see the dark outline of 
the Forbidden Bunk, hunched forward as if preparing to strike. 

Forcing myself to look away, I jogged the rest of the way to Bunk 4. 

To my surprise, I could see through the window that someone was moving 
around inside. 

Colin and Jay are back! I thought. 

Eagerly, I pushed open the door and burst inside. Heywhereve you guys 
been? I cried. 

I stopped short. And gasped. 

Two strangers stared back at me. 

One was sitting on the edge of Colins bunk, pulling off his sneakers. The 
other was leaning over the dresser, pulling a T-shirt from one of the drawers. 

Hi. You in here? the boy at the dresser stood up straight, his eyes studying 
me. He had very short black hair and a gold stud in one ear. 

I swallowed hard. Am I in the wrong bunk? Is this Bunk Four? 

They both stared at me, confused. 

I saw that the other boy, the one in Colins bunk, also had black hair, but his 



was long and scraggly and fell over his forehead. Yeah. This is Bunk Four, he 
said. 

Were new, the short-haired boy added. Im Tommy, and hes Chris. We just 
started today. 

Hi, I said uncertainly. My names Billy. My heart was pounding like a tom¬ 
tom in my chest. Wherere Colin and Jay? 

Who? Chris asked. They told us this bunk was mostly empty. 

Well, Colin and Jay I started. 

We just arrived. We dont know anyone, Tommy interrupted. He pushed the 
drawer shut. 

But thats Jays drawer, I said, bewildered, pointing. What did you do with 
Jays stuff? 

Tommy gazed back at me in surprise. The drawer was empty, he replied. 

Almost all the drawers were empty, Chris added, tossing his sneakers to the 
floor. Except for the bottom two drawers. 

Thats my stuff, I said, my head spinning. But Colin and Jaytheir stuff was 
here, I insisted. 

The whole cabin was empty, Tommy said. Maybe your friends got moved. 

Maybe, I said weakly. I sat down on the lower bunk beneath my bed. My 
legs felt shaky. A million thoughts were whirring through my mind, all of them 
frightening. 

This is weird, I said aloud. 

Its not a bad bunk, Chris said, pulling down his blanket and settling in. 
Kind of cozy. 

How long you staying at camp? Tommy asked, pulling on an oversized 
white T-shirt. All summer? 

No! I exclaimed with a shudder. Im not staying! I sputtered. I mean I mean 
Im leaving. On uh Im leaving on Visitors Day next week. 

Chris flashed Tommy a surprised glance. Huh? When are you leaving? he 
asked again. 

On Visitors Day, I repeated. When my parents come up for Visitors Day. 

But didnt you hear Uncle Als announcement before dinner? Tommy asked, 
staring hard at me. Visitors Day has been canceled! 



17 


I drifted in and out of a troubled sleep that night. Even with the blanket pulled up 
to my chin, I felt chilled and afraid. 

It felt so weird to have two strange guys in the bunk, sleeping where Jay 
and Colin had slept. I was worried about my missing friends. 

What had happened to them? Why hadnt they come back? 

As I tossed restlessly in my top bunk, I heard howls off in the distance. 
Animal cries, probably coming from the Forbidden Bunk. Long, frightening 
howls carried by the wind into our open bunk windows. 

At one point, I thought I heard kids screaming. I sat up straight, suddenly 
alert, and listened. 

Had I dreamed the frightful shrieks? I was so scared and confused, it was 
impossible to tell what was real and what was a nightmare. 

It took hours to fall back to sleep. 

I awoke to a gray, overcast morning, the air heavy and cold. Pulling on 
swim trunks and a T-shirt, I raced to the lodge to find Larry. I had to find out 
what had happened to Jay and Colin. 

I searched everywhere for him without success. Larry wasnt at breakfast. 
None of the other counselors admitted to knowing anything. Frank, the 
counselor who had taken my two friends on the hike, was also not there. 

I finally found Larry at the waterfront, preparing a long metal canoe for our 
river trip. Larrywhere are they? I cried out breathlessly. 

He gazed up at me, holding an armload of canoe paddles. His expression 
turned to bewilderment. Huh? Chris and Tommy? Theyll be here soon. 

No! I cried, grabbing his arm. Jay and Colin! Where are they? What 
happened to them, Larry? Youve got to tell me! 

I gripped his arm tightly. I was gasping for breath. I could feel the blood 
pulsing at my temples. Youve got to tell me! I repeated shrilly. 

He pulled away from me and let the paddles fall beside the canoe. I dont 
know anything about them, he replied quietly. 

But, Larry! 

Really, I dont, he insisted in the same quiet voice. His expression softened. 
He placed a hand on my trembling shoulder. Tell you what, Billy, he said, staring 



hard into my eyes. Ill ask Uncle A1 about it after our trip, okay? Ill find out for 
you. When we get back. 

I stared back at him, trying to decide if he was being honest. 

I couldnt tell. His eyes were as calm and cold as marbles. 

He leaned forward and pushed the canoe into the shallow river water. Here. 
Take one of those life preservers, he said, pointing to a pile of blue rubber vests 
behind me. Strap it on. Then get in. 

I did as he instructed. I saw that I had no choice. 

Chris and Tommy came running up to us a few seconds later. They 
obediently followed Larrys instructions and strapped on the life preserver vests. 

A few minutes later, the four of us were seated cross-legged inside the long, 
slender canoe, drifting slowly away from the shore. 

The sky was still charcoal gray, the sun hidden behind hovering dark 
clouds. The canoe bumped over the choppy river water. The current was stronger 
than I had realized. We began to pick up speed. The low trees and shrubs along 
the riverbank slid past rapidly. 

Larry sat facing us in the front of the canoe. He demonstrated how to 
paddle as the river carried us away. 

He watched carefully, a tight frown on his face, as the three of us struggled 
to pick up the rhythm he was showing us. Then, when we finally seemed to 
catch on, Larry grinned and carefully turned around, gripping the sides of the 
canoe as he shifted his position. 

The sun is trying to come out, he said, his voice muffled in the strong 
breeze over the rippling water. 

I glanced up. The sky looked darker than before. 

He stayed with his back to us, facing forward, allowing the three of us to do 
the paddling. I had never paddled a canoe before. It was harder than Id imagined. 
But as I fell into the rhythm of it with Tommy and Chris, I began to enjoy it. 

Dark water smacked against the prow of the canoe, sending up splashes of 
white froth. The current grew stronger, and we picked up speed. The air was still 
cold, but the steady work of rowing warmed me. After a while, I realized I was 
sweating. 

We rowed past tangles of yellow- and gray-trunked trees. The river 
suddenly divided in two, and we shifted our paddles to take the left branch. 
Larry began paddling again, working to keep us off the tall rocks that jutted 
between the river branches. 



The canoe bobbed up and slapped down. Bobbed up and slapped down. 
Cold water poured over the sides. 

The sky darkened even more. I wondered if it was about to storm. 

As the river widened, the current grew rapid and strong. I realized we didnt 
really need to paddle. The river was doing most of the work. 

The river sloped down. Wide swirls of frothing white water made the canoe 
leap and bounce. 

Here come the rapids! Larry shouted, cupping his hands around his mouth 
so we could hear him. Hang on! It gets pretty wild! 

I felt a tremor of fear as a wave of icy water splashed over me. The canoe 
rose up on a shelf of white water, then hit hard as it landed. 

I could hear Tommy and Chris laughing excitedly behind me. 

Another icy wave rolled over the canoe, startling me. I cried out and nearly 
let go of my paddle. 

Tommy and Chris laughed again. 

I took a deep breath and held on tightly to the paddle, struggling to keep up 
the rhythm. 

Hey, look! Larry cried suddenly. 

To my astonishment, he climbed to his feet. He leaned forward, pointing to 
the swirling white water. 

Look at those fish! 

As he leaned down, the canoe was jarred by a powerful rush of current. The 
canoe spun to the right. 

I saw the startled look on Larrys face as he lost his balance. His arms shot 
forward, and he plunged headfirst into the tossing waters. 

Noooooo! I screamed. 

I glanced back at Tommy and Chris, who had stopped paddling and were 
staring into the swirling murky waters, their expressions frozen in openmouthed 
horror. 

Larry! Larry! I was screaming the name over and over without realizing it. 

The canoe continued to slide rapidly down the churning waters. 

Larry didnt come up. 

Larry! 

Behind me, Tommy and Chris also called out his name, their voices shrill 
and frightened. 

Where was he? Why didnt he swim to the surface? 



The canoe was drifting farther and farther downriver. 

Larrrrrry! 

We have to stop! I screamed. We have to slow down! 

We cant! Chris shouted back. We dont know how! 

Still no sign of Larry. I realized he must be in trouble. 

Without thinking, I tossed my paddle into the river, climbed to my feet, and 
plunged into the murky swirling waters to save him. 



18 


I jumped without thinking and swallowed a mouthful of water as I went down. 

My heart thudded in my chest as I struggled frantically to the surface, 
sputtering and choking. 

Gasping in a deep breath, I lowered my head and tried to swim against the 
current. My sneakers felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds. 

I realized I should have pulled them off before I jumped. 

The water heaved and tossed. I moved my arms in long, desperate strokes, 
pulling myself toward the spot where Larry had fallen. Glancing back, I saw the 
canoe, a dark blur growing smaller and smaller. 

Wait! I wanted to shout to Tommy and Chris. Wait for me to get Larry! 

But I knew that they didnt know how to slow the canoe. They were helpless 
as the current carried them away. 

Where was Larry? 

I sucked in another mouthful of airand froze as I felt a sharp cramp in my 
right leg. 

The pain shot up through my entire right side. 

I slid under the water and waited for the pain to lessen. 

The cramp seemed to tighten until I could barely move my leg. Water 
rushed over me. I struggled to pull myself up to the surface. 

As I choked in more air, I stroked rapidly and hard, pulling myself up, 
ignoring the sharp pain in my leg. 

Hey! 

What was that object floating just ahead of me? A piece of driftwood being 
carried by the current? 

Murky water washed over me, blinding me, tossing me back. Sputtering, I 
pulled myself back up. 

Water rolled down my face. I struggled to see. 

Larry! 

He came floating right to me. 

Larry! Larry! I managed to scream. 

But he didnt answer me. I could see clearly now that he was floating 



facedown. 

The leg cramp started to loosen up as I reached out with both arms and 
grabbed Larrys shoulders. I pulled his head up from the water, rolled him onto 
his back, and wrapped my arm around his neck. I was using the lifesaving 
technique my parents had taught me. 

Turning downriver, I searched for the canoe. But the current had carried it 
out of sight. 

I swallowed another mouthful of icy water. Choking, I held on to Larry. I 
kicked hard. My right leg still felt tight and weak, but at least the pain had gone. 
Kicking and pulling with my free hand, I dragged Larry toward the shore. 

To my relief, the current helped. It seemed to pull in the same direction. 

A few seconds later, I was close enough to shore to stand. Wearily, panting 
like a wild animal, I tottered to my feet and dragged Larry onto the wet mud of 
the shore. 

Was he dead? Had he drowned before I reached him? 

I stretched him out on his back and, still panting loudly, struggling to catch 
my breath, to stop my entire body from trembling, I leaned over him. 

And he opened his eyes. 

He stared up at me blankly, as if he didnt recognize me. 

Finally, he whispered my name. Billy, he choked out, are we okay? 

Larry and I rested for a bit. Then we walked back to camp, following the river 
upstream. 

We were soaked clear through and drenched with mud, but I didnt care. We 
were alive. We were okay. I had saved Larrys life. 

We didnt talk much on the way back. It was taking every ounce of strength 
we had just to walk. 

I asked Larry if he thought Tommy and Chris would be okay. 

Hope so, he muttered, breathing hard. Theyll probably ride to shore and 
walk back like us. 

I took this opportunity to ask him again about Jay and Colin. I thought 
maybe Larry would tell me the truth since we were completely alone and since I 
had just saved his life. 

But he insisted he didnt know anything about my two bunk mates. As we 
walked, he raised one hand and swore he didnt know anything at all. 

So many frightening things have happened, I muttered. 



He nodded, keeping his eyes straight ahead. Its been strange, he agreed. 

I waited for him to say more. But he walked on in silence. 

It took three hours to walk back. We hadnt traveled downriver as far as I 
had thought, but the muddy shore kept twisting and turning, making our journey 
longer. 

As the camp came into view, my knees buckled and my legs nearly 
collapsed under me. 

Breathing hard, drenched in perspiration, our clothes still damp and covered 
in mud, we trudged wearily onto the waterfront. 

Hey! a voice called from the swim area. Uncle Al, dressed in baggy green 
sweats, came hurrying across the dirt to us. What happened? he asked Larry. 

We had an accident! I cried, before Larry had a chance to reply. 

I fell in, Larry admitted, his face reddening beneath the splattered mud. 
Billy jumped in and saved me. We walked back. 

But Tommy and Chris couldnt stop the canoe. They drifted away! I cried. 

We both nearly drowned, Larry told the frowning camp director. But 
Billyhe saved my life. 

Can you send someone to find Tommy and Chris? I asked, suddenly starting 
to shake all over, from exhaustion, I guess. 

The two boys floated on downriver? Uncle Al asked, staring hard at Larry, 
scratching the back of his fringe of yellow hair. 

Larry nodded. 

We have to find them! I insisted, trembling harder. 

Uncle Al continued to glare at Larry. What about my canoe? he demanded 
angrily. Thats our best canoe! How am I supposed to replace it? 

Larry shrugged unhappily. 

Well have to go look for that canoe tomorrow, Uncle Al snapped. 

He doesnt care about the two boys, I realized. He doesnt care about them at 
all. 

Go get into dry clothes, Uncle Al instructed Larry and me. He stormed off 
toward the lodge, shaking his head. 

I turned and started for the cabin, feeling chilled, my entire body still 
trembling. I could feel a strong wave of anger sweep over me. 

I had just saved Larrys life, but Uncle Al didnt care about that. 

And he didnt care that two campers were lost on the river. 

He didnt care that two campers and a counselor never returned from their 



hike. 


He didnt care that boys were attacked by creatures! 

He didnt care that kids disappeared and were never mentioned again. 

He didnt care about any of us. 

He only cared about his canoe. 

My anger quickly turned to fear. 

Of course, I had no way of knowing that the scariest part of my summer 
was still to come. 



19 


I was all alone in the bunk that night. 

I pulled an extra blanket onto my bed and slid into a tight ball beneath the 
covers. I wondered if Id be able to fall asleep. Or if my frightened, angry 
thoughts would keep me tossing and turning for another night. 

But I was so weary and exhausted, even the eerie, mournful howls from the 
Forbidden Bunk couldnt keep me awake. 

I fell into deep blackness and didnt wake up until I felt someone shaking 
my shoulders. 

Startled alert, I sat straight up. Larry! I cried, my voice still clogged with 
sleep. Whats happening? 

I squinted across the room. Larrys bed was rumpled, the blanket balled up 
at the end. He had obviously come in late and slept in the bunk. 

But Tommys and Chris beds were still untouched from the day before. 

Special hike, Larry said, walking over to his bunk. Hurry. Get dressed. 

Huh? I stretched and yawned. Outside the window, it was still gray. The sun 
hadnt risen. What kind of hike? 

Uncle A1 called a special hike, Larry replied, his back to me. He grabbed 
the sheet and started to make his bed. 

With a groan, I lowered myself to the cabin floor. It felt cold beneath my 
bare feet. Dont we get to rest? I mean, after what happened yesterday? I glanced 
once again at Tommys and Chris unused beds. 

Its not just us, Larry replied, smoothing the sheet. Its the whole camp. 
Everyones going. Uncle A1 is leading it. 

I pulled on a pair of jeans, stumbling across the cabin with one leg in. A 
sudden feeling of dread fell over me. It wasnt scheduled, I said darkly. Where is 
Uncle A1 taking us? 

Larry didnt reply. 

Where? I repeated shrilly. 

He pretended he didnt hear me. 

Tommy and Christhey didnt come back? I asked glumly, pulling on my 
sneakers. Luckily, I had brought two pairs. My shoes from yesterday sat in the 
corner, still soaked through and mud-covered. 



Theyll turn up, Larry replied finally. But he didnt sound as if he meant it. 

I finished getting dressed, then ran up the hill to get breakfast. It was a 
warm, gray morning. It must have rained during the night. The tall grass 
glistened wetly. 

Yawning and blinking against the harsh gray light, campers headed quietly 
up the hill. I saw that most of them had the same confused expression I had. 

Why were we going on this unscheduled hike so early in the morning? How 
long was it going to be? Where were we going? 

I hoped that Uncle A1 or one of the counselors would explain everything to 
us at breakfast, but none of them appeared in the mess hall. 

We ate quietly, without the usual joking around. 

I found myself thinking about the terrifying canoe trip yesterday. I could 
almost taste the brackish water again. I saw Larry coming toward me, facedown, 
floating on the churning water like a clump of seaweed. 

I pictured myself trying to get to him, struggling to swim, struggling to go 
against the current, to keep afloat in the swirls of white water. 

And I saw a blur of the canoe as the strong river current carried it out of 
sight. 

Suddenly, Dawn and Dori burst into my thoughts. I wondered if they were 
okay. I wondered if they were going to try to meet me again by the waterfront. 

Breakfast was French toast with syrup. It was usually my favorite. But this 
morning, I just poked at it with my fork. 

Line up outside! a counselor cried from the doorway. 

Chairs scraped loudly. We all obediently climbed to our feet and began 
making our way outside. 

Where are they taking us ? 

Why doesnt anyone tell us what this is about? 

The sky had brightened to pink, but the sun still hadnt risen over the 
horizon. 

We formed a single line along the side wall of the lodge. I was near the end 
of the line toward the bottom of the hill. 

Some kids were cracking jokes and playfully shoving each other. But most 
were standing quietly or leaning against the wall, waiting to see what was going 
to happen. 

Once the line was formed, one of the counselors walked the length of it, 
pointing his finger and moving his lips in concentration as he counted us. He 



counted us twice to make sure he had the right number. 

Then Uncle A1 appeared at the front of the line. He wore a brown-and-green 
camouflage outfit, the kind soldiers wear. He had on very black sunglasses, even 
though the sun wasnt up yet. 

He didnt say a word. He signaled to Larry and another counselor, who were 
both carrying very large, heavy-looking brown bags over their shoulders. Then 
Uncle A1 strode quickly down the hill, his eyes hidden behind the dark glasses, 
his features set in a tight frown. 

He stopped in front of the last camper. This way! he announced loudly, 
pointing toward the waterfront. 

Those were his only words. This way! 

And we began to follow, walking at a pretty fast clip. Our sneakers slid 
against the wet grass. A few kids were giggling about something behind me. 

To my surprise, I realized I was now nearly at the front of the line. I was 
close enough to call out to Uncle Al. So I did. Where are we going? I shouted. 

He quickened his pace and didnt reply. 

Uncle Alis this a long hike? I called. 

He pretended he hadnt heard. 

I decided to give up. 

He led us toward the waterfront, then turned right. Thick clumps of trees 
stood a short way up ahead where the river narrowed. 

Glancing back to the end of the line, I saw Larry and the other counselor, 
bags on their shoulders, hurrying to catch up to Uncle Al. 

What is this about? I wondered. 

And as I stared at the clumps of low, tangled trees up ahead, a thought 
pushed its way into my head. 

I can escape. 

The thought was so frighteningbut suddenly so realit took a long time to 
form. 

I can escape into these trees. 

I can run away from Uncle Al and this frightening camp. 

The idea was so exciting, I nearly stumbled over my own feet. I bumped 
into the kid ahead of me, a big bruiser of a guy named Tyler, and he turned and 
glared at me. 

Whoa, I told myself, feeling my heart start to pound in my chest. Think 
about this. Think carefully. 



I kept my eyes locked on the woods. As we drew closer, I could see that the 
thick trees, so close together that their branches were all intertwined, seemed to 
stretch on forever. 

Theyd never find me in there, I told myself. It would be really easy to hide 
in those woods. 

But then what? 

I couldnt stay in the woods forever. 

Then what? 

Staring at the trees, I forced myself to concentrate, forced myself to think 
clearly. 

I could follow the river. Yes. Stay on the shore. 

Follow the river. It was bound to come to a town eventually. It had to come 
to a town. 

Id walk to the first town. Then Id call my parents. 

I can do it, I thought, so excited I could barely stay in line. 

I just have to run. Make a dash for it. When no one is looking. Into the 
woods. Deep into the woods. 

We were at the edge of the trees now. The sun had pulled itself up, 
brightening the rose-colored morning sky. We stood in the shadows of the trees. 

I can do it, I told myself. 

Soon. 

My heart thudded loudly. I was sweating even though the air was still cool. 

Calm down, Billy, I warned myself. Just calm down. 

Wait for your chance. 

Wait till the time is right. 

Then leave Camp Nightmare behind. Forever. 

Standing in the shade, I studied the trees. I spotted a narrow path into the 
woods a few yards up head. 

I tried to calculate how long it would take me to reach the path. Probably 
ten seconds at most. And then in another five seconds, I could be into the 
protection of the trees. 

I can do it, I thought. 

I can be gone in less than ten seconds. 

I took a deep breath. I braced myself. I tensed my leg muscles, preparing to 

mn. 

Then I glanced to the front of the line. 



To my horror, Unde A1 was staring directly at me. And he held a rifle in his 
hands. 



20 


I cried out when I saw the rifle in his hands. 

Had he read my thoughts? Did he know I was about to make a run for it? 

A cold chill slid down my back as I gaped at the rifle. As I raised my eyes 
to Uncle Als face, I realized he wasnt looking at me. 

He had turned his attention to the two counselors. They had lowered the 
bags to the ground and were bending over them, trying to get them open. 

Why did we stop? Tyler, the kid ahead of me, asked. 

Is the hike over? another kid joked. A few kids laughed. 

Guess we can go back now, another kid said. 

I stood watching in disbelief as Larry and the other counselor began 
unloading rifles from the two bags. 

Line up and get one, Uncle A1 instructed us, tapping the handle of his own 
rifle against the ground. One rifle per boy. Come onhurry! 

No one moved. I think everyone thought Uncle A1 was kidding or 
something. 

Whats wrong with you boys? I said hurry! he snapped angrily. He grabbed 
up an armload of rifles and began moving down the line, pushing one into each 
boys hands. 

He pushed a rifle against my chest so hard, I staggered back a few steps. I 
grabbed it by the barrel before it fell to the ground. 

Whats going on? Tyler asked me. 

I shrugged, studying the rifle with horror. Id never held any kind of real gun 
before. My parents were both opposed to firearms of all kinds. 

A few minutes later, we were all lined up in the shadow of the trees, each 
holding a rifle. Uncle A1 stood near the middle of the line and motioned us into a 
tight circle so we could hear him. 

Whats going on? Is this target practice? one boy asked. 

Larry and the other counselor snickered at that. Uncle Als features 
remained hard and serious. 

Listen up, he barked. No more jokes. This is serious business. 

The circle of campers tightened around him. We grew silent. A bird 
squawked noisily in a nearby tree. Somehow it reminded me of my plan to 



escape. 

Was I about to be really sorry that I hadnt made a run for it? 

Two girls escaped from the girls camp last night, Uncle A1 announced in a 
flat, businesslike tone. A blonde and a redhead. 

Dawn and Dori! I exclaimed to myself. Ill bet it was them! 

I believe, Uncle A1 continued, that these are the same two girls who 
sneaked over to the boys camp and hid near the waterfront a few days ago. 

Yes! I thought happily. It is Dawn and Dori! They escaped! 

I suddenly realized a broad smile had broken out on my face. I quickly 
forced it away before Uncle A1 could see my happy reaction to the news. 

The two girls are in these woods, boys. Theyre nearby, Uncle A1 continued. 
He raised his rifle. Your guns are loaded. Aim carefully when you see them. 
They wont get away from us! 



21 


Huh? I gasped in disbelief. You mean were supposed to shoot them? 

I glanced around the circle of campers. They all looked as dazed and 
confused as I did. 

Yeah. Youre supposed to shoot them, Uncle A1 replied coldly. I told 
youtheyre trying to escape. 

But we cant! I cried. 

Its easy, Uncle A1 said. He raised his rifle to his shoulder and pretended to 
fire it. See? Nothing to it. 

But we cant kill people! I insisted. 

Kill? His expression changed behind the dark glasses. I didnt say anything 
about killing, did I? These guns are loaded with tranquilizer darts. We just want 
to stop these girlsnot hurt them. 

Uncle A1 took two steps toward me, the rifle still in his hands. He stood 
over me menacingly, lowering his face close to mine. 

You got a problem with that, Billy? he demanded. 

He was challenging me. 

I saw the other boys back away. 

The woods grew silent. Even the bird stopped squawking. 

You got a problem with that? Uncle A1 repeated, his face so close to mine, I 
could smell his sour breath. 

Terrified, I took a step back, then another. 

Why was he doing this to me? Why was he challenging me like this? 

I took a deep breath and held it. Then I screamed as loudly as I could: II 
wont do it! 

Without completely realizing what I was doing, I raised the rifle to my 
shoulder and aimed the barrel at Uncle Als chest. 

Youre gonna be sorry, Uncle A1 growled in a low voice. He tore off the 
sunglasses and heaved them into the woods. Then he narrowed his eyes furiously 
at me. Drop the rifle, Billy. Im gonna make you sorry. 

No, I told him, standing my ground. Youre not. Camp is over. Youre not 
going to do anything. 

My legs were trembling so hard, I could barely stand. 



But I wasnt going to go hunting Dawn and Dori. I wasnt going to do 
anything else Uncle A1 said. Ever. 

Give me the rifle, Billy, he said in his low, menacing voice. He reached out 
a hand toward my gun. Hand it over, boy. 

No! I cried. 

Hand it over now, he ordered, his eyes narrowed, burning into mine. Now! 
No! I cried. 

He blinked once. Twice. 

Then he leaped at me. 

I took a step back with the rifle aimed at Uncle Aland pulled the trigger. 



22 


The rifle emitted a soft pop. 

Uncle A1 tossed his head back and laughed. He let his rifle drop to the 
ground at his feet. 

Hey! I cried out, confused. I kept the rifle aimed at his chest. 

Congratulations, Billy, Uncle A1 said, grinning warmly at me. You passed. 
He stepped forward and reached out his hand to shake mine. 

The other campers dropped their rifles. Glancing at them, I saw that they 
were all grinning, too. Larry, also grinning, flashed me a thumbs-up sign. 

Whats going on? I demanded suspiciously. I slowly lowered the rifle. 

Uncle A1 grabbed my hand and squeezed it hard. Congratulations, Billy. I 
knew youd pass. 

Huh? I dont understand! I screamed, totally frustrated. 

But instead of explaining anything to me, Uncle A1 turned to the trees and 
shouted, Okay, everyone! Its over! He passed! Come out and congratulate him! 

And as I stared in disbelief, my wide-open mouth hanging down around my 
knees, people began stepping out from behind the trees. 

First came Dawn and Dori. 

You were hiding in the woods! I cried. 

They laughed in response. Congratulations! Dawn cried. 

And then others came out, grinning and congratulating me. I screamed 
when I recognized Mike. He was okay! 

Beside him were Jay and Roger! 

Colin stepped out of the woods, followed by Tommy and Chris. All smiling 
and happy and okay. 

Whatwhats going on here? I stammered. I was totally stunned. I felt dizzy. 

I didnt get it. I really didnt get it. 

And then my mom and dad stepped out from the trees. Mom rushed up and 
gave me a hug. Dad patted the top of my head. I knew youd pass, Billy, he said. I 
could see happy tears in his eyes. 

Finally, I couldnt take it anymore. I pushed Mom gently away. Passed 
what! ? I demanded. What is this? Whats going on? 



Uncle A1 put his arm around my shoulders and guided me away from the 
group of campers. Mom and Dad followed close behind. 

This isnt really a summer camp, Uncle A1 explained, still grinning at me, 
his face bright pink. Its a government testing lab. 

Huh? I swallowed hard. 

You know your parents are scientists, Billy, Uncle A1 continued. Well, 
theyre about to leave on a very important expedition. And this time they wanted 
to take you along with them. 

How come you didnt tell me? I asked my parents. 

We couldnt! Mom exclaimed. 

According to government rules, Billy, Uncle A1 continued, children arent 
allowed to go on official expeditions unless they pass certain tests. Thats what 
youve been doing here. Youve been taking tests. 

Tests to see what? I demanded, still dazed. 

Well, we wanted to see if you could obey orders, Uncle A1 explained. You 
passed when you refused to go to the Forbidden Bunk. He held up two fingers. 
Second, we had to test your bravery. You demonstrated that by rescuing Larry. 
He held up a third finger. Third, we had to see if you knew when not to follow 
orders. You passed that test by refusing to hunt for Dawn and Dori. 

And everyone was in on it? I asked. All the campers? The counselors? 
Everyone? They were all actors? 

Uncle A1 nodded. They all work here at the testing lab. His expression 
turned serious. You see, Billy, your parents want to take you to a very dangerous 
place, perhaps the most dangerous place in the known universe. So we had to 
make sure you can handle it. 

The most dangerous place in the universe? 

Where? I asked my parents. Where are you taking me? 

Its a very strange planet called Earth, Dad replied, glancing at Mom. Its 
very far from here. But it could be exciting. The inhabitants there are weird and 
unpredictable, and no one has ever studied them. 

Laughing, I stepped between my mom and dad and put my arms around 
them. Earth?! It sounds pretty weird. But it could never be as dangerous or 
exciting as Camp Nightmoon! I exclaimed. 

Well see, Mom replied quietly. Well see. 



THE GHOST  NEXT DOOR 
Goosebumps - 10 
R.L. Stine 



1 


Hannah wasn’t sure which had awakened her—the brittle crackling sounds or the 
bright yellow flames. 

She sat straight up in bed and stared in wide-eyed horror at the fire that 
surrounded her. 

Flames rippled across her dresser. The burning wallpaper curled and then 
melted. The door of her closet had burned away, and she could see the fire 
leaping from shelf to shelf. 

Even the mirror was on fire. Hannah could see her reflection, dark behind 
the wall of flickering flames. 

The fire moved quickly to fill the room. 

Hannah began to choke on the thick, sour smoke. 

It was too late to scream. 

But she screamed anyway. 


* * * 


How nice to find out it was only a dream. 

Hannah sat up in bed, her heart pounding, her mouth as dry as cotton. 

No crackling flames. No leaping swirls of yellow and orange. 

No choking smoke. 

All a dream, a horrible dream. So real. 

But a dream. 

“Wow. That was really scary,” Hannah muttered to herself. She sank back 
on her pillow and waited for her heart to stop thudding so hard in her chest. She 
raised her gray-blue eyes to the ceiling, staring at the cool whiteness of it. 

Hannah could still picture the black, charred ceiling, the curling wallpaper, 
the flames tossing in front of the mirror. 

“At least my dreams aren’t boring!” she told herself. Kicking off the light 
blanket, she glanced at her desk clock. Only eight-fifteen. 

How can it only be eight-fifteen? she wondered. I feel as if I’ve been 
sleeping forever. What day is it, anyway? 



It was hard to keep track of these summer days. One seemed to melt into 
another. 

Hannah was having a lonely summer. Most of her friends had gone away on 
family vacations or to camp. 

There was so little for a twelve-year-old to do in a small town like 
Greenwood Falls. She read a lot of books and watched a lot of TV and rode her 
bike around town, looking for someone to hang out with. 

Boring. 

But today Hannah climbed out of bed with a smile on her face. 

She was alive! 

Her house hadn’t burned down. She hadn’t been trapped inside the 
crackling wall of flames. 

Hannah pulled on a pair of Day-Glo green shorts and a bright orange 
sleeveless top. Her parents were always teasing her about being color blind. 

“Give me a break! What’s the big deal if I like bright colors?” she always 
replied. 

Bright colors. Like the flames around her bed. 

“Hey, dream—get /ost!” she muttered. She ran a hairbrush quickly through 
her short blonde hair, then headed down the hall to the kitchen. She could smell 
the eggs and bacon frying on the stove. 

“Good morning, everyone!” Hannah chirped happily. 

She was even happy to see Bill and Herb, her six-year-old twin brothers. 

Pests. The noisiest nuisances in Greenwood Falls. 

They were tossing a blue rubber ball across the breakfast table. “How many 
times do I have to tell you—no ball-playing in the house?” Mrs. Fairchild called, 
turning away from the stove to scold them. 

“A million,” Bill said. 

Herb laughed. He thought Bill was hilarious. They both thought they were a 

riot. 

Hannah stepped behind her mother and wrapped her up in a tight hug 
around the waist. 

“Hannah—stop!” her mother cried. “I nearly knocked over the eggs!” 

“Hannah — stop! Hannah — stop!” The twins imitated their mother. 

The ball bounced off Herb’s plate, rebounded off the wall, and flew onto the 
stove, inches from the frying pan. 

“Nice shot, ace,” Hannah teased. 



The twins laughed their high-pitched laughs. 

Mrs. Fairchild spun around, frowning. “If the ball goes in the frying pan, 
you’re going to eat it with your eggs!” she threatened, shaking her fork at them. 

This made the boys laugh even harder. 

“They’re in goofy moods today,” Hannah said, smiling. She had a dimple in 
one cheek when she smiled. 

“When are they ever in serious moods?” her mother demanded, tossing the 
ball into the hallway. 

“Well, I’m in a great mood today!” Hannah declared, gazing out the 
window at a cloudless, blue sky. 

Her mother stared at her suspiciously. “How come?” 

Hannah shrugged. “I just am.” She didn’t feel like telling her mother about 
the nightmare, about how good it felt just to be alive. “Where’s Dad?” 

“Went to work early,” Mrs. Fairchild said, turning the bacon with the fork. 
“Some of us don’t get the entire summer off,” she added. “What are you going to 
do today, Hannah?” 

Hannah opened the refrigerator and pulled out a carton of orange juice. 
“The usual, I guess. You know. Just hang out.” 

“I’m sorry you’re having such a boring summer,” her mother said, sighing. 
“We just didn’t have the money to send you to camp. Maybe next summer—” 

“That’s okay, Mom,” Hannah replied brightly. “I’m having an okay 
summer. Really.” She turned to the twins. “How’d you guys like those ghost 
stories last night?” 

“Not scary,” Herb quickly replied. 

“Not scary at all. Your ghost stories are dumb,” Bill added. 

“You guys looked pretty scared to me,” Hannah insisted. 

“We were pretending,” Herb said. 

She held up the orange juice carton. “Want some?” 

“Does it have pulp in it?” Herb asked. 

Hannah pretended to read the carton. “Yes. It says ‘one hundred percent 
pulp’.” 

“I hate pulp!” Herb declared. 

“Me, too!” Bill agreed, making a face. 

It wasn’t the first time they’d had a breakfast discussion about pulp. 

“Can’t you buy orange juice without pulp?” Bill asked their mother. 

“Can you strain it for us?” Herb asked Hannah. 



“Can I have apple juice instead?” Bill asked. 

“I don’t want juice. I want milk,” Herb decided. 

Normally, this discussion would have made Hannah scream. But today, she 
reacted calmly. “One apple juice and one milk coming up,” she said cheerfully. 

“You certainly are in a good mood this morning,” her mother commented. 

Hannah handed Bill his apple juice, and he promptly spilled it. 

After breakfast, Hannah helped her mother clean up the kitchen. “Nice day,” 
Mrs. Fairchild said, peering out the window. “Not a cloud in the sky. It’s 
supposed to go up to ninety.” 

Hannah laughed. Her mother was always giving weather reports. “Maybe 
I’ll go for a long bike ride before it gets really hot,” she told her mother. 

She stepped out the back door and took a deep breath. The warm air 
smelled sweet and fresh. She watched two yellow-and-red butterflies fluttering 
side by side over the flower garden. 

She took a few steps across the grass toward the garage. From somewhere 
down the block she could hear the low drone of a power mower. 

Hannah gazed up at the clear blue sky. The sun felt warm on her face. 

“Hey —look out!” an alarmed voice cried. 

Hannah felt a sharp pain in her back. 

She uttered a frightened gasp as she fell to the ground. 



2 


Hannah landed hard on her elbows and knees. She turned quickly to see what 
had hit her. 

A boy on a bike. “Sorry!” he called. He jumped off the bike and let it fall to 
the grass. “I didn’t see you.” 

I’m wearing Day-Glo green and orange, Hannah thought. Why couldn’t he 
see me? 

She climbed to her feet and rubbed the grass stains on her knees. “Ow,” she 
muttered, frowning at him. 

“I tried to stop,” he said quietly. 

Hannah saw that he had bright red hair, almost as orange as candy corn, 
brown eyes, and a face full of freckles. 

“Why were you riding in my yard?” Hannah demanded. 

“Your yard?” He narrowed his dark eyes at her. “Since when?” 

“Since before I was born,” Hannah replied sharply. 

He pulled a leaf from her hair. “You live in that house?” he asked, pointing. 

Hannah nodded. “Where do you live?” Hannah demanded. She examined 
her elbows. They were dirty, but not bruised. 

“Next door,” he said, turning toward the redwood ranch-style house across 
the driveway. 

“Huh?” Hannah reacted with surprise. “You can’t live there!” 

“Why not?” he demanded. 

“That house is empty,” she told him, studying his face. “It’s been empty 
ever since the Dodsons moved away.” 

“It’s not empty now,” he said. “I live there. With my mom.” 

How can that be? Hannah wondered. How could someone move in right 
next door without my knowing it? 

I was playing with the twins back here yesterday, she thought, gazing hard 
at the boy. I’m sure that house was dark and empty. 

“What’s your name?” she asked. 

“Danny. Danny Anderson.” 

She told him her name. “I guess we’re neighbors,” she said. “I’m twelve. 



How about you?” 

“Me, too.” He bent to examine his bike. Then he pulled out a tuft of grass 
that had gotten caught in the spokes of the back wheel. “How come Tve never 
seen you before?” he asked suspiciously. 

“How come Tve never seen you? she replied. 

He shrugged. His eyes crinkled in the corners as a shy smile crossed his 

face. 

“Well, did you just move in?” Hannah asked, trying to get to the bottom of 
the mystery. 

“Huh-uh,” he replied, concentrating on the bike. 

“No? How long have you lived here?” Hannah asked. 

“Awhile.” 

That’s impossible! Hannah thought. There’s no way he could have moved 
in next door without me knowing it! 

But before she could react, she heard a high-pitched voice calling her from 
the house. “Hannah! Hannah! Herb won’t give back my Gameboy!” Bill stood 
on the back stoop, leaning against the open screen door. 

“Where’s Mom?” Hannah shouted back. “She’ll get it for you.” 

“Okay.” 

The screen door slammed hard as Bill went to find Mrs. Fairchild. 

Hannah turned back to talk to Danny, but he had vanished into thin air.

The mail usually came a little before noon. Hannah rushed eagerly down to the 
bottom of the drive and pulled open the mailbox lid. 

No mail for her. No mail at all. 

Disappointed, she hurried back to her room to write a scolding letter to her 
best friend, Janey Pace. 

Dear Janey, 

I hope you ’re having a good time at camp. But not too good—because you 
broke your promise. You said that you’d write to me every day, and so far, I 
haven’t even received a crummy POSTCARD. 

I am so BORED I don’t know what to do! You can’t imagine how little there 
is to do in Greenwood Falls when no one is around. It’s really like DEATH! 

I watch TV and I read a lot. Do you believe I’ve already read ALL the books 
on our summer reading list? Dad promised to take us all camping in Miller 
Woods—BIG THRILL—but he’s been working just about every weekend, so I 
don’t think he will. 

BORING! 

Last night I was so bored, I marched the twins outside and built a little 
campfire behind the garage and pretended we were away at camp and told them 
a bunch of scary ghost stories. 

The boys wouldn’t admit it, of course, but I could see they enjoyed it. But 
you know how ghost stories freak me out. I started seeing weird shadows and 
things moving behind the trees. It was really kind of hilarious, I guess. I totally 
scared MYSELF. 

Don’t laugh, Janey. You don’t like ghost stories, either. 

My only other news is that a new boy moved into the Dodsons ’ old house 
next door. His name is Danny and he’s our age, and he has red hair and freckles, 
and he’s kind of cute, I think. 

I’ve only seen him once. Maybe I’ll have more to report about him later. 

But now it’s YOUR TURN to write. Come on, Janey. You promised. Have 
you met any cute guys at camp? Is THAT why you’re too busy to write to me? 

If I don’t hear from you, I hope you get poison ivy all over your body — 



especially in places where you can’t scratch! 

Love, 

Hannah 

Hannah folded the letter and stuffed it into an envelope. Her small desk 
stood in front of the bedroom window. Leaning over the desk, she could see the 
house next door. 

I wonder if that’s Danny’s room? she thought, peering into the window just 
across the driveway. Curtains were pulled over the window, blocking her view. 

Hannah pulled herself to her feet. She ran a hairbrush through her hair, then 
carried the letter to the front door. 

She could hear her mother scolding the twins somewhere in the back of the 
house. The boys were giggling as Mrs. Fairchild yelled at them. Hannah heard a 
loud crash. Then more giggling. 

“I’m going out!” she shouted, pushing open the screen door. 

They probably didn’t hear her, she realized. 

It was a hot afternoon, no breeze at all, the air heavy and wet. Hannah’s 
father had mowed the front lawn the day before. The freshly cut grass smelled 
sweet as Hannah made her way down the driveway. 

She glanced over to Danny’s house. No signs of life there. The front door 
was closed. The big living room picture window appeared bare and dark. 

Hannah decided to walk the three blocks to town and mail the letter at the 
post office. She sighed. Nothing else to do, she thought glumly. At least a walk 
to town will kill some time. 

The sidewalk was covered with cut blades of grass, the green fading to 
brown. Humming to herself, Hannah passed Mrs. Quilty’s redbrick house. Mrs. 
Quilty was bent over her garden, pulling up weeds. 

“Hi, Mrs. Quilty. How are you?” Hannah called. 

Mrs. Quilty didn’t look up. 

What a snob! Hannah thought angrily. I know she heard me. 

Hannah crossed the street. The sound of a piano floated from the house on 
the corner. Someone was practicing a piece of classical music, playing the same 
wrong note over and over, then starting the piece again. 

I’m glad they’re not my neighbors, Hannah thought, smiling. 

She walked the rest of the way to town, humming to herself. 

The two-story white post office stood across the tiny town square, its flag 



drooping on the pole in the windless sky. Around the square stood a bank, a 
barbershop, a small grocery, and a gas station. A few other stores, Harder’s Ice- 
Cream Parlor, and a diner called Diner stretched behind the square. 

Two women were walking out of the grocery. Through the barbershop 
window, Hannah could see Ernie, the barber, sitting in the chair, reading a 
magazine. 

Real lively scene, she thought, shaking her head. 

Hannah crossed the small, grassy square and dropped her letter in the 
mailbox in front of the post office door. She turned back toward home—but 
stopped when she heard the angry shouts. 

The shouts were coming from behind the post office, Hannah realized. A 
man was screaming. 

Hannah heard boys’ voices. More yelling. 

She began jogging around the side of the building, toward the angry voices. 

She was nearly to the alley when she heard the shrill yelp of pain. 



4 


“Hey—!” Hannah called out and ran the rest of the way. “What’s going on?” 

A narrow alley stretched behind the post office. It was a hidden place where 
kids liked to hang out. 

Hannah saw Mr. Chesney, the postmaster. He was shaking a fist angrily at a 
wiry brown mutt. 

There were three boys in the alley. Hannah recognized Danny. He was 
hanging behind the two boys she didn’t recognize. 

The dog had its head lowered and was whimpering softly. A tall boy, thin 
and lanky with scraggly blond hair, grabbed the dog gently and bent down to 
comfort it. 

“Don’t throw stones at my dog!” the boy shouted at Mr. Chesney. 

The other boy stepped forward. He was a short, stubby kid, kind of tough¬ 
looking, with spiky black hair. He glared at Mr. Chesney, his hands balled into 
fists at his sides. 

Danny lingered away from the others, very pale, his eyes narrowed tensely. 

“Get away! Go! I warned you!” Mr. Chesney snarled. He was a thin, red¬ 
faced man, entirely bald, with a bushy brown mustache under his pointed nose. 
He wore a tight-fitting gray wool suit, despite the summer heat. 

“You don’t have the right to hurt my dog!” the blond boy insisted, still 
cradling the mutt. The dog’s stubby tail was wagging furiously now. The dog 
licked the boy’s hand. 

“This is government property,” the postmaster replied sharply. “I’m 
warning you—get away from here. This isn’t a hangout for you troublemakers.” 
He took a menacing step toward the three boys. 

Hannah saw Danny take a few steps back, his expression frightened. The 
other two boys stood their ground, staring at the red-faced postmaster defiantly. 
They were big, Hannah saw. Bigger than Danny. They appeared to be older than 
Danny. 

“I’m telling my dad you hurt Rusty,” the blond boy said. 

“Tell your dad you were trespassing,” Mr. Chesney shot back. “And tell him 
you were rude and disrespectful. And tell him I’ll file a complaint against all 
three of you punks if I catch you back here again.” 



“We’re not punks!” the heavier boy shouted angrily. 

Then all three boys turned and started running down the alley. The dog 
zigzagged excitedly at their heels, its stubby tail twitching wildly. 

Mr. Chesney stormed past Hannah, muttering curses to himself. He was so 
angry, he pushed right past her as he made his way to the front of the post office. 

What a jerk, Hannah thought, shaking her head. What is his problem, 
anyway? 

All of the kids in Greenwood Falls hated Mr. Chesney. Mainly because he 
hated kids. He was always shouting at them to stop loitering in the square, or 
stop playing such loud music, or stop talking so loudly, or stop laughing so 
much, or to get out of his precious alley. 

He acts as if he owns the whole town, Hannah thought. 

At Halloween, Hannah and a bunch of friends had decided to go to Mr. 
Chesney’s house and spray-paint his windows. But to their disappointment, 
Chesney was prepared for any Halloween trick-players. He stood at the ready in 
his front window, an enormous shotgun in his hand. 

Hannah and her friends had gone on their way, disappointed and scared. 

He knows how much we all hate him, Hannah realized. 

And he doesn’t care. 

The alley was quiet now. Hannah headed back toward the town square, 
thinking about Danny. He had looked so frightened, so pale. So pale, he nearly 
seemed to fade away in the bright sunlight. 

Danny’s two friends didn’t seem frightened at all, Hannah thought. They 
seemed angry and tough. Or maybe they were just acting tough because Mr. 
Chesney was being so horrible to the blond boy’s dog. 

Crossing the square, Hannah searched for signs of life. In his brightly lit 
shop, Ernie was still sitting in the barber chair, his face buried in a magazine. A 
blue station wagon had pulled into the gas station. A woman Hannah didn’t 
recognize was hurrying to get to the bank before it closed. 

No sign of Danny and his two friends. 

I guess I’ll go home and catch General Hospital, Hannah thought with a 
sigh. She crossed the street and made her way slowly toward home. 

Tall trees, maples and birches and sassafras, lined the sidewalk. The leaves 
were so thick, they nearly blocked the sunlight. 

It was cooler under their shade, Hannah realized as she walked under them. 

She was halfway down the block when the dark figure slid out from behind 



a tree. 

At first Hannah thought it was just the shadow cast by the wide trunk. But 
then, as her eyes adjusted to the shade, the figure became clear. 

Hannah gasped and stopped walking. 

She stared hard, squinting at him, struggling to bring him into focus. 

He stood in a deep blue puddle of shadow. Dressed in black, he was tall and 
slender, his face completely hidden in darkness. 

Hannah felt a cold shiver of fear roll down her body. 

Who is he? she wondered. Why is he dressed like that? 

Why is he standing so still, keeping in the shadows, staring back at me from 
the dark shade? 

Is he trying to scare me? 

He slowly raised a hand, motioning for her to come nearer. 

Her heart fluttering in her chest, Hannah took a step back. 

Is there really someone there? 

A figure dressed in black? 

Or am I seeing shadows cast by the trees? 

She wasn’t sure—until she heard the whisper: 

“Hannah... Hannah...” 

The whisper was as dry as the brush of tree leaves, and nearly as soft. 
“Hannah... Hannah...” 

A slender black shadow, motioning to her with arms as bony as twigs, 
whispering to her. Such a dry, inhuman whisper. 

“No!” Hannah cried. 

She spun around and struggled to run. Her legs felt weak. Her knees didn’t 
want to bend. 

But she forced herself to run. Faster. 

Faster. 

Was he following her? 



5 


Panting loudly, Hannah crossed the street without stopping to look for traffic. 
Her sneakers pounded against the sidewalk as she ran. 

One more block to go. 

Is he following? 

The shadows shifted and bent as she ran under the trees. Shadows on top of 
shadows, sliding over each other, gray on black, blue on gray. 

“Hannah... Hannah...” The dry whisper. 

Dry as death. 

Calling to her from the shifting shadows. 

He knows my name, she thought, gulping for breath, forcing her legs to 
keep moving. 

And then she stopped. 

And spun around. 

“Who are you?” she shouted breathlessly. “What do you want? 

But he had vanished. 

There was silence now. Except for Hannah’s hard breathing. 

Hannah stared into the tangle of late afternoon shadows. Her eyes darted 
over the shrubs and hedges of the yards on her block. She searched the spaces 
between the houses, the darkness behind an open garage door, the slanting gray 
square beside a small shed. 

Gone. Vanished. 

No sign of the black-enshrouded figure that had whispered her name. 

“Whoa—!” she uttered out loud. 

It was an optical illusion, she decided, her eyes still warily studying the 
front lawns. 

No way. 

She argued with herself. An optical illusion doesn’t call your name. 

There’s nothing there, Hannah, she assured herself. Her breathing returned 
to normal. Nothing there. 

You’re making up more ghost stories. You’re scaring yourself again. 

You’re bored and lonely, and so you’re letting your imagination run away 



with you. 

Feeling only a little better, Hannah jogged the rest of the way home. 

Later, at dinner, she decided not to mention the shadow figure to her parents. 
They would never believe it anyway. 

Instead, Hannah told them about the new family who had moved next door. 
“Huh? Someone moved into the Dodsons’ house?” Mr. Fairchild set down 
his fork and knife and stared across the table at Hannah from behind his square¬ 
framed horn-rimmed glasses. 

“There’s a boy my age,” Hannah reported. “His name is Danny. He has 
bright orange hair and freckles.” 

“That’s nice,” Mrs. Fairchild replied distractedly, motioning for the twins to 
stop shoving each other and eat their dinners. 

Hannah wasn’t even sure her mother had heard her. 

“How did they move in without us seeing them?” Hannah asked her father. 
“Did you see a moving truck or anything?” 

“Huh-uh,” Mr. Fairchild muttered, picking up his silverware and returning 
to his roast chicken. 

“Well, don’t you think it’s weird?” Hannah demanded. 

But before either parent could reply, Herb’s chair toppled over backwards. 
His head hit the linoleum, and he began to howl. 

Her mom and dad leapt off their chairs and bent to help him. 

“I didn’t push him!” Bill screamed shrilly. “Really. I didn’t!” 

Frustrated that her parents weren’t interested in her big news, Hannah 
carried her plate to the kitchen. Then she wandered into her bedroom. 

Making her way to her desk, she pushed aside the curtains and peered out 
the window. 

Danny, are you in there? she wondered, staring at the curtains that covered 
his dark window. What are you doing right now? 

The summer days seemed to float by. Hannah could barely remember how she 
passed the time. If only some of my friends were around, she thought wistfully. 

If only one of my friends was around! 

If only one of my friends would write. 

Such a lonely summer... 

She looked for Danny, but he never seemed to be around. When she finally 



saw him in his back yard one late afternoon, she hurried over to talk to him. 
“Hi!” she cried enthusiastically. 

He was tossing a tennis ball against the back of the house and catching it. 
The ball made a loud thock each time it hit the redwood wall. 

“Hi!” Hannah called again, jogging across the grass. 

Danny turned, startled. “Oh. Hi. How’s it going?” He turned back to the 
house and tossed the ball. 

He was wearing a blue T-shirt over baggy black-and-yellow-striped shorts. 
Hannah stepped up beside him. 

Thock. The ball hit the wall just below the gutter and bounced into Danny’s 
hand. 

“I haven’t seen you around,” Hannah said awkwardly. 

“Uh-huh,” was his brief reply. 

Thock. 

“I saw you behind the post office,” she blurted out. 

“Huh?” He spun the ball in his hand, but didn’t throw it. 

“A few days ago, I saw you in the alley. With those two guys. Mr. Chesney 
is a real jerk, isn’t he?” Hannah said. 

Danny snickered. “When he yells, his whole head turns bright red. Just like 
a tomato.” 

“A rotten tomato,” Hannah added. 

“What’s his problem, anyway?” Danny asked, tossing the ball. Thock. “My 
friends and I—we weren’t doing anything. Just hanging out.” 

“He thinks he’s a big shot,” Hannah replied. “He’s always bragging how 
he’s a federal employee.” 

“Yeah.” 

“What are you doing this summer?” she asked. “Just hanging around like 

me?” 

“Kind of,” he said. Thock. He missed the ball and had to chase it to the 
garage. 

As he walked back toward the house, he gazed at her, as if seeing her for 
the first time. Hannah suddenly felt self-conscious. She was wearing a yellow 
top with grape jelly stains on the front, and her rattiest blue cotton shorts. 

“Those two guys, Alan and Fred—they’re the guys I usually hang out 
with,” he told her. “Guys from school.” 

Thock. 



How could he have friends from school? Hannah wondered. Didn’t he just 
move here? 

“Where do you go to school?” she asked, dodging out of the way as he 
backed up to catch the ball. 

“Maple Avenue Middle School,” he replied. 

Thock. 

“Hey—that’s where I go!” Hannah exclaimed. 

How come I’ve never seen him there? she wondered. 

“Do you know Alan Miller?” Danny asked, turning to her, shading his eyes 
with one hand from the late afternoon sun. 

Hannah shook her head. “No.” 

“Fred Drake?” he asked. 

“No,” she replied. “What grade are you in?” 

“I’ll be in eighth this year,” he said, turning back to the wall. 

Thock. 

“Me, too!” Hannah declared. “Do you know Janey Pace?” 

“No.” 

“How about Josh Goodman?” Hannah asked. 

Danny shook his head. “Don’t know him.” 

“Weird,” Hannah said, thinking out loud. 

Danny threw the tennis ball a little too hard, and it landed on the sloping 
gray-shingled roof. They both watched it hit, then roll down into the gutter. 
Danny sighed and, staring up at the gutter, made a disgusted face. 

“How can we be in the same grade and not know any of the same kids?” 
Hannah demanded. 

He turned to her, scratching his red hair with one hand. “I don’t know.” 
“How weird!” Hannah repeated. 

Danny stepped into the deep blue shadow of the house. Hannah squinted 
hard. He seemed to disappear in the wide rectangle of shadow. 

That’s impossible! she thought. 

I would have seen him at school. 

If we’re in the same grade, there’s no way I could have missed him. 

Is he lying? Is he making this all up? 

He had completely vanished in the shadow. Hannah squinted hard, waiting 
for her eyes to adjust. 

Where is he? Hannah asked herself. 



He keeps disappearing. 

Like a ghost. 

A ghost. The word popped in and out of her mind. 

When Danny came back into view, he was pulling an aluminum ladder 
along the back wall of the house. 

“What are you going to do?” Hannah asked, moving closer. 

“Get my ball,” he replied, and began climbing the ladder, his white Nikes 
hanging over the narrow metal rungs. 

Hannah moved closer. “Don’t go up there,” she said, suddenly gripped with 
a cold feeling. 

“Huh?” he called down. He was already halfway up the ladder, his head 
nearly level with the gutter. 

“Come down, Danny.” Hannah felt a wave of dread sweep over her. A 
heavy feeling in the pit of her stomach. 

“I’m a good climber,” he said, pulling himself up higher. “I climb 
everything. My mom says I should be in a circus or something.” 

Before Hannah could say anything more, he had clambered off the ladder 
and was standing on the sloping roof, his legs spread apart, his hands stretched 
high in the air. “See?” 

Hannah couldn’t shake the premonition, the heavy feeling of dread. 

“Danny—please!” 

Ignoring her shrill cry, he bent to pick the tennis ball from the gutter. 

Hannah held her breath as he reached for the ball. 

Suddenly, he lost his balance. His eyes went wide with surprise. 

His sneakers slipped on the shingles. His hands shot up as if trying to grab 
onto something. 

Hannah gasped, staring helplessly as Danny toppled headfirst off the roof.

Hannah screamed and shut her eyes. 

I’ve got to get help, she thought. 

Her heart pounding, she forced herself to open her eyes, and searched the 
ground for Danny. But to her surprise, he was standing in front of her, a 
mischievous grin on his face. 

“Huh?” Hannah uttered a gasp of surprise. “You—you’re okay?” 

Danny nodded, still grinning. 

He didn’t make a sound, Hannah thought, staring hard at him. He landed 
without making a sound. 

She grabbed his shoulder. “You’re okay?” 

“Yeah, I’m fine,” Danny said calmly. “My middle name is Daredevil. 
Danny Daredevil Anderson. That’s what my mom always says.” He tossed the 
ball casually from hand to hand. 

“You scared me to death!” Hannah cried. Her fright was turning to anger. 
“Why did you do that?” 

He laughed. 

“You could’ve been killed!” she told him. 

“No way,” he replied quietly. 

She scowled at him, staring hard into his brown eyes. “Do you do stuff like 
that all the time? Falling off roofs just to scare people?” 

His grin grew wider, but he didn’t say anything. He turned away from her 
and tossed the tennis ball at the house. 

Thock. 

“You were falling headfirst,” Hannah said. “How did you land on your 
feet?” 

Danny chuckled. “Magic,” he replied slyly. 

“But—but—!” 

“Hannah! Hannah!” She turned to see her mother calling to her from the 
back stoop. 

“What is it?” Hannah shouted. 

Thock. 



“I have to go out for an hour. Can you come take care of Bill and Herb?” 

Hannah turned back to Danny. “I’ve got to go. See you.” 

“See you,” he replied, flashing her a freckle-faced grin. 

Thock. 

Hannah heard the sound of the ball against the redwood wall as she jogged 
across the driveway to her house. Again, she pictured Danny plummeting off the 
roof. 

How did he do it? she wondered. How did he land on his feet so silently? 

‘Til only be gone an hour,” her mother said, searching her bag for the car 
keys. “How is it out? It’s supposed to cloud up and rain tonight.” 

Another weather report, Hannah thought, rolling her eyes. 

“Don’t let them kill each other, if you can help it,” Mrs. Fairchild said, 
finding the keys and shutting her bag. 

“That was Danny,” Hannah told her. “The new kid next door. Did you see 
him?” 

“Huh-uh. Sorry.” Mrs. Fairchild hurried to the door. 

“You didn’t see him?” Hannah called. 

The screen door slammed. 

Bill and Herb appeared and pulled Hannah into their room. “Chutes & 
Ladders!” Bill demanded. 

“Yeah. Let’s play Chutes & Ladders!” Herb echoed. 

Hannah rolled her eyes. She hated that game. It was so lame. “Okay,” she 
agreed with a sigh. She dropped down across from them on the rug. 

“Yaaaay!” Bill cried happily, opening the game-board. “You’ll play?” 

“Yeah. I’ll play,” Hannah told him unhappily. 

“And can we cheat?” Bill asked. 

“Yeah! Let’s cheat!” Herb urged with grinning enthusiasm. 


* * * 


After dinner, the twins were upstairs, arguing with their parents over which of 
them got to take the last bath. They both hated baths and always fought to be the 
last. 

Hannah helped clear the table, then wandered into the den. She was 
thinking about Danny as she made her way to the window. 

Pushing aside the curtains, she pressed her forehead against the cool glass 



and stared across the drive to Danny’s house. 

The sun had lowered behind the trees. Danny’s house was cast in heavy, 
dark shadows. The windows were covered with curtains and blinds. 

Hannah realized she had never actually seen anyone inside the house. She 
had never seen Danny go into the house or come out of it. 

She had never seen anyone come out of the house. 

Hannah stepped back from the window, thinking hard. She remembered the 
morning she had met Danny, after he had run her down in the back yard. She had 
been talking to him—and he had vanished into thin air. 

She thought about how he had seemed to disappear into the shadow at the 
side of his house, how she’d had to squint real hard to see him. And she thought 
about how he had seemed to float to the ground, landing silently from the roof. 

Silent as a ghost. 

“Hannah, what are you thinking ?” she scolded herself. 

Am I making up another ghost story? 

She suddenly had so many questions running through her mind: How had 
Danny and his family moved in without her noticing? How could he be in her 
school, in her grade, without her ever seeing him there? 

How come she didn’t know his friends, and he didn’t know hers? 

It’s all so weird, Hannah thought. 

I’m not imagining it all. I’m not making it up. 

What if Danny really is a ghost? 

If only she had someone to talk to, someone to discuss Danny with. But her 
friends were all away. And her parents would certainly never listen to such a 
crazy idea. 

I’ll have to prove it myself, Hannah decided. I’ll study him. I’ll be 
scientific. I’ll observe him. I’ll spy on him. 

Yes. I’ll spy on him. 

I’ll go look in his kitchen window, she decided. 

She stepped out onto the back stoop and pushed the screen door shut behind 
her. It was a warm, still night. A pale sliver of moon hung above the back yard in 
a royal-blue sky. 

As Hannah headed across her back yard, taking long, rapid strides, crickets 
began to chirp loudly. Danny’s house loomed in front of her, low and dark 
against the sky. 

The ladder was still propped against the back wall. 



Hannah crossed the driveway that separated her yard from his. Her heart 
pounding, she crept across the grass and climbed the three low concrete steps 
onto the back stoop. The kitchen door was closed. 

She stepped up to the door, pressed her face close to the window, peered 
into the kitchen—and gasped. 



7 


Hannah gasped because Danny was staring back at her from the other side of the 
window. 

“Oh!” she cried out and nearly toppled backwards off the narrow stoop. 

Inside the house, Danny’s eyes opened wide with surprise. 

Behind him, Hannah could see a table set with bright yellow plates. A tall, 
slender, blonde-haired woman—Danny’s mom, most likely—was pulling 
something out from a microwave oven onto the counter. 

The door swung open. Danny poked his head out, his expression still 
surprised. “Hi, Hannah. What’s up?” 

“Nothing. I—uh—nothing, really,” Hannah stammered. She could feel her 
cheeks grow hot, and knew she was blushing. 

Danny’s eyes burned into hers. His mouth turned up in a grin. “Well, do you 
want to come in or something?” he asked. “My mom is serving dinner, but—” 

“No!” she cried, much too loudly. “I don’t—I mean—I—” 

I’m acting like a total jerk! she realized. 

She swallowed hard, staring at his grinning face. 

He’s laughing at me! 

“See you!” she cried, then leapt awkwardly off the stoop, nearly stumbling 
to the ground. Without looking back, she took off, running at full speed back to 
her house. 

I’ve never been so embarrassed in my entire life! she thought miserably. 

Never! 

When she saw Danny come out of his house the next afternoon, Hannah hid 
behind the garage. Watching him walk his bike down the driveway, she felt her 
cheeks grow hot, felt embarrassed all over again. 

If I’m going to be a spy, I’m going to have to be a lot cooler, she told 
herself. Last night, I lost it. I panicked. 

It won’t happen again. 

She watched him climb on his bike and, standing up, pedal to the street. 
Pressed against the garage wall, she waited to see which direction he turned. 
Then she hurried into the garage to get her bike. 



He’s heading toward town, she saw. Probably meeting those two boys. I’ll 
let him get a head start, then I’ll follow him. 

She waited at the foot of the driveway, straddling her bike, watching Danny 
until he disappeared down the next block. 

Sunlight filtered through the overhanging trees as she began pedaling, 
keeping a slow, steady pace as she rode after him. Mrs. Quilty was out weeding 
her garden as usual. This time, Hannah didn’t bother to call hello. 

A small white terrier chased her for half a block, yapping loudly with 
excitement, then finally giving up as Hannah pedaled away. 

The school playground came into view. Several kids were playing softball 
on the corner diamond. Hannah looked for Danny, but he wasn’t there. 

She continued on into town. The sun felt warm on her face. She suddenly 
thought about Janey. Maybe I’ll get a letter from her today, she thought. 

She wished Janey were around to help spy on Danny. The two of them 
would be a great spy team, Hannah knew. She wouldn’t have lost her cool like 
she had last night if Janey were around. 

The town square came into view. The flag above the small, white post 
office was fluttering in a warm breeze. Several cars were parked in front of the 
grocery. Two women holding grocery bags were talking at the curb. 

Hannah braked her bike and lowered her feet to the ground. She shielded 
her eyes from the sun with one hand and searched for Danny. 

Danny, where are you? she thought. Are you with your friends? Where did 
you go? 

She pedaled across the small, grassy square toward the post office. Her bike 
bumped over the curb and she kept going, around the side of the building to the 
alley. 

But the alley was silent and empty. 

“Danny, where are you?” she called aloud in a quiet singsong. “Where are 
you?” 

He was only a block ahead of me, she thought, scratching her short hair. 
Has he vanished into thin air again? 

She rode back to the square, then checked out Harder’s Ice-Cream Parlor 
and the diner. 

No sign of him. 

“Hannah, you’re a great spy!” she laughed. 

With a sigh of defeat, she turned around and headed for home. 



She was nearly to her house when she saw the moving shadow. 

It’s back! she realized. 

She shifted gears and started to pedal harder. 

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the shadow sliding across Mrs. 
Quilty’s front lawn. 

The dark figure floated silently over the grass toward her. 

Hannah pedaled harder. 

It’s back. I didn’t imagine it. 

It’s real. 

But what can it be? 

Standing up, she pedaled harder. Harder. 

But the figure glided along with her, picking up speed, floating effortlessly. 
She turned to see its arms stretch out toward her. 

She gasped in terror. 

Her legs suddenly felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds. 

I—I can’t move! she thought. 

The shadow swept over her. She could feel the sudden cold. 

Sticklike black arms reached out for her from the human-shaped shadow. 

Its face—why can’t I see its face? Hannah wondered, struggling to keep 
moving. 

The shadow blocked the bright sun. The whole world was blackening 
beneath it. 

Got to keep moving. Got to move, Hannah told herself. 

The dark figure floated beside her, its arms outstretched. 

Gaping in horror, Hannah saw bright red eyes glowing like embers from the 
blackness. 

“Hannah...” it whispered. “Hannah...” 

What does it want from me? 

She struggled to keep pedaling, but her legs wouldn’t cooperate. 

“Hannah... Hannah...” 

The dry whisper seemed to circle her, to wrap her in terror. 

“Hannah...” 

“No!” she screamed as she felt herself start to fall. 

She struggled to keep her balance. 

Too late. 



She was falling. She couldn’t stop herself. 

“Hannah... Hannah...” 

She reached out her hands to break her fall. 

“Ooof!” 

She gasped in pain as she landed hard on her side. 

The bike fell on top of her. 

The shadow figure, its red eyes glowing, moved in to capture her. 
“Hannah! Hannah!” 



8 


“Hannah! Hannah!” 

Its whisper became a shout. 

“Hannah!” 

Her side throbbed with pain. She struggled to catch her breath. 

“What do you want?” she managed to cry. “Leave me alone! Please!” 
“Hannah! It’s me!” 

She raised her head to see Danny standing above her. He straddled his bike, 
gripping the handlebars, staring down at her, his features tight with concern. 
“Hannah—are you okay?” 

“The shadow—!” she cried, feeling dazed. 

Danny lowered his bike to the grass and hurried over. He lifted her bike off 
her and set it down beside his. Then he reached for her hands. “Are you okay? 
Can you get up? I saw you fall. Did you hit a rock or something?” 

“No.” She shook her head, trying to clear it. “The shadow—he reached for 
me and—” 

Danny’s expression changed to bewilderment. “Huh? Who reached for 
you?” His eyes searched all around, then returned to her. 

“He knew my name,” Hannah said breathlessly. “He kept calling me. He 
followed me.” 

Danny studied her, frowning. “Did you hit your head? Do you feel dizzy, 
Hannah? Maybe I should go get some help.” 

“No... I... uh...” She gazed up at him. “Didn’t you see him? He was 
dressed in black. He had these glowing red eyes—” 

Danny shook his head, his eyes still studying her warily. “I only saw you,” 
he said softly. “You were riding really fast. Over the grass. I saw you fall.” 

“You didn’t see someone wearing black? A man? Chasing me?” 

Danny shook his head. “There was no one else on the street, Hannah. Just 

me.” 

“Maybe I did bump my head,” Hannah muttered, raising her hands to her 
short hair. 

Danny reached out a hand. “Can you stand? Are you hurt?” 

“I—I guess I can stand.” She allowed him to pull her to her feet. 



Her heart was still pounding. Her entire body felt shaky. Narrowing her 
eyes, she searched the front yards, her eyes lingering in the wide circles of shade 
from the neighborhood’s old trees. 

No one in sight. 

“You really didn’t see anyone?” she asked in a tiny voice. 

He shook his head. “Just you. I was watching from over there.” He pointed 
to the curb. 

“But I thought...” Her voice trailed off. She could feel her face grow red. 

This is embarrassing, she thought. He’s going to think I’m a total nut case. 

And then she thought, maybe I am! 

“You were going so fast,” he said, picking up her bike for her. “And there 
are so many shadows, from all the trees. And you were frightened. So maybe 
you imagined a guy dressed in black.” 

“Maybe,” Hannah replied weakly. 

But she didn’t think so.... 

High white clouds drifted over the sun the next afternoon as Hannah jogged 
down the driveway to the mailbox. Somewhere down the block, a dog barked. 

She pulled down the lid and eagerly reached inside. 

Her hand slid over bare metal. 

No mail. Nothing. 

Sighing with disappointment, she slammed the mailbox lid shut. Janey had 
promised to write every day. She had been gone for weeks, and Hannah still 
hadn’t received even a postcard. 

None of her friends had written to her. 

As she trudged back up the driveway, Hannah glanced at Danny’s house. 
The white clouds were reflected in the glass of the big living room window. 

Hannah wondered if Danny was home. She hadn’t seen him since yesterday 
morning after falling off her bike. 

My spying isn’t going too well, she sighed. 

Taking another glance at Danny’s front window, Hannah headed back up 
the drive to the house. 

I’ll write to Janey again, she decided. I have to tell her about Danny and the 
frightening shadow figure and the weird things that have been happening. 

She could hear the twins in the den, arguing loudly about which cartoon 
tape they wanted to see. Her mother was suggesting they go outside instead. 



Hannah hurried to her room to get paper and a pen. The room felt hot and 
stuffy. She had tossed a pile of dirty clothes onto her desk. She decided to write 
her letter outside. 

A short while later, she settled under the wide maple tree in the center of the 
front yard. A blanket of high clouds had rolled over the sky. The sun was trying 
to poke out from the white glare. The old, leafy tree protected her in comforting 
shade. 

Hannah yawned. She hadn’t slept well the night before. Maybe I’ll take a 
nap later, she thought. But first, I have to write this letter. 

Leaning back against the solid trunk, she began to write. 

Dear Janey, 

How are you? I seriously hope you’ve fallen in the lake and drowned. That 
would be the only good excuse for not writing to me in all this time! 

How could you ABANDON me here like this? Next summer, one way or the 
other, I’m going to camp with you. 

Things are definitely WEIRD around here. Do you remember I told you 
about that boy who moved in next door? His name is Danny Anderson, and he’s 
kind of cute. He has red hair and freckles and SERIOUS brown eyes. 

Well, don’t laugh, Janey—but I think Danny is a GHOST! 

I can hear you laughing. But I don’t care. By the time you get back to 
Greenwood Falls, I’m going to have PROOF. 

Please — don’t tell the other girls in your bunk that your best friend has 
totally freaked until you read the rest of this. Here is my evidence so far: 

1. Danny and his family suddenly appeared in the house next door. I didn’t 
see them move in, even though I’ve been home every day. Neither did my 
parents. 

2. Danny says he goes to Maple Avenue, and he says he’s going into eighth 
grade just like us. 

But how come we’ve never seen him? He hangs out with two guys I’ve 
never seen before. And he didn’t know any of my friends. 

3. Sometimes he vanishes — POOF—just like that. Don’t laugh! And once he 
fell off the roof and landed on his feet—without making a SOUND! I’m 
SERIOUS, Janey. 

4. Yesterday, I was being chased by a scary shadow, and I fell off my bike. 
And when I looked up, the shadow was gone, and Danny was standing in his 



place. And — 

Uh-oh. This is starting to sound really crazy. I wish you were here so I 
could explain it better. It all sounds so DUMB in a letter. Like I’m really 
MESSED UP or something. 

I know you’re laughing at me. Well, go ahead. 

Maybe I won’t mail this letter. I mean, I don’t want you to make jokes, or 
remind me of it for the rest of my life. 

So, enough about me. 

How’s it going out there in the woods? I hope you were bitten by a snake 
and your entire body swelled up, and that’s why I haven’t heard from you. 

Otherwise, I’m going to KILL you when you get back! Really! 

WRITE! 


Love, 

Hannah 


Yawning loudly, Hannah dropped her pen to the ground. She leaned back 
against the tree trunk and slowly read over the letter. 

Is it too crazy to send? she wondered. 

No. I have to send it. I have to tell somebody what’s going on here. It’s all 
too weird to keep to myself. 

The sun had finally managed to burst through the clouds. The tree leaves 
above her head cast shifting shadows across the letter in her lap. 

She glanced up into bright sunlight—and gasped, startled to see a face 
staring back at her. 

“Danny—!” 

“Hi, Hannah,” he said quietly. 

Hannah squinted up at him. His entire body was ringed by bright sunlight. 
He seemed to be shimmering in the light. 

“I—I didn’t see you,” Hannah stammered. “I didn’t know you were here. I 

“Give me the letter, Hannah,” Danny said softly but insistently. He reached 
out a hand for it. 

“Huh? What did you say?” 

“Give me the letter,” Danny demanded, more firmly. “Give it to me now, 
Hannah.” 

She gripped the letter tightly and stared up at him. She had to shield her 



eyes. The bright sun seemed to shine right through him. 

He hovered above her, his hand outstretched. “The letter. Hand it to me,” he 
insisted. 

“But—why?” Hannah asked in a tiny voice. 

“I can’t let you mail it,” Danny told her. 

“Why, Danny? It’s my letter. Why can’t I mail it to my friend?” 

“Because you found out the truth about me,” he said. “And there’s no way 
I’ll let you tell anyone.”

“So, I’m right,” Hannah said softly. “You’re a ghost.” 

She shuddered, a wave of cold fear sweeping over her. 

When did you die, Danny? 

Why are you here? To haunt me? 

What are you going to do to me? 

Questions raced through her mind. Frightening questions. 

“Give me the letter, Hannah,” Danny insisted. “No one will ever read it. No 
one can know.” 

“But, Danny—” She stared up at him. Stared up at a ghost. 

The golden sunlight poured through him. He shimmered in and out of view. 

She raised a hand to shield her eyes. 

He became too bright, too bright to look at. 

“What are you going to do to me, Danny?” Hannah asked, shutting her eyes 
tight. “What are you going to do to me now?” 

He didn’t reply. 

When Hannah opened her eyes, she stared up into two faces instead of one. 

Two grinning faces. 

Her twin brothers pointed at her and laughed. “You were asleep,” Bill said. 

“You were snoring,” Herb told her. 

“Huh?” Hannah blinked several times, trying to clear her mind. Her neck 
felt stiff. Her back ached. 

“Here’s how you were snoring,” Herb said. He performed some hideous 
snuffling sounds. 

Both boys fell to the grass, laughing. They rolled onto each other and began 
an impromptu wrestling match. 

“I had a bad dream,” Hannah said, more to herself than to her brothers. 
They weren’t listening to her. 

She climbed to her feet and stretched her arms above her head, trying to 
stretch away her stiff neck. “Ow.” Falling asleep sitting up against a tree trunk 
was a bad idea. 

Hannah gazed toward Danny’s house. That dream was so real, she thought, 



feeling a cold chill down her back. So frightening. 

“Thanks for waking me up,” she told the twins. They didn’t hear her. They 
were racing toward the back yard. 

Hannah bent down and picked up the letter. 

She folded it in half and made her way up the lawn to the front door. 
Sometimes dreams tell the truth, she thought, her shoulders still aching. 
Sometimes dreams tell you things you couldn’t know any other way. 

I’m going to find out the tmth about Danny, she vowed. 

I’m going to find out the truth if it kills me. 

The next evening, Hannah decided to see if Danny was home. Maybe he’d like 
to walk to Harders and get ice-cream cones, she thought. 

She told her mother where she was going and made her way across the back 

yard. 

It had rained all day. The grass glistened wetly, and the ground beneath her 
sneakers was soft and marshy. A pale, crescent-shaped moon rose above wisps of 
black cloud. The night air felt tingly and wet. 

Hannah crossed the driveway, then hesitated a few yards from Danny’s 
back stoop. A square of dim yellow light escaped through the window on the 
back door. 

She remembered standing at this door a few nights before and being totally 
embarrassed when Danny opened the door and she couldn’t think of a thing to 
say. 

At least this time I know what I’m going to say, she thought. 

Taking a deep breath, Hannah stepped into the square of light on the stoop. 
She knocked on the window of the kitchen door. 

She listened. The house was silent. 

She knocked again. 

Silence. No footsteps to answer the door. 

She leaned forward and peered into the kitchen. 

“Oh!” Hannah cried out in surprise. 

Danny’s mother sat at the yellow kitchen table, her back to Hannah, her hair 
glowing in the light of a low ceiling fixture. She had both hands wrapped around 
a steaming white coffee mug. 

Why doesn’t she answer the door? Hannah wondered. 

She hesitated, then raised her fist and knocked loudly on the door. Several 



times. 

Through the window, she could see that Danny’s mother didn’t react to the 
knocking at all. She lifted the white mug to her lips and took a long sip, her back 
to Hannah. 

“Answer the door!” Hannah cried aloud. 

She knocked again. And called: “Mrs. Anderson! Mrs. Anderson! It’s me— 
Hannah! From next door!” 

Under the cone of light, Danny’s mother set the white mug down on the 
yellow table. She didn’t turn around. She didn’t move from her chair. 

“Mrs. Anderson—!” 

Hannah raised her hand to knock, then lowered it in defeat. 

Why doesn’t she hear me? Hannah wondered, staring at the woman’s 
slender shoulders, at her hair gleaming down past the collar of her blouse. 

Why won’t she come to the door? 

And then Hannah shivered with fear as she answered her own questions. 

I know why she doesn’t hear me, Hannah thought, backing away from the 
window. 

I know why she doesn’t answer the door. 

Overcome with fear, Hannah uttered a low moan and backed away from the 
light, off the stoop, into the safety of the darkness. 



10 


Trembling all over, Hannah wrapped her arms around her chest, as if shielding 
herself from her frightening thoughts. 

Mrs. Anderson doesn’t hear me because she isn’t real, Hannah realized. 

She isn’t real. She’s a ghost. 

Like Danny. 

A ghost family has moved next door to me. 

And here I am, standing in this dark back yard, trying to spy on a boy who 
isn’t even alive! Here I am, trembling all over, cold with fear, trying to prove 
what I’m already sure of. He’s a ghost. His mother is a ghost. 

And I—I— 

The kitchen light went out. The back of Danny’s house was completely 
dark now. 

The pale light from the crescent moon trickled onto the glistening, wet 
grass. Hannah stood, listening to the silence, trying to force away the frightening 
thoughts that crowded her mind until it felt as if her head were about to burst. 

Where is Danny? she wondered. 

Crossing the driveway, she headed back to her house. She could hear music 
and voices from the TV in the den. She could hear the twins’ laughter floating 
out from the upstairs window of their room. 

Ghosts, she thought, staring at the lighted windows, like bright eyes shining 
back at her. 

Ghosts. 

I don’t believe in ghosts! 

The thought made her feel a little less frightened. She suddenly realized her 
throat was dry. The night air felt hot and sticky against her skin. 

She thought of ice-cream again. Going to Harder’s and getting a double¬ 
scoop cone seemed an excellent idea. Cookies-and-Cream, Hannah thought. She 
could already taste it. 

She hurried into the house to tell her parents she was walking into town. At 
the doorway to the dark-paneled den, she stopped. Her parents, bathed in the 
glow of the TV screen, turned to her expectantly. 

“What’s up, Hannah?” 



She had a sudden impulse to tell them everything. And so she did. 

“The people next door, they’re not alive,” she blurted out. “They’re ghosts. 
You know Danny, the boy my age? He’s a ghost. I know he is! And his mother 

55 

“Hannah, please—we’re trying to watch,” her father said, pointing to the 
TV with the can of diet Coke in his hand. 

They don’t believe me, she thought. 

And then she scolded herself: Of course they don’t believe me. Who would 
believe such a crazy story? 

In her room, she took a five-dollar bill from her wallet and shoved it into 
the pocket of her shorts. Then she brushed her hair, studying her face in the 
mirror. 

I look okay, she thought. I don’t look like a crazy person. 

Her hair was damp from the wet night air. Maybe I’ll let it grow, she 
thought, watching it fall into shape around her face. I should have something to 
show for this summer! 

As she headed toward the front door, she heard loud bumping and banging 
above her head. The twins must be wrestling up in their room, she realized, 
shaking her head. 

She stepped back out into the warm, wet darkness, jogged down the front 
lawn to the sidewalk, and headed toward town and Harder’s Ice-Cream Parlor. 

The tall, old-fashioned-looking streetlamps cast circles of blue-white light 
along the street. The trees, trembling in soft gusts of wind, rustled over the 
sidewalk as Hannah stepped beneath them. 

Ghosts on the sidewalk, she thought with a shiver. They seemed to reach 
down for her with their leafy arms. 

As she neared town, a strange feeling of dread swept over her. She 
quickened her pace as she passed the post office, its windows as black as the sky. 

The town square was deserted, she saw. It wasn’t even eight o’clock, and 
there were no cars passing through town, no one on the streets. 

“What a hick town!” she muttered under her breath. 

Behind the bank, she turned onto Elm Street. Harder’s Ice-Cream Parlor 
stood on the next corner, a large red neon ice-cream cone in its window, casting a 
red glow onto the sidewalk. 

At least Harder’s stays open past dark, Hannah thought. 

As she walked closer, she could see the glass front door of the small shop 



propped open invitingly. 

She stopped a few feet from the door. 

The feeling of dread suddenly became overpowering. Despite the heat of 
the night, she felt cold all over. Her knees trembled. 

What’s going on? she wondered. Why do I feel so strange? 

As she stared through the red glare of the neon cone into the open doorway, 
a figure burst out. 

Followed by another. And another. 

Into the light, they ran, their faces twisted in fear. 

Staring in surprise, she recognized Danny in front, followed by Alan and 

Fred. 

They each held ice-cream cones in front of them. 

They ran from the store, bent forward as if straining to flee as fast as 
possible. Their sneakers thudded against the pavement of the sidewalk. 

Hannah heard loud, angry shouts from inside the shop. 

Without realizing it, she had moved close to the door. 

She could still hear the three boys running away. But she could no longer 
see them in the darkness. 

She turned—and felt something hit her hard from behind. 

“Ohh!” She cried out as she was thrown heavily onto the hard pavement. 



11 


Hannah landed hard on the sidewalk on her elbows and knees. The fall took her 
breath away. 

A burning pain shot through her body. 

What happened? 

What hit me? 

Gasping for breath, she raised her head in time to see Mr. Harder barrel past 
her. He was shouting at the top of his lungs for the boys to stop. 

Hannah slowly pulled herself to her feet. Whoa! she thought. Harder is 
really mad! 

Standing up straight, her bare knees throbbing with pain, her heart still 
thudding loudly, she glared after the store owner. 

He could have at least said he was sorry he knocked me down, she thought 
angrily. 

She leaned over to examine her knees in the light from the ice-cream parlor. 
Were they cut? 

No. Just a little bruised. 

Brushing off her shorts, she glanced up to see Mr. Harder hurrying back to 
the store. He was a short, fat man with curls of white hair around his round, pink 
face. He wore a long white apron that flapped in the wind as he walked, his fists 
swinging at his sides. 

Hannah ducked back out of the light, behind a wide tree trunk. 

A few seconds later, she could hear him back behind the counter, 
complaining loudly to his wife. “What is wrong with these kids?” he was 
bellowing. “They take ice-cream and run without paying? Don’t they have 
parents? Don’t they have anyone to teach them right from wrong?” 

Mrs. Harder murmured something to soothe her husband. Hannah couldn’t 
hear the words. 

With Mr. Harder’s angry shouts filling the air, she crept out from behind the 
tree and hurried away, in the direction the boys had run. 

Why did Danny and his friends pull such a stupid stunt? she wondered. 
What if they had been caught? Was it really worth being arrested, getting a 
police record just for an ice-cream cone? 



Halfway down the block, she could still hear Mr. Harder bellowing with 
rage from inside his small shop. Hannah started to run, eager to get away from 
his angry voice. Her left knee ached. 

The air suddenly felt stifling hot, heavy and damp. Strands of hair were 
matted against her forehead from sweat. 

She pictured Danny running from the store, holding the ice-cream cone in 
one hand. She pictured the frightened expression on his face as he fled. She 
pictured Alan and Fred right behind him, their sneakers thudding against the 
pavement as they made their getaway. 

And now she was running, too. She wasn’t sure why. 

Her left knee still ached from her fall. She was out of the town square now, 
running past dark houses and lawns. 

She turned a corner, the streetlamp casting a cone of white light around her. 
More houses. A few porchlights lit. No one on the street. 

Such a boring little town, she thought again. 

She stopped short when she saw the three boys. They were halfway up the 
block, huddled behind a tall, wall-like hedge. 

“Hey—you guys!” Her voice came out a whisper. 

Running in the street, she made her way toward them quickly. As she came 
closer, she could see them laughing together, enjoying their ice-cream cones. 

They hadn’t seen her. Hannah made her way into the deep shadows on the 
other side of the street. Keeping in the dark, she crept closer, until she was in the 
yard across the street from them, hidden by a bushy evergreen shrub. 

Fred and Alan were shoving each other playfully, enjoying their triumph 
over the store owner. Danny stood by himself, behind them against the tall 
hedge, silently licking his cone. 

“Harder’s was having a special tonight,” Alan declared loudly. “Free ice¬ 
cream!” 

Fred hee-hawed and slapped Alan hard on the back. 

Both boys turned to Danny. The light from the streetlamp made their faces 
look pale and green. “You looked real scared,” Alan told Danny. “I thought you 
were going to puke your guts out.” 

“Hey, no way,” Danny insisted. “I was the first one out of there, you know. 
You guys were so slow, I thought I’d have to come back and rescue you.” 

“Yeah. For sure,” Fred replied sarcastically. 

Danny’s acting tough, Hannah realized. He’s trying to be like them. 



“That was kind of exciting,” Danny said, tossing the remainder of his cone 
into the hedge. “But maybe we’d better be careful. You know. Not hang around 
there for a while.” 

“Hey, it’s not like we robbed a bank or something,” Alan said. “It was just 
ice-cream.” 

Fred said something to Alan that Hannah couldn’t hear, and the two boys 
started wrestling around, uttering high-pitched giggles. 

“Hey, guys—not so loud,” Danny warned. “I mean—” 

“Let’s go back to Harder’s,” Alan suggested. “I wanted two scoops!” 

Fred hee-hawed and slapped Alan a high-five. Danny joined in the laughter. 

“Hey, guys—we should get going,” Danny said. 

Before his friends could reply, the street filled with light. 

Hannah turned to see two bright white lights looming toward them. 

Car headlights. 

The police, Hannah thought. 

They’re caught. All three of them are caught. 



12 


The car stopped. 

Hannah peered out from behind the shrub. 

“Hey, you kids—” the driver called to the boys in a gruff voice. He poked 
his head out the car window. 

It isn’t the police, Hannah realized, breathing a long sigh of relief. 

The boys froze against the hedge. In the dim light from the streetlamp, 
Hannah could see that the driver was an elderly man, white-haired, wearing 
glasses. 

“We’re not doing anything. Just talking,” Fred called to the man. 

“Do any of you know how to get to Route 112?” the man asked. The light 
went on inside the car. Hannah could see a roadmap in the man’s hand. 

Fred and Alan laughed, relieved laughter. Danny continued to stare at the 
driver, his expression still frightened. 

“Route 112?” the man repeated. 

“Main Street turns into Route 112,” Alan told the man, pointing in the 
direction the car was heading. “Go up two blocks. Then turn right.” 

The light went out in the car. The man thanked them and drove off. 

The boys watched until the car had disappeared in the darkness. Fred and 
Alan slapped each other high-fives. Then Fred shoved Alan into the hedge. They 
all laughed giddily. 

“Hey, look where we are,” Alan said, surprised. 

The boys turned toward the driveway. From her hiding place across the 
street, Hannah followed their gaze. 

At the end of the hedge stood a tall wooden mailbox on a pole. A hand- 
carved swan’s head perched on top of the box, which had graceful wings jutting 
out from its sides. 

“It’s Chesney’s house,” Alan said, making his way along the hedge toward 
the mailbox. He grabbed the wings with both hands. “Do you believe this 
mailbox?” 

“Chesney carved it himself,” Fred said, snickering. “What a dork.” 

“It’s his pride and joy,” Alan sneered. He pulled open the lid and peered 
inside. “Empty.” 



“Who would write to him?” Danny declared, trying to sound as tough as his 
two friends. 

“Hey, I’ve got an idea, Danny,” Fred said. He stepped behind Danny and 
started shoving him toward the mailbox. 

“Whoa,” Danny protested. 

But Fred pushed him up to the mailbox. “Let’s see how strong you are,” 
Fred said. 

“Hey, wait—” Danny cried. 

Hannah leaned out from behind the low shrub. “Oh, wow,” she muttered to 
herself. “Now what are they going to do?” 

“Take the mailbox,” she heard Alan order Danny. “I dare you.” 

“We dare you,” Fred added. “Remember what you told us about dares, 
Danny? How you never turn one down?” 

“Yeah. You told us you never turn down a dare,” Alan said, grinning. 

Danny hesitated. “Well, I—” 

A heavy feeling of dread formed in the pit of Hannah’s stomach. Watching 
Danny step toward Mr. Chesney’s hand-carved mailbox, she suddenly had a 
premonition—a feeling that something really terrible was about to happen. 

I’ve got to stop them, she decided. 

Taking a deep breath, she stepped out from behind the bush. 

As she started to call to them, everything went black. 

“Hey—!” she cried aloud. 

What had happened? 

Her first thought was that the streetlamp had gone out. 

But then Hannah saw the two red circles glowing in front of her. 

The two glowing eyes surrounded by darkness. 

The shadow figure rose up inches in front of her. 

She tried to scream, but her voice was muffled in its heavy darkness. 

She tried to run, but it blocked her path. 

The red eyes burned into hers. 

Closer. Closer. 

It’s got me now, Hannah knew. 



13 


“Hannah...” it whispered. “Hannah...” 

So close, she could smell its hot, sour breath. 

“Hannah... Hannah...” Its whisper like crackling, dead leaves. 

The ruby eyes burned like fire. Hannah felt the darkness circle her, wrap 
around her tightly. 

“Please—” was all she could manage to choke out. 

“Hannah...” 

And the light returned. 

Hannah blinked, struggled to breathe. 

The sour odor lingered in her nostrils. But the street was bright now. 

Car headlights washed over her. 

It—it’s gone, Hannah realized. The lights had chased away the shadow 
figure. 

But would it return? 

As the car passed by, Hannah dropped to the ground behind the low 
evergreen shrub and struggled to catch her breath. When she looked up, the boys 
were still huddled in front of Mr. Chesney’s hedge. 

“Let’s get going,” Danny urged them. 

“No way. Not yet,” Alan said, stepping in front of Danny to block his way. 
“You’re forgetting about our dare.” 

Fred shoved Danny toward the mailbox. “Go ahead. Take it.” 

“Hey, wait.” Danny spun around. “I never said I’d do it.” 

“I dared you to take Chesney’s mailbox,” Fred told him. “Remember? You 
told us you never turned down a dare?” 

Alan laughed. “Chesney will come out tomorrow and think his swan flew 
away.” 

“No, wait—” Danny protested. “Maybe it’s a dumb idea.” 

“It’s a cool idea. Chesney is a creep,” Alan insisted. “Everyone in 
Greenwood Falls hates his guts.” 

“Take his mailbox, Danny,” Fred challenged. “Pull it up. Come on. I dare 
you.” 



“No, I—” Danny tried to back away, but Fred held him from behind by the 
shoulders. 

“You chicken?” Alan challenged. 

“Look at the chicken,” Fred said in a mocking, babyish voice. “Cluck 
cluck.” 

“I’m not a chicken,” Danny snapped angrily. 

“Prove it,” Alan demanded. He grabbed Danny’s hands and raised them to 
the carved wings that stretched from the sides of the mailbox. “Go ahead. Prove 
it.” 

“What a riot!” Fred declared. “The town postmaster—his mailbox flies 
away.” 

Don’t do it, Danny, Hannah urged silently from her dark hiding place across 
the street. Please — don’t do it. 

Another set of car headlights made the three boys back away from the 
mailbox. The car rolled past without slowing. 

“Let’s go. It’s getting late,” Hannah heard Danny say. 

But Fred and Alan insisted, teasing him, challenging him. 

As Hannah stared into the white light of the streetlamp, Danny stepped up 
to Chesney’s mailbox and grabbed the wings. 

“Danny, wait—” Hannah cried. 

He didn’t seem to hear her. 

With a loud groan, he began to tug. 

It didn’t budge. 

He lowered his hands to the pole and wrapped them tightly around it just 
below the box. 

He tugged again. 

“It’s in really deep,” he told Alan and Fred. “I don’t know if I can get it.” 

“Try again,” Alan urged. 

“We’ll help you,” Fred said, placing his hands above Danny’s on the box. 

“Let’s all pull together,” Alan urged. “At the count of three.” 

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you!” exclaimed a gruff voice behind them. 

They all turned to see Mr. Chesney glaring at them from the driveway, his 
face knotted in a furious snarl. 



14 


Mr. Chesney grabbed Danny’s shoulders and pulled him away from the mailbox. 

One of the wooden swan wings came off in Danny’s hands. As Mr. Chesney 
wrestled him away, Danny let it drop to the ground. 

“You punks!” Mr. Chesney sputtered, his eyes wide with rage. “You—you 

“Let go of him!” Hannah screamed from across the street. But fear muffled 
her voice. Her cry came out a whisper. 

With a loud groan, Danny pulled free of the man’s grasp. 

Without another word, the three boys were running, running down the 
middle of the dark street, their sneakers pounding loudly on the pavement. 

“I’ll remember you!” Mr. Chesney called after them. “I’ll remember you. 
I’ll see you again! And next time, I’ll have my shotgun!” 

Hannah watched Mr. Chesney bend to pick up the broken swan’s wing. He 
examined the wooden wing, shaking his head angrily. 

Then she began running, keeping in the dark front yards, hidden by hedges 
and low shrubs, running in the direction Danny and his friends had headed. 

She saw the boys turn a corner, and kept running. Keeping well behind, she 
followed them through the town square, still deserted and dark. Even Harders 
ice-cream parlor was closed now, the shop dark behind the red glare of the neon 
window sign. 

Two dogs, tall, ungainly mutts with thin, shaggy frames, crossed the street 
in front of them, trotting slowly, out for their evening walk. The dogs didn’t look 
up as the boys ran past. 

Halfway up the next block, she saw Fred and Alan collapse beneath a dark 
tree, giggling up at the sky as they sprawled on the ground. 

Danny leaned against the wide tree trunk, panting loudly. 

Fred and Alan couldn’t stop laughing. “Did you see the look on his face 
when that stupid wing dropped off?” Fred cried. 

“I thought his eyes were going to pop out!” Alan exclaimed gleefully. “I 
thought his head was going to explode!” 

Danny didn’t join in their laughter. He rubbed his right shoulder with one 
hand. “He really wrecked my shoulder when he grabbed me,” he said, groaning. 



“You should sue him!” Alan suggested. 

He and Fred laughed uproariously, sitting up to slap each other high-fives. 

“No. Really,” Danny said quietly, still rubbing the shoulder. “He really hurt 
me. When he swung me around, I thought—” 

“What a creep,” Fred said, shaking his head. 

“We’ll have to pay him back,” Alan added. “We’ll have to—” 

“Maybe we should stay away from there,” Danny said, still breathing hard. 
“You heard what he said about getting his shotgun.” 

The other two boys laughed scornfully. “Yeah. For sure. He’d really come 
after us with a shotgun,” Alan scoffed, brushing blades of freshly cut grass from 
his scraggly hair. 

“The respected town postmaster, shooting at innocent kids,” Fred said, 
snickering. “No way. He was just trying to scare us—right, Danny?” 

Danny stopped rubbing his shoulder and frowned down at Alan and Fred, 
who were still sitting in the grass. “I don’t know.” 

“Oooh, Danny is scared!” Fred cried. 

“You’re not scared of that old geek, are you?” Alan demanded. “Just 
because he grabbed your shoulder doesn’t mean—” 

“I don’t know,” Danny interrupted angrily. “The old guy seemed pretty out 
of control to me. He was so angry! I mean, maybe he would shoot us to protect 
his precious mailbox.” 

“Bet we could make him a lot angrier,” Alan said quietly, climbing to his 
feet, staring intently at Danny. 

“Yeah. Bet we could,” Fred agreed, grinning. 

“Unless you’re chicken, Danny,” Alan said, moving close to Danny, 
challenge in his voice. 

“I—it’s getting late,” Danny said, trying to read his watch in the dark. “I 
promised my mom I’d get home.” 

Fred climbed to his feet and moved next to Alan. “We should teach 
Chesney a lesson,” he said, brushing blades of grass off the back of his jeans. 
His eyes gleamed mischievously in the dim light. “We should teach him not to 
pick on innocent kids.” 

“Yeah, you’re right,” Alan agreed, his eyes on Danny. “I mean, he hurt 
Danny. He had no business grabbing him like that.” 

“I’ve got to get home. See you guys tomorrow,” Danny said, waving. 

“Okay. See you,” Fred called after him. 



“At least we got some free ice-cream tonight!” Alan exclaimed. 

As Danny walked quickly away, Hannah could hear Alan and Fred giggling 
their gleeful, high-pitched giggles. 

Free ice-cream, she thought, frowning. Those two guys are really looking 
for trouble. 

She couldn’t help herself. She had to say something to Danny. “Hey!” she 
called, running to catch up to him. 

He spun around, startled. “Hannah—what are you doing here?” 

“I—I followed you. From the ice-cream store,” she confessed. 

He snickered. “You saw everything?” 

She nodded. “Why do you hang out with those two guys?” she demanded. 

He scowled, avoiding her eyes, picking up his pace. “They’re okay,” he 
muttered. 

“They’re going to get in big trouble one of these days,” Hannah predicted. 
“They really are.” 

Danny shmgged. “They just talk tough. They think it’s cool. But they’re 
really okay.” 

“But they stole ice-cream cones and—” Hannah decided she’d said enough. 

They crossed the street in silence. 

Hannah glanced up to see the pale crescent of moon disappear behind black 
wisps of cloud. The street grew darker. The trees shook their leaves, sending 
whispers all around. 

Danny kicked a stone down the sidewalk. It clattered softly onto the grass. 

Hannah suddenly remembered going over to Danny’s house earlier to get 
him. In all the excitement of the stolen ice-cream cones and Mr. Chesney and his 
mailbox, she had completely forgotten what had happened on his back stoop. 

“I—I went over to your house tonight,” she started reluctantly. “Before I 
went into town.” 

Danny stopped and turned to her, his eyes studying hers. “Yeah?” 

“I thought maybe you’d want to walk to town or something,” Hannah 
continued. “Your mother was home. In the kitchen.” 

He continued to stare hard at her, as if trying to read her thoughts. 

“I knocked and knocked on the kitchen door,” Hannah said, tugging a 
strand of blonde hair off her forehead. “I could see your mother at the table. She 
had her back to me. She didn’t turn around or anything.” 

Danny didn’t reply. He lowered his eyes to the pavement and started 



walking again, hands shoved in his pockets. 

“It was so strange,” Hannah continued. “I knocked and knocked. Really 
loud. But it was like—like your mother was in a different world or something. 
She didn’t answer the door. She didn’t even turn around.” 

Their houses came into view ahead of them. A porchlight sent a yellow 
glow over Hannah’s front lawn. On the other side of the driveway, Danny’s 
house loomed in darkness. 

Hannah’s throat suddenly felt dry. She wished she could ask Danny what 
she really wanted to ask. 

Are you a ghost? Is your mother a ghost, too? 

That was the real question in Hannah’s mind. 

But it was too crazy. Too stupid. 

How can you ask a person if he is real or not? If he is alive or not? 

“Danny—why didn’t your mother answer the door?” she asked quietly. 

Danny turned at the bottom of her driveway, his expression set, his eyes 
narrowed. His face glowed eerily in the pale yellow light from the porch. 

“Why?” Hannah repeated impatiently. “Why didn’t she answer the door?” 

He hesitated. 

“I guess I should tell you the truth,” he said finally, his voice a whisper, as 
soft as the whisper of the shuddering trees. 



15 


Danny leaned close to Hannah. She could see that his red hair was matted to his 
forehead by perspiration. His eyes burned into hers. 

“There’s a good reason why my mother didn’t answer the door,” Danny told 
her. 

Because she’s a ghost, Hannah thought. She felt a cold shiver roll down her 
back. A tremor of fear. 

She swallowed hard. Am I afraid of Danny? she asked herself. 

Yes. A little, she realized. Her scary dream about him flashed into her mind. 
Yes. A little. 

“You see,” Danny started, then hesitated. He cleared his throat. He shifted 
his weight nervously. “You see, my mom is deaf.” 

“Huh?” Hannah wasn’t sure she had heard correctly. It wasn’t at all what 
she was expecting. 

“She got this inner-ear infection,” Danny explained in a low voice, keeping 
his eyes trained on Hannah. “In both ears. A couple of years ago. The doctors 
treated it, but the infection spread. They thought they could save one ear, but 
they couldn’t. It made her completely deaf.” 

“You—you mean—?” Hannah stammered. 

“That’s why she couldn’t hear you knocking,” Danny explained. “She can’t 
hear anything at all.” He lowered his eyes to the ground. 

“I see,” Hannah replied awkwardly. “I’m sorry, Danny. I didn’t know. I 
thought... well, I didn’t know what to think.” 

“Mom doesn’t like people to know,” Danny continued, backing toward his 
house. “She thinks people will feel sorry for her if they know. She hates to have 
people feeling sorry for her. She’s a really good lip-reader. She usually fools 
people.” 

“Well, I won’t say anything,” Hannah replied. “I mean, I won’t tell anyone. 
I—” She suddenly felt very stupid. 

Her head lowered, she made her way up the driveway toward her front 
walk. 

“See you tomorrow,” Danny called. 

“Yeah. Okay,” she replied, thinking about what he had just told her. 



She looked up to wave good-night to him. 

But he had vanished. 

Hannah turned and began jogging around the side of the house toward the back 
door. Danny’s words troubled her. She realized all of her thoughts about ghosts 
may have been a big mistake. 

Her parents were always predicting that some day her imagination would 
mn away with her. 

Now maybe it has, Hannah thought unhappily. 

Maybe I’ve totally lost it. 

She turned the corner of the house and started toward the back door, her 
sneakers squishing on the soft, wet ground. 

The light over the porch sent a narrow cone of white light onto the concrete 
stoop. 

Hannah was nearly to the door when the dark figure, wrapped in black 
shadow, its red eyes glowing like hot coals, stepped into the light, blocking her 
path. 

“Hannah—stay away!” It whispered, pointing menacingly at her with one 
long, shadowy finger. 



16 


Gripped with horror, Hannah thought she saw the shadow of an evil grin inside 
the deeper shadow that hovered over the stoop. “Hannah, stay away. Stay away 
from DANNY!” 

“Noooooooooo!” 

In her panic, Hannah didn’t even realize that the howl came from her own 
throat. 

The red eyes glowed brighter in reaction to her scream. The fiery stare 
burned into her eyes, forcing her to shield her face with both hands. 

“Hannah—listen to my warning.” The dreadful dry whisper. 

The whisper of death. 

The sinewy black finger, outlined in the white porchlight, pointed to her, 
threatened her again. 

And again Hannah cried out in a voice hoarse with terror: “Nooooooo!” 

The dark figure swept closer. 

Closer. 

And then the kitchen door swung open, throwing a long rectangle of light 
over the yard. 

“Hannah—is that you? What’s going on?” 

Her father stepped into the light, his features knotted with concern, his eyes 
peering into the darkness through his square eyeglasses. 

“Dad—!” Hannah’s voice caught in her throat. “Look out, Dad—he—he—” 
Hannah pointed. 

Pointed to empty air. 

Pointed to the empty rectangle of light from the kitchen door. 

Pointed to nothing. 

The shadow figure had disappeared once again. 

Her mind spinning in confusion, feeling dazed and terrified, she hurried 
past her father, into the house. 

She had told her parents about the frightening dark figure with the glowing red 
eyes. Her father carefully searched the back yard, his flashlight playing over the 
lawn. He found no footprints in the soft, wet ground, no sign at all of an intruder. 



Hannah’s mother had gazed intently at her, studying her, as if trying to find 
some kind of answer in Hannah’s eyes. 

“I—I’m not crazy,” Hannah stammered angrily. 

Mrs. Fairchild’s cheeks turned pink. “I know that,” she replied tensely. 

“Should I call the police? There’s nothing back there,” Mr. Fairchild said, 
scratching his thinning brown hair, his eyeglasses reflecting the light from the 
kitchen ceiling. 

“I’ll just go to bed,” Hannah told them, moving abruptly to the door. “I’m 
really tired.” 

Her legs felt trembly and weak as she hurried down the hall to her room. 

Sighing wearily, she pushed open her bedroom door. 

The dark shadow figure was waiting for her by her bed. 



17 


Hannah gasped and started to back away. 

But as the hall light fell into the bedroom, she realized she wasn’t staring at 
the frightening figure after all. 

She was staring at a longsleeved, dark sweater she had tossed over the 
bedpost at the foot of her bed. 

Hannah gripped the sides of the doorway. She couldn’t decide whether to 
laugh or cry. 

“What a night!” she exclaimed out loud. 

She clicked on the bedroom ceiling light, then closed the door behind her. 
As she made her way over to the bed to pull the sweater off the bedpost, she was 
shaking all over. 

She pulled off her clothes quickly, tossing them onto the floor, and put on a 
nightshirt. Then she climbed under the covers, eager to get to sleep. 

But she couldn’t stop her mind from whirring over all that had happened. 
She couldn’t stop the frightening pictures from playing in her head, over and 
over. 

The shadows of tree limbs from the front yard shifted and bobbed across 
the ceiling. Normally, she found their silent dance soothing. But tonight the 
moving shadows frightened her, reminded her of the menacing dark figure that 
had called her name. 

She tried to think about Danny instead. But those thoughts were just as 
troubling. 

Danny is a ghost. Danny is a ghost. 

The phrase repeated again and again in her mind. 

He had to be lying about his mother, Hannah decided. He made up the story 
about her being deaf because he doesn’t want me to figure out that she’s a ghost, 
too. 

Questions, questions. 

Questions she couldn’t answer. 

If Danny is a ghost, what is he doing here? Why did he move in next door to 

me? 

Why does he hang out with Alan and Fred? Are they ghosts, too? 



Is that why I’ve never seen them at school or in town before? Is that why 
I’ve never seen any of them? They’re all ghosts? 

Hannah shut her eyes, trying to force all the questions from her mind. But 
she couldn’t stop thinking about Danny—and the dark shadow figure. 

Why did the dark figure tell me to stay away from Danny? Is it trying to 
keep me from proving that Danny is a ghost? 

Finally, Hannah fell asleep. But even in sleep, her troubled thoughts 
pursued her. 

The sinewy black shadow followed her into her dreams. In the dream, she 
was standing in a gray cave. A fire burned brightly, far in the distance at the 
mouth of the cave. 

The black figure, its red eyes glowing brighter than the fire, moved toward 
Hannah. Closer. And closer. 

And when the black figure came so close, close enough for Hannah to reach 
out and touch it, the shadow figure reached up with its sticklike arms and pulled 
itself apart. 

It reached up with its ebony hands and with bonelike fingers, pulled away 
the darkness where its face should be—revealing Danny underneath. 

Danny, leering at her with glowing red eyes that burned into hers—until she 
woke up gasping for breath. 

No, she thought, staring out the window at the gray dawn. No. Danny isn’t 
the black shadow. 

No way. 

It isn’t Danny. 

It can’t be Danny. The dream makes no sense. 

Hannah sat up. Her bedclothes were damp from perspiration. The air in the 
room hung heavy and sour. 

She kicked off the covers and lowered her feet to the floor. 

She knew only one thing for certain after her long night of frightening 
thoughts. 

She had to talk to Danny. 

She couldn’t spend another night like this. 

She had to find out the truth. 

The next morning, after breakfast, she saw him kicking a soccer ball around 
in his back yard. She pulled open the kitchen door and ran outside. The screen 
door slammed loudly behind her as she began to run to him. 



“Hey, Danny—” she called. “Are you a ghost?” 



18 


“Huh?” Danny glanced at her, then kicked the black-and-white soccer ball 
against the side of the garage. He was wearing a navy-blue T-shirt over denim 
shorts. He had a blue-and-red Cubs cap pulled down over his red hair. 

Hannah ran full speed across the driveway and stopped a few feet from him. 
“Are you a ghost?” she repeated breathlessly. 

He wrinkled his forehead, squinting at her. The ball bounced across the 
grass. He stepped forward and kicked it. “Yeah. Sure,” he said. 

“No. Really,” Hannah insisted, her heart pounding. 

The ball bounced high off the garage, and he caught it against his chest. 
“What did you say?” He scratched the back of a knee. 

He’s staring at me as if I’m nuts, Hannah realized. 

Maybe I am. 

“Never mind,” she said, swallowing hard. “Can I play?” 

“Yeah.” He dropped the ball to the grass. “How ya doing?” he asked. “You 
okay today?” 

Hannah nodded. “Yeah. I guess.” 

“That was pretty wild last night,” Danny said, kicking the ball gently to her. 
“I mean, at Mr. Chesney’s.” 

The ball got by Hannah. She chased after it and kicked it back. Normally, 
she was a good athlete. But this morning she was wearing sandals, not the best 
for kicking a soccer ball. 

“I really got scared,” Hannah admitted. “I thought that car that stopped was 
the police and—” 

“Yeah. It was kind of scary,” Danny said. He picked the ball up and hit it 
back to her with his head. 

“Do Alan and Fred really go to Maple Avenue School?” Hannah asked. The 
ball hit her ankle and rolled toward the driveway. 

“Yeah. They’re going to be in ninth grade,” Danny told her, waiting for her 
to kick the ball back. 

“They’re not new kids? How come I’ve never seen them?” She kicked the 
ball hard. 

Danny moved to his right to get behind it. He snickered. “How come 



they’ve never seen you?” 

He isn’t giving me any straight answers, Hannah realized. I think my 
questions are making him nervous. He knows I’m starting to suspect the truth 
about him. 

“Alan and Fred want to go back to Chesney’s,” Danny told her. 

“Huh? They what?” She missed the ball and kicked up a clod of grass. “Ow. 
I can’t play soccer in sandals!” 

“They want to go back tonight. You know. To pay Chesney back for scaring 
us. He really hurt my shoulder.” 

“I think Alan and Fred are really looking for trouble,” Hannah warned. 

Danny shrugged. “Nothing else to do in this town,” he muttered. 

The ball rolled between them. 

“I’ve got it!” they both yelled in unison. 

They both chased after the ball. Danny got to it first. He tried to kick it 
away from her. But his foot landed on top of the ball. He stumbled over it and 
went sprawling onto the grass. 

Hannah laughed and jumped over him to get to the ball. She kicked it 
against the side of the garage, then turned back to him, smiling triumphantly. 
“One for me!” she declared. 

He sat up slowly, grass stains smearing the chest of his T-shirt. “Help me 
up.” He reached up his hands to hers. 

Hannah reached to pull Danny up—and her hands went right through him! 



19 


They both uttered startled cries. 

“Hey, come on! Help me up,” Danny said. 

Her heart pounding, Hannah tried to grab his hands again. 

But again her hands went right through his. 

“Hey—!” Danny cried, his eyes wide with alarm. He jumped to his feet, 
staring at her hard. 

“I knew it,” Hannah said softly, raising her hands to her cheeks. She took a 
step back, away from him. 

“Knew it? Knew what?” He continued to stare at her, his face filled with 
confusion. “What’s going on, Hannah?” 

“Stop pretending,” Hannah told him, suddenly feeling cold all over despite 
the bright morning sunshine. “I know the truth, Danny. You’re a ghost.” 

“Huh?” His mouth dropped open in disbelief. He pulled off his Cubs cap 
and scratched his hair, staring hard at her all the while. 

“You’re a ghost,” she repeated, her voice trembling. 

“Me?” he cried. “No way! Are you crazy? I’m not a ghost!” 

Without warning, he stepped in front of her and shot his hand out at her 
chest. 

Hannah gasped as his hand went right through her body. 

She didn’t feel a thing. It was as if she weren’t there. 

Danny cried out and jerked his hand back as if he had burned it. He 
swallowed hard, his expression tight with horror. “Y-you—” he stammered. 

Hannah tried to reply, but the words caught in her throat. 

Giving her one last horrified glance, Danny turned and began running at 
full speed toward his house. 

Hannah stared helplessly after him until he disappeared through the back 
door. The door slammed hard behind him. 

Dazed, Hannah turned and began to run home. 

She felt dizzy. The ground seemed to spin beneath her. The blue sky 
shimmered and became blindingly bright. Her house tilted and swayed. 

“Danny’s not the ghost,” Hannah said out loud. “I finally know the truth. 



Danny’s not the ghost. I am!” 



20 


Hannah stepped up to the back door, then hesitated. 

I can’t go back in now, she thought. I have to think. 

Maybe I’ll take a walk or something. 

She closed her eyes, trying to force her dizziness away. When she opened 
them, everything seemed brighter, too bright to bear. 

Stepping carefully off the back stoop, she headed toward the front, her head 
spinning. 

I’m a ghost. 

I’m not a real person anymore. 

I’m a ghost. 

Voices broke into Hannah’s confused thoughts. Someone was approaching. 

She ducked out of sight behind the big maple tree and listened. 

“It’s a perfectly lovely house.” Hannah recognized Mrs. Quilty’s voice. 

“My cousin from Detroit looked at it last week,” another woman said. 
Hannah didn’t recognize her. Peering out from behind the tree trunk, Hannah 
saw that it was a thin, haggard-looking woman wearing a yellow sundress. She 
and Mrs. Quilty were standing halfway up the drive, admiring Hannah’s house. 

Afraid she might be seen, Hannah ducked back behind the tree. 

“Did your cousin like the house?” Mrs. Quilty asked her companion. 

“Too small,” was the curt reply. 

“What a shame,” Mrs. Quilty said with a loud sigh. “I just hate having an 
empty house on the block.” 

But it’s not empty! Hannah thought angrily. I live here! My whole family 
lives here—don’t we? 

“How long has it been vacant?” the other woman asked. 

“Ever since it was rebuilt,” Hannah heard Mrs. Quilty reply. “You know. 
After that dreadful fire. I guess it was five years ago.” 

“Fire?” Mrs. Quilty’s friend asked. “That was before I moved here. Did the 
whole house burn down?” 

“Pretty much,” Mrs. Quilty told her. “It was so dreadful, Beth. Such a 
tragedy. The family trapped inside. Such a beautiful family. A young girl. Two 



little boys. They all died that night.” 

My dream! Hannah thought, gripping the tree trunk to hold herself up. It 
wasn’t a dream. It was a real fire. I really died that night. 

Tears streamed down Hannah’s face. Her legs felt weak and trembly. She 
leaned against the rough bark of the tree and listened. 

“How did it happen?” Beth, Mrs. Quilty’s friend, asked. “Do they know 
what started the fire?” 

“Yes. The kids had some kind of campfire out back. Behind the garage,” 
Mrs. Quilty continued. “When they went inside, they didn’t put it out 
completely. The house caught fire after they’d gone to sleep. It spread so 
quickly.” 

Hannah saw the two women peering thoughtfully at the house from their 
position on the driveway. They were shaking their heads. 

“The house was gutted, then completely rebuilt,” Mrs. Quilty was saying. 
“But no one ever moved in. It’s been five years. Can you imagine?” 

I’ve been dead for five years, Hannah thought, letting the tears roll down 
her cheeks. No wonder I didn’t know Danny or his friends. 

No wonder I haven’t gotten any letters from Janey. No wonder I haven’t 
heard from any of my friends. 

I’ve been dead for five years. 

Now, Hannah understood why sometimes time seemed to stand still, and 
sometimes it floated by so quickly. 

Ghosts come and go, she thought sadly. Sometimes I’m solid enough to ride 
a bike or kick a soccer ball. And sometimes I’m so flimsy, someone’s hand goes 
right through me. 

Hannah watched the two women make their way down the block until they 
disappeared from view. Clinging to the tree trunk, she made no attempt to move. 

It was all beginning to make sense to Hannah. The dreamlike summer days. 
The loneliness. The feeling that something wasn’t right. 

But what about Mom and Dad? she asked herself, pushing herself away 
from the tree. What about the twins? Do they know ? Do they know that we’re all 
ghosts? 

“Mom!” she shouted, running to the front door. “Mom!” 

She burst into the house and ran through the hall to the kitchen. “Mom! 
Mom! Where are you? Bill? Herb?” 

Silence. 



No one there. 

They were all gone. 



21 


“Where are you?” Hannah cried aloud. “Mom! Bill! Herb!” 

Were they gone forever ? 

We’re all ghosts, she thought miserably. All. 

And now they’ve left me here by myself. 

Her heart pounding, she gazed around the kitchen. 

It was bare. Empty. 

No cereal boxes on the counter where they were usually kept. No funny 
magnets on the refrigerator. No curtains on the window. No clock on the wall. 
No kitchen table. 

“Where are you?” Hannah called desperately. 

She pushed away from the counter and went running through the house. 

All empty. All bare. 

No clothing. No furniture. No lamps or posters on the wall or books in the 
bookshelves. 

Gone. Everything gone. 

They’ve left me here. A ghost. A ghost all by myself. 

“I’ve got to talk to someone,” she said aloud. “Anyone!” 

She searched desperately for a telephone until she found a red one on the 
bare kitchen wall. 

Who can I call ? Who ? 

No one. 

I’m dead. 

I’ve been dead for five years. 

She picked up the receiver and brought it to her ear. 

Silence. The phone was dead, too. 

With a hopeless cry, Hannah let the receiver fall to the floor. Her heart 
thudding, tears once again rolling down her cheeks, she flung herself down onto 
the bare floor. 

Sobbing softly to herself, she buried her head in her arms and let the 
darkness sweep over her. 



When she opened her eyes, the darkness remained. 

She pulled herself up, not sure at first where she was. Feeling shaky and 
tense, she raised her eyes to the kitchen window. Outside, the sky was blue- 
black. 

Night. 

Time floats in and out when you’re a ghost, Hannah realized. That’s why 
the summer has seemed so short and so endless at the same time. She stretched 
her arms toward the ceiling, then wandered from the kitchen. 

“Anyone home?” she called. 

She wasn’t surprised by the silence that greeted her question. 

Her family was gone. 

But where? 

As she made her way through the dark, empty hallway toward the front of 
the house, she had another premonition. Another feeling of dread. 

Something bad was going to happen. 

Now? Tonight? 

She stopped at the open front door and peered through the screen door. 
“Hey—!” Danny was on his bike, pedaling slowly down his driveway. 

Impulsively, Hannah pushed open the screen door and ran outside. “Hey— 
Danny!” 

He slowed his bike and turned to her. 

“Danny—wait!” she called, running across her yard toward him. 

“No—please!” His face filled with fright. He raised both hands as if to 
shield himself. 

“Danny—?” 

“Go away!” he screamed, his voice shrill from terror. “Please—stay 
away! ” He gripped the handlebars and began pedaling furiously away. 

Hannah jumped back, stunned and hurt. “Don’t be afraid of me!” she 
shouted after him, cupping her hands around her mouth to be heard. “Danny, 
please—don’t be afraid!” 

Leaning over the handlebars, he rode away without looking back. 

Hannah uttered a hurt cry. 

As Danny disappeared down the block, the feeling of dread swept over her. 

I know where he’s going, she thought. 

He’s meeting Alan and Fred, and they’re going to Mr. Chesney’s house. 
They’re going to get their revenge on Mr. Chesney. 



And something very bad is going to happen. 

I’m going there, too, Hannah decided. 

I have to go, too. 

She hurried to the garage to get her bike. 

Mr. Chesney had repaired his mailbox, Hannah saw. The hand-carved swan 
wings floated out from the pole, which had been returned to its erect position. 

Crouching behind the same low evergreen, Hannah watched the three boys 
across the street. They hesitated at the edge of Mr. Chesney’s yard, hidden from 
the house by the tall hedge. 

In the pale white light of the streetlamp, Hannah could see them grinning 
and joking. Then she saw Fred shove Danny toward the mailbox. 

Hannah raised her gaze beyond the hedge to Mr. Chesney’s small house. 
Orange light glowed dimly from the living room window. The porch-light was 
on. The rest of the house sat in darkness. 

Was Mr. Chesney home? Hannah couldn’t tell. 

His beat-up old Plymouth wasn’t in the driveway. 

Hannah crouched behind the evergreen. Its prickly branches bobbed in a 
light breeze. 

She watched Danny struggle to pull up the mailbox. Alan and Fred were 
standing behind him, urging him on. 

Danny gripped both jutting wings and pulled. 

Fred slapped him on the back. “Harder!” he cried. 

“What a wimp!” Alan declared, laughing. 

Hannah kept glancing nervously up to the house. The boys were so noisy. 
What made them so sure that Mr. Chesney wasn’t home? 

What made them so sure that Chesney wouldn’t keep his promise and come 
after them with his shotgun? 

Hannah shuddered. She felt a trickle of perspiration slide down her 
forehead. 

She watched Danny tug furiously at the mailbox. With a hard pull, he tilted 
it at an angle. 

Fred and Alan cheered gleefully. 

Danny began to rock the mailbox, pushing it with his shoulder, then pulling 
it back. It was coming loose, tilting farther with each push, each pull. 

Hannah heard Danny’s loud groan as he gave it a final strong push—and 



the mailbox fell onto its side on the ground. He backed away, a triumphant smile 
on his face. 

Fred and Alan cheered again and slapped him high-fives. 

Fred picked up the mailbox, hoisted it on his shoulder, and paraded back 
and forth in front of the hedge with it, as if it were an enemy flag. 

As they celebrated their triumph, Hannah again glanced over the hedge to 
the dimly lit house. 

No sign of Mr. Chesney. 

Maybe he wasn’t home. Maybe the boys would get away without getting 
caught. 

But why did Hannah still have the heavy feeling of dread weighing her 
down, chilling her body? 

She gasped as she saw a shadow slide past the corner of the house. 

Mr. Chesney? 

No. 

Squinting hard into the dim light, Hannah felt her heart begin to thud 
against her chest. 

No one there. But what was that shadow? 

She had definitely seen it, a shape darker than the long night shadows, 
slithering against the grayness of the house. 

The boys’ loud voices interrupted her thoughts, drawing her attention away 
from the house. 

Fred had tossed the mailbox into the hedge. Now they had moved toward 
the driveway. They were discussing something, arguing loudly. Alan laughed. 
Fred gave Alan a playful shove. Danny was saying something, but Hannah 
couldn’t hear his words. 

Get away, Hannah urged them in her mind. Get away from there. You pulled 
your stupid prank, had your stupid revenge. 

Now get away—before you get caught. 

The evergreen limbs bobbed silently in a gust of hot wind. Hannah stepped 
back into the darkness, her eyes on the boys. 

They were huddled together at the bottom of the driveway. They were 
talking excitedly, all three at once. Then Hannah saw a flicker of light. It glowed 
for a moment, then went out. 

It was a match, Hannah realized. 

Alan was holding a large box of kitchen matches. 



Hannah glanced nervously at the house. All was still. No Mr. Chesney. No 
shadows slithering across the wall. 

Go home. Please, go home, she silently urged the boys. 

But to her dismay, they turned and began jogging up the gravel driveway. 
They ducked low as they ran, trying not to be seen from the house. 

What are they doing? Hannah wondered, feeling all of her muscles tighten 
in dread. A shiver of fear ran down her back as she stepped out from behind the 
evergreen. 

What are they going to do? 

She made her way quickly across the street and ducked in front of the 
hedge, her heart pounding. 

She couldn’t hear them. They must be nearly up to the house by now. 

Should she follow them? 

She stood up slowly and raised herself on tiptoes to see over the hedge. 

The three boys, Alan in the lead, followed by Danny and Fred, were bent 
low, running rapidly across the front of the house. Caught in the dim orange 
glow of light from the window, Hannah could see their determined expressions. 

Where are they going? What are they planning? 

Hannah watched them run into the darkness around the side of the house. 

Still no sign of Mr. Chesney. 

Keeping close to the hedge, Hannah made her way to the driveway. Then, 
without thinking about it, without even realizing it, she was running, too. 

She stopped short as she saw Alan shoving Danny up into an open window. 
Then Fred stepped forward, lifted his hands to the window ledge, and allowed 
Alan to give him a boost. 

No — please! Hannah wanted to cry. 

Don’t go into the house! Don ’t go in there! 

But she was too late. 

All three of them had climbed into the house. 

Breathing hard, Hannah began to creep toward the window. 

But halfway there, she felt something grab her leg and hold her in place. 



22 


Hannah uttered a silent cry. 

She struggled to free her leg—and quickly realized she had stepped into a 
coiled garden hose. 

Exhaling loudly, she lifted her foot out of it and crept the rest of the way to 
the open window. 

This side of the house was covered in darkness. The window was too high 
for Hannah to see into the room. 

Standing beneath the window, Hannah could hear the boys’ sneakers 
thudding on bare floorboards. She could hear whispering voices and high- 
pitched, muffled laughter. 

What are they doing in there? she wondered, her entire body tight with fear. 

Don’t they realize how much trouble they could get into? 

Bright lights against the side of the house made Hannah jump back with a 
startled cry. 

She dropped to the ground and spun around. And saw headlights through 
the tall hedge. Car headlights floating toward the driveway. 

Mr. Chesney? 

Was he returning home? Returning home in time to catch the three intruders 
in his house? 

Hannah opened her mouth to call out a warning to the boys. But her voice 
caught in her throat. 

The headlights floated past. The darkness rolled back over the yard. 

The car rumbled silently on. 

It wasn’t Mr. Chesney, Hannah realized. 

She struggled to her feet and returned to her place below the window. She 
decided she had to let the boys know she was there. She had to get them out of 
there! 

“Danny!” she called, wrapping her hands around her mouth as a 
megaphone. “Get out! Come on—get out now!” 

The feeling of dread weighed her down. She shouted up to the window 
again. “Come out. Hurry—please!” 

She could hear their muffled voices inside. And she could hear the scrape of 



sneakers on the floor. 

Staring up at the window, she saw a light come on. Orange light, dim at 
first, then brighter. 

“Are you crazy?” she shouted in to them. “Turn off the lights!” 

Why on earth were they turning on lights? 

Did they want to get caught? 

“Turn off the lights!” she repeated in a high, shrill, frightened voice. 

But the orange light grew brighter, became a bright yellow. 

And as she stared in horror, Hannah realized the light was flickering. 

Not lamp light. 

Fire light. 

Fire! 

They had set a fire! 

“No!” she screamed, raising her hands to the sides of her face. “No! Get 
out! Get out of there!” 

She could smell smoke now. She could see the reflection of the leaping 
flames in the window glass. 

She started to shout to them again—but stopped when she saw the shadow 
move toward her on the wall of the house. 

Hannah stopped and turned her stare. 

And saw the dark figure, blacker than the night, its red eyes glowing 
brightly from the blackness of its face. 

It stepped silently toward her, floating rapidly over the tall, weed-strewn 
grass. Its red eyes appeared to light up as it neared. 

“Hannah—stay away!” the moving shadow called in a voice as dry as dead 
leaves. 

“Hannah—stay away.” 

“Nooooo!” Hannah uttered a frightened wail as it moved toward her. A 
burst of frigid air encircled her body. “Noooo!” 

“Hannah... Hannah...” 

“Who are you?” she demanded. “What do you want?” 

Behind her, she could hear the crackle of flames now. Yellow light flickered 
behind choking waves of black smoke from the open window. 

Its fiery eyes glowing brighter, the shadow figure raised itself up, hovered 
closer, closer, stretching out its arms, preparing to pull her in. 



23 


Gripped with fear, Hannah raised her hands in front of her as if trying to shield 
herself. 

She heard a sudden scrabbling at the window. A muffled cry above her 

head. 

The shadow figure vanished. 

And then she felt someone topple onto her. 

They both fell in a heap to the ground. 

“Alan!” she cried. 

He struggled to his feet, his eyes wide with panic. “The matches!” he cried. 
“The matches! We—we didn’t mean to. We—” 

Another figure came diving out of the window as the crackle of flames 
grew to a roar. Fred landed hard on his elbows and knees. 

Hannah stared at his dazed face in the darting orange light. “Fred—are you 
okay?” 

“Danny,” he muttered, gazing at her with horror. “Danny’s in there. He 
can’t get out.” 

“Huh?” Hannah leapt to her feet. 

“Danny’s trapped in the fire. He’s going to burn!” Alan cried. 

“We have to get help!” Fred said, shouting over the roar of the flames. He 
pulled Alan by the arm. The two boys took off, running unsteadily across the 
yard toward the house next door. 

Bright orange-and-yellow flames licked at the windowsill above Hannah’s 
head. 

I have to save Danny, she thought. 

She took a deep breath, gazing up at the flickering, flashing light of the fire. 
Then she started toward the open window. 

But before she could take a step, the light from the window disappeared. 
The shadow rose in front of her. 

“Hannah—go away.” Its frightening, harsh whisper was so close to her 
face. “Go away.” 

“No!” Hannah screamed, forgetting her fear. “I have to save Danny.” 
“Hannah... you will not save him!” came the raspy reply. 



The dark figure, eyes afire, hovered over her, blocking Hannah’s path to the 
window. 

“Let me go!” she screamed. “I have to save him!” 

The red eyes loomed closer. The darkness fell heavier around her. 

“Who are you?” Hannah shrieked. “What are you? What do you want?” 

The dark figure didn’t reply. The glowing eyes burned into hers. 

Danny is trapped in there, Hannah thought. I have to get in that window. 

“Move out of my way! ” she screamed. And in her desperation, she reached 
out with both hands—grabbed the dark figure by the shoulders—and tried to 
shove it out of the way. 

To Hannah’s shock, the figure felt solid. With a determined cry, she raised 
her hands to its face—and tugged. 

The darkness that cloaked its face fell away—and beneath the darkness, 
Danny’s face was revealed! 



24 


Hannah stared in horror and disbelief, struggling to breathe. The sour odor 
choked her. The darkness continued to wrap around her, holding her prisoner. 

Danny grinned back at her, with the same glowing red eyes as before he’d 
been unmasked. 

“No!” Hannah cried, her voice a hoarse whisper, tight with fear. “It isn’t 
you, Danny. It isn’t!” 

A cruel smile played over the figure’s glowing face. “I am Danny’s ghost!” 
he declared. 

“Ghost?” Hannah tried to pull back. But the darkness held her tightly. 

“I am Danny’s ghost. When he dies in the fire, I will no longer be a shadow. 
I will be BORN—and Danny will go to the shadow world in my place!” 

“No! No!” Hannah shrieked, raising her fists in front of her. “No! Danny 
will not die! I won’t let him!” 

Danny’s ghost opened its mouth and uttered a foul-smelling laugh. “You’re 
too late, Hannah!” he sneered. “Too late.” 



25 


“Nooooooo!” 

Hannah’s wail echoed in the darkness that surrounded her. 

The ghost-Danny’s red eyes flared angrily as Hannah burst right through 

him. 

A second later, she was raising her hands to the window ledge. “Oh!” The 
sill was hot from the fire. 

Using all her strength, she pulled herself up toward the darting flames—and 
into the house. A curtain of thick, sour smoke rose up to greet her. 

Ignoring the smoke and the bright wall of fire, Hannah lowered herself 
heavily onto the floor. 

I’m a ghost, she told herself, stepping into the blazing room. 

I’m a ghost. I can’t die again. 

She rubbed her eyes with the sleeve of her T-shirt, struggling to see. 
“Danny?” she called, shouting as loudly as she could. “Danny—I can’t see you! 
Where are you?” 

Shielding her eyes with one hand, Hannah took another step into the room. 
Flames shot up like bright geysers. Wallpaper on one wall had curled down, the 
blackened corner covered with leaping flames. 

“Danny—where are you?” 

She heard a muffled shout from the next room. Dashing through the flame- 
encircled doorway, she saw him—trapped behind a tall wall of flames. 
“Danny—!” 

He was backed into a corner, his hands raised together in front of him, 
shielding his face from the smoke. 

I can’t get through those thick flames, Hannah realized to her horror. 

She took another step into the room, then held back. 

No way. 

No way I can save him. 

But once again, she reminded herself: I am a ghost. I can do things that 
living people cannot do. 

“Help me! Help me!” 



Danny’s voice sounded tiny and far away behind the leaping waves of 
flame. 

Without another second’s hesitation, Hannah sucked in a deep breath, held 
it—and leapt into the flames. 

“Help me!” He stared at her, his eyes blank. He didn’t seem to see her. 
“Help!” 

“Come on!” She grabbed his hand and tugged. “Let’s go!” 

The flames bent toward them, like fiery arms reaching to grab them. 

“Come on!” 

She tugged again, but he held back. “We can’t make it!” 

“Yes—we have to!” she shouted. 

The heat burned her nostrils. She shut her eyes against the blinding yellow 
brightness. “We have to!” 

She grabbed his hand with both of hers and pulled. 

Black smoke swirled around them. Choking, she shut her eyes and pulled 
him, pulled him into the searing, blistering heat of the flames. 

Into the flames. 

Through them. 

Coughing and choking. Dripping with perspiration from the furnacelike 

heat. 

Pulled him. Pulled blindly. Pulled with all her might. 

She didn’t open her eyes until they were at the window. 

She didn’t breathe until they had tumbled to the cool darkness of the 
ground. 

Then, on her hands and knees, panting so loudly, gasping for clean air, she 
gazed up. 

There was the shadow figure near the house, twisting in flames. As the fire 
consumed it, it raised its dark arms toward the sky—and vanished without 
making a sound. 

With a relieved sigh, Hannah lowered her gaze to Danny. 

He was lying sprawled on his back, a dazed expression on his face. 
“Hannah,” he whispered hoarsely. “Hannah, thanks.” 

She felt a smile start to cross her face. 

Everything turned bright, as bright as the wall of flames. 

Then everything went black.

Danny’s mother leaned over him, pulling the light blanket up to his chest. “How 
are you feeling?” she asked softly. 

It was two hours later. Danny had been treated by the paramedics who 
arrived shortly after the firefighters. They told his worried mother that he was 
suffering from smoke inhalation and had a few minor burns. 

After treating the burns, they drove Danny and Mrs. Anderson home in an 
ambulance. 

Now Danny lay in bed, staring up at her, still feeling groggy and dazed. 
Mrs. Quilty stood anxiously in the corner, her arms clasped tensely in front of 
her, looking on in silence. She had hurried over to see what the commotion was. 

“I—I’m okay, I guess,” Danny said, pulling himself up a bit on the pillow. 
“I’m just a little tired.” 

His mother pushed a lock of blond hair off her forehead as she stared down 
at him, reading his lips. “How did you ever get out? How did you get out of the 
house?” 

“It was Hannah,” Danny told her. “Hannah pulled me out.” 

“Who?” Mrs. Anderson knotted her face in confusion. “Who is Hannah?” 

“You know,” Danny replied impatiently. “The girl next door.” 

“There’s no girl next door,” his mother said. “Is there, Molly?” She turned 
to read Mrs. Quilty’s lips. 

Mrs. Quilty shook her head. “The house is empty.” 

Danny sat up straight. “Her name is Hannah Fairchild. She saved my life, 
Mom.” 

Mrs. Quilty tsk-tsked sympathetically. “Hannah Fairchild is the girl who 
died five years ago,” she said quietly. “Poor Danny is a bit delirious, I’m afraid.” 

“Just lie back,” Danny’s mother said, gently pushing him back onto the 
pillow. “Get some rest. You’ll be fine.” 

“But where is Hannah? Hannah is my friend!” Danny insisted. 

Hannah watched the scene from the doorway. 

The three people in the room couldn’t see her, she realized. 

She had saved Danny’s life, and now the room and the people in it were 
growing faint, fading to gray. 



Maybe that’s why my family and I came back after five years, Hannah 
thought. Maybe we came back to save Danny from dying in a fire as we did. 

“Hannah... Hannah...” A voice called to her. A sweet, familiar voice from 
far away. 

“Is that you, Mom?” Hannah called. 

“Time to come back,” Mrs. Fairchild whispered. “You must leave now, 
Hannah. It’s time to come back.” 

“Okay, Mom.” 

She gazed into the bedroom at Danny, lying peacefully on his pillow. He 
was fading away now, fading to gray. 

Hannah squinted into the solid grayness. The house, she knew, was fading. 
The earth was fading from her sight. 

“Come back, Hannah,” her mother whispered. “Come back to us now.” 

Hannah could feel herself floating now. And as she floated, she gazed down 
—her last look at earth. 

“I can see him, Mom,” she said excitedly, brushing the tears off her cheeks. 
“I can see Danny. In his room. But the light is getting faint. So faint.” 

“Hannah, come back. Come back to us,” her mother whispered, calling her 
home. 

“Danny—remember me!” Hannah cried, as Danny’s face appeared clearly 
in the misty gray. Could he hear her? Could he hear her calling to him? She 
hoped so. 





THE HAUNTED MASK 
Goosebumps - 11

“What are you going to be for Halloween?” Sabrina Mason asked. She moved 
her fork around in the bright yellow macaroni on her lunch tray, but didn’t take a 
bite. 

Carly Beth Caldwell sighed and shook her head. The overhead light on the 
lunchroom ceiling made her straight brown hair gleam. “I don’t know. A witch, 
maybe.” 

Sabrina’s mouth dropped open. “You? A witch?” 

“Well, why not?” Carly Beth demanded, staring across the long table at her 
friend. 

“I thought you were afraid of witches,” Sabrina replied. She raised a forkful 
of macaroni to her mouth and started to chew. “This macaroni is made of 
rubber,” she complained, chewing hard. “Remind me to start packing a lunch.” 

“I am not afraid of witches!” Carly Beth insisted, her dark eyes flashing 
angrily. “You just think I’m a big scaredy-cat, don’t you?” 

Sabrina giggled. “Yes.” She flipped her black ponytail behind her shoulders 
with a quick toss of her head. “Hey, don’t eat the macaroni. Really, Carly Beth. 
It’s gross.” She reached across the table to keep Carly Beth from raising her fork. 

“But I’m starving !” Carly Beth complained. 

The lunchroom grew crowded and noisy. At the next table, a group of fifth- 
grade boys were tossing a half-full milk carton back and forth. Carly Beth saw 
Chuck Greene ball up a bright red fruit rollup and shove the whole sticky thing 
in his mouth. 

“Yuck!” She made a disgusted face at him. Then she turned back to 
Sabrina. “I am not a scaredy-cat, Sabrina. Just because everyone picks on me 
and—” 

“Carly Beth, what about last week? Remember? At my house?” Sabrina 
ripped open a bag of tortilla chips and offered some across the table to her 
friend. 

“You mean the ghost thing?” Carly Beth replied, frowning. “That was really 
stupid.” 

“But you believed it,” Sabrina said with a mouthful of chips. “You really 
believed my attic was haunted. You should have seen the look on your face when 



the ceiling started to creak, and we heard the footsteps up there.” 

“That was so mean,” Carly Beth complained, rolling her eyes. 

“Then when you heard footsteps coming down the stairs, your face went all 
white and you screamed,” Sabrina recalled. “It was only Chuck and Steve.” 

“You know I’m afraid of ghosts,” Carly Beth said, blushing. 

“And snakes and bugs and loud noises and dark rooms and—and witches!” 
Sabrina declared. 

“I don’t see why you have to make fun of me,” Carly Beth pouted. She 
shoved her lunch tray away. “I don’t see why everyone always thinks it’s so 
much fun to try to scare me. Even you, my best friend.” 

“I’m sorry,” Sabrina said sincerely. She reached across the table and 
squeezed Carly Beth’s wrist reassuringly. “You’re just so easy to scare. It’s hard 
to resist. Here. Want some more chips?” She shoved the bag toward Carly Beth. 

“Maybe I’ll scare you some day,” Carly Beth threatened. 

Her friend laughed. “No way!” 

Carly Beth continued to pout. She was eleven. But she was tiny. And with 
her round face and short stub of a nose (which she hated and wished would grow 
longer), she looked much younger. 

Sabrina, on the other hand, was tall, dark, and sophisticated-looking. She 
had straight black hair tied behind her head in a ponytail, and enormous, dark 
eyes. Everyone who saw them together assumed that Sabrina was twelve or 
thirteen. But, actually, Carly Beth was a month older than her friend. 

“Maybe I won’t be a witch,” Carly Beth said thoughtfully, resting her chin 
on her hands. “Maybe I’ll be a disgusting monster with hanging eyeballs and 
green slime dripping down my face and—” 

A loud crash made Carly Beth scream. 

It took her a few seconds to realize that it was just a lunch tray hitting the 
floor. She turned to see Gabe Moser, his face bright red, drop to his knees and 
start scooping his lunch off the floor. The lunchroom rang out with cheers and 
applause. 

Carly Beth hunched down in her seat, embarrassed that she had screamed. 

Her breathing had just returned to normal when a strong hand grabbed her 
shoulder from behind. 

Carly Beth’s shriek echoed through the room. 



2 


She heard laughter. At another table, someone yelled, “Way to go, Steve!” 

She whipped her head around to see her friend Steve Boswell standing 
behind her, a mischievous grin on his face. “Gotcha,” he said, letting go of her 
shoulder. 

Steve pulled out the chair next to Carly Beth’s and lowered himself over its 
back. His best friend, Chuck Greene, slammed his bookbag onto the table and 
then sat down next to Sabrina. 

Steve and Chuck looked so much alike, they could have been brothers. Both 
were tall and thin, with straight brown hair, which they usually hid under 
baseball caps. Both had dark brown eyes and goofy grins. Both wore faded blue 
jeans and dark-colored, long-sleeved T-shirts. 

And both of them loved to scare Carly Beth. They loved to startle her, to 
make her jump and shriek. 

They spent hours dreaming up new ways to frighten her. 

She vowed every time that she would never— never —fall for one of their 
stupid tricks again. 

But so far, they had won every time. 

Carly Beth always threatened to pay them back. But in all the time they’d 
been friends, she hadn’t been able to think of anything good enough. 

Chuck reached for the few remaining chips in Sabrina’s bag. She playfully 
slapped his hand away. “Get your own.” 

Steve held a crinkled hunk of aluminum foil under Carly Beth’s nose. 
“Want a sandwich? I don’t want it.” 

Carly Beth sniffed it suspiciously. “What kind is it? I’m starving !” 

“It’s a turkey sandwich. Here,” Steve said, handing it to Carly Beth. “It’s 
too dry. My mom forgot the mayo. You want it?” 

“Yeah, sure. Thanks!” Carly Beth exclaimed. She took the sandwich from 
him and peeled back the aluminum foil. Then she took a big bite of the 
sandwich. 

As she started to chew, she realized that both Steve and Chuck were staring 
at her with big grins on their faces. 

Something tasted funny. Kind of sticky and sour. 



Carly Beth stopped chewing. 

Chuck and Steve were laughing now. Sabrina looked confused. 

Carly Beth uttered a disgusted groan and spit the chewed-up sandwich hunk 
into a napkin. Then she pulled the bread apart—and saw a big brown worm 
resting on top of the turkey. 

“Ohh!” With a moan, she covered her face with her hands. 

The room erupted with laughter. Cruel laughter. 

“I ate a worm. I-I’m going to be sick!” Carly Beth groaned. She jumped to 
her feet and stared angrily at Steve. “How could you?” she demanded. “It isn’t 
funny. It’s—it’s—” 

“It isn’t a real worm,” Chuck said. Steve was laughing too hard to talk. 

“Huh?” Carly Beth gazed down at it and felt a wave of nausea rise up from 
her stomach. 

“It isn’t real. It’s rubber. Pick it up,” Chuck urged. 

Carly Beth hesitated. 

Kids all through the vast room were whispering and pointing at her. And 
laughing. 

“Go ahead. It isn’t real. Pick it up,” Chuck said, grinning. 

Carly Beth reached down with two fingers and reluctantly picked the brown 
worm from the sandwich. It felt warm and sticky. 

“Gotcha again!” Chuck said with a laugh. 

It was real! A real worm! 

With a horrified cry, Carly Beth tossed the worm at Chuck, who was 
laughing wildly. Then she leapt away from the table, knocking the chair over. As 
the chair clattered noisily against the hard floor, Carly Beth covered her mouth 
and ran gagging from the lunchroom. 

I can still taste it! she thought. 

I can still taste the worm in my mouth! 

I’ll pay them back for this, Carly Beth thought bitterly as she ran. 

I’ll pay them back. I really will. 

As she pushed through the double doors and hurtled toward the girls’ room, 
the cruel laughter followed her across the hall. 



3 


After school, Carly Beth hurried through the halls without talking to anyone. She 
heard kids laughing and whispering. She knew they were laughing at her. 

Word had spread all over school that Carly Beth Caldwell had eaten a worm 
at lunch. 

Carly Beth, the scaredy-cat. Carly Beth, who was frightened of her own 
shadow. Carly Beth, who was so easy to trick. 

Chuck and Steve had sneaked a real worm, a fat brown worm, into a 
sandwich. And Carly Beth had taken a big bite. 

What a jerk! 

Carly Beth ran all the way home, three long blocks. Her anger grew with 
every step. 

How could they do that to me? They’re supposed to be my friends! 

Why do they think it’s so funny to scare me? 

She burst into the house, breathing hard. “Anybody home?” she called, 
stopping in the hallway and leaning against the banister to catch her breath. 

Her mother hurried out from the kitchen. “Carly Beth! Hi! What’s wrong?” 

“I ran all the way,” Carly Beth told her, pulling off her blue windbreaker. 

“Why?” Mrs. Caldwell asked. 

“Just felt like it,” Carly Beth replied moodily. 

Her mother took Carly Beth’s windbreaker and hung it in the front closet 
for her. Then she brushed a hand affectionately through Carly Beth’s soft brown 
hair. “Where’d you get the straight hair?” she muttered. Her mother was always 
saying that. 

We don’t look like mother and daughter at all, Carly Beth realized. Her 
mother was a tall, chubby woman with thick curls of coppery hair, and lively 
gray-green eyes. She was extremely energetic, seldom stood still, and talked as 
rapidly as she moved. 

Today she was wearing a paint-stained gray sweatshirt over black Lycra 
tights. “Why so grumpy?” Mrs. Caldwell asked. “Anything you’d care to talk 
about?” 

Carly Beth shook her head. “Not really.” She didn’t feel like telling her 
mother that she had become the laughingstock of Walnut Avenue Middle School. 



“Come here. I have something to show you,” 

Mrs. Caldwell said, tugging Carly Beth toward the living room. 

“I—I’m really not in the mood, Mom,” Carly Beth told her, hanging back. 
“I just—” 

“Come on!” her mother insisted, and pulled her across the hallway. Carly 
Beth always found it impossible to argue with her mother. She was like a 
hurricane, sweeping everything in her direction. 

“Look!” Mrs. Caldwell declared, grinning and gesturing to the mantelpiece. 

Carly Beth followed her mother’s gaze to the mantel—and cried out in 
surprise. “It’s—a head!” 

“Not just any head,” Mrs. Caldwell said, beaming. “Go on. Take a closer 
look.” 

Carly Beth took a few steps toward the mantelpiece, her eyes on the head 
staring back at her. It took her a few moments to recognize the straight, brown 
hair, the brown eyes, the short snip of a nose, the round cheeks. “It’s me!” she 
cried, walking up to it. 

“Yes. Life size!” Mrs. Caldwell declared. “I just came from my art class at 
the museum. I finished it today. What do you think?” 

Carly Beth picked it up and studied it closely. “It looks just like me, Mom. 
Really. What’s it made of?” 

“Plaster of Paris,” her mother replied, taking it from Carly Beth and holding 
it up so that Carly Beth was face to face, eye to eye with herself. “You have to be 
careful. It’s delicate. It’s hollow, see?” 

Carly Beth stared intently at the head, peering into her own eyes. “It—it’s 
kind of creepy,” she muttered. 

“You mean because I did such a good job?” her mother demanded. 

“It’s just creepy, that’s all,” Carly Beth said. She forced herself to look 
away from the replica of herself, and saw that her mother’s smile had faded. 

Mrs. Caldwell looked hurt. “Don’t you like it?” 

“Yeah. Sure. It’s really good, Mom,” Carly Beth answered quickly. “But, I 
mean, why on earth did you make it?” 

“Because I love you,” Mrs. Caldwell replied curtly. “Why else? Honestly, 
Carly Beth, you have the strangest reactions to things. I worked really hard on 
this sculpture. I thought—” 

“I’m sorry, Mom. I like it. Really, I do,” Carly Beth insisted. “It was just a 
surprise, that’s all. It’s great. It looks just like me. I—I had a bad day, that’s all.” 



Carly Beth took another long look at the sculpture. Its brown eyes —her 
brown eyes—stared back at her. The brown hair shimmered in the afternoon 
sunlight through the window. 

It smiled at me! Carly Beth thought, her mouth dropping open. I saw it! I 
just saw it smile! 

No. It had to be a trick of the light. 

It was a plaster of Paris head, she reminded herself. 

Don’t go scaring yourself over nothing, Carly Beth. Haven’t you made a 
big enough fool of yourself today? 

“Thanks for showing it to me, Mom,” she said awkwardly, pulling her eyes 
away. She forced a smile. “Two heads are better than one, right?” 

“Right,” Mrs. Caldwell agreed brightly. “Incidentally, Carly Beth, your 
duck costume is all ready. I put it on your bed.” 

“Huh? Duck costume?” 

“You saw a duck costume at the mall, remember?” Mrs. Caldwell carefully 
placed the sculpted head on the mantel. “The one with all the feathers and 
everything. You thought it would be funny to be a duck this Halloween? So I 
made you a duck costume.” 

“Oh. Right,” Carly Beth said, her mind spinning. Do I really want to be a 
stupid duck this Halloween? she thought. “I’ll go up and take a look at it, Mom. 
Thanks.” 

Carly Beth had forgotten all about the duck costume. I don’t want to be cute 
this Halloween, she thought as she climbed the stairs to her room. I want to be 
scary. 

She had seen some really scary-looking masks in the window of a new 
party store that had opened a few blocks from school. One of them, she knew, 
would be perfect. 

But now she’d have to walk around in feathers and have everyone quack at 
her and make fun of her. 

It wasn’t fair. Why did her mother have to listen to every word she said? 

Just because Carly Beth had admired a duck costume in a store didn’t mean 
she wanted to be a stupid duck for Halloween! 

Carly Beth hesitated outside her bedroom. The door had been pulled closed 
for some reason. She never closed the door. 

She listened carefully. She thought she heard someone breathing on the 
other side of the door. Someone or something. 



The breathing grew louder. 

Carly Beth pressed an ear to the door. 

What was in her room? 

There was only one way to find out. 

Carly Beth pulled open the door—and uttered a startled cry. 



4 


“QUAAAAAAACCCK! ” 

With a hideous cry, an enormous white-feathered duck, its eyes wild and 
frenzied, leapt at Carly Beth. 

As she staggered backwards in astonishment, the duck knocked her over 
and pinned her to the hallway floor. 

“QUAAACCCK! QUAAAACK!” 

The costume has come alive! 

That was Carly Beth’s first frightened thought. 

Then she quickly realized the truth. “Noah—get off me!” she demanded, 
trying to push the big duck off her chest. 

The white feathers brushed against her nose. “Hey—that tickles!” 

She sneezed. 

“Noah—come on!” 

“QUAAAAACCCK! ” 

“Noah, I mean it!” she told her eight-year-old brother. “What are you doing 
in my costume? It’s supposed to be my costume.” 

“I was just trying it on,” Noah said, his blue eyes staring down at her 
through the white-and-yellow duck mask. “Did I scare you?” 

“Not a bit,” Carly Beth lied. “Now get up! You’re heavy!” 

He refused to budge. 

“Why do you always want everything that’s mine?” Carly Beth demanded 
angrily. 

“I don’t,” he replied. 

“And why do you think it’s so funny to try to scare me all the time?” she 
asked. 

“I can’t help it if you get scared every time I say boo,” he replied nastily. 

“Get up! Get up!” 

He quacked a few more times, flapping the feathery wings. Then he 
climbed to his feet. “Can I have this costume? It’s really neat.” 

Carly Beth frowned and shook her head. “You got feathers all over me. 
You’re molting!” 



“Molting? What’s that mean?” Noah demanded. He pulled off the mask. 
His blond hair was damp from sweat and matted against his head. 

“It means you’re going to be a bald duck!” Carly Beth told him. 

“I don’t care. Can I have this costume?” Noah asked, examining the mask. 
“It fits me. Really!” 

“I don’t know,” Carly Beth told him. “Maybe.” 

The phone rang in her room. “Get lost, okay? Go fly south for the winter or 
something,” she said, and hurried to answer the phone. 

As she ran to her desk, she saw white feathers all over her bed. That 
costume will never survive till Halloween! she thought. 

She picked up the receiver. “Hello? Oh, hi, Sabrina. Yeah. I’m okay.” 

Sabrina had called to remind Carly Beth that the school Science Fair was 
tomorrow. They had to finish their project, a model of the solar system 
constructed with Ping-Pong balls. 

“Come over after dinner,” Carly Beth told her. “It’s almost finished. We just 
have to paint it. My mom said she’d help us take it to school tomorrow.” 

They chatted for a while. Then Carly Beth confided, “I was so mad, 
Sabrina. At lunch today. Why do Chuck and Steve think it’s so funny to do 
things like that to me?” 

Sabrina was silent for a moment. “I guess it’s because you’re so scare-able, 
Carly Beth.” 

“Scare-able?” 

“You scream so easily,” Sabrina said. “Other people get scared. But they’re 
more quiet about it. You know Chuck and Steve. They don’t really mean to be 
mean. They just think it’s funny.” 

“Well, I don’t think it’s funny at all,” Carly Beth replied unhappily. “And 
I’m not going to be scare-able anymore. I mean it. I’m not ever going to scream 
or get frightened again.” 

The science projects were all set up for judging on the stage in the 
auditorium. Mrs. Armbruster, the principal, and Mr. Smythe, the science teacher, 
walked from display to display, making notes on their clipboards. 

The solar system, as designed by Carly Beth and Sabrina, had survived the 
trip to school in pretty good shape. Pluto had a slight dent in it, which the girls 
had struggled unsuccessfully to straighten out. And Earth kept coming loose 
from its string and bouncing across the floor. But both girls agreed the display 



looked pretty good. 

Maybe it wasn’t as impressive as Martin Goodman’s project. Martin had 
built a computer from scratch. But Martin was a genius. And Carly Beth figured 
the judges didn’t expect everyone else to be geniuses, too. 

Looking around the crowded, noisy stage, Carly Beth saw other interesting 
projects. Mary Sue Chong had built some kind of electronic robot arm that could 
pick up a cup or wave to people. And Brian Baldwin had several glass bottles 
filled with brown gunky stuff that he claimed was toxic waste. 

Someone had done a chemical analysis of the town’s drinking water. And 
someone had built a volcano that would erupt when the two judges came by. 

“Our project is kind of boring,” Sabrina whispered nervously to Carly Beth, 
her eyes on the two judges who were oohing and aahing over Martin Goodman’s 
homemade computer. “I mean, it’s just painted Ping-Pong balls on strings.” 

“I like our project,” Carly Beth insisted. “We worked hard on it, Sabrina.” 

“I know,” Sabrina replied fretfully. “But it’s still kind of boring.” 

The volcano erupted, sending up a gusher of red liquid. The judges 
appeared impressed. Several kids cheered. 

“Uh-oh. Here they come,” Carly Beth whispered, jamming her hands into 
her jeans pockets. Mrs. Armbruster and Mr. Smythe, smiles plastered across 
their faces, were coming closer. 

They stopped to examine a display of light and crystals. 

Suddenly, Carly Beth heard an excited shout from somewhere behind her 
on the stage. “My tarantula! Hey—my tarantula got out!” 

She recognized Steve’s voice. 

“Where’s my tarantula?” he called. 

Several kids uttered startled cries. Some kids laughed. 

I’m not going to get scared, Carly Beth told herself, swallowing hard. 

She knew she was terrified of tarantulas. But this time she was determined 
not to show it. 

“My tarantula—it got away!” Steve shouted over the roar of excited voices. 

I’m not going to get scared. I’m not going to get scared, Carly Beth 
repeated to herself. 

But then she felt something pinch the back of her leg and dig its spiny 
pincer into her skin—and Carly Beth uttered a shrill scream of terror that rang 
out through the auditorium. 



5 


Carly Beth screamed and knocked over the solar system. 

She kicked her leg wildly, trying to toss off the tarantula. Ping-Pong ball 
planets bounced over the floor. 

She screamed again. “Get it off me! Get it off!” 

“Carly Beth—stop!” Sabrina pleaded. “You’re okay! You’re okay!” 

It took Carly Beth a long while to realize that everyone was laughing. Her 
heart pounding, she spun around to find Steve down on his hands and knees 
behind her. 

He made a pinching motion with his thumb and finger. “Gotcha again,” he 
said, grinning up at her. 

“Noooo!” Carly Beth cried. 

There was no tarantula, she realized. Steve had pinched her leg. 

She raised her head and saw that kids all over the stage were laughing. Mrs. 
Armbruster and Mr. Smythe were laughing, too. 

With a cry of anger, Carly Beth tried to kick Steve in the side. But he spun 
away. She missed. 

“Help me pick up the planets,” she heard Sabrina say. 

But Sabrina seemed far, far away. 

All Carly Beth could hear was the pounding of her heart and the laughter of 
the kids all around her. Steve had climbed to his feet. He and Chuck were side by 
side, grinning at her, slapping each other high-fives. 

“Carly Beth—help me,” Sabrina pleaded. 

But Carly Beth spun away, jumped off the stage, and ran, escaping up the 
dark auditorium aisle. 

I’m going to pay Steve and Chuck back, she vowed angrily, her sneakers 
thudding loudly up the concrete aisle. I’m going to scare them, REALLY scare 
them! 

But how?

“Okay. What time should I meet you?” Carly Beth asked, cradling the phone 
between her chin and shoulder. 

On the other end of the line, Sabrina considered for a moment. “How about 
seven-thirty?” 

It was Halloween. The plan was to meet at Sabrina’s house, then go trick- 
or-treating through the entire neighborhood. 

“The earlier the better. We’ll get more candy,” Sabrina said. “Did Steve call 
you?” 

“Yeah. He called,” Carly Beth replied bitterly. 

“Did he apologize?” 

“Yeah, he apologized,” Carly Beth muttered, rolling her eyes. “Big deal. I 
mean, he already made me look like a jerk in front of the entire school. What 
good is an apology?” 

“I think he felt bad,” Sabrina replied. 

“I hope he felt bad!” Carly Beth exclaimed. “It was so mean!” 

“It was a dirty trick,” Sabrina agreed. And then she added, “But you’ll have 
to admit it was kind of funny.” 

“I don’t have to admit anything!” Carly Beth snapped. 

“Has it stopped raining?” Sabrina asked, changing the subject. 

Carly Beth pulled back the curtain to glance out her bedroom window. The 
evening sky was charcoal-gray. Dark clouds hovered low. But the rain had 
stopped. The street glistened wetly under the light of a streetlamp. 

“No rain. I’ve got to go. See you at seven-thirty,” Carly Beth said, speaking 
rapidly. 

“Hey, wait. What’s your costume?” Sabrina demanded. 

“It’s a surprise,” Carly Beth told her, and hung up. 

It’ll be a surprise to me, too, she told herself, glancing unhappily at the 
feathery duck costume, rolled up on the chair in the corner. 

Carly Beth’s plan had been to go to the new party store after school and 
pick out the ugliest, most disgusting, scariest mask they had. But her mother had 
picked her up after school and insisted that she stay home and watch Noah for a 
couple of hours. 



Mrs. Caldwell hadn’t returned home until five-fifteen. Now it was nearly a 
quarter till six. There was no way the party store would still be open, Carly Beth 
thought, frowning at the duck costume. 

“Quack quack,” she said miserably. 

She walked to the mirror and ran a hairbrush through her hair. Maybe it’s 
worth a try, she thought. Maybe that store stays open late on Halloween. 

She pulled open her top dresser drawer and took out her wallet. Did she 
have enough money for a good, scary mask? 

Thirty dollars. Her life savings. 

She wadded up the bills and stuffed them back into the wallet. Then, 
jamming the wallet into her jeans pocket, she grabbed her coat and hurried 
downstairs and out the front door. 

The evening air was cold and damp. Carly Beth struggled to zip her coat as 
she jogged toward the party store. The house next door had a glowing jack-o’- 
lantern in the front window. The house on the corner had paper skeletons strung 
up across the front porch. 

The wind howled through the bare trees. The branches above her head 
shook and rattled like bony arms. 

What a creepy night, Carly Beth thought. 

She started running a little faster. A car rolled silently by, sending harsh 
white light floating across the sidewalk like a bright ghost. 

Glancing across the street, Carly Beth saw the old Carpenter mansion 
looming over its dark, weed-choked lawn. Everyone said the ramshackle old 
house was haunted by people who had been murdered inside it a hundred years 
ago. 

Once, Carly Beth had heard frightening howls coming from the old 
mansion. When she was Noah’s age, Steve and Chuck and some other kids had 
dared each other to go up to the house and knock on the door. Carly Beth had run 
home instead. She never did find out if the other kids were brave enough to do it. 

Now Carly Beth felt a chill of fear as she hurried past the old house. She 
knew this neighborhood really well. She had lived in it her entire life. But 
tonight it looked different to her. 

Was it just the wet glow left by the rain? 

No. It was a heavy feeling in the air. A heavier darkness. The eerie orange 
glow of grinning pumpkins in windows. The silent cries of ghouls and monsters 



waiting to float free on their night to celebrate. Halloween. 

Trying to force all the scary thoughts from her mind, Carly Beth turned the 
corner. The little party store came into view. The window was lighted, revealing 
two rows of Halloween masks, staring out at the street. 

But was the store still open? 

Crossing her fingers, Carly Beth waited for a truck to rumble past, then 
eagerly jogged across the street. She stopped for a second to examine the masks 
in the window. There were gorilla masks, monster masks, some sort of blue¬ 
haired alien mask. 

Pretty good, she thought. These are pretty ugly. But they probably have 
even scarier ones inside. 

The lights were on in the store. She peered through the glass door. Then she 
tried turning the knob. 

It didn’t move. 

She tried again. She tried pulling the door open. Then she tried pushing. 

No. No way. 

She was too late. The store was closed.

Carly Beth sighed and peered in through the glass. The walls of the tiny store 
were covered with masks. The masks seemed to stare back at her. 

They’re laughing at me, she thought unhappily. Laughing at me because 
I’m too late. Because the store is closed, and I’m going to have to be a stupid 
duck for Halloween. 

Suddenly, a dark shadow moved over the glass, blocking Carly Beth’s view. 
She gasped and took a step back. 

It took her a moment to realize that the shadow was a man. A man in a 
black suit, staring out at her, a look of surprise on his face. 

“Are you—are you closed?” Carly Beth shouted through the glass. 

The man gestured that he couldn’t hear her. He turned the lock and pulled 
the door open an inch. “Can I help you?” he asked curtly. He had shiny black 
hair, parted in the middle and slicked down on his head, and a pencil-thin black 
mustache. 

“Are you open?” Carly Beth asked timidly. “I need a Halloween mask.” 

“It’s very late,” the man replied, not answering her question. He pulled the 
door open another few inches. “We normally close at five.” 

“I really would like to buy a mask,” Carly Beth told him in her most 
determined voice. 

The man’s tiny, black eyes peered into hers. His expression remained blank. 
“Come in,” he said quietly. 

As Carly Beth stepped past him into the store, she saw that he wore a black 
cape. It must be a Halloween costume, she told herself. I’m sure he doesn’t wear 
that all the time. 

She turned her attention to the masks on the two walls. 

“What kind of mask are you looking for?” the man asked, closing the door 
behind him. 

Carly Beth felt a stab of fear. His black eyes glowed like two burning coals. 
He seemed so strange. And here she was, locked in this closed store with him. 

“A s-scary one,” she stammered. 

He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. He pointed to the wall. “The gorilla mask 
has been very popular. It has real hair. I believe I may have one left in stock.” 



Carly Beth stared up at the gorilla mask. She didn’t really want to be a 
gorilla. It was too ordinary. It wasn’t scary enough. “Hmmm... do you have 
anything scarier?” she asked. 

He flipped his cape back over the shoulder of his black suit. “How about 
that yellowish one with the pointy ears?” he suggested, pointing. “I believe it’s 
some sort of Star Trek character. I still have a few of them, I believe.” 

“No.” Carly Beth shook her head. “I need something really scary.” 

A strange smile formed under the man’s thin mustache. His eyes burned 
into hers, as if trying to read her thoughts. “Look around,” he said, with a sweep 
of his hand. “Everything I have left in stock is up on the walls.” 

Carly Beth turned her gaze to the masks. A pig mask with long, ugly tusks 
and blood trickling from the snout caught her eye. Pretty good, she thought. But 
not quite right. 

A hairy werewolf mask with white, pointy fangs was hung beside it. Again, 
too ordinary, Carly Beth decided. 

Her eyes glanced over a green Frankenstein mask, a Freddy Krueger mask 
that came with Freddy’s hand—complete with long, silvery blades for fingers— 
and an E.T. mask. 

Just not scary enough, Carly Beth thought, starting to feel a little desperate. 
I need something that will really make Steve and Chuck die of fright! 

“Young lady, I am afraid I must ask you to make your choice,” the man in 
the cape said softly. He had moved behind the narrow counter at the front and 
was turning a key in the cash register. “We really are closed, after all.” 

“I’m sorry,” Carly Beth started. “It’s just that—” 

The phone rang before she could finish explaining. 

The man picked it up quickly and began talking in a low voice, turning his 
back to Carly Beth. 

She wandered toward the back of the store, studying the masks as she 
walked. She passed a black cat mask with long, ugly yellow fangs. A vampire 
mask with bright red blood trickling down its lips was hung next to a grinning, 
bald mask of Uncle Fester from The Addams Family. 

Not right, not right, not right, Carly Beth thought, frowning. 

She hesitated when she spotted a narrow door slightly opened at the back of 
the store. Was there another room? Were there more masks back there? 

She glanced to the front. The man, hidden behind his cape, still had his 
back to her as he talked on the phone. 



Carly Beth gave the door a hesitant push to peek inside. The door creaked 
open. Pale orange light washed over the small, shadowy back room. 

Carly Beth stepped inside—and gasped in amazement. 



8 


Two dozen empty eye sockets stared blindly at Carly Beth. 

She gaped in horror at the distorted, deformed faces. 

They were masks, she realized. Two shelves of masks. But the masks were 
so ugly, so grotesque—so real —they made her breath catch in her throat. 

Carly Beth gripped the doorframe, reluctant to enter the tiny back room. 
Staring into the dim orange light, she studied the hideous masks. 

One mask had long, stringy yellow hair falling over its bulging, green 
forehead. A hairy black rat’s head poked up from a knot in the hair, the rat’s eyes 
gleaming like two dark jewels. 

The mask beside it had a large nail stuck through an eyehole. Thick, wet¬ 
looking blood poured from the eye, down the cheek. 

Chunks of rotting skin appeared to be falling off another mask, revealing 
gray bone underneath. An enormous black insect, some kind of grotesque beetle, 
poked out from between the green-and-yellow decayed teeth. 

Carly Beth’s horror mixed with excitement. She took a step into the room. 
The wooden floorboards creaked noisily beneath her. 

She took another step closer to the grotesque, grinning masks. They seemed 
so real, so horribly real. The faces had such detail. The skin appeared to be made 
of flesh, not rubber or plastic. 

These are perfect! she thought, her heart pounding. These are just what I 
was looking for. They look terrifying just propped up on these shelves! 

She imagined Steve and Chuck seeing one of these masks coming at them 
in the dark of night. She pictured herself uttering a bloodcurdling scream and 
leaping out from behind a tree in one of them. 

She imagined the horrified expressions on the boys’ faces. She pictured 
Steve and Chuck shrieking in terror and running for their lives. 

Perfect. Perfect! 

What a laugh that would be. What a victory! 

Carly Beth took a deep breath and stepped up to the shelves. Her eyes 
settled on an ugly mask on the lower shelf. 

It had a bulging, bald head. Its skin was a putrid yellow-green. Its 
enormous, sunken eyes were an eerie orange and seemed to glow. It had a broad, 



flat nose, smashed in like a skeleton’s nose. The dark-lipped mouth gaped wide, 
revealing jagged animal fangs. 

Staring hard at the hideous mask, Carly Beth reached out a hand toward it. 
Reluctantly, she touched the broad forehead. 

And as she touched it, the mask cried out. 



9 


“Ohh!” 

Carly Beth shrieked and jerked back her hand. 

The mask grinned at her. Its orange eyes glowed brightly. The lips appeared 
to curl back over the fangs. 

She suddenly felt dizzy. What is going on here? 

As she staggered back, away from the shelves, she realized that the angry 
cry hadn’t come from the mask. 

It had come from behind her. 

Carly Beth spun around to see the black-caped store owner glaring at her 
from the doorway. His dark eyes flashed. His mouth was turned down into a 
menacing frown. 

“Oh. I thought—” Carly Beth started, glancing back at the mask. She still 
felt confused. Her heart pounded loudly in her chest. 

“I am sorry you saw these,” the man said in a low, threatening voice. He 
took a step toward her, his cape brushing the doorway. 

What is he going to do? Carly Beth wondered, uttering a horrified gasp. 
Why is he coming at me like that? 

What is he going to do to me? 

“I am so sorry,” he repeated, his small, dark eyes burning into hers. He took 
another step closer. 

Carly Beth backed away from him. Then she uttered a startled cry as she 
backed into the display shelves. 

The hideous masks jiggled and quaked, as if alive. 

“What—what do you mean?” she managed to choke out. “I—I was just—” 

“I am sorry you saw these because they are not for sale,” the man said 
softly. 

He stepped past her and straightened one of the masks on its stand. 

Carly Beth breathed a loud sigh of relief. He didn’t mean to scare me, she 
told herself. I am scaring myself. 

She crossed her arms in front of her coat and tried to force her heartbeat to 
return to normal. She stepped to the side as the store owner continued to arrange 
the masks, handling them carefully, brushing their hair with one hand, tenderly 



dusting off their bulging, blood-covered foreheads. 

“Not for sale? Why not?” Carly Beth demanded. Her voice came out tiny 
and shrill. 

“Too scary,” the man replied. He turned to smile at her. 

“But I want a really scary one,” Carly Beth told him. “I want that one.” She 
pointed to the mask she had touched, the mask with the open mouth and its 
terrifying, jagged fangs. 

“Too scary,” the man repeated, pushing his cape behind his shoulder. 

“But it’s Halloween!” Carly Beth protested. 

“I have a really scary gorilla mask,” the man said, motioning for Carly Beth 
to go back to the front room. “Very scary. Looks like it’s growling. I will give 
you a good price on it since it’s so late.” 

Carly Beth shook her head, her arms crossed defiantly in front of her. “A 
gorilla mask won’t scare Steve and Chuck,” she said. 

The man’s expression changed. “Who?” 

“My friends,” she told him. “I have to have that one,” she insisted. “It’s so 
scary, I’m almost afraid to touch it. It’s perfect.” 

“It’s too scary,” the man repeated, lowering his eyes to it. He ran his hand 
over the green forehead. “I can’t take the responsibility.” 

“It’s so real looking!” Carly Beth gushed. “They’ll both faint. I know they 
will. Then they’ll never try to scare me again.” 

“Young lady—” the store owner started, glancing impatiently at his watch. 
“I really must insist that you make up your mind. I am a patient man, but—” 

“Please!” Carly Beth begged. “Please sell it to me! Here. Look.” She dug 
into her jeans pocket and pulled out the money she had brought. 

“Young lady, I—” 

“Thirty dollars,” Carly Beth said, shoving the wadded-up bills into the 
man’s hand. “I’ll give you thirty dollars for it. That’s enough, isn’t it?” 

“It’s not a matter of money,” he told her. “These masks are not for sale.” 
With an exasperated sigh, he started toward the doorway that led to the front of 
the store. 

“Please! I need it. I really need it!” Carly Beth begged, chasing after him. 

“These masks are too real,” he insisted, gesturing to the shelves. “I’m 
warning you—” 

“Please? Please?” 

He shut his eyes. “You will be sorry.” 



“No, I won’t. I won’t. I know I won’t!” Carly Beth exclaimed gleefully, 
seeing that he was about to give in. 

He opened his eyes. He shook his head. She could see that he was debating 
with himself. 

With a sigh, he tucked the money into his coat pocket. Then he carefully 
lifted the mask from the shelf, straightening the pointed ears, and started to hand 
it to her. 

“Thanks!” she cried, eagerly snatching the mask from his hands. “It’s 
perfect! Perfect!” 

She held the mask by the flat nose. It felt soft and surprisingly warm. 
“Thanks again!” she cried, hurrying to the front, the mask gripped tightly in her 
hand. 

“Can I give you a bag for it?” the man called after her. 

But Carly Beth was already out of the store. 

She crossed the street and started to run toward home. The sky was black. 
No stars poked through. The street still glistened wetly from the afternoon’s rain. 

This is going to be the best trick-or-treat night ever, Carly Beth thought 
happily. Because this is the night I get my revenge. 

She couldn’t wait to spring out at Steve and Chuck. She wondered what 
their costumes would be. They had both talked about painting their faces blue 
and dyeing their hair blue and being Smurfs. 

Lame. Really lame. 

Carly Beth stopped under a streetlight and held up the mask, gripping it 
with both hands by its pointed ears. It grinned up at her, the two crooked rows of 
fangs hanging over its thick, rubbery lips. 

Then, tucking it carefully under one arm, she ran the rest of the way home. 

Stopping at the bottom of the driveway, she gazed up at her house, the front 
windows all glowing brightly, the porchlight sending white light over the lawn. 

I’ve got to try this mask out on someone, she thought eagerly. I’ve got to 
see just how good it is. 

Her brother’s grinning face popped into her mind. 

“Noah. Of course,” she said aloud. “Noah has really been asking for it.” 

Grinning gleefully, Carly Beth hurried up the drive, eager to make Noah her 
first victim. 



10 


Carly Beth crept silently through the front door and tossed her coat onto the 
entryway floor. The house felt stuffy and hot. A sweet smell, the aroma of hot 
cider on the stove, greeted her. 

Mom really gets into holidays, she thought with a smile. 

Tiptoeing through the front hallway, holding the mask in front of her, Carly 
Beth listened hard. 

Noah, where are you? 

Where are you, my little guinea pig? 

Noah was always bragging about how he was so much braver than Carly 
Beth. He was always putting bugs down her back and planting rubber snakes in 
her bed—anything he could think of to make her scream. 

She heard footsteps above her head. Noah must be up in his room, she 
realized. He’s probably putting on his Halloween costume. 

At the last minute, Noah had decided he wanted to be a cockroach. Mrs. 
Caldwell had dashed frantically all over the house, finding the materials to build 
pointy feelers and a hard shell for his back. 

Well, the little bug is in for a surprise, Carly Beth thought evilly. She 
examined her mask. This should send that cockroach scampering under the sink! 

She stopped at the bottom of the stairs. She could hear loud music coming 
from Noah’s room. An old heavy-metal song. 

Gripping the mask by the rubbery neck, she raised it carefully over her 
head, then pulled it slowly down. 

It was surprisingly warm inside. The mask fit tighter than Carly Beth had 
imagined. It had a funny smell, kind of sour, kind of old, like damp newspapers 
that have been left for years in an attic or garage. 

She slid it all the way down until she could see through the eyeholes. Then 
she smoothed the bulging, bald head over her head and tugged the neck down. 

I should have stopped in front of a mirror, she fretted. I can’t see if it looks 
right. 

The mask felt very tight. Her breathing echoed noisily in the flat nose. She 
forced herself to ignore the sour smell that invaded her nose. 

She held on tightly to the banister as she crept up the stairs. It was hard to 



see the steps through the eyeholes. She had to take the climb slowly, one step at 
a time. 

The heavy-metal music ended as she stepped onto the landing. She crept 
silently down the hall and stopped outside Noah’s door. 

Carly Beth edged her head into the doorway and peeked into the brightly lit 
room. Noah was standing in front of the mirror, adjusting the two long 
cockroach feelers above his head. 

“Noah—I’m coming for you!” Carly Beth called. 

To her surprise, her voice came out gruff and low. It wasn’t her voice at all! 

“Huh?” Startled, Noah spun around. 

“Noah—I’ve got you!” Carly Beth shrieked, her voice deep, raspy, evil. 

“No!” her brother uttered a hushed cry of protest. Even under his bug 
makeup, Carly Beth could see him go pale. 

She darted into the room, her arms outstretched as if ready to grab him. 

“No— please !” he cried, his expression terrified. “Who are you? How— 
how did you get in?” 

He doesn’t even recognize me! Carly Beth thought gleefully. 

And he’s scared to death! 

Was it the hideous face? The deep rumble of a voice? Or both? 

Carly Beth didn’t care. The mask was definitely a success! 

“I’ve GOT you!” she screamed, surprising herself at how scary her voice 
sounded from inside the mask. 

“No! Please!” Noah begged. “Mom! Mom!” He backed toward the bed, 
trembling all over, his feelers quivering in fright. “Mom! Hellllpl” 

Carly Beth burst out laughing. The laughter came out in a deep rumble. 
“It’s me, stupid!” she cried. “What a yellow-bellied scaredy-cat!” 

“Huh?” Still huddled by the bed, Noah stared hard at her. 

“Don’t you recognize my jeans? My sweater? It’s me, you idiot!” Carly 
Beth declared in the gruff voice. 

“But your face—that mask!” Noah stammered. “It—it really scared me. I 
mean—” He gaped at her, studying the mask. “It didn’t sound like you, Carly 
Beth,” he muttered. “I thought—” 

Carly Beth tugged at the bottom of the mask, trying to lift it off. It felt hot 
and sticky. She was panting noisily. 

She tried pulling the bottom with both hands. The mask didn’t budge. 

She raised her hands to the pointed ears and tried lifting it off. She tugged. 



Tugged harder. 

She tried pulling the mask off by the top of the head. It didn’t move. 
“Hey—it won’t come off!” she cried. “The mask—it won’t come off!” 



11 


“What’s going on here?” Carly Beth cried, tugging at the mask with both hands. 

“Stop it!” Noah cried. His voice sounded angry, but his eyes revealed fear. 
“Stop kidding around, Carly Beth. You’re scaring me!” 

“I’m not kidding around,” Carly Beth insisted in her harsh, raspy voice. “I 
really can’t—get—this—off!” 

“Take it off! You’re not funny!” her brother shouted. 

With great effort, Carly Beth managed to slip her fingers under the neck of 
the mask. Then, she pulled it away from her skin and lifted it off her head. 

“Whew!” 

The air felt so cool and sweet. She shook her hair free. Then she playfully 
tossed the mask at Noah. “Good mask, huh?” She grinned at him. 

He let the mask bounce onto the bed. Then he picked it up hesitantly and 
examined it. “Where’d you get it?” he asked, poking a finger against the ugly 
fangs. 

“At that new party store,” she told him, wiping perspiration from her 
forehead. “It’s so hot inside it.” 

“Can I try it on?” Noah asked, pushing his fingers through the eyeholes. 

“Not now. I’m late,” she replied sharply. She laughed. “You sure looked 
scared.” 

He tossed the mask back at her, frowning. “I was just pretending,” he said. 
“I knew it was you.” 

“For sure!” she replied, rolling her eyes. “That’s why you screamed like a 
maniac.” 

“I did not scream,” Noah protested. “I was just putting on an act. For you.” 

“Yeah. Right,” Carly Beth muttered. She turned and headed toward the 
door, rolling the mask over her hand. 

“How’d you change your voice like that?” Noah called after her. 

Carly Beth stopped at the doorway and turned back to him. Her smile gave 
way to a puzzled expression. 

“That deep voice was the scariest part,” Noah said, staring at the mask in 
her hand. “How did you do that?” 

“I don’t know,” Carly Beth replied thoughtfully. “I really don’t know.” 



* * * 


By the time she got to her room, she was grinning again. The mask had 
worked. It had been a wonderful success. 

Noah might not want to admit it, but when Carly Beth burst in on him, 
growling through the hideous mask, he nearly jumped out of his cockroach shell. 

Look out, Chuck and Steve! she thought gleefully. You’re next! 

She sat down on her bed and glanced at the clock radio on her bed table. 
She had a few minutes until it was time to meet everyone in front of Sabrina’s 
house. 

Time enough to think of the best possible way to give them the scare of 
their lives. 

I don’t want to just jump out at them, Carly Beth thought, playing her 
fingers over the sharp fangs. That’s too boring. 

I want to do something they’ll remember. 

Something they’ll never forget. 

She ran her hands over the mask’s pointy ears. Suddenly she had an idea. 



12 


Carly Beth pulled the old broom handle from the closet. She brushed off a thick 
ball of dust and examined the long, wooden pole. 

Perfect, she thought. 

She checked to make sure her mother was still in the kitchen. She was sure 
that her mother wouldn’t approve of what Carly Beth was about to do. Mrs. 
Caldwell still thought that Carly Beth was going to wear the duck costume. 

Tiptoeing silently into the living room, Carly Beth stepped up to the mantel 
and pulled down the plaster of Paris head her mother had sculpted. 

It really does look just like me, Carly Beth thought, holding the sculpture 
waist high and studying it carefully. It’s so lifelike. Mom is really talented. 

Carefully, she placed the head on the broomstick. It balanced easily. 

She carried it over to the hallway mirror. It looks like I’m carrying my real 
head on a stick, Carly Beth thought, admiring it. A wide grin broke out across 
her face. Her eyes sparkled gleefully. 

Excellent! 

She leaned the head and stick against the wall and pulled on the mask. Once 
again, the sour aroma rushed into her nostrils. The heat of the mask seemed to 
wrap around her. 

The mask tightened against her skin as she pulled it down. 

Raising her eyes to the mirror, she nearly frightened herself ! It’s like a real 
face, she thought, unable to take her eyes away. My eyes seem a part of it. It 
doesn’t look as if I’m peering out of eyeholes. 

She moved the gmesome mouth up and down a few times. It moves like a 
real mouth, she realized. 

It doesn’t look like a mask at all. 

It looks like a gross, deformed face. 

Working with both hands, she flattened the bulging forehead, smoothing it 
over her hair. 

Excellent! she repeated to herself, feeling her excitement grow. Excellent! 

The mask is perfect! she decided. She couldn’t believe the man in the party 
store didn’t want to sell it to her. It was the scariest, realest, ugliest mask she had 


ever seen. 



I will be the terror of Maple Avenue tonight! Carly Beth decided, admiring 
herself in the mirror. Kids will be having nightmares about me for weeks! 

Especially Chuck and Steve, she told herself. 

“Boo!” she muttered to herself, pleased to hear that the gruff voice had 
returned. “I’m ready.” 

She picked up the broomstick, carefully balanced her sculpted head on top 
of it, and started to the door. 

Her mother’s voice stopped her. “Carly Beth—wait up,” Mrs. Caldwell 
called from the kitchen. “I want to see how you look in that duck costume!” 

“Uh-oh,” Carly Beth groaned out loud. “Mom isn’t going to like this.” 



13 


Carly Beth froze in the doorway. She could hear her mother’s footsteps 
approaching in the hallway. 

“Let me see you, dear,” Mrs. Caldwell called. “Did the costume fit?” 

Maybe I should’ve told her about my change of plans, Carly Beth thought 
guiltily. I would’ve said something, but I didn’t want to hurt Mom’s feelings. 

Now she’s in for a shock. And she’s going to be really angry when she sees 
I’ve borrowed her sculpture. 

She’s going to make me put it back on the mantel. 

She’s going to ruin everything. 

“I’m kind of in a hurry, Mom,” Carly Beth called, her voice deep and raspy 
inside the mask. “I’ll see you later, okay?” She pulled open the front door. 

“You can wait one second while I see my costume on you,” her mother 
called. She rounded the corner and came into view. 

I’m sunk, Carly Beth thought with a groan. 

I’m caught. 

The phone rang. The sound echoed loudly inside Carly Beth’s mask. 

Her mother stopped and turned back to the kitchen. “Oh, darn. I’d better 
answer that. It’s probably your father calling from Chicago.” She disappeared 
back to the kitchen. “I’ll have to see you later, Carly Beth. Be careful, okay?” 

Carly Beth breathed a sigh of relief. Saved by the bell, she thought. 

Balancing the head on the broomstick, she hurried out the door. She closed 
the door behind her and jogged down the front yard. 

It had become a clear, cool night. A pale half-moon rose low over the bare 
trees. Fat brown leaves swirled around her ankles as she headed to the sidewalk. 

The plan was to meet Chuck and Steve in front of Sabrina’s house. Carly 
Beth couldn’t wait. 

Her head bobbed and bounced on the broomstick as she ran. The house on 
the corner had been decorated for Halloween. Orange lights ran along the top of 
the stoop. Two large, smiling pumpkin cutouts stood beside the doorway. A 
cardboard skeleton had been propped up at the end of the front walk. 

I love Halloween! Carly Beth thought happily. She crossed the street onto 
Sabrina’s block. 



On other Halloween nights, she had been frightened. Her friends were 
always playing mean tricks on her. Last year, Steve had slipped a very real- 
looking rubber rat into her trick-or-treat bag. 

When Carly Beth had reached into the bag, she felt something soft and 
hairy. She pulled out the rat and shrieked at the top of her lungs. She was so 
scared, she spilled her candy all over the driveway. 

Chuck and Steve thought it was a riot. So did Sabrina. They always spoiled 
Halloween for her. They thought it was so hilarious to scare Carly Beth and 
make her scream. 

Well, this year I won’t be the one screaming, she thought. This year, I’ll be 
the one making everyone else scream. 

Sabrina’s house was at the end of the block. As Carly Beth hurried toward 
it, bare tree limbs shivered above her. The half-moon disappeared behind a 
heavy cloud, and the ground darkened. 

The head on the broom handle bounced and nearly fell off. Carly Beth 
slowed her pace. She glanced up at the head, shifting her grip on the broomstick. 

The eyes on the sculpted head stared straight ahead, as if watching out for 
trouble. In the darkness, the head looked real. The shadows moving over it as 
Carly Beth walked under the bare tree limbs made the eyes and mouth appear to 
move. 

Hearing laughter, Carly Beth turned. Across the street, a group of trick-or- 
treaters was invading a brightly lit front porch. In the yellow porchlight, Carly 
Beth saw a ghost, a Mutant Ninja Turtle, a Freddy Krueger, and a princess in a 
pink ballgown and a tinfoil crown. The kids were little. Two mothers watched 
them from the foot of the driveway. 

Carly Beth watched them get their candy. Then she walked the rest of the 
way to Sabrina’s house. She climbed the front stoop, stepping into a white 
triangle of light from the porchlight. She could hear voices inside the house, 
Sabrina shouting something to her mother, a TV on in the living room. 

Carly Beth adjusted her mask with her free hand. She straightened the 
gaping, fanged mouth. Then she checked to make sure the head was balanced on 
the broomstick. 

She reached to ring Sabrina’s doorbell—then stopped. 

Voices behind her. 

She turned and squinted into the darkness. Two costumed boys were 
approaching, shoving each other playfully on the sidewalk. 



Chuck and Steve! 

I’m just in time, Carly Beth thought happily. She leapt off the stoop and 
crouched behind a low evergreen shrub. 

Okay, guys, she thought eagerly, her heart pounding. Get ready for a scare. 



14 


Carly Beth peered over the top of the shrub. The two boys were halfway up the 
drive. 

It was too dark to get a good look at their costumes. One of them wore a 
long overcoat and a wide-brimmed, Indiana Jones fedora. She couldn’t really see 
the other one. 

Carly Beth took a deep breath and prepared to leap out at them. She gripped 
the broomstick tightly. 

My whole body is trembling, she realized. The mask suddenly felt hot, as if 
her excitement had heated it up. Her breath rattled noisily in the flat nose. 

Walking slowly, playfully blocking each other with their shoulders like 
football linemen, the boys made their way up the driveway. One of them said 
something Carly Beth couldn’t hear. The other one laughed loudly, a high- 
pitched giggle. 

Peering into the darkness, Carly Beth watched them until they were nearly 
right in front of the shrub. 

Okay—now! she declared silently. 

Raising the broomstick with its staring head on the top, she leapt out. 

The boys shrieked, startled. 

She could see their dark eyes go wide as they gaped at her mask. 

A ferocious roar escaped her throat. A deep, rumbling howl that frightened 
even her. 

At the terrifying sound, both boys cried out again. One of them actually 
dropped to his knees on the driveway. 

They both stared up at the head, bobbing on the broomstick. It seemed to 
glare down at them. 

Another howl escaped Carly Beth’s throat. It started low, as if coming from 
far away, and then pierced the air, raspy and deep, like the roar of an angry 
creature. 

“Noooo!” one of the boys cried. 

“Who are you?” the other cried. “Leave us alone!” 

Carly Beth heard rapid footsteps crunching over the dead leaves on the 
driveway. Looking up, she saw a woman in a bulky down coat running up the 



drive. 

“Hey—what are you doing?” the woman demanded, her voice shrill and 
angry. “Are you scaring my kids?” 

“Huh?” Carly Beth swallowed hard. She turned her eyes back to the two 
frightened boys. 

“Wait!” she cried, realizing they weren’t Chuck and Steve. 

“What are you doing?” the woman repeated breathlessly. She stepped up to 
the two boys and put a hand on each of their shoulders. “Are you two okay?” 

“Yeah. We’re okay, Mom,” the one in the overcoat and fedora replied. 

The other boy wore white makeup and a red clown nose. “She—she jumped 
out at us,” he told his mother, avoiding Carly Beth’s stare. “She kind of scared 
us.” 

The woman turned angrily to Carly Beth and shook her finger at her 
accusingly. “Don’t you have anything better to do than to scare two young boys? 
Why don’t you pick on someone your own age?” 

Normally Carly Beth would have apologized. She would have explained to 
the woman that she made a mistake, that she meant to scare two different boys. 

But hidden behind the ugly mask, still hearing the strange howl that had 
burst so unexpectedly from her throat, she didn’t feel like apologizing. 

She felt... anger. And she wasn’t sure why. 

“Go away!” she rasped, waving the broomstick menacingly. The head —her 
head—stared down at the two startled boys. 

“What did you say?” their mother demanded, her voice tight with growing 
outrage. “What did you say?” 

“I said go away!” Carly Beth snarled in a voice so deep, so terrifying, that it 
frightened even her. 

The woman crossed her arms in front of the heavy, down coat. Her eyes 
narrowed on Carly Beth. “Who are you? What is your name?” she demanded. 
“Do you live around here?” 

“Mom—let’s just go,” the boy with the clown face urged, tugging at her 
coat sleeve. 

“Yeah. Come on,” his brother pleaded. 

“Go away. I’m WARNINGyou\” Carly Beth growled. 

The woman stood her ground, her arms tightly crossed, her eyes narrowed 
at Carly Beth. “Just because it’s Halloween doesn’t give you the right—” 

“Mom, we want to get some candy!” the clown pleaded, tugging his 



mother’s sleeve harder. “Come on!” 

“We’re wasting the whole night!” his brother complained. 

Carly Beth was breathing hard, her breath escaping the mask in low, noisy 
gmnts. I sound like an animal, she thought, puzzled. What is happening to me? 

She could feel her anger growing. Her breathing rattled noisily in the tight 
mask. Her face felt burning hot. 

Her anger raged through her chest. Her entire body was trembling. She felt 
about to burst. 

I’m going to tear this woman apart! Carly Beth decided. 



15 


I’ll chew her to bits! I’ll tear her skin off her bones! Furious thoughts raged 
through Carly Beth’s mind. 

She tensed her muscles, crouched low, and prepared to pounce. 

But before she could make her move, the two boys pulled their mother 
away. 

“Let’s go, Mom.” 

“Yeah. Let’s go. She’s crazy!” 

Yeah. I’m crazy. Crazy, crazy, CRAZY. The word repeated, roaring through 
Carly Beth’s mind. The mask grew hotter, tighter. 

The woman gave Carly Beth one last cold stare. Then she turned and led 
the two boys down the driveway. 

Carly Beth stared after them, panting loudly. She had a strong urge to chase 
after them—to really scare them! 

But a loud cry made her stop and spin around. 

Sabrina stood on the front stoop, leaning on the storm door, her mouth open 
in a wide O of surprise. “Who’s there?” she cried, squinting into the darkness. 

Sabrina was dressed as Cat Woman, with a silver-and-gray catsuit beneath a 
silver mask. Her black hair was pulled tightly behind her head. Her dark eyes 
stared intently at Carly Beth. 

“Don’t you recognize me?” Carly Beth rasped, stepping closer. 

She could see the fright in Sabrina’s eyes. Sabrina gripped the door handle 
tightly, standing half in and half out of her house. 

“Don’t you recognize me, Sabrina?” She waved the head on the broomstick, 
as if giving her friend a clue. 

Sabrina gasped and raised her hand to her mouth as she noticed the head on 
the pole. “Carly Beth—is that—is that you?” she stammered. Her eyes darted 
from the mask to the head, then back again. 

“Hi, Sabrina,” Carly Beth growled. “It’s me.” 

Sabrina continued to study her. “That mask!” she cried finally. “It’s 
excellent ! Really. Excellent. It’s so scary.” 

“I like your catsuit,” Carly Beth told her, stepping closer, into the light. 

Sabrina’s eyes were raised to the top of the broomstick. “That head—it’s so 



real! Where did you get it?” 

“It’s my real head!” Carly Beth joked. 

Sabrina continued to stare at it. “Carly Beth, when I first saw it, I—” 

“My mom made it,” Carly Beth told her. “In her art class.” 

“I thought it was a real head,” Sabrina said. She shivered. “The eyes. The 
way they stare at you.” 

Carly Beth shook the broomstick, making the head nod. 

Sabrina studied Carly Beth’s mask. “Wait till Chuck and Steve see your 
costume.” 

I can’t wait! Carly Beth thought darkly. “Where are they?” she demanded, 
glancing back to the street. 

“Steve called,” Sabrina replied. “He said they’d be late. He has to take his 
little sister trick-or-treating before he can meet us.” 

Carly Beth sighed, disappointed. 

“We’ll start without them,” Sabrina suggested. “They can catch up to us 
later.” 

“Yeah. Okay,” Carly Beth replied. 

“I’ll get my coat and we can go,” Sabrina said. She took one last, lingering 
look at the head on the broomstick, then the storm door slammed shut with a 
bang as she disappeared inside to get her coat. 

The wind picked up as the two girls made their way down the block. Dead 
leaves swirled at their feet. The bare trees bent and shivered. Above the dark, 
sloping roofs, the pale half-moon slipped in and out of the clouds. 

Sabrina chattered about all the problems she’d had with her costume. The 
first catsuit she’d bought had a long run in one leg and had to be returned. Then 
Sabrina couldn’t find a cat-eyed mask that looked right. 

Carly Beth remained quiet. She couldn’t hide her disappointment that 
Chuck and Steve hadn’t met them as planned. 

What if they never catch up to us? she wondered. What if we don’t see 
them at all? 

The whole point of the night, as far as Carly Beth was concerned, was 
meeting the two boys and scaring the living daylights out of them. 

Sabrina had given her a shopping bag to put her candy in. As they walked, 
Carly Beth gripped the bag in one hand, struggling to keep the head balanced on 
the pole in her other hand. 



“So where did you buy your mask? Your mother didn’t make it, did she? 
Did you go to that new party store? Can I touch it?” 

Sabrina always talked a lot. But tonight she was going for a world’s record 
of nonstop chatter. 

Carly Beth obediently stopped so that her friend could touch the mask. 
Sabrina pressed her fingers against the cheek, then instantly jerked them back. 
“Oh! It feels like skin!” 

Carly Beth laughed, a scornful laugh she had never heard before. 

“Yuck! What’s it made of?” Sabrina demanded. “It isn’t skin —is it? It’s 
some kind of rubber, right?” 

“I guess,” Carly Beth muttered. 

“Then how come it’s so warm?” Sabrina asked. “Is it uncomfortable to 
wear? You must be sweating like a pig.” 

Feeling a surge of rage, Carly Beth dropped the bag and the broomstick. 
“Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!” she snarled. 

Then with an angry howl, she grabbed Sabrina’s throat with both hands and 
began to choke her. 



16 


Sabrina uttered a shocked cry and staggered back, pulling herself from Carly 
Beth’s grip. “C-Carly Beth!” she sputtered. 

What is happening to me? Carly Beth wondered, gaping in horror at her 
friend. Why did I do that? 

“Uh... gotcha!” Carly Beth exclaimed. She laughed. “You should have seen 
the look on your face, Sabrina. Did you think I was really choking you?” 

Sabrina rubbed her neck with one silver-gloved hand. She frowned at her 
friend. “That was a joke? You scared me to death!” 

Carly Beth laughed again. “Just keeping in character,” she said lightly, 
pointing to her mask. “You know. Trying to get in the right mood. Ha-ha. I like 
scaring people. You know. Usually I’m the one who’s trembling in fright.” 

She picked up the bag and broomstick, fixing the plaster of Paris head on 
the top. Then she hurried up the nearest driveway toward a well-lighted house 
with a HAPPY HALLOWEEN banner in the front window. 

Does Sabrina believe it was just a joke? Carly Beth asked herself as she 
raised her shopping bag and rang the doorbell. What on earth was I doing? 

Why did I suddenly get so angry? Why did I attack my best friend like that? 

Sabrina stepped up beside her as the front door was pulled open. Two little 
blonde kids, a boy and a girl, appeared in the doorway. Their mother stepped up 
behind them. 

“Trick or Treat!” Carly Beth and Sabrina called out in unison. 

“Ooh, that’s a scary mask!” the woman said to her two children, grinning at 
Carly Beth. 

“What are you supposed to be? A cat?” the little boy asked Sabrina. 

Sabrina meowed at him. “I’m Cat Woman,” she told him. 

“I don’t like the other one!” the little girl exclaimed to her mother. “It’s too 
scary.” 

“It’s just a funny mask,” the mother assured her daughter. 

“Too scary. It’s scaring me!” the little girl insisted. 

Carly Beth leaned into the entryway of the house, bringing her grotesque 
face up close to the little girl. “I’ll eat you up!” she growled nastily. 

The little girl screamed and disappeared into the house. Her brother stared 



wide-eyed at Carly Beth. The mother quickly dropped candy bars into the girls’ 
bags. “You shouldn’t have scared her,” she said softly. “She has nightmares.” 

Instead of apologizing, Carly Beth turned to the little boy. “I’ll eat you up 
too!” she snarled. 

“Hey—stop!” the woman protested. 

Carly Beth laughed a deep-throated laugh, jumped off the porch, and took 
off across the front lawn. 

“Why’d you do that?” Sabrina asked as they made their way across the 
street. “Why’d you scare those kids like that?” 

“The mask made me do it,” Carly Beth replied. She meant it as a joke. But 
the thought troubled her mind. 

At the next few houses, Carly Beth hung back and let Sabrina do the 
talking. At one house, a middle-aged man in a torn blue sweater pretended to be 
scared of Carly Beth’s mask. His wife insisted that the girls come inside so that 
they could show their elderly mother the great costumes. 

Carly Beth groaned loudly, but followed Sabrina into the house. The old 
woman gazed at them blankly from her wheelchair. Carly Beth growled at her, 
but it didn’t appear to make any impression. 

On their way out the door, the man in the torn sweater handed each girl a 
green apple. Carly Beth waited till they were down on the sidewalk. Then she 
turned, pulled back her arm, and heaved the apple at the man’s house with all her 
might. 

It made a loud thunk as it smacked against the shingled front wall near the 
front door. 

“I really hate getting apples on Halloween!” Carly Beth declared. 
“Especially green ones!” 

“Carly Beth—I’m worried about you!” Sabrina cried, eyeing her friend 
with concern. “You’re not acting like you at all.” 

No. I’m not a pitiful, frightened little mouse tonight, Carly Beth thought 
bitterly. 

“Give me that,” she ordered Sabrina, and grabbed Sabrina’s apple from her 

bag. 

“Hey—stop!” Sabrina protested. 

But Carly Beth arched her arm and tossed Sabrina’s apple at the house. It 
clanged noisily as it hit the aluminum gutter. 



The man in the torn sweater poked his head out the door. “Hey—what’s the 
big idea?” 

“Run!” Carly Beth screamed. 

The two girls took off, running at full speed down the block. They didn’t 
stop until the house was out of sight. 

Sabrina grabbed Carly Beth’s shoulders and held on, struggling to catch her 
breath. “You’re crazy!” she gasped. “You’re really crazy!” 

“It takes one to know one,” Carly Beth said playfully. 

They both laughed. 

Carly Beth searched the block, looking for Chuck and Steve. She saw a 
small group of costumed kids huddled together at the corner. But no sign of the 
two boys. 

Smaller houses, jammed closer together, lined the two sides of this block. 
“Let’s split up,” Carly Beth suggested, leaning against the broomstick. “We’ll 
get more candy that way.” 

Sabrina frowned at her friend, eyeing her suspiciously. “Carly Beth, you 
don’t even like candy!” she exclaimed. 

But Carly Beth was already running up the driveway to the first house, her 
sculpted head bobbing wildly above her on its broomstick. 

This is my night, Carly Beth thought, accepting a candy bar from the 
smiling woman who answered the door. My night! 

She felt a tingle of excitement she’d never felt before. And a strange feeling 
she couldn’t describe. A hunger... 

A few minutes later, her shopping bag starting to feel heavy, she came to the 
end of the block. She hesitated on the corner, trying to decide whether to do the 
other side of the street or go on to the next block. 

It was very dark there, she realized. The moon had once again disappeared 
behind dark clouds. The corner streetlight was out, probably burned out. 

Across the street, four very young trick or treaters were giggling as they 
approached a house with a jack-o’-lantern on the porch. 

Carly Beth sank back into the darkness. She heard voices, boys’ voices. 

Chuck and Steve? 

No. The voices were unfamiliar. They were arguing about where to trick-or- 
treat next. One of them wanted to go home and call a friend. 

How about a little scare for you guys? Carly Beth thought, a smile 
spreading across her face. How about something to remember this Halloween 



night? 

She waited, listening, until they were a few feet away. She could see them 
now. Two mummies, their faces wrapped in gauze. 

Closer, closer. She waited for the perfect moment. 

Then she burst from the shadows, uttering an angry animal howl that 
shattered the air. 

The two boys gasped and jumped back. 

“Hey—!” One of them tried to shout, but his voice caught in his throat. 

The other one dropped his bag of candy. 

As he started to pick it up, Carly Beth moved quickly. She grabbed the bag 
from his hand, jerked it away from him, and started to run. 

“Come back!” 

“That’s minel” 

“Hey—” 

Their voices were high and shrill, filled with fear and surprise. As she ran 
across the street, Carly Beth glanced back to see if they were following her. 

No. They were too frightened. They stood huddled together on the corner, 
shouting after her. 

Holding the stolen candy bag tightly in her free hand, Carly Beth tossed 
back her head and laughed. A cruel laugh, a triumphant laugh. A laugh she had 
never heard before. 

She emptied the boy’s candy into her own bag, then tossed his bag onto the 
ground. 

She felt good, really good. Really strong. And ready for more fun. 

Come on, Chuck and Steve, she thought. It’s YOUR turn next! 



17 


Carly Beth found Chuck and Steve a few minutes later. 

They were across the street from her, standing in the light of someone’s 
driveway, examining the contents of their trick-or-treat bags. 

Carly Beth ducked behind the wide trunk of an old tree near the sidewalk. 
Her heart began to pound as she spied on them. 

Neither boy had bothered to put on a real costume. Chuck had a red 
bandanna tied around his head and a black mask over his eyes. Steve had 
blackened his cheeks and forehead with big smudges and wore an old tennis hat 
and a torn raincoat. 

Is he supposed to be a bum? Carly Beth wondered. 

She watched them sift through their bags. They had been out for quite a 
while, she saw. Their bags appeared pretty full. 

Suddenly, Steve glanced up in her direction. 

Carly Beth jerked her head back behind the tree trunk. 

Had he seen her? 

No. 

Don’t blow it now, she told herself. You’ve waited so long for this moment. 
You’ve waited so long to pay them back for all the scares. 

Carly Beth watched the two boys make their way up to the front porch of 
the next house. Nearly tripping over the broomstick, she darted away from the 
tree. She ran across the street and ducked low behind a hedge. 

When they come back down the drive, I’ll leap out. I’ll pounce on them. I’ll 
scare them to death, she thought. 

The low hedge smelled piney and sweet. It was still wet from the morning’s 
rain. The wind made the leaves tremble. What was that strange whistling sound? 

It took Carly Beth a while to realize it was her own breathing. 

She suddenly began to have doubts. 

This isn’t going to work, she thought, crouching lower behind the trembling 
hedge. 

I am a complete jerk. Chuck and Steve aren’t going to be scared by a stupid 
mask. 

I’m going to jump out at them, and they’re going to laugh at me. As they 



always do. 

They’re going to laugh and say, “Oh, hi, Carly Beth. Looking good!” Or 
something like that. 

And then they’ll tell everyone in school how I thought I was so scary and 
how they recognized me immediately and what a total jerk I am. And everyone 
will have a good laugh at my expense. 

Why did I ever think this would work? What made me think it was such a 
hot idea? 

Crouched behind the hedge, Carly Beth could feel her anger grow. Anger at 
herself. Anger at the two boys. 

Her face felt burning hot inside the ugly mask. Her heart thudded loudly. 
Her rapid breaths whistled against the flat nose. 

Chuck and Steve were approaching. She could hear their sneakers crunch 
over the gravel driveway. 

Carly Beth tensed her leg muscles and prepared to pounce. 

Okay, she thought, taking a deep breath, here goes! 



18 


It all seemed to happen in slow motion. 

The two boys moved slowly past the hedge. They were talking excitedly to 
each other. But to Carly Beth, their voices seemed low and far away. 

She pulled herself up, stepped out from the hedge, and screamed at the top 
of her lungs. 

Even in the dim light, she could see their reactions clearly. 

Their eyes went wide. Their mouths dropped open. Their hands shot up 
above their heads. 

Steve cried out. Chuck grabbed the sleeve of Steve’s coat. 

Carly Beth’s scream echoed over the dark front lawn. The sound seemed to 
hover in the air. 

Everything moved so slowly. So slowly, Carly Beth could see Chuck’s 
eyebrows quiver. She could see his chin tremble. 

She could see the fear shimmer in Steve’s eyes as they moved from her 
mask up to the head on the broomstick. 

She waved the broomstick menacingly. 

Steve uttered a frightened whimper. 

Chuck gaped at Carly Beth, his frightened eyes locked on hers. “Carly Beth 
—is that you?” he finally managed to choke out. 

Carly Beth uttered an animal growl, but didn’t reply. 

“Who are you?” Steve demanded, his voice trembling. 

“It—it’s Carly Beth—I think!” Chuck told him. “Is it you in there, Carly 
Beth?” 

Steve let out a tense laugh. “You—scared us!” 

“Carly Beth—is it you?” Chuck demanded again. 

Carly Beth waved the broomstick. She pointed up to the head. “That’s Carly 
Beth’s head,” she told them. Her voice was a deep, throaty rasp. 

“Huh?” Both boys gazed up at it uncertainly. 

“That’s Carly Beth’s head,” she repeated slowly, waving it toward them. 
The painted eyes of the sculpted face appeared to glare down at them. “Poor 
Carly Beth didn’t want to give up her head tonight. But I took it anyway.” 



Both boys stared up at the head. 

Chuck continued to grip Steve’s coat sleeve. 

Steve uttered another tense laugh. He stared at Carly Beth, his expression 
confused. “You’re Carly Beth, right? How are you making that weird voice?” 

“That’s your friend Carly Beth,” she growled, pointing up to the head on 
the broomstick. “That’s all that’s left of her!” 

Chuck swallowed hard. His eyes were trained on the bobbing head. Steve 
stared intently at Carly Beth’s mask. 

“Hand over your candy,” Carly Beth snarled, surprised by the vicious tone 
in her voice. 

“Huh?” Steve cried. 

“Hand it over. Now. Or I’ll put your heads on the stick.” 

Both boys laughed, shrill giggles. 

“I’m not joking!” Carly Beth roared. 

Her angry words cut their laughter short. 

“Carly Beth—give us a break,” Chuck muttered uncertainly, his eyes still 
narrowed in fear. 

“Yeah. Really,” Steve said softly. 

“Hand over your bags,” Carly Beth insisted coldly. “Or your heads will 
adorn my stick.” 

She lowered the broomstick toward them menacingly. 

And as she lowered it, all three of them stared up at the dark-eyed face. All 
three of them studied the frozen face, the face that looked so real, that looked so 
much like Carly Beth Caldwell. 

A sudden breeze swirled around them, making the head bob on the stick. 

And then, all three of them saw the eyes blink. 

Once. Twice. 

The brown eyes blinked. 

And the lips on the head parted, making a dry scraping sound. 

Frozen in horror, Carly Beth stared up at the face along with the two boys. 

And all three of them saw the lips move. And heard the dry, crackling 
sound. 

All three of them saw the dark lips squeeze together, then part. 

All three of them saw the bobbing head form the silent words: “Help me. 
Help me. ” 



19 


In her horror, Carly Beth let go of the broomstick. It hit the ground beside 
Chuck. The head rolled under the hedge. 

“It—it talked !” Steve cried. 

Chuck uttered a low whimper. 

Without another word, both boys dropped their candy bags and took off, 
their sneakers thudding loudly on the sidewalk. 

The wind swirled around Carly Beth as if holding her in place. 

She felt like tossing her head back and howling. 

She felt like tearing off her coat and flying through the night. 

She felt like climbing a tree, leaping onto a roof, roaring up at the starless, 
black sky. 

She stood frozen for a long moment, letting the wind sweep around her. The 
boys were gone. They had fled in terror. 

Terror! 

Carly Beth had succeeded. She had scared them nearly to death. 

She knew she’d never forget the horrified looks on their faces, the fear and 
disbelief that glowed in their dark eyes. 

And she would never forget her feeling of triumph. The thrilling sweetness 
of revenge. 

For a brief moment, she realized, she had felt the fear, too. 

She had imagined that the head on the stick had come to life, had blinked its 
eyes, had spoken silently to them. 

For a brief moment, she had caught the fear. She had fallen under the spell 
of her own trickery. 

But, of course, the head hadn’t come alive, she assured herself now. Of 
course the lips hadn’t moved, hadn’t made their silent plea: “Help me. Help me. ” 

It had to be shadows, she knew. Shadows cast by the light of the moon, 
floating out from behind the shifting, black clouds. 

Where was the head? 

Where was the broomstick she had dropped? 

It didn’t matter now. They were no longer of any use to her. 



Carly Beth had won her victory. 

And now she was running. Running wildly over the front lawns. Jumping 
over shrubs and hedges. Flying over the dark, hard ground. 

She was running blindly, the houses whirring past on both sides. The 
blustery wind swirled, and she swirled with it, rising over the sidewalks, rushing 
through tall weeds, blowing with the wind like a helpless leaf. 

Holding her bulging candy bag, she ran past startled trick or treaters, past 
glowing pumpkins, past rattling skeletons. 

She ran until her breath gave out. 

Then she stopped, panting loudly, and shut her eyes, waiting for her heart to 
stop pounding, for the blood to stop pulsing at her temples. 

And a hand grabbed her shoulder roughly from behind. 



20 


Startled, Carly Beth shrieked and spun around. “Sabrina!” she cried breathlessly. 

Grinning, Sabrina let go of her shoulder. “I’ve been looking for you for 
hours,” Sabrina scolded. “Where’d you go?” 

“I—I guess I got lost,” Carly Beth replied, still struggling to catch her 
breath. 

“One minute you were there. The next minute, you disappeared,” Sabrina 
said, adjusting her mask over her dark hair. 

“How’d you do?” Carly Beth asked, trying to speak in her normal voice. 

“I ripped my catsuit,” Sabrina complained, frowning. She pulled at the 
Lycra material on one leg to show Carly Beth. “Snagged it on a stupid mailbox.” 

“Bad news,” Carly Beth sympathized. 

“Did you scare anyone with that mask?” Sabrina demanded, still fingering 
the tear in the catsuit leg. 

“Yeah. A few kids,” Carly Beth replied casually. 

“It’s really gross,” Sabrina said. 

“That’s why I picked it.” 

They both laughed. 

“Did you get a lot of candy?” Sabrina asked. She picked up Carly Beth’s 
bag and looked inside. “Wow! What a haul!” 

“I hit a lot of houses,” Carly Beth said. 

“Let’s go back to my house and check out the loot,” Sabrina suggested. 

“Yeah. Okay.” Carly Beth followed her friend across the street. 

“Unless you want to trick-or-treat some more,” Sabrina offered, stopping in 
the middle of the street. 

“No. I’ve done enough,” Carly Beth said. She laughed to herself. I did 
everything I wanted to do tonight. 

They started walking again. They were walking against the wind, but Carly 
Beth didn’t feel at all chilled. 

Two girls in frilly dresses, their faces brightly made up, funny, blonde, 
moplike wigs on their heads, ran by. One of them slowed when she caught sight 
of Carly Beth’s mask. She uttered a soft gasp, then hurried after her friend. 



“Did you see Steve and Chuck?” Sabrina asked. “I searched everywhere for 
them.” She groaned. “That’s all I did tonight. I spent the whole night looking for 
everybody. You. Steve and Chuck. How come we never got together?” 

Carly Beth shrugged. “I saw them,” she told her friend. “A few minutes 
ago. Back there.” She motioned with her head. “They’re such scaredy-cats.” 

“Huh? Steve and Chuck?” Sabrina’s expression turned to surprise. 

“Yeah. They got one look at my mask and they took off,” Carly Beth told 
her, laughing. “They were screaming like babies.” 

Sabrina joined in the laughter. “I don’t believe it!” she exclaimed. “They 
always act so tough. And—” 

“I called after them, but they just kept running,” Carly Beth told her, 
grinning. 

“Weird!” Sabrina declared. 

“Yeah. Weird,” Carly Beth agreed. 

“Did they know it was you?” Sabrina asked. 

Carly Beth shrugged. “I don’t know. They took one look at me, and they ran 
like rabbits.” 

“They told me they planned to scare you,” Sabrina revealed. “They were 
going to sneak up behind you and make scary noises or something.” 

Carly Beth snickered. “It’s hard to sneak up behind someone when you’re 
running for your life!” 

Sabrina’s house came into view. Carly Beth shifted the candy bag to her 
other hand. 

“I got some good stuff,” Sabrina said, peering into her bag as she walked. “I 
had to get a lot. I have to share it with my cousin. She has the flu and couldn’t 
trick-or-treat tonight.” 

“I’m not sharing any of mine,” Carly Beth said. “Noah went out with his 
pals. He’ll probably come home with a year’s supply.” 

“Mrs. Connelly gave cookies and popcorn again this year,” Sabrina said, 
sighing. “I’ll just have to throw it all out. Mom won’t let me eat anything that 
isn’t wrapped. She’s afraid some ghoul will put poison in it. I had to throw out a 
lot of good stuff last year.” 

Sabrina knocked on her front door. A few seconds later, her mother opened 
it and the girls entered. “That’s some mask, Carly Beth,” she said, studying it. 
“How’d you girls do?” 

“Okay, I think,” Sabrina replied. 



“Well, just remember—” 

“I know. I know, Mom,” Sabrina interrupted impatiently. “Throw out 
everything that isn’t wrapped. Even the fruit.” 

As soon as Mrs. Mason had gone back to the den, the two girls turned over 
their bags and dumped all the candy onto the living room rug. 

“Hey, look—a big Milky Way!” Sabrina declared, pulling it out of the pile. 
“My favorite!” 

“I hate these!” Carly Beth said, holding up an enormous blue jawbreaker. 
“The last time I tried sucking one of these, I cut my tongue to pieces.” She 
tossed it onto Sabrina’s pile. 

“Thanks a bunch,” Sabrina said sarcastically. She tugged off her mask and 
dropped it onto the carpet. Her face was flushed. She shook out her black hair. 

“There. That feels better,” Sabrina said. “Wow. That mask was hot.” She 
raised her eyes to Carly Beth. “Don’t you want to take off your mask? You must 
be boiling inside it!” 

“Yeah. Good idea.” Carly Beth had actually forgotten she was wearing a 
mask. 

She reached up with both hands and tugged at the ears. “Ouch!” The mask 
didn’t budge. 

She pulled it by the top of the head. Then she tried stretching it out and 
tugging it from the cheeks. 

“Ouch!” 

“What’s wrong?” Sabrina asked, concentrating on sorting her candy into 
piles. 

Carly Beth didn’t reply. She tried prying the mask off at the neck. Then she 
tugged it up by the ears again. 

“Carly Beth—what’s wrong?” Sabrina asked, looking up from her candy. 

“Help me!” Carly Beth pleaded in a shrill, frightened voice. “Please—help 
me! The mask—it won’t come off!” 



21 


On her knees on the carpet, Sabrina glanced up from her piles of candy bars. 
“Carly Beth, stop clowning around.” 

“I’m not!” Carly Beth insisted, her voice shrill with panic. 

“Aren’t you tired of scaring people tonight?” Sabrina demanded. She 
picked up a clear plastic bag of candy corn. “Wonder if Mom will let me keep 
this. It’s wrapped.” 

“I’m not trying to scare you. I’m serious!” Carly Beth cried. She tugged at 
the ears of the mask, but couldn’t get a good grip. 

Sabrina tossed down the bag of candy corn and climbed to her feet. “You 
really can’t get the mask off?” 

Carly Beth pulled hard on the chin. “Ouch!” She cried out in pain. “It—it’s 
stuck to my skin or something. Help me.” 

Sabrina laughed. “We’re going to look pretty stupid if we have to call the 
fire department to get you out of your mask!” 

Carly Beth didn’t find it funny. She gripped the top of the mask with both 
hands and pulled with all her strength. The mask didn’t budge. 

Sabrina’s grin faded. She stepped over to her friend. “You’re not goofing 
—are you. You’re really stuck.” 

Carly Beth nodded. “Well, come on,” she urged impatiently. “Help me pull 
it off.” 

Sabrina grabbed the mask top. “It’s so warm!” she exclaimed. “You must be 
suffocating in there.” 

“Just pull!” Carly Beth wailed. 

Sabrina pulled. 

“Ouch! Not so hard!” Carly Beth cried. “It really hurts!” 

Sabrina pulled more gently, but the mask didn’t budge. She lowered her 
hands to the cheeks and pulled. 

“Ouch!” Carly Beth shrieked. “It’s really stuck to my face.” 

“What’s this thing made of?” Sabrina asked, staring intently at the mask. “It 
doesn’t feel like rubber. It feels like skin.” 

“I don’t know what it’s made of, and I don’t care,” Carly Beth grumbled. “I 
just want it off. Maybe we should cut it off. You know. With scissors.” 



“And wreck the mask?” Sabrina asked. 

“I don’t care!” Carly Beth exclaimed, tugging furiously on it. “I really 
don’t! I just want out! If I don’t get this thing off me, I’m going to freak out. I’m 
serious!” 

Sabrina put a calming hand on her friend’s shoulder. “Okay. Okay. One 
more try. Then we’ll cut it off.” 

She narrowed her eyes as she examined the mask. “I should be able to reach 
underneath it and pull it away,” she said, thinking out loud. “If I slip my hands 
up through the neck, I can stretch it out and then push it up.” 

“Well, go ahead. Just hurry!” Carly Beth pleaded. 

But Sabrina didn’t move. Her dark eyes grew wide, and her mouth dropped 
open as she studied the mask. She uttered a soft gasp of surprise. 

“Sabrina? What’s the matter?” Carly Beth demanded. 

Sabrina didn’t reply. Instead, she ran her fingers over Carly Beth’s throat. 

Her astonished expression remained frozen on her face. She moved behind 
Carly Beth and ran her fingers along the back of Carly Beth’s neck. 

“What is it? What’s the matter?” Carly Beth demanded shrilly. 

Sabrina ran a hand back through her black hair. Her forehead wrinkled in 
concentration. “Carly Beth,” she said finally, “there’s something very weird 
going on here.” 

“What? What are you talking about?” Carly Beth demanded. 

“There’s no bottom to the mask.” 

“Huh?” Carly Beth’s hands shot up to her neck. She felt around frantically. 
“What do you mean?” 

“There’s no line,” Sabrina told her in a trembling voice. “There’s no line 
between the mask and your skin. No place to slip my hand in.” 

“But that’s crazy!” Carly Beth cried. She moved her hands to her throat, 
pushing up the skin, feeling for the bottom of the mask. “That’s crazy! Just 
crazy!” 

Sabrina raised her hands to her face, her features tight with horror. 

“That’s crazy! Crazy!” Carly Beth repeated in a high-pitched, frightened 
voice. 

But as her trembling fingers desperately explored her neck, Carly Beth 
realized that her friend was right. 

There was no longer a bottom to the mask. No place where the mask ended. 
No opening between the mask and Carly Beth’s skin. 



The mask had become her face. 



22 


Carly Beth’s legs trembled as she made her way to the mirror in the front 
entryway. Her hands still frantically searched her throat as she stepped up to the 
large, rectangular wall mirror and brought her face close to the glass. 

“No line!” she cried. “No mask line!” 

Sabrina stood a few feet back, her expression troubled. “I—I don’t 
understand it,” she muttered, staring at Carly Beth’s reflection. 

Carly Beth uttered a sharp gasp. “Those aren’t my eyes!” she screamed. 

“Huh?” Sabrina stepped up beside her, still staring into the mirror. 

“Those aren’t my eyes!” Carly Beth wailed. “My eyes don’t look like that.” 

“Try to calm down,” Sabrina urged softly. “Your eyes—” 

“They’re not mine! Not mine!” Carly Beth cried, ignoring her friend’s plea 
for calm. “Where are my eyes? Where am /? Where am I, Sabrina? This isn’t me 
in here!” 

“Carly Beth—please calm down!” Sabrina urged. But her voice came out 
choked and frightened. 

“It isn’t me!” Carly Beth declared, gaping in open-mouthed horror at her 
reflection, her hands pressed tightly against the grotesquely wrinkled cheeks of 
the mask. “It isn’t me!” 

Sabrina reached out to her friend. But Carly Beth pulled away. With a high- 
pitched wail, a cry of horror and despair, she flung herself through the hallway. 
She pulled open the front door, struggling with the lock, sobbing loudly. 

“Carly Beth—stop! Come back!” 

Ignoring Sabrina’s pleas, Carly Beth plunged back into the darkness. The 
storm door slammed behind her. 

As she began to run, she could hear Sabrina’s frantic cries from the 
doorway: “Carly Beth—your coat! Come back! You forgot your coat!” 

Carly Beth’s sneakers thudded over the hard ground. She ran into the 
darkness beneath the trees, as if trying to hide, as if trying to keep her hideous 
face from view. 

She reached the sidewalk, turned right, and kept running. 

She had no idea where she was going. She only knew she had to run away 
from Sabrina, away from the mirror. 



She wanted to run away from herself, away from her face, the hideous face 
that had stared back at her in the mirror with those frightening, unfamiliar eyes. 

Someone else’s eyes. Someone else’s eyes in her head. 

Only it was no longer her head. It was an ugly green monster head that had 
attached itself to hers. 

Uttering another cry of panic, Carly Beth crossed the street and kept 
running. The dark trees, black against the starless night sky, swayed and shivered 
overhead. Houses whirred past, a blur of orange light from their windows. 

Into the darkness she ran, breathing noisily through the ugly, flat nose. She 
lowered her smooth, green head against the wind and stared at the ground as she 
ran. 

But no matter where she turned her gaze, she saw the mask. She saw the 
face staring back at her, the ugly, puckered skin, the glowing orange eyes, the 
rows of jagged animal teeth. 

My face... my face... 

High-pitched screams startled her from her thoughts. 

Carly Beth glanced up to see that she had run into a group of trick or 
treaters. There were six or seven of them, all turned toward her, screaming and 
pointing. 

She opened her mouth wide, revealing the sharp fangs, and growled at 
them, a deep animal growl. 

The growl made them grow silent. They stared hard at her, trying to decide 
if she was threatening them or only kidding. 

“What are you supposed to be?” a girl in a red-and-white mffled clown 
costume called to her. 

I’m supposed to be ME, but I’m not! Carly Beth thought bitterly. 

She ignored the question. Lowering her head, turning away from them, she 
started to run again. 

She could hear them laughing now. They were laughing in relief, she knew, 
glad she was leaving them. 

With a bitter sob, she turned the corner and kept running. 

Where am I going? What am I doing? Am I going to keep running forever? 

The questions roared through her mind. 

She stopped short when the party store came into view. 

Of course, she thought. The party store. 

The strange man in the cape. He will help me. He will know what to do. 



The man in the cape will know how to get this mask off. 

Feeling a surge of hope, Carly Beth jogged toward the store. 

But as she neared it, her hope dimmed as dark as the store window. 
Through the glass she could see that all the lights were out. The store was as 
dark as the night. It was closed. 



23 


As she stared into the darkened store, a wave of despair swept over Carly Beth. 

Her hands raised against the window, she pressed her head against the glass. 
It felt cool against her hot forehead. The mask’s hot forehead. 

She closed her eyes. 

What do I do now? What am I going to do? 

“It’s all a bad dream,” she murmured out loud. “A bad dream. I’m going to 
open my eyes now, and wake up.” 

She opened her eyes. She could see her eyes, her glowing orange eyes, 
reflected in the dark window glass. 

She could see her grotesque face, staring darkly back at her. 

“Noooo!” With a shudder that shook her entire body, Carly Beth slammed 
her fists against the window. 

Why didn’t I wear my mother’s duck costume? 

she asked herself angrily. Why was I so determined to be the scariest 
creature that ever roamed on Halloween? Why was I so determined to terrify 
Chuck and Steve? 

She swallowed hard. Now I’m going to scare people for the rest of my life. 

As the bitter thoughts rolled through her mind, Carly Beth suddenly became 
aware of movement inside the store. She saw a dark shadow roll over the floor. 
She heard footsteps. 

The door rattled, then opened a few inches. 

The store owner poked his head out. His eyes narrowed as they studied 
Carly Beth. “I stayed late,” he said quietly. “I expected to see you again.” 

Carly Beth was startled by his calmness. “I—I can’t get it off!” she 
sputtered. She tugged at the top of her head to demonstrate. 

“I know,” the man said. His expression didn’t change. “Come inside.” He 
pushed the door open the rest of the way, then stepped back. 

Carly Beth hesitated, then walked quickly into the dark store. It was very 
warm inside. 

The owner turned on a single light above the front counter. He was no 
longer wearing the cape, Carly Beth saw. He wore black suit pants and a white 
dress shirt. 



“You knew I’d come back?” Carly Beth demanded shrilly. The raspy voice 
she had acquired inside the mask revealed both anger and confusion. “How did 
you know?” 

“I didn’t want to sell it to you,” he replied, staring at the mask. He shook his 
head, frowning. “You remember, don’t you? You remember that I didn’t want to 
sell it to you?” 

“I remember,” Carly Beth replied impatiently. “Just help me take it off. 
Okay? Help me.” 

He stared hard at her. He didn’t reply. 

“Help me take it off,” Carly Beth insisted, shouting. “I want you to take it 

off!” 

He sighed. “I can’t,” he told her sadly. “I can’t take it off. I’m really sorry.” 



24 


“Wh-what do you mean?” Carly Beth stammered. 

The store owner didn’t reply. He turned toward the back of the store and 
motioned for her to follow him. 

“Answer me!” Carly Beth shrieked. “Don’t walk away! Answer me! What 
do you mean the mask can’t be taken off?” 

She followed him into the back room, her heart pounding. He clicked on the 

light. 

Carly Beth blinked in the sudden brightness. The two long shelves of 
hideous masks came into focus. She saw a bare spot on the shelf where hers had 
stood. 

The grotesque masks all seemed to stare at her. She forced herself to look 
away from them. “Take this mask off—now!” she demanded, moving to block 
the store owner’s path. 

“I can’t remove it,” he repeated softly, almost sadly. 

“Why not?” Carly Beth demanded. 

He lowered his voice. “Because it isn’t a mask.” 

Carly Beth gaped at him. She opened her mouth, but no sound came out. 

“It isn’t a mask,” he told her. “It’s a real face.” 

Carly Beth suddenly felt dizzy. The floor tilted. The rows of ugly faces 
glared at her. All of the bulging, bloodshot, yellow and green eyes seemed to be 
trained on her. 

She pressed her back against the wall and tried to steady herself. 

The store owner walked over to the display shelf and gestured to the ugly, 
staring heads. “The Unloved,” he said sadly, his voice lowered to a whisper. 

“I—I don’t understand,” Carly Beth managed to choke out. 

“These are not masks. They are faces,” he explained. “Real faces. I made 
them. I created them in my lab—real faces.” 

“But—but they are so ugly—” Carly Beth started. “Why—?” 

“They weren’t ugly in the beginning,” he intermpted, his voice bitter, his 
eyes angry. “They were beautiful. And they were alive. But something went 
wrong. When they were taken out of the lab, they changed. My experiments— 
my poor heads—were a failure. But I had to keep them alive. I had to.” 



“I—I don’t believe it!” Carly Beth exclaimed breathlessly, raising her hands 
to the sides of her face, her green, distorted face. “I don’t believe any of it.” 

“I am telling the truth,” the store owner continued, running a finger over 
one side of his narrow mustache, his eyes burning into Carly Beth’s. “I keep 
them here. I call them The Unloved because no one will ever want to see them. 
Occasionally, someone wanders into the back room—you, for example—and 
one of my faces finds a new home....” 

“Nooooo!” Carly Beth uttered a cry of protest, more an animal wail than a 
human cry. 

She stared at the gnarled, twisted faces on the shelf. The bulging heads, the 
open wounds, the animal fangs. Monsters! All monsters! 

“Take this off!” she screamed, losing control. “Take this off! Take it off!” 

She began tearing frantically at her face, trying to pull it off, trying to rip it 
off in pieces. 

“Take it off! Take it off!” 

He raised a hand to quiet her. “I am sorry. The face is your face now,” he 
said without expression. 

“No!” Carly Beth shrieked again in her new, raspy voice. “Take it off! Take 
it off—NOW!” 

She tore at the face. But even in her anger and panic, she knew her actions 
were useless. 

“The face can be removed,” the store owner told her, speaking softly. 

“Huh?” Carly Beth lowered her hands. She stared hard at him. “What did 
you say?” 

“I said there is one way the face can be removed.” 

“Yes?” Carly Beth felt a powerful chill run down her back, a chill of hope. 
“Yes? How? Tell me!” she pleaded. “Please—tell me!” 

“I cannot do it for you,” he replied, frowning. “But I can tell you how. 
However, if it ever again attaches itself to you or to another person, it will be 
forever.” 

“How do I get it off? Tell me! Tell me!” Carly Beth begged. “How do I get 
it off?” 



25 


The light flickered overhead. The rows of bloated, distorted faces continued to 
stare at Carly Beth. 

Monsters, she thought. 

It’s a room full of monsters, waiting to come alive. 

And now I’m one of them. 

Now I’m a monster, too. 

The floorboards creaked as the store owner moved away from the display 
shelves and came up close to Carly Beth. 

“How do I get this off me?” she pleaded. “Tell me. Show me—now!” 

“It can only be removed once,” he repeated softly. “And it can only be 
removed by a symbol of love.” 

She stared at him, waiting for him to continue. 

The silence filled the room. Heavy silence. 

“I—I don’t understand,” Carly Beth stammered finally. “You’ve got to help 
me. I don’t understand you! Tell me something that makes sense! Help me!” 

“I can say no more,” he said, lowering his head, shutting his eyes, and 
wearily rubbing his eyelids with his fingers. 

“But—what do you mean by a symbol of love?” Carly Beth demanded. She 
grabbed the front of his shirt with both hands. “What do you mean? What do you 
mean?” 

He made no attempt to remove her hands. “I can say no more,” he repeated 
in a whisper. 

“No!” she shouted. “No! You have to help me! You have to!” 

She could feel her rage explode, could feel herself burst out of control—but 
she couldn’t stop herself. 

“I want my face back!” she shrieked, pounding on his chest with both fists. 
“I want my face back! I want myself back!” 

She was screaming at the top of her lungs now, but she didn’t care. 

The store owner backed away, motioning with both hands for her to be 
quiet. Then, suddenly, his eyes opened wide in fear. 

Carly Beth followed his gaze to the display shelves. 



“Ohh!” She uttered a startled cry of horror as she saw the rows of faces all 
begin to move. 

Bulging eyes blinked. Swollen tongues licked at dry lips. Dark wounds 
began to pulsate. 

The heads were all bobbing, blinking, breathing. 

“What—what is happening?” Carly Beth cried in a trembling whisper. 
“You’ve awakened them all!” he cried, his expression as frightened as hers. 
“But—but—” 

“Run!” he screamed, giving her a hard shove toward the doorway. “Run!” 



26 


Carly Beth hesitated. She turned back to stare at the heads bobbing on the 
shelves. 

Fat, dark lips began to move, making wet sucking sounds. Crooked fangs 
clicked up and down. Ugly, inhuman noses twitched and gasped air noisily. 

The heads, two long rows of them, throbbed to life. 

And the eyes—the blood-veined, bulging eyes—the green eyes, the sickly 
yellow eyes, the bright scarlet eyes, the disgusting eyeballs hanging by threads 
—they were all on her! 

“Run! You’ve awakened them!” the store owner screamed, his voice 
choked with fear. “Run! Get away from here!” 

Carly Beth wanted to run. But her legs wouldn’t cooperate. Her knees felt 
wobbly and weak. She suddenly felt as if she weighed a thousand pounds. 

“Run! Runl” The store owner repeated his frantic cry. 

But she couldn’t take her eyes off the throbbing, twitching heads. 

Carly Beth gaped at the hideous scene, frozen in terror, feeling her legs turn 
to Jell-O, feeling her breath catch in her throat. And as she watched, the heads 
rose up and floated into the air. 

“Run! Hurry! Run!” 

The store owner’s voice seemed far away now. 

The heads began to jabber in rumbling, deep voices, drowning out his 
frantic cries. They murmured excitedly, making only sounds, no words, like a 
chorus of frogs. 

Up, up, they floated, as Carly Beth stared in silent horror. 

“Run! Run!” 

Yes. 

She turned. She forced her legs to move. 

And with a burst of energy, she began to run. 

She ran through the dimly lit front room of the store. Her hands grabbed for 
the doorknob, and she pulled open the door. 

A second later, she was out on the sidewalk, running through the darkness. 
Her sneakers thudded loudly on the pavement. She felt a shock of cold air 
against her hot face. 



Her hot, green face. 

Her monster face. 

The monster face she could not remove. 

She crossed the street and kept running. 

What was that sound? That deep, gurgling sound? That low murmur that 
seemed to be following her? 

Following her? 

“Oh, no!” Carly Beth cried out as she glanced back—and saw the gruesome 
heads flying after her. 

A ghoulish parade. 

They flew in single file, one long chain of throbbing, jabbering heads. Their 
eyes glowed brightly, as bright as car headlights, and they were all trained on 
Carly Beth. 

Choked with fear, Carly Beth stumbled over the curb. 

Her arms shot forward as she struggled to regain her balance. Her legs 
wanted to collapse, but she forced them to move again. 

Bent into the wind, she ran, past dark houses and empty lots. 

It must be late, she realized. It must be very late. 

Too late. 

The words flashed into her mind. 

Too late for me. 

The hideous, glowing heads flew after her. Getting closer. Closer. The 
rumbling of their animal murmurs grew louder in her ears until the frightening 
sound seemed to surround her. 

The wind roared, gusting hard, as if deliberately pushing her back. 

The murmuring heads floated closer. 

I’m running through a dark nightmare, she thought. 

I may run forever. 

Too late. Too late for me. 

Or was it? 

An idea formed its way through her nightmarish panic. As she ran, her arms 
thrashing the air in front of her as if reaching for safety, her mind struggled for a 
solution, an escape. 

A symbol of love. 

She heard the store owner’s words over the rumble of ugly voices behind 


her. 



A symbol of love. 

That’s what it would take to rid her of the monster head that had become 
her own. 

Would it also stop the throbbing, glowing heads that pursued her? Would it 
send the faces of The Unloved back to where they came from? 

Gasping loudly for breath, Carly Beth turned the corner and kept running. 
Glancing back, she could see her chattering pursuers turn, too. 

Where am I? she wondered, turning her eyes to the houses she was passing. 

She had been too frightened to care where she ran. 

But, now, Carly Beth had an idea. A desperate idea. 

And she had to get there before the gruesome parade of heads caught up 
with her. 

She had a symbol of love. 

It was her head. The plaster of Paris head her mother had sculpted of her. 

Carly Beth remembered asking her mother why she had sculpted it. And her 
mother had replied, “Because I love you.” Maybe it could save her. Maybe it 
could help her out of this nightmare. 

But where was it? 

She had tossed it aside. She had let it fall behind a hedge. She had left it in 
someone’s yard, and— 

And now she was back on the block. 

She recognized the street. She recognized the houses. 

This was where she had met up with Chuck and Steve. This is where she 
had sent them running off in terror. 

But where was the house? Where was the hedge? 

Her eyes darted frantically from yard to yard. 

Behind her, she saw, the heads had swarmed together. Like buzzing bees, 
they had bunched together, grinning now, grinning hideous, wet grins as they 
prepared to close in on her. 

I’ve got to find the head! Carly Beth told herself, struggling to breathe, 
struggling to keep her aching legs moving. 

I’ve got to find my head. 

The rumbling, jabbering voices grew louder. The heads swarmed closer. 

“Where? Where?” she screamed aloud. 

And then she saw the tall hedge. Across the street. 

The yard across the street. 



The head, the beautiful head—she had let it fall behind that hedge. 

Could she get to it before the ugly heads swarmed over her? 

Yes! 

Sucking in a deep breath of air, her arms reaching out desperately in front 
of her, she turned and ran across the street. 

And dove behind the hedge. Onto her hands and knees. Her chest heaving. 
Her breath rasping. Her head pounding. 

She reached for the head. 

It was gone. 



27 


Gone. 

The head was gone. 

My last chance, Carly Beth thought, searching blindly, her hand thrashing 
frantically through the bottom of the hedge. 

Gone. 

Too late for me. 

Still on her knees, she turned to face her ghoulish pursuers. The heads, 
jabbering their mindless sounds, rose up in front of her, forming a wall. 

Carly Beth started to her feet. 

The throbbing wall of monster heads inched closer. 

She turned, searching for an escape route. 

And saw it. 

Saw her head. 

Saw the plaster of Paris head staring up at her from between two upraised 
roots on the big tree near the driveway. 

The wind must have blown it over there, she realized. 

And as the ugly heads bobbed closer, she dove for the tree. And grabbed the 
head with both hands. 

With a cry of triumph, she turned the sculpted face toward the jabbering 
heads and raised it high. 

“Go away! Go away!” Carly Beth screamed, holding the head up so they 
could all see it. “This is a symbol of love! This is a symbol of love! Go away!” 

The heads bobbed together. The glowing eyes stared at the sculpted head. 

They murmured excitedly. Wet smiles formed on their distorted lips. 

“Go away! Go away!” 

Carly Beth heard them laugh. Low, scornful laughter. 

Then they moved quickly, surrounding her, eager to swallow her up.

Too late for me. 

The words repeated in Carly Beth’s mind. 

Her idea had failed. 

The heads swarmed around her, drooled over her, eyes bulging gleefully in 
triumph. 

Their rumbling murmurs became a roar. She felt herself being swallowed 
up in their foul-smelling heat. 

Without thinking, she lowered the sculpted head. And pulled it down hard 
over her hideous monster head. 

To her surprise, it slid over her like a mask. 

I’m wearing my own face like a mask, she thought bitterly. 

As she pulled it over her, darkness descended. 

There were no eyeholes. She couldn’t see out. 

She couldn’t hear. 

What will the gruesome heads do to me? she wondered, alone with her fear. 

Will I become one of The Unloved now? 

Will I end up on display on a shelf along with them? 

Surrounded by the tight, silent darkness, Carly Beth waited. 

And waited. 

She could feel the blood pulsing at her temples. She could feel the throb of 
fear in her chest, the ache of her dry throat. 

What are they going to do? 

What are they doing ? 

She couldn’t bear being alone, shut in with her fear, surrounded by silence 
and the dark. 

With a hard tug, she pulled off the sculpted head. 

The gruesome heads were gone. 

Vanished. 

Carly Beth stared straight ahead in disbelief. Then her eyes darted around 
the shadowy lawn. She searched the trees and shrubs. She squinted into the dark 
spaces between the houses. 



Gone. 

They were gone. 

For a long moment, Carly Beth sat in the cold, wet grass, the sculpted head 
in her lap, breathing hard, staring across the silent, empty front yards. 

Soon her breathing returned to normal. She climbed to her feet. 

The wind had gentled. The pale half-moon slipped out from behind the dark 
clouds that had covered it. 

Carly Beth felt something flap against her throat. 

Startled, she reached up and felt the bottom of the mask. 

The bottom of the mask? 

Yes! 

There was a gap between the mask and her neck. 

“Hey!” she cried aloud. Setting the sculpted head down gently at her feet, 
she raised both hands to the bottom of the mask and pulled up. 

The mask came off easily. 

Stunned, she lowered it and held it in front of her. She folded it up, then 
unfolded it. 

The orange eyes that had glowed like fire had faded. The pointed animal 
fangs had become rubbery and limp. 

“You’re just a mask!” she cried aloud. “Just a mask again!” 

Laughing gleefully, she tossed it up in the air and caught it. 

It can be removed only once, the store owner had told her. 

Only once by a symbol of love. 

Well, I’ve done it! Carly Beth told herself happily. I’ve removed it. And 
don’t worry—I’ll never put it on again! 

Never! 

She suddenly felt exhausted. 

I’ve got to get home, she told herself. It’s probably close to midnight. 

Most of the houses were dark. There were no cars moving on the streets. 
The trick or treaters had all gone home. 

Carly Beth bent to pick up the sculpted head. Then, carrying the mask and 
the plaster head, she began walking quickly toward her house. 

Halfway up the driveway, she stopped. 

She reached up and examined her face with one hand. 

Do I have my old face back? she wondered. 

She rubbed her cheeks, then ran her fingers over her nose. 



Is it my old face? Do I look like me? 

She couldn’t tell just by touching. 

“I’ve got to get to a mirror!” she exclaimed out loud. 

Desperate to see if her face had returned to normal, she ran up to her front 
door and rang the bell. 

After a few seconds the door swung open, and Noah appeared. He pushed 
open the storm door. 

Then he raised his eyes to her face—and started to scream. 

“Take off that mask! Take it off! You’re so ugly!!” 



29 


“No!” Carly Beth cried in horror. 

The mask must have changed her face, she realized. 

“No! Oh, no!” 

She pushed past her brother, tossed down the head and the mask, and ran to 
the hallway mirror. 

Her face stared back at her. 

Perfectly normal. Her old face. Her good old face. 

Her dark brown eyes. Her broad forehead. Her snip of a nose, which she 
had always wished was longer. 

I’ll never complain about my nose again, she thought happily. 

Her face was normal again. All normal. 

As she stared at herself, she could hear Noah laughing at the doorway. 

She spun around angrily. “Noah—how could you?” 

He laughed harder. “It was just a joke. I can’t believe you fell for it.” 

“It was no joke to me!” Carly Beth exclaimed angrily. 

Her mother appeared at the end of the hall. “Carly Beth, where have you 
been? I expected you back an hour ago.” 

“Sorry, Mom,” Carly Beth replied, grinning. 

I’m so happy, I may never stop grinning! she thought. 

“It’s sort of a long story,” she told her mother. “Sort of a long, weird story.” 

“But you’re okay?” Mrs. Caldwell’s eyes narrowed as she studied her 
daughter. 

“Yeah. I’m okay,” Carly Beth said. 

“Come into the kitchen,” Mrs. Caldwell instructed her. “I have some nice 
hot cider for you.” 

Carly Beth obediently followed her mother to the kitchen. The kitchen was 
warm and bright. The sweet cider aroma filled the room. 

Carly Beth had never been so glad to be home in all her life. She hugged 
her mother, then took a seat at the counter. 

“Why didn’t you wear your duck costume?” Mrs. Caldwell asked, pouring 
out a cup of steaming cider. “Where have you been? Why weren’t you with 



Sabrina? Sabrina has called twice already, wondering what happened to you.” 
“Well...” Carly Beth began. “It’s sort of a long story, Mom.” 

“I’m not going anywhere,” her mother said, setting the cup of cider down in 
front of Carly Beth. She leaned against the counter, resting her chin in one hand. 
“Go ahead. Talk.” 

“Well...” Carly Beth hesitated. “Everything is fine now, Mom. Perfectly 
fine. But—” 

Before she could say another word, Noah burst into the room. 

“Hey, Carly Beth—” he called in a deep, raspy voice. “Look at me! How do 
I look in your mask?”

Judith Bellwood deliberately tripped me in math class. 

I saw her white sneaker shoot out into the aisle. Too late. 

I was carrying my notebook up to the chalkboard to put a problem on the 
board. My eyes were on the scrawls in my notebook. I’m not the neatest writer 
in the world. 

And before I could stop, I saw the white sneaker shoot out. I tripped over it 
and went sprawling to the floor, landing hard on my elbows and knees. Of course 
all the papers flew out of my notebook and scattered everywhere. 

And the whole class thought it was a riot. Everyone was laughing and 
cheering as I struggled to pull myself up. Judith and her pal, Anna Frost, laughed 
hardest of all. 

I landed on my funny bone, and the pain vibrated up and down my whole 
body. As I climbed to my feet and then bent to pick up my notebook papers, I 
knew my face was as red as a tomato. 

“Nice move, Sam!” Anna called, a big grin on her face. 

“Instant replay!” someone else shouted. 

I glanced up to see a triumphant glow in Judith’s green eyes. 

I’m the tallest girl in my seventh-grade class. No. Correct that. I’m the 
tallest kid in my seventh-grade class. I’m at least two inches taller than my 
friend, Cory Blinn, and he’s the tallest guy. 

I’m also the biggest klutz who ever stumbled over the face of the earth. I 
mean, just because I’m tall and slender doesn’t mean I have to be graceful. And 
believe me, I’m not. 

But why is it such a riot when I stumble over a wastebasket or drop my tray 
in the lunchroom or trip over someone’s foot in math class? 

Judith and Anna are just cruel, that’s all. 

I know they both call me “Stork” behind my back. Cory told me they do. 

And Judith is always making fun of my name, which is Byrd. Samantha 
Byrd. “Why don’t you fly away, Byrd!” That’s what she’s always saying to me. 
Then she and Anna laugh as if that’s the funniest joke they’ve ever heard. 

“Why don’t you fly away, Byrd!” 

Ha-ha. Big joke. 



Cory says that Judith is just jealous of me. But that’s stupid. I mean, why 
should Judith be jealous? She’s not nine feet tall. She’s about five-two, perfect 
for a twelve-year-old. She’s graceful. She’s athletic. And she’s really pretty, with 
pale, creamy skin, big green eyes, and wavy, copper-colored hair down to her 
shoulders. 

So what’s to be jealous about? 

I think Cory is just trying to make me feel better—and doing a lousy job of 
it. 

Anyway, I gathered all my papers together and shoved them back into the 
notebook. Sharon asked if I was okay. (Sharon is my teacher. We call all the 
teachers by their first names here at Montrose Middle School.) 

I muttered that I was fine, even though my elbow was throbbing like crazy. 
And I copied the problem onto the board. 

The chalk squeaked, and everyone groaned and complained. I can’t help it. 
I’ve never been able to write on the board without squeaking the chalk. 

It isn’t such a big deal —is it? 

I heard Judith whisper some crack about me to Anna, but I couldn’t hear 
what it was. I glanced up from the problem to see the two of them snickering and 
smirking at me. 

And wouldn’t you know it—I couldn’t solve the problem. I had something 
wrong with the equation, and I couldn’t figure out what. 

Sharon stepped up behind me, her skinny arms crossed over her ugly 
chartreuse sweater. She moved her lips as she read what I had written, trying to 
see where I had gone wrong. 

And of course Judith raised her hand and called out, “I see the problem, 
Sharon. Byrd can’t add. Four and two is six, not five.” 

I could feel myself blushing again. 

Where would I be without Judith to point out my mistakes to the whole 
class? 

Everyone was laughing again. Even Sharon thought it was funny. 

And I had to stand there and take it. Good old Samantha, the class klutz. 
The class idiot. 

My hand was shaking as I erased my stupid mistake and wrote in the right 
numbers. 

I was so angry. At Judith. And at myself. 

But I kept it together as I walked—carefully—back to my seat. I didn’t 



even glance at Judith as I walked past her. 

I kept it together until Home Ec. class that afternoon. 
Then it got ugly. 



2 


Daphne is our teacher in Home Ec. I like Daphne. She is a big, jolly woman with 
several chins and a great sense of humor. 

The rumor is that Daphne always makes us bake cakes and pies and 
brownies so that she can eat them all after we leave the class. 

That’s kind of mean, I think. But it’s probably a little bit true. 

We have Home Ec. right after lunch, so we’re never very hungry. Most of 
what we make wouldn’t make good dog food, anyway. So it mostly gets left in 
the Home Ec. room. 

I always look forward to the class. Partly because Daphne is a fun teacher. 
And partly because it’s the one class where there’s no homework. 

The only bad thing about Home Ec. class is that Judith is in it, too. 

Judith and I had a little run-in in the lunchroom. I sat down at the far end of 
the table, as far away from her as I could get. But I still heard her telling a couple 
of eighth-graders, “Byrd tried to fly in math class.” 

Everyone laughed and stared at me. 

“You tripped me, Judith!” I shouted angrily. My mouth was full of egg 
salad, which dribbled down my chin when I shouted. 

And everyone laughed at me again. 

Judith said something, which I couldn’t hear over all the noise in the 
lunchroom. She smirked at me and tossed her red hair behind her shoulders. 

I started to get up and go over to her. I don’t know what I was thinking of 
doing. But I was so angry, I wasn’t thinking too clearly. 

Luckily, Cory appeared across the table. He dropped his lunch down on the 
table, turned the chair around backwards the way he always does, and sat down. 

“What’s four plus two?” he teased. 

“Forty-two,” I replied, rolling my eyes. “Do you believe Judith?” I asked 
bitterly. 

“Of course I believe Judith,” he said, pulling open his brown lunchbag. 
“Judith is Judith.” 

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I snapped. 

He shrugged. A grin broke out across his face. “I don’t know.” 

Cory is kind of cute. He has dark brown eyes that sort of crinkle up in the 



comers, a nose that’s a little too long, and a funny, crooked smile. 

He has great hair, but he never brushes it. So he never takes off his cap. It’s 
an Orlando Magic cap, even though he doesn’t know or care about the team. He 
just likes the cap. 

He peeked into his lunchbag and made a face. 

“Again?” I asked, wiping egg salad off the front of my T-shirt with a 
napkin. 

“Yeah. Again,” he replied glumly. He pulled out the same lunch his father 
packed for him every single morning. A grilled cheese sandwich and an orange. 
“Yuck!” 

“Why does your dad give you grilled cheese every day?” I asked. “Didn’t 
you tell him it gets cold and slimy by lunchtime?” 

“I told him,” Cory groaned, picking up one half of the sandwich in one 
hand and examining it as if it were some sort of science lab specimen. “He said 
it’s good protein.” 

“How can it be good protein if you throw it in the trash every day?” I asked. 

Cory grinned his crooked grin. “I didn’t tell him that I throw it in the trash 
every day.” He shoved the rubbery sandwich back into the bag and started to 
peel the orange. 

“It’s a good thing you came by,” I said, swallowing the last bite of my egg 
salad sandwich. “I was about to get up and go murder Judith over there.” 

We both glanced down the table. Judith and the two eighth-graders had their 
chairs tilted back and were laughing about something. One of the eighth-graders 
had a magazine, People magazine, I think, and she was showing a picture in it to 
the others. 

“Don’t murder Judith,” Cory advised, still peeling the orange. “You’ll get 
into trouble.” 

I laughed, scornful laughter. “You kidding? I’d get an award.” 

“If you murder Judith, your basketball team will never win another game,” 
Cory said, concentrating on the orange. 

“Ooh, that’s cruel!” I exclaimed. I tossed my balled-up aluminum foil at 
him. It bounced off his chest and dropped to the floor. 

He was right, of course. Judith was the best player on our team, the 
Montrose Mustangs. She was the only good player. She could dribble really well 
without getting the ball tangled up in her legs. And she had a great shooting eye. 

I, of course, was the worst player on the team. 



I admit it. I’m a total klutz, as I’ve said, which doesn’t get you very far on 
the basketball court. 

I really hadn’t wanted to be on the Mustangs. I knew I’d stink. 

But Ellen insisted. Ellen is the girls’ basketball coach. Ellen insisted I be on 
the team. 

“Sam, you’re so tall!” she told me. “You’ve got to play basketball. You’re a 
natural!” 

Sure, I’m a natural. A natural klutz. 

I can’t shoot at all, not even foul shots. Especially not foul shots. 

And I can’t run without tripping over my own Reeboks. And my hands are 
small, even though the rest of me isn’t, so I’m not too good at passing or 
catching the ball. 

I think Ellen has learned her lesson: Tall ain’t all. 

But now she’s too embarrassed to take me off the team. And I keep at it. I 
work hard at practice. I mean, I keep thinking I’ll get better. I couldn’t get any 
worse. 

If only Judith wasn’t such a hotshot. 

And if only she was nicer to me. 

But, as Cory put it, “Judith is Judith.” She’s always yelling at me during 
practice, and making fun of me, and making me feel two feet tall (which I 
sometimes wish I were)! 

“Byrd, why don’t you give us a break and fly away!” 

If she says that one more time, I’ll punch out her lights. I really will. 

“What are you thinking about, Sam?” Cory’s voice broke into my bitter 
thoughts. 

“About Judith, of course,” I muttered. “Miss Perfect.” 

“Hey, stop,” he said, pulling apart the orange sections. “You have good 
qualities, too, you know.” 

“Oh, really?” I snapped. “What are my good qualities? That I’m tall?” 

“No.” He finally popped an orange section into his mouth. I never saw 
anyone take so long to eat an orange! “You’re also smart,” he said. “And you’re 
funny.” 

“Thanks a bunch,” I replied, frowning. 

“And you’re very generous,” he added. “You’re so generous, you’re going 
to give me that bag of potato chips, right?” He pounced on it before I could grab 
it away from him. 



I knew there was a reason for his compliments. 

I watched Cory stuff down my potato chips. He didn’t even offer me one. 

Then the bell rang, and I hurried to Home Ec. 

Where I totally lost it. 

What happened was this: We were making tapioca pudding. And it was 
really messy. 

We all had big orange mixing bowls, and the ingredients were spread out on 
the long table next to the stove. 

I was busily stirring mine. It was nice and gloppy, and it made this great 
glop glop sound as I stirred it with a long wooden spoon. 

My hands were sticky for some reason. I had probably spilled some of the 
pudding on them. So I stopped to wipe them on my apron. 

I was being pretty neat—for me. There were only a few yellow puddles of 
pudding on my table. Most of it was actually in the mixing bowl. 

I finished stirring and, when I looked up, there was Judith. 

I was a little surprised because she had been working on the other side of 
the room by the windows. We generally keep as far apart from each other as 
possible. 

Judith had this odd smile on her face. And as she approached me, she 
pretended to trip. 

I swear she only pretended to trip! 

And she spilled her whole mixing bowl of tapioca onto my shoes. 

My brand-new blue Doc Martens. 

“Oops!” she said. 

That’s all. Just “Oops.” 

I looked down at my brand-new shoes covered in gloppy yellow pudding. 

And that’s when I lost it. 

I uttered an angry roar and went for Judith’s throat. 

I didn’t plan it or anything. I think it was temporary insanity. 

I just reached out both hands and grabbed Judith by the throat, and began to 
strangle her. 

I mean, they were brand-new shoes ! 

Judith started struggling and tried to scream. She pulled my hair and tried to 
scratch me. 

But I held onto her throat and roared some more, like an angry tiger. 

And Daphne had to pull us apart. 



She pulled me away by the shoulders, then thrust her wide body between 
us, blocking our view of each other. 

I was panting loudly. My chest was heaving up and down. 

“Samantha! Samantha! What were you doing?” I think that’s what Daphne 
was screaming. 

I couldn’t really hear her. I had this roaring in my ears, loud as a waterfall. I 
think it was just my anger. 

Before I knew it, I had pushed myself away from the table and was running 
out of the room. I ran out into the empty hall—and stopped. 

I didn’t know what to do next. I was so angry. 

If I had three wishes, I told myself, I know what they would be: Destroy 
Judith! Destroy Judith! Destroy Judith! 

Little did I know that I would soon get my wish. 

All three of them.

Daphne made Judith and me shake hands and apologize to each other after she 
dragged me back into the classroom. I had to do it. It was either that or be tossed 
out of school. 

“It really was an accident,” Judith muttered under her breath. “What’s your 
problem, Byrd?” 

Not much of an apology, if you ask me. 

But I shook hands with her. I didn’t need my parents being called to school 
because their daughter had tried to strangle a classmate. 

And I showed up—reluctantly—for basketball practice after school. I knew 
if I didn’t show, Judith would tell everyone that she had scared me away. 

I showed up because I knew Judith didn’t want me to. Which I think is as 
good a reason as any. 

Also, I needed the exercise. I needed to run back and forth across the court 
a few hundred times to get the anger out. I needed to sweat out the frustration 
from not being able to finish strangling Judith. 

“Let’s do some fast laps,” Ellen suggested. 

Some of the other girls groaned, but I didn’t. I started running before Ellen 
even blew her whistle. 

We were all in shorts and sleeveless T-shirts. Ellen wore gray sweats that 
were baggy in all the wrong places. She had frizzy red hair, and she was so 
straight and skinny, she looked sort of like a kitchen match. 

Ellen wasn’t very athletic. She told us she coached girls’ basketball because 
they paid her extra, and she needed the money. 

After running our laps around the gym, practice went pretty much as usual. 

Judith and Anna passed the ball to each other a lot. And they both took a lot 
of shots—jump shots, lay-ups, even hook shots. 

The others tried to keep up with them. 

I tried not to be noticed. 

I was still simmering about the tapioca pudding disaster and wanted as little 
contact with Judith—or anyone —as possible. I mean, I was really feeling glum. 

And watching Judith sink a twenty-foot jumper, catch her own rebound, and 
scoop a perfect two-handed shovel pass to Anna wasn’t helping to cheer me up 



one bit. 

Of course, things got worse. 

Anna actually passed the ball to me. I muffed it. It bounced off my hands, 
hit me in the forehead, and rolled away. 

“Heads up, Byrd!” I heard Ellen cry. 

I kept running. I tried not to look upset that I had blown my first 
opportunity of the practice. 

A few minutes later, I saw the ball flying toward me again, and I heard 
Judith shout, “Get this one, Stork!” 

I was so startled that she had called me “Stork” to my face that I caught the 
ball. I started to dribble to the basket—and Anna reached a hand in and easily 
stole the ball. She spun around and sent an arching shot to the basket, which 
nearly went in. 

“Nice steal, Anna!” Ellen cried. 

Breathing hard, I turned angrily to Judith. “What did you call me?” 

Judith pretended she didn’t hear me. 

Ellen blew the whistle. “Fast breaks!” she shouted. 

We practiced fast breaks three at a time. Dribbling fast, we’d pass the ball 
back and forth. Then the one under the hoop with the ball was supposed to take 
the shot. 

I need to practice slow breaks! I thought to myself. 

I had no trouble keeping up with the others. I mean, I had the longest legs, 
after all. I could run fast enough. I just couldn’t do anything else while I was 
mnning. 

As Judith, Anna, and I came roaring down the court, I prayed I wouldn’t 
make a total fool of myself. Sweat poured down my forehead. My heart was 
racing. 

I took a short pass from Anna, dribbled under the basket, and took a shot. 
The ball flew straight up in the air, then bounced back to the floor. It didn’t even 
come close to the backboard. 

I could hear girls laughing on the sidelines. Judith and Anna had their usual 
superior smirks on their faces. “Good eye!” Judith called, and everyone laughed 
some more. 

After twenty minutes of fast-break torture, Ellen blew her whistle. 
“Scrimmage,” she called out. That was the signal for us to divide into two teams 
and play each other. 



I sighed, wiping perspiration off my forehead with the back of my hand. I 
tried to get into the game. I concentrated hard, mainly on not messing up. But I 
was pretty discouraged. 

Then, a few minutes into the game, Judith and I both dove for the ball at the 
same time. 

Somehow, as I dove, my arms outstretched, Judith’s knee came up hard— 
and plunged like a knife into my chest. 

The pain shot through my entire body. 

I tried to cry out. But I couldn’t make a sound. 

I uttered a weird, gasping noise, sort of like the honk of a sick seal—and 
realized I couldn’t breathe. 

Everything turned red. Bright, shimmering red. 

Then black. 

I knew I was going to die. 



4 


Having your breath knocked out has to be the worst feeling in the world. It’s just 
so scary. You try to breathe, and you can’t. And the pain just keeps swelling, like 
a balloon being blown up right inside your chest. 

I really thought I was dead meat. 

Of course I was perfectly okay a few minutes later. I still felt a little shaky, 
a little dizzy. But I was basically okay. 

Ellen insisted that one of the girls walk me to the locker room. Naturally, 
Judith volunteered. As we walked, she apologized. She said it had been an 
accident. Totally an accident. 

I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want her to apologize. I didn’t want to talk to 
her at all. I just wanted to strangle her again. 

This time for good. 

I mean, how much can one girl take in a day? Judith had tripped me in math 
class, dumped her disgusting tapioca pudding all over my new Doc Martens in 
Home Ec, and kicked me unconscious in basketball practice. 

Did I really have to smile and accept her apology now? 

No way! No way in a million years. 

I trudged silently to the locker room, my head bent, my eyes on the floor. 

When she saw that I wasn’t going to buy her cheap apology, Judith got 
angry. Do you believe that? She shoves her knee through my chest—then she 
gets angry! 

“Why don’t you just fly away, Byrd!” she muttered. Then she went trotting 
back to the gym floor. 

I got changed without showering. Then I collected my stuff, and slunk out 
of the building, and got my bike. 

That’s really the last straw, I thought, walking my bike across the parking 
lot in back of school. 

It was about half an hour later. The late afternoon sky was gray and 
overcast. I felt a few light drops of rain on my head. 

The last straw, I repeated to myself. 

I live two blocks from the school, but I didn’t feel like going home. I felt 
like riding and riding and riding. I felt like just going straight and never turning 



back. 

I was angry and upset and shaky. But mainly angry. 

Ignoring the raindrops, I climbed onto my bike and began pedaling in the 
direction away from my house. Front yards and houses went by in a whir. I 
didn’t see them. I didn’t see anything. 

I pedaled harder and harder. It felt so good to get away from school. To get 
away from Judith. 

The rain started to come down a little harder. I didn’t mind. I raised my face 
to the sky as I pedaled. The raindrops felt cold and refreshing on my hot skin. 

When I looked down, I saw that I had reached Jeffers’ Woods, a long stretch 
of trees that divides my neighborhood from the next. 

A narrow bike path twisted through the tall, old trees, which were winter 
bare and looked sort of sad and lonely without their leaves. Sometimes I took the 
path, seeing how fast I could ride over its curves and bumps. 

But the sky was darkening, the black clouds hovering lower. And I saw a 
glimmering streak of lightning in the sky over the trees. 

I decided I’d better turn around and ride home. 

But as I turned, someone stepped in front of me. 

A woman! 

I gasped, startled to see someone on this empty road by the woods. 

I squinted at her as the rain began to fall harder, pattering on the pavement 
around me. She wasn’t young, and she wasn’t old. She had dark eyes, like two 
black coals, on a pale, white face. Her thick, black hair flowed loosely behind 
her. 

Her clothing was sort of old-fashioned. She had a bright red, heavy woolen 
shawl pulled around her shoulders. She wore a long black skirt down to her 
ankles. 

Her dark eyes seemed to light up as she met my stare. 

She looked confused. 

I should have run. 

I should have pedaled away from her as fast as I could. 

If only I had known... 

But I didn’t flee. I didn’t escape. 

Instead, I smiled at her. “Can I help you?” I asked.

The woman’s eyes narrowed. I could see she was checking me out. 

I lowered my feet to the ground, balancing the bike between my legs. The 
rain pattered on the pavement, big cold drops. 

I suddenly remembered I had a hood on my windbreaker. So I reached up 
behind my head and slipped it over my hair. 

The sky darkened to an eerie olive color. The bare trees in the woods 
shivered in a swirling breeze. 

The woman took a few steps closer. She was so pale, I thought. Almost 
ghostlike, except for the deep, dark eyes that were staring so hard at me. 

“I—I seem to have lost my way,” she said. To my surprise, she had an old 
woman’s voice, sort of shaky and frail. 

I squinted at her from under my hood. The rain was matting her thick, black 
hair to her head. It was impossible to tell how old she was. She could have been 
twenty or sixty! 

“This is Montrose Avenue,” I told her, speaking loudly because of the 
drumming of the raindrops. “Actually, Montrose ends here. At the woods.” 

She nodded thoughtfully, pursing her pale lips. “I am trying to get to 
Madison,” she said. “I think I have completely lost my direction.” 

“You’re pretty far from Madison,” I said. “It’s way over there.” I pointed. 

She chewed at her lower lip. “I’m usually pretty good at directions,” she 
said fretfully in her shaky voice. She adjusted the heavy red shawl over her 
slender shoulders. 

“Madison is way over on the east side,” I said with a shiver. The rain was 
cold. I was eager to go home and get into some dry clothes. 

“Can you take me there?” the woman asked. She grabbed my wrist. 

I almost gasped out loud. Her hand was as cold as ice! 

“Can you take me there?” she repeated, bringing her face close to mine. “I 
would be ever so grateful.” 

She had taken her hand away. But I could still feel the icy grip on my wrist. 

Why didn’t I run away? 

Why didn’t I raise my feet to the pedals and ride out of there as fast as I 
could? 



“Sure. I’ll show you where it is,” I said. 

“Thank you, dear.” She smiled. She had a dimple in one cheek when she 
smiled. I realized she was kind of pretty, in an old-fashioned way. 

I climbed off my bike and, holding onto the handlebars, began to walk it. 
The woman stepped beside me, adjusting her shawl. She walked in the middle of 
the street, her eyes trained on me. 

The rain continued to come down. I saw another jagged bolt of lightning far 
away in the olive sky. The swirling wind made my windbreaker flap against my 
legs. 

“Am I going too fast?” I asked. 

“No, dear. I can keep up,” she replied with a smile. She had a small purple 
bag slung over her shoulder. She protected the bag by tucking it under her arm. 

She wore black boots under the long skirt. The boots, I saw, had tiny 
buttons running up the sides. The boots clicked on the wet pavement as we 
walked. 

“I am sorry to be so much trouble,” the woman said, again pursing her lips 
fretfully. 

“No trouble,” I replied. My good deed for the day, I thought, brushing a 
drop of rain off my nose. 

“I love the rain,” she said, raising her hands to it, letting the raindrops 
splash her open palms. “Without the rain, what would wash the evil away?” 

That’s a weird thing to say, I thought. I muttered a reply. I wondered what 
evil she was talking about. 

Her long, black hair was completely soaked, but she didn’t seem to mind. 
She walked quickly with long, steady strides, swinging one hand as she walked, 
protecting the purple bag under the other arm. 

A few blocks later, the handlebars slipped out of my hands. My bike 
toppled over, and the pedal scraped my knee as I tried to grab the bike before it 
fell. 

What a klutz! 

I pulled the bike up and began walking it again. My knee throbbed. I 
shivered. The wind blew the rain into my face. 

What am I doing out here? I asked myself. 

The woman kept walking quickly, a thoughtful expression on her face. “It’s 
quite a rain,” she said, gazing up at the dark clouds. “This is so nice of you, 
dear.” 



“It isn’t too far out of my way,” I said politely. Just eight or ten blocks! 

“I don’t know how I could have gone so far astray,” she said, shaking her 
head. “I was sure I was headed in the right direction. Then when I came to those 
woods...” 

“We’re almost there,” I said. 

“What is your name?” she asked suddenly. 

“Samantha,” I told her. “But everyone calls me Sam.” 

“My name is Clarissa,” she offered. “I’m the Crystal Woman.” 

I wasn’t sure I’d heard that last part correctly. I puzzled over it, then let it 
slip from my mind. 

It was late, I realized. Mom and Dad might already be home from work. 
Even if they weren’t, my brother, Ron, was probably home, wondering where I 
was. 

A station wagon rolled toward us, its headlights on. I shielded my eyes from 
the bright lights and nearly dropped my bike again. 

The woman was still walking in the center of the street. I moved toward the 
curb so she could move out of the station wagon’s path. But she didn’t seem to 
care about it. She kept walking straight, her expression not changing, even 
though the bright headlights were in her face. 

“Look out!” I cried. 

I don’t know if she heard me. 

The station wagon swerved to avoid her and honked its horn as it rolled by. 

She smiled warmly at me as we kept walking. “So good of you to care 
about a total stranger,” she said. 

The streetlights flashed on suddenly. They made the wet street glow. The 
bushes and hedges, the grass, the sidewalks—everything seemed to glow. It all 
looked unreal. 

“Here we are. This is Madison,” I said, pointing to the street sign. Finally! I 
thought. 

I just wanted to say good-bye to this strange woman and pedal home as fast 
as I could. 

Lightning flickered. Closer this time. 

What a dreary day, I thought with a sigh. 

Then I remembered Judith. 

The whole miserable day suddenly rolled through my mind again. I felt a 
wave of anger sweep over me. 



“Which way is east?” the woman asked, her shaky voice breaking into my 
bitter thoughts. 

“East?” I gazed both ways on Madison, trying to clear Judith from my 
mind. I pointed. 

The wind picked up suddenly, blowing a sheet of rain against me. I 
tightened my grip on the handlebars. 

“You are so kind,” the woman said, wrapping the shawl around her. Her 
dark eyes stared hard into mine. “So kind. Most young people aren’t kind like 
you.” 

“Thank you,” I replied awkwardly. The cold made me shiver again. 
“Well... good-bye.” I started to climb onto my bike. 

“No. Wait,” she pleaded. “I want to repay you.” 

“Huh?” I uttered. “No. Really. You don’t have to.” 

“I want to repay you,” the woman insisted. She grabbed my wrist again. 
And again I felt a shock of cold. 

“You’ve been so kind,” the woman repeated. “So kind to a total stranger.” 

I tried to free my wrist, but her grip was surprisingly tight. “You don’t have 
to thank me,” I said. 

“I want to repay you,” she replied, bringing her face close to mine, still 
holding onto my wrist. “Tell you what. I’ll grant you three wishes.” 



6 


She’s crazy, I realized. 

I stared into those coal black eyes. Rainwater trickled from her hair, down 
the sides of her pale face. I could feel the coldness of her hand, even through the 
sleeve of my windbreaker. 

The woman is crazy, I thought. 

I’ve been walking through the pouring rain for twenty minutes with a crazy 
person. 

“Three wishes,” the woman repeated, lowering her voice as if not wanting 
to be overheard by anyone. 

“No. Thanks. I’ve really got to get home,” I said. I tugged my wrist from 
her grasp and turned to my bike. 

“I’ll grant you three wishes,” the woman repeated. “Anything you wish 
shall come true.” She moved the purple bag in front of her and carefully pulled 
something from it. It was a glass ball, bright red, the size of a large grapefruit. It 
sparkled despite the darkness around us. 

“That’s nice of you,” I said, wiping water off the bike seat with my hand. 
“But I don’t really have any wishes right now.” 

“Please—let me repay you for your kindness,” the woman insisted. She 
raised the gleaming red ball in one hand. Her hand was small and as pale as her 
face, the fingers bony. “I really do want to repay you.” 

“My—uh—mom will be worried,” I said, glancing up and down the street. 

No one in sight. 

No one to protect me from this lunatic if she turned dangerous. 

Just how crazy was she? I wondered. Could she be dangerous? Was I 
making her angry by not playing along, by not making a wish? 

“It isn’t a joke,” the woman said, reading the doubt in my eyes. “Your 
wishes will come true. I promise you.” She narrowed her gaze. The red ball 
suddenly glowed brighter. “Make your first wish, Samantha.” 

I stared back at her, thinking hard. I was cold and wet and hungry—and a 
little frightened. I just wanted to get home and get dry. 

What if she won’t let me go? 

What if I can’t get rid of her? What if she follows me home? 



Again, I searched up and down the block. Most of the houses had lights on. 
I could probably run to the nearest one and get help if I needed it. 

But, I decided, it might be easier just to play along with the crazy woman 
and make a wish. 

Maybe that would satisfy her, and she’d go on her way and let me go home. 

“What is your wish, Samantha?” she demanded. Her black eyes glowed red, 
the same color as the gleaming ball in her hand. 

She suddenly looked very old. Ancient. Her skin was so pale and tight, I 
thought I could see her skull underneath. 

I froze. 

I couldn’t think of a wish. 

And then I blurted out, “My wish is... to be the strongest player on my 
basketball team!” 

I don’t know why I said that. I guess I was just nervous. And I had Judith 
on my mind and all that had happened that day, ending up with the disaster at 
basketball practice. 

And so that was my wish. Of course I immediately felt like a total jerk. I 
mean, of all the things to wish for in the world, why would anyone pick that? 

But the woman didn’t seem at all surprised. 

She nodded, closing her eyes for a moment. The red ball glowed brighter, 
brighter, until the fiery red radiated around me. Then it quickly faded. 

Clarissa thanked me again, turned, tucked the glass ball back in the purple 
bag, and began walking quickly away. 

I breathed a sigh of relief. I was so glad she was gone! 

I jumped on my bike, turned it around, and began pedaling furiously toward 
home. 

A perfect end to a perfect day, I thought bitterly. 

Trapped in the rain with a crazy woman. 

And the wish? 

I knew it was totally stupid. 

I knew I’d never have to think about it again. 



7 


I found myself thinking about the wish at dinner. 

I couldn’t get over the way the crystal ball had glowed that strange red 
color. 

Mom was trying to get me to take another helping of mashed potatoes, and 
I was refusing. They were the kind from a box—you know, potato flakes, or 
something—and didn’t taste at all like real mashed potatoes. 

“Sam, you’ve got to eat more if you want to grow big and strong,” Mom 
said, holding the potato serving bowl under my nose. 

“Mom, I don’t want to grow anymore!” I exclaimed. “I’m already taller 
than you are, and I’m only twelve!” 

“Please don’t shout,” Dad said, reaching for the string beans. Canned string 
beans. Mom gets home from work late and doesn’t have time to make any real 
food. 

“I was tall when I was twelve,” Mom said thoughtfully. She passed the 
potatoes to Dad. 

“And then you shrunk!” Ron exclaimed, snickering. My older brother 
thinks he’s a riot. 

“I just meant I was tall for my age,” Mom said. 

“Well, I’m too tall for my age,” I grumbled. “I’m too tall for any age!” 

“In a few years you won’t be saying that,” Mom told me. 

When she looked away, I reached under the table and fed some string beans 
to Punkin. Punkin is my dog, a little brown mutt. He’ll eat anything. 

“Are there more meatballs?” Dad asked. He knew there were. He just 
wanted Mom to get up and get them for him. 

Which she did. 

“How was basketball practice?” Dad asked me. 

I made a face and gave a double thumbs-down. 

“She’s too tall for basketball,” Ron mumbled with a mouth full of food. 

“Basketball takes stamina,” Dad said. Sometimes I can’t figure out why 
Dad says half the things he says. 

I mean, what am / supposed to say to that? 

I suddenly thought of the crazy woman and the wish I had made. “Hey, 



Ron, want to shoot a few baskets after dinner?” I asked, poking my string beans 
around on the plate with my fork. 

We have a hoop on the front of the garage and floodlights to light up the 
driveway. Ron and I play a little one-on-one sometimes after dinner. 

You know. To unwind before starting our homework. 

Ron glanced out of the dining room window. “Did it stop raining?” 

“Yeah. It stopped,” I told him. “About half an hour ago.” 

“It’ll still be real wet,” he said. 

“A few puddles won’t ruin your game,” I told him, laughing. 

Ron’s a really good basketball player. He’s a natural athlete. So of course he 
has almost no interest at all in playing with me. He’d rather stay up in his room 
reading a book. Any book. 

“I’ve got a lot of homework,” Ron said, pushing his black-framed glasses 
up on his nose. 

“Just a few minutes,” I pleaded. “Just a little shooting practice.” 

“Help your sister,” Dad urged. “You can give her some pointers.” 

Ron reluctantly agreed. “But only for a few minutes.” He glanced out the 
window again. “We’re going to get soaked.” 

“I’ll bring a towel,” I said, grinning. 

“Don’t let Punkin out,” Mom said. “He’ll get his paws all wet and track 
mud on the floor.” 

“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Ron grumbled. 

I knew it was stupid, but I had to see if my wish had come true. 

Would I suddenly be a great basketball player? 

Would I suddenly be able to outshoot Ron? To actually throw the basketball 
into the basket? 

Would I be able to dribble without stumbling? To pass the ball in the 
direction I wanted? To catch the ball without it bouncing off my chest? 

I kept scolding myself for even thinking about the wish. 

It was so dumb. So totally dumb. 

Just because a crazy woman offers to grant three wishes, I told myself, 
doesn’t mean that you have to get all excited and think you’re instantly going to 
turn into Michael Jordan! 

Still, I couldn’t wait to play with Ron. 

Was I in for a big surprise? 



8 


Yes. I was in for a surprise. 

My shooting was actually worse ! 

The first two times I tossed the ball at the hoop, I missed the garage entirely 
and had to go chase the ball over the wet grass. 

Ron laughed. “I see you’ve been practicing!” he teased. 

I gave him a hard shove in the stomach with the wet basketball. He 
deserved it. It wasn’t funny. 

I was so disappointed. 

I told myself over and over that wishes don’t come true, especially wishes 
granted by crazy women out wandering in the rain. 

But I couldn’t help but get my hopes up. 

I mean, Judith and Anna and the other girls on the team were so mean to 
me. It would be totally terrific to come to the game against Jefferson Elementary 
tomorrow and suddenly be the star of the team. 

The star. Ha-ha. 

Ron dribbled the ball to the hoop and made an easy lay-up. He caught his 
own rebound and passed the ball to me. 

It sailed through my hands and bounced down the driveway. I started 
running after it, slipped on the wet surface, and fell face down into a puddle. 

Some star. 

I’m playing worse ! I told myself. Much worse! 

He helped me up. I brushed myself off. 

“Remember, this was your idea!” he said. 

With a determined cry, I grabbed the ball, darted past him, and dribbled 
furiously to the basket. 

I had to make this basket. I had to! 

But as I went up for my shot, Ron caught up with me. He leapt high, raised 
his arms, and batted the ball away. 

“Aaaagggh!” 

I let out a frustrated shout. “I wish you were only a foot tall! ” I cried. 

He laughed and ran after the ball. 



But I felt a tremor of fear roll down my body. 

What have I just done? I asked myself, staring into the darkness of the back 
yard, waiting for Ron to return with the ball. Have I just made my second wish? 

I didn’t mean to! I told myself, my heart thudding wildly in my chest. It was 
an accident. It wasn’t a real wish. 

Have I just shrunk my brother down to a foot tall? 

No. No. No. I repeated over and over, waiting for him to reappear. 

The first wish hadn’t come true. There was no reason to expect the second 
wish to come true. 

I squinted into the heavy darkness of the back yard. “Ron—where are 
you?” 

Then I gasped as he came scampering toward me over the grass—a foot tall 
—just as I had wished! 



9 


I froze like a statue. I felt cold as stone. 

Then, as the tiny figure emerged from the darkness, I started to laugh. 

“Punkin!” I cried. “How did you get out?” 

I was so happy to see him—so happy it wasn’t a tiny Ron scampering over 
the grass—I picked up the little dog and hugged him tight. 

Of course his paws got me covered with wet mud. But I didn’t care. 

Sam, you’ve just got to chill, I scolded myself as Punkin struggled free. 
Your wish about Ron couldn’t come true because Clarissa isn’t here with her 
glowing red ball. 

You’ve got to stop thinking about the three wishes, I told myself. It’s just 
dumb. And you’re making yourself crazy over them. 

“What’s going on? How’d he get out?” Ron cried, appearing from the side 
of the garage with the ball. 

“Must’ve sneaked out,” I replied with a shrug. 

We played a few more minutes. But it was cold and wet. And no fun at all, 
especially for me. 

I didn’t sink a single basket. 

We finished with a foul shot competition, a short game of HORSE. Ron 
won easily. I was still on the O. 

As we trotted back to the house, Ron patted me on the back. “Ever think of 
taking up tiddly-winks?” he teased. “Or maybe Parcheesi?” 

I uttered an unhappy wail. I had the sudden urge to tell him why I felt so 
disappointed, to tell him about the weird woman and the three wishes. 

I hadn’t told Mom or Dad about her, either. The whole story was just too 
stupid. 

But I thought maybe my brother would find it funny. “I have to tell you 
about this afternoon,” I said as we pulled off our wet sneakers in the kitchen. 
“You won’t believe what happened to me. I—” 

“Later,” he said, pulling off his wet socks and tucking them into the 
sneakers. “I’ve got to get to that homework.” 

He disappeared up to his room. 

I started to my room, but the phone rang. I picked it up after the first ring. 



It was Cory, calling to ask how my basketball practice had gone after 
school. 

“Great,” I told him sarcastically. “Just great. I was so fabulous, they’re 
going to retire my number.” 

“You don’t have a number,” Cory reminded me. What a friend. 

Judith tried to trip me in the lunchroom the next afternoon. But this time I 
managed to step over her outstretched sneaker. 

I made my way past Judith’s table and found Cory nearly hidden in the 
corner near the trash baskets. He had already unwrapped his lunch and had a 
very unhappy expression on his face. 

“Not grilled cheese again!” I exclaimed, dropping my brown paper 
lunchbag on the table and pulling out the chair across from him. 

“Grilled cheese again,” he muttered. “And look at it. I don’t even think it’s 
American cheese. I think my dad tried to slip in cheddar on me.” 

I opened my chocolate-milk carton, then pulled my chair in closer. Across 
the room, some boys were laughing loudly, tossing a pink-haired Troll doll back 
and forth. It landed in someone’s soup, and the table erupted in wild cheers. 

As I picked up my sandwich, a shadow fell over the table. I realized that 
someone was standing behind me. 

“Judith!” I cried, turning my head. 

She sneered down at me. She was wearing a green-and-white school 
sweater over dark green corduroys. “Are you coming to the game after school, 
Byrd?” she demanded coldly. 

I set down the sandwich. “Yeah. Of course I’m coming,” I replied, puzzled 
by the question. 

“Too bad,” she replied, frowning. “That means we don’t have a chance of 
winning.” 

Judith’s pal, Anna, suddenly appeared beside her. “Couldn’t you get sick or 
something?” she asked me. 

“Hey, give Sam a break!” Cory cried angrily. 

“We really want to beat Jefferson,” Anna said, ignoring him. She had dark 
red lipstick smeared on her chin. Anna wore more lipstick than all the other 
seventh-graders put together. 

“I’ll try my best,” I replied through clenched teeth. 

They both laughed as if I had made a joke. Then they walked off, shaking 



their heads. 

If only my stupid wish would come true! I thought bitterly. 

But of course I knew that it wouldn’t. 

I figured I was in for more embarrassment and humiliation at the game. 
I had no idea just how surprising the game would turn out to be. 



10 


The game felt weird from the beginning. 

The Jefferson team was mostly sixth-graders, and they were pretty small. 
But they were well-coached. They really seemed to know where they were 
going. And they had a lot of energy and team spirit. 

As they came trotting to the center of the gym for the opening tip-off, my 
stomach was fluttery and I felt as if I weighed a thousand pounds. 

I was really dreading this game. I knew I was going to mess up. And I knew 
that Judith and Anna would be sure to let me know just how badly I messed up, 
and how I let the team down. 

So I was really shaky as the game started. And when, in the opening tip-off, 
the ball was slapped right to me, I grabbed it—and started dribbling toward the 
wrong basket! 

Luckily, Anna grabbed me and turned me around before I could shoot a 
basket for Jefferson! But I could hear players on both teams laughing. 

And I glanced at the sidelines and saw that both coaches—Ellen and the 
Jefferson coach—were laughing, too. 

I could feel my face turn beet-red. I wanted to quit right then and go sink 
into a hole in the ground and never come out. 

But—to my amazement—I still had the ball. 

I tried to pass it to Judith. But I threw it too low, and a Jefferson girl stole it 
and started dribbling to our basket. 

The game was ten seconds old, and I’d already made two mistakes! 

I kept telling myself it was just a game, but it didn’t really help. Every time 
I heard someone laugh I knew they were laughing at me, at how I’d started the 
game by running in the wrong direction. 

When I looked up at the score for the first time, it was six to nothing, 
Jefferson. 

The ball suddenly came sailing to me, seemingly from out of nowhere. I 
grabbed for it, but it slipped out of my hands. One of my teammates took it, 
dribbled, then passed it back to me. 

I took my first shot. It hit the backboard—a triumph for me!—but didn’t 
come near the basket. Jefferson took the rebound. A few seconds later, it was 



eight to nothing. 

I’m playing worse than ever! I moaned to myself. I could see Judith glaring 
angrily at me from across the floor. 

I backed up, staying in the corner, away from the basket. I decided to try 
and keep out of the action as much as possible. Maybe that way I wouldn’t 
embarrass myself quite so much. 

After about five minutes into the first quarter, things started to get weird. 

The score was twelve to two, Jefferson. 

Judith threw the ball inbounds. She meant to throw it to Anna. But Judith’s 
toss was weak, and the ball bounced to a short, blonde-haired Jefferson player. 

I saw Judith yawn as she ran after the girl. 

A few seconds later, the ball was loose, bouncing near the center of the 
court. Anna made a weak grab for it. But she seemed to be moving in slow 
motion, and the blonde Jefferson player snatched it from her hands. 

Anna stood watching her, breathing hard, perspiration running down her 
forehead. I had to stop and stare. Anna looked exhausted —and we’d only been 
playing five minutes! 

The Jefferson team dribbled all the way across the floor, passing the ball 
from girl to girl, as our players stood and watched. 

“Let’s go, Mustangs!” Judith cried, trying to rouse everyone. But I saw her 
yawn again as she walked to the sidelines to throw in the ball. 

“Come on, girls! Hustle! Hustle!” Ellen was shouting from the sidelines, 
her hands cupped around her mouth. “Run, Judith—don’t walk! Let’s look 
alive!” 

Judith sent another feeble throw onto the floor. It bounced away from a 
Jefferson player. I scooped it up and started to dribble it, running full speed. 

Just outside the key, I stopped, turned, and looked for someone to pass it to. 

But to my surprise, my teammates were still far behind me, walking slowly, 
exhaustedly, in my direction. 

As the Jefferson players swarmed around me, trying to take the ball away, I 
took a shot. It hit the rim of the basket—and bounced right back into my hands. 

So I took another shot. And missed again. 

Judith raised her hands slowly to catch the rebound. But the ball bounced 
right through her hands. She frowned in surprise, but didn’t make a move to go 
after it. 

I grabbed the ball, dribbled twice, nearly tripped over it—and shot. 



To my amazement, the ball bounced on top of the hoop, landed on the rim, 
and then dropped through. 

“Way to go, Sam!” I heard Ellen shout from the sidelines. 

My teammates uttered weak cheers. I watched them go after the Jefferson 
players, yawning and moving in slow motion, as if in some kind of trance. 

“Pick it up! Pick it up!” Ellen was shouting encouragement. 

But her words didn’t seem to help. 

Judith tripped and fell to her knees. As I stared in bewilderment, she didn’t 
get up. 

Anna was yawning loudly, walking toward the ball, not running. 

My two other Mustang teammates also seemed to be wandering hazily in 
slow motion, making lame attempts to defend our basket. 

Jefferson scored easily. 

Judith was still on her knees, her eyes half shut. 

What on earth is happening? I wondered. 

A long, shrill whistle broke into my thoughts. It took me a while to realize 
that Ellen had called time out. 

“Mustangs—hustle up! Hustle up!” she shouted, motioning for us to cluster 
around her. 

I quickly trotted over to Ellen. Turning back, I saw Judith, Anna, and the 
others trudging over slowly, yawning, pulling their bodies with great effort. 

And as Ellen shouted for everyone to “hustle up,” I watched them wearily 
approach. Then I realized to my amazement that my wish had come true ! 



11 


“What is the matter, girls?” Ellen demanded as we huddled on the sidelines. She 
glanced from player to player, examining each one with concern. 

Anna dropped down wearily to the floor, her shoulders slumped. It looked 
like she could barely keep her eyes open. 

Judith leaned her back against the gym’s tile wall. She was breathing hard, 
and beads of sweat rolled down her pale forehead. 

“Let’s get up some energy,” Ellen urged, clapping her hands. “I thought you 
girls were pumped for this game!” 

“There’s no air in here,” one of the players complained. 

“I feel so tired,” another one said, yawning. 

“Maybe we’re coming down with something,” Anna suggested from down 
on the floor. 

“Do you feel sick, too?” Ellen asked me. 

“No,” I told her. “I feel okay.” 

Behind me, Judith groaned wearily and tried to push herself away from the 

wall. 

The referee, a high school kid wearing a black-and-white-striped shirt about 
five sizes too big for him, blew his whistle. He signaled for us to get back out on 
the floor. 

“I don’t understand it,” Ellen sighed, shaking her head. She helped pull 
Anna to her feet. “I don’t understand it. I really don’t.” 

I understood it. 

I understood it perfectly. 

My wish had come true. I couldn’t believe it! That strange woman really 
did have some kind of magical powers. And she had granted my wish. 

Only not quite the way I had imagined. 

I remembered my words so clearly. I had wished to be the strongest player 
on the basketball team. That meant I wanted the woman to make me a stronger, 
better player. 

Instead, she had made everyone else weaker! 

I was the same klutzy player I’d always been. I still couldn’t dribble, pass, 
or shoot. 



But I was the strongest player on the team ! 

How could I have been such a jerk? I scolded myself angrily as I trotted 
back to the center of the gym floor. Wishes never turn out the way you want 
them to. 

When I reached center court, I turned back and saw Judith, Anna, and the 
others trudging onto the floor. Their shoulders were slumped, and they dragged 
their sneakers over the floor as they walked. 

I have to admit I enjoyed it just a little. 

I mean, I felt perfectly fine. And they looked so weak and pitiful. 

Judith and Anna really deserve it, I told myself. I tried not to grin as they 
slumped into their places. But maybe I was smiling just a little. 

The referee blew his whistle and called for a jump ball to start things off. 
Judith and a Jefferson player faced each other at the center circle. 

The referee tossed the ball up. The Jefferson girl jumped high. Judith made 
a real effort. I could see the strain on her face. 

But her feet didn’t even leave the floor. 

The Jefferson player batted the ball to one of her teammates, and they 
headed down the floor with it. 

I chased after them, running at full speed. But the rest of my team could 
only walk. 

Jefferson scored with an easy lay-up. 

“Come on, Judith—we can catch them!” I shouted, clapping my hands 
cheerfully. 

Judith glared dully at me. Her green eyes looked faded, kind of washed out. 

“Pick it up! Pick it up! Let’s go, Mustangs!” I cheered energetically. 

I was really enjoying rubbing it in. 

Judith could barely bounce the ball inbounds. I picked it up and dribbled all 
the way down the floor. Under the basket, one of the Jefferson players bumped 
me from behind as I tried to shoot. 

Two foul shots for me. 

It took my slow-motion teammates forever to make their way down the 
floor to line up. 

Of course, I missed both of my foul shots. 

But I didn’t care. 

“Let’s go, Mustangs!” I shouted, clapping my hands energetically. 
“Defense! Defense!” 



Suddenly I had become both a player and a cheerleader. I was really 
enjoying being the best player on the team. 

Watching Judith and Anna droop around and drag their bodies back and 
forth like tired losers was the biggest hoot! It was just awesome! 

We lost the game by twenty-four points. 

Judith, Anna, and the others looked glad it was over. I started to trot to the 
locker room to get changed, a big smile on my face. 

I was nearly changed by the time my teammates dragged into the locker 
room. Judith walked up to me and leaned against my locker. She eyed me 
suspiciously. 

“How come you ’re so peppy?” she demanded. 

I shrugged. “I don’t know,” I told her. “I feel okay. Same as ever.” 

Sweat was pouring down Judith’s forehead. Her red hair was matted wetly 
against her head. 

“What’s going on here, Byrd?” she demanded, yawning. “I don’t get it.” 

“Maybe you’re coming down with the flu or something,” I said, trying to 
hide how much I was enjoying this. 

This was great ! 

“Ohhh, I’m so tired,” Anna moaned, coming up behind Judith. 

“I’m sure you’ll both feel better tomorrow,” I chirped. 

“There’s something weird going on here,” Judith murmured weakly. She 
tried to stare hard at me, but her eyes were too tired to focus. 

“See you tomorrow!” I said brightly, picking up my stuff and heading out. 
“Feel better, guys!” 

I stopped outside the locker room door. 

They will feel better tomorrow, I assured myself. They’ll be back to normal 
tomorrow. 

They won’t stay like this—right? 

Right?? 


The next day, the bad news hit me like a ton of bricks. 



12 


Judith and Anna weren’t in school the next morning. 

I stared at their empty seats as I made my way to my seat in the front row. I 
kept turning back, searching for them. But the bell rang, and they weren’t there. 

Absent. Both absent. 

I wondered if the other girls on the team were absent, too. 

I felt a cold shiver run down my back. 

Were they still weak and tired? Too weak and tired to come to school? 

I had a frightening thought: What if they never returned to normal? What if 
the magic never wore off? 

Then I had an even more frightening thought: What if Judith and Anna and 
the others got weaker and weaker? What if they kept getting weaker until they 
died —and it was all my fault? 

All my fault. All my fault. 

I felt cold all over. My stomach felt as if I’d swallowed a rock. I had never 
felt so guilty, so horribly guilty, in all my life. 

I tried to force these thoughts from my mind, but I couldn’t. 

I couldn’t stop thinking that they might die because of my careless wish. 

I’ll be a murderer, I told myself with a shudder. A murderer. 

Sharon, our teacher, was standing right in front of me, talking about 
something. I couldn’t hear a word she said. I kept turning in my seat, staring 
back at the two empty chairs. 

Judith and Anna. What have I done to you ? 

At lunch, I told the whole story to Cory. 

Of course he just laughed at me. He had a mouthful of grilled cheese and 
nearly choked. 

“Do you believe in the Easter Bunny, too?” he asked. 

But I was in no mood for jokes. I was really upset. I stared down at my 
uneaten lunch, and felt sick. 

“Please take me seriously, Cory,” I begged. “I know it sounds dumb—” 

“You mean you’re for real?” he asked, his eyes studying my face. “I 



thought you were kidding, Sam. I thought this was a story for creative writing or 
something.” 

I shook my head. “Listen, Cory—if you had been at the girls’ basketball 
game yesterday afternoon, you’d know I’m not kidding,” I said, leaning across 
the table and whispering. “They were dragging around as if they were 
sleepwalking,” I told him. “It was so eerie!” 

I was so upset, my shoulders started to shake. I covered my eyes to keep 
myself from crying. 

“Okay... let’s think about this,” Cory said softly, his funny, crooked smile 
fading to a thoughtful frown. Finally, he had decided to take me seriously. 

“I’ve been thinking and thinking about it all morning,” I told him, still 
trying to force back the tears. “What if I’m a murderer, Cory? What if they really 
die?” 

“Sam, please,” he said, still frowning, his dark brown eyes studying mine. 
“Judith and Anna are probably not even sick. You’re probably making this all up 
in your mind. They’re probably perfectly okay.” 

“No way,” I muttered glumly. 

“Oh. I know!” Cory’s face brightened. “We can ask Audrey.” 

“Audrey?” Audrey was the school nurse. It took me a while to figure out 
what Cory was thinking. But I finally did. 

He was right. When you were going to be absent, your parents had to call 
Audrey in the morning and tell her why. Most likely, Audrey would be able to 
tell us why Judith and Anna were not in school today. 

I jumped up, nearly knocking my chair over. “Great idea, Cory!” I 
exclaimed. I started running through the lunchroom toward the door. 

“Wait! I’ll come with you!” Cory called, hurrying to catch up. 

Our sneakers pounded against the hard floor as we made our way down the 
long hall to the nurse’s office. We found Audrey locking the door. 

She is a short, sort of chunky woman, about forty or so, I guess, with 
bleached-blonde hair pinned up in a bun on top of her head. She always wears 
baggy jeans and shaggy sweaters, never a nurse’s uniform. 

“Lunchtime,” she said, seeing us stop beside her. “What do they have 
today? I’m starving.” 

“Audrey, can you tell us why Judith and Anna aren’t in school today?” I 
demanded breathlessly, ignoring her question. 

“Huh?” I was talking so fast, so excitedly, I don’t think she understood me. 



“Judith Bellwood and Anna Frost?” I repeated, my heart pounding. “Why 
aren’t they in school today?” 

I saw surprise in Audrey’s pale gray eyes. Then she lowered her gaze. 
“Judith and Anna, they’re gone,” she said sadly. 



13 


I stared at her. My mouth dropped open in horror. “They’re gone?” 

“They’re gone for at least a week,” Audrey said. She bent to lock the office 

door. 

“They—what?” I squeaked. 

She had trouble pulling the key from the lock. “They went to the doctor,” 
she repeated. “Their moms called this morning. They’re very sick. Both girls 
have the flu or something. They felt weak. Too weak to come to school.” 

I breathed a sigh of relief. I was glad Audrey had been concentrating on the 
door lock, so she hadn’t seen the horrified look on my face. 

Audrey hurried off down the hall. As soon as she was out of sight, I 
slumped against the wall. “At least they’re not dead,” I moaned. “She scared me 
to death!” 

Cory shook his head. “Audrey scared me, too,” he confessed. “See? Judith 
and Anna just have the flu. I’m sure the doctors—” 

“They don’t have the flu,” I insisted. “They’re weak because of my wish.” 

“Call them later,” he suggested. “You’ll see. They’ll probably be much 
better.” 

“I can’t wait till later,” I said in a trembling voice. “I have to do something, 
Cory. I have to do something to keep them from getting weaker and weaker until 
they shrivel up and die! ” 

“Calm down, Sam—” 

I started pacing back and forth in front of him. Some kids came hurrying by, 
on their way to their lockers. Someone called to me, but I didn’t reply. 

“We’ve got to get to class,” Cory said. “I think you’re getting all weird over 
nothing, Sam. If you wait till tomorrow—” 

“She said I had three wishes!” I exclaimed, not hearing a word Cory was 
saying. “I only used one.” 

“Sam—” Cory shook his head disapprovingly. 

“I’ve got to find her!” I decided. “I’ve got to find that strange woman. 
Don’t you see? I can wish to have the first wish undone. She said I get three 
wishes. So my second wish can be to erase the first!” 

This idea was starting to make me feel a lot better. 



But then Cory brought me back down into my gloom with one question: 
“How are you going to find her, Sam?” 



14 


I thought about Cory’s question all afternoon. I barely heard a word anyone said 
to me. 

We had a vocab test near the end of the day. I stared at the words as if they 
were in Martian! 

After a while, I heard Lisa, my teacher, calling my name. She was standing 
right in front of me, but I don’t think I heard her until her fifth or sixth try. 

“Are you okay, Samantha?” she asked, leaning over me. I knew she was 
wondering why I hadn’t started my test. 

“I feel a little sick,” I replied quietly. “I’ll be okay.” 

I’ll be okay as soon as I find that weird woman and get her to erase her 
spell! 

But where will I find her? I wondered. Where? 

After school, I reported to the gym for basketball practice. Everyone on my 
team was absent, so practice was canceled. 

Absent because of me .... 

I trudged upstairs to my locker and retrieved my down jacket. As I slammed 
the door and locked it, I had an idea. 

The woods. Jeffers’ Woods. 

That’s where I found Clarissa. 

I’ll bet I can find her there again. 

Maybe it’s her secret meeting place, I thought. 

Maybe she’ll be waiting for me there. 

Of course, she will! I told myself, giving myself a pep talk. Why did it take 
me so long to think of this? It made perfect sense. 

Humming to myself, I started jogging to the door. The hallway was nearly 
empty. 

I stopped when I saw a familiar figure in the doorway. “Mom!” 

“Hi, Sam.” She waved to me, even though I was standing right in front of 
her. She had a red-and-white wool cap pulled over her short blonde hair, and was 
wearing the tattered red ski jacket she always wears. 

She hadn’t been skiing in years. But she liked dressing like a ski bum. 



“Mom—what are you doing here?” I cried, not meaning it to sound as 
unfriendly as it did. I was eager to get to my bike and ride to Jeffers’ Woods. I 
didn’t need her here! 

“You didn’t forget about your appointment with Dr. Stone?” she asked, 
waving her car keys in her hand. 

“The orthodontist? Today?” I cried. “I can’tl” 

“You have to,” she replied sternly, tugging the arm of my jacket. “You 
know how hard it is to get in to see Dr. Stone.” 

“But I don’t want braces!” I cried, realizing I was sounding a little shrill, a 
little babyish. 

“Maybe you won’t need them,” Mom said, pulling me to the door. “Maybe 
you can get by with just a retainer. We’ll do whatever Dr. Stone says.” 

“But, Mom—I—I—” I searched my mind desperately for an excuse. “I 
can’t go with you. I have my bike here!” I cried desperately. 

“Go get it. We’ll put it in the trunk,” she replied without blinking. 

I had no choice. I had to go with her. Sighing loudly, I pushed open the door 
and hurried past her toward the bike racks. 

I found out I’m going to be wearing braces for at least the next six months. I had 
another appointment with Dr. Stone to have them put on the next week. 

I suppose I should have been upset about it. But it was hard to think about 
braces with Judith, Anna, and the other girls on my mind. 

I kept picturing them wasting away, getting thinner and thinner, weaker and 
weaker. I kept seeing this terrifying image in my mind. I was in the gym, 
dribbling the ball back and forth, faster and faster. And Judith, Anna, and the 
others were lying flat on their backs on the bleachers, trying to watch, but too 
weak to hold their heads up. 

That night after dinner, I was feeling so guilty, I called Judith to see how 
she was feeling. I think it was the first time in my life I had ever called her. 

Mrs. Bellwood answered. She sounded tired and tense. “Who is this?” she 
asked. 

I had a sudden impulse to hang up. But I told her, “It’s Samantha Byrd. I’m 
a friend from school.” 

Some friend. 

“I don’t think Judith can come to the phone,” she replied. “She’s just so 
weak.” 



“Did the doctor say what—?” I started. 

“I’ll ask Judith if she wants to talk,” Mrs. Bellwood interrupted. I could 
hear Judith’s little brother shouting something in the background. And I could 
hear cartoon music from their TV. “Don’t stay on too long,” she instructed. 
“Hello?” Judith answered in a faint, little-girl voice. 

“Oh. Hi, Judith. It’s me. Sam,” I said, trying not to sound nervous. 

“Sam?” Again the faint voice, nearly a whisper. 

“Sam Byrd,” I stammered. “I—I just wondered how you were feeling?” 
“Sam, did you cast a spell on us?” Judith asked. 

I gasped. How did she know? 



15 


“Judith—what do you mean?” I sputtered. 

“All the girls are sick except for you,” Judith replied. “Anna is sick. And so 
is Arlene. And Krista.” 

“Yes, but that doesn’t mean—” I started. 

“So I think you cast a spell on us,” Judith interrupted. 

Was she joking? I couldn’t tell. 

“I just hope you feel better,” I mumbled awkwardly. I could hear Mrs. 
Bellwood in the background telling Judith she should get off the phone. 

So I said good-bye and hung up. I was grateful it was a short conversation. 
But I couldn’t decide if Judith was kidding or not about my casting a spell. 

Her voice was really weak. She sounded so weary and lifeless. 

I felt angry that she had accused me, joke or no joke. That was so typical of 
Judith. Finding a way to make me angry even when I was calling to be nice. 

But I also felt guilty. Whether Judith had guessed it or not, I had cast a spell 
on her and the others. 

And now I had to find a way to have the spell removed. 

The next morning, two seats in my class were empty again. Judith and Anna 
were both absent. 

At lunch, I asked Cory if he wanted to come with me after school to go 
searching for the strange woman. 

“No way!” he cried, shaking his head. “She’ll probably turn me into a frog 
or something!” 

“Cory—can’t you take this seriously?” I screamed. Several kids turned to 

look. 

“Give me a break,” Cory muttered, blushing under his Orlando Magic cap. 
“Okay, I’m sorry,” I told him. “I’m really stressed out—you know?” 

He still refused to keep me company. He made up a lame excuse about 
having to help his mother clean the basement. 

Who cleans the basement in the middle of winter? 

Cory pretended he didn’t believe my story about the woman and the three 
wishes. But I had the feeling that maybe he was a little afraid. 



I was afraid, too. Afraid I wouldn’t find her. 

After school, I jumped on my bike and began pedaling toward Jeffers’ 
Woods. 

It was a gray, blustery day. Enormous, dark clouds rolled rapidly over the 
sky, threatening rain, maybe snow. 

It’s a lot like the day I ran into Clarissa, I thought. For some reason, that 
fact encouraged me. 

Some kids in my class waved to me and called out. But I rode past them, 
leaning over the handlebars, shifting gears to pick up speed. 

A few minutes later, Montrose Avenue curved away from the houses that 
lined both sides, and the bare trees of the woods came into view. 

The tall trees formed a dark wall, darker than the charcoal sky above. 

“She’s got to be here, got to be here,” I repeated in rhythm with my 
pedaling feet. 

Got to be here, got to be here. 

My heart nearly leapt out of my chest when I saw her, huddled low at the 
edge of the road. 

Waiting for me. 

“Hi!” I called out. “Hi! It’s me!” 

Why didn’t she answer? 



16 


As I pedaled closer, my heart pounding happily, I saw that she had her back 
turned to me. 

She had changed her outfit. She was wearing a purple wool beret, and a 
long black coat down nearly to her ankles. 

I screeched my bike to a halt a few feet behind her, my tires skidding over 
the pebbly road. “I need to make another wish!” I called breathlessly. 

She turned, and I gasped. 

I stared into a face full of freckles, a young-looking face framed by short, 
curly blonde hair. 

“I’m sorry. What did you say?” she asked, narrowing her eyes at me, her 
expression bewildered. 

“I—I’m sorry,” I stammered, feeling my face turn hot. “I—I thought you 
were someone else.” 

It was a different woman. 

I felt so embarrassed, I just wanted to die! 

Behind her, I saw two blonde-haired kids tossing a Frisbee back and forth at 
the edge of the woods. “Tommy—don’t throw it so hard. Your sister can’t catch 
it!” the woman instructed. 

Then she turned back to me. “What did you say about wishes? Are you 
lost?” she asked, studying my face with concern. 

I knew I was still blushing, but I couldn’t help it. “No. I thought you were 
—” I started. 

“Tommy—go chase it yourself!” she shouted to her little boy. The two kids 
started squabbling. She hurried over to settle it. 

“Sorry I bothered you,” I called. “Bye.” I turned my bike around and started 
pedaling rapidly toward home. 

I was embarrassed that I’d said such a stupid thing to a total stranger. But 
mainly I was disappointed. 

I really had expected the strange woman to be there. 

Where else could she be? I asked myself. 

I remembered that I had shown her the way to Madison Road. Maybe, I 
decided, I will get lucky and run into her there. 



It was a real long shot. But I was desperate. 

I turned my bike around and made my way to Madison. The wind had 
picked up, and my face began to feel cold and raw. I was riding against the wind, 
and the sharp cold was making my eyes water. 

Even through the blur, I could see that the woman was not hanging around 
on Madison, waiting for me to show up. 

Two mangy brown mutts trotted side by side across the street, their heads 
bowed against the wind. They were the only living creatures I saw. 

I rode slowly back and forth a few times, my eyes searching the rambling 
old houses of the neighborhood. 

A total waste of time. 

I was completely frozen. My ears and nose tingled with numbness. My 
watering eyes sent cold tears rolling down my cheeks. 

“Give up, Sam,” I instmcted myself aloud. 

The sky darkened. The storm clouds hovered low above the shivering trees. 

Feeling miserable and defeated, I turned and headed for home. I was 
pedaling furiously down the center of the street, trying to keep my bike upright 
in the gusting wind. 

I stopped when Judith’s house came into view. It was a long, low, redwood 
ranch-style house, set back from the street on a wide, sloping front lawn. 

Maybe I’ll stop for a minute and see how Judith is doing, I decided. 

It’ll give me a chance to get warm, too, I thought. I reached up a hand and 
felt my nose. Totally numb. 

Shivering, I rode up the driveway and lowered my bike to the ground. Then, 
trying to rub some feeling into my poor nose, I jogged up the walk and rang the 
bell. 

Mrs. Bellwood seemed very surprised to see a visitor. I told her who I was 
and that I just happened to be riding by. “How is Judith feeling?” I asked, 
shivering. 

“About the same,” she replied with a worried sigh. She had Judith’s green 
eyes, but her hair was nearly entirely gray. 

She led me into the hallway, which felt toasty and warm. The house smelled 
of roasting chicken. I suddenly realized I was hungry. 

“Judith! You have a visitor!” Mrs. Bellwood shouted up the stairs. 

I heard a weak reply, but couldn’t make out the words. 

“Go on up,” Judith’s mother said, putting a hand on the shoulder of my 



coat. “You look so cold,” she added, shaking her head. “Be careful, dear. You 
don’t want to get sick, too.” 

I climbed the stairs and found Judith’s room at the end of the hall. I 
hesitated at the doorway and peered in. 

The room was dimly lit. I could see Judith lying in bed, on top of the quilt, 
her head propped up on several pillows. Books and magazines and a couple of 
school notebooks were scattered over the bed. But Judith wasn’t reading. She 
was just staring straight ahead. 

“Stork?” she cried, seeing me in the doorway. 

I entered the room, forcing a smile to my face. “How are you feeling?” I 
asked softly. 

“What are you doing here?” she asked coldly. Her voice was hoarse. 

“I—I was riding my bike, and—” I stammered, staying by the door. I was 
startled by her anger. 

“Riding your bike? In this cold?” With great effort, she pulled herself up to 
a sitting position. Leaning against the headboard, she glared at me suspiciously. 

“I just wondered how you were,” I muttered. 

“Why don’t you just fly away, Byrd!” she growled nastily. 

“Huh?” 

“You are a witch—aren’t you!” she accused. 

I couldn’t believe she was saying these things. I was stunned. Shocked! It 
was no joke. I could see clearly that she was serious! 

“You did cast a spell on us. I know it!” 

“Judith—please,” I cried. “What are you saying ?” 

“We did a unit on witches in social studies last year,” she said in her hoarse 
voice. “We studied spells and things.” 

“That’s crazy!” I insisted. 

“You were jealous of me, Sam. Of me and Anna and everyone else,” Judith 
accused. 

“So?” I cried angrily. 

“So, all of a sudden all the girls on the team feel weak and sick. Except for 
you, Sam. You feel fine—right?” 

“Judith, listen to me—” I pleaded. 

“You’re a witch, Sam!” she screamed, her weak voice breaking. She started 
to cough. 

“Judith, you’re talking like a crazy person,” I insisted. “I’m not a witch. 



How could I be a witch? I’m sorry you’re sick. Really, I am. But—” 

“You’re a witch! You’re a witch!” Judith chanted, her voice a shrill whisper. 
“I’ve talked to all the girls. They all agree. You’re a witch. A witch!” 

I was so furious, I thought I’d explode. I had my hands balled into tight 
fists. My head was throbbing. 

Judith had been talking to all the other girls, spreading this story that I was 
a witch. How could she do such a crazy thing? 

“A witch! You’re a witch!” she continued to chant. 

I was so upset, I totally lost it. “Judith —” I shrieked. “I never would have 
done it to you if you hadn’t been so horrible to me!” 

I realized immediately that I’d made a terrible mistake. 

I had just admitted to her that I was responsible for her being sick. 

I had just blurted out that I was a witch! 

But I was so furious, I didn’t care. 

“I knew it!” Judith croaked in her hoarse voice, her green eyes glowing 
excitedly, pointing an accusing finger at me. 

“What’s going on here? What’s all the shouting?” Judith’s mother appeared 
in the room, her eyes flashing back and forth between Judith and me. 

“She’s a witch! A witch!” Judith screamed. 

“Judith—your voice! Stop!” Mrs. Bellwood cried, running to the bed. She 
turned back to me. “I think Judith is delirious. She—she’s saying such crazy 
things. Please don’t pay attention. She—” 

“She’s a witch! She admitted it! She’s a witch!” Judith shrieked. 

“Judith—please. Please, you have to calm down. You have to save your 
strength,” Mrs. Bellwood pleaded. 

“I’m sorry. I’ll go now,” I said sharply. 

I darted out of the room, ran down the stairs, and out of the house as fast as 
I could. 

“A witch! A witch!” Judith’s hoarse chant followed me out. 

I was so angry, so hurt, so humiliated, I felt about to explode. “I wish Judith 
would disappear!” I screamed. “I really do!” 

“Very well. That shall be your second wish,” said a voice behind me. 

I spun around to see the strange woman standing at the side of the house, 
her long, black hair fluttering behind her in the gusting wind. She held the 
glowing red ball high. Her eyes glowed as red as the ball. 

“I shall cancel your first wish,” she said in her shaky, old lady’s voice. 



“And I shall grant your second.” 



17 


“No—wait!” I cried. 

The woman smiled and pulled her shawl over her head. 

“Wait! I didn’t mean it!” I cried, running toward her. “I didn’t know you 
were there. Wait—OW!” 

My foot caught on a loose stone in the walk, and I stumbled. I hit my knees 
hard. The pain shot up through my entire body. 

When I looked up, she was gone. 

After dinner, Ron agreed to play basketball out back. But it was too cold and 
windy. A light snow had started to fall. 

We settled for Ping-Pong in the basement. 

Ping-Pong games in our basement are always difficult. For one thing, the 
ceiling is so low, the ball is always hitting it and bouncing crazily away. Also, 
Punkin has a bad habit of chasing after the ball and biting holes in it. 

Ping-Pong is the only sport I’m good at. I have a really tricky serve, and 
I’m good at slamming the ball down my opponent’s throat. I can usually beat 
Ron two games out of three. 

But tonight he could see my heart wasn’t in it. 

“What’s up?” he asked as we batted the ball softly back and forth. His dark 
eyes peered into mine from behind his black-framed glasses. 

I decided I had to tell him about Clarissa, and her red crystal ball, and the 
three wishes. I was so desperate to tell someone. 

“I helped this strange woman a few days ago,” I blurted out. “And she 
granted me three wishes. I made a wish, and now all the girls on my basketball 
team are going to die!” 

Ron dropped his paddle onto the table. His mouth dropped open. “What an 
amazing coincidence!” he cried. 

“Huh?” I gaped at him. 

“I met my fairy godmother yesterday!” Ron exclaimed. “She promised to 
make me the richest person in the world, and she’s going to give me a solid gold 
Mercedes with a swimming pool in the back!” 

He burst out laughing. He just thinks he’s such a riot. 



“Aaaaagh!” I let out an angry, frustrated groan. 

Then I tossed my paddle at him and ran upstairs to my room. 

I slammed the bedroom door behind me and began to pace back and forth, my 
arms crossed tightly in front of me. 

I kept telling myself that I had to calm down, that it wasn’t good to be this 
stressed out. But of course, telling yourself to calm down doesn’t do any good. It 
only makes you more tense. 

I decided I had to do something to occupy my mind, to keep myself from 
thinking about Judith, and Clarissa, and the new wish I had accidentally made. 

My second wish. 

“It’s not fair!” I cried aloud, still pacing. 

After all, I didn’t know I was making a second wish. That woman tricked 
me! She appeared out of nowhere—and tricked me! 

I stopped in front of my mirror and fiddled with my hair. I have very fine, 
light blonde hair. It’s so fine, there isn’t much I can do with it. I usually tie it in a 
ponytail on the right side of my head. It’s a style I saw on a model that looked a 
little like me in Seventeen. 

Just to keep my hands busy, I tried doing something else with my hair. 
Studying myself in the mirror, I tried sweeping it straight back. Then I tried 
parting it in the middle and letting it fall over my ears. It looked really lame. 

The activity wasn’t helping. It wasn’t taking my mind off Judith at all. I 
pulled it back into the same old ponytail. Then I brushed it for a while, tossed 
down the brush with a sigh, and returned to pacing. 

My big question, of course, was: Had my wish come true? 

Had I caused Judith to disappear? 

As much as I hated Judith, I certainly didn’t want to be responsible for 
making her disappear forever. 

With a loud moan, I tossed myself down on my bed. What should I do? I 
asked myself. I had to know if the wish had come true. 

I decided to call her house. 

I wouldn’t talk to her. I’d just call her house and see if she was still around. 

I wouldn’t even tell them who was calling. 

I looked up Judith’s number in the school directory. I didn’t know it by 
heart. I had only called it once before. 

My hand was shaking as I reached for the phone on my desk. I punched in 



her phone number. 

It took me three tries. I kept making mistakes. 

I was really scared. I felt as if my stomach were tied in a knot and my heart 
had jumped up into my throat. 

The phone rang. One ring. 

Two rings. 

Three rings. 

Had she disappeared? 



18 


Four rings. 

No answer. 

“She’s gone,” I murmured aloud, a chill running down my back. 

Before the fifth ring could begin, I heard a clicking sound. Someone had 
picked up the receiver. 

“Hello?” 

Judith! 

“Hello? Who is this?” she demanded. 

I slammed the receiver down. 

My heart was pounding. My hands were ice-cold. 

I breathed a sigh of relief. Judith was there. She was definitely there. She 
hadn’t vanished from the face of the earth. 

And, I realized her voice had returned to normal. 

She didn’t sound hoarse or weak. She sounded as nasty as ever. 

What did this mean? I jumped to my feet and began to pace back and forth, 
trying to figure it all out. 

Of course, I couldn ’t figure it out. 

I only knew that the second wish hadn’t been granted. 

Feeling a little relieved, I went to bed and quickly fell into a heavy, 
dreamless sleep. 

I opened one eye, then the other. Pale morning sunlight was shining through my 
bedroom window. With a sleepy groan, I pushed down the covers and started to 
sit up. 

My eye went to the clock above my desk and I gasped. 

Nearly ten after eight? 

I rubbed my eyes and looked again. Yes. Ten after eight. 

“Huh?” I cried, trying to clear the sleep from my voice. Mom wakes me 
every morning at seven so I can get to school by eight-thirty. 

What happened? 

There was no way I’d be on time now. 



“Hey—Mom!” I shouted. “Mom!” I jumped out of bed. My long legs got 
tangled up in the covers, and I nearly fell over. 

Great way to start the day—with a typical Samantha klutz move! 

“Hey, Mom—” I shouted out the bedroom door. “What happened? I’m 
late!” 

Not hearing a reply, I pulled off my nightshirt and quickly searched through 
the closet for some clean clothes to wear. Today was Friday, laundry day. So I 
was down to the bottom of the pile. 

“Hey, Mom? Ron? Anybody up?” 

Dad leaves the house for work every morning at seven. Usually I hear him 
moving around. This morning I hadn’t heard a sound. 

I pulled on a pair of faded jeans and a pale green sweater. Then I brushed 
my hair, staring at my still-sleepy face in the mirror. 

“Anybody up?” I shouted. “How come no one woke me today? It’s not a 
holiday—is it?” 

I listened carefully as I tugged on my Doc Martens. 

No radio on down in the kitchen. How weird, I thought. Mom has that radio 
tuned to the all-news station every morning. We fight about it every morning. 
She wants news, and I want music. 

But today I couldn’t hear a sound down there. 

What’s going on? 

“Hey—I’m going to have to skip breakfast!” I shouted down the stairs. 
“I’m late.” 

No reply. 

I took one last look in the mirror, brushed a strand of hair off my forehead, 
and hurried out into the hall. 

My brother’s room is next door to mine. His door was closed. 

Uh-oh, Ron, I thought. Did you sleep late, too? 

I pounded on the door. “Ron? Ron, are you awake?” 

Silence. 

“Ron?” I pushed open the door. His room was dark, except for the pale light 
from the window. The bed was made. 

Had Ron already left? Why had he made his bed? It would be the first time 
in his life he ever did! 

“Hey, Mom!” Confused, I hurried down the stairs. Halfway down, I 
stumbled and nearly fell. Klutz Move Number Two. Pretty good for so early in 



the morning. 

“What’s going on down here? Is it the weekend? Did I sleep through 
Friday?” 

The kitchen was empty. No Mom. No Ron. No breakfast. 

Did they have to go somewhere early? I checked the refrigerator for a note. 

Nothing. 

Puzzled, I glanced at the clock. Nearly eight-thirty. I was already late for 
school. 

Why didn’t anyone wake me up? Why were they all gone so early in the 
morning? 

I pinched myself. I really did. I thought maybe I was dreaming. 

But no such luck. 

“Hey—anyone?” I called. My voice rang through the empty house. 

I ran to the front closet to get my coat. I had to get to school. I was sure this 
mystery would be cleared up later. 

I quickly pulled on my coat and ran upstairs for my backpack. My stomach 
was grumbling and growling. I was used to at least a glass of juice and a bowl of 
cereal for breakfast. 

Oh, well, I thought, I’ll buy an extra big lunch. 

A few seconds later, I headed out the front door and around to the side to 
the garage to get my bike. I pulled up the garage door—and stopped. 

I froze, staring into the garage. 

My dad’s car. It was still in the garage. 

He hadn’t left for work. 

So where was everyone ? 



19 


Back in my house I phoned my dad’s office. The phone rang and rang, and no 
one answered. 

I checked the kitchen again for a message from Mom or Dad. But I couldn’t 
find a thing. 

Glancing at the kitchen clock, I saw that I was already twenty minutes late 
for school. I needed a late excuse note, but there was no one to write it for me. 

I hurried back outside to get my bike. Better late than never, I thought. I 
wasn’t exactly frightened. I was just puzzled. 

I’ll call Mom or Dad at lunchtime and find out where everyone went this 
morning, I told myself. As I pedaled to school, I began to feel a little angry. They 
could’ve at least told me they were leaving early! 

There were no cars on the street, and no kids on bikes. I guessed that 
everyone was already at school or work or wherever people go in the morning. I 
got to school in record time. 

Leaving my bike in the bike rack, I adjusted my backpack on my shoulders 
and ran into the school. The halls were dark and empty. My footsteps echoed 
loudly on the hard floor. 

I dropped my coat into my locker. When I slammed the locker door, it 
sounded like an explosion in the empty hallway. 

The halls are kind of creepy when they’re this empty, I thought. I jogged to 
my classroom, which was just a few doors down from my locker. 

“My mom forgot to wake me, so I overslept.” 

That was the excuse I’d planned to give Sharon as soon as I entered. I 
mean, it wasn’t just an excuse. It was the truth. 

But I never got to tell Sharon my reason for being late. 

I pulled open the door to the classroom—and stared in shock. 

Empty. The room was empty. 

No kids. No Sharon. 

The lights hadn’t been turned on. And yesterday’s work was still on the 
chalkboard. 

Weird, I thought. 

But I didn’t know then how weird things were going to get. 



I froze for a moment, staring into the empty, dark room. Then I decided that 
everyone must be at an assembly in the auditorium. 

I turned quickly and made my way to the auditorium at the front of the 
school, jogging down the empty corridor. 

The door to the teachers’ lounge was open. I peered in and was surprised to 
find it empty, too. Maybe all the teachers are at the assembly, I thought. 

A few seconds later, I pulled open the double doors to the auditorium. 

And peered into the darkness. 

The auditorium was silent and empty. 

I pushed the doors shut and began to run down the hall, stopping to look 
into every room. 

It didn’t take me long to realize that I was the only person in the building. 
No kids. No teachers. I even checked the janitors’ room downstairs. No janitors. 

Is it Sunday? Is it a holiday? 

I tried to figure out where everyone had gone, but I couldn’t. 

Feeling the first stirrings of panic in my chest, I dropped a quarter in the 
pay phone next to the principal’s office and called home. 

I let it ring at least ten times. Still no one home. 

“Where is everyone?” I shouted down the empty corridor. The only reply 
came from my echoing voice. 

“Can anybody hear me?” I shouted, cupping my hands around my mouth. 
Silence. 

I suddenly felt very frightened. I had to get out of the creepy school 
building. I grabbed my coat and started to run. I didn’t even bother to close the 
locker door. 

Carrying my coat over my shoulder, I ran outside, to the bike rack. My bike 
was the only bike parked there. I scolded myself for not noticing that when I 
arrived. 

I pulled on my coat, arranged my backpack, and started for home. Again, I 
saw no cars on the street. No people. 

“This is so weirdl” I cried aloud. 

My legs suddenly felt heavy, as if something was weighing them down. I 
knew it was my panic. My heart was pounding. I kept searching desperately for 
someone—anyone—on the street. 

Halfway home, I turned around and headed my bike to town. The small 
shopping district was just a few blocks north of school. 



I rode in the center of the street. There was no reason not to. No cars or 
trucks appeared in either direction. 

The bank came into view, followed by the grocery store. As I pedaled as 
hard as I could, I noticed all the other shops that lined both sides of Montrose 
Avenue. 

All dark and empty. 

Not a soul in town. Not a person in any store. 

No one. 

I braked the bike in front of Farber’s Hardware and jumped off. The bike 
fell onto its side. I stepped to the sidewalk and listened. The only sound was the 
banging of a shutter being blown by the wind above the barbershop. 

“Hello!” I called at the top of my voice. “Hellllooooo!” 

I started running frantically from store to store, pressing my face against the 
windows, peering inside, searching desperately for another human being. 

Back and forth. I covered both sides of the street, my fear growing heavier 
inside me with each step. With each dark store. 

“Hellooooo! Helllooooo! Can anybody hear me?” 

But I knew it was a waste of my voice. 

Standing in the center of the street, staring at the dark stores and empty 
sidewalks, I knew that I was alone. 

Alone in the world. 

I suddenly realized my second wish had been granted. 

Judith had disappeared. And everyone else had disappeared with her. 

Everyone. 

My mom and dad. My brother, Ron. Everyone. 

Would I ever see them again? 

I slumped down on the cement stoop in front of the barbershop and hugged 
myself, trying to stop my body from trembling. 

Now what? I wondered miserably. Now what? 



20 


I don’t know how long I sat there on the stoop, hugging myself, my head 
lowered, my mind in a total, spinning panic. I would have sat there forever, 
listening to the banging shutter, listening to the wind blow through the deserted 
street—if my stomach hadn’t started to growl and grumble. 

I stood up, suddenly remembering that I had missed my breakfast. 

“Sam, you’re all alone in the world. How can you think about eating?” I 
asked myself aloud. 

Somehow it was comforting to hear a human voice, even though it was my 

own. 

“I’m staaaaarving!” I shouted. 

I listened for a response. It was really stupid, but I refused to give up hope. 

“This is all Judith’s fault,” I muttered, picking my bike up from the street. 

I rode home through the empty streets, my eyes searching the deserted 
yards and houses. As I passed the Carters’ house on the corner of my block, I 
expected their little white terrier to come yapping after my bike the way he 
always did. 

But there weren’t even any dogs left in my world. Not even my poor little 
Punkin. 

There was just me. Samantha Byrd. The last person on earth. 

As soon as I got home, I rushed into the kitchen and made myself a peanut butter 
sandwich. Gobbling it down, I stared at the open peanut butter jar. It was nearly 
empty. 

“How am I going to feed myself?” I wondered aloud. “What do I do when 
the food runs out?” 

I started to fill a glass with orange juice. But I hesitated, and filled it up 
only halfway. 

Do I rob the grocery store? I asked myself. Do I just take the food I need? 

Is it really robbing if there’s no one there? If there’s no one anywhere ? 

Does it matter? Does anything matter? 

“How can I take care of myself? I’m only twelve!” I shouted. 

For the first time, I felt the urge to cry. But I jammed another hunk of 



peanut butter sandwich into my mouth and forced the urge away. 

Instead, I turned my thoughts to Judith, and my unhappiness and fear 
quickly gave way to anger. 

If Judith hadn’t made fun of me, hadn’t tried to embarrass me, if Judith 
hadn’t constantly sneered at me and said, “Byrd, why don’t you just fly away!” 
and all the other horrible things she’d said to me, then I never would have made 
any wishes about her, and I wouldn’t be all alone now. 

“I hate you, Judith!” I screamed. 

I jammed the last section of sandwich into my mouth—but I didn’t chew. 

I froze. And listened. 

I heard something. 

Footsteps. Someone walking in the living room. 



21 


I swallowed the sandwich section whole, and went tearing into the living room. 
“Mom? Dad?” 

Were they back? Were they really back? 

No. 

I stopped in the living room doorway when I saw Clarissa. She was 
standing in the center of the room, her black hair reflecting the light from the 
front window, a pleased smile on her face. 

Her bright red shawl was draped loosely over her shoulders. She wore a 
long black jumper over a white, high-collared blouse. 

“You!” I cried breathlessly. “How did you get in?” 

She shrugged. Her smile grew wider. 

“Why did you do this to me?” I shrieked, my anger bursting out of me. 
“How could you do this to me?” I demanded, gesturing at the empty room, the 
empty house. 

“I didn’t,” she replied quietly. 

She walked to the window. In the bright afternoon sunlight, her skin 
appeared pale and wrinkled. She looked so old. 

“But—but—” I sputtered, too furious to speak. 

“You did it,” she said, her smile fading. “You made the wish. I granted it.” 

“I didn’t wish for my family to disappear!” I screamed, striding into the 
room, my hands balled into tight fists. “I didn’t wish for everyone in the world to 
disappear! You did that! You!” 

“You wished for Judith Bellwood to disappear,” Clarissa said, adjusting the 
shawl on her shoulders. “I granted the wish as best as I knew how.” 

“No. You tricked me,” I insisted angrily. 

She snickered. “Magic is often unpredictable,” she said. “I figured you 
would not be happy with your last wish. That is why I have returned. You have 
one more wish. Would you like to make it now?” 

“Yes!” I exclaimed. “I want my family back. I want all the people back. I 

“Be careful,” she warned, pulling the red glass ball from the purple bag. 
“Think carefully before you make your final wish. I am trying to repay your 



kindness to me. I do not want you to be unhappy with the results of your wish.” 

I started to reply, but stopped. 

She was right. I had to be careful. 

I had to make the right wish this time. And I had to say it the right way. 
“Take your time,” she urged softly. “Since this is your final wish, it shall be 
permanent. Be very careful.” 

I stared into her eyes as they turned from black to red, reflecting the red 
glow of the ball in her hand, and I thought as hard as I could. 

What should I wish for? 



22 


The light from the living room window faded as clouds rolled over the sun. As 
the light dimmed, the old woman’s face darkened. Deep black ruts formed 
beneath her eyes. Lines creased her forehead. She seemed to sag into the 
shadows. 

“Here is my wish,” I said in a trembling voice. I spoke slowly, carefully. I 
wanted to consider each word. I didn’t want to slip up this time. 

I didn’t want to give her a chance to trick me. 

“I am listening,” she whispered, her face completely covered by shadow 
now. Except for her eyes, glowing as red as fire. 

I cleared my throat. I took a deep breath. 

“Here is my wish,” I repeated carefully. “I wish for everything to return to 
normal. I want everything to be exactly the way it was—but—” 

I hesitated. 

Should I finish this part of it? 

Yes! I told myself. 

“I want everything to be the way it was—but I want Judith to think that I’m 
the greatest person who ever lived!” 

“I will grant your third wish,” she said, raising the glass ball high. “Your 
second wish will be canceled. Time will back up to this morning. Goodbye, 
Samantha.” 

“Good-bye,” I said. 

I was swallowed up by the radiating red glow. When it faded, Clarissa had 
vanished. 

“Sam! Sam—rise and shine!” 

My mother’s voice floated up to my room from downstairs. 

I sat straight up in bed, instantly awake. “Mom!” I cried happily. 

I remembered everything. I remembered waking up in an empty house, in 
an empty world. And I remembered my third wish. 

But time had gone back to this morning. I glanced at the clock. Seven. 
Mom was waking me up at the usual time. 

“Mom!” I leapt out of bed, ran downstairs in my nightshirt, and joyfully 



threw my arms around her, hugging her tight. “Mom!” 

“Sam? Are you okay?” She stepped back, a startled expression on her face. 
“You running a fever?” 

“Good morning!” I cried happily, hugging Punkin, who seemed just as 
startled. “Is Dad still home?” I was so eager to see him, too, to know that he was 
back. 

“He left a few minutes ago,” Mom said, still examining me suspiciously 
with her eyes. 

“Oh, Mom!” I exclaimed. I couldn’t conceal my happiness. I hugged her 
again. 

“Whoa.” I heard Ron enter the kitchen behind us. 

I turned to see him staring at me, his eyes narrowed in disbelief behind his 
glasses. I ran over and hugged him, too. 

“Mom—what did you put in her orange juice?” he demanded, struggling to 
back away from me. “Yuck! Let go of me!” 

Mom shrugged. “Don’t ever ask me to explain your sister,” she replied 
dryly. She turned to the kitchen cabinets. “Go get dressed, Sam. You don’t want 
to be late.” 

“What a beautiful morning!” I exclaimed. 

“Yeah. Beautiful,” Ron repeated, yawning. “You must have had some 
terrific dreams or something, Sam.” 

I laughed and hurried upstairs to get dressed. 

I couldn’t wait to get to school. I couldn’t wait to see my friends, to see the halls 
filled once again with talking, laughing faces. 

Pedaling my bike as hard as I could, I grinned every time a car passed. I 
loved seeing people again. I waved at Mrs. Miller across the street, bending to 
pick up her morning newspaper. 

I didn’t even mind it when the Carters’ terrier came chasing after my bike, 
barking his high-pitched yips and nipping at my ankles. 

“Good dog!” I cried gleefully. 

Everything is normal, I told myself. Everything is wonderfully normal. 

I opened the front door to school to the sound of crashing locker doors and 
shouting kids. “Great!” I cried aloud. 

A sixth-grader came tearing around the corner and bumped right into me, 
practically knocking me over as I made my way to my locker. I didn’t cry out 



angrily. I just smiled. 

I was so happy to be back in school, back in my crowded noisy school. 

Unable to stop grinning, I unlocked my locker and pulled open the door. I 
called out a cheerful greeting to some friends across the hall. 

I even said good morning to Mrs. Reynolds, our principal! 

“Hey—Stork!” a seventh-grade boy called to me. He made a funny face, 
then disappeared around the corner. 

I didn’t care. I didn’t care what anyone called me. The sound of so many 
voices was so wonderful! 

As I started to take my coat off, I saw Judith and Anna arrive. 

They were busy chatting, both talking at once. But Judith stopped when she 
saw me. 

“Hi, Judith,” I called warily. I wondered what Judith would be like now. 
Would she treat me any differently? Would she be nicer to me? 

Would she remember how much she and I used to hate each other? 

Would she be any different at all? 

Judith gave Anna a little wave and came hurrying over to me. “Morning, 
Sam,” she said, and smiled. 

Then she pulled off her wool ski cap—and I gasped. 



23 


“Judith—your hair!” I cried in astonishment. 

“Do you like it?” she asked, staring at me eagerly. 

She had cut it shorter like mine and had tied a pony tail on the side—just 
like mine! 

“I—I guess...” I stammered. 

She breathed a sigh of relief and smiled at me. “Oh, I’m so glad you like it, 
Sam!” she cried gratefully. “It looks just like yours, doesn’t it? Or did I cut it too 
short? Do you think it should be longer?” She studied my hair. “I think yours 
might be longer.” 

“No. No. It’s... great, Judith,” I told her, backing toward my locker. 

“Of course, it’s not as good as yours,” Judith continued, staring at my 
ponytail. “My hair just isn’t as pretty as yours. It isn’t as fine, and the color is 
too dark.” 

I don’t believe this! I thought. 

“It looks good,” I said softly. 

I pulled my coat off and hung it in my locker. Then I bent to pick up my 
backpack. 

“Let me carry that,” Judith insisted. She grabbed it out of my hands. 
“Really. I don’t mind, Sam.” 

I started to protest, but Anna interrupted. “What are you doing?” she asked 
Judith, flashing me a cold glance. “Let’s get to class.” 

“You go without me,” Judith replied. “I want to carry Sam’s backpack for 

her.” 

“Huh?” Anna’s mouth dropped open. “Are you totally losing it, Judith?” 
she demanded. 

Judith ignored her question and turned back to me. “I love that T-shirt, Sam. 
It’s ribbed, isn’t it? Did you get it at the Gap? That’s where I got mine. Look. 
I’m wearing one just like yours.” 

I goggled in surprise. Sure enough, Judith was wearing the same style T- 
shirt, only hers was gray and mine was pale blue. 

“Judith—what’s your problem?” Anna asked, applying a twentieth layer of 
bright orange lipstick on her lips. “And what did you do to your hair?” she cried, 



suddenly noticing the new style. 

“Doesn’t it look just like Sam’s?” Judith asked her, flipping the ponytail 
with one hand. 

Anna rolled her eyes. “Judith, have you gone psycho or something?” 

“Give me a break, Anna,” Judith replied. “I’d like to talk to Sam—okay?” 

“Huh?” Anna knocked on Judith’s head, as if knocking on a door. “Anyone 
home?” 

“See you later, okay?” Judith said impatiently. 

Anna sighed, then walked away angrily. 

Judith turned back to me. “Can I ask you a favor?” 

“Yeah. Sure,” I replied. “What kind of favor?” 

She hoisted my backpack over her left shoulder. Her own backpack hung on 
her right shoulder. “Would you help me work on my foul shot at practice this 
afternoon?” 

I wasn’t sure I had heard Judith correctly. I stared at her, my mouth hanging 
open. 

“Would you?” she pleaded. “I’d really like to try shooting fouls your way. 
You know. Underhanded. I bet I’d have a lot more control shooting them 
underhanded, the way you do.” 

This was too much! Too much! 

As I stared at Judith, I saw absolute worship in her eyes! 

She was the best foul shooter on the team. And here she was, begging me to 
show her how to shoot the klutzy way I did it! 

“Yeah. Okay. I’ll try to help you,” I told her. 

“Oh, thank you, Sam!” she cried gratefully. “You’re such a pal! And do you 
think I could borrow your social studies notes later? Mine are such a mess.” 

“Well...” I said thoughtfully. My notes were so bad, even I couldn’t make 
them out. 

“I’ll copy them over and get them right back to you. Promise,” Judith said 
breathlessly. I think the weight of two backpacks was starting to get to her. 

“Okay. You can borrow them,” I told her. 

We started walking to class. Several kids stopped to stare at Judith, lugging 
two backpacks on her shoulders. 

“Where did you get your Doc Martens?” she asked as we entered the room. 
“I want to get a pair just like yours.” 

What a laugh! I thought, very pleased with myself. This is an absolute riot! 



The change in Judith was simply hilarious. It was all I could do not to burst 
out laughing. 

Little did I know then that my laughter would quickly turn to horror. 



24 


It started to get really embarrassing. Judith wouldn’t leave me alone. 

She hung around me wherever I went. When I got up to sharpen my pencil, 
she followed me and sharpened hers. 

My throat got dry during a spelling test, and I asked Lisa if I could run out 
to the water fountain to get a drink. As I was bending over the fountain, I turned 
and saw Judith right behind me. “My throat is dry like yours,” she explained, 
faking a cough. 

Later, during free reading, Lisa had to separate Judith and me because 
Judith wouldn’t stop talking. 

At lunch, I took my usual place across the table from Cory. I had just started 
telling him about Judith’s new attitude—when she appeared at our table. 

“Could you move down a seat?” she asked the kid sitting next to me. “I 
want to sit next to Sam.” 

The kid moved, and Judith dropped her lunch tray onto the table and took 
her seat. “Would you like to trade lunches?” she asked me. “Yours looks so 
much better than mine.” 

I was holding a mushed-up tunafish sandwich. “This?” I asked, waving it. 
Half the tunafish fell out of the soggy bread. 

“Yum!” Judith exclaimed. “Want my pizza, Sam? Here. Take it.” She slid 
her tray in front of me. “You bring the best lunches. I wish my mom packed 
lunches like yours.” 

I could see Cory staring at me across the table, his eyes wide with disbelief. 

I really couldn’t believe it, either. All Judith wanted from the world was to 
be exactly like me! 

A few tables away, near the wall, Anna sat by herself. She looked really 
glum. I saw her glance over to our table, frowning. Then she quickly lowered her 
eyes to her lunch. 

After lunch, Judith followed me to my locker. She helped me pull out my 
books and notebooks and asked if she could carry my backpack. 

At first, I thought this was all really funny. But then I started to get 
annoyed. And embarrassed. 

I saw that kids were laughing at us. Two boys from my class followed us 



down the hall, snickering. I heard other kids talking about Judith and me in the 
hall. They stopped when Judith and I walked by, but I saw amused smirks on 
their faces. 

She’s making me look like a total jerk! I realized. 

The whole school is laughing at us! 

“Are you getting braces?” Judith asked me as we made our way back to the 
classroom. “Someone told me you were getting braces.” 

“Yeah. I’m getting them,” I grumbled, rolling my eyes. 

“Great!” Judith declared. “Then I want to get them, too!” 

After school I hurried to the gym, expecting to have basketball practice. In all 
the excitement over the wishes, I had forgotten that we had an actual game that 
afternoon. 

The girls’ team from Edgemont Middle School was already on the floor, 
warming up by shooting lay-ups. Most of their shots were dropping in. They 
were big, tough-looking girls. We had heard that they were a really good team— 
and they looked it. 

I changed quickly and hurried out of the locker room. My teammates were 
huddled around Ellen for last-minute instructions. As I jogged over to them, I 
crossed my fingers on both hands and prayed that I wouldn’t make too big a fool 
of myself in the game. 

Judith grinned at me as I joined the huddle. Then she practically 
embarrassed me out of my Reeboks by shouting, “Here she is! Here comes our 
star!” 

Anna and the others laughed, of course. 

But then their smiles quickly faded when Judith interrupted Ellen to 
announce, “Before the game starts, I think we should name Sam team captain.” 

“You’re joking!” Anna cried. 

A few girls laughed. Ellen stared at me, bewildered. 

“Our best player should be captain,” Judith continued in all seriousness. 
“So it should be Sam, not me. All in favor, raise your hand.” 

Judith shot her hand up in the air, but no one else did. 

“What’s your problem?” Anna asked her nastily. “What are you trying to 
do, Judith—ruin our team?” 

Judith and Anna got into an angry shouting match over that, and Ellen had 
to pull them apart. 



Ellen stared at Judith as if she had lost her mind or something. Then she 
said, “Let’s worry about who’s captain later. Let’s just go out and play a good 
game, okay?” 

The game was a disaster. Judith copied everything I did. If I tried to dribble, and 
tripped over my feet, Judith would dribble and trip. If I threw a bad pass that was 
intercepted by the other team, Judith would throw a bad pass. 

When I missed an easy lay-up under the basket, Judith did the same thing, 
deliberately missing the next time she had the ball. 

It was one flub after another—doubled because of Judith copying me! 

And the whole time, she kept clapping and shouting, cheering me on. “Way 
to go, Sam! Nice try, Sam! You’re the best, Sam!” 

It was so obnoxious! 

And I could see the girls on the Edgemont team snickering at us, and 
laughing out loud when Judith fell head-first into the bleachers just because I 
had done it a few plays before. 

Anna and the other players on my team weren’t laughing. Their expressions 
were glum and angry. 

“You’re deliberately messing up!” Anna accused Judith about halfway 
through the game. 

“I am not!” Judith replied shrilly. 

“Why are you copying that clumsy ox?” I heard Anna demand. 

Judith grabbed her and knocked her down, and they began wrestling angrily 
on the floor, screaming and tearing at each other furiously. 

It took Ellen and the referee to stop the fight. Both girls were given a harsh 
lecture about sportsmanship and sent to the locker room. 

Ellen made me sit down on the bench. I was glad. I really didn’t feel like 
playing anymore. 

As I watched the rest of the game, I couldn’t concentrate on it at all. I kept 
thinking about my third and final wish, and how I’d blown it again. 

To my dismay, I realized that having Judith worship me was much worse 
than having her hate me! At least when she hated me, she left me alone! 

I had made three wishes, and each of them had turned into a nightmare. 
Now I was stuck with Judith following me around, hanging on my every word, 
constantly praising everything I did, fawning over me like a lovesick puppy— 
and, mainly, being an unbelievable pest! 



I actually longed for the days when she had made fun of me in front of the 
whole class, when she had followed after me, calling, “Byrd, why don’t you fly 
away! Why don’t you fly away, Byrd!” 

But what could I do? My three wishes were up. 

Was I going to be stuck with Judith for the rest of my life? 

We lost the game by fifteen or sixteen points. I didn’t pay much attention to 
the score. I just wanted to get out of there. 

But when I trudged into the locker room to change, Judith was waiting for 
me. She handed me a towel. “Good game!” she cried, slapping me a high-five. 

“Huh?” I could only gape at her. 

“Can we study together after dinner?” she asked with pleading eyes. 
“Please? You could help me with my algebra. You’re so much better at it than I 
am. You’re a real genius when it comes to algebra.” 

Luckily, I had to go with my parents to visit my aunt after dinner. That gave me a 
good excuse not to study with Judith. 

But what would be my excuse the next night? And the next, and the next? 

My aunt wasn’t feeling well, and the purpose of our visit was to cheer her 
up. I’m afraid I didn’t do a very good job. I barely said a word. 

I couldn’t stop thinking about Judith. 

What could I do about her? I could get angry and tell her to leave me alone. 
But I knew that wouldn’t help. I had wished for her to think I was the greatest 
person who ever lived. Now Judith was under an enchantment, under the power 
of the Crystal Woman’s spell. 

Telling her to go away wouldn’t discourage her in the least. 

Could I just ignore her? That wouldn’t be easy since she was constantly in 
my shadow, asking me a million questions, begging to wait on me like a servant. 

What could I do? What? 

I thought about it all the way home. Even my parents noticed I was 
distracted. 

“What’s the problem, Sam?” my mother demanded as we drove home. 

“Oh, nothing,” I lied. “Just thinking about schoolwork.” 

When we got home, there were four phone messages on the answering 
machine for me, all from Judith. 

My mother stared at me, curious. “That’s funny. I don’t remember your 
being friends with her before,” she said. 



“Yeah. She’s in my class,” I told her. I didn’t want to explain. I knew I 
couldn ’t explain. 

I hurried up to my room. I was totally exhausted, from all the worrying, I 
guess. I got changed into a nightshirt, clicked off the light, and climbed into bed. 

For a while, I lay staring up at the ceiling, watching shadows of the tree 
outside my window weave back and forth. I tried to clear my mind, tried to 
picture fluffy white sheep leaping over fluffy white clouds. 

I was just drifting off to sleep when I heard the floorboards creak. 

Opening my eyes wide, I saw a black shadow move against the darkness of 
my closet. 

I uttered a choked cry as I realized that someone was in my room. 

Before I could move, a hot, dry hand grabbed me by the arm. 



25 


I tried to scream, but the hand slid up over my mouth. 

I—I’m going to choke! I thought, frozen in panic. I can’t breathe! 

“Shh—don’t scream!” my attacker whispered. 

The light clicked on. 

The hand left my mouth. 

“Judith!” I rasped, my voice catching in my throat. 

She smiled at me, her green eyes flashing with excitement, and raised a 
finger to her lips. “Sshhh.” 

“Judith—what are you doing here?” I managed to cry, finding my voice. 
My heart was still pounding so hard, I could barely breathe. “How did you get 
in?” 

“Your back door was unlocked,” she whispered. “I hid in the closet to wait 
for you. I guess I fell asleep for a little while.” 

“But why?” I demanded angrily. I pulled myself up and lowered my feet to 
the floor. “What do you want?” 

Her smile faded. Her mouth formed a pout. “You said we could study 
together,” she said in a little-girl voice. “So I waited for you, Sam.” 

This was the last straw. “Get out!” I cried. 

I started to say more, but a knock on my door startled me into silence. 

“Sam—are you okay?” my dad called in. “Are you talking to someone?” 

“No. I’m fine, Dad,” I said. 

“You’re not on the phone, are you?” he asked suspiciously. “You know 
you’re not supposed to call people this late.” 

“No. I’m going to sleep now,” I told him. 

I waited till I heard his footsteps on the stairs. Then I turned back to Judith. 
“You have to go home,” I whispered. “As soon as the coast is clear—” 

“But why?” she demanded, hurt. “You said we’d study our algebra.” 

“I did not!” I cried. “Anyway, it’s too late. You have to go home. Your 
parents must be going nuts worrying about you, Judith.” 

She shook her head. “I sneaked out. They think I’m asleep in bed.” She 
smiled. “But that’s so great of you to worry about my parents, Sam. You really 



are the most considerate girl I know.” 

Her stupid compliment made me even angrier. I was so furious, I wanted to 
tear her apart with my bare hands. 

“I love your room,” she gushed, glancing around quickly. “Did you pick out 
all the posters yourself?” 

I sighed in total exasperation. 

“Judith, I just want you to go home—now,” I snarled slowly, one word at a 
time, so that maybe she would hear me. 

“Can we study together tomorrow?” she pleaded. “I really need your help, 
Sam.” 

“Maybe,” I replied. “But you can’t sneak into my house anymore, and—” 

“You’re so smart,” Judith gushed. “Where did you get that nightshirt? The 
stripes are terrific. I wish I had one like it.” 

Motioning for her to be silent, I crept out into the hall. All the lights had 
been turned off. My parents had gone to bed. 

Tugging Judith by the hand, I led the way downstairs, tiptoeing silently, 
taking it one step at a time. Then I practically shoved her out the front door and 
swung it closed with a soft click behind her. 

I stood in the dark entryway, panting hard, my mind racing. 

What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? 

It took me hours to get to sleep. And when I finally drifted off, I dreamed 
about Judith. 

“You look tired, dear,” my mom said at breakfast. 

“I didn’t sleep very well,” I confessed. 

When I headed out the front door to go to school, Judith was waiting for me 
by the driveway. 

She smiled at me and waved cheerily. “I thought we could walk to school 
this morning,” she chirped. “But if you want to ride your bike, I’ll be happy to 
mn alongside.” 

“No!” I shrieked. “No! Please—no!” 

I totally lost it. I just couldn’t stand it anymore. 

I dropped my backpack and started to run. I didn’t know where I was 
running. And I didn’t care. 

I just knew I had to run away from her. 

“Sam—wait! Wait up!” 



I turned to see her chasing after me. “No—please! Go away! Go away!” I 
screamed. 

But I could see her pick up speed, her sneakers thudding against the 
sidewalk, starting to catch up. 

I turned into someone’s yard and ran behind a hedge, trying to lose her. 

I didn’t really know what I was doing. I had no plan, no destination. I just 
had to run ! 

I was running through back yards now, across driveways, behind garages. 

And Judith followed, running at full speed, her short ponytail bobbing as 
she ran. “Sam—wait! Sam!” she called breathlessly. 

Suddenly I was running through woods, a thick tangle of trees and tall 
weeds. I weaved through them, first this way, then that, jumping over fallen 
branches, plunging through thick piles of dead, brown leaves. 

I’ve got to lose her! I told myself. I’ve got to get away! 

But then I stumbled over an upraised tree root and fell, sprawling face down 
on the carpet of dead leaves. 

Typical klutz move. 

And a second later, Judith was standing over me. 



26 


I glanced up from the ground—and saw to my shock that it wasn’t Judith. 

Clarissa hovered over me, her red shawl tight around her shoulders, her 
black eyes staring intently. 

“You!” I cried angrily, and started to scramble to my feet. 

“You are unhappy,” she said softly, frowning. 

“Your wishes have ruined my life!” I cried, furiously brushing dead leaves 
off the front of my sweater. 

“I don’t want you to be unhappy,” she replied. “I was trying to repay your 
kindness.” 

“I wish I’d never met you!” I cried angrily. 

“Very well.” She raised the round red crystal ball in one hand. As she raised 
it, her dark eyes began to glow, the same scarlet color as the crystal. “I will 
cancel your third wish. Make one final wish. Since you are so unhappy, I shall 
grant you one more.” 

I could hear the crunching of the leaves close behind me. Judith was 
catching up. 

“I—I wish I’d never met you!” I cried to the Crystal Woman. “I wish Judith 
had met you instead of me!” 

The crystal glowed brighter until the red light surrounded me in its glare. 

When it faded, I was standing on the edge of the woods. 

Whew! I thought. What a relief! What a great break! 

I’m so lucky! 

I could see Judith and Clarissa standing in the shade of a wide tree. They 
were huddled together, talking intently. 

This is the perfect revenge! I told myself. Now Judith will make a wish— 
and her life will be totally ruined! 

Chuckling to myself, I strained to hear what they were saying. I was dying 
to know what Judith would wish for. 

I’m pretty sure I heard Judith say, “Byrd, why don’t you fly away!” 

But that didn’t make any sense. 

I was so happy! So deliriously happy! 



I was free, totally free! 

I suddenly felt so different. Lighter. Happier. 

Let Judith have her wishes! I thought gleefully. Let her see what it’s like! 

Tilting my head, I saw a juicy, brown earthworm poke its head up from the 
ground. All of a sudden I was feeling pretty hungry. I jabbed my head forward 
and caught the end of the worm. Then I ate it. 

Very tasty. 

I fluttered my wings, testing the wind. 

Then I took off, flying low over the woods. 

The cool breeze felt so refreshing against my feathers. 

As I fluttered my wings harder, swooping higher into the sky, I glanced 
down and saw Judith. She was standing beside Clarissa. 

Judith stared up at me from the ground, and I guess she got her first wish— 
because she had the biggest smile on her face!

Goosebumps - 13 
R.L. Stine 


1 


I thought I was going to hate moving into a new house. But actually, I had fun. 

I played a pretty mean joke on Mom and Dad. 

While they were busy in the front room showing the moving men where to 
put stuff, I went exploring. I found a really neat room to the side of the dining 
room. 

It had big windows on two sides looking out onto the back yard. Sunlight 
poured in, making the room brighter and a lot more cheery than the rest of the 
old house. 

The room was going to be our new family room. You know, with a TV and 
CD player, and maybe a Ping-Pong table and stuff. But right now it was 
completely empty. 

Except for two gray balls of dust in one corner, which gave me an idea. 

Chuckling to myself, I bent down and shaped the two dust balls with my 
hands. Then I began shouting in a real panicky voice: “Mice! Mice! Help! 
Mice!” 

Mom and Dad came bursting into the room at the same time. Their mouths 
nearly dropped to the floor when they saw the two gray dust mice. 

I kept screaming, “Mice! Mice!” Pretending I was scared of them. Trying 
hard to keep a straight face. 

Mom just stood in the doorway, her mouth hanging open. I really thought 
she was going to drop her teeth! 

Dad always panics more than Mom. He picked up a broom that was leaning 
against the wall, ran across the room, and began pounding the poor, defenseless 
dust mice with it. 

By that time, I was laughing my head off. 

Dad stared down at the glob of dust stuck to the end of the broom, and he 
finally caught on it was a joke. His face got real red, and I thought his eyes were 
going to pop out from behind his glasses. 

“Very funny, Jerome,” Mom said calmly, rolling her eyes. Everyone calls 
me Jerry, but she calls me Jerome when she’s upset with me. “Your father and I 
sure appreciate your scaring us to death when we’re both very nervous and 
overworked and trying to get moved into this house.” 



Mom is always real sarcastic like that. I think I probably get my sense of 
humor from her. 

Dad just scratched the bald spot on the back of his head. “They really 
looked like mice,” he muttered. He wasn’t angry. He’s used to my jokes. They 
both are. 

“Why can’t you act your age?” Mom asked, shaking her head. 

“I am!” I insisted. I mean, I’m twelve. So I was acting my age. If you can’t 
play jokes on your parents and try to have a little fun at twelve, when can you? 

“Don’t be such a smart guy,” Dad said, giving me his stern look. “There’s a 
lot of work to be done around here, you know, Jerry. You could help out.” 

He shoved the broom toward me. 

I raised both hands as if shielding myself from danger, and backed away. 
“Dad, you know I’m allergic!” I cried. 

“Allergic to dust?” he asked. 

“No. Allergic to work!” 

I expected them to laugh, but they just stormed out of the room, muttering 
to themselves. “You can at least look after Bonkers,” Mom called back to me. 
“Keep her out of the movers’ way.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” I called back. Bonkers is our cat, and there’s no way I can 
keep Bonkers from doing anything! 

Let me say right out that Bonkers is not my favorite member of our family. 
In fact, I keep as far away from Bonkers as I can. 

No one ever explained to the stupid cat that she’s supposed to be a pet. 
Instead, I think Bonkers believes she’s a wild, man-eating tiger. Or maybe a 
vampire bat. 

Her favorite trick is to climb up on the back of a chair or a high shelf—and 
then leap with her claws out onto your shoulders. I can’t tell you how many good 
T-shirts have been ripped to shreds by this trick of hers. Or how much blood I’ve 
lost. 

The cat is nasty—just plain vicious. 

She’s all black except for a white circle over her forehead and one eye. 
Mom and Dad think she’s just wonderful. They’re always picking her up, and 
petting her, and telling her how adorable she is. Bonkers usually scratches them 
and makes them bleed. But they never learn. 

When we moved to this new house, I was hoping maybe Bonkers would get 
left behind. But, no way. Mom made sure that Bonkers was in the car first, right 



next to me. 

And of course the stupid cat threw up in the back seat. 

Whoever heard of a cat who gets carsick? She did it deliberately because 
she’s horrible and vicious. 

Anyway, I ignored Mom’s request to keep an eye on her. In fact, I crept into 
the kitchen and opened the back door, hoping maybe Bonkers would run away 
and get lost. 

Then I continued my exploring. 

Our other house was tiny, but new. This house was old. The floorboards 
creaked. The windows rattled. The house seemed to groan when you walked 
through it. 

But it was really big. I discovered all kinds of little rooms and deep closets. 
One upstairs closet was as big as my old bedroom! 

My new bedroom was at the end of the hall on the second floor. There were 
three other rooms and a bathroom up there. I wondered what Mom and Dad 
planned to do with all those rooms. 

I decided to suggest that one of them be made into a Nintendo room. We 
could put a wide-screen TV in there to play the games on. It would be really 
neat. 

As I made plans for my new video game room, I started to feel a little 
cheered up. I mean, it isn’t easy to move to a new house in a new town. 

I’m not the kind of kid who cries much. But I have to admit that I felt like 
crying a lot when we moved away from Cedarville. Especially when I had to say 
good-bye to my friends. 

Especially Sean. Sean is a great guy. Mom and Dad don’t like him too 
much because he’s kind of noisy and he likes to burp real loud. But Sean is my 
best friend. 

I mean he was my best friend. 

I don’t have any friends here in New Goshen. 

Mom said Sean could come stay with us for a few weeks this summer. That 
was really nice of her, especially since she hates his burping so much. 

But it didn’t really cheer me up. 

Exploring the new house was making me feel a little better. The room next 
to mine can be a gym, I decided. We’ll get all those great-looking exercise 
machines they show on TV. 

The movers were hauling stuff into my room, so I couldn’t go in there. I 



pulled open a door to what I thought was a closet. But to my surprise, I saw a 
narrow, wooden stairway. I guessed it led up to an attic. 

An attic! 

I’d never had an attic before. I’ll bet it’s filled with all kinds of great old 
stuff, I thought excitedly. Maybe the people who used to live here left their old 
comic book collection up there—and it’s worth millions! 

I was halfway up the stairs when I heard Dad’s voice behind me. “Jerry, 
where are you going?” 

“Up,” I replied. That was pretty obvious. 

“You really shouldn’t go up there by yourself,” he warned. 

“Why not? Are there ghosts up here or something?” I asked. 

I could hear his heavy footsteps on the wooden stairs. He followed me up. 
“Hot up here,” he muttered, adjusting his glasses on his nose. “It’s so stuffy.” 

He tugged on a chain suspended from the ceiling, and an overhead light 
came on, casting pale yellow light down on us. 

I glanced quickly around. It was all one room, long and low, the ceiling 
slanting down on both sides under the roof. I’m not very tall, but I reached up 
and touched the ceiling. 

There were tiny, round windows at both ends. But they were covered with 
dust and didn’t let in much light. 

“It’s empty,” I muttered, very disappointed. 

“We can store a lot of junk up here,” Dad said, looking around. 

“Hey—what’s that?” I spotted something against the far wall and began 
walking quickly toward it. The floorboards squeaked and creaked under my 
sneakers. 

I saw a gray, quilted cover over something large. Maybe it’s some kind of 
treasure chest, I thought. 

No one ever accused me of not having a good imagination. 

Dad was right behind me as I grabbed the heavy cover with both hands and 
pulled it away. 

And stared at a shiny, black piano. 

“Wow,” Dad murmured, scratching his bald spot, staring at the piano with 
surprise. “Wow. Wow. Why did they leave this behind?” 

I shrugged. “It looks like new,” I said. I hit some keys with my pointer 
finger. “Sounds good.” 

Dad hit some keys, too. “It’s a really good piano,” he said, rubbing his hand 



lightly over the keyboard. “I wonder what it’s doing hidden up here in the attic 
like this....” 

“It’s a mystery,” I agreed. 

I had no idea how big a mystery it really was. 

I couldn’t get to sleep that night. I mean, there was no way. 

I was in my good old bed from our old house. But it was facing the wrong 
direction. And it was against a different wall. And the light from the neighbor’s 
back porch was shining through the window. The window rattled from the wind. 
And all these creepy shadows were moving back and forth across the ceiling. 

I’m never going to be able to sleep in this new room, I realized. 

It’s too different. Too creepy. Too big. 

I’m going to be awake for the rest of my life! 

I just lay there, eyes wide open, staring up at the weird shadows. 

I had just started to relax and drift off to sleep when I heard the music. 

Piano music. 

At first, I thought it was coming from outside. But I quickly realized it was 
coming from up above me. From the attic! 

I sat straight up and listened. Yes. Some kind of classical music. Right over 
my head. 

I kicked off the covers and lowered my feet to the floor. 

Who could be up in the attic playing the piano in the middle of the night? I 
wondered. It couldn’t be Dad. He can’t play a note. And the only thing Mom can 
play is “Chopsticks”, and not very well. 

Maybe it’s Bonkers, I told myself. 

I stood up and listened. The music continued. Very softly. But I could hear 
it clearly. Every note. 

I started to make my way to the door and stubbed my toe against a carton 
that hadn’t been unpacked. “Ow!” I cried out, grabbing my foot and hopping 
around until the pain faded. 

Mom and Dad couldn’t hear me, I knew. Their bedroom was downstairs. 

I held my breath and listened. I could still hear the piano music above my 
head. 

Walking slowly, carefully, I stepped out of my room and into the hallway. 
The floorboards creaked under my bare feet. The floor was cold. 

I pulled open the attic door and leaned into the darkness. 



The music floated down. It was sad music, very slow, very soft. 
“Who—who’s up there?” I stammered. 



2 


The sad music continued, floating down the dark, narrow stairway to me. 

“Who’s up there?” I repeated, my voice shaking just a little. 

Again, no reply. 

I leaned into the darkness, peering up toward the attic. “Mom, is that you? 
Dad?” 

No reply. The melody was so sad, so slow. 

Before I even realized what I was doing, I was climbing the stairs. They 
groaned loudly under my bare feet. 

The air grew hot and stuffy as I reached the top of the stairs and stepped 
into the dark attic. 

The piano music surrounded me now. The notes seemed to be coming from 
all directions at once. 

“Who is it?” I demanded in a shrill, high-pitched voice. I guess I was a little 
scared. “Who’s up here?” 

Something brushed against my face, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. 

It took me a long, shuddering moment to realize it was the light chain. 

I pulled it. Pale yellow light spread out over the long, narrow room. 

The music stopped. 

“Who’s up here?” I called, squinting toward the piano against the far wall. 

No one. 

No one there. No one sitting at the piano. 

Silence. 

Except for the floorboards creaking under my feet as I walked over to the 
piano. I stared at it, stared at the keys. 

I don’t know what I expected to see. I mean, someone was playing the 
piano. Someone played it until the exact second the light went on. Where did 
they go? 

I ducked down and searched under the piano. 

I know it was stupid, but I wasn’t thinking clearly. My heart was pounding 
really hard, and all kinds of crazy thoughts were spinning through my brain. 

I leaned over the piano and examined the keyboard. I thought maybe this 



was one of those old-fashioned pianos that played by itself. A player piano. You 
know, like you sometimes see in cartoons. 

But it looked like an ordinary piano. I didn’t see anything special about it. 

I sat down on the bench. 

And jumped up. 

The piano bench was warm! As if someone had just been sitting on it! 
“Whoa!” I cried aloud, staring at the shiny, black bench. 

I reached down and felt it. It was definitely warm. 

But I reminded myself the whole attic was really warm, much warmer than 
the rest of the house. The heat seemed to float up here and stay. 

I sat back down and waited for my racing heart to return to normal. 

What’s going on here? I asked myself, turning to stare at the piano. The 
black wood was polished so well, I could see the reflection of my face staring 
back at me. 

My reflection looked pretty scared. 

I lowered my eyes to the keyboard and then hit a few soft notes. 

Someone had been playing this piano a few moments ago, I knew. 

But how could they have vanished into thin air without me seeing them? 

I plunked another note, then another. The sound echoed through the long, 
empty room. 

Then I heard a loud creak. From the bottom of the stairs. 

I froze, my hand still on the piano keys. 

Another creak. A footstep. 

I stood up, surprised to find my legs all trembly. 

I listened. I listened so hard, I could hear the air move. 

Another footstep. Louder. Closer. 

Someone was on the stairs. Someone was climbing to the attic. 

Someone was coming for me. 



3 


Creak. Creak. 

The stairs gave way beneath heavy footsteps. 

My breath caught in my throat. I felt as if I would suffocate. 

Frozen in front of the piano, I searched for a place to hide. But of course 
there wasn’t any. 

Creak. Creak. 

And then, as I stared in terror, a head poked up above the stairwell. 

“Dad!” I cried. 

“Jerry, what on earth are you doing up here?” He stepped into the pale 
yellow light. His thinning brown hair was standing up all over his head. His 
pajama pants were twisted. One leg had rolled up to the knee. He squinted at me. 
He didn’t have his glasses on. 

“Dad—I—I thought—” I sputtered. I knew I sounded like a complete jerk. 
But give me a break—I was scared ! 

“Do you know what time it is?” Dad demanded angrily. He glanced down at 
his wrist, but he wasn’t wearing his watch. “It’s the middle of the night, Jerry!” 

“I—I know, Dad,” I said, starting to feel a little better. I walked over to him. 
“I heard piano music, see. And so I thought—” 

“You what?” His dark eyes grew wide: His mouth dropped open. “You 
heard what?” 

“Piano music,” I repeated. “Up here. So I came upstairs to check it out, and 

“Jerry!” Dad exploded. His face got really red. “It’s too late for your dumb 
jokes!” 

“But, Dad—” I started to protest. 

“Your mother and I killed ourselves unpacking and moving furniture all 
day,” Dad said, sighing wearily. “We’re both exhausted, Jerry. I shouldn’t have 
to tell you that I’m in no mood for jokes. I have to go to work tomorrow 
morning. I need some sleep.” 

“Sorry, Dad,” I said quietly. I could see there was no way I was going to get 
him to believe me about the piano music. 

“I know you’re excited about being in a new house,” Dad said, putting a 



hand on the shoulder of my pajama shirt. “But, come on. Back to your room. 
You need your sleep, too.” 

I glanced back at the piano. It glimmered darkly in the pale yellow light. As 
if it were breathing. As if it were alive. 

I pictured it rumbling toward me, chasing me to the stairs. 

Crazy, weird thoughts. I guess I was more tired than I thought! 

“Would you like to learn to play it?” Dad asked suddenly. 

“Huh?” His question caught me by surprise. 

“Would you like to take piano lessons? We could have the piano brought 
downstairs. There’s room for it in the family room.” 

“Well... maybe,” I replied. “Yeah. That might be neat.” 

He took his hand from my shoulder. Then he straightened his pajama 
bottoms and started down the stairs. “I’ll discuss it with your mother,” he said. 
“I’m sure she’ll be pleased. She always wanted someone to be musical in the 
family. Pull the light chain, okay?” 

Obediently, I reached up and clicked off the light. The sudden darkness was 
so black, it startled me. I stayed close behind my dad as we made our way down 
the creaking stairs. 

Back in my bed, I pulled the covers up to my chin. It was kind of cold in 
my room. Outside, the winter wind gusted hard. The bedroom window rattled 
and shook, as if it were shivering. 

Piano lessons might be fun, I thought. If they let me learn to play rock 
piano, not that drippy, boring classical stuff. 

After a few lessons, maybe I could get a synthesizer. Get two or three 
different keyboards. Hook them up to a computer. 

Then I could do some composing. Maybe get a group together. 

Yeah. It could be really excellent. 

I closed my eyes. 

The window rattled again. The old house seemed to groan. 

I’ll get used to these noises, I told myself. I’ll get used to this old house. 
After a few nights, I won’t even hear the noises. 

I had just about drifted off to sleep when I heard the soft, sad piano music 
begin again.

Monday morning, I woke up very early. My cat clock with the moving tail and 
eyes wasn’t unpacked yet. But I could tell it was early by the pale gray light 
coming through my bedroom window. 

I got dressed quickly, pulling on a clean pair of faded jeans and a dark green 
pullover shirt that wasn’t too wrinkled. It was my first day at my new school, so 
I was pretty excited. 

I spent more time on my hair than I usually do. My hair is brown and thick 
and wiry, and it takes me a long time to slick it down and make it lie flat the way 
I like it. 

When I finally got it right, I made my way down the hall to the front stairs. 
The house was still silent and dark. 

I stopped outside the attic door. It was wide open. 

Hadn’t I closed it when I’d come downstairs with my dad? 

Yes. I remembered shutting it tight. And now, here it was, wide open. 

I felt a cold chill on the back on my neck. I closed the door, listening for the 
click. 

Jerry, take it easy, I warned myself. Maybe the latch is loose. Maybe the 
attic door always swings open. It’s an old house, remember? 

I’d been thinking about the piano music. Maybe it was the wind blowing 
through the piano strings, I told myself. 

Maybe there was a hole or something in the attic window. And the wind 
blew in and made it sound as if the piano were playing. 

I wanted to believe it had been the wind that made that slow, sad music. I 
wanted to believe it, so I did. 

I checked the attic door one more time, making sure it was latched, then 
headed down to the kitchen. 

Mom and Dad were still in their room. I could hear them getting dressed. 

The kitchen was dark and a little cold. I wanted to turn up the furnace, but I 
didn’t know where the thermostat was. 

Not all of our kitchen stuff had been unpacked. Cartons were still stacked 
against the wall, filled with glasses and plates and stuff. 

I heard someone coming down the hall. 



A big, empty carton beside the refrigerator gave me an idea. Snickering to 
myself, I jumped inside it and pulled the lid over me. 

I held my breath and waited. 

Footsteps in the kitchen. I couldn’t tell if it was Mom or Dad. 

My heart was pounding. I continued to hold my breath. If I didn’t, I knew I 
would burst out laughing. 

The footsteps went right past my carton to the sink. I heard water running. 
Whoever it was filled the kettle. 

Footsteps to the stove. 

I couldn’t wait anymore. 

“SURPRISE!” I screamed and jumped to my feet in the carton. 

Dad let out a startled shriek and dropped the kettle. It landed on his foot 
with a thud, then tilted onto its side on the floor. 

Water puddled around Dad’s feet. The kettle rolled toward the stove. Dad 
was howling and holding his injured foot and hopping up and down. 

I was laughing like a maniac! You should’ve seen the look on Dad’s face 
when I jumped up from the carton. I really thought he was going to drop his 
teeth! 

Mom came bursting into the room, still buttoning her sleeve cuffs. “What’s 
going on in here?” she cried. 

“Just Jerry and his stupid jokes,” Dad grumbled. 

“Jerome!” Mom shouted, seeing all the spilled water on the linoleum. “Give 
us a break.” 

“Just trying to help wake you up,” I said, grinning. They complain a lot, but 
they’re used to my twisted sense of humor. 

I heard the piano music again that night. 

It was definitely not the wind. I recognized the same sad melody. 

I listened for a few moments. It came from right above my room. 

Who’s up there? Who can be playing? I asked myself. 

I started to climb out of bed and investigate. But it was cold in my room, 
and I was really tired from my first day at the new school. 

So I pulled the covers over my head to drown out the piano music, and 
quickly fell asleep. 

“Did you hear the piano music last night?” I asked my mom. 

“Eat your cornflakes,” she replied. She tightened the belt of her bathrobe 



and leaned toward me over the kitchen table. 

“How come I have to have cornflakes?” I grumbled, mushing the spoon 
around in the bowl. 

“You know the rules,” she said, frowning. “Junk cereal only on weekends.” 

“Stupid rule,” I muttered. “I think cornflakes is a junk cereal.” 

“Don’t give me a hard time,” Mom complained, rubbing her temples. “I 
have a headache this morning.” 

“From the piano playing last night?” I asked. 

“What piano playing?” she demanded irritably. “Why do you keep talking 
about piano playing?” 

“Didn’t you hear it? The piano in the attic? Someone was playing it last 
night.” 

She jumped to her feet. “Oh, Jerry, please. No jokes this morning, okay? I 
told you I have a headache.” 

“Did I hear you talking about the piano?” Dad came into the kitchen, 
carrying the morning newspaper. “The guys are coming this afternoon to carry it 
down to the family room.” He smiled at me. “Limber up those fingers, Jerry.” 

Mom had walked over to the counter to pour herself a cup of coffee. “Are 
you really interested in this piano?” she demanded, eyeing me skeptically. “Are 
you really going to practice and work at it?” 

“Of course,” I replied. “Maybe.” 


* * * 


The two piano movers were there when I got home from school. They weren’t 
very big, but they were strong. 

I went up to the attic and watched them while Mom pulled cartons out of 
the family room to make a place for it. 

The two men used ropes and a special kind of dolly. They tilted the piano 
onto its side, then hoisted it onto the dolly. 

Lowering it down the narrow staircase was really hard. It bumped against 
the wall several times, even though they moved slowly and carefully. 

Both movers were really red-faced and sweaty by the time they got the 
piano downstairs. I followed them as they rolled it across the living room, then 
through the dining room. 

Mom came out of the kitchen, her hands jammed into her jeans pockets, 



and watched from the doorway as they rolled the dolly with the piano into the 
family room. 

The men strained to tilt it right side up. The black, polished wood really 
glowed in the bright afternoon sunlight through the family room windows. 

Then, as they started to lower the piano to the floor, Mom opened her 
mouth and started to scream.

“The cat! The cat!” Mom shrieked, her face all twisted in alarm. 

Sure enough, Bonkers was standing right in the spot where they were 
lowering the piano. 

The piano thudded heavily to the floor. Bonkers ran out from under it just in 

time. 

Too bad! I thought, shaking my head. That dumb cat almost got what it 
deserved. 

The men were apologizing as they tried to catch their breath, mopping their 
foreheads with their red-and-white bandannas. 

Mom ran to Bonkers and picked her up. “My poor little kitty.” 

Of course Bonkers swiped at Mom’s arm, her claws tearing out several 
threads in the sweater sleeve. Mom dropped her to the floor, and the creature 
slithered quickly out of the room. 

“She’s a little freaked out being in a new house,” Mom told the two 
workers. 

“She always acts like that,” I told them. 

A few minutes later, the movers were gone. Mom was in her room, trying to 
fix her sweater. And I was alone in the family room with my piano. 

I sat on the bench and slid back and forth on it. The bench was polished and 
smooth. It was real slippery. 

I planned a really funny comedy act where I sit down to play the piano for 
Mom and Dad, only the bench is so slippery, I keep sliding right onto the floor. 

I practiced sliding and falling for a while. I was having fun. 

Falling is one of my hobbies. It isn’t as easy as it looks. 

After a while, I got tired of falling. I just sat on the bench and stared at the 
keys. I tried picking out a song, hitting notes until I found the right ones. 

I started to get excited about learning to play the piano. 

I imagined it was going to be fun. 

I was wrong. Very wrong. 

Saturday afternoon, I stood staring out the living room window. It was a blustery, 
gray day. It looked like it was about to snow. 



I saw the piano teacher walking up the driveway. He was right on time. Two 
o’clock. 

Pressing my face against the window, I could see that he was big, kind of 
fat. He wore a long, puffy red coat and he had bushy white hair. From this 
distance, he sort of looked like Santa Claus. 

He walked very stiffly, as if his knees weren’t good. Arthritis or something, 
I guessed. 

Dad had found his name in a tiny ad in the back of the New Goshen 
newspaper. He showed it to me. It said: 

THE SHREEK SCHOOL 
New Method Piano Training 

Since it was the only ad in the paper for a piano teacher, Dad called it. 

And now, Mom and Dad were greeting the teacher at the door and taking 
his heavy red coat. “Jerry, this is Dr. Shreek,” Dad said, motioning for me to 
leave my place by the window. 

Dr. Shreek smiled at me. “Hello, Jerry.” 

He really did look like Santa Claus, except he had a white mustache, no 
beard. He had round, red cheeks and a friendly smile, and his blue eyes sort of 
twinkled as he greeted me. 

He wore a white shirt that was coming untucked around his big belly, and 
baggy, gray pants. 

I stepped forward and shook hands with him. His hand was red and kind of 
spongy. “Nice to meet you, Dr. Shreek,” I said politely. 

Mom and Dad grinned at each other. They could never believe it when I 
was polite! 

Dr. Shreek put his spongy hand on my shoulder. “I know I have a funny 
name,” he said, chuckling. “I probably should change it. But, you have to admit, 
it’s a real attention-getter!” 

We all laughed. 

Dr. Shreek’s expression turned serious. “Have you ever played an 
instrument before, Jerry?” 

I thought hard. “Well, I had a kazoo once!” 

Everyone laughed again. 

“The piano is a little more difficult than the kazoo,” Dr. Shreek said, still 



chuckling. “Let me see your piano.” 

I led him through the dining room and into the family room. He walked 
stiffly, but it didn’t seem to slow him down. 

Mom and Dad excused themselves and disappeared upstairs to do more 
unpacking. 

Dr. Shreek studied the piano keys. Then he lifted the back and examined the 
strings with his eyes. “Very fine instrument,” he murmured. “Very fine.” 

“We found it here,” I told him. 

His mouth opened in a little O of surprise. “You found it?” 

“In the attic. Someone just left it up there,” I said. 

“How strange,” he replied, rubbing his pudgy chin. He straightened his 
white mustache as he stared at the keys. “Don’t you wonder who played this 
piano before you?” he asked softly. “Don’t you wonder whose fingers touched 
these keys?” 

“Well...” I really didn’t know what to say. 

“What a mystery,” he said in a whisper. Then he motioned for me to take a 
seat on the piano bench. 

I was tempted to do my comedy act and slide right off onto the floor. But I 
decided I’d save it for when I knew him better. 

He seemed like a nice, jolly kind of guy. But I didn’t want him to think I 
wasn’t serious about learning to play. 

He dropped down beside me on the bench. He was so wide, there was 
barely room for the two of us. 

“Will you be giving me lessons here at home every week?” I asked, 
scooting over as far as I could to make room. 

“I’ll give you lessons at home at first,” he replied, his blue eyes twinkling at 
me. “Then, if you show promise, Jerry, you can come to my school.” 

I started to say something, but he grabbed my hands. 

“Let me take a look,” he said, raising my hands close to his face. He turned 
them over and studied both sides. Then he carefully examined my fingers. 

“What beautiful hands!” he exclaimed breathlessly. “Excellent hands!” 

I stared down at my hands. They didn’t look like anything special to me. 
Just normal hands. 

“Excellent hands,” Dr. Shreek repeated. He placed them carefully on the 
piano keys. He showed me what each note was, starting with C, and he had me 
play each one with the correct finger. 



“Next week we will start,” he told me, climbing up from the piano bench. “I 
just wanted to meet you today.” 

He searched through a small bag he had leaned against the wall. He pulled 
out a workbook and handed it to me. It was called Beginning to Play: A Hands- 
On Approach. 

“Look this over, Jerry. Try to learn the notes on pages two and three.” He 
made his way over to his coat, which Dad had draped over the back of the couch. 

“See you next Saturday,” I said. I felt a little disappointed that the lesson 
had been so short. I thought I’d be playing some great rock riffs by now. 

He pulled on his coat, then came back to where I was sitting. “I think you 
will be an excellent student, Jerry,” he said, smiling. 

I muttered thanks. I was surprised to see that his eyes had settled on my 
hands. “Excellent. Excellent,” he whispered. 

I felt a sudden chill. 

I think it was the hungry expression on his face. 

What’s so special about my hands? I wondered. Why does he like them so 
much? 

It was weird. Definitely weird. 

But of course I didn’t know how weird....

CDEFGABC. 

I practiced the notes on pages two and three of the piano workbook. The 
book showed which finger to use and everything. 

This is easy, I thought. 

So when can I start playing some rock and roll? 

I was still picking out notes when Mom surfaced from the basement and 
poked her head into the family room. Her hair had come loose from the 
bandanna she had tied around her head, and she had dirt smudges on her 
forehead. 

“Did Dr. Shreek leave already?” she asked, surprised. 

“Yeah. He said he just wanted to meet me,” I told her. “He’s coming back 
next Saturday. He said I had excellent hands.” 

“You do?” She brushed the hair out of her eyes. “Well, maybe you can take 
those excellent hands down to the basement and use them to help us unpack 
some boxes.” 

“Oh, no!” I cried, and I slid off the piano bench and fell to the floor. 

She didn’t laugh. 

That night, I heard piano music. 

I sat straight up in bed and listened. The music floated up from downstairs. 

I climbed out of bed. The floorboards were cold under my bare feet. I was 
supposed to have a carpet, but Dad hadn’t had time to put it down yet. 

The house was silent. Through my bedroom window, I could see a gentle 
snow coming down, tiny, fine flakes, gray against the black sky. 

“Someone is playing the piano,” I said aloud, startled by the huskiness of 
my sleep-filled voice. 

“Someone is downstairs playing my piano.” 

Mom and Dad must hear it, I thought. Their room is at the far end of the 
house. But they are downstairs. They must hear it. 

I crept to my bedroom door. 

The same slow, sad melody. I had been humming it just before dinner. Mom 
had asked me where I’d heard it, and I couldn’t remember. 



I leaned against the doorframe, my heart pounding, and listened. The music 
drifted up so clearly, I could hear each note. 

Who is playing? 

Who? 

I had to find out. Trailing my hand along the wall, I hurried through the 
dark hallway. There was a night-light by the stairway, but I was always 
forgetting to turn it on. 

I made my way to the stairs. Then, gripping the wooden banister tightly, I 
crept down, one step at a time, trying to be silent. 

Trying not to scare the piano player away. 

The wooden stairs creaked quietly under my weight. But the music 
continued. Soft and sad, almost mournful. 

Tiptoeing and holding my breath, I crossed the living room. A streetlight 
cast a wash of pale yellow across the floor. Through the large front window, I 
could see the tiny snowflakes drifting down. 

I nearly tripped over an unpacked carton of vases left next to the coffee 
table. But I grabbed the back of the couch and kept myself from falling. 

The music stopped. Then started again. 

I leaned against the couch, waiting for my heart to stop pounding so hard. 

Where are Mom and Dad? I wondered, staring toward the back hallway 
where their room was. 

Can’t they hear the piano, too? Aren’t they curious? Don’t they wonder 
who is in the family room in the middle of the night, playing such a sad song? 

I took a deep breath and pushed myself away from the couch. Slowly, 
silently, I made my way through the dining room. 

It was darker back there. No light from the street. I moved carefully, aware 
of all the chairs and table legs that could trip me up. 

The door to the family room stood just a few feet ahead of me. The music 
grew louder. 

I took a step. Then another. 

I moved into the open doorway. 

Who is it? Who is it? 

I peered into the darkness. 

But before I could see, someone uttered a horrifying shriek behind me—and 
shoved me hard, pushing me down to the floor.

I hit the floor hard on my knees and elbows. 

Another loud shriek—right in my ears. 

My shoulders throbbed with pain. 

The lights came on. 

“Bonkers!” I roared. 

The cat leapt off my shoulders and scurried out of the room. 

“Jerry—what are you doing? What’s going on?” Mom demanded angrily as 
she ran into the room. 

“What’s all the racket?” Dad was right behind her, squinting hard without 
his glasses. 

“Bonkers jumped on me!” I screamed, still on the floor. “Ow. My shoulder. 
That stupid cat!” 

“But, Jerry—” Mom started. She bent to help pull me up. 

“That stupid cat!” I fumed. “She jumped down from that shelf. She scared 
me to death. And look—look at my pajama shirt!” 

The cat’s claws had ripped right through the shoulder. 

“Are you cut? Are you bleeding?” Mom asked, pulling the shirt collar down 
to examine my shoulder. 

“We really have to do something about that cat,” Dad muttered. “Jerry is 
right. She’s a menace.” 

Mom immediately jumped to Bonkers’ defense. “She was just frightened, 
that’s all. She probably thought Jerry was a burglar.” 

“A burglar?” I shrieked in a voice so high, only dogs could hear me. “How 
could she think I was a burglar? Aren’t cats supposed to see in the dark?” 

“Well, what were you doing down here, Jerry?” Mom asked, straightening 
my pajama shirt collar. She patted my shoulder. As if that would help. 

“Yeah. Why were you skulking around down here?” Dad demanded, 
squinting hard at me. He could barely see a thing without his glasses. 

“I wasn’t skulking around,” I replied angrily. “I heard piano music and—” 

“You what?” Mom interrupted. 

“I heard piano music. In the family room. So I came down to see who was 



playing.” 

My parents were both staring at me as if I were a Martian. 

“Didn’t you hear it?” I cried. 

They shook their heads. 

I turned to the piano. No one there. Of course. 

I hurried over to the piano bench, leaned down, and rubbed my hand over 
the surface. 

It was warm. 

“Someone was sitting here. I can tell!” I exclaimed. 

“Not funny,” Mom said, making a face. 

“Not funny, Jerry,” Dad echoed. “You came down here to pull some kind of 
joke—didn’t you!” he accused. 

“Huh? Me?” 

“Don’t play innocent, Jerome,” Mom said, rolling her eyes. “We know you. 
You’re never innocent.” 

“I wasn’t playing a joke!” I cried angrily. “I heard music, someone playing 

“Who?” Dad demanded. “Who was playing?” 

“Maybe it was Bonkers,” Mom joked. 

Dad laughed, but I didn’t. 

“What was the joke, Jerry? What were you planning to do?” Dad asked. 

“Were you going to do something to the piano?” Mom demanded, staring at 
me so hard, I could practically feel it. “That’s a valuable instrument, you know.” 

I sighed wearily. I felt so frustrated, I wanted to shout, scream, throw a fit, 
and maybe slug them both. “The piano is haunted !” I shouted. The words just 
popped into my head. 

“Huh?” It was Dad’s turn to give me a hard stare. 

“It must be haunted!” I insisted, my voice shaking. “It keeps playing—but 
there’s no one playing it!” 

“I’ve heard enough,” Mom muttered, shaking her head. “I’m going back to 
bed.” 

“Ghosts, huh?” Dad asked, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. He stepped up to 
me and lowered his head, the way he does when he’s about to unload something 
serious. “Listen, Jerry, I know this house might seem old and kind of scary. And 
I know how hard it was for you to leave your friends behind and move away.” 

“Dad, please—” I interrupted. 



But he kept going. “The house is just old, Jerry. Old and a little rundown. 
But that doesn’t mean it’s haunted. These ghosts of yours—don’t you see?— 
they’re really your fears coming out.” 

Dad was a psychology major in college. 

“Skip the lecture, Dad,” I told him. “I’m going to bed.” 

“Okay, Jer,” he said, patting my shoulder. “Remember—in a few weeks, 
you’ll know I’m right. In a few weeks, this ghost business will all seem silly to 
you.” 

Boy, was he wrong! 


* * * 


I slammed my locker shut and started to pull on my jacket. The long school 
hallway echoed with laughing voices, slamming lockers, calls and shouts. 

The halls were always noisier on Friday afternoons. School was over, and 
the weekend was here! 

“Oooh, what’s that smell?” I cried, making a disgusted face. 

Beside me, a girl was down on her knees, pawing through a pile of junk on 
the floor of her locker. “I wondered where that apple disappeared to!” she 
exclaimed. 

She climbed to her feet, holding a shriveled, brown apple in one hand. The 
sour aroma invaded my nostrils. I thought I was going to hurl! 

I must have been making a funny face, because she burst out laughing. 
“Hungry?” She pushed the disgusting thing in my face. 

“No thanks.” I pushed it back toward her. “You can have it.” 

She laughed again. She was kind of pretty. She had long, straight black hair 
and green eyes. 

She set the rotten apple down on the floor. “You’re the new kid, right?” she 
asked. “I’m Kim. Kim Li Chin.” 

“Hi,” I said. I told her my name. “You’re in my math class. And science 
class,” I told her. 

She turned back to her locker, searching for more stuff. “I know,” she 
replied. “I saw you fall out of your chair when Ms. Klein called on you.” 

“I just did that to be funny,” I explained quickly. “I didn’t really fall.” 

“I know,” she said. She pulled a heavy gray wool sweater down over her 
lighter sweater. Then she reached down and removed a black violin case from 



her locker. 

“Is that your lunchbox?” I joked. 

Tm late for my violin lesson,” she answered, slamming her locker shut. 
She struggled to push the padlock closed. 

“I’m taking piano lessons,” I told her. “Well, I mean I just started.” 

“You know, I live across the street from you,” she said, adjusting her 
backpack over her shoulder. “I watched you move in.” 

“Really?” I replied, surprised. “Well, maybe you could come over and we 
could play together. I mean, play music. You know. I’m taking lessons every 
Saturday with Dr. Shreek.” 

Her mouth dropped open in horror as she stared at me. “You’re doing 
what?” she cried. 

“Taking piano lessons with Dr. Shreek,” I repeated. 

“Oh!” She uttered a soft cry, spun around, and began running toward the 
front door. 

“Hey, Kim—” I called after her. “Kim—what’s wrong?” 

But she disappeared out the door.

“Excellent hands. Excellent!” Dr. Shreek declared. 

“Thanks,” I replied awkwardly. 

I was seated at the piano bench, hunched over the piano, my hands spread 
over the keys. Dr. Shreek stood beside me, staring down at my hands. 

“Now play the piece again,” he instructed, raising his blue eyes to mine. His 
smile faded beneath his white mustache as his expression turned serious. “Play it 
carefully, my boy. Slowly and carefully. Concentrate on your fingers. Each 
finger is alive, remember—a/zve!” 

“My fingers are alive,” I repeated, staring down at them. 

What a weird thought, I told myself. 

I began to play, concentrating on the notes on the music sheet propped 
above the keyboard. It was a simple melody, a beginner’s piece by Bach. 

I thought it sounded pretty good. 

“The fingers! The fingers!” Dr. Shreek cried. He leaned down toward the 
keyboard, bringing his face close to mine. “Remember, the fingers are alive!” 

What’s with this guy and fingers? I asked myself. 

I finished the piece. I glanced up to see a frown darken his face. 

“Pretty good, Jerry,” he said softly. “Now let us try it a bit faster.” 

“I goofed up the middle part,” I confessed. 

“You lost your concentration,” he replied. He reached down and spread my 
fingers over the keys. “Again,” he instructed. “But faster. And concentrate. 
Concentrate on your hands.” 

I took a deep breath and began the piece again. But this time I messed it up 
immediately. 

I started over. It sounded pretty good. Only a few clunkers. 

I wondered if Mom and Dad could hear it. Then I remembered they had 
gone grocery shopping. 

Dr. Shreek and I were alone in the house. 

I finished the piece and lowered my hands to my lap with a sigh. 

“Not bad. Now faster,” Dr. Shreek ordered. 

“Maybe we should try another piece,” I suggested. “This is getting kind of 



boring.” 

“Faster this time,” he replied, totally ignoring me. “The hands, Jerry. 
Remember the hands. They’re alive. Let them breathe!” 

Let them breathe? 

I stared down at my hands, expecting them to talk back to me! 

“Begin,” Dr. Shreek instructed sternly, leaning over me. “Faster.” 

Sighing, I began to play again. The same boring tune. 

“Faster!” the instructor cried. “Faster, Jerry!” 

I played faster. My fingers moved over the keys, pounding them hard. I 
tried to concentrate on the notes, but I was playing too fast for my eyes to keep 
up. 

“Faster!” Dr. Shreek cried excitedly, staring down at the keyboard. “That’s 
it! Faster, Jerry!” 

My fingers were moving so fast, they were a blur! 

“Faster! Faster!” 

Was I playing the right notes? I couldn’t tell. It was too fast, too fast to 
hear! 

“Faster, Jerry!” Dr. Shreek instructed, screaming at the top of his lungs. 
“Faster! The hands are alive! Alive!” 

“I can’t do it!” I cried. “Please—!” 

“Faster! Faster!” 

“I can’t!” I insisted. It was too fast. Too fast to play. Too fast to hear. 

I tried to stop. 

But my hands kept going! 

“Stop! Stop!” I screamed down at them in horror. 

“Faster! Play faster!” Dr. Shreek ordered, his eyes wide with excitement, 
his face bright red. “The hands are a/zve!” 

“No—please! Stop!” I called down to my hands. “Stop playing!” 

But they really were alive. They wouldn’t stop. 

My fingers flew over the keys. A crazy tidal wave of notes flooded the 
family room. 

“Faster! Faster!” the instructor ordered. 

And despite my frightened cries to stop, my hands gleefully obeyed him, 
playing on, faster and faster and faster.

Faster and faster, the music swirled around me. 

It’s choking me, I thought, gasping for breath. I can’t breathe. 

I struggled to stop my hands. But they moved frantically over the keyboard, 
playing louder. Louder. 

My hands began to ache. They throbbed with pain. 

But still they played. Faster. Louder. 

Until I woke up. 

I sat up in bed, wide awake. 

And realized I was sitting on my hands. 

They both tingled painfully. Pins and needles. My hands had fallen asleep. 

I had been asleep. The weird piano lesson—it was a dream. 

A strange nightmare. 

“It’s still Friday night,” I said aloud. The sound of my voice helped bring 
me out of the dream. 

I shook my hands, trying to get the circulation going, trying to stop the 
uncomfortable tingling. 

My forehead was sweating, a cold sweat. My entire body felt clammy. The 
pajama shirt stuck damply to my back. I shuddered, suddenly chilled. 

And realized the piano music hadn’t stopped. 

I gasped and gripped the bedcovers tightly. Holding my breath, I listened. 

The notes floated into my dark bedroom. 

Not the frantic roar of notes from my dream. The slow, sad melody I had 
heard before. 

Still trembling from my frightening dream, I climbed silently out of bed. 

The music floated up from the family room, so soft, so mournful. 

Who is playing down there? 

My hands still tingled as I made my way over the cold floorboards to the 
doorway. I stopped in the hall and listened. 

The tune ended, then began again. 

Tonight I am going to solve this mystery, I told myself. 

My heart was pounding. My entire body was tingling now. Pins and needles 



up and down my back. 

Ignoring how frightened I felt, I walked quickly down the hall to the 
stairway. The dim night-light down near the floor made my shadow rise up on 
the wall. 

It startled me for a moment. I hung back. But then I hurried down the stairs, 
leaning hard on the banister to keep the steps from creaking. 

The piano music grew louder as I crossed the dark living room. 

Nothing is going to stop me tonight, I told myself. Nothing. 

Tonight I am going to see who is playing the piano. 

The music continued, soft high notes, so light and sad. 

I tiptoed carefully through the dining room, holding my breath, listening to 
the music. 

I stepped up to the doorway to the family room. 

The music continued, a little louder. 

The same melody, over and over. 

Peering into the darkness, I stepped into the room. 

One step. Another. 

The piano was only a few feet in front of me. 

The music was so clear, so close. 

But I couldn’t see anyone on the piano bench. I couldn’t see anyone there at 
all. 

Who is playing? Who is playing this sad, sad music in the darkness? 

Trembling all over, I took another step closer. Another step. 

“Who—who’s there?” I called out in a choked whisper. 

I stopped, my hands knotted tensely into tight fists at my sides. I stared hard 
into the blackness, straining to see. 

The music continued. I could hear fingers on the keys, hear the slide of feet 
on the pedals. 

“Who’s there? Who’s playing?” My voice was tiny and shrill. 

There’s no one here, I realized to my horror. 

The piano is playing, but there’s no one here. 

Then, slowly, very slowly, like a gray cloud forming in the night sky, the 
ghost began to appear. 



10 


At first I could just see faint outlines, pale lines of gray moving against the 
blackness. 

I gasped. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought it would burst. 

The gray lines took shape, began to fill in. 

I stood frozen in terror, too frightened to run or even look away. 

And as I stared, a woman came into view. I couldn’t tell if she was young or 
old. She had her head down and her eyes closed, and was concentrating on the 
piano keys. 

She had long, wavy hair hanging loose down to her shoulders. She wore a 
short-sleeved top and a long skirt. Her face, her skin, her hair—all gray. 
Everything was gray. 

She continued to play as if I weren’t standing there. 

Her eyes were closed. Her lips formed a sad smile. 

She was kind of pretty, I realized. 

But she was a ghost. A ghost playing the piano in our family room. 

“Who are you? What are you doing here?” My high-pitched, tight voice 
startled me. The words came flying out, almost beyond my control. 

She stopped playing and opened her eyes. She stared hard at me, studying 
me. Her smile faded quickly. Her face revealed no emotion at all. 

I stared back, into the gray. It was like looking at someone in a heavy, dark 

fog. 

With the music stopped, the house had become so quiet, so terrifyingly 
quiet. “Who—who are you?” I repeated, stammering in my tiny voice. 

Her gray eyes narrowed in sadness. “This is my house,” she said. Her voice 
was a dry whisper, as dry as dead leaves. As dry as death. 

“This is my house.” The whispered words seemed to come from far away, 
so soft I wasn’t sure I had heard them. 

“I—don’t understand,” I choked out, feeling a cold chill at the back of my 
neck. “What are you doing here?” 

“My house,” came the whispered reply. “My piano.” 

“But who are you?” I repeated. “Are you a ghost?” 

As I uttered my frightened question, she let out a loud sigh. And as I stared 



into the grayness, I saw her face begin to change. 

The eyes closed, and her cheeks began to droop. Her gray skin appeared to 
fall, to melt away. It drooped like cookie batter, like soft clay. It fell onto her 
shoulders, then tumbled to the floor. Her hair followed, falling off in thick 
clumps. 

A silent cry escaped my lips as her skull was revealed. Her gray skull. 

Nothing remained of her face except for her eyes, her gray eyes, which 
bulged in the open sockets, staring at me through the darkness. 

“Stay away from my piano!” she rasped. “I’m warning you—STAY AWAY! ” 

I backed up and turned away from the hideous, rasping skull. I tried to 
scramble away, but my legs didn’t cooperate. 

I fell. 

Hit the floor on my knees. 

I struggled to pull myself up, but I was shaking too hard. 

“Stay away from my piano!” The gray skull glared at me with its bulging 

eyes. 

“Mom! Dad!” I tried to scream, but it came out a muffled whisper. 

I scrambled to my feet, my heart pounding, my throat closed tight with fear. 

“This is my house! My piano! STAY AWAY!” 

“Mom! Help me! Dad!” 

This time I managed to call out. “Mom—Dad—please!” 

To my relief, I heard bumping and clumping in the hall. Heavy footsteps. 

“Jerry? Jerry? Where are you?” Mom called. “Ow!” I heard her bump into 
something in the dining room. 

Dad reached the family room first. 

I grabbed him by the shoulders, then pointed. “Dad—look! A ghost! It’s a 
GHOST!” 



11 


Dad clicked on the light. Mom stumbled into the room, holding one knee. 

I pointed in horror to the piano bench. 

Which was now empty. 

“The ghost—I saw her!” I cried, shaking all over. I turned to my parents. 
“Did you hear her? Did you?” 

“Jerry, calm down.” Dad put his hands on my trembling shoulders. “Calm 
down. It’s okay. Everything is okay.” 

“But did you see her?” I demanded. “She was sitting there, playing the 
piano, and—” 

“Ow. I really hurt my knee,” Mom groaned. “I bumped it on the coffee 
table. Oww.” 

“Her skin dropped off. Her eyes bulged out of her skull!” I told them. I 
couldn’t get that grinning skull out of my mind. I could still see her, as if her 
picture had been burned into my eyes. 

“There’s no one there,” Dad said softly, holding onto my shoulders. “See? 
No one.” 

“Did you have a nightmare?” Mom asked, bending to massage her knee. 

“It wasn’t a nightmare!” I screamed. “I saw her! I really did! She talked to 
me. She told me this was her piano, her house.” 

“Let’s sit down and talk about this,” Mom suggested. “Would you like a cup 
of hot cocoa?” 

“You don’t believe me —do you?” I cried angrily. “I’m telling you the 
truth!” 

“We don’t really believe in ghosts,” Dad said quietly. He guided me to the 
red leather couch against the wall and sat down beside me. Yawning, Mom 
followed us, lowering herself onto the soft couch arm. 

“You don’t believe in ghosts, do you, Jerry?” Mom asked. 

“I do now!” I exclaimed. “Why don’t you listen to me? I heard her playing 
the piano. I came downstairs and I saw her. She was a woman. She was all gray. 
And her face fell off. And her skull showed through. And—and—” 

I saw Mom give Dad a look. 

Why wouldn’t they believe me? 



“A woman at work was telling me about a doctor,” Mom said softly, 
reaching down and taking my hand. “A nice doctor who talks with young people. 
Dr. Frye, I think his name was.” 

“Huh? You mean a psychiatrist?” I cried shrilly. “You think I’m crazy?” 

“No, of course not,” Mom replied quickly, still holding on to my hand. “I 
think something has made you very nervous, Jerry. And I don’t think it would 
hurt to talk to someone about it.” 

“What are you nervous about, Jer?” Dad asked, straightening the collar of 
his pajama shirt. “Is it the new house? Going to a new school?” 

“Is it the piano lessons?” Mom asked. “Are you worried about the lessons?” 
She glanced at the piano, gleaming black and shiny under the ceiling light. 

“No. I’m not worried about the lessons,” I muttered unhappily. “I told you 
—I’m worried about the ghost\” 

“I’m going to make you an appointment with Dr. Frye,” Mom said quietly. 
“Tell him about the ghost, Jerry. I’ll bet he can explain it all better than your 
father and I can.” 

“I’m not crazy,” I muttered. 

“Something has you upset. Something is giving you bad dreams,” Dad said. 
“This doctor will be able to explain it to you.” He yawned and stood up, 
stretching his arms above his head. “I’ve got to get some sleep.” 

“Me, too,” Mom said, letting go of my hand and climbing off the arm of the 
couch. “Do you think you can go to sleep now, Jerry?” 

I shook my head and muttered, “I don’t know.” 

“Do you want us to walk you to your room?” she asked. 

“I’m not a little baby!” I shouted. I felt angry and frustrated. I wanted to 
scream and scream until they believed me. 

“Well, good night, Jer,” Dad said. “Tomorrow’s Saturday, so you can sleep 
late.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” I muttered. 

“If you have any more bad dreams, wake us up,” Mom said. 

Dad clicked off the light. They headed down the hall to their room. 

I made my way across the living room to the front stairs. 

I was so angry, I wanted to hit something or kick something. I was really 
insulted, too. 

But as I climbed the creaking stairs in the darkness, my anger turned to fear. 

The ghost had vanished from the family room. What if she was waiting for 



me up in my room? 

What if I walked into my room and the disgusting gray skull with the 
bulging eyeballs was staring at me from my bed? 

The floorboards squeaked and groaned beneath me as I slowly made my 
way through the hall to my room. I suddenly felt cold all over. My throat 
tightened. I struggled to breathe. 

She’s in there. She’s in there waiting for me. 

I knew it. I knew she’d be there. 

And if I scream, if I cry for help, Mom and Dad will just think I’m crazy. 

What does the ghost want? 

Why does she play the piano every night? Why did she try to frighten me? 
Why did she tell me to stay away? 

The questions rolled through my mind. I couldn’t answer them. I was too 
tired, too frightened to think clearly. 

I hesitated outside my room, breathing hard. 

Then, holding onto the wall, I gathered my courage and stepped inside. 

As I moved into the darkness, the ghost rose up in front of my bed. 



12 


I uttered a choked cry and staggered back into the doorway. 

Then I realized I was staring at my covers. I must have kicked them over 
the foot of the bed during my nightmare about Dr. Shreek. They stood in a clump 
on the floor. 

My heart pounding, I crept back into the room, grabbed the blanket and 
sheet, and pulled them back onto the bed. 

Maybe I am cracking up! I thought. 

No way, I assured myself. I might be scared and frustrated and angry—but I 
saw what I saw. 

Shivering, I slid into bed and pulled the covers up to my chin. I closed my 
eyes and tried to force the picture of the ugly gray skull from my mind. 

When I finally started to drift off to sleep, I heard the piano music start 
again. 


* * * 


Dr. Shreek arrived promptly at two the next afternoon. Mom and Dad were out 
in the garage, unpacking more cartons. I took Dr. Shreek’s coat, then led him 
into the family room. 

It was a cold, blustery day outside, threatening snow. Dr. Shreek’s cheeks 
were pink from the cold. With his white hair and mustache, and round belly 
under his baggy, white shirt, he looked more like Santa Claus than ever. 

He rubbed his pudgy hands together to warm them and motioned for me to 
take a seat at the piano bench. “Such a beautiful instrument,” he said cheerily, 
running a hand over the shiny, black top of the piano. “You are a very lucky 
young man to find this waiting for you.” 

“I guess,” I replied without enthusiasm. 

I had slept till eleven, but I was still tired. And I couldn’t shake the ghost 
and her warning from my mind. 

“Have you practiced your notes?” Dr. Shreek asked, leaning against the 
piano, turning the pages of the music workbook. 

“A little,” I told him. 



“Let me see what you have learned. Here.” He began to place my fingers 
over the keys. “Remember? This is where you start.” 

I played a scale. 

“Excellent hands,” Dr. Shreek said, smiling. “Keep repeating it, please.” 

The lesson went well. He kept telling me how good I was, even though I 
was just playing notes and a simple scale. 

Maybe I do have some talent, I thought. 

I asked him when I could begin learning some rock riffs. 

He chuckled for some reason. “In due time,” he replied, staring at my 
hands. 

I heard Mom and Dad come in through the kitchen door. A few seconds 
later, Mom appeared in the family room, rubbing the arms of her sweater. “It’s 
really getting cold out there,” she said, smiling at Dr. Shreek. “I think it’s going 
to snow.” 

“It’s nice and warm in here,” he replied, returning her smile. 

“How’s the lesson going?” Mom asked him. 

“Very well,” Dr. Shreek told her, winking at me. “I think Jerry shows a lot 
of promise. I would like him to start taking his lessons at my school.” 

“That’s wonderful!” Mom exclaimed. “Do you really think he has talent?” 

“He has excellent hands,” Dr. Shreek replied. 

Something about the way he said it gave me a cold chill. 

“Do you teach rock music at your school?” I asked. 

He patted my shoulder. “We teach all kinds of music. My school is very 
large, and we have many fine instructors. We have students of all ages there. Do 
you think you could come after school on Fridays?” 

“That would be fine,” Mom said. 

Dr. Shreek crossed the room and handed my mom a card. “Here is the 
address of my school. I’m afraid it is on the other end of town.” 

“No problem,” Mom said, studying the card. “I get off work early on 
Fridays. I can drive him.” 

“That will end our lesson for today, Jerry,” Dr. Shreek said. “Practice the 
new notes. And I’ll see you Friday.” 

He followed my mom to the living room. I heard them chatting quietly, but 
I couldn’t make out what they were saying. 

I stood up and walked to the window. It had started to snow, very large 
flakes coming down really hard. The snow was already starting to stick. 



Staring into the back yard, I wondered if there were any good hills to sled 
on in New Goshen. And I wondered if my sled had been unpacked. 

I cried out when the piano suddenly started to play. 

Loud, jangling noise. Like someone pounding furiously on the keys with 
heavy fists. 

Pound. Pound. Pound. 

“Jerry—stop it!” Mom shouted from the living room. 

“I’m not doing it!” I cried. 



13 


Dr. Frye’s office wasn’t the way I pictured a psychiatrist’s office. It was small 
and bright. The walls were yellow, and there were colorful pictures of parrots 
and toucans and other birds hanging all around. 

He didn’t have a black leather couch like psychiatrists always have on TV 
and in the movies. Instead, he had two soft-looking, green armchairs. He didn’t 
even have a desk. Just the two chairs. 

I sat in one, and he sat in the other. 

He was a lot younger than I thought he’d be. He looked younger than my 
dad. He had wavy red hair, slicked down with some kind of gel or something, I 
think. And he had a face full of freckles. 

He just didn’t look like a psychiatrist at all. 

“Tell me about your new house,” he said. He had his legs crossed. He rested 
his long notepad on them as he studied me. 

“It’s a big, old house,” I told him. “That’s about it.” 

He asked me to describe my room, so I did. 

Then we talked about the house we moved from and my old room. Then we 
talked about my friends back home. Then we talked about my new school. 

I felt nervous when we started. But he seemed okay. He listened carefully to 
everything I said. And he didn’t give me funny looks, like I was crazy or 
something. 

Even when I told him about the ghost. 

He scribbled down a few notes when I told him about the piano playing late 
at night. He stopped writing when I told him how I’d seen the ghost, and how 
her hair fell off and then her face, and how she had screamed at me to stay away. 

“My parents didn’t believe me,” I said, squeezing the soft arms of the chair. 
My hands were sweating. 

“It’s a pretty weird story,” Dr. Frye replied. “If you were your mom or dad, 
and your kid told you that story, would you believe it?” 

“Sure,” I said. “If it was true.” 

He chewed on his pencil eraser and stared at me. 

“Do you think I’m crazy?” I asked. 

He lowered his notepad. He didn’t smile at the question. “No. I don’t think 



you’re crazy, Jerry. But the human mind can be really strange sometimes.” 

Then he launched into this long lecture about how sometimes we’re afraid 
of something, but we don’t admit to ourselves that we’re afraid. So our mind 
does all kinds of things to show that we’re afraid, even though we keep telling 
ourselves that we’re not afraid. 

In other words, he didn’t believe me, either. 

“Moving to a new house creates all kinds of stress,” he said. “It is possible 
to start imagining that we see things, that we hear things—just so we don’t admit 
to ourselves what we’re really afraid of.” 

“I didn’t imagine the piano music,” I said. “I can hum the melody for you. 
And I didn’t imagine the ghost. I can tell you just what she looked like.” 

“Let’s talk about it next week,” he said, climbing to his feet. “Our time is 
up. But until next time, I just want to assure you that your mind is perfectly 
normal. You’re not crazy, Jerry. You shouldn’t think that for a second.” 

He shook my hand. “You’ll see,” he said, opening the door for me. “You’ll 
be amazed at what we figure out is behind that ghost of yours.” 

I muttered thanks and walked out of his office. 

I made my way through the empty waiting room and stepped into the 
hallway. 

And then I felt the ghost’s icy grip tighten around my neck. 



14 


The unearthly cold shot through my entire body. 

Uttering a terrified cry, I jerked away and spun around to face her. 

“Mom!” I cried, my voice shrill and tiny. 

“Sorry my hands are so cold,” she replied calmly, unaware of how badly 
she had scared me. “It’s freezing out. Didn’t you hear me calling you?” 

“No,” I told her. My neck still tingled. I tried to rub the cold away. “I... 
uh... was thinking about stuff, and—” 

“Well, I didn’t mean to scare you,” she said, leading the way across the 
small parking lot to the car. She stopped to pull the car keys from her bag. “Did 
you and Dr. Frye have a nice talk?” 

“Kind of,” I said. 

This ghost has me jumping out of my skin, I realized as I climbed into the 
car. Now I’m seeing the ghost everywhere. 

I have got to calm down, I told myself. I’ve just got to. 

I’ve got to stop thinking that the ghost is following me. 

But how? 

Friday after school, Mom drove me to Dr. Shreek’s music school. It was a cold, 
gray day. I stared at my breath steaming up the passenger window as we drove. It 
had snowed the day before, and the roads were still icy and slick. 

“I hope we’re not late,” Mom fretted. We stopped for a light. She cleared 
the windshield in front of her with the back of her gloved hand. “I’m afraid to 
drive any faster than this.” 

All of the cars were inching along. We drove past a bunch of kids building a 
snow fort in a front yard. One little red-faced kid was crying because the others 
wouldn’t let him join them. 

“The school is practically in the next town,” Mom remarked, pumping the 
brakes as we slid toward an intersection. “I wonder why Dr. Shreek has his 
school so far away from everything.” 

“I don’t know,” I answered dully. I was kind of nervous. “Do you think Dr. 
Shreek will be my instructor? Or do you think I’ll have someone else?” 

Mom shrugged her shoulders. She leaned forward over the steering wheel, 



struggling to see through the steamed-up windshield. 

Finally, we turned onto the street where the school was located. I stared out 
at the block of dark, old houses. The houses gave way to woods, the bare trees 
tilting up under a white blanket of snow. 

On the other side of the woods stood a brick building, half-hidden behind 
tall hedges. “This must be the school,” Mom said, stopping the car in the middle 
of the street and staring up at the old building. “There’s no sign or anything. But 
it’s the only building for blocks.” 

“It’s creepy-looking,” I said. 

Squinting through the windshield, she pulled the car into a narrow gravel 
driveway, nearly hidden by the tall, snow-covered hedges. 

“Are you sure this is it?” I asked. I cleared a spot on the window with my 
hand and peered through it. The old building looked more like a prison than a 
school. It had rows of tiny windows above the ground floor, and the windows 
were all barred. Thick ivy covered the front of the building, making it appear 
even darker than it was. 

“I’m pretty sure,” Mom said, biting her lip. She lowered the window and 
stuck her head out, gazing up at the enormous, old house. 

The sound of piano music floated into the car. Notes and scales and 
melodies all mixed together. 

“Yeah. We’ve found it!” Mom declared happily. 

“Go on, Jerry. Hurry. You’re late. I’m going to go pick up something for 
dinner. I’ll be back in an hour.” 

I pushed open the car door and stepped out onto the snowy driveway. My 
boots crunched loudly as I started to jog toward the building. 

The piano music grew louder. Scales and songs jumbled together into a 
deafening rumble of noise. 

A narrow walk led up to the front stoop. The walk hadn’t been shoveled, 
and a layer of ice had formed under the snow. I slipped and nearly fell as I 
approached the entrance. 

I stopped and gazed up. It looks more like a haunted house than a music 
school, I thought with a shiver. 

Why did I have such a heavy feeling of dread? 

Just nervous, I told myself. 

Shrugging away my feeling, I turned the cold brass doorknob and pushed 
open the heavy door. It creaked open slowly. Taking a deep breath, I stepped into 



the school. 



15 


Along, narrow hall stretched before me. The hall was surprisingly dark. Coming 
in from the bright, white snow, it took my eyes a long time to adjust. 

The walls were a dark tile. My boots thudded noisily on the hard floor. 
Piano notes echoed through the hall. The music seemed to burst out from all 
directions. 

Where is Dr. Shreek’s office? I wondered. 

I made my way down the hall. The lights grew dimmer. I turned into 
another long hallway, and the piano music grew louder. 

There were dark brown doors on both sides of this corridor. The doors had 
small, round windows in them. As I continued walking, I glanced into the 
windows. 

I could see smiling instructors in each room, their heads bobbing in rhythm 
to piano music. 

Searching for the office, I passed door after door. Each room had a student 
and an instructor. 

The piano sounds became a roar, like an ocean of music crashing against 
the dark tile walls. 

Dr. Shreek really has a lot of students, I thought. There must be a hundred 
pianos playing at once! 

I turned another corner and then another. 

I suddenly realized I had completely lost my sense of direction. I had no 
idea where I was. I couldn’t find my way back to the front door if I wanted to! 

“Dr. Shreek, where are you?” I muttered to myself. My voice was drowned 
out by the booming piano music that echoed off the walls and low ceiling. 

I began to feel a little frightened. 

What if these dark halls twisted on forever? I imagined myself walking and 
walking for the rest of my life, unable to find my way out, deafened by the 
pounding piano music. 

“Jerry, stop scaring yourself,” I said aloud. 

Something caught my eye. I stopped walking and stared up at the ceiling. A 
small, black camera was perched above my head. 

It appeared to be a video camera, like the security cameras you see in banks 



and stores. 

Was someone watching me on a TV screen somewhere? 

If they were, why didn’t they come help me find the way to Dr. Shreek? 

I began to get angry. What kind of school was this? No signs. No office. No 
one to greet people. 

As I turned another corner, I heard a strange thumping sound. At first I 
thought it was just another piano in one of the practice rooms. 

The thumping grew louder, closer. I stopped in the middle of the hall and 
listened. A high-pitched whine rose up over the thumping sounds. 

Louder. Louder. 

The floor seemed to shake. 

And as I stared down the dark hall, an enormous monster turned the corner. 
Its huge, square body glowed in the dim light as if it were made of metal. Its 
rectangular head bobbed near the ceiling. 

Its feet crashed against the hard floor as it moved to attack me. Eyes on the 
sides of its head flashed an angry red. 

“No!” I cried, swallowing hard. 

It uttered its high-pitched whine in reply. Then it lowered its gleaming head 
as if preparing for battle. 

I spun away, determined to escape. 

To my shock, as I turned, I saw Dr. Shreek. 

He stood just a few yards down the hall. Dr. Shreek was watching the 
enormous creature move in on me, a pleased grin on his face. 



16 


I stopped short with a loud gasp. 

Behind me, the creature was stomping closer, blasting out its angry whine. 

Ahead of me, Dr. Shreek, his blue eyes glowing with pleasure, blocked my 
escape. 

I cried out, preparing to be caught from behind by the silvery monster. 

But it stopped. 

Silence. 

No crashing of its heavy metallic feet. No shrill whine. 

“Hello, Jerry,” Dr. Shreek said calmly, still grinning. “What are you doing 
all the way back here?” 

Breathing hard, I pointed to the monster, which stood silently, staring down 
at me. “I—I—” 

“You are admiring our floor sweeper?” Dr. Shreek asked. 

“Your what?” I managed to choke out. 

“Our floor sweeper. It is rather special,” Dr. Shreek said. He stepped past 
me and put a hand on the front of the thing. 

“It—it’s a machine?” I stammered. 

He laughed. “You didn’t think it was alive, did you?” 

I just gaped at it. I was still too freaked out to speak. 

“Mr. Toggle, our janitor, built this for us,” Dr. Shreek said, rubbing his hand 
along the square metal front of it. “It works like a dream. Mr. Toggle can build 
anything. He’s a genius, a true genius.” 

“Wh-why does it have a face?” I asked, hanging back against the wall. 
“Why does it have eyes that light up?” 

“Just Mr. Toggle’s sense of humor,” Dr. Shreek replied, chuckling. “He put 
in those cameras, too.” He pointed to the video camera perched on the ceiling. 
“Mr. Toggle is a mechanical genius. We couldn’t do a thing without him. We 
really couldn’t.” 

I took a few reluctant steps forward and admired the floor sweeper from 
closer up. “I—I couldn’t find your office,” I told Dr. Shreek. “I was wandering 
and wandering—” 

“I apologize,” he replied quickly. “Let us begin your lesson. Come.” 



I followed him as he led the way back in the direction I had come. He 
walked stiffly but rapidly. His white shirt was untucked in front of his big 
stomach. He swung his hands stiffly as he walked. 

I felt really stupid. Imagine letting myself be terrified by a floor sweeper! 

He pushed open one of the brown doors with a round window, and I 
followed him into the room. I glanced quickly around. It was a small, square 
room lighted by two rows of fluorescents on the ceiling. There was no window. 

The only furniture was a small, brown upright piano, a narrow piano bench, 
and a music stand. 

Dr. Shreek motioned for me to sit down on the piano bench, and we began 
our lesson. He stood behind me, placing my fingers carefully on the keys, even 
though I now knew how to do it myself. 

We practiced different notes. I hit C’s and D’s. Then we tried E’s and F’s. 
He showed me my first chord. Then he had me do scales over and over. 

“Excellent!” he declared near the end of the hour. “Excellent work, Jerry. 
I’m most pleased.” His Santa Claus cheeks were bright pink beneath his white 
mustache. 

I squeezed my hands together, trying to get rid of a cramp. “Are you going 
to be my teacher?” I asked. 

He nodded. “Yes, I will instruct you in the basics,” he replied. “Then when 
your hands are ready, you will be given over to one of our fine teachers.” 

“When my hands are ready?” 

What exactly did he mean by that? 

“Let us try this short piece,” he said, reaching over me to turn the page in 
the music book. “Now, this piece has only three notes. But you must pay 
attention to the quarter notes and the half notes. Do you remember how long to 
continue a half note?” 

I demonstrated on the piano. Then I tried to play the short melody. I did 
pretty well. Only a few clunkers. 

“Wonderful! Wonderful!” Dr. Shreek declared, staring at my hands as I 
played. He glanced at his watch. “I’m afraid our time is up. See you next Friday, 
Jerry. Be sure to practice what I showed you.” 

I thanked him and climbed to my feet. I was glad the lesson was over. 
Having to concentrate so hard was really tiring. Both my hands were sweating, 
and I still had a cramp in one. 

I headed to the door, then stopped. “Which way do I go?” I asked. “How do 



I get to the front?” 

Dr. Shreek was busy collecting the work sheets we had used, tucking them 
into the music book. “Just keep going left,” he said without looking up. “You 
can’t miss it.” 

I said good-bye and stepped out into the dark hallway. My ears were 
immediately attacked by the roar of piano notes. 

Aren’t the other lessons over? I wondered. 

How come they keep playing even though the hour is up? 

I glanced in both directions, making sure there were no floor sweepers 
waiting to attack. Then I turned left, as Dr. Shreek had instructed, and began to 
follow the hallway toward the front. 

As I passed door after door, I could see the smiling instructors inside each 
room, their heads moving in rhythm with the piano playing. 

Most of the students in these rooms were more advanced than me, I 
realized. They weren’t practicing notes and scales. They were playing long, 
complicated pieces. 

I turned left, then when the corridor came to an end, turned left one more 

time. 

It took me a while to realize that I was lost again. 

Had I missed a left turn somewhere? 

The dark halls with their rows of brown doors on both sides all looked 
alike. 

I turned left again. My heart began to pound. 

Why wasn’t anyone else in the hall? 

Then up ahead I saw double doors. The front exit must be through those 
doors, I decided. 

I made my way eagerly to the double doors and started to push through 
them—when powerful hands grabbed me from behind, and a gruff voice rasped 
in my ear, “No, you don’t!” 



17 


“Huh?” I uttered a startled cry. 

The hands pulled me back, then let go of my shoulders. 

The double doors swung back into place. 

I spun around to see a tall, wiry man with long, scraggly black hair and a 
stubbly black beard. He wore a yellow T-shirt under denim overalls. 

“Not that way,” he said softly. “You’re looking for the front? It’s up there.” 
He pointed to the hall to the left. 

“Oh. Sorry,” I said, breathing hard. “You... scared me.” 

The man apologized. “I’ll take you to the front,” he offered, scratching his 
stubbly cheek. “Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Mr. Toggle.” 

“Oh. Hi,” I said. “I’m Jerry Hawkins. Dr. Shreek told me about you. I—I 
saw your floor sweeper.” 

He smiled. His black eyes lit up like dark coals. “It’s a beauty, isn’t it? I 
have a few other creations like it, some even better.” 

“Dr. Shreek says you’re a mechanical genius,” I gushed. 

Mr. Toggle chuckled to himself. “Yes. I programmed him to say that!” he 
joked. We both laughed. 

“Next time you come to the school, I’ll show you some of my other 
inventions,” Mr. Toggle offered, adjusting his overall straps over his slender 
shoulders. 

“Thanks,” I replied. The front door was right up ahead. I was never so glad 
to see a door! “I’m sure I’ll catch on to the layout of this place,” I said. 

He didn’t seem to hear me. “Dr. Shreek tells me you have excellent hands,” 
he said, a strange smile forming under his stubbly black beard. “That’s what we 
look for here, Jerry. That’s what we look for.” 

Feeling kind of awkward, I thanked him. I mean, what are you supposed to 
say when someone tells you what excellent hands you’ve got? 

I pushed open the heavy front door and saw Mom waiting in the car. “Good 
night!” I called, and eagerly ran out of the school, into the snowy evening. 


* * * 



After dinner, Mom and Dad insisted that I show them what I had learned in my 
piano lesson. I really didn’t want to. I had only learned that one simple song, and 
I still hadn’t played it all the way through without goofing it up. 

But they forced me into the family room and pushed me onto the piano 
bench. “If I’m going to pay for the lessons, I want to hear what you’re learning,” 
Dad said. He sat down close to Mom on the couch, facing the back of the piano. 

“We only tried one song,” I said. “Couldn’t we wait till I learn more?” 

“Play it,” Dad ordered. 

I sighed. “I have a cramp in my hand.” 

“Come on, Jerry. Don’t make excuses,” Mom snapped impatiently. “Just 
play the song, okay? Then we won’t bug you anymore tonight.” 

“What did the school look like?” Dad asked Mom. “It’s way on the other 
side of town, isn’t it?” 

“It’s practically out of town,” Mom told him. “It’s in this very old house. 
Kind of run-down looking, actually. But Jerry told me it’s nice inside.” 

“No, I didn’t,” I interrupted. “I said it was big. I didn’t say it was nice. I got 
lost in the halls twice!” 

Dad laughed. “I see you have your mother’s sense of direction!” 

Mom gave Dad a playful shove. “Just play the piece,” she said to me. 

I found it in the music book and propped the book in front of me on the 
piano. Then I arranged my fingers on the keys and prepared to play. 

But before I hit the first note, the piano erupted with a barrage of low notes. 
It sounded as if someone was pounding on the keys with both fists. 

“Jerry—stop it,” Mom said sharply. “That’s too loud.” 

“That can’t be what you learned,” Dad added. 

I set my fingers in place and began to play. 

But my notes were drowned out by the horrible, loud banging again. 

It sounded like a little kid pounding away on the keys as hard as he could. 

“Jerry—give us a break!” Mom shouted, holding her ears. 

“But I’m not doing it!” I screamed. “It isn’t me!” 



18 


They didn’t believe me. 

Instead, they got angry. They accused me of never taking anything 
seriously, and sent me up to my room. 

I was actually glad to get out of the family room and away from that 
haunted piano. I knew who was pounding the keys and making that racket. The 
ghost was doing it. 

Why? What was she trying to prove? 

What did she plan to do to me? 

Those questions I couldn’t answer... yet. 

The next Friday afternoon, Mr. Toggle kept his promise. He greeted me at the 
door to the piano school after my mom dropped me off. He led me through the 
twisting halls to his enormous workshop. 

Mr. Toggle’s workshop was the size of an auditorium. The vast room was 
cluttered with machines and electronic equipment. 

An enormous two-headed metal creature, at least three times as tall as the 
floor sweeper that had terrified me the week before, stood in the center. It was 
surrounded by tape machines, stacks of electric motors, cases of tools and 
strange-looking parts, video equipment, a pile of bicycle wheels, several piano 
frames with no insides, animal cages, and an old car with its seats removed. 

One entire wall seemed to be a control panel. It had more than a dozen 
video screens, all on, all showing different classes going on in the school. 
Around the screens were thousands of dials and knobs, blinking red and green 
lights, speakers, and microphones. 

Beneath the control panel, on a counter that ran the length of the room, 
stood at least a dozen computers. All of them seemed to be powered up. 

“Wow!” I exclaimed. My eyes kept darting from one amazing thing to 
another. “I don’t believe this!” 

Mr. Toggle chuckled. His dark eyes lit up. “I find ways to keep busy,” he 
said. He led me to an uncluttered corner of the enormous room. “Let me show 
you some of my musical instruments.” 

He walked to a row of tall, gray metal cabinets along the far wall. He pulled 



a few items from a cabinet and came hurrying back. 

“Do you know what this is, Jerry?” He held up a shiny, brass instrument 
attached to some kind of tank. 

“A saxophone?” I guessed. 

“A very special saxophone,” he said, grinning. “See? It’s attached to this 
tank of compressed air. That means you don’t have to blow into it. You can 
concentrate on your fingering.” 

“Wow,” I said. “That’s really neat.” 

“Here. Put this on,” Mr. Toggle urged. He slipped a brown leather cap over 
my head. The cap had several thin wires flowing out the back, and it was 
attached to a small keyboard. 

“What is it?” I asked, adjusting the cap over my ears. 

“Blink your eyes,” Mr. Toggle instructed. 

I blinked my eyes, and the keyboard played a chord. I moved my eyes from 
right to left. It played another chord. I winked one eye. It played a note. 

“It’s completely eye-controlled,” Mr. Toggle said with pride. “No hands 
required.” 

“Wow,” I repeated. I didn’t know what else to say. This stuff was amazing! 

Mr. Toggle glanced up at a row of clocks on the control panel wall. “You’re 
late for class, Jerry. Dr. Shreek will be waiting. Tell him it’s my fault, okay?” 

“Okay,” I said. “Thanks for showing me everything.” 

He laughed. “I didn’t show you everything,” he joked. “There’s lots more.” 
He rubbed his stubbly beard. “But you’ll see it all in due time.” 

I thanked him again and hurried toward the door. It was nearly four-fifteen. 
I hoped Dr. Shreek wouldn’t be angry that I was fifteen minutes late. 

As I jogged across the enormous workroom, I nearly ran into a row of dark 
metal cabinets, shut and padlocked. 

Turning away from them, I suddenly heard a voice. 

“Help!” A weak cry. 

I stopped by the side of the cabinet and listened hard. 

And heard it again. A little voice, very faint. “Help me, please!” 



19 


“Mr. Toggle—what’s that?” I cried. 

He had begun fiddling with the wires on the brown leather cap. He slowly 
looked up. “What’s what?” 

“That cry,” I told him, pointing to the cabinet. “I heard a voice.” 

He frowned. “It’s just damaged equipment,” he muttered, returning his 
attention to the wires. 

“Huh? Damaged equipment?” I wasn’t sure I had heard him correctly. 

“Yeah. Just some damaged equipment,” he repeated impatiently. “You’d 
better hurry, Jerry. Dr. Shreek must be wondering where you are.” 

I heard a second cry. A voice, very weak and tiny. “Help me—please!” 

I hesitated. Mr. Toggle was staring at me impatiently. 

I had no choice. I turned and ran from the room, the weak cries still in my 

ears. 

On Saturday afternoon I went outside to shovel snow off our driveway. It had 
snowed the night before, only an inch or two. Now it was one of those clear 
winter days with a bright blue sky overhead. 

It felt good to be out in the crisp air, getting some exercise. Everything 
seemed so fresh and clean. 

I was finishing down at the bottom of the drive, my arms starting to ache 
from all the shoveling, when I saw Kim Li Chin. She was climbing out of her 
mother’s black Honda, carrying her violin case. I guessed she was coming from 
a lesson. 

I had seen her in school a few times, but I hadn’t really talked to her since 
that day she ran away from me in the hall. 

“Hey!” I called across the street, leaning on the shovel, a little out of breath. 
“Hi!” 

She handed the violin case to her mother and waved back. Then she came 
jogging toward me, her black hightops crunching over the snow. “How’s it 
going?” she asked. “Pretty snow, huh?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. Want to shovel some? I still have to do the walk.” 

She laughed. “No thanks.” She had a high, tinkly laugh, like two glasses 



clinking together. 

“You coming from a violin lesson?” I asked, still leaning on the shovel. 

“Yeah. I’m working on a Bach piece. It’s pretty hard.” 

“You’re ahead of me,” I told her. “I’m still doing mostly notes and scales.” 

Her smile faded. Her eyes grew thoughtful. 

We talked a little while about school. Then I asked if she’d like to come in 
and have some hot chocolate or something. 

“What about the walk?” she asked, pointing. “I thought you had to shovel 
it.” 

“Dad would be disappointed if I didn’t save some of it for him,” I joked. 

Mom filled two big white mugs with hot chocolate. Of course I burned my 
tongue on the first sip. 

Kim and I were sitting in the den. Kim sat on the piano bench and tapped 
some keys lightly. “It has a really good tone,” she said, her face growing serious. 
“Better than my mother’s piano.” 

“Why did you run away that afternoon?” I blurted out. 

It had been on my mind ever since it happened. I had to know the answer. 

She lowered her eyes to the piano keyboard and pretended she hadn’t heard 
me. 

So I asked again. “Why did you run away like that, Kim?” 

“I didn’t,” she replied finally, still avoiding my eyes. “I was late for a 
lesson, that’s all.” 

I set my hot chocolate mug down on the coffee table and leaned against the 
arm of the couch. “I told you I was going to take piano lessons at the Shreek 
School, remember? Then you got this strange look on your face, and you ran 
away.” 

Kim sighed. She had the white hot chocolate mug in her lap. I saw that she 
was gripping it tightly in both hands. “Jerry, I really don’t want to talk about it,” 
she said softly. “It’s too... too scary.” 

“Scary?” I asked. 

“Don’t you know the stories about the Shreek School?” she asked. 



20 


I laughed. I’m not sure why. Maybe it was the serious expression on Kim’s face. 
“Stories? What kind of stories?” 

“I really don’t want to tell you,” she said. She took a long sip from the 
white mug, then returned it to her lap. 

“I just moved here, remember?” I told her. “So I haven’t heard any stories. 
What are they about?” 

“Things about the school,” she muttered. She climbed off the piano bench 
and walked to the window, carrying the mug in one hand. 

“What kinds of things?” I demanded. “Come on, Kim —tell me!” 

“Well... things like, there are monsters there,” she replied, staring out the 
window into my snowy back yard. “Real monsters that live in the basement.” 

“Monsters?” I laughed. 

Kim spun around. “It’s not funny,” she snapped. 

“I’ve seen the monsters,” I told her, shaking my head. 

Her face filled with surprise. “You’ve what?” 

“I’ve seen the monsters,” I repeated. “They’re floor sweepers.” 

“Huh?” Her mouth dropped open. She nearly spilled hot chocolate down 
the front of her sweatshirt. “Floor sweepers?” 

“Yeah. Mr. Toggle built them. He works at the school. He’s some kind of 
mechanical genius. He builds all kinds of things.” 

“But—” she started. 

“I saw one my first day at the school,” I continued. “I thought it was some 
kind of monster. It made this weird whining sound, and it was coming right at 
me. I practically dropped my teeth! But it was one of Mr. Toggle’s floor 
cleaners.” 

Kim tilted her head, staring at me thoughtfully. “Well, you know how 
stories get started,” she said. “I knew they probably weren’t true. They probably 
all have simple explanations like that.” 

“All?” I asked. “There are more?” 

“Well...” She hesitated. “There were stories about how kids went in for 
lessons and never came out again. How they vanished, just disappeared.” 

“That’s impossible,” I said. 



“Yeah, I guess,” she quickly agreed. 

Then I remembered the tiny voice from the cabinet, calling out for help. 

It had to be some invention of Mr. Toggle’s, I told myself. It had to be. 

Damaged equipment, he said. He didn’t seem the least bit excited or upset 
about it. 

“It’s funny how scary stories get started,” Kim said, walking back to the 
piano bench. 

“Well, the piano school building is creepy and old,” I said. “It really looks 
like some kind of haunted mansion. I guess that’s probably why some of the 
stories got started.” 

“Probably,” she agreed. 

“The school isn’t haunted, but that piano is!” I told her. I don’t know what 
made me say it. I hadn’t told anyone about the ghost and the piano. I knew no 
one would believe me. 

Kim gave a little start and stared at the piano. “This piano is haunted? What 
do you mean? How do you know?” 

“Late at night, I hear someone playing it,” I told her. “A woman. I saw her 
once.” 

Kim laughed. “You’re putting me on—right?” 

I shook my head. “No, I’m serious, Kim. I saw this woman. Late at night. 
She plays the same sad melody over and over.” 

“Jerry, come on!” Kim pleaded, rolling her eyes. 

“The woman talked to me. Her skin fell off. It—it was so frightening, Kim. 
Her face disappeared. Her skull, it stared at me. And she warned me to stay 
away. Stay away.” 

I felt a shiver. Somehow I had shut that scary scene out of my mind for a 
few days. But now, as I told it to Kim, it all came back to me. 

Kim had a big grin on her face. “You’re a better storyteller than I am,” she 
said. “Do you know a lot of ghost stories?” 

“It isn’t a story! ” I cried. Suddenly, I was desperate for her to believe me. 

Kim started to reply, but my mom poked her head into the family room and 
interrupted. “Kim, your mom just called. She needs you to come home now.” 

“Guess I’d better go,” Kim said, setting down the hot chocolate mug. 

I followed her out. 

We had just reached the family room doorway when the piano began to 
play. A strange jumble of notes. 



“See?” I cried excitedly to Kim. “See? Now do you believe me?” 



21 


We both turned back to stare at the piano. 

Bonkers was strutting over the keys, his tail straight up behind him. 

Kim laughed. “Jerry, you’re funny! I almost believed you!” 

“But—but—but—” I sputtered. 

That stupid cat had made a fool of me again. 

“See you in school,” Kim said. “I loved your ghost story.” 

“Thanks,” I said weakly. Then I hurried across the room to chase Bonkers 
off the piano. 

Late that night I heard the piano playing again. 

I sat straight up in bed. The shadows on my ceiling seemed to be moving in 
time to the music. 

I had been sleeping lightly, restlessly. I must have kicked off my covers in 
my sleep, because they were bunched at the foot of the bed. 

Now, listening to the familiar slow melody, I was wide awake. 

This was not Bonkers strutting over the keys. This was the ghost. 

I stood up. The floorboards were ice-cold. Outside the bedroom window, I 
could see the winter-bare trees shivering in a strong breeze. 

As I crept to the bedroom doorway, the music grew louder. 

Should I go down there? I asked myself. 

Will the ghost disappear the minute I poke my head into the family room? 

Do I really want to see her? 

I didn’t want to see that hideous, grinning skull again. 

But I realized I couldn’t just stand there in the doorway. I couldn’t go back 
to bed. I couldn’t ignore it. 

I had to go investigate. 

I was pulled downstairs, as if tugged by an invisible rope. 

Maybe this time Mom and Dad will hear her, too, I thought as I made my 
way along the hallway. Maybe they will see her, too. Maybe they will finally 
believe me. 

Kim flashed into my mind as I started down the creaking stairs. She thought 



I was making up a ghost story. She thought I was trying to be funny. 

But there really was a ghost in my house, a ghost playing my piano. And I 
was the only one who knew it. 

Into the living room. Across the worn carpet to the dining room. 

The music floated so gently, so quietly. 

Such ghostly music, I thought.... 

I hesitated just short of the family room doorway. Would she vanish the 
instant I peeked in? 

Was she waiting for me? 

Taking a deep breath, I took a step into the family room. 



22 


She had her head down, her long hair falling over her face. 

I couldn’t see her eyes. 

The piano music seemed to swirl around me, pulling me closer despite my 

fear. 

My legs were trembling, but I took a step closer. Then another. 

She was all gray. Shades of gray against the blackness of the night sky 
through the windows. 

Her head bobbed and swayed in rhythm with the music. The sleeves of her 
blouse billowed as her arms moved over the keys. 

I couldn’t see her eyes. I couldn’t see her face. Her long hair covered her, as 
if hiding her behind a curtain. 

The music soared, so sad, so incredibly sad. 

I took a step closer. I suddenly realized I had forgotten to breathe. I let my 
breath out in a loud whoosh. 

She stopped playing. Maybe the sound of my breathing alerted her that I 
was there. 

As she raised her head, I could see her pale eyes peering out at me through 
her hair. 

I didn’t move. 

I didn’t breathe. 

I didn’t make a sound. 

“The stories are true,” she whispered. A dry whisper that seemed to come 
from far away. 

I wasn’t sure I had heard her correctly. I tried to say something, but my 
voice caught in my throat. 

No sound came out at all. 

“The stories are true,” she repeated. Her voice was only air, a hiss of air. 

I goggled at her. 

“Wh-what stories?” I finally managed to choke out. 

“The stories about the school,” she answered, her hair falling over her face. 
Then she started to raise her arms off the piano keys. “They’re true,” she 



moaned. “The stories are true.” 

She held her arms up to me. 

Gaping at them in horror, I cried out—then started to gag. 
Her arms ended in stumps. She had no hands. 



23 


The next thing I knew, my mom was wrapping her arms around me. “Jerry, calm 
down. Jerry, it’s okay. It’s okay,” she kept repeating. 

“Huh? Mom?” 

I was gasping for breath. My chest was heaving up and down. My legs were 
all wobbly. 

“Mom? Where—? How—?” 

I looked up to see my dad standing a few feet away, squinting at me through 
his glasses, his arms crossed in front of his bathrobe. “Jerry, you were screaming 
loud enough to wake the entire town!” 

I stared at him in disbelief. I hadn’t even realized I was screaming. 

“It’s okay now,” Mom said soothingly. “It’s okay, Jerry. You’re okay now.” 

I’m okay? 

Again, I pictured the ghost woman, all in gray, her hair falling down, 
forming a curtain over her face. Again, I saw her raise her arms to show me. 
Again, I saw the horrible stumps where her hands should have been. 

And again, I heard her dry whisper, “The stories are true. ” 

Why didn’t she have any hands? Why? 

How did she play the piano without hands? 

Why was she haunting my piano? Why did she want to terrify me? 

The questions circled my brain so fast, I wanted to scream and scream and 
scream. But I was all screamed out. 

“Your mom and I were both sound asleep. You scared us to death,” Dad 
said. “I never heard wails like that.” 

I didn’t remember screaming. I didn’t remember the ghost disappearing, or 
Mom and Dad rushing in. 

It was too horrifying. I guess my mind just shut off. 

“I’ll make you some hot chocolate,” Mom said, still holding me tight. “Try 
to stop trembling.” 

“I—I’m trying,” I stammered. 

“Guess it was another nightmare,” I heard Dad tell Mom. “Must have been 
a vivid one.” 



“It wasn’t a nightmare!” I shrieked. 

“Sorry,” Dad said quickly. He didn’t want to get me started again. 

But it was too late. Before I even realized it was happening, I started to 
scream. “I don’t want to play the piano! Get it out of here! Get it out!” 

“Jerry, please—” Mom pleaded, her face tight with alarm. 

But I couldn’t stop. “I don’t want to play! I don’t want lessons! I won’t go 
to that piano school! I won’t, I won’t!” 

“Okay, okay!” Dad cried, shouting to be heard over my desperate wails. 
“Okay, Jerry. No one is going to force you.” 

“Huh?” I gazed from one parent to the other, trying to see if they were 
serious. 

“If you don’t want piano lessons, you don’t have to take them,” Mom said, 
keeping her voice in a low, soothing tone. “You’re only signed up for one more 
anyway.” 

“Yeah,” Dad quickly joined in. “When you go to the school on Friday, just 
tell Dr. Shreek that it’s your last lesson.” 

“But I don’t want—” I started. 

Mom put a gentle hand over my mouth. “You have to tell Dr. Shreek, Jerry. 
You can’t just quit.” 

“Tell him on Friday,” Dad urged. “You don’t have to play the piano if you 
don’t want to. Really.” 

Mom’s eyes searched mine. “Does that make you feel better, Jerry?” 

I glanced at the piano, now silent, shimmering dully in the dim light from 
overhead. “Yeah. I guess,” I muttered uncertainly. “I guess it does.” 

Friday afternoon after school, a gray, blustery day with dark snowclouds 
hovering low overhead, Mom drove me to the piano school. She pulled into the 
long driveway between the tall hedges and stopped in front of the entrance to the 
dark, old building. 

I hesitated. “Couldn’t I just run in and tell Dr. Shreek that I quit, then run 
right back out?” 

Mom glanced at the clock on the dashboard. “Take one more lesson, Jerry. 
It won’t hurt. We’ve already paid for it.” 

I sighed unhappily. “Will you come in with me? Or can you wait out here 
for me?” 

Mom frowned. “Jerry, I’ve got three stops to make. I’ll be back in an hour, I 



promise.” 

Reluctantly, I pushed open the car door. “Bye, Mom.” 

“If Dr. Shreek asks why you’re quitting, just tell him it was interfering with 
your schoolwork.” 

“Okay. See you in an hour,” I said. I slammed the car door, then watched as 
she drove away, the tires crunching over the gravel drive. 

I turned and trudged into the school building. 

My sneakers thudded loudly as I made my way through the dark halls to Dr. 
Shreek’s room. I looked for Mr. Toggle, but didn’t see him. Maybe he was in his 
enormous workshop inventing more amazing things. 

The usual roar of piano notes poured from the practice rooms as I passed by 
them. Through the small, round windows I could see smiling instructors, their 
hands waving, keeping the beat, their heads swaying to their students’ playing. 

As I turned a corner and headed down another long, dark corridor, a strange 
thought popped into my head. I suddenly realized that I had never seen another 
student in the halls. 

I had seen instructors through the windows of the rooms. And I had heard 
the noise of their students’ playing. But I had never seen another student. 

Not one. 

I didn’t have long to think about it. A smiling Dr. Shreek greeted me outside 
the door to our practice room. “How are you today, Jerry?” 

“Okay,” I replied, following him into the room. 

He wore baggy gray pants held up with bright red suspenders over a 
rumpled white shirt. His white hair looked as if it hadn’t been brushed in a few 
days. He motioned for me to take my place on the piano bench. 

I sat down quickly, folding my hands tensely in my lap. I wanted to get my 
speech over with quickly before we began the lesson. “Uh... Dr. Shreek?” 

He walked stiffly across the small room until he was standing right in front 
of me. “Yes, my boy?” he beamed down at me, his Santa Claus cheeks bright 
pink. 

“Well... I... this will be my last lesson,” I choked out. “I’ve decided I... 
uh... have to quit.” 

His smile vanished. He grabbed my wrist. “Oh, no,” he said, lowering his 
voice to a growl. “No. You’re not leaving, Jerry.” 

“Huh?” I cried. 

He tightened his grip on my wrist. He was really hurting me. 



“Quitting?” he exclaimed. “Not with those hands.” His face twisted into an 
ugly snarl. “You can’t quit, Jerry. I need those beautiful hands.” 



24 


“Let go!” I screamed. 

He ignored me and tightened his grip, his eyes narrowing menacingly. 
“Such excellent hands,” he muttered. “Excellent.” 

“No!” 

With a shrill cry, I jerked my wrist free. I leapt up from the piano bench and 
began running to the door. 

“Come back, Jerry!” Dr. Shreek called angrily. “You cannot get away!” 

He started after me, moving stiffly but steadily, taking long strides. 

I pushed open the door and darted out into the hall. The banging of piano 
music greeted my ears. The long, dark hall was empty as always. 

“Come back, Jerry!” Dr. Shreek called from right behind me. 

“No!” I cried out again. I hesitated, trying to decide which way to go, which 
way led to the front door. Then I lowered my head and started to run. 

My sneakers thudded over the hard floor. I ran as fast as I could, faster than 
I’d ever run in my life. The practice rooms whirred past in a dark blur. 

But to my surprise, Dr. Shreek kept right behind me. “Come back, Jerry,” 
he called, not even sounding out of breath. “Come back. You cannot get away 
from me.” 

Glancing back, I saw that he was gaining on me. 

I could feel the panic rise to my throat, choking off my air. My legs ached. 
My heart pounded so hard, it felt as if my chest were about to burst. 

I turned a corner and ran down another long hall. 

Where was I? Was I heading toward the front door? 

I couldn’t tell. This dark hallway looked like all the others. 

Maybe Dr. Shreek is right. Maybe I can’t get away, I thought, feeling the 
blood throb at my temples as I turned another corner. 

I searched for Mr. Toggle. Perhaps he could save me. But the halls were 
empty. Piano music poured out of every room, but no one was out in the hall. 

“Come back, Jerry! There’s no use running!” 

“Mr. Toggle!” I screamed, my voice hoarse and breathless. “Mr. Toggle— 
help me! Help me, please!” 



I turned another corner, my sneakers sliding on the smoothly polished floor. 
I was gasping for breath now, my chest heaving. 

I saw double doors up ahead. Did they lead to the front? 

I couldn’t remember. 

With a low moan, I stuck out both hands and pushed open the doors. 

“No!” I heard Dr. Shreek shout behind me. “No, Jerry! Don’t go into the 
recital hall!” 

Too late. 

I pushed through the doors and bolted inside. Still running, I found myself 
in an enormous, brightly lit room. 

I took a few more steps—then stopped in horror. 

The piano music was deafening—like a never-ending roar of thunder. 

At first, the room was a blur. Then it slowly began to come into focus. 

I saw row after row of black pianos. Beside each piano stood a smiling 
instructor. The instructors all looked alike. They all were bobbing their heads in 
time to the music. 

The music was being played by— 

It was being played by— 

I gasped, staring from row to row. 

The music was being played by— HANDS! 

Human hands floating over the keyboards. 

No people attached. 

Just HANDS! 



25 


My eyes darted down the rows of pianos. A pair of hands floated above each 
piano. 

The instructors were all bald-headed men in gray suits with smiles plastered 
on their faces. Their heads bobbed and swayed, their gray eyes opened and 
closed as the hands played over the keyboards. 

Hands. 

Just hands. 

As I gaped, paralyzed, trying to make sense of what I saw, Dr. Shreek burst 
into the room from behind me. He made a running dive at my legs, trying to 
tackle me. 

Somehow I dodged away from his outstretched hands. 

He groaned and hit the floor on his stomach. I watched him slide across the 
smooth floor, his face red with anger. 

Then I spun around, away from the dozens of hands, away from the 
banging pianos, and started back toward the doors. 

But Dr. Shreek was faster than I imagined. To my surprise, he was on his 
feet in a second, moving quickly to block my escape. 

I skidded to a stop. 

I tried to turn around, to get away from him. But I lost my balance and fell. 

The piano music swirled around me. I looked up to see the rows of hands 
pounding away on their keyboards. 

With a frightened gasp, I struggled to my feet. 

Too late. 

Dr. Shreek was closing in on me, a gleeful smile of triumph on his red, 
round face. 



26 


“No!” I cried, and tried to climb to my feet. 

But Dr. Shreek bent over me, grabbed my left ankle, and held on. “You 
can’t get away, Jerry,” he said calmly, not even out of breath. 

“Let me go! Let me go!” I tried to twist out of his grip. But he was 
surprisingly strong. I couldn’t free myself. 

“Help me! Somebody—help me!” I cried, screaming over the roar of the 
pianos. 

“I need your hands, Jerry,” Dr. Shreek said. “Such beautiful hands.” 

“You can’t! You can’t\” I shrieked. 

The double doors burst open. 

Mr. Toggle ran in, his expression confused. His eyes darted quickly around 
the enormous room. 

“Mr. Toggle!” I cried happily. “Mr. Toggle—help me! He’s crazy ! Help 

me!” 

Mr. Toggle’s mouth dropped open in surprise. “Don’t worry, Jerry!” he 
called. 

“Help me! Hurry!” I screamed. 

“Don’t worry!” he repeated. 

“Jerry, you can’t get away!” Dr. Shreek cried, holding me down on the 
floor. 

Struggling to free myself, I watched Mr. Toggle run to the far wall. He 
pulled open a gray metal door, revealing some kind of control panel. 

“Don’t worry!” he called to me. 

I saw him pull a switch on the control panel. 

Instantly, Dr. Shreek’s hand loosened. 

I pulled my leg free and scrambled to my feet, panting hard. 

Dr. Shreek slumped into a heap. His hands drooped lifelessly to his sides. 
His eyes closed. His head sank, his chin lowering to his chest. 

He didn’t move. 

He ’s some kind of robot, I saw to my amazement. 

“Are you okay, Jerry?” Mr. Toggle had hurried to my side. 



I suddenly realized my entire body was trembling. The piano music roared 
inside my head. The room began to spin. 

I held my hands over my ears, trying to shut out the pounding noise. “Make 
them stop! Tell them to stop!” I cried. 

Mr. Toggle jogged back to the control panel and threw another switch. 

The music stopped. The hands froze in place over their keyboards. The 
instructors stopped bobbing their heads. 

“Robots. All robots,” I murmured, still shaking. 

Mr. Toggle hurried back, his dark eyes studying me. “You’re okay?” 

“Dr. Shreek—he’s a robot,” I uttered in a trembling whisper. If only I could 
get my knees to stop shaking! 

“Yes, he’s my best creation,” Mr. Toggle declared, smiling. He placed a 
hand on Dr. Shreek’s still shoulder. “He’s really lifelike, isn’t he?” 

“They—they’re all robots,” I whispered, motioning to the instructors, 
frozen beside their pianos. 

Mr. Toggle nodded. “Primitive ones,” he said, still leaning on Dr. Shreek. 
“They’re not as advanced as my buddy Dr. Shreek here.” 

“You—made them all?” I asked. 

Mr. Toggle nodded, smiling. “Every one of them.” 

I couldn’t stop shaking. I was starting to feel really sick. “Thanks for 
stopping him. I guess Dr. Shreek was out of control or something. I—I’ve got to 
go now,” I said weakly. I started walking toward the double doors, forcing my 
trembling knees to cooperate. 

“Not just yet,” Mr. Toggle said, placing a gentle hand on my shoulder. 

“Huh?” I turned to face him. 

“You can’t leave just yet,” he said, his smile fading. “I need your hands, 

see.” 

“What?” 

He pointed to a piano against the wall. A gray-suited instructor stood 
lifelessly beside it, a smile frozen on his face. There were no hands suspended 
over the keyboard. 

“That will be your piano, Jerry,” Mr. Toggle said. 



27 


I started backing toward the double doors one step at a time. “Wh-why?” I 
stammered. “Why do you need my hands?” 

“Human hands are too hard to build, too complicated, too many parts,” Mr. 
Toggle replied. He scratched his black, stubbly beard with one hand as he moved 
toward me. 

“But—” I started, taking another step back. 

“I can make the hands play beautifully,” Mr. Toggle explained, his eyes 
locked on mine. “I’ve designed computer programs to make them play more 
beautifully than any live human can play. But I can’t build hands. The students 
must supply the hands.” 

“But why?” I demanded. “Why are you doing this?” 

“To make beautiful music, naturally,” Mr. Toggle replied, taking another 
step closer. “I love beautiful music, Jerry. And music is so much more beautiful, 
so much more perfect, when human mistakes don’t get in the way.” 

He took another step toward me. Then another. “You understand, don’t 
you?” His dark eyes burned into mine. 

“No!” I screamed. “No, I don’t understand! You can’t have my hands! You 
can’t!” 

I took another step back. My legs were still trembling. 

If I can just get through those doors, I thought, maybe I have a chance. 
Maybe I can outrun him. Maybe I can get out of this crazy building. 

It was my only hope. 

Gathering my strength, ignoring the pounding of my heart, I turned. 

I darted toward the doors. 

“Ohh!” I cried out as the ghost woman appeared in front of me. 

The woman from my house, from my piano. 

She rose up, all in gray except for her eyes. Her eyes glowed red as fire. 
Her mouth was twisted in an ugly snarl of rage. She floated toward me, blocking 
my path to the door. 

I’m trapped, I realized. 

Trapped between Mr. Toggle and the ghost. 

There’s no escape now. 



28 


“I warned you!” the ghost woman wailed, her red eyes glowing with fury. “I 
warned you!” 

“No, please—” I managed to cry in a choked voice. I raised my hands in 
front of me, trying to shield myself from her. “Please—let me go!” 

To my surprise, she floated right past me. 

She was glaring at Mr. Toggle, I realized. 

He staggered back, his face tight with terror. 

The ghost woman raised her arms. “Awaken!” she wailed. “Awaken!” 

And as she waved her arms, I saw a fluttering at the pianos. The fluttering 
became a mist. Wisps of gray cloud rose up from each piano. 

I backed up to the doors, my eyes wide with disbelief. 

At each piano, the dark mist took shape. 

They were ghosts, I realized. 

Ghosts of boys, girls, men, and women. 

I watched, frozen in horror, as they rose up and claimed their hands. They 
moved their fingers, testing their hands. 

And then, with arms outstretched, their hands fluttering in front of them, the 
ghosts floated away from their pianos, moving in rows, in single file, toward Mr. 
Toggle. 

“No! Get away! Get away!” Mr. Toggle shrieked. 

He turned and tried to flee through the doors. But I blocked his path. 

And the ghosts swarmed over him. 

Their hands pulled him down. Their hands pressed him to the floor. 

He kicked and struggled and screamed. 

“Let me up! Get off me! Get off!” 

But the hands, dozens and dozens of hands, flattened over him, held him 
down, pushed him facedown on the floor. 

The gray ghost woman turned to me. “I tried to warn you!” she called over 
Mr. Toggle’s frantic screams. “I tried to scare you away! I lived in your house. I 
was a victim of this school! I tried to frighten you from becoming a victim, too!” 

“I—I—” 



“Run!” she ordered. “Hurry—call for help!” 

But I was frozen in place, too shocked by what I was seeing to move. 


* * * 


As I stared in disbelief, the ghostly hands swarmed over Mr. Toggle and lifted 
him off the floor. He squirmed and struggled, but he couldn’t free himself from 
their powerful grasp. 

They carried him to the door and then out. I followed to the doorway to 
watch. 

Mr. Toggle appeared to be floating, floating into the deep woods beside the 
school. The hands carried him away. He disappeared into the tangled trees. 

I knew he’d never be seen again. 

I spun around to thank the ghost woman for trying to warn me. 

But she was gone, too. 

I was all alone now. 

The hall stretched behind me in eerie silence. Ghostly silence. 

The piano music had ended... forever. 

A few weeks later, my life had pretty much returned to normal. 

Dad put an ad in the newspaper and sold the piano right away to a family 
across town. It left a space in the family room, so Mom and Dad got a big-screen 
TV! 

I never saw the ghost woman again. Maybe she moved out with the piano. I 
don’t know. 

I made some good friends and was starting to get used to my new school. I 
was thinking seriously of trying out for the baseball team. 

I’m not a great hitter, but I’m good in the field. 

Everyone says I have great hands. 




THE WEREWOLF 
OF FEVER SWAMP 
Goosebumps - 14 
R.L. Stine 


1 


We moved to Florida during Christmas vacation. A week later, I heard the 
frightening howls in the swamp for the first time. 

Night after night, the howls made me sit up in bed. I would hold my 
breath and wrap my arms around myself to keep from shivering. 

I would stare out my bedroom window at the chalk-colored full moon. 
And I would listen. 

What kind of creature makes such a cry? I would ask myself. 

And how close is it? Why does it sound as if it’s right outside my 
window? 

The wails rose and fell like police car sirens. They weren’t sad or 
mournful. They were menacing. 

Angry. 

They sounded to me like a warning. Stay out of the swamp. You do not 
belong here. 

When my family first moved to Florida, to our new house at the edge 
of the swamp, I couldn’t wait to explore. I stood in the back yard with the 
binoculars my dad had given me for my twelfth birthday and gazed toward 
the swamp. 

Trees with slender, white trunks tilted over each other. Their flat, broad 
leaves appeared to form a roof, covering the swamp floor in blue shadow. 

Behind me, the deer paced uneasily in their wire-mesh pen. I could 
hear them pawing the soft, sandy ground, mbbing their antlers against the 
walls of their pen. 

Lowering my binoculars, I turned to look at them. The deer were the 
reason we had moved to Florida. 

You see, my dad, Michael F. Tucker, is a scientist. He works for the 
University of Vermont in Burlington, which, believe me, is a long way from 
the Florida swamps! 

Dad got these six deer from some country in South America. They’re 
called swamp deer. They’re not like regular deer. I mean, they don’t look 
like Bambi. For one thing, their fur is very red, not brown. And their hooves 
are really big and kind of webbed. For walking on wet, swampy ground, I 



guess. 

Dad wants to see if these South American swamp deer can survive in 
Florida. He plans to put little radio transmitters on them, and set them free 
in the swamp. Then he’ll study how they get along. 

When he told us back in Burlington that we were moving to Florida 
because of the deer, we all totally freaked. We didn’t want to move. 

My sister, Emily, cried for days. She’s sixteen, and she didn’t want to 
miss her senior year in high school. I didn’t want to leave my friends, either. 

But Dad quickly got Mom on his side. Mom is a scientist, too. She and 
Dad work together on a lot of projects. So, of course, she agreed with him. 

And the two of them tried to persuade Emily and me that this was the 
chance of a lifetime, that it was going to be really exciting. An adventure 
we’d never forget. 

So here we were, living in a little white house in a neighborhood of 
four or five other little white houses. We had six weird-looking red deer 
penned up behind the house. The hot Florida sun was beaming down. And 
an endless swamp stretched beyond our flat, grassy back yard. 

I turned away from the deer and raised the binoculars to my face. 
“Oh,” I cried out as two dark eyes seemed to be staring back at me. 

I pulled the binoculars away and squinted toward the swamp. In the 
near distance I saw a large white bird on two long, spindly legs. 

“It’s a crane,” Emily said. I hadn’t realized Emily had stepped up 
beside me. She was wearing a sleeveless white T-shirt and short red denim 
shorts. My sister is tall and thin and very blonde. She looks a lot like a 
crane. 

The bird turned and began high-stepping toward the swamp. 

“Let’s follow it,” I said. 

Emily made her pouting face, an expression we’d all seen a lot of since 
moving down here. “No way. It’s too hot.” 

“Aw, come on.” I tugged her skinny arm. “Let’s do some exploring, 
check out the swamp.” 

She shook her head, her white-blonde ponytail swinging behind her. “I 
really don’t want to, Grady.” She adjusted her sunglasses on her nose. “I’m 
kind of waiting for the mail.” 

Since we’re so far from the nearest post office, we only get mail two 
times a week. Emily had been spending most of her time waiting for the 



mail. 

“Waiting for a love letter from Martin?” I asked with a grin. She hated 
when I teased her about Martin, her boyfriend back in Burlington. So I 
teased her as often as I could. 

“Maybe,” she said. She reached out with both hands and messed up 
my hair. She knows I hate to have my hair messed up. 

“Please?” I pleaded. “Come on, Emily. Just a short walk. Very short.” 

“Emily, take a short walk with Grady,” Dad’s voice broke in. We 
turned to see him inside the deer pen. He had a clipboard in one hand and 
was going from deer to deer, taking notes. “Go ahead,” he urged my sister. 
“You’re not doing anything else.” 

“But, Dad—” Emily could whine with the best of them when she 
wanted. 

“Go ahead, Em,” Dad insisted. “It will be interesting. More interesting 
than standing around in the heat arguing with him.” 

Emily pushed the sunglasses up again. They kept slipping down her 
nose. “Well...” 

“Great!” I cried. I was really excited. I’d never been in a real swamp 
before. “Let’s go!” I grabbed my sister’s hand and pulled. 

Emily reluctantly followed, a fretful expression on her face. “I have a 
bad feeling about this,” she muttered. 

My shadow slanting behind me, I hurried toward the low, tilting trees. 
“Emily, what could go wrong?” I asked. 



2 


It was hot and wet under the trees. The air felt sticky against my face. The 
broad palm leaves were so low, I could almost reach up and touch them. 
They nearly blocked out the sun, but shafts of yellow light broke through, 
beaming down on the swamp floor like spotlights. 

Scratchy weeds and fern leaves brushed against my bare legs. I wished 
I’d worn jeans instead of shorts. I kept close to my sister as we made our 
way along a narrow, winding trail. The binoculars, strapped around my 
neck, began to feel heavy against my chest. I should’ve left them at home, I 
realized. 

“It’s so noisy here,” Emily complained, stepping over a decaying log. 

She was right. The most surprising thing about the swamp was all the 
sounds. 

A bird trilled from somewhere above. Another bird replied with a shrill 
whistle. Insects chittered loudly all around us. I heard a steady tap-tap-tap, 
like someone hammering on wood. A woodpecker? Palm leaves crackled as 
they swayed. Slender tree trunks creaked. My sandals made thup thup 
sounds, sinking into the marshy ground as I walked. 

“Hey, look,” Emily said, pointing. She pulled off her dark glasses to 
see better. 

We had come to a small, oval-shaped pond. The water was dark green, 
half-hidden in shade. Floating on top were white water lilies, bending 
gracefully over flat, green lily pads. 

“Pretty,” Emily said, brushing a bug off her shoulder. “I’m going to 
come back here with my camera and take pictures of this pond. Look at the 
great light.” 

I followed her gaze. The near end of the pond was darkened by long 
shadows. But light slanted down through the trees at the other end, forming 
what looked like a bright curtain that spilled into the still pond water. 

“It is kind of cool,” I admitted. I wasn’t really into ponds. I was more 
interested in wildlife. 

I let Emily admire the pond and the water lilies a little longer. Then I 
headed around the pond and deeper into the swamp. 



My sandals slapped over the wet ground. Up ahead, a swarm of tiny 
gnats, thousands of them, danced silently in a shaft of sunlight. 

“Yuck,” Emily muttered. “I hate gnats. It makes me itchy just to look 
at them.” She scratched her arms. 

We turned away—and both saw something scamper behind a fallen, 
moss-covered log. 

“Hey—what was that?” Emily cried, grabbing my elbow. 

“An alligator!” I shouted. “Ahungry alligator!” 

She uttered a short, frightened cry. 

I laughed. “What’s your problem, Em? It was just some kind of 
lizard.” 

She squeezed my arm hard, trying to make me flinch. “You’re a creep, 
Grady,” she muttered. She scratched her arms some more. “It’s too itchy in 
this swamp,” she complained. “Let’s head back.” 

“Just a little bit farther,” I pleaded. 

“No. Come on. I really want to get back.” She tried to pull me, but I 
backed out of her grasp. “Grady—” 

I turned and started walking away from her, deeper into the swamp. I 
heard the tap-tap-tap again, directly overhead. The low palm leaves scraped 
against each other, shifting in a soft, wet breeze. The shrill cluttering of the 
insects grew louder. 

“I’m going home and leaving you here,” Emily threatened. 

I ignored her and kept walking. I knew she was bluffing. 

My sandals crackled over dried, brown palm leaves. Without turning 
around, I could hear Emily a few steps behind me. 

Another little lizard scampered across the path, just in front of my 
sandals. It looked like a dark arrow, shooting into the underbrush. 

The ground suddenly sloped upward. We found ourselves climbing a 
low hill into bright sunlight. A clearing of some sort. 

Beads of sweat ran down my cheeks. The air was so wet, I felt as if I 
were swimming. 

At the top of the hill, we stopped to look around. “Hey—another 
pond!” I cried, running over fat, yellow swamp grass, hurrying up to the 
water’s edge. 

But this pond looked different. 

The dark green water wasn’t flat and smooth. Leaning over it, I could 



see that it was murky and thick, like split-pea soup. It made disgusting 
gurgling and plopping sounds as it churned. 

I leaned down closer to get a better look. 

“It’s quicksand!” I heard Emily cry in horror. 

And then two hands shoved me hard from behind. 



3 


As I started to fall into the bubbling green stew, the same hands grabbed my 
waist and pulled me back. 

Emily giggled. “Gotcha!” she cried, holding on to me, keeping me 
from turning around and slugging her. 

“Hey—let go!” I cried angrily. “You almost pushed me into quicksand ! 
That’s not funny!” 

She laughed some more, then let me go. “It isn’t quicksand, dork,” she 
muttered. “It’s a bog.” 

“Huh?” I turned to stare into the gloppy green water. 

“It’s a bog. A peat bog,” she repeated impatiently. “Don’t you know 
anything?” 

“What’s a peat bog?” I asked, ignoring her insults. Emily the Know-It- 
All. She’s always bragging about how she knows everything and I’m a 
stupid clod. But she gets B’s in school, and I get A’s. So who’s the smart 
one? 

“We learned about this last year when we studied the wetlands and rain 
forests,” she replied smugly. “The pond is thick because it has peat moss 
growing in it. The moss grows and grows. It absorbs twenty-five times its 
own weight in water.” 

“It’s gross-looking,” I said. 

“Why don’t you drink some and see how it tastes,” she urged. 

She tried to push me again, but I ducked and skirted away. “I’m not 
thirsty,” I muttered. I realize it wasn’t too clever, but it was the best reply I 
could think of. 

“Let’s get going,” she said, wiping sweat off her forehead with her 
hand. “I’m really hot.” 

“Yeah. Okay,” I reluctantly agreed. “This was a pretty neat walk.” 

We turned away from the peat bog and started back down the hill. 
“Hey, look!” I cried, pointing to two black shadows floating high above us 
under a white cloud. 

“Falcons,” Emily said, shielding her eyes with one hand as she gazed 
up. “I think they’re falcons. It’s hard to see. They sure are big.” 



We watched them soar out of sight. Then we continued down the hill, 
making our way carefully on the damp, sandy ground. 

At the bottom of the hill, back under the deep shade of the trees, we 
stopped to catch our breath. 

I was really sweating now. The back of my neck felt hot and itchy. I 
mbbed it with one hand, but it didn’t seem to help. 

The breeze had stopped. The air felt heavy. Nothing moved. 

Loud cawing sounds made me glance up. Two enormous blackbirds 
peered down at us from a low branch of a cypress tree. They cawed again, 
as if telling us to go away. 

“This way,” Emily said with a sigh. 

I followed her, feeling prickly and itchy all over. “I wish we had a 
swimming pool at our new house,” I said. “I’d jump right in with my 
clothes on!” 

We walked for several minutes. The trees grew thicker. The light grew 
dimmer. The path ended. We had to push our way through tall, leafy ferns. 

“I—I don’t think we’ve been here before,” I stammered. “I don’t think 
this is the right way.” 

We stared at each other, watching each other’s face fill with fright. 

We both realized we were lost. Completely lost. 



4 


“I don’t believe this!” Emily shrieked. 

Her loud shout made the two blackbirds flutter off their tree limb. 
They soared away, cawing angrily. 

“What am I doing here?” she cried. Emily is not good in emergencies. 
When she got a flat tire during one of her first driving lessons back home in 
Burlington, she jumped out of the car and ran away! 

So I didn’t exactly expect her to be calm and cool now. Since we were 
totally lost in the middle of a dark, hot swamp, I expected her to panic. And 
she did. 

I’m the calm one in the family. I take after Dad. Cool and scientific. 
“Let’s just figure out the direction of the sun,” I said, ignoring the fluttering 
in my chest. 

“What sun?” Emily cried, throwing her hands up. 

It was really dark. The palm trees with their wide leaves formed a 
pretty solid roof above us. 

“Well, we could check out some moss,” I suggested. The fluttering in 
my chest was growing stronger. “Isn’t moss supposed to grow on the north 
side of trees?” 

“East side, I think,” Emily muttered. “Or is it the west?” 

“I’m pretty sure it’s the north,” I insisted, gazing around. 

“Pretty sure? What good is pretty sure?” Emily cried shrilly. 

“Forget the moss,” I said, rolling my eyes. “I’m not even sure what 
moss looks like.” 

We stared at each other for a long time. 

“Didn’t you used to carry a compass with you wherever you went?” 
Emily asked, sounding a little shaky. 

“Yeah. When I was four,” I replied. 

“I can’t believe we were so stupid,” Emily wailed. “We should have 
worn one of the radio transmitters. You know. For the deer. Then Dad could 
track us down.” 

“I should have worn jeans,” I muttered, noticing some tiny red bumps 
along my calf. Poison ivy? Some kind of rash? 



“What should we do?” Emily asked impatiently, wiping sweat off her 
forehead with her hand. 

“Go back up the hill, I guess,” I told her. “There were no trees there. It 
was sunny. Once we see where the sun is, we can figure out the direction to 
get back.” 

“But which way is the hill?” Emily demanded. 

I spun around. Was it behind us? To our right? A cold chill ran down 
my back as I realized I wasn’t sure. 

I shrugged. “We’re really lost,” I murmured with a sigh. 

“Let’s go this way,” Emily said, starting to walk away. “I just have a 
feeling this is the way. If we come to that bog, we’ll know we’re going 
right.” 

“And if we don’t?” I demanded. 

“We’ll come to something else, maybe,” she replied. 

Brilliant. 

But I didn’t see any good in arguing with her. So I followed. 

We walked in silence, the shrill ringing of the insects on all sides, the 
calls of birds startling us from above. After a short while, we pushed our 
way through a clump of tall, stiff reeds. 

“Have we been here before?” Emily asked. 

I couldn’t remember. I pushed a reed away to step through and realized 
it had left something sticky on my hand. “Yuck!” 

“Hey, look!” Emily’s excited cry made me glance up from the sticky 
green gunk that clung to my hand. 

The bog! It was right in front of us. The same bog we had stopped at 
before. 

“Yay!” Emily cried. “I knew I was right. I just had a feeling.” 

The sight of the gurgling green pond cheered us both up. Once past it, 
we began to run. We knew we were on the right path, nearly home. 

“Way to go!” I cried happily, running past my sister. “Way to go!” 

I was feeling really good again. 

Then something reached up, grabbed my ankle, and pulled me down to 
the swampy ground. 



5 


I hit the ground hard, landing on my elbows and knees. 

My heart leapt into my mouth. 

I tasted blood. 

“Get up! Get up!” Emily was screaming. 

“It—it’s got me!” I cried in a tight, trembling voice. 

The fluttering in my chest had become a pounding. Again, I tasted 
blood. 

I raised my eyes to see Emily laughing. 

Laughing? 

“It’s just a tree root,” she said, pointing. 

I followed the direction of her finger—and instantly realized I hadn’t 
been pulled down. I had tripped over one of the many upraised tree roots 
that arched over the ground. 

I stared at the bonelike root. It was bent in the middle and looked like a 
skinny, white leg. 

But what was the blood I tasted? 

I felt my aching lip. I had bitten it when I fell. 

With a loud groan, I pulled myself to my feet. My knees ached. My lip 
throbbed. Blood trickled down my chin. 

“That was pretty clumsy,” Emily said softly. And then she added, “Are 
you okay?” She brushed some dried leaves off the back of my T-shirt. 

“Yeah, I guess,” I replied, still feeling a little shaky. “I really thought 
something had grabbed me.” I forced a laugh. 

She rested a hand on my shoulder, and we started walking again, 
slower than before, side by side. 

Slender beams of light poked down through the thick tree leaves, 
dotting the ground in front of us. It all looked unreal, like something in a 
dream. 

Some creature scampered noisily behind the tangle of low shrubs at 
our right. Emily and I didn’t even turn to try to see it. We just wanted to get 
home. 

It didn’t take us long to realize we were headed in the wrong direction. 



We stopped at the edge of a small, round clearing. Birds chattered 
noisily above us. A light breeze made the palm leaves scrape and creak. 

“What are those huge gray things?” I asked, lingering behind my 
sister. 

“Mushrooms, I think,” she replied quietly. 

“Mushrooms as big as footballs,” I murmured. 

We both saw the small shack at the same time. 

It was hidden in the shadow of two low cypress trees beyond the field 
of giant mushrooms at the other side of the clearing. 

We both gaped at it in surprise, studying it in shocked silence. We took 
a few steps toward it. Then a few more. 

The shack was tiny, built low to the ground, not much taller than me. It 
had some kind of thatched roof, made of long reeds or dried grass. The 
walls were made of layers of dried palm leaves. 

The door, built of slender tree limbs bound together, was shut tight. 
There were no windows. 

A pile of gray ashes formed a circle a few yards from the door. Signs 
of a campfire. 

I saw a pair of battered, old workboots lying at the side of the shack. 
Beside them were several empty tin cans on their sides and a plastic water 
bottle, also empty, partly crumpled. 

I turned to Emily and whispered, “Do you think someone lives here? 
In the middle of the swamp?” 

She shrugged, her features tight with fear. 

“If someone lives here, maybe he can tell us which way to go to get 
home,” I suggested. 

“Maybe,” Emily murmured. Her eyes were straight ahead on the tiny 
shack covered in blue shadow. 

We took another couple of steps closer. 

Why would someone want to live in a tiny shack like this in the middle 
of a swamp? I wondered. 

An answer flashed into my mind: Because whoever it is wants to hide 
from the world. 

“It’s a hideout,” I muttered, not realizing I was speaking out loud. “A 
criminal. A bank robber. Or a killer. He’s hiding here.” 

“Sshhh. ” Emily put a finger on my mouth to silence me, hitting the cut 



on my lip. I pulled away. 

“Anyone home?” she called. Her voice came out low and shaky, so 
low I could barely hear her. “Anyone home?” she repeated, a little more 
forcefully. 

I decided to join in. We shouted together: “Anyone home? Anyone in 
there?” 

We listened. 

No reply. 

We stepped up to the low door. 

“Anyone in there?” I called one more time. 

Then I reached for the doorknob. 



6 


Just as I was about to pull open the crude wooden door, it swung out, nearly 
hitting us both. We leapt back as a man burst out from the dark doorway of 
the hut. 

He glared at us with wild black eyes. He had long, gray-white hair, 
down past his shoulders, tied behind him in a loose ponytail. 

His face was bright red, sunburned, maybe. Or maybe red from anger. 
He stared at us with a menacing scowl, standing bent over, stooped from 
being inside the low hut. 

He wore a loose-fitting white T-shirt, dirt-stained and wrinkled, over 
heavy black trousers that bagged over his sandals. 

As he glared at us with those amazing black eyes, his mouth opened, 
revealing rows of jagged yellow teeth. 

Huddling close to my sister, I took a step back. 

I wanted to ask him who he was, why he lived in the swamp. I wanted 
to ask if he could help us find our way back home. 

A dozen questions flashed through my mind. 

But all I could utter was, “Uh... sorry.” 

Then I realized that Emily was already running away. Her ponytail 
flew behind her as she dived through the tall weeds. 

And a second later, I was running after her. My heart pounded. My 
sandals squished over the soft ground. 

“Hey, Emily—wait up! Wait up!” 

I ran over the rough carpet of dead leaves and twigs. 

As I struggled to catch up to her, I glanced behind me—and cried out 
in terror. “Emily—he’s chasing us!” 



7 


Bent low to the ground, the man from the hut moved steadily after us, 
taking long strides. His hands bobbed at his sides. He was breathing hard, 
and his mouth was open, revealing the jagged teeth. 

“Run!” Emily cried. “Run, Grady!” 

We were following a narrow path between tall weeds. The trees 
thinned out. We ran through shadow and sunlight and back into shadow. 

“Emily—wait up!” I called breathlessly. But she didn’t slow down. 

A long, narrow pond appeared to our left. Strange trees lifted up from 
the middle of the water. The slender trunks were surrounded by a thicket of 
dark roots. Mangrove trees. 

I wanted to stop and look at the eerie-looking trees. But this wasn’t the 
time for sightseeing. 

We ran along the edge of the pond, our sandals sinking into the marshy 
ground. Then, my chest heaving, my throat choked and dry, I followed 
Emily as the path curved into the trees. 

A sharp pain in my side made me cry out. I stopped running. I gasped 
for breath. 

“Hey—he’s gone,” Emily said, swallowing hard. She stopped a few 
yards ahead of me and leaned against a tree trunk. “We lost him.” 

I bent over, trying to force away the pain in my side. After a short 
while, my breathing slowed to normal. “Weird,” I said. I couldn’t think of 
anything else. 

“Yeah. Weird,” Emily agreed. She walked back to me and pulled me 
up straight. “You okay?” 

“I guess.” At least the pain had faded away. I always get a pain in my 
right side when I run a long time. This one was worse than usual. I usually 
don’t have to run for my life! 

“Come on,” Emily said. She let go of me and started walking quickly, 
following the path. 

“Hey, this looks familiar,” I said. I began to feel a little better. I started 
to jog. We passed clusters of trees and ferns that looked familiar. I could see 
our footprints in the sandy ground, going the other way. 



A short while later, our back yard came into view. “Home sweet 
home!” I cried. 

Emily and I stepped out from the low trees and began running across 
the grass toward the back of the house. 

Mom and Dad were in the back yard setting up outdoor furniture. Dad 
was lowering an umbrella into the white umbrella table. Mom was washing 
off the white lawn chairs with the garden hose. 

“Hey—welcome back,” Dad said, smiling. 

“We thought you got lost,” Mom said. 

“We did!” I cried breathlessly. 

Mom turned off the nozzle, stopping the spray of water. “You what?” 

“A man chased us!” Emily exclaimed. “A strange man with long white 
hair.” 

“He lives in a hut. In the middle of the swamp,” I added, dropping 
down into one of the lawn chairs. It was wet, but I didn’t care. 

“Huh? He chased you?” Dad’s eyes narrowed in alarm. Then he said, 
“I heard in town there’s a swamp hermit out there.” 

“Yes, he chased us!” Emily repeated. Her normally pale face was 
bright red. Her hair had come loose and fell wildly around her face. “It—it 
was scary.” 

“A guy in the hardware store told me about him,” Dad said. “Said he 
was strange, but perfectly harmless. No one knows his name.” 

“Harmless?” Emily cried. “Then why did he chase us?” 

Dad shrugged. “I’m only repeating what I heard. Evidently he’s lived 
in the swamp most of his life. By himself. He never comes to town.” 

Mom dropped the hose and walked over to Emily. She placed a hand 
on Emily’s shoulder. In the bright sunlight, they looked like sisters. They’re 
both tall and thin, with long, straight blonde hair. I look more like my dad. 
Wavy brown hair. Dark eyes. A little chunky. 

“Maybe they shouldn’t go back in the swamp by themselves,” Mom 
said, biting her lower lip fretfully. She started to gather Emily’s hair back up 
into a ponytail. 

“The hermit is supposed to be completely harmless,” Dad repeated. He 
was still struggling to lower the umbrella into the concrete base. Every time 
he lowered it, he missed the opening. 

“Here, Dad. I’ll help you.” I scooted under the table and guided the 



umbrella stem into the base. 

“Don’t worry,” Emily said. “You won’t catch me back in that swamp.” 
She scratched both shoulders. “I’m going to be itchy for the rest of my 
life!” she groaned. 

“We saw a lot of neat things,” I said, starting to feel normal again. “A 
peat bog and mangrove trees...” 

“I told you this was going to be an experience,” Dad said, arranging 
the white chairs around the table. 

“Some experience,” Emily grumbled, rolling her eyes. “I’m going in to 
take a shower. Maybe if I stay in it for an hour or so, I’ll stop itching.” 

Mom shook her head, watching Emily stomp toward the back door. 
“This is going to be a hard year for Em,” she muttered. 

Dad wiped his dirty hands on the sides of his jeans. “Come with me, 
Grady,” he said, motioning for me to follow him. “Time to feed the deer.” 

We talked more about the swamp at dinner. Dad told us stories about how 
they hunted and trapped the swamp deer that he was using for his 
experiment. 

Dad and his helpers searched the South American jungles for weeks. 
They used tranquilizer guns to capture the deer. Then they had to bring in 
helicopters to pull the deer out, and the deer were not too happy about 
flying. 

“The swamp you two were exploring this afternoon,” he said, twirling 
his spaghetti. “Know what it’s called? Fever Swamp. That’s what the local 
people call it, anyway.” 

“Why?” Emily asked. “Because it’s so hot in there?” 

Dad chewed and swallowed a mouthful of spaghetti. He had orange 
splotches of tomato sauce on both sides of his mouth. “I don’t know why 
it’s called Fever Swamp. But I’m sure we’ll find out eventually.” 

“It was probably discovered by a guy named Mr. Fever,” Mom joked. 

“I want to go home to Vermont!” Emily wailed. 

After dinner, I found myself feeling a little homesick, too. I took a tennis 
ball out to the back of the house. I thought maybe I could bounce it off the 
wall and catch it the way I had done back home. 

But the deer pen was in the way. 



I thought about my two best friends back in Burlington, Ben and 
Adam. We had lived on the same block and used to hang out after dinner. 
We’d throw a ball around or walk down to the playground and just mess 
around. 

Staring at the deer, who milled silently at one end of the pen, I realized 
I really missed my friends. I wondered what they were doing right now. 
Probably hanging out in Ben’s back yard. 

Feeling glum, I was about to go back inside and see what was on TV 
—when a hand grabbed me from behind. 

The swamp hermit! 



8 


He found me! 

The swamp hermit found me! And now he’s got me! 

Those are the thoughts that burst into my mind. 

I spun around—and uttered a startled cry when I saw that it wasn’t the 
swamp hermit. It was a boy. 

“Hi,” he said. “I thought you saw me. I didn’t mean to scare you.” He 
had a funny voice, gravelly and hoarse. 

“Oh. Uh... that’s okay,” I stammered. 

“I saw you in your yard,” he said. “I live over there.” He pointed to the 
house two doors down. “You just moved in?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. I’m Grady Tucker.” I slapped the tennis ball into my 
hand. “What’s your name?” 

“Will. Will Blake,” he said in his hoarse voice. He was about my 
height, but he was heavier, bigger somehow. His shoulders were broader. 
His neck was thicker. He reminded me of a football lineman. 

He had dark brown hair, cut very short. It stood straight up on top, like 
a flattop, and was swept back on the sides. He wore a blue-and-white- 
striped T-shirt and denim cutoffs. 

“How old are you?” he asked. 

“Twelve,” I answered. 

“Me, too,” he told me, glancing over my shoulder at the deer. “I 
thought maybe you were eleven. I mean, you look kind of young.” 

I was insulted by that remark, but I decided to ignore it. “How long 
have you lived here?” I asked, tossing the tennis ball from hand to hand. 

“A few months,” Will said. 

“Are there any other kids our age?” I asked, glancing down the row of 
six houses. 

“Yeah. One,” Will replied. “But she’s a girl. And she’s kind of weird.” 

In the distance, the sun was lowering itself behind the swamp trees. 
The sky was a dark scarlet. The air suddenly became cooler. Gazing high in 
the sky, I could see a pale moon, nearly full. 

Will headed over to the deer pen, and I followed him. He walked 



heavily, his big shoulders bobbing with each step. He poked his hand 
through the wire mesh and let a deer lick his palm. 

“Your father works for the Forest Service, too?” he asked, his eyes 
studying the deer. 

“No,” I told him. “My mom and dad are both scientists. They’re doing 
studies with these deer.” 

“Weird-looking deer,” Will said. He pulled his wet hand from the pen 
and held it up. “Yuck. Deer slime.” 

I laughed. “They’re called swamp deer,” I told him. I tossed him the 
tennis ball. We backed away from the deer pen and started to throw the ball 
back and forth. 

“Have you been in the swamp?” he asked. 

I missed the ball and had to chase it across the grass. “Yeah. This 
afternoon,” I told him. “My sister and I, we got lost.” 

He snickered. 

“Do you know why it’s called Fever Swamp?” I asked, tossing him a 
high one. 

It was getting pretty dark, harder to see. But he caught the ball one- 
handed. “Yeah. My dad told me the story,” Will said. “I think it was a 
hundred years ago. Maybe longer. Everyone in town came down with a 
strange fever.” 

“Everyone?” I asked. 

He nodded. “Everyone who had been in the swamp.” He held on to the 
ball and moved closer. “My dad said the fever lasted for weeks, sometimes 
even months. And lots of people died from it.” 

“That’s horrible,” I murmured, glancing across the back yard to the 
darkening trees at the swamp edge. 

“And those who didn’t die from the fever began acting very strange,” 
Will continued. He had small, round eyes. And as he told his story, his eyes 
gleamed. “They started talking crazy, not making any sense, just saying 
nonsense words. And they couldn’t walk very well. They’d fall down a lot 
or walk around in circles.” 

“Weird,” I said, my eyes still trained on the swamp. The sky darkened 
from scarlet to a deep purple. The nearly full moon seemed to glow 
brighter. 

“Ever since that time, they called it Fever Swamp,” Will said, finishing 



his story. He flipped the tennis ball to me. “I’d better get home.” 

“Did you ever see the swamp hermit?” I asked. 

He shook his head. “No. I heard about him, but I’ve never seen him.” 

“I did,” I told him. “My sister and I saw him this afternoon. We found 
his hut.” 

“That’s cool!” Will exclaimed. “Did you talk to him or anything?” 

“No way,” I replied. “He chased us.” 

“He did?” Will’s expression turned thoughtful. “Why?” 

“I don’t know. We were pretty scared,” I admitted. 

“I’ve got to go,” Will said. He started jogging toward his house. “Hey, 
maybe you and I can go exploring in the swamp together,” he called back. 

“Yeah. Great!” I replied. 

I felt a little cheered up. I’d made a new friend. Maybe it won’t be so 
bad living here, I thought. 

I watched Will head around the side of his house two doors down. His 
house looked almost identical to ours, except there was no deer pen in back, 
of course. 

I saw a swing set with a small slide and seesaw in his back yard. I 
wondered if he had a little brother or sister. 

I thought about Emily as I headed to the house. I knew she’d be 
jealous that I’d made a friend. Poor Emily was really sad without that goon 
Martin hanging around her. 

I never liked Martin. He always called me “Kiddo”. 

I watched one of the deer lower itself to the ground, folding its legs 
gracefully. Another deer did the same. They were settling in for the night. 

I made my way inside and joined my family in the living room. They 
were watching a show about sharks on the Discovery Channel. My parents 
love the Discovery Channel. Big surprise, huh? 

I watched for a short while. Then I began to realize I wasn’t feeling 
very well. I had a headache, a sharp throbbing at my temples. And I had 
chills. 

I told Mom. She got up and walked over to my chair. “You look a little 
flushed,” she said, studying me with concern. She placed a cool hand on my 
forehead and left it there for a few seconds. 

“Grady, I think you have a little fever,” she said. 



9 


A few nights later, I heard the strange, frightening howls for the first time. 

My fever had gone up to 101 degrees and stayed there for a day. Then 
it went away. Then it came back. 

“It’s the swamp fever!” I told my parents earlier that night. “Pretty 
soon I’m going to start acting crazy.” 

“You already act crazy,” Mom teased. She handed me a glass of 
orange juice. “Drink. Keep drinking.” 

“Drinking won’t help swamp fever,” I insisted glumly, taking the glass 
anyway. “There’s no cure for it.” 

Mom tsk-tsked. Dad continued to read his science magazine. 

I had strange dreams that night, disturbing dreams. I was back in 
Vermont, running through the snow. Something was chasing me. I thought 
maybe it was the swamp hermit. I kept running and running. I was very 
cold. I was shivering in the dream. 

I turned back to see who was chasing me. There wasn’t anyone there. 
And suddenly, I was in the swamp. I was sinking in a peat bog. It gurgled 
all around me, green and thick, making these sick sucking sounds. 

It was sucking me down. Down... 

The howls woke me up. 

I sat straight up in my bed and stared out the window at the nearly full 
moon. It floated right beyond the window, silvery and bright against the 
blue-black sky. 

Another long howl rose on the night air. 

I realized I was shaking all over. I was sweating. My pajama shirt 
stuck to my back. 

Gripping the covers with both hands, I listened hard. 

Another howl. The cry of an animal. 

From the swamp? 

The cries sounded so close. Right outside the window. Long, angry 
howls. 

I shoved down the covers and lowered my feet to the floor. I was still 
trembling, and my head throbbed as I stood up. I guessed I still had a fever. 



Another long howl. 

I made my way to the hall on shaky legs. I had to find out if my 
parents had heard the howls, too. 

Walking through the darkness, I bumped into a low table in the hall. I 
still wasn’t used to this new house. 

My feet were cold as ice, but my head felt burning hot, as if it were on 
fire. Rubbing the knee I had banged, I waited for my eyes to adjust to the 
darkness. Then I continued down the hall. 

My parents’ room was just past the kitchen in the back of the house. I 
was halfway across the kitchen when I stopped short. 

What was that sound? 

A scratching sound. 

My breath caught in my throat. I froze, my arms stiff at my sides. 

I listened. 

There it was again. 

Over the pounding of my heart, I heard it. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

Someone—or something —scratching at the kitchen door. 

Then—another howl. So close. So terrifyingly close. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

What could it be? Some kind of animal? Just outside the house? 

Some kind of swamp animal howling and scratching at the door? 

I realized I’d been holding my breath a long while. I let it out in a 
whoosh, then sucked in another breath. 

I listened hard, straining to hear over the pounding of my heart. 

The refrigerator clicked on. The loud click nearly made me jump out 
of my skin. I grabbed the countertop. My hands were as cold as my feet, 
cold and clammy. 

I listened. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

I took a step toward the kitchen door. 

One step, then I stopped. 

A shudder of fear ran down my back. 

I realized I wasn’t alone. 

Someone was there, breathing beside me in the dark kitchen. 



10 


I gasped. I was gripping the countertop so hard, my hand ached. 

“Wh-who’s there?” I whispered. 

The kitchen light flashed on. 

“Emily!” I practically shouted her name, in surprise and relief. “Emily 

“Did you hear the howls?” she asked, speaking just above a whisper. 
Her blue eyes burned into mine. 

“Yes. They woke me up,” I said. “They sound so angry.” 

“Like a cry of attack,” Emily whispered. “Why do you look so weird, 
Grady?” 

“Huh?” Her question caught me off guard. 

“Your face is all red,” she said. “And look at you—you’re all shaky.” 

“I think my fever is back,” I told her. 

“Swamp fever,” she murmured, examining me with her eyes. “Maybe 
it’s the swamp fever you were telling me about.” 

I turned to the kitchen door. “Did you hear the scratching sounds?” I 
asked. “Something was scratching on the back door.” 

“Yes,” she whispered. She stared at the door. 

We both listened. 

Silence. 

“Do you think one of the deer escaped?” she asked, taking a few steps 
toward the door, her arms crossed in front of her pink-and-white robe. 

“Do you think a deer would scratch at the door?” I asked. 

It was such a silly question, we both burst out laughing. 

“Maybe it wanted a glass of water!” Emily exclaimed, and we both 
laughed some more. Giddy laughter. Nervous laughter. 

We both cut our laughter short at the same time, and listened. 

Another howl rose up outside like a police siren. 

I saw Emily’s eyes narrow in fear. “It’s a wolf!” she cried in a hushed 
whisper. She raised a hand to her mouth. “Only a wolf makes a sound like 
that, Grady.” 



“Emily, come on—” I started to protest. 

“No. I’m right,” she insisted. “It’s a wolf howl.” 

“Em, stop,” I said, sinking onto a kitchen stool. “There are no wolves 
in the Florida swamps. You can look in the guidebooks. Or better yet, ask 
Mom and Dad. Wolves don’t live in swamps.” 

She started to argue, but a scratching at the door made her stop. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

We both heard it. We both reacted with sharp gasps. 

“What is that?” I whispered. And then, reading her expression, I 
quickly added, “Don’t say it’s a wolf.” 

“I—I don’t know,” she replied, both hands raised to her face. I 
recognized her look of panic. “Let’s get Mom and Dad.” 

I grabbed the door handle. “Let’s just take a look,” I said. 

I don’t know where my sudden courage came from. Maybe it was the 
fever. But, suddenly, I just wanted to solve the mystery. 

Who or what was scratching at the door? 

There was one good way to find out—open the door and look outside. 

“No, Grady—wait!” Emily pleaded. 

But I waved away her protests. 

Then I turned the doorknob and pulled open the kitchen door. 



11 


A gust of hot, wet air rushed in through the open door. The chirp of cicadas 
greeted my ears. 

Holding on to the door, I peered into the darkness of the back yard. 

Nothing. 

The nearly full moon, yellow as a lemon, floated high in the sky. Thin 
wisps of black clouds drifted over it. 

The cicadas stopped suddenly, and all was quiet. 

Too quiet. 

I squinted into the distance, toward the blackness of the swamp. 

Nothing moved. Nothing made a sound. 

I waited for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. The moonlight sent a 
pale glow over the grass. In the far distance, I could see the black outline of 
slanting trees where the swamp began. 

Who or what had scratched at the door? Were they hiding in the 
darkness now? 

Watching me? 

Waiting for me to close the door so they could begin their frightening 
howls again? 

“Grady—close the door.” 

I could hear my sister’s voice behind me. She sounded so frightened. 

“Grady—do you see something? Do you?” 

“No,” I told her. “Just the moon.” 

I ventured out onto the back stoop. The air was hot and steamy, like 
the air in the bathroom after you’ve taken a hot shower. 

“Grady—come back. Close the door.” Emily’s voice was shrill and 
trembly. 

I gazed toward the deer pen. I could see their shadowy forms, still and 
silent. The hot wind rustled the grass. The cicadas began chirping again. 

“Is anybody out here?” I called. I immediately felt foolish. 

There was no one out here. 

“Grady—shut the door. Now.” 



I felt Emily’s hand on my pajama sleeve. She tugged me back into the 
kitchen. I closed the door and locked it. 

My face felt wet from the damp night air. I had chills. My knees were 
shaking. 

“You look kind of sick,” Emily said. She glanced over my shoulder to 
the door. “Did you see anything?” 

“No,” I told her. “Nothing. It’s so dark in back, even with a full 
moon.” 

“What’s going on in here?” A stern voice interrupted us. Dad lumbered 
into the kitchen, adjusting the collar of the long nightshirt he always wore. 
“It’s past midnight.” He glanced from Emily to me, then back to Emily, 
looking for a clue. 

“We heard noises,” Emily said. “Howls outside.” 

“And then something was scratching on the door,” I added, trying to 
keep my knees from shaking. 

“Fever dreams,” Dad said to me. “Look at you. You’re red as a tomato. 
And you’re shaking. Let’s take your temperature. You must be burning up.” 
He started toward the bathroom to get the thermometer. 

“It wasn’t a dream,” Emily called after him. “I heard the noises, too.” 

Dad stopped in the doorway. “Did you check the deer?” 

“Yeah. They’re okay,” I said. 

“Then maybe it was just the wind. Or some creatures in the swamp. 
It’s hard to sleep in a new house. The sounds are all so new, so unfamiliar. 
But you’ll both get used to them after a while.” 

I’ll never get used to those horrible howls, I thought stubbornly. But I 
headed back to my room. 

Dad took my temperature. It was just slightly above normal. “You 
should be fine by tomorrow,” he said, smoothing my blanket over me. “No 
more wandering around tonight, okay?” 

I murmured a reply and almost instantly drifted into a restless sleep. 

Again I had strange, troubling dreams. I dreamed I was walking in the 
swamp. I heard the howls. I could see the full moon between the slender 
tree trunks of the swamp. 

I started to mn. And then suddenly I was up to my waist in a thick, 
green bog. And the howls continued, one after the other, echoing through 
the trees as I sank into the murky bog. 



When I awoke the next morning, the dream lingered in my mind. I 
wondered if the howls were real, or just part of the dream. 

Climbing out of bed, I realized I felt fine. Yellow morning sunlight 
poured in through the window. I could see a clear blue sky. The beautiful 
morning made me forget my nightmares. 

I wondered if Will was around this morning. Maybe he and I could go 
exploring in the swamp. 

I got dressed quickly, pulling on pale blue jeans and a black-and-silver 
Raiders T-shirt. (I’m not a Raiders fan. I just like their colors.) 

I gulped down a bowl of Frosted Flakes, allowed my mom to feel my 
head to make sure my fever was gone, and hurried to the back door. 

“Whoa. Hold on,” Mom called, setting down her coffee cup. “Where 
are you going so early?” 

“I want to see if Will is home,” I said. “Maybe we’ll hang out or 
something.” 

“Okay. Just don’t overdo it,” she warned. “Promise?” 

“Yeah. Promise,” I replied. 

I pulled open the kitchen door, stepped out into blinding sunlight—and 
screamed as an enormous, dark monster leapt onto my chest and heaved me 
to the ground. 



12 


“It—it’s got me!” I screamed as it pushed me to the ground and jumped on 
my chest. 

“Help! It—it’s licking my faceV 

I was so startled, it took me a long time to realize my attacker was a 

dog. 

By the time Mom and Dad came to my rescue and started to pull the 
big creature off my chest, I was laughing. “Hey—that tickles! Stop!” 

I wiped the dog spit off my face with my hands and scrambled to my 

feet. 

“Where’d you come from?” Mom asked the dog. She and Dad were 
holding on to the enormous beast. 

They both let go, and it stood wagging its tail excitedly, panting, its big 
red tongue hanging down practically to the ground. 

“He’s enormous!” Dad exclaimed. “He must be part shepherd.” 

I was still wiping the sticky saliva off my cheeks. 

“He scared me to death,” I confessed. “Didn’t you, fella?” I reached 
down and stroked the dark gray fur on the top of his head. His long tail 
started wagging faster. 

“He likes you,” Mom said. 

“He practically killed me!” I exclaimed. “Look at him. He must weigh 
more than a hundred pounds!” 

“Were you the one scratching at our door last night?” Emily appeared 
in the doorway, still in the long T-shirt she used as a nightshirt. “I think this 
clears up the mystery,” she said to me, yawning sleepily and pulling her 
blonde hair behind her shoulders with both hands. 

“I guess,” I muttered. I got down on my knees beside the big dog and 
stroked his back. He turned his head and licked my cheek again. “Yuck! 
Quit that!” I told him. 

“I wonder who he belongs to?” Mom said, staring at the dog 
thoughtfully. “Grady, check his collar. There’s probably an ID tag.” 

I reached up to the dog’s broad neck and felt around in his fur for a 
collar. “Nothing there,” I reported. 



“Maybe he’s a stray,” Emily said from inside the kitchen. “Maybe 
that’s why he was scratching the door last night.” 

“Yeah,” I said quickly. “He needs a place to live.” 

“Whoa,” Mom said, shaking her head. “I don’t think we need a dog 
right now, Grady. We just moved in, and—” 

“But I need a pet!” I insisted. “It’s so lonely here. A dog would be 
great, Mom. He could keep me company.” 

“You have the deer for pets,” Dad said, frowning. He turned to the deer 
pen. The six deer were all standing alertly at attention, staring warily at the 
dog. 

“You can’t walk a deer!” I protested. “Besides, you’re going to set the 
deer free, right?” 

“The dog probably belongs to someone,” Mom said. “You can’t just 
claim any dog that wanders by. Besides, he’s so big, Grady. He’s too big to 

“Aw, let him keep it,” Emily called from the house. 

I stared at her in shock. I couldn’t remember the last time Emily and I 
had been on the same side of a family argument. 

The discussion continued for several minutes more. Everyone agreed 
that he seemed like a sweet-tempered, gentle dog despite his huge size. And 
he certainly was affectionate. I couldn’t make him stop licking me. 

Glancing up, I saw Will come out of his house and head across the 
back lawns toward us. He was wearing a sleeveless blue T-shirt and blue 
Lycra bicycle shorts. “Hi! Look what we found!” I called. 

I introduced Will to my mom and dad. Emily had disappeared back to 
her room to get dressed. 

“Have you seen this dog before?” Dad asked Will. “Does he belong to 
someone in the neighborhood?” 

Will shook his head. “Nope. Never seen him.” He cautiously petted the 
dog’s head. 

“Where’d you come from, fella?” I asked, staring into the creature’s 
eyes. They were blue. Sky-blue. 

“He looks more like a wolf than a dog,” Will said. 

“Yeah. He really does,” I agreed. “Was that you howling like a wolf all 
last night?” I asked the dog. He tried to lick my nose, but I pulled my face 
back in time. 



I glanced up at Will. “Did you hear those howls last night? They were 
really weird.” 

“No. I didn’t hear anything,” Will replied. “I’m a very sound sleeper. 
My dad comes into my room and shouts through a megaphone to wake me 
up in the morning. Really!” 

We all laughed. 

“He really does look like a wolf,” Mom commented, staring at the 
dog’s blue eyes. 

“Wolves are skinnier,” Dad remarked. “Their snouts are narrower. He 
could be part wolf, I suppose. But it’s not very likely in this geographical 
area.” 

“Let’s call him Wolf,” I suggested enthusiastically. “It’s the perfect 
name for him.” I climbed to my feet. “Hi, Wolf,” I called to the dog. “Wolf! 
Hi, Wolf!” 

His ears perked straight up. 

“See? He likes the name!” I exclaimed. “Wolf! Wolf!” 

He barked at me, a single yip. 

“Can I keep him?” I asked. 

Mom and Dad exchanged long glances. “We’ll see,” Mom said. 

That afternoon, Will and I headed to the swamp to do some exploring. My 
nightmares about the swamp lingered in my mind. But I did my best to 
force them away. 

It was a blazing hot day. The sun burned down in a clear, cloudless 
sky. As we crossed my back yard, I hoped it would be cooler in the leafy 
shade of the swamp. 

I glanced back at Wolf. He was napping in the hot sunlight on his side, 
his four legs stretched straight out in front of him. 

We had fed him before lunch, some leftover roast beef scraps from our 
dinner the night before. He gobbled it up hungrily. Then, after slurping up 
an entire bowl of water, he dropped down in the grass in front of the back 
stoop to take his nap. 

Will and I followed the dirt path into the slanting trees. Black-and- 
orange monarch butterflies, four or five of them, fluttered over a bank of 
tall wildflowers. 

“Hey!” I cried out as my foot sank into a marshy spot in the dirt. When 



I pulled my sneaker out, it was covered with wet sand. 

“Have you seen the bog?” Will asked. “It’s kind of neat.” 

“Yeah. Let’s go there,” I said enthusiastically. “We can throw sticks in 
and stuff, and watch them sink.” 

“Do you think any people ever got sunk in the bog?” Will asked 
thoughtfully. He brushed a mosquito off his broad forehead, then scratched 
his short, dark brown hair. 

“Maybe,” I replied, following him as he turned off the path and headed 
through a wide patch of tall reeds. “Do you think it would really suck you 
down into it, like quicksand?” 

“My dad says there’s no such thing as quicksand,” Will said. 

“I bet there is,” I told him. “I bet people have fallen into the bog 
accidentally and gotten sucked down. If we brought a fishing rod, we could 
cast a line in and pull up their bones.” 

“Gross,” he said. 

We were walking over a carpet of dead brown leaves. Our sneakers 
crunched noisily as we made our way under tangled palm trees toward the 
bog. 

Suddenly, Will stopped. “Ssshhh. ” He raised a finger to his lips. 

I heard it, too. 

Crunching behind us. 

Footsteps. 

We both froze in place, listening hard. The footsteps drew closer. 

Will’s dark eyes narrowed in fear. “Someone’s following us,” he 
murmured. “It’s the swamp hermit!” 



13 


“Quick—hide!” I cried. 

Will dived behind a thick clump of tall weeds. I tried to follow him, 
but there wasn’t room for both of us. 

Crawling on my hands and knees, I searched frantically for something 
to hide behind. 

The crackling of dead leaves became louder. The footsteps hurried 
closer. 

I scrambled toward a nest of brambles. No. They wouldn’t hide me. 

A clump of ferns across from me was too low. 

The footsteps crackled closer. 

Closer. 

“Hide! Hide!” Will urged. 

But I was trapped out in the open. Caught. 

I struggled to my feet just as our pursuer came into view. 

“Wolf!” I cried. 

The big dog’s tail began wagging furiously as soon as he saw me. He 
uttered a joyful bark—and jumped. 

“No!” I managed to cry. 

His front paws landed hard on my chest. I stumbled backwards into the 
tall weeds and fell onto Will. 

“Hey!” He cried out and scrambled to his feet. 

Wolf barked happily and practically smothered me, trying to lick my 

face. 

“Wolf—down! Down!” I shouted. I stood up and started brushing dead 
leaves off my T-shirt. “Wolf, you’ve got to stop doing that, boy,” I told him. 
“You’re not a little puppy, you know?” 

“How did he find us?” Will asked, pulling a burr off the seat of his 
blue Lycra shorts. 

“Good nose, I guess,” I replied, staring down at the happily panting 
dog. “Maybe he’s part hunting dog or something.” 

“Let’s get to the bog,” Will said impatiently. He began leading the 



way, but Wolf pushed past him, nearly bumping him over, and continued 
trotting toward the bog, his powerful legs taking long, steady strides. 

“Wolf acts as if he knows where we’re going,” I said, a little surprised. 

“Maybe he’s been here before,” Will replied. “Maybe he’s a swamp 
dog.” 

“Maybe,” I replied thoughtfully, staring down at Wolf. Where do you 
come from, dog? I wondered. He certainly did seem at home in the swamp. 

In a short while, we came to the edge of the peat bog. I wiped the 
sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand and stared across the oval¬ 
shaped pond. 

Shafts of sunlight made the green surface sparkle. Thousands of tiny 
white insects fluttered just above it, catching the light, glistening like little 
diamonds. 

Will picked up a small tree branch. He cracked it in half between his 
hands. Then he heaved one of the halves high into the air. 

It hit the surface of the bog with more of a thunk than a splash. And 
then it just lay there. It didn’t sink. 

“Weird,” I said. “Let’s try something heavier.” 

I started to search for something, but a low growl caught my attention. 
I turned toward the sound. To my surprise, it was coming from Wolf. 

The dog had lowered its big head. Its entire body stood tensed, as if in 
attack position. Its dark lips were pulled back, revealing two sharp rows of 
teeth. It uttered a low growl, then another. 

“I think he senses danger,” Will said softly. 



14 


Wolf uttered another menacing growl, baring his jagged teeth. The fur on 
his back stood up stiffly. His legs tensed as if preparing to attack. 

The sound of crackling twigs made me raise my eyes. I saw a gray 
figure darting behind tall weeds on the other side of the bog. 

“Who—who’s that?” Will whispered. 

I stared straight ahead, unable to speak. 

“Is that—” Will started. 

“Yes,” I managed to choke out. “It’s him. The swamp hermit.” I 
dropped quickly to my knees, hoping to keep out of view. 

But had he already seen us? 

Had he been there at the other side of the bog all along? 

Will must have been sharing my thoughts. “Has that weirdo been 
spying on us?” he demanded, huddling beside me. 

Wolf uttered a quiet growl, still frozen in place, ready to attack. 

Keeping low, I scooted closer to the dog. For protection, I guess. 

I watched the strange man as he made his way through the weeds. His 
long, gray-white hair was wild, standing straight out around his face. He 
kept glancing behind him as he walked, as if making sure he wasn’t being 
followed. 

He carried a brown sack over one shoulder. 

He turned his gaze in our direction. I dropped down lower, trying to 
hide behind Wolf, my heart pounding. 

Wolf hadn’t moved, but he was silent now. His ears were still pulled 
back, his lips still open in a soundless snarl. 

What were those dark stains on the front of the swamp hermit’s grimy 
shirt? 

Bloodstains? 

A shiver of fear ran down my back. 

Wolf stared straight ahead without blinking, without moving a muscle. 

The swamp hermit disappeared behind the tall weeds. We couldn’t see 
him, but we could still hear his footsteps crunching over dead leaves and 
fallen twigs. 



I glanced over at Wolf. The big dog shook himself, as if shaking the 
swamp hermit from his mind. His tail wagged slowly. His body relaxed. 

He uttered soft whimpers, as if telling me how scared he had been. 

“It’s okay, boy,” I said quietly, and rubbed the soft fur on top of the 
dog’s head. He stopped whimpering and licked at my wrist. 

“That guy is creepy!” Will exclaimed, climbing slowly to his feet. 

“He even scared the dog,” I said, petting Wolf some more. “What do 
you think he had in the sack?” 

“Probably someone’s head!” Will said, his dark eyes wide with horror. 

I laughed. But I stopped when I saw that Will wasn’t joking. 
“Everyone says he’s harmless,” I said. 

“He had blood all over the front of his shirt,” Will said with a shudder. 
He scratched his short, dark hair nervously. 

The sunlight faded quickly as clouds rolled over the sun. Long 
shadows crept over the bog. The stick Will had thrown had disappeared, 
sucked into the thick, murky water. 

“Let’s get home,” I suggested. 

“Yeah. Okay,” Will agreed quickly. 

I called to Wolf, who was exploring in the tall weeds. Then we turned 
and started to make our way back along the twisting dirt path. 

A soft breeze fluttered the trees, making the palm leaves scrape and 
clatter. Tall ferns shivered in the wind. The shadows grew deeper and 
darker. 

I could hear Wolf behind us. I could hear his body brushing through 
low shrubs and weeds. 

We were nearly to where the trees ended and the flat grass leading to 
our back yards began. We were nearly out of the swamp when Will stopped 
suddenly. 

I saw his mouth drop open in horror. 

I turned to follow his gaze. 

Then I uttered a shocked cry and covered my eyes to shut out the 
gmesome sight. 



15 


When I opened my eyes, the hideous pile of feathers and blood-covered 
flesh was still at my feet. 

“Wh-what is it?” Will stammered. 

It took me a long while to realize we were staring at a bird. A large 
heron. 

It was hard to recognize because it had been torn apart. 

Long, white feathers were scattered over the soft ground. The poor 
bird’s chest had been torn wide open. 

“The swamp hermit!” Will cried. 

“Huh?” I cried. I turned away from the hideous sight and tried to force 
the image from my mind. 

“That’s why he had blood all over his shirt!” Will declared. 

“But why would he rip a bird apart?” I asked weakly. 

“Because... because he’s a monster !” Will exclaimed. 

“He’s just a weird old guy who lives alone in the swamp,” I said. “He 
didn’t do this, Will. Some kind of animal did it. Look!” I pointed to the 
ground. 

There were paw prints in the soft ground. All around the dead bird. 

“They look like dog’s paws,” I said, thinking out loud. 

“Dogs don’t rip apart birds,” Will replied quietly. 

At that moment, Wolf came bounding up to us through the weeds. He 
came to a stop in front of the dead bird and started to sniff it. 

“Get away from there, Wolf,” I ordered. “Come on. Get away.” I 
tugged him back, pulling him with both hands around his thick neck. 

“Let’s get home,” Will said. “Let’s get away from this thing. I’m going 
to have bad dreams. I really will.” 

I pulled Wolf with both hands. We stepped carefully around the dead 
heron and then hurried toward the swamp edge. Neither of us said a word. I 
guess we were both still picturing what we had seen. 

As we reached the flat grass behind our houses, I said good-bye to 
Will. I watched him hurry to his house. Wolf scampered after him for part 
of the way. Then he turned and hurried back to me. 



The late afternoon sun burned its way through the clouds. I shielded 
my eyes from the sudden brightness, and saw my dad working in the deer 
pen behind the house. 

“Hey, Dad—” I ran toward him over the grass. 

He glanced up when I called to him. He was wearing denim cutoffs 
and a sleeveless yellow T-shirt. He had an Orlando Magic cap pulled down 
over his forehead. “What’s up, Grady?” 

“Will and I—we saw a dead heron,” I told him breathlessly. 

“Where? In the swamp?” he asked casually. He pulled off the cap, 
wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, and replaced the cap. 

“Dad, it—it was torn apart!” I cried. 

He didn’t react. “That’s part of life in the wild,” he said, pulling up one 
of the deer’s hooves to examine the bottom. “You know that, Grady. It can 
get pretty violent out there. We’ve talked about survival of the fittest and 
stuff like that.” 

“No, Dad. This is different,” I insisted. “The heron—it was ripped in 
two. I mean, like someone took it, and—” 

“Another bird, maybe,” Dad said, concentrating on the deer hoof. “A 
larger bird of prey. It could have been—” 

“We saw the swamp hermit,” I interrupted. “He had blood all over his 
shirt. Then we saw paw prints in the ground. All around the dead bird.” 

“Grady, calm down,” Dad said, setting down the deer’s leg. “If you go 
exploring in the swamp, you’re going to see a lot of frightening-looking 
things. But don’t let your imagination run away with you.” 

“Will said it was done by a monster!” I exclaimed. 

Dad frowned and scratched his head through the cap. “I see your new 
friend has a good imagination, too,” he said quietly. 

That night, I was glad my parents agreed to let Wolf sleep in my room. I felt 
a lot safer with the big dog curled up on the rug beside my bed. 

I hadn’t been able to shake the ugly picture of the dead heron from my 
mind. I watched some TV until dinnertime. Then after dinner, I played a 
long chess game with Emily. 

But no matter what I did, I kept seeing the white feathers scattered 
over the ground, the torn-apart bird lying crumpled on the path. 

So now I felt a little comforted with Wolf sleeping in the room. “You’ll 



protect me, won’t you, boy?” I whispered from my bed. 

He uttered a low snort. Light from the full moon spilled over him 
through the window. I saw that he was sleeping with his head resting on his 
two front paws. 

Then I drifted into a dreamless sleep. 

I don’t know how long I slept. 

I was awakened some time later by a horrifying crash. 

I sat straight up with a startled gasp. 

The crash had come from the living room, I realized. 

Someone was breaking in! 



16 


Was it a burglar? 

I climbed out of bed, my heart pounding, and crept to the door. 

Another crash. A loud thump. 

Footsteps. 

“Who—who is it?” I cried. My voice came out in a choked whisper. 

Keeping against the wall, I made my way slowly toward the living 
room. “Who’s there?” I shouted. 

Mom and Dad and Emily met me in the dark hallway. Even in the 
darkness I could see the fear and confusion on their faces. 

I was the first to the living room. Pale yellow light from the full moon 
washed across the room. “Hey!” I called out. 

Wolf leaped against the big front window. His shoulders made a loud 
thud against the glass. 

“Wolf—stop!” I cried. 

In the pale light, I saw what had caused the loud crash. Wolf had 
knocked over the table and a lamp that had stood in front of the window. 

“He—he’s trying to get outside,” I stammered. 

I felt Dad’s hand on the shoulder of my pajama shirt. “What a mess 
he’s made,” he murmured. 

“Wolf—stop!” I called again. 

The big dog turned, breathing hard. His eyes glowed red in the 
moonlight through the window. 

“Why is he so desperate to get out?” Emily demanded. 

“We can’t have him in the house if he does this every night,” Mom 
said, her voice hoarse from sleep. 

The big dog lowered his head and let out an excited growl. His tail 
stood straight up behind him. 

“Open the front door. Let him out,” Mom said. “Before he wrecks the 
whole house.” 

Dad hurried across the room and pulled open the door. Wolf didn’t 
hesitate for a second. He bounded to the door and burst out. 



I ran to the window to watch him. But the big dog disappeared around 
the side of the house, running toward the back yard. 

“He’s heading to the swamp,” I guessed. 

“He tried to break right through the window,” Mom said. 

Emily clicked on a lamp. “He’s so strong, he probably could have 
broken the window,” she said quietly. 

Dad closed the front door. He yawned. Then he turned his gaze on me. 
“You know what this means, don’t you, Grady?” 

I was still staring out at the full moon. “No. What?” 

“Wolf will have to stay outdoors from now on,” Dad said. He stooped 
and began picking up pieces of the broken lamp. 

“But, Dad—” I started to protest. 

“He’s too big and too restless to stay in the house,” Dad continued. He 
handed the lamp pieces to Emily. Then he pulled the table rightside up and 
returned it to its place in front of the window. 

“Wolf didn’t mean to break the lamp,” I argued weakly. 

“He’ll break everything we have,” Mom said quietly. 

“He’s just too big,” Dad added. “He’ll have to stay outside, Grady.” 

“Why did he want out so desperately?” Emily demanded. 

“He’s probably used to being outside,” Dad told her. “He’ll be happier 
out there,” he said, turning to me. 

“Yeah. Maybe,” I replied glumly. I liked having Wolf sleep beside me 
in my bedroom. But I knew there was no way I could convince my parents 
to give the dog a second chance. Their minds were made up. 

And at least they were letting me keep Wolf. 

I pulled the vacuum cleaner out of the closet and plugged it in. Dad 
took the nozzle and began vacuuming up the tiny pieces of glass from the 
carpet. 

That crazy dog, I thought, shaking my head unhappily. What is his 
problem, anyway? 

When Dad finished, I carried the vacuum cleaner back to the closet. 

“Now maybe we can all sleep in peace,” Mom said, yawning. 

She was wrong. 



17 


I heard the frightening howls again a short while later. 

At first I thought I was dreaming them. 

But when I opened my eyes and gazed around my dark bedroom, the 
howls continued. Still half asleep, I gripped the covers with both hands and 
pulled them up to my chin. 

The howls sounded so close, as if they were right outside my window. 
They didn’t seem like the cries of an animal. They were too angry, too 
deliberate. 

Too human. 

Stop trying to frighten yourself, I thought. It’s a wolf. It has to be some 
kind of swamp wolf. 

In the back of my mind, I knew it might be Wolf making those 
frightening sounds. But I kept pushing the thought away. 

Why would the dog howl like that? 

Dogs bark. They don’t howl unless they’re very sad or upset. 

I shut my eyes, wishing the frightening wails away. 

Suddenly, they stopped. Silence. 

Then I heard rapid thumps on the ground. Footsteps. 

Some kind of a struggle. 

I heard a short, terrifying cry. It cut off almost as soon as it began. 

It’s right in back of the house, I realized. 

Wide awake now, I jumped out of bed, dragging the covers with me. I 
stumbled to the bedroom window and grabbed the windowsill. 

The full moon had risen high in the night sky. The back yard stretched 
out silvery in the moonlight, the dewy grass shimmering in the bright light. 

Pressing my forehead against the windowpane, I peered out toward the 
dark swamp. I uttered a near-silent gasp when I saw the shadowy creature 
running toward the trees. 

A large creature, running on all fours. 

It was only a black outline fading into the darkness. But I could see 
how big it was, and I could see how fast it was running. 



And I heard its howls. Triumphant howls, I thought. 

Is it Wolf? I wondered. I peered out the window without moving, even 
though the darkness had swallowed the creature up. I could see only the 
outline of distant trees. 

But I could still hear the howls rising and falling on the heavy night 
air. 

Is it Wolf? 

It can’t be Wolf—can it? 

I lowered my gaze. My breath caught in my throat. I saw something. In 
the middle of the backyard. A few feet from the deer pen. 

At first I thought it was a pile of rags. 

My hands trembled as I pulled open my window. 

I had to get a better look. I had to see what that was in the back yard. 

I pulled up my pajama bottoms. Then, gripping the windowsill, I 
lowered myself out the window onto the grass. 

The wet grass felt cold under my bare feet. I turned to the deer pen. 
The six swamp deer were standing tensely, huddled together against the 
house. Their dark eyes followed me as I began to creep across the grass. 

What is that thing? I wondered, staring into the silvery light. 

Is it just a pile of old rags? 

No. 

What is it? 



18 


My bare feet felt cold and wet as I made my way slowly across the dew- 
covered grass. The night air was heavy and still, still as death. 

When I came close enough to see what was lying in a heap on the 
grass, I uttered a faint cry and started to gag. 

I pressed a hand against my mouth and swallowed hard. 

I realized I was staring down at a rabbit. Its small, black eyes were 
frozen open in terror. One of its ears had been pulled off. 

The rabbit had been ripped open, nearly torn in half. 

I forced myself to look away. 

My stomach still heaving, I hurried back over the wet grass to my open 
window and scrambled back in. 

As I struggled to pull the window shut, the howls rang out again, rising 
triumphantly from the nearby swamp. 

After breakfast the next morning, I led Dad out to the back yard to show 
him the murdered rabbit. It was a bright, hot day, and a red sun climbed a 
pale, clear sky. 

As soon as we stepped off the back stoop, Wolf appeared from around 
the side of his house. His tail began wagging furiously. He came running 
excitedly to greet me, as if he hadn’t seen me in years, leaping onto my 
chest, nearly knocking me over. 

“Down, Wolf! Down!” I cried, laughing as the dog stretched to lick my 

face. 

“Your dog is a killer,” a voice said behind me. I turned to see that 
Emily had followed us. She was wearing a red T-shirt over white tennis 
shorts. She had her arms crossed in front of her, and she was glaring 
disapprovingly at Wolf. “Look what he did to that poor bunny rabbit,” she 
said, shaking her head. 

“Whoa. Hold on,” I replied, petting Wolf’s gray fur. “Who said Wolf 
did this?” 

“Who else would have done it?” Emily demanded. “He’s a killer.” 

“Oh, yeah? Look how gentle he is,” I insisted. I put my wrist in Wolf’s 



mouth. He clamped down gently on it, being careful not to hurt me. 

“Wolf may be a bit of a hunter,” Dad said thoughtfully. He had been 
staring down at the rabbit, but now he turned his glance to the deer pen. 

Huddled together at one end of the pen, the deer were all staring warily 
at Wolf. They had their heads lowered cautiously as they followed the dog’s 
every move. 

“I’m glad they’re safe inside that pen,” Dad said softly. 

“Dad, you have to get rid of this dog!” Emily said shrilly. 

“No way!” I cried. I turned angrily to my sister. “You have no proof 
that Wolf did anything wrong!” I shouted. “No proof at all!” 

“You have no proof that he didn’t do it!” Emily replied nastily. 

“Of course he didn’t!” I cried, feeling myself lose control. “Didn’t you 
hear the howls last night? Didn’t you hear those frightening howls? It 
wasn’t a dog howling like that. Dogs don’t howl like that!” 

“Then what was it?” Emily demanded. 

“I heard them, too,” Dad said, stepping between us. “They sounded 
more like wolf howls. Or maybe a coyote.” 

“See?” I told Emily. 

“But I’d be very surprised to find a wolf or coyote in this area,” Dad 
continued, gazing out toward the swamp. 

Emily still had her arms crossed tightly over her chest. She gazed 
down at Wolf and shuddered. “He’s dangerous, Dad. You really have to get 
rid of him.” 

Dad walked over and patted Wolf’s head. He scratched Wolf under the 
chin. Wolf licked Dad’s hand. 

“Let’s just be careful around him,” Dad said. “He seems very gentle. 
But we don’t really know anything about him—do we? So let’s be very 
careful, okay?” 

“I’m going to be careful,” Emily replied, narrowing her eyes at Wolf. 
“I’m going to stay as far away from that monster as I can.” She turned and 
stormed back to the house. 

Dad made his way to the shed to get a shovel and box to carry away 
the dead rabbit in. 

I dropped to my knees and hugged Wolf’s broad neck. “You aren’t a 
monster, are you, boy?” I asked. “Emily is crazy, isn’t she? You’re not a 
monster. That wasn’t you I saw running toward the swamp last night, was 



it?” 


Wolf raised his deep blue eyes to mine. He stared hard at me. 
He seemed to be trying to tell me something. 

But I had no idea what it could be. 



19 


That night I didn’t hear the howls. 

I woke up in the middle of the night and stared out the window. Wolf 
was gone, probably exploring the swamp. In the morning, I knew he’d 
come running back to greet me as if I were a long lost friend. 

The next morning Will showed up just as I was giving Wolf his 
breakfast, a big bowl of crunchy, dry dog food. “Hey, what’s up?” Will 
asked, his usual greeting. 

“Nothing much,” I said. I rolled up the top of the big bag of dog food 
and dragged it back into the kitchen. Wolf stood over his bowl, his head 
lowered, chewing noisily away. 

I pushed open the screen door and returned to Will. He was wearing a 
dark blue muscle shirt and black Lycra bike shorts. He had a green-and- 
yellow Forest Service cap pulled down over his dark hair. 

“Want to go exploring?” he asked in his hoarse voice, watching Wolf 
hungrily gobble down his breakfast. “You know. In the swamp?” 

“Yeah. Sure,” I said. I called inside to tell my parents where I was 
going. Then I followed Will across the back lawn toward the swamp. 

Wolf came scampering after us. He’d run past us, then let us catch up. 
Then he’d run in crazy zigzags in front of us, behind us, romping happily 
under the hot morning sun. 

“Did you hear about Mr. Warner?” Will asked. He stopped to pick up a 
long blade of grass and put it between his teeth. 

“Who?” 

“Ed Warner,” Will replied. “I guess you haven’t met the Warners yet. 
They live in the very last house.” He turned and pointed behind us to the 
last white house at the end of the row of white houses. 

“What about him?” I asked, nearly tripping over Wolf, who had come 
rumbling past my feet. 

“He’s missing,” Will replied, chewing on the grass blade. “He didn’t 
come home last night.” 

“Huh? From where?” I asked, turning to stare at the Warners’ house. 
Heat waves shimmered up from the grass, making the house appear to bend 



and quiver. 

“From the swamp,” Will replied darkly. “Mrs. Warner called my mom 
this morning. She said Mr. Warner went hunting yesterday afternoon. He 
likes to hunt wild turkeys. He took me with him a couple times. He’s real 
good at chasing them down. When he kills one, he hangs its feet up on his 
den wall.” 

“He does?” I cried. It sounded pretty gross to me. 

“Yeah. You know. Like a trophy,” Will continued. “Anyway, he went 
hunting wild turkeys in the swamp yesterday afternoon, and he hasn’t come 
home.” 

“Weird,” I said, watching Wolf stop at the edge of the trees. “Maybe he 
got lost.” 

“No way,” Will insisted, shaking his head. “Not Mr. Warner. He’s lived 
here a long time. He was the first one to move here. Mr. Warner wouldn’t 
get lost.” 

“Then maybe the werewolf got him!” called a strange voice behind us. 



20 


Startled, we both spun around to see a girl about our age. She had rust- 
colored red hair tied in a ponytail on one side. She had catlike green eyes, 
and a short stub of a nose, and freckles all over her face. She was wearing 
faded red denim jeans and a T-shirt with a grinning green alligator on the 
front. 

“Cassie, what are you doing here?” Will demanded. 

“Following you,” she replied, making a face at him. She turned to me. 
“You’re the new kid, Grady, right? Will told me about you.” 

“Hi,” I said awkwardly. “He told me a girl lived in the neighborhood. 
But he didn’t tell me much about you.” 

“What’s to tell?” Will teased. 

“I’m Cassie O’Rourke,” she said. She shot up her hand and pulled the 
blade of grass from Will’s mouth. 

“Hey!” He playfully tried to slug her, but missed. 

“What did you say about a werewolf?” I asked. 

“Don’t start with that stuff again,” Will grumbled to Cassie. “It’s so 
stupid.” 

“You’re just afraid,” Cassie accused. 

“No, I’m not. It’s too stupid,” Will insisted. 

We stepped into the shade of the trees at the swamp edge. A funnel 
cloud of white gnats whirred crazily in a shaft of light between the trees. 

“There’s a werewolf in the swamp,” Cassie said, lowering her voice as 
we ducked past the gnats and moved deeper into the shade. 

“And I’m going to flap my wings and fly to Mars,” Will said 
sarcastically. 

“Shut up, Will,” Cassie snapped. “Grady doesn’t think it’s stupid—do 
you?” 

I shrugged. “I don’t know,” I said. “I don’t think I believe in 
werewolves.” 

Will laughed. “Cassie believes in the Easter Bunny, too,” he said. 

Cassie socked him hard in the chest. 

“Hey!” Will cried out angrily as he staggered back. “What’s your 



problem?” 

“Mosquito,” she said, pointing. “A big one. I got him.” 

Scowling, Will glanced down. “I don’t see any mosquito. Give me a 
break, Cassie.” 

We made our way along the winding path. It had rained the day before. 
The ground was marshier than usual. We kept slipping in the soft mud. 

“Do you hear the howling sounds at night?” I asked Cassie. 

“That’s the werewolf,” she replied softly. Her green cat-eyes burned 
into mine. “I’m not kidding around, Grady. I’m serious. Those howls aren’t 
human. Those howls come from a werewolf who has just killed.” 

Will snickered. “You’ve got a good imagination, Cassie. I guess you 
watch a lot of scary movies on TV, huh?” 

“Real life is scarier than the movies,” she said, lowering her voice to a 
whisper. 

“Ooh, stop. You’re making me shake all over!” Will exclaimed 
sarcastically. 

She didn’t reply. She was still staring at me as we walked. “You 
believe me, don’t you?” 

“I don’t know,” I said. 

The bog came into view. The air became heavier, wetter. The tall 
weeds on the other side stood straight up. The bog gurgled quietly. Two big 
flies danced over the dark green surface. 

“There’s no such thing as werewolves, Cassie,” Will muttered, 
searching for something to throw into the bog. He grinned at her. “Unless 
maybe you ’re one!” 

She rolled her eyes. “Very funny.” She made biting motions with her 
teeth as if she were going to bite him. 

I heard a rustling sound across the oval-shaped bog. The tall weeds 
suddenly parted, and Wolf appeared at the edge of the water. 

“What does the werewolf look like?” Will asked sarcastically. “Does it 
have red hair and freckles?” 

Cassie didn’t reply. 

I turned to see a look of terror freeze on her face. Her green eyes grew 
wide, and her freckles seemed to fade. “Th-there’s the werewolf !” she 
stammered in a choked whisper. She pointed. 

Feeling a chill of fear, I turned to see where she was pointing. 



To my horror, she was pointing right at Wolf! 



21 


“No!” I started to protest. 

But then I saw that I had misunderstood. Cassie wasn’t pointing at 
Wolf. She was pointing to the figure moving through the tall weeds behind 
the dog. 

The swamp hermit! 

I saw him walking quickly behind the weeds, his shoulders bent, his 
mangy head bobbing with each step. 

As he moved into a small break in the weeds, I could see why he was 
leaning forward. He carried something over one shoulder. A bag of some 
sort. 

Wolf started to growl. 

The hermit stopped walking. 

It wasn’t a bag slung over his shoulder, I saw. It was a turkey. A wild 
turkey. 

A chilling thought burst into my mind: Had he taken it from Mr. 
Warner? 

Was Cassie right about the swamp hermit? Was he a werewolf? Had he 
done something horrible to Mr. Warner and claimed the wild turkey as his 
prize? 

I tried to dismiss these horrible thoughts. They were crazy. Impossible. 

But Cassie looked so frightened, staring across the gurgling green bog 
at the wild-eyed hermit. And the howls at night, the howls had been so 
frightening, so human. 

And the dead animals I’d seen, torn so brutally apart, as if... as if by a 
werewolf! 

Wolf uttered another warning growl. He stared at the hermit, his tail 
standing stiffly behind him, his fur rising up on his back. 

The hermit moved quickly. I saw his dark eyes flash just before he 
disappeared behind the weeds. 

“It’s him!” Cassie cried, still pointing. “It’s the werewolf!” 

“Cassie —shut up!” Will warned. “He’ll hear you!” 

I swallowed hard, frozen in place by my fear. I saw the weeds tremble 



across the bog. I heard rustling sounds growing closer. 

“Run!” Will cried, his hoarse voice shrill and frightened. “Come on— 

run!” 

Too late. 

The swamp hermit burst out of the weeds right behind us. “I’m the 
werewolf!” he shrieked. His eyes were wild, excited. His face, surrounded 
by his long, tangled hair, was bright red. “I’m the werewolf!” 

He had heard Cassie! 

Laughing at the top of his lungs, he tossed up both hands, then began 
to swing the turkey in a wide circle over his head. “I’m the werewolf!” he 
cried. 

Cassie, Will, and I all cried out at the same time. 

Then we started to run. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Wolf. He hadn’t moved from 
his spot across the bog. But now, as I started to mn, he came bounding 
toward us, barking excitedly. 

“I’m the werewolf!” the hermit shrieked. He howled with laughter, still 
swinging the turkey as he chased after us. 

“Leave us alone!” Cassie cried, running beside Will a few steps ahead 
of me. “Do you hear me? Leave us alone!” 

Her pleas made the hermit howl again. 

My shoes slipped in the muddy ground. 

I turned back. He was gaining on me. Right behind me. 

Gasping for breath, I struggled to run faster. Sharp vines and heavy 
leaves slapped at my face and arms as I plunged forward. 

It was all a blur now. A blur of light and shade, trees and vines, tall 
weeds and sharp brambles. 

“I’m the werewolf! I’m the werewolf!” 

The crazed hermit’s high-pitched wails of laughter echoed through the 
swamp. 

Keep going, Grady, I urged myself. Keep going. 

Then, with a terrified cry, I felt my feet slide out from under me. 

I fell face forward into the mud, landing hard on my hands and knees. 

He’s got me, I realized. 

The werewolf has got me. 



22 


I tried frantically to scramble up from the mud. But I slipped again and 
tumbled forward with a splat. 

He’s got me now, I thought. 

The werewolf has got me now. I cannot escape. 

My muscles all froze in panic. I struggled to crawl away. 

I turned back, expecting the hermit to grab me. 

But he had stopped several yards away. The turkey dangled to the 
ground as he stared down at me, a strange grin on his weathered face. 

Where was Wolf? I wondered. 

Wolf had been growling furiously at the swamp hermit. Why hadn’t 
Wolf attacked? 

“Help! Will! Cassie!” I called desperately. 

Silence. 

They were gone. They were both probably out of the swamp by now, 
running for home. 

I was alone. Alone to face the hermit. 

I stumbled to my feet, my eyes locked on his. Why was he grinning at 
me like that? 

“Go on. Go,” he murmured, gesturing with his free hand. “Just teasing 
you.” 

“What?” My voice came out tiny and frightened. 

“Go. I’m not going to bite you,” he said. His grin faded. The light 
seemed to dim in his shiny black eyes. 

Wolf appeared behind him. The dog gazed up at the hermit, then 
lowered his eyes to the dead turkey. He barked once, a shrill yip. But I 
could see that Wolf had relaxed. He had no intention of attacking the 
hermit. 

“This dog yours?” the hermit asked, eyeing Wolf warily. 

“Yeah,” I replied, still breathing hard. “I... found him.” 

“Watch out for him,” the hermit said sharply. Then he turned and, 
hoisting the large bird on his shoulder, headed back into the weeds. 



“W-watch out for him?” I stammered. “What do you mean?” 

But the hermit didn’t reply. I could hear him brushing the tall weeds 
away as he disappeared back into the swamp. 

“What do you mean?” I called after him. 

But he was gone. The swamp was silent now except for the chirping 
and clicking of insects and the dry sound of palm leaves brushing against 
each other. 

I stared straight ahead at the tall weeds. I guess I expected the swamp 
hermit to return, to burst back into view, to attack again. 

Two white moths fluttered together over the weeds. Nothing else 
moved. 

He was teasing us, he had said. 

That’s all it was, just teasing. 

I swallowed hard. Then I forced myself to breathe normally again. 

After a while, I lowered my gaze to Wolf. The dog was busily sniffing 
the ground where the hermit had stood. 

“Wolf—why didn’t you protect me?” I scolded. 

The dog glanced up, then returned to his sniffing. 

“Hey, dog—are you a big coward?” I asked, brushing at the wet dirt on 
the knees of my jeans. “Is that your problem? You sound real tough, but 
you’re actually a big chicken?” 

Wolf ignored me. 

I turned and headed home, thinking about the hermit’s warning. As I 
made my way along the narrow path, I could hear Wolf running through the 
weeds and tall grass, following close behind. 

“Watch out for him, ” the hermit had said. 

Was he teasing about that, too? Was he just trying to scare me? 

The strange man saw that Will, Cassie, and I were afraid of him. So he 
decided to have some fun with us. 

That’s all it was, I decided. 

He heard Cassie call him a werewolf. So he decided to give us a real 
scare. 

As I walked along the marshy ground under the shade of the tilted 
palm trees, my mind spun with thoughts about Cassie and Will and Wolf 
and werewolves. 

I didn’t see the snake until I stepped on it. 



I glanced down in time to see its bright green head shoot forward. 
I felt a sharp stab of pain as its fangs dug into my ankle. 

The pain jolted up my leg. 

I uttered a choked gasp before I crumpled to the ground. 



23 


I hit the ground and curled into a tight ball as the pain throbbed through my 
body. 

Red dots formed in my eyes. The dots grew larger and larger until I 
saw only red. The color shimmered in rhythm to the throbbing pain. 

Through the curtain of red, I saw the snake slither into the bushes. 

I grabbed my ankle, trying to force the pain down. 

Slowly, the red faded, then vanished, leaving only the pain. 

My hand suddenly felt wet. 

Blood? 

I glanced down to see Wolf licking my hand. Fierce licking, as if 
trying to cure me, trying to make everything okay again. 

Despite the pain, I laughed. “It’s okay, boy,” I said. “I’m okay.” 

He kept licking my hand until I climbed to my feet. I felt a little dizzy. 
My legs were shaky. 

I tried putting weight on the foot that had been bitten. 

It felt a little better. 

I took a step, limping. Then another. 

“Let’s go, Wolf,” I said. He gazed up at me sympathetically. 

I knew I had to get home quickly. If the snake was poisonous, I was in 
big trouble. I had no way of knowing how much time I had before the 
venom would paralyze me completely—or worse. 

Wolf stayed by my side as I limped over the soft ground toward home. 
I was gasping for breath. My chest felt tight. The ground swayed beneath 
me. 

Was it because of the snake venom? Or was it just because I was so 
frightened? 

Pain shot up my side with every step I took. 

But I kept pulling myself along, talking to Wolf all the while, ignoring 
the throbbing ache of my ankle. 

“We’re almost there, Wolf,” I said, panting loudly. “Almost there, 
boy.” 



The dog sensed that something was seriously wrong. He stayed by my 
side instead of running his usual zigzag patterns in front of me and behind 
me. 

The end of the trees came into view. I could see bright sunlight just 
beyond the swamp. 

“Hey—” a voice called to me. I saw Will and Cassie waiting for me on 
the flat grass. 

They began running toward me. “Are you okay?” Cassie called. 

“No. I... I got bit!” I managed to choke out. “Please—go get my dad!” 

They both took off, running full speed to my house. I dropped down on 
the grass, spreading my legs straight out, and waited. 

I tried to stay calm, but it was impossible. 

Was the snake poisonous? Was the venom heading straight to my 
heart? Was I about to die any second? 

I reached down with both hands and carefully, carefully, pulled off my 
mud-covered sneaker. Then, moving it a tiny bit at a time, I lowered my 
white sock down over the ankle and off my foot. 

The ankle was a little swollen. The skin was red except for a white, 
puckered spot around the bite. Inside that spot, I saw two small puncture 
marks, bright red droplets of blood oozing from each hole. 

When I raised my eyes from the wound, I saw my dad, dressed in 
brown shorts and a white T-shirt, hurrying along the flat grass toward me, 
followed closely by Will and Cassie. 

“What happened?” I heard my dad ask them. “What happened to 
Grady?” 

“He was bitten by a werewolf!” I heard Cassie reply. 


* * * 


“Keep the ice pack on it,” Dad instructed. “The swelling will go down.” 

I groaned and held the ice pack against my ankle. 

Mom tsk-tsked from the kitchen table. She had a newspaper spread out 
in front of her. I couldn’t tell if she was tsk-tsking over me or over the day’s 
news. 

Outside the screen door I could see Wolf, on his side on the grass just 
past the back stoop, sound asleep. Emily was in the front room, watching 



some soap on TV. 

“How does it feel?” Mom asked. 

“A lot better,” I told her. “I think I was mainly scared.” 

“Green snakes aren’t poisonous,” Dad reminded me for the tenth time. 
“But I took every precaution, just in case. We’ll wrap it up really good 
when you’re through putting ice on it.” 

“What was all that talk about werewolves?” Mom asked. 

“Cassie has werewolves on the brain,” I said. “She thinks the swamp 
hermit is a werewolf.” 

“She seems like a sweet girl,” Mom said quietly. “I had a nice talk 
with her while your father was taking care of your bite. You’re lucky, 
Grady, to find two kids your age out here on the edge of a swamp.” 

“Yeah, I guess,” I replied, shifting the ice pack on the ankle. “But she 
was driving Will and me nuts with all her werewolf talk.” 

Dad was washing his hands in the kitchen sink. He dried them on a 
dish towel, then turned to me. “That old swamp hermit is supposed to be 
harmless,” he said. “At least, that’s what everyone says.” 

“Well, he gave us a real scare,” I told him. “He chased us through the 
swamp, shouting, T’m the werewolf!”’ 

“Weird,” Dad replied thoughtfully. He tossed the dish towel onto the 
counter. 

“You should stay away from him,” Mom said, looking up from the 
newspaper. 

“Do you believe in werewolves?” I asked. 

Dad snickered. “Your mom and I are scientists, Grady. We’re not 
supposed to believe in supernatural things like werewolves.” 

“Your father is a werewolf,” Mom joked. “I have to shave his back 
every morning so he’ll look human.” 

“Ha-ha,” I said sarcastically. “I’m serious. I mean, haven’t you heard 
the weird howls at night?” 

“Lots of creatures howl,” Mom replied. “I’ll bet you howled when that 
snake bit your ankle!” 

“Can’t you be serious?” I cried shrilly. “You know, the howls didn’t 
start until it was a full moon.” 

“I remember. The howls didn’t start until that dog showed up!” Emily 
called from the front room. 



“Emily, give me a break!” I shouted. 

“Your dog is a werewolf!” Emily called. 

“Enough werewolf talk,” Mom muttered. “Look. I’ve got hair growing 
on my palms!” She held up her hands. 

“That’s just ink off the newspaper,” Dad said. He turned to me. “See? 
There’s a scientific explanation for everything.” 

“I really would like to be taken seriously,” I said through clenched 
teeth. 

“Well...” Dad glanced outside. Wolf had rolled onto his back and was 
sleeping with all four legs up in the air. “The moon will look full for only 
two more nights,” Dad told me. “Tonight and tomorrow night. If the howls 
stop after tomorrow night, we’ll know it was a werewolf, howling at the full 
moon.” 

Dad chuckled. He thought it was all a big joke. 

We had no idea that something was about to happen that night that 
might change his opinion about werewolves—forever. 



24 


Will and Cassie came over after dinner. Mom and Dad were still loading 
dishes into the dishwasher and cleaning up. Emily had hurried into town to 
go to the only movie playing. 

I was walking around pretty well. The ankle barely hurt at all. Dad’s a 
pretty good doctor, I guess. 

The three of us settled in the front room, and we instantly got into an 
argument about werewolves. 

Cassie insisted that the swamp hermit wasn’t kidding, that he really 
was a werewolf. 

Will told her she was a complete jerk. “He only chased us because he 
heard you call him a werewolf,” he told Cassie angrily. 

“Why do you think he lives by himself way deep in the swamp?” 
Cassie demanded of Will. “Because he knows what happens to him when 
the moon is full, and he doesn’t want anyone else to know it!” 

“Then why did he scream to us that he was a werewolf this 
afternoon?” Will asked impatiently. “Because he was just joking, that’s 
why.” 

“Come on, guys. Let’s change the subject,” I said. “My parents are 
both scientists, and they say there’s no proof that werewolves exist.” 

“That’s what scientists always say,” Cassie insisted. 

“They’re right,” Will said. “There are no werewolves except in 
movies. You’re a real jerk, Cassie.” 

“You’re a jerk!” Cassie shouted back. 

I could see they’d had fights like this before. “Let’s play a game or 
something,” I suggested. “Want to play some Nintendo? It’s in my room.” 

“Mr. Warner still hasn’t shown up,” Cassie told Will, ignoring me. She 
tugged at her red ponytail, then tossed it behind her head. “You know why? 
Because he was murdered by the werewolf!” 

“Don’t be stupid,” Will said. “How do you know?” 

“Maybe you ’re the werewolf!” I told Cassie. 

Will laughed. “Yeah. That’s why you’re such an expert, Cassie.” 

“Oh, shut up,” Cassie grumbled. “You look more like a werewolf than 



me, Will!” 

“You look like a vampirel” he told her. 

“Well, you look like King Kong!” she cried. 

“What are you kids talking about?” Mom interrupted, poking her head 
into the room. 

“Just talking about movies and things,” I replied quickly. 

I couldn’t get to sleep that night. I kept rolling onto one side, then the other. 
I couldn’t get comfortable. 

I kept listening for the howls. 

A strong wind had come up from the Gulf. I could hear it rushing past 
our small house. It rattled the wire mesh of the deer pen out back. It made a 
constant ssshhhhhh sound, and I strained to hear the familiar howls. 

I had just about drifted off to sleep when the howls began. 

Instantly alert, I jumped to my feet. My left ankle ached as I stepped 
down on it. 

Another howl. Far off. Barely carrying over the steady rush of the 
wind. 

I limped to my bedroom window. The ankle had stiffened up a bit 
while I was lying in bed. I pressed my face against the glass and peered out. 

The full moon, gray as a skull, hovered low in the charcoal sky. The 
dewy grass gleamed under its blanket of pale light. 

A burst of wind rattled my window. 

Startled, I pulled back. And listened. 

Another howl. Closer. 

This one sent a cold shudder down my back. 

It sounded really close. Or was the wind carrying it from the swamp? 

I squinted out the window. Swirls of wind made the grass sway from 
one side to the other. The ground appeared to be spinning, glowing in the 
pale moonlight as it twirled. 

Another howl. Even closer. 

I couldn’t see anything. I had to know who or what was making that 
terrifying sound. 

I pulled my jeans on over my pajama bottoms. Struggling in the dark, I 
managed to slide my feet into a pair of flip-flops. 

I started out of my room, but stopped short when I heard a banging. A 



loud crash. A pounding. A harsh thud. 

Right outside. 

Right outside my house. 

My heart pounding, I ran through the dark hallway. My ankle ached, 
but I ignored it. 

I hurried through the kitchen, unlocked the back door, and pulled it 
open. A strong gust of wind pushed me back as I opened the screen door. 

The wind was hot and wet. Another strong gust pushed me back. 

The wind is trying to keep me inside, I thought. Trying to keep me 
from solving the mystery of the terrifying howls. 

I lowered my head against the driving gusts and leapt down off the 
stoop. 

“Ow!” I cried out as pain shot up my leg. 

Waiting for my eyes to adjust to the dim light, I listened hard. 

No howls now. Just the shrill, steady rush of wind, pushing, pushing 
me back against the house. 

The back yard glowed in the moonlight. Everything was silver and 

gray. 

And silent. 

I searched the back yard, my eyes sweeping slowly across the shifting 
grass. Empty. 

But what had caused all the commotion I’d heard in my room? The 
banging? The loud thuds ? The rattling sounds? 

Why had the howls stopped when I came outside? 

What a mystery, I thought. What a strange mystery. 

The wind swirled around me. My face was dripping wet from the 
heavy dampness of the air. 

Feeling defeated, I turned back toward the house. 

And uttered a shocked cry when I saw that the werewolf had murdered 
again. 



25 


I took a step through the swirling wind toward the deer pen. 

“Dad!” I called. But my voice came out a hushed whisper. “Dad!” I 
tried to shout, but my throat was too dry and choked with fear. 

Staring straight ahead, I took another step. I could see it all clearly 
now. A scene of death. Pale light and shadows. The only sounds were the 
pounding of my heart, the swell of the wind, and the rattling of the wire 
mesh of the pen. 

I took another step closer. “Dad? Dad?” I cried out without thinking, 
without hearing myself, knowing he couldn’t hear. 

But I wanted him to be there. I wanted someone to be there with me. I 
didn’t want to be all alone out there in the back yard. 

I didn’t want to be staring at the hole that had been ripped in the side 
of the pen. I didn’t want to see the murdered deer lying so pitifully on its 
side. 

The five remaining deer huddled together at the other end of the pen. 
Their eyes were on me. Frightened eyes. 

The wind swept around me, hot and wet. But I felt cold all over. A cold 
shudder of terror ran down my body. I swallowed hard. Once. Twice. 
Trying to choke down the heavy lump in my throat. 

Then, before I even realized what I was doing, I began running to the 
house, screaming, “Dad! Mom! Dad! Mom!” at the top of my lungs. 

My cries rose on the gusting wind like the terrifying howls I’d heard 
just a few moments before. 

His pajama shirt flapping over the jeans he had pulled on, Dad dragged the 
dead deer to the back of the yard. Then, as I watched from the kitchen 
window, he patched the deer pen with a large sheet of box cardboard. 

As he tried to return to the house, the strong winds nearly blew the 
screen door off its hinges. Dad jerked the door shut, then locked it. 

His face was dripping with perspiration. He had mud down the side of 
one pajama sleeve. 

Mom poured him a glass of water from the sink, and he drank it down 



without taking a breath. Then he wiped the sweat from his forehead with a 
dish towel. 

Tm afraid your dog is a killer,” he said softly to me. He tossed the 
towel back onto the counter. 

“It wasn’t Wolf!” I cried. “It wasn’t!” 

Dad didn’t reply. He took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. Mom 
and Emily watched silently from in front of the sink. 

“What makes you think it was Wolf?” I demanded. 

“I saw the prints on the ground,” he replied, frowning. “Paw prints.” 

“It wasn’t Wolf,” I insisted. 

“I’m going to have to take him to the pound in the morning,” Dad said. 
“The one over in the next county.” 

“But they’ll kill him!” I cried. 

“The dog is a killer,” Dad insisted softly. “I know how you feel, Grady. 
I know. But the dog is a killer.” 

“It wasn’t Wolf,” I cried. “Dad, I know it wasn’t Wolf. I heard the 
howls, Dad. It was a wolf.” 

“Grady, please—” he started wearily. 

Then the words just burst out of me. I lost all control of them. They 
just poured out in a flood. “It was a werewolf, Dad. There’s a werewolf in 
the swamp. Cassie is right. It wasn’t a dog, and it wasn’t a wolf. It’s a 
werewolf who’s been killing animals, who killed your deer.” 

“Grady, stop—” Dad pleaded impatiently. 

But I couldn’t stop. “I know I’m right, Dad,” I cried in a shrill voice 
that didn’t sound like me. 

“It’s been a full moon this week, right? And that’s when the howls 
began. It’s a werewolf, Dad. The swamp hermit. That crazy guy who lives 
in the shack in the swamp. He’s a werewolf. He told us he is. He chased us 
and he told us he’s a werewolf. He did it, Dad. Not Wolf. He killed the deer 
tonight. I heard him howling outside, and then—then—” 

My voice caught in my throat. I started to choke. 

Dad filled the glass with water and handed it to me. I gulped it down 
thirstily. 

He put a hand on my shoulder. “Grady, let’s talk about it in the 
morning, okay? We’re both too tired to think straight now. What do you 
say?” 



“It wasn’t Wolf!” I cried stubbornly. “I know it wasn’t.” 

“In the morning,” Dad repeated, his hand still on my shoulder. He held 
it there to comfort me, to steady me. 

I felt shaky. I was panting. My heart pounded. 

“Yeah. Okay,” I agreed finally. “In the morning.” 

I made my way slowly to my room, but I knew I wouldn’t sleep. 

The next morning, Dad was gone when I got up. “He went to the lumber 
yard,” Mom told me, “to get wire mesh to repair the pen.” 

I yawned and stretched. I had fallen into a restless sleep at about two- 
thirty. But I still felt tired and nervous. 

“Is Wolf out there?” I asked anxiously. I ran to the kitchen window 
before she could reply. 

I could see Wolf at the head of the driveway. He had a blue mbber ball 
between his front paws, and he was chewing at it furiously. 

“Bet he’s hungry for breakfast,” I muttered. 

I heard the crunch of gravel, and Dad’s car pulled up the drive. The 
trunk was opened partway, a roll of wire mesh bulging inside. 

“Morning,” Dad said as he came into the kitchen. His expression was 
grim. 

“Are you going to take Wolf?” I demanded immediately. My eyes 
were on the dog, chewing on the rubber ball outside. He looked so cute. 

“People in town are upset,” Dad replied, pouring himself a cup of 
coffee from the coffeemaker. “A lot of animals have been killed this week. 
And a guy who lives down the way, Ed Warner, has disappeared in the 
swamp. People are very worried. They’ve heard the howls, too.” 

“Are you taking Wolf away?” I repeated shrilly, my voice trembling. 

Dad nodded. His expression remained grim. He took a long sip of 
coffee. “Go look at the paw prints outside the pen, Grady,” he said, locking 
his eyes on mine. “Go ahead. Take a look.” 

“I don’t care about prints,” I moaned. “I just know—” 

“I can’t take any more chances,” Dad said. 

“I don’t care! He’s my dog!” I screamed. 

“Grady—” Dad set down the cup and started toward me. 

But I burst past him and ran to the door. Pushing open the screen door, 
I leapt off the back stoop. 



Wolf stood up as soon as he saw me. His tail started to wag. Leaving 
the blue rubber ball behind, he began loping toward me eagerly. 

Dad was right behind me. “I’m going to take the dog away now, 
Grady,” he said. “Do you want to come along?” 

“No!” I cried. 

“I have no choice,” Dad said, his voice just above a whisper. He 
stepped forward and reached for Wolf. 

“No!” I shouted. “No! Run, Wolf! Run!” 

I gave the dog a shove. Wolf turned to me uncertainly. 

“Run!” I screamed. “Run! Run!” 



26 


I gave Wolf another hard shove. “Run! Run, boy! Go!” 

Dad had his hands around Wolf’s shoulders, but he didn’t have a good 

grip. 

Wolf broke free and started to run toward the swamp. 

“Hey—!” Dad called angrily. He chased Wolf to the end of the back 
yard. But the big dog was too fast for him. 

I stood behind the house, breathing hard, and watched Wolf until he 
disappeared into the low trees at the edge of the swamp. 

Dad turned back toward me, an angry expression on his face. “That 
was dumb, Grady,” he muttered. 

I didn’t say anything. 

“Wolf will come back later,” Dad said. “When he does, I’ll have to 
take him away.” 

“But, Dad—” I started. 

“No more discussion,” he said sternly. “As soon as the dog returns, 
I’m taking him to the pound.” 

“You can’tl” I screamed. 

“The dog is a killer, Grady. I have no choice.” Dad headed toward the 
car. “Come help me unload this wire mesh. I’ll need your help getting the 
pen patched up.” 

I gazed toward the swamp as I followed Dad to the car. Don’t come 
back, Wolf, I pleaded silently. Please, don ’t come back. 

All day long, I watched the swamp. I felt nervous, shaky. I had no appetite 
at all. After I helped Dad repair the deer pen, I stayed in my room. I tried to 
read a book, but the words were just a blur. 

By evening, Wolf hadn’t returned. 

You’re safe, Wolf, I thought. At least for today. 

My whole family was tense. At dinner, we hardly spoke. Emily talked 
about the movie she had seen the night before, but no one joined in with 
any comments. 

I went to bed early. I was really tired. From tension, I guess. And from 



being up most of the night before. 

My room was darker than usual. It was the last night of the full moon, 
but heavy blankets of clouds covered the moonlight. 

I settled my head onto my pillow and tried to get to sleep. But I kept 
thinking about Wolf. 

The howls started a short while later. 

I crept out of bed and hurried to the window. I squinted out into the 
darkness. Heavy, black clouds still covered the moon. The air was still. 
Nothing moved. 

I heard a low growl, and Wolf came into focus. 

He was standing stiffly in the middle of the back yard, his head tilted 
up to the sky, uttering low growls. As I stared out the window at him, the 
big dog began to pace, back and forth from one side of the yard to the other. 

He’s pacing like a caged animal, I thought. Pacing and growling, as if 
something is really troubling him. 

Or scaring him. 

As he paced, he kept raising his head toward the full moon behind the 
clouds and growling. 

What is going on? I wondered. I had to find out. 

I got dressed quickly in the darkness, pulling on the jeans and T-shirt I 
had worn all day. 

I fumbled into my sneakers. At first I had the left one on the right foot. 
It was so dark in my room without the moonlight pouring in! 

As soon as my sneakers were tied, I hurried back to the window. Wolf 
was leaving the back yard, I saw. He was lumbering slowly in the direction 
of the swamp. 

I’m going to follow Wolf, I decided. I’m going to prove once and for 
all that he isn’t a killer—or a werewolf. 

I was afraid my parents might hear me if I went to the kitchen door. So 
I crawled out my window. 

The grass was wet from a heavy dew. The air was wet, too, and nearly 
as hot as during the day. My sneakers squeaked and slid on the damp grass 
as I hurried to follow Wolf. 

I stopped at the end of the back yard. I’d lost him. 

I could still hear him somewhere up ahead. I could hear the soft thud 
of his paws on the marshy ground. 



But it was too dark to see him. 

I followed the sound of his footsteps, gazing up at the shifting, 
shadowy clouds. 

I was nearly to the swamp when I heard footsteps behind me. 

With a gasp of fright, I stopped and listened hard. 

Yes. Footsteps. 

Moving rapidly toward me. 



27 


“Hey!” 

I let out a choked cry and spun around. 

At first, all I could see was blackness. “Hey—who’s there?” My voice 
came out in a hushed whisper. 

Will stepped out from the darkness. “Grady—it’s you!” he cried. He 
came closer. He was wearing a dark sweatshirt over black jeans. 

“Will—what are you doing out here?” I asked breathlessly. 

“I heard the howls,” he replied. “I decided to investigate.” 

“Me, too. I’m so glad to see you!” I exclaimed. “We can explore 
together.” 

“I’m glad to see you, too,” he said. “It was so dark, I—I didn’t know it 
was you. I thought—” 

“I’m following Wolf,” I told him. I led the way into the swamp. It 
grew even darker as we made our way under the low trees. 

As we walked, I told Will about the night before, about the murdered 
deer, the paw prints around the deer pen. I told him about how people in 
town were talking. And about how my dad planned to take Wolf away to 
the pound. 

“I know Wolf isn’t the killer,” I told him. “I just know it. But Cassie 
got me so scared with all her werewolf stories, and—” 

“Cassie is a jerk,” Will muttered. He pointed into the weeds. “Look— 
there’s Wolf!” 

I could see his black outline moving steadily through the heavy 
darkness. “I was so stupid. I should have brought a flashlight,” I murmured. 

Wolf disappeared behind the weeds. Will and I followed the sound of 
his footsteps. We walked for several minutes. Suddenly, I realized I could 
no longer hear the dog. 

“Where’s Wolf?” I whispered, my eyes searching the dark bushes and 
low trees. “I don’t want to lose him.” 

“He went this way,” Will called back to me. “Follow me.” 

Our sneakers slid over the damp, marshy ground. I slapped at a 
mosquito on the back of my neck. Too late. I could feel warm blood. 



Deeper into the swamp. Past the bog, eerily silent now. 

“Hey, Will?” 

I stopped—and searched. “Oh.” A soft cry escaped my lips as I 
realized I had lost him. 

Somehow we had gotten separated. 

I heard rustling up ahead. The crack of twigs. The whispering brush of 
weeds being stepped on and pushed out of the way. 

“Will? Is that you?” 

Or was it Wolf? 

“Will?” 

“Where are you?” 

Pale light suddenly washed over me, washed slowly over the ground. 
Glancing up, I saw the heavy clouds pull away. The yellow full moon 
hovered high in the sky. 

As the light slowly swept over the swamp, a low structure came into 
view straight ahead of me. 

At first, I couldn’t figure out what it was. Some kind of gigantic plant? 

No. 

As the moonlight shone down, I realized I was staring at the swamp 
hermit’s shack. 

I stopped, frozen in sudden fear. 

And then the howls began. 

The frightening sound tore through the heavy silence. A horrifying 
wail, so loud, so nearby, rose on the still air, rose and then fell. 

The sound was so terrifying, I raised my hands to cover my ears. 

The swamp hermit! I thought. He is a werewolf! 

I knew he was the werewolf. 

I’ve got to get away from here, I realized. I’ve got to get home. 

I turned away from the small shack. 

My legs were trembling so hard, I didn’t know if I could walk. 

Got to go! Got to go! Got to go! The words repeated in my mind. 

But before I could move, the werewolf burst out from behind a tree— 
and, howling its hideous howl, leapt onto my shoulders and shoved me to 
the ground. 



28 


As the yellow light of the full moon shone down, I gazed into the face of 
the werewolf as it pinned me to the ground. 

Its dark eyes glared out at me from a human face, a human face 
covered in wolf fur. It howled its rage, its animal snout opening wide to 
reveal two gleaming rows of wolf fangs. 

It’s a human wolf! I realized to my terror. A werewolf! 

“Get off!” I shrieked. “Will—get off me!” 

It was Will. The werewolf was Will. 

Even through the thick, matted wolf fur, I could recognize his dark 
features, his small, black eyes, his thick, stubby neck. 

“Will—!” I screamed. 

I struggled to push him away, to squirm out from under. 

But he was too powerful. I couldn’t move. 

“Will —get off!” 

He raised his fur-covered face to the moon and uttered an animal howl. 
Then, snarling out his rage, he lowered his beastly head and dug his fangs 
into my shoulder. 

I let out a shriek of pain. 

Blinding flashes of red filled my eyes. 

I thrust out my hands, kicked my legs—struggled blindly to free 
myself. 

But he had animal strength. He was much too strong for me... too 
strong... . 

The flashing red faded, turned to black. Everything was fading to 
black. I could feel myself sinking, sinking down a black tunnel, sinking 
forever into deep, deep, endlessly deep darkness. 

A loud growl brought me back. 

Bewildered, I gazed up to see Wolf leap onto Will. 

Will uttered a shrill howl of anger and turned to wrestle with the 
snarling dog. 

I watched in stunned disbelief as they scrabbled over the ground, 



biting and clawing, raging at each other, growling and grunting. 

“Will... Will, it was you... it was you all along....” I murmured, 
struggling to my feet. 

I gripped a tree trunk. The ground appeared to be sliding beneath me. 

The two creatures continued to battle, grunting and growling as they 
clawed at each other, wrestling over the wet ground. 

“I knew it wasn’t Wolf,” I muttered aloud. “I knew...” 

And then a deafening high-pitched shriek startled me, and I tumbled to 
my knees. 

I looked up in time to see Will running away, fleeing on all fours 
through the tall weeds. Wolf followed close behind, snapping at Will’s 
ankles, jumping on him, biting and clawing him as they ran. 

Then, I heard Will utter another cry of pain, a wail of defeat. 

As the anguished sound faded, I sank down, down, down into the blue- 
black darkness.

“You have a slight fever,” Mom said. “But you’ll be okay.” 

“Swamp fever,” I murmured weakly. I gazed up at her, trying to focus. 
Her face was blurred, hovering over me in the soft light. 

It took me a long while to realize I was in my own bedroom. “How— 
how did I get here?” I stammered. 

“The swamp hermit—he found you in the swamp and carried you 
home,” Mom said. 

“He did?” I tried to sit up, but my shoulder ached. To my surprise, it 
was tightly bandaged. “The—the werewolf—Will—he bit me,” I said, 
swallowing hard. 

Dad’s face, hovered beside Mom’s. “What are you saying, Grady? 
Why do you keep muttering about a werewolf?” 

I pulled myself up a little and told them the whole story. They listened 
in silence, glancing at each other from time to time as I talked. 

“Will is a werewolf,” I concluded. “He changed. Under the full moon. 
He changed into a wolf, and—” 

“I’m going to check this out right now,” Dad said, staring intently 
down at me. “Your story is crazy, Grady. Just crazy. Maybe it’s the fever. I 
don’t know. But I’m going right over to your friend’s house and see what’s 
what.” 

“Dad—be careful,” I called after him. “Be careful.” 

Dad returned a short while later, a bewildered look on his face. I was sitting 
in the living room, feeling a lot better, a big bowl of popcorn in my lap. 

“There’s no one there,” Dad said, scratching his head. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” Mom asked. 

“The house is empty,” Dad told us. “Deserted. It doesn’t look like 
anyone has lived there in months! ” 

“Wow, Grady. You certainly have strange friends!” Emily exclaimed, 
rolling her eyes. 

“I don’t get it,” Dad said, shaking his head. 

I didn’t, either. But I didn’t care. Will was gone. The werewolf was 



gone for good. 

“So can I keep Wolf?” I asked Dad, climbing up from the chair and 
crossing the room to him. “Wolf saved my life. Can I keep him?” 

Dad stared back at me thoughtfully, but didn’t reply. 

“The swamp hermit told us he saw the dog chase some kind of animal 
away from Grady,” Mom said. 

“Probably a squirrel,” Emily joked. 

“Emily, give me a break,” I groaned. “Wolf really saved my life,” I 
told them. 

“I guess you can keep him,” Dad said reluctantly. 

“YAY!” I thanked him and eagerly made my way to the back yard to 
give Wolf a happy hug. 

That all happened nearly a month ago. 

Since then, Wolf and I have had a wonderful time exploring the 
swamp. I’ve gotten to know just about every inch of Fever Swamp. It’s like 
my second home. 

Sometimes Wolf and I let Cassie come along exploring with us. She’s 
kind of fun, even though she’s always on the lookout for werewolves. I 
really wish she’d just drop the subject. 

I’m standing at my bedroom window now, watching the full moon 
rising over the distant trees. This first full moon in a month makes me think 
of Will. 

Will may be gone, but he changed my life. I know I’ll never forget 

him. 

I can feel the fur sprouting on my face. My snout is expanding, and my 
fangs are sliding out between my dark lips. 

Yes, when he bit me, Will passed the curse on to me. 

But I don’t mind. I’m not upset. 

I mean, with Will out of the way, the swamp is now mine! All mine! 

I’m climbing out of my window now. There’s Wolf waiting for me, 
eager to do some night exploring. 

I drop easily to the ground on all fours. I raise my fur-covered face to 
the moon and utter a long, joyful howl. 

Let’s go, Wolf. Let’s hurry to Fever Swamp. 

I’m ready to hunt. 




YOU CAN’T SCARE ME! 
Goosebumps -15 
R.L. Stine 


1 


The day we decided to scare Courtney was the day of our class field trip. 

Mr. Melvin, our teacher, and Ms. Prince, the other sixth-grade teacher, 
stood counting us as we boarded the yellow school bus. 

Courtney was first in line, of course. Courtney makes sure she is 
always first in line. Her friend Denise boarded right behind her. 

It was a gray day. Dark storm clouds rolled overhead, blocking the 
sun. The guy on the radio said there was a ninety percent chance of rain. 

I didn’t care. I was happy to be getting out of school. 

I pushed my friend Hat into the kid in front of him. His real name is 
Herbie, but everyone calls him Hat. That’s because no one has ever seen 
him without a baseball cap on his head. I’ve known Hat since fourth grade, 
and I don’t think I’ve ever seen his hair. 

The kid in front spun around and shoved Hat back at me. 

“Hey—give me a break!” Hat shouted. He slugged me hard on the 
shoulder. “You made me swallow my gum, Eddie.” 

“Hey, guys, be cool,” Mr. Melvin said, frowning at us. He’s the kind of 
teacher who always says things like “be cool” and tries to act like he’s our 
friend. But he’s a pretty good teacher, anyway. 

And he takes us on a lot of field trips, which is cool. 

“Why are we going to a forest?” Hat grumbled, slipping another piece 
of bubble gum into his mouth. “What are we supposed to look for?” 

“Trees, I guess,” I replied. I didn’t remember why we were going to 
Greene Forest. I just remembered we were supposed to take notes. 

“Eddie, want some bubble gum?” 

I turned around to see my friend Charlene right behind me in line. She 
and my other friend Molly had big gobs of grape gum in their mouths and 
were chewing hard. 

“Molly, how can you chew that stuff with braces?” I asked. 

She opened her mouth in a wide grin, showing me her teeth. “It 
doesn’t stick too much,” she said. 

Molly’s braces are red and blue. She’s always showing them off. I 
don’t know why. 



Molly and Charlene look so much alike, almost like sisters. They both 
have short brown hair and brown eyes. They’re both about my height, five 
two. They both wear faded jeans and big, oversized T-shirts all the time. 
The only difference between Molly and Charlene is that Molly wears 
glasses and has braces, and Charlene doesn’t. 

“I’ll protect you two in the deep, dark forest,” I teased. “You know. In 
case you’re attacked by fleas or something.” 

“Eddie’s a real macho guy,” Hat said, grinning. “He’s real brave.” He 
punched my shoulder. Hard. 

I pretended it didn’t hurt. 

“You both have fleas,” Charlene said. 

“We’ll protect you, Eddie,” Molly offered. “There might be some 
vicious worms there!” 

Hat, Molly, and Charlene burst out laughing. Molly was teasing me 
about the time the four of us went fishing at Muddy Creek, and I had a little 
trouble putting a worm on my hook. 

“I wasn’t afraid of that worm!” I cried angrily. “It was just yucky, 
that’s all.” 

I scowled at Molly, but I wasn’t really angry. I’m used to being teased. 
Kids always make fun of my freckles and my red hair. And my older 
brother, Kevin, calls me Bugs. He says I look just like Bugs Bunny because 
my two front teeth stick out. 

“What’s up, doc? What’s up, doc?” That’s all Kevin ever says to me. 
He and his high school pals think it’s a riot. 

I climbed onto the bus and scrambled past Hat to get a window seat. 
Courtney and Denise had taken the front seat, of course. Courtney was 
brushing her long, blonde hair, using the bus window as a mirror. Denise 
was writing something in her notebook. 

Hat slammed into me, and I stumbled down the aisle. He quickly slid 
into the seat and moved to the window. “Hey—no fair!” I shouted. 

He giggled his high-pitched giggle and grinned at me. Hat is my best 
pal, but I have to admit he’s sort of goofy-looking. I mean, he’s always 
grinning, sort of like Dopey in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. And he 
has really big ears that bend down beneath his baseball cap, sort of doubled 
over. 

He’s a good guy. He really makes Molly, Charlene, and me laugh all 
the time. 

“I get the window going back,” I said, slumping down beside Hat. 
Charlene messed up my hair as she walked past. 

“Why do they call it Greene Forest?” Hat asked, pressing his nose 
against the window, watching it steam up from his breath. “Why not Blue 
Forest or Red Forest?” 

“A guy named Greene used to own it,” I told him. “He gave the land to 
the city when he died.” 

“I knew that,” Hat said. What a liar. 

I spun his cap around till it was backwards. He really hates that. But he 
deserved it for grabbing the window seat. 

A few minutes later, the bus was bouncing toward Greene Forest. A 
few minutes after that, we were piling out of the bus, staring at the tall trees 
that reached up to the dark, cloudy sky. 

“Make two columns on your work sheet,” Ms. Prince was telling 
everyone. “One for wildlife and one for plantlife.” 

“I’m putting you down as plantlife,” I told Charlene. 

She stuck her tongue out at me with the big, purple blob of bubble 
gum on the tip. Hat slapped her on the back really hard, and the wad of 
bubble gum went flying. 

Charlene cried out angrily and tried to slug him, but Hat backed away 
to safety. He was too fast for her. 

The teachers divided us into groups, and we began to explore the 
forest. We followed a narrow dirt path that twisted through the trees. 

It was cooler in the forest, and dark. I wished the sun would come out. 

“What’s that green stuff on that tree?” Hat asked me, pointing. “Is that 
moss? Is moss wildlife or plantlife?” 

“You should know,” I told him. “You have it growing on your back!” 

Molly and Charlene laughed, but Hat didn’t. “Can’t you ever be 
serious?” He scribbled something on his work sheet. 

I glanced down at mine. I hadn’t written anything yet. I mean, I’d only 
seen a bunch of trees and some weeds. Who cared about writing that down? 

“The creatures are hiding,” Ms. Prince was telling the group of kids 
ahead of us. “Search for their hiding places. Look for holes in the ground 
and in trees. Look for hidden nests.” 

I gazed up at the trees above my head. The leaves were too thick to see 

any nests. I was about to tell Hat he should look under some rocks because 
that’s where he came from. But before I could, I heard a hushed cry behind 
us. 

“Ssshhh! Look! A deer!” 

We all turned back to see who had called out. Of course it was 
Courtney. Who else would be the first to spot a deer? 

She and Denise were frozen like statues, staring into a narrow space 
between the trees. Courtney kept raising her finger to her lips, signaling for 
everyone to be silent. 

Hat, Molly, Charlene, and I went running over to see the deer. “I don’t 
see anything,” I said, squinting hard into the trees. 

“It ran away,” Courtney told me. 

“You missed it,” Denise added. I watched her write deer on her work 
sheet under wildlife. She already had four other creatures on her list. I 
didn’t have any. 

“Did you see the sleeping bat?” Courtney asked me. 

“Bat?” I don’t like bats. They’re so ugly. And what if one bites you? 

“It was hanging on that tree,” Courtney said, pointing behind us. “How 
could you miss it?” 

I shrugged. 

“There’s a birch tree,” Denise told Courtney. “And there’s a weeping 
beech tree. Add them to the list.” 

Hat, Molly, and Charlene had moved on along the trail, and I hurried 
to catch up to them. Courtney and Denise were working too hard, in my 
opinion. Field trips are supposed to be for goofing and having fun away 
from school. 

We made our way slowly through the forest. After a while, the sun 
came out and sent shafts of yellow light down through the trees. 

I tried to push Hat into a huge patch of poison ivy. But he dodged 
away from me, and I went sprawling face down in the dirt. 

I was still brushing myself off when I saw the snake. 

Right beside my left sneaker. 

It was bright green, and big. 

I stopped breathing. I stared down at it. 

I had nearly stepped on it. 

As I stared helplessly, it arched its head, opened its jaws, and darted 



forward to bite my leg. 

I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. 



2 


The snake dived toward me. I shut my eyes and waited for the stab of pain. 

“Ohh.” A low, frightened cry escaped my lips. 

I opened my eyes to see Courtney holding up the snake. “Courtney—I 
—I—” I stammered. 

“Eddie, you’re not scared of this, are you?” Courtney demanded, 
raising the snake to my face. Its black eyes stared up at me. It flicked its 
tongue. 

“It’s a harmless green snake, Eddie,” Courtney said. “You can’t be 
afraid of a green snake! ” 

I heard Denise snickering behind me. 

Courtney petted the snake, stroking it, letting it slide through her 
fingers. 

“Uh... I wasn’t really scared,” I muttered. But my voice trembled. I 
could tell Courtney didn’t believe me. 

“A harmless green snake,” she repeated. She set the snake down on the 
ground. 

I jumped back. I thought it was coming for me again. 

But it slid silently into the weeds. 

Hat laughed. A high-pitched, nervous laugh. 

Denise shook her head scornfully. 

“Add that to the list,” Courtney told her. “Green snake. That makes 
seven in the wildlife column.” 

“We should write down chicken,” Denise said, staring at me. “That 
would make eight.” 

“Cluck cluck,” I replied bitterly. I motioned for my friends to follow 
me, and we hurried up the path. We could hear Courtney and Denise both 
laughing. 

“Don’t feel bad,” Hat said to me, patting my shoulder. “Just because 
she made you look like a total jerk.” 

Molly laughed, but Charlene didn’t. “Courtney was just showing off,” 
Charlene said to me. “For a change.” 

“I wish that snake had bitten her perfect nose,” Molly added. “You 



know. Put a little dent in it.” 

“I really wasn’t afraid,” I insisted shrilly. “The snake surprised me, 
that’s all. I knew it was harmless.” 

“Yeah. Right,” Hat replied, rolling his beady little black eyes. I made a 
swipe at his cap but missed. 

“Coming through! Coming through!” Courtney called. She and Denise 
hurried past us, swinging their work sheets in one hand as they passed by. 

Denise turned and hissed at me like a snake. Courtney laughed. 

“I suppose they’ll be teasing me about the green snake for the next 
hundred years,” I said with a sigh. 

“We’ll all tease you about it for a hundred years,” Molly promised. 

I trudged unhappily along the path. Golden sunshine filtered down 
through the trees, but it didn’t brighten my spirits. A cute red-furred squirrel 
scampered across the path. I wasn’t interested. 

My day had been ruined. 

Ruined by Courtney and that stupid green snake. 

I could hear kids up ahead laughing about it. Every time I looked at 
Hat, he grinned at me as if to say, “You really blew it today, Eddie.” 

It’s not a big deal, I kept telling myself. So I got scared of a snake. 
And I had to be rescued by Courtney. So what? 

“Look out, Eddie. There’s a caterpillar. It might bite!” some kid called 
from a clump of tall weeds up ahead. 

“Give me a break!” I cried angrily. 

As I made my way along the path, the forest became a bright green 
blur to me. Other kids were busy adding to the lists on their work sheets. 

But I couldn’t see anything to add. The air became hot and damp. My 
T-shirt stuck to my back. Little white gnats flew around my face. 

I was really glad when the path ended and we stepped out near the 
parking lot. We had made a complete circle. The school bus stood at the 
edge of the grass, its door open invitingly. 

But no one was getting on the bus. 

To my surprise, I saw a big crowd of kids huddled in a circle several 
feet from the bus. They were standing silently, staring straight ahead. 

“What—what’s up?” I called to Charlene, who was hurrying toward 
the silent circle of kids. 


“It’s Courtney!” she called back. 



I began running, too. 

The kids were huddled so silently. No one moved. 
Had something terrible happened to Courtney? 



3 


What happened to her? Did she faint or something? Was she bitten by some 
kind of forest animal? 

I ran across the grass and pushed my way into the circle of kids. 

And I saw Courtney standing in the center of the circle, an excited 
smile on her face. 

I was wrong. Nothing terrible had happened to Courtney. 

She was showing off again. 

She had her hand raised and was showing everyone her open palm. 
Two enormous bumblebees were in her hand, walking across her palm. 

I sucked in my breath and stared along with the others. 

Courtney’s smile grew wider as her eyes landed on me. 

One of the bees had crossed her wrist and was walking down her arm. 
The other bee stood in the center of her palm. 

Mr. Melvin and Ms. Prince stood in the circle across from Courtney. 
They had admiring expressions on their faces. Mr. Melvin was smiling. Ms. 
Prince had her arms crossed tensely in front of her. She looked a little more 
worried than Mr. Melvin. 

“Bees will not sting you unless they are provoked,” Courtney said 
softly. 

“What do they feel like?” a kid asked. 

“They kind of tickle,” Courtney told him. 

Some kids hid their eyes. A few others groaned or shuddered. 

“Get rid of them!” someone urged. 

The bee crawled up Courtney’s arm toward the sleeve of her T-shirt. I 
wondered what she’d do if it crawled under her shirt. 

Would she panic then? 

Would she go totally nuts, screaming and thrashing her arms, trying to 
get it out? 

No. No way. Not Courtney. 

Cool, calm Courtney would never panic. 

The other bee walked slowly across her hand. 



“It tickles. It really does,” Courtney giggled. Her blonde hair gleamed 
in the sunlight. Her blue eyes twinkled excitedly. 

Come on, bee — sting! STING! I urged silently. 

I wondered if anyone else had the same secret wish. 

It was a mean thought, I admit. But Courtney was really asking for it. 

Come on—just one little sting! I begged, concentrating with all my 
might. 

The bee on her arm turned around when it reached the T-shirt sleeve 
and made its way back slowly toward Courtney’s elbow. 

“Bees are really very gentle,” Courtney said softly. 

Both bees were in her palm now. 

Courtney smiled at me. I felt a shiver go down my back. How does she 
do that? I wondered. 

I had to admit to myself that I was afraid of bees. I’d always been 
afraid of them, ever since I’d been stung when I was a little kid. 

“Would anyone else like to try this?” Courtney asked. 

Nervous laughter rose up from the circle. No one was crazy enough to 
volunteer. 

“Here, Eddie—catch!” Courtney cried. 

And before I could move or shout or duck or do anything —she pulled 
back her hand and tossed both bees at me! 



4 


I screamed and stepped back. 

I heard loud gasps all around. 

One of the bees hit my shoulder and dropped to the grass. 

The other bee fluttered onto the front of Hat’s shirt and stuck there. 

“Get it off! Get it off!” Hat screamed. He shook his shirt with both 
hands and did a wild, frightened dance. 

Some kids were screaming. But most everyone was laughing 
uproariously. 

I had my eye on the bee on the grass. It buzzed loudly off the ground 
and made a dive for my face. 

“Whoa!” I screamed and dropped to my knees, flailing my hands 
above my head. 

“I think it’s time to get back to school,” I heard Mr. Melvin say over 
the laughter of the other kids. 

Courtney flashed me a smug grin as I walked past her down the aisle 
on the bus. I kept my eyes straight ahead and walked faster, ignoring her. 

Some kids were making buzzing bee sounds. Others were hissing like 
snakes. Everyone thought it was a total riot that Hat and I had acted like 
such chickens. 

I slumped down into the very last seat with a sigh. Hat dropped beside 
me and pulled his cap down over his eyes. 

The seat stretched all the way across the back of the bus. Molly and 
Charlene joined us. Charlene was chewing her bubble gum furiously. Molly 
was trying to unstick her gum from her braces. 

None of us said a word until the bus pulled away. 

Then we started to grumble in low voices about Courtney and what a 
show-off she was. “She just thinks she’s the greatest,” Hat muttered 
unhappily. 

“She acts as if she isn’t afraid of anything,” Charlene said. “Like she’s 
Superwoman or something.” 

“Throwing those bees at Eddie was a mean joke,” Molly added, still 
struggling to unstick the gum from her braces. 



“She knows what a chicken Eddie is,” Hat said. “She knew he’d 
scream and carry on like a jerk.” 

“Well, so did you!” I cried, not meaning to sound so babyish. 

“Hey, I’m on your side!” Hat insisted, giving me a shove. 

I shoved him back. I was really angry. Mostly with myself, I guess. 

“There’s got to be something that Courtney is afraid of,” Charlene said 
thoughtfully. 

The bus stopped at a red light. I glanced out the window and saw that 
we were at the woods that led to Muddy Creek. “Maybe she’s afraid of the 
Mud Monsters,” I suggested. 

My three friends laughed bitterly. “No way,” Charlene said. “No one 
really believes in the Mud Monsters anymore. That’s a stupid old fairy tale. 
No way Courtney would be afraid of them.” 

There’s a legend in our town that the Mud Monsters live under the 
muddy banks of the creek. And sometimes when the moon is full, the Mud 
Monsters rise up from the creek bed, all dripping with mud, and look for 
victims to pull down in the mud with them. 

It’s a good story. I used to believe it when I was a little kid. My 
brother, Kevin, always took me into the woods there. He would tell me 
about the Mud Monsters rising up. Then he’d start to point and tremble and 
say that he saw them. I tried not to get scared. But I couldn’t help it. I 
always started screaming and running for my life! 

“Is your brother still making that movie about the Mud Monsters?” 
Hat asked. 

I nodded. “Yeah. You should see the disgusting costumes he and his 
friends cooked up. They’re really gross.” 

Kevin and some of his friends were making a home video for one of 
their high school courses. It was a horror movie called The Mud Monsters 
of Muddy Creek. 

I begged him to let me be in it. But he said he couldn’t take the risk. 
“What if the real Mud Monsters rose up and came after you?” he asked, 
grinning at me. 

I tried to explain that I was too old, that he couldn’t scare me with that 
stuff anymore. But Kevin still wouldn’t let me be in the video. 

The bus started with a jolt. I glanced up to the front and saw Courtney 
and Denise staring back at me, laughing. 



I turned to my friends. “We’ve got to find a way to scare Courtney,” I 
said heatedly. “We’ve got to!” 

“Eddie’s right,” Hat quickly agreed. “We’ve got to find a way to scare 
Courtney and embarrass her in front of a whole bunch of kids. Otherwise, 
she’ll never let us forget today.” 

“But she’s so brave, so totally fearless,” Charlene said, shaking her 
head. “What could we possibly do to frighten her?” 

We all moaned quietly, shaking our heads, thinking hard. 

Then I saw an evil smile break across Molly’s face. She pushed her 
glasses up on her nose. Behind them, her brown eyes sparkled with 
excitement. “I think I have an idea,” she whispered.

“My brother has a disgusting rubber snake,” Molly whispered. Her excited 
grin grew wider. 

The four of us huddled together on the edge of the back seat. Every 
time the bus bounced, we nearly fell to the floor. 

“Courtney isn’t afraid of snakes,” Hat interrupted. “She likes to pet 
them. Remember?” 

“That was a stupid green snake,” Molly whispered. “My brother’s 
mbber snake is big and black. The mouth is open. It’s got these huge, 
pointy white fangs. It’s got a fierce expression on its face, and—” 

“Does it look real or does it look fake?” I asked. 

The bus hit a hard bump. We all bounced a foot straight up. 

“It looks real,” Molly replied, her eyes flashing behind her glasses. 
“And it feels warm and kind of sticky.” 

“Yuck!” Charlene exclaimed, making a face. 

“He’s scared me with it a dozen times,” Molly confessed. “It’s so real 
and disgusting, I’m fooled by it every time. Once when I reached under my 
pillow in the middle of the night and felt it there, I screamed for at least an 
hour. No one could get me to stop.” 

“Great!” Hat declared. 

I still had my doubts. “You really think it’ll make Courtney scream?” 

Molly nodded. “She’ll freak. She’ll totally freak. This rubber snake is 
ugly enough to scare a real snake!” 

We all laughed loudly. Some kids in the front turned to see what was 
so funny. I could see Courtney and Denise in the front seat, writing in their 
notebooks. They were probably copying their work sheet lists over. They 
both had to be perfect students in every way. 

“I can’t wait to scare Courtney,” I said as the bus pulled up to our 
school. “You sure you can get this snake from your brother, Molly?” 

Molly grinned at me. “I know which drawer he keeps it in. I’ll just 
borrow it.” 

“But what are we going to do with it?” Charlene demanded. “How are 
we going to scare Courtney with it? Where are we going to hide it?” 



“In her lunch bag, of course,” Molly replied. 

The four of us climbed off the bus with big smiles on our faces. 


* * * 


The lunch bags were kept on a low bookshelf in the back of our classroom. 
My class always eats lunch right in our classroom. Our school is very small 
so a cafeteria was never built. Courtney’s lunch was always easy to spot. It 
was the biggest one on the shelf. 

Her mother always packed her two sandwiches and two boxes of juice. 
Plus a bag of potato chips and an apple, some string cheese, and usually a 
fruit rollup or two. 

I don’t know why Courtney’s mom gave her such big lunches. There 
was no way Courtney could eat it all. She became a big hero at lunchtime 
because she shared a lot of it with kids who had crummy lunches. 

The next morning, I got to school a little late. The lunch bags were 
already spread out on the low shelf. I could see Courtney’s overstuffed 
brown paper bag at the end. 

I studied Courtney’s lunch bag as I set mine down at the other end. 
Had Molly succeeded in her mission? Had she stuffed the rubber snake into 
the bag? 

I couldn’t tell by looking at the bag. But I could tell by looking at 
Molly. Her face was bright red, and she kept darting nervous glances at me. 

Yes. 

Molly had succeeded. 

Now we just had to survive the three and a half hours until lunchtime. 

How would I be able to concentrate on anything? I kept turning around 
in my seat and glancing back at Courtney’s bulging lunch bag. 

I kept imagining what was about to happen. I pictured the wonderful 
scene again and again. I saw Courtney sitting across the table from Denise, 
as she always did. I saw her chattering away. I saw her reach into the brown 
paper bag.... 

I saw the horrified look on Courtney’s face. I imagined her scream. I 
imagined the snake popping up from the bag, its fangs bared, its eyes 
glowing like hot coals. 

I pictured Courtney shrieking in fright and everyone else laughing at 



her, making fun of her. I imagined myself walking over casually and 
picking up the snake. “Why, it’s only rubber, Courtney,” I’d say, holding it 
up high so everyone could see. “You shouldn’t be afraid of rubber snakes. 
They’re harmless. Perfectly harmless!” 

What a victory! 

All morning long, Hat, Molly, Charlene, and I kept grinning at each 
other, casting secret glances back and forth. I don’t think we heard a single 
word Mr. Melvin said. 

I couldn’t tell you what spelling words were written on the blackboard. 
And I couldn’t tell you what kind of math was on my review sheet. It was 
just a blur of numbers and squiggly signs to me. 

My three friends and I spent most of the morning staring eagerly at the 
clock. Finally, lunchtime rolled around. 

We hung back, all four of us. We waited at our tables and watched 
Courtney and Denise walk together to the back of the room to get their 
lunches. 

We watched Courtney bend down in front of the bookshelf. First she 
handed Denise’s lunch up to her. Then she picked up her own bag. 

The two of them made their way to the table where they always sat. 
They pulled out chairs and sat down across from each other. 

This is it, I thought, holding my breath. 

This is the big moment. 



6 


My friends and I hurried to get our lunches. We didn’t want anyone to 
wonder why we were just standing there staring at Courtney. 

We sat down at our usual table. I kept my eyes glued on Courtney. I 
was so nervous and eager, I thought I would burst! 

Courtney started to open her lunch bag. 

Just then, everyone heard a low groan from the back of the room. It 
was Mr. Melvin. “Oh, no,” he cried. “I forgot my lunch today.” 

“That’s no problem,” Courtney called back to him. 

Mr. Melvin walked over to her table. He leaned down and started 
talking to her. I couldn’t hear what they were saying. It’s always really 
noisy in the room at lunchtime with everyone talking and laughing and 
crinkling their lunch bags and unwrapping their food. 

Hat, Molly, Charlene, and I were the only ones in the room who were 
being quiet. We watched as Courtney and Mr. Melvin continued to talk. 

“What are they talking about?” Hat whispered to me. “Why doesn’t he 
let her open her bag?” 

I shrugged, keeping my eyes on Courtney. She had a thoughtful 
expression on her face. Then she smiled up at him. 

Then she handed him her lunch bag. 

“No, really, it’s fine,” Courtney said to Mr. Melvin. “You can have 
some of my lunch. You know my mom always packs too much.” 

“Oh, no,” I groaned. I suddenly felt sick. 

“Should we warn him?” Hat asked me. 

Too late. 

Still standing beside Courtney’s table, Mr. Melvin opened the bag and 
reached inside. His eyes narrowed in bewilderment. 

Then he let out a high-pitched, startled cry as he pulled the big, black 
snake out. 

The lunch bag dropped to the floor. The rubber snake wriggled briefly 
in his hand. 

Molly was right. It was very real-looking. 

Mr. Melvin let out another cry, and the snake dropped to the floor. 



The room filled with startled shrieks and cries. 

Courtney leapt up from her seat. She gave Mr. Melvin a gentle shove 
to move him out of the way. Then she began stomping on the snake. Fierce, 
hard stomps. 

Heroic stomps. 

A few seconds later, she picked the snake up and flashed Mr. Melvin a 
triumphant grin. The snake was in two pieces. She had stomped off its head. 
“My brother is going to kill me!” Molly moaned. 

“Well, at least we scared Mr. Melvin,” Charlene said after school. Charlene 
always tries to look on the bright side. 

“I can’t believe he spent the rest of the afternoon trying to find out 
who put the snake in the bag,” Hat exclaimed. 

“Courtney kept looking over at us,” I said. “Do you think she 
suspected us?” 

“Probably,” Hat replied. “I’m just glad to get out of there.” 

“Mr. Melvin has a really funny scream,” Charlene remarked. 

Molly didn’t say a word. I guessed she was thinking about what her 
brother would do to her when he discovered his rubber snake was gone. 

We were walking to my house. We had all agreed to hold a meeting 
and try to come up with a better plan for scaring Courtney. 

It was a beautiful, warm day. It had been raining all week. This was the 
rainy season in southern California. But today the sun was bright yellow in 
a clear, smogless sky. 

Everyone was thinking about how we almost got caught—and how we 
failed at frightening Courtney. 

We failed. And Courtney was a hero once again. 

“The rubber snake was a bad idea,” Hat murmured as we crossed the 
street onto my block. 

“Tell us about it,” Molly grumbled, rolling her eyes. 

“Courtney will never fall for a fake,” Hat continued. “We need 
something real to scare Courtney. Something alive.” 

“Huh? Something alive?” I asked. 

Hat started to reply—but a woman’s voice interrupted him. 

I turned to see Mrs. Rudolph, one of our neighbors, running toward us. 
Her blonde hair was all wild, and she had a very troubled expression on her 



“Eddie, please—you’ve got to help me!” she cried. 


face. 



7 


I felt a cold chill run down my back. Mrs. Rudolph looked so frightened. 

“What’s w-wrong?” I stammered. 

She pointed up to the sky. “Can you help me?” 

“Huh?” I followed her gaze. It took me a while to realize she was 
pointing up to a tree branch, not to the sky. 

“It’s Muttly, my cat,” Mrs. Rudolph said, shielding her eyes from the 
sun with one hand, still pointing with the other. 

“I see him,” Hat said. “On that branch. The bent one.” 

“I don’t know how he got out of the house,” Mrs. Rudolph said. “He 
never climbs trees. Somehow he got up there, and he can’t get down.” 

I stared up into the thick leaves. Yep. There was Muttly. Pretty high 
up. Making frightened yowling sounds and pawing at the slender tree 
branch. 

We all stood staring up at the frightened cat. 

Suddenly I felt Mrs. Rudolph’s hand on my shoulder. “Can you climb 
up and get him, Eddie?” 

I swallowed hard. I’m not the best tree climber in the world. In fact, I 
hate climbing trees. I always cut my hands on the bark or scrape the skin 
off my stomach or something. 

“Please hurry,” Mrs. Rudolph pleaded. “Muttly’s so scared. He—he’s 
going to fall.” 

So what if he falls! Aren’t cats supposed to have nine lives? 

That’s what I thought. But I didn’t say that to Mrs. Rudolph. 

Instead, I stammered something about how high up he was. 

“You’re good at climbing trees, aren’t you?” Mrs. Rudolph said. “I 
mean, all boys your age climb trees, don’t they?” Her eyes studied me. She 
had a strong look of disapproval on her face. 

She thinks I’m a chicken, I realized. 

If I don’t climb the tree and rescue her stupid cat, she’ll tell my mom 
what a weakling I am. The word will be out all over the neighborhood: Mrs. 
Rudolph asked Eddie for help, and he just stood there like a coward, 
making lame excuses. 



“I’m a little afraid of heights,” I confessed. 

“Go ahead, Eddie,” Hat urged. “You can do it.” Some friend. 

Above us, the cat yowled loudly. He sounded like a baby crying. His 
tail stood stiffly straight up in the air. 

“You can do it, Eddie,” Charlene said, staring up at the cat. 

“Please hurry,” Mrs. Rudolph pleaded. “My kids will be heartbroken if 
anything happens to Muttly.” 

I hesitated, gazing up the long, rough-barked trunk. 

The cat yowled again. 

I saw the branch tremble. I saw the cat’s legs scrabble frantically as he 
lost his grip. 

Then I heard the cat yelp as he started to fall. 



8 


We all screamed. 

The branch bobbed up and down. The cat clung to the branch with his 
front paws. Its back legs kicked the air furiously. 

“Oh no oh no oh no!” Mrs. Rudolph chanted, covering her eyes with 
one hand. 

The cat yowled in terror. 

Somehow he managed to pull himself back up onto the shaking tree 
branch. Then he cried again, frightened, human-sounding cries. 

Mrs. Rudolph lowered her hand from her eyes. She stared disgustedly 
at me. “I guess I’d better call the fire department.” 

I knew I should grab onto the tree trunk and pull myself up. But I 
really am afraid of heights. I’m just not a good climber. 

With an exasperated sigh, Mrs. Rudolph turned and started jogging to 
her house. She stopped when we heard a girl’s voice cry out. 

“Hey—what’s the problem?” 

Courtney rolled onto the sidewalk on her sleek red racing bike. She 
hopped off and let the bike fall to the ground. She was wearing white denim 
overalls over a bright yellow T-shirt. 

“What’s going on, guys?” she asked, hurrying up to us. 

“My cat—” Mrs. Rudolph said, pointing up to the tree. 

The cat yowled in panic. 

Courtney gazed up to the bobbing branch. 

“I’ll get him down,” Courtney said. She grabbed the tree trunk and 
began shinnying up. 

The cat meowed and nearly slipped again. 

Courtney climbed quickly, easily, wrapping her legs around the trunk, 
pulling herself up with both hands. 

A few seconds later, she made her way onto the branch, grabbed the 
cat around the stomach with one hand, and pulled him close to her body. 
Then she skillfully lowered herself to the ground. 

“Here’s the poor kitty,” Courtney said, smoothing the cat’s fur, petting 
it gently. She handed him to Mrs. Rudolph. Courtney’s white denims and 



yellow T-shirt were smeared with dirt and bits of dark bark. She had pieces 
of green leaves in her blonde hair. 

“Oh, thank you,” Mrs. Rudolph gushed, wrapping the still mewing cat 
in her arms. “Thank you so much, dear. You were so wonderful.” 

Courtney brushed some of the dirt off her overalls. “I like climbing 
trees,” she told Mrs. Rudolph. “It’s really fun.” 

Mrs. Rudolph turned her gaze to me, and her smile quickly faded. “I’m 
glad someone in this neighborhood is brave,” she said, making a disgusted 
face. She thanked Courtney again, then turned and carried the cat into the 
house. 

I felt so bad. I wanted to sink into the ground with the worms. I wanted 
to disappear and never be seen again. 

But there I was, standing with my hands shoved in my jeans pockets. 

And there was Courtney, grinning at me. Gloating. Rubbing it in with 
that smug look on her face. 

Hat, Molly, and Charlene didn’t say a word. When I looked at them, 
they avoided my eyes. I knew they were embarrassed for me. And angry 
that Courtney had made us all look bad again. 

Courtney picked up her bike and started walking it away. She threw 
her leg over the bar and climbed on to the seat. Then she suddenly turned 
back to me. 

“Hey, Eddie—was it you who put that dumb snake in my lunch?” 

“Of course not!” I exclaimed. I kicked the grass with one sneaker. 

She continued to stare at me, her blue eyes studying my face. 

I knew I was blushing. I could feel my cheeks grow hot. But there was 
nothing I could do about it. 

“I thought maybe it was you,” Courtney said, tossing her hair behind 
her shoulder. “I thought maybe you were trying to pay me back. You know. 
For the green snake thing.” 

“No way,” I muttered. “No way, Courtney.” 

My three friends shifted uncomfortably. Hat started humming some 
song. 

Finally, Courtney raised her feet to the pedals and rode off down the 
street. 

“We’ve got to find a way to scare her,” I said through clenched teeth as 
soon as she had ridden out of sight. “We’ve just got to!” 



“How about a live tarantula down her back?” Hat suggested. 



9 


The plan was simple. 

Mr. Dollinger, the science teacher, kept two tarantulas in a cage in the 
second-floor science lab. 

Hat and I would sneak into the science lab after school on Thursday. 
We would borrow one of the tarantulas and hide it in my locker overnight. 

The next morning, we all had gym right after morning meeting. There 
is a narrow balcony over the gym floor where equipment is stored. Hat and 
I would sneak up onto the balcony with the tarantula. 

Then Molly and Charlene would start talking to Courtney and get her 
to stand under the balcony. When Courtney was in position under the 
balcony, one of us would drop the tarantula onto Courtney’s head. 

Then she’d scream and howl, and the tarantula would get tangled in 
her hair, and she wouldn’t be able to get it out, so she’d scream some more 
and go totally ballistic, and we’d all have a good laugh. 

A simple plan. 

And one we were sure would work. 

What could go wrong? 

Thursday after school, Molly and Charlene wished us luck. Hat and I went 
into the shop room and pretended to be working on our wood projects. 
Actually, we were waiting for all the kids to leave the school building. 

Pretty soon it was silent out in the hall. I poked my head out the shop 
door. Empty. 

“Okay, Hat,” I whispered, motioning for him to follow me. “Let’s get 
this over with.” 

We crept out into the hall. Our shoes scraped noisily against the hard 
tile floor. The halls at school are kind of creepy when everyone has left and 
it’s so quiet. 

We passed by the teachers’ lounge near the front stairway. The door 
was open a crack, and I could hear some kind of teachers’ meeting going 
on. 

That’s great, I told myself. If the teachers are all meeting downstairs, 



we will have the science lab to ourselves. 

Hat and I hurried up the front stairs. We leaned on the banister and 
tried to move as silently as we could. 

The science lab is at the end of the hall on the second floor. We passed 
by a couple of eighth graders we didn’t know. But we didn’t see anyone 
else. There didn’t seem to be any teachers up there. They were probably all 
at the meeting. 

Hat and I peeked into the lab. Late afternoon sunlight poured in 
through the windows. We had to squint down the long rows of lab tables. 

“Mr. Dollinger?” I called. I just wanted to make sure he wasn’t there. 

No reply. 

We both tried to squeeze through the door at the same time, but we 
didn’t fit. Hat laughed. His nervous, high-pitched giggle. I raised a finger to 
my lips, signaling for him to be quiet. I didn’t want anyone to hear us. 

Hat followed me down the center aisle of the long room. My heart 
began to thud loudly in my chest. My eyes darted around the room. 

The sunlight seemed to grow even brighter. The watercolor paintings 
of the rain forest we had all made were hanging on the wall behind Mr. 
Dollinger’s desk. Water dripped in one of the lab sinks to our right. Plonk. 
Plonk. Plonk. 

The door to the tall metal supply cabinet beside Mr. Dollinger’s desk 
had been left open. I pointed it out to Hat. “That probably means he’s 
coming back up here after the teachers’ meeting,” I whispered. 

Mr. Dollinger is a neat freak. He wouldn’t leave a supply closet open 
overnight. 

Hat gave me a shove. “We’d better hurry.” 

“Don’t push me,” I grumbled. 

We made our way to the tarantula cage, on a metal table against the 
wall. It was actually a rectangular, plywood box with a wire mesh top. 

A loud crash made me stop a few feet from the cage. I gasped and 
turned to Hat. “What was that?” 

The sound repeated. We both realized it was a Venetian blind, blown 
by the wind, banging against the open window behind us. 

I breathed a long sigh of relief. I stared at Hat and he stared at me. He 
nervously adjusted his baseball cap over his forehead. “Eddie, maybe this 
isn’t such a good idea,” he whispered. “Maybe we should get out of here.” 



I was tempted to agree with Hat and run out the door as fast as I could. 
But then I remembered Courtney’s smug smile as she climbed down from 
the tree with the cat. “Let’s stick to the plan,” I said. 

I really wanted to scare Courtney. More than anything else in the 
world. 

Hat and I peered down through the wire mesh at the two tarantulas. 
The bigger one was crawling along one end of the cage. The smaller, 
browner one was sitting like a lump at the other end. 

“Yuck,” I said in a low voice. “They really are gross.” 

Their legs were all hairy and prickly-looking. Their bodies looked like 
disgusting brown hairy sacks. 

“Let’s take the big one,” Hat urged, reaching for the lid. A grin spread 
across his face. “It’ll make a nice plop when it lands on Courtney’s head.” 

We both laughed. Hat made some funny plopping sounds. 

He lifted up the wire mesh top of the cage. He reached a hand in to 
grab the bigger tarantula. Then he suddenly stopped, and his grin faded. 

“We’ve got a little problem,” he said. 

“Huh? What?” I glanced nervously back to the doorway. No one there. 

“What are we going to put it in?” Hat demanded. 

My mouth dropped open. “Oh.” 

“We forgot to bring something to put it in,” Hat said. He lowered the 
top of the cage. Both tarantulas were crawling slowly toward each other 
now. 

“Yeah. Well, we need a bag or something,” I said. My eyes searched 
the tabletops. 

“A bag isn’t any good,” Hat replied, frowning. “Tarantulas can tear 
right through a bag.” 

“Oh, yeah. You’re right.” 

“Why didn’t we think of this before?” Hat demanded. “Why were we 
so stupid? What did we think we were doing? You can’t just put a tarantula 
in your backpack and carry it around!” 

“Calm down,” I said, motioning for him to lower his voice. I could see 
he was starting to panic. “There must be something to keep a tarantula in up 
here.” 

“This is really stupid,” he grumbled. “Did you think I was going to 
keep it in my pocket?” 



“Wait,” I told him. I hurried over to the next table and picked up a 
plastic container. It was the size of a cottage cheese container and had a 
plastic top. “This is perfect,” I whispered, holding it up to show him. “HI 
just poke holes in the top.” 

“Hurry,” Hat urged. He pulled off his cap and scratched his dark hair. 

I poked several air holes in the lid with a pencil. Then I carried the 
plastic container over to the cage. “Here,” I said, handing it to him. 

“You have to hold it,” Hat told me. “I can’t hold the container and pick 
up the tarantula.” 

“Oh,” I replied unhappily. I didn’t want to be that close to the 
tarantula. 

My hand started shaking a little. But I held the container close to the 
cage, ready to snap the lid over it as soon as Hat dropped one of the ugly 
creatures inside. 

He pulled up the lid and reached into the cage. Hat was really brave. 
He wrapped his hand around the bigger one’s body and lifted it up easily. 
Hat didn’t even hesitate or make a disgusted face. 

I was impressed. 

I nearly dropped the plastic container when he lowered the tarantula 
inside. My hand was really shaking. But I managed to hold on. 

The tarantula began flopping around frantically, shooting its legs out, 
slipping and sliding on the slippery plastic surface. 

“He doesn’t like it in there,” I said in a trembling voice. 

“Too bad,” Hat replied, closing the wire mesh cage lid. “Quick, Eddie 
—put the lid on the container.” 

I scrambled to clamp the lid on. 

I almost had it in place when I heard footsteps outside the door. And 
voices. 

Hat and I both gasped as we realized Mr. Dollinger was about to walk 
in. 



10 


A feeble croak escaped my lips. The bright sunlight suddenly glared white. 
I felt the floor sway. 

I could feel my panic weigh me down. I suddenly felt as if I weighed a 
thousand pounds. 

I could hear Mr. Dollinger talking to another teacher right outside the 
science lab door. In another few seconds, he’d step inside, and... and.... 

“Quick—duck under the table!” Hat whispered, his eyes wide with 
fright beneath his cap. 

I started to follow him under the table. But I realized it wasn’t a good 
hiding place at all. Mr. Dollinger would see us as soon as he went to his 
desk. 

“No—no good!” I croaked. “No good. Uh...” 

My eyes flashed around the room. Where could we hide? Where? 

“The supply cabinet!” I cried. I grabbed Hat’s arm and pulled him with 
me. 

The tall metal cabinet was wide enough to hide both of us. 

Could we get into it in time? 

We scrambled inside, pushing each other forward. 

I pulled the door closed. It clicked shut just as Mr. Dollinger entered 
the room. 

Hat and I stood trembling in the darkness of the cabinet, listening to 
his footsteps approach. I gripped the tarantula container tightly in one hand. 

Mr. Dollinger was softly humming a tune. I heard him stop right in 
front of the supply cabinet. 

My heart was pounding so loud, I wondered if the teacher could hear it 
through the cabinet door. 

I shifted my weight and bumped into Hat. There wasn’t another inch of 
space in there. I could hear Hat’s shallow breathing. I could tell he was as 
scared as I was. 

What if Mr. Dollinger decided to open the cabinet door? 

Please, please—just turn out the lights and go home, I pleaded silently. 

I could hear him shuffling papers on his desk. I heard the desk drawer 



open and shut. I heard a book slam shut. More footsteps. Water running in 
one of the sinks. 

He turned off the water. He was still humming softly to himself. More 
footsteps. The click of the light switch. 

Then silence. 

I struggled to hear over my pounding heartbeat. Silence. No humming. 
No footsteps. 

Hat and I stood frozen in the darkness, listening hard. “He—he’s 
gone,” I stammered finally. “He left, Hat.” 

“Phewwww!” Hat sighed loudly. 

“Let’s get out of here!” I cried. I reached for the latch. 

My hand fumbled around in the darkness, sweeping over the metal 
door. I located a slender metal bar and pulled up on it. It didn’t budge. 

“Hey—” I cried out. I moved my hand slowly up the door, trying to 
find a latch or release. 

“Hurry up. Open the cabinet door,” Hat urged. “It’s getting hot in 
here.” 

“I know,” I replied tensely. “I—I can’t find anything.” 

“Let me try,” Hat said impatiently. He pushed my hand away and 
began fumbling with the metal bar. 

“There’s got to be a latch or something,” I said shrilly. 

“Very helpful,” Hat grumbled. He began pounding on the door with his 
open hand. 

I grabbed his arm. “Stop. That won’t open it. And someone will hear 
you.” 

“You try again,” he ordered. His voice sounded really tiny and afraid. 

I swallowed hard. I suddenly had a heavy lump in my throat. It felt as 
if my heart had leapt up into my neck. 

I fumbled frantically with everything I could grab hold of. But I 
couldn’t find anything that would open the door. 

“I give up. We—we’re locked in, Hat,” I stammered. 

“I don’t believe it,” he muttered. 

The container started to slip out of my hand. I grabbed it with both 
hands—and made a startling discovery. 

The lid had come off. 

“Oh, no,” I murmured. 



“What now?” Hat demanded. 

Taking a deep breath, I shook the container. 

It was empty. No tarantula. 

I tried to tell Hat that the tarantula had escaped, but my voice caught in 
my throat. I let out a choking sound. 

And then I felt a prickling on my leg just above my sock. 

And then another prickling, like a pinprick, a little higher up. 

“Hat—the tarantula—” I managed to croak. “It—it’s crawling up my 

leg.” 



11 


The pinpricks moved a little higher on my leg. 

I could feel the tarantula’s warm, hairy body rub against my skin. 

“It—it’s going to b-bite me,” I stuttered. “I know it is.” 

“Don’t move,” Hat advised, sounding even more frightened than me. 
“Just don’t move.” 

The creature’s legs dug into my skin, like sharp needles. 

“I—I have to get out of here!” I screamed. Without thinking about it, I 
lowered my shoulder and heaved all my weight against the cabinet door. 

With a loud pop, it swung open. 

A startled cry escaped my lips as I tumbled out. I landed hard on my 
side, and the empty plastic container rolled across the room. 

Breathing hard, I scrambled to my feet and began furiously kicking 
and shaking my leg. 

The tarantula dropped to the floor and immediately began scrabbling 
across the linoleum. “Catch it! Catch it!” I shrieked. 

Hat dove out of the cabinet and lurched after the tarantula. 

I grabbed up the container and hurried over to him. Hat lifted the 
tarantula high in the air. Its hairy legs kicked and squirmed, but Hat didn’t 
let go. 

He plopped the ugly thing into the container. “Put the lid on tight this 
time,” he warned. 

“Don’t worry,” I moaned. My hands were shaking. But I clamped the 
lid on tightly, then checked and rechecked it three times. 

A short while later, Hat and I were heading downstairs to deposit the 
tarantula in my locker for safekeeping. I could still feel the itchy pinpricks 
on my leg, even though I knew the tarantula hadn’t bitten me. 

“Wow. That was scary!” Hat declared. “That was really scary.” 

“It just means that the rest of the plan will go perfectly,” I assured him. 

A little before nine the next morning, Hat and I were hiding again. This 
time we were hiding on the narrow balcony that overlooks the gym. 

While everyone else in our class changed into their gym shorts and 



sweats and stuff, Hat and I sneaked out of the boys’ locker room. Hat hid 
the tarantula container under his sweatshirt, and we hurried up to the 
balcony. 

The four of us had been calling each other for most of the night, 
getting the plan straight. It was a very simple plan, actually. 

All Molly and Charlene had to do was get Courtney to stand under the 
balcony. Then Hat would drop the tarantula into her hair, and we’d all 
watch her scream and cry and carry on, and make a total fool of herself. 

Simple. 

“What if Courtney doesn’t get upset?” Molly had asked me on the 
phone. “What if she just plucks it out of her hair and calmly asks if anyone 
has lost a tarantula?” 

“That’s impossible,” I had replied. “Courtney is calm—but she isn’t 
that calm! She’s got to scream and go wild with a tarantula in her hair. If 
she doesn’t, she’s not human. She’s a statue or something.” 

“Ready, Hat?” I asked, peering over the side of the balcony. 

He nodded solemnly, his eyes on the volleyball nets below. 

He carefully pulled the lid off the container. The tarantula reached up 
two legs as if to grab him. 

I heard voices down below. A few girls had wandered out of their 
locker room onto the floor. One of them picked up a volleyball and took a 
jump shot at the basket. The ball hit the rim and bounced off. 

“Get down. They can see you,” Hat whispered. 

I lowered my head. It was hot up on the balcony, hotter than down on 
the gym floor, and I started to sweat. 

We were both on our knees. Hat was holding the tarantula container in 
front of him with both hands. 

I could hear more voices down below. Several boys had come out and 
were dribbling a volleyball up and down the floor, passing it off to one 
another. 

“Do you see Courtney?” Hat whispered. 

I raised myself a little higher and peered down. “Yes!” 

Molly and Charlene had Courtney between them. Both of them were 
talking excitedly at the same time. I couldn’t hear what they were talking 
about. 

Courtney was shaking her head. I saw her laugh, then shake her head 



some more. She was wearing a loose-fitting purple T-shirt, and white shorts 
over purple tights. Her blonde hair was tied behind her in a loose ponytail. 

A perfect target, I thought gleefully. I grinned at Hat. I had a good 
feeling about this. A very good feeling. 

Raising my eyes beyond the volleyball nets, I saw that Mr. Russo, the 
gym teacher, was talking to another teacher at the door. 

Good, I thought. We don’t want Mr. Russo blowing the whistle and 
starting the volleyball game until we take care of Courtney. 

Molly and Charlene, meanwhile, still had Courtney between them. 
They were still chatting away. As they talked, they kept backing up, 
backing up, until they were almost in position. 

“Just a few more feet and Courtney will be under the balcony,” I 
whispered to Hat. “It’s happening, Hat. It’s really happening.” 

I was so excited, I felt like I was about to burst. Beads of sweat rolled 
down my forehead and into my eyes. I wiped it with the sleeve of my T- 
shirt and peered down. 

Yes! 

Molly and Charlene had done it. They had backed Courtney under the 
balcony. The three of them stood right beneath us. 

Perfect! 

“Hat—do it!” I whispered. 

Hat didn’t hesitate. Not for a second. This was too perfect. Too 
perfect! 

His eyes on the three girls directly below, he reached into the container 
and picked up the hairy tarantula. 

Then he raised himself up a little higher over the balcony edge, held 
the tarantula over the side, took careful aim—and let it drop. 



12 


Hat and I both leaned over the balcony and watched the tarantula drop. 

And we both cried out in horror when it landed with a sick plop in 
Molly’s hair. 

“Hat—you missed!” I screamed. 

But Molly was screaming a lot louder. Her face was as red as a tomato, 
and her eyes were bulging out of her head. She was shrieking at the top of 
her lungs and doing a strange dance, hopping wildly up and down while her 
hands thrashed the air. 

A lot of kids were running over with startled and bewildered 
expressions. “What’s wrong with Molly?” someone screamed. 

“Why is she doing that?” 

“What happened to her?” 

Staring down, I leaned so far over the balcony, I nearly dropped like 
the tarantula. 

Poor Molly was tearing at her hair now, still shrieking and hopping 
around. 

I cried out in relief as she finally managed to pull the tarantula from 
her dark hair. She juggled it in her hand, nearly dropping it. Then, still 
screaming, she tossed it to Charlene! 

Beside me on the balcony, Hat was laughing now. But I was too upset 
to find it funny. 

How could Hat have missed such an easy shot? 

Charlene let out a scream that rattled the gym rafters. She hobbled the 
tarantula from one hand to the other. 

Then it dropped to the floor at her feet. 

Charlene leapt back, still screaming, both hands pressed against the 
sides of her face. 

Everyone in the gym class had huddled around. Some kids still looked 
confused. Others were laughing. A couple of girls were trying to comfort 
Molly, whose hair was standing straight up on her head. 

“Oh, wow. Oh, wow,” Hat kept repeating, shaking his head. “Oh, 
wow.” 



Gripping the balcony edge with both hands, I watched Courtney bend 
over and gently pick up the tarantula from the gym floor. She placed it in 
the palm of her hand and appeared to be saying soothing words to it. 

The kids had formed a circle around Courtney. As she held the 
tarantula close to her face, they quieted down and watched. 

“It’s just a tarantula,” Courtney said, petting its hairy back with one 
finger. “Tarantulas don’t bite that often. And if they do, it doesn’t hurt very 
much.” 

Kids began murmuring once again about how brave Courtney was. I 
saw Molly and Charlene comforting each other at the edge of the circle. 
Charlene was smoothing down Molly’s hair. Molly’s whole body was still 
quivering. 

“Where did this tarantula come from?” Courtney was asking. 

I saw Molly stare up angrily at us. She raised her fist and shook it 
toward us. 

I ducked down out of sight behind the balcony wall. 

“The plan didn’t work too well,” Hat murmured. 

Is he the master of understatement—or what? 

We didn’t realize that the disaster wasn’t over. “Let’s get out of here,” I 
whispered. 

Too late. We both looked up to see Mr. Russo glaring angrily at us 
from the balcony entrance. “What are you boys doing up here?” he asked 
suspiciously. 

I turned to Hat. Hat stared back at me blankly. 

Neither of us could think of a good answer. 

“Come on back downstairs,” Mr. Russo said softly, holding open the 
door for us. “Let’s have a nice, long talk.” 

It could have been worse, I thought. Sure, Hat and I had to stay after school 
and clean the science lab every afternoon for the next two weeks. And sure, 
we had to write one-thousand-word essays on why it’s wrong to steal living 
things and drop them on people’s heads. 

And sure, Molly and Charlene aren’t speaking to Hat or me. 

But it could have been worse. 

I mean, what if Hat and I were still locked in the supply cabinet? That 
would be worse, wouldn’t it? 



It was later that afternoon. I was slumped on my bed, glumly thinking 
about gym class and how our plan had bombed. 

It’s all Courtney’s fault, I told myself, absently pulling at a little tear in 
my bedspread. 

Courtney had moved just at the last minute. 

She must have moved. Hat couldn’t be that bad of an aim. 

I sighed bitterly as once again I pictured Courtney calmly picking the 
tarantula up off the floor and petting it. “It’s only a tarantula,” Courtney 
had said. So smug. So superior. “It’s only a tarantula. They don’t bite very 
often. ” 

Why didn’t it bite her hand? 

That would have wiped the smug expression off her face. 

Why did she have to be so totally brave? 

Courtney really deserves to be scared out of her wits, I thought 
unhappily. I tore at the little rip in the bedspread, turning it into a big rip. 

She’s really asking for it, asking to be frightened speechless. 

But how, how, how? 

Sitting on the edge of the bed, I had my head lowered and my 
shoulders hunched. I was leaning forward glumly, picking at the bedspread 
without even realizing it. 

Again I pictured Hat letting the tarantula drop. 

Again I saw it land on Molly’s head. 

No! No! No! 

Again I saw Molly start to do her frantic, furious dance. 

The unhappy picture vanished from my mind as I suddenly realized I 
was no longer alone. Raising my eyes to the doorway, I gasped sharply. 

And saw the tall, lean monster stagger toward me, its face dripping 
with dark blood. 



13 


The tall monster lurched toward me, its dripping arms reaching out in front 
of it, ready to grab me. 

“Kevin—get out of here!” I cried. “You’re dripping mud all over my 
floor!” 

My older brother Kevin lowered his arms to his sides. “It isn’t real 
mud, punk,” he said. “It’s makeup.” 

“I don’t care,” I replied shrilly, jumping up off the bed and giving him 
a hard shove in the stomach. “It’s dripping all over.” 

He laughed. “Scared you, didn’t I?” 

“No way!” I insisted. “I knew it was you.” 

“You thought it was a Mud Monster,” he said, grinning at me through 
the thick, brownish-orange gunk dripping down his face. “Admit it, punk.” 

I hate when he calls me punk. I guess that’s why he does it. “You don’t 
look like a Mud Monster,” I told him nastily. “You just look like a pile of 
garbage.” 

“We scared some little kids who came into the woods this afternoon,” 
Kevin said gleefully. “You should’ve seen their faces. We ran at them and 
yelled BOO. Two of them started to cry.” He snickered. 

“Way to go,” I muttered. I gave him another shove toward the door and 
got the thick, brownish-orange gunk all over my hands. 

“The video is almost finished,” he told me, deliberately wiping his 
hand on my open notebook. He stared down at the dark stain he had made 
on my math homework. “Maybe I’ll let you see it when it’s done.” 

“Get away from my stuff, Kevin!” I said angrily. Then I remembered 
what I wanted to ask him, and changed my tone. “Can I be in the video?” I 
pleaded. “Please? You said maybe I could be in it—remember?” 

“Huh-uh, punk.” He shook his head. “You’d get too scared.” 

“What?” Was he putting me on? 

“You’d get too scared, Eddie,” he repeated, scratching his forehead 
through the heavy, wet makeup. “All alone in the deep, dark woods with 
three Mud Monsters walking around. You’d lose it. You’d totally lose it.” 

“Hey—” I cried angrily. “You’re not funny, Kevin. You promised—” 



“No, I didn’t,” Kevin insisted. A big brown blob of gunk fell off his 
shoulder and landed with a splat on my floor. “Whoa. You’re going to have 
to clean that up,” he said, grinning meanly. 

“I’m going to make you eat it!” I shouted angrily, crossing my arms 
over my chest. 

He just laughed. 

I suddenly had an idea. “Kevin, will you help me with something?” I 
asked thoughtfully. 

“Probably not,” he replied, still grinning. “What is it?” 

“Do you have any good ideas for scaring someone?” I asked. 

He narrowed his eyes at me. Then he gestured to the brownish-orange 
stuff covering his whole body. “Isn’t this scary enough?” 

“No. I mean, some other way to scare someone,” I said, wondering 
how to explain. I decided just to come right out and say it. “Some friends 
and I, we’re trying to scare this girl, Courtney.” 

“Why?” Kevin demanded, resting a globby hand on my dresser top. 

“You know. Just for fun,” I told him. 

He nodded. 

“But we haven’t been able to scare her at all,” I continued. 
“Everything we try totally bombs out.” I sank back onto my bed. 

“What have you tried?” Kevin asked. 

“Oh. A couple of things. A snake and a tarantula,” I said. “But she 
didn’t get scared.” 

“Too small,” he muttered. He stepped away from the dresser. I could 
see that he had left a big brown stain on the side. 

“Huh? What do you mean Too small’?” I demanded. 

“Too small,” he repeated. “You’re trying to scare her with little things. 
You’ve got to scare her with something big. You know. Maybe something 
bigger than she is.” 

I thought about what he was saying. It seemed to make sense. “What 
do you mean by big?” I asked him. “You mean like an elephant?” 

He frowned and shook his head. “Eddie, where are you going to get an 
elephant? I mean like a big dog. You know. A huge, growling dog.” 

“A dog?” I scratched my head. 

“Yeah. Let’s say this girl Courtney is walking down the street, or she’s 
in the woods, maybe—and suddenly she hears angry growls and snarls. She 



looks up and sees this enormous dog, its mouth open, its fangs bared, 
running right at her. That’ll scare her. No problem.” 

“Not bad,” I said thoughtfully. “Not bad. You’re a genius, Kevin. 
Really.” 

“Tell me about it,” he replied. He walked out of the room, leaving a 
muddy trail behind him. 

A huge, growling dog, I thought. I pictured it in my mind. I pictured it 
raising its head to the moon and howling like a wolf. 

Then I pictured Courtney walking innocently down a dark street. She 
hears a sound. A low growl. She stops. Her eyes grow wide with fear. 

What’s that noise? she wonders. 

And then she sees it. The biggest, meanest, loudest, angriest dog that 
ever lived. Its eyes glow red. It pulls back its heavy lips to reveal a mouth 
full of pointy fangs. 

With an earth-shattering growl, it makes its leap. It goes right for her 
throat. 

Courtney cries out for help. Then she turns. She’s running now, 
running for her life, shrieking and crying like a frightened baby. 

“Here, boy,” I call to the attacking beast. 

The dog stops. It turns around. It walks quickly to me, its tail wagging. 
Courtney is still crying, still shaking all over, as the dog gently licks my 
hand. 

“It’s only a dog,” I tell her. “Dogs won’t hurt you—unless they sense 
that you’re afraid !” 

I jumped up from my bed, laughing out loud. 

It’s definitely worth a try, I thought excitedly. Definitely worth a try. 

Now, who do I know who has an enormous, growling, ferocious dog? 



14 


Saturday afternoon we were in Charlene’s back yard, trying out the new 
croquet set her father had bought. It was an overcast day. High clouds kept 
blocking out the sun, sending long, gray shadows over the back lawn. 

The roar of a power mower from next door made it a little hard to be 
heard. But I was telling Molly, Charlene, and Hat about my brother’s idea 
for scaring Courtney. 

“A big, angry dog is way scary,” Hat quickly agreed. He tapped his 
mallet hard against his green croquet ball and sent mine sailing into the 
hedge. 

Molly frowned. She still hadn’t forgiven me for the tarantula incident, 
even though I had apologized a thousand times. She straightened the bottom 
of her yellow T-shirt over her black Lycra bike shorts and prepared to take 
her turn. 

“We need a dog that really looks vicious,” Molly said. She slammed 
her ball hard. It missed the hoop and bounced off a wooden peg. 

“I guess my dog, Buttercup, could do it,” Charlene offered, sighing. 

“Huh? Buttercup?” I cried out in surprise. “Get serious, Charlene. 
Buttercup is a big, lovable oaf. He couldn’t scare a fly.” 

A teasing smile formed on Charlene’s face. “Buttercup could do it,” 
she repeated. 

“Oh, sure,” I said, rolling my eyes. “He’s real vicious. That’s why you 
gave him a vicious name like Buttercup.” 

“It’s your turn,” Molly said to me, pointing to my ball way over at the 
hedge. 

“This is such a boring game,” I complained. “Why does anyone like 

it?” 

“I like it,” Hat said. He was winning. 

Charlene cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted, “Buttercup! 
Buttercup! Come here, you ferocious beast!” 

A few seconds later, the big Saint Bernard came lumbering toward us 
from the side of the house. His bushy, white tail was wagging hard, making 
his entire backside waggle as he hurried across the grass, his big pink 



tongue drooping out. 

“Ooh, I’m scared! I’m scared!” I cried sarcastically. I dropped my 
croquet mallet and hugged myself, pretending to shiver in fright. 

Buttercup ignored me. He ran up to Charlene and started licking her 
hand, making tiny mewing sounds, almost like a cat. 

“Ooh, he’s tough,” I exclaimed. 

Hat came up beside me, adjusting his baseball cap over his eyes. “He’s 
a big, lovable Saint Bernard, Charlene,” Hat said, bending to scratch the 
dog behind the ears. “He’s not too scary. We need a big wolf. Or a six-foot- 
tall Doberman.” 

Buttercup turned his big head to lick Hat’s hand. 

“Yuck!” Hat made a disgusted face. “I hate dog slobber.” 

“Where can we get a real attack dog?” I asked, picking up my mallet 
and leaning on it like a cane. “Do we know anyone who has a guard dog? A 
big, ugly German shepherd, maybe?” 

Charlene still had that teasing grin on her face, as if she knew 
something the rest of us didn’t. “Give Buttercup a chance,” she said softly. 
“You might be surprised.” 

Clouds drifted over the sun again. The air suddenly grew cooler as 
gray shadows slid over the grass. 

The power mower on the other side of the hedge sputtered to a stop. 
The back yard suddenly seemed eerily quiet and still. 

Buttercup dropped to the grass and rolled onto his back. His four furry 
paws kicked the air as he scratched his back on the lawn. 

“Not too impressive, Charlene,” Hat said, laughing. The dog looked so 
stupid. 

“I haven’t done our little trick yet,” Charlene replied. “Just watch.” 

She turned to the dog and started to whistle. A tuneless whistle, just a 
bunch of shrill, flat tones. 

The big Saint Bernard reacted immediately. As soon as he heard 
Charlene’s whistle, he rolled off his back and climbed to his feet. His tail 
shot out stiffly behind him. His entire body appeared to go rigid. His ears 
stood up on his head. 

Charlene continued to whistle. Not loudly. A steady, low whistle of 
long, shrill notes. 

And as we stared in silent surprise, Buttercup began to growl. The 



growl started deep in his stomach, angry and menacing. 

He pulled back his dark lips. He bared his big teeth. 

He growled loudly. His growl became a vicious snarl. 

The dog’s eyes glowed angrily. His back stiffened. His head arched 
back as if preparing to attack. 

Charlene sucked in a deep breath and whistled some more. Her eyes 
were locked on the growling dog. 

“Buttercup—get Eddie!” Charlene suddenly screamed. “Get Eddie! 
Kill! Kilir 



15 


“No!” I shrieked and fell back toward the hedge. 

The dog growled a warning. Then it leapt to attack. 

I raised my arms in front of me as a shield and waited for the impact. 

And waited. 

When I slowly lowered my arms, I saw that Charlene was hugging the 
dog around the neck. Charlene had a gleeful grin on her face. Buttercup 
turned and planted a slobbery dog kiss on her forehead. 

“Gotcha, Eddie!” Charlene declared. “That was to pay you back for 
the tarantula.” 

Molly laughed. “Way to go, Charlene.” 

“Wow,” I exclaimed weakly. My heart was still pounding. The back 
yard was spinning in front of me. 

“That’s a good trick,” Hat told Charlene. “How did you teach him 
that?” 

“I didn’t,” Charlene said, giving the dog a final hug, then shoving him 
away from her. “It was sort of an accident. I was whistling one day, and 
Buttercup went ballistic on me. He started growling and snarling, showing 
his teeth.” 

“I guess he really hates the way you whistle!” I exclaimed, starting to 
feel a little more normal. 

“He hates anyone whistling,” Charlene replied, brushing dog fur off 
the legs of her denim cutoffs. “Maybe it hurts his ears or something. I don’t 
know. But you can see what it makes him do. He goes nuts like that every 
time someone whistles.” 

“That’s great!” Hat declared. 

“He really can terrify Courtney,” Molly said. 

We watched the dog lumber away, his tongue hanging nearly to the 
ground. He sniffed at something in the flower bed, then disappeared around 
the side of the house. 

“Poor dog,” Charlene said, shaking her head. “He hates California. 
He’s hot all the time. But when we moved here from Michigan, we just 
couldn’t bear to part with him.” 



“I’m glad you didn’t,” I said enthusiastically. “Now we’re finally 
going to scare the life out of Courtney!” 

Molly tapped a croquet ball softly with her mallet. She had a troubled 
expression on her face. “We’re not really going to hurt Courtney, are we?” 
she asked. “I mean, Buttercup isn’t really going to attack her, is he? If he 
gets out of control...” 

“Of course not,” Charlene answered quickly. “He stops growling and 
carrying on as soon as I stop whistling. Really. As soon as the whistling 
stops, he goes right back to his gentle personality.” 

Molly looked relieved. She tapped the ball through a hoop, then used 
the mallet to push it back out. 

We had all lost interest in the croquet game. Planning how we were 
going to use Buttercup to terrify Courtney was a lot more exciting than any 
game. 

The sun had poked out from the high clouds. The closely trimmed 
grass gleamed brightly in the sunlight. We tossed down the mallets and 
made our way to the shade of the big grapefruit tree in the center of the 
back yard. 

“We should scare Courtney in the woods, at that tree house she and 
Denise built by Muddy Creek,” I suggested, sprawling on my back on the 
grass. “It’s the perfect place. She and Denise all alone in the woods. 
Suddenly, a snarling dog leaps out at them. They’ll both scream for a 
week!” 

“Yeah, that’s good,” Hat agreed. “In the woods, there are plenty of 
places for us to hide and watch. I mean, Charlene can hide behind a bush or 
an evergreen or something and whistle her brains out. We’ll all be hidden. 
Courtney will never know who did it.” 

Sitting with her legs crossed, Molly chewed her lower lip thoughtfully. 
She pushed her glasses up on her nose. “I don’t like it,” she said. “It’s no 
fun if we don’t scare Courtney in front of a lot of people. If we scare her in 
the woods with no one around, who will care?” 

“We will!” I argued. “ We will see it. That’s all that counts. We will 
know that we finally managed to terrify her.” 

“And maybe we can all jump out and yell ‘Gotcha!’ and stuff, so she’ll 
know we saw her get frightened,” Charlene added enthusiastically. “Then 
we’ll spread it around school, and everyone will know.” 



“I like it!” Hat declared. 

“When should we do it?” Molly asked. 

“How about now?” I said, jumping to my feet. 

“Huh? Now?” Charlene reacted with surprise. 

“Why not?” I argued. “Let’s just go do it. Maybe we’ll get lucky and 
find Courtney and Denise at their tree house. They go there a lot on 
weekends, you know, to hang out and read and stuff.” 

“Yeah! Let’s go!” Hat jumped up and slapped me on the back. “Let’s 
do it!” 

“I’ll go get Buttercup’s leash,” Charlene said. “I guess there’s no 
reason to wait.” She turned to Molly, who was hanging back. 

“I have a better idea,” Molly said, pulling a blade of grass from her 
brown hair. “Before we go running off to the woods, let’s make sure that 
Courtney is at the tree house.” 

“Huh? How do we do that?” I asked. 

“Simple,” she replied. And then Molly did the most amazing 
impersonation of Denise. “Hello, Courtney. Meet me at the tree house in 
ten minutes, okay?” It was incredible! She sounded just like Denise! 

We all gaped at her in amazement. 

“Molly, I didn’t know you were so talented,” Charlene said, laughing. 

“I’ve been practicing,” Molly said. “I can do all kinds of voices. I’m 
really pretty good at it.” 

“Molly, maybe you can do cartoon voices when you get older,” I 
suggested. “You could be Daffy Duck. You sound a lot like him already!” 

Hat laughed. Molly stuck her tongue out at me. 

“Let’s go inside and call Courtney,” Charlene said eagerly, sliding 
open the screen door. “If she isn’t home, she’s probably already at the tree 
house. So we’ll get Buttercup and go there. If she is home, Molly can 
pretend to be Denise and tell Courtney to meet at the tree house.” 

We made our way into the kitchen. Charlene handed the kitchen phone 
to Molly. Then she brought over the cordless phone for the rest of us to 
listen in on. 

Molly punched in Courtney’s number, and we each held our breath as 
we listened to the phone ring. One ring. Two. 

Courtney picked it up after the second ring. “Hello?” 

Molly put on her best Denise voice. “Hi, Courtney. It’s me.” She really 



sounded just like Denise. I think she could’ve fooled Denise’s own mother! 

“Can you meet me in the woods? You know. At the tree house?” Molly 
asked in Denise’s voice. 

“Who is this?” Courtney demanded. 

“It’s me, of course. Denise,” Molly replied. 

“That’s weird,” we all heard Courtney say. “How can you be Denise 
when Denise is standing here right next to me?” 



16 


“Oops. Wrong number,” Molly said. She quickly slammed down the 
receiver. 

Calling Courtney had turned out to be a bad idea. 

Our plan hadn’t exactly worked. But we were sure we could scare 
Courtney with Buttercup. We just had to catch her in the woods at the right 
time. 

The next day, Sunday, it rained. I was very disappointed. 

My brother, Kevin, stood beside me at the window, watching the 
raindrops patter against the glass. He was very disappointed, too. He and 
his friends had planned to finish their Mud Monsters video in the woods. 

“Today we were going to tape the big finish where the Mud Monsters 
rise up out of the mud,” he said. 

“Maybe the rain will stop,” I told him. 

“It doesn’t matter,” Kevin sighed. “We won’t be able to shoot 
anyway.” 

“Why not?” I asked. 

“Too muddy,” he replied. 

The week dragged by. It rained just about every day. 

On Saturday afternoon, the sun came out. Charlene put Buttercup on a 
leash, and we eagerly headed to the woods. 

“Courtney’s got to be there. She’s got to!” I declared. 

“Someone has to scout out the tree house,” Molly said. “Someone has 
to make sure Courtney and Denise are there before we let Buttercup go.” 

“I’ll do it!” Hat and I volunteered in unison. 

Everyone laughed. We were in a good mood. I think we all had a really 
good feeling, a feeling that this was the day we were finally going to scare 
Courtney out of her wits. 

The woods started a few blocks from Charlene’s house. It was a really 
pretty day, the first all week. Everything smelled fresh and sweet from all 
the rain. 

Buttercup kept stopping to sniff flowers and bushes and other plants. 



Charlene had to keep tugging the leash to keep him walking. It was a tough 
job. It isn’t easy to tug a Saint Bernard if he doesn’t want to be tugged! 

“My mouth is kind of dry,” Charlene complained as we neared the 
edge of the woods. “I hope I can whistle okay.” 

She tried whistling. It came out real breathy. Not much whistle sound. 

But that didn’t seem to matter to Buttercup. He raised his head 
instantly. His ears shot up and his tail stood straight back. 

Charlene blew harder, but she still wasn’t getting much sound. 

Buttercup’s stomach began to rumble. The rumble became a low 
growl. The growl became a snarl as the big dog ferociously bared his teeth. 

“Charlene—stop,” I said. “Don’t waste it.” 

Charlene stopped whistling. The dog relaxed. 

“Does anyone have some gum?” Charlene asked, holding her throat. 
“My mouth is really dry.” 

Molly handed her a stick of gum. 

“Buttercup is ready!” Hat declared happily as we stepped into the 
woods. 

Shadows of the leaves overhead danced on the ground. Sparkling rays 
of sunlight beamed down through the trees. Twigs and dried leaves crackled 
under our sneakers as we walked. 

“Come on, dog!” Charlene pleaded, tugging hard at the leash. 

“Ssshh,” Molly warned. “We’ve got to be quiet now. If Courtney is in 
the woods, she’ll hear us.” 

“Come on, Buttercup!” Charlene repeated in a loud whisper. 

The dog was being difficult. He kept stopping to sniff things. He 
pulled at the leash, trying to break free and go off on his own. I guess there 
were too many exciting smells for him. His tail was wagging back and 
forth, and he was panting noisily. 

We were deep in the woods now, approaching the creek. It grew 
shadier and cooler. Purple shadows surrounded us as we walked. 

“I’ll sneak up near the tree house and see if Courtney and Denise are 
there,” I whispered. I handed the brown paper bag I’d been carrying to Hat. 
“Hold this for me. I’ll be right back.” 

Hat gazed suspiciously at the bag. “What’s in it?” 

“You’ll see,” I told him and hurried off on my scouting mission. 
Keeping low, I made my way through a clump of tall weeds. 



I glanced back at my friends. They had clustered around Buttercup. 
The big dog had plopped down on the ground and was chewing on a big 
stick. 

As I followed a narrow dirt path through the trees, I realized my heart 
was pounding excitedly. This was it! The day of our victory over Courtney. 

Her tree house was perched near the creek on the other side of a small, 
grassy clearing. As I approached the clearing, I could hear the soft trickle of 
water from the creekbed. 

Slipping between the trees, I kept in the shadows. I didn’t want to be 
spotted by Courtney or Denise. That would spoil the surprise. 

A smile broke over my face as I thought about how scared they were 
about to become. If they were there.... 

I stopped at the edge of the clearing and peered across it. The tall grass 
was matted down by dozens of footprints. I realized that my brother and his 
friends must have taped part of their Mud Monsters video there. 

Keeping under the trees, I began to make my way around the circle of 
the clearing. There, on the other side, Courtney’s tree house came into view. 
It looked like a large wooden crate, perched in the lowest limb of an old oak 
tree. A rope ladder connected it to the ground. 

Were they there? Courtney and Denise? 

I couldn’t see them. 

I took a few more steps, pushing tall weeds out of the way as I came 
nearer. “Ow,” I muttered as something prickled my shoulder. Glancing 
down, I carefully pulled two burrs from the sleeve of my T-shirt. 

Then I kept walking, trying to be silent as I moved nearer the tree 
house. 

I stopped when I heard voices. Girls’ voices. 

And then I saw Courtney and Denise. They were just ahead of me, 
walking in the woods. 

I ducked low behind a clump of thick shrubs. 

They were only a few feet in front of me. Had they seen me? 

No. 

They were talking excitedly, having some kind of heated discussion. I 
watched them through the shrub. They were both wearing blue midriff tops 
and white denim shorts. Twins. 

They were walking slowly in the other direction, casually pulling up 



weeds and wildflowers as they walked. 

Great! I thought. This is perfect ! 

I knew this was the day! 

I turned and silently hurried away. I couldn’t wait to get back to my 
friends. 

I found them in the same spot, still huddled around the dog. 
“Buttercup, do your stuff!” I cried excitedly, grinning and waving as I ran 
up to them. 

“You mean they’re there?” Hat asked, surprised. 

“They’re there,” I said breathlessly, “waiting to be scared.” 

“Great!” Molly and Charlene exclaimed. Charlene tried to tug 
Buttercup to his feet. 

“Wait,” I said. I grabbed the brown paper bag from Hat. “Before 
Buttercup gets up, let’s put this on first.” 

I pulled out the can of shaving cream I had brought. 

“What’s that for?” Hat demanded. 

“I thought we’d smear shaving cream around his mouth,” I explained. 
“You know. Make him look like he’s frothing. Rabid dogs always froth at 
the mouth. When they see a growling dog frothing up white stuff as he 
attacks them, Courtney and Denise will drop dead!” 

“Excellent!” Molly cried, slapping me on the back. “That’s really 
excellent!” 

Everyone congratulated me. Sometimes I do have great ideas, I have to 
admit. 

Buttercup lumbered to his feet. He started pulling Charlene toward the 
clearing. 

“Let him get closer to them,” Charlene whispered loudly, as the big 
dog trotted through the trees, dragging her with him. “Then we’ll smear the 
stuff on and let him loose.” 

Molly, Hat, and I followed close behind. A short while later, we were 
at the edge of the clearing. We stopped behind the tall, thick shrubs and 
squatted down. We were completely hidden from view there. 

Courtney and Denise had stepped into the clearing. They were 
standing in the tall grass, their arms crossed over their chests, their heads 
bowed as they discussed whatever it was they were discussing. 

We could hear the murmur of their voices, but we weren’t close 



enough to hear what they were saying. Behind them, we could hear the 
creek trickling past in its muddy bed. 

“It’s showtime, Buttercup,” Charlene whispered, bending down to 
unleash the dog. She turned back to us. “As soon as he heads into the 
clearing, I’ll start whistling.” 

Gripping the shaving cream can, I sprayed a thick puddle of white 
lather into my hand. 

Suddenly I heard a sound behind us in the trees. 

A rustling, crackling sound. Something running over the dry leaves 
and twigs. A squirrel appeared in a break between the shrubs. 

Buttercup saw it, too. As I leaned over and reached out my hand to 
smear the shaving cream on his mouth, the big dog took off. 

I toppled over onto my face. 

I looked up in time to see the dog bolting for the trees, chasing after 
the squirrel. 

My three friends were already on their feet. “Buttercup! Buttercup! 
Come back!” Charlene was shouting. 

I climbed to my feet. I had shaving cream smeared over the front of 
my T-shirt. Ignoring it, I turned and ran into the trees after them. 

They were already pretty far ahead of me. I couldn’t see them. But I 
could hear Charlene yelling, “Buttercup! Come back! Buttercup—where 
are you?” 



17 


I ran as fast as I could and caught up with my friends. “Where—where’s 
Buttercup?” I asked breathlessly. 

“Over there somewhere, I think,” Charlene replied, pointing to a thick 
clump of trees. 

“No. I think I heard him over there,” Hat said, pointing in the opposite 
direction. 

“We can’t lose him,” I said, struggling to catch my breath. “He’s too 
big to lose.” 

“I didn’t know he could run that fast,” Charlene said unhappily. “He 
really wants to catch that squirrel.” 

“Doesn’t he know he has a job to do?” Molly asked, searching the 
trees. 

“I—I shouldn’t have let go of the leash,” Charlene moaned. “Now 
we’ll never catch the big oaf.” 

“Sure we will,” I replied, trying to sound cheerful. “He’ll come back to 
us after the squirrel runs away.” 

Dirt and dried leaves had stuck to the shaving cream when I fell over. 
Now I had a big, dark smear on my T-shirt. I wiped at it with my hand as 
my eyes searched the woods for Buttercup. 

“We’d better split up,” Charlene said. She looked really worried. 
“We’ve got to find him before he gets into some kind of trouble. He isn’t 
used to the woods.” 

“Maybe he’s by the creek,” Molly suggested, straightening her glasses. 
She had a twig caught in her hair. I pulled it out for her. 

“Let’s stop talking and go find him,” I urged impatiently. “Maybe we 
can still scare Courtney and Denise with him.” 

I’m always the optimist in the group. 

“Let’s just find him,” Charlene murmured, a tight, worried expression 
on her face. “If anything happens to Buttercup...” She was too upset to 
finish her sentence. 

We split up. I took the path that led toward the creek. I began jogging, 
pushing away low tree branches as I made my way along the twisting path. 



“Buttercup! Buttercup!” I called in a loud whisper. 

How could that dumb dog mess us up like this? How could he be so 
irresponsible? 

“Ow!” A sharp thorn tore through my wrist as I ran past a large 
bramble bush. I stopped to examine the cut, breathing hard. A small 
teardrop of bright red blood appeared on my wrist. 

Ignoring it, I resumed my search. “Buttercup! Buttercup?” 

I should be pretty near the creek by now, I realized. But I couldn’t hear 
the sound of the water. 

Was I on the right path? Had I gotten turned around somehow? 

I began running faster, jumping over a fallen log, pushing my way 
through tall reeds. The ground became soft and marshy. My sneakers were 
sinking into soft mud as I ran. 

Shouldn’t the clearing be right up ahead? 

Shouldn’t the creek be on this side of the clearing? 

I stopped. I leaned over, struggling to catch my breath, resting my 
hands on my knees. 

When I looked up, I realized I was lost. 

I gazed up to find the sun. Perhaps I could recapture my sense of 
direction. But the trees were too thick. Little sunlight filtered through. 

“I’m lost,” I said out loud, more startled than frightened. “I don’t 
believe it. I’m lost in the woods.” 

I spun around, searching for something familiar. Slender, white¬ 
trunked trees nearly formed a thick fence behind me. Darker trees 
surrounded me on the three other sides. 

“Hey—can anyone hear me?” I cried. My voice came out shrill and 
frightened. 

“Can anyone hear me?” I repeated, forcing myself to shout louder. 

No reply. 

A bird cawed loudly overhead. I heard fluttering wings. 

“Hey, Hat! Molly! Charlene!” I called their names several times. 

No reply. 

A cold shiver rolled down my back. “Hey, I’m lost!” I shouted. “Hey 
—somebody!” 

And then I heard the crunch of footsteps to my left. Heavy footsteps. 
Coming toward me rapidly. 



“Hey, guys—is that you?” I cried, listening hard. 

No reply. The heavy footsteps moved closer. 

I stared into the dark trees. 

I heard the caw of another bird. More fluttering wings. 

Heavy footsteps. Dry leaves crunching. 

“Buttercup—is that you? Hey—Buttercup?” 

It had to be the dog. I took a few steps toward the approaching sounds. 

I stopped when the dog stepped into view. 

“Buttercup?” 

No. 

I gasped as I stared into the glaring red eyes of another dog. An 
enormous, mean-looking dog, nearly as tall as a pony, with smooth, black 
fur. 

It lowered its sleek head and snarled at me, its red eyes glowing 
angrily. “Nice doggie,” I said weakly. “Nice doggie.” It bared its teeth and 
let out a terrifying growl. Then it took a running start and, snarling with 
fury, leapt at my throat. 



18 


“Hey!” An alarmed voice called out from somewhere behind me. 

The snarling dog appeared to stop in midair. 

Its eyes still glowing like hot coals, it landed hard on all four legs. 

“Hey—go away!” the voice cried. 

I turned to see Hat running toward me, swinging a long stick in one 
hand. “Go away, dog!” Hat shouted. 

The dog lowered its head and let out a growl, its eyes still on me. It 
took a reluctant step back, its smooth black tail tucked between its heavy 
legs. It took another step back. Then another. 

“Go away!” I took up the cry. “Go away!” 

I don’t know if it was because there were now two of us, or whether it 
was the stick Hat was swinging in front of him—but the enormous creature 
suddenly turned and loped off into the trees. 

“Oh, wow,” I moaned. “Wow. Wow. That was close.” I suddenly 
realized I’d been holding my breath for so long, my chest hurt. I let it out in 
a loud whoosh. 

“Are you okay?” Hat asked. 

“Yeah, I guess,” I replied shakily. “Thanks for saving my life.” 

He stared into the trees where the dog had disappeared. “Was that a 
dog or a horse?” Hat cried. “He looked mean enough, didn’t he?” 

I nodded. My throat suddenly felt very dry. It was hard to talk. I knew 
I’d be seeing that growling beast again, in nightmares. 

“Did you find Buttercup?” I managed to ask. 

Hat kicked at a fallen tree trunk. He shook his head. “No. Not yet. 
Charlene’s getting a little ballistic.” 

“I—I know how she feels,” I stammered. I glanced to the trees. For 
some reason, I thought I saw the big, black dog coming back for me. 

But it was just a gust of wind, shaking the leaves. 

“We’d better get back,” Hat said, giving the tree trunk a final kick. 

I followed him along the path. It curved and then sloped downhill. 
Little creatures rustled the dry leaves at our feet. Chipmunks, I thought. 

I didn’t pay any attention to them. I was still picturing the enormous, 



growling monster, still thinking about my close call. 

We caught up to Molly and Charlene a short while later. They both 
looked really miserable. 

“What are we going to do?” Charlene whined. She had her hands 
jammed tightly into the pockets of her jeans. She looked about to cry. “I 
can’t go home without Buttercup!” she wailed. “I can’t!” 

“I’ll bet your dog went home,” Molly said. “I’ll bet that stupid dog is 
home already.” 

Charlene’s face brightened a little. “Do you think so? You don’t think 
he’s lost in the woods?” 

“Dogs don’t get lost,” I offered. “Only people get lost.” 

“He’s right,” Hat agreed. “Dogs have a great sense of direction. 
Buttercup is probably at home.” 

“Let’s go check it out,” Molly urged, putting a comforting hand on 
Charlene’s shoulder. 

“And what if he isn’t there?” Charlene demanded miserably. “Then 
what?” 

“Then we’ll call the police and ask them to help us find him,” Molly 
told her. 

That answer seemed to satisfy Charlene. The four of us unhappily 
began trudging out of the woods. 

We had just stepped out from the trees and were heading toward the 
street when Courtney and Denise came into view. 

They were standing at the curb. There were two dogs standing with 
them. 

Buttercup stood on one side of Courtney. The huge, black dog-monster 
sat on its haunches on Courtney’s other side. 

“Hi!” Courtney called as we went running up to them. “Do these dogs 
belong to any of you?” 

I just stopped and stared in disbelief. 

Buttercup was affectionately licking Courtney’s hand. The big, black 
dog was tenderly licking her other hand. 

“The Saint Bernard is mine!” Charlene cried happily. 

“You should hold on to his leash,” Courtney told her. “He was totally 
lost when I found him.” She handed Buttercup’s leash to Charlene. 

Charlene thanked her. 



“Isn’t this other dog a sweetheart?” Courtney cooed. She bent down 
and gave the huge black monster a nose kiss. 

That’s when I decided to give up. 

It was impossible, I saw. There was no way —no way —we would ever 
scare Courtney. 

It was time to admit defeat, I told myself. 

Little did I know just how scary things were soon going to get. 



19 


Icy hands, cold as death, wrapped around my neck. 

I screamed. 

Charlene laughed. “Eddie, what’s your problem? A little tense?” 

“Why are your hands so cold?” I demanded, rubbing my neck. 

She held up a can of Coke. “I just took this from the fridge.” 

Everyone laughed at me. 

The four of us were sitting in Charlene’s den a few days later, trying to 
decide what to try next. It was about eight-thirty on a Thursday night. We’d 
told our parents we were studying together for our math final. 

“I think we should just give up,” I said glumly. “We can’t scare 
Courtney. We just can’t.” 

“Eddie’s right,” Hat agreed. He was sitting next to Molly on the brown 
leather couch. I was slouched in the big armchair across from them. 

Charlene had dropped down to the shaggy white carpet. 

“There’s got to be a way,” Charlene insisted. “Courtney isn’t a robot, 
you know. She’s got to get scared sometimes!” 

“I’m not so sure,” I said, shaking my head. 

At that moment, Buttercup padded into the room, his tail wagging 
behind him. He made his way to Charlene and started licking her arm. 

“Get that traitor out of here!” I demanded sharply. 

Buttercup raised his head and gave me a long, wet stare with those 
sorrowful brown eyes of his. 

“You heard me, Buttercup,” I said coldly. “You’re a traitor.” 

“He’s just a dog,” Charlene said, defending him. She pulled the furry 
beast down beside her on the rug. 

“Dogs sure seem to like Courtney,” Molly commented. 

“Snakes and tarantulas like her, too,” I added bitterly. “There’s nothing 
Courtney is scared of. Nothing.” 

Molly suddenly got this devilish expression on her face. “Want to see 
something really scary?” she asked. She reached over to the other side of 
the couch and pulled the baseball cap off Hat’s head. 



“YUCK!” the three of us all cried at once. “Scary!” 

Hat’s dark hair was plastered to his head. It looked like wood or 
something. He had a deep red mark across his forehead made by the rim of 
the cap. 

“Hey!” Hat cried angrily. He grabbed the cap back and jammed it onto 
his head. 

“Don’t you ever wash your hair?” Charlene cried. 

“What for?” Hat replied. He got up and walked to the mirror so he 
could adjust the cap the way he liked it. 

We talked about scaring Courtney for a while longer. We were pretty 
depressed about the whole thing. We just couldn’t think of any good ideas. 

At a little after nine o’clock, my mom called and told me I had to come 
home. So I said good night to my friends and headed out the door. 

It had rained most of the day. Now the air was cool and wet. The front 
lawns shimmered wetly in the pale light from the street lamps. 

My house was four blocks away on the same street. I wished I had 
ridden my bike. I don’t really like walking alone this late at night. Some of 
the street lamps were out, and it was kind of creepy. 

Okay, okay. I admit it. I’m a lot easier to scare than Courtney. 

Cold hands on the back of my neck are enough to make me jump. 

Maybe that’s what we should try on Courtney, I thought as I crossed 
the street and started down the next block. Icy cold hands on the back of her 
neck. . . 

I was passing an empty lot, a long rectangle of tall weeds and 
overgrown shrubs. In the corner of my eye, I saw something move along the 
ground. 

A darting shadow, black against the yellow-gray ground. 

Something scurrying through the tall weeds toward me. 

I swallowed hard, feeling my throat tighten up. I started to jog. 

The shadow slid toward me. 

I heard a low moan. 

Just the wind? 

No. Too human to be the wind. 

Another moan, more of a cry this time. 

The trees all began to shake and whisper. Black shadows swept 
quickly toward me. 



My heart pounding, I started to run. I crossed the street and kept 
running. 

But the shadows were closing in. Darkening. About to sweep over me. 

I knew I’d never make it home. 



20 


I was running as fast as I could. The dark hedges and trees flew by in a blur. 
My sneakers slapped the wet pavement loudly. 

I could feel the blood pulsing at my temples as my house came into 
view. The yellow porchlight made the front lawn glisten brightly. 

Almost there, I thought. Almost there. Please let me make it inside. 

A few seconds later, I was lurching up the driveway. I darted past the 
front walk, along the side of the house, and up to the kitchen door. 

With a final, desperate burst of energy, I pushed open the door with my 
shoulder, bolted into the kitchen, slammed the door behind me, and locked 
it. 

Gasping for breath, my chest heaving up and down, my throat dry and 
aching, I stood there for a long while, leaning my back against the door, 
struggling to catch my breath. 

It didn’t take me long to realize that no one had really been chasing 
me. I knew it was all my imagination. 

This had happened to me before. 

Lots of times. 

Why am I such a scaredy-cat? I asked myself, starting to feel a little 
more normal now that I was home safe and sound. 

And, then, standing in the empty kitchen, waiting for my heart to stop 
pounding, I realized what my friends and I had been doing wrong. I realized 
why we hadn’t been able to scare Courtney. 

“Eddie, is that you?” my mom called from the living room. 

“Yeah. I’m home,” I called back. I hurried through the hall and poked 
my head into the living room. “I just have to make one call,” I told her. 

“But you just got home—” Mom started to protest. 

I was already halfway up the stairs. “Just one call!” I shouted down. 

I flew into my room, grabbed the phone, and called Charlene. She 
picked up after the second ring. “Hello?” 

“We’ve been doing it all wrong!” I told her breathlessly. 

“Eddie? Are you home already? Did you run all the way?” 

“We’ve been doing it all wrong,” I repeated, ignoring her questions. 



“We’ve got to scare Courtney at night! At nightl Not in the daytime. 
Everything is scarier at night!” 

There was a brief silence. Charlene must have been thinking about 
what I was saying. Finally, she said, “You’re right, Eddie. Everything is a 
lot scarier at night. But we still don’t have any good ideas.” 

“Yeah, you’re right,” I admitted. 

“We can’t just jump out at Courtney in the dark and yell 'Boo!”’ 
Charlene said. 

Charlene was right. Nighttime was definitely the right time to scare 
Courtney. But we needed an idea. A really good, terrifying idea. 

Strangely enough, Courtney gave me the idea herself the next 
morning.

We were discussing monsters at morning meeting. 

We have morning meeting to start each day. We all gather in the 
meeting area at one end of the classroom. Mr. Melvin leans against the 
chalkboard or sits on a little three-legged stool he keeps there. And we 
discuss all kinds of things. 

Actually, the same three or four kids have the discussion. The rest of 
us just sit there and pretend to listen while we struggle to wake up. 

Of course Courtney is one of the big talkers. She’s always bright and 
enthusiastic, even first thing in the morning. And she’s never afraid to give 
her opinion on anything. 

Today, Mr. Melvin was telling us how people have always believed in 
monsters, since very early times. “People have a need to create monsters,” 
he said. “It helps us believe that the real world isn’t quite as scary. The real 
world isn’t as scary as the monsters we can dream up.” 

He went on like that for quite a while. I don’t think anyone was really 
listening. It was very early in the morning, after all. 

“There are countless legends and myths, stories and movies about 
monsters,” Mr. Melvin was saying. “But no one has ever proven that 
monsters exist. Mainly because they exist only in our imaginations.” 

“That’s not true,” Courtney interrupted. She always started talking 
without raising her hand first. She never cared if she was interrupting 
someone or not. 

Mr. Melvin’s bushy black eyebrows shot up on his shiny forehead. 
“Do you have proof that monsters exist, Courtney?” he asked. 

“Courtney’s a monster,” someone whispered behind me. I heard a few 
kids snicker. 

I was sitting on the window ledge. The morning sunlight through the 
window felt warm against my back. Molly was beside me, trying to unstick 
some gum from her braces. 

“My uncle is a scientist,” Courtney said. “He told me that the Loch 
Ness Monster in Scotland really exists. It lives in this big lake, and it looks 
like a sea serpent. And people have taken pictures of it.” 



“Those pictures aren’t really proof—” Mr. Melvin started. 

But Courtney kept going. She never stopped until she’d said all she 
had to say. “My uncle says that Bigfoot is real, too. He’s seen photos of 
Bigfoot’s footprints, taken in the Himalaya Mountains.” 

There were whispered comments around the room. I glanced at Hat, 
who was sitting on the floor in the middle of the meeting area, and he rolled 
his eyes at me. 

“People don’t just imagine all the monsters,” Courtney concluded. 
“They’re real. A lot of people are just too scared to admit that they’re real.” 

“That’s a very interesting theory,” Mr. Melvin said, scratching his 
neck. “Does anyone agree with Courtney? How many of you believe in 
monsters?” 

A few kids raised their hands. I didn’t notice how many. I was lost in 
my own thoughts. 

Courtney believes in monsters, I told myself. She really believes that 
monsters exist. 

Slowly, an idea began to hatch in my mind. 

Monsters... monsters... 

Monsters at night. In the dark... 

Thanks to Courtney, I was beginning to get the perfect plan for scaring 
her. The perfect plan that had to work!

I asked Kevin to help me, and he refused. So I brought Hat, Molly, and 
Charlene over to beg him. 

“Let me get this straight,” Kevin said, frowning at us. “You want me 
and two friends to get into our Mud Monster costumes and scare some girl 
in the woods?” 

“Not some girl,” I told him impatiently. “Courtney.” 

“She deserves to be scared,” Charlene quickly added. “Really. She’s 
been asking for it.” 

It was Saturday afternoon. We were standing in my back yard. Kevin 
had the garden hose in his hand. He did a lot of lawn chores on Saturdays. 
He was about to water the flower beds. 

“The video is all finished,” Kevin said, tightening the nozzle. “I’m 
glad I don’t have to get into that costume and put on all that drippy makeup 
again.” 

“Please!” I begged. 

“It’ll be fun,” Hat told Kevin. “It’ll be really funny.” 

Kevin turned the nozzle, but no water came out. 

“The hose is tangled,” I said, pointing. “Let me untangle it for you.” I 
bent down and started to work the knot out of the hose. 

“Courtney and her friend Denise have this tree house in the woods by 
Muddy Creek,” Charlene told Kevin. 

“I know,” Kevin replied. “We did our video there. We used the tree 
house in the video. The Mud Monsters climbed up into the tree house to 
murder a guy. It was cool.” 

“Great!” Molly cried. “How about an instant replay?” 

“Please!” I pleaded. I’d been doing a lot of pleading with Kevin ever 
since I got the idea. 

“So you want the three of us to wait in the woods at night, right?” 
Kevin asked. 

I untangled the hose. Water sprayed out onto Hat’s sneakers. 

He jumped back with a startled cry. We all laughed. 

“Sorry,” Kevin said, turning the spray on the flowers. “It was an 



accident.” 

“Yeah. You and your friends wait in the woods. Then, when it’s really 
dark, you come out and scare Courtney to death!” 

“You mean we make weird sounds and stagger around with slimy mud 
dripping off us and pretend to chase her,” Kevin said. 

“Right,” I replied eagerly. I could see he was starting to get interested. 

“How are you going to get her to the tree house at night?” Kevin 
asked. 

A good question. I hadn’t really thought about that. 

“I’ll get her there,” Molly said suddenly. She’d been very quiet all 
afternoon. 

“You’ll pretend to be Denise?” I asked. “That didn’t work out well last 
time.” 

“I won’t need to be Denise this time,” Molly said mysteriously. “Don’t 
worry. I’ll get her there.” 

Kevin raised the hose till the strong spray rose up the side of the 
house. He had his back turned to me. I couldn’t tell what he was thinking. 

“Well? Will you do it?” I asked, ready to start pleading and begging 
again. “Will you get your friends to help out, too?” 

“What’s in it for me?” Kevin asked without turning around. 

“Uh...” I thought quickly. “I’ll be your servant for a week, Kevin,” I 
said. “I’ll do all your lawn chores. I’ll mow the lawn. I’ll water and weed. 
And... I’ll do the dishes every night. And I’ll clean your room.” 

He turned and narrowed his eyes at me. “Get serious,” he muttered. 

“No. Really!” I insisted. “I’ll be a total servant. Total! For a whole 
week.” 

He turned off the nozzle. The water fizzled, then slowed to a drip. 
“How about for a month?” he said. 

Whoa. A month was a long time. A month of doing all of Kevin’s 
chores and jumping at his every command. A whole month... 

Was it worth it? Was it worth turning myself into a pitiful, overworked 
servant for a month just to scare Courtney? 

Of course it was! 

“Okay,” I said. “A month.” 

He grinned and shook my hand. His hand was wet from the hose. 

He handed the hose to me. “Take over, servant,” he ordered. 



I took the hose from him. Water dripped onto the front of my jeans. 
“When do you want the three Mud Monsters to appear?” Kevin asked. 
“When do you want to scare Courtney?” 

“Tomorrow night,” I replied.

Fm not really sure how the legend of the Mud Monsters got started. I heard 
about them first from another kid when I was little. The kid was trying to 
scare me, and he did a pretty good job of it. 

The legend goes something like this: 

Some early settlers of our town were too poor to build houses. So they 
set up little huts in the woods along the banks of Muddy Creek. 

The creek was much bigger then, much deeper and wider. It wasn’t 
just a muddy trickle of water the way it is today. 

The people were poor and hard-working and, pretty soon, they’d built 
an entire village of huts along the creek. But the people in town looked 
down on them. They refused to help them in any way. 

The town officials refused to share the city water supply with the 
Muddy Creek people. The store owners refused to let them buy anything on 
credit. 

Many of the Creek people were going hungry. Many of them were 
sick. But the town refused to help. 

This all happened over a hundred years ago. Maybe even longer. 

One night, there was a terrible rainstorm. Pouring rains and hurricane 
winds. 

Before the Creek people could run to safety, the creek rose up. The 
muddy banks towered up like a tidal wave, a tidal wave of heavy, black 
mud. 

The mud swept over the village. It buried all the huts and all the 
people. Like lava from a volcano, it buried everything beneath it. 

The next morning, there was nothing left of the village. The creek 
rolled by, high on its muddy banks. The woods were silent and empty. 

The village and all the people were gone. 

Only not completely. 

According to the legend, once a year when the moon is full, the 
villagers rise up from the mud. They’re monsters now, half-dead and half- 
alive. They’re Mud Monsters. 

And once a year the Mud Monsters pull themselves up from their 



muddy graves to dance in the moonlight—and to seek revenge on the 
townspeople who refused to help them. 

That’s the local legend, as much as I know of it. 

Of course it isn’t true. But it’s a really good story, I think. And it’s 
been told again and again, passed on from one generation to the next. 

The story has scared an awful lot of kids. Including me. 

And now, on Sunday night, Kevin and his two fellow Mud Monsters 
were about to terrify Courtney, the girl who couldn’t be terrified. 

At a little after seven, Kevin was in the bathroom, putting the finishing 
touches on his costume. He had thick, brownish-orange mud caked over his 
face and hair. He wore a loose-fitting black shirt over baggy black jeans. 
His clothing was dripping with mud, too. 

I stepped into the doorway and examined him as he piled more thick 
goo onto his hair. “Yuck. You really look gross,” I told him. 

“Thanks, punk,” he replied. “Did you finish loading the dishwasher?” 

“Yes,” I said grudgingly. 

“And did you collect all my dirty clothes from my room and put them 
in the hamper?” 

“Yes,” I muttered. 

“Yes, sir,” he corrected me. “A servant should always be polite.” 

“Yes, sir,” I repeated. He had been running me ragged ever since I’d 
agreed to be his servant. It was truly unbelievable how many chores he 
found for me to do! 

But now the big moment was rapidly approaching, the moment that 
would make my month of drudgery worthwhile. 

Kevin turned to me. “How do I look?” 

“Like a pile of mud,” I replied. 

He smiled. “Thanks.” I followed him down to the front hall. He picked 
up the car keys from the little table. “I’m going to drive over and pick up 
my two friends,” he said, admiring his gruesome appearance in the hall 
mirror. “Then we’ll find hiding places in the woods. Want a lift?” 

I shook my head. “No. Thanks. I’ve got to go to Molly’s first. There’s 
one little detail we have to take care of.” 

“What’s that?” Kevin asked. 

“Getting Courtney to the woods,” I replied. 



24 


“Hi, Eddie. What’s going on?” Molly’s dad asked. 

We were standing in Molly’s kitchen. Her dad pulled open the 
refrigerator and removed a can of ginger ale. Then he searched the shelves, 
squinting into the light. 

“Nothing much, Dad,” Molly replied nervously. “Eddie and I are just 
hanging out.” 

He turned away from the refrigerator. “You two want to play some 
Scrabble or something?” 

“No. No thanks,” Molly replied quickly. “Not tonight, okay?” 

I glanced up at the kitchen clock. It was getting late. We didn’t have 
time for any long discussions with Molly’s dad. We had to get Courtney to 
the woods. 

“How about some card games?” her dad said, sticking his head back in 
the refrigerator. “You’ve been wanting me to teach you poker. I don’t have 
much to do tonight, so—” 

“Eddie and I have to talk about stuff,” Molly said. “And... uh... we 
have to call some kids.” 

Her dad looked hurt. He pulled some cold cuts from the fridge and 
started to make a sandwich. “You two hungry?” 

“No. We’re not,” Molly replied impatiently. She pulled me toward the 

den. 

“Molly, we’ve got to hurry,” I whispered. 

“Tell me about it,” Molly said dryly. She pushed her glasses up on her 
nose. “Here. You can listen on this phone, Eddie. I’ll go upstairs and call 
Courtney.” 

“What are you going to say? You’re not going to pretend to be 
Denise?” I was starting to feel really nervous. We should have called 
Courtney a lot earlier. We shouldn’t have waited until the last minute. 

Molly flashed me a mysterious smile. “You’ll see,” she said slyly. 
Then she disappeared upstairs. 

I paced back and forth in the den for a minute or so, giving Molly time 
enough to dial. Then I carefully picked up the receiver and held it to my ear. 



Molly already had Courtney on the phone. “Who is this?” Courtney 
was asking. 

“It’s Molly,” was the reply. 

I held my breath. Why was Molly telling Courtney the truth? 

“Hi, Molly. What’s up?” Courtney asked, surprise in her voice. She 
and Molly had never exactly been pals. 

“I heard something I thought you’d be interested in,” Molly said 
breathlessly. “I just heard that the Mud Monsters are supposed to appear at 
the creek tonight.” 

There was a long silence on Courtney’s end. Finally, she said, “This is 
a joke, right?” 

“No,” Molly answered quickly. “I really heard it. They said it’s a full 
moon, and this is the night the Mud Monsters rise up every year.” 

“Molly, give me a break,” Courtney said sarcastically. “Come on. 
Why’d you call me?” 

She isn’t buying it, I thought, gripping the phone tightly, too nervous 
to breathe. Courtney isn’t buying it. Molly’s idea is a flop. 

“Well, Courtney, you said in school that you believed in monsters,” 
Molly said. “And so when I heard about the Mud Monsters, I thought you 
would be really desperate to see them.” 

“Where did you hear about this?” Courtney demanded suspiciously. 

“On the radio,” Molly lied. “I just heard it on the radio. They said the 
Mud Monsters were going to rise up in the woods tonight when the moon is 
up.” 

“Well, you go,” Courtney said coldly. “You can tell me about it in 
school on Monday.” 

Oh, no, I thought. Failure. Total failure. The whole plan is a bust. My 
brother is going to kill me! 

“Well, I might go,” Molly told Courtney, not giving up. “I mean, you 
don’t get a chance to see real monsters very often. But if you’re scared, 
Courtney, you should stay home.” 

“Huh? What did you just say?” Courtney demanded, her voice rising 
shrilly. 

“I said,” Molly repeated, “if you’re too scared, you definitely should 
stay away from the woods.” 

“Me? Scared?” Courtney’s voice was almost high enough for only 



dogs to hear. “I’m not scared of any Mud Monsters, Molly. I’ll see you 
there in ten minutes. Unless you ’re too scared.” 

“No. Really. Stay home,” Molly told Courtney. “I don’t want to be 
responsible. If you start to panic and you get hurt—” 

“See you there,” Courtney said sharply. She hung up. 

A few seconds later, Molly returned to the den with a wide, pleased 
smile on her face. “Am I a genius, or what?” she asked. 

“You’re a genius,” I replied. “Let’s get going.” 



25 


I felt a cold shiver as Molly and I neared the woods at Muddy Creek. The 
air was surprisingly cool and damp. Slender wisps of black clouds floated 
over the full moon, which still hovered low over the trees. 

“This is exciting,” Molly said, her eyes searching the dark trees ahead 
of us. “I can’t believe we’re finally going to scare Courtney.” 

“I can’t believe it, either,” I said. “I just keep wondering what will go 
wrong this time.” 

“Nothing will go wrong,” Molly assured me. “Stop being such a 
pessimist. Tonight’s the night, Eddie.” 

Charlene and Hat were waiting for us at the edge of the woods. Molly 
saw them first and waved. We both began jogging over to them. 

“Have you seen my brother and his two friends?” I asked, gazing 
toward the dark woods. 

“No,” Hat replied. 

“But we saw Courtney,” Charlene reported. 

“She and Denise were hurrying to the tree house.” 

“She brought Denise?” I cried. “Great! We’ll terrify Denise, too!” 

“Did they see you?” Molly asked Charlene. 

“No way,” Charlene replied. “Hat and I hid. Over there.” She pointed 
to a cluster of thick shrubs. 

The woods suddenly grew brighter. I glanced up to see that the wispy 
clouds had rolled away from the moon. Pale yellow light, eerie light, 
washed over us. 

The trees suddenly shook in a gust of wind. It sounded like whispering 
all around us. 

“My brother and his friends must be hiding down by the creek,” I said. 
“Come on. Let’s go. We don’t want to miss the big moment.” 

The four of us made our way through the trees. We tried to walk 
silently, but twigs and dried leaves crackled noisily under our sneakers. 

I gasped when I heard a soft moan. 

A haunting, sad cry. Mournful. 

I stopped and listened. Another moan. 



“Wh-what’s that?” I stammered in a choked whisper. 

“Sounds like a bird. A dove, maybe,” Charlene replied. 

Another moan. Yes. It was a dove, up in a tree. 

“Hey, Eddie, you’re not freaking already, are you?” Hat demanded. He 
slapped me hard on the back. “You’ve got to keep it together, man.” 

“ I’m together,” I muttered. I felt embarrassed that I’d panicked over a 
stupid dove. I was glad it was too dark for them to see me blushing. 

I reached out and flipped Hat’s cap around, just to get my mind off the 
dove. 

“Hey!” Hat cried out, spinning around angrily. 

“Ssshhh. Quiet. Courtney and Denise will hear us,” Molly scolded. 

We made our way quickly toward the tree house. The woods grew 
darker as we crept under the whispering trees. We huddled closer together 
as we walked. No one whispered or spoke. 

I heard more low moans. Soft cries. 

I forced myself to ignore them. I wasn’t going to allow myself to be 
frightened by any more birds. 

It seemed as if we had walked for hours, but I knew it had only been a 
couple of minutes. My throat felt dry, and my knees were a little shaky. Just 
from the excitement, I guessed. 

“Oh!” I cried out as I tripped over something, a raised tree root or a 
rock. I went sprawling in the dirt face first. “Ow.” 

Hat and Charlene pulled me up quickly. “Are you okay?” Charlene 
whispered. 

“Yeah. Fine,” I muttered, brushing myself off. I had landed hard on my 
right elbow, and it was throbbing like crazy. 

“Stop trying to scare us,” Charlene scolded me. 

“I’m not,” I protested. Rubbing my aching elbow, I followed them 
along the path. 

We stopped at the edge of the clearing. Keeping in the darkness of the 
trees, we stared out at the tree house. 

It was more like a platform with walls than a house. I mean, it didn’t 
have a roof or anything. Courtney and Denise were perched in it, leaning 
against one side. 

Moonlight washed over the clearing, and I could see them both clearly. 
Courtney had a pair of binoculars up to her eyes. Denise was shining a 



flashlight into the trees. She had a camera around her neck. 

Perfect, I thought, snickering to myself. They always have to be the 
perfect scientists. I was surprised they hadn’t made work sheets so they 
could check off the Mud Monsters when they saw them. Under wildlife! 

My three friends and I squatted down behind a clump of tall weeds and 
watched them. Courtney and Denise kept chatting as they peered out over 
the tree house wall. But I couldn’t hear what they were saying. 

“I can’t wait!” Hat whispered, leaning toward me. His dark eyes 
flashed excitedly under the brim of his cap. He was furiously chewing a big 
wad of gum. “Where’s your brother?” he asked. 

My eyes searched the trees that lined the creek bed just behind the 
clearing. “I don’t see him,” I whispered to Hat. “But he and his friends are 
there somewhere. And they’re going to come walking out any minute.” 

“And then the fun will begin,” Hat whispered, grinning. 

“Yeah,” I agreed. “Then the fun will begin.” 

But I had this gnawing doubt, a heavy feeling of dread. 

Where were Kevin and his friends? 

Where were they? 

And then I saw something moving behind the tree house at the edge of 
the clearing. 



26 


I grabbed Hat’s sleeve when I saw the moving shadows near the trees. 
“Look!” I whispered, my heart pounding. I pointed across the clearing. 

But I didn’t need to point. He saw them, too. We all saw them. 

Courtney and Denise were facing the other direction, unaware that 
something was happening behind them. 

I stared hard, holding my breath, keeping low behind the weeds. 

I saw a dark figure moving slowly toward the tree house. 

Then I saw another figure behind it. It seemed to be pulling itself up 
from the mud. 

A third figure staggered into the light. 

Yes! 

The three Mud Monsters! 

Kevin and his friends had come through for us! 

Courtney and Denise still didn’t see them. 

Courtney was leaning on the tree house wall, peering through the 
binoculars. 

Denise was aiming the flashlight in the other direction. 

I could see Kevin and his friends clearly now. They looked great! 

Their heads were covered with wet, dark mud. Their clothes appeared 
tattered and decayed. 

Dripping mud, they staggered forward, like zombies, with their arms 
outstretched. 

Closer. Closer to the tree house. 

Turn around! I silently urged Courtney and Denise. 

Turn around—and start screaming your heads off! 

But Courtney and Denise still didn’t turn around. They still had no 
idea the three gmesome Mud Monsters were sneaking up behind them. 

I turned and glanced quickly at my three friends. Molly and Charlene 
were frozen like statues, their mouths wide open, their eyes bulging, 
enjoying the show. Hat stared without blinking. Watching gleefully. 
Waiting. 



We were all waiting for our two victims to realize the Mud Monsters 
were approaching. 

Suddenly, as I stared at the three staggering Mud Monsters in the 
clearing, I heard a rustling sound behind me. 

Crackling twigs. The scrape of shoes against the ground. 

Footsteps. 

Low murmuring voices. 

“Huh?” With a gasp of surprise, I turned back. 

And saw three other Mud Monsters standing behind us! 

“No!” I tried to scream, but my voice came out a choked whisper. 

Hat, Molly, and Charlene spun around as the three new Mud Monsters 
moved closer. 

And I recognized Kevin in the middle of them. 

“K-Kevin!” I stammered. 

“Sorry, punk,” Kevin whispered. “But we had a flat tire.” 



27 


“Are we too late?” Kevin asked. 

I didn’t reply. I couldn’t. 

I turned back to the clearing. The three Mud Monsters were staggering 
right behind the tree house. Their sunken eyes peered out from the wet mud 
that dripped down their faces. 

And then I saw more of them. I saw arms poking up from the dirt. I 
saw mud-covered heads appear. More and more bodies rose up silently 
from the marshy ground. 

Dark figures, dripping with thick mud, pushed themselves up and 
began staggering across the clearing. Their bare feet slapped the mud as 
they walked. 

There were dozens of them now. Skinny, scraggly, twisted, mud- 
drenched bodies, all lurching toward the tree house. Dozens. And dozens 
more, pulling themselves up from under the ground. 

“Run!” I screamed, jumping out from behind the weeds. “Courtney! 
Denise! Run! Run!” 

They hesitated. Then they finally saw the hideous monsters. 

Courtney’s shrill scream rang out through the trees. 

She screamed out in terror. Again. And then again. 

She and Denise were both screaming. 

It should have been our big moment, our triumph. 

But it wasn’t. 

The two girls screamed in shrill horror. 

And then I realized we were all screaming. 

Their feet smacking wetly over the ground, the Mud Monsters 
staggered forward. 

I saw Courtney and Denise leap to the ground. 

And then I saw them running, screaming in terror as they ran. 

And then I was running, too. Running through the dark trees. Running 
from the woods. 

Running. Running. Running from the mud-covered monsters I knew 
I’d never forget, no matter how far I ran. 



Well, that all happened two weeks ago. Two long weeks ago. 

The horror is over. It’s all behind us. 

But I still don’t go out much. I really don’t like to leave the house. 
Neither do my friends. 

Yesterday, Kevin asked me if I wanted to see his Mud Monsters video. 
It’s all edited and finished, he said. 

I told him no thanks. I really don’t want to watch it. 

I’ve been very nervous and tense since that night in the woods. 

My friends have been nervous and tense, too. We’re all totally stressed 

out. 

Except for Courtney. 

You know what Courtney has been doing? She’s been bragging to 
everyone that she was right. That there really are monsters in the world. 

Courtney’s been bragging to everyone how she proved there are real 
monsters because she saw them. 

She’s worse than ever. 

My friends and I, we’d really like to give Courtney a good scare. 

We’d really like to scare Courtney once and for all. 

But we can’t. We’re just too scared.

ONE DAY AT 
HORRORLAND 


Goosebumps - 16 
R.L. Stine 





1 


As we entered the gates to HorrorLand, we had no idea that, in just a few hours, 
we would all be lying in our coffins. 

I’m the calm one in the Morris family. Everyone says, “Lizzy, you’re the 
calm one.” And I’m trying to tell this story calmly. 

But believe me—there’s no way! 

We had never planned to go to HorrorLand. In fact, we’d never heard of it. 

The five of us were squeezed into Dad’s little Toyota, on our way to spend 
the day at Zoo Gardens Theme Park. Dad had messed up and left the map at 
home. But Mom said the park would be real easy to find. 

When we got close to the park, Mom said, there would be lots of signs to 
direct us. But so far we hadn’t seen a single sign. 

Dad was driving, and Mom was beside him in the front. I was squeezed in 
back with my little brother, Luke, who is ten, and Luke’s friend Clay. 

It wasn’t the best place to be. My brother cannot sit still for a second. 
Especially in the car. He just has too much energy. And he’s totally goofy. 

The longer we drove, the more restless Luke became. He tried wrestling 
with Clay, but there really wasn’t room. Then he tried arm wrestling with him, 
and the two of them kept bumping me until I lost my temper and started shouting 
at them to stop. 

“Why don’t you three play Alphabet?” Mom suggested from the front. 
“Look out the window for letters.” 

“There aren’t any,” Luke replied. “There aren’t any signs.” 

“There isn’t anything to look at,” Clay grumbled. 

He was right. We were driving past flat, sandy fields. There were a few 
scraggly trees here and there. The rest was all desert. 

“I’m going to take this turnoff,” Dad announced. He took off his Chicago 
Cubs cap and scratched his thinning blond hair. “Haven’t I already taken this 
turnoff?” 

Dad is the only blond in the family. Mom, Luke, and I all have straight 
black hair and blue eyes. 

In fact, Dad doesn’t look as if he belongs in the same family. The three of 
us are tall and thin, with very fair skin. And Dad is short and kind of chubby, 



with a round face that’s almost always pink. I tease him all the time because I 
think he looks a lot more like a wrestler than a bank manager, which he is. 

“I’m pretty sure we’ve already been here,” Dad said unhappily. 

“It’s hard to tell. It’s all desert,” Mom replied, gazing out her window. 

“Very helpful,” Dad muttered. 

“How can I be helpful?” Mom shot back. “You’re the one who left the map 
on the kitchen table.” 

“I thought you packed it,” Dad grumbled. 

“Why should it be my job to pack the map?” Mom cried. 

“Break it up, you two,” I interrupted. Once they start fighting, they never 
stop. It’s always best to interrupt them quickly before they really get into it. 

“I’m the Mad Pincher!” Luke cried. He let out a gruesome, horror-movie 
laugh and started pinching Clay’s ribs and arms. 

I hate Luke’s Mad Pincher routine more than anything. I was so glad that 
Clay was sitting in the middle next to Luke and not me. Usually, the only way to 
stop Luke’s pinching is to slug him. 

Clay started squirming and laughing. He thinks everything Luke does is a 
riot. He laughs at all of my brother’s stupid jokes and stunts. I think that’s why 
Luke likes Clay so much. 

The two of them began pinching each other. 

Then Luke shoved Clay into me. “Give me a break!” I cried. 

I shoved Clay back. I know I shouldn’t have. But it was getting hot in the 
car, and we’d been driving for hours, and what was I supposed to do? 

“Lizzy! Boys! Chill out back there!” Dad cried. 

“Dad, nobody says ‘chill out’ anymore,” I told him calmly and quietly. 

For some reason, that made him go berserk. He started yelling, and his face 
got bright red. 

I knew he wasn’t mad at me. He was mad because he couldn’t find Zoo 
Gardens Theme Park. 

“Everybody just take a deep breath and be silent,” Mom suggested. 

“Ow! Stop pinching me!” Clay screamed. He gave Luke a hard shove. 

“You stop pinching me!” my brother shrieked, shoving him back. 

Boys can really be animals. 

“Hey, look—a sign up ahead!” Mom pointed as a large green sign came 
into view. 

Luke and Clay stopped fighting. Dad leaned forward over the steering 



wheel, squinting through the windshield. 

“Does it say where the park is?” Luke demanded. 

“Does it say where we are?” Clay asked. 

The words on the sign came into view as we drove past it. It read: SIGN 
FOR RENT. 

We all let out disappointed groans. 

“The Mad Pincher returns!” Luke cried. He gave Clay a hard pinch on the 
arm. Luke never knows when to quit. 

“This road isn’t going anywhere,” Dad said, scowling. “I’ll have to turn 
around and get back on the highway. If I can find it.” 

“I think you should ask someone for directions,” Mom suggested. 

“Ask someone? Ask someone?” Dad exploded. “Do you see anyone I can 
ask?” His face was bright red again. He drove with one hand so he could use the 
other to shake a fist. 

“I meant if you see a gas station,” Mom murmured. 

“A gas station?” Dad screamed. “I don’t even see a tree!” 

Dad was right. I stared out the window and saw nothing but white sand on 
both sides of the road. The sun beamed down on it, making it gleam. The sand 
was so bright, it nearly looked like snow. 

“I meant to go north,” Dad muttered. “The desert is south. We must have 
gone south.” 

“You’d better turn around,” Mom urged. 

“Are we lost?” Clay asked. I could hear some fear in his voice. 

Clay isn’t the bravest kid in the world. In fact, he is pretty easy to scare. 
Once I crept up behind him in our backyard at night and whispered his name— 
and he almost jumped right out of his shoes! 

“Dad, are we lost?” Luke repeated the question. 

“Yeah, we’re lost,” Dad replied quietly. “Hopelessly lost.” 

Clay let out a soft cry and slumped in the seat. He looked a little like a 
balloon deflating. 

“Don’t tell him that!” Mom cried sharply. 

“What should I tell him?” Dad snapped back. “We’re nowhere near Zoo 
Gardens. We’re nowhere near civilization! We’re in the desert, going nowhere!” 

“Just turn around. I’m sure we’ll find someone we can ask,” Mom said 
softly. “And stop being so dramatic.” 

“We’re all going to die in the desert,” Luke said, with a gmesome grin on 



his face. “And buzzards will peck out our eyeballs and eat our flesh.” 

My brother has a great sense of humor, doesn’t he? 

You can’t imagine what it’s like having to live with a total ghoul! 

“Luke, stop scaring Clay,” Mom said, turning in her seat to glare at Luke. 

“I’m not scared,” Clay insisted. But he looked scared. His round face was 
kind of pale. And his eyes were blinking a lot behind his glasses. With his short, 
feathery blond hair and round eyeglasses, Clay looked a lot like a frightened 
owl. 

Muttering to himself, Dad slowed the car to a stop. Then he turned it 
around, and we headed back in the direction we had come. “Great vacation,” he 
said through clenched teeth. 

“It’s still early,” Mom told him, checking her watch. 

The late morning sun was nearly straight overhead. I could feel its warmth 
on my face through the open sunroof. 

We drove for nearly half an hour. Luke wanted to play Twenty Questions or 
Geography with Clay. But Clay moodily said no. He just stared out the window, 
watching the desert roll by. Every few minutes, he’d ask, “Are we still lost?” 

“Pretty lost,” my dad would reply unhappily. 

“We’re okay,” Mom kept reassuring us. 

As we drove, the scraggly trees reappeared. Then, after a while, the sand 
gave way to darker fields, dotted with trees and low shrubs. 

I sat silently, my hands clasped in my lap, staring out the window. I wasn’t 
really scared or worried. But I wished we would at least see a gas station or a 
store or one other human being! 

“I’m getting hungry,” Luke griped. “Is it lunchtime?” 

With a long sigh that sounded like air escaping from a tire, Dad pulled the 
car to the side of the road. He reached across Mom to the glove compartment. 
“There’s got to be some kind of map in there,” he said. 

“No. I already looked,” Mom told him. 

As they started to argue, I raised my eyes to the open sunroof above my 
head. 

“Oh!” I let out a cry as I saw a hideous monster staring down at me, 
lowering its enormous head, about to crush the car.

I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. 

The monster glared down at me through the sunroof. It was as tall as a 
building, I realized. Its red eyes glowed with evil, and its mouth was twisted in a 
hungry grin. 

“D-Dad!” I finally managed to stammer. Dad was bent over, fumbling 
through the papers in the glove compartment. 

“Wow!” I heard Luke cry. 

I turned and saw that Luke was staring up at it, too, his blue eyes wide with 
fright. 

“Dad? Mom?” My heart was pounding so hard, I thought my chest might 
explode. 

“Lizzy, what is it?” Mom asked impatiently. 

The monster lowered its head over us. Its mouth opened wide, ready to 
swallow the whole car. 

And then Luke started to laugh. “Wow! Cool!” he cried. 

And I realized at the same time that the monster wasn’t alive. It was a 
mechanical figure, part of a giant billboard display. 

Ducking my head to get a better view through the side window, I saw that 
Dad had pulled the car up right beside the billboard. My parents were so busy 
arguing about maps, they hadn’t even noticed it! 

I stared up at the red-eyed monster. It lowered its head and opened its jaws. 
Then the jaws snapped shut, and the enormous head slid back up. 

“It looks so real!” Clay exclaimed, staring up at it. 

“Didn’t fool me,” I lied. I wasn’t going to admit that I nearly leaped out 
through the sunroof. I’m supposed to be the calm one, after all. 

I rolled down the window and stuck my head out to read the billboard in 
front of the mechanical monster. In huge red letters it said: WELCOME TO 
HORRORLAND, WHERE NIGHTMARES COME TO LIFE! 

There was a dark red arrow in the upper left-hand corner with the words: 
ONE MILE. 

“Can we go there?” Luke demanded eagerly. He leaned forward and 
grabbed the back of Dad’s seat with both hands. “Can we, Dad? How about it?” 



“It looks kind of scary,” Clay said softly. 

Dad slammed the glove compartment shut with a sigh. He was giving up on 
the map idea. “Luke, stop pulling my seat,” he snapped. “Sit back.” 

“Can we go to HorrorLand?” Luke asked. 

“HorrorLand? What’s HorrorLand?” Mom demanded. 

“Never heard of it,” Dad muttered. 

“It’s only a mile from here,” Luke pleaded. “It looks great!” 

The monster lowered its head over the car, staring in through the sunroof. 
Then it raised its head again. 

“I don’t think so,” Mom said, looking out at the huge billboard. “Zoo 
Gardens is such a wonderful park. HorrorLand doesn’t look very nice.” 

“It looks great!” Luke insisted, pulling at Dad’s seat back again. “It looks 
really excellent!” 

“Luke, sit back,” Dad pleaded. 

“Let’s go,” I urged. “We’re never going to find Zoo Gardens.” 

Mom hesitated, chewing her lower lip. “I don’t know,” she said fretfully. 
“Some of these places aren’t safe.” 

“It’ll be safe!” Luke declared. “It’ll be very safe!” 

“Luke—sit back!” Dad growled. 

“Can we go?” Luke demanded, ignoring Dad’s request. “Can we?” 

“It could be fun,” Clay said quietly. 

“Let’s give it a try,” I urged them. “If we hate it, we can always leave.” 

Dad rubbed his chin. He sighed. “Well, I guess it would be better than 
sitting here in the middle of nowhere arguing all day.” 

“YAAAAAY!” Luke screamed. 

Luke and I reached over Clay to slap each other a high five. HorrorLand 
sounded like a pretty cool place to me, too. I love scary rides. 

“If the rides are as scary as that monster,” I said, pointing at the billboard, 
“this park will be awesome!” 

“You don’t think it’s too scary—do you?” Clay asked. I saw that he had his 
hands clasped tightly in his lap. And he had that frightened owl look on his face 
again. 

“No, it won’t be too scary,” I told him. 

Oh, wow—was I wrong ! 


“I can’t believe someone would build a big theme park out in the wilderness,” 



Dad declared. 

We were driving through what seemed like an endless forest. Tall old trees 
leaned over the two-lane road, nearly blocking out the late morning sun. 

“Maybe they haven’t built the park yet,” Mom suggested. “Maybe they’re 
going to clear out these trees and build the park here.” 

All three of us in the backseat were hoping Mom was wrong. And she was. 

The road curved sharply. And as we came out of the curve, we saw the tall 
gates to the park straight up ahead. 

Behind a tall purple fence, HorrorLand seemed to stretch for miles. Leaning 
forward in my seat, I could see the tops of rides and strange, colorful buildings. 
As we drove across the enormous parking lot, eerie chords of organ music 
invaded the car. 

“YAAAAAY! This looks great!” Luke exclaimed. 

Clay and I enthusiastically agreed. I couldn’t wait to get out of the car and 
see everything. 

“The parking lot is nearly empty,” Dad said, glancing uneasily at Mom. 

“That means we won’t have to wait in long lines!” I quickly exclaimed. 

“I think Lizzy is excited about this place,” Mom commented, smiling. 

“Me, too!” Luke cried. He punched Clay enthusiastically on the shoulder. 
Luke always has to be punching or pinching somebody. 

We crossed the wide parking lot. I saw a few cars parked near the front 
gate. At the far side of the lot stood a row of purple-and-green buses with the 
word HORRORLAND across the side. 

As we rode closer, I got a good look at the front gate. The same monster we 
had seen behind the billboard rose up behind a big purple-and-green sign over 
the gate. The sign read: THE HORRORLAND HORRORS WELCOME YOU 
TO HORRORLAND! 

“I don’t get that sign,” Mom said. “What are the HorrorLand Horrors?” 

“We’ll find out!” I exclaimed happily. 

The solemn, eerie organ music floated heavily over the parking lot. Dad 
pulled into a space in an empty aisle to the right of the front gate. 

Luke and I pushed open the back doors before the car had even stopped. 
“Let’s go!” I cried. 

Luke, Clay, and I started trotting toward the gate. As I ran, I stared up at the 
green monster over the sign. This one didn’t move its head like the billboard 
monster. But it looked very real. 



I glanced back and saw that Mom and Dad were hurrying to catch up with 
us. “This is going to be way cool!” I exclaimed. 

And then I gasped as a deafening explosion made the ground shake. 

And I stared back in horror as our car burst apart, exploding into a million 
pieces.

It took me a long while to stop screaming. Finally, I swallowed hard, choking 
back my cries. 

We all stared in shock. Small chunks of twisted metal and a few burning 
cinders were all that was left of our car. 

“How—?” was all Dad managed to say. 

“I—I d-don’t believe it!” I stammered. 

“Thank goodness we were all out of the car!” Mom cried. She gathered us 
up in a big hug. “Thank goodness we’re all okay.” 

Luke and Clay still hadn’t uttered a sound. They stood wide-eyed, staring at 
the spot where the car had stood. 

“My car!” Dad choked out in a horrified whisper. “My car... How? How?” 

“We’re safe,” Mom murmured. “We’re all safe. What a terrifying explosion. 
I can’t get the sound of it out of my ears.” 

“I—I’ve got to call the police!” Dad sputtered. 

He began trotting to the gate, shaking his head, muttering to himself. 

“How could the car just blow up like that, dear?” Mom asked, hurrying 
after him. “What would make it do that?” 

“How should I know?” Dad snapped angrily. “I—I don’t get it! I really 
don’t! And now what are we going to do?” He sounded really panicked. 

I didn’t blame him. The explosion was really scary. 

And when I realized that we could have all been inside the car when it went 
off, I had cold chills down my back. 

“Maybe there’s a car rental place we can call,” Mom suggested. 

Mom is like me, calm in any emergency. 

We followed Dad as he went running up to the ticket booth at the entrance. 
A green monster stood in the booth. He had bulging yellow eyes and dark horns 
curled over his head. It was a really great costume. 

“Welcome to HorrorLand,” he said in a gruff, low voice. A loud stab of 
organ music rose up from inside the ticket booth. “I am a HorrorLand Horror. 
All of the Horrors and I hope you have a scary day.” 

“My car!” Dad cried frantically “There was an explosion. I need a phone!” 

“I’m sorry, sir. No phones,” the guy in the monster costume replied. 



“Huh?” Dad’s face was bright red again. His forehead was drenched with 
sweat. “But I need a phone! Right away!” Dad insisted, glaring angrily at the 
green monster. “My car exploded! We’re stuck here!” 

“We’ll take care of you,” the Horror replied, lowering his gruff voice nearly 
to a whisper. 

“You’ll what? Dad cried. “We need a car. I need to get to a phone! Don’t 
you understand?” 

“No phones,” the monster repeated. “But, please, sir. Allow us to take care 
of you. I promise we will take care of everything. Don’t let this spoil your visit 
to HorrorLand.” 

“Spoil my visit?!” Dad shrieked, his face growing even redder. “But my car 

_ !” 

Another loud stab of organ music made me jump. The creepy music made 
me feel as if I were actually in a horror movie! 

“We will take care of you. I promise,” the Horror said. A strange smile 
crossed his face. His yellow eyes lit up. “Please enjoy your stay, and do not 
worry about transportation. The other Horrors and I will see that you are 
properly taken care of.” 

“But—but—” Dad sputtered. 

The Horror gestured toward the park. “Please enter as our guests. Free 
admission. I apologize for your car. But, please, do not worry. I promise you will 
have no need to worry about your car.” 

Dad turned back to us, sweat dripping down his forehead. I could see that 
he was really upset. “I—I can’t enjoy an amusement park now,” he said. “I can’t 
believe this happened. I really can’t. We’ve got to get a car somehow, and—” 

“Oh, please, Dad!” Luke cried. “Please! Can’t we go inside? He said he’ll 
take care of it for us.” 

“Just for a little while?” I joined my brother in pleading. 

“We’ve had such a long drive,” Mom told Dad. “Let’s go in for a short 
while. Let them blow off some steam.” 

Dad thought about it, frowning hard. “Okay. Just for a little while,” he 
agreed finally. 

The organ music grew louder as we stepped through the gate. “Wow! Look 
at this place!” I cried. “It really is like being in a horror movie.” 

We were standing on a brown cobbled street. Strange dark cottages tilted up 
on both sides of the street. Tall trees along the street nearly blocked out all the 



sunlight. The air carried a chill. 

Low howls, like wolf howls, floated out from the cottages. 

“Cool!” Luke declared. 

A sign proclaimed: WELCOME TO WEREWOLF VILLAGE. DO NOT 
FEED THE WEREWOLVES. IF YOU CAN HELP IT. 

The frightening howls grew louder. 

Luke and I laughed at the sign. 

I saw a green monster, one of the Horrors, staring out at us through a dark 
window in the cottage across the narrow street. Another Horror walked past 
carrying a very real-looking human head. He grasped it by its long blond hair 
and bounced it up and down, sort of like a yo-yo, as he walked. 

“Cool!” Luke proclaimed again. It seemed to be his word of the day. 

We walked along the cobbled street. The sound of our thudding sneakers 
echoed off the cottage walls. 

“Ohh!” We ah let out cries of surprise as a long, low, gray wolf ran in front 
of us. It disappeared around the side of a cottage before we really got a good 
look at it. 

“Was that a real wolf?” Clay asked, his voice shaking. 

“Of course not,” I told him. “It was probably a dog. Or else it was 
mechanical.” 

“Well, they certainly keep this park clean,” Mom said, trying to sound 
cheerful. “There isn’t a piece of trash or dirt anywhere. Of course, it isn’t very 
crowded.” 

Dad lingered behind. “I—I’ve got to find a phone,” he said fretfully. “I 
can’t enjoy this until I know we have a way to get home.” 

“But, dear—” Mom started. 

“There’s got to be a phone somewhere,” Dad interrupted. “Go on without 

me.” 

“No. I’ll come with you,” Mom said. “You’re in such a frantic state. You’ll 
need me to make the calls for you. The kids will have a better time without us 
hanging around anyway.” 

“Leave them?” Dad cried. “You mean, let them go on their own?” 

“Of course,” Mom said, hurrying back to him. “They’ll be perfectly fine. 
This looks like a very nice place. What could happen?” 

What could happen? 

With those words, Mom and Dad rushed off to find a phone. 



“Meet back here!” Mom called to us. 

Luke, Clay, and I were suddenly on our own. 

I turned to watch Mom and Dad hurry away. 

I turned back in time to see a gray wolf edging out from behind the cottage. 
It lowered its head and let out a rumbling warning growl. 

All three of us froze as we realized its hungry red eyes were locked on us.

I cried out and pulled Luke and Clay back. 

The wolf slithered out, holding its head low, glaring up at us with wide red 
eyes, its mouth open hungrily. 

“It—it’s real!” Clay declared, swallowing hard. I had my hand on his 
shoulder. I could feel him trembling. 

The wolf let out a deep growl. 

Then it slid back behind the cottage wall. 

“I think it’s some kind of robot or something,” I told Clay. 

“Let’s go somewhere else,” Clay replied, suddenly very pale. 

“What does that sign up there say?” Luke asked. He went running over the 
dark cobblestones to the sign, and Clay and I followed. 

The sign read: NO PINCHING. 

Luke laughed. “That’s stupid.” 

“What a dumb sign!” Clay agreed. 

“That sign was meant just for you, Luke!” I exclaimed. I gave him a hard 
pinch on the arm. 

“Hey! Can’t you read?” he shouted angrily, pointing to the sign. 

I saw a green Horror watching us from down the street. Then I saw a family 
making its way behind the row of cottages. There was a mother, a father, and a 
little girl. The little girl was crying for some reason. The parents had their hands 
on her shoulders and looked very upset. 

A wolf howl cut through the air. 

“Let’s find some rides!” Clay suggested. 

“Some scary rides!” Luke added. 

Walking side by side, keeping close together, we made our way out of the 
Werewolf Village. The street widened into a round plaza. Bright sunlight 
returned as soon as we stepped out of the village. 

Several purple-and-green buildings surrounded the plaza. I saw a few more 
families and several green-costumed Horrors keeping an eye on everything. A 
pudgy Horror behind a purple-and-green cart was selling ice cream cones 
—black ice cream! 

“Yuck!” Luke declared, making a face. 



We hurried past the cart, past another no pinching sign, and stopped in front 
of what appeared to be a tall purple mountain. 

“It’s a ride!” I told them. 

A doorway was cut into the side of the mountain. 

And above the doorway was a sign: DOOM SLIDE. WILL YOU BE THE 
ONE TO SLIDE FOREVER? 

“Cool!” Luke cried, slapping Clay a high five. 

“Til bet you climb to the top, then slide all the way down,” I said, pointing 
to the top of the mountain-shaped building. 

“Let’s go!” Luke cried excitedly. 

We ran to the building, then through the open doorway in its side. It was 
dark and cold inside. A wide ramp curved up toward the top. 

I could hear kids squealing and laughing, but I couldn’t see them. The three 
of us half walked, half ran up the ramp, eager to get to the top. 

About halfway up, we stopped to read another sign: WARNING! YOU 
MAY BE THE ONE TO SLIDE TO YOUR DOOM! 

Now I could hear kids screaming as they slid down. But it was too dark to 
see anything. “Are you scared, Clay?” I asked, noticing his tight expression. 

“No way!” he insisted, embarrassed by my question. “I’ve seen these things 
before. They’re like really huge sliding boards. You just sit on them and slide 
down.” 

“Hurry!” Luke shouted, running ahead of us. 

“Hey—wait up!” I called. I followed them to the top of the ramp. We found 
ourselves on a wide platform. A row of long, curving sliding boards stretched to 
the end of the platform. The sliding boards were numbered from one to ten. 

In the dim light, I saw two Horrors watching us approach. They stood in 
front of the sliding boards. Their bulging yellow eyes lit up as we hurried over to 
them. 

“Do you slide all the way down?” Luke asked one of them. 

The Horror nodded. 

“Do you go really fast?” Clay asked, lingering a few feet behind us. 

The Horror nodded again. “It’s a long way down,” he rumbled. 

“Be careful which slide you pick,” the other Horror warned. “Don’t pick the 
Doom Slide.” He gestured to the number painted in black in front of each slide. 

“Yes. Don’t pick the Doom Slide,” his partner repeated. “You’ll slide down 
forever and ever.” 



I laughed. 

He was just trying to scare us— wasn’t he?

I chose slide number three because three is my lucky number. Luke sat down on 
top of the slide next to mine, slide number two. And Clay scrambled over to the 
far end and dropped down onto slide number ten. 

I glanced back to see what the Horrors were doing. But before I could focus 
on them, I felt the bottom tilt underneath me. 

I let out a long, high-pitched shriek as I began to slide. 

I raised my arms over my head, leaned back, and screamed all the way 
down. My cries echoed in the enormous dark canyon of the Doom Slide 
building. 

It felt great. The slide curved and curved, and I swirled down in the 
darkness, faster and faster. 

In the shadowy light, I could see Luke in the slide next to mine. He was 
lying on his back, staring straight up with his mouth wide open. 

I tried to call out to him. But the slide curved away, and I curved with it. 

Down, down. 

I was sliding so fast, the darkness became a solid blur. 

The slide curved up, then around, then down again. I’m a human roller 
coaster, I thought happily. 

Down, down. Darker and darker. 

I’m sliding faster than the speed of light, I thought. 

I glanced from one side to the other, trying to see Luke and Clay. But it was 
too dark, and I was moving too fast. 

Too fast. 

And then, bump. 

A chute opened up. I hit the ground hard, landing on the seat of my jeans. 

Outside. I was back outside. 

Bump. 

Luke bounced out beside me. He hit the ground, still lying on his back, and 
made no attempt to get up. He grinned up at me. “Where am I?” 

“Back on the ground,” I told him, climbing to my feet. I brushed off the 
back of my jeans, then reached behind my head to straighten my braid. “Great 
ride, huh?” 



“Let’s go again,” Luke said, still lying there. 

“We can’t go again if you don’t get up,” I said. 

“Help me.” He reached up a hand. 

I groaned as I tugged him to a sitting position. “Get up yourself,” I said 
impatiently. 

“You were screaming in there,” he told me. 

“I did it on purpose,” I said. “I wanted to scream.” 

“Yeah. Sure.” He rolled his eyes. Then he pulled himself to his feet. “Wow. 
I’m a little dizzy. How fast do you think we were going?” 

I shrugged. “Pretty fast, I think. It’s so dark in there, it’s hard to know how 
fast you’re going.” 

And then I realized we were missing a member of our sliding party. I stared 
at the closed chutes on the wall of the building. “Hey—where’s Clay?” 

“Huh?” Luke had forgotten about him, too. 

We both stared at the side of the building, waiting for Clay to pop out. 

“Where is he?” Luke demanded shrilly. “He couldn’t be that much slower 
than us—could he?” 

I shook my head. I was starting to feel really nervous. I had a heavy feeling 
in the pit of my stomach. And my hands were suddenly cold and clammy. 

“Come on, Clay,” I pleaded, staring at the wall. “Come on out.” 

Luke scratched his black hair. “Where’d he go?” he asked. “Why didn’t 
Clay come out?” 

“Maybe he came out the front,” I said. “Maybe slide number ten dumps you 
out in front. Let’s check it out.” 

As we ran around the building toward the front, I scolded myself for getting 
scared so easily. Of course Clay came out in a different chute. He was probably 
waiting for us in front of the building. He was probably worried about us. 

As we rounded the purple building, the wide, circular plaza came into view. 
I searched for Mom and Dad, but they weren’t there. I saw a couple of other 
families on the other side of the circle, and the pudgy green Horror leaning on 
his ice cream cart. 

No sign of Clay. 

Luke and I kept running, up to the front entrance of the Doom Slide. We 
stopped a few feet from the dark opening. 

“He isn’t here!” Luke cried, struggling to catch his breath. 

I was breathing hard, too. And the heavy feeling of dread in my stomach 



grew even heavier. “No. No Clay,” I muttered. 

“What are we going to do?” Luke asked. His blue eyes were wide with fear. 

I saw a green Horror woman standing just inside the entrance. “Hey!” I 
called as I ran over to her. “Did you see a kid come out of there?” I asked 
breathlessly. 

The yellow eyes on the Horror’s mask bulged and appeared to light up. 
“No. This is the entrance. No one comes out here,” she replied. 

“He’s blond and sort of chubby. He wears glasses,” I told her. “He’s 
wearing a blue T-shirt and denim shorts.” 

The Horror shook her head. “No. No one comes out this way. Did you 
check the back? Everyone comes out the back.” 

“He didn’t!” Luke said shrilly. “We were there. He didn’t come out.” My 
brother’s voice was high and squeaky. He was breathing so hard, his chest was 
heaving up and down. He was in a panic. 

I was frightened, too. But I knew I had to stay calm. For Luke’s sake. 

“He didn’t come out the back,” I told the Horror, “and he didn’t come out 
the front. So what happened to him?” 

The Horror was silent for a long moment. Then she said in a low voice just 
above a whisper, “Maybe your friend chose the Doom Slide.”

I stared at the woman in the Horror costume. “You—you’re joking, right?” I 
stammered. “I mean, the Doom Slide—that’s just a joke.” 

She stared back with her bulging yellow eyes and didn’t reply. “The signs 
give a warning,” she said. “There’s always a warning.” 

She turned and disappeared into the dark entrance. Luke and I goggled at 
each other. I swallowed hard. My throat suddenly felt very dry. My hands were 
cold as ice now. 

“This is stupid,” Luke muttered. He jammed his hands into his jeans 
pockets. “It’s just a dumb slide. Why is she trying to scare us?” 

“I guess that’s her job,” I told him. 

“We’ve got to find Mom and Dad,” Luke muttered. 

“We’ve got to find Clay first,” I told him. “If Mom and Dad find out we lost 
Clay, they’ll get angry and make us go home as soon as we find him.” 

“If we find him,” Luke said glumly. 

I glanced back across the plaza. No Mom and Dad. Two teenagers were 
buying black ice cream cones from the Horror at the cart. Two Horrors were 
sweeping the plaza with push brooms, working side by side. 

Far in the distance, I could hear the howl of a wolf from the Werewolf 
Village. 

The sun was high in the sky now. I could feel it beaming down on top of my 
head and on my shoulders. But I still felt cold all over. 

“Clay—where are you?” I asked, thinking out loud. 

“He’s sliding forever,” Luke said, shaking his head. “Sliding forever and 
ever on the Doom Slide.” 

“That’s dumb,” I replied. But Luke had given me an idea. “Come on,” I 
said, tugging the sleeve on his T-shirt. I started pulling him to the dark entrance. 

“Huh? Where?” Luke pulled back. 

“We’ll go on the slides again,” I told him. 

His mouth dropped open in protest. “Without Clay? We can’t go on it again 
without Clay.” 

“We’re going to find Clay,” I said, grabbing his arm this time and pulling 
him to the dark open doorway. 



“You mean—?” My brother was starting to catch on. 

I nodded. “Yes. We’ll follow him. We’ll take the same slide he took.” 

“Slide number ten,” Luke murmured. And then he added in a solemn 
whisper, “The Doom Slide.” 

“We’ll take it, and it will lead us right to him,” I said. 

We climbed the ramp in silence. The rapid thud of our sneakers echoed in 
the vast hollow mountain. 

We ran past the sign about halfway up to the top. I read it again as I passed 
it by: WARNING! YOU MAY BE THE ONE TO SLIDE TO YOUR DOOM! 

Clay—are you still sliding? I wondered. 

I shook my head hard, shaking away the thought. Of course he wasn’t still 
sliding. What a stupid idea! 

The two Horrors were still standing at the top of the slides. “Be careful 
which slide you pick,” one of them warned. 

“We know which one we want,” I said breathlessly. “Slide number ten. 
Both of us. Together.” 

The Horror nearest the slide motioned for us to sit down. I glanced at Luke, 
who stood right behind me, his features tight with fear. 

He tugged me back a few steps. “Maybe we shouldn’t,” he whispered. 

“Why not?” I demanded impatiently. 

“What if the warning is true ? ” Luke demanded. 

“Don’t be dumb,” I scolded him. “This is an amusement park—remember? 
They don’t kill kids or send them sliding to their doom. It’s all for fun!” 

Luke swallowed hard. “You sure?” 

“Of course I’m sure,” I replied. “Now, do you want to find Clay or not?” 

Luke nodded. 

“Then let’s go,” I ordered. 

I sat down at the top of slide number ten. Luke plopped down right behind 
me, stretching his legs outside of mine. 

I felt the floor tilt up beneath us. 

We started to slide. 

“Clay, here we come!” I cried. 



7 


I didn’t scream this time. I clasped my hands in my lap and gritted my teeth. 

There was no way I was going to enjoy this ride. I just wanted to get to the 
end of it. I wanted to solve the mystery and find Clay. 

As we slid down together, Luke grabbed onto me, his hands gripping my 
waist. He cried out when we slid over a big bump, and it felt as if we were going 
to go flying off the slide. 

Then we both screamed as the slide took a steep dive—almost straight 
down—and we started to fall. 

We landed hard, and then the slide curved sharply to the right. We were 
both screaming our lungs out now. 

We were sliding faster and faster, in total darkness, blacker than black. I 
tried to see if we were moving alongside the other slides. But it was so dark, I 
couldn’t even see my sneakers in front of me! 

Luke squeezed my waist so hard, I could hardly breathe. I tried to tell him 
to loosen his grip, but he was screaming too loud to hear. 

Down, down. 

Darker and darker. 

We hit another bump that sent us bouncing up into the air. Then the slide 
dipped and curved sharply to the left. 

We should be at the bottom by now, I realized. 

We’d been sliding a very long time. 

I gritted my teeth harder and tried to brace myself to go flying out the chute 
and bumping onto the ground. 

But no chute opened. 

The ride didn’t end. 

We began to slide faster. I gasped in mouthfuls of the hot, damp air, 
struggling to catch my breath. 

The slide dipped and curved, sending us down into the thick, heavy 
blackness. 

We’re going to slide forever. 

The warning sign didn’t lie. 

I struggled to force those frightening thoughts from my mind. 



Luke suddenly got very quiet. “Are you okay?” I called back to him. 

“I don’t know,” he replied, holding on even tighter. “Why are we sliding so 
long?” 

“You’re hurting me!” I cried. 

He loosened his hold a little. “I don’t like this!” he shouted in my ear. 

We hit another bump. His hands flew off me. 

Another bump. Even harder. I thought I was going to fly off the slide and 
fall to the bottom—if there was a bottom. 

Down, down. 

Luke and I both cried out in disgust as something sticky covered our faces. 
I reached up with both hands and tried to pull it off. 

“Yuck!” Luke screamed. “What is it? My face—!” 

“It’s like cobwebs,” I shouted back at him. “Hot, sticky cobwebs.” 

My whole face itched. The sticky threads covered my face like a net. I 
pulled frantically at them. 

“Oh!” I cried out as the slide took another sharp dip. 

Tearing at the sticky cobwebs, I managed to pull most of them off. But my 
face still itched like crazy. It felt as if a thousand ants were crawling around on 
it. 

“It’s so gross!” Luke yelled behind me. “My face—it hurts!” 

Down, down into the heavy darkness. 

And then a flare of bright light made me shut my eyes. 

Was it daylight? Were we heading outside? 

No. 

I forced my eyes open and squinted at the yellow light. 

And realized I was staring at blazing flames. 

The slide ahead of us was on fire! 

The yellow-and-orange flames raged up, topped by a curtain of billowing 
black smoke. 

I raised my hands to my face and started to shriek. 

We were sliding right into the blazing flames. 

“We’re going to burn up!” Luke screamed. “Help—somebody! Help us!” 



8 


I shut my eyes and felt a powerful burst of heat, almost like an explosion. 

I’m burning up! I thought. 

Burning up! 

A whoosh of cool air made me open my eyes. 

The fire was behind us now. We had sailed right through it. 

Curving gently, we slid through cool darkness. I could still see the orange 
flicker of flames reflected on the dark walls above us. 

Luke and I were both silent. I was waiting for my heart to stop thudding in 
my chest. 

“Great special effects!” Luke cried. He let out a wild laugh, a frantic laugh 
I’d never heard before. 

The fire was fake, I realized. Some kind of projection or something. 

I sucked in mouthfuls of the cool air. I had never been so terrified in my 

life. 

“When does this ride end?” Luke cried. His voice had become high and 
frightened. 

Never, I thought glumly. We really are going to slide forever. 

And as that frightening thought lingered in my mind, a chute opened in 
front of us. Daylight streamed in. 

Bump. 

I landed hard on soft grass. 

A second later, Luke dropped out behind me. 

I blinked several times, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the bright sunlight. 

Then I climbed slowly to my feet, my heart still pounding. 

A yellow-and-green sign on a wooden pole stood directly in front of us. It 
read: WELCOME TO DOOM, POPULATION: 0 HUMANS. 

Standing next to the sign was Clay. He came rushing over to greet us, a 
happy smile on his round, pink face. “Hey, guys—hey!” he called. “Where’ve 
you been?” He slapped Luke a high five. Then Luke gave him a playful punch in 
the stomach. 

“Where’ve we been?” I asked. “Where’ve you been?” 



“Right here,” Clay replied. “I didn’t know where I was. I think this is the 
other side of the park or something. So I just waited for you.” 

“We went back on the Doom Slide,” Luke explained. “We took your slide. 
Number ten. What a ride! It was so cool!” 

A few seconds ago, Luke had been shrieking in real terror. Now here he 
was, pretending he loved it, telling Clay how cool it was. 

“You picked the good slide!” Luke told Clay. “Wow! It was excellent!” 

“I was kind of scared,” Clay confessed. “I mean, the fire—” 

“Great special effects!” my brother exclaimed. “This park is awesome!” 

Luke was such a phony. There was no way he would ever admit that he had 
been worried about Clay. And no way he’d admit that the long slide to Doom 
had terrified him. 

But I was glad to see his old enthusiasm return. I really didn’t like seeing 
my brother frightened and in a panic. 

“It was kind of a long slide,” Clay said, frowning. His feathery blond hair 
glowed in the bright sunlight. “A little too long, I think.” 

“I’d like to go on it again!” Luke boasted. 

I turned and gazed around. We were definitely in another section of 
HorrorLand. Nothing looked familiar. 

Across the wide walkway, I saw several kids in bathing suits heading down 
a sandy path. A sign over the path read: HORROR RAPIDS. 

To our right, a square-shaped building made of glass reflected the bright 
sunlight. The glass walls shimmered brightly as if on fire. Squinting into the 
light, I could just barely make out the sign in front of it: HOUSE OF MIRRORS. 

“Let’s try the House of Mirrors!” Luke urged, pulling Clay by the arm. 

“Whoa! Wait a minute!” I cried. “Don’t you think we should try to find 
Mom and Dad?” 

“They’re way over on the other side of the park,” Luke replied, tugging 
Clay along with him across the pavement. “Let’s have some fun and then find 
them.” 

“They’re probably looking for us,” I said fretfully. 

“The park isn’t very crowded. They’ll find us,” Luke replied. “Come on, 
Lizzy—it looks like fun!” 

I hesitated, thinking about Mom and Dad. I stared into the white glare of the 
glass building. 

Suddenly, I felt someone tap my shoulder. 



Startled, I cried out and spun around. 

It was a green-costumed Horror. His bulging eyes stared into mine as he 
leaned close to me. “Get away while you can!” he whispered. 

He turned his eyes quickly from side to side, as if making sure no one was 
watching him. “Please — I’m serious! Get away while you can!” 



9 


I was so stunned, I didn’t say anything. I watched him run off, moving 
awkwardly in the bulky Horror costume, his purple tail dragging over the 
pavement behind him. 

“What did he want?” Clay called. He and Luke were nearly up to the House 
of Mirrors entrance. 

“He—he said we should get out while we can,” I stammered, running over 
to them. I lost them for a moment in the blinding sunlight reflected off the glass 
building. 

Luke laughed. “These Horror guys are great!” he declared. “They really try 
to scare you in this place!” 

Behind his glasses, Clay’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “He was kidding— 
right?” he asked quietly. “I mean, it was just a joke, wasn’t it?” 

“I don’t know,” I told him. “I guess so.” I watched the Horror disappear 
quickly behind a tall, blue, pyramid-shaped building. 

“That’s his job,” Luke insisted. “He goes around scaring people all day.” 

“Maybe he was really warning us,” Clay murmured, staring at me. 

“No way!” Luke declared. He gave Clay a hard slap on the back. “Stop 
looking so gloomy all the time. This is a great place! You like to be scared, don’t 
you?” 

Clay’s expression remained worried. “I guess,” he replied uncertainly. 

I started to tell Clay I was sure it was just a joke, but Luke interrupted. 
“Hurry up! Let’s check out the House of Mirrors. Let’s have some fun before 
Mom and Dad show up and make us leave.” 

He dragged Clay toward the entrance, and I followed. We passed another no 
pinching sign as we made our way to the shimmering glass building. 

Outside the entrance, I stopped to read the yellow-and-green sign. It read: 
HOUSE OF MIRRORS. REFLECT BEFORE YOU ENTER. NO ONE MAY 
EVER SEE YOU AGAIN! 

“Hey—wait up!” I called to the boys. They had already hurried inside. 

I stepped in and found myself in a narrow, dark tunnel. My eyes were still 
filled with the bright glare from outside. I couldn’t see a thing. 

“Luke, Clay—wait up!” I shouted. My voice echoed through the low 



tunnel. I could hear them laughing up ahead. 

I jogged blindly, ducking my head because the ceiling was so low. Finally, 
my eyes adjusted to the darkness. 

The tunnel ended, and I found myself in a narrow corridor with mirrored 
walls and a mirrored ceiling. 

“Oh!” I uttered a low cry. I could see my reflections—dozens of them. I 
seemed to surround myself! 

I stopped for a moment and adjusted my long black braid. It was always 
coming loose. Then I called again to the boys, “Where are you? Wait up!” 

I could hear them giggling somewhere up ahead. “Try and find us!” Luke 
called. More giggling. 

I made my way quickly through the mirrored walkway. The walls curved to 
the right, then the left. My reflections followed me, stretching deep into the 
mirrors, dozens and dozens of me, getting smaller and smaller, stretching to 
infinity! 

“Hey—don’t get too far ahead!” I cried. 

I heard them giggling. Then I heard a rumble of footsteps that seemed to 
come from the other side of the mirrored wall. 

I followed the corridor, walking slowly, carefully, until I saw a narrow 
opening up ahead. 

“Wait right there. I’m coming through!” I called. 

I started through the opening and— BONK !—hit my forehead on solid 
glass. 

“Ow!” I cried out as the pain jolted across my forehead, then down the back 
of my neck, all the way down my spine. 

I raised my hands to the glass and waited for my dizziness to fade away. 

“Lizzy, where are you? Try to find us!” I heard Luke call. 

“I hit my head!” I shouted, rubbing my forehead. 

I could hear him and Clay laughing. Their voices seemed to be behind me 
now. I turned back, but there were only mirrors behind me. No opening. 

My head still ached a little, but the dizziness had gone away. I started 
walking again, more carefully this time. I kept both hands out in front of me so I 
wouldn’t bump into anything again. 

I turned a corner and stepped into a different room. To my surprise, the 
floor in this room was a mirror. The walls, the ceiling, the floor—were all 
mirrors. I felt as if I were standing inside a mirrored box. 



I took a few careful steps. It felt so weird walking on my own reflection. 

I could see the tops and the bottoms of my sneakers as I walked. It made it 
really hard to walk. I kept having the feeling that I was going to fall into myself! 

“Hey, guys—where are you?” I called. 

No reply. 

I felt a sharp stab of fear in my stomach. 

“Luke? Clay? Are you there?” I saw the mouths of my reflections move as I 
called out, dozens of mouths. But only one voice came out, my voice, tiny and 
shrill. 

“Luke? Clay?” 

Silence. 

“Don’t fool around, guys!” I shouted. “Where are you?” 

Silence. No reply. 

I stared at the dozens of reflections on all sides of me. They all looked very 
frightened. 

“Luke? Clay?” 

Where had they gone? 



10 


I stared at my reflections as horrifying thoughts swept over me. 

Had the hoys really disappeared? 

Had they fallen into some kind of trap? Were they lost in the maze of glass 
and mirrors ? 

HorrorLand was too scary, I decided. It was fun to be scared. But it was too 
hard to tell whether the scares here were for fun—or for real. Were there dangers 
in this place? Or was it all a big scary joke? 

“Luke? Clay?” I called to them in a trembling voice, turning all around, 
searching for an exit. 

Silence. 

Then I heard a muffled giggle. 

Then I heard whispering voices. Nearby. 

Another giggle, louder this time. Luke’s giggle. 

They had been playing a little joke on me. “Hey, you’re not funny!” I 
screamed angrily. “Really! Not funny!” 

I could hear them both burst out laughing. “Come and find us, Lizzy!” Luke 
called. 

“What’s taking you so long?” Clay added. 

More giggling. It seemed to come from just up ahead. 

Sliding my hands along the mirrors, I followed the hallway around to the 
right. I had to duck my head to slip through a narrow opening between the 
mirrors. 

I found myself in another small room surrounded by mirrors above and 
below and on all sides. The mirrors were tilted at strange angles so that my 
reflections appeared to bounce off each other as I moved. 

“Where are you? Am I getting closer?” I called. 

The light grew dim as I made my way through this room. My reflections 
darkened. The shadows grew longer. 

“We can’t see you!” Clay called. 

“Hurry up!” Luke shouted impatiently. 

“I’m going as fast as I can!” I screamed. “Just don’t move, okay? Stay in 
one place.” 



“We are! ” Luke called back. 

“How will we ever get out of here?” I heard Clay ask him in a low voice. 

“Ow!” I bumped my head again on a section of clear glass. 

I pounded my fist angrily on the glass. 

This wasn’t any fun, I decided. It was too painful. 

“Hurry up!” Luke called from somewhere nearby. “It’s boring waiting here 
for you!” 

“I’m coming,” I muttered, rubbing my poor aching forehead. 

I turned a corner and stepped into a wider room. No mirrors here. The walls 
were all glass. I stopped to gaze around—and there was Luke. 

“Finally!” he cried. “Why couldn’t you find us?” 

“I kept hitting my head,” I told him. “Let’s get out of here. Where’s Clay?” 

“Huh?” Luke’s mouth dropped open in surprise. He spun around, searching 
for his friend. “He was standing right here,” he said. 

“Luke—I’m in no mood for any more dumb jokes,” I said sharply. “Clay, 
where are you hiding?” 

“I’m not hiding. I’m over here,” Clay called. 

I took a few steps closer to my brother, and Clay came into view. He was 
standing in deep shadows behind a glass wall, his hands pressed against the 
pane. 

“How’d you get over there?” Luke asked Clay. 

Clay shrugged. “I can’t find a way out.” 

I moved toward my brother, then stopped. I suddenly realized that he was 
behind a wall of glass. Luke and I were in different rooms. 

“Hey—where’s the opening?” I asked him. 

Luke glanced around. “What do you mean, Lizzy?” 

“You and I—we’re not in the same room,” I replied. I walked up to the 
glass wall and tapped on it with my fist. 

“Huh?” Luke’s face filled with surprise. He made his way over to me. Then 
he tapped on his side of the glass, as if making sure it really did exist. 

“How’d that get there?” he murmured. 

Clay started moving around his room, sliding his hands along the panes of 
glass, searching for the opening. 

“Stand right there,” I told Luke. “I’ll find a way into your room.” 

I followed Clay’s example. I moved slowly around the room, keeping a 
hand pressed against the glass. The light was dim. My shadow fell over the glass 



as I walked. I could see my face reflected darkly in the glass. My eyes stared 
back at me, dark and desperate. 

Before I realized it, I had made a complete circle. 

I was back where I had started. And there was no opening. No doorway. 

No way out. 

“Hey! I’m trapped in here!” Clay called shrilly. 

“So am I,” I told him. 

“There’s got to be an opening,” Luke said. “How did we get in?” 

“You’re right,” I replied fretfully. “We should be able to get out the way we 
came in.” I began to search along the walls again, moving quickly. 

My heart began to pound. I had a fluttering feeling in my chest. There had 
to be a way out. There had to be. 

Luke pounded hard on the glass. In the other room, I could see Clay jogging 
frantically around his room, pushing on the walls as he moved. 

I went all the way around twice, then stopped. 

There was no way out. 

“I—I’m trapped,” I stammered. “It’s like a box. A glass box.” 

“We’re all trapped!” Clay cried. 

Luke was still pounding frantically on the glass with his fists. “Luke— 
stop!” I cried shrilly. “That isn’t helping!” 

He lowered his fists to his sides. “This is ridiculous,” he muttered. “There’s 
got to be a way out.” 

“Maybe there’s a trapdoor or something,” I suggested. I began to search the 
mirrored floor. It was too dark to see well. The floor appeared solid to me. 

I returned to the glass wall. “This isn’t much fun,” I said glumly. 

Luke and Clay nodded. I could see they were both really frightened. So was 
I. But I decided I was two years older than them, so I had to try to be the brave 
one. 

I wasn’t feeling very brave, though. Uttering a worried sigh, I leaned 
against the wall that separated Luke and me. 

And as I leaned, the wall started to move. 

I jumped back with a sharp cry. 

The wall was sliding toward me, closing in on me. 

I took another step back. 

Glancing around frantically, I saw that all the walls were sliding in. 

“Luke!” I cried. I turned to see him backing up, too. 



“The walls!” Clay called. “Help me!” 

“They’re sliding in on me, too!” Luke screamed. “Each room must have its 
own glass walls!” 

All three of us were trapped. 

With a desperate groan, I threw myself against one of the walls and tried to 
push it back. 

But I couldn’t stop it. 

The box was closing in, growing smaller. Smaller. 

“We’re going to be crushed!” I cried. 



11 


“Do something! Please—do something!” Clay was screaming. 

Luke lowered his shoulder to the glass and struggled to stop it from 
moving. But he wasn’t strong enough. The walls kept sliding in on him. 

I backed up, my hands raised like a shield. 

Closer, closer. The glass walls moved slowly, silently. 

I backed up until my back hit the wall behind me. 

There was nowhere to go. 

“Do something! Somebody —do something!” Clay’s terrified screams rang 
in my ears. 

“The glass—it’s squeezing me!” Luke shrieked. “Lizzy!” 

“I—I can’t move!” I shouted to him. 

The panes of glass began to press in on me from all sides. Above and 
below, too. 

I suddenly pictured one of those crushed cars. 

You know. The ears that are crunched into a perfect square in those big 
compactor machines. 

My entire body shuddered as I realized I was going to be crushed into a 
perfect square, too. 

“Ow!” I cried out as the glass pressed down on me. “Somebody—help!” I 
tried to scream, but my voice came out a muffled yelp. 

It was getting hard to breathe. 

The glass panes moved in. Tighter. Tighter. 

I gasped for air. 

I tried to push with all my might against the glass. 

But it was no use. 

I was being crushed into a human square. 



12 


I couldn’t hear Luke or Clay anymore. 

I could only hear my gasping, choked breath. 

I shut my eyes. 

And felt the floor drop away. 

And before I realized what was happening, I was falling, falling rapidly 
down. 

I opened my eyes in time to see the glass walls roll above me as I slid 
down, down, down through an open chute. 

And in a few seconds, I was back outside. I landed sitting up on the grass 
with a gentle thud. 

Luke and Clay came sliding out beside me. 

For a long moment, we sat on the grass, blinking in the bright sunlight, 
staring at each other in disbelief. 

“We’re okay,” Clay said uncertainly, finally breaking the silence. He slowly 
climbed to his feet. His round face was bright red, and his glasses were crooked 
and nearly falling off his nose. “We’re okay!” 

Luke let out a laugh. A gleeful laugh. He stood up and began jumping up 
and down for joy. 

I didn’t exactly feel like jumping up and down. I was still picturing the 
crushed car. 

Luke reached down, grabbed both of my hands, and pulled me to my feet. 
“What should we do next?” he demanded, grinning. 

“Huh? Next?” I cried. “Are you for real?” 

“That was really scary,” Clay said, his face still red. “I thought we were 
going to be scrunched flat.” 

“It was awesome!” Luke declared. 

Once again, he was forgetting that a few seconds before, he’d been 
screaming in total panic. 

“It was way too scary,” Clay murmured, shaking his head. 

“Clay’s right,” I agreed. “It was too scary to be fun. One more second, 
and...” 

“Don’t you see? That’s the whole idea!” Luke cried. “That’s how they scare 



you here. It’s so awesome! They make you think that one more second and 
you’re a goner. But it’s all perfectly timed. They want you to be terrified—and 
then— poof —you’re okay!” 

“I guess you’re right,” said Clay doubtfully. He pushed up his glasses, then 
mbbed his chin. 

“We’re not really going to get hurt or anything,” Luke continued. “This is 
an amusement park, remember? They want you to come back again and again. 
So they’re not going to really hurt anybody.” 

“Maybe,” Clay said. 

“But, Luke, what if they mess up?” I asked him. “What if the machines get 
goofed up? What if the timing gets off? Let’s say the floor underneath us got 
stuck. Then what?” 

Luke didn’t reply. He stared back at me thoughtfully. 

“What would have happened to us if the floor hadn’t dropped away at the 
right moment?” I demanded. 

Luke shrugged. “They make sure everything works okay,” he answered 
finally. 

I rolled my eyes. “Yeah. Sure.” 

“Is it possible to really be scared to death?” Clay asked me, a solemn 
expression on his face. “I mean, I know it happens in books and movies. But 
does it happen in real life?” 

“I don’t know. Maybe,” I replied. 

“I’ll bet people could get scared to death in that House of Mirrors,” Clay 
continued seriously. 

“No way!” Luke insisted. “Listen to me. This is just a place for fun. Scary 

fun.” 

He was watching something over my shoulder. I turned to see one of the 
guys in a green Horror costume walking by, carrying a huge bouquet of black 
balloons. 

Luke hurried up beside the Horror. “Hey, has anyone ever died here in this 
park?” Luke asked. 

The Horror kept walking. The black balloons bobbed above his head. “Only 
once,” he told Luke. 

“One person died here?” Luke asked. 

The Horror shook his big green head. “No. Not what I meant.” 

“What did you mean?” Luke demanded. 



“A person can only die once here,” the Horror said. “No one has ever died 
twice.” 



13 


“Do you mean people have really died here?” I shouted. 

But the Horror walked quickly on, the black balloons bouncing against each 
other, floating darkly against the clear blue sky. 

The Horror’s answer made me shiver. It wasn’t just his words. It was the 
cold tone of his voice, the way he made it sound like a warning. 

“He was joking—right?” Clay asked in a trembling voice. He scratched his 
blond hair nervously. 

“Yeah. I guess,” I replied. 

A family walked past us, heading toward the House of Mirrors. They had 
two little boys with them, both about five or six, and both of them were crying. 

“I’ve seen so many crying kids in this park!” I commented. 

“They’re just wimps,” Luke replied. “Scaredy-cats. Let’s go find another 
ride or something.” 

“No, I really think we should find Mom and Dad,” I told him. 

“Yeah. Let’s go find them,” Clay said eagerly. The poor kid. I think he was 
really scared. But he was trying his best not to let my brother see how frightened 
he was. 

“Aw, what’s the hurry?” Luke protested. “Let them find us. ” 

“But they’re probably really worried,” I insisted. I started walking toward 
the front gate. 

“Dad will only make us leave,” Luke grumbled. But he followed anyway. 
And Clay gratefully came along, keeping close to my side. 

Following the trail, we passed by a rickety old wooden roller coaster. It rose 
up as high as a four-story building, casting a wide, dark shadow over the walk. A 
sign in front read: OUT OF ORDER, DO YOU DARE TO RIDE IT ANYWAY? 

The gate was open. There was no attendant. 

“Hey, Lizzy, want to ride it?” Luke asked, staring at the beat-up old cars 
parked at the bottom of the tracks. 

“No way!” Clay and I replied in unison. We kept on walking. 

The trail curved under thick trees, and we were suddenly in the shade. A 
sign read: BEWARE OF TREE SNAKES. 

Clay covered his head with his hands. All three of us raised our eyes to the 



trees. 

Were there really snakes up there? 

It was too dark to see anything. The leaves were so thick, no sunlight 
filtered through. 

Suddenly, I heard a gentle hissing sound. 

At first I thought it was just the rustle of the leaves. 

But then the hissing grew louder—until all of the trees seemed to be hissing 
down at us. 

“Run!” I cried. 

The three of us started running along the trail, ducking low, our sneakers 
thudding hard on the pavement. The hissing in the trees above us grew louder, 
angrier. 

I thought I saw a long, dark snake slithering in the grass beside the trail. But 
it might have just been a shadow. 

We kept running even after the trees ended and we were in sunlight again. 
The trail curved past a row of evil-looking statues. They were made of stone. 
They were statues of grinning monsters, eyes narrowed menacingly, fangs 
lowered from their twisted mouths. Their arms were outstretched, ready to grab 
anyone who came close. 

I slowed to a trot, my eyes on the ugly statues. Suddenly, I heard low, evil 
laughter. 

“It—it’s coming from the statues!” Clay exclaimed. “Keep running!” 

Did the statues move toward us? Did they raise their arms higher? Did they 
beckon to us to come closer? 

I’m not sure. With their evil laughter in my ears, I lowered my head and 
turned on the speed. 

All three of us were panting hard as we ran along the trail. I didn’t see any 
other people. I didn’t see anyone in a Horror costume, either. 

We slowed as we came to another sign. This one had an arrow pointing in 
the direction we were running. It read: FRONT EXIT, DON’T BOTHER, YOU 
WILL NEVER ESCAPE. 

I caught the worried expression on Clay’s face as he read the sign. “It’s only 
a joke,” I told him. “The signs are supposed to be funny.” 

“Ha-ha,” he said weakly. He was panting hard, struggling to catch his 
breath. 

Without warning, Luke jumped on Clay’s shoulders. “Hey, Clay—how 



about a ride?” 

Clay cried out angrily, “Get off!” 

Luke laughed and hung on. Clay dropped to his knees, trying to throw Luke 
off. 

“Come on, guys,” I pleaded. “Luke, stop being such a goof. We’re trying to 
find Mom and Dad.” 

But now they were laughing and wrestling on the ground. 

“Come on, guys!” I shouted, rolling my eyes. “Let’s go!” I tugged my 
brother to his feet. 

Clay’s glasses had flown off. He stopped to pick them up from the grass. 
Then we continued on our way. 

The path led past a rectangular flower garden—filled with black flowers! 
Then it suddenly came to a stop in front of a large red barn. 

The boys walked up to the open doorway of the barn. I stayed back, 
searching for a path that led around the barn. I couldn’t see one. 

“The path goes right through the barn to the other side,” Luke called to me. 
“Come on, Lizzy!” He motioned for me to join them. 

I spotted a small sign painted to the right of the barn’s double doors. It read: 
BAT BARN. 

“Hey—are there bats in there?” I called, feeling a cold shudder run down 
my back. I like most animals. But bats really give me the creeps. 

Luke stepped inside the barn. Clay hung back, standing just outside the 
door. “I don’t see any,” Luke called out to me. “It’s kind of dark.” 

A strange odor invaded my nostrils. It was strong and sour. It came from the 

barn. 

I didn’t want to go in there. 

“Come on, Lizzy!” Luke called. “The path goes right out the other side. 
Don’t be chicken. You can run straight through.” 

I stepped up beside Clay at the doorway and peered inside the barn. 

“It looks okay,” Clay said quietly. 

The sour odor was much stronger. “Yuck,” I said, making a face. “It really 
stinks.” 

Luke stood inside the barn, his eyes raised to the rafters. “I don’t see 
anything up there,” he reported. 

Doors on the opposite wall were wide open. It would only take ten seconds 
to run through the barn and out the other side, I realized. 



“Let’s go,” I told Clay. 

He and I stepped into the barn. The sour smell was overpowering. I held my 
breath and pinched my fingers over my nose. 

We started running to the doors on the opposite wall—and they slammed 

shut. 

With a gasp of surprise, I turned back to the doors we had entered. They 
slammed shut, too. 

“Hey!” I shouted angrily. 

“What’s going on?” Clay cried in a whisper. 

We were in total darkness, blacker than black. 

The sour odor swept over me. I started to feel sick. 

And then I heard the rapid flutter of wings. Soft at first, then louder, closer. 

I screamed as I felt something brush against the back of my neck. 



14 


“Go away!” I let out a low moan of horror and swung my hands wildly above 
my head. 

The rapid fluttering retreated, then returned. 

“Bats!” Clay cried in a terrified, tiny voice. I felt him grab my arm. 

“I can’t see!” Luke shouted. “It’s so dark!” 

“I—I hate bats! ” I stammered. 

I felt a cold whoosh of air as a bat flapped over my head. 

I swung my hands wildly. 

The flapping, fluttering sounds were all around us. 

As my eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness, I began to see shadowy shapes 
shooting past. Back and forth. Faster and faster. 

I felt one brush my shoulder. 

“Oh, help!” I cried. 

Clay started to shriek. “Help us! Help us!” 

“They’re zooming right at me!” Luke wailed. 

Something bumped into my shoulder. I screamed. 

“Help us! Help us!” Clay continued to plead at the top of his lungs. His 
shouts were nearly drowned out by the flapping of wings. 

I felt another bat brush against my shoulder. Covering my face, I tried to 
make my way blindly to the door. 

The sour odor choked me. My terror made my legs shaky. I could barely 
walk. 

And then I felt a hard tug in my hair. 

Another tug. Loud flapping right on my head. 

A shrill whistling hiss. So close, it could have been coming from me. 

I screamed. I screamed again. 

“It—it’s caught in my hair!” I cried, falling to my knees. 

Another shrill hiss. Another tug of my hair. 

I swung my hands. I hit it. I felt a warm body, felt the brush of fluttering 
wings. 

I shoved it hard—shoved it from my hair. 



“Ohhh, help!” I cried. 

The flapping wings and shrill whistles surrounded me. I could hear Luke 
and Clay shouting. But they seemed far, far away. 

Another one brushed my cheek. Another one bumped my shoulder. 

The shadows darted back and forth. The barn was alive with flying, 
chittering bats. 

“Ohh, help! Help us, please!” Another one brushed my face. I felt a rush of 
air, beating wings on the top of my head. “Help us! Help us!” But there was no 
one around to help. 



15 


I covered my eyes with one hand and thrashed out wildly with the other hand, 
trying to beat the bats away. 

Choking and sobbing, I could barely breathe. 

I heard Luke calling far, far away. He seemed to be behind a curtain of 
flapping, chittering bats. 

And then, suddenly, sunlight invaded the barn. 

On my knees, I lowered my hand from my eyes and saw that the barn door 
had slid open. 

Luke, standing at the door, his mouth open in shock, turned back to Clay 
and me. “I—I touched the door, and it opened,” he explained. 

Clay’s glasses were hanging off one ear. His blond hair was totally messed 
up. His eyes darted around the barn. “Where are the bats?” he cried. 

I raised my eyes to the rafters. “Hey!” I cried out. No bats. No sign of any 
bats anywhere. 

I climbed to my feet, pulling my hair back with both hands. “Let’s get out 
of here!” I cried. 

Clay and I followed Luke out of the barn. The warm sunshine felt so good! 

I was still itchy from the bats. I rubbed my shoulders and the back of my 
neck. “I hate bats! I really do!” I exclaimed with a shudder. 

“But there weren’t any bats,” Luke said, grinning at me. “It was all a fake.” 

“Huh? It was not!” Clay cried angrily. “Those were bats. I could hear them 
—and feel them!” 

“All special effects,” Luke claimed. 

“It wasn’t special effects when one got tangled in my hair!” I cried. Just 
thinking about it gave me cold shivers. 

“Special effects,” Luke repeated. “Really excellent special effects. I was 
almost scared, too.” 

“Almost!” I cried. I walked over, grabbed him, and pretended to wring his 
neck. “Almost? I heard you screaming your head off, Luke! ” 

He pulled out of my grasp, laughing. “I knew it wasn’t real. I was just 
screaming like that to scare you!” 

What a liar! I really didn’t believe my brother. He was scared. He was 



plenty scared. I knew he was! 

“They were bats, not special effects,” I insisted angrily. 

“Then where did they go when the door opened?” Luke demanded. “As 
soon as the door opened, the bats all vanished.” 

“Let’s stop talking about it,” Clay pleaded. “Let’s find your parents— 
okay?” 

“Yeah, okay,” I agreed, glaring at Luke. “You really are nuts, you know 
that?” I told him. 

He stuck his tongue out at me. 

I wanted to punch his lights out. But I try to be a nonviolent person. So I 
just gave him one hard punch on the shoulder. 

He howled in protest. “You’re stupid, Lizzy. You’re really stupid,” he 
muttered. “And you’re afraid of pretend bats!” 

I ignored him and led the way down the path toward the front gate. Two 
people in Horror costumes appeared on the path, going the other way, chatting 
enthusiastically. 

“Is this the way to the front gate?” I called to them. 

They ignored my question and walked right past us. 

“Hey!” I called to them. 

But they both kept jabbering away and didn’t even seem to see or hear me. 

The sun beamed down on us. The air had become hot and still, with no 
breeze at all. 

I wiped sweat off my forehead with one hand. I could still smell the sour 
aroma of the Bat Barn. The odor was on my hands, on my clothes. 

I saw four teenagers in bathing suits, two boys and two girls, hurrying over 
the grass toward a large brown pond. A sign came into view near the shore. It 
read: ALLIGATOR POND, FEEL FREE TO SWIM HERE. 

Luke laughed. “Are those guys crazy?” 

We stopped to watch them step into the water. 

“Do you think there are really alligators in there?” Clay asked, biting his 
lower lip. 

I shrugged. “Who knows? I don’t know what to think about this park!” 

We continued along the path. A few minutes later, I recognized the 
mountain-shaped structure of the Doom Slide. The wide, circular plaza came 
into view. It was nearly deserted. Even the ice-cream-selling Horror had 
vanished from his cart. 



“Where do you suppose Mom and Dad are?” I asked. 

“They’ve probably been looking for us for hours, and now they’re really 
mad,” Luke said, frowning. 

“Where are they?” Clay cried. He was starting to sound really stressed out. 
“We’ve got to find them.” 

“Is that them?” Luke asked. He was pointing to a man and a woman in the 
shade of a large stone fountain. 

I shielded my eyes from the sun with one hand. The woman was tall, with 
dark hair. The man was short and blond. 

“Yes! That’s them!” I cried happily. I started running to the fountain, calling 
to them, “Mom! Dad!” 

The boys came racing after me. 

“Mom! Dad! Hey!” I shouted happily. 

They both turned around, surprised expressions on their faces. 

“Oh!” I cried out when I saw it wasn’t them. I stopped short, and Luke 
bumped right into me. 

“Sorry,” I told the confused couple. “We thought you were someone else.” 

The three of us hurried across the plaza. I could hear the wail of wolf howls 
from the Werewolf Village. The ice cream cart stood lonely and deserted near the 
entrance to the Doom Slide. 

“Where are they?” Clay asked, whining. “I’m starting to get hungry.” 

“Yeah. It’s way past lunchtime,” I agreed. 

“They could be anywhere,” Luke said unhappily, kicking a pebble across 
the pavement. “They could be anywhere in this giant park.” 

I sighed. “Let’s look for them in the shade. The sun is really getting hot.” 

We headed toward the shade of the Doom Slide building. Suddenly, two 
green-costumed Horrors came into view. Their big yellow eyes bulged in front of 
their heads. 

Without thinking, I went running up to them. “Have you seen our parents?” 
I asked breathlessly. 

They stared at me in surprise. “Your parents?” one of them repeated. 

“Yeah.” I nodded. “My mom has black hair. My dad is kind of short and he 
has blond hair.” 

“Hmmmm.” The two Horrors glanced at each other. 

“Mom was wearing a bright yellow sundress,” I told them. 

“And Dad had a Chicago Cubs cap on his head,” Luke added. 



“Oh, yeah. Right,” one of the Horrors, a woman, replied. 

“You saw them?” I asked eagerly. 

She nodded. “Yeah. I remember them. They left. They left about half 
hour ago.” 

“Huh?” I gaped at her in disbelief. 

“They asked me to give you a message,” the Horror said. 

“Message? What message?” I asked. 

“Good-bye,” the Horror replied. 



16 


“You’re wrong!” I cried. “They wouldn’t leave.” 

“About half an hour ago,” the Horror repeated. She shrugged her shoulders 
under the bulky monster costume. “I was at the gate when they left.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

The two Horrors turned and began walking toward a small white shed at the 
edge of the plaza. 

“Hey, wait!” I called, chasing after them. “You made a mistake. Our parents 
wouldn’t leave without us.” 

They disappeared into the shed. The door slammed behind them. 

I turned back to Luke and Clay. They stared at me blankly. 

“She was wrong,” I told them. “Mom and Dad are still here. I know it.” 

“Then why did she say—” Clay started, but his voice broke. I could see that 
he was very worried and upset. Beads of sweat ran down his pink forehead. 

Luke tried to make a joke. “I guess that means we have the whole park to 
ourselves!” he exclaimed, forcing a smile. 

“Very funny,” I replied sarcastically. “We also have no money, and we’re 
about three hundred miles from home.” 

“We could call somebody,” Luke suggested. 

“No phones,” Clay muttered. He lowered his head, shoved his hands into 
the pockets of his shorts, and turned away from us. 

“Oh, right,” Luke remembered. “They told Dad there are no phones in the 
park.” 

“That’s crazy,” I said heatedly. “They’re liars. The Horrors are all liars.” 

“I guess that’s their job,” Luke said. “Telling us lies to scare us to death. 
That’s why they call it HorrorLand.” 

“They should call it DumbLand,” Clay muttered bitterly. 

“But it’s so cool!” Luke protested. “I love being scared out of my wits. 
Don’t you?” He gave Clay a hard shove. 

“No,” Clay replied softly. He made no attempt to shove Luke back. 

“Well, she was lying about Mom and Dad,” I insisted, gazing at the white 
shed. “She was just trying to scare us. Mom and Dad are still here. We just have 
to find them.” 



“Come on, let’s go,” Luke urged. “I hope we find them soon. I’m getting 
really hungry.” 

We wandered through the park for what seemed like hours. We searched through 
dark, mysterious woods and strange monster villages. We passed through a 
carnival area with dozens of scary-looking rides. 

On the other side of Vampire Village, we passed a building marked Monster 
Zoo. It was closed. But we could hear the most terrifying grunts, howls, and 
moans coming from inside. 

A long yellow building had a sign outside that proclaimed: GUILLOTINE 
MUSEUM, PLEASE HOLD ON TO YOUR HEAD. Luke wanted to go inside, 
but Clay and I talked him out of it. 

HorrorLand was surprisingly empty. We passed several Horrors scurrying 
along the paths in their bright green costumes. And we saw a few families 
wandering around, always with crying kids. 

The rides in the carnival area were all running empty. All of the food stands 
and restaurants were empty, too. 

We walked clear across to the other end of the park. I was feeling more and 
more worried. 

Why hadn’t we run into Mom and Dad? 

Surely we should have seen them by now. 

Clay had become very quiet. I could tell he was really scared. Even Luke 
trudged along with his shoulders slumped and his head down. 

By the time we found ourselves back at the Alligator Pond, I was feeling 
pretty bad. I crossed the grassy shore and walked up to the edge of the brown 
water. 

“What do you think happened to those teenagers who went swimming 
here?” Luke asked, staring across the pond. “Think the alligators ate them?” 

“Maybe,” I replied. I wasn’t really listening to him. I was thinking about 
Mom and Dad. 

“Hey, look!” Clay cried, pointing to the water. 

I saw two long, greenish-brown logs floating toward us on top of the water. 
It took me a while to realize that the logs were alligators. 

“Big ones!” Clay declared in a hushed whisper. 

“Better step back,” I warned them. 

All three of us were standing at the water’s edge. The alligators floated 



silently just below the surface of the still water, hardly creating a ripple. 

“Mom and Dad didn’t leave without us,” I repeated for the thousandth time. 

“But we searched everywhere,” Luke said quietly. 

“They didn’t leave without us,” I said. “They would never leave without us. 
So...” I hesitated. I was thinking hard, and my thoughts were all frightening. 

“So?” Clay asked eagerly. 

“So if they’re not in the park,” I continued, “it means something happened 
to them. Something bad happened to them.” 

Clay gasped. Luke narrowed his blue eyes at me. “What do you mean, 
Lizzy?” he asked. 

“I mean maybe this place really is evil,” I said. “And maybe the Horrors or 
somebody did something bad to Mom and Dad.” 

I stared down at the brown alligator backs gliding so smoothly, so 
effortlessly toward us. 

“That’s crazy,” Luke muttered. 

I knew it was crazy. But I had no other explanation. 

“I have such a bad feeling about this park,” I told them. “A real bad 
feeling.” 

And as I said that, I felt strong hands grab me from behind and push me 
into the Alligator Pond. 



17 


I screamed. 

Then I realized I wasn’t being tossed into the water. 

The hands were holding on to my shoulders. 

I spun around. “Dad!” I cried. 

“Lizzy!” he exclaimed, still holding on to me. “Where have you guys 
been?” 

“We’ve searched this entire park twelve times!” Mom declared. She was 
standing behind us on the grass, hands pressed tensely on her waist. 

“We were looking for you!” I cried. 

“They told us you left!” Luke said. 

“We were kind of scared,” Clay added. 

We all started talking at once. I was so happy to see them. And I could see 
that Luke and Clay were really happy, too. 

I had imagined all sorts of terrible things happening to Mom and Dad. It 
wasn’t like me to let my imagination run away like that. 

But HorrorLand was such a scary place. It was impossible not to have scary 
thoughts here. 

“I want to go home,” I said. 

“Did you find a phone?” Clay asked. “Did you find a car?” 

Dad shook his head. “No. No phones. The guy in the monster costume 
didn’t lie. There are no phones in the park.” 

“But the Horrors were very nice to us,” Mom broke in. “They told us not to 
worry about a thing.” 

“They said to just come to the ticket booth when we were ready to leave,” 
Dad reported. 

Mom ran a hand tenderly through Luke’s hair. “Did you go on any rides or 
anything?” 

“We did a lot of scary stuff,” Luke told her. 

“Very scary,” Clay added. 

“I’m really hungry,” Luke said. 

Dad glanced at his watch. “It’s way past lunchtime. I think we’re all 



hungry.” 

“The restaurants and foodstands are all on the other side of the park,” Mom 

said. 

“Can we just eat lunch and then leave?” I asked eagerly. I still had a bad 
feeling about the place. I wanted to get away from HorrorLand, far away. 

“Your mom and I have spent all our time searching for you,” Dad said, 
wiping sweat off his sunburned forehead with one hand. “We haven’t had any 
fun at all.” 

“We should all at least go on one ride together before we leave,” Mom said. 

“I just want to go,” I urged. “I really do.” 

“Lizzy, that’s not like you,” Mom scolded. 

“She’s scared,” Luke told them. “She’s a chicken.” 

“Maybe there’s a ride that will take us to the front of the park,” Dad 
suggested. “We could all take it, then have some lunch and leave.” 

“That sounds good,” Mom said. She stared at me. “Okay with you?” 

“I guess,” I told her, sighing. “It’s just that the rides here are all too scary. 
They aren’t any fun.” 

Luke laughed. “They’re too scary for Lizzy—but not for Clay and me,” he 
said. “Right, Clay?” 

“I was a little scared in the Bat Barn,” Clay confessed. 

We headed away from the Alligator Pond, across the grassy shore to the 
paved walkway. A couple of costumed Horrors walked past, chattering in low 
voices. 

A girl’s high-pitched shrieks of terror floated in the air from somewhere in 
the distance. The same frightening cry repeated over and over. 

Wolf howls rose up in front of us. And from a speaker hidden somewhere in 
the trees, I heard evil laughter, a hideous cackle that repeated over and over. 

“It’s like being in a horror movie,” Mom commented. 

“Very clever,” Dad added, walking with a hand on my shoulder. “It’s 
strange that we never heard of this park.” 

“They should put some ads on TV,” Mom said. “Then they’d get more 
people to come here.” 

We passed by a tall, narrow green building with a sign in front that read: 
FREE FALL, THE ONLY BUNGEE JUMP WITHOUT A CORD. 

“Want to try that?” Dad asked, squeezing my shoulder and grinning at me. 

“I don’t think so,” I quickly replied. 



Luke was way ahead of us. He turned around and walked backward, 
waiting for us to catch up. “Mom and Dad should try the Doom Slide,” he said, 
grinning. “It’s awesome!” 

Had he really forgotten how terrified he was? 

“I don’t think they’d like it,” I said quietly. 

“Maybe we could find something that’s just a little scary,” Clay suggested. 

Dad laughed. “Are you having a good time, Clay?” 

Clay hesitated. “A little,” he replied finally. 

“I’m having a great time!” Luke declared. 

The path curved along a narrow brown river. Millions of tiny white insects 
flitted over the surface of the water. Catching the bright sunlight, they looked 
like little sparkling diamonds. 

A small brown boathouse came into view. Behind it, I could see slender 
canoes bobbing beneath a wooden dock. 

A sign beside the boathouse read: COFFIN CRUISE. 

A RELAXING FLOAT TO THE GRAVE. 

“This might be fun,” Mom said, her eyes on the small boats. 

“I think the river flows toward the front of the park,” Dad said. “Let’s take 
it!” 

Luke cheered and went running to the dock. 

I lingered behind the others. When I finally stepped out onto the dock, it 
took me a while to realize that the objects bobbing in the brown water weren’t 
canoes—they were coffins! 

They were made of black polished wood. The lids were pulled back, 
revealing red satin interiors. Each coffin was big enough for one person. 

I felt a cold chill run down my back. “We’re really going to climb into 
coffins?” I asked. 

“They look comfy,” Mom said, smiling at me. “The water is flat and gentle, 
Lizzy. It won’t be a scary ride.” 

“Me first!” Luke cried, running to the end of the wooden dock. 

Two costumed Horrors appeared to help us into the coffins. “Lie back. 
Enjoy the ride,” one of them said. 

“It will be your last,” the other Horror added with a low chuckle. 

When we were all inside coffins, the Horrors untied them and gave us a 
hard push away from the dock. 

Here I am, I thought, lying in my coffin. 



Here we all are, my entire family, on our backs in our coffins. 

The coffin floated gently, bobbing in the water. I stared up at the bright blue 
sky. Trees shimmered on both banks as I floated past. 

It was so pretty, so relaxing. 

Why did I think something terrible was about to happen? 



18 


Lying on my back, I couldn’t see the others over the coffin sides. But I could 
hear the splash of their coffins around mine. 

“This is nice,” Mom said. “Very relaxing.” 

“It’s boring!” Luke declared from up ahead of me. “Where’s the scary 
part?” 

“It’s just a nice ride in a coffin,” Dad said. “Do you think we’re really 
floating? Or do you think the coffin is on some kind of track?” 

“I could float like this for hours,” Mom said. 

“The rides here are pretty long,” Clay told her. 

“Is that a hawk up in the sky?” Dad asked. “Can everyone see it?” 

Shielding my eyes from the sun with one hand, I searched the sky. Directly 
above, a dark shadow hovered high in the sky, a little bigger than a dot. 

“It’s not a hawk. I’ll bet it’s a vulture!” Luke declared. “It sees the coffins, 
and it’s waiting to eat our flesh!” He laughed. 

“Luke—where do you get these hideous ideas?” Mom demanded. 

“Maybe Luke should live in HorrorLand!” Dad exclaimed. “We could get 
him one of those green monster costumes, and he’d fit right in perfectly!” 

“He doesn’t need a costume!” I joked. I was starting to feel a little better. 
The ride was gentle and relaxing. And I figured nothing terrible could happen 
with my whole family around. 

I settled back on the coffin bottom, my hands resting at my sides, and stared 
up dreamily at the bird circling high in the clear sky. The coffin bobbed gently, 
making soft splashing sounds. 

So pleasant... 

So quiet... 

And then, before I could utter a sound, the coffin lid slammed shut over me. 
And I was trapped in total darkness. 



19 


“Hey!” I shouted. My voice was muffled by the heavy lid over me. 

I could hear the dull thud of the other coffin lids slamming shut. 

“Hey—let me out!” 

I pushed against the lid with both hands. But it wouldn’t budge. 

I took a deep breath and tried again. This time, I pushed with my hands and 
my feet. The heavy lid still didn’t move. 

My heart was pounding so hard, I thought my chest would explode. The air 
inside the closed coffin was already getting hot and stuffy. 

“Open up! Open up!” I screamed. 

I tried pushing the lid again. I could hear Clay’s muffled cries in the coffin 
next to mine. The poor guy was screaming his head off. 

I let out a loud groan as I pushed up with all my strength. The lid wouldn’t 
give an inch. 

Calm down, Lizzy. Calm down, I instructed myself. It’s just a stupid ride. 
The coffin lid will open any second. 

Breathing hard, I waited. 

I counted to ten. 

I counted to ten again. 

The lid didn’t snap open. 

I tried shutting my eyes and counting to fifty. When I reach fifty, I told 
myself, I’ll open my eyes, and the lid will be open. 

“...twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four...” I counted out loud. My voice 
sounded tiny and choked. It was getting hard to breathe. The air began to feel 
really stale. 

I stopped counting at twenty-five and opened my eyes. The lid hadn’t 
popped open. 

It’s so hot in here, I thought. The sun is beating down on the lid. There’s no 
air, and I’m going to fry! 

I tried to scream, but no sound came out. 

I gasped for air. 

Outside, I could hear muffled shouts and cries. 



Was that my mother screaming like that? 

“It’s just a ride,” I said out loud. “Just a stupid ride. The lid is going to pop 
— now! ” 

But it didn’t. 

The air was so hot, so hot and stale. 

Why didn’t the lid open? 

Why? 

I tried to force back my panic, but I couldn’t. My entire body was shaking 
and shivering. I felt cold perspiration drip down my forehead. 

“Something has gone wrong!” I cried out loud. “The lid is supposed to open 
—but it doesn’t!” 

Frantically, I pushed up with both hands. My arms ached from pushing so 
hard. But the lid didn’t move. 

The coffin bobbed and rocked in the water. 

I lowered my hands in defeat. I sucked in a mouthful of the hot, stale air. 
My chest was heaving. My body trembled. 

And then I felt my legs start to itch. A tingly feeling down near my ankles. 

Moving up my legs. 

An itchy, crawly feeling. 

Something was crawling slowly up my legs. 

Something small and prickly. 

“Ohh.” I let out a low, terrified groan. 

Spiders! 



20 


I tried to scratch my legs, but my arms weren’t long enough. Unable to move or 
bend in the cramped coffin, I couldn’t reach down to them. 

The tingling moved higher. 

I wanted to scream, but I started to cough. 

And then the coffin lid popped open. Bright sunlight made me shut my 

eyes. 

“Oh!” I pulled myself up to a sitting position. Blinking against the light, I 
saw the others already scrambling up out of their coffins. 

I scratched my legs furiously. To my surprise, there were no spiders. No 
bugs of any kind. 

The coffin had pulled up to a small dock. I braced both hands against the 
sides of the coffin and heaved myself to my feet. 

“Let’s get out of here!” I heard Clay cry. 

“That was horrible /” my mom shrieked. 

Luke didn’t say anything. His face was pale, and his black hair was matted 
to his forehead with sweat. 

“They really went too far!” Dad said angrily. “I’m going to complain.” 

“Let’s just go!” Mom told him. 

We all scrambled onto the dock. I helped pull Clay up. Then I took several 
deep breaths of fresh air. 

Dad ran off the dock toward the open plaza, and the rest of us hurried after 
him. “To the ticket booth!” he called back to us. “Right up there!” He pointed. 

The coffin ride had taken us to the front of the park. I could see the front 
gate and the row of green ticket booths to the right. 

“That ride was really gross!” Clay said, shaking his head. 

“My legs got all itchy. I thought it was ants!” Luke declared. 

“I thought it was spiders!” I told him. 

“I wonder how they did that,” Luke said thoughtfully. 

“I don’t care,” I replied. “I just want to get out of here. I hate this place!” 

“So do I,” Clay agreed. 

“They just go too far,” Mom said breathlessly, jogging to keep up with us as 



we followed Dad. “It isn’t any fun when a ride is that scary. I really had trouble 
breathing.” 

“So did I,” I told her. 

“Hey, how do we get home?” Luke suddenly demanded, staring at Mom. 
“Our car blew up.” 

“I think those people in the monster costumes will lend us a car,” Mom 
replied. “They told your father just to come to the ticket booth.” 

“Can we stop and get pizza?” Luke asked. 

“Let’s get out of this place and then worry about lunch,” Mom told him. 

The main plaza was totally empty. Not another living person. 

We followed Dad to the first ticket booth. He turned back to us, making a 
disappointed face. “Closed,” he said. A metal grate had been pulled over the 
window. 

Dad was breathing hard from running all the way. He pushed his blond hair 
off his sweaty forehead with both hands. “Over here,” he said. 

We followed him to the next ticket booth. Also closed. 

Then the next. Closed. 

It didn’t take us long to discover that all of the ticket booths were closed. 

“Weird,” Luke said, shaking his head. 

“Don’t they expect any more visitors today?” Mom asked Dad. “How can 
they just close up like that?” 

Dad shrugged. “We’ll have to ask someone.” His eyes searched the empty 
grounds. 

I turned and checked out the plaza along with him. Still no one in sight. No 
visitors. No Horrors. 

“Let’s try over there,” Dad said. He started walking to a low green building 
that stood beyond the ticket booths. It looked like some kind of office. 

It was closed, too. Dad tried the door. It was locked. 

Dad scratched his head. “What’s going on here? Where’d everyone 
disappear to?” he demanded. 

Mom took his arm. “It’s very strange,” she said softly. 

I glanced at Luke and Clay. They were standing tensely side by side on the 
walk in front of the office. Neither of them spoke. 

“Are you sure these are the right ticket booths?” I asked. 

“Yes,” Dad replied wearily. “This is the front entrance.” 

“So where can everyone be?” Mom asked, chewing her lower lip. 



“Maybe we can find someone in the parking lot,” I suggested. “You know. 
A parking attendant or something. They’ll be able to tell us how to get a car to 
go home.” 

“Good idea, Lizzy,” Dad said. He patted the top of my head, the way he 
used to when I was a little girl. 

I waited for Luke to make fun of me. But he didn’t say a word. I guess he 
was too worried and upset. 

“Come on,” I urged. I turned and ran past the empty ticket booths. The tall 
metal front gate to HorrorLand stood just beyond the booths. 

I stopped for a second to read a sign on the side of one of the ticket booths. 
It said: NO EXIT, NO ONE LEAVES HORRORLAND ALIVE! 

“Ha-ha,” I said sarcastically. “These signs are a riot, aren’t they?” 

I jogged the rest of the way and reached the gate first. I pulled it, and it 
wouldn’t open. So I tried pushing it. 

It didn’t move. 

Then I saw the heavy chain and the large steel padlock on the gate. 

Swallowing hard, I turned back to the others. 

“We’re locked in!” I told them. 



21 


“What?” Dad stared at me, his face twisted in confusion. I don’t think he 
believed me. 

“We’re locked in!” I repeated. I lifted the heavy metal padlock with both 
hands and then let it fall back with a loud clang against the bars of the gate. 

“But that’s impossible!” Mom cried, raising her hands to her cheeks. “They 
can’t lock people inside an amusement park!” 

“Maybe it’s another joke,” Luke suggested. “Everything in this place turns 
out to be a joke. Maybe this is one, too.” 

I lifted the heavy padlock again. “It doesn’t look like a joke, Luke,” I said 
unhappily. 

“Then there must be another gate where they want us to exit,” Mom 
suggested. 

“Maybe,” Dad said doubtfully. “Maybe there’s a side exit. But I haven’t 
seen one.” 

“What are we going to do?” Clay asked, whining. His face was red, and he 
was breathing hard. 

“Where is everyone?” Luke demanded, whining, too. “They’ve got to let us 
leave. They’ve got to!” 

“Let’s try to stay calm,” Dad said, putting a hand on Luke’s shoulder. 
“There’s no reason to panic. This is a strange place, but we’re not in any 
danger.” 

“He’s right,” Mom broke in. “There’s no reason to be afraid. We’ll be out of 
here and on our way home in no time.” She forced a smile. 

“As soon as we get out, I’ll buy you guys pizzas and big, cold drinks,” Dad 
promised. “And we’ll all have a good laugh about our terrifying adventures 
today in HorrorLand.” 

“But how do we get out?” Luke demanded shrilly. 

“Well...” Dad rubbed his chin. 

“Do you think we could climb the fence?” I asked. 

We all raised our eyes to the top of the iron fence. It was way over our 
heads. It must have been about twenty feet tall. 

“I can’t climb that!” Clay cried. “I’d fall!” 



“It’s too high,” Mom said quickly. 

“Bad idea,” I murmured. 

A large white cloud drifted over the sun. Our shadows grew longer over the 
pavement. The air quickly grew cooler. 

I felt a chill run down my back. 

“There’s got to be a way out of this stupid park!” I cried angrily. I hoisted 
up the padlock and slammed it against the bars of the gate. 

“Hold on, Lizzy,” Dad said soothingly. “We just have to find one of those 
costumed park workers. They’ll tell us how to get out.” 

“Uh... Dad...” I turned and saw Luke grab Dad’s arm. “Here they come.” 

We all uttered astonished cries as we saw the Horrors crossing the plaza. 
Dozens of them. They moved quickly, with a steady rhythm. Silently. 

A few seconds before, the plaza had been empty. Now it was filled with 
green-costumed Horrors marching toward us, spreading out, preparing to 
surround us. 

I could feel the panic rise up from my stomach. My knees began to shake. I 
stared in horror at them as they drew closer, closer. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t 
move. 

“What are they going to do?” Clay cried, his features twisted in terror. He 
slipped behind Dad. “What are they going to do to us?” he cried. 



22 


We huddled together as the Horrors marched silently toward us. The only sound 
was the soft thud of their monster feet on the pavement, and their long purple 
tails dragging on the ground. 

“There are hundreds of them!” Mom murmured. She grabbed Dad’s arm 
with one hand. She slipped her other arm around my shoulders and pulled me 
closer. 

We had our backs against the iron fence. We stared helplessly at the 
grinning green faces, the bulging yellow eyes, which appeared to be laughing 
cruelly at us. 

Finally, they stopped a few feet in front of us. 

The plaza was still and silent. Terrifyingly silent. 

The sun was still hidden behind the big cloud. Two large blackbirds 
swooped low in the gray sky. 

We stared at the Horrors, and they stared back at us. 

I swallowed hard, leaning against my mother. I could feel her entire body 
trembling. 

I took a deep breath and then cried out: “What do you want?” The sound of 
my own voice startled me. 

One of the Horrors, a young woman, stepped forward. 

Frightened, I tried to back up. But my back was already pressing against the 
fence. 

“What do you want?” I repeated in a trembling voice. 

The costumed Horror stared at us one by one. “I want to thank you,” she 
said in a cheery voice. 

“Huh?” I uttered. 

“I’m the HorrorLand MC. We all want to thank you for being our guests 
today.” She flashed us a warm smile. 

“You mean we can go ? ” Luke demanded, half hidden behind my dad. 

“Of course,” the Horror said, grinning warmly. “But first we all want to 
thank you for appearing on HorrorLand Hidden Camera. ” 

The dozens of Horrors behind her broke into applause and loud cheers. 

“Huh? You mean this is some kind of show?” Dad demanded, frowning. 



“See the cameras?” the MC asked. She gestured up to two tall poles in the 
plaza. 

Raising my eyes to the top, I saw two TV cameras. 

“You mean we were on TV?” Luke cried. 

“Since the moment you arrived,” the MC replied. “Our hidden cameras 
followed you everywhere. From the hilarious scene where we blew up your car, 
our cameras were with you. And I know our home audience loved the terrified 
expressions on your faces and all of your horrified screams as you took our 
HorrorLand rides!” 

“Now, wait a minute,” Dad said angrily. He took a step forward. His hands 
were balled into tense fists at his sides. “You say this is a TV show? How come 
I’ve never seen it?” 

“We’re seen every weekend on The Monster Channel,” the Horror replied. 

“Oh,” Dad replied quickly, lowering his eyes. “We don’t have cable.” 

“You should get it,” the Horror told him. “You’re missing a lot of great 
scary shows on The Monster Channel.” 

The Horrors all clapped and cheered. 

“Well, you’ve been very good sports,” the MC continued, her yellow eyes 
bouncing in front of her head as she talked. “We’ve enjoyed having you. And to 
show our appreciation, we have a brand-new car waiting for you in the parking 
lot!” 

More cheers and applause from the Horrors. 

“Anew car? Excellent!” Luke exclaimed. 

“Does that mean we can leave?” Clay asked timidly. 

The Horror nodded. “Yes, it’s time for you to leave. The real exit is right 
over there, through that doorway.” 

She pointed to a tall green building near the end of the fence. I saw a yellow 
door on the side. 

“Take the yellow door,” the Horror instructed. “And thanks again for 
appearing on HorrorLand Hidden Camera /” 

As all the Horrors clapped their big green hands, we stepped away from the 
fence and hurried toward the exit. “I can’t believe we were on TV the whole 
time!” Mom declared. 

“And we’re getting a new car!” Luke exclaimed happily. He started 
jumping up and down. Then he leaped onto Clay’s back, nearly knocking him 


over. 



I laughed. It was good to see the old Luke back with us. 

“We’ve got to get cable!” Luke told Dad. “I want to see The Monster 
Channel. It’s got to be awesome!” 

“We’ll have to order it so we can see ourselves,” Mom said. 

I reached the yellow door first and pulled it open. I stepped into an 
enormous room, with white walls that shone under the bright white lights from 
the ceiling. 

“Is this the exit?” I cried. 

As soon as we were all inside, the door slammed shut with a bang that 
made my heart skip. 

Then all the lights went out. 

“Welcome to the HorrorLand Challenge!” boomed a deep, frightening voice 
over a loudspeaker. 

“Huh?” I gazed blindly around, trying to see something—anything—in the 
total darkness. 

“You have one minute to go through the Monster Obstacle Course,” the 
voice thundered. “Please keep in mind that the games are now over. This is real. 
You’re playing for your life!” 



23 


“We’ve been tricked!” I heard Dad cry angrily. And then he shouted at the top of 
his lungs, “Let’s get out of here!” 

“Run!” the deep voice boomed over the loudspeaker. “You have fifty-six 
seconds.” 

Dad started to shout again. But we stopped when a dim light came up, and a 
disgusting four-armed creature stepped toward us. 

“Ohhh!” I cried out without even realizing it. 

The size of a gorilla, the monster had huge green eyes surrounded by thick 
red fur over its face. Saliva drooled from its mouth. And as it opened its jaws 
wider, two rows of long fangs slid over its thin purple lips. 

“Don’t just stand there! Run! This is an obstacle course!” the voice boomed 
impatiently. “You have fifty seconds to live! At least make a good race of it.” 

The monster uttered a low growl and lumbered toward us in the dim light. 
Its jaws were opened wide as if preparing to bite. Its four enormous clawed 
hands swiped at the air in front of it. 

I was too stunned to move, too frightened to run. 

But suddenly, I felt a hand grab mine and tug me hard. 

It was Dad, I realized, trying to pull me to safety. 

I heard the boys screaming in fear. I felt Mom brush beside me as we 
started to stumble forward. 

“Run! Run!” the deep voice urged over the shrieks of the two boys. 

I couldn’t see where I was running. The light was so dim, so shadowy. I 
saw only a blur now, a blur of running feet, of moving shadows. 

The monster let out a deafening roar. I covered my ears and kept running. 

Its four clawed hands swiped at Dad. Missed. 

We hurtled past it. 

Only to face two giant birds, at least ten feet tall. They looked like cranes. 
They squawked and flapped their enormous wings. It sounded like canvas tents 
flapping in a strong wind. 

“Ohh! Help!” 

Was that me shrieking like that? 

Was I really being wrapped in their hot, flapping wings? Smothered? 



Choked? 

“No—p/ease!” 

How did I break away? 

Was I being chased now by six growling piglike creatures with sharp, 
pointed teeth curling from their twisted mouths? 

The screams and terrified shrieks of my family rose over the beating birds’ 
wings, the monstrous growls and grunts. 

I heard Dad cry out. And in the dim light, I saw him struggling to free 
himself from the four-armed creature. 

“No!” I screamed as I felt something warm wrap around my ankle. A fur- 
covered snake! 

I screamed again and kicked wildly, sending it flying into the darkness. 

But before I could move away, another furry snake spun around my leg, 
tightening quickly. 

I bent and pulled at it as it hissed in protest. 

I tossed it aside. 

“Run! Run!” the voice on the loudspeaker boomed. “Twenty seconds to 
live!” 

More monsters loomed in front of us. Disgusting yellow lizardlike creatures 
with dark flicking tongues like bullwhips. A hopping furry ball that roared as it 
hopped, sharp teeth poking out of three mouths. 

Hissing snakes, enormous buzzing insects with glowing red eyes, more 
gmnting pig monsters. Then a giant bearlike creature came at us on two legs. It 
tossed its dark, round head back and laughed like a hyena as its paws punched 
the air. 

“Help me!” I heard Luke shriek. And then I saw him disappear, wrapped 
inside the beating wings of one of the giant birds. 

The bird cawed in triumph as its wings tightened around my brother. 

“Ten seconds!” the voice boomed. 

“No!” I cried. I lunged toward the bird, grasped the beating wing, and 
pulled it open. 

Luke slid out, and we both began to run. 

Monsters growled, and flapped, and grunted, and roared. 

“Are we... going to make it?” Luke asked in a tiny voice. 

I didn’t have a chance to answer. 

Two powerful paws grabbed me around the waist, hoisted me high in the 



air, then slammed me to the floor. 

I landed hard on my stomach. My forehead hit the floor. 

Dizzy and hurt, I looked up in time to see an enormous elephantlike 
creature about to flatten me with its huge furry back foot. 

I’m not going to make it, I realized. 

I’m not going to make it. 



24 


The enormous flat foot lowered over me slowly, steadily. The monster was 
taking its time. 

It all seemed to be happening in slow motion. 

I wanted to move. I wanted to roll out from under it. 

But the fall had taken my breath away. I lay there gasping, watching the 
monster foot coming down to crush me. 

“Ohhh.” I couldn’t catch my breath. I couldn’t squirm away. 

I could feel the heat of the monster foot. I could smell its putrid sweat. 

The foot pressed down on my stomach. 

I shut my eyes and waited for the pain. 

The jarring blast of a buzzer made my eyes shoot open. 

The monster raised its heavy foot from my body. The floor shook under its 
weight as it began to lumber away. 

Am I alive? I wondered. 

Or am I only dreaming that I’m still alive? 

Is that creature really leaving without crushing me? 

The buzzer echoed in my ear. Then it abruptly stopped. The loudspeaker 
crackled on. 

“Time’s up!” a woman’s voice said. The voice of the HorrorLand MC who 
had led us to this terrifying obstacle course. 

“Time is up. What a thrilling race!” she gushed. 

I groaned and started to pull myself up. In the dim light, I saw that all of the 
monsters had vanished. 

“That was a tough battle,” the MC continued over the loudspeaker. “Do we 
have any survivors?” 

“Yes, we do,” the deep, booming voice replied. 

“How many survivors do we have in there?” the woman asked. 

“Three,” the booming voice replied. “Three survivors out of five.” 



25 


A cold chill ran down my body. 

I opened my mouth in a silent cry of shock and leaped to my feet. 

Three out of five? 

Did that mean that two of us were dead? 

My chest still ached. My knees were trembling. I squinted into the dim 
light, searching desperately for the others. 

Halfway across the room, I saw Luke and Clay. They were huddled 
together, walking as if in a daze toward the far wall. 

“Hey!” I tried to call to them. But my voice came out a choked whisper. 

Where were Mom and Dad? 

Were they both killed by the monsters? 

Three out of five. Three out of five. 

“Nooooooooo!” I finally found my voice and let out a horrified wail that 
echoed off the walls. 

“Excuse me. A slight mistake,” the deep voice boomed. “Make that five out 
of five survivors.” 

“Five out of five!” the HorrorLand MC exclaimed. “A new record. We’ve 
never had a perfect score before. Let’s give them a round of applause, 
everyone!” 

I took a deep breath and held it, trying to stop my trembling. 

They’re okay! I thought happily. Mom and Dad are okay. 

And then I saw them. They had their arms around Luke and Clay and were 
making their way toward me. 

“We’re okay!” I cried, rushing to them, my arms outstretched. “We’re 
okay!” 

All five of us huddled in the center of the dark room, hugging each other 
and sobbing. 

Dad’s arm was bleeding from a deep gash. One of the monsters had clawed 

him. 

Aside from that, we were shaken but not hurt. 

“Now what?” Luke asked in a trembling voice. “Are they going to let us 



go?” 

“They can’t get away with this,” Dad said angrily. “They can’t do this to 
people and get away with it. I don’t care if it is TV!” 

“Those monsters were real!” I exclaimed with a shudder. “It wasn’t a fake. 
They were really trying to kill us.” 

“How do we get out?” Luke demanded. “Will they let us out?” 

We all started chattering at once, our voices high and frightened. 

Suddenly, the ceiling lights flashed on, flooding the room with bright light. 
And the MC’s voice broke through our frightened conversation. “Let’s bring our 
winners out with a round of applause! ” she announced cheerfully. 

We all cried out as the floor began to tilt beneath us. I grabbed on to Dad, 
and we started to slide. 

The floor tilted down like a sliding board. And we slid out of the room— 
and landed in the plaza outside. 

Still feeling dazed, I jumped quickly to my feet as the HorrorLand MC 
hurried to greet us. The big crowd of Horrors behind her was clapping and 
cheering. 

“You can’t do this to us!” I screeched. 

I was so angry, I didn’t know what I was doing. I just totally freaked. 

I leaped at the woman, grabbed the top of her mask, and started to pull it off 
with both hands. 

“You can’t do this! You can’t!” I shrieked. “Let me see your face! Let me 
see who you really are!” 

Using all of my strength, I gave the mask a hard tug. 

Then I screamed and let go as I realized the truth. 



26 


She wasn’t wearing a mask! 

The monstrous green face was her face. 

She wasn’t wearing a monster costume. None of the Horrors were wearing 
costumes, I realized. 

I stepped back, raising my hands in horror as if trying to shield myself. 
“You—you’re really monsters!” I stammered. 

They nodded back at me, pleased grins on their ugly faces. Their yellow 
eyes bobbed gleefully. 

“You—you’re all monsters!” I screamed. “But—but you said this was a TV 
show,” I stammered to the Horror MC. 

Her bulging yellow eyes gazed at me. “We’re happy to say it is the top- 
rated show on The Monster Channel,” she said cheerily. “Thanks to great 
contestants like you and your family. The Monster Channel is watched by nearly 
two million monsters all over the world.” 

“But—but—” I stammered, taking another step back. 

“People don’t always take us seriously,” she continued. “People come to 
HorrorLand and think it’s all a big joke. People laugh at the signs around the 
park. They laugh at the rides and attractions. But it’s all very serious to us. All of 
it.” 

My father stepped up beside me, shaking a fist angrily. “But you can’t do 
this to innocent people!” he shouted. “You can’t bring people into this park to 
torture them, and—and—” 

“Oh, I’m sorry. Our time is up,” the MC interrupted, shaking her enormous 
green head. “I’m sad to say it’s time to say good-bye to our special guests for 
this week.” 

“Now, wait—” Dad shouted, raising both hands for quiet. 

The crowd of Horrors silently pushed forward. We had no choice but to 
start moving with them. 

“Let me show you people the way we say good-bye on HorrorLand Hidden 
Camera, ” the MC said. 

Dad tried to hold back, to resist, but several Horrors bumped against him. 
They were bumping all of us now, pushing us toward what appeared to be a 



round purple pond just beyond the plaza. 

We couldn’t fight back. There were too many of them. 

We couldn’t run. They had us surrounded. 

They drove us like sheepdogs herding cattle. In a few seconds, we were 
standing at the edge of the purple pond. 

A foul smell rose up from the pond. The purple liquid bubbled and gurgled, 
making a sick sucking sound. 

“Let us go!” Luke cried shrilly. “We want to go home!” 

The HorrorLand MC ignored his frantic pleas and stepped to the edge of the 
gurgling pond. “Saying good-bye is always sad,” she said. “So we try to have a 
little fun with our farewells.” 

“Just let us go!” Luke insisted. Dad put a hand on his shoulder to try to 
comfort him. 

We all stared at the MC as she raised a large rock in one hand and held it 
over the disgusting, bubbling pond. “Watch,” she instructed us with a smile. 

She let the rock drop into the pond. 

As soon as it touched the thick surface, it was pulled down with a loud 
sucking sound. 

“See how easy it is to say good-bye?” the Horror said, turning to us. “Now, 
will you jump in—or do you want to be pushed?” 



27 


Silently, the Horrors began moving in on us. Closer. Closer. 

Backing up, Clay tripped over my foot and nearly fell into the gurgling 
purple pit. I grabbed him and held on to him until he regained his balance. 

All five of us were standing at the edge of the pit. 

The sour odor swept over me. I felt sick. The thick purple slime lapped up 
at my ankles as if reaching out to grab me. 

“Mom! Dad!” I cried. I didn’t know what I expected them to do. We were 
all helpless. 

I knew we weren’t going to escape this time. 

Without realizing it, we were all holding hands. 

“Will you jump in—or do you want to be pushed?” The MC repeated her 
question. 

“I’m real sorry,” Dad murmured to us, ignoring her. “I’m real sorry I 
brought you here. I—I didn’t know...” His voice broke. He lowered his eyes. 

“Dad, it’s not your fault!” I told him, squeezing his hand. 

And as I squeezed his hand, I had an idea. 

A wild idea. A stupid idea. A really crazy idea. 

I knew I had to try it. It was the only idea I had. 

“People laugh at everything in the park,” the HorrorLand MC had told us. 
“But it’s all very serious to us,” she’d said. 

All very serious ... 

Very serious... 

She stood right in front of me now, waiting for us to jump to our deaths, 
eager for us to get sucked down into the purple slime. 

I knew this was my last chance. I knew it was crazy. 

But I knew I had to try it. 

I stepped up to the MC, reached out, and pinched her arm as hard as I 
could. 



28 


Her mouth opened wide, and she let out a startled gasp. 

She tried to pull her arm away. But I held on and pinched harder. “The Mad 
Pincher strikes again!” I shouted, remembering Luke’s annoying cry. 

Her yellow eyes rolled around crazily. “No!” she pleaded. 

Harder. Harder. 

And then I was the one to cry out as her mouth opened wide, and, with a 
loud whoosh, a rush of air escaped her lips. 

I leaped back. 

As the air rushed from her mouth, she appeared to deflate, just like a 
balloon. 

I gaped in amazement as she folded helplessly to the ground. 

An angry cry rose up from the crowd of Horrors. “Inflate her!” one of them 
yelled. “Inflate her immediately!” 

They began moving in on us, growling and grumbling menacingly. 

“Pinch them!” I shouted to my family. “Pinch them! The ‘No Pinching’ 
signs that we thought were so stupid—they were serious! The Horrors deflate if 
they’re pinched!” 

A Horror stepped up, arms outstretched to push me into the pond. I pinched 
his arm hard, and a few seconds later, he deflated. 

I heard the whoosh of air escaping to my right and saw that Luke had 
deflated one, too. 

Whoosh! Another one deflated and folded to the pavement. 

That’s all it took. 

The plaza filled with frightened cries and gasps of horror. 

The alarmed Horrors turned and ran. Stampeded is a better word. They 
scattered through the park, screaming as they ran. 

Taking a long, deep breath, I happily watched them flee. “See? I always 
come through in a pinch!” I said, amazing myself by making a joke. 

I don’t think anyone else in my family heard me. They were shouting for 
joy, hugging each other, jumping up and down. 

“Let’s get out of here!” I shouted. I started running toward the front gate. 
The others followed close behind. 



The gate was open now. I guess the Horrors had opened it, figuring the only 
place we were heading was to the bottom of the purple pond. 

Without looking back, we ran out into the empty parking lot. 

And stopped. 

“No car,” I murmured. 

In all the excitement, I had forgotten that our car had been blown up. 

I let out a weary sigh. I felt as if I were deflating, just like the Horrors. 
“Now what?” I asked, staring across the enormous flat parking lot. 

“It’s too far to walk!” Luke wailed. “How do we get out of here?” 

“The buses!” Mom cried, pointing. I turned my eyes to the row of purple- 
and-green buses parked on the side of the lot. They glowed under the bright 
afternoon sun. 

“Yeah!” Dad cried excitedly. “Maybe we can start one up and get away 
from here!” 

We started jogging over the pavement to the buses. “Cross your fingers,” 
Dad called, leading the way. “Maybe they leave the keys in them. It’s our only 
chance!” 

“Hurry!” Luke shouted suddenly. “They’re coming!” 

My heart leaped in my chest. I turned back toward the gate. 

Sure enough, the Horrors were pouring out of the park, chasing after us. 
“Give up! You cannot escape!” one of them screamed. 

“No one ever escapes!” another Horror shouted. 

“Hurry!” Luke cried. “Hurry! They’re going to catch us!” 



29 


With the Horrors close behind, shouting and threatening us, we ran full speed 
toward the row of buses. 

My heart was pounding almost as loud as my sneakers against the 
pavement. My throat ached, and I had a sharp pain in my side. 

But I kept running. 

“You cannot escape!” 

“Stop now!” 

“Give up!” 

The angry cries of the Horrors sounded even closer. But I didn’t turn back 
to see if they were catching up. 

The door to the first bus was open. Dad got there first and scrambled up the 
steps and inside. 

Mom stepped in, followed by the two boys. 

I pulled myself inside and the bus door slid shut behind me. “Dad—the 
keys!” I choked out. 

“Yes! They’re here!” he cried happily. “Hold on! We’re getting away!” 

The engine coughed, then started up with a roar. Dad lowered his foot on 
the gas pedal, and the bus shot forward. I stumbled down the aisle and fell into a 
seat behind Luke and Clay. 

“Hurry! They’re coming! They’re coming!” Luke and Clay were screaming 
in unison. 

I could hear the angry shouts of the Horrors through the closed bus 
windows. 

“We’re okay!” Dad cried, leaning over the big steering wheel. “We’re okay! 
We’re outta here!” 

“Yes!” I shouted happily. “Yes!” 

We all started to cheer. We kept cheering until we were out of the parking 
lot and back on the highway. 

We laughed and celebrated all the way home. 

The drive took hours and hours, but we didn’t care. We were safe! We had 
escaped! 

It was night when Dad pulled the bus up our driveway. “Home, sweet 



home!” I cried joyfully. 

We all piled eagerly out of the bus. I took a deep breath and stretched. The 
air smelled so sweet and fresh. A full moon made the front lawn shine. 

Then I saw him. It was a Horror, and he was clinging to the back of our bus. 
“Oh, no!” I cried out. 

“What are you doing there?” Dad demanded. 

“Did you ride there the whole way home?” Luke asked in disbelief. 

I shrank back as the Horror let go of the bus and slid to the ground. His 
yellow eyes studied us menacingly. He moved toward us quickly. 

Clay and Luke hid behind Dad. Mom’s mouth dropped open in fright. 

“What do you want?” I cried. 

He reached out his green hand. “Here,” he said. “We forgot to give you 
your free passes for next year!” 






WHY I'M AFRAID 
OF BEES 
Goosebumps - 17 
R.L. Stine 


1 


If you’re afraid of bees, I have to warn you—there are a lot of bees in this story. 
In fact, there are hundreds. 

Up until last month, I was afraid of bees. And when you read this story, 
you’ll see why. 

It all started in July when I heard a frightening buzz, the buzz of a bee. 

I sat up straight and searched all around. But I couldn’t see any bees 
anywhere. The scary buzzing sound just wouldn’t stop. In fact, it seemed to be 
getting louder. 

“It’s probably Andretti again,” I told myself. “Ruining my day, as usual.” 

I’d been reading a stack of comic books under the big maple tree in my 
back yard. Other kids might have better things to do on a hot, sticky summer 
afternoon—like maybe going to the pool with their friends. 

But not me. My name is Gary Lutz, and I have to be honest. I don’t have 
many real close friends. Even my nine-year-old sister, Krissy, doesn’t like me 
very much. My life is the pits. 

“Why is that?” I constantly ask myself. “What exactly is wrong with me? 
Why do all the kids call me names like Lutz the Klutz? Why does everybody 
always make fun of me?” 

Sometimes I think it might be because of the way I look. That morning, I’d 
spent a long time studying myself in the mirror. I’d stared at myself for at least 
half an hour. 

I saw a long, skinny face, a medium-sized nose, and straight blond hair. Not 
exactly handsome, but not terrible. 

Bzzzzzz. 

I can’t stand that sound! And it was coming even closer. 

I flopped over on my stomach. Then I peered around the side of the maple 
tree. I wanted to get a better view of my neighbor’s yard. 

Oh, no, I thought. I was right. The buzzing sound was coming from Mr. 
Andretti’s bees. My neighbor was at it again. He was always hanging out in the 
back by his garage, messing with those bees of his. 

How could he handle them every day without worrying about getting 
stung? I asked myself. Didn’t they give him the creeps? 



I climbed to my knees and edged a few inches forward. Even though I 
wanted to get a better look at Mr. Andretti, I didn’t want him to see me. 

The last time he caught me watching him, he made a big deal out of it. He 
acted as if there were some kind of law against sitting outside in your own back 
yard! 

“What’s this?” he bellowed at the top of his lungs. “Did someone start a 
neighborhood watch committee without informing me? Or is the FBI recruiting 
ten-year-old spies these days?” 

This last remark really steamed me, because Mr. Andretti knows perfectly 
well that I’m twelve years old. After all, my family has lived next door to him for 
my entire life. Which is bad luck for me. Mainly since I’m afraid of bees. 

I might as well confess it right away. I’m scared of a few other things, too, 
such as: dogs, big mean kids, the dark, loud noises, and swimming in the ocean. 
I’m even scared of Claus. That’s Krissy’s dumb cat. 

But, most of all, I’m scared of bees. Unfortunately, with a beekeeper for a 
neighbor, there are always bees around. Hairy, crawly, buzzing, stinging bees. 

“Meow!” 

I jumped up as Claus the cat came creeping up behind me. “Why do you 
have to stalk me like that?” I cried. 

As I spoke, Claus moved forward and wrapped himself around my leg. 
Then he dug his long, needle-sharp claws into my skin. 

“Ouch!” I screamed. “Get away from me!” I cannot understand how Krissy 
can love that creature so much. She says he only jumps on me because he “likes” 
me. Well, all I can say is that I don’t like him! And I wish he would keep away 
from me! 

When I finally managed to chase Claus away, I went back to studying my 
neighbor. Yes, I’m scared of bees. And I’m fascinated by them, too. 

I can’t seem to stop watching Mr. Andretti all the time. At least he keeps his 
hives in a screened-in area behind his garage. That makes me feel pretty safe. 
And he acts as if he knows what he’s doing. In fact, he acts as if he’s the world’s 
greatest living expert on bees! 

Today, Mr. Andretti was wearing his usual bee outfit. It’s a white suit, and a 
hat with a wire-screen veil hanging down to protect his face. His clothes are tied 
with string at the wrists and ankles. He looks just like some kind of alien 
creature out of a horror movie. 

As my neighbor carefully opened and closed the drawerlike sections of his 



hanging hives, I noticed he wasn’t wearing any gloves. 

Once, when I was with my dad, Mr. Andretti had explained this to us. “It’s 
like this, Lutz,” he said. Lutz is my father, Ken Lutz. Naturally, during this entire 
conversation, Mr. Andretti had acted as if I wasn’t even there. 

“Your average beekeepers usually wear gloves,” he explained. “A lot of the 
brave ones use gloves with no fingers and thumbs so they can work with the 
bees more easily.” 

Mr. Andretti thumped himself on the chest and went on. “But your truly 
outstanding beekeeper—such as myself—likes to work with his bare hands. My 
bees trust me. You know, Lutz, bees are really a lot smarter than most people 
realize.” 

Oh, sure, I said to myself at the time. If they’re really so smart, why do they 
keep coming back to your hive and letting you steal all their honey from them? 

Bzzzzzz. 

The humming from Mr. Andretti’s hives suddenly grew louder and more 
threatening. I stood up and walked over to the fence between our two back yards. 
I gazed into the screened-in area to see what was going on. 

Then I gasped out loud. 

Mr. Andretti’s white suit didn’t appear white anymore. It had become black! 

Why? Because he was totally covered with bees! 

As I stared, more and more of the insects oozed out of their hives. They 
crawled all over Mr. Andretti’s arms and chest, and even on his head. 

I was so grossed out, I thought I might puke! 

Mr. Andretti’s hat and veil shimmered and bulged as if they were alive! 

Wasn’t he scared of all those stingers? 

As I leaned over the fence, Andretti suddenly yelled at me: “Gary—look 
out/” 

I froze. “Huh?” 

“The bees!” Mr. Andretti screamed. “They’re out of control! Run!” 



2 


I never ran so fast in my life! I charged across the yard and stumbled up the back 
steps of my house. 

I flung open the screen door and almost fell into the house. Then I stopped 
and leaned against the kitchen table, gasping for air. 

When I finally caught my breath, I listened hard. I could still hear the angry 
buzzing of the bees from the next yard. Then I heard something else. 

“Haw haw haw!” 

Somebody was laughing out there. And it sounded suspiciously like Mr. 
Andretti. 

Slowly, I turned around and peered out through the screen door. My 
neighbor was standing at the bottom of the back steps. He’d taken off his bee 
veil, and I could see that he had a huge grin on his face. 

“Haw haw! You should have seen the expression on your face, Gary. You 
never would believe how funny you looked! And the way you ran! 

I stared at him. “You mean your bees weren’t escaping?” 

Mr. Andretti slapped his knee. “Of course they weren’t! I have complete 
control of those bees at all times. They come and go, bringing nectar and pollen 
back from the flowers.” 

He paused to wipe some sweat off his forehead. “Of course, sometimes I 
have to go out and recapture a few lost bees with my net. But most of them know 
my hives are really the best home they can possibly have!” 

“So this was all a joke, Mr. Andretti?” I tried to sound angry. But that’s hard 
to do when your voice is shaking even harder than your knees! “It was supposed 
to be funny?” 

“I guess that’ll teach you to get a life and stop staring at me all day!” he 
replied. Then he turned and walked away. 

I was so angry! What a mean trick! 

It was bad enough having kids my age pick on me all the time. But now the 
grown-ups were starting in! 

I pounded my fist on the kitchen table just as my mother walked into the 
room. “Hi, Gary,” she said, frowning. “Try not to destroy the furniture, okay? I 
was just about to make myself a sandwich. Would you like one?” 



“I guess so,” I muttered, sitting down at the table. 

“Would you like the usual?” 

I nodded. “The usual” was peanut butter and jelly, which I never get tired 
of. For a snack, I usually like taco chips, the spicier the better. As I waited for 
my sandwich, I ripped open a new bag of chips and started chewing away. 

“Uh-oh.” Mom was rummaging through the refrigerator. “I’m afraid we’re 
out of jelly. Guess we’ll have to use something else.” 

She pulled out a small glass jar. “How about this with your peanut butter?” 

“What is it?” I asked. 

“Honey.” 

“Honey!” I shrieked. “No way!” 

Later, I was feeling lonely. I wandered over to the school playground. As I 
walked by the swing set, I saw a bunch of kids I knew from school. 

They were standing around on the softball diamond, choosing up sides for a 
game. I joined them. Maybe, just maybe, they’d let me play. 

“Gail and I are captains,” a boy named Louie was saying. 

I walked over and stood at the edge of the group. I was just in time. 

One by one, Louie and Gail picked players for their teams. Every kid was 
chosen. Every kid except one, that is. I was left standing by myself next to home 
plate. 

As I slumped my shoulders and stared down at the ground, the captains 
starting fighting over me. “You take him, Gail,” Louie said. 

“No. You take him.” 

“No fair. I always get stuck with Lutz!” 

As the two captains argued over who was going to be stuck with me, I 
could feel my face getting redder and redder. I wanted to leave. But then they all 
would have said I was a quitter. 

Finally, Gail sighed and rolled her eyes. “Oh, all right,” she said. “We’ll 
take him. But remember the special Lutz rule. He gets four strikes before he’s 
out!” 

I swallowed hard and followed my teammates out onto the diamond. At that 
point, luck was with me. Gail sent me to the outfield. 

“Go way out in right, Lutz,” Gail ordered. “By the back fence. Nobody ever 
hits it out there.” 

Some kids might be angry about being stuck so far away from the action. 



But I was grateful. If no balls were hit to me, I wouldn’t have a chance to drop 
them the way I always did. 

As I watched the game, my stomach slowly tied itself into a tight knot. I 
was last in the batting order. But when my turn at the plate finally came around, 
the bases were loaded. 

I picked up the bat and wandered out toward the plate. A groan rose up 
from my teammates. “Lutz is up?” somebody cried in disbelief. 

“Easy out!” yelled the girl playing first base. “No batter, no batter, no 
batter!” Everyone on the other team hooted and laughed. Out of the corner of my 
eye I saw Gail put her face in her hands. 

I ground my teeth together and started praying. Please let me get a walk. 
Please let me get a walk. I knew I could never hit the ball. So a walk was my one 
and only hope. 

Of course I struck out. 

Four straight strikes. 

“Lutz the Klutz!” I heard someone cry. Then a lot of kids laughed. 

Without looking back, I marched off the baseball diamond and away from 
the playground. I was heading home toward the peace and quiet of my own 
room. It might not be perfect, I thought. But at least at home no one teased me 
about being a klutz. 

“Hey, look, guys!” a voice shouted as I turned onto my street. 

“Hey—wow—it’s Lutz the Klutz!” someone else answered. 

“Lookin’ good, dude!” 

I couldn’t believe my bad luck. The three voices belonged to the biggest, 
meanest, toughest creeps in the entire neighborhood—Barry, Marv, and Karl. 
They’re my age, but at least five times as big! 

These guys are gorillas! I mean, their knuckles drag on the sidewalk! 

And when they’re not swinging back and forth on a tire swing in their 
gorilla cage, what’s their favorite activity? 

You guessed it. Beating me up! 

“Give me a break, guys,” I pleaded. “I’m having a bad day.” 

They laughed. 

“You want a break, Lutz?” one of them shouted menacingly. “Here!” 

I only had time to blink as I watched a huge, mean-looking fist heading 
right for my nose.

A long, painful ten minutes later, I walked through the back door of my house. 
Fortunately, my mom was somewhere upstairs. She didn’t see my bloody nose, 
scratched, bruised arms, and torn shirt. 

All I needed was for her to start fussing over me and threatening to call the 
other boys’ parents. If that happened, Barry, Marv, and Karl really would kill me 
the next time they saw me. 

As I crept up the stairs, Claus the cat came leaping out at me. 

“Yowl!” 

“Whoooooa!” I was so shocked, I almost fell back down the stairs. “Get 
away from me, you monster!” 

I pushed the cat away and hurried down the hall to the bathroom. I gazed 
into the mirror and almost heaved. I looked like road kill! 

I rinsed off my nose with ice-cold water. Then I cleaned off all the blood 
and staggered to my room. 

I took off my ripped-up T-shirt and hid it behind my bed. Then I put on a 
winter shirt with long sleeves. It would be hot, but it would hide my scratched 
arms. 

Downstairs in the kitchen, I found Mom and Krissy. Mom was getting out 
mixing bowls and eggs, and Krissy was tying a big apron around her waist. As 
usual, Claus was purring and wrapping himself around Krissy’s legs. Why did he 
act like such an innocent little kitten around her, and such a monster around me? 

“Hi, Gary,” my mom said to me. “You want to help us make peanut butter 
cookies?” 

“No, thanks,” I said. “But I’ll lick the bowl for you later.” I walked over to 
the table and picked up the bag of taco chips I’d left there before. 

“Well, at least you can help by getting that new jar of peanut butter out of 
the cupboard and opening it for me,” Mom said. “This recipe calls for a lot of 
peanut butter.” 

“Sounds good,” I said. “Just so long as it doesn’t have any honey in it.” 

I opened the cupboard door and took out the peanut butter. I tried to twist 
off the cap. I twisted as hard as I could, but the top just wouldn’t move. I banged 
the jar on the countertop and tried again. Still no luck. 



“Do you have a wrench or something around, Mom?” I asked. “This thing 
just won’t budge.” 

“Maybe if you ran hot water on it,” my mother began. 

“Oh, puh-lease!” Krissy said with a snort. Wiping her hands on her apron, 
she crossed the room and grabbed the jar away from me. 

With two fingers, she twisted off the cap. 

Then she started laughing her head off. My mom started laughing, too. 

Can you believe it? My own mother was laughing at me! 

“I guess you forgot to eat your oat bran this morning,” Mom said. 

“I’m leaving,” I muttered to Mom and Krissy. “Forever.” 

The two of them were laughing together. I don’t think they even heard me. 

Totally miserable, I stepped out the front door and slammed it hard behind 
me. I decided to ride my bike around the block a few times. When I went around 
to the side of the house and got it out of the garage, I started to cheer up a little 
bit. 

My bike is really awesome. It’s a new, blue, twenty-one speed, and it’s real 
sleek and cool. My dad gave it to me for my twelfth birthday. 

I jumped on my bike and headed down the driveway. As I turned onto the 
street, I saw some girls walking down the sidewalk. Out of the corner of my eye, 
I recognized them. 

Wow! I thought. It’s Judy Donner and Kaitlyn Davis! 

Both Judy and Kaitlyn go to my school. They’re really pretty and very 
popular. 

To be honest, I’ve had a major crush on Judy since the fourth grade. And 
once, at the fifth-grade picnic, she actually smiled at me. At least, I think it was 
at me. 

So when I saw those girls walking down the street, I decided it was a good 
time to try to be really cool. 

I flipped my baseball cap around so the brim was at the back of my head. 
Then I folded my arms across my chest and started pedaling no-handed. 

As I passed them, I glanced over my shoulder and flashed my most 
glamorous smile at Judy and Kaitlyn. 

Before my beautiful smile faded, I felt a tug at my sneaker. I realized 
instantly that my shoelace was caught in the chain! 

A horrible grinding sound filled the air. The bike jerked and lurched from 
side to side—and I lost control! 



“Gary—!” I heard Judy shriek. “Gary—look out for that car!” 



4 


CRAAAAAAACK. 

I didn’t see the lamppost until I hit it. 

As I toppled off my bike and shot sideways through the air, I heard the 
sound of metal crumpling, ripping, and shredding. 

I landed on my face in a deep, warm puddle of mud. 

I heard the car rumble past me. 

Slowly, I pulled my face out of the mud. 

Guess I didn’t look too cool, I thought bitterly. Maybe at least I’ll get a little 
sympathy. 

No way. 

I could hear Judy and Kaitlyn laughing behind me on the sidewalk. “Nice 
bike, Gary!” one of them called. They hurried away. 

I had never been so humiliated in all my life. If I could have, I would have 
put down roots in that mud puddle and turned myself into a tree. It might not be 
the most exciting life in the world. But at least no one laughs at a tree. 

I’m serious. At that moment, I would have happily traded lives with a tree. 
Or a bird. Or a bug. Or just about any other living object on the planet. 

With that sad thought, I decided to get myself up and out of there before 
anyone else came along. It took all my strength to peel my wrecked bicycle off 
the lamppost. Luckily, I didn’t have far to drag it. 

For the second time in the same afternoon, I crept into my house and up the 
stairs so I could get cleaned up before anyone saw me. Now, as I studied my 
reflection in the bathroom mirror, I saw there was no way I could hide all my 
cuts and scrapes from my mom. 

“Oh, who cares?” I moaned as I washed the mud off my face and hands. 
“Who cares if Mom sees them? I’ll be doing her a favor by giving her something 
else to laugh at. It’ll really make her day!” 

I went back into my room and changed into my last clean shirt. Then I 
glanced around, trying to find something to do. 

I decided to boot up my computer. Playing with my computer is one of the 
few things I really like. When I’m lost in the world of a computer game, 
sometimes I can actually forget I’m a total jerk named Gary Lutz. Nobody in a 



computer game ever calls me Lutz the Klutz. 

I turned on the computer and decided to have another try at the Planet 
Monstro Fantasy game I’d been stuck on for two days. Monstro is a really cool 
game. 

When you play it, you’re a character named The Warrior, and you’re 
trapped on the planet Monstro. You have to get yourself out of all kinds of scary 
situations. 

Before I started to play, I thought I’d check Computa Note, one of the 
electronic bulletin boards I’m connected to on the computer. 

I’d left a message there on Monday, asking if anyone knew how to defeat 
the two-headed dragon that kept eating me on the thirteenth moon of Monstro. 
Sometimes other people in the country who are playing the same game will send 
each other hints. 

When I accessed Computa Note, I saw the following computer-game- 
related messages on the screen: 

To Arnold in Milwaukee: Have you tried rubbing smashed-up eucalyptus leaves 
all over yourself in the rain forest game? It’s an ecologically correct way of 
repelling the poisonous ants in EcoScare 95. From Lisa in San Francisco 

To R from Sacramento: The only way to escape from the flood on your spaceship 
in SpaceQuest 20 is to inflate your suit and float away. From L in St. Louis 

To Gary in Millville: Try stabbing the dragon between the eyes. It worked for 
me. From Ted in Ithaca 

Oh, terrific, I thought. I’d been trying to stab the dragon between the eyes. But 
the creature always ate me before I could do it! What was “Ted in Ithaca” doing 
that I wasn’t? 

I decided to leave another electronic note, asking Ted to explain what he 
meant. But, as I started typing, I noticed another message at the very bottom of 
the computer screen. 

I read it. Then I read it again very carefully: 


TAKE A VACATION FROM YOURSELF. 
Change places with someone for a week! 



5 


What could that mean? 

I pressed the Enter button so I could read what was next. I desperately 
wanted more information about the message. This is what I saw: 

TAKE A VACATION FROM YOURSELF. 

Change places with someone for a week! 

PERSON-TO-PERSON VACATIONS 
113 Roach Street, Suite 2-B 
or call 1-800-555-SWAP 

How could it possibly work? I asked myself. How could two people change lives 
without getting into all kinds of trouble? 

I had to admit it sounded totally crazy. 

Crazy, but interesting. 

I yawned and scratched the back of my head. 

“Ouch!” My hand grazed one of the painful bumps I’d gotten from Barry, 
Marv, and Karl. 

It really hurt. But the stab of pain helped me make up my mind. I was 
definitely ready for some changes in my life. 

“I don’t want to spend the rest of my life getting beat up!” I told myself. 
“Or crashing into lampposts, either! Or being the last person chosen for the 
team!” 

I took out a piece of paper and copied the address from the screen. As I did, 
I realized it was only a few blocks from my school. I knew just where it was. I 
could stop by the Person-to-Person office the next day. 

I’m really going to check it out, I decided. 

Making up my mind like that improved my mood a lot. I was beginning to 
feel almost cheerful when I went back downstairs. But not for long. When my 
family sat down in the dining room for dinner, my father noticed my banged-up 
face. 

“Gary!” he exclaimed. “What in the world happened to you?” 



“Er,” I said. “I had a little accident on my bike.” I winced as I said the word 
“bike”. I was thinking about the mangled wreck in the corner of the garage. 

“I don’t believe that for a minute,” Mom said. “I’m sure you’ve been 
fighting with those big kids in the neighborhood again. Why in the world can’t 
you children learn to settle your disagreements peacefully?” 

Krissy started laughing so hard, she almost choked on her tuna casserole. 
“Gary doesn’t have any disagreements with those guys, Mom!” she said. “They 
just like to beat him up!” 

My mother shook her head angrily. “Well, I think that’s just outrageous!” 
she said. “I have a good mind to call those boys’ parents up right now and give 
them a piece of my mind!” 

I groaned loudly. “I’m telling you, Mom, I really had an accident with my 
bike. If you don’t believe me, go check it out in the garage.” 

Then my father did believe me. He started lecturing me about bike safety 
and why I should have been wearing my helmet and how I was going to have to 
pay to have the bike fixed with my own money. 

After a while, I stopped paying much attention. As I pushed my casserole 
around on my plate, all I could think about was my plan for changing my life 
with Person-to-Person Vacations. 

The sooner the better, I thought. The sooner I get out of this life, the better 
off I’ll be. 

We finished dinner, and I went upstairs to play on my computer again. I 
spent the rest of the evening with my Planet Monstro game. 

I kept trying to stab the dragon between the eyes. But even though I 
followed Ted from Ithaca’s advice, I couldn’t do it. The dragon ate me twenty- 
three times. 

Finally, I gave up and crawled into bed. I was so wiped out, I started 
drifting off to sleep almost right away. I turned over and pulled the blanket up 
under my chin. I curled up into a ball. The toes on my right foot touched 
something. 

“Huh?” I said out loud. “What is that down there?” 

My heart pounded in my chest. 

Slowly, I moved my toes again. 

“Ohhhhhh.” My blood turned into ice. 

I jumped out of bed and let out a bloodcurdling scream.

Frantically, I ripped the blankets off my bed. In the dim light coming in through 
the window, I could see the rat—fat and hairy, its red eyes gleaming at me. 

I screamed again. 

Then I heard laughter down the hall. Krissy’s laughter. 

My stomach sank. I made my way to the switch and turned on the light. 

Sure enough. The rat still stared at me from my bed. But now I recognized 
it. A gray rubber rat. One of Claus’ favorite toys. 

In her room down the hall, Krissy squealed with laughter. 

“I’m going to get you, you little brat!” I screamed. I thought about going 
down the hall and really thumping her. But I quickly decided against it. 

Even though Krissy is only nine, she happens to be pretty strong. There was 
an excellent chance she could beat me up. 

With an angry growl, I grabbed the rat off my bed and heaved it into the 
corner of my room. Then, my heart still pounding with rage, I turned off the light 
and climbed back under the covers. 

“Tomorrow,” I promised myself in the dark room. “Tomorrow, you, Gary 
Lutz, are going to check out that ad and find out if you can change your life. 
Even if it’s only for a week, it has to be better than this miserable life you have 
now!” 

The next day I kept my promise to myself. After breakfast, I walked the six 
blocks to Roach Street and started reading the street numbers, trying to find 
number 113. 

I guess I was looking for some kind of big, glass office building. But when I 
finally found number 113, it was on a small, gray building that looked something 
like my dentist’s office. A little sign on the outside read: 

PERSON-TO-PERSON VACATIONS, 

Suite 2-B 

I opened the door and walked up a flight of steps. At the top, I opened another 
door and went into a kind of waiting room with beige carpeting and tan leather 



chairs. 

A dark-haired woman sat behind a big glass window. She smiled at me 
when I came in, and I walked over to talk to her. 

“Good afternoon,” she said into a microphone. 

I jumped. Even though the woman was right in front of me, her voice came 
out through a speaker on the wall. 

“Uh... um,” I stammered nervously. “I came about the message on the 
electronic bulletin board?” 

“Oh, yes,” the woman replied with another smile. “A lot of people learn 
about us from their computers. Pardon me for staying behind this glass shield. 
But the equipment behind me is so delicate, we have to be very careful about 
protecting it.” 

I peered over the woman’s shoulder. I could see gleaming metal counters 
and a wall of electronic equipment, including what appeared to be heart 
monitors, video screens, X-ray machines, and cameras. It looked like something 
right out of Star Trek! 

I suddenly had a heavy feeling in my stomach. Maybe this is a bad idea, I 
thought. “Y-you probably don’t like kids hanging around in here,” I stammered. I 
started backing away toward the door. 

“Not true,” she said. “Many of our customers are young people such as you. 
A lot of kids are interested in changing places with someone else for a week. 
What did you say your name was?” 

“Gary. Gary Lutz.” 

“Nice to meet you, Gary. My name is Ms. Karmen. How old are you. About 
twelve?” 

I nodded. 

“Come over here for a minute,” Ms. Karmen said, motioning with her hand. 

Cautiously, I walked back over to the glass booth. She opened a little slot at 
the bottom of her window and pushed out a book. I picked it up and saw that it 
was a photo album, like the one my parents have from their wedding. 

I opened it and started looking through it. “It’s kids!” I exclaimed. “All 
about my age.” 

“Correct,” said Ms. Karmen. “They’re all interested in switching lives with 
someone else for a week.” 

“Wow.” I studied the album. 

A lot of the kids in the pictures looked big and strong. And cool. Kids like 



that wouldn’t be afraid of anything, I told myself. I wondered what it would be 
like to be one of them. 

“You can pick a boy—or even a girl, for that matter—to trade places with 
for a week,” Ms. Karmen was saying. 

“But how does it work?” I asked. “Do I just go take over somebody’s room 
and live in his house for a week? Go to his school? Wear his clothes?” 

The woman laughed. “It’s far more interesting than that, Gary. With our 
getaway vacations, you actually become the other person for a week.” 

“Huh?” 

“What we have,” the woman explained, “is a safe, painless way to switch 
one person’s mind into another person’s body. So, while you’ll know you’re 
really you, no one else will recognize you. Not even the other boy’s parents!” 

I was still confused. “But... what about my body? Does it get stored here?” 

“No, no. We here at Person-to-Person will find someone else to take over 
your body for the week. Your parents will never even know you’re gone!” 

I looked down at my skinny body and wondered who could possibly want 
to borrow it for a week. Ms. Karmen leaned forward in her chair. “So what do 
you say? Are you interested, Gary?” 

I stared into her dark brown eyes and swallowed hard. I broke into a cold 
sweat. This whole thing was really weird—and scary! “Uh,” I said. “I don’t 
know. I mean I’m just not sure.” 

“Don’t feel bad,” Ms. Karmen said. “Many people take some time to get 
used to the idea of a body switch. You can think it over for as long as you wish.” 

She took out a small camera. “But in the meantime, would you mind if I 
took your picture? That way, we can find out if anyone is interested in being in 
your body for a week.” 

“Well, I guess it’s okay,” I replied. 

She snapped the picture, and the flash went off in front of my eyes. “But 
I’m still not sure I want to go through with it.” 

“There’s no obligation,” Ms. Karmen said. “Why don’t we leave it this 
way? You fill out a form describing yourself. Then I’ll put your picture into our 
display album. And, when we find someone to take your place, I’ll call you to 
see if you’ve made up your mind.” 

“Okay,” I replied. What harm could that do? I asked myself. There was no 
way she would ever find anybody who’d want my body for a week! 

I spent a few minutes filling out the form. I had to write down my name and 



address. Then I had to tell all about my hobbies, and how well I did in school, 
and things like that. When I was finished, I handed it to Ms. Karmen, said good¬ 
bye, and headed out the door. 

I made it most of the way home without getting into trouble. A block and a 
half from my house, I ran into my three most unfavorite people in the world— 
Barry, Marv, and Karl. 

“Hey, guys!” Barry cried with an ugly smile. “The Klutz is up and walking 
around. That must mean we didn’t do a very good job of pounding him 
yesterday.” 

“No,” I insisted. “You did a good job. You did a very good job, guys!” 

I guess they didn’t believe me. They all jumped me at once. 

When they were finally finished—about five minutes later—I lay on the 
ground and watched them walk away through one swollen black eye. 

“Have a nice day!” Marv called back to me. All three of them roared with 
laughter. 

I sat up and pounded the ground with my fist. 

“I’m sick of this!” I wailed. “I want to be somebody else —anybody else!” 

Slowly and painfully, I dragged myself to my feet. “I’m doing it,” I decided. 
“And nobody’s going to stop me. Tomorrow I’m going to call Person-to-Person 
Vacations. I want them to put me into somebody else’s body. As soon as they 
can!”

I spent the next few days changing my Band-Aids and hoping the woman from 
Person-to-Person Vacations would call me. 

At first, I ran to answer the phone every time it rang. But of course it was 
never for me. Usually, it was one of Krissy’s dumb friends, wanting to giggle 
and gossip. 

One afternoon, I was reading a science-fiction book in my usual spot 
behind the big maple tree. I heard a sound, and peered around from behind the 
tree. 

Sure enough, there was Mr. Andretti walking across the lawn. He was 
dressed in his beekeeping outfit. As I watched, Mr. Andretti went to the 
screened-in area off the garage and started opening up the little doors to his 
beehives. 

Bzzzzzz. 

I covered my ears, but I couldn’t shut out the loud, droning hum. How I 
hated that sound! It was just so frightening. 

I shivered and decided it was time to go back inside. 

As I climbed to my feet, a bullet-sized object shot right by my nose. A bee! 

Were the bees escaping for real this time? 

I gasped and stared over at Andretti’s house. Then I almost choked. There 
was a big hole in the screen around the beekeeping area. 

A lot of bees were flying out! 

“Ow!” I cried out as a bee landed on the side of my head and buzzed loudly 
into my ear. 

Frantically, I batted it away. Then I ran toward the house. For one wild 
moment, I thought about calling the police or maybe the paramedics. 

But, as I slammed the back door, I heard an all-too-familiar sound. “Haw 
haw haw!” 

Once again, Mr. Andretti was laughing at me. 

I pounded my fist into my other hand. Oh, how I’d like to sock that guy in 
the nose! I thought. 

I was interrupted by the sound of the phone ringing. 

“Give me a break!” I cried as I stomped off to answer it. “Don’t Krissy’s 



moron friends have anything better to do than talk on the phone all day long?” 

“Whaddya want?” I snarled into the mouthpiece. 

“Is this Gary?” a woman’s voice asked. “Gary Lutz?” 

“Uh... yes,” I answered in surprise. “I’m Gary.” 

“Hi, Gary. This is Ms. Karmen. From Person-to-Person Vacations? 
Remember me?” 

My heart started thumping in my chest. “Yes. I remember,” I answered. 

“Well, if you’re still interested, we’ve found a match for you!” 

“A match?” 

“Correct,” said Ms. Karmen. “We’ve found a boy who wants to switch 
bodies with you for a week. Are you interested?” 

I hesitated for a few seconds. But, then, as I gazed out the back door of the 
kitchen, I saw a big, fat bee throwing itself against the outside of our screen 
door. “Haw haw!” Mr. Andretti’s scornful laughter boomed across the back yard. 

My mouth tightened into a thin line. “Yes,” I said firmly. “I’m really 
interested. When can we make the switch?” 

“Why, we could do it now,” said Ms. Karmen. “If that’s all right with you.” 

My pulse raced as I thought. My parents were both out for the afternoon, 
and Krissy was playing at a friend’s house. The timing was perfect. I’d never get 
another chance like this! 

“Now is great!” I exclaimed. 

“Terrific, Gary. It will take me about twenty minutes to get to your house.” 

“I’ll be waiting.” 

The next twenty minutes seemed to take forever. While I waited, I paced back 
and forth in the living room, wondering what my new body would be like. 

What would my new parents be like? My house? My clothes? Would I 
actually have some friends this time around? 

By the time Ms. Karmen arrived, I was a wreck. When the doorbell rang, 
my hand was sweating so much, I could barely turn the doorknob to let her in. 

“Let’s go in the kitchen,” Ms. Karmen suggested. “I like to set up my 
equipment on a table.” She opened a small case and took out some black boxes 
with monitors on them. 

I showed her the way to the kitchen. “So who’s this kid who wants to 
switch places with me?” I asked. 

“His name is Dirk Davis.” 



Dirk Davis! I thought excitedly. Even his name sounded cool. “What does 
he look like?” 

Ms. Karmen opened up a white photo album. “Here’s his picture,” she said, 
passing it to me. 

I looked down at a picture of a tall, athletic-looking blond boy in black 
Lycra bike shorts and a blue muscle shirt. I blinked in surprise. 

“He looks like a surfer or something!” I cried. “Why in the world does he 
want to switch bodies with me? Is this some kind of trick?” 

Ms. Karmen smiled. “Well, to be honest, it’s not exactly your body he’s 
interested in, Gary. He wants your mind. You see, Dirk needs someone who is 
good in math. He has some very hard math tests coming up in summer school. 
He wants you to take them for him.” 

“Oh,” I said. I felt relieved. “Well, I usually do pretty well on math tests.” 

“We know that, Gary. Person-to-Person does its homework. You’re very 
good at math. Dirk’s good at skateboarding.” 

I sat down at the table. 

Bzzzzzz. 

A bee buzzed right under my nose. “Hey!” I yelled, jumping back up. 
“How’d that bee get in here?” 

Ms. Karmen glanced up from her equipment. “Your back door is open just a 
bit. Now please sit down and try to relax. I need to fasten this strap around your 
wrist.” 

With a nervous glance at the back door, I sat back down. Ms. Karmen 
strapped a black band around my wrist. Then she started fiddling with some 
wires attached to one of her machines. 

Bzzzzzz. 

Another bee flew in front of me, and I wiggled around in my chair. 

“Please sit still, Gary. Otherwise the equipment won’t work.” 

“Who can sit still with all these bees buzzing around in here?” I asked. I 
lowered my eyes and saw three fat bees walking across the table. 

Bzzzzzz. 

Another bee flew past my right eye. 

“What’s up with these bees?” I was starting to panic. 

“Don’t pay any attention to them,” Ms. Karmen said, “and they won’t 
bother you.” She made one more adjustment to her machine. “Besides, Dirk 
Davis isn’t afraid of bees. And, as soon as I flip this switch, you won’t be, 



either!” 

“But...!” 

ZZAAAAPPPP! 

A blinding white light flashed in front of my eyes. 
I tried to cry out. 

But my breath caught in my throat. 

The light grew brighter, brighter. 

And then I sank into a deep pool of blackness.

Something was wrong. 

Colors returned. But they were a total blur. 

I struggled to make everything come clear. But I couldn’t seem to focus on 
anything. 

My new body didn’t feel right, either. I was lying on my back, and I felt 
light as a feather, light enough to float away. 

Could this be Dirk Davis’ tall, muscular body? It certainly didn’t feel like it! 

Was this some kind of trick? I asked myself. Was the picture of Dirk Davis 
a phony? Was he really a lot smaller than he looked in the photo album? 

I reached out one of my hands and tried to touch my stomach. But my hand 
felt really weird, too. It was small, and my arm seemed to be bending in several 
places at once! 

What’s going on? I wondered, trembling with fright. 

Why do I feel so weird? 

“Whooooa!” I cried out as I finally managed to touch my body. “Yuck.” My 
skin was soft. And it was covered with a fine layer of fuzz. 

“Help! Ms. Karmen! Help! Something’s wrong!” I tried to shout. 

But there was something wrong with my voice. It came out all tiny and 
squeaky. Little mouse squeaks. 

I rolled over onto my stomach and tried to get up. I spread my arms to 
balance myself. 

I gasped as I realized my feet weren’t even touching the ground! 

I was flying! 

“What’s happening to me?” I cried in my squeaky little voice. I floated 
forward and crashed into a kitchen cupboard. 

“Ow! Help me!” 

I moved my strange new arms and realized I had some control over which 
way I flew. I felt some weird muscles in my back going into action. Testing my 
new muscles, I flew over to the kitchen window. 

Exhausted, I landed on the sill. I turned my head to one side. Then I gasped 
in fright. 

A hideous monster was reflected in the window glass! 



The creature had two huge glaring eyes. And it was staring right at me. 

I tried to scream. But I was too terrified to utter a sound. 

I—I have to get away! I decided. 

I moved my feet and started to run. The monster in the glass ran, too. 

I stopped and stared at the window glass. The monster stopped and stared 
back at me. 

“Oh, no! Please—no!” I cried. “Please don’t let it be true!” I reached up and 
tried to cover my eyes. The creature in the window did the same thing. 

And suddenly I knew the hideous truth. The monster in the mirror—it was 
me. 

Ms. Karmen had messed up. Totally. 

And now I was trapped inside the body of a bee! 



9 


I don’t know how long I stood there. 

I couldn’t stop staring at my reflection. 

I kept waiting to come out of this nightmare. I kept waiting to blink my 
eyes and find myself in Dirk Davis’ big, muscular body. 

But I didn’t look at all like Dirk Davis. 

I had two giant eyes—one on either side of my head—and two skinny little 
antennas sticking out of my forehead. 

My mouth was truly disgusting. I had some kind of long tongue, which I 
soon discovered I could move all around and make longer and shorter if I 
wanted. Which I didn’t. 

My body was covered with thick, black hair. I had three legs on either side 
of my body. And let’s not forget the wings sticking out of my shoulders! 

“This is the pits!” I cried. “I’m a bug! I’m a disgusting, hairy bug! Ms. 
Karmen—something went wrong! Help me!” 

Creeeeak. 

Slam! 

What was that? 

Oh, no! I realized that Ms. Karmen had just gone out the kitchen door. 

“No—wait! Wait!” I squeaked. She was my only hope! 

I had to catch her. I had to tell her what had happened! 

“Ms. Karmen!” I squeaked. “Ms. Karmen!” 

Frantically, I flew out of the kitchen into the living room. Out the window, I 
could see her car still parked out in front of the house. 

But the front door to the outside was shut. And bees can’t open doors. I was 
trapped inside my own house! 

The back door! I remembered. Ms. Karmen had said it was open just a bit. 

Yes! That was how all those bees got into the house in the first place! 

I fluttered my new wings and flew back into the kitchen. As I soared, I 
realized I was getting more and more control over my flight pattern. 

But I didn’t care about that right now. All I knew was that I had to get to 
Ms. Karmen before she drove away. 



I darted out the tiny opening in the back door. “Ms. Karmen!” I shouted as I 
flew around the side of the house. “Ms. Karmen! Help me! You messed up! I’m 
a bee! Help me!” 

My voice was so tiny, she couldn’t hear me. She opened her car door and 
started to climb behind the wheel. My only chance for a normal life was about to 
drive away! 

What could I do? How could I get her attention? 

Thinking quickly, I flew right toward her head. “Ms. Karmen!” I shouted in 
her ear. “It’s me. Gary!” 

Ms. Karmen uttered a startled cry. Then she drew back her hand and 
swatted me. Hard. 

“Ow!” My entire body vibrated with pain. The force of her swat sent me 
falling to the street. I hit the pavement with a painful splat. 

I shook my head, trying to clear my eyes. That’s when I realized I had an 
extra set of tiny eyes arranged in a kind of triangle on the top of my head. I used 
them to gaze straight up. 

And then I screamed in terror. 

I saw the tire rolling toward me. 

Ms. Karmen was about to drive right over me. I was about to be squashed 
like the bug that I was! 



10 


“Oh!” I froze in panic. 

Even with my blurred bee vision, I could see the deep treads in the tire as it 
rolled steadily toward me. 

Closer. Closer. 

I have to move! I told myself. 

Fly away! Fly away! 

But in my panic, I forgot how to use my new muscles. 

I—Fm going to be squashed! I realized. 

I uttered a final, weak cry. 

And the car stopped. 

“Huh?” My entire body was trembling. But somehow I managed to pull 
myself up. Up into the air. 

Yes. I was flying now. 

I could see Ms. Karmen inside the car. She was fastening her seat belt. She 
had stopped the car to put on her seat belt! 

“Hey, seat belts really do save lives!” I told myself. 

I called out to her. But of course she couldn’t hear me. I watched the car roll 
away until it was a blur of color. 

Then, exhausted and terrified, I buzzed over to a nearby lilac bush and 
dropped onto a leaf. “That was too close!” I told myself, in between gasps for 
air. “I’m going to get killed out here!” 

A green caterpillar inched its way up onto a nearby stem and started 
chewing noisily on the leaf I was resting on. I’d never really examined a 
caterpillar before. Up close, they’re real ugly. They look a little bit like dragons. 
Only scarier. 

“Keep away from me!” I yelled in my tiny voice. The caterpillar didn’t 
even turn its head. Maybe it didn’t hear me. 

I forgot all about the caterpillar when I heard footsteps coming up the front 
walk. I turned my head and used my sideways eye to see who it was. 

“Mom!” I screamed. “Mom! Over here!” 

She couldn’t hear me. She hurried up the steps and into the house. 



Suddenly, I was overcome by a wave of sadness. My own mother didn’t 
recognize me! 

Desperately, I fluttered my wings and flew away from the leaf. I made my 
way to the front of the house, and started buzzing around the front windows. 

I had my wings under complete control by now. But the scene I saw inside 
the house was enough to make me fall down onto the ground again. 

My mother stood in the living room talking to me! Or at least, that’s what 
she thought. Only I knew it couldn’t be me. / was stuck outside. But who was in 
there with my mom? Had Dirk Davis managed to get inside my body? 

I landed on the ledge and stared into the house. My mom was talking. The 
boy was nodding and laughing. He said something to her. If I stared closely, I 
could read his lips. 

“Hey, did you buy taco chips? I’m really starving, Mom.” 

That had to be Dirk talking inside my body. 

My mom smiled at him and patted him on the arm. I read his lips and saw 
that he was calling her “Mom” again. How could he do that? How could he call 
my mother “Mom”? 

If bees could cry—which I now know they can’t—I would have started 
bawling right then and there. Who did that boy think he was? For that matter, 
what kind of mom did I have, who couldn’t even tell that a total stranger was 
living inside her son’s body? 

As I watched “myself” and my mom chatting in the living room, I totally 
lost it. Like a crazed maniac, I started bashing my insect body into the window. 

“Buzz!” I cried. “Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! It’s me, Gary. Look out here! Help 

me!” 

Again and again, I smashed myself up against the glass. But no one inside 
the house noticed. 

After a few minutes, Mom brought the new me a bag of taco chips. I 
watched “Gary” rip the bag open and take out a handful of chips. Crumbs fell on 
the living room carpet as he crunched the spicy chips. 

I realized I was starving. 

But what do bees eat? I asked myself. Desperately, I tried to remember 
everything I’d ever read about the creatures. 

I thought of the hungry caterpillar, crunching away on the leaf. But I was 
almost positive bees didn’t eat leaves. 

But what did they eat? Other bugs? Ugh! The thought made me shudder. I’d 



die before I’d eat a bug! 

I buzzed around the yard, hoping to see something—anything—I could use 
for food. As I flew, I found that I was getting used to my strange new vision and 
learning how to work my different sets of eyes. 

I remembered something I’d once read in an old picture book called The 
Big Book of Bees. It said that bee eyes each have thousands of tiny lenses 
crowded together. But, because they don’t have pupils, they can’t really focus 
their eyes. 

Interesting, I thought. But not very helpful. If I could remember about bees’ 
eyesight, why couldn’t I remember what they ate? 

I settled onto another bush to think. And suddenly, I became aware of a 
wonderful odor nearby. I turned my head and saw a beautiful yellow flower. 

Then I remembered something else I’d read. “Pollen,” I said out loud. 
“Bees eat pollen. And they get it from flowers!” 

Excitedly, I flew up into the air and started hovering over the yellow 
blossom. I tried to open my mouth—before I remembered I didn’t have that kind 
of mouth anymore! 

Instead, I had my long, weird tongue. But how was I supposed to use it to 
get the stuff out of the flower? 

I didn’t have a clue! 

As I hummed around in the air, I realized I was becoming more and more 
exhausted. If I didn’t get something to eat soon, I was going to faint. 

I started to feel dizzy. I hardly knew where I was. 

I became more and more confused. My brain got so fuzzy, I even began to 
wonder if I’d ever actually been a boy at all. Maybe I’d really been a bee for my 
entire life, and I’d just dreamed about being a boy. 

Slam! 

Somebody closed a car door nearby, and I was startled out of my mental 
fog. I swiveled my head to look. 

Dad! 

He was closing the garage door. Now he was walking across the driveway 
and heading toward the back door of the house. 

“Dad!” I screamed. “Dad. It’s me. Gary! Help me!” 

“Hi, Gary,” Dad said. 



11 


“Dad! You can hear me!” I cried joyfully. “Dad—you’ve got to help me!” 

My heart sank when Dad walked right past me and started talking to the 
fake Gary. 

Desperately, I started buzzing round and round their heads. 

“Looks like Andretti’s lost one of his workers,” my dad laughed. He 
swatted at me with his rolled-up newspaper. 

A near miss. I darted away. 

“Uh, right,” the fake Gary laughed, pretending he knew what Dad was 
talking about. “Andretti.” 

“Let’s help get dinner on,” my dad said. He put a friendly hand on my 
former shoulder. “Okay, son?” 

“Sure thing, Dad.” 

Like best pals, my dad and his phony son crossed the lawn and opened the 
screen door. 

“Wait!” I shouted. “Wait!” 

Like a space rocket, I shot through the air after them. If I really put the 
speed on, I thought I could make it through the door before it closed. Fast, faster, 
and... 

BLAM! 

The screen door banged shut, right on top of my tiny bee body. Once again, 
I sank into a deep pool of blackness. 

“Ohhhhhh. Where am I? What happened? Am I still a bee?” 

Dazed, I fought my way back to the real world. When I was able to get my 
eyes open, I realized I was still a bee—a small, frail, slightly damaged bee— 
who’d just narrowly missed being scrunched by a screen door. 

Now I was lying on my back on the grass in our yard. My six legs were 
thrashing the air. 

“I was a klutz as a human—and I’m a klutz as a bee!” I wailed. I tried to 
flip myself over. “I’ve only been a bee for an hour, and I’ve almost been killed. 
Twice!” 

I suddenly knew what I had to do. I had to get to Ms. Karmen’s office and 
tell her what had happened. 



I didn’t know if I could do it. But I knew I had to try. 

I let out a small grunt, and with a huge effort, flipped over onto my 
stomach. Using all five of my eyes, I checked myself out. Both sets of wings 
seemed to be working. And all my six legs were still there. 

“Okay,” I told myself. “You can do it. Just fly to the Person-to-Person office 
and go inside.” 

I flapped my wings and started to take off into the air. But I’d only risen 
about an inch up off the ground when I heard a sound that made my blood run 
cold. 

It was Claus the cat. With his long, sharp claws extended, he leaped through 
the air. 

I let out a squeal as he pounced on me, grabbed me in one paw, and began 
to tighten his claws around my body. 



12 


As the cat’s claws closed around me, I saw his hideous mouth gape open. 

Sting him! Sting him! 

The thought burned into my mind. 

But something held me back. Something told me not to use my stinger. 

I suddenly remembered something else I’d read in The Big Book of Bees. 
Honeybees die once they use their stingers! 

No way! I thought. 

I was still hoping to come out of this alive. And back in my old body. 

So, if using my stinger was out, I’d have to use my wits instead. 

With a loud gnashing of his teeth, Claus snapped his huge mouth shut. He 
lowered his head, preparing to snap up his furry prize—me. 

At just the right moment, I burst out of his claws and ducked out from 
under his gnashing teeth. 

I tried to shoot off through the air. But the cat whipped out his paw and 
batted me down. 

Claus was playing with me as if I were one of the chewed-up catnip mouse 
toys Krissy always gives him for Christmas. 

With my last burst of strength, I spread my wings, shot up through the air, 
and flew as fast as I could. A backwards look out of one of my eyes told me that 
I’d left the surprised cat sitting in the grass. 

For one second, I experienced a wonderful sensation of triumph. “You did 
it, Gary!” I crowed to myself. “You, a tiny little bee, managed to fight off a great 
big vicious cat!” 

I was so pleased with myself, I decided to take a little victory lap. I spread 
my wings out wide and began a big, slow circle in the air. 

Whap! 

Oh, no! Now what? 

I’d crashed right into something! But what was it? It wasn’t hard, like a 
wall or a tree. Instead, it was soft and clinging, like cloth. And my feet were all 
tangled up in it. 

I struggled to squirm free. I wiggled and pushed. But my legs were caught. 

I was trapped. 



“Haw haw haw!” 

The booming laughter made my entire body shake. 

I suddenly realized where I was. 

I was caught in Andretti’s net. 

A wave of despair made me slump against the white netting. 
I knew exactly what would happen next. 

He would put me in his hives—and I would never get away. 



13 


“Time to go back home now, my little buzzing babies,” Mr. Andretti sang. “Time 
to get back to work, my honeys.” He started to laugh at his stupid pun. “My 
honeys! Haw haw! Oh, my, wasn’t that a good one?” 

Bzzzzz. Bzzzzzzz. 

From the loud humming sounds in my ears, I knew I wasn’t the only bee 
Andretti had caught in his net. In fact, out of my right eye, I could see another 
bee who looked just like me. He loomed right in front of me, and wiggled his 
antennas in my face. 

Whooa! What a monster! 

My wiry legs began trembling with fright. I twisted myself around and 
around, struggling to get away from him. 

I finally got myself turned the other way. But then I saw I was facing 
another bee. And another. Each one looked scarier than the last. 

They all had big, bulging eyes and creepy antennas! And they all buzzed 
menacingly at me. 

The frightening hum grew louder and louder as Mr. Andretti caught more 
bees in the net. Suddenly, the net began to shake. Up and down, up and down— 
like a violent earthquake—until I couldn’t even think straight! 

As the net shook, I lost my footing and fell into a big, squirming cluster of 
bees at the bottom of the net. 

Whooooa! I stumbled over the pile of wriggling, hairy bees. And as I 
staggered in terror, bees fell on top of me. 

A crawling, buzzing nightmare! 

I’ve never been so terrified. I screamed in my tiny voice. I tried to climb up 
the side of the net, but my feet were stuck under another bee’s body. How I hated 
the feel of his disgusting fuzz! 

In my terror, I knew I had to escape. I had to get away from here. I had to 
get to Ms. Karmen’s office and beg her to help me. 

Then I had the most terrifying thought of all. If I couldn’t escape, I 
suddenly realized, I would remain a bee for the rest of my life! 

As Mr. Andretti carried me and the other bees across his back yard, I started 
buzzing and shivering with panic. How could this have happened to me? I asked 



myself. How could I ever have been so stupid as to try to change bodies with 
somebody else? Why wasn’t I happy with the perfectly good body I’d already 
had? 

Mr. Andretti opened the door to the screened-in area off the side of his 
garage. “We’re back now, my little honeys,” he cooed. 

The net started to shake, and I figured out that Mr. Andretti was slowly 
turning it inside out. One by one, he started plucking us—his prisoners—off the 
side of the mesh cloth and plopping each one back inside his hanging drawer 
hives. 

As Andretti reached for the bees, they started buzzing louder than ever. 
Finally, it was my turn to be plucked out of the net. 

When I saw the ends of Andretti’s grasping fingers reaching for me, I hung 
back, clinging to the net. I suddenly remembered his bragging speech about how 
he never used gloves because his bees “trusted” him. 

I watched his fingers stretch toward me. 

It would be so cool to plunge my stinger into his soft, plump skin, I thought. 

Should I do it? 

Should I sting him? 

Should I? 



14 


I didn’t sting him. 

I really didn’t want to die. 

Sure, things really looked terrible for me right now. But I was still clinging 
to a shred of hope. 

Maybe, somehow, I’d find my way out of this bee prison and back into my 
own body. It didn’t seem very likely. But I was determined to keep on trying. 

“In you go, my fuzzy little friend,” Mr. Andretti said. He opened up one of 
the removable drawerlike parts of his hive and dropped me in. 

“Ohhhh,” I moaned. It was so dark inside the hive. And so confusing. 

Where should I go? What should I do? 

The air was hot and wet. Everywhere I turned, I was surrounded by a 
deafening, droning hum. 

“I—I can’t stand it!” I cried. I could feel myself totally losing it! 

All around me, bees scurried around in the darkness. I stayed where I was, 
too frightened to move. 

I suddenly realized I was still very hungry. If I didn’t get something to eat, I 
knew I’d never be able to find a way out of here! 

I spun around and started trying to explore. 

Out of my left eye, I saw another bee glaring at me. I froze in my tracks. 
Did bees attack each other inside their hives? I wondered. 

I didn’t remember reading anything about that in my bee book. But this bee 
really looked ready for a fight. 

“Please leave me alone,” I begged in my tiny voice. “Please give me a 
break.” 

The bee glared back at me. I’ve never seen such big, angry-looking eyes! 

Slowly, I started backing away from him. “Uh...” I squeaked nervously. 
“I’ve got to be going now. I... um... I have to get to work.” 

The bee bulged his eyes and waved his antennas in a threatening way. I was 
sure he planned to sting me. I turned and flew away as fast as I could. I tried to 
hide. 

I was so frightened, I couldn’t even make myself move. What if I bumped 
into another bee? I couldn’t even stand to think about what might happen if I did. 



I realized I had to move. I had to find something to eat. 

Shaking with fear, I tiptoed out into the open. I took a nervous look around. 

On the far wall, I could see a large cluster of bees, busily building 
something. A honeycomb! 

And where there was a honeycomb, I told myself, there was honey. 

I’ve always hated the sweet, sticky goo. But I knew I had to eat some. Right 
away! 

As quietly as I could, I crept over and joined the bee workers. Out of the 
corner of my eye, I saw them doing really gross things with their mouths. 

First, they used their legs to pick little flakes of waxy-looking stuff off their 
abdomens. Then they crammed the wax into their mouths and started working 
their jaws up and down like little chewing machines. Finally, they spit out the 
wax and used it to build part of the honeycomb they were working on. 

“Yuck!” It looked so disgusting. It made me sick! 

But what choice did I have? I had to eat some honey—even if it was 
covered with bee spit. 

I turned my head and practiced sucking my tongue up and down. Then I 
slurped up a big puddle of honey. 

Amazing! For the first time in my life, I actually liked that stuff. Soon, I 
was sucking it down as if it were chocolate milk. 

After a while, I got quite good with my tongue, which was actually more of 
a bendable tube than a tongue. It was really the perfect tool for guzzling honey. 

If I ever made it back to the outside world, I thought I’d now be pretty good 
at using it for gathering nectar and pollen. Why, I might turn out to be the best 
worker in the whole hive! 

I tried to smile, and then I almost gagged on my honey. 

What was happening to me? 

What was I thinking? I was actually starting to feel like a bee! 

I had to get out of this place. Before it was too late! 

I wanted to start searching for an escape route right away. But I suddenly 
felt so tired. So completely worn out... 

Was it the honey? Or was it the strain of so much fear? 

I could barely keep my eyes open. The droning hum grew louder. 

With a weary sigh, I sank against a clump of hairy bodies. 

I sank into the warm darkness of the hive, surrounded by the steady buzz. 
Breathing the sweet aroma of the honey, I sank beside my furry brothers and 



sisters. 

I’m one of them now, I told myself weakly. I’m not a boy anymore. I’m 
bee. A buzzzzzzzzzing bee. A bee sinking into the warm, dark hive. My home. 
Sinking... sinking... 



15 


I woke up with a start and tried to brush a bee away from my face. It took me a 
few moments to remember. I wasn’t lying in my back yard anymore, trying to 
keep the bees away from me. I was a bee—a bee trapped inside a hive! 

I jumped up, took a step, and immediately came face to face with another 
bee! I couldn’t tell if he was the same one I’d seen the night before. But he 
looked just as angry. His big eyes were bulging with rage. And he was moving 
deliberately toward me. 

As fast as I could, I spun around and flew away. Of course, I had no idea 
where I was going. 

The hive seemed to be made up of a lot of long, dark hallways. All around 
me, groups of bees were building honeycombs. As they worked, they kept up a 
steady buzz. The sound was really driving me off the wall! 

I began searching for a way out. I wandered in and out, in and out 
throughout the dark, sticky honeycombs. 

From time to time, I shot out my tongue and lapped up some honey. I was 
getting a little tired of the sweet stuff. But I knew I had to keep up my strength if 
I wanted to try to break out of the hive. 

As I searched for a way to escape, I noticed that every single bee seemed to 
have an assigned job, either building honeycombs, caring for the babies of the 
queen or whatever. And the little bugs never stopped working! They were “busy 
as bees” from morning till night. 

Darting through the tangled darkness, I began to lose hope. 

There’s no way out, I decided. No way out. 

I sank unhappily to the sticky hive floor. And as I dropped, three large bees 
moved in front of me. 

They buzzed angrily, bumping up against me with their hairy, damp bodies. 
It was easy to tell these bees were angry with me. 

Maybe it was because I wasn’t doing my “job.” But what was my job? How 
could I tell the bees I didn’t know what I was supposed to be doing? 

I tried to slip past them, but they moved to block my path. 

Three tough bees. They made me think of Barry, Marv, and Karl. 

I shrank back as one of them pointed his stinger at me. 



He was getting ready to kill me! And I didn’t even know what I’d done! 

I screamed and whirled around. As fast as my six legs would carry me, I 
darted back down the narrow passageway and turned another corner. 

“Oh!” I bumped hard into another bee. Luckily, he was hurrying off 
somewhere, and barely seemed to notice me. 

I gasped with relief. And then an idea came to me. Where was that bee 
going in such a hurry? Was he taking something somewhere? Could he be going 
to an area I hadn’t searched yet? 

I decided to follow him and find out. I needed to learn everything I could 
about the hive. Maybe, just maybe, it would help me escape. 

I hurried after the bee. I thought I’d find him quickly. But he was already 
long gone. 

I searched in and out among the different honeycombs, but I couldn’t find 
him anywhere. After a while, I gave up. 

Way to go, Lutz the Klutz, I scolded myself. I felt worse than ever. 

I shot out my tongue and slurped up a big helping of honey to keep myself 
going. Then I began my endless searching again. 

“Whoooa!” I stopped when I reached an area that looked familiar. I was 
pretty sure it was the place where Andretti had dropped me when he first put me 
into the hive. 

All at once, a large group of angrily buzzing bees crowded against me. 

“Hey—!” I protested as they shoved me forward. 

They replied with a sharp, rising buzz. 

What were they doing? Were they attacking me? Were they all going to 
sting me at once? 

They had me surrounded. I couldn’t run away. 

But how could I possibly fight off all these bees? I was doomed, I realized. 
Finished. Sighing in defeat, I closed my eyes and started to shake. 

And waited for them to swarm over me. 



16 


I waited to be crushed. 

And waited some more. 

When I opened my eyes, the angry bees had moved to the side of the hive. 
They weren’t paying any attention to me. 

I saw a single bee, standing in the center of the hive floor. He was 
performing a kind of jumping, twisting, hip-hop dance. 

How weird! I thought. The other bees were watching intently, as if this were 
the most interesting thing in the world. 

“Those bees didn’t care about me,” I told myself. “They were trying to get 
me out of the way so this bee could do his dance.” 

I realized I’d wasted a lot of time. I had to keep searching for an escape 
route. 

I tried to push myself away from the group of bees, but the hive floor had 
become too crowded to move. 

The bee danced faster and faster. He moved his body toward the right. All 
the other bees stared intently at him. 

What was going on? 

At that moment, something from my old Big Book of Bees came back to 
me. I remembered that bees send out scouts to find their food. Then the scouts 
“dance” to tell the other bees where to go get it! 

If the scout was reporting on where to get food, it meant he’d just been out 
of the hive. That meant there had to be a way out of this place! 

I was so excited, / almost started dancing! 

But I didn’t have a chance because, suddenly, all the bees in the hive rose 
up like a dark cloud. I spread my wings and flew up with them. 

As I followed, the bees formed a single, orderly line and shot out through a 
tiny hole in a far, upper corner of the hive. 

I buzzed around until I found the end of the line. Then I got ready to escape. 

Would I make it? 

The very last bee in line, I shot out of the tiny hole into open space. For a 
few seconds, I watched the other bees floating away, busily hunting for nectar 
and pollen. 



I knew I looked just like them. The difference was that they would willingly 
return to Andretti’s hive. But I never, ever would. At least, not if I could help it. 

“I’m out!” I cried joyfully in my tiny voice. “I’m out! I’m free!” 

Dazzled by the sudden bright light of the outer world, I flew around and 
around in the beekeeping area. Then I headed for the hole I’d seen in the screen 
when I was still in my own body. 

I knew it was on the wall that faced my family’s yard. But when I flew over 
to it, I stopped and gasped in disappointment. 

The hole had been patched up. Mr. Andretti had fixed it! 

“Oh, no!” I wailed. “I can’t be trapped! I can’the!” 

My heart started thumping crazily. My whole body was vibrating. 

I forced myself to calm down and look around. 

None of the other bees were in the screened-in area anymore. They’d 
already gone outside to collect pollen. And that meant there had to be another 
way out. 

I wasn’t thinking clearly because I was exhausted, worn out from all my 
flying around. I sat down on top of the hive to rest. 

At that instant, the door between the beekeeping area and the garage 
opened. “Good morning, my little bee friend,” Mr. Andretti’s voice boomed. 
“What are you doing, lying around on top of the hive? Why aren’t you busy 
inside making me some honey? Are you sick? You know we can’t have any sick 
bees around here.” 

As I gazed up weakly, Mr. Andretti moved closer. His huge, dark shadow 
fell over me. 

I tried to curl up into a ball and disappear. But it was no use. His large 
fingers were stretching right toward me! 

I yelled in terror. But of course, he couldn’t hear me. What is he going to do 
to me? I asked myself. What does he do with sick bees? 



17 


What does he do with sick bees? I wondered again, quivering in terror. 

He probably throws them in the garbage, I thought. Or even worse—he 
feeds them to his pet bird or frog. 

Despite my weariness, I knew I couldn’t wait around to find out. I had to 
get out of there! 

Just as Mr. Andretti’s fingers were about to fold around me, I shot up into 
the air and buzzed around his head. At the same instant, I saw some other bees 
flying in through a tiny hole in the screen. It was in the corner, near the ceiling. 

I buzzed Mr. Andretti’s face one more time. Then I raced toward the hole. 
As I tried to squeeze myself out the exit hole, I crashed right into another bee 
who was flying in. He glared at me and gave me an angry buzz. 

Frightened, I backed off and clung to the screen. I had to wait for a long 
fine of bees to come back inside. It seemed to take them forever. 

When I was finally sure the last bee had come in, I leaped forward and shot 
out of the hole. I was out in the open sky! 

“This time I really am free!” I screamed in celebration, forgetting my 
weariness. “And Andretti’s never going to catch this bee again!” 

I landed on a leaf and let the morning sun warm my back and wings. It was 
a beautiful day—a beautiful day for finding somebody who could help me get 
back into my human body! 

Like a rocket, I shot straight up into the air and gazed around. I recognized 
the familiar creak of my father opening the back door of my house. 

Panting hard, I raced forward. 

My father called, “Good-bye, hon! Tell the kids I’ll see them tonight!” over 
his shoulder and let go of the door. 

I darted into the house. The door slammed hard. Another near miss. 

I hummed with happiness. It felt so good to be back in my own house and 
out of that dark, sticky hive! I landed on the counter and gazed around at the old, 
familiar walls. 

Why hadn’t I ever realized how nice my house was before? 

Step, step, step. 

Someone was coming into the kitchen! I flew up onto the windowsill for a 



better look. 

Krissy! 

Maybe I could get her to listen to me. 

“Krissy! Krissy!” I buzzed. “Over here by the window. It’s me, Gary!” 

To my delight, she turned and stared in my direction. 

“Yes!” I cried excitedly. “Yes—it’s me! It’s me!” 

“Oh, terrific,” Krissy groaned. “One of Andretti’s dumb bees got in here 
again.” 

Okay, so it wasn’t exactly the reaction I’d been hoping for. But she’d still 
noticed me! Maybe, I thought, if I flew right onto her shoulder and spoke into 
her ear, she’d be able to understand me! 

My heart vibrating my entire body, I lifted myself up off the windowsill and 
soared toward my sister. “Krissy!” I buzzed as I approached her shoulder. “You 
have to listen to me!” 

“Aaaaiii!” 

Krissy screeched so loud, I was afraid the glass in the windows would 
shatter. “Get away from me, bee!” 

She started thrashing her hands in the air, trying to bat me away. 

“Ow!” I cried out as she slapped me. Stung with pain, I lost control and 
landed with a thud on the tiled countertop. 

I raised my eyes in time to see Krissy grab a flyswatter from out of the 
broom closet. 

“No, Krissy, no!” I screamed. “Not that! You don’t want to do that to your 
own brother!” 

My sister lifted up the flyswatter and thwacked it down right next to me. I 
could feel the rush of air from it. And I felt the entire counter shake. 

I screamed and quickly rolled to one side. 

Krissy, I knew, was a menace with a flyswatter. 

She was the champion in our family. She never missed. 

The eyes on top of my head spun in terror. And in the gray blur, I could see 
the shape of the flyswatter, rising up to slap me again. And again. 



18 


“Stop, Krissy!” I screamed. “Stop! You’re squashing me!” 

With a strangled gasp, I toppled off the counter. I hit the floor hard and 
struggled dizzily to my feet. 

Now I started to get angry. Why did Krissy have to be so bloodthirsty? 
Couldn’t she just open a window and shoo me out? 

Buzzing weakly, I floated up off the floor. Regaining my strength, I began 
darting wildly around the room, crashing into the walls and cupboards to show 
Krissy how upset I was. Then I shot out of the kitchen. 

In a rage, I headed up the stairs to my room. If my sister wouldn’t help me, 
I’d get someone else to help. Namely, the new Gary! 

The morning sun was high in the sky. But “Gary” was still sound asleep in 
my bed. 

Seeing him lying there so peacefully, so completely at home, made me even 
angrier. 

“Wake up, you slug!” I buzzed at him. He didn’t move. His mouth hung 
open as he slept, making him look like a real jerk. 

“Yuck! What a creep!” I was sure my mouth never hung open when I slept! 

I decided to take action. I landed on “Gary’s” head and started walking 
around on his face. I was sure my little insect legs would tickle him and wake 
him up. 

Nothing. He didn’t move. 

Even when I stuck a leg up his nose, “Gary” slept without stirring. 

“Why is he so wrecked?” I wondered. “Has he been wearing out my body?” 

Furious, I ran across “Gary’s” face and climbed down through his hair. 
Then I crawled onto his ear. “BUZZ!” I shouted as loudly as I could. “BUZZ! 
BUZZ! BUZZ!” 

Incredible as it seems, the new “Gary” didn’t even budge. 

Just my luck. Dirk Davis was turning out to be the world’s soundest 
sleeper! 

I sighed and gave up. I crawled off “Gary’s” ear and flew around my old 
room, gazing down at my bed, my dresser, and my computer. 

“My computer!” I cried excitedly. “Maybe I can put a message on the 



screen! Maybe I can tell my parents what has happened to me!” 

I swooped down to the computer, buzzing eagerly. 

Yes! The computer had been left on. 

What luck! I knew I wasn’t heavy enough to push the Power button. 

Would I be strong enough to type? 

A clear blue screen greeted me on the monitor. My heart pounding, I 
lowered myself to the keyboard and started hopping around on the letters. 

Yes! I was heavy enough to make the keys go up and down. 

I paused, resting on the Enter key. 

What should I type? What message should I put on the screen? 

What? What? What? 

As I frantically thought, I heard “Gary” stir behind me on the bed. He let 
out a groan. He was waking up. 

Quick! I told myself. Type something! Type anything! 

He’ll see it as soon as he gets out of bed. 

I hopped over to the letters and began to jump up and down, spelling out 
my desperate message. 

It was hard work. My bee eyes weren’t made for reading letters. And I kept 
leaping up and falling in the cracks between the keys. 

After eight or nine jumps, I was gasping for air. 

But I finished my message just as “Gary” sat up in bed and stretched. 
Floating up in front of the monitor, I struggled to read what I had typed: 

I AM NOT BEE. I AM GARY. HELO ME. 

Through my blurred vision, I saw that I missed the P in HELP and hit the O 
instead. I wanted to go back and fix it. But I was totally wiped out. I could barely 
buzz. 

Would they understand? 

Would they read the message and see me standing on top of the monitor and 
understand? 

“Gary” would understand. I knew he would. Dirk Davis would figure it out. 
I climbed wearily to the top of the monitor and watched him climb out of 

bed. 

Here he comes, I saw eagerly. He brushed his hair out of his eyes. He 
yawned. He stretched again. 



Over here! I urged. 

Dirk — please—check out the computer monitor! 

Dirk—over here! 

He picked up a crumpled pair of jeans off the floor and pulled them on. 
Then he found a wrinkled T-shirt to go with it. 

Come on, Dirk! I pleaded, hopping up and down on top of the monitor. 
Read the screen—please ? 



19 


Would he read it? 

Yes! Rubbing his eyes, “Gary” shuffled over to the computer. 

Yes! Yes! 

I nearly burst for joy as I watched him squint at the screen. “Go ahead, 
Gary! Read it! Read it!” I squeaked. 

He squinted at the screen some more, frowning. “Did I leave that thing on 
overnight?” he muttered, shaking his head. “Wow. I must be losing it.” 

He reached down and clicked off the power. Then he turned and made his 
way out of the room. 

Stunned, I toppled off the monitor, landing hard on the desk beside the 
keyboard. All that work for nothing. 

What was “Gary’s” problem, anyway? Doesn’t he know how to read? 

I’ve got to talk to him, I told myself, pulling myself together. I’ve got to 
communicate with him somehow. 

I lifted my wings and floated up after him. I followed him through the 
kitchen, and then slipped through the back door with him. 

As he strode across the grass, I started buzzing around his head. But he 
didn’t pay any attention to me. 

He crossed the yard and opened our garage door. Then he went inside and 
brought out my old skateboard. 

I hadn’t used that skateboard in at least two years. My uncle had given it to 
me for my tenth birthday, and I almost broke my leg trying to ride it. After that, I 
put it away and refused to touch it again. 

“Don’t get on that thing!” I yelled at “Gary”. “It’s dangerous. You might 
hurt my body. And I want it back in one piece!” 

Of course “Gary” didn’t even notice me. Instead, he carried the skateboard 
out in front of the house and put it down on the ground. 

A short while later, Kaitlyn and Judy walked up the sidewalk. I waited for 
them to start giggling and making fun of the new me. 

“Hi, Gary,” Kaitlyn said. She brushed some curly hair off her forehead and 
smiled. “Are we late for our skateboarding lesson?” 

“Gary” flashed her a big smile. “No way, Kaitlyn,” he answered in my 



voice. “Want to head over to the playground like we did yesterday?” 

I couldn’t believe my ears. Skateboarding lesson? Head over to the 
playground like we did yesterday? What was going on around here? 

“I hope you don’t mind, Gary,” Judy said. “We told some of the other kids 
—like Gail and Louie—how good you are. They all said they can’t wait to take a 
lesson from you, too. Is that okay? Because if it isn’t, we can call them, and—” 

“No problem, Jude,” “Gary” broke in. “Let’s get going, okay?” The new 
“me” hopped onto his skateboard and smoothly rolled his way down the 
sidewalk. Judy and Kaitlyn hurried after him. 

For a second, I was too shocked to move. But then I decided to follow 
them. 

As I swooped after them, I kept muttering to myself, “I can’t believe it! 
Lutz the Klutz is giving skateboard lessons at the playground? Everybody’s 
waiting for him to show up? What is going on?” 

A few minutes later, the four of us had reached the playground. Sure 
enough, a whole gang of kids was waiting there for “Gary”. He put down his 
skateboard and started giving everybody pointers on “boarding”, as he called it. 

I buzzed over to him and started shouting in his ear again. “Dirk!” I 
shouted. “Dirk Davis! It’s me. The real Gary Lutz!” 

Very casually, he swatted me away. 

I tried to speak to him again. This time he swatted me really hard, sending 
me spinning to the ground. 

Trying to shake off the pain, I gave up. Dirk isn’t going to help me, I 
realized. 

Ms. Karmen is my only hope. After all, she was the one with all the 
equipment. She was the only person who could reverse what she had done. 

I flew onto a tree and tried to figure out which way to fly. When you’re an 
insect, everything looks different to you. Things that seem small to a person 
appear huge to a bee. So I wanted to be sure I didn’t get myself mixed up and fly 
off in the wrong direction. 

Standing on a big leaf, I gazed up and down the block until I was sure I 
knew which way to go. As I got ready to take off, a large shadow suddenly 
loomed over my head. At first, I thought it was a small bird. But then I realized it 
was a dragonfly. 

“Stay calm,” I told myself. “A dragonfly is an insect, isn’t it? And insects 
don’t eat each other, right?” 



I guess no one had told the dragonfly. 

Before I could move, it zoomed down, wrapped its teeth around my middle, 
and bit me in two. 



20 


I uttered a last gasp and waited for everything to go dark. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that the dragonfly had turned and 
buzzed off in the other direction. 

My imagination was running away with me. That’s what always happened 
when I got overtired. 

I took a deep breath, grateful to still be in one piece. I decided I had to use 
my remaining strength to get to Ms. Karmen at the Person-to-Person Vacations 
office. 

I rose up into the air, looked both ways for oncoming dragonfly traffic, then 
fluttered away. 

After a long, tiring trip, I floated past a street sign that told me I’d made it 
to the right block. Roach Street. 

I buzzed along the sidewalk until I came to the Person-to-Person building. 
Then I sat down on the stoop and tried to figure out how I was going to get 
inside. 

Luckily, as I rested on the warm cement, I saw a mailman marching up the 
street, stopping at each house along his route. Quickly, I flew over to the Person- 
to-Person entrance and checked it out. Just as I’d hoped, there was a mail slot in 
the middle of the door. 

I buzzed over to the doorknob, and waited for my chance. Slowly, the 
mailman trudged up to the building. 

“Hurry up!” I screamed at him. “Do you think I have all day here?” Of 
course he couldn’t hear me. 

He fumbled around in his bag and pulled out a bundle of letters. Then, 
slowly, he reached out and pushed open the mail slot. 

Before the mailman had a chance to react, I swooped down in front of his 
nose and buzzed right through the mail slot. As I zipped along, I heard him gasp, 
and I knew he’d seen me. But for once, luck was with me. I moved so quickly, 
there hadn’t been any time for the mailman to try to swat me. 

My luck held when I flew up the stairs. 

I’d just reached the top when the door to Person-to-Person Vacations 
opened, and a girl about my age came out. She had long, curly red hair and had a 



serious, thoughtful expression on her face. Was she thinking of trading places 
with someone? 

“Go home!” I shouted at her. “And don’t come back. Stay away from this 
place! Just look what happened to me!” 

Even though I was screaming, the girl didn’t even turn her head. But she 
left the door open just long enough for me to buzz into the Person-to-Person 
office. 

I flew across the waiting room and saw Ms. Karmen, sitting in the same 
chair she’d been in when I first met her. 

I shot right toward her—and smacked into something hard. 

Pain roared through my body. I dropped to the floor, dizzy and confused. 

As my head began to clear, I remembered the glass wall separating Ms. 
Karmen from the waiting area. Like some kind of brainless June bug, I’d crashed 
right into it! 

I shook myself to clear my mind. “Ms. Karmen!” I yelled. “Ms. Karmen. 
It’s me—Gary Lutz. Look what happened! Can you help me? Can you?” 



21 


Ms. Karmen didn’t even glance up from her paperwork. Once again, I realized 
no one could hear my squeaky insect voice. 

With a defeated moan, I sank down onto the seat of the chair and curled up 
into a tiny ball. I’d come all this way for nothing, I realized. I’d found the one 
person in the world who might be able to help me. And she couldn’t even hear 
me! 

“I give up,” I whispered sadly. “It’s hopeless. I have to get used to the idea 
of being a bee forever! There’s no way I’ll ever get my old body back.” 

I had never been so miserable in all my life. I wished someone would come 
along, drop into the chair, and sit on me! 

A strange sound startled me from my unhappy thoughts. I sat up straight 
and listened hard. 

“Whoo-ah. Whoo-ah. ” It almost sounded like someone breathing. But how 
could that be? It was so loud! 

I floated up off the chair and buzzed around the room, trying to find out 
where the sound was coming from. I had circled the room twice before I figured 
it out. 

Ms. Karmen was bending over to pick up something she’d dropped on the 
floor. Her nose and mouth were only inches from the top of her desk. And the 
microphone she used to talk to people had picked up the sounds of her breathing! 

Suddenly, I had a brilliant idea. If I could get to the other side of the glass, I 
could use the microphone to make Ms. Karmen hear me. 

I swooped over to the wall and flew straight up to the ceiling. No luck 
there. The sheet of glass went all the way up. There was no space for me to 
wedge myself through to the other side. 

I buzzed down to the place where the glass met the top of Ms. Karmen’s 
desk. Yes! There was a small slot in the glass. I remembered how she had passed 
through the book of photographs on my first visit to the office. 

The slot wasn’t very large. But it was plenty big enough for my round little 
bee body. 

I shot through the hole and jumped up on top of the microphone. 

“Ms. Karmen!” I shouted, putting my mouth next to the hard metal. “Ms. 



Karmen!” 

Her eyes opened wide. Her mouth dropped open in confusion. She stared 
out into the waiting room, searching for the person speaking. 

“It’s Gary Lutz!” I called out. “And I’m down here on your microphone.” 

Ms. Karmen stared down at the microphone. Then her eyes narrowed in 
fear. “What’s going on? Who’s doing this? Is this a joke?” 

“No!” I cried. “It’s no joke at all. It’s really me—Gary Lutz!” 

“But—but—” she stammered, but no other words came out. “What’s the 
joke? How are you doing that?” 

Her voice was so loud, the sound waves nearly blasted me off the 
microphone. 

“You don’t have to yell!” I cried. “I can hear you.” 

“I don’t believe this!” she exclaimed in a trembling voice. She stared down 
at me. 

“It’s all your fault!” I shouted angrily. “You messed up the transfer 
operation. When you made the switch, one of my neighbor’s bees must have 
gotten into the machine. So, instead of putting me into Dirk Davis’ body, you put 
me into a bee! ” 

Ms. Karmen blinked. Then she slapped her forehead. “Well that explains 
it!” she cried. “That explains why Dirk Davis’ body has been behaving so 
strangely.” 

She picked up some papers on her desk and started putting them into her 
briefcase. “I really must apologize,” she said. “I feel really bad, Gary. We’ve 
never had a mix-up like this before. I hope... I hope it’s at least been interesting 
for you.” 

“Interesting?” I shrieked. “It’s been a nightmare! You wouldn’t believe 
what I’ve been through. I’ve been attacked by screen doors, cats, flyswatters— 
you name it! You yourself almost ran me over with your car!” 

All the color drained from her face. “Oh, no,” she cried, her voice a 
whisper. “I’m so sorry. I—I didn’t know.” 

“Well, what about it?” I asked her impatiently. 

“What about what?” 

“What about getting me back into my body! Can you do it right away?” 

Ms. Karmen cleared her throat. “Well, I could,” she replied slowly. 
“Normally, I could transfer you right back. But there’s a slight problem in your 
case.” 



“What kind of problem?” I demanded. 

“It’s Dirk Davis,” Ms. Karmen replied. “It seems he’s become very attached 
to your old body. He likes your house and your parents, too. In fact, he even 
likes your sister, Krissy!” 

“So?” I cried. “So what’s that supposed to mean?” 

Ms. Karmen stood up and pushed in her desk chair. “It means,” she said, 
“that Dirk Davis is refusing to give up your old body. He says he absolutely 
won’t go back to his old life. He plans to keep your body forever.” 



22 


“WHAT?” I screamed, hopping up and down angrily on the microphone. 

“Just what I said,” Ms. Karmen said. “Dirk Davis wants to keep your body 
for the rest of his life.” 

“But he can’t do that, can he?” 

“It is very upsetting,” she replied, biting her lower lip. “It wasn’t what he 
said in our original agreement. But if he refuses to get out of your body and your 
life, there’s really nothing I can do.” 

Ms. Karmen gazed down at me sympathetically. “I’m so sorry about this, 
Gary,” she said softly. “I guess I’ll have to be more careful in the future.” 

“What about my future? What am I supposed to do now?” I wailed. 

Ms. Karmen shrugged. “I don’t know. Maybe you could go back, wait in 
the hive—and maybe Dirk Davis will change his mind.” 

“Back to the hive?!” My antennas stood straight on end, quivering with 
rage. “Do you have any idea what it’s like in there? Cramped together with those 
hairy bees in the darkness? Listening to that deafening buzz day and night?” 

“It’s a way of staying alive,” Ms. Karmen replied bluntly. 

“I—I don’t care!” I stammered. “I’m never going back there! Never!” 

“This is tragic. Tragic!” Ms. Karmen cried. “I’ll give your case some 
thought tonight, Gary. I promise. Maybe I can come up with a way of getting 
your body away from Dirk.” 

She crossed the room and opened the office door. “I’m so upset. So upset,” 
she murmured. Then she disappeared out the door, slamming it behind her. 

Trembling with anger at Dirk Davis, I hopped down to the desk. “Hey, 
wait!” I called after her. “You’ve locked me in!” 

Ms. Karmen was so upset, she forgot about me! 

I rose up into the air and started after her. But, then, I happened to glance 
back down at her desk. Dirk Davis’ questionnaire was right on top of a pile of 
papers. His address was next to his name. He lived at 203 Eastwood Avenue. 

Eastwood Avenue was near the computer store, so I knew where it was. 
“Maybe the old Dirk Davis will know how to get my body back!” I told myself. 

It was worth a try. I ducked through the slot in the glass and flew around the 
waiting room. 



No exit. No open window. No crack in the door. 

Once again, I was trapped. 

Frantically, I buzzed all around the waiting room. Then I went back through 
the slot in the glass. I checked out the whole equipment room. Every window 
was closed tight. 

I flew past a calendar and happened to see the date. “Oh, no!” I cried. “It’s 
Friday! It’s the weekend. Ms. Karmen might not come back to work for two 
whole days.” 

In two days, I realized, I would starve to death! 

I had to get out! I went over to the far wall and noticed another door I 
hadn’t seen before. I zipped through it. 

The room turned out to be a tiny bathroom. With one small window. Which 
was open just a crack. It was all I needed. 

“Hurray!” I yelled. I shot out through the window and sailed into the open 
air. Then I turned right and headed for Eastwood Avenue. Luckily, it wasn’t very 
far away. All this flying around was really beginning to wear me out. 

I found Dirk Davis’ house without any trouble. When I got there, I saw 
“Dirk” himself—or whoever he was now—standing in the front yard. I 
recognized him from the picture I’d seen in the Person-to-Person album. 

“Hey!” I yelled to him. “Hey, er... Dirk!” 

The tall, good-looking boy turned around and stared at me. His mouth 
moved, and it looked as if he was saying something. 

But I couldn’t understand any words. All I heard was a humming sound. 

“I’m Gary Lutz!” I cried in my little voice. “Can you help me get Dirk 
Davis out of my body?” 

The boy stared at me. Then he grinned. 

I was confused. What was he grinning about? 

“Hey, you can hear me! ” I cried. 

Now “Dirk” motioned with his hand. 

“You want me to follow you?” I asked. I felt excited. “Are you taking me 
someplace where we can get help?” 

“Dirk” grinned again. Then he turned and walked around the corner of the 
house. I didn’t know where we were going. But I knew I had to follow him. 

I found “Dirk” in the back yard. “Hum,” he said to me. “Hum.” He pointed 
to a big rosebush and grinned. Then he stuck his nose deep inside one of the 
blossoms. “Hummmmmmmmm,” he said. “Yummmmmm.” 



I gaped at him in shock. “Of course!” I cried. 

“You got the bee’s mind when I got the bee’s body!” 

“Dirk” didn’t say anything. But when he pulled his face out of the rose, the 
end of his nose was covered with yellow pollen. 

“Dirk” looked a little surprised. And disappointed. I guess he missed his 
long, sucking tongue—the tongue that was now hanging off the front of my face. 

“You can’t help me,” I muttered to him. “You’re in worse shape than I am!” 

“Hum?” he replied. “Hum?” 

He looked kind of silly with that yellow nose. But I felt sorry for him. He 
and I had the wrong brains in the wrong bodies. I knew exactly how he felt. 

“I’m going to go get help for both of us,” I told him. “If I get my body 
back, maybe you’ll get yours, too.” 

With a loud buzz, I flew out of the Davises’ yard. As I left, I thought I heard 
“Dirk” buzz back at me. I glanced over my wing and saw him sticking his face 
into another rose. Maybe this time he’d have better luck getting the pollen out. 

I headed toward my own house. This time I planned to make Dirk Davis 
give me my body back. Or else. 

As I turned up my street, I suddenly heard a familiar voice coming from 
behind a tree. 

“Don’t mess with me! Don’t mess with me, man!” 

I couldn’t believe it. The voice belonged to Marv. But who was he talking 
to? 

I shot around the tree to find out. To my surprise, I saw that Marv was 
talking to me—or, Dirk Davis, in my body. Barry and Karl were right beside 
him. 

Look out, Dirk! I thought. Run! Run! 

Please don’t let them wreck my body! 

But I was too late. 

Barry, Marv, and Karl were closing in on him, about to give him the 
pounding of his life. 



23 


I flew closer. 

“Look out, Dirk! Look out!” I squeaked. 

But to my surprise, the three hulking creeps weren’t moving in on “Gary”— 
they were backing away from him! 

“Don’t mess with me!” Marv cried. “I said I was sorry.” 

“We apologized,” Barry whined. “Don’t hit us again, Gary! Please!” 

Karl whimpered behind him, nursing a bloody nose. 

“You guys are losers,” I heard “Gary” tell them. “Take a hike. Go get a 

life.” 

“Okay! Okay!” Marv cried. “Just no more rough stuff, okay, Gary?” 

“Gary” shook his head and walked away. 

I don’t believe this! I thought gleefully. Barry, Marv, and Karl were afraid 
of me! 

I decided I’d have some fun with them, too. 

I swooped down and landed on Barry’s nose, buzzing as loudly and 
menacingly as I could. 

“Yowwwww!” he shrieked in surprise—and swatted himself on the nose. 

I was too fast for him. I was already on Karl’s ear. 

Karl cried out and toppled backwards into a thorny rosebush. 

Then I buzzed round and around Marv. 

“Get away!” he shouted angrily. 

And I flew right into his mouth. 

His scream nearly deafened me. But it was worth it. 

Marv started spitting and choking and gagging. 

I flew up into the air, laughing so hard, I nearly popped my antennas. That 
was the most fun I’d had since becoming a bee! 

I watched the three gorillas run away. Then I flew up the block to my house. 

“Gary” had left the window open, and I was able to shoot in. He was lying 
on my bed, reading one of my comic books and eating crackers with honey on 
them. 

The honey smelled really good, and I realized I was hungry again. I 



reminded myself to stop by a flower and get a snack the next time I went 
outside. 

But, meanwhile, I had work to do. I flew over and landed on Gary’s 
earlobe. 

“Hey, you! Dirk Davis!” I yelled at the top of my little voice. “I need to talk 
to you!” 

He reached a hand up and flicked me off his face. I fell down and landed 
with a bounce on the bed. 

I buzzed angrily and shot right back up to his earlobe. “Hey, you! I want my 
body back! You have to get out of it. Now!” 

“Gary” folded up his comic book and swung it at me. I buzzed with rage 
and frustration. I wasn’t going to give up this time. No way! I had to make him 
hear me. 

I rocketed up in the air and landed on the top of his head. Then I climbed 
down to his other earlobe and tried one more time. “I’m not leaving you alone 
till you get out of my body!” I screeched. “Do you hear me?” 

He sighed and shrugged his shoulders. “Will you please quit bothering 
me?” he asked. “Can’t you see I’m trying to relax?” 

“You can hear me?” 

“Yeah. Sure,” he muttered. “I can hear you okay.” 

“You can?” I was so surprised, I almost fell off his ear. 

“Yes, I can hear you perfectly. Weird, huh? I’m not sure why. But I think 
some bee cells got mixed up with my human cells during our electronic transfer. 
I can hear all kinds of little bug noises now.” 

“Your human cells? Those are my human cells!” I cried. 

Dirk shrugged. 

“Enough chitchat,” I told him. “When do you plan to get out of my body?” 

“Never,” he replied. He picked up his comic book and started reading it 
again. “I like your body. I can’t understand why you gave it up to go become a 
bee.” 

“That wasn’t my idea!” I screamed. 

“You’ve got a good life here,” he continued. “I mean, you have great 
parents. Krissy is an okay sister. And Claus is an awesome cat. Too bad you 
didn’t know all that when you were in your body. Which is now my body!” 

“It’s not your body! It’s mine! Give it back!” I started to buzz furiously all 
around his head, swooping down in front of his nose, crashing into his ears, 



batting my wings in his eyes. 

Dirk Davis didn’t even flinch. 

“What’s the matter with you, anyway?” I yelled. “You’re me now. You’re 
supposed to be scared of bees!” 

“Gary” laughed. “You’ve forgotten something,” he said. “I’m not you. I’m 
just inside your body. I’m still me inside. And I’m not the least bit afraid of 
bees!” 

“And, now,” he went on, “take a hike, okay? Buzz off. I’m busy.” 

Frozen with anger and disappointment, I slumped on the bedspread without 
moving. “Gary” raised the comic book up into the air. “I’d hate to swat you,” he 
said. “But I will if I have to!” 

I dodged away just as the comic book slapped down on the bedspread. Then 
I shot back out the window. 

For a few minutes, I flew aimlessly around, lost in my sad thoughts. Finally, 
I remembered how hungry I was. I perched on top of a big, orange lily blossom 
and started sucking up some nectar. 

Not bad, I told myself as I drank. But honey on crackers would be much 
better. 

“What am I supposed to do now?” I asked myself. “Am I really doomed to 
be a bee for the rest of my life?” I pulled my head out of the orange blossom and 
looked around. “And how long is the rest of my life anyway?” 

I remembered a page from The Big Book of Bees. 

“The life of the average bee is not very long. While the queen can live 
through as many as five winters, the workers and drones die off in the fall.” 

In the fall? 

It was already nearly August! 

If I stayed in this bee body, I had only a month or two at most! 

I gazed sadly up at my house. “Gary” had turned the light on in my room, 
and it twinkled in the early evening dusk. 

How I wished I could be up there! Why, why had I ever been stupid enough 
to think I’d be better off in someone else’s body? 

Then I heard a buzz. I peered over the blossom. Sure enough, I saw a bee. 

He hopped up onto the flower. Two other bees quickly joined him. Then 
three more. They buzzed angrily. 

“Go away!” I cried. 

I tried to fly away. 



But before I could lift off, they all swarmed over me. 

I couldn’t move. The bees had taken me prisoner. 

“Don’t take me back to the hive!” I shrieked. “Don’t take me back!” 
But to my horror, they started to drag me away. 



24 


I struggled to squirm away. But they turned their stingers on me. 

Were they some kind of bee police? Did they think I was trying to escape 
the hive? 

I didn’t have a chance to discuss it with them. They lifted me up into the air. 
There were bees in front of me, bees behind, and bees on all sides. 

We flew past my bedroom window. “Help!” I called. 

“Gary” glanced up from his plate of crackers and honey. He smiled and 
waved at me. 

I was so angry, I thought I might explode. 

But then an idea came to me. A crazy idea. A desperate idea. 

I buzzed as loudly as I could. Then I darted out of line and shot into the 
open bedroom window. 

Were the others following me? Were they? 

Yes! 

They didn’t want to let me escape. 

“Gary” sat up when he saw me and my buzzing followers. He rolled up his 
comic book, preparing to swat us. 

I circled the room, and the other bees followed. 

“Get out! Get out!” “Gary” screamed. 

There weren’t enough of us, I decided. I needed a huge swarm. 

I flew back out the window. The others buzzed after me. 

Now I was the head bee. As fast as I could, I led my group back to Mr. 
Andretti’s garage, and in through the hole in the screen. 

I hesitated at the hive entrance. I took a deep breath. 

Was I really going to go back inside? 

I knew I had no choice. “Go for it, Lutz!” I shouted to myself. 

I shot in through the entrance hole. 

Then I began flying crazily through the hive, buzzing angrily, bumping the 
walls, bumping other bees. 

The hive stirred to life. 

The buzzing grew to a dull roar. Then a loud roar. Then a deafening roar! 



Round and round I raged, flying faster, faster, throwing myself frantically 
against the sticky hive walls, tumbling, darting, buzzing furiously. 

The entire hive was in an uproar now. 

I had turned the bees into an angry swarm. 

Out of the hive I flew. Out into the darkening evening. Out through the hole 
in the screen, up, up, and away. 

And the bees swarmed after me, like a black cloud against the gray-blue 

sky. 

Up we soared. Up, up. 

A buzzing, swarming funnel cloud. 

Up, up. 

I led them up to the bedroom window. 

Tumbling over each other, raging through the air, we swarmed into 
“Gary’s” room. 

“Huh?” He jumped off the bed. 

He didn’t have time to say a word. 

I landed in his hair. The raging swarm followed, buzzing angrily, 
surrounding him, covering his head, his face, his shoulders. 

“H-help!” His weak cry was drowned out by the roar of the bees. “Help 

me!” 

I dropped down onto the tip of Gary’s nose. “Have you had enough?” I 
demanded. “Are you ready to give me back my body?” 

“Never!” he cried. “I don’t care what you do to me! You’ll never get your 
body back! It’s mine, and I’m keeping it forever!” 

Whoooa! I could not believe my ears. 

I mean, he was covered in bees! And still he wouldn’t listen to reason! 

I didn’t know what to do. 

The other bees were starting to lose interest. 

Some of them drifted to the plate of honey. Most of them floated back out 
the open window. 

“You can’t get away with this, Dirk!” I screamed. 

With a furious wail, I whirled around. Then I stabbed my razor-sharp 
stinger deep into the side of “Gary’s” nose. 

“Owwwwwww!” He let out a high-pitched shriek and grabbed at his nose. 
Then he staggered backwards and fell over onto the bed. 

“Yaaaaay!” I cried out in celebration. 



For one instant, I felt triumphant. 

A tiny bee had defeated a huge enemy! I was victorious! I had won a fight 
against a giant! 

My celebration didn’t last very long. 

I suddenly realized what I had done. And I remembered what happens to a 
honeybee after it stings someone. 

“I’m going to die,” I murmured weakly. “I stung someone, and now I’m 
going to die!” 



25 


Weaker. 

I felt the strength drain from me. 

Weaker and weaker. 

“What have I done?” I asked myself. “I gave up my life for the chance to 
sting Dirk Davis! Why was I such a jerk?” 

I struggled to keep my wings moving, struggled to stay in the air. 

I knew I was doomed. But I wanted to stay alive as long as I could. Maybe, 
I thought, as I felt my strength fading, maybe I’ll have a chance to tell my family 
good-bye. 

“Mom! Dad! Krissy!” I buzzed faintly. “Where are you?” 

It was hard to breathe. I felt so tired, so weak. 

I floated out the window and sank to the grass below. 

I thought I recognized the shape of the old maple tree where I used to read 
books and spy on Mr. Andretti. But my sight was so bad, it was hard to be sure 
about anything. The whole world swirled in gray shadow. 

I could no longer hold up my head. The gray shadows grew darker and 
darker. 

Until the world faded completely from view. 

I sat up slowly. The ground spun beneath me. 

Where was I? 

My back yard? 

I blinked, struggling to bring it all into focus, waiting for my eyes to clear. 

“There’s the old maple tree!” I cried. “And there’s my house! And there’s 
Mr. Andretti’s house!” 

Was I alive? 

Was I really alive, sitting in my back yard, seeing all the familiar places? 

Did I have my strength back? 

I decided to test it. I tried to spread my wings and fly up into the air. 

But for some reason, my wings didn’t seem to be working. My body felt 
heavy and strange. 



I frowned and looked down, inspecting myself to see what was wrong. 
“Whoooa!” I cried out in surprise. Instead of six legs, I saw two arms and two 
legs and my skinny old body. 

Breathlessly, I reached up to touch my face. My extra eyes were gone—and 
so were my antennas, and my layer of feathery fuzz. Instead, I felt hair! And 
smooth, human skin! 

I jumped up and shouted for joy. “I’m a person again! I’m me! I’m me!” 

I threw my arms around my chest and gave myself a hug. Then I danced 
around the back yard, testing my arms and legs. 

They worked! They all worked! 

I couldn’t get over how wonderful it was to be human again! 

“But how did it happen?” I asked myself. “What happened to Dirk Davis?” 

For a chilling instant, I wondered if Dirk had been forced into a bee’s body 
the way I had. 

Probably not, I decided. 

But what had happened? 

How did I get my body back? 

Was it the bee sting? Did the shock of the sting send us all back to the 
bodies we belonged in? 

“I’ve got to call Ms. Karmen and find out!” I realized. 

But for now, all I wanted to do was see my family. 

I hurried up the back steps and into the house. As I ran through the kitchen, 
I crashed right into Krissy. As usual, she was carrying Claus under one arm. 

“Watch where you’re going!” Krissy snapped at me. 

She probably expected me to snap back at her and try to push her out of my 
way. But instead I grabbed her shoulders and gave her a big hug. Then I planted 
a kiss on her cheek. 

“Yuck! Gross!” she cried and wiped the cheek with her hand. 

I laughed happily. 

“Don’t give me your cooties, creep!” Krissy cried. 

“You’re a creep!” I replied. 

“No, you’re a creep!” she repeated. 

“You’re a jerk!” I shouted. 

It felt so good to be calling her names again! 

I gleefully called her a few more things. Then I hurried upstairs to see my 
parents. 



I met them as they were coming out of my room. 

“Mom! Dad!” I cried. I hurried to them, planning to throw my arms around 
them. 

But they thought I was just trying to get into my room. “Don’t go in there, 
Gary,” warned my dad. “You left your window open again, and a swarm of bees 
got in there.” 

“You’d better go next door,” Mom said. “Get Mr. Andretti. He’ll know how 
to get them out.” 

I couldn’t hold back any longer. I threw my arms around my mother’s neck 
and gave her a big kiss. “Mom, I missed you so much!” 

My mother hugged me back, but I saw her exchange a curious look with my 
dad. “Gary?” she asked. “Are you okay? How could you miss me when you’ve 
been right here in this house?” 

“Well...” I thought fast. “I meant that I missed spending time with you. We 
really need to do more things together.” 

My mother spread one hand over my forehead. “No. No temperature,” she 
told my father. 

“Gary,” Dad said impatiently. “Would you mind running over and getting 
Mr. Andretti? If we don’t get those bees out of your room, you’ll never be able 
to go to sleep tonight!” 

“Bees?” I said casually. “Hey, no problem. I’ll take care of them.” 

I reached out and started to open my door. Before I could, Dad grabbed my 
arm. “Gary!” he cried in alarm. “What’s the matter with you? There are bees in 
your room! B-E-E-S. Don’t you remember—you’re scared of bees!” 

I stared back at him and thought about what he’d said. To my surprise, I 
realized I was no longer the slightest bit scared of bees! In fact, I was actually 
looking forward to seeing them again. 

“No problem, Dad,” I told him. “I guess I must have outgrown that, or 
something.” 

I opened the door and went into my room. Sure enough, there was the old 
swarm, buzzing away over the plate of honey and crackers on the bed. 

“Hi, guys!” I said cheerfully. “Time to leave now!” 

I walked over to the bed and waved my hands at them, trying to shoo them 
back out the window. A few of them buzzed angrily at me. 

I laughed to myself. Then I picked up the plate of crackers and honey and 
dumped it out the window. “Go get it!” I told them. 



I shooed them gently out the window. 

“Good-bye!” I called to them as they left. “Thanks! Take good care of the 
honeycombs! I’ll try to come visit as soon as I can!” 

When the last bee was gone, I turned around and saw my parents. They 
were standing absolutely motionless in the doorway, staring at me, frozen with 
shock. 

“Dad?” I said. “Mom?” 

My dad blinked and seemed to come back to life. He crossed the room and 
put a hand on my shoulder. “Gary? Are you feeling all right?” 

“Just fine,” I replied, grinning happily. “Just fine.”

That whole crazy adventure happened about a month ago. 

Now it’s nearly fall. I’m sitting in my favorite place under the maple tree in 
the back yard, reading a book and chomping down taco chips. 

I just love coming out here. All the fall flowering plants are in bloom, and 
the yard is really pretty. 

I’ve been spending the last few days of my summer vacation relaxing back 
here. Of course, I also go to the playground a lot. 

The other day I ran into that girl with the red hair I saw coming out of the 
Person-to-Person office. We started talking, and I didn’t trip over my own feet or 
anything. She seems very nice. I hope she doesn’t plan to switch lives with 
anybody else! 

That conversation and a lot of things have made me realize that my short 
life as a bee really changed me. 

First of all, it taught me to appreciate my family for the first time ever. My 
parents are pretty nice. And my sister is okay. For a sister. 

And now, I’m not scared of any of the things I used to be scared of. 
Yesterday, I walked right by Marv, Barry, and Karl, and I didn’t bat an eye. 

In fact, when I remembered how I buzzed them, I almost burst out laughing. 

I’m not at all scared of them anymore. And I’m different in other ways, too. 

I’m a lot better at sports and bike riding and things. And I’m a great 
skateboarder now. In fact, I still give lessons. Judy and Kaitlyn hang around me 
all the time. And Gail and Louie, too. 

The other day, I actually ran into Dirk Davis at the playground. At first, I 
didn’t want to talk to him. But then he turned out to be pretty nice. 

He apologized to me. “I’m sorry I tried to steal your body,” he said. “But 
things didn’t turn out so well for me, either. That bee flunked all my math tests 
in summer school!” 

We both had a good laugh about that. And now Dirk and I are friends. 

So all in all, my life is back to normal. 

I feel terrific, totally normal. 

In fact, I feel much better than normal. 

It’s so great to sit here in the back yard, reading and relaxing, smelling the 



fresh fall air, enjoying the flowers. 

Mmmmmm. 

Those hollyhocks are really awesome. 

Excuse me a moment while I get up and take a closer look. 

That blossom down near the ground is so perfect. 

I think I’ll get down on my knees to take a quick taste. 

Do you know how to suck the pollen out? 

I’ve figured out the best way. It’s not as hard as it looks. 

You just pucker your lips and stick your tongue way out like this, see? 

Then you dip your face down into the blossom and suck up all the pollen 
you want. 

Try it. 

Go ahead. 

Mmmmmmmm. 

Go ahead. It’s easy. Really!

MONSTER BLOOD II 


Goosebumps - 18 
R.L. Stine 





1 


Evan Ross backed into the corner of the den as he stared at his dog Trigger. 

The tan cocker spaniel lowered his head and stared back at Evan with wet, 
brown eyes. The old dog’s tail began to wag excitedly. 

“Trigger—” Evan cried angrily. “Did you eat Monster Blood again?” 

The dog’s tail began wagging faster. Trigger let out a low bark that rumbled 
like thunder. 

Evan’s back pressed against the dark-paneled den wall. 

Trigger took a few heavy steps toward him, panting hard. His huge pink 
tongue, as big as a salami, hung out of his enormous mouth. 

“Did you?” Evan demanded. “Did you eat more Monster Blood?” 

The answer to Evan’s question was obvious. 

Trigger had been normal cocker spaniel size that morning. Now the dog 
stared down at Evan, as big as a pony. 

Trigger’s furry paws, the size of elephant hooves, thudded on the den 
carpet. His enormous tail pounded louder than a bass drum against the side of a 
leather couch. 

Evan covered his ears as Trigger let out an excited, high-pitched bark that 
shook the den walls. “Stay! Stay!” Evan shouted. 

The enormous dog panted hard, his tail wagging furiously. 

Oh, no! Evan thought in horror. He wants to play! 

“Sit!” Evan screamed. “Sit!” 

But Trigger didn’t know how to sit. For ten years —seventy dog years !— 
Evan had tried to teach Trigger to sit on command. 

But Trigger just didn’t get it. 

“Where did you find the Monster Blood?” Evan demanded. “We all saw it 
disappear into thin air. Gone. It was just gone. You know that stuff makes you 
grow. And grow and grow and grow. Where did you find it?” 

Trigger tilted his big head at an angle, as if trying to understand Evan’s 
words. Then, wagging his huge tail excitedly, he started to run to Evan. 

No! Evan thought. He’s going to jump on me! He’s going to jump! If he 
jumps, he’ll crush me! 



An enormous glob of drool escaped Trigger’s open mouth and hit the carpet 
with a loud smack. 

“Sit!” Evan cried, his voice choked with panic. “Sit, boy! Sit!” 

Trigger hesitated, staring down at Evan. To Evan’s horror, the dog was 
growing even bigger. Trigger was now as tall as a horse! 

Where did he find the container of Monster Blood? Evan wondered, his 
back pressed against the wall. Where? 

The dog’s brown eyes gaped at Evan like shimmering, dark pools. Trigger 
uttered another deafening bark that shook the whole house. 

“Yuck!” Evan cried, squeezing his nose with two fingers. The dog’s breath 
rushed at him like a strong wind. And it smelled as sour as a dead mouse. 

“Back! Get back, Trigger!” Evan pleaded. 

But Trigger had never learned that command, either. 

Without warning, the giant dog leaped at Evan. 

“Down! Down!” Evan shrieked. 

Trigger’s mouth gaped open. The dog’s huge tongue licked the side of 
Evan’s face. The tongue felt scratchy and hot. Evan’s carrot-colored hair was 
matted down with sticky dog saliva. 

“No—please!” Evan screamed. “I’m only twelve! I’m too young to die!” 

He started to scream again. But Trigger’s big teeth clamped around his 
waist, cutting off his breath. 

“Trigger—put me down! Put me down!” Evan choked out. 

The dog’s wagging tail sent a lamp crashing to the floor. 

The teeth held Evan gently but firmly. He felt himself being lifted off the 
floor. 

“Put me down! Put me down!” 

Why wouldn’t the stupid dog listen? 

Evan thrashed his arms and legs frantically, trying to squirm free. But 
Trigger held on tightly. 

The dog’s enormous paws pounded on the carpet. He carried Evan through 
the hall and across the kitchen. Then he lowered his head and butted the kitchen 
screen door open. 

The door slammed hard behind them. Trigger began trotting over the grass. 

“Bad dog! Bad dog!” Evan cried. His voice came out in a tiny squeak. 

Had Trigger grown even bigger? 

Evan was at least three feet off the ground now! 



“Put me down! Down!” he cried. 

Evan watched the green grass of the back yard bounce beneath him. Trigger 
was panting as he walked. The panting sounds made Evan’s whole body vibrate. 
He realized his jeans and T-shirt were soaked from dog saliva. Trigger doesn’t 
mean to hurt me, Evan told himself. He’s just being playful. Thank goodness 
he’s such an old dog. His teeth aren’t very sharp. 

The dog stopped at the edge of the flower garden in the back of the yard. 
He lowered Evan nearly to the ground, but didn’t let go. 

His paws began to churn up the soft dirt. 

“Let me down!” Evan shrieked. “Trigger—listen to me!” 

Breathing hard, his hot, sour breath pouring over Evan, the big dog 
continued to dig. 

A wave of horror swept over Evan as he realized what Trigger was doing. 
“No!” Evan shrieked. “Don’t bury me, Trigger!” 

The dog dug faster, its front paws churning furiously. The soft dirt flew past 
Evan’s face. 

“I’m not a bone!” Evan cried frantically. “Trigger—I’m not a bone! Don’t 
bury me, Trigger! Please—don’t bury me!”

“Don’t bury me. Please don’t bury me!” Evan murmured. 

He heard laughter. 

He raised his head and glanced around—and realized that he wasn’t home 
in his back yard. He was sitting in his assigned seat in the third row near the 
window in Mr. Murphy’s science class. 

And Mr. Murphy was standing right at Evan’s side, his enormous, round 
body blocking the sunlight from the window. “Earth calling Evan! Earth calling 
Evan!” Mr. Murphy called, cupping his chubby pink hands over his mouth to 
make a megaphone. 

The kids all laughed. 

Evan could feel his face growing hot. “S-sorry,” he stammered. 

“You seem to have been somewhere in Daydream Land,” Mr. Murphy said, 
his tiny black eyes twinkling merrily. 

“Yes,” Evan replied solemnly. “I was dreaming about Monster Blood. I—I 
can’t stop thinking about it.” 

Ever since his frightening adventure the past summer with the green, sticky 
stuff, Evan had been dreaming and daydreaming about it. 

“Evan, please,” Mr. Murphy said softly. He shook his round, pink head and 
made a “tsk-tsk” sound. 

“Monster Blood is real!” Evan blurted out angrily. 

The kids laughed again. 

Mr. Murphy’s expression grew stern. His tiny eyes locked onto Evan’s. 
“Evan, I am a science teacher. You don’t expect a science teacher to believe that 
you found a can of sticky green gunk in a toy store that makes things grow and 
grow.” 

“Y-yes, I do,” Evan insisted. 

“Maybe a science-fiction teacher would believe it,” Mr. Murphy replied, 
grinning at his own joke. “Not a science teacher.” 

“Well, you’re dumb!” Evan cried. 

He didn’t mean to say it. He knew immediately that he had just made a 
major mistake. 

He heard gasps all around the big classroom. 



Mr. Murphy’s pink face darkened until it looked like a red balloon. But he 
didn’t lose his temper. He clasped his chubby hands over the big stomach of his 
green sportshirt, and Evan could see him silently counting to ten. 

“Evan, you’re a new student here, isn’t that right?” he asked finally. His 
face slowly returned to its normal pink color. 

“Yes,” Evan replied, his voice just above a whisper. “My family just moved 
to Atlanta this fall.” 

“Well, perhaps you’re not familiar with the way things work here. Perhaps 
at your old school the teachers liked it when you called them dumb. Perhaps you 
called your teachers ugly names all day long. Perhaps—” 

“No, sir,” Evan interrupted, lowering his head. “It just slipped out.” 

Laughter rang through the classroom. Mr. Murphy glared sternly at Evan, 
his face twisted in an angry frown. 

Give me a break, Evan thought unhappily. Glancing quickly around the 
room, Evan saw a sea of grinning faces. 

I think I’m in trouble again, Evan thought glumly. Why can’t I keep my big 
mouth shut? 

Mr. Murphy glanced up at the wall clock. “School is nearly over,” he said. 
“Why don’t you do us all a little favor, Evan, to make up for the time you made 
us waste today?” 

Uh oh, Evan thought darkly. Here it comes. 

“When the bell rings, go put your books away in your locker,” Mr. Murphy 
instructed. “Then come back here and clean Cuddles’ cage.” 

Evan groaned. 

His eyes darted to the hamster cage against the wall. Cuddles was 
scratching around in the wood shavings on the cage floor. 

Not the hamster! Evan thought unhappily. 

Evan hated Cuddles. And Mr. Murphy knew it. This was the third time Mr. 
Murphy had made Evan stay after school and clean out the gross, disgusting 
cage. 

“Perhaps while you clean the hamster cage,” Mr. Murphy said, returning to 
his desk, “you can think about how to do better in science class, Evan.” 

Evan jumped to his feet. “I won’t do it!” he cried. 

He heard shocked gasps all around him. 

“I hate Cuddles!” Evan screamed. “I hate that stupid, fat hamster!” 

As everyone stared in amazed horror, Evan ran over to the cage, pulled 



open the door, and grabbed Cuddles up in one hand. 

Then, with an easy, graceful motion, he flung the hamster across the room 
—and out the open window.

Evan knew he was having another daydream. 

He didn’t jump up screaming and throw the hamster out the window. 

He only thought about it. Everyone thinks about doing crazy, wild things 
once in a while. 

But Evan would never do anything that crazy. 

Instead, he said, “Okay, Mr. Murphy.” Then he sat quietly in his seat, 
staring out the window at the puffy white clouds in the bright blue sky. 

He could see his own reflection staring back at him in the glass. His curly, 
carrot-colored hair looked darker in the reflection. So did the freckles that dotted 
his cheeks. 

His expression was mournful. He hated being made fun of in front of the 
entire class. 

Why am I always getting myself into trouble? he wondered. Why can’t Mr. 
Murphy ever give me a break? Didn’t the teacher realize how hard it was to be 
the new kid in school? How am I supposed to make new friends if Murphy is 
always making me look like a total jerk in class? 

Bad enough that no one believed him about the Monster Blood. 

Evan had eagerly told the kids in his new school about it. How he had 
stayed with his great-aunt the past summer. How he and a girl he met named 
Andy had found the blue container of Monster Blood in a creepy, old toy store. 

And how the green, yucky Monster Blood had started to grow and grow. 
How it had bubbled out of its container, outgrown a bucket, outgrown a bath tub! 
And just kept growing and growing as if it were alive! 

And Evan had told kids how Trigger had eaten just a little of the Monster 
Blood—and had grown nearly as big as a house! 

It was such a frightening, amazing story. Evan was sure his new friends 
would find it really cool. 

But, instead, they just thought he was weird. 

No one believed him. They laughed at him and told him he had a sick 
imagination. 

Evan became known around his new school as the kid who made up stupid 
stories. 



If only I could prove to them that the story is true, Evan often thought sadly. 
If only I could show them the Monster Blood. 

But the mysterious green gunk had vanished from sight before Evan left his 
great-aunt’s house. Not a trace of it had been left. Not a trace. 

The bell rang. Everyone jumped up and headed for the door, talking and 
laughing. 

Evan knew that a lot of his classmates were laughing at him. Ignoring them, 
Evan picked up his backpack and started to the door. 

“Hurry back, Evan,” Mr. Murphy called from behind his desk. “Cuddles is 
waiting!” 

Evan growled under his breath and stepped out into the crowded hallway. If 
Murphy loves that stupid hamster so much, why doesn’t he ever clean out the 
cage? he wondered bitterly. 

A group of kids laughed loudly as Evan passed by. Were they laughing at 
him? Evan couldn’t tell. 

He started jogging to his locker—when something hit his leg just above the 
ankle. His feet flew out from under him, and he toppled face down onto the hard 
tile floor. 

“Hey—!” Evan cried angrily. 

He stared up at a big, tough-looking kid from his class named Conan 
Barber. All the kids called him Conan the Barbarian. For good reason. 

Conan was twelve, but he looked about twenty years older! He was taller 
and wider and stronger and meaner than any kid in the school. 

He wasn’t a bad-looking guy, Evan grudgingly admitted. He had wavy, 
blond hair, blue eyes, and a handsome face. He was very athletic-looking, and 
played all the sports at school. 

He was an okay guy, Evan thought wistfully. 

Except that he had one very bad habit. Conan loved to live up to his 
nickname. 

He loved being Conan the Barbarian. 

He loved strutting around, pounding kids who weren’t his size—which 
included everyone! 

Evan had not hit it off with Conan. 

He met Conan on the playground a few weeks after moving to Atlanta. 
Eager to make a good impression, Evan told him the whole Monster Blood story. 

Conan didn’t like the story. He stared back at Evan with his cold, blue eyes 



for a long, long time. Then his expression hardened, and he murmured through 
clenched teeth: “We don’t like wise guys down here in Atlanta.” 

He gave Evan a pretty good pounding that day. 

Evan had tried to stay away from Conan ever since. But it wasn’t easy. 

Now he gazed up at Conan from his position on the floor. “Hey—why’d 
you trip me?” Evan demanded shrilly. 

Conan grinned down at him and shrugged. “It was an accident.” 

Evan tried to decide whether it was safer to stand up or to stay down on the 
floor. If I stand up, he’ll punch me, he thought. If I stay down here, he’ll step on 
me. 

Tough choice. 

He didn’t get to make it. Conan reached down and, with one hand, pulled 
Evan to his feet. 

“Give me a break, Conan!” Evan pleaded. “Why can’t you leave me 
alone?” 

Conan shrugged again. It was one of his favorite replies. His blue eyes 
twinkled merrily. “You’re right, Evan,” he said, his grin fading. “I shouldn’t have 
tripped you.” 

“Yeah,” Evan agreed, straightening his T-shirt. 

“So you can pay me back,” Conan offered. 

“Huh?” Evan gaped at him. 

Conan stuck out his massive chest. “Go ahead. Hit me in the stomach. I’ll 
let you.” 

“Whoa. No way,” Evan replied, trying to back up. He stumbled into a group 
of kids. 

“Go ahead,” Conan urged, following after him. “Hit me in the stomach. As 
hard as you can. It’s only fair.” 

Evan studied his expression. “You really mean it?” 

Conan nodded, tight-lipped. He stuck out his chest. “As hard as you can. 
Go ahead. I won’t hit back. I promise.” 

Evan hesitated. Should he go ahead and do it? 

I may never get a chance like this again, he thought. 

A lot of kids were watching, Evan realized. 

If I hit him really hard, if I hurt him, if I make him cry out—then maybe 
kids around here will have a little respect for me. 

I’ll be Evan the Giant Killer. The guy who pounded Conan the Barbarian. 



He balled his hand into a tight fist and raised it. 

“Is that your fist?” Conan cried, laughing. 

Evan nodded. 

“Oooh—this is going to hurt!” Conan cried sarcastically. He made his knees 
tremble. 

Everyone laughed. 

I may surprise him, Evan thought angrily. 

“Go ahead. As hard as you can,” Conan urged. He sucked in a deep breath 
and held it. 

Evan pulled his arm back and swung his fist as hard as he could. 

The fist made a solid thud as it hit Conan’s stomach. 

It felt like hitting a concrete wall. 

Evan’s hand throbbed with pain. 

“Hey—!” a man’s voice called angrily. 

Startled, Evan spun around—to see Mr. Murphy glaring at him. 

“No fighting!” Mr. Murphy yelled at Evan. 

The teacher came bouncing up to them and stepped between the two boys. 
Huffing for breath, he turned to Conan. “Why did Evan hit you?” he demanded.

Conan shrugged. His blue eyes went wide and innocent. “I don’t know, Mr. 
Murphy,” he replied in a tiny, forlorn voice. “Evan just walked up and hit me as 
hard as he could.” 

Conan rubbed his stomach and uttered a short whimper. “Ow. He really hurt 

me.” 

Mr. Murphy narrowed his beady black eyes at Evan. His chubby face turned 
bright red again. “Evan, I saw the whole thing. I really don’t understand you,” he 
said softly. 

“But Mr. Murphy—” Evan started. 

The teacher raised a hand to silence him. “If you were angry about what 
happened in class,” Mr. Murphy said, “you shouldn’t take it out on other kids.” 

Conan rubbed his stomach tenderly. “I hope Evan didn’t break anything!” 
he murmured. 

“Do you want to see the nurse?” Mr. Murphy asked. 

Conan shook his head. Evan could see he was having trouble keeping a 
straight face. “I’ll be okay,” he said, and staggered away. 

What a phony! Evan thought bitterly. 

Did Conan know the whole time that Murphy was standing there? Probably. 

“Go take care of Cuddles,” Mr. Murphy told Evan, frowning. “And try to 
shape up, Evan. I’m going to be watching you.” 

Evan muttered a reply and trudged back into the classroom. Sunlight 
streamed in through the wall of windows. A strong breeze made the window 
shade flap over the open window near the teacher’s desk. 

Feeling angry and upset, his stomach churning, Evan made his way through 
the empty room to the hamster cage. Cuddles wrinkled his nose in greeting. The 
hamster knew the routine by now. 

Evan gazed into the metal cage at the brown-and-white creature. Why do 
people think hamsters are cute? he wondered. 

Because they wrinkle their noses? Because they run around and around on 
wheels like total jerks? Because of their cute little buck teeth? 

Cuddles stared up at him with his little black eyes. 

He has Mr. Murphy’s eyes, Evan thought, chuckling to himself. Maybe 



that’s why Murphy likes him so much. 

“Okay, okay. So you’re kind of cute,” Evan told the hamster. “But I know 
your secret. You’re just a big fat rat in disguise!” 

Cuddles wrinkled his nose again in reply. 

With a loud sigh, Evan went to work. Holding his breath because he hated 
the smell, he pulled out the bottom tray. 

“You’re a messy little guy,” he told the hamster. “When are you going to 
learn to clean up your own room?” 

Still holding his breath, he dumped out the old newspaper shavings and 
replaced them with fresh shavings from the box in the supply closet. 

He returned the bottom tray to its place as Cuddles watched with great 
interest. Then he poured fresh water into the water bottle. 

“How about some sunflower seeds?” Evan asked. He began to feel a little 
more cheerful, knowing his job was almost finished. 

He removed the seed cup from the cage and made his way across the room 
to the supply closet to get fresh sunflower seeds. 

“Okay, Cuddles,” he called, “these look yummy!” 

He started to carry the seeds back to the cage. Halfway across the room, 
Evan stopped and uttered a startled gasp. 

The cage door hung wide open. 

The hamster was gone.

A choking sound escaped Evan’s lips as he stared at the empty cage. 

His eyes darted frantically around the room. “Cuddles? Cuddles?” he called 
in a frightened voice. 

Why am I yelling? he asked himself, spinning around in a total panic. The 
dumb hamster doesn’t know its name! 

He heard footsteps out in the hall. 

Mr. Murphy? 

No, please—no! Evan pleaded silently. 

Don’t let it be Mr. Murphy. Don’t let him return until I have Cuddles safely 
back in his cage. 

Cuddles was Mr. Murphy’s most precious possession. He had told this to 
the class time and again. 

Evan knew that if anything happened to Cuddles, Mr. Murphy would be on 
Evan’s case for the rest of the year. No—for the rest of his life! 

Evan froze in the center of the room, listening hard. 

The footsteps passed by the room. 

Evan started breathing again. 

“Cuddles? Where are you, Cuddles?” he called in a trembling voice. “I have 
some delicious sunflower seeds for you.” 

He spotted the furry, brown-and-white creature on the chalk tray under the 
front chalkboard. 

“There you are! I see you!” Evan whispered, tiptoeing toward it. 

Cuddles was busily chewing on something. A small piece of white chalk. 

Evan tiptoed closer. “I have seeds for you, Cuddles,” he whispered. “Much 
tastier than chalk.” 

Cuddles held the stick of chalk in his front paws, turning it as he chewed. 

Evan crept closer. Closer. 

“Look. Seeds.” He held the plastic seed cup toward the hamster. 

Cuddles didn’t look up. 

Evan crept up closer. Closer. 

Close enough to dive forward— 



—and miss! 

The hamster dropped the chalk and scampered down the chalk tray. 

Evan made another frantic grab—and came up with nothing but air. 

Letting out a frustrated groan, Evan saw the hamster dive to the floor and 
scamper behind Mr. Murphy’s desk. The hamster’s feet skidded and slid on the 
linoleum floor, its toenails clicking loudly. 

“You can’t get away! You’re too fat!” Evan cried. He dropped to his knees 
and peered under the desk. 

He could see Cuddles staring back at him from the darkness. The animal 
was breathing rapidly, its sides swelling with each breath. 

“Don’t be scared,” Evan whispered soothingly. “I’m going to put you back 
in your nice, safe cage.” 

He crawled quickly to the desk. 

The hamster stared back at him, breathing hard. It didn’t move—until Evan 
reached for him. Then Cuddles scampered away, his tiny paws sliding on the 
floor. 

Evan jumped angrily to his feet. “Cuddles—what’s your problem?” he 
demanded loudly. “This isn’t a stupid game!” 

It wasn’t a game at all, Evan knew. 

If he didn’t get the hamster back in the cage, Mr. Murphy would flunk him 
for sure. Or suspend him from school. Or get his family kicked out of Atlanta! 

Calm down, Evan urged himself. Don’t panic. 

He took a deep breath and held it. 

Then he saw the hamster on the window ledge just inside the open window. 

Okay, Evan—go ahead and panic! he told himself. 

This was definitely panic time. 

He tried to call to the hamster. But his voice came out a choked whisper. 

Swallowing hard, Evan edged slowly toward the window ledge. 

“Come here, Cuddles,” he whispered. “Please, Cuddles—come here.” 

Closer, closer. 

Almost close enough to reach the hamster. 

Almost close enough. 

“Don’t move, Cuddles. Don’t move.” 

He reached out his hand slowly. Slowly. 

Cuddles glanced back at him with his soft black eyes. 

Then the hamster jumped out the window.

Evan hung back for only a second. 

Then he jumped out the window after the hamster. 

Luckily, the science classroom was on the ground floor. Evan landed face 
down in a low evergreen hedge. Struggling and squirming, it took him a while to 
climb to his feet. 

He took several steps over the grass, then turned and stared back along the 
bottom of the long hedge. “Cuddles—are you under there?” 

Evan squatted down to get a better view. The hedge stretched the entire 
length of the school building. Cuddles could hide under there forever. 

And if I don’t find him, Evan told himself bitterly, I’d better hide under 
there forever, too! 

To the right, Evan could hear voices from the playground. Happy, shouting 
voices. Carefree voices. 

Still squatting, he turned toward the happy voices—and saw a fat brown 
ball wobbling over the grass toward the playground. 

No. Not a ball. “Cuddles!” 

That fat hamster isn’t getting away this time! Evan decided, jumping up and 
starting to chase after the creature. I’ll catch him if I have to sit on him! 

A picture flashed into Evan’s mind of Cuddles, flat as a pancake after Evan 
had sat upon him. A little, round, furry hamster rug. 

Despite his panic, the thought of Cuddles as a rug brought a smile to Evan’s 
perspiring face. 

As he ran, he kept his eyes on Cuddles. The hamster was wobbling rapidly 
over the grass toward the playground. 

“Oh, no!” Evan cried out in horror as Cuddles darted in front of two girls 
speeding across the grass on bikes. 

Laughing together, they didn’t even see the hamster. 

Cuddles is about to be road kill! Evan thought, shrinking back. He shut his 
eyes and waited for the squish. 

But the bikes rolled smoothly on. And when they had passed, Evan spotted 
Cuddles continuing his journey to the playground unharmed. 

“Cuddles—come back here!” he shouted furiously. 



The hamster appeared to speed up. He tumbled onto the baseball diamond, 
all four paws scurrying over the dirt of the third-base line. 

Several kids stopped their game to stare. 

“Stop him! Grab the hamster!” Evan shouted desperately. 

But the kids only laughed. 

“Know how to catch him?” a joker named Robbie Greene called to Evan. 
“Make a sound like a sunflower seed!” 

“That’s an old joke!” a girl called to Robbie. 

“Thanks for your help!” Evan shouted sarcastically. He ran over the 
pitching mound and had crossed second base when he realized he had lost sight 
of Cuddles. 

He stopped and spun around, his heart thudding wildly in his chest. He 
searched the grass of the infield. “Where—where is he?” he stammered. “Do you 
see him?” 

But the kids had returned to their softball game. 

I can’t lose him now! Evan told himself, choked with panic. I can’t! 

Sweat poured down Evan’s forehead. He mopped it with one hand, 
brushing back his curly, red hair. His T-shirt clung wetly to his back. His mouth 
felt dry as cotton. 

Jogging into the outfield, he searched the grass. 

“Cuddles?” 

No sign of him. 

A round, brownish lump in the grass turned out to be someone’s baseball 
glove. 

“Cuddles?” 

A kickball game was underway on the opposite diamond. Kids were 
shouting and cheering. Evan saw Bree Douglas, a girl from his class, slide hard 
into second base just before the ball. 

“Has—has anyone seen Cuddles?” Evan gasped, trotting onto the diamond. 

Kids turned to gawk at him. 

“Out here?” Bree called, brushing off the knees of her jeans. “Evan, did you 
take the hamster out for a walk?” 

Everyone laughed. Scornful laughter. 

“He—he got away,” Evan replied, panting. 

“Is this what you’re looking for?” a familiar voice called. 

Evan turned to see Conan Barber, a pleased smile on his handsome face, his 



blue eyes gleaming. 

Gripping it by its furry back, Conan held the hamster up in one hand. 
Cuddles’ four legs scurried in midair. 

“You—you caught him!” Evan cried gratefully. He let out a long sigh of 
relief. “He jumped out the window.” 

Evan reached out both hands for the hamster, but Conan jerked Cuddles out 
of his reach. “Prove it’s yours,” Conan said, grinning. 

“Huh?” 

“Can you identify it?” Conan demanded, his eyes burning into Evan’s, 
challenging Evan. “Prove this hamster is yours.” 

Evan swallowed hard and glanced around. 

Kids from the kickball game were huddling near. They were all grinning, 
delighted with Conan’s mean joke. 

Evan sighed wearily and reached again for the hamster. 

But Conan was at least a foot taller than Evan. He lifted the hamster high 
above Evan’s head, out of Evan’s reach. 

“Prove it’s yours,” he repeated, flashing the others a grin. 

“Give me a break, Conan,” Evan pleaded. “I’ve been chasing this stupid 
hamster for hours. I just want to get him back in his cage before Mr. Murphy—” 

“Do you have a license for him?” Conan demanded, still holding the 
squirming hamster above Evan’s head. “Show me the license.” 

Evan jumped and stretched both hands up, trying to grab Cuddles away. 

But Conan was too fast for him. He dodged away. Evan grabbed air. 

Some kids laughed. 

“Give him the hamster, Conan,” Bree called. She hadn’t moved from 
second base. 

Conan’s cold blue eyes sparkled excitedly. “I’ll tell you how you can get the 
hamster back,” he told Evan. 

“Huh?” Evan glared at him. He was getting really tired of Conan’s game. 

“Here’s how to get old Cuddles back,” Conan continued, holding the 
hamster tightly against his chest in one hand and petting its back with the other. 
“Sing a song for it.” 

“Hey—no way!” Evan snapped. “Give it to me, Conan!” 

Evan could feel his face growing even hotter. His knees started to tremble. 
He hoped no one could see it. 

“Sing ‘Row, Row, Row Your Boat’, and I’ll give you Cuddles. Promise,” 



Conan said, smirking. 

Some kids laughed. They moved closer, eager to see what Evan would do. 

Evan shook his head. “No way.” 

“Come on,” Conan urged softly, stroking the hamster’s brown fur. “'Row, 
Row, Row Your Boat.’ Just a few choruses. You know how it goes, don’t you?” 

More cruel laughter from the others. 

Conan’s grin grew wider. “Come on, Evan. You like to sing, don’t you?” 

“No, I hate singing,” Evan muttered, his eyes on Cuddles. 

“Hey, don’t be modest,” Conan insisted. “I’ll bet you’re a great singer. Are 
you a soprano or an alto?” 

Loud laughter. 

Evan’s hands tightened into hard fists at his sides. He wanted to punch 
Conan, and punch him and punch him. He wanted to wipe the grin off Conan’s 
handsome face with his fists. 

But he remembered what it had felt like to punch Conan. It had felt like 
hitting the side of a truck. 

He took a deep breath. “If I sing the stupid song, will you really give me 
back the hamster?” 

Conan didn’t reply. 

Evan suddenly realized that Conan wasn’t looking at him anymore. No one 
was. They had all raised their eyes over Evan’s shoulder. 

Confused, Evan spun around—to face Mr. Murphy. 

“What is going on here?” the teacher demanded, his tiny black eyes moving 
from Evan to Conan, then back to Evan. 

Before Evan could reply, Conan held up the hamster. “Here’s Cuddles, Mr. 
Murphy,” Conan said. “Evan let him get away. But I rescued Cuddles just as he 
was going to get run over.” 

Mr. Murphy let out a horrified gasp. “Run over?” he cried. “Cuddles? Run 
over?” 

The teacher reached out his chubby pink hands and took the hamster from 
Conan. He held the hamster against his bulging shirt and petted it, making 
soothing sounds to it. 

“Thank you, Conan,” Mr. Murphy said after calming Cuddles. He glared at 
Evan. “I’m very disappointed in you, Evan.” 

Evan started to defend himself. But Mr. Murphy raised a hand to silence 
him. “We’ll talk about it tomorrow. Right now I must get poor Cuddles back into 



his cage.” 

Evan slumped to the ground. He watched Mr. Murphy carry the hamster 
back to the school building. Mr. Murphy waddles just like the hamster, Evan 
realized. 

Normally, that thought would have cheered him up. 

But Evan was far too unhappy to be cheered up by anything. 

Conan had embarrassed him in front of all the others. And the big, grinning 
hulk had managed to get Evan in trouble with Mr. Murphy twice in one 
afternoon! 

The kickball game had started up again. Evan climbed slowly to his feet 
and began trudging to the school building to get his backpack. 

He couldn’t decide who he hated more—Cuddles or Conan. 

He had a sudden picture of Cuddles stuffed inside a muffin tin, being baked 
in an oven. 

Even that lovely thought didn’t cheer Evan up. 

He pulled his backpack out of the locker and slung it over his shoulder. 
Then he slammed the locker shut, the sound clanging down the empty hallway. 

He pushed open the front door and headed for home, walking slowly, lost in 
his unhappy thoughts. 

What a horrible day, he told himself. At least nothing worse could happen 
to me today. 

He had just crossed the street and was making his way on the sidewalk in 
front of a tall hedge—when someone leaped out at him, grabbed his shoulders 
hard from behind, and pulled him roughly to the ground. 

Evan let out a frightened cry and gazed into his attacker’s face. “You!” he 
cried.

“Here’s a little advice, Evan,” Andy said, grinning down at him. “Don’t go out 
for the wrestling team.” 

“Andy!” Evan cried, staring up at her in surprise. “What are you doing 
here?” 

She reached out both hands and helped tug him to his feet. Then she tossed 
back her short, brown hair with a flick of her head. Her brown eyes flashed 
excitedly. 

“Didn’t you read any of my letters?” she demanded. 

Evan had met Andy the past summer, when he’d stayed with his great-aunt 
for a few weeks. He and Andy had become good friends. 

She was with him when he bought the container of Monster Blood. She 
shared the whole frightening Monster Blood adventure with him. 

Evan liked Andy because she was funny, and fearless, and kind of crazy. He 
never could predict what she would do next! 

She didn’t even dress like other girls Evan knew. Andy loved bright colors. 
Right now she was wearing a sleeveless magenta T-shirt over bright yellow 
shorts, which matched her yellow sneakers. 

“I told you in my last letter that my parents were sent overseas for a year,” 
Andy said, giving Evan a playful shove. “I told you they were sending me to 
Atlanta to live with my aunt and uncle. I told you I’d be living just three blocks 
away from you!” 

“I know. I know,” Evan replied, rolling his eyes. “I just didn’t expect to see 
you jump out of the hedge at me.” 

“Why not?” Andy demanded, her dark eyes exploring his. 

Evan didn’t know how to answer that question. 

“Glad to see me?” Andy asked. 

“No,” he joked. 

She pulled up a thick blade of grass and stuck it in the corner of her mouth. 
They began walking toward Evan’s house. 

“I’m starting at your school on Monday,” she told him, chewing on the 
blade of grass. 

“Thrills and chills,” he replied, snickering. 



She shoved him off the sidewalk. “I thought people were supposed to be 
polite in the South.” 

“I’m new here,” Evan replied. 

“How’s Trigger?” she asked, kicking a pebble across the sidewalk. 

“Good,” Evan told her. 

“Like to talk a lot?” she asked sarcastically. 

“I’m in a bad mood,” he confessed. “It hasn’t been the greatest day.” 

“It couldn’t be as bad as the day the Monster Blood went berserk!” Andy 
exclaimed. 

Evan groaned. “Don’t mention Monster Blood to me. Please!” 

She studied him. Her expression turned serious. “What’s wrong, Evan? You 
look really upset,” she said. “Don’t you like it here?” 

He shook his head. “Not much.” 

As they walked, he told her about all the trouble he was having in his new 
school. He told her about Mr. Murphy and Cuddles, and how the teacher was 
always on his case. 

And he told her about Conan the Barbarian, and how Conan was always 
picking on him, always getting him into trouble, always playing tricks on him 
and making him look bad. 

“And no one will believe me about the Monster Blood,” Evan added. 

They were standing at the bottom of his driveway. They glanced up at 
Evan’s new house, a two-story red brick house with a sloping red tile roof. The 
late afternoon sun dipped behind a large puff of cloud, and a broad shadow 
rolled across the lawn. 

Andy’s mouth dropped open. The blade of grass fell out. “You told kids 
about the Monster Blood?” she asked in surprise. 

Evan nodded. “Yeah, why not? It’s a cool story, isn’t it?” 

“And you expected kids to believe you?” Andy cried, slapping her 
forehead. “Didn’t they just think you were weird?” 

“Yeah,” Evan replied bitterly. “They all think I’m weird.” 

Andy laughed. “Well, you are weird!” 

“Thanks a bunch, Annnndrea!” Evan muttered. He knew she hated to be 
called by her real name. 

“Don’t call me Andrea,” she replied sharply. She raised a fist. “I’ll pound 
you.” 

“Annnnnndrea,” he repeated. He ducked away as she swung her fist. “You 



punch like a girl!” he exclaimed. 

“You’ll bleed like a boy!” she threatened, laughing. 

He stopped. He suddenly had an idea. “Hey—you can tell everyone I’m not 
weird!” 

“Huh? Why would I do that?” Andy demanded. 

“No. Really,” Evan said excitedly. “You can tell everyone at school that the 
Monster Blood was real. That you were there. That you saw it.” 

Andy’s expression suddenly changed. Her dark eyes lit up, and a sly grin 
crossed her face. “I can do better than that,” she said mysteriously. 

Evan grabbed her shoulder. “Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean 
you can do better?” 

“You’ll see,” she replied, teasing him. “I brought something with me.” 

“What? What is it? What do you mean?” Evan demanded. 

“Meet me tomorrow after school,” she told him. “At that little park over 
there.” 

She pointed to the next block. A narrow park, only a few blocks long, ran 
along the bank of a shallow creek. 

“But what is it?” Evan cried. 

She laughed. “I love torturing you!” she declared. “But it’s a little too easy.” 

Then she turned and headed down the street, running at full speed. 

“Andy—wait!” Evan called. “What have you got? What did you bring?” 

She didn’t even turn around.

Evan dreamed about Monster Blood that night. 

He dreamed about it nearly every night. 

Tonight he dreamed that his dad had eaten a glob of it. Now Mr. Ross 
wanted to go to his office, but he had grown too big to fit through the door. 

“You’re in trouble now, Evan!” Mr. Ross bellowed, making the whole 
house shake. “Big trouble!” 

Big trouble. 

The words stuck in Evan’s mind as he sat up in bed and tried to shake away 
the dream. 

The curtains flapped silently in front of his open bedroom window. Pale 
yellow stars dotted the charcoal sky. Staring hard, Evan could see the Big 
Dipper. Or was it the Little Dipper? He never could remember. 

Shutting his eyes and settling back on the pillow, Evan thought about Andy. 
He was glad she had come to stay in Atlanta for a while. She could be a real 
pain. But she was also a lot of fun. 

What did she want to show him in the park after school? 

Probably nothing, Evan guessed. It was probably just a dumb joke. Andy 
loved dumb jokes. 

How can I get her to tell the kids at school about Monster Blood? he 
wondered. How can I get Andy to tell everyone that I didn’t make it up, that it’s 
true? 

He was still thinking about this problem as he fell back into a restless sleep. 

The next day at school wasn’t much better than the last. 

Somehow during free reading period, Conan had crept under the table and 
tied Evan’s sneaker laces together. When Evan got up to go to the water 
fountain, he fell flat on his face. He scraped a knee, but no one cared. The kids 
laughed for hours. 

“Evan’s mommy tied his shoes funny this morning!” Conan told everyone. 
And they laughed even harder. 

In science class, Mr. Murphy called Evan over to the hamster cage. “Look 
at poor Cuddles,” the teacher said, shaking his round head solemnly. 



Evan peered down into the metal cage. Cuddles was curled up in a corner 
under a pile of shavings. The hamster was trembling and breathing in short 
gasps. 

“Poor Cuddles has been like that ever since yesterday,” Mr. Murphy told 
Evan with an accusing frown. “Cuddles is sick because of your carelessness.” 

“I—I’m sorry,” Evan stammered. He stared hard at the quivering hamster. 
You’re faking—aren’t you, Cuddles? Evan thought. You’re faking just to get me 
in trouble! 

The hamster twitched and stared up at him with mournful, black eyes. 

When Evan sat back down in his seat, he felt cold water seep through the 
back of his jeans. With a startled cry, he jumped right back up. Someone— 
probably Conan—had poured a cup of water on his chair. 

That had the class laughing for at least ten minutes. They stopped only 
when Mr. Murphy threatened to keep everyone after school. 

“Sit down, Evan,” the teacher ordered. 

“But, Mr. Murphy—” Evan started. 

“Sit down—now!” Mr. Murphy insisted. 

Evan dropped back down into the wet chair. What choice did he have? 

Andy was waiting for Evan by the trickling brown creek that rolled through the 
tiny park. The old sassafras trees bent and whispered in a hot breeze. A tall 
Georgia pine leaned over the water as if trying to reach across the creek. 

Andy was wearing a bright blue T-shirt over lime-green short-shorts. She 
had been staring at her reflection in the muddy creek water. She spun around 
smiling as Evan called to her. 

“Hey, how’s it going?” he called. He stepped up beside her and dropped his 
backpack to the ground. 

“How was school?” Andy asked. 

“Same as always,” Evan replied, sighing. Then his expression brightened. 
“What did you bring?” he asked eagerly. 

“You’ll see.” She clasped a hand over his eyes. “Shut your eyes, Evan. And 
don’t open them until I say.” 

He obediently shut his eyes. But when she pulled her hand away, he opened 
them a tiny crack, just enough to see. He watched her go behind the pine tree and 
pick up a small brown paper bag. 

She carried the bag over to him. “You’re peeking—aren’t you?” she 



accused him. 

“Maybe,” he confessed, grinning. 

She punched him playfully in the stomach. He cried out and his eyes shot 
open. “What’s in the bag?” 

Grinning, Andy handed the bag to him. 

He pulled it open, peered inside—and his mouth dropped open in shock. 

The familiar blue can, about the size of a can of soup. 

“Andy—you—you—” Evan stammered, still staring wide-eyed into the 

bag. 

He reached in and pulled out the plastic can. 

He read the faded label: MONSTER BLOOD. 

Then he read the words in tiny type below it: SURPRISING MIRACLE 
SUBSTANCE. 

“I saved it,” Andy said, beaming proudly. 

Evan couldn’t get over his shock. “You brought Monster Blood! I don’t 
believe it! You brought Monster Blood!” 

“No.” She shook her head. “It’s empty, Evan. The can is empty.” 

His face fell. He sighed in total disappointment. 

“But you can show the can to everyone,” Andy insisted. “That will prove 
you didn’t make it up. It will prove that Monster Blood really exists.” 

Evan sighed again. “What good is an empty can?” he groaned. 

He pulled off the top, peered inside—and screamed. 



9 


With a trembling hand, Evan tilted the can so that Andy could see inside. 

“Oh, no!” she shrieked, pulling her hands to her cheeks. 

The can was half full. 

Inside, a green glob of gooey Monster Blood shimmered in the sunlight like 
lime jell-o. 

“But it was empty!” Andy protested, staring into the can. “I know it was!” 

Evan shook the can. The green glob inside quivered. 

“There must have been a tiny speck in there,” Evan guessed. “Down at the 
bottom of the can. And now it’s growing and growing again.” 

“Great!” Andy declared. She slapped him on the back so hard, he nearly 
dropped the blue can. 

“Great? What’s so great?” he demanded shakily. 

“Now you can show this to the kids at your school,” she replied. “Now 
they’ll have to believe you.” 

“I guess,” Evan replied in a low voice. 

“Oh! I have a better idea!” she exclaimed, her dark eyes lighting up 
mischievously. 

“Uh-oh,” Evan moaned. 

“Slip a little glob of it in that guy Conan’s lunch tomorrow. When he starts 
to grow as big as a hippo, everyone will see that the Monster Blood is real.” 

“No way!” Evan cried. He cupped the blue can in both hands, as if 
protecting it from Andy. “Conan is already big enough!” he told her, taking a 
step back. “I don’t want him to grow another inch. Do you know what he could 
do to me if he became a giant?” 

Andy laughed and shrugged. “It was just an idea.” 

“A bad idea,” Evan said sharply. “A really bad idea.” 

“You’re no fun,” she teased. She leaped forward and tried to wrestle the can 
from his hands. 

He spun around, turning his back to her, and hunched over, protecting the 

can. 

“Give it to me!” she cried, laughing. She started tickling his sides. “Give it! 
Give it!” 



“No!” he protested, breaking free. He ran to the safety of a tall evergreen 
shrub. 

“It’s mine!” Andy declared, coming after him, hands at her waist. “If you’re 
not going to use it, hand it back.” 

Evan stood his ground. His expression turned serious. “Andy, don’t you 
remember?” he demanded shrilly. “Don’t you remember how scary this stuff 
was? Don’t you remember how dangerous it was? All the trouble it caused?” 

“So?” she replied, her eyes on the blue can. 

“We have to get rid of it,” Evan told her firmly. “We can’t let it out of the 
can. It will grow and grow and never stop.” 

“But I thought you wanted to show it to the kids to prove that it’s real.” 

“No,” Evan interrupted. “I changed my mind. This stuff is too dangerous. 
We have to get rid of it.” He locked his eyes on hers, his features tight with fear. 
“Andy, I’ve had nightmares every night because of this stuff. I don’t want any 
new nightmares.” 

“Okay, okay,” she muttered. She kicked at an upraised tree root. Then she 
handed him the brown paper bag. 

Evan clicked the top back on the can of Monster Blood. Then he shoved the 
can into the bag. “Now how do we get rid of it?” he wondered out loud. 

“I know. Dump it in the creek,” Andy suggested. 

Evan shook his head. “No good. What if it gets out and pollutes the creek?” 

“This creek is already polluted!” Andy exclaimed. “It’s just a big mud 
puddle!” 

“It isn’t deep enough,” Evan insisted. “Someone will find the can and pull it 
out. We can’t take a chance.” 

“Then how do we get rid of it?” Andy asked, twisting her face in 
concentration. “Hmmmm. We could eat it ourselves. That would get rid of it!” 

“Very funny,” Evan muttered, rolling his eyes. 

“Just trying to be helpful,” Andy said. 

“You’re about as helpful as a toothache!” Evan shot back. 

“Ha-ha. Remind me to laugh at that sometime,” she replied, sticking her 
tongue out at him. 

“How can we get rid of it?” Evan repeated, gripping the bag in both hands. 
“How?” 

“I know!” a boy’s voice called, startling them both. 

Conan Barber stepped out from behind a tall shrub. 



“You can give it to me!” he declared. He reached out a big, powerful- 
looking hand to grab the bag. 



10 


Evan swung the paper bag behind his back. 

Conan lumbered toward them over the tall grass. His eyes were narrowed 
menacingly at Evan. 

How long has he been hiding there? Evan wondered. Did he hear us talk 
about the Monster Blood? Is that why he wants the bag? 

“Hi, I’m Andy,” Andy chirped brightly. She stepped in between the two 
boys and flashed Conan a smile. 

“Andy is a boy’s name,” Conan said, making a disgusted face. He turned 
his hard stare on her, challenging her. 

“And what kind of a name is Conan?” Andy shot back, returning his stare. 

“You know me?” Conan asked, sounding surprised. 

“You’re famous,” Andy replied dryly. 

Conan suddenly remembered Evan. He stuck out his big paw. “I’ll take the 
bag now.” 

“Why should I give it to you?” Evan demanded, trying to keep his voice 
calm and steady. 

“Because it’s mine,” Conan lied. “I dropped it here.” 

“You dropped an empty bag here?” Evan asked. 

Conan swatted a fly from his blond hair. “It isn’t empty. I saw you put 
something in it. Hand it over. Now.” 

“Well... okay.” Evan handed him the paper bag. Conan eagerly reached 
inside. 

His hand came out empty. 

He peered inside the bag. Empty. 

He stared hard at Andy, then at Evan. 

“I told you it was empty,” Evan said. 

“Guess I made a mistake,” Conan muttered. “Hey, no hard feelings. Shake.” 
Conan reached out his big right hand to Evan. 

Evan reluctantly stuck out his hand. 

Conan slid his hand over Evan’s and began to tighten his grip. Harder. 
Harder. 



Evan’s fingers cracked so loudly, they sounded like a tree falling! 

Conan squeezed Evan’s hand harder and harder until Evan screamed in 
pain. When Conan finally let go, the hand looked like a slab of raw hamburger. 

“Nice handshake you got there!” Conan exclaimed, grinning. 

He snapped his finger against Andy’s nose, then headed off quickly toward 
the street, taking long strides, laughing to himself. 

“Great guy,” Andy muttered, rubbing her nose. 

Evan blew on his hand, as if trying to put out a fire. “Maybe I can learn to 
be left-handed,” he murmured. 

“Hey—where’s the Monster Blood?” Andy demanded. 

“I—I dropped it,” Evan replied, still examining his hand. 

“Huh?” She kicked away a clump of weeds and stepped over to him. 

“I thought I could shove the can into my back jeans pocket while Conan 
was talking to you,” Evan explained. “But it slipped out of my hand. I dropped 
it.” 

He turned, bent over, and picked it up from the tall grass. “Good thing it 
didn’t roll or anything. Conan would have seen it.” 

“He wouldn’t know what to do with it if he had it,” Andy said. 

“What are we going to do with it?” Evan demanded. “It’s already caused us 
trouble. We’ve got to hide it, or throw it away, or—or—” 

He pulled open the lid. “Oh, wow! Look!” He held the can up to Andy’s 
face. The green goo had grown nearly to the top of the can. “It’s starting to grow 
a lot faster. I guess because we exposed it to the air.” 

Evan slammed the lid on tight. 

“Let’s bury it,” Andy suggested. “Here. Right under this tree. We’ll dig a 
deep hole and bury it.” 

Evan liked the idea. It was simple and quick. 

They squatted down and began digging with their hands. The dirt beneath 
the tree was soft. The hole grew deep before they had worked up a sweat. 

Evan dropped the blue can of Monster Blood into the hole. Then they 
quickly covered it with dirt, smoothing it out until it was impossible to tell a hole 
had been dug. 

“This was a good plan,” Andy said, climbing to her feet, playfully wiping 
the dirt off her hands on the back of Evan’s T-shirt. “If we need it, we’ll know 
where it is.” 

Evan’s red hair was matted to his forehead with sweat. He had a wide smear 



of dirt across his freckled forehead. “Huh? Why would we need it?” he 
demanded. 

Andy shrugged. “You never know.” 

“We won’t need it,” Evan told her firmly. “We won’t.” 

He was very, very wrong. 



11 


“Hey, Dad, what’s up?” Evan stepped into the garage. 

Mr. Ross stopped hammering and turned around. He smiled at Evan. “Want 
to see my newest work?” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Evan replied. Every weekend, his father spent hour after hour 
in his garage workshop, banging away on large sheets of metal, making what he 
called his “works”. 

He chiseled and hammered and sawed, and put a lot of effort into his 
sculptures. But to Evan, they all looked like banged-up sheets of metal when 
they were finished. 

Mr. Ross took a few steps back to admire his current project. He lowered 
his heavy mallet in one hand and pointed with the chisel he held in his other 
hand. “I used brass for this one,” he told Evan. “I call it ‘Autumn Leaf’.” 

Evan studied it thoughtfully. “It looks like a leaf,” he lied. It looks like Dad 
mined a perfectly good piece of brass, he thought, trying to keep a straight face. 

“It’s not supposed to look like a leaf,” Mr. Ross corrected Evan. “It’s 
supposed to look like my impression of a leaf.” 

“Oh.” Evan scratched his curly, red hair as he studied it some more. “Neat, 
Dad,” he said. “I see what you mean.” 

Then something else caught his eye. “Hey—what’s this?” 

Evan carefully stepped over several jagged, bent shards of metal. He made 
his way to another metal sculpture and ran his hand over the smooth, shiny 
surface. It was an enormous aluminum cylinder that rested above a flat wooden 
base. 

“Go ahead. Spin it,” Mr. Ross instructed, smiling proudly. 

Evan pushed the cylinder with both hands. It spun slowly over the wooden 

base. 

“I call it ‘The Wheel’,” his father told him. 

Evan laughed. “That’s cool, Dad. You invented the wheel!” 

“Don’t laugh!” Mr. Ross replied, grinning. “That sculpture was accepted at 
the annual arts competition at your school. I have to take it to the auditorium 
later this week.” 

Evan gave “The Wheel” another spin. “I’ll bet no one else made a wheel 



that really spins,” he told his father. “You can’t lose with this, Dad,” he teased. 

“Sarcasm is the lowest form of humor,” Mr. Ross muttered with a frown. 

Evan said good-bye and made his way out of the garage, stepping carefully 
over the jagged pieces of brass and tin. As he headed to the house, he could hear 
the clang clang clang as his dad hammered away on his impression of a leaf. 

In the halls after school on Monday, Evan hurried around a corner and bumped 
right into Andy. “I can’t talk now,” he told her breathlessly. “I’m late for 
basketball tryouts.” 

He glanced down the long hall. It was nearly empty. The gym door opened, 
and he could hear the thump of basketballs against the floor. 

“How come you’re late?” Andy demanded, blocking his path. 

“Murphy kept me after class,” Evan told her with a groan. “He put me on 
permanent hamster duty. I have to take care of Cuddles every afternoon for the 
rest of my life.” 

“Bad news,” Andy murmured. 

“No. That’s the good news,” Evan replied bitterly. 

“What’s the bad news?” 

“The bad news is that Mr. Murphy is also the basketball coach!” 

“Well, good luck,” she said. “Hope you make the team.” 

Evan ran past her, his heart pounding. 

Mr. Murphy is such a rat, he thought unhappily. He’ll probably keep me off 
the team because I’m late to practice—even though it’s his fault I’m late! 

Evan took a deep breath. No. Stop thinking like that, he scolded himself. 

Think positive. I’ve got to think positive. 

Sure, I’m not as tall as the other guys. Maybe I’m not as big or as strong. 
But I’m a good basketball player. And I can make this team. 

I can make this team. I know I can! 

Having finished his pep talk to himself, Evan pulled open the double gym 
doors and stepped into the huge, brightly lit gym. 

“Think fast!” a voice called. 

Evan felt his face explode with pain. 

Then everything went black. 



12 


When Evan opened his eyes, he found himself staring up at about twenty guys 
and Mr. Murphy. 

He was stretched out fiat on his back on the gym floor. His face still hurt. A 
lot. 

He reached a hand up and touched his nose. To his dismay, it felt like a 
wilted leaf of lettuce. 

“You okay, Evan?” Mr. Murphy asked quietly. As the teacher leaned over 
Evan, the whistle that was on a string around his neck bumped against Evan’s 
chest. 

“Did my face explode?” Evan asked weakly. 

Some of the guys snickered. Mr. Murphy glowered at them angrily. Then he 
turned back to Evan. “Conan hit you in the face with the basketball,” he 
reported. 

“He’s got bad reflexes, Coach,” Evan heard Conan say from somewhere 
above him. “He should’ve caught the ball. I really thought he’d catch it. But he’s 
got bad reflexes.” 

“I saw the whole thing,” Conan’s friend, a huge hulk of a kid named Biggie 
Malick, chimed in. “It wasn’t Conan’s fault. Evan should’ve caught the ball. It 
was a perfect pass.” 

Perfect, Evan thought with a sigh. He touched his nose again. This time, it 
felt like a lump of mashed potatoes. At least it isn’t broken, he thought glumly. 

Evan’s basketball tryout went downhill from there. 

Mr. Murphy helped him to his feet. “You sure you want to try out?” he 
asked. 

Thanks for the support, Evan thought bitterly. 

“I think I can make the team,” he said. 

But Conan, Biggie, and the other guys had other ideas. 

During the ball-handling tryout, Evan confidently began dribbling across 
the floor. Halfway to the basket, Biggie bumped him hard—and Conan stole the 
ball away. 

They blocked Evan’s shots. They stole his passes. 

They bumped him every time he moved, sending him sprawling to the 



hardwood floor again and again. 

A fast pass from Conan caught Evan in the mouth. 

“Oops! Sorry!” Conan yelled. 

Biggie laughed like a hyena. 

“Defense! I want to see defense!” Mr. Murphy shouted from the sidelines. 

Evan lowered himself into a defensive stance. As Conan dribbled the ball 
toward him, Evan prepared to defend the basket. 

Conan drove closer. Closer. 

Evan raised both hands to block Conan’s shot. 

But to Evan’s surprise, Conan let the ball bounce away. In one swift motion, 
he grabbed Evan by the waist, leaped high in the air, and stuffed Evan into the 
basket. 

“Three points!” Conan shouted in triumph. 

Biggie and the other guys rushed to congratulate Conan, laughing and 
cheering. 

Mr. Murphy had to get a stepladder to help Evan down. 

His hand on Evan’s shoulder, the teacher led him to the side. “You’re just 
not tall enough, Evan,” he said, rubbing his pink chins. “Don’t take it personally. 
Maybe you’ll grow. But for now, you’re just not tall enough.” 

Evan didn’t say a word. He lowered his head and sadly slumped out of the 

gym. 

Conan came running up to him at the door. “Hey, Evan, no hard feelings,” 
he said. He stuck out his big, sweaty hand. “Shake.” 

Evan held up his hand to show Andy. “It looks like a wilted petunia,” she said. “I 
can’t believe I fell for Conan’s stupid handshake trick twice!” Evan wailed. It 
was the next afternoon. Evan and Andy had walked from school to the small 
park near their houses. Evan had complained about Mr. Murphy and Conan and 
the other basketball players the whole way. 

The late afternoon sun beamed down on them as they walked. Andy 
stopped to watch two monarch butterflies, their black-and-gold wings fluttering 
majestically as they hovered over a patch of blue and yellow wildflowers along 
the creekbed. 

Even the trickling brown creek looked pretty on this bright day. Tiny white 
gnats sparkled like diamonds in the sunlight over the shimmering water. 

Evan kicked at a fallen tree branch. Everything looked dark to him today. 



Dark and ugly. 

“It just wasn’t fair,” he grumbled, kicking the branch again. “It wasn’t a fair 
tryout. Mr. Murphy should have given me a better chance.” 

Andy tsk-tsked, her eyes on the sparkling creek. 

“Someone should teach Mr. Murphy a lesson,” Evan said. “I wish I could 
think of some way of paying him back. I really do.” 

Andy turned to him. A devilish grin crossed her face. “I have a plan,” she 
said softly. “A really neat plan.” 

“What is it?” Evan demanded. 



13 


“What’s your idea?” Evan demanded again. 

Andy grinned at him. She was wearing a long, lime-green T-shirt over a 
Day-Glo orange T-shirt, pulled down over baggy blue shorts. The sunlight made 
all the colors so bright, Evan felt like shielding his eyes. 

“You might not like it,” Andy said coyly. 

“Try me,” Evan replied. “Come on. Don’t keep me in suspense.” 

“Well...” Her eyes wandered over to the tree where they had buried the 
Monster Blood. “It has to do with the Monster Blood,” she said reluctantly. 

He swallowed hard. “That’s okay. Go on.” 

“Well, it’s a pretty simple plan. First, we dig up the Monster Blood,” Andy 
said, watching his reaction. 

“Yeah?” 

“Then we take some to school,” she continued. 

“Yeah?” 

“Then we feed it to Cuddles.” 

Evan’s mouth dropped open. 

“Just a little bit!” Andy quickly explained. “We feed Cuddles a tiny glob of 
it. Just enough to make him the size of a dog.” 

Evan laughed. It was a terrible idea, a truly evil idea—but he loved it! 

He slapped Andy on the back. “You’re bad, Andy!” he cried. “You’re really 
bad!” 

Andy grinned proudly. “I know.” 

Evan laughed again. “Can you see the look on Murphy’s face when he 
comes in and sees his precious little hamster has grown as big as a cocker 
spaniel? What a riot!” 

“So you’ll do it?” Andy asked. 

Evan’s smile faded. “I guess,” he replied thoughtfully. “If you promise 
we’ll only use a tiny bit. And we’ll bury the rest right away.” 

“Promise,” Andy said. “Just enough to play our little joke on Mr. Murphy. 
Then we’ll never use the stuff again.” 

“Okay,” Evan agreed. 



They shook hands solemnly. 

Then they hurried to the tree. Evan searched the entire park, squinting 
against the bright sunlight. He wanted to make sure no one was spying on them 
this time. 

When he was sure the park was empty, he and Andy dropped to their knees 
under the tree and began scooping the dirt off the hole with their hands. 

They had dug nearly two feet down when they realized the hole was empty. 

“The Monster Blood!” Evan cried. “It—it’s gone!” 



14 


“We must be digging under the wrong tree,” Evan said, sweat pouring down his 
freckled forehead. 

Andy pushed a wet strand of brown hair off her face with a dirt-covered 
finger. “No way.” She shook her head. “This is the right tree. And the right 
hole.” 

“Then where is the Monster Blood?” Evan demanded shrilly. 

They both came up with the answer to his question at the same time: 
“Conan!” 

“He must have watched us bury it,” Evan said, his eyes darting around the 
park as if he expected to see Conan jump out from behind a bush. “I thought he 
hurried away awfully fast that afternoon. He knew the paper bag wasn’t empty.” 

Andy agreed. “He hid and watched us bury it. Then he waited till we were 
gone, and dug it up.” 

They both stared into the empty hole in horrified silence. 

Andy broke the silence. “What is Conan going to do with it?” she asked, 
her voice just above a whisper. 

“Probably eat it so he can grow bigger and pound me harder,” Evan replied 
bitterly. 

“But he doesn’t know what Monster Blood does,” Andy said. “He doesn’t 
know how dangerous it is.” 

“Of course he does. I told him all about it,” Evan replied. He slammed his 
hand against the tree trunk. “We have to get it back!” 

Before science class the next afternoon, Evan found Conan in the hall. He and 
Biggie were standing next to Evan’s locker. They were laughing loudly about 
something, slapping each other high-fives. 

Conan wore a tight blue muscle shirt and baggy faded denim jeans with 
enormous holes at the knees. Biggie had wavy brown hair down to his shoulders. 
He wore a sleeveless white T-shirt and tight-fitting black denims. 

They look like a couple of tag-team wrestlers! Evan thought as he stepped 
between them. 

“Hey, look—it’s Air Evan!” Conan joked. “King of the slam dunk!” 



He and Biggie guffawed loudly. Conan gave Evan a slap on the back that 
sent him sprawling into Biggie. 

“Uh... Conan? Did you find something in the park?” Evan asked, 
struggling to regain his balance. 

Conan narrowed his eyes at Evan and didn’t reply. 

“Did you find something that belongs to Andy and me?” Evan repeated. 

“You mean like your brains ?” Conan exclaimed. He and his tag-team 
partner roared with laughter over that gem. 

“Why don’t we dribble him to class?” Biggie asked Conan. “Coach Murphy 
would like to see us get in some extra practice.” 

Conan laughed gleefully at that idea. 

“Ha-ha. Very funny,” Evan said sarcastically. “Look, Conan—that stuff you 
took. It’s really dangerous. You have to give it back.” 

Conan opened his eyes in wide-eyed innocence. “I really don’t know what 
you’re talking about, Evan. Did you lose something?” 

“You know I lost something,” Evan replied sharply. “And I want it back.” 

Conan flashed a sly grin at Biggie. Then he turned back to Evan, his 
expression hardening. “I don’t know what you mean, Evan,” he said. “Really. I 
don’t know what you and that girl lost. But tell you what. I’m a nice guy. I’ll 
help you look for it.” 

He grabbed Evan around the waist with both hands. Biggie pulled Evan’s 
locker door open. 

“I’ll help you look for it in your locker,” Conan said. 

He shoved Evan inside the locker and slammed the door shut. 

Evan started pounding on the metal door, shouting for help. 

But the bell had rung. Evan knew the hall was empty. There was no one to 
hear his cries. 

He decided to try fiddling with the latch. But it was too dark to see 
anything. And he was so jammed in, he couldn’t raise his arms. 

Finally, two girls happened to walk by, and they pulled open the locker 

door. 

Evan came bursting out, red-faced, gasping for air. 

The girls’ laughter followed him all the way to Mr. Murphy’s class. “You’re 
late,” the teacher said sternly, glancing up at the wall clock as Evan staggered in. 

Evan tried to explain why. But all that escaped his lips was a whistling 
wheeze. 



“I’m really tired of you disrupting my class, Evan,” Mr. Murphy said, 
rubbing his nearly bald head. “I’m afraid I’ll be seeing you after school again. 
You can give Cuddles’ cage a double cleaning. And while you’re at it, you can 
scrub the chalkboards and clean out all the test tubes, too.” 


* * * 


“It’s so dark,” Evan whispered. 

“It usually gets dark at night,” Andy replied, rolling her eyes. 

“The streetlight is out,” Evan said, pointing. “And there’s no moon tonight. 
That’s why it’s so dark.” 

“Hide! ” Andy whispered. 

They ducked behind the hedge as a car rolled slowly past. Evan shut his 
eyes as the white headlights moved over him. When the car turned the corner, 
they climbed to their feet. 

It was a little after eight o’clock. They were standing in the street in front of 
Conan’s house. Leaning against the low hedge, they stared across the sloping 
front lawn into the large picture window in the front of the house. 

The lamp in the living room was lit, casting a dim rectangle of orange light 
that spilled onto the front yard. The old trees at the sides of the small brick house 
whispered in a hot breeze. 

“Are we really doing this?” Evan asked, huddling close to Andy. “Are we 
really going to break into Conan’s house?” 

“We’re not going to break in,” Andy whispered. “We’re going to sneak in.” 

“But what if the Monster Blood isn’t there?” Evan asked, hoping she 
couldn’t see his knees trembling. 

“We have to look, don’t we?” Andy shot back. 

She turned to study his face. He saw that she was frightened, too. “The 
Monster Blood will be there,” she told him. “It’s got to be.” 

Bending low, she started to creep across the dark yard to the house. 

Evan hung back. “You checked it out?” he called to her. “Everyone is really 
gone?” 

“His parents left right after dinner,” Andy told him. “Then I saw Conan go 
out about ten minutes ago,” 

“Where?” Evan demanded. 

“How should I know?” she asked sharply, putting her hands on her waist. 



“He left. The house is empty.” She came back and tugged Evan’s arm. “Come 
on. Let’s sneak into Conan’s room, get the Monster Blood, and get out of here!” 

“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Evan said, sighing. “We—we could be 
arrested!” 

“It was your idea!” Andy reminded him. 

“Oh. Yeah. Right.” He took a deep breath and held it, hoping it would help 
calm him down. “If we don’t find it right away, we get out of there—right?” 

“Right,” Andy agreed. “Now come on.” She gave him a little shove toward 
the house. 

They took a few steps over the dew-wet grass. 

They both stopped when they heard the low barking. 

Andy grabbed Evan’s arm. 

The barking grew louder. They could hear the dog’s heavy paws pounding 
the ground, approaching fast. 

Two angry eyes. A loud warning bark. Another. 

The dog attacked at full speed. 

“Run!” Evan cried. “Conan has a guard dog!” 

“Too late to run!” Andy shrieked. 



15 


The dog barked again. 

Evan cried out and threw up his hands as the dog leaped for his throat. 

The dog wasn’t as big as Evan had thought—but it was strong. 

It licked his face, pressing its wet snout into his cheek. 

It licked his chin. And then his lips. 

“Yuck!” Evan cried, laughing. “Trigger—how did you get here?” 

Evan pulled the cocker spaniel off him and lowered it to the ground. Its 
stubby tail wagging furiously, Trigger started jumping on Andy. 

“Your dumb dog scared me to death,” she moaned. 

“Me, too,” Evan admitted. “I didn’t hear him following us, did you?” 

Andy squatted down and gave Trigger a few quick pats. Then she glanced 
down the street. 

“Let’s get inside,” she said. “Conan or his parents could be back any 
minute.” 

Trigger pranced along as they made their way over the grass to the front 
door. The house loomed much bigger and darker as they crept onto the stoop. 

“Down, Trigger. Stay down,” Evan whispered. “You can’t come in with us.” 

Andy tried the front door. “Locked.” 

Evan groaned. “Now what?” 

“We try the back door, of course,” Andy replied. She had already jumped 
down off the stoop and was heading around the side of the house. 

“You’ve done this before—haven’t you?” Evan demanded, following her. 

“Maybe,” she replied, grinning at him in the dark. 

A loud howl somewhere nearby made them both stop. 

“What was that?” Evan cried. 

“A werewolf,” Andy told him calmly. “Or maybe a cat.” 

They both laughed. Nervous laughter. 

The back door was locked, too. But the kitchen window was open a crack. 
Evan pushed it open wider, and they crept into the dark kitchen. 

Holding his breath, Evan could hear every sound. Their sneakers scraped 
noisily against the linoleum. The refrigerator hummed. Water swirled in the 



dishwasher. 

I can even hear the pounding of my heart, Evan thought. What am I doing? 
Have I really broken into Conan’s house? 

“This way,” Andy whispered. “His room is probably upstairs.” 

Evan kept against the wall as he followed Andy to the front stairs. They 
passed the small living room, bathed in orange light. The floorboards creaked 
under their shoes. Evan stumbled over a pile of old newspapers stacked in the 
narrow hallway. 

Up the wooden stairs. The banister squeaked under Evan’s hand. A 
Venetian blind rattled against an open window, startling him. 

“Sure is dark,” Andy muttered as they reached the top of the stairs. 

Evan tried to reply, but his breath caught in his throat. 

Holding onto the wall, he followed Andy to the first bedroom. She fumbled 
until she found a light switch, then clicked it on. The ceiling light revealed that 
they had found Conan’s room. 

They both stood in the doorway, waiting for their eyes to adjust to the light. 
Then they quickly glanced around. 

The walls of the small, square room were filled with posters of sports stars. 
The biggest poster, above Conan’s bed, showed Michael Jordan jumping about 
ten feet in the air as he slam-dunked a basketball. A bookshelf against one wall 
held very few books—but was loaded with sports trophies that Conan had won 
on various teams. 

Suddenly, Andy started to laugh. 

Evan turned to her, startled. “What’s so funny?” 

She pointed to Conan’s bed. “Look—he still has a teddy bear!” 

Evan turned his eyes to the bed, where a forlorn-looking, nearly flat, one- 
eyed teddy bear rested on the pillow. “Conan the Barbarian?” he cried, laughing. 
“He sleeps with a teddy bear?” 

A loud creak made them cut their laughter short. 

They listened hard, their eyes wide with fear. “Just the house,” Evan 
whispered. 

Andy shivered. “Enough fooling around. Let’s find the Monster Blood and 
get out of here.” 

They moved into the center of the room. “Where do you think he hid it?” 
Evan asked, pulling open the closet door. 

“He didn’t,” Andy replied. 



“Huh?” Evan spun around. 

Andy had the blue can of Monster Blood in her hand. Grinning, she held it 
up to show Evan. 

Evan let out a surprised cry. “You found it? Where?” 

“Right on this shelf,” she replied, pointing. “He put it next to his tennis 
trophies.” 

Evan hurried over to her and took the blue can from her hand. As he held it 
up to examine it, the lid popped off. 

The green Monster Blood began bubbling over the top of the can. 

“It’s growing fast!” Evan declared. 

Andy stooped down and picked up the lid. She handed it to Evan. “Put it 
back on. Hurry.” 

Evan tried pushing the lid back on. It kept slipping off. 

“Hurry up,” Andy urged. “We’ve got to go.” 

“The Monster Blood—it’s up over the top,” Evan cried. 

“Shove it down,” Andy instructed. 

Evan tried pushing the green gunk down into the can, pressing against it 
with the palm of his hand. Then he tried pushing it with three fingers. 

He gasped as he felt the green goo tighten around his fingers and start to 
pull them down. 

“It—it’s got me!” Evan stammered. 

Andy’s mouth dropped open. “Huh?” 

“It’s got my fingers!” Evan cried shrilly. “It won’t let go!” 

As Andy hurried to help him, they both heard the front door slam. 

“Someone’s home!” Evan whispered, tugging to pull his fingers free. 
“We’re caught!” 



16 


Andy froze in the center of the room, her eyes wide with horror. 

Evan nearly dropped the can of Monster Blood. The sticky green substance 
tightened its grip on his fingers, making loud sucking sounds. 

But Evan only cared about the sounds coming from downstairs. 

“I’m home!” he heard Conan shout. 

“We’re home, too!” It was a woman’s voice, probably Conan’s mother. 

“They’re all home,” Evan whispered. 

“We’re dead meat!” Andy murmured. 

“I’m going upstairs,” Conan called to his parents. 

Evan let out a terrified cry as he heard Conan’s heavy footsteps on the 
stairs. “Andy—wh-what do we do?” he stammered. 

“The window!” she replied. 

They both lunged toward the open window and peered out. A narrow 
concrete ledge stretched just beneath the window. 

Without hesitating, Andy raised a leg over the windowsill and climbed out 
onto the ledge. “Evan—hurry!” she whispered, gesturing frantically. 

Evan was still desperately trying to pull his fingers from the bubbling green 
goo. Andy reached in through the window and grabbed him by the shoulder. 
“Evan—!” 

He heard Conan’s footsteps in the upstairs hall just outside the bedroom. 

Using his free hand for support, Evan scrambled out the window and joined 
Andy on the narrow ledge. 

“D-don’t look down,” Andy instructed in a trembling whisper. 

Evan didn’t obey. He glanced down. The ground seemed very far below. 

They each stood on a side of the window—Andy to the left, Evan the right. 
They pressed their bodies against the brick wall—and listened. 

They heard Conan step into the room. 

Did he notice that the light had been turned on? 

No way to tell. 

Loud rap music suddenly jarred the silence. Conan had turned on his boom 
box. He started chanting off-key along with the music. 



Evan pressed as tightly against the side of the house as he could. 

Go back downstairs, Conan, he pleaded silently. Please—go back 
downstairs! 

How will Andy and I ever get away from here? he wondered, feeling all of 
his muscles tighten in panic. 

Despite the hot night air, a cold chill ran down Evan’s back. He shuddered 
so hard, he nearly toppled off the ledge. 

The blue can stuck to his hand. The Monster Blood sucked at his fingers. 
But he couldn’t worry about that now. 

He could hear Conan moving around inside the room. Was he dancing to 
the loud music? 

Evan glanced across the window at Andy. Her eyes were shut. Her face was 
clenched in a tight frown. 

“Andy—!” Evan whispered. He knew that Conan couldn’t hear a whisper 
over the booming music. “Andy—it’ll be okay. As soon as he leaves, we’ll jump 
inside and sneak down the stairs.” 

Andy nodded without opening her eyes. “Did I ever tell you I’m afraid of 
heights?” she whispered. 

“No,” Evan replied. 

“Well, remind me to tell you!” 

“We’ll be okay,” he murmured. 

Clinging to the side of the house, Evan kept repeating those words to 
himself. “We’ll be okay. We’ll be okay. We’ll be okay.” 

Then Trigger started to bark. 

A low bark of surprise at first. And then a louder series of barks, insistent 
barks, excited barks. 

Evan swallowed hard. He glanced down to the ground. 

Trigger was peering up at him, jumping against the side of the house, as if 
trying to reach the ledge. The dog barked louder with each jump. 

“Trigger—no!” Evan called down in a frantic whisper. 

That only made the dog bark more furiously. 

Did Conan hear it? Could he hear Trigger’s ferocious barks over the music? 

“Trigger—stop! Go home! Go home!” 

Suddenly the music stopped. 

Trigger’s excited barks rose up even louder against the new silence. 

Conan must hear them now, Evan realized. 



The cocker spaniel threw himself wildly against the side of the house, 
trying to get up to Evan and Andy. Despite Evan’s frantic signals to be quiet, the 
dumb dog barked his head off. 

Evan’s breath caught in his throat as he heard Conan making his way to the 
window. 

A second later, Conan stuck his head out. “What’s going on?” he shouted. 

Evan’s knees buckled. He started to fall. 



17 


Evan clung to the brick wall and stopped his fall. 

He stared at Conan’s blond hair poking out the window. Evan was close 
enough to reach out and touch it. 

“Shut up down there!” Conan shouted. 

That made Trigger bark even louder. 

He’s going to see us, Evan thought, trembling all over. 

There’s no way Conan won’t see us. 

“Conan—come downstairs!” Mrs. Barber’s voice floated up from 
downstairs. “Conan—come down and have your cake and ice cream. You said 
you were dying for dessert!” she called. 

Conan’s head disappeared back into the bedroom. “There’s some stupid dog 
barking down there,” he called to his mother. 

Clinging to the side of the house, struggling to keep his quivering knees 
from buckling again, Evan shut his eyes and listened. 

He heard Conan’s footsteps cross the room. The bedroom light went out. 

Silence. 

“He—left,” Evan choked out. 

Andy let out a long breath. “I can’t believe he didn’t see us out here.” 

Evan glanced down to the ground. Trigger had finally stopped barking. But 
he continued to stand and stare up at them, his front paws against the side of the 
house, his stubby tail spinning like a propeller. 

“Dumb dog,” Evan muttered. 

“Let’s go,” Andy urged. She didn’t wait for Evan. She practically did a 
swan dive into the house. 

It took Evan a few moments to get his legs to work. Then he ducked his 
head and climbed through the window after Andy. 

Holding his breath, he led the way on tiptoe to the bedroom door. He 
stopped and listened. 

Silence. No one in the dark hallway. 

He could hear the Barbers’ voices downstairs in the kitchen. 

He and Andy made their way to the top of the stairs. Then, holding tightly 



to the banister, they crept halfway down. 

Evan stopped to listen again. Andy bumped right into him, nearly sending 
him sailing down the stairs. “Shhh!” she cried. 

They could hear Conan talking to his parents in the kitchen. He was 
complaining about the other guys on the basketball team. “They’re all wimps,” 
Evan heard Conan say. 

“Well, that’ll make you look even better,” Mr. Barber replied. 

Evan took another deep breath and held it. Then he made his way down to 
the bottom of the stairs. 

Almost out, he thought, his entire body shaking. Almost out of here. 

He reached for the front doorknob. 

“Conan, go upstairs and get your math book,” he heard Mr. Barber say. “I 
want to see the homework you had trouble with.” 

“Okay,” Conan replied. His chair scraped against the floor. 

Andy grabbed Evan’s shoulder. 

They stared in frozen horror at each other—one foot away from escape— 
and waited to be caught. 



18 


“Conan—don’t go now. Get the book later,” Mrs. Barber chimed in. Then they 
heard her scold Conan’s father: “Let the boy have his cake and ice cream.” 

“Fine, fine,” Mr. Barber replied. “He can show me the book later.” 

Conan’s chair scraped back into place under the table. 

Evan didn’t wait another second. 

He jerked open the front door, pushed open the screen door, and burst out of 
the house like a rocket. 

He could hear Andy gasping as she ran behind him. And then he could hear 
Trigger’s shrill yips as the dog followed, too. 

Down the Barbers’ front lawn, into the street. Their sneakers slapped the 
pavement as they ran full speed through the darkness. 

They didn’t stop until they reached Evan’s driveway. 

Evan leaned against his family’s mailbox and struggled to catch his breath. 
He raised his hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead—and saw the blue can still 
stuck there. 

“Help me,” he pleaded. He reached out his hand to Andy. 

She was breathing hard, too. Her eyes kept darting back down the street, as 
if she expected Conan to be chasing after them. 

“Close one,” she murmured. She turned to Evan. Her eyes glowed excitedly 
in the light from the streetlamp. “That was fun!” 

Evan didn’t agree. In his opinion, it was far too scary to be fun. And here he 
was, still stuck to the can of Monster Blood. 

He pushed his hand toward Andy. “Pull it off,” he told her. “I think you 
need both hands. I can’t do it.” 

She grabbed the can in both hands. The green gunk bubbled over the sides, 
making loud sucking sounds. 

Andy tugged. Then tugged harder. Then she took a deep breath, leaned 
back, and tugged with all her might. 

The Monster Blood finally let go of its grip on Evan’s fingers. The can slid 
off with a loud pop. Andy went tumbling back onto the pavement. 

“Ow!” Evan held up his three fingers and tried to examine them under the 
streetlight. They were all wrinkled and pruney, the way they looked when he had 



been swimming for an hour or two. 

“Yuck! That stuff is so gross!” he cried. 

Andy climbed slowly to her feet. She still cradled the Monster Blood can in 
both hands. “At least we got it back,” she murmured. 

“Yeah. Now we can bury it again,” Evan said, still examining his fingers. 
“Huh? Bury it?” Andy pulled the can away, as if protecting it from Evan. 
“You heard me,” Evan said firmly. “It’s just too dangerous to mess with, 
Andy. Take it home and bury it in your back yard, okay?” 

Andy stared down at the can. She didn’t reply. 

“Bury it,” Evan repeated. “Take it home and bury it. Promise?” 

“Well...” Andy hesitated. Then she said, “Okay. Promise.” 

Evan woke up with a bad sore throat the next morning. 

His mother worried that he might be coming down with the flu. So she kept 
him home from school. Evan spent the day reading comic books and watching 
MTV. His sore throat disappeared by midafternoon. 

He returned to school the next day, feeling refreshed and ready to see 
everyone. 

The good feeling lasted until he stepped into Mr. Murphy’s science class 
near the end of the day. Evan had to walk past the hamster cage to get to his seat. 
As he neared the cage, he peered in. 

That’s weird, he thought. Where’s Cuddles? 

When did Mr. Murphy get a rabbit? 

A rabbit?! 

He stopped and leaned closer to the cage. 

Familiar black eyes stared up at him. A familiar pink nose twitched at him. 

It was Cuddles, Evan realized. 

Cuddles had grown as big as a rabbit! 



19 


Evan leaned over the hamster cage, staring at the giant-sized Cuddles, as the bell 
rang. He turned to see that the other kids had all taken their seats. 

“Evan, I see you’re examining your victim,” Mr. Murphy said from the 
front of the room. 

“I—uh—” Evan couldn’t think of a reply. “Victim?” 

Mr. Murphy angrily narrowed his beady black eyes at Evan. “You’ve been 
overfeeding Cuddles, Evan. Look how fat he has become.” 

Almost as fat as you! Evan wanted to say. 

Evan knew that Cuddles’ weight problem wasn’t his fault. 

And it had nothing to do with overeating. 

Cuddles had grown to triple-hamster size because of Monster Blood. 

“When I find Andy, I’ll strangle her!” Evan muttered. 

“What did you say, Evan?” Mr. Murphy demanded. 

Evan could feel his face turning bright red. He hadn’t meant to talk out 

loud. 

“Uh... nothing,” he replied, totally embarrassed. He slunk to his seat. 

Andy has gone too far this time, he thought bitterly. She promised she’d 
bury the Monster Blood. She promised! 

And now she’s turned Cuddles into a fat freak! And Murphy thinks it’s all 
my fault! 

“Please stay after school,” Mr. Murphy told Evan, “so we can discuss 
Cuddles’ diet.” 

Evan heard some kids snickering. He knew they were laughing at him. 

He saw Conan and Biggie at their seats in the back. Conan was twitching 
his nose, puffing out his cheeks, pretending to be a fat hamster. Biggie was 
laughing his head off. 

Evan stared at the hamster all through class. Cuddles appeared to grow right 
before Evan’s eyes. With each breath, the hamster seemed to puff up wider and 
taller. 

Its black eyes were as big as marbles now. They stared back at Evan, as if 
accusing him. 

When the hamster moved to its water tube, the entire cage rattled and 



shook. 

Please don’t grow anymore! Evan pleaded silently, staring at the shaking 
cage. Please stop right now, Cuddles. Okay? 

The hamster breathed noisily. Wheezing gasps. Evan could hear Cuddles 
panting all the way across the room. 

The cage shook again as Cuddles turned around. Evan watched in horror as 
the cage nearly toppled off its table. 

I’ll kill Andy! Evan thought bitterly. How could she do this to me? 

When the bell rang, the other kids all gathered up their books and headed 
out the door. Evan stood up and walked over to Cuddles’ cage. 

Panting loudly, Cuddles stared up at him. He’s too big to fit on his wheel, 
Evan realized. If he grows any more, he’ll burst out of the cage! 

How much Monster Blood did Andy feed him? Evan wondered. He had to 
find out. 

He turned to Mr. Murphy, who was reading over some papers at his desk. 
“I’ve got to find someone,” Evan called up to him. “I’ll be right back.” 

“Don’t take too long,” the teacher replied without looking up. 

Evan hurried from the room—and ran into Conan. “Hey, I was looking for 
you,” Conan said, sidestepping to the right, then the left, and stretching out both 
arms to keep Evan from getting away. 

“No time now,” Evan said sharply. But Conan wouldn’t let him pass. “I’m 
kind of in a hurry,” Evan told him. “I don’t have time to be stuffed into my 
locker right now.” 

A big grin crossed Conan’s handsome face. “Hey, I’m sorry about that,” he 
said, his blue eyes twinkling. 

“Huh? You’re sorry?” Evan’s mouth dropped open in shock. 

“Yeah. No hard feelings,” Conan said, lowering his eyes. “Shake.” 

Evan stuck out his hand. Then remembered Conan’s crushing handshake. 
He tried to pull back his hand. 

Too late. 

Conan gripped it tightly and began to squeeze. As he squeezed Evan’s hand, 
his grin grew wider and wider. 

Down the hall, Evan saw Andy heading out the door. He tried to call to her. 
But all that came out of his mouth was a squeak of pain. 

Andy disappeared out the front door of the school. 

The bones in Evan’s hand cracked and crunched. 



When Conan finally let go, the hand looked like a sad lump of soft red clay. 

“Wow! That’s some handshake you’ve got!” Conan cried, laughing. He 
pretended his hand hurt. He shook it hard and blew on it. “You killed me that 
time! You been working out or something?” 

Conan headed off to basketball practice, laughing and shaking his hand. 

He really cracks himself up, Evan thought. An angry cry burst from his 
throat. He slammed his good hand into a locker. He was so furious, he thought 
he could feel steam pouring out his ears. 

“Evan—you’re keeping me waiting!” Mr. Murphy called in a singsong 
from the classroom doorway. 

“Coming,” Evan muttered miserably, and slunk back into the room. 

He tried calling Andy for hours that night. But there was no one home. 

In his sleep, he dreamed that Trigger ate a big glob of Monster Blood and 
grew to giant size. Evan tried to stop him. But the enormous dog took off after 
the mailman. 

It wasn’t much of a chase. Trigger caught the mailman easily. The mailman 
was the size of a hamster. 

Evan woke up drenched with sweat. He glanced at his bedtable clock. Only 
six in the morning. He normally didn’t get up until seven. 

He climbed out of bed, anyway, feeling shaky and scared. 

He decided he had to get to school before everyone else. He had to see if 
Cuddles had grown any bigger. 

“Evan—where are you going?” his mother called sleepily as Evan headed 
out the front door. 

“Uh—school,” Evan replied. He had hoped to sneak out before she woke 
up. 

“So early?” She padded into the room, struggling with the belt to her blue 
cotton robe. 

“Well... I have a science project I need to work on,” Evan told her. It was 
almost the truth. 

“A science project?” She eyed him suspiciously. 

“Yeah. It’s... big!” Evan replied, thinking quickly. “It’s really big! So I 
couldn’t bring it home.” 

“You’re going without any breakfast?” Mrs. Ross demanded, yawning. 

“I’ll grab something at school,” he said. “Later, Mom.” He disappeared out 



the door before she could ask any more questions. 

A red sun was just climbing over the trees in a gray sky. The air still carried 
the chill of the night. The lawns Evan passed shimmered wetly with morning 
dew. 

He jogged the whole way, his backpack flopping heavily on his shoulder. 
There were no other kids on the playground or on the walk heading into the 
building. 

He crept into the school and made his way down the silent, empty hall. His 
sneakers echoed loudly as he trotted toward the science classroom. 

Maybe Cuddles didn’t grow overnight, Evan told himself. 

Maybe he didn’t grow at all. Maybe he shrank. Maybe he shrank back to his 
old size. 

It was possible. 

It was possible that Andy had fed the hamster only a teeny tiny speck of 
Monster Blood. Just enough for Cuddles to swell up to the size of a fat rabbit— 
then shrink right back down to cute, cuddly hamster size. 

It was possible—wasn’t it? 

Yes! Yes! Evan crossed his fingers on both hands. He wished he could cross 
his toes. 

By the time he reached the classroom, he was breathless. His heart thudded 
loudly in his chest. 

He hesitated at the door. 

Please, Cuddles—be small. Be small! 

Then Evan took a deep breath, held it—and stepped inside. 



20 


Evan stepped into the room, staring at the cage against the far wall. At first, he 
didn’t see Cuddles. 

Had Cuddles shrunk? Had he? 

Sometimes prayers are answered, Evan told himself. Sometimes good 
things happen. 

Evan took a few hesitant steps closer. Then a few more steps. 

Every muscle in his body had tensed. He was so frightened, it was actually 
hard to walk. 

He could feel the blood throbbing at his temples. He mopped the cold beads 
of sweat off his forehead. 

He still couldn’t see Cuddles. Where was he? 

Where? 

Gray morning light filtered in through the windows. The floor creaked 
under Evan’s sneakers. 

Evan took another hesitant step toward the cage. 

Another step. 

Then he cried out in horror. 

Evan hadn’t seen Cuddles at first—because Cuddles was too big! 

Cuddles filled the entire cage. 

Evan held back, gaping in disbelief. 

The hamster groaned noisily with every loud breath. It let out several 
disgusting grunts as its body pressed against the wire cage. 

Its big, furry head pushed up against the top of the cage. Evan could see one 
enormous black eye, the size of a jar lid, staring out at him. 

“No!” Evan cried out loud, feeling his knees begin to tremble. “This is 
impossible!” 

The hamster uttered a few more low grunts. 

The cage shook on its table. 

The big black eye glared out at Evan. 

And then as Evan stared in horrified disbelief, the hamster reached up its 
two pink paws. The toes slipped around the wires of the cage. 



Cuddles let out an ugly groan. 

Evan saw its spongy pink nose twitch. He saw a flash of big white teeth. 
Another groan. 

The two front paws pushed against the cage wires. 

The wires bent away. 

Cuddles grunted again, wheezing loudly, excitedly. 

He pushed the cage wires aside. Then he started to squeeze his big, fur- 
covered body through the opening. What do I do? Evan frantically asked 
himself. What do I do now? Cuddles is escaping! 



21 


“So what did you do?” Andy asked. 

They were sitting together in the tall grass of the tiny park, watching the 
brown creek trickle past. The late afternoon sun felt warm on their backs. 
Crickets chirped in the trees behind them. 

Three boys rolled past on bikes on the other side of the creek, heading 
home from school. One of them waved to Evan. He didn’t wave back. 

Andy wore a bright red sleeveless T-shirt over white denim jeans. She had 
slipped off her yellow sneakers and was digging her bare feet into the soft 
ground. 

“So what did you do?” she repeated. 

Evan picked up a hard clump of dirt and tossed it into the creek. Then he 
leaned back, his hands planted firmly behind him on the ground. 

“I got a dog leash,” he told Andy. “In the supply closet.” 

Andy’s eyes widened in surprise. “Murphy keeps a dog leash? What for?” 

Evan shrugged. “He has all kinds of junk back there.” 

“So you put the leash on Cuddles?” 

“Yeah,” Evan told her. “He was just the right size. As big as a dog. Maybe a 
little bigger.” 

“As big as Trigger?” Andy demanded. 

Evan nodded. “Then I tied the other end to the leg of Murphy’s desk—and I 
ran out of there as fast as I could.” 

Andy laughed. But she cut it short when she caught Evan’s angry glare. 
“What happened when you went to science class?” she asked, turning back to the 
creek. 

“I didn’t,” Evan muttered. 

“Huh?” 

“I didn’t go,” Evan said softly. “I was afraid to go. I didn’t want Murphy to 
start blaming me in front of everyone.” 

“So you cut class?” Andy asked, startled. 

Evan nodded. 

“So what did you do?” Andy asked. She pulled up a handful of the tall grass 
and let it sift through her fingers. 



“I sneaked out and came here,” Evan replied, frowning. 

“Everyone was talking about Cuddles all day,” Andy reported. Her dark 
eyes flashed. She couldn’t keep an amused grin off her face. “Everyone had to 
go in and see him. The stupid hamster practically caused a riot!” 

“It isn’t funny,” Evan murmured. 

“It’s kind of funny!” Andy insisted. “Mr. Murphy was bragging that 
Cuddles could beat up any other hamster in the country. He said he was going to 
try to get Cuddles on TV!” 

“Huh?” Evan jumped to his feet. “You mean Mr. Murphy wasn’t upset?” 

“I heard that he was at first,” Andy replied thoughtfully. “But then I guess 
he got used to Cuddles being so big. And he was acting kind of proud. You 
know. Like he had the biggest pumpkin at the fair or something. A blue-ribbon 
winner!” Andy snickered. 

Evan kicked at the grass. “I know he’s going to blame me. I know it!” 

“Everyone was feeding Cuddles carrots all day,” Andy said, not seeming to 
hear Evan’s unhappy wails. “The hamster ate the carrots whole. One big chomp. 
Then it made this really gross swallowing sound. It was a riot.” 

“I can’t believe this!” Evan groaned. He lowered his eyes angrily to Andy. 
“Why did you do it? Why?” 

Andy gazed up at him innocently. “I wanted to give you a laugh,” she 
replied. 

“Huh? A laugh?” he shrieked. 

“You were looking pretty down. I thought it might cheer you up.” 

Evan let out an angry cry. 

“I guess it didn’t cheer you up,” Andy muttered. 

She pulled up another handful of grass and let the blades fall over the legs 
of her white jeans. 

Evan stomped over to the edge of the creek. He kicked a rock into the 
water. 

“Come on, Evan,” Andy called. “You have to admit it’s a little funny.” 

He spun around to face her. “It’s not,” he insisted. “Not funny at all. What if 
Cuddles just keeps growing and growing? Then what?” 

“We could put a saddle on his back and give everyone hamster rides!” She 
giggled. 

Evan scowled and kicked another rock into the creek. “You know how 
dangerous that Monster Blood is,” he scolded. “What are we going to do? How 



are we going to get Cuddles back to hamster size?” 

Andy shrugged. She pulled up another handful of grass. 

The sun sank lower behind the trees. A shadow rolled over them. Two little 
kids chased a white-and-red soccer ball on the other side of the creek. Their 
mother shouted to them not to get wet. 

“Where’s the Monster Blood can?” Evan demanded, standing over Andy. 
“Maybe it tells the antidote on the can. Maybe it tells how to reverse the whole 
thing.” 

Andy shook her head. “Evan, you know it doesn’t say anything on the can. 
No instructions. No ingredients. Nothing.” She climbed to her feet and brushed 
off the legs of her jeans. “I’ve got to get home. My aunt doesn’t know where I 
am. She’s probably having a cow.” 

Evan followed her toward the street, shaking his head. “How big?” he 
muttered. 

She glanced back at him. “What did you say?” 

“How big will Cuddles be tomorrow?” Evan asked in a trembling voice. 
“How big?” 



22 


“Andy—will you hurry up?” 

Evan had agreed to meet Andy at her aunt’s house the next morning so they 
could go to school early. But Andy had found a spot on her jeans and had gone 
back up to her room to change. 

And now they were no longer early. 

“Sorry,” she said, hurtling down the stairs two steps at a time. She had 
changed her entire outfit. Now she had on a red-and-black-striped vest over a 
yellow T-shirt, pulled down over pale blue shorts. 

“Didn’t you leave out a color?” Evan demanded sarcastically, grabbing 
Andy’s backpack for her and hurrying to the front door. 

She made a face at him. “I like bright colors. It suits my personality.” 

“Your personality is late!” he declared. 

She followed him out the door and down the front lawn to the sidewalk. “At 
least I have a personality!” she cried. “What’s your hurry, anyway?” 

Evan didn’t answer. He adjusted his backpack on his shoulder, then began 
running toward school. 

“Hey—wait up!” Andy called, running after him. 

“How much Monster Blood did you give Cuddles, anyway?” Evan 
demanded without slowing his pace. “The whole can?” 

“No way!” Andy called breathlessly. “Just a spoonful. He seemed to like 
it.” 

“I guess he liked being as big as a dog, too,” Evan said, turning the corner. 
The tall, redbrick school building came into view. 

“Maybe he’s back to normal today,” Andy said. 

But as they came near the building, it was easy to tell that things were not 
normal. 

Evan heard a loud crash from the side of the building. It sounded like glass 
shattering. 

Then he heard excited shouts. Loud kids’ voices filled with alarm. 

“What’s going on?” Andy cried. 

They dove up the stairs and burst into the building. Running full speed, they 
turned the corner and made their way to the science classroom. 



Evan reached it a few steps ahead of Andy. Hearing excited shouts and 
cries, he lurched into the room—and then stopped with a startled cry. 

“No! Oh, please—no!” 

“Stand back! Everyone stand back!” a red-faced Mr. Murphy was 
screaming. 

Cuddles uttered a loud grunt and flailed his giant legs wildly in the air. 

“He—he’s ten feet tall!” Evan heard Andy scream at his side. 

“Al-almost!” Evan stammered. 

The grunting, groaning hamster towered over Mr. Murphy. Its pink paws 
batted the air. Its monstrous mouth opened wide, revealing two enormous, sharp 
white teeth. 

“Back! Everyone back!” Mr. Murphy shrieked. 

The terrified kids in the classroom pressed back against the walls. 

Mr. Murphy picked up a wooden chair in one hand, the torn dog leash in the 
other. Holding the chair by the back, he came at the grunting monster like a lion 
tamer. 

“Down, Cuddles! Get down! Sit! Sit!” 

He poked the wooden chair up at the giant hamster and snapped the dog 
leash like a whip. 

Cuddles’ watery black eyes, as big as soccer balls, glared down at the red¬ 
faced teacher. The hamster didn’t seem terribly impressed with Mr. Murphy’s 
lion-tamer act. 

“Down, Cuddles! Get down!” The teacher’s chins quivered, and his big 
belly bounced up and down beneath his tight gray knit polo shirt. 

Cuddles pulled back his huge lips and bared his white teeth. He let out a 
growl that made the light fixtures shake. 

Terrified cries rang out through the room. Evan glanced back to see a 
horrified crowd of teachers and students jammed in the doorway. 

“Down, Cuddles!” 

Mr. Murphy shoved the wooden chair up at the raging hamster. He cracked 
the dog-leash whip near the hamster’s throbbing, fur-covered belly. 

The huge black eyes stared down angrily at Mr. Murphy. The pink hamster 
paws clawed in the air. 

Andy grabbed Evan’s shoulder and held on tight. “This is terrible!” she 
cried. “Terrible!” 

Evan started to reply—but frightened shrieks drowned out his words. 



Cuddles grabbed the chair with both paws. 

“Drop! Drop!” Mr. Murphy screamed. He struggled to hold on to the chair. 

Cuddles pulled the chair. Mr. Murphy desperately held tight. He let the 
leash fall so he could hold on to the chair with both hands. 

The teacher and Cuddles had a short tug-of-war. 

Cuddles won easily. The hamster pulled the chair up, nearly jerking Mr. 
Murphy’s arms out of their sockets. 

With a loud groan, the teacher toppled heavily to the floor. 

Kids screamed. 

Two teachers rushed forward to help the gasping Mr. Murphy to his feet. 

Evan stared up as the hamster raised the wooden chair to its mouth. The 
enormous white teeth opened quickly. The pink nose twitched. The watery black 
eyes blinked. 

Then Cuddles chewed the wooden chair to pieces. 

Splinters rained down on the floor. 

The chomping teeth sounded like a lumberjack’s ax biting into a tree. 

Evan froze in horror along with everyone else in the room. 

Andy was squeezing his shoulder so hard, it hurt. “This is our fault,” she 
murmured. 

“Our fault?” Evan cried. “Our fault?” 

She ignored his sarcasm. He saw the fear in her eyes as she stared up at the 
hamster. Cuddles had turned the chair into toothpicks! 

“We’ve got to do something, Evan,” she whispered, huddled close to him. 

“But what?” Evan replied in a trembling voice. “What can we do?” 

Then, suddenly, he had an idea. 



23 


“Come with me!” Evan cried, tugging Andy’s arm. 

She hesitated, staring up at the giant hamster. “Where?” 

“I have an idea,” Evan told her. “But we have to hurry!” 

Cuddles lumbered over to Mr. Murphy’s desk. The hamster’s heavy 
footsteps made the floor sag. 

“Here, fella! Here!” Mr. Murphy was tossing handfuls of sunflower seeds 
up to Cuddles. Cuddles glared down at him. The seeds were too small to bother 
with. 

“Hurry!” Evan pleaded. He pulled Andy through the frightened crowd of 
kids and teachers at the door. Then he began running full speed toward the 
auditorium. 

“We can’t just run away! We have to do something!” Andy cried. 

“We’re not running away,” Evan called back to her, turning a corner. “My 
father’s sculpture—it’s in the auditorium.” 

“Huh?” Andy’s eyes narrowed in confusion. “Evan—have you totally lost 
it? Why do you want to look at your father’s sculpture now?” 

He burst through the auditorium doors and ran past the dark rows of seats 
toward the stage. Several pieces of sculpture had been set up there. 

“Evan—I don’t get it!” Andy cried, right behind him. 

“Look,” Evan said breathlessly. He pointed to his father’s work near the 
back of the stage. “My dad’s sculpture. It’s just like a hamster wheel—see?” 

Her mouth dropped open as she stared at it. 

“It’s a big metal wheel and it spins,” Evan explained as they pulled 
themselves up onto the stage. “Come on. Help me drag it back to Murphy’s 
room. It’s big enough for Cuddles.” 

“Whoa!” Andy cried. “You want to bring Cuddles a wheel? What for?” 

“To distract him,” Evan replied, grabbing one side of the big sculpture. “If 
we can get Cuddles running on this wheel, it will give us time to figure out 
where to keep him. And it will stop him from chewing the whole school to 
pieces.” 

Andy grabbed hold of the other side, one hand on the wheel, one hand on 
the platform. “Maybe Cuddles will mn so hard, he’ll lose weight. Maybe he’ll 



shrink back to his normal size,” she said. 

Luckily, the platform was on wheels. They rolled the sculpture toward the 
stage door at the side. “I just want to distract him,” Evan said, tugging hard. “I 
just want to give us time to think, to make a plan.” 

“Wow! This is heavy!” Andy cried. They rolled it into the hall. “Heavy 
enough for Cuddles, I guess.” 

“I hope,” Evan replied solemnly. 

By the time they rolled the sculpture to the classroom, the crowd of 
frightened kids and teachers had grown even bigger. “Make way! Make way!” 
they both shouted, pushing their way through the crowd. 

They set the wheel down in the center of the floor and gazed over at 
Cuddles. The hamster had two teachers cornered, their backs pressed against the 
chalkboard. It was gnashing its huge teeth at them, slapping its pink paws 
together as if eager to fight them. 

Evan gasped when he saw Mr. Murphy’s desk, crushed flat on the floor. 

“I—I called the police! ” Mr. Murphy cried, his face beaded with large drops 
of sweat. “I begged them to come. But when I said it was a giant hamster, they 
didn’t believe me! They thought it was a practical joke!” 

“Stand back, everyone!” Evan cried shrilly. “Stand back—please! Let 
Cuddles see the wheel!” 

The giant hamster turned suddenly. The two teachers scrambled away from 
the wall. Kids and teachers screamed and hurried toward the door. 

“Maybe he’ll run on the wheel for a while,” Andy explained to Mr. Murphy. 
“Then we can figure out what to do with him!” 

“He—he sees it!” Mr. Murphy cried breathlessly, all of his chins quivering 
at once. 

Cuddles stared down at the wheel. His stub of a tail thudded loudly against 
the chalkboard. He dropped heavily to all fours and took a lumbering step 
toward the wheel. 

“He sees it. He’s going to it,” Evan murmured softly. 

A hush fell over the room as everyone stared at the hamster. 

Will Cuddles climb inside? Evan wondered, holding his breath. 

Will he run on the wheel? 

Will my plan work? 



24 


The hamster sniffed the wheel. Its pink nose twitched. It uttered a low grunt. 

Then it raised itself back onto its hind legs. The hamster’s massive shadow 
fell over the room. 

With another disgusting grunt, it picked the sculpture up in its front paws 
and raised it to its face. 

“No!” Evan cried. “Cuddles—no!” 

The metal clanged as Cuddles bit into the wheel. Evan saw deep tooth 
marks in the aluminum. Cuddles bit down again. Then, seeing that he couldn’t 
chew the wheel up, he pulled it apart, holding the sculpture in his paws and 
twisting it furiously with his teeth. 

Then he tossed the mangled wheel away. It slammed into a window, 
shattering it into a thousand pieces. 

“Back to the drawing board,” Andy muttered to Evan. 

Evan shook his head glumly. That plan was a bust, he told himself. Now 
what? 

He didn’t have time to think about it. 

He heard shrill cries and shrieks of terror. 

“Put him down! Cuddles—put him down!” Mr. Murphy was screaming. 

Evan turned and saw that the giant hamster had picked up a kid. 

Conan! 

Cuddles held Conan in both paws and was raising him toward his gaping 
mouth. 

“Drop! Drop!” Mr. Murphy was shouting. 

Conan thrashed his arms and legs. “Help me! Ohhh, hellllp me!” he 
shrieked. He started to cry. Gasping sobs. Tears rolled down his red cheeks. 

“Helllllp! Mommmmmy! Mommmmmy! Hellllp me!” 

Normally Evan would have enjoyed watching Conan cry like a baby. But 
this was too serious. Cuddles could chew Conan in half! Evan realized. 

He grabbed Andy. “Where’s the Monster Blood?” 

“Huh? In my locker. I hid it under a bunch of stuff in my locker. Why?” 

“I need it,” Evan said. “Come on. I have another idea.” 



“I hope it’s better than the last one,” Andy muttered. 

They hurried to the door, then glanced back. 

Cuddles was playing with Conan, tossing him from paw to paw, licking him 
with his huge, pink tongue. Conan was wailing his head off. 

Evan led the way to Andy’s locker. “I’m going to eat some Monster Blood,” 
he told her, thinking out loud. “I’ll eat a lot. I’ll grow bigger than Cuddles.” 

“I get it,” Andy said, running beside him. “You’ll turn yourself into a giant. 
You’ll make yourself as big as Cuddles.” 

“No,” Evan replied. “Bigger. Much bigger. I’ll make myself so big that 
Cuddles will look hamster size. Then I’ll stuff him in the supply closet and lock 
the door.” 

“It’s a stupid plan,” Andy said. 

“I know,” Evan agreed. 

“But it’s worth a try,” Andy added. 

Evan swallowed hard and didn’t reply. He was staring across the hall at 
Andy’s locker. 

“Oh, no!” Andy cried out when she saw what Evan was gaping at. 

The locker door bulged as if about to burst open. And green goo poured out 
from the sides and the bottom. 

“The Monster Blood—it outgrew my locker!” Andy cried. 

Evan ran up to it and grabbed the door handle. He started to tug. “Is it 
locked?” 

“No,” Andy replied, hanging back. 

Evan tugged. He tugged harder. With a loud groan, he tugged with both 
hands. “It won’t open!” he cried. 

“Let me try it,” Andy said. 

But before she could step forward, the locker door burst open with a loud 
whoooosh. 

Sticky, green gunk splashed over Evan. 

He didn’t have a chance to cry out. 

It poured over him like a tall, cresting ocean wave. 

An ocean wave of Monster Blood. 

It’s burying me! Evan realized. 

The huge, sticky glob splashed out of the locker, plopped over him, 
smothering him, choking him. 

It’s sucking me in! I can’t move! 



I can’t move! 



25 


Evan shut his eyes as the heavy, green gunk rolled over his head. He shot his 
arms out, trying to push it away. 

As it swept over him, he fell to his knees. Kicking and thrashing, it forced 
him down to the floor. 

I’m stuck inside, he thought. Stuck inside... 

He felt hands grab his ankles. 

The hands tugged hard. 

He began to slide. Over the floor. Over the thick layer of Monster Blood. 

“I’ve got you!” he heard Andy cry. “I’ve got you out!” 

He opened his eyes. He saw her pulling him, tugging him out of the thick 
green gunk by the ankles. 

It clung to his clothes and his skin. But he was out. 

“Thanks,” he murmured weakly. He climbed shakily to his feet. 

He could hear Conan screaming and crying back in the classroom. There 
was still time to save him, Evan realized. 

He pulled a hunk of Monster Blood off the quivering green mound—and 
jammed it into his mouth. 

“I’m going to be sick,” Andy groaned, holding her stomach. 

Evan swallowed and reached for another mouthful. “It doesn’t taste bad,” 
he told her. “A little lemony.” 

“Don’t eat too much!” she cried, half-covering her eyes as she watched him 
swallow another mouthful. 

“I have to grow big enough so that Cuddles is hamster size compared to 
me,” Evan said. He grabbed another hunk. 

He could already feel himself start to grow. His head was already over the 
tops of the lockers. 

Back in the classroom, Conan let out another terrified wail. 

“Let’s go!” Evan boomed. His voice thundered deeply in his new, larger 
body. He could feel himself growing taller. Taller. 

He had to lower his head to get through the classroom door. 

Kids and teachers moved out of his way, crying out their surprise and 



alarm. 

He crossed the room, passed Mr. Murphy, and stepped up to the giant 
hamster. “I’m as big as Cuddles!” Evan called down to Andy. 

He reached out and lifted Conan from Cuddles’ paws. Cuddles reached out 
to take Conan back. But Evan lowered him gently to the floor. 

“Hellllp me! Helllp me! ” Conan ran bawling from the room. 

Evan turned to face the hamster. They stared at each other eye to eye. 

Cuddles’ huge pink nose twitched. He sniffed Evan, inhaling so hard that 
Evan was nearly sucked forward. 

Evan took a step back. 

Keep growing! he urged himself. I’ve got to keep growing! 

Cuddles eyed him warily, still sniffing. His watery black eyes stared hard as 
if trying to figure out if Evan was friend or foe. 

“Don’t you remember me, Cuddles?” Evan said softly. “Remember, I’m the 
one who fed you after school every day?” 

Keep growing! he silently urged himself. 

Why aren’t I growing any taller? 

Down below, he could see Andy, Mr. Murphy, and the others huddled 
against the far wall, staring up at the two giants in hushed terror. 

Keep growing! Keep growing! 

There was no way he could pick Cuddles up now, Evan realized. They were 
exactly the same height. And Cuddles outweighed him by at least a ton! 

Keep growing! 

“What’s wrong, Andy?” Evan called down to her in a trembling voice. “I 
ate tons of the stuff. Why did I stop growing?” 

“I don’t know!” she called up to him. Her voice sounded as tiny as a 
mouse’s squeak. 

He saw that she had the blue can in her hand. She was turning it over, 
reading the label. “I don’t know, Evan!” she shouted. “I don’t know why you’re 
not growing!” 

Then, as Evan turned back to face Cuddles, the hamster reached out and 
grabbed his waist with both front paws. 

“Ow!” Evan cried as the hamster tried to lift him off the floor. 

Gazing up, he saw the gaping hamster mouth open, the sharp white teeth 
emerge. 

Evan squirmed desperately, pulling himself loose. Then he wrapped both 



arms around the hamster’s middle. 

They started to wrestle. Evan fought hard, but the hamster overpowered 
him. Cuddles rolled Evan onto his back on the floor. 

Evan spun quickly away, climbed to his feet, and pulled the hamster down. 

The two giants wrestled over the floor, surrounded by the shrill screams of 
teachers and kids. 

Grow bigger! Grow bigger — now! Evan pleaded. 

But it was too late, he saw. 

The hamster lowered its hot, furry body over him. Evan could feel the 
creature’s booming heartbeat as it pressed him to the floor. 

Then its teeth rose up over Evan’s head. 

The hamster’s mouth opened wide. 

The teeth swung down. 

A wave of hot, sour hamster breath blew down over Evan. 

He shut his eyes. 

“Sorry,” he murmured to Andy. 

He held his breath and waited for the teeth to clamp down. 



26 


Evan heard a pop, like the sound of a cork flying off a bottle. 

Still sprawled on his back on the floor, Evan opened his eyes. 

“Huh?” Cuddles had disappeared. Vanished. 

Evan stared up at the startled faces of kids and teachers against the wall. 
“Wh-where’s Cuddles?” he stammered. 

Andy stood frozen like a statue, her mouth open. 

Evan slowly realized that she was nearly as big as he was. In fact, everyone 
was about his size. 

He pulled himself up to a sitting position. “Hey—I’m back to my normal 
size! ” he cried. He shook his head hard as if trying to shake away his close call 
with the giant hamster. 

“There’s Cuddles!” Andy cried, pointing. 

Evan turned to see Cuddles huddled against the wall. “He’s a little hamster 
again!” Evan exclaimed happily. He took three quick steps, bent down, and 
grabbed Cuddles between his hands. “Gotcha!” 

Holding the hamster in front of him, he turned back to Andy and the others. 
“What happened? Why did we shrink back?” 

Andy was studying the blue Monster Blood can. Suddenly she tossed back 
her dark hair, her brown eyes lit up, and she started to laugh. “It’s the expiration 
date!” she cried happily. “The expiration date on the can—it’s today! The 
Monster Blood stops working today! The magic has worn out!” 

Evan let out a whoop of joy. 

Mr. Murphy, a wide grin on his round face, hurried over and put his arm 
around Evan’s shoulders. “Fine job, Evan! Fine job!” he exclaimed. “You saved 
the school. I’m proud of you!” 

“Thanks, Mr. Murphy,” Evan replied awkwardly. 

“You’ll never make a basketball player now that you’re short again,” Mr. 
Murphy said, smiling. “But that was quite a good match with Cuddles. Have you 
ever thought of trying out for the wrestling team?” 

Andy came to Evan’s house for dinner that night. He greeted her at the door, 
eager to tell her how all the kids had apologized for not believing him about the 



Monster Blood. 

But before he could say anything, she held up a large brown envelope and 
grinned at him. 

“What’s that?” he asked, following her into the living room. 

“It’s a present my parents sent me from Europe,” she replied, her grin 
growing wider. “You won’t believe what it is.” 

She started to pull open the envelope. But the front doorbell rang. 

Evan hurried to see who it was. 

“Mr. Murphy!” he cried in surprise. 

“Hi, Evan,” the teacher said, his round body nearly filling the entire front 
stoop. “Hope I’m not interrupting your dinner.” 

“No,” Evan replied. “Want to come in?” 

“No thanks,” Mr. Murphy replied. His expression turned solemn. “I came 
by because I thought you should have some sort of reward, Evan. You were a 
real hero at school today.” 

“Aw, not really,” Evan said awkwardly. He could feel his face growing hot 
and knew he was blushing. 

What kind of reward? Evan wondered, staring back at the teacher. A cash 
reward? 

Mr. Murphy raised the hamster cage into Evan’s view. “I’ve decided to 
reward you with Cuddles,” the teacher said. “I know how fond of him you are.” 

“No, please!” Evan started to plead. 

“It’s a small token,” Mr. Murphy said. “To show how grateful I am. How 
grateful we all are.” 

“Please—no—!” 

But before Evan realized it, the hamster cage was in his hand, and Mr. 
Murphy was waddling back down the driveway to his car. 

“He gave you Cuddles?” Andy asked as Evan returned to the living room 
carrying the cage. He set it down on the coffee table. 

“It’s my reward,” Evan told her, rolling his eyes. “Do you believe it?” 

“Well, you won’t believe this!” Andy declared. “Look what my parents 
found in Europe!” 

She reached into the envelope and pulled out a blue plastic can. “It’s 
Monster Blood!” 

“Oh, no!” Evan wailed. 

“They wrote that they remembered how much fun I had with the old can,” 



Andy said, holding up the blue container. “So when they saw this can in a toy 
store in Germany, they decided to send me a new one.” 

Evan’s eyes went wide with fear. “You—you’re not going to open it?” he 
demanded warily. 

“Already did,” Andy replied. “Just to take a look. But I’m not going to use 
it. Really. I promise.” 

Evan started to say something—but he was interrupted by his mother’s call 
from the kitchen. “Dinnertime, you two! Wash your hands and come to the 
table!” 

Andy set the can of Monster Blood down on the desk in the corner. They 
obediently hurried to wash their hands. 

They had a lively dinner. There was lots to talk about. They laughed and 
joked about all that had happened at school. It was easy to laugh about it now 
that it was all over. 

After dinner, Evan and Andy returned to the living room. 

Andy was the first to see that the door to the hamster cage was wide open. 
The cage was empty. 

Evan was the one who spotted Cuddles on the desk. 

“Cuddles—what are you eating?” he cried. “What are you eating?” 




DEEP TROUBLE 
Goosebumps -19 
R.L. Stine 


1 


There I was, two hundred feet under the sea. 

I was on the hunt of my life. The hunt for the Great White Stingray. 

That’s what they called him at Coast Guard Headquarters. But, me, I called 
him Joe. 

The giant stingray had already stung ten swimmers. People were afraid to 
step into the water. Panic spread all up and down the coast. 

That’s why they sent for me. 

William Deep, Jr., of Baltimore, Maryland. 

Yes, William Deep, Jr., world-famous twelve-year-old undersea explorer. 
Solver of scary ocean problems. 

I captured the Great White Shark that terrorized Myrtle Beach. I proved he 
wasn’t so great! 

I fought the giant octopus that ate the entire California Championship 
Surfing Team. 

I unplugged the electric eel that sent shock waves all over Miami. 

But now I faced the fight of my life. Joe, the Great White Stingray. 

Somewhere down deep under the sea, he lurked. 

I had everything I needed: scuba suit, flippers, mask, oxygen tank, and 
poison-dart gun. 

Wait—did something move? Just behind that giant clam? 

I raised my dart gun and waited for an attack. 

Then, suddenly, my mask clouded. I couldn’t breathe. 

I strained for breath. No air came. 

My oxygen tank! Someone must have tampered with it! 

There was no time to lose. Two hundred feet down—and no air! I had to 
surface—fast! 

I kicked my legs, desperately trying to pull myself to the surface. 

Holding my breath. My lungs about to burst. I was losing strength, getting 
dizzy. 

Would I make it? Or would I die right here, deep under the ocean, Joe the 
Stingray’s dinner? 



Panic swept over me like an ocean tide. I searched through the fogged mask 
for my diving partner. Where was she when I needed her? 

Finally, I spotted her swimming up at the surface, near the boat. 

Help me! Save me! No air! I tried to tell her, waving my arms like a 
maniac. 

Finally she noticed me. She swam toward me and dragged my dazed and 
limp body to the surface. 

I ripped off my mask and sucked in mouthfuls of air. 

“What’s your problem, Aqua Man?” she cried. “Did a jellyfish sting you?” 

My diving partner is very brave. She laughs in the face of danger. 

I struggled to catch my breath. “No air. Someone—cut off—tank—” 

Then everything went black. 



2 


My diving partner shoved my head back under the water. I opened my eyes and 
came up sputtering. 

“Get real, Billy,” she said. “Can’t you snorkel without acting like a total 
jerk?” 

I sighed. She was no fun. 

My “diving partner” was really just my bratty sister, Sheena. I was only 
pretending to be William Deep, Jr., undersea explorer. 

But would it kill Sheena to go along with it just once? 

My name actually is William Deep, Jr., but everybody calls me Billy. I’m 
twelve—I think I mentioned that already. 

Sheena is ten. She looks like me. We both have straight black hair, but mine 
is short and hers goes down to her shoulders. We’re both skinny, with knobby 
knees and elbows, and long, narrow feet. We both have dark blue eyes and thick, 
dark eyebrows. 

Other than that, we’re not alike at all. 

Sheena has no imagination. She was never afraid of monsters in her closet 
when she was little. She didn’t believe in Santa Claus or the tooth fairy, either. 
She loves to say, “There’s no such thing.” 

I dove underwater and pinched Sheena’s leg. Attack of the Giant Lobster 
Man! 

“Stop it!” she screamed. She kicked me in the shoulder. I came up for air. 

“Hey, you two,” my uncle said. “Be careful down there.” 

My uncle stood on the deck of his sea lab boat, the Cassandra. He peered 
down at Sheena and me snorkeling nearby. 

My uncle’s name is George Deep, but everybody calls him Dr. D. Even my 
dad, who is his brother, calls him Dr. D. Maybe that’s because he looks just the 
way a scientist should. 

Dr. D. is short, thin, wears glasses and a very serious, thoughtful 
expression. He has curly brown hair and a bald spot at the back of his head. 
Anyone who saw him would say, “I bet you’re a scientist.” 

Sheena and I were visiting Dr. D. on the Cassandra. Every year our parents 
let us spend our summer vacation with Dr. D. It sure beats hanging out at home. 



This summer, we were anchored just off a tiny island called Ilandra, in the 
Caribbean Sea. 

Dr. D. is a marine biologist. He specializes in tropical marine life. He 
studies the habits of tropical fish and looks for new kinds of ocean plants and 
fish that haven’t been discovered yet. 

The Cassandra is a big and sturdy boat. It is about fifty feet long. Dr. D. 
uses most of the space for labs and research rooms. Up on deck is a cockpit, 
where he steers the boat. He keeps a dinghy tied to the starboard, or right side of 
the deck, and a huge glass tank on the port, or left side. 

Sometimes Dr. D. catches very big fish and keeps them temporarily in the 
glass tank—usually just long enough to tag the fish for research, or care for them 
if they are sick or injured. 

The rest of the deck is open space, good for playing catch or sunbathing. 

Dr. D.’s research takes him all over the world. He isn’t married and doesn’t 
have any kids. He says he’s too busy staring at fish. 

But he likes kids. That’s why he invites me and Sheena to visit him every 
summer. 

“Stick close together, kids,” Dr. D. said. “And don’t swim off too far. 
Especially you, Billy.” 

He narrowed his eyes at me. That’s his “I mean it” look. He never narrows 
his eyes at Sheena. 

“There’ve been reports of some shark sightings in the area,” he said. 

“Sharks! Wow!” I cried. 

Dr. D. frowned at me. “Billy,” he said. “This is serious. Don’t leave the 
boat. And don’t go near the reef.” 

I knew he was going to say that. 

Clamshell Reef is a long, red coral reef just a few hundred yards away from 
where we were anchored. I’d been dying to explore it ever since we got there. 

“Don’t worry about me, Dr. D.,” I called up to him. “I won’t get into 
trouble.” 

Sheena muttered under her breath, “Yeah, right.” 

I reached out to give her another lobster pinch, but she dove under water. 

“Good,” said Dr. D. “Now don’t forget—if you see a shark fin, try not to 
splash around a lot. Movement will attract it. Just slowly, steadily return to the 
boat.” 

“We won’t forget,” said Sheena, who had come up behind me, splashing 



like crazy. 

I couldn’t help feeling just a little bit excited. I’d always wanted to see a 
real, live shark. 

I’d seen sharks at the aquarium, of course. But they were trapped in a glass 
tank, where they just swam around restlessly, perfectly harmless. 

Not very exciting. 

I wanted to spot a shark’s fin on the horizon, floating over the water, closer, 
closer, heading right for us.... 

In other words, I wanted adventure. 

The Cassandra was anchored out in the ocean, a few hundred yards away 
from Clamshell Reef. The reef surrounded the island. Between the reef and the 
island stretched a beautiful lagoon. 

Nothing was going to stop me from exploring that lagoon—no matter what 
Dr. D. said. 

“Come on, Billy,” Sheena called, adjusting her mask. “Let’s check out that 
school of fish.” 

She pointed to a patch of tiny ripples in the water near the bow of the boat. 
She slid the mouthpiece into her mouth and lowered her head into the water. I 
followed her to the ripples. 

Soon Sheena and I were surrounded by hundreds of tiny, neon-blue fish. 

Underwater, I always felt as if I were in a faraway world. Breathing through 
the snorkel, I could live down here with the fish and the dolphins, I thought. 
After a while, maybe I would grow flippers and a fin. 

The tiny blue fish began to swim away, and I swam with them. They were 
so great-looking! I didn’t want them to leave me behind. 

Suddenly, the fish all darted from view. I tried to follow, but they were too 

fast. 

They had vanished! 

Had something scared them away? 

I glanced around. Clumps of seaweed floated near the surface. Then I saw a 
flash of red. 

I floated closer, peering through the mask. A few yards ahead of me I saw 
bumpy red formations. Red coral. 

Oh, no, I thought. Clamshell Reef. Dr. D. told me not to swim this far. 

I began to turn around. I knew I should swim back to the boat. 

But I was tempted to stay and explore a little. After all, I was already there. 



The reef looked like a red sand castle, filled with underwater caves and 
tunnels. Small fish darted in and out of them. The fish were bright yellow and 
blue. 

Maybe I could swim over and explore one of those tunnels, I thought. How 
dangerous could it be? 

Suddenly, I felt something brush against my leg. It tickled and sent a tingle 
up my leg. 

A fish? 

I glanced around, but I didn’t see anything. 

Then I felt it again. 

A tingling against my leg. 

And then it clutched me. 

Again I turned to see what it was. Again I saw nothing. 

My heart began to race. I knew it was probably nothing dangerous. But I 
wished I could see it. 

I turned and started back for the boat, kicking hard. 

But something grabbed my right leg—and held on! 

I froze in fear. Then I frantically kicked my leg as hard as I could. 

Let go! Let go of me! 

I couldn’t see it—and I couldn’t pull free! 

The water churned and tossed as I kicked with all my strength. 

Overcome with terror, I lifted my head out of the water and choked out a 
weak cry: “Help!” 

But it was no use. 

Whatever it was, it kept pulling me down. Down. 

Down to the bottom of the sea. 



3 


“Help!” I cried out again. “Sheena! Dr. D.!” 

I was dragged below the surface again. I felt the slimy tentacle tighten 
around my ankle. 

As I sank underwater, I turned—and saw it. 

It loomed huge and dark. 

A sea monster! 

Through the churning waters, it glared at me with one giant brown eye. The 
terrifying creature floated underwater like an enormous, dark green balloon. Its 
mouth opened in a silent cry, revealing two rows of jagged, sharp teeth. 

An enormous octopus! But it had at least twelve tentacles! 

Twelve long, slimy tentacles. One was wrapped around my ankle. Another 
one slid toward me. 

NO! 

My arms thrashed the water. 

I gulped in mouthfuls of air. 

I struggled to the surface—but the huge creature dragged me down again. 

I couldn’t believe it. As I sank, scenes from my life actually flashed before 
my eyes. 

I saw my parents, waving to me as I boarded the yellow school bus for my 
first day of school. 

Mom and Dad! I’ll never see them again! 

What a way to go, I thought. Killed by a sea monster! 

No one will believe it. 

Everything started to turn red. I felt dizzy, weak. 

But something was pulling me, pulling me up. 

Up to the surface. Away from the tentacled monster. 

I opened my eyes, choking and sputtering. 

I stared up at Dr. D! 

“Billy! Are you all right?” Dr. D. studied me with concern. 

I coughed and nodded. I kicked my right leg. The slimy tentacle was gone. 

The dark creature had vanished. 



“I heard you screaming and saw you thrashing about,” said Dr. D. “I swam 
over from the boat as fast as I could. What happened?” 

Dr. D. had a yellow life jacket over his shoulders. He slipped a rubber 
lifesaver ring over my head. I floated easily now, the life ring under my arms. 

I had lost my flippers in the struggle. My mask and snorkel dangled around 
my neck. 

Sheena swam over and floated beside me, treading water. 

“It grabbed my leg!” I cried breathlessly. “It tried to pull me under!” 

“What grabbed your leg, Billy?” asked Dr. D. “I don’t see anything around 
here—” 

“It was a sea monster,” I told him. “A huge one! I felt its slimy tentacle 
grabbing my leg.... Ouch!” 

Something pinched my toe. 

“It’s back!” I shrieked in horror. 

Sheena popped out of the water and shook her wet hair, laughing. 

“That was me, you dork!” she cried. 

“Billy, Billy,” Dr. D. murmured. “You and your wild imagination.” He 
shook his head. “You nearly scared me to death. Please—don’t ever do that 
again. Your leg probably got tangled in a piece of seaweed, that’s all.” 

“But—but—!” I sputtered. 

He dipped his hand in the water and pulled up a handful of slimy green 
strings. “There’s seaweed everywhere.” 

“But I saw it!” I shouted. “I saw its tentacles, its big, pointy teeth!” 

“There’s no such thing as sea monsters,” said Sheena. Miss Know-It-All. 

“Let’s discuss it on the boat,” my uncle said, dropping the clump of 
seaweed back in the water. 

“Come on. Swim back with me. And stay away from the reef. Swim around 
it.” 

He turned around and started swimming toward the Cassandra. I saw that 
the sea monster had pulled me into the lagoon. The reef lay between us and the 
boat. But there was a break in the reef we could swim through. 

I followed them, thinking angry thoughts. 

Why didn’t they believe me? 

I had seen the creature grab my leg. It wasn’t a stupid clump of seaweed. It 
wasn’t my imagination. 

I was determined to prove them wrong. I’d find that creature and show it to 



them myself—someday. But not today. 

Now I was ready to get back to the safety of the boat. 

I swam up to Sheena and called, “Race you to the boat.” 

“Last one there is a chocolate-covered jellyfish!” she cried. 

Sheena can’t refuse a race. She started speeding toward the boat, but I 
caught her by the arm. 

“Wait,” I said. “No fair. You’re wearing flippers. Take them off.” 

“Too bad!” she cried, and pulled away. “See you at the boat!” I watched her 
splash away, building a good lead. 

She’s not going to win, I decided. 

I stared at the reef up ahead. 

It would be faster just to swim over the reef. A shortcut. 

I turned and started to swim straight toward the red coral. 

“Billy! Get back here!” Dr. D. shouted. 

I pretended I didn’t hear him. 

The reef loomed ahead. I was almost there. 

I saw Sheena splashing ahead of me. I kicked extra-hard. I knew she’d 
never have the guts to swim over the reef. She’d swim around the end of it. I 
would cut through and beat her. 

But my arms suddenly began to ache. I wasn’t used to swimming so far. 

Maybe I can stop at the reef and rest my arms for a second, I thought. 

I reached the reef. I turned around. Sheena was swimming to the left, 
around the reef. I figured I had a few seconds to rest. 

I stepped onto the red coral reef— 

—and screamed in horror! 



4 


My foot burned as if it were on fire. The throbbing pain shot up my leg. 

I screamed and dove into the water. 

When I surfaced, I heard Sheena yelling, “Dr. D.! Come quick!” 

My foot burned, even in the cold ocean water. 

Dr. D. came up beside me. “Billy, what’s the problem now?” he demanded. 
“I saw him do something really stupid,” Sheena said, smirking. 

If my foot hadn’t been burning up, I definitely would have punched out her 
lights. 

“My foot!” I moaned. “I stepped on the reef—and—and—” 

Dr. D. held on to the lifesaver ring around my waist. “Ow. That’s painful,” 
he said, reaching up to pat my shoulder. “But you’ll be all right. The burning will 
stop in a little while.” 

He pointed to the reef. “All that bright red coral is fire coral.” 

“Huh? Fire coral?” I stared back at it. 

“Even I knew that!” Sheena said. 

“It’s covered with a mild poison,” my uncle continued. “When it touches 
your skin, it burns like fire.” 

Now he tells me, I thought. 

“Don’t you know anything ?” Sheena asked sarcastically. 

She was asking for it. She really was. 

“You’re lucky you only burned your foot,” Dr. D. said. “Coral can be very 
sharp. You could have cut your foot and gotten poison into your bloodstream. 
Then you’d really be in trouble.” 

“Wow! What kind of trouble?” Sheena asked. She seemed awfully eager to 
hear about all the terrible things that could have happened to me. 

Dr. D.’s expression turned serious. “The poison could paralyze you,” he 

said. 

“Oh great,” I said. 

“So keep away from the red coral from now on,” Dr. D. warned. “And stay 
away from the lagoon, too.” 

“But that’s where the sea monster lives!” I protested. “We have to go back 



there. I have to show it to you!” 

Sheena bobbed in the blue-green water. “No such thing, no such thing,” she 
chanted. Her favorite phrase. “No such thing—right, Dr. D.?” 

“Well, you never know,” Dr. D. replied thoughtfully. “We don’t know all of 
the creatures that live in the oceans, Sheena. It’s better to say that scientists have 
never seen one.” 

“So there, She-Ra,” I said. 

Sheena spit a stream of water at me. She hates it when I call her She-Ra. 
“Listen, kids—I’m serious about staying away from this area,” said Dr. D. 
“There may not be a sea monster in that lagoon, but there could be sharks, 
poisonous fish, electric eels. Any number of dangerous creatures. Don’t swim 
over there.” 

He paused and frowned at me, as if to make sure I’d been paying attention. 
“How’s your foot feeling, Billy?” he asked. 

“It’s a little better now,” I told him. 

“Good. Enough adventure for one morning. Let’s get back to the boat. It’s 
almost lunchtime.” 

We all started swimming back to the Cassandra. 

As I kicked, I felt something tickle my leg again. 

Seaweed? 

No. 

It brushed against my thigh like— fingers. 

“Cut it out, Sheena,” I shouted angrily. I spun around to splash water in her 

face. 

But she wasn’t there. She wasn’t anywhere near me. 

She was up ahead, swimming beside Dr. D. 

Sheena couldn’t possibly have tickled me. 

But something definitely did. 

I stared down at the water, suddenly gripped with terror. 

What was down there? 

Why was it teasing me like that? 

Was it preparing to grab me again and pull me down forever?

Alexander DuBrow, Dr. D.’s assistant, helped us aboard the boat. 

“Hey, I heard shouting,” Alexander said. “Is everything okay?” 

“Everything is fine, Alexander,” said Dr. D. “Billy stepped on some fire 
coral, but he’s all right.” 

As I climbed up the ladder, Alexander grabbed my hands and pulled me 
aboard. 

“Wow, Billy,” he said. “Fire coral. I accidentally bumped into the fire coral 
my first day here. I saw stars. I really did, man. You sure you’re okay?” 

I nodded and showed him my foot. “It feels better now. But that wasn’t the 
worst thing that happened. I was almost eaten by a sea monster!” 

“No such thing, no such thing,” Sheena chanted. 

“I really saw it,” I insisted. “They don’t believe me. But it was there. In the 
lagoon. It was big and green and—” 

Alexander smiled. “If you say so, Billy,” he said. He winked at Sheena. 

I wanted to punch out his lights, too. 

Big deal science student. What did he know? 

Alexander was in his early twenties. But, unlike Dr. D., he didn’t look like a 
scientist. 

He looked more like a football player. He was very tall, about six feet four 
inches, and muscular. He had thick, wavy blond hair and blue eyes that crinkled 
in the corners. He had broad shoulders, and big, powerful-looking hands. He 
spent a lot of time in the sun and had a smooth, dark tan. 

“I hope you’re all hungry,” Alexander said. “I made chicken salad 
sandwiches for lunch.” 

“Oh. Great,” Sheena said, rolling her eyes. 

Alexander did most of the cooking. He thought he was good at it. But he 
wasn’t. 

I went below deck to my cabin to change out of my wet bathing suit. My 
cabin was really just a tiny sleeping cubby with a cupboard for my things. 
Sheena had one just like it. Dr. D. and Alexander had bigger cabins that they 
could actually walk around in. 

We ate in the galley, which was what Dr. D. called the boat’s kitchen. It had 



a built-in table and built-in seats, and a small area for cooking. 

When I entered the galley, Sheena was already sitting at the table. There 
was a big sandwich on a plate in front of her, and one waiting for me. 

Neither of us was too eager to try Alexander’s chicken salad. The night 
before, we had had Brussels sprouts casserole. For breakfast this morning, he 
served us whole wheat pancakes that sank to the bottom of my stomach like the 
Titanic going down! 

“You first,” I whispered to my sister. 

“Uh-uh,” Sheena said, shaking her head. “You try it. You’re older.” 

My stomach growled. I sighed. There was nothing to do but taste it. 

I sank my teeth into the sandwich and started chewing. 

Not bad, I thought at first. A little chicken, a little mayonnaise. It actually 
tasted like a regular chicken salad sandwich. 

Then, suddenly, my tongue started to burn. My whole mouth was on fire! 

I let out a cry and grabbed for the glass of iced tea in front of me. I downed 
the entire glass. 

“Fire coral!” I screamed. “You put fire coral in the chicken salad!” 

Alexander laughed. “Just a little chili pepper. For taste. You like it?” 

“I think I’d rather have cereal for lunch,” Sheena said, setting down her 
sandwich. “If you don’t mind.” 

“You can’t have cereal for every meal,” Alexander replied, frowning. “No 
wonder you’re so skinny, Sheena. You never eat anything but cereal. Where’s 
your spirit of adventure?” 

“I think I’ll have cereal, too,” I said sheepishly. “Just for a change of pace.” 

Dr. D. came into the galley. “What’s for lunch?” he asked. 

“Chicken salad sandwiches,” said Alexander. “I made them spicy.” 

“Very spicy,” I warned him. 

Dr. D. glanced at me and raised an eyebrow. “Oh, really?” he said. “You 
know, I’m not very hungry. I think I’ll just have cereal for lunch.” 

“Maybe Billy and I could make dinner tonight,” Sheena offered. She poured 
cereal into a bowl and added milk. “It’s not fair for Alexander to cook all the 
time.” 

“That’s a nice idea, Sheena,” said Dr. D. “What do you two know how to 
make?” 

“I know how to make brownies from a mix,” I offered. 

“And I know how to make fudge,” said Sheena. 



“Hmm,” said Dr. D. “Maybe I’ll cook tonight. How does grilled fish 
sound?” 

“Great!” I said. 

After lunch, Dr. D. went into his office to go over some notes. Alexander led 
Sheena and me into the main lab to show us around. 

The work lab was really cool. It had three big glass tanks along the wall 
filled with weird, amazing fish. 

The smallest tank held two bright yellow sea horses and an underwater 
trumpet. The underwater trumpet was a long, red-and-white fish shaped like a 
tube. There were also a lot of guppies swimming around in this tank. 

Another tank held some flame angelfish, which were orange-red like fire, 
and a harlequin tusk-fish, with orange-and-aqua tiger stripes for camouflage. 

The biggest tank held a long, black-and-yellow snakelike thing with a 
mouth full of teeth. 

“Ugh!” Sheena made a disgusted face as she stared at the long fish. “That 
one is really gross!” 

“That’s a black ribbon eel,” said Alexander. “He bites, but he’s not deadly. 
We call him Biff.” 

I snarled through the glass at Biff, but he ignored me. 

I wondered what it would be like to come face to face with Biff in the 
ocean. His teeth looked nasty, but he wasn’t nearly as big as the sea monster. I 
figured William Deep, Jr., world-famous undersea explorer, could handle it. 

I turned away from the fish tanks and stood by the control panel, staring at 
all the knobs and dials. 

“What does this do?” I asked. I pushed a button. A loud horn blared. We all 
jumped, startled. 

“It honks the horn,” Alexander said, laughing. 

“Dr. D. told Billy not to touch things without asking first,” said Sheena. 
“He’s told him a million times. He never listens.” 

“Shut up, She-Ra!” I said sharply. 

“You shut up.” 

“Hey—no problem,” said Alexander, raising both hands, motioning for us 
to chill out. “No harm done.” 

I turned back to the panel. Most of the dials were lit up, with little red 
indicators moving across their faces. I noticed one dial that was dark, its red 



indicator still. 

“What’s this for?” I asked, pointing to the dark dial. “It looks like you 
forgot to turn it on.” 

“Oh, that controls the Nansen bottle,” Alexander said. “It’s broken.” 

“What’s a Nansen bottle?” asked Sheena. 

“It collects samples of seawater from way down deep,” said Alexander. 

“Why don’t you fix it?” I asked. 

“We can’t afford to,” said Alexander. 

“Why not?” asked Sheena. “Doesn’t the university give you money?” 

We both knew that Dr. D.’s research was paid for by a university in Ohio. 

“They gave us money for our research,” Alexander explained. “But it’s 
almost gone. We’re waiting to see if they’ll give us more. In the meantime, we 
don’t have the money to fix things.” 

“What if the Cassandra breaks down or something?” I asked. 

“Then I guess we’ll have to put her in dry dock for a while,” said 
Alexander. “Or else find a new way to get more money.” 

“Wow,” said Sheena. “That would mean no more summer visits.” 

I hated to think of the Cassandra just sitting on a dock. Even worse was the 
thought of Dr. D. being stuck on land with no fish to study. 

Our uncle was miserable whenever he had to go ashore. He didn’t feel 
comfortable unless he was on a boat. I know, because one Christmas he came to 
our house to visit. 

Usually Dr. D. is fun to be with. But that Christmas visit was a nightmare. 

Dr. D. spent the whole time pacing through the house. He barked orders at 
us like a sea captain. 

“Billy, sit up straight!” he yelled at me. “Sheena, swab the decks!” 

He just wasn’t himself. 

Finally, on Christmas Eve, my dad couldn’t take it anymore. He told Dr. D. 
to shape up or ship out. 

Dr. D. ended up spending a good part of Christmas Day in the bathtub 
playing with my old toy boats. As long as he stayed in the water, he was back to 
normal. 

I never wanted to see Dr. D. stranded on land again. 

“Don’t worry, kids,” Alexander said. “Dr. D. has always found a way to get 
by.” 


I hoped Alexander was right. 



I studied another strange dial, marked Sonar Probes. 

“Hey, Alexander,” I said. “Will you show me how the sonar probes work?” 

“Sure,” said Alexander. “Just let me finish a few chores.” 

He walked over to the first fish tank. He scooped out a few guppies with a 
small net. 

“Who wants to feed Biff today?” 

“Not me,” said Sheena. “Yuck!” 

“No way!” I said as I stepped to a porthole and peered out. 

I thought I heard a motor outside. So far we had seen very few other boats. 
Not many people passed by Ilandra. 

A white boat chugged up to the side of the Cassandra. It was smaller but 
newer than our boat. A logo on the side said Marina Zoo. 

A man and a woman stood on the deck of the zoo boat. They were both 
neatly dressed in khaki pants and button-down shirts. The man had a short, neat 
haircut, and the woman’s brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail. She carried a 
black briefcase. 

The man waved to someone on the deck of the Cassandra. I figured he had 
to be waving at Dr. D. 

Now Sheena and Alexander stood beside me at the porthole, watching. 

“Who’s that?” Sheena asked. 

Alexander cleared his throat. “I’d better go see what this is about,” he said. 

He handed Sheena the net with the guppies in it. “Here,” he said. “Feed 
Biff. I’ll be back later.” 

He left the lab in a hurry. 

Sheena looked at the squirming guppies in the net and made a face. 

“I’m not going to stay here and watch Biff eat these poor guppies.” She 
stuck the net in my hand and ran out of the cabin. 

I didn’t want to watch Biff eat the poor fish, either. But I didn’t know what 
else to do with them. 

I quickly dumped the guppies into Biff’s tank. The eel’s head shot forward. 
His teeth clamped down on a fish. The guppy disappeared. Biff grabbed for 
another one. 

He was a fast eater. 

I dropped the net on a table and walked out of the lab. 

I made my way down the narrow passageway, planning to go up on deck 
for some air. 



I wondered if Dr. D. would let me do some more snorkeling this afternoon. 

If he said yes, maybe I would swim toward the lagoon, see if I could find 
any sign of the sea monster. 

Was I scared? 

Yes. 

But I was also determined to prove to my sister and uncle that I wasn’t 
crazy. That I wasn’t making it up. 

I was passing Dr. D.’s office when I heard voices. I figured Dr. D. and 
Alexander must be in there with the two people from the zoo. 

I paused for just a second. I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, I swear. But the man 
from the zoo had a loud voice, and I couldn’t help but hear him. 

And what he said was the most amazing thing I had ever heard in my 
whole, entire life. 

“I don’t care how you do it, Dr. Deep,” the man bellowed. “But I want you 
to find that mermaid!” 



6 


A mermaid! 

Was he serious? 

I couldn’t believe it. Did he really want my uncle to find a real, live 
mermaid? 

I knew Sheena would start chanting, “No such thing, no such thing.” But 
here was a grown man, a man who worked for a zoo, talking about a mermaid. It 
had to be real! 

My heart started to pound with excitement. I might be one of the first 
people on Earth ever to see a mermaid! I thought. 

And then I had an even better thought: What if I was the one to find her? 

I’d be famous! I’d be on TV and everything! 

William Deep, Jr., the famous sea explorer! 

Well, after I heard that, I couldn’t just walk away. I had to hear more. 

Holding my breath, I pressed my ear to the door and listened. 

“Mr. Showalter, Ms. Wickman, please understand,” I heard Dr. D. saying. 
“I’m a scientist, not a circus trainer. My work is serious. I can’t waste my time 
looking for fairy tale creatures.” 

“We’re quite serious, Dr. Deep,” said Ms. Wickman. “There is a mermaid in 
these waters. And if anyone can find her, you can.” 

I heard Alexander ask, “What makes you think there’s really a mermaid out 
there?” 

“A fisherman from a nearby island spotted her,” replied the man from the 
zoo. “He said he got pretty close to her—and he’s sure she’s real. He saw her 
near the reef —this reef, just off Ilandra.” 

The reef! Maybe she lives in the lagoon! 

I leaned closer to the door. I didn’t want to miss a word of this. 

“Some of these fishermen are very superstitious, Mr. Showalter,” my uncle 
scoffed. “For years there have been stories... but no real reason to believe them.” 

“We didn’t believe the man ourselves,” said the woman. “Not at first. But 
we asked some other fishermen in the area, and they claim to have seen the 
mermaid, too. And I think they’re telling the truth. Their descriptions of her 
match, down to the smallest detail.” 



I could hear my uncle’s desk chair creak. I imagined him leaning forward as 
he asked, “And, how, exactly, did they describe her?” 

“They said she looked like a young girl,” Mr. Showalter told him. “Except 
for the”—he cleared his throat—“the fish tail. She’s small, delicate, with long, 
blond hair.” 

“They described her tail as shiny and bright green,” said the woman. “I 
know it sounds incredible, Dr. Deep. But when we spoke to the fishermen, we 
were convinced that they really saw a mermaid!” 

There was a pause. 

Was I missing something? I pressed my ear to the door. I heard my uncle 
ask, “And, why, exactly, do you want to capture this mermaid?” 

“Obviously, a real, live mermaid would be a spectacular attraction at a zoo 
like ours,” said the woman. “People from all over the world would flock to see 
her. The Marina Zoo would make millions of dollars.” 

“We are prepared to pay you very well for your trouble, Dr. Deep,” said Mr. 
Showalter. “I understand you are running out of money. What if the university 
refuses to give you more? It would be terrible if you had to stop your important 
work just because of that.” 

“The Marina Zoo can promise you one million dollars,” said the woman. “If 
you find the mermaid. I’m sure your lab could run for a long time on that much 
money.” 

A million dollars! I thought. How could Dr. D. turn down that kind of 
money? 

My heart pounded with excitement. I pushed against the door, straining to 

hear. 


What would my uncle’s answer be? 



7 


Leaning hard against the door, I heard Dr. D. let out a long, low whistle. “That’s 
quite a lot of money, Ms. Wickman,” I heard him say. 

There was a long pause. Then he continued. “But even if mermaids existed, 
I wouldn’t feel right about capturing one for a zoo to put on display.” 

“I promise you we would take excellent care of her,” replied Mr. Showalter. 
“Our dolphins and whales are very well cared for. The mermaid, of course, 
would get extra-special treatment.” 

“And, remember, Dr. Deep,” said Ms. Wickman. “If you don’t find her, 
someone else will. And there’s no guarantee that they will treat the mermaid as 
well as we will.” 

“I suppose you’re right,” I heard my uncle reply. “It would certainly be a 
big boost to my research if I found her.” 

“Then you’ll do it?” asked Mr. Showalter eagerly. 

Say yes, Dr. D.! I thought. Say yes! 

I pressed my whole body against the door. “Yes,” my uncle answered. “If 
there really is a mermaid, I’ll find her.” 

Excellent! I thought. 

“Very good,” said Ms. Wickman. 

“Excellent decision,” Mr. Showalter added enthusiastically. “I knew we had 
come to the right man for the job.” 

“We’ll be back in a couple of days to see how the search is going. I hope 
you’ll have some good news by then,” Ms. Wickman said. 

“That’s not much time,” I heard Alexander remark. 

“We know,” Ms. Wickman replied. “But, obviously, the sooner you find 
her, the better.” 

“And, please,” Mr. Showalter said, “please keep this a secret. No one must 
know about the mermaid. I’m sure you can imagine what would happen if—” 

CRASSSSSSSH! 

I lost my balance. I fell against the door. 

To my shock, it swung open—and I tumbled into the room. 



8 


I landed in a heap in the center of the cabin floor. 

Dr. D., Mr. Showalter, Ms. Wickman, and Alexander all gaped at me with 
their mouths open. I guess they hadn’t expected me to drop in. 

“Uh... hi, everyone,” I murmured. I felt my face burning, and knew that I 
was blushing. “Nice day for a mermaid hunt.” 

Mr. Showalter jumped to his feet angrily. He glared at my uncle. “This was 
supposed to be a secret!” 

Alexander strode across the room and helped me to my feet. “Don’t worry 
about Billy,” he said. He put a protective arm around me. “You can trust him.” 

“I’m very embarrassed,” Dr. D. told his visitors. “This is my nephew, Billy 
Deep. He and his sister are visiting me for a few weeks.” 

“Can they keep our secret?” asked Ms. Wickman. 

Dr. D. turned his gaze on Alexander. Alexander nodded. 

“Yes, I’m sure they can,” said Dr. D. “Billy won’t say anything to anyone. 
Right, Billy?” 

He narrowed his eyes at me. I really do hate it when he does that. But this 
time I couldn’t blame him. 

I shook my head. “No. I won’t tell anyone. I swear.” 

“Just to be on the safe side, Billy,” said Dr. D., “don’t mention the mermaid 
to Sheena. She’s too young to have to keep a big secret like this.” 

“I promise,” I replied solemnly. I raised my right hand as if swearing an 
oath. “I won’t breathe a word to Sheena.” 

This was so cool! 

I knew the biggest secret in the world—and Sheena wouldn’t have a clue! 

The man and woman from the zoo exchanged glances. I could see they 
were still worried. 

Alexander said, “You really can trust Billy. He’s very serious for someone 
his age.” 

You bet I’m serious, I thought. 

I’m William Deep, Jr., world-famous mermaid catcher. 

Mr. Showalter and Ms. Wickman seemed to relax a little. 



“Good,” said Ms. Wickman. She shook hands with Dr. D., Alexander, and 
me. 

Mr. Showalter gathered up some papers and put them into the briefcase. 
“We’ll see you in a few days, then,” said Ms. Wickman. “Good luck.” 

I won’t need luck, I thought, watching them roar away on their boat a few 
minutes later. 

I won’t need luck because I have skill. And daring. 

My head spun with all kinds of exciting thoughts. 

Would I let Sheena be on TV with me after I single-handedly captured the 
mermaid? 

Probably not. 

That night I sneaked off the boat and slipped into the dark water. I swam 
noiselessly toward the lagoon. 

I glanced back at the Cassandra. It floated quietly. All the portholes were 

dark. 

Good, I thought. No one is awake to notice that I’m gone. No one knows 
I’m out here. No one knows I’m swimming in the sea at night, all alone. 

Swimming steadily, easily, under the silvery moonlight, I made my way 
around the reef and into the dark lagoon. 

I slowed my stroke just past the reef. 

My eyes darted eagerly around the lagoon. The waves lapped gently under 
me. The water sparkled as if a million tiny diamonds floated on the surface. 
Where was the mermaid? 

I knew she was there. I knew I would find her here. 

From deep below me, I heard a low rumble. 

I listened hard. The sound, faint at first, grew louder. 

The waves tossed as the sound became a steady roar. 

It rumbled like an earthquake. An earthquake on the ocean floor. 

The waves tumbled and tossed. I struggled to stay on top of them. 

What was happening? 

Suddenly, from the middle of the lagoon, a huge wave swelled. It rose 
higher, like a gigantic geyser. 

Higher. Over my head. As tall as a building! 

A tidal wave? 

No. 



The wave broke. 

The dark creature pushed up underneath it. 

Water slid off its grotesque body. Its single eye stared out darkly at me. Its 
tentacles writhed and stretched. 

I screamed. 

The monster blinked its muddy brown eye at me. 

I tried to turn and swim away. 

But it was too fast. 

The tentacles whipped out—and grabbed me, tightening, tightening around 
my waist. 

Then a slimy, cold tentacle wrapped around my neck and started to squeeze. 



9 


“I—I can’t breathe!” I managed to choke out. 

I tugged at the tentacle twining around my throat. 

“Help me—somebody!” 

I opened my eyes—and stared up at the ceiling. 

I was lying in bed. 

In my cabin. 

The sheet was wrapped tightly around me. 

I took a deep breath and waited for my heart to stop thudding. A dream. 

Only a dream. 

I rubbed my eyes, lifted myself, and peered out the porthole. The sun was 
just rising over the horizon. The sky was morning red. The water a hazy purple. 

Squinting past the reef, I saw the lagoon. Perfectly still. Not a sea monster 
in sight. 

I wiped the sweat from my forehead with my pajama sleeve. 

No need to be afraid, I told myself. It was just a dream. A bad dream. 

I shook my head, trying to forget about the sea monster. 

I couldn’t let it scare me. I couldn’t let it stop me from finding that 
mermaid. 

Was anyone up? Had I yelled out loud in my sleep? 

I listened carefully. I could hear only the creaking of the boat, the splash of 
waves against its side. 

The pink morning sunlight cheered me. The dark water looked inviting. 

I slipped into my bathing suit and crept out of my cabin as quietly as I 
could. I didn’t want anyone to hear me. 

In the galley I saw a half-empty pot of coffee sitting on the warmer. That 
meant Dr. D. was already up. 

I tiptoed down the passageway and listened. I could hear him puttering 
around in the main lab. 

I grabbed my snorkel, flippers, and mask and went up on deck. Nobody up 
there. 

The coast was clear. 



Silently, I climbed down the ladder, slipped into the water, and snorkeled 
toward the lagoon. 

I know it was crazy to sneak away like that. But you can’t imagine how 
excited I was. Even in my wildest daydreams as William Deep, Jr., undersea 
explorer, I never thought I would see a real, live mermaid! 

As I snorkeled toward the lagoon, I tried to imagine what she would look 

like. 

Mr. Showalter had said she looked like a young girl with long, blond hair 
and a green fish tail. 

Weird, I thought. 

Half-human, half-fish. 

I tried to imagine my own legs replaced by a fish tail. 

I’d be the greatest swimmer on Earth if I had a fish tail, I thought. I could 
win the Olympics without even practicing. 

I wonder if she’s pretty? I thought. And I wonder if she can talk! I hope she 
can. She can tell me all kinds of secrets of the oceans. 

I wonder how she breathes underwater? 

I wonder if she thinks like a human or like a fish? 

So many questions. 

This is going to be the greatest adventure of my life, I thought. After I’m 
famous, I’ll write a book about my undersea adventures. I’ll call it Courage of 
the Deep, by William Deep, Jr. Maybe someone will even turn it into a movie. 

I raised my head and saw that I was nearing the reef. I concentrated on 
keeping away from it. I didn’t want to touch that fire coral again. 

I couldn’t wait to explore the lagoon. I was so excited, I forgot all about the 
terrifying dream I had had the night before. 

I kicked my legs carefully, watching out for red coral. 

I was nearly past the reef when I felt something brush my leg. 

“Oh!” I cried out and swallowed a mouthful of salty water. 

Sputtering and choking, I felt something wrap around my ankle. 

As it grabbed at me, it scratched my ankle. 

This time I knew for sure it wasn’t seaweed. 

Seaweed doesn’t have claws! 



10 


Ignoring the panic that nearly froze me, I kicked and thrashed with all my 
strength. 

“Stop it! Stop kicking me!” a voice screamed. 

The mermaid? 

“Hey—!” I cried out angrily as Sheena’s head appeared beside me. 

She pulled up her snorkeling mask. “I didn’t scratch you that hard!” she 
snapped. “You don’t have to go crazy!” 

“What are you doing here?” I cried. 

“What are you doing here?” she demanded nastily. “You know Dr. D. told 
us not to swim here.” 

“Then you shouldn’t be here —should you?” I shouted. 

“I knew you were up to something, so I followed you,” Sheena replied, 
adjusting her mask. 

“I’m not up to anything,” I lied. “I’m just snorkeling.” 

“Sure, Billy. You’re just snorkeling at six-thirty in the morning exactly 
where you’re not supposed to —and where you burned your foot on that fire 
coral yesterday. You’re either up to something, or you’re totally crazy!” She 
squinted at me, waiting for a response. 

What a choice! I was either up to something, or crazy. Which should I 
admit to? 

If I admitted I was up to something, I’d have to tell her about the mermaid 
—and I couldn’t do that. 

“Okay,” I said with a casual shrug. “I guess I’m crazy.” 

“Well, big news,” she muttered sarcastically. “Come on back to the boat, 
Billy,” said Sheena. “Dr. D. will be looking for us.” 

“You go back. I’ll be there in a little while.” 

“Billy,” said Sheena. “Dr. D. is going to be very mad. He’s probably ready 
to hop in the dinghy and search for us right now.” 

I was about to give up and go with her. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I 
saw a big splash on the other side of the reef. 

The mermaid! I thought. That’s got to be her! If I don’t go look for her now, 
I might miss her! 



I turned away from Sheena and started swimming very fast, straight for the 

reef. 

I could hear Sheena screaming, “Billy! Come back! Billy!” 

I thought I heard an extra note of panic in her voice, but I ignored it. Just 
Sheena trying to scare me again, I thought. 

“Billy!” she screamed again. “Billy!” I kept on swimming. No way I was 
going to stop now. But as it turned out, I should have listened to her. 



11 


Swimming fast, I raised my head, searching for a good place to swim safely over 
the fire coral. 

I saw another splash. Across the lagoon. Near the shore. 

That’s got to be the mermaid! I thought excitedly. 

I stared hard, trying to catch a glimpse of her. 

I thought I saw some kind of fin. 

I made my way past the reef into the deep, still waters of the lagoon. I 
strained to see the mermaid, but my mask had fogged. 

Rats! I thought. What a time for my mask to start leaking! 

I came up for air and pulled off the mask. I hoped I wouldn’t lose sight of 
the mermaid because of this. 

I wiped the water from my eyes and, leaving the mask wrapped around my 
wrist, stared toward the lagoon. 

That’s when I saw it. A few hundred yards away. 

Not the green fish tail of a mermaid. 

The fin I saw was a gray-white triangle sticking straight up in the water. 

The fin of a hammerhead shark. 

As I stared in horror, the fin turned in the water, and then ripped toward me, 
moving steady and straight as a torpedo. 



12 


Where was Sheena? 

Was she still behind me? 

I glanced back. I could see her in the distance, splashing back to the boat. 

I was forced to forget about Sheena as the gray fin swiftly moved closer. 

I thrashed my arms in the water, trying to swim away. 

When the shark swam right past me, I stopped thrashing. 

Would it go away? Would it leave me alone? 

My heart in my throat, I started swimming in the other direction, toward the 
reef. Away from the shark. 

I kept my eyes on that fin. 

It began to turn. The shark’s fin streamed toward me in a wide arc. 

“Ohhh.” I let out a terrified groan as I realized it was circling me. 

Now I didn’t know which way to go. The shark swam between me and the 
boat. If I could turn around and climb on to the reef, maybe I would be safe. 

The huge fin slid closer. 

I plunged toward the reef. I knew I had to keep distance between me and 
the shark. 

Suddenly, the fin shot up in front of me—between me and the reef. 

The shark kept circling, closing in, swimming faster and faster, making the 
circle smaller as he swam. 

I was trapped. But I couldn’t stay still. I couldn’t just float there, waiting for 
the shark to eat me. 

I had to fight. I kicked my legs in a panic as I swam toward the reef. 

I was nearer to the reef now. But the shark’s circles grew smaller, smaller. 

I breathed in quick, shallow gasps. I couldn’t think clearly. I was too 
terrified. The same two words echoed in my brain: The shark. The shark. 

Over and over again. The shark. The shark. 

The shark swam around me in a tight circle. His tail swished, sending up 
waves of water over me. 

The shark. The shark. 

I stared at the monster in wide-eyed horror. He swam so close, I could see 



him clearly. He was big—at least ten feet long. His head was wide and hideous, 
long like the head of a hammer, with an eye on each end. 

I heard my voice quivering, “No... no...” 

Something cold brushed my leg. 

The shark. The shark. 

My stomach lurched. I threw my head back and let out a howl of sheer 
terror. 

“Aaaaaiiii!” 

Pain jolted down my spine. 

The shark had bumped me with its snout. My body rose out of the water, 
then hit the surface with a smack. 

I froze. 

The shark was hungry. 

It wanted to fight. 

It circled me again, then zoomed straight for me. 

Its jaws opened. I saw rows and rows of sharp teeth. 

I screamed out a hoarse, “NO!” I thrashed, panicked. I kicked with all my 
strength. 

The razor teeth brushed by, just missing my leg. 

The reef. I had to get to the reef. It was my only chance. 

I dove for the coral. The shark plunged toward me. I dodged it once more. 

I grabbed the red coral. Pain shot through my hand. The fire coral. 

I didn’t care. 

The top of the reef sat just above the surface of the water. I tried to pull 
myself up. My whole body stung. 

I had almost made it. Soon I’d be safe. 

With a mighty kick, I hoisted myself onto the reef—and was yanked back 
into the water. 

My stomach slammed against the side of the reef. I felt a sharp stab of pain 
in my leg. 

I tried to pull my leg away. I couldn’t. 

It was caught in the jaws of the shark. 

My mind screamed with terror. 

The shark. The shark. 

It’s got me! 



13 


My entire body burned with pain. I slipped heavily into the water. 

The shark knew he had me. I had no strength left to fight. 

Then something splashed nearby. 

The shark released my leg and jerked toward the splash. 

I had no time to catch my breath. The shark circled back. It charged at me. 

The gaping jaws moved in for the kill. 

I shut my eyes and let out a shrill scream of terror. 

A second passed. Then another. 

Nothing happened. 

I heard a loud thump. 

I opened my eyes. 

Something had come between me and the shark, a few feet in front of me. 

I stared. The water churned white. A long, shiny green fish tail rose out of 
the water and splashed back down. 

Another fish was fighting the shark! 

The shark rolled over, then attacked. The green fish tail smacked the shark 
hard. The shark went under. 

I couldn’t see what was happening. The water rocked higher, tossing up 
frothy, white waves. 

All around me the water bubbled and churned, white with foam. Over the 
crash of the water, I heard shrill animal squeals. 

Sharks don’t squeal, do they? I thought. What is making that sound? 

The shark surfaced, its toothy jaws gaping. It snapped them at something, 
once, twice. Snapping at air. 

The long, green fish tail rose out of the water and smacked the shark hard. 
A direct hit on its broad hammerhead. 

The shark shut its jaws and sank below the surface. 

Then I heard a loud bump! The water stopped churning. 

A second later, the huge gray fin surfaced a few yards away, speeding off in 
the other direction. 

The shark was swimming away! 



I stared at the green fish tail as it arced over the dark, swelling water. 

As the waters calmed, I heard a low, musical sound. It was beautiful and 
slightly sad. Whistling and humming at the same time. 

It sounded something like a whale. But this creature was much smaller than 
a whale. 

The green tail swung around. Then the creature lifted its head. 

A head with long, blond hair. 

The mermaid! 



14 


Bobbing in the water, I forgot my burning pain as I gaped at her. 

To my amazement, the mermaid looked just as the zoo people had said she 
would. 

Her head and shoulders were smaller than mine, but her flashing green tail 
stretched out, long and powerful. Her wide, sea-green eyes sparkled. Her skin 
gave off a pale pink glow. 

I stared at her, unable to speak. 

She’s real! I thought. And she’s so beautiful! 

At last I found my voice. “You—you saved me,” I stammered. “You saved 
my life. Thank you!” 

She shyly lowered her eyes and cooed at me through shell-pink lips. What 
was she trying to say? 

“What can I do in return?” I asked her. “I’ll do anything I can.” 

She smiled, and uttered that haunting low hum. 

She was trying to talk to me. I wished I could understand her. 

She reached for my hand and examined it, frowning over the red burns from 
the fire coral. Her hand felt cool. She passed it over the palm of my hand, and 
the pain from the burns began to fade away. 

“Wow!” I exclaimed. I must have sounded pretty stupid, but I didn’t know 
what else to say. Her touch was like magic. When she held my hand, I could 
float without treading water. Just as she did. 

Was this another dream? 

I closed my eyes and opened them again. 

I was still floating in the sea, staring at a blond-haired mermaid. 

No. Not a dream. 

She smiled again and shook her head, making those low singing sounds. 

I could hardly believe that only a few minutes before I’d been frantically 
fighting off a hungry shark. 

I raised my head and searched the waters. The shark had vanished. The 
water had calmed, shimmering like gold now under the morning sunlight. And 
there I was, floating in the sea off a deserted island with a real mermaid. 

Sheena will never believe this, I thought. Not in a million years. 



Suddenly, the mermaid flipped her tail and disappeared under the water. 

Startled, I searched around for her. She had left without a trace—not a 
ripple, not a bubble. 

Where did she go? I wondered. Is she gone, just like that? Will I never see 
her again? 

I rubbed my eyes and looked for her again. No sign of her. A few fish 
darted past me. 

She had disappeared so instantly, I began to think I had dreamed her up 
after all. 

Just then, I felt a tiny pinch on my foot. 

“Ouch!” I yelled, quickly pulling away. I began to panic. The shark was 
back! 

Then, behind me, I heard a small splash and a whistlelike giggle. I turned 
around. 

The mermaid smiled mischievously at me. She snapped her fingers in a 
pinching motion. 

“It was you!” I cried, laughing with relief. “You’re worse than my little 
sister!” 

She whistled again and slapped her tail against the surface of the water. 

Suddenly, a dark shadow fell across her face. I raised my eyes to see what it 

was. 

Too late. 

A heavy net dropped over us. Startled, I thrashed my arms and legs. But 
that only tangled them more in the rope. 

The net tightened over both of us. We were thrown together. 

We struggled helplessly as the net jerked us up. 

The mermaid’s eyes widened and she squealed in terror. 

“EEEEEE!” she cried. 

We were being pulled up out of the water. 

“EEEEEEE!” The mermaid’s frightened wail rose like a siren, drowning 
out my feeble cries for help. 



15 


“Billy—I don’t believe it!” 

I gazed up through the holes in the net and recognized Dr. D. and Sheena. 
They struggled to pull us aboard the dinghy. 

Sheena stared down at me and the mermaid in amazement. Dr. D.’s eyes 
were wide, and his mouth hung open. 

“You’ve found her, Billy!” he said. “You’ve actually found the mermaid!” 

“Just get me out of this net!” I cried. Somehow, I didn’t feel so great about 
capturing the mermaid anymore. 

“The zoo people were right,” Dr. D. muttered to himself. “It’s unbelievable. 
It’s astounding. It’s historic....” 

We landed in a heap on the floor of the dinghy. The mermaid squirmed 
beside me in the net, making sharp, angry clicking noises. 

Dr. D. watched her closely. He touched her tail. 

The mermaid flapped it hard against the bottom of the boat. 

“Is there any way this could be a hoax?” he wondered aloud. 

“Billy—is this one of your dumb tricks?” Sheena demanded suspiciously. 

“It’s not a trick,” I said. “Now will you get me out of this net? The ropes are 
digging into my skin.” 

They ignored me. 

Sheena gently reached one finger through the net and touched the scales on 
the mermaid’s tail. “I can’t believe it,” she murmured. “She’s really real!” 

“Of course she’s real!” I cried. “We’re both real, and we’re both very 
uncomfortable!” 

“Well, it’s hard to believe anything you say,” Sheena snapped. “After all, 
you’ve been talking about sea monsters ever since we got here.” 

“I did see a sea monster!” I cried. 

“Quiet, kids,” said Dr. D. “Let’s get our discovery back to the sea lab.” 

He started the dinghy’s motor and we roared back to the big boat. 

Alexander stood on deck, waiting for us. “It’s really true!” he cried 
excitedly. “It’s really a mermaid!” 

Sheena tied the dinghy to the side of the Cassandra while Dr. D. and 



Alexander hoisted me and the mermaid aboard. 

Dr. D. opened the net and helped me out. The mermaid flopped her tail and 
got herself even more tangled in the net. 

Alexander shook my hand. “I’m proud of you, Billy. How did you do it? 
This is amazing.” He gave me a vigorous pat on the back. “Do you realize this is 
the greatest ocean find of the century? Maybe of all time?” 

“Thanks,” I said. “But I didn’t do anything. I didn’t find her —she found 

me. ” 

The mermaid flopped violently on deck. Her squeals became higher- 
pitched, more frantic. 

Alexander’s face fell. “We’ve got to do something for her,” he said 
urgently. 

“Dr. D., you’ve got to let her go,” I said. “She needs to be in the water.” 

“I’ll fill the big tank with seawater, Dr. D.,” said Alexander. He hurried off 
to fill the tank. 

“We can’t let her go just yet, Billy,” said Dr. D. “Not without examining her 
first.” His eyes were shining with excitement. But he saw how upset I was. “We 
won’t hurt her, Billy. She’ll be all right.” 

His eyes dropped to my leg, and he frowned. He kneeled down to look at it. 

“You’re bleeding, Billy,” he said. “Are you okay?” 

“I’m fine,” I said. “But the mermaid isn’t.” 

He ignored me. 

“How did this happen?” asked Dr. D. 

“A shark grabbed my leg,” I told him. “Just as he was about to clamp down, 
the mermaid came. She saved my life. You should have seen her fighting that 
shark.” 

Dr. D. turned to the mermaid as if seeing her for the first time. 

“Wow,” said Sheena. “She fought off a shark? All by herself?” 

The mermaid’s long green tail pounded angrily on the deck of the boat. 

“EEEEE! EEEEEE!” she cried shrilly. She almost sounded as if she were 
screaming. 

“Forget about my leg,” I shouted. “You’ve got to let the mermaid go!” 

Dr. D. stood up, shaking his head. “Billy, I’m a scientist. This mermaid is 
an extremely important discovery. If I let her go, I’d be letting down the entire 
scientific community. I’d be letting down the entire world!” 

“You just want the million dollars,” I muttered. 



I knew it was cruel, but I couldn’t stop myself. I hated seeing the mermaid 
so unhappy. 

Dr. D. looked hurt. 

“That’s not fair, Billy,” he said. “I think you know me better than that.” 

I avoided his gaze. Lowering my head, I pretended to examine the cut on 
my leg. It wasn’t very deep. Alexander had given me some gauze. I pressed it 
against the cut. 

“I only want the money to continue my research,” Dr. D. went on. “I would 
never use this mermaid to get rich.” 

That was true. I knew Dr. D. didn’t care about the money for himself. All he 
wanted was to keep on studying fish. 

“Just think about it, Billy. You’ve found a mermaid! A creature we all 
thought didn’t exist! We can’t just let her go. We’ve got to find out a little bit 
about her,” he said excitedly. 

I said nothing. 

“We won’t hurt her, Billy. I promise.” 

Alexander returned. “The tank is ready, Dr. D.” 

“Thanks.” Dr. D. followed him to the other side of the boat. 

I glanced at Sheena to see whose side she was on. Did she want to keep the 
mermaid? Or let her go? 

But Sheena just stood there, watching. Her face was tense. I could tell she 
wasn’t sure which of us was right. 

But when I looked at the mermaid, I knew I was right. 

She had finally stopped squirming and flipping her tail. Now she lay still on 
the deck, the net draped over her. She was breathing hard and staring out at the 
ocean with watery, sad eyes. 

I wished I’d never tried to find her in the first place. Now all I wanted was 
to find some way to help her get back to her home. 

Dr. D. and Alexander came back. They lifted the mermaid inside the net. 
Alexander lifted her tail, and Dr. D. held her head. 

“Don’t squirm, little mermaid,” Dr. D. said in a soothing voice. “Keep 
still.” 

The mermaid seemed to understand. She didn’t flop around. But her eyes 
rolled wildly, and she uttered low moans. 

Dr. D. and Alexander carried her to the giant glass tank. It stood on the deck 
now, full of fresh seawater. They gently dropped her into the tank, pulling the net 



away as she slid into the water. Then they put a screen top over the tank and 
clamped it shut. 

The mermaid churned the water with her tail. Then, gradually, her tail 
stopped moving. She grew still. 

Her body slumped lifelessly to the bottom of the tank. 

She didn’t move or breathe. 

“Noooo!” An angry cry escaped my lips. “She’s dead! She’s dead! We 
killed her!” 



16 


Sheena had moved to the other side of the tank. “Billy, look—!” she called to 
me. 

I hurried around to her. 

“The mermaid isn’t dead,” Sheena reported, pointing. “Look. She—she’s 
crying or something.” 

My sister was right. The mermaid had slumped to the bottom of the tank 
and had buried her face in her hands. “Now what do we do?” I asked. 

No one answered. 

“We have to find a method of feeding her,” my uncle said, rubbing his chin, 
his eyes on the tank. 

“Do you think she eats like a person or a fish?” I asked. 

“If only she could tell us,” said Alexander. “She can’t talk, can she, Billy?” 

“I don’t think so,” I said. “She just makes sounds. Whistles and clicks and 
hums.” 

“I’ll go down to the lab and get some equipment ready,” said Alexander. 
“Maybe we can find out something about her with the sonar monitor.” 

“Good idea,” said Dr. D. thoughtfully. 

Alexander hurried below. 

“I think I’d better go to Santa Anita for some supplies,” said Dr. D. Santa 
Anita was the nearest inhabited island. “I’ll buy lots of different kinds of foods. 
We can try them out on her until we find something she likes. Would you two 
like anything while I’m there?” 

“How about some peanut butter?” Sheena asked quickly. “There’s no way 
Alexander can ruin a peanut butter sandwich!” 

Dr. D. nodded as he climbed into the dinghy. “Peanut butter it is. Anything 
else? Billy?” 

I shook my head. 

“All right,” Dr. D. said. “I’ll be back in a few hours.” 

He started the motor, and the dinghy sped off toward Santa Anita. 

“It’s so hot,” Sheena complained. “I’m going down to my cabin for a 
while.” 

“Okay,” I said, my eyes on the mermaid. 



It was hot up on deck. There was no breeze, and the white-hot noon sun 
beat down on my face. 

But I couldn’t go below deck. I couldn’t leave the mermaid. 

She floated behind the glass, her long tail drooping. When she saw me, she 
pressed her hands and face to the glass and cooed sadly. 

I waved to her through the glass. 

She cooed and hummed in her low voice, trying to communicate with me. I 
listened, trying to understand. 

“Are you hungry?” I asked her. 

She stared at me blankly. 

“Are you hungry?” I repeated, rubbing my stomach. “Go like this”—I 
nodded my head up and down—“for yes. Do this for no.” I shook my head back 
and forth. 

I stopped and waited to see what she’d do. 

She nodded her head yes. 

“Yes?” I said. “You are hungry?” 

She shook her head no. 

“No? You’re not hungry?” 

She nodded her head yes. Then she shook her head no again. 

She’s just copying me, I thought. She doesn’t really understand. 

I took a step back and studied her in the tank. 

She’s young, I thought. She’s a lot like me. That means she must be hungry. 
And she probably likes to eat what I like. Right? 

Maybe. It was worth a try. 

I hurried down to the galley. I pulled open a cupboard and took out a 
package of chocolate chip cookies. 

Okay, so it’s not exactly seafood, I thought. But who wouldn’t like 
chocolate chip cookies? 

I grabbed a few cookies and stuffed the package back in the cupboard. 
Alexander came through on his way up to the deck. He was carrying some 
equipment in his arms. 

“Getting a snack?” he asked me. 

“For the mermaid,” I told him. “Do you think she’ll like them?” 

He shrugged his broad shoulders and said, “Who knows?” 

He followed me out on deck, carrying the equipment. 

“What’s all that stuff?” I asked him. 



“I thought we could run a few tests on the mermaid, to see what we can find 
out about her,” said Alexander. “But go ahead and feed her first.” 

“Okay,” I said. “Here goes.” 

I held a cookie up to the glass. The mermaid stared at it. I could see that she 
didn’t know what it was. 

“Mmmmm,” I said, patting my stomach. “Yummy.” 

The mermaid patted her tummy, imitating me. She stared out at me blankly 
with those sea-green eyes. 

Alexander reached up and unlatched the screen top. I handed him the 
cookie, and he dropped it into the tank. 

The mermaid watched it falling toward her through the water. She made no 
attempt to grab it. 

By the time it reached her, it was soggy. It fell apart in the tank. 

“Yuck,” I said. “Even I wouldn’t eat it now.” 

The mermaid pushed the soggy cookie pieces away. 

“Maybe Dr. D. will have something she likes when he gets back,” said 
Alexander. 

“I hope so,” I said. 

Alexander began to set up his equipment. He put a thermometer inside the 
tank, and some long white plastic tubes. 

“Oh, man,” Alexander mumbled, shaking his head. “I forgot my notebook.” 

He hurried back down to the lab. 

I watched the mermaid float sadly in her tank, with all the tubes coming out 
of it. She reminded me of the fish down in the lab. 

No, I thought. She’s not a fish. She shouldn’t be treated this way. 

I remembered how she had fought the shark. 

She could have been killed, I thought. Easily. But she fought the shark, 
anyway, just to help me. 

The mermaid cooed. Then I saw her wipe away the tears that had begun to 
mn down her face. 

She’s crying again, I thought, feeling guilty and miserable. She’s pleading 
with me. I put my face against the glass, as close to hers as I could get it. 

I’ve got to help her, I thought. 

I put a finger to my lips. “Ssshhh,” I whispered. “Stay quiet. I have to work 
quickly!” 

I knew I was about to do something that would make Dr. D. very angry. 



My uncle would probably never forgive me. 
But I didn’t care. 

I was going to do what I thought was right. 

I was going to set the mermaid free. 



17 


My hand trembled as I reached up to unlatch the screen at the top of the tank. 
The tank was taller than I was. I wasn’t quite sure how I’d get the mermaid out 
of there. But I had to find a way. 

As I struggled to pull the screen off, the mermaid began to squeal, “Eeee! 
EEEEEE!” 

“Sshh! Don’t make any noise!” I warned her. 

Then I felt a hand grab me by the arm. I gasped, startled. 

A deep voice asked, “What are you doing?” 

I turned around to see Alexander standing behind me. 

I stepped away from the tank, and he let go of my arm. 

“Billy, what were you doing?” he asked again. 

“I was going to let her go!” I cried. “Alexander, you can’t keep her in there! 
Look how unhappy she is!” 

We both stared at the mermaid, who had slumped to the bottom of the tank 
again. I think she knew that I had tried to help her—and that I had been stopped. 

I caught the sadness on Alexander’s face. I could tell he felt sorry for her. 
But he had a job to do. 

He turned to me and put an arm around my shoulders. “Billy, you’ve got to 
understand how important this mermaid is to your uncle,” he said. “He’s worked 
his whole life for a discovery like this. It would break his heart if you let her go.” 

He slowly led me away from the tank. I turned back to look at the mermaid 
again. 

“But what about her heart?” I asked. “I think it’s breaking her heart to be 
stuck in that fish tank.” 

Alexander sighed. “It’s not ideal, I know that. But it’s only temporary. Soon 
she’ll have plenty of room to swim and play in.” 

Sure, I thought bitterly. As an exhibit at the zoo, with millions of people 
gawking at her every day. 

Alexander removed his arm from my shoulders and rubbed his chin. 

“Your uncle is a very caring man, Billy,” he said. “He’ll do his best to make 
sure the mermaid has everything she needs. But it’s his duty to study her. The 
things he can learn from her could help people understand the oceans better— 



and take better care of them. That’s important, right?” 

“I guess so,” I said. 

I knew Alexander had a good point. I loved Dr. D., and I didn’t want to 
spoil his big discovery. 

But, still, the mermaid shouldn’t have to suffer for science, I thought. 

“Come on, Billy,” Alexander said, leading me below deck. “I promised you 
I’d show you how the sonar probes work, didn’t I? Let’s go down to the lab, and 
I’ll give you a demonstration.” 

As we started to climb below, I took one last glance back at the mermaid. 
She was still slumped forlornly at the bottom of the tank. Her head was lowered, 
her blond hair floating limply above it like seaweed. 

The sonar probes weren’t as interesting as I thought they’d be. All they did was 
beep whenever the Cassandra was in danger of running ashore. 

I guess Alexander could tell my mind was not on the sonar probes. “Want 
some lunch?” he asked me. 

Uh-oh. Lunch. I was hungry. But not for spicy chicken salad. 

I hesitated. “Well, I had a big breakfast....” 

“I’ll whip up something special,” Alexander offered. “We can have a picnic 
up on deck with the mermaid. Come on.” 

What could I do? I followed him to the kitchen. 

He opened the small refrigerator and pulled out a bowl. 

“This has been marinating all morning,” he said. 

I looked into the bowl. It was full of thin strips of something white and 
mbbery-looking. They floated in an oily, dark gray liquid. 

Whatever it was, I knew I couldn’t eat it. 

“It’s marinated squid,” said Alexander. “I added some squid ink for extra 
flavor. That’s what makes it gray.” 

“Yum,” I said, rolling my eyes. “I haven’t had squid ink in days!” 

“Don’t be so sarcastic. You might be surprised,” Alexander replied. He 
handed me the bowl. “Take this up on deck. I’ll bring some bread and iced tea.” 

I carried the bowl of squid up and set it down near the mermaid’s tank. 

“How are you doing, Mermaid?” I asked her. 

She flipped her tail a little. Then she opened and closed her mouth, as if she 
were chewing. 

“Hey,” I said. “You are hungry, aren’t you?” 



She kept making that chewing motion. I glanced down at the bowl of squid. 
Who knows? I thought. This might be just what she’d like. 

I stood on a rail and unlatched the top of the tank. Then I dropped in a piece 
of the rubbery squid. 

The mermaid leaped toward it and caught it in her mouth. 

She chewed, then smiled. 

She liked it! 

I gave her some more. She ate it. 

I rubbed my stomach. “Do you like it?” I asked her. I nodded yes. 

She smiled again. Then she nodded yes. 

She understood me! 

“What are you doing, Billy?” Alexander asked. He had come up on deck 
carrying two plates and a loaf of bread. 

“Alexander, look!” I cried. “We communicated!” 

I dropped another piece of squid into the tank. She ate it. Then she nodded 

yes. 

“That means she likes it!” I said. 

“Wow,” murmured Alexander. He put down the plates and picked up his 
notebook. He scribbled some notes. 

“Isn’t that way cool?” I demanded. “I’m a scientist, too—aren’t I, 
Alexander?” 

He nodded, but kept writing. 

“I mean, I’m the first person on Earth to communicate with a mermaid— 
right?” I insisted. 

“If she stays with us long enough, you might be able to talk to her in sign 
language,” he said. “Just think of the things we could learn!” 

He spoke aloud as he wrote, “Likes to eat squid.” Then he put down his 
pencil and said, “Hey, wait! That’s our lunch!” 

Uh-oh, I thought. I hope his feelings aren’t hurt. 

He looked at me. He looked at the bowl. He looked at the mermaid. 

Then he started laughing. 

“At least somebody around here likes my cooking!” he exclaimed. 

About an hour later, Dr. D. returned with the groceries and supplies. Luckily he 
had bought plenty of seafood in Santa Anita. We fed some of it to the mermaid 
for supper. While she ate, Dr. D. checked the readings on the meters Alexander 



had set up in the tank. 

“Interesting,” Dr. D. commented. “She sends out sonar signals through the 
water. Just as whales do.” 

“What does that mean?” asked Sheena. 

“It means there are probably other mermaids like her,” said Dr. D. “She 
must be trying to contact them with underwater sounds.” 

Poor mermaid, I thought. She’s calling to her friends. She wants to be 
rescued. 

I went to my cabin after supper and stared out of the little porthole. 

An orange sun sank slowly into the purple horizon. A wide carpet of gold 
light shimmered in the rolling ocean waters. A cool breeze blew in through the 
porthole. 

I watched the sun drop into the ocean. The sky immediately darkened, as if 
someone had turned off a lamp. 

The mermaid is up there all alone, I thought. She must be so frightened. A 
prisoner. Trapped in a fish tank in the dark. 

The door to my cabin suddenly burst open. Sheena bounded in, panting, her 
eyes wide. 

“Sheena!” I scolded angrily. “How many times do I have to tell you to 
knock first?” 

She ignored me. “But, Billy!” she gasped. “She’s escaped! The mermaid 
escaped!” 



18 


I leaped off my bed, my heart pounding. 

“She’s not there!” Sheena cried. “She’s not in her tank!” 

I darted out of the cabin, up the hatch, and out on deck. 

Part of me hoped she really had escaped to freedom. But part of me wished 
she could stay forever—and make my uncle the most famous scientist in the 
world and me the most famous nephew of a scientist! 

Please let her be okay, I thought. 

Up on deck, my eyes adjusted to the evening darkness. Tiny lights glowed 
all around the edge of the boat. 

I squinted across the deck at the giant fish tank. 

I ran so fast, I nearly toppled overboard. Sheena was right behind me. 

“Hey—!” I cried out when I saw the mermaid floating listlessly in the 
water, her green tail shimmering faintly in the fading light. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that Sheena was laughing. “Gotcha!” 
she shouted gleefully. “Gotcha again, Billy!” 

I groaned long and loud. Another one of Sheena’s stupid tricks. 

“Good one, Sheena,” I said bitterly. “Very clever.” 

“You’re just mad because I fooled you again. You’re so easy to trick.” 

The mermaid raised her eyes to me, and a faint smile formed on her pale 
lips. “Looorrrooo, looorrrooo,” she cooed at me. 

“She really is pretty,” Sheena said. 

The mermaid is hoping I’ll let her go now, I thought. Maybe I should.... 

Sheena could help me, I decided. It would be easier with two of us. 

But would my sister cooperate? “Sheena—”1 began. 

I heard footsteps behind us. “Hey, kids.” It was Dr. D. “It’s almost 
bedtime,” he called. “Ready to go below?” 

“We never go to bed this early at home,” Sheena whined. 

“Maybe not. But I bet you don’t get up so early at home, either. Do you?” 

Sheena shook her head. We all stood at the tank and watched the mermaid 
in silence. She gave her tail a little flick and settled back down at the bottom of 
the tank. 



“Don’t worry about her,” Dr. D. said. “I’ll check on her during the night to 
make sure she’s all right.” 

The mermaid pressed her tiny hands against the glass wall of the tank. Her 
eyes pleaded with us, pleaded with us to set her free. 

“She’ll feel better once she gets to Marina Zoo,” Dr. D. said. “They’re 
building a special lagoon just for her, with a reef and everything. It’ll be exactly 
like the lagoon off Ilandra. She’ll be free to swim and play. She’ll feel at home.” 

I hope so, I thought. But I didn’t feel so sure. 

The Cassandra rocked gently on the waves that night, but I couldn’t fall asleep. 

I lay on my bunk, staring at the ceiling. A pale beam of moonlight fell 
through the porthole and across my face. I couldn’t stop thinking about the 
mermaid. 

I tried to imagine what it would feel like to be trapped in a glass tank for a 
whole day. It probably wouldn’t be that different from being trapped in this tiny 
cabin, I thought, glancing around. My cabin was about as big as a closet. 

It would be terrible, I thought, fiddling with the collar of my pajama top. I 
pushed open the porthole to let in more air. 

The fish tank might not even be the worst of it, I figured. I know Dr. D. 
cares about the mermaid. I know he’d never hurt her. 

But what will happen to her when the zoo people take her away? Who will 
look out for her? 

Sure, they’re building a fancy fake lagoon. But it won’t be the same as the 
real lagoon. And there will be people around, staring at her all the time. They’ll 
probably expect her to perform tricks or something; maybe jump through hoops 
like a trained seal. 

They’ll probably put her in TV commercials, too. And TV shows and 
movies. 

She’ll be a prisoner. A lonely prisoner for the rest of her life. 

This is all my fault. How could I let this happen? 

I have to do something, I decided. I can’t let them take her. 

Just then I thought I heard something—a low hum. I lay very still and 
listened. At first I thought it was the mermaid. But I quickly realized it was a 
motor. 

I heard it chugging softly, from a distance. But slowly the sound moved 
closer. 



A boat. 

I sat up and peered out of the porthole. A large boat pulled quietly up beside 
the Cassandra. 

Who was it? The zoo people? 

In the middle of the night? 

No. It wasn’t the same boat. This boat was much bigger. 

As I peered out the small porthole, I saw two dark figures quietly slip on 
board the Cassandra. Then two more. 

My heart began to race. Who are these people? I wondered. What are they 
doing? 

What should I do? 

Should I sneak up and spy on them? What if they see me? 

Then I heard more strange noises. 

A thud. A muffled cry of pain. 

It came from the deck. 

The deck. Where the mermaid was trapped helplessly in her tank. 

Oh, no! I thought, feeling a chill of panic. They’re hurting the mermaid! 



19 


I charged up to the deck. Sheena ran right behind me. 

Stumbling over a tow rope, I grabbed the rail to steady myself. Then I 
darted blindly to the fish tank. 

The mermaid huddled at the bottom of the tank, her arms wrapped 
protectively around herself. 

I saw four men standing tensely near the tank. All four were dressed in 
black. They had black masks pulled over their faces. 

One of the men held a small club in his hand. 

And a body lay sprawled on the deck, face down. 

Dr. D.! 

Sheena screamed and ran to our uncle. She knelt beside him. “They hit him 
on the head!” she cried. “They knocked him out!” 

I gasped. “Who are you?” I demanded. “What are you doing on our boat?” 

The four men ignored me. 

Two of them unfolded a heavy rope net and spread it over the fish tank. 
Then they let it fall into the tank, draping it over the mermaid. 

“Stop it!” I yelled. “What are you doing?” 

“Be quiet, kid,” the man with the club muttered. He raised the club 
menacingly. 

I watched helplessly as they tightened the net around the mermaid. 

They were kidnapping her! 

“Eeeee! EEEEEeeee!” she squealed in terror and started to thrash her arms, 
struggling to free herself from the heavy net. 

“Stop it! Leave her alone!” I cried. 

One of the men gave a low laugh. The other three still ignored me. 

Sheena was bent over Dr. D., frantically trying to wake him up. I ran to the 
hatch and shouted down into the cabin, “Alexander! Alexander! Help!” 

Alexander was big and strong—maybe strong enough to stop these men. 

I ran back to the tank. The mermaid was trapped in the net. All four men 
worked to lift her out of the tank. She squirmed and fought with all her strength. 

“EEEEEE!” she screamed. The high-pitched squeal hurt my ears. 



“Can’t you get her to shut up?” one of the men cried angrily. 

“Just load her on board,” the one with the club replied sharply. 

“Stop!” I yelled. “You can’t do that!” 

Then I totally lost it. 

Without thinking, I dove toward the four of them. I don’t know what I 
planned to do. I just knew I had to stop them. 

One of them pushed me away easily with one hand. “Stay away—or you’ll 
get hurt,” he muttered. 

“Let her go! Let the mermaid go!” I cried frantically. 

“Forget about the mermaid,” said the man. “You’ll never see her again.” 

I grabbed the rail. My heart was pounding in my chest. I gasped for breath. 

I couldn’t stand the mermaid’s terrified screams. 

I couldn’t let them take her—not without a fight. 

She had saved my life once. Now it was my turn to save hers. 

But what could I do? 

They had lifted the mermaid out of the tank. Three men held her in the net. 
She squirmed and thrashed like crazy, splashing water all over the deck. 

I’ll tackle them, I thought. I’ll knock them over. Then I’ll push the mermaid 
into the ocean and she can swim away to safety. 

Lowering my head like a football player, I took a deep breath and ran right 
at them. 



20 


“Billy—stop!” Sheena screamed. 

I crashed into one of the men holding the net, butting him hard in the 
stomach with my head. 

To my dismay, the man hardly moved. 

He grabbed me with his free hand, lifted me up off the deck, and heaved me 
into the fish tank. 

I splashed into the warm water and came up, choking and sputtering. 

Through the glass, I watched the men toss the mermaid aboard their boat. 
They were getting away! 

I tried to scramble out of the tank, but it was too tall. I kept slipping down 
the wet glass, unable to reach the top. 

I knew there was only one person who could stop the masked men now. 
Alexander. 

Where was he? Hadn’t he heard all the noise? 

“ALEXANDER!” I shouted as loud as I could. But my voice was muffled 
by the glass walls of the tank. 

Then, finally, he appeared on the deck. I saw his big blond head and 
muscular body moving toward me. At last! 

“Alexander!” I cried, scrambling to stay afloat in the tank. “Stop them!” 

I could hear the motor of the other boat begin to rumble. One by one, the 
masked men lowered themselves off our boat. 

Three of them had left the Cassandra. Only one remained on deck. 

Through the glass I watched Alexander run up to him and grab his shoulder. 

Yes! I thought. Get him, Alexander! Get him! 

I’d never seen Alexander hit anyone before. But I knew he could do it if he 
had to. 

But Alexander didn’t hit the masked man. Instead, he asked, “Is the 
mermaid safely on board?” 

The masked man nodded. 

“Good,” Alexander replied. “And have you got the money for me?” 

“Got it.” 



“All right,” Alexander murmured. “Let’s get out of here!” 



21 


I nearly choked on a mouthful of water. 

I just couldn’t believe that Alexander was working with the masked men. 
He had seemed like such a good guy. 

But I knew now that he had arranged the whole thing. He had to be the one 
who had told them the mermaid was on board our boat. 

“Alexander,” I cried, “how could you?” 

He stared at me through the glass. “Hey, Billy, it’s just business,” he said 
with a shrug. “The zoo was going to pay a million dollars for the mermaid. But 
my new bosses will pay twenty million!” A thin smile crossed his face. “You 
know arithmetic, Billy. Which would you choose?” 

“You rat!” I shouted. I wanted to punch him. I stmggled to get out of the 
tank. All I managed to do was splash a lot and get water up my nose. 

Alexander followed the masked man to his boat. I pounded helplessly on 
the glass tank. 

Then I saw Sheena stand up. Lowering my gaze to the deck, I saw that Dr. 
D. was moving. 

Alexander didn’t seem to notice. He stepped over Dr. D.’s body. He didn’t 
even care that Dr. D. could have been hurt badly. 

I watched my uncle reach up and grab Alexander by the ankle. 

“Whoa!” Alexander tripped and fell hard onto his elbows and his knees. 

Sheena screamed and backed up to the rail. 

Maybe there’s still hope, I thought, my heart beating faster. Maybe they 
won’t get away after all. 

Alexander sat up, dazed, rubbing one elbow. “Get them!” he shouted down 
to the masked men. 

Two of the men climbed back aboard the Cassandra and grabbed Dr. D. 
Sheena ran at them, flailing at them with her puny little fists. 

Of course that didn’t do any good. The third masked man grabbed her arms 
and pinned them behind her back. 

“Kick him, Sheena!” I yelled through the glass. 

She tried to kick the man who held her, but he just tightened his grip. She 
couldn’t move. 



“Let them go!” I screamed desperately. 

“What should we do with them?” asked one of the men. 

“Whatever you do, do it quickly,” said Alexander. “We’ve got to get out of 
here.” 

The man who held Sheena glanced in at me. I was frantically treading 
water, trying to stay above the surface. 

“They might call the island police or the Coast Guard,” he said, frowning. 
“We’d better kill them.” 

“Throw them all in the tank!” suggested one of his partners. 



22 


“Alexander!” Dr. D. shouted. “I know you’re not a cruel man. Don’t let them do 
this.” 

Alexander avoided my uncle’s hard stare. “Sorry, Dr. D.,” he muttered. “I 
can’t stop them. If I try to, they’ll kill me, too.” 

Without another word, he lowered himself onto the other boat. 

What a creep, I thought angrily. 

Two of the masked men lifted Dr. D. up high and dropped him into the tank. 
He landed beside me with a splash. 

“Are you okay?” I asked him. 

He rubbed the back of his head and nodded. 

Sheena was next. They tossed her in easily. She flew through the air, 
flailing her arms and legs. Then she plopped into the water. 

The men replaced the screen lid. They clamped it shut. 

I stared out at them, realizing in horror that we had no way to escape. 

The water in the tank was about six feet deep. We all kicked and paddled, 
trying to stay above the surface. There was barely enough room for the three of 
us. 

“All right,” said one of the men. “Let’s go.” 

“Wait!” Dr. D. shouted. “You can’t just leave us here!” 

The three men exchanged glances. “You’re right. We can’t,” said one. 

They stepped toward us. 

So they aren’t heartless monsters after all, I thought. They weren’t going to 
leave us. 

But what were they going to do? 

The first man signaled the other two. They raised their hands to one side of 
the tank. 

“One, two, three—” the first man called out. 

On three, they pushed the tank over the side of the deck. 

We were thrown together. Then our bodies slammed against the side of the 
tank as it dropped into the ocean. 

Ocean water seeped into the tank. 



“The tank—it’s sinking!” cried Dr. D. 

We watched the kidnappers’ boat as it roared away. Our tank rocked in its 
wake. Then it started to sink. 

“We’re going under!” Sheena screamed. “We’re going to drown!” 



23 


All three of us desperately pushed against the screen. I beat my fists against it. 
Dr. D. tried to get his shoulder against it. 

But the tank tilted in the water, and we were all tossed back. 

The screen was made of heavy steel mesh, and clamped onto the top of the 
tank. We couldn’t reach the clamps from inside, so we had to try to break 
through it. 

We pushed with all our strength. It wouldn’t budge. 

The tank slowly sank deeper below the surface of the dark, rolling water. 
The moon disappeared behind a blanket of clouds, leaving us in total darkness. 

We had only a minute or two before the tank dropped completely below the 
surface. 

Sheena started to cry. “I’m so afraid!” she shrieked. “I’m so afraid!” 

Dr. D. pounded his fists against the glass tank wall, trying to break through. 

I ran my hands all along the top of the tank, looking for a weak spot in the 
screen. 

Then I hit something. 

A tiny latch. 

“Look!” I cried, pointing to the latch. 

I fumbled with it, trying to open it. “It’s stuck!” 

“Let me try.” Dr. D. tore at the latch with his fingers. “It’s jammed shut,” he 

said. 

Sheena took a red barrette from her hair. “Maybe we can loosen it with 
this,” she said. 

Dr. D. took the barrette and scraped hard around the latch. 

“It’s working!” he said. 

Maybe there’s hope, I thought. Maybe we’ll get out of here! 

Dr. D. stopped scraping and tugged at the latch. 

It moved! 

It opened! 

“We’re free!” cried Sheena. 

We all pushed at the screen. We pushed again. 



“Come on, kids, push harder,” urged Dr. D. 

We pushed again. The screen didn’t move. The latch hadn’t opened it after 
all. Two other latches held the screen in place. 

Two latches we couldn’t reach. 

We all grew silent. The only sounds now were Sheena’s soft, frightened 
sobs and the steady wash of the waves. 

The water had risen nearly to the top of the tank. Soon it would come 
mshing in on us. 

Suddenly, the ocean darkened. The waters grew choppy, and the tank 
rocked a little faster. 

“What’s that noise?” Sheena asked. 

I listened. 

Through the churning of the water, I heard a strange sound. It was very 
faint, as if coming from far away. 

A shrill, high-pitched whistle. 

“It sounds like a siren,” Dr. D. murmured. “Lots of sirens.” 

The eerie wails rose and fell over the water. 

Louder. Closer. 

The sound—as shrill as the screech of metal—surrounded us. 

Suddenly, dark, shadowy forms swirled around the tank. 

We pressed our faces to the glass. 

“That sound. I’ve never heard anything like it. What can it be?” asked Dr. 
D. 

“It—it’s coming from all around!” I stammered. 

The dark water tossed, churned by the shadowy forms. I peered through the 
foam, straining to see. 

Suddenly, out of the murky water, a face appeared. It pressed itself against 
the glass, right in front of my face! 

I gasped and pulled back. 

Then I saw more faces. We were surrounded by small, girlish faces. Their 
wide eyes peered in at us menacingly. 

“Mermaids!” I shrieked. 

“Dozens of them!” Dr. D. murmured in hushed amazement. 

They churned the water with their long tails. 

Their hair, dark tangles in the black water, floated around their faces. The 
tank rocked harder and harder. 



“What do they want?” cried Sheena, her voice shrill and trembling. 

“They look angry,” Dr. D. whispered. 

I stared out at the mermaids, swirling around us like ghosts. They reached 
out their hands and began clutching at the tank. They smacked their tails on the 
water. The dark waters tossed and churned. 

Suddenly I knew. I knew what they wanted. 

“Revenge,” I murmured. “They’ve come for revenge. We took their friend. 
And now they’re going to pay us back.” 



24 


Shadowy hands pressed against the glass. 

“They’re pulling us under!” Dr. D. cried. 

I gasped in terror, staring out at the hands, black outlines against the glass. 
Then, suddenly, the tank began to rise. Up out of the water, higher and 
higher. 

“Huh? What’s happening?” asked Sheena. 

“They—they’re pushing us back up!” I cried happily. 

“The mermaids aren’t taking revenge—they’re saving us!” Dr. D. 
exclaimed. 

The tank brushed up against the Cassandra. I could see the mermaids’ tiny 
hands working above us. 

The clamps popped open. The screen was pulled off. 

With a happy groan, Dr. D. boosted Sheena up. She scrambled on board the 

boat. 

Then I climbed aboard, and we both helped pull Dr. D. out of the tank. 

We were drenched, shivering from the cold. But we were safe. 

The mermaids swarmed around the boat, their pale eyes peering up at us. 
“Thank you,” Dr. D. called down to them. “Thank you for saving our lives.” 
I realized this was the second time a mermaid had saved my life. I owed 
them more than ever now. 

“We’ve got to get the kidnapped mermaid back,” I said. “Who knows what 
Alexander and those creeps will do to her!” 

“Yeah,” cried Sheena. “Look what they tried to do to us!” 

“I wish we could rescue her,” Dr. D. murmured, shaking his head. “But I 
don’t see how we can. How will we find the kidnappers’ boat in the dark? 
They’re long gone by now.” 

But I knew there had to be a way. I leaned over the rail, peering down at the 
mermaids floating beside us, chattering and cooing in the moonlight. 

“Help us!” I pleaded with them. “We want to find your friend. Please—can 
you take us to her?” 

I held my breath and waited. Would the mermaids understand me? Would 



they be able to help us—somehow? 

The mermaids chattered and whistled to one another. Then one of them—a 
dark-haired mermaid with an extra-long tail—moved to the head of the group. 

She began whistling and clicking to the other mermaids. She seemed to be 
giving orders. 

The three of us stared in amazement as the mermaids began to form a long 
line, one mermaid after the other, stretching far out to sea. 

“Do you think they’re going to lead us to the kidnappers?” I asked. 

“Maybe,” Dr. D. replied thoughtfully. “But how will the mermaids find the 
boat?” He rubbed his chin. “I know. I’ll bet they’ll use their sonar. I wish I had 
time to really listen to those sounds they’re making—” 

“Look, Dr. D!” Sheena interrupted. “The mermaids are swimming away!” 

We watched the dark figures slide away through the rolling black waters. 

“Quick!” I cried. “We’ve got to follow them.” 

“Too dangerous,” Dr. D. replied, sighing. “We can’t fight Alexander and 
four big masked men by ourselves!” 

He paced back and forth on the narrow deck. “We should call the island 
police,” he said finally. “But what would we say? That we’re chasing after a 
kidnapped mermaid? No one would believe us.” 

“Dr. D., we have to follow them. Please!” I pleaded. “The mermaids are 
swimming out of sight!” 

He stared at me for a long moment. “Okay. Let’s get going,” he said finally. 

I hurried to the stern to untie the dinghy. Dr. D. dropped it into the water 
and jumped in. Sheena and I followed. Dr. D. started the motor—and we raced 
after the shimmering line of mermaids. 

The mermaids glided so quickly through the rolling waters, it was hard for 
the small boat to keep up with them. 

About fifteen or twenty minutes later, we found ourselves in a small, 
deserted cove. The moon drifted out of the clouds. It cast pale light on a dark 
boat anchored near the shore. 

Dr. D. cut the motor so the kidnappers wouldn’t hear us approaching. 

“They must be asleep,” he whispered. 

“How can Alexander sleep after what he did to us?” said Sheena. “He left 
us to drown!” 

“Money can make people do terrible things,” Dr. D. replied sadly. “But it’s 
good they think we’re dead. They won’t be expecting us.” 



“But where’s the mermaid?” I whispered, staring at the dark boat, bobbing 
gently under the misty moonlight. 

We drifted silently toward the darkened boat. 

Well, we’ve found the kidnappers, I thought, holding on to the side of the 
dinghy as we drew near. 

There’s just one problem. 

What do we do next? 



25 


The air became very still. The kidnappers’ boat sat gently on the calm, glassy 
waters of the cove. 

“What happened to all the mermaids?” Sheena whispered. 

I shrugged. There was no sign of them. I imagined them swimming way 
down below the surface, hiding. 

Suddenly, at the side of the kidnappers’ boat, I saw ripples in the water. 

Slowly, silently, our dinghy glided toward the boat. I stared at the ripples, 
trying to see what was making them. Then I saw a flash of blond hair in the 
moonlight. 

“The mermaid!” I whispered. “There she is!” 

She was floating in the water, tied to the back of the kidnappers’ boat. 

“They must not have a tank to keep her in,” Dr. D. whispered excitedly. 
“Lucky for us.” 

Suddenly, we saw other figures rippling the water. Mermaids arched up, 
circling the captured mermaid. I saw tail fins raised like giant fans. I saw hands 
reach around the mermaid, hands tugging at the rope that held her. 

The waters tossed quietly as the figures worked. 

“The mermaids are setting her free,” I whispered. 

“What are we going to do?” Sheena asked. 

“We’ll just make sure she gets away safely,” Dr. D. replied. “Then we’ll slip 
away. The kidnappers will never know we were here.” 

We watched the mermaids struggle with the rope as our dinghy washed up 
against the kidnappers’ boat. 

“Come on, mermaids!” Sheena urged under her breath. “Hurry!” 

“Maybe they need some help,” I said. 

Dr. D. began to steer toward the mermaids. 

I gasped as a light flared on the kidnappers’ boat. A match set flame to a 
torch. 

An angry voice boomed, “What do you think you’re doing?” 



26 


I ducked away as the flaming torch was thrust in my face. 

Behind the torch, I could see the kidnapper glaring down at me. He had 
quickly pulled on his black mask. It covered only the top of his face. 

I heard a clambering sound, cries of surprise. Alexander and the other three 
kidnappers appeared on the deck. 

“How did you get here?” demanded the man with the torch. “Why aren’t 
you dead?” 

“We’ve come for the mermaid,” Dr. D. called up to him. “You can’t keep 
her here!” 

The torch swung past my head. I stood up in the dinghy and took a swipe at 
it, trying to knock it into the water. 

“Billy, no!” cried Dr. D. 

The kidnapper pulled the torch away. I fell forward in the dinghy, toppling 
over on Sheena. 

“Give us back the mermaid!” Dr. D. demanded. 

“Finders, keepers,” the kidnapper muttered. “You’ve made a long trip for 
nothing. And now look—your boat is on fire.” 

He lowered the torch to the dinghy and set it aflame. 



27 


The flames flared up, bright orange and yellow against the blue-black sky. They 
spread quickly across the front of the dinghy. 

Sheena uttered a terrified scream and tried to back away from the flames. 

In a panic, she started to leap into the water—but Dr. D. pulled her back. 
“Don’t leave the boat! You’ll drown!” 

The fire crackled. The bright flames shot higher. 

Dr. D. grabbed a yellow life jacket from the bottom of the dinghy and 
started frantically beating out the fire. 

“Billy—get a life jacket!” he yelled. “Sheena—find the bucket. Throw 
water on the flames—hurry!” 

I found a life jacket and beat at the flames. Sheena dumped seawater on 
them as fast as she could. 

Over the crackling flames, I heard Alexander shout, “Get the mermaid 
aboard. Let’s get out of here!” 

“Dr. D.!” I cried. “They’re getting away!” 

Then I heard the kidnappers yelling. “The mermaid! Where’s the 
mermaid?” 

I turned to the side of the boat. The mermaid was gone. Her friends had 
freed her. 

One of the kidnappers reached down from his boat and grabbed me. “What 
did you do with the mermaid?” he demanded. 

“Let him go!” shouted Dr. D. 

I tried to squirm away from the kidnapper. He held me tight. Then I saw 
another kidnapper swing a club at Dr. D.’s head. 

Dr. D. dodged the club. The kidnapper tried to hit him in the stomach. Dr. 
D. dodged again. 

I kicked and squirmed. Sheena tugged at the kidnapper’s hands, trying to 
help me escape. 

The third kidnapper picked her up by the wrists and threw her to the floor 
of the dinghy. 

“Let go of the kids!” pleaded Dr. D. “Alexander! Help us!” 

Alexander didn’t move from his spot on the deck. He stood with his brawny 



arms crossed in front of him, calmly watching the fight. 

The flames had nearly been quenched, but they suddenly flared up again. 

“Sheena—the fire!” I cried. “Put out the fire!” 

She grabbed the bucket and poured seawater everywhere. 

One of the kidnappers kicked the bucket from her hands. It landed in the 
water with a splash. 

Sheena picked up a life jacket and beat the last of the flames out. 

“Drop down into their boat and toss them in the water!” I heard a kidnapper 
shout up above. 

A man started to lower himself to our dinghy. But suddenly he lurched 
forward, his arms flailing. He let out a cry of surprise as his boat began to rock 
violently to the left. It looked as if it had been slammed by a huge wave. 

The kidnappers cried out as their boat began to rock back and forth. Slowly 
at first. Then violently. Gripping the sides of the dinghy, I watched them clinging 
to the rail, screaming in confusion and surprise. 

Dr. D. slowly stood up, trying to see what was happening. 

The boat tossed violently, as if bucking tall waves. 

The mermaids. I could see them now. 

They had surrounded the kidnappers’ ship and were rocking it hard. 

Hard. Harder. The kidnappers hung on helplessly. 

“Mission accomplished!” Dr. D. cried happily. He started up the motor and 
we roared off. 

Turning back, I could see the boat tilting and rocking in the water. And I 
could see our mermaid swimming free, behind the other mermaids in the 
shimmering waves. 

“She got away!” I cried. “She’s free!” 

“I hope she’ll be all right,” said Sheena. 

“We’ll look for her tomorrow,” said Dr. D. as he steered us back to the sea 
lab. “We know where to find her now.” 

Sheena glanced at me. I glanced back. 

Oh, no, I thought. After all this, it can’t be true. 

Is Dr. D. going to catch the mermaid again—and give her to the zoo? 

Sheena and I met in the galley the next morning. Since Alexander was gone, we 
had to fix our own breakfasts. 

“Do you think the mermaid went back to the lagoon?” asked Sheena. 



“Probably,” I replied. “That’s where she lives.” 

She spooned some cereal into her mouth and chewed with a thoughtful look 
on her face. 

“Sheena,” I said, “if someone gave you a million dollars, would you show 
them where the mermaid lives?” 

“No,” Sheena replied. “Not if they wanted to capture her.” 

“Me, neither,” I said. “That’s what I don’t get. Dr. D. is a great guy. I just 
can’t believe he’d—” 

I stopped. I heard a noise. The sound of a motor. 

Sheena listened. She heard it, too. 

We dropped our spoons and ran up on deck. 

Dr. D. was standing on the deck, staring out to sea. 

A boat was approaching. A white boat with Marina Zoo stenciled on the 
side in large letters. 

“The zoo people!” I said to Sheena. “They’re here!” 

What would our uncle do? I wondered with growing dread. Would he tell 
them where the mermaid was? Would he accept the million dollars? 

Sheena and I ducked behind the cockpit. We watched the Marina Zoo boat 
tie up beside the Cassandra. I recognized Mr. Showalter and Ms. Wickman. 

Mr. Showalter tossed a rope to Dr. D. Ms. Wickman jumped aboard. 

The zoo people smiled and shook Dr. D.’s hand. He nodded at them 
solemnly. 

“We had word from the fishermen on Santa Anita that you found the 
mermaid,” Mr. Showalter said. “We’re ready to take her with us now.” 

Ms. Wickman opened her briefcase and pulled out a slender envelope. 
“Here is a check for one million dollars, Dr. Deep,” she said, smiling. “We’ve 
made it out to you and the Cassandra Research Lab.” 

She held out the check to my uncle. 

I peered out from behind the cockpit. Please don’t take it, Dr. D., I pleaded 
silently. Please don’t take the check. 

“Thank you very much,” my uncle said. He reached out a hand and took the 
check from her. 



28 


“A million dollars means a great deal to me and my work,” Dr. D. said. “Your 
zoo has been very generous. That’s why I’m sorry I have to do this.” 

He raised the envelope and tore it in half. 

The two zoo people gasped in surprise. 

“I can’t take the money,” Dr. D. said. 

“Just what are you saying, Dr. Deep?” Mr. Showalter demanded. 

“You sent me on a wild goose chase,” my uncle replied. “I have searched 
these waters thoroughly ever since you left. With my equipment, I searched 
every inch of the lagoon and all the surrounding waters. I am now more 
convinced than ever before that mermaids do not exist.” 

“Yaaaay!” I screamed to myself. I wanted to jump up and down and cheer 
my head off—but I stayed hidden with Sheena behind the cockpit. 

“But what about the fishermen’s stories?” Ms. Wickman protested. 

“The local fishermen have told mermaid stories for years,” Dr. D. told her. 
“I think they believe they’ve really seen mermaids rising through the mist on 
foggy days. But what they have seen are only fish, or dolphins, or manatees, or 
even swimmers. Because mermaids don’t exist. They’re fantasy creatures.” 

Mr. Showalter and Ms. Wickman both sighed in disappointment. 

“Are you sure about this?” Mr. Showalter asked. 

“Completely sure,” my uncle replied firmly. “My equipment is very 
sensitive. It can pick up the tiniest minnow.” 

“We respect your opinion, Dr. Deep,” Mr. Showalter said with some 
sadness. “You’re the leading expert on exotic sea creatures. That’s why we came 
to you in the first place.” 

“Thank you,” said Dr. D. “Then I hope you’ll take my advice and drop your 
hunt for a mermaid.” 

“I guess we’ll have to,” said Ms. Wickman. “Thank you for trying, Dr. 
Deep.” 

They all shook hands. Then the zoo people got back on their boat and 
motored away. 

The coast was clear. Sheena and I came bursting out of our hiding place. 

“Dr. D.!” cried Sheena, throwing her arms around him. “You’re the 



greatest!” 

A wide grin spread over Dr. D.’s face. “Thanks, guys,” he said. “From now 
on, none of us will say anything to anyone about mermaids. Is it a deal?” 

“It’s a deal,” Sheena instantly agreed. 

“Deal,” I said. We all shook hands. The mermaid was our secret. 

I swore I’d never mention the mermaid to anyone. But I wanted to see her one 
last time. I wanted to say good-bye. 

After lunch, Sheena and Dr. D. went to their cabins to nap. We had been up 
for most of the night, after all. I pretended to take a nap, too. 

But once they were asleep, I sneaked out of my cabin and slipped into the 
bright blue water. 

I swam over to the lagoon to search for the mermaid. 

The sun was high in a pale blue sky. It glowed down on the still lagoon 
waters, making them glitter as if covered in gold. 

Mermaid? Where are you? I wondered. 

I was just past the reef when I felt a playful tug on my leg. 

Sheena? I thought. Had she followed me again ? 

I spun around to catch her. 

No one there. 

Seaweed, probably, I thought. I kept swimming. 

A few seconds later, I felt the tug again. Harder this time. 

Hey—it must be the mermaid! I told myself. 

I turned once again to search for her. 

The water rippled. “Mermaid?” I called. A head popped out of the water. A 
gigantic, slimy, dark green head. With one enormous eye. And a mouthful of 
jagged teeth. “The sea monster!” I shrieked. “The sea monster!” Would they 
believe me this time? 




THE SCARECROW 
WALKS AT MIDNIGHT 
Goosebumps - 20 
R.L. Stine 


1 


“Hey, Jodie—wait up!” 

I turned and squinted into the bright sunlight. My brother, Mark, was still 
on the concrete train platform. The train had clattered off. I could see it snaking 
its way through the low, green meadows in the distance. 

I turned to Stanley. Stanley is the hired man on my grandparents’ farm. He 
stood beside me, carrying both suitcases. “Look in the dictionary for the word 
‘slowpoke’,” I said, “and you’ll see Mark’s picture.” 

Stanley smiled at me. “I like the dictionary, Jodie,” he said. “Sometimes I 
read it for hours.” 

“Hey, Mark—get a move on!” I cried. But he was taking his good time, 
walking slowly, in a daze as usual. 

I tossed my blond hair behind my shoulders and turned back to Stanley. 
Mark and I hadn’t visited the farm for a year. But Stanley still looked the same. 

He’s so skinny. “Like a noodle”, my grandma always says. His denim 
overalls always look five sizes too big on him. 

Stanley is about forty or forty-five, I think. He wears his dark hair in a 
crewcut, shaved close to his head. His ears are huge. They stick way out and are 
always bright red. And he has big, round, brown eyes that remind me of puppy 
eyes. 

Stanley isn’t very smart. Grandpa Kurt always says that Stanley isn’t 
working with a full one hundred watts. 

But Mark and I really like him. He has a quiet sense of humor. And he is 
kind and gentle and friendly, and always has lots of amazing things to show us 
whenever we visit the farm. 

“You look nice, Jodie,” Stanley said, his cheeks turning as red as his ears. 
“How old are you now?” 

“Twelve,” I told him. “And Mark is eleven.” 

He thought about it. “That makes twenty-three,” he joked. 

We both laughed. You never know what Stanley is going to say! 

“I think I stepped in something gross,” Mark complained, catching up to us. 

I always know what Mark is going to say. My brother only knows three 
words— cool, weird, and gross. Really. That’s his whole vocabulary. 



As a joke, I gave him a dictionary for his last birthday. “You’re weird,” 
Mark said when I handed it to him. “What a gross gift.” 

He scraped his white high-tops on the ground as we followed Stanley to the 
beat-up, red pickup truck. “Carry my backpack for me,” Mark said, trying to 
shove the bulging backpack at me. 

“No way,” I told him. “Carry it yourself.” 

The backpack contained his Walkman, about thirty tapes, comic books, his 
Game Boy, and at least fifty game cartridges. I knew he planned to spend the 
whole month lying on the hammock on the screened-in back porch of the 
farmhouse, listening to music and playing video games. 

Well... no way! 

Mom and Dad said it was my job to make sure Mark got outside and 
enjoyed the farm. We were so cooped up in the city all year. That’s why they 
sent us to visit Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam for a month each summer— 
to enjoy the great outdoors. 

We stopped beside the truck while Stanley searched his overall pockets for 
the key. “It’s going to get pretty hot today,” Stanley said, “unless it cools down.” 

A typical Stanley weather report. 

I gazed out at the wide, grassy field beyond the small train station parking 
lot. Thousands of tiny white puffballs floated up against the clear blue sky. 

It was so beautiful! 

Naturally, I sneezed. 

I love visiting my grandparents’ farm. My only problem is, I’m allergic to 
just about everything on it. 

So Mom packs several bottles of my allergy medicine for me—and lots of 
tissues. 

“Gesundheit, ” Stanley said. He tossed our two suitcases in the back of the 
pickup. Mark slid his backpack in, too. “Can I ride in back?” he asked. 

He loves to lie flat in the back, staring up at the sky, and bumping up and 
down really hard. 

Stanley is a terrible driver. He can’t seem to concentrate on steering and 
driving at the right speed at the same time. So there are always lots of quick 
turns and heavy bumps. 

Mark lifted himself into the back of the pickup and stretched out next to the 
suitcases. I climbed beside Stanley in the front. 

A short while later, we were bouncing along the narrow, twisting road that 



led to the farm. I stared out the dusty window at the passing meadows and 
farmhouses. Everything looked so green and alive. 

Stanley drove with both hands wrapped tightly around the top of the 
steering wheel. He sat forward stiffly, leaning over the wheel, staring straight 
ahead through the windshield without blinking. 

“Mr. Mortimer doesn’t farm his place anymore,” he said, lifting one hand 
from the wheel to point to a big, white farmhouse on top of a sloping, green hill. 

“Why not?” I asked. 

“Because he died,” Stanley replied solemnly. 

See what I mean? You never know what Stanley is going to say. 

We bounced over a deep rut in the road. I was sure Mark was having a great 
time in back. 

The road leads through the small town, so small that it doesn’t even have a 
name. The farmers have always called it Town. 

It has a feed store, a combination gas station and grocery store, a white- 
steepled church, a hardware store, and a mailbox. 

There were two trucks parked in front of the feed store. I didn’t see anyone 
as we barreled past. 

My grandparents’ farm is about two miles from town. I recognized the 
cornfields as we approached. 

“The corn is so high already!” I exclaimed, staring through the bouncing 
window. “Have you eaten any yet?” 

“Just at dinner,” Stanley replied. 

Suddenly, he slowed the truck and turned his eyes to me. “The scarecrow 
walks at midnight,” he uttered in a low voice. 

“Huh?” I wasn’t sure I’d heard correctly. 

“The scarecrow walks at midnight,” he repeated, training his big puppy 
eyes on me. “I read it in the book.” 

I didn’t know what to say, so I laughed. I thought maybe he was making a 

joke. 


Days later, I realized it was no joke. 



2 


Watching the farm spread out in front of us filled me with happiness. It’s not a 
big farm or a fancy farm, but I like everything about it. 

I like the barn with its sweet smells. I like the low mooing sounds of the 
cows way off in the far pasture. I like to watch the tall stalks of corn, all swaying 
together in the wind. 

Corny, huh? 

I also like the scary ghost stories Grandpa Kurt tells us at night in front of 
the fireplace. 

And I have to include Grandma Miriam’s chocolate chip pancakes. They’re 
so good, I sometimes dream about them back home in the city. 

I also like the happy expressions on my grandparents’ faces when we come 
mshing up to greet them. 

Of course I was the first one out of the truck. Mark was as slow as usual. I 
went running up to the screen porch in back of their big, old farmhouse. I 
couldn’t wait to see my grandparents. 

Grandma Miriam came waddling out, her arms outstretched. The screen 
door slammed behind her. But then I saw Grandpa Kurt push it open and he 
hurried out, too. 

His limp was worse, I noticed right away. He leaned heavily on a white 
cane. He’d never needed one before. 

I didn’t have time to think about it as Mark and I were smothered in hugs. 
“So good to see you! It’s been so long, so long!” Grandma Miriam cried happily. 

There were the usual comments about how much taller we were and how 
grown up we looked. 

“Jodie, where’d you get that blond hair? There aren’t any blonds in my 
family,” Grandpa Kurt would say, shaking his mane of white hair. “You must get 
that from your father’s side. 

“No, I know. I bet you got it from a store,” he said, grinning. It was his little 
joke. He greeted me with it every summer. And his blue eyes would sparkle 
excitedly. 

“You’re right. It’s a wig,” I told him, laughing. 

He gave my long blond hair a playful tug. 



“Did you get cable yet?” Mark asked, dragging his backpack along the 
ground. 

“Cable TV?” Grandpa Kurt stared hard at Mark. “Not yet. But we still get 
three channels. How many more do we need?” 

Mark rolled his eyes. “No MTV,” he groaned. 

Stanley made his way past us, carrying our suitcases into the house. 

“Let’s go in. I’ll bet you’re starving,” Grandma Miriam said. “I made soup 
and sandwiches. We’ll have chicken and corn tonight. The corn is very sweet 
this year. I know how you two love it.” 

I watched my grandparents as they led the way to the house. They both 
looked older to me. They moved more slowly than I remembered. Grandpa 
Kurt’s limp was definitely worse. They both seemed tired. 

Grandma Miriam is short and chubby. She has a round face surrounded by 
curly red hair. Bright red. There’s no way to describe the color. I don’t know 
what she uses to dye it that color. I’ve never seen it on anyone else! 

She wears square-shaped eyeglasses that give her a really old-fashioned 
look. She likes big, roomy housedresses. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her in jeans 
or pants. 

Grandpa Kurt is tall and broad-shouldered. Mom says he was really 
handsome when he was young. “Like a movie star,” she always tells me. 

Now he has wavy, white hair, still very thick, that he wets and slicks down 
flat on his head. He has sparkling blue eyes that always make me smile. And a 
white stubble over his slender face. Grandpa Kurt doesn’t like to shave. 

Today he was wearing a long-sleeved, red-and-green-plaid shirt, buttoned to 
the collar despite the hot day, and baggy jeans, stained at one knee, held up by 
white suspenders. 

Lunch was fun. We sat around the long kitchen table. Sunlight poured in 
through the big window. I could see the barn in back and the cornfields 
stretching behind it. 

Mark and I told all our news—about school, about my basketball team 
going to the championships, about our new car, about Dad growing a mustache. 

For some reason, Stanley thought that was very funny. He was laughing so 
hard, he choked on his split-pea soup. And Grandpa Kurt had to reach over and 
slap him on the back. 

It’s hard to know what will crack Stanley up. As Mark would say, Stanley is 
definitely weird. 



All through lunch, I kept staring at my grandparents. I couldn’t get over 
how much they had changed in one year. They seemed so much quieter, so much 
slower. 

That’s what it means to get older, I told myself. 

“Stanley will have to show you his scarecrows,” Grandma Miriam said, 
passing the bowl of potato chips. “Won’t you, Stanley?” 

Grandpa Kurt cleared his throat loudly. I had the feeling he was telling 
Grandma Miriam to change the subject or something. 

“I made them,” Stanley said, grinning proudly. He turned his big eyes on 
me. “The book—it told me how.” 

“Are you still taking guitar lessons?” Grandpa Kurt asked Mark. 

I could see that, for some reason, Grandpa Kurt didn’t want to talk about 
Stanley’s scarecrows. 

“Yeah,” Mark answered with a mouthful of potato chips. “But I sold my 
acoustic. I switched to electric.” 

“You mean you have to plug it in?” Stanley asked. He started to giggle, as if 
he had just cracked a funny joke. 

“What a shame you didn’t bring your guitar,” Grandma Miriam said to 
Mark. 

“No, it isn’t,” I teased. “The cows would start giving sour milk!” 

“Shut up, Jodie!” Mark snapped. He has no sense of humor. 

“They already do give sour milk,” Grandpa Kurt muttered, lowering his 

eyes. 

“Bad luck. When cows give sour milk, it means bad luck,” Stanley 
declared, his eyes widening, his expression suddenly fearful. 

“It’s okay, Stanley,” Grandma Miriam assured him quickly, placing a hand 
gently on his shoulder. “Grandpa Kurt was only teasing.” 

“If you kids are finished, why not go with Stanley,” Grandpa Kurt said. 
“He’ll give you a tour of the farm. You always enjoy that.” He sighed. “I’d go 
along, but my leg—it’s been acting up again.” 

Grandma Miriam started to clear the dishes. Mark and I followed Stanley 
out the back door. The grass in the back yard had recently been mowed. The air 
was heavy with its sweet smell. 

I saw a hummingbird fluttering over the flower garden beside the house. I 
pointed it out to Mark, but by the time he turned, it had hummed away. 

At the back of the long, green yard stood the old barn. Its white walls were 



badly stained and peeling. It really needed a paint job. The doors were open, and 
I could see square bales of straw inside. 

Far to the right of the barn, almost to the cornfields, stood the small guest 
house where Stanley lived with his teenage son, Sticks. 

“Stanley—where’s Sticks?” I asked. “Why wasn’t he at lunch?” 

“Went to town,” Stanley answered quietly. “Went to town, riding on a 
pony.” 

Mark and I exchanged glances. We never can figure Stanley out. 

Poking up from the cornfield stood several dark figures, the scarecrows 
Grandma Miriam had started to talk about. I stared out at them, shielding my 
eyes from the sun with one hand. 

“So many scarecrows!” I exclaimed. “Stanley, last summer there was only 
one. Why are there so many now?” 

He didn’t reply. He didn’t seem to hear me. He had a black baseball cap 
pulled down low over his forehead. He was taking long strides, leaning forward 
with that storklike walk of his, his hands shoved into the pockets of his baggy 
denim overalls. 

“We’ve seen the farm a hundred times,” Mark complained, whispering to 
me. “Why do we have to take the grand tour again?” 

“Mark—cool your jets,” I told him. “We always take a tour of the farm. It’s 
a tradition.” 

Mark grumbled to himself. He really is lazy. He never wants to do anything. 

Stanley led the way past the barn into the cornfields. The stalks were way 
over my head. Their golden tassels gleamed in the bright sunlight. 

Stanley reached up and pulled an ear off the stalk. “Let’s see if it’s ready,” 
he said, grinning at Mark and me. 

He held the ear in his left hand and started to shuck it with his right. 

After a few seconds, he pulled the husk away, revealing the ear of corn 
inside. 

I stared at it—and let out a horrified cry. 



3 


“Ohhhh—it’s disgusting !” I shrieked. 

“Gross!” I heard Mark groan. 

The corn was a disgusting brown color. And it was moving on the cob. 
Wriggling. Squirming. 

Stanley raised the corn to his face to examine it. And I realized it was 
covered with worms. Hundreds of wriggling, brown worms. 

“No!” Stanley cried in horror. He let the ear of corn drop to the ground at 
his feet. “That’s bad luck! The book says so. That’s very bad luck!” 

I stared down at the ear of corn. The worms were wriggling off the cob, 
onto the dirt. 

“It’s okay, Stanley,” I told him. “I only screamed because I was surprised. 
This happens sometimes. Sometimes worms get into the corn. Grandpa told me.” 

“No. It’s bad,” Stanley insisted in a trembling voice. His red ears were 
aflame. His big eyes revealed his fear. “The book—it says so.” 

“What book?” Mark demanded. He kicked the wormy ear of corn away 
with the toe of his high-top. 

“My book,” Stanley replied mysteriously. “My superstition book.” 

Uh-oh, I thought. Stanley shouldn’t have a book about superstitions. He 
was already the most superstitious person in the world—even without a book! 

“You’ve been reading a book about superstitions?” Mark asked him, 
watching the brown worms crawl over the soft dirt. 

“Yes.” Stanley nodded his head enthusiastically. “It’s a good book. It tells 
me everything. And it’s all true. All of it!” 

He pulled off his cap and scratched his stubby hair. “I’ve got to check the 
book. I’ve got to see what to do about the corn. The bad corn.” 

He was getting pretty worked up. It was making me feel a little scared. I’ve 
known Stanley my whole life. I think he’s worked for Grandpa Kurt for more 
than twenty years. 

He’s always been strange. But I’ve never seen him get so upset about 
something as unimportant as a bad ear of corn. 

“Show us the scarecrows,” I said, trying to get his mind off the corn. 

“Yeah. Let’s see them,” Mark joined in. 



“Okay. The scarecrows.” Stanley nodded. Then he turned, still thinking 
hard, and began leading the way through the tall rows of cornstalks. 

The stalks creaked and groaned as we passed by them. It was kind of an 
eerie sound. 

Suddenly, a shadow fell over me. One of the dark scarecrows rose up in 
front of us. It wore a tattered black coat, stuffed with straw. Its arms stretched 
stiffly out at its sides. 

The scarecrow was tall, towering over my head. Tall enough to stand over 
the high cornstalks. 

Its head was a faded burlap bag, filled with straw. Evil black eyes and a 
menacing frown had been painted on thickly in black paint. A battered old- 
fashioned hat rested on its head. 

“You made these?” I asked Stanley. I could see several other scarecrows 
poking up from the corn. They all stood in the same stiff position. They all had 
the same menacing frown. 

He stared up the scarecrow’s face. “I made them,” he said in a low voice. 
“The book showed me how.” 

“They’re pretty scary looking,” Mark said, standing close beside me. He 
grabbed the scarecrow’s straw hand and shook it. “What’s up?” Mark asked it. 

“The scarecrow walks at midnight,” Stanley said, repeating the phrase he 
had used at the train station. 

Mark was trying to slap the scarecrow a high-five. 

“What does that mean?” I asked Stanley. 

“The book told me how,” Stanley replied, keeping his eyes on the dark- 
painted face on the burlap bag. “The book told me how to make them walk.” 

“Huh? You mean you make the scarecrows walk?” I asked, very confused. 

Stanley’s dark eyes locked on mine. Once again, he got that very solemn 
expression on his face. “I know how to do it. The book has all the words.” 

I stared back at him, totally confused. I didn’t know what to say. 

“I made them walk, Jodie,” Stanley continued in a voice just above a 
whisper. “I made them walk last week. And now I’m the boss.” 

“Huh? The boss of the s-scarecrows?” I stammered. “Do you mean—” 

I stopped when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the scarecrow’s arm 
move. 

The straw crinkled as the arm slid up. 

Then I felt rough straw brush against my face—as the dry scarecrow arm 



moved to my throat. 



4 


The prickly straw, poking out of the sleeve of the black coat, scraped against my 
neck. 

I let out a shrill scream. 

“It’s alivel” I cried in panic, diving to the ground, scrambling away on all 
fours. 

I turned back to see Mark and Stanley calmly watching me. 

Hadn’t they seen the scarecrow try to choke me? 

Then Stanley’s son, Sticks, stepped out from behind the scarecrow, a gleeful 
grin on his face. 

“Sticks—! You creep!” I cried angrily. I knew at once that he had moved 
the scarecrow’s arm. 

“You city kids sure scare easy,” Sticks said, his grin growing wider. He 
reached down to help me to my feet. “You really thought the scarecrow moved, 
didn’t you, Jodie?” he said accusingly. 

“I can make the scarecrows move,” Stanley said, pulling the cap down 
lower on his forehead. 

“I can make them walk. I did it. It’s all in the book.” 

Sticks’ smile faded. The light seemed to dim from his dark eyes. “Yeah, 
sure, Dad,” he murmured. 

Sticks is sixteen. He is tall and lanky. He has long, skinny arms and legs. 
That’s how he got the nickname Sticks. 

He tries to look tough. He has long black hair down past his collar, which 
he seldom washes. He wears tight muscle shirts and dirty jeans, ripped at the 
knees. He sneers a lot, and his dark eyes always seem to be laughing at you. 

He calls Mark and me “the city kids”. He always says it with a sneer. And 
he’s always playing stupid jokes on us. I think he’s kind of jealous of Mark and 
me. I don’t think it’s been easy for Sticks to grow up on the farm, living in the 
little guest house with his dad. 

I mean, Stanley is more like a kid than a father. 

“I saw you back there,” Mark told Sticks. 

“Well, thanks for warning me!” I snapped at Mark. I turned back angrily to 
Sticks. “I see you haven’t changed at all.” 



“Great to see you, too, Jodie,” he replied sarcastically. “The city kids are 
back for another month with the hicks!” 

“Sticks—what’s your problem?” I shot back. 

“Be nice,” Stanley muttered. “The corn has ears, you know.” 

We all stared at Stanley. Had he just made a joke? It was hard to tell with 

him. 

Stanley’s face remained serious. His big eyes stared out at me through the 
shade of his cap. “The corn has ears,” he repeated. “There are spirits in the 
field.” 

Sticks shook his head unhappily. “Dad, you spend too much time with that 
superstition book,” he muttered. 

“The book is all true,” Stanley replied. “It’s all true.” 

Sticks kicked at the dirt. He raised his eyes to me. His expression seemed 
very sad. “Things are different here,” he murmured. 

“Huh?” I didn’t understand. “What do you mean?” 

Sticks turned to his father. Stanley was staring back at him, his eyes 
narrowed. 

Sticks shrugged and didn’t reply. He grabbed Mark’s arm and squeezed it. 
“You’re as flabby as ever,” he told Mark. “Want to throw a football around this 
afternoon?” 

“It’s kind of hot,” Mark replied. He wiped the sweat off his forehead with 
the back of his hand. 

Sticks sneered at him. “Still a wimp, huh?” 

“No way!” Mark protested. “I just said it was hot, that’s all.” 

“Hey—you’ve got something on your back,” Sticks told Mark. “Turn 
around.” 

Mark obediently turned around. 

Sticks quickly bent down, picked up the wormy corncob, and stuffed it 
down the back of Mark’s T-shirt. 

I had to laugh as I watched my brother run screaming all the way back to 
the farmhouse. 

Dinner was quiet. Grandma Miriam’s fried chicken was as tasty as ever. And she 
was right about the corn. It was very sweet. Mark and I each ate two ears, 
dripping with butter. 

I enjoyed the dinner. But it upset me that both of my grandparents seemed 



so changed. Grandpa Kurt used to talk nonstop. He always had dozens of funny 
stories about the farmers in the area. And he always had new jokes to tell. 

Tonight he barely said a word. 

Grandma Miriam kept urging Mark and me to eat more. And she kept 
asking us how we liked everything. But she, too, seemed quieter. 

They both seemed tense. Uncomfortable. 

They both kept glancing down the table at Stanley, who was eating with 
both hands, butter dripping down his chin. 

Sticks sat glumly across from his father. He seemed even more unfriendly 
than usual. 

Stanley was the only cheerful person at the table. He chewed his chicken 
enthusiastically and asked for a third helping of mashed potatoes. 

“Is everything okay, Stanley?” Grandma Miriam kept asking, biting her 
bottom lip. “Everything okay?” 

Stanley burped and smiled. “Not bad,” was his reply. 

Why do things seem so different? I wondered. Is it just because Grandma 
and Grandpa are getting old? 

After dinner, we sat around the big, comfortable living room. Grandpa Kurt 
rocked gently back and forth in the antique wooden rocking chair by the 
fireplace. 

It was too hot to build a fire. But as he rocked, he stared into the dark 
fireplace, a thoughtful expression on his white-stubbled face. 

Grandma Miriam sat in her favorite chair, a big, green overstuffed armchair 
across from Grandpa Kurt. She had an unopened gardening magazine in her lap. 

Sticks, who had barely said two words the whole evening, disappeared. 
Stanley leaned against the wall, poking his teeth with a toothpick. 

Mark sank down into the long, green couch. I sat down at the other end of it 
and stared across the room. 

“Yuck. That stuffed bear still gives me the creeps!” I exclaimed. 

At the far end of the room, an enormous stuffed brown bear—about eight 
feet tall—stood straight up on its hind legs. Grandpa Kurt had shot it many years 
ago on a hunting trip. The bear’s huge paws were extended, as if ready to 
pounce. 

“That was a killer bear,” Grandpa Kurt remembered, rocking slowly, his 
eyes on the angry-looking beast. “He mauled two hunters before I shot him. I 
saved their lives.” 



I shuddered and turned away from the bear. I really hated it. I don’t know 
why Grandma Miriam let Grandpa Kurt keep it in the living room! 

“How about a scary story?” I asked Grandpa Kurt. 

He stared back at me, his blue eyes suddenly lifeless and dull. 

“Yeah. We’ve been looking forward to your stories,” Mark chimed in. “Tell 
us the one about the headless boy in the closet.” 

“No. Tell a new one,” I insisted eagerly. 

Grandpa Kurt rubbed his chin slowly. His eyes went to Stanley across the 
room. Then he cleared his throat nervously. 

“I’m kind of tired, kids,” he said softly. “Think I’ll just go to bed.” 

“But—no story?” I protested. 

He stared back at me with those dull eyes. “I don’t really know any stories,” 
he murmured. He slowly climbed to his feet and headed toward his room. 

What is going on here? I asked myself. What is wrong? 



5 


Upstairs in my bedroom later that night, I changed into a long nightshirt. The 
bedroom window was open, and a soft breeze invaded the room. 

I stared out the open window. A broad apple tree cast its shadow over the 
lawn. 

Where the grass ended, the cornfields stretched out under the glow of the 
full moon. The pale moonlight made the tall stalks shimmer like gold. The stalks 
cast long blue shadows over the field. 

Across the wide field, the scarecrows poked up stiffly like dark-uniformed 
soldiers. Their coat sleeves ruffled in the light breeze. Their pale burlap faces 
seemed to stare back at me. 

I felt a cold chill run down my back. 

So many scarecrows. At least a dozen of them, standing in straight rows. 
Like an army ready to march. 

“The scarecrow walks at midnight.” 

That’s what Stanley had said in that low, frightening tone I had never heard 
him use before. 

I glanced at the clock on the bed table. Just past ten o’clock. 

I’ll be asleep by the time they walk, I thought. 

A crazy thought. 

I sneezed. It seems I’m allergic to the farm air both day and night! 

I stared at the long shadows cast by the scarecrows. A gust of wind bent the 
stalks, making the shadows roll forward like a dark ocean wave. 

And then I saw the scarecrows start to twitch. 

“Mark!” I screamed. “Mark—come here! Hurry!” 



6 


Under the light of the full moon, I stared in horror as the dark scarecrows started 
to move. 

Their arms jerked. Their burlap heads lurched forward. 

All of them. In unison. 

All of the scarecrows were jerking, twitching, straining—as if struggling to 
pull free of their stakes. 

“Mark—hurry!” I screamed. 

I heard footsteps clomping rapidly down the hall. Mark burst breathlessly 
into my room. “Jodie—what is it?” he cried. 

I motioned frantically for him to come to the window. As he stepped beside 
me, I pointed to the cornfields. “Look—the scarecrows.” 

He gripped the windowsill and leaned out the window. 

Over his shoulder, I could see the scarecrows twitch in unison. A cold 
shudder made me wrap my arms around myself. 

“It’s the wind,” Mark said, stepping back from the window. “What’s your 
problem, Jodie? It’s just the wind blowing them around.” 

“You—you’re wrong, Mark,” I stammered, still hugging myself. “Look 
again.” 

He rolled his eyes and sighed. But he turned back and leaned out the 
window. He gazed out at the field for a long time. 

“Don’t you see?” I demanded shrilly. “They’re all moving together. Their 
arms, their heads—all moving together.” 

When Mark pulled back from the window, his blue eyes were wide and 
fearful. He stared at me thoughtfully and didn’t say a word. 

Finally, he swallowed hard and his voice came out low and frightened. 
“We’ve got to tell Grandpa Kurt,” he said. 

We rushed downstairs, but our grandparents had gone to bed. The bedroom door 
was closed. It was silent on the other side. 

“Maybe we’d better wait till tomorrow morning,” I whispered as Mark and 
I tiptoed back upstairs to our rooms. “I think we’ll be safe till then.” 

We crept back to our rooms. I pushed the window shut and locked it. Out in 



the fields, the scarecrows were still twitching, still pulling at their stakes. 

With a shudder, I turned away from the window and plunged into the bed, 
pulling the old quilt up over my head. 

I slept restlessly, tossing under the heavy quilt. In the morning, I jumped 
eagerly from bed. I ran a brush through my hair and hurried down to breakfast. 

Mark was right behind me on the stairs. He was wearing the same jeans as 
yesterday and a red-and-black Nirvana T-shirt. He hadn’t bothered to brush his 
hair. It stood straight up in back. 

“Pancakes!” he managed to choke out. Mark is only good for one word at a 
time this early in the morning. 

But the word instantly cheered me up and made me forget for a moment 
about the creepy scarecrows. 

How could I have forgotten about Grandma Miriam’s amazing chocolate 
chip pancakes? 

They are so soft, they really do melt in your mouth. And the warm 
chocolate mixed with the sweet maple syrup makes the most delicious breakfast 
I’ve ever eaten. 

As we hurried across the living room toward the kitchen, I sniffed the air, 
hoping to smell that wonderful aroma of pancake batter on the stove. 

But my nose was too stuffed up to smell anything. 

Mark and I burst into the kitchen at the same time. Grandpa Kurt and 
Stanley were already at the table. A big blue pot of coffee stood steaming in 
front of them. 

Stanley sipped his coffee. Grandpa Kurt had his face buried behind the 
morning newspaper. He glanced up and smiled as Mark and I entered. 

Everyone said good morning to everyone. 

Mark and I took our places at the table. We were so eager for the famous 
pancakes, we were practically rubbing our hands together the way cartoon 
characters do. 

Imagine our shock when Grandma Miriam set down big bowls of 
cornflakes in front of us. 

I practically burst into tears. 

I glanced across the table at Mark. He was staring back at me, his face 
revealing his surprise—and disappointment. “Cornflakes?” he asked in a high- 
pitched voice. 

Grandma Miriam had gone back to the sink. I turned to her. “Grandma 



Miriam—no pancakes?” I asked meekly. 

I saw her glance at Stanley. “I’ve stopped making them, Jodie,” she replied, 
her eyes still on Stanley. “Pancakes are too fattening.” 

“Nothing like a good bowl of cornflakes in the morning,” Stanley said with 
a big smile. He reached for the cornflakes box in the center of the table and filled 
his bowl up with a second helping. 

Grandpa Kurt grunted behind his newspaper. 

“Go ahead—eat them before they get soggy,” Grandma Miriam urged from 
the sink. 

Mark and I just stared at each other. Last summer, Grandma Miriam had 
made us a big stack of chocolate chip pancakes almost every morning! 

What is going on here? I wondered once again. 

I suddenly remembered Sticks out in the cornfields the day before, 
whispering to me, “Things are different here.” 

They sure were different. And not for the better, I decided. 

My stomach grumbled. I picked up the spoon and started to eat my 
cornflakes. I saw Mark glumly spooning his. And then I suddenly remembered 
the twitching scarecrows. 

“Grandpa Kurt—” I started. “Last night, Mark and I—we were looking out 
at the cornfields and we saw the scarecrows. They were moving. We—” 

I heard Grandma Miriam utter a low gasp from behind me. 

Grandpa Kurt lowered his newspaper. He narrowed his eyes at me, but 
didn’t say a word. 

“The scarecrows were moving!” Mark chimed in. 

Stanley chuckled. “It was the wind,” he said, his eyes on Grandpa Kurt. “It 
had to be the wind blowing them around.” 

Grandpa Kurt glared at Stanley. “You sure?” he demanded. 

“Yeah. It was the wind,” Stanley replied tensely. 

“But they were trying to get off their poles!” I cried. “We saw them!” 

Grandpa Kurt stared hard at Stanley. 

Stanley’s ears turned bright red. He lowered his eyes. “It was a breezy 
night,” he said. “They move in the wind.” 

“It’s going to be a sunny day,” Grandma Miriam said brightly from the sink. 

“But the scarecrows—” Mark insisted. 

“Yep. Looks like a real pretty day,” Grandpa Kurt mumbled, ignoring Mark. 

He doesn’t want to talk about the scarecrows, I realized. 



Is it because he doesn’t believe us? 

Grandpa Kurt turned to Stanley. “After you take the cows to pasture, maybe 
you and Jodie and Mark can do some fishing at the creek.” 

“Maybe,” Stanley replied, studying the cornflakes box. “Maybe we could 
just do that.” 

“Sounds like fun,” Mark said. Mark likes fishing. It’s one of his favorite 
sports because you don’t have to move too much. 

There’s a really pretty creek behind the cow pasture at the far end of 
Grandpa Kurt’s property. It’s very woodsy back there, and the narrow creek 
trickles softly beneath the old shade trees and is usually filled with fish. 

Finishing my cereal, I turned to Grandma Miriam at the sink. “And what 
are you doing today?” I asked her. “Maybe you and I could spend some time 
together and—” 

I stopped as she turned toward me and her hand came into view. 

“Ohhhh.” I let out a frightened moan when I saw her hand. It—it was made 
of straw! 



7 


“Jodie—what’s the matter?” Grandma Miriam asked. 

I started to point to her hand. 

Then it came into sharp focus, and I saw that her hand wasn’t straw—she 
was holding a broom. 

She had gripped it by the handle and was pulling lint off the ends of the 
straw. 

“Nothing’s wrong,” I told her, feeling like a total jerk. I rubbed my eyes. 
“I’ve got to take my allergy medicine,” I told her. “My eyes are so watery. I keep 
seeing things!” 

I was seeing scarecrows everywhere I looked! 

I scolded myself for acting so crazy. 

Stop thinking about scarecrows, I told myself. Stanley was right. The 
scarecrows had moved in the wind last night. 

It was just the wind. 


* * * 


Stanley took us fishing later that morning. As we started off for the creek, he 
seemed in a really cheerful mood. 

He smiled as he swung the big picnic basket Grandma Miriam had packed 
for our lunch. “She put in all my favorites,” Stanley said happily. 

He patted the basket with childish satisfaction. 

He had three bamboo fishing poles tucked under his left arm. He carried the 
big straw basket in his right hand. He refused to let Mark and me carry anything. 

The warm air smelled sweet. The sun beamed down in a cloudless, blue 
sky. Blades of recently cut grass stuck to my white sneakers as we headed across 
the back yard. 

The medicine had helped. My eyes were much better. 

Stanley turned just past the barn and began walking quickly along its back 
wall. His expression turned solemn. He appeared to be concentrating hard on 
something. 

“Hey—where are we going?” I called, hurrying to keep up with him. 



He didn’t seem to hear me. Taking long strides, swinging the straw picnic 
basket as he walked, he headed back in the direction we started from. 

“Hey—wait up!” Mark called breathlessly. My brother hates to hurry when 
he can take his time. 

“Stanley—wait!” I cried, tugging his shirtsleeve. “We’re going around in 
circles!” 

He nodded, his expression serious under the black baseball cap. “We have 
to circle the barn three times,” he said in a low voice. 

“Huh? Why?” I demanded. 

We started our second turn around the barn. 

“It will bring us good luck with our fishing,” Stanley replied. Then he 
added, “It’s in the book. Everything is in the book.” 

I opened my mouth to tell him this was really silly. But I decided not to. He 
seemed so serious about that superstition book of his. I didn’t want to spoil it for 
him. 

Besides, Mark and I could use the exercise. 

A short while later, we finished circling and started walking along the dirt 
path that led past the cornfields to the creek. Stanley’s smile returned 
immediately. 

He really believes the superstitions in the book, I realized. 

I wondered if Sticks believed them, too. 

“Where’s Sticks?” I asked, kicking a big clump of dirt across the path. 

“Doing chores,” Stanley replied. “Sticks is a good worker. A real good 
worker. But he’ll be along soon, I bet. Sticks never likes to miss out on a fishing 
trip.” 

The sun began to feel really strong on my face and on my shoulders. I 
wondered if I should run back and get some sunblock. 

The dark-suited scarecrows appeared to stare at me as we walked past the 
tall rows of cornstalks. I could swear their pale, painted faces turned to follow 
me as I went by. 

And did one of them lift its arm to wave a straw hand at me? 

I scolded myself for such stupid thoughts, and turned my eyes away. 

Stop thinking about scarecrows, Jodie! I told myself. 

Forget your bad dream. Forget about the dumb scarecrows. 

It’s a beautiful day, and you have nothing to worry about. Try to relax and 
have a good time. 



The path led into tall pine woods behind the cornfields. It got shady and 
much cooler as soon as we stepped into the woods. 

“Can’t we take a taxi the rest of the way?” Mark whined. A typical Mark 
joke. He really would take a taxi if there was one! 

Stanley shook his head. “City kids,” he muttered, grinning. 

The path ended, and we continued through the trees. It smelled so piney and 
fresh in the woods. I saw a tiny, brown-and-white chipmunk dart into a hollow 
log. 

In the near distance I could hear the musical trickle of the creek. 

Suddenly, Stanley stopped. He bent and picked up a pinecone. 

The three fishing poles fell to the ground. He didn’t seem to notice. He held 
the pinecone close to his face, studying it. 

“A pinecone on the shady side means a long winter,” he said, turning the 
dry cone in his hand. 

Mark and I bent to pick up the poles. “Is that what the book says?” Mark 
asked. 

Stanley nodded. He set the pinecone down carefully where he found it. 

“The cone is still sticky. That’s a good sign,” he said seriously. 

Mark let out a giggle. I knew he was trying not to laugh at Stanley. But the 
giggle escaped somehow. 

Stanley’s big brown eyes filled with hurt. “It’s all true, Mark,” he said 
quietly. “It’s all true.” 

“I—I’d like to read that book,” Mark said, glancing at me. 

“It’s a very hard book,” Stanley replied. “I have trouble with some of the 
words.” 

“I can hear the creek,” I broke in, changing the subject. “Let’s go. I want to 
catch some fish before lunchtime.” 

The clear water felt cold against my legs. The smooth rocks of the creek bed 
were slippery under my bare feet. 

All three of us had waded into the shallow creek. Mark had wanted to be 
down on the grassy shore to fish. But I convinced him it was much more fun— 
and much easier to catch something—if you stand in the water. 

“Yeah, I’ll catch something,” he grumbled as he rolled up the cuffs of his 
jeans. “I’ll catch pneumonia!” 

Stanley let out a loud laugh. It sounded like, “Har! Har! Har!” 



He set the big picnic basket down carefully on the dry grass. Then he rolled 
up the legs of his denim overalls. Carrying a pole high in one hand, he stepped 
into the water. 

“Ooooh! It’s cold!” he cried, waving his arms above his head, nearly losing 
his balance on the slippery rocks. 

“Stanley—didn’t you forget something?” I called to him. 

He turned, confused. His big ears became bright red. “What did I forget, 
Jodie?” 

I pointed to his fishing pole. “How about some bait?” I called. 

He glanced at the empty hook on the end of his line. Then he made his way 
back to shore to get a worm to bait his hook. 

A few minutes later, all three of us were in the water. Mark complained at 
first about how cold it was and about how the rocks on the bottom hurt his 
delicate little feet. 

But after a while, he got into it, too. 

The creek at this point was only about two feet deep. The water was very 
clear and trickled rapidly, making little swirls and dips over the rocky bottom. 

I lowered my line into the water and watched the red plastic float bob on 
the surface. If it started to sink, I’d know I had a bite. 

The sun felt warm on my face. The cool water flowed past pleasantly. 

I wish it were deep enough to swim here, I thought. 

“Hey—I’ve got something!” Mark cried excitedly. 

Stanley and I turned and watched him tug up his line. 

Mark pulled with all his might. “It—it’s a big one, I think,” he said. 

Finally, he gave one last really hard tug—and pulled up a thick clump of 
green weeds. 

“Good one, Mark,” I said, rolling my eyes. “It’s a big one, all right.” 

“You’re a big one,” Mark shot back. “Abig jerk.” 

“Don’t be such a baby,” I muttered. 

I brushed away a buzzing horsefly and tried to concentrate on my line. But 
my mind started to wander. It always does when I’m fishing. 

I found myself thinking about the tall scarecrows in the field. They stood so 
darkly, so menacingly, so alert. Their painted faces all had the same hard stare. 

I was still picturing them when I felt the hand slip around my ankle. 

The straw scarecrow hand. 

It reached up from the water, circled my ankle, and started to tighten its 



cold, wet grip around my leg. 



8 


I screamed and tried to kick the hand away. 

But my feet slipped on the smooth rocks. My hands shot up as I toppled 
backwards. 

“Ohh!” I cried out again as I hit the water. 

The scarecrow hung on. 

On my back, the water rushing over me, I kicked and thrashed my arms. 

And then I saw it. The clump of green weeds that had wrapped itself around 
my ankle. 

“Oh, no,” I moaned out loud. 

No scarecrow. Only weeds. 

I lowered my foot to the water. I didn’t move. I just lay there on my back, 
waiting for my heart to stop pounding, feeling once again like a total jerk. 

I glanced up at Mark and Stanley. They were staring down at me, too 
startled to laugh. 

“Don’t say a word,” I warned them, struggling to my feet. “I’m warning 
you—don’t say a word.” 

Mark snickered, but he obediently didn’t say anything. 

“I didn’t bring a towel,” Stanley said with concern. “I’m sorry, Jodie, I 
didn’t know you wanted to swim.” 

That made Mark burst out in loud guffaws. 

I shot Mark a warning stare. My T-shirt and shorts were soaked. I started to 
shore, carrying the pole awkwardly in front of me. 

“I don’t need a towel,” I told Stanley. “It feels good. Very refreshing.” 

“You scared away all the fish, Jodie,” Mark complained. 

“No. You scared them away. They saw your face!” I replied. I knew I was 
acting like a baby now. But I didn’t care. I was cold and wet and angry. 

I stomped onto the shore, shaking water from my hair. 

“I think they’re biting better down here,” I heard Stanley call to Mark. I 
turned to see him disappear around a curve of the creek. 

Stepping carefully over the rocks, Mark followed after him. They were both 
hidden from view behind the thick trees. 



I squeezed my hair, trying to get the creek water out. Finally, I gave up and 
tossed my hair behind my shoulder. 

I was debating what to do next when I heard a crackling sound in the 
woods. 

A footstep? 

I turned and stared into the trees. I didn’t see anyone. 

A chipmunk scurried away over the blanket of dead, brown leaves. Had 
someone—or something —frightened the chipmunk? 

I listened hard. Another crackling footstep. Rustling sounds. 

“Who—who’s there?” I called. 

The low bushes rustled in reply. 

“Sticks—is that you? Sticks?” My voice trembled. 

No reply. 

It has to be Sticks, I told myself. This is Grandpa Kurt’s property. No one 
else would be back here. 

“Sticks—stop trying to scare me!” I shouted angrily. 

No reply. 

Another footstep. The crack of a twig. 

More rustling sounds. Closer now. 

“Sticks—I know it’s you!” I called uncertainly. “I’m really tired of your 
dumb tricks. Sticks?” 

My eyes stared straight ahead into the trees. 

I listened. Silence now. 

Heavy silence. 

And then I raised my hand to my mouth as I saw the dark figure poke out 
from the shade of two tall pines. 

“Sticks—?” 

I squinted into the deep blue shadows. 

I saw the bulging, dark coat. The faded burlap head. The dark fedora hat 
tilted over the black, painted eyes. 

I saw the straw poking out under the jacket. The straw sticking out from the 
long jacket sleeves. 

A scarecrow. 

A scarecrow that had followed us? Followed us to the creek? 

Squinting hard into the shadows, staring at its evil, frozen grin, I opened my 
mouth to scream—but no sound came out. 



9 


And then a hand grabbed my shoulder. 

“Ohh!” I let out a cry and spun around. 

Stanley stared at me with concern. He and Mark had come up behind me. 

“Jodie, what’s the matter?” Stanley asked. “Mark and I—we thought we 
heard you calling.” 

“What’s up?” Mark asked casually. The line on his fishing pole had become 
tangled, and he was working to untangle it. “Did you see a squirrel or 
something?” 

“No—I—I—” My heart was pounding so hard, I could barely speak. 

“Cool your jets, Jodie,” Mark said, imitating me. 

“I saw a scarecrow!” I finally managed to scream. 

Stanley’s mouth dropped open. 

Mark narrowed his eyes suspiciously at me. “A scarecrow? Here in the 
woods?” 

“It—it was walking,” I stammered. “I heard it. I heard it walking.” 

A choking sound escaped Stanley’s open mouth. 

Mark continued to stare at me, his features tight with fear. 

“It’s over there!” I cried. “Right there! Look!” 

I pointed. 

But it was gone. 



10 


Stanley stared hard at me, his big brown eyes filled with confusion. 

“I saw it,” I insisted. “Between those two trees.” I pointed again. 

“You did? A scarecrow? Really?” Stanley asked. I could see he was really 
starting to get scared. 

“Well... maybe it was just the shadows,” I said. I didn’t want to frighten 
Stanley. 

I shivered. “I’m soaked. I’ve got to get back in the sunlight,” I told them. 

“But did you see it?” Stanley asked, his big eyes locked on mine. “Did you 
see a scarecrow here, Jodie?” 

“I—I don’t think so, Stanley,” I replied, trying to calm him down. “I’m 
sorry.” 

“This is very bad,” he murmured, talking to himself. “This is very bad. I 
have to read the book. This is very bad.” Then, muttering to himself, he turned 
and ran. 

“Stanley—stop!” I called. “Stanley—come back! Don’t leave us down 
here!” 

But he was gone. Vanished into the woods. 

“I’m going after him,” I told Mark. “And then I’m going to tell Grandpa 
Kurt about this. Can you carry back the fishing poles by yourself?” 

“Do I have to?” Mark whined. My brother is so lazy! 

I told him he had to. Then I went running along the path through the woods 
toward the farmhouse. 

My heart pounded as I reached the cornfields. The dark-coated scarecrows 
appeared to stare at me. As my sneakers thudded on the narrow dirt path, I 
imagined the straw arms reaching for me, reaching to grab me and pull me into 
the corn. 

But the scarecrows kept their silent, still watch over the cornstalks. They 
didn’t move or twitch as I hurtled past. 

Up ahead I saw Stanley running to his little house. I cupped my hands over 
my mouth and called to him, but he disappeared inside. 

I decided to find Grandpa Kurt and tell him about the scarecrow I saw 
moving through the woods. 



The barn door was open, and I thought I saw someone moving around 
inside. “Grandpa Kurt?” I called breathlessly. “Are you in there?” 

My wet hair bounced on my shoulders as I ran into the barn. I stood in the 
rectangle of light that stretched from the doorway and stared into the darkness. 
“Grandpa Kurt?” I called, struggling to catch my breath. 

My eyes slowly adjusted to the dim light. I stepped deeper into the barn. 
“Grandpa Kurt? Are you here?” 

Hearing a soft scraping sound against the far wall, I made my way toward 
it. “Grandpa Kurt—can I talk to you? I really need to talk to you!” My voice 
sounded tiny and frightened in the big, dark barn. My sneakers scraped over the 
dry straw floor as I walked toward the back. 

I spun around as I heard a rumbling sound. 

The light grew dimmer. 

“Hey—” I shouted. Too late. 

The barn door was sliding shut. 

“Hey! Who’s there?” I cried out in stunned anger. “Hey—stop!” 

I slipped over the straw as I started to lurch toward the sliding door. I fell 
down hard, but quickly scrambled to my feet. 

I darted toward the door. But I wasn’t fast enough. 

As the heavy door rumbled shut, the rectangle of light grew narrower, 
narrower. 

The door slammed with a deafening bang. 

The darkness slid around me, circled me, covered me. 

“Hey—let me out!” I screamed. “Let me out of here!” 

My scream ended in a choked sob. My breath escaped in noisy gasps. 

I pounded on the wooden barn door with both fists. Then I frantically swept 
my hands over the door, searching blindly for a latch, for something to pull— 
some way to open the door. 

When I couldn’t find anything, I pounded on the door until my fists hurt. 

Then I stopped and took a step back. 

Calm down, Jodie, I told myself. Calm down. You’ll get out of the barn. 
You’ll find a way out. It’s not like you’re trapped in here forever. 

I tried to force away my panic. I held my breath, waiting for my heart to 
stop racing. Then I let my breath out slowly. Slooooowly. 

I was just starting to feel a little better when I heard the scraping sound. 

A dry scraping. The sound of a shoe crunching over straw. 



“Oh.” I let out a sharp cry, then raised both hands to my face and listened. 
Scrape. Scrape. Scrape. 

The sound of footsteps. Slow, steady footsteps, so light on the barn floor. 
Footsteps coming toward me in the darkness. 



11 


“Who—who’s there?” I choked out, my voice a hushed whisper. 

No reply. 

Scrape. Scrape. Scrape. 

The soft, scratchy footsteps came closer. 

“Who is it?” I cried shrilly. 

No reply. 

I stared into the darkness. I couldn’t see a thing. 

Scrape. Scrape. 

Whoever—or whatever—was moving steadily toward me. 

I took a step back. Then another. 

I tried to cry out, but my throat was choked with fear. 

I let out a terrified gasp as I backed into something. In my panic, it took me 
a few seconds to realize that it was only a wooden ladder. The ladder that led up 
to the hayloft. 

The footsteps crunched closer. Closer. 

“Please—” I uttered in a tiny, choked voice. “Please—don’t—” 

Closer. Closer. Scraping toward me through the heavy darkness. 

I gripped the sides of the ladder. “Please—leave me alone!” 

Before I realized what I was doing, I was pulling myself up the ladder. My 
arms trembled, and my legs felt as if they each weighed a thousand pounds. 

But I scrambled rung by rung toward the hayloft, away from the 
frightening, scraping footsteps down below. 

When I reached the top, I lay flat on the hayloft floor. I struggled to listen, 
to hear the footsteps over the loud pounding of my heart. 

Was I being followed? Was the thing chasing me up the ladder? 

I held my breath. I listened. 

Scrabbling sounds. Scraping footsteps. 

“Go away!” I screamed frantically. “Whoever you are—go away!” 

But the sounds continued, dry and scratchy. Like straw brushing against 
straw. 

Scrambling to my knees, I turned to the small, square hayloft window. 



Sunlight filtered in through the window. The light made the hay strewn over the 
floor gleam like slender strands of gold. 

My heart still pounding, I crawled to the window. 

Yes! The heavy rope was still tied to the side. The rope that Mark and I 
always used to swing down to the ground. 

I can get out of here! I told myself happily. 

I can grab the rope and swing out of the hayloft. I can escape! 

Eagerly, I grabbed the rope with both hands. 

Then I poked my head out the window and gazed down to the ground. 

And let out a scream of surprise and horror. 



12 


Gazing down, I saw a black hat. Beneath it, a black coat. 

A scarecrow. Perched outside the barn door. As if standing guard. 

It jerked its arms and legs at the sound of my scream. 

And as I stared in disbelief, it hurried around the side of the barn, hobbling 
on its straw legs, its arms flapping at its sides. 

I blinked several times. 

Was I seeing things? 

My hands were cold and wet. I gripped the rope more tightly. Taking a deep 
breath, I plunged out of the small square window. 

The heavy rope swung out over the front of the barn. 

Down, down. I hit the ground hard, landing on my feet. 

“Ow!” I cried out as the rope cut my hands. 

I let go and ran around to the side of the barn. 

I wanted to catch up to that scarecrow. I wanted to see if it really was a 
scarecrow, a scarecrow that could run. 

Ignoring my fear, I ran as fast as I could. 

No sign of him on this side of the barn. 

My chest began to ache. My temples throbbed. 

I turned the corner and headed around the back of the barn, searching for 
the fleeing scarecrow. 

And ran right into Sticks! 

“Hey—” We both shouted in surprise as we collided. 

I frantically untangled myself from him. Staring past him, I saw that the 
scarecrow had vanished. 

“What’s the hurry?” Sticks demanded. “You practically ran me over!” 

He was wearing faded denim jeans, slashed at both knees, and a faded 
purple muscle shirt that only showed off how skinny he was. His black hair was 
tied back in a short ponytail. 

“A—a scarecrow!” I stammered. 

And, then—that instant—I knew. 

In that instant, I solved the whole mystery of the scarecrows. 



13 


It hadn’t been a scarecrow. 

It was Sticks. 

In the woods down by the creek. And, now, outside the barn. 

Sticks. Playing another one of his mean tricks. 

And I was suddenly certain that Sticks had somehow made the scarecrows 
twitch and pull on their stakes last night. 

Sticks just loved fooling the “city kids”. Ever since Mark and I had been 
little, he’d played the scariest, meanest practical jokes on us. 

Sometimes Sticks could be a nice guy. But he had a real cruel streak. 

“I thought you were fishing,” he said casually. 

“Well, I’m not,” I snapped. “Sticks, why do you keep trying to scare us?” 

“Huh?” He pretended he didn’t know what I was talking about. 

“Sticks, give me a break,” I muttered. “I know you were the scarecrow just 
now. I’m not stupid!” 

“Scarecrow? What scarecrow?” he asked, giving me a wide-eyed, innocent 
expression. 

“You were dressed as a scarecrow,” I accused him. “Or else you carried one 
here, and pulled it on a string or something.” 

“You’re totally crazy,” Sticks replied angrily. “Have you been out in the sun 
too long or something?” 

“Sticks—give up,” I said. “Why are you doing this? Why do you keep 
trying to scare Mark and me? You scared your Dad, too.” 

“Jodie, you’re nuts!” he exclaimed. “I really don’t have time to be dressing 
up in costumes just to amuse you and your brother.” 

“Sticks—you’re not fooling me,” I insisted. “You—” 

I stopped short when I saw Sticks’ expression change. “Dad!” he cried, 
suddenly frightened. “Dad! You say he was scared?” 

I nodded. 

“I’ve got to find him!” Sticks exclaimed frantically, “He—he could do 
something terrible !” 

“Sticks, your joke has gone far enough!” I cried. “Just stop it!” 



But he was already running toward the front of the barn, calling for his 
father, his voice shrill and frantic. 

Sticks didn’t find his dad until dinnertime. That’s the next time I saw him, too— 
just before dinner. He was carrying his big superstition book, holding it tightly 
under his arm. 

“Jodie,” he whispered, motioning for me to come close. His face was red. 
His dark eyes revealed his excitement. 

“Hi, Stanley,” I whispered back uncertainly. 

“Don’t tell Grandpa Kurt about the scarecrow,” Stanley whispered. 

“Huh?” Stanley’s request caught me off guard. 

“Don’t tell your grandpa,” Stanley repeated. “It will only upset him. We 
don’t want to frighten him, do we?” 

“But, Stanley—” I started to protest. 

Stanley raised a finger to his lips. “Don’t tell, Jodie. Your grandpa doesn’t 
like to be upset. I’ll take care of the scarecrow. I have the book.” He tapped the 
big book with his finger. 

I started to tell Stanley that the scarecrow was only Sticks, playing a mean 
joke. But Grandma Miriam called us to the table before I could get the words 
out. 

Stanley carried his superstition book to the table. Every few bites, he would 
pick up the big, black book and read a few paragraphs. 

He moved his lips as he read. But I was sitting down at the other end of the 
table and couldn’t make out any of the words. 

Sticks kept his eyes down on his plate and hardly said a word. I think he 
was really embarrassed that his father was reading the superstition book at the 
dinner table. 

But Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam didn’t act the least bit surprised. 
They talked cheerfully to Mark and me and kept passing us more food—as if 
they didn’t even notice Stanley’s behavior. 

I really wanted to tell Grandpa Kurt about how Sticks was trying to scare 
Mark and me. But I decided to listen to Stanley and not upset my grandfather. 

Besides, I could deal with Sticks if I had to. He thought he was so tough. 
But I wasn’t the least bit afraid of him. 

Stanley was still reading, jabbering away as he read, as Grandma Miriam 
cleared the dinner dishes. Mark and I helped. Then we took our seats as 



Grandma Miriam carried a big cherry pie to the table. 

“Weird,” Mark whispered to me, staring at the pie. 

He was right. “Doesn’t Grandpa Kurt like apple pie?” I blurted out. 

Grandma Miriam gave me a tense smile. “Too early in the year for apples,” 
she murmured. 

“But isn’t Grandpa Kurt allergic to cherries?” Mark asked. 

Grandma Miriam started cutting the pie with a silver pie cutter. “Everyone 
loves cherry pie,” she replied, concentrating on her work. Then she raised her 
eyes to Stanley. “Isn’t that right, Stanley?” 

Stanley grinned over his book. “It’s my favorite,” he said. “Grandma 
Miriam always serves my favorite.” 

After dinner, Grandpa Kurt once again refused to tell Mark and me a scary story. 

We were sitting around the fireplace, staring at the crackling yellow flames. 
Even though it had been so hot, the air had grown cool this evening, cool enough 
to build a nice, toasty fire. 

Grandpa Kurt was in his rocking chair at the side of the hearth. The old 
wooden chair creaked as he rocked slowly back and forth. 

He had always loved to gaze at the fire and tell us one of his frightening 
stories. You could see the leaping flames reflected in his blue eyes. And his 
voice would go lower and lower as the story got scarier. 

But tonight he shrugged when I asked him for a story. He stared dully at the 
huge stuffed bear on its pedestal against the wall. Then he glanced across the 
room at Stanley. 

“Wish I knew some good stories,” Grandpa Kurt replied with a sigh. “But 
I’ve clean run out.” 

A short while later, Mark and I trudged upstairs to our bedrooms. “What is 
his problem?” Mark whispered as we climbed. 

I shook my head. “Beats me.” 

“He seems so... different,” Mark said. 

“Everyone here does,” I agreed. “Except for Sticks. He’s still trying to scare 
us city kids.” 

“Let’s just ignore him,” Mark suggested. “Let’s just pretend we don’t see 
him running around in his stupid scarecrow costume.” 

I agreed. Then I said good-night and headed into my room. 

Ignore the scarecrows, I thought as I arranged the blankets on the bed. 



Just ignore them. 

I’m not going to think about scarecrows again, I told myself. 

Sticks can go jump in the creek. 

Climbing into bed, I pulled the quilt up to my chin. I lay on my back, 
staring up at the cracks in the ceiling, trying to figure out what kind of picture 
they formed. There were three jagged cracks. I decided they looked like bolts of 
lightning. 

If I squinted, I could make them look like an old man with a beard. 

I yawned. I felt really sleepy, but I couldn’t get to sleep. 

It was only my second night here at the farm. It always takes me awhile to 
adjust to being in a new place and sleeping in a different bed. 

I closed my eyes. Through the open window, I could hear the soft mooing 
of cows from the barn. 

And I could hear the whisper of the wind as it brushed through the tall 
cornstalks. 

My nose was totally stuffed up. Bet I snore tonight, I thought. 

That is, if I ever get to sleep! 

I tried counting sheep. It didn’t seem to be working, so I tried counting 
cows. Big, bulky, bouncing, sloooooow-moooooving cows. 

I counted to a hundred twelve before I decided that wasn’t working, either. 

I turned onto my side. Then, after a few minutes, I tried my other side. 

I found myself thinking about my best friend, Shawna. I wondered if 
Shawna was having a good time at camp. 

I thought about some of my other friends. Most of them were just hanging 
around this summer, not doing much of anything. 

When I glanced at the clock, I was surprised to see it was nearly twelve. 
I’ve got to get to sleep, I told myself. I’ll be wrecked tomorrow if I don’t get 
some sleep. 

I settled onto my back, pulling the soft quilt up to my chin again. I closed 
my eyes and tried to picture nothing. Just empty, black space. Endless, empty 
space. 

The next thing I knew, I was hearing scratching sounds. 

I ignored them at first. I thought the curtains were flapping against the open 
window. 

Got to get to sleep, I urged myself. Got to get to sleep. 

The scratching grew louder. Closer. 



I heard a scraping sound. 

From outside the window? 

I opened my eyes. Shadows danced on the ceiling. I realized I was holding 
my breath. 

Listening hard. 

Another scrape. More scratching. Dry scratching. 

I heard a low groan. 

“Huh?” A startled gasp escaped my lips. 

I pulled myself up against the headboard. I tugged the quilt up to my chin, 
gripping it tightly with both hands. 

I heard more dry scraping. Like sandpaper, I thought. 

Suddenly the room grew darker. 

I saw something pull itself up to the window. A dark figure. Blocking the 
moonlight. 

“Who—who’s there?” I tried to call. But my voice came out a choked 
whisper. 

I could see a shadowy head, black against the purple sky. 

It rose up in the window. Dark shoulders. Followed by a darker chest. Black 
against black. 

A silent shadow, slipping into my room. 

“H-help! ” Another stammered whisper. 

My heart had stopped beating. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t breathe. 

It slid over the windowsill. Brushed away the curtains as it lowered itself 
into my room. 

Its feet scraped over the bare floorboards. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

It moved slowly, steadily toward my bed. 

I struggled to get up. 

Too late. 

My feet tangled in the quilt. 

I fell to the floor, landing hard on my elbows. 

I raised my eyes to see it move closer. 

I opened my mouth to scream as it emerged from the shadows. 

And then I recognized him. Recognized his face. 

“Grandpa Kurt!” I cried. “Grandpa Kurt—what are you doing here? Why 



did you climb in the window?” 

He didn’t reply. His cold blue eyes glared down at me. His whole face 
twisted into an ugly frown. 

And then he raised both arms above me. 

And I saw that he had no hands. 

Clumps of straw poked out from his jacket sleeves. 

Only straw. 

“Grandpa—no!!” I shrieked. 



14 


“Grandpa— please — no!” I shrieked as he lowered his straw arms toward me. 

He bared his teeth like an angry dog and let out a sharp, frightening growl. 
The straw hands reached down for me. 

Grandpa Kurt’s face was the same. The face I had always known. Except 
that his eyes were so cold, so cold and dead. 

The straw hands brushed over my face as I climbed to my feet. I took a step 
back, raising my hands like a shield. 

“Grandpa—what’s wrong? What’s happening?” I whispered. 

My temples were pounding. My entire body shook. 

His cold eyes narrowed in fury as he reached for me again. 

“Noooo!” I let out a long wail of terror. Then I turned and stumbled to the 

door. 

His feet scraped over the bare floor as he lurched toward me. Glancing 
down, I saw the straw poking out from the cuffs of his pants. 

His feet—they were straw, too. 

“Grandpa Kurt! Grandpa Kurt! What is happening ?” Was that really my 
voice, so shrill and frightened? 

He swung an arm. The straw scratched my back as it swept over me. 

I grabbed for the doorknob. Twisted it. Pulled open the door. 

And cried out again as I collided with Grandma Miriam. 

“Oh, help! Please help! Grandma Miriam—he’s chasing me!” I cried. 

Her expression didn’t change. She stared back at me. 

In the dim light of the hallway, her face came into focus. 

And I saw that her glasses were painted on. 

And her eyes. And mouth. And big round nose. 

Her entire face was painted on. 

“You’re not real!” I cried. 

And then darkness swept over me as Grandpa Kurt’s straw hands wrapped 
around my face. 



15 


I woke up coughing and choking. 

Surrounded by darkness. Heavy darkness. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that I’d been sleeping with the pillow 
over my face. 

Tossing it to the foot of the bed, I pulled myself up, breathing hard. My face 
was hot. My nightshirt stuck wetly to my back. 

I glanced at the window, suddenly afraid that I’d see a dark figure climbing 
in. 

The curtains fluttered gently. The early morning sky was still gray. I heard 
the shrill cry of a rooster. 

A dream. It had all been a frightening nightmare. 

Taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly, I lowered my feet to the floor. 

I stared at the gray morning light through the window. Just a dream, I 
assured myself. Calm down, Jodie. It was just a dream. 

I could hear someone moving around downstairs. Staggering over to the 
dresser, I pulled out some fresh clothes—a pair of faded denim cutoffs, a 
sleeveless blue T-shirt. 

My eyes were watery. Everything was a blur. My allergies were really bad 
this morning. 

Rubbing my eyes, I made my way to the window and peered out. A red ball 
of a sun was just peeking over the broad apple tree. A heavy morning dew made 
the grass of the back yard sparkle like emeralds. 

The sea of cornstalks rose darkly behind the grass. The scarecrows stood 
stiffly over them, arms outstretched as if welcoming the morning. 

The rooster crowed again. 

What a stupid nightmare, I thought. I shook myself as if trying to shake it 
from my memory. Then I ran a brush through my hair and hurried down to 
breakfast. 

Mark was just entering the kitchen as I came in. We found Grandma 
Miriam by herself at the table. A mug of tea steamed in front of her as she gazed 
out the window at the morning sunlight. 

She turned and smiled at us as we entered. “Good morning. Sleep well?” 



I was tempted to tell her about my scary nightmare. But, instead, I asked, 
“Where’s Grandpa Kurt?” I stared at his empty chair. The newspaper lay 
unopened on the table. 

“They all went off early,” Grandma Miriam replied. 

She stood up, walked to the cabinets, and brought a big box of cornflakes to 
the table. She motioned for us to take our places. “Pretty day,” she said 
cheerfully. 

“No pancakes?” Mark blurted out. 

Grandma Miriam stopped halfway across the room. “I’ve completely 
forgotten how to make them,” she said without turning around. 

She set two bowls down and made her way to the refrigerator to get the 
milk. “You kids want orange juice this morning? It’s fresh squeezed.” 

Grandma Miriam set the milk carton down beside my bowl. She smiled at 
me. Her eyes remained dull behind her square-rimmed glasses. “I hope you two 
are enjoying your visit,” she said quietly. 

“We would be if it weren’t for Sticks,” I blurted out. 

Her expression turned to surprise. “Sticks?” 

“He’s trying to scare us again,” I said. 

Grandma Miriam tsk-tsked. “You know Sticks,” she replied softly. 

She pushed at her red hair with both hands. “What are you two planning for 
today?” she asked brightly. “It’s a beautiful morning to go riding. Before they 
left this morning, Grandpa Kurt had Stanley saddle up Betsy and Maggie, in case 
you wanted to ride.” 

“Sounds like fun,” I told her. “What do you say, Mark? Before it gets really 
hot out?” 

“I guess,” Mark replied. 

“You two always enjoyed riding along the creek,” Grandma Miriam said, 
putting the cornflakes box away. 

I stared across the room at her, stared at her red, curly hair, her pudgy arms, 
her flowered housedress. 

“Are you okay, Grandma Miriam?” I asked. The words just tumbled out of 
my mouth. “Is everything okay here?” 

She didn’t reply. Instead, she lowered her eyes, avoiding my gaze. “Go 
have your ride,” she said quietly. “Don’t worry about me.” 


Grandpa Kurt always called Betsy and Maggie the “old gray mares”. I guess 



because they were both old and they were both gray. And they were as grumpy 
as can be when Mark and I climbed onto their saddles and started to urge them 
from the barn. 

They were the perfect horses for us “city kids”. The only time we ever got 
to ride horses was during our summers at the farm. So we were not exactly the 
most skillful riders in the world. 

Bumping along on these two old nags was just our speed. And even as slow 
as we were moving, I dug my knees into Betsy’s sides and held onto the saddle 
horn for dear life. 

We followed the dirt path past the cornfields toward the woods. The sun 
was still climbing a hazy, yellow sky. But the air was already hot and sticky. 

Flies buzzed around me as I bounced on top of Betsy. I removed one hand 
from the saddle horn to brush a big one off Betsy’s back. 

Several scarecrows stared back at us as Mark and I rode past. Their black 
eyes glared at us from under their floppy hats. 

Mark and I didn’t say a word. We were keeping to our promise of not 
talking about scarecrows. 

I turned my eyes to the woods and tossed the reins, urging Betsy to move a 
little faster. She ignored me, of course, and kept clopping along over the path at 
her slow, steady pace. 

“I wonder if these horses can still get up to a trot,” Mark called. He was a 
few paces behind me on the narrow dirt path. 

“Let’s give it a try!” I called back, grabbing the reins tighter. 

I dug my sneaker heels into Betsy’s side. “Go, girl—go!” I cried, slapping 
her gently with the reins. 

“Whoooa!” I let out a startled cry as the old horse obediently began to trot. I 
really didn’t think she would cooperate! 

“All right! Cool!” I heard Mark shout behind me. 

Their hooves clopped loudly on the path as the two horses began to pick up 
speed. I was bouncing hard over the saddle, holding on tightly, off-balance, 
beginning to wonder if this was such a hot idea. 

I didn’t have a chance to cry out when the dark figure hurtled across the 

path. 

It all happened so fast. 

Betsy was trotting rapidly. I was bouncing on the saddle, bouncing so hard, 
my feet slipped out of the stirrups. 



The dark figure leaped out right in front of us. 

Betsy let out a shrill, startled whinny—and reared back. 

As I started to fall, I saw immediately what had jumped onto the path. 
It was a grinning scarecrow. 



16 


Betsy rose up with a high whinny. 

My hand grabbed for the reins, but they slipped from my grasp. 

The sky appeared to roll over me, then tilt away. 

I slid backwards, out of the saddle, off the horse, my feet thrashing wildly 
for the flapping stirrups. 

The sky tilted even more. 

I hit the ground hard on my back. 

I remember only the shock of stopping so abruptly, the surprise at how hard 
the ground felt, how so much pain shot through my body so quickly. 

The sky turned bright red. A glowing scarlet. Like an explosion. 

And then the scarlet faded to deep, deep, endlessly deep black. 


* * * 


I heard low moans before I opened my eyes. 

I recognized the voice. Mark’s voice. 

My eyes still shut, I opened my mouth to call to him. My lips moved, but 
no sound came out. 

“Ohhhh.” Another low groan from him, not far from me. 

“Mark—?” I managed to choke out. My back ached. My shoulders hurt. My 
head throbbed. 

Everything hurt. 

“My wrist—I think I broke it,” Mark said, his voice shrill and frightened. 
“You fell, too?” I asked. 

“Yeah. I fell, too,” he groaned. 

I opened my eyes. Finally. I opened my eyes. 

And saw the hazy sky. 

All a blur. Everything was a watery blur. 

I stared at the sky, trying to get it in focus. 

And then saw a hand in front of the sky. A hand lowering itself toward me. 
A bony hand stretching out from a heavy black coat. 



The hand of the scarecrow, I realized, staring up helplessly at it. 
The hand of the scarecrow, coming down to grab me. 



17 


The hand grabbed my shoulder. 

Too terrified to cry out, too dazed to think clearly, my eyes followed the 
dark coat sleeve—up to the shoulder—up to the face. 

A blur. All a frightening blur. 

And then the face became clear. 

“Stanley!” I cried. 

He leaned over me, his red ears glowing, his face tight with worry. He 
gently grabbed my shoulder. “Jodie—are you all right?” 

“Stanley—it’s you!” I exclaimed happily. I sat up. “I think I’m okay. I don’t 
know. Everything hurts.” 

“What a bad fall,” Stanley said softly. “I was in the field. And I saw it. I 
saw the scarecrow....” 

His voice trailed off. I followed his frightened gaze up ahead of me on the 
dirt path. 

The scarecrow lay facedown across the path. 

“I saw it jump out,” Stanley uttered with a shudder that shook his whole 
body. 

“My wrist...” Mark moaned from nearby. 

I turned as Stanley hurried over to him. Mark was sitting up in the grass at 
the side of the path, holding his wrist. “Look—it’s starting to swell up,” he 
groaned. 

“Oooh, that’s bad. That’s bad,” Stanley said, shaking his head. 

“Maybe it’s just a sprain,” I suggested. 

“Yeah,” Stanley quickly agreed. “We’d better get you to the house and put 
ice on it. Can you get back up on Maggie? I’ll ride behind you.” 

“Where’s my horse?” I asked, searching both ways along the path. I climbed 
unsteadily to my feet. 

“She galloped back to the barn,” Stanley replied, pointing. “Fastest I’ve 
seen her go in years!” 

He glanced down at the scarecrow and shuddered again. 

I took a few steps, stretching my arms and my back. “I’m okay,” I told him. 
“Take Mark on the horse. I’ll walk back.” 



Stanley eagerly started to help Mark to his feet. I could see that Stanley 
wanted to get away from here—away from the scarecrow—as fast as possible. 

I watched as they rode off down the path toward the house. Stanley sat 
behind Mark in the saddle, holding the reins, keeping Maggie at a slow, gentle 
pace. Mark held his wrist against his chest and leaned back against Stanley. 

I stretched my arms over my head again, trying to stretch the soreness from 
my back. My head ached. But other than that, I didn’t feel bad. 

“Guess I’m lucky,” I murmured out loud. 

I took a long glance at the scarecrow, sprawled facedown across the path. 
Cautiously, I walked over to it. 

I poked its side with the toe of my sneaker. 

The straw beneath the coat crinkled. 

I poked it harder, pushing my sneaker hard into the scarecrow’s middle. 

I don’t know what I expected to happen. Did I think the scarecrow would 
cry out? Try to squirm away? 

With an angry cry, I kicked the scarecrow. Hard. 

I kicked it again. 

The burlap bag head bounced on the path. The scarecrow’s ghastly painted 
grin didn’t move. 

It’s just a scarecrow, I told myself, giving it one last kick that sent straw 
falling out from the jacket front. 

Just a scarecrow that Sticks tossed onto the path. 

Mark and I could have been killed, I told myself. 

We’re lucky we weren’t. 

Sticks. It had to be Sticks. 

But why? 

This wasn’t a joke. 

Why was Sticks trying to hurt us? 



18 


Stanley and Sticks weren’t at lunch. Grandpa Kurt said they had to go into town 
for supplies. 

Mark’s wrist was only sprained. Grandma Miriam put an ice bag on it, and 
the swelling went right down. But Mark was groaning and complaining. He was 
really making the most of it. 

“Guess I’ll have to lie on the couch and watch TV for a week or so,” he 
moaned. 

Grandma Miriam served ham sandwiches and homemade coleslaw. Mark 
and I gobbled down our lunches. All that excitement had made us really hungry. 

As we ate, I decided to tell Grandpa Kurt everything that had been 
happening. I couldn’t hold it in any longer. 

I told him about how Sticks was making the scarecrows move at night. And 
how he was trying to frighten us, trying to make us think the scarecrows were 
alive. 

I caught a glimpse of fear in Grandpa Kurt’s blue eyes. But then he rubbed 
his white-stubbled cheeks, and he got a faraway look on his face. 

“Sticks and his little jokes,” he said finally, a smile spreading across his 
face. “That boy sure likes his jokes.” 

“He’s not joking,” I insisted. “He’s really trying to frighten us, Grandpa.” 

“We could have been killed this morning!” Mark joined in. He had 
mayonnaise smeared on his cheek. 

“Sticks is a good boy,” Grandma Miriam murmured. She was smiling, too. 
She and Grandpa Kurt exchanged glances. 

“Sticks wouldn’t really hurt you,” Grandpa Kurt said softly. “He just likes 
to have his fun.” 

“Great fun!” I muttered sarcastically, rolling my eyes. 

“Yeah. Great fun,” Mark groaned. “I almost broke my wrist!” 

Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam just smiled back at us, their faces 
frozen like the painted scarecrow faces. 

After lunch, Mark slumped to the couch, where he planned to spend the rest of 
the afternoon staring at the TV. He loved having an excuse not to go outdoors. 



I heard Stanley’s truck pull up the drive. I decided to go find Sticks and tell 
him how fed up we were with his stupid scarecrow tricks. 

I didn’t think his jokes were all in fun. I really believed he was trying to 
frighten us or hurt us—and I wanted to find out why. 

I didn’t see Sticks or Stanley out in the yard. So I made my way across the 
grass to the guest house where they lived. 

It was a warm, beautiful day. The sky was clear and bright. The air smelled 
fresh and sweet. 

But I couldn’t enjoy the sunshine. All I could think about was letting Sticks 
know how angry I was. 

I knocked on the guest house door. I took a deep breath and tossed my hair 
behind my shoulders, listening for signs of life inside. 

I tried to think of what I was going to say to Sticks. But I was too angry to 
plan it. My heart started to pound. I realized I was breathing hard. 

I knocked on the door again, harder this time. 

There was no one inside. 

I turned my gaze to the cornfields. The stalks stood stiffly, watched over by 
the motionless scarecrows. No sign of Sticks. 

I turned to the barn, across the wide grass from the guest house. Maybe 
Sticks is in there, I thought. 

I jogged to the barn. Two enormous crows hopped along the ground in front 
of the open barn doors. They flapped their wings hard and scrambled out of my 
way. 

“Hey—Sticks?” I shouted breathlessly as I stepped inside. 

No reply. 

The barn was dark. I waited for my eyes to adjust. 

Remembering my last creepy visit to the barn, I stepped reluctantly, my 
sneakers scraping over the straw on the floor. “Sticks? Are you in here?” I 
called, staring hard into the deep shadows. 

A rusted baling machine stood to one side of the straw bales. A 
wheelbarrow tilted against the wall. I hadn’t noticed them before. 

“Guess he isn’t here,” I said to myself out loud. 

I walked past the wheelbarrow. I saw something else I hadn’t noticed before 
—a pile of old coats on the barn floor. Empty burlap bags were stacked beside 
them. 

I picked one up. It had a frowning face painted on it in black paint. I 



dropped the bag back onto the pile. 

These must be Stanley’s scarecrow supplies, I realized. 

How many more scarecrows did he plan to build? 

Then something in the corner caught my eye. I walked quickly over the 
straw. Then I bent down to examine what I saw. 

Torches. At least a dozen torches, stacked in the corner, hidden by the 
darkness. Next to them I spotted a large bottle of kerosene. 

What on earth are these doing here? I asked myself. 

Suddenly, I heard a scraping sound. I saw shadows slide against shadows. 
And I realized that once again I was no longer alone. 

I jumped to my feet. “Sticks!” I cried. “You scared me.” 

His face was half hidden in darkness. His black hair fell over his forehead. 
He didn’t smile. “I warned you,” he said menacingly. 



19 


Feeling the fear rise to my throat, I stepped out of the corner and moved past 
him, into the light from the doorway. “I—I was looking for you,” I stammered. 
“Sticks, why are you trying to scare Mark and me?” 

“I warned you,” he said, lowering his voice to a whisper. “I warned you to 
get away from here, to go back home.” 

“But why?” I demanded. “What’s your problem, Sticks? What did we do to 
you? Why are you trying to scare us?” 

“I’m not,” Sticks replied. He glanced back nervously to the barn doors. 

“Huh?” I gaped at him. 

“I’m not trying to scare you. Really,” he insisted. 

“Liar,” I muttered angrily. “You must really think I’m a moron. I know you 
threw that scarecrow onto our path this morning. It had to be you, Sticks.” 

“I really don’t know what you’re talking about,” he insisted coldly. “But 
I’m warning you—” 

A sound at the doorway made him stop. 

We both saw Stanley step into the barn. He shielded his eyes with one hand 
as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. “Sticks—are you in here?” he called. 

Sticks’ features tightened in sudden fear. He let out a low gasp. 

“I—I’ve got to go,” Sticks whispered tensely to me. He turned and started 
jogging toward Stanley. “Here I am, Dad,” he called. “Is the tractor ready?” 

I watched the two of them hurry from the barn. Sticks didn’t look back. 

I stood in the darkness, my eyes on the empty doorway, thinking hard. 

I know Sticks was lying to me, I thought. 

I know he made the scarecrows move at night. I know he dressed as a 
scarecrow to scare me in the woods and at the barn. And I know he tossed that 
scarecrow in front of the horses this morning. 

I know he’s trying to frighten Mark and me. 

But enough is enough, I decided. 

Now it’s payback time. 

Now it’s time for Sticks to be frightened. Really frightened. 



20 


“I can’t do this!” Mark protested. 

“Of course you can,” I assured him. “This is going to be really cool.” 

“But my wrist hurts again,” my brother whined. “It just started hurting. I 
can’t use it.” 

“No problem,” I told him. “You won’t have to use it.” 

He started to protest some more. But then a smile spread across his face, 
and his eyes lit up gleefully. “It’s kind of a cool idea,” he said, laughing. 

“Of course it’s an awesome idea,” I agreed. “I thought of it!” 

We were standing in the doorway to the barn. The white light from a full 
moon shone down on us. Owls hooted somewhere nearby. 

It was a cool, clear night. The grass shimmered from a heavy dew. A soft 
wind made the trees whisper. The moonlight was so bright, I could see every 
blade of grass. 

After Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam had gone to bed, I dragged Mark 
from the house. I pulled him across the yard to the barn. 

“Wait right here,” I said. Then I hurried into the barn to get what we 
needed. 

It was a little creepy in the dark barn at night. I heard a soft fluttering sound 
high in the rafters. 

Probably a bat. 

My sneakers were wet from the grass. I slid over the straw on the barn 
floor. 

The bat swooped low over my head. I heard a high-pitched chittering up in 
the rafters. More bats. 

I grabbed one of the big, old coats from the pile. Then I pulled up one of the 
burlap bag faces and slung it on top of the coat. 

Ignoring the fluttering wings swooping back and forth, back and forth, 
across the barn, I hurried outside to Mark. 

And explained my plan, my plan to get our revenge on Sticks. 

It was actually a very simple plan. We’d dress Mark up as a scarecrow. 
He’d stand with the other scarecrows in the cornfield. 

I’d go to the guest house and get Sticks. I’d tell Sticks I saw something 



weird in the field. I’d pull Sticks out to the field. Mark would start to stagger 
toward him—and Sticks would be so freaked, he’d have a cow! 

A simple plan. And a good one. 

Sticks deserved it, too. 

I pulled the burlap bag over Mark’s head. The black, painted eyes stared 
back at me. I reached down, picked up a handful of straw, and began stuffing it 
under the bag. 

“Stop squirming!” I told Mark. 

“But the straw itches!” he cried. 

“You’ll get used to it,” I told him. I grabbed his shoulders. “Stand still. 
Don’t move.” 

“Why do I need straw?” he whined. 

“Mark, you have to look like all the other scarecrows,” I told him. 
“Otherwise, Sticks won’t be fooled.” 

I stuffed the burlap face with straw. Then I held up the old overcoat for 
Mark to put on. 

“I can’t do this!” he wailed. “I’m going to itch to death! I can’t breathe!” 

“You can breathe perfectly fine,” I told him. I stuffed straw into the sleeves. 
I was careful to let clumps of straw hang from the cuffs, covering Mark’s hands. 
Then I stuffed more straw into the jacket. 

“Will you stand still?” I whispered angrily. “This is a lot of hard work—you 
know?” 

He grumbled in a low voice to himself as I continued to work. 

“Just keep thinking how great it’ll be when Sticks sees you and thinks 
you’re a scarecrow that’s really coming to life,” I said. 

I had straw stuck to my hands, straw all down the front of my sweatshirt 
and jeans. I sneezed. Once. Twice. I’m definitely allergic to the stuff. 

But I didn’t care. I was so excited. I couldn’t wait to see Sticks’ terrified 
face. I couldn’t wait to pay him back for trying to frighten us all week. 

“I need a hat,” Mark said. He was standing stiffly, afraid to move under all 
the straw. 

“Hmmmm.” I thought hard. There weren’t any hats in the barn with the 
other scarecrow supplies. “We’ll just take one off a real scarecrow,” I told Mark. 

I stepped back to see my handiwork. Mark looked pretty good. But he still 
needed more straw. I set to work, stuffing him, making the old coat bulge. 

“Now don’t forget to stand straight and stiff, with your arms straight out,” I 



instructed. 

“Do I have a choice?” Mark complained. “I—I can’t move at all!” 

“Good,” I said. I arranged the straw that stuck out of his sleeves, then 
stepped back. “Okay. You’re ready,” I told him. 

“How do I look?” he asked. 

“Like a short scarecrow,” I told him. 

“I’m too short?” he replied. 

“Don’t worry, Mark,” I said, grabbing his arm. “I’m going to stick you up 
on a pole!” 

“Huh?” 

I laughed. “Gotcha,” I muttered. “I’m kidding.” I started to lead him to the 
cornfields. 

“Think this is going to work?” Mark asked, walking stiffly. “Think we’re 
really going to scare Sticks?” 

I nodded. An evil grin spread over my face. “I think so,” I told my brother. 
“I think Sticks is in for a terrifying surprise.” 

Little did I know that we all were! 



21 


I gripped Mark’s arm with both hands and led him to the cornfields. The bright 
moon bathed us in white light. The tall cornstalks shivered in a light breeze. 

Mark looked so much like a scarecrow, it was scary. Tufts of straw stuck 
out at his neck and the cuffs of his coat. The enormous old coat hung loosely 
over his shoulders and came down nearly to his knees. 

We stepped into the field. Our sneakers crunched over the dry ground as we 
edged through a narrow row. 

The cornstalks rose above our heads. The breeze made them lean over us, 
as if trying to close us in. 

I let out a gasp as I heard a rustling sound along the ground. 

Footsteps? 

Mark and I both froze. And listened. 

The tall stalks bent low as the wind picked up. They made an eerie creaking 
sound as they moved. The ripe corn sheaths bobbed heavily. 

Creeeeak. Creeeeak. 

The stalks shifted back and forth. 

Then we heard the rustling again. A soft brushing sound. 

Very nearby. 

“Ow. Let go!” Mark whispered. 

I suddenly realized I was still gripping his arm, squeezing it tightly. 

I let go. And listened. “Do you hear it?” I whispered to Mark. “That 
brushing sound?” 

Creeeeak. Creeeeak. 

The cornstalks leaned over us, shifting in the wind. 

A twig cracked. So nearby, I nearly jumped out of my skin. 

I held my breath. My heart was racing. 

Another soft rustling sound. I stared down at the ground, trying to follow 
the sound. 

“Oh.” 

A large gray squirrel scampered across the row and disappeared between 
the stalks. 



I burst out laughing, mostly from relief. “Just a squirrel,” I said. “Do you 
believe it? Just a squirrel!” 

Mark let out a long, relieved sigh from under the burlap bag. “Jodie, can we 
get going?” he demanded impatiently. “This thing itches like crazy!” 

He raised both hands and tried to scratch his face through the bag. But I 
quickly tugged his arms down. “Mark—stop. You’ll mess up the straw!” 

“But my face feels like a hundred bugs are crawling all over it!” he wailed. 
“And I can’t see. You didn’t cut the eyeholes big enough.” 

“Just follow me,” I muttered. “And stop complaining. You want to scare 
Sticks, don’t you?” 

Mark didn’t reply. But he let me lead him deeper into the cornfield. 

Suddenly, a black shadow fell over our path. 

I let out a sharp gasp before I realized it was the long shadow of a 
scarecrow. 

“How do you do,” I said, reaching out and shaking its straw hand. “May I 
borrow your hat?” 

I reached up and pulled the brown, floppy hat off the burlap head. Then I 
lowered it over Mark’s burlap head and pulled it down tight. 

“Hey—!” Mark protested. 

“I don’t want it to fall off,” I told him. 

“I’m never going to stop itching!” Mark whined. “Can you scratch my 
back? Please? My whole back is itching!” 

I gave the back of the old coat a few hard mbs. “Turn around,” I instructed 
him. I gave him a final inspection. 

Excellent. He looked more like a scarecrow than the scarecrows did. 

“Stand right here,” I told him, moving him into a small clearing between 
two rows of cornstalks. “Good. Now when you hear me bringing Sticks over, put 
your arms straight out. And don’t move a muscle.” 

“I know, I know,” Mark grumbled. “Think I don’t know how to be a 
scarecrow? Just hurry—okay?” 

“Okay,” I told him. I turned and made my way quickly along the shifting 
rows of cornstalks. Dry straw and leaves crackled beneath my sneakers. 

I was breathing hard by the time I reached the guest house. The doorway 
was dark. But an orange light glowed dimly behind the pulled shade in the 
window. 

I hesitated at the doorway and listened. Silence inside. 



How was I going to get Sticks to come out alone—without his father? 

I didn’t want to frighten Stanley. He was a really nice man, who would 
never think of playing mean jokes on Mark and me. And I knew how scared and 
upset he could get. 

I only wanted to frighten Sticks. To teach him a lesson. To teach him he had 
no business getting on our case just because Mark and I are “city kids”. 

The wind fluttered through my hair. I could hear the cornstalks creaking 
behind me in the fields. 

I shivered. 

Taking a deep breath, I raised my fist to knock on the door. 

But a sound behind me made me spin around. 

“Hey—!” I choked out. 

Someone was moving across the grass, half running, half stumbling. My 
eyes were all watery. It was hard to see. 

Was it Mark? 

Yes. I recognized the floppy hat, the bulky, dark overcoat falling down past 
his knees. 

What is he doing? I asked myself, watching him approach. 

Why is he following me? 

He’s going to ruin the whole joke! 

As he came closer, he raised a straw hand as if pointing at me. 

“Mark—what’s wrong?” I called in a loud whisper. 

He continued to gesture with his straw hand as he ran. 

“Mark—get back in the field!” I whispered. “You’re not supposed to follow 
me. You’re going to ruin everything! Mark—what are you doing here?” 

I motioned with both hands for him to go back to the cornfield. 

But he ignored me and kept coming, trailing straw as he ran. 

“Mark, please—go back! Go back!” I pleaded. 

But he stepped up in front of me and grabbed my shoulders. 

And as I stared into the cold, painted black eyes—I realized to my horror 
that it xvasn’t Mark! 



22 


I cried out and tried to pull away. 

But the scarecrow held on to me tightly. 

“Sticks—is that you?” I cried in a trembling voice. 

No reply. 

I stared into the blank, painted eyes. 

And realized there were no human eyes behind them. 

The straw hands scratched against my throat. 

I opened my mouth to scream. 

And the door to the guest house swung open. “Sticks—” I managed to 
choke out. 

Sticks stepped out onto the small stoop. “What on earth—!” he cried. 

He leaped off the stoop, grabbed the scarecrow by the coat shoulders—and 
heaved it to the ground. 

The scarecrow hit the ground without making a sound. It lay sprawled on its 
back, staring up at us blankly. 

“Who—who is it?” I cried, rubbing my neck where the straw hands had 
scratched it. 

Sticks bent down and jerked away the burlap scarecrow head. 

Nothing underneath. Nothing but straw. 

“It—it really is a scarecrow!” I cried in horror. “But it— walked !” 

“I warned you,” Sticks said solemnly, staring down at the headless dark 
figure. “I warned you, Jodie.” 

“You mean it wasn’t you?” I demanded. “It wasn’t you trying to scare Mark 
and me?” 

Sticks shook his head. He raised his dark eyes to mine. “Dad brought the 
scarecrows to life,” he said softly. “Last week. Before you came. He used his 
book. He chanted some words—and they all came to life.” 

“Oh, no,” I murmured, raising my hands to my face. 

“We were all so frightened,” Sticks continued. “Especially your 
grandparents. They begged Dad to recite the words and put the scarecrows back 
to sleep.” 



“Did he?” I asked. 

“Yes,” Sticks replied. “He put them back to sleep. But first he insisted your 
grandparents make some promises. They had to promise not to laugh at him 
anymore. And they had to promise to do everything he wanted from now on.” 

Sticks took a deep breath. He stared toward the guest house window. 
“Haven’t you noticed how different things are at the farm? Haven’t you noticed 
how frightened your grandparents are?” 

I nodded solemnly. “Of course I have.” 

“They’ve been trying to keep Dad happy,” Sticks continued. “They’ve been 
doing everything they can to keep him from getting upset or angry. Your 
grandmother fixes only his favorite food. Your grandfather stopped telling scary 
stories because Dad doesn’t like them.” 

I shook my head. “They’re that afraid of Stanley?” 

“They’re afraid he’ll read the chant in the book again and bring the 
scarecrows back to life,” Sticks said. He swallowed hard. “There’s only one 
problem,” he murmured. 

“What’s that?” I asked. 

“Well, I haven’t told Dad yet. But...” His voice trailed off. 

“But what?” I demanded eagerly. 

“Some of the scarecrows are still alive,” Sticks replied. “Some of them 
never went back to sleep.” 



23 


We both let out short cries as the front door to the house swung open. 

Startled, I leaped away from the doorway. 

As the door pulled open, it revealed a rectangle of orange light. Stanley 
stepped into the light. 

He held on to the door and peered out. His eyes showed surprise as they 
landed on Sticks and me. But then he goggled and uttered a choking sound as he 
spotted the headless scarecrow on the ground. 

“N-no!” Stanley sputtered. He pointed a trembling finger at the scarecrow. 
“It—it walks! The scarecrow walks!” 

“No, Dad—!” Sticks cried. 

But Stanley didn’t hear him. Stanley had already dived back into the house. 

Sticks started after him. But Stanley reappeared in the doorway. As he 
stepped outside, I saw that he was carrying the big superstition book. 

“The scarecrows walk!” Stanley screamed. “I must take charge! I must take 
charge of them all now!” 

His eyes were wild. His entire skinny body was trembling. He started 
toward the cornfields, totally crazy. Sticks tried to calm him down. 

“No, Dad!” Sticks cried desperately, hurrying after him. “The scarecrow 
was dropped here! I dropped it here, Dad! It didn’t walk! It didn’t walk!” 

Stanley kept walking, taking long, rapid strides. He didn’t seem to hear 
Sticks. “I must take charge now!” Stanley declared. “I must be the leader. I will 
bring the others back to life and take control.” 

He turned and glanced at Sticks, who was hurrying to catch up to him. 
“Stay back!” Stanley shouted. “Stay back—until I read the chant! Then you can 
follow!” 

“Dad—please listen to me!” Sticks cried. “The scarecrows are ah asleep! 
Don’t wake them!” 

Stanley finally stopped a few yards from the edge of the cornfields. He 
turned to Sticks and studied his face. “You’re sure? You’re sure they’re not out 
of my control? You’re sure they’re not walking?” 

Sticks nodded. “Yes. I’m sure, Dad. I’m really sure.” 

Stanley’s face filled with confusion. He kept staring hard at Sticks, as if not 



believing him. “I don’t have to read the chant?” Stanley asked, confused, his 
eyes on the swaying cornstalks. “I don’t have to take charge?” 

“No, Dad,” Sticks replied softly. “The scarecrows are all still. You can put 
the book away. The scarecrows are not moving.” 

Stanley sighed with relief. He lowered the book to his side. “None of 
them?” he asked warily. 

“None of them,” Sticks replied soothingly. 

And that’s when Mark—in full scarecrow costume—decided to come 
staggering out of the cornfield. 



24 


“Where’ve you been?” Mark called. 

Stanley’s eyes went wide, and he opened his mouth in a high shriek of 
terror. 

“Dad, please—!” Sticks pleaded. 

Too late. 

Stanley took off, heading into the cornfields, the big book raised high in 
front of him. “The scarecrows walk! They walk!” he cried. 

Mark tucked at the burlap bag face. “Did we blow it?” he called. “Is the 
joke over? What’s happening?” 

There was no time to answer him. 

Sticks turned to me, his features tight with fear. “We’ve got to stop Dad!” 
he cried. He started running to the swaying cornstalks. 

Stanley had already disappeared between the tall rows of corn. 

My allergies were really bad. I kept rubbing my eyes, trying to clear them. 
But as I followed Sticks, everything was a shimmering blur of grays and blacks. 

“Ow!” I cried out as I stumbled in a soft hole and fell. 

Mark, right behind me, nearly toppled over me. 

He reached down and helped pull me up. I had landed hard on both knees, 
and they were throbbing with pain. 

“Which way did they go?” I asked breathlessly, searching the dark, swaying 
rows of creaking cornstalks. 

“I—I’m not sure!” Mark stammered. “What’s going on, Jodie? Tell me!” 

“Not now!” I told him. “We have to stop Stanley. We have to—” 

Stanley’s voice, high and excited, rose up from somewhere nearby. Mark 
and I both froze as we listened to the strange words he was chanting. 

“Is he reading something from that weird book?” Mark demanded. 

Without answering, I headed in the direction of Stanley’s voice. It was easy 
to follow him. He was chanting the strange words at the top of his lungs. 

Where was Sticks? I wondered. 

Why hadn’t Sticks been able to stop his father? 

I pushed frantically through the tall stalks. I was moving blindly, my eyes 



watered over, brushing the stalks out of the way with both hands. 

In a small clearing, I found Stanley and Sticks. They were standing in front 
of two scarecrows on poles. 

Stanley held the book up close to his face as he chanted, moving his finger 
over the words. 

Sticks stood frozen, a blank expression on his face, a face of cold terror. 

Had the words of the chant somehow frozen him there like that? 

The scarecrows stood stiffly on their poles, their painted eyes staring 
lifelessly out from under their floppy black hats. 

Mark and I stepped into the clearing just as Stanley finished his chant. He 
slammed the big book shut and tucked it under one arm. 

“They’re going to walk now!” Stanley cried excitedly. “They’re going to 
come alive again!” 

Sticks suddenly seemed to come back to life. He blinked several times and 
shook his head hard, as if trying to clear it. 

We all stared at the two scarecrows. 

They stared back at us, lifeless, unmoving. 

The clouds floated away from the moon. The shadow over the cornfields 
rolled away. 

I stared into the eerie, pale light. 

A heavy silence descended over us. The only sounds I could hear were 
Stanley’s shallow breathing, tense gasps as he waited for his chant to work, for 
his scarecrows to come to life. 

I don’t know how long we stood there, none of us moving a muscle, 
watching the scarecrows. Watching. Watching. 

“It didn’t work,” Stanley moaned finally. His voice came out sad and low. 
“I did something wrong. The chant—it didn’t work.” 

A smile grew on Sticks’ face. He gazed at me. “It didn’t work!” Sticks 
exclaimed happily. 

And then I heard the scratch scratch scratch of dry straw. 

I saw the scarecrows’ shoulders start to twitch. I saw their eyes light up and 
their heads lean forward. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

The dry straw crinkled loudly as they both squirmed off their poles and 
lowered themselves silently to the ground. 



25 


“Go warn your grandparents!” Sticks cried. “Hurry! Go tell them what my dad 
has done! ” 

Mark and I hesitated. We stared at the scarecrows as they stretched their 
arms and rolled their burlap bag heads, as if waking up after a long sleep. 

“Jodie—look!” Mark choked out in a hushed whisper. He pointed out to the 
fields. 

I gasped in horror as I saw what Mark was staring at. 

All over the field, dark-coated scarecrows were stretching, squirming, 
lowering themselves from their poles. 

More than a dozen of them, silently coming to life. 

“Run!” Sticks was screaming. “Go! Tell your grandparents!” 

Stanley stood frozen in place, gripping the book in both hands. He stared in 
amazement, shaking his head, enjoying his triumph. 

Sticks’ face was knotted with fear. He gave my shoulders a hard shove. 
“Run!” 

The scarecrows were rolling their heads back and forth, stretching out their 
straw arms. The dry scratch of straw filled the night air. 

I forced myself to take my eyes off them. Mark and I turned and started 
mnning through the cornfield. We pushed the tall stalks away with both hands as 
we ran. We ducked our heads low, running in terrified silence. 

We ran across the grass, past the guest house. Past the dark, silent barn. 

The farmhouse loomed darkly ahead of us. The windows were dark. A dim 
porch light sent a circle of yellow light over the back porch. 

“Hey—!” Mark shouted, pointing. 

Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam must have heard our shouts back in the 
cornfields. They were waiting for us in the back yard. 

They looked frail and frightened. Grandma Miriam had pulled a flannel 
bathrobe over her nightdress. She had a scarf tied over her short red hair. 

Grandpa Kurt had pulled his overalls on over his pajamas. He leaned 
heavily on his cane, shaking his head as Mark and I came running up. 

“The scarecrows—!” I exclaimed breathlessly. 

“They’re walking!” Mark cried. “Stanley—he—” 



“Did you get Stanley upset?” Grandpa Kurt asked, his eyes wide with fear. 
“Who got Stanley upset? He promised us he wouldn’t do it again! He promised 
—if we didn’t upset him.” 

“It was an accident!” I told him. “We didn’t mean to. Really!” 

“We’ve worked so hard to keep Stanley happy,” Grandma Miriam said 
sadly. She chewed her lower lip. “So hard...” 

“I didn’t think he’d do it,” Grandpa Kurt said, his eyes on the cornfields. “I 
thought we convinced him it was too dangerous.” 

“Why are you dressed like that?” Grandma Miriam asked Mark. 

I was so frightened and upset, I had completely forgotten that Mark was 
still dressed as a scarecrow. 

“Mark, did you dress like that to scare Stanley?” Grandma Miriam 
demanded. 

“No!” Mark cried. “It was supposed to be a joke! Just a joke!” 

“We were trying to scare Sticks,” I told them. “But when Stanley saw Mark, 
he...” 

My voice trailed off as I saw the dark figures step out of the cornfields. 

In the silvery moonlight, I saw Stanley and Sticks. They were running hard, 
leaning forward as they ran. Stanley held the book in front of him. His shoes 
slipped and slid over the wet grass. 

Behind them came the scarecrows. They were moving awkwardly, 
staggering, lurching silently forward. 

Their straw arms stretched straight forward, as if reaching to grab Stanley 
and Sticks. Their round, black eyes glowed blankly in the moonlight. 

Staggering, tumbling, falling, they came after Stanley and Sticks. A dozen 
twisted figures in black coats and hats. Leaving clumps of straw as they pulled 
themselves forward. 

Grandma Miriam grabbed my arm and squeezed it in terror. Her hand was 
as cold as ice. 

We watched Stanley fall, then scramble to his feet. Sticks helped pull him 
up, and the two of them continued to run toward us in terror. 

The silent scarecrows lurched and staggered closer. Closer. 

“Help us— please !” Stanley called to us. 

“What can we do?” I heard Grandpa Kurt mutter sadly. 



26 


The four of us huddled close together, staring in helpless horror as the 
scarecrows made their way, chasing Stanley and Sticks across the moonlit lawn. 

Grandma Miriam held on to my arm. Grandpa Kurt leaned heavily, 
squeezing the handle of his cane. 

“They won’t obey me!” Stanley screamed breathlessly. He stopped in front 
of us, holding the book in one hand. 

His chest was heaving up and down as he struggled to catch his breath. 
Despite the coolness of the night, sweat poured down his forehead. 

“They won’t obey me! They must obey me! The book says so!” Stanley 
cried, frantically waving the book in the air. 

Sticks stopped beside his father. He turned to watch the scarecrows 
approach. “What are you going to do?” he asked his father. “You have to do 
something!” 

“They’re alive!” Stanley shrieked. “Alive!” 

“What does the book say?” Grandpa Kurt demanded. 

“They’re alive! They’re all alive!” Stanley repeated, his eyes wild with 
fright. 

“Stanley—listen to me!” Grandpa Kurt yelled. He grabbed Stanley by the 
shoulders and spun him around to face him. “Stanley—what does the book say 
to do? How do you get them in control?” 

“Alive,” Stanley murmured, his eyes rolling in his head. “They’re all alive.” 

“Stanley—what does the book say to do?” Grandpa Kurt demanded once 
again. 

“I—I don’t know,” Stanley replied. 

We turned back to the scarecrows. They were moving closer. Spreading out. 
Forming a line as they staggered toward us. Their arms reached forward 
menacingly, as if preparing to grab us. 

Clumps of straw fell from their sleeves. Straw spilled from their coats. 

But they continued to lurch toward us. Closer. Closer. 

The black, painted eyes stared straight ahead. They leered at us with their 
ugly, painted mouths. 

“Stop!” Stanley screamed, raising the book high over his head. “I command 



you to stop!” 

The scarecrows lurched slowly, steadily forward. 

“Stop!” Stanley shrieked in a high, frightened voice. “I brought you to life! 
You are mine! Mine! I command you! I command you to stop!” 

The blank eyes stared straight at us. The arms reached stiffly forward. The 
scarecrows pulled themselves closer. Closer. 

“Stop! I said stop!” Stanley screeched. 

Mark edged closer to me. Behind his burlap mask I could see his eyes. 
Terrified eyes. 

Ignoring Stanley’s frightened pleas, the scarecrows dragged themselves 
closer. Closer. 

And then I did something that changed the whole night. 

I sneezed. 



27 


Mark was so startled by my sudden, loud sneeze that he let out a short cry and 
jumped away from me. 

To my amazement, the scarecrows all stopped moving forward—and 
jumped back, too. 

“Whoa!” I cried. “What’s going on here?” 

The scarecrows all seemed to have trained their painted eyes on Mark. 

“Mark—quick—raise your right hand!” I cried. 

Mark gazed at me through the burlap bag. I could see confusion in his eyes. 

But he obediently raised his right hand high over his head. 

And the scarecrows all raised their right hands! 

“Mark—they’re imitating you!” Grandma Miriam cried. 

Mark raised both hands in the air. 

The scarecrows copied him again. I heard the scratch of straw as they lifted 
both arms. 

Mark tilted his head to the left. The scarecrows tilted their heads to the left. 

Mark dropped to his knees. The scarecrows sank in their straw, slaves to my 
brother’s every move. 

“They—they think you’re one of them,” Grandpa Kurt whispered. 

“They think you’re their leader !” Stanley cried, staring wide-eyed at the 
scarecrows slumped on the ground. 

“But how do I make them go back to their poles?” Mark demanded 
excitedly. “How do I make them go back to being scarecrows?” 

“Dad—find the right chant!” Sticks yelled. “Find the right words! Make 
them sleep again!” 

Stanley scratched his short, dark hair. “I—I’m too scared!” he confessed 
sadly. 

And then I had an idea. 

“Mark—” I whispered, leaning close to him. “Pull off your head.” 

“Huh?” He gazed at me through the burlap mask. 

“Pull off your scarecrow head,” I urged him, still whispering. 

“But why?” Mark demanded. He waved his hands in the air. The 



scarecrows obediently waved their straw hands in the air. 

Everyone was staring at me, eager to hear my explanation. 

“If you pull off your scarecrow head,” I told Mark, “then they will pull off 
their heads. And they’ll die.” 

Mark hesitated. “Huh? You think so?” 

“It’s worth a try,” Grandpa Kurt urged. 

“Go ahead, Mark. Hurry!” Sticks cried. 

Mark hesitated for a second. Then he stepped forward, just inches from the 
dark-coated scarecrows. 

“Hurry!” Sticks urged him. 

Mark gripped the top of the burlap bag with both hands. “I sure hope this 
works,” he murmured. Then he gave the bag a hard tug and pulled it off. 



28 


The scarecrows stopped moving. They stood still as statues as they watched 
Mark pull off his scarecrow head. 

Mark stared back at them, holding the burlap bag between his hands. His 
hair was matted wetly to his forehead. He was dripping with sweat. 

The scarecrows hesitated for a moment more. 

A long, silent moment. 

I held my breath. My heart was pounding. 

Then I let out a happy cry as the scarecrows all reached up with their straw 
hands—and pulled off their heads! 

The dark hats and burlap heads fell silently to the grass. 

None of us moved. We were waiting for the scarecrows to fall. 

Waiting for the headless scarecrows to collapse and fall. 

But they didn’t go down. 

Instead, they reached out their arms and moved stiffly, menacingly forward. 

“They—they’re coming to get us!” Stanley cried in a high, trembling voice. 

“Mark —do something!” I shouted, shoving him forward. “Make them stand 
on one foot or hop up and down. Stop them!” 

The headless figures dragged themselves toward us, arms outstretched. 

Mark stepped forward. He raised both hands over his head. 

The scarecrows didn’t stop, didn’t copy him. 

“Hey—hands up!” Mark shouted desperately. He waved his hands above 
his head. 

The scarecrows edged forward, silently, steadily. 

“Th-they’re not doing it!” Mark wailed. “They’re not following me!” 

“You don’t look like a scarecrow anymore,” Grandma Miriam added. “They 
don’t think you’re their leader.” 

Closer they came, staggering blindly. Closer. 

They formed a tight circle around us. 

A scarecrow brushed its straw hand against my cheek. 

I uttered a terrified cry. “Noooooo!” 

It reached for my throat, the dry straw scratching me, scratching my face, 



scratching, scratching. 

The headless scarecrows swarmed over Mark. He thrashed and kicked. But 
they were smothering him, forcing him to the ground. 

My grandparents cried out helplessly as the dark-coated figures surrounded 
them. Stanley let out a silent gasp. 

“Sticks—help me!” I shrieked as the straw hands wrapped around my neck. 
“Sticks? Sticks?” 

I glanced frantically around. 

“Sticks? Help me! Please! Where are you?” 

Then I realized to my horror that Sticks was gone. 



29 


“Sticks?” I let out a final muffled cry. 

The straw hands wrapped around my throat. The scarecrow rolled over me. 
My face was pressed into the dry straw of its chest. 

I tried to squirm free. But it held on, surrounded me, choked me. 

The straw smelled sour. Decayed. I felt sick. A wave of nausea swept over 
me. 

“Let go! Let go!” I heard Stanley pleading. 

The scarecrow was surprisingly strong. It wrapped its arms around me 
tightly, smothering me in the disgusting straw. 

I made one last attempt to pull free. Struggling with all my might, I raised 
my head. 

And saw two balls of fire. Orange streaks of light. 

Floating closer. 

And in the orange light, I saw Sticks’ face, hard and determined. 

I gave another hard tug. And tumbled backwards. 

“Sticks!” I cried. 

He was carrying two blazing torches. The torches from the barn, I realized. 
“I was saving these just in case!” Sticks called. 

The scarecrows seemed to sense danger. 

They let go of us, tried to scramble away. 

But Sticks moved quickly. 

He swept the two torches, swinging them like baseball bats. 

A scarecrow caught fire. Then another. 

Sticks made another wide swing. 

The fire crackled, a streak of orange against the darkness. 

The dry straw burst into flame. The old coats burned quickly. 

The scarecrows twisted and writhed as the bright flames danced over them. 
They sank to their backs on the ground. Burning. Burning so brightly, so silently, 
so fast. 

I took a step back, staring in horror and fascination. 

Grandpa Kurt had his arm around Grandma Miriam. They leaned close 



together, their faces reflecting the flickering flames. 

Stanley stood tensely, his eyes wide. He hugged the book tightly to his 
chest. He was murmuring to himself, but I couldn’t make out the words. 

Mark and I stood beside Sticks, who held a torch in each hand, watching 
with narrowed eyes as the scarecrows burned. 

In seconds, there was nothing left but clumps of dark ashes on the ground. 

“It’s over,” Grandma Miriam murmured softly, gratefully. 

“Never again,” I heard Stanley mutter. 

The house was quiet the next afternoon. 

Mark was out on the screen porch, lying in the hammock, reading a stack of 
comic books. Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam had gone in for their 
afternoon nap. 

Sticks had driven into town to pick up the mail. 

Stanley sat at the kitchen table, reading his superstition book. His finger 
moved over the page as he muttered the words aloud in a low voice. 

“Never again,” he had repeated at lunch. “I’ve learned my lesson about this 
book. I’ll never try to bring any scarecrows to life again. I won’t even read the 
part about scarecrows!” 

We were all glad to hear that. 

So now, on this lazy, peaceful afternoon, Stanley sat at the table, quietly 
reading some chapter of the big book. 

And I sat alone on the couch in the living room, hearing Stanley’s gentle 
murmurings from the kitchen, thinking about the night before. 

It felt good to have a quiet afternoon, to be all alone to think about what had 
happened. 

All alone... 

The only one in the room... 

The only one to hear Stanley’s low mumbling as he read the book. 

The only one to see the gigantic stuffed brown bear blink its eyes. 

The only one to see the bear lick its lips, step off its platform, snarl and paw 
the air with its enormous claws. 

The only one to hear its stomach growl as it stared down at me. 

The only one to see the hungry look on its face as it magically came out of 
its long hibernation. 

“Stanley?” I called in a tiny, high voice. “Stanley? What chapter have you 
been reading?” 




GO EAT WORMS! 
Goosebumps - 21 
R.L. Stine 


1 


Before the worms turned mean, before they slithered out to get their revenge, 
Todd Barstow had a great time with them. 

Todd collected worms. He built a worm farm in his basement. 

He studied them. He played with them. He did experiments with them. 
Sometimes he carried them around with him. 

Sometimes he scared people with them. Especially his sister, Regina. 

He liked to dangle the long, purple ones in front of Regina’s face. 
Sometimes he dropped them down her back or into her long, brown hair. 

He liked to torture Regina’s best friend, too. Her name was Beth Baker, and 
she always screamed a high, squeaky scream whenever Todd surprised her with 
a big, slimy worm. 

“You’re totally gross, Todd!” Beth would squeal. 

This always made Todd very happy. 

Todd’s best friend, Danny Fletcher, didn’t really understand why Todd was 
so interested in worms. But Danny did understand how much fun it was to 
surprise people and make them scream. So he spent a lot of time with Todd. 

In fact, the two of them were almost always together. They even sat 
together in Miss Grant’s class, where they whispered a lot, planning what to do 
next with Todd’s worms. 

Todd didn’t look at all mischievous. In fact, he usually had a very serious 
expression on his face. He had dark brown eyes under short, wavy brown hair. 
No one ever saw his hair. It was always covered by the silver-and-black Raiders 
cap he wore day and night. 

He was tall and skinny. His mother said he was as skinny as a worm. Todd 
never thought that was funny. He took worms seriously. 

Danny looked more like a joker. He had a round, chubby face under curly 
red hair, and a really goofy grin. His round blue eyes always lit up when Todd 
was about to spring a big, wet worm on an unsuspecting victim. 

Whenever Todd succeeded in making someone scream in surprise, Danny 
would toss back his head, let out a high-pitched cheer, and slap Todd hard on the 
back with his chubby, freckled hand. Then the two of them would screech with 
laughter, roll around on the floor, and enjoy their victory. 



They had a great time with worms. 

But whenever anyone asked Todd why he collected them, and why he was 
so interested in them, Todd’s expression would turn serious, and he’d say, 
“Because I want to be a scientist when I grow up.” 

“How many worms do you have?” someone asked him. 

“Not enough,” he replied. 

He was always digging up more. Looking for champions. He liked them 
long and purple and kind of fat. 

And squishy. Squishy was very important. 

Sunday night it had rained. The ground was still wet as Todd and Regina walked 
to school on Monday morning. Todd knew the worms would all be coming up 
for air. 

He found Danny at the water fountain outside their classroom. Danny had a 
finger pressed over the fountain spout, and when kids passed by, he made the 
water squirt all over them. 

Todd lowered his Raiders cap over his forehead as he leaned close to 
Danny. “Meet me behind second base on the playground,” he whispered. “As 
soon as the lunch bell rings.” 

Danny nodded. He didn’t have to ask why. He knew that Todd’s favorite 
place to dig up fresh worms was the bare patch of ground behind second base on 
the softball diamond. 

The ground there was soft and rich. And after a good rain, the two boys 
could shovel up ten to fifteen worms without even trying. 

Todd kept a gardening shovel in his locker, as well as a small metal bucket 
with a lid. He was always ready to collect worms when the time was right. 

In class that morning, everyone was talking about the big Science Expo to 
be held in the gym on Saturday. Some kids already had their projects done. 

Debby Brewster was bragging about how she was going to win the new 
computer, the grand prize, by making electricity. Someone shouted out, “Go fly a 
kite!” and everyone laughed. The whole class was tired of Debby’s constant 
bragging. 

Todd’s project was just about finished. It had worms in it, of course. 

It was a worm house. A little house Todd’s father had helped him build, 
about the size of a dollhouse. One side was cut away and covered with a pane of 
glass so you could see in. The house was filled with dirt. And you could see all 



of the worms—a whole worm family—crawling from room to room. 

Danny’s project was really boring. He was building the solar system out of 
balloons. 

He wanted to share Todd’s project and work on it with him. But Todd 
wouldn’t let him. “I don’t want to share the computer,” Todd had said. 

“But I helped you dig up the worms!” Danny protested. 

“I dug up most of them,” Todd replied. 

And so Todd forced Danny to do his own project. Danny blew up different- 
colored balloons for all the planets and taped them on a big black sheet of 
oaktag. 

Very boring. 

“What makes you so sure you’re going to win the grand prize?” Danny asked 
Todd as he hurried to catch up with him on the playground at lunchtime. 

“I checked out the other projects,” Todd replied. “My project is the only one 
with real, living creatures. Except for Heather’s snails.” 

“Heather has done a lot of experiments with her snails,” Danny commented. 

“So what?” Todd snapped. “Snails are for babies. We had snails in first 
grade. No one cares about snails in sixth grade. No way they can compete with 
worms.” 

“I guess you’re right,” Danny replied, scratching his red hair. 

They squatted down as they reached the bare spot behind second base. Todd 
handed Danny his spare shovel. 

The playground was empty. Everyone else was inside eating lunch. 

The ground was still soft and wet. Worms were poking their heads up from 
little puddles. One long worm crawled on top of the dirt. 

“The rain makes them all come up,” said Todd, beginning to dig. “This is 
excellent!” 

He didn’t know what kind of trouble was waiting under the ground. 



2 


“Look out. You cut that one in two,” Todd warned. 

Danny grinned. “So what? Now you’ve got two little ones.” 

“But I only like big ones,” Todd replied, carefully sliding his shovel under a 
long, fat worm. 

“How many more do you need? My stomach is growling,” Danny 
complained, glancing back at the long, redbrick school building. 

“Just a few more,” Todd said, lowering the fat worm into the bucket. “He’s 
a squirmer, isn’t he?” 

Danny groaned. “Everyone else is eating lunch, and I’m out here digging in 
the mud.” 

“It’s for science,” Todd said seriously. 

“This one is as big as a snake. Did you ever think of collecting snakes?” 
Danny asked. 

“No,” Todd replied quickly, digging deep into the mud. “No way.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because I like worms,” Todd said. 

“What’s the real reason?” Danny demanded. 

“My parents won’t let me,” Todd muttered. 

The two boys continued to dig for another few minutes until the ground 
started to rumble. Danny dropped his shovel. 

“What’s that?” he asked. 

“Huh?” Todd didn’t seem to notice. 

The ground rumbled a little harder. This time everything shook. 

Todd pitched forward, dropping onto his hands and knees. He gazed up at 
Danny, surprised. “Hey—don’t push me.” 

“I didn’t!” Danny protested. 

“Then what—?” Todd started. But the ground shook again. And the dirt 
made a soft cracking sound. 

“I—I don’t like this!” Danny stammered. 

Without another word, both boys started to run. 

But the ground trembled again, and the cracking sound beneath their 



sneakers grew louder. Closer. 

“Earthquake!” Todd screamed. “Earthquake!” 



3 


Todd and Danny sprinted across the field and the playground and burst into the 
lunchroom. 

Both boys had red faces. Both of them were breathing hard. 

“Earthquake!” Todd shouted. “It’s an earthquake!” 

Chairs scraped. Conversations stopped. Everyone turned to stare at the two 
of them. 

“Duck under the tables!” Danny screamed shrilly. “Quick, everyone! The 
ground is shaking!” 

“Earthquake! Earthquake!” 

Everyone just laughed. 

No one moved. 

No one wanted to fall for a dumb practical joke. 

Todd spotted Beth and Regina across the lunchroom at the window. He and 
Danny darted over to them. 

“Get away from the window!” Todd warned. 

“The ground is cracking apart!” Danny cried. 

Regina’s mouth dropped open. She didn’t know whether to believe them or 
not. Regina, the worrier, was always ready to believe a disaster waited just 
around the corner. 

But all the other kids in the huge lunchroom were laughing their heads off. 

“We don’t get earthquakes in Ohio,” Beth said simply, making a disgusted 
face at Todd. 

“But—but—but—” Todd sputtered. 

“Didn’t you feel it?” Danny demanded breathlessly, his round, chubby face 
still bright red. “Didn’t you feel the ground shake?” 

“We didn’t feel anything,” Beth replied. 

“Didn’t you hear it?” Todd cried. “I—I was so freaked, I dropped all my 
worms.” He sank into the chair next to his sister. 

“No one believes you. It’s a dumb joke, Todd,” Regina told him. “Better 
luck next time, guys.” 

“But—but—” 



Regina turned away from her sputtering brother and started talking to Beth 
again. “As I was saying, his head is way too big for his body.” 

“He looks okay to me,” Beth replied. 

“No. We’ll have to cut his head off,” Regina insisted, frowning into her 
bowl of noodle soup. 

“Major surgery?” Beth asked. “Are you sure? If we cut his head off, it’ll 
show. It really will.” 

“But if his head is too big, what choice do we have?” Regina whined. 

“Huh? What are you talking about?” Todd demanded. “What about the 
earthquake?” 

“Todd, we’re talking about our science fair project,” Beth said impatiently. 

“Yeah. Go out and play in the earthquake!” Regina snapped. “We’ve got 
problems with Christopher Robin.” 

Todd snickered. “What a dumb name for a bird.” 

Regina stuck out her tongue at him and then turned her back. She and Beth 
began discussing their project again. 

They both agreed they probably should have tried something a little easier. 
And smaller. 

They were building an enormous robin out of papier-mache. It was 
supposed to be lifelike in every detail, except size. 

But the girls quickly discovered that papier-mache isn’t the most lifelike 
material around. It was hard to get the wings to stick to the body. It was even 
harder to get the huge round body to stand on the spindly wooden legs. 

And now Regina was convinced that the bird’s head was much too big for 
its body. 

They had used an entire quart of orange paint on the bird’s chest. Now, if 
they had to cut the head off and make a new one, the paint job would be ruined! 

“Maybe we could just shave a little off the top,” Beth suggested, taking the 
last potato chip from her bag and crinkling the bag between her hands. “Can I 
have some of your soup?” 

“You can finish it,” Regina replied, sliding the bowl across the table. “I’m 
not very hungry.” 

“There’s going to be an aftershock,” Todd warned, staring out the window. 

“Yeah. There’s always an aftershock after an earthquake,” Danny agreed. 

“I can’t believe you’re sitting here calmly, talking about your dumb 
project,” Todd said. 



“It’s not a dumb project!” Beth replied angrily. 

“Todd, go eat worms!” Regina exclaimed. It was her favorite thing to say to 
her brother. She said it at least ten times a day. 

“Beth is already eating worms,” Todd said, gazing down at the bowl of 
soup. 

Danny laughed. 

“Give me a break, Todd,” Beth muttered, rolling her eyes. 

“No. Really,” Todd insisted. “What kind of soup is that?” 

“Chicken noodle,” Beth replied warily. She took a spoonful, slurping the 
soup off the spoon. 

“Well, there’s a worm in your soup,” Todd said with a serious face. 

“Todd, you’re not funny,” Beth replied. “Give up.” 

“Want to bet?” Todd challenged. 

“Bet? What do you mean ‘bet’?” Beth said. 

“I’ll bet you a dollar there’s a worm in your soup,” Todd told her, his dark 
eyes lighting up. 

Danny leaned across the table, a wide grin frozen on his chubby face. 
“Yummm,” he said, licking his lips. “Abig fat purple one! Can I have a taste?” 

“You guys are jerks,” Regina muttered. 

“Bet a dollar?” Todd challenged, ignoring his sister. 

“Sure. It’s a bet,” Beth said. 

She reached across the table and shook Todd’s hand to seal the bet. Then 
she ran the soup spoon through the bowl several times to show him there was no 
worm. 

Todd reached under the table. Then a smile crossed his face as he brought 
his hand up—and dropped a fat purple worm into Beth’s soup. 

The worm wriggled and squirmed as it hit the hot soup. 

“Oooh, gross!” Beth screamed. 

Danny let out a loud laugh and slapped Todd gleefully on the back, nearly 
knocking Todd from the chair. 

“Pay up, Beth,” Todd demanded. “You lost the bet.” 

“You guys are sick,” Regina murmured, making a disgusted face, forcing 
herself not to look into the soup bowl. 

“Gross! Gross!” Beth was shrieking. 

The worm slipped and swam through the noodles. 

“You said you dropped your worms outside,” Regina accused angrily. 



Todd shrugged, a big grin on his face. “I lied!” 

Danny laughed even harder. He pounded the table gleefully with his fists, 
making the soup bowl bounce up and down. 

“Hey!” Suddenly Todd’s smile faded. He stared out of the lunchroom 
window at the playground. 

“Look!” He hit Danny’s shoulder, then pointed out toward second base, to 
the bare spot behind the base. “What’s going on out there?” he cried. 



4 


Todd walked over to the window and peered out, pressing his nose against the 
glass. “What is Patrick MacKay doing in my worm-digging spot?” he demanded 
angrily. 

Danny stepped beside Todd. He squinted out into the gray afternoon. “Are 
you sure that’s Patrick MacKay?” 

The sky darkened as the low clouds gathered. The boy on the playground 
was half covered by shadow. But Todd recognized him anyway. 

That snobby, stuck-up, rich kid. Patrick MacKay. 

He was bent over the bare spot of mud behind second base, working 
feverishly. 

“What is he doing out there?” Todd repeated. “That’s my best worm spot!” 

“He’s digging up worms, too!” Regina declared from the table. 

“Huh?” Todd spun around to find his sister smirking at him. 

“Patrick is digging up worms for the Science Expo,” she told him, unable to 
hide her joy. “He’s doing a worm project, too.” 

“But he can’t!” Todd sputtered in a high, shrill voice. 

“Whoa! What a copycat!” Danny declared. 

“He can’t do a worm project! I’m doing the worm project!” Todd insisted, 
turning back to stare at Patrick through the glass. 

“It’s a free country,” Regina replied smugly. She and Beth laughed and 
slapped each other high fives. They were enjoying seeing Todd squirm for a 
change. 

“But he’s not into worms!” Todd continued, very upset. “He doesn’t collect 
worms! He doesn’t study worms! He’s just copying me!” 

“Look at him, digging in your spot,” Danny murmured, shaking his head 
bitterly. 

“Patrick is a nice guy,” Beth remarked. “He doesn’t act like a jerk and put 
worms in people’s soup.” 

“He’s a jerk,” Todd insisted angrily, staring hard out the window. “He’s a 
total jerk.” 

“He’s a copycat jerk,” Danny added. 

“His worm project is going to be better than yours,” Regina teased him. 



Todd’s dark eyes burned into his sister’s. “You know what it is? You know 
what Patrick’s project is?” 

Regina had a smug smile on her lips. She tossed back her brown hair. Then 
she made a zipper sign, moving her fingers across her lips. “I’ll never tell,” she 
said. 

“What is it?” Todd demanded. “Tell me.” 

Regina shook her head. 

“Tell me, Beth,” Todd insisted, narrowing his eyes menacingly at Beth. 

“No way,” Beth replied, glancing merrily at Regina. 

“Then I’ll ask him myself,” Todd declared. “Come on, Danny.” 

The two boys started running through the lunchroom. They were nearly to 
the door when Todd ran into their teacher. 

Miss Grant was carrying her lunch tray high over her head, stepping around 
a group of kids in the aisle. Todd just didn’t see her. 

He bumped her from behind. 

She uttered a cry of surprise—and her tray flew out of her hands. The tray 
and the plates clattered loudly onto the floor. And her food—salad and a bowl of 
spaghetti—dropped around her feet. 

“What is your hurry, young man?” she snapped at Todd. 

“Uh... sorry,” Todd murmured. It was the only reply he could think of. 

Miss Grant bent to examine her brown shoes, which were now orange, 
covered with wet clumps of spaghetti. 

“It was an accident,” Todd said impatiently, fiddling with his Raiders cap. 

“It sure was,” the teacher replied coldly. “Perhaps I should speak to you 
after school about why we don’t run in the lunchroom?” 

“Perhaps,” Todd agreed. Then he bolted past her, running out the door 
faster than he had ever run. 

“Cool move, ace!” Danny exclaimed, running beside him. 

“It wasn’t my fault,” Todd told him. “She stepped in front of me.” 

“The bell is going to ring,” Danny warned as they made their way out the 
back door. 

“I don’t care,” Todd replied breathlessly. “I’ve got to find out what that 
copycat is doing with worms!” 

Patrick was still bent over the mud behind second base. He was scooping up 
worms with a silvery trowel that looked brand-new, then dropping them into a 
metal bait can. 



He was a slim, good-looking boy with wavy blond hair and blue eyes. He 
had started school in September. His family had moved to Ohio from Pasadena. 
He was always telling everyone how California was so much better. 

He didn’t brag about how rich he was. But he wore designer jeans, and his 
mother brought him to school every morning in a long, white Lincoln. So Todd 
and the others at William Tecumseh Sherman Middle School figured it out. 

Patrick was in Regina’s class. A few weeks after school started, he’d had a 
big birthday party and invited everyone in his class. Including Regina. 

She reported that Patrick had a whole carnival, with rides and everything, in 
his back yard. Todd pretended he didn’t care that he wasn’t invited. 

The sky grew even darker as Danny and Todd stood over Patrick on the 
playground. “What are you doing, Patrick?” Todd demanded. 

“Digging,” Patrick replied, glancing up from his work. 

“Digging up worms?” Todd asked, his hands pressed against the waist of 
his jeans. 

Patrick nodded. He started digging again. He pulled up a long, dark brown 
one that Todd would have loved to own. 

“I’m doing a worm project,” Todd told him. 

“I know,” Patrick replied, concentrating on his work. “Me, too.” 

“What is it?” Danny chimed in. “What’s your project, Patrick?” 

Patrick didn’t reply. He dug up a tiny, pale worm, examined it, and tossed it 
back. 

“What’s your project? Tell us,” Todd demanded. 

“You really want to know?” Patrick asked, raising his blue eyes to them. 
The wind ruffled his blond hair, but the hair immediately fell back into place. 

Todd felt a raindrop on his shoulder. Then one on the top of his head. 

“What’s your project?” Todd repeated. 

“Okay, okay,” Patrick said, wiping dirt off his hands. “I’ll tell you. My 
project is...”

The class bell rang. The sharp clang cut through the rising wind. The rain started 
to patter loudly against the ground. 

“We’ve got to go in,” Danny urged, tugging at Todd’s sleeve. 

“Wait,” Todd said, his eyes on Patrick. “Tell me now!” he insisted. 

“But we’ll be late!” Danny insisted, tugging at Todd again. “And we’re 
getting soaked.” 

Patrick climbed to his feet. “I think I’ve got all the worms I need.” He 
shook wet dirt off the silvery trowel. 

“So what is your worm project?” Todd repeated, ignoring the pattering rain 
and Danny’s urgent requests to get back inside the school. 

Patrick grinned at him, revealing about three hundred perfect, white teeth. 
“I’m teaching them to fly,” he said. 

“Huh?” 

“I’m putting cardboard wings on them and teaching them to fly. Wait till 
you see it! It’s a riot!” He burst out laughing. 

Danny leaned close to Todd. “Is he for real?” he whispered. 

“Of course not!” Todd shot back. “Don’t be a jerk, Danny. He’s goofing on 

us.” 

“Hey—you’re not funny,” Danny told Patrick angrily. 

“We’re late, guys. Let’s get going,” Patrick said, his grin fading. He started 
toward the school building. 

But Todd moved quickly to block his path. “Tell me the truth, Patrick. What 
are you planning to do?” 

Patrick started to reply. 

But a low rumbling sound made him stop. 

They all heard it. A muffled roar that made the ground shake. 

The worm can fell out of Patrick’s hand. His blue eyes opened wide in 
surprise—and fear. 

The rumbling gave way to a loud, cracking noise. It sounded as if the whole 
playground were splitting apart. 

“Wh-what’s happening ?” Patrick stammered. 



“Run!” Todd screamed as the ground trembled and shook. “Run for your

“Why are you so late? Where’ve you been? In another earthquake?” Regina 
teased. 

“Ha-ha,” Todd said bitterly. “Danny and I weren’t making it up. It happened 
again! And Patrick was there, too.” 

“How come no one else felt it?” Regina demanded. “I had the radio on after 
school. And there was nothing about an earthquake on the news.” 

It was nearly five o’clock. Todd had found his sister in the garage, up on an 
aluminum ladder, working hard on her giant robin. Somehow she had managed 
to get clumps of papier-mache in her hair and down the front of her T-shirt. 

“I don’t want to talk about the earthquake,” Todd muttered, stepping into 
the garage. “I know I’m right.” 

The rain had ended just before school let out. But the driveway was still 
puddled with water. 

His wet sneakers squeaked as he made his way to Regina’s ladder. 

“Where’s Beth?” he asked. 

“She had to go get her braces tightened,” Regina told him, concentrating on 
smoothing out the papier-mache beak. She let out a loud groan. “I can’t get this 
beak smooth.” 

Todd kicked dejectedly at an old tire that leaned against the garage wall. 

“Look out!” Regina called. 

A wet clump of papier-mache landed at Todd’s feet with a plop. “You 
missed me!” he cried, ducking away. 

“So? Where’ve you been?” Regina asked. 

“Miss Grant kept me after school. She gave me a long lecture.” 

“About what?” Regina stopped to examine her work. 

“I don’t know. Something about running in school,” Todd replied. “How are 
you going to get this dumb bird to the science fair?” 

“Carry it,” Regina answered without hesitating. “It’s big, but it’s really 
light. I don’t suppose you would help Beth and me?” 

“I don’t suppose,” Todd told her, wrapping his hand around the broomstick 
that formed one bird leg. 

“Hey—get your paws off!” Regina cried. “Leave it alone!” 



Todd obediendy backed away. 

“You’re just jealous because Christopher Robin is going to win the 
computer,” Regina said. 

“Listen, Reggie—you’ve got to tell me what Patrick MacKay is doing for 
his worm project,” Todd pleaded. “You’ve got to.” 

She climbed down off the ladder. She saw the big worm in Todd’s hand. 
“What’s that for?” she demanded. 

“Nothing.” Todd’s cheeks turned pink. 

“You planned to drop that down my back, didn’t you?” Regina accused 

him. 

“No. I was just taking it for a walk,” Todd told her. He laughed. 

“You’re a creep,” Regina said, shaking her head. “Don’t you ever get tired 
of those dumb worms?” 

“No,” Todd replied. “So tell me. What’s Patrick’s project?” 

“You want to hear the truth?” Regina asked. 

“Yeah.” 

“The truth is, I don’t know,” his sister confessed. “I really don’t know what 
he’s doing.” 

Todd stared hard at her for a long moment. “You really don’t?” 

She crossed her heart. “I really don’t know.” 

Todd suddenly had an idea. “Where does he live?” he asked eagerly. 

The question caught Regina by surprise. “Why?” 

“Danny and I can go over there tonight,” Todd said. “And I’ll ask him what 
he’s doing.” 

“You’re going to go to his house?” Regina asked. 

“I’ve got to find out!” Todd exclaimed. “I’ve worked so hard on my worm 
house, Reggie. I don’t want Patrick the Copycat to do something better.” 

Regina eyed her brother thoughtfully. “And what will you do for me if I tell 
you where he lives?” 

A grin spread over Todd’s face. He held up the worm. “If you tell me, I 
won’t put this down your back.” 

“Ha-ha,” Regina replied, rolling her eyes. “You’re a real pal, Todd.” 

“Tell me!” he insisted eagerly, grabbing her by the shoulders. 

“Okay, okay. Don’t have a cow. Patrick lives on Glen Cove,” Regina 
replied. “I think the number is 100. It’s a huge, old mansion. Behind a tall 
fence.” 



“Thanks!” Todd said. “Thanks a lot!” 

Then, as Regina bent down to pick up the globs of papier-mache from the 
garage floor, he dropped the worm down the back of her T-shirt.

“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Danny complained. “My parents said I 
couldn’t come over. As soon as they went grocery shopping, I ducked out. But if 
they catch me...” His voice trailed off. 

“We’ll be back home in fifteen minutes,” Todd said. He shifted gears and 
pedaled the bike harder. Danny’s old bike splashed through a deep puddle at the 
curb. 

The rain clouds had rolled away. But the wind still gusted, cool and damp. 
The sun had set about an hour before. Now a thin sliver of moon hung low in the 
evening sky. 

“Where is the house? On Glen Cove?” Danny asked, out of breath. 

Todd nodded. He shifted gears again. He liked shifting back and forth. It 
was a new bike, and he still hadn’t gotten used to so many gears. 

A car rolled toward them rapidly, the glare of its white headlights forcing 
them to shield their eyes. Danny’s bike rolled up onto the curb, and he nearly 
toppled over. “Why’d they have their brights on?” he griped. 

“Beats me,” Todd replied. 

They turned sharply onto Glen Cove. It was a wide street of old houses set 
back on broad, sloping lawns. The houses were set far apart, separated by dark 
wooded areas. 

“No streetlights,” Danny commented. “You’d think rich people could afford 
streetlights.” 

“Maybe they like it dark,” Todd replied thoughtfully. “You know. It helps 
keep people away.” 

“It’s kind of creepy here,” Danny said softly, leaning over his handlebars. 

“Don’t be a wimp. Look for 100,” Todd said sharply. “That’s Patrick’s 
address.” 

“Wow. Check out that house!” Danny said, slowing down and pointing. “It 
looks like a castle!” 

“I think 100 must be on the next block,” Todd called, eagerly pedaling 
ahead. 

“What are we going to say to Patrick?” Danny asked, breathing hard, 
struggling to catch up. 



“I’m just going to ask him if we can see his worm project,” Todd replied, 
his eyes searching the darkness for address signs. “Maybe I’ll act like I want to 
help him out. You know. Give him a few tips on how to take care of the worms.” 

“Nice guy,” Danny teased. He chuckled to himself. “What if Patrick says 

no?” 

Todd didn’t reply. He hadn’t thought of that. 

He squeezed the hand brake. “Look.” He pointed to an enormous house 
behind a tall iron fence. “That’s his house.” 

Danny’s brakes squealed as he brought his bike to a stop. He lowered his 
feet to the wet pavement. “Wow.” 

The house rose up over the broad, tree-filled lawn, black against the purple 
night sky. It was completely dark. Not a light on anywhere. 

“No one home,” Danny said, whispering. 

“Good,” Todd replied. “This is even better. Maybe we can look down in the 
basement window or find the window to Patrick’s room, and see what he’s 
working on.” 

“Maybe,” Danny replied reluctantly. 

Todd glanced around. Patrick’s house was the only one on the block. And it 
was surrounded by woods. 

Both boys climbed off their bikes and started to walk them to the driveway. 

“I can’t believe Patrick would live in such a wreck of a place,” Todd said, 
pulling off his cap and scratching his hair. “I mean, this house is a real dump.” 

“Maybe his parents are weird or something,” Danny suggested as they 
parked their bikes. 

“Maybe,” Todd replied thoughtfully. 

“Sometimes rich people get a little weird,” Danny said, climbing on to the 
porch and ringing the doorbell. 

“How would you know?” Todd said, snickering. He pulled his cap back 
down over his dark hair and rang the bell again. “No answer. Let’s check out the 
back,” he said, hopping off the porch. 

“What for?” Danny demanded. 

“Let’s just look in the windows,” Todd urged, moving along to the side of 
the house. “Let’s see if we can see anything at all.” 

As they turned the corner, it grew even darker. The pale sliver of moonlight 
was reflected in one of the upstairs windows. The only light. 

“This is dumb,” Danny complained. “It’s too dark to see anything inside the 



house. And, besides—” 

He stopped. 

“Now what’s wrong?” Todd demanded impatiently. 

“Didn’t you hear it? I heard it again,” Danny said. “Like a growl. Some 
kind of animal growl.” 

Todd didn’t hear the growl. 

But he saw something enormous running toward them. 

He saw the evil red glow of its eyes—unblinking eyes trained on him. 

And he knew it was too late to escape.

“Run!” Danny screamed. 

But Todd couldn’t move. 

As the enormous red-eyed monster bounded toward them, Todd pressed his 
back against a side door. 

He nearly fell as the door swung in. 

The creature uttered an ugly, threatening growl. Its huge paws thundered 
over the ground. 

“Inside!” Todd screamed. “Danny—get in the house!” 

His heart pounding as loudly as the monster’s paws, Todd scrambled into 
the dark house. Danny lurched in behind him, uttering low gasps. 

Todd slammed the door shut as the creature attacked. 

Its paws struck the windowpane in the door, making the entire door rattle. 

“It’s a dog!” Todd cried in a choked whisper. “A huge, angry dog!” 

The dog let out another ferocious growl and leaped at the door. Its paws 
scraped over the window. 

“A dog?” Danny exclaimed shrilly. “I thought it was a gorilla !” 

The two boys pressed their shoulders against the door, holding it shut. They 
peered out warily at the big creature. 

The dog had sat back on its haunches. It stared in at them, its red eyes 
glowing. It was panting loudly, its enormous tongue hanging out of its mouth. 

“Someone should put that guy on a diet!” Danny exclaimed. 

“We could ride that dog to school!” Todd added. 

“How do we get out of here?” Danny asked, turning away from the dog. His 
eyes searched the dark room. 

“He’ll go away,” Todd said. He swallowed hard. “Probably.” 

“This place is a dump,” Danny said, stepping into the room. 

Todd turned to follow Danny. They were in the kitchen, he saw. Pale 
moonlight floated in through the window. Even in this dim light, Todd could see 
that something was terribly wrong. 

The kitchen counters were bare and covered in dust. There were no 
appliances—no toaster, no microwave, no refrigerator. There were no dishes or 



pots and pans in view. Glancing down, Todd saw that the sink was caked with 
thick dirt. 

“Weird,” Danny muttered. 

The two boys made their way through a short hallway to the dining room. 

“Where’s the furniture?” Danny asked, gazing in all directions. 

The room was empty. 

“Maybe they’re redecorating or something,” Todd guessed. 

“This doesn’t make sense. Patrick’s family is rich,” Danny said, shaking his 
head. “You know how neat Patrick is. He gets upset if his shirt comes untucked.” 

“I don’t get it,” Todd replied. “Where do you think he has his worm 
project?” 

The two boys made their way toward the living room. Their sneakers 
scraped over the dusty, bare floor. 

“Something is weird here,” Danny murmured. “Something is very weird.” 

They both gasped as they stepped into the living room—and saw the figure 
hunched at the window. 

Saw the decayed green flesh of his face. 

Saw the bones of his jaw, open in a hideous toothless grin. 

Saw his evil, sunken eyes staring across the room at them.

The heavy silence was broken by the shrill screams of the two boys. 

“Go! Go!” Todd cried. He shoved Danny toward the door and stumbled 
along behind him, keeping his hands on Danny’s shoulders. 

“Go! Go! Go!” 

Through the bare dining room. Across the dust-covered kitchen. 

“Go! Go!” 

Todd grabbed the doorknob, pulled open the door, and they both burst out 
of the house. 

Had the dog left? 

Yes! 

“Let’s move/” Todd cried. 

But Danny needed no encouragement. He was already halfway down the 
driveway, his chubby legs pumping hard, his hands stretched out in front of him 
as if trying to pull himself to safety. 

Out the gate. Onto their bikes. 

They pedaled furiously. Faster. Faster. Until their legs ached and they could 
barely breathe. And they never looked back. 

Who was that hideous, decayed figure in Patrick’s house? 

And why was the house so dusty, so totally bare? 

Todd spent most of the night lying awake in his bed, thinking about it. 

But the mystery wasn’t cleared up until the next morning. 

Yawning sleepily, Todd pulled on the same clothes he had worn the day 
before. Then he made his way down the hall to go to breakfast. 

He stopped outside Regina’s bedroom door when he heard her laughing. At 
first, he thought she was talking to herself. 

But then he realized that Regina was on the phone. 

So early? 

He pressed his ear to the door and listened. 

“Isn’t it a riot, Beth?” Regina was saying. “I sent them to the wrong 
address.” Regina laughed again. Gleeful laughter. 



Todd suddenly snapped wide awake. He pressed his ear tighter against the 
bedroom door. 

“Todd was so desperate, I couldn’t resist,” Regina was saying. “Know 
where I sent them?” 

There was a short pause. Todd realized he was holding his breath. He let it 
out silently and took another one, listening hard. 

“I sent them to the old Fosgate mansion,” Regina told Beth. She laughed. 
“Yeah. Right. That old deserted mansion where those kids had that Halloween 
party. Yeah. You know. They left that dummy with the weird mask in the 
window.” 

Another pause. 

Todd gritted his teeth as he listened to his sister’s triumphant laughter. He 
could feel every muscle in his body tightening in anger. 

“I don’t know, Beth. I haven’t talked to him yet,” Regina was saying. “I 
heard Todd come in last night. He ran straight to his room and shut the door. He 
was probably too scared to talk!” 

More laughter. 

Balling and unballing his fists, Todd stepped away from his sister’s door. 
He stopped at the stairs, feeling his face grow red-hot. He was thinking hard. 

So Reggie played a little joke on Danny and me, he thought bitterly. So she 
gave me the wrong address and sent us to that old haunted house. 

Ha-ha. Good joke. 

Todd felt so angry, he wanted to scream. 

Now Regina will be laughing at me about this forever, he realized. She will 
make fun of me for the rest of my life. 

Her bedroom door opened, and Regina stepped out into the hall. She was 
pulling her brown hair back into a ponytail. 

She stopped when she saw Todd at the top of the stairs. “So, how did it go 
last night?” she asked him, grinning. 

“Fine,” he replied casually. He gave her an innocent, wide-eyed stare. 

Her grin faded. “Did you go to Patrick’s house? Did you talk to him about 
his worm project?” she demanded, staring back at him, studying his face. 

Todd shook his head. “No. Danny and I decided to skip it. We just hung out 
at Danny’s,” he lied. 

Her dark eyes seemed to dim. She bit her lower lip. Todd could see how 
disappointed she was. 



He turned and made his way down the stairs, feeling a little better. 
You want to play jokes, Reggie? he thought. 

Okay. Fine. 

But now it’s my turn. My turn to play a mean joke. 

Todd smiled. He had already thought of a really good one.

Todd hoisted the cardboard carton in both hands. His worm house was packed 
carefully inside. It was heavier than he thought. 

“Where shall I put it?” he asked Mrs. Sanger, struggling to keep the heavy 
carton from slipping out of his hands. 

“What? I can’t hear you!” The science teacher held a clipboard in one hand. 
She cupped her other hand around her mouth as a megaphone. 

It was deafening in the gym as the kids all hurried to set up their science 
projects in time for the expo. Excited voices competed with scraping chairs and 
tables, the rattle of cartons being unpacked, and projects of all shapes and sizes 
being assembled and set up. 

“What a crowd!” Todd exclaimed. 

“I can’t hear you!” Mrs. Sanger shouted. She pointed to a long table against 
the wall. “I think your project goes there, Todd.” 

Todd started to say something. But he was interrupted by the crash of 
shattering glass and a girl’s loud scream. 

“Was that the acid?” Mrs. Sanger shouted, her eyes going wide with horror. 
“Was that the acid?” She pushed past Todd and went tearing across the gym, 
holding her clipboard in front of her like a shield. 

Todd watched a lot of kids gathering around the spot of the accident. Mrs. 
Sanger burst into the circle, and everyone began talking at once. 

Around the vast gym, others ignored the excitement and continued 
feverishly setting up their projects. 

The bleachers had been pulled down. Some parents and other kids from the 
school were already seated, waiting to watch the expo and the judging of 
projects. 

Groaning, Todd started to make his way through the crowded gym carrying 
the carton. He had to stop and chuckle when he caught a glimpse of Regina and 
Beth. 

They had their enormous robin set up close to the bleachers. The head was 
the right size now. They had managed to shave it down smoothly. 

But some of the tail feathers had gotten mashed. And they were working 
frantically to smooth them out. 



What losers, Todd thought, grinning. 

There’s no way they’re going to win the computer. 

Turning away, he glimpsed Danny’s balloon solar system hanging on the 
back wall. One of the balloons—the one closest to the sun—had already 
deflated. 

Pitiful, Todd thought, shaking his head. That’s just pitiful. 

He sighed. Poor Danny. I guess I should have let him share in my project. 

Todd lowered the carton onto the table reserved for him. 

“Ten minutes, everyone! Ten minutes!” Mrs. Sanger was shouting. 

No problem, Todd thought. 

He opened the carton and carefully lifted out the worm house. What a 
beauty! he thought proudly. 

It looked like a perfect little house. Todd had polished the wood frame until 
it glowed. And he had cleaned the glass until it was spotless. 

He set the worm house down carefully on the table and turned it so that the 
glass side faced the audience in the bleachers. He gazed into it. He could see the 
long, brown and purple worms crawling from room to room. 

He had packed the dirt in carefully. Then he had dropped in more than 
twenty worms before sealing it all up. 

It’s a real big family! he thought, grinning. 

Once the worm house was in place, Todd pulled out the sign he had made 
for it and placed the sign beside it on the table. 

He stepped back to admire his work. But someone pushed him gently aside. 

“Make room. Make room, Todd.” It was Mrs. Sanger. And to Todd’s 
surprise, she was helping Patrick MacKay carry a long cardboard carton to the 
table. 

“Move your project to the side, Todd,” the teacher instructed. “You have to 
share the table.” 

“Huh? Share?” Todd hesitated. 

“Hurry—please!” Mrs. Sanger pleaded. “Patrick’s box is heavy.” 

“I’m sharing the table with Patrick?” Todd couldn’t hide his unhappiness. 

Obediently, he slid his worm house to one side of the table. Then he stood 
behind the table, watching as Patrick and the teacher unloaded the long carton. 
The box was nearly six feet long. 

“Is that all one worm?” Todd joked. 

“Very funny,” Patrick muttered. He was straining hard to lift his project 



onto the table. 

“This will be our worm table,” Mrs. Sanger said, grabbing the end of the 
carton and tugging. Patrick pulled, too. 

Todd gasped as Patrick hoisted his project onto the tabletop. 

“Very impressive, Patrick,” Mrs. Sanger commented, straightening her 
skirt. She hurried off to help someone else. 

Todd gaped at the project. It towered over his. It was nearly six feet tall, 
taller than Patrick! 

“Oh, nooooo,” Todd moaned to himself. He turned to Patrick. “It—it 
isn’t... it can’t be—!” He choked on the words. 

Patrick was busily setting up his sign. He stepped back, checking it out, 
making sure it was straight. 

“Yes, it is!” he said, beaming at Todd. “It’s a worm skyscraper!” 

“Wow.” Todd didn’t want to show how upset he was. But he couldn’t help 
it. His legs were trembling. His mouth dropped open. And he started to stutter, 
“But—but—but—” 

I don’t believe this! Todd thought miserably. 

I built a crummy little worm house. And Patrick made a skyscraper! 

It’s not fair! Not fair! 

Patrick doesn’t even like worms! 

He stared at the giant wood-and-glass structure. He could see dozens and 
dozens of worms inside. They were crawling from floor to floor. There was even 
a wooden elevator with several worms tucked inside. 

“Todd—are you okay?” Patrick asked. 

“Yeah. Uh... fine,” Todd replied, trying to force his legs to stop quivering. 

“You look a little weird,” Patrick said, staring at Todd with his bright blue 

eyes. 

“Uh... that’s a nice project, Patrick,” Todd admitted through clenched teeth. 
“You could win the big prize.” 

“You think so?” Patrick replied, as if the thought had never occurred to him. 
“Thanks, Todd. I got the idea from you. About worms, I mean.” 

You stole the idea, you thief! Todd thought angrily. 

I have only one wish for you, Patrick. Go eat worms! 

“Wow! What’s that?” Danny’s voice broke into Todd’s ugly thoughts. He 
was staring in amazement at Patrick’s project. 

“It’s a worm skyscraper,” Patrick told him, beaming with pride. 



Danny admired it for a while. Then he turned to Todd. “Why didn’t you 
think of that?” he whispered. 

Todd gave Danny a hard shove. “Go blow up a balloon,” he muttered. 

Danny spun around angrily. “Don’t shove me—” 

Mrs. Sanger’s voice over the loudspeaker rose over the noise of the gym. 
“Places by your projects, everyone. The expo is starting. The judges will begin 
their rounds.” 

Danny hurried back to his balloon solar system against the wall. Todd 
watched him make his way past a display of rocks. Danny was swinging his 
arms as he walked, and he nearly knocked over all the rocks. 

Then Todd stepped behind the table. He brushed a speck of dust off the roof 
of his worm house. 

I should just toss it in the trash, he thought miserably. He glanced at Patrick, 
who stood beside him, grinning from ear to ear, his hands resting on the sides of 
his magnificent skyscraper. 

The copycat is going to win, Todd thought sadly. 

He sighed. Only one thing would cheer him up a little. One thing. And 
gazing across the gym, Todd saw that it was time for it to happen. 

The three judges—all teachers from another school—were stepping up to 
check out Christopher Robin. As they bent low to examine the papier-mache bird 
feet, Todd made his way quickly over to his sister’s project. 

He wanted a good view. 

One judge, a plump young woman in a bright yellow vest, examined the tail 
feathers. Another judge, a man with a shiny bald head, was questioning Regina 
and Beth. The third judge had her back to Todd. She was running her hand over 
the bird’s swelling orange breast. 

Reggie and Beth look really nervous, Todd thought, edging past a display 
on how trash gets recycled. 

Well, they should be nervous. What a dumb project. 

Todd stopped a few feet in front of the bleachers. There was a really big 
audience for the expo, he noticed. The bleachers were at least two-thirds filled. 
Mostly parents and younger brothers and sisters of the contestants. 

The bald judge kept making notes on a small pad as he questioned Regina 
and Beth. The other two judges were staring up at the giant robin’s beak. 

Todd edged closer. 

“What’s this string?” the judge in the yellow vest asked Beth. 



“Huh? String?” Beth reacted with surprise. She and Regina raised their eyes 
to the yellow beak. 

“What string?” Regina demanded. 

Too late. 

The judge in the yellow vest pulled the string. 

The beak lowered, revealing a surprise inside. 

“Ohhhh.” 

“Yuck!” 

Disgusted groans rose up from the audience. 

And Regina and Beth started to scream. 



11 


Fat worms wriggled out from inside the bird’s beak. 

Some of them wriggled out and rained down on the judges. 

A huge purple worm plopped onto the bald judge’s head. The angry judge’s 
red face darkened until it nearly matched the purple worm. 

Early that morning, Todd had packed about thirty worms in there. He was 
glad to see that most of them had stayed in the beak. 

People in the bleachers were groaning and moaning. “That’s sick!” 
someone yelled. 

“Gross! That’s so gross!” a little boy kept repeating. 

The judges were demanding to know if Regina and Beth had stuffed the 
worms up there as a joke. 

Mrs. Sanger was glaring angrily at them. The two girls were sputtering their 
apologies. 

It was a thrilling moment, Todd thought. A thrilling moment. 

About ten or fifteen worms were wriggling across the gym floor. Todd 
started to edge back to his table. 

“There he is! My brother!” he heard Regina shout. He glanced up to see her 
pointing furiously at him. “Todd did it! It had to be Todd!” 

He gave her an innocent shrug. “I thought Christopher Robin looked hungry 
—so I fed him!” he called. Then he hurried back to his worm house. 

A big grin on his handsome face, Patrick slapped Todd a high five. “Cool 
move, ace!” 

Todd grudgingly accepted the congratulations. He didn’t want to be friends 
with Patrick. He wanted Patrick to go eat worms. 

He glanced back at Danny. Danny was frantically blowing up a balloon. 
The rings had fallen off Saturn. And someone had accidentally popped Pluto. 

Todd smiled. He felt pretty good. His little joke had worked perfectly. 
Revenge was sweet. He had paid Regina back for sending him to that creepy old 
house. 

But his smile faded as he glanced at Patrick’s skyscraper and remembered 
that he was going to miss out on the grand prize. 

It took the school janitor a few minutes to round up all the worms. The 



crowd in the bleachers cheered him on as he scooped up the wiggling worms one 
by one and dropped them into an empty coffee can. 

After that, the expo continued calmly and quietly. The judges moved from 
project to project, asking questions, making notes. 

Todd took a deep breath when they approached his table. Don’t get excited, 
he warned himself. The worm house looks really puny next to the worm 
skyscraper. 

He had a sudden urge to bump the table, to shake it really hard. Maybe the 
skyscraper would topple over, and the house would be left standing. 

I could pretend it was just an accident, Todd thought. 

Evil thoughts. 

But he didn’t do it. 

The three judges spent about ten seconds looking at Todd’s project. They 
didn’t ask Todd a single question. 

Then they gazed at Patrick’s skyscraper for at least five minutes. “How did 
you get all those worms in there?” the bald judge asked. 

“I love the elevator!” 

“How many worms are there in total?” 

“Can worms survive in a real skyscraper?” 

“And what does this project prove about gravity?” 

Yak yak yak, Todd thought bitterly. 

He watched the judges coo and carry on over Patrick’s project. He wanted 
to grab all three of them and say, “He’s a copycat! I’m the real worm guy! I’m 
the one who likes worms!” 

But he just stood there grinding his teeth, tapping his fingers tensely on the 
tabletop. 

Still scribbling notes about Patrick’s project, the judges moved on to the 
next project—Liquids and Gases. 

Patrick turned to Todd and forced him into slapping another high five. “You 
can come over and see my new computer anytime,” Patrick whispered 
confidently. 

Todd forced a weak laugh. He turned away from Patrick—and found his 
sister glaring at him furiously from the other side of the table. 

“How could you, Todd!” she demanded, spitting out the words, her hands 
pressed tightly at her waist. “How could you do that to Beth and me?” 

“Easy,” he replied, unable to keep a grin off his face. 



“You ruined our project!” Regina cried. 

“I know,” Todd said, still grinning. “You deserved it.” 

Regina started to sputter. 

The loudspeaker above their heads crackled on. “Ladies and gentlemen, we 
have a winner!” Mrs. Sanger declared. 

The huge gym grew silent. No one moved. 

“The judges have a winner!” Mrs. Sanger repeated, her voice booming off 
the tile walls. “The grand-prize winner of this year’s Science Expo is...” 



12 


“The winner is...” Mrs. Sanger announced, “Danny Fletcher and his Balloon 
Solar System!” 

The audience in the bleachers was quiet for a moment, but then erupted in 
cheers and applause. Todd’s classmates on the floor applauded, too. 

Todd turned and caught the startled expression on Danny’s face. Several 
kids rushed forward to congratulate Danny. The balloons bobbed behind Danny 
as he grinned and took a funny bow. 

The gym erupted as everyone began to talk at once. Then the spectators 
made their way down from the bleachers and began wandering through the 
displays. 

I don’t believe this! Todd thought. Glancing at Patrick, he saw that Patrick 
felt the same way. 

Danny flashed Todd a thumbs-up sign. Todd returned it, shaking his head. 

He felt a hard shove on his shoulders. 

“Hey—” he cried out angrily and spun around. “Are you still here?” 

Regina glared at him angrily. “That’s for ruining our project!” she shouted. 

She shoved him again. “You apologize! ” she demanded furiously. 

He laughed. “No way!” 

She growled at him and raised her fists. “Go eat worms!” she screamed. 

Still laughing, he pulled off the wooden back of his worm house and lifted 
up a long, brown worm. He dangled it in front of his sister’s face. “Here. Have 
some dessert.” 

With a furious cry, Regina completely lost all control. 

She leaped at Todd, shoving him over backwards. 

He cried out as he sprawled back—and hit the table hard. 

Several kids let out startled screams as the enormous worm skyscraper 
tilted ... tilted... tilted.... 

“No!” Patrick screamed. He reached out both hands to stop it. 

And missed. 

And the heavy wood-and-glass structure toppled onto the next table with a 
deafening crash of shattered glass. 



“No!” a girl screamed. “That’s Liquids and Gases! Look out—it’s Liquids 
and Gases!” 

Dirt poured out of the broken skyscraper. Several worms came wriggling 
out onto the table. 

As Todd pulled himself to his feet, wild screams filled the gym. 

“Liquids and Gases!” 

“What’s that smoke?” 

“What did they break? Did they break a window?” 

“Liquids and Gases!” 

Thick, white smoke poured up from a broken glass bottle under the fallen 
skyscraper. 

“Everybody out!” someone yelled. “Everybody out! It’s going to blow up!” 



13 


No one was hurt in the explosion. 

Some strange gases escaped, and it smelled pretty weird in the gym for a 
while. 

A lot of worms went flying across the room. And there was a lot of broken 
glass to be cleaned up. 

But it was a minor explosion, Todd told his parents later. “Really. No big 
deal,” he said. “I’m sure everyone will forget all about it in five or ten years.” 

A few days later, carrying a small, white carton in both hands, Todd made his 
way down the basement stairs. He could hear the steady plonk plonk of Ping- 
Pong balls against paddles. 

Regina and Beth glanced up from their game as he entered the room. 
“Chinese food?” Beth asked, spotting the little box. 

“No. Worms,” Todd replied, crossing the room to his worm tank. 

“Are you still into worms?” Beth demanded, twirling her Ping-Pong paddle. 
“Even after what happened at the Science Expo?” 

“It all got cleaned up,” Todd snapped. “It was no big deal.” 

“Hah!” Regina cried scornfully. 

Todd gazed at his sister in surprise. “Hey, are you talking to me again?” 
Regina was so furious, she hadn’t said a word to him since the big disaster. 

“No. I am not talking to you,” Regina replied with a sneer. “I will never talk 
to you again.” 

“Give me a break!” Todd muttered. He opened the carton and poured the 
new worms into the big glass aquarium where he stored his collection. 

Plonk. Plonk. The girls returned to their game. 

“You know, what happened at the Science Expo was no tragedy,” Todd 
called to them. “Some people thought it was kind of funny.” He snickered. 

“Some people are kind of sick,” Beth muttered. 

Regina slammed the ball hard. It sailed into the net. “You ruined 
everything,” she accused Todd angrily. “You ruined the whole expo.” 

“And you ruined our project,” Beth added, reaching for the ball. “You made 
us look like total jerks.” 



“So?” Todd replied, laughing. 

The girls didn’t laugh. 

“I only did it because you sent Danny and me to that creepy old house,” 
Todd told them. He used a small trowel to soften the dirt in the worm tank. 

“Well, you wouldn’t have won, anyway,” Regina said, sneering. “Patrick’s 
skyscraper made your puny house look like a baby’s project.” 

“You’re jealous of Patrick—aren’t you, Todd!” Beth accused him. 

“Jealous of that copycat?” Todd cried. “He doesn’t know one end of a 
worm from another!” 

The girls started their game again. Beth took a wild swing and sent the ball 
sailing across the room. 

Todd caught it with his free hand. “Come here,” he said. “I’ll show you 
something cool.” 

“No way,” Regina replied nastily. 

“Just toss back the ball,” Beth said, holding up her hand to catch it. 

“Come here. This is really cool,” Todd insisted, grinning. 

He pulled a long worm out of the tank and held it up in the air. It wriggled 
and squirmed, trying to get free. 

Regina and Beth didn’t move away from the table. But he saw that they 
were watching him. 

Todd set the long worm down on the table and picked up a pocket knife. 
“You watching?” With one quick motion, he sliced the worm in half. 

“Yuck!” Beth cried, making a disgusted face. 

“You’re sick!” Regina declared. “You’re really sick, Todd.” 

“Watch!” Todd instmcted. 

All three of them stared at the tabletop as the two worm halves wriggled off 
in different directions. 

“See?” Todd cried, laughing. “Now there are two of them!” 

“Sick. Really sick,” his sister muttered. 

“That’s really gross, Todd,” Beth agreed, shaking her head. 

“But wouldn’t it be cool if people could do that?” Todd exclaimed. “You 
know. Your bottom half goes to school, and your top half stays home and 
watches TV!” 

“Hey! Look at that!” Regina cried suddenly. She pointed to the glass worm 

tank. 

“Huh? What?” Todd demanded, lowering his eyes to the worms. 



“Those worms—they were watching you!” Regina exclaimed. “See? 
They’re sort of staring at you.” 

“Get serious,” Todd muttered. But he saw that Regina was right. Three of 
the worms had their heads raised out of the dirt and seemed to be staring up at 
him. “You have a weird imagination,” Todd insisted. 

“No. They were watching,” Regina insisted excitedly. “I saw them watching 
you when you cut that worm in two.” 

“Worms can’t see!” Todd told them. “They weren’t watching me. That’s 
stupid! That’s—” 

“But they were!” Regina cried. 

“The worms are angry,” Beth added, glancing at Regina. “The worms don’t 
like to see their friend cut in half.” 

“Stop,” Todd pleaded. “Just give me a break, okay?” 

“The worms are going to get revenge, Todd,” Regina said. “They saw what 
you did. Now they’re planning their revenge.” 

Todd let out a scornful laugh. “You must think I’m as stupid as you are!” he 
declared. “There’s no way I’m going to fall for that. No way I’m going to 
believe such a stupid idea.” 

Giggling to each other, Regina and Beth returned to their Ping-Pong game. 

Todd dropped the two worm halves into the tank. To his surprise, four more 
worms had poked up out of the soft dirt. They were staring straight up at him. 

Todd stared down at them, thinking about what Regina and Beth had said. 

What a stupid idea, he thought. Those worms weren’t watching me. 

Or were they? 



14 


“Todd—rise and shine!” 

Todd blinked his eyes open. He sat up slowly in bed and stretched his arms 
over his head. 

“Rise and shine, Todd! Look alive!” his mother called from the foot of the 
stairs. 

Why does she say the same thing every morning? he wondered. Always 
“Rise and shine, rise and shine!” Why can’t she say, “Time to get up!” or, “Move 
’em on out!” or something? Just for a little variety. 

Grumpily, he pulled himself up and lowered his feet to the floor. 

Why can’t I have a clock radio like Regina? he asked himself. Then I could 
wake up to music instead of “Rise and shine!” 

“Look alive up there!” Mrs. Barstow called impatiently. 

“I’m up! I’m up, Mom!” Todd shouted hoarsely down to her. 

Bright sunlight poured in through the bedroom window. Squinting toward 
the window, he could see a patch of clear blue sky. 

Nice day, he thought. 

What day is it? he asked himself, standing up and stretching some more. 
Thursday? Yeah. Thursday. 

Good, he thought. We have gym on Thursday. Maybe we’ll play softball. 

Gym was Todd’s favorite class—especially on days they went outside. 

His pajama bottoms had become totally twisted. He straightened them as he 
made his way to the bathroom to brush his teeth. 

Are we having the math quiz today or tomorrow? he wondered, squinting at 
his sleepy face in the medicine chest mirror. I hope it’s tomorrow. I forgot to 
study for it last night. 

He stuck his tongue out at himself. 

He could hear Regina downstairs, arguing about something with their 
mother. Regina liked to argue in the morning. It was the way she got her mind 
into gear. 

She argued about what to wear. Or what she wanted for breakfast. One of 
her favorite arguments was whether or not it was too warm to wear a jacket. 

Todd’s mother never learned. She always argued back. So they had pretty 



noisy mornings. 

Todd liked to sleep as long as possible. Then he took his time getting 
dressed. That way, Regina was usually all finished with her arguing by the time 
he came downstairs. 

Thinking about the math quiz, he brushed his teeth. Then he returned to his 
room and pulled on a clean pair of faded jeans and a navy blue T-shirt that came 
down nearly to his knees. 

Regina and Mrs. Barstow were still arguing as Todd entered the kitchen. 
Regina, her dark hair tied back in a single braid, sat at the table, finishing her 
breakfast. Their mother, dressed for work, stood on the other side of the table, a 
steaming cup of coffee in one hand. 

“But I’m too hot in that jacket!” Regina was insisting. 

“Then why not wear a sweatshirt?” their mother suggested patiently. 

“I don’t have any,” Regina complained. 

“You have a whole drawerful!” Mrs. Barstow protested. 

“But I don’t like those!” Regina cried shrilly. 

Todd grabbed his glass of orange juice off the table and gulped it down in 
one long swallow. 

“Todd, sit down and have your breakfast,” his mother ordered. 

“Can’t. I’m late,” he said, wiping orange juice off his upper lip with one 
hand. “Got to go.” 

“But you haven’t brushed your hair!” Mrs. Barstow exclaimed. 

Regina, chewing on a piece of rye toast, laughed. “How can you tell?” 

Todd ignored her. “No need,” he told his mother. “I’m wearing my Raiders 
cap.” He glanced toward the hook on the hallway wall where he thought he had 
left it. Not there. 

“I can’t believe the school lets you wear your cap all day,” Mrs. Barstow 
murmured, refilling her coffee cup. 

“They don’t care,” Todd told her. 

“Only the real grunges wear caps,” Regina reported. 

“Is your brother a grunge?” their mother asked, raising her eyes over the 
white mug as she sipped coffee. 

“Has anyone seen my Raiders cap?” Todd asked quickly, before Regina 
could answer. 

“Isn’t it on the hook?” Mrs. Barstow asked, glancing toward the hall. 

Todd shook his head. “Maybe I left it upstairs.” He turned and hurried 



toward the front stairs. 

“Come back and eat your cereal! It’s getting soggy!” his mother called. 
Grabbing on to the banister, Todd took the stairs two at a time. Standing in 
the doorway to his room, his eyes searched the bed. The dressertop. 

No cap. 

He was halfway to the closet when he spotted it on the floor. I must have 
tossed it there before bed, he remembered. 

Bending down, he picked up the cap and slid it down over his hair. 

He knew at once that something was wrong. 

Something felt funny. 

As he bent the bill down the way he liked it, he felt something move in his 

hair. 

Something wet. 

It felt as if his hair had come to life and had started to crawl around under 
the cap. 

Moving quickly to the mirror over the dresser, Todd pulled the cap away— 
and stared in shock at the fat, brown worms wriggling through his hair. 



15 


Todd shook his head hard. A shudder of surprise. 

One of the worms toppled from his hair and slid down his forehead, 
dropping onto the dressertop. 

“I don’t believe this,” Todd muttered out loud. 

He tossed the cap to the floor. Then he reached up with both hands and 
carefully began untangling the worms from his hair. 

“Regina!” he screamed. “Regina—you’re going to pay for this!” 

He pulled three worms off his head, then picked up the fourth from the 
dresser. “Yuck.” He made a disgusted face into the mirror. His hair was damp 
and sticky where the worms had crawled. 

“Okay, Reggie! I’m coming!” he shouted as he barreled down the stairs, the 
worms dangling in one fist. 

She glanced up casually from the table as Todd burst into the kitchen. 

“Your cereal is really getting soggy,” his mother said from the sink. “You’d 
better—” She stopped when she saw the worms in Todd’s hand. 

“Very funny, Regina!” Todd exclaimed angrily. He shoved the fistful of 
worms under his sister’s nose. 

“Yuck! Get away!” she shrieked. 

“Todd—get those worms away from the table!” Mrs. Barstow demanded 
sharply. “What’s wrong with you? You know better than that!” 

“Don’t yell at me!” Todd screeched at his mother. “Yell at her!” He pointed 
furiously at his sister. 

“Me?” Regina’s eyes opened wide in innocence. “What did I do?” 

Todd let out an angry groan and turned to face his mother. “She stuffed 
worms in my cap!” he exclaimed, shaking the worms in Mrs. Barstow’s face. 

“Huh?” Regina cried furiously. “That’s a he!” 

Todd and Regina began screaming accusations at each other. 

Mrs. Barstow stepped between them. “Quiet—please!” she demanded. 
“Please!” 

“But—but—!” Todd sputtered. 

“Todd, you’re going to squeeze those poor worms to death!” Mrs. Barstow 
declared. “Go put them away in the basement. Then take a deep breath, count to 



ten, and come back.” 

Todd grumbled under his breath. But he obediently headed down to the 
basement. 

When he returned to the kitchen a minute later, Regina was still denying 
that she had loaded the cap with worms. She turned to Todd, a solemn 
expression on her face. “I swear, Todd,” she said, “it wasn’t me.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Todd muttered. “Then who else did it? Dad? Do you think 
Dad filled my cap with worms before he went to work?” 

The idea was so ridiculous, it made all three of them laugh. 

Mrs. Barstow put her hands on Todd’s shoulders and guided him into his 
seat at the table. “Cereal,” she said softly. “Eat your cereal. You’re going to be 
late.” 

“Leave my worms alone,” Todd told his sister in a low voice. He pulled the 
chair in and picked up the spoon. “I mean it, Reggie. I hate your stupid jokes. 
And I don’t like people messing with my worms.” 

Regina sighed wearily. “I don’t mess with your disgusting worms,” she shot 
back. “I told you—I didn’t do it.” 

“Let’s just drop it, okay?” Mrs. Barstow pleaded. “Look at the clock, guys.” 

“But why should she get away with that, Mom?” Todd demanded. “Why 
should she be allowed to—” 

“Because I didn’t do it!” Regina interrupted. 

“You had to do it!” Todd screamed. 

“I think you did it yourself,” Regina suggested with a sneer. “I think you 
stuffed worms in your own cap.” 

“Oh, that’s good! That’s good!” Todd cried sarcastically. “Why, Regina? 
Why would I do that?” 

“To get me in trouble,” Regina replied. 

Todd gaped at her, speechless. 

“You’re both going to be in trouble if you don’t drop this discussion—right 
now,” their mother insisted. 

“Okay. We’ll drop it,” Todd grumbled, glaring at his sister. 

He dipped the spoon into the cereal. “Totally soggy,” he muttered. “How 
am I supposed to—” 

Regina’s shrill scream cut off Todd’s complaint. 

He followed her horrified gaze down to his bowl—where he found a fat 
purple worm floating on top of the milk. 



16 


Todd tried to concentrate in school, but he kept thinking about the worms. 

Of course it had to be Regina who had put the worms in his cap and in his 
cereal bowl. 

But she had acted so shocked. And she said again and again that she didn’t 
know anything about them. 

Todd kept thinking about the afternoon in the basement. About cutting the 
worm in half. About the other worms watching him from their glass tank. 

“They saw what you did,” his sister had said in a low, frightened voice. 
“And now they’re planning their revenge.” 

That’s so stupid, Todd thought, pretending to read his social studies text. 

So stupid. 

But thinking about Regina’s words gave him a chill. 

And thinking about the worms waiting in his cap, crawling so wetly 
through his hair, made Todd feel a little sick. 

He told Danny all about it at lunch. 

They sat across from each other in the noisy lunchroom. Danny unpacked 
his lunch from the brown paper lunch bag and examined the sandwich. “Ham 
and cheese again,” he groaned. “Every day Mom gives me ham and cheese.” 

“Why don’t you ask for something else?” Todd suggested. 

“I don’t like anything else,” Danny replied, tearing open his bag of potato 
chips. 

Todd unpacked his lunch, too. But he left it untouched as he told Danny 
about the worms. 

Danny laughed at first. “Your sister is really a jerk,” he said through a 
mouthful of potato chips. 

“I guess you’re right,” Todd replied thoughtfully. “It’s got to be Regina. But 
she acted so surprised. I mean, she screamed when she saw the worm floating in 
the cereal.” 

“She probably practiced screaming all day yesterday,” Danny said, 
chomping into his sandwich. 

Todd unwrapped the tinfoil from his sandwich. Peanut butter and jelly. 
“Yeah. Maybe,” he said, frowning. 



“Come on, Todd,” Danny said, mustard dripping down his chin. “That 
worm tank of yours is really deep. The worms didn’t crawl out all by 
themselves. And they didn’t crawl upstairs to your room and then find your hat 
and crawl inside.” 

“You’re right. You’re right,” Todd said, still frowning thoughtfully. He 
pushed back his Raiders cap and scratched his brown hair. “But I just keep 
seeing those worms staring up at me, and—” 

“Worms don’t have eyes!” Danny declared. “And they don’t have faces. 
And, mainly, they don’t have brains!” 

Todd laughed. Danny was completely right, he realized. 

The idea of worms planning to get their revenge was just dumb. 

Feeling a lot better, he slid down in the chair and started his lunch. “Let’s 
talk about something else,” he said, taking a long drink from his box of juice. He 
raised his peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich to his mouth and took a big bite. 

“Did you see Dawkins fall off his chair this morning?” Danny asked, 
snickering. 

Todd grinned. “Yeah. Miss Grant jumped so high, her head nearly hit the 
ceiling! I thought she was going to drop her teeth!” 

“Luckily Dawkins landed on his head!” Danny exclaimed, wiping the 
mustard off his chin with the back of one hand. “Dawkins can’t stay on a chair. 
No balance, or something. Every day he—” 

Danny stopped when he saw the sick expression on Todd’s face. “Hey, 
Todd—what’s your problem?” 

“Th-this peanut butter sandwich,” Todd stammered. “It... tastes kind of 
strange.” 

“Huh?” Danny lowered his eyes to the half-eaten sandwich in Todd’s hand. 

Reluctantly, Todd pulled apart the two slices of bread. 

Both boys moaned in disgust and let out hoarse gagging sounds as they saw 
the half-eaten purple worm curled up in the peanut butter. 



17 


“Have you seen my sister?” Todd asked a group of kids at the door that led out to 
the playground. 

They all shook their heads no. 

After angrily tossing away his lunch, Todd had run out of the lunchroom in 
search of Regina. He had to let her know that her dumb joke had gone too far. 

Putting a worm in his peanut butter wasn’t the least bit funny. It was sick. 

As he ran through the halls, searching in each room for her, Todd could still 
taste the faintly sour flavor of the worm, could still feel its soft squishy body 
between his teeth. 

It made his teeth itch. It made him feel itchy all over. 

Regina, you’re not getting away with this! he thought bitterly. 

By the time he reached the end of the hallway, he felt so angry, he was 
seeing red. 

He pushed past the group of kids, opened the door, and burst outside. The 
bright afternoon sunlight made him lower his cap to shield his eyes. 

He searched the playground for his sister. 

Some kids from his class were playing a loud, frantic kickball game on the 
Softball diamond. Jerry Dawkins and a few other guys called to Todd to join the 
game. 

But he waved them off and kept running. He was in no mood for games. 

Regina—where are you? 

He circled the entire playground and teacher parking lot before he gave up. 
Then he slowly, unhappily trudged back toward the school building. 

His stomach growled and churned. 

He could picture the worm half wriggling around inside him. 

All around, kids were yelling and laughing and having fun. 

They didn’t eat worms for lunch, Todd thought bitterly. They don’t have a 
mean, vicious sister who tries to ruin their lives. 

He was nearly to the door, walking slowly, his head bowed, when he 
spotted Regina standing in the shade at the corner of the building. 

He stopped and watched her. She was talking to someone. Then she started 
to laugh. 



Keeping against the redbrick wall, Todd edged a little closer. He could see 
two others in the shade with Regina. 

Beth and Patrick. 

All three of them were laughing now. 

What was so funny? 

Todd could feel the rage boiling up in him. As he crept closer, trying to hear 
what they were saying, he balled his hands into tight, angry fists. 

Pressing against the building, Todd stopped and listened. 

Regina said something. He couldn’t make out the words. 

He took a step closer. Then one more. 

And he heard Beth laugh and say, “So Todd doesn’t know you’re doing it?” 

And then Patrick replied, “No. Todd doesn’t know. He doesn’t know I’m 
doing it.” 



18 


Stunned, Todd jammed his back against the brick wall. 

Patrick? 

How can Patrick be doing it? Todd wondered. 

That’s impossible! Unless... 

Todd couldn’t hold back any longer. He angrily stepped forward, feeling his 
face grow red-hot. 

The three of them turned in surprise. 

“So you’re doing it?” Todd cried to Patrick. “You’re giving my sister the 
worms?” 

“Huh? Worms?” Patrick’s mouth dropped open. He held a large sheet of 
construction paper in his hand. Todd saw him slip the sheet of paper behind his 
back. 

“Yeah. Worms,” Todd repeated, snarling the words. “I heard what you said, 
Patrick.” 

“Patrick isn’t giving me worms,” Regina broke in. “What is your problem, 
Todd? Why would I want worms?” 

“That’s where you’re getting them!” Todd insisted. “I heard you! I heard the 
whole thing!” 

The three of them exchanged bewildered glances. 

“I’m not into worms anymore,” Patrick said. “I tossed all my worms into 
my dad’s garden.” 

“Liar,” Todd accused in a low voice. 

“No. It’s true. I helped him,” Beth said. 

“I got bored with them. I don’t collect them anymore,” Patrick told him. 
“I’m into comic strips now.” 

“Huh? Comic strips?” Todd stared suspiciously at Patrick. 

The two girls began to grin. 

“Yeah. I’m drawing comic strips,” Patrick said. “I’m a pretty good artist.” 

He’s just trying to confuse me, Todd thought angrily. 

“Patrick—give me a break,” Todd muttered. “You’re a really bad liar. I 
heard what you were saying, and—” 



With a quick move, Todd reached out and grabbed the sheet of paper from 
behind Patrick’s back. 

“Hey—give that back!” Patrick reached for it. But Todd swung it out of his 
reach. 

“Huh? It’s a comic strip!” Todd exclaimed. He raised it closer to his face 
and started to read it. 

THE ADVENTURES OF TODD THE WORM 

That was the title in big, block, super-hero-type letters. 

And in the first panel, there stood a smiling worm. With wavy brown hair. 
Wearing a silver-and-black Raiders cap. 

“Todd the Worm?” Todd cried weakly, staring at the comic strip in 
disbelief. 

The three of them burst out laughing. 

“That’s what we were laughing about,” Regina told him, shaking her head. 
“Patrick can draw pretty well—can’t he?” 

Todd didn’t reply. He scowled at the comic strip. 

Todd the Worm. A worm in a Raiders cap. 

Patrick thinks he’s so funny, Todd thought bitterly. “Ha-ha. Remind me to 
laugh sometime,” he murmured sarcastically. He handed the sheet of paper back 
to Patrick. 

The bell on the side of the building rang loudly above their heads. Todd 
covered his ears. Everyone on the playground started running to the door. 

Beth and Regina jogged ahead of Todd. 

“So what about the worm in my sandwich?” he called to his sister, hurrying 
to catch up. He grabbed her by the shoulder and spun her around. “What about 
the worm?” 

“Todd—let go!” She spun out of his grasp. “What worm? Are you still 
carrying on about breakfast?” 

“No. Lunch,” Todd shouted furiously. “You know what I’m talking about, 
Reggie. Don’t pretend.” 

She shook her head. “No, I really don’t, Todd.” She turned to the door. 
“We’re going to be late.” 

“You put the worm in my sandwich!” he screamed, his eyes locked on hers. 

She made a disgusted face. “Yuck! In your sandwich?” She seemed really 



shocked. “That’s gross!” 

“Regina—” 

“You didn’t eat it, did you?” she asked, covering her mouth in horror. 

“Uh... no. No way!” Todd lied. 

“Ugh! I’m going to be sick!” Regina cried. She turned and, still covering 
her mouth, ran into the building. 

Todd stared after her. She seemed totally shocked, he realized. 

Is it possible that Regina didn’t do it? 

Is it possible? 

But then, if Regina didn’t do it —what does that mean ? 



19 


“Aren’t you sick of worms? Why are we digging up more worms?” Danny 
demanded. 

Todd dug his shovel into the soft mud behind second base. “I need more,” 
he murmured. He pulled up a long, brown one. It wriggled between his fingers. 
“Move the bucket over, Danny.” 

Danny obediently held the bucket closer. Todd dropped the worm into it and 
bent to dig up more. “My worms are all disappearing,” he said softly, 
concentrating on his work. “They’re escaping, I guess. So I need more.” 

“But they can’t escape,” Danny insisted. 

Todd dropped a short, fat one into the bucket. 

They both heard the rumbling sound at the same time. 

The ground behind second base trembled. 

Danny’s eyes grew wide with fright. “Todd—another earthquake?” 

Todd tilted his head as he listened. He dropped the shovel and placed both 
hands flat on the ground. “It—it’s shaking a little,” he reported. 

“We’ve got to go!” Danny cried, climbing to his feet. “We’ve got to tell 
someone.” 

“Nobody ever believes us,” Todd replied, not moving from the ground. 
“And, look—the rest of the playground doesn’t seem to be shaking at all.” 

The mud made a soft cracking sound as it trembled. 

Todd jumped to his feet and grabbed up the bucket. 

“Maybe we should find another place to get worms,” Danny suggested, 
backing away from the spot, his eyes on the shaking ground. 

“But this is the best spot!” Todd replied. 

“Maybe it’s a sinkhole!” Danny declared as they hurried off the playground. 
“Did you see that sinkhole on the news? A big hole just opened up in 
somebody’s back yard. And it grew bigger and bigger, and people fell in it and 
were swallowed up.” 

“Stop trying to scare me,” Todd told his friend. “I’ve got enough problems 
without worrying about sinkholes!” 


When he arrived at school on Friday morning, Todd found three worms 



wriggling around in his backpack. He calmly carried them out to the front of the 
school and deposited them in the dirt under the long hedge that lined the 
building. 

I’m going to stay calm, he decided. 

They’re only worms, after all. And I like worms. I collect worms. I’m a 
worm expert. 

He returned to the building, frowning fretfully. 

If I’m such an expert, he asked himself, why can’t I explain how the worms 
are following me everywhere? 

When he took out his math notebook an hour later, he found a mass of long 
purple worms crawling around near the binding and between the pages. 

The kids sitting near him saw them and started pointing and screaming. 

“Todd,” Mr. Hargrove, the math teacher, said sternly, “I think we saw 
enough of your worms at the Science Expo. I know you’re attached to them. But 
do you have to bring them to math class?” 

Everyone laughed. Todd could feel his face growing hot. 

“Todd’s saving them for lunch!” Danny exclaimed from two rows behind 

him. 

Everyone laughed even louder. 

Thanks a bunch, Danny, Todd thought angrily. He scooped the worms up, 
carried them to the window, and lowered them to the ground. 

Later, in the lunchroom, Todd unwrapped his sandwich carefully. Peanut 
butter and jelly again. 

Danny leaned across the table, staring hard at the sandwich. 

“Go ahead. Open it,” he murmured. 

Todd hesitated, gripping the sandwich in both hands. 

How many worms would be crawling through the peanut butter this time? 
Two? Three? Ten ? 

“Go ahead,” Danny urged. “What are you waiting for?” 

Todd took a deep breath and held it. Then he slowly pulled apart the two 
slices of bread. 



20 


“No worm!” Todd declared. 

Both boys let out long sighs of relief. 

Danny sank back into his seat and picked up what was left of his ham 
sandwich. 

Todd didn’t eat. He stared thoughtfully at the peanut butter covered with 
smears of grape jelly. “They’re going to drive me totally crazy,” he muttered. 

“What?” Danny asked with a mouthful of sandwich. 

“Nothing,” Todd replied. His head itched. He pulled off his cap and reached 
up to scratch it. He expected to find a worm in his hair. But there wasn’t one. 

Every time he opened his bookbag, he expected to find worms. Every time 
he ate a meal, he expected to see a worm bobbing or wriggling or crawling or 
swimming through his food. 

He was starting to imagine worms everywhere. Everywhere. 

Todd had dinner at Danny’s that night. Danny’s mother served fried chicken and 
mashed potatoes. Then she and Danny’s father argued all through dinner about 
where to go on their vacation, and whether or not they should save the money 
and buy a couch instead. 

Danny seemed really embarrassed about his parents’ loud arguing. 

But Todd didn’t mind it at all. He was so happy to relax and eat and not 
worry about finding any long, purple worms on his plate or in his glass. 

He and Danny went up to Danny’s room and played video games for a few 
hours after dinner. Danny had a game called Worm Attack. Todd made him bury 
it deep in the closet. 

Danny’s father drove Todd home at about ten. Todd’s parents were already 
dressed for bed. “Your mom and I both had rough days,” Mr. Barstow explained. 
“We’re hitting the sack early. You can stay up and watch TV or something if you 
want, Todd.” 

Todd didn’t feel sleepy. So he went into the den and turned on the TV. He 
watched a Star Trek that he’d already seen. 

He was yawning and feeling tired by the time the show went off at eleven. 
He turned off all the lights and made his way up to his room. 



He realized he was feeling really good, really relaxed. I haven’t thought 
about worms all night, he told himself happily. 

He climbed out of his clothes, tossing them onto the floor, and pulled on his 
pajamas. A warm, soft wind was fluttering the curtains at the window. He could 
see a pale half-moon in the black nighttime sky. 

Clicking off the bed table lamp, Todd pulled back his covers and slipped 
into bed. 

He yawned loudly and shut his eyes. 

Tomorrow is Saturday, he thought happily. No school. 

He turned onto his stomach and buried his face in the pillow. 

He felt something wet and warm wriggle against his cheek. 

Then he felt something moving under his chest. 

“Oh!” He jerked himself upright, pulling himself up with both hands. 

A long, wet worm clung to the side of his face. 

He reached up and pulled it off. 

He jumped out of bed. It took a short while to find the bed table lamp in the 
darkness. Finally, he managed to click it on. 

Blinking in the light, he saw a worm stuck to the front of his pajama shirt. 
Three long, brown worms were crawling on his sheet. Two more were stretched 
out on the pillow. 

“No! No! Stop!” 

It took Todd a while to realize that the shrill screams were coming from 

him\ 

“I can’t take it anymore!” he shrieked, losing control. 

He pulled the worm off his pajama shirt and tossed it onto the bed beside 
the others. 

“Regina! Regina—you’ve got to stop it! You’ve got to!” Todd screamed. 

He spun around when he heard footsteps at the bedroom door. 

“Mom!” Todd wailed. “Mom—look!” He pointed frantically to the worms 
crawling on his pillow and bedsheet. 

Mrs. Barstow raised both hands to her cheeks in surprise. 

“Mom—you’ve got to stop Regina!” Todd pleaded. “You’ve got to stop 
her! Look what she did! Look what she put in my bed!” 

Mrs. Barstow moved quickly into the room and put an arm around Todd’s 
trembling shoulders. “But Regina isn’t here, Todd,” she said gently. 

“Huh?” He gaped at her in shock. 



“Regina is at a sleepover at Beth’s,” his mother explained. “Regina isn’t 



21 


“We’ll have to have a long discussion about this in the morning,” Mrs. Barstow 
said, her arm still around Todd’s shoulders. “Maybe your worms are escaping 
from the tank somehow.” 

“Maybe,” Todd replied doubtfully. 

His mother lowered her eyes to the bed. “Yuck. Take the worms back 
downstairs, Todd, and I’ll change the sheets.” 

Todd obediently lifted the worms off the sheet and pillowcase. Two of them 
were mashed. But the rest were wriggling and squirming. 

They’re taking their revenge, Todd thought with a shudder as he carried 
them out of the room. 

Regina was right. 

The worms are paying me back. 

The worms dangled from his hand as he carried them down to the 
basement. He dropped them into the tank. Then he leaned over it, staring down 
into the soft, wet dirt. 

Most of the worms were below the surface. But a few crawled across the 

top. 

“Hey, guys,” Todd called down to them, lowering his face over the top of 
the glass aquarium. “Hey, guys—can you hear me?” 

He had never talked to his worms before. And he felt very uncomfortable 
talking to them now. 

But he was desperate. 

“Listen, guys, I’m really sorry,” Todd said, speaking softly. He didn’t want 
his voice to carry upstairs. If his mom or dad heard him talking to the worms, 
they’d know he was totally Looney Tunes. 

“I’m really sorry about what happened,” he told them. “I mean, about 
cutting that one in half. It will never happen again. I promise.” 

Leaning over the tank, he stared down into the dirt. The worms didn’t seem 
to be paying any attention to him. Two of them were crawling against one of the 
glass walls. Another was burrowing into the dirt. 

“So do you think you can stop following me around?” Todd continued, 
giving it one last try. “I mean, I don’t want to get rid of you all. I’ve been 



collecting worms for a long time. But if you keep this up, well... you’ll all have 
to go.” 

Todd lifted his head out and stood up straight. I can’t believe I just did that, 
he thought. 

Maybe I am totally nuts. 

He glanced quickly around the basement, expecting Regina and his parents 
to pop out from behind the furnace, crying, “April fool!” 

But no one else was down there. Luckily, no one had seen him actually 
pleading with the worms! 

Feeling really foolish and confused, Todd trudged back up to his room. His 
mother was waiting for him in the hall outside his room. “What took so long?” 

“Nothing,” Todd muttered, feeling himself blush. 

She swept a hand through his wavy, dark hair. “I never get to see your hair,” 
she said, smiling. “It’s always under that awful cap.” 

“Yeah. I know.” Todd yawned. 

“Go change your pajamas,” she instructed him. “Those have worm juice all 
over them. I’ll run you a hot bath.” 

“No. No bath,” Todd said sharply. “I’m too tired.” 

“You don’t want a bath after rolling around on worms?” Mrs. Barstow 
demanded. 

“Tomorrow. Okay?” he pleaded. 

“Okay,” she agreed. “But change your pajamas. Good night.” 

Todd watched her make her way downstairs. Then he returned to his room 
and changed into clean pajamas. He inspected the bed carefully, even though the 
sheets were new. Then he examined the pillow. 

When he was certain there were no worms, he turned off the light and 
slipped into bed. 

Lying on his back, he stared out the window at the pale half-moon—and 
thought about the worms. 

Regina was sleeping over at Beth’s—but the bed was full of worms. 

How? 

How were they wriggling into his backpack? Into his notebooks? Into his 
breakfast? His lunch? 

The room began to whirl. Todd felt dizzy. So sleepy. So very sleepy... 

But he couldn’t stop puzzling about the worms. Such a mystery. 

The night sky grew darker. The moon rose away from the window. 



It’s so late, Todd thought, and I can’t get to sleep. 

Maybe I do need a hot bath, he told himself, lowering his feet to the floor. 
Baths always relaxed him. 

He crept silently out of his room and down the hall to the bathroom. He 
didn’t want to wake his parents. Closing the bathroom door behind him, he 
clicked on the light. Then he turned on the water and filled the tub, making it 
nice and hot. 

When the water was nearly to the top, he pulled off his pajamas. Then he 
lowered himself into the steamy water. “Mmmmmm,” he hummed aloud as he 
settled into it. The hot water felt so good, so soothing. 

This was a good idea, he told himself, resting his head against the back of 
the tub. He smiled and shut his eyes. Just what I needed. 

A soft splash made Todd open his eyes and glance at the faucet. Had he 
forgotten to turn it off? 

Another splash. 

“Ohh.” Todd let out a soft moan as a fat purple worm slid out of the faucet 
and hit the water. “Oh, no!” 

Splash. 

Another worm dropped from the faucet. Then two more. They hit the 
surface of the water and plunged to the tub bottom just past Todd’s feet. 

“Hey—!” He pulled his feet away and drew himself up to a sitting position. 
“What’s going on?!” 

As Todd stared in horror, brown and purple worms tumbled from the faucet, 
three and four at a time, splashing into the tub. He raised his eyes to see more 
worms—sliding down the tile wall, plopping onto the water, onto his legs, onto 
his shoulders. 

“No—!” 

He struggled to climb out, trying to push himself to his feet with both 
hands. 

But the tub bottom was covered with wriggling, swimming, slithering 
worms. And his hands kept slipping out from under him. 

“Help—!” 

Breathing hard, he managed to climb to his knees. 

Worms clung to his back, his shoulders. He could feel them crawling over 
his hot, wet skin. 

More worms tumbled down the wall. They seemed to be raining from the 



ceiling. More and more poured out of the faucet. 

They had turned the entire tub into a seething, wriggling sea of brown and 
purple. 

“Help—somebody!” Todd shouted. 

But the worms were pulling him now. Pulling him down. 

He could feel their wet grasp, hundreds of tiny prickles, as they held him 
tightly and tugged him down, down, into the churning water. 

They plopped onto his head. Crawled over his face. Dangled from his 
quivering shoulders. 

Covered him. Covered him, and continued to rain down, to pour down, and 
pull him down with them, into the wriggling, dark sea of warm, wet worms. 



22 


“Please—help me! ” 

Todd struggled and squirmed. He twisted his body, trying to swing his arms 

free. 

But the worms held on, forcing him down, pulling him into the slimy, 
brown water. And more worms rained down, curling and uncurling as they slid 
down the wall, dropped from the ceiling, and poured from the faucet. 

“Oh!” 

He let out a startled cry as he tugged himself back to a sitting position. He 
thrashed his arms hard, sending a spray of water over the side of the tub. 

He blinked. Once. Twice. 

And the worms disappeared. All of them. 

“Huh?” His mouth dropped open as he gazed into the tub. The ceiling light 
reflected in the clear water. 

Hesitantly, he moved his toes. He splashed the water with both feet. 

Clear. Perfectly clear and clean. 

“Wow,” Todd murmured, shaking his head. “Wow.” 

The wriggling, tumbling worms lingered in his mind. Despite the heat of 
the bathwater, a cold shiver ran down his body. 

He climbed quickly out of the tub and wrapped a large, green bath towel 
around himself. 

A dream. It had all been a disgusting dream. 

He had fallen asleep in the bathtub and had dreamed up all of the worms. 

He shivered again. He still felt shaky. He could still feel the itchy pinpricks 
all over his body. 

Drying himself quickly, he let the towel slip to the floor and pulled on his 
pajamas. Then, as he hurried back to his room, eager to climb under the covers 
—he had an idea. 

He had an idea about how to solve the worm mystery. 

It was so simple, he realized. Such a simple plan. 

But it would tell him once and for all how the worms were escaping from 
their tank and getting into his things. 



“Yes!” he cried in an excited whisper. “Yes!” 

Finally, he had a plan. He knew exactly what to do. 

It will have to wait till Sunday night, he told himself, climbing into bed and 
pulling up the blankets. But I’ll be ready then. 

Ready for anything. 

Thinking about his plan, Todd fell asleep with a smile on his face. 

The weekend passed slowly. Todd and Danny went to a movie on Saturday. It 
was a comedy about space aliens trying to run a car wash. The aliens kept 
getting confused and washing themselves instead of the cars. In the end, they 
blew up the whole planet. 

Danny thought it was very funny. Todd thought it was dumb, but funny. 

On Sunday, Regina came home from Beth’s. The whole family drove 
upstate to visit some cousins. 

“It was a no-worms weekend,” Todd told Danny over the phone after dinner 
on Sunday evening. 

“Way to go!” Danny replied enthusiastically. 

“Not a single worm,” Todd told him, twisting the phone cord around his 
wrist. 

“So are you going ahead with your plan?” Danny demanded. 

“Yeah. Sure,” Todd said. “I have to. They just took the weekend off. For 
sure. Tomorrow is school. That means more worms in my backpack, in my 
books, in my lunch.” 

“Yuck,” Danny murmured on the other end of the line. 

“I’ve got to solve the mystery,” Todd told him. “I’ve got to.” 

“Well, good luck,” Danny said. “I’ll meet you tomorrow morning. Outside 
of Miss Grant’s class, okay? Get there early so you can tell me how it went.” 

“Okay,” Todd replied. “See you tomorrow.” As he hung up the phone, he 
felt excited and nervous and eager and frightened, all at the same time. 

He tried playing a Nintendo football game to pass the time. But he was so 
excited and nervous, he kept using the wrong fingers on the controller, and the 
machine beat him easily. 

Then he paced back and forth in his room, watching the clock slowly slide 
from number to number. 

At ten-thirty, he and Regina said good night to their parents and returned to 
their rooms. Todd changed into his pajamas, turned out the lights, then sat on the 



edge of his bed, waiting. 

Waiting for his parents to go to bed. 

He heard their door close at eleven-fifteen. Then he waited another fifteen 
minutes, sitting tensely in the dark, listening to the soft creaks and groans of the 
house, listening to the heavy silence. 

A little after eleven-thirty, Todd climbed out of his bed and tiptoed silently 
out of his room. 

It’s time, he told himself, creeping down the dark hall to the stairs. Time to 
get to the bottom of this. 

Time to solve the mystery of the worms. 



23 


The basement stairs creaked loudly under Todd’s bare feet. But there was 
nothing he could do about that. 

He tried to move as silently as a mouse. He didn’t want to alert anyone in 
his family that he was awake. He grabbed the wall and caught his balance as he 
started to stumble on the basement steps. 

Taking a deep breath, he stopped and listened. Had anyone heard him? 

Silence. 

The wooden steps were steep and rickety. But Todd couldn’t turn on the 
lights. He didn’t want anyone to see him. 

Not even the worms. 

A pale square of light spread across the basement floor, moonlight pouring 
through the narrow window up near the basement ceiling. Todd stepped around 
the light, keeping in the dark shadows. 

His heart pounded as he made his way slowly, carefully across the room. 
“Ow!” He let out a whispered cry as he banged his waist into the corner of the 
Ping-Pong table. He quickly covered his mouth before he could cry out again. 

The pain slowly faded. Rubbing his side, Todd picked up a tall stool and 
carried it over to one of the concrete beams that rose from floor to ceiling. 

He set the stool down slowly, carefully. Gazing around the beam, he could 
see the worm tank on its table. The glass tank reflected the glow of the 
moonlight that invaded the dark basement. 

Todd lifted himself silently onto the stool. Hidden behind the square 
concrete beam, he could watch the worms—but they couldn’t see him. 

He gripped his hands around the beam and steadied himself on the tall 
stool. Glancing up, he saw the high window, filled with moonlight, glow like 
silver. The light cast eerie shadows over the entire basement. 

Todd forced his breathing to slow to normal. 

Got to take it easy. It may be a long wait, he told himself. I may be sitting 
here, watching the worm tank all night. 

What did he expect to see? 

He wasn’t sure. But he knew something would happen. Something would 
happen to explain the mystery of the worms to him. 



Leaning against the beam, Todd stared at the glass aquarium tank. Were the 
worms plotting and planning inside? Were they deciding which ones of them 
would crawl upstairs and climb into Todd’s things? 

Todd suddenly imagined a different story. Glancing back at the silvery 
basement window, he imagined it opening. He imagined a dark figure sliding 
into the basement. Patrick. He imagined Patrick lowering himself onto the 
basement floor, then crossing the room to the worm tank. 

He imagined Patrick pulling up worms from the tank and sneaking upstairs 
with them. Todd could see Patrick grinning as he dropped the worms into Todd’s 
backpack, slipped one into the cornflakes box, hid one in Todd’s sneaker. 

It’s possible, Todd told himself, turning his attention back to the worms. It 
isn’t a totally crazy idea. It isn’t as crazy an idea as a bunch of worms planning 
their revenge.... 

He yawned, covering his mouth so the worms wouldn’t hear. 

How long will I have to sit here? he wondered. He felt a chill at the back of 
his neck. It was creepy down here in the dark. 

What were those soft skittering sounds? 

Mice? 

He didn’t have long to think about them. A loud creak behind him made 
Todd gasp. 

He gripped the concrete beam. 

The stairs began to groan. 

He heard the slow thud of footsteps. Footsteps growing louder, moving 
down the stairs. 

Todd lowered his feet to the floor. He pressed himself tightly behind the 
beam, trying to hide. 

The stairs creaked and groaned. 

The thud of footsteps stopped at the bottom of the steps. Todd squinted hard 
into the darkness. 

Who was it? Who was sneaking down to the basement? 

Who was sneaking down to the worm tank? 

Who? 



24 


Todd gasped as the ceiling lights flickered on. It took a second or two for his 
eyes to adjust to the bright fluorescent light. 

Then he saw the figure standing at the light switch. 

“Dad! ” Todd cried. 

Mr. Barstow jumped in surprise. He had a yellow bathrobe slung loosely 
around him. He carried one of Todd’s baseball bats in both hands, raised waist 
high. 

“Dad—what are you doing down here?” Todd cried shrilly. 

Todd’s father lowered the baseball bat. His mouth dropped open as he 
squinted across the room at Todd. “What are you doing down here?” he 
demanded. 

“I’m... uh... watching the worms,” Todd confessed. 

Mr. Barstow let the bat drop to the floor. It clanked noisily at his feet. He 
made his way quickly over to Todd, carefully stepping around the Ping-Pong 
table. 

“I heard the basement steps creaking,” he told Todd. “I heard a crash down 
here, someone banging into the Ping-Pong table. I—I thought it was a burglar. 
So I grabbed the bat and came down to investigate.” 

“It’s just me, Dad,” Todd said. “I had to find out how my worms are getting 
into my stuff. Sol decided to watch them all night and see if—” 

“I’ve had it with those worms!” Mr. Barstow exclaimed angrily. 

“But, Dad—” Todd protested. 

“What’s going on down there? Are you okay?” Mrs. Barstow called from 
the top of the stairs. 

“Everything is okay, dear!” Todd’s father called. “It’s just more worm 
trouble.” 

“Those disgusting worms again? Come up here and get back to bed,” Mrs. 
Barstow ordered. Todd could hear her padding back to her room. 

“Those worms are out of here tomorrow,” Mr. Barstow said sternly, 
tightening the belt of the yellow robe. 

“What?” Todd cried. “Dad, please—” 

“Enough is enough, Todd. I don’t understand what’s been going on with 



your worms,” his father said, frowning, resting his hands on his waist. “But I 
can’t have you scaring everyone in the house, sneaking around in the middle of 
the night, sitting in the dark, staring at a tank of worms instead of getting your 
sleep.” 

“But—but—” Todd sputtered. 

Mr. Barstow shook his head. “My mind is made up. No discussion. The 
worms go. Tomorrow afternoon, take them outside and dump them all in the 
garden.” 

“But, Dad—” 

Mr. Barstow raised a hand for silence. “I mean it. In the garden. Tomorrow 
afternoon. I’m sure you can find something better to collect than worms.” 

He placed both hands on Todd’s shoulders and marched him toward the 
stairs. 

Todd sighed unhappily, but didn’t say any more. He knew better than to 
argue with his father. When his dad made up his mind about something, he could 
be very stubborn. 

Todd climbed the rest of the way to his room in silence, feeling angry and 
disappointed. 

As he dropped onto his bed and jerked up the covers, he grumbled to 
himself about the most disappointing thing of all—he hadn’t solved the mystery. 

All that planning. All that sneaking around. 

He’d had such high hopes for getting to the bottom of it once and for all. 

But, no. 

Not only was he about to lose all of his worms, but now he would never 
know how the worms got into his things. 

I don’t care about those stupid worms! he told himself. I don’t care that I 
have to throw them all away! 

All I really care about is solving the mystery! 

Angry and frustrated, Todd turned and started to punch his pillow. Hard. 
With both fists. Again. Again. 

He didn’t realize that the whole mystery would be solved—accidentally— 
just a few hours later. 



25 


It rained the next morning. Todd didn’t even notice as he walked slowly to 
school. His thoughts were darker than the storm clouds over his head. 

He dropped his jacket in his locker and pulled out his Trapper-Keeper. 
Stuffing it into his rain-drenched backpack, he spotted Danny. 

As planned, Danny was waiting outside the classroom door. Waiting to hear 
how Todd had solved the worm mystery. 

Well, I guess Danny will just have to be disappointed, too, Todd thought 
glumly. He straightened his Raiders cap and, hoisting his wet backpack onto his 
shoulders, made his way across the hall to his friend. 

Danny’s red hair was soaked and matted down on his head. It looked more 
like a helmet than hair. 

Todd pushed his way through a group of laughing, shouting kids, all 
shaking rainwater off themselves, puddles on the hall floor at their feet. 

“So? How’d it go?” Danny asked eagerly as Todd stepped up to him. 

Todd started to tell his friend the bad news—but he stopped when he heard 
a voice he instantly recognized. 

Regina! 

Around the corner, out of view of the two boys, Regina and Beth were 
sharing a good laugh. 

“So he has to dump out all those gross worms today!” Regina was gleefully 
telling Beth. “Isn’t that awesome?” 

“Awesome!” Beth declared. 

Both girls laughed. 

“Todd is such a jerk!” Beth exclaimed. “Did he really think the worms were 
crawling upstairs on their own? Did he really think they were coming to get 
him?” 

“Yeah. I think he did!” Regina said through her scornful laughter. 

Around the corner from the two girls, Danny and Todd stood listening in 
shock. Neither of them moved a muscle. Todd’s mouth had dropped open. He 
could feel his face growing red-hot. 

“So today’s the last day?” Beth was saying. “Did you put any worms in his 
stuff today?” 



“Only two,” Regina replied. “Mom gave him a thermos of hot vegetable 
soup since it’s such a nasty day. I dropped one in the thermos. And I slipped one 
into his jacket pocket. He’s on his way to school. He probably stuck his hand in 
and found my little surprise.” 

Both girls laughed again. 

“And he never guessed it was you the whole time?” Beth asked Regina. 

“He guessed,” Regina replied. “But I’m such a good actress. I acted 
shocked and totally grossed out. Pretty soon, he didn’t know what to think!” 

They laughed some more. Then Todd heard them head the other way down 
the hall. 

He turned to find Danny staring at him. “Todd—do you believe it? It was 
your sister the whole time!” 

“I knew it,” Todd lied, trying to sound casual. “I knew it was Regina.” 

“Well, what are you going to do?” Danny demanded, still staring hard at 
Todd. 

“Get revenge, of course,” Todd replied quickly. 

“Revenge? How?” his friend asked. 

“I’m not sure,” Todd told him. “I just know it’s going to take a lot of 
worms! ” 



26 


The rain stopped after lunch. The heavy, dark clouds drifted away, and bright 
sunshine poured down from a clear blue sky. 

Todd eagerly watched the weather change through the classroom windows. 
The sunshine filled him with hope. 

This means the worms will be coming up from the ground, he thought 
happily. Dozens and dozens of worms. 

He was desperate to get out and collect them. He was going to need a ton of 
worms to pay his sister back for her mean joke. 

Unfortunately, just before school let out, he and Danny were caught having 
a glue fight during art class. Ms. Travianti, the art teacher, made them both stay 
after school and clean up all the paintbrushes. 

It was nearly four o’clock when Todd led the way to his favorite worm¬ 
collecting spot behind second base of the softball diamond. The playground was 
deserted. There were no other kids in sight. 

Todd and Danny both carried empty coffee cans they had borrowed from 
the art room. Without saying a word, they bent down and set to work, pulling up 
long, brown and purple worms, and dropping them into the cans. 

“How many do we need?” Danny asked, poking in the soft mud till he 
found a big wet one. 

“As many as we can get,” Todd replied. He still hadn’t figured out exactly 
what he was going to do to Regina. He just knew it was going to be totally 
awesome. And gross. 

“You really should pay back Beth, too,” Danny suggested. He dug a hole 
with his chubby hand and discovered three big worms tangled together. 

“Yeah. You’re right,” Todd agreed. “We’ll save a bunch for Beth.” 

Todd stood up and pulled off his jacket. Even though it was late afternoon, 
the sun still beamed down. He was already sweating. 

“Look at this one!” Danny declared. He held up a stubby pink worm. 

“It’s just a baby,” Todd said. “Toss it in the can, anyway. I need as many as 
I can get. Big or little.” 

Danny dropped the stubby pink worm in with the others. 

Todd pulled up a really long one. He carefully brushed clumps of mud off it 



before dropping it in the can. “The rain always brings up the really big ones,” he 
told Danny. 

The ground rumbled. 

At first Todd didn’t notice. 

“Did you feel that?” Danny asked. 

“Feel what?” 

The ground shook again. 

Todd heard a low rumbling sound, like distant thunder. 

“Hey—!” Danny cried, alarmed. He stopped digging. 

“That always happens,” Todd told him. “No big deal. Keep digging.” 

Danny dug his hand back into the mud. But he jerked it out quickly when 
the ground shook again, harder this time. “Hey—why is this happening again?” 
he cried. 

“I told you. It’s nothing,” Todd insisted. 

But then a loud roar made them both cry out. 

The entire playground seemed to tremble. The roar grew louder, closer. 

The ground shook. Then both boys heard a cracking sound. 

Todd started to his feet. But the ground shook so hard, he tumbled back 
down to his knees. 

Craaaaaack. 

“Oh, no!” Danny cried. 

They both saw the dirt pull apart between them. It looked like a dark wound 
opening up. 

Another rumble. The ground quivered and shook. The mud split open. 
Wider. 

Wider. 

And something poked up from under the ground. 

At first, Todd thought it was a tree trunk. 

It was dark brown like a tree trunk. And round like a tree trunk. 

But it was moving too fast to be a tree, rising up from the opening in the 

mud. 

And as the ground shook and the rumbling rose to a roar, Todd and Danny 
both realized that they were gaping in horror at a giant worm. 

A worm as thick as a tree trunk. 

Up, up it stretched, up from the mud, darting and dipping its enormous 
head. 



Todd uttered a shriek of terror, and turned to run. 

But his feet slipped on the wet, quivering mud. He fell forward, landing 
hard on his knees and elbows. 

And before he could pull himself up, the enormous worm swung around 
him, swung around his waist, circled him, pulled itself tight. 

“Ohhh!” he uttered a cry of panic. 

A crazy thought burst into Todd’s head: This is the mother worm. She’s 
come up to protect her babies. 

And then another crazy thought: The worms are really getting their revenge 
this time! 

And then he had no more time for crazy thoughts. Or any other kinds of 
thoughts. 

Because the enormous worm was tightening itself around Todd’s waist, 
choking off his breath, choking him, choking him. 

Pulling him. Tugging him down into the mud, down into its cavernous hole. 

He tried to call for help. 

But no sound came out of his mouth. 

He couldn’t yell. He couldn’t breathe. 

The huge, wet worm was crushing him, crushing him as it pulled him down. 

And then a dark shadow rolled over Todd. And everything went black. 



27 


Danny grabbed Todd’s feet and tried to pull him free. 

But the worm had wrapped itself around Todd’s waist like a tight belt. 
Danny pulled Todd’s ankles. Pulled hard. 

But he couldn’t free his friend. 

And now the worm was disappearing back into the gaping hole in the mud, 
and taking Todd down with him. 

And suddenly they were all covered in shadow. 

“Huh?” Danny let out a startled gasp. 

And raised his eyes to see what caused the shadow. 

And saw the enormous robin bouncing along over the grass. 

“Hey!” he frantically called out. “Regina! Beth!” 

They were carrying the big papier-mache bird home from school. He 
couldn’t see their faces. They were hidden on the other side of the enormous 
robin. 

“Regina! Help us!” 

And then the bird’s shadow rolled over Danny and Todd. 

And the worm jerked straight up. And began to tremble. 

Did it see the shadow of the bird? 

It jerked straight up—and let go of Todd. 

Todd slid to the ground. And the quivering worm began to lower itself. 
Instantly, with a sickening sucking sound, it dove back into the mud. 

Gasping for breath, Todd scrambled away on all fours. 

The worm—it thinks Christopher Robin is a real bird! he realized. 

When he glanced back, the worm had vanished back under the ground. 

“Regina! Beth!” Todd and Danny shouted together. 

The two girls slowly lowered their science project to the ground. “What do 
you want? What are you two doing here?” Regina demanded, poking her head 
around from the other side of the enormous robin. 

“Did you see it?” Todd cried breathlessly. “Did you see the worm?” 

“It was so huge!” Danny added, pulling Todd to his feet. “It was as tall as a 
building!” 



“Ha-ha,” Beth said sarcastically. “You guys must think we’re really dumb.” 

“No way we’re going to believe you caught a giant worm!” Regina added, 
shaking her head. 

“You didn’t see it?” Todd cried weakly. “You really didn’t see it?” 

“We’re not making it up!” Danny shouted angrily. “It grabbed Todd. It was 
huge and brown and slimy! It was pulling Todd down.” 

“Give us a break,” Beth groaned. 

“Go eat worms,” Regina said. 

They hoisted up their giant robin and continued their slow trek toward the 
street. 

Todd watched the bird’s wide shadow roll over the grass. The shadow that 
had saved his life. 

Then he turned to Danny with a weary shrug. “Might as well go home,” he 
said softly. “I’m not sure I believe it myself.” 

Todd tossed all of his worms into the garden that afternoon. He told everyone he 
never wanted to see a worm again. 

When Danny came over to Todd’s house a few weeks later, he found Todd down 
in the basement, busy with a new hobby. “What are you doing?” Danny asked. 

Todd’s eyes remained on the fluttering creature inside the glass jar on the 
worktable. “I’m chloroforming this butterfly,” he told his friend. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” Danny asked. 

“I dipped a wad of cotton in chloroform and dropped it into the jar. It will 
kill the butterfly. Watch.” 

When the gold-and-black butterfly stopped fluttering, Todd carefully 
opened the jar. He lifted the butterfly out with long tweezers and gently spread 
its wings. Then he hung it on a board by sticking a long pin through its middle. 

“You’re collecting butterflies now?” Danny asked in surprise. 

Todd nodded. “Butterflies are so gentle, so pretty,” he said, concentrating 
on his work. 

“Todd has changed a lot,” Regina announced, appearing at the bottom of 
the stairs. “He isn’t into qross anymore. Now he’s into things that are soft and 
beautiful.” 

“Let me show you some of my most beautiful butterfly specimens,” Todd 
told Danny. “I have a few monarchs that will knock your eyes out.” 



Everyone was happy about Todd’s new hobby. Especially Regina. There were no 
more cruel practical jokes played in the Barstow house. 

Then, one night, Todd gazed up from his worktable—and uttered a horrified 
cry as he saw the big creature fluttering toward him. 

An enormous butterfly. 

As big as a bedsheet! 

Carrying an enormous silver pin. 

“What are you going to do?” Todd cried. 




GHOST BEACH 


Goosebumps - 22 
R.L. Stine

I don’t remember how we got to the graveyard. 

I remember the sky grew dark—and we were there. 

My sister Terri and I walked past rows of crooked, old tombstones, cracked 
and covered with moss. Even though it was summer, a damp, gray fog had 
settled on everything, sending a chill through the air. 

I shivered and pulled my jacket closer. “Wait up, Terri!” I called. As usual, 
she had plowed ahead. Graveyards get her all excited. “Where are you?” I 
yelled. 

I squinted into the gray fog. I could see her shadowy figure up ahead, 
stopping every few seconds to examine a tombstone. 

I read the words on the tombstone tilted at my feet: 

In memory of John, 
son of Daniel and Sarah Knapp, 
who died March 25,1766, 
aged 12 years and 22 days. 

Weird, I thought. That kid was about my age when he died. I turned twelve 
in February. The same month Terri turned eleven. 

I hurried on. A sharp wind swept in. I searched the rows of old graves for 
my sister. She had disappeared into the thick fog. “Terri? Where did you go?” I 
called. 

Her voice floated back to me. “I’m over here, Jerry.” 

“Where?” I pushed forward through the mist and the leaves. The wind 
swirled around me. 

From nearby came a long, low howl. “Must be a dog,” I murmured aloud. 

The trees rattled their leaves at me. I shivered. 

“Jer-ry.” Terri’s voice sounded a million miles away. 

I walked a little further, then steadied myself against a tall tombstone. 
“Terri! Wait up! Stop moving around so much!” 

I heard another long howl. 



“You’re going the wrong way,” Terri called. “I’m over here.” 

“Great. Thanks a lot,” I muttered. Why couldn’t I have a sister who liked 
baseball instead of exploring old cemeteries? 

The wind made a deep sucking noise. A column of leaves, dust, and dirt 
swirled up in my face. I pinched my eyes shut. 

When I opened them, I saw Terri crouched over a small grave. “Don’t 
move,” I called. “I’m coming.” 

I zigzagged my way around the tombstones until I reached her side. “It’s 
getting dark,” I said. “Let’s get out of here.” 

I turned and took a step—and something grabbed my ankle. 

I screamed and tried to pull away. But its grasp tightened. 

A hand. Reaching up through the dirt beside the grave. 

I let out a shrill scream. Terri screamed, too. 

I kicked hard and broke free. 

“Run!” Terri shrieked. 

But I was already running. 

As Terri and I stumbled over the wet grass, green hands popped up 
everywhere. Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Pop! Pop! 

The hands rose up. Reached for us. Grabbed at our ankles. 

I darted to the left. Thwack! I dodged to the right. Pop! 

“Run, Terri! Run!” I called to my sister. “Lift your knees!” 

I could hear her sneakers pounding the ground behind me. Then I heard her 
terrified cry: “Jerry! They’ve got me!” 

With a loud gasp, I spun around. Two big hands had wrapped themselves 
around her ankles. 

I froze, watching my sister struggle. 

“Jerry—help me! It won’t let go!” 

Taking a deep breath, I dove toward her. “Grab on to me,” I instructed, 
holding out my arms. 

I kicked at the two hands that held her. 

Kicked as hard as I could. But they didn’t move, didn’t let go. 

“I—I can’t move!” Terri wailed. 

The dirt seemed to shake at my feet. I peered down to see more hands 
sprouting up from the ground. 

I tugged at Terri’s waist. “Move!” I yelled frantically. 

“I can’t!” 



“Yes, you can! You’ve got to keep trying!” 

“Ohhh!” I let out a low cry as two hands grabbed my ankles. 
Now I was caught. 

We were both trapped.

“Jerry! What’s your problem?” Terri asked. 

I blinked. Terri stood beside me on a rocky strip of beach. I stared out at the 
calm ocean water beyond us and shook my head. “Wow. That was weird,” I 
murmured. “I was remembering a bad dream I had a few months ago.” 

Terri frowned at me. “Why now?” 

“It was about a cemetery,” I explained. I turned back to glance at the tiny, 
old cemetery we’d just discovered at the edge of the pine woods behind us. “In 
my dream, green hands were popping out of the ground and grabbing our 
ankles.” 

“Gross,” Terri replied. She brushed her dark brown bangs off her face. 
Except for the fact that she is one inch taller than me, we look like a perfect 
brother-sister combination. Same short brown hair, same freckles across our 
nose, same hazel eyes. 

One difference: Terri has deep dimples in her cheeks when she smiles, and I 
don’t. Thank goodness. 

We walked along the ocean shore for a few minutes. Tall, gray boulders and 
scraggly pines stretched all the way to the water. 

“Maybe you remembered that dream because you’re nervous,” Terri said 
thoughtfully. “You know. About being away from home for a whole month.” 

“Well, maybe,” I agreed. “We’ve never been away this long. But what could 
happen here? Brad and Agatha are really great.” 

Brad Sadler is our distant cousin. Ancient, distant cousin is more like it. 
Dad said Brad and his wife, Agatha, were old when he was a kid! 

But they’re both fun, and really energetic despite their age. So when they 
invited us to come up to New England and spend the last month of summer with 
them in their old cottage near the beach, Terri and I eagerly said yes. It sounded 
great—especially since our only other choice was the cramped, hot apartment 
where we live in New Jersey. 

We had arrived by train that morning. Brad and Agatha met us at the 
platform and drove us along the pine woods to the cottage. 

After we had a chance to unpack and have some lunch—big bowls of 
creamy clam chowder—Agatha said, “Now why don’t you kids have a look 



around? There’s lots to explore.” 

So here we were, checking things out. Terri grabbed my arm. “Hey, let’s go 
back and check out that little cemetery!” she suggested eagerly. 

“I don’t know...” My frightening dream was still fresh in my mind. 

“Oh, come on. There won’t be any green hands. I promise. And I bet I can 
find some really cool gravestones for rubbings.” 

Terri loves exploring old graveyards. She loves all kinds of scary things. 
She reads scary mysteries by the dozen. And the weird thing is, she always reads 
the last chapter first. 

Terri has to solve the mystery. She can’t stand not knowing the answer. 

My sister has a million interests, but gravestone mbbings is one of her 
stranger hobbies. She tapes a piece of rice paper over the gravestone inscription 
and then rubs the design onto the paper, using the side of a special wax crayon. 

“Hey! Wait up,” I called to her. 

But Terri was already jogging up the beach toward the cemetery. “Come on, 
Jerry,” she called. “Don’t be a chicken.” 

I followed her off the beach and into the small forest. It smelled fresh and 
piney. The cemetery was just inside, surrounded by a crumbly stone wall. We 
squeezed through the narrow opening in the wall that led inside. 

Terri began inspecting the tombstones. “Wow. Some of these markers are 
really old,” she announced. “Check out this one.” 

She pointed at a small gravestone. Engraved on the front was a skull with 
wings sprouting on either side of its head. 

“It’s a death’s-head,” my sister explained. “Very old Puritan symbol. 
Creepy, huh?” She read the inscription: “'Here lies the body of Mr. John Sadler, 
who departed this life March 18, 1642, in the 38th year of his age.’” 

“Sadler. Like us,” I said. “Wow. I wonder if we’re related.” I did some 
quick calculations. “If we are, John Sadler is our great-great-great-great- 
grandsomething. He died over 350 years ago.” 

Terri had already moved on to another group of markers. “Here’s one from 
1647, and another from 1652. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten rubbings this old 
before.” She disappeared behind a tall tombstone. 

I knew where we’d be spending the month. I’d had enough of cemeteries 
for today, though. 

“Come on. Let’s explore the beach, okay?” I checked around for Terri. 
“Terri? Where’d you go?” I stepped over to the tall tombstone. 



Not there. 

“Terri?” The ocean breeze rustled the pine branches above us. “Terri, cut it 
out, okay?” 

I took a couple of steps. “You know I don’t like this,” I warned. 

Terri’s head popped up from behind a tombstone about ten feet away. 
“Why? You scared?” 

I didn’t like the grin on her face. “Who, me?” I said. “Never!” 

Terri stood up. “Okay, chicken. But I’m coming back here tomorrow.” She 
followed me out of the cemetery and onto the rocky beach. 

“I wonder what’s down here,” I said, heading along the shoreline. 

“Oh, look at this.” Terri stooped to pluck a tiny yellow-and-white 
wildflower that had sprouted up between two large rocks. “Butter-and-eggs,” she 
announced. “Weird name for a wildflower, huh?” 

“Very,” I agreed. Terri Sadler Hobby Number Two: wildflowers. She likes 
to collect them and press them in a huge cardboard contraption called a plant 
press. 

Terri frowned. “Now what’s your problem?” 

“We keep stopping. I want to go exploring. Agatha said there’s a small 
beach down here where we can go swimming if we want.” 

“Okay, okay,” she replied, rolling her hazel eyes. 

We trudged on until we reached a small, sandy beach. It was really more 
rock than sand. Staring out to the water, I saw a long rock jetty stretching out 
into the ocean. 

“Wonder what that’s for,” Terri said. 

“It helps hold the beach together,” I explained. I was just about to launch 
into my explanation of beach erosion when Terri gasped. 

“Jerry—look! Up there!” she cried. She pointed to a tall mound of rocks 
just past the jetty along the shoreline. Nestled high into the rocks, on top of a 
wide ledge, sat a large, dark cave. 

“Let’s climb up and explore it,” Terri cried eagerly. 

“No, wait!” I remembered what Mom and Dad had said to me that morning 
as we boarded the train: Keep an eye on Terri and don’t let her get too carried 
away with things. “It might be dangerous,” I said. I am the older brother, after 
all. And I’m the sensible one. 

She made a face. “Give me a break,” she muttered. Terri made her way 
across the beach and toward the cave. “At least let’s get a closer look. We can 



ask Brad and Agatha later whether or not it’s safe.” 

I followed behind her. “Yeah, right. Like ninety-year-olds ever go cave 
exploring.” 

As we came nearer, I had to admit it was an awesome cave. I’d never seen 
one that large except in an old Boy Scout magazine. 

“I wonder if someone lives in it,” Terri said excitedly. “You know. Like a 
beach hermit.” She cupped her hands around her mouth and called: “Whooooo!” 

Sometimes Terri can be such a dork. I mean, if you were living inside a 
cave, and you heard someone go “whoooo,” would you answer back? 

“Whoooo!” My sister did it again. 

“Let’s go,” I urged. 

Then, from inside the cave, a long, low whistle pierced the air. 

We stared at each other. 

“Whoa! What was that?” Terri whispered. “An owl?” 

I swallowed. “I don’t think so. Owls are only awake at night.” 

We heard it again. A long whistle floating out from deep inside the cave. 

We exchanged glances. What could it be? A wolf? A coyote? 

“I bet Brad and Agatha are wondering where we are,” Terri said softly. 
“Maybe we should go.” 

“Yeah. Okay.” I turned to leave. But stopped when I heard a fluttering 
sound. From behind the cave. Growing louder. 

I shielded my eyes with my hand and squinted up at the sky. 

“No!” I grabbed Terri’s arm as a shadow swept over us—and an enormous 
bat swooped down at us, red eyes flashing, its pointed teeth glistening, hissing as 
it attacked. 



3 


The bat swooped low. So low, I could feel the air from its fluttering wings. 

Terri and I dropped to the hard ground. I covered my head with both hands. 

My heart was pounding so loudly, I couldn’t hear the fluttering wings. 

“Hey—where’d it go?” I heard Terri cry. 

I peeped out. I could see the bat spiralling up into the sky. I watched it 
swoosh and dip beyond us. Then suddenly it went into a wild spin. 

It crashed onto the rocks nearby. I could see one black wing flapping 
weakly in the breeze. 

Slowly, I climbed to my feet, my heart still thudding. “What made it drop 
like that?” I asked in a shaky voice. I started toward it. 

Terri held me back. “Stay away. Bats can carry rabies, you know.” 

“I’m not going to get that close,” I told her. “I just want to take a look. I’ve 
never seen a real bat close up.” I guess you could say that my hobby is science, 
too. I love studying about all kinds of animals. 

“Here. Check it out,” I announced, scrambling over the smooth, gray 
boulders. 

“Careful, Jerry,” warned Terri. “If you get rabies, you’ll get me in trouble.” 

“Thanks for your concern,” I muttered sarcastically. 

I stopped about four feet from the bat. “Whoa! I don’t believe it!” I cried. 

I heard Terri burst out laughing. 

It wasn’t a bat. It was a kite. 

I stared in disbelief. The two red eyes that had seemed so menacing were 
painted on paper! One of the wings had been ripped to shreds when it crashed on 
the rocks. 

We both bent over to examine the wreckage. 

“Look out! It bites!” a boy’s voice called from behind us. 

Startled, Terri and I leaped back. I turned and saw a boy about our age, 
standing on a tall rock. He had a ball of string in his hand. 

“Ha-ha. Great joke,” Terri said sarcastically. 

The boy grinned at us, but didn’t reply. He stepped closer. I could see that 
he had freckles across his nose just like me, and brown hair the same shade as 



mine. He turned back toward the rocks and called, “You can come out now.” 

Two kids, a girl about our age and a little boy about five, clambered over 
the rocks. The little boy had light blond hair and blue eyes, and his ears poked 
out. The girl’s hair was auburn, and she wore it in braids. A11 three of them had 
the same freckles across their noses. 

“Are you all in the same family?” Terri asked them. 

The tallest boy, the one who had come out first, nodded his head. “Yeah. 
We’re all Sadlers. I’m Sam. That’s Louisa. That’s Nat.” 

“Wow,” I said. “We’re Sadlers, too.” I introduced Terri and myself. 

Sam didn’t seem impressed. “There’re lots of Sadlers around here,” he 
muttered. 

We stared at each other for a long moment. They didn’t seem very friendly. 
But then Sam surprised me by asking if I wanted to skip rocks in the water. 

We followed Sam to the water’s edge. 

“Do you live around here?” Terri asked. 

Louisa nodded. “What are you doing here?” she asked. She sounded 
suspicious. 

“We’re visiting our cousins for the month,” Terri told her. “They’re Sadlers, 
too. They live in the little cottage just past the lighthouse. Do you know them?” 

“Sure,” said Louisa without smiling. “This is a small place. Everyone 
knows everyone else.” 

I found a smooth, flat stone and skipped it across the water. Three skips. 
Not bad. “What do you do for fun around here?” I asked. 

Louisa replied, staring out at the water. “We go blueberry picking, we play 
games, we come down to the water.” She turned to me. “Why? What did you do 
today?” 

“Nothing yet. We just got here,” I told her. I grinned. “Except we were 
attacked by a bat kite.” 

They laughed. 

“I’m going to do gravestone rubbings and collect wildflowers,” Terri said. 

“There are some beautiful flower patches back in the woods,” Louisa told 
her. 

I watched Sam skip a stone across the water. Seven skips. 

He turned to me and grinned. “Practice makes perfect.” 

“It’s hard to practice in an apartment building,” I muttered. 

“Huh?” Sam said. 



“We live in Hoboken,” I explained. “In New Jersey. There aren’t any ponds 
in our building.” 

Terri pointed back at the cave. “Do you ever go exploring in there?” she 
asked. 

Nat gasped. Sam and Louisa’s faces twisted in surprise. “Are you kidding?” 
Louisa cried. 

“We never go near there,” Sam said softly, eyeing his sister. 

“Never?” Terri asked. 

All three of them shook their heads. 

“Why not?” Terri asked. “What’s the big deal?” 

“Yeah,” I demanded. “Why won’t you go near the cave?” 

Louisa’s eyes grew wide. “Do you believe in ghosts?” she asked. 



4 


“Believe in ghosts? No way!” Terri told her. 

I kept my mouth shut. I knew that ghosts weren’t supposed to be real. But 
what if all the scientists were wrong? 

There are so many ghost stories from all around the world, how can ghosts 
not be real? 

Maybe that’s why I sometimes get scared when I am in strange places. I 
think I do believe in ghosts. Of course, I would never admit this to Terri. She is 
always so scientific. She’d laugh at me forever! 

The three Sadler kids had clustered together. 

“Come on. Do you guys really believe in ghosts?” Terri asked. 

Louisa took a step forward. Sam tried to pull her back, but she brushed him 
off. “If you go near that cave, you might change your mind,” she said, narrowing 
her eyes. 

“You mean there are ghosts in there?” I asked. 

“What do they do? Come out at night or something?” 

Louisa started to reply, but Sam interrupted. “We’ve got to go now,” he 
said, scooting his brother and sister past us. 

“Hey—wait!” I called. “We want to hear about the ghosts!” 

They hurried on. I could see Sam yelling angrily at Louisa. I guess he was 
upset because she mentioned the ghosts. 

They disappeared down the beach. 

Then, from inside the cave we heard that long, low whistle again. 

Terri stared at me. 

“It’s the wind,” I said. I really didn’t believe that. Terri didn’t believe it, 
either. 

“Why don’t we ask Brad and Agatha about the cave?” I suggested. 

“Good idea,” Terri said. Even she looked a little scared now.. 

Brad and Agatha’s cottage was a short walk from the cave. It perched by 
itself on the edge of the pine forest, looking out toward the lighthouse. 

I ran up to the heavy wooden front door and pushed it open. I peered around 
the tiny front parlor. The old house creaked and groaned as I walked over the 
sagging floorboards. The ceiling hung so low, I could touch it when I stood on 



tiptoe. 

Terri came up beside me. “Are they here?” 

“I don’t think so,” I answered, looking around. 

We stepped past the old sofa and wide stone fireplace and into the cramped 
kitchen. Off the kitchen stood an old storeroom where I was to sleep. Upstairs 
was Brad and Agatha’s room with a “crawl-through” passage into the space 
above the storeroom, which would be Terri’s room. A tiny back staircase led 
from Terri’s room down to the yard. 

Terri turned to the window. “There they are!” she said. “In the garden!” 

I could see Brad bent over a tomato stalk. Agatha was hanging some clothes 
to dry on the clothesline. 

We raced out the kitchen door. “Where have you two been?” Agatha 
demanded. She and Brad both had white, white hair, and their eyes seemed faded 
and tired. They were so frail and light. Between them I don’t think they weighed 
more than a hundred pounds. 

“We explored the beach,” I told them. 

I knelt down beside Brad. He was missing the top part of two of his fingers 
on his left hand. He told us they got caught in a wolf trap when he was young. 

“We found an old cave in some huge rocks. Have you ever seen it?” I 
asked. 

He gave a little grunt and kept searching for ripe tomatoes. 

“It’s right by the beach and the big rock jetty,” Terri added. “You can’t miss 
it.” 

Agatha’s sheets fluttered on the line. “It’s nearly suppertime,” she said, 
ignoring our questions about the cave. “Why don’t you come inside and give me 
a hand, Terri?” 

Terri glanced at me and shrugged. 

I turned back to Brad. I was about to ask him about the cave again when he 
handed me the basket of ripe tomatoes. “Take these to Agatha, okay?” 

“Sure,” I answered, following Terri inside. I set the basket on the small 
counter. The kitchen was small and narrow. Counter and sink on one side. Stove 
and refrigerator on the other. Agatha had already put Terri to work in the corner 
of the living room, setting the table. 

“Now Terri, dear,” Agatha called from the kitchen, “if it’s asters you’re 
after, the best place to find those is in the big meadow down past the lighthouse. 
Of course they’re just coming out about now, so you can take your pick there. I 



believe that’s where you can find plenty of goldenrod, too.” 

“Great!” Terri called back with her usual enthusiasm. I don’t know how she 
could get so pumped about flowers. 

Agatha noticed the basket of tomatoes on the counter. “Oh, gracious! All 
those tomatoes!” She opened a rattley old drawer and pulled out a small knife. 
“Why don’t you cut these up for a big green salad?” 

I must have made a face. 

“Don’t you like salad?” Agatha asked. 

“Not really,” I said. “I mean, I’m not a rabbit!” 

Agatha laughed. “You’re absolutely right,” she said. “Why ruin a 
homegrown tomato with lettuce? We’ll have them plain, with maybe a little 
dressing.” 

“Sounds good,” I grinned, picking up the knife. 

I listened to Agatha and Terri discuss wildflowers for a few minutes to see 
if the subject of the cave would come up again. It didn’t. I wondered why my 
two old cousins didn’t want to talk about it. 

After dinner Brad pulled out an old deck of playing cards and taught Terri 
and me how to play whist. It’s an old-fashioned card game that I’d never heard 
of before. 

Brad got a kick out of teaching us the rules. He and I played against Terri 
and Agatha. Every time I got mixed up, which was most of the time, he’d wag 
his finger back and forth at me. I guess it saved him from having to say anything. 

We went to bed after the card game. It was early, but I didn’t care. It had 
been a long day, and I was glad to get some rest. The bed was hard, but I fell 
asleep as soon as my head hit the scratchy feather pillow. 

The next morning Terri and I made our way to the woods to collect plants and 
wildflowers. 

“What is it we’re looking for again?” I asked Terri as I kicked aside piles of 
dead leaves. 

“Indian pipe,” Terri replied. “It looks like small, pinkish-white bones 
popping out of the ground. It’s also called corpse plant because it lives on the 
remains of dead plants.” 

“Yuck.” I suddenly remembered the popping hands in my cemetery dream. 

Terri laughed. “You should like these plants,” she said. “They’re a scientific 
puzzle. They’re white because they don’t have any chlorophyll. You know. The 



stuff that makes plants turn green.” 

“How interesting,” I said sarcastically, rolling my eyes. 

Terri continued her lecture anyway. “Agatha said Indian pipe only grows in 
very dark places. They look more like a fungus than a plant.” 

She dug around for a few minutes. “The weirdest thing about them,” she 
continued, “is if they dry out, they turn black. That’s why I want to try pressing a 
few.” 

I poked around in the leaves some more. I have to admit she had me 
hooked. I love freaks of nature. 

I peered up at the heavy leaf canopy above us. “We’re definitely as deep 
into the woods as we can be. Are you sure this is where Agatha said you can find 
them?” 

Terri nodded. She pointed to a huge fallen oak tree. “That’s our landmark. 
Don’t lose it.” 

I started toward the big tree. “Maybe I’ll take a closer look over there,” I 
said. “There might be Indian pipe on that dead tree.” 

I knelt down by the snakelike tree roots and began carefully pushing dead 
leaves aside. No wildflowers. Just bugs and worms. It was really gross. 

I glanced back at Terri. She didn’t seem to be having any luck, either. 

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something white sticking out of 
the ground. I scurried over to examine it. 

A short plant stem stuck up from the soft ground. The stem was covered 
with rolled-up leaves. I tugged at the stem. It didn’t come up. 

I pulled harder. 

The stem rose up a little, bringing a clump of soft dirt with it. 

It isn’t a stem, I realized. It’s some kind of root. A root with leaves. 

Weird. 

I pulled more of it up from the ground. It was very long, I discovered. 

A hard tug. Then another. 

Another hard tug of the strange root brought up a huge mound of dirt. 

I glanced down into the large hole I had made—and uttered a sharp cry. 

“Terri—come here!” I managed to choke out. “I found a skeleton!” 



5 


“Huh?” Terri raced to my side. 

We both stood and stared down at it in silence. 

The skeleton I had uncovered lay curled on its side, every bone neatly in 
place. The empty eye socket in its gray skull gaped up at us. 

“Is it a h-human?” Terri stammered in a low whisper. 

“Not unless the human has four legs, genius!” I replied. 

Terri stared down at it, her mouth open in an O of surprise. “Well, then, 
what is it?” 

“Some kind of large animal,” I told her. “Maybe a deer.” 

I stooped to take a closer look. “No. Not a deer. It has toe bones, not 
hooves.” 

I studied the skull, which was fairly large and had sharp incisors or teeth. 
When I was nine, I had a thing about skeletons. I must have read every book 
ever written about skeletons. 

“My guess is a dog,” I announced. 

“A dog?” said Terri. “Oh, poor little doggy.” She stared at the skeleton. 
“How do you think it died?” 

“Maybe an animal attacked it.” 

Terri knelt down beside me. “Why would anyone want to eat a dog?” 

“They’re high in protein!” I joked. 

She shoved me hard. “Jerry! I’m serious. What animal around here eats 
dogs?” 

“A wolf maybe. Or a fox,” I replied thoughtfully. 

“Wouldn’t a wolf or fox have crunched a few of the bones and left more of 
a mess?” Terri asked. “This skeleton is in perfect shape.” 

“Maybe it died of old age,” I suggested. “Or maybe someone buried it here 
beneath that weird root plant.” 

“Yeah. Maybe it wasn’t attacked by anything,” Terri said. I could see the 
color returning to her face. 

We sat silently over the skeleton for a minute, thinking about the dog. 

A shrill animal howl made us both jump to our feet. The frightening sound 



filled the forest, echoing through the trees. 

We held our ears as the howling grew louder. “Wh-what is it? What’s 
making that horrible cry?” Terri shrieked. I stared back at her. I didn’t know. I 
only knew it was moving closer. 



6 


The howls stopped as suddenly as they started. 

When I turned around to make sure we were safe, I saw them. 

Sam, Nat, and Louisa were huddled behind a nearby tree. Laughing. 

I glared at them. I realized instantly that they had been making the howls. 
Who did they think they were? 

It took them a long time to stop laughing. I couldn’t believe how much they 
were enjoying their little joke. 

I glanced at Terri. She was blushing. My face felt hot. I guess I was 
blushing, too. 

When they finally stopped laughing, I invited them over to see the skeleton. 

Now it was their turn to be startled. 

Sam’s eyes grew wide. Louisa let out a short cry. Nat, the little one, grabbed 
on to his sister’s sleeve and started to whimper. 

Terri dug into her jeans pockets for a tissue. “Don’t worry,” she told Nat. 
She dabbed at his cheeks with her tissue. “It’s not a person skeleton. It’s only a 
dog skeleton.” 

Those words made Nat burst into tears. 

Louisa put her arms around Nat’s trembling shoulders. “Shush,” she said. 
“It’s all right.” 

But Nat couldn’t calm himself down. “I know what happened to this dog,” 
he sobbed. “A ghost killed it. Dogs can tell if someone’s a ghost. Dogs always 
bark to warn about ghosts.” 

“Nat,” Terri said softly, “there’s no such thing as ghosts. They’re pretend.” 

Sam stepped forward, shaking his head. “You’re wrong,” he told Terri, 
narrowing his eyes at her. “There are lots of skeletons in these woods. All 
because of the ghost. He picks the bones clean and leaves them lying here.” 

“Give me a break, Sam,” Terri muttered. “Are you trying to tell us that 
there’s a ghost around here?” 

Sam stared back, but didn’t reply. 

“Well, are you?” Terri demanded. 

Suddenly Sam’s expression changed. His eyes grew wide with terror. 
“There it is!” he cried, pointing. “Right behind you!” 



7 


I let out a shriek and grabbed Terri’s arm. 

But I knew immediately that I’d been fooled again. When was I going to 
stop falling for Sam’s dumb jokes? 

“You two are too easy to scare,” Sam said, grinning. 

Terri put her hands on her hips and glared at Sam. “How about a truce, 
guys? These jokes are getting pretty lame.” 

All eyes were on Sam. 

“Yeah. Okay. A truce,” he murmured. But he had a grin on his face. I 
couldn’t tell if he meant it or not. 

“Sam, tell Jerry and me more about the ghost,” Terri demanded. “Were you 
serious about a ghost killing the dog, or was that one of your fabulous jokes?” 

Sam kicked at a clump of dirt. “Maybe some other time,” he muttered. 

“Some other time? Why not now?” I asked. 

Louisa started to say something—but Sam tugged her away. “Let’s go,” he 
said sharply. “Now.” 

Terri’s expression changed to confusion. “But I thought—” 

Sam stalked off through the trees, dragging Louisa with him. Nat hurried to 
catch up to them. 

“Bye,” Louisa called. “See you later.” 

“Did you see that?” Terri cried. “They really do believe there’s a ghost in 
these woods. They didn’t want to talk about it, so they left.” 

I stared down at the animal skeleton, lying so clean and perfect on the 
ground. 

Picked clean. 

Picked clean by a ghost. 

The words rolled through my mind. 

I stared hard at the jagged teeth in the pale skull. Then I turned away. 

“Let’s go back to the cottage,” I murmured. 

We found Brad and Agatha sitting in rocking chairs under a shady tree. Agatha 
was slicing peaches into a large wooden bowl, and Brad watched her. 



“Do you two like peach pie?” Agatha asked. 

Terri and I replied that it was one of our favorites. 

Agatha smiled. “We’ll have it tonight. I don’t know if your dad mentioned 
it, but peach pie is one of my specialties. So did you find the Indian pipe?” 

“Not exactly,” I replied. “We found a dog skeleton instead.” 

Agatha began slicing more quickly, the knife blade slipping over her thumb 
as the soft peach slices slid into the bowl. “Oh, my,” she muttered. 

“What kind of an animal would go after a dog?” asked Terri. “Are there 
wolves or coyotes around here?” 

“Never seen any,” Brad answered quickly. 

“Then how do you explain that skeleton?” I demanded. “It was perfectly 
arranged, and the bones were picked clean.” 

Agatha and Brad exchanged a worried glance. “Can’t say as I know,” said 
Agatha. Slice. Slice. Slice. “Brad? Do you have any ideas?” 

Brad rocked back and forth for a minute. “Nope.” 

Very helpful, Brad, I thought. 

“We also met three kids,” I said. I told them about Sam, Nat, and Louisa. 
“They said they know you.” 

“Yep,” Brad replied. “Neighbors.” 

“They told us a ghost must have killed the dog.” 

Agatha set down her paring knife and leaned her head back against the 
chair, laughing softly to herself. “Is that what they said? Oh, my. Those kids 
were teasing you. They love to make up ghost stories. Especially that oldest boy, 
Sam.” 

“That’s what I thought,” Terri said, glancing at me. 

Agatha nodded. “They’re nice kids. You should invite them to do 
something with you some time. Maybe you can all go blueberry picking.” 

Brad cleared his throat. His pale eyes studied me. “You’re too smart to fall 
for ghost stories, aren’t you?” 

“Yeah. I guess,” I replied uncertainly. 

We spent the rest of the afternoon helping Brad weed the garden. Weeding isn’t 
exactly my idea of a thrill. But after Brad showed us which were the good plants 
and which weren’t, Terri and I had fun spearing the bad guys with the special 
weeding tools he lent us. 

We ate the peach pie for dessert that night, and it was delicious. Agatha and 



Brad wanted to hear all about our school and our friends. 

After dinner, Brad challenged us to another game of whist. This time I did 
much better. Brad only had to wiggle his finger at me a couple of times. 

Later, I had a tough time falling asleep. The window of my little room off 
the kitchen had long, flimsy, white cotton curtains that allowed the light of the 
full moon to shine onto my face. It felt like staring into a flashlight. 

I tried covering my face with the pillow, but I couldn’t breathe. Then I tried 
resting my arm over my eyes, but my arm quickly fell asleep. 

I pulled the sheet up over my head. Better. 

I closed my eyes. The crickets were making a real racket. 

Then I heard something thump against the wall outside. Probably a tree 
branch, I told myself. 

Another thump. I slid a little further down in my bed. 

The third time I heard the sound, I took a deep breath, sat up, and tossed off 
the sheet. 

I took a careful look around the room. Nothing. Nada. Zip. 

I lay back down. 

Near the doorway, the floorboards creaked. 

I turned to the window. 

Behind the curtains, something moved. 

Something pale. Ghostly. 

The floorboards creaked again as the pale figure moved toward me. 



8 


I opened my mouth in a low, terrified scream. Then I pulled the sheet back over 
my head. 

The room grew silent. I was trembling all over. 

Where was the ghost? 

I peeked out from the sheet. 

Terri stepped out from behind the curtain. “Gotcha,” she whispered. 

“You creep,” I choked out. “How could you do that to me?” 

“Easy,” she replied, grinning. “All this ghost talk has you freaked out— 
hasn’t it.” 

I let out an angry growl, but didn’t reply. My heart was still thudding in my 
chest. 

Terri sat down on the edge of the bed. She pulled her robe around her more 
tightly. “I just couldn’t resist,” she said, still grinning. “I came down to talk to 
you, and I saw you lying there with the sheet over your head. It was too 
tempting.” 

I glared at her. “Next time pick on someone your own size,” I said angrily. 
“I had the sheet pulled up because I was having trouble falling asleep.” 

“Me, too,” Terri said. “My mattress is really lumpy.” She stared out the 
window. “And, besides, I was thinking about that ghost.” 

“Hey—you’re the one who doesn’t believe in them—remember?” I 
insisted. 

“I know. I really don’t believe in ghosts. But Sam, Louisa, and Nat 
obviously do.” 

“So?” 

“So I want to find out why. Don’t you?” 

“Not really. I don’t care if I ever see those kids again,” I said. 

Terri yawned. “Louisa seems nice. Much more friendly than Sam. I think 
we can get Louisa to tell us more about the ghost if we ask her. She almost told 
us today.” 

“Terri, I don’t believe you,” I replied, pulling the sheet up to my chin. “You 
heard what Agatha said. Sam likes to make up stories.” 

“I don’t think this is a story,” Terri said. “I know I’m supposed to be the 



scientific one in the family. But I think something strange is going on here, 
Jerry.” 

I didn’t answer. I was picturing the animal skeleton. 

“I’m going to ask them about the ghost again tomorrow,” Terri announced. 

“How do you know they’ll show up?” 

Terri grinned. “They always do, don’t they? Haven’t you noticed? No 
matter where we are, they always seem to be there.” She paused. “Do you think 
they’re following us?” 

“I hope not,” I said. 

Terri laughed. “You’re such a wimp.” 

I threw off the covers. “Am not!” 

Terri started tickling me. “Wimp! Wimp! Wimp!” 

I grabbed her arm and twisted it behind her. Then I started tickling her back. 
“Take it back,” I said. 

“Okay, okay!” she cried. “I didn’t mean it.” 

“And you’ll never call me a wimp again?” 

“Never!” 

As soon as I let go of her arm, she ran to the doorway. “See you in the 
morning—wimp!” she called. She disappeared through the kitchen. 

At breakfast the next morning, Agatha asked, “What do you kids have planned 
for today?” 

“A swim, I guess,” I replied, glancing at Terri. “Down at the beach.” 

“Be careful of the tide down there,” Brad warned. “It can sweep a full- 
grown man off his feet.” 

Terri and I glanced at each other. I don’t think we’d ever heard Brad put 
two full sentences together before. 

“We will,” Terri promised. “We’ll probably do more wading than 
swimming.” 

Agatha handed me a banged-up metal pail. “Might want to pick up some 
sea urchins or sea stars.” 

A few minutes later, I took the pail and a couple of old beach towels, and 
Terri and I headed down the twisty path along the shoreline. 

We scrambled up and down the rocks until we came to a spot not far from 
the sandy beach and the cave. 

We slid down the giant rock underneath us and then climbed on all fours 



across a few smaller rocks until we reached a wide, mossy, tide pool about three 
feet from the water’s edge. The tide pool was about the size of a kiddie pool. 

“Wow, Jerry!” Terri exclaimed, staring into the water. “I see tons of stuff in 
here.” She reached into the green, slimy water and pulled out a sea star. “It’s so 
tiny. Not even the size of my palm. Maybe it’s a baby.” 

She turned it over. Its legs wiggled. “Hello, cute little sea star,” she sang. 

Yuck. “I’ll go get the pail, okay?” I said. I climbed back over the rocks to 
where we left our things. 

Guess who was bent over our stuff? Snooping. “Find anything good?” I 
called sharply. 

Sam glanced up slowly. “I was wondering whose towels these were,” he 
said casually. 

Nat and Louisa came bounding over the rocks. “Where’s Terri?” Louisa 
asked. 

I motioned toward the water. “Down by the tide pool.” I grabbed the pail. 

They followed me back down. Terri smiled when she saw us. I could tell 
she was happy to see Louisa and her brothers. “Look at all the cool stuff I found 
in here,” Terri declared. 

Along the smooth surface of a large, flat rock she lined up the baby sea star, 
two sea urchins, and a hermit crab. 

We crowded together to see. Terri held out the sea star. “Aren’t its feet 
cute?” she asked Nat. 

He giggled. 

We spent a few minutes examining everything. Nat started rattling off 
everything he’d ever learned about crabs. Louisa finally had to cut him off. 

“I want to hear more about the ghost,” Terri told Louisa. 

“Nothing more to tell,” Louisa replied softly. She glanced nervously at 

Sam. 

Had he warned her not to talk about it anymore? 

Terri refused to give up. “Where does the ghost live?” she demanded. 

Louisa and Sam exchanged glances again. 

“Come on, guys. It has to live somewhere!” Terri teased. 

Nat gazed toward the beach and the cave. A breeze fluttered his fine, blond 
hair. He slapped a green fly on his skinny bare arm. 

“Does the ghost live on the beach?” Terri asked. 

Nat shook his head. 



“In the cave?” I guessed. 

Nat pinched his lips together. 

“I thought so,” Terri said. “In the cave.” She flashed me a triumphant grin. 
“What else?” 

Nat’s face turned red. He hid behind Louisa. “I didn’t mean to tell,” he 
whispered. 

“It’s okay,” Louisa told him, petting his hair. She turned to Terri and me. 
“The ghost is very old. No one has ever seen him come out.” 

“Louisa!” Sam said sharply. “I really don’t think we should talk about this.” 

“Why not?” Louisa shot back. “They have a right to know.” 

“But they don’t even believe in ghosts,” Sam insisted. 

“Well, maybe you can change my mind,” Terri replied. “Are you guys sure 
there’s a ghost? Have you really seen it?” 

“We’ve seen the skeletons,” Louisa said solemnly. 

Nat peeked his head out from behind Louisa’s leg. “The ghost comes out 
during the full moon,” he announced. 

“We don’t know that for sure,” Louisa corrected. “He’s been in the cave up 
there forever. Some people say for three hundred years.” 

“But if you haven’t seen him,” I said, “how do you know he’s in the cave?” 

“You can see a light flickering,” Sam replied. 

“Alight?” I hooted. “Give me a break! That could be anything. It could be a 
guy in there with a flashlight.” 

Louisa shook her head. “It’s not that kind of light,” she insisted. “It’s 
different from that.” 

“Well, a flickering light and a dog skeleton aren’t enough to convince me,” 
I said. “I think you’re just trying to scare us again. This time, I’m not falling for 
it.” 

Sam scowled. “No problem,” he muttered. “You don’t have to believe it. 
Really.” 

“Well, I don’t,” I insisted. 

Sam shrugged. “Have fun,” he said softly. He led his brother and sister back 
toward the woods. 

As soon as they were out of sight, Terri punched me in the side. “Jerry, why 
did you do that? I was just starting to weasel some good stuff out of them.” 

I shook my head. “Can’t you see they’re trying to scare us? There’s no 
ghost. It’s another dumb joke.” 



Terri stared hard at me. “I’m not so sure,” she murmured. 

I gazed up at the enormous black hole of the cave. Despite the morning 
heat, a chill ran down my back. 

Was there an ancient ghost in there? 

Did I really want to find out? 

Agatha made a really great old-fashioned chicken pot pie for dinner. I ate all of 
mine except for the peas and carrots. I’m not into vegetables. 

Terri and I were helping Agatha with the dishes after dinner when she said, 
“Jerry, I seem to be missing one of the beach towels. Didn’t you take two with 
you this morning?” 

“I guess we did,” I replied. 

“Did we leave one at the beach?” Terri asked. 

I tried to remember. “I don’t think so. I can go take a look.” 

“Don’t bother,” Agatha said. “It’s getting dark out. You can look 
tomorrow.” 

“I don’t mind,” I told her. I threw down my dish towel and bolted out the 
back door before she could say anything else. 

I was glad for an excuse to escape. That tiny kitchen was suffocating me. 
There was hardly any room to turn around in there. 

I walked along the path to the water’s edge, happy to be alone for a change. 
Terri is okay, especially for a kid sister. We get along amazingly well. But 
sometimes I like to be by myself. 

I found the big rock where we’d left our towels that morning. No sign of the 
missing towel. Maybe Sam took it, I thought. Maybe he planned to drape it over 
his head and jump out at us. 

I gazed up at the big cave, dark against the blue-black sky. 

“Huh?” 

I blinked—and took a step closer. 

Was that a light flickering in the cave? 

I took another step. It had to be the reflection of the moon, just rising over 
the pine trees. 

No. Not the moon, I realized. 

I took another few steps. I couldn’t take my eyes off the flickering light, so 
pale, so ghostly pale, in the black cave opening. 

Sam! I told myself. Yes, it’s Sam. He’s up there right now, lighting matches. 



Hoping I’ll fall for his trick. 

Should I climb up there? 

My sneakers sank into the sand as I took a few more steps toward the cave. 
The light glimmered in the cave opening. It hovered so near the entrance. 
Floating. Flickering. Dancing slowly. 

Should I go up there? I asked myself. 

Should I? 



9 


Yes. I had to climb up there. 

The light glimmered brighter, as if calling to me. 

I took a deep breath, then jumped across a tide pool and over some mossy 
rocks. Then I started up. 

The cave stood high above me, embedded in the boulders. I leaped and 
scrambled over slippery, small rocks until I reached the next big boulder. 

A halo of yellow moonlight shone down on the rocks, making it easy to see. 
What was it Nat said about the moon? Something about the ghost coming out 
when it was full? 

I scaled the next rock, and kept climbing. 

I could see the ghostly light floating above me in the cave entrance. 

Up, up I climbed over the scraggly rocks, slippery from the evening dew. 

“Oh!” I cried out as I felt my legs give way. A mini-landslide had started 
under my feet. Small rocks and sand tumbled down the hill behind me. 

Desperately, I grabbed at a fat root growing out between the rocks. I held on 
long enough to get my footing. 

Whew! I took a moment to catch my breath. 

Then I pulled myself up onto a sturdy boulder and gazed up to the cave. 
Now it was right above my head. Only another ten feet or so to go. 

I stood up—and gasped. 

Whoa! What was that noise behind me? 

I stood frozen. Waiting. Listening. 

Was someone else there? 

Was the ghost there? 

I didn’t have long to wonder. A cold, clammy hand grabbed my neck. 



10 


I uttered a choking sound and struggled to turn around. 

The cold fingers relaxed their grip. “Ssssh,” Terri whispered. “It’s me.” 

I let out an angry growl. “What do you think you’re doing?” 

“Never mind that,” she shot back. “What do you think you ’re doing?” 

“I—I’m looking for that beach towel,” I stammered. 

Terri laughed. “You’re looking for a ghost, Jerry. Admit it.” 

We both raised our eyes to the cave. “Do you see the light?” I whispered. 
“Huh? What light?” Terri demanded. 

“The light flickering in the cave,” I replied impatiently. “What’s wrong with 
you? Do you need glasses?” 

“I’m sorry. I don’t see any light,” Terri insisted. “It’s completely dark.” 

I stared up at the cave opening. Stared up into total darkness. 

She was right. The flickering light in the cave had vanished. 

As I lay in bed later that night, I tried to use what Mr. Hendrickson, my science 
teacher, calls my “critical thinking skills.” That’s when you have to put together 
whatever facts you have and those you don’t, and then draw a logical conclusion. 
So I asked myself: What do I know? 

I know I saw a light. Then the light went out. 

So what was the explanation? An optical illusion? My imagination? Sam? 
Outside the window, a dog began to bark. 

That’s weird, I thought. I hadn’t seen any dogs around here before. 

I stuffed my pillow over my ears. 

The barking grew louder, more emotional. It sounded as if it were right 
outside my window. 

I sat up, listening. 

And remembered what Nat had told us. Dogs recognize ghosts. 

Was that why the dog was barking so excitedly? 

Had the dog spotted the ghost? 

With a shiver, I climbed out of bed and crept to the window. 

I peered down to the ground. 



No dog. 

I listened. 

The barking had stopped. 

Crickets chirped. The trees whispered. 

“Here, doggy,” I called softly. 

No reply. I shivered again. 

Silence now. 

What’s going on here? I wondered. 

“Sssshhh. YouTl scare them,” Terri whispered. 

The morning sun was still a red ball, low in the sky, as we approached the 
seagull nest Terri had spotted the day before. 

Bird-watching was Terri Sadler Hobby Number Three. Unlike gravestone 
mbbings and wild-flower collecting, she could do this one back at home, right 
from our apartment window. 

We crouched down to watch. About fifteen feet away, the mother seagull 
was trying to herd her three babies back into the nest. She squawked noisily and 
chased them first in one direction, then another. 

“Aren’t the babies cute?” whispered Terri. “They look like fuzzy gray 
stuffed animals, don’t they?” 

“Actually they remind me of rats,” I replied. 

Terri poked me with her elbow. “Don’t be a creep.” 

We watched them in silence for a few minutes. “So tell me again about the 
dog barking last night,” Terri asked. “I can’t believe I didn’t hear it.” 

“There’s nothing more to tell,” I replied edgily. “When I went to the 
window, it stopped.” 

Down the beach I saw the three Sadler kids, in shorts and sleeveless T- 
shirts, walking barefoot along the shore. I jumped up and started jogging toward 
them. 

“What’s your hurry?” Terri called after me. 

“I want to tell them about the flickering light,” I called back. 

“Wait up!” Terri shouted, scrambling after me. 

We stumbled along the rocky beach toward the three kids. I saw that Sam 
was carrying a couple of old fishing poles, and Louisa had a bucket filled with 
water. 

“Hi,” Louisa said warmly, setting down the bucket. 



“Catch anything?” I asked. 

“Nope,” Nat replied. “We didn’t go fishing yet.” 

“What’s in the bucket, then?” I asked. 

Nat reached in and pulled out a small, silver fish. “Bunker. We use ’em for 
bait.” 

I leaned down and peered into the pail. Dozens of little silver-gray fish 
swarmed around inside. “Wow.” 

“Want to come?” Louisa asked. 

Terri and I traded glances. Fishing sounded like fun. And maybe it would 
give us a chance to ask casually about the light in the cave. “Sure,” I said. “Why 
not?” 

We followed them down the sandy path to a shady spot on the water. “We 
usually have good luck here,” Sam announced. 

He grabbed a bait fish out of the bucket, then steadied his fishing pole 
against his leg. He expertly threaded the fish onto the hook, then handed me the 
pole. The fish flipped back and forth on the hook. 

“Want to try?” he asked. I wondered why he was suddenly acting so nice to 
me now. Had Louisa gotten on his case? Or was he setting me up for another 
joke? 

“Sure, I’ll try,” I told him. “What do I do?” 

Sam showed me how to cast the line out. My first try wasn’t great. The line 
landed about a foot from the shore. 

Sam laughed and cast it for me again. “Don’t worry,” he said, handing the 
pole back to me. “It takes a lot of practice to learn to cast.” 

This Sam was certainly different from the Sam we had seen before. Maybe 
it just takes him a while to get friendly, I told myself. 

“Now what do I do?” I asked him. 

“Keep casting out and reeling in,” he said. “And if you feel a tug, yell.” 

Sam turned to Terri. “Do you want to try, too?” he asked. 

“Of course!” she replied. 

Sam started to grab a bunker for Terri from the bucket. 

“That’s okay,” Terri said. “I can do it.” 

Sam stepped back and let Terri do the honors. I think she must have been 
showing off. I’d never seen her bait a live fish before. She always hated slimy 
things. 

Terri started to cast out her line without any help. I was about to accuse her 



again of showing off. But then her fishing line got tangled in the tree branches 
above us. 

That got everyone laughing—especially when the bait fish squirmed off the 
hook and dropped down into Terri’s hair. Terri shrieked, thrashed her arms, and 
swatted the fish into the water. 

Sam collapsed with laughter on the rock. The rest of us laughed, too. We 
were all sprawled out on a big flat rock. 

This seemed a good time to bring up the cave. “Guess what?” I started. 
“Last night I came down to the beach, and I saw that flickering light you were 
talking about in the cave.” 

Sam’s smile faded instantly. “You did?” 

Louisa’s eyes grew wide with concern. “You... you didn’t go in there, did 
you? Please say no.” 

“No, I didn’t go inside,” I told them. 

“It’s really dangerous,” Louisa said. “You shouldn’t climb up there. Really.” 

“Yeah. Really,” Sam quickly agreed. His eyes burned into mine. 

I glanced at Terri. I could tell what she was thinking. These three kids really 
were frightened. They didn’t want to admit it. They didn’t want to talk about it. 

But they were terrified of the cave. 

Why? 

I only knew one thing for sure: I had to find out. 



11 


At dinner, we sat at the round table in the living room off the kitchen. Brad was 
tackling a piece of corn on the cob with his knife, trying to saw off all the little 
niblets so he could eat them with a fork. 

“Brad... uh... I was wondering about the cave,” I started, fiddling with my 
silverware. 

I felt Terri’s foot nudge mine under the table. 

“What about it?” Brad asked. 

“Well... uh... the strangest thing...” I hesitated. 

Agatha’s head turned sharply. “You didn’t go into that cave, did you?” 

“No,” I replied. 

“You really shouldn’t go into the cave,” she warned. “It isn’t safe.” 

“Well, that’s what I wanted to talk about,” I continued. I saw that everyone 
had stopped eating. “Last night when I went to look for the beach towel, there 
was a light flickering inside the cave. Do you know what it was?” 

Brad narrowed his eyes at me. “Just an optical illusion,” he said curtly. 
Then he picked up his corn and began sawing again. 

“I don’t understand,” I told him. “What do you mean?” 

Brad patiently put down his corn. “Jerry, did you ever hear of the northern 
lights? Aurora borealis?” 

“Sure,” I said. “But...” 

“That’s what that flickering light was,” he said, cutting me off. He picked 
up his corn again. 

“Oh,” I replied. I turned to Agatha, hoping she’d help fill in the blanks. She 
did. 

“It happens at certain times of the year,” she explained. “Something electric 
gets in the air. The whole sky lights up in streamers.” 

She reached for the bowl of mashed potatoes. “More potatoes?” 

“Sure, thanks.” I felt Terri’s foot bump me again from across the table. I 
shook my head at her. Brad and Agatha were wrong. That couldn’t have been the 
northern lights. The light was coming from the cave, not the sky. 

Were they mistaken? 

Or were they deliberately lying to me? 



* * * 


After dinner, Terri and I walked along the beach. Wisps of gray clouds floated 
over the full moon. Shadows stretched and shifted in front of us as we made our 
way over the pebbly sand. 

“They lied to me,” I insisted to Terri, my hands shoved deep into the 
pockets of my cutoffs. “Brad and Agatha are hiding something. They don’t want 
us to know the truth about the cave.” 

“They’re just worried,” my sister replied. “They don’t want us to get hurt 
up there. They feel responsible, and—” 

“Terri, look—!” I cried. I pointed up to the cave. 

This time Terri saw the flickering light, too. 

As we watched it floating above our heads in the cave entrance, the clouds 
covered the moon and the sky darkened. 

“It’s not the northern lights,” I whispered. “There’s someone up there.” 

“Let’s check it out,” Terri whispered back. 

Before we even realized what we were doing, we were climbing the rocks, 
pulling ourselves up toward the cave. It felt as if I were being pulled by a 
magnet. 

I had to get closer, close enough to see what was causing that strange, 
floating light. 

Behind us, the ocean waves crashed against the lowest rocks, spraying surf 
in every direction. 

We were almost to the mouth of the cave. I glanced back and saw that the 
beach lay far below. In the cave mouth, the light still flickered and floated. 

We pulled ourselves up the last few rocks and stood up. 

We found ourselves standing on a wide ledge. The dark cave loomed up 
ahead, towering over us. 

I peered into the cave opening. How deep was the cave? I couldn’t tell. 

Squinting into the dim light, I thought I saw a tunnel leading off to one side. 

I took a step closer. Terri moved up close beside me. I could see the fear on 
her face. She bit her lower lip. “Well?” she asked in a hushed whisper. 

“Let’s go in,” I said. 



12 


My heart thudded as we stepped into the darkness. Our sneakers slid on the 
smooth, damp cave floor. I nearly choked on the sour, musty smell. 

“Hey—!” I cried out as Terri grabbed my arm. 

“The light—look!” she whispered. 

It flickered near the back of the cave. 

Staying close together, we took a few steps toward it. Our sneakers 
squished loudly. The air grew warmer. 

“It—it’s a tunnel,” I stammered. 

The cave narrowed, then curved away. The dim light flickered from around 
the corner, from somewhere deeper in the cave. 

I swallowed hard. “Let’s just go a little farther,” I urged. 

Terri lingered behind me. “That tunnel looks creepy,” she uttered in a tiny 
voice. 

I heard a soft cluttering sound somewhere up ahead. 

“We’ve come this far,” I urged. “Might as well go just a little bit farther.” 

Following the light, we lowered our heads and stepped into the tunnel. I 
could hear the drip drip drip of water nearby. The air grew even warmer, steamy. 

The tunnel curved, then suddenly widened into a deep, round chamber. 

I stopped as I heard the cluttering sound again. A soft flapping, fluttering 
sound. Growing louder. 

“What’s that noise?” Terri cried. Her shrill voice echoed against the cave 
walls. 

Before I could answer, the fluttering became a deafening clatter. 

“Nooooo!” My cry was drowned out by the horrifying roar. 

I raised my eyes in time to see the black cave ceiling crumble and fall over 
us. 



13 


“Noooooo!” 

I was still wailing as I hit the wet cave floor. I covered my head with both 
hands. 

And waited. Waited for the crashing pain. 

The clatter swirled over me. A shrill whistle rose up over the sound. 

My heart thudding, I raised my eyes—and saw the bats. 

Thousands of black bats, flapping and fluttering, swooping back and forth 
across the chamber, darting low, then twisting away. 

The ceiling hadn’t fallen. 

By entering their chamber, Terri and I had awakened the bats. They 
whistled and hissed as they swooped wildly over our heads. 

“L-let’s get out of here!” I cried, helping Terri to her feet. “I hate bats!” 

“This is why Brad and Agatha warned us away,” Terri cried, shouting over 
the roar of fluttering wings. 

We both turned to leave. But the flickering light at the far end of the 
chamber made me stop. 

Just a few feet farther. If we made our way a few feet deeper into the 
chamber, we could solve the mystery. 

And never have to think about this frightening cave again. 

“Come on,” I shouted. I grabbed Terri’s hand and tugged. 

The bats swooped and darted over our heads, cluttering and whistling. We 
ducked our heads as we ran under them. 

To the back wall of the chamber. Into another narrow, curving tunnel. I 
pressed my back against the tunnel wall and edged forward, still holding Terri’s 
hand. 

The pale light grew brighter. 

We were getting close. 

The tunnel opened into another large chamber, about the same size as the 
first chamber. Terri and I had to shield our eyes. The entrance glowed with a 
bright, flickering light. 

I took a few slow steps in, giving my eyes a chance to adjust to the light. 



Then I saw them. 

Candles. Dozens of short white candles perched around the chamber on 
rock ledges. 

All of them lighted. All of them flickering. 

“So that explains it,” I whispered. “Flickering candlelight.” 

“It doesn’t explain anything!” Terri protested, shadows dancing over her 
pale face. “Who put the candles here?” 

We both saw the man at the same time. 

An old man with long, stringy, white hair and a beaklike nose. He sat 
hunched over a crude table made from a log of driftwood. 

Pale and terribly thin, his worn shirt hung loosely on him. His eyes were 
closed. Shadows played over him. He seemed to flicker in and out with the 
candlelight. 

As if he were part of the light. 

Part of the ghostly light. 

Terri and I froze, staring at him. Did he see us? Was he alive? 

Was he a ghost? 

His eyes opened. Large, dark eyes sunk deep in their sockets. 

He turned to us, stared back at us with those frightening sunken eyes. 

Slowly he curled a bony, gnarled finger. “Come here.” His voice was a dry 
whisper. Dry as death. 

And before we could move, he rose up from the chair and began to come 
for us. 



14 


I wanted to run. But my feet felt glued to the floor. 

As if the ghostly figure were holding me there, keeping me from escaping. 

Terri let out a low cry. She bumped me from behind. 

I think she had stumbled. But her bump got us both moving. 

I took one last glance back at the pale, flickering figure. His bony frame 
shimmered in the eerie candlelight. 

He started toward us, his mouth twisted into a strange grin. The dark eyes 
gazed at us blankly, like black buttons on a snowman. 

Then we turned and ran. 

Terri sprinted ahead of me through the tunnel, her sneakers slapping the wet 
floor. Slipping and stumbling, I struggled to keep up with her. 

My legs felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds. The blood pulsed so 
hard at my temples, I thought my head might explode. 

“Go! Go! Go!” I shouted all the way. 

I turned and glanced back. 

He was coming after us! 

“Noooo!” I screamed. 

I shouldn’t have turned back. 

I stumbled over a jagged rock—and went sprawling on the hard floor. 

I landed hard on my elbows and knees. 

Gasping for breath, I spun around. 

In time to see the ghost’s bony hands reach out for my throat. 



15 


I let out a terrified howl, scrambled to my feet, and lurched away from his bony, 
outstretched hands. 

A few feet up ahead, Terri watched in horror, her mouth open, her eyes 
wide with fright. 

I heard the ghost groan as he reached out with both arms. 

Somehow I found the strength to run. 

Terri and I were both running now. Through the narrow, curving tunnel. 
Through the bat chamber, silent and empty now. 

To the mouth of the cave. 

And then we were slipping and sliding, scrambling down the dew-wet 
boulders. Down, down to the rocky, moonlit beach. 

I turned back once. I couldn’t help it. 

The cave opening was dark now, I saw. Darker than the night sky. 

We ran along the shore, then turned into the woods. We were both breathing 
hard, panting loudly as we reached the cottage. 

I pushed open the door, stumbled in after Terri, then slammed it hard behind 
us. 

“Terri? Jerry? Is that you?” Agatha’s voice floated from the kitchen. She 
came in, wiping her hands on a checkered dish towel. “Well?” she demanded. 
“Did you find it?” 

“Huh?” I gaped at her, still struggling to catch my breath. 

Did we find the ghost? 

Is that what Agatha was asking? 

“Did you find it?” Agatha repeated. “Did you find the beach towel?” 

She stared at us in bewilderment as Terri and I burst out in relieved 
laughter. 

I couldn’t get to sleep that night. I kept picturing the ghost. His stringy, white 
hair. His sunken eyes. His bony fingers reaching out for me. 

And I kept wondering if Terri and I had done the right thing by not telling 
Agatha and Brad about him. 

“We’ll only get in trouble for going into the cave,” I had told my sister. 



“They probably won’t believe us anyway,” Terri added. 

“And why should we get them upset?” I said. 

“They’ve been so nice to us. And we went into the cave when they told us 
not to.” 

So we hadn’t told them about the frightening ghost surrounded by candles 
in the creepy cave. 

And now as I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind tossed and turned, 
too. And I wondered if Terri and I should confess to our cousins what we had 
done and seen. 

Despite the summer heat, I pulled the covers up to my chin and stared at the 
window. Behind the billowing curtains, pale white moonlight shimmered 
brightly. 

The moonlight didn’t cheer me. It reminded me of the ghost’s pale skin. 

Suddenly, my troubled thoughts were interrupted by a soft tapping. 

Tap tap. Tap tap tap. 

I sat up quickly. 

The sound was repeated. Tap tap. Tap tap tap. 

And then I heard a ghostly whisper: “Come here. ” 

Tap tap tap. 

“Come here. ” 

And I knew that the ghost had followed me home. 



16 


“Come here. ” 

Sitting up in bed, rigid with fear, I stared helplessly as a face rose up in the 
moonlit window. 

First I saw a pale tuft of hair. Then a broad forehead. A pair of dark eyes, 
gleaming blue in the bright light. 

Nat! 

He grinned at me through the window. 

“Nat! It’s you!” I cried gratefully, jumping out of bed, pulling my robe over 
my pajamas, and lurching to the open window. 

He giggled. 

I peered out. Sam had Nat on his shoulders and was lowering him to the 
ground. Louisa, in white tennis shorts and a loose-fitting gray sweater, stood 
beside them. 

“Wh-what are you guys doing out here?” I stammered. “You scared me to 
death.” 

“We weren’t trying to scare you,” Sam replied, his hands on Nat’s slender 
shoulders. “We saw you and your sister running on the beach. We wondered 
what happened.” 

“You won’t believe it!” I exclaimed. 

I realized that my voice was probably carrying up to Brad and Agatha’s 
room. I didn’t want to wake them. 

I motioned to the three kids. “Come into my room. We can talk in here.” 

Sam lifted Nat up to the windowsill. I pulled him in. Then the other two 
climbed in after him. 

They sat down on the bed. I paced excitedly in front of them. 

“Terri and I went into the cave,” I told them in a low voice. “We saw the 
ghost. He was sitting in a back chamber filled with candles.” 

All three of them showed surprise on their faces. 

“He was very old and scary-looking,” I continued. “He didn’t walk. He kind 
of floated. When he saw us, he started to chase us. I fell, and he nearly grabbed 
me. But I got away.” 

“Wow,” Sam muttered. The other two continued to stare at me in 



amazement. 

“Then what?” Nat asked. 

“Then we ran back here as fast as we could,” I told him. “That’s it.” 

They stared at me for a long moment. I tried to figure out what they were 
thinking. Did they believe me? 

Finally, Sam climbed off the bed and walked to the window. “We didn’t 
want you to know about the ghost,” he said softly, tossing back his brown hair. 

“Why not?” I demanded. 

Sam hesitated. “We didn’t want to scare you.” 

I let out a scornful laugh. “You scared Terri and me just about every time 
we saw you.” 

“That was just for fun,” Sam explained. “But we knew if you found out 
about the ghost...” His voice trailed off. 

“Have you seen him, too?” I asked, pulling my robe tighter around me. 

All three of them nodded. 

“We stay away from there,” Nat told me, scratching his arm. “The ghost is 
too scary.” 

“He’s really dangerous,” Louisa revealed. “I think he wants to kill us all.” 
Her eyes locked on mine. “Even you. You and Terri.” 

I shuddered. “Why? Terri and I didn’t do anything to him.” 

“It doesn’t matter. Nobody’s safe,” Sam said softly, glancing nervously out 
the window. “You saw the skeleton in the woods, right? That’s what the ghost 
will do to you if he catches you.” 

I shuddered again. I was really scared now. 

“There’s a way to get rid of the ghost,” Louisa said, breaking into my 
troubled thoughts. She was nervously clasping and unclasping her hands in her 
lap. “But we need your help,” she continued. “We can’t do it without you and 
Terri.” 

I swallowed hard. “What can Terri and I do?” I asked. 

Before she could answer, we heard creaking above our heads. Voices. 

Had we awakened Agatha and Brad? 

Louisa and her two brothers hurried to the window and lowered themselves 
to the ground. “Meet us at the beach—tomorrow morning,” Sam instructed. 

I stood at the window and watched them disappear into the woods. 

The room fell quiet again. The curtains fluttered gently. I stared out into the 
gently swaying pine trees. 



How can Terri and I help to get rid of an ancient ghost? I wondered. 
What can we do? 



17 


I woke up the next morning to the sound of rain. I jumped out of bed and ran to 
the window. The rain swirled in a gusting wind. In the garden, narrow rivulets of 
water had formed between the vegetable rows and trickled off into the yard. A 
thick fog had settled on the trees. 

“Do you believe this weather?” Terri asked, coming into my room. 

I spun away from the window. “Terri—listen. I have something to tell you.” 
I told her about my late-night talk with the three Sadlers. 

When I finished, Terri stared out the window. “So what do we do now? 
How can we meet them on the beach if it’s raining this hard?” 

“We can’t,” I said. “We have to wait till it stops.” 

“I hate suspense!” Terri moaned. She hurried back to her room to get 
dressed. 

I pulled on my old faded jeans, torn at both knees, and a gray sweatshirt, 
and hurried to join everyone for breakfast. Agatha cooked us oatmeal with big 
lumps of brown sugar and butter on top. 

After breakfast Brad built a big cozy fire and Terri worked on her 
wildflower collection on the floor in front of the fireplace. 

While Terri glued dried flower samples onto sheets of cardboard, I sat 
around and waited for the rain to stop. Stupid rain. 

The sun didn’t come out until after lunch. As soon as we could get away, 
Terri and I hurried to the beach. 

We waited there for nearly an hour. I practiced skipping stones, and Terri 
scrounged around for shells. No sign of Sam, Nat, and Louisa. 

“Now what?” I asked, kicking at a small rock. The whole day had been a 
big waste. 

“I brought my gravestone-rubbing stuff,” Terri replied. “Let’s go over to the 
cemetery.” 

We made our way to the small graveyard, climbed over the old stone wall, 
and took a good look around. The graves were so old. Many of the gravestones 
had been knocked over, or broken, or covered with weeds. 

The forest had started taking over. A couple of big trees had sprouted on top 
of graves, and one giant tree had crashed across the wall, knocking over several 



tombstones. 

“I’m going to look for something interesting by that big fallen tree,” Terri 
announced. 

Terri ran ahead, and I poked along at my own speed. The last time we were 
here, we stuck to the edge of the cemetery. Now I made my way into the middle. 

I started reading the names on the tombstones. The first one I stopped at 
read: Here lies the body of Martin Sadler. 

That’s strange, I thought. Another Sadler. I remembered that Sam had told 
us Sadler was a common name around here. Maybe this was the Sadler family 
section or something. 

The gravestone next to Martin Sadler belonged to Mary Sadler, his wife. 
Then a couple of Sadler kids, Sarah and Miles. 

I moved to the next row and continued reading the inscriptions. Another 
Sadler. This one was named Peter. Beside Peter lay Miriam Sadler. 

Whoa! I thought, starting to get the creeps. Didn’t anyone else ever die 
around here? 

I moved to another section. All Sadlers, too. Hiram, Margaret, Constance, 
Charity... 

Was this a whole cemetery of Sadlers? 

Terri’s scream cut through the air. “Jerry! Come here!” 

I found her near the fallen pine tree. Her face was twisted in confusion. 
“Look!” she instructed, pointing to a cluster of gravestones at her feet. 

I lowered my glance to two large stones. Thomas Sadler, died February 18, 
1641, and Priscilla Sadler, wife of Thomas. Died March 5, 1641. 

“Yeah, I know,” I told Terri. “The whole cemetery is filled with Sadlers. 
Creepy, huh?” 

“No. No. Check out the kids’ graves,” Terri said impatiently. 

I saw three small, identical stones lined up beside the parents. The three 
stones stood up straight. They were clean and easy to read. As if someone had 
taken care of them. 

I hunched down to read the names. “Sam Sadler, son of Thomas and 
Priscilla.” 

I straightened back up. “So?” 

“Read the next one,” Terri instructed. 

I lowered myself again. “Louisa Sadler.” 

“Uh-oh,” I murmured. “I bet I can guess the last name.” 



“I bet you can, too,” Terri replied in a trembling whisper. 

My eyes moved to the last marker. “Here lies Nat Sadler, who died in his 
fifth year of life.” 



18 


I stared at the three stones until they blurred before my eyes. 

Three stones. Three kids. 

Sam, Louisa, and Nat. 

All dead in the early 1600s. 

“I don’t get it,” I murmured. I felt dizzy as I climbed to my feet. “I just 
don’t get it.” 

“We have to ask Brad and Agatha about this,” Terri said. “This is just too 
weird!” 

We ran back to the cottage. I kept seeing those three stones as we ran. 

Sam, Louisa, and Nat. 

We found Brad and Agatha out back, under the trees in their matching 
rocking chairs. 

Agatha laughed as we came running up to them breathlessly. “You kids run 
everywhere, don’t you? Wish I had your pep.” 

“We were in the cemetery,” I blurted out. “We have to ask you about 
something.” 

She raised her eyebrows. “Oh? Were you working on gravestone rubbings?” 

“We didn’t get that far,” Terri told her. “We were reading the stones. They 
were all Sadlers. All of them.” 

Agatha’s chair rocked back and forth steadily. She nodded, but didn’t say 
anything. 

“You know those kids we met on the beach?” I broke in. “Well, we found 
tombstones for Sam, Louisa, and Nat Sadler. They died in 1640-something. But 
those are the same names as the kids we met!” 

Agatha and Brad rocked in unison. Back and forth. Back and forth. Agatha 
smiled up at me. “Well, what’s your question, Jerry?” 

“How come there are so many Sadlers in that graveyard?” I asked. “And 
how come those stones have our friends’ names on them?” 

“Good questions,” Brad muttered quietly. 

Agatha smiled. “It’s nice to see you’re both so observant. Sit down. It’s sort 
of a long story.” 

Terri and I dropped down onto the grass. “Tell us,” I urged impatiently. 



Agatha took a deep breath and began. “Well, in the winter of 1641, a large 
group of Sadlers, practically the whole family, sailed from England and settled 
here. They were Pilgrims who came to start a new life.” 

She glanced at Brad, who continued to rock, staring out at the shimmering 
trees. “It was one of the worst winters in history,” Agatha continued. “And, 
sadly, tragically, the Sadlers were unprepared for the cold. They died, one by 
one, and were buried in the little cemetery. By 1642, there were almost none 
left.” 

Brad tsk-tsked and shook his head. 

Agatha, rocking in a steady rhythm, continued. “Your friends Sam, Nat, and 
Louisa are your distant cousins. Like Brad and me. They were named for their 
ancestors, the children buried in the cemetery. We were named for our ancestors, 
too. You’ll find gravestones for an Agatha and Bradford Sadler in the cemetery, 
too.” 

“We will?” Terri cried. 

Agatha nodded solemnly. “That’s right. But your cousin and I aren’t quite 
ready for the bone-yard, yet. Are we, Brad?” 

Brad shook his head. “No, ma’am!” he replied, grinning. 

Terri and I laughed. 

Relieved laughter. 

I was so glad there was a good explanation for what we had seen. I 
suddenly felt tempted to tell Brad and Agatha about the ghost in the cave. 

But Terri started talking about wildflowers, and I settled onto the grass and 
kept my thoughts to myself. 


* * * 


We finally ran into Sam, Louisa, and Nat on the beach the next morning. 

“Where were you guys?” I asked. “We waited for you here all afternoon.” 
“Hey, give us a break,” Sam protested. “It was raining. We weren’t allowed 
outside.” 

“We were at the little graveyard yesterday,” Terri told them. “We saw three 
old gravestones with your names on them.” 

Louisa and Sam exchanged glances. “Those are our ancestors,” Sam said. 
“We were named after them.” 


“Jerry said you have a plan to get rid of the ghost,” Terri broke in. My sister 



always likes to get down to business. 

“We do,” Sam said, his expression turning serious. “Come with us.” He 
began walking quickly over the pebbly sand toward the cave. 

I hurried to catch up. “Whoa! Where are we going? I’m not climbing back 
inside that cave again. No way!” I cried. 

“Me either,” Terri agreed. “Being chased once by a ghost was enough for 

me.” 

Sam’s hazel eyes locked on mine. “You don’t have to go into the cave 
again. I promise.” 

He led us to the rocks below the cave. I gazed up, shielding my eyes against 
the bright sunlight. 

The cave looked a little less frightening in the daytime. The smooth, white 
stone gleamed. The dark entrance didn’t seem as deep and forbidding. 

Sam pointed up at the mouth. “See all those big rocks piled on top of the 
cave?” 

I squinted. “What about them?” 

“All you have to do is climb up there and push those rocks down. The rocks 
will cover the mouth of the cave, and the old ghost will be trapped inside 
forever.” 

Terri and I stared at the enormous, white rocks. Each one must have 
weighed about two hundred pounds. “You’re kidding, right?” I said. 

Louisa shook her head. “We’re very serious,” she murmured. 

“We cover the cave mouth with rocks?” I repeated, staring up at it. The dark 
hole seemed to stare back at me like a giant, black eye. “And that will keep the 
ghost inside? What will stop him from floating out? He’s a ghost, remember. He 
can float right through the rocks.” 

“No, he can’t,” Louisa explained. “The old legends say that the cave is a 
sanctuary. That means that if something evil gets trapped inside, it can’t escape 
through the ancient rocks. The ghost will be trapped inside forever.” 

Terri frowned. “So why didn’t you ever go up and push the rocks down?” 

“We’re too scared,” Nat blurted out. 

“If we mess up, the ghost could come after us,” Sam said. “We live here. He 
could find our house—and get revenge.” 

“We’ve been waiting for outsiders to come help us,” Louisa added, gazing 
at me with pleading eyes. “We’ve been waiting for someone we could trust.” 

“But what about us?” I demanded. “If we try to trap the ghost tonight and 



we mess up, won’t he come out looking for us?” 

“We won’t mess up,” Sam replied solemnly. “We’ll all work together. If the 
ghost comes out, Nat, Louisa, and I will distract him. We won’t let him see that 
you’re up on top.” 

“Will you help us? Please?” Louisa begged. “Our whole lives, the old ghost 
has terrified us.” 

“You would make everyone around here happy if you agreed to help trap 
him,” Sam added. 

I hesitated. So many things could go wrong. 

What if the rocks wouldn’t budge? What if the ghost floated out and found 
Terri and me up there? What if one of us slipped and fell off the top of the cave? 

No, I decided. No way. We can’t do it. It’s just too risky. 

I turned to tell them my decision. 

“Of course we’ll help you,” I heard Terri say. 



19 


We spent the afternoon picking blueberries with Agatha. Then we made 
blueberry ice cream using an old-fashioned churn. It tasted better than any ice 
cream I’d ever eaten. Agatha said it was because we picked the blueberries 
ourselves. 

As it got closer to suppertime, I started feeling more and more frightened. 
Were we really going to try to trap a ghost tonight? 

Dinnertime finally came. I hardly ate a thing. When Agatha stared at me, I 
explained I had filled up on ice cream. 

After dinner, Terri and I helped Agatha with the dishes. Then Brad insisted 
on showing me how to tie sailor knots. By this time, my stomach felt more 
knotted up than Brad’s rope! 

Finally, Terri and I said we were going to the beach to get some fresh air. 
And we hurried out to meet our three friends. 

It was a clear, cloudless night. Thousands of stars twinkled overhead. A 
heavy dew was falling. The full moon made it easy to see without a flashlight. 

Terri and I padded in silence along the path down to the beach. Neither of 
us felt like talking. I kept thinking about Mom and Dad’s warning to me before 
we left home to keep Terri from getting into trouble. 

Well, we’re in trouble now, I thought grimly. Deep trouble. Both of us. 

Maybe all five of us. 

Sam, Louisa, and Nat stood waiting at the edge of the shore. The moonlight 
made the dark water sparkle. I suddenly wished it weren’t so bright out. What 
we were about to do needed darkness. 

The knots in my stomach seemed to tighten as I greeted our three friends. 

Sam raised a finger to his lips and motioned for us to follow him. Silently, 
we picked our way across the rocks to the base of the cave. 

“Hey—look,” I whispered, staring up at the cave. The light flickered 
brightly in the entrance. 

The ghost was home. 

I stared up at the cave and planned our route. We’d go up the same way we 
had the other night. But instead of entering the cave, we’d keep climbing around 
the side until we reached the top. 



Terri fidgeted beside me. “Ready?” I whispered. 

She nodded grimly. 

“We’ll wait down here,” Sam whispered. “If the ghost comes out, we’ll be 
ready to distract him. Good luck.” 

The three of them stood huddled together. Their expressions were tense, 
frightened. Nat gripped Louisa’s hand. “Bye, Terri,” he said in a tiny voice. I 
think he had a little crush on her. 

“See you in a few minutes,” Terri whispered back to him. “Don’t worry, 
Nat. We’ll get rid of that bad ghost. Come on, Jerry.” 

My legs felt rubbery as Terri and I made our way over the rocks. We 
climbed steadily. Carefully. 

I glanced back at Terri, a few feet behind me. She was breathing hard, her 
eyes narrowed in concentration. 

We reached the mouth of the cave. The light inside shone brightly. 

I pointed to our right. Terri nodded. She followed me up the rocks on the 
side of the cave. 

The rocks were damp from the evening dew, and slippery. We were 
hunched on all fours as we climbed. It was steeper than I had thought. 

I struggled to keep from trembling. I knew that one slip could cause a rock 
slide. The ghost would know something was up. 

Hand over hand we climbed. 

Carefully. Steadily. 

I stopped to catch my breath and gazed down to the beach. Our three 
friends hadn’t moved. 

Holding on to a rock with one hand, I waved to them with my other. Nat 
waved back. The other two remained still, staring up at Terri and me. 

I reached the smooth rock surface of the top of the cave. Turning, I held out 
my hand and helped Terri up onto the narrow ledge. 

Together we checked out the situation. The rocks we were supposed to roll 
over the mouth of the cave weren’t as big as I’d thought. They were piled in a 
solid wall. It didn’t seem that difficult to get behind them and push them over. 

As I started to move behind the rock wall, I caught a glimpse of our three 
friends down below. To my surprise, Sam was waving his arms and jumping up 
and down. Louisa and Nat were also motioning frantically. 

“What’s wrong?” Terri cried. “Why are they doing that?” 

“They’re trying to tell us something,” I replied, feeling a chill of terror 



freeze every muscle. 

Had the ghost appeared in the cave mouth? 

Were Terri and I caught already ? 

I took a deep breath and, ignoring my fear, leaned over the edge to peer 
down at the mouth of the cave. 

No one there. 

“Jerry—stand up!” Terri cried. “You’ll fall!” 

I stood back up and peered down at the three kids. “Hey—!” I cried out as I 
saw them running to the woods. 

A stab of terror made me gasp. “Something’s gone wrong,” I croaked. 
“Let’s get out of here!” 

I turned in time to see the ghost step up behind us. 

His entire body shimmered, pale in the bright moonlight. His vacant, 
sunken eyes glared angrily at us. 

He grabbed me by the shoulder and wrapped his other bony hand around 
Terri’s waist. 

“Come with me,” he said in a dry whisper, a whisper of doom. 



20 


He dragged us down to the cave entrance. 

He’s so strong, I thought. So strong for someone old and frail-looking. 

The rocks slid under my feet, a gray blur. The ground appeared to tilt and 
sway. Long shadows seemed to reach out to me, to pull me down. 

I tried to cry out, but my breath caught in my throat. 

I tried to jerk free of his grasp. But he was too strong for me. 

Terri uttered loud, sobbing gasps. She thrashed her arms, struggling to free 
herself. 

But the old ghost held her tightly. 

Before I knew it, we were stumbling through the dark, twisting tunnels. The 
flickering candlelight grew brighter up ahead. We were too frightened to fight 
him, too frightened to break away. 

My shoulder scraped against the narrow tunnel wall. Terror tightened my 
throat. I couldn’t even cry out from the pain. 

The ghost released us as we reached the candlelit chamber. Glaring at us 
sternly, he motioned with a bony finger for us to follow him to his driftwood 
table. 

“Wh-what are you going to do to us?” Terri managed to choke out. 

He didn’t reply. 

He brushed the long, stringy white hair from over his face. Then he 
motioned for us to sit down on the floor. 

I dropped down quickly. My legs were shaking so hard, I was grateful not 
to have to stand. 

I glanced at my sister. Her lower lip was trembling. Her hands were clasped 
tightly in her lap. 

The old ghost cleared his throat. He leaned heavily against the crude table. 
“You are both in serious trouble,” he said in a thin, reedy voice. 

“We—we didn’t mean to do any harm,” I blurted out. 

“It is dangerous to get involved with ghosts,” he said, ignoring my words. 

“We’ll go away,” I offered desperately. “We’ll never come back.” 

“We didn’t mean to disturb you,” Terri added in a shrill voice. 



His sunken eyes suddenly widened in surprise. 

“Me?” A strange smile played across his pale face. 

“We won’t tell anyone we saw you,” I told him. 

His smile grew wider. “Me?” he repeated. He leaned forward on the large 
chunk of driftwood. “I’m not a ghost!” he cried. “Your three friends are!” 



21 


“Huh?” I gaped at the old ghost in disbelief. 

His smile faded. “I’m telling you the truth,” he said softly, rubbing his pale 
cheek with a bony hand. 

“You’re trying to trick us,” Terri replied. “Those three kids—” 

“They’re not kids,” the old man interrupted sharply. “They’re over 350 
years old!” 

Terri and I exchanged glances. The blood was pounding so hard at my 
temples, I couldn’t think clearly. 

“Allow me to introduce myself,” the old man said, lowering himself onto 
the table edge. His lined face flickered in the shifting candlelight. “I’m Harrison 
Sadler.” 

“Another Sadler?” I blurted out. 

“We’re Sadlers, too!” Terri cried. 

“I know,” he said softly. He coughed, a dry, hacking cough. “I came here 
from England quite a while ago,” he told us. 

“In 1641?” I demanded. 

He is a ghost, I realized with a shudder. 

My question seemed to amuse him. “I haven’t been here that long,” he 
replied dryly. “After college, I traced my ancestors here. I study ghosts and the 
occult.” He sighed. “It turned out there was plenty to study here.” 

I stared hard at him, studying him. Could he possibly be telling the truth? 
Was he human—not a ghost? 

Or was this an evil trick? 

His black, sunken eyes didn’t reveal anything to me. 

“Why did you drag us in here?” I demanded, climbing to my knees. 

“To warn you,” Harrison Sadler replied. “To warn you about the ghosts. 
You are in great danger here. I have studied them. I have seen their evil.” 

Terri let out a low cry. I couldn’t tell if she believed the old man or not. 

I realized that I didn’t believe him at all. His story didn’t make any sense. 

I climbed to my feet. “If you are a scientist studying the occult,” I said, 
“why are you shut up here in this weird cave?” 



He slowly raised his hand and motioned toward the shadowy ceiling. “This 
cave is a sanctuary,” he murmured. 

Sanctuary? That was the word that Sam had used. 

“Once inside this cave,” Harrison explained, “ghosts cannot escape through 
the rocks.” 

“So that means you are trapped in here,” I insisted. 

His eyes narrowed at me. “My plan is to trap the ghosts in here,” he replied 
softly. “That is why I stacked the rocks above the entrance. I hope some day to 
trap them in here forever.” 

I turned to my sister. She stared thoughtfully at Harrison. 

“But why are you living here?” I demanded. 

“I am safe here,” he replied. “The sanctuary keeps me safe. The ghosts 
cannot surprise me by coming through the rocks. Didn’t you wonder why they 
sent you up here instead of coming up themselves?” 

“They sent us up here because they’re terrified of you!” I shouted, 
forgetting my fear. “They sent us up here because you ’re the ghost!” 

His expression changed. He pushed himself away from the driftwood table 
and moved quickly toward Terri and me. His deep, sunken eyes glowed like dark 
coals. 

“What are you going to do?” I cried. 



22 


Harrison took another menacing step toward us. “You don’t believe me, do 
you?” he accused. 

Terri and I were too frightened to answer. 

“Wh-what are you going to do?” I repeated, my voice tiny and shrill. 

He glared at us for a long moment, the candlelight flickering over his pale 
face. “I’m going to let you go,” he said finally. 

Terri let out a cry of surprise. 

I edged back, toward the tunnel. 

“I’m going to let you go,” Harrison Sadler repeated. “So that you can 
examine the east corner of the old graveyard.” He waved a bony hand. “Go. Go 
now. To the graveyard.” 

“You—you’re really letting us go?” I stammered. 

“Once you’ve seen the east corner, you’ll come back,” Harrison replied 
mysteriously. “You’ll come back.” 

No way, I thought, my heart pounding. 

No way I’ll ever come near this frightening cave again. 

“Go!” the old ghost cried. 

Terri and I spun around and scrambled out of his chamber. Neither of us 
looked back. 

As we hurried out of the cave and down the rocks, I couldn’t get Harrison’s face 
out of my mind. I kept picturing his glowing, evil eyes, his long, stringy hair, his 
yellow teeth when he flashed us that eerie smile. With a shudder, I remembered 
the inhuman strength of his grip as he dragged Terri and me into his chamber. 

I also couldn’t stop thinking about Sam, Louisa, and Nat. There was no way 
they were ghosts. They were our friends. They had tried to warn Terri and me 
that the ghost was sneaking up behind us. 

They said they’d been terrified of Harrison their whole lives. And I 
remembered Nat’s sad face as he told us how much he was scared of ghosts. 

Harrison Sadler is a liar, I thought bitterly. 

A 350-year-old ghost of a liar. 

Down on the beach, Terri and I stopped to catch our breath. “He—he’s so 



scary!” Terri gasped. 

“I couldn’t believe he let us go,” I replied, bending over, pressing my hands 
against my knees, waiting for the sharp pain in my side to fade. 

I searched for our three frends. But they were nowhere to be seen. 

“Are we going to the graveyard?” I asked. 

“I know what he wants us to see,” Terri replied, gazing back up at the dark 
cave. “I know why he wants us to check out the east corner. That’s where we 
found the gravestones for Louisa, Nat, and Sam.” 

“Yeah, so?” 

“Harrison is just trying to scare us. He thinks if we see the old graves, it 
will prove to us that Louisa, Nat, and Sam are ghosts.” 

“But we already know the truth about those old graves,” I said. 

We stepped off the beach and into the trees. The air grew cooler. Moonlight 
trickling through the branches overhead made strange shadows stretch across our 
path. 

We reached the cemetery entrance and stopped. 

“Might as well check it out,” Terri murmured. I followed her through the 
graveyard, stepping over footstones and loose brush as we made our way to the 
east corner. 

A pale beam of moonlight played over the three old Sadler kids’ graves. 
“See anything strange?” Terri whispered. 

My eyes roamed the area. “Nope.” 

We stepped up to the Sadler kids’ graves. 

“These look the same as yesterday,” I said. “Neat, square... whoa!” 

Something caught my eye in the corner. 

“What’s your problem?” Terri demanded. 

My eyes struggled to see in the pale light. “I think there’s something...” 

“Huh? Do you see something?” Terri cried. 

“Some fresh dirt,” I said. “In the corner. On the other side of that fallen tree. 
It looks like a fresh grave.” 

“No way,” said Terri. “I’ve checked out all these gravestones. No one’s 
been buried in here for the last fifty years.” 

We took a couple of steps toward the fallen tree. 

“Jerry! You’re right! It is a grave,” Terri whispered. “Afresh grave.” 

We stepped over the fallen tree trunk, keeping close together. A narrow 
shaft of moonlight lit up the freshly dug ground. 



“It’s two graves!” I gasped. “Two fresh graves with little markers on them.” 
I squatted down to try to read them. Terri moved behind me. “What do they 
say, Jerry?” 

My mouth went dry. I couldn’t answer her. 

“Jerry? Can you read them?” 

“Yes,” I finally choked out. “It’s us, Terri. The names on these markers 
read, ‘Jerry Sadler and Terri Sadler’.” 



23 


“Wh-what does this mean?” I stammered. 

“Who dug these graves?” Terri asked. “Who put up these markers?” 

“Let’s get out of here,” I urged, grabbing her arm. “Let’s go tell Agatha and 
Brad.” 

Terri hesitated. 

“We have to,” I insisted. “We have to tell them everything. We should have 
told them a long time ago.” 

“Okay,” Terri agreed. 

I turned to leave—and gasped when I saw the three figures staring at us 
from the shadows. 

Sam stepped quickly over the fallen tree. “Where are you going?” he asked. 
“What are you doing here?” 

Louisa and Nat followed close behind him. 

“We—we’re going back to the cottage,” I told them. “It’s late, and—” 

“Did you kill the ghost?” Nat demanded. His eyes peered up at me 
hopefully. 

I patted his hair. It felt real. His head was warm. He didn’t feel ghostlike at 
all. He was a real little boy. 

Harrison Sadler is a total liar, I thought. 

“Did you kill the old ghost?” Nat repeated eagerly. 

“No. We couldn’t,” I told him. Nat let out a disappointed sigh. 

“Then how did you get away?” Sam demanded suspiciously. 

“We ran away,” Terri told him. 

It was almost the truth. 

“Where were you guys?” I demanded. 

“Yeah. You didn’t do a very good job of distracting him,” Terri added 
sharply. 

“We—we tried to warn you,” Louisa replied, tugging nervously at a strand 
of long, auburn hair. “Then we got scared. We ran into the woods and hid.” 

“When we didn’t hear the rocks fall, we got even more scared,” Sam added. 
“We were afraid the ghost got you. We were afraid we would never see you 



again.” 

Nat uttered a frightened sob and took Louisa’s hand. “We have to kill the 
ghost,” the little guy whimpered. “We have to.” 

Sam and Louisa tried to comfort their little brother. I gazed down at the two 
fresh graves. A cool wind made the trees whisper and shake. 

I started to ask Sam about the two graves. But he spoke before I had a 
chance. “Let’s try again,” he said, staring hard at Terri then me with pleading 
eyes. 

Louisa rested her hands on Nat’s tiny shoulders. “Yes,” she agreed softly. 
“Let’s go back and try again.” 

“No way!” I cried. “Terri and I got away from there once. I’m not going 
back and—” 

“But it’s the perfect time!” Louisa insisted. “He’ll never expect you to come 
back tonight. We’ll catch him completely offguard. It will be a total surprise.” 

“Please!” Nat begged in a tiny voice. 

I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. I couldn’t believe they were 
asking us to do this. 

Terri and I had risked our lives by climbing up there. We could have been 
killed by that lying old ghost. We could look like that horrible dog skeleton right 
now. 

And here they were, asking us to climb right back up there and try again. 

It was a ridiculous idea. No way I would agree to it. No way! 

“Okay,” I heard my sister say. “We’ll do it.” Louisa and her brothers burst 
into happy cheers. Terri had done it to me again. 



24 


Terri led the way to the beach. I scrambled to catch up with her. The three 
Sadlers, talking excitedly among themselves, trailed behind. 

The night suddenly seemed darker, as if someone had dimmed the lights. I 
raised my eyes, searching for the full moon. But it had disappeared behind heavy 
clouds. 

I felt a large raindrop on my shoulder, then another on the top of my head. 
The wind picked up as we neared the ocean. 

“Are you totally crazy?” I whispered to my sister as we made our way over 
the pebbly sand toward the cave. “How could you agree to do this?” 

“We have to solve the mystery,” Terri replied, glancing up at the cave. It sat 
darkly above the rocks. No flickering light. No sign of the old ghost. 

“This isn’t one of your dumb mystery books,” I told her angrily. “This is 
real life. We could be in terrible danger.” 

“We already are,” she replied mysteriously. She said something else, but the 
strong wind off the ocean carried her words away. 

The raindrops started to come down faster. Large, heavy drops. 

“Stop, Terri,” I demanded. “Let’s turn back. Let’s tell the kids we changed 
our minds.” 

She shook her head. 

“Let’s at least go back to the cottage and tell Agatha and Brad,” I pleaded. 
“We can trap the ghost tomorrow. During the day, maybe...” 

Terri kept walking. She picked up the pace. “We have to solve the mystery, 
Jerry,” she said again. “Those two fresh graves—they really scared me. I have to 
find out the truth.” 

“But, Terri—the truth is, we might get killed!” I cried. 

She didn’t seem to hear me. I brushed raindrops from my eyebrows. The 
gusting winds were swirling the rain around us. The rain pattered against the 
rocks, sounding like sharp drumbeats. 

We stopped at the bottom of the rocks. Up above, the cave stood over us, 
still completely dark. 

“We’ll wait down here,” Sam said. His eyes kept darting up to the cave. I 
could tell he was really frightened. “This time we’ll do a better job of distracting 



the ghost if he comes out.” 

“He better not come out,” I muttered, lowering my head against the falling 

rain. 

A jagged bolt of white lightning crackled across the sky. 

I shivered. 

“Come up with us,” Terri told the three of them. “You can’t help us way 
down here.” 

They hung back. I could see the fear on their faces. 

“Come up to the cave entrance,” Terri urged. “You can always run down the 
rocks if the ghost appears.” 

Louisa shook her head. “We’re too afraid,” she confessed. 

“We need your help,” Terri insisted. “We don’t want the ghost to know 
we’re on top of the cave. Come stand on the ledge in front of the cave. Then—” 

“No! He’ll hurt us! He’ll eat us up!” Nat cried. 

“Jerry and I can’t go up there again unless you come up to help us,” Terri 
insisted firmly. 

Louisa and Sam exchanged frightened glances. Nat clung to Louisa, 
trembling. The rain swept down harder. 

Finally Sam nodded. “Okay. We’ll wait for you at the cave mouth.” 

“We don’t mean to be so frightened,” Louisa added. “It’s just that we’ve 
been afraid of him our whole lives. He—he—” Her voice trailed off. 

We turned and started our climb. It was much harder this time. It was so 
much darker without the moon. Rain kept blowing into my eyes. And the rocks 
were slippery and wet. 

I stumbled twice, fell forward, scraping my knees and elbows. The wet 
rocks kept sliding under my sneakers, rolling down toward the beach. 

Another jagged bolt of lightning stretched across the sky, making the cave 
glow white above us. 

We stopped at the ledge in front of the dark cave mouth. My entire body 
trembled. From the rain. From the cold. From fear. 

“Let’s just warm up inside for a moment,” Terri suggested. 

The three Sadlers clung together. “No, we can’t. We’re too scared,” Louisa 
replied. 

“Just for a second,” Terri insisted. “Just to wipe the rain from our eyes. 
Look—it’s coming down in sheets.” 

She practically shoved Louisa and her brothers into the cave. Nat began to 



cry. He held on tightly to his sister. 

A roar of thunder made us all jump. 

This is the dumbest thing I have ever done, I thought, shivering. 

I will never forgive Terri for this. Never. 

And then a yellow light flared in front of us at the mouth of the cave. 

And under the yellow light, the old ghost flickered into view. He carried a 
flaming torch in one hand. A strange smile played over his pale face. 

“Well, well,” he uttered in a voice just loud enough to be heard over the 
rain. “Here we all are.” 



25 


“Nooo!” Nat let out a terrified wail and tried to bury his head in his sister’s wet 
T-shirt. Sam and Louisa froze like statues. The flickering light of the torch 
revealed expressions of horror on their faces. 

Harrison Sadler stood in the cave entrance blocking our escape. His dark, 
sunken eyes peered from one of us to the next. 

Behind him, the rain crashed down, glowing eerily from flashes of bright 
lightning. 

He turned his attention to Terri and me. “You brought the ghosts to me,” he 

said. 

“You’re the ghost!” Sam cried. 

Nat wailed, his arms wrapped tightly around Louisa’s waist. 

“You have terrified people long enough,” the old man told the three 
trembling kids. “More than three hundred years. It is time for you to leave this 
place. Time for you to rest.” 

“He’s crazy!” Louisa cried to me. “Don’t listen to him!” 

“Don’t let him fool you,” Sam added with emotion. “Look at him! Look at 
his eyes! Look where he lives—all alone in this dark cave! He’s the three- 
hundred-year-old ghost. And he’s lying to you!” 

“Don’t hurt us!” Nat wailed, clinging to Louisa. “Please don’t hurt us!” 

The rain suddenly slowed. Water splattered off the rocks outside and 
dripped steadily from the top of the cave. Thunder rumbled, but in the distance. 
The storm was moving out to sea. 

I turned and caught the strangest expression on my sister’s face. To my 
surprise, Terri was actually smiling. 

She caught me staring at her. “The solution,” she whispered. 

And I suddenly realized why she had agreed to come back to this 
frightening cave, to face the frightening old man again. 

Terri wanted to solve the mystery. She needed to solve it. 

Who was the ghost? 

Was it Harrison Sadler? Or was Harrison telling us the truth? Were our 
three friends the ghosts? 

My sister is really crazy, I thought, shaking my head. She risked our lives 



because she had to solve the mystery. 

“Let us go,” Sam told the old man, breaking into my thoughts. “Let us go, 
and we won’t tell anyone we saw the ghost.” 

The torchlight dipped low as a strong gust of wind invaded the cave. 
Harrison’s eyes seemed to grow darker. “I’ve waited too long to get you here,” 
he said quietly. 

Louisa suddenly reached out to Terri. “Help us!” she cried. “You believe us 
—don’t you?” 

“You know we’re alive, not ghosts,” Sam said to me. “Help us get away 
from him. He’s evil, Jerry. We’ve seen his evil our whole lives.” 

I turned from Harrison to the three kids. 

Who was telling the truth? Who was alive? And who had been dead for 
over three hundred years? 

Harrison’s face hovered darkly in the dipping, waving torchlight. He pushed 
his long, stringy hair off his forehead with his free hand. And then he startled us 
all by puckering his dry lips and letting out a long, high-pitched whistle. 

My heart skipped a beat. I gasped. What was he doing? Why was he 
making that shrill sound? 

He stopped. Then whistled again. 

I heard the scraping of footsteps, rapid footsteps on the stone cave floor. 

And then a low, dark figure came loping toward us out of the darkness. 



26 


A monster! I thought. 

A ghost monster. 

It uttered low, menacing growls as it neared. Its head bobbed low, and two 
red eyes flared as the creature bounded into the light of the flaming torch. 

“Oh!” I cried out as I saw that it was a dog. A long, lean German shepherd. 

The dog stopped a few feet in front of us. When it saw Harrison, it bared its 
teeth. Its growl became a ferocious snarl. 

Dogs can recognize ghosts, I remembered. 

Dogs can recognize ghosts. 

The dog’s red eyes caught the light of the torch as it turned to Louisa and 
her two brothers. 

It reared back on its hind legs—and began to howl and bark. 

“They’re the ghosts!” Harrison Sadler cried triumphantly to Terri and me, 
pointing. 

Snarling, the big dog leaped at Sam. 

With a cry of fright, Sam raised both arms to shield himself. 

The three kids edged deeper into the cave. 

The dog barked fiercely, baring its jagged teeth. 

“You—you really are ghosts?” I cried out. 

Louisa let out a pained sigh. “We never had a chance to live!” she cried. 
“The first winter—it was so horrible!” Tears rolled down her cheeks. I saw that 
Nat was crying, too. 

The dog continued to snarl and rage. The three kids backed farther into the 
dark chamber. 

“We sailed here with our parents to start a new life,” Sam explained in a 
trembling voice. “But we all died in the cold. It wasn’t fair! It just wasn’t fair!” 

The rain started up again. The wind blew sheets of water into the cave 
entrance. The torch flame dipped and nearly blew out. 

“We never had a life at all!” Louisa cried. 

Thunder roared. The cave seemed to shake. The dog growled and snarled. 

And as I stared at the three kids in the wavering light, they began to change. 



Their hair dropped off first. It fell in clumps to the cave floor. 

And then their skin peeled away, curling up and falling off—until three 
grinning skulls stared at Terri and me through empty eye sockets. 

“Come stay with us, cousins'.” Louisa’s skull whispered. Her bony fingers 
reached out toward us. 

“Join usssss!” Sam hissed. His fleshless jaw slid up and down. “We dug 
such nice graves for you. So close to ours.” 

“Play with me,” Nat’s skull pleaded. “Stay and play with me. I don’t want 
you to go. Ever!” 

The three ghosts moved toward us, their skeleton hands outstretched, 
reaching, reaching for Terri and me. 

I gasped and stumbled back. 

I saw a frightened Harrison stagger back, too. 

And then the torch blew out. 



27 


The torchlight flickered and died. 

The heavy darkness made me gasp. 

I could feel bodies moving, scraping over the wet stone cave floor. 

I could hear the whispered pleas of the three ghosts. 

Closer. Closer. 

And then a cold hand gripped mine. 

I screamed before I heard her whispered voice: “Jerry—run!” 

Terri! 

Before I could catch my breath, my sister was pulling me through the 
darkness. 

Into the rain. Onto the slippery rock ledge. 

“Run! Run!” Terri cried, her eyes wild, her cold hand still gripping mine. 
“Run! Run!” 

The word became a desperate chant. 

“Run! Run!” 

But as we struggled to lower ourselves down the rocks, the roar of thunder 
drowned out Terri’s shouts. 

The ground shook. 

My legs nearly slid out from under me. 

I cried out when I realized the roar in my ears wasn’t thunder. 

Half-blinded by the rain, Terri and I spun around in time to see the rocks 
topple from the top of the cave. 

The rain and wind must have loosened them. And now the big boulders 
rumbled down, cracking, knocking against each other, bumping, and rolling. 
Rock after rock, thudding onto the stone ledge. 

Until the dark cave mouth was completely covered. 

Shielding my eyes from the rain with both hands, I peered up at the cave, 
and waited. 

Waited to see if anyone would come out. 

But no one did. 

No ghostly kids. 



No old man. 

Harrison Sadler had given his life to capture the ghosts. 

The cave glimmered white in a flash of lightning. 

Now it was my turn to pull Terri away. “Let’s go,” I pleaded. 
But she didn’t budge. She stood staring through the rain at 

cave. 

“Terri—please. Let’s go. It’s over,” I said, tugging her away, 
is solved. The terror—it’s all over.”

“The mystery

A few minutes later, Agatha threw open the front door of the cottage and rushed 
out to greet us. “Where were you? Brad and I were worried sick!” 

She ushered us in, fussing over us, shaking her head, talking excitedly, glad 
we were back safe and sound. 

Terri and I got dried off and into clean clothes. 

The rain had stopped by the time we joined Brad and Agatha in the kitchen 
for steaming mugs of hot cider. Outside the kitchen window, the wind still blew 
the trees, sending water cascading down from the leaves. 

“Now tell us what happened to you,” Brad said. “Agatha and I really were 
terribly upset that you were out in this storm.” 

“It’s kind of a long story,” I told them, warming my hands on the hot cider 
mug. “I don’t know where to start.” 

“Start at the beginning,” Brad said quietly. “That’s usually the best place.” 

Terri and I did our best to tell them the whole story of the three ghostly 
kids, the old man, and the frightening cave. As we talked, I could see their 
expressions changing. 

I could see how worried they were for Terri and me. And I could see how 
unhappy they were that we had ignored their wishes and ventured into the cave. 

When I finished the story, the room grew quiet. Brad stared out the window 
at the dripping rainwater on the glass. Agatha cleared her throat, but didn’t 
speak. 

“We’re really sorry,” Terri said, breaking the silence. “I hope you’re not 
angry at us.” 

“The important thing is that you’re both safe and sound,” Agatha replied. 

She stood up, stepped over to Terri, and gave her a warm hug. 

Agatha started toward me, her arms outstretched—when a sound outside 
made her stop. 

Barking. Loud dog barking. 

Terri lunged for the back door and pulled it open. “Jerry—look!” she cried. 
“It’s Harrison Sadler’s dog. He got out of the cave. He must have followed us 
here.” 

I moved to the open doorway. The dog had been drenched in the rain. Its 



wet gray fur was matted to its back. 

Terri and I reached out to pet the dog. 

But to our surprise, it reared back and growled. 

“Easy, boy,” I said. “You must be really frightened, huh?” 

The dog snarled at me and started to bark. 

Terri bent down and tried to soothe the animal. But it backed away from 
her, barking ferociously. 

“Whoa!” I cried. “I’m your friend—remember? I’m no ghost!” 

Terri turned to me, her expression puzzled. “You’re right. We’re not ghosts. 
Why is it carrying on like that?” 

I shrugged. “Whoa. Easy, boy. Easy.” 

The dog ignored my pleas, barking and howling. 

I turned back to see Brad and Agatha huddled against the kitchen wall, their 
faces tight with fear. 

“That’s only Brad and Agatha,” I told the dog. “They’re nice people. They 
won’t hurt you.” 

And then I swallowed hard. My heart began to throb. 

I realized why the dog was barking like that. He was barking at Brad and 
Agatha. 

Agatha stepped into the doorway, shaking her finger at the snarling animal. 
“Bad dog!” she cried. “Bad dog! Now you’ve given away our secret, too!” 

Terri gasped. She realized what Agatha was saying. 

Agatha slammed the kitchen door hard and turned back to Brad. “What a 
pity that dog had to show up,” she said, shaking her head fretfully. “Now what 
do we do with these two kids, Brad? What do we do with the kids?”

RETURN OF 
THE MUMMY 


Goosebumps - 23 
R.L. Stine 





1 


“Gabe, we will be landing soon,” the stewardess told me, leaning over the 
seat. “Will someone be meeting you at the airport?” 

“Yes. Probably an ancient Egyptian pharaoh,” I told her. “Or maybe a 
disgusting, decaying mummy.” 

She narrowed her eyes at me. “No. Really,” she insisted. “Who will be 
meeting you in Cairo?” 

“My Uncle Ben,” I replied. “But he likes to play practical jokes. 
Sometimes he dresses in weird costumes and tries to scare me.” 

“You told me that your uncle was a famous scientist,” the stewardess 

said. 

“He is,” I replied. “But he’s also weird.” 

She laughed. I liked her a lot. She had pretty blond hair. And I liked 
the way she always tilted her head to one side when she talked. 

Her name was Nancy, and she had been very nice to me during the 
long flight to Egypt. She knew it was my first time flying all by myself. 

She kept checking on me and asking me how I was doing. But she 
treated me like a grown-up. She didn’t bring me one of those dumb 
connect-the-dots books or a plastic wings pin that they always give to kids 
on planes. And she kept slipping me extra bags of peanuts, even though she 
wasn’t supposed to. 

“Why are you visiting your uncle?” Nancy asked. “Just for fun?” 

I nodded. “I did it last summer, too,” I told her. “It was really 
awesome! But this year, Uncle Ben has been digging in an unexplored 
pyramid. He’s discovered an ancient, sacred tomb. And he invited me to be 
with him when he opens it up.” 

She laughed and tilted her head a little more. “You have a good 
imagination, Gabe,” she said. Then she turned away to answer a man’s 
question. 

I do have a good imagination. But I wasn’t making that up. 

My Uncle Ben Hassad is a famous archaeologist. He has been digging 
around in pyramids for lots of years. I’ve seen newspaper articles about 
him. And once he was in National Geographic. 



Last summer, my entire family visited Cairo. My cousin Sari and I— 
she’s Uncle Ben’s daughter—had some amazing adventures down in the 
chambers of the Great Pyramid. 

Sari will be there this summer, too, I remembered, staring out the plane 
window at the solid blue sky. I wondered if maybe she would give me a 
break this time. 

I like Sari, but she’s so competitive! She always has to be the first, the 
strongest, the smartest, the best. She’s the only thirteen-year-old girl I know 
who can turn eating breakfast into a contest! 

“Flight attendants, prepare for landing,” the pilot announced over the 
loudspeaker. 

I sat up to get a better view out the window. As the plane lowered, I 
could see the city of Cairo beneath us. A slender blue ribbon curled along 
the city. That, I knew, was the Nile River. 

The city stretched out from the river. Peering straight down, I could 
see tall, glass skyscrapers and low, domed temples. Where the city ended, 
the desert began. Yellow sand stretched to the horizon. 

My stomach began to feel a little fluttery. The pyramids were 
somewhere out in that desert. And in a day or two, I would be climbing 
down into one of them, following my uncle into a tomb that hadn’t been 
opened for thousands of years. 

What would we find? 

I pulled the little mummy hand from my shirt pocket and gazed down 
at it. It was so tiny—no bigger than a child’s hand. I had bought it from a 
kid at a garage sale for two dollars. He said it was called a “Summoner.” He 
said it could summon ancient evil spirits. 

It looked like a mummy hand. The fingers were wrapped in stained 
gauze bandages, with a little black tar showing through. 

I thought it was a fake, made of rubber or plastic. I mean, I never 
thought it was a real mummy hand. 

But last summer, the hand had saved all of our lives. The kid who sold 
it to me was right. It really did bring a bunch of mummies to life! It was 
amazing ! 

Of course my parents and my friends back home didn’t believe my 
incredible story And they didn’t believe that the Summoner really worked. 
They said it was just a joke mummy hand made in some souvenir factory 



Probably made in Taiwan. 

But I carry it with me wherever I go. It is my good luck charm. I’m not 
very superstitious. I mean, I walk under ladders all the time. And my lucky 
number is thirteen. 

But I really do believe that the little mummy hand will protect me. 

The strange thing about the mummy hand is that it is always warm. It 
doesn’t feel like plastic. It feels warm, like a real human hand. 

Back home in Michigan, I had a major panic attack when Mom and 
Dad were packing my suitcase for the flight. I couldn’t find the mummy 
hand. And, of course, there was no way I would go to Egypt without it! 

I was so relieved when I finally found it. It was tucked into the back 
pocket of a crumpled-up pair of jeans. 

Now, as the plane nosed down for a landing, I reached for the hand in 
the pocket of my T-shirt. I pulled it out—and gasped. 

The hand was cold. Cold as ice! 



2 


Why had the mummy hand suddenly turned cold? 

Was it some kind of a message? A warning? 

Was I heading into danger? 

I didn’t have time to think about it. The plane rolled into the gate, and 
the passengers were scrambling to pull down their carry-on bags and push 
their way out of the plane. 

I tucked the mummy hand into my jeans pocket, hoisted up my 
backpack, and headed to the front. I said good-bye to Nancy and thanked 
her for all the peanuts. Then I followed the others down the long, covered 
ramp and into the airport. 

So many people! 

And they all seemed to be in a hurry. They were practically stepping 
over each other. Men in dark business suits. Women in loose-flowing robes, 
their faces covered by veils. Teenage girls in jeans and T-shirts. A group of 
dark, serious-looking men in silky white suits that looked like pajamas. A 
family with three little kids, all crying. 

I had a sudden sinking feeling. How would I ever find Uncle Ben in 
this crowd? 

My backpack began to feel very heavy. My eyes frantically searched 
back and forth. Strange voices surrounded me, all talking so loudly. No one 
was speaking English. 

“Ow!” I cried out as I felt a sharp pain in my side. 

I turned and realized that a woman had bumped me with her luggage 

cart. 

Stay calm, Gabe, I instructed myself. Just stay calm. 

Uncle Ben is here, looking for you. He’ll find you. You just have to 
stay calm. 

But what if my uncle forgot? I asked myself. What if he got mixed up 
about what day I was arriving? Or what if he got busy down in the pyramid 
and lost track of the time? 

I can be a real worrier if I put my mind to it. 

And right now I was worrying enough for three people! 



If Uncle Ben isn’t here, I’ll go to a phone and call him, I decided. 

For sure. 

I could just hear myself saying, “Operator, can I speak to my uncle at 
the pyramids, please?” 

I don’t think that would work too well. 

I didn’t have a phone number for Uncle Ben. I wasn’t sure he even had 
a phone out where he was staying. All I knew was that he had been living in 
a tent somewhere near the pyramid where he was digging. 

Gazing frantically around the crowded arrival area, I was just about to 
give in to total panic—when a large man came walking up to me. 

I couldn’t see his face. He wore a long, white, hooded robe. It’s called 
a burnoose. And his face was buried inside the hood. 

“Taxi?” he asked in a high, shrill voice. “Taxi? American taxi?” 

I burst out laughing. “Uncle Ben!” I cried happily. 

“Taxi? American taxi? Taxi ride?” he insisted. 

“Uncle Ben! I’m so glad to see you!” I exclaimed. I threw my arms 
around his waist and gave him a big hug. Then, laughing at his stupid 
disguise, I reached up and pulled back his hood. 

The man under the hood had a bald, shaved head and a heavy black 
mustache. He glared at me furiously. 

I had never seen him before in my life.

“Gabe! Gabe! Over here!” 

I heard a voice calling my name. Glancing past the angry man, I saw 
Uncle Ben and Sari. They were waving to me from in front of the 
reservations counter. 

The man’s face turned bright red, and he shouted something at me in 
Arabic. I was glad I couldn’t understand him. He kept muttering as he 
pulled up the hood of his burnoose. 

“Sorry about that!” I cried. Then I dodged past him and hurried to 
greet Uncle Ben and my cousin. 

Uncle Ben shook my hand and said, “Welcome to Cairo, Gabe.” He 
was wearing a loose-fitting, white, short-sleeved sportshirt and baggy 
chinos. 

Sari wore faded denim cutoffs and a bright green tank top. She was 
already laughing at me. A bad start. “Was that a friend of yours?” she 
teased. 

“I—I made a mistake,” I confessed. I glanced back. The man was still 
scowling at me. 

“Did you really think that was Daddy?” Sari demanded. 

I mumbled a reply. Sari and I were the same age. But I saw that she 
was still an inch taller than me. She had let her black hair grow. It fell down 
her back in a single braid. 

Her big, dark eyes sparkled excitedly. She loved making fun of me. 

I told them about my flight as we walked to the baggage area to get my 
suitcase. I told them how Nancy, the stewardess, kept slipping me bags of 
peanuts. 

“I flew here last week,” Sari told me. “The stewardess let me sit in 
First Class. Did you know you can have an ice-cream sundae in First 
Class?” 

No, I didn’t know that. I could see that Sari hadn’t changed a bit. 

She goes to a boarding school in Chicago since Uncle Ben has been 
spending all of his time in Egypt. Of course she gets straight A’s. And she’s 
a champion skier and tennis player. 



Sometimes I feel a little sorry for her. Her mom died when Sari was 
five. And Sari only gets to see her dad on holidays and during the summer. 

But as we waited for my suitcase to come out on the conveyor belt, I 
wasn’t feeling sorry for her at all. She was busy bragging about how this 
pyramid was twice as big as the one I’d been in last summer. And how 
she’d already been down in it several times, and how she’d take me on a 
tour—if I wasn’t too afraid. 

Finally, my bulging, blue suitcase appeared. I lugged it off the 
conveyor and dropped it at my feet. It weighed a ton! 

I tried to lift it, but I could barely budge it. 

Sari pushed me out of the way. “Let me get that,” she insisted. She 
grabbed the handle, raised the suitcase off the floor, and started off with it. 

“Hey—!” I called after her. What a show-off! 

Uncle Ben grinned at me. “I think Sari has been working out,” he said. 
He put a hand on my shoulder and led me toward the glass doors. “Let’s get 
to the jeep.” 

We loaded the suitcase into the back of the jeep, then headed toward the 
city. “It’s been sweltering hot during the day,” Uncle Ben told me, mopping 
his broad forehead with a handkerchief. “And then cool at night.” 

Traffic crawled on the narrow street. Horns honked constantly. Drivers 
kept their horns going whether they moved or stopped. The noise was 
deafening. 

“We’re not stopping in Cairo,” Uncle Ben explained. “We’re going 
straight to the pyramid at Al-Jizah. We’re all living in tents out there so we 
can be close to our work.” 

“I hope you brought bug spray,” Sari complained. “The mosquitoes are 
as big as frogs!” 

“Don’t exaggerate,” Uncle Ben scolded. “Gabe isn’t afraid of a few 
mosquitoes—are you?” 

“No way,” I replied quietly. 

“How about scorpions?” Sari demanded. 

The traffic grew lighter as we left the city behind and headed into the 
desert. The yellow sand gleamed under the hot afternoon sun. Waves of 
heat rose up in front of us as the jeep bumped over the narrow, two-lane 
road. 



Before long, a pyramid came into view. Behind the waves of heat off 
the desert floor, it looked like a wavering mirage. It didn’t seem real. 

As I stared out at it, my throat tightened with excitement. I had seen 
the pyramids last summer. But it was still a thrilling sight. 

“I can’t believe the pyramids are over four thousand years old!” I 
exclaimed. 

“Yeah. That’s even older than me!” Uncle Ben joked. His expression 
turned serious. “It fills me with pride every time I see them, Gabe,” he 
admitted. “To think that our ancient ancestors were smart enough and 
skilled enough to build these marvels.” 

Uncle Ben was right. I guess the pyramids have special meaning for 
me since my family is Egyptian. Both sets of my grandparents came from 
Egypt. They moved to the United States around 1930. My mom and dad 
were born in Michigan. 

I think of myself as a typical American kid. But there’s still something 
exciting about visiting the country where your ancestors came from. 

As we drove nearer, the pyramid appeared to rise up in front of us. Its 
shadow formed a long, blue triangle over the yellow sand. 

Cars and tour buses jammed a small parking lot. I could see a row of 
saddled camels tethered on one side of the lot. A crowd of tourists stretched 
across the sand, gazing up at the pyramid, snapping photographs, chatting 
noisily and pointing. 

Uncle Ben turned the jeep onto a narrow side road, and we headed 
away from the crowd, toward the back of the pyramid. As we drove into the 
shade, the air suddenly felt cooler. 

“I’d kill for an ice-cream cone!” Sari wailed. “I’ve never been so hot in 
my life.” 

“Let’s not talk about the heat,” Uncle Ben replied, sweat dripping 
down his forehead into his bushy eyebrows. “Let’s talk about how happy 
you are to see your father after so many months.” 

Sari groaned. “I’d be happier to see you if you were carrying an ice¬ 
cream cone.” 

Uncle Ben laughed. 

A khaki-uniformed guard stepped in front of the jeep. Uncle Ben held 
up a blue ID card. The guard waved us past. 

As we followed the road behind the pyramid, a row of low, white 



canvas tents came into view. “Welcome to the Pyramid Hilton!” Uncle Ben 
joked. “That’s our luxury suite over there.” He pointed to the nearest tent. 

“It’s pretty comfortable,” he said, parking the jeep beside the tent. “But 
the room service is lousy.” 

“And you have to watch out for scorpions,” Sari warned. 

She’d say anything to try to scare me. 

We unloaded my suitcase. Then Uncle Ben led us up to the base of the 
pyramid. 

A camera crew was packing up its equipment. A young man, covered 
in dust, climbed out of a low entrance dug into one of the limestone 
squares. He waved to my uncle, then hurried toward the tents. 

“One of my people,” Uncle Ben muttered. He motioned toward the 
pyramid. “Well, here you are, Gabe. Along way from Michigan, huh?” 

I nodded. “It’s amazing,” I told him, shielding my eyes to gaze up to 
the top. “I forgot how much bigger the pyramids look in person.” 

“Tomorrow I’ll take you both down to the tomb,” Uncle Ben promised. 
“You’ve come at just the right time. We’ve been digging for months and 
months. And at long last, we are about to break the seal and enter the tomb 
itself.” 

“Wow!” I exclaimed. I wanted to be cool in front of Sari. But I 
couldn’t help it. I was really excited. 

“Guess you’ll be really famous after you open the tomb, huh, Dad?” 
Sari asked. She swatted a fly on her arm. “Ow!” 

“I’ll be so famous, the flies will be afraid to bite you,” Uncle Ben 
replied. “By the way, do you know what they called flies in ancient Egypt?” 

Sari and I shook our heads no. 

“I don’t either!” Uncle Ben said, grinning. One of his dumb jokes. He 
had an endless supply of them. His expression suddenly changed. “Oh. That 
reminds me. I have a present for you, Gabe.” 

“A present?” 

“Now, where did I put it?” He dug both hands into the pockets of his 
baggy chinos. 

As he searched, I saw something move behind him. A shadow over my 
uncle’s shoulder, back at the low opening to the pyramid. 

I squinted at it. 

The shadow moved. A figure stepped out slowly. 



At first I thought the sun was playing tricks on my eyes. 

But as I squinted harder, I realized that I was seeing correctly. 

The figure stepped out from the pyramid—its face was covered in 
worn, yellowed gauze. So were its arms. And its legs. 

I opened my mouth to cry out—but my voice choked in my throat. 

And as I struggled to alert my uncle, the mummy stiffly stretched out 
its arms and came staggering up behind him.

I saw Sari’s eyes grow wide with fright. She let out a low gasp. 

“Uncle Ben—!” I finally managed to scream. “Turn around! It—it—!” 

My uncle narrowed his eyes at me, confused. 

The mummy staggered closer, its hands reaching out menacingly, 
about to grab the back of Uncle Ben’s neck. 

“A mummy\” I shrieked. 

Uncle Ben spun around. He let out a startled cry. “It walks!” he 
shouted, pointing at the mummy with a trembling finger. He backed away 
as the mummy advanced. “It walks!” 

“Ohhh.” A strange moan escaped Sari’s lips. 

I turned and started to run. 

But then the mummy burst out laughing. 

It lowered its yellowed arms. “Boo!” it cried, and laughed again. 

I turned and saw that Uncle Ben was laughing, too. His dark eyes 
sparkled gleefully. “It walks! It walks!” he repeated, shaking his head. He 
put his arm around the mummy’s shoulder. 

I gaped at the two of them, my heart still pounding. 

“This is John,” Uncle Ben said, enjoying the joke he’d pulled on us. 
“He’s been doing a TV commercial here. For some new kind of stickier 
bandage.” 

“Sticky Bird Bandages,” John told us. “They’re just what your 
mummy ordered!” 

He and Uncle Ben enjoyed another good laugh at that. Then my uncle 
pointed to the camera crew, packing their equipment into a small van. 
“They finished for the day. But John agreed to hang around and help me 
scare you.” 

Sari rolled her eyes. “Nice try,” she said dryly. “You’ll have to do 
better than that, Daddy, to frighten me.” And then she added, “Poor Gabe. 
Did you see his face? He was so freaked out! I thought he was going to 
spontaneously combust or something!” 

Uncle Ben and John laughed. 

“Hey—no way!” I insisted, feeling my face turn red. 



How could Sari say that? When the mummy staggered out, I saw her 
gasp and back away. She was just as scared as I was! 

“I heard you scream, too!” I told her. I didn’t mean to sound so whiny. 

“I just did that to help them scare you,” Sari insisted. She tossed her 
long braid over her shoulder. 

“I’ve got to run,” John said, glancing at his wristwatch. “As soon as 
we get back to the hotel, I’m going to hit the pool. I may stay underwater 
for a week!” He gave us a wave of his bandaged hand and went jogging to 
the van. 

Why hadn’t I noticed that he was wearing a wristwatch? 

I felt like a total dork. “That’s it!” I cried angrily to my uncle. “I’m 
never falling for one of your dumb jokes again! Never!” 

He grinned at me and winked. “Want to bet?” 

“What about Gabe’s present?” Sari asked. “What is it?” 

Uncle Ben pulled something out of his pocket and held it up. A 
pendant on a string. Made of clear orange glass. It gleamed in the bright 
sunlight. 

He handed it to me. I moved it in my hand, feeling its smoothness as I 
examined it. “What is it?” I asked him. “What kind of glass is this?” 

“It isn’t glass,” he replied. “It’s a clear stone called amber.” He stepped 
closer to examine it along with me. “Hold it up and look inside the 
pendant.” 

I followed his instructions. I saw a large brown bug inside. “It looks 
like some kind of beetle,” I said. 

“It is a beetle,” Uncle Ben said, squinting one eye to see it better. “It’s 
an ancient beetle called a scarab. It was trapped in the amber four thousand 
years ago. As you can see, it’s perfectly preserved.” 

“That’s really gross,” Sari commented, making a face. She slapped 
Uncle Ben on the back. “Great gift, Dad. A dead bug. Remind me not to let 
you do our Christmas shopping!” 

Uncle Ben laughed. Then he turned back to me. “The scarab was very 
important to the ancient Egyptians,” he said, rolling the amber pendant in 
his fingers, then dropping it back in my palm. “They believed that scarabs 
were a symbol of immortality.” 

I stared at the bug’s dark shell, its six prickly legs, perfectly preserved. 

“To keep a scarab meant immortality,” my uncle continued. “But the 



bite of a scarab meant instant death.” 

“Weird.” Sari muttered. 

“It’s great-looking,” I told him. “Is it really four thousand years old?” 
He nodded. “Wear it around your neck, Gabe. Maybe it still has some 
of its ancient powers.” 

I slipped the pendant over my head and adjusted it under my T-shirt. 
The amber stone felt cool against my skin. “Thanks, Uncle Ben,” I said. 
“It’s a great present.” 

He mopped his sweaty forehead with a wadded-up handkerchief. 
“Let’s go back to the tent and get something cold to drink,” he said. 

We took a few steps—and then stopped when we saw Sari’s face. 

Her entire body trembled. Her mouth dropped open as she pointed to 
my chest. 

“Sari—what is it?” Uncle Ben cried. 

“The s-scarab—” she stammered. “It... escaped! I saw it!” She pointed 
down. “It’s there!” 

“Huh?” I spun away from her and bent down to find the scarab. 

“Ow!” I cried out when I felt a sharp stab of pain on the back of my 
leg. 

And realized the scarab had bitten me.

As I gasped in alarm, Uncle Ben’s words about the scarab rushed through 
my mind. 

“To keep a scarab meant immortality. But the bite of a scarab meant 
instant death. ” 

Instant death ? 

“Noooo!” I let out a howl and spun around. 

And saw Sari hunched down on her knees. Grinning. Her hand 
outstretched. 

And realized she had pinched my leg. 

My heart still pounding, I grabbed the pendant and stared into the 
orange glassy stone. The scarab was still frozen inside, just as it had been 
for four thousand years. 

“Aaaaaaaggh!” I let out a howl of rage. I was mostly furious at myself. 

Was I going to fall for every dumb joke Uncle Ben and Sari played on 
me this trip? If so, it was going to be a very long summer. 

I had always liked my cousin. Except for the times when she was 
being so competitive and so superior, we always got along really well. 

But now I wanted to punch her. I wanted to say really nasty things to 
her. 

But I couldn’t think of anything nasty enough. 

“That was really mean, Sari,” I said glumly, tucking the pendant under 
my T-shirt. 

“Yes, it was— wasn’t it!” she replied, very pleased with herself. 

That night, I lay on my back on my narrow cot, staring up at the low tent 
roof, listening. Listening to the brush of the wind against the tent door, the 
soft creak of the tent poles, the flap of the canvas. 

I don’t think I’d ever felt so alert. 

Turning my head, I could see the pale glow of moonlight through a 
crack in the tent door. I could see blades of dried desert grass on the sand 
outside. I could see water stains on the tent wall over my bed. 

I’ll never get to sleep, I thought unhappily. 



I pushed and punched the flat pillow for the twentieth time, trying to 
fluff it up. The harsh wool blanket felt scratchy against my chin. 

I’d slept away from home before. But I’d always slept in a room of 
some kind. Not in the middle of a vast, sandy desert in a tiny, flapping, 
creaking, canvas tent. 

I wasn’t scared. My uncle lay snoring away in his cot a few feet across 
the tent. 

I was just alert. Very, very alert. 

So alert I could hear the swish of palm trees outside. And I could hear 
the low hum of car tires miles away on the narrow road. 

And I heard the thudding of my heart when something wriggled on my 
chest. 

I was so alert. I felt it instantly. 

Just a tickle. A quick, light move. 

It could only be one thing. The scarab moving inside the amber 
pendant. 

No joke this time. 

No joke. It moved. 

I fumbled for the pendant in the dark, tossing down the blanket. I held 
it up to the moonlight. I could see the fat beetle in there, black in its orange 
prison. 

“Did you move?” I whispered to it. “Did you wriggle your legs?” 

I suddenly felt really stupid. Why was I whispering to a four-thousand- 
year-old insect? Why was I imagining that it was alive? 

Annoyed with myself, I tucked the pendant back under my nightshirt. 

I had no way of knowing how important that pendant would soon 
become to me. 

I had no way of knowing that the pendant held a secret that would 
either save my life. Or kill me.

The tent was already hot when I awoke the next morning. Bright yellow 
sunlight poured in through the open tent flap. Squinting against the light, I 
mbbed my eyes and stretched. Uncle Ben had already gone out. 

My back ached. The little cot was so hard! 

But I was too excited to worry about my back. I was going down into 
the pyramid this morning, to the entrance of an ancient tomb. 

I pulled on a clean T-shirt and the jeans I’d worn the day before. I 
adjusted the scarab pendant under the T-shirt. Then I carefully tucked the 
little mummy hand into the back pocket of my jeans. With the pendant and 
the mummy hand, I’m well protected, I told myself. Nothing bad can 
happen this trip. 

I pulled a hairbrush through my thick, black hair a few times, tugged 
my black-and-yellow Michigan Wolverines cap on. Then I hurried to the 
mess tent to get some breakfast. 

The sun was floating above the palm trees in the distance. The yellow 
desert sand gleamed brightly. I took a deep breath of fresh air. 

Yuck. There must be some camels nearby, I decided. The air wasn’t 
exactly fresh. 

I found Sari and Uncle Ben having their breakfast, seated at the end of 
the long table in the mess tent. Uncle Ben wore his usual baggy chinos and 
a short-sleeved, white sportshirt with coffee stains down the front. 

Sari had her long, black hair pulled straight back in a ponytail. She 
wore a bright red tank top over white tennis shorts. 

They greeted me as I entered the tent. I poured myself a glass of 
orange juice and, since I didn’t see any Frosted Flakes, filled a bowl with 
Raisin Bran. 

Three of Uncle Ben’s workers were eating at the other end of the table. 
They were talking excitedly about their work. “We could go in today,” I 
heard one of them say. 

“It might take days to break the seal on the tomb door,” a young 
woman replied. 

I sat down next to Sari. “Tell me all about the tomb,” I said to Uncle 



Ben. “Whose tomb is it? What’s in there?” 

He chuckled. “Let me say good morning before I launch into a 
lecture.” 

Sari leaned over my cereal bowl. “Hey, look—” she said, pointing. “I 
got a lot more raisins than you did!” 

I told you she could turn breakfast into a contest. 

“Well, I got more pulp in my orange juice,” I replied. 

It was just a joke, but she checked her juice glass to make sure. 

Uncle Ben wiped his mouth with a paper napkin. He took a long sip of 
black coffee. “If I’m not mistaken,” he began, “the tomb we have 
discovered here belonged to a prince. Actually, a cousin of King 
Tutankhamen.” 

“That’s King Tut,” Sari told me, interrupting. 

“I know that!” I replied sharply. 

“King Tut’s tomb was discovered in 1922,” Uncle Ben continued. 
“The vast burial chamber was filled with most of Tut’s treasures. It was the 
most amazing archaeological discovery of the century.” A smile crossed his 
face. “Until now.” 

“Do you think you’ve found something even more amazing?” I asked. 
I hadn’t touched my cereal. I was too interested in my uncle’s story. 

He shrugged. “There’s no way of knowing what’s behind the tomb 
door until we open it, Gabe. But I have my fingers crossed. I believe we’ve 
found the burial chamber of Prince Khor-Ru. He was the king’s cousin. And 
he was said to be as wealthy as the king.” 

“And do you think all of Prince Khor-Ru’s crowns, and jewels, and 
belongings are buried with him?” Sari asked. 

Uncle Ben took the last sip of coffee and slid the white mug across the 
table. “Who knows?” he replied. “There could be amazing treasures in 
there. Or it could be empty. Just an empty room.” 

“How could it be empty?” I demanded. “Why would there be an empty 
tomb in the pyramids?” 

“Grave robbers,” Uncle Ben replied, frowning. “Remember, Prince 
Khor-Ru was buried sometime around 1300 B.C. Over the centuries, 
thieves broke into the pyramids and robbed the treasures from many burial 
chambers.” 

He stood up and sighed. “We may have been digging for all these 



months only to find an empty room.” 

“No way!” I cried excitedly. “I’ll bet we find the Prince’s mummy in 
there. And millions of dollars’ worth of jewels!” 

Uncle Ben smiled at me. “Enough talk,” he said. “Finish your 
breakfast so we can go find out.” 

Sari and I followed Uncle Ben out of the tent. 

He waved to two young men who came out of the supply tent carrying 
digging equipment. Then he hurried over to talk to them. 

Sari and I lingered back. She turned to me, a serious expression on her 
face. “Hey, Gabe,” she said softly, “sorry I’ve been such a pain.” 

“You? A pain?” I replied sarcastically. 

She didn’t laugh. “I’m kind of worried,” she confessed. “About 
Daddy.” 

I glanced at Uncle Ben. He was slapping one of the young men on the 
back as he talked. His usual jolly self. 

“Why are you worried?” I asked Sari. “Your dad is in a great mood.” 

“That’s why I’m worried,” Sari whispered. “He’s so happy and 
excited. He really thinks this is going to be the discovery that makes him 
famous.” 

“So?” I demanded. 

“So what if it turns out to be an empty room?” Sari replied, her dark 
eyes watching her father. “What if grave robbers did strip the place? Or 
what if it isn’t that prince’s tomb after all? What if Daddy breaks the seal, 
opens the door—and finds nothing but a dusty, old room filled with 
snakes?” 

She sighed. “Daddy will be heartbroken. Just heartbroken. He’s 
counting on this so much, Gabe. I don’t know if he’ll be able to take the 
disappointment.” 

“Why look on the gloomy side?” I replied. “What if—” 

I stopped because Uncle Ben was hurrying back to us. “Let’s go down 
to the chamber,” he said excitedly. “The workers think we are very close to 
uncovering the tomb entrance.” 

He put an arm on each of our shoulders and guided us to the pyramid. 

As we stepped into the shade of the pyramid, the air grew cooler. The 
low entrance dug at the bottom of the back wall came into view. It was just 
big enough for us to enter one at a time. Peering into the narrow hole, I saw 



that the tunnel dropped steeply. 

I hope I don’t fall, I thought, a heavy knot of fear tightening my 
stomach. I pictured myself falling and falling down an endless, dark hole. 

Mainly, I didn’t want to fall in front of Sari. I knew she’d never let me 
forget it. 

Uncle Ben handed Sari and me bright yellow hard hats. They had 
lights built into them, like miners’ hats. “Stick close together,” he 
instructed. “I remember last summer. You two wandered off and got us into 
a lot of trouble.” 

“W-we won’t,” I stammered. I was trying not to sound nervous, but I 
couldn’t help it. 

I glanced at Sari. She was adjusting the yellow hard hat over her hair. 
She seemed as calm and confident as ever. 

“I’ll lead the way,” Uncle Ben said, pulling the chin strap under his 
chin. He turned and started to lower himself into the hole. 

But a shrill cry from behind us made us all stop and turn around. 

“Stop! Please—stop! Don’t go in!”

A young woman came running across the sand. Her long, black hair flew 
behind her head as she ran. She carried a brown briefcase in one hand. A 
camera, strapped around her neck, bobbed in front of her. 

She stopped in front of us and smiled at Uncle Ben. “Dr. Hassad?” she 
asked breathlessly. 

My uncle nodded. “Yes?” He waited for her to catch her breath. 

Wow. She’s really pretty, I thought. She had long, black hair, sleek and 
shiny. She had bangs cut straight across her forehead. Beneath the bangs 
were the most beautiful green eyes I’d ever seen. 

She was dressed all in white. A white suit jacket and a white blouse 
over white slacks. She was short—only an inch or two taller than Sari. 

She must be a movie star or something, I told myself. She’s so great¬ 
looking! 

She set her briefcase down on the sand and brushed back her long, 
black hair. “I’m sorry I shouted like that, Dr. Hassad,” she told my uncle. 
“It’s just that I needed to talk to you. I didn’t want you to disappear into the 
pyramid.” 

Uncle Ben narrowed his eyes at her, studying her. “How did you get 
past the security guard?” he asked, pulling off the hard hat. 

“I showed them my press card,” she replied. “I’m a reporter for the 
Cairo Sun. My name is Nila Rahmad. I was hoping—” 

“Nila?” Uncle Ben interrupted. “What a pretty name.” 

She smiled. “Yes. My mother named me after the River of Life, the 
Nile.” 

“Well, it’s a very pretty name,” Uncle Ben replied. His eyes twinkled. 
“But I’m not ready to have any reporters write about our work here.” 

Nila frowned and bit her lower lip. “I spoke to Dr. Fielding a few days 
ago,” she said. 

My uncle’s eyes widened in surprise. “You did?” 

“Dr. Fielding gave me permission to write about your discovery,” Nila 
insisted, her green eyes locked on my uncle. 

“Well, we haven’t discovered anything yet!” Uncle Ben said sharply. 



“There may not be anything to discover.” 

“That’s not what Dr. Fielding told me,” Nila replied. “He seemed 
confident that you were about to make a discovery that would shock the 
world.” 

Uncle Ben laughed. “Sometimes my partner gets excited and talks too 
much,” he told Nila. 

Nila’s eyes pleaded with my uncle. “May I come into the pyramid with 
you?” She glanced at Sari and me. “I see you have other visitors.” 

“My daughter, Sari, and my nephew, Gabe,” Uncle Ben replied. 

“Well, could I come down with them?” Nila pleaded. “I promise I 
won’t write a word for my paper until you give me permission.” 

Uncle Ben rubbed his chin thoughtfully. He swung the hard hat back 
onto his head. “No photographs, either,” he muttered. 

“Does that mean I can come?” Nila asked excitedly. 

Uncle Ben nodded. “As an observer.” He was trying to act real tough. 
But I could see he liked her. 

Nila flashed him a warm smile. “Thank you, Dr. Hassad.” 

He reached into the storage cart and handed her a yellow hard hat. “We 
won’t be making any amazing discoveries today,” he warned her. “But 
we’re getting very close—to something.” 

As she slipped on the heavy helmet, Nila turned to Sari and me. “Is 
this your first time in the pyramid?” she asked. 

“No way. I’ve already been down three times,” Sari boasted. “It’s 
really awesome.” 

“I just arrived yesterday,” I said. “So it’s my first time down in—” 

I stopped when I saw Nila’s expression change. 

Why was she staring at me like that? 

I glanced down and realized that she was staring at the amber pendant. 
Her mouth was open in shock. 

“No! I don’t believe this! I really don’t! This is so weird!” she 
exclaimed.

“Wh-what’s wrong?” I stammered. 

“We’re twins'.” Nila declared. She reached under her suit jacket and 
pulled out a pendant she wore around her neck. 

An amber pendant, shaped exactly like mine. 

“How unusual!” Uncle Ben exclaimed. 

Nila grasped my pendant between her fingers and lowered her face to 
examine it. “You have a scarab inside yours,” she told me, turning the 
pendant around in her fingers. 

She dropped mine and held hers up for me to see. “Look, Gabe. Mine 
is empty.” 

I gazed into her pendant. It looked like clear orange glass. Nothing 
inside. 

“I think yours is prettier,” Sari told Nila. “I wouldn’t want to wear a 
dead bug around my neck.” 

“But it’s supposed to be good luck or something,” Nila replied. She 
tucked the pendant back under her white jacket. “I hope it isn’t bad luck to 
have an empty one!” 

“I hope so, too,” Uncle Ben commented dryly. He turned and led us 
into the pyramid opening. 

I’m not really sure how I got lost. 

Sari and I were walking together behind Uncle Ben and Nila. We were 
close behind them. I could hear my uncle explaining about how the tunnel 
walls were granite and limestone. 

Our helmet lights were on. The narrow beams of yellow light darted 
and crisscrossed over the dusty tunnel floor and walls as we made our way 
deeper and deeper into the pyramid. 

The ceiling hung low, and we all had to stoop as we walked. The 
tunnel kept curving, and there were several smaller tunnels that branched 
off. “False starts and dead ends,” Uncle Ben called them. 

It was hard to see in the flickering light from our helmets. I stumbled 
once and scraped my elbow against the rough tunnel wall. It was 



surprisingly cool down here, and I wished I had worn a sweatshirt or 
something. 

Up ahead, Uncle Ben was telling Nila about King Tut and Prince 
Khor-Ru. It sounded to me as if Uncle Ben was trying to impress her. I 
wondered if he had a crush on her or something. 

“This is so thrilling!” I heard Nila exclaim. “It was so nice of Dr. 
Fielding and you to let me see it.” 

“Who is Dr. Fielding?” I whispered to Sari. 

“My father’s partner,” Sari whispered back. “But Daddy doesn’t like 
him. You’ll probably meet him. He’s always around. I don’t like him much, 
either.” 

I stopped to examine a strange-looking marking on the tunnel wall. It 
was shaped like some kind of animal head. “Sari—look!” I whispered. “An 
ancient drawing.” 

Sari rolled her eyes. “It’s Bart Simpson,” she muttered. “One of 
Daddy’s workers must have drawn it there.” 

“I knew that!” I lied. “I was just testing you.” 

When was I going to stop making a fool of myself in front of my 
cousin? 

I turned back from the stupid drawing on the wall—and Sari had 
vanished. 

I could see the narrow beam of light from her hard hat up ahead. “Hey 
—wait up!” I called. But the light disappeared as the tunnel curved away. 

And then I stumbled again. 

My helmet hit the tunnel wall. And the light went out. 

“Hey—Sari? Uncle Ben?” I called to them. I leaned heavily against the 
wall, afraid to move in the total darkness. 

“Hey—! Can anybody hear me?” My voice echoed down the narrow 
tunnel. 

But no one replied. 

I pulled off the hard hat and fiddled with the light. I turned it, trying to 
tighten it. Then I shook the whole hat. But the light wouldn’t come back on. 

Sighing, I strapped the hat back onto my head. 

Now what? I thought, starting to feel a little afraid. My stomach began 
fluttering. My throat suddenly felt dry. 

“Hey—can anybody hear me?” I shouted. “I’m in the dark back here. I 



can’t walk!” 

No reply. 

Where were they? Didn’t they notice that I had disappeared? 
“Well, I’ll just wait right here for them,” I murmured to myself. 
I leaned my shoulder against the tunnel wall— 

—and fell right through the wall. 

No way to catch my balance. Nothing to grab on to. 

I was falling, falling down through total darkness. 



9 


My hands flailed wildly as I fell. 

I reached out frantically for something to grab on to. 

It all happened too fast to cry out. 

I landed hard on my back. Pain shot out through my arms and legs. 
The darkness swirled around me. 

My breath was knocked right out of me. I saw bright flashes of red, 
then everything went black again. I struggled to breathe, but couldn’t suck 
in any air. 

I had that horrible heavy feeling in my chest, like when a basketball 
hits you in the stomach. 

Finally, I sat up, struggling to see in the total darkness. I heard a soft, 
shuffling sound. Something scraping over the hard dirt floor. 

“Hey—can anyone hear me?” My voice came out a hoarse whisper. 
Now my back ached, but I was starting to breathe normally. 

“Hey—I’m down here!” I called, a little louder. 

No reply. 

Didn’t they miss me? Weren’t they looking for me? 

I was leaning back on my hands, starting to feel better. My right hand 
started to itch. 

I reached to scratch it and brushed something away. 

And realized my legs were itching, too. And felt something crawling 
on my left wrist. 

I shook my hand hard. “What’s going on here?” I whispered to myself. 
My entire body tingled. I felt soft pinpricks up my arms and legs. 
Shaking both arms, I jumped to my feet. And banged my helmet 
against a low ledge. 

The light flickered on. 

I gasped when I saw the crawling creatures in the narrow beam of 

light. 

Spiders. Hundreds of bulby, white spiders, thick on the chamber floor. 
They scuttled across the floor, climbing over each other. As I jerked 



my head up and the light swept up with it, I saw that the stone walls were 
covered with them, too. The white spiders made the wall appear to move, as 
if it were alive. 

Spiders hung on invisible threads from the chamber ceiling. They 
seemed to bob and float in midair. 

I shook one off the back of my hand. 

And with a gasp, realized why my legs itched. Spiders were crawling 
all over them. Up over my arms. Down my back. 

“Help—somebody! Please!” I managed to cry out. 

I felt a spider drop on to the top of my head. 

I brushed it away with a frantic slap. “Somebody—help me!” I 
screamed. “Can anyone hear me?” 

And then I saw something scarier. Much scarier. A snake slid down 
from above me, lowering itself rapidly toward my face. 



10 


I ducked and tried to cover my head as the snake silently dropped toward 
me. 

“Grab it!” I heard someone call. “Grab on to it!” 

With a startled cry, I raised my eyes. The light beam followed. And I 
saw that it was not a snake that stretched from above—but a rope. 

“Grab on to it, Gabe! Hurry!” Sari shouted urgently from high above. 

Brushing away spiders, kicking frantically to shake the spiders off my 
sneakers, I grasped the rope with both hands. 

And felt myself being tugged up, pulled up through the darkness to the 
tunnel floor above. 

A few seconds later, Uncle Ben reached down and grabbed me under 
the shoulders. As he hoisted me up, I could see Sari and Nila pulling with 
all their might on the rope. 

I cheered happily as my feet touched solid ground. But I didn’t have 
long to celebrate. My entire body felt as if it were on fire! 

I went wild, kicking my legs, brushing spiders off my arms, scratching 
spiders off my back, stamping on the spiders as they scuttled off me. 

Glancing up, I saw that Sari was laughing at me. “Gabe, what do you 
call that dance?” she asked. 

Uncle Ben and Nila laughed, too. “How did you fall down there, 
Gabe?” my uncle demanded, peering down into the spider chamber. 

“The wall—it gave way,” I told him, frantically scratching my legs. 

“I thought you were still with me,” Sari explained. “When I turned 
around...” Her voice trailed off. 

The light on Uncle Ben’s helmet beamed down to the lower chamber. 
“That’s a long fall,” Uncle Ben said, turning back to me. “Are you sure 
you’re okay?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. I guess. It knocked the wind out of me. And then the 
spiders—” 

“There must be hundreds of chambers like that,” my uncle 
commented, glancing at Nila. “The pyramid builders made a maze of 
tunnels and chambers—to fool tomb robbers and keep them from finding 



the real tomb.” 

“Yuck! Such fat spiders!” Sari groaned, stepping back. 

“There are millions of them down there,” I told her. “On the walls, 
hanging from the ceiling—everywhere.” 

“This is going to give me bad dreams,” Nila said softly, moving closer 
to Uncle Ben. 

“You sure you’re okay?” my uncle demanded again. 

I started to reply. Then I suddenly remembered something. The 
mummy hand. It was tucked in my back pocket. 

Had it been crushed when I landed on it? 

My heart skipped a beat. I didn’t want anything bad to happen to that 
little hand. It was my good luck charm. 

I reached into my jeans pocket and pulled it out. Holding it under the 
light from my hard hat, I examined it carefully. 

I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that it was okay. It still felt cold. 
But it hadn’t been crushed. 

“What’s that?” Nila asked, leaning closer to see it better. She brushed 
her long hair away from her face. “Is that The Summoner?” 

“How did you know that?” I demanded, holding the hand up so she 
could see it better. 

Nila stared at it intently. “I know a lot about ancient Egypt,” she 
replied. “I’ve studied it my whole life.” 

“It might be an ancient relic,” Uncle Ben broke in. 

“Or it might just be a tacky souvenir,” Sari added. 

“It has real powers,” I insisted, brushing it off carefully. “I landed on it 
down there—” I pointed to the spider chamber—“and it didn’t get crushed.” 

“I guess it is a good luck charm,” Nila said, turning back to Uncle Ben. 

“Then why didn’t it keep Gabe from falling through that wall?” Sari 
cracked. 

Before I could answer, I saw the mummy hand move. The tiny fingers 
slowly curled. Out and then in. 

I cried out and nearly dropped it. 

“Gabe—now what?” Uncle Ben demanded sharply. 

“Uh... nothing,” I replied. 

They wouldn’t believe me anyway. 

“I think we’ve done enough exploring for now,” Uncle Ben said. 



As we made our way to the entrance, I held the mummy hand in front 
of me. 

I wasn’t seeing things. I knew that for sure. The fingers really had 
moved. 

But why? 

Was the hand trying to signal me? Was it trying to warn me about 
something? 



11 


Two days later, Uncle Ben’s workers reached the doorway to the burial 
chamber. 

Sari and I had spent the two days hanging around in the tent or 
exploring the area outside the pyramid. Since it was mostly sand, there 
wasn’t much to explore. 

We spent one long afternoon playing game after game of Scrabble. 
Playing Scrabble with Sari wasn’t much fun at all. She was a very defensive 
player and spent hours figuring out ways to clog the board and block me 
from getting any good words. 

Whenever I put down a really good word, Sari claimed it wasn’t a real 
word and couldn’t be allowed. And since we didn’t have a dictionary in the 
tent, she won most of the arguments. 

Uncle Ben, meanwhile, seemed really stressed out. I thought maybe he 
was nervous about finally opening the tomb. 

He barely spoke to Sari and me. Instead, he spent a lot of time meeting 
with people I didn’t recognize. He seemed very serious and businesslike. 
None of his usual backslapping and joking. 

Uncle Ben also spent a lot of time talking with Nila. At first, she’d said 
she wanted to write about his discovery in the pyramid. But now she’d 
decided to write an article about him. She wrote down nearly every word he 
said in a little pad she carried with her. 

Then, at breakfast, he finally smiled for the first time in two days. 
“Today’s the day,” he announced. 

Sari and I couldn’t hide our excitement. “Are you taking us with you?” 
I asked. 

Uncle Ben nodded. “I want you to be there,” he replied. “Perhaps we 
will make history today. Perhaps it will be a day you will want to remember 
for the rest of your lives.” He shrugged and added thoughtfully: “Perhaps.” 

A few minutes later, the three of us followed several workers across 
the sand toward the pyramid. It was a gray day. Heavy clouds hovered low 
in the sky, threatening rain. The pyramid rose up darkly to meet the clouds. 

As we approached the small opening in the back wall, Nila came 



running up, her camera bobbing in front of her. She wore a long-sleeved, 
blue denim work shirt over loose-fitting, faded jeans. 

Uncle Ben greeted her warmly. “But still no photographs,” he told her 
firmly. “Promise?” 

Nila smiled back at him. Her green eyes lit up excitedly. She raised a 
hand to her heart. “Promise.” 

We all took yellow hard hats from the equipment dump. Uncle Ben 
was carrying a large stone mallet. He lowered himself into the entrance, and 
we followed. 

My heart was racing as I hurried to keep up with Sari. The lights from 
our helmets darted over the narrow tunnel. Far up ahead, I could hear the 
voices of workers and the steady scrape of their digging tools. 

“This is really awesome!” I exclaimed breathlessly to Sari. 

“Maybe the tomb is filled with jewels,” Sari whispered as we made 
our way around a curve. “Sapphires and rubies and emeralds. Maybe I’ll get 
to try on a jeweled crown worn by an Egyptian princess.” 

“Do you think there’s a mummy in the tomb?” I asked. I wasn’t too 
interested in jewels. “Do you think the mummified body of Prince Khor-Ru 
is lying there, waiting to be discovered?” 

Sari made a disgusted face. “Is that all you can think about— 
mummies?” 

“Well, we are in an ancient Egyptian pyramid!” I shot back. 

“There could be millions of dollars’ worth of jewels and relics in that 
tomb,” Sari scolded. “And all you can think about is some moldy old body 
wrapped up in tar and gauze.” She shook her head. “You know, most kids 
get over their fascination with mummies by the time they’re eight or nine.” 

“Uncle Ben didn’t!” I replied. 

That shut her up. 

We followed Nila and Uncle Ben in silence. After a while, the narrow 
tunnel curved up sharply. The air grew warmer as we followed it up. 

I could see lights ahead. Two battery-powered spotlights were trained 
on the far wall. As we drew closer, I realized it wasn’t a wall. It was a door. 

Four workers—two men and two women—were on their knees, 
working with small shovels and picks. They were scraping the last chunks 
of dirt away from the door. 

“It looks beautiful!” Uncle Ben cried, running up to the workers. They 



turned to greet him. “It’s awesome in the true sense of the word!” he 
declared. 

Nila, Sari, and I stepped up behind him. Uncle Ben was right. The 
ancient door really was awesome! 

It wasn’t very tall. I could see that Uncle Ben would have to stoop to 
step into it. But it looked like a door fit for a prince. 

The dark mahogany wood—now petrified—must have been brought 
from far away. I knew that kind of wood didn’t come from any trees that 
grew in Egypt. 

Strange hieroglyphics covered the door from top to bottom. I 
recognized birds, and cats, and other animals etched deeply into the dark 
wood. 

The most startling sight of all was the seal that locked the door—a 
snarling lion’s head, sculpted in gold. The light from the spotlights made 
the lion glow like the sun. 

“The gold is soft,” I heard one of the workers tell my uncle. “The seal 
will break away easily.” 

Uncle Ben lowered his heavy mallet to the ground. He stared for a 
long moment at the glowing lion’s head, then turned back to us. “They 
thought this lion would scare any intruders away from the tomb,” he 
explained. “I guess it worked. Till now.” 

“Dr. Hassad, I have to photograph the actual breaking of the seal,” 
Nila said, stepping up beside him. “You really must let me. We can’t let the 
moment go unrecorded.” 

He gazed at her thoughtfully. “Well... okay,” he agreed. 

A pleased smile crossed her face as she raised her camera. “Thanks, 
Ben.” 

The workers stepped back. One of them handed Uncle Ben a hammer 
and a delicate tool that looked like a doctor’s scalpel. “It’s all yours, Dr. 
Hassad,” she said. 

Uncle Ben raised the tools and stepped up to the seal. “Once I break 
this seal, we will open the door and step into a room that hasn’t been seen in 
four thousand years,” he announced. 

Nila steadied her camera over her eye, carefully adjusting the lens. 

Sari and I moved up beside the workers. 

The gold lion appeared to glow brighter as Uncle Ben raised the tool. 



A hush fell over the tunnel. I could feel the excitement, feel the tension in 
the air. 

Such suspense! 

I realized I had been holding my breath. I let it out in a long, silent 
whoosh and took another. 

I glanced at Sari. She was nervously chewing her lower lip. Her hands 
were pressed tightly at her sides. 

“Anyone hungry? Maybe we should forget about this and send out for 
a pizza!” Uncle Ben joked. 

We all laughed loudly. 

That was Uncle Ben for you—cracking a dumb joke at what might be 
the most exciting moment of his life. 

The tense silence returned. Uncle Ben’s expression turned serious. He 
turned back to the ancient seal. He raised the small chisel to the back of the 
seal. Then he started to lift the hammer. 

And a booming voice rang out, “PLEASE—LET ME REST IN 
PEACE!” 



12 


I let out a startled cry. 

“LET ME REST IN PEACE!” the booming voice repeated. 

I saw Uncle Ben lower his chisel. He spun around, his eyes wide with 
surprise. 

I realized the voice came from behind us. I turned to see a man I had 
never seen before, half hidden in the shadowy tunnel. He made his way 
toward us, taking long, steady strides. 

He was a tall, lanky man, so tall he really had to hunch his shoulders in 
the low tunnel. Bald except for a fringe of dark hair at the ears, he had a 
slender face, an unfriendly scowl on his thin lips. 

He wore a perfectly ironed safari jacket over a shirt and necktie. His 
black eyes, like little raisins, glared at my uncle. I wondered if the man ever 
ate. He was as skinny as a mummy himself! 

“Omar—!” Uncle Ben started. “I wasn’t expecting you back from 
Cairo.” 

“Let me rest in peace,” Dr. Fielding repeated, softer this time. “Those 
are the words of Prince Khor-Ru. Written on the ancient stone we found last 
month. That was the prince’s wish.” 

“Omar, we’ve been over this before,” my uncle replied, sighing. He 
lowered the hammer and chisel to his sides. 

Dr. Fielding pushed past Sari and me as if we weren’t there. He 
stopped in front of my uncle and swept a hand back over his bald head. 
“Well, then, how can you dare to break the seal?” Dr. Fielding demanded. 

“I am a scientist,” my uncle replied slowly, speaking each word clearly 
and distinctly. “I cannot allow superstition to stand in the way of discovery, 
Omar.” 

“I am also a scientist,” Dr. Fielding replied, using both hands to tighten 
his necktie. “But I am not willing to defile this ancient tomb. I am not 
willing to go against the wishes of Prince Khor-Ru. And I am not willing to 
call the words of the hieroglyph mere superstition.” 

“This is where we disagree,” Uncle Ben said softly. He motioned to 
the four workers. “We have spent too many months, too many years, to stop 



just outside the door. We have come this far, Omar. We must go the rest of 
the way.” 

Dr. Fielding chewed his lower lip. He pointed to the top of the door. 
“Look, Ben. There are the same hieroglyphs as on the stone. The same 
warning. Let me rest in peace. ” 

“I know, I know,” my uncle said, frowning. 

“The warning is very clear,” Dr. Fielding continued heatedly, his tiny 
raisin eyes narrowed at my uncle. “If anyone should disturb the prince, if 
anyone should repeat the ancient words written on the tomb five times—the 
mummified prince shall come to life. And he shall seek his vengeance on 
those who disturbed him.” 

Listening to those words made me shudder. I stared hard at Uncle Ben. 
Why hadn’t he ever told Sari and me about the prince’s threat? Why hadn’t 
he ever mentioned the words of warning they had found on an ancient 
stone? 

Was he afraid he might frighten us? 

Was he frightened himself? 

No. No way. 

He didn’t seem at all frightened now as he argued with Dr. Fielding. I 
could tell they had had this argument before. And I could see there was no 
way that Dr. Fielding was going to stop my uncle from breaking the seal 
and entering the tomb. 

“This is my final warning, Ben—” Dr. Fielding said. “For the sake of 
everyone here...” He motioned with one hand to the four workers. 

“Superstition,” Uncle Ben replied. “I cannot be stopped by 
superstition. I am a scientist.” He raised the chisel and hammer. “The seal 
will be broken.” 

Dr. Fielding tossed up both hands in disgust. “I will not be a party to 
this,” he declared. He spun around, nearly hitting his head on the tunnel 
ceiling. Then, muttering to himself, he hurried away, disappearing quickly 
into the darkness of the tunnel. 

Uncle Ben took a couple of steps after him. “Omar—? Omar?” 

But we could hear Dr. Fielding’s footsteps growing fainter as he made 
his way out of the pyramid. 

Uncle Ben sighed and leaned close to me. “I don’t trust that man,” he 
muttered. “He doesn’t really care about the old superstitions. He wants to 



steal this discovery for himself. That’s why he tried to make me stop 
outside the door.” 

I didn’t know how to reply. My uncle’s words startled me. I thought 
scientists had rules about who took credit for what discoveries. 

Uncle Ben whispered something to Nila. Then he made his way back 
to the four workers. “If any of you agree with Dr. Fielding,” he told them, 
“you are free to leave now.” 

The workers exchanged glances with one another. 

“You have all heard the words of warning on the tomb door. I do not 
want to force anyone to enter the tomb,” Uncle Ben told them. 

“But we have worked so hard,” one of the men said. “We cannot stop 
here. We have no choice. We have to open that door.” 

A smile crossed my uncle’s face. “I agree,” he said, turning back to the 
lion seal. 

I glanced at Sari and realized that she was already staring at me. 
“Gabe, if you’re scared, Daddy will let you leave,” she whispered. “You 
don’t have to be embarrassed.” 

She never quits! 

“I’m staying,” I whispered back. “But if you want me to walk you 
back to the tent, I will.” 

A loud clink made us both turn back to the door. Uncle Ben was 
working to pry off the gold lion seal. Nila had her camera poised. The 
workers stood tensely, watching Uncle Ben’s every move. 

Uncle Ben worked slowly, carefully. He slid the chisel behind the 
ancient seal and gently pried and scraped. 

A few minutes later, the seal fell into my uncle’s hands. Nila busily 
snapped photograph after photograph. Uncle Ben carefully passed it to one 
of the workers. “That’s not a Christmas gift,” he joked. “I’m keeping that 
for my mantelpiece! ” 

Everyone laughed. 

Uncle Ben gripped the edge of the door with both hands. “I’m going in 
first,” he announced. “If I’m not back in twenty minutes, go tell Dr. 
Fielding he was right!” 

More laughter. 

Two of the workers moved to help Uncle Ben slide open the door. 
They pressed their shoulders against it, straining hard. 



The door didn’t budge. 

“It might need a little oiling,” Uncle Ben joked. “After all, it’s been 
closed for four thousand years.” 

They worked for several minutes with picks and chisels, carefully 
freeing the door. Then they tried once again, pressing their shoulders 
against the heavy mahogany door. 

“Yes!” Uncle Ben cried out as the door slid an inch. 

Then another inch. Another inch. 

Everyone pressed forward, eager to get a view of the ancient tomb. 

Two of the workers moved the large spotlights, aiming them into the 
doorway. 

As Uncle Ben and his two helpers pushed against the door, Sari and I 
stepped up beside Nila. “Isn’t this amazing!” Nila cried excitedly. “I can’t 
believe I’m the only reporter here! I’m so lucky!” 

I’m lucky, too, I realized. How many kids would give anything to be 
standing right where I am? How many kids would love to be one of the first 
people in the world to step into a four-thousand-year-old tomb in an 
Egyptian pyramid? 

The faces of some of my friends back home suddenly popped into my 
mind. I realized I couldn’t wait to tell them about my adventure here! 

The door scraped noisily against the dirt floor. Another inch. Another 

inch. 

The opening was almost big enough for a person to squeeze through. 

“Move the light a little,” Uncle Ben instructed. “Another few inches, 
and we can go in and shake hands with the prince.” 

The door scraped open another inch. With a great heave, Uncle Ben 
and his helpers forced it open another few inches. 

“Yes!” he cried happily. 

Nila snapped a photograph. 

We all pressed forward eagerly. 

Uncle Ben slid through the opening first. 

Sari bumped me out of the way and cut in front of me. 

My heart was pounding hard. My hands were suddenly ice cold. 

I didn’t care who went in first. I just wanted to go in! 

One by one, we slipped into the ancient chamber. 

Finally, my turn came. I took a deep breath, slipped through the 



opening, and saw— 

—nothing. 

Except for a lot of cobwebs, the chamber was bare. 
Totally bare. 



13 


I let out a long sigh. Poor Unde Ben. All that work for nothing. I felt so 
disappointed. 

I glanced around the bare chamber. The spotlights made the thick 
cobwebs glow like silver. Our shadows stretched across the dirt floor like 
ghosts. 

I turned to Uncle Ben, expecting him to be disappointed, too. But to 
my surprise, he had a smile on his face. “Move the lights,” he told one of 
the workers. “And bring the tools. We have another seal to remove.” 

He pointed across the empty room to the back wall. In the gray light, I 
could make out the outline of a door. Another sculpted lion sealed it shut. 

“I knew this wasn’t the real burial chamber!” Sari cried, grinning at 
me. 

“As I said, the Egyptians often did this,” Uncle Ben explained. “They 
built several false chambers to hide the real chamber from grave robbers.” 
He pulled off his hard hat and scratched his hair. “In fact,” he continued, 
“we may find several empty chambers before we find Prince Khor-Ru’s 
resting place.” 

Nila snapped a photo of Uncle Ben examining the newly discovered 
door. She smiled at me. “You should have seen the expression on your face, 
Gabe,” she said. “You looked so disappointed.” 

“I thought—” I started. But the scrape of Uncle Ben’s chisel against 
the seal made me stop. 

We all turned to watch him work at the seal. Staring across the 
cobweb-filled chamber, I tried to imagine what waited for us on the other 
side of the door. 

Another empty chamber? Or a four-thousand-year-old Egyptian prince, 
surrounded by all of his treasures and belongings? 

Work on the door went slowly. We all broke for lunch and then 
returned. That afternoon Uncle Ben and his helpers worked for another 
couple of hours, carefully trying to remove the seal without damaging it. 

As they worked, Sari and I sat on the floor and watched. The air was 
hot and kind of sour. I guess it was ancient air. Sari and I talked about last 



summer and the adventures we’d had in the Great Pyramid. Nila snapped 
our picture. 

“Almost got it,” Uncle Ben announced. 

We all started to get excited again. Sari and I climbed to our feet and 
crossed the room to get a better view. 

The lion seal slid free from the door. Two of the workers placed it 
gently into a padded crate. Then Uncle Ben and the other two workers set to 
work pushing open the door. 

This door proved even more difficult than the last. “It’s... really... 
stuck,” Uncle Ben groaned. He and the workers pulled out more tools and 
began prying and chipping away the hard crust that had formed on the 
doorway over the centuries. 

An hour later, they got the door to slide an inch. Then another inch. 
Another. 

When it had slid halfway open, Uncle Ben removed the light from his 
helmet and beamed it through the opening. He peered into the next chamber 
for the longest time without saying a word. 

Sari and I moved closer. My heart began racing again. 

What did he see? I wondered. What was he staring at so silently? 

Finally, Uncle Ben lowered the light and turned back to us. “We’ve 
made a big mistake,” he said quietly. 



14 


A shocked silence fell over the room. I swallowed hard, stunned by my 
uncle’s words. 

But then a broad smile crossed his face. “We made a mistake by 
underestimating our discovery!” he exclaimed. “This will be more 
important than the discovery of King Tut! This tomb is even grander!” 

A gleeful cheer echoed against the stone walls. The workers rushed 
forward to shake Uncle Ben’s hand and offer their congratulations. 

“Congratulations to us all!” Uncle Ben declared happily. 

We were all laughing and talking excitedly as we slipped through the 
narrow opening, into the next chamber. 

As the lights beamed over the vast room, I knew I was seeing 
something I would never forget. Even the thick layer of dust and cobwebs 
could not cover the amazing treasures that filled the chamber. 

My eyes darted quickly around. I struggled to focus on it all. But there 
was too much to see! I actually felt dizzy. 

The walls were covered from floor to ceiling with hieroglyphics, 
etched into the stone. The floor was cluttered with furniture and other 
objects. It looked more like someone’s attic or a storeroom than a tomb! 

A tall, straight-backed throne caught my eye. It had a golden, radiating 
sun etched into the seat-back. Behind it, I saw chairs and benches, and a 
long couch. 

Against the wall were stacked dozens of stone and clay jars. Some 
were cracked and broken. But many were in perfect condition. 

A gold monkey head lay on its side in the middle of the floor. Behind 
it, I saw several large chests. 

Uncle Ben and one of the workers carefully pulled back the lid of one 
of the chests. Their eyes grew wide as they gaped inside. 

“Jewelry!” Uncle Ben declared. “It’s filled with gold jewelry!” 

Sari came up beside me, an excited grin on her face. 

“This is awesomel” I whispered. 

She nodded agreement. “Awesome!” 

We whispered in the heavy silence. No one else talked. Everyone was 



too overwhelmed by the amazing sight. The loudest sound was the clicking 
of Nila’s camera. 

Uncle Ben stepped between Sari and me and placed a hand on our 
shoulders. “Isn’t this unbelievable?” he cried. “It’s all in perfect condition. 
Untouched for four thousand years.” 

When I glanced up at him, I saw that he had tears in his eyes. This is 
the greatest moment of Uncle Ben’s life, I realized. 

“We must be very careful—” Uncle Ben started. But he stopped in 
midsentence, and I saw his expression change. 

As he guided Sari and me across the room, I saw what he was staring 
at. A large stone mummy case, hidden in shadow, stood against the far wall. 

“Oh, wow!” I murmured as we stepped up to it. 

Made of smooth, gray stone, the heavy lid had a long crack down the 
center. 

“Is the prince buried inside it?” Sari asked eagerly. 

It took Uncle Ben a moment to reply. He stood between us, his eyes 
locked on the ancient mummy case. “We’ll soon see,” he finally replied. 

As he and the four workers struggled to move the lid, Nila lowered her 
camera and stepped forward to watch. Her green eyes stared intensely as 
the lid slowly slid away. 

Inside was a coffin in the shape of the mummy. It wasn’t very long. 
And it was narrower than I thought it would be. 

The workers slowly pried open the coffin’s lid. I gasped and grabbed 
Uncle Ben’s hand as the mummy was revealed. 

It looked so tiny and frail! 

“Prince Khor-Ru,” Uncle Ben muttered, staring down into the stone 

case. 

The prince lay on his back, his slender arms crossed over his chest. 
Black tar had seeped through the bandages. The gauze had worn away from 
the head, revealing the tar-covered skull. 

As I leaned over the case, my heart in my throat, the tar-blackened 
eyes seemed to stare helplessly up at me. 

There’s a real person inside there, I thought, feeling a chill run down 
my spine. He’s about my size. And he died. And they covered him with hot 
tar and cloth. And he’s been lying in this case for four thousand years. 

A real person. A royal prince. 



I stared at the stained, cracked tar that covered his face. At the 
gauzelike cloth, all frayed and yellowed. At the stiff body, so frail and 
small. 

He was alive once, I thought. Did he ever dream that four thousand 
years later, people would open his coffin and stare at him? Stare at his 
mummified body? 

I took a step back to catch my breath. It was too exciting. 

I saw that Nila also had tears in her eyes. She rested both hands on the 
edge of the case and leaned over the prince’s body, her eyes locked on the 
blackened face. 

“These may be the best-preserved remains ever found,” Uncle Ben 
said quietly. “Of course we will have to do many tests to determine the 
young man’s identity. But, judging from everything else in this chamber, I 
think it’s safe to say...” 

His voice trailed off as we all heard sounds from the outer chamber. 
Footsteps. Voices. 

I spun around toward the doorway as four black-uniformed police 
officers burst into the room. “Okay. Everybody take one step back,” one of 
them ordered, lowering his hand to the gun holster at his side. 



15 


Startled cries filled the room. Uncle Ben spun around, his eyes wide with 
surprise. “What is happening?” he cried. 

The four Cairo police officers, their features set in hard frowns, moved 
quickly into the center of the room. 

“Be careful!” Uncle Ben warned, standing in front of the mummy case 
as if protecting it. “Do not move anything. It is all terribly fragile.” 

He pulled off the hard hat. His eyes went from officer to officer. “What 
are you doing here?” 

“I asked them to come,” a voice boomed from the doorway. 

Dr. Fielding entered, a pleased expression on his face. His tiny eyes 
danced excitedly. 

“Omar—I don’t understand,” Uncle Ben said, taking a few steps 
toward the other scientist. 

“I thought it best to protect the contents of the room,” Dr. Fielding 
replied. He gazed quickly around the room, taking in the treasures. 

“Wonderful! This is wonderful!” he cried. He stepped forward and 
shook my uncle’s hand enthusiastically. “Congratulations, everyone!” he 
boomed. “This is almost too much to believe.” 

Uncle Ben’s expression softened. “I still do not understand the need 
for them,” he said, motioning to the grim-faced officers. “No one in this 
room is about to steal anything.” 

“Certainly not,” Dr. Fielding replied, still squeezing Uncle Ben’s hand. 
“Certainly not. But word will soon get out, Ben. And I thought we should 
be prepared to guard what we have found.” 

Uncle Ben eyed the four officers suspiciously. But then he shrugged 
his broad shoulders. “Perhaps you are right,” he told Dr. Fielding. “Perhaps 
you are being smart.” 

“Just ignore them,” Dr. Fielding replied. He slapped my uncle on the 
back. “I owe you an apology, Ben. I was wrong to try to stop you before. As 
a scientist, I should have known better. We owed it to the world to open this 
tomb. I hope you’ll forgive me. We have much to celebrate—don’t we!” 



* * * 


“I don’t trust him,” Uncle Ben confided that evening as we walked from the 
tent to dinner. “I don’t trust my partner at all.” 

It was a clear night, surprisingly cool. The purple sky was dotted with 
a million twinkling white stars. A steady breeze made the palm trees sway 
on the horizon. The big campfire up ahead dipped and shifted with the 
wind. 

“Is Dr. Fielding coming with us to dinner?” Sari asked. She wore a 
pale green sweater, pulled down over black leggings. 

Uncle Ben shook his head. “No, he hurried to phone Cairo. I think he’s 
eager to tell our backers the good news.” 

“He seemed really excited when he saw the mummy and everything,” I 
said, glancing at the pyramid rising darkly to the evening sky. 

“Yes, he did,” my uncle admitted. “He certainly changed his mind in a 
hurry! But I’m keeping my eye on him. Omar would like nothing better 
than to take over the project. I’m going to keep an eye on those police 
officers of his, too.” 

“Daddy, this should be a happy night,” Sari scolded. “Let’s not talk 
about Dr. Fielding. Let’s just talk about Prince Khor-Ru and how you’re 
going to be rich and famous!” 

Uncle Ben laughed. “It’s a deal,” he told her. 

Nila waited for us by the campfire. Uncle Ben had invited her to join 
us for a barbecue. She wore a white sweatshirt over loose-fitting jeans. Her 
amber pendant caught the light from the half-moon, just rising over the 
tents. 

She looked really pretty. She flashed Uncle Ben a warm smile as we 
came near. I could tell by his face that he liked her. 

“Sari, you’re taller than Gabe, aren’t you!” Nila commented. 

Sari grinned. She loved being taller than me, even though I’m a little 
older. 

“Less than an inch,” I said quickly. 

“People are definitely getting taller,” Nila said, to my uncle. “Prince 
Khor-Ru was so short. He’d be a midget today!” 

“It makes you wonder why such short people built such tall pyramids,” 
Uncle Ben said, grinning. 



Nila smiled and took his arm. 

Sari and I exchanged glances. I could see what Sari was thinking. Her 
expression said: What’s up with those two? 

We had a great dinner. Uncle Ben burned the hamburger rolls a little. 
But no one really minded. 

Sari downed two hamburgers. I could only eat one. That gave her 
something else to boast about. 

I was really getting fed up with my bragging cousin. I found myself 
trying to think of a way to get back at her. 

Nila and Uncle Ben kidded around a lot. 

“That burial chamber looked like a movie set,” Nila teased my uncle. 
“It was all too perfect. All that gold. And that perfect little mummy. It’s all 
a fake. That’s what I’m going to write in my article.” 

Uncle Ben laughed. He turned to me. “Did you check out the mummy, 
Gabe? Was this one wearing a wristwatch?” 

I shook my head. “No wristwatch.” 

“See?” Uncle Ben told Nila. “No wristwatch. So it’s got to be real!” 

“I guess that proves it,” Nila said, smiling warmly at my uncle. 

“Daddy, do you know the words to bring the mummy to life?” Sari 
broke in. “You know. The words on the tomb that Dr. Fielding was talking 
about?” 

Uncle Ben swallowed the last bite of his hamburger. He wiped the 
grease off his chin with a napkin. “I can’t believe that a serious scientist 
would believe such superstition,” he murmured. 

“But what are the six words to bring the mummy to life?” Nila 
demanded. “Come on, Ben. Tell us.” 

Uncle Ben’s smile faded. He shook his finger at Nila. “Oh, no!” he 
declared. “I don’t trust you. If I tell you the words, you’ll bring the mummy 
back to fife just to get a good photograph for your newspaper!” 

We all laughed. 

We were sitting around the campfire, its orange light flickering over 
our faces. Uncle Ben set his plate down on the ground and spread his hands 
over the fire. 

“Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki Khari!” he chanted in a deep voice, 
waving his hands over the flames. 

The fire crackled. A twig made a loud popping sound that made my 



heart skip a beat. 

“Are those the secret words?” Sari demanded. 

Uncle Ben nodded solemnly. “Those are the words of the hieroglyphs 
over the entrance to the tomb.” 

“So maybe the mummy just sat up and stretched?” Sari asked. 

“I’d be very surprised,” Uncle Ben replied, climbing to his feet. 
“You’re forgetting, Sari—you have to chant the words five times.” 

“Oh.” Sari stared thoughtfully into the fire. 

I repeated the words in my mind. “Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki 
Khari! ” I needed to memorize the words. I had a plan to scare Sari. 

“Where are you going?” Nila asked my uncle. 

“To the communications tent,” he replied. “I have to make a phone 
call.” He turned and made his way quickly over the sand toward the row of 
canvas tents. 

Nila let out a surprised laugh. “He didn’t even say goodnight.” 

“Daddy’s always like that,” Sari explained, “when he has something 
on his mind.” 

“Guess I’d better go, too,” Nila said, climbing to her feet and brushing 
sand off her jeans. “I’m going to start writing my story for the paper.” 

She said good night and walked quickly away, her sandals making a 
slapping sound against the sand. 

Sari and I sat staring into the crackling fire. The half-moon had floated 
high in the sky. Its pale light reflected off the top of the pyramid in the 
distance. 

“Nila is right,” I told Sari. “It really did look like a movie set in there.” 

Sari didn’t reply. She stared into the fire without blinking, thinking 
hard. Something in the fire popped again. The sound seemed to snap her out 
of her thoughts. 

“Do you think Nila likes Daddy?” she asked me, her dark eyes locking 
on mine. 

“Yeah, I guess,” I replied. “She’s always giving him this smile.” I 
imitated Nila’s smile. “And she’s always kind of teasing him.” 

Sari thought about my reply. “And do you think Daddy likes her?” 

I grinned. “For sure.” I stood up. I was eager to get back to the tent. I 
wanted to scare Sari. 

We walked toward the tents in silence. I guessed that Sari was still 



thinking about her dad and Nila. 

The night air was cool, but it was warm inside the tent. Moonlight 
filtered through the canvas. Sari pulled her trunk out from under her cot and 
got down on her knees to search through her clothes. 

“Sari,” I whispered. “Dare me to recite the ancient words five times?” 

“Huh?” She gazed up from the trunk. 

“I’m going to chant the words five times,” I told her. “You know. See 
if anything happens.” 

I expected her to beg me not to. I expected her to get scared and plead: 
“Please, Gabe—don’t do it! Don’t! It’s too dangerous!” 

But, instead, Sari turned back to her clothes trunk. “Hey. Give it a try,” 
she told me. 

“You sure?” I asked her. 

“Yeah. Why not?” she replied, pulling out a pair of denim cutoffs. 

I stared across the tent at her. Was that fear I saw in her eyes? Was she 
just pretending to be so casual about it? 

Yes. I think Sari was a little scared. And trying hard not to show it. 

I took a few steps closer and chanted the ancient words, in the same 
low voice Uncle Ben had used: “Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki Khari!” 

Sari dropped the jeans and turned to watch me. 

I repeated the chant a second time: “Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki 
Khari!” 

A third time. 

A fourth time. 

I hesitated. I felt a cold breeze tingle the back of my neck. 

Should I chant the words again? Should I go for number five? 



16 


I stared down at Sari. 

She had closed the trunk lid and was leaning on it tensely, staring back 
at me. I could see that she was frightened. She chewed her bottom lip. 

Should I chant the words for a fifth time? 

I felt another chill at the back of my neck. 

It’s just superstition, I told myself. Four-thousand-year-old 
superstition. 

There’s no way that moldy, old mummified prince is going to come 
back to life just because I recite six words I don’t even know the meaning 
of! 

No way. 

I suddenly thought of all the old movies I had rented about mummies 
in ancient Egypt. In the movies, the scientists always ignored ancient curses 
warning them not to disturb the mummies’ tombs. Then the mummies 
always came to life to get their revenge. They staggered around, grabbed 
the scientists by the throat, and strangled them. 

Dumb movies. But I loved them. 

Now, staring down at Sari, I saw that she was really scared. 

I took a deep breath. I suddenly realized that I felt scared, too. 

But it was too late. I had gone too far. I couldn’t chicken out now. 

“Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki Khari!” I shouted. The fifth time. 

I froze—and waited. I don’t know what I expected. A flash of 
lightning, maybe. 

Sari climbed to her feet. She tugged at a strand of dark hair. 

“Admit it. You’re totally freaked,” I said, unable to keep a grin from 
spreading across my face. 

“No way!” she insisted. “Go ahead, Gabe. Chant the words again. 
Chant them a hundred times! You’re not going to scare me! No way!” 

But we both gasped when we suddenly saw a dark shadow roll over 
the tent wall. 

And my heart completely stopped when a hoarse voice whispered into 
the tent: “Areyou in there?” 



17 


My legs trembled as I stumbled back, closer to Sari. 

I could see her eyes go wide with surprise—and fear. 

The shadow moved quickly toward the tent opening. 

We had no time to scream. No time to call for help. 

Gaping into the darkness, I saw the flap pull open—and a smooth head 
poked into the tent. 

“Ohhh.” I let out a terrified moan as the dark figure slumped toward 
us. 

The mummy is alive! The horrifying thought swept through my mind 
as I backed away. The mummy is alive! 

“Dr. Fielding!” Sari cried. 

“Huh?” I squinted to see better. 

Yes. It was Dr. Fielding. 

I struggled to say hello. But my heart was pounding so hard, I couldn’t 
speak. I took a long, deep breath and held it. 

“I’m looking for your father,” Dr. Fielding told Sari. “I must see him at 
once. It’s extremely urgent.” 

“He—he’s making a phone call,” Sari replied in a shaky voice. 

Dr. Fielding spun around and ducked out of the tent. The flap snapped 
shut behind him. 

I turned to Sari, my heart still pounding. “He scared me to death!” I 
confessed. “I thought he was in Cairo. When he poked that skinny, bald 
head into the tent...” 

Sari laughed. “He really looks like a mummy—doesn’t he?” Her smile 
faded. “I wonder why he’s in such a hurry to see Daddy.” 

“Let’s follow him!” I urged. The idea just popped into my head. 

“Yes! Let’s go!” I hadn’t expected Sari to agree so quickly. But she 
was already pushing open the tent flap. 

I followed her out of the tent. The night had grown cooler. A steady 
wind made all of the tents appear to shiver. 

“Which way did he go?” I whispered. 



Sari pointed. “I think that’s the communications tent at the end.” She 
started jogging across the sand. 

As we ran, the wind blew sand against our legs. I heard music and 
voices from one of the tents. The workers were celebrating the day’s 
discovery. 

The moon cast a strip of light like a carpet along our path. Up ahead, I 
could see Dr. Fielding’s lanky body, leaning forward, lurching awkwardly 
toward the last tent. 

He disappeared around the side of it. Sari and I stopped a few tents 
away. We ducked out of the moonlight, into deep shadows where we 
wouldn’t be seen. 

I could hear Dr. Fielding’s booming voice from the communications 
tent. He was talking rapidly, excitedly. 

“What is he saying?” Sari whispered. 

I couldn’t make out the words. 

A few seconds later, two figures emerged from the tent. Carrying 
bright flashlights, they crossed the strip of yellow moonlight, then moved 
quickly into shadow. 

Dr. Fielding appeared to be pulling Uncle Ben, pulling him toward the 
pyramid. 

“What’s going on?” Sari whispered, grabbing my sleeve. “Is he forcing 
Daddy to go with him?” 

The wind swirled the sand around us. I shivered. 

The two men were talking at the same time, shouting and gesturing 
with their flashlights. They’re arguing about something, I realized. 

Dr. Fielding had a hand on Uncle Ben’s shoulder. Was he shoving 
Uncle Ben toward the pyramid? Or was Uncle Ben actually leading the 
way? 

It was impossible to tell. 

“Let’s go,” I whispered to Sari. 

We stepped away from the tent and started to follow them. We walked 
slowly, keeping them in view, but being careful not to get too close. 

“If they turn back, they’ll see us,” Sari whispered, huddling close to 
me as we crept over the sand. 

She was right. There were no trees or bushes to hide behind here in the 
open desert. 



“Maybe they won’t turn back,” I replied hopefully. 

We crept closer. The pyramid rose up darkly in front of us. 

We saw Dr. Fielding and Uncle Ben stop at the opening in the side. I 
could hear their excited voices, but the wind carried away their words. They 
still seemed to be arguing. 

Uncle Ben disappeared into the pyramid first. Dr. Fielding went in 
right behind him. 

“Did he shove Daddy in?” Sari demanded in a shrill, frightened voice. 
“It looked like he pushed him inside!” 

“I—I don’t know,” I stammered. 

We made our way closer to the entrance. Then we both stopped and 
stared into the darkness. 

I knew we were both thinking the same thing. I knew we both had the 
same question on our lips: 

Should we follow them in? 



18 


Sari and I exchanged glances. 

The pyramid seemed so much bigger at night, so much darker. The 
gusting wind howled around its walls, as if warning us to stay back. 

We crept behind a pile of stones left by the workers. “Let’s wait out 
here for Daddy to come out,” Sari suggested. 

I didn’t argue with her. We had no flashlights, no light of any kind. I 
didn’t think we’d get very far wandering the dark tunnels by ourselves. 

I pressed up against the smooth stones and stared at the pyramid 
opening. Sari gazed up at the half-moon. Thin wisps of cloud floated over 
it. The ground darkened in front of us. 

“You don’t think Daddy is in any kind of trouble, do you?” Sari asked. 
“I mean, he told us he didn’t trust Dr. Fielding. And then—” 

“I’m sure Uncle Ben is okay,” I told her. “I mean, Dr. Fielding is a 
scientist. He’s not a criminal or anything.” 

“But why did he force Daddy into the pyramid in the middle of the 
night?” Sari asked shrilly. “And what were they arguing about?” 

I shrugged in reply. I didn’t remember ever seeing Sari so frightened. 
Normally, I would have enjoyed it. She always bragged about how brave 
and fearless she was—especially compared to me. 

But there was no way I could enjoy this. Mainly because I was just as 
scared as she was! 

It did look as if the two scientists were fighting. And it did look as if 
Dr. Fielding pushed Uncle Ben down into the pyramid. 

Sari crossed her arms over her sweater again and narrowed her eyes at 
the opening. The wind fluttered her hair, blowing strands across her 
forehead. But she made no attempt to brush them away. 

“What could be so important?” she demanded. “Why did they have to 
go into the pyramid now? Do you think something was stolen? Aren’t those 
police officers from Cairo down there guarding the place?” 

“I saw the four policemen leave,” I told her. “They piled into their 
little car and drove away, just before dinner. I don’t know why. Maybe they 
were called back to the city.” 



“I—I’m just so confused,” Sari admitted. “And worried. I didn’t like 
the look on Dr. Fielding’s face. I didn’t like the way he was so rude, just 
bursting into the tent like that. Scaring us to death. Not even saying hi.” 

“Calm down, Sari,” I said softly. “Let’s just wait. Everything will be 
okay.” 

She let out a sigh, but didn’t say anything in reply. 

We waited in silence. I don’t know how much time went by. It seemed 
like hours and hours. 

The slivers of cloud drifted away from the moon. The wind continued 
to howl eerily around the side of the pyramid. 

“Where are they? What are they doing in there?” Sari demanded. 

I started to reply—but stopped when I saw a flicker of light at the 
pyramid opening. 

I grabbed Sari’s arm. “Look—!” I whispered. 

The light grew brighter. A figure emerged, pulling himself out quickly. 

Dr. Fielding. 

As he stepped into the moonlight, I caught the strange expression on 
his face. His tiny black eyes were wide and seemed to be rolling around 
crazily in his head. His eyebrows twitched. His mouth was twisted open. He 
seemed to be breathing hard. 

Dr. Fielding brushed himself off with his hands and began walking 
away from the pyramid. He was half-walking, half-staggering, taking long, 
quick strides with his lanky legs. 

“But—where’s Daddy?” Sari whispered. 

Leaning out from the rocks, I could see the pyramid opening clearly. 
No light flickered. No sign of Uncle Ben. 

“He—he isn’t coming out!” Sari stammered. 

And before I could react, Sari leaped out from our hiding place behind 
the stones—and stepped into Dr. Fielding’s path. 

“Dr. Fielding,” she cried loudly, “where is my dad?” 

I pushed myself away from the stones and hurried after Sari. I could 
see Dr. Fielding’s eyes spinning wildly. He didn’t answer her question. 

“Where is my dad?” Sari repeated shrilly. 

Dr. Fielding acted as if he didn’t see Sari. He stepped past her, walking 
stiffly, awkwardly, his arms straight down. 

“Dr. Fielding—?” Sari called after him. 



He hurried through the darkness toward the row of tents. 

Sari turned back to me, her features tight with fear. “He’s done 
something to Daddy!” she cried. “I know he has!” 



19 


I turned back to the pyramid opening. Still dark and silent. 

The only sound now was the howling of the wind around the stone 
pyramid wall. 

“Dr. Fielding totally ignored me!” Sari cried, her face revealing her 
anger. “He stormed past me as if I weren’t here!” 

“I—I know,” I stammered weakly. 

“And did you see the look on his face?” she demanded. “So evil. So 
totally evil!” 

“Sari—” I started. “Maybe—” 

“Gabe, we have to go find Daddy!” Sari interrupted. She grabbed my 
arm and started pulling me to the pyramid opening. “Hurry!” 

“No, Sari, wait!” I insisted, tugging out of her grasp. “We can’t go 
stumbling around the pyramid in the dark. We’ll just get lost. We’ll never 
find Uncle Ben!” 

“We’ll go back to the tent and get lights,” she replied. “Quick, Gabe 

55 

I raised a hand to stop her. “Wait here, Sari,” I instructed. “Watch for 
your dad. Chances are, he’ll be climbing out in a few moments. I’ll run and 
get some flashlights.” 

Staring at the dark opening, she started to argue. But then she changed 
her mind and agreed to my plan. 

My heart pounding, I ran all the way back to the tent. I stopped at the 
tent opening, and gazed down the row of tents, searching for Dr. Fielding. 

No sign of him. 

In the tent, I grabbed up two flashlights. Then I went hurtling back to 
the pyramid. Please, I begged silently as I ran. Please be out of the 
pyramid, Uncle Ben. Please be safe. 

But as I frantically made my way over the sand, I could see Sari 
standing by herself. Even from a distance, I could see her frightened 
expression as she paced tensely back and forth in front of the pyramid 
opening. 

Uncle Ben, where are you? I wondered. Why haven’t you come out of 



the pyramid? Are you okay? 

Sari and I didn’t say a word. There was no need. 

We clicked on the flashlights, then made our way into the pyramid 
opening. It seemed much steeper than I remembered. I nearly lost my 
balance, lowering myself to the tunnel floor. 

Our lights crisscrossed over the dirt floor. I raised mine to the low 
ceiling. Keeping the light high, I led the way through the curving tunnel. 

Creeping along slowly, I trailed one hand against the wall to steady 
myself. The wall felt soft and crumbly. Sari kept on my heels, her bright 
beam of light playing over the floor in front of our feet. 

She stopped suddenly as the tunnel curved into a small, empty 
chamber. “How do we know we’re going in the right direction?” she asked, 
her voice a quivering whisper. 

I shrugged, breathing hard. “I thought you knew your way,” I 
murmured. 

“I’ve only been down here with Daddy,” she replied, her eyes over my 
shoulders, searching the empty chamber. 

“We’ll keep going until we find him,” I told her, forcing myself to 
sound braver than I felt. 

She stepped in front of me, shining the light over the chamber walls. 
“Daddy!” she shouted. “Daddy? Can you hear me?” 

Her voice echoed down the tunnel. Even the echo sounded frightened. 

We froze in place and listened for a reply. 

Silence. 

“Come on,” I urged. I had to lower my head to step into the next 
narrow tunnel. 

Where did it lead? Were we heading toward Prince Khor-Ru’s tomb? 
Is that where we would find Uncle Ben? 

Questions, questions. I tried to stop them from coming. But they filled 
my mind, pestering me, repeating, echoing in my head, as we followed the 
tunnel’s curves. 

“Daddy? Daddy—where are you?” Sari’s cries became more frantic as 
we moved deeper and deeper into the pyramid. 

The tunnel curved up steeply, then leveled off. Sari suddenly stopped. 
Startled, I bumped into her hard, nearly making her drop her flashlight. 
“Sorry,” I whispered. 



“Gabe, look—!” she cried, pointing her beam of light just ahead of her 
sneakers. “Footprints!” 

I lowered my eyes to the small circle of light. I could see a set of 
bootprints in the dirt. A heel and spikey bumps. “Work boots,” I muttered. 

She circled the floor with the light. There were several different prints 
in the dirt, heading in the same direction we were. 

“Does this mean we’re going the right way?” she asked. 

“Maybe,” I replied, studying the prints. “It’s hard to tell whether these 
are new or old.” 

“Daddy?” Sari shouted eagerly. “Can you hear me?” 

No reply. 

She frowned and motioned for me to follow. Seeing the many sets of 
prints gave us new hope, and we moved faster, trailing our hands along the 
wall to steady ourselves as we made our way. 

We both cried out happily when we realized we had reached the outer 
chamber to the tomb. Our lights played over the ancient hieroglyphs that 
covered the wall and the doorway. 

“Daddy? Daddy?” Sari’s voice cut through the heavy silence. 

We darted through the empty chamber, then slipped through the 
opening that led to the tomb. The prince’s burial chamber stretched out in 
front of us, dark and silent. 

“Daddy? Daddy?” Sari tried again. 

I shouted, too. “Uncle Ben? Are you here?” 

Silence. 

I swept my light over the room’s clutter of treasures, over the heavy 
chests, the chairs, the clay jars piled in the corner. 

“He isn’t here,” Sari choked out with a disappointed sob. 

“Then where did Dr. Fielding bring Uncle Ben?” I asked, thinking out 
loud. “There’s nowhere else in the pyramid that they might come.” 

Sari’s light came to rest on the large stone mummy case. Her eyes 
narrowed as she studied it. 

“Uncle Ben!” I shouted frantically. “Are you in here somewhere?” 

Sari grabbed my arm. “Gabe—look!” she cried. Her light remained on 
the mummy case. 

I couldn’t figure out what she was trying to show me. “What about it?” 
I demanded. 



“The lid,” Sari murmured. 

I gazed at the lid. The heavy stone slab covered the case tightly. 

“The lid is closed,” Sari continued, stepping away from me and toward 
the mummy case. Her fight remained on the lid. 

“Yeah. So?” I still didn’t understand. 

“When we all left this afternoon,” Sari explained, “the lid was open. In 
fact, I remember Daddy telling the workers to leave the lid open for 
tonight.” 

“You’re right!” I cried. 

“Help me, Gabe,” Sari pleaded, setting her flashlight down at her feet. 
“We have to open the mummy case.” 

I hesitated for a second, feeling a wave of cold fear run down my body. 
Then I took a deep breath and moved to help Sari. 

She was already pushing the stone lid with both hands. I stepped up 
beside her and pushed, too. Pushed with all my might. 

The stone slab slid more easily than I’d guessed. 

Working together, Sari and I strained against the lid, pushing... 
pushing. 

We moved it about a foot. 

Then we both lowered our heads to peer into the mummy’s case—and 
gasped in horror. 



20 


“Daddy!” Sari shrieked. 

Unde Ben lay on his back, knees raised, hands at his sides, his eyes 
shut. Sari and I shoved the heavy stone lid open another foot. 

“Is he—? Is he—?” Sari stammered. 

I pressed my hand on his chest. His heart was thumping with a steady 
beat. “He’s breathing,” I told her. 

I leaned into the mummy case. “Uncle Ben? Can you hear me? Uncle 
Ben?” 

He didn’t move. 

I lifted his hand and squeezed it. It felt warm, but limp. “Uncle Ben? 
Wake up!” I shouted. 

His eyes didn’t open. I lowered the hand back to the bottom of the 
mummy case. “He’s out cold,” I murmured. 

Sari stood behind me, both hands pressed against her cheeks. She 
stared down at Uncle Ben, her eyes wide with fear. “I—I don’t believe 
this!” she cried in a tiny voice. “Dr. Fielding left Daddy here to smother! If 
we hadn’t come along...” Her voice trailed off. 

Uncle Ben let out a low groan. 

Sari and I stared down at him hopefully. But he didn’t open his eyes. 

“We have to call the police,” I told Sari. “We have to tell them about 
Dr. Fielding.” 

“But we can’t just leave Daddy here,” Sari replied. 

I started to reply—but a frightening thought burst into my mind. I felt 
a shudder of fear roll down my body. “Sari?” I started. “If Uncle Ben is 
lying in the mummy case... then where is the mummy?” 

Her mouth dropped open. She stared back at me in stunned silence. 

And then we both heard the footsteps. 

Slow, scraping footsteps. 

And saw the mummy stagger stiffly into the room. 



21 


I opened my mouth to scream—but no sound came out. 

The mummy lurched stiffly through the chamber doorway. He stared 
straight ahead with his vacant, tarry eyes. Under the ancient layers of tar, 
the skull grinned at us. 

Scrape. Scrape. 

His feet dragged over the dirt floor, trailing shreds of decaying gauze. 
Slowly, he raised his arms, making a terrifying cracking sound. 

Scrape. Scrape. 

My throat tightened in terror. My entire body began to tremble. 

I backed away from the mummy case. Sari stood frozen with her hands 
pressed against her cheeks. I grabbed her arm and pulled her back with me. 
“Sari—get back! Get back!” I whispered. 

She stared in terror at the approaching mummy. I couldn’t tell if she 
heard me or not. I tugged her back further. 

Our backs hit the chamber wall. 

The mummy scraped closer. Closer. Staring at us through its vacant, 
blackened eye sockets, he reached for us with his yellowed, tar-encrusted 
hands. 

Sari let out a shrill shriek. 

“Run!” I screamed. “Sari—run!” 

But our backs were pressed against the wall. The mummy blocked our 
path to the doorway. 

Moving stiffly, awkwardly, the ancient corpse dragged itself closer. 

“This is all my fault!” I declared in a trembling voice. “I said the 
words five times. I brought him back to life!” 

“Wh-what can we do?” Sari cried in a hushed whisper. 

I didn’t have an answer. “Uncle Ben!” I shrieked desperately. “Uncle 
Ben—help us!” 

But the mummy case remained silent. Even my frantic screams could 
not awaken my uncle. 

Sari and I edged along the chamber wall, our eyes locked on the 
approaching mummy. Its bandaged feet scraped over the floor, sending up 



dark clouds of dust as it moved heavily toward us. 

A sour smell rose over the room. The smell of a four-thousand-year- 
old corpse coming to life. 

I pressed my back against the cold stone of the chamber wall, my mind 
racing. The mummy stopped at the mummy case, turned stiffly, and 
continued lurching toward us. 

“Hey—!” I cried out as an idea burst into my mind. 

My little mummy hand. The Summoner. 

Why hadn’t I thought of it before? It had saved us last summer by 
raising a group of ancient mummies from the dead. 

Could it also summon them to stop? Could it make them die again? 

If I raised the little mummy hand up to Prince Khor-Ru, would it stop 
him long enough for Sari and me to escape? 

He was only seconds away from grabbing us. 

It was worth a try. 

I reached into my back jeans pocket for the mummy hand. 

It was gone. 



22 


“No!” I uttered a surprised cry and frantically grabbed at my other pockets. 

No mummy hand. 

“Gabe—what’s wrong?” Sari demanded. 

“The mummy hand—it’s gone!” I told her, my voice choked with 
panic. 

Scrape. Scrape. 

The foul odor grew stronger as the ancient mummy dragged nearer. 

I was desperate to find my mummy hand. But I knew there was no 
time to think about it now. “We’ve got to make a run for it,” I told Sari. 
“The mummy is slow and stiff. If we can get past him...” 

“But what about Daddy?” she cried. “We can’t just leave him here.” 

“We have to,” I told her. “We’ll get help. We’ll come back for him.” 

The mummy made a brittle cracking sound as it stepped forward. The 
sound of an ancient bone breaking. 

But it continued toward us, moving stiffly but steadily, its arms 
outstretched. 

“Sari—run— now! ” I screamed. 

I gave her a hard shove to get her going. 

The room blurred as I forced myself to move. 

The mummy made another loud, cracking sound. It leaned its body 
forward, and reached out as we dodged around it. 

I tried to duck under the mummy’s outstretched hand. But I felt the 
scrape of its ancient fingers against the back of my neck—cold fingers, hard 
as a statue. 

I knew it was a touch I would never forget. 

My neck tingled. I lowered my head from his grasp—and plunged 
forward. 

Sari let out low sobs as she ran. My heart raced as I hurried to catch up 
to her. I forced myself to run, but my legs felt so heavy, as if they were 
made of solid stone. 

We were nearly to the doorway when we saw a flickering light. 



Sari and I both cried out and skidded to a stop as a beam of light swept 
into the room. Behind the light, a figure stepped into the doorway. 

Shielding my eyes from the sudden brightness, I squinted hard, eager 
to see who it was. 

“Nila!” I cried as she raised the flashlight beam to the ceiling. “Nila— 
help us!” I choked out. 

“He’s come alive!” Sari shouted to her. “Nila—he’s come alive!” She 
pointed back toward the mummy. 

“Help us!” I screamed. 

Nila’s green eyes widened in surprise. “What can I do?” she asked. 
And then her expression changed quickly to anger. “What can I do about 
you two kids? You shouldn’t be here. You’re going to ruin everything!” 

“Huh?” I cried out in surprise. 

Nila stepped into the room. She raised her right hand. 

In the dim light, I struggled to make out what she was holding up. 

My little mummy hand! 

She raised it toward the mummy. “Come to me, my brother!” Nila 
called. 



23 


“How did you get my mummy hand? What are you doing?” I demanded. 

Nila ignored my questions. She held the flashlight in one hand. She 
gripped the little hand in the other, holding it up toward the approaching 
mummy. 

“Come here, my brother!” she called, waving the hand, summoning 
the mummy. “It is I, Princess Nila!” 

Its legs cracking, its brittle bones breaking inside the gauze wrappings, 
the mummy obediently dragged itself forward. 

“Nila—stop it! What are you doing?” Sari shrieked. 

But Nila continued to ignore us. “It is I, your sister!” she called to the 
mummy. A triumphant smile crossed her pretty face. Her green eyes 
sparkled like flashing emeralds in the darting light. 

“I have waited so long for this day,” Nila told the mummy. “I have 
waited so many centuries, my brother, hoping that someday someone would 
uncover your tomb and we could be reunited.” 

Nila’s face glowed with excitement. The little mummy hand trembled 
in her hand. “I have brought you back to life, my brother!” she called to the 
mummy. “I have waited for centuries. But it will all be worth it. You and I 
will share all this treasure. And with our powers, we shall rule Egypt 
together—as we did four thousand years ago!” 

She lowered her eyes to me. “Thank you, Gabe!” she cried. “Thank 
you for The Summoner! As soon as I saw it, I knew I had to have it. I knew 
it could bring my brother back to me! The ancient words weren’t enough. I 
needed The Summoner, too!” 

“Give it back!” I demanded, reaching out for it. “It’s mine, Nila. Give 
it back.” 

A cruel laugh escaped her throat. “You won’t be needing it, Gabe,” she 
said softly. 

She waved the hand at the mummy. “Destroy them, my brother!” she 
ordered. “Destroy them now! There can be no witnesses!” 

“Nooo!” Sari shrieked. She and I both dove to the doorway. But Nila 
moved quickly to block our path. 



I shoved my shoulder against her, trying to push her away like a 
football lineman. But Nila held her ground with surprising strength. 

“Nila—let us go!” Sari demanded, breathing hard. 

Nila smiled and shook her head. “No witnesses,” she murmured. 

“Nila—we just want to get Daddy out of here. You can do what you 
want!” Sari insisted desperately. 

Nila ignored her and raised her eyes to the mummy. “Destroy them 
both!” she called. “They cannot leave this tomb alive!” 

Sari and I spun around to see the mummy lumbering toward us. Its 
blackened skull glowed in the dim light. It trailed long strips of yellowed 
gauze across the dirt floor as it dragged itself closer. 

Closer. 

I turned back to the door. Nila blocked the way. My eyes darted 
frantically around the chamber. 

No way to escape. 

No escape. 

The mummy lurched toward Sari and me. 

And reached out its cold, cold hands to obey Nila’s cruel command. 



24 


Sari and I darted toward the door. But Nila blocked our escape. 

Its vacant eyes gazing blindly at us, its jaw frozen in a hideous skeletal 
grin, the mummy hurtled toward us. 

Raised its arms stiffly. 

Stretched out its hands. 

Dove at us with a final, desperate lurch. 

And to my shock, reached past Sari and me—and wrapped its tarred 
hands around Nila’s throat. 

Her mouth opened in a choked cry of protest. 

The mummy tilted back its head as it gripped her. Its tarred lips 
moved, and a dry cough cut through the air. And then the whispered words, 
dry as death, escaped the mummy’s throat: 

“Let me ... rest in peace! ” 

Nila uttered a choked cry. 

The mummy tightened its fierce grip on her throat. 

I spun around and grabbed its arm. “Let her go!” I screamed. 

A dry wheeze erupted from the blackened skull. Its hands tightened 
around Nila, bending her back, bending her toward the floor. 

Nila’s eyes shut in defeat. Her hands flew up helplessly. The flashlight 
and the mummy hand fell to the floor. 

I grabbed my little mummy hand and shoved it into my jeans pocket. 
“Let go! Let go! Let go!” I shrieked. I leaped on to the mummy’s back and 
tried to pull its hands from Nila’s throat. 

It let out a defiant roar, a harsh whisper of anger. 

Then it heaved itself up straight and struggled to toss me off its 
shoulders. 

I gasped, startled by the mummy’s surprising strength. 

As I started to slide off the mummy’s bandaged back, I reached out my 
hand, grabbing desperately, grabbing air, trying not to fall. 

My hand grabbed onto Nila’s amber pendant. 

“Hey—!” I cried out as the mummy gave a hard toss. 



I tumbled off. 

The pendant tore off its chain. It fell from my hand, crashed to the 
floor—and shattered. 

“Noooooooooo!” Nila’s horrified wail shook the walls. 

The mummy froze. 

Nila spun out of the mummy’s grasp. Backed away. Her eyes wide 
with terror. “My life! My life]” she shrieked. 

She bent and struggled to pick up shards of amber from the floor. But 
the pendant had shattered into a hundred tiny pieces. 

“My life!” Nila wailed, staring at the smooth pieces in her palm. She 
raised her eyes to Sari and me. “I lived inside the pendant!” she cried. “At 
night, I crept inside. It kept me alive for over four thousand years! And 
now... now... ohhhhh...” 

As her voice trailed off, Nila began to shrink. 

Her head, her arms, her entire body grew tinier... tinier... until she 
disappeared into her clothes. 

And a few seconds later, as Sari and I gaped down in horror and shock, 
a black scarab crawled out from under the sweatshirt and jeans. The scarab 
moved unsteadily at first. Then it quickly scuttled away over the dirt floor, 
disappearing into the darkness. 

“That—that beetle—” Sari stammered. “Is it Nila?” 

I nodded. “I guess,” I said, staring down at Nila’s crumpled clothes. 

“Do you think she was really an ancient Egyptian princess? Prince 
Khor-Ru’s sister?” Sari murmured. 

“It’s all so weird,” I replied. I was thinking hard, trying to piece it all 
together, trying to make sense of what Nila had said. 

“She must have returned to her scarab form every night,” I told Sari, 
thinking out loud. “She crawled into the amber and slept inside it. It kept 
her alive—until...” 

“Until you smashed the amber pendant,” Sari whispered. 

“Yes.” I nodded. “It was an accident—” I started. 

But I choked on my words as I felt a cold hand close on my shoulder. 

And knew that the mummy had grabbed me from behind. 



25 


The hand rested on my shoulder. The cold seeped through my T-shirt. “Let 
go!” I screamed. 

I spun around—and my heart skipped a beat. “Uncle Ben!” I cried. 

“Daddy!” Sari leaped forward and threw her arms around him. “Daddy 
—you’re okay!” 

He pulled his hand off my shoulder and rubbed the back of his head. 
He blinked his eyes uncertainly and shook his head, still a little dazed. 

Behind him, I saw the mummy standing hunched over, frozen. Lifeless 
once again. 

“Whew. I’m still groggy,” Uncle Ben said, sweeping a hand back 
through his thick, black hair. “What a close call.” 

“It’s all my fault,” I admitted. “I repeated the words five times, Uncle 
Ben. I didn’t mean to bring the mummy back to life, but—” 

A smile crossed my uncle’s face. He lowered his arm around my 
shoulders. “You didn’t do it, Gabe,” he said softly. “Nila got there first.” 

He sighed. “I didn’t believe in the power of the chant,” he said softly. 
“But I do now. Nila stole your mummy hand and chanted the ancient words. 
She used The Summoner to bring the mummy to life. Dr. Fielding and I 
were both suspicious of her.” 

“You were?” I cried, surprised. “But I thought—” 

“I became suspicious of Nila at dinner,” Uncle Ben explained. 
“Remember? She asked me what were the six ancient words to bring the 
dead to life? Well, I had never revealed that there were six. So I wondered 
how Nila knew there were six words.” 

Uncle Ben put an arm around Sari’s shoulders, too, and led us to the 
wall. Then he leaned his back against the wall, rubbing the back of his 
head. 

“That’s why I hurried to the communications tent right after dinner,” 
Uncle Ben continued. “I phoned the Cairo Sun. They had never heard of 
Nila at the newspaper. So I knew she was a fake.” 

“But we saw Dr. Fielding pull you from the tent,” Sari broke in. “We 
saw him force you into the pyramid, and—” 



Unde Ben chuckled. “You two aren’t very good spies,” he scolded. 
“Dr. Fielding didn’t force me to do anything. He had spotted Nila sneaking 
into the pyramid. So he found me at the communications tent. And the two 
of us hurried to the pyramid to see what Nila was up to. 

“We got there too late,” Uncle Ben continued. “She had already 
brought the mummy to life. Dr. Fielding and I tried to stop her. She hit me 
over the head with her flashlight. She dragged me to the mummy case. I 
guess she stuffed me inside.” 

He rubbed his head. “That’s all I remember. Until now. Until I awoke 
and saw Nila turn into a scarab.” 

“We saw Dr. Fielding hurry out of the pyramid,” Sari reported. “He 
walked right past me. He had the weirdest look on his face, and—” 

She stopped and her mouth dropped open. We all heard the sounds at 
the same time. 

The scraping of feet on the floor outside the burial chamber. 

My heart jumped to my throat. I grabbed Uncle Ben’s arm. 

The footsteps dragged closer. 

More mummies. 

More mummies brought to life, staggering toward the prince’s tomb. 



26 


I reached into my jeans pocket for my little mummy hand. Pressing my 
back against the wall, I raised my eyes to the chamber doorway—and 
waited. 

Waited for the mummies to appear. 

But to my surprise, Dr. Fielding burst into the room, followed by four 
dark-uniformed police officers, hands at their gun holsters. 

“Ben—are you okay?” Dr. Fielding called to my uncle. “Where is the 
young woman?” 

“She... escaped,” Uncle Ben told him. 

How could he explain that she had turned into a bug? 

The police explored the chamber warily. Their eyes came to rest on the 
mummy, frozen in place near the doorway. 

“I’m so glad you’re okay, Ben,” Dr. Fielding said, placing a hand 
warmly on Uncle Ben’s shoulder. Then he turned to Sari. “I’m afraid I owe 
you an apology, Sari,” he said, frowning. “When I ran out of here, I must 
have been in shock. I remember seeing you outside the pyramid. But I don’t 
remember saying anything to you.” 

“That’s okay,” Sari replied quietly. 

“I’m really sorry if I frightened you,” Dr. Fielding told her. “Your dad 
had been knocked unconscious by that crazy young woman. And all I could 
think about was calling the police as fast as possible.” 

“Well, the excitement is over,” Uncle Ben said, smiling. “Let’s all get 
out of here.” 

We started toward the doorway, but a police officer interrupted. “Could 
I just ask one question?” he asked, staring at the upright mummy in the 
center of the floor. “Did that mummy walk?” 

“Of course not!” Uncle Ben replied quickly, a grin spreading over his 
face. “If it could walk, what would it be doing in this dump?” 

Well, once again, I turned out to be the hero of the day. And, of course, later 
in the tent, I wasted no time in bragging about my courage to Sari. 
'Sari had no choice. She had to sit there and take it. After all, / was the 
one who had stopped the mummy and turned Nila back into a beetle by 
smashing her pendant. 

“At least you’re not too conceited!” Sari shot back, rolling her eyes. 

Lame. Really lame. 

“Well, that scarab crawled away and disappeared,” she said. An evil 
smile crossed Sari’s lips. “I’ll bet that bug is waiting for you, Gabe. I’ll bet 
it’s waiting for you in your cot, waiting to bite you.” 

I laughed. “Sari, you’d say anything to try to scare me. You just can’t 
stand the idea that I’m the hero!” 

“You’re right,” she replied dryly. “I can’t stand the idea. Good night, 
Gabe.” 

A few minutes later, I was in my pajamas and ready for bed. What a 
night! What an amazing night! 

As I slid into the cot and pulled up the covers, I knew it was a night I 
would never forget. 

“Ouch!” 




PHANTOM OF THE 
AUDITORIUM 
Goosebumps - 24 
R.L. Stine 


1 


A mysterious phantom haunted our school. 

No one ever saw him. No one knew where he lived. 

But he haunted our school for more than seventy years. 

My best friend, Zeke, and I were the ones who found him. We found him 
while we were doing a school play about a phantom. 

Our teacher told us that the play was cursed, but we didn’t believe her. We 
thought it was all just a big joke. 

But when I saw the Phantom for myself, I knew it was no joke. It was all 
true. Every bit of it. 

The night we found the Phantom was the scariest night of our lives! 

But I should start at the beginning. 

My name is Brooke Rodgers, and I’m in the sixth grade at Woods Mill 
Middle School. 

Zeke Matthews is my best friend. A lot of the other girls think it’s weird 
that my best friend is a boy, but I don’t care. Zeke is cooler and funnier than any 
girls I know. He is also a big horror movie fan, like me. 

Zeke and I have been best friends for nine years. We know just about 
everything about each other. For instance, I know that Zeke still wears Kermit 
the Frog pajamas! 

He hates it when I tell people that. His face always turns a bright shade of 
red. Then his freckles stand out even more. 

Zeke hates his freckles almost as much as I hate my glasses. I don’t know 
why he’s so hung up over a couple of freckles. After a while, you hardly even 
notice them. And in the summer when he gets tan, they practically disappear 
altogether. 

I wish my glasses could disappear. They make me look so nerdy. But if I 
don’t wear them, I walk into walls! 

Some girls at school think Zeke is cute. I never think about him that way. I 
guess it’s because I’ve known him for nearly my entire life. Ever since our 
moms met in their bowling league and discovered they lived on the same street. 

The excitement about the Phantom started a couple of Fridays ago. School 
had ended for the day, and I was trying to get my locker open. I pushed my hair 



off my face and turned the combination dial. The stupid lock always jams, and it 
drives me crazy. 

After trying the combination four times, I finally got it open. I threw my 
books inside and slammed the door shut. No way was I dragging home any 
textbooks over the weekend. As of right this second, I was on vacation! Two 
whole days of no school. 

Excellent. 

Before I could turn around, a fist came whizzing by my ear and punched 
my locker with a loud bang! 

“What’s up, Brookie?” a voice called from behind me. “No homework this 
weekend?” 

I didn’t have to turn around to know who it was. Only one person in the 
whole world can ever get away with calling me Brookie. 

I turned around to see Zeke’s dopey grin. His blond hair, which was really 
long in the front and very short—almost shaved—in the back, fell over one eye. 

I smiled, then stuck my tongue out at him. 

“Real mature, Brookie,” he muttered. 

Then I flipped my eyelids up so they stayed that way. It’s a really gross 
talent I have that usually makes people scream and gag. 

Zeke didn’t bat an eye. He has seen my eyelid trick at least a zillion times. 

“Nope, no homework!” I replied. “No books. No nothing. I’m totally free 
this weekend.” 

Then I got a great idea. “Hey, Zeke,” I said, “do you think Rich can take us 
to see the Creature festival tomorrow?” 

I was dying to see the three Creature movies playing at the Cineplex. One 
was supposed to be in 3-D! Zeke and I go to scary movies all the time just to 
laugh at the scary parts. We have nerves of steel. We never get scared. 

“Maybe,” Zeke answered, brushing his hair away from his face. “But Rich 
is grounded. He can’t use the car for a week.” 

Rich is Zeke’s older brother. He spends most of his life being grounded. 

Zeke shifted his backpack onto his other shoulder. “Forget about the 
Creature festival, Brooke. Aren’t you forgetting something?” He narrowed his 
eyes at me. “Something big?” 

I scrunched up my nose. Forgetting something? I couldn’t think of a thing. 
“What?” I asked finally. 

“Come on, Brookie! Think!” 



I really had no idea what Zeke was talking about. I pulled my long hair into 
a ponytail and tied it together with the hair scrunchie that was on my wrist. 

I always wear a hair scrunchie on each wrist. I like to be prepared. You 
never know when you’re going to need a hair scrunchie. 

“Really, Zeke, I don’t know,” I said, making a tight ponytail. “Why don’t 
you just tell me?” 

And that’s when it hit me. “The cast list!” I yelled, slapping my forehead. 
How could I have forgotten? Zeke and I had been waiting two long weeks to find 
out if we got parts in the school play. 

“Come on! Let’s check it out!” I grabbed hold of Zeke’s flannel shirtsleeve. 
And I pulled him all the way to the auditorium. 

Zeke and I had both tried out for the play. Last year, we had small parts in 
the musical Guys and Dolls. Ms. Walker, our teacher, told us that the play this 
year was going to be scary. 

That’s all Zeke and I had to hear. We had to be in this play! 

We found a big crowd of kids at the bulletin board. They were all trying to 
read the cast list at once. 

I was so nervous! “I can’t look, Zeke!” I cried. “You check, okay?” 

“Yeah, no prob—” 

“Wait! I’ll do it!” I yelled, changing my mind. I do that a lot. Zeke says it 
drives him crazy. 

I took a deep breath and pushed through the crowd of kids. Biting my left 
thumbnail, I crossed the fingers on my right hand and stared up at the list. 

But when I saw what was posted up there, I nearly bit off my whole thumb! 

Tacked on the board beside the cast list was a sign: 

Attention Brooke Rodgers: Please report to Mr. Levy’s office. You have 
been suspended from school. 



2 


Suspended? 

I gasped in shock. 

Had Mr. Levy found out that I was the one who let the gerbil loose in the 
teachers’ lounge? 

Suspended. 

I felt sick to my stomach. My parents were going to be so horrified. 

Then I heard giggling. 

I spun around to find Zeke laughing his head off. Other kids were laughing, 

too. 

I stared angrily at Zeke. “Did you put that sign up?” 

“Of course! ” he replied, laughing even harder. 

He has a sick sense of humor. 

“I didn’t believe it for a second,” I lied. 

I turned back to the board to read the cast list. I had to read the list three 
times. I couldn’t believe what I saw. “Zeke!” I shouted over the other kids’ 
heads. “You and I—we’re the stars!” 

Zeke’s mouth dropped open in surprise. Then he grinned at me. “Yeah. For 
sure,” he muttered, rolling his eyes. 

“No. Really!” I cried. “We got the two biggest parts! Come check it out for 
yourself! You got the part of the Phantom!” 

“No way!” Zeke still didn’t believe me. 

“She’s telling the truth, Zeke,” a girl behind me said. Tina Powell, a 
seventh-grader, pushed through the crowd. 

I always get the feeling that Tina Powell doesn’t like me very much. I have 
no idea why. I hardly even know her. But she always seems to be frowning at 
me. Like I have a piece of spinach caught on my tooth or something. 

“Let me see that list!” Zeke demanded, pushing past everyone. “Wow! I did 
get the starring part!” 

“I’m going to be Esmerelda,” I read. “I wonder who Esmerelda is. Hey, 
maybe she’s the Phantom’s crazy old stepmother, or maybe she’s the headless 
wife who comes back from the dead to—” 

“Give it a rest, Brooke,” Tina said, frowning at me. “Esmerelda is just the 



daughter of some guy who owns a theater.” She said it as if Esmerelda were a 
nothing part. 

“Uh, what part did you get, Tina?” I asked. 

Tina shifted uncomfortably. A few other kids turned to hear her reply. 

“I’m your understudy!” she muttered, staring down at the floor. “So if you 
get sick or something and you can’t be in the show, I’ll play the part of 
Esmerelda. 

“I’m also in charge of all the scenery!” she boasted. 

I wanted to say something mean and nasty, something to put Miss High- 
and-Mighty Tina Powell in her place in front of everybody. But I couldn’t think 
of anything. 

I’m not a mean, nasty person. And it’s hard to think of mean, nasty things to 
say—even when I want to. 

So I decided to ignore her. I was too excited about the play to let Tina 
Powell get to me. 

I pulled on my denim jacket and swung my backpack over my shoulder. 
“Come on, Phantom,” I said to Zeke. “Let’s go haunt the neighborhood!” 

On Monday afternoon, we started rehearsing the play. Ms. Walker, my teacher, 
was in charge. 

She stood on the stage in the auditorium, staring down at us. She clutched a 
tall stack of scripts in her arms. 

Ms. Walker has curly red hair and pretty green eyes. She is very skinny, as 
skinny as a pencil. She is a very good teacher—a little too strict. But a good 
teacher. 

Zeke and I chose two seats next to each other in the third row. I glanced 
around at the other kids. Everyone was talking. Everyone seemed really excited. 

“Do you know what this play is about?” Corey Sklar asked me. He was 
playing my father. I mean, Esmerelda’s father. Corey has chestnut-brown hair 
like me. And he also wears glasses. Maybe that’s why we were playing relatives. 

“Beats me,” I answered him with a shrug. “Nobody knows what the play is 
about. I just know it’s supposed to be scary.” 

“I know what it’s about!” Tina Powell announced loudly. 

I turned around in my seat. “How do you know?” I demanded. “Ms. Walker 
hasn’t passed out the scripts yet.” 

“My great-grandfather went to Woods Mill Middle School a long, long time 



ago. He told me all about The Phantom, ” Tina bragged. 

I started to tell Tina that nobody cared about her great-grandfather’s dumb 
story. But then she added, “He also told me about the curse on the play!” 

That shut everyone up. Even me. 

Even Ms. Walker was listening now. 

Zeke nudged me, his eyes wide with excitement. “A curse?” he whispered 
happily. “Cool!” 

I nodded. “Very cool,” I muttered. 

“My great-grandfather told me a really scary story about this play,” Tina 
continued. “And he told me about a phantom in the school. A real phantom who 

55 

“Tina!” Ms. Walker interrupted, stepping to the front of the stage. She 
peered down sharply at Tina. “I really don’t think you should tell that story 
today.” 

“Huh? Why not?” I cried. 

“Yeah. Why not?” Zeke joined in. 

“I don’t think this is a good time to listen to scary stories that may not be 
true,” Ms. Walker replied sternly. “Today I’m going to pass out the scripts, and 

55 

“Do you know the story?” Tina demanded. 

“Yes, I’ve heard it,” Ms. Walker told her. “But I wish you would keep it to 
yourself, Tina. It’s a very scary story. Very upsetting. And I really don’t think—” 

“Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!” Zeke started to chant. 

And, instantly, we were all grinning up at our teacher and chanting loudly: 
“Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!” 

Why didn’t Ms. Walker want us to hear the story? I wondered. 

How scary could it be? 



3 


“Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!” we all continued to chant. 

Ms. Walker raised both hands for us to be silent. 

But that only made us stamp our feet in time to our chanting. 

“Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!” 

“Okay!” she shouted finally. “Okay, I’ll tell you the story. But, remember— 
it’s just a story. I don’t want you to get too scared.” 

“You can’t scare us/” Zeke cried. 

Everyone laughed. But I was staring hard at Ms. Walker. I could see that 
she really didn’t want us to know this story. 

Ms. Walker always said we could talk about anything we wanted to with 
her. I began to wonder why she didn’t want to talk about the Phantom. 

“The story starts seventy-two years ago,” Ms. Walker began, “the year 
Woods Mill Middle School was first built. I guess Tina’s great-grandfather was a 
student here that year.” 

“Yes, he was,” Tina called out. “He was in the first class that went to this 
school. He told me there were only twenty-five kids in the whole school.” 

Ms. Walker crossed her skinny arms over the front of her yellow sweater 
and continued her story. “The students wanted to put on a play. A boy was 
hunting around in the basement of the Old Woods Mill Library. He found a script 
down there. It was called The Phantom. 

“It was a very scary play about a girl who is kidnapped by a mysterious 
phantom. The boy showed it to his teacher. The teacher decided it would be fun 
to perform the play. It would be a grand production with the best scary special 
effects they could create.” 

Zeke and I exchanged excited glances. The play had special effects! We 
loved special effects! 

“Rehearsals for The Phantom began,” Ms. Walker continued. “The boy who 
had discovered the play at the library won the lead role of The Phantom. ” 

Everybody turned to look at Zeke. He smiled proudly, as if he had 
something to do with it. 

“They practiced the play after school every day,” Ms. Walker continued. 
“Everyone was having a really good time. Everyone was working really hard to 



make it a good play. It was all going smoothly, until—until—” 

She hesitated. 

“Tell us!” I called out loudly. 

“Tell us! Tell us!” a few kids started chanting again. 

“I want you all to remember this is just a story,” Ms. Walker said again. 
“There’s no proof that it ever happened.” 

We all nodded. 

Ms. Walker cleared her throat, then continued. “On the night of the play, the 
kids were all in costume. Parents and friends filled the auditorium. This 
auditorium. The kids were really excited and nervous. 

“Their teacher called them together to give them a pep talk. The play was 
about to start. But to everyone’s surprise, the boy playing the Phantom was 
nowhere to be found.” 

Ms. Walker began pacing back and forth on the stage as she continued the 
story. “They called to him. They looked for him backstage. But they couldn’t 
find the Phantom, the star of the show. 

“They spread out. They searched everywhere. But they couldn’t find him. 
The boy had vanished. 

“They searched for an hour,” Ms. Walker continued. “Everyone was so 
upset, so frightened. Especially the boy’s parents. 

“Finally, the teacher stepped out onstage to announce that the play could not 
go on. But before she could speak, a horrible scream rang out over the 
auditorium.” 

Ms. Walker stopped pacing. “It was a frightening scream. People said it was 
like an animal howl. 

“The teacher ran toward the sound. She called to the boy. But now there 
was only silence. A heavy silence. No more screams. 

“Once again, the entire school was searched. But the boy was never found.” 

Ms. Walker swallowed hard. 

We were all silent. No one even breathed! 

“He was never seen again,” she repeated. “I guess you could say that the 
Phantom became a real phantom. He just disappeared. And the play was never 
performed.” 

She stopped pacing and stared out at us. Her eyes moved from seat to seat. 

“Weird,” someone behind me murmured. 

“Do you think it’s true?” I heard a boy whisper. 



And then, beside me, Corey Sklar let out a gasp. “Oh, no!” he cried, 
pointing to the side door. “There he is! There’s the Phantom!” 

I turned—along with everyone else—and saw the hideous face of the 
Phantom, grinning at us from the doorway. 



4 


Corey Sklar screamed. 

A lot of kids screamed. I think even Tina screamed. 

The Phantom’s face was twisted in an ugly grin. His bright red hair stood 
straight up on his head. One eyeball bulged out from its socket. Black stitches 
covered a deep scar that ran all the way down the side of his face. 

“BOO!” the Phantom yelled, bursting into the aisle. 

More screams. 

I just laughed. I knew it was Zeke. 

I had seen him wear that dumb mask before. He kept it in his locker in case 
he needed it. 

“Zeke, give us a break!” I called. 

He pulled the mask off by the hair. His face was red underneath it. Zeke 
grinned at everyone. He knew he had just pulled off a really good joke. 

Kids were laughing now. 

Someone threw an empty milk container at Zeke. Another kid tried to trip 
Zeke as he headed back to his seat. 

“Very funny, Zeke,” Ms. Walker said, rolling her eyes. “I hope we won’t 
have any more visits from the Phantom!” 

Zeke dropped back into the seat next to me. “Why did you scare everyone 
like that?” I whispered. 

“Felt like it.” Zeke grinned back at me. 

“So, will we be the first kids to perform this play?” Corey asked Ms. 
Walker. 

Our teacher nodded. “Yes, we will. After the boy disappeared seventy-two 
years ago, the school decided to destroy all the scripts and the scenery. But one 
copy of the script was kept, locked up in the school vault for all these years. And 
now we’re going to perform The Phantom for the first time!” 

Kids started talking excitedly. It took Ms. Walker a while to quiet us down. 

“Now listen,” she said, putting her hands on her pencil-thin waist. “This 
was just a story. An old school legend. I’ll bet even Tina’s great-grandfather will 
tell you that it isn’t true. I only told it to put you all in a horror mood.” 

“But what about the curse?” I shouted up to her. “Tina said there was a 



curse!” 

“Yes,” Tina called out. “My great-grandfather said the play is cursed. The 
Phantom won’t let anyone perform it. Grandpa says the Phantom is still here in 
the school. The Phantom has been haunting the school for over seventy years! 
But no one has ever seen him.” 

“Excellent!” Zeke declared, his eyes lighting up. 

Some kids laughed. Some kids looked kind of uncomfortable. Kind of 
scared. 

“I told you, it’s just a story,” Ms. Walker said. “Now, let’s get down to 
business, okay? Who wants to help me pass the scripts out? I’ve made a copy for 
each of you. I want you to take them home and begin studying your parts.” 

Zeke and I practically fell over each other running up to the stage to help 
Ms. Walker. She handed us each a stack of scripts. We climbed back down and 
started to hand them out. When I came to Corey, he pulled his hand back. “Wh- 
what if the curse is true?” he called up to Ms. Walker. 

“Corey, please,” she insisted. “Enough talk about the Phantom and the 
curse, okay? We have a lot of work to do, and—” 

She didn’t finish. 

Instead, she screamed. 

I turned back to the stage, where Ms. Walker had been standing a second 
before. 

She was gone. 

She had vanished into thin air. 



5 


The scripts fell from my hands. 

I turned and made a dash for the stage. I heard kids shouting and crying out 
in surprise. 

“She just disappeared!” I heard Corey utter. 

“But that’s impossible! ” a girl shrieked. 

Zeke and I scrambled onstage together. “Ms. Walker—where are you?” I 
called. “Ms. Walker?” 

Silence. 

“Ms. Walker? Can you hear me?” Zeke called. 

Then I heard Ms. Walker’s faint cry for help. “I’m down here!” she called. 

“Down where?” Zeke cried. 

“Down here!” 

Down below the stage? That’s where her voice seemed to be coming from. 

“Help me up!” Ms. Walker called again. 

What’s going on here? I wondered. How come we can hear her, but we 
can’t see her? 

I was the first to spot the big, square hole in the stage. Zeke and the other 
kids gathered around it. I stepped to the edge of the opening and peered down. 

Ms. Walker stared up at me. She was standing on a small, square platform, 
five or six feet below the stage. “You’ll have to raise the platform,” she said. 

“How do we bring it up?” Zeke asked. 

“Press that peg. Over there on the stage,” Ms. Walker instructed. She 
pointed to a small wooden peg to the right of the trapdoor. 

“Got it!” Zeke cried. He pushed down the peg. We heard a clanking sound. 
Then a grinding sound. Then a groaning sound. 

Slowly, the platform came rising up. Ms. Walker stepped off the platform. 
She grinned at us and brushed off the back of her blue slacks. “I forgot about the 
trapdoor,” she said. “I could have broken a leg or something. But I think I’m 
okay.” 

We all gathered around. Zeke dropped down on his hands and knees, staring 
down at the trapdoor. 



“I forgot to mention the best part about this play,” Ms. Walker told us. “This 
trapdoor was built for the first production of The Phantom. It was totally 
forgotten. It’s never been used in a school play—until now!” 

My mouth dropped open. A trapdoor! How awesome! 

Ms. Walker reached down and tugged Zeke back from the opening. 
“Careful. YouTl fall,” she said. “I lowered the platform earlier. I forgot it was 
still down.” 

Zeke climbed to his feet. I could see he was really interested in the trapdoor. 

“When The Phantom was first supposed to be performed,” Ms. Walker told 
us, “the school had this trapdoor built so that the Phantom could disappear or 
rise up from below. Back then, it was a very impressive special effect.” 

I turned my eyes to Zeke. He seemed about to explode with excitement. 
“Am I the only one who gets to use it in the play?” he asked eagerly. “Can I try it 
now? Please?” 

“Not yet, Zeke,” Ms. Walker replied firmly. “I still need to have it checked 
out for safety reasons. Until it has been checked, I don’t want anybody fooling 
with the trapdoor.” 

Zeke was already back on his hands and knees, inspecting the trapdoor. 

Ms. Walker cleared her throat loudly. “Is that clear? Zeke?” she asked. 

Zeke glanced up. He sighed. “Yes, Ms. Walker,” he muttered. 

“Good,” Ms. Walker said. “Now let’s get back to our seats. I’d like to read 
through the play once before we leave today. Just to give you an idea of the story 
and the characters.” 

We returned to our seats. Zeke’s expression caught my eye. I’d seen that 
look on his face before. His forehead was wrinkled, and his left eyebrow was up. 
I could tell he was deep in thought. 

It took more than an hour to read through the play. The Phantom was a 
really scary play! 

It was about a man named Carlo who owns a very old theater where plays 
and concerts are performed. Carlo thinks his theater is haunted. 

It turns out that there really is a phantom living in the basement. His face is 
scarred. He looks like a monster. So he wears a mask. But Carlo’s daughter, 
Esmerelda, falls in love with the Phantom. She plans to run away with him. But 
her handsome boyfriend, Eric, finds out. 

Eric is in love with Esmerelda. He tracks down the Phantom in his secret 
home in a dark passage far beneath the theater. They fight. And Eric kills the 



Phantom. 

This breaks Esmerelda’s heart. She runs away, never to be seen again. And 
the Phantom survives as a ghost. He will haunt the theater forever. 

Pretty dramatic, huh? 

I think we all enjoyed reading through the play. We could see that it was 
going to be a lot of fun to perform. 

When I read my lines as Esmerelda, I tried to picture what it would be like 
to be in costume, saying the lines onstage. Once, I glanced back and saw Tina 
mouthing my lines silently to herself. 

She stopped when she caught me watching her. 

She frowned at me the way she always does. 

Tina is totally jealous, I told myself. She really wants to be Esmerelda. 

For a moment, I felt bad for Tina. I didn’t like Tina very much. But I didn’t 
want her to hate me because I had the part she wanted to play. 

But I didn’t have much time to think about Tina. I had a lot of lines to read. 
Esmerelda was onstage a lot in this play. It was a really big part. 

When we finally finished reading the play, we all clapped and cheered. 

“Okay. Go home, everyone,” Ms. Walker instructed, waving us to the door. 
“Start learning your parts. We’ll meet again tomorrow.” 

As I began to follow the other kids to the door, I felt a hand pull me back. I 
turned to find Zeke pulling me behind a wide concrete beam. 

“Zeke—what are you doing?” I demanded. 

He raised a finger to his lips. “Shhhh.” His eyes were really excited. “Let 
them all go,” he whispered. 

I peeked out from behind the pillar. Ms. Walker lowered the lights. Then 
she collected her papers and made her way out through the auditorium door. 

“Why are we hiding here?” I whispered impatiently. 

Zeke grinned at me. “Let’s try out the trapdoor,” he whispered back. 

“Huh?” 

“Let’s try it out. Quick. While there’s no one in here.” 

I glanced quickly around the auditorium. Dark. And empty. 

“Come on. Don’t be a wimp,” Zeke urged, pulling me toward the stage. 
“Let’s try it out, okay? What could happen?” 

I turned uncertainly to the stage. “Okay,” I said. 

Zeke was right. What could happen?

Zeke and I climbed on to the stage. It was darker than before. And it felt colder. 

Our sneakers thudded over the floorboards. Every sound seemed to echo 
over the whole auditorium. 

“This trapdoor is so cool!” Zeke exclaimed. “Too bad you don’t get to use it 
in the play.” 

I gave him a playful shove and started to reply. But I suddenly felt one of 
my sneezing attacks coming on. The dusty auditorium curtain must have 
triggered my allergies. 

I have the worst allergies in creation. I am allergic to absolutely everything. 
You name it. Dust, pollen, cats, dogs—even some sweaters. 

When I have an allergy attack, sometimes I sneeze thirteen or fourteen 
times in a row. My all-time record is seventeen. 

Zeke likes to count my sneezes. He thinks he’s a riot. He slaps the floor and 
yells, “Seven! Eight! Nine!” 

Ha-ha. After ten sneezes in a row, I’m in no mood for jokes. I’m usually a 
pitiful, dripping mess with foggy glasses. 

We tiptoed over to the trapdoor. “Check the floor around there,” Zeke said 
quietly. “Find that peg that makes it work.” 

Zeke stood on the trapdoor while I searched for the peg in the darkness. I 
desperately tried to hold in my sneezes, but it wasn’t easy. 

Then the small peg on the stage floor caught my eye. “Hey—I found it!” I 
shouted happily. 

Zeke glanced nervously around the auditorium. “Ssshhh! Someone will 
hear you!” 

“Sorry,” I whispered. Then I realized I couldn’t hold out any longer. My 
eyes were watering like crazy, and I just had to sneeze. 

I grabbed a handful of tissues from my pocket and put the whole wad up to 
my nose. Then I started sneezing. I tried to keep them as silent as possible. 

“Four! Five!” Zeke counted. 

Fuckily, it wasn’t a record-breaking attack. I only made it to seven. I wiped 
my nose and shoved the dirty tissues in my pocket. It was gross, but I had 
nowhere else to throw them. 



“Okay, Zeke, here goes!” I cried. 

I stepped on the peg and jumped beside Zeke on the trapdoor. 

We heard a clanking sound. Then a rumbling. Then a grinding. 

The square section of floor began to lower itself. 

Zeke grabbed my arm. “Hey—this thing is kind of shaky!” he cried. 

“You’re not scared—are you!” I challenged him. 

“No way!” he insisted. 

The clanking grew louder. The square platform shook beneath us as we slid 
down. Down, down—until the stage disappeared, and we were surrounded by 
darkness. 

I expected the platform to come to a stop just beneath the stage. That’s 
where it stopped for Ms. Walker. 

But, to my surprise, the platform kept dropping. 

And it picked up speed as it slid farther and farther down. 

“Hey—what’s happening?” Zeke cried, holding on to my arm. 

“How far down does this thing go?” I wondered out loud. 

“Ohh!” Zeke and I both cried out as the platform finally hit the bottom with 
a hard thud! 

We were both thrown to the floor. 

I scrambled to my feet quickly. “Are you okay?” 

“Yeah. I guess.” Zeke definitely sounded scared. 

We seemed to be in a long, black tunnel. 

Dark. And silent. 

I don’t like to admit it. But I was very close to being scared, too. 

Suddenly the silence was broken by a soft, raspy noise. 

I felt panic choke my throat. That sound. What was it? 

The sound repeated softly, steadily. 

Like breathing. 

My heart pounded in my chest. Yes! Breathing. The raspy breathing of a 
strange creature. So close to me. 

Right next to me. 

Zeke! 

“Zeke—why are you breathing like that?” I demanded, feeling my heartbeat 
slow to normal. 

“Breathing like what?” he whispered. 



“Oh. Never mind,” I muttered. He was breathing that way because he was 
scared. We were both scared. But there was no way we would ever admit it to 
each other. 

We both raised our eyes to the auditorium ceiling. It was a small, square 
glow in the far distance. It seemed to be miles and miles above us. 

Zeke turned to me. “Where do you think we are?” 

“We’re about a mile beneath the stage,” I replied, feeling a chill. 

“No kidding, Sherlock,” Zeke replied nastily. 

“If you’re so smart, you tell me!” I challenged him. 

“I don’t think it’s the basement,” he said thoughtfully. “I think we’re way 
below the basement.” 

“It feels like it’s a big tunnel or something,” I said, trying to keep my voice 
from shaking. “Want to explore?” 

He didn’t answer for a long moment. “Too dark to explore,” he replied 
finally. 

I didn’t really want to explore. I was just pretending to be brave. Usually, I 
liked having the creeps. But being way down here was too creepy, even for me. 

“We’ll come back with flashlights,” Zeke said softly. 

“Yeah. Flashlights,” I repeated. I didn’t plan to ever come back! 

I played nervously with the denim hair scrunchie on my wrist and stared out 
into the darkness. Something bothered me. Something didn’t make sense. 

“Zeke,” I said thoughtfully, “why would the stage trapdoor come all the 
way down here?” 

“I don’t know. Maybe so the Phantom can get home quicker after he haunts 
the auditorium!” Zeke joked. 

I punched him in the arm. “No jokes about the Phantom—okay?” 

If there really is a phantom, I told myself, this is where he would live. 

“Let’s get out of here!” Zeke said, staring up at the square of light so far 
above our heads. “I’m going to be late for dinner.” 

“Yeah, sure,” I replied, folding my arms across my chest. “Just one 
question, Mr. Know-It-All.” 

“What question?” Zeke asked uncertainly. 

“How do we get back up?” 

We both thought about that one for a while. 

After a minute or so, I saw Zeke drop to his knees and begin running his 
hand along the platform floor. “There’s got to be a peg to push down here,” he 



said. 

“No. The peg is up there,” I replied, pointing way up to the stage floor. 

“Then there’s got to be a switch or a lever or a button to push!” Zeke cried. 
His voice grew high and shrill. 

“Where? Where could it be?” My voice sounded just as shrill, just as 
frightened. 

We both started feeling around in the darkness, feeling for something we 
could push, or pull, or turn. Something to make the little square platform rise up 
again and carry us back up to the auditorium. 

But after a few minutes of desperate searching, I gave up. 

“We’re trapped down here, Zeke,” I murmured. “We’re trapped.” 



7 


“This is all your fault,” I muttered. 

I don’t know why I said that. I guess I was so frightened, I didn’t know 
what I was saying. 

Zeke forced a laugh. “Hey, I like it down here!” he boasted. “I may just stay 
down here for a while. You know. Do some exploring.” He was trying to sound 
brave. But his voice came out tiny and trembling. 

He wasn’t fooling me. No way. 

“How could you bring us down here?” I cried. 

“You wanted to come, too!” he shot back. 

“I did not!” I screamed. “Ms. Walker told us this thing isn’t safe! And now 
we’ll be down here all night! Maybe forever!” 

“Unless we’re eaten by rats!” Zeke joked. 

“I’m sick of your stupid jokes!” I shouted. I totally lost it. I gave him a hard 
shove with both hands. He went sprawling off the platform. 

It was so dark, I couldn’t see him for a moment. 

“Ow!” I cried out as he shoved me back. 

Then I shoved him harder. 

Then he shoved me harder than that. 

I stumbled back—onto some kind of a switch. My back hit the switch. 

A loud clanking sound made me nearly jump out of my skin. 

“Brooke—jump back on! Quick!” Zeke screamed. 

I leaped back onto the platform just as it started to move. 

Up, up. Sliding slowly but steadily. 

The square of light above our heads grew larger and brighter as we rose 
back up to the auditorium. 

“Hey!” I cried out as the platform stopped with a jolt. 

“Way to go, Brookie!” Zeke yelled happily. He slapped me on the back. 

“Don’t celebrate yet,” I told him. We still weren’t back on the stage. The 
platform had stopped about five feet down from the top. Just where it had been 
for Ms. Walker. 

I guessed that the only way to raise it all the way up was to step on the peg 



onstage. 

“Give me a boost up,” Zeke urged eagerly. 

I cupped my hands together. He lowered his sneaker into my hands. 

“Wait!” he cried, stepping back down. “Whoa! What if the Phantom is up 
there waiting for us? Maybe you should go first!” 

“Ha-ha. Very funny,” I said, rolling my eyes. “Remind me to laugh later.” 
“Okay, okay. I’ll go first,” he muttered. 

He put his sneaker into my cupped hands, reached up to the stage floor, and 
I gave him a boost. 

I watched him scramble on to the stage. He disappeared from view. 

I waited for him to reach down for me. 

A whole minute went by. 

“Zeke?” The word came out tiny and weak. 

I waited some more. Listening hard. 

I couldn’t hear him up there. Where was he? 

“Zeke? Where are you?” I called up. “Come on. Raise the platform. Or give 
me a hand,” I called up. “I can’t make it by myself.” 

Another minute passed. It seemed like an hour. 

I suddenly realized what Zeke was trying to do. 

That big jerk! He was trying to scare me! 

“Hey! Enough!” I shouted. 

I had had more than enough of Zeke Matthews for one day. 

“Zeke!” I yelled. “Give me a break! Get me up!” 

Finally, his hands lowered down over the side. 

“It’s about time!” I shouted angrily. 

I grabbed both hands and let him pull me up to the stage. 

I shook my hair back. My eyes were slowly adjusting to the brighter light. 
“You know, you’re not funny!” I snapped. “Keeping me waiting down there was 
really—” 

I stopped and swallowed hard. It wasn’t Zeke who had pulled me from the 
trapdoor. 

A strange pair of dark, angry eyes stared into mine. 



8 


I swallowed hard. A strange little man stared back at me, an angry scowl on his 
face. He wore baggy gray pants and a loose-fitting gray sweatshirt, torn at the 
collar. 

His thick white hair fell wild and unbrushed over his forehead like a floor 
mop. He had a deep purple scar down the side of his face, nearly as long as the 
scar on Zeke’s creature mask. 

I could see that he was old. But he was tiny, no bigger than a kid. He stood 
only an inch or two taller than Zeke. 

As he squinted at me with his strange, gray eyes, his face twisted into an 
ugly frown. 

He looks like a phantom! The frightening thought flashed through my mind. 

“Wh-who are you?” I stammered. 

“I’m Emile. The night janitor,” the man rasped. 

“Where’s my friend Zeke?” I demanded in a shrill, frightened voice. 

“Brooke, I’m over here,” Zeke called out from behind me. 

I whirled around. Zeke stood on the other side of the trapdoor. He had his 
hands shoved deep into his jeans pockets. He was biting his lower lip. 

“Zeke!” I cried. “What’s going on? Why—” 

“The school is closed!” the janitor growled. He had a hoarse voice, like 
sandpaper. “What are you two doing in here?” 

Zeke and I exchanged glances. Zeke took a step forward. “We... uh... 
stayed for play rehearsal,” he told the man. 

“That’s right,” I chimed in. “We had a late rehearsal.” 

The janitor continued to squint suspiciously at me. “Play rehearsal?” he 
repeated. “Then where is everybody else?” 

I hesitated. This guy was scaring me so much, my legs wobbled. “We left,” 
I blurted out. “But we had to come back to get my jacket.” 

Behind Emile, I saw Zeke nodding, approving my lie. 

“How do you know about the trapdoor?” the janitor demanded in his 
sandpaper voice. 

I hesitated. It’s strange that I’ve never seen him in the school building 
before, I thought. 



“Ms. Walker, our teacher, showed it to us,” Zeke said softly. I could see that 
he was as scared as I was. 

The man leaned closer to me, squinting so that one side of his face was 
completely twisted up. “Don’t you know how dangerous it is?” he whispered. 

He leaned even closer, so close that I could feel his hot breath on my face. 
His pale gray eyes stared into mine. “Don’tyou know how dangerous it is?” 

Zeke and I talked on the phone that night. “That man wasn’t trying to warn us,” I 
told Zeke. “He was trying to scare us.” 

“Well, he didn’t scare me at all,” Zeke boasted. “I’m sorry if he got you 
upset, Brookie.” 

Oh, wow, I thought. Sometimes Zeke is such a phoney. 

“If you weren’t scared, how come you were shaking all the way home?” I 
demanded. 

“I wasn’t shaking. I was just exercising,” Zeke joked. “You know. Working 
out the calf muscles.” 

“Give me a break,” I moaned. “How come we’ve never seen that janitor 
before?” 

“Because he’s not a janitor. He is... the PHANTOM!” Zeke cried in a deep, 
scary voice. 

I didn’t laugh. “Get serious,” I told him. “It wasn’t a joke. He was really 
trying to frighten us.” 

“Hope you don’t have nightmares, Brookie,” Zeke replied, laughing. 

I hung up on him. 


* * * 


On Tuesday morning, I walked to school with my little brother, Jeremy. As we 
walked, I talked about the play. 

I told Jeremy the whole story. But I left out the part about the trapdoor. Ms. 
Walker said it would be better if we kept it a secret until the performance. 

“Is it really scary?” Jeremy asked me. Jeremy is seven, and he gets scared if 
you say “boo” to him. Once, I made him watch the movie Poltergeist with me, 
and he woke up screaming every night for three weeks. 

“Yeah, it’s pretty scary,” I told him. “But not scary like Friday the 13th 
scary.” 



Jeremy seemed relieved. He really hated scary things. On Halloween, he 
hid in his room! I would never make him watch Friday the 13th. He would 
probably have nightmares till he was fifty! 

“The play has a surprise,” I added. “And it’s a pretty awesome surprise.” 

“What is it?” Jeremy demanded. 

I reached over and messed up his hair. It’s chestnut-brown, like mine. “If I 
told you that,” I said, making a funny voice, “it wouldn’t be a surprise, would 
it?” ” 

“You sound just like Mom!” Jeremy cried. 

What an insult! 

I dropped him off at his school and then crossed the street to my school. As 
I made my way down the hall, I thought about my part in the play. Esmerelda 
had so many lines. I wondered if I could memorize them all in time. 

And I wondered if my old stage fright would come back. Last year, I had 
terrible stage fright in Guys and Dolls. And I didn’t even have any lines to say! 

I walked into the classroom, said good morning to some kids, made my way 
to my table—and stopped. 

“Hey!” A boy I had never seen before was at my place. 

He was kind of cute. He had dark brown hair and bright green eyes. He was 
wearing a big red-and-black flannel shirt over black sweatpants. 

He had made himself right at home. His books and notebooks were spread 
out. And he was tilting back in my chair with his black high-tops resting on the 
table. 

“You’re in my place,” I said, standing over him. 

He gazed up at me with those green eyes. “No, I’m not,” he replied 
casually. “This is my place.” 



9 


“Excuse me?” I said, staring down at him. 

He blushed. “I think this is where Ms. Walker told me to sit.” He glanced 
around nervously. 

I saw an empty spot at the table behind mine. “She probably meant over 
there,” I said, pointing. “I’ve been in this seat all year. Next to Zeke.” I motioned 
to Zeke’s chair. Zeke wasn’t there. He was late, as usual. 

The boy blushed even darker. “Sorry,” he muttered shyly. “I hate being the 
new kid.” He started to gather his books together. 

“This is your first day?” I asked. I introduced myself. 

“I’m Brian Colson,” he replied, climbing to his feet. “My family just moved 
to Woods Mill. From Indiana.” 

I said I’d never been to Indiana. It was a boring thing to say, but it was true. 

“You’re Brooke Rodgers?” he asked, studying me. “I heard you got the 
starring role. In the play.” 

“How did you hear that already?” I demanded. 

“Some kids were talking about it on the bus. You must be a good actress, 
huh?” he added shyly. 

“I guess. I don’t know. Sometimes I get pretty bad stage fright,” I told him. 

I don’t know why I told him all that. Sometimes I just rattle on. I guess 
that’s why my parents call me Babbling Brooke. 

Brian smiled shyly and sighed. “Back at my school in Indiana, I was in all 
the plays,” he told me. “But I never had the lead role. I wish I had moved here 
sooner. Then I could have tried out for The Phantom. ” 

I tried to picture Brian onstage in a play, but I couldn’t. He didn’t seem like 
the acting type to me. He seemed so shy. And he kept blushing all the time. 

But I decided to give the poor guy a break. “Brian, why don’t you come to 
rehearsal with me this afternoon?” I suggested. “Maybe you can get a small part 
or something.” 

Brian smiled as if I’d just offered him a million dollars. “You mean it?” he 
asked, wide-eyed. 

“Sure,” I replied. “No big deal.” 

Zeke came slinking into his seat, his eyes on Ms. Walker’s desk. “Am I 



late?” he whispered. 

I shook my head. Then I started to introduce him to Brian. But Ms. Walker 
stepped into the room and closed the door. Time for class to begin. 

Brian hurried to his place at the other table. I started to sit down, but 
realized I’d left my science notebook in my locker. 

“Be right back!” I called to Ms. Walker. I hurried out the door and jogged 
around the corner to my locker. 

“Hey!” To my surprise, the locker door stood half open. 

That’s weird, I thought. I remembered locking it. 

I pulled the door open the rest of the way. Started to reach inside for my 
notebook. 

And let out a startled gasp. 

Someone was in there—and he was staring right at me! 



10 


His ugly blue-and-green face grinned out at me. 

I gasped again and clamped my hand over my mouth. Then I cracked up 
laughing. 

Zeke and his dumb rubber creature mask. 

“Well, you got me this time, Zeke!” I murmured out loud. 

Then I saw the folded-up sheet of paper dangling beneath the mask. Some 
kind of note? 

I pulled it out and unfolded it. Scribbled in red crayon was a message: 

STAY AWAY FROM MY 
HOME SWEET HOME. 

“Ha-ha,” I murmured. “Very good, Zeke. Very amusing.” 

I pulled out my science notebook, slammed the locker shut, and locked it. 
Then I hurried back to the classroom. 

Ms. Walker stood behind her desk. She had just finished introducing Brian 
to everyone. Now she was reading the morning announcements. I slid into my 
seat beside Zeke. “You didn’t scare me one bit,” I lied. 

He looked up from his math notebook. Zeke always did his math homework 
first thing in class. “Huh?” He flashed me his innocent look. 

“Your mask,” I whispered. “It didn’t scare me.” 

“Mask? What mask?” he replied, tapping the pencil eraser against my arm. 

I shoved him away. “Stop acting stupid,” I said sharply. “Your note wasn’t 
funny, either. You can do better than that.” 

“I didn’t write you any note, Brooke,” Zeke replied impatiently. “I don’t 
know what you’re talking about. Really.” 

“For sure,” I said, rolling my eyes. “You don’t know anything about the 
mask in my locker or the note, right?” 

“Shut up and let me finish my math,” he said, staring down at his textbook. 
“You’re not making any sense.” 

“Oh. Well. I guess the real Phantom did it, then,” I said. 

He ignored me. He was scribbling equations in his notebook. 



What a phoney baloney! I thought. Zeke did it, and he knows it. 
For sure. 


* * * 


After school, I led Brian to the auditorium. I practically had to drag him up on 
the stage. He was so shy! 

“Ms. Walker, are there any parts still available?” I asked. “Brian is really 
interested in being in the play.” 

Ms. Walker glanced up from the script in her hands. I saw that she had 
scribbled notes all over the script. She studied Brian. 

“I’m really sorry, Brian,” she said, shaking her head. “You came to school a 
few days too late.” 

Brian blushed. I’ve never seen anyone blush so often. 

“There aren’t any speaking parts left,” Ms. Walker told him. “They’ve all 
been given out.” 

“Do you need a stand-in for anyone?” Brian asked. “I’m a very fast 
memorizer. I could memorize more than one part.” 

Wow, I thought. He really is eager to be in the play. 

“Well, we really don’t need any more stand-ins,” Ms. Walker told him. 
“But, I have an idea. You can join the scenery crew if you wish.” 

“Great!” Brian exclaimed with real enthusiasm. 

“Go see Tina over there,” Ms. Walker told him, pointing to the group of 
kids meeting at the back wall of the stage. Tina was busily pointing out where 
she wanted the scenery to go, motioning dramatically with both hands, making 
everyone follow her all around the stage. 

Brian seemed really happy. I watched him trot over to find Tina. 

I took a seat in the auditorium and concentrated on my script. I was in 
practically every scene. How could I possibly memorize my whole part? I sighed 
and slouched back in the seat, slinging my feet over the seat in front of me. 

I was memorizing my third line in the play, which went, “What proof do 
you have that this man might be dangerous ?”, when all the lights suddenly went 
out. 

A total blackout! I couldn’t see a thing. 

Kids started to shout. “Hey! Who turned out the lights?” 

“I can’t see!” 



“What’s happening? Turn them back on!” 

I sat straight up when I heard the shrill scream. 

A terrifying scream—like an animal howl—that ripped through the 
darkness and exploded over the auditorium. 

“No! Noooo!” I heard Corey Sklar moan. 

And then I heard someone else cry out, “It’s coming from up on the 
catwalk!” 

Another shrill wail rose up over the frightened cries of my friends. 

“Turn on the lights!” I heard Corey plead. “Please—turn on the lights!” 
Other frightened voices called out, “Who is screaming?” 

“Somebody—do something!” 

“There’s someone up on the catwalk!” 

The auditorium lights flickered back on. 

Another long howl from above the stage forced me to raise my eyes. 

And I saw him. A green-and-blue-masked creature wearing a shiny black 

cape. 

Gripping a long, heavy rope, he came swinging down from high on the 
catwalk. 

As he swung down to the stage, he threw his head back and laughed a 
horrifying evil laugh. 

I jumped to my feet and stared in amazement. 

The Phantom! 



11 


The Phantom landed hard on his feet. His shoes hit the stage floor with a thud. 

He let go of the rope and it flew away from him. 

The green-and-blue face glanced quickly around the stage. Tina and her 
scenery crew stood frozen against the wall, staring at him in horrified silence. 
Ms. Walker appeared stunned. She had her arms tightly crossed over her chest. 

The Phantom’s cape swirled around him as he stomped one shoe on the 
stage. 

He’s short, I realized, standing and staring from down in the second row of 
seats. He’s about Zeke’s height. Maybe an inch or two taller. 

Or maybe he’s exactly Zeke’s height—because he is Zeke! 

“Zeke! Hey—Zeke!” I called. 

The ugly, masked face peered out to the auditorium. The Phantom started to 
sink. His feet disappeared. The legs of his dark pants. Down. Down. 

He had stepped on the peg and was riding the trapdoor down. 

“Zeke!” I yelled. I ran up the aisle and pulled myself up onto the stage. 
“Zeke—you’re not funny!” I shouted. 

But the Phantom had vanished below the stage. 

I ran up to the opening in the stage and stared down into the darkness. Ms. 
Walker stepped up beside me, an angry scowl on her face. “Was that Zeke?” she 
asked me. “Was that really Zeke?” 

“I—I’m not sure,” I stammered. “I think so.” 

“Zeke!” Ms. Walker called down into the opening. “Zeke—are you down 
there?” 

No reply. 

The platform had lowered all the way down. I couldn’t see anything but a 
deep well of blackness. 

Kids gathered around the opening, chattering excitedly, laughing and 
teasing each other. “Was that Zeke?” I heard Corey ask. “Was Zeke wearing that 
dumb mask again?” 

“Is Zeke going to ruin our rehearsal today?” Ms. Walker demanded angrily. 
“Does he think we need to be scared every afternoon?” 

I shrugged. I couldn’t answer. 



“Maybe it wasn’t Zeke,” I heard Corey say. He sounded very frightened. 

“It had to be Zeke. Zeke—are you here?” Ms. Walker shouted, cupping her 
hands around her mouth. She turned slowly, her eyes darting over the stage and 
then all the seats of the auditorium. “Zeke Matthews? Can you hear me?” 

No answer. No sign of Zeke. 

“He’s your friend, Brooke,” Tina said nastily. “Don’t you know where he 
is? Can’t you tell him to stop ruining our play?” 

I sputtered an answer. I was so angry, I didn’t know what I was saying. 

I mean, Zeke is my friend. But I’m not responsible for him! 

Tina was just trying to make me look bad and score some points with Ms. 
Walker. 

“Okay, scenery people,” Ms. Walker instructed. “Back to work. I’ll take 
care of this. The rest of you—” 

She stopped. We all heard it. The loud clanking sound. 

A loud hum rose up over the clanking. 

“The trapdoor—it’s coming back up!” I cried, pointing. 

“Good,” Ms. Walker said, crossing her arms over her chest again. She 
narrowed her eyes at the opening in the stage floor. “Now I will let Zeke know 
how we feel about his little joke. His last little joke, if I have anything to say 
about it!” 

Uh-oh, I thought. Poor Zeke. 

Ms. Walker was a really good teacher, and a really nice person, too—until 
you got on her bad side. But once you did that, once you made her angry, once 
you had her crossing her arms and squinting her eyes at you—then you were in 
major trouble. 

Because she could be really mean. 

I knew that Zeke was just having some fun. He loved being the center of 
attention. And he loved to scare people. He especially loved to scare me. 

This was a game for him, I knew. He was trying to show everyone that they 
were scaredy-cat wimps, and he wasn’t. 

Zeke played this game all the time. 

But this time it had backfired. This time he had gone too far. 

And Ms. Walker was waiting for him, arms crossed, eyes squinting. 

Will she toss him out of the play? I wondered. Or will she just yell at him 
until his ears curl? 

The hum grew louder. The stage floor vibrated. 



We all heard the platform stop—its usual five feet below the stage. 

Poor Zeke, I thought. He’s standing there innocently. He doesn’t know what 
’s in for. 

Poor Zeke. 

I peered down into the opening—and gasped. 



12 


The platform was empty. No one there. 

Zeke—or whoever it was—had sent it back up empty. And had disappeared 
into the dark tunnels far below the school. 

Zeke wouldn’t do that, I told myself. Even Zeke wouldn’t be crazy enough 
to go down in that darkness by himself. Without a flashlight. Without a clue as to 
what was down there. 

Would he? 

Yes, he would. I answered my own question. If he thought he could really 
terrify us, Zeke would do anything! 

Ms. Walker canceled the rehearsal. She told the scenery crew to stay and 
paint the backdrop. She told the rest of us to go home and study our parts. 

“I’m going to have a long talk with Zeke when I find him,” she muttered. 
Then she turned and made her way quickly out of the auditorium. 

I took my time walking home. I thought about Zeke all the way. I was 
thinking so hard, I walked right past my house! 

Down the block, I saw Zeke’s mother’s red Pontiac pull up their driveway. 
Shielding my eyes against the late afternoon sun, I saw Mrs. Matthews climb out 
of the car. And then I saw Zeke on the other side. 

“Hey! Zeke!” I shouted as I went running across the lawns toward him. 
“Zeke!” 

His mother waved to me and disappeared into the house. Zeke looked 
surprised to see me. “Is play rehearsal over so early?” he asked. 

“Yes. Thanks to you,” I muttered. 

“Huh?” He gave me his innocent look again. “What did / do?” 

“You didn’t scare me, Zeke,” I told him. “No one thought it was funny. And 
now you’re in a load of trouble with Ms. Walker.” 

He narrowed his eyes and scrunched up his face, pretending not to 
understand. “What are you talking about, Brooke? How can I be in trouble? I 
wasn’t even there!” 

“You were there long enough,” I told him. 

He shook his head. His freckles seemed to grow darker. His blond hair 
fluttered in the wind. “No, I wasn’t,” he said quietly. “I told Ms. Walker I 



wouldn’t be there. I told her this morning that I had to miss rehearsal.” 

“So you could get into your mask and cape and come flying down from the 
catwalk?” I demanded suspiciously. 

“No. I told her I had a dentist appointment.” 

I gaped at him in shock. My mouth dropped open. 

“What’s your problem, Brooke?” he demanded. “It was only a checkup.” 

“You—you really weren’t at school?” I stammered. 

He shook his head. “No way.” 

“Then who was the Phantom?” I asked in a tiny voice. 

A strange smile spread over Zeke’s face. 

“It was you!” I cried angrily. “You did your Phantom act, and then you went 
to your dentist appointment! Didn’t you, Zeke! Didn’t you!” 

He only laughed. He wouldn’t answer. 

After school the next afternoon, I walked with Brian to the auditorium. He 
looked cute in a black vest over a plain white T-shirt and faded jeans. “How are 
you doing with Tina?” I asked. 

“Okay, I guess,” Brian replied. “She’s a little bossy. But she’s letting me 
design the backdrop pretty much on my own.” 

I waved to some kids who were heading out the door for home. We turned 
the corner. I saw Corey and Tina walking into the auditorium. 

“Did Zeke work things out with Ms. Walker?” 

Brian asked. “I saw him talking to her this morning.” 

“I guess,” I replied. “She’s letting Zeke stay in the play—for now.” 

“Do you think it was Zeke who pulled that stunt yesterday?” Brian asked. 

I nodded. “Yes, I do. Zeke likes scaring people. He’s been doing it since we 
were little. I think Zeke is trying to scare us. He’s trying to make us think there’s 
a real Phantom in the school.” I smiled at Brian. “But I don’t scare so easy!” I 
declared. 

Soon after rehearsal started, Ms. Walker called Zeke and me onstage. She said 
she wanted to walk us through one of our scenes together. She wanted to show 
us where we should stand when we said our lines. She called it “blocking”. 

She also asked Tina Powell and Robert Hernandez, Zeke’s understudy, to 
come up onstage. Ms. Walker said they should know all the blocking, too. Just in 


case. 



Just in case? I thought. Then I remembered Tina’s warning: “In case you 
get sick or something on the night of the play, I get to play your part. ” 

Well, Tina, I hate to disappoint you, I muttered to myself, but I plan to be 
perfectly fine. So have fun painting your scenery. It’s the only time you’ll be 
onstage. 

I know, I know. That’s kind of mean. But Tina deserved it. 

Ms. Walker showed Zeke where to stand. I stood off to the side of the stage 
with Tina, waiting for my cue to go on. 

“I guess Ms. Walker and Zeke worked things out,” Tina said. “I heard him 
this morning telling her he was at the dentist’s, and so he couldn’t be the one to 
swing down from the ceiling.” 

I started to tell Tina to be quiet so I could hear my cue. But I was too late. I 
already heard Ms. Walker calling my name. 

“Brooke Rodgers!” She sounded angry. “What’s going on over there? 
You’re supposed to be onstage!” 

“Thanks a bunch, Tina,” I muttered under my breath. I ran out onto the 
stage. Glancing back, I could see Tina laughing to herself. 

I couldn’t believe it! Tina had made me miss my cue on purpose! 

Onstage, I didn’t know where I was supposed to stand. I didn’t even know 
what page of the script we were on. 

What was my next line? 

I couldn’t remember. 

In a panic, I stared out at the kids in the auditorium seats. They all stared 
back at me, waiting for me to speak. 

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. 

“The line is, ‘Is somebody down here?’\” Tina yelled loudly from offstage. 

Oh, wow, I thought unhappily. Tina will do anything to show me up! She’s 
just hoping Ms. Walker will kick me out of the play. 

I felt so angry, my head was spinning. I couldn’t think straight. I repeated 
the line, then took a deep breath to calm down. 

Zeke had the next line. He was supposed to appear onstage and scare 
Esmerelda. 

But Zeke wasn’t onstage. He wasn’t anywhere in sight! 

I peered out into the auditorium. Ms. Walker stood at the foot of the stage. 
She had her hands on her waist. She tapped one toe impatiently on the hard floor. 

The auditorium grew silent, except for that tap. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Ms. 



Walker seemed to be very annoyed. 

“Where is Zeke?” she asked wearily. “What is he doing now? Is he going to 
come flying down from the catwalk in full costume or something?” 

I should have guessed what Zeke was up to. But it didn’t dawn on me until I 
heard a familiar noise. The loud clanking. Followed by the hum. 

The trapdoor platform! It was rising! 

I sighed. “Here comes Zeke,” I told Ms. Walker. 

And a second later, Zeke’s blue-and-green masked head appeared. 

I stepped back and watched him rise from down below. It looked awesome. 
Really dramatic. 

Slowly, he appeared, rising up over the stage floor. 

He reached the top and just stood there for a long moment, staring out at the 
auditorium, as if posing for a picture. He was in full costume: his mask, a black 
cape down to his ankles, black shirt and pants. 

What a ham! I thought. He really loves having everyone stare at him and 
think he’s hot stuff! 

And then he stepped toward me, taking quick strides. Through the mask, he 
raised his eyes to me. 

I tried to remember what I was supposed to say next. 

But before I could utter a sound, he grabbed both of my shoulders. He 
shook them really hard. Too hard. 

Ease up, Zeke, I thought. It’s only a rehearsal. 

“Go away! ” he cried in a furious whisper. 

I remembered what I was supposed to say. I opened my mouth to speak... 

But then I froze. 

I saw someone waving to me from the edge of the stage. 

Waving frantically. 

It was Zeke! 



13 


I knew I was in major trouble. 

If Zeke was standing way over there, who was shaking my shoulders, 
grinning at me through the ugly mask? 

“Help! Somebody—help me!” I screamed, struggling to free myself. 

“No, Brooke!” Ms. Walker called out to me. “The line is, ‘Help. Help me, 
Father. ’ ” 

She didn’t get it. 

Couldn’t she see that there was a real phantom up here trying to shake me 
to death? 

Suddenly, the Phantom lowered his masked face and whispered harshly in 
my ear, “Stay away. Stay away from my home sweet home!” 

I gazed into his eyes. 

They looked familiar to me. 

Who was he? I knew I’d seen him before. 

But before I could remember, he spun away from me, took a diving leap off 
the stage, and ran up the long aisle, his cape flowing behind him. 

I stood watching in horror as he disappeared out through the auditorium 
doors. 

Some kids laughed. I heard Tina mutter to someone, “Was that in the 
script?” 

Zeke came running over to me. “Brookie, are you all right?” 

“I—I don’t know,” I replied. I felt really shaken up. 

“That was weirdl” Zeke exclaimed. 

Ms. Walker came striding across the stage, swinging her clipboard in one 
hand. She had a very confused expression on her face. “Can anyone explain 
what just happened here?” she asked. 

“There’s a real phantom in this school,” Zeke said softly. He narrowed his eyes 
at me thoughtfully. 

We were sitting in the front row of the auditorium. Brian scraped at a 
smudge of black paint on the back of his hand. I sat between the two boys, 
studying Zeke. 



The lights had been dimmed. Rehearsal had ended a few minutes before. I 
could hear a few voices out in the hall. The door had just closed behind Ms. 
Walker. 

“Why are you staring at me like that?” Zeke demanded. 

“I’m still wondering if you aren’t responsible for everything ,” I told him 
bluntly. 

He rolled his eyes. “Yeah. Sure,” he muttered. “How could I be in two 
places at once today, Brooke? Answer me that. That’s pretty tricky, even for 
someone as brilliant and clever as me! ” 

I laughed. “It’s possible,” I replied. 

“I can’t get this paint off,” Brian moaned. “Look. I got it on my shirt, too.” 

“Is it washable paint?” Zeke asked. 

“How should I know?” Brian replied unhappily. “I didn’t read the label on 
the can. Do you read labels on cans?” 

“Zeke only reads cereal boxes,” I joked. 

“Will you stop kidding around?” Zeke demanded impatiently. “We’ve got a 
real phantom in this school. And for some reason, he’s trying to mess up our 
play.” 

I was still studying Zeke’s face, trying to figure out if he was telling the 
truth. “I saw you talking to Andy Seltzer this morning before school,” I told 
Zeke. “You could have planned this whole phantom thing with him. You gave 
Andy the costume, right? You told him what to do. You and Andy planned out 
the whole thing. Right?” 

Zeke’s mouth dropped open. “Huh? Why would I do that?” 

“To scare me,” I replied. “To scare everyone. To make us think there’s a 
real phantom. And then when you get us really scared, you laugh and say 
‘gotcha!’ And we all feel like total jerks.” 

A smile crossed Zeke’s face. “Wish I’d thought of that,” he murmured. “But 
I’m serious, Brooke. I know you don’t believe me, but I didn’t plan anything 
with Andy. And I didn’t—” 

Tina hopped down from the stage. I guessed she’d been working on scenery 
behind the curtain. “Are you feeling better, Brooke?” she asked coldly. 

I turned to her. “Feeling better? I’m okay. What do you mean?” 

“You looked so stressed out onstage, I thought maybe you were sick,” Tina 
replied nastily. “Are you coming down with the flu? I hear there’s a really bad 
one going around.” 



“I’m fine,” I replied curdy. 

“Is this paint washable?” Brian asked Tina. 

Tina shrugged. “Beats me. Try turpentine.” She smiled at Brian. “You’re 
doing a good job on the backdrop.” Then she turned back to me and her smile 
faded. “At least someone is doing a good job on this play.” 

Before I could reply, she turned and hurried across the aisle and out the 
auditorium door. 

“She’s praying I get the flu,” I told Zeke. “Isn’t that sick?” 

He didn’t reply. He was thinking so hard about the Phantom, I don’t think 
he even heard me. 

“Do you think Tina could be doing all these terrible things?” I asked. “Just 
to frighten me away so she can be Esmerelda?” 

“That’s crazy,” Zeke replied softly. 

“Yeah. I guess,” I agreed. 

Brian just kept trying to peel the black paint off his hand. 

“Let’s go home,” I suggested. “It’s really late. Maybe we can talk about the 
Phantom later.” I climbed to my feet. 

Zeke glared up at me. “You still don’t believe me—do you?” he accused. 
“You still think this is all some plot just to scare you.” 

“Maybe. Maybe not,” I replied, climbing over him to get to the aisle. I 
really didn’t know what to think. 

Brian got up and followed me toward the door. I turned back to Zeke, who 
was still in his seat. “Are you coming? Are you going to walk with us?” 

Zeke stood up without replying. “Yeah. I guess.” 

We were heading down the hall to our lockers when Zeke suddenly stopped. 
“Oh. I forgot,” he uttered. 

“Forgot what?” I asked. It was nearly dinnertime. I was eager to get home. 
My mom was probably wondering if I’d been mn over by a bus or something. 
Mom always imagines me run over by a bus. I don’t really know why. I never 
knew anyone who was ever run over by a bus! 

“My math book,” Zeke said. “I have to go to the office. I left it in the 
auditorium the other night. I’ve got to see if anyone turned it in.” 

“I’ll see you later,” Brian said, backing down the hall. 

“Where do you live?” I called to him. 

He pointed in a direction. South, I think. “See you tomorrow!” He turned 
and jogged around the corner. 



I followed Zeke to Mr. Levy’s office. All the lights were on, but the office 
was empty, except for Dot, the secretary. She was shutting down her computer, 
getting ready to go home. 

“Did anyone turn in my math book?” Zeke asked her, leaning on the 
counter. 

“Math book?” She squinted back at Zeke thoughtfully. 

“I left it in the auditorium the other night,” Zeke said. “I thought maybe that 
guy Emile turned it in.” 

Dot’s expression turned to confusion. “Who? Who is Emile?” 

“You know,” Zeke replied. “The little old guy with the white hair. The night 
janitor.” 

Dot shook her head. “You’re a little mixed up, Zeke,” she said. “There’s no 
one named Emile who works at the school. We don’t have a night janitor.”

Tina Powell called me at home that night. “Just wanted to see how you’re 
feeling,” she said. “You looked so pale, Brooke.” 

“I’m not getting the flu!” I shouted. I really lost my cool. But I couldn’t 
help it. 

“I heard you sneezing a lot yesterday,” Tina said, pretending to be 
concerned. 

“I always sneeze a lot,” I replied. “Bye, Tina.” 

“Who was that other phantom who jumped onstage this afternoon?” Tina 
asked before I could hang up. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “I really—” 

“That was kind of scary,” Tina interrupted. “I hope you weren’t too scared 
or anything, Brooke.” 

“See you tomorrow, Tina,” I said coldly. 

I hung up the phone before she could say anything else. Tina was really 
becoming a pain, I decided. 

How much does she want to play Esmerelda? I found myself wondering. 

Just how much does she want the part? Enough to try to scare me away? 

Zeke called later and convinced me that Emile had to be our phantom. “He lied 
to us, right?” Zeke asked excitedly. “He told us he worked for the school. And he 
tried to frighten us. It’s got to be him,” Zeke insisted. 

“Yeah. Probably,” I replied, twirling the hair scrunchie on my wrist. 

“He’s the right size,” Zeke continued. “And he knew about the trapdoor.” 
Zeke took a breath. “And why was he there, Brookie? Why was he there in the 
auditorium at night?” 

“Because he’s the Phantom?” I asked. 

It made sense. 

I agreed to get to school early so that Zeke and I could tell Ms. Walker 
about Emile. 

That night I dreamed about the play. I was onstage in my costume. The 
spotlights were all on me. I stared out at the seats, filled with people. 

The auditorium grew silent. Everyone was waiting for Esmerelda to speak. 



I opened my mouth—and realized I didn’t remember what I was supposed 
to say. 

I stared out at the faces of the audience. 

I had forgotten everything. Every word. Every line. 

The words had all flown away, like birds leaving a nest. 

My nest was empty. My mind was a total blank. 

I stood there in panic. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak. 

I woke up in a cold sweat. My entire body trembled. My muscles had all 
knotted up. I had kicked all the covers onto the floor. 

What a horrible dream. 

I couldn’t wait to get dressed and get to school. I wanted to forget about 
that awful nightmare as quickly as I could. 

I had to walk Jeremy to school. So I didn’t get there as early as I wanted. 

Jeremy kept asking me about the play. He wanted to hear more about the 
Phantom. But I really didn’t feel like talking about it. I kept remembering my 
dream, remembering the panic of standing in front of three hundred people and 
looking like a total jerk. 

I dropped Jeremy off, then hurried across the street. I found Zeke waiting 
for me by the front door. He was staring impatiently at his watch. 

I don’t know why. It doesn’t have the correct time on it. It’s one of those 
digital watches with seventeen different controls on it. Zeke can’t figure out how 
to set it. He can play games on it—and play a dozen different songs. But he can’t 
get it to tell the time. 

“Sorry I’m late,” I said. 

He grabbed my arm and pulled me right into the classroom. He wouldn’t 
even let me get my books from my locker or take off my coat. 

We marched up to Ms. Walker, who was sitting behind her desk, glancing 
over the morning announcements. She smiled at us, but her smile faded as she 
saw the solemn looks on our faces. 

“Is something wrong?” Ms. Walker asked. 

“Could we speak to you?” Zeke whispered, glancing at the kids already in 
class. “In private?” 

Ms. Walker gazed up at the wall clock. “Can’t it wait? The bell is going to 
ring in two minutes.” 

“It will only take a minute,” Zeke promised. 

She followed us out into the hall and leaned her back against the tile wall. 



“What’s the problem?” 

“There’s a phantom in the school,” Zeke told her breathlessly. “A real one. 
Brooke and I have seen him.” 

“Whoa!” Ms. Walker murmured, raising both hands to say stop. 

“No! Really!” I insisted. “We did see him, Ms. Walker. In the auditorium. 
We sneaked in. To use the trapdoor, and—” 

“You did what?” she cried, narrowing her eyes first at me, then at Zeke. 

“I know, I know,” Zeke said, blushing. “We weren’t supposed to. But that’s 
not the point.” 

“There’s a phantom,” I said. “And he’s trying to stop the play.” 

“I know you think I’ve been doing all those things,” Zeke added. “But I 
haven’t. It’s the Phantom. He—” 

Ms. Walker raised her hands again. She started to say something, but the 
bell rang—right over our heads. 

We raised our hands to protect our ears. 

When the bell finally stopped clanging, Ms. Walker took a few steps toward 
the classroom door. It was really noisy inside. The kids were all taking 
advantage of her not being in there. 

“I’m sorry I upset you with that story,” she told us. 

“Huh?” Zeke and I both cried out. 

“I never should have told that old phantom story,” Ms. Walker said fretfully. 
“It got a lot of kids upset. I apologize for scaring you.” 

“But you didn’t!” Zeke protested. “We saw a guy, and—” 

“Have you been having nightmares about a phantom?” Ms. Walker 
demanded. 

She didn’t believe us. She didn’t believe a word we had said. 

“Listen—” I started. 

All three of us jumped when we heard a loud crash inside the room. A crash 
followed by wild laughter. 

“Let’s get inside,” Ms. Walker said. She pointed at Zeke. “No more 
practical jokes—okay? No more jokes. We want the play to be good, don’t we?” 
Before we could answer, she turned and hurried into the room. 

“What am I doing here?” Brian moaned. He shivered and stared up at the dark 
trees. “Why am I doing this?” 

“You came with us because you’re a nice guy,” I told him, patting the 



shoulder of his sweater. 

“No. Because I’m an idiot!” Brian corrected me. 

This was all Zeke’s idea. He came to my house after dinner. I told my 
parents we had our play rehearsal. A lie. 

Then Zeke and I walked to school. We met Brian on the front walk, where 
he’d promised to wait for us. 

“I can’t believe Ms. Walker didn’t believe us,” Zeke fretted. 

“Would you believe such a nutty story?” I demanded. 

“Well, we’re going to find the Phantom and prove we’re right,” Zeke said 
firmly. “We have no choice now. I mean, if Ms. Walker won’t help us, we’ll have 
to find him on our own.” 

“You just like a good adventure,” I teased him. 

He raised his eyes to mine. “Well, Brookie, if you’re too scared...” 

“But what am / doing here?” Brian repeated, staring at the dark school 
building. 

“We need all the help we can get!” I told him. 

I gave Zeke a shove. “Let’s go. I’ll show you who’s scared and who isn’t.” 

“I think I’m a little scared,” Brian admitted. “What if we get caught?” 

“Who’s going to catch us?” Zeke asked him. “You heard what Dot said in 
the office. There’s no night janitor.” 

“But what if there’s an alarm or something?” Brian demanded. “You know. 
A burglar alarm.” 

“For sure,” I replied, rolling my eyes. “Our school can’t even afford pencil 
sharpeners! No way they’ve got burglar alarms.” 

“Well, we’re going to have to break in,” Zeke said quietly, his eyes on the 
street. A station wagon rolled by without slowing. He tugged at the front doors 
again. “They’re locked tight.” 

“Maybe a side door?” Brian suggested. 

We crept around to the side of the building. The playground stretched out, 
silent and empty. The grass glowed all silvery under the bright half-moon. 

The side doors were locked, too. 

And the back door that led into the band room was also locked. 

I raised my eyes to the roof. The building hovered over us like some kind of 
dark creature. The windows reflected the white moonlight. It was the only light I 
could see. 

“Hey—that window is open!” Zeke whispered. 



We ran full speed up to the half-open window in a ground-floor classroom. 
It was the home ec room, I saw. Mrs. Lamston probably left the window open to 
let out the horrible smell of the muffins we baked that afternoon. 

Zeke raised both hands to the window ledge and hoisted himself up. Sitting 
on the ledge, he pushed the window open wider. 

A few seconds later, Brian and I followed him into the home ec room. The 
aroma of burned cranberry muffins lingered in the air. We tiptoed through the 
darkness to the door. 

“Ouch!” I cried out as I banged my thigh into a low table. 

“Be quiet!” Zeke scolded. 

“Hey—I didn’t do it on purpose!” I whispered back angrily. 

He was already out the door. Brian and I followed, moving slowly, 
carefully. 

The hall was even darker than the classroom. We kept pressed against the 
wall as we made our way toward the auditorium. 

My heart was racing. I felt all tingly. My shoes scraped loudly over the hard 
floor. 

Nothing to be afraid of, I told myself. It’s just the school building, the 
building you’ve been in a million times. And there’s no one else here. 

Just you. Zeke. Brian. And a phantom. 

A phantom who doesn’t want to be found. 

“I don’t think I like this,” Brian whispered as we edged our way around a 
corner. “I’m really pretty scared.” 

“Just pretend you’re in a scary movie,” I told him. “Pretend it’s just a 
movie.” 

“But I don’t like scary movies!” he protested. 

“Ssshhh,” Zeke warned. He stopped suddenly. I bumped right into him. 
“Try not to be a klutz, Brookie,” he whispered. 

“Try not to be a jerk, Zekey,” I replied nastily. 

I squinted into the darkness. We had reached the auditorium. 

Zeke pulled open the nearest door. We peered inside. Total blackness. The 
air in the auditorium felt cooler. 

Cool and damp. 

That’s because a ghost lives in here, I thought. 

That made my heart pump even harder. I wished I could control my 
thoughts a little better. 



Zeke fumbled with his hand against the wall and clicked on a row of lights 
over the section of seats to our left. The stage came into view. Empty and silent. 
Someone had left a ladder leaning against one wall. Several paint cans were 
lined up beside the ladder. 

“How about turning on ah the lights?” Brian suggested. He sounded really 
frightened. 

“No way,” Zeke replied, his eyes on the stage. “We want to take the 
Phantom by surprise, don’t we? We don’t want to warn him that we’re coming.” 

Huddled close together, we made our way slowly down the center aisle 
toward the stage. In the dim light, long shadows fell over the seats. 

Ghostly shadows, I thought. 

Did a shadow move near the stage? 

No. 

Stop it, Brooke, I scolded myself. Don’t let your imagination go wild. Not 
tonight. 

I kept moving my eyes back and forth, checking out the stage and the rows 
of seats as we slowly made our way to the front. 

Where is he? I wondered. Where is the Phantom? 

Does he live in that dark chamber so far below the stage? 

We were just a few feet from the stage when we heard the sound. 

A footstep? A floorboard creaking? 

All three of us stopped. A11 three of us heard it. 

I grabbed Zeke’s arm. I saw Brian’s green eyes go wide with fright. 

And then we heard another sound. A cough. 

“We’re... n-not alone!” I stammered. 



15 


“Wh-who’s there?” I called. But my voice caught in my throat. 

“Is anybody up there?” Zeke called to the stage. 

No reply. 

Another footstep. 

Brian took a step back. He grabbed the back of a seat and held on. 

“He’s back there,” Zeke said, leaning close to me, his eyes excited. “I know 
he’s back there.” 

“Where?” I demanded, choking out the word. It was hard to talk with my 
heart in my throat. 

I stared up at the stage. I couldn’t see anyone. 

I jumped when I heard another cough. 

And then a clanking sound rose up over the stage and echoed through the 
auditorium. 

At first I thought the trapdoor was about to move. 

Was someone riding up on it? Was the Phantom about to rise in front of our 
eyes? 

No. 

I cried out when I saw the backdrop begin to unfurl. 

The clanking sound grew louder. The backdrop was slowly being lowered 
at the back of the stage. 

“Who is doing it?” I whispered. “Who on earth is sending it down?” 

Zeke and Brian stared straight ahead and didn’t reply. 

Zeke’s mouth was wide open. His eyes didn’t blink. 

Brian gripped the back of the chair with both hands. 

The painted backdrop clanked down, unrolling as it lowered. 

All three of us gasped as we saw what had been done to it. 

It had been a gray brick theater wall. Brian and several other kids had 
worked for days on it, sketching it out, then painting it brick by brick. 

“Who—who did that to my painting?” Brian cried out. 

Zeke and I remained staring at it in silent horror. 

The gray wall had been covered with red paint splotches and thick, red 



smears. 

It looked as if someone had dipped a wide brush in red paint, then smeared 
and stabbed it all over the backdrop. 

“It’s mined!” Brian declared shrilly. 

Zeke was the first to move. He raised his hands to the stage floor and pulled 
himself up onto the stage. Brian and I followed after him. 

“Who’s here?” Zeke called out, cupping his hands around his mouth. 
“Who’s in here?” 

Silence. 

Someone is here, I knew. Someone had to lower that backdrop so that we 
could see what had been done to it. 

“Who’s here? Where are you?” Zeke repeated. 

Again, no reply. 

We moved closer, making our way slowly, keeping close together. 

And as we stepped up to it, words came into view. They were scrawled 
across the bottom, thick letters in heavy red paint. 

I stopped and squinted to read the message in the dim light: 

STAY AWAY FROM MY 
HOME SWEET HOME. 

“Whoa,” I murmured. I felt a chill roll down my back. 

Then I heard a side door being pulled open. 

All three of us turned away from the backdrop in time to see a figure step 
into the auditorium. 

We cried out in surprise when we saw who it was.

She stood gaping up at us. She blinked her eyes several times, as if she didn’t 
believe what she was seeing. 

“I—I am really shocked,” Ms. Walker said finally. 

I swallowed hard. I stmggled to say something, but no sound would come 
out. 

Zeke and Brian stood frozen like me. 

“I am so disappointed in all three of you,” Ms. Walker said, stepping closer. 
“Breaking and entering is a serious crime. And the three of you have no business 

She stopped short and let out a little gurgle as her eyes fell on the backdrop. 
She had been so surprised to find Zeke, Brian, and me onstage, she hadn’t seen it 
—until now. 

“Oh, no! Oh good heavens!” she cried, raising both hands to her face. She 
tilted. Sort of toppled from side to side. I thought she was about to fall over! 

“How could you?” she gasped. She hurried across the stage, her eyes on the 
paint-splotched backdrop. “How could you ruin it? All the students worked for 
so many days to get it right. How could you ruin it for everyone?” 

“We didn’t,” Zeke said quietly. 

“We didn’t do it,” I repeated. 

She shook her head hard, as if trying to shake us away. “I’m afraid I’ve 
caught you red-handed,” she said quietly, almost sadly. I saw tears brim in her 
eyes. 

“Ms. Walker, really—” I started. 

She raised a hand to stop me. “Was it so important to you three to have your 
little joke?” she asked, her voice trembling. 

“Ms. Walker—” 

“Was it so important to make everyone believe there is a phantom? So 
important that you broke into the school—committed a serious crime—and then 
completely destroyed the scenery for our play? Was your joke so important?” 

“We really didn’t do it,” I insisted, my voice trembling, too. 

Ms. Walker stepped forward and rubbed a finger over a red paint splotch on 
the backdrop. When she pulled the finger away, it was smeared with red paint. 



“The paint is still wet,” she said, her eyes burning accusingly into mine. 
“There’s no one else here. Are you going to keep lying to me all night?” 

“If you’d just give us a chance—” Zeke started. 

“I’m especially disappointed in you, Brian,” Ms. Walker said, shaking her 
head, a frown tightening her features. “You just started at this school a week or 
so ago. You should be on your best behavior.” 

Brian blushed redder than I’ve ever seen a human blush. He lowered his 
eyes, as if he were guilty. 

I took a deep breath. “Ms. Walker, you have to let us explain!” I cried 
shrilly. “We really didn’t do this! We found it like this! Really!” 

Ms. Walker opened her mouth to speak, but changed her mind. “Okay.” She 
crossed her arms over her skinny chest. “Go ahead. But I want the truth. ” 

“The truth,” I said. I raised my right hand, as if swearing an oath. “Brian, 
Zeke and I did sneak into the school. We didn’t really break in. We climbed in 
through a window.” 

“Why?” Ms. Walker demanded sternly. “What are you doing here? Why 
aren’t you home where you should be?” 

“We came to look for the Phantom,” Zeke broke in. He swept his blond hair 
back with one hand. He always did that to his hair when he was really tense. 

“We told you about the Phantom this morning, but you didn’t believe us.” 

“Of course I didn’t believe you!” Ms. Walker declared. “It’s an old legend. 
Just a story.” She frowned at Zeke. 

Zeke let out a frustrated sigh. “We saw the Phantom, Ms. Walker. Brooke 
and I. We saw him. He’s the one who painted all over the backdrop. Not us. He’s 
the one who swung down from the catwalk. And grabbed Brooke at rehearsal.” 

“Why should I believe that?” Ms. Walker demanded, her arms still tightly 
crossed in front her. 

“Because it’s true,” I said. “Zeke, Brian, and I—we came to the auditorium 
to look for the Phantom.” 

“Where were you going to look for him?” Ms. Walker asked. 

“Well,” Zeke stammered. “Probably underneath the stage.” 

“You were going to take the trapdoor down?” Ms. Walker asked. 

I nodded. “Maybe. If we had to.” 

“But I clearly instructed everyone to stay away from the trapdoor,” she said. 

“I know,” I told her. “And I’m sorry. We’re all sorry. But we are really 
desperate to find the Phantom, to prove to you that he is real, that we’re not 



making him up.” 

Her expression remained hard. She continued to glare at us. “I haven’t 
heard anything to convince me,” she said. 

“When we got here, we heard some noises,” Zeke told her, shifting 
uncomfortably from foot to foot. “Footsteps. Floorboards creaking. So we knew 
someone else was here.” 

“And then the backdrop started to come down,” Brian broke in, his voice 
shaky and small. “We just stood here and watched it, Ms. Walker. That’s the 
truth. And then when we saw how it was messed up, we... we couldn’t believe 
it!” 

Ms. Walker’s expression softened a little. Brian sounded so upset, I think 
she was starting to believe him. 

“I worked so hard on that backdrop,” Brian continued. “It was the first 
thing I ever worked on at this school, and I wanted it to be good. I wouldn’t 
wreck my own backdrop for a dumb joke. I really wouldn’t.” 

Ms. Walker uncrossed her arms. She glanced at each of us, then returned 
her eyes to the backdrop. Her lips silently formed the words of the scrawled 
message: 


STAY AWAY FROM MY 
HOME SWEET HOME. 

She shut her eyes and kept them shut for a long moment. Then she turned 
back to us. “I want to believe you,” she confessed with a sigh. “But I just don’t 
know.” 

She began to pace back and forth in front of us. “I drove back to school 
because I’d forgotten your math test papers. I heard voices in the auditorium. I 
come in here, and I find you on the stage. The scenery totally smeared and 
destroyed. The paint still wet. And you ask me to believe that a mysterious 
phantom from over seventy years ago is responsible.” 

I didn’t say a word. Neither did Zeke or Brian. I don’t think we had 
anything more to say. 

“The weird thing is, I’m starting to believe you,” Ms. Walker said, 
frowning. 

The three of us let out relieved sighs. 

“At least, I’m starting to believe that you didn’t paint on the backdrop.” She 



shook her hair hard. Her skinny body shuddered. “It’s getting late,” she said 
softly. “Let’s all go home. I need to think about this. Maybe we need to ask Mr. 
Levy for an investigation. Maybe he can help us find the culprit who is trying to 
ruin our play.” 

Oh, no, I thought. Not the principal. What if he decides to cancel our play? 
But I didn’t say anything. None of us did. We didn’t even look at one another. 
We followed Ms. Walker out into the hall. 

I was just so relieved that she had started to believe us. And that she was 
letting us go. 

She clicked on a hall light so we could see our way. 

We took a few steps, walking behind her. 

Then we all stopped at once. 

We all saw the red paint spots on the hall floor. A trail of red paint spots. 

“Well, look at this!” Ms. Walker declared. “Our painter was a little careless. 
He or she left a trail to follow.” 

She clicked on more lights. 

We followed the red paint splotches down the long hall. We could clearly 
see a shoe print in one of the bigger paint puddles. 

“I don’t believe this!” Zeke whispered to me. “Someone left a trail.” 

“I’m glad,” I whispered back. “Maybe the paint drips will lead us to the one 
who splotched up the backdrop.” 

“You mean the Phantom?” Zeke whispered. 

We turned a corner. We passed a small paint smear. 

“At least this will prove to Ms. Walker that we’re telling the truth,” Brian 
said softly. 

We turned another corner. 

The paint trail stopped suddenly. One last tiny red puddle stood in front of a 
locker. 

“Hmmmm,” Ms. Walker said thoughtfully, moving her eyes from the paint 
smear to the locker. “The trail seems to lead right to here.” 

“Hey!” Zeke cried out, startling all of us. I could see his eyes go wide with 
shock. “That’s my locker!”

No one said anything for a moment. 

I could hear Zeke’s breaths, short and fast. I turned to him. He was staring 
at his locker, staring hard at the gray metal door as if he could see inside. 

“Open your locker, Zeke,” Ms. Walker instructed. She said it through 
gritted teeth. 

“Huh?” Zeke gaped at her, as if he didn’t understand what she meant. He 
lowered his eyes to the smear of red paint on the floor under his locker door. 

“Go ahead. Open your locker,” Ms. Walker repeated patiently. She suddenly 
looked very tired. 

Zeke hesitated. “But there’s nothing in there,” he protested. “Just books and 
notebooks and stuff.” 

“Please.” Ms. Walker motioned to the combination lock with one hand. 
“Please, Zeke. It’s really late.” 

“But you don’t think—?” Zeke started. 

Ms. Walker motioned to the lock again. 

“Maybe somebody wanted to make it look like Zeke was the one with the 
paint,” I suggested. “Maybe someone deliberately made that trail of paint lead to 
Zeke’s locker.” 

“Maybe,” Ms. Walker replied calmly. “That’s why I want him to open his 
locker.” 

“Okay, okay,” Zeke muttered. His hand shook as he reached for the 
combination lock. He leaned his head forward and concentrated as he spun the 
dial, first one direction, then the other. 

“Give me some light,” he said edgily. 

I backed up. “Sorry.” I didn’t realize I was standing in his light. 

I glanced at Brian. He had his hands shoved in his pockets. He leaned 
against the wall and stared intently at Zeke’s hands as Zeke twirled the lock. 

Finally, Zeke pulled the lock open with a loud click. 

He lifted the handle and pulled open the door. 

I leaned forward to peer inside at the same time as Ms. Walker. We nearly 
bumped heads. 

We both saw the can of paint at the same time. 



A small can of red paint resting on the locker floor. 

The lid wasn’t on tight. Splashes of red paint dripped over the side of the 

can. 

“But it isn’t mine!” Zeke wailed. 

Ms. Walker let out a long sigh. “I’m sorry, Zeke.” 

“It isn’t mine!” Zeke whined. “Really, Ms. Walker! It isn’t!” 

“I’m going to call your parents to come in for a serious talk,” Ms. Walker 
said, biting her lower lip. “And, of course, you’re out of the play.” 

“Oh, nooo!” Zeke moaned. He slammed the locker door shut as hard as he 
could. The crash echoed down the long, empty hall. 

Ms. Walker flinched from the sound. She flashed Zeke an angry look. Then 
she turned to Brian and me. “So you two were also involved? Tell the truth!” 

“No!” Brian and I both called out. “We didn’t do it,” I added. I started to 
say, “Neither did Zeke.” 

But I could see that it was too late. There was no way to argue against the 
can of paint in the locker. 

Zeke was a cooked goose. 

“If I find out that you and Brian had anything to do with it, I’ll remove you 
from the play and call your parents in, too,” Ms. Walker threatened. “Now go 
home. All of you.” 

We turned and trudged out the door without another word. 

The night air felt cold against my hot skin. I shivered. 

The half-moon was covered by a sheet of gray mist. The mist looked like a 
ghostly figure floating over the moon. 

I followed Zeke and Brian down the concrete steps. A gust of wind made 
my jacket flap behind me. 

“Do you believe it?” Zeke muttered angrily. “Do you believe it?” 

“No,” I replied, shaking my head. Poor Zeke. I could see he was really 
messed up. And when his parents got that call from Ms. Walker, Zeke was going 
to be even more messed up! 

“How did that paint get in your locker?” Brian asked him, his eyes peering 
into Zeke’s. 

Zeke turned away. “How should I know?” he snapped. 

We made our way to the sidewalk. Zeke angrily kicked an empty cardboard 
juice box into the street. 

“See you tomorrow, I guess,” Brian said unhappily. He gave us a little 



wave, then turned and started walking slowly toward his house. 

Zeke jogged off in the other direction. 

“Aren’t you going to walk home with me?” I called. 

“No,” he shouted back, and kept going. 

In a way I was glad he had left. I didn’t really know what to say to him. 

I just felt so bad. 

I started walking slowly, my head down, thinking hard, when I saw a small, 
round light floating toward me through the darkness. 

The light grew bigger. I realized it was a bicycle headlight. The bike turned 
out of the school parking lot and rolled smoothly, steadily toward me. 

When it was a few feet away, I recognized the bike rider. “Tina!” I cried in 
surprise. “What are you doing here?” 

She squealed to a stop, bouncing in the seat. Her dark eyes caught the light 
of the streetlamp above us. She smiled. An odd smile. 

“Hi, Brooke. How’s it going?” she asked. 

Was she in the school? I wondered. Did she just come out of the school? 

“Where’d you come from?” I repeated. 

Her strange smile remained on her face. “A friend’s,” she said. “I’m just 
coming from a friend’s.” 

“Were you in the school?” I blurted out. 

“The school? No. Not me,” she replied. She shifted her weight, then raised 
her feet to the pedals. “Better zip up that jacket, Brooke,” she said. “You don’t 
want to catch a cold, do you?”

On Saturday we had play rehearsals all day long in the auditorium. The 
performance was only a week away. 

We all worked hard, and the rehearsal went well. I only forgot my lines 
twice. 

But it wasn’t the same without Zeke. 

Robert Hernandez had taken Zeke’s place. I like Robert, but he’s a very 
serious guy. He doesn’t get my jokes, and he doesn’t like to kid around or be 
kidded. 

After lunch, Robert and Corey were rehearsing a scene together. Ms. 
Walker still hadn’t returned from lunch. 

I wandered over to Brian. He had a paintbrush in his hand, dripping with 
black paint. He was leaning over the new backdrop, putting some final touches 
on the gray bricks. 

“Looks good,” I told him. I had a sudden urge to slap him on the back and 
make him smear black paint all over. But I decided that might not go over too 
well. 

I don’t know where these sudden urges come from. 

“How’s it going?” Brian asked without looking up. He was filling in some 
spots he had missed. 

“Okay, I guess,” I replied. Across the stage, I saw Tina working with a large 
glue pot. She was brushing a thick layer of glue onto a cardboard chandelier. 

“Robert is going to be a good phantom,” Brian said, scratching his chin 
with the tip of the paintbrush handle. 

“Yeah,” I agreed. “But I kind of miss Zeke.” 

Brian nodded. Then he turned to look up at me. “You know what? There 
hasn’t been one practical joke since Zeke left. No scenery ruined. No mysterious 
phantoms leaping out at us. No threatening words scrawled on the walls. 
Nothing. Nothing bad since Ms. Walker kicked Zeke out.” 

I hadn’t thought about it until that second. But Brian was right. Ever since 
Zeke had been removed from the play, the Phantom had totally disappeared. 

Everything had been going so smoothly. I hadn’t even stopped to realize it. 

Did this mean that Zeke actually was the Phantom? That Zeke had been 



doing all those horrible things after all? 

“Did Zeke’s parents have a cow when Ms. Walker called them in to 
school?” Brian asked. “Did he get punished?” 

“For sure,” I replied, still thinking about the Phantom. “His parents 
grounded him for life. And they took away his VCR. That means no horror 
movies. Zeke can’t live without horror movies!” 

Brian snickered. “Maybe Zeke has seen too many horror movies,” he said. 

“Okay, people!” a voice called loudly. I turned to see that Ms. Walker had 
returned from lunch. “Let’s take it from the opening of Act Two,” she called. 
“We’ll do the whole act.” 

I said good-bye to Brian and hurried to the front of the stage. Esmerelda 
was in just about every scene of Act Two. This time, I was determined to 
remember every word. 

As I stepped beside Robert, I saw Ms. Walker pick up her script from the 
table where she always left it. She grasped it in both hands and started to open it 
to Act Two. 

I watched her expression change as her hands worked at the script. She let 
out a short, angry cry. Then she tugged some more at the thick script. 

“Hey—” she shouted angrily. “Now who’s the joker?” 

“Ms. Walker, what’s wrong?” Robert called. 

She raised the script and shook it furiously. 

“The pages of my script—they’ve all been glued together!” she fumed. 

Startled gasps rose up around the stage. 

“That’s it!” Ms. Walker cried. She heaved the script at the wall. “That was 
the last joke! The play is canceled! Everybody go home! It’s canceled!”

“Did Ms. Walker change her mind?” Zeke asked. 

I nodded. “Yeah. She calmed down after a few seconds and said the play 
could go on. But she was in a really bad mood for the rest of the day.” 

“At least this time she couldn’t blame me,” Zeke said quietly. He tossed a 
pink rubber ball across the living room, and Buster, his black cocker spaniel, 
went scrambling after it. 

Brian and I had dropped by Zeke’s house to tell him how things were going. 
Zeke was grounded—probably forever—and couldn’t leave the house. His 
parents were at the movies. They’d be home in a few hours. 

Buster dropped the ball and started barking at Brian. 

Zeke laughed. “He doesn’t like you, Brian.” He picked up the ball and 
bounced it over the carpet again. 

But Buster ignored the ball and kept barking at Brian. 

Brian blushed. He reached out to pet the dog’s head. “What’s your problem, 
fella? I’m not a bad guy.” 

Buster scampered away from Brian and crossed the room to search for the 
ball, which had rolled into the hallway. 

“Well, I guess this proves there’s some other joker in the class,” Zeke said, 
his smile fading. He settled back on the couch. “Guess this proves that it wasn’t 
me doing all the bad things.” 

I started to make a joke, but I caught the serious expression on Zeke’s face. 
So I didn’t say anything. 

“There’s a phantom, and it isn’t me,” Zeke said. “And now everyone thinks 
I’m a liar. Ms. Walker thinks I tried to ruin the play. Even my parents think I’ve 
turned into a bad guy.” 

“You were a much better phantom than Robert,” I said, trying to cheer him 
up. “There’s less than a week to go, and Robert still keeps messing up his lines. 
He says he’s sorry he tried out for the play. He doesn’t even want to be in it 
now.” 

Zeke jumped to his feet. “If we could prove that I’m not the Phantom, I’ll 
bet Ms. Walker would give the part back to me.” 

“Uh-oh,” I said. I could see Zeke’s mind working. I knew what he was 



going to say next. 

“Uh-oh,” Brian echoed. He also knew what Zeke was going to say. 

“Let’s go to school,” Zeke said, his eyes wide with excitement. “Let’s find 
the Phantom this time. I really want to get my part back.” 

I shook my head. “No way, Zeke—” I started. 

“I really want to show everyone that I didn’t try to min the play,” Zeke 
insisted. 

Brian tossed the ball to the dog. The dog watched it bounce away. “But 
you’re grounded, remember?” Brian said to Zeke. 

Zeke shrugged. “If we find the Phantom and prove that I’m innocent, my 
parents will be glad I went. And I won’t be grounded anymore. Come on, guys. 
One more try. Please?” 

I stared back at Zeke, thinking hard. I didn’t think it was a good idea. The 
last time we sneaked into the auditorium, we ended up in major trouble. 

I could see by Brian’s expression that he didn’t want to go, either. 

But how could we say no to Zeke? He was practically begging us! 

It was a warm night, but I felt chilled just the same. As we walked to school, I 
kept seeing shadows moving close as if reaching for us. But when I turned to see 
them, they vanished. 

Brooke, you have too much imagination, I scolded myself. 

I wished my heart would stop thudding like a bass drum. 

I wished I were home, watching TV with Jeremy. I had a bad feeling about 
our little adventure. Avery bad feeling. 

We didn’t waste any time trying the doors. We climbed into the school 
through the same home ec room window. Then, once again we made our way 
silently down the dark halls to the auditorium. 

One row of lights had been left on at the back of the seats. The stage lay 
dark and bare, except for the gray brick backdrop against the back wall. 

Zeke led the way down the center aisle. He had given us each a flashlight. 
We clicked them on as we made our way to the stage. The beams of light played 
over the empty rows of seats. I raised mine to the stage and swept it from side to 
side. 

No one up there. No sign of anything unusual. 

“Zeke, this is a waste of time,” I said, whispering even though no one could 
hear us. 



He raised a finger to his lips. “We’re going down below the stage,” Zeke 
said quietly, his eyes straight ahead. “And we’re going to find him, Brooke. This 
time, we’re going to find him.” 

I had never seen Zeke so serious, so determined. A chill of fear went slowly 
down my back. But I decided not to argue with him. 

“Uh... maybe I should stay up on the stage while you two go down,” Brian 
suggested. “I could stand guard.” 

“Stand guard against what?” Zeke demanded, raising his flashlight to 
Brian’s face. 

I could see Brian’s frightened expression. “Against... anyone who might 
come,” he replied weakly. 

“All three of us have to go down,” Zeke insisted. “If we do find the 
Phantom, I want two witnesses—you and Brooke.” 

“But the Phantom is a qhost —right?” Brian demanded. “How do we find a 
ghost?” 

Zeke glared at him. “We’ll find him.” 

Brian shrugged. We could both see that there was no point in arguing with 
Zeke tonight. 

The floorboards on the stage creaked as we made our way to the trapdoor. 
Our flashlights moved over the outline of the square platform in the floor. 

Brian and I huddled close together in the center of the square. Zeke 
stomped hard on the little wooden peg, then jumped beside us. 

We heard the familiar clanking sound. Then the gentle hum as the platform 
started to lower. The stage appeared to rise up all around us. In a few seconds, 
we were surrounded by four black walls. 

The light from our flashlights washed over the walls as we sank lower and 
lower under the stage. My heart felt as if it were sinking, too—down to my 
knees! 

The three of us stood pressed together in the center of the platform. The 
clanking and grinding sounds grew louder as we went down. Finally, we hit the 
bottom with a hard thud. 

For a few seconds, none of us moved. 

Zeke was the first to step off the platform. He raised his flashlight and 
swept it slowly around. We were in the middle of a large, empty chamber. It 
tunneled out in two directions. 

“Here, Phantom! Here, boy!” Zeke called softly, as if calling his dog. 



“Here, Phantom. Where are you, Phantom?” he called in a singsong voice. 

I stepped off the platform and gave him a shove. “Stop it,” I insisted. “I 
thought you were serious about this. Why are you making a joke of it?” 

“Just trying to keep you from getting too scared,” Zeke replied. But, of 
course, I knew the truth. He was trying to keep himself from getting too scared. 

I turned back to Brian. In the dim light, he looked scared enough for both of 
us! “There’s no one down here. Can we go back up now?” he pleaded. 

“No way,” Zeke told him. “Follow me. Keep your light down on the ground 
so we can see where we’re going.” 

Walking side by side, Brian and I followed Zeke into the chamber. We 
stepped into a long tunnel, took a few steps, then stopped to listen. 

Silence. 

My legs were trembling. In fact, my entire body was shaking. But Zeke was 
acting so brave. There was no way I’d let him know how frightened I was. 

“This tunnel probably stretches all the way under the school,” Zeke 
whispered, moving his light ahead of us. “Maybe even farther. Maybe it goes 
under the entire block!” 

We took another few steps—then stopped when we heard a noise behind us. 

A clanking, followed by a loud hum. 

“Hey!” Brian cried out shrilly. “The trapdoor!” 

All three of us spun around and started running back toward it. Our heavy 
footsteps echoed loudly through the dark tunnel. 

My chest was aching so hard by the time we got back to the trapdoor 
platform, I could hardly breathe. 

“It—it’s going back up!” Zeke cried. 

We stood there helplessly, gazing at the platform as it rose over our heads, 
climbing back up to the stage. 

“Push the switch!” Zeke cried to me. “Bring it back down!” 

I fumbled on the wall till I found the switch. I tried to move it. But it was 
stuck. 

No. It had been locked. 

It wouldn’t budge. 

The trapdoor platform stopped high above us. 

A heavy silence fell over the three of us as we stared up in the darkness. 

“Zeke, now we’re trapped down here,” I uttered. “There’s no way back up. 
We’re totally trapped.” 



20 


We waited to see if someone was coming down. But the trapdoor remained 
closed up there. 

Brian let out a frightened sigh. “Somebody did it,” he whispered, staring up 
to the platform. “Somebody pushed the switch and sent it back up.” 

“The Phantom!” I cried. I turned to Zeke. “Now what?” 

Zeke shrugged. “Now we have no choice. If we want to get out of here, we 
have to find the Phantom!” 

Our circles of yellow light trembled over the floor as we turned and headed 
back into the tunnel. No one said a word as we followed it around one curve, 
then another. 

The floor became soft and muddy. The air grew cooler. 

I heard a soft, chittering sound in the distance. I hoped it wasn’t a bat. 

Brian and I had to hurry to keep up with Zeke. 

He was taking long strides, his flashlight swinging back and forth in front 
of him. 

Suddenly, I heard low, musical humming. It took me a while to realize it 
was coming from Zeke. He was humming a tune to himself. 

Come on, Zeke, give me a break! I thought. You’ve got to be scared! You 
can’t fool me with a little cheerful humming. You are as scared as I am! 

I started to tease him about it. But the tunnel suddenly ended, and we found 
ourselves at a low doorway. Brian hung back. But Zeke and I stepped up to the 
door, our flashlights beaming over it. 

“Anyone in there?” Zeke called in a strange, tiny voice. 

No reply. 

I reached out and pushed the door. It creaked open. Zeke and I raised our 
flashlights and aimed them inside. 

A room. All furnished. I saw a folding chair. A beat-up couch with one of 
the cushions missing. Bookshelves along one wall. 

My flashlight fell over a small table. A bowl and a box of cornflakes stood 
on the table. I swept the light around and saw a small, unmade bed against the 
far wall. 

Zeke and Brian followed me into the room. Our beams of light slid slowly 



over every object, every piece of furniture. An old-fashioned record player stood 
on a low table. A stack of old records was piled beside it. 

“Do you believe this?” Zeke whispered. A grin spread over his face. 

“I think we’ve found the Phantom’s home,” I whispered back. 

His flashlight tilting in front of him, Brian made his way to the table. He 
peered down at the cereal bowl. “The Phantom—he was just here,” Brian said. 
“The cereal isn’t soggy yet.” 

“This is amazing!” I cried. “Someone actually lives down here, way below 
the—” 

I stopped because I felt a sneeze coming on. Maybe a whole sneezing fit. 

I tried to hold it in. But I couldn’t. I sneezed once. Twice. Five times. 

“Stop it, Brooke!” Brian pleaded. “He’ll hear you!” 

“But we want to find him,” Zeke reminded Brian. 

I sneezed seven times. Then one more for good luck. Finally, I was all 
sneezed out. 

“He heard that. I know he did,” Brian fretted. His eyes darted around in fear. 
The door slammed shut. 

“Nooo!” We all jumped and cried out. 

My heart leaped to my mouth. Every muscle in my body tied itself into a 

knot. 

We turned to stare at the door. Someone had closed it, I knew. It hadn’t been 
blown shut by any wind. 

Zeke was the first to move. Lowering his flashlight, he hurtled to the door. 
He grabbed the knob and pushed hard. 

The door didn’t budge. 

Zeke lowered his shoulder against the door. Twisting the knob, he pushed 
again. 

Still no success. 

He banged his shoulder against the door. Pushed again. Strained against the 
door with all his weight. 

When he turned back to us, his face revealed his fear for the first time. “We 
—we’re locked in,” he said softly. 



21 


I rushed up beside Zeke. “Maybe if all three of us try,” I suggested. 

“Maybe,” Zeke replied. But I could see he didn’t have much hope. 

I swallowed hard. Seeing Zeke so frightened made me even more 
frightened. 

“Yeah. Let’s all push together,” Brian agreed, stepping up beside me. “We 
can break the door down if we have to.” 

Way to go, Brian! I thought. He’s finally showing some spirit. 

We lined up against the door and prepared to push. 

I took another deep breath and held it. I was trying to calm myself down. 
My arms and legs felt as if they were made of chewing gum. 

This is just so scary, I realized. If we are locked in this tiny room and can’t 
get out, we could be here for the rest of our lives. We are miles and miles away 
from the rest of the world. 

Everyone will search and search up above. And they’ll never find us. And 
even if we yell and scream at the tops of our lungs for help, there’s no way 
anyone could hear us. 

We’ll be trapped here forever. 

I took another deep breath. “Okay, on the count of three,” I said. “On three, 
everybody push.” 

Zeke started to count. “One... two...” 

“Whoa! Wait a minute!” I interrupted. I stared at the door. “We pushed the 
door to get in here—right?” 

“Yeah, I guess,” Zeke replied, staring hard at me. 

“So it won’t push open from inside,” I said. “We have to pull it open.” 

“Hey—you’re right!” Zeke cried. 

I grabbed the knob, twisted it, and pulled hard. 

The door slid open easily. 

And there was a man standing in the doorway. 

My flashlight moved up to his face. I recognized him instantly. 

Emile. The little, white-haired man who said he was the night janitor. 

He blocked the doorway and glared in at us, an ugly, menacing scowl on his 



scarred face. 



22 


“Let us go!” I shrieked. 

He didn’t move. His strange, gray eyes moved from Zeke to Brian to me. 

“You have to let us out of here!” I insisted. And then I added meekly, 
“Please?” 

His scowl grew even angrier. The light from the flashlight made the long 
scar on his cheek look even deeper. 

He didn’t budge from the doorway. “Why are you down here?” he 
demanded in his hoarse whisper of a voice. “Why are you in my home?” 

“So—you are the Phantom!” I blurted out. 

He narrowed his eyes at me in surprise. “Phantom?” His expression turned 
thoughtful. “I guess you could call me that.” 

Brian uttered a low cry. 

“This is my home sweet home,” the man said angrily. “Why are you here? 
Why didn’t you listen to my warnings?” 

“Your warnings?” I asked. I was shaking so hard, the light from my 
flashlight was dancing all over the wall. 

“I did everything I could to keep you away,” the Phantom said. “To keep 
you from my home.” 

“You mean the paint on the backdrop? Swinging down from the catwalk? 
The scary mask in my locker with the note?” I cried in astonishment. 

The Phantom nodded. “I tried to warn you. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. 
But I had to protect my home.” 

“And so you tried to stop our play?” Zeke demanded, huddling close to me. 
“You tried to ruin our play so we wouldn’t use the trapdoor and find you down 
here?” 

The Phantom nodded. 

“And what happened seventy-two years ago?” I asked him. “What 
happened to you the first time the play was supposed to be performed? Why did 
you disappear that night?” 

The Phantom’s expression changed. I saw confusion in his silvery eyes. “I 
—I don’t understand,” he stammered, staring hard at me, his white hair falling 
over his forehead. 



“Seventy-two years ago,” I insisted. 

A bitter smile formed on his lips. “Hey, I’m not that old!” he replied. “I’m 
only fifty-seven.” 

“Then... you’re not the Phantom?” Zeke asked uncertainly. 

Emile shook his head. He let out a weary sigh. “I don’t understand this 
Phantom talk, young man. I’m just a poor homeless guy trying to protect my 
little space.” 

All three of us studied him, trying to decide if he was telling the truth. I 
decided that he was. “You’ve been living here under the school?” I asked softly. 
“How did you know about this room down here?” 

“My father worked at the school for thirty years,” Emile replied. “He used 
to bring me here with him when I was a kid. When I lost my apartment in town, I 
remembered this space. I’ve been living here ever since. For nearly six months 
now.” 

His eyes glared angrily again. He brushed the hair off his forehead as his 
ugly scowl returned. “But you’re mining it for me, aren’t you?” he said sharply. 
“You’re ruining it all for me.” 

He moved quickly, stepping from the doorway, entering the room, walking 
toward us with that menacing expression. 

I stumbled back. “Wh-what are you going to do to us?” I cried. 



23 


“You mined everything. Everything,” he repeated, moving toward us. 

“Now, wait—” I cried, raising my hands as if to shield myself. 

Then I heard a sound. From out in the tunnel. A low clanking sound. 

I turned to Zeke and Brian. They heard it, too. 

The trapdoor! It was moving. Coming down. We could hear it at the other 
end of the tunnel. 

I think all three of us had the same idea at once. We had to get to that 
trapdoor. It was our only chance of escape. 

“You ruined everything,” Emile repeated, suddenly sounding more sad than 
angry. “Why didn’t you listen to my warnings?” 

Without saying a word to each other, Zeke, Brian, and I charged for the 
door. “Oh!” I bumped into Emile as I scooted past. 

To my surprise, he didn’t reach out to grab me, didn’t try to stop me. 

I led the way out the door, running at full speed. My legs still felt as rubbery 
as chewing gum. But I forced them to move. One running step, then another. 

I didn’t glance back. But I could hear Zeke and Brian at my heels. And then 
I heard Emile’s voice echoing through the tunnels: “You ruined everything. 
Everything!” 

Was Emile chasing after us? 

I didn’t care. I just wanted to get to that trapdoor platform and get out of 
there! 

I plunged blindly through the dark, curving tunnel. My sneakers sank into 
the soft dirt floor as I ran. My shoulder scraped the rough wall, but I didn’t slow 
down. 

The light bounced over the ground at my feet. I raised it as the trapdoor 
platform came into view. I was gasping for breath. My side ached from running. 

“Huh? What are you doing down here?” a man’s voice called. 

Zeke’s dad! 

Zeke, Brian, and I scrambled on to the platform, squeezing beside him. 

“What’s going on?” Mr. Matthews demanded. “Whose voice is that?” 

“Up!” I managed to choke out. “Take us up.” 



Zeke reached out and flipped the switch. This time it moved. 

With a hard jerk, the platform started to raise itself. 

I gazed back to the tunnel. Had Emile followed after us? 

No. No sign of him. 

He hadn’t even chased us. 

Weird, I thought. So weird. 

“I heard a man’s voice. Who was that?” Mr. Matthews demanded again. 

“A homeless guy. Living beneath the stage,” I said, explaining what 
happened and how he had been trying to scare us for weeks. 

“How did you know we were down there?” Zeke asked his dad. 

“You were supposed to be at home,” he replied sternly. “You were 
grounded. You’re still grounded. But when you weren’t at home, I figured I’d 
find you poking around the stage again. The side door to the school was open. I 
entered the auditorium and heard the trapdoor moving. I decided to see what was 
going on.” 

“I’m so glad!” I cried. I felt like hugging Mr. Matthews. 

As soon as the platform stopped, we scrambled to the stage. Zeke’s dad 
hurried to call the police. He told them there was a homeless guy living under 
the school. 

The police arrived quickly. We watched them go down the trapdoor. We 
waited for them to bring Emile up. But they returned a few minutes later without 
him. 

“No one down there,” an officer reported. He removed his helmet and 
scratched his black, wavy hair. “No sign of anyone, either. Just a bed and some 
old furniture.” 

“What about his food? His books?” I asked. 

“All gone,” the officer replied. “Guess he cleared out real fast. The 
basement door was still slightly open.” 

After the police left, Brian said good night and headed out of the 
auditorium. Zeke’s dad was going to drive me home. 

I turned to Zeke. “So, there’s your Phantom,” I said with a little sadness. 
“Just a poor homeless man. Not a seventy-two-year-old ghost who’s been 
haunting the school since it was built. Just a poor homeless man.” 

“Yeah, it’s disappointing,” Zeke replied, frowning. “I really wanted to meet 
a real ghost, a real phantom.” His expression brightened. “But at least now Ms. 
Walker will believe me. And I’ll get my part in the play back.” 



The play. I’d almost forgotten about the play. 

Zeke was right, I thought happily. He’ll get his part back now. Everything 
will go fine. 

The Phantom is gone. 

Now we can all relax, I thought. Now we can enjoy ourselves and put on a 
great performance. 

Wow. Was I wrong! 



24 


The night of the performance, I sat in the girls’ dressing room, smearing globs of 
stage makeup all over my face. I’d never worn so much makeup before, and 
didn’t think I was doing it right. I didn’t even want to wear the gunk in the first 
place. 

But Ms. Walker said we all had to. Even the guys. She said it cuts down on 
the glare from the lights and makes your face less shiny on stage. 

It was a wild scene in the girls’ dressing room. We were all struggling into 
our costumes and brushing on makeup. Lisa Rego and Gia Bentley—two fifth- 
graders who didn’t even have big parts in the play—were hogging the full-length 
mirror, laughing and giggling and admiring themselves. 

By the time I got to check myself out, the stage manager was calling, 
“Places! Places, everyone!” 

My stomach jumped. Calm down, Brooke, I ordered myself. This is 
supposed to be fun—remember? 

I stepped out of the dressing room, crossed the hall, entered the auditorium 
through the stage door, and took my place at the side of the stage. Someone 
tapped me on the shoulder, and I jumped a mile. Man, was I jittery! 

I whirled around and found myself face-to-face with the Phantom! 

I knew it was only Zeke in his costume and mask, but he startled me just 
the same. “Zeke! You look so real! You look awesome!” I told him. 

Zeke didn’t reply. He gave me a very formal bow from the waist, then 
hurried to take his place. 

The curtain was closed. But I could hear the steady rumble of voices out in 
the auditorium. I peeked out of the side of the curtain. Wow! Every seat was 
filled. That thought sent my stomach doing jumping jacks all over again. 

The lights began to dim. The audience instantly became silent. The stage 
lights went up. The music started. 

Go for it, Brooke, I told myself. Just go for it! 

The play didn’t get strange until the end of the first act. We were all doing really 
well until then. 

When the curtain opened, and the audience applauded the set, I stepped out 



onstage with Corey. And I completely forgot about my stage fright. 

“Be careful, daughter,” Corey warned, playing my father. “There’s a 
creature living beneath this theater. A twisted phantom, scarred and ugly.” 

“I do not believe you, Father,” I replied as Esmerelda. “You are only trying 
to control me, to keep me a child!” 

The audience seemed to be having a great time. They laughed in the right 
places and applauded several times. 

This is excellent! I thought. I was excited without being nervous. I was 
enjoying every minute of the performance. 

And as the first act drew near its end, I knew the real highlight of the show 
was coming. A fog of dry ice swept slowly over the stage. Blue lights swirled 
through the twisting fog, making it appear eerie and unreal. 

I heard the clank of the trapdoor. I knew it was carrying Zeke in his 
Phantom costume up from down below. 

In seconds, the Phantom would make his big entrance, rising up in the blue 

fog. 

The audience will love it, I thought, watching the fog billow up over my 
long, yellow dress. 

“Phantom, is that you?” I called. “Are you coming to see me?” 

The Phantom’s blue-and-green mask floated up in the fog. Then his black- 
caped shoulders hovered into view. 

The audience gasped and then cheered as the Phantom rose, standing stiffly 
in the fog, his black cape billowing out behind him. 

And then he stepped toward me, walking slowly, majestically. 

“Oh, Phantom! We are together at last!” I cried with all the emotion I could 
put into it. “I have dreamed of this moment for so long!” 

I took his gloved hand and led him through the swirls of blue fog to the 
front of the stage. 

A white spotlight captured us both. 

I turned to face him. Stared into his eyes behind the blue-and-green mask. 

And realized instantly that it wasn’t Zeke! 



25 


I started to cry out. But he squeezed my hand. 

His eyes burned into mine. He seemed to be begging me with his eyes, 
begging me not to say anything, not to give him away. 

Who is he? I wondered, frozen in the bright spotlight. Why does he look 
familiar? 

I turned back to the audience. Silent. Waiting for me to speak. 

I took a deep breath and said Esmerelda’s next line. “Phantom, why do you 
haunt this theater? Please tell me your story. I will not be afraid.” 

The Phantom swept his cape behind him. His eyes were still locked on 
mine. His gloved hand still squeezed mine tightly, as if to keep me from 
escaping. 

“I have lived under this theater for more than seventy years,” he declared. 
“My story is a sad one. You might even call it tragic, my fair Esmerelda.” 

“Please continue!” I exclaimed. 

Who is he? I asked myself. Who? 

“I was chosen to star in a play,” the Phantom revealed. “A play in this very 
theater. It was to be the greatest night of my life!” 

He paused to take a long, deep breath. 

My heart skipped a beat. He isn’t reciting the script, I realized. Those aren’t 
the right words. 

What is he saying? 

“But my great night was never to be!” the Phantom continued, still gripping 
my hand. “You see, my dear Esmerelda, an hour before the play was to begin, I 
fell. I plunged to my death!” 

I gasped. He was pointing to the trapdoor. 

I realized who he was now. He was the boy who had disappeared. The boy, 
seventy-two years ago, who was to star as the Phantom. But disappeared and 
was never found. 

Here he was, standing beside me on the same stage. Here he was, revealing 
to us all how he had disappeared, why the play was never performed. 

“There!” he cried, pointing to the opening in the stage floor. “That’s where I 
fell! There! I fell to my death. I became a real phantom. And I’ve waited down 



there ever since, waiting, waiting. Hoping for a night like tonight where I could 
finally play my greatest role!” 

As he finished this speech, the audience burst into cheers and loud 
applause. 

They think it’s part of the play, I realized. They don’t know the true pain 
behind his words. They don’t know that he’s revealing his true story to them. 

The Phantom took a deep bow. The applause grew even louder. 

The fog billowed over us both. 

Who is he ? Who ? 

The question repeated in my mind. 

I had to know the answer. I had to know who the Phantom was. 

As he stood up from his bow, I pulled my hand free of his. 

Then I reached up—and tugged off his mask! 



26 


I squinted into the thick, blue fog, desperate to see his face. 

The bright spotlight flashed in my eyes, blinding me for a moment. 

In that moment, the Phantom covered his face with both hands. 

I reached to pull away his hands. 

“No!” he screamed. “No—you can’t!” 

He staggered back, away from me. 

Staggered and lost his balance. 

“No! No!” he cried. “You can’t! You can’t!” 

And toppled backwards. 

Into the open trapdoor. 

And vanished in the swirling blue fog. 

I heard his scream all the way down. 

Then silence. 

A horrible, still silence. 

The audience rose to its feet and burst into loud applause and cries of 
“Bravo!” 

They all thought it was part of the play. 

But I knew better. I knew that the Phantom had finally revealed himself 
after seventy-two years. That he had finally had his moment on the stage. 

And that he had died all over again. 

As the curtain closed, muffling the excited cheers of the audience, I stood at 
the opening in the floor, my hands pressed to my face. 

I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t move. 

I stared down into the hole in the floor and saw only blackness. 

Then, raising my eyes, I saw Zeke running across the stage to me. Wearing 
jeans and a white T-shirt, he lurched toward me, his expression dazed. 

“Zeke!” I cried. 

“Ow. Someone hit me, I think,” he moaned, rubbing the back of his head. 
“I’ve been out cold.” He raised his eyes to mine. “Brooke, are you okay? Did 
_?” 

“The Phantom!” I cried. “He took your part, Zeke. He—he’s down there!” I 



pointed into the opening. “We’ve got to find him!” 

I stepped on the peg. The trapdoor clanked and groaned. The platform 
returned to the top. 

Zeke and I climbed aboard. 

We rode it down, down to the dark chamber below. 

We searched every corner. We didn’t find him. We didn’t find the mask. Or 
the costume. Or anything. Somehow I knew we wouldn’t. Somehow I knew we 
would never see him again. 

“Great job, people! Great job!” Ms. Walker called to us as we trooped offstage. 
“Phantom, I liked the new lines you added! Great job! See you all at the cast 
party!” 

Zeke and I struggled to get to the dressing room so we could get changed. 
But we were mobbed by people who wanted to congratulate us and tell us how 
talented and terrific we were. 

The play was a major success! 

I searched for Brian. I wanted to tell him all about the Phantom. But I 
couldn’t see him in the excited crowd of friends and parents. 

“Come on—let’s get out of here!” Zeke cried. He pulled me by the hand out 
of the auditorium and into the hall. 

“Wow! We’re a hit!” I exclaimed, feeling totally wrecked and pumped and 
dazed and crazed, all at the same time. 

“Let’s just get our coats and get changed at home,” Zeke suggested. “We 
can try to figure out who played my part on the way. Then we can meet at my 
house to go to the party.” 

“Okay,” I agreed. “But we have to hurry. My parents are waiting to tell me 
what a fabulous star lam!” 

The sound of excited chattering and laughter drifted from the auditorium 
and followed us as we made our way to our lockers. 

“Hey—” I stopped in front of my locker. “Look, Zeke—the door is open. I 
didn’t leave it unlocked.” 

“Weird,” Zeke murmured. 

I pulled the door all the way open, and a book toppled out onto the floor. 

I bent to pick it up. It was an old book, its brown cover worn and dusty. I 
turned it around, squinting to read the cover in the dim hall light. 

“It’s a really old yearbook,” I told Zeke. “Look. It’s from this school. 



Woods Mill. But it’s from the 1920s.” 


“Huh? How’d it get in your locker?” Zeke asked, staring down at it. 

My eyes fell on a torn sheet of paper tucked inside. A bookmark. 

Gripping the heavy, old book in both hands, I opened to the pages marked 
by the bookmark. 

“Wow!” Zeke cried. “I don’t believe it!” 

We were staring at a yearbook article about the play we had just performed. 
“The Phantom To Be Performed in the Spring,” read the headline at the top. 

“This must have been written early that school year,” I said. “We know the 
play was never performed. We know the whole story of what happened back 
then.” 

“Hold the book up to the light,” Zeke instructed. “Let’s check out the 
pictures.” 

I raised the book, and we both stared down at the small photographs that 
covered the two pages. 

Then we saw it. 

A small, blurred black-and-white photo of the boy who had won the starring 
role, the boy who was to play the Phantom. The boy who had disappeared. 

The boy was Brian.

ATTACK OF 
THE MUTANT 


Goosebumps - 25 
R.L. Stine 





1 


“Hey—put that down!” 

I grabbed the comic book from Wilson Clark’s hand and smoothed out the 
plastic cover. 

“I was only looking at it,” he grumbled. 

“If you get a fingerprint on it, it will lose half its value,” I told him. I 
examined the cover through the clear wrapper. “This is a Silver Swan Number 
Zero,” I said. “And it’s in mint condition.” 

Wilson shook his head. He has curly, white-blond hair and round, blue eyes. 
He always looks confused. 

“How can it be Number Zero?” he asked. “That doesn’t make any sense, 
Skipper.” 

Wilson is a really good friend of mine. But sometimes I think he dropped 
down from the planet Mars. He just doesn’t know anything. 

I held up the Silver Swan cover so he could see the big zero in the corner. 
“That makes it a collector’s item,” I explained. “Number Zero comes before 
Number One. This comic is worth ten times as much as Silver Swan Number 
One.” 

“Huh? It is?” Wilson scratched his curly hair. He squatted down on the floor 
and started pawing through my carton of comic books. “How come all your 
comics are in these plastic bags, Skipper? How can you read them?” 

See? I told you. Wilson doesn’t know anything. 

“Read them? I don’t read them,” I replied. “If you read them, they lose their 
value.” 

He stared up at me. “You don’t read them?” 

“I can’t take them out of the bag,” I explained. “If I open the bag, they 
won’t be in mint condition anymore.” 

“Ooh. This one is cool!” he exclaimed. He pulled up a copy of Star Wolf. 
“The cover is metal!” 

“It’s worthless,” I mumbled. “It’s a second printing.” 

He stared at the silvery cover, turning it in his hands, making it shine in the 
light. “Cool,” he muttered. His favorite word. 

We were up in my room, about an hour after dinner. The sky was black 



outside my double windows. It gets dark so early in winter. Not like on the 
Silver Swan’s planet, Orcos III, where the sun never sets and all the superheroes 
have to wear air-conditioned costumes. 

Wilson came over to get the math homework. He lives next door, and he 
always leaves his math book at school—so he always comes over to get the 
homework from me. 

“You should collect comic books,” I told him. “In about twenty years, these 
will be worth millions.” 

“I collect rubber stamps,” he said, picking up a Z-Squad annual. He studied 
the sneaker ad on the back cover. 

“Rubber stamps?” 

“Yeah. I have about a hundred of them,” he said. 

“What can you do with rubber stamps?” I asked. 

He dropped the comic back into the carton and stood up. “Well, you can 
stamp things with them,” he said, brushing off the knees of his jeans. “I have 
different-colored ink pads. Or you can just look at them.” 

He is definitely weird. 

“Are they valuable?” I asked. 

He shook his head. “I don’t think so.” He picked up the math sheet from the 
foot of my bed. “I’d better get home, Skipper. See you tomorrow.” 

He started for the door and I followed him. Our reflections stared out at us 
from my big dresser mirror. Wilson is so tall and skinny and blond and blue¬ 
eyed. I always feel like a dark, chubby mole next to him. 

If we were in a comic book, Wilson would be the superhero, and I would be 
his sidekick. I’d be the pudgy, funny one who was always messing up. 

It’s a good thing life isn’t a comic book—right? 

As soon as Wilson left, I turned back to my dresser. My eye caught the big 
computer banner above the mirror: Skipper Matthews, Alien Avenger. 

My dad had someone at his office print out the banner for me for my 
twelfth birthday a few weeks ago. 

Beneath the banner, I have two great posters tacked on the wall on both 
sides of the dresser. One is a Jack Kirby Captain America. It’s really old and 
probably worth about a thousand dollars. 

The other one is newer—a Spawn poster by Todd McFarlane. It’s really 
awesome. 

In the mirror, I could see the excited look on my own face as I hurried to the 



dresser. 

The flat brown envelope waited for me on the dressertop. 

Mom and Dad said I couldn’t open it until after dinner, after I finished my 
homework. But I couldn’t wait. 

I could feel my heart start to pound as I stared down at the envelope. 

I knew what waited inside it. Just thinking about it made my heart pound 
even harder. 

I carefully picked up the envelope. I had to open it now. I had to. 



2 


Carefully, carefully, I tore the flap on the envelope. Then I reached inside and 
pulled out the treasure. 

This month’s issue of The Masked Mutant. 

Holding the comic book in both hands, I studied the cover. The Masked 
Mutant #24. In jagged red letters across the bottom, I read: “A TIGHT 
SQUEEZE FOR THE SENSATIONAL SPONGE!” 

The cover art was awesome. It showed SpongeLife—known across the 
universe as The Sponge of Steel—in terrible trouble. He was caught in the 
tentacles of a gigantic octopus. The octopus was squeezing him dry! 

Awesome. Totally awesome. 

I keep all of my comic books in mint condition, wrapped in collector’s 
bags. But there is one comic that I have to read every month. And that’s The 
Masked Mutant. 

I have to read it as soon as it comes out. And I read it cover to cover, every 
word in every panel. I even read the Letters page. 

That’s because The Masked Mutant is the best-drawn, best-written comic in 
the world. And The Masked Mutant has to be the most powerful, most evil 
villain ever created! 

What makes him so terrifying is that he can move his molecules around. 

That means he can change himself into anything that’s solid. Anything! 

On this cover, the giant octopus is actually the Masked Mutant. You can tell 
because the octopus is wearing the mask that The Masked Mutant always wears. 

But he can change himself into any animal. Or any object. 

That’s how he always escapes from The League of Good Guys. There are 
six different superheroes in The League of Good Guys. They are all mutants, 
too, with amazing powers. And they are the world’s best law enforcers. But they 
can’t catch The Masked Mutant. 

Even the League’s leader—The Galloping Gazelle—the fastest man in the 
solar system, isn’t fast enough to keep up with The Masked Mutant. 

I studied the cover for a few minutes. I liked the way the octopus tentacles 
squeezed SpongeLife into a limp rag. You could see by his expression that The 
Sponge of Steel was in mortal pain. 



Awesome. 

I carried the comic over to the bed and sprawled onto my stomach to read it. 
The story began where The Masked Mutant #23 left off. 

SpongeLife, the world’s best underwater swimmer, was deep in the ocean. 
He was desperately trying to escape from The Masked Mutant. But The Sponge 
of Steel had caught his cape on the edge of a coral reef. 

I turned the page. As The Masked Mutant drew nearer, he began to move 
his molecules around. And he changed himself into a huge, really gross octopus. 

There were eight drawings showing The Masked Mutant transform himself. 
And then came a big, full-page drawing showing the enormous octopus reaching 
out its slimy, fat tentacles to grab the helpless SpongeLife. 

SpongeLife struggled to pull away. 

But the octopus tentacles slid closer. Closer. 

I started to turn the page. But before I could move, I felt something cold 
and slimy wrap itself around my neck. 



3 


I let out a gasp and tried to struggle free. 

But the cold tentacles wrapped themselves tighter around my throat. 

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream. 

I heard laughter. 

With a great effort, I turned around. And saw Mitzi, my nine-year-old sister. 
She pulled her hands away from my neck and jumped back as I glared at her. 
“Why are your hands so cold?” I demanded. 

She smiled at me with her innocent, two-dimpled smile. “I put them in the 
refrigerator.” 

“You what ?! ” I cried. “You put them in the refrigerator? Why?” 

“So they’d be cold,” she replied, still grinning. 

My sister has a really dumb sense of humor. She has straight, dark brown 
hair like me. And she’s short and a little chubby like me. 

“You scared me to death,” I told her, sitting up on the bed. 

“I know,” she replied. She rubbed her hands on my cheeks. They were still 

cold. 

“Yuck. Get away, Mitzi.” I shoved her back. “Why did you come up here? 
Just to scare me?” 

She shook her head. “Dad told me to come up. He said to tell you if you’re 
reading comic books instead of doing your homework, you’re in big trouble.” 

She lowered her brown eyes to the comic book, open on the bed. “Guess 
you’re in big trouble, Skipper.” 

“No. Wait.” I grabbed her arm. “This is the new Masked Mutant. I have to 
read it! Tell Dad I’m doing my math, and—” 

I didn’t finish what I was saying because my dad stepped into the room. 
The ceiling light reflected in his glasses. But I could still see that he had his eyes 
on the open comic book on my bed. 

“Skipper—” he said angrily in his booming, deep voice. 

Mitzi pushed past him and ran out of the room. She liked to cause trouble. 
But she never wanted to stay around once things got really ugly. 

And I knew things were about to get ugly—because I had already been 
warned three times that week about spending too much time with my comic 



book collection. 

“Skipper, do you know why your grades are so bad?” my dad bellowed. 
“Because I’m not a very good student?” I replied. 

A mistake. Dad hates it when I answer back. 

Dad reminds me of a big bear. Not only because he growls a lot. But 
because he is big and broad. He has short, black hair and almost no forehead. 
Really. His hair starts almost right above his glasses. And he has a big, booming 
roar of a voice, like a bear’s roar. 

Well, after I answered him back, he let out an angry roar. Then he lumbered 
across the room and picked up my carton of comic books—my entire collection. 
“Sorry, Skipper, I’m tossing these all out!” he cried, and headed for the 

door. 



4 


You probably expected me to panic. To start begging and pleading for him not to 
throw away my valuable collection. 

But I didn’t say anything. I just stood beside the bed with my hands lowered 
at my sides, and waited. 

You see, Dad has done this before. Lots of times. But he doesn’t really 
mean it. 

He has a bad temper, but he’s no supervillain. Actually, I’d put him in The 
League of Good Guys most of the time. 

His main problem is that he doesn’t approve of comic books. He thinks 
they’re just trash. Even when I explain that my collection will probably be worth 
millions by the time I’m his age. 

Anyway, I stood there and waited silently. 

Dad stopped at the door and turned around. He held the carton in both 
hands. He narrowed his dark eyes at me through his black-framed glasses. 

“Are you going to get to your work?” he asked sternly. 

I nodded. “Yes, sir,” I muttered, staring at my feet. 

He lowered the carton a little. It’s really heavy, even for a big, strong guy 
like him. “And you won’t waste any more time tonight on comic books?” he 
demanded. 

“Couldn’t I just finish this new one?” I asked. I pointed to The Masked 
Mutant comic on the bed. 

Another mistake. 

He growled at me and turned to carry the carton away. 

“Okay, okay!” I cried. “Sorry. I’ll get my homework done, Dad. I promise. 
I’ll start right now.” 

He grunted and stepped back into the room. Then he dropped the carton 
back against the wall. “That’s all you think about night and day, Skipper,” he 
said quietly. “Comics, comics. It isn’t healthy. Really. It isn’t.” 

I didn’t say anything. I knew he was about to go back downstairs. 

“I don’t want to hear any more about comics,” Dad said gruffly. 
“Understand?” 


“Okay,” I murmured. “Sorry, Dad.” 



I waited to hear his heavy footsteps going down the stairs. Then I turned 
back to the new issue of The Masked Mutant. I was desperate to find out how 
SpongeLife escaped from the giant octopus. 

But I could hear Mitzi nearby. She was still upstairs. If she saw me reading 
the comic book, she’d run downstairs and tell Dad for sure. Mitzi’s hobby is 
being a snitch. 

So I opened my backpack and started pulling out my math notebook and 
my science textbook and other stuff I needed. 

I zipped through the math questions as fast as I could. I probably got most 
of the problems wrong. But it doesn’t matter. I’m not any good at math, anyway. 

Then I read the chapter on atoms and molecules in my science text. Reading 
about molecules made me think about The Masked Mutant. 

I couldn’t wait to get back to the comic book. 

I finally finished my homework a little after nine-thirty. I had to skip a few 
essay questions on the literature homework. But only the class brains answer all 
of the questions! 

I went downstairs and fixed myself a bowl of Frosted Flakes, my favorite 
late-night snack. Then I said good-night to my parents and hurried back up to my 
room, closing the door behind me, eager to get back in bed and start reading. 

Back under the ocean. SpongeLife escaped by squishing himself so small, 
he slipped out of the octopus’ tentacles. Pretty cool, I thought. 

The Masked Mutant waved his tentacles angrily and vowed he’d get 
SpongeLife another day. Then he changed his molecules back so he looked like 
himself, and flew back to his headquarters. 

His headquarters! 

I stared down at the comic book in shock. 

The secret headquarters of The Masked Mutant had never been shown 
before. Oh, sure, we’d been given glimpses of a room or two on the inside. 

But this was the first time the building had ever been shown from the 
outside. 

I brought the page up close to my face and examined it carefully. “What a 
weird place!” I exclaimed out loud. 

The headquarters building didn’t look like any building I had ever seen 
before. It certainly didn’t look like the secret hideout of the world’s worst villain. 

It kind of looked like a giant fire hydrant. A very tall fire hydrant that 
reached up to the sky. All pink stucco with a huge, green-domed roof. 



“Weird,” I repeated. 

But of course it was the perfect hiding place. Who would ever think that the 
super bad guy of all time stayed in a building that looked like an enormous pink 
fire hydrant? 

I turned the page. The Masked Mutant slipped into the building and 
disappeared into an elevator. He rode all the way to the top and stepped out into 
his private communications center. 

Waiting for him there was... a big surprise. A dark figure. We could see 
only his black silhouette. 

But I could tell instantly who it was. It was The Galloping Gazelle, leader 
of The League of Good Guys. 

How did The Gazelle get in? What was he about to do? 

To be continued next month. 

Wow. I closed the comic. My eyelids felt heavy. My eyes were too tired to 
read the tiny type on the Letters page. I decided to save it for tomorrow. 

Yawning, I carefully set the comic book down on my bed table. I fell asleep 
before my head hit the pillow. 

Two days later, a very cold, clear day, Wilson came running up to me after 
school. His blue coat was unzipped. He never zipped his coat. He didn’t like the 
way it looked when it was zipped. 

I had on a shirt, a sweater, and a heavy, quilted, down coat, zipped up to my 
chin—and I was still cold. “What’s up, Wilson?” I asked. 

His breath steamed up in front of him. “Want to come over and see my 
mbber stamp collection?” 

Was he kidding ? 

“I have to go to my orthodontist,” I told him. “My braces got comfortable. 
He has to tighten them so they’ll hurt again.” 

Wilson nodded. His blue eyes matched his coat. “How are you getting 
there?” 

I pointed to the bus stop. “City bus,” I told him. 

“I’ve seen you take that bus a lot,” he said. 

“There’s a comic book store on Goodale Street,” I replied, shifting my 
backpack onto the other shoulder. “I take the bus there once a week or so to see 
what new comics have come out. The orthodontist is just a few blocks from it.” 

“Do they have rubber stamps at the comic book store?” Wilson asked. 



“I don’t think so,” I told him. I saw the blue-and-white city bus turn the 
corner. “Got to run. See you later!” I called. 

I turned and ran full speed to the bus stop. 

The driver was a nice guy. He saw me running and waited for me. 
Breathing hard, I thanked him and climbed on to the bus. 

I probably wouldn’t have thanked him if I had known where this bus was 
going to take me. But I didn’t know that it was carrying me to the most 
frightening adventure of my life. 



5 


The bus was unusually crowded. I stood for a while. Then two people got off, 
and I slid into a seat. 

As the bus bounced along Main Street, I stared out at the passing houses 
and front yards. Dark clouds hung low over the roofs. I wondered if we were 
about to get our first snowfall of the winter. 

The comic book store was a few blocks away. I checked my watch, thinking 
maybe I had time to stop there before my orthodontist appointment. But no. No 
time for comics today. 

“Hey, do you go to Franklin?” A girl’s voice interrupted my thoughts. 

I turned to see that a girl had taken the seat beside me. Her carrot-colored 
hair was tied back in a single braid. She had green eyes and light freckles on her 
nose. 

She wore a heavy, blue-and-red-plaid ski sweater over faded jeans. She held 
her red canvas backpack in her lap. 

“Yeah. I go there,” I replied. 

“How is it?” she asked. She narrowed her green eyes at me as if checking 
me out. 

“It’s okay,” I told her. 

“What’s your name?” she asked. 

“Skipper,” I told her. 

She snickered. “That’s not a real name, is it?” 

“It’s what everyone calls me,” I said. 

“Do you live on a boat or something?” she asked. Her eyes crinkled up. I 
could see she was laughing at me. 

I guess Skipper is kind of a dumb name. But I’ve gotten used to it. I like it a 
lot better than my real name—Bradley. 

“When I was a little kid, I was always in a hurry,” I told her. “So I used to 
skip a lot. That’s why they started calling me Skipper.” 

“Cute,” she replied with a smirk. 

I don’t think I like this girl, I told myself. “What’s your name?” I asked her. 

“Skipper,” she replied, grinning. “Same as yours.” 

“No. Really,” I insisted. 



“It’s Libby,” she said finally. “Libby Zacks.” She stared past me out the 
window. The bus stopped for a red light. A baby started crying in the back. 

“Where are you going?” Libby asked me. “Home?” 

I didn’t want to tell her I had an orthodontist appointment. That was too 
geeky. “I’m going to a comic book store,” I said. “The one on Goodale.” 

“You collect comics?” She sounded surprised. “So do I.” 

It was my turn to be surprised. Most of the comic book collectors I know 
are boys. “What kind do you collect?” I asked. 

“High School Harry & Beanhead,” she replied. “I collect all the digest¬ 
sized ones and some of the regular ones, too.” 

“Yuck.” I made a face. “High School Harry and his pal Beanhead? Those 
comics stink.” 

“They do not!” Libby insisted. 

“Those are for babies,” I muttered. “They’re not real comics.” 

“They’re very well written,” Libby replied. “And they’re funny.” She stuck 
her tongue out at me. “Maybe you just don’t get them.” 

“Yeah. Maybe,” I said, rolling my eyes. 

I gazed out the window. The sky had grown darker. I didn’t recognize any 
of the stores. I saw a restaurant called Pearl’s and a tiny barbershop. Had we 
passed the comic book store? 

Libby folded her hands over her red backpack. “What do you collect? All 
that superhero junk?” 

“Yeah,” I told her. “My collection is worth about a thousand dollars. Maybe 
two thousand.” 

“In your dreams,” she shot back. She laughed. 

“High School Harry comics never go up in value,” I informed her. “Even 
the Number Ones are worthless. You couldn’t get five dollars for your whole 
collection.” 

“Why would I want to sell them?” she argued. “I don’t want to sell them. 
And I don’t care what they’re worth. I just like to read them.” 

“Then you’re not a real collector,” I said. 

“Are all the boys at Franklin like you?” Libby asked. 

“No. I’m the coolest one,” I declared. 

We both laughed. 

I still couldn’t decide if I liked her or not. She was pretty cute-looking. And 
she was funny, in a nasty sort of way. 



I stopped laughing when I glanced out the window and realized I had 
definitely passed my stop. I saw the bare trees of a small park I’d never seen 
before. The bus rumbled past it, and more unfamiliar stores came into view. 

I felt a sudden stab of panic in my chest. I didn’t know this neighborhood at 
all. 

I pushed the bell and jumped to my feet. 

“What’s your problem?” Libby demanded. 

“My stop. I m-missed it,” I stammered. 

She moved her legs into the aisle so that I could squeeze past. The bus 
squealed to a stop. I called out good-bye and hurried out the back door. 

Where am I? I asked myself, glancing around. Why did I let myself get into 
an argument with that girl? Why didn’t I pay attention instead? 

“Are you lost?” a voice asked. 

I turned and saw to my surprise that Libby had followed me off the bus. 
“What are you doing here?” I blurted out. 

“It’s my stop,” she replied. “I live two blocks down that way.” She pointed. 

“I have to go back,” I said, turning to leave. 

And as I turned, something came into view that made my breath catch in 
my throat. 

“Ohh.” I let out a startled cry and stared across the street. “But—that’s 
impossible !” I exclaimed. 

I was staring at a tall building on the other corner. A tall, pink stucco 
building with a bright green, domed roof. 

I was staring at the secret headquarters of The Masked Mutant. 



6 


“Skipper—what’s wrong?” Libby cried. 

I couldn’t answer her. I stared goggle-eyed at the building across the street. 
My mouth dropped open. My jaw nearly hit my knees! 

I raised my eyes to the bright green roof. Then I slowly lowered them over 
the shiny pink walls. I had never seen colors like these in real life. They were 
comic book colors. 

It was a comic book building. 

But here it was, standing on the corner across the street. 

“Skipper? Are you okay?” Libby’s voice sounded far away. 

It’s real! I told myself. The secret headquarters building of The Masked 
Mutant is real! 

Or is it? 

Two hands shook me by the shoulders, snapping me out of my amazed 
thoughts. “Skipper! Are you in shock or something?” 

“Th-that building!” I stammered. 

“Isn’t that the ugliest thing you ever saw?” Libby asked, shaking her head. 
She pushed back her carrot-colored braid and hiked her backpack onto her 
shoulder. 

“But it—it’s—” I still couldn’t speak. 

“My dad says the architect had to be color blind,” Libby said. “It doesn’t 
even look like a building. It looks like a blimp standing on its end.” 

“How long has it been there?” I asked, my eyes studying the glass doors 
that were the only entrance. 

Libby shrugged. “I don’t know. My family just moved here last spring. It 
was already here.” 

The clouds darkened overhead. A cold wind swirled around the corner. 

“Who do you think works in there?” Libby asked. “There’s no sign or 
anything on the building.” 

Of course there’s no sign, I thought. It’s the secret headquarters of the 
world’s most evil villain. There’s no way The Masked Mutant would put a sign 
out front! 

He doesn’t want The League of Good Guys to find his secret headquarters, 



I told myself. 

“This is crazy!” I cried. 

I turned and saw Libby staring at me. “You sure you’re okay? It’s just a 
building, Skipper. No need to go ballistic.” 

I could feel my face turning red. Libby must think I’m some kind of a nut, I 
realized. “I—I think I saw this building somewhere,” I tried to explain. 

“I’ve got to get home,” she said, glancing up at the darkening sky. “Want to 
come over? I’ll show you my comic book collection.” 

“No. I’m late for my orthodontist appointment,” I replied. 

“Huh?” She narrowed her green eyes at me. “You said you were going to a 
comic book store.” 

I could feel my face turning even redder. “Uh... I’m going to the comic 
book store after my appointment,” I told her. 

“How long have you had your braces?” she asked. 

I groaned. “Forever.” 

She started backing away. “Well, see you sometime.” 

“Yeah. Bye.” 

She turned and jogged down the street. She must think I’m a total geek, I 
thought unhappily. 

But I couldn’t help it. I really was in shock, seeing that building. I turned 
back to it. The top of the building had become hidden by the lowering clouds. 
Now the building looked like a sleek, pink rocket ship, reaching up to the clouds. 

A moving truck rumbled past. I waited for it to go by, then hurried across 
the street. 

There was no one on the sidewalk. I hadn’t seen anyone go into the building 
or come out of it. 

It’s just a big office building, I told myself. Nothing to get excited about. 

But my heart was pounding as I stopped a few feet from the glass doors at 
the entrance. I took a deep breath and peeked in. 

I know it’s crazy, but I really expected to see people wearing superhero 
costumes walking around in there. 

I narrowed my eyes and squinted through the glass doors. 

I couldn’t see anyone. It appeared dark inside. 

I took a step closer. Then another. 

I brought my face right up to the glass and peered in. I could see a wide 
lobby. Pink-and-yellow walls. A row of elevators near the back. 



But no people. No one. Empty. 

I grabbed the glass-door handle. My throat made a loud gulping sound as I 
swallowed hard. 


Should I go in? I asked myself. Do I dare? 



7 


My hand tightened on the glass-door handle. I started to tug the heavy door 
open. 

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a blue-and-white bus moving 
toward me. I glanced at my watch. I was only five minutes late for my 
appointment. If I jumped on the bus, I could be at the orthodontist’s office in a 
few minutes. 

Letting go of the handle, I turned and ran to the bus stop, my backpack 
bouncing on my shoulders. I felt disappointed. But I also felt relieved. 

Walking into the headquarters of the meanest mutant in the universe was a 
little scary. 

The bus eased to a stop. I waited for an elderly man to step off. Then I 
climbed onboard, dropped my money into the box, and hurried to the back of the 
bus. 

I wanted to get one last look at the mysterious pink-and-green building. 

Two women were sitting in the back seat. But I pushed between them and 
pressed my face against the back window. 

As the bus pulled away, I stared at the building. Its colors stayed bright, 
even though the sky was so dark behind it. The sidewalk was empty. I still hadn’t 
seen anyone come out or go inside. 

A few seconds later, the building disappeared into the distance. I turned 
away from the window and walked up the aisle to find a seat. 

Weird, I thought. Totally weird. 

“And it was the exact same building as in the comic book?” Wilson asked. His 
blue eyes stared across the lunchroom table at me. 

I nodded. “As soon as I got home yesterday afternoon, I checked out the 
comic book. The building was exactly the same.” 

Wilson pulled a sandwich from his lunch bag and started to unwrap the foil. 
“What kind of sandwich did your mom pack for you?” he asked. 

I opened mine. “Tuna salad. What’s yours?” 

He lifted a slice of bread and examined his sandwich. “Tuna salad,” he 
replied. “Want to trade?” 



“We both have tuna salad,” I told him. “Why do you want to trade?” 

He shrugged. “I don’t know.” 

We traded sandwiches. His mom’s tuna salad was better than mine. I pulled 
the juice box from my lunch bag. Then I tossed the apple in the trash. I keep 
telling Mom not to pack an apple. I told her I just throw it away every day. Why 
does she keep packing one? 

“Can I have your pudding container?” I asked Wilson. 

“No,” he replied. 

I finished the first half of the sandwich. I was thinking hard about the 
mysterious building. I’d been thinking about it ever since I saw it. 

“I’ve solved the mystery,” Wilson said. He scratched his white-blond curls. 
A smile formed on his face. “Yes! I’ve solved it!” 

“What?” I demanded eagerly. 

“It’s simple,” Wilson replied. “Who draws The Masked Mutant?” 

“The artist?” I asked. “Jimmy Starenko, of course. Starenko created The 
Masked Mutant and The League of Good Guys.” How could Wilson not know 
that? 

“Well, I’ll bet this guy Starenko was here one day,” Wilson continued, 
jabbing the straw into the top of his juice box. 

“Starenko? Here? In Riverview Falls?” I said. I wasn’t following him. 

Wilson nodded. “Let’s say Starenko is here. He’s driving down the street, 
and he sees the weird building. He stops his car. He gets out. He stares at the 
building. And he thinks: What a great building! This building would make a 
perfect secret headquarters building for The Masked Mutant.” 

“Wow. I see,” I murmured. I was catching on to Wilson’s thinking. “You 
mean, he saw the building, liked it, and copied it when he drew the headquarters 
building.” 

Wilson nodded. He had a piece of celery stuck to his front tooth. “Yeah. 
Maybe he got out of the car and sketched the building. Then he kept the sketches 
in a drawer or something till he needed them.” 

It made sense. 

Actually, it made too much sense. I felt really disappointed. I knew it was 
silly, but I really wanted that building to be The Masked Mutant’s secret 
headquarters. 

Wilson had spoiled everything. Why did he have to be so sensible for once? 

“I got some new rubber stamps,” he told me, finishing the last spoonful 



from his pudding container. “Want to see them? I could bring them over to your 
house after school.” 

“No thanks,” I replied. “That would be too exciting.” 

I planned to take the bus and go see the building again that afternoon. But Ms. 
Partridge gave us a ton of homework. I had to go straight home. 

The next day, it snowed. Wilson and I and some other guys went sledding 
on Grover’s Hill. 

A week later, I finally had a chance to go back and take another look at the 
building. This time, I’m going inside, I told myself. There must be a receptionist 
or a guard, I decided. I’ll ask whose building it is and who works there. 

I was feeling really brave as I climbed on to the bus after school. It was an 
ordinary office building, after all. Nothing to get excited about. Taking a seat at 
the front of the bus, I looked for Libby. The bus was filled with kids going home 
after school. Near the back, I saw a red-haired girl arguing with another girl. But 
it wasn’t Libby. 

No sign of her. 

I stared out the window as the bus rolled past the comic book store. Then, a 
few blocks later, we bounced past my orthodontist’s office. Just seeing his 
building made my teeth ache! 

It was a sunny, clear afternoon. Bright sunlight kept filling the bus 
windows, forcing me to shield my eyes as I stared out. 

I had to keep careful watch, because I wasn’t sure where the stop was. I 
really didn’t know this neighborhood at all. 

Kids were jammed in the aisle. So I couldn’t see out the windows on the 
other side of the bus. 

I hope we haven’t already passed the building, I thought. I had a heavy 
feeling in the pit of my stomach. I have a real fear of getting lost. 

My mom says that when I was two, she lost me for a few minutes in the 
frozen foods section at the Pic ’n Pay. I think I’ve had a fear of getting lost ever 
since. 

The bus pulled up to a bus stop. I recognized the small park across the 
street. This was the stop! 

“Getting off!” I shouted, jumping into the aisle. I hit a boy with my 
backpack as I stumbled to the front door. “Sorry. Getting off! Getting off!” 

I pushed through the crowd of kids and leaped down the steps, onto the 



curb. The bus rumbled away. Sunlight streamed around me. 

I stepped to the corner. Yes. This was the right stop. I recognized it all now. 
I turned and raised my eyes to the strange building. 

And found myself staring at a large, empty lot. 

The building was gone. 



8 


“Whoa!” I cried, frozen in shock. 

Shielding my eyes with one hand, I stared across the street. How could that 
enormous building vanish in one week? 

I didn’t have long to think about it. Another bus pulled up to the bus stop. 
“Skipper! Hey—Skipper!” Libby hopped off the bus, waving and calling my 
name. 

She was wearing the same red-and-blue ski sweater and faded jeans, torn at 
one knee. Her hair was pulled straight back, tied in a ponytail with a blue hair 
scrunchie. 

“Hey—what are you doing back in my neighborhood?” she asked, smiling 
as she ran over to me. 

“Th-that building!” I stammered, pointing to the vacant lot. “It’s gone!” 

Libby’s expression changed. “Well, don’t say hi or anything,” she muttered, 
frowning at me. 

“Hi,” I said. “What happened to that building?” 

She turned and followed my stare. Then she shrugged. “Guess they tore it 
down.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

“It was so ugly,” Libby said. “Maybe the city made them tear it down.” 

“But did you see them tear it down?” I demanded impatiently. “You live 
near here, right? Did you see them doing it?” 

She thought about it, crinkling her green eyes as she thought. “Well... no,” 
she replied finally. “I’ve gone past here a few times, but—” 

“You didn’t see any machinery?” I demanded anxiously. “Any big wrecking 
balls? Any bulldozers? Dozens of workers?” 

Libby shook her head. “No. I didn’t actually see anyone tearing the building 
down. But I didn’t really look.” 

She pulled her red backpack off her shoulder and held the strap in front of 
her with both hands. “I don’t know why you’re so interested in that ugly 
building, Skipper. I’m glad it’s gone.” 

“But it was in a comic book!” I blurted out. 

“Huh?” She stared hard at me. “What are you talking about?” 



I knew she wouldn’t understand. “Nothing,” I muttered. 

“Skipper, did you come all the way out here just to see that building?” she 
asked. 

“No way,” I lied. “Of course not.” 

“Do you want to come to my house and see my comic book collection?” 

I was so frazzled and mixed up, I said yes. 

I hurried out of Libby’s house less than an hour later. Those High School Harry 
& Beanhead comics are the most boring comics in the world! And the art is so 
lame. Can’t everyone see that the two girls are drawn exactly the same, except 
one has blond hair and one has black? 

Yuck! 

Libby insisted on showing me every High School Harry & Beanhead comic 
she had. And she had shelves full of them! 

Of course I couldn’t concentrate on those boring comics. I couldn’t stop 
thinking about the weird building. How could a whole building vanish without a 
trace? 

I jogged back to the bus stop on Main Street. The sun was sinking behind 
the buildings. Long blue shadows tilted over the sidewalks. 

When I get to the corner, I bet the building will be back! I found myself 
thinking. 

But of course it wasn’t. 

I know. I know. I have weird thoughts. I guess it comes from reading too 
many comic books. 

I had to wait nearly half an hour for the bus to come. I spent the whole time 
staring at the empty lot, thinking about the vanished building. 

When I finally got home, I found a brown envelope waiting for me on the 
little table in the hall where Mom drops the mail. 

“Yes!” I exclaimed happily. The special issue of The Masked Mutant ! The 
comics company was sending out two special editions this month, and this was 
the first. 

I called “hi” to my mom, tossed my coat and heavy backpack onto the floor, 
and raced up the stairs to my room, the comic book gripped tightly in my hot 
little hand. 

I couldn’t wait to see what had happened after The Galloping Gazelle 
sneaked into The Masked Mutant’s headquarters. Carefully, I slid the comic 



book out of the envelope and examined the cover. 

And there it stood. The pink-and-green headquarters building. Right on the 
cover. 

My hand trembled as I opened to the first page. MORNING OF A MUTANT 
was the big title in scary red letters. The Masked Mutant stood in front of a big 
communications console. 

He stared into a wall of about twenty TV monitors. Each TV monitor 
showed a different member of The League of Good Guys. 

“I’m tracking each one of them,” The Masked Mutant said in the first 
dialogue balloon. “They’ll never find me. I’ve thrown an Invisibility Curtain 
around my entire headquarters!” 

My mouth dropped open as I read those words. 

I read them three times before I let the comic book slip out of my hands to 
my bed. 

An Invisibility Curtain. 

No one can see The Masked Mutant’s building because he slipped an 
Invisibility Curtain around it. 

I sat excitedly on the edge of my bed, breathing hard, feeling the blood 
pulse at my temples. 

Is that what happened in real life? 

Is that why I couldn’t see the pink-and-green building this afternoon? 

Was the comic book giving me the answer to the mystery of the missing 
building? 

It sounded crazy. It sounded totally crazy. 

But was it real? Was there really an Invisibility Curtain hiding the building? 

My head was spinning faster than The Amazing Tornado-Man! I knew only 
one thing. I had to go back there and find out.

After school the next afternoon, I had to go with my mom to the mall to buy 
sneakers. I usually try on at least ten or twelve pairs, then beg for the most 
expensive ones. You know. The ones that pump up or flash lights when you walk 
in them. 

But this time I bought the first pair I saw, plain black-and-white Reeboks. I 
mean, who could think about sneakers when an invisible building was waiting to 
be discovered? 

Driving home from the mall, I started to tell Mom about the building. But 
she stopped me after a few sentences. “I wish you were as interested in your 
schoolwork as you are in those dumb comics,” she said, sighing. 

That’s what she always says. 

“When is the last time you read a good book?” she continued. 

That’s the next thing she always says. 

I decided to change the subject. “We dissected a worm today for science,” I 
told her. 

She made a disgusted face. “Doesn’t your teacher have anything better to 
do than to cut up poor, innocent worms?” 

There was just no pleasing Mom today. 

The next afternoon, wearing my new sneakers, I eagerly hopped on the city bus. 
Tossing my token into the box, I saw Libby sitting near the back. As the bus 
lurched away from the curb, I stumbled down the aisle and dropped beside her, 
lowering my backpack to the floor. 

“I’m going back to that building,” I said breathlessly. “I think there’s an 
Invisibility Curtain around it.” 

“Don’t you ever say hi?” she complained, rolling her eyes. 

I said hi. Then I repeated what I had said about the Invisibility Curtain. I 
told her I read about it in the newest Masked Mutant comic, and that the comic 
may be giving clues as to what was happening in real life. 

Libby listened to me intently, not blinking, not moving. I could see that she 
was finally starting to see why I was so excited about finding this building. 

When I finished explaining everything, she put a hand on my forehead. 



“You don’t feel hot,” she said. “Are you seeing a shrink?” 

“Huh?” I pushed her hand away. 

“Are you seeing a shrink? You’re totally out of your mind. You know that 
—don’t you?” 

“I’m not crazy,” I said. “I’ll prove it. Come with me.” 

She edged closer to the window, as if trying to get away from me. “No 
way,” she declared. “I can’t believe I’m sitting here with a boy who thinks that 
comic books come to life.” 

She pointed out the window. “Hey, look, Skipper—there goes the Easter 
Bunny! He’s handing an egg to the Tooth Fairy!” She laughed. A mean laugh. 

“Ha-ha,” I muttered angrily. I have a good sense of humor. But I don’t like 
being laughed at by girls who collect High School Harry & Beanhead comics. 

The bus pulled up to the bus stop. I hoisted my backpack and scrambled out 
the back exit. Libby stepped off right behind me. 

As the bus pulled away, sending out puffs of black exhaust behind it, I 
gazed across the street. 

No building. An empty lot. 

“Well?” I turned to Libby. “You coming?” 

She twisted her mouth into a thoughtful expression. “To that empty lot? 
Skipper, aren’t you going to feel like a jerk when there’s nothing there?” 

“Well, go home then,” I told her sharply. 

“Okay. I’ll come,” she said, grinning. 

We crossed the street. Two teenagers on bikes nearly ran us over. “Missed 
’em!” one of them cried. The other one laughed. 

“How do we get through the Invisibility Curtain?” Libby asked. Her voice 
sounded serious. But I could see by her eyes that she was laughing at me. 

“In the comic book, people just stepped through it,” I told her. “You can’t 
feel it or anything. It’s like a smoke screen. But once you step through it, you 
can see the building.” 

“Okay. Let’s try it,” Libby said. She tossed her ponytail over her shoulder. 
“Let’s get this over with, okay?” 

Walking side by side, we took a step across the sidewalk toward the empty 
lot. Then another step. Then another. 

We crossed the sidewalk and stepped onto the hard dirt. 

“I can’t believe I’m doing this,” Libby grumbled. We took another step. “I 
can’t believe I’m—” 



She stopped because the building popped into view. 

“Ohhh!” We both cried out in unison. She grabbed my wrist and squeezed it 
hard. Her hand was ice-cold. 

We stood a few feet from the glass entrance. The bright walls of the pink- 
and-green building rose above us. 

“You—you were right!” Libby stammered, still squeezing my wrist. 

I swallowed hard. I tried to talk, but my mouth was suddenly too dry. I 
coughed, and no words came out. 

“Now what?” Libby asked, staring up at the shiny walls. 

I still couldn’t speak. 

The comic book is real\ I thought. The comic book is real. 

Does that mean the building really belongs to The Masked Mutant? 

Whoa! I warned myself to slow down. My heart was already racing faster 
than Speedboy. 

“Now what?” Libby repeated impatiently. “Let’s get away from here— 
okay?” For the first time, she sounded really frightened. 

“No way!” I told her. “Come on. Let’s go in.” 

She tugged me back. “Go in? Are you crazy?” 

“We have to,” I told her. “Come on. Don’t stop to think about it. Let’s go.” 

I took a deep breath, pulled open the heavy glass door, and we slipped 
inside. 



10 


We took one step into the brightly lit lobby. My heart was pounding so hard, my 
chest hurt. My knees were shaking. I’d never been so scared in my life! 

I glanced quickly all around. 

The lobby was enormous. It seemed to stretch on forever. The pink-and- 
yellow walls gave off a soft glow. The sparkly white ceiling seemed to be a mile 
above our heads. 

I didn’t see a reception desk. No chairs or tables. No furniture of any kind. 

“Where is everyone?” Libby whispered. I could see that she was frightened, 
too. She clung to my arm, standing close beside me. 

The vast room was empty. Not another person in sight. 

I took another step. 

And heard a soft beep. 

A beam of yellow light shot out of the wall and rolled down over my body. 

I felt a gentle tingling. Kind of a prickly feeling, the kind of feeling when 
your arm goes to sleep. 

It swept down quickly from my head to my feet. A second or two later, the 
light vanished and the tingly feeling went away. 

“What was that?” I whispered to Libby. 

“What was what?” she replied. 

“Didn’t you feel that?” 

She shook her head. “I didn’t feel anything. Are you trying to scare me or 
something, Skipper?” 

“It was some kind of electric beam,” I told her. “It shined on me when I 
stepped forward.” 

“Let’s get out of here,” she muttered. “It’s so quiet, it’s creepy.” 

I turned my eyes to the row of elevators against the yellow wall. Did I dare 
take a ride on one? Was I brave enough to do a little exploring? 

“It—it’s just a big office building,” I told Libby, trying to work up my 
courage. 

“Well, if it’s an office building, where are the workers?” she demanded. 

“Maybe the offices are closed,” I suggested. 



“On a Thursday?” Libby replied. “It isn’t a holiday or anything. I think the 
building is empty, Skipper. I don’t think anyone works here.” 

I took a few steps toward the elevators. My sneakers thudded loudly on the 
hard marble floor. “But all the lights are on, Libby,” I said. “And the door was 
open.” 

She hurried to catch up to me. Her eyes kept darting back and forth. I could 
see she was really scared. 

“I know what you’re thinking,” she said. “You don’t think this is just an 
office building. You think this is the secret headquarters of that comic book 
character—don’t you, Skipper?!” 

I swallowed hard. My knees were still shaking. I tried to make them stop, 
but they wouldn’t. 

“Well, maybe it is,” I replied, staring at the elevators across from us. “I 
mean, how do you explain the Invisibility Curtain? It was in the comic book— 
and it was outside this building.” 

“I—I can’t explain it,” Libby stammered. “It’s weird. It’s too weird. This 
place gives me the creeps, Skipper. I really think—” 

“There’s only one way to find out the truth,” I said. I tried to sound brave, 
but my voice shook nearly as much as my knees! 

Libby followed my gaze to the elevators. She guessed what I was thinking. 
“No way!” she cried, stepping back toward the glass doors. 

“We’ll just ride up and down,” I told her. “Maybe open the elevator doors 
on a few floors and peek out.” 

“No way,” Libby repeated. Her face suddenly appeared very pale. Her 
green eyes were wide with fright. 

“Libby, it will only take a minute,” I insisted. “We’ve come this far. I have 
to explore a little. I don’t want to go home without finding out what this building 
is.” 

“You can ride the elevators,” she said. “I’m going home.” She backed up to 
the glass doors. 

Outside I saw a blue-and-white bus stop at the curb. A woman climbed off, 
carrying a baby in one hand, dragging a stroller in the other. 

I could run out the door and climb right onto that bus, I thought. I could get 
out of here, safe and sound. And be on my way home. 

But what would happen when I got home? 

I would feel like a coward, a total wimp. And I would spend day after day 



wondering about this building, wondering if I had actually discovered the secret 
headquarters of a real supervillain. 

If I jumped on the bus and rode home now, the building would still be a 
mystery. And the mystery would drive me crazy. 

“Okay, Libby, you can go home if you want,” I told her. “I’m going to ride 
the elevator to the top and back.” 

She stared at me thoughtfully. Then she rolled her eyes. “Okay, okay. Til 
come with you,” she murmured, shaking her head. 

I was glad. I really didn’t want to go alone. 

“I’m only doing this because I feel sorry for you,” Libby said, following me 
across the marble floor to the elevators. 

“Huh? Why do you feel sorry for me?” I demanded. 

“Because you’re so messed up,” she replied. “You really think a comic 
book can come to life. That’s sad. That’s really sad.” 

“Thank goodness High School Harry and Beanhead can’t come to life!” I 
teased. Then I added, “What about the Invisibility Curtain? That was real— 
wasn’t it?” 

Libby didn’t reply. Instead, she laughed. “You’re serious about this!” she 
said. The sound of her laughter echoed in the enormous, empty lobby. 

It made me feel a little braver. I laughed, too. 

What’s the big deal? I asked myself. So you’re going to take an elevator 
ride. So what? 

It’s not like The Masked Mutant is going to jump into the elevator with us, I 
assured myself. We’ll probably peek out at a lot of boring offices. And that’s all. 

I pushed the lighted button on the wall. Instantly, the silvery elevator door 
in front of us slid open. 

I poked my head into the elevator. It had walls of dark brown wood with a 
silver railing that went all the way around. 

There were no signs on the walls. No building directory. No words at all. 

I suddenly realized there were no signs in the lobby, either. Not even a sign 
with the name of the building. Or a sign to tell visitors where to check in. 

Weird. 

“Let’s go,” I said. 

Libby held back. I tugged her by the arm into the elevator. 

The doors slid shut silently behind us as soon as we stepped in. I turned to 
the control panel to the left of the door. It was a long, silvery rectangle filled 



with buttons. 

I pushed the button to the top floor. 

The elevator started to hum. It jerked slightly as we began to move. 

I turned to Libby. She had her back pressed against the back wall, her hands 
shoved into her jeans pockets. She stared straight ahead at the door. 

“We’re moving,” I murmured. 

The elevator picked up speed. 

“Hey!” Libby and I both cried out at the same time. 

“We—we’re going down!” I exclaimed. 

I had pushed the button to the top floor. But we were dropping. Fast. 

Faster. 

I grabbed the railing with both hands. 

Where was it taking us? 

Would it ever stop? 



11 


The elevator stopped with a hard thud that made my knees bend. “Whoa!” I 
cried. 

I let go of the railing and turned to Libby beside me. “You okay?” 

She nodded. She stared straight ahead at the elevator door. 

“We should have gone up,” I muttered tensely. “I pushed up.” 

“Why doesn’t the door open?” Libby asked in a trembling voice. 

We both stared at the door. I stepped to the center of the elevator. “Open!” I 
commanded it. 

The door didn’t move. 

“We’re trapped in here,” Libby said, her voice getting shrill and tiny. 

“No,” I replied, still trying to be the brave one. “It’ll open. Watch. It’s just 
slow.” 

The door didn’t open. 

“The elevator must be broken,” Libby wailed. 

“We’ll be trapped down here forever. The air is starting to run out already. I 
can’t breathe!” 

“Don’t panic,” I warned, struggling to keep my voice calm. “Take a deep 
breath, Libby. There’s plenty of air.” 

She obediently sucked in a deep breath. She let it out in a long whoosh. 
“Why won’t the door open? I knew we shouldn’t have done this!” 

I turned to the control panel. A button at the bottom read OPEN. I pushed it. 
Instantly, the door slid open. 

I turned back to Libby. “See? We’re okay.” 

“But where are we?” she cried. 

I stepped to the doorway and poked my head out. It was very dark. I could 
see some kind of heavy machinery in the darkness. 

“We’re in the basement, I think,” I told Libby. “There are all kinds of pipes 
and a big furnace and things.” 

“Let’s go,” Libby urged, hanging back against the elevator wall. 

I took a step out the door and glanced both ways. I couldn’t see much. More 
machinery. A row of metal trash cans. A stack of long metal boxes. 



“Come on, Skipper,” Libby demanded. “Let’s go back up. Now!” 

I stepped back into the elevator and pushed the button marked LOBBY. 

The door didn’t close. The elevator didn’t move, didn’t hum. 

I pushed LOBBY again. I pushed it five or six times. 

Nothing happened. 

I suddenly had a lump in my throat as big as a watermelon. I really didn’t 
want to be stuck down in this dark basement. 

I started pushing buttons wildly. I pushed everything. I pushed a red button 
marked EMERGENCY five or six times. 

Nothing. 

“I don’t believe this!” I choked out. 

“Let’s get out and take a different elevator,” Libby suggested. 

Good idea, I thought. There was a long row of elevators up in the lobby. 
We’ll just get out of this one and push the button for another one to come down 
and get us. 

I led the way out into the dark basement. Libby stayed close behind me. 

“Oh!” We both let out low cries as the elevator door quickly slid shut 
behind us. 

“What’s going on?” I demanded. “Why wouldn’t it close before?” 

Libby didn’t reply. 

I waited for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. Then I saw what Libby was 
staring at. 

“Where are the other elevators?” she cried. 

We were staring at a smooth, bare wall. The elevator that had brought us 
down here was the only elevator on the wall. 

I spun around, checking out the other walls. But it was too dark to see very 
far. 

“The other elevators don’t come down here, I guess,” Libby murmured in a 
trembling voice. 

I searched the wall for a button to push to bring our elevator back. I 
couldn’t find one. No button. 

“There’s no way out!” Libby wailed. “No way out at all!” 



12 


“Maybe there are elevators on the other wall,” I said, pointing across the huge, 
dark room. 

“Maybe,” Libby repeated doubtfully. 

“Maybe there’s a stairway or something,” I said. 

“Maybe,” she said softly. 

A sudden noise made me jump. A rumble followed by a grinding hum. 

“Just the furnace starting up,” I told Libby. 

“Let’s find a way out of here,” she urged. “I’m never going in an elevator 
again as long as I live!” 

I could feel her hand on my shoulder as I started to make my way through 
the darkness. The huge, gray furnace rumbled and coughed. Another big 
machine made a soft clattering sound as we edged past it. 

“Anybody down here?” I called. My voice echoed off the long, dust- 
covered pipes that ran along the low ceiling above our heads. I cupped my hands 
around my mouth and called again. “Anybody here? Can anybody hear me?” 

Silence. 

The only sounds I could hear were the rumble of the furnace and the soft 
scrape of our sneakers as Libby and I slowly crept over the floor. 

As we came near the far wall, we could see that there were no elevators 
over here. The smooth plaster wall was bare except for a thick tangle of cobwebs 
up near the ceiling. 

“There’s got to be some stairs leading out of here,” Libby whispered, close 
behind me. 

Dim light shone through a narrow doorway up ahead. “Let’s see where this 
leads,” I said, brushing stringy spiderwebs off my face. 

We stepped through the doorway and found ourselves in a long hallway. 
Dust-covered ceiling bulbs cast pale light onto the concrete floor. 

“Anybody here?” I called again. My voice sounded hollow in the long 
tunnel of a hallway. 

No reply. 

Dark doorways lined both sides of the hallway. I peeked into each door as 
we passed. I saw stacks of cartons, tall file cabinets, strange machinery I didn’t 



recognize. One large room was jammed with enormous coils of metal cable. 
Another room had sheets of metal piled nearly to the ceiling. 

“Helloooooo!” I called. “Helllooooooo!” 

No reply. 

Flashing red lights inside a large room caught my eye. I stopped at the 
doorway and stared in at some sort of control panel. 

One wall was filled with blinking red and green lights. In front of the lights 
stood a long counter of dials and gears and levers. Three tall stools were placed 
along the counter. But no one sat in them. 

No one worked the controls. The room was empty. As empty as the rest of 
this strange, frightening basement. 

“Weird, huh?” I whispered to Libby. 

When she didn’t answer, I turned to make sure she was okay. 

“Libby?” 

She was gone. 



13 


I spun around. “Libby?” 

My entire body shook. 

“Where are you?” 

I squinted back down the long, gray hallway. No sign of her. 

“Libby? If this is some kind of a dumb joke...” I started. But the rest of my 
words caught in my throat. 

Breathing hard, I forced myself to retrace our steps. “Libby?” I stopped at 
every door and called her name. “Libby?” 

The hallway curved, and I followed it. I began jogging, my hands down 
stiffly at my sides, calling her name, searching every door, peering into every 
dark room. 

How could she get lost? I asked myself, feeling my panic rise until I could 
barely breathe. She was right behind me. 

I turned another corner. Into a hallway I hadn’t explored yet. “Libby?” 

The narrow hall led to an enormous, brightly lit room. I had to shut my eyes 
against the sudden bright light. 

When I opened them, I found myself nearly face-to-face with a gigantic 
machine. Bright floodlights from the high ceiling covered it in light. 

The machine had to be a block long! A big control panel, filled with dials, 
and buttons, and lights, stood against the side. A long, flat part—like a conveyor 
belt—led to several rollers. And at the very end of the machine stood a huge 
white wheel. No—a cylinder. No—a roll of white paper. 

It’s a printing press! I realized. 

I lurched into the room, stepping around stacks of paper and cardboard 
cartons. The floor was littered with paper, ink-smeared paper, crumpled, folded, 
and ripped. 

As I staggered toward the huge printing press, the sea of paper rose up 
nearly to my knees! 

“Libby? Are you in here? Libby?” 

Silence. 

This room was as empty as all the others. 

The paper crackled under my sneakers. I made my way to a long table at the 



back of the room. I found a red stool in front of the table, and I dropped down 
onto it. 

I kicked big sheets of paper away from my legs and glanced around the 
room. A hundred questions pushed into my mind at once. 

Where is Libby? How could she disappear like that? 

Is she somewhere close behind me? Will she follow the hallway to this big 
room? 

Where is everyone? Why is this place totally deserted? 

Is this where they print the comic books? Am I in the basement of 
Collectable Comics, the company that publishes The Masked Mutant ? 

Questions, questions. 

My brain felt about to burst. I stared around the cluttered room, my eyes 
rolling past the gigantic printing press, searching for Libby. 

Where was she? Where ? 

I turned back to the table—and gasped. 

I nearly toppled off the stool. The Masked Mutant was staring up at me. 



14 


A large, color drawing of The Masked Mutant stared up at me from the table. 
Startled, I picked it up and examined it. 

It had been drawn on thick posterboard in colored inks. The Masked 
Mutant’s cape swept behind him. Through his mask, his eyes appeared to stare 
out at me. Evil, angry eyes. 

The ink glistened on the page, as if still wet. I rubbed my thumb over an 
edge of the cape. The ink didn’t come off. 

I wonder if Starenko drew this portrait, I thought, studying it. 

Glancing across the table, I saw a stack of papers on a low counter that ran 
along the entire back wall. Hopping off the tall stool, I made my way over to the 
counter and began shuffling through the papers. 

They were ink drawings and pencil sketches. Many of them were of The 
Masked Mutant. They showed him in different poses. Some of them showed him 
moving his molecules around, changing into wild animals and strange, unearthly 
creatures. 

I opened a thick folder and found about a dozen color sketches of the 
members of The League of Good Guys. Then I found a stack of pencil drawings 
of characters I’d never seen before. 

This must be where they make the comic books! I told myself. 

I was so excited about seeing these actual drawings and sketches, I nearly 
forgot about Libby. 

This pink-and-green building must be the headquarters of Collectable 
Comics, I realized. 

I was starting to feel calmer. My fears dropped away like feathers off The 
Battling Bird-Boy. 

After all, there was nothing to be afraid of. I hadn’t stumbled into the 
headquarters of the world’s most evil supervillain. I was in the basement of the 
comic book offices. 

This is where the writers and artists worked. And this is where they print 
the comic books every month. 

So why should I be afraid? 

I shuffled through folder after folder, making my way down the long 



counter. I found a pile of layouts for a comic book that I had just bought. 

It was so exciting seeing the actual art. The page was really big, at least 
twice as big as the comic book. I guessed that the artists made their drawings 
much bigger than the actual page. And then they shrank the drawings down 
when they printed them. 

I found some really new pencil drawings of The Masked Mutant. I knew 
they were new because I didn’t recognize them from my comics at home—and I 
have them all! 

Drawing after drawing. My eyes were practically spinning! 

I never dreamed that Collectable Comics were made right in Riverview 
Falls. 

I flipped through a sketchbook of Penguin People portraits. I never liked the 
Penguin People. I know they’re good guys, and people really think they’re great. 
But I think their black-and-white costumes just look silly. 

I was having a great time. Really enjoying myself. 

Of course it had to end. 

It ended when I opened the last folder on the counter. And stared at the 
sketches inside. 

I gaped at them in disbelief, my hands trembling as I shuffled from one to 
the next. 

“This is impossible!” I cried out loud. 

I was staring at sketches of ME. 



15 


I frantically shuffled through the big stack of drawings. 

You’re just imagining it, Skipper, I told myself. The boy in the sketches 
only looks like you. It isn’t really you. 

But it had to be me. 

In every drawing, the boy had my round face, my dark hair—cut short on 
the sides and long on top. 

He was short like me. And just a little bit chubby. He had my crooked 
smile, up a little higher on one side. He wore my clothes—baggy jeans and long- 
sleeved, pocket T-shirts. 

I stopped at a drawing halfway through the pile and stared hard at it, 
holding it close to my face. “Oh, wow!” I exclaimed. 

The boy in the drawing even had a chip on his front tooth. Just like me. 

“It’s impossible!” I cried out loud, my voice tiny and shrill in the enormous 
room. 

Who had been drawing me? And why? Why would a comic book artist 
make sketch after sketch of me? 

And how did the artist know me so well? How did the artist know that I 
have a tiny chip on one front tooth? 

A cold shiver ran down my back. I suddenly felt very frightened. I stared at 
the drawings, my heart pounding. 

In one drawing, I looked really scared. I was running from something, my 
arms out stiffly in front of me. 

Another drawing was a close-up portrait of my face. My expression in the 
sketch was angry. No. More than angry. I looked furious. 

Another sketch showed me flexing my muscles. Hey, I look pretty cool! I 
thought. The artist had given me bulging superhero biceps. 

In another drawing, my eyes were closed. Was I asleep? Or was I dead? 

I was still staring at the drawings, shuffling from one to the next, studying 
each one—when I heard the footsteps. 

And realized I was no longer alone. 

“Who-who’s there?” I cried, whirling around. 



16 


“Where were you?” Libby demanded angrily, running across the room toward 
me. “I searched everywhere!” 

“Where were you?” I shot back. “I thought you were right behind me.” 

“I thought you were right ahead of me!” she cried. “I turned a corner, and 
you were gone.” She stopped in front of me, breathing hard, her face bright red. 
“How could you leave me by myself in this creepy place?” 

“I didn’t!” I insisted. “You left me!” 

She shook her head, still gasping for breath. “Well, let’s get out of here, 
Skipper. I found some elevators that are working.” She tugged my sleeve. 

I picked up the stack of drawings. “Look, Libby.” I held them up to her. 
“You have to see these.” 

“Are you serious?” she cried. “I want to get out of here. I don’t want to look 
at comic book drawings now!” 

“But—but—” I sputtered, waving the drawings. 

She turned and started toward the doorway. “I told you I found some 
elevators. Are you coming or not?” 

“But these are drawings of me!” I cried. 

“Yeah. Sure,” she called back sarcastically. She stopped at the front of the 
big printing press and turned back to me. “Why would anyone draw you, 
Skipper?” 

“I-I don’t know,” I stammered. “But these drawings—” 

“You have a sick imagination,” she said. “You seem like a normal guy. But 
you’re totally weird. Bye.” Libby started jogging over the paper-cluttered floor 
to the door. 

“No—wait!” I called. I dropped the drawings onto the counter, slid off the 
tall stool, and chased after her. “Wait up, Libby!” 

I followed her out into the hall. I didn’t want to be left alone in this creepy 
place, either. I had to get home and think about this. I had to puzzle it out. 

My head was spinning. I felt totally confused. 

I followed her through the long tunnel of hallways. We turned a corner, and 
I saw a row of elevators against the wall. 

Libby pushed the button on the wall, and one of the elevators slid open 



silently. We both peered carefully inside before stepping on. It was empty. 

We were both panting. My head was throbbing. My side ached. Neither of 
us spoke a word. 

Libby pushed the button marked LOBBY. We heard a soft hum and felt the 
elevator start to move. 

When the door slid open, and we saw the pink-and-yellow walls of the 
lobby, Libby and I both cheered. We burst out of the elevator together and ran 
across the marble floor to the exit. 

Out on the sidewalk, I stopped, lowering my hands to my knees, sucking in 
deep breaths of fresh air. When I glanced up, I saw Libby studying her watch. 

“I’ve got to get home,” she said. “My mom is going to have a cow!” 

“Do you believe me about the drawings?” I asked breathlessly. 

“No,” she replied. “Who would believe that?” She waved and made her 
way across the street, heading for home. 

I could see a bus approaching, a few blocks down. Searching in my jeans 
pocket for a token, I turned to take one last look at the weird building. 

It had vanished once again. 

I needed time to think about everything that had happened. But Wilson was 
waiting for me when I got home, and he followed me up to my room. 

“I brought over some of my rubber stamps,” he said, raising a brown paper 
bag up to my face. He turned it over and emptied it onto my desk. “I thought you 
might like to see some of the better ones.” 

“Wilson—” I started. “I really don’t—” 

“This one is a ladybug,” he said, holding up a small wooden stamp. “It’s 
very old. It’s the oldest one I own. Here. I’ll show it to you.” He opened a blue 
inkpad, stamped the ladybug on it, and pressed it onto the top of a pad of paper I 
had on the desk. 

“How old is it?” I asked him. 

“I don’t know,” he replied. He held up another one. “It’s a cow,” he said. As 
if I couldn’t tell. He stamped it onto the pad. “I have several cows,” Wilson said. 
“But I only brought one.” 

I studied the cow, pretending to be interested. 

“It’s another really old one,” Wilson said proudly. 

“How old?” I asked. 

He shrugged. “Beats me.” He reached for another stamp. 



“Uh... Wilson... I just had a really weird thing happen,” I told him. “And I 
need to think about it. Alone.” 

He narrowed his blue eyes at me, confused. “What happened?” 

“It’s kind of a long story,” I said. “I was in a building. On the north side of 
town. I think it’s where they make the Collectable Comics.” 

“Really? Here in Riverview Falls?” Wilson’s face filled with surprise. “And 
they let you in?” 

“There was no one there,” I told him. It felt good to share the story with 
someone. “So we went in. This girl I met on the bus. Libby. And me. We tried to 
go up in the elevator. But it took us down. Then Libby got lost. And I found a 
stack of drawings of myself.” 

“Whoa!” Wilson exclaimed, raising a hand for me to stop. “I’m not 
following this too well, Skipper.” 

I realized what I had said didn’t make any sense at all. How could I explain 
it? 

I told Wilson I’d talk to him later, after I calmed down. I helped him gather 
up his rubber stamps. He’d brought about twenty of them. “Twenty of the best,” 
he said. 

I walked him downstairs and said I’d call him after dinner. 

After he left, something caught my eye on the mail table in the hall. A 
brown envelope. 

My heart jumped. Was it—? Yes! An envelope from the Collectable Comics 
company. The next special issue of The Masked Mutant 

I was so excited, I nearly knocked the whole table over as I grabbed for the 
envelope. I tucked it under my arm without opening it and ran up the stairs, two 
at a time. 

I need total privacy. I have to study this! I told myself. 

I closed the bedroom door behind me and dropped down onto the edge of 
the bed. My hands trembled as I ripped open the envelope and pulled out the 
comic book. 

The cover showed a closeup of The Masked Mutant. His eyes glared 
angrily out at the reader. A NEW FOE FOR THE MUTANT! proclaimed the title. 

Huh? A new foe? 

I took a deep breath and held it. Calm down, Skipper, I urged myself. It’s 
only a comic book. 

But would this new issue help to solve the mystery for me? 



Would it tell me anything about the strange, pink-and-green headquarters 
building? Would it help solve any of the puzzles from this afternoon? 

I turned to the first page. It showed the headquarters building from above. 
The next drawing showed the building at street level. In the deep shadows, 
someone was approaching the glass doors. 

Someone was sneaking into the headquarters building. 

I turned the page. 

And shrieked at the top of my lungs: “I don’t believe it!” 



17 


Yes. You probably guessed it. It was ME sneaking into The Masked Mutant’s 
headquarters building. 

I stared at the page so hard, I thought my eyes were going to pop out of my 
head. 

I was so excited—and so shocked—I couldn’t read the words. They became 
a gray blur. 

I turned the pages with shaking hands. I don’t think I took a breath. I 
studied each picture, holding the comic book about an inch from my face. 

The Galloping Gazelle sat in a tiny room. The room grew hotter and hotter. 
In minutes, The Galloping Gazelle would become The Boiled Gazelle! 

The Masked Mutant had trapped The Galloping Gazelle in his headquarters. 
And now he planned to leave The Gazelle there to boil. 

I turned the page. My hand shook so hard, I nearly tore the page off. 

There I was, creeping through the dark hallway. In the comic, I wore the 
same T-shirt and baggy jeans I had on right now. 

The next drawing showed a closeup of my face. Big balls of sweat rolled 
down my pink face. I guess that meant I was scared. 

I’m a little too chubby in that drawing, I thought. 

But it was me. It was definitely ME! 

“Mom!” I screamed, closing the comic and jumping off the bed. “Mom! 
Dad! You have to see this!” 

I tore out of my room and hurtled down the stairs. I don’t think my feet 
touched the floor! 

“Mom! Dad! Where are you?” 

I found them in the kitchen, preparing dinner. Dad was chopping onions by 
the sink. His eyes were filled with tears. Mom was bent over the stove. As usual, 
she was having trouble getting the oven lit. 

“I’m in this comic book!” I cried, bursting into the room. 

“Not now!” they both replied in unison. 

“No. You have to see this!” I insisted, waving it in front of Dad. 

Dad didn’t stop chopping. “You had a letter to the editor published?” he 
asked through his tears. 



“No! I’m in the comic!” I told him breathlessly. I waved it closer to him. 

“I can’t see a thing!” Dad exclaimed. “Get that away from me. Can’t you 
see what this onion is doing to my eyes?” 

“There’s a trick to chopping onions,” Mom said, bent over the stove. “But I 
don’t know what it is.” 

I ran over to Mom. “You have to check this out, Mom. I’m in here. Look. 
It’s really me!” 

Mom shook her head, frowning. “I can’t get it to light,” she said, sighing. “I 
think the pilot is out again.” 

“I’ll check it if I ever stop crying,” Dad told her. 

“Willyou look at this?!” I screamed, totally losing it. 

Mom gave a quick glance to the page I was holding in front of her. “Yes, 
yes. That does look a little like you, Skipper,” she said, waving me away. She 
turned back to the oven. “We really need a new stove, dear.” 

“Dad—take a look,” I pleaded. 

I ran back to him, but he had shoved a towel up to his face and was crying 
into the towel. “I guess you can’t look now, huh?” I said softly. 

He didn’t answer. He just cried into the towel. 

I let out a long, exasperated moan. What was their problem, anyway? 

This was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me. And they 
couldn’t be bothered to take one look. 

Angrily, I closed the comic and stomped out of the room. 

“Skipper, set the table,” Mom shouted after me. 

Set the table? I’m starring in a famous comic book, and she’s asking me to 
set the table? 

“Why can’t Mitzi do it?” I asked. 

“Set the table, Skipper,” Mom repeated sternly. 

“Okay, okay. In a few minutes,” I called back. I dropped down onto the 
living room couch and turned to the back of the comic. I had been too excited to 
read it to the end. Now I wanted to read the part where it tells you what to expect 
in the next comic book. 

My eyes swept over the page. There was The Galloping Gazelle, still 
trapped in the boiling hot room. And there stood The Masked Mutant outside the 
door, about to declare his victory. 

I squinted at the white thought balloon over The Galloping Gazelle’s head. 
What was he saying? 



“Only the boy can save me now,” The Galloping Gazelle was thinking. 
“Only the boy can save the world from The Masked Mutant’s evil. But where is 
he?” 

I read it again. And again. 

Was it true? Was I the only one who could save The Galloping Gazelle? 

Did I really have to go back there? 



18 


After school the next day, I hurried to the bus stop. It was a clear, cold day. The 
ground beneath my sneakers was frozen hard. The sky above looked like a broad 
sheet of cold, blue ice. 

Leaning into the sharp wind, I wondered if Libby would be on the bus. I 
was dying to tell her about the comic book. I wanted to tell her I was going back 
into the strange building. 

Would she go back with me? 

No way, I decided. Libby had been frightened after our first visit, I could 
never drag her back there. 

I jogged past the playground, my eyes on the street, watching for a bus. 

“Hey, Skipper!” a familiar voice called. I turned to see Wilson running after 
me, his coat unzipped and flapping up behind him like wings. “Skipper—what’s 
up? You going home?” 

Two blocks up, the blue-and-white bus turned the corner. 

“No. I’m going someplace,” I told Wilson. “I can’t look at your rubber 
stamp collection now.” 

His expression turned serious. “I’m not collecting rubber stamps anymore,” 
he said. “I gave it up.” 

I couldn’t hide my surprise. “Huh? How come?” 

“They took up too much of my time,” he replied. 

The bus pulled to the curb. The door opened. “See you later,” I told Wilson. 

As I stepped on to the bus, I remembered where I was going. And I 
suddenly wondered if I would see Wilson later. I wondered if I would ever see 
him again! 

Libby wasn’t on the bus. In a way, I was glad. It meant I wouldn’t have to 
explain to her what I was doing. 

She would have laughed at me for believing what I read in a comic book. 

But the comic book had told the truth about the Invisibility Curtain. And 
now it had said that I was the only one who could save The Galloping Gazelle 
and stop The Masked Mutant’s evil. 

“But it’s just a comic book!” Libby would have said. “How can you be such 



a jerk to believe a comic book?” 

That’s what she would have said. And I don’t know how I could have 
answered. 

So I was glad she wasn’t on the bus. 

I climbed off the bus in front of the empty lot. 

I gazed at it from across the street. I knew it wasn’t really an empty lot. I 
knew the pink-and-green building was there, hidden behind the Invisibility 
Curtain. 

As I crossed the street, I felt a wave of fear sweep down over me. My 
mouth suddenly got dry. I tried to swallow, but nearly choked. My throat felt as 
if someone had tied a knot in it. My stomach felt kind of fluttery. And my knees 
got sweaty and refused to bend. 

I stopped on the sidewalk and struggled to calm myself down. 

It’s just a comic book. Just a comic book. That’s what I told myself, 
repeating the words over and over. 

Finally, staring straight ahead at the empty lot, I worked up my courage 
enough to move forward. One step. Another. Another. 

Suddenly, the building popped into view. 

I gasped. Even though I had crossed through the Invisibility Curtain before, 
it was still amazing to see a building suddenly appear before my eyes. 

Swallowing hard, I pulled open one of the glass entrance doors and stepped 
into the bright, pink-and-yellow lobby. 

Staying near the door, I turned to the left, then the right. 

Still empty. Not a person in sight. 

I coughed. My cough sounded tiny in the huge lobby. My sneakers 
squeaked over the marble floor as I started to the elevators on the far wall. 

Where is everyone? I asked myself. It’s the middle of the afternoon. How 
can I be the only one in this huge lobby? 

I stopped in front of the elevators. I raised my finger to the elevator button 
—but I didn’t push it. 

I wish Libby had come along, I decided. If Libby were here, at least I’d 
have someone to be terrified with ! 

I pushed the elevator button. 

“Well... here goes,” I murmured, waiting for the door to open. 

And then someone laughed. A cold, evil laugh. 

Right behind me. 



19 


I let out a low cry and spun around. 

No one there. 

The laughter repeated. Soft, but cruel. 

My eyes darted around the lobby. I couldn’t see anyone. 

“Wh-who’s there?” I choked out. 

The laughter stopped. 

I continued to search. My eyes went up to the wall above the elevator. A 
small, black loudspeaker poked out from the yellow wall. 

The laughter must have come from there, I decided. I stared up at it as if I 
expected to see someone in there. 

Get out of here! a voice inside me begged. My sensible voice. Just turn 
around, Skipper, and run out of this building as fast as your rubbery, shaky legs 
will take you! 

I ignored it and pressed the elevator button. The elevator door on the left 
slid open silently, and I stepped inside. 

The door closed. I stared at the control panel. Should I push up or down? 

The last visit, I had pushed up, the top floor—and the elevator had taken 
Libby and me down to the basement. 

My finger hesitated in front of the buttons. What would happen if this time 
I pushed down ? 

I didn’t get a chance to find out. The elevator started with a jolt before I 
pushed any button at all. 

I grabbed on to the railing. My hand was cold and wet. The elevator 
hummed as it rose. 

I’m going up, I realized. Up to where? 

The ride seemed to take forever. I watched the floor numbers whir by on 
top of the control panel. Forty... forty-one... forty-two... The elevator beeped 
each time it passed a floor. 

It came to a stop at forty-six. Was this the top floor? 

The door slid open. I let go of the railing and stepped out. 

I glanced down a long, gray hallway. I blinked once. Twice. It looked as if I 
had stepped into a black-and-white movie. The walls were gray. The ceiling was 



gray. The floor was gray. The doors on both sides of the hall were gray. 

It feels like I’m standing in a thick, gray fog, I thought, peering one way, 
then the other. Or in a dark cloud. 

No one in sight. Nothing moving. 

I listened hard. Listened for voices, for laughter, for the click and hum of 
office machinery. 

Silence—except for the thudding of my heart. 

I shoved my cold, clammy hands into the pockets of my jeans and began to 
walk, slowly following the hallway. 

I turned a corner and stared down another endless, gray hallway. The end of 
the hall seemed to fade away, to fade into a gray blur. 

I suddenly remembered the drawings in the newest issue of The Masked 
Mutant. A big, two-page drawing had shown the long hallways of The Masked 
Mutant’s secret headquarters. 

The long, twisting hallway in the comic book looked just like this hallway 
—except that the comic book hallway had bright green walls and a yellow 
ceiling. And the rooms were filled with costumed supervillains who worked for 
The Masked Mutant. 

As I slowly made my way through this gray, empty hallway, I had a weird 
thought. Everything looked so gray and washed out, I had the feeling that I was 
in a sketch of a hallway. A black-and-white pencil drawing that hadn’t been 
filled in yet. 

But, of course, that didn’t make any sense at all. 

You’re just thinking crazy thoughts because you’re so scared, I told myself. 

And then I heard a noise. 

A hard, thumping sound. A bump. 

“Whoa!” I whispered. My heart leaped up to my throat. I stopped in the 
middle of the hall. And listened. 

Bump. Thump. 

Coming from up ahead. From around the next corner? 

I forced myself to walk. I turned the corner. And gasped at the bright colors. 

The walls down this hallway were bright green. The ceiling was yellow. 
The thick carpet under my sneakers was a dark, wine-red. 

Bump. Bump. Thump. 

The colors were so bright, I had to shield my eyes with one hand. 

I squinted to the end of the hall. The green walls led to a closed yellow 



door. The door had a metal bolt against the front. 

Thump. Thump. 

The sounds were coming from behind the bolted doorway. 

I made my way slowly down the hall to the doorway. 

I stopped outside the bolted door. “Anyone in there?” I tried to call into the 
room. But my voice came out in a choked whisper. 

I coughed and tried again. “Anyone in there?” 

No reply. 

Then, another loud bumping sound. Like wood thumping against wood. 

“Anyone in there?” I called, my voice a little stronger. 

The thumping sounds stopped. “Can you help me?” a man’s voice called 
from inside the room. 

I froze. 

“Can you help me?” the man pleaded. 

I hesitated for a second. Should I try to help him? 

Yes. 

I raised both hands to the metal bolt. I took a deep breath and shoved the 
bolt with all my strength. 

To my surprise, it slid easily. 

The door was unlocked. I turned the handle and pushed the door open. 

I stumbled off-balance into the room and stared in amazement at the figure 
staring back at me. 

“You—you’re real?” I cried. 



20 


His cape was twisted, and his mask had rolled down over one eye. But I knew I 
was staring at The Galloping Gazelle. 

“You’re really alive?” I blurted out. 

“Of course,” he replied impatiently. “Untie me, kid.” He gazed toward the 
open door. “You’d better hurry.” 

I realized that his powerful arms and legs were tied to the chair. The 
thumping and bumping had been the sounds of his chair banging against the 
floor as he had tried to escape. 

“I—I can’t believe that you’re here!” I cried. I was so amazed—and so 
frightened—I didn’t know what I was saying! 

“I’ll give you my autograph later,” he said, his eyes still on the doorway. 
“Just hurry, okay? We’ve got to get out of here. I don’t think we have much 
time.” 

“T-time?” I stammered. 

“He’ll be back,” The Galloping Gazelle murmured. “We want to get to him 
before he gets to us, right, kid?” 

“Us?!” I cried. 

“Just untie me,” The Galloping Gazelle instructed. “I can handle him.” He 
shook his head. “I wish I could contact my buddies at the League. They’re 
probably all searching the universe for me.” 

Still half dazed, I stumbled across the tiny room to the chair and began 
working at the ropes. The knots were big and tight and hard to untie. The coarse 
rope scraped my hands as I struggled to loosen them. 

“Hurry, kid,” The Galloping Gazelle urged. “Hey, how did you find the 
secret headquarters, anyway?” 

“I... just found it,” I replied, tugging at the knots. 

“Don’t be modest, kid,” the superhero said in his flat, low voice. “You used 
your secret cyber-radar powers, right? Or did you use ultra-mind control to read 
my thoughts and hurry to my rescue?” 

“No. I just took the bus,” I replied. 

I didn’t really know how to answer him. Did he have me confused with 
someone else? 



Why was I here? What was going to happen to us? To me? 

Questions, questions. They flew through my mind as I frantically worked at 
the heavy ropes. 

I tried to ignore the pain from the cuts and scrapes to my hands. But it hurt 

a lot. 

Finally, one of the knots slid open. The Galloping Gazelle flexed his 
muscles and stretched out his powerful chest—and the ropes popped away 
easily. 

“Thanks, kid,” he boomed, jumping to his feet. He adjusted his mask so that 
he could see through both eyeholes. Then he swept his long cape behind him and 
straightened his tights. 

“Okay. Let’s go pay him a surprise visit,” he said, pulling up the ends of his 
gloves. He started toward the door, taking long, heavy strides. His boots 
thundered loudly as he walked. 

“Uh... do you really want me to come, too?” I asked, lingering behind the 
chair. 

He nodded. “I know what you’re worried about, kid. You’re worried that 
you won’t be able to keep up with me because I have dyno-legs and I’m the 
fastest living mutant in the known universe.” 

“Well...” I hesitated. 

“Don’t worry,” he replied. “I’ll go slow.” He motioned impatiently. “Let’s 
get moving.” 

I tripped over the tangle of ropes on the floor. Grabbed the chair to catch 
my balance. Then followed him out into the green-and-yellow hallway. 

He turned and began running down the hall. As I started to follow, he 
became a blue-and-red blur of light—and then vanished. 

A few seconds later, he came jogging back. “Sorry. Too fast for you?” he 
called. 

I nodded. “A little.” 

He rested a gloved hand heavily on my shoulder. His gray eyes peered at 
me solemnly through the slits in his mask. “Do you have wall-climbing 
abilities?” he demanded. 

I shook my head. “No. Sorry.” 

“Okay. We’ll take the stairs,” he said. 

He grabbed my hand and pulled me down the hall. He moved so fast, both 
of my feet were in the air. 



I guess it was impossible for him to go slow. 

The walls whirred past in a bright green blur. He pulled me around a corner, 
then another corner. 

I felt as if I were flying! We were moving so fast, I didn’t have time to 
breathe. 

Around another corner. Then through an open doorway. 

The doorway led to a flight of steep, dark stairs. I peered up to the top, but I 
could see only heavy blackness. 

I expected The Galloping Gazelle to pull me up the stairs. But to my 
surprise, he stopped just past the doorway. 

He narrowed his eyes at the stairs. “There is a disintegrator-ray there,” he 
announced, rubbing his square jaw thoughtfully. 

“A what?” I cried. 

“A disintegrator-ray,” he repeated, his eyes locked on the stairs. “If you step 
into it, it will disintegrate you in one hundredth of a second.” 

I swallowed hard. My entire body started to tremble. 

“Do you think you can jump the first two steps?” The Galloping Gazelle 
asked. 

“You mean—?” I started. 

“Land on the third step,” he instructed. “Get a good running start.” 

I’ll need it, I thought, staring at the steep steps. 

I suddenly wished I hadn’t eaten so many Pop-Tarts and bowls of Frosted 
Flakes for breakfast every morning. If only I were a little slimmer, a little lighter. 

“Get a good running start and make sure you clear the first two steps,” The 
Galloping Gazelle warned. “Land on the third step and keep moving. If you land 
on the first or second step, you’ll disintegrate.” He motioned with his fingers. 
“Poof.” 

I let out a low, frightened moan. I couldn’t help myself. I wanted to be 
brave. But my body wasn’t cooperating. It was shaking and quaking as if I were 
made of Jell-O. 

“I’ll go first,” the superhero said. He turned to the stairs, bent his knees, 
stretched both hands forward—and leaped over the invisible disintegrator-ray. 
He landed on the fifth step. 

He turned around and motioned for me to follow. “See? It’s easy,” he said 
brightly. 

Easy for you! I thought darkly. Some of us don’t have dyno-legs. 



“Hurry,” he urged. “If you stop to think about it, you won’t be able to do it.” 

I’m already thinking about it! I thought. 

How can I not think about it? 

“I—I’m not very athletic,” I murmured in a tiny, trembling voice. What an 
understatement! Whenever the kids I know play any sports, I am always the last 
kid chosen for a team. 

“Hurry,” The Galloping Gazelle urged. He reached out both hands. “Take a 
good running jump, kid. Aim for the third step. It isn’t that high. I’ll catch you.” 

The third step looked about a mile in the air to me. But I held my breath, 
bent my knees, took a running leap—my best leap— 

—and I landed with a hard thud on the first step. 



21 


I screamed and clamped my eyes shut as the disintegrator-ray poured through 
me, and my body crumbled into thin air. 

Actually, I didn’t feel anything. 

I opened my eyes to find myself still standing on the bottom step. Still in 
one chubby piece. 

“I—I—I—” I stammered. 

“I guess he doesn’t have it turned on,” The Galloping Gazelle said calmly. 
He smiled at me through the mask. “You caught a break, kid.” 

I was still trembling. Cold beads of sweat rolled down my forehead. I 
couldn’t speak. 

“Hope your luck holds out,” The Galloping Gazelle muttered. He turned 
and started up the stairs, his cape floating behind him. “Come on. Let’s go meet 
our destiny.” 

I didn’t like the sound of that. Not one bit. 

But I didn’t like anything that was going on. The Galloping Gazelle had 
said that I was lucky. 

But I certainly didn’t feel lucky as I followed him up the dark stairs. 

At the top landing, he pushed open a wide metal door, and we stepped into 
an amazing room. 

The room glowed with color. It was decorated like an office, the fanciest, 
most luxurious office I have ever seen. 

The shaggy white carpet was soft and so thick, I sank in it nearly to my 
ankles. Silky blue curtains were draped over enormous windows that overlooked 
the town. Sparkly, crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling. 

Velvety couches and chairs were arranged around dark wood tables. One 
wall was covered with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, each shelf filled with 
leather-covered books. 

A giant TV screen—dark—stood in one corner. Beside it, a wall of 
electronic equipment. Enormous oil paintings of green farm fields covered one 
wall. 

A shiny, gold-plated desk stood in the middle of the room. The tall desk 
chair behind it looked more like a throne than a chair. 



“Wow!” I cried, lingering near the door, my eyes taking in the splendor of 
the vast room. 

“He treats himself nice,” The Galloping Gazelle commented. “But his time 
is over.” 

“You mean—?” I started. 

“I’m too fast for him,” the superhero boasted. 

“I’ll run circles around him, faster and faster—until I become a raging 
tornado. He’ll be swept away forever.” 

“Wow,” I repeated. I didn’t know what else to say. 

“He caught me napping before,” The Galloping Gazelle continued. “That’s 
the only way he can catch me. When I’m asleep. Otherwise, I’m much too fast 
for him. Too fast for anybody. Know how fast I run the one-hundred?” 

“How fast?” I asked. 

“I run it in one-tenth. One-tenth of a second. That would be an Olympic 
record. But they don’t let me in the Olympics because I’m a mutant.” 

I started to follow The Galloping Gazelle to the center of the room. But I 
stopped when I heard the laughter. 

The same cold laughter I had heard in the lobby. 

I froze in fright. 

And stared as the gold desk began to move. And change. 

The shiny gold shimmered as it shifted and bent, raising itself up and 
forming a human figure. 

I took a step back, trying to hide behind The Galloping Gazelle as the desk 
melted away—and The Masked Mutant rose up in its place. 

His dark eyes burned menacingly through the slits in his mask. He was a lot 
taller than he appeared in the comic. And a lot more powerful-looking. 

And a lot scarier. 

He raised a fist at The Galloping Gazelle. “You dare to invade my private 
office?” he demanded. 

“Say good-bye to all this ill-gotten splendor,” The Galloping Gazelle told 
the Mutant. 

“I’ll say good-bye to you!” The Masked Mutant shot back, spitting the 
words angrily. 

Then he turned his frightening, cold eyes on me. “I’ll handle you easily, 
Gazelle,” the world’s most evil supervillain said softly. “But, first, watch me 
destroy the kid!” 



22 


I shrank back as The Masked Mutant took a step toward me, his fist still raised, 
his black eyes glaring furiously into mine. 

My heart pounding, I turned and frantically searched for a hiding place. 

But there was nowhere to hide. 

And I couldn’t make a run for it. The door slammed shut as The Masked 
Mutant moved closer. 

“Whoa!” I cried. I raised both hands in front of my face, as if shielding 
myself. 

I couldn’t bear to see his cold, cruel eyes glaring at me as he approached. 
He’s going to destroy me, I thought. But I don’t have to watch! 

And, then, as The Masked Mutant took one more step, The Galloping 
Gazelle moved to block his way. “You’ll deal with me, Mutant!” he declared in 
his booming voice. “If you want the kid, you’ll have to take me out first.” 

“No problem,” The Masked Mutant declared softly. 

But his expression changed as The Galloping Gazelle began to circle him. 
Faster and faster—until the Gazelle appeared to disappear into a whirling, 
spinning tornado of blue and red. 

The Gazelle is carrying out his plan, I realized as I backed up to the wall. 
He’s going to run faster and faster around The Masked Mutant until he creates a 
whirlwind that will blow the evil Mutant away. 

Pressing my back against the wall, I watched the amazing battle eagerly. 
The Galloping Gazelle whirled faster. Faster. So fast, a powerful wind swept 
over the room, slapping the curtains, toppling over a vase of flowers, sending 
books flying from the shelves. 

Yes! I thought happily, shooting both fists into the air. Yes ! We win! We 

win! 

I lowered my hands and let out a horrified groan when I saw The Masked 
Mutant casually stick his foot out. 

The Galloping Gazelle tripped over the foot and slammed facedown onto 
the floor with a shattering thud. 

He bounced hard a couple of times and then lay still. 

The wind stopped. The curtains fell back in place. 



The Masked Mutant stood over the fallen superhero, hands triumphantly on 
the waist of his costume. 

“Get up!” I screamed, without even realizing I was doing it. “Get up, 
Gazelle! Please!” 

The Gazelle groaned, but didn’t move. 

“Dinnertime,” sneered The Masked Mutant. 

My back pressed hard against the wall, I stared in horror as The Mutant 
began to change again. His face twisted and appeared to flatten. His body 
lowered, and he leaned forward, spreading his hands on the floor. 

He stepped forward as a snarling leopard. Tilting its head to one side, the 
leopard uttered a ferocious growl of attack. 

Then it arched its back, tensed its back legs—and leaped on to the sprawled 
body of The Galloping Gazelle. 

“Get up! Get up, Gazelle!” I shrieked as the leopard attacked. 

The Masked Mutant clawed and gnawed at the helpless Gazelle. 

“Get up! Get up!” I screamed. 

To my shock, The Galloping Gazelle opened his eyes. 

The ferocious leopard ripped away the bottom of The Gazelle’s mask with 
its teeth. 

The Galloping Gazelle rolled out from under the enormous beast and 
scrambled to his feet. 

With a roar, the leopard swiped its paws, sending a long tear down the 
length of The Gazelle’s cape. 

“I’m outta here!” The Gazelle cried, making tracks to the door. He turned 
back to me. “You’re on your own, kid!” 

“No! Wait!” I screamed. 

I don’t think The Gazelle heard me. He shoved open the door with one 
shoulder and vanished. 

The door slammed behind him. 

Quickly, the leopard changed, rising up on its hind legs, its body shifting 
and moving—until The Masked Mutant stepped forward. 

He smiled at me as he approached, a cold, menacing smile. 

“You’re on your own, kid,” he said softly. 



23 


I edged along the wall as The Masked Mutant moved slowly, steadily toward me. 
I knew I couldn’t get to the door, as The Galloping Gazelle had. I wasn’t fast 
enough. 

He should call himself The Galloping Chicken! I thought bitterly. 

How could he save his own skin and leave me here like this? 

I couldn’t run. I couldn’t fight. What could I do? 

What could I do against a deadly foe who could turn himself into anything 
solid? 

The Masked Mutant stopped in the center of the room, hands on his waist, 
his dark eyes twinkling. He was enjoying my fright. And already tasting his 
victory. 

“What are your powers, kid?” he demanded, a sneer in his voice. 

“Huh?” His question caught me by surprise. 

“What are your powers?” he repeated impatiently, swirling his cape behind 
him. “Do you shrink down to a tiny bug? Is that your secret?” 

“Huh? Shrink? Me?” I was shaking so hard, I couldn’t think straight. 

Why was he asking me these questions? 

“Do you burst into flames?” he continued, moving closer. “Is that your 
power? Are you magnetic? Are you a mind-fogger?” His voice turned angry. 
“What is it, kid? Answer me! What is your power?” 

“I—I don’t have any powers,” I stammered. If I pressed any harder into the 
wall, I’d become part of the wallpaper! 

The Masked Mutant laughed. “So you won’t tell me, huh? Okay, okay. 
Have it your way.” 

His smile faded. His dark eyes turned cold and hard. “I was just trying to 
make it easy on you,” he said, moving even closer. “I want to destroy you in the 
easiest way possible.” 

“Oh. I see,” I muttered. 

My eye caught something on the shelf. A large, smooth stone as big as a 
coconut. It was some kind of decoration. I wondered if it would make a good 
weapon. 

“Say bye-bye, kid,” he said through clenched teeth. 



He came toward me quickly. 

And as he moved, I grabbed the big stone off the shelf. It was a lot heavier 
than I’d thought. It wasn’t stone, I realized. It was shaped like a smooth stone. 
But it was made of solid steel. 

I hoisted it up and took careful aim. Then I heaved it at The Masked 
Mutant’s head. And missed. 

The stone thudded heavily onto the carpet. “Nice try,” he muttered... 

.. .and moved quickly to destroy me. 



24 


I tried to duck away from him, but he was too quick. 

His powerful hands grabbed me around the waist and lifted me off the floor. 

Higher. Higher. 

I realized he was moving his molecules, making his arms stretch until he 
had lifted me above the chandelier. 

I thrashed my arms and legs and tried to squirm away. But he was too 
strong. 

Higher. Higher. Until my head banged hard against the ceiling, at least 
twenty feet above the floor. 

“Happy landings!” The Masked Mutant cried gleefully as he prepared to 
drop me and send me plummeting to my doom. 

But before he could drop me, I heard the door swing open. 

The Masked Mutant heard it, too. Holding me suspended in the air, he 
turned to see who had entered. “You!” he cried in surprise. 

High above the floor, I squirmed around and bent my head to see through 
the chandelier. The light sparkled through the crystals, making it impossible to 
see. 

“How dare you burst in here!” The Masked Mutant cried to the intruder. 

He lowered me a little. Just enough for me to see the doorway. 

“Libby!” I cried. “What are you doing here?” 



25 


The Masked Mutant lowered me to the floor and turned to face Libby. My legs 
were wobbling so badly, I had to grab on to a bookshelf to hold myself up. 

“Libby—get out of here! Get away!” I tried to warn her. 

But she stormed into the room, her red hair flying behind her. She had her 
eyes on me and completely ignored The Masked Mutant. 

Doesn’t she know that he is the most evil supervillain in the known 
universe? 

“Skipper—didn’t you hear me calling you?” Libby demanded sharply. 

“Huh? Libby—” 

“I was across the street,” she said. “I saw you going into this building. I 
called to you.” 

“I—I didn’t hear you,” I stammered. “Listen, you’d better get out of here, 
Libby.” 

“I’ve been searching and searching for you,” she continued, ignoring my 
warning, ignoring my frantic gestures. “What are you doing in here, Skipper?” 

“Uh... I really can’t talk right now,” I replied, pointing to The Masked 
Mutant. 

He stood impatiently, hands at his waist, tapping his boot on the carpet. “I 
see that I will have to destroy you both,” he said quietly. 

Libby spun around. She seemed to notice the supervillain for the first time. 
“Skipper and I are leaving now,” she said with a sneer. 

I gasped. Didn’t she know who she was talking to ? 

No. Of course she didn’t know. She reads only High School Harry & 
Beanhead comics. She has no idea how much danger we are in! I realized. 

“I’m sorry,” The Masked Mutant replied, sneering back at Libby from 
under his mask. “You are not leaving. In fact, you are never leaving this building 
again.” 

Libby glared back at him, and I saw her expression change. Her green eyes 
grew wide, and her mouth dropped open. 

She took a step back until she stood beside me. “We have to do something,” 
she whispered. 

Do something? 



What could we do against the monstrous mega-mutant? 

I swallowed hard. I couldn’t think of how to answer her. 

The Masked Mutant tossed back his cape and took a step toward us. 
“Which one of you wants to go first?” he demanded softly. 

I turned and saw that Libby had backed up to the bookshelves. She pulled a 
yellow plastic toy gun from her backpack. 

“Libby—what are you doing?” I whispered. “That’s just a toy!” 

“I know,” she whispered back. “But this is a comic book—right? It can’t be 
real. So if it’s a comic book, we can do anything !” 

She raised the plastic toy pistol and aimed it at The Masked Mutant. 

He let out a cold laugh. “What do you plan to do with that toy?” he asked 
scornfully. 

“It only l-looks like a toy,” Libby stammered. “It’s a Molecule-Melter. 
Leave this room—or I’ll melt all your molecules!” 

The Mutant’s smile grew wider. “Nice try,” he said, flashing two rows of 
perfect, white teeth. 

He narrowed his eyes at Libby and took another step toward her. “I guess 
you want to go first. I’ll try not to hurt you—too much.” 

Libby held the toy gun in front of her with both hands. She gritted her teeth, 
preparing to pull the trigger. 

“Put down that toy. It can’t help you,” The Masked Mutant declared, 
moving closer. 

“I’m not kidding,” Libby insisted in a shrill voice. “It isn’t a toy. It really is 
a Molecule-Melter.” 

The Masked Mutant laughed again and took another step closer. Then 
another step. 

Libby aimed the gun at The Mutant’s chest. She pulled the trigger. 

A high-pitched whistle burst out of the gun. 

The Masked Mutant took another step closer. Then another. 



26 


Libby lowered the plastic gun. 

We both stared in horror as The Masked Mutant came nearer. 

He took one more step. Then stopped. 

A bright white light circled his body. The light became a crackling electrical 
current. 

The Mutant uttered a low moan. Then he began to melt. 

His head melted down into his mask. Tinier and tinier—until it disappeared 
completely. The empty mask slumped on to the shoulders of his costume. And 
then the rest of his body melted away, shrinking until there was nothing left but a 
wrinkled costume and cape, heaped on the carpet. 

Libby and I stood staring down at the costume in silence. 

“It—it worked!” I finally managed to choke out. “The toy gun—it worked, 
Libby!” 

“Of course,” she replied with surprising calm. 

She walked over to the empty costume and kicked it with her sneaker. “Of 
course it worked. I warned him it was a Molecule-Melter. He wouldn’t listen.” 

My brain was doing flip-flops. I didn’t really understand. It was just a toy 
pistol. Why did it destroy the mightiest mutant on Earth? 

“Let’s get out of here!” I pleaded, starting toward the door. 

Libby moved to block my path. “I’m sorry, Skipper,” she said softly. 

“Sorry? What do you mean?” 

She raised the plastic pistol and aimed it at me. “I’m sorry,” she said, 
“because you’re disappearing next.” 



27 


At first I thought Libby was joking. “Libby, put down the gun,” I told her. “You 
have a sick sense of humor!” 

She kept the plastic gun aimed at my chest. 

I let out a feeble laugh. 

But I quickly cut it short when I saw the hard expression on her face. 
“Libby—what’s your problem?” I demanded. 

“I’m not Libby,” she replied softly. “I hate to break the news to you, 
Skipper—but there is no Libby.” 

As she said those words, she began to change. Her red hair slid into her 
head. Her cheeks grew wider. Her nose lengthened. Her eyes changed from 
green to black. 

She stretched up, growing taller. Muscles bulged on her skinny arms. And 
as she grew, her clothing changed, too. Her jeans and T-shirt appeared to melt 
away—replaced by a familiar-looking costume. 

The costume of The Masked Mutant. 

“Libby—what’s going on?” I cried in a tiny, frightened voice. I still didn’t 
understand. “How are you doing that?” 

She shook her head. “You don’t catch on very fast, do you?” she said, 
rolling her eyes. Her voice came out deep and booming. A man’s voice. 

“Libby, I—” 

She swept her cape behind her. “I’m The Masked Mutant, Skipper. I 
changed my molecules into a girl your age and called myself Libby. But I’m The 
Masked Mutant.” 

“But—but—but—” I sputtered. 

She tossed the toy gun aside and grinned at me triumphantly. 

“But you just melted The Masked Mutant!” I cried. “We both saw him 
melt!” 

She shook her head. “No. You’re mistaken. I just melted The Magnificent 
Molecule Man.” 

I gaped at her in astonishment. “Huh? Molecule Man?” 

“He worked for me,” she explained, glancing down at the crumpled, empty 
costume on the floor. “Sometimes I ordered him to dress like me. To keep people 



off my track.” 

“He worked for you—and you melted him?” I cried. 

“I’m a villain,” The Masked Mutant replied, smiling. “I do very bad things 
—remember?” 

It all started to come clear. There never was a Libby. It had been The 
Masked Mutant all along. 

The Masked Mutant stepped over the crumpled costume to move closer to 
me. Once again, I pressed my back against the wall. “Now I have no choice. 
Now I have to do something very bad to you, Skipper,” he said flatly, his black 
eyes staring hard into mine through his mask. 

“But—why?” I cried. “Why can’t I just leave? I’ll go straight home. I’ll 
never tell anyone about you. Really!” I pleaded. 

He shook his head. “I can’t let you leave. You belong here now.” 

“Huh?” I gasped. “What are you saying, Libby—I mean, Mutant?” 

“You belong here now, Skipper,” he replied coldly. “I knew it when I saw 
you on the bus for the first time. I knew you were perfect when you told me you 
knew everything about my comics.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered again. 

“It’s so hard to find good characters for my stories, Skipper. It’s so hard to 
find good foes. I’m always looking for new faces. That’s why I was so pleased 
when I discovered you.” 

His evil grin grew wider. “Then when you recognized my headquarters 
building, I knew you were right. I knew you were ready to star in a story.” 

The smile faded quickly. “I’m so sorry, Skipper. But the story is over. Your 
part has come to an end.” 

“What—what are you going to do?” I stammered. 

“Destroy you, of course!” The Mutant replied coldly. 

I pressed my back against the wall. I stared back at him, thinking hard. 

“Good-bye, Skipper,” The Masked Mutant said softly. 

“But you can’t do this!” I screamed. “You’re just a character in a comic 
book! But I’m real! I’m a real, live person! I’m a real boy!” 

A strange smile formed on The Mutant’s lips. “No, you’re not, Skipper,” he 
said, snickering. “You’re not real. You’re just like me now. You’re a comic book 
character, too.” 



28 


I pinched my arm. It felt as warm and real as always. 

“You’re a liar!” I shouted. 

The Masked Mutant nodded. A pleased smile formed on his face. “Yes, I’m 
a liar,” he agreed. “That’s one of my better qualities.” His smile faded. “But I’m 
not lying this time, Skipper. You’re not real anymore.” 

I refused to believe him. “I feel the way I always have,” I declared. 

“But I changed you into a comic book character,” he insisted. “Remember 
when you entered this building for the first time? Remember when you walked 
through the glass door and a beam of light passed over you?” 

I nodded. “Yes. I remember that,” I muttered. 

“Well, that was a scanner,” The Masked Mutant continued. “When you 
stepped through it, it scanned your body. It turned you into tiny dots of ink.” 

“No!” I shouted. 

He ignored my cry. “That’s all you are now, Skipper. Tiny dots of red, blue, 
and yellow ink. You’re a comic book character, just like me.” 

He slid toward me menacingly, his cape spreading out behind him. “But I’m 
sorry to say you’ve made your last appearance in my comic book. Or in any 
comic book.” 

“Wait!” I cried. 

“I can’t wait any longer,” The Masked Mutant replied coldly. “I’ve already 
wasted too much time on you, Skipper.” 

“But I’m not Skipper!” I declared. 

“I’m not Skipper Matthews,” I said. “There is no Skipper Matthews.” 

“Oh, really?” he asked, rolling his eyes. “Then who are you?” 

“I’m The Colossal Elastic Boy!” I replied. 



29 


The Masked Mutant uttered a low gasp. “Elastic Boy!” he exclaimed. “I thought 
you looked familiar!” 

“Good-bye, Mutant,” I said in a deep voice. 

“Where are you going?” he asked sharply. 

“Back to my home planet of Xargos,” I replied, starting toward the door. 
“I’m not allowed to guest-star in other comic books.” 

He moved quickly to block the door. “Nice try, Elastic Boy,” he said. “But 
you have invaded my secret headquarters. I have to destroy you.” 

I laughed. “You can’t destroy Elastic Boy!” I boasted. “I’ll stretch out my 
elastic arms and wrap you in them, and squeeze you into Play-Doh!” 

“I don’t think so,” The Masked Mutant replied dryly. He let out an angry 
growl. “I’m tired of all this talk, talk, talk. I’m going to tear you to pieces—and 
then tear your pieces into tiny pieces!” 

I laughed again. “No way!” I told him. “I’m elastic, remember? I can’t be 
torn into pieces. I bend—but I don’t break! There’s only one way that Elastic 
Boy can be destroyed!” 

“What’s that?” The Masked Mutant asked. 

“By sulphuric acid,” I replied. “That’s the only thing that can destroy my 
elastic body!” 

A pleased smile spread behind the masked face. 

“Oops!” I cried. “I didn’t mean to let that slip out!” 

I tried to make it to the door. But I wasn’t fast enough. 

I saw The Masked Mutant quickly begin to change. He changed into a 
steaming hot wave of sulphuric acid. 

And before I could move, the tall wave of acid swept toward me. 



30 


With a loud cry, I leaped away. 

The tall wave swept past. It missed me by inches. 

I turned and watched it splash over the carpet. The carpet began to sizzle 
and burn. 

“Yes!” I shouted gleefully. “Yes!” 

I had never felt so happy, so strong, so triumphant! 

I had defeated The Masked Mutant. I had totally tricked him. I had 
destroyed the most evil supervillain ever to walk the planet! 

Me! A twelve-year-old boy named Skipper Matthews! I had sent The 
Masked Mutant to his doom! 

Such a simple trick. But it had worked. 

From reading the comics, I knew that The Masked Mutant could change his 
molecules into anything solid. And then change back again. 

But I tricked him into changing himself into a liquid ! And once he changed 
into a liquid, he could not re-form himself. 

The Masked Mutant was gone forever. 

“Skipper, you are a clever guy!” I shouted out loud. I was so happy, I did a 
little dance on the thick carpet. 

I couldn’t believe The Masked Mutant had believed that I was Elastic Boy. 
I’d made that name up. I’ve never heard of any Elastic Boy! 

But he fell for it. And now the evil supervillain is gone! I thought happily. 

And I am alive! Alive! 

I couldn’t wait to get home and see my family again. The bus ride seemed 
to take hours. 

Finally, I was running up my front lawn. Into the house through the front 

door. 

I immediately saw a brown envelope lying on the mail table. The new issue 
of The Masked Mutant. 

Who needs it? I asked myself. 

I ignored it and hurried to say hi to my parents. I was so glad to be home, I 
was even happy to see Mitzi. “Mitzi—how about a game of Frisbee?” I asked. 



“Huh?” She gaped at me in shock. I never want to play anything with my 
little sister. 

But, today, I just wanted to be happy and celebrate being alive. 

Mitzi and I hurried out to the back yard. We threw a Frisbee around for 
about half an hour. We had a great time. 

“How about a snack?” I asked her. 

“Yeah. I’m starving,” she replied. “Mom left some chocolate cake on the 
counter.” 

Chocolate cake sounded just right. 

Humming happily to myself, I trotted into the kitchen. I pulled down two 
plates from the cabinet. Then I found the big cake knife in the drawer. 

“Don’t make your slice bigger than mine!” Mitzi warned, watching me 
carefully as I prepared to cut the cake. 

“Mitzi, I promise I won’t cheat you,” I said sweetly. I was in such a good 
mood, even Mitzi couldn’t get me upset. 

“This looks like awesome chocolate cake!” I exclaimed. 

I slid the big knife over the cake. 

It slipped. 

“Ow!” I cried out as the knife blade cut the back of my hand. 

I raised my hand and stared down at the cut. “Hey!” I uttered in surprise. 

What was trickling out from the cut? 

Not blood. 

It was red, blue, yellow, and black. 

INK! 

“Cool!” Mitzi cried. 

“Where’s that new Masked Mutant comic?” I asked. I suddenly had the 
feeling that my comic book career wasn’t over! 



MY HAIRIEST ADVENTURE 
Goosebumps - 26 
R.L. Stine 



1 


Why were there so many stray dogs in my town? 

And why did they always choose me to chase? 

Did they wait quietly in the woods, watching people go by? Then did 
they whisper to each other, “See that blond kid? That’s Larry Boyd—let’s 
go get him”? 

I ran as fast as I could. But it’s so hard to run when you’re carrying a 
guitar case. It kept banging against my leg. 

And I kept slipping in the snow. 

The dogs were catching up. They were howling and barking, trying to 
scare me to death. 

Well, it’s working, guys! I thought. I’m scared. I’m plenty scared! 

Dogs are supposed to sense when you’re afraid of them. But I’m not 
usually afraid of dogs. In fact, I really like dogs. 

I’m only afraid of dogs when there’s a pack of them, running furiously 
after me, drooling hungrily, eager to tear me to tiny shreds. Like now. 

Scrambling over the snow, I nearly toppled into a drift up to my knees. 
I glanced back. The dogs were gaining on me. 

It isn’t fair! I thought bitterly. They have four legs, and I only have 

two! 

The big black dog with the evil black eyes was leading the pack, as 
usual. He had his lips pulled back in an angry snarl. He was close enough 
so that I could see his sharp, pointy teeth. 

“Go home! Go home! Bad dogs! Go home!” 

Why was I yelling at them? They didn’t even have homes! 

“Go home! Go home!” 

My boots slipped in the snow, and the weight of my guitar case nearly 
pulled me over. Somehow I staggered forward, caught my balance, and kept 
moving. 

My heart was pounding like crazy. And I felt as if I were burning up, 
even though it was about twelve degrees. 

I squinted against the bright glare of the snow. I struggled to run faster, 
but my leg muscles were starting to cramp. 



I don’t stand a chance! I realized. 

“Ow!” The heavy guitar case bounced against my side. 

I glanced back. The dogs were leaping excitedly, making wide 
crisscrosses across the yards, howling and yowling, as they scrambled after 
me. 

Moving closer. And closer. 

“Go home! Bad dogs! Bad! Go home!” 

Why me? 

I’m a nice guy. Really. Ask anybody. They’ll tell you—Larry Boyd is 
the nicest twelve-year-old kid in town! 

So why did they always chase me? 

The last time, I dived into a parked car and shut the door just as they 
pounced. But today, the dogs were too close. And the cars along the street 
were all snow-covered. By the time I got a car door open, the dogs would 
be having me for dessert! 

I was only half a block from Lily’s house. I could see it on the corner 
across the street. It was my only chance. 

If I could get to Lily’s house, I could—“NOOOOOOOO!” 

I slipped on a small rock, hidden under the snow. The guitar case flew 
from my hand and hit the snow with a soft thud. 

I was down. Facedown in the snow. 

“They’ve got me this time,” I moaned. “They’ve got me.” 



2 


Everything went white. 

I struggled to my knees, frantically brushing snow off my face with 
both hands. 

The dogs barked hungrily. 

“Scat! Get away! Get going!” Another voice. A familiar voice. “Get 
going, dogs! Get away!” 

The barking grew softer. 

I brushed the wet snow from my eyes. “Lily!” I cried happily. “How 
did you get here?” 

She swung a heavy snow shovel in the dogs’ direction. “Scat! Go 
away! Go!” 

The growls turned to low whimpers. The dogs backed up, started to 
retreat. The huge black dog with the black eyes lowered his head and loped 
slowly away. The others followed. 

“Lily—they’re listening to you!” I cried thankfully. I climbed slowly 
to my feet and brushed the snow off the front of my blue down parka. 

“Of course,” she replied, grinning. “I’m tough, Larry. I’m real tough.” 

Lily Vonn doesn’t exactly look tough. She’s twelve like me, but she 
looks younger. She’s short and thin and kind of cute. She has chin-length 
blond hair with bangs that go straight across her forehead. 

The strange thing about Lily is her eyes. One is blue and one is green. 
No one can really believe she has two different colors—until they see them. 

I brushed most of the snow off the front of my coat and the knees of 
my jeans. Lily handed me my guitar case. “Hope it’s waterproof,” she 
muttered. 

I raised my eyes to the street. The dogs were barking wildly again, 
chasing a squirrel through several front yards. 

“I saw you from my window,” Lily said as we started toward her 
house. “Why do they always chase after you?” 

I shrugged. “I was just asking myself the same question,” I told her. 
Our boots made crunching noises in the snow. Lily led the way. I stepped in 
her bootprints. 



We waited for a car to move past, its tires sliding on the slick road. 
Then we crossed the street and made our way up her driveway. 

“How come you’re late?” Lily asked. 

“I had to help my dad shovel the drive,” I replied. Some snow had 
caught inside my hood and was trickling down the back of my neck. I 
shivered. I couldn’t wait to get inside the house. 

The others were all hanging out in Lily’s living room. I waved hi to 
Manny, Jared, and Kristina. Manny was down on his knees, fiddling with 
his guitar amp. It made a loud squeal, and everybody jumped. 

Manny is tall and skinny and kind of goofy-looking, with a crooked 
smile and a mop of curly, black hair. Jared is twelve like the rest of us, but 
he looks eight. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him without his black-and-silver 
Raiders cap on. Kristina is a little chubby. She has curly, carrot-colored hair 
and wears glasses with blue plastic frames. 

I tugged off my wet coat and hung it on a peg in the front entryway. 
The house felt steamy and warm. I straightened my sweatshirt and joined 
the others. 

Manny glanced up from his amp and laughed. “Hey, look—Larry’s 
hair is messed up. Somebody take a picture!” 

Everybody laughed. 

They’re always teasing me about my hair. Can I help it if I have really 
good hair? It’s dark blond and wavy, and I wear it long. 

“Hairy Larry!” Lily declared. 

The other three laughed and then picked up the chant. “Hairy Larry! 
Hairy Larry! Hairy Larry!” 

I made an angry face and swept my hand back through my hair, 
pushing it off my forehead. I could feel myself blushing. 

I really don’t like being teased. It always makes me angry, and I 
always blush. 

I guess that’s why Lily and my other friends tease me so much. They 
tease me about my hair, and about my big ears, and about anything else they 
can think of. 

And I always get angry. And I always blush. Which makes them tease 
me even more. 

“Hairy Larry! Hairy Larry! Hairy Larry!” 

Great friends, huh? 



Well, actually, they are great friends. We have a lot of fun together. 
The five of us have a band. This week, it’s called The Geeks. Last week, we 
called ourselves The Spirit. We change the name a lot. 

Lily has a gold coin that she wears on a chain around her neck. Her 
grandfather gave the coin to her. He told her it’s real pirate gold. 

So Lily wants to call our band Pirate Gold. But I don’t think that’s cool 
enough. And Manny, Jared, and Kristina agree. 

At least our name—The Geeks—is a lot cooler than Howie and the 
Shouters. That’s the band who’s challenging us in the big Battle of the 
Bands contest at school. 

We still can’t believe that Howie Hurwin named the band after 
himself! He’s only the drummer. His stuck-up sister, Marissa, is the singer. 
“Why didn’t you call it Marissa and the Shouters?” I asked him one day 
after school. 

“Because Marissa doesn’t rhyme with anything,” he replied. 

“Huh? What does Howie rhyme with?” I asked him. 

“Zowie!” he said. Then he laughed and messed up my hair. 

What a creep. 

No one likes Howie or his sister. The Geeks can’t wait to blow the 
Shouters off the stage. 

“If only one of us played bass,” Jared moaned as we tuned up. 

“Or saxophone or trumpet or something,” Kristina added, pulling out a 
couple of pink guitar picks from her open case. 

“I think we sound great,” Manny said, still down on the floor, fiddling 
with the cord to his amp. “Three guitars is a great sound. Especially when 
we put on the fuzztone and crank them all the way up.” 

Kristina, Manny, and I all play guitar. Lily is the singer. And Jared 
plays a keyboard. His keyboard has a drum synthesizer with ten different 
rhythms on it. So we also have drums. Kind of. 

As soon as Manny got his amp working, we tried to play a Rolling 
Stones song. Jared couldn’t find the right drum rhythm on his synthesizer. 
So we played without it. 

As soon as we finished, I shouted, “Let’s start again!” 

The others all groaned. “Larry, we sounded great!” Lily insisted. “We 
don’t need to play it again.” 

“The rhythm was way off,” I said. 



“You’re way off!” Manny exclaimed, making a face at me. 

“Larry is a perfectionist,” Kristina said. “Did you forget that, Manny?” 

“How could I forget?” Manny groaned. “He never lets us finish one 
song!” 

I could feel myself blushing again. “I just want to get it right,” I told 
them. 

Okay. Okay. Maybe l am a perfectionist. Is that a bad thing? 

“The Battle of the Bands is in two weeks,” I said. “We don’t want to 
get onstage and embarrass ourselves, do we?” 

I just hate being embarrassed. I hate it more than anything in the 
world. More than steamed broccoli! 

We started playing again. Jared hit the saxophone button on his 
keyboard, and it sounded as if we had a saxophone. Manny took the first 
solo, and I took the second. 

I messed up one chord. I wanted to start again. 

But I knew they’d murder me if I stopped. So I kept on playing. 

Lily’s voice cracked on a high note. But she has such a sweet, tiny 
voice, it didn’t sound too bad. 

We played without taking a break for nearly two hours. It sounded 
pretty good. Whenever Jared found the right drum rhythm, it sounded really 
good. 

After we put our instruments back in their cases, Lily suggested we go 
outside and mess around in the snow. The afternoon sun was still high in a 
shimmery blue sky. The thick blanket of snow sparkled in the golden 
sunlight. 

We chased each other around the snow-covered evergreen shrubs in 
Lily’s front yard. Manny crushed a big, wet snowball over Jared’s Raiders 
cap. That started a snowball fight that lasted until we were all gasping for 
breath and laughing too hard to toss any more snow. 

“Let’s build a snowman,” Lily suggested. 

“Let’s make it look like Larry,” Kristina added. Her blue-framed 
glasses were completely steamed up. 

“Whoever heard of a snowman with perfect blond hair?” Lily replied. 

“Give me a break,” I muttered. 

They started to roll big balls of snow for the snowman’s body. Jared 
shoved Manny over one of the big snowballs and tried to roll him up in the 



ball. But Manny was too heavy. The whole thing crumbled to powder under 
him. 

While they worked on the snowman, I wandered down to the street. 
Something caught my eye at the curb next door. 

A pile of junk standing next to a metal trash Dumpster. 

I glanced up at the neighbors’ house. I could see that it was being 
remodeled. The pile of junk at the curb was waiting to be carted away. 

I leaned over the side of the Dumpster and began shuffling through the 
stuff. I love old junk. I can’t help myself. I just love pawing through piles of 
old stuff. 

Leaning into the Dumpster, I shoved aside a stack of wall tiles and a 
balled-up shower curtain. Beneath a small, round, shag rug, I found a white 
enamel medicine chest. 

“Wow! This is cool!” I murmured to myself. 

I pulled it up with both hands, moved away from the Dumpster, and 
opened the chest. To my surprise, I found bottles and plastic tubes inside. 

I started to examine them, moving them around with my hand, when 
an orange bottle caught my eye. “Hey, guys!” I shouted up to my friends. 
“Look what I found!” 



3 


I carried the orange bottle back up to Lily’s yard. “Hey, guys—look!” I 
called, waving the bottle. 

No one looked up. Manny and Jared were struggling to lift one big 
snowball and set it on the other one to form the snowman’s body. Lily was 
shouting encouragement. Kristina was wiping snow off her glasses with one 
of her gloves. 

“Hey, Larry—what’s that?” Kristina finally asked, putting her glasses 
back on. The others turned and saw the bottle in my hand. 

I read the label to them: “INSTA-TAN. Rub on a dark suntan in 
minutes.” 

“Cool!” Manny declared. “Let’s try it.” 

“Where did you find it?” Lily demanded. Her cheeks were bright red 
from the cold. There were white flecks of snow in her bangs. 

I pointed to the Dumpster. “Your neighbors threw it out. The bottle is 
full,” I announced. 

“Let’s try it!” Manny repeated, grinning his crooked grin. 

“Yeah. Let’s all go into school on Monday with dark suntans!” Kristina 
urged. “Can you see the look on Miss Shindling’s face? We’ll tell her we all 
went to Florida!” 

“No! The Bahamas!” Lily declared. “We’ll tell Howie Hurwin that The 
Geeks went to the Bahamas to practice!” 

Everyone laughed. 

“Do you think the stuff works?” Jared asked, adjusting his cap and 
staring at the bottle. 

“It has to,” Lily said. “They couldn’t sell it if it didn’t work.” She 
grabbed the bottle from my hand. “It’s nearly full. We can all get great tans. 
Come on. Let’s do it. It’ll be so cool!” 

We all followed Lily back into the house, our boots crunching over the 
snow, our breath steaming up above our heads. 

I pulled off my coat and tossed it onto the pile with the others. As I 
made my way into the living room, I began to have second thoughts. What 
if the stuff doesn’t work? I asked myself. What if it turns us bright yellow 



or green instead of tan? 

I’d be so totally embarrassed if I had to show up at school with bright 
green skin. I couldn’t do it. I just couldn’t. Even if it took months, I’d hide 
in my house—in my closet—till the stuff wore off. 

The others didn’t seem to be worried. 

We jammed into the downstairs bathroom. Lily still had the bottle of 
INSTA-TAN. She twisted off the cap and poured a big glob of it into her 
hand. It was a creamy white liquid. 

“Mmmmm. Smells nice,” Lily reported, raising her hand to her face. 
“Very sweet-smelling.” 

She began rubbing it on her neck, then her cheeks, then her forehead. 
Tilting the bottle, she poured another big puddle into her palm. Then she 
mbbed the liquid over the backs of both hands. 

Manny took the INSTA-TAN bottle next. He splashed a big glob of it 
into his hand. Then he started rubbing it all over his face. 

“Leels cool and creamy,” Kristina reported when her turn came. Jared 
went next. He practically emptied the bottle as he rubbed the stuff on his 
face and neck. 

Linally it was my turn. I took the bottle and started to tilt it into my 
palm. 

But something made me stop. I hesitated. I could see that the others 
were all watching me, waiting for me to splash the liquid all over my skin, 
too. 

But, instead, I turned the bottle over and read the tiny print on the 
label. 

And what I read made me gasp out loud.

“Larry, what’s your problem?” Lily demanded. “Just pour a little in your 
hand and rub it on.” 

“But—but—but—” I sputtered. 

“Do I look darker?” Kristina asked Lily. “Is it working?” 

“Not yet,” Lily told her. She turned back to me. “What’s wrong, 
Larry?” 

“The 1-label,” I stammered. “It says ‘Do not use after February, 
1991.’” 

Everyone laughed. Their laughter rang off the tile walls in the narrow 
bathroom. 

“It can’t hurt you,” Lily said, shaking her head. “So what if the stuff is 
a little old? That doesn’t mean it will make your skin fall off!” 

“Don’t wimp out,” Manny said, grabbing the bottle and tilting the top 
toward my hand. “Go ahead. Pour it. We’ve all done it, Larry. Now it’s your 
turn.” 

“I think my skin is starting to tan,” Kristina said. She and Jared were 
admiring themselves in the mirror over the sink. 

“Go ahead, Larry,” Lily urged. “Those dates on the labels don’t mean 
anything.” She shoved my arm. “Put it on. What could happen?” 

I could see that they were all staring at me now. My face grew hot, and 
I knew that I was blushing. 

I didn’t want them to call me a wimp. I didn’t want to be the only one 
to chicken out. Sol tilted the bottle down and poured the last sticky glob of 
the liquid into the palm of my hand. 

Then I splashed it onto my face and rubbed it all over. I covered my 
face, my neck, and the back of my hands. It felt cool and creamy. And it did 
have a sweet smell, a little like my dad’s aftershave. 

The others cheered when I finished rubbing the cream in. “Way to go, 
Larry!” Jared clapped me on the back so hard, I nearly dropped the empty 
INSTA-TAN bottle. 

We all pushed and shoved, struggling to get a good view of ourselves 
in the small medicine chest mirror. Manny gave Jared a hard shove and sent 



him sprawling into the shower. 

“How long is it supposed to take?” Kristina asked. The bright ceiling 
light reflected off her glasses as she studied herself in the mirror. 

“I don’t think it’s working at all,” Lily said, letting out a disappointed 

sigh. 

I studied the label again. “It says we should have a dark, good-looking 
tan almost instantly,” I reported. I shook my head. “I knew this stuff was 
too old. I knew we shouldn’t have—” 

Manny’s shrill scream cut off my words. We all turned to him and saw 
his horrified expression. 

“My face!” Manny shrieked. “My face! It’s falling off!” 

He had his hands cupped. They trembled as he held them up. And I 
saw that he was holding a pale blob of his own skin! 



5 


“Ohhhh.” A weak moan escaped my lips. 

The others stared down at Manny’s hands in silent horror. 

“My skin!” he groaned. “My skin!” 

And then a grin burst out over his face, and he started to laugh. 

As he held up his hand, I saw that it wasn’t a piece of pale skin at all. 
It was a wet, wadded-up tissue. 

Laughing his head off, Manny let the tissue float down to the bathroom 
floor. 

“You jerk!” Lily cried angrily. 

We all began shouting and shoving Manny. We pushed him into the 
shower. Lily reached for the knobs to turn on the water. 

“No—stop!” Manny pleaded, laughing hard, struggling to break free. 
“Please! It was just a joke!” 

Lily changed her mind and backed away. We all took final glances into 
the mirror as we paraded out of the bathroom. 

No change. No tan. The stuff hadn’t worked at all. 

We grabbed our coats and hurried back outside to finish the snowman. 
I took the empty INSTA-TAN bottle with me and tossed it into the snow as 
Lily and Kristina rolled a snowball to make the head. Then they lifted it 
onto the snowman’s body. 

I found two dark stones for eyes. Manny grabbed Jared’s Raiders cap 
and placed it on the snowman’s head. It looked pretty good, but Jared 
quickly grabbed his cap back. 

“It looks a lot like you, Manny,” Jared said. “Except smarter.” 

We all laughed. 

A strong gust of wind whipped around the side of the house. The wind 
toppled the snowman’s head. It rolled off the body and crumbled to powder 
on the ground. 

“Now it really looks like you!” Jared told Manny. 

“Think fast!” Manny cried. He scooped up a big handful of snow and 
heaved it at Jared. 

Jared tried to duck. But the snow poured over him. He instantly bent 



down, scooped up an even bigger pile of snow, and dropped it over 
Manny’s head. 

This started a long, funny, snowball fight among the five of us. 
Actually, it turned out to be Lily and me against Manny, Jared, and Kristina. 

The two of us held our own for a while. Lily is the fastest snowball 
maker I ever saw. She can make one and throw it in the time it takes me to 
bend down and start rolling the snow between my gloves. 

The snowball fight quickly became a war. We weren’t even bothering 
to make snowballs. We were just heaving big handfuls of snow at each 
other. And then we started rolling in the snow. And then we chased each 
other to the next yard, where the snow was fresh—and started another 
heavy-duty snowball fight. 

What a great time! We were laughing and shouting, all breathing hard, 
all steaming hot despite the cold, swirling winds. 

And then suddenly I felt sick. 

I dropped to my knees, swallowing hard. The snow started to gleam 
brightly. Too brightly. The ground swayed and shook. 

I felt really sick. 

What’s happening to me? I wondered.

Dr. Murkin raised the long hypodermic needle. It gleamed in the light. A 
tiny droplet of green liquid spilled from the tip. 

“Take a deep breath and hold it, Larry,” the doctor instructed in his 
whispery voice. “This won’t hurt.” 

He said the same words every time I had to see him. 

I knew he was lying. The shot hurt. It hurt every time I got one, which 
was about every two weeks. 

He grabbed my arm gently with his free hand. He leaned close to me, 
so close I could smell the peppermint mouthwash on his breath. 

I took a deep breath and turned away. I could never bear to watch the 
long needle sink into my arm. 

“Ow!” I let out a low cry as the needle punctured the skin. 

Dr. Murkin tightened his grip on my arm. “That doesn’t hurt much, 
does it?” he asked, his voice just above a whisper. 

“Not too much,” I groaned. 

I glanced up at my mother. She was biting her lower lip, her face 
twisted in worry. She looked as if she were getting the shot! 

Finally, I felt the needle slide out. Dr. Murkin dabbed a cold, alcohol- 
soaked cotton ball against the puncture spot. “You’ll be okay now,” he said, 
patting my bare back. “You can put your shirt back on.” 

He turned and smiled reassuringly at my mother. 

Dr. Murkin is a very distinguished-looking man. I guess he’s about 
fifty or so. He has straight white hair that he slicks down and brushes 
straight back. He has friendly blue eyes behind square-shaped, black 
eyeglasses, and a warm smile. 

Even though he lies when he says the shot won’t hurt, I think he’s a 
really good doctor, and I like him a lot. He always makes me feel better. 

“Same old sweat gland problem,” he told my mother, writing some 
notes in my file. “He got overheated. And we know that’s not good—don’t 
we, Larry?” 

I muttered a reply. 

I have a problem with my sweat glands. They don’t work very well. I 



mean, I can’t sweat. So when I get really overheated, I start to feel sick. 

That’s why I have to see Dr. Murkin every two weeks. He gives me 
shots that make me feel better. 

Our snowball battle was a lot of fun. But out in the snow and cold 
wind, I didn’t even realize I was getting overheated. 

That’s why I started to feel weird. 

“Do you feel better now?” my mom asked as we made our way out of 
the doctor’s office. 

I nodded. “Yeah. I’m okay,” I told her. I stopped at the door and turned 
to face her. “Do I look any different, Mom?” 

“Huh?” She narrowed her dark eyes at me. “Different? How?” 

“Do I look like maybe I have a suntan or something?” I asked 
hopefully. 

Her eyes studied my face. “I’m a little worried about you, Larry,” she 
said quietly. “I want you to take a short nap when we get home. Okay?” 

I guessed that meant I didn’t look too tanned. 

I knew that INSTA-TAN wouldn’t work. The bottle was too old. And it 
probably didn’t work even when it was new. 

“It’s hard to get a suntan in the winter,” Mom commented as we 
headed across the snowy parking lot to the car. 

Tell me about it, I thought, rolling my eyes. 

Lily called me right after dinner. “I felt a little sick, too,” she admitted. “Are 
you okay?” 

“Yeah. I’m fine,” I replied. I held the cordless phone in one hand and 
flipped TV channels with the remote control in my other hand. 

It’s a bad habit of mine. Sometimes I flip channels for hours at a time 
and never really watch anything. 

“Howie and Marissa walked by after you left,” Lily said. 

“Did you massacre them?” I asked eagerly. “Did you bury them in 
snowballs?” 

Lily laughed. “No. We were all soaked and exhausted by the time 
Howie and Marissa showed up. We all just sort of stood there, shivering.” 

“Did Howie say anything about their band?” I asked. 

“Yeah,” Lily replied. “He said he bought an Eric Clapton guitar book. 
He said he’s learning some new songs that will blow us away.” 



“Howie should stick to drums. He is the worst guitar player in the 
world,” I muttered. “When he plays, the guitar actually squeaks ! I don’t 
know how he does it. How do you make a guitar squeak?” 

Lily laughed. “Marissa squeaks, too. But she calls it singing!” 

We both laughed. 

I cut my laughter short. “Do you think Howie and the Shouters are any 
good?” 

“I don’t know,” Lily replied thoughtfully. “Howie brags so much, you 
can’t really believe him. He says they’re good enough to make a CD. He 
says his dad wants them to make a demo tape so he can send it to all the big 
CD companies.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” I muttered sarcastically. “We should sneak over to 
Howie’s house some afternoon when they’re all practicing,” I suggested. 
“We could listen at the window. Check them out.” 

“Marissa is actually a pretty good singer,” Lily said. “She has a nice 
voice.” 

“But she’s not as good as you,” I said. 

“Well, I think we’re getting better,” Lily commented. Then she added, 
“It’s a shame we don’t have a real drummer.” 

I agreed. “Jared’s drum machine doesn’t always play the same song we 
play!” 

Lily and I talked about the Battle of the Bands a while longer. Then I 
said good night, turned off the phone, and sat down at my desk to start my 
homework. 

I didn’t finish until nearly ten. Yawning, I went downstairs to tell Mom 
and Dad I was going to sleep. Back upstairs, I changed into pajamas and 
crossed the hall to the bathroom to brush my teeth. 

Under the bright bathroom light, I studied my face in the mirror over 
the sink. No tan. My face stared back at me, as pale as ever. 

I picked up my toothbrush and spread a small line of blue toothpaste 

on it. 

I started to raise the toothbrush to my mouth—and then stopped. 

“Hey—!” I cried out. 

The toothbrush dropped into the sink as I gazed at the back of my 
hand. 

At first I thought the hand was covered by a dark shadow. 



But as I raised it closer to my face, I saw to my horror that it was no 
shadow. 

I let out a loud gulping sound as I stared at the back of my hand. 

It was covered by a patch of thick, black hair. 



7 


Staring down in shock, I shook the hand hard. I think I expected the black 
hair to fall off. 

I grabbed at it with my other hand and tugged it. 

“Ow!” 

The hair really was growing from the back of my hand. 

“How can this be?” I cried to myself. Holding the hand in the light, I 
struggled to stop it from trembling so that I could examine it. 

The hair was nearly half an inch high. It was shiny and black. Very 
spikey. Very prickly. It felt kind of rough as I rubbed my other hand over it. 

“Hairy Larry.” 

That dumb name Lily called me suddenly popped back into my head. 

“Hairy Larry.” 

In the mirror I could see my face turning red. They’ll call me Hairy 
Larry for the rest of my life, I thought unhappily, if they ever see this black 
hair growing out of my hand! 

I can’t let anyone see this! I told myself, feeling my chest tighten in 
panic. I can’t ! It would be so embarrassing! 

I examined my left hand. It was as smooth and clear as ever. 

“Thank goodness it’s only on one hand!” I cried. 

I tugged frantically at the patch of black hair again. I pulled at it until 
my hand ached. But the hair didn’t come out. 

My mouth suddenly felt dry. I gripped the edge of the sink with both 
hands, struggling to stop my entire body from trembling. 

“What am I going to do?” I murmured. 

Do I have to wear a glove for the rest of my life? 

I can’t let my friends see this. They’ll call me Hairy Larry forever. 
That’s how I’ll be known for the rest of my life! 

A panicky sob escaped my throat. 

Got to calm down, I warned myself. Got to think clearly. 

I was gripping the sink so tightly, my hands ached. I lifted them, then 
rolled up both pajama sleeves. 



Were my arms covered in black hair, too? 

No. 

I let out a long sigh of relief. 

The square patch of prickly hair on the back of my right hand seemed 
to be the only hair that had grown. 

What to do? What to do? 

I could hear my parents climbing the stairs, on their way to their 
bedroom. Quickly, I closed the bathroom door and locked it. 

“Larry—are you still up? I thought you went to bed,” I heard my mom 
call from out in the hall. 

“Just brushing my hair!” I called out. 

I brush my hair every night before I go to bed. 

I know it doesn’t make any sense. I know it gets messed up the instant 
I put my head down on the pillow. 

It’s just a weird habit. 

I raised my eyes to my hair. My dark blond hair, so soft and wavy. 

So unlike the disgusting patch of spikey black hair on my hand. 

I felt sick. My stomach hurtled up to my throat. 

I forced back my feeling of nausea and pulled open the door to the 
medicine chest. My eyes slid desperately over the bottles and tubes. 

Hair Remover. I searched for the words Hair Remover. 

There is such a thing—isn’t there? 

Not in our medicine cabinet. I read every jar, every bottle. No Hair 
Remover. 

I stared down at the black patch on my hand. Had the hair grown a 
little bit? Or was I imagining it? 

Another idea flashed into my mind. 

I pulled down my dad’s razor. On the bottom shelf of the medicine 
cabinet, I found a can of shaving cream. 

I’ll shave it all off, I decided. It will be easy. 

I’d watched my dad shave a million times. There was nothing to it. I 
started the hot water running in the sink. I splashed some onto the back of 
my hand. Then I rubbed the bar of soap over the bristly black hair until it 
got all lathery. 

My hands were wet and slippery, and the can of shaving cream nearly 
slid out of my grip. But I managed to push the top and spray a pile of white 



shaving cream onto the back of my hand. 

I smoothed it over the ugly black hair. Then I picked up the razor in 
my left hand, held it under the hot water, the way I’d seen Dad do it. 

And I started to shave. It was so hard to shave with my left hand. 

The razor blade slid over the thick patch. The bristly hair came right 
off. 

I watched it flow down the sink drain. 

Then I held my hand under the faucet and let the water rinse away the 
rest of the shaving cream lather. 

The water felt warm and soothing. I dried off my hand and then 
examined it carefully. 

Smooth. Smooth and clean. 

Not a trace of the disgusting black hair. 

Feeling a lot better, I put my dad’s razor and shaving cream back in the 
medicine chest. Then I crept across the hall to my bedroom. 

Rubbing the back of my hand, enjoying its cool smoothness, I clicked 
off the ceiling light and climbed into bed. 

My head sank heavily into the pillow. I yawned, suddenly feeling 
really sleepy. 

What had caused that ugly hair to grow? The question had been 
nagging at me ever since I discovered it. 

Was it the INSTA-TAN? Was it that old bottle of tanning lotion? 

I wondered if any of my friends had grown hair, too? I had to giggle as 
I pictured Manny covered in hair, like a big gorilla. 

But it wasn’t funny. It was scary. 

I rubbed my hand. Still smooth. The hair didn’t seem to be growing 
back. 

I yawned again, drifting to sleep. 

Oh, no. I’m itchy, I suddenly realized, half-awake, half-asleep. My 
whole body feels itchy. 

Is spikey black hair growing all over my body?

“Did you sleep?” Mom asked as I dragged myself into the kitchen for 
breakfast. “You look pale.” 

Dad lowered his newspaper to check me out. A white mug of coffee 
steamed in front of him. “He doesn’t look pale to me,” he muttered before 
returning to his newspaper. 

“I slept okay,” I said, sliding on to the stool at the breakfast counter. I 
studied my hand, keeping it under the counter just in case. 

No hair. It looked perfectly smooth. 

I had jumped out of bed the instant Mom called from downstairs. I 
turned on the light and studied my entire body in front of my dresser mirror. 

No black hair. 

I was so happy, I felt like singing. I felt like hugging Mom and Dad 
and doing a dance on the breakfast table. 

But that would be embarrassing. 

So I happily ate my Frosted Flakes and drank my orange juice. 

Mom sat down beside Dad and started to crack open a hard-boiled egg. 
She had a hard-boiled egg every morning. But she threw away the yellow 
and only ate the white. She said she didn’t want the cholesterol. 

“Mom and Dad, I have to tell you something. I did a pretty stupid 
thing yesterday. I found an old bottle of a cream called INSTA-TAN in a 
trash Dumpster. And my friends and I all rubbed it on ourselves. You know. 
So we’d have tans. But the date had run out on the bottle. And... well... 
last night, I suddenly grew some really gross black hair on the back of my 
hand.” 

That’s what I wanted to say. 

I wanted to tell them about it. I even opened my mouth to start telling 
them. But I couldn’t do it. 

I’d be so embarrassed. 

They would just start yelling at me and telling me what a jerk I was. 
They’d probably drag me off to Dr. Murkin and tell him what I had done. 
And then he would tell me how stupid I had been. 

So I kept my mouth shut. 



“You’re awfully quiet this morning,” Mom said, sliding a sliver of egg 
white into her mouth. 

“Nothing much to talk about,” I muttered. 

I ran into Lily on the way to school. She had her coat collar pulled up and a 
red-and-blue wool ski cap pulled down over her short blond hair. 

“It isn’t that cold!” I said, jogging to catch up with her. 

“Mom said it’s going down to ten,” Lily replied. “She made me bundle 

up.” 

The morning sun floated low over the houses, a red ball in the pale 
sky. The wind felt sharp. We leaned into it as we walked. A hard crust had 
formed over the snow, and our boots crunched loudly. 

I took a deep breath. I decided to ask Lily the big question on my 
mind. “Lily,” I started hesitantly. “Did any... uh... well... did any strange 
hair grow on the back of your hands last night?” 

She stopped walking and stared at me. A solemn expression darkened 
her face. “Yes,” she confessed in a hushed whisper. 



9 


“Huh?” I gasped. My heart skipped a beat. “You grew hair on your hand?” 

Lily nodded grimly. She moved closer. Her blue eye and her green eye 
stared at me from under the wool ski cap. 

“Hair grew on my hands,” she whispered, her breath steaming up the 
cold air as she talked. “Then it grew on my arms, and my legs, and my 
back.” 

I let out a choked cry. 

“Then my face changed into a wolf’s face,” Lily continued, still 
staring hard at me. “And I ran out to the woods and howled at the moon. 
Like this.” She threw back her head and uttered a long, mournful howl. 

“Then I found three people in the woods, and I ate them!” Lily 
declared. “Because I’m a werewolf !” 

She growled at me and snapped her teeth. And then she burst out 
laughing. 

I could feel my face turning red. 

Lily gave me a hard, playful shove. I lost my balance and nearly fell 
on to my back. 

She laughed even harder. “You believed me—didn’t you, Larry!” she 
accused. “You actually believed that dumb story!” 

“No way!” I cried. My face felt red-hot. “No way, Lily. Of course I 
didn’t believe you!” 

But I had believed her story. Up to the part where she said she ate 
three people. 

Then I finally figured out that she was joking, that she was teasing me. 

“Hairy Larry!” Lily chanted. “Hairy Larry!” 

“Stop it!” I insisted angrily. “You’re not funny, you know? You’re not 
funny at all!” 

“Well, you are!” she shot back. “Funny-looking!” 

“Ha-ha,” I replied sarcastically. I turned and crossed the street, taking 
long strides, trying to get away from her. 

“Hairy Larry!” she called, chasing after me. “Hairy Larry!” 

I slid on a patch of ice. I quickly caught my balance, but my backpack 



slid off my shoulder and dropped with a thud onto the street. 

As I bent to pick it up, Lily stood over me. “Did you grow hair last 
night, Larry?” she demanded. 

“Huh?” I pretended not to hear her. 

“Did you grow hair on the back of your hand? Is that why you asked 
me?” Lily asked, leaning over me. 

“No way,” I muttered. I hoisted the backpack onto my shoulder and 
started walking again. “No way,” I repeated. 

Lily laughed. “Are you a werewolf?” 

I pretended to laugh, too. “No. I’m a vampire,” I replied. 

I wished I could tell Lily the truth. I really wanted to tell her about the 
patch of ugly hair. 

But I knew she could never keep it a secret. I knew she would spread 
the story over the whole school. And then everyone I knew would call me 
Hairy Larry for the rest of my life! 

I felt bad about lying to her. I mean, she is my best friend. 

But what could I do? 

We walked the rest of the way to school without saying much. I kept 
glancing over at Lily. She had the strangest smile on her face. 

“Are you ready to present your book reports?” Miss Shindling asked. 

The classroom erupted with sounds—chairs scraping, Trapper-Keepers 
being opened, papers being rustled, throats being cleared. 

Standing in front of the entire class and reciting a book report makes 
everyone nervous. It makes me very nervous! I just hate having everyone 
stare at me. 

And if I goof up a word or forget what I want to say next, I always turn 
bright red. And then everyone laughs and makes fun of me. 

The night before, I had practiced my book report standing in front of 
the mirror. And I had done pretty well. Only a few tiny mistakes. 

Of course, I hadn’t been nervous giving the report to myself in my 
room. Now, my knees were shaking—and I hadn’t even been called on yet! 

“Howie, would you give your report first?” Miss Shindling asked, 
motioning for Howie Hurwin to come to the front of the class. 

“It’s a shame to have the best go first!” Howie replied, grinning. 

A few kids laughed. Other kids groaned. 



I knew that Howie wasn’t joking. He really thought he was the best at 
everything. 

He stepped confidently to the front of the room. Howie is a big guy, 
sort of chubby, with thick, brown hair that he never brushes, and a big, 
round face with freckles on his cheeks. 

He always has a smirk on his face. A stuck-up look that says, “I’m the 
best—and you’re an insect.” 

He usually wears baggy faded denim jeans about five sizes too big, 
and a long-sleeved T-shirt with a shiny black vest opened over it. 

He held up the book he was reporting on. One of the Matt Christopher 
baseball books. 

I groaned to myself. I knew in advance exactly what Howie was going 
to say: “I recommend this book to anyone who likes baseball.” 

That’s how Howie always started his book reports. So boring! 

But Howie always got A’s anyway. I never understood why Miss 
Shindling thinks he’s so terrific. 

Howie cleared his throat and grinned at Miss Shindling. Then he 
turned to the class and started his report in a loud, steady voice. “I 
recommend this book to anyone who likes baseball,” he began. 

Told you. 

I yawned loudly. No one seemed to notice. 

Howie droned on. “This is a very exciting book with a very good 
plot,” he said. “If you like a lot of excitement, you’ll like this book. 
Especially if you’re a baseball fan.” 

I didn’t hear the rest of it. I kept silently going over and over my own 
book report. 

A few minutes later, when Miss Shindling announced, “Larry, you’re 
next!” I almost didn’t hear her. 

I took a deep breath and climbed to my feet. Stay cool, Larry, I told 
myself. You’ve practiced and practiced your report. There’s nothing to be 
nervous about. 

Clearing my throat loudly, I started up the aisle to the front of the 
room. I was halfway up the aisle when Howie stuck out his foot. 

I saw his big grin—but I didn’t see his foot. 

“Oh!” I cried out in surprise as I stumbled over it—and went sprawling 
on the floor. 



The classroom exploded with laughter. 

My heart pounding, I started to pull myself up. 
But I stopped when I saw my hands. 

Both of them were bristling with thick, black hair. 



10 


“Larry, are you okay?” I heard Miss Shindling call from her desk. 

“Uh..I was too stunned to answer. 

“Larry, are you hurt?” 

“Uh... well...” I couldn’t speak at all. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t 
think. 

Crouched on the floor, I stared in horror at my hairy hands. 

Above me, I could hear kids still laughing about how Howie had 
tripped me. I glanced up to see the kid next to Howie slapping him a high- 
five. 

Ha-ha. Very funny. 

Usually, I’d be totally embarrassed. But I didn’t have time to be 
embarrassed. I was too scared. 

Had anyone seen my hairy hands? 

Still down on the floor, I glanced quickly around the room. 

No one was pointing in horror or crying out. 

Maybe no one had caught a glimpse of them yet. 

Quickly, I jammed both hands deep into my jeans pockets. 

When I was sure that both hands were completely hidden, I climbed 
slowly to my feet. 

“Look! Larry is blushing!” someone called from the back row. The 
room exploded with more laughter. 

Of course, that made me blush even redder. But blushing wasn’t 
exactly my biggest problem. 

There was no way I could stand in front of the class with these two 
hairy hands. I’d rather die! 

Without even thinking about it, I started hurrying back up the aisle to 
the classroom door. With my hands jammed into my jeans, it wasn’t easy to 
walk fast. 

“Larry—what’s wrong?” Miss Shindling called from the front of the 
room. “Where are you going?” 

“Uh... I’ll be right back,” I managed to choke out. 



“Are you sure you’re okay?” the teacher asked. 

“Yeah. Fine,” I mumbled. “Be right back. Really.” 

I knew everyone was staring at me. But I didn’t care. I just had to get 
out of there. I had to figure out what to do about my hands. 

As I reached the door, I heard Miss Shindling scold Howie. “You 
could have hurt Larry. You shouldn’t trip people, Howie. I’ve warned you 
before.” 

“But, Miss Shindling—it was an accident,” Howie lied. 

I slipped out the door. Into the long, empty hall. 

I checked to make sure no one was around to see me. Then I pulled my 
hands from my pockets. 

I had a dim hope that maybe my hands would be back to normal. But 
that hope vanished as soon as I raised them to the light. 

Thick, black hair—nearly an inch high!—covered both hands. How 
could it grow so fast? I wondered. 

The backs of my hands were hairy. And my palms were hairy, too. 
Hair poked up from the knuckles of my fingers. And clumps of black hair 
grew in the space between my fingers. 

I rubbed my hands together, as if trying to rub the ugly hair away. But 
of course it didn’t come off. 

“Nooooooo. Please—noooooo!” I moaned out loud without realizing 
it. 

What could I do? 

I couldn’t go back to class with these hairy monster hands. They would 
make everyone sickl 

I would be embarrassed for the rest of my life. Whenever anyone 
would see me coming, they’d say, “Here comes Hairy Larry Boyd. 
Remember that day the black hair grew all over his hands?” 

I’ll run home, I decided. I’ll get away from here. 

No. How could I leave school in the middle of the morning? Miss 
Shindling was waiting for me to return and give my book report. 

I stood frozen, my back against the tile wall, gazing at the hideous 
hands. 

And I suddenly realized that I wasn’t alone in the hallway. 

I glanced up—and gasped when I saw Mr. Fosburg, the principal. 

He was carrying a stack of textbooks. But he had stopped a few feet 



away from me. 

And he was staring in shock at my hairy hands. 



11 


I swung my hands down and tucked them behind my back. 

But it was too late. Mr. Fosburg had already seen them. His blue eyes 
narrowed as he studied me. 

I shuddered. 

What was he going to say? What was he going to do now? 

“Is it too cold in the building?” the principal asked. 

“Huh?” I replied. What was he asking? 

I leaned back against my hands, pressing them against the wall. Even 
through my shirt, I could feel the prickly hair all over them. 

“Should I have the furnace turned up, Larry?” Mr. Fosburg asked. “Is 
it too cold? Is that why you’re wearing gloves to class?” 

“G-gloves?” I stammered. 

He thought I was wearing gloves! 

“Yes. I... uh... was a little cold,” I told him, starting to feel a little 
better. “That’s why I went to my locker. For gloves.” 

He stared at me thoughtfully. Then he turned and headed the other 
way, balancing the stack of textbooks in both hands. “I’ll talk to the 
custodian about it,” he called back. 

I breathed a sigh of relief as he disappeared around the corner. That 
had been a close call. 

But he had given me a good idea. Gloves. 

I hurried to my locker. Turning the dial on the combination lock felt 
strange with my hairy fingers. But I opened the locker easily and pulled my 
black leather gloves from the pockets of my parka. 

A few seconds later, I stepped back into the classroom. Lily stood at 
the front of the class, giving her book report. She glanced at me curiously as 
I slid back into my seat. 

When Lily finished, Miss Shindling called me to the front of the room. 
“Are you okay now, Larry?” she asked. 

“Yes,” I replied. “My... uh... hands were cold.” I climbed out of my 
seat and stepped quickly to the front of the room. 

Some kids started to giggle and point at my gloves. But I didn’t care. 



At least no one could see my hands with the ugly black fur sprouting 
all over them. 

I took a deep breath and started my report. “The book I read is by 
Bruce Coville,” I began. 

“And I would recommend it to anyone who likes funny science fiction 
stories....” 

After school, I hurried to my locker. I kept my head down and tried to avoid 
everyone. 

I had worn the gloves all day. They were hot and uncomfortable. And 
they seemed to grow tighter and tighter. 

I wondered if the black hair on my hands was growing. But I was 
afraid to take off the gloves to check it out. 

I tugged on my parka and slung my backpack over one shoulder. I 
have to get out of here and think, I told myself. 

A few steps from the front exit, I heard Lily calling my name. I turned 
and saw her chasing after me. She was wearing an oversized yellow sweater 
pulled down over bright green tights. 

I kept walking. “Catch you later!” I called back to her. “I’m in a 
hurry.” 

But she came running up and stepped in front of me. “Aren’t you 
coming to band practice?” she asked. 

I was so upset about my hairy hands that I’d completely forgotten. 

“It’s at my house again this afternoon—remember?” Lily continued, 
walking backwards as I made my way to the doors. 

“I—I can’t,” I stammered. “I don’t feel very well.” 

That was the truth. 

She stared hard at me. “What’s your problem, Larry? How come 
you’ve been so weird all day?” 

“I just don’t feel well,” I insisted. “Sorry about the practice. Can we do 
it tomorrow?” 

“I guess,” she replied. She said something else, but I didn’t hear it. I 
pushed open the door and hurried out of the school. 

I ran all the way home. The sun beamed down on the snow, making it 
gleam like silver. It was beautiful, but I couldn’t enjoy it. I was lost in my 
own troubled thoughts. 



Thinking about hair. Thick patches of black, spikey hair. 

I burst into the house and tossed my backpack onto the floor. I started 
up the stairs to my room—but stopped when I heard Mom call my name. 

I found her in the living room, on the chair by the front window. She 
had Jasper, our cat, in her lap and the cordless phone up to her ear. She said 
something into it, then lowered it as she raised her eyes to me. 

“Larry, you’re home early. Don’t you have band practice?” 

“Not today,” I lied. “I have a lot of homework, so I came straight 
home.” Another lie. 

I didn’t want to tell her the truth. I didn’t want to tell her that I had 
mbbed INSTA-TAN all over myself and now I was sprouting disgusting 
black hair. 

I didn’t want to tell her. But it suddenly burst out of me. The whole 
story. I just couldn’t hold it in any longer. 

“Mom, you won’t believe this,” I started in a tiny, choked voice. “I’m 
growing hair, Mom. Really gross black hair. On my hands. You see, my 
friends and I—we found this old bottle of tanning lotion. And I know it was 
really stupid. But we all poured it on ourselves. I rubbed it all over my face, 
and hands, and neck. And now I’m growing hair, Mom. In school today, I 
looked down. And both of my hands were covered in black hair. I’m so 
embarrassed. And I’m scared, too. I’m really scared.” 

I was breathing hard as I finished the story. I had been staring down at 
the floor as I told it. But now I raised my eyes to see my mom’s reaction. 

What would she say? Could she help me? 



12 


I heard her mumble something. But I couldn’t understand the words. 

Then I realized that she wasn’t talking to me. 

She had the phone pressed to her ear, and she was talking into it. 

Mom had gone back to her telephone conversation. She was 
concentrating so hard, she hadn’t heard a word I had said! 

I let out an annoyed groan. Then I spun around and hurried up the 
stairs to my room. I closed the door behind me and tore off the hot, 
uncomfortable gloves. 

Jasper had run upstairs and perched on the window seat. She spent 
most of the day on the window seat in my room, staring down at the front 
yard. 

As I tossed the gloves onto a chair, she turned to me. Her bright yellow 
eyes glowed happily. 

I crossed the room and picked her up. Then I sat down on the window 
seat and hugged her. 

“Jasper, you’re the only real friend I have,” I whispered, petting her 
back. 

To my surprise, the cat let out a squawk, arched her back, and jumped 
to the floor. She ran halfway across the room, then turned back, her yellow 
eyes glaring at me. 

It took me a few seconds to realize the problem. I held up my hands. 
“It’s these hairy paws, isn’t it, Jasper?” I said sadly. “They frightened you— 
didn’t they?” 

The cat tilted her head, as if trying to understand me. 

“Well, they frighten me, too,” I told her. 

I jumped up and hurried across the hall to the bathroom. Once again, I 
pulled my dad’s shaving equipment from the medicine cabinet. 

I set to work, shaving off the thick hair. 

It wasn’t easy. Especially trying to shave off the tufts of hair that had 
grown in the spaces between my fingers. That hair was really hard to reach. 

The hair was stiff and tough. Like the bristles on a hairbrush. I cut 
myself twice, on the palm and the back of my right hand. 



As I rinsed the shaving cream off, I glanced down and saw Jasper 
staring up at me from the bathroom doorway. “Don’t tell Mom and Dad,” I 
whispered. 

She blinked her yellow eyes and yawned. 

The next morning, I awoke before Mom and Dad. Most mornings, I lie 
in bed and wait for Mom to shout that it’s time to get up. 

But this morning I jumped out of bed, turned on all the lights, and 
stepped up to my dresser mirror. 

Would I find new hair? 

I held up my hands and checked them out first. My eyes were still 
heavy from sleep. But I could see clearly that the hair had not grown back. 

“Yes!” I cried happily. 

The razor cuts on my right hand still hurt. But I didn’t care. Both 
hands were smooth and hairless. 

I turned them over and gazed at them for a long while. I was so glad 
they looked normal. 

I had dreamed about hair during the night. It had started out as 
spaghetti. In the dream, I was sitting in the kitchen, starting to eat a big 
plate of spaghetti. 

But as I started to twirl the noodles on my fork, they instantly turned to 
hair. Long, black hairs. 

I was twirling long, black hairs onto my fork. The plate was piled high 
with long strands of black hair. 

Then I raised the forkful of hair to my mouth. I opened my mouth. I 
brought the hairy fork up closer, closer. 

And then I woke up. 

Yuck! What a gross dream. 

I had felt really sick to my stomach. And it had been hard getting back 
to sleep. 

Now at last it was morning, and I continued my inspection. I leaned 
over and checked my feet. Then my legs. No black clumps of hair. 

No weird fur growing anywhere. 

I guess it’s safe to go to school, I told myself happily. But I’ll be sure 
to keep my gloves handy. 

After breakfast, I pulled on my coat, grabbed my backpack, and 
headed out of the house. 



It was a bright, warm day. The snow glistened wetly. The sunshine had 
started to melt it. I stepped carefully around puddles of slush as I walked 
along the sidewalk. 

I was feeling better. A lot better. In fact, I was feeling really good. 

Then I turned and saw that pack of dogs. Snarling dogs. Heading right 
for me. 



13 


My heart jumped up to my throat. The dogs were running full speed, their 
heads bobbing up and down, their eyes trained on me. They barked and 
growled furiously with each bounding step. 

My legs suddenly felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds. But I 
whirled around and forced myself to run. 

If they catch me, they’ll tear me to pieces! I told myself. They must 
smell Jasper on me, I decided. That’s why they always chase me. 

I loved my cat. But why did she have to get me in so much trouble? 

Who owned these vicious dogs, anyway? Why were they allowed to 
run wild like this? 

Questions, questions. They flew through my mind as I ran. Across 
front yards. Then across the street. 

A car horn blared. I heard the squeal of brakes. 

A car skidded toward the opposite curb. 

I had forgotten to check the traffic before I crossed. 

“Sorry!” I called. And kept running. 

A sharp pain in my side forced me to slow down. I turned and saw the 
yapping dogs racing steadily toward me. They crossed the street and kept 
moving over the snowy ground. Closer. Closer. 

“Hey, Larry!” Two kids stepped on to the sidewalk ahead of me. 

“Run!” I screamed breathlessly. “The dogs—” 

But Lily and Jared didn’t move. 

I stepped up to them, holding my side. It ached so hard, I could barely 
breathe. 

Lily turned to stare down the dogs, as she had done before. Jared 
stepped up to meet them. All three of us watched the dogs approach. 

Seeing the three of us standing together, the dogs slowed to a stop. The 
snarls and growls stopped instantly. They stared back at us uncertainly. 
They were panting hard, their tongues drooping down nearly to the snow. 

“Go home!” Lily shouted. She stamped her shoe hard on the sidewalk. 

The big black dog, the leader, uttered a low whimper and hung his 
head. 



“Go home! Go home!” All three of us chanted. 

The pain in my side started to fade. I felt a little better. The dogs 
weren’t going to attack, I could see. They didn’t want to tangle with all 
three of us. 

They turned and started to trot away, following the big black dog. 

Suddenly Jared started to laugh. “Look at that one!” he cried. He 
pointed to a long, scrawny dog with black, curly fur. 

“What’s so funny about that one?” I demanded. 

“He looks just like Manny!” Jared declared. 

Lily started to laugh. “You’re right! He does!” 

All three of us laughed. The dog had Manny’s curly hair. And he had 
Manny’s dark, soulful eyes. 

“Come on. We’ll be late,” Lily said. She kicked a hard clump of snow 
off the sidewalk. Jared and I followed her toward school. 

“Why were those dogs chasing you?” Jared asked. 

“I think because they smelled my cat,” I replied. 

“Those dogs are mean,” Lily said, a few steps ahead of us. “They 
shouldn’t let them run wild like that.” 

“Tell me about it,” I replied, rolling my eyes. 

A sharp gust of wind nearly blew us backwards over the slippery 
sidewalk. Jared’s Raiders cap went flying into the street. A station wagon 
rumbled past, nearly running it over. 

Jared darted into the street and snatched the cap back. “I’ll be glad 
when winter is over,” he muttered. 

We met Kristina in front of the school. Her red hair blew wildly 
around her head in the swirling wind. “Do we have band practice this 
afternoon?” she asked. She was chewing a Snickers bar. 

“Great breakfast,” I said sarcastically. 

“Mom didn’t have time to make eggs,” Kristina replied, chewing. 

“Yes. Practice at my house,” Lily said. “We’ve got to get to work, 
guys. We don’t want Howie to win the contest.” 

Kristina turned to me. “Where were you yesterday?” 

“I... uh... didn’t feel too well,” I replied. 

That reminded me of the INSTA-TAN lotion. Were any of my friends 
growing hair, too, because of that suntan gunk? I had to know. I had to ask. 

But if they weren’t growing hair—if I was the only one—then I’d be 



totally embarrassed. 

“Uh... remember that INSTA-TAN stuff?” I asked quietly. 

“Great stuff,” Jared replied. “I think it made me paler!” 

Kristina laughed. “It didn’t work at all. You were right, Larry. That 
bottle was too old.” 

“Look at us,” Lily added. “We’re all as pale as the snow. That stuff 
didn’t do anything.” 

But are you growing weird black patches of hair now? 

That’s what I was dying to ask. 

But none of them said anything about growing hair. 

Were they like me? Were they too embarrassed to admit it? 

Or was I the only one? 

I took a deep breath. Should I ask? Should I ask if anyone was 
sprouting hair? 

I opened my mouth to ask. But I stopped when I realized that the 
subject had changed. They were talking about our band again. 

“Can you bring your amp to my house?” Lily asked Kristina. “Manny 
will bring his. But it only has jacks to plug in two guitars.” 

“Maybe I can bring mine—” I started to say. 

But a gust of wind blew my parka hood back. 

I reached up to pull the hood back on my head. 

But my hand brushed the back of my neck—and I gasped. 

The back of my neck was covered with thick hair. 



14 


“Larry—what’s wrong?” Lily demanded. 

“Uh... uh...” I couldn’t speak. 

“What’s wrong with your scarf?” Jared asked. “Is it too tight?” He 
tugged at the wool scarf around my neck. 

The scratchy scarf my mom made me wear because my great-aunt 
Hildy had knitted it. 

I had forgotten I was wearing it. When my hand brushed against it, I’d 
thought... 

“You looked scared to death!” Lily exclaimed. “Are you okay, Larry?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. I’m okay,” I muttered, feeling my face go red. “The 
scarf was choking me, I guess.” What a lame lie. 

But I had to say something. I couldn’t say that I had mistakenly 
thought that my neck had sprouted fur! 

Larry, you’ve got to stop thinking about hair! I scolded myself. If you 
don’t, you’ll drive yourself crazy! 

I shivered. “Let’s go inside,” I said, wrapping the wool scarf tightly 
around my neck. 

I hurried to the boys’ room to brush my hair before the bell rang. Gazing at 
my wavy, blond hair in the mirror as I brushed it, I had a horrifying thought. 

What if my real hair suddenly fell out? And the gross, prickly black 
hair grew in its place? 

What if I woke up one morning, and my entire head was covered in the 
disgusting black fur? 

I took a long look at myself in the mirror. Someone had smeared soap 
over the glass, and my reflection appeared to stare back through hazy, white 
streaks. 

“Shape up,” I told myself. 

I pointed a finger at my reflection. A smooth, hairless finger. 

“Stop thinking about hair, Larry,” I instructed my reflection. “Stop 
thinking about it. You’re going to be okay.” 

The INSTA-TAN lotion has worn off, I decided. 



It had been several days since my friends and I had splashed it on 
ourselves. I had taken at least three showers and two baths. 

It wore off, I told myself. It’s all gone. Stop worrying about it. 

I took one last glance at my hair. It was getting pretty long, but I liked 
it that way. I liked brushing the sides back over my ears. 

Maybe I’ll let it grow really long, I thought. I tucked the hairbrush into 
my backpack and headed to class. 

I had a pretty good day until Miss Shindling handed back the history term 
papers. 

It wasn’t the grade that upset me. She gave me a ninety-four, which is 
really good. I knew that Lily would probably brag that she got a ninety- 
eight or a ninety-nine. But Lily was great at writing. 

A ninety-four was really excellent for me. 

The grade made me happy. But when I flipped through the pages, 
glancing over Miss Shindling’s comments on my writing, I found a black 
hair on page three. 

Was it my black hair? I wondered. Was it one of the disgusting black 
hairs that had sprouted on my hands? 

Or was it Miss Shindling’s? Miss Shindling had short, straight black 
hair. It could be one of hers. 

Or else... 

I squinted at the hair, afraid to touch it. 

I knew I was starting to get weird. I knew I had made a solemn vow 
that I was going to stop thinking about hair. 

But I couldn’t help it. 

Seeing this one, stubby little black hair stuck to the third page of my 
term paper gave me the shudders. Finally, I raised the term paper close to 
my face—and blew the hair away. 

I didn’t hear a word Miss Shindling said for the rest of the class. I was 
glad when the bell rang and it was time to go to gym. 

It will feel good to run around and get some exercise, I decided. 

“Basketball today!” Coach Rafferty shouted as we filed into the 
brightly lit gym. “Basketball today! Change into your shorts! Come on— 
hustle!” 

I usually don’t like basketball that much. There’s so much running 



back and forth. Back and forth the entire length of the floor. Also, I don’t 
have a very good shooting eye. And I get really embarrassed when a 
teammate passes me the ball and I miss an easy shot. 

But, today, basketball sounded just right. A chance to run and get rid of 
a lot of my nervous energy. 

I followed the other guys into the locker room. We all opened our gym 
lockers and pulled out our shorts and T-shirts. 

At the end of the row of lockers, Howie Hurwin kept shouting, “In 
your face! In your face!” 

Another guy snapped a towel at Howie. 

Serves him right, I thought. Howie is such a jerk. 

“In your face!” I heard Howie chant. Someone shouted to him to shut 
up. 

“In your face, man! In your face!” 

I sat down on the bench and pulled off my sneakers. Then I stood up 
and started to pull off my jeans. 

I stopped when I got the jeans about halfway down. 

I stopped and let out a low cry when I saw my knees. 

Bushy clumps of furry black hair had sprouted from both knees. 



15 


“How come you kept your jeans on in gym?” Jared asked. 

“Huh?” His question caught me by surprise. It was the next day, and 
we were walking along the slushy sidewalks, lugging our instruments to 
Lily’s house for another band practice. 

“You refused to change into gym shorts, remember?” Jared said, 
swinging his keyboard case at his side. 

“I... was just cold,” I told him. “My legs got cold. That’s all. I don’t 
know why Coach Rafferty gave me such a hard time.” 

Jared laughed. “Rafferty nearly swallowed his whistle when you sank 
that three-point jump shot from midcourt!” 

I laughed, too. I am the worst shot in school. But I was so crazed about 
my hairy knees, so totally pumped, that I played better than I’d ever played 
in my life. 

“Maybe you should wear jeans all the time!” Coach Rafferty had 
joked. 

But, of course, it was no joke. 

I ran all the way home after school and spent nearly half an hour 
locked in the upstairs bathroom, shaving the clumps of black hair off my 
knees. 

When I finally finished, both knees were red and sore. But at least they 
were smooth again. 

I spent the rest of the afternoon closed up in my room, thinking hard 
about what was happening to me. Unfortunately, all I came up with were 
questions. Dozens of questions. 

But no answers. 

Sprawled on my stomach on top of the bed, my knees throbbed as I 
thought. Why did my knees grow hair? I asked myself. I didn’t spread any 
INSTA-TAN on my knees. So why did the ugly black hair sprout there? 

Had the INSTA-TAN worked itself into my system? Had the strange 
liquid seeped into my pores? Had it spread through my entire body? 

Was I going to turn into some kind of big, hairy creature? Was I soon 
going to look like King Kong or something? 



Questions—but no answers. 

The questions still troubled me as I crossed the street with Jared, and 
Lily’s white-frame house came into view on the corner. 

The sun beamed down above the two bare maple trees that leaned over 
Lily’s driveway. The air felt warm, almost like spring. The snow had melted 
a lot in one day. Patches of wet grass poked up through the white. 

In the yard across the street from Lily’s house, a half-melted snowman 
looked sad and droopy. My hightops splashed through the slushy puddles as 
Jared and I carried our instruments up the driveway. 

Lily opened the door for us. She and Kristina had already been 
practicing. Lily was wearing a bright red-and-blue ski sweater pulled down 
over pale blue leggings. Kristina wore faded jeans and a green-and-gold 
Notre Dame sweatshirt. 

“Where’s Manny?” Lily asked, closing the front door behind Jared and 
me. 

“Haven’t seen him,” I replied, scraping my wet sneakers on the floor 
mat. “Isn’t he here?” 

“He wasn’t in school again today,” Kristina reported. 

“We’ve got to get serious,” Lily said, biting her lower lip. “Did you 
talk to Howie today? Did he tell you what his dad bought him?” 

“Anew synthesizer?” I replied, bending to open my guitar case. “Yeah. 
Howie told me all about it. He says it can sound like an entire orchestra.” 

“Who wants to sound like an orchestra?” Jared asked. He had a wet 
leaf stuck to his shoe. He pulled it off, but then didn’t know where to throw 
it away. So he jammed it in his jeans pocket. 

“If Howie sounds like an orchestra, and we sound like three guitars 
and a kiddie keyboard, we’re in major trouble,” Lily warned. 

“It’s not a kiddie keyboard!” Jared protested. 

I laughed. “Just because you wind a crank at the side of it doesn’t 
make it a kiddie keyboard!” 

“It’s small—but it has all the notes,” Jared insisted. He set the 
keyboard on the coffee table and bent down to plug it in. 

“Let’s stop messing around and get to work,” Kristina said, moving 
her fingers over the frets of her shiny red Gibson. “What song do you want 
to practice first?” 

“How can we practice without Manny?” I asked. “I mean, what’s the 



point?” 

“I tried calling him,” Lily said. “But his phone is messed up or 
something. It didn’t even ring.” 

“Let’s go to his house and get him,” I suggested. 

“Yeah. Good idea!” Kristina agreed. 

All four of us started for the front entryway to get our coats. But Lily 
stopped at the door. “Larry and I will go,” she announced to Kristina. “You 
and Jared should stay and practice. Why should we all go?” 

“Okay,” Jared agreed quickly. “Besides, someone should be here in 
case Manny shows up.” 

With that settled, Lily and I pulled on our coats and headed out the 
front door. Lily’s Doc Martens splashed through a wide puddle as we made 
our way along the sidewalk. 

“I hate it when the snow gets all gray and slushy,” she said. “Listen. 
All you can hear is dripping. Water dripping from the trees, dripping from 
the houses.” 

She stuck out her arm to block my path and stop me from walking. We 
listened in silence to the dripping sounds. 

“It’s deafening—isn’t it?” Lily asked, smiling. The sunlight reflected 
in her eyes. One blue eye, one green eye. 

“Deafening,” I repeated. Lily can be pretty weird sometimes. She once 
told me that she writes poetry. Long poems about nature. But she’s never 
shown any of them to me. 

We trudged through the slush. The sun felt warm on my face. I 
unzipped my parka. 

Manny’s house came into view as we turned the corner. Manny lives in 
a square-shaped brick house on top of a hill. It’s a great sledding hill. There 
were two little kids sledding down it now on blue plastic discs. They were 
going pretty slow since most of the snow had melted. 

We walked past them and made our way up to Manny’s front stoop. 
Lily rang the doorbell, and I knocked. “Hey, Manny—open up!” I shouted. 

No reply. 

No sounds at all. Just the drip drip drip of water from the gutter. 

“Hey, Manny!” I called. We rang and knocked again. 

“No one home,” Lily said quietly. She stepped off the stoop and 
moved to the front window. Edging up on tiptoes, she tried to peer in. 



“See anything?” I called. 

She shook her head. “No. The sun is reflecting on the glass. It looks 
dark inside.” 

“There’s no car in the driveway,” I said. I knocked one more time, as 
hard as I could. To my surprise, the front door swung in a little. 

“Hey—the door is open!” I called to Lily. She hurried back to the 
stoop. I pushed the door open a little further. “Anyone home?” I called in. 

No reply. 

“Hey—your door is open!” I shouted. 

Lily pushed the door all the way, and we stepped inside. “Manny?” she 
called, cupping her hands around her mouth. “Manny?” 

I stepped into the living room—and gasped. 

I tried to speak. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t believe what I saw. 



16 


Lily grabbed my arm as we both stared around the living room. 

The room was totally bare. No furniture. No curtains. No paintings or 
posters on the wall. Even the carpet had been removed, leaving shiny dark 
floorboards. 

“Wh-where did they go?” I managed to choke out. 

Lily made her way through the back hall to the kitchen. Also empty. 
Everything gone. An empty hole where the refrigerator had stood. 

“They moved!” Lily exclaimed. “I don’t believe it!” 

“But why didn’t Manny tell us?” I demanded, my eyes moving around 
the deserted room. “Why didn’t he tell us his family was moving away?” 

Lily shook her head and didn’t reply. The house was silent. I could 
hear water dripping from the gutter outside. 

“Maybe they had to move suddenly,” Lily said finally. 

“Suddenly? Why?” I demanded. 

It was a question that neither of us could answer. 

I love to run. 

Not when I’m running from snarling dogs. But I do love to run. 

I like the way it gets my heart pounding. And I like the thud of my 
sneakers on the ground, and the feeling of my muscles all working together. 

On Saturday mornings I like to go jogging with my dad. He always 
jogs at Miller Woods, along a path that curves around a small lake. 

It’s really pretty there. The air is always fresh-smelling. And it’s a very 
quiet place. 

Dad is tall and lean and pretty athletic. He used to be blond like me, 
but now his hair is mostly gray, and he has a big bald spot on top. 

He jogs every morning before work. I think he usually jogs pretty fast. 
But on Saturdays, he slows down so that we can run side by side. 

We usually jog without talking. That way we can concentrate on the 
scenery and the fresh air. 

But this Saturday morning, I felt like talking. I had decided to tell Dad 
everything. About the bottle of INSTA-TAN. And about the black hair that 



kept sprouting. 

As I talked, I kept my eyes straight ahead. I saw two big crows float 
down from the clear blue sky and perch side by side on the bare limb of a 
tree. The crows cawed loudly, as if talking to us. 

The lake sparkled brightly as Dad and I followed the curving path 
around it. Small patches of ice bobbed in the blue-green water. 

I started at the beginning and told the whole story. Dad slowed down a 
little more to listen. But we kept jogging as I talked. 

I told him about finding the bottle of tanning lotion and how we all 
splashed it on ourselves as a joke. Dad nodded but kept his eyes straight 
ahead. “I guess it didn’t work,” he said, sounding a little breathless from 
running. “You don’t look too tan, Larry.” 

“No, it didn’t work,” I continued. “The bottle was really old, Dad. It 
had expired a long time ago.” 

I took a deep breath. The next part was the hardest to tell. “It didn’t 
give me a tan, Dad. But something really weird started happening to me.” 

He kept jogging. We both leaped over a fallen tree branch. I slipped 
over a pile of wet leaves, but quickly caught my balance. 

“This weird hair started growing on me,” I told him in a shaky voice. 
“First on the back of my hand. Then on both hands. Then on my knees.” 

Dad stopped. He turned to me with a worried expression on his face. 
“Hair?” 

I nodded, breathing hard. “Black hair. Thick clumps of it. Very rough 
and spikey.” 

Dad swallowed hard. His eyes grew wide. With surprise? With fear? 
With disbelief? 

I couldn’t tell. 

But to my surprise, he grabbed my arm and started to pull me. “Come 
on, Larry. We’ve got to go.” 

“But, Dad—” I started, holding back. 

He tightened his grip and pulled harder. “I said we’ve got to go!” he 
insisted through gritted teeth. “Now!” 

He tugged so hard, he nearly pulled me off my feet! 

“Dad—what’s wrong?” I demanded in a high, shrill voice. “What is 

it?” 

He didn’t answer. He pulled me back along the path toward the street. 



His eyes were wild. His whole face was twisted into a tight, frightened 
scowl. 

“Dad—what’s wrong?” I cried. “Where are you taking me? Where?” 



17 


Dr. Murkin raised the hypodermic needle and examined it in the light. 
“Turn away, Larry,” he said softly. “I know you don’t like to watch. This 
won’t hurt at all.” 

Pain shot through my arm as the needle sank in. I shut my eyes and 
held my breath until he pulled out the needle. 

“I know it’s early,” he said, rubbing my arm with a cotton ball dipped 
in alcohol. “But since you were here, I thought I’d give you your shot.” 

My dad sat tensely in a folding chair against the wall of the small 
examining room. He had his arms crossed tightly over the front of his 
sweatshirt. 

“Wh-what about the hair?” I stammered to Dr. Murkin. “Did the 
INSTA-TAN—” 

The doctor shook his head. “I really don’t think tanning lotion can 
cause hair to grow, Larry. Those lotions work on the pigments of the skin. 
They—” 

“But it was a very old bottle!” I insisted. “Maybe the ingredients 
turned sour or something!” 

He waved his hand, as if to say, “No way.” 

Then he turned and started scribbling notes in my file. “I’m sorry, 
Larry,” he said, writing rapidly in a tiny handwriting. “It wasn’t the tanning 
lotion. Trust me.” 

He turned his head to me, his eyes studying me. “I’ve examined you 
from head to foot. You passed every test. You seem fine to me.” 

“Whew! That’s a relief!” Dad said, sighing. 

“But the hair—!” I insisted. 

“Let’s wait and see,” Dr. Murkin replied, his eyes on my dad. 

“Wait and see?” I cried. “You’re not going to give me any medicine or 
anything to stop it?” 

“Maybe it won’t happen again,” Dr. Murkin said. He closed my file. 
Then he motioned for me to jump down from the examining table. 

“Try not to worry, Larry,” he said, handing my coat to me. “You’ll be 
okay.” 



“Thank you, Dr. Murkin,” Dad said, climbing to his feet. He flashed 
the doctor a smile, but I could see that it was forced. Dad still looked really 
tense. 

I followed Dad out to the parking lot. We didn’t say anything until we 
were in the car and on the way home. “Feel better?” Dad asked, his eyes 
narrowed straight ahead on the road. 

“No,” I replied glumly. 

“What’s wrong?” Dad asked impatiently. “Dr. Murkin said you 
checked out fine.” 

“What about the ugly black hair?” I demanded angrily. “What about it? 
Why didn’t he do anything about it? Do you think he didn’t believe me?” 

“I’m sure he believed you,” Dad said softly. 

“Then why didn’t he do anything to help me?” I wailed. 

Dad didn’t reply for the longest time. He stared straight through the 
windshield, chewing his lower lip. Then, finally, he said in a hushed voice, 
“Sometimes the best thing is to wait.” 

We met at Lily’s house for band practice that afternoon. We sounded pretty 
good—but it wasn’t the same without Manny. 

We were all really upset that he had moved away without saying good¬ 
bye. Lily asked her mom to call some friends who were friendly with 
Manny’s parents. She wanted to find out where Manny and his family had 
moved. 

But the friends turned out to be as surprised as we were. 

We couldn’t find anyone who knew that Manny’s family planned to 
move from our town. 

I have to admit that our songs sounded better with two guitars instead 
of three. Lily has a very light singing voice—not much power. And three 
guitars nearly always drowned her out. 

With Manny gone, we could actually hear Lily some of the time. 

I kept messing up the Beatles song we were rehearsing—“I Want to 
Hold Your Hand.” I played the wrong chords and couldn’t get the rhythm 
right. 

I knew what the trouble was. I couldn’t stop thinking about Dr. Murkin 
and how he didn’t believe me about the hair. He said it wasn’t the INSTA- 
TAN. But maybe he was wrong. 



I felt so angry—and so... alone. 

Glancing around Lily’s living room as we started “I Want to Hold Your 
Hand” for the twentieth time, I studied my friends. Were they having the 
same problem? Were they growing ugly, black hair, too, and afraid to tell 
anyone? 

The first time I had asked, Lily had laughed at me and called me Hairy 
Larry. But I had to ask again. I couldn’t think about anything else. I had to 
know the truth. 

I waited till practice was over. Kristina was tucking her guitar into its 
case. Jared went into the kitchen to get a Coke from the fridge. Lily was 
standing beside the couch, one hand twirling the gold pirate coin at her 
throat. 

“I—I have to ask you something,” I said nervously when Jared 
returned to the room. 

He popped the top on the can, and a spray of Coke hit him in the face. 

Everyone laughed. 

“Can’t you work a Coke can?” Lily joked. “Do you need an instruction 
book?” 

“Ha-ha,” Jared replied sarcastically, wiping his face with his sleeve. 
“You deliberately shook the cans, Lily, so people would get squirted. Admit 
it.” 

Kristina laughed as she snapped her guitar case shut. “Maybe you 
should stick to juice boxes, Jared.” 

He stuck out his tongue at her. 

I cleared my throat loudly. “I want to ask you guys something,” I 
repeated in a shaky voice. 

They were all in a great mood, laughing and kidding around. They all 
seemed totally normal. 

Why was I the only one who felt worried and afraid? 

“Remember the INSTA-TAN stuff?” I started. “Have any of you been 
growing hair since we put that stuff on?” I could feel my face turning red. 
“I mean, really ugly patches of black hair?” 

Jared started to laugh, and Coke spurted out of his nose. He started to 
choke. Kristina hurried over to slap him on the back. 

“Hairy Larry!” Jared cried when he stopped choking. He pointed the 
Coke can at me and started chanting. “Hairy Larry! Hairy Larry!” 



“Come on, guys!” I pleaded. “I’m serious!” 

That made Kristina and Jared laugh even harder. 

I turned to Lily, who was still standing beside the couch. She had a 
troubled expression on her face. She definitely wasn’t laughing. She 
lowered her eyes to the floor as I continued to stare at her. 

“Larry is a werewolf!” Jared declared. 

“I hope The Geeks don’t have to play when there’s a full moon!” 
Kristina exclaimed. 

“Maybe Larry’s howling is better than his guitar playing!” Jared said. 
They both laughed. 

“I—I was just making a joke!” I stammered. I wanted a hole to open 
up in the floor so that I could disappear into it. 

I’m the only one, I realized. I’m the only one who is growing the ugly 

hair. 

That’s why Jared and Kristina thought it was so funny. It wasn’t 
happening to them. They didn’t have to worry about it. 

But Lily wasn’t joining in with the jokes. She turned away and started 
picking up music sheets from the floor and straightening the room. 

Lily always enjoys teasing me and making me blush. I stared at her, 
wondering if she had the same secret I did. 

I packed up my guitar slowly and waited for Jared and Kristina to 
leave. Then I put on my coat and baseball cap and followed Lily to the front 
door. 

On the front stoop, I turned back to her. “Lily, tell me the truth,” I 
insisted, studying her face. “Have you been growing weird patches of black 
hair on your hands and knees?” 

She hesitated, chewing her bottom lip. “I... I don’t want to talk about 
it,” she replied in a whisper. 

Then she slammed the front door. 

I didn’t move from the concrete stoop. I kept picturing her troubled 
expression. I kept hearing her whispered voice. 

Was it happening to Lily? If it was, why wouldn’t she admit it to me? 
Was she too embarrassed? 

Or was she embarrassed for me? 

Maybe it wasn’t happening to her, I realized. Maybe she just thinks 
I’m crazy. Maybe she feels bad for me because I keep acting like such a 



jerk. 

Feeling totally confused, I turned and headed for the street. The sun 
was still high in the sky, but the air felt cold. A sharp wind blew at my face 
as I started toward home. 

Leaning into the wind, I reached up and tugged down my cap to keep 
it from blowing away. To my surprise, I couldn’t pull it down. 

The cap suddenly felt tight. Too tight. 

I removed it and held it close to my face to study it. Had someone 
adjusted the back to make it tighter? 

No. 

A chill of dread ran down my back as I raised a hand to my forehead. 
And discovered why my cap didn’t fit. 

My entire forehead was covered with thick, bristly hair. 



18 


I burst through the back door, into the kitchen. “Mom—look at this!” I 
cried. “Look at my head!” 

My eyes darted around the room. “Mom?” 

Not there. 

I ran through the house, calling for her. I decided it was time to show 
my parents what was happening to me. Time to make them believe me. 

The stripe of hair would totally gross them out, would finally convince 
them this was serious. 

“Mom! Dad? Anybody home?” 

No. 

When I returned to the kitchen, I found a note on the refrigerator: WE 
WENT SHOPPING IN BROOKESDALE VILLAGE. HOME LATE. FIX 
YOURSELF A SNACK. 

With a cry of disgust, I tossed my cap across the room. Then I pulled 
off my parka and let it fall to the floor. 

My heart pounding, I made my way to the mirror in the front hall and 
studied myself. I looked like some kind of comic book mutant! 

My pale face stared back at me. It appeared exactly the same. Except 
that I had a thick, black stripe of fur across my forehead. 

Looks like I’m wearing a bandanna, I thought miserably. Like one of 
those headbands that skiers wear. Except this one is made of disgusting hair. 

I ran a trembling hand over the thick hair. 

My chest heaved up and down. I felt like crying and screaming 
furiously at the same time. I felt like grabbing the stripe of fur and ripping it 
out of my head. 

I couldn’t bear to look at myself. The hair was so gross, so disgusting. 

I decided there was no way I could wait for Mom and Dad to get 
home. I couldn’t leave that horrible hair on my face. Spinning away from 
the mirror, I ran upstairs to shave it off. 

I lathered up the strip of hair with shaving cream. Then I began to 
scrape my dad’s razor over it. 

“Ow!” It hurt, but I didn’t care. I had to cut it off. Every thick, bristly 



strand of it. 

Watching the hair fall into the sink, I suddenly knew what I had to do. 
I had to find the INSTA-TAN bottle. I had to find it and take it to Dr. 
Murkin. 

“If I bring him the bottle, I can make him believe me!” I told myself. 
Then Dr. Murkin can do tests on it. He can figure out why it’s making hair 
grow on me. 

And once he knows that it’s the INSTA-TAN that’s growing hair, Dr. 
Murkin will give me a cure, I decided. 

But where did we toss the bottle? 

I shut my eyes and struggled to remember. 

After I discovered the bottle, we had all run into Lily’s house to splash 
the stuff on. Then we had gone back outside to mess around in the snow. 

Did we toss the INSTA-TAN bottle back in the trash Dumpster next 
door? 

I had to find out. 

I scribbled a note to my parents, telling them I left something at Lily’s 
and would be back soon. Then I grabbed my coat and hurried out the door. 

The air had become a lot colder. Clouds had rolled over the sun, 
making the evening sky gray. I zipped up my parka and pulled the hood 
over my head. My forehead still tingled from where I had shaved it. 

The three blocks to Lily’s house seemed like three miles! As I turned 
the corner, her house came into view. 

I don’t want her to see me, I realized. If she sees me poking around 
that trash Dumpster, she’ll want to know why. And I’m not ready to tell her 
the whole story. 

She wouldn’t tell me the truth, I thought bitterly. Instead, she slammed 
the door on me. 

So I’m not ready to tell her the truth, either. 

I felt glad that it had become so dark out. Maybe Lily wouldn’t see me. 

I kept my eyes on her house as I approached. The lights were on in the 
dining room. Maybe her family was having an early dinner. 

Good, I thought. I’ll dig into the trash Dumpster, pull out the bottle, 
and disappear before they finish, before anyone has a chance to glance out 
the window. 

I stopped short when I saw that there was just one little problem. 



The trash Dumpster was gone. 

The workers must have hauled it away. 

I let out a long sigh and nearly slumped to my knees. “Now what?” I 
murmured out loud. 

Now how do I prove to Dr. Murkin that the INSTA-TAN is making me 
grow hair? 

The cold wind swirled around me as I stared at the curb where the 
Dumpster had stood. Fat brown leaves, blown by the twisting wind, 
fluttered around my legs. 

I shivered. 

Turning to leave, a memory flashed through my mind. 

The INSTA-TAN bottle. We hadn’t dropped it back into the Dumpster. 
We had tossed it into the woods on the other side of the neighbors’ house. 

“Yes!” I cried happily. “Yes!” 

We had chased each other across the neighbors’ yard—and I’d heaved 
the bottle into the trees. 

It will still be there, I told myself. It has to be there. 

I darted past Lily’s house, glancing up at the front windows. I couldn’t 
see anyone looking out. 

Past the neighbors’ house, dark and empty. The remodeling work not 
finished. 

Into the woods. The dead leaves wet and slippery under my shoes. The 
bare tree branches shook and rattled in the shifting, sharp wind. 

Where had the bottle landed? I asked myself. Where? 

It hadn’t gone far, I remembered. Just past the first trees. 

It had to be nearby, I knew. Somewhere near where I stood. 

A blanket of deep shadow had fallen over the woods. I kicked at a pile 
of dead leaves. My shoe hit something hard. 

Bending quickly, I tossed leaves away with both hands. 

Only a tree branch. 

I moved deeper into the woods, pushing my way through clumps of 
tall, dead weeds. 

I stopped. 

It has to be around here, I knew. My eyes desperately searched the 
shadows. 

There it is. No. Just a smooth stone. 



I kicked it away. Then I turned slowly, making a complete circle, my 
eyes sweeping the dark ground. 

Where is the bottle? Where? 

I sucked in my breath when I heard the sound. 

The crack of a twig. 

I listened hard. I heard the crackle of leaves. The brush of a leg against 
a winter-dry shrub. 

Another twig cracking. 

Swallowing hard, I realized I was no longer alone. 

“Wh-who’s there?” I called. 



19 


“Who’s there?” 

No reply. 

Frozen as still as a statue, I listened. I heard the scrape of feet moving 
rapidly over the ground. I heard heavy breathing. 

“Hey—who is it?” I called. 

I glanced down—and saw the bottle. Lying on its side, nestled in a pile 
of leaves right in front of me. 

I bent quickly, reached eagerly for the bottle with both hands. But I 
jerked back up to my feet in fright as a dark figure lumbered out from the 
trees. 

Panting hard. Its long tongue flapping from its open mouth. 

A tall, brown dog. Even in the dim light, I could see how scraggly and 
tangled its fur was. I could see large burrs stuck in its heaving side. 

I took a step back. “Are you alone, boy?” I called in a frightened 
whisper. “Huh? Are you alone, doggie?” 

The animal lowered its head and let out a whimper. 

I searched the woods for other dogs. Was he part of a pack? Part of the 
pack of stray dogs that liked to chase me, growling and snapping? 

I didn’t see any others. 

“Good dog,” I told him, keeping my voice low and calm. “Good 
doggie.” 

He stared up at me, still panting. His scraggly, brown tail wagged 
once, then drooped. 

I bent slowly, keeping my eyes on the dog, and picked up the bottle. It 
felt surprisingly cold. I held it up and tried to see if any of the liquid 
remained inside. 

But it was too dark to see. 

I’m pretty sure I didn’t use every last drop, I thought, struggling to 
remember. There has to be a little left. Enough for Dr. Murkin to test. 

I shook the bottle close to my ear, listening for the splash of liquid 
inside. Please, please, let there be a drop left! I pleaded silently. 

The trees shivered in a sharp, swirling gust. Leaves rustled and scraped 



against each other. 

The dog let out another soft whimper. 

I grasped the bottle tightly in my right hand and started to back away. 
“Bye-bye, doggie.” 

He tilted his head and stared up at me. 

I took another step back. “Bye, doggie,” I repeated softly. “Go home. 
Go home, boy.” 

He didn’t move. He let out another whimper. Then his tail began to 

wag. 

I took another step back, grasping the INSTA-TAN bottle tightly. 
Then, as I started to turn away from the staring dog, I saw the others. 

They poked out quickly, silently, from the dark trees. Five or six big 
dogs, their eyes glowing angrily. Then five or six more. 

As they lumbered nearer, moving quickly, steadily, I could hear their 
growls, low and menacing. They pulled back their lips and bared their teeth. 

I froze, staring in terror at their darkly glowing eyes, listening to their 
menacing, low growls. 

Then I spun around awkwardly. Started to run. 

“Ohh!” I let out a shrill cry as I stumbled over a fallen tree branch. 

The bottle flew out of my hand. 

As I fell, I reached out for it, grasping desperately. 

Missed. 

I watched in horror as it hit a sharp rock—and shattered. The jagged 
pieces flew in all directions. A tiny puddle of brown liquid washed over the 
rock. 

I landed hard on my knees and elbows. Pain shot through my body. 
But I ignored it and scrambled to my feet. 

I whirled around to face the dogs. 

But to my surprise, they were running in a different direction. Through 
the trees, I glimpsed a frightened rabbit, scrabbling over the leafy ground. 
Barking and growling, the dogs chased after it. 

My heart pounding, my knees still throbbing, I walked over to the rock 
and stared down at the jagged pieces of orange glass. I picked one up and 
examined it closely. 

“Now what do I do?” I asked myself out loud. I could still hear the 
excited barking of the dogs in the distance. “Now what?” 



The bottle was shattered into a dozen pieces. My evidence was gone. I 
had nothing to show Dr. Murkin. Nothing at all. 

With an angry cry, I tossed the piece of glass at the trees. Then I 
wearily slunk toward home. 

Mom and Dad hurried to a school meeting after dinner. I went upstairs to 
my room to do my homework. 

I didn’t feel like being alone. 

I took Jasper in my lap and petted her for a while. But she wasn’t in 
the mood. She glared at me with those weird yellow eyes. When that didn’t 
work, she scratched my hand, jumped away, and disappeared out of the 
room. 

I tried calling Lily, but no one answered at her place. 

Outside, the wind howled around the corner of the house. It made my 
bedroom windows rattle. 

A chill ran down my back. 

I leaned my elbows on my desk and hunched over my government 
textbook. But I couldn’t concentrate. The words on the page became a gray 
blur. 

I walked across the room and picked up my guitar. Then I bent down 
and plugged it into my amp. 

Lots of times when I’m feeling nervous or upset, I play my guitar for a 
while. It always calms me down. 

I cranked the amp up really high and started to play a loud blues 
melody. There was no one else home, no one to tell me to turn it down. I 
wanted to play as loud as I could—loud enough to drown out my troubled 
thoughts. 

But I had played for only three or four minutes when I realized that 
something was wrong. 

I kept missing notes. Messing up the chords. 

What’s wrong with me? I wondered. I’ve played this tune a million 
times. I can play it in my sleep. 

When I glanced down at my fingers, I saw the problem. 

“Ohh!” I uttered a weak groan. That disgusting hair had sprouted over 
both of my hands. My fingers were covered in thick, black hair. 

I turned my hands over. Both palms were covered, too. 



The guitar fell heavily to the floor as I jumped to my feet. 

My arms began to itch. 

With trembling hands, I tore at the cuffs. Pulled up the sleeves. 

My arms were covered, too! The thick, bristly hair swept over both 
arms and hands. 

I stood there, swallowing hard, staring down at my hairy arms and 
hands. My legs were trembling. I felt weak. 

My mouth suddenly felt dry. My throat ached. 

I tried to swallow. 

Was the disgusting hair growing on my tongue ? 

Feeling a jolt of nausea, I lurched across the hall to the bathroom. 
Clicking on the ceiling light, I leaned over the sink. I brought my face up 
close to the mirror and stuck out my tongue. 

No. 

My tongue was okay. 

But my face—my cheeks and chin—were covered with black hair. 

It’s spreading so fast! I realized. The mirror reflected my horror. 

It’s spreading so fast now—all over me. 

What am I going to do? 

Isn’t there anything I can do? 



20 


I got to school early on Monday morning and waited for Lily at her locker. 

It had taken hours to shave off all the bristly clumps of hair. But I did 
it. 

This morning I wore a sweater with extra-long sleeves, and I pulled a 
baseball cap down low on my head in case the hair grew back during the 
day. 

“Lily, where are you?” I murmured impatiently. I paced nervously 
back and forth in front of the row of green lockers. 

Lily and I have to face this problem together, I told myself. I 
remembered the frightened expression on Lily’s face when I asked her if 
she had been growing weird hair. 

I knew the same thing was happening to Lily. I just knew it. 

And I knew that Lily must be embarrassed like me, too embarrassed to 
admit it, to talk about it. 

But the two of us can figure out what to do, I decided. 

If the two of us go to Dr. Murkin and tell him about the INSTA-TAN 
lotion and the hair, he’ll have to believe us. 

But where was Lily? 

Kids jammed the hall, slamming lockers, laughing and talking. I 
glanced at my watch. Only three minutes till the bell rang. 

“How’s it going, Larry?” a voice called. 

I turned and saw Howie Hurwin grinning at me. His sister, Marissa, 
stood beside him. Her braid was caught in her backpack strap, and she was 
struggling to free it. 

“Hi, Howie,” I said, sighing. He was the last person I wanted to see 
this morning! 

“Ready for tomorrow?” he asked. Why did he have to grin like that 
when he talked? That grin just made me want to punch him. 

“Tomorrow?” I glanced down the crowded hall, searching for Lily. 

Howie laughed. “Did you forget about the Battle of the Bands?” 

“Ow!” Marissa cried. She finally managed to tug her braid free. “Is 
your band still going to play?” she asked. “We heard about Manny leaving.” 



“Yeah. We’ll be there,” I told her. “We sound pretty good.” 

“We do, too!” Howie replied, grinning even wider. “We might be on 
TV. My uncle knows a woman who works on Star Search. He thinks maybe 
he can get us on.” 

“Great,” I replied, without any enthusiasm. 

Where was Lily? 

“If we get on that show, we’ll probably win,” Marissa added, still 
fiddling with her long braid. “And then we’ll be famous.” 

“They asked us to play at the next school dance,” Howie said. “They 
didn’t ask your band, did they?” 

“No,” I replied. “No one asked us.” 

That made Howie’s grin practically burst off his face. “Too bad,” he 

said. 

The bell rang. “I’ve got to go,” I said, hurrying toward Miss 
Shindling’s room. 

“See you at the contest tomorrow,” Marissa called. 

“We’re going first,” Howie shouted. “I guess they’re saving the best 
for first]” 

I heard the two of them laughing as I stepped into the classroom. I 
made my way to my seat, searching for Lily. Had she slipped past me while 
I was talking with Howie and Marissa? 

No. No sign of her. 

I sank into my seat, feeling worried and disappointed. Was Lily sick 
today? I hoped not. She can’t get sick the day before the Battle of the 
Bands, I told myself. She just can’t. 

“Larry, would you hand out the tests?” Miss Shindling asked, dropping 
a heavy stack of papers into my arms. 

“Huh? Test?” 

I had totally forgotten. 

Lily didn’t come to school. I tried phoning her at lunchtime. The phone 
rang and rang, but no one answered. 

After school, I decided to go to Lily’s house to see what had happened 
to her. But as I walked out of the school building, I remembered that my 
mom had asked me to come straight home after school. She had some 
chores she wanted me to help her with. 



It was a clear, cold day. Puffy, white clouds floated high in the 
afternoon sky. All the snow had finally melted, but the ground was still soft 
and wet. 

I waited for several cars to pass. Then I crossed the street and headed 
for home. 

I had walked nearly a block when I realized I was being followed. 

A dog brushed softly against my leg. Startled, I stopped and stared 
down at it. 

The dog had light brown fur, almost red, with a white patch at its 
throat. It was a medium-sized dog, a little bigger than a cocker spaniel. It 
had long, floppy brown ears and a long, furry tail that swept slowly back 
and forth as it gazed up at me. 

“Who are you?” I asked it. “I’ve never seen you before.” 

I glanced around, making sure there weren’t a dozen other dogs 
lurking in the bushes, getting ready to chase after me. 

Then I turned and started walking again. 

The dog brushed my leg again and kept on going. As I walked, it 
stayed a few yards ahead of me, glancing back to make sure I was 
following. 

“Are you following me —or am I following you?” I called to it. 

The dog’s tail gave a single wag in reply. 

It followed me all the way home. 

My mom was waiting for me in the driveway. She had a long green 
sweater pulled down over her jeans. “Nice day,” she commented, glancing 
up at the sunny sky. 

“Hi, Mom,” I greeted her. “This dog followed me home.” 

The dog sniffed at the low evergreen shrubs that lined the front walk. 

“She’s kind of pretty,” Mom said. “What a nice color. Who does she 
belong to?” 

I shrugged. “Beats me. I’ve never seen her before.” 

The dog came over and stared up at Mom. 

“At least she’s friendly,” I said, setting my heavy backpack down on 
the driveway. “Maybe we should keep her.” 

“No way,” Mom replied sharply. “No dogs. Not with Jasper in the 
house.” 

I bent down and petted the top of the dog’s head. 



“She has a tag on her collar,” Mom said, pointing. “Check it out, Larry. 
Maybe it says the owner’s name.” 

The dog’s tail wagged furiously as I petted her head. “Good dog,” I 
said softly. 

“Come on, Larry. See what the tag says,” Mom insisted. 

“Okay, okay.” I reached for the round, gold tag hanging down from the 
dog’s collar. Then I dropped to my knees and lowered my face so that I 
could see it clearly. 

“Huh?” 

I recognized it instantly. 

It wasn’t a dog tag. It was Lily’s gold pirate coin. 



21 


I nearly fell over. I felt as if someone had kicked me in the stomach. 

“M-mom!” I stammered. But my voice came out as a gasp. 

“Larry—what are you doing?” Mom called. She had wandered to the 
side of the driveway and was pulling up some dead weeds. “What does the 
tag say?” 

“It—it isn’t a tag,” I finally managed to choke out. 

She turned her head back to me. “Huh?” 

“It isn’t a dog tag,” I repeated, still holding it between my fingers. “It’s 
Lily’s gold pirate coin.” 

Mom laughed. “Why would Lily give her coin to a dog? Didn’t her 
grandfather give her that coin?” 

“I—I don’t know why,” I stammered. “I don’t get it, Mom.” 

The dog’s hot breath brushed over my hand. She pulled away from me, 
settled back, and started scratching her long, floppy ear with her back paw. 

“Are you sure it’s a gold coin, Larry?” Mom asked, crossing the drive, 
standing right behind me. 

I nodded and reached for the coin again. “Yeah. It’s Lily’s gold coin, 
Mom.” 

“It must be some other gold coin,” Mom suggested. “I’m sure it isn’t 
the same coin.” 

Mom must be right, I decided. 

I let go of the coin and raised my hand to pet the dog’s head. 

But my hand stopped in midair when I saw the dog’s eyes. 

She had one blue eye and one green eye. 



22 


“It’s Lily! It’s Lily!” I shrieked, jumping to my feet. 

My shouts frightened the dog. She uttered a shrill yip, turned, and 
bolted from the front yard. 

“Lily—come back!” I called after her. “Come back! Lily!” 

“Larry—wait!” Mom cried. “Please—!” 

I didn’t hear the rest of what she said. Jumping over my backpack, I 
darted toward the street. I hurtled across without slowing to look for cars— 
and kept running toward Lily’s house. 

It is Lily! I told myself. That dog has a green eye and a blue eye. And 
it’s wearing Lily’s coin! 

It is Lily! I know it! 

I could hear my mom calling for me to come back. But I ignored her 
and kept running. 

Lily’s house was three blocks away. I ran at full speed the whole way. 
By the time her house came into view, I was gasping for breath, and I had a 
sharp pain in my side. 

But I didn’t care. 

I had to see Lily. I had to know for sure that the dog wasn’t Lily. 

Such a crazy thought! As I crossed the street, I started to realize how 
crazy it was. 

Lily, a dog? 

Larry, are you totally losing it? I asked myself. Mom must think I’m 
totally wacko! I realized. 

Lily, a dog? 

I slowed down, rubbing the pain at my side, trying to massage it away. 

I spotted Lily’s parents in the driveway. The trunk of their blue Chevy 
was open. Mr. Vonn was lifting a suitcase into it. 

“Hi!” I called breathlessly. “Hey—hi!” 

“Hello, Larry,” Mrs. Vonn said as I stepped up to the car. I saw two 
other suitcases and some smaller bags waiting to be loaded into the car. 

“Going on a trip?” I asked, struggling to catch my breath. The pain in 
my side kept throbbing, refusing to go away. 



They didn’t answer. Mr. Vonn groaned as he hoisted a heavy suitcase 
into the trunk. 

“Where’s Lily?” I asked. I handed him one of the smaller bags. “She 
wasn’t in school today.” 

“We’re going away,” Mrs. Vonn said quietly from behind me. 

“Well, where’s Lily?” I repeated. “Is she inside?” 

Mr. Vonn frowned, but didn’t reply. 

I turned to Lily’s mom. “Can I see her?” I asked impatiently. “Is Lily 
inside?” 

“You must have the wrong house,” she replied softly. 

My mouth dropped open. “Wrong house? Mrs. Vonn—what do you 
mean?” 

“There’s no one here named Lily,” she said. 



23 


For some reason, I burst out laughing. 

Startled laughter. Frightened laughter. 

Mrs. Vonn’s sad expression cut my laughter short—and sent a chill 
down my back. 

“Is Lily—?” I started to say. 

Mrs. Vonn grabbed my shoulder and squeezed it. She lowered her face 
close to mine. “Listen to what I’m telling you, Larry,” she said through 
gritted teeth. 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

“There is no Lily,” she repeated, squeezing my shoulder hard. “Just 
forget about her.” She had tears in her eyes. 

Mr. Vonn slammed the car trunk. I jumped out of Mrs. Vonn’s grasp, 
my heart pounding. 

“You’d better go,” Mr. Vonn said firmly, coming over to join his wife. 

I took a step back. My legs felt weak and shaky. 

“But, Lily—” I started. 

“You’d better go,” Mr. Vonn repeated. 

At the side of the garage, I spotted the red-brown dog. She whimpered 
sadly, her head hung low. 

I whirled around and ran, as fast as I could. 

Mom and Dad acted so strange at dinner. They refused to discuss Lily or 
the dog or Lily’s parents. 

Mom and Dad kept glancing at each other, giving each other 
meaningful looks that I wasn’t supposed to see. 

They think I’m crazy! I realized. That’s why they’re refusing to talk 
about it. They think I’m losing my mind. They don’t want to say anything 
to me until they decide how they’re going to handle me. 

“I’m not crazy!” I shouted suddenly, dropping my fork and knife onto 
the table. I hadn’t touched my spaghetti and meatballs. 

How could I eat? 

“I’m not crazy! I’m not making this up!” 



“Can’t we talk about it another time?” Mom pleaded, glancing at Dad. 

“Let’s just finish our dinner,” Dad added, keeping his eyes on his plate. 

After dinner, I called Jared and Kristina over to give them the bad 
news. I didn’t want them to think that I was crazy. So I simply told them 
that Lily had gone away. 

“But what about tomorrow?” Jared cried. 

“Yeah. What about the Battle of the Bands?” Kristina demanded. 
“How could Lily leave on the day before the contest?” 

I shrugged. We were sitting in the living room. Kristina and I sat on 
opposite ends of the couch. Jared was sprawled in the chair across from me. 

Jasper brushed over my feet. I leaned down and lifted her into my lap. 
Her yellow eyes stared up at me. Then she closed them and settled against 
me, purring softly. 

“Where did Lily go?” Kristina asked angrily, drumming her fingers on 
the couch arm. “On vacation? Why didn’t she tell us she was going to miss 
the contest?” 

“Howie Hurwin will jump for joy when he hears this news,” Jared 
muttered glumly, shaking his head. 

“I don’t know where Lily went,” I told them. “I saw her parents 
loading suitcases into the car. Now they’re gone. That’s all I know. I’m sure 
Lily is very unhappy. I know Lily wanted to be with us. I don’t think she 
had a choice.” 

I had a sudden urge to tell them everything that had happened. But I 
didn’t want them to start laughing at me. Or worrying about me. 

I felt so mixed up. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

I wanted Lily back. And Manny. That I knew. 

And I wanted the ugly hair to stop sprouting all over my body. 

If only I had never found that bottle of INSTA-TAN. 

This was all my fault. All of it. 

“So I guess The Geeks have to pull out of the band contest tomorrow,” 
I said glumly. 

“I guess,” Jared repeated, shaking his head. 

“No way!” Kristina cried, surprising both of us. She jumped to her feet 
and stood between Jared and me. She balled both hands into fists. “No 
way!” she repeated. 

“But we don’t have a singer—” Jared protested. 



“I can sing,” Kristina replied quickly. “I’m a pretty good singer.” 

“But you haven’t rehearsed any of the songs,” Jared said. “Do you 
know the words?” 

Kristina nodded. “All of them.” 

“But, Kristina—” I started. 

“Listen, guys,” she said sharply, “we have to go onstage tomorrow. 
Even if it’s just the three of us. We can’t let Howie Hurwin win tomorrow— 
can we?” 

“I’d like to wipe that grin off Howie’s face,” I muttered. 

“Me, too,” Jared agreed. “But how can we? Two guitars and a 
keyboard? Howie has his full band. He’ll blast us out of the auditorium.” 

“Not if we play our hearts out!” Kristina exclaimed with emotion. 
“Not if we give it our best.” 

“Let’s do it for Lily!” I blurted out. The words just tumbled from my 
mouth. As soon as I said it, I felt embarrassed. 

But Kristina and Jared picked right up on it. “Let’s do it for Lily!” they 
both cried. “We can win! We really can! Let’s win it for Lily!” 

So it was decided. The Geeks would go onstage tomorrow afternoon. 
Could we win? Could we beat Howie and the Shouters? 

Probably not. 

But we’d give it our best shot. 

“Let’s go up to my room and practice a little,” I suggested. 

Jared started toward the stairs. But Kristina didn’t move. 

I turned and found her staring at my face in horror. 

“Larry—!” she cried, pointing. “What’s that on your forehead?” 



24 


I gasped in horror. 

My hand shot up to my forehead. 

The ugly black hair—it had grown back, I knew. And now Kristina 
and Jared were both staring at it. They both saw it—saw that I was 
becoming some kind of hairy monster. 

I rubbed my forehead with a trembling hand. 

Smooth. 

My forehead was smooth! 

“It’s right there.” Kristina pointed. 

I hurried over to the hallway mirror and gazed up at my forehead. I 
discovered an orange smear near my right temple. 

“It’s spaghetti sauce,” I moaned. “I must have rubbed my face during 
dinner.” 

I rubbed off the orange spot. My entire body was shaking. Kristina had 
scared me to death! Over a dumb spot of spaghetti sauce! 

“Larry, are you okay?” she asked, standing behind me and staring at 
my reflection in the mirror. “You look kind of weird.” 

“I’m okay,” I replied quickly, trying to force my body to stop shaking 
and quaking. 

“Hey—don’t get sick,” Jared warned. “Kristina and I can’t go on the 
stage by ourselves tomorrow.” 

“I’ll be there,” I told them. “Don’t worry, guys. I’ll be there.” 

The next afternoon, the whole school jammed into the auditorium to watch 
the Battle of the Bands. 

Feeling really nervous, I stood backstage and peeked out through the 
curtain. The lights in the auditorium were all on, and Mr. Fosburg, the 
principal, stood in front of the curtain, both arms raised, trying to get 
everyone quiet. 

Behind me, Howie Hurwin and his band were tuning up, adjusting the 
amps, making sure the sound was right. Marissa was wearing a very short, 
sparkly red dress over black tights. She caught me staring at her and flashed 



me a smug smile. 

The Geeks should have dressed up, I realized, watching Marissa. We 
didn’t even think of it. The three of us were wearing T-shirts and jeans, our 
normal school clothes. 

I turned and gazed at Howie’s new synthesizer keyboard. It was about 
a mile long, and it had a thousand buttons and dials on it. It made Jared’s 
keyboard look like a baby toy. 

Howie caught me staring at it. “Cool, huh?” he called, grinning that 
gruesome grin of his. “Hey, Larry—after we win the contest, you can have 
my autograph!” 

Howie laughed. So did Marissa and the rest of the Shouters. 

I turned and slumped away to join Jared and Kristina at the side of the 
stage. “We’re total losers,” I moaned, shaking my head. 

“Good attitude, Larry,” Jared replied sarcastically. 

“Maybe Howie’s giant keyboard will blow out all the fuses,” I said 
glumly. “That’s our only chance.” 

Kristina rolled her eyes. “They can’t be that good,” she muttered. 

But they were. 

The auditorium lights darkened. The curtain slid open. Howie and the 
Shouters stepped into the red-and-blue stage lights. And began blasting out 
the old Chuck Berry rock-and-roll song “Johnny B. Goode.” 

They sounded great. And they looked great. 

Marissa’s dress sparkled in the light. They had worked out dance 
moves, and they all danced and moved as they played. 

We should have thought of that, I told myself glumly, watching from 
the side of the stage. When we play, the three of us just stand around—like 
geeks ! 

The kids in the auditorium went crazy. They all jumped to their feet 
and began clapping along, moving and dancing. 

They stayed on their feet for all four of the Shouters’ songs. Each song 
came louder and faster than the last. The old auditorium rocked and shook 
so hard, I thought the floor might cave in! 

Then, as Howie and Marissa and the others took their bows, the 
auditorium erupted in wild cheers and shouts of, “More! Moooore! 
Mooooore!” 

So Howie and the Shouters did two more songs. 



Jared, Kristina, and I kept casting tense glances at each other as they 
played. This wasn’t doing a whole lot for our confidence! 

Finally, Howie and Marissa took several more bows and ran off the 
stage, waving their fists high above their heads in triumph. 

“Your turn!” Howie called to me as he ran past. He grinned. “Hey, 
Larry—where’s the rest of your band?” 

I started to reply angrily. But Jared gave me a hard shove, and the three 
of us moved uncertainly onto the stage. 

I bent down and plugged my guitar into the amp. Jared worked quickly 
to adjust the sound level of his little keyboard. 

Howie’s giant keyboard had been pushed to the back of the stage. It 
seemed to stare at us, reminding us how good—and loud—the Shouters had 
sounded. 

Kristina stood tensely at the microphone, her arms crossed in front of 
her T-shirt. I played a few chords, testing the level of the amp. My hands 
felt cold and sweaty. They slipped over the strings. 

The audience was talking and laughing, restless, waiting for us to start. 

“Are we ready?” I whispered to Jared and Kristina. “Let’s do T Want 
to Hold Your Hand’ first. Then go into the Rolling Stones song.” 

They nodded. 

I took a deep breath and steadied my hands on my guitar. 

Jared leaned over the keyboard. Kristina uncrossed her arms and 
stepped to the microphone, jamming both hands into her jeans pockets. 

We started the Beatles song. 

Shaky at first. All three of us sang on this one. And the harmony was 
off. 

My guitar was too loud. It was drowning out our voices. I wanted to 
stop and turn it down. But of course I couldn’t. 

The audience sat quietly, listening. They didn’t jump to their feet and 
start dancing. 

They applauded loudly as we finished the song. But it was polite 
applause. No loud cheering. No real enthusiasm. 

At least we got through it! I told myself, wiping my sweaty hands on 
my jeans legs. 

I stepped forward as we started the Rolling Stones song. 

I had a really long guitar solo in this number. I was praying I didn’t 



mess up. 

I nodded to Jared and Kristina. Kristina grabbed the floor microphone 
with both hands, leaning close to it. Jared started the song on the keyboard. 

I started my solo. Badly. I messed up the first chords. 

My heart started to thump. My mouth was suddenly too dry to 
swallow. 

I closed my eyes and tried to shut out everything—to concentrate on 
my fingers, on the music. 

As I played, the audience started to cheer. A few shouts at first. Some 
scattered applause. 

But then the cheering grew louder and louder. 

Happily, I opened my eyes. Several kids were on their feet, shouting 
and laughing. 

I bent my knees and let my fingers move over the frets, the pick 
moving automatically now over the strings. 

I was starting to feel good—really good. 

The cheers grew louder. I realized that several kids were pointing at 
me. 

What’s going on? I wondered. 

And I suddenly knew that something was wrong. The cheers were too 
loud. The laughter was too loud. Too many kids were jumping up and 
pointing fingers at me. 

“Great special effects!” I heard a boy shout from the first row. 

“Yeah. Great special effects!” 

Huh? I thought. What special effects? 

It didn’t take me long to figure it out. 

As Kristina started to sing, I reached my hand up and rubbed it over 
my face. 

I cried out in horror as I felt the stiff, prickly hair. 

My face was covered in it. My chin, my cheeks, my forehead. 

The thick, black hair had sprouted over my entire face. 

And the whole school was staring at it, staring at me. 

The whole school knew my horrible, embarrassing secret. 



25 


“We won! We won!” I heard Jared and Kristina shouting gleefully behind 
me. 

But I set my guitar on the stage floor, turned away from them, and 
started to run. 

The kids in the auditorium were still shouting and cheering. 

We had won the contest because of my amazing hairy transformation. 
“Great special effects!” that kid had shouted. The “special effects” had won 
the day. 

But I wasn’t feeling like a winner. 

I felt like an ugly freak. 

The bushy hair had covered my face, then spread down to my neck and 
shoulders. Both hands were covered in bristly fur, and I could feel it 
growing up my arms. My back began to itch. Was it growing on my back, 
too? 

“Hey, Larry—Larry!” I heard Kristina and Jared calling. “The trophy! 
Come get your trophy!” 

But I was out the stage door, the wild cheers of the audience ringing in 
my ears. Out the back door of the school. Into a chilly, gray afternoon. Dark 
clouds low over the trees. 

Running now. Running blindly, my heart thudding. 

Running home. Covered in thick, black fur. 

Running in panic, in shame. In fear. 

The houses and trees passed in a gray blur. As I turned up my 
driveway, I saw Mom and Dad back by the garage. They both turned to me, 
surprise on their faces. 

“Look at me!” I shrieked. “Look!” My voice burst out, hoarse and 
terrified. “Now do you believe me?” 

They gaped at me, their mouths wide open in shock and horror. 

I held my hands up so they could see my arms. “Do you see my face?” 
I wailed. “See my arms? My hands?” 

They both gasped. Mom grabbed Dad’s arm. 

“Now do you believe me?” I cried. “Now do you believe that the 



INSTA-TAN lotion makes hair grow?” 

I stood staring at them, my chest heaving, panting loudly, tears in my 
eyes. I stood waiting, waiting for them to say something. 

Finally, Mom broke the silence. “Larry, it isn’t the tanning lotion,” she 
said softly, holding tightly onto Dad. “We tried to keep it from you. But we 
can’t any longer.” 

“Huh? Keep what from me?” I demanded. 

They exchanged glances. Mom let out a sob. Dad slipped his arm 
around her. 

“It isn’t the tanning lotion,” Dad said in a trembling voice. “Larry, you 
have to know the truth now. You’re growing all that hair because you’re not 
a human. You’re a dog.”

I bent down and lapped up some water from the plastic water bowl Mom 
and Dad put on the front stoop for me. It’s so hard to drink without 
splashing water all over my snout. 

Then I bounded down the steps on all fours and joined Lily over by the 
evergreen shrubs. We sniffed the shrubs for a while. Then we loped off to 
the next yard to see if there was anything interesting to sniff. 

It’s been two weeks since my human body vanished and I turned back 
into my real dog identity. Luckily, before I changed back, Mom and Dad— 
or, I should say, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd—were nice enough to explain to me 
what had happened. 

They work for Dr. Murkin, you see. In fact, everyone in town works 
for Dr. Murkin. The whole town is kind of an experimental testing lab. 

A few years ago, Dr. Murkin found a way to change dogs into children. 
He discovered a serum that made us dogs look and think and act like 
people. That’s what my shots were. He gave me fresh serum every two 
weeks. 

But after a while, the serum doesn’t work anymore. It wears off. And 
the children go back to being dogs. 

“Dr. Murkin has decided to stop testing the serum on dogs,” Mom told 
me. “It just doesn’t work. And it causes the families too much pain when 
the children turn back into dogs.” 

“He’s never going to work with dogs again,” Dad explained. “The 
serum just doesn’t last long enough with dogs. So, no more dogs.” 

It was nice of the Boyds to explain to me what had happened. I felt so 
grateful, I licked their hands. Then I ran off to find Lily and show her that I 
was a dog, too. 

Lily and I roam around together all the time. Sometimes Manny joins 
us. There are so many dogs roaming around in this town. I guess they all 
were human for a while. 

I’m glad Dr. Murkin isn’t using dogs for his tests anymore. Dogs 
should be dogs, in my humble opinion. 

Lily and I found some good dirt to sniff in the neighbors’ flower 



garden. There aren’t any flowers to dig up yet. But the dirt smells really 
great. 

Then I saw the Boyds’ car roll up the driveway. They’d been gone all 
afternoon. I went running up eagerly to the car, wagging my tail happily. 

I jumped up and barked out a greeting. 

To my surprise, Mrs. Boyd was carrying a baby. A tiny baby, tightly 
wrapped in pink blankets. 

She held the baby in both arms, and carried it carefully up the walk 
toward the house. Mr. Boyd had a big smile on his face as he caught up to 
her. 

“What a good little girl,” Mrs. Boyd cooed to the baby. “Yes, you are. 
You’re a good little girl. Welcome to your new home, Jasper.” 

Huh? I thought. Isn’t Jasper a funny name for a little girl? 

Then I stared up at the baby and saw her bright yellow eyes. 



A NIGHT IN  TERROR TOWER 
Goosebumps - 27 
R.L. Stine

“I’m scared,” Eddie said. 

I shivered and zipped my coat up to my chin. “Eddie, this was your idea,” I 
told my brother. “I didn’t beg and plead to see the Terror Tower. You did.” 

He raised his brown eyes to the tower. A strong gust of wind fluttered his 
dark brown hair. “I have a strange feeling about it, Sue. A bad feeling.” 

I made a disgusted face. “Eddie, you are such a wimp! You have a bad 
feeling about going to the movies!” 

“Only scary movies,” he mumbled. 

“You’re ten years old,” I said sharply. “It’s time to stop being scared of your 
own shadow. It’s just an old castle with a tower,” I said, gesturing toward it. 
“Hundreds of tourists come here every day.” 

“But they used to torture people here,” Eddie said, suddenly looking very 
pale. “They used to lock people in the Tower and let them starve to death.” 

“Hundreds of years ago,” I told him. “They don’t torture people here 
anymore, Eddie. Now they just sell postcards.” 

We both gazed up at the gloomy old castle built of gray stones, darkened 
over time. Its two narrow towers rose up like two stiff arms at its sides. 

Storm clouds hovered low over the dark towers. The bent old trees in the 
courtyard shivered in the wind. It didn’t feel like spring. The air was heavy and 
cold. I felt a raindrop on my forehead. Then another on my cheek. 

A perfect London day, I thought. A perfect day to visit the famous Terror 
Tower. 

This was our first day in England, and Eddie and I had been sight-seeing all 
over London. Our parents had to be at a conference at our hotel. So they signed 
us up with a tour group, and off we went. 

We toured the British Museum, walked through Harrods department store, 
visited Westminster Abbey and Trafalgar Square. 

For lunch, we had bangers and mash (sausages and mashed potatoes) at a 
real English pub. Then the tour group took a great bus ride, sitting on top of a 
bright red double-decker bus. 

London was just as I had imagined it. Big and crowded. Narrow streets 
lined with little shops and jammed with those old-fashioned-looking black taxis. 



The sidewalks were filled with people from all over the world. 

Of course my scaredy-cat brother was totally nervous about traveling 
around a strange city on our own. But I’m twelve and a lot less wimpy than he 
is. And I managed to keep him pretty calm. 

I was totally surprised when Eddie begged to visit the Terror Tower. 

Mr. Starkes, our bald, red-faced tour guide, gathered the group together on 
the sidewalk. There were about twelve of us, mostly old people. Eddie and I 
were the only kids. 

Mr. Starkes gave us a choice. Another museum—or the Tower. 

“The Tower! The Tower!” Eddie pleaded. “I’ve got to see the Terror 
Tower!” 

We took a long bus ride to the outskirts of the city. The shops gave way to 
rows of tiny redbrick houses. Then we passed even older houses, hidden behind 
stooped trees and low, ivy-covered walls. 

When the bus pulled to a stop, we climbed out and followed a narrow street 
made of bricks, worn smooth over the centuries. The street ended at a high wall. 
Behind the wall, the Terror Tower rose up darkly. 

“Hurry, Sue!” Eddie tugged my sleeve. “We’ll lose the group!” 

“They’ll wait for us,” I told my brother. “Stop worrying, Eddie. We won’t 
get lost.” 

We jogged over the old bricks and caught up with the others. Wrapping his 
long, black overcoat around him, Mr. Starkes led the way through the entrance. 

He stopped and pointed at a pile of gray stones in the large, grass-covered 
courtyard. “That wall was the original castle wall,” he explained. “It was built by 
the Romans in about the year 400. London was a Roman city then.” 

Only a small section of the wall still stood. The rest had crumbled or fallen. 
I couldn’t believe I was staring at a wall that was over fifteen hundred years old! 

We followed Mr. Starkes along the path that led to the castle and its towers. 
“This was built by the Romans to be a walled fort,” the tour guide told us. “After 
the Romans left, it became a prison. That started many years of cruelty and 
torture within these walls.” 

I pulled my little camera from my coat pocket and took a picture of the 
Roman wall. Then I turned and snapped a few pictures of the castle. The sky had 
darkened even more. I hoped the pictures would come out. 

“This was London’s first debtor prison,” Mr. Starkes explained as he led the 
way. “If you were too poor to pay your bills, you were sent to prison. Which 



meant that you could never pay your bills! So you stayed in prison forever.” 

We passed a small guardhouse. It was about the size of a phone booth, 
made of white stones, with a slanted roof. I thought it was empty. But to my 
surprise, a gray-uniformed guard stepped out of it, a rifle perched stiffly on his 
shoulder. 

I turned back and gazed at the dark wall that surrounded the castle grounds. 
“Look, Eddie,” I whispered. “You can’t see any of the city outside the wall. It’s 
as if we really stepped back in time.” 

He shivered. I don’t know if it was because of my words or because of the 
sharp wind that blew through the old courtyard. 

The castle cast a deep shadow over the path. Mr. Starkes led us up to a 
narrow entrance at the side. Then he stopped and turned back to the group. 

I was startled by the tense, sorrowful expression on his face. “I am so sorry 
to give you this bad news,” he said, his eyes moving slowly from one of us to the 
next. 

“Huh? Bad news?” Eddie whispered, moving closer to me. 

“You will all be imprisoned in the north tower,” Mr. Starkes announced 
sternly. “There you will be tortured until you tell us the real reason why you 
chose to come here.”

Eddie let out a startled cry. Other members of the tour group uttered shocked 
gasps. 

Mr. Starkes began to chuckle as a grin spread over his round, red face. “Just 
a little Terror Tower joke,” he said brightly. “Eve got to have some fun, you 
know.” 

We all laughed, too. Except Eddie. He still seemed shaken. “That guy is 
crazy!” Eddie whispered. 

Actually, Mr. Starkes was a very good tour guide. Very cheerful and 
helpful, and he seemed to know everything about London. My only problem was 
that sometimes I had trouble understanding his British accent. 

“As you can see, the castle consists of several buildings,” Mr. Starkes 
explained, turning serious. “That long, low building over there served as a 
barracks for the soldiers.” He pointed across the broad lawn. 

I snapped a picture of the old barracks. It looked like a long, low hut. Then 
I turned and snapped a picture of the gray-uniformed guard standing at attention 
in front of the small guardhouse. 

I heard several gasps of surprise behind me. Turning back, I saw a large 
hooded man creep out of the entrance and sneak up behind Mr. Starkes. He wore 
an ancient-looking green tunic and carried an enormous battle-axe. 

An executioner! 

He raised the battle-axe behind Mr. Starkes. 

“Does anyone here need a very fast haircut?” Mr. Starkes asked casually, 
without turning around. “This is the castle barber!” 

We all laughed. The man in the green executioner’s costume took a quick 
bow, then disappeared back into the building. 

“This is fun,” Eddie whispered. But I noticed he was clinging very close to 
me. 

“We are going to enter the torture chamber first,” Mr. Starkes announced. 
“Please stick together.” He raised a red pennant on a long stick. “I’ll carry this 
high so you can find me easily. It’s so easy to get lost inside. There are hundreds 
of chambers and secret passages.” 

“Wow. Cool!” I exclaimed. 



Eddie glanced at me doubtfully. 

“You’re not too scared to go into the torture chamber, are you?” I asked 

him. 

“Who? Me?” he replied shakily. 

“You will see some very unusual torture devices,” Mr. Starkes continued. 
“The wardens had many ways to inflict pain on their poor prisoners. We 
recommend that you do not try them at home.” 

A few people laughed. I couldn’t wait to get inside. 

“I ask you again to stick together,” Mr. Starkes urged as the group began to 
file through the narrow doorway into the castle. “My last tour group was lost 
forever in there. Most of them are still wandering the dark chambers. My boss 
really scolded me when I got back to the office!” 

I laughed at his lame joke. He had probably told it a thousand times. 

At the entrance, I raised my eyes to the top of the dark tower. It was solid 
stone. No windows except for a tiny square one near the very top. 

People were actually imprisoned here, I thought. Real people. Hundreds of 
years ago. I suddenly wondered if the castle was haunted. 

I tried to read the serious expression on my brother’s face. I wondered if 
Eddie was having the same chilling thoughts. 

We stepped up to the dark entranceway. “Turn around, Eddie,” I said. I took 
a step back and pulled my camera from my coat pocket. 

“Let’s go in,” Eddie pleaded. “The others are getting ahead of us.” 

“I just want to take your picture at the castle entrance,” I said. 

I raised the camera to my eye. Eddie made a dumb face. I pressed the 
shutter release and snapped the picture. 

I had no way of knowing that it was the last picture I would ever take of 
Eddie.

Mr. Starkes led the way down a narrow stairway. Our sneakers squeaked on the 
stone floor as we stepped into a large, dimly lit chamber. 

I took a deep breath and waited for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. The 
air smelled old and dusty. 

It was surprisingly warm inside. I unzipped my coat and pulled my long 
brown hair out from under the collar. 

I could see several display cases against the wall. Mr. Starkes led the way to 
a large wooden structure in the center of the room. The group huddled closely 
around him. 

“This is the Rack,” he proclaimed, waving his red pennant at it. 

“Wow. It’s real!” I whispered to Eddie. I’d seen big torture devices like this 
in movies and comic books. But I never thought they really existed. 

“The prisoner was forced to lie down here,” Mr. Starkes continued. “His 
arms and legs were strapped down. When that big wheel was turned, the ropes 
pulled his arms and legs, stretching them tight.” He pointed to the big wooden 
wheel. 

“Turn the wheel more, and the ropes pulled tighter,” Mr. Starkes said, his 
eyes twinkling merrily. “Sometimes the wheel was turned and the prisoner was 
stretched and stretched—until his bones were pulled right out of their sockets.” 

He chuckled. “I believe that is what is called doing a long stretch in 
prison!” 

Some of the group members laughed at Mr. Starkes’ joke. But Eddie and I 
exchanged solemn glances. 

Staring at the long wooden contraption with its thick ropes and straps, I 
pictured someone lying there. I imagined the creak of the wheel turning. And the 
ropes pulling tighter and tighter. 

Glancing up, my eye caught a dark figure standing on the other side of the 
Rack. He was very tall and very broad. Dressed in a long black cape, he had 
pulled a wide-brimmed hat down over his forehead, hiding most of his face in 
shadow. 

His eyes glowed darkly out from the shadow. 

Was he staring at me? 



I poked Eddie. “See that man over there? The one in black?” I whispered. 
“Is he in our group?” 

Eddie shook his head. “Eve never seen him before,” he whispered back. 
“He’s weird! Why is he staring at us like that?” 

The big man pulled the hat lower. His eyes disappeared beneath the wide 
brim. His black cape swirled as he stepped back into the shadows. 

Mr. Starkes continued to talk about the Rack. He asked if there were any 
volunteers to try it out. Everyone laughed. 

I’ve got to get a picture of this thing, I decided. My friends will really think 
it’s cool. 

I reached into my coat pocket for my camera. 

“Hey—!” I cried out in surprise. 

I searched the other pocket. Then I searched my jeans pockets. 

“I don’t believe this!” I cried. 

The camera was gone.

“Eddie—my camera!” I exclaimed. “Did you see—?” 

I stopped when I saw the mischievous grin on my brother’s face. 

He held up his hand—with my camera in it—and his grin grew wider. “The 
Mad Pickpocket strikes again!” he declared. 

“You took it from my pocket?” I wailed. I gave him a hard shove that sent 
him stumbling into the Rack. 

He burst out laughing. Eddie thinks he’s the world’s greatest pickpocket. 
That’s his hobby. Really. He practices all the time. 

“Fastest hands on Earth!” he bragged, waving the camera at me. 

I grabbed it away from him. “You’re obnoxious,” I told him. 

I don’t know why he enjoys being a thief so much. But he really is good at 
it. When he slid that camera from my coat pocket, I didn’t feel a thing. 

I started to tell him to keep his hands off my camera. But Mr. Starkes 
motioned for the group to follow him into the next room. 

As Eddie and I hurried to keep up, I glimpsed at the man in the black cape. 
He was lumbering up behind us, his face still hidden under the wide brim of his 
hat. 

I felt a stab of fear in my chest. Was the strange man watching Eddie and 
me? Why? 

No. He was probably just another tourist visiting the Tower. So why did I 
have the frightening feeling he was following us? 

I kept glancing back at him as Eddie and I studied the displays of torture 
devices in the next room. The man didn’t seem interested in the displays at all. 
He kept near the wall, his black cape fading into the deep shadows, his eyes 
straight ahead—on us! 

“Look at these!” Eddie urged, pushing me toward a display shelf. “What are 
these?” 

“Thumbscrews,” Mr. Starkes replied, stepping up behind us. He picked one 
up. “It looks like a ring,” he explained. “See? It slides down over your thumb 
like this.” 

He slid the wide metal ring over his thumb. Then he raised his hand so we 
could see clearly. “There is a screw in the side of the ring. Turn the screw, and it 



digs its way into your thumb. Keep turning it, and it digs deeper and deeper.” 
“Ouch!” I declared. 

“Very nasty,” Mr. Starkes agreed, setting the thumbscrew back on the 
display shelf. “This is a whole room of very nasty items.” 

“I can’t believe people were actually tortured with this stuff,” Eddie 
murmured. His voice trembled. He really didn’t like scary things—especially 
when they were real. 

“Wish I had a pair of these to use on you!” I teased. Eddie is such a wimp. 
Sometimes I can’t help myself. I have to give him a hard time. 

I reached behind the rope barrier and picked up a pair of metal handcuffs. 
They were heavier than I imagined. And they had a jagged row of metal spikes 
all around on the inside. 

“Sue—put those down!” Eddie whispered frantically. 

I slipped one around my wrist. “See, Eddie, when you clamp it shut, the 
jagged spikes cut into your wrist,” I told him. 

I let out a startled gasp as the heavy metal cuff clicked shut. 

“Ow!” I screamed, tugging frantically at it. “Eddie—help! I can’t get it off! 
It’s cutting me! It’s cutting me!” 



5 


“Ohhhh.” A horrified moan escaped Eddie’s throat as he gaped at the cuff around 
my wrist. His mouth dropped open, and his chin started to quiver. 

“Help me!” I wailed, thrashing my arm frantically, tugging at the chain. 
“Get me out of this!” 

Eddie turned as white as a ghost. 

I couldn’t keep a straight face any longer. I started to laugh. And I slid the 
handcuff off my wrist. 

“Gotcha back!” I jeered. “That’s for stealing my camera. Now we’re even!” 

“I—I—I—” Eddie sputtered. His dark eyes glowered at me angrily. “I 
really thought you were hurt,” he muttered. “Don’t do that again, Sue. I mean it.” 

I stuck my tongue out at him. I know it wasn’t very mature. My brother 
doesn’t always bring out the best in me. 

“Follow me, please!” Mr. Starkes’ voice echoed off the stone walls. Eddie 
and I moved closer as our tour group huddled around Mr. Starkes. 

“We’re going to climb the stairs to the north tower now,” the tour guide 
announced. “As you will see, the stairs are quite narrow and steep. So we will 
have to go single file. Please watch your step.” 

Mr. Starkes ducked his bald head as he led the way through a low, narrow 
doorway. Eddie and I were at the end of the line. 

The stone stairs twisted up the Tower like a corkscrew. There was no 
handrailing. And the stairs were so steep and so twisty, I had to hold on to the 
wall to keep my balance as I climbed. 

The air grew warmer as we made our way higher. So many feet had 
climbed these ancient stones, the stairs were worn smooth, the edges round. 

I tried to imagine prisoners being marched up these stairs to the Tower. 
Their legs must have trembled with fear. 

Up ahead, Eddie made his way slowly, peering up at the soot-covered stone 
walls. “It’s too dark,” he complained, turning back to me. “Hurry up, Sue. Don’t 
get too far behind.” 

My coat brushed against the stone wall as I climbed. I’m pretty skinny, but 
the stairway was so narrow, I kept bumping the sides. 

After climbing for what seemed like hours, we stopped on a landing. 



Straight ahead of us was a small dark cell behind metal bars. 

“This is a cell in which political prisoners were held,” Mr. Starkes told us. 
“Enemies of the king were brought here. You can see it was not the most 
comfortable place in the world.” 

Moving closer, I saw that the cell contained only a small stone bench and a 
wooden writing table. 

“What happened to these prisoners?” a white-haired woman asked Mr. 
Starkes. “Did they stay in this cell for years and years?” 

“No,” Mr. Starkes replied, rubbing his chin. “Most of them were beheaded.” 

I felt a chill at the back of my neck. I stepped up to the bars and peered into 
the small cell. 

Real people stood inside this cell, I thought. Real people held on to these 
bars and stared out. Sat at that little writing table. Paced back and forth in that 
narrow space. Waiting to meet their fate. 

Swallowing hard, I glanced at my brother. I could see that he was just as 
horrified as I was. 

“We have not reached the top of the Tower yet,” Mr. Starkes announced. 
“Let us continue our climb.” 

The stone steps became steeper as we made our way up the curving 
stairway. I trailed my hand along the wall as I followed Eddie up to the top. 

And as I climbed, I suddenly had the strangest feeling—that I had been here 
before. That I had followed the twisting stairs. That I had climbed to the top of 
this ancient tower before. 

Of course, that was impossible. 

Eddie and I had never been to England before in our lives. 

The feeling stayed with me as our tour group crowded into the tiny chamber 
at the top. Had I seen this tower in a movie? Had I seen pictures of it in a 
magazine? 

Why did it look so familiar to me? 

I shook my head hard, as if trying to shake away the strange, troubling 
thoughts. Then I stepped up beside Eddie and gazed around the tiny room. 

A small round window high above our heads allowed a wash of gloomy 
gray light to filter down over us. The rounded walls were bare, lined with cracks 
and dark stains. The ceiling was low, so low that Mr. Starkes and some of the 
other adults had to duck their heads. 

“Perhaps you can feel the sadness in this room,” Mr. Starkes said softly. 



We all huddled closer to hear him better. Eddie stared up at the window, his 
expression solemn. 

“This is the tower room where a young prince and princess were brought,” 
Mr. Starkes continued, speaking solemnly. “It was the early fifteenth century. 
The prince and princess—Edward and Susannah of York—were locked in this 
tiny tower cell.” 

He waved the red pennant in a circle. We all followed it, gazing around the 
small, cold room. “Imagine. Two children. Grabbed away from their home. 
Locked away in the drab chill of this cell in the top of a tower.” Mr. Starkes’ 
voice remained just above a whisper. 

I suddenly felt cold. I zipped my coat back up. Eddie had his hands shoved 
deep in his jeans pockets. His eyes grew wide with fear as he gazed around the 
tiny, dark room. 

“The prince and princess weren’t up here for long,” Mr. Starkes continued, 
lowering the pennant to his side. “That night while they slept, the Lord High 
Executioner and his men crept up the stairs. Their orders were to smother the 
two children. To keep the prince and princess from ever taking the throne.” 

Mr. Starkes shut his eyes and bowed his head. The silence in the room 
seemed to grow heavy. 

No one moved. No one spoke. 

The only sound was the whisper of wind through the tiny window above 
our heads. 

I shut my eyes, too. I tried to picture a boy and a girl. Frightened and alone. 
Trying to sleep in this cold, stone room. 

The door bursts open. Strange men break in. They don’t say a word. They 
msh to smother the boy and girl. 

Right in this room. 

Right where I am standing now, I thought. 

I opened my eyes. Eddie was gazing at me, his expression troubled. “This 
is... really scary,” he whispered. 

“Yeah,” I agreed. Mr. Starkes started to tell us more. 

But the camera fell out of my hand. It clattered noisily on the stone floor. I 
bent to pick it up. “Oh, look, Eddie—the lens broke!” I cried. 

“Ssshhh! I missed what Mr. Starkes said about the prince and princess!” 
Eddie protested. 

“But my camera—!” I shook it. I don’t know why. It’s not like shaking it 



would help fix the lens. 

“What did he say? Did you hear?” Eddie demanded. 

I shook my head. “Sorry. I missed it.” 

We walked over to a low cot against the wall. A three-legged wooden stool 
stood beside it. The only furniture in the chamber. 

Did the prince and princess sit here? I wondered. 

Did they stand on the bed and try to see out the window? 

What did they talk about? Did they wonder what was going to happen to 
them? Did they talk about the fun things they would do when they were freed? 
When they returned home? 

It was all so sad, so horribly sad. 

I stepped up to the cot and rested my hand on it. It felt hard. 

Black markings on the wall caught my eye. Writing? 

Had the prince or the princess left a message on the wall? 

I leaned over the cot and squinted at the markings. 

No. No message. Just cracks in the stone. 

“Sue—come on,” Eddie urged. He tugged my arm. 

“Okay, okay,” I replied impatiently. I ran my hand over the cot again. It felt 
so lumpy and hard, so uncomfortable. 

I gazed up at the window. The gray light had darkened to black. Dark as 
night out there. 

The stone walls suddenly seemed to close in on me. I felt as if I were in a 
dark closet, a cold, frightening closet. I imagined the walls squeezing in, choking 
me, smothering me. 

Is that how the prince and princess felt? 

Was I feeling the same fear they had known over five hundred years ago? 

With a heavy sigh, I let go of the cot and turned to Eddie. “Let’s get out of 
here,” I said in a trembling voice. “This room is just too frightening, too sad.” 

We turned away from the cot, took a few steps toward the stairs—and 
stopped. 

“Hey—!” We both cried out in surprise. 

Mr. Starkes and the tour group had disappeared.

“Where did they go?” Eddie cried in a shrill, startled voice. “They left us here!” 

“They must be on their way back down the stairs,” I told him. I gave him a 
gentle push. “Let’s go.” 

Eddie lingered close to me. “You go first,” he insisted quietly. 

“You’re not scared—are you?” I teased. “All alone in the Terror Tower?” 

I don’t know why I enjoy teasing my little brother so much. I knew he was 
scared. I was a little scared, too. But I couldn’t help it. 

As I said, Eddie doesn’t always bring out the best in me. 

I led the way to the twisting stairs. As I peered down, they seemed even 
darker and steeper. 

“Why didn’t we hear them leave?” Eddie demanded. “Why did they leave 
so fast?” 

“It’s late,” I told him. “I think Mr. Starkes was eager to get everyone on the 
bus and back to their hotels. The Tower closes at five, I think.” I glanced at my 
watch. It was five-twenty. 

“Hurry,” Eddie pleaded. “I don’t want to be locked in. This place gives me 
the creeps.” 

“Me, too,” I confessed. 

Squinting into the darkness, I started down the steps. My sneakers slid on 
the smooth stone. Once again, I pressed one hand against the wall. It helped me 
keep my balance on the curving stairs. 

“Where are they?” Eddie demanded nervously. “Why can’t we hear the 
others on the stairs?” 

The air grew cooler as we climbed lower. A pale yellow light washed over 
the landing just below us. 

My hand swept through something soft and sticky. Cobwebs. 

Yuck. 

I could hear Eddie’s rapid breathing behind me. “The bus will wait for us,” 
I told him. “Just stay calm. Mr. Starkes won’t drive off without us.” 

“Is anybody down there?” Eddie screamed. “Can anybody hear me?” 

His shrill voice echoed down the narrow stone stairwell. 

No reply. 



“Where are the guards?” Eddie demanded. 

“Eddie—please don’t get worked up,” I pleaded. “It’s late. The guards are 
probably closing up. Mr. Starkes will be waiting for us down there. I promise 
you.” 

We stepped into the pale light of the landing. 

The small cell we had seen before stood against the wall. 

“Don’t stop,” Eddie pleaded, breathing hard. “Keep going, Sue. Hurry!” 

I put my hand on his shoulder to calm him. “Eddie, we’ll be fine,” I said 
soothingly. “We’re almost down to the ground.” 

“But, look—” Eddie protested. He pointed frantically. 

I saw at once what was troubling him. There were two stairways leading 
down—one to the left of the cell, and one to the right. 

“That’s strange,” I uttered, glancing from one to the other. “I don’t 
remember a second stairway.” 

“Wh-which one is the right one?” he stammered. 

I hesitated. “I’m not sure,” I replied. I stepped over to the one on the right 
and peered down. I couldn’t see very far because it curved so sharply. 

“Which one? Which one?” Eddie repeated. 

“I don’t think it matters,” I told him. “I mean, they both lead down —right?” 

I motioned for him to follow me. “Come on. I think this is the one we took 
when we were climbing up.” 

I took one step down. 

Then stopped. 

I heard footsteps. Heavy footsteps. Coming up the stairs. 

Eddie grabbed my hand. “Who’s that?” he whispered. 

“Probably Mr. Starkes,” I told him. “He must be coming back up to get us.” 

Eddie breathed a long sigh of relief. 

“Mr. Starkes—is that you?” I called down. 

Silence. Except for the approaching footsteps. 

“Mr. Starkes?” I called in a tiny voice. 

When the dark figure appeared on the stairway below, I could see at once 
that it wasn’t our tour guide. 

“Oh!” I uttered a startled cry as the huge man in the black cape stepped into 

view. 

His face was still hidden in darkness. But his eyes glowed like burning 
coals as he glared up at Eddie and me from under the black, wide-brimmed hat. 



“Is—is this the way down?” I stammered. 

He didn’t reply. 

He didn’t move. His eyes burned into mine. 

I struggled to see his face. But he kept it hidden in the shadow of the hat, 
pulled low over his forehead. 

I took a deep breath and tried again. “We got separated from our group,” I 
said. “They must be waiting for us. Is—is this the way down?” 

Again, he didn’t reply. He glared up at us menacingly. 

He’s so big, I realized. He blocks the entire stairway. 

“Sir—?” I started. “My brother and I—” 

He raised a hand. A huge hand, covered in a black glove. 

He pointed up at us. 

“You will come with me now,” he growled. 

I just stared at him. I didn’t understand. 

“You will come now,” he repeated. “I do not want to hurt you. But if you 
try to escape, I will have no choice.”

Eddie let out a sharp gasp. 

My mouth dropped open as the man edged closer. 

And then I realized who he was. “You’re a guard here—right?” I asked. 

He didn’t reply. 

“You—you scared me,” I said, letting out a shrill laugh. “I mean, that 
costume and everything. You work here—right?” 

He stepped forward, bringing his black-gloved hands up in front of him, 
moving the fingers. 

“I’m sorry we’re here so late,” I continued. “We lost our group. I guess you 
want to close up so you can go home.” 

He took another step closer. His eyes flared darkly. “You know why I am 
here,” he snarled. 

“No. I don’t. I—” My words were cut off as he grabbed me by the shoulder. 

“Hey—let go of her!” Eddie cried. 

But the caped man grabbed my brother, too. 

His gloved fingers dug sharply into my shoulder. “Hey—!” I cried out in 

pain. 

He backed us against the cold stone wall. 

I caught a glimpse of his face, a hard, angry face. A long, sharp nose, thin 
lips twisted in a snarl. And the eyes. The cold, glowing eyes. 

“Let us go!” Eddie demanded bravely. 

“We have to meet our group!” I told the man shrilly. “We’re leaving now. 
You can’t keep us here!” 

He ignored our pleas. “Do not move,” he uttered in a low growl. “Stand 
there. Do not try to escape.” 

“Listen, sir—if we’ve done something wrong...” My voice trailed off. 

I watched him reach into the folds of his black cape. He struggled for a 
moment, then pulled something out. 

At first I thought they were rubber balls. Three of them. 

But as he clicked them together, I realized he was holding smooth, white 
stones. 



What is going on here? I asked myself. 

Is he crazy? 

Crazy and dangerous ? 

“Listen, sir—” Eddie started. “We have to go now.” 

“Don’t move!” the caped man screamed. He shoved his cape violently 
behind him. “Don’t move—and don’t make a sound. You have my final 
warning!” 

Eddie and I exchanged frightened glances. My back against the stone wall, I 
tried edging slowly toward the nearest stairway. 

Mumbling to himself, the man concentrated on the three smooth white 
stones. He piled one on top of the other. 

He let out an angry cry as one of the stones fell to the floor. It bounced once 
and slid across the smooth floor. 

This is our chance! I thought. 

I shoved Eddie toward the other stairwell. “Run!” I screamed. 



8 


“Do not move!” the man bellowed, grabbing up the stone. He had a booming 
voice that thundered off the stone walls. “I warned you. You cannot escape me!” 

My brother’s eyes were bugging out of his head. But he didn’t have to be 
told twice to run! 

“Stop!” the caped man bellowed. The booming voice followed us as we 
scrambled down, stumbling on the twisting, curving stairs, our hands trailing 
against the cold stone of the tower wall. 

Down, down. 

Turning so fast, my head spun. But I squinted into the dim light and forced 
myself not to be dizzy, not to fall, not to give in to the terror that rose up over 
me. 

My camera fell out of my coat pocket. It clattered down the stairs. I didn’t 
stop to pick it up. It was broken, anyway. 

“Keep going,” I urged Eddie. “Keep going! We’re almost out of here!” 

Or were we? 

The climb down seemed so much longer. 

Our sneakers slapped against the stone steps. But even louder were the 
heavy footsteps of the caped man behind us. His bellowed cries boomed down 
the narrow tower, echoed all around us—as if we were being chased by a 
hundred frightening men instead of one. 

Who is he? 

Why is he chasing us? 

Why is he so angry? 

The questions bounced through my mind as I scrambled frantically down, 
following the twisting stairs. 

No time for answers. 

The big, gray door rose up in front of us before we could stop. 

Eddie and I both ran right into it. 

“The exit! We—we’re here!” I stammered. I could hear the rumble of the 
man’s footsteps above us on the stairway. Coming closer. Closer. 

We’re out! I thought. We’re safe! 

Eddie shoved the door hard with his shoulder. Shoved it again. 



He turned to me, his chin quivering in fright. “It’s locked. We’re locked in!” 
“No!” I screamed. “Push!” 

We both lowered our shoulders and pushed with all our strength. 

No. 

The door didn’t budge. 

The man lumbered closer. So close, we could hear his muttered words. 
We’re trapped, I realized. 

He’s caught us. 

Why does he want us? What is he going to do? 

“One more try,” I managed to choke out. 

Eddie and I turned back to the door. 

“Stay there!” the caped man commanded. 

But Eddie and I gave the door one more desperate shove. 

And it finally moved, scraping the stone floor as it slid open partway. 

Eddie sucked in his breath and pushed through the opening first. Then I 
squeezed through. 

Panting hard, we shoved the door shut behind us. The door had a long metal 
bar on the outside. I slid it all the way, bolting it. Locking the caped man inside. 
“We’re safe!” I cried, spinning away from the door. 

But we weren’t outside. We were in a huge, dark room. 

And a cruel voice—in the room with us—a man’s voice, laughing softly— 
told me that we weren’t out of trouble. 



9 


The laughter rose up in front of us, making us both gasp. 

“You have entered the king’s dungeon. Abandon all hope,” the man 
declared. 

“Who—who are you?” I cried. 

But more laughter was the only reply. 

A single beam of pale green light from the low ceiling broke the darkness. 
Huddled close to Eddie, I squinted in the eerie glow, desperate to find a way to 
escape. 

“Over there! Look!” Eddie whispered, pointing. 

Across the room, I could see a barred cell against the wall. 

We crept forward a few steps. Then we saw it. 

A bony hand reaching out from between the bars. 

“No!” I gasped. 

Eddie and I jumped back. 

The pounding on the door behind us made us both jump again. “You cannot 
escape!” the caped man raged from the other side of the door. 

Eddie grabbed my hand as the man furiously pounded on the door. The 
sound boomed louder than thunder. 

Would the bolt hold? 

Ahead of us, two bony hands reached out from another dungeon cell. 

“This can’t be happening!” Eddie choked out. “There aren’t any dungeons 
today!” 

“Another doorway!” I whispered, trembling with fright as I stared at the 
hands poking out from the dark cells. “Find another doorway.” 

My eyes frantically searched the darkness. Off in a distant corner, I 
glimpsed a slender crack of light. 

I started to run toward it—and tripped over something. Something chained 
to the floor. 

It was a body. A body of a man sprawled on the floor. And I landed on his 
chest with a sickening thud. 

The chains rattled loudly as my foot tangled in them. 



My knees and elbows hit the stone floor hard. Pain shot through my entire 
body. 

The old man didn’t move. 

I scrambled up. Stared down at him. 

And realized he was a dummy. 

Not real. Just a dummy, chained to the floor. 

“Eddie—it’s not real!” I cried. 

“Huh?” He stared at me, his face twisted in confusion, in fright. 

“It’s not real! None of it!” I repeated. “Look! The hands in the dungeon 
cells—they’re not moving! It’s all a display, Eddie. Just a display!” 

Eddie started to reply. But the cruel laughter interrupted him. 

“You have entered the king’s dungeon. Abandon all hope,” the voice 
repeated. Then more evil laughter. 

Just a tape. Just a recording. 

There wasn’t anyone in the room with us. No dungeon keeper. 

I let out a long sigh. My heart was still pounding like a bass drum. But I felt 
a little better knowing that we weren’t trapped in a real dungeon. 

“We’re okay,” I assured Eddie. 

And then the door burst open with a loud crack. And the big man roared 
into the room, his cape fluttering behind him, his dark eyes glowing in victory. 



10 


Eddie and I froze in the middle of the floor. 

The caped man froze, too. The only sound was his harsh, raspy breathing. 

We stared through the dim light at each other. Frozen like the dummies in 
the cells. 

“You cannot escape,” the man growled once again. “You know you will not 
leave the castle.” 

His words sent a cold shiver down my back. 

“Leave us alone!” Eddie pleaded in a tiny voice. 

“What do you want?” I demanded. “Why are you chasing us?” 

The big man pressed his gloved hands against his waist. “You know the 
answer,” he replied flatly. He took a step toward Eddie and me. “Are you ready 
to come with me now?” he demanded. 

I didn’t reply. Instead, I leaned close to Eddie and whispered, “Get ready to 

run.” 

Eddie continued to stare straight ahead. He didn’t blink or nod his head. I 
couldn’t tell if he had even heard me. 

“You know you have no choice,” the man said softly. He reached both 
hands into the folds of his cape. Once again, he pulled out the mysterious white 
stones. And once again, I caught a glimpse of his dark eyes, saw the cold sneer 
on his lips. 

“You—you’ve made a mistake!” Eddie stammered. 

The man shook his head. The wide brim of the black hat cast tilting 
shadows on the floor. “I have made no mistake. Do not run from me again. You 
know you must come with me now.” 

Eddie and I didn’t need a signal. 

Without saying a word to each other, without glancing at each other, we 
spun around—and started to run. 

The man shouted in protest and took off after us. 

The room seemed to stretch on forever. It must be the entire basement of 
the castle, I realized. 

Beyond the beam of light, the darkness rose up like fog. 

My fear weighed me down. My legs felt as if they were a thousand pounds 



each. 

I’m moving in slow motion, I thought, struggling to speed up. Eddie and I 
are crawling like turtles. 

He’ll catch us. He’ll catch us in two seconds. 

I glanced back when I heard the caped man cry out. He had tripped over the 
same dummy chained to the floor. He had fallen heavily. 

As he scrambled to his feet, my eyes searched the far wall for a door. Or a 
hallway. Or any kind of opening. 

“How—how do we get out of here?” Eddie cried. “We’re trapped, Sue!” 

“No!” I cried. I spotted a worktable against the wall. Cluttered with tools. I 
searched for something to use as a weapon. Didn’t see anything. Grabbed a 
flashlight, instead. 

Frantically pushed the button. 

Would it work? 

Yes. 

A white beam of light darted over the floor. I raised it to the far wall. “Eddie 
—look!” I whispered. 

A low opening in the wall. Some kind of tunnel? A tunnel we could escape 
through? 

In another second, we were ducking our heads and stepping into the dark 
opening. 

I kept my light ahead of us, down at our feet. We had to stoop as we ran. 
The tunnel was curved at the top, and not high enough for us to stand. 

The tunnel ran straight for a while, then curved down and to the right. The 
air felt damp and cool. I could hear the trickle of water nearby. 

“It’s an old sewer,” I told Eddie. “That means it has to lead us out 
somewhere.” 

“I hope so,” Eddie replied breathlessly. 

Running hard, we followed the curve of the sewer. My light leaped about, 
jumping from the low ceiling to the damp stone floor. 

The light revealed wide metal rungs hanging from the ceiling. Eddie and I 
had to duck even lower to keep from smashing our heads against them. 

The light from my flashlight bounced wildly from the floor to the rungs 
along the top of the sewer. Eddie and I splashed through puddles of dirty water. 

We both gasped when we heard the footsteps behind us. 

Heavy, ringing footsteps. Thundering in the low tunnel. Growing louder. 



Louder. 

I glanced back. But the caped man was hidden by the curve of the sewer 
tunnel. 

His footsteps boomed steadily, rapidly. I could tell he wasn’t far behind. 

He’s going to catch us, I told myself in a panic. 

This tunnel is never going to end. 

Eddie and I can’t run much farther. 

He’s going to catch us in this dark, damp sewer. 

And then what? 

What does he want? 

Why did he say that we knew what he wanted? 

How could we know? 

I stumbled forward. The flashlight bumped against the wall and fell from 
my hand. 

It clattered to the tunnel floor and rolled in front of me. 

The light shone back into the tunnel, back toward the caped man. 

I saw him move into view, bent low, running hard. 

“Ohhh.” A frightened moan escaped my lips. 

I bent to pick up the flashlight. It slid out of my trembling hand. 

That was all the time the caped man needed. 

He grabbed Eddie with both hands. He pulled the black cape around my 
brother, trapping him. 

Then he reached for me. “I told you—there is no escape,” he rasped. 



11 


I ducked out of the caped man’s grasp. 

With another frightened groan, I grabbed the flashlight off the floor. 

I planned to use it as a weapon. To shine it in the caped man’s eyes. Or 
swing it at his head. 

But I didn’t get a chance. 

I froze in horror as the beam of light bounced down the tunnel—and I saw 
the rats. 

Hundreds of them. Hundreds of chittering gray rats. 

The darting light made their eyes glow red as fire. The rats came scrabbling 
over the sewer floor. Snapping their jaws hungrily, gnashing their jagged teeth as 
they came charging at us. 

Their shrill whistling and chittering echoed through the tunnel. The 
terrifying sound made my breath catch in my throat. 

The tiny red eyes glowed in the light as they scrabbled toward us. As they 
pulled their scrawny bodies over the hard floor, their tails slithered behind them 
like dark snakes. 

The caped man saw them, too. He leaped back in surprise. 

And Eddie came tearing out from under the cape. He gulped in shock as his 
eyes locked on the charging rats. 

“Jump!” I cried. “Eddie—jump!” 

Eddie didn’t move. We both gaped at the rats in horror. A churning sea of 
whistling, chewing, red-eyed rats. A living tidal wave of rats. 

“Jump! Jump—now!” I shrieked. 

I raised both hands. Jumped. 

Eddie jumped, too. We grabbed on to the metal bars imbedded in the sewer 

roof. 

Pulling myself up, I frantically lifted my feet as high as I could from the 
floor. 

Higher. Higher. As the rats charged underneath me. 

A foul odor rose up, nearly choking me as the rats ran past. 

I could hear the tap tap tap of their long toenails against the floor. Hear the 
swish of their sweeping tails. 



I couldn’t see the rats in the darkness. But I could hear them. And feel 
them. They jumped at my shoes. Scratched at my legs with their sharp claws. 
And kept coming. 

I turned to see the caped man start to run back. 

He stumbled with lurching steps as he tried to flee the thundering wave of 
rats. His arms shot forward as if reaching for safety. The black cape whipped up 
behind him. 

The wide-brimmed hat flew off his head and floated to the floor. A dozen 
rats pounced on it, climbed all over it, and began chewing it to pieces. 

The man’s footsteps echoed in the tunnel as he ran faster. Rats leaped up at 
his cape, clawing it, snapping their jaws, and shrieking excitedly. 

A second later, he disappeared around the curve of the sewer. 

The rats scrambled noisily after him. As they vanished around the curve, 
the sounds all blended together, became a roar, a roar that rang through the long 
sewer. 

A roar of horror. 

My arms were both aching, throbbing with pain. But I kept my feet high off 
the floor. I didn’t let go of the metal rung until I was sure all the rats had 
disappeared. 

The roar faded into the distance. 

I heard Eddie’s heavy breathing. He let out a sharp groan and dropped to 
the floor. 

I let go of the bar and lowered myself, too. I waited for my heart to stop 
pounding, for the blood to stop throbbing at my temples. 

“That was a close call,” Eddie murmured. His chin trembled. His face was 
as gray as the tunnel walls. 

I shuddered. I knew I’d see the hundreds of tiny red eyes in my dreams, 
hear the clicking of their long toenails and the swish of their scraggly tails. 

“Let’s get out of this disgusting sewer!” I cried. “Mr. Starkes must be 
frantic searching for us.” 

Eddie picked up the flashlight and handed it to me. “I can’t wait to get back 
on the tour bus,” he said. “I can’t wait to get away from this awful tower. I can’t 
believe we’ve been chased by a crazy person through a sewer. This can’t really 
be happening to us, Sue!” 

“It’s happening,” I declared, shaking my head. I suddenly had another 
thought. “Mom and Dad are probably out of their meeting,” I said. “They’re 



probably worried sick about us.” 

“Not as worried as lam!” Eddie exclaimed. 

I beamed the light ahead, keeping it down on the sewer floor, and we started 
walking. The tunnel floor rose up and curved to the left. We started to climb. 

“There’s got to be an end to this sewer,” I muttered. “It’s got to end 
somewhere! ” 

A faint roar up ahead made me cry out. 

More rats! 

Eddie and I both stopped. And listened. 

“Hey—!” I uttered excitedly when I realized it was a different sound. 

The sound of wind rushing into the tunnel. 

That meant we had to be close to the end. And that the sewer emptied 
somewhere outside. 

“Let’s go!” I cried excitedly. The beam of light bounced ahead of us as we 
started to run. 

The tunnel curved again. And then suddenly ended. 

I saw a metal ladder, reaching straight up. Straight up to a large, round hole 
in the tunnel ceiling. Gazing up at the hole, I saw the night sky. 

Eddie and I let out shouts of joy. He scrambled up the ladder, and I pulled 
myself up right behind him. 

It was a cold, damp night. But we didn’t care. The air smelled so fresh and 
clean. 

And we were out. Out of the sewer. Out of the Terror Tower. 

Away from that frightening man in the black cape. 

I gazed around quickly, trying to figure out where we were. The Tower 
tilted up toward us, a black shadow against the blue-black sky. 

The lights had all been turned off. The tiny guardhouse lay dark and empty. 
Not another soul in sight. 

I saw the low wall that divided the Tower from the rest of the world. And 
then I found the stone path that led to the exit and the parking lot. 

Our shoes thudded over the smooth stones as we hurried toward the parking 
lot. A pale half-moon slid out from behind wispy clouds. It cast a shimmering 
silver light over the whispering trees and the long stone wall. 

It all suddenly looked unreal. 

Without stopping, I glanced back at the old castle. The moonlight shone off 
the jutting towers, as if casting them in a pale spotlight. 



Real people walked on this path hundreds of years ago, I thought. 

And real people died up in that tower. 

With a shiver, I turned back and kept jogging. Eddie and I moved through 
the open gate and out past the wall. 

We’re back in modern times, I thought. Back where we are safe. 

But our happiness didn’t last long. 

The parking lot shimmered darkly in the pale moonlight. Empty. 

The tour bus was gone. 

Eddie and I both turned to search up and down the street. The long, empty 
street. 

“They left us,” Eddie murmured with a sigh. “How are we going to get back 
to the hotel?” 

I started to answer—but stopped when I saw the man. 

A tall, white-haired man, limping toward us, moving fast, pointing and 
calling, “You there! You there!” 

Oh, no, I thought wearily, feeling my body freeze in fear. 

Now what? 



12 


“You there! You there!” 

The man’s shoulder dipped in the big, gray overcoat he wore as he charged 
at us, limping with each step. 

Eddie and I huddled close together, staring back at him as he hurried across 
the empty parking lot. His white hair tumbled out from under a small gray cap. 
The overcoat hung down nearly to his ankles and bulged over his skinny frame. 

He stepped up in front of us and waited to catch his breath. His tiny eyes 
caught the moonlight as he narrowed them at us, studying Eddie, then me. 

“Are you the two kids that bus driver was looking for?” he asked in a shrill, 
high voice. He had a different accent from Mr. Starkes’. I think it was Scottish. 

Eddie and I nodded. 

“Well, I’m the night guard here,” the man told us. “There’s no one here but 
me after closing.” 

“Uh... where is our bus?” Eddie asked quietly. 

“It left,” the man replied sharply. “He searched all over for you. But he 
couldn’t wait any longer. What happened? Did you get lost in there?” He 
motioned back toward the Tower. 

“A man chased us,” Eddie replied breathlessly. “He said we had to come 
with him. He was really scary, and—” 

“Man? What man?” The night guard eyed us suspiciously. 

“The man in the black cape!” I replied. “And the black hat. He chased us. In 
the Tower.” 

“There’s no man in the tower,” the guard replied, shaking his head. “I told 
you. I’m the only one here after closing.” 

“But he’s in there!” I cried. “He chased us! He was going to hurt us! He 
chased us through the sewer and the rats—” 

“Sewer? What were you two doing in the sewer?” the guard demanded. 
“We have rules here about where tourists are allowed. If you break the rules, we 
can’t be responsible.” 

He sighed. “Now you come out here with a wild story about a man in a 
black cape. And running through the sewers. Wild stories. Wild stories.” 

Eddie and I exchanged glances. We could both see that this man wasn’t 



going to believe us. 

“How do we get back to our hotel?” Eddie asked. “Our parents will be 
really worried.” 

I glanced at the street. There were no cars or buses in sight. 

“Do you have any money?” the guard asked, replacing his cap. “There’s a 
phone box on the corner. I can call for a taxi.” 

I reached into my jeans pocket and felt the heavy coins my parents had 
given me before Eddie and I set out on the tour. Then I breathed a long sigh of 
relief. 

“We have money,” I told the guard. 

“It’ll cost you at least fifteen or twenty pounds from way out here,” he 
warned. 

“That’s okay,” I replied. “Our parents gave us British money. If we don’t 
have enough, my parents will pay the driver.” 

He nodded. Then he turned to Eddie. “You look all done in, lad. Did you 
get frightened up in that tower?” 

Eddie swallowed hard. “I just want to get back to our hotel,” he murmured. 

The guard nodded. Then, tucking his hands into the pockets of the big 
overcoat, he led the way to the phone booth. 

The black taxi pulled up about ten minutes later. The driver was a young man 
with long, wavy blond hair. “What hotel?” he asked, leaning out the passenger 
window. 

“The Barclay,” I told him. 

Eddie and I climbed into the back. It was warm in the taxi. It felt so great to 
sit down! 

As we pulled away from the Terror Tower, I didn’t glance back. I never 
wanted to see that old castle again. 

The car rolled smoothly through the dark streets. The taxi meter clicked 
pleasantly. The driver hummed to himself. 

I shut my eyes and leaned my head back against the leather seat. I tried not 
to think about the frightening man who had chased us in the Tower. But I 
couldn’t force him from my mind. 

Soon we were back in the center of London. Cars and taxis jammed the 
streets. We passed brightly lit theaters and restaurants. 

The taxi pulled up to the front of the Barclay Hotel and eased to a stop. The 



driver slid open the window behind his seat and turned to me. “That’ll be fifteen 
pounds, sixty pence.” 

Eddie sat up drowsily. He blinked several times, surprised to see that we 
had reached our destination. 

I pulled the big, heavy coins from my pocket. I held them up to the driver. 
“I don’t really know what is what,” I confessed. “Can you take the right amount 
from these?” 

The driver glanced at the coins in my hands, sniffed, then raised his eyes to 
me. “What are those?” he asked coldly. 

“Coins,” I replied. I didn’t know what else to say. “Do I have enough to pay 
you?” 

He stared back at me. “Do you have any real money? Or are you going to 
pay me with play money?” 

“I—I don’t understand,” I stammered. My hand started to tremble, and I 
nearly dropped the coins. 

“I don’t either,” the driver replied sharply. “But I do know that those aren’t 
real coins. We use British pounds here, miss.” 

His expression turned angry. He glared at me through the little window in 
the glass partition. “Now, are you going to pay me in British pounds, or are we 
going to have some major trouble? I want my money—now!” 



13 


I pulled the coins away from him and raised them close to my face. It was dark 
in the back of the taxi, and hard to see. 

The coins were large and round. They felt heavy, made of real gold or 
silver. It was too dark to read the words on them. 

“Why would my parents give me play money?” I asked the driver. 

He shrugged. “I don’t know your parents.” 

“Well, they will pay you the fifteen pounds,” I told him. I struggled to 
shove the big coins back into my pocket. 

“Fifteen pounds, sixty—plus tip,” the driver said, frowning at me. “Where 
are your parents? In the hotel?” 

I nodded. “Yes. They were at a meeting in the hotel. But they’re probably 
up in the room now. We’ll get them to come down and pay you.” 

“In real money, if you please,” the driver said, rolling his eyes. “If they’re 
not down here in five minutes, I’ll come in after you.” 

“They’ll be right down. I promise,” I told him. 

I pushed open the door and scrambled out of the cab. Eddie followed me 
onto the sidewalk, shaking his head. “This is weird,” he muttered. 

A red-uniformed doorman held the hotel door open for us, and we hurried 
into the huge, chandeliered lobby. Most people seemed to be heading the other 
way, going out for dinner, I guessed. 

My stomach grumbled. I suddenly realized I was starving. 

Eddie and I made our way past the long front desk. We were walking so 
fast, we nearly collided with a bellman pushing a big cart stacked high with 
suitcases. 

To our right, I could hear dishes clattering in the hotel restaurant. The 
aroma of fresh-baked bread floated in the air. 

The elevator doors opened. A red-haired woman in a fur coat stepped off, 
walking a white toy poodle. Eddie got tangled in the leash. I had to pull him free 
so we wouldn’t miss the elevator. 

We stumbled into the elevator. As the doors slid shut, I pushed Six. “What 
was wrong with that money?” Eddie asked. 

I shrugged. “I don’t know. I guess Dad made a mistake.” 



The doors slid open on six, and we hurried side by side down the long, 
carpeted hall to our room. 

I stepped around a room service tray on the floor. Someone had left half a 
sandwich and part of a bowl of fruit. My stomach rumbled again, reminding me 
how hungry I was. 

“Here we are.” Eddie ran up to the door to room 626 and knocked. “Hey, 
Mom! Dad! It’s us!” 

“Open up!” I called impatiently. 

Eddie knocked again, a little louder. “Hey—!” 

We pressed our ears close to the door and listened. 

Silence. No footsteps. No voices. 

“Hey—are you in there?” Eddie called. He knocked again. “Hurry up! It’s 

us!” 

He turned to me. “They must be out of that meeting by now,” he muttered. 

I cupped my hands around my mouth. “Mom? Dad? Are you there?” I 
called in. 

No reply. 

Eddie’s shoulders slumped, and he let out an unhappy sigh. “Now what?” 

“Are you having trouble?” a woman’s voice asked. 

I turned to see a hotel maid. She wore a gray uniform and a small white cap 
over her short, dark hair. She had been pushing a cart loaded with towels. She 
stopped across from Eddie and me. 

“Our parents are still at a meeting,” I told her. “My brother and I—we’re 
locked out.” 

She studied us for a moment. Then she stepped away from the cart and 
raised a large keychain filled with keys. 

“I’m not really supposed to do this,” she said, shuffling through the 
clattering keys. “But I guess it’s okay to let you kids in.” 

She put a key into the lock, turned it, and pushed open the door for us. 
Eddie and I both thanked her and told her she was a lifesaver. She smiled and 
moved on down the hall, pushing her towel cart. 

The room was dark. I clicked on the light as Eddie and I stepped in. 

“They’re not here,” I said softly. “No sign of them.” 

“They probably left a note,” Eddie replied. “Maybe they had to go out with 
people from the meeting. Or maybe they’re down in the restaurant, waiting for 



Our room was actually a suite. A front room and two bedrooms. 

Turning on lights as I went, I made my way to the desk in the corner. A 
writing pad and pen rested in the center of the desk. But the pad was blank. No 
message. 

No message from Mom or Dad on the bedtable, either. 

“That’s weird,” Eddie muttered. 

I crossed the room and stepped into their bedroom. I clicked on the ceiling 
light and glanced around. 

The room had been made up. The bed was smooth and unwrinkled. There 
was no message for us anywhere. The dressertop lay bare. No clothes tossed 
over a chair. No shoes on the floor. No briefcases or notepads from their 
meeting. 

No sign that anyone had even been in the room. 

I turned and saw that Eddie had moved to the closet. He pushed the sliding 
door open all the way. 

“Sue, look!” he shouted. “No clothes! Mom’s and Dad’s clothes—our 
clothes—they’re all gone!” 

A heavy feeling of dread started in my stomach and weighted down my 
entire body. “What is going on here?” I cried. 



14 


“They wouldn’t just leave!” I exclaimed. I walked over to the closet and checked 
it out for myself. I don’t know what I expected to see. It was clear from across 
the room that the closet was completely empty. 

“Are you sure we’re in the right room?” Eddie asked. He pulled open the 
top dresser drawer. Empty. 

“Of course this is the right room,” I replied impatiently. 

Eddie pulled out the rest of the dresser drawers. They were all empty. 

We searched every inch of the room. No sign of Mom or Dad. 

“We’d better go down to the desk,” I suggested, thinking hard. “We’ll find 
out what room the meeting is being held in. Then we’ll go there and talk to Mom 
and Dad.” 

“I can’t believe they’re still at the meeting,” Eddie murmured, shaking his 
head. “And why would they pack up and take all our clothes to the meeting with 
them?” 

“I’m sure there’s a good answer,” I said. “Come on. Let’s go downstairs.” 

We made our way back down the long hall and took the elevator to the 
lobby. 

We found a crowd around the front desk. A large woman, dressed in a green 
pantsuit, was arguing angrily about her room. “I was promised a view of the 
river,” she screamed at the red-faced man behind the desk. “And I want a view 
of the river!” 

“But, madam,” he replied softly, “the hotel is not located near the river. We 
do not have any river views from this hotel.” 

“I must have a river view!” the woman insisted. “I have it right here in 
writing!” She flashed a sheet of paper in front of the man’s face. 

The argument continued for a few minutes more. I quickly lost interest in it. 
I thought about Mom and Dad. I wondered where they were. I wondered why 
they hadn’t left us a note or a message. 

Eddie and I finally got up to the desk about ten minutes later. The clerk 
tucked some papers into a file, then turned to us with an automatic smile. “Can I 
help you?” 

“We’re trying to find our parents,” I said, leaning my elbows on the desk. 



“They’re in the meeting, I think. Can you tell us where the meeting is?” 

He stared at me for a long moment, his face blank, as if he didn’t 
understand. “What meeting is that?” he asked finally. 

I thought hard. I couldn’t remember what the meeting was called. Or what it 
was about. 

“It’s the big meeting,” I replied uncertainly. “The one people came from all 
over the world for.” 

He twisted his mouth into a thoughtful pout. “Hmmm...” 

“Avery big meeting,” Eddie chimed in. 

“We have a problem,” the clerk said, frowning. He scratched his right ear. 
“There aren’t any meetings in the hotel this week.” 

I stared back at him. My mouth dropped open. I started to say something, 
but the words just didn’t come out. 

“No meetings?” Eddie asked weakly. 

The clerk shook his head. “No meetings.” 

A young woman called to him from the office. He signaled to me that he’d 
be right back. Then he hurried over to see what she wanted. 

“Are we in the right hotel?” Eddie whispered to me. I could see the worry 
tighten his features. 

“Of course,” I said sharply. “Why do you keep asking me these dumb 
questions? I’m not an idiot, you know. Why do you keep asking, is this the right 
room? Is this the right hotel?” 

“Because nothing makes sense,” he muttered. 

I started to reply, but the clerk returned to the desk. “May I ask your room 
number?” he demanded, scratching his ear again. 

“Six twenty-six,” I told him. 

He punched several keys on his computer keyboard, then squinted at the 
green monitor. “I’m sorry. That room is vacant,” he said. 

“What?” I cried. 

The clerk studied me, narrowing his eyes. “There is no one in room 626 at 
the present,” he repeated. 

“But we are!” Eddie cried. 

The clerk forced a smile to his face. He raised both hands, as if to say, 
“Let’s all remain calm.” 

“We will find your parents,” he told us, leaving the smile frozen on his face. 
He punched a few computer keys. “Now, what is your last name?” 



I opened my mouth to answer. But no answer came to my mind. 

I glanced at Eddie. His face was knitted in concentration. 

“What is your last name, kids?” the clerk repeated. “If your parents are in 
the hotel, I’m sure we can track them down for you. But I need to know your last 
name.” 

I stared blankly at him. 

I had a strange, tingly feeling that started at the back of my neck and ran all 
the way down my body. I suddenly felt as if I couldn’t breathe, as if my heart 
had stopped. 

My last name. My last name... 

Why couldn’t I remember my last name? 

I could feel my body start to shake. Tears brimmed in my eyes. 

This was so upsetting! 

My name is Sue, I told myself. Sue... Sue... what? 

Shaking, tears running down my cheeks, I grabbed Eddie by the shoulders. 
“Eddie,” I demanded, “what’s our last name?” 

“I—I don’t know!” he sobbed. 

“Oh, Eddie!” I pulled my brother close and hugged him. “What’s wrong 
with us? What’s wrong with us?” 



15 


“We have to stay calm,” I told my brother. “If we take a deep breath and just 
relax, I’m sure we’ll be able to remember.” 

“I guess you’re right,” Eddie replied uncertainly. He stared straight ahead. 
He was gritting his teeth, trying hard not to cry. 

It was a few minutes later. The desk clerk had suggested that we go to the 
hotel restaurant. He promised he’d try to find our parents while we ate. 

That suggestion was fine with Eddie and me. We were both starving! 

We sat at a small table in the back of the restaurant. I gazed around the big, 
elegant room. Crystal chandeliers cast sparkling light over the well-dressed 
diners. On a small balcony overlooking the room, a string quartet played 
classical music. 

Eddie tapped his hands nervously on the white tablecloth. I kept picking up 
the heavy silverware and twirling it in my hand. 

The tables all around us were filled with laughing, happy people. Three 
children at the next table, very dressed up, were singing a song in French to their 
smiling parents. 

Eddie leaned over the table and whispered to me. “How are we going to pay 
for the food? Our money isn’t any good.” 

“We can charge it to the room,” I replied. “When we figure out what room 
we’re in.” Eddie nodded and slouched back in his high-backed chair. 

A waiter in a black tuxedo appeared beside the table. He smiled at Eddie 
and me. “Welcome to the Barclay,” he said. “And what may I bring you this 
evening?” 

“Could we see a menu?” I asked. 

“There is no menu right now,” the waiter replied, without changing his 
smile. “We are still serving tea.” 

“Only tea?” Eddie cried. “No food?” 

The waiter chuckled. “Our high tea includes sandwiches, scones, croissants, 
and an assortment of pastries.” 

“Yes. We’ll have that,” I told him. 

He gave a quick bow of his head, turned, and headed toward the kitchen. 

“At least we’ll get something to eat,” I murmured. 



Eddie didn’t seem to hear me. He kept glancing at the doorway at the front 
of the restaurant. I knew he was looking for Mom and Dad. 

“Why can’t we remember our last name?” he asked glumly. 

“I don’t know,” I confessed. “I’m very confused.” 

Every time I started to think about it, I felt dizzy. I kept telling myself I was 
just hungry. You’ll remember after you’ve had something to eat, I kept repeating. 

The waiter brought a tray of tiny sandwiches, cut into triangles. I 
recognized egg salad and tunafish. I didn’t know what the others were. 

But Eddie and I didn’t care. We started devouring the sandwiches as soon as 
the waiter set them down. 

We drank two cups of tea. Then our next tray arrived with scones and 
croissants. We loaded them up with butter and strawberry jam, and gobbled them 
down hungrily. 

“Maybe if we tell the man at the front desk what Mom and Dad look like, 
he can help us find them,” Eddie suggested. He grabbed the last croissant before 
I could get it. 

“Good idea,” I said. 

Then I let out a silent gasp. I had the dizzy feeling again. 

“Eddie,” I said, “I can’t remember what Mom and Dad look like!” 

He let the croissant fall from his hand. “I can’t either,” he murmured, 
lowering his head. “This is crazy, Sue! ” 

I shut my eyes. “Shhh. Just try to picture them,” I urged. “Force away all 
other thoughts. Concentrate. Try to picture then.” 

“I—I can’t!” Eddie stammered. I could hear the panic in his high-pitched 
voice. “Something is wrong, Sue. Something is very wrong with us.” 

I swallowed hard. I opened my eyes. I couldn’t conjure up any kind of 
picture of my parents. 

I tried thinking about Mom. Was she blond? Red-haired? Black-haired? 
Was she tall? Short? Thin? Fat? 

I couldn’t remember. 

“Where do we live?” Eddie wailed. “Do we live in a house? I can’t picture 
it, Sue. I can’t picture it at all.” 

His voice cracked. I could see he was having trouble holding back the tears. 

Panic choked my throat. I suddenly felt as if I couldn’t breathe. I stared at 
Eddie and couldn’t say a word. 

What could I say? 



My brain spun like a tornado. “We’ve lost our memory,” I finally uttered. 
“At least, part of our memory.” 

“How?” Eddie demanded in a trembling voice. “How could that happen to 
both of us?” 

I clasped my hands tightly in my lap. My hands were as cold as ice. “At 
least we still remember some things,” I said, trying not to despair completely. 

“We still remember our first names,” Eddie replied. “But not our last. And 
what else do we remember?” 

“We remember our room number,” I said. “Six twenty-six.” 

“But the desk clerk said we don’t belong in that room!” Eddie cried. 

“And we remember why we came to London,” I continued. “Because Mom 
and Dad had these important meetings.” 

“But there are no meetings at the hotel!” Eddie exclaimed. “Our memories 
are wrong, Sue. They’re all wrong!” 

I insisted on figuring out what we did remember. I had the feeling if I could 
list what we did remember, we wouldn’t feel so upset about what we had 
forgotten. 

I knew it was a crazy idea. But I didn’t know what else to do. 

“I remember the tour we took today,” I said. “I remember everywhere we 
went in London. I remember Mr. Starkes. I remember—” 

“What about yesterday?” Eddie interrupted. “What did we do yesterday, 
Sue?” 

I started to reply, but my breath caught in my throat. 

I couldn’t remember yesterday! 

Or the day before. Or the day before that. 

“Oh, Eddie,” I moaned, raising my hands to my cheeks, “something is 
terribly wrong.” 

Eddie didn’t seem to hear me. His eyes were locked on the front of the 
restaurant. 

I followed his gaze—and saw the slender, blond-haired man step into the 
room. 

The taxi driver. 

We had forgotten all about him! 



16 


I jumped up. The napkin fell off my lap, onto my shoe. I kicked it away and 
reached down to tug Eddie’s arm. “Come on—let’s get out of here.” 

Eddie gazed up at me uncertainly, then back at the taxi driver. The taxi 
driver had stopped just past the entrance. His eyes were searching each table. 

“Hurry,” I whispered. “He hasn’t seen us yet.” 

“But maybe we should just explain to him—” Eddie said. 

“Huh? Explain what?” I shot back. “That we can’t pay him because we lost 
our memory and don’t know our name? I really don’t think he’ll buy that—do 
you?” 

Eddie twisted his face in a frown. “Okay. How do we get out of here?” he 
demanded. 

The front door was blocked by the taxi driver. But I spotted a glass door on 
the back wall near our table. 

The door had a filmy, white curtain over it and a small sign that read: NO 
EXIT. 

But I didn’t care. Eddie and I had no choice. We had to leave—fast! 

I grabbed the knob and pulled the door open. Eddie and I slipped through, 
then tugged the door shut behind us. 

“I don’t think he saw us,” I whispered. “I think we’re okay.” 

We turned away from the door and found ourselves in a long, dark hallway. 
This must be an area used by the hotel workers, I thought. The floor had no 
carpet. The walls were dirty, stained, and unpainted. 

We turned a corner. I held out a hand to stop Eddie. 

We listened hard for footsteps. Had the taxi driver seen us duck out? Was he 
coming after us? 

I couldn’t hear a thing over the pounding of my heart. “What a horrible 
day!” I wailed. 

And then the day turned even more horrible. 

The man in the black cape stepped out from around the corner. “Did you 
really think I wouldn’t follow you?” he asked. “Did you really think you could 
escape from me?” 



17 


He moved forward quickly, his face hidden in the shadows. 

Eddie and I were trapped, our backs pressed against the curtained, glass 

door. 

As the caped man drew near, his features came into view. His eyes were 
dark and cold. His mouth was locked in a menacing snarl. 

He raised his palm to Eddie. “Give them back,” he demanded. 

Eddie’s eyes bulged in surprise. “Huh? Give what back?” he cried. 

The caped man kept his palm in front of Eddie’s face. “Give them back— 
now!” he bellowed. “Do not play games with me.” 

Eddie’s expression slowly changed. He glanced at me, then turned back to 
the caped man. “If I give them back, will you let us go?” 

I was totally confused. Give what back? What was Eddie talking about? 

The caped man uttered a short, dry laugh. It sounded more like a cough. 
“Do you dare to bargain with me?” he asked my brother. 

“Eddie—what is he talking about?” I cried. 

But Eddie didn’t reply. He kept his eyes locked on the shadowy face of the 
caped man. “If I give them back, will you let us go?” 

“Hand them back—now,” the big man replied sharply, leaning menacingly 
over Eddie. 

Eddie sighed. He reached into his pants pocket. And to my shock, he pulled 
out the three smooth, white stones. 

My brother the pickpocket had struck again. “Eddie—when did you take 
those?” I demanded. 

“In the sewer,” Eddie replied. “When he grabbed me.” 

“But, why?” I asked. 

Eddie shrugged. “I don’t know. They seemed important to him. So I thought 

“They are important!” the caped man bellowed. He grabbed the stones from 
Eddie’s hand. 

“Now will you let us go?” Eddie cried. 

“Yes. We will go now,” the man replied, concentrating on the stones. 



“That’s not what I said!” Eddie exclaimed. “Will you let us go?” 

The man ignored him. He piled the stones one on top of the other in his 
palm. Then he chanted some words, words in a foreign language that I didn’t 
recognize. 

As soon as he chanted the words, the hallway began to shimmer. The doors 
began to wiggle and bend, as if made of rubber. The floor buckled and swayed. 

The caped man began to shimmer and bend, too. 

The hallway throbbed with a blinding, white light. 

I felt a sharp stab of pain—as if I had been hit hard in the stomach. 

I couldn’t breathe. 

Everything went black. 



18 


Flickering orange light broke the darkness. 

I opened my eyes. Blinked several times. Took a deep breath. 

The caped man was gone. 

“Eddie—are you okay?” I asked in a quivering voice. 

“I—I think so,” he stammered. 

I gazed down the long hall, startled to find it lit by flickering candles. A 
candle was perched in a holder beside each door. 

“Sue, how did we get in this hallway?” Eddie asked softly. “Where is the 
caped man?” 

“I don’t know,” I replied. “I’m as confused as you are.” 

We stepped into the flickering light. “This has to be the old section of the 
hotel,” I guessed. “They must want it to look old-fashioned.” 

We walked past door after door. The long, narrow hallway was silent except 
for the thud of our shoes on the hardwood floor. The doors were all closed. No 
other people in sight. 

The flickering candlelight, the dark doorways, the eerie silence—all gave 
me a cold, tingly feeling. My entire body trembled. 

We kept walking through the dim, orangey light. 

“I—I want to go back to the room,” Eddie stammered as we turned another 
corner. “Maybe Mom and Dad have come back. Maybe they’re waiting for us up 
there.” 

“Maybe,” I replied doubtfully. 

We entered another silent hallway, glowing eerily in darting, dancing 
candlelight. “There’s got to be an elevator down here somewhere,” I muttered. 

But we passed only dark, closed doors. 

Turning another corner, we nearly bumped into a group of people. 

“Ohh!” I cried out, so startled to find others in these long, empty hallways. 

I stared at them as they passed. They wore long robes, and their faces were 
hidden under dark hoods. I couldn’t tell if they were men or women. 

They moved silently, making no sound at all. They paid no attention to 
Eddie or me. 



“Uh... can you tell us where the elevator is?” Eddie called after them. 

They didn’t turn back, didn’t reply. 

“Sirs?” Eddie called, chasing after them. “Please! Have you seen the 
elevator?” 

One of them turned back toward Eddie. The others continued moving 
silently down the hallway, their long robes swishing softly. 

I stepped up beside my brother and the robed figure. I could see the face 
under the hood. An old man with bushy white eyebrows. 

He peered out at Eddie, then at me. His eyes were dark and wet. His 
expression was sorrowful. 

“I smell evil around you,” he croaked in a dry whisper. 

“What?” I cried. “My brother and I—” 

“Do not leave the abbey,” the old man instructed. “I smell evil around you. 
Your time is near. So near. So very near...” 



19 


“What abbey?” I demanded. “Why are you saying that?” 

The old man didn’t reply. The candlelight glowed in his watery eyes. He 
nodded his head solemnly under the heavy hood. Then he turned away from us 
and glided silently after the others, the hem of his robe sweeping along the bare 
floor. 

“What did he mean?” Eddie demanded when the hooded man had vanished 
around a corner. “Why did he try to frighten us?” 

I shook my head. “It had to be some kind of a joke,” I replied. “They’re 
probably on their way to a party or something.” 

Eddie frowned thoughtfully. “They were creepy, Sue. They didn’t look like 
they were in a party mood to me.” 

I sighed. “Let’s find the elevator and get up to the room. I don’t like this old 
part of the hotel. It’s just too dark and scary.” 

“Hey, I’m the one who gets scared,” Eddie said, following me down the 
hall. “You’re supposed to be the brave one—remember?” 

We wandered down one long, candlelit hallway after another, feeling more 
and more lost. We couldn’t find an elevator or stairs or any kind of exit. 

“Are we going to walk forever?” Eddie whined. “There has to be a way out 
of here—doesn’t there?” 

“Let’s go back,” I suggested. “The taxi driver is probably gone by now. 
Let’s go back the way we came, and go out through the restaurant.” 

Eddie pushed his dark hair back off his forehead. “Good idea,” he muttered. 

We turned and started the long walk back. It was easy to keep in the right 
direction. We followed the hallways and made left turns instead of rights. 

We walked quickly without speaking. 

As we walked, I tried to remember our last name. Tried to remember Mom 
and Dad. Tried to picture their faces. 

Tried to remember something about them. 

Losing your memory is so terrifying. Much more frightening than being 
chased by someone. 

That’s because the problem is inside you. Inside your own mind. 

You can’t run away from it. You can’t hide from it. And you can’t solve it. 



You just feel so helpless. 

My only hope was that Mom and Dad would be waiting in the room. And 
that they could explain to Eddie and me what had happened to our memories. 
“Oh, no!” Eddie cried, startling me from my thoughts. 

We had reached the end of the final hallway. The hotel restaurant should be 
on the other side of the curtained glass door. 

But there was no door. 

No door back to the restaurant. No door at all. 

Eddie and I were staring at a solid wall. 



20 


“No!” Eddie wailed. “Let us out! Let us out of here!” He pounded furiously on 
the wall with his fist. 

I tugged him away. “This must be the wrong hallway,” I told him. “We 
made a wrong turn.” 

“No!” he protested. “It’s the right hallway! I know it is!” 

“Then where is the restaurant?” I replied. “They didn’t seal it up while we 
were walking the halls just now.” 

He stared up at me, his chin trembling, his dark eyes frightened. “Can’t we 
go outside and walk around to the front?” he asked wearily. 

“We could,” I replied thoughtfully. “If we could find a door that led to the 
outside. But so far—” 

I stopped when I heard voices. 

I turned and saw a narrow hallway leading off to our right. The voices 
seemed to be floating through this hall I hadn’t noticed before. Voices and 
laughter. 

“That must be the restaurant down there,” I told Eddie. “See? We just had 
one more turn to make. We’ll be out of here in a few seconds.” 

His face brightened a little. 

The voices and laughter grew louder as we made our way down the narrow 
corridor. Bright yellow light shone out from an open doorway at the end. 

As we stepped into the doorway, we both cried out in surprise. 

This was not the hotel restaurant we had our tea in. 

I grabbed Eddie’s arm as I stared in shock around the enormous room. Two 
blazing fireplaces provided the only light. People in strange costumes sat on low 
benches around long, wooden tables. 

A whole deer or an elk was turning on a spit, roasting over a fire in the 
center of the floor. 

The tables were piled high with food—meats, whole cabbages, green 
vegetables, fruits, whole potatoes, and foods I didn’t recognize. 

I didn’t see any plates or serving platters. The food was just strewn over the 
long tables. People reached in and pulled out what they wanted. 

They ate noisily, talking loudly, laughing and singing, taking long drinks 



from metal wine cups, slapping the cups on the tabletop and toasting each other 
merrily. 

“They’re all eating with their hands]” Eddie exclaimed. 

He was right. I didn’t see any silverware at the tables. 

Two chickens, squawking loudly, fluttered across the floor, chased by a 
large brown dog. A woman had two babies in her lap. She ignored them while 
she chewed on a large hunk of meat. 

“It’s a costume party,” I whispered to Eddie. We hadn’t the nerve to move 
from the doorway. “This must be where those guys in the hoods were going.” 

I gazed in amazement at the colorful costumes in the room. Long robes, 
loose-fitting pajama-type outfits of blue and green, leather vests worn over black 
tights. A lot of men and women wore animal furs around their shoulders— 
despite the blazing heat from the fireplaces. 

In one corner, a man appeared to be wearing an entire bearskin. He stood 
beside a giant wooden barrel, working a spigot, filling metal cups with a thick, 
brown liquid that oozed from the barrel. 

Two children in rags played tag under one of the long tables. Another child, 
dressed in green tights, chased after one of the squawking chickens. 

“What a party!” Eddie whispered. “Who are these people?” 

I shrugged. “I don’t know. I can’t understand what they’re saying too well. 
Can you?” 

Eddie shook his head. “Their accents are too weird.” 

“But maybe someone in here can tell us how to get outside,” I suggested. 

“Let’s try,” Eddie pleaded. 

I led the way into the room. Even though I was walking slowly, timidly, I 
nearly tripped over a sleeping hound dog. 

Eddie followed close behind as I made my way up to one of the men 
turning the roasting deer on the spit. He wore only knee breeches of some rough 
brown cloth. His forehead and the top of his body glistened with sweat. 

“Excuse me, sir,” I said. 

He glanced up at me and his eyes bulged wide in surprise. 

“Excuse me,” I repeated. “Can you tell us how to get out of the hotel?” 

He stared at me without replying, stared as if he had never seen a twelve- 
year-old girl in jeans and a T-shirt before. 

Two little girls, wearing gray dresses down to the floor, walked up to Eddie 
and me, staring up at us with the same shocked expression as the man. Their 



streaky blond hair fell wild and tangled behind their backs. It looked as if it had 
never been brushed in their lives! 

They pointed at us and giggled. 

And I suddenly realized that the entire room had grown silent. 

As if someone had turned a knob and clicked off the sound. 

My heart started to pound. The strong smell of the roasting deer choked my 
nostrils. 

I turned to find everyone in the room gaping in open-mouthed wonder. 
Staring in silence at Eddie and me. 

“I—I’m sorry to interrupt the party,” I stammered in a tiny, frightened 
voice. 

I let out a cry of surprise as they all climbed noisily to their feet. Food 
toppled off the table. One of the long benches clattered to the floor. 

More children pointed and giggled. 

Even the chickens seemed to stop clucking and strutting. 

And then an enormous red-faced man in a long white gown raised his hand 
and pointed at Eddie and me. “It’s THEM!” he bellowed. “It’s THEM!” 



21 


“Do they know us?” Eddie whispered to me. 

We stared back at them. Everyone seemed to freeze in place. The man 
stopped turning the deer on the spit. The only sound in the huge dining hall was 
the crackle of the fires in the twin fireplaces. 

The man in the white gown slowly lowered his hand. His face darkened to a 
bright scarlet as he gaped at us in amazement. 

“We just want to find the way out,” I said. My voice sounded tiny and 
shrill. 

No one moved. No one replied. 

I took a deep breath and tried one more time. “Can anyone help us?” 

Silence. 

Who are these strange people? I wondered. Why are they staring at us like 
that? Why won’t they answer us ? 

Eddie and I took a step back as they began to move toward us. Some of 
them were whispering excitedly, muttering to each other, gesturing with their 
hands. 

“Eddie—we’d better get out of here!” I whispered. 

I couldn’t hear what they were saying. But I didn’t like the excited 
expressions on their faces. 

And I didn’t like the way they were moving along the wall, moving to get 
behind us, to surround us. 

“Eddie—run!” I screamed. 

Angry cries rang out as we both spun around and hurtled toward the open 
doorway. Dogs barked. Children started to cry. 

We darted back into the dark hallway and kept running. 

I could still feel the heat of the fire on my face as we ran, still smell the 
tangy aroma of the roasting deer. 

Their excited, angry cries followed us through the long hall. Gasping for 
breath, I glanced back, expecting to see them chasing after us. 

But the hall was empty. 

We turned a corner and kept going. Candles flickered on both sides of us. 
The floorboards groaned under our shoes. 



The eerie, dim light. The voices far behind us. The endless tunnel of a 
hallway. All made me feel as if I were running through a dream. 

We turned another corner and kept running. 

The misty candlelight blurred as I ran. I’m floating through a dark orange 
cloud, I thought. 

Do these empty, candlelit halls ever end? 

Eddie and I both cried out happily as a door appeared in front of us. 

A door we had never seen before. 

It has to lead to the outside! I told myself. 

We raced to the door. We didn’t slow down as we reached it. 

I stuck out both hands. Pushed hard. 

The door flew open. 

And we stepped out into bright sunlight. 

Outside! We had escaped from the dark maze of the hotel corridors! 

It took a few seconds for the harsh white glare to fade from my eyes. 

I blinked several times. Then I gazed up and down the street. 

“Oh, no!” I wailed, grabbing my brother’s arm. “No! Eddie—what has 
happened ?” 



22 


“It—it’s daytime!” Eddie stammered. 

But the bright sunlight wasn’t the only shock. 

Everything had changed. 

I felt as if I were watching a movie, and the scene had changed. And 
suddenly it was the next day—or the next week—and I was seeing an entirely 
different place. 

I knew that only a few seconds had passed since Eddie and I had burst out 
of the hotel. But in that time, everything had changed. 

We huddled close together and stared in one direction and then the next. We 
saw no cars. No buses. The street had vanished, replaced by a lumpy dirt road. 

The tall buildings had disappeared, too. The road was dotted with small, 
white cottages with flat roofs and low, wooden shacks built without doors or 
windows. 

A tall mound of straw stood beside the nearest cottage. Chickens clucked 
and strutted across the road or stood in front of cottages pecking in the dirt. A 
brown cow poked its head out from behind the mound of straw. 

“What’s going on?” Eddie asked. “Where are we?” 

“It’s like we stepped back in time,” I said in a hushed voice. “Eddie—look 
at the people.” 

Two men walked by carrying lines of slender, silvery fish. The men had 
thick beards and wild, unbrushed hair. They wore loose-fitting gray smocks that 
dragged along the ground. 

Two women in long, brown dresses were on their knees, pulling up root- 
type vegetables with their hands. A man leading a scrawny horse, its bones 
sticking out at its rib cage, stopped to say something to the two women. 

“They look a lot like the people in the hotel,” I told Eddie. 

Thinking about the hotel made me turn around. “Oh, no!” I grabbed Eddie 
and made him turn around. 

The hotel was gone. 

In its place stood a long, low building built of brown stone. It appeared to 
be some sort of inn or meeting hall. 

“I don’t understand this,” Eddie moaned. In the bright sunlight, he looked 



very pale. He scratched his dark brown hair. “Sue, we’ve got to get back to the 
hotel. I—I’m very mixed up.” 

“Me, too,” I confessed. 

I took a few steps along the dirt road. It must have rained recently. The road 
was soft and muddy. 

I could hear cows mooing nearby. 

This is downtown London! I told myself. How can I hear cows in 
downtown London? Where are all the tall buildings? The cars and taxis and 
double-decker buses? 

I heard someone whistling. A blond-haired boy, dressed in an outfit made of 
black and brown rags, appeared from behind the long building. He carried a 
bundle of sticks in his arms. 

He seemed about my age. My shoes sank into the mud as I hurried across 
the road to him. “Hey—!” I called. “Hi!” 

He peered over the bundle of sticks at me. His blue eyes widened in 
surprise. His hair was long and unbrushed. It fluttered over his shoulders in the 
breeze. “Good day to you, miss,” he said. His accent was so strange, I could 
barely understand him. 

“Good day,” I replied uncertainly. 

“Are ye a traveler?” the boy asked, shifting the bundle onto his shoulder. 

“Yes,” I replied. “But my brother and I are lost. We can’t find our hotel.” 

He narrowed his blue eyes at me. He appeared to be thinking hard. 

“Our hotel,” I repeated. “Can you tell us where it is? The Barclay?” 

“Barclay?” he repeated the word. “Hotel?” 

“Yes,” I said. I waited for him to reply. But he just stared back at me, 
squinting his blue eyes and frowning. 

“I do not know those foreign words,” he said finally. 

“Hotel?” I cried impatiently. “You know. A place where travelers stay?” 

“Many stay at the abbey,” he replied. He pointed to the long, low building 
behind us. 

“No. I mean—” I started. I could see that he didn’t understand me at all. 

“I must be getting the wood along home,” the boy said. He nodded good¬ 
bye, lowered the bundle from his shoulder, and headed down the road. 

“Eddie, that boy—” I said. “He doesn’t know what a hotel is! Do you 
believe—?” 


I turned back. “Eddie?” 



Eddie was gone. 



23 


“Eddie? Eddie?” 

My voice grew higher and more frightened as I called his name. 

Where did he go? 

“Hey—Eddie!” I shouted. 

The two women glanced up from their vegetable picking. 

“Did you see where my brother went?” I called to them. 

They shook their heads and returned to their work. 

“Oh!” I had to jump out of the road as a cart, pulled by a groaning, grunting 
ox, came barreling past. The driver, a fat, bare-chested man, his pouchy skin 
darkened by the sun, slapped the ropes that served as reins. He bellowed at the 
ox to move faster. 

As the wagon rolled past, its wooden wheels sank into the mud, leaving 
deep ridges in the road. 

Chickens clucked and scurried out of the way. The two women didn’t even 
glance up. 

I made my way to the entrance of the abbey. “Eddie? Are you back here?” 

I pulled open the door and peered inside. The long candlelit hall stretched 
before me. I could see men in hooded robes gathered at a doorway. 

We just came from there, I told myself as I closed the door. Eddie wouldn’t 
go back inside. 

So where was he? 

How could he run off and leave me here? How could he just disappear like 

that? 

I called his name a few more times. Then my throat tightened up. My 
mouth felt dry as cotton. “Eddie?” I called weakly. 

My legs began to tremble as I walked to the side of the first cottage. Don’t 
panic, Sue, I told myself. You’ll find him. Just don’t panic. 

Too late. 

I was really scared. 

Eddie wouldn’t suddenly wander off and go exploring without me. He was 
too scared. 



So where was he? 

I peered into the open doorway of the cottage. A sour smell floated out from 
inside. I could see a crude wooden table and a couple of wooden stools. No one 
in there. 

I made my way behind the cottage. A grassy pasture stretched up a gently 
sloping hill. Four or five cows stood halfway up the hill, their heads lowered as 
they chewed the grass. 

I cupped my hands around my mouth and called to my brother. 

My only reply was the soft mooing of a cow. 

With a worried sigh, I turned around and made my way back to the road. I 
guess I’ll have to search every cottage, I decided. Eddie couldn’t have gone very 
far. 

I had only taken a few steps toward the next cottage when a shadow slid 
over the road. 

Startled, I raised my eyes—and stared at the dark figure blocking my path. 

His black cape fluttered behind him in the wind. He wore a new black hat, 
and his pale, pale face poked out from its dark brim. 



24 


I stepped back, out of his shadow. I raised my hands to my cheeks and stared at 
him in horrified silence. 

“I said it was time for us to go,” he said softly, moving closer. 

“Wh-where is Eddie?” I managed to choke out. “Do you know where Eddie 

is?” 

A thin-lipped smile crossed his pale face. “Eddie?” He snickered. For some 
reason, my question seemed to amuse him. “Do not worry about Eddie,” he 
replied with a sneer. 

He took another step forward. His shadow fell over me again. 

It made me shiver. 

Glancing around, I saw that the two women picking vegetables had 
disappeared into their cottages. Everyone had disappeared. The road stood empty 
except for some chickens and a hound dog, asleep on its side in front of the 
straw pile. 

“I—I don’t understand,” I stammered. “Who are you? Why are you chasing 
us? Where are we?” 

My frantic questions only made him chuckle. “You know me,” he replied 
softly. 

“No!” I protested. “I don’t know you! What is happening?” 

“Your questions cannot delay your fate,” he replied. 

I stared hard at him, trying to study his face, searching for answers. But he 
lowered the brim of the black hat, hiding his eyes from view. 

“You’ve made a mistake!” I cried. “You’ve got the wrong girl! I don’t know 
you! I don’t know anything!” 

His smile faded. He shook his head. “Come with me now,” he said firmly. 

“No!” I shrieked. “Not until you tell me who you are! Not until you tell me 
where my brother is.” 

Brushing his heavy cape back, he took another step toward me. His boots 
sank heavily into the mud as he strode forward. 

“I won’t come with you!” I screamed. My hands were still pressed hard 
against my cheeks. My legs were shaking so much, I nearly sank to the ground. 

I glanced around, getting ready to run. 



Would my trembling legs carry me? 

“Do not think of running away,” he said, as if reading my mind. 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

“You will come with me now. It is time,” he said. 

He strode forward quickly, raised his gloved hands, and grabbed me by both 
shoulders. 

I had no time to struggle. No time to try to break free. 

The ground started to rumble. 

I heard a groaning sound. A heavy slapping sound. 

Another oxcart bounced around the corner. I saw the driver slap the ox with 
a long rope. 

The cart moved so fast. A blur of groaning animal and grinding wheels. 

The black-caped man released his grasp and leaped back as the cart rolled 
at us. 

I saw his black hat fly off. Saw him stumble in the deep rut in the mud at 
the side of the road. Saw him stagger back off-balance. 

It was all the time I needed. I wheeled around and started to run. I bent low 
as I ran, hiding beside the grunting, straining ox. Then I turned sharply and dived 
between two small cottages. 

I caught a glimpse of the black-caped man as I darted past the cottages. He 
was bending to pick up his hat. His bald head shone like an egg in the sunlight. 
He had no hair at all. 

I was panting rapidly. My chest ached, and the blood throbbed at my 
temples. 

Keeping low, I ran along the backs of the cottages. The green pasture 
stretched to my left. Nowhere to hide there. 

The cottages grew closer together. I heard crying children. A woman was 
roasting some kind of blood-red sausage over a fire. She called out to me as I ran 
past. But I didn’t slow down to reply. 

Two scrawny black hounds came yapping after me, snapping at my legs. 
“Shoo!” I cried. “Shoo! Go home!” 

Glancing back, I could see the tall, dark figure gliding easily over the grass, 
his cape sweeping up behind him. 

He’s catching up, I realized. 

I have to find a hiding place, I told myself. Now! 

I ducked between two small shacks—and nearly ran into a large, red-haired 



woman carrying a baby. The baby was swaddled in a heavy, gray blanket. 
Startled, the woman squeezed the baby to her chest. 

“You’ve got to hide me!” I cried breathlessly. 

“Go away from here!” the woman replied. She seemed more frightened 
than unfriendly. 

“Please!” I begged. “He’s chasing me!” I pointed through the space 
between the cottages. 

We could both see the black-caped man running closer. 

“Please! Don’t let him catch me!” I pleaded. “Hide me! Hide me!” 

The woman had her eyes on the black-caped man. She turned to me and 
shrugged her broad shoulders. “I cannot,” she said. 



25 


I let out a long sigh, a sigh of defeat. I knew I couldn’t run any further. 

I knew the caped man would capture me easily. 

The woman pressed the baby against the front of her black dress and turned 
to watch the man run toward us. 

“I—I’ll pay you!” I blurted out. 

I suddenly remembered the coins in my pocket. The coins the taxi driver 
refused to take. 

Would the woman take them now? 

I shoved my hand into my pocket and pulled out the coins. “Here!” I cried. 
“Take them! Take them all! Just hide me—please!” 

I jammed the coins into the woman’s free hand. 

As she raised her hand to examine them, her eyes bulged and her mouth 
dropped open. 

She isn’t going to take them, either, I thought. She’s going to throw them 
back at me as the taxi driver did. 

But I was wrong. 

“Gold sovereigns!” she exclaimed in a hushed voice. “Gold sovereigns. I 
saw one once when I was a little lass.” 

“Will you take them? Will you hide me?” I pleaded. 

She dropped the coins into her dress. Then she shoved me through the open 
doorway of her little cottage. 

It smelled of fish inside. I saw three cots on the floor beside a bare hearth. 

“Quick—into the kindling basket,” the woman instructed. “It’s empty.” She 
pushed me again, toward a large straw box with a lid. 

My heart pounding, I pushed up the lid and scrambled inside. The lid 
dropped back down, covering me in darkness. 

On my hands and knees, I crouched on the rough straw bottom of the box. I 
struggled to stop panting, to stop my heart from thudding in my chest. 

The woman had taken the coins gladly, I realized. She didn’t think they 
were play money, as the taxi driver had said. 

The coins are very old, I decided. 



And then a chill ran down my trembling body. I suddenly knew why 
everything looked so different—so old. We really have gone back in time, I told 
myself. 

We are back in London hundreds of years ago. 

The caped man brought us back here with those white stones. He thinks I 
am someone else. He has been chasing me because he has mistaken me for 
someone else. 

How do I make him see the truth? I wondered. 

And how do I get out of the past, back to my real time? 

I forced the questions from my mind—and listened. 

I could hear voices outside the cottage. The woman’s voice. And then the 
booming, deep voice of the black-caped man. 

I held my breath so I could hear their words over the loud beating of my 
heart. 

“She is right in here, sire,” the woman said. I heard footsteps. And then 
their voices became louder. Closer. They were standing beside my basket. 

“Where is she?” the caped man demanded. 

“I put her in this box for you, sire,” the woman replied. “She’s all wrapped 
up for you. Ready for you to take her away.” 



26 


My heart jumped to my throat. In the blackness of the box, I suddenly saw red. 

That woman took my money, I thought angrily. And then she gave away my 
hiding place. 

How could she do that to me? 

I was still crouched on my hands and knees. So angry. So terrified. My 
entire body went numb, and I felt as if I would crumple to the basket floor in a 
heap. 

Taking a deep breath, I twisted around and tried to push open the straw lid. 

I let out a disappointed groan when it didn’t budge. 

Was it clasped shut? Or was the caped man holding it down? 

It didn’t matter. I was helpless. Trapped. I was his prisoner now. 

The basket suddenly moved, knocking me against its side. I could feel it 
sliding over the floor of the cottage. 

“Hey—!” I cried out. But my voice was muffled in the tiny box. I lowered 
myself to the rough straw floor, my heart pounding. “Let me out!” 

The basket bounced again. Then I felt it slide some more. 

“Lass! You—lass!” I lifted my head as I heard the woman whispering in to 
me. 

“I am so sorry,” she said. “I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive 
me. But I dare not go against the Lord High Executioner.” 

“What?” I cried. “What did you say?” 

The basket slid faster. Bumped hard. Bumped again. 

“What did you say?” I repeated frantically. 

Silence now. 

I did not hear her voice again. 

A moment later, I heard the whinny of horses. I was tossed against one side, 
then the other, as the basket was lifted up. 

Soon after, the basket began to bounce and shake. And I heard the steady 
clip-clop of horses’ hooves. 

A helpless prisoner inside the straw basket, I knew I was on some kind of 
carriage or horse cart. 



The Lord High Executioner? 

Is that what the woman had said? 

The shadowy man in the black cape and black hat—he is the Lord High 
Executioner? 

Inside my tiny, dark prison, I began to shudder. I could not stop the chills 
that rolled down my back until my entire body felt cold and numb and tingly. 

The Lord High Executioner. 

The words kept repeating and repeating in my mind. Like a terrifying chant. 
The Lord High Executioner. 

And then I asked myself: What does he want with me? 



27 


The wagon stopped with a jolt. Then, a minute or so later, started up again. 

Bouncing around inside the basket, I lost all track of time. 

Where is he taking me? I wondered. What does he plan to do? 

And: Why me? 

My head hit the front of the basket as we jolted to another stop. I shivered. 
My body was drenched in a cold sweat. 

The air in the box had become sour. I began gasping for fresh air. 

I let out a cry as the lid suddenly flew open. The harsh sunlight made me 
shield my eyes. 

“Remove her!” I heard the booming voice of the Executioner. 

Strong arms grabbed me roughly and tugged me from the straw box. As my 
eyes adjusted to the light, I saw that I was being lifted by two gray-uniformed 
soldiers. 

They set me on my feet. But my legs gave way, and I crumpled to the dirt. 

“Stand her up,” the Executioner ordered. I gazed up into the sun at him. His 
face was hidden once again in the shadow of his dark hat. 

The soldiers bent to pick me up. Both of my legs had fallen asleep. My 
back ached from being tossed and tumbled in the cramped box. 

“Let me go!” I managed to cry. “Why are you doing this?” 

The Executioner didn’t reply. 

The soldiers held on to me until I could stand on my own. 

“You’ve made a terrible mistake!” I told him, my voice trembling with 
anger, with fear. “I don’t know why I am here or how I got here! But I am the 
wrong girl! I am not who you think I am!” 

Again, he did not reply. He gave a signal with one hand, and the guards 
took my arms and turned me around. 

And as I turned away from the Executioner, away from the sun, the dark 
castle rose in front of me. I saw the wall, the courtyard, the dark, slender towers 
looming up over the stone castle. 

The Terror Tower! 

He had brought me to the Terror Tower. 



This is where Eddie and I had seen him for the first time. This is where the 
Executioner had first chased after us. 

In the twentieth century. In my time. In the time where I belonged. 
Hundreds of years in the future. 

Somehow Eddie and I had been dragged back into the past, to a time where 
we didn’t belong. And now Eddie was lost. And I was being led to the Terror 
Tower. 

The Executioner led the way. The soldiers gripped my arms firmly, pulling 
me through the courtyard toward the castle entrance. 

The courtyard was jammed with silent, grim-looking people. Dressed in 
rags and tattered, stained gowns, they stared at me as I was dragged past. 

Some of them stood hunched like scarecrows, their eyes vacant, their faces 
blank, as if their minds were somewhere else. Some sat and wept, or stared at the 
sky. 

A bare-chested old man sat under a tree frantically scratching his greasy 
tangles of white hair with both hands. A young man pressed a filthy rag against a 
deep cut in his dirt-caked foot. 

Babies cried and wailed. Men and women sat in the dirt, moaning and 
muttering to themselves. 

These sad, filthy people were all prisoners, I realized. I remembered our 
tour guide, Mr. Starkes, telling us that the castle had first been a fort, then a 
prison. 

I shook my head sadly, wishing I were back on the tour. In the future, in the 
time where I belonged. 

I didn’t have long to think about the prisoners. I was shoved into the 
darkness of the castle. Dragged up the twisting stone steps. 

The air felt wet and cold as I climbed. A heavy chill seemed to rise up the 
stairs with me. 

“Let me go!” I screamed. “Please—let me go!” 

The soldiers shoved me against the stone wall when I tried to pull free. 

I cried out helplessly and tried again to tug myself loose. But they were too 
big, too strong. 

The stone stairs curved round and around. We passed the cell on the narrow 
landing. Glancing toward it, I saw that it was jammed with prisoners. They stood 
in silence against the bars, their faces yellow and expressionless. Many of them 
didn’t even look up as I passed. 



Up the steep, slippery stairs. 

Up to the dark door at the top of the tower. 

“No—please!” I begged. “This is all wrong! All wrong!” 

But they slid the heavy metal bolt on the door and pulled the door open. 

A hard shove from behind sent me sprawling into the tiny tower room. I 
stumbled to the floor, landing on my elbows and knees. 

I heard the heavy door slam behind me. Then I heard the bolt sliding back 
into place. 

Locked in. 

I was locked in the tiny cell at the top of the Terror Tower. 

“Sue!” A familiar voice called my name. 

I raised myself to my knees. Glanced up. “Eddie!” I cried happily. “Eddie— 
how did you get here?” 

My little brother had been sitting on the floor against the wall. Now he 
scrambled over to me and helped me to my feet. “Are you okay?” he asked. 

I nodded. “Are you okay?” 

“I guess,” he replied. He had a long dirt smear down one side of his face. 
His dark hair was matted wetly against his forehead. His eyes were red-rimmed 
and frightened. 

“The caped man grabbed me,” Eddie said. “Back in the town. In the street. 
You know. When that oxcart came by.” 

I nodded. “I turned around, and you were gone.” 

“I tried to call to you,” Eddie replied. “But the caped man covered my 
mouth. He handed me to his soldiers. And they pulled me behind one of the 
cottages.” 

“This is so awful!” I cried, struggling to hold my tears back. 

“One of the soldiers lifted me onto his horse,” Eddie said. “I tried to squirm 
away. But I couldn’t. He brought me to the castle and dragged me up to the 
Tower.” 

“The caped man—he’s the Lord High Executioner,” I told my brother. 
“That’s what I heard a woman call him.” 

The words made my brother gasp. His dark eyes locked onto mine. 
“Executioner?” 

I nodded grimly. 

“But why does he want us?” Eddie demanded. “Why has he been chasing 
us? Why are we locked up in this horrible tower?” 



A sob escaped my throat. “I—I don’t know,” I stammered. 

I started to say something else—but stopped when I heard noises outside 
the door. 

Eddie and I huddled together in the center of the room. 

I heard the bolt slide open. 

The door slowly began to open. 

Someone was coming for us. 



28 


A white-haired man stepped into the room. His hair was wild and long, and fell 
in thick tangles behind his shoulders. He had a short white beard that ended in a 
sharp point. 

He wore a purple robe that flowed down to the floor. His eyes were as 
purple as his robe. They squinted first at Eddie, then lingered on me. 

“You have returned,” he said solemnly. His voice was smooth and low. His 
purple eyes suddenly revealed sadness. 

“Who are you?” I cried. “Why have you locked us in this tower?” 

“Let us out!” Eddie demanded shrilly. “Let us out of here—right now!” 

The long purple robe swept over the floor as the white-haired man moved 
toward us. He shook his head sadly, but didn’t reply. 

The cries and moans of prisoners down below floated into the tower room 
through the tiny window above our heads. Gray evening light spilled over us. 

“You do not remember me,” the man said softly. 

“Of course not!” Eddie cried. “We don’t belong here!” 

“You’ve made a bad mistake,” I told him. 

“You do not remember me,” he repeated, rubbing his pointed beard with 
one hand. “But you will.” 

He seemed gentle. Kind. Not at all like the Executioner. 

But as his strange purple eyes locked on mine, I felt a shiver of fear. This 
man was powerful, I realized. This man was dangerous. 

“Just let us go!” Eddie pleaded again. 

The man sighed. “I wish it were in my power to release you, Edward,” he 
said softly. “I wish it were in my power to release you, too, Susannah.” 

“Wait a minute.” I held up a hand to signal stop. “Just wait a minute. My 
name is Sue. Not Susannah.” 

The old man’s hands disappeared into the deep pockets of his robe. 
“Perhaps I should introduce myself,” he said. “My name is Morgred. I am the 
king’s sorcerer.” 

“You do magic tricks?” Eddie blurted out. 

“Tricks?” The old man seemed confused by Eddie’s question. 

“Did you order us locked up in here?” I asked him. “Did you have us 



brought back in time? Why? Why have you done this?” 

“It isn’t an easy story to tell, Susannah,” Morgred replied. “You and Edward 
have to believe—” 

“Stop calling me Susannah!” I shouted. 

“I’m not Edward!” my brother insisted. “I’m Eddie. Everyone calls me 
Eddie.” 

The old man removed his hands from his robe pockets. He placed one hand 
on Eddie’s shoulder, and one on mine. 

“I had better start with the biggest surprise of all,” he told us. “You are not 
Eddie and Sue. And you do not live in the twentieth century.” 

“Huh? What are you saying ?” I cried. 

“You really are Edward and Susannah,” Morgred replied. “You are the 
Prince and Princess of York. And you have been ordered to the Tower by your 
uncle, the king.” 



29 


“You’re wrong!” Eddie cried. “We know who we are. You’ve made a big 
mistake!” 

I suddenly felt cold all over. Morgred’s words echoed in my ears. “You are 
not Eddie and Sue. You really are Edward and Susannah.” 

I took a step back, out from under his hand. I studied his face. Was he 
joking? Was he crazy? 

His eyes revealed only sadness. His expression remained solemn, too 
solemn to be joking. 

“I do not expect you to believe me,” Morgred said, returning his hands to 
his robe pockets. “But my words are true. I cast a spell upon you. I tried to help 
you escape.” 

“Escape?” I cried. “You mean—escape from this tower?” 

Morgred nodded. “I tried to help you escape your fate.” 

And as he said this, the voice of Mr. Starkes, the tour guide, returned to my 
ears. And I remembered the story he had told. I remembered the fate of Prince 
Edward and Princess Susannah. 

The king’s orders were to smother them. 

Smothered with pillows. 

“But we’re not them!” I wailed. “You’re just confused. Maybe Eddie and I 
look like them. Maybe we look a lot like them. But we’re not the prince and 
princess. We’re two kids from the twentieth century.” 

Morgred shook his head solemnly. “I cast a spell,” he explained. “I erased 
your memories. You were locked in this tower. I wanted you to escape. First I 
whisked you away to the safety of the abbey, then I sent you as far into the future 
as I could.” 

“It’s not true!” Eddie insisted, shrieking the words. “It’s not true! Not true! 
I’m Eddie—not Edward. My name is Eddie!” 

Morgred sighed again. “Just Eddie?” he asked, keeping his voice low and 
soft. “What is your full name, Eddie?” 

“I—uh—well...” my brother stammered. 

Eddie and I don’t know our last name, I realized. And we don’t know where 
we live. 



“When I sent you far into the future, I gave you new memories,” Morgred 
said. “I gave you new memories so you could survive in a new and distant time. 
But the memories were not complete.” 

“That’s why we couldn’t remember our parents!” I exclaimed to Eddie. 

“But our parents—?” I started. 

“Your parents, the rightful king and queen, are dead,” Morgred told us. 
“Your uncle has named himself king. And he has ordered you to the Tower to get 
you out of the way.” 

“He—he’s going to have us murdered !” I stammered. 

Morgred nodded, shutting his eyes. “Yes. I am afraid he is. His men will be 
here soon. There is no way I can stop him now.” 



30 


“I don’t believe this,” Eddie murmured. “I really don’t.” 

But I could see the sadness in Morgred’s purple eyes and hear it in his low, 
soft voice. The sorcerer was telling the truth. 

The horror of the truth was sinking in. My brother and I weren’t Eddie and 
Sue from the twentieth century. We lived in this dark and dangerous time. We 
were Edward and Susannah of York. 

“I tried to send you as far from this Tower as possible,” Morgred tried to 
explain again. “I sent you far into the future to start new lives. I wanted you to 
live there and never return. Never return to face doom in this castle.” 

“But what happened?” I demanded. “Why, then, are we back here, 
Morgred?” 

“The Lord High Executioner was spying on me,” Morgred explained, 
lowering his voice to a whisper. “He must have known that I wanted to help you 
escape. And, so—” 

He stopped and tilted his head toward the door. 

Was that a footstep? Was someone out there? 

All three of us listened. 

Silence now. 

Morgred continued his story in a whisper. “When I cast the spell that sent 
you into the future, the Executioner must have hidden nearby. I used three white 
stones to cast the spell. Later, he stole the stones and performed the spell 
himself. He sent himself to the future to bring you back. And as you both know, 
he caught you and dragged you back here.” 

Morgred took a step forward. He raised his hand and placed it on my 
forehead. 

The hand felt cold at first. Then it grew warmer and warmer, until I pulled 
away from the blazing heat. 

As I pulled back, my memory returned. 

Once again, I became Princess Susannah of York. My true identity. I 
remembered my parents, the king and queen. And all my memories of growing 
up in the royal castle returned. 

My brother glared angrily at Morgred. “What did you do to my sister?” he 



cried, backing up until he bumped into the stone wall. 

Morgred placed his hand on my brother’s forehead. And I watched my 
brother’s expression change as his memory returned and he realized he really 
was the prince. 

“How did you do it, Morgred?” Edward asked, pushing his dark brown hair 
off his forehead. “How did you send Susannah and me to the future? Can you 
perform the spell again?” 

“Yes!” I cried. “Can you perform it once more? Can you send us to the 
future now—before the king’s men come?” 

Morgred shook his head sadly. “Alas, I cannot,” he murmured. “I do not 
have the three stones. As I told you, they were stolen by the Lord High 
Executioner.” 

A smile slowly spread over my brother’s face. He reached into his pocket. 
“Here they are!” Eddie announced. He winked at me. “I stole them back again 
when the Executioner captured me in town.” 

Edward handed the stones to Morgred. “Fastest hands in all of Britannia!” 
he declared. 

Morgred did not smile. “It is a simple spell, actually,” the wizard said. He 
raised the three stones into the air, and they began to glow. 

“I pile the stones up one on top of the other,” Morgred explained. “I wait 
for them to glow with a bright white heat. Then I pronounce the words 
‘Movarum, Lovaris, Movarus. ’ I then call out the year to which the traveler is to 
be sent.” 

“That’s the whole spell?” Edward asked, staring at the smooth, glowing 
stones in Morgred’s hand. 

Morgred nodded. “That is the spell, Prince Edward.” 

“Well, do it again! Please hurry!” I begged him. 

His expression grew even sadder. “I cannot,” he said, his voice breaking 
with emotion. 

He returned the three stones to the pocket of his robe. Then he uttered a 
long, unhappy sigh. “It is my fondest wish to help you children,” he whispered. 
“But if I help you to escape again, the king will torture me and put me to a 
painful death. And then I will not be able to use my magic to help all the people 
of Britain.” 

Tears brimmed in his purple eyes and ran down his wrinkled cheeks. He 
gazed unhappily at my brother and me. “I—I only hope that you enjoyed your 



brief time in the future,” he said in a whisper. 

I shuddered. “You—you really cannot help us?” I pleaded. 

“I cannot,” he replied, lowering his eyes to the floor. 

“Even if we ordered you?” Edward asked. 

“Even if you ordered me,” Morgred repeated. With an emotional cry, he 
wrapped Edward in a hug. Then he turned and hugged me, too. “I am helpless,” 
he whispered. “I beg your forgiveness. But I am helpless.” 

“How long do we have to live?” I asked in a tiny, trembling voice. 

“Perhaps a few hours,” Morgred replied, avoiding my eyes. He turned 
away. He could not bear to face us. 

A heavy silence fell over the tiny room. The gray light filtered down from 
the window above our heads. The air suddenly felt cold and damp. 

I couldn’t stop shivering. 

Edward startled me by leaning close and whispering in my ear. “Susannah, 
look!” he whispered excitedly. “The door. Morgred left the door open when he 
entered.” 

I turned to the door. Edward was right. The heavy wooden door stood 
nearly half open. 

We still have a chance, I thought, my heart beginning to race. We still have 
a tiny chance. 

“Edward—run!” I screamed. 



31 


I took a running step. 

And froze in midair. 

I turned to see Edward freeze, too, his arms outstretched, his legs bent in a 
running position. 

I struggled to move. But I couldn’t. I felt as if my body had turned to stone. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that Morgred had cast a spell on us. 
Frozen stiffly in the center of the tiny room, I watched the sorcerer make his way 
to the door. 

Halfway out, he turned back to us. “I’m so sorry,” he said in a trembling 
voice. “But I cannot allow you to escape. Please understand. I did my best. I 
really did. But now I am helpless. Truly helpless.” 

Tears rolled down his cheeks, into his white beard. He gave us one last sad 
glance. Then the door slammed hard behind him. 

As soon as the door was bolted from the outside, the spell wore off. Edward 
and I could move again. 

I sank to the floor. I suddenly felt weak. Weary. 

Edward stood tensely beside me, his eyes on the door. 

“What are we going to do?” I asked my brother. “Poor Morgred. He tried to 
help us. He wanted to help us again. But he couldn’t. If only—” 

I stopped talking when I heard the heavy footsteps outside the door. 

At first, I thought it was Morgred returning. 

But then I heard hushed voices. The sounds of more than one man. 

Right outside the door now. 

And I recognized the booming voice of one of them. The Lord High 
Executioner. 

I climbed tensely to my feet and turned to Edward. “They’ve come for us,” 
I whispered. 



32 


To my surprise, Edward’s face remained calm. 

He raised his hand. He had something hidden in his closed fist. 

As he opened his fist, I recognized the three stones. Morgred’s smooth, 
white stones. 

They immediately began to glow. 

“Edward—again?” I cried. 

A smile crossed his lips. His dark eyes lit up excitedly. “I lifted them from 
Morgred’s robe when he hugged me.” 

“Do you remember the spell?” I demanded. 

Edward’s smile faded. “I—I think so.” 

I could hear the Executioner outside the door. The heavy treading of boots 
on the stone stairs. 

“Edward—please hurry!” I urged. 

I heard the bolt slide outside the door. 

I heard the heavy wooden door begin to slide open. 

Edward struggled to stack the glowing stones one on top of the other. The 
one on top kept slipping off. 

Finally, he held all three in a small tower in his palm. 

The door slid open a few inches more. 

Edward held the glowing stones high. And called out the words, 
“Movarum, Lovaris, Movaris!” 

The glowing stones exploded in a flash of white light. 

The light faded quickly. 

I glanced around. 

“Oh, Edward!” I wailed in disappointment. “It didn’t work! We’re still in 
the Tower!” 

Before my stunned brother could reply, the door swung all the way open. 



33 


And there they stood. A tour group. 

I didn’t recognize the tour leader. She was a young woman, dressed in 
layers of red and yellow T-shirts, and a short skirt over black tights. 

I grinned at Edward. I felt so happy, I didn’t think I would ever stop 
grinning! 

“You did it, Edward!” I cried. “You did it! Your spell did work!” 

“Call me Eddie,” he replied, laughing gleefully. “Call me Eddie, okay, 
Sue?” 

The spell had worked perfectly. We were back in the twentieth century. 
Back in the Tower—as tourists! 

“This tiny Tower room is where Prince Edward and Princess Susannah of 
York were held as prisoners,” the tour guide announced. “They were held here 
and sentenced to death. But they were never executed.” 

“They didn’t die up here?” I asked the tour guide. “What happened?” 

The tour guide shrugged. She chewed her gum harder. “No one knows. On 
the night they were to be murdered, the prince and princess vanished. 
Disappeared into thin air. It is a mystery that will never be solved.” 

Members of the tour group mumbled to each other, gazing around the small 
room. 

“Look at the thick, stone walls,” the tour guide continued, chewing her gum 
as she talked. “Look at the barred window so high above. How did they escape? 
We will never know.” 

“I guess we know the answer to the mystery,” someone whispered behind 
me. 

Eddie and I turned to see Morgred grinning at us. He winked. I saw that he 
was wearing a purple sports jacket and dark gray trousers. 

“Thanks for bringing me along,” he said happily. 

“We had to bring you, Morgred,” Eddie replied. “We need a parent.” 

Morgred raised a finger to his mouth. “Hush! Don’t call me Morgred. I’m 
Mr. Morgan now. Okay?” 

“Okay,” I said. “And I guess I’m Sue Morgan. And this is Eddie Morgan.” I 
slapped my brother on the back. 



The tour group started out of the Tower room, and we followed. Eddie 
pulled the three white stones from his jeans pocket and began juggling them. 

“If I hadn’t borrowed these from your robe,” he told Mr. Morgan, “that tour 
guide would be telling a very different story—wouldn’t she!” 

“Yes, she would,” the sorcerer replied thoughtfully. “Avery different story.” 

“Let’s get out of here!” I cried. “I never want to see this tower again.” 

“I’m starving!” Eddie exclaimed. 

I suddenly realized I was starving, too. 

“Shall I perform a food spell?” Mr. Morgan suggested. 

Eddie and I each let out a loud groan. “I think I’ve had enough spells to last 
a lifetime,” I said. “How about we go to Burger Palace for some good old 
twentieth-century hamburgers and fries!” 




THE CUCKOO 
CLOCK OF DOOM 

Goosebumps - 28 
R.L. Stine 


1 


“Michael, your shoe’s untied.” 

My sister, Tara, sat on the front steps, grinning at me. Another one of 
her dumb jokes. 

I’m not an idiot. I knew better than to look down at my shoe. If I did, 
she’d slap me under the chin or something. 

“I’m not falling for that old trick,” I told her. 

Mom had just called me and the brat inside for dinner. An hour before 
she had made us go outside because she couldn’t stand our fighting 
anymore. 

It was impossible not to fight with Tara. 

When it comes to stupid tricks, Tara never knows when to quit. “I’m 
not kidding,” she insisted. “Your shoe’s untied. You’re going to trip.” 

“Knock it off, Tara,” I said. I started up the front steps. 

My left shoe seemed to cling to the cement. I pulled it up with a jerk. 

“Yuck!” I’d stepped on something sticky. 

I glanced at Tara. She’s a skinny little squirt, with a wide red mouth 
like a clown’s and stringy brown hair that she wears in two pigtails. 

Everyone says she looks exactly like me. I hate it when they say that. 
My brown hair is not stringy, for one thing. It’s short and thick. And my 
mouth is normal-sized. No one has ever said I look like a clown. 

I’m a little short for my age, but not skinny. 

I do not look like Tara. 

She was watching me, giggling. “You’d better look down,” she taunted 
in her singsong voice. 

I glanced down at my shoe. It wasn’t untied, of course. But I’d just 
stepped on a huge wad of gum. If I had looked down to check my 
shoelaces, I would have seen it. 

But Tara knew I wouldn’t look down. Not if she told me to. 

Tricked by Tara the Terror again. 

“You’re going to get it, Tara,” I grumbled. I tried to grab her, but she 
dodged out of reach and ran into the house. 



I chased her into the kitchen. She screamed and hid behind my mother. 

“Mom! Hide me! Michael’s going to get me!” she shrieked. 

As if she were afraid of me. Fat chance. 

“Michael Webster!” Mom scolded. “Stop chasing your little sister.” 

She glanced at my feet and added, “Is that gum on your shoe? Oh, 
Michael, you’re tracking it all over the floor!” 

“Tara made me step on it!” I whined. 

Mom frowned. “Do you expect me to believe that? Michael, you’re 
fibbing again.” 

“I am not!” I cried. 

Mom shook her head in disgust. “If you’re going to tell a lie, Michael, 
at least make it a good one.” 

Tara peeked out from behind Mom and taunted me. “Yeah, Michael .” 

Then she laughed. She loved this. 

She’s always getting me into trouble. My parents always blame me for 
stuff that’s her fault. But does Tara ever do anything wrong? Oh, no, never. 
She’s a perfect angel. Not a bad bone in her body. 

I’m twelve. Tara’s seven. She’s made the last seven years of my life 
miserable. 

Too bad I don’t remember the first five very well. The pre-Tara years. 
They must have been awesome! Quiet and peaceful—and fun! 

I went out to the back porch and scraped the sticky gum off my shoe. I 
heard the doorbell ring and Dad calling, “It’s here! I’ll get it.” 

Inside, everybody gathered around the front door. Two men were 
struggling to carry something heavy into the house. Something long and 
narrow and wrapped with padded gray cloth. 

“Careful,” Dad warned them. “It’s very old. Bring it in here.” 

Dad led the delivery guys into the den. They set the thing down on one 
end and began to unwrap it. It was about as wide as me and maybe a foot 
taller. 

“What is it?” Tara asked. 

Dad didn’t answer right away. He mbbed his hands together in 
anticipation. Our cat, Bubba, slinked into the room and rubbed against 
Dad’s legs. 

The gray cloth fell away, and I saw a very fancy old clock. It was 
mostly black but painted with lots of silver, gold, and blue designs, and 



decorated with scrolls, carvings, knobs, and buttons. 

The clock itself had a white face with gold hands and gold Roman 
numerals. I saw little secret doors hidden under the paint designs, and a big 
door in the middle of the clock. 

The delivery guys gathered up the gray padding. Dad gave them some 
money, and they left. 

“Isn’t it great?” Dad gushed. “It’s an antique cuckoo clock. It was a 
bargain. You know that store across from my office, Anthony’s Antiques 
and Stuff?” 

We all nodded. 

“It’s been in the shop for fifteen years,” Dad told us, patting the clock. 
“Every time I pass Anthony’s, I stop and stare at it. I’ve always loved it. 
Anthony finally put it on sale.” 

“Cool,” Tara said. 

“But you’ve been bargaining with Anthony for years, and he always 
refused to lower the price,” Mom said. “Why now?” 

Dad’s face lit up. “Well, today I went into the shop at lunchtime, and 
Anthony told me he’d discovered a tiny flaw on the clock. Something 
wrong with it.” 

I scanned the clock. “Where?” 

“He wouldn’t say. Do you see anything, kids?” 

Tara and I began to search the clock for flaws. All the numbers on the 
face were correct, and both the hands were in place. I didn’t see any chips 
or scratches. 

“I don’t see anything wrong with it,” Tara said. 

“Me, either,” I added. 

“Neither do I,” Dad agreed. “I don’t know what Anthony’s talking 
about. I told him I wanted to buy the clock anyway. He tried to talk me out 
of it, but I insisted. If the flaw is so tiny we don’t even notice it, what 
difference does it make? Anyway, I really do love this thing.” 

Mom cleared her throat. “I don’t know, dear. Do you think it really 
belongs in the den?” I could tell by her face that she didn’t like the clock as 
much as Dad did. 

“Where else could we put it?” Dad asked. 

“Well—maybe the garage?” 

Dad laughed. “I get it—you’re joking!” 



Mom shook her head. She wasn’t joking. But she didn’t say anything 
more. 

“I think this clock is just what the den needs, honey,” Dad added. 

On the right side of the clock I saw a little dial. It had a gold face and 
looked like a miniature clock. But it had only one hand. 

Tiny numbers were painted in black along the outside of the dial, 
starting at 1800 and ending at 3000. The thin gold hand pointed to one of 
the numbers: 2003. 

The hand didn’t move. Beneath the dial, a little gold button had been 
set into the wood. 

“Don’t touch that button, Michael,” Dad warned. “This dial tells the 
current year. The button moves the hand to change the year.” 

“That’s kind of silly,” Mom said. “Who ever forgets what year it is?” 

Dad ignored her. “See, the clock was built in 1800, where the dial 
starts. Every year the pointer moves one notch to show the date.” 

“So why does it stop at three thousand?” Tara asked. 

Dad shrugged. “I don’t know. I guess the clock-maker couldn’t 
imagine the year three thousand would ever come. Or maybe he figured the 
clock wouldn’t last that long.” 

“Maybe he thought the world would blow up in 2999,” I suggested. 

“Could be,” Dad said. “Anyway, please don’t touch the dial. In fact, I 
don’t want anyone touching the clock at all. It’s very old and very, very 
delicate. Okay?” 

“Okay, Dad,” Tara said. 

“I won’t touch it,” I promised. 

“Look,” Mom said, pointing at the clock. “It’s six o’clock. Dinner’s 
almost—” 

Mom was interrupted by a loud gong. A little door just over the clock 
face slid open—and a bird flew out. It had the meanest bird face I ever saw 
—and it dove for my head. 

I screamed. “It’s alive!” 



2 


Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 

The bird flapped its yellow feathers. Its eerie, bright blue eyes glared 
at me. It squawked six times. Then it jumped back inside the clock. The 
little door slid shut. 

“It’s not alive, Michael,” Dad said, laughing. “It sure is real-looking, 
though, isn’t it? Wow!” 

“You birdbrain!” Tara teased. “You were scared! Scared of a cuckoo 
clock!” She reached out and pinched me. 

“Get off me,” I growled. I shoved her away. 

“Michael, don’t push your sister,” Mom said. “You don’t realize how 
strong you are. You could hurt her.” 

“Yeah, Michael,” Tara said. 

Dad kept admiring the clock. He could hardly take his eyes off it. “I’m 
not surprised the cuckoo startled you,” he said. “There’s something special 
about this clock. It comes from the Black Forest of Germany. It’s supposed 
to be enchanted.” 

“Enchanted?” I echoed. “You mean, magic? How?” 

“Legend has it that the man who built this clock had magical powers. 
He put a spell on the clock. They say if you know the secret, you can use 
the clock to go back in time.” 

Mom scoffed. “Did Anthony tell you that? What a great way to sell an 
old clock. Claim it has magic powers!” 

Dad wouldn’t let her spoil his fun. “You never know,” he said. “It 
could be true. Why not?” 

“I think it’s true,” Tara said. 

“Herman, I wish you wouldn’t tell the kids these wild stories,” Mom 
chided. “It’s not good for them. And it only encourages Michael. He’s 
always making things up, telling fibs and impossible stories. I think he gets 
it from you.” 

I protested. “I don’t make things up! I always tell the truth!” 

How could Mom say that about me? 

“I don’t think it hurts the kids to use their imaginations once in a 



while,” Dad said. 

“Imagination is one thing,” Mom said. “Lies and fibs are something 
else.” 

I fumed. Mom was so unfair to me. The worst part was the expression 
of victory on Tara’s face. 

Making me look bad was her mission in life. I wanted to wipe that 
smirk off her face forever. 

“Dinner’s almost ready,” Mom announced, leaving the den. The cat 
followed her. “Michael, Tara—go wash up.” 

“And remember,” Dad warned. “No one touches the clock.” 

“Okay, Dad,” I said. 

Dinner smelled good. I started for the bathroom to wash up. As I 
passed Tara, she stomped hard on my foot. 

“Ow!” I yelled. 

“Michael!” Dad barked. “Stop making so much noise.” 

“But, Dad, Tara stomped on my foot.” 

“It couldn’t have hurt that much, Michael. She’s a lot smaller than you 

are.” 

My foot throbbed. I limped to the bathroom. Tara followed me. 

“You’re such a baby,” she taunted. 

“Be quiet, Tara,” I said. How did I get the worst sister in the world? 

We had pasta with broccoli and tomato sauce for dinner. Mom was on 
a big no-meat, low-fat kick. I didn’t mind. Pasta was better than what we’d 
had the night before—lentil soup. 

“You know, honey,” Dad complained to Mom, “a hamburger now and 
then never hurt anybody.” 

“I disagree,” Mom said. She didn’t have to say more. We’d all heard 
her lectures about meat and fat and chemicals before. 

Dad covered his pasta with a thick layer of Parmesan cheese. 

“Maybe the den should be off-limits for a while,” Dad suggested. “I 
hate to think of you two playing in there and breaking the clock.” 

“But, Dad, I have to do my homework in the den tonight,” I said. “I’m 
doing a report on Transportation in Many Lands.’ And I need to use the 
encyclopedia.” 

“Can’t you take it up to your room?” Dad asked. 

“The whole encyclopedia?” 



Dad sighed. “No, I guess you can’t. Well, all right. You can use the den 
tonight.” 

“I need to use the encyclopedia, too,” Tara announced. 

“You do not,” I snapped. She wanted to hang around the den and bug 
me, that was all. 

“I do, too. I’m supposed to read about the gold rush.” 

“You’re making that up. You don’t study the gold rush in the second 
grade. That’s not until fourth.” 

“What do you know about it? Mrs. Dolin is teaching us the gold rush 
now. Maybe I’m in a smarter class than you were.” 

Mom said, “Michael, really. If Tara says she needs to use the 
encyclopedia, why start a fight about it?” 

I sighed and stuffed a forkful of pasta in my mouth. Tara stuck her 
tongue out at me. 

There’s no point in talking, I thought. All it does is get me into trouble. 

I lugged my backpack into the den after dinner. No sign of Tara—yet. 
Maybe I’d be able to get some homework done before she came in and 
started pestering me. 

I dumped my books on Dad’s desk. The clock caught my eye. It wasn’t 
pretty—kind of ugly, really. But I liked looking at all those scrolls and 
buttons and knobs. It really did seem as if the clock could be magic. 

I thought about the flaw Dad had mentioned. I wondered what it was. 
Some kind of bump? A missing notch on one of the gears? Maybe a piece 
of chipped paint? 

I glanced back at the door to the den. Bubba wandered through it, 
purring. I petted him. 

Mom and Dad were still in the kitchen, cleaning up after dinner. I 
didn’t think it would matter if I just looked at the clock a little. 

Careful not to touch any buttons, I stared at the dial that showed the 
year. I ran my fingers along a curve of silver at the edge of the clock. I 
glanced at the little door over the face of the clock. I knew the cuckoo sat 
behind that door, waiting to leap out at the right time. 

I didn’t want to be surprised by the bird again. I checked the time. Five 
minutes to eight. 

Under the face of the clock I saw another door. A big door. I touched 



its gold knob. 

What’s behind this door? I wondered. Maybe the gears of the clock, or 
a pendulum. 

I glanced over my shoulder again. No one was looking. No problem if 
I just peeked behind that big clock door. 

I tugged on the gold knob. The door stuck. I pulled harder. 

The door flew open. 

I let out a scream as an ugly green monster burst out of the clock. It 
grabbed me and knocked me to the floor. 



3 


“Mom! Dad! Help!” I shrieked. 

The monster raised its long claws over me. I covered my face, waiting 
to be slashed. 

“Goochy goochy goo!” The monster giggled and tickled me with its 
claws. 

I opened my eyes. Tara! Tara in her old Halloween costume! 

She rolled on the floor, giggling. “You’re so easy to scare!” she 
shouted. “You should have seen your face when I jumped out of the clock!” 

“It’s not funny!” I cried. “It’s—” 

Gong. 

Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo! 

The bird popped out of the clock and started cuckooing. Okay, I admit 
it scared me again. But did Tara have to clutch her sides, laughing at me 
that way? 

“What’s going on in here?” Dad stood in the doorway, glaring down at 
us. 

He pointed at the clock. “What’s that door doing open? Michael, I told 
you to stay away from the clock!” 

“ME?” I cried. 

“He was trying to catch the cuckoo,” Tara lied. 

“I thought so,” Dad said. 

“Dad, that’s not true! Tara’s the one who—” 

“Enough of that, Michael. I’m sick of hearing you blame Tara every 
time you do something wrong. Maybe your mother is right. Maybe I have 
been encouraging your imagination a little too much.” 

“That’s not fair!” I yelled. “I don’t have any imagination! I never make 
anything up!” 

“Dad, he’s lying,” Tara said. “I came in here and saw him playing with 
the clock. I tried to stop him.” 

Dad nodded, swallowing every word his precious Tara said. 

There was nothing I could do. I stormed off to my room and slammed 
the door. 



Tara was the biggest pain in the world, and she never got blamed for 
anything. She even mined my birthday. 

I turned twelve three days ago. Usually, people like their birthday. It’s 
supposed to be fun, right? 

Not for me. Tara made sure my birthday was the worst day of my life. 
Or at least one of the worst. 

First, she ruined my present. 

I could tell my parents were very excited about this present. My 
mother kept hopping around like a chicken, saying, “Don’t go in the garage, 
Michael! Whatever you do, don’t go in the garage!” 

I knew she’d hidden my present in there. But just to torture her, I 
asked, “Why not? Why can’t I go in the garage? The lock on my bedroom 
door is broken, and I need to borrow one of Dad’s tools....” 

“No, no!” Mom exclaimed. “Tell your father to fix the lock. He’ll get 
the tools. You can’t go in there, because... well... there’s a huge mound of 
trash in there. It really stinks. It smells so bad, you could get sick from it!” 

Sad, isn’t it? And she thinks I get my “imagination” from Dad! 

“All right, Mom,” I promised. “I won’t go in the garage.” 

And I didn’t—even though the lock on my door really was broken. I 
didn’t want to spoil whatever surprise they had cooked up. 

They were throwing me a big birthday party that afternoon. A bunch of 
kids from school were coming over. Mom baked a cake and made snacks 
for the party. Dad ran around the house, setting up chairs and hanging crepe 
paper. 

“Dad, would you mind fixing the lock on my door?” I asked. 

I like my privacy—and I need that lock. Tara had broken it a week 
earlier. She’d been trying to kickbox the door down. 

“Sure, Michael,” Dad agreed. “Anything you say. After all, you’re the 
birthday boy.” 

“Thanks.” 

Dad took the toolbox upstairs and worked on the lock. Tara lounged 
around the dining room making trouble. As soon as Dad was gone, she 
pulled down a crepe paper streamer and left it lying on the floor. 

Dad fixed the lock and returned the tools to the garage. As he passed 
through the dining room, he noticed the torn-down streamer. 



“Why won’t this crepe paper stay up?” he mumbled. He taped it back 
up. A few minutes later, Tara tore it down again. 

“I know what you’re doing, Tara,” I told her. “Stop trying to wreck my 
birthday.” 

“I don’t have to wreck it,” she said. “It’s bad all by itself—just because 
it’s the day you were born.” She pretended to shudder in horror. 

I ignored her. It was my birthday. Nothing could keep me from having 
fun, not even Tara. 

That’s what I thought 

About half an hour before the party, Mom and Dad called me into the 
garage. 

I pretended to go along with Mom’s silly story. “What about the 
horrible trash?” 

“Oh, that,” Mom clucked. “I made it up.” 

“Really?” I said. “Wow. It was so believable.” 

“If you believed that, you must be a moron,” Tara said. 

Dad threw open the garage door. I stepped inside. 

There stood a brand-new 21-speed bike. The bike I’d wanted for a 
long time. 

The coolest bike I’d ever seen! 

“Do you like it?” Mom asked. 

“I love it!” I cried. “It’s awesome! Thanks!” 

“Cool bike, Mike,” Tara said. “Mom, I want one of these for my 
birthday.” 

Before I could stop her, she climbed up on the seat of my new bike. 

“Tara, get off!” I yelled. 

She didn’t listen. She tried to reach her feet to the pedals, but her legs 
were too short. The bike fell over. 

“Tara!” Mom cried, running to the little brat’s side. “Are you hurt?” 

Tara stood up and brushed herself off. “I’m okay. I scraped my knee a 
little, though.” 

I picked up my bike and inspected it. It was no longer perfectly shiny 
and black. There was a huge white scratch across the middle bar. 

It was practically ruined. 

“Tara, you wrecked my bike! ” 

“Let’s not get overexcited, Michael,” Dad said. “It’s only a scratch.” 



“Don’t you even care about your sister?” Mom asked. “She could’ve 
been hurt!” 

“It’s her own fault! She shouldn’t have touched my bike in the first 
place!” 

“Michael, you have a lot to learn about being a good brother,” Dad 

said. 

They make me so mad sometimes! 

“Let’s go inside,” Mom said. “Your friends will be here soon.” 

The party. I thought the party would make me feel better. After all, 
there would be cake, presents, and my best friends. What could go wrong? 

It started out okay. One by one my friends arrived, and they all brought 
me presents. I’d invited five guys: David, Josh, Michael B., Henry, and 
Lars; and three girls: Ceecee, Rosie, and Mona. 

I wasn’t so crazy about Ceecee and Rosie, but I really liked Mona. She 
has long, shiny brown hair and a turned-up nose that’s kind of cute. She’s 
tall, and good at basketball. There’s something sort of cool about her. 

Ceecee and Rosie are Mona’s best friends. I had to invite them if I was 
going to invite Mona. They always go everywhere together. 

Ceecee, Rosie, and Mona arrived all at once. They took off their 
jackets. Mona was wearing pink overalls over a white turtleneck. She 
looked great. I didn’t care what the other girls were wearing. 

“Happy birthday, Michael!” they all called out at the door. 

“Thanks,” I said. 

They each handed me a gift. Mona’s was small and flat and wrapped in 
silver paper. Probably a CD, I figured. But which one? What kind of CD 
would a girl like Mona think a guy like me would like? 

I set the presents on top of the pile in the living room. 

“Hey, Michael—what did your parents give you?” David asked. 

“Just a bike,” I said, trying to be cool about it. “A twenty-one speed.” 

I put on a CD. Mom and Tara brought in plates of sandwiches. Mom 
went back to the kitchen, but Tara stayed. 

“Your little sister is so cute,” Mona said. 

“Not once you get to know her,” I muttered. 

“Michael! That’s not very nice,” Mona said. 

“He’s a terrible big brother,” Tara told her. “He yells at me all the 


time.” 



“I do not! Get lost, Tara.” 

“I don’t have to.” She stuck her tongue out at me. 

“Let her stay, Michael,” Mona said. “She’s not bothering anybody.” 

“Hey, Mona,” Tara chirped. “You know, Michael really likes you.” 

Mona’s eyes widened. “He does?” 

My face got red-hot. I glared at Tara. I wanted to strangle her right 
then and there. But I couldn’t—too many witnesses. 

Mona started laughing. Ceecee and Rosie laughed, too. Luckily, the 
guys didn’t hear this. They were around the CD player, skipping from cut to 
cut. 

What could I say? I did like Mona. I couldn’t deny it—it would hurt 
her feelings. But I couldn’t admit it, either. 

I wanted to die. I wanted to sink through the floor and die. 

“Michael, your face is all red!” Mona cried. 

Lars heard this and called out, “What did Webster do now?” 

Some of the guys call me by my last name. 

I grabbed Tara and dragged her into the kitchen, Mona’s laughter 
ringing in my ears. 

“Thanks a lot, Tara,” I whispered. “Why did you have to tell Mona I 
like her?” 

“It’s true, isn’t it?” the brat said. “I always tell the truth.” 

“Yeah, right!” 

“Michael—” Mom interrupted. “Are you being mean to Tara again?” 

I stormed out of the kitchen without answering her. 

“Hey, Webster,” Josh called when I returned to the living room. “Let’s 
see your new bike.” 

Good, I thought. A way to get away from the girls. 

I led them to the garage. They all stared at the bike and nodded at each 
other. They seemed really impressed. Then Henry grabbed the handlebars. 

“Hey, what’s this big scratch?” he said. 

“I know,” I explained. “My sister...” 

I stopped and shook my head. What was the use? 

“Let’s go back and open my presents,” I suggested. 

We trooped back into the living room. 

At least I’ve got more presents coming, I thought. Tara can’t ruin 
those. 



But Tara always finds a way. 

When I entered the living room, I found Tara sitting in the middle of a 
pile of torn-up wrapping paper. Rosie, Mona, and Ceecee sat around her, 
watching. 

Tara had opened all my presents for me. 

Thanks so much, Tara. 

She was ripping open the last present—Mona’s. 

“Look what Mona gave you, Michael!” Tara shouted. 

It was a CD. 

“I’ve heard there are some great love songs on it,” Tara teased. 

Everybody laughed. They all thought Tara was a riot. 

Later, we all sat down in the dining room for cake and ice cream. I carried 
the cake myself. Mom followed me, holding plates, candles, and matches. 

It was my favorite kind of cake, chocolate-chocolate. 

Balancing the cake in my hands, I stepped through the kitchen door 
and into the dining room. 

I didn’t see Tara pressed against the wall. I didn’t see her stick her 
bratty little foot in the doorway. 

I tripped. The cake flew out of my hands. 

I landed on top of the cake. Facedown. Of course. 

Some kids gasped. Some tried to muffle their laughter. 

I sat up and wiped the brown frosting from my eyes. 

The first face I saw was Mona’s. She was shaking with laughter. 

Mom leaned over and scolded me. “What a mess! Michael, why don’t 
you look where you’re going?” 

I listened to the laughter and stared at my ruined cake. I had no candles 
to blow out now. But it didn’t matter. I decided to make a wish, anyway. 

I wish I could start this birthday all over again. 

I stood up, covered in gooey brown cake. My friends howled. 

“You look like the Hulk!” Rosie cried. 

Everybody laughed harder than ever. 

They all had a great time at my party. Everyone did. 

Except for me. 

My birthday was bad—very bad. But ruining it wasn’t the worst thing 
Tara did to me. 



Nobody would believe the worst thing.

It happened the week before my birthday. Mona, Ceecee, and Rosie were 
coming over. We all had parts in the school play, and planned to rehearse 
together at my house. 

The play was a new version of The Frog Prince. Mona played the 
princess, and Ceecee and Rosie were her two silly sisters. Perfect casting, I 
thought. 

I played the frog, before the princess kisses him and turns him into a 
prince. For some reason, our drama teacher didn’t want me to play the 
prince. Josh got that part. 

Anyway, I decided that the frog is a better part. Because Mona, the 
princess, kisses the frog, not the prince. 

The girls would arrive any minute. 

Tara sat on the rug in the den, torturing our cat, Bubba. Bubba hated 
Tara almost as much as I did. 

Tara lifted Bubba by the hind legs, trying to make him do a handstand. 
Bubba yowled and squirmed and wriggled away. But Tara caught him and 
made him do a handstand again. 

“Stop that, Tara,” I ordered. 

“Why?” Tara said. “It’s fun.” 

“You’re hurting Bubba.” 

“No, I’m not. He likes it. See? He’s smiling.” She let go of his hind 
legs and grabbed him with one hand under his front legs. With the other 
hand she lifted the corners of his mouth and stretched them into a pained 
smile. 

Bubba tried to bite her. He missed. 

“Tara,” I said, “let him go. And get out of here. My friends are coming 
over.” 

“No.” Now Tara tried to make Bubba walk on his front paws. He fell 
and bumped his nose. 

“Tara, stop it!” I cried. As I tried to take Bubba away from her, she let 
the cat go. Bubba meowed and scratched me across the arm. 

“Ow!” I dropped Bubba. He ran away. 



“Michael, what were you doing to that cat?” Mom stood in the 
doorway. Bubba slipped past her into the hall. 

“Nothing! He scratched me!” 

“Stop teasing him, and he won’t scratch you,” Mom scolded. She left, 
calling over her shoulder, “I’m going upstairs to lie down for a while. I have 
a headache.” 

The doorbell rang. “We’ll get it, Mom!” I called. 

I knew it must be the girls at the door. I wanted to surprise them in my 
frog costume, but I wasn’t ready yet. 

“Answer the door, Tara,” I told the brat. “Tell Mona and the others to 
wait for me in the den. I’ll be right back.” 

“Okay,” Tara said. She trotted off to the front door. I hurried upstairs to 
change into my costume. 

I pulled the costume out of my closet. I took off my pants and shirt. I 
picked up the frog suit, trying to open the zipper. It was stuck. 

I stood there in my underwear, tugging at the zipper. Then my 
bedroom door clicked open. 

“Here he is, girls,” I heard Tara say. “He told me to bring you 
upstairs.” 

No! I thought. Please don’t let it be true! 

I was afraid to look up. I knew what I’d see. 

The door wide open. Mona, Ceecee, Rosie, and Tara, staring at me in 
my underwear! 

I forced myself to look. It was worse than I’d thought. 

There they all stood—staring and laughing! 

Tara laughed hardest of all. She laughed like a rotten little hyena. 

You think that’s bad? Wait. There’s more. 


* * * 


Two days before the underwear disaster, I was hanging around after school, 
playing basketball in the gym with Josh, Henry, and some other guys, 
including Kevin Flowers. 

Kevin is a good player, big and tough. He is twice as tall as me! He 
loves basketball. The Duke Blue Devils are his favorite college team. He 
wears a Blue Devils cap to school every day. 



While we were shooting baskets, I spied Tara hanging around the 
sidelines, where we’d all tossed our jackets and backpacks against the wall. 

I got a bad feeling. I always do when Tara’s around. 

What’s she doing there? I wondered. 

Maybe her teacher kept her after school, and she’s waiting for me to 
walk her home. 

She’s just trying to distract me, I told myself. Don’t let her. Don’t think 
about her. Just concentrate on the game. 

I felt good. I actually sank a few baskets before the game ended. My 
side won. We had Kevin Flowers on our team, that’s why. 

We all jogged to the wall to get our packs. Tara was gone. 

Funny, I thought. I guess she went home without me. 

I hoisted my pack over my shoulder and said, “See you tomorrow, 
guys.” 

But Kevin’s voice boomed through the gym. “Nobody move!” 

We all froze. 

“Where’s my cap?” he demanded. “My Blue Devils cap is missing!” 

I shrugged. I didn’t know where his stupid cap was. 

“Somebody took my cap,” Kevin insisted. “Nobody leaves until we 
find it.” 

He grabbed Henry’s backpack and started pawing through it. Everyone 
knows how much Kevin loves that cap. 

But Josh pointed at me. “Hey—what’s that hanging out of Webster’s 
pack?” he asked. 

“My pack?” I cried. I glanced over my shoulder. 

I saw a patch of blue sticking out of the zippered pocket. 

My stomach lurched. 

Kevin strode over to me and ripped the cap out of my pack. 

“I don’t know how it got there, Kevin,” I insisted. “I swear—” 

Kevin didn’t wait to hear my excuses. He never was much of a listener. 

Til spare you the blood and gore. Let’s just say my clothes didn’t fit 
too well when Kevin got through taking me apart! 

Josh and Henry helped me home. My mom didn’t recognize me. My 
eyes and nose had traded places with my chin. 

While I was in the bathroom cleaning myself up, I caught a glimpse of 
Tara in the mirror. The bratty grin on her face told me all I needed to know. 



“You!” I cried. “You put Kevin’s cap in my pack! Didn’t you!” 

Tara just grinned. Yeah. She did it, all right. 

“Why?” I demanded. “Why did you do it, Tara?” 

Tara shrugged and tried to look innocent. “Was that Kevin’s cap?” she 
said. “I thought it was yours.” 

“What a lie!” I cried. “I never wore a Duke cap, and you know it! You 
did that on purpose!” 

I was so furious, I couldn’t stand to look at her. I slammed the 
bathroom door in her face. 

And of course I got in trouble for slamming the door. 

Now you understand what I had to live with. 

Now you know why I did the terrible thing that I did. 

Anyone in my place would have done the same.

I stayed in my room that night, thinking hard. Plotting a way to get Tara in 
trouble. 

But nothing came to me. At least, nothing good enough. 

Then the clock arrived. A few days later, Tara did something that gave 
me an idea. 

Tara couldn’t stay away from the cuckoo clock. One afternoon, Dad 
caught Tara playing with the clock hands. She didn’t get into any real 
trouble, of course—not sweet little Tara. But Dad did say, “I’ve got my eye 
on you, young lady. No more playing with the clock.” 

At last! I thought. At last Dad realizes that Tara’s not a perfect angel. 
And at last I’ve found a way to get her into big trouble. 

If something went wrong with the clock, I knew Tara would be blamed 
for it. 

So I decided to make sure something did go wrong. 

Tara deserved to get into trouble for the hundreds of terrible things she 
did to me. 

So what if just once she gets blamed for something she didn’t do? I 
thought. It’s only evening the score a little. 

That night, after everybody was asleep, I sneaked downstairs to the 

den. 

It was almost midnight. I crept up to the clock and waited. 

One minute to go. 

Thirty seconds. 

Ten seconds. 

Six, five, four, three, two, one... 

The gong sounded. 

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 

The yellow bird popped out. I grabbed it in mid-cuckoo. It made short, 
strangling noises. 

I twisted its head around, so it faced backwards. It looked really funny 
that way. 

It finished out its twelve cuckoos, facing the wrong way. 



I laughed to myself. When Dad saw it, he’d go ballistic ! 

The cuckoo slid back into its little window, still facing backwards. 

This is going to drive Dad insane! I thought wickedly. 

He’ll be furious at Tara. He’ll explode like a volcano! 

Finally, Tara will know what it feels like to be blamed for something 
you didn’t do. 

I crept back upstairs. Not a sound. No one saw me. 

I fell asleep that night a happy guy. There’s nothing like revenge. 

I slept late the next morning. I couldn’t wait to see Dad blow up at Tara. I 
just hoped I hadn’t missed it already. 

I hurried downstairs. I checked the den. 

The door stood open. 

No one there. No sign of trouble yet. 

Good, I thought. I haven’t missed it. 

I made my way into the kitchen, hungry. Mom, Dad, and Tara sat 
around the table, piled with empty breakfast dishes. 

As soon as they saw me, their faces lit up. 

“Happy Birthday!” they cried all at once. 

“Very funny,” I snapped. I opened a cabinet. “Is there any more cereal 
left?” 

“Cereal!” Mom said. “Don’t you want something special, like 
pancakes?” 

I scratched my head. “Well, sure. Pancakes would be great.” 

This was a little strange. Usually if I woke up late, Mom said I had to 
fix my own breakfast. And why should I want something special, anyway? 

Mom mixed a fresh batch of pancake batter. “Don’t go in the garage, 
Michael! Whatever you do, don’t go in the garage!” She hopped up and 
down, all excited. Just as if it were my birthday again. 

Weird. 

“.. .there’s a huge mound of trash in there,” Mom was saying. “It really 
stinks. It smells so bad, you could get sick from it!” 

“Mom, what’s with the trash story?” I asked. “I didn’t believe it the 
first time.” 

“Just don’t go into the garage,” she repeated. 

Why was she saying this to me? Why was she acting so weird? 



Dad excused himself, saying, “I’ve got a few important chores to do,” 
in a strange, jolly way. 

I shrugged and tried to eat my breakfast in peace. But after breakfast I 
passed through the dining room. Somebody had decorated it with crepe 
paper. One strand had been torn down. 

Weird. Totally weird. 

Dad came into the room, toolbox in hand. He picked up the torn piece 
of crepe paper and started to tape it back up again. 

“Why won’t this crepe paper stay up?” he asked. 

“Dad,” I said. “Why are you covering the dining room with crepe 
paper?” 

Dad smiled. “Because it’s your birthday, of course! Every birthday 
party needs crepe paper. Now, I bet you can’t wait to see your present, 
right?” 

I stared at him. 

What’s going on here? I wondered.

Mom and Dad led me to the garage. Tara followed. They all acted as if they 
were really going to give me a birthday present. 

Dad opened the garage door. 

There it was. The bike. 

It was perfectly shiny and new-looking. No scratches anywhere. 

That must be the surprise, I thought. They figured out a way to get rid 
of the scratch somehow. Or maybe they got me another new bike! 

“Do you like it?” Mom asked. 

“It’s awesome!” I replied. 

Tara said, “Cool bike, Mike. Mom, I want one of these for my 
birthday.” 

Then she jumped up on the seat. The bike fell over on her. When we 
pulled it up, it had a big scratch on it. 

Mom cried, “Tara! Are you hurt?” 

I couldn’t believe it. What a nightmare! 

It was happening all over again. Exactly as it had happened on my 
birthday. 

What’s going on? 

“What’s wrong, Michael?” Dad asked. “Don’t you like the bike?” 

What could I say? I felt sick. I felt so confused. 

Then it dawned on me. 

It must have been my wish, I thought. 

My birthday wish. 

After Tara tripped me and I fell on my cake, I wished I could go back 
in time and start my birthday all over again. 

Somehow my wish came tme. 

Wow! I thought. This is kind of cool. 

“Let’s go inside,” Mom said. “The party guests will be here soon.” 

The party? 

Oh, no. 

Please, no! 



Do I have to live through that horrible party again? 



7 


Yes. 

Yes, I had to live through the whole horrible nightmare again. 

My friends all showed up, just like the first time. 

I heard Tara say the awful words, “Hey, Mona. You know, Michael 
really likes you.” 

Mona said, “He does?” 

You already knew that, Mona, I thought. Tara told you four days ago. 

You were standing in that very same spot. Wearing those same pink 
overalls. 

Mona, Ceecee, and Rosie cracked up. 

I panicked. This can’t go on, I thought. 

My mother came in, carrying a tray of soda. I grabbed her. 

“Mom,” I begged. “Please take Tara away. Shut her up in her room or 
something!” 

“Michael, why? Your sister wants to have fun, too.” 

“Mom— please !” 

“Oh, Michael, you’re being silly. Be nice to Tara. She won’t bother 
you. She’s just a little girl.” 

Mom left the room, stranding me with Tara and my friends. 

She couldn’t save me. 

No one could. 

I showed the guys my new bike. Henry said, “Hey, what’s this big 
scratch?” 

When we got back to the living room, there were all my presents, 
opened by Tara. 

“Look what Mona gave you, Michael!” Tara shouted. 

I know, I know, I thought. A CD. With great love songs on it. 

“I’ve heard there are some great love songs on it,” Tara repeated. 

Everybody laughed. 

It was just as bad as before. 

No. Worse. Because I could see it all coming. And I couldn’t stop it. 



Could I? 

“Michael,” Mom called. “Come into the kitchen, please. It’s time for 
the birthday cake!” 

Here’s the test, I thought, dragging myself into the kitchen. 

I’ll carry in the cake—but this time I won’t trip. 

I know Tara is going to try and trip me. I won’t let her. 

I won’t make a fool of myself this time. 

I don’t have to. I don’t have to repeat everything the same way. 

Do I? 



8 


I stood in the kitchen, staring at the cake. I could hear my friends laughing 
and talking in the dining room. Tara was in there, too. 

I knew she was standing just beyond the dining room door, waiting. 
Waiting to stick out her foot and trip me. Waiting to make me fall on my 
face and embarrass myself all over again. 

Not this time. 

I carefully picked up the cake in both hands. I started toward the 
dining room. 

Mom followed, just as before. 

I stopped in front of the entrance to the dining room. I glanced down. 
No sign of Tara’s foot. 

Carefully, watching closely, I stepped through the door. One step. 

So far, so good. 

Another step. I stood inside the dining room now. 

I’d made it! All I had to do was get to the table, about five steps away, 
and I’d be safe. 

I took another step forward. Another. 

Then I felt a tug on my foot. 

Tara reached out from under the table. 

So that was where she’d been hiding. I knew it now. But it was too 

late. 

Everything seemed to move in slow motion. Like in a dream. 

I heard an evil giggle. 

She grabbed my foot. 

Oh, no, I thought. It’s happened. 

I lost my balance. 

As I fell, I turned my head and glanced back. 

Tara sat under that table, smirking at me. 

I wanted to kill her. 

But first I had to fall on my face on a cake. 

The cake flew out of my arms. I turned my head again. 



Splat! 

Everybody gasped with laughter. I sat up and wiped the frosting from 
my eyes. 

Mona leaned over the table, laughing harder than anybody. 

The second time was more embarrassing than the first. 

I sat on the floor, my face covered with cake, thinking, how could I 
have been so stupid? 

Why did I have to make that wish? 

I’ll never wish for anything ever again. 

I cleaned myself up and managed to survive the rest of the party. When 
I went to bed that night, I thought, at least it’s over. 

I switched off the light and pulled the covers up high. 

It’s over, I repeated. I’ll go to sleep, and everything will be back to 
normal in the morning. 

I shut my eyes and fell asleep. But in my dreams, all night long, I saw 
scenes from my horrible birthday party. The nightmare party became a real 
nightmare. 

There was Tara, telling Mona that I liked her. Mona’s face loomed up 
large in my dreams, laughing, laughing. Ceecee and Rosie and the guys, all 
laughing right in my face. 

I tripped and fell on top of the cake, over and over again. 

I tossed and turned. Each dream was scarier than the last. Soon my 
friends looked like horrible monsters. And Tara was the most horrible of all. 
Her features melted into a blur as she laughed and laughed at me. 

Wake up, I told myself. Wake up! 

I dragged myself out of the nightmare world. I sat up in bed, in a cold 
sweat. 

The room was still dark. I glanced at the clock. 

Three o’clock in the morning. 

I can’t sleep, I thought miserably. I can’t calm down. 

I’ve got to tell Mom and Dad what happened. Maybe they can help. 

Maybe they can make me feel better. 

I climbed out of bed and hurried down the dark hall to their room. 
Their door was open a crack. 

I pushed it open. 

“Mom? Dad? Are you awake?” 



Dad rolled over and grunted, “Huh?” 

I shook Mom’s shoulder. “Mom?” 

Mom stirred. “What is it, Michael?” she whispered. She sat up and 
grabbed the clock radio. In the clock’s dim blue glow I saw her squint, 
trying to read the time. 

“It’s three o’clock!” she cried. 

Dad snorted and sat up suddenly. “Huh? What?” 

“Mom, you’ve got to listen to me!” I whispered. “Something creepy 
happened today. Didn’t you notice it?” 

“Michael, what is this—” 

“My birthday,” I explained. “Tara ruined my birthday, and I wished I 
could have it all over again. I wanted to make it better. But I never thought 
the wish would come true! Then, today, it was my birthday again! And 
everything happened exactly the same. It was horrible!” 

Dad rubbed his eyes. “That you, Michael?” 

Mom patted him. “Go back to sleep, dear. Michael’s just had a bad 
dream.” 

“No, Mom,” I cried. “It wasn’t a dream. It was real! My birthday 
happened twice! You were there, both times. Don’t you understand?” 

“Listen, Michael,” Mom began. I heard impatience in her voice. “I 
know you’re excited about your birthday, but it’s two days away. Only two 
days to go—then it will be your birthday at last! Okay? So go back to bed 
now and get some sleep.” 

She kissed me good night. “Only two days till your birthday. Sweet 
dreams.”

I staggered back to bed, my head spinning. 

Two days until my birthday? 

Hadn’t I just lived through my birthday—twice? 

I switched on the reading lamp and stared at the date on my watch. 
February third, it said. 

My birthday is February fifth. My birthday was two days away. 

Could it be true? Was time going backwards? 

No, I thought. I must be going nuts. 

I shook my head hard. I slapped myself a few times. Going back in 
time. I laughed at the idea. 

It’s impossible, I thought. Get a hold of yourself, Michael. 

All I did was wish to celebrate my birthday over again— once. 

I didn’t wish to repeat my twelfth birthday for the rest of my life! 

But if that’s what’s happening, why is it now two days before my 
birthday? Why isn’t it just the night before? 

Maybe time really is going backwards, I thought. Maybe this has 
nothing to do with my wish. 

But, then—why is this happening to me? 

I racked my brains. 

The clock. Dad’s cuckoo clock. 

I twisted the cuckoo’s head backwards... went to bed... and when I 
woke up, time had gone backwards. 

Could that be it? Did / do this? 

Is Dad’s clock really magic? 

Maybe I shouldn’t have turned that stupid bird backwards, I decided. It 
figures—I try to get Tara in trouble, and end up getting myself into a 
horrible mess. 

Well, if that is what happened, it’s easy enough to fix. 

I’ll just go downstairs and turn the cuckoo’s head back around. 

I tiptoed out of my room and down the stairs. My parents had probably 
fallen back to sleep already, but I didn’t want to take any chances. 



I definitely didn’t want Dad to catch me fooling around with his 
precious clock. 

My feet hit the cold, bare floor of the foyer. I crept into the den. I 
switched on a lamp. I glanced around the room. The cuckoo clock was 
gone! 



10 


“No!” I cried. 

Had the clock been stolen? 

Without the clock, how could I fix everything? How could I turn the 
bird’s head around and make my life go forward again? 

I raced upstairs. I didn’t care who I woke up now. 

“Mom! Dad!” I yelled. I burst into their room and shook Mom awake 
again. 

“Michael, what is it?” She sounded furious. “It’s the middle of the 
night. We’re trying to get some sleep!” 

Let them be angry, I thought. This was way more important. 

“The cuckoo clock! It’s gone!” 

Dad rolled over. “What? Huh?” 

“Michael, you’ve had another nightmare,” Mom assured me. 

“It’s not a nightmare, Mom—it’s true! Go downstairs and see for 
yourself! There’s no cuckoo clock in the den!” 

“Michael—listen to me. It was a dream.” Mom’s voice was firm. “We 
don’t own a cuckoo clock. We never did.” 

I staggered backwards. 

“It’s just a dream. A bad dream,” she said. 

“But Dad bought it....” 

I stopped. 

I understood now. 

The date was February third. Two days before my birthday. 

And five days before Dad bought the cuckoo clock. 

We were traveling back in time. Dad hadn’t bought the clock yet. 

I felt sick. 

Mom said, “Michael, are you all right?” She climbed out of bed and 
pressed the back of her hand against my forehead. 

“You feel a little warm,” she said, nicer now that she thought I might 
be sick. “Come on, let’s get you to bed. I’ll bet you have a fever—and that’s 
why you’re having all these nightmares.” 



Dad grunted again. “What? Sick?” 

“I’ll take care of it, Herman,” Mom whispered. “Go back to sleep.” 

She guided me back to bed. She thought I was sick. 

But I knew the truth. 

I had made time move backwards. And the clock was gone. How 
would I fix things now? 

By the time I got to the kitchen the next morning, Mom, Dad, and Tara had 
already eaten. 

“Hurry up, Michael,” Dad said. “You’ll be late.” 

Being late for school didn’t seem to matter much at the moment. 

“Dad, please sit down for a second,” I pleaded. “Just for a minute. It’s 
important.” 

Dad sat, impatiently, on the edge of a kitchen chair. “Michael, what is 

it?” 

“Mom, are you listening?” I asked. 

“Sure, honey,” Mom said. She put the milk in the refrigerator and 
busily wiped off the counter. 

“This is going to sound weird,” I began. “But I’m not kidding.” 

I paused. Dad waited. I could tell by the tension in his face he expected 
me to say something totally dopey. 

I didn’t disappoint him. 

“Dad, time is going backwards. Every day I wake up—and it’s an 
earlier day than the last!” 

Dad’s face drooped. “Michael, you have a wonderful imagination, but 
I’m really running late. Can we talk about it when I get home from work 
tonight? Or why don’t you write it down? You know I love reading science 
fiction stories.” 

“But, Dad—” 

Mom said, “Did somebody remember to feed the cat?” 

“I did it,” Tara said. “Even though it’s supposed to be Michael’s job.” 
“Thanks, Tara,” Mom said. “Let’s hit the road, everybody.” 

I grabbed a muffin as Mom hustled us out the door. 

They’re too busy to understand right now, I reasoned as I hurried to 
school. Tonight, at dinner, when I have more time to explain... 

I had lots of time to think about my problem during school. I’d lived 



through this day before, too. I’d already done all the work, heard all the 
lessons, eaten the lousy lunch. 

When my math teacher, Mr. Parker, turned his back to the class, I 
knew what would happen next. I predicted it to the second. Kevin Flowers 
threw an eraser at him and hit him smack on the back of his black pants. 

Now Mr. Parker is going to turn around... I thought, watching Mr. 
Parker. 

He turned around. 

.. .now he’ll yell at Kevin... 

Mr. Parker shouted, “Kevin Flowers—to the principal’s office, now!” 

.. .now Kevin will start yelling his head off. 

“How do you know it was me!” Kevin yelled. “You didn’t see me do 
anything!” 

The rest of the scene happened as I remembered it. Mr. Parker cowered 
a bit—Kevin is pretty big—but told Kevin to go to the principal’s office 
again. Kevin kicked over an empty chair and threw his books across the 
room. 

It was all so boring. 

After school, I found Tara in the den, teasing Bubba. She lifted his 
hind legs and made him walk on his front paws. 

“Tara, stop it!” I cried. I tried to take Bubba away from her. She let the 
cat go. Bubba meowed and scratched me across the arm. 

“Ow!” I dropped Bubba. He ran away. 

It felt very familiar. And painful. 

“Michael, what were you doing to that cat?” Mom demanded. 

“Nothing! He scratched me!” 

“Stop teasing him, and he won’t scratch you,” Mom scolded. 

The doorbell rang. 

Oh, no. 

Mona, Ceecee, and Rosie. The Frog Prince. 

The underwear. 

I can’t let it happen. 

But my feet started taking me upstairs. I was walking like a robot to 
my room. 

Why am I doing this? I asked myself. 

I’ll get out my frog costume. The zipper will be stuck. 



Tara will open the door, and I’ll be standing there in my underpants. 
Mona will laugh her head off. I’ll want to sink through the floor. 

I know all this will happen. 

So why am I doing it? 

Can’t I stop myself? 



11 


Don’t go upstairs, I begged myself. Don’t go to your room. 

You don’t have to do this. 

There must be a way to stop it, to control it. 

I forced myself to turn around. I walked back down the steps. I sat 
down on the third step. 

Tara answered the door, and soon the girls stood before me in the 
foyer. 

Okay, I thought. I’m controlling it. Already things are happening 
differently from before. 

“Michael, where’s your costume?” Mona asked. “I really want to see 
what your costume looks like.” 

“Uh, no you don’t,” I said, shrinking a little. “It’s really ugly, and I 
don’t want to scare you girls—” 

“Don’t be a jerk, Michael,” Ceecee said. “Why would we be scared by 
a stupid frog costume?” 

“And, anyway, I want to rehearse with it,” Mona added. “I don’t want 
to see the costume for the first time onstage. I’ll need to be prepared for it. I 
need to practice with the costume—and you in it.” 

“Come on, Michael,” Tara put in. “Show them the costume. I want to 
see it, too.” 

I flashed her a dirty look. I knew what she had in mind. 

“No,” I insisted. “I can’t do that.” 

“Why not?” Mona demanded. 

“I just can’t.” 

“He’s shy!” Rosie exclaimed. 

“He’s embarrassed,” Tara added. 

“No, it’s not that,” I said. “It’s just that... it’s awfully hot in that 
costume, and—” 

Mona leaned close to me. I smelled something sweet, like 
strawberries. It must’ve been the shampoo she used. “Come on, Michael,” 
she said. “For me?” 

“No.” 



She stamped her foot. “I won’t rehearse our scenes unless you put on 
that costume!” 

I sighed. I didn’t see any way out of it. 

Mona wouldn’t leave me alone until I put on that frog costume. 

I gave in. “Okay.” 

“Hurray!” Tara cried. I gave her another dirty look. 

All right, I thought. I may have to put on the costume. But that doesn’t 
mean the girls have to see me in my underwear. 

I can still keep that from happening. 

I trudged up to my room. But this time, I locked the door. 

Now try to embarrass me, Tara, I thought. You can’t outsmart Michael 
Webster. No way. 

The door was locked. I felt sure I was safe. 

I took off my jeans and my shirt. I dragged the frog costume out of the 
closet. 

I tugged on the zipper. It was stuck. 

Just like the last time. 

But this time it’s okay, I told myself. The door is locked. I have 
privacy. 

Then the door flew open. 

I stood helplessly in my underwear. Mona, Rosie, and Ceecee stared at 
me. Then they screamed and started laughing. 

“Tara!” I yelled. “The door was locked!” 

“No, it wasn’t,” Tara replied. “The lock’s broken, remember?” 

“No!” I cried. “Dad fixed it... he fixed it...” 

I tried to remember when Dad had fixed the lock on my bedroom door. 
Oh, right. 

It was after the underwear nightmare. On my birthday. 

So it hadn’t happened yet. 

How was I supposed to keep all this straight? 

Oh, no, I thought. I’m doomed. 

Time is all messed up. And I have no way of stopping it. 

I began to shake. This was too frightening. 

Where would it end? I had no idea. It was getting scarier by the 
minute. 



I could hardly eat dinner that night. I’d eaten it before, of course, and hadn’t 
liked it the first time. Peas, carrots, and mushrooms. Over brown rice. 

I picked at the rice and the carrots. I never eat peas. I slipped them into 
my napkin when Mom and Dad weren’t looking. 

I watched Mom, Dad, and Tara eat dinner as if nothing were wrong. 
They sat calmly around the table, saying the same things they’d said last 
time. 

Mom and Dad must notice that something is weird, I thought. They 
must. 

So why don’t they say anything about it? 

I waited for Dad to finish telling us about his day at work. Then I 
brought up the subject again. I decided to take it slowly. 

“Mom? Dad? Doesn’t this dinner seem a little bit familiar?” 

“I’ll say,” Dad replied. “It reminds me of the lunch we ate at that 
vegetarian restaurant last month. Ugh.” 

Mom glared at him, then at me. “What are you trying to tell us, 
Michael?” she said frostily. “Are you tired of eating healthy food?” 

“I am,” Dad said. 

“Me, too,” Tara chimed in. 

“No. No way,” I insisted. “You don’t understand. I don’t mean that 
we’ve eaten food like this before. I mean that we have eaten this very meal 
before. We’re eating it twice.” 

Dad frowned. “No weird theories at the dinner table, please, Michael.” 

They weren’t getting it. I plowed ahead. “It’s not just this dinner. It’s 
this whole day. Haven’t you noticed? We’re doing everything over! Time is 
going backwards!” 

“Shut up, Michael,” Tara said. “This is so boring. Can’t we talk about 
something else?” 

“Tara,” Mom scolded, “don’t say ‘shut up’.” She turned to me. “Have 
you been reading those comic books again?” 

I grew very frustrated. “You’re not listening to me!” I cried. 
“Tomorrow is going to be yesterday, and the day after that will be the day 
before! Everything is going backwards!” 

Mom and Dad exchanged glances. They seemed to be sharing a secret. 

They do know something, I thought with excitement. They know 
something, but they’re afraid to tell me. 



Mom gazed at me very seriously. “All right, Michael. We might as 
well tell you,” she said. “We’re all caught in a time warp, and there’s 
nothing we can do about it.” 



12 


Mom pushed back her chair. She walked backwards to the stove. She 
started dishing rice from her plate into the pot on the stove. 

“Yenoh, ecir erom?” she asked Dad. 

Huh? 

“Esaelp, sey,” Dad replied. 

“Oot, em,” Tara said. She spit some rice out on her fork and dumped it 
back on her plate. She was eating backwards! 

Dad stood up and walked backwards to Mom. Then Tara skipped 
backwards around the kitchen table. 

They were all talking and moving backwards. We really were in a time 
warp! 

“Hey!” I cried. “It’s true!” 

Why wasn’t I talking backwards, too? 

“Norom,” Tara said. 

She cracked up first. Then Dad started laughing. Then Mom. 

I finally caught on. It was a joke. “You—you’re all horrible !” I cried. 

That made them laugh even more. 

“I was wondering when you’d figure it out,” Tara sneered. 

They all sat down at the table again. Mom couldn’t help grinning. 
“We’re sorry, Michael. We didn’t mean to make fun of you.” 

“Yes we did!” Tara exclaimed. 

I stared at them in horror. 

This was the most terrible thing that had ever happened to me. And my 
parents thought it was a big joke. 

Then Dad said, “Michael, did you ever hear of dejr vu?” 

I shook my head. 

“It’s when something happens to you and you have the feeling it’s 
happened before,” he explained. “Everyone feels that way once in a while. 
It’s nothing to be afraid of.” 

“Maybe you’re nervous about something,” Mom added. “Like your 
birthday coming up. I’ll bet you’re a little nervous about turning twelve, 



right? And planning your party and everything?” 

“Not really,” I protested. “I know that feeling. But this isn’t the same 
thing! This is—” 

“Say, Mike,” Dad interrupted. “Wait till you see what I got you for 
your birthday. You’re going to flip! It’s a big surprise.” 

No, it isn’t, I thought unhappily. 

It’s not a surprise at all. You’ve given me that birthday present twice 
already. How many times are you going to give me that stupid bike? 

“Mom, Michael is hiding peas in his napkin again,” Tara ratted. 

I smushed the peas up in my napkin and threw it in her face. 

When I went to school the next morning, I wasn’t sure what day it was. It 
was getting hard to keep track. My classes, my lunch, the stuff my friends 
said all seemed familiar. But nothing unusual happened. It could have been 
any day of the school year. 

I played basketball after school that day, as usual. While I was playing, 
a funny feeling crept over me. 

A bad feeling. 

I’ve already played this game, I realized. And it didn’t end well. 

But I kept on playing, waiting to see what would happen. 

My team won. We collected our packs. 

Then Kevin Flowers yelled, “Where’s my Blue Devils cap?” 

Oh, yeah, I remembered. 

This was that basketball game. How could I forget? 

Good old Tara. She’s done it again! “Nobody leaves until we find that 
cap!” I shut my eyes and handed over my pack. I knew what was coming. 
Might as well get it over with. 

Getting pounded to a pulp by Kevin Flowers hurt a lot. But at least the pain 
didn’t last long. 

The next morning when I woke up, it was all gone. The pain, the 
scabs, the bruises, everything. 

What day is it today? I wondered. It must be a few days before Kevin 
beat me up. 

I hope I won’t have to live through that a third time. 

But what will happen today? 



As I walked to school, I searched for clues. I tried to remember what 
had happened a day or two before Kevin beat me up. 

A math test? Maybe. I hoped not. But at least it would be easier this 
time around. I could even try to remember what the problems were and look 
up all the answers before the test! 

I was a little late today. Did that mean something? I wondered. Would 
I get into trouble? 

My homeroom teacher, Ms. Jacobson, had closed the classroom door. I 
opened it. The classroom was already full. 

Ms. Jacobson didn’t look up when I walked in. 

I must not be that late, I thought. Guess I won’t get in trouble after all. 

I started for the back of the room, where I usually sit. As I passed 
through the rows of desks, I glanced at the other kids. 

Who’s that guy? I wondered, staring at a chubby, blond kid I’d never 
seen before. 

Then I noticed a pretty girl with cornrows and three earrings in one 
ear. I’d never seen her before, either. 

I stared at all the faces in the classroom. None of the kids looked 
familiar. 

What’s going on? I wondered, feeling panic choke my throat. 

I don’t know any of these kids! 

Where’s my class? 



13 


Ms. Jacobson finally turned around. She stared at me. 

“Hey,” the blond kid shouted. “What’s a third-grader doing in here?” 

Everybody laughed. I couldn’t understand why. 

A third-grader? Who was he talking about? 

I didn’t see any third-graders. 

“You’re in the wrong classroom, young man,” Ms. Jacobson said to 
me. She opened the door, showing me the way out. 

“I think your room is downstairs on the second floor,” she added. 

“Thanks,” I said. I didn’t know what she was talking about. But I 
decided to go along with her. 

She shut the door behind her. I could hear the kids laughing behind the 
door. I hurried down the hall to the boy’s bathroom. I needed to splash some 
cold water on my face. Maybe that would help. 

I turned on the cold water tap. Then I glanced in the mirror, very 
quickly. 

The mirror seems a little higher than usual, I thought. 

I washed my hands in the cold water and splashed some on my face. 

The sink seems higher, too, I noticed. Strange. 

Am I in the right school? 

I glanced in the mirror again—and got the shock of my life. 

Was that me? 

I looked so young. 

I ran my hand through my short, brushlike brown hair. That dopey 
crew cut I’d had ah through the third grade. 

I don’t believe it, I thought, shaking my head. I’m a third-grader again! 

I’ve got my third-grade hair. My third-grade clothes. My third-grade 
body. 

But my seventh-grade brain. I think. 

Third grade. 

That means I’ve slipped back four years—in one night. 

My whole body started to tremble. I grabbed on to the sink to steady 



myself. 

I was suddenly paralyzed with fear. 

Things were speeding up. Now I lost whole years in one night! How 
old will I be when I wake up tomorrow? I asked myself. 

Time was going backward faster and faster—and I still hadn’t found a 
way to stop it! 

I shut off the water and dried my face with a paper towel. I didn’t 
know what to do. I was so frightened, I couldn’t think straight. 

I walked back to my third-grade classroom. 

First I glanced through the window of the classroom door. There she 
was, Mrs. Harris, my old third-grade teacher. I’d know that helmet of silver 
hair anywhere. 

And I knew, as soon as I saw her, that I really had gone back in time 
four years. 

Because old Mrs. Harris shouldn’t have been in school that day. She’d 
retired two years earlier. When I was in fifth grade. 

I opened the door and stepped into the classroom. 

Mrs. Harris didn’t bat an eye. “Take a seat, Michael,” she commanded. 
She never mentioned the fact that I was late. 

Mrs. Harris always liked me. 

I checked out the other kids in the class. I saw Henry, Josh, Ceecee, 
and Mona, all little third-graders now. 

Mona wore her shiny brown hair in two braids. Ceecee wore hers in 
one of those stupid side ponytails. 

Josh didn’t have pimples on his forehead, I noticed. Henry had a 
sticker on the back of his hand—Donatello, from the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles. 

It was my class all right. 

I sat down at an empty desk in the back. My old desk. Right next to 
Henry. 

I glanced at him. He was picking his nose. 

Gross. I’d forgotten about that part of being a third-grader. 

“Michael, we’re on page 33 in your spelling book,” Mrs. Harris 
informed me. 

I reached inside the desk and found my spelling book. I opened it to 
page 33. 



“These are the words you’ll need to know for tomorrow’s spelling 
test,” Mrs. Harris announced. She wrote the words on the board, even 
though we could read them right there in the spelling book: Taste, sense, 
grandmother, easy, happiness. 

“Man,” Henry whispered to me. “These words are tough. Look how 
many letters there are in grandmother !” 

I didn’t know what to say to him. On my last spelling test (when I was 
still in the seventh grade), I’d had to spell psychology. Grandmother wasn’t 
a big challenge for me anymore. 

I zoned out for most of the day. I’d always wished school were easier, 
but not this easy. It was so babyish and boring. 

Lunch and recess were even worse. Josh chewed up a banana and 
stuck his tongue out at me. Henry painted his face with chocolate pudding. 

Finally the school day ended. I dragged my little third-grade body 
home. 

When I opened the front door, I heard a horrible screech. Bubba, just a 
kitten now, raced past me and out the door. Tara toddled after him. 

“Don’t tease the cat,” I scolded her. 

“You’re dumb,” she replied. 

I stared at Tara. She was three years old. 

I tried to remember: Had I liked her better when she was three? 

“Give me a piggyback!” she cried, tugging on my backpack. 

“Get off me,” I said. 

My pack dropped to the floor. I stooped to pick it up. She grabbed a 
hunk of my hair and yanked it. 

“Ow!” I screamed. 

She laughed and laughed. 

“That hurt!” I yelled, and shoved her—just as Mom stepped into the 
foyer. 

She rushed to Tara’s side. “Michael, don’t shove your sister. She’s only 
a little girl!” 

I stormed off to my room to think. 

No, I hadn ’t liked Tara better when she was three. She was as much of 
a brat as ever. 

She was born a brat, and she’d never grow out of it, I knew. She’d be a 
brat for the rest of her life, driving me crazy even when we’re old. 



If we ever get to be old, I thought with a shudder. We’ll never grow up 
at this rate. 

What am I going to do? I worried. I’ve slipped back in time four years! 
If I don’t do something fast, I’ll be a baby again. 

And then what? 

A cold shiver ran down my back. 

And then what? I asked myself. 

Will I disappear completely ? 



14 


I woke up in a panic every morning. 

What day was it? What year was it? 

I had no idea. 

I climbed out of bed—it seemed farther away from the floor than it 
used to—and padded across the hall to the bathroom. 

I stared in the mirror. How old was I? Younger than I’d been the day 
before, I knew that much. 

I went back to my room and began to get dressed. Mom had left my 
clothes for the day folded on a chair in my room. 

I examined the jeans I was supposed to wear. They had a picture of a 
cowboy on the back pocket. 

Oh, yeah, I remembered. These jeans. The cowboy jeans. 

Second grade. 

That means I must be seven years old now. 

I stepped into the pants, thinking, I can’t believe I have to wear these 
stupid jeans again. 

Then I unfolded the shirt Mom had picked out for me. 

My heart sank when I saw it: A cowboy shirt—with fringe and 
everything. 

This is so embarrassing, I thought. How could I have ever let Mom do 
this to me? 

Deep down I knew that I used to like these clothes. I probably picked 
them out myself. 

But I couldn’t stand to admit that I’d ever been so stupid. 

Downstairs, Tara was still in her pajamas, watching cartoons. She was 
now two. 

When she saw me pass through the living room, she held out her arms 
to me. “Kiss! Kiss!” she called. 

She wanted me to kiss her? That didn’t seem like Tara. 

But maybe the two-year-old Tara was still sweet and innocent. Maybe, 
at two, Tara was actually likable. 



“Kiss! Kiss!” she begged. 

“Give poor Tara a kiss,” Mom called from the kitchen. “You’re her big 
brother, Michael. She looks up to you.” 

I sighed. “Okay.” 

I leaned down to give Tara a kiss on the cheek. With one chubby index 
finger, she poked me in the eye. 

“Ow!” I shrieked. 

Tara laughed. 

Same old terrible Tara, I thought as I stumbled into the kitchen, one 
hand over my sore eye. 

She was born bad! 

This time, at school, I knew which classroom to go to. 

There sat all my old friends, Mona and everybody, younger than ever. 
I’d forgotten how dopey everybody used to look when we were little. 

I sat through another dull day of learning stuff I already knew. 
Subtraction. How to read books with really big print. Perfecting my capital 
L. 

At least it gave me lots of time to think. 

Every day I tried to figure out what to do. But I never came up with an 
answer. 

Then I remembered Dad telling us he’d been wanting the cuckoo clock 
for fifteen years. 

Fifteen years! That’s it! The clock must be at that antique store! 

I’ll go find the clock, I decided. I couldn’t wait for school to end that 

day. 

I figured if I could turn the cuckoo around, time would go forward 
again. I knew the dial that showed the year must be going backwards, too. 
All I had to do was reset the date on the clock to the right year, and I’d be 
twelve again. 

I missed being twelve. Seven-year-olds don’t get away with much. 
Someone’s always watching you. 

When the school day ended, I started down the block toward my 
house. I knew the crossing guard was watching me, making sure I’d get 
home safely. 

But at the second block I dashed around the corner to the bus stop. I 
hoped the crossing guard hadn’t seen me. 



I stood behind a tree, trying not to be seen. 

A few minutes later, a bus pulled over. The doors opened with a hiss. I 
stepped aboard. 

The bus driver eyed me strangely. “Aren’t you a little young to be 
riding the bus by yourself?” he asked me. 

“Mind your own business,” I replied. 

He looked startled, so I added, “I’m meeting Daddy at his office. 
Mommy said it was okay.” 

He nodded and let the doors slide shut. 

I started to put three quarters in the coin slot, but the driver stopped me 
after two. 

“Whoa, there, buddy,” he said, pressing the third quarter into my palm. 
“Fare’s only fifty cents. Keep this quarter for a phone call.” 

“Oh, yeah. Right.” I’d forgotten. They raised the bus fare to 75 cents 
when I was eleven. But now I was only seven. I put the quarter in my 
pocket. 

The bus pulled away from the curb and chugged downtown. 

I remembered hearing Dad say that Anthony’s Antiques and Stuff was 
across the street from his office. I got off the bus at Dad’s block. 

I hoped Dad wouldn’t see me. I knew I’d be in big trouble if he did. 

I wasn’t allowed to ride the bus by myself when I was seven. 

I hurried past Dad’s building and crossed the street. On the corner 
stood a construction site; just a pile of bricks and rubble, really. Further 
down the block I saw a black sign with Anthony’s Antiques and Stuff 
painted on it in gold letters. 

My heart began to pound. 

I’m almost there, I thought. Soon everything will be all right. 

I’ll just walk into the store and find the clock. Then, when no one’s 
looking, I’ll turn the cuckoo around and fix the year. 

I won’t have to worry about waking up tomorrow morning as a three- 
year-old or something. My life will go back to normal. 

Life will seem so easy, I told myself, when time is moving forward the 
way it’s supposed to. Even with Tara around! 

I gazed through the big plate-glass window of the shop. There it stood, 
right in the window. The clock. 

My palms began to sweat, I felt so excited. 



I hurried to the shop door and turned the handle. 

It wouldn’t move. I jiggled it harder. 

The door was locked. 

Then I noticed a sign, tucked in the bottom corner of the door. 
It said, CLOSED FOR VACATION. 



15 


I let out a howl of frustration. “NOOO!” I cried. Tears sprang to my eyes. 
“No! Not after all this.” 

I banged my head against the door. I couldn’t stand it. 

Closed for vacation. 

How could I have such terrible luck? 

How long was Anthony planning to be on vacation? I wondered. How 
long will the shop be closed? 

By the time it reopens, I could be a baby! 

I gritted my teeth and thought, there’s no way I’m letting that happen. 
No way! 

I’ve got to do something. Anything. 

I pressed my nose against the shop window. The cuckoo clock was 
standing there, two feet in front of me. 

And I couldn’t get to it. 

The window stood between me and that clock. 

The window... 

Normally, I would never think of doing what I decided to do at that 
moment. 

But I was desperate. I had to reach that clock. 

It really was a matter of life and death! 

I strolled down the block to the construction site, trying to look casual. 
Trying not to look like a kid who was planning to break a shop window. 

I stuffed my hands in the pockets of my cowboy jeans and whistled. I 
was sort of grateful to be wearing this stupid cowboy outfit after all. It 
made me look innocent. 

Who would suspect a seven-year-old in a cowboy suit of trying to 
break into an antique shop? 

I kicked around a little dirt at the construction site. Kicked a few rocks. 
Nobody seemed to be working there. 

Slowly I made my way over to a pile of bricks. I glanced around to see 
if anybody saw me. 



The coast was clear. 

I picked up a brick and hefted it in my hand. It was very heavy. It 
wouldn’t be easy for me, in my little second-grade body, to throw it far. 

But I didn’t have to throw it far. Just through the window. 

I tried stuffing the brick in my pants pocket, but it was too big. So I 
carried it in both hands back to the shop. 

I tried to look as if it were perfectly normal for a boy to be carrying a 
brick down the street. 

A few adults quickly passed by. No one gave me a second glance. 

I stood in front of the shiny plate-glass window, weighing the brick in 
my hand. I wondered if a burglar alarm would go off when I broke the 
window. 

Would I be arrested? 

Maybe it wouldn’t matter. If I made time go to the present, I’d escape 
the police. 

Be brave, I told myself. Go for it! 

With both hands, I raised the brick over my head... 

.. .and someone grabbed me from behind. 



16 


“Help!” I shouted. I spun around. “Dad!” 

“Michael, what are you doing here?” Dad demanded. “Are you by 
yourself?” 

I let the brick fall to the sidewalk. He didn’t seem to see it. 

“I—I wanted to surprise you,” I lied. “I wanted to come visit you after 
school.” 

He stared at me as if he didn’t quite understand. So I added, for good 
measure, “I missed you, Daddy.” 

He smiled. “You missed me?” He was touched. I could tell. 

“How did you get here?” he asked. “On the bus?” 

I nodded. 

“You know you’re not allowed to ride the bus by yourself,” he said. 
But he didn’t sound angry. I knew that line about missing him would soften 
him up. 

Meanwhile, I still had the same major problem—getting my hands on 
the cuckoo clock. 

Could Dad help me? Would he? I was willing to try anything. “Dad,” I 
said, “that clock—” 

Dad put his arm around me. “Isn’t it a beauty? I’ve been admiring it 
for years.” 

“Dad, I’ve got to get to the clock,” I insisted. “It’s very, very 
important! Do you know when the store will open again? We’ve got to get 
that clock somehow!” 

Dad misunderstood me. He patted me on the head and said, “I know 
how you feel, Michael. I wish I could have the clock right now. But I can’t 
afford it. Maybe some day...” 

He pulled me away from the shop. “Come on—let’s go home. I 
wonder what’s for supper tonight?” 

I didn’t say another word all the way home in the car. All I could think 
about was the clock—and what would happen to me next. 

How old will I be when I wake up tomorrow? I wondered. 

Or how young? 



17 


When I opened my eyes the next morning, everything had changed. 

The walls were painted baby blue. The bedspread and the curtains 
matched. The material was printed with bouncing kangaroos. On one wall 
hung a needlepoint picture of a cow. 

It wasn’t my room, but it looked familiar. 

Then I felt a lump in the bed. I reached under the kangaroo covers and 
pulled out Harold, my old teddy bear. 

I slowly understood. I was back in my old bedroom. 

How had I ended up there? It was Tara’s room now. 

I jumped out of bed. I was wearing Smurf pajamas. 

I swear I don’t remember ever liking Smurfs that much. 

I ran to the bathroom to look in the mirror. 

How old was I now? 

I couldn’t tell. I had to stand on the toilet seat to see my face. 

A bad sign. 

Yikes. I looked about five years old! 

I hopped off the toilet seat and hurried downstairs. 

“Hello, Mikey,” Mom said, squeezing me and giving me a big kiss. 

“Hi, Mommy,” I said. I couldn’t believe how babyish my voice 
sounded. 

Dad sat at the kitchen table, drinking coffee. He put down his mug and 
held out his arms. “Come give Daddy a good morning kiss,” he said. 

I sighed and forced myself to run into his arms and kiss him on the 
cheek. I’d forgotten how many stupid things little kids have to put up with. 

I ran out of the kitchen on my little five-year-old legs, through the 
living room, into the den, and back to the kitchen. Something was missing. 

No, someone was missing. 

Tara. 

“Sit still for a minute, sweetie,” Mom said, scooping me up and 
plopping me into a chair. “Want some cereal?” 

“Where’s Tara?” I demanded. 



“Who?” Mom replied. 

“Tara,” I repeated. 

Mom glanced at Dad. Dad shrugged. 

“You know,” I persisted. “My little sister.” 

Mom smiled. “Oh, Tara,” she said, seeming to understand at last. 

She glanced at Dad and mouthed, “Invisible friend.” 

“Huh?” Dad said out loud. “He has an invisible friend?” 

Mom frowned at him and gave me a bowl of cereal. “What does your 
friend Tara look like, Mikey?” 

I didn’t answer her. I was too shocked to speak. 

They don’t know who I’m talking about! I realized. 

Tara doesn’t exist. She hasn’t been born yet! 

For a brief moment, I felt a thrill. No Tara! I could go through this 
whole day without ever seeing, hearing, or smelling Tara the Terrible! How 
totally awesome! 

But then the real meaning of this sank in. 

One Webster kid had disappeared. 

I was next. 

After I’d finished my cereal, Mom took me upstairs to get dressed. She put 
on my shirt and pants and socks and shoes. She didn’t tie the shoes, though. 

“Okay, Mikey,” she said. “Let’s practice tying your shoes. Remember 
how we did it yesterday?” 

She took my shoelaces in her fingers and, as she tied them, chanted, 
“The bunny hops around the tree and ducks under the bush. Remember?” 

She sat back to watch me try to tie my other shoe. I could tell by the 
look on her face she didn’t expect me to get very far. 

I bent over and easily tied the shoe. I didn’t have time to fool around 
with this stuff. 

Mom stared at me in amazement. 

“Come on, Mom, let’s get going,” I said, straightening up. 

“Mikey!” Mom cried. “You did it! You tied your shoe for the first 
time!” She grabbed me and hugged me hard. “Wait till I tell Daddy!” 

I followed her downstairs, rolling my eyes. 

So I tied my shoe. Big deal! 

“Honey!” Mom called. “Mikey tied his shoe—all by himself!” 



“Hey!” Dad cried happily. He held up one hand so I could slap him 
five. “That’s my big boy!” 

This time I saw him mouth to Mom: “Took him long enough!” 

I was too worried to be insulted. 

Mom walked me to kindergarten. She told my teacher that I’d learned 
to tie my shoe. Big excitement all around. 

I had to sit around that stupid kindergarten all morning, finger¬ 
painting, and singing the ABC song. 

I knew I had to get back to that antique store. It was all I could think 
about. 

I’ve got to change that cuckoo clock, I thought desperately. Who 
knows? Tomorrow I might not know how to walk. 

But how would I get there? It had been hard enough to get downtown 
as a second-grader. As a kindergartner, it would be nearly impossible. 

And, besides, even if I could get on the bus without anybody asking 
questions, I didn’t have any money with me. 

I glanced at the teacher’s purse. Maybe I could steal a couple of 
quarters from her. She’d probably never know. 

But if she caught me, I’d be in really big trouble. And I had enough 
trouble now. 

I decided to sneak on to the bus somehow. I knew I could find a way. 

When the kindergarten torture was finally over for the day, I raced out 
of the building to catch the bus— 

—and bumped smack into Mom. 

“Hi, Mikey,” she said. “Did you have a nice day?” 

I forgot that she picked me up every day from kindergarten. 

She took my hand in her iron grip. There was no escape. 



18 


At least I’m here, I thought when I woke up the next morning. At least I’m 
still alive. 

But I’m four years old. 

Time is running out. 

Mom waltzed into my room, singing, “Good morning to you, good 
morning to you, good morning dear Mikey, good morning to you! Ready 
for nursery school?” 

Yuck. Nursery school. 

Things kept getting worse and worse. 

I couldn’t take it anymore. Mom dropped me off at nursery school 
with a kiss and her usual, “Have a nice day, Mikey!” 

I stalked to the nearest corner and sat. I watched the other little kids 
play. I refused to do anything. No singing. No painting. No sandbox. No 
games for me. 

“Michael, what’s the matter with you today?” the teacher, Ms. Sarton, 
asked. “Don’t you feel well?” 

“I feel okay,” I told her. 

“Well, then, why aren’t you playing?” She studied me for a minute, 
then added, “I think you need to play.” 

Without asking my permission or anything, she picked me up, carried 
me outside, and dumped me in the sandbox. 

“Mona will play with you,” she said brightly. 

Mona was very cute when she was four. Why didn’t I remember that? 

Mona didn’t say anything to me. She concentrated on the sand igloo 
she was building—at least I think it was supposed to be an igloo. It was 
round, anyway. I started to say hi to her, but suddenly felt shy. 

Then I caught myself. Why should I feel bashful with a four-year-old 

girl? 

Anyway, I reasoned, she hasn’t seen me in my underwear yet. That 
won’t happen for another eight years. 

“Hi, Mona,” I said. I cringed when I heard the babyish nursery school 
voice that came out of my mouth. But everyone else seemed to be used to 



it. 

Mona turned up her nose. “Eeew,” she sniffed. “A boy. I hate boys.” 

“Well,” I squeaked in my little boy voice, “if that’s the way you feel, 
forget I said anything.” 

Mona stared at me now, as if she didn’t quite understand what I had 

said. 

“You’re stupid,” she said. 

I shrugged and began to draw swirls in the sand with my chubby little 
finger. Mona dug a moat around her sand igloo. Then she stood up. “Don’t 
let anybody smash my sand castle,” she ordered. 

So it wasn’t an igloo. Guess I was wrong. 

“Okay,” I agreed. 

She toddled away. A few minutes later she returned, carrying a bucket. 

She carefully poured a little water into her sand castle moat. She 
dumped the rest on my head. 

“Stupid boy!” she squealed, running away. 

I rose and shook my wet head like a dog. I felt a strange urge to burst 
into tears and run to the teacher for help, but I fought it. 

Mona stood a few yards away from me, ready to run. “Nyah nyah!” 
she taunted. “Come and get me, Mikey!” 

I pushed my wet hair out of my face and stared at Mona. 

“You can’t catch me!” she called. 

What could I do? I had to chase after her. 

I began to run. Mona screamed and raced to a tree by the playground 
fence. Another girl stood there. Was that Ceecee? 

She wore thick glasses with pink rims, and underneath, a pink 
eyepatch. 

I’d forgotten about that eyepatch. She’d had to wear it until halfway 
through first grade. 

Mona screamed again and clutched at Ceecee. Ceecee clutched her 
back and screamed, too. 

I stopped in front of the tree. “Don’t worry. I won’t hurt you,” I 
assured them. 

“Yes you will!” Mona squealed. “Help!” 

I sat down on the grass to prove I didn’t want to hurt them. 

“He’s hurting us! He’s hurting us!” the girls shouted. They unclutched 



their hands and jumped on top of me. 

“Ow!” I cried. 

“Hold his arms!” Mona ordered. Ceecee obeyed. Mona started tickling 
me under the arms. 

“Stop it!” I begged. It was torture. “Stop it!” 

“No!” Mona cried. “That’s what you get for trying to catch us!” 

“I... didn’t...” I had trouble getting the words out while she tickled 
me. “I didn’t... try to...” 

“Yes you did!” Mona insisted. 

I’d forgotten that Mona used to be so bossy. It made me think twice. If 
I ever make it back to my real age, I thought, maybe I won’t like Mona so 
much anymore. 

“Please stop,” I begged again. 

“I’ll stop,” Mona said. “But only if you promise something.” 

“What?” 

“You have to climb that tree.” She pointed to the tree by the fence. 
“Okay?” 

I stared at the tree. Climbing it wouldn’t be such a big deal. “Okay,” I 
agreed. “Just get off me!” 

Mona stood up. Ceecee let go of my arms. 

I climbed to my feet and brushed the grass off my pants. 

“You’re scared,” Mona taunted. 

“I am not!” I replied. What a brat! She was almost as bad as Tara! 

Now Mona and Ceecee chanted, “Mikey is scared. Mikey is scared.” 

I ignored them. I grabbed the lowest branch of the tree and hauled 
myself up. It was harder than I thought it would be. My four-year-old body 
wasn’t very athletic. 

“Mikey is scared. Mikey is scared.” 

“Shut up!” I yelled down at them. “Can’t you see that I’m climbing the 
stupid tree? It doesn’t make sense to tease me about being scared.” 

They both gave me that blank look Mona had given me before. As if 
they didn’t understand what I was saying. 

“Mikey is scared,” they chanted again. 

I sighed and kept climbing. My hands were so small, it was hard to 
grip the branches. One of my feet slipped. 

Then a terrible thought popped into my head. 



Wait a minute. 

I shouldn’t be doing this. 

Isn’t nursery school the year I broke my arm? 
YEEEEOOOOOOWWWWW! 



19 


Morning again. 

I yawned and opened my eyes. I shook my left arm, the one I broke 
climbing that stupid tree the day before. 

The arm felt fine. Perfectly normal. Completely healed. 

I must have gone back in time again, I thought. That’s the good part 
about this messed-up time thing: I didn’t have to wait for my arm to heal. 

I wondered how far back I went. 

The sun poured in through the window of Tara’s—or my—room. It 
cast a weird shadow across my face: a striped shadow. 

I tried to roll out of bed. My body slammed against something. 

What was that? I rolled back to look. 

Bars! 

I was surrounded by bars! Was I in jail? 

I tried to sit up so I could see better. It wasn’t as easy as usual. My 
stomach muscles seemed to have grown weak. 

At last I managed to sit up and look around. 

I wasn’t in jail. I was in a crib! 

Crumpled up beside me was my old yellow blankie with the 
embroidered duck on it. I sat beside a small pile of stuffed animals. I was 
wearing a tiny white undershirt, and— 

Oh, no. 

I shut my eyes in horror. 

It can’t be. Please don’t let it be true! I prayed. 

I opened my eyes and checked to see if my prayer had come true. 

It hadn’t. 

I was wearing diapers. 

Diapers! 

How young am I now? How far back in time did I go? I wondered. 

“Are you awake, Mikey?” 

Mom came into the room. She looked pretty young. I didn’t remember 
ever seeing her this young before. 



“Did you get lots of sleep, sweetie pie?” Mom asked. She clearly 
expected no answer from me. Instead, she shoved a bottle of juice into my 
mouth. 

Yuck! A bottle! 

I pulled it out of my mouth and clumsily threw it down. 

Mom picked it up. “No, no,” she said patiently. “Bad little Mikey. 
Drink your bottle now. Come on.” 

She slid it back into my mouth. I was thirsty, so I drank the juice. 
Drinking from a bottle wasn’t that bad, once you got used to it. 

Mom left the room. I let the bottle drop. 

I had to know how old I was. I had to find out how much time I had 

left. 

I grabbed the bars of the crib and pulled myself to my feet. 

Okay, I thought. I can stand. 

I took a step. I couldn’t control my leg muscles very well. I toddled 
around the crib. 

I can walk, I realized. Unsteadily, but at least I can walk. 

I must be about one year old! 

I fell just then and banged my head against the side of the crib. Tears 
welled in my eyes. I started wailing, bawling. 

Mom ran into the room. “What’s the matter, Mikey? What happened?” 
She picked me up and started patting me on the back. 

I couldn’t stop crying. It was really embarrassing. 

What am I going to do? I thought desperately. In one night, I went 
back in time three years! 

I’m only one year old now. How old will I be tomorrow? 

A little shiver ran down my tiny spine. 

I’ve got to find a way to make time go forward again—today! I told 
myself. 

But what can I do? 

I’m not even in nursery school anymore. 

I’m a baby! 



20 


Mom said we were going out. She wanted to dress me. Then she uttered the 
dreaded words. 

“I bet I know what’s bothering you, Mikey. You probably need your 
diaper changed.” 

“No!” I cried. “No!” 

“Oh, yes you do, Mikey. Come on...” 

I don’t like to think about what happened after that. I’d rather block it 
out of my memory. 

I’m sure you understand. 

When the worst was over, Mom plopped me down in a playpen—more 
bars—while she bustled around the house. 

I shook a rattle. I batted at a mobile hanging over my head. I watched 
it spin around. 

I pressed buttons on a plastic toy. Different noises came out when I 
pressed different buttons. A squeak. A honk. A moo. 

I was bored out of my mind. 

Then Mom picked me up again. She bundled me into a warm sweater 
and a dopey little knit cap. Baby blue. 

“Want to see Daddy?” she cooed at me. “Want to see Daddy and go 
shopping?” 

“Da-da,” I replied. 

I’d planned to say, “If you don’t take me to Anthony’s Antiques, I’ll 
throw myself out of my crib and crack my head open.” 

But I couldn’t talk. It was so frustrating! 

Mom carried me out to the car. She strapped me into a baby seat in the 
back. I tried to say, “Not so tight, Mom!” It came out, “No no no no no!” 

“Don’t give me a hard time now, Mikey,” Mom said sharply. “I know 
you don’t like your car seat, but it’s the law.” She gave the strap an extra 
tug. 

Then she drove into town. 

At least there’s a chance, I thought. If we’re going to meet Dad, we’ll 
be near the antique store. Maybe, just maybe. 



Mom parked the car outside Dad’s office building. She unstrapped me 
from the car seat. 

I could move again. But not for long. She pulled a stroller out of the 
trunk, unfolded it, and strapped me in. 

Being a baby really is like being a prisoner, I thought as she wheeled 
me across the sidewalk. I never realized how awful it is! 

It was lunchtime. A stream of workers flowed out of the office 
building. Dad appeared and gave Mom a kiss. 

He squatted down to tickle me under the chin. “There’s my little boy!” 
he said. 

“Can you say hi to your daddy?” Mom prompted me. 

“Hi, Da-da,” I gurgled. 

“Hi, Mikey,” Dad said fondly. But when he stood up, he spoke quietly 
to Mom, as if I couldn’t hear. “Shouldn’t he being saying more words by 
now, honey? Ted Jackson’s kid is Mikey’s age, and he can say whole 
sentences. He can say ‘lightbulb’, and ‘kitchen’, and ‘I want my teddy 
bear.’” 

“Don’t start that again,” Mom whispered angrily. “Mikey is not slow.” 

I squirmed in my stroller, fuming. Slow! Who said I was slow? 

“I didn’t say he was slow, honey,” Dad went on. “I only said—” 

“Yes you did,” Mom insisted. “Yes you did! The other night, when he 
stuffed those peas up his nose, you said you thought we should have him 
tested!” 

I stuffed peas up my nose? I shuddered. 

Sure, stuffing peas up your nose is stupid. But I was only a baby. 
Wasn’t Dad getting carried away? 

I thought so. 

I wished I could tell them I would turn out all right—at least up to the 
age of twelve. I mean, I’m no genius, but I get mostly A’s and B’s. 

“Can we discuss this later?” Dad said. “I’ve only got an hour for 
lunch. If we’re going to find a dining room table, we’d better get moving.” 

“You brought it up,” Mom sniffed. She wheeled the stroller smartly 
around and began to cross the street. Dad followed us. 

I let my eyes rove along the storefronts across the street. An apartment 
building. A pawnshop. A coffee shop. 

Then I found what I was looking for: Anthony’s Antiques and Stuff. 



My heart leaped. The store still existed! I kept my eyes glued to that 

sign. 

Please take me in there, Mom, I silently prayed. Please please please! 
Mom steered me down the street. Past the apartment building. Past the 
pawnshop. Past the coffee shop. 

We stopped in front of Anthony’s. Dad stood in front of the window, 
hands in his pockets, gazing through the glass. Mom and I pulled up beside 
him. 

I couldn’t believe it. Finally, after all this time—some good luck! 

I stared through the window, searching for it. 

The clock. 

The window display was set up like an old-fashioned living room. My 
eyes roamed over the furniture: a wooden bookcase, a fringed table lamp, a 
Persian rug, an overstuffed armchair, and a clock... a table clock. Not the 
cuckoo clock. 

Not the right clock. 

My heart sank back to its normal low spot in my chest. 

It figures, I thought. Here I am, at the antique store, at last. 

And the clock isn’t here. 



21 


I felt like crying. 

I could have cried, too. Easily. 

After all, I was a baby. People expected me to cry. 

But I didn’t. Even though I looked like a baby, I was a twelve-year-old 
inside. I still had my pride. 

Dad stepped to the door and held it open for Mom and me. Mom 
pushed me inside. I sat strapped into the stroller. 

The shop was jammed with old furniture. A chubby man in his forties 
strolled down the aisle toward us. 

Behind him, down at the end of the aisle, in a corner at the back of the 
shop, I saw it. The clock. The clock. 

A squeal of excitement popped out of me. I began to rock in my 
stroller. I was so close! 

“May I help you?” the man asked Mom and Dad. 

“We’re looking for a dining room table,” Mom told him. 

I had to get out of that stroller. I had to get to that clock. 

I rocked harder, but it was no good. I was strapped in. “Let me out of 
this thing!” I shouted. 

Mom and Dad turned to look at me. “What’s he saying?” Dad asked. 

“It sounded like 'La ma la ma’,” the shopkeeper suggested. 

I rocked harder than ever and screamed. 

“He hates his stroller,” Mom explained. She leaned down and 
unbuckled the straps. “I’ll hold him for a few minutes. Then he’ll quiet 
down.” 

I waited until she held me in her arms. Then I screamed again and 
wriggled as hard as I could. 

Dad’s face reddened. “Michael, what is wrong with you?” 

“Down! Down!” I yelled. 

“All right,” Mom muttered, setting me down on the floor. “Now please 
stop screaming.” 

I quieted down immediately. I tested my wobbly, chubby little legs. 



They wouldn’t get me far, but they were all I had to work with. 

“Keep an eye on him,” the shopkeeper warned. “A lot of this stuff is 
breakable.” 

Mom grabbed my hand. “Come on, Mikey. Let’s go look at some 
tables.” 

She tried to lead me to a corner of the shop where several wooden 
tables stood. I whined and squirmed, hoping to get away. Her grip was too 
tight. 

“Mikey, shhh,” she said. 

I let her drag me to the tables. I glanced up at the cuckoo clock. It was 
almost noon. 

At noon, I knew, the cuckoo would pop out. It was my only chance to 
grab the bird and turn it around. 

I tugged on Mom’s hand. She tightened her grip. 

“What do you think of this one, honey?” Dad asked her, rubbing his 
hand along a dark wood table. 

“I think that wood’s too dark for our chairs, Herman,” Mom said. 
Another table caught her eye. As she moved toward it, I tried to slip my 
hand out of hers. No go. 

I toddled after her to the second table. I shot another glance at the 
clock. The minute hand moved. 

Two minutes to twelve. 

“We can’t be too picky, honey,” Dad said. “The Bergers are coming 
over Saturday night—two days from now—for a dinner party. We can’t 
have a dinner party without a dining room table!” 

“I know that, dear. But there’s no point in buying a table we don’t 
like.” 

Dad’s voice began to rise. Mom’s mouth got that hard, set look to it. 

Aha. A fight. This was my chance. 

Dad was shouting. “Why don’t we just spread a blanket out on the 
floor and make them eat there? We’ll call it a picnic!” 

Mom finally relaxed her grip on my hand. 

I slipped away and toddled as fast as I could toward the clock. 

The clock’s minute hand moved again. 

I toddled faster. 

I heard my parents shouting at each other. “I won’t buy an ugly table, 



and that’s that!” Mom cried. 

Please don’t let them notice me, I prayed. Not yet. 

I reached the cuckoo clock at last. I stood in front of it and stared up at 
the clock. 

The cuckoo’s window was far above me, out of reach. 

The minute hand clicked again. The clock’s gong sounded. 

The cuckoo’s window slid open. The cuckoo popped out. 

It cuckooed once. 

It cuckooed twice. 

I stared up at it, helpless. 

A twelve-year-old boy trapped in a baby’s body. 

I stared grimly up at the clock. 

Somehow, I had to reach that cuckoo. 

Somehow, I had to turn it around. 



22 


Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 

Three, four. 

I knew that once it reached twelve, I was doomed. 

The cuckoo bird would disappear. 

And so would my last chance to save myself. 

In a day or so, I would disappear. Disappear forever. 

Frantic, I glanced around for a ladder, a stool, anything. 

The closest thing was a chair. 

I toddled over to the chair and pushed it toward the clock. It moved 
about an inch. 

I leaned, putting all my weight into it. I figured I weighed about 
twenty pounds. 

But it was enough. The chair began to slide across the floor. 

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Five, six. 

I shoved the chair up against the clock. The seat of the chair came up 
to my chin. 

I tried to pull myself up onto the seat. My arms were too weak. 

I planted a baby sneaker against the chair leg. I boosted myself up. I 
grabbed a spindle at the back of the chair and heaved my body onto the 
seat. 

I made it! 

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Seven, eight. 

I got to my knees. I got to my feet. 

I reached up to grab the cuckoo. I stretched as tall as I could. 

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Nine, ten. 

Reaching, reaching. 

Then I heard the shopkeeper shout, “Somebody grab that baby!” 



23 


I heard pounding footsteps. 

They were running to get me. 

I strained to reach the cuckoo. Just another inch... 

Cuckoo! 

Eleven. 

Mom grabbed me. She lifted me up. 

For one second, the cuckoo flashed within my reach. 

I grasped it and turned the head around. 

Cuckoo! 

Twelve. 

The cuckoo slid back into the clock, facing the right way. 

Forward. 

I wriggled out of Mom’s arms, landing on the chair. 

“Mikey, what’s gotten into you?” she cried. She tried to grab me again. 
I dodged her. I reached around to the side of the clock. 

I saw the little dial that told the year. I felt for the button that 
controlled it. I could just reach it, standing on the chair. 

I slammed my hand on the button, carefully watching the years whiz 

by. 

I heard the shopkeeper yelling, “Get that baby away from my clock!” 
Mom grabbed me again, but I screamed. I screamed so loudly, it 
startled her. She let her hands drop. 

“Mikey, let go of that!” Dad ordered. 

I took my hand off the button. The dial showed the right year. The 
present year. The year I turned twelve. 

Mom made another grab for me. This time I let her pick me up. 

It doesn’t matter what happens now, I thought. Either the clock will 
work, and I’ll go back to being twelve again... 

.. .or else it won’t work. And then what? 

Then I’ll disappear. Vanish in time. Forever. 

I waited. 



“I’m so sorry,” Dad said to the shopkeeper. “I hope the baby didn’t 
damage the clock.” 

The muscles in my neck tensed. 

Nothing was happening. Nothing. 

I waited another minute. 

The shopkeeper inspected the clock. “Everything seems okay,” he told 
Dad. “But he changed the year. I’ll have to change it back.” 

“NO!” I wailed. “No! Don’t!” 

“That boy could use a little discipline, if you ask me,” the shopkeeper 

said. 

He reached his hand around the side of the clock and started to set 
back the year. 



24 


“Nooo!” I wailed. “Nooo!” 

That’s it, I realized. I’m doomed. I’m a goner. 

But the shopkeeper never touched the button. 

A bright white light flashed. I felt dizzy, stunned. I blinked. And 
blinked again. 

Several seconds passed before I could see anything. 

I felt cool, damp air. I smelled a musty odor. A garage smell. 

“Michael? Do you like it?” Dad’s voice. 

I blinked. My eyes adjusted. I saw Dad and Mom. Looking older. 
Looking normal. 

We were standing in the garage. Dad was holding a shiny new 21- 
speed bike. 

Mom frowned. “Michael, are you feeling all right?” 

They were giving me the bike. It was my birthday! 

The clock worked! I’d brought myself back to the present! 

Almost to the present. Up to my twelfth birthday. 

Close enough. 

I felt so happy, I thought I’d explode. 

I threw myself at Mom and hugged her hard. Then I hugged Dad. 

“Wow,” Dad gushed. “I guess you really do like the bike!” 

I grinned. “I love it!” I exclaimed. “I love everything! I love the whole 
world!” 

Mainly, I loved being twelve again. I could walk! I could talk! I could 
ride the bus by myself! 

Whoa! Wait a minute, I thought. It’s my birthday. 

Don’t tell me I have to live through it again. 

I tensed my shoulders and steeled myself for the horrible day to come. 

It’s worth it, I told myself. It’s worth it if it means time will go forward 
again, the way it’s supposed to. 

I knew too well what would happen next. 

Tara. 



She’d try to get on my bike. The bike would fall over and get 
scratched. 

Okay, Tara, I thought. I’m ready. Come and do your worst. 

I waited. 

Tara didn’t come. 

In fact, she didn’t seem to be around at all. 

She wasn’t in the garage. No sign of her. 

Mom and Dad oohed and ahhed over the bike. They didn’t act as if 
anything was wrong. Or anyone was missing. 

“Where’s Tara?” I asked them. 

They looked up. 

“Who?” They stared at me. 

“Did you invite her to your party?” Mom asked. “I don’t remember 
sending an invitation to a Tara.” 

Dad grinned at me. “Tara? Is that some girl you have a crush on, 
Michael?” 

“No,” I answered, turning red. 

It was as if they’d never heard of Tara. Never heard of their own 
daughter. 

“You’d better go upstairs and get ready for your party, Michael,” Mom 
suggested. “The kids will be here soon.” 

“Okay.” I stumbled into the house, dazed. 

“Tara?” I called. 

Silence. 

Could she be hiding somewhere? 

I searched through the house. Then I checked her room. I threw open 
the door. I expected to see a messy, all-pink girl’s room with a white canopy 
bed. 

Instead, I saw two twin beds, neatly made with plaid covers. A chair. 
An empty closet. No personal stuff. 

Not Tara’s room. 

A guest room. 

Wow. I was amazed. 

No Tara. Tara doesn’t exist. 

How did that happen? 

I wandered into the den, looking for the cuckoo clock. 



It wasn’t there. 

For a second, I felt a shock of fear. Then I calmed down. 

Oh, yeah, I remembered. We don’t have the clock yet. Not on my 
birthday. Dad bought it a couple of days later. 

But I still didn’t understand. What had happened to my little sister? 
Where was Tara? 

My friends arrived for the party. We played CDs and ate tortilla chips. 
Ceecee pulled me into a corner and whispered that Mona had a crush on 
me. 

Wow. I glanced at Mona. She turned a little pink and glanced away, 
shyly. 

Tara wasn’t there to embarrass me. It made a big difference. 

My friends all brought presents. I actually opened them myself. No 
Tara to open my presents before I get to them. 

At cake time, I carried the cake into the dining room and set it in the 
middle of the table. No problem. I didn’t fall and make a fool out of myself. 
Because Tara wasn’t there to trip me. 

It was the greatest birthday party I’d ever had. It was probably the 
greatest day I’d ever lived—because Tara wasn’t there to ruin it. 

I could get used to this, I thought. 

A few days later, the cuckoo clock was delivered to our house. 

“Isn’t it great?” Dad gushed, as he had the first time. “Anthony sold 
me the clock cheap. He said he’d discovered a tiny flaw on it.” 

The flaw. I’d almost forgotten about it. 

We still didn’t know what it was. But I couldn’t help wondering if it 
had something to do with Tara’s disappearance. 

Maybe the clock didn’t work perfectly in some way? Maybe it 
somehow left Tara behind? 

I hardly dared to touch the clock. I didn’t want to set off any more 
weird time trips. 

But I had to know what had happened. 

I carefully studied the face of the clock again, and all the decorations. 
Then I stared at the dial that showed the year. 

It was properly set at the current year. 

Without really thinking about it, I scanned twelve places down the dial 



to find the year I was born. 

There it was. 

Then I scanned my eyes back up to the dial. 
1992.1993.1994.1995.1997... 

Wait a second. 

Didn’t I just skip a year? 

I checked the dates again. 

Nineteen ninety-six was missing. There was no 1996 on the dial. 

And 1996 was the year Tara was born! 

“Dad!” I cried. “I found the flaw! Look—there’s a year missing on the 
dial.” 

Dad patted me on the back. “Good job, son! Wow, isn’t that funny?” 

To him it was just a funny mistake. 

He had no idea his daughter had never been born. 

I suppose there’s some way to go back in time and get her. 

I guess I probably ought to do that. 

And I will. 

Really. 

One of these days. 

Maybe.
