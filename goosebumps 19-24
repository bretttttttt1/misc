DEEP TROUBLE 
Goosebumps -19 
R.L. Stine

There I was, two hundred feet under the sea. 

I was on the hunt of my life. The hunt for the Great White Stingray. 

That’s what they called him at Coast Guard Headquarters. But, me, I called 
him Joe. 

The giant stingray had already stung ten swimmers. People were afraid to 
step into the water. Panic spread all up and down the coast. 

That’s why they sent for me. 

William Deep, Jr., of Baltimore, Maryland. 

Yes, William Deep, Jr., world-famous twelve-year-old undersea explorer. 
Solver of scary ocean problems. 

I captured the Great White Shark that terrorized Myrtle Beach. I proved he 
wasn’t so great! 

I fought the giant octopus that ate the entire California Championship 
Surfing Team. 

I unplugged the electric eel that sent shock waves all over Miami. 

But now I faced the fight of my life. Joe, the Great White Stingray. 

Somewhere down deep under the sea, he lurked. 

I had everything I needed: scuba suit, flippers, mask, oxygen tank, and 
poison-dart gun. 

Wait—did something move? Just behind that giant clam? 

I raised my dart gun and waited for an attack. 

Then, suddenly, my mask clouded. I couldn’t breathe. 

I strained for breath. No air came. 

My oxygen tank! Someone must have tampered with it! 

There was no time to lose. Two hundred feet down—and no air! I had to 
surface—fast! 

I kicked my legs, desperately trying to pull myself to the surface. 

Holding my breath. My lungs about to burst. I was losing strength, getting 
dizzy. 

Would I make it? Or would I die right here, deep under the ocean, Joe the 
Stingray’s dinner? 



Panic swept over me like an ocean tide. I searched through the fogged mask 
for my diving partner. Where was she when I needed her? 

Finally, I spotted her swimming up at the surface, near the boat. 

Help me! Save me! No air! I tried to tell her, waving my arms like a 
maniac. 

Finally she noticed me. She swam toward me and dragged my dazed and 
limp body to the surface. 

I ripped off my mask and sucked in mouthfuls of air. 

“What’s your problem, Aqua Man?” she cried. “Did a jellyfish sting you?” 

My diving partner is very brave. She laughs in the face of danger. 

I struggled to catch my breath. “No air. Someone—cut off—tank—” 

Then everything went black.

My diving partner shoved my head back under the water. I opened my eyes and 
came up sputtering. 

“Get real, Billy,” she said. “Can’t you snorkel without acting like a total 
jerk?” 

I sighed. She was no fun. 

My “diving partner” was really just my bratty sister, Sheena. I was only 
pretending to be William Deep, Jr., undersea explorer. 

But would it kill Sheena to go along with it just once? 

My name actually is William Deep, Jr., but everybody calls me Billy. I’m 
twelve—I think I mentioned that already. 

Sheena is ten. She looks like me. We both have straight black hair, but mine 
is short and hers goes down to her shoulders. We’re both skinny, with knobby 
knees and elbows, and long, narrow feet. We both have dark blue eyes and thick, 
dark eyebrows. 

Other than that, we’re not alike at all. 

Sheena has no imagination. She was never afraid of monsters in her closet 
when she was little. She didn’t believe in Santa Claus or the tooth fairy, either. 
She loves to say, “There’s no such thing.” 

I dove underwater and pinched Sheena’s leg. Attack of the Giant Lobster 
Man! 

“Stop it!” she screamed. She kicked me in the shoulder. I came up for air. 

“Hey, you two,” my uncle said. “Be careful down there.” 

My uncle stood on the deck of his sea lab boat, the Cassandra. He peered 
down at Sheena and me snorkeling nearby. 

My uncle’s name is George Deep, but everybody calls him Dr. D. Even my 
dad, who is his brother, calls him Dr. D. Maybe that’s because he looks just the 
way a scientist should. 

Dr. D. is short, thin, wears glasses and a very serious, thoughtful 
expression. He has curly brown hair and a bald spot at the back of his head. 
Anyone who saw him would say, “I bet you’re a scientist.” 

Sheena and I were visiting Dr. D. on the Cassandra. Every year our parents 
let us spend our summer vacation with Dr. D. It sure beats hanging out at home. 



This summer, we were anchored just off a tiny island called Ilandra, in the 
Caribbean Sea. 

Dr. D. is a marine biologist. He specializes in tropical marine life. He 
studies the habits of tropical fish and looks for new kinds of ocean plants and 
fish that haven’t been discovered yet. 

The Cassandra is a big and sturdy boat. It is about fifty feet long. Dr. D. 
uses most of the space for labs and research rooms. Up on deck is a cockpit, 
where he steers the boat. He keeps a dinghy tied to the starboard, or right side of 
the deck, and a huge glass tank on the port, or left side. 

Sometimes Dr. D. catches very big fish and keeps them temporarily in the 
glass tank—usually just long enough to tag the fish for research, or care for them 
if they are sick or injured. 

The rest of the deck is open space, good for playing catch or sunbathing. 

Dr. D.’s research takes him all over the world. He isn’t married and doesn’t 
have any kids. He says he’s too busy staring at fish. 

But he likes kids. That’s why he invites me and Sheena to visit him every 
summer. 

“Stick close together, kids,” Dr. D. said. “And don’t swim off too far. 
Especially you, Billy.” 

He narrowed his eyes at me. That’s his “I mean it” look. He never narrows 
his eyes at Sheena. 

“There’ve been reports of some shark sightings in the area,” he said. 

“Sharks! Wow!” I cried. 

Dr. D. frowned at me. “Billy,” he said. “This is serious. Don’t leave the 
boat. And don’t go near the reef.” 

I knew he was going to say that. 

Clamshell Reef is a long, red coral reef just a few hundred yards away from 
where we were anchored. I’d been dying to explore it ever since we got there. 

“Don’t worry about me, Dr. D.,” I called up to him. “I won’t get into 
trouble.” 

Sheena muttered under her breath, “Yeah, right.” 

I reached out to give her another lobster pinch, but she dove under water. 

“Good,” said Dr. D. “Now don’t forget—if you see a shark fin, try not to 
splash around a lot. Movement will attract it. Just slowly, steadily return to the 
boat.” 

“We won’t forget,” said Sheena, who had come up behind me, splashing 



like crazy. 

I couldn’t help feeling just a little bit excited. I’d always wanted to see a 
real, live shark. 

I’d seen sharks at the aquarium, of course. But they were trapped in a glass 
tank, where they just swam around restlessly, perfectly harmless. 

Not very exciting. 

I wanted to spot a shark’s fin on the horizon, floating over the water, closer, 
closer, heading right for us.... 

In other words, I wanted adventure. 

The Cassandra was anchored out in the ocean, a few hundred yards away 
from Clamshell Reef. The reef surrounded the island. Between the reef and the 
island stretched a beautiful lagoon. 

Nothing was going to stop me from exploring that lagoon—no matter what 
Dr. D. said. 

“Come on, Billy,” Sheena called, adjusting her mask. “Let’s check out that 
school of fish.” 

She pointed to a patch of tiny ripples in the water near the bow of the boat. 
She slid the mouthpiece into her mouth and lowered her head into the water. I 
followed her to the ripples. 

Soon Sheena and I were surrounded by hundreds of tiny, neon-blue fish. 

Underwater, I always felt as if I were in a faraway world. Breathing through 
the snorkel, I could live down here with the fish and the dolphins, I thought. 
After a while, maybe I would grow flippers and a fin. 

The tiny blue fish began to swim away, and I swam with them. They were 
so great-looking! I didn’t want them to leave me behind. 

Suddenly, the fish all darted from view. I tried to follow, but they were too 

fast. 

They had vanished! 

Had something scared them away? 

I glanced around. Clumps of seaweed floated near the surface. Then I saw a 
flash of red. 

I floated closer, peering through the mask. A few yards ahead of me I saw 
bumpy red formations. Red coral. 

Oh, no, I thought. Clamshell Reef. Dr. D. told me not to swim this far. 

I began to turn around. I knew I should swim back to the boat. 

But I was tempted to stay and explore a little. After all, I was already there. 



The reef looked like a red sand castle, filled with underwater caves and 
tunnels. Small fish darted in and out of them. The fish were bright yellow and 
blue. 

Maybe I could swim over and explore one of those tunnels, I thought. How 
dangerous could it be? 

Suddenly, I felt something brush against my leg. It tickled and sent a tingle 
up my leg. 

A fish? 

I glanced around, but I didn’t see anything. 

Then I felt it again. 

A tingling against my leg. 

And then it clutched me. 

Again I turned to see what it was. Again I saw nothing. 

My heart began to race. I knew it was probably nothing dangerous. But I 
wished I could see it. 

I turned and started back for the boat, kicking hard. 

But something grabbed my right leg—and held on! 

I froze in fear. Then I frantically kicked my leg as hard as I could. 

Let go! Let go of me! 

I couldn’t see it—and I couldn’t pull free! 

The water churned and tossed as I kicked with all my strength. 

Overcome with terror, I lifted my head out of the water and choked out a 
weak cry: “Help!” 

But it was no use. 

Whatever it was, it kept pulling me down. Down. 

Down to the bottom of the sea.

“Help!” I cried out again. “Sheena! Dr. D.!” 

I was dragged below the surface again. I felt the slimy tentacle tighten 
around my ankle. 

As I sank underwater, I turned—and saw it. 

It loomed huge and dark. 

A sea monster! 

Through the churning waters, it glared at me with one giant brown eye. The 
terrifying creature floated underwater like an enormous, dark green balloon. Its 
mouth opened in a silent cry, revealing two rows of jagged, sharp teeth. 

An enormous octopus! But it had at least twelve tentacles! 

Twelve long, slimy tentacles. One was wrapped around my ankle. Another 
one slid toward me. 

NO! 

My arms thrashed the water. 

I gulped in mouthfuls of air. 

I struggled to the surface—but the huge creature dragged me down again. 

I couldn’t believe it. As I sank, scenes from my life actually flashed before 
my eyes. 

I saw my parents, waving to me as I boarded the yellow school bus for my 
first day of school. 

Mom and Dad! I’ll never see them again! 

What a way to go, I thought. Killed by a sea monster! 

No one will believe it. 

Everything started to turn red. I felt dizzy, weak. 

But something was pulling me, pulling me up. 

Up to the surface. Away from the tentacled monster. 

I opened my eyes, choking and sputtering. 

I stared up at Dr. D! 

“Billy! Are you all right?” Dr. D. studied me with concern. 

I coughed and nodded. I kicked my right leg. The slimy tentacle was gone. 

The dark creature had vanished. 



“I heard you screaming and saw you thrashing about,” said Dr. D. “I swam 
over from the boat as fast as I could. What happened?” 

Dr. D. had a yellow life jacket over his shoulders. He slipped a rubber 
lifesaver ring over my head. I floated easily now, the life ring under my arms. 

I had lost my flippers in the struggle. My mask and snorkel dangled around 
my neck. 

Sheena swam over and floated beside me, treading water. 

“It grabbed my leg!” I cried breathlessly. “It tried to pull me under!” 

“What grabbed your leg, Billy?” asked Dr. D. “I don’t see anything around 
here—” 

“It was a sea monster,” I told him. “A huge one! I felt its slimy tentacle 
grabbing my leg.... Ouch!” 

Something pinched my toe. 

“It’s back!” I shrieked in horror. 

Sheena popped out of the water and shook her wet hair, laughing. 

“That was me, you dork!” she cried. 

“Billy, Billy,” Dr. D. murmured. “You and your wild imagination.” He 
shook his head. “You nearly scared me to death. Please—don’t ever do that 
again. Your leg probably got tangled in a piece of seaweed, that’s all.” 

“But—but—!” I sputtered. 

He dipped his hand in the water and pulled up a handful of slimy green 
strings. “There’s seaweed everywhere.” 

“But I saw it!” I shouted. “I saw its tentacles, its big, pointy teeth!” 

“There’s no such thing as sea monsters,” said Sheena. Miss Know-It-All. 

“Let’s discuss it on the boat,” my uncle said, dropping the clump of 
seaweed back in the water. 

“Come on. Swim back with me. And stay away from the reef. Swim around 
it.” 

He turned around and started swimming toward the Cassandra. I saw that 
the sea monster had pulled me into the lagoon. The reef lay between us and the 
boat. But there was a break in the reef we could swim through. 

I followed them, thinking angry thoughts. 

Why didn’t they believe me? 

I had seen the creature grab my leg. It wasn’t a stupid clump of seaweed. It 
wasn’t my imagination. 

I was determined to prove them wrong. I’d find that creature and show it to 



them myself—someday. But not today. 

Now I was ready to get back to the safety of the boat. 

I swam up to Sheena and called, “Race you to the boat.” 

“Last one there is a chocolate-covered jellyfish!” she cried. 

Sheena can’t refuse a race. She started speeding toward the boat, but I 
caught her by the arm. 

“Wait,” I said. “No fair. You’re wearing flippers. Take them off.” 

“Too bad!” she cried, and pulled away. “See you at the boat!” I watched her 
splash away, building a good lead. 

She’s not going to win, I decided. 

I stared at the reef up ahead. 

It would be faster just to swim over the reef. A shortcut. 

I turned and started to swim straight toward the red coral. 

“Billy! Get back here!” Dr. D. shouted. 

I pretended I didn’t hear him. 

The reef loomed ahead. I was almost there. 

I saw Sheena splashing ahead of me. I kicked extra-hard. I knew she’d 
never have the guts to swim over the reef. She’d swim around the end of it. I 
would cut through and beat her. 

But my arms suddenly began to ache. I wasn’t used to swimming so far. 

Maybe I can stop at the reef and rest my arms for a second, I thought. 

I reached the reef. I turned around. Sheena was swimming to the left, 
around the reef. I figured I had a few seconds to rest. 

I stepped onto the red coral reef— 

—and screamed in horror!

My foot burned as if it were on fire. The throbbing pain shot up my leg. 

I screamed and dove into the water. 

When I surfaced, I heard Sheena yelling, “Dr. D.! Come quick!” 

My foot burned, even in the cold ocean water. 

Dr. D. came up beside me. “Billy, what’s the problem now?” he demanded. 
“I saw him do something really stupid,” Sheena said, smirking. 

If my foot hadn’t been burning up, I definitely would have punched out her 
lights. 

“My foot!” I moaned. “I stepped on the reef—and—and—” 

Dr. D. held on to the lifesaver ring around my waist. “Ow. That’s painful,” 
he said, reaching up to pat my shoulder. “But you’ll be all right. The burning will 
stop in a little while.” 

He pointed to the reef. “All that bright red coral is fire coral.” 

“Huh? Fire coral?” I stared back at it. 

“Even I knew that!” Sheena said. 

“It’s covered with a mild poison,” my uncle continued. “When it touches 
your skin, it burns like fire.” 

Now he tells me, I thought. 

“Don’t you know anything ?” Sheena asked sarcastically. 

She was asking for it. She really was. 

“You’re lucky you only burned your foot,” Dr. D. said. “Coral can be very 
sharp. You could have cut your foot and gotten poison into your bloodstream. 
Then you’d really be in trouble.” 

“Wow! What kind of trouble?” Sheena asked. She seemed awfully eager to 
hear about all the terrible things that could have happened to me. 

Dr. D.’s expression turned serious. “The poison could paralyze you,” he 

said. 

“Oh great,” I said. 

“So keep away from the red coral from now on,” Dr. D. warned. “And stay 
away from the lagoon, too.” 

“But that’s where the sea monster lives!” I protested. “We have to go back 



there. I have to show it to you!” 

Sheena bobbed in the blue-green water. “No such thing, no such thing,” she 
chanted. Her favorite phrase. “No such thing—right, Dr. D.?” 

“Well, you never know,” Dr. D. replied thoughtfully. “We don’t know all of 
the creatures that live in the oceans, Sheena. It’s better to say that scientists have 
never seen one.” 

“So there, She-Ra,” I said. 

Sheena spit a stream of water at me. She hates it when I call her She-Ra. 
“Listen, kids—I’m serious about staying away from this area,” said Dr. D. 
“There may not be a sea monster in that lagoon, but there could be sharks, 
poisonous fish, electric eels. Any number of dangerous creatures. Don’t swim 
over there.” 

He paused and frowned at me, as if to make sure I’d been paying attention. 
“How’s your foot feeling, Billy?” he asked. 

“It’s a little better now,” I told him. 

“Good. Enough adventure for one morning. Let’s get back to the boat. It’s 
almost lunchtime.” 

We all started swimming back to the Cassandra. 

As I kicked, I felt something tickle my leg again. 

Seaweed? 

No. 

It brushed against my thigh like— fingers. 

“Cut it out, Sheena,” I shouted angrily. I spun around to splash water in her 

face. 

But she wasn’t there. She wasn’t anywhere near me. 

She was up ahead, swimming beside Dr. D. 

Sheena couldn’t possibly have tickled me. 

But something definitely did. 

I stared down at the water, suddenly gripped with terror. 

What was down there? 

Why was it teasing me like that? 

Was it preparing to grab me again and pull me down forever?

Alexander DuBrow, Dr. D.’s assistant, helped us aboard the boat. 

“Hey, I heard shouting,” Alexander said. “Is everything okay?” 

“Everything is fine, Alexander,” said Dr. D. “Billy stepped on some fire 
coral, but he’s all right.” 

As I climbed up the ladder, Alexander grabbed my hands and pulled me 
aboard. 

“Wow, Billy,” he said. “Fire coral. I accidentally bumped into the fire coral 
my first day here. I saw stars. I really did, man. You sure you’re okay?” 

I nodded and showed him my foot. “It feels better now. But that wasn’t the 
worst thing that happened. I was almost eaten by a sea monster!” 

“No such thing, no such thing,” Sheena chanted. 

“I really saw it,” I insisted. “They don’t believe me. But it was there. In the 
lagoon. It was big and green and—” 

Alexander smiled. “If you say so, Billy,” he said. He winked at Sheena. 

I wanted to punch out his lights, too. 

Big deal science student. What did he know? 

Alexander was in his early twenties. But, unlike Dr. D., he didn’t look like a 
scientist. 

He looked more like a football player. He was very tall, about six feet four 
inches, and muscular. He had thick, wavy blond hair and blue eyes that crinkled 
in the corners. He had broad shoulders, and big, powerful-looking hands. He 
spent a lot of time in the sun and had a smooth, dark tan. 

“I hope you’re all hungry,” Alexander said. “I made chicken salad 
sandwiches for lunch.” 

“Oh. Great,” Sheena said, rolling her eyes. 

Alexander did most of the cooking. He thought he was good at it. But he 
wasn’t. 

I went below deck to my cabin to change out of my wet bathing suit. My 
cabin was really just a tiny sleeping cubby with a cupboard for my things. 
Sheena had one just like it. Dr. D. and Alexander had bigger cabins that they 
could actually walk around in. 

We ate in the galley, which was what Dr. D. called the boat’s kitchen. It had 



a built-in table and built-in seats, and a small area for cooking. 

When I entered the galley, Sheena was already sitting at the table. There 
was a big sandwich on a plate in front of her, and one waiting for me. 

Neither of us was too eager to try Alexander’s chicken salad. The night 
before, we had had Brussels sprouts casserole. For breakfast this morning, he 
served us whole wheat pancakes that sank to the bottom of my stomach like the 
Titanic going down! 

“You first,” I whispered to my sister. 

“Uh-uh,” Sheena said, shaking her head. “You try it. You’re older.” 

My stomach growled. I sighed. There was nothing to do but taste it. 

I sank my teeth into the sandwich and started chewing. 

Not bad, I thought at first. A little chicken, a little mayonnaise. It actually 
tasted like a regular chicken salad sandwich. 

Then, suddenly, my tongue started to burn. My whole mouth was on fire! 

I let out a cry and grabbed for the glass of iced tea in front of me. I downed 
the entire glass. 

“Fire coral!” I screamed. “You put fire coral in the chicken salad!” 

Alexander laughed. “Just a little chili pepper. For taste. You like it?” 

“I think I’d rather have cereal for lunch,” Sheena said, setting down her 
sandwich. “If you don’t mind.” 

“You can’t have cereal for every meal,” Alexander replied, frowning. “No 
wonder you’re so skinny, Sheena. You never eat anything but cereal. Where’s 
your spirit of adventure?” 

“I think I’ll have cereal, too,” I said sheepishly. “Just for a change of pace.” 

Dr. D. came into the galley. “What’s for lunch?” he asked. 

“Chicken salad sandwiches,” said Alexander. “I made them spicy.” 

“Very spicy,” I warned him. 

Dr. D. glanced at me and raised an eyebrow. “Oh, really?” he said. “You 
know, I’m not very hungry. I think I’ll just have cereal for lunch.” 

“Maybe Billy and I could make dinner tonight,” Sheena offered. She poured 
cereal into a bowl and added milk. “It’s not fair for Alexander to cook all the 
time.” 

“That’s a nice idea, Sheena,” said Dr. D. “What do you two know how to 
make?” 

“I know how to make brownies from a mix,” I offered. 

“And I know how to make fudge,” said Sheena. 



“Hmm,” said Dr. D. “Maybe I’ll cook tonight. How does grilled fish 
sound?” 

“Great!” I said. 

After lunch, Dr. D. went into his office to go over some notes. Alexander led 
Sheena and me into the main lab to show us around. 

The work lab was really cool. It had three big glass tanks along the wall 
filled with weird, amazing fish. 

The smallest tank held two bright yellow sea horses and an underwater 
trumpet. The underwater trumpet was a long, red-and-white fish shaped like a 
tube. There were also a lot of guppies swimming around in this tank. 

Another tank held some flame angelfish, which were orange-red like fire, 
and a harlequin tusk-fish, with orange-and-aqua tiger stripes for camouflage. 

The biggest tank held a long, black-and-yellow snakelike thing with a 
mouth full of teeth. 

“Ugh!” Sheena made a disgusted face as she stared at the long fish. “That 
one is really gross!” 

“That’s a black ribbon eel,” said Alexander. “He bites, but he’s not deadly. 
We call him Biff.” 

I snarled through the glass at Biff, but he ignored me. 

I wondered what it would be like to come face to face with Biff in the 
ocean. His teeth looked nasty, but he wasn’t nearly as big as the sea monster. I 
figured William Deep, Jr., world-famous undersea explorer, could handle it. 

I turned away from the fish tanks and stood by the control panel, staring at 
all the knobs and dials. 

“What does this do?” I asked. I pushed a button. A loud horn blared. We all 
jumped, startled. 

“It honks the horn,” Alexander said, laughing. 

“Dr. D. told Billy not to touch things without asking first,” said Sheena. 
“He’s told him a million times. He never listens.” 

“Shut up, She-Ra!” I said sharply. 

“You shut up.” 

“Hey—no problem,” said Alexander, raising both hands, motioning for us 
to chill out. “No harm done.” 

I turned back to the panel. Most of the dials were lit up, with little red 
indicators moving across their faces. I noticed one dial that was dark, its red 



indicator still. 

“What’s this for?” I asked, pointing to the dark dial. “It looks like you 
forgot to turn it on.” 

“Oh, that controls the Nansen bottle,” Alexander said. “It’s broken.” 

“What’s a Nansen bottle?” asked Sheena. 

“It collects samples of seawater from way down deep,” said Alexander. 

“Why don’t you fix it?” I asked. 

“We can’t afford to,” said Alexander. 

“Why not?” asked Sheena. “Doesn’t the university give you money?” 

We both knew that Dr. D.’s research was paid for by a university in Ohio. 

“They gave us money for our research,” Alexander explained. “But it’s 
almost gone. We’re waiting to see if they’ll give us more. In the meantime, we 
don’t have the money to fix things.” 

“What if the Cassandra breaks down or something?” I asked. 

“Then I guess we’ll have to put her in dry dock for a while,” said 
Alexander. “Or else find a new way to get more money.” 

“Wow,” said Sheena. “That would mean no more summer visits.” 

I hated to think of the Cassandra just sitting on a dock. Even worse was the 
thought of Dr. D. being stuck on land with no fish to study. 

Our uncle was miserable whenever he had to go ashore. He didn’t feel 
comfortable unless he was on a boat. I know, because one Christmas he came to 
our house to visit. 

Usually Dr. D. is fun to be with. But that Christmas visit was a nightmare. 

Dr. D. spent the whole time pacing through the house. He barked orders at 
us like a sea captain. 

“Billy, sit up straight!” he yelled at me. “Sheena, swab the decks!” 

He just wasn’t himself. 

Finally, on Christmas Eve, my dad couldn’t take it anymore. He told Dr. D. 
to shape up or ship out. 

Dr. D. ended up spending a good part of Christmas Day in the bathtub 
playing with my old toy boats. As long as he stayed in the water, he was back to 
normal. 

I never wanted to see Dr. D. stranded on land again. 

“Don’t worry, kids,” Alexander said. “Dr. D. has always found a way to get 
by.” 


I hoped Alexander was right. 



I studied another strange dial, marked Sonar Probes. 

“Hey, Alexander,” I said. “Will you show me how the sonar probes work?” 

“Sure,” said Alexander. “Just let me finish a few chores.” 

He walked over to the first fish tank. He scooped out a few guppies with a 
small net. 

“Who wants to feed Biff today?” 

“Not me,” said Sheena. “Yuck!” 

“No way!” I said as I stepped to a porthole and peered out. 

I thought I heard a motor outside. So far we had seen very few other boats. 
Not many people passed by Ilandra. 

A white boat chugged up to the side of the Cassandra. It was smaller but 
newer than our boat. A logo on the side said Marina Zoo. 

A man and a woman stood on the deck of the zoo boat. They were both 
neatly dressed in khaki pants and button-down shirts. The man had a short, neat 
haircut, and the woman’s brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail. She carried a 
black briefcase. 

The man waved to someone on the deck of the Cassandra. I figured he had 
to be waving at Dr. D. 

Now Sheena and Alexander stood beside me at the porthole, watching. 

“Who’s that?” Sheena asked. 

Alexander cleared his throat. “I’d better go see what this is about,” he said. 

He handed Sheena the net with the guppies in it. “Here,” he said. “Feed 
Biff. I’ll be back later.” 

He left the lab in a hurry. 

Sheena looked at the squirming guppies in the net and made a face. 

“I’m not going to stay here and watch Biff eat these poor guppies.” She 
stuck the net in my hand and ran out of the cabin. 

I didn’t want to watch Biff eat the poor fish, either. But I didn’t know what 
else to do with them. 

I quickly dumped the guppies into Biff’s tank. The eel’s head shot forward. 
His teeth clamped down on a fish. The guppy disappeared. Biff grabbed for 
another one. 

He was a fast eater. 

I dropped the net on a table and walked out of the lab. 

I made my way down the narrow passageway, planning to go up on deck 
for some air. 



I wondered if Dr. D. would let me do some more snorkeling this afternoon. 

If he said yes, maybe I would swim toward the lagoon, see if I could find 
any sign of the sea monster. 

Was I scared? 

Yes. 

But I was also determined to prove to my sister and uncle that I wasn’t 
crazy. That I wasn’t making it up. 

I was passing Dr. D.’s office when I heard voices. I figured Dr. D. and 
Alexander must be in there with the two people from the zoo. 

I paused for just a second. I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, I swear. But the man 
from the zoo had a loud voice, and I couldn’t help but hear him. 

And what he said was the most amazing thing I had ever heard in my 
whole, entire life. 

“I don’t care how you do it, Dr. Deep,” the man bellowed. “But I want you 
to find that mermaid!” 



6 


A mermaid! 

Was he serious? 

I couldn’t believe it. Did he really want my uncle to find a real, live 
mermaid? 

I knew Sheena would start chanting, “No such thing, no such thing.” But 
here was a grown man, a man who worked for a zoo, talking about a mermaid. It 
had to be real! 

My heart started to pound with excitement. I might be one of the first 
people on Earth ever to see a mermaid! I thought. 

And then I had an even better thought: What if I was the one to find her? 

I’d be famous! I’d be on TV and everything! 

William Deep, Jr., the famous sea explorer! 

Well, after I heard that, I couldn’t just walk away. I had to hear more. 

Holding my breath, I pressed my ear to the door and listened. 

“Mr. Showalter, Ms. Wickman, please understand,” I heard Dr. D. saying. 
“I’m a scientist, not a circus trainer. My work is serious. I can’t waste my time 
looking for fairy tale creatures.” 

“We’re quite serious, Dr. Deep,” said Ms. Wickman. “There is a mermaid in 
these waters. And if anyone can find her, you can.” 

I heard Alexander ask, “What makes you think there’s really a mermaid out 
there?” 

“A fisherman from a nearby island spotted her,” replied the man from the 
zoo. “He said he got pretty close to her—and he’s sure she’s real. He saw her 
near the reef —this reef, just off Ilandra.” 

The reef! Maybe she lives in the lagoon! 

I leaned closer to the door. I didn’t want to miss a word of this. 

“Some of these fishermen are very superstitious, Mr. Showalter,” my uncle 
scoffed. “For years there have been stories... but no real reason to believe them.” 

“We didn’t believe the man ourselves,” said the woman. “Not at first. But 
we asked some other fishermen in the area, and they claim to have seen the 
mermaid, too. And I think they’re telling the truth. Their descriptions of her 
match, down to the smallest detail.” 



I could hear my uncle’s desk chair creak. I imagined him leaning forward as 
he asked, “And, how, exactly, did they describe her?” 

“They said she looked like a young girl,” Mr. Showalter told him. “Except 
for the”—he cleared his throat—“the fish tail. She’s small, delicate, with long, 
blond hair.” 

“They described her tail as shiny and bright green,” said the woman. “I 
know it sounds incredible, Dr. Deep. But when we spoke to the fishermen, we 
were convinced that they really saw a mermaid!” 

There was a pause. 

Was I missing something? I pressed my ear to the door. I heard my uncle 
ask, “And, why, exactly, do you want to capture this mermaid?” 

“Obviously, a real, live mermaid would be a spectacular attraction at a zoo 
like ours,” said the woman. “People from all over the world would flock to see 
her. The Marina Zoo would make millions of dollars.” 

“We are prepared to pay you very well for your trouble, Dr. Deep,” said Mr. 
Showalter. “I understand you are running out of money. What if the university 
refuses to give you more? It would be terrible if you had to stop your important 
work just because of that.” 

“The Marina Zoo can promise you one million dollars,” said the woman. “If 
you find the mermaid. I’m sure your lab could run for a long time on that much 
money.” 

A million dollars! I thought. How could Dr. D. turn down that kind of 
money? 

My heart pounded with excitement. I pushed against the door, straining to 

hear. 


What would my uncle’s answer be? 



7 


Leaning hard against the door, I heard Dr. D. let out a long, low whistle. “That’s 
quite a lot of money, Ms. Wickman,” I heard him say. 

There was a long pause. Then he continued. “But even if mermaids existed, 
I wouldn’t feel right about capturing one for a zoo to put on display.” 

“I promise you we would take excellent care of her,” replied Mr. Showalter. 
“Our dolphins and whales are very well cared for. The mermaid, of course, 
would get extra-special treatment.” 

“And, remember, Dr. Deep,” said Ms. Wickman. “If you don’t find her, 
someone else will. And there’s no guarantee that they will treat the mermaid as 
well as we will.” 

“I suppose you’re right,” I heard my uncle reply. “It would certainly be a 
big boost to my research if I found her.” 

“Then you’ll do it?” asked Mr. Showalter eagerly. 

Say yes, Dr. D.! I thought. Say yes! 

I pressed my whole body against the door. “Yes,” my uncle answered. “If 
there really is a mermaid, I’ll find her.” 

Excellent! I thought. 

“Very good,” said Ms. Wickman. 

“Excellent decision,” Mr. Showalter added enthusiastically. “I knew we had 
come to the right man for the job.” 

“We’ll be back in a couple of days to see how the search is going. I hope 
you’ll have some good news by then,” Ms. Wickman said. 

“That’s not much time,” I heard Alexander remark. 

“We know,” Ms. Wickman replied. “But, obviously, the sooner you find 
her, the better.” 

“And, please,” Mr. Showalter said, “please keep this a secret. No one must 
know about the mermaid. I’m sure you can imagine what would happen if—” 

CRASSSSSSSH! 

I lost my balance. I fell against the door. 

To my shock, it swung open—and I tumbled into the room. 



8 


I landed in a heap in the center of the cabin floor. 

Dr. D., Mr. Showalter, Ms. Wickman, and Alexander all gaped at me with 
their mouths open. I guess they hadn’t expected me to drop in. 

“Uh... hi, everyone,” I murmured. I felt my face burning, and knew that I 
was blushing. “Nice day for a mermaid hunt.” 

Mr. Showalter jumped to his feet angrily. He glared at my uncle. “This was 
supposed to be a secret!” 

Alexander strode across the room and helped me to my feet. “Don’t worry 
about Billy,” he said. He put a protective arm around me. “You can trust him.” 

“I’m very embarrassed,” Dr. D. told his visitors. “This is my nephew, Billy 
Deep. He and his sister are visiting me for a few weeks.” 

“Can they keep our secret?” asked Ms. Wickman. 

Dr. D. turned his gaze on Alexander. Alexander nodded. 

“Yes, I’m sure they can,” said Dr. D. “Billy won’t say anything to anyone. 
Right, Billy?” 

He narrowed his eyes at me. I really do hate it when he does that. But this 
time I couldn’t blame him. 

I shook my head. “No. I won’t tell anyone. I swear.” 

“Just to be on the safe side, Billy,” said Dr. D., “don’t mention the mermaid 
to Sheena. She’s too young to have to keep a big secret like this.” 

“I promise,” I replied solemnly. I raised my right hand as if swearing an 
oath. “I won’t breathe a word to Sheena.” 

This was so cool! 

I knew the biggest secret in the world—and Sheena wouldn’t have a clue! 

The man and woman from the zoo exchanged glances. I could see they 
were still worried. 

Alexander said, “You really can trust Billy. He’s very serious for someone 
his age.” 

You bet I’m serious, I thought. 

I’m William Deep, Jr., world-famous mermaid catcher. 

Mr. Showalter and Ms. Wickman seemed to relax a little. 



“Good,” said Ms. Wickman. She shook hands with Dr. D., Alexander, and 
me. 

Mr. Showalter gathered up some papers and put them into the briefcase. 
“We’ll see you in a few days, then,” said Ms. Wickman. “Good luck.” 

I won’t need luck, I thought, watching them roar away on their boat a few 
minutes later. 

I won’t need luck because I have skill. And daring. 

My head spun with all kinds of exciting thoughts. 

Would I let Sheena be on TV with me after I single-handedly captured the 
mermaid? 

Probably not. 

That night I sneaked off the boat and slipped into the dark water. I swam 
noiselessly toward the lagoon. 

I glanced back at the Cassandra. It floated quietly. All the portholes were 

dark. 

Good, I thought. No one is awake to notice that I’m gone. No one knows 
I’m out here. No one knows I’m swimming in the sea at night, all alone. 

Swimming steadily, easily, under the silvery moonlight, I made my way 
around the reef and into the dark lagoon. 

I slowed my stroke just past the reef. 

My eyes darted eagerly around the lagoon. The waves lapped gently under 
me. The water sparkled as if a million tiny diamonds floated on the surface. 
Where was the mermaid? 

I knew she was there. I knew I would find her here. 

From deep below me, I heard a low rumble. 

I listened hard. The sound, faint at first, grew louder. 

The waves tossed as the sound became a steady roar. 

It rumbled like an earthquake. An earthquake on the ocean floor. 

The waves tumbled and tossed. I struggled to stay on top of them. 

What was happening? 

Suddenly, from the middle of the lagoon, a huge wave swelled. It rose 
higher, like a gigantic geyser. 

Higher. Over my head. As tall as a building! 

A tidal wave? 

No. 



The wave broke. 

The dark creature pushed up underneath it. 

Water slid off its grotesque body. Its single eye stared out darkly at me. Its 
tentacles writhed and stretched. 

I screamed. 

The monster blinked its muddy brown eye at me. 

I tried to turn and swim away. 

But it was too fast. 

The tentacles whipped out—and grabbed me, tightening, tightening around 
my waist. 

Then a slimy, cold tentacle wrapped around my neck and started to squeeze. 



9 


“I—I can’t breathe!” I managed to choke out. 

I tugged at the tentacle twining around my throat. 

“Help me—somebody!” 

I opened my eyes—and stared up at the ceiling. 

I was lying in bed. 

In my cabin. 

The sheet was wrapped tightly around me. 

I took a deep breath and waited for my heart to stop thudding. A dream. 

Only a dream. 

I rubbed my eyes, lifted myself, and peered out the porthole. The sun was 
just rising over the horizon. The sky was morning red. The water a hazy purple. 

Squinting past the reef, I saw the lagoon. Perfectly still. Not a sea monster 
in sight. 

I wiped the sweat from my forehead with my pajama sleeve. 

No need to be afraid, I told myself. It was just a dream. A bad dream. 

I shook my head, trying to forget about the sea monster. 

I couldn’t let it scare me. I couldn’t let it stop me from finding that 
mermaid. 

Was anyone up? Had I yelled out loud in my sleep? 

I listened carefully. I could hear only the creaking of the boat, the splash of 
waves against its side. 

The pink morning sunlight cheered me. The dark water looked inviting. 

I slipped into my bathing suit and crept out of my cabin as quietly as I 
could. I didn’t want anyone to hear me. 

In the galley I saw a half-empty pot of coffee sitting on the warmer. That 
meant Dr. D. was already up. 

I tiptoed down the passageway and listened. I could hear him puttering 
around in the main lab. 

I grabbed my snorkel, flippers, and mask and went up on deck. Nobody up 
there. 

The coast was clear. 



Silently, I climbed down the ladder, slipped into the water, and snorkeled 
toward the lagoon. 

I know it was crazy to sneak away like that. But you can’t imagine how 
excited I was. Even in my wildest daydreams as William Deep, Jr., undersea 
explorer, I never thought I would see a real, live mermaid! 

As I snorkeled toward the lagoon, I tried to imagine what she would look 

like. 

Mr. Showalter had said she looked like a young girl with long, blond hair 
and a green fish tail. 

Weird, I thought. 

Half-human, half-fish. 

I tried to imagine my own legs replaced by a fish tail. 

I’d be the greatest swimmer on Earth if I had a fish tail, I thought. I could 
win the Olympics without even practicing. 

I wonder if she’s pretty? I thought. And I wonder if she can talk! I hope she 
can. She can tell me all kinds of secrets of the oceans. 

I wonder how she breathes underwater? 

I wonder if she thinks like a human or like a fish? 

So many questions. 

This is going to be the greatest adventure of my life, I thought. After I’m 
famous, I’ll write a book about my undersea adventures. I’ll call it Courage of 
the Deep, by William Deep, Jr. Maybe someone will even turn it into a movie. 

I raised my head and saw that I was nearing the reef. I concentrated on 
keeping away from it. I didn’t want to touch that fire coral again. 

I couldn’t wait to explore the lagoon. I was so excited, I forgot all about the 
terrifying dream I had had the night before. 

I kicked my legs carefully, watching out for red coral. 

I was nearly past the reef when I felt something brush my leg. 

“Oh!” I cried out and swallowed a mouthful of salty water. 

Sputtering and choking, I felt something wrap around my ankle. 

As it grabbed at me, it scratched my ankle. 

This time I knew for sure it wasn’t seaweed. 

Seaweed doesn’t have claws! 



10 


Ignoring the panic that nearly froze me, I kicked and thrashed with all my 
strength. 

“Stop it! Stop kicking me!” a voice screamed. 

The mermaid? 

“Hey—!” I cried out angrily as Sheena’s head appeared beside me. 

She pulled up her snorkeling mask. “I didn’t scratch you that hard!” she 
snapped. “You don’t have to go crazy!” 

“What are you doing here?” I cried. 

“What are you doing here?” she demanded nastily. “You know Dr. D. told 
us not to swim here.” 

“Then you shouldn’t be here —should you?” I shouted. 

“I knew you were up to something, so I followed you,” Sheena replied, 
adjusting her mask. 

“I’m not up to anything,” I lied. “I’m just snorkeling.” 

“Sure, Billy. You’re just snorkeling at six-thirty in the morning exactly 
where you’re not supposed to —and where you burned your foot on that fire 
coral yesterday. You’re either up to something, or you’re totally crazy!” She 
squinted at me, waiting for a response. 

What a choice! I was either up to something, or crazy. Which should I 
admit to? 

If I admitted I was up to something, I’d have to tell her about the mermaid 
—and I couldn’t do that. 

“Okay,” I said with a casual shrug. “I guess I’m crazy.” 

“Well, big news,” she muttered sarcastically. “Come on back to the boat, 
Billy,” said Sheena. “Dr. D. will be looking for us.” 

“You go back. I’ll be there in a little while.” 

“Billy,” said Sheena. “Dr. D. is going to be very mad. He’s probably ready 
to hop in the dinghy and search for us right now.” 

I was about to give up and go with her. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I 
saw a big splash on the other side of the reef. 

The mermaid! I thought. That’s got to be her! If I don’t go look for her now, 
I might miss her! 



I turned away from Sheena and started swimming very fast, straight for the 

reef. 

I could hear Sheena screaming, “Billy! Come back! Billy!” 

I thought I heard an extra note of panic in her voice, but I ignored it. Just 
Sheena trying to scare me again, I thought. 

“Billy!” she screamed again. “Billy!” I kept on swimming. No way I was 
going to stop now. But as it turned out, I should have listened to her. 



11 


Swimming fast, I raised my head, searching for a good place to swim safely over 
the fire coral. 

I saw another splash. Across the lagoon. Near the shore. 

That’s got to be the mermaid! I thought excitedly. 

I stared hard, trying to catch a glimpse of her. 

I thought I saw some kind of fin. 

I made my way past the reef into the deep, still waters of the lagoon. I 
strained to see the mermaid, but my mask had fogged. 

Rats! I thought. What a time for my mask to start leaking! 

I came up for air and pulled off the mask. I hoped I wouldn’t lose sight of 
the mermaid because of this. 

I wiped the water from my eyes and, leaving the mask wrapped around my 
wrist, stared toward the lagoon. 

That’s when I saw it. A few hundred yards away. 

Not the green fish tail of a mermaid. 

The fin I saw was a gray-white triangle sticking straight up in the water. 

The fin of a hammerhead shark. 

As I stared in horror, the fin turned in the water, and then ripped toward me, 
moving steady and straight as a torpedo. 



12 


Where was Sheena? 

Was she still behind me? 

I glanced back. I could see her in the distance, splashing back to the boat. 

I was forced to forget about Sheena as the gray fin swiftly moved closer. 

I thrashed my arms in the water, trying to swim away. 

When the shark swam right past me, I stopped thrashing. 

Would it go away? Would it leave me alone? 

My heart in my throat, I started swimming in the other direction, toward the 
reef. Away from the shark. 

I kept my eyes on that fin. 

It began to turn. The shark’s fin streamed toward me in a wide arc. 

“Ohhh.” I let out a terrified groan as I realized it was circling me. 

Now I didn’t know which way to go. The shark swam between me and the 
boat. If I could turn around and climb on to the reef, maybe I would be safe. 

The huge fin slid closer. 

I plunged toward the reef. I knew I had to keep distance between me and 
the shark. 

Suddenly, the fin shot up in front of me—between me and the reef. 

The shark kept circling, closing in, swimming faster and faster, making the 
circle smaller as he swam. 

I was trapped. But I couldn’t stay still. I couldn’t just float there, waiting for 
the shark to eat me. 

I had to fight. I kicked my legs in a panic as I swam toward the reef. 

I was nearer to the reef now. But the shark’s circles grew smaller, smaller. 

I breathed in quick, shallow gasps. I couldn’t think clearly. I was too 
terrified. The same two words echoed in my brain: The shark. The shark. 

Over and over again. The shark. The shark. 

The shark swam around me in a tight circle. His tail swished, sending up 
waves of water over me. 

The shark. The shark. 

I stared at the monster in wide-eyed horror. He swam so close, I could see 



him clearly. He was big—at least ten feet long. His head was wide and hideous, 
long like the head of a hammer, with an eye on each end. 

I heard my voice quivering, “No... no...” 

Something cold brushed my leg. 

The shark. The shark. 

My stomach lurched. I threw my head back and let out a howl of sheer 
terror. 

“Aaaaaiiii!” 

Pain jolted down my spine. 

The shark had bumped me with its snout. My body rose out of the water, 
then hit the surface with a smack. 

I froze. 

The shark was hungry. 

It wanted to fight. 

It circled me again, then zoomed straight for me. 

Its jaws opened. I saw rows and rows of sharp teeth. 

I screamed out a hoarse, “NO!” I thrashed, panicked. I kicked with all my 
strength. 

The razor teeth brushed by, just missing my leg. 

The reef. I had to get to the reef. It was my only chance. 

I dove for the coral. The shark plunged toward me. I dodged it once more. 

I grabbed the red coral. Pain shot through my hand. The fire coral. 

I didn’t care. 

The top of the reef sat just above the surface of the water. I tried to pull 
myself up. My whole body stung. 

I had almost made it. Soon I’d be safe. 

With a mighty kick, I hoisted myself onto the reef—and was yanked back 
into the water. 

My stomach slammed against the side of the reef. I felt a sharp stab of pain 
in my leg. 

I tried to pull my leg away. I couldn’t. 

It was caught in the jaws of the shark. 

My mind screamed with terror. 

The shark. The shark. 

It’s got me! 



13 


My entire body burned with pain. I slipped heavily into the water. 

The shark knew he had me. I had no strength left to fight. 

Then something splashed nearby. 

The shark released my leg and jerked toward the splash. 

I had no time to catch my breath. The shark circled back. It charged at me. 

The gaping jaws moved in for the kill. 

I shut my eyes and let out a shrill scream of terror. 

A second passed. Then another. 

Nothing happened. 

I heard a loud thump. 

I opened my eyes. 

Something had come between me and the shark, a few feet in front of me. 

I stared. The water churned white. A long, shiny green fish tail rose out of 
the water and splashed back down. 

Another fish was fighting the shark! 

The shark rolled over, then attacked. The green fish tail smacked the shark 
hard. The shark went under. 

I couldn’t see what was happening. The water rocked higher, tossing up 
frothy, white waves. 

All around me the water bubbled and churned, white with foam. Over the 
crash of the water, I heard shrill animal squeals. 

Sharks don’t squeal, do they? I thought. What is making that sound? 

The shark surfaced, its toothy jaws gaping. It snapped them at something, 
once, twice. Snapping at air. 

The long, green fish tail rose out of the water and smacked the shark hard. 
A direct hit on its broad hammerhead. 

The shark shut its jaws and sank below the surface. 

Then I heard a loud bump! The water stopped churning. 

A second later, the huge gray fin surfaced a few yards away, speeding off in 
the other direction. 

The shark was swimming away! 



I stared at the green fish tail as it arced over the dark, swelling water. 

As the waters calmed, I heard a low, musical sound. It was beautiful and 
slightly sad. Whistling and humming at the same time. 

It sounded something like a whale. But this creature was much smaller than 
a whale. 

The green tail swung around. Then the creature lifted its head. 

A head with long, blond hair. 

The mermaid! 



14 


Bobbing in the water, I forgot my burning pain as I gaped at her. 

To my amazement, the mermaid looked just as the zoo people had said she 
would. 

Her head and shoulders were smaller than mine, but her flashing green tail 
stretched out, long and powerful. Her wide, sea-green eyes sparkled. Her skin 
gave off a pale pink glow. 

I stared at her, unable to speak. 

She’s real! I thought. And she’s so beautiful! 

At last I found my voice. “You—you saved me,” I stammered. “You saved 
my life. Thank you!” 

She shyly lowered her eyes and cooed at me through shell-pink lips. What 
was she trying to say? 

“What can I do in return?” I asked her. “I’ll do anything I can.” 

She smiled, and uttered that haunting low hum. 

She was trying to talk to me. I wished I could understand her. 

She reached for my hand and examined it, frowning over the red burns from 
the fire coral. Her hand felt cool. She passed it over the palm of my hand, and 
the pain from the burns began to fade away. 

“Wow!” I exclaimed. I must have sounded pretty stupid, but I didn’t know 
what else to say. Her touch was like magic. When she held my hand, I could 
float without treading water. Just as she did. 

Was this another dream? 

I closed my eyes and opened them again. 

I was still floating in the sea, staring at a blond-haired mermaid. 

No. Not a dream. 

She smiled again and shook her head, making those low singing sounds. 

I could hardly believe that only a few minutes before I’d been frantically 
fighting off a hungry shark. 

I raised my head and searched the waters. The shark had vanished. The 
water had calmed, shimmering like gold now under the morning sunlight. And 
there I was, floating in the sea off a deserted island with a real mermaid. 

Sheena will never believe this, I thought. Not in a million years. 



Suddenly, the mermaid flipped her tail and disappeared under the water. 

Startled, I searched around for her. She had left without a trace—not a 
ripple, not a bubble. 

Where did she go? I wondered. Is she gone, just like that? Will I never see 
her again? 

I rubbed my eyes and looked for her again. No sign of her. A few fish 
darted past me. 

She had disappeared so instantly, I began to think I had dreamed her up 
after all. 

Just then, I felt a tiny pinch on my foot. 

“Ouch!” I yelled, quickly pulling away. I began to panic. The shark was 
back! 

Then, behind me, I heard a small splash and a whistlelike giggle. I turned 
around. 

The mermaid smiled mischievously at me. She snapped her fingers in a 
pinching motion. 

“It was you!” I cried, laughing with relief. “You’re worse than my little 
sister!” 

She whistled again and slapped her tail against the surface of the water. 

Suddenly, a dark shadow fell across her face. I raised my eyes to see what it 

was. 

Too late. 

A heavy net dropped over us. Startled, I thrashed my arms and legs. But 
that only tangled them more in the rope. 

The net tightened over both of us. We were thrown together. 

We struggled helplessly as the net jerked us up. 

The mermaid’s eyes widened and she squealed in terror. 

“EEEEEE!” she cried. 

We were being pulled up out of the water. 

“EEEEEEE!” The mermaid’s frightened wail rose like a siren, drowning 
out my feeble cries for help. 



15 


“Billy—I don’t believe it!” 

I gazed up through the holes in the net and recognized Dr. D. and Sheena. 
They struggled to pull us aboard the dinghy. 

Sheena stared down at me and the mermaid in amazement. Dr. D.’s eyes 
were wide, and his mouth hung open. 

“You’ve found her, Billy!” he said. “You’ve actually found the mermaid!” 

“Just get me out of this net!” I cried. Somehow, I didn’t feel so great about 
capturing the mermaid anymore. 

“The zoo people were right,” Dr. D. muttered to himself. “It’s unbelievable. 
It’s astounding. It’s historic....” 

We landed in a heap on the floor of the dinghy. The mermaid squirmed 
beside me in the net, making sharp, angry clicking noises. 

Dr. D. watched her closely. He touched her tail. 

The mermaid flapped it hard against the bottom of the boat. 

“Is there any way this could be a hoax?” he wondered aloud. 

“Billy—is this one of your dumb tricks?” Sheena demanded suspiciously. 

“It’s not a trick,” I said. “Now will you get me out of this net? The ropes are 
digging into my skin.” 

They ignored me. 

Sheena gently reached one finger through the net and touched the scales on 
the mermaid’s tail. “I can’t believe it,” she murmured. “She’s really real!” 

“Of course she’s real!” I cried. “We’re both real, and we’re both very 
uncomfortable!” 

“Well, it’s hard to believe anything you say,” Sheena snapped. “After all, 
you’ve been talking about sea monsters ever since we got here.” 

“I did see a sea monster!” I cried. 

“Quiet, kids,” said Dr. D. “Let’s get our discovery back to the sea lab.” 

He started the dinghy’s motor and we roared back to the big boat. 

Alexander stood on deck, waiting for us. “It’s really true!” he cried 
excitedly. “It’s really a mermaid!” 

Sheena tied the dinghy to the side of the Cassandra while Dr. D. and 



Alexander hoisted me and the mermaid aboard. 

Dr. D. opened the net and helped me out. The mermaid flopped her tail and 
got herself even more tangled in the net. 

Alexander shook my hand. “I’m proud of you, Billy. How did you do it? 
This is amazing.” He gave me a vigorous pat on the back. “Do you realize this is 
the greatest ocean find of the century? Maybe of all time?” 

“Thanks,” I said. “But I didn’t do anything. I didn’t find her —she found 

me. ” 

The mermaid flopped violently on deck. Her squeals became higher- 
pitched, more frantic. 

Alexander’s face fell. “We’ve got to do something for her,” he said 
urgently. 

“Dr. D., you’ve got to let her go,” I said. “She needs to be in the water.” 

“I’ll fill the big tank with seawater, Dr. D.,” said Alexander. He hurried off 
to fill the tank. 

“We can’t let her go just yet, Billy,” said Dr. D. “Not without examining her 
first.” His eyes were shining with excitement. But he saw how upset I was. “We 
won’t hurt her, Billy. She’ll be all right.” 

His eyes dropped to my leg, and he frowned. He kneeled down to look at it. 

“You’re bleeding, Billy,” he said. “Are you okay?” 

“I’m fine,” I said. “But the mermaid isn’t.” 

He ignored me. 

“How did this happen?” asked Dr. D. 

“A shark grabbed my leg,” I told him. “Just as he was about to clamp down, 
the mermaid came. She saved my life. You should have seen her fighting that 
shark.” 

Dr. D. turned to the mermaid as if seeing her for the first time. 

“Wow,” said Sheena. “She fought off a shark? All by herself?” 

The mermaid’s long green tail pounded angrily on the deck of the boat. 

“EEEEE! EEEEEE!” she cried shrilly. She almost sounded as if she were 
screaming. 

“Forget about my leg,” I shouted. “You’ve got to let the mermaid go!” 

Dr. D. stood up, shaking his head. “Billy, I’m a scientist. This mermaid is 
an extremely important discovery. If I let her go, I’d be letting down the entire 
scientific community. I’d be letting down the entire world!” 

“You just want the million dollars,” I muttered. 



I knew it was cruel, but I couldn’t stop myself. I hated seeing the mermaid 
so unhappy. 

Dr. D. looked hurt. 

“That’s not fair, Billy,” he said. “I think you know me better than that.” 

I avoided his gaze. Lowering my head, I pretended to examine the cut on 
my leg. It wasn’t very deep. Alexander had given me some gauze. I pressed it 
against the cut. 

“I only want the money to continue my research,” Dr. D. went on. “I would 
never use this mermaid to get rich.” 

That was true. I knew Dr. D. didn’t care about the money for himself. All he 
wanted was to keep on studying fish. 

“Just think about it, Billy. You’ve found a mermaid! A creature we all 
thought didn’t exist! We can’t just let her go. We’ve got to find out a little bit 
about her,” he said excitedly. 

I said nothing. 

“We won’t hurt her, Billy. I promise.” 

Alexander returned. “The tank is ready, Dr. D.” 

“Thanks.” Dr. D. followed him to the other side of the boat. 

I glanced at Sheena to see whose side she was on. Did she want to keep the 
mermaid? Or let her go? 

But Sheena just stood there, watching. Her face was tense. I could tell she 
wasn’t sure which of us was right. 

But when I looked at the mermaid, I knew I was right. 

She had finally stopped squirming and flipping her tail. Now she lay still on 
the deck, the net draped over her. She was breathing hard and staring out at the 
ocean with watery, sad eyes. 

I wished I’d never tried to find her in the first place. Now all I wanted was 
to find some way to help her get back to her home. 

Dr. D. and Alexander came back. They lifted the mermaid inside the net. 
Alexander lifted her tail, and Dr. D. held her head. 

“Don’t squirm, little mermaid,” Dr. D. said in a soothing voice. “Keep 
still.” 

The mermaid seemed to understand. She didn’t flop around. But her eyes 
rolled wildly, and she uttered low moans. 

Dr. D. and Alexander carried her to the giant glass tank. It stood on the deck 
now, full of fresh seawater. They gently dropped her into the tank, pulling the net 



away as she slid into the water. Then they put a screen top over the tank and 
clamped it shut. 

The mermaid churned the water with her tail. Then, gradually, her tail 
stopped moving. She grew still. 

Her body slumped lifelessly to the bottom of the tank. 

She didn’t move or breathe. 

“Noooo!” An angry cry escaped my lips. “She’s dead! She’s dead! We 
killed her!” 



16 


Sheena had moved to the other side of the tank. “Billy, look—!” she called to 
me. 

I hurried around to her. 

“The mermaid isn’t dead,” Sheena reported, pointing. “Look. She—she’s 
crying or something.” 

My sister was right. The mermaid had slumped to the bottom of the tank 
and had buried her face in her hands. “Now what do we do?” I asked. 

No one answered. 

“We have to find a method of feeding her,” my uncle said, rubbing his chin, 
his eyes on the tank. 

“Do you think she eats like a person or a fish?” I asked. 

“If only she could tell us,” said Alexander. “She can’t talk, can she, Billy?” 

“I don’t think so,” I said. “She just makes sounds. Whistles and clicks and 
hums.” 

“I’ll go down to the lab and get some equipment ready,” said Alexander. 
“Maybe we can find out something about her with the sonar monitor.” 

“Good idea,” said Dr. D. thoughtfully. 

Alexander hurried below. 

“I think I’d better go to Santa Anita for some supplies,” said Dr. D. Santa 
Anita was the nearest inhabited island. “I’ll buy lots of different kinds of foods. 
We can try them out on her until we find something she likes. Would you two 
like anything while I’m there?” 

“How about some peanut butter?” Sheena asked quickly. “There’s no way 
Alexander can ruin a peanut butter sandwich!” 

Dr. D. nodded as he climbed into the dinghy. “Peanut butter it is. Anything 
else? Billy?” 

I shook my head. 

“All right,” Dr. D. said. “I’ll be back in a few hours.” 

He started the motor, and the dinghy sped off toward Santa Anita. 

“It’s so hot,” Sheena complained. “I’m going down to my cabin for a 
while.” 

“Okay,” I said, my eyes on the mermaid. 



It was hot up on deck. There was no breeze, and the white-hot noon sun 
beat down on my face. 

But I couldn’t go below deck. I couldn’t leave the mermaid. 

She floated behind the glass, her long tail drooping. When she saw me, she 
pressed her hands and face to the glass and cooed sadly. 

I waved to her through the glass. 

She cooed and hummed in her low voice, trying to communicate with me. I 
listened, trying to understand. 

“Are you hungry?” I asked her. 

She stared at me blankly. 

“Are you hungry?” I repeated, rubbing my stomach. “Go like this”—I 
nodded my head up and down—“for yes. Do this for no.” I shook my head back 
and forth. 

I stopped and waited to see what she’d do. 

She nodded her head yes. 

“Yes?” I said. “You are hungry?” 

She shook her head no. 

“No? You’re not hungry?” 

She nodded her head yes. Then she shook her head no again. 

She’s just copying me, I thought. She doesn’t really understand. 

I took a step back and studied her in the tank. 

She’s young, I thought. She’s a lot like me. That means she must be hungry. 
And she probably likes to eat what I like. Right? 

Maybe. It was worth a try. 

I hurried down to the galley. I pulled open a cupboard and took out a 
package of chocolate chip cookies. 

Okay, so it’s not exactly seafood, I thought. But who wouldn’t like 
chocolate chip cookies? 

I grabbed a few cookies and stuffed the package back in the cupboard. 
Alexander came through on his way up to the deck. He was carrying some 
equipment in his arms. 

“Getting a snack?” he asked me. 

“For the mermaid,” I told him. “Do you think she’ll like them?” 

He shrugged his broad shoulders and said, “Who knows?” 

He followed me out on deck, carrying the equipment. 

“What’s all that stuff?” I asked him. 



“I thought we could run a few tests on the mermaid, to see what we can find 
out about her,” said Alexander. “But go ahead and feed her first.” 

“Okay,” I said. “Here goes.” 

I held a cookie up to the glass. The mermaid stared at it. I could see that she 
didn’t know what it was. 

“Mmmmm,” I said, patting my stomach. “Yummy.” 

The mermaid patted her tummy, imitating me. She stared out at me blankly 
with those sea-green eyes. 

Alexander reached up and unlatched the screen top. I handed him the 
cookie, and he dropped it into the tank. 

The mermaid watched it falling toward her through the water. She made no 
attempt to grab it. 

By the time it reached her, it was soggy. It fell apart in the tank. 

“Yuck,” I said. “Even I wouldn’t eat it now.” 

The mermaid pushed the soggy cookie pieces away. 

“Maybe Dr. D. will have something she likes when he gets back,” said 
Alexander. 

“I hope so,” I said. 

Alexander began to set up his equipment. He put a thermometer inside the 
tank, and some long white plastic tubes. 

“Oh, man,” Alexander mumbled, shaking his head. “I forgot my notebook.” 

He hurried back down to the lab. 

I watched the mermaid float sadly in her tank, with all the tubes coming out 
of it. She reminded me of the fish down in the lab. 

No, I thought. She’s not a fish. She shouldn’t be treated this way. 

I remembered how she had fought the shark. 

She could have been killed, I thought. Easily. But she fought the shark, 
anyway, just to help me. 

The mermaid cooed. Then I saw her wipe away the tears that had begun to 
mn down her face. 

She’s crying again, I thought, feeling guilty and miserable. She’s pleading 
with me. I put my face against the glass, as close to hers as I could get it. 

I’ve got to help her, I thought. 

I put a finger to my lips. “Ssshhh,” I whispered. “Stay quiet. I have to work 
quickly!” 

I knew I was about to do something that would make Dr. D. very angry. 



My uncle would probably never forgive me. 
But I didn’t care. 

I was going to do what I thought was right. 

I was going to set the mermaid free. 



17 


My hand trembled as I reached up to unlatch the screen at the top of the tank. 
The tank was taller than I was. I wasn’t quite sure how I’d get the mermaid out 
of there. But I had to find a way. 

As I struggled to pull the screen off, the mermaid began to squeal, “Eeee! 
EEEEEE!” 

“Sshh! Don’t make any noise!” I warned her. 

Then I felt a hand grab me by the arm. I gasped, startled. 

A deep voice asked, “What are you doing?” 

I turned around to see Alexander standing behind me. 

I stepped away from the tank, and he let go of my arm. 

“Billy, what were you doing?” he asked again. 

“I was going to let her go!” I cried. “Alexander, you can’t keep her in there! 
Look how unhappy she is!” 

We both stared at the mermaid, who had slumped to the bottom of the tank 
again. I think she knew that I had tried to help her—and that I had been stopped. 

I caught the sadness on Alexander’s face. I could tell he felt sorry for her. 
But he had a job to do. 

He turned to me and put an arm around my shoulders. “Billy, you’ve got to 
understand how important this mermaid is to your uncle,” he said. “He’s worked 
his whole life for a discovery like this. It would break his heart if you let her go.” 

He slowly led me away from the tank. I turned back to look at the mermaid 
again. 

“But what about her heart?” I asked. “I think it’s breaking her heart to be 
stuck in that fish tank.” 

Alexander sighed. “It’s not ideal, I know that. But it’s only temporary. Soon 
she’ll have plenty of room to swim and play in.” 

Sure, I thought bitterly. As an exhibit at the zoo, with millions of people 
gawking at her every day. 

Alexander removed his arm from my shoulders and rubbed his chin. 

“Your uncle is a very caring man, Billy,” he said. “He’ll do his best to make 
sure the mermaid has everything she needs. But it’s his duty to study her. The 
things he can learn from her could help people understand the oceans better— 



and take better care of them. That’s important, right?” 

“I guess so,” I said. 

I knew Alexander had a good point. I loved Dr. D., and I didn’t want to 
spoil his big discovery. 

But, still, the mermaid shouldn’t have to suffer for science, I thought. 

“Come on, Billy,” Alexander said, leading me below deck. “I promised you 
I’d show you how the sonar probes work, didn’t I? Let’s go down to the lab, and 
I’ll give you a demonstration.” 

As we started to climb below, I took one last glance back at the mermaid. 
She was still slumped forlornly at the bottom of the tank. Her head was lowered, 
her blond hair floating limply above it like seaweed. 

The sonar probes weren’t as interesting as I thought they’d be. All they did was 
beep whenever the Cassandra was in danger of running ashore. 

I guess Alexander could tell my mind was not on the sonar probes. “Want 
some lunch?” he asked me. 

Uh-oh. Lunch. I was hungry. But not for spicy chicken salad. 

I hesitated. “Well, I had a big breakfast....” 

“I’ll whip up something special,” Alexander offered. “We can have a picnic 
up on deck with the mermaid. Come on.” 

What could I do? I followed him to the kitchen. 

He opened the small refrigerator and pulled out a bowl. 

“This has been marinating all morning,” he said. 

I looked into the bowl. It was full of thin strips of something white and 
mbbery-looking. They floated in an oily, dark gray liquid. 

Whatever it was, I knew I couldn’t eat it. 

“It’s marinated squid,” said Alexander. “I added some squid ink for extra 
flavor. That’s what makes it gray.” 

“Yum,” I said, rolling my eyes. “I haven’t had squid ink in days!” 

“Don’t be so sarcastic. You might be surprised,” Alexander replied. He 
handed me the bowl. “Take this up on deck. I’ll bring some bread and iced tea.” 

I carried the bowl of squid up and set it down near the mermaid’s tank. 

“How are you doing, Mermaid?” I asked her. 

She flipped her tail a little. Then she opened and closed her mouth, as if she 
were chewing. 

“Hey,” I said. “You are hungry, aren’t you?” 



She kept making that chewing motion. I glanced down at the bowl of squid. 
Who knows? I thought. This might be just what she’d like. 

I stood on a rail and unlatched the top of the tank. Then I dropped in a piece 
of the rubbery squid. 

The mermaid leaped toward it and caught it in her mouth. 

She chewed, then smiled. 

She liked it! 

I gave her some more. She ate it. 

I rubbed my stomach. “Do you like it?” I asked her. I nodded yes. 

She smiled again. Then she nodded yes. 

She understood me! 

“What are you doing, Billy?” Alexander asked. He had come up on deck 
carrying two plates and a loaf of bread. 

“Alexander, look!” I cried. “We communicated!” 

I dropped another piece of squid into the tank. She ate it. Then she nodded 

yes. 

“That means she likes it!” I said. 

“Wow,” murmured Alexander. He put down the plates and picked up his 
notebook. He scribbled some notes. 

“Isn’t that way cool?” I demanded. “I’m a scientist, too—aren’t I, 
Alexander?” 

He nodded, but kept writing. 

“I mean, I’m the first person on Earth to communicate with a mermaid— 
right?” I insisted. 

“If she stays with us long enough, you might be able to talk to her in sign 
language,” he said. “Just think of the things we could learn!” 

He spoke aloud as he wrote, “Likes to eat squid.” Then he put down his 
pencil and said, “Hey, wait! That’s our lunch!” 

Uh-oh, I thought. I hope his feelings aren’t hurt. 

He looked at me. He looked at the bowl. He looked at the mermaid. 

Then he started laughing. 

“At least somebody around here likes my cooking!” he exclaimed. 

About an hour later, Dr. D. returned with the groceries and supplies. Luckily he 
had bought plenty of seafood in Santa Anita. We fed some of it to the mermaid 
for supper. While she ate, Dr. D. checked the readings on the meters Alexander 



had set up in the tank. 

“Interesting,” Dr. D. commented. “She sends out sonar signals through the 
water. Just as whales do.” 

“What does that mean?” asked Sheena. 

“It means there are probably other mermaids like her,” said Dr. D. “She 
must be trying to contact them with underwater sounds.” 

Poor mermaid, I thought. She’s calling to her friends. She wants to be 
rescued. 

I went to my cabin after supper and stared out of the little porthole. 

An orange sun sank slowly into the purple horizon. A wide carpet of gold 
light shimmered in the rolling ocean waters. A cool breeze blew in through the 
porthole. 

I watched the sun drop into the ocean. The sky immediately darkened, as if 
someone had turned off a lamp. 

The mermaid is up there all alone, I thought. She must be so frightened. A 
prisoner. Trapped in a fish tank in the dark. 

The door to my cabin suddenly burst open. Sheena bounded in, panting, her 
eyes wide. 

“Sheena!” I scolded angrily. “How many times do I have to tell you to 
knock first?” 

She ignored me. “But, Billy!” she gasped. “She’s escaped! The mermaid 
escaped!” 



18 


I leaped off my bed, my heart pounding. 

“She’s not there!” Sheena cried. “She’s not in her tank!” 

I darted out of the cabin, up the hatch, and out on deck. 

Part of me hoped she really had escaped to freedom. But part of me wished 
she could stay forever—and make my uncle the most famous scientist in the 
world and me the most famous nephew of a scientist! 

Please let her be okay, I thought. 

Up on deck, my eyes adjusted to the evening darkness. Tiny lights glowed 
all around the edge of the boat. 

I squinted across the deck at the giant fish tank. 

I ran so fast, I nearly toppled overboard. Sheena was right behind me. 

“Hey—!” I cried out when I saw the mermaid floating listlessly in the 
water, her green tail shimmering faintly in the fading light. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that Sheena was laughing. “Gotcha!” 
she shouted gleefully. “Gotcha again, Billy!” 

I groaned long and loud. Another one of Sheena’s stupid tricks. 

“Good one, Sheena,” I said bitterly. “Very clever.” 

“You’re just mad because I fooled you again. You’re so easy to trick.” 

The mermaid raised her eyes to me, and a faint smile formed on her pale 
lips. “Looorrrooo, looorrrooo,” she cooed at me. 

“She really is pretty,” Sheena said. 

The mermaid is hoping I’ll let her go now, I thought. Maybe I should.... 

Sheena could help me, I decided. It would be easier with two of us. 

But would my sister cooperate? “Sheena—”1 began. 

I heard footsteps behind us. “Hey, kids.” It was Dr. D. “It’s almost 
bedtime,” he called. “Ready to go below?” 

“We never go to bed this early at home,” Sheena whined. 

“Maybe not. But I bet you don’t get up so early at home, either. Do you?” 

Sheena shook her head. We all stood at the tank and watched the mermaid 
in silence. She gave her tail a little flick and settled back down at the bottom of 
the tank. 



“Don’t worry about her,” Dr. D. said. “I’ll check on her during the night to 
make sure she’s all right.” 

The mermaid pressed her tiny hands against the glass wall of the tank. Her 
eyes pleaded with us, pleaded with us to set her free. 

“She’ll feel better once she gets to Marina Zoo,” Dr. D. said. “They’re 
building a special lagoon just for her, with a reef and everything. It’ll be exactly 
like the lagoon off Ilandra. She’ll be free to swim and play. She’ll feel at home.” 

I hope so, I thought. But I didn’t feel so sure. 

The Cassandra rocked gently on the waves that night, but I couldn’t fall asleep. 

I lay on my bunk, staring at the ceiling. A pale beam of moonlight fell 
through the porthole and across my face. I couldn’t stop thinking about the 
mermaid. 

I tried to imagine what it would feel like to be trapped in a glass tank for a 
whole day. It probably wouldn’t be that different from being trapped in this tiny 
cabin, I thought, glancing around. My cabin was about as big as a closet. 

It would be terrible, I thought, fiddling with the collar of my pajama top. I 
pushed open the porthole to let in more air. 

The fish tank might not even be the worst of it, I figured. I know Dr. D. 
cares about the mermaid. I know he’d never hurt her. 

But what will happen to her when the zoo people take her away? Who will 
look out for her? 

Sure, they’re building a fancy fake lagoon. But it won’t be the same as the 
real lagoon. And there will be people around, staring at her all the time. They’ll 
probably expect her to perform tricks or something; maybe jump through hoops 
like a trained seal. 

They’ll probably put her in TV commercials, too. And TV shows and 
movies. 

She’ll be a prisoner. A lonely prisoner for the rest of her life. 

This is all my fault. How could I let this happen? 

I have to do something, I decided. I can’t let them take her. 

Just then I thought I heard something—a low hum. I lay very still and 
listened. At first I thought it was the mermaid. But I quickly realized it was a 
motor. 

I heard it chugging softly, from a distance. But slowly the sound moved 
closer. 



A boat. 

I sat up and peered out of the porthole. A large boat pulled quietly up beside 
the Cassandra. 

Who was it? The zoo people? 

In the middle of the night? 

No. It wasn’t the same boat. This boat was much bigger. 

As I peered out the small porthole, I saw two dark figures quietly slip on 
board the Cassandra. Then two more. 

My heart began to race. Who are these people? I wondered. What are they 
doing? 

What should I do? 

Should I sneak up and spy on them? What if they see me? 

Then I heard more strange noises. 

A thud. A muffled cry of pain. 

It came from the deck. 

The deck. Where the mermaid was trapped helplessly in her tank. 

Oh, no! I thought, feeling a chill of panic. They’re hurting the mermaid! 



19 


I charged up to the deck. Sheena ran right behind me. 

Stumbling over a tow rope, I grabbed the rail to steady myself. Then I 
darted blindly to the fish tank. 

The mermaid huddled at the bottom of the tank, her arms wrapped 
protectively around herself. 

I saw four men standing tensely near the tank. All four were dressed in 
black. They had black masks pulled over their faces. 

One of the men held a small club in his hand. 

And a body lay sprawled on the deck, face down. 

Dr. D.! 

Sheena screamed and ran to our uncle. She knelt beside him. “They hit him 
on the head!” she cried. “They knocked him out!” 

I gasped. “Who are you?” I demanded. “What are you doing on our boat?” 

The four men ignored me. 

Two of them unfolded a heavy rope net and spread it over the fish tank. 
Then they let it fall into the tank, draping it over the mermaid. 

“Stop it!” I yelled. “What are you doing?” 

“Be quiet, kid,” the man with the club muttered. He raised the club 
menacingly. 

I watched helplessly as they tightened the net around the mermaid. 

They were kidnapping her! 

“Eeeee! EEEEEeeee!” she squealed in terror and started to thrash her arms, 
struggling to free herself from the heavy net. 

“Stop it! Leave her alone!” I cried. 

One of the men gave a low laugh. The other three still ignored me. 

Sheena was bent over Dr. D., frantically trying to wake him up. I ran to the 
hatch and shouted down into the cabin, “Alexander! Alexander! Help!” 

Alexander was big and strong—maybe strong enough to stop these men. 

I ran back to the tank. The mermaid was trapped in the net. All four men 
worked to lift her out of the tank. She squirmed and fought with all her strength. 

“EEEEEE!” she screamed. The high-pitched squeal hurt my ears. 



“Can’t you get her to shut up?” one of the men cried angrily. 

“Just load her on board,” the one with the club replied sharply. 

“Stop!” I yelled. “You can’t do that!” 

Then I totally lost it. 

Without thinking, I dove toward the four of them. I don’t know what I 
planned to do. I just knew I had to stop them. 

One of them pushed me away easily with one hand. “Stay away—or you’ll 
get hurt,” he muttered. 

“Let her go! Let the mermaid go!” I cried frantically. 

“Forget about the mermaid,” said the man. “You’ll never see her again.” 

I grabbed the rail. My heart was pounding in my chest. I gasped for breath. 

I couldn’t stand the mermaid’s terrified screams. 

I couldn’t let them take her—not without a fight. 

She had saved my life once. Now it was my turn to save hers. 

But what could I do? 

They had lifted the mermaid out of the tank. Three men held her in the net. 
She squirmed and thrashed like crazy, splashing water all over the deck. 

I’ll tackle them, I thought. I’ll knock them over. Then I’ll push the mermaid 
into the ocean and she can swim away to safety. 

Lowering my head like a football player, I took a deep breath and ran right 
at them. 



20 


“Billy—stop!” Sheena screamed. 

I crashed into one of the men holding the net, butting him hard in the 
stomach with my head. 

To my dismay, the man hardly moved. 

He grabbed me with his free hand, lifted me up off the deck, and heaved me 
into the fish tank. 

I splashed into the warm water and came up, choking and sputtering. 

Through the glass, I watched the men toss the mermaid aboard their boat. 
They were getting away! 

I tried to scramble out of the tank, but it was too tall. I kept slipping down 
the wet glass, unable to reach the top. 

I knew there was only one person who could stop the masked men now. 
Alexander. 

Where was he? Hadn’t he heard all the noise? 

“ALEXANDER!” I shouted as loud as I could. But my voice was muffled 
by the glass walls of the tank. 

Then, finally, he appeared on the deck. I saw his big blond head and 
muscular body moving toward me. At last! 

“Alexander!” I cried, scrambling to stay afloat in the tank. “Stop them!” 

I could hear the motor of the other boat begin to rumble. One by one, the 
masked men lowered themselves off our boat. 

Three of them had left the Cassandra. Only one remained on deck. 

Through the glass I watched Alexander run up to him and grab his shoulder. 

Yes! I thought. Get him, Alexander! Get him! 

I’d never seen Alexander hit anyone before. But I knew he could do it if he 
had to. 

But Alexander didn’t hit the masked man. Instead, he asked, “Is the 
mermaid safely on board?” 

The masked man nodded. 

“Good,” Alexander replied. “And have you got the money for me?” 

“Got it.” 



“All right,” Alexander murmured. “Let’s get out of here!” 



21 


I nearly choked on a mouthful of water. 

I just couldn’t believe that Alexander was working with the masked men. 
He had seemed like such a good guy. 

But I knew now that he had arranged the whole thing. He had to be the one 
who had told them the mermaid was on board our boat. 

“Alexander,” I cried, “how could you?” 

He stared at me through the glass. “Hey, Billy, it’s just business,” he said 
with a shrug. “The zoo was going to pay a million dollars for the mermaid. But 
my new bosses will pay twenty million!” A thin smile crossed his face. “You 
know arithmetic, Billy. Which would you choose?” 

“You rat!” I shouted. I wanted to punch him. I stmggled to get out of the 
tank. All I managed to do was splash a lot and get water up my nose. 

Alexander followed the masked man to his boat. I pounded helplessly on 
the glass tank. 

Then I saw Sheena stand up. Lowering my gaze to the deck, I saw that Dr. 
D. was moving. 

Alexander didn’t seem to notice. He stepped over Dr. D.’s body. He didn’t 
even care that Dr. D. could have been hurt badly. 

I watched my uncle reach up and grab Alexander by the ankle. 

“Whoa!” Alexander tripped and fell hard onto his elbows and his knees. 

Sheena screamed and backed up to the rail. 

Maybe there’s still hope, I thought, my heart beating faster. Maybe they 
won’t get away after all. 

Alexander sat up, dazed, rubbing one elbow. “Get them!” he shouted down 
to the masked men. 

Two of the men climbed back aboard the Cassandra and grabbed Dr. D. 
Sheena ran at them, flailing at them with her puny little fists. 

Of course that didn’t do any good. The third masked man grabbed her arms 
and pinned them behind her back. 

“Kick him, Sheena!” I yelled through the glass. 

She tried to kick the man who held her, but he just tightened his grip. She 
couldn’t move. 



“Let them go!” I screamed desperately. 

“What should we do with them?” asked one of the men. 

“Whatever you do, do it quickly,” said Alexander. “We’ve got to get out of 
here.” 

The man who held Sheena glanced in at me. I was frantically treading 
water, trying to stay above the surface. 

“They might call the island police or the Coast Guard,” he said, frowning. 
“We’d better kill them.” 

“Throw them all in the tank!” suggested one of his partners. 



22 


“Alexander!” Dr. D. shouted. “I know you’re not a cruel man. Don’t let them do 
this.” 

Alexander avoided my uncle’s hard stare. “Sorry, Dr. D.,” he muttered. “I 
can’t stop them. If I try to, they’ll kill me, too.” 

Without another word, he lowered himself onto the other boat. 

What a creep, I thought angrily. 

Two of the masked men lifted Dr. D. up high and dropped him into the tank. 
He landed beside me with a splash. 

“Are you okay?” I asked him. 

He rubbed the back of his head and nodded. 

Sheena was next. They tossed her in easily. She flew through the air, 
flailing her arms and legs. Then she plopped into the water. 

The men replaced the screen lid. They clamped it shut. 

I stared out at them, realizing in horror that we had no way to escape. 

The water in the tank was about six feet deep. We all kicked and paddled, 
trying to stay above the surface. There was barely enough room for the three of 
us. 

“All right,” said one of the men. “Let’s go.” 

“Wait!” Dr. D. shouted. “You can’t just leave us here!” 

The three men exchanged glances. “You’re right. We can’t,” said one. 

They stepped toward us. 

So they aren’t heartless monsters after all, I thought. They weren’t going to 
leave us. 

But what were they going to do? 

The first man signaled the other two. They raised their hands to one side of 
the tank. 

“One, two, three—” the first man called out. 

On three, they pushed the tank over the side of the deck. 

We were thrown together. Then our bodies slammed against the side of the 
tank as it dropped into the ocean. 

Ocean water seeped into the tank. 



“The tank—it’s sinking!” cried Dr. D. 

We watched the kidnappers’ boat as it roared away. Our tank rocked in its 
wake. Then it started to sink. 

“We’re going under!” Sheena screamed. “We’re going to drown!” 



23 


All three of us desperately pushed against the screen. I beat my fists against it. 
Dr. D. tried to get his shoulder against it. 

But the tank tilted in the water, and we were all tossed back. 

The screen was made of heavy steel mesh, and clamped onto the top of the 
tank. We couldn’t reach the clamps from inside, so we had to try to break 
through it. 

We pushed with all our strength. It wouldn’t budge. 

The tank slowly sank deeper below the surface of the dark, rolling water. 
The moon disappeared behind a blanket of clouds, leaving us in total darkness. 

We had only a minute or two before the tank dropped completely below the 
surface. 

Sheena started to cry. “I’m so afraid!” she shrieked. “I’m so afraid!” 

Dr. D. pounded his fists against the glass tank wall, trying to break through. 

I ran my hands all along the top of the tank, looking for a weak spot in the 
screen. 

Then I hit something. 

A tiny latch. 

“Look!” I cried, pointing to the latch. 

I fumbled with it, trying to open it. “It’s stuck!” 

“Let me try.” Dr. D. tore at the latch with his fingers. “It’s jammed shut,” he 

said. 

Sheena took a red barrette from her hair. “Maybe we can loosen it with 
this,” she said. 

Dr. D. took the barrette and scraped hard around the latch. 

“It’s working!” he said. 

Maybe there’s hope, I thought. Maybe we’ll get out of here! 

Dr. D. stopped scraping and tugged at the latch. 

It moved! 

It opened! 

“We’re free!” cried Sheena. 

We all pushed at the screen. We pushed again. 



“Come on, kids, push harder,” urged Dr. D. 

We pushed again. The screen didn’t move. The latch hadn’t opened it after 
all. Two other latches held the screen in place. 

Two latches we couldn’t reach. 

We all grew silent. The only sounds now were Sheena’s soft, frightened 
sobs and the steady wash of the waves. 

The water had risen nearly to the top of the tank. Soon it would come 
mshing in on us. 

Suddenly, the ocean darkened. The waters grew choppy, and the tank 
rocked a little faster. 

“What’s that noise?” Sheena asked. 

I listened. 

Through the churning of the water, I heard a strange sound. It was very 
faint, as if coming from far away. 

A shrill, high-pitched whistle. 

“It sounds like a siren,” Dr. D. murmured. “Lots of sirens.” 

The eerie wails rose and fell over the water. 

Louder. Closer. 

The sound—as shrill as the screech of metal—surrounded us. 

Suddenly, dark, shadowy forms swirled around the tank. 

We pressed our faces to the glass. 

“That sound. I’ve never heard anything like it. What can it be?” asked Dr. 
D. 

“It—it’s coming from all around!” I stammered. 

The dark water tossed, churned by the shadowy forms. I peered through the 
foam, straining to see. 

Suddenly, out of the murky water, a face appeared. It pressed itself against 
the glass, right in front of my face! 

I gasped and pulled back. 

Then I saw more faces. We were surrounded by small, girlish faces. Their 
wide eyes peered in at us menacingly. 

“Mermaids!” I shrieked. 

“Dozens of them!” Dr. D. murmured in hushed amazement. 

They churned the water with their long tails. 

Their hair, dark tangles in the black water, floated around their faces. The 
tank rocked harder and harder. 



“What do they want?” cried Sheena, her voice shrill and trembling. 

“They look angry,” Dr. D. whispered. 

I stared out at the mermaids, swirling around us like ghosts. They reached 
out their hands and began clutching at the tank. They smacked their tails on the 
water. The dark waters tossed and churned. 

Suddenly I knew. I knew what they wanted. 

“Revenge,” I murmured. “They’ve come for revenge. We took their friend. 
And now they’re going to pay us back.” 



24 


Shadowy hands pressed against the glass. 

“They’re pulling us under!” Dr. D. cried. 

I gasped in terror, staring out at the hands, black outlines against the glass. 
Then, suddenly, the tank began to rise. Up out of the water, higher and 
higher. 

“Huh? What’s happening?” asked Sheena. 

“They—they’re pushing us back up!” I cried happily. 

“The mermaids aren’t taking revenge—they’re saving us!” Dr. D. 
exclaimed. 

The tank brushed up against the Cassandra. I could see the mermaids’ tiny 
hands working above us. 

The clamps popped open. The screen was pulled off. 

With a happy groan, Dr. D. boosted Sheena up. She scrambled on board the 

boat. 

Then I climbed aboard, and we both helped pull Dr. D. out of the tank. 

We were drenched, shivering from the cold. But we were safe. 

The mermaids swarmed around the boat, their pale eyes peering up at us. 
“Thank you,” Dr. D. called down to them. “Thank you for saving our lives.” 
I realized this was the second time a mermaid had saved my life. I owed 
them more than ever now. 

“We’ve got to get the kidnapped mermaid back,” I said. “Who knows what 
Alexander and those creeps will do to her!” 

“Yeah,” cried Sheena. “Look what they tried to do to us!” 

“I wish we could rescue her,” Dr. D. murmured, shaking his head. “But I 
don’t see how we can. How will we find the kidnappers’ boat in the dark? 
They’re long gone by now.” 

But I knew there had to be a way. I leaned over the rail, peering down at the 
mermaids floating beside us, chattering and cooing in the moonlight. 

“Help us!” I pleaded with them. “We want to find your friend. Please—can 
you take us to her?” 

I held my breath and waited. Would the mermaids understand me? Would 



they be able to help us—somehow? 

The mermaids chattered and whistled to one another. Then one of them—a 
dark-haired mermaid with an extra-long tail—moved to the head of the group. 

She began whistling and clicking to the other mermaids. She seemed to be 
giving orders. 

The three of us stared in amazement as the mermaids began to form a long 
line, one mermaid after the other, stretching far out to sea. 

“Do you think they’re going to lead us to the kidnappers?” I asked. 

“Maybe,” Dr. D. replied thoughtfully. “But how will the mermaids find the 
boat?” He rubbed his chin. “I know. I’ll bet they’ll use their sonar. I wish I had 
time to really listen to those sounds they’re making—” 

“Look, Dr. D!” Sheena interrupted. “The mermaids are swimming away!” 

We watched the dark figures slide away through the rolling black waters. 

“Quick!” I cried. “We’ve got to follow them.” 

“Too dangerous,” Dr. D. replied, sighing. “We can’t fight Alexander and 
four big masked men by ourselves!” 

He paced back and forth on the narrow deck. “We should call the island 
police,” he said finally. “But what would we say? That we’re chasing after a 
kidnapped mermaid? No one would believe us.” 

“Dr. D., we have to follow them. Please!” I pleaded. “The mermaids are 
swimming out of sight!” 

He stared at me for a long moment. “Okay. Let’s get going,” he said finally. 

I hurried to the stern to untie the dinghy. Dr. D. dropped it into the water 
and jumped in. Sheena and I followed. Dr. D. started the motor—and we raced 
after the shimmering line of mermaids. 

The mermaids glided so quickly through the rolling waters, it was hard for 
the small boat to keep up with them. 

About fifteen or twenty minutes later, we found ourselves in a small, 
deserted cove. The moon drifted out of the clouds. It cast pale light on a dark 
boat anchored near the shore. 

Dr. D. cut the motor so the kidnappers wouldn’t hear us approaching. 

“They must be asleep,” he whispered. 

“How can Alexander sleep after what he did to us?” said Sheena. “He left 
us to drown!” 

“Money can make people do terrible things,” Dr. D. replied sadly. “But it’s 
good they think we’re dead. They won’t be expecting us.” 



“But where’s the mermaid?” I whispered, staring at the dark boat, bobbing 
gently under the misty moonlight. 

We drifted silently toward the darkened boat. 

Well, we’ve found the kidnappers, I thought, holding on to the side of the 
dinghy as we drew near. 

There’s just one problem. 

What do we do next? 



25 


The air became very still. The kidnappers’ boat sat gently on the calm, glassy 
waters of the cove. 

“What happened to all the mermaids?” Sheena whispered. 

I shrugged. There was no sign of them. I imagined them swimming way 
down below the surface, hiding. 

Suddenly, at the side of the kidnappers’ boat, I saw ripples in the water. 

Slowly, silently, our dinghy glided toward the boat. I stared at the ripples, 
trying to see what was making them. Then I saw a flash of blond hair in the 
moonlight. 

“The mermaid!” I whispered. “There she is!” 

She was floating in the water, tied to the back of the kidnappers’ boat. 

“They must not have a tank to keep her in,” Dr. D. whispered excitedly. 
“Lucky for us.” 

Suddenly, we saw other figures rippling the water. Mermaids arched up, 
circling the captured mermaid. I saw tail fins raised like giant fans. I saw hands 
reach around the mermaid, hands tugging at the rope that held her. 

The waters tossed quietly as the figures worked. 

“The mermaids are setting her free,” I whispered. 

“What are we going to do?” Sheena asked. 

“We’ll just make sure she gets away safely,” Dr. D. replied. “Then we’ll slip 
away. The kidnappers will never know we were here.” 

We watched the mermaids struggle with the rope as our dinghy washed up 
against the kidnappers’ boat. 

“Come on, mermaids!” Sheena urged under her breath. “Hurry!” 

“Maybe they need some help,” I said. 

Dr. D. began to steer toward the mermaids. 

I gasped as a light flared on the kidnappers’ boat. A match set flame to a 
torch. 

An angry voice boomed, “What do you think you’re doing?” 



26 


I ducked away as the flaming torch was thrust in my face. 

Behind the torch, I could see the kidnapper glaring down at me. He had 
quickly pulled on his black mask. It covered only the top of his face. 

I heard a clambering sound, cries of surprise. Alexander and the other three 
kidnappers appeared on the deck. 

“How did you get here?” demanded the man with the torch. “Why aren’t 
you dead?” 

“We’ve come for the mermaid,” Dr. D. called up to him. “You can’t keep 
her here!” 

The torch swung past my head. I stood up in the dinghy and took a swipe at 
it, trying to knock it into the water. 

“Billy, no!” cried Dr. D. 

The kidnapper pulled the torch away. I fell forward in the dinghy, toppling 
over on Sheena. 

“Give us back the mermaid!” Dr. D. demanded. 

“Finders, keepers,” the kidnapper muttered. “You’ve made a long trip for 
nothing. And now look—your boat is on fire.” 

He lowered the torch to the dinghy and set it aflame. 



27 


The flames flared up, bright orange and yellow against the blue-black sky. They 
spread quickly across the front of the dinghy. 

Sheena uttered a terrified scream and tried to back away from the flames. 

In a panic, she started to leap into the water—but Dr. D. pulled her back. 
“Don’t leave the boat! You’ll drown!” 

The fire crackled. The bright flames shot higher. 

Dr. D. grabbed a yellow life jacket from the bottom of the dinghy and 
started frantically beating out the fire. 

“Billy—get a life jacket!” he yelled. “Sheena—find the bucket. Throw 
water on the flames—hurry!” 

I found a life jacket and beat at the flames. Sheena dumped seawater on 
them as fast as she could. 

Over the crackling flames, I heard Alexander shout, “Get the mermaid 
aboard. Let’s get out of here!” 

“Dr. D.!” I cried. “They’re getting away!” 

Then I heard the kidnappers yelling. “The mermaid! Where’s the 
mermaid?” 

I turned to the side of the boat. The mermaid was gone. Her friends had 
freed her. 

One of the kidnappers reached down from his boat and grabbed me. “What 
did you do with the mermaid?” he demanded. 

“Let him go!” shouted Dr. D. 

I tried to squirm away from the kidnapper. He held me tight. Then I saw 
another kidnapper swing a club at Dr. D.’s head. 

Dr. D. dodged the club. The kidnapper tried to hit him in the stomach. Dr. 
D. dodged again. 

I kicked and squirmed. Sheena tugged at the kidnapper’s hands, trying to 
help me escape. 

The third kidnapper picked her up by the wrists and threw her to the floor 
of the dinghy. 

“Let go of the kids!” pleaded Dr. D. “Alexander! Help us!” 

Alexander didn’t move from his spot on the deck. He stood with his brawny 



arms crossed in front of him, calmly watching the fight. 

The flames had nearly been quenched, but they suddenly flared up again. 

“Sheena—the fire!” I cried. “Put out the fire!” 

She grabbed the bucket and poured seawater everywhere. 

One of the kidnappers kicked the bucket from her hands. It landed in the 
water with a splash. 

Sheena picked up a life jacket and beat the last of the flames out. 

“Drop down into their boat and toss them in the water!” I heard a kidnapper 
shout up above. 

A man started to lower himself to our dinghy. But suddenly he lurched 
forward, his arms flailing. He let out a cry of surprise as his boat began to rock 
violently to the left. It looked as if it had been slammed by a huge wave. 

The kidnappers cried out as their boat began to rock back and forth. Slowly 
at first. Then violently. Gripping the sides of the dinghy, I watched them clinging 
to the rail, screaming in confusion and surprise. 

Dr. D. slowly stood up, trying to see what was happening. 

The boat tossed violently, as if bucking tall waves. 

The mermaids. I could see them now. 

They had surrounded the kidnappers’ ship and were rocking it hard. 

Hard. Harder. The kidnappers hung on helplessly. 

“Mission accomplished!” Dr. D. cried happily. He started up the motor and 
we roared off. 

Turning back, I could see the boat tilting and rocking in the water. And I 
could see our mermaid swimming free, behind the other mermaids in the 
shimmering waves. 

“She got away!” I cried. “She’s free!” 

“I hope she’ll be all right,” said Sheena. 

“We’ll look for her tomorrow,” said Dr. D. as he steered us back to the sea 
lab. “We know where to find her now.” 

Sheena glanced at me. I glanced back. 

Oh, no, I thought. After all this, it can’t be true. 

Is Dr. D. going to catch the mermaid again—and give her to the zoo? 

Sheena and I met in the galley the next morning. Since Alexander was gone, we 
had to fix our own breakfasts. 

“Do you think the mermaid went back to the lagoon?” asked Sheena. 



“Probably,” I replied. “That’s where she lives.” 

She spooned some cereal into her mouth and chewed with a thoughtful look 
on her face. 

“Sheena,” I said, “if someone gave you a million dollars, would you show 
them where the mermaid lives?” 

“No,” Sheena replied. “Not if they wanted to capture her.” 

“Me, neither,” I said. “That’s what I don’t get. Dr. D. is a great guy. I just 
can’t believe he’d—” 

I stopped. I heard a noise. The sound of a motor. 

Sheena listened. She heard it, too. 

We dropped our spoons and ran up on deck. 

Dr. D. was standing on the deck, staring out to sea. 

A boat was approaching. A white boat with Marina Zoo stenciled on the 
side in large letters. 

“The zoo people!” I said to Sheena. “They’re here!” 

What would our uncle do? I wondered with growing dread. Would he tell 
them where the mermaid was? Would he accept the million dollars? 

Sheena and I ducked behind the cockpit. We watched the Marina Zoo boat 
tie up beside the Cassandra. I recognized Mr. Showalter and Ms. Wickman. 

Mr. Showalter tossed a rope to Dr. D. Ms. Wickman jumped aboard. 

The zoo people smiled and shook Dr. D.’s hand. He nodded at them 
solemnly. 

“We had word from the fishermen on Santa Anita that you found the 
mermaid,” Mr. Showalter said. “We’re ready to take her with us now.” 

Ms. Wickman opened her briefcase and pulled out a slender envelope. 
“Here is a check for one million dollars, Dr. Deep,” she said, smiling. “We’ve 
made it out to you and the Cassandra Research Lab.” 

She held out the check to my uncle. 

I peered out from behind the cockpit. Please don’t take it, Dr. D., I pleaded 
silently. Please don’t take the check. 

“Thank you very much,” my uncle said. He reached out a hand and took the 
check from her. 



28 


“A million dollars means a great deal to me and my work,” Dr. D. said. “Your 
zoo has been very generous. That’s why I’m sorry I have to do this.” 

He raised the envelope and tore it in half. 

The two zoo people gasped in surprise. 

“I can’t take the money,” Dr. D. said. 

“Just what are you saying, Dr. Deep?” Mr. Showalter demanded. 

“You sent me on a wild goose chase,” my uncle replied. “I have searched 
these waters thoroughly ever since you left. With my equipment, I searched 
every inch of the lagoon and all the surrounding waters. I am now more 
convinced than ever before that mermaids do not exist.” 

“Yaaaay!” I screamed to myself. I wanted to jump up and down and cheer 
my head off—but I stayed hidden with Sheena behind the cockpit. 

“But what about the fishermen’s stories?” Ms. Wickman protested. 

“The local fishermen have told mermaid stories for years,” Dr. D. told her. 
“I think they believe they’ve really seen mermaids rising through the mist on 
foggy days. But what they have seen are only fish, or dolphins, or manatees, or 
even swimmers. Because mermaids don’t exist. They’re fantasy creatures.” 

Mr. Showalter and Ms. Wickman both sighed in disappointment. 

“Are you sure about this?” Mr. Showalter asked. 

“Completely sure,” my uncle replied firmly. “My equipment is very 
sensitive. It can pick up the tiniest minnow.” 

“We respect your opinion, Dr. Deep,” Mr. Showalter said with some 
sadness. “You’re the leading expert on exotic sea creatures. That’s why we came 
to you in the first place.” 

“Thank you,” said Dr. D. “Then I hope you’ll take my advice and drop your 
hunt for a mermaid.” 

“I guess we’ll have to,” said Ms. Wickman. “Thank you for trying, Dr. 
Deep.” 

They all shook hands. Then the zoo people got back on their boat and 
motored away. 

The coast was clear. Sheena and I came bursting out of our hiding place. 

“Dr. D.!” cried Sheena, throwing her arms around him. “You’re the 



greatest!” 

A wide grin spread over Dr. D.’s face. “Thanks, guys,” he said. “From now 
on, none of us will say anything to anyone about mermaids. Is it a deal?” 

“It’s a deal,” Sheena instantly agreed. 

“Deal,” I said. We all shook hands. The mermaid was our secret. 

I swore I’d never mention the mermaid to anyone. But I wanted to see her one 
last time. I wanted to say good-bye. 

After lunch, Sheena and Dr. D. went to their cabins to nap. We had been up 
for most of the night, after all. I pretended to take a nap, too. 

But once they were asleep, I sneaked out of my cabin and slipped into the 
bright blue water. 

I swam over to the lagoon to search for the mermaid. 

The sun was high in a pale blue sky. It glowed down on the still lagoon 
waters, making them glitter as if covered in gold. 

Mermaid? Where are you? I wondered. 

I was just past the reef when I felt a playful tug on my leg. 

Sheena? I thought. Had she followed me again ? 

I spun around to catch her. 

No one there. 

Seaweed, probably, I thought. I kept swimming. 

A few seconds later, I felt the tug again. Harder this time. 

Hey—it must be the mermaid! I told myself. 

I turned once again to search for her. 

The water rippled. “Mermaid?” I called. A head popped out of the water. A 
gigantic, slimy, dark green head. With one enormous eye. And a mouthful of 
jagged teeth. “The sea monster!” I shrieked. “The sea monster!” Would they 
believe me this time? 




THE SCARECROW 
WALKS AT MIDNIGHT 
Goosebumps - 20 
R.L. Stine 


1 


“Hey, Jodie—wait up!” 

I turned and squinted into the bright sunlight. My brother, Mark, was still 
on the concrete train platform. The train had clattered off. I could see it snaking 
its way through the low, green meadows in the distance. 

I turned to Stanley. Stanley is the hired man on my grandparents’ farm. He 
stood beside me, carrying both suitcases. “Look in the dictionary for the word 
‘slowpoke’,” I said, “and you’ll see Mark’s picture.” 

Stanley smiled at me. “I like the dictionary, Jodie,” he said. “Sometimes I 
read it for hours.” 

“Hey, Mark—get a move on!” I cried. But he was taking his good time, 
walking slowly, in a daze as usual. 

I tossed my blond hair behind my shoulders and turned back to Stanley. 
Mark and I hadn’t visited the farm for a year. But Stanley still looked the same. 

He’s so skinny. “Like a noodle”, my grandma always says. His denim 
overalls always look five sizes too big on him. 

Stanley is about forty or forty-five, I think. He wears his dark hair in a 
crewcut, shaved close to his head. His ears are huge. They stick way out and are 
always bright red. And he has big, round, brown eyes that remind me of puppy 
eyes. 

Stanley isn’t very smart. Grandpa Kurt always says that Stanley isn’t 
working with a full one hundred watts. 

But Mark and I really like him. He has a quiet sense of humor. And he is 
kind and gentle and friendly, and always has lots of amazing things to show us 
whenever we visit the farm. 

“You look nice, Jodie,” Stanley said, his cheeks turning as red as his ears. 
“How old are you now?” 

“Twelve,” I told him. “And Mark is eleven.” 

He thought about it. “That makes twenty-three,” he joked. 

We both laughed. You never know what Stanley is going to say! 

“I think I stepped in something gross,” Mark complained, catching up to us. 

I always know what Mark is going to say. My brother only knows three 
words— cool, weird, and gross. Really. That’s his whole vocabulary. 



As a joke, I gave him a dictionary for his last birthday. “You’re weird,” 
Mark said when I handed it to him. “What a gross gift.” 

He scraped his white high-tops on the ground as we followed Stanley to the 
beat-up, red pickup truck. “Carry my backpack for me,” Mark said, trying to 
shove the bulging backpack at me. 

“No way,” I told him. “Carry it yourself.” 

The backpack contained his Walkman, about thirty tapes, comic books, his 
Game Boy, and at least fifty game cartridges. I knew he planned to spend the 
whole month lying on the hammock on the screened-in back porch of the 
farmhouse, listening to music and playing video games. 

Well... no way! 

Mom and Dad said it was my job to make sure Mark got outside and 
enjoyed the farm. We were so cooped up in the city all year. That’s why they 
sent us to visit Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam for a month each summer— 
to enjoy the great outdoors. 

We stopped beside the truck while Stanley searched his overall pockets for 
the key. “It’s going to get pretty hot today,” Stanley said, “unless it cools down.” 

A typical Stanley weather report. 

I gazed out at the wide, grassy field beyond the small train station parking 
lot. Thousands of tiny white puffballs floated up against the clear blue sky. 

It was so beautiful! 

Naturally, I sneezed. 

I love visiting my grandparents’ farm. My only problem is, I’m allergic to 
just about everything on it. 

So Mom packs several bottles of my allergy medicine for me—and lots of 
tissues. 

“Gesundheit, ” Stanley said. He tossed our two suitcases in the back of the 
pickup. Mark slid his backpack in, too. “Can I ride in back?” he asked. 

He loves to lie flat in the back, staring up at the sky, and bumping up and 
down really hard. 

Stanley is a terrible driver. He can’t seem to concentrate on steering and 
driving at the right speed at the same time. So there are always lots of quick 
turns and heavy bumps. 

Mark lifted himself into the back of the pickup and stretched out next to the 
suitcases. I climbed beside Stanley in the front. 

A short while later, we were bouncing along the narrow, twisting road that 



led to the farm. I stared out the dusty window at the passing meadows and 
farmhouses. Everything looked so green and alive. 

Stanley drove with both hands wrapped tightly around the top of the 
steering wheel. He sat forward stiffly, leaning over the wheel, staring straight 
ahead through the windshield without blinking. 

“Mr. Mortimer doesn’t farm his place anymore,” he said, lifting one hand 
from the wheel to point to a big, white farmhouse on top of a sloping, green hill. 

“Why not?” I asked. 

“Because he died,” Stanley replied solemnly. 

See what I mean? You never know what Stanley is going to say. 

We bounced over a deep rut in the road. I was sure Mark was having a great 
time in back. 

The road leads through the small town, so small that it doesn’t even have a 
name. The farmers have always called it Town. 

It has a feed store, a combination gas station and grocery store, a white- 
steepled church, a hardware store, and a mailbox. 

There were two trucks parked in front of the feed store. I didn’t see anyone 
as we barreled past. 

My grandparents’ farm is about two miles from town. I recognized the 
cornfields as we approached. 

“The corn is so high already!” I exclaimed, staring through the bouncing 
window. “Have you eaten any yet?” 

“Just at dinner,” Stanley replied. 

Suddenly, he slowed the truck and turned his eyes to me. “The scarecrow 
walks at midnight,” he uttered in a low voice. 

“Huh?” I wasn’t sure I’d heard correctly. 

“The scarecrow walks at midnight,” he repeated, training his big puppy 
eyes on me. “I read it in the book.” 

I didn’t know what to say, so I laughed. I thought maybe he was making a 

joke. 


Days later, I realized it was no joke.

Watching the farm spread out in front of us filled me with happiness. It’s not a 
big farm or a fancy farm, but I like everything about it. 

I like the barn with its sweet smells. I like the low mooing sounds of the 
cows way off in the far pasture. I like to watch the tall stalks of corn, all swaying 
together in the wind. 

Corny, huh? 

I also like the scary ghost stories Grandpa Kurt tells us at night in front of 
the fireplace. 

And I have to include Grandma Miriam’s chocolate chip pancakes. They’re 
so good, I sometimes dream about them back home in the city. 

I also like the happy expressions on my grandparents’ faces when we come 
mshing up to greet them. 

Of course I was the first one out of the truck. Mark was as slow as usual. I 
went running up to the screen porch in back of their big, old farmhouse. I 
couldn’t wait to see my grandparents. 

Grandma Miriam came waddling out, her arms outstretched. The screen 
door slammed behind her. But then I saw Grandpa Kurt push it open and he 
hurried out, too. 

His limp was worse, I noticed right away. He leaned heavily on a white 
cane. He’d never needed one before. 

I didn’t have time to think about it as Mark and I were smothered in hugs. 
“So good to see you! It’s been so long, so long!” Grandma Miriam cried happily. 

There were the usual comments about how much taller we were and how 
grown up we looked. 

“Jodie, where’d you get that blond hair? There aren’t any blonds in my 
family,” Grandpa Kurt would say, shaking his mane of white hair. “You must get 
that from your father’s side. 

“No, I know. I bet you got it from a store,” he said, grinning. It was his little 
joke. He greeted me with it every summer. And his blue eyes would sparkle 
excitedly. 

“You’re right. It’s a wig,” I told him, laughing. 

He gave my long blond hair a playful tug. 



“Did you get cable yet?” Mark asked, dragging his backpack along the 
ground. 

“Cable TV?” Grandpa Kurt stared hard at Mark. “Not yet. But we still get 
three channels. How many more do we need?” 

Mark rolled his eyes. “No MTV,” he groaned. 

Stanley made his way past us, carrying our suitcases into the house. 

“Let’s go in. I’ll bet you’re starving,” Grandma Miriam said. “I made soup 
and sandwiches. We’ll have chicken and corn tonight. The corn is very sweet 
this year. I know how you two love it.” 

I watched my grandparents as they led the way to the house. They both 
looked older to me. They moved more slowly than I remembered. Grandpa 
Kurt’s limp was definitely worse. They both seemed tired. 

Grandma Miriam is short and chubby. She has a round face surrounded by 
curly red hair. Bright red. There’s no way to describe the color. I don’t know 
what she uses to dye it that color. I’ve never seen it on anyone else! 

She wears square-shaped eyeglasses that give her a really old-fashioned 
look. She likes big, roomy housedresses. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her in jeans 
or pants. 

Grandpa Kurt is tall and broad-shouldered. Mom says he was really 
handsome when he was young. “Like a movie star,” she always tells me. 

Now he has wavy, white hair, still very thick, that he wets and slicks down 
flat on his head. He has sparkling blue eyes that always make me smile. And a 
white stubble over his slender face. Grandpa Kurt doesn’t like to shave. 

Today he was wearing a long-sleeved, red-and-green-plaid shirt, buttoned to 
the collar despite the hot day, and baggy jeans, stained at one knee, held up by 
white suspenders. 

Lunch was fun. We sat around the long kitchen table. Sunlight poured in 
through the big window. I could see the barn in back and the cornfields 
stretching behind it. 

Mark and I told all our news—about school, about my basketball team 
going to the championships, about our new car, about Dad growing a mustache. 

For some reason, Stanley thought that was very funny. He was laughing so 
hard, he choked on his split-pea soup. And Grandpa Kurt had to reach over and 
slap him on the back. 

It’s hard to know what will crack Stanley up. As Mark would say, Stanley is 
definitely weird. 



All through lunch, I kept staring at my grandparents. I couldn’t get over 
how much they had changed in one year. They seemed so much quieter, so much 
slower. 

That’s what it means to get older, I told myself. 

“Stanley will have to show you his scarecrows,” Grandma Miriam said, 
passing the bowl of potato chips. “Won’t you, Stanley?” 

Grandpa Kurt cleared his throat loudly. I had the feeling he was telling 
Grandma Miriam to change the subject or something. 

“I made them,” Stanley said, grinning proudly. He turned his big eyes on 
me. “The book—it told me how.” 

“Are you still taking guitar lessons?” Grandpa Kurt asked Mark. 

I could see that, for some reason, Grandpa Kurt didn’t want to talk about 
Stanley’s scarecrows. 

“Yeah,” Mark answered with a mouthful of potato chips. “But I sold my 
acoustic. I switched to electric.” 

“You mean you have to plug it in?” Stanley asked. He started to giggle, as if 
he had just cracked a funny joke. 

“What a shame you didn’t bring your guitar,” Grandma Miriam said to 
Mark. 

“No, it isn’t,” I teased. “The cows would start giving sour milk!” 

“Shut up, Jodie!” Mark snapped. He has no sense of humor. 

“They already do give sour milk,” Grandpa Kurt muttered, lowering his 

eyes. 

“Bad luck. When cows give sour milk, it means bad luck,” Stanley 
declared, his eyes widening, his expression suddenly fearful. 

“It’s okay, Stanley,” Grandma Miriam assured him quickly, placing a hand 
gently on his shoulder. “Grandpa Kurt was only teasing.” 

“If you kids are finished, why not go with Stanley,” Grandpa Kurt said. 
“He’ll give you a tour of the farm. You always enjoy that.” He sighed. “I’d go 
along, but my leg—it’s been acting up again.” 

Grandma Miriam started to clear the dishes. Mark and I followed Stanley 
out the back door. The grass in the back yard had recently been mowed. The air 
was heavy with its sweet smell. 

I saw a hummingbird fluttering over the flower garden beside the house. I 
pointed it out to Mark, but by the time he turned, it had hummed away. 

At the back of the long, green yard stood the old barn. Its white walls were 



badly stained and peeling. It really needed a paint job. The doors were open, and 
I could see square bales of straw inside. 

Far to the right of the barn, almost to the cornfields, stood the small guest 
house where Stanley lived with his teenage son, Sticks. 

“Stanley—where’s Sticks?” I asked. “Why wasn’t he at lunch?” 

“Went to town,” Stanley answered quietly. “Went to town, riding on a 
pony.” 

Mark and I exchanged glances. We never can figure Stanley out. 

Poking up from the cornfield stood several dark figures, the scarecrows 
Grandma Miriam had started to talk about. I stared out at them, shielding my 
eyes from the sun with one hand. 

“So many scarecrows!” I exclaimed. “Stanley, last summer there was only 
one. Why are there so many now?” 

He didn’t reply. He didn’t seem to hear me. He had a black baseball cap 
pulled down low over his forehead. He was taking long strides, leaning forward 
with that storklike walk of his, his hands shoved into the pockets of his baggy 
denim overalls. 

“We’ve seen the farm a hundred times,” Mark complained, whispering to 
me. “Why do we have to take the grand tour again?” 

“Mark—cool your jets,” I told him. “We always take a tour of the farm. It’s 
a tradition.” 

Mark grumbled to himself. He really is lazy. He never wants to do anything. 

Stanley led the way past the barn into the cornfields. The stalks were way 
over my head. Their golden tassels gleamed in the bright sunlight. 

Stanley reached up and pulled an ear off the stalk. “Let’s see if it’s ready,” 
he said, grinning at Mark and me. 

He held the ear in his left hand and started to shuck it with his right. 

After a few seconds, he pulled the husk away, revealing the ear of corn 
inside. 

I stared at it—and let out a horrified cry. 



3 


“Ohhhh—it’s disgusting !” I shrieked. 

“Gross!” I heard Mark groan. 

The corn was a disgusting brown color. And it was moving on the cob. 
Wriggling. Squirming. 

Stanley raised the corn to his face to examine it. And I realized it was 
covered with worms. Hundreds of wriggling, brown worms. 

“No!” Stanley cried in horror. He let the ear of corn drop to the ground at 
his feet. “That’s bad luck! The book says so. That’s very bad luck!” 

I stared down at the ear of corn. The worms were wriggling off the cob, 
onto the dirt. 

“It’s okay, Stanley,” I told him. “I only screamed because I was surprised. 
This happens sometimes. Sometimes worms get into the corn. Grandpa told me.” 

“No. It’s bad,” Stanley insisted in a trembling voice. His red ears were 
aflame. His big eyes revealed his fear. “The book—it says so.” 

“What book?” Mark demanded. He kicked the wormy ear of corn away 
with the toe of his high-top. 

“My book,” Stanley replied mysteriously. “My superstition book.” 

Uh-oh, I thought. Stanley shouldn’t have a book about superstitions. He 
was already the most superstitious person in the world—even without a book! 

“You’ve been reading a book about superstitions?” Mark asked him, 
watching the brown worms crawl over the soft dirt. 

“Yes.” Stanley nodded his head enthusiastically. “It’s a good book. It tells 
me everything. And it’s all true. All of it!” 

He pulled off his cap and scratched his stubby hair. “I’ve got to check the 
book. I’ve got to see what to do about the corn. The bad corn.” 

He was getting pretty worked up. It was making me feel a little scared. I’ve 
known Stanley my whole life. I think he’s worked for Grandpa Kurt for more 
than twenty years. 

He’s always been strange. But I’ve never seen him get so upset about 
something as unimportant as a bad ear of corn. 

“Show us the scarecrows,” I said, trying to get his mind off the corn. 

“Yeah. Let’s see them,” Mark joined in. 



“Okay. The scarecrows.” Stanley nodded. Then he turned, still thinking 
hard, and began leading the way through the tall rows of cornstalks. 

The stalks creaked and groaned as we passed by them. It was kind of an 
eerie sound. 

Suddenly, a shadow fell over me. One of the dark scarecrows rose up in 
front of us. It wore a tattered black coat, stuffed with straw. Its arms stretched 
stiffly out at its sides. 

The scarecrow was tall, towering over my head. Tall enough to stand over 
the high cornstalks. 

Its head was a faded burlap bag, filled with straw. Evil black eyes and a 
menacing frown had been painted on thickly in black paint. A battered old- 
fashioned hat rested on its head. 

“You made these?” I asked Stanley. I could see several other scarecrows 
poking up from the corn. They all stood in the same stiff position. They all had 
the same menacing frown. 

He stared up the scarecrow’s face. “I made them,” he said in a low voice. 
“The book showed me how.” 

“They’re pretty scary looking,” Mark said, standing close beside me. He 
grabbed the scarecrow’s straw hand and shook it. “What’s up?” Mark asked it. 

“The scarecrow walks at midnight,” Stanley said, repeating the phrase he 
had used at the train station. 

Mark was trying to slap the scarecrow a high-five. 

“What does that mean?” I asked Stanley. 

“The book told me how,” Stanley replied, keeping his eyes on the dark- 
painted face on the burlap bag. “The book told me how to make them walk.” 

“Huh? You mean you make the scarecrows walk?” I asked, very confused. 

Stanley’s dark eyes locked on mine. Once again, he got that very solemn 
expression on his face. “I know how to do it. The book has all the words.” 

I stared back at him, totally confused. I didn’t know what to say. 

“I made them walk, Jodie,” Stanley continued in a voice just above a 
whisper. “I made them walk last week. And now I’m the boss.” 

“Huh? The boss of the s-scarecrows?” I stammered. “Do you mean—” 

I stopped when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the scarecrow’s arm 
move. 

The straw crinkled as the arm slid up. 

Then I felt rough straw brush against my face—as the dry scarecrow arm 



moved to my throat. 



4 


The prickly straw, poking out of the sleeve of the black coat, scraped against my 
neck. 

I let out a shrill scream. 

“It’s alivel” I cried in panic, diving to the ground, scrambling away on all 
fours. 

I turned back to see Mark and Stanley calmly watching me. 

Hadn’t they seen the scarecrow try to choke me? 

Then Stanley’s son, Sticks, stepped out from behind the scarecrow, a gleeful 
grin on his face. 

“Sticks—! You creep!” I cried angrily. I knew at once that he had moved 
the scarecrow’s arm. 

“You city kids sure scare easy,” Sticks said, his grin growing wider. He 
reached down to help me to my feet. “You really thought the scarecrow moved, 
didn’t you, Jodie?” he said accusingly. 

“I can make the scarecrows move,” Stanley said, pulling the cap down 
lower on his forehead. 

“I can make them walk. I did it. It’s all in the book.” 

Sticks’ smile faded. The light seemed to dim from his dark eyes. “Yeah, 
sure, Dad,” he murmured. 

Sticks is sixteen. He is tall and lanky. He has long, skinny arms and legs. 
That’s how he got the nickname Sticks. 

He tries to look tough. He has long black hair down past his collar, which 
he seldom washes. He wears tight muscle shirts and dirty jeans, ripped at the 
knees. He sneers a lot, and his dark eyes always seem to be laughing at you. 

He calls Mark and me “the city kids”. He always says it with a sneer. And 
he’s always playing stupid jokes on us. I think he’s kind of jealous of Mark and 
me. I don’t think it’s been easy for Sticks to grow up on the farm, living in the 
little guest house with his dad. 

I mean, Stanley is more like a kid than a father. 

“I saw you back there,” Mark told Sticks. 

“Well, thanks for warning me!” I snapped at Mark. I turned back angrily to 
Sticks. “I see you haven’t changed at all.” 



“Great to see you, too, Jodie,” he replied sarcastically. “The city kids are 
back for another month with the hicks!” 

“Sticks—what’s your problem?” I shot back. 

“Be nice,” Stanley muttered. “The corn has ears, you know.” 

We all stared at Stanley. Had he just made a joke? It was hard to tell with 

him. 

Stanley’s face remained serious. His big eyes stared out at me through the 
shade of his cap. “The corn has ears,” he repeated. “There are spirits in the 
field.” 

Sticks shook his head unhappily. “Dad, you spend too much time with that 
superstition book,” he muttered. 

“The book is all true,” Stanley replied. “It’s all true.” 

Sticks kicked at the dirt. He raised his eyes to me. His expression seemed 
very sad. “Things are different here,” he murmured. 

“Huh?” I didn’t understand. “What do you mean?” 

Sticks turned to his father. Stanley was staring back at him, his eyes 
narrowed. 

Sticks shrugged and didn’t reply. He grabbed Mark’s arm and squeezed it. 
“You’re as flabby as ever,” he told Mark. “Want to throw a football around this 
afternoon?” 

“It’s kind of hot,” Mark replied. He wiped the sweat off his forehead with 
the back of his hand. 

Sticks sneered at him. “Still a wimp, huh?” 

“No way!” Mark protested. “I just said it was hot, that’s all.” 

“Hey—you’ve got something on your back,” Sticks told Mark. “Turn 
around.” 

Mark obediently turned around. 

Sticks quickly bent down, picked up the wormy corncob, and stuffed it 
down the back of Mark’s T-shirt. 

I had to laugh as I watched my brother run screaming all the way back to 
the farmhouse. 

Dinner was quiet. Grandma Miriam’s fried chicken was as tasty as ever. And she 
was right about the corn. It was very sweet. Mark and I each ate two ears, 
dripping with butter. 

I enjoyed the dinner. But it upset me that both of my grandparents seemed 



so changed. Grandpa Kurt used to talk nonstop. He always had dozens of funny 
stories about the farmers in the area. And he always had new jokes to tell. 

Tonight he barely said a word. 

Grandma Miriam kept urging Mark and me to eat more. And she kept 
asking us how we liked everything. But she, too, seemed quieter. 

They both seemed tense. Uncomfortable. 

They both kept glancing down the table at Stanley, who was eating with 
both hands, butter dripping down his chin. 

Sticks sat glumly across from his father. He seemed even more unfriendly 
than usual. 

Stanley was the only cheerful person at the table. He chewed his chicken 
enthusiastically and asked for a third helping of mashed potatoes. 

“Is everything okay, Stanley?” Grandma Miriam kept asking, biting her 
bottom lip. “Everything okay?” 

Stanley burped and smiled. “Not bad,” was his reply. 

Why do things seem so different? I wondered. Is it just because Grandma 
and Grandpa are getting old? 

After dinner, we sat around the big, comfortable living room. Grandpa Kurt 
rocked gently back and forth in the antique wooden rocking chair by the 
fireplace. 

It was too hot to build a fire. But as he rocked, he stared into the dark 
fireplace, a thoughtful expression on his white-stubbled face. 

Grandma Miriam sat in her favorite chair, a big, green overstuffed armchair 
across from Grandpa Kurt. She had an unopened gardening magazine in her lap. 

Sticks, who had barely said two words the whole evening, disappeared. 
Stanley leaned against the wall, poking his teeth with a toothpick. 

Mark sank down into the long, green couch. I sat down at the other end of it 
and stared across the room. 

“Yuck. That stuffed bear still gives me the creeps!” I exclaimed. 

At the far end of the room, an enormous stuffed brown bear—about eight 
feet tall—stood straight up on its hind legs. Grandpa Kurt had shot it many years 
ago on a hunting trip. The bear’s huge paws were extended, as if ready to 
pounce. 

“That was a killer bear,” Grandpa Kurt remembered, rocking slowly, his 
eyes on the angry-looking beast. “He mauled two hunters before I shot him. I 
saved their lives.” 



I shuddered and turned away from the bear. I really hated it. I don’t know 
why Grandma Miriam let Grandpa Kurt keep it in the living room! 

“How about a scary story?” I asked Grandpa Kurt. 

He stared back at me, his blue eyes suddenly lifeless and dull. 

“Yeah. We’ve been looking forward to your stories,” Mark chimed in. “Tell 
us the one about the headless boy in the closet.” 

“No. Tell a new one,” I insisted eagerly. 

Grandpa Kurt rubbed his chin slowly. His eyes went to Stanley across the 
room. Then he cleared his throat nervously. 

“I’m kind of tired, kids,” he said softly. “Think I’ll just go to bed.” 

“But—no story?” I protested. 

He stared back at me with those dull eyes. “I don’t really know any stories,” 
he murmured. He slowly climbed to his feet and headed toward his room. 

What is going on here? I asked myself. What is wrong? 



5 


Upstairs in my bedroom later that night, I changed into a long nightshirt. The 
bedroom window was open, and a soft breeze invaded the room. 

I stared out the open window. A broad apple tree cast its shadow over the 
lawn. 

Where the grass ended, the cornfields stretched out under the glow of the 
full moon. The pale moonlight made the tall stalks shimmer like gold. The stalks 
cast long blue shadows over the field. 

Across the wide field, the scarecrows poked up stiffly like dark-uniformed 
soldiers. Their coat sleeves ruffled in the light breeze. Their pale burlap faces 
seemed to stare back at me. 

I felt a cold chill run down my back. 

So many scarecrows. At least a dozen of them, standing in straight rows. 
Like an army ready to march. 

“The scarecrow walks at midnight.” 

That’s what Stanley had said in that low, frightening tone I had never heard 
him use before. 

I glanced at the clock on the bed table. Just past ten o’clock. 

I’ll be asleep by the time they walk, I thought. 

A crazy thought. 

I sneezed. It seems I’m allergic to the farm air both day and night! 

I stared at the long shadows cast by the scarecrows. A gust of wind bent the 
stalks, making the shadows roll forward like a dark ocean wave. 

And then I saw the scarecrows start to twitch. 

“Mark!” I screamed. “Mark—come here! Hurry!” 



6 


Under the light of the full moon, I stared in horror as the dark scarecrows started 
to move. 

Their arms jerked. Their burlap heads lurched forward. 

All of them. In unison. 

All of the scarecrows were jerking, twitching, straining—as if struggling to 
pull free of their stakes. 

“Mark—hurry!” I screamed. 

I heard footsteps clomping rapidly down the hall. Mark burst breathlessly 
into my room. “Jodie—what is it?” he cried. 

I motioned frantically for him to come to the window. As he stepped beside 
me, I pointed to the cornfields. “Look—the scarecrows.” 

He gripped the windowsill and leaned out the window. 

Over his shoulder, I could see the scarecrows twitch in unison. A cold 
shudder made me wrap my arms around myself. 

“It’s the wind,” Mark said, stepping back from the window. “What’s your 
problem, Jodie? It’s just the wind blowing them around.” 

“You—you’re wrong, Mark,” I stammered, still hugging myself. “Look 
again.” 

He rolled his eyes and sighed. But he turned back and leaned out the 
window. He gazed out at the field for a long time. 

“Don’t you see?” I demanded shrilly. “They’re all moving together. Their 
arms, their heads—all moving together.” 

When Mark pulled back from the window, his blue eyes were wide and 
fearful. He stared at me thoughtfully and didn’t say a word. 

Finally, he swallowed hard and his voice came out low and frightened. 
“We’ve got to tell Grandpa Kurt,” he said. 

We rushed downstairs, but our grandparents had gone to bed. The bedroom door 
was closed. It was silent on the other side. 

“Maybe we’d better wait till tomorrow morning,” I whispered as Mark and 
I tiptoed back upstairs to our rooms. “I think we’ll be safe till then.” 

We crept back to our rooms. I pushed the window shut and locked it. Out in 



the fields, the scarecrows were still twitching, still pulling at their stakes. 

With a shudder, I turned away from the window and plunged into the bed, 
pulling the old quilt up over my head. 

I slept restlessly, tossing under the heavy quilt. In the morning, I jumped 
eagerly from bed. I ran a brush through my hair and hurried down to breakfast. 

Mark was right behind me on the stairs. He was wearing the same jeans as 
yesterday and a red-and-black Nirvana T-shirt. He hadn’t bothered to brush his 
hair. It stood straight up in back. 

“Pancakes!” he managed to choke out. Mark is only good for one word at a 
time this early in the morning. 

But the word instantly cheered me up and made me forget for a moment 
about the creepy scarecrows. 

How could I have forgotten about Grandma Miriam’s amazing chocolate 
chip pancakes? 

They are so soft, they really do melt in your mouth. And the warm 
chocolate mixed with the sweet maple syrup makes the most delicious breakfast 
I’ve ever eaten. 

As we hurried across the living room toward the kitchen, I sniffed the air, 
hoping to smell that wonderful aroma of pancake batter on the stove. 

But my nose was too stuffed up to smell anything. 

Mark and I burst into the kitchen at the same time. Grandpa Kurt and 
Stanley were already at the table. A big blue pot of coffee stood steaming in 
front of them. 

Stanley sipped his coffee. Grandpa Kurt had his face buried behind the 
morning newspaper. He glanced up and smiled as Mark and I entered. 

Everyone said good morning to everyone. 

Mark and I took our places at the table. We were so eager for the famous 
pancakes, we were practically rubbing our hands together the way cartoon 
characters do. 

Imagine our shock when Grandma Miriam set down big bowls of 
cornflakes in front of us. 

I practically burst into tears. 

I glanced across the table at Mark. He was staring back at me, his face 
revealing his surprise—and disappointment. “Cornflakes?” he asked in a high- 
pitched voice. 

Grandma Miriam had gone back to the sink. I turned to her. “Grandma 



Miriam—no pancakes?” I asked meekly. 

I saw her glance at Stanley. “I’ve stopped making them, Jodie,” she replied, 
her eyes still on Stanley. “Pancakes are too fattening.” 

“Nothing like a good bowl of cornflakes in the morning,” Stanley said with 
a big smile. He reached for the cornflakes box in the center of the table and filled 
his bowl up with a second helping. 

Grandpa Kurt grunted behind his newspaper. 

“Go ahead—eat them before they get soggy,” Grandma Miriam urged from 
the sink. 

Mark and I just stared at each other. Last summer, Grandma Miriam had 
made us a big stack of chocolate chip pancakes almost every morning! 

What is going on here? I wondered once again. 

I suddenly remembered Sticks out in the cornfields the day before, 
whispering to me, “Things are different here.” 

They sure were different. And not for the better, I decided. 

My stomach grumbled. I picked up the spoon and started to eat my 
cornflakes. I saw Mark glumly spooning his. And then I suddenly remembered 
the twitching scarecrows. 

“Grandpa Kurt—” I started. “Last night, Mark and I—we were looking out 
at the cornfields and we saw the scarecrows. They were moving. We—” 

I heard Grandma Miriam utter a low gasp from behind me. 

Grandpa Kurt lowered his newspaper. He narrowed his eyes at me, but 
didn’t say a word. 

“The scarecrows were moving!” Mark chimed in. 

Stanley chuckled. “It was the wind,” he said, his eyes on Grandpa Kurt. “It 
had to be the wind blowing them around.” 

Grandpa Kurt glared at Stanley. “You sure?” he demanded. 

“Yeah. It was the wind,” Stanley replied tensely. 

“But they were trying to get off their poles!” I cried. “We saw them!” 

Grandpa Kurt stared hard at Stanley. 

Stanley’s ears turned bright red. He lowered his eyes. “It was a breezy 
night,” he said. “They move in the wind.” 

“It’s going to be a sunny day,” Grandma Miriam said brightly from the sink. 

“But the scarecrows—” Mark insisted. 

“Yep. Looks like a real pretty day,” Grandpa Kurt mumbled, ignoring Mark. 

He doesn’t want to talk about the scarecrows, I realized. 



Is it because he doesn’t believe us? 

Grandpa Kurt turned to Stanley. “After you take the cows to pasture, maybe 
you and Jodie and Mark can do some fishing at the creek.” 

“Maybe,” Stanley replied, studying the cornflakes box. “Maybe we could 
just do that.” 

“Sounds like fun,” Mark said. Mark likes fishing. It’s one of his favorite 
sports because you don’t have to move too much. 

There’s a really pretty creek behind the cow pasture at the far end of 
Grandpa Kurt’s property. It’s very woodsy back there, and the narrow creek 
trickles softly beneath the old shade trees and is usually filled with fish. 

Finishing my cereal, I turned to Grandma Miriam at the sink. “And what 
are you doing today?” I asked her. “Maybe you and I could spend some time 
together and—” 

I stopped as she turned toward me and her hand came into view. 

“Ohhhh.” I let out a frightened moan when I saw her hand. It—it was made 
of straw! 



7 


“Jodie—what’s the matter?” Grandma Miriam asked. 

I started to point to her hand. 

Then it came into sharp focus, and I saw that her hand wasn’t straw—she 
was holding a broom. 

She had gripped it by the handle and was pulling lint off the ends of the 
straw. 

“Nothing’s wrong,” I told her, feeling like a total jerk. I rubbed my eyes. 
“I’ve got to take my allergy medicine,” I told her. “My eyes are so watery. I keep 
seeing things!” 

I was seeing scarecrows everywhere I looked! 

I scolded myself for acting so crazy. 

Stop thinking about scarecrows, I told myself. Stanley was right. The 
scarecrows had moved in the wind last night. 

It was just the wind.

Stanley took us fishing later that morning. As we started off for the creek, he 
seemed in a really cheerful mood. 

He smiled as he swung the big picnic basket Grandma Miriam had packed 
for our lunch. “She put in all my favorites,” Stanley said happily. 

He patted the basket with childish satisfaction. 

He had three bamboo fishing poles tucked under his left arm. He carried the 
big straw basket in his right hand. He refused to let Mark and me carry anything. 

The warm air smelled sweet. The sun beamed down in a cloudless, blue 
sky. Blades of recently cut grass stuck to my white sneakers as we headed across 
the back yard. 

The medicine had helped. My eyes were much better. 

Stanley turned just past the barn and began walking quickly along its back 
wall. His expression turned solemn. He appeared to be concentrating hard on 
something. 

“Hey—where are we going?” I called, hurrying to keep up with him. 



He didn’t seem to hear me. Taking long strides, swinging the straw picnic 
basket as he walked, he headed back in the direction we started from. 

“Hey—wait up!” Mark called breathlessly. My brother hates to hurry when 
he can take his time. 

“Stanley—wait!” I cried, tugging his shirtsleeve. “We’re going around in 
circles!” 

He nodded, his expression serious under the black baseball cap. “We have 
to circle the barn three times,” he said in a low voice. 

“Huh? Why?” I demanded. 

We started our second turn around the barn. 

“It will bring us good luck with our fishing,” Stanley replied. Then he 
added, “It’s in the book. Everything is in the book.” 

I opened my mouth to tell him this was really silly. But I decided not to. He 
seemed so serious about that superstition book of his. I didn’t want to spoil it for 
him. 

Besides, Mark and I could use the exercise. 

A short while later, we finished circling and started walking along the dirt 
path that led past the cornfields to the creek. Stanley’s smile returned 
immediately. 

He really believes the superstitions in the book, I realized. 

I wondered if Sticks believed them, too. 

“Where’s Sticks?” I asked, kicking a big clump of dirt across the path. 

“Doing chores,” Stanley replied. “Sticks is a good worker. A real good 
worker. But he’ll be along soon, I bet. Sticks never likes to miss out on a fishing 
trip.” 

The sun began to feel really strong on my face and on my shoulders. I 
wondered if I should run back and get some sunblock. 

The dark-suited scarecrows appeared to stare at me as we walked past the 
tall rows of cornstalks. I could swear their pale, painted faces turned to follow 
me as I went by. 

And did one of them lift its arm to wave a straw hand at me? 

I scolded myself for such stupid thoughts, and turned my eyes away. 

Stop thinking about scarecrows, Jodie! I told myself. 

Forget your bad dream. Forget about the dumb scarecrows. 

It’s a beautiful day, and you have nothing to worry about. Try to relax and 
have a good time. 



The path led into tall pine woods behind the cornfields. It got shady and 
much cooler as soon as we stepped into the woods. 

“Can’t we take a taxi the rest of the way?” Mark whined. A typical Mark 
joke. He really would take a taxi if there was one! 

Stanley shook his head. “City kids,” he muttered, grinning. 

The path ended, and we continued through the trees. It smelled so piney and 
fresh in the woods. I saw a tiny, brown-and-white chipmunk dart into a hollow 
log. 

In the near distance I could hear the musical trickle of the creek. 

Suddenly, Stanley stopped. He bent and picked up a pinecone. 

The three fishing poles fell to the ground. He didn’t seem to notice. He held 
the pinecone close to his face, studying it. 

“A pinecone on the shady side means a long winter,” he said, turning the 
dry cone in his hand. 

Mark and I bent to pick up the poles. “Is that what the book says?” Mark 
asked. 

Stanley nodded. He set the pinecone down carefully where he found it. 

“The cone is still sticky. That’s a good sign,” he said seriously. 

Mark let out a giggle. I knew he was trying not to laugh at Stanley. But the 
giggle escaped somehow. 

Stanley’s big brown eyes filled with hurt. “It’s all true, Mark,” he said 
quietly. “It’s all true.” 

“I—I’d like to read that book,” Mark said, glancing at me. 

“It’s a very hard book,” Stanley replied. “I have trouble with some of the 
words.” 

“I can hear the creek,” I broke in, changing the subject. “Let’s go. I want to 
catch some fish before lunchtime.” 

The clear water felt cold against my legs. The smooth rocks of the creek bed 
were slippery under my bare feet. 

All three of us had waded into the shallow creek. Mark had wanted to be 
down on the grassy shore to fish. But I convinced him it was much more fun— 
and much easier to catch something—if you stand in the water. 

“Yeah, I’ll catch something,” he grumbled as he rolled up the cuffs of his 
jeans. “I’ll catch pneumonia!” 

Stanley let out a loud laugh. It sounded like, “Har! Har! Har!” 



He set the big picnic basket down carefully on the dry grass. Then he rolled 
up the legs of his denim overalls. Carrying a pole high in one hand, he stepped 
into the water. 

“Ooooh! It’s cold!” he cried, waving his arms above his head, nearly losing 
his balance on the slippery rocks. 

“Stanley—didn’t you forget something?” I called to him. 

He turned, confused. His big ears became bright red. “What did I forget, 
Jodie?” 

I pointed to his fishing pole. “How about some bait?” I called. 

He glanced at the empty hook on the end of his line. Then he made his way 
back to shore to get a worm to bait his hook. 

A few minutes later, all three of us were in the water. Mark complained at 
first about how cold it was and about how the rocks on the bottom hurt his 
delicate little feet. 

But after a while, he got into it, too. 

The creek at this point was only about two feet deep. The water was very 
clear and trickled rapidly, making little swirls and dips over the rocky bottom. 

I lowered my line into the water and watched the red plastic float bob on 
the surface. If it started to sink, I’d know I had a bite. 

The sun felt warm on my face. The cool water flowed past pleasantly. 

I wish it were deep enough to swim here, I thought. 

“Hey—I’ve got something!” Mark cried excitedly. 

Stanley and I turned and watched him tug up his line. 

Mark pulled with all his might. “It—it’s a big one, I think,” he said. 

Finally, he gave one last really hard tug—and pulled up a thick clump of 
green weeds. 

“Good one, Mark,” I said, rolling my eyes. “It’s a big one, all right.” 

“You’re a big one,” Mark shot back. “Abig jerk.” 

“Don’t be such a baby,” I muttered. 

I brushed away a buzzing horsefly and tried to concentrate on my line. But 
my mind started to wander. It always does when I’m fishing. 

I found myself thinking about the tall scarecrows in the field. They stood so 
darkly, so menacingly, so alert. Their painted faces all had the same hard stare. 

I was still picturing them when I felt the hand slip around my ankle. 

The straw scarecrow hand. 

It reached up from the water, circled my ankle, and started to tighten its 



cold, wet grip around my leg. 



8 


I screamed and tried to kick the hand away. 

But my feet slipped on the smooth rocks. My hands shot up as I toppled 
backwards. 

“Ohh!” I cried out again as I hit the water. 

The scarecrow hung on. 

On my back, the water rushing over me, I kicked and thrashed my arms. 

And then I saw it. The clump of green weeds that had wrapped itself around 
my ankle. 

“Oh, no,” I moaned out loud. 

No scarecrow. Only weeds. 

I lowered my foot to the water. I didn’t move. I just lay there on my back, 
waiting for my heart to stop pounding, feeling once again like a total jerk. 

I glanced up at Mark and Stanley. They were staring down at me, too 
startled to laugh. 

“Don’t say a word,” I warned them, struggling to my feet. “I’m warning 
you—don’t say a word.” 

Mark snickered, but he obediently didn’t say anything. 

“I didn’t bring a towel,” Stanley said with concern. “I’m sorry, Jodie, I 
didn’t know you wanted to swim.” 

That made Mark burst out in loud guffaws. 

I shot Mark a warning stare. My T-shirt and shorts were soaked. I started to 
shore, carrying the pole awkwardly in front of me. 

“I don’t need a towel,” I told Stanley. “It feels good. Very refreshing.” 

“You scared away all the fish, Jodie,” Mark complained. 

“No. You scared them away. They saw your face!” I replied. I knew I was 
acting like a baby now. But I didn’t care. I was cold and wet and angry. 

I stomped onto the shore, shaking water from my hair. 

“I think they’re biting better down here,” I heard Stanley call to Mark. I 
turned to see him disappear around a curve of the creek. 

Stepping carefully over the rocks, Mark followed after him. They were both 
hidden from view behind the thick trees. 



I squeezed my hair, trying to get the creek water out. Finally, I gave up and 
tossed my hair behind my shoulder. 

I was debating what to do next when I heard a crackling sound in the 
woods. 

A footstep? 

I turned and stared into the trees. I didn’t see anyone. 

A chipmunk scurried away over the blanket of dead, brown leaves. Had 
someone—or something —frightened the chipmunk? 

I listened hard. Another crackling footstep. Rustling sounds. 

“Who—who’s there?” I called. 

The low bushes rustled in reply. 

“Sticks—is that you? Sticks?” My voice trembled. 

No reply. 

It has to be Sticks, I told myself. This is Grandpa Kurt’s property. No one 
else would be back here. 

“Sticks—stop trying to scare me!” I shouted angrily. 

No reply. 

Another footstep. The crack of a twig. 

More rustling sounds. Closer now. 

“Sticks—I know it’s you!” I called uncertainly. “I’m really tired of your 
dumb tricks. Sticks?” 

My eyes stared straight ahead into the trees. 

I listened. Silence now. 

Heavy silence. 

And then I raised my hand to my mouth as I saw the dark figure poke out 
from the shade of two tall pines. 

“Sticks—?” 

I squinted into the deep blue shadows. 

I saw the bulging, dark coat. The faded burlap head. The dark fedora hat 
tilted over the black, painted eyes. 

I saw the straw poking out under the jacket. The straw sticking out from the 
long jacket sleeves. 

A scarecrow. 

A scarecrow that had followed us? Followed us to the creek? 

Squinting hard into the shadows, staring at its evil, frozen grin, I opened my 
mouth to scream—but no sound came out. 



9 


And then a hand grabbed my shoulder. 

“Ohh!” I let out a cry and spun around. 

Stanley stared at me with concern. He and Mark had come up behind me. 

“Jodie, what’s the matter?” Stanley asked. “Mark and I—we thought we 
heard you calling.” 

“What’s up?” Mark asked casually. The line on his fishing pole had become 
tangled, and he was working to untangle it. “Did you see a squirrel or 
something?” 

“No—I—I—” My heart was pounding so hard, I could barely speak. 

“Cool your jets, Jodie,” Mark said, imitating me. 

“I saw a scarecrow!” I finally managed to scream. 

Stanley’s mouth dropped open. 

Mark narrowed his eyes suspiciously at me. “A scarecrow? Here in the 
woods?” 

“It—it was walking,” I stammered. “I heard it. I heard it walking.” 

A choking sound escaped Stanley’s open mouth. 

Mark continued to stare at me, his features tight with fear. 

“It’s over there!” I cried. “Right there! Look!” 

I pointed. 

But it was gone. 



10 


Stanley stared hard at me, his big brown eyes filled with confusion. 

“I saw it,” I insisted. “Between those two trees.” I pointed again. 

“You did? A scarecrow? Really?” Stanley asked. I could see he was really 
starting to get scared. 

“Well... maybe it was just the shadows,” I said. I didn’t want to frighten 
Stanley. 

I shivered. “I’m soaked. I’ve got to get back in the sunlight,” I told them. 

“But did you see it?” Stanley asked, his big eyes locked on mine. “Did you 
see a scarecrow here, Jodie?” 

“I—I don’t think so, Stanley,” I replied, trying to calm him down. “I’m 
sorry.” 

“This is very bad,” he murmured, talking to himself. “This is very bad. I 
have to read the book. This is very bad.” Then, muttering to himself, he turned 
and ran. 

“Stanley—stop!” I called. “Stanley—come back! Don’t leave us down 
here!” 

But he was gone. Vanished into the woods. 

“I’m going after him,” I told Mark. “And then I’m going to tell Grandpa 
Kurt about this. Can you carry back the fishing poles by yourself?” 

“Do I have to?” Mark whined. My brother is so lazy! 

I told him he had to. Then I went running along the path through the woods 
toward the farmhouse. 

My heart pounded as I reached the cornfields. The dark-coated scarecrows 
appeared to stare at me. As my sneakers thudded on the narrow dirt path, I 
imagined the straw arms reaching for me, reaching to grab me and pull me into 
the corn. 

But the scarecrows kept their silent, still watch over the cornstalks. They 
didn’t move or twitch as I hurtled past. 

Up ahead I saw Stanley running to his little house. I cupped my hands over 
my mouth and called to him, but he disappeared inside. 

I decided to find Grandpa Kurt and tell him about the scarecrow I saw 
moving through the woods. 



The barn door was open, and I thought I saw someone moving around 
inside. “Grandpa Kurt?” I called breathlessly. “Are you in there?” 

My wet hair bounced on my shoulders as I ran into the barn. I stood in the 
rectangle of light that stretched from the doorway and stared into the darkness. 
“Grandpa Kurt?” I called, struggling to catch my breath. 

My eyes slowly adjusted to the dim light. I stepped deeper into the barn. 
“Grandpa Kurt? Are you here?” 

Hearing a soft scraping sound against the far wall, I made my way toward 
it. “Grandpa Kurt—can I talk to you? I really need to talk to you!” My voice 
sounded tiny and frightened in the big, dark barn. My sneakers scraped over the 
dry straw floor as I walked toward the back. 

I spun around as I heard a rumbling sound. 

The light grew dimmer. 

“Hey—” I shouted. Too late. 

The barn door was sliding shut. 

“Hey! Who’s there?” I cried out in stunned anger. “Hey—stop!” 

I slipped over the straw as I started to lurch toward the sliding door. I fell 
down hard, but quickly scrambled to my feet. 

I darted toward the door. But I wasn’t fast enough. 

As the heavy door rumbled shut, the rectangle of light grew narrower, 
narrower. 

The door slammed with a deafening bang. 

The darkness slid around me, circled me, covered me. 

“Hey—let me out!” I screamed. “Let me out of here!” 

My scream ended in a choked sob. My breath escaped in noisy gasps. 

I pounded on the wooden barn door with both fists. Then I frantically swept 
my hands over the door, searching blindly for a latch, for something to pull— 
some way to open the door. 

When I couldn’t find anything, I pounded on the door until my fists hurt. 

Then I stopped and took a step back. 

Calm down, Jodie, I told myself. Calm down. You’ll get out of the barn. 
You’ll find a way out. It’s not like you’re trapped in here forever. 

I tried to force away my panic. I held my breath, waiting for my heart to 
stop racing. Then I let my breath out slowly. Slooooowly. 

I was just starting to feel a little better when I heard the scraping sound. 

A dry scraping. The sound of a shoe crunching over straw. 



“Oh.” I let out a sharp cry, then raised both hands to my face and listened. 
Scrape. Scrape. Scrape. 

The sound of footsteps. Slow, steady footsteps, so light on the barn floor. 
Footsteps coming toward me in the darkness. 



11 


“Who—who’s there?” I choked out, my voice a hushed whisper. 

No reply. 

Scrape. Scrape. Scrape. 

The soft, scratchy footsteps came closer. 

“Who is it?” I cried shrilly. 

No reply. 

I stared into the darkness. I couldn’t see a thing. 

Scrape. Scrape. 

Whoever—or whatever—was moving steadily toward me. 

I took a step back. Then another. 

I tried to cry out, but my throat was choked with fear. 

I let out a terrified gasp as I backed into something. In my panic, it took me 
a few seconds to realize that it was only a wooden ladder. The ladder that led up 
to the hayloft. 

The footsteps crunched closer. Closer. 

“Please—” I uttered in a tiny, choked voice. “Please—don’t—” 

Closer. Closer. Scraping toward me through the heavy darkness. 

I gripped the sides of the ladder. “Please—leave me alone!” 

Before I realized what I was doing, I was pulling myself up the ladder. My 
arms trembled, and my legs felt as if they each weighed a thousand pounds. 

But I scrambled rung by rung toward the hayloft, away from the 
frightening, scraping footsteps down below. 

When I reached the top, I lay flat on the hayloft floor. I struggled to listen, 
to hear the footsteps over the loud pounding of my heart. 

Was I being followed? Was the thing chasing me up the ladder? 

I held my breath. I listened. 

Scrabbling sounds. Scraping footsteps. 

“Go away!” I screamed frantically. “Whoever you are—go away!” 

But the sounds continued, dry and scratchy. Like straw brushing against 
straw. 

Scrambling to my knees, I turned to the small, square hayloft window. 



Sunlight filtered in through the window. The light made the hay strewn over the 
floor gleam like slender strands of gold. 

My heart still pounding, I crawled to the window. 

Yes! The heavy rope was still tied to the side. The rope that Mark and I 
always used to swing down to the ground. 

I can get out of here! I told myself happily. 

I can grab the rope and swing out of the hayloft. I can escape! 

Eagerly, I grabbed the rope with both hands. 

Then I poked my head out the window and gazed down to the ground. 

And let out a scream of surprise and horror. 



12 


Gazing down, I saw a black hat. Beneath it, a black coat. 

A scarecrow. Perched outside the barn door. As if standing guard. 

It jerked its arms and legs at the sound of my scream. 

And as I stared in disbelief, it hurried around the side of the barn, hobbling 
on its straw legs, its arms flapping at its sides. 

I blinked several times. 

Was I seeing things? 

My hands were cold and wet. I gripped the rope more tightly. Taking a deep 
breath, I plunged out of the small square window. 

The heavy rope swung out over the front of the barn. 

Down, down. I hit the ground hard, landing on my feet. 

“Ow!” I cried out as the rope cut my hands. 

I let go and ran around to the side of the barn. 

I wanted to catch up to that scarecrow. I wanted to see if it really was a 
scarecrow, a scarecrow that could run. 

Ignoring my fear, I ran as fast as I could. 

No sign of him on this side of the barn. 

My chest began to ache. My temples throbbed. 

I turned the corner and headed around the back of the barn, searching for 
the fleeing scarecrow. 

And ran right into Sticks! 

“Hey—” We both shouted in surprise as we collided. 

I frantically untangled myself from him. Staring past him, I saw that the 
scarecrow had vanished. 

“What’s the hurry?” Sticks demanded. “You practically ran me over!” 

He was wearing faded denim jeans, slashed at both knees, and a faded 
purple muscle shirt that only showed off how skinny he was. His black hair was 
tied back in a short ponytail. 

“A—a scarecrow!” I stammered. 

And, then—that instant—I knew. 

In that instant, I solved the whole mystery of the scarecrows. 



13 


It hadn’t been a scarecrow. 

It was Sticks. 

In the woods down by the creek. And, now, outside the barn. 

Sticks. Playing another one of his mean tricks. 

And I was suddenly certain that Sticks had somehow made the scarecrows 
twitch and pull on their stakes last night. 

Sticks just loved fooling the “city kids”. Ever since Mark and I had been 
little, he’d played the scariest, meanest practical jokes on us. 

Sometimes Sticks could be a nice guy. But he had a real cruel streak. 

“I thought you were fishing,” he said casually. 

“Well, I’m not,” I snapped. “Sticks, why do you keep trying to scare us?” 

“Huh?” He pretended he didn’t know what I was talking about. 

“Sticks, give me a break,” I muttered. “I know you were the scarecrow just 
now. I’m not stupid!” 

“Scarecrow? What scarecrow?” he asked, giving me a wide-eyed, innocent 
expression. 

“You were dressed as a scarecrow,” I accused him. “Or else you carried one 
here, and pulled it on a string or something.” 

“You’re totally crazy,” Sticks replied angrily. “Have you been out in the sun 
too long or something?” 

“Sticks—give up,” I said. “Why are you doing this? Why do you keep 
trying to scare Mark and me? You scared your Dad, too.” 

“Jodie, you’re nuts!” he exclaimed. “I really don’t have time to be dressing 
up in costumes just to amuse you and your brother.” 

“Sticks—you’re not fooling me,” I insisted. “You—” 

I stopped short when I saw Sticks’ expression change. “Dad!” he cried, 
suddenly frightened. “Dad! You say he was scared?” 

I nodded. 

“I’ve got to find him!” Sticks exclaimed frantically, “He—he could do 
something terrible !” 

“Sticks, your joke has gone far enough!” I cried. “Just stop it!” 



But he was already running toward the front of the barn, calling for his 
father, his voice shrill and frantic. 

Sticks didn’t find his dad until dinnertime. That’s the next time I saw him, too— 
just before dinner. He was carrying his big superstition book, holding it tightly 
under his arm. 

“Jodie,” he whispered, motioning for me to come close. His face was red. 
His dark eyes revealed his excitement. 

“Hi, Stanley,” I whispered back uncertainly. 

“Don’t tell Grandpa Kurt about the scarecrow,” Stanley whispered. 

“Huh?” Stanley’s request caught me off guard. 

“Don’t tell your grandpa,” Stanley repeated. “It will only upset him. We 
don’t want to frighten him, do we?” 

“But, Stanley—” I started to protest. 

Stanley raised a finger to his lips. “Don’t tell, Jodie. Your grandpa doesn’t 
like to be upset. I’ll take care of the scarecrow. I have the book.” He tapped the 
big book with his finger. 

I started to tell Stanley that the scarecrow was only Sticks, playing a mean 
joke. But Grandma Miriam called us to the table before I could get the words 
out. 

Stanley carried his superstition book to the table. Every few bites, he would 
pick up the big, black book and read a few paragraphs. 

He moved his lips as he read. But I was sitting down at the other end of the 
table and couldn’t make out any of the words. 

Sticks kept his eyes down on his plate and hardly said a word. I think he 
was really embarrassed that his father was reading the superstition book at the 
dinner table. 

But Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam didn’t act the least bit surprised. 
They talked cheerfully to Mark and me and kept passing us more food—as if 
they didn’t even notice Stanley’s behavior. 

I really wanted to tell Grandpa Kurt about how Sticks was trying to scare 
Mark and me. But I decided to listen to Stanley and not upset my grandfather. 

Besides, I could deal with Sticks if I had to. He thought he was so tough. 
But I wasn’t the least bit afraid of him. 

Stanley was still reading, jabbering away as he read, as Grandma Miriam 
cleared the dinner dishes. Mark and I helped. Then we took our seats as 



Grandma Miriam carried a big cherry pie to the table. 

“Weird,” Mark whispered to me, staring at the pie. 

He was right. “Doesn’t Grandpa Kurt like apple pie?” I blurted out. 

Grandma Miriam gave me a tense smile. “Too early in the year for apples,” 
she murmured. 

“But isn’t Grandpa Kurt allergic to cherries?” Mark asked. 

Grandma Miriam started cutting the pie with a silver pie cutter. “Everyone 
loves cherry pie,” she replied, concentrating on her work. Then she raised her 
eyes to Stanley. “Isn’t that right, Stanley?” 

Stanley grinned over his book. “It’s my favorite,” he said. “Grandma 
Miriam always serves my favorite.” 

After dinner, Grandpa Kurt once again refused to tell Mark and me a scary story. 

We were sitting around the fireplace, staring at the crackling yellow flames. 
Even though it had been so hot, the air had grown cool this evening, cool enough 
to build a nice, toasty fire. 

Grandpa Kurt was in his rocking chair at the side of the hearth. The old 
wooden chair creaked as he rocked slowly back and forth. 

He had always loved to gaze at the fire and tell us one of his frightening 
stories. You could see the leaping flames reflected in his blue eyes. And his 
voice would go lower and lower as the story got scarier. 

But tonight he shrugged when I asked him for a story. He stared dully at the 
huge stuffed bear on its pedestal against the wall. Then he glanced across the 
room at Stanley. 

“Wish I knew some good stories,” Grandpa Kurt replied with a sigh. “But 
I’ve clean run out.” 

A short while later, Mark and I trudged upstairs to our bedrooms. “What is 
his problem?” Mark whispered as we climbed. 

I shook my head. “Beats me.” 

“He seems so... different,” Mark said. 

“Everyone here does,” I agreed. “Except for Sticks. He’s still trying to scare 
us city kids.” 

“Let’s just ignore him,” Mark suggested. “Let’s just pretend we don’t see 
him running around in his stupid scarecrow costume.” 

I agreed. Then I said good-night and headed into my room. 

Ignore the scarecrows, I thought as I arranged the blankets on the bed. 



Just ignore them. 

I’m not going to think about scarecrows again, I told myself. 

Sticks can go jump in the creek. 

Climbing into bed, I pulled the quilt up to my chin. I lay on my back, 
staring up at the cracks in the ceiling, trying to figure out what kind of picture 
they formed. There were three jagged cracks. I decided they looked like bolts of 
lightning. 

If I squinted, I could make them look like an old man with a beard. 

I yawned. I felt really sleepy, but I couldn’t get to sleep. 

It was only my second night here at the farm. It always takes me awhile to 
adjust to being in a new place and sleeping in a different bed. 

I closed my eyes. Through the open window, I could hear the soft mooing 
of cows from the barn. 

And I could hear the whisper of the wind as it brushed through the tall 
cornstalks. 

My nose was totally stuffed up. Bet I snore tonight, I thought. 

That is, if I ever get to sleep! 

I tried counting sheep. It didn’t seem to be working, so I tried counting 
cows. Big, bulky, bouncing, sloooooow-moooooving cows. 

I counted to a hundred twelve before I decided that wasn’t working, either. 

I turned onto my side. Then, after a few minutes, I tried my other side. 

I found myself thinking about my best friend, Shawna. I wondered if 
Shawna was having a good time at camp. 

I thought about some of my other friends. Most of them were just hanging 
around this summer, not doing much of anything. 

When I glanced at the clock, I was surprised to see it was nearly twelve. 
I’ve got to get to sleep, I told myself. I’ll be wrecked tomorrow if I don’t get 
some sleep. 

I settled onto my back, pulling the soft quilt up to my chin again. I closed 
my eyes and tried to picture nothing. Just empty, black space. Endless, empty 
space. 

The next thing I knew, I was hearing scratching sounds. 

I ignored them at first. I thought the curtains were flapping against the open 
window. 

Got to get to sleep, I urged myself. Got to get to sleep. 

The scratching grew louder. Closer. 



I heard a scraping sound. 

From outside the window? 

I opened my eyes. Shadows danced on the ceiling. I realized I was holding 
my breath. 

Listening hard. 

Another scrape. More scratching. Dry scratching. 

I heard a low groan. 

“Huh?” A startled gasp escaped my lips. 

I pulled myself up against the headboard. I tugged the quilt up to my chin, 
gripping it tightly with both hands. 

I heard more dry scraping. Like sandpaper, I thought. 

Suddenly the room grew darker. 

I saw something pull itself up to the window. A dark figure. Blocking the 
moonlight. 

“Who—who’s there?” I tried to call. But my voice came out a choked 
whisper. 

I could see a shadowy head, black against the purple sky. 

It rose up in the window. Dark shoulders. Followed by a darker chest. Black 
against black. 

A silent shadow, slipping into my room. 

“H-help! ” Another stammered whisper. 

My heart had stopped beating. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t breathe. 

It slid over the windowsill. Brushed away the curtains as it lowered itself 
into my room. 

Its feet scraped over the bare floorboards. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

It moved slowly, steadily toward my bed. 

I struggled to get up. 

Too late. 

My feet tangled in the quilt. 

I fell to the floor, landing hard on my elbows. 

I raised my eyes to see it move closer. 

I opened my mouth to scream as it emerged from the shadows. 

And then I recognized him. Recognized his face. 

“Grandpa Kurt!” I cried. “Grandpa Kurt—what are you doing here? Why 



did you climb in the window?” 

He didn’t reply. His cold blue eyes glared down at me. His whole face 
twisted into an ugly frown. 

And then he raised both arms above me. 

And I saw that he had no hands. 

Clumps of straw poked out from his jacket sleeves. 

Only straw. 

“Grandpa—no!!” I shrieked. 



14 


“Grandpa— please — no!” I shrieked as he lowered his straw arms toward me. 

He bared his teeth like an angry dog and let out a sharp, frightening growl. 
The straw hands reached down for me. 

Grandpa Kurt’s face was the same. The face I had always known. Except 
that his eyes were so cold, so cold and dead. 

The straw hands brushed over my face as I climbed to my feet. I took a step 
back, raising my hands like a shield. 

“Grandpa—what’s wrong? What’s happening?” I whispered. 

My temples were pounding. My entire body shook. 

His cold eyes narrowed in fury as he reached for me again. 

“Noooo!” I let out a long wail of terror. Then I turned and stumbled to the 

door. 

His feet scraped over the bare floor as he lurched toward me. Glancing 
down, I saw the straw poking out from the cuffs of his pants. 

His feet—they were straw, too. 

“Grandpa Kurt! Grandpa Kurt! What is happening ?” Was that really my 
voice, so shrill and frightened? 

He swung an arm. The straw scratched my back as it swept over me. 

I grabbed for the doorknob. Twisted it. Pulled open the door. 

And cried out again as I collided with Grandma Miriam. 

“Oh, help! Please help! Grandma Miriam—he’s chasing me!” I cried. 

Her expression didn’t change. She stared back at me. 

In the dim light of the hallway, her face came into focus. 

And I saw that her glasses were painted on. 

And her eyes. And mouth. And big round nose. 

Her entire face was painted on. 

“You’re not real!” I cried. 

And then darkness swept over me as Grandpa Kurt’s straw hands wrapped 
around my face. 



15 


I woke up coughing and choking. 

Surrounded by darkness. Heavy darkness. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that I’d been sleeping with the pillow 
over my face. 

Tossing it to the foot of the bed, I pulled myself up, breathing hard. My face 
was hot. My nightshirt stuck wetly to my back. 

I glanced at the window, suddenly afraid that I’d see a dark figure climbing 
in. 

The curtains fluttered gently. The early morning sky was still gray. I heard 
the shrill cry of a rooster. 

A dream. It had all been a frightening nightmare. 

Taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly, I lowered my feet to the floor. 

I stared at the gray morning light through the window. Just a dream, I 
assured myself. Calm down, Jodie. It was just a dream. 

I could hear someone moving around downstairs. Staggering over to the 
dresser, I pulled out some fresh clothes—a pair of faded denim cutoffs, a 
sleeveless blue T-shirt. 

My eyes were watery. Everything was a blur. My allergies were really bad 
this morning. 

Rubbing my eyes, I made my way to the window and peered out. A red ball 
of a sun was just peeking over the broad apple tree. A heavy morning dew made 
the grass of the back yard sparkle like emeralds. 

The sea of cornstalks rose darkly behind the grass. The scarecrows stood 
stiffly over them, arms outstretched as if welcoming the morning. 

The rooster crowed again. 

What a stupid nightmare, I thought. I shook myself as if trying to shake it 
from my memory. Then I ran a brush through my hair and hurried down to 
breakfast. 

Mark was just entering the kitchen as I came in. We found Grandma 
Miriam by herself at the table. A mug of tea steamed in front of her as she gazed 
out the window at the morning sunlight. 

She turned and smiled at us as we entered. “Good morning. Sleep well?” 



I was tempted to tell her about my scary nightmare. But, instead, I asked, 
“Where’s Grandpa Kurt?” I stared at his empty chair. The newspaper lay 
unopened on the table. 

“They all went off early,” Grandma Miriam replied. 

She stood up, walked to the cabinets, and brought a big box of cornflakes to 
the table. She motioned for us to take our places. “Pretty day,” she said 
cheerfully. 

“No pancakes?” Mark blurted out. 

Grandma Miriam stopped halfway across the room. “I’ve completely 
forgotten how to make them,” she said without turning around. 

She set two bowls down and made her way to the refrigerator to get the 
milk. “You kids want orange juice this morning? It’s fresh squeezed.” 

Grandma Miriam set the milk carton down beside my bowl. She smiled at 
me. Her eyes remained dull behind her square-rimmed glasses. “I hope you two 
are enjoying your visit,” she said quietly. 

“We would be if it weren’t for Sticks,” I blurted out. 

Her expression turned to surprise. “Sticks?” 

“He’s trying to scare us again,” I said. 

Grandma Miriam tsk-tsked. “You know Sticks,” she replied softly. 

She pushed at her red hair with both hands. “What are you two planning for 
today?” she asked brightly. “It’s a beautiful morning to go riding. Before they 
left this morning, Grandpa Kurt had Stanley saddle up Betsy and Maggie, in case 
you wanted to ride.” 

“Sounds like fun,” I told her. “What do you say, Mark? Before it gets really 
hot out?” 

“I guess,” Mark replied. 

“You two always enjoyed riding along the creek,” Grandma Miriam said, 
putting the cornflakes box away. 

I stared across the room at her, stared at her red, curly hair, her pudgy arms, 
her flowered housedress. 

“Are you okay, Grandma Miriam?” I asked. The words just tumbled out of 
my mouth. “Is everything okay here?” 

She didn’t reply. Instead, she lowered her eyes, avoiding my gaze. “Go 
have your ride,” she said quietly. “Don’t worry about me.” 


Grandpa Kurt always called Betsy and Maggie the “old gray mares”. I guess 



because they were both old and they were both gray. And they were as grumpy 
as can be when Mark and I climbed onto their saddles and started to urge them 
from the barn. 

They were the perfect horses for us “city kids”. The only time we ever got 
to ride horses was during our summers at the farm. So we were not exactly the 
most skillful riders in the world. 

Bumping along on these two old nags was just our speed. And even as slow 
as we were moving, I dug my knees into Betsy’s sides and held onto the saddle 
horn for dear life. 

We followed the dirt path past the cornfields toward the woods. The sun 
was still climbing a hazy, yellow sky. But the air was already hot and sticky. 

Flies buzzed around me as I bounced on top of Betsy. I removed one hand 
from the saddle horn to brush a big one off Betsy’s back. 

Several scarecrows stared back at us as Mark and I rode past. Their black 
eyes glared at us from under their floppy hats. 

Mark and I didn’t say a word. We were keeping to our promise of not 
talking about scarecrows. 

I turned my eyes to the woods and tossed the reins, urging Betsy to move a 
little faster. She ignored me, of course, and kept clopping along over the path at 
her slow, steady pace. 

“I wonder if these horses can still get up to a trot,” Mark called. He was a 
few paces behind me on the narrow dirt path. 

“Let’s give it a try!” I called back, grabbing the reins tighter. 

I dug my sneaker heels into Betsy’s side. “Go, girl—go!” I cried, slapping 
her gently with the reins. 

“Whoooa!” I let out a startled cry as the old horse obediently began to trot. I 
really didn’t think she would cooperate! 

“All right! Cool!” I heard Mark shout behind me. 

Their hooves clopped loudly on the path as the two horses began to pick up 
speed. I was bouncing hard over the saddle, holding on tightly, off-balance, 
beginning to wonder if this was such a hot idea. 

I didn’t have a chance to cry out when the dark figure hurtled across the 

path. 

It all happened so fast. 

Betsy was trotting rapidly. I was bouncing on the saddle, bouncing so hard, 
my feet slipped out of the stirrups. 



The dark figure leaped out right in front of us. 

Betsy let out a shrill, startled whinny—and reared back. 

As I started to fall, I saw immediately what had jumped onto the path. 
It was a grinning scarecrow. 



16 


Betsy rose up with a high whinny. 

My hand grabbed for the reins, but they slipped from my grasp. 

The sky appeared to roll over me, then tilt away. 

I slid backwards, out of the saddle, off the horse, my feet thrashing wildly 
for the flapping stirrups. 

The sky tilted even more. 

I hit the ground hard on my back. 

I remember only the shock of stopping so abruptly, the surprise at how hard 
the ground felt, how so much pain shot through my body so quickly. 

The sky turned bright red. A glowing scarlet. Like an explosion. 

And then the scarlet faded to deep, deep, endlessly deep black. 


* * * 


I heard low moans before I opened my eyes. 

I recognized the voice. Mark’s voice. 

My eyes still shut, I opened my mouth to call to him. My lips moved, but 
no sound came out. 

“Ohhhh.” Another low groan from him, not far from me. 

“Mark—?” I managed to choke out. My back ached. My shoulders hurt. My 
head throbbed. 

Everything hurt. 

“My wrist—I think I broke it,” Mark said, his voice shrill and frightened. 
“You fell, too?” I asked. 

“Yeah. I fell, too,” he groaned. 

I opened my eyes. Finally. I opened my eyes. 

And saw the hazy sky. 

All a blur. Everything was a watery blur. 

I stared at the sky, trying to get it in focus. 

And then saw a hand in front of the sky. A hand lowering itself toward me. 
A bony hand stretching out from a heavy black coat. 



The hand of the scarecrow, I realized, staring up helplessly at it. 
The hand of the scarecrow, coming down to grab me. 



17 


The hand grabbed my shoulder. 

Too terrified to cry out, too dazed to think clearly, my eyes followed the 
dark coat sleeve—up to the shoulder—up to the face. 

A blur. All a frightening blur. 

And then the face became clear. 

“Stanley!” I cried. 

He leaned over me, his red ears glowing, his face tight with worry. He 
gently grabbed my shoulder. “Jodie—are you all right?” 

“Stanley—it’s you!” I exclaimed happily. I sat up. “I think I’m okay. I don’t 
know. Everything hurts.” 

“What a bad fall,” Stanley said softly. “I was in the field. And I saw it. I 
saw the scarecrow....” 

His voice trailed off. I followed his frightened gaze up ahead of me on the 
dirt path. 

The scarecrow lay facedown across the path. 

“I saw it jump out,” Stanley uttered with a shudder that shook his whole 
body. 

“My wrist...” Mark moaned from nearby. 

I turned as Stanley hurried over to him. Mark was sitting up in the grass at 
the side of the path, holding his wrist. “Look—it’s starting to swell up,” he 
groaned. 

“Oooh, that’s bad. That’s bad,” Stanley said, shaking his head. 

“Maybe it’s just a sprain,” I suggested. 

“Yeah,” Stanley quickly agreed. “We’d better get you to the house and put 
ice on it. Can you get back up on Maggie? I’ll ride behind you.” 

“Where’s my horse?” I asked, searching both ways along the path. I climbed 
unsteadily to my feet. 

“She galloped back to the barn,” Stanley replied, pointing. “Fastest I’ve 
seen her go in years!” 

He glanced down at the scarecrow and shuddered again. 

I took a few steps, stretching my arms and my back. “I’m okay,” I told him. 
“Take Mark on the horse. I’ll walk back.” 



Stanley eagerly started to help Mark to his feet. I could see that Stanley 
wanted to get away from here—away from the scarecrow—as fast as possible. 

I watched as they rode off down the path toward the house. Stanley sat 
behind Mark in the saddle, holding the reins, keeping Maggie at a slow, gentle 
pace. Mark held his wrist against his chest and leaned back against Stanley. 

I stretched my arms over my head again, trying to stretch the soreness from 
my back. My head ached. But other than that, I didn’t feel bad. 

“Guess I’m lucky,” I murmured out loud. 

I took a long glance at the scarecrow, sprawled facedown across the path. 
Cautiously, I walked over to it. 

I poked its side with the toe of my sneaker. 

The straw beneath the coat crinkled. 

I poked it harder, pushing my sneaker hard into the scarecrow’s middle. 

I don’t know what I expected to happen. Did I think the scarecrow would 
cry out? Try to squirm away? 

With an angry cry, I kicked the scarecrow. Hard. 

I kicked it again. 

The burlap bag head bounced on the path. The scarecrow’s ghastly painted 
grin didn’t move. 

It’s just a scarecrow, I told myself, giving it one last kick that sent straw 
falling out from the jacket front. 

Just a scarecrow that Sticks tossed onto the path. 

Mark and I could have been killed, I told myself. 

We’re lucky we weren’t. 

Sticks. It had to be Sticks. 

But why? 

This wasn’t a joke. 

Why was Sticks trying to hurt us? 



18 


Stanley and Sticks weren’t at lunch. Grandpa Kurt said they had to go into town 
for supplies. 

Mark’s wrist was only sprained. Grandma Miriam put an ice bag on it, and 
the swelling went right down. But Mark was groaning and complaining. He was 
really making the most of it. 

“Guess I’ll have to lie on the couch and watch TV for a week or so,” he 
moaned. 

Grandma Miriam served ham sandwiches and homemade coleslaw. Mark 
and I gobbled down our lunches. All that excitement had made us really hungry. 

As we ate, I decided to tell Grandpa Kurt everything that had been 
happening. I couldn’t hold it in any longer. 

I told him about how Sticks was making the scarecrows move at night. And 
how he was trying to frighten us, trying to make us think the scarecrows were 
alive. 

I caught a glimpse of fear in Grandpa Kurt’s blue eyes. But then he rubbed 
his white-stubbled cheeks, and he got a faraway look on his face. 

“Sticks and his little jokes,” he said finally, a smile spreading across his 
face. “That boy sure likes his jokes.” 

“He’s not joking,” I insisted. “He’s really trying to frighten us, Grandpa.” 

“We could have been killed this morning!” Mark joined in. He had 
mayonnaise smeared on his cheek. 

“Sticks is a good boy,” Grandma Miriam murmured. She was smiling, too. 
She and Grandpa Kurt exchanged glances. 

“Sticks wouldn’t really hurt you,” Grandpa Kurt said softly. “He just likes 
to have his fun.” 

“Great fun!” I muttered sarcastically, rolling my eyes. 

“Yeah. Great fun,” Mark groaned. “I almost broke my wrist!” 

Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam just smiled back at us, their faces 
frozen like the painted scarecrow faces. 

After lunch, Mark slumped to the couch, where he planned to spend the rest of 
the afternoon staring at the TV. He loved having an excuse not to go outdoors. 



I heard Stanley’s truck pull up the drive. I decided to go find Sticks and tell 
him how fed up we were with his stupid scarecrow tricks. 

I didn’t think his jokes were all in fun. I really believed he was trying to 
frighten us or hurt us—and I wanted to find out why. 

I didn’t see Sticks or Stanley out in the yard. So I made my way across the 
grass to the guest house where they lived. 

It was a warm, beautiful day. The sky was clear and bright. The air smelled 
fresh and sweet. 

But I couldn’t enjoy the sunshine. All I could think about was letting Sticks 
know how angry I was. 

I knocked on the guest house door. I took a deep breath and tossed my hair 
behind my shoulders, listening for signs of life inside. 

I tried to think of what I was going to say to Sticks. But I was too angry to 
plan it. My heart started to pound. I realized I was breathing hard. 

I knocked on the door again, harder this time. 

There was no one inside. 

I turned my gaze to the cornfields. The stalks stood stiffly, watched over by 
the motionless scarecrows. No sign of Sticks. 

I turned to the barn, across the wide grass from the guest house. Maybe 
Sticks is in there, I thought. 

I jogged to the barn. Two enormous crows hopped along the ground in front 
of the open barn doors. They flapped their wings hard and scrambled out of my 
way. 

“Hey—Sticks?” I shouted breathlessly as I stepped inside. 

No reply. 

The barn was dark. I waited for my eyes to adjust. 

Remembering my last creepy visit to the barn, I stepped reluctantly, my 
sneakers scraping over the straw on the floor. “Sticks? Are you in here?” I 
called, staring hard into the deep shadows. 

A rusted baling machine stood to one side of the straw bales. A 
wheelbarrow tilted against the wall. I hadn’t noticed them before. 

“Guess he isn’t here,” I said to myself out loud. 

I walked past the wheelbarrow. I saw something else I hadn’t noticed before 
—a pile of old coats on the barn floor. Empty burlap bags were stacked beside 
them. 

I picked one up. It had a frowning face painted on it in black paint. I 



dropped the bag back onto the pile. 

These must be Stanley’s scarecrow supplies, I realized. 

How many more scarecrows did he plan to build? 

Then something in the corner caught my eye. I walked quickly over the 
straw. Then I bent down to examine what I saw. 

Torches. At least a dozen torches, stacked in the corner, hidden by the 
darkness. Next to them I spotted a large bottle of kerosene. 

What on earth are these doing here? I asked myself. 

Suddenly, I heard a scraping sound. I saw shadows slide against shadows. 
And I realized that once again I was no longer alone. 

I jumped to my feet. “Sticks!” I cried. “You scared me.” 

His face was half hidden in darkness. His black hair fell over his forehead. 
He didn’t smile. “I warned you,” he said menacingly. 



19 


Feeling the fear rise to my throat, I stepped out of the corner and moved past 
him, into the light from the doorway. “I—I was looking for you,” I stammered. 
“Sticks, why are you trying to scare Mark and me?” 

“I warned you,” he said, lowering his voice to a whisper. “I warned you to 
get away from here, to go back home.” 

“But why?” I demanded. “What’s your problem, Sticks? What did we do to 
you? Why are you trying to scare us?” 

“I’m not,” Sticks replied. He glanced back nervously to the barn doors. 

“Huh?” I gaped at him. 

“I’m not trying to scare you. Really,” he insisted. 

“Liar,” I muttered angrily. “You must really think I’m a moron. I know you 
threw that scarecrow onto our path this morning. It had to be you, Sticks.” 

“I really don’t know what you’re talking about,” he insisted coldly. “But 
I’m warning you—” 

A sound at the doorway made him stop. 

We both saw Stanley step into the barn. He shielded his eyes with one hand 
as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. “Sticks—are you in here?” he called. 

Sticks’ features tightened in sudden fear. He let out a low gasp. 

“I—I’ve got to go,” Sticks whispered tensely to me. He turned and started 
jogging toward Stanley. “Here I am, Dad,” he called. “Is the tractor ready?” 

I watched the two of them hurry from the barn. Sticks didn’t look back. 

I stood in the darkness, my eyes on the empty doorway, thinking hard. 

I know Sticks was lying to me, I thought. 

I know he made the scarecrows move at night. I know he dressed as a 
scarecrow to scare me in the woods and at the barn. And I know he tossed that 
scarecrow in front of the horses this morning. 

I know he’s trying to frighten Mark and me. 

But enough is enough, I decided. 

Now it’s payback time. 

Now it’s time for Sticks to be frightened. Really frightened. 



20 


“I can’t do this!” Mark protested. 

“Of course you can,” I assured him. “This is going to be really cool.” 

“But my wrist hurts again,” my brother whined. “It just started hurting. I 
can’t use it.” 

“No problem,” I told him. “You won’t have to use it.” 

He started to protest some more. But then a smile spread across his face, 
and his eyes lit up gleefully. “It’s kind of a cool idea,” he said, laughing. 

“Of course it’s an awesome idea,” I agreed. “I thought of it!” 

We were standing in the doorway to the barn. The white light from a full 
moon shone down on us. Owls hooted somewhere nearby. 

It was a cool, clear night. The grass shimmered from a heavy dew. A soft 
wind made the trees whisper. The moonlight was so bright, I could see every 
blade of grass. 

After Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam had gone to bed, I dragged Mark 
from the house. I pulled him across the yard to the barn. 

“Wait right here,” I said. Then I hurried into the barn to get what we 
needed. 

It was a little creepy in the dark barn at night. I heard a soft fluttering sound 
high in the rafters. 

Probably a bat. 

My sneakers were wet from the grass. I slid over the straw on the barn 
floor. 

The bat swooped low over my head. I heard a high-pitched chittering up in 
the rafters. More bats. 

I grabbed one of the big, old coats from the pile. Then I pulled up one of the 
burlap bag faces and slung it on top of the coat. 

Ignoring the fluttering wings swooping back and forth, back and forth, 
across the barn, I hurried outside to Mark. 

And explained my plan, my plan to get our revenge on Sticks. 

It was actually a very simple plan. We’d dress Mark up as a scarecrow. 
He’d stand with the other scarecrows in the cornfield. 

I’d go to the guest house and get Sticks. I’d tell Sticks I saw something 



weird in the field. I’d pull Sticks out to the field. Mark would start to stagger 
toward him—and Sticks would be so freaked, he’d have a cow! 

A simple plan. And a good one. 

Sticks deserved it, too. 

I pulled the burlap bag over Mark’s head. The black, painted eyes stared 
back at me. I reached down, picked up a handful of straw, and began stuffing it 
under the bag. 

“Stop squirming!” I told Mark. 

“But the straw itches!” he cried. 

“You’ll get used to it,” I told him. I grabbed his shoulders. “Stand still. 
Don’t move.” 

“Why do I need straw?” he whined. 

“Mark, you have to look like all the other scarecrows,” I told him. 
“Otherwise, Sticks won’t be fooled.” 

I stuffed the burlap face with straw. Then I held up the old overcoat for 
Mark to put on. 

“I can’t do this!” he wailed. “I’m going to itch to death! I can’t breathe!” 

“You can breathe perfectly fine,” I told him. I stuffed straw into the sleeves. 
I was careful to let clumps of straw hang from the cuffs, covering Mark’s hands. 
Then I stuffed more straw into the jacket. 

“Will you stand still?” I whispered angrily. “This is a lot of hard work—you 
know?” 

He grumbled in a low voice to himself as I continued to work. 

“Just keep thinking how great it’ll be when Sticks sees you and thinks 
you’re a scarecrow that’s really coming to life,” I said. 

I had straw stuck to my hands, straw all down the front of my sweatshirt 
and jeans. I sneezed. Once. Twice. I’m definitely allergic to the stuff. 

But I didn’t care. I was so excited. I couldn’t wait to see Sticks’ terrified 
face. I couldn’t wait to pay him back for trying to frighten us all week. 

“I need a hat,” Mark said. He was standing stiffly, afraid to move under all 
the straw. 

“Hmmmm.” I thought hard. There weren’t any hats in the barn with the 
other scarecrow supplies. “We’ll just take one off a real scarecrow,” I told Mark. 

I stepped back to see my handiwork. Mark looked pretty good. But he still 
needed more straw. I set to work, stuffing him, making the old coat bulge. 

“Now don’t forget to stand straight and stiff, with your arms straight out,” I 



instructed. 

“Do I have a choice?” Mark complained. “I—I can’t move at all!” 

“Good,” I said. I arranged the straw that stuck out of his sleeves, then 
stepped back. “Okay. You’re ready,” I told him. 

“How do I look?” he asked. 

“Like a short scarecrow,” I told him. 

“I’m too short?” he replied. 

“Don’t worry, Mark,” I said, grabbing his arm. “I’m going to stick you up 
on a pole!” 

“Huh?” 

I laughed. “Gotcha,” I muttered. “I’m kidding.” I started to lead him to the 
cornfields. 

“Think this is going to work?” Mark asked, walking stiffly. “Think we’re 
really going to scare Sticks?” 

I nodded. An evil grin spread over my face. “I think so,” I told my brother. 
“I think Sticks is in for a terrifying surprise.” 

Little did I know that we all were! 



21 


I gripped Mark’s arm with both hands and led him to the cornfields. The bright 
moon bathed us in white light. The tall cornstalks shivered in a light breeze. 

Mark looked so much like a scarecrow, it was scary. Tufts of straw stuck 
out at his neck and the cuffs of his coat. The enormous old coat hung loosely 
over his shoulders and came down nearly to his knees. 

We stepped into the field. Our sneakers crunched over the dry ground as we 
edged through a narrow row. 

The cornstalks rose above our heads. The breeze made them lean over us, 
as if trying to close us in. 

I let out a gasp as I heard a rustling sound along the ground. 

Footsteps? 

Mark and I both froze. And listened. 

The tall stalks bent low as the wind picked up. They made an eerie creaking 
sound as they moved. The ripe corn sheaths bobbed heavily. 

Creeeeak. Creeeeak. 

The stalks shifted back and forth. 

Then we heard the rustling again. A soft brushing sound. 

Very nearby. 

“Ow. Let go!” Mark whispered. 

I suddenly realized I was still gripping his arm, squeezing it tightly. 

I let go. And listened. “Do you hear it?” I whispered to Mark. “That 
brushing sound?” 

Creeeeak. Creeeeak. 

The cornstalks leaned over us, shifting in the wind. 

A twig cracked. So nearby, I nearly jumped out of my skin. 

I held my breath. My heart was racing. 

Another soft rustling sound. I stared down at the ground, trying to follow 
the sound. 

“Oh.” 

A large gray squirrel scampered across the row and disappeared between 
the stalks. 



I burst out laughing, mostly from relief. “Just a squirrel,” I said. “Do you 
believe it? Just a squirrel!” 

Mark let out a long, relieved sigh from under the burlap bag. “Jodie, can we 
get going?” he demanded impatiently. “This thing itches like crazy!” 

He raised both hands and tried to scratch his face through the bag. But I 
quickly tugged his arms down. “Mark—stop. You’ll mess up the straw!” 

“But my face feels like a hundred bugs are crawling all over it!” he wailed. 
“And I can’t see. You didn’t cut the eyeholes big enough.” 

“Just follow me,” I muttered. “And stop complaining. You want to scare 
Sticks, don’t you?” 

Mark didn’t reply. But he let me lead him deeper into the cornfield. 

Suddenly, a black shadow fell over our path. 

I let out a sharp gasp before I realized it was the long shadow of a 
scarecrow. 

“How do you do,” I said, reaching out and shaking its straw hand. “May I 
borrow your hat?” 

I reached up and pulled the brown, floppy hat off the burlap head. Then I 
lowered it over Mark’s burlap head and pulled it down tight. 

“Hey—!” Mark protested. 

“I don’t want it to fall off,” I told him. 

“I’m never going to stop itching!” Mark whined. “Can you scratch my 
back? Please? My whole back is itching!” 

I gave the back of the old coat a few hard mbs. “Turn around,” I instructed 
him. I gave him a final inspection. 

Excellent. He looked more like a scarecrow than the scarecrows did. 

“Stand right here,” I told him, moving him into a small clearing between 
two rows of cornstalks. “Good. Now when you hear me bringing Sticks over, put 
your arms straight out. And don’t move a muscle.” 

“I know, I know,” Mark grumbled. “Think I don’t know how to be a 
scarecrow? Just hurry—okay?” 

“Okay,” I told him. I turned and made my way quickly along the shifting 
rows of cornstalks. Dry straw and leaves crackled beneath my sneakers. 

I was breathing hard by the time I reached the guest house. The doorway 
was dark. But an orange light glowed dimly behind the pulled shade in the 
window. 

I hesitated at the doorway and listened. Silence inside. 



How was I going to get Sticks to come out alone—without his father? 

I didn’t want to frighten Stanley. He was a really nice man, who would 
never think of playing mean jokes on Mark and me. And I knew how scared and 
upset he could get. 

I only wanted to frighten Sticks. To teach him a lesson. To teach him he had 
no business getting on our case just because Mark and I are “city kids”. 

The wind fluttered through my hair. I could hear the cornstalks creaking 
behind me in the fields. 

I shivered. 

Taking a deep breath, I raised my fist to knock on the door. 

But a sound behind me made me spin around. 

“Hey—!” I choked out. 

Someone was moving across the grass, half running, half stumbling. My 
eyes were all watery. It was hard to see. 

Was it Mark? 

Yes. I recognized the floppy hat, the bulky, dark overcoat falling down past 
his knees. 

What is he doing? I asked myself, watching him approach. 

Why is he following me? 

He’s going to ruin the whole joke! 

As he came closer, he raised a straw hand as if pointing at me. 

“Mark—what’s wrong?” I called in a loud whisper. 

He continued to gesture with his straw hand as he ran. 

“Mark—get back in the field!” I whispered. “You’re not supposed to follow 
me. You’re going to ruin everything! Mark—what are you doing here?” 

I motioned with both hands for him to go back to the cornfield. 

But he ignored me and kept coming, trailing straw as he ran. 

“Mark, please—go back! Go back!” I pleaded. 

But he stepped up in front of me and grabbed my shoulders. 

And as I stared into the cold, painted black eyes—I realized to my horror 
that it xvasn’t Mark! 



22 


I cried out and tried to pull away. 

But the scarecrow held on to me tightly. 

“Sticks—is that you?” I cried in a trembling voice. 

No reply. 

I stared into the blank, painted eyes. 

And realized there were no human eyes behind them. 

The straw hands scratched against my throat. 

I opened my mouth to scream. 

And the door to the guest house swung open. “Sticks—” I managed to 
choke out. 

Sticks stepped out onto the small stoop. “What on earth—!” he cried. 

He leaped off the stoop, grabbed the scarecrow by the coat shoulders—and 
heaved it to the ground. 

The scarecrow hit the ground without making a sound. It lay sprawled on its 
back, staring up at us blankly. 

“Who—who is it?” I cried, rubbing my neck where the straw hands had 
scratched it. 

Sticks bent down and jerked away the burlap scarecrow head. 

Nothing underneath. Nothing but straw. 

“It—it really is a scarecrow!” I cried in horror. “But it— walked !” 

“I warned you,” Sticks said solemnly, staring down at the headless dark 
figure. “I warned you, Jodie.” 

“You mean it wasn’t you?” I demanded. “It wasn’t you trying to scare Mark 
and me?” 

Sticks shook his head. He raised his dark eyes to mine. “Dad brought the 
scarecrows to life,” he said softly. “Last week. Before you came. He used his 
book. He chanted some words—and they all came to life.” 

“Oh, no,” I murmured, raising my hands to my face. 

“We were all so frightened,” Sticks continued. “Especially your 
grandparents. They begged Dad to recite the words and put the scarecrows back 
to sleep.” 



“Did he?” I asked. 

“Yes,” Sticks replied. “He put them back to sleep. But first he insisted your 
grandparents make some promises. They had to promise not to laugh at him 
anymore. And they had to promise to do everything he wanted from now on.” 

Sticks took a deep breath. He stared toward the guest house window. 
“Haven’t you noticed how different things are at the farm? Haven’t you noticed 
how frightened your grandparents are?” 

I nodded solemnly. “Of course I have.” 

“They’ve been trying to keep Dad happy,” Sticks continued. “They’ve been 
doing everything they can to keep him from getting upset or angry. Your 
grandmother fixes only his favorite food. Your grandfather stopped telling scary 
stories because Dad doesn’t like them.” 

I shook my head. “They’re that afraid of Stanley?” 

“They’re afraid he’ll read the chant in the book again and bring the 
scarecrows back to life,” Sticks said. He swallowed hard. “There’s only one 
problem,” he murmured. 

“What’s that?” I asked. 

“Well, I haven’t told Dad yet. But...” His voice trailed off. 

“But what?” I demanded eagerly. 

“Some of the scarecrows are still alive,” Sticks replied. “Some of them 
never went back to sleep.” 



23 


We both let out short cries as the front door to the house swung open. 

Startled, I leaped away from the doorway. 

As the door pulled open, it revealed a rectangle of orange light. Stanley 
stepped into the light. 

He held on to the door and peered out. His eyes showed surprise as they 
landed on Sticks and me. But then he goggled and uttered a choking sound as he 
spotted the headless scarecrow on the ground. 

“N-no!” Stanley sputtered. He pointed a trembling finger at the scarecrow. 
“It—it walks! The scarecrow walks!” 

“No, Dad—!” Sticks cried. 

But Stanley didn’t hear him. Stanley had already dived back into the house. 

Sticks started after him. But Stanley reappeared in the doorway. As he 
stepped outside, I saw that he was carrying the big superstition book. 

“The scarecrows walk!” Stanley screamed. “I must take charge! I must take 
charge of them all now!” 

His eyes were wild. His entire skinny body was trembling. He started 
toward the cornfields, totally crazy. Sticks tried to calm him down. 

“No, Dad!” Sticks cried desperately, hurrying after him. “The scarecrow 
was dropped here! I dropped it here, Dad! It didn’t walk! It didn’t walk!” 

Stanley kept walking, taking long, rapid strides. He didn’t seem to hear 
Sticks. “I must take charge now!” Stanley declared. “I must be the leader. I will 
bring the others back to life and take control.” 

He turned and glanced at Sticks, who was hurrying to catch up to him. 
“Stay back!” Stanley shouted. “Stay back—until I read the chant! Then you can 
follow!” 

“Dad—please listen to me!” Sticks cried. “The scarecrows are ah asleep! 
Don’t wake them!” 

Stanley finally stopped a few yards from the edge of the cornfields. He 
turned to Sticks and studied his face. “You’re sure? You’re sure they’re not out 
of my control? You’re sure they’re not walking?” 

Sticks nodded. “Yes. I’m sure, Dad. I’m really sure.” 

Stanley’s face filled with confusion. He kept staring hard at Sticks, as if not 



believing him. “I don’t have to read the chant?” Stanley asked, confused, his 
eyes on the swaying cornstalks. “I don’t have to take charge?” 

“No, Dad,” Sticks replied softly. “The scarecrows are all still. You can put 
the book away. The scarecrows are not moving.” 

Stanley sighed with relief. He lowered the book to his side. “None of 
them?” he asked warily. 

“None of them,” Sticks replied soothingly. 

And that’s when Mark—in full scarecrow costume—decided to come 
staggering out of the cornfield. 



24 


“Where’ve you been?” Mark called. 

Stanley’s eyes went wide, and he opened his mouth in a high shriek of 
terror. 

“Dad, please—!” Sticks pleaded. 

Too late. 

Stanley took off, heading into the cornfields, the big book raised high in 
front of him. “The scarecrows walk! They walk!” he cried. 

Mark tucked at the burlap bag face. “Did we blow it?” he called. “Is the 
joke over? What’s happening?” 

There was no time to answer him. 

Sticks turned to me, his features tight with fear. “We’ve got to stop Dad!” 
he cried. He started running to the swaying cornstalks. 

Stanley had already disappeared between the tall rows of corn. 

My allergies were really bad. I kept rubbing my eyes, trying to clear them. 
But as I followed Sticks, everything was a shimmering blur of grays and blacks. 

“Ow!” I cried out as I stumbled in a soft hole and fell. 

Mark, right behind me, nearly toppled over me. 

He reached down and helped pull me up. I had landed hard on both knees, 
and they were throbbing with pain. 

“Which way did they go?” I asked breathlessly, searching the dark, swaying 
rows of creaking cornstalks. 

“I—I’m not sure!” Mark stammered. “What’s going on, Jodie? Tell me!” 

“Not now!” I told him. “We have to stop Stanley. We have to—” 

Stanley’s voice, high and excited, rose up from somewhere nearby. Mark 
and I both froze as we listened to the strange words he was chanting. 

“Is he reading something from that weird book?” Mark demanded. 

Without answering, I headed in the direction of Stanley’s voice. It was easy 
to follow him. He was chanting the strange words at the top of his lungs. 

Where was Sticks? I wondered. 

Why hadn’t Sticks been able to stop his father? 

I pushed frantically through the tall stalks. I was moving blindly, my eyes 



watered over, brushing the stalks out of the way with both hands. 

In a small clearing, I found Stanley and Sticks. They were standing in front 
of two scarecrows on poles. 

Stanley held the book up close to his face as he chanted, moving his finger 
over the words. 

Sticks stood frozen, a blank expression on his face, a face of cold terror. 

Had the words of the chant somehow frozen him there like that? 

The scarecrows stood stiffly on their poles, their painted eyes staring 
lifelessly out from under their floppy black hats. 

Mark and I stepped into the clearing just as Stanley finished his chant. He 
slammed the big book shut and tucked it under one arm. 

“They’re going to walk now!” Stanley cried excitedly. “They’re going to 
come alive again!” 

Sticks suddenly seemed to come back to life. He blinked several times and 
shook his head hard, as if trying to clear it. 

We all stared at the two scarecrows. 

They stared back at us, lifeless, unmoving. 

The clouds floated away from the moon. The shadow over the cornfields 
rolled away. 

I stared into the eerie, pale light. 

A heavy silence descended over us. The only sounds I could hear were 
Stanley’s shallow breathing, tense gasps as he waited for his chant to work, for 
his scarecrows to come to life. 

I don’t know how long we stood there, none of us moving a muscle, 
watching the scarecrows. Watching. Watching. 

“It didn’t work,” Stanley moaned finally. His voice came out sad and low. 
“I did something wrong. The chant—it didn’t work.” 

A smile grew on Sticks’ face. He gazed at me. “It didn’t work!” Sticks 
exclaimed happily. 

And then I heard the scratch scratch scratch of dry straw. 

I saw the scarecrows’ shoulders start to twitch. I saw their eyes light up and 
their heads lean forward. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

The dry straw crinkled loudly as they both squirmed off their poles and 
lowered themselves silently to the ground. 



25 


“Go warn your grandparents!” Sticks cried. “Hurry! Go tell them what my dad 
has done! ” 

Mark and I hesitated. We stared at the scarecrows as they stretched their 
arms and rolled their burlap bag heads, as if waking up after a long sleep. 

“Jodie—look!” Mark choked out in a hushed whisper. He pointed out to the 
fields. 

I gasped in horror as I saw what Mark was staring at. 

All over the field, dark-coated scarecrows were stretching, squirming, 
lowering themselves from their poles. 

More than a dozen of them, silently coming to life. 

“Run!” Sticks was screaming. “Go! Tell your grandparents!” 

Stanley stood frozen in place, gripping the book in both hands. He stared in 
amazement, shaking his head, enjoying his triumph. 

Sticks’ face was knotted with fear. He gave my shoulders a hard shove. 
“Run!” 

The scarecrows were rolling their heads back and forth, stretching out their 
straw arms. The dry scratch of straw filled the night air. 

I forced myself to take my eyes off them. Mark and I turned and started 
mnning through the cornfield. We pushed the tall stalks away with both hands as 
we ran. We ducked our heads low, running in terrified silence. 

We ran across the grass, past the guest house. Past the dark, silent barn. 

The farmhouse loomed darkly ahead of us. The windows were dark. A dim 
porch light sent a circle of yellow light over the back porch. 

“Hey—!” Mark shouted, pointing. 

Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam must have heard our shouts back in the 
cornfields. They were waiting for us in the back yard. 

They looked frail and frightened. Grandma Miriam had pulled a flannel 
bathrobe over her nightdress. She had a scarf tied over her short red hair. 

Grandpa Kurt had pulled his overalls on over his pajamas. He leaned 
heavily on his cane, shaking his head as Mark and I came running up. 

“The scarecrows—!” I exclaimed breathlessly. 

“They’re walking!” Mark cried. “Stanley—he—” 



“Did you get Stanley upset?” Grandpa Kurt asked, his eyes wide with fear. 
“Who got Stanley upset? He promised us he wouldn’t do it again! He promised 
—if we didn’t upset him.” 

“It was an accident!” I told him. “We didn’t mean to. Really!” 

“We’ve worked so hard to keep Stanley happy,” Grandma Miriam said 
sadly. She chewed her lower lip. “So hard...” 

“I didn’t think he’d do it,” Grandpa Kurt said, his eyes on the cornfields. “I 
thought we convinced him it was too dangerous.” 

“Why are you dressed like that?” Grandma Miriam asked Mark. 

I was so frightened and upset, I had completely forgotten that Mark was 
still dressed as a scarecrow. 

“Mark, did you dress like that to scare Stanley?” Grandma Miriam 
demanded. 

“No!” Mark cried. “It was supposed to be a joke! Just a joke!” 

“We were trying to scare Sticks,” I told them. “But when Stanley saw Mark, 
he...” 

My voice trailed off as I saw the dark figures step out of the cornfields. 

In the silvery moonlight, I saw Stanley and Sticks. They were running hard, 
leaning forward as they ran. Stanley held the book in front of him. His shoes 
slipped and slid over the wet grass. 

Behind them came the scarecrows. They were moving awkwardly, 
staggering, lurching silently forward. 

Their straw arms stretched straight forward, as if reaching to grab Stanley 
and Sticks. Their round, black eyes glowed blankly in the moonlight. 

Staggering, tumbling, falling, they came after Stanley and Sticks. A dozen 
twisted figures in black coats and hats. Leaving clumps of straw as they pulled 
themselves forward. 

Grandma Miriam grabbed my arm and squeezed it in terror. Her hand was 
as cold as ice. 

We watched Stanley fall, then scramble to his feet. Sticks helped pull him 
up, and the two of them continued to run toward us in terror. 

The silent scarecrows lurched and staggered closer. Closer. 

“Help us— please !” Stanley called to us. 

“What can we do?” I heard Grandpa Kurt mutter sadly. 



26 


The four of us huddled close together, staring in helpless horror as the 
scarecrows made their way, chasing Stanley and Sticks across the moonlit lawn. 

Grandma Miriam held on to my arm. Grandpa Kurt leaned heavily, 
squeezing the handle of his cane. 

“They won’t obey me!” Stanley screamed breathlessly. He stopped in front 
of us, holding the book in one hand. 

His chest was heaving up and down as he struggled to catch his breath. 
Despite the coolness of the night, sweat poured down his forehead. 

“They won’t obey me! They must obey me! The book says so!” Stanley 
cried, frantically waving the book in the air. 

Sticks stopped beside his father. He turned to watch the scarecrows 
approach. “What are you going to do?” he asked his father. “You have to do 
something!” 

“They’re alive!” Stanley shrieked. “Alive!” 

“What does the book say?” Grandpa Kurt demanded. 

“They’re alive! They’re all alive!” Stanley repeated, his eyes wild with 
fright. 

“Stanley—listen to me!” Grandpa Kurt yelled. He grabbed Stanley by the 
shoulders and spun him around to face him. “Stanley—what does the book say 
to do? How do you get them in control?” 

“Alive,” Stanley murmured, his eyes rolling in his head. “They’re all alive.” 

“Stanley—what does the book say to do?” Grandpa Kurt demanded once 
again. 

“I—I don’t know,” Stanley replied. 

We turned back to the scarecrows. They were moving closer. Spreading out. 
Forming a line as they staggered toward us. Their arms reached forward 
menacingly, as if preparing to grab us. 

Clumps of straw fell from their sleeves. Straw spilled from their coats. 

But they continued to lurch toward us. Closer. Closer. 

The black, painted eyes stared straight ahead. They leered at us with their 
ugly, painted mouths. 

“Stop!” Stanley screamed, raising the book high over his head. “I command 



you to stop!” 

The scarecrows lurched slowly, steadily forward. 

“Stop!” Stanley shrieked in a high, frightened voice. “I brought you to life! 
You are mine! Mine! I command you! I command you to stop!” 

The blank eyes stared straight at us. The arms reached stiffly forward. The 
scarecrows pulled themselves closer. Closer. 

“Stop! I said stop!” Stanley screeched. 

Mark edged closer to me. Behind his burlap mask I could see his eyes. 
Terrified eyes. 

Ignoring Stanley’s frightened pleas, the scarecrows dragged themselves 
closer. Closer. 

And then I did something that changed the whole night. 

I sneezed. 



27 


Mark was so startled by my sudden, loud sneeze that he let out a short cry and 
jumped away from me. 

To my amazement, the scarecrows all stopped moving forward—and 
jumped back, too. 

“Whoa!” I cried. “What’s going on here?” 

The scarecrows all seemed to have trained their painted eyes on Mark. 

“Mark—quick—raise your right hand!” I cried. 

Mark gazed at me through the burlap bag. I could see confusion in his eyes. 

But he obediently raised his right hand high over his head. 

And the scarecrows all raised their right hands! 

“Mark—they’re imitating you!” Grandma Miriam cried. 

Mark raised both hands in the air. 

The scarecrows copied him again. I heard the scratch of straw as they lifted 
both arms. 

Mark tilted his head to the left. The scarecrows tilted their heads to the left. 

Mark dropped to his knees. The scarecrows sank in their straw, slaves to my 
brother’s every move. 

“They—they think you’re one of them,” Grandpa Kurt whispered. 

“They think you’re their leader !” Stanley cried, staring wide-eyed at the 
scarecrows slumped on the ground. 

“But how do I make them go back to their poles?” Mark demanded 
excitedly. “How do I make them go back to being scarecrows?” 

“Dad—find the right chant!” Sticks yelled. “Find the right words! Make 
them sleep again!” 

Stanley scratched his short, dark hair. “I—I’m too scared!” he confessed 
sadly. 

And then I had an idea. 

“Mark—” I whispered, leaning close to him. “Pull off your head.” 

“Huh?” He gazed at me through the burlap mask. 

“Pull off your scarecrow head,” I urged him, still whispering. 

“But why?” Mark demanded. He waved his hands in the air. The 



scarecrows obediently waved their straw hands in the air. 

Everyone was staring at me, eager to hear my explanation. 

“If you pull off your scarecrow head,” I told Mark, “then they will pull off 
their heads. And they’ll die.” 

Mark hesitated. “Huh? You think so?” 

“It’s worth a try,” Grandpa Kurt urged. 

“Go ahead, Mark. Hurry!” Sticks cried. 

Mark hesitated for a second. Then he stepped forward, just inches from the 
dark-coated scarecrows. 

“Hurry!” Sticks urged him. 

Mark gripped the top of the burlap bag with both hands. “I sure hope this 
works,” he murmured. Then he gave the bag a hard tug and pulled it off. 



28 


The scarecrows stopped moving. They stood still as statues as they watched 
Mark pull off his scarecrow head. 

Mark stared back at them, holding the burlap bag between his hands. His 
hair was matted wetly to his forehead. He was dripping with sweat. 

The scarecrows hesitated for a moment more. 

A long, silent moment. 

I held my breath. My heart was pounding. 

Then I let out a happy cry as the scarecrows all reached up with their straw 
hands—and pulled off their heads! 

The dark hats and burlap heads fell silently to the grass. 

None of us moved. We were waiting for the scarecrows to fall. 

Waiting for the headless scarecrows to collapse and fall. 

But they didn’t go down. 

Instead, they reached out their arms and moved stiffly, menacingly forward. 

“They—they’re coming to get us!” Stanley cried in a high, trembling voice. 

“Mark —do something!” I shouted, shoving him forward. “Make them stand 
on one foot or hop up and down. Stop them!” 

The headless figures dragged themselves toward us, arms outstretched. 

Mark stepped forward. He raised both hands over his head. 

The scarecrows didn’t stop, didn’t copy him. 

“Hey—hands up!” Mark shouted desperately. He waved his hands above 
his head. 

The scarecrows edged forward, silently, steadily. 

“Th-they’re not doing it!” Mark wailed. “They’re not following me!” 

“You don’t look like a scarecrow anymore,” Grandma Miriam added. “They 
don’t think you’re their leader.” 

Closer they came, staggering blindly. Closer. 

They formed a tight circle around us. 

A scarecrow brushed its straw hand against my cheek. 

I uttered a terrified cry. “Noooooo!” 

It reached for my throat, the dry straw scratching me, scratching my face, 



scratching, scratching. 

The headless scarecrows swarmed over Mark. He thrashed and kicked. But 
they were smothering him, forcing him to the ground. 

My grandparents cried out helplessly as the dark-coated figures surrounded 
them. Stanley let out a silent gasp. 

“Sticks—help me!” I shrieked as the straw hands wrapped around my neck. 
“Sticks? Sticks?” 

I glanced frantically around. 

“Sticks? Help me! Please! Where are you?” 

Then I realized to my horror that Sticks was gone. 



29 


“Sticks?” I let out a final muffled cry. 

The straw hands wrapped around my throat. The scarecrow rolled over me. 
My face was pressed into the dry straw of its chest. 

I tried to squirm free. But it held on, surrounded me, choked me. 

The straw smelled sour. Decayed. I felt sick. A wave of nausea swept over 
me. 

“Let go! Let go!” I heard Stanley pleading. 

The scarecrow was surprisingly strong. It wrapped its arms around me 
tightly, smothering me in the disgusting straw. 

I made one last attempt to pull free. Struggling with all my might, I raised 
my head. 

And saw two balls of fire. Orange streaks of light. 

Floating closer. 

And in the orange light, I saw Sticks’ face, hard and determined. 

I gave another hard tug. And tumbled backwards. 

“Sticks!” I cried. 

He was carrying two blazing torches. The torches from the barn, I realized. 
“I was saving these just in case!” Sticks called. 

The scarecrows seemed to sense danger. 

They let go of us, tried to scramble away. 

But Sticks moved quickly. 

He swept the two torches, swinging them like baseball bats. 

A scarecrow caught fire. Then another. 

Sticks made another wide swing. 

The fire crackled, a streak of orange against the darkness. 

The dry straw burst into flame. The old coats burned quickly. 

The scarecrows twisted and writhed as the bright flames danced over them. 
They sank to their backs on the ground. Burning. Burning so brightly, so silently, 
so fast. 

I took a step back, staring in horror and fascination. 

Grandpa Kurt had his arm around Grandma Miriam. They leaned close 



together, their faces reflecting the flickering flames. 

Stanley stood tensely, his eyes wide. He hugged the book tightly to his 
chest. He was murmuring to himself, but I couldn’t make out the words. 

Mark and I stood beside Sticks, who held a torch in each hand, watching 
with narrowed eyes as the scarecrows burned. 

In seconds, there was nothing left but clumps of dark ashes on the ground. 

“It’s over,” Grandma Miriam murmured softly, gratefully. 

“Never again,” I heard Stanley mutter. 

The house was quiet the next afternoon. 

Mark was out on the screen porch, lying in the hammock, reading a stack of 
comic books. Grandpa Kurt and Grandma Miriam had gone in for their 
afternoon nap. 

Sticks had driven into town to pick up the mail. 

Stanley sat at the kitchen table, reading his superstition book. His finger 
moved over the page as he muttered the words aloud in a low voice. 

“Never again,” he had repeated at lunch. “I’ve learned my lesson about this 
book. I’ll never try to bring any scarecrows to life again. I won’t even read the 
part about scarecrows!” 

We were all glad to hear that. 

So now, on this lazy, peaceful afternoon, Stanley sat at the table, quietly 
reading some chapter of the big book. 

And I sat alone on the couch in the living room, hearing Stanley’s gentle 
murmurings from the kitchen, thinking about the night before. 

It felt good to have a quiet afternoon, to be all alone to think about what had 
happened. 

All alone... 

The only one in the room... 

The only one to hear Stanley’s low mumbling as he read the book. 

The only one to see the gigantic stuffed brown bear blink its eyes. 

The only one to see the bear lick its lips, step off its platform, snarl and paw 
the air with its enormous claws. 

The only one to hear its stomach growl as it stared down at me. 

The only one to see the hungry look on its face as it magically came out of 
its long hibernation. 

“Stanley?” I called in a tiny, high voice. “Stanley? What chapter have you 
been reading?” 




GO EAT WORMS! 
Goosebumps - 21 
R.L. Stine 


1 


Before the worms turned mean, before they slithered out to get their revenge, 
Todd Barstow had a great time with them. 

Todd collected worms. He built a worm farm in his basement. 

He studied them. He played with them. He did experiments with them. 
Sometimes he carried them around with him. 

Sometimes he scared people with them. Especially his sister, Regina. 

He liked to dangle the long, purple ones in front of Regina’s face. 
Sometimes he dropped them down her back or into her long, brown hair. 

He liked to torture Regina’s best friend, too. Her name was Beth Baker, and 
she always screamed a high, squeaky scream whenever Todd surprised her with 
a big, slimy worm. 

“You’re totally gross, Todd!” Beth would squeal. 

This always made Todd very happy. 

Todd’s best friend, Danny Fletcher, didn’t really understand why Todd was 
so interested in worms. But Danny did understand how much fun it was to 
surprise people and make them scream. So he spent a lot of time with Todd. 

In fact, the two of them were almost always together. They even sat 
together in Miss Grant’s class, where they whispered a lot, planning what to do 
next with Todd’s worms. 

Todd didn’t look at all mischievous. In fact, he usually had a very serious 
expression on his face. He had dark brown eyes under short, wavy brown hair. 
No one ever saw his hair. It was always covered by the silver-and-black Raiders 
cap he wore day and night. 

He was tall and skinny. His mother said he was as skinny as a worm. Todd 
never thought that was funny. He took worms seriously. 

Danny looked more like a joker. He had a round, chubby face under curly 
red hair, and a really goofy grin. His round blue eyes always lit up when Todd 
was about to spring a big, wet worm on an unsuspecting victim. 

Whenever Todd succeeded in making someone scream in surprise, Danny 
would toss back his head, let out a high-pitched cheer, and slap Todd hard on the 
back with his chubby, freckled hand. Then the two of them would screech with 
laughter, roll around on the floor, and enjoy their victory. 



They had a great time with worms. 

But whenever anyone asked Todd why he collected them, and why he was 
so interested in them, Todd’s expression would turn serious, and he’d say, 
“Because I want to be a scientist when I grow up.” 

“How many worms do you have?” someone asked him. 

“Not enough,” he replied. 

He was always digging up more. Looking for champions. He liked them 
long and purple and kind of fat. 

And squishy. Squishy was very important. 

Sunday night it had rained. The ground was still wet as Todd and Regina walked 
to school on Monday morning. Todd knew the worms would all be coming up 
for air. 

He found Danny at the water fountain outside their classroom. Danny had a 
finger pressed over the fountain spout, and when kids passed by, he made the 
water squirt all over them. 

Todd lowered his Raiders cap over his forehead as he leaned close to 
Danny. “Meet me behind second base on the playground,” he whispered. “As 
soon as the lunch bell rings.” 

Danny nodded. He didn’t have to ask why. He knew that Todd’s favorite 
place to dig up fresh worms was the bare patch of ground behind second base on 
the softball diamond. 

The ground there was soft and rich. And after a good rain, the two boys 
could shovel up ten to fifteen worms without even trying. 

Todd kept a gardening shovel in his locker, as well as a small metal bucket 
with a lid. He was always ready to collect worms when the time was right. 

In class that morning, everyone was talking about the big Science Expo to 
be held in the gym on Saturday. Some kids already had their projects done. 

Debby Brewster was bragging about how she was going to win the new 
computer, the grand prize, by making electricity. Someone shouted out, “Go fly a 
kite!” and everyone laughed. The whole class was tired of Debby’s constant 
bragging. 

Todd’s project was just about finished. It had worms in it, of course. 

It was a worm house. A little house Todd’s father had helped him build, 
about the size of a dollhouse. One side was cut away and covered with a pane of 
glass so you could see in. The house was filled with dirt. And you could see all 



of the worms—a whole worm family—crawling from room to room. 

Danny’s project was really boring. He was building the solar system out of 
balloons. 

He wanted to share Todd’s project and work on it with him. But Todd 
wouldn’t let him. “I don’t want to share the computer,” Todd had said. 

“But I helped you dig up the worms!” Danny protested. 

“I dug up most of them,” Todd replied. 

And so Todd forced Danny to do his own project. Danny blew up different- 
colored balloons for all the planets and taped them on a big black sheet of 
oaktag. 

Very boring. 

“What makes you so sure you’re going to win the grand prize?” Danny asked 
Todd as he hurried to catch up with him on the playground at lunchtime. 

“I checked out the other projects,” Todd replied. “My project is the only one 
with real, living creatures. Except for Heather’s snails.” 

“Heather has done a lot of experiments with her snails,” Danny commented. 

“So what?” Todd snapped. “Snails are for babies. We had snails in first 
grade. No one cares about snails in sixth grade. No way they can compete with 
worms.” 

“I guess you’re right,” Danny replied, scratching his red hair. 

They squatted down as they reached the bare spot behind second base. Todd 
handed Danny his spare shovel. 

The playground was empty. Everyone else was inside eating lunch. 

The ground was still soft and wet. Worms were poking their heads up from 
little puddles. One long worm crawled on top of the dirt. 

“The rain makes them all come up,” said Todd, beginning to dig. “This is 
excellent!” 

He didn’t know what kind of trouble was waiting under the ground.

“Look out. You cut that one in two,” Todd warned. 

Danny grinned. “So what? Now you’ve got two little ones.” 

“But I only like big ones,” Todd replied, carefully sliding his shovel under a 
long, fat worm. 

“How many more do you need? My stomach is growling,” Danny 
complained, glancing back at the long, redbrick school building. 

“Just a few more,” Todd said, lowering the fat worm into the bucket. “He’s 
a squirmer, isn’t he?” 

Danny groaned. “Everyone else is eating lunch, and I’m out here digging in 
the mud.” 

“It’s for science,” Todd said seriously. 

“This one is as big as a snake. Did you ever think of collecting snakes?” 
Danny asked. 

“No,” Todd replied quickly, digging deep into the mud. “No way.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because I like worms,” Todd said. 

“What’s the real reason?” Danny demanded. 

“My parents won’t let me,” Todd muttered. 

The two boys continued to dig for another few minutes until the ground 
started to rumble. Danny dropped his shovel. 

“What’s that?” he asked. 

“Huh?” Todd didn’t seem to notice. 

The ground rumbled a little harder. This time everything shook. 

Todd pitched forward, dropping onto his hands and knees. He gazed up at 
Danny, surprised. “Hey—don’t push me.” 

“I didn’t!” Danny protested. 

“Then what—?” Todd started. But the ground shook again. And the dirt 
made a soft cracking sound. 

“I—I don’t like this!” Danny stammered. 

Without another word, both boys started to run. 

But the ground trembled again, and the cracking sound beneath their 



sneakers grew louder. Closer. 

“Earthquake!” Todd screamed. “Earthquake!”

Todd and Danny sprinted across the field and the playground and burst into the 
lunchroom. 

Both boys had red faces. Both of them were breathing hard. 

“Earthquake!” Todd shouted. “It’s an earthquake!” 

Chairs scraped. Conversations stopped. Everyone turned to stare at the two 
of them. 

“Duck under the tables!” Danny screamed shrilly. “Quick, everyone! The 
ground is shaking!” 

“Earthquake! Earthquake!” 

Everyone just laughed. 

No one moved. 

No one wanted to fall for a dumb practical joke. 

Todd spotted Beth and Regina across the lunchroom at the window. He and 
Danny darted over to them. 

“Get away from the window!” Todd warned. 

“The ground is cracking apart!” Danny cried. 

Regina’s mouth dropped open. She didn’t know whether to believe them or 
not. Regina, the worrier, was always ready to believe a disaster waited just 
around the corner. 

But all the other kids in the huge lunchroom were laughing their heads off. 

“We don’t get earthquakes in Ohio,” Beth said simply, making a disgusted 
face at Todd. 

“But—but—but—” Todd sputtered. 

“Didn’t you feel it?” Danny demanded breathlessly, his round, chubby face 
still bright red. “Didn’t you feel the ground shake?” 

“We didn’t feel anything,” Beth replied. 

“Didn’t you hear it?” Todd cried. “I—I was so freaked, I dropped all my 
worms.” He sank into the chair next to his sister. 

“No one believes you. It’s a dumb joke, Todd,” Regina told him. “Better 
luck next time, guys.” 

“But—but—” 



Regina turned away from her sputtering brother and started talking to Beth 
again. “As I was saying, his head is way too big for his body.” 

“He looks okay to me,” Beth replied. 

“No. We’ll have to cut his head off,” Regina insisted, frowning into her 
bowl of noodle soup. 

“Major surgery?” Beth asked. “Are you sure? If we cut his head off, it’ll 
show. It really will.” 

“But if his head is too big, what choice do we have?” Regina whined. 

“Huh? What are you talking about?” Todd demanded. “What about the 
earthquake?” 

“Todd, we’re talking about our science fair project,” Beth said impatiently. 

“Yeah. Go out and play in the earthquake!” Regina snapped. “We’ve got 
problems with Christopher Robin.” 

Todd snickered. “What a dumb name for a bird.” 

Regina stuck out her tongue at him and then turned her back. She and Beth 
began discussing their project again. 

They both agreed they probably should have tried something a little easier. 
And smaller. 

They were building an enormous robin out of papier-mache. It was 
supposed to be lifelike in every detail, except size. 

But the girls quickly discovered that papier-mache isn’t the most lifelike 
material around. It was hard to get the wings to stick to the body. It was even 
harder to get the huge round body to stand on the spindly wooden legs. 

And now Regina was convinced that the bird’s head was much too big for 
its body. 

They had used an entire quart of orange paint on the bird’s chest. Now, if 
they had to cut the head off and make a new one, the paint job would be ruined! 

“Maybe we could just shave a little off the top,” Beth suggested, taking the 
last potato chip from her bag and crinkling the bag between her hands. “Can I 
have some of your soup?” 

“You can finish it,” Regina replied, sliding the bowl across the table. “I’m 
not very hungry.” 

“There’s going to be an aftershock,” Todd warned, staring out the window. 

“Yeah. There’s always an aftershock after an earthquake,” Danny agreed. 

“I can’t believe you’re sitting here calmly, talking about your dumb 
project,” Todd said. 



“It’s not a dumb project!” Beth replied angrily. 

“Todd, go eat worms!” Regina exclaimed. It was her favorite thing to say to 
her brother. She said it at least ten times a day. 

“Beth is already eating worms,” Todd said, gazing down at the bowl of 
soup. 

Danny laughed. 

“Give me a break, Todd,” Beth muttered, rolling her eyes. 

“No. Really,” Todd insisted. “What kind of soup is that?” 

“Chicken noodle,” Beth replied warily. She took a spoonful, slurping the 
soup off the spoon. 

“Well, there’s a worm in your soup,” Todd said with a serious face. 

“Todd, you’re not funny,” Beth replied. “Give up.” 

“Want to bet?” Todd challenged. 

“Bet? What do you mean ‘bet’?” Beth said. 

“I’ll bet you a dollar there’s a worm in your soup,” Todd told her, his dark 
eyes lighting up. 

Danny leaned across the table, a wide grin frozen on his chubby face. 
“Yummm,” he said, licking his lips. “Abig fat purple one! Can I have a taste?” 

“You guys are jerks,” Regina muttered. 

“Bet a dollar?” Todd challenged, ignoring his sister. 

“Sure. It’s a bet,” Beth said. 

She reached across the table and shook Todd’s hand to seal the bet. Then 
she ran the soup spoon through the bowl several times to show him there was no 
worm. 

Todd reached under the table. Then a smile crossed his face as he brought 
his hand up—and dropped a fat purple worm into Beth’s soup. 

The worm wriggled and squirmed as it hit the hot soup. 

“Oooh, gross!” Beth screamed. 

Danny let out a loud laugh and slapped Todd gleefully on the back, nearly 
knocking Todd from the chair. 

“Pay up, Beth,” Todd demanded. “You lost the bet.” 

“You guys are sick,” Regina murmured, making a disgusted face, forcing 
herself not to look into the soup bowl. 

“Gross! Gross!” Beth was shrieking. 

The worm slipped and swam through the noodles. 

“You said you dropped your worms outside,” Regina accused angrily. 



Todd shrugged, a big grin on his face. “I lied!” 

Danny laughed even harder. He pounded the table gleefully with his fists, 
making the soup bowl bounce up and down. 

“Hey!” Suddenly Todd’s smile faded. He stared out of the lunchroom 
window at the playground. 

“Look!” He hit Danny’s shoulder, then pointed out toward second base, to 
the bare spot behind the base. “What’s going on out there?” he cried.

Todd walked over to the window and peered out, pressing his nose against the 
glass. “What is Patrick MacKay doing in my worm-digging spot?” he demanded 
angrily. 

Danny stepped beside Todd. He squinted out into the gray afternoon. “Are 
you sure that’s Patrick MacKay?” 

The sky darkened as the low clouds gathered. The boy on the playground 
was half covered by shadow. But Todd recognized him anyway. 

That snobby, stuck-up, rich kid. Patrick MacKay. 

He was bent over the bare spot of mud behind second base, working 
feverishly. 

“What is he doing out there?” Todd repeated. “That’s my best worm spot!” 

“He’s digging up worms, too!” Regina declared from the table. 

“Huh?” Todd spun around to find his sister smirking at him. 

“Patrick is digging up worms for the Science Expo,” she told him, unable to 
hide her joy. “He’s doing a worm project, too.” 

“But he can’t!” Todd sputtered in a high, shrill voice. 

“Whoa! What a copycat!” Danny declared. 

“He can’t do a worm project! I’m doing the worm project!” Todd insisted, 
turning back to stare at Patrick through the glass. 

“It’s a free country,” Regina replied smugly. She and Beth laughed and 
slapped each other high fives. They were enjoying seeing Todd squirm for a 
change. 

“But he’s not into worms!” Todd continued, very upset. “He doesn’t collect 
worms! He doesn’t study worms! He’s just copying me!” 

“Look at him, digging in your spot,” Danny murmured, shaking his head 
bitterly. 

“Patrick is a nice guy,” Beth remarked. “He doesn’t act like a jerk and put 
worms in people’s soup.” 

“He’s a jerk,” Todd insisted angrily, staring hard out the window. “He’s a 
total jerk.” 

“He’s a copycat jerk,” Danny added. 

“His worm project is going to be better than yours,” Regina teased him. 



Todd’s dark eyes burned into his sister’s. “You know what it is? You know 
what Patrick’s project is?” 

Regina had a smug smile on her lips. She tossed back her brown hair. Then 
she made a zipper sign, moving her fingers across her lips. “I’ll never tell,” she 
said. 

“What is it?” Todd demanded. “Tell me.” 

Regina shook her head. 

“Tell me, Beth,” Todd insisted, narrowing his eyes menacingly at Beth. 

“No way,” Beth replied, glancing merrily at Regina. 

“Then I’ll ask him myself,” Todd declared. “Come on, Danny.” 

The two boys started running through the lunchroom. They were nearly to 
the door when Todd ran into their teacher. 

Miss Grant was carrying her lunch tray high over her head, stepping around 
a group of kids in the aisle. Todd just didn’t see her. 

He bumped her from behind. 

She uttered a cry of surprise—and her tray flew out of her hands. The tray 
and the plates clattered loudly onto the floor. And her food—salad and a bowl of 
spaghetti—dropped around her feet. 

“What is your hurry, young man?” she snapped at Todd. 

“Uh... sorry,” Todd murmured. It was the only reply he could think of. 

Miss Grant bent to examine her brown shoes, which were now orange, 
covered with wet clumps of spaghetti. 

“It was an accident,” Todd said impatiently, fiddling with his Raiders cap. 

“It sure was,” the teacher replied coldly. “Perhaps I should speak to you 
after school about why we don’t run in the lunchroom?” 

“Perhaps,” Todd agreed. Then he bolted past her, running out the door 
faster than he had ever run. 

“Cool move, ace!” Danny exclaimed, running beside him. 

“It wasn’t my fault,” Todd told him. “She stepped in front of me.” 

“The bell is going to ring,” Danny warned as they made their way out the 
back door. 

“I don’t care,” Todd replied breathlessly. “I’ve got to find out what that 
copycat is doing with worms!” 

Patrick was still bent over the mud behind second base. He was scooping up 
worms with a silvery trowel that looked brand-new, then dropping them into a 
metal bait can. 



He was a slim, good-looking boy with wavy blond hair and blue eyes. He 
had started school in September. His family had moved to Ohio from Pasadena. 
He was always telling everyone how California was so much better. 

He didn’t brag about how rich he was. But he wore designer jeans, and his 
mother brought him to school every morning in a long, white Lincoln. So Todd 
and the others at William Tecumseh Sherman Middle School figured it out. 

Patrick was in Regina’s class. A few weeks after school started, he’d had a 
big birthday party and invited everyone in his class. Including Regina. 

She reported that Patrick had a whole carnival, with rides and everything, in 
his back yard. Todd pretended he didn’t care that he wasn’t invited. 

The sky grew even darker as Danny and Todd stood over Patrick on the 
playground. “What are you doing, Patrick?” Todd demanded. 

“Digging,” Patrick replied, glancing up from his work. 

“Digging up worms?” Todd asked, his hands pressed against the waist of 
his jeans. 

Patrick nodded. He started digging again. He pulled up a long, dark brown 
one that Todd would have loved to own. 

“I’m doing a worm project,” Todd told him. 

“I know,” Patrick replied, concentrating on his work. “Me, too.” 

“What is it?” Danny chimed in. “What’s your project, Patrick?” 

Patrick didn’t reply. He dug up a tiny, pale worm, examined it, and tossed it 
back. 

“What’s your project? Tell us,” Todd demanded. 

“You really want to know?” Patrick asked, raising his blue eyes to them. 
The wind ruffled his blond hair, but the hair immediately fell back into place. 

Todd felt a raindrop on his shoulder. Then one on the top of his head. 

“What’s your project?” Todd repeated. 

“Okay, okay,” Patrick said, wiping dirt off his hands. “I’ll tell you. My 
project is...”

The class bell rang. The sharp clang cut through the rising wind. The rain started 
to patter loudly against the ground. 

“We’ve got to go in,” Danny urged, tugging at Todd’s sleeve. 

“Wait,” Todd said, his eyes on Patrick. “Tell me now!” he insisted. 

“But we’ll be late!” Danny insisted, tugging at Todd again. “And we’re 
getting soaked.” 

Patrick climbed to his feet. “I think I’ve got all the worms I need.” He 
shook wet dirt off the silvery trowel. 

“So what is your worm project?” Todd repeated, ignoring the pattering rain 
and Danny’s urgent requests to get back inside the school. 

Patrick grinned at him, revealing about three hundred perfect, white teeth. 
“I’m teaching them to fly,” he said. 

“Huh?” 

“I’m putting cardboard wings on them and teaching them to fly. Wait till 
you see it! It’s a riot!” He burst out laughing. 

Danny leaned close to Todd. “Is he for real?” he whispered. 

“Of course not!” Todd shot back. “Don’t be a jerk, Danny. He’s goofing on 

us.” 

“Hey—you’re not funny,” Danny told Patrick angrily. 

“We’re late, guys. Let’s get going,” Patrick said, his grin fading. He started 
toward the school building. 

But Todd moved quickly to block his path. “Tell me the truth, Patrick. What 
are you planning to do?” 

Patrick started to reply. 

But a low rumbling sound made him stop. 

They all heard it. A muffled roar that made the ground shake. 

The worm can fell out of Patrick’s hand. His blue eyes opened wide in 
surprise—and fear. 

The rumbling gave way to a loud, cracking noise. It sounded as if the whole 
playground were splitting apart. 

“Wh-what’s happening ?” Patrick stammered. 



“Run!” Todd screamed as the ground trembled and shook. “Run for your

“Why are you so late? Where’ve you been? In another earthquake?” Regina 
teased. 

“Ha-ha,” Todd said bitterly. “Danny and I weren’t making it up. It happened 
again! And Patrick was there, too.” 

“How come no one else felt it?” Regina demanded. “I had the radio on after 
school. And there was nothing about an earthquake on the news.” 

It was nearly five o’clock. Todd had found his sister in the garage, up on an 
aluminum ladder, working hard on her giant robin. Somehow she had managed 
to get clumps of papier-mache in her hair and down the front of her T-shirt. 

“I don’t want to talk about the earthquake,” Todd muttered, stepping into 
the garage. “I know I’m right.” 

The rain had ended just before school let out. But the driveway was still 
puddled with water. 

His wet sneakers squeaked as he made his way to Regina’s ladder. 

“Where’s Beth?” he asked. 

“She had to go get her braces tightened,” Regina told him, concentrating on 
smoothing out the papier-mache beak. She let out a loud groan. “I can’t get this 
beak smooth.” 

Todd kicked dejectedly at an old tire that leaned against the garage wall. 

“Look out!” Regina called. 

A wet clump of papier-mache landed at Todd’s feet with a plop. “You 
missed me!” he cried, ducking away. 

“So? Where’ve you been?” Regina asked. 

“Miss Grant kept me after school. She gave me a long lecture.” 

“About what?” Regina stopped to examine her work. 

“I don’t know. Something about running in school,” Todd replied. “How are 
you going to get this dumb bird to the science fair?” 

“Carry it,” Regina answered without hesitating. “It’s big, but it’s really 
light. I don’t suppose you would help Beth and me?” 

“I don’t suppose,” Todd told her, wrapping his hand around the broomstick 
that formed one bird leg. 

“Hey—get your paws off!” Regina cried. “Leave it alone!” 



Todd obediendy backed away. 

“You’re just jealous because Christopher Robin is going to win the 
computer,” Regina said. 

“Listen, Reggie—you’ve got to tell me what Patrick MacKay is doing for 
his worm project,” Todd pleaded. “You’ve got to.” 

She climbed down off the ladder. She saw the big worm in Todd’s hand. 
“What’s that for?” she demanded. 

“Nothing.” Todd’s cheeks turned pink. 

“You planned to drop that down my back, didn’t you?” Regina accused 

him. 

“No. I was just taking it for a walk,” Todd told her. He laughed. 

“You’re a creep,” Regina said, shaking her head. “Don’t you ever get tired 
of those dumb worms?” 

“No,” Todd replied. “So tell me. What’s Patrick’s project?” 

“You want to hear the truth?” Regina asked. 

“Yeah.” 

“The truth is, I don’t know,” his sister confessed. “I really don’t know what 
he’s doing.” 

Todd stared hard at her for a long moment. “You really don’t?” 

She crossed her heart. “I really don’t know.” 

Todd suddenly had an idea. “Where does he live?” he asked eagerly. 

The question caught Regina by surprise. “Why?” 

“Danny and I can go over there tonight,” Todd said. “And I’ll ask him what 
he’s doing.” 

“You’re going to go to his house?” Regina asked. 

“I’ve got to find out!” Todd exclaimed. “I’ve worked so hard on my worm 
house, Reggie. I don’t want Patrick the Copycat to do something better.” 

Regina eyed her brother thoughtfully. “And what will you do for me if I tell 
you where he lives?” 

A grin spread over Todd’s face. He held up the worm. “If you tell me, I 
won’t put this down your back.” 

“Ha-ha,” Regina replied, rolling her eyes. “You’re a real pal, Todd.” 

“Tell me!” he insisted eagerly, grabbing her by the shoulders. 

“Okay, okay. Don’t have a cow. Patrick lives on Glen Cove,” Regina 
replied. “I think the number is 100. It’s a huge, old mansion. Behind a tall 
fence.” 



“Thanks!” Todd said. “Thanks a lot!” 

Then, as Regina bent down to pick up the globs of papier-mache from the 
garage floor, he dropped the worm down the back of her T-shirt.

“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Danny complained. “My parents said I 
couldn’t come over. As soon as they went grocery shopping, I ducked out. But if 
they catch me...” His voice trailed off. 

“We’ll be back home in fifteen minutes,” Todd said. He shifted gears and 
pedaled the bike harder. Danny’s old bike splashed through a deep puddle at the 
curb. 

The rain clouds had rolled away. But the wind still gusted, cool and damp. 
The sun had set about an hour before. Now a thin sliver of moon hung low in the 
evening sky. 

“Where is the house? On Glen Cove?” Danny asked, out of breath. 

Todd nodded. He shifted gears again. He liked shifting back and forth. It 
was a new bike, and he still hadn’t gotten used to so many gears. 

A car rolled toward them rapidly, the glare of its white headlights forcing 
them to shield their eyes. Danny’s bike rolled up onto the curb, and he nearly 
toppled over. “Why’d they have their brights on?” he griped. 

“Beats me,” Todd replied. 

They turned sharply onto Glen Cove. It was a wide street of old houses set 
back on broad, sloping lawns. The houses were set far apart, separated by dark 
wooded areas. 

“No streetlights,” Danny commented. “You’d think rich people could afford 
streetlights.” 

“Maybe they like it dark,” Todd replied thoughtfully. “You know. It helps 
keep people away.” 

“It’s kind of creepy here,” Danny said softly, leaning over his handlebars. 

“Don’t be a wimp. Look for 100,” Todd said sharply. “That’s Patrick’s 
address.” 

“Wow. Check out that house!” Danny said, slowing down and pointing. “It 
looks like a castle!” 

“I think 100 must be on the next block,” Todd called, eagerly pedaling 
ahead. 

“What are we going to say to Patrick?” Danny asked, breathing hard, 
struggling to catch up. 



“I’m just going to ask him if we can see his worm project,” Todd replied, 
his eyes searching the darkness for address signs. “Maybe I’ll act like I want to 
help him out. You know. Give him a few tips on how to take care of the worms.” 

“Nice guy,” Danny teased. He chuckled to himself. “What if Patrick says 

no?” 

Todd didn’t reply. He hadn’t thought of that. 

He squeezed the hand brake. “Look.” He pointed to an enormous house 
behind a tall iron fence. “That’s his house.” 

Danny’s brakes squealed as he brought his bike to a stop. He lowered his 
feet to the wet pavement. “Wow.” 

The house rose up over the broad, tree-filled lawn, black against the purple 
night sky. It was completely dark. Not a light on anywhere. 

“No one home,” Danny said, whispering. 

“Good,” Todd replied. “This is even better. Maybe we can look down in the 
basement window or find the window to Patrick’s room, and see what he’s 
working on.” 

“Maybe,” Danny replied reluctantly. 

Todd glanced around. Patrick’s house was the only one on the block. And it 
was surrounded by woods. 

Both boys climbed off their bikes and started to walk them to the driveway. 

“I can’t believe Patrick would live in such a wreck of a place,” Todd said, 
pulling off his cap and scratching his hair. “I mean, this house is a real dump.” 

“Maybe his parents are weird or something,” Danny suggested as they 
parked their bikes. 

“Maybe,” Todd replied thoughtfully. 

“Sometimes rich people get a little weird,” Danny said, climbing on to the 
porch and ringing the doorbell. 

“How would you know?” Todd said, snickering. He pulled his cap back 
down over his dark hair and rang the bell again. “No answer. Let’s check out the 
back,” he said, hopping off the porch. 

“What for?” Danny demanded. 

“Let’s just look in the windows,” Todd urged, moving along to the side of 
the house. “Let’s see if we can see anything at all.” 

As they turned the corner, it grew even darker. The pale sliver of moonlight 
was reflected in one of the upstairs windows. The only light. 

“This is dumb,” Danny complained. “It’s too dark to see anything inside the 



house. And, besides—” 

He stopped. 

“Now what’s wrong?” Todd demanded impatiently. 

“Didn’t you hear it? I heard it again,” Danny said. “Like a growl. Some 
kind of animal growl.” 

Todd didn’t hear the growl. 

But he saw something enormous running toward them. 

He saw the evil red glow of its eyes—unblinking eyes trained on him. 

And he knew it was too late to escape.

“Run!” Danny screamed. 

But Todd couldn’t move. 

As the enormous red-eyed monster bounded toward them, Todd pressed his 
back against a side door. 

He nearly fell as the door swung in. 

The creature uttered an ugly, threatening growl. Its huge paws thundered 
over the ground. 

“Inside!” Todd screamed. “Danny—get in the house!” 

His heart pounding as loudly as the monster’s paws, Todd scrambled into 
the dark house. Danny lurched in behind him, uttering low gasps. 

Todd slammed the door shut as the creature attacked. 

Its paws struck the windowpane in the door, making the entire door rattle. 

“It’s a dog!” Todd cried in a choked whisper. “A huge, angry dog!” 

The dog let out another ferocious growl and leaped at the door. Its paws 
scraped over the window. 

“A dog?” Danny exclaimed shrilly. “I thought it was a gorilla !” 

The two boys pressed their shoulders against the door, holding it shut. They 
peered out warily at the big creature. 

The dog had sat back on its haunches. It stared in at them, its red eyes 
glowing. It was panting loudly, its enormous tongue hanging out of its mouth. 

“Someone should put that guy on a diet!” Danny exclaimed. 

“We could ride that dog to school!” Todd added. 

“How do we get out of here?” Danny asked, turning away from the dog. His 
eyes searched the dark room. 

“He’ll go away,” Todd said. He swallowed hard. “Probably.” 

“This place is a dump,” Danny said, stepping into the room. 

Todd turned to follow Danny. They were in the kitchen, he saw. Pale 
moonlight floated in through the window. Even in this dim light, Todd could see 
that something was terribly wrong. 

The kitchen counters were bare and covered in dust. There were no 
appliances—no toaster, no microwave, no refrigerator. There were no dishes or 



pots and pans in view. Glancing down, Todd saw that the sink was caked with 
thick dirt. 

“Weird,” Danny muttered. 

The two boys made their way through a short hallway to the dining room. 

“Where’s the furniture?” Danny asked, gazing in all directions. 

The room was empty. 

“Maybe they’re redecorating or something,” Todd guessed. 

“This doesn’t make sense. Patrick’s family is rich,” Danny said, shaking his 
head. “You know how neat Patrick is. He gets upset if his shirt comes untucked.” 

“I don’t get it,” Todd replied. “Where do you think he has his worm 
project?” 

The two boys made their way toward the living room. Their sneakers 
scraped over the dusty, bare floor. 

“Something is weird here,” Danny murmured. “Something is very weird.” 

They both gasped as they stepped into the living room—and saw the figure 
hunched at the window. 

Saw the decayed green flesh of his face. 

Saw the bones of his jaw, open in a hideous toothless grin. 

Saw his evil, sunken eyes staring across the room at them.

The heavy silence was broken by the shrill screams of the two boys. 

“Go! Go!” Todd cried. He shoved Danny toward the door and stumbled 
along behind him, keeping his hands on Danny’s shoulders. 

“Go! Go! Go!” 

Through the bare dining room. Across the dust-covered kitchen. 

“Go! Go!” 

Todd grabbed the doorknob, pulled open the door, and they both burst out 
of the house. 

Had the dog left? 

Yes! 

“Let’s move/” Todd cried. 

But Danny needed no encouragement. He was already halfway down the 
driveway, his chubby legs pumping hard, his hands stretched out in front of him 
as if trying to pull himself to safety. 

Out the gate. Onto their bikes. 

They pedaled furiously. Faster. Faster. Until their legs ached and they could 
barely breathe. And they never looked back. 

Who was that hideous, decayed figure in Patrick’s house? 

And why was the house so dusty, so totally bare? 

Todd spent most of the night lying awake in his bed, thinking about it. 

But the mystery wasn’t cleared up until the next morning. 

Yawning sleepily, Todd pulled on the same clothes he had worn the day 
before. Then he made his way down the hall to go to breakfast. 

He stopped outside Regina’s bedroom door when he heard her laughing. At 
first, he thought she was talking to herself. 

But then he realized that Regina was on the phone. 

So early? 

He pressed his ear to the door and listened. 

“Isn’t it a riot, Beth?” Regina was saying. “I sent them to the wrong 
address.” Regina laughed again. Gleeful laughter. 



Todd suddenly snapped wide awake. He pressed his ear tighter against the 
bedroom door. 

“Todd was so desperate, I couldn’t resist,” Regina was saying. “Know 
where I sent them?” 

There was a short pause. Todd realized he was holding his breath. He let it 
out silently and took another one, listening hard. 

“I sent them to the old Fosgate mansion,” Regina told Beth. She laughed. 
“Yeah. Right. That old deserted mansion where those kids had that Halloween 
party. Yeah. You know. They left that dummy with the weird mask in the 
window.” 

Another pause. 

Todd gritted his teeth as he listened to his sister’s triumphant laughter. He 
could feel every muscle in his body tightening in anger. 

“I don’t know, Beth. I haven’t talked to him yet,” Regina was saying. “I 
heard Todd come in last night. He ran straight to his room and shut the door. He 
was probably too scared to talk!” 

More laughter. 

Balling and unballing his fists, Todd stepped away from his sister’s door. 
He stopped at the stairs, feeling his face grow red-hot. He was thinking hard. 

So Reggie played a little joke on Danny and me, he thought bitterly. So she 
gave me the wrong address and sent us to that old haunted house. 

Ha-ha. Good joke. 

Todd felt so angry, he wanted to scream. 

Now Regina will be laughing at me about this forever, he realized. She will 
make fun of me for the rest of my life. 

Her bedroom door opened, and Regina stepped out into the hall. She was 
pulling her brown hair back into a ponytail. 

She stopped when she saw Todd at the top of the stairs. “So, how did it go 
last night?” she asked him, grinning. 

“Fine,” he replied casually. He gave her an innocent, wide-eyed stare. 

Her grin faded. “Did you go to Patrick’s house? Did you talk to him about 
his worm project?” she demanded, staring back at him, studying his face. 

Todd shook his head. “No. Danny and I decided to skip it. We just hung out 
at Danny’s,” he lied. 

Her dark eyes seemed to dim. She bit her lower lip. Todd could see how 
disappointed she was. 



He turned and made his way down the stairs, feeling a little better. 
You want to play jokes, Reggie? he thought. 

Okay. Fine. 

But now it’s my turn. My turn to play a mean joke. 

Todd smiled. He had already thought of a really good one. 



10 


Todd hoisted the cardboard carton in both hands. His worm house was packed 
carefully inside. It was heavier than he thought. 

“Where shall I put it?” he asked Mrs. Sanger, struggling to keep the heavy 
carton from slipping out of his hands. 

“What? I can’t hear you!” The science teacher held a clipboard in one hand. 
She cupped her other hand around her mouth as a megaphone. 

It was deafening in the gym as the kids all hurried to set up their science 
projects in time for the expo. Excited voices competed with scraping chairs and 
tables, the rattle of cartons being unpacked, and projects of all shapes and sizes 
being assembled and set up. 

“What a crowd!” Todd exclaimed. 

“I can’t hear you!” Mrs. Sanger shouted. She pointed to a long table against 
the wall. “I think your project goes there, Todd.” 

Todd started to say something. But he was interrupted by the crash of 
shattering glass and a girl’s loud scream. 

“Was that the acid?” Mrs. Sanger shouted, her eyes going wide with horror. 
“Was that the acid?” She pushed past Todd and went tearing across the gym, 
holding her clipboard in front of her like a shield. 

Todd watched a lot of kids gathering around the spot of the accident. Mrs. 
Sanger burst into the circle, and everyone began talking at once. 

Around the vast gym, others ignored the excitement and continued 
feverishly setting up their projects. 

The bleachers had been pulled down. Some parents and other kids from the 
school were already seated, waiting to watch the expo and the judging of 
projects. 

Groaning, Todd started to make his way through the crowded gym carrying 
the carton. He had to stop and chuckle when he caught a glimpse of Regina and 
Beth. 

They had their enormous robin set up close to the bleachers. The head was 
the right size now. They had managed to shave it down smoothly. 

But some of the tail feathers had gotten mashed. And they were working 
frantically to smooth them out. 



What losers, Todd thought, grinning. 

There’s no way they’re going to win the computer. 

Turning away, he glimpsed Danny’s balloon solar system hanging on the 
back wall. One of the balloons—the one closest to the sun—had already 
deflated. 

Pitiful, Todd thought, shaking his head. That’s just pitiful. 

He sighed. Poor Danny. I guess I should have let him share in my project. 

Todd lowered the carton onto the table reserved for him. 

“Ten minutes, everyone! Ten minutes!” Mrs. Sanger was shouting. 

No problem, Todd thought. 

He opened the carton and carefully lifted out the worm house. What a 
beauty! he thought proudly. 

It looked like a perfect little house. Todd had polished the wood frame until 
it glowed. And he had cleaned the glass until it was spotless. 

He set the worm house down carefully on the table and turned it so that the 
glass side faced the audience in the bleachers. He gazed into it. He could see the 
long, brown and purple worms crawling from room to room. 

He had packed the dirt in carefully. Then he had dropped in more than 
twenty worms before sealing it all up. 

It’s a real big family! he thought, grinning. 

Once the worm house was in place, Todd pulled out the sign he had made 
for it and placed the sign beside it on the table. 

He stepped back to admire his work. But someone pushed him gently aside. 

“Make room. Make room, Todd.” It was Mrs. Sanger. And to Todd’s 
surprise, she was helping Patrick MacKay carry a long cardboard carton to the 
table. 

“Move your project to the side, Todd,” the teacher instructed. “You have to 
share the table.” 

“Huh? Share?” Todd hesitated. 

“Hurry—please!” Mrs. Sanger pleaded. “Patrick’s box is heavy.” 

“I’m sharing the table with Patrick?” Todd couldn’t hide his unhappiness. 

Obediently, he slid his worm house to one side of the table. Then he stood 
behind the table, watching as Patrick and the teacher unloaded the long carton. 
The box was nearly six feet long. 

“Is that all one worm?” Todd joked. 

“Very funny,” Patrick muttered. He was straining hard to lift his project 



onto the table. 

“This will be our worm table,” Mrs. Sanger said, grabbing the end of the 
carton and tugging. Patrick pulled, too. 

Todd gasped as Patrick hoisted his project onto the tabletop. 

“Very impressive, Patrick,” Mrs. Sanger commented, straightening her 
skirt. She hurried off to help someone else. 

Todd gaped at the project. It towered over his. It was nearly six feet tall, 
taller than Patrick! 

“Oh, nooooo,” Todd moaned to himself. He turned to Patrick. “It—it 
isn’t... it can’t be—!” He choked on the words. 

Patrick was busily setting up his sign. He stepped back, checking it out, 
making sure it was straight. 

“Yes, it is!” he said, beaming at Todd. “It’s a worm skyscraper!” 

“Wow.” Todd didn’t want to show how upset he was. But he couldn’t help 
it. His legs were trembling. His mouth dropped open. And he started to stutter, 
“But—but—but—” 

I don’t believe this! Todd thought miserably. 

I built a crummy little worm house. And Patrick made a skyscraper! 

It’s not fair! Not fair! 

Patrick doesn’t even like worms! 

He stared at the giant wood-and-glass structure. He could see dozens and 
dozens of worms inside. They were crawling from floor to floor. There was even 
a wooden elevator with several worms tucked inside. 

“Todd—are you okay?” Patrick asked. 

“Yeah. Uh... fine,” Todd replied, trying to force his legs to stop quivering. 

“You look a little weird,” Patrick said, staring at Todd with his bright blue 

eyes. 

“Uh... that’s a nice project, Patrick,” Todd admitted through clenched teeth. 
“You could win the big prize.” 

“You think so?” Patrick replied, as if the thought had never occurred to him. 
“Thanks, Todd. I got the idea from you. About worms, I mean.” 

You stole the idea, you thief! Todd thought angrily. 

I have only one wish for you, Patrick. Go eat worms! 

“Wow! What’s that?” Danny’s voice broke into Todd’s ugly thoughts. He 
was staring in amazement at Patrick’s project. 

“It’s a worm skyscraper,” Patrick told him, beaming with pride. 



Danny admired it for a while. Then he turned to Todd. “Why didn’t you 
think of that?” he whispered. 

Todd gave Danny a hard shove. “Go blow up a balloon,” he muttered. 

Danny spun around angrily. “Don’t shove me—” 

Mrs. Sanger’s voice over the loudspeaker rose over the noise of the gym. 
“Places by your projects, everyone. The expo is starting. The judges will begin 
their rounds.” 

Danny hurried back to his balloon solar system against the wall. Todd 
watched him make his way past a display of rocks. Danny was swinging his 
arms as he walked, and he nearly knocked over all the rocks. 

Then Todd stepped behind the table. He brushed a speck of dust off the roof 
of his worm house. 

I should just toss it in the trash, he thought miserably. He glanced at Patrick, 
who stood beside him, grinning from ear to ear, his hands resting on the sides of 
his magnificent skyscraper. 

The copycat is going to win, Todd thought sadly. 

He sighed. Only one thing would cheer him up a little. One thing. And 
gazing across the gym, Todd saw that it was time for it to happen. 

The three judges—all teachers from another school—were stepping up to 
check out Christopher Robin. As they bent low to examine the papier-mache bird 
feet, Todd made his way quickly over to his sister’s project. 

He wanted a good view. 

One judge, a plump young woman in a bright yellow vest, examined the tail 
feathers. Another judge, a man with a shiny bald head, was questioning Regina 
and Beth. The third judge had her back to Todd. She was running her hand over 
the bird’s swelling orange breast. 

Reggie and Beth look really nervous, Todd thought, edging past a display 
on how trash gets recycled. 

Well, they should be nervous. What a dumb project. 

Todd stopped a few feet in front of the bleachers. There was a really big 
audience for the expo, he noticed. The bleachers were at least two-thirds filled. 
Mostly parents and younger brothers and sisters of the contestants. 

The bald judge kept making notes on a small pad as he questioned Regina 
and Beth. The other two judges were staring up at the giant robin’s beak. 

Todd edged closer. 

“What’s this string?” the judge in the yellow vest asked Beth. 



“Huh? String?” Beth reacted with surprise. She and Regina raised their eyes 
to the yellow beak. 

“What string?” Regina demanded. 

Too late. 

The judge in the yellow vest pulled the string. 

The beak lowered, revealing a surprise inside. 

“Ohhhh.” 

“Yuck!” 

Disgusted groans rose up from the audience. 

And Regina and Beth started to scream. 



11 


Fat worms wriggled out from inside the bird’s beak. 

Some of them wriggled out and rained down on the judges. 

A huge purple worm plopped onto the bald judge’s head. The angry judge’s 
red face darkened until it nearly matched the purple worm. 

Early that morning, Todd had packed about thirty worms in there. He was 
glad to see that most of them had stayed in the beak. 

People in the bleachers were groaning and moaning. “That’s sick!” 
someone yelled. 

“Gross! That’s so gross!” a little boy kept repeating. 

The judges were demanding to know if Regina and Beth had stuffed the 
worms up there as a joke. 

Mrs. Sanger was glaring angrily at them. The two girls were sputtering their 
apologies. 

It was a thrilling moment, Todd thought. A thrilling moment. 

About ten or fifteen worms were wriggling across the gym floor. Todd 
started to edge back to his table. 

“There he is! My brother!” he heard Regina shout. He glanced up to see her 
pointing furiously at him. “Todd did it! It had to be Todd!” 

He gave her an innocent shrug. “I thought Christopher Robin looked hungry 
—so I fed him!” he called. Then he hurried back to his worm house. 

A big grin on his handsome face, Patrick slapped Todd a high five. “Cool 
move, ace!” 

Todd grudgingly accepted the congratulations. He didn’t want to be friends 
with Patrick. He wanted Patrick to go eat worms. 

He glanced back at Danny. Danny was frantically blowing up a balloon. 
The rings had fallen off Saturn. And someone had accidentally popped Pluto. 

Todd smiled. He felt pretty good. His little joke had worked perfectly. 
Revenge was sweet. He had paid Regina back for sending him to that creepy old 
house. 

But his smile faded as he glanced at Patrick’s skyscraper and remembered 
that he was going to miss out on the grand prize. 

It took the school janitor a few minutes to round up all the worms. The 



crowd in the bleachers cheered him on as he scooped up the wiggling worms one 
by one and dropped them into an empty coffee can. 

After that, the expo continued calmly and quietly. The judges moved from 
project to project, asking questions, making notes. 

Todd took a deep breath when they approached his table. Don’t get excited, 
he warned himself. The worm house looks really puny next to the worm 
skyscraper. 

He had a sudden urge to bump the table, to shake it really hard. Maybe the 
skyscraper would topple over, and the house would be left standing. 

I could pretend it was just an accident, Todd thought. 

Evil thoughts. 

But he didn’t do it. 

The three judges spent about ten seconds looking at Todd’s project. They 
didn’t ask Todd a single question. 

Then they gazed at Patrick’s skyscraper for at least five minutes. “How did 
you get all those worms in there?” the bald judge asked. 

“I love the elevator!” 

“How many worms are there in total?” 

“Can worms survive in a real skyscraper?” 

“And what does this project prove about gravity?” 

Yak yak yak, Todd thought bitterly. 

He watched the judges coo and carry on over Patrick’s project. He wanted 
to grab all three of them and say, “He’s a copycat! I’m the real worm guy! I’m 
the one who likes worms!” 

But he just stood there grinding his teeth, tapping his fingers tensely on the 
tabletop. 

Still scribbling notes about Patrick’s project, the judges moved on to the 
next project—Liquids and Gases. 

Patrick turned to Todd and forced him into slapping another high five. “You 
can come over and see my new computer anytime,” Patrick whispered 
confidently. 

Todd forced a weak laugh. He turned away from Patrick—and found his 
sister glaring at him furiously from the other side of the table. 

“How could you, Todd!” she demanded, spitting out the words, her hands 
pressed tightly at her waist. “How could you do that to Beth and me?” 

“Easy,” he replied, unable to keep a grin off his face. 



“You ruined our project!” Regina cried. 

“I know,” Todd said, still grinning. “You deserved it.” 

Regina started to sputter. 

The loudspeaker above their heads crackled on. “Ladies and gentlemen, we 
have a winner!” Mrs. Sanger declared. 

The huge gym grew silent. No one moved. 

“The judges have a winner!” Mrs. Sanger repeated, her voice booming off 
the tile walls. “The grand-prize winner of this year’s Science Expo is...” 



12 


“The winner is...” Mrs. Sanger announced, “Danny Fletcher and his Balloon 
Solar System!” 

The audience in the bleachers was quiet for a moment, but then erupted in 
cheers and applause. Todd’s classmates on the floor applauded, too. 

Todd turned and caught the startled expression on Danny’s face. Several 
kids rushed forward to congratulate Danny. The balloons bobbed behind Danny 
as he grinned and took a funny bow. 

The gym erupted as everyone began to talk at once. Then the spectators 
made their way down from the bleachers and began wandering through the 
displays. 

I don’t believe this! Todd thought. Glancing at Patrick, he saw that Patrick 
felt the same way. 

Danny flashed Todd a thumbs-up sign. Todd returned it, shaking his head. 

He felt a hard shove on his shoulders. 

“Hey—” he cried out angrily and spun around. “Are you still here?” 

Regina glared at him angrily. “That’s for ruining our project!” she shouted. 

She shoved him again. “You apologize! ” she demanded furiously. 

He laughed. “No way!” 

She growled at him and raised her fists. “Go eat worms!” she screamed. 

Still laughing, he pulled off the wooden back of his worm house and lifted 
up a long, brown worm. He dangled it in front of his sister’s face. “Here. Have 
some dessert.” 

With a furious cry, Regina completely lost all control. 

She leaped at Todd, shoving him over backwards. 

He cried out as he sprawled back—and hit the table hard. 

Several kids let out startled screams as the enormous worm skyscraper 
tilted ... tilted... tilted.... 

“No!” Patrick screamed. He reached out both hands to stop it. 

And missed. 

And the heavy wood-and-glass structure toppled onto the next table with a 
deafening crash of shattered glass. 



“No!” a girl screamed. “That’s Liquids and Gases! Look out—it’s Liquids 
and Gases!” 

Dirt poured out of the broken skyscraper. Several worms came wriggling 
out onto the table. 

As Todd pulled himself to his feet, wild screams filled the gym. 

“Liquids and Gases!” 

“What’s that smoke?” 

“What did they break? Did they break a window?” 

“Liquids and Gases!” 

Thick, white smoke poured up from a broken glass bottle under the fallen 
skyscraper. 

“Everybody out!” someone yelled. “Everybody out! It’s going to blow up!” 



13 


No one was hurt in the explosion. 

Some strange gases escaped, and it smelled pretty weird in the gym for a 
while. 

A lot of worms went flying across the room. And there was a lot of broken 
glass to be cleaned up. 

But it was a minor explosion, Todd told his parents later. “Really. No big 
deal,” he said. “I’m sure everyone will forget all about it in five or ten years.” 

A few days later, carrying a small, white carton in both hands, Todd made his 
way down the basement stairs. He could hear the steady plonk plonk of Ping- 
Pong balls against paddles. 

Regina and Beth glanced up from their game as he entered the room. 
“Chinese food?” Beth asked, spotting the little box. 

“No. Worms,” Todd replied, crossing the room to his worm tank. 

“Are you still into worms?” Beth demanded, twirling her Ping-Pong paddle. 
“Even after what happened at the Science Expo?” 

“It all got cleaned up,” Todd snapped. “It was no big deal.” 

“Hah!” Regina cried scornfully. 

Todd gazed at his sister in surprise. “Hey, are you talking to me again?” 
Regina was so furious, she hadn’t said a word to him since the big disaster. 

“No. I am not talking to you,” Regina replied with a sneer. “I will never talk 
to you again.” 

“Give me a break!” Todd muttered. He opened the carton and poured the 
new worms into the big glass aquarium where he stored his collection. 

Plonk. Plonk. The girls returned to their game. 

“You know, what happened at the Science Expo was no tragedy,” Todd 
called to them. “Some people thought it was kind of funny.” He snickered. 

“Some people are kind of sick,” Beth muttered. 

Regina slammed the ball hard. It sailed into the net. “You ruined 
everything,” she accused Todd angrily. “You ruined the whole expo.” 

“And you ruined our project,” Beth added, reaching for the ball. “You made 
us look like total jerks.” 



“So?” Todd replied, laughing. 

The girls didn’t laugh. 

“I only did it because you sent Danny and me to that creepy old house,” 
Todd told them. He used a small trowel to soften the dirt in the worm tank. 

“Well, you wouldn’t have won, anyway,” Regina said, sneering. “Patrick’s 
skyscraper made your puny house look like a baby’s project.” 

“You’re jealous of Patrick—aren’t you, Todd!” Beth accused him. 

“Jealous of that copycat?” Todd cried. “He doesn’t know one end of a 
worm from another!” 

The girls started their game again. Beth took a wild swing and sent the ball 
sailing across the room. 

Todd caught it with his free hand. “Come here,” he said. “I’ll show you 
something cool.” 

“No way,” Regina replied nastily. 

“Just toss back the ball,” Beth said, holding up her hand to catch it. 

“Come here. This is really cool,” Todd insisted, grinning. 

He pulled a long worm out of the tank and held it up in the air. It wriggled 
and squirmed, trying to get free. 

Regina and Beth didn’t move away from the table. But he saw that they 
were watching him. 

Todd set the long worm down on the table and picked up a pocket knife. 
“You watching?” With one quick motion, he sliced the worm in half. 

“Yuck!” Beth cried, making a disgusted face. 

“You’re sick!” Regina declared. “You’re really sick, Todd.” 

“Watch!” Todd instmcted. 

All three of them stared at the tabletop as the two worm halves wriggled off 
in different directions. 

“See?” Todd cried, laughing. “Now there are two of them!” 

“Sick. Really sick,” his sister muttered. 

“That’s really gross, Todd,” Beth agreed, shaking her head. 

“But wouldn’t it be cool if people could do that?” Todd exclaimed. “You 
know. Your bottom half goes to school, and your top half stays home and 
watches TV!” 

“Hey! Look at that!” Regina cried suddenly. She pointed to the glass worm 

tank. 

“Huh? What?” Todd demanded, lowering his eyes to the worms. 



“Those worms—they were watching you!” Regina exclaimed. “See? 
They’re sort of staring at you.” 

“Get serious,” Todd muttered. But he saw that Regina was right. Three of 
the worms had their heads raised out of the dirt and seemed to be staring up at 
him. “You have a weird imagination,” Todd insisted. 

“No. They were watching,” Regina insisted excitedly. “I saw them watching 
you when you cut that worm in two.” 

“Worms can’t see!” Todd told them. “They weren’t watching me. That’s 
stupid! That’s—” 

“But they were!” Regina cried. 

“The worms are angry,” Beth added, glancing at Regina. “The worms don’t 
like to see their friend cut in half.” 

“Stop,” Todd pleaded. “Just give me a break, okay?” 

“The worms are going to get revenge, Todd,” Regina said. “They saw what 
you did. Now they’re planning their revenge.” 

Todd let out a scornful laugh. “You must think I’m as stupid as you are!” he 
declared. “There’s no way I’m going to fall for that. No way I’m going to 
believe such a stupid idea.” 

Giggling to each other, Regina and Beth returned to their Ping-Pong game. 

Todd dropped the two worm halves into the tank. To his surprise, four more 
worms had poked up out of the soft dirt. They were staring straight up at him. 

Todd stared down at them, thinking about what Regina and Beth had said. 

What a stupid idea, he thought. Those worms weren’t watching me. 

Or were they? 



14 


“Todd—rise and shine!” 

Todd blinked his eyes open. He sat up slowly in bed and stretched his arms 
over his head. 

“Rise and shine, Todd! Look alive!” his mother called from the foot of the 
stairs. 

Why does she say the same thing every morning? he wondered. Always 
“Rise and shine, rise and shine!” Why can’t she say, “Time to get up!” or, “Move 
’em on out!” or something? Just for a little variety. 

Grumpily, he pulled himself up and lowered his feet to the floor. 

Why can’t I have a clock radio like Regina? he asked himself. Then I could 
wake up to music instead of “Rise and shine!” 

“Look alive up there!” Mrs. Barstow called impatiently. 

“I’m up! I’m up, Mom!” Todd shouted hoarsely down to her. 

Bright sunlight poured in through the bedroom window. Squinting toward 
the window, he could see a patch of clear blue sky. 

Nice day, he thought. 

What day is it? he asked himself, standing up and stretching some more. 
Thursday? Yeah. Thursday. 

Good, he thought. We have gym on Thursday. Maybe we’ll play softball. 

Gym was Todd’s favorite class—especially on days they went outside. 

His pajama bottoms had become totally twisted. He straightened them as he 
made his way to the bathroom to brush his teeth. 

Are we having the math quiz today or tomorrow? he wondered, squinting at 
his sleepy face in the medicine chest mirror. I hope it’s tomorrow. I forgot to 
study for it last night. 

He stuck his tongue out at himself. 

He could hear Regina downstairs, arguing about something with their 
mother. Regina liked to argue in the morning. It was the way she got her mind 
into gear. 

She argued about what to wear. Or what she wanted for breakfast. One of 
her favorite arguments was whether or not it was too warm to wear a jacket. 

Todd’s mother never learned. She always argued back. So they had pretty 



noisy mornings. 

Todd liked to sleep as long as possible. Then he took his time getting 
dressed. That way, Regina was usually all finished with her arguing by the time 
he came downstairs. 

Thinking about the math quiz, he brushed his teeth. Then he returned to his 
room and pulled on a clean pair of faded jeans and a navy blue T-shirt that came 
down nearly to his knees. 

Regina and Mrs. Barstow were still arguing as Todd entered the kitchen. 
Regina, her dark hair tied back in a single braid, sat at the table, finishing her 
breakfast. Their mother, dressed for work, stood on the other side of the table, a 
steaming cup of coffee in one hand. 

“But I’m too hot in that jacket!” Regina was insisting. 

“Then why not wear a sweatshirt?” their mother suggested patiently. 

“I don’t have any,” Regina complained. 

“You have a whole drawerful!” Mrs. Barstow protested. 

“But I don’t like those!” Regina cried shrilly. 

Todd grabbed his glass of orange juice off the table and gulped it down in 
one long swallow. 

“Todd, sit down and have your breakfast,” his mother ordered. 

“Can’t. I’m late,” he said, wiping orange juice off his upper lip with one 
hand. “Got to go.” 

“But you haven’t brushed your hair!” Mrs. Barstow exclaimed. 

Regina, chewing on a piece of rye toast, laughed. “How can you tell?” 

Todd ignored her. “No need,” he told his mother. “I’m wearing my Raiders 
cap.” He glanced toward the hook on the hallway wall where he thought he had 
left it. Not there. 

“I can’t believe the school lets you wear your cap all day,” Mrs. Barstow 
murmured, refilling her coffee cup. 

“They don’t care,” Todd told her. 

“Only the real grunges wear caps,” Regina reported. 

“Is your brother a grunge?” their mother asked, raising her eyes over the 
white mug as she sipped coffee. 

“Has anyone seen my Raiders cap?” Todd asked quickly, before Regina 
could answer. 

“Isn’t it on the hook?” Mrs. Barstow asked, glancing toward the hall. 

Todd shook his head. “Maybe I left it upstairs.” He turned and hurried 



toward the front stairs. 

“Come back and eat your cereal! It’s getting soggy!” his mother called. 
Grabbing on to the banister, Todd took the stairs two at a time. Standing in 
the doorway to his room, his eyes searched the bed. The dressertop. 

No cap. 

He was halfway to the closet when he spotted it on the floor. I must have 
tossed it there before bed, he remembered. 

Bending down, he picked up the cap and slid it down over his hair. 

He knew at once that something was wrong. 

Something felt funny. 

As he bent the bill down the way he liked it, he felt something move in his 

hair. 

Something wet. 

It felt as if his hair had come to life and had started to crawl around under 
the cap. 

Moving quickly to the mirror over the dresser, Todd pulled the cap away— 
and stared in shock at the fat, brown worms wriggling through his hair.

Todd shook his head hard. A shudder of surprise. 

One of the worms toppled from his hair and slid down his forehead, 
dropping onto the dressertop. 

“I don’t believe this,” Todd muttered out loud. 

He tossed the cap to the floor. Then he reached up with both hands and 
carefully began untangling the worms from his hair. 

“Regina!” he screamed. “Regina—you’re going to pay for this!” 

He pulled three worms off his head, then picked up the fourth from the 
dresser. “Yuck.” He made a disgusted face into the mirror. His hair was damp 
and sticky where the worms had crawled. 

“Okay, Reggie! I’m coming!” he shouted as he barreled down the stairs, the 
worms dangling in one fist. 

She glanced up casually from the table as Todd burst into the kitchen. 

“Your cereal is really getting soggy,” his mother said from the sink. “You’d 
better—” She stopped when she saw the worms in Todd’s hand. 

“Very funny, Regina!” Todd exclaimed angrily. He shoved the fistful of 
worms under his sister’s nose. 

“Yuck! Get away!” she shrieked. 

“Todd—get those worms away from the table!” Mrs. Barstow demanded 
sharply. “What’s wrong with you? You know better than that!” 

“Don’t yell at me!” Todd screeched at his mother. “Yell at her!” He pointed 
furiously at his sister. 

“Me?” Regina’s eyes opened wide in innocence. “What did I do?” 

Todd let out an angry groan and turned to face his mother. “She stuffed 
worms in my cap!” he exclaimed, shaking the worms in Mrs. Barstow’s face. 

“Huh?” Regina cried furiously. “That’s a he!” 

Todd and Regina began screaming accusations at each other. 

Mrs. Barstow stepped between them. “Quiet—please!” she demanded. 
“Please!” 

“But—but—!” Todd sputtered. 

“Todd, you’re going to squeeze those poor worms to death!” Mrs. Barstow 
declared. “Go put them away in the basement. Then take a deep breath, count to 



ten, and come back.” 

Todd grumbled under his breath. But he obediently headed down to the 
basement. 

When he returned to the kitchen a minute later, Regina was still denying 
that she had loaded the cap with worms. She turned to Todd, a solemn 
expression on her face. “I swear, Todd,” she said, “it wasn’t me.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Todd muttered. “Then who else did it? Dad? Do you think 
Dad filled my cap with worms before he went to work?” 

The idea was so ridiculous, it made all three of them laugh. 

Mrs. Barstow put her hands on Todd’s shoulders and guided him into his 
seat at the table. “Cereal,” she said softly. “Eat your cereal. You’re going to be 
late.” 

“Leave my worms alone,” Todd told his sister in a low voice. He pulled the 
chair in and picked up the spoon. “I mean it, Reggie. I hate your stupid jokes. 
And I don’t like people messing with my worms.” 

Regina sighed wearily. “I don’t mess with your disgusting worms,” she shot 
back. “I told you—I didn’t do it.” 

“Let’s just drop it, okay?” Mrs. Barstow pleaded. “Look at the clock, guys.” 

“But why should she get away with that, Mom?” Todd demanded. “Why 
should she be allowed to—” 

“Because I didn’t do it!” Regina interrupted. 

“You had to do it!” Todd screamed. 

“I think you did it yourself,” Regina suggested with a sneer. “I think you 
stuffed worms in your own cap.” 

“Oh, that’s good! That’s good!” Todd cried sarcastically. “Why, Regina? 
Why would I do that?” 

“To get me in trouble,” Regina replied. 

Todd gaped at her, speechless. 

“You’re both going to be in trouble if you don’t drop this discussion—right 
now,” their mother insisted. 

“Okay. We’ll drop it,” Todd grumbled, glaring at his sister. 

He dipped the spoon into the cereal. “Totally soggy,” he muttered. “How 
am I supposed to—” 

Regina’s shrill scream cut off Todd’s complaint. 

He followed her horrified gaze down to his bowl—where he found a fat 
purple worm floating on top of the milk. 



16 


Todd tried to concentrate in school, but he kept thinking about the worms. 

Of course it had to be Regina who had put the worms in his cap and in his 
cereal bowl. 

But she had acted so shocked. And she said again and again that she didn’t 
know anything about them. 

Todd kept thinking about the afternoon in the basement. About cutting the 
worm in half. About the other worms watching him from their glass tank. 

“They saw what you did,” his sister had said in a low, frightened voice. 
“And now they’re planning their revenge.” 

That’s so stupid, Todd thought, pretending to read his social studies text. 

So stupid. 

But thinking about Regina’s words gave him a chill. 

And thinking about the worms waiting in his cap, crawling so wetly 
through his hair, made Todd feel a little sick. 

He told Danny all about it at lunch. 

They sat across from each other in the noisy lunchroom. Danny unpacked 
his lunch from the brown paper lunch bag and examined the sandwich. “Ham 
and cheese again,” he groaned. “Every day Mom gives me ham and cheese.” 

“Why don’t you ask for something else?” Todd suggested. 

“I don’t like anything else,” Danny replied, tearing open his bag of potato 
chips. 

Todd unpacked his lunch, too. But he left it untouched as he told Danny 
about the worms. 

Danny laughed at first. “Your sister is really a jerk,” he said through a 
mouthful of potato chips. 

“I guess you’re right,” Todd replied thoughtfully. “It’s got to be Regina. But 
she acted so surprised. I mean, she screamed when she saw the worm floating in 
the cereal.” 

“She probably practiced screaming all day yesterday,” Danny said, 
chomping into his sandwich. 

Todd unwrapped the tinfoil from his sandwich. Peanut butter and jelly. 
“Yeah. Maybe,” he said, frowning. 



“Come on, Todd,” Danny said, mustard dripping down his chin. “That 
worm tank of yours is really deep. The worms didn’t crawl out all by 
themselves. And they didn’t crawl upstairs to your room and then find your hat 
and crawl inside.” 

“You’re right. You’re right,” Todd said, still frowning thoughtfully. He 
pushed back his Raiders cap and scratched his brown hair. “But I just keep 
seeing those worms staring up at me, and—” 

“Worms don’t have eyes!” Danny declared. “And they don’t have faces. 
And, mainly, they don’t have brains!” 

Todd laughed. Danny was completely right, he realized. 

The idea of worms planning to get their revenge was just dumb. 

Feeling a lot better, he slid down in the chair and started his lunch. “Let’s 
talk about something else,” he said, taking a long drink from his box of juice. He 
raised his peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich to his mouth and took a big bite. 

“Did you see Dawkins fall off his chair this morning?” Danny asked, 
snickering. 

Todd grinned. “Yeah. Miss Grant jumped so high, her head nearly hit the 
ceiling! I thought she was going to drop her teeth!” 

“Luckily Dawkins landed on his head!” Danny exclaimed, wiping the 
mustard off his chin with the back of one hand. “Dawkins can’t stay on a chair. 
No balance, or something. Every day he—” 

Danny stopped when he saw the sick expression on Todd’s face. “Hey, 
Todd—what’s your problem?” 

“Th-this peanut butter sandwich,” Todd stammered. “It... tastes kind of 
strange.” 

“Huh?” Danny lowered his eyes to the half-eaten sandwich in Todd’s hand. 

Reluctantly, Todd pulled apart the two slices of bread. 

Both boys moaned in disgust and let out hoarse gagging sounds as they saw 
the half-eaten purple worm curled up in the peanut butter. 



17 


“Have you seen my sister?” Todd asked a group of kids at the door that led out to 
the playground. 

They all shook their heads no. 

After angrily tossing away his lunch, Todd had run out of the lunchroom in 
search of Regina. He had to let her know that her dumb joke had gone too far. 

Putting a worm in his peanut butter wasn’t the least bit funny. It was sick. 

As he ran through the halls, searching in each room for her, Todd could still 
taste the faintly sour flavor of the worm, could still feel its soft squishy body 
between his teeth. 

It made his teeth itch. It made him feel itchy all over. 

Regina, you’re not getting away with this! he thought bitterly. 

By the time he reached the end of the hallway, he felt so angry, he was 
seeing red. 

He pushed past the group of kids, opened the door, and burst outside. The 
bright afternoon sunlight made him lower his cap to shield his eyes. 

He searched the playground for his sister. 

Some kids from his class were playing a loud, frantic kickball game on the 
Softball diamond. Jerry Dawkins and a few other guys called to Todd to join the 
game. 

But he waved them off and kept running. He was in no mood for games. 

Regina—where are you? 

He circled the entire playground and teacher parking lot before he gave up. 
Then he slowly, unhappily trudged back toward the school building. 

His stomach growled and churned. 

He could picture the worm half wriggling around inside him. 

All around, kids were yelling and laughing and having fun. 

They didn’t eat worms for lunch, Todd thought bitterly. They don’t have a 
mean, vicious sister who tries to ruin their lives. 

He was nearly to the door, walking slowly, his head bowed, when he 
spotted Regina standing in the shade at the corner of the building. 

He stopped and watched her. She was talking to someone. Then she started 
to laugh. 



Keeping against the redbrick wall, Todd edged a little closer. He could see 
two others in the shade with Regina. 

Beth and Patrick. 

All three of them were laughing now. 

What was so funny? 

Todd could feel the rage boiling up in him. As he crept closer, trying to hear 
what they were saying, he balled his hands into tight, angry fists. 

Pressing against the building, Todd stopped and listened. 

Regina said something. He couldn’t make out the words. 

He took a step closer. Then one more. 

And he heard Beth laugh and say, “So Todd doesn’t know you’re doing it?” 

And then Patrick replied, “No. Todd doesn’t know. He doesn’t know I’m 
doing it.” 



18 


Stunned, Todd jammed his back against the brick wall. 

Patrick? 

How can Patrick be doing it? Todd wondered. 

That’s impossible! Unless... 

Todd couldn’t hold back any longer. He angrily stepped forward, feeling his 
face grow red-hot. 

The three of them turned in surprise. 

“So you’re doing it?” Todd cried to Patrick. “You’re giving my sister the 
worms?” 

“Huh? Worms?” Patrick’s mouth dropped open. He held a large sheet of 
construction paper in his hand. Todd saw him slip the sheet of paper behind his 
back. 

“Yeah. Worms,” Todd repeated, snarling the words. “I heard what you said, 
Patrick.” 

“Patrick isn’t giving me worms,” Regina broke in. “What is your problem, 
Todd? Why would I want worms?” 

“That’s where you’re getting them!” Todd insisted. “I heard you! I heard the 
whole thing!” 

The three of them exchanged bewildered glances. 

“I’m not into worms anymore,” Patrick said. “I tossed all my worms into 
my dad’s garden.” 

“Liar,” Todd accused in a low voice. 

“No. It’s true. I helped him,” Beth said. 

“I got bored with them. I don’t collect them anymore,” Patrick told him. 
“I’m into comic strips now.” 

“Huh? Comic strips?” Todd stared suspiciously at Patrick. 

The two girls began to grin. 

“Yeah. I’m drawing comic strips,” Patrick said. “I’m a pretty good artist.” 

He’s just trying to confuse me, Todd thought angrily. 

“Patrick—give me a break,” Todd muttered. “You’re a really bad liar. I 
heard what you were saying, and—” 



With a quick move, Todd reached out and grabbed the sheet of paper from 
behind Patrick’s back. 

“Hey—give that back!” Patrick reached for it. But Todd swung it out of his 
reach. 

“Huh? It’s a comic strip!” Todd exclaimed. He raised it closer to his face 
and started to read it. 

THE ADVENTURES OF TODD THE WORM 

That was the title in big, block, super-hero-type letters. 

And in the first panel, there stood a smiling worm. With wavy brown hair. 
Wearing a silver-and-black Raiders cap. 

“Todd the Worm?” Todd cried weakly, staring at the comic strip in 
disbelief. 

The three of them burst out laughing. 

“That’s what we were laughing about,” Regina told him, shaking her head. 
“Patrick can draw pretty well—can’t he?” 

Todd didn’t reply. He scowled at the comic strip. 

Todd the Worm. A worm in a Raiders cap. 

Patrick thinks he’s so funny, Todd thought bitterly. “Ha-ha. Remind me to 
laugh sometime,” he murmured sarcastically. He handed the sheet of paper back 
to Patrick. 

The bell on the side of the building rang loudly above their heads. Todd 
covered his ears. Everyone on the playground started running to the door. 

Beth and Regina jogged ahead of Todd. 

“So what about the worm in my sandwich?” he called to his sister, hurrying 
to catch up. He grabbed her by the shoulder and spun her around. “What about 
the worm?” 

“Todd—let go!” She spun out of his grasp. “What worm? Are you still 
carrying on about breakfast?” 

“No. Lunch,” Todd shouted furiously. “You know what I’m talking about, 
Reggie. Don’t pretend.” 

She shook her head. “No, I really don’t, Todd.” She turned to the door. 
“We’re going to be late.” 

“You put the worm in my sandwich!” he screamed, his eyes locked on hers. 

She made a disgusted face. “Yuck! In your sandwich?” She seemed really 



shocked. “That’s gross!” 

“Regina—” 

“You didn’t eat it, did you?” she asked, covering her mouth in horror. 

“Uh... no. No way!” Todd lied. 

“Ugh! I’m going to be sick!” Regina cried. She turned and, still covering 
her mouth, ran into the building. 

Todd stared after her. She seemed totally shocked, he realized. 

Is it possible that Regina didn’t do it? 

Is it possible? 

But then, if Regina didn’t do it —what does that mean ? 



19 


“Aren’t you sick of worms? Why are we digging up more worms?” Danny 
demanded. 

Todd dug his shovel into the soft mud behind second base. “I need more,” 
he murmured. He pulled up a long, brown one. It wriggled between his fingers. 
“Move the bucket over, Danny.” 

Danny obediently held the bucket closer. Todd dropped the worm into it and 
bent to dig up more. “My worms are all disappearing,” he said softly, 
concentrating on his work. “They’re escaping, I guess. So I need more.” 

“But they can’t escape,” Danny insisted. 

Todd dropped a short, fat one into the bucket. 

They both heard the rumbling sound at the same time. 

The ground behind second base trembled. 

Danny’s eyes grew wide with fright. “Todd—another earthquake?” 

Todd tilted his head as he listened. He dropped the shovel and placed both 
hands flat on the ground. “It—it’s shaking a little,” he reported. 

“We’ve got to go!” Danny cried, climbing to his feet. “We’ve got to tell 
someone.” 

“Nobody ever believes us,” Todd replied, not moving from the ground. 
“And, look—the rest of the playground doesn’t seem to be shaking at all.” 

The mud made a soft cracking sound as it trembled. 

Todd jumped to his feet and grabbed up the bucket. 

“Maybe we should find another place to get worms,” Danny suggested, 
backing away from the spot, his eyes on the shaking ground. 

“But this is the best spot!” Todd replied. 

“Maybe it’s a sinkhole!” Danny declared as they hurried off the playground. 
“Did you see that sinkhole on the news? A big hole just opened up in 
somebody’s back yard. And it grew bigger and bigger, and people fell in it and 
were swallowed up.” 

“Stop trying to scare me,” Todd told his friend. “I’ve got enough problems 
without worrying about sinkholes!” 


When he arrived at school on Friday morning, Todd found three worms 



wriggling around in his backpack. He calmly carried them out to the front of the 
school and deposited them in the dirt under the long hedge that lined the 
building. 

I’m going to stay calm, he decided. 

They’re only worms, after all. And I like worms. I collect worms. I’m a 
worm expert. 

He returned to the building, frowning fretfully. 

If I’m such an expert, he asked himself, why can’t I explain how the worms 
are following me everywhere? 

When he took out his math notebook an hour later, he found a mass of long 
purple worms crawling around near the binding and between the pages. 

The kids sitting near him saw them and started pointing and screaming. 

“Todd,” Mr. Hargrove, the math teacher, said sternly, “I think we saw 
enough of your worms at the Science Expo. I know you’re attached to them. But 
do you have to bring them to math class?” 

Everyone laughed. Todd could feel his face growing hot. 

“Todd’s saving them for lunch!” Danny exclaimed from two rows behind 

him. 

Everyone laughed even louder. 

Thanks a bunch, Danny, Todd thought angrily. He scooped the worms up, 
carried them to the window, and lowered them to the ground. 

Later, in the lunchroom, Todd unwrapped his sandwich carefully. Peanut 
butter and jelly again. 

Danny leaned across the table, staring hard at the sandwich. 

“Go ahead. Open it,” he murmured. 

Todd hesitated, gripping the sandwich in both hands. 

How many worms would be crawling through the peanut butter this time? 
Two? Three? Ten ? 

“Go ahead,” Danny urged. “What are you waiting for?” 

Todd took a deep breath and held it. Then he slowly pulled apart the two 
slices of bread. 



20 


“No worm!” Todd declared. 

Both boys let out long sighs of relief. 

Danny sank back into his seat and picked up what was left of his ham 
sandwich. 

Todd didn’t eat. He stared thoughtfully at the peanut butter covered with 
smears of grape jelly. “They’re going to drive me totally crazy,” he muttered. 

“What?” Danny asked with a mouthful of sandwich. 

“Nothing,” Todd replied. His head itched. He pulled off his cap and reached 
up to scratch it. He expected to find a worm in his hair. But there wasn’t one. 

Every time he opened his bookbag, he expected to find worms. Every time 
he ate a meal, he expected to see a worm bobbing or wriggling or crawling or 
swimming through his food. 

He was starting to imagine worms everywhere. Everywhere. 

Todd had dinner at Danny’s that night. Danny’s mother served fried chicken and 
mashed potatoes. Then she and Danny’s father argued all through dinner about 
where to go on their vacation, and whether or not they should save the money 
and buy a couch instead. 

Danny seemed really embarrassed about his parents’ loud arguing. 

But Todd didn’t mind it at all. He was so happy to relax and eat and not 
worry about finding any long, purple worms on his plate or in his glass. 

He and Danny went up to Danny’s room and played video games for a few 
hours after dinner. Danny had a game called Worm Attack. Todd made him bury 
it deep in the closet. 

Danny’s father drove Todd home at about ten. Todd’s parents were already 
dressed for bed. “Your mom and I both had rough days,” Mr. Barstow explained. 
“We’re hitting the sack early. You can stay up and watch TV or something if you 
want, Todd.” 

Todd didn’t feel sleepy. So he went into the den and turned on the TV. He 
watched a Star Trek that he’d already seen. 

He was yawning and feeling tired by the time the show went off at eleven. 
He turned off all the lights and made his way up to his room. 



He realized he was feeling really good, really relaxed. I haven’t thought 
about worms all night, he told himself happily. 

He climbed out of his clothes, tossing them onto the floor, and pulled on his 
pajamas. A warm, soft wind was fluttering the curtains at the window. He could 
see a pale half-moon in the black nighttime sky. 

Clicking off the bed table lamp, Todd pulled back his covers and slipped 
into bed. 

He yawned loudly and shut his eyes. 

Tomorrow is Saturday, he thought happily. No school. 

He turned onto his stomach and buried his face in the pillow. 

He felt something wet and warm wriggle against his cheek. 

Then he felt something moving under his chest. 

“Oh!” He jerked himself upright, pulling himself up with both hands. 

A long, wet worm clung to the side of his face. 

He reached up and pulled it off. 

He jumped out of bed. It took a short while to find the bed table lamp in the 
darkness. Finally, he managed to click it on. 

Blinking in the light, he saw a worm stuck to the front of his pajama shirt. 
Three long, brown worms were crawling on his sheet. Two more were stretched 
out on the pillow. 

“No! No! Stop!” 

It took Todd a while to realize that the shrill screams were coming from 

him\ 

“I can’t take it anymore!” he shrieked, losing control. 

He pulled the worm off his pajama shirt and tossed it onto the bed beside 
the others. 

“Regina! Regina—you’ve got to stop it! You’ve got to!” Todd screamed. 

He spun around when he heard footsteps at the bedroom door. 

“Mom!” Todd wailed. “Mom—look!” He pointed frantically to the worms 
crawling on his pillow and bedsheet. 

Mrs. Barstow raised both hands to her cheeks in surprise. 

“Mom—you’ve got to stop Regina!” Todd pleaded. “You’ve got to stop 
her! Look what she did! Look what she put in my bed!” 

Mrs. Barstow moved quickly into the room and put an arm around Todd’s 
trembling shoulders. “But Regina isn’t here, Todd,” she said gently. 

“Huh?” He gaped at her in shock. 



“Regina is at a sleepover at Beth’s,” his mother explained. “Regina isn’t 



21 


“We’ll have to have a long discussion about this in the morning,” Mrs. Barstow 
said, her arm still around Todd’s shoulders. “Maybe your worms are escaping 
from the tank somehow.” 

“Maybe,” Todd replied doubtfully. 

His mother lowered her eyes to the bed. “Yuck. Take the worms back 
downstairs, Todd, and I’ll change the sheets.” 

Todd obediently lifted the worms off the sheet and pillowcase. Two of them 
were mashed. But the rest were wriggling and squirming. 

They’re taking their revenge, Todd thought with a shudder as he carried 
them out of the room. 

Regina was right. 

The worms are paying me back. 

The worms dangled from his hand as he carried them down to the 
basement. He dropped them into the tank. Then he leaned over it, staring down 
into the soft, wet dirt. 

Most of the worms were below the surface. But a few crawled across the 

top. 

“Hey, guys,” Todd called down to them, lowering his face over the top of 
the glass aquarium. “Hey, guys—can you hear me?” 

He had never talked to his worms before. And he felt very uncomfortable 
talking to them now. 

But he was desperate. 

“Listen, guys, I’m really sorry,” Todd said, speaking softly. He didn’t want 
his voice to carry upstairs. If his mom or dad heard him talking to the worms, 
they’d know he was totally Looney Tunes. 

“I’m really sorry about what happened,” he told them. “I mean, about 
cutting that one in half. It will never happen again. I promise.” 

Leaning over the tank, he stared down into the dirt. The worms didn’t seem 
to be paying any attention to him. Two of them were crawling against one of the 
glass walls. Another was burrowing into the dirt. 

“So do you think you can stop following me around?” Todd continued, 
giving it one last try. “I mean, I don’t want to get rid of you all. I’ve been 



collecting worms for a long time. But if you keep this up, well... you’ll all have 
to go.” 

Todd lifted his head out and stood up straight. I can’t believe I just did that, 
he thought. 

Maybe I am totally nuts. 

He glanced quickly around the basement, expecting Regina and his parents 
to pop out from behind the furnace, crying, “April fool!” 

But no one else was down there. Luckily, no one had seen him actually 
pleading with the worms! 

Feeling really foolish and confused, Todd trudged back up to his room. His 
mother was waiting for him in the hall outside his room. “What took so long?” 

“Nothing,” Todd muttered, feeling himself blush. 

She swept a hand through his wavy, dark hair. “I never get to see your hair,” 
she said, smiling. “It’s always under that awful cap.” 

“Yeah. I know.” Todd yawned. 

“Go change your pajamas,” she instructed him. “Those have worm juice all 
over them. I’ll run you a hot bath.” 

“No. No bath,” Todd said sharply. “I’m too tired.” 

“You don’t want a bath after rolling around on worms?” Mrs. Barstow 
demanded. 

“Tomorrow. Okay?” he pleaded. 

“Okay,” she agreed. “But change your pajamas. Good night.” 

Todd watched her make her way downstairs. Then he returned to his room 
and changed into clean pajamas. He inspected the bed carefully, even though the 
sheets were new. Then he examined the pillow. 

When he was certain there were no worms, he turned off the light and 
slipped into bed. 

Lying on his back, he stared out the window at the pale half-moon—and 
thought about the worms. 

Regina was sleeping over at Beth’s—but the bed was full of worms. 

How? 

How were they wriggling into his backpack? Into his notebooks? Into his 
breakfast? His lunch? 

The room began to whirl. Todd felt dizzy. So sleepy. So very sleepy... 

But he couldn’t stop puzzling about the worms. Such a mystery. 

The night sky grew darker. The moon rose away from the window. 



It’s so late, Todd thought, and I can’t get to sleep. 

Maybe I do need a hot bath, he told himself, lowering his feet to the floor. 
Baths always relaxed him. 

He crept silently out of his room and down the hall to the bathroom. He 
didn’t want to wake his parents. Closing the bathroom door behind him, he 
clicked on the light. Then he turned on the water and filled the tub, making it 
nice and hot. 

When the water was nearly to the top, he pulled off his pajamas. Then he 
lowered himself into the steamy water. “Mmmmmm,” he hummed aloud as he 
settled into it. The hot water felt so good, so soothing. 

This was a good idea, he told himself, resting his head against the back of 
the tub. He smiled and shut his eyes. Just what I needed. 

A soft splash made Todd open his eyes and glance at the faucet. Had he 
forgotten to turn it off? 

Another splash. 

“Ohh.” Todd let out a soft moan as a fat purple worm slid out of the faucet 
and hit the water. “Oh, no!” 

Splash. 

Another worm dropped from the faucet. Then two more. They hit the 
surface of the water and plunged to the tub bottom just past Todd’s feet. 

“Hey—!” He pulled his feet away and drew himself up to a sitting position. 
“What’s going on?!” 

As Todd stared in horror, brown and purple worms tumbled from the faucet, 
three and four at a time, splashing into the tub. He raised his eyes to see more 
worms—sliding down the tile wall, plopping onto the water, onto his legs, onto 
his shoulders. 

“No—!” 

He struggled to climb out, trying to push himself to his feet with both 
hands. 

But the tub bottom was covered with wriggling, swimming, slithering 
worms. And his hands kept slipping out from under him. 

“Help—!” 

Breathing hard, he managed to climb to his knees. 

Worms clung to his back, his shoulders. He could feel them crawling over 
his hot, wet skin. 

More worms tumbled down the wall. They seemed to be raining from the 



ceiling. More and more poured out of the faucet. 

They had turned the entire tub into a seething, wriggling sea of brown and 
purple. 

“Help—somebody!” Todd shouted. 

But the worms were pulling him now. Pulling him down. 

He could feel their wet grasp, hundreds of tiny prickles, as they held him 
tightly and tugged him down, down, into the churning water. 

They plopped onto his head. Crawled over his face. Dangled from his 
quivering shoulders. 

Covered him. Covered him, and continued to rain down, to pour down, and 
pull him down with them, into the wriggling, dark sea of warm, wet worms. 



22 


“Please—help me! ” 

Todd struggled and squirmed. He twisted his body, trying to swing his arms 

free. 

But the worms held on, forcing him down, pulling him into the slimy, 
brown water. And more worms rained down, curling and uncurling as they slid 
down the wall, dropped from the ceiling, and poured from the faucet. 

“Oh!” 

He let out a startled cry as he tugged himself back to a sitting position. He 
thrashed his arms hard, sending a spray of water over the side of the tub. 

He blinked. Once. Twice. 

And the worms disappeared. All of them. 

“Huh?” His mouth dropped open as he gazed into the tub. The ceiling light 
reflected in the clear water. 

Hesitantly, he moved his toes. He splashed the water with both feet. 

Clear. Perfectly clear and clean. 

“Wow,” Todd murmured, shaking his head. “Wow.” 

The wriggling, tumbling worms lingered in his mind. Despite the heat of 
the bathwater, a cold shiver ran down his body. 

He climbed quickly out of the tub and wrapped a large, green bath towel 
around himself. 

A dream. It had all been a disgusting dream. 

He had fallen asleep in the bathtub and had dreamed up all of the worms. 

He shivered again. He still felt shaky. He could still feel the itchy pinpricks 
all over his body. 

Drying himself quickly, he let the towel slip to the floor and pulled on his 
pajamas. Then, as he hurried back to his room, eager to climb under the covers 
—he had an idea. 

He had an idea about how to solve the worm mystery. 

It was so simple, he realized. Such a simple plan. 

But it would tell him once and for all how the worms were escaping from 
their tank and getting into his things. 



“Yes!” he cried in an excited whisper. “Yes!” 

Finally, he had a plan. He knew exactly what to do. 

It will have to wait till Sunday night, he told himself, climbing into bed and 
pulling up the blankets. But I’ll be ready then. 

Ready for anything. 

Thinking about his plan, Todd fell asleep with a smile on his face. 

The weekend passed slowly. Todd and Danny went to a movie on Saturday. It 
was a comedy about space aliens trying to run a car wash. The aliens kept 
getting confused and washing themselves instead of the cars. In the end, they 
blew up the whole planet. 

Danny thought it was very funny. Todd thought it was dumb, but funny. 

On Sunday, Regina came home from Beth’s. The whole family drove 
upstate to visit some cousins. 

“It was a no-worms weekend,” Todd told Danny over the phone after dinner 
on Sunday evening. 

“Way to go!” Danny replied enthusiastically. 

“Not a single worm,” Todd told him, twisting the phone cord around his 
wrist. 

“So are you going ahead with your plan?” Danny demanded. 

“Yeah. Sure,” Todd said. “I have to. They just took the weekend off. For 
sure. Tomorrow is school. That means more worms in my backpack, in my 
books, in my lunch.” 

“Yuck,” Danny murmured on the other end of the line. 

“I’ve got to solve the mystery,” Todd told him. “I’ve got to.” 

“Well, good luck,” Danny said. “I’ll meet you tomorrow morning. Outside 
of Miss Grant’s class, okay? Get there early so you can tell me how it went.” 

“Okay,” Todd replied. “See you tomorrow.” As he hung up the phone, he 
felt excited and nervous and eager and frightened, all at the same time. 

He tried playing a Nintendo football game to pass the time. But he was so 
excited and nervous, he kept using the wrong fingers on the controller, and the 
machine beat him easily. 

Then he paced back and forth in his room, watching the clock slowly slide 
from number to number. 

At ten-thirty, he and Regina said good night to their parents and returned to 
their rooms. Todd changed into his pajamas, turned out the lights, then sat on the 



edge of his bed, waiting. 

Waiting for his parents to go to bed. 

He heard their door close at eleven-fifteen. Then he waited another fifteen 
minutes, sitting tensely in the dark, listening to the soft creaks and groans of the 
house, listening to the heavy silence. 

A little after eleven-thirty, Todd climbed out of his bed and tiptoed silently 
out of his room. 

It’s time, he told himself, creeping down the dark hall to the stairs. Time to 
get to the bottom of this. 

Time to solve the mystery of the worms. 



23 


The basement stairs creaked loudly under Todd’s bare feet. But there was 
nothing he could do about that. 

He tried to move as silently as a mouse. He didn’t want to alert anyone in 
his family that he was awake. He grabbed the wall and caught his balance as he 
started to stumble on the basement steps. 

Taking a deep breath, he stopped and listened. Had anyone heard him? 

Silence. 

The wooden steps were steep and rickety. But Todd couldn’t turn on the 
lights. He didn’t want anyone to see him. 

Not even the worms. 

A pale square of light spread across the basement floor, moonlight pouring 
through the narrow window up near the basement ceiling. Todd stepped around 
the light, keeping in the dark shadows. 

His heart pounded as he made his way slowly, carefully across the room. 
“Ow!” He let out a whispered cry as he banged his waist into the corner of the 
Ping-Pong table. He quickly covered his mouth before he could cry out again. 

The pain slowly faded. Rubbing his side, Todd picked up a tall stool and 
carried it over to one of the concrete beams that rose from floor to ceiling. 

He set the stool down slowly, carefully. Gazing around the beam, he could 
see the worm tank on its table. The glass tank reflected the glow of the 
moonlight that invaded the dark basement. 

Todd lifted himself silently onto the stool. Hidden behind the square 
concrete beam, he could watch the worms—but they couldn’t see him. 

He gripped his hands around the beam and steadied himself on the tall 
stool. Glancing up, he saw the high window, filled with moonlight, glow like 
silver. The light cast eerie shadows over the entire basement. 

Todd forced his breathing to slow to normal. 

Got to take it easy. It may be a long wait, he told himself. I may be sitting 
here, watching the worm tank all night. 

What did he expect to see? 

He wasn’t sure. But he knew something would happen. Something would 
happen to explain the mystery of the worms to him. 



Leaning against the beam, Todd stared at the glass aquarium tank. Were the 
worms plotting and planning inside? Were they deciding which ones of them 
would crawl upstairs and climb into Todd’s things? 

Todd suddenly imagined a different story. Glancing back at the silvery 
basement window, he imagined it opening. He imagined a dark figure sliding 
into the basement. Patrick. He imagined Patrick lowering himself onto the 
basement floor, then crossing the room to the worm tank. 

He imagined Patrick pulling up worms from the tank and sneaking upstairs 
with them. Todd could see Patrick grinning as he dropped the worms into Todd’s 
backpack, slipped one into the cornflakes box, hid one in Todd’s sneaker. 

It’s possible, Todd told himself, turning his attention back to the worms. It 
isn’t a totally crazy idea. It isn’t as crazy an idea as a bunch of worms planning 
their revenge.... 

He yawned, covering his mouth so the worms wouldn’t hear. 

How long will I have to sit here? he wondered. He felt a chill at the back of 
his neck. It was creepy down here in the dark. 

What were those soft skittering sounds? 

Mice? 

He didn’t have long to think about them. A loud creak behind him made 
Todd gasp. 

He gripped the concrete beam. 

The stairs began to groan. 

He heard the slow thud of footsteps. Footsteps growing louder, moving 
down the stairs. 

Todd lowered his feet to the floor. He pressed himself tightly behind the 
beam, trying to hide. 

The stairs creaked and groaned. 

The thud of footsteps stopped at the bottom of the steps. Todd squinted hard 
into the darkness. 

Who was it? Who was sneaking down to the basement? 

Who was sneaking down to the worm tank? 

Who? 



24 


Todd gasped as the ceiling lights flickered on. It took a second or two for his 
eyes to adjust to the bright fluorescent light. 

Then he saw the figure standing at the light switch. 

“Dad! ” Todd cried. 

Mr. Barstow jumped in surprise. He had a yellow bathrobe slung loosely 
around him. He carried one of Todd’s baseball bats in both hands, raised waist 
high. 

“Dad—what are you doing down here?” Todd cried shrilly. 

Todd’s father lowered the baseball bat. His mouth dropped open as he 
squinted across the room at Todd. “What are you doing down here?” he 
demanded. 

“I’m... uh... watching the worms,” Todd confessed. 

Mr. Barstow let the bat drop to the floor. It clanked noisily at his feet. He 
made his way quickly over to Todd, carefully stepping around the Ping-Pong 
table. 

“I heard the basement steps creaking,” he told Todd. “I heard a crash down 
here, someone banging into the Ping-Pong table. I—I thought it was a burglar. 
So I grabbed the bat and came down to investigate.” 

“It’s just me, Dad,” Todd said. “I had to find out how my worms are getting 
into my stuff. Sol decided to watch them all night and see if—” 

“I’ve had it with those worms!” Mr. Barstow exclaimed angrily. 

“But, Dad—” Todd protested. 

“What’s going on down there? Are you okay?” Mrs. Barstow called from 
the top of the stairs. 

“Everything is okay, dear!” Todd’s father called. “It’s just more worm 
trouble.” 

“Those disgusting worms again? Come up here and get back to bed,” Mrs. 
Barstow ordered. Todd could hear her padding back to her room. 

“Those worms are out of here tomorrow,” Mr. Barstow said sternly, 
tightening the belt of the yellow robe. 

“What?” Todd cried. “Dad, please—” 

“Enough is enough, Todd. I don’t understand what’s been going on with 



your worms,” his father said, frowning, resting his hands on his waist. “But I 
can’t have you scaring everyone in the house, sneaking around in the middle of 
the night, sitting in the dark, staring at a tank of worms instead of getting your 
sleep.” 

“But—but—” Todd sputtered. 

Mr. Barstow shook his head. “My mind is made up. No discussion. The 
worms go. Tomorrow afternoon, take them outside and dump them all in the 
garden.” 

“But, Dad—” 

Mr. Barstow raised a hand for silence. “I mean it. In the garden. Tomorrow 
afternoon. I’m sure you can find something better to collect than worms.” 

He placed both hands on Todd’s shoulders and marched him toward the 
stairs. 

Todd sighed unhappily, but didn’t say any more. He knew better than to 
argue with his father. When his dad made up his mind about something, he could 
be very stubborn. 

Todd climbed the rest of the way to his room in silence, feeling angry and 
disappointed. 

As he dropped onto his bed and jerked up the covers, he grumbled to 
himself about the most disappointing thing of all—he hadn’t solved the mystery. 

All that planning. All that sneaking around. 

He’d had such high hopes for getting to the bottom of it once and for all. 

But, no. 

Not only was he about to lose all of his worms, but now he would never 
know how the worms got into his things. 

I don’t care about those stupid worms! he told himself. I don’t care that I 
have to throw them all away! 

All I really care about is solving the mystery! 

Angry and frustrated, Todd turned and started to punch his pillow. Hard. 
With both fists. Again. Again. 

He didn’t realize that the whole mystery would be solved—accidentally— 
just a few hours later. 



25 


It rained the next morning. Todd didn’t even notice as he walked slowly to 
school. His thoughts were darker than the storm clouds over his head. 

He dropped his jacket in his locker and pulled out his Trapper-Keeper. 
Stuffing it into his rain-drenched backpack, he spotted Danny. 

As planned, Danny was waiting outside the classroom door. Waiting to hear 
how Todd had solved the worm mystery. 

Well, I guess Danny will just have to be disappointed, too, Todd thought 
glumly. He straightened his Raiders cap and, hoisting his wet backpack onto his 
shoulders, made his way across the hall to his friend. 

Danny’s red hair was soaked and matted down on his head. It looked more 
like a helmet than hair. 

Todd pushed his way through a group of laughing, shouting kids, all 
shaking rainwater off themselves, puddles on the hall floor at their feet. 

“So? How’d it go?” Danny asked eagerly as Todd stepped up to him. 

Todd started to tell his friend the bad news—but he stopped when he heard 
a voice he instantly recognized. 

Regina! 

Around the corner, out of view of the two boys, Regina and Beth were 
sharing a good laugh. 

“So he has to dump out all those gross worms today!” Regina was gleefully 
telling Beth. “Isn’t that awesome?” 

“Awesome!” Beth declared. 

Both girls laughed. 

“Todd is such a jerk!” Beth exclaimed. “Did he really think the worms were 
crawling upstairs on their own? Did he really think they were coming to get 
him?” 

“Yeah. I think he did!” Regina said through her scornful laughter. 

Around the corner from the two girls, Danny and Todd stood listening in 
shock. Neither of them moved a muscle. Todd’s mouth had dropped open. He 
could feel his face growing red-hot. 

“So today’s the last day?” Beth was saying. “Did you put any worms in his 
stuff today?” 



“Only two,” Regina replied. “Mom gave him a thermos of hot vegetable 
soup since it’s such a nasty day. I dropped one in the thermos. And I slipped one 
into his jacket pocket. He’s on his way to school. He probably stuck his hand in 
and found my little surprise.” 

Both girls laughed again. 

“And he never guessed it was you the whole time?” Beth asked Regina. 

“He guessed,” Regina replied. “But I’m such a good actress. I acted 
shocked and totally grossed out. Pretty soon, he didn’t know what to think!” 

They laughed some more. Then Todd heard them head the other way down 
the hall. 

He turned to find Danny staring at him. “Todd—do you believe it? It was 
your sister the whole time!” 

“I knew it,” Todd lied, trying to sound casual. “I knew it was Regina.” 

“Well, what are you going to do?” Danny demanded, still staring hard at 
Todd. 

“Get revenge, of course,” Todd replied quickly. 

“Revenge? How?” his friend asked. 

“I’m not sure,” Todd told him. “I just know it’s going to take a lot of 
worms! ” 



26 


The rain stopped after lunch. The heavy, dark clouds drifted away, and bright 
sunshine poured down from a clear blue sky. 

Todd eagerly watched the weather change through the classroom windows. 
The sunshine filled him with hope. 

This means the worms will be coming up from the ground, he thought 
happily. Dozens and dozens of worms. 

He was desperate to get out and collect them. He was going to need a ton of 
worms to pay his sister back for her mean joke. 

Unfortunately, just before school let out, he and Danny were caught having 
a glue fight during art class. Ms. Travianti, the art teacher, made them both stay 
after school and clean up all the paintbrushes. 

It was nearly four o’clock when Todd led the way to his favorite worm¬ 
collecting spot behind second base of the softball diamond. The playground was 
deserted. There were no other kids in sight. 

Todd and Danny both carried empty coffee cans they had borrowed from 
the art room. Without saying a word, they bent down and set to work, pulling up 
long, brown and purple worms, and dropping them into the cans. 

“How many do we need?” Danny asked, poking in the soft mud till he 
found a big wet one. 

“As many as we can get,” Todd replied. He still hadn’t figured out exactly 
what he was going to do to Regina. He just knew it was going to be totally 
awesome. And gross. 

“You really should pay back Beth, too,” Danny suggested. He dug a hole 
with his chubby hand and discovered three big worms tangled together. 

“Yeah. You’re right,” Todd agreed. “We’ll save a bunch for Beth.” 

Todd stood up and pulled off his jacket. Even though it was late afternoon, 
the sun still beamed down. He was already sweating. 

“Look at this one!” Danny declared. He held up a stubby pink worm. 

“It’s just a baby,” Todd said. “Toss it in the can, anyway. I need as many as 
I can get. Big or little.” 

Danny dropped the stubby pink worm in with the others. 

Todd pulled up a really long one. He carefully brushed clumps of mud off it 



before dropping it in the can. “The rain always brings up the really big ones,” he 
told Danny. 

The ground rumbled. 

At first Todd didn’t notice. 

“Did you feel that?” Danny asked. 

“Feel what?” 

The ground shook again. 

Todd heard a low rumbling sound, like distant thunder. 

“Hey—!” Danny cried, alarmed. He stopped digging. 

“That always happens,” Todd told him. “No big deal. Keep digging.” 

Danny dug his hand back into the mud. But he jerked it out quickly when 
the ground shook again, harder this time. “Hey—why is this happening again?” 
he cried. 

“I told you. It’s nothing,” Todd insisted. 

But then a loud roar made them both cry out. 

The entire playground seemed to tremble. The roar grew louder, closer. 

The ground shook. Then both boys heard a cracking sound. 

Todd started to his feet. But the ground shook so hard, he tumbled back 
down to his knees. 

Craaaaaack. 

“Oh, no!” Danny cried. 

They both saw the dirt pull apart between them. It looked like a dark wound 
opening up. 

Another rumble. The ground quivered and shook. The mud split open. 
Wider. 

Wider. 

And something poked up from under the ground. 

At first, Todd thought it was a tree trunk. 

It was dark brown like a tree trunk. And round like a tree trunk. 

But it was moving too fast to be a tree, rising up from the opening in the 

mud. 

And as the ground shook and the rumbling rose to a roar, Todd and Danny 
both realized that they were gaping in horror at a giant worm. 

A worm as thick as a tree trunk. 

Up, up it stretched, up from the mud, darting and dipping its enormous 
head. 



Todd uttered a shriek of terror, and turned to run. 

But his feet slipped on the wet, quivering mud. He fell forward, landing 
hard on his knees and elbows. 

And before he could pull himself up, the enormous worm swung around 
him, swung around his waist, circled him, pulled itself tight. 

“Ohhh!” he uttered a cry of panic. 

A crazy thought burst into Todd’s head: This is the mother worm. She’s 
come up to protect her babies. 

And then another crazy thought: The worms are really getting their revenge 
this time! 

And then he had no more time for crazy thoughts. Or any other kinds of 
thoughts. 

Because the enormous worm was tightening itself around Todd’s waist, 
choking off his breath, choking him, choking him. 

Pulling him. Tugging him down into the mud, down into its cavernous hole. 

He tried to call for help. 

But no sound came out of his mouth. 

He couldn’t yell. He couldn’t breathe. 

The huge, wet worm was crushing him, crushing him as it pulled him down. 

And then a dark shadow rolled over Todd. And everything went black. 



27 


Danny grabbed Todd’s feet and tried to pull him free. 

But the worm had wrapped itself around Todd’s waist like a tight belt. 
Danny pulled Todd’s ankles. Pulled hard. 

But he couldn’t free his friend. 

And now the worm was disappearing back into the gaping hole in the mud, 
and taking Todd down with him. 

And suddenly they were all covered in shadow. 

“Huh?” Danny let out a startled gasp. 

And raised his eyes to see what caused the shadow. 

And saw the enormous robin bouncing along over the grass. 

“Hey!” he frantically called out. “Regina! Beth!” 

They were carrying the big papier-mache bird home from school. He 
couldn’t see their faces. They were hidden on the other side of the enormous 
robin. 

“Regina! Help us!” 

And then the bird’s shadow rolled over Danny and Todd. 

And the worm jerked straight up. And began to tremble. 

Did it see the shadow of the bird? 

It jerked straight up—and let go of Todd. 

Todd slid to the ground. And the quivering worm began to lower itself. 
Instantly, with a sickening sucking sound, it dove back into the mud. 

Gasping for breath, Todd scrambled away on all fours. 

The worm—it thinks Christopher Robin is a real bird! he realized. 

When he glanced back, the worm had vanished back under the ground. 

“Regina! Beth!” Todd and Danny shouted together. 

The two girls slowly lowered their science project to the ground. “What do 
you want? What are you two doing here?” Regina demanded, poking her head 
around from the other side of the enormous robin. 

“Did you see it?” Todd cried breathlessly. “Did you see the worm?” 

“It was so huge!” Danny added, pulling Todd to his feet. “It was as tall as a 
building!” 



“Ha-ha,” Beth said sarcastically. “You guys must think we’re really dumb.” 

“No way we’re going to believe you caught a giant worm!” Regina added, 
shaking her head. 

“You didn’t see it?” Todd cried weakly. “You really didn’t see it?” 

“We’re not making it up!” Danny shouted angrily. “It grabbed Todd. It was 
huge and brown and slimy! It was pulling Todd down.” 

“Give us a break,” Beth groaned. 

“Go eat worms,” Regina said. 

They hoisted up their giant robin and continued their slow trek toward the 
street. 

Todd watched the bird’s wide shadow roll over the grass. The shadow that 
had saved his life. 

Then he turned to Danny with a weary shrug. “Might as well go home,” he 
said softly. “I’m not sure I believe it myself.” 

Todd tossed all of his worms into the garden that afternoon. He told everyone he 
never wanted to see a worm again. 

When Danny came over to Todd’s house a few weeks later, he found Todd down 
in the basement, busy with a new hobby. “What are you doing?” Danny asked. 

Todd’s eyes remained on the fluttering creature inside the glass jar on the 
worktable. “I’m chloroforming this butterfly,” he told his friend. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” Danny asked. 

“I dipped a wad of cotton in chloroform and dropped it into the jar. It will 
kill the butterfly. Watch.” 

When the gold-and-black butterfly stopped fluttering, Todd carefully 
opened the jar. He lifted the butterfly out with long tweezers and gently spread 
its wings. Then he hung it on a board by sticking a long pin through its middle. 

“You’re collecting butterflies now?” Danny asked in surprise. 

Todd nodded. “Butterflies are so gentle, so pretty,” he said, concentrating 
on his work. 

“Todd has changed a lot,” Regina announced, appearing at the bottom of 
the stairs. “He isn’t into qross anymore. Now he’s into things that are soft and 
beautiful.” 

“Let me show you some of my most beautiful butterfly specimens,” Todd 
told Danny. “I have a few monarchs that will knock your eyes out.” 



Everyone was happy about Todd’s new hobby. Especially Regina. There were no 
more cruel practical jokes played in the Barstow house. 

Then, one night, Todd gazed up from his worktable—and uttered a horrified 
cry as he saw the big creature fluttering toward him. 

An enormous butterfly. 

As big as a bedsheet! 

Carrying an enormous silver pin. 

“What are you going to do?” Todd cried. 




GHOST BEACH 


Goosebumps - 22 
R.L. Stine 


1 


I don’t remember how we got to the graveyard. 

I remember the sky grew dark—and we were there. 

My sister Terri and I walked past rows of crooked, old tombstones, cracked 
and covered with moss. Even though it was summer, a damp, gray fog had 
settled on everything, sending a chill through the air. 

I shivered and pulled my jacket closer. “Wait up, Terri!” I called. As usual, 
she had plowed ahead. Graveyards get her all excited. “Where are you?” I 
yelled. 

I squinted into the gray fog. I could see her shadowy figure up ahead, 
stopping every few seconds to examine a tombstone. 

I read the words on the tombstone tilted at my feet: 

In memory of John, 
son of Daniel and Sarah Knapp, 
who died March 25,1766, 
aged 12 years and 22 days. 

Weird, I thought. That kid was about my age when he died. I turned twelve 
in February. The same month Terri turned eleven. 

I hurried on. A sharp wind swept in. I searched the rows of old graves for 
my sister. She had disappeared into the thick fog. “Terri? Where did you go?” I 
called. 

Her voice floated back to me. “I’m over here, Jerry.” 

“Where?” I pushed forward through the mist and the leaves. The wind 
swirled around me. 

From nearby came a long, low howl. “Must be a dog,” I murmured aloud. 

The trees rattled their leaves at me. I shivered. 

“Jer-ry.” Terri’s voice sounded a million miles away. 

I walked a little further, then steadied myself against a tall tombstone. 
“Terri! Wait up! Stop moving around so much!” 

I heard another long howl. 



“You’re going the wrong way,” Terri called. “I’m over here.” 

“Great. Thanks a lot,” I muttered. Why couldn’t I have a sister who liked 
baseball instead of exploring old cemeteries? 

The wind made a deep sucking noise. A column of leaves, dust, and dirt 
swirled up in my face. I pinched my eyes shut. 

When I opened them, I saw Terri crouched over a small grave. “Don’t 
move,” I called. “I’m coming.” 

I zigzagged my way around the tombstones until I reached her side. “It’s 
getting dark,” I said. “Let’s get out of here.” 

I turned and took a step—and something grabbed my ankle. 

I screamed and tried to pull away. But its grasp tightened. 

A hand. Reaching up through the dirt beside the grave. 

I let out a shrill scream. Terri screamed, too. 

I kicked hard and broke free. 

“Run!” Terri shrieked. 

But I was already running. 

As Terri and I stumbled over the wet grass, green hands popped up 
everywhere. Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Pop! Pop! 

The hands rose up. Reached for us. Grabbed at our ankles. 

I darted to the left. Thwack! I dodged to the right. Pop! 

“Run, Terri! Run!” I called to my sister. “Lift your knees!” 

I could hear her sneakers pounding the ground behind me. Then I heard her 
terrified cry: “Jerry! They’ve got me!” 

With a loud gasp, I spun around. Two big hands had wrapped themselves 
around her ankles. 

I froze, watching my sister struggle. 

“Jerry—help me! It won’t let go!” 

Taking a deep breath, I dove toward her. “Grab on to me,” I instructed, 
holding out my arms. 

I kicked at the two hands that held her. 

Kicked as hard as I could. But they didn’t move, didn’t let go. 

“I—I can’t move!” Terri wailed. 

The dirt seemed to shake at my feet. I peered down to see more hands 
sprouting up from the ground. 

I tugged at Terri’s waist. “Move!” I yelled frantically. 

“I can’t!” 



“Yes, you can! You’ve got to keep trying!” 

“Ohhh!” I let out a low cry as two hands grabbed my ankles. 
Now I was caught. 

We were both trapped.

“Jerry! What’s your problem?” Terri asked. 

I blinked. Terri stood beside me on a rocky strip of beach. I stared out at the 
calm ocean water beyond us and shook my head. “Wow. That was weird,” I 
murmured. “I was remembering a bad dream I had a few months ago.” 

Terri frowned at me. “Why now?” 

“It was about a cemetery,” I explained. I turned back to glance at the tiny, 
old cemetery we’d just discovered at the edge of the pine woods behind us. “In 
my dream, green hands were popping out of the ground and grabbing our 
ankles.” 

“Gross,” Terri replied. She brushed her dark brown bangs off her face. 
Except for the fact that she is one inch taller than me, we look like a perfect 
brother-sister combination. Same short brown hair, same freckles across our 
nose, same hazel eyes. 

One difference: Terri has deep dimples in her cheeks when she smiles, and I 
don’t. Thank goodness. 

We walked along the ocean shore for a few minutes. Tall, gray boulders and 
scraggly pines stretched all the way to the water. 

“Maybe you remembered that dream because you’re nervous,” Terri said 
thoughtfully. “You know. About being away from home for a whole month.” 

“Well, maybe,” I agreed. “We’ve never been away this long. But what could 
happen here? Brad and Agatha are really great.” 

Brad Sadler is our distant cousin. Ancient, distant cousin is more like it. 
Dad said Brad and his wife, Agatha, were old when he was a kid! 

But they’re both fun, and really energetic despite their age. So when they 
invited us to come up to New England and spend the last month of summer with 
them in their old cottage near the beach, Terri and I eagerly said yes. It sounded 
great—especially since our only other choice was the cramped, hot apartment 
where we live in New Jersey. 

We had arrived by train that morning. Brad and Agatha met us at the 
platform and drove us along the pine woods to the cottage. 

After we had a chance to unpack and have some lunch—big bowls of 
creamy clam chowder—Agatha said, “Now why don’t you kids have a look 



around? There’s lots to explore.” 

So here we were, checking things out. Terri grabbed my arm. “Hey, let’s go 
back and check out that little cemetery!” she suggested eagerly. 

“I don’t know...” My frightening dream was still fresh in my mind. 

“Oh, come on. There won’t be any green hands. I promise. And I bet I can 
find some really cool gravestones for rubbings.” 

Terri loves exploring old graveyards. She loves all kinds of scary things. 
She reads scary mysteries by the dozen. And the weird thing is, she always reads 
the last chapter first. 

Terri has to solve the mystery. She can’t stand not knowing the answer. 

My sister has a million interests, but gravestone mbbings is one of her 
stranger hobbies. She tapes a piece of rice paper over the gravestone inscription 
and then rubs the design onto the paper, using the side of a special wax crayon. 

“Hey! Wait up,” I called to her. 

But Terri was already jogging up the beach toward the cemetery. “Come on, 
Jerry,” she called. “Don’t be a chicken.” 

I followed her off the beach and into the small forest. It smelled fresh and 
piney. The cemetery was just inside, surrounded by a crumbly stone wall. We 
squeezed through the narrow opening in the wall that led inside. 

Terri began inspecting the tombstones. “Wow. Some of these markers are 
really old,” she announced. “Check out this one.” 

She pointed at a small gravestone. Engraved on the front was a skull with 
wings sprouting on either side of its head. 

“It’s a death’s-head,” my sister explained. “Very old Puritan symbol. 
Creepy, huh?” She read the inscription: “'Here lies the body of Mr. John Sadler, 
who departed this life March 18, 1642, in the 38th year of his age.’” 

“Sadler. Like us,” I said. “Wow. I wonder if we’re related.” I did some 
quick calculations. “If we are, John Sadler is our great-great-great-great- 
grandsomething. He died over 350 years ago.” 

Terri had already moved on to another group of markers. “Here’s one from 
1647, and another from 1652. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten rubbings this old 
before.” She disappeared behind a tall tombstone. 

I knew where we’d be spending the month. I’d had enough of cemeteries 
for today, though. 

“Come on. Let’s explore the beach, okay?” I checked around for Terri. 
“Terri? Where’d you go?” I stepped over to the tall tombstone. 



Not there. 

“Terri?” The ocean breeze rustled the pine branches above us. “Terri, cut it 
out, okay?” 

I took a couple of steps. “You know I don’t like this,” I warned. 

Terri’s head popped up from behind a tombstone about ten feet away. 
“Why? You scared?” 

I didn’t like the grin on her face. “Who, me?” I said. “Never!” 

Terri stood up. “Okay, chicken. But I’m coming back here tomorrow.” She 
followed me out of the cemetery and onto the rocky beach. 

“I wonder what’s down here,” I said, heading along the shoreline. 

“Oh, look at this.” Terri stooped to pluck a tiny yellow-and-white 
wildflower that had sprouted up between two large rocks. “Butter-and-eggs,” she 
announced. “Weird name for a wildflower, huh?” 

“Very,” I agreed. Terri Sadler Hobby Number Two: wildflowers. She likes 
to collect them and press them in a huge cardboard contraption called a plant 
press. 

Terri frowned. “Now what’s your problem?” 

“We keep stopping. I want to go exploring. Agatha said there’s a small 
beach down here where we can go swimming if we want.” 

“Okay, okay,” she replied, rolling her hazel eyes. 

We trudged on until we reached a small, sandy beach. It was really more 
rock than sand. Staring out to the water, I saw a long rock jetty stretching out 
into the ocean. 

“Wonder what that’s for,” Terri said. 

“It helps hold the beach together,” I explained. I was just about to launch 
into my explanation of beach erosion when Terri gasped. 

“Jerry—look! Up there!” she cried. She pointed to a tall mound of rocks 
just past the jetty along the shoreline. Nestled high into the rocks, on top of a 
wide ledge, sat a large, dark cave. 

“Let’s climb up and explore it,” Terri cried eagerly. 

“No, wait!” I remembered what Mom and Dad had said to me that morning 
as we boarded the train: Keep an eye on Terri and don’t let her get too carried 
away with things. “It might be dangerous,” I said. I am the older brother, after 
all. And I’m the sensible one. 

She made a face. “Give me a break,” she muttered. Terri made her way 
across the beach and toward the cave. “At least let’s get a closer look. We can 



ask Brad and Agatha later whether or not it’s safe.” 

I followed behind her. “Yeah, right. Like ninety-year-olds ever go cave 
exploring.” 

As we came nearer, I had to admit it was an awesome cave. I’d never seen 
one that large except in an old Boy Scout magazine. 

“I wonder if someone lives in it,” Terri said excitedly. “You know. Like a 
beach hermit.” She cupped her hands around her mouth and called: “Whooooo!” 

Sometimes Terri can be such a dork. I mean, if you were living inside a 
cave, and you heard someone go “whoooo,” would you answer back? 

“Whoooo!” My sister did it again. 

“Let’s go,” I urged. 

Then, from inside the cave, a long, low whistle pierced the air. 

We stared at each other. 

“Whoa! What was that?” Terri whispered. “An owl?” 

I swallowed. “I don’t think so. Owls are only awake at night.” 

We heard it again. A long whistle floating out from deep inside the cave. 

We exchanged glances. What could it be? A wolf? A coyote? 

“I bet Brad and Agatha are wondering where we are,” Terri said softly. 
“Maybe we should go.” 

“Yeah. Okay.” I turned to leave. But stopped when I heard a fluttering 
sound. From behind the cave. Growing louder. 

I shielded my eyes with my hand and squinted up at the sky. 

“No!” I grabbed Terri’s arm as a shadow swept over us—and an enormous 
bat swooped down at us, red eyes flashing, its pointed teeth glistening, hissing as 
it attacked. 



3 


The bat swooped low. So low, I could feel the air from its fluttering wings. 

Terri and I dropped to the hard ground. I covered my head with both hands. 

My heart was pounding so loudly, I couldn’t hear the fluttering wings. 

“Hey—where’d it go?” I heard Terri cry. 

I peeped out. I could see the bat spiralling up into the sky. I watched it 
swoosh and dip beyond us. Then suddenly it went into a wild spin. 

It crashed onto the rocks nearby. I could see one black wing flapping 
weakly in the breeze. 

Slowly, I climbed to my feet, my heart still thudding. “What made it drop 
like that?” I asked in a shaky voice. I started toward it. 

Terri held me back. “Stay away. Bats can carry rabies, you know.” 

“I’m not going to get that close,” I told her. “I just want to take a look. I’ve 
never seen a real bat close up.” I guess you could say that my hobby is science, 
too. I love studying about all kinds of animals. 

“Here. Check it out,” I announced, scrambling over the smooth, gray 
boulders. 

“Careful, Jerry,” warned Terri. “If you get rabies, you’ll get me in trouble.” 

“Thanks for your concern,” I muttered sarcastically. 

I stopped about four feet from the bat. “Whoa! I don’t believe it!” I cried. 

I heard Terri burst out laughing. 

It wasn’t a bat. It was a kite. 

I stared in disbelief. The two red eyes that had seemed so menacing were 
painted on paper! One of the wings had been ripped to shreds when it crashed on 
the rocks. 

We both bent over to examine the wreckage. 

“Look out! It bites!” a boy’s voice called from behind us. 

Startled, Terri and I leaped back. I turned and saw a boy about our age, 
standing on a tall rock. He had a ball of string in his hand. 

“Ha-ha. Great joke,” Terri said sarcastically. 

The boy grinned at us, but didn’t reply. He stepped closer. I could see that 
he had freckles across his nose just like me, and brown hair the same shade as 



mine. He turned back toward the rocks and called, “You can come out now.” 

Two kids, a girl about our age and a little boy about five, clambered over 
the rocks. The little boy had light blond hair and blue eyes, and his ears poked 
out. The girl’s hair was auburn, and she wore it in braids. A11 three of them had 
the same freckles across their noses. 

“Are you all in the same family?” Terri asked them. 

The tallest boy, the one who had come out first, nodded his head. “Yeah. 
We’re all Sadlers. I’m Sam. That’s Louisa. That’s Nat.” 

“Wow,” I said. “We’re Sadlers, too.” I introduced Terri and myself. 

Sam didn’t seem impressed. “There’re lots of Sadlers around here,” he 
muttered. 

We stared at each other for a long moment. They didn’t seem very friendly. 
But then Sam surprised me by asking if I wanted to skip rocks in the water. 

We followed Sam to the water’s edge. 

“Do you live around here?” Terri asked. 

Louisa nodded. “What are you doing here?” she asked. She sounded 
suspicious. 

“We’re visiting our cousins for the month,” Terri told her. “They’re Sadlers, 
too. They live in the little cottage just past the lighthouse. Do you know them?” 

“Sure,” said Louisa without smiling. “This is a small place. Everyone 
knows everyone else.” 

I found a smooth, flat stone and skipped it across the water. Three skips. 
Not bad. “What do you do for fun around here?” I asked. 

Louisa replied, staring out at the water. “We go blueberry picking, we play 
games, we come down to the water.” She turned to me. “Why? What did you do 
today?” 

“Nothing yet. We just got here,” I told her. I grinned. “Except we were 
attacked by a bat kite.” 

They laughed. 

“I’m going to do gravestone rubbings and collect wildflowers,” Terri said. 

“There are some beautiful flower patches back in the woods,” Louisa told 
her. 

I watched Sam skip a stone across the water. Seven skips. 

He turned to me and grinned. “Practice makes perfect.” 

“It’s hard to practice in an apartment building,” I muttered. 

“Huh?” Sam said. 



“We live in Hoboken,” I explained. “In New Jersey. There aren’t any ponds 
in our building.” 

Terri pointed back at the cave. “Do you ever go exploring in there?” she 
asked. 

Nat gasped. Sam and Louisa’s faces twisted in surprise. “Are you kidding?” 
Louisa cried. 

“We never go near there,” Sam said softly, eyeing his sister. 

“Never?” Terri asked. 

All three of them shook their heads. 

“Why not?” Terri asked. “What’s the big deal?” 

“Yeah,” I demanded. “Why won’t you go near the cave?” 

Louisa’s eyes grew wide. “Do you believe in ghosts?” she asked. 



4 


“Believe in ghosts? No way!” Terri told her. 

I kept my mouth shut. I knew that ghosts weren’t supposed to be real. But 
what if all the scientists were wrong? 

There are so many ghost stories from all around the world, how can ghosts 
not be real? 

Maybe that’s why I sometimes get scared when I am in strange places. I 
think I do believe in ghosts. Of course, I would never admit this to Terri. She is 
always so scientific. She’d laugh at me forever! 

The three Sadler kids had clustered together. 

“Come on. Do you guys really believe in ghosts?” Terri asked. 

Louisa took a step forward. Sam tried to pull her back, but she brushed him 
off. “If you go near that cave, you might change your mind,” she said, narrowing 
her eyes. 

“You mean there are ghosts in there?” I asked. 

“What do they do? Come out at night or something?” 

Louisa started to reply, but Sam interrupted. “We’ve got to go now,” he 
said, scooting his brother and sister past us. 

“Hey—wait!” I called. “We want to hear about the ghosts!” 

They hurried on. I could see Sam yelling angrily at Louisa. I guess he was 
upset because she mentioned the ghosts. 

They disappeared down the beach. 

Then, from inside the cave we heard that long, low whistle again. 

Terri stared at me. 

“It’s the wind,” I said. I really didn’t believe that. Terri didn’t believe it, 
either. 

“Why don’t we ask Brad and Agatha about the cave?” I suggested. 

“Good idea,” Terri said. Even she looked a little scared now.. 

Brad and Agatha’s cottage was a short walk from the cave. It perched by 
itself on the edge of the pine forest, looking out toward the lighthouse. 

I ran up to the heavy wooden front door and pushed it open. I peered around 
the tiny front parlor. The old house creaked and groaned as I walked over the 
sagging floorboards. The ceiling hung so low, I could touch it when I stood on 



tiptoe. 

Terri came up beside me. “Are they here?” 

“I don’t think so,” I answered, looking around. 

We stepped past the old sofa and wide stone fireplace and into the cramped 
kitchen. Off the kitchen stood an old storeroom where I was to sleep. Upstairs 
was Brad and Agatha’s room with a “crawl-through” passage into the space 
above the storeroom, which would be Terri’s room. A tiny back staircase led 
from Terri’s room down to the yard. 

Terri turned to the window. “There they are!” she said. “In the garden!” 

I could see Brad bent over a tomato stalk. Agatha was hanging some clothes 
to dry on the clothesline. 

We raced out the kitchen door. “Where have you two been?” Agatha 
demanded. She and Brad both had white, white hair, and their eyes seemed faded 
and tired. They were so frail and light. Between them I don’t think they weighed 
more than a hundred pounds. 

“We explored the beach,” I told them. 

I knelt down beside Brad. He was missing the top part of two of his fingers 
on his left hand. He told us they got caught in a wolf trap when he was young. 

“We found an old cave in some huge rocks. Have you ever seen it?” I 
asked. 

He gave a little grunt and kept searching for ripe tomatoes. 

“It’s right by the beach and the big rock jetty,” Terri added. “You can’t miss 
it.” 

Agatha’s sheets fluttered on the line. “It’s nearly suppertime,” she said, 
ignoring our questions about the cave. “Why don’t you come inside and give me 
a hand, Terri?” 

Terri glanced at me and shrugged. 

I turned back to Brad. I was about to ask him about the cave again when he 
handed me the basket of ripe tomatoes. “Take these to Agatha, okay?” 

“Sure,” I answered, following Terri inside. I set the basket on the small 
counter. The kitchen was small and narrow. Counter and sink on one side. Stove 
and refrigerator on the other. Agatha had already put Terri to work in the corner 
of the living room, setting the table. 

“Now Terri, dear,” Agatha called from the kitchen, “if it’s asters you’re 
after, the best place to find those is in the big meadow down past the lighthouse. 
Of course they’re just coming out about now, so you can take your pick there. I 



believe that’s where you can find plenty of goldenrod, too.” 

“Great!” Terri called back with her usual enthusiasm. I don’t know how she 
could get so pumped about flowers. 

Agatha noticed the basket of tomatoes on the counter. “Oh, gracious! All 
those tomatoes!” She opened a rattley old drawer and pulled out a small knife. 
“Why don’t you cut these up for a big green salad?” 

I must have made a face. 

“Don’t you like salad?” Agatha asked. 

“Not really,” I said. “I mean, I’m not a rabbit!” 

Agatha laughed. “You’re absolutely right,” she said. “Why ruin a 
homegrown tomato with lettuce? We’ll have them plain, with maybe a little 
dressing.” 

“Sounds good,” I grinned, picking up the knife. 

I listened to Agatha and Terri discuss wildflowers for a few minutes to see 
if the subject of the cave would come up again. It didn’t. I wondered why my 
two old cousins didn’t want to talk about it. 

After dinner Brad pulled out an old deck of playing cards and taught Terri 
and me how to play whist. It’s an old-fashioned card game that I’d never heard 
of before. 

Brad got a kick out of teaching us the rules. He and I played against Terri 
and Agatha. Every time I got mixed up, which was most of the time, he’d wag 
his finger back and forth at me. I guess it saved him from having to say anything. 

We went to bed after the card game. It was early, but I didn’t care. It had 
been a long day, and I was glad to get some rest. The bed was hard, but I fell 
asleep as soon as my head hit the scratchy feather pillow. 

The next morning Terri and I made our way to the woods to collect plants and 
wildflowers. 

“What is it we’re looking for again?” I asked Terri as I kicked aside piles of 
dead leaves. 

“Indian pipe,” Terri replied. “It looks like small, pinkish-white bones 
popping out of the ground. It’s also called corpse plant because it lives on the 
remains of dead plants.” 

“Yuck.” I suddenly remembered the popping hands in my cemetery dream. 

Terri laughed. “You should like these plants,” she said. “They’re a scientific 
puzzle. They’re white because they don’t have any chlorophyll. You know. The 



stuff that makes plants turn green.” 

“How interesting,” I said sarcastically, rolling my eyes. 

Terri continued her lecture anyway. “Agatha said Indian pipe only grows in 
very dark places. They look more like a fungus than a plant.” 

She dug around for a few minutes. “The weirdest thing about them,” she 
continued, “is if they dry out, they turn black. That’s why I want to try pressing a 
few.” 

I poked around in the leaves some more. I have to admit she had me 
hooked. I love freaks of nature. 

I peered up at the heavy leaf canopy above us. “We’re definitely as deep 
into the woods as we can be. Are you sure this is where Agatha said you can find 
them?” 

Terri nodded. She pointed to a huge fallen oak tree. “That’s our landmark. 
Don’t lose it.” 

I started toward the big tree. “Maybe I’ll take a closer look over there,” I 
said. “There might be Indian pipe on that dead tree.” 

I knelt down by the snakelike tree roots and began carefully pushing dead 
leaves aside. No wildflowers. Just bugs and worms. It was really gross. 

I glanced back at Terri. She didn’t seem to be having any luck, either. 

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something white sticking out of 
the ground. I scurried over to examine it. 

A short plant stem stuck up from the soft ground. The stem was covered 
with rolled-up leaves. I tugged at the stem. It didn’t come up. 

I pulled harder. 

The stem rose up a little, bringing a clump of soft dirt with it. 

It isn’t a stem, I realized. It’s some kind of root. A root with leaves. 

Weird. 

I pulled more of it up from the ground. It was very long, I discovered. 

A hard tug. Then another. 

Another hard tug of the strange root brought up a huge mound of dirt. 

I glanced down into the large hole I had made—and uttered a sharp cry. 

“Terri—come here!” I managed to choke out. “I found a skeleton!” 



5 


“Huh?” Terri raced to my side. 

We both stood and stared down at it in silence. 

The skeleton I had uncovered lay curled on its side, every bone neatly in 
place. The empty eye socket in its gray skull gaped up at us. 

“Is it a h-human?” Terri stammered in a low whisper. 

“Not unless the human has four legs, genius!” I replied. 

Terri stared down at it, her mouth open in an O of surprise. “Well, then, 
what is it?” 

“Some kind of large animal,” I told her. “Maybe a deer.” 

I stooped to take a closer look. “No. Not a deer. It has toe bones, not 
hooves.” 

I studied the skull, which was fairly large and had sharp incisors or teeth. 
When I was nine, I had a thing about skeletons. I must have read every book 
ever written about skeletons. 

“My guess is a dog,” I announced. 

“A dog?” said Terri. “Oh, poor little doggy.” She stared at the skeleton. 
“How do you think it died?” 

“Maybe an animal attacked it.” 

Terri knelt down beside me. “Why would anyone want to eat a dog?” 

“They’re high in protein!” I joked. 

She shoved me hard. “Jerry! I’m serious. What animal around here eats 
dogs?” 

“A wolf maybe. Or a fox,” I replied thoughtfully. 

“Wouldn’t a wolf or fox have crunched a few of the bones and left more of 
a mess?” Terri asked. “This skeleton is in perfect shape.” 

“Maybe it died of old age,” I suggested. “Or maybe someone buried it here 
beneath that weird root plant.” 

“Yeah. Maybe it wasn’t attacked by anything,” Terri said. I could see the 
color returning to her face. 

We sat silently over the skeleton for a minute, thinking about the dog. 

A shrill animal howl made us both jump to our feet. The frightening sound 



filled the forest, echoing through the trees. 

We held our ears as the howling grew louder. “Wh-what is it? What’s 
making that horrible cry?” Terri shrieked. I stared back at her. I didn’t know. I 
only knew it was moving closer. 



6 


The howls stopped as suddenly as they started. 

When I turned around to make sure we were safe, I saw them. 

Sam, Nat, and Louisa were huddled behind a nearby tree. Laughing. 

I glared at them. I realized instantly that they had been making the howls. 
Who did they think they were? 

It took them a long time to stop laughing. I couldn’t believe how much they 
were enjoying their little joke. 

I glanced at Terri. She was blushing. My face felt hot. I guess I was 
blushing, too. 

When they finally stopped laughing, I invited them over to see the skeleton. 

Now it was their turn to be startled. 

Sam’s eyes grew wide. Louisa let out a short cry. Nat, the little one, grabbed 
on to his sister’s sleeve and started to whimper. 

Terri dug into her jeans pockets for a tissue. “Don’t worry,” she told Nat. 
She dabbed at his cheeks with her tissue. “It’s not a person skeleton. It’s only a 
dog skeleton.” 

Those words made Nat burst into tears. 

Louisa put her arms around Nat’s trembling shoulders. “Shush,” she said. 
“It’s all right.” 

But Nat couldn’t calm himself down. “I know what happened to this dog,” 
he sobbed. “A ghost killed it. Dogs can tell if someone’s a ghost. Dogs always 
bark to warn about ghosts.” 

“Nat,” Terri said softly, “there’s no such thing as ghosts. They’re pretend.” 

Sam stepped forward, shaking his head. “You’re wrong,” he told Terri, 
narrowing his eyes at her. “There are lots of skeletons in these woods. All 
because of the ghost. He picks the bones clean and leaves them lying here.” 

“Give me a break, Sam,” Terri muttered. “Are you trying to tell us that 
there’s a ghost around here?” 

Sam stared back, but didn’t reply. 

“Well, are you?” Terri demanded. 

Suddenly Sam’s expression changed. His eyes grew wide with terror. 
“There it is!” he cried, pointing. “Right behind you!” 



7 


I let out a shriek and grabbed Terri’s arm. 

But I knew immediately that I’d been fooled again. When was I going to 
stop falling for Sam’s dumb jokes? 

“You two are too easy to scare,” Sam said, grinning. 

Terri put her hands on her hips and glared at Sam. “How about a truce, 
guys? These jokes are getting pretty lame.” 

All eyes were on Sam. 

“Yeah. Okay. A truce,” he murmured. But he had a grin on his face. I 
couldn’t tell if he meant it or not. 

“Sam, tell Jerry and me more about the ghost,” Terri demanded. “Were you 
serious about a ghost killing the dog, or was that one of your fabulous jokes?” 

Sam kicked at a clump of dirt. “Maybe some other time,” he muttered. 

“Some other time? Why not now?” I asked. 

Louisa started to say something—but Sam tugged her away. “Let’s go,” he 
said sharply. “Now.” 

Terri’s expression changed to confusion. “But I thought—” 

Sam stalked off through the trees, dragging Louisa with him. Nat hurried to 
catch up to them. 

“Bye,” Louisa called. “See you later.” 

“Did you see that?” Terri cried. “They really do believe there’s a ghost in 
these woods. They didn’t want to talk about it, so they left.” 

I stared down at the animal skeleton, lying so clean and perfect on the 
ground. 

Picked clean. 

Picked clean by a ghost. 

The words rolled through my mind. 

I stared hard at the jagged teeth in the pale skull. Then I turned away. 

“Let’s go back to the cottage,” I murmured. 

We found Brad and Agatha sitting in rocking chairs under a shady tree. Agatha 
was slicing peaches into a large wooden bowl, and Brad watched her. 



“Do you two like peach pie?” Agatha asked. 

Terri and I replied that it was one of our favorites. 

Agatha smiled. “We’ll have it tonight. I don’t know if your dad mentioned 
it, but peach pie is one of my specialties. So did you find the Indian pipe?” 

“Not exactly,” I replied. “We found a dog skeleton instead.” 

Agatha began slicing more quickly, the knife blade slipping over her thumb 
as the soft peach slices slid into the bowl. “Oh, my,” she muttered. 

“What kind of an animal would go after a dog?” asked Terri. “Are there 
wolves or coyotes around here?” 

“Never seen any,” Brad answered quickly. 

“Then how do you explain that skeleton?” I demanded. “It was perfectly 
arranged, and the bones were picked clean.” 

Agatha and Brad exchanged a worried glance. “Can’t say as I know,” said 
Agatha. Slice. Slice. Slice. “Brad? Do you have any ideas?” 

Brad rocked back and forth for a minute. “Nope.” 

Very helpful, Brad, I thought. 

“We also met three kids,” I said. I told them about Sam, Nat, and Louisa. 
“They said they know you.” 

“Yep,” Brad replied. “Neighbors.” 

“They told us a ghost must have killed the dog.” 

Agatha set down her paring knife and leaned her head back against the 
chair, laughing softly to herself. “Is that what they said? Oh, my. Those kids 
were teasing you. They love to make up ghost stories. Especially that oldest boy, 
Sam.” 

“That’s what I thought,” Terri said, glancing at me. 

Agatha nodded. “They’re nice kids. You should invite them to do 
something with you some time. Maybe you can all go blueberry picking.” 

Brad cleared his throat. His pale eyes studied me. “You’re too smart to fall 
for ghost stories, aren’t you?” 

“Yeah. I guess,” I replied uncertainly. 

We spent the rest of the afternoon helping Brad weed the garden. Weeding isn’t 
exactly my idea of a thrill. But after Brad showed us which were the good plants 
and which weren’t, Terri and I had fun spearing the bad guys with the special 
weeding tools he lent us. 

We ate the peach pie for dessert that night, and it was delicious. Agatha and 



Brad wanted to hear all about our school and our friends. 

After dinner, Brad challenged us to another game of whist. This time I did 
much better. Brad only had to wiggle his finger at me a couple of times. 

Later, I had a tough time falling asleep. The window of my little room off 
the kitchen had long, flimsy, white cotton curtains that allowed the light of the 
full moon to shine onto my face. It felt like staring into a flashlight. 

I tried covering my face with the pillow, but I couldn’t breathe. Then I tried 
resting my arm over my eyes, but my arm quickly fell asleep. 

I pulled the sheet up over my head. Better. 

I closed my eyes. The crickets were making a real racket. 

Then I heard something thump against the wall outside. Probably a tree 
branch, I told myself. 

Another thump. I slid a little further down in my bed. 

The third time I heard the sound, I took a deep breath, sat up, and tossed off 
the sheet. 

I took a careful look around the room. Nothing. Nada. Zip. 

I lay back down. 

Near the doorway, the floorboards creaked. 

I turned to the window. 

Behind the curtains, something moved. 

Something pale. Ghostly. 

The floorboards creaked again as the pale figure moved toward me.

I opened my mouth in a low, terrified scream. Then I pulled the sheet back over 
my head. 

The room grew silent. I was trembling all over. 

Where was the ghost? 

I peeked out from the sheet. 

Terri stepped out from behind the curtain. “Gotcha,” she whispered. 

“You creep,” I choked out. “How could you do that to me?” 

“Easy,” she replied, grinning. “All this ghost talk has you freaked out— 
hasn’t it.” 

I let out an angry growl, but didn’t reply. My heart was still thudding in my 
chest. 

Terri sat down on the edge of the bed. She pulled her robe around her more 
tightly. “I just couldn’t resist,” she said, still grinning. “I came down to talk to 
you, and I saw you lying there with the sheet over your head. It was too 
tempting.” 

I glared at her. “Next time pick on someone your own size,” I said angrily. 
“I had the sheet pulled up because I was having trouble falling asleep.” 

“Me, too,” Terri said. “My mattress is really lumpy.” She stared out the 
window. “And, besides, I was thinking about that ghost.” 

“Hey—you’re the one who doesn’t believe in them—remember?” I 
insisted. 

“I know. I really don’t believe in ghosts. But Sam, Louisa, and Nat 
obviously do.” 

“So?” 

“So I want to find out why. Don’t you?” 

“Not really. I don’t care if I ever see those kids again,” I said. 

Terri yawned. “Louisa seems nice. Much more friendly than Sam. I think 
we can get Louisa to tell us more about the ghost if we ask her. She almost told 
us today.” 

“Terri, I don’t believe you,” I replied, pulling the sheet up to my chin. “You 
heard what Agatha said. Sam likes to make up stories.” 

“I don’t think this is a story,” Terri said. “I know I’m supposed to be the 



scientific one in the family. But I think something strange is going on here, 
Jerry.” 

I didn’t answer. I was picturing the animal skeleton. 

“I’m going to ask them about the ghost again tomorrow,” Terri announced. 

“How do you know they’ll show up?” 

Terri grinned. “They always do, don’t they? Haven’t you noticed? No 
matter where we are, they always seem to be there.” She paused. “Do you think 
they’re following us?” 

“I hope not,” I said. 

Terri laughed. “You’re such a wimp.” 

I threw off the covers. “Am not!” 

Terri started tickling me. “Wimp! Wimp! Wimp!” 

I grabbed her arm and twisted it behind her. Then I started tickling her back. 
“Take it back,” I said. 

“Okay, okay!” she cried. “I didn’t mean it.” 

“And you’ll never call me a wimp again?” 

“Never!” 

As soon as I let go of her arm, she ran to the doorway. “See you in the 
morning—wimp!” she called. She disappeared through the kitchen. 

At breakfast the next morning, Agatha asked, “What do you kids have planned 
for today?” 

“A swim, I guess,” I replied, glancing at Terri. “Down at the beach.” 

“Be careful of the tide down there,” Brad warned. “It can sweep a full- 
grown man off his feet.” 

Terri and I glanced at each other. I don’t think we’d ever heard Brad put 
two full sentences together before. 

“We will,” Terri promised. “We’ll probably do more wading than 
swimming.” 

Agatha handed me a banged-up metal pail. “Might want to pick up some 
sea urchins or sea stars.” 

A few minutes later, I took the pail and a couple of old beach towels, and 
Terri and I headed down the twisty path along the shoreline. 

We scrambled up and down the rocks until we came to a spot not far from 
the sandy beach and the cave. 

We slid down the giant rock underneath us and then climbed on all fours 



across a few smaller rocks until we reached a wide, mossy, tide pool about three 
feet from the water’s edge. The tide pool was about the size of a kiddie pool. 

“Wow, Jerry!” Terri exclaimed, staring into the water. “I see tons of stuff in 
here.” She reached into the green, slimy water and pulled out a sea star. “It’s so 
tiny. Not even the size of my palm. Maybe it’s a baby.” 

She turned it over. Its legs wiggled. “Hello, cute little sea star,” she sang. 

Yuck. “I’ll go get the pail, okay?” I said. I climbed back over the rocks to 
where we left our things. 

Guess who was bent over our stuff? Snooping. “Find anything good?” I 
called sharply. 

Sam glanced up slowly. “I was wondering whose towels these were,” he 
said casually. 

Nat and Louisa came bounding over the rocks. “Where’s Terri?” Louisa 
asked. 

I motioned toward the water. “Down by the tide pool.” I grabbed the pail. 

They followed me back down. Terri smiled when she saw us. I could tell 
she was happy to see Louisa and her brothers. “Look at all the cool stuff I found 
in here,” Terri declared. 

Along the smooth surface of a large, flat rock she lined up the baby sea star, 
two sea urchins, and a hermit crab. 

We crowded together to see. Terri held out the sea star. “Aren’t its feet 
cute?” she asked Nat. 

He giggled. 

We spent a few minutes examining everything. Nat started rattling off 
everything he’d ever learned about crabs. Louisa finally had to cut him off. 

“I want to hear more about the ghost,” Terri told Louisa. 

“Nothing more to tell,” Louisa replied softly. She glanced nervously at 

Sam. 

Had he warned her not to talk about it anymore? 

Terri refused to give up. “Where does the ghost live?” she demanded. 

Louisa and Sam exchanged glances again. 

“Come on, guys. It has to live somewhere!” Terri teased. 

Nat gazed toward the beach and the cave. A breeze fluttered his fine, blond 
hair. He slapped a green fly on his skinny bare arm. 

“Does the ghost live on the beach?” Terri asked. 

Nat shook his head. 



“In the cave?” I guessed. 

Nat pinched his lips together. 

“I thought so,” Terri said. “In the cave.” She flashed me a triumphant grin. 
“What else?” 

Nat’s face turned red. He hid behind Louisa. “I didn’t mean to tell,” he 
whispered. 

“It’s okay,” Louisa told him, petting his hair. She turned to Terri and me. 
“The ghost is very old. No one has ever seen him come out.” 

“Louisa!” Sam said sharply. “I really don’t think we should talk about this.” 

“Why not?” Louisa shot back. “They have a right to know.” 

“But they don’t even believe in ghosts,” Sam insisted. 

“Well, maybe you can change my mind,” Terri replied. “Are you guys sure 
there’s a ghost? Have you really seen it?” 

“We’ve seen the skeletons,” Louisa said solemnly. 

Nat peeked his head out from behind Louisa’s leg. “The ghost comes out 
during the full moon,” he announced. 

“We don’t know that for sure,” Louisa corrected. “He’s been in the cave up 
there forever. Some people say for three hundred years.” 

“But if you haven’t seen him,” I said, “how do you know he’s in the cave?” 

“You can see a light flickering,” Sam replied. 

“Alight?” I hooted. “Give me a break! That could be anything. It could be a 
guy in there with a flashlight.” 

Louisa shook her head. “It’s not that kind of light,” she insisted. “It’s 
different from that.” 

“Well, a flickering light and a dog skeleton aren’t enough to convince me,” 
I said. “I think you’re just trying to scare us again. This time, I’m not falling for 
it.” 

Sam scowled. “No problem,” he muttered. “You don’t have to believe it. 
Really.” 

“Well, I don’t,” I insisted. 

Sam shrugged. “Have fun,” he said softly. He led his brother and sister back 
toward the woods. 

As soon as they were out of sight, Terri punched me in the side. “Jerry, why 
did you do that? I was just starting to weasel some good stuff out of them.” 

I shook my head. “Can’t you see they’re trying to scare us? There’s no 
ghost. It’s another dumb joke.” 



Terri stared hard at me. “I’m not so sure,” she murmured. 

I gazed up at the enormous black hole of the cave. Despite the morning 
heat, a chill ran down my back. 

Was there an ancient ghost in there? 

Did I really want to find out? 

Agatha made a really great old-fashioned chicken pot pie for dinner. I ate all of 
mine except for the peas and carrots. I’m not into vegetables. 

Terri and I were helping Agatha with the dishes after dinner when she said, 
“Jerry, I seem to be missing one of the beach towels. Didn’t you take two with 
you this morning?” 

“I guess we did,” I replied. 

“Did we leave one at the beach?” Terri asked. 

I tried to remember. “I don’t think so. I can go take a look.” 

“Don’t bother,” Agatha said. “It’s getting dark out. You can look 
tomorrow.” 

“I don’t mind,” I told her. I threw down my dish towel and bolted out the 
back door before she could say anything else. 

I was glad for an excuse to escape. That tiny kitchen was suffocating me. 
There was hardly any room to turn around in there. 

I walked along the path to the water’s edge, happy to be alone for a change. 
Terri is okay, especially for a kid sister. We get along amazingly well. But 
sometimes I like to be by myself. 

I found the big rock where we’d left our towels that morning. No sign of the 
missing towel. Maybe Sam took it, I thought. Maybe he planned to drape it over 
his head and jump out at us. 

I gazed up at the big cave, dark against the blue-black sky. 

“Huh?” 

I blinked—and took a step closer. 

Was that a light flickering in the cave? 

I took another step. It had to be the reflection of the moon, just rising over 
the pine trees. 

No. Not the moon, I realized. 

I took another few steps. I couldn’t take my eyes off the flickering light, so 
pale, so ghostly pale, in the black cave opening. 

Sam! I told myself. Yes, it’s Sam. He’s up there right now, lighting matches. 



Hoping I’ll fall for his trick. 

Should I climb up there? 

My sneakers sank into the sand as I took a few more steps toward the cave. 
The light glimmered in the cave opening. It hovered so near the entrance. 
Floating. Flickering. Dancing slowly. 

Should I go up there? I asked myself. 

Should I? 



9 


Yes. I had to climb up there. 

The light glimmered brighter, as if calling to me. 

I took a deep breath, then jumped across a tide pool and over some mossy 
rocks. Then I started up. 

The cave stood high above me, embedded in the boulders. I leaped and 
scrambled over slippery, small rocks until I reached the next big boulder. 

A halo of yellow moonlight shone down on the rocks, making it easy to see. 
What was it Nat said about the moon? Something about the ghost coming out 
when it was full? 

I scaled the next rock, and kept climbing. 

I could see the ghostly light floating above me in the cave entrance. 

Up, up I climbed over the scraggly rocks, slippery from the evening dew. 

“Oh!” I cried out as I felt my legs give way. A mini-landslide had started 
under my feet. Small rocks and sand tumbled down the hill behind me. 

Desperately, I grabbed at a fat root growing out between the rocks. I held on 
long enough to get my footing. 

Whew! I took a moment to catch my breath. 

Then I pulled myself up onto a sturdy boulder and gazed up to the cave. 
Now it was right above my head. Only another ten feet or so to go. 

I stood up—and gasped. 

Whoa! What was that noise behind me? 

I stood frozen. Waiting. Listening. 

Was someone else there? 

Was the ghost there? 

I didn’t have long to wonder. A cold, clammy hand grabbed my neck. 



10 


I uttered a choking sound and struggled to turn around. 

The cold fingers relaxed their grip. “Ssssh,” Terri whispered. “It’s me.” 

I let out an angry growl. “What do you think you’re doing?” 

“Never mind that,” she shot back. “What do you think you ’re doing?” 

“I—I’m looking for that beach towel,” I stammered. 

Terri laughed. “You’re looking for a ghost, Jerry. Admit it.” 

We both raised our eyes to the cave. “Do you see the light?” I whispered. 
“Huh? What light?” Terri demanded. 

“The light flickering in the cave,” I replied impatiently. “What’s wrong with 
you? Do you need glasses?” 

“I’m sorry. I don’t see any light,” Terri insisted. “It’s completely dark.” 

I stared up at the cave opening. Stared up into total darkness. 

She was right. The flickering light in the cave had vanished. 

As I lay in bed later that night, I tried to use what Mr. Hendrickson, my science 
teacher, calls my “critical thinking skills.” That’s when you have to put together 
whatever facts you have and those you don’t, and then draw a logical conclusion. 
So I asked myself: What do I know? 

I know I saw a light. Then the light went out. 

So what was the explanation? An optical illusion? My imagination? Sam? 
Outside the window, a dog began to bark. 

That’s weird, I thought. I hadn’t seen any dogs around here before. 

I stuffed my pillow over my ears. 

The barking grew louder, more emotional. It sounded as if it were right 
outside my window. 

I sat up, listening. 

And remembered what Nat had told us. Dogs recognize ghosts. 

Was that why the dog was barking so excitedly? 

Had the dog spotted the ghost? 

With a shiver, I climbed out of bed and crept to the window. 

I peered down to the ground. 



No dog. 

I listened. 

The barking had stopped. 

Crickets chirped. The trees whispered. 

“Here, doggy,” I called softly. 

No reply. I shivered again. 

Silence now. 

What’s going on here? I wondered. 

“Sssshhh. YouTl scare them,” Terri whispered. 

The morning sun was still a red ball, low in the sky, as we approached the 
seagull nest Terri had spotted the day before. 

Bird-watching was Terri Sadler Hobby Number Three. Unlike gravestone 
mbbings and wild-flower collecting, she could do this one back at home, right 
from our apartment window. 

We crouched down to watch. About fifteen feet away, the mother seagull 
was trying to herd her three babies back into the nest. She squawked noisily and 
chased them first in one direction, then another. 

“Aren’t the babies cute?” whispered Terri. “They look like fuzzy gray 
stuffed animals, don’t they?” 

“Actually they remind me of rats,” I replied. 

Terri poked me with her elbow. “Don’t be a creep.” 

We watched them in silence for a few minutes. “So tell me again about the 
dog barking last night,” Terri asked. “I can’t believe I didn’t hear it.” 

“There’s nothing more to tell,” I replied edgily. “When I went to the 
window, it stopped.” 

Down the beach I saw the three Sadler kids, in shorts and sleeveless T- 
shirts, walking barefoot along the shore. I jumped up and started jogging toward 
them. 

“What’s your hurry?” Terri called after me. 

“I want to tell them about the flickering light,” I called back. 

“Wait up!” Terri shouted, scrambling after me. 

We stumbled along the rocky beach toward the three kids. I saw that Sam 
was carrying a couple of old fishing poles, and Louisa had a bucket filled with 
water. 

“Hi,” Louisa said warmly, setting down the bucket. 



“Catch anything?” I asked. 

“Nope,” Nat replied. “We didn’t go fishing yet.” 

“What’s in the bucket, then?” I asked. 

Nat reached in and pulled out a small, silver fish. “Bunker. We use ’em for 
bait.” 

I leaned down and peered into the pail. Dozens of little silver-gray fish 
swarmed around inside. “Wow.” 

“Want to come?” Louisa asked. 

Terri and I traded glances. Fishing sounded like fun. And maybe it would 
give us a chance to ask casually about the light in the cave. “Sure,” I said. “Why 
not?” 

We followed them down the sandy path to a shady spot on the water. “We 
usually have good luck here,” Sam announced. 

He grabbed a bait fish out of the bucket, then steadied his fishing pole 
against his leg. He expertly threaded the fish onto the hook, then handed me the 
pole. The fish flipped back and forth on the hook. 

“Want to try?” he asked. I wondered why he was suddenly acting so nice to 
me now. Had Louisa gotten on his case? Or was he setting me up for another 
joke? 

“Sure, I’ll try,” I told him. “What do I do?” 

Sam showed me how to cast the line out. My first try wasn’t great. The line 
landed about a foot from the shore. 

Sam laughed and cast it for me again. “Don’t worry,” he said, handing the 
pole back to me. “It takes a lot of practice to learn to cast.” 

This Sam was certainly different from the Sam we had seen before. Maybe 
it just takes him a while to get friendly, I told myself. 

“Now what do I do?” I asked him. 

“Keep casting out and reeling in,” he said. “And if you feel a tug, yell.” 

Sam turned to Terri. “Do you want to try, too?” he asked. 

“Of course!” she replied. 

Sam started to grab a bunker for Terri from the bucket. 

“That’s okay,” Terri said. “I can do it.” 

Sam stepped back and let Terri do the honors. I think she must have been 
showing off. I’d never seen her bait a live fish before. She always hated slimy 
things. 

Terri started to cast out her line without any help. I was about to accuse her 



again of showing off. But then her fishing line got tangled in the tree branches 
above us. 

That got everyone laughing—especially when the bait fish squirmed off the 
hook and dropped down into Terri’s hair. Terri shrieked, thrashed her arms, and 
swatted the fish into the water. 

Sam collapsed with laughter on the rock. The rest of us laughed, too. We 
were all sprawled out on a big flat rock. 

This seemed a good time to bring up the cave. “Guess what?” I started. 
“Last night I came down to the beach, and I saw that flickering light you were 
talking about in the cave.” 

Sam’s smile faded instantly. “You did?” 

Louisa’s eyes grew wide with concern. “You... you didn’t go in there, did 
you? Please say no.” 

“No, I didn’t go inside,” I told them. 

“It’s really dangerous,” Louisa said. “You shouldn’t climb up there. Really.” 

“Yeah. Really,” Sam quickly agreed. His eyes burned into mine. 

I glanced at Terri. I could tell what she was thinking. These three kids really 
were frightened. They didn’t want to admit it. They didn’t want to talk about it. 

But they were terrified of the cave. 

Why? 

I only knew one thing for sure: I had to find out. 



11 


At dinner, we sat at the round table in the living room off the kitchen. Brad was 
tackling a piece of corn on the cob with his knife, trying to saw off all the little 
niblets so he could eat them with a fork. 

“Brad... uh... I was wondering about the cave,” I started, fiddling with my 
silverware. 

I felt Terri’s foot nudge mine under the table. 

“What about it?” Brad asked. 

“Well... uh... the strangest thing...” I hesitated. 

Agatha’s head turned sharply. “You didn’t go into that cave, did you?” 

“No,” I replied. 

“You really shouldn’t go into the cave,” she warned. “It isn’t safe.” 

“Well, that’s what I wanted to talk about,” I continued. I saw that everyone 
had stopped eating. “Last night when I went to look for the beach towel, there 
was a light flickering inside the cave. Do you know what it was?” 

Brad narrowed his eyes at me. “Just an optical illusion,” he said curtly. 
Then he picked up his corn and began sawing again. 

“I don’t understand,” I told him. “What do you mean?” 

Brad patiently put down his corn. “Jerry, did you ever hear of the northern 
lights? Aurora borealis?” 

“Sure,” I said. “But...” 

“That’s what that flickering light was,” he said, cutting me off. He picked 
up his corn again. 

“Oh,” I replied. I turned to Agatha, hoping she’d help fill in the blanks. She 
did. 

“It happens at certain times of the year,” she explained. “Something electric 
gets in the air. The whole sky lights up in streamers.” 

She reached for the bowl of mashed potatoes. “More potatoes?” 

“Sure, thanks.” I felt Terri’s foot bump me again from across the table. I 
shook my head at her. Brad and Agatha were wrong. That couldn’t have been the 
northern lights. The light was coming from the cave, not the sky. 

Were they mistaken? 

Or were they deliberately lying to me? 



* * * 


After dinner, Terri and I walked along the beach. Wisps of gray clouds floated 
over the full moon. Shadows stretched and shifted in front of us as we made our 
way over the pebbly sand. 

“They lied to me,” I insisted to Terri, my hands shoved deep into the 
pockets of my cutoffs. “Brad and Agatha are hiding something. They don’t want 
us to know the truth about the cave.” 

“They’re just worried,” my sister replied. “They don’t want us to get hurt 
up there. They feel responsible, and—” 

“Terri, look—!” I cried. I pointed up to the cave. 

This time Terri saw the flickering light, too. 

As we watched it floating above our heads in the cave entrance, the clouds 
covered the moon and the sky darkened. 

“It’s not the northern lights,” I whispered. “There’s someone up there.” 

“Let’s check it out,” Terri whispered back. 

Before we even realized what we were doing, we were climbing the rocks, 
pulling ourselves up toward the cave. It felt as if I were being pulled by a 
magnet. 

I had to get closer, close enough to see what was causing that strange, 
floating light. 

Behind us, the ocean waves crashed against the lowest rocks, spraying surf 
in every direction. 

We were almost to the mouth of the cave. I glanced back and saw that the 
beach lay far below. In the cave mouth, the light still flickered and floated. 

We pulled ourselves up the last few rocks and stood up. 

We found ourselves standing on a wide ledge. The dark cave loomed up 
ahead, towering over us. 

I peered into the cave opening. How deep was the cave? I couldn’t tell. 

Squinting into the dim light, I thought I saw a tunnel leading off to one side. 

I took a step closer. Terri moved up close beside me. I could see the fear on 
her face. She bit her lower lip. “Well?” she asked in a hushed whisper. 

“Let’s go in,” I said. 



12 


My heart thudded as we stepped into the darkness. Our sneakers slid on the 
smooth, damp cave floor. I nearly choked on the sour, musty smell. 

“Hey—!” I cried out as Terri grabbed my arm. 

“The light—look!” she whispered. 

It flickered near the back of the cave. 

Staying close together, we took a few steps toward it. Our sneakers 
squished loudly. The air grew warmer. 

“It—it’s a tunnel,” I stammered. 

The cave narrowed, then curved away. The dim light flickered from around 
the corner, from somewhere deeper in the cave. 

I swallowed hard. “Let’s just go a little farther,” I urged. 

Terri lingered behind me. “That tunnel looks creepy,” she uttered in a tiny 
voice. 

I heard a soft cluttering sound somewhere up ahead. 

“We’ve come this far,” I urged. “Might as well go just a little bit farther.” 

Following the light, we lowered our heads and stepped into the tunnel. I 
could hear the drip drip drip of water nearby. The air grew even warmer, steamy. 

The tunnel curved, then suddenly widened into a deep, round chamber. 

I stopped as I heard the cluttering sound again. A soft flapping, fluttering 
sound. Growing louder. 

“What’s that noise?” Terri cried. Her shrill voice echoed against the cave 
walls. 

Before I could answer, the fluttering became a deafening clatter. 

“Nooooo!” My cry was drowned out by the horrifying roar. 

I raised my eyes in time to see the black cave ceiling crumble and fall over 
us. 



13 


“Noooooo!” 

I was still wailing as I hit the wet cave floor. I covered my head with both 
hands. 

And waited. Waited for the crashing pain. 

The clatter swirled over me. A shrill whistle rose up over the sound. 

My heart thudding, I raised my eyes—and saw the bats. 

Thousands of black bats, flapping and fluttering, swooping back and forth 
across the chamber, darting low, then twisting away. 

The ceiling hadn’t fallen. 

By entering their chamber, Terri and I had awakened the bats. They 
whistled and hissed as they swooped wildly over our heads. 

“L-let’s get out of here!” I cried, helping Terri to her feet. “I hate bats!” 

“This is why Brad and Agatha warned us away,” Terri cried, shouting over 
the roar of fluttering wings. 

We both turned to leave. But the flickering light at the far end of the 
chamber made me stop. 

Just a few feet farther. If we made our way a few feet deeper into the 
chamber, we could solve the mystery. 

And never have to think about this frightening cave again. 

“Come on,” I shouted. I grabbed Terri’s hand and tugged. 

The bats swooped and darted over our heads, cluttering and whistling. We 
ducked our heads as we ran under them. 

To the back wall of the chamber. Into another narrow, curving tunnel. I 
pressed my back against the tunnel wall and edged forward, still holding Terri’s 
hand. 

The pale light grew brighter. 

We were getting close. 

The tunnel opened into another large chamber, about the same size as the 
first chamber. Terri and I had to shield our eyes. The entrance glowed with a 
bright, flickering light. 

I took a few slow steps in, giving my eyes a chance to adjust to the light. 



Then I saw them. 

Candles. Dozens of short white candles perched around the chamber on 
rock ledges. 

All of them lighted. All of them flickering. 

“So that explains it,” I whispered. “Flickering candlelight.” 

“It doesn’t explain anything!” Terri protested, shadows dancing over her 
pale face. “Who put the candles here?” 

We both saw the man at the same time. 

An old man with long, stringy, white hair and a beaklike nose. He sat 
hunched over a crude table made from a log of driftwood. 

Pale and terribly thin, his worn shirt hung loosely on him. His eyes were 
closed. Shadows played over him. He seemed to flicker in and out with the 
candlelight. 

As if he were part of the light. 

Part of the ghostly light. 

Terri and I froze, staring at him. Did he see us? Was he alive? 

Was he a ghost? 

His eyes opened. Large, dark eyes sunk deep in their sockets. 

He turned to us, stared back at us with those frightening sunken eyes. 

Slowly he curled a bony, gnarled finger. “Come here.” His voice was a dry 
whisper. Dry as death. 

And before we could move, he rose up from the chair and began to come 
for us. 



14 


I wanted to run. But my feet felt glued to the floor. 

As if the ghostly figure were holding me there, keeping me from escaping. 

Terri let out a low cry. She bumped me from behind. 

I think she had stumbled. But her bump got us both moving. 

I took one last glance back at the pale, flickering figure. His bony frame 
shimmered in the eerie candlelight. 

He started toward us, his mouth twisted into a strange grin. The dark eyes 
gazed at us blankly, like black buttons on a snowman. 

Then we turned and ran. 

Terri sprinted ahead of me through the tunnel, her sneakers slapping the wet 
floor. Slipping and stumbling, I struggled to keep up with her. 

My legs felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds. The blood pulsed so 
hard at my temples, I thought my head might explode. 

“Go! Go! Go!” I shouted all the way. 

I turned and glanced back. 

He was coming after us! 

“Noooo!” I screamed. 

I shouldn’t have turned back. 

I stumbled over a jagged rock—and went sprawling on the hard floor. 

I landed hard on my elbows and knees. 

Gasping for breath, I spun around. 

In time to see the ghost’s bony hands reach out for my throat. 



15 


I let out a terrified howl, scrambled to my feet, and lurched away from his bony, 
outstretched hands. 

A few feet up ahead, Terri watched in horror, her mouth open, her eyes 
wide with fright. 

I heard the ghost groan as he reached out with both arms. 

Somehow I found the strength to run. 

Terri and I were both running now. Through the narrow, curving tunnel. 
Through the bat chamber, silent and empty now. 

To the mouth of the cave. 

And then we were slipping and sliding, scrambling down the dew-wet 
boulders. Down, down to the rocky, moonlit beach. 

I turned back once. I couldn’t help it. 

The cave opening was dark now, I saw. Darker than the night sky. 

We ran along the shore, then turned into the woods. We were both breathing 
hard, panting loudly as we reached the cottage. 

I pushed open the door, stumbled in after Terri, then slammed it hard behind 
us. 

“Terri? Jerry? Is that you?” Agatha’s voice floated from the kitchen. She 
came in, wiping her hands on a checkered dish towel. “Well?” she demanded. 
“Did you find it?” 

“Huh?” I gaped at her, still struggling to catch my breath. 

Did we find the ghost? 

Is that what Agatha was asking? 

“Did you find it?” Agatha repeated. “Did you find the beach towel?” 

She stared at us in bewilderment as Terri and I burst out in relieved 
laughter. 

I couldn’t get to sleep that night. I kept picturing the ghost. His stringy, white 
hair. His sunken eyes. His bony fingers reaching out for me. 

And I kept wondering if Terri and I had done the right thing by not telling 
Agatha and Brad about him. 

“We’ll only get in trouble for going into the cave,” I had told my sister. 



“They probably won’t believe us anyway,” Terri added. 

“And why should we get them upset?” I said. 

“They’ve been so nice to us. And we went into the cave when they told us 
not to.” 

So we hadn’t told them about the frightening ghost surrounded by candles 
in the creepy cave. 

And now as I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind tossed and turned, 
too. And I wondered if Terri and I should confess to our cousins what we had 
done and seen. 

Despite the summer heat, I pulled the covers up to my chin and stared at the 
window. Behind the billowing curtains, pale white moonlight shimmered 
brightly. 

The moonlight didn’t cheer me. It reminded me of the ghost’s pale skin. 

Suddenly, my troubled thoughts were interrupted by a soft tapping. 

Tap tap. Tap tap tap. 

I sat up quickly. 

The sound was repeated. Tap tap. Tap tap tap. 

And then I heard a ghostly whisper: “Come here. ” 

Tap tap tap. 

“Come here. ” 

And I knew that the ghost had followed me home. 



16 


“Come here. ” 

Sitting up in bed, rigid with fear, I stared helplessly as a face rose up in the 
moonlit window. 

First I saw a pale tuft of hair. Then a broad forehead. A pair of dark eyes, 
gleaming blue in the bright light. 

Nat! 

He grinned at me through the window. 

“Nat! It’s you!” I cried gratefully, jumping out of bed, pulling my robe over 
my pajamas, and lurching to the open window. 

He giggled. 

I peered out. Sam had Nat on his shoulders and was lowering him to the 
ground. Louisa, in white tennis shorts and a loose-fitting gray sweater, stood 
beside them. 

“Wh-what are you guys doing out here?” I stammered. “You scared me to 
death.” 

“We weren’t trying to scare you,” Sam replied, his hands on Nat’s slender 
shoulders. “We saw you and your sister running on the beach. We wondered 
what happened.” 

“You won’t believe it!” I exclaimed. 

I realized that my voice was probably carrying up to Brad and Agatha’s 
room. I didn’t want to wake them. 

I motioned to the three kids. “Come into my room. We can talk in here.” 

Sam lifted Nat up to the windowsill. I pulled him in. Then the other two 
climbed in after him. 

They sat down on the bed. I paced excitedly in front of them. 

“Terri and I went into the cave,” I told them in a low voice. “We saw the 
ghost. He was sitting in a back chamber filled with candles.” 

All three of them showed surprise on their faces. 

“He was very old and scary-looking,” I continued. “He didn’t walk. He kind 
of floated. When he saw us, he started to chase us. I fell, and he nearly grabbed 
me. But I got away.” 

“Wow,” Sam muttered. The other two continued to stare at me in 



amazement. 

“Then what?” Nat asked. 

“Then we ran back here as fast as we could,” I told him. “That’s it.” 

They stared at me for a long moment. I tried to figure out what they were 
thinking. Did they believe me? 

Finally, Sam climbed off the bed and walked to the window. “We didn’t 
want you to know about the ghost,” he said softly, tossing back his brown hair. 

“Why not?” I demanded. 

Sam hesitated. “We didn’t want to scare you.” 

I let out a scornful laugh. “You scared Terri and me just about every time 
we saw you.” 

“That was just for fun,” Sam explained. “But we knew if you found out 
about the ghost...” His voice trailed off. 

“Have you seen him, too?” I asked, pulling my robe tighter around me. 

All three of them nodded. 

“We stay away from there,” Nat told me, scratching his arm. “The ghost is 
too scary.” 

“He’s really dangerous,” Louisa revealed. “I think he wants to kill us all.” 
Her eyes locked on mine. “Even you. You and Terri.” 

I shuddered. “Why? Terri and I didn’t do anything to him.” 

“It doesn’t matter. Nobody’s safe,” Sam said softly, glancing nervously out 
the window. “You saw the skeleton in the woods, right? That’s what the ghost 
will do to you if he catches you.” 

I shuddered again. I was really scared now. 

“There’s a way to get rid of the ghost,” Louisa said, breaking into my 
troubled thoughts. She was nervously clasping and unclasping her hands in her 
lap. “But we need your help,” she continued. “We can’t do it without you and 
Terri.” 

I swallowed hard. “What can Terri and I do?” I asked. 

Before she could answer, we heard creaking above our heads. Voices. 

Had we awakened Agatha and Brad? 

Louisa and her two brothers hurried to the window and lowered themselves 
to the ground. “Meet us at the beach—tomorrow morning,” Sam instructed. 

I stood at the window and watched them disappear into the woods. 

The room fell quiet again. The curtains fluttered gently. I stared out into the 
gently swaying pine trees. 



How can Terri and I help to get rid of an ancient ghost? I wondered. 
What can we do? 



17 


I woke up the next morning to the sound of rain. I jumped out of bed and ran to 
the window. The rain swirled in a gusting wind. In the garden, narrow rivulets of 
water had formed between the vegetable rows and trickled off into the yard. A 
thick fog had settled on the trees. 

“Do you believe this weather?” Terri asked, coming into my room. 

I spun away from the window. “Terri—listen. I have something to tell you.” 
I told her about my late-night talk with the three Sadlers. 

When I finished, Terri stared out the window. “So what do we do now? 
How can we meet them on the beach if it’s raining this hard?” 

“We can’t,” I said. “We have to wait till it stops.” 

“I hate suspense!” Terri moaned. She hurried back to her room to get 
dressed. 

I pulled on my old faded jeans, torn at both knees, and a gray sweatshirt, 
and hurried to join everyone for breakfast. Agatha cooked us oatmeal with big 
lumps of brown sugar and butter on top. 

After breakfast Brad built a big cozy fire and Terri worked on her 
wildflower collection on the floor in front of the fireplace. 

While Terri glued dried flower samples onto sheets of cardboard, I sat 
around and waited for the rain to stop. Stupid rain. 

The sun didn’t come out until after lunch. As soon as we could get away, 
Terri and I hurried to the beach. 

We waited there for nearly an hour. I practiced skipping stones, and Terri 
scrounged around for shells. No sign of Sam, Nat, and Louisa. 

“Now what?” I asked, kicking at a small rock. The whole day had been a 
big waste. 

“I brought my gravestone-rubbing stuff,” Terri replied. “Let’s go over to the 
cemetery.” 

We made our way to the small graveyard, climbed over the old stone wall, 
and took a good look around. The graves were so old. Many of the gravestones 
had been knocked over, or broken, or covered with weeds. 

The forest had started taking over. A couple of big trees had sprouted on top 
of graves, and one giant tree had crashed across the wall, knocking over several 



tombstones. 

“I’m going to look for something interesting by that big fallen tree,” Terri 
announced. 

Terri ran ahead, and I poked along at my own speed. The last time we were 
here, we stuck to the edge of the cemetery. Now I made my way into the middle. 

I started reading the names on the tombstones. The first one I stopped at 
read: Here lies the body of Martin Sadler. 

That’s strange, I thought. Another Sadler. I remembered that Sam had told 
us Sadler was a common name around here. Maybe this was the Sadler family 
section or something. 

The gravestone next to Martin Sadler belonged to Mary Sadler, his wife. 
Then a couple of Sadler kids, Sarah and Miles. 

I moved to the next row and continued reading the inscriptions. Another 
Sadler. This one was named Peter. Beside Peter lay Miriam Sadler. 

Whoa! I thought, starting to get the creeps. Didn’t anyone else ever die 
around here? 

I moved to another section. All Sadlers, too. Hiram, Margaret, Constance, 
Charity... 

Was this a whole cemetery of Sadlers? 

Terri’s scream cut through the air. “Jerry! Come here!” 

I found her near the fallen pine tree. Her face was twisted in confusion. 
“Look!” she instructed, pointing to a cluster of gravestones at her feet. 

I lowered my glance to two large stones. Thomas Sadler, died February 18, 
1641, and Priscilla Sadler, wife of Thomas. Died March 5, 1641. 

“Yeah, I know,” I told Terri. “The whole cemetery is filled with Sadlers. 
Creepy, huh?” 

“No. No. Check out the kids’ graves,” Terri said impatiently. 

I saw three small, identical stones lined up beside the parents. The three 
stones stood up straight. They were clean and easy to read. As if someone had 
taken care of them. 

I hunched down to read the names. “Sam Sadler, son of Thomas and 
Priscilla.” 

I straightened back up. “So?” 

“Read the next one,” Terri instructed. 

I lowered myself again. “Louisa Sadler.” 

“Uh-oh,” I murmured. “I bet I can guess the last name.” 



“I bet you can, too,” Terri replied in a trembling whisper. 

My eyes moved to the last marker. “Here lies Nat Sadler, who died in his 
fifth year of life.” 



18 


I stared at the three stones until they blurred before my eyes. 

Three stones. Three kids. 

Sam, Louisa, and Nat. 

All dead in the early 1600s. 

“I don’t get it,” I murmured. I felt dizzy as I climbed to my feet. “I just 
don’t get it.” 

“We have to ask Brad and Agatha about this,” Terri said. “This is just too 
weird!” 

We ran back to the cottage. I kept seeing those three stones as we ran. 

Sam, Louisa, and Nat. 

We found Brad and Agatha out back, under the trees in their matching 
rocking chairs. 

Agatha laughed as we came running up to them breathlessly. “You kids run 
everywhere, don’t you? Wish I had your pep.” 

“We were in the cemetery,” I blurted out. “We have to ask you about 
something.” 

She raised her eyebrows. “Oh? Were you working on gravestone rubbings?” 

“We didn’t get that far,” Terri told her. “We were reading the stones. They 
were all Sadlers. All of them.” 

Agatha’s chair rocked back and forth steadily. She nodded, but didn’t say 
anything. 

“You know those kids we met on the beach?” I broke in. “Well, we found 
tombstones for Sam, Louisa, and Nat Sadler. They died in 1640-something. But 
those are the same names as the kids we met!” 

Agatha and Brad rocked in unison. Back and forth. Back and forth. Agatha 
smiled up at me. “Well, what’s your question, Jerry?” 

“How come there are so many Sadlers in that graveyard?” I asked. “And 
how come those stones have our friends’ names on them?” 

“Good questions,” Brad muttered quietly. 

Agatha smiled. “It’s nice to see you’re both so observant. Sit down. It’s sort 
of a long story.” 

Terri and I dropped down onto the grass. “Tell us,” I urged impatiently. 



Agatha took a deep breath and began. “Well, in the winter of 1641, a large 
group of Sadlers, practically the whole family, sailed from England and settled 
here. They were Pilgrims who came to start a new life.” 

She glanced at Brad, who continued to rock, staring out at the shimmering 
trees. “It was one of the worst winters in history,” Agatha continued. “And, 
sadly, tragically, the Sadlers were unprepared for the cold. They died, one by 
one, and were buried in the little cemetery. By 1642, there were almost none 
left.” 

Brad tsk-tsked and shook his head. 

Agatha, rocking in a steady rhythm, continued. “Your friends Sam, Nat, and 
Louisa are your distant cousins. Like Brad and me. They were named for their 
ancestors, the children buried in the cemetery. We were named for our ancestors, 
too. You’ll find gravestones for an Agatha and Bradford Sadler in the cemetery, 
too.” 

“We will?” Terri cried. 

Agatha nodded solemnly. “That’s right. But your cousin and I aren’t quite 
ready for the bone-yard, yet. Are we, Brad?” 

Brad shook his head. “No, ma’am!” he replied, grinning. 

Terri and I laughed. 

Relieved laughter. 

I was so glad there was a good explanation for what we had seen. I 
suddenly felt tempted to tell Brad and Agatha about the ghost in the cave. 

But Terri started talking about wildflowers, and I settled onto the grass and 
kept my thoughts to myself. 


* * * 


We finally ran into Sam, Louisa, and Nat on the beach the next morning. 

“Where were you guys?” I asked. “We waited for you here all afternoon.” 
“Hey, give us a break,” Sam protested. “It was raining. We weren’t allowed 
outside.” 

“We were at the little graveyard yesterday,” Terri told them. “We saw three 
old gravestones with your names on them.” 

Louisa and Sam exchanged glances. “Those are our ancestors,” Sam said. 
“We were named after them.” 


“Jerry said you have a plan to get rid of the ghost,” Terri broke in. My sister 



always likes to get down to business. 

“We do,” Sam said, his expression turning serious. “Come with us.” He 
began walking quickly over the pebbly sand toward the cave. 

I hurried to catch up. “Whoa! Where are we going? I’m not climbing back 
inside that cave again. No way!” I cried. 

“Me either,” Terri agreed. “Being chased once by a ghost was enough for 

me.” 

Sam’s hazel eyes locked on mine. “You don’t have to go into the cave 
again. I promise.” 

He led us to the rocks below the cave. I gazed up, shielding my eyes against 
the bright sunlight. 

The cave looked a little less frightening in the daytime. The smooth, white 
stone gleamed. The dark entrance didn’t seem as deep and forbidding. 

Sam pointed up at the mouth. “See all those big rocks piled on top of the 
cave?” 

I squinted. “What about them?” 

“All you have to do is climb up there and push those rocks down. The rocks 
will cover the mouth of the cave, and the old ghost will be trapped inside 
forever.” 

Terri and I stared at the enormous, white rocks. Each one must have 
weighed about two hundred pounds. “You’re kidding, right?” I said. 

Louisa shook her head. “We’re very serious,” she murmured. 

“We cover the cave mouth with rocks?” I repeated, staring up at it. The dark 
hole seemed to stare back at me like a giant, black eye. “And that will keep the 
ghost inside? What will stop him from floating out? He’s a ghost, remember. He 
can float right through the rocks.” 

“No, he can’t,” Louisa explained. “The old legends say that the cave is a 
sanctuary. That means that if something evil gets trapped inside, it can’t escape 
through the ancient rocks. The ghost will be trapped inside forever.” 

Terri frowned. “So why didn’t you ever go up and push the rocks down?” 

“We’re too scared,” Nat blurted out. 

“If we mess up, the ghost could come after us,” Sam said. “We live here. He 
could find our house—and get revenge.” 

“We’ve been waiting for outsiders to come help us,” Louisa added, gazing 
at me with pleading eyes. “We’ve been waiting for someone we could trust.” 

“But what about us?” I demanded. “If we try to trap the ghost tonight and 



we mess up, won’t he come out looking for us?” 

“We won’t mess up,” Sam replied solemnly. “We’ll all work together. If the 
ghost comes out, Nat, Louisa, and I will distract him. We won’t let him see that 
you’re up on top.” 

“Will you help us? Please?” Louisa begged. “Our whole lives, the old ghost 
has terrified us.” 

“You would make everyone around here happy if you agreed to help trap 
him,” Sam added. 

I hesitated. So many things could go wrong. 

What if the rocks wouldn’t budge? What if the ghost floated out and found 
Terri and me up there? What if one of us slipped and fell off the top of the cave? 

No, I decided. No way. We can’t do it. It’s just too risky. 

I turned to tell them my decision. 

“Of course we’ll help you,” I heard Terri say. 



19 


We spent the afternoon picking blueberries with Agatha. Then we made 
blueberry ice cream using an old-fashioned churn. It tasted better than any ice 
cream I’d ever eaten. Agatha said it was because we picked the blueberries 
ourselves. 

As it got closer to suppertime, I started feeling more and more frightened. 
Were we really going to try to trap a ghost tonight? 

Dinnertime finally came. I hardly ate a thing. When Agatha stared at me, I 
explained I had filled up on ice cream. 

After dinner, Terri and I helped Agatha with the dishes. Then Brad insisted 
on showing me how to tie sailor knots. By this time, my stomach felt more 
knotted up than Brad’s rope! 

Finally, Terri and I said we were going to the beach to get some fresh air. 
And we hurried out to meet our three friends. 

It was a clear, cloudless night. Thousands of stars twinkled overhead. A 
heavy dew was falling. The full moon made it easy to see without a flashlight. 

Terri and I padded in silence along the path down to the beach. Neither of 
us felt like talking. I kept thinking about Mom and Dad’s warning to me before 
we left home to keep Terri from getting into trouble. 

Well, we’re in trouble now, I thought grimly. Deep trouble. Both of us. 

Maybe all five of us. 

Sam, Louisa, and Nat stood waiting at the edge of the shore. The moonlight 
made the dark water sparkle. I suddenly wished it weren’t so bright out. What 
we were about to do needed darkness. 

The knots in my stomach seemed to tighten as I greeted our three friends. 

Sam raised a finger to his lips and motioned for us to follow him. Silently, 
we picked our way across the rocks to the base of the cave. 

“Hey—look,” I whispered, staring up at the cave. The light flickered 
brightly in the entrance. 

The ghost was home. 

I stared up at the cave and planned our route. We’d go up the same way we 
had the other night. But instead of entering the cave, we’d keep climbing around 
the side until we reached the top. 



Terri fidgeted beside me. “Ready?” I whispered. 

She nodded grimly. 

“We’ll wait down here,” Sam whispered. “If the ghost comes out, we’ll be 
ready to distract him. Good luck.” 

The three of them stood huddled together. Their expressions were tense, 
frightened. Nat gripped Louisa’s hand. “Bye, Terri,” he said in a tiny voice. I 
think he had a little crush on her. 

“See you in a few minutes,” Terri whispered back to him. “Don’t worry, 
Nat. We’ll get rid of that bad ghost. Come on, Jerry.” 

My legs felt rubbery as Terri and I made our way over the rocks. We 
climbed steadily. Carefully. 

I glanced back at Terri, a few feet behind me. She was breathing hard, her 
eyes narrowed in concentration. 

We reached the mouth of the cave. The light inside shone brightly. 

I pointed to our right. Terri nodded. She followed me up the rocks on the 
side of the cave. 

The rocks were damp from the evening dew, and slippery. We were 
hunched on all fours as we climbed. It was steeper than I had thought. 

I struggled to keep from trembling. I knew that one slip could cause a rock 
slide. The ghost would know something was up. 

Hand over hand we climbed. 

Carefully. Steadily. 

I stopped to catch my breath and gazed down to the beach. Our three 
friends hadn’t moved. 

Holding on to a rock with one hand, I waved to them with my other. Nat 
waved back. The other two remained still, staring up at Terri and me. 

I reached the smooth rock surface of the top of the cave. Turning, I held out 
my hand and helped Terri up onto the narrow ledge. 

Together we checked out the situation. The rocks we were supposed to roll 
over the mouth of the cave weren’t as big as I’d thought. They were piled in a 
solid wall. It didn’t seem that difficult to get behind them and push them over. 

As I started to move behind the rock wall, I caught a glimpse of our three 
friends down below. To my surprise, Sam was waving his arms and jumping up 
and down. Louisa and Nat were also motioning frantically. 

“What’s wrong?” Terri cried. “Why are they doing that?” 

“They’re trying to tell us something,” I replied, feeling a chill of terror 



freeze every muscle. 

Had the ghost appeared in the cave mouth? 

Were Terri and I caught already ? 

I took a deep breath and, ignoring my fear, leaned over the edge to peer 
down at the mouth of the cave. 

No one there. 

“Jerry—stand up!” Terri cried. “You’ll fall!” 

I stood back up and peered down at the three kids. “Hey—!” I cried out as I 
saw them running to the woods. 

A stab of terror made me gasp. “Something’s gone wrong,” I croaked. 
“Let’s get out of here!” 

I turned in time to see the ghost step up behind us. 

His entire body shimmered, pale in the bright moonlight. His vacant, 
sunken eyes glared angrily at us. 

He grabbed me by the shoulder and wrapped his other bony hand around 
Terri’s waist. 

“Come with me,” he said in a dry whisper, a whisper of doom. 



20 


He dragged us down to the cave entrance. 

He’s so strong, I thought. So strong for someone old and frail-looking. 

The rocks slid under my feet, a gray blur. The ground appeared to tilt and 
sway. Long shadows seemed to reach out to me, to pull me down. 

I tried to cry out, but my breath caught in my throat. 

I tried to jerk free of his grasp. But he was too strong for me. 

Terri uttered loud, sobbing gasps. She thrashed her arms, struggling to free 
herself. 

But the old ghost held her tightly. 

Before I knew it, we were stumbling through the dark, twisting tunnels. The 
flickering candlelight grew brighter up ahead. We were too frightened to fight 
him, too frightened to break away. 

My shoulder scraped against the narrow tunnel wall. Terror tightened my 
throat. I couldn’t even cry out from the pain. 

The ghost released us as we reached the candlelit chamber. Glaring at us 
sternly, he motioned with a bony finger for us to follow him to his driftwood 
table. 

“Wh-what are you going to do to us?” Terri managed to choke out. 

He didn’t reply. 

He brushed the long, stringy white hair from over his face. Then he 
motioned for us to sit down on the floor. 

I dropped down quickly. My legs were shaking so hard, I was grateful not 
to have to stand. 

I glanced at my sister. Her lower lip was trembling. Her hands were clasped 
tightly in her lap. 

The old ghost cleared his throat. He leaned heavily against the crude table. 
“You are both in serious trouble,” he said in a thin, reedy voice. 

“We—we didn’t mean to do any harm,” I blurted out. 

“It is dangerous to get involved with ghosts,” he said, ignoring my words. 

“We’ll go away,” I offered desperately. “We’ll never come back.” 

“We didn’t mean to disturb you,” Terri added in a shrill voice. 



His sunken eyes suddenly widened in surprise. 

“Me?” A strange smile played across his pale face. 

“We won’t tell anyone we saw you,” I told him. 

His smile grew wider. “Me?” he repeated. He leaned forward on the large 
chunk of driftwood. “I’m not a ghost!” he cried. “Your three friends are!” 



21 


“Huh?” I gaped at the old ghost in disbelief. 

His smile faded. “I’m telling you the truth,” he said softly, rubbing his pale 
cheek with a bony hand. 

“You’re trying to trick us,” Terri replied. “Those three kids—” 

“They’re not kids,” the old man interrupted sharply. “They’re over 350 
years old!” 

Terri and I exchanged glances. The blood was pounding so hard at my 
temples, I couldn’t think clearly. 

“Allow me to introduce myself,” the old man said, lowering himself onto 
the table edge. His lined face flickered in the shifting candlelight. “I’m Harrison 
Sadler.” 

“Another Sadler?” I blurted out. 

“We’re Sadlers, too!” Terri cried. 

“I know,” he said softly. He coughed, a dry, hacking cough. “I came here 
from England quite a while ago,” he told us. 

“In 1641?” I demanded. 

He is a ghost, I realized with a shudder. 

My question seemed to amuse him. “I haven’t been here that long,” he 
replied dryly. “After college, I traced my ancestors here. I study ghosts and the 
occult.” He sighed. “It turned out there was plenty to study here.” 

I stared hard at him, studying him. Could he possibly be telling the truth? 
Was he human—not a ghost? 

Or was this an evil trick? 

His black, sunken eyes didn’t reveal anything to me. 

“Why did you drag us in here?” I demanded, climbing to my knees. 

“To warn you,” Harrison Sadler replied. “To warn you about the ghosts. 
You are in great danger here. I have studied them. I have seen their evil.” 

Terri let out a low cry. I couldn’t tell if she believed the old man or not. 

I realized that I didn’t believe him at all. His story didn’t make any sense. 

I climbed to my feet. “If you are a scientist studying the occult,” I said, 
“why are you shut up here in this weird cave?” 



He slowly raised his hand and motioned toward the shadowy ceiling. “This 
cave is a sanctuary,” he murmured. 

Sanctuary? That was the word that Sam had used. 

“Once inside this cave,” Harrison explained, “ghosts cannot escape through 
the rocks.” 

“So that means you are trapped in here,” I insisted. 

His eyes narrowed at me. “My plan is to trap the ghosts in here,” he replied 
softly. “That is why I stacked the rocks above the entrance. I hope some day to 
trap them in here forever.” 

I turned to my sister. She stared thoughtfully at Harrison. 

“But why are you living here?” I demanded. 

“I am safe here,” he replied. “The sanctuary keeps me safe. The ghosts 
cannot surprise me by coming through the rocks. Didn’t you wonder why they 
sent you up here instead of coming up themselves?” 

“They sent us up here because they’re terrified of you!” I shouted, 
forgetting my fear. “They sent us up here because you ’re the ghost!” 

His expression changed. He pushed himself away from the driftwood table 
and moved quickly toward Terri and me. His deep, sunken eyes glowed like dark 
coals. 

“What are you going to do?” I cried. 



22 


Harrison took another menacing step toward us. “You don’t believe me, do 
you?” he accused. 

Terri and I were too frightened to answer. 

“Wh-what are you going to do?” I repeated, my voice tiny and shrill. 

He glared at us for a long moment, the candlelight flickering over his pale 
face. “I’m going to let you go,” he said finally. 

Terri let out a cry of surprise. 

I edged back, toward the tunnel. 

“I’m going to let you go,” Harrison Sadler repeated. “So that you can 
examine the east corner of the old graveyard.” He waved a bony hand. “Go. Go 
now. To the graveyard.” 

“You—you’re really letting us go?” I stammered. 

“Once you’ve seen the east corner, you’ll come back,” Harrison replied 
mysteriously. “You’ll come back.” 

No way, I thought, my heart pounding. 

No way I’ll ever come near this frightening cave again. 

“Go!” the old ghost cried. 

Terri and I spun around and scrambled out of his chamber. Neither of us 
looked back. 

As we hurried out of the cave and down the rocks, I couldn’t get Harrison’s face 
out of my mind. I kept picturing his glowing, evil eyes, his long, stringy hair, his 
yellow teeth when he flashed us that eerie smile. With a shudder, I remembered 
the inhuman strength of his grip as he dragged Terri and me into his chamber. 

I also couldn’t stop thinking about Sam, Louisa, and Nat. There was no way 
they were ghosts. They were our friends. They had tried to warn Terri and me 
that the ghost was sneaking up behind us. 

They said they’d been terrified of Harrison their whole lives. And I 
remembered Nat’s sad face as he told us how much he was scared of ghosts. 

Harrison Sadler is a liar, I thought bitterly. 

A 350-year-old ghost of a liar. 

Down on the beach, Terri and I stopped to catch our breath. “He—he’s so 



scary!” Terri gasped. 

“I couldn’t believe he let us go,” I replied, bending over, pressing my hands 
against my knees, waiting for the sharp pain in my side to fade. 

I searched for our three frends. But they were nowhere to be seen. 

“Are we going to the graveyard?” I asked. 

“I know what he wants us to see,” Terri replied, gazing back up at the dark 
cave. “I know why he wants us to check out the east corner. That’s where we 
found the gravestones for Louisa, Nat, and Sam.” 

“Yeah, so?” 

“Harrison is just trying to scare us. He thinks if we see the old graves, it 
will prove to us that Louisa, Nat, and Sam are ghosts.” 

“But we already know the truth about those old graves,” I said. 

We stepped off the beach and into the trees. The air grew cooler. Moonlight 
trickling through the branches overhead made strange shadows stretch across our 
path. 

We reached the cemetery entrance and stopped. 

“Might as well check it out,” Terri murmured. I followed her through the 
graveyard, stepping over footstones and loose brush as we made our way to the 
east corner. 

A pale beam of moonlight played over the three old Sadler kids’ graves. 
“See anything strange?” Terri whispered. 

My eyes roamed the area. “Nope.” 

We stepped up to the Sadler kids’ graves. 

“These look the same as yesterday,” I said. “Neat, square... whoa!” 

Something caught my eye in the corner. 

“What’s your problem?” Terri demanded. 

My eyes struggled to see in the pale light. “I think there’s something...” 

“Huh? Do you see something?” Terri cried. 

“Some fresh dirt,” I said. “In the corner. On the other side of that fallen tree. 
It looks like a fresh grave.” 

“No way,” said Terri. “I’ve checked out all these gravestones. No one’s 
been buried in here for the last fifty years.” 

We took a couple of steps toward the fallen tree. 

“Jerry! You’re right! It is a grave,” Terri whispered. “Afresh grave.” 

We stepped over the fallen tree trunk, keeping close together. A narrow 
shaft of moonlight lit up the freshly dug ground. 



“It’s two graves!” I gasped. “Two fresh graves with little markers on them.” 
I squatted down to try to read them. Terri moved behind me. “What do they 
say, Jerry?” 

My mouth went dry. I couldn’t answer her. 

“Jerry? Can you read them?” 

“Yes,” I finally choked out. “It’s us, Terri. The names on these markers 
read, ‘Jerry Sadler and Terri Sadler’.” 



23 


“Wh-what does this mean?” I stammered. 

“Who dug these graves?” Terri asked. “Who put up these markers?” 

“Let’s get out of here,” I urged, grabbing her arm. “Let’s go tell Agatha and 
Brad.” 

Terri hesitated. 

“We have to,” I insisted. “We have to tell them everything. We should have 
told them a long time ago.” 

“Okay,” Terri agreed. 

I turned to leave—and gasped when I saw the three figures staring at us 
from the shadows. 

Sam stepped quickly over the fallen tree. “Where are you going?” he asked. 
“What are you doing here?” 

Louisa and Nat followed close behind him. 

“We—we’re going back to the cottage,” I told them. “It’s late, and—” 

“Did you kill the ghost?” Nat demanded. His eyes peered up at me 
hopefully. 

I patted his hair. It felt real. His head was warm. He didn’t feel ghostlike at 
all. He was a real little boy. 

Harrison Sadler is a total liar, I thought. 

“Did you kill the old ghost?” Nat repeated eagerly. 

“No. We couldn’t,” I told him. Nat let out a disappointed sigh. 

“Then how did you get away?” Sam demanded suspiciously. 

“We ran away,” Terri told him. 

It was almost the truth. 

“Where were you guys?” I demanded. 

“Yeah. You didn’t do a very good job of distracting him,” Terri added 
sharply. 

“We—we tried to warn you,” Louisa replied, tugging nervously at a strand 
of long, auburn hair. “Then we got scared. We ran into the woods and hid.” 

“When we didn’t hear the rocks fall, we got even more scared,” Sam added. 
“We were afraid the ghost got you. We were afraid we would never see you 



again.” 

Nat uttered a frightened sob and took Louisa’s hand. “We have to kill the 
ghost,” the little guy whimpered. “We have to.” 

Sam and Louisa tried to comfort their little brother. I gazed down at the two 
fresh graves. A cool wind made the trees whisper and shake. 

I started to ask Sam about the two graves. But he spoke before I had a 
chance. “Let’s try again,” he said, staring hard at Terri then me with pleading 
eyes. 

Louisa rested her hands on Nat’s tiny shoulders. “Yes,” she agreed softly. 
“Let’s go back and try again.” 

“No way!” I cried. “Terri and I got away from there once. I’m not going 
back and—” 

“But it’s the perfect time!” Louisa insisted. “He’ll never expect you to come 
back tonight. We’ll catch him completely offguard. It will be a total surprise.” 

“Please!” Nat begged in a tiny voice. 

I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. I couldn’t believe they were 
asking us to do this. 

Terri and I had risked our lives by climbing up there. We could have been 
killed by that lying old ghost. We could look like that horrible dog skeleton right 
now. 

And here they were, asking us to climb right back up there and try again. 

It was a ridiculous idea. No way I would agree to it. No way! 

“Okay,” I heard my sister say. “We’ll do it.” Louisa and her brothers burst 
into happy cheers. Terri had done it to me again. 



24 


Terri led the way to the beach. I scrambled to catch up with her. The three 
Sadlers, talking excitedly among themselves, trailed behind. 

The night suddenly seemed darker, as if someone had dimmed the lights. I 
raised my eyes, searching for the full moon. But it had disappeared behind heavy 
clouds. 

I felt a large raindrop on my shoulder, then another on the top of my head. 
The wind picked up as we neared the ocean. 

“Are you totally crazy?” I whispered to my sister as we made our way over 
the pebbly sand toward the cave. “How could you agree to do this?” 

“We have to solve the mystery,” Terri replied, glancing up at the cave. It sat 
darkly above the rocks. No flickering light. No sign of the old ghost. 

“This isn’t one of your dumb mystery books,” I told her angrily. “This is 
real life. We could be in terrible danger.” 

“We already are,” she replied mysteriously. She said something else, but the 
strong wind off the ocean carried her words away. 

The raindrops started to come down faster. Large, heavy drops. 

“Stop, Terri,” I demanded. “Let’s turn back. Let’s tell the kids we changed 
our minds.” 

She shook her head. 

“Let’s at least go back to the cottage and tell Agatha and Brad,” I pleaded. 
“We can trap the ghost tomorrow. During the day, maybe...” 

Terri kept walking. She picked up the pace. “We have to solve the mystery, 
Jerry,” she said again. “Those two fresh graves—they really scared me. I have to 
find out the truth.” 

“But, Terri—the truth is, we might get killed!” I cried. 

She didn’t seem to hear me. I brushed raindrops from my eyebrows. The 
gusting winds were swirling the rain around us. The rain pattered against the 
rocks, sounding like sharp drumbeats. 

We stopped at the bottom of the rocks. Up above, the cave stood over us, 
still completely dark. 

“We’ll wait down here,” Sam said. His eyes kept darting up to the cave. I 
could tell he was really frightened. “This time we’ll do a better job of distracting 



the ghost if he comes out.” 

“He better not come out,” I muttered, lowering my head against the falling 

rain. 

A jagged bolt of white lightning crackled across the sky. 

I shivered. 

“Come up with us,” Terri told the three of them. “You can’t help us way 
down here.” 

They hung back. I could see the fear on their faces. 

“Come up to the cave entrance,” Terri urged. “You can always run down the 
rocks if the ghost appears.” 

Louisa shook her head. “We’re too afraid,” she confessed. 

“We need your help,” Terri insisted. “We don’t want the ghost to know 
we’re on top of the cave. Come stand on the ledge in front of the cave. Then—” 

“No! He’ll hurt us! He’ll eat us up!” Nat cried. 

“Jerry and I can’t go up there again unless you come up to help us,” Terri 
insisted firmly. 

Louisa and Sam exchanged frightened glances. Nat clung to Louisa, 
trembling. The rain swept down harder. 

Finally Sam nodded. “Okay. We’ll wait for you at the cave mouth.” 

“We don’t mean to be so frightened,” Louisa added. “It’s just that we’ve 
been afraid of him our whole lives. He—he—” Her voice trailed off. 

We turned and started our climb. It was much harder this time. It was so 
much darker without the moon. Rain kept blowing into my eyes. And the rocks 
were slippery and wet. 

I stumbled twice, fell forward, scraping my knees and elbows. The wet 
rocks kept sliding under my sneakers, rolling down toward the beach. 

Another jagged bolt of lightning stretched across the sky, making the cave 
glow white above us. 

We stopped at the ledge in front of the dark cave mouth. My entire body 
trembled. From the rain. From the cold. From fear. 

“Let’s just warm up inside for a moment,” Terri suggested. 

The three Sadlers clung together. “No, we can’t. We’re too scared,” Louisa 
replied. 

“Just for a second,” Terri insisted. “Just to wipe the rain from our eyes. 
Look—it’s coming down in sheets.” 

She practically shoved Louisa and her brothers into the cave. Nat began to 



cry. He held on tightly to his sister. 

A roar of thunder made us all jump. 

This is the dumbest thing I have ever done, I thought, shivering. 

I will never forgive Terri for this. Never. 

And then a yellow light flared in front of us at the mouth of the cave. 

And under the yellow light, the old ghost flickered into view. He carried a 
flaming torch in one hand. A strange smile played over his pale face. 

“Well, well,” he uttered in a voice just loud enough to be heard over the 
rain. “Here we all are.” 



25 


“Nooo!” Nat let out a terrified wail and tried to bury his head in his sister’s wet 
T-shirt. Sam and Louisa froze like statues. The flickering light of the torch 
revealed expressions of horror on their faces. 

Harrison Sadler stood in the cave entrance blocking our escape. His dark, 
sunken eyes peered from one of us to the next. 

Behind him, the rain crashed down, glowing eerily from flashes of bright 
lightning. 

He turned his attention to Terri and me. “You brought the ghosts to me,” he 

said. 

“You’re the ghost!” Sam cried. 

Nat wailed, his arms wrapped tightly around Louisa’s waist. 

“You have terrified people long enough,” the old man told the three 
trembling kids. “More than three hundred years. It is time for you to leave this 
place. Time for you to rest.” 

“He’s crazy!” Louisa cried to me. “Don’t listen to him!” 

“Don’t let him fool you,” Sam added with emotion. “Look at him! Look at 
his eyes! Look where he lives—all alone in this dark cave! He’s the three- 
hundred-year-old ghost. And he’s lying to you!” 

“Don’t hurt us!” Nat wailed, clinging to Louisa. “Please don’t hurt us!” 

The rain suddenly slowed. Water splattered off the rocks outside and 
dripped steadily from the top of the cave. Thunder rumbled, but in the distance. 
The storm was moving out to sea. 

I turned and caught the strangest expression on my sister’s face. To my 
surprise, Terri was actually smiling. 

She caught me staring at her. “The solution,” she whispered. 

And I suddenly realized why she had agreed to come back to this 
frightening cave, to face the frightening old man again. 

Terri wanted to solve the mystery. She needed to solve it. 

Who was the ghost? 

Was it Harrison Sadler? Or was Harrison telling us the truth? Were our 
three friends the ghosts? 

My sister is really crazy, I thought, shaking my head. She risked our lives 



because she had to solve the mystery. 

“Let us go,” Sam told the old man, breaking into my thoughts. “Let us go, 
and we won’t tell anyone we saw the ghost.” 

The torchlight dipped low as a strong gust of wind invaded the cave. 
Harrison’s eyes seemed to grow darker. “I’ve waited too long to get you here,” 
he said quietly. 

Louisa suddenly reached out to Terri. “Help us!” she cried. “You believe us 
—don’t you?” 

“You know we’re alive, not ghosts,” Sam said to me. “Help us get away 
from him. He’s evil, Jerry. We’ve seen his evil our whole lives.” 

I turned from Harrison to the three kids. 

Who was telling the truth? Who was alive? And who had been dead for 
over three hundred years? 

Harrison’s face hovered darkly in the dipping, waving torchlight. He pushed 
his long, stringy hair off his forehead with his free hand. And then he startled us 
all by puckering his dry lips and letting out a long, high-pitched whistle. 

My heart skipped a beat. I gasped. What was he doing? Why was he 
making that shrill sound? 

He stopped. Then whistled again. 

I heard the scraping of footsteps, rapid footsteps on the stone cave floor. 

And then a low, dark figure came loping toward us out of the darkness. 



26 


A monster! I thought. 

A ghost monster. 

It uttered low, menacing growls as it neared. Its head bobbed low, and two 
red eyes flared as the creature bounded into the light of the flaming torch. 

“Oh!” I cried out as I saw that it was a dog. A long, lean German shepherd. 

The dog stopped a few feet in front of us. When it saw Harrison, it bared its 
teeth. Its growl became a ferocious snarl. 

Dogs can recognize ghosts, I remembered. 

Dogs can recognize ghosts. 

The dog’s red eyes caught the light of the torch as it turned to Louisa and 
her two brothers. 

It reared back on its hind legs—and began to howl and bark. 

“They’re the ghosts!” Harrison Sadler cried triumphantly to Terri and me, 
pointing. 

Snarling, the big dog leaped at Sam. 

With a cry of fright, Sam raised both arms to shield himself. 

The three kids edged deeper into the cave. 

The dog barked fiercely, baring its jagged teeth. 

“You—you really are ghosts?” I cried out. 

Louisa let out a pained sigh. “We never had a chance to live!” she cried. 
“The first winter—it was so horrible!” Tears rolled down her cheeks. I saw that 
Nat was crying, too. 

The dog continued to snarl and rage. The three kids backed farther into the 
dark chamber. 

“We sailed here with our parents to start a new life,” Sam explained in a 
trembling voice. “But we all died in the cold. It wasn’t fair! It just wasn’t fair!” 

The rain started up again. The wind blew sheets of water into the cave 
entrance. The torch flame dipped and nearly blew out. 

“We never had a life at all!” Louisa cried. 

Thunder roared. The cave seemed to shake. The dog growled and snarled. 

And as I stared at the three kids in the wavering light, they began to change. 



Their hair dropped off first. It fell in clumps to the cave floor. 

And then their skin peeled away, curling up and falling off—until three 
grinning skulls stared at Terri and me through empty eye sockets. 

“Come stay with us, cousins'.” Louisa’s skull whispered. Her bony fingers 
reached out toward us. 

“Join usssss!” Sam hissed. His fleshless jaw slid up and down. “We dug 
such nice graves for you. So close to ours.” 

“Play with me,” Nat’s skull pleaded. “Stay and play with me. I don’t want 
you to go. Ever!” 

The three ghosts moved toward us, their skeleton hands outstretched, 
reaching, reaching for Terri and me. 

I gasped and stumbled back. 

I saw a frightened Harrison stagger back, too. 

And then the torch blew out. 



27 


The torchlight flickered and died. 

The heavy darkness made me gasp. 

I could feel bodies moving, scraping over the wet stone cave floor. 

I could hear the whispered pleas of the three ghosts. 

Closer. Closer. 

And then a cold hand gripped mine. 

I screamed before I heard her whispered voice: “Jerry—run!” 

Terri! 

Before I could catch my breath, my sister was pulling me through the 
darkness. 

Into the rain. Onto the slippery rock ledge. 

“Run! Run!” Terri cried, her eyes wild, her cold hand still gripping mine. 
“Run! Run!” 

The word became a desperate chant. 

“Run! Run!” 

But as we struggled to lower ourselves down the rocks, the roar of thunder 
drowned out Terri’s shouts. 

The ground shook. 

My legs nearly slid out from under me. 

I cried out when I realized the roar in my ears wasn’t thunder. 

Half-blinded by the rain, Terri and I spun around in time to see the rocks 
topple from the top of the cave. 

The rain and wind must have loosened them. And now the big boulders 
rumbled down, cracking, knocking against each other, bumping, and rolling. 
Rock after rock, thudding onto the stone ledge. 

Until the dark cave mouth was completely covered. 

Shielding my eyes from the rain with both hands, I peered up at the cave, 
and waited. 

Waited to see if anyone would come out. 

But no one did. 

No ghostly kids. 



No old man. 

Harrison Sadler had given his life to capture the ghosts. 

The cave glimmered white in a flash of lightning. 

Now it was my turn to pull Terri away. “Let’s go,” I pleaded. 
But she didn’t budge. She stood staring through the rain at 

cave. 

“Terri—please. Let’s go. It’s over,” I said, tugging her away, 
is solved. The terror—it’s all over.” 


the closed-up 
“The mystery 



28 


A few minutes later, Agatha threw open the front door of the cottage and rushed 
out to greet us. “Where were you? Brad and I were worried sick!” 

She ushered us in, fussing over us, shaking her head, talking excitedly, glad 
we were back safe and sound. 

Terri and I got dried off and into clean clothes. 

The rain had stopped by the time we joined Brad and Agatha in the kitchen 
for steaming mugs of hot cider. Outside the kitchen window, the wind still blew 
the trees, sending water cascading down from the leaves. 

“Now tell us what happened to you,” Brad said. “Agatha and I really were 
terribly upset that you were out in this storm.” 

“It’s kind of a long story,” I told them, warming my hands on the hot cider 
mug. “I don’t know where to start.” 

“Start at the beginning,” Brad said quietly. “That’s usually the best place.” 

Terri and I did our best to tell them the whole story of the three ghostly 
kids, the old man, and the frightening cave. As we talked, I could see their 
expressions changing. 

I could see how worried they were for Terri and me. And I could see how 
unhappy they were that we had ignored their wishes and ventured into the cave. 

When I finished the story, the room grew quiet. Brad stared out the window 
at the dripping rainwater on the glass. Agatha cleared her throat, but didn’t 
speak. 

“We’re really sorry,” Terri said, breaking the silence. “I hope you’re not 
angry at us.” 

“The important thing is that you’re both safe and sound,” Agatha replied. 

She stood up, stepped over to Terri, and gave her a warm hug. 

Agatha started toward me, her arms outstretched—when a sound outside 
made her stop. 

Barking. Loud dog barking. 

Terri lunged for the back door and pulled it open. “Jerry—look!” she cried. 
“It’s Harrison Sadler’s dog. He got out of the cave. He must have followed us 
here.” 

I moved to the open doorway. The dog had been drenched in the rain. Its 



wet gray fur was matted to its back. 

Terri and I reached out to pet the dog. 

But to our surprise, it reared back and growled. 

“Easy, boy,” I said. “You must be really frightened, huh?” 

The dog snarled at me and started to bark. 

Terri bent down and tried to soothe the animal. But it backed away from 
her, barking ferociously. 

“Whoa!” I cried. “I’m your friend—remember? I’m no ghost!” 

Terri turned to me, her expression puzzled. “You’re right. We’re not ghosts. 
Why is it carrying on like that?” 

I shrugged. “Whoa. Easy, boy. Easy.” 

The dog ignored my pleas, barking and howling. 

I turned back to see Brad and Agatha huddled against the kitchen wall, their 
faces tight with fear. 

“That’s only Brad and Agatha,” I told the dog. “They’re nice people. They 
won’t hurt you.” 

And then I swallowed hard. My heart began to throb. 

I realized why the dog was barking like that. He was barking at Brad and 
Agatha. 

Agatha stepped into the doorway, shaking her finger at the snarling animal. 
“Bad dog!” she cried. “Bad dog! Now you’ve given away our secret, too!” 

Terri gasped. She realized what Agatha was saying. 

Agatha slammed the kitchen door hard and turned back to Brad. “What a 
pity that dog had to show up,” she said, shaking her head fretfully. “Now what 
do we do with these two kids, Brad? What do we do with the kids?”

RETURN OF 
THE MUMMY 


Goosebumps - 23 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


“Gabe, we will be landing soon,” the stewardess told me, leaning over the 
seat. “Will someone be meeting you at the airport?” 

“Yes. Probably an ancient Egyptian pharaoh,” I told her. “Or maybe a 
disgusting, decaying mummy.” 

She narrowed her eyes at me. “No. Really,” she insisted. “Who will be 
meeting you in Cairo?” 

“My Uncle Ben,” I replied. “But he likes to play practical jokes. 
Sometimes he dresses in weird costumes and tries to scare me.” 

“You told me that your uncle was a famous scientist,” the stewardess 

said. 

“He is,” I replied. “But he’s also weird.” 

She laughed. I liked her a lot. She had pretty blond hair. And I liked 
the way she always tilted her head to one side when she talked. 

Her name was Nancy, and she had been very nice to me during the 
long flight to Egypt. She knew it was my first time flying all by myself. 

She kept checking on me and asking me how I was doing. But she 
treated me like a grown-up. She didn’t bring me one of those dumb 
connect-the-dots books or a plastic wings pin that they always give to kids 
on planes. And she kept slipping me extra bags of peanuts, even though she 
wasn’t supposed to. 

“Why are you visiting your uncle?” Nancy asked. “Just for fun?” 

I nodded. “I did it last summer, too,” I told her. “It was really 
awesome! But this year, Uncle Ben has been digging in an unexplored 
pyramid. He’s discovered an ancient, sacred tomb. And he invited me to be 
with him when he opens it up.” 

She laughed and tilted her head a little more. “You have a good 
imagination, Gabe,” she said. Then she turned away to answer a man’s 
question. 

I do have a good imagination. But I wasn’t making that up. 

My Uncle Ben Hassad is a famous archaeologist. He has been digging 
around in pyramids for lots of years. I’ve seen newspaper articles about 
him. And once he was in National Geographic. 



Last summer, my entire family visited Cairo. My cousin Sari and I— 
she’s Uncle Ben’s daughter—had some amazing adventures down in the 
chambers of the Great Pyramid. 

Sari will be there this summer, too, I remembered, staring out the plane 
window at the solid blue sky. I wondered if maybe she would give me a 
break this time. 

I like Sari, but she’s so competitive! She always has to be the first, the 
strongest, the smartest, the best. She’s the only thirteen-year-old girl I know 
who can turn eating breakfast into a contest! 

“Flight attendants, prepare for landing,” the pilot announced over the 
loudspeaker. 

I sat up to get a better view out the window. As the plane lowered, I 
could see the city of Cairo beneath us. A slender blue ribbon curled along 
the city. That, I knew, was the Nile River. 

The city stretched out from the river. Peering straight down, I could 
see tall, glass skyscrapers and low, domed temples. Where the city ended, 
the desert began. Yellow sand stretched to the horizon. 

My stomach began to feel a little fluttery. The pyramids were 
somewhere out in that desert. And in a day or two, I would be climbing 
down into one of them, following my uncle into a tomb that hadn’t been 
opened for thousands of years. 

What would we find? 

I pulled the little mummy hand from my shirt pocket and gazed down 
at it. It was so tiny—no bigger than a child’s hand. I had bought it from a 
kid at a garage sale for two dollars. He said it was called a “Summoner.” He 
said it could summon ancient evil spirits. 

It looked like a mummy hand. The fingers were wrapped in stained 
gauze bandages, with a little black tar showing through. 

I thought it was a fake, made of rubber or plastic. I mean, I never 
thought it was a real mummy hand. 

But last summer, the hand had saved all of our lives. The kid who sold 
it to me was right. It really did bring a bunch of mummies to life! It was 
amazing ! 

Of course my parents and my friends back home didn’t believe my 
incredible story And they didn’t believe that the Summoner really worked. 
They said it was just a joke mummy hand made in some souvenir factory 



Probably made in Taiwan. 

But I carry it with me wherever I go. It is my good luck charm. I’m not 
very superstitious. I mean, I walk under ladders all the time. And my lucky 
number is thirteen. 

But I really do believe that the little mummy hand will protect me. 

The strange thing about the mummy hand is that it is always warm. It 
doesn’t feel like plastic. It feels warm, like a real human hand. 

Back home in Michigan, I had a major panic attack when Mom and 
Dad were packing my suitcase for the flight. I couldn’t find the mummy 
hand. And, of course, there was no way I would go to Egypt without it! 

I was so relieved when I finally found it. It was tucked into the back 
pocket of a crumpled-up pair of jeans. 

Now, as the plane nosed down for a landing, I reached for the hand in 
the pocket of my T-shirt. I pulled it out—and gasped. 

The hand was cold. Cold as ice! 



2 


Why had the mummy hand suddenly turned cold? 

Was it some kind of a message? A warning? 

Was I heading into danger? 

I didn’t have time to think about it. The plane rolled into the gate, and 
the passengers were scrambling to pull down their carry-on bags and push 
their way out of the plane. 

I tucked the mummy hand into my jeans pocket, hoisted up my 
backpack, and headed to the front. I said good-bye to Nancy and thanked 
her for all the peanuts. Then I followed the others down the long, covered 
ramp and into the airport. 

So many people! 

And they all seemed to be in a hurry. They were practically stepping 
over each other. Men in dark business suits. Women in loose-flowing robes, 
their faces covered by veils. Teenage girls in jeans and T-shirts. A group of 
dark, serious-looking men in silky white suits that looked like pajamas. A 
family with three little kids, all crying. 

I had a sudden sinking feeling. How would I ever find Uncle Ben in 
this crowd? 

My backpack began to feel very heavy. My eyes frantically searched 
back and forth. Strange voices surrounded me, all talking so loudly. No one 
was speaking English. 

“Ow!” I cried out as I felt a sharp pain in my side. 

I turned and realized that a woman had bumped me with her luggage 

cart. 

Stay calm, Gabe, I instructed myself. Just stay calm. 

Uncle Ben is here, looking for you. He’ll find you. You just have to 
stay calm. 

But what if my uncle forgot? I asked myself. What if he got mixed up 
about what day I was arriving? Or what if he got busy down in the pyramid 
and lost track of the time? 

I can be a real worrier if I put my mind to it. 

And right now I was worrying enough for three people! 



If Uncle Ben isn’t here, I’ll go to a phone and call him, I decided. 

For sure. 

I could just hear myself saying, “Operator, can I speak to my uncle at 
the pyramids, please?” 

I don’t think that would work too well. 

I didn’t have a phone number for Uncle Ben. I wasn’t sure he even had 
a phone out where he was staying. All I knew was that he had been living in 
a tent somewhere near the pyramid where he was digging. 

Gazing frantically around the crowded arrival area, I was just about to 
give in to total panic—when a large man came walking up to me. 

I couldn’t see his face. He wore a long, white, hooded robe. It’s called 
a burnoose. And his face was buried inside the hood. 

“Taxi?” he asked in a high, shrill voice. “Taxi? American taxi?” 

I burst out laughing. “Uncle Ben!” I cried happily. 

“Taxi? American taxi? Taxi ride?” he insisted. 

“Uncle Ben! I’m so glad to see you!” I exclaimed. I threw my arms 
around his waist and gave him a big hug. Then, laughing at his stupid 
disguise, I reached up and pulled back his hood. 

The man under the hood had a bald, shaved head and a heavy black 
mustache. He glared at me furiously. 

I had never seen him before in my life. 



3 


“Gabe! Gabe! Over here!” 

I heard a voice calling my name. Glancing past the angry man, I saw 
Uncle Ben and Sari. They were waving to me from in front of the 
reservations counter. 

The man’s face turned bright red, and he shouted something at me in 
Arabic. I was glad I couldn’t understand him. He kept muttering as he 
pulled up the hood of his burnoose. 

“Sorry about that!” I cried. Then I dodged past him and hurried to 
greet Uncle Ben and my cousin. 

Uncle Ben shook my hand and said, “Welcome to Cairo, Gabe.” He 
was wearing a loose-fitting, white, short-sleeved sportshirt and baggy 
chinos. 

Sari wore faded denim cutoffs and a bright green tank top. She was 
already laughing at me. A bad start. “Was that a friend of yours?” she 
teased. 

“I—I made a mistake,” I confessed. I glanced back. The man was still 
scowling at me. 

“Did you really think that was Daddy?” Sari demanded. 

I mumbled a reply. Sari and I were the same age. But I saw that she 
was still an inch taller than me. She had let her black hair grow. It fell down 
her back in a single braid. 

Her big, dark eyes sparkled excitedly. She loved making fun of me. 

I told them about my flight as we walked to the baggage area to get my 
suitcase. I told them how Nancy, the stewardess, kept slipping me bags of 
peanuts. 

“I flew here last week,” Sari told me. “The stewardess let me sit in 
First Class. Did you know you can have an ice-cream sundae in First 
Class?” 

No, I didn’t know that. I could see that Sari hadn’t changed a bit. 

She goes to a boarding school in Chicago since Uncle Ben has been 
spending all of his time in Egypt. Of course she gets straight A’s. And she’s 
a champion skier and tennis player. 



Sometimes I feel a little sorry for her. Her mom died when Sari was 
five. And Sari only gets to see her dad on holidays and during the summer. 

But as we waited for my suitcase to come out on the conveyor belt, I 
wasn’t feeling sorry for her at all. She was busy bragging about how this 
pyramid was twice as big as the one I’d been in last summer. And how 
she’d already been down in it several times, and how she’d take me on a 
tour—if I wasn’t too afraid. 

Finally, my bulging, blue suitcase appeared. I lugged it off the 
conveyor and dropped it at my feet. It weighed a ton! 

I tried to lift it, but I could barely budge it. 

Sari pushed me out of the way. “Let me get that,” she insisted. She 
grabbed the handle, raised the suitcase off the floor, and started off with it. 

“Hey—!” I called after her. What a show-off! 

Uncle Ben grinned at me. “I think Sari has been working out,” he said. 
He put a hand on my shoulder and led me toward the glass doors. “Let’s get 
to the jeep.” 

We loaded the suitcase into the back of the jeep, then headed toward the 
city. “It’s been sweltering hot during the day,” Uncle Ben told me, mopping 
his broad forehead with a handkerchief. “And then cool at night.” 

Traffic crawled on the narrow street. Horns honked constantly. Drivers 
kept their horns going whether they moved or stopped. The noise was 
deafening. 

“We’re not stopping in Cairo,” Uncle Ben explained. “We’re going 
straight to the pyramid at Al-Jizah. We’re all living in tents out there so we 
can be close to our work.” 

“I hope you brought bug spray,” Sari complained. “The mosquitoes are 
as big as frogs!” 

“Don’t exaggerate,” Uncle Ben scolded. “Gabe isn’t afraid of a few 
mosquitoes—are you?” 

“No way,” I replied quietly. 

“How about scorpions?” Sari demanded. 

The traffic grew lighter as we left the city behind and headed into the 
desert. The yellow sand gleamed under the hot afternoon sun. Waves of 
heat rose up in front of us as the jeep bumped over the narrow, two-lane 
road. 



Before long, a pyramid came into view. Behind the waves of heat off 
the desert floor, it looked like a wavering mirage. It didn’t seem real. 

As I stared out at it, my throat tightened with excitement. I had seen 
the pyramids last summer. But it was still a thrilling sight. 

“I can’t believe the pyramids are over four thousand years old!” I 
exclaimed. 

“Yeah. That’s even older than me!” Uncle Ben joked. His expression 
turned serious. “It fills me with pride every time I see them, Gabe,” he 
admitted. “To think that our ancient ancestors were smart enough and 
skilled enough to build these marvels.” 

Uncle Ben was right. I guess the pyramids have special meaning for 
me since my family is Egyptian. Both sets of my grandparents came from 
Egypt. They moved to the United States around 1930. My mom and dad 
were born in Michigan. 

I think of myself as a typical American kid. But there’s still something 
exciting about visiting the country where your ancestors came from. 

As we drove nearer, the pyramid appeared to rise up in front of us. Its 
shadow formed a long, blue triangle over the yellow sand. 

Cars and tour buses jammed a small parking lot. I could see a row of 
saddled camels tethered on one side of the lot. A crowd of tourists stretched 
across the sand, gazing up at the pyramid, snapping photographs, chatting 
noisily and pointing. 

Uncle Ben turned the jeep onto a narrow side road, and we headed 
away from the crowd, toward the back of the pyramid. As we drove into the 
shade, the air suddenly felt cooler. 

“I’d kill for an ice-cream cone!” Sari wailed. “I’ve never been so hot in 
my life.” 

“Let’s not talk about the heat,” Uncle Ben replied, sweat dripping 
down his forehead into his bushy eyebrows. “Let’s talk about how happy 
you are to see your father after so many months.” 

Sari groaned. “I’d be happier to see you if you were carrying an ice¬ 
cream cone.” 

Uncle Ben laughed. 

A khaki-uniformed guard stepped in front of the jeep. Uncle Ben held 
up a blue ID card. The guard waved us past. 

As we followed the road behind the pyramid, a row of low, white 



canvas tents came into view. “Welcome to the Pyramid Hilton!” Uncle Ben 
joked. “That’s our luxury suite over there.” He pointed to the nearest tent. 

“It’s pretty comfortable,” he said, parking the jeep beside the tent. “But 
the room service is lousy.” 

“And you have to watch out for scorpions,” Sari warned. 

She’d say anything to try to scare me. 

We unloaded my suitcase. Then Uncle Ben led us up to the base of the 
pyramid. 

A camera crew was packing up its equipment. A young man, covered 
in dust, climbed out of a low entrance dug into one of the limestone 
squares. He waved to my uncle, then hurried toward the tents. 

“One of my people,” Uncle Ben muttered. He motioned toward the 
pyramid. “Well, here you are, Gabe. Along way from Michigan, huh?” 

I nodded. “It’s amazing,” I told him, shielding my eyes to gaze up to 
the top. “I forgot how much bigger the pyramids look in person.” 

“Tomorrow I’ll take you both down to the tomb,” Uncle Ben promised. 
“You’ve come at just the right time. We’ve been digging for months and 
months. And at long last, we are about to break the seal and enter the tomb 
itself.” 

“Wow!” I exclaimed. I wanted to be cool in front of Sari. But I 
couldn’t help it. I was really excited. 

“Guess you’ll be really famous after you open the tomb, huh, Dad?” 
Sari asked. She swatted a fly on her arm. “Ow!” 

“I’ll be so famous, the flies will be afraid to bite you,” Uncle Ben 
replied. “By the way, do you know what they called flies in ancient Egypt?” 

Sari and I shook our heads no. 

“I don’t either!” Uncle Ben said, grinning. One of his dumb jokes. He 
had an endless supply of them. His expression suddenly changed. “Oh. That 
reminds me. I have a present for you, Gabe.” 

“A present?” 

“Now, where did I put it?” He dug both hands into the pockets of his 
baggy chinos. 

As he searched, I saw something move behind him. A shadow over my 
uncle’s shoulder, back at the low opening to the pyramid. 

I squinted at it. 

The shadow moved. A figure stepped out slowly. 



At first I thought the sun was playing tricks on my eyes. 

But as I squinted harder, I realized that I was seeing correctly. 

The figure stepped out from the pyramid—its face was covered in 
worn, yellowed gauze. So were its arms. And its legs. 

I opened my mouth to cry out—but my voice choked in my throat. 

And as I struggled to alert my uncle, the mummy stiffly stretched out 
its arms and came staggering up behind him. 



4 


I saw Sari’s eyes grow wide with fright. She let out a low gasp. 

“Uncle Ben—!” I finally managed to scream. “Turn around! It—it—!” 

My uncle narrowed his eyes at me, confused. 

The mummy staggered closer, its hands reaching out menacingly, 
about to grab the back of Uncle Ben’s neck. 

“A mummy\” I shrieked. 

Uncle Ben spun around. He let out a startled cry. “It walks!” he 
shouted, pointing at the mummy with a trembling finger. He backed away 
as the mummy advanced. “It walks!” 

“Ohhh.” A strange moan escaped Sari’s lips. 

I turned and started to run. 

But then the mummy burst out laughing. 

It lowered its yellowed arms. “Boo!” it cried, and laughed again. 

I turned and saw that Uncle Ben was laughing, too. His dark eyes 
sparkled gleefully. “It walks! It walks!” he repeated, shaking his head. He 
put his arm around the mummy’s shoulder. 

I gaped at the two of them, my heart still pounding. 

“This is John,” Uncle Ben said, enjoying the joke he’d pulled on us. 
“He’s been doing a TV commercial here. For some new kind of stickier 
bandage.” 

“Sticky Bird Bandages,” John told us. “They’re just what your 
mummy ordered!” 

He and Uncle Ben enjoyed another good laugh at that. Then my uncle 
pointed to the camera crew, packing their equipment into a small van. 
“They finished for the day. But John agreed to hang around and help me 
scare you.” 

Sari rolled her eyes. “Nice try,” she said dryly. “You’ll have to do 
better than that, Daddy, to frighten me.” And then she added, “Poor Gabe. 
Did you see his face? He was so freaked out! I thought he was going to 
spontaneously combust or something!” 

Uncle Ben and John laughed. 

“Hey—no way!” I insisted, feeling my face turn red. 



How could Sari say that? When the mummy staggered out, I saw her 
gasp and back away. She was just as scared as I was! 

“I heard you scream, too!” I told her. I didn’t mean to sound so whiny. 

“I just did that to help them scare you,” Sari insisted. She tossed her 
long braid over her shoulder. 

“I’ve got to run,” John said, glancing at his wristwatch. “As soon as 
we get back to the hotel, I’m going to hit the pool. I may stay underwater 
for a week!” He gave us a wave of his bandaged hand and went jogging to 
the van. 

Why hadn’t I noticed that he was wearing a wristwatch? 

I felt like a total dork. “That’s it!” I cried angrily to my uncle. “I’m 
never falling for one of your dumb jokes again! Never!” 

He grinned at me and winked. “Want to bet?” 

“What about Gabe’s present?” Sari asked. “What is it?” 

Uncle Ben pulled something out of his pocket and held it up. A 
pendant on a string. Made of clear orange glass. It gleamed in the bright 
sunlight. 

He handed it to me. I moved it in my hand, feeling its smoothness as I 
examined it. “What is it?” I asked him. “What kind of glass is this?” 

“It isn’t glass,” he replied. “It’s a clear stone called amber.” He stepped 
closer to examine it along with me. “Hold it up and look inside the 
pendant.” 

I followed his instructions. I saw a large brown bug inside. “It looks 
like some kind of beetle,” I said. 

“It is a beetle,” Uncle Ben said, squinting one eye to see it better. “It’s 
an ancient beetle called a scarab. It was trapped in the amber four thousand 
years ago. As you can see, it’s perfectly preserved.” 

“That’s really gross,” Sari commented, making a face. She slapped 
Uncle Ben on the back. “Great gift, Dad. A dead bug. Remind me not to let 
you do our Christmas shopping!” 

Uncle Ben laughed. Then he turned back to me. “The scarab was very 
important to the ancient Egyptians,” he said, rolling the amber pendant in 
his fingers, then dropping it back in my palm. “They believed that scarabs 
were a symbol of immortality.” 

I stared at the bug’s dark shell, its six prickly legs, perfectly preserved. 

“To keep a scarab meant immortality,” my uncle continued. “But the 



bite of a scarab meant instant death.” 

“Weird.” Sari muttered. 

“It’s great-looking,” I told him. “Is it really four thousand years old?” 
He nodded. “Wear it around your neck, Gabe. Maybe it still has some 
of its ancient powers.” 

I slipped the pendant over my head and adjusted it under my T-shirt. 
The amber stone felt cool against my skin. “Thanks, Uncle Ben,” I said. 
“It’s a great present.” 

He mopped his sweaty forehead with a wadded-up handkerchief. 
“Let’s go back to the tent and get something cold to drink,” he said. 

We took a few steps—and then stopped when we saw Sari’s face. 

Her entire body trembled. Her mouth dropped open as she pointed to 
my chest. 

“Sari—what is it?” Uncle Ben cried. 

“The s-scarab—” she stammered. “It... escaped! I saw it!” She pointed 
down. “It’s there!” 

“Huh?” I spun away from her and bent down to find the scarab. 

“Ow!” I cried out when I felt a sharp stab of pain on the back of my 
leg. 

And realized the scarab had bitten me. 



5 


As I gasped in alarm, Uncle Ben’s words about the scarab rushed through 
my mind. 

“To keep a scarab meant immortality. But the bite of a scarab meant 
instant death. ” 

Instant death ? 

“Noooo!” I let out a howl and spun around. 

And saw Sari hunched down on her knees. Grinning. Her hand 
outstretched. 

And realized she had pinched my leg. 

My heart still pounding, I grabbed the pendant and stared into the 
orange glassy stone. The scarab was still frozen inside, just as it had been 
for four thousand years. 

“Aaaaaaaggh!” I let out a howl of rage. I was mostly furious at myself. 

Was I going to fall for every dumb joke Uncle Ben and Sari played on 
me this trip? If so, it was going to be a very long summer. 

I had always liked my cousin. Except for the times when she was 
being so competitive and so superior, we always got along really well. 

But now I wanted to punch her. I wanted to say really nasty things to 
her. 

But I couldn’t think of anything nasty enough. 

“That was really mean, Sari,” I said glumly, tucking the pendant under 
my T-shirt. 

“Yes, it was— wasn’t it!” she replied, very pleased with herself. 

That night, I lay on my back on my narrow cot, staring up at the low tent 
roof, listening. Listening to the brush of the wind against the tent door, the 
soft creak of the tent poles, the flap of the canvas. 

I don’t think I’d ever felt so alert. 

Turning my head, I could see the pale glow of moonlight through a 
crack in the tent door. I could see blades of dried desert grass on the sand 
outside. I could see water stains on the tent wall over my bed. 

I’ll never get to sleep, I thought unhappily. 



I pushed and punched the flat pillow for the twentieth time, trying to 
fluff it up. The harsh wool blanket felt scratchy against my chin. 

I’d slept away from home before. But I’d always slept in a room of 
some kind. Not in the middle of a vast, sandy desert in a tiny, flapping, 
creaking, canvas tent. 

I wasn’t scared. My uncle lay snoring away in his cot a few feet across 
the tent. 

I was just alert. Very, very alert. 

So alert I could hear the swish of palm trees outside. And I could hear 
the low hum of car tires miles away on the narrow road. 

And I heard the thudding of my heart when something wriggled on my 
chest. 

I was so alert. I felt it instantly. 

Just a tickle. A quick, light move. 

It could only be one thing. The scarab moving inside the amber 
pendant. 

No joke this time. 

No joke. It moved. 

I fumbled for the pendant in the dark, tossing down the blanket. I held 
it up to the moonlight. I could see the fat beetle in there, black in its orange 
prison. 

“Did you move?” I whispered to it. “Did you wriggle your legs?” 

I suddenly felt really stupid. Why was I whispering to a four-thousand- 
year-old insect? Why was I imagining that it was alive? 

Annoyed with myself, I tucked the pendant back under my nightshirt. 

I had no way of knowing how important that pendant would soon 
become to me. 

I had no way of knowing that the pendant held a secret that would 
either save my life. Or kill me.

The tent was already hot when I awoke the next morning. Bright yellow 
sunlight poured in through the open tent flap. Squinting against the light, I 
mbbed my eyes and stretched. Uncle Ben had already gone out. 

My back ached. The little cot was so hard! 

But I was too excited to worry about my back. I was going down into 
the pyramid this morning, to the entrance of an ancient tomb. 

I pulled on a clean T-shirt and the jeans I’d worn the day before. I 
adjusted the scarab pendant under the T-shirt. Then I carefully tucked the 
little mummy hand into the back pocket of my jeans. With the pendant and 
the mummy hand, I’m well protected, I told myself. Nothing bad can 
happen this trip. 

I pulled a hairbrush through my thick, black hair a few times, tugged 
my black-and-yellow Michigan Wolverines cap on. Then I hurried to the 
mess tent to get some breakfast. 

The sun was floating above the palm trees in the distance. The yellow 
desert sand gleamed brightly. I took a deep breath of fresh air. 

Yuck. There must be some camels nearby, I decided. The air wasn’t 
exactly fresh. 

I found Sari and Uncle Ben having their breakfast, seated at the end of 
the long table in the mess tent. Uncle Ben wore his usual baggy chinos and 
a short-sleeved, white sportshirt with coffee stains down the front. 

Sari had her long, black hair pulled straight back in a ponytail. She 
wore a bright red tank top over white tennis shorts. 

They greeted me as I entered the tent. I poured myself a glass of 
orange juice and, since I didn’t see any Frosted Flakes, filled a bowl with 
Raisin Bran. 

Three of Uncle Ben’s workers were eating at the other end of the table. 
They were talking excitedly about their work. “We could go in today,” I 
heard one of them say. 

“It might take days to break the seal on the tomb door,” a young 
woman replied. 

I sat down next to Sari. “Tell me all about the tomb,” I said to Uncle 



Ben. “Whose tomb is it? What’s in there?” 

He chuckled. “Let me say good morning before I launch into a 
lecture.” 

Sari leaned over my cereal bowl. “Hey, look—” she said, pointing. “I 
got a lot more raisins than you did!” 

I told you she could turn breakfast into a contest. 

“Well, I got more pulp in my orange juice,” I replied. 

It was just a joke, but she checked her juice glass to make sure. 

Uncle Ben wiped his mouth with a paper napkin. He took a long sip of 
black coffee. “If I’m not mistaken,” he began, “the tomb we have 
discovered here belonged to a prince. Actually, a cousin of King 
Tutankhamen.” 

“That’s King Tut,” Sari told me, interrupting. 

“I know that!” I replied sharply. 

“King Tut’s tomb was discovered in 1922,” Uncle Ben continued. 
“The vast burial chamber was filled with most of Tut’s treasures. It was the 
most amazing archaeological discovery of the century.” A smile crossed his 
face. “Until now.” 

“Do you think you’ve found something even more amazing?” I asked. 
I hadn’t touched my cereal. I was too interested in my uncle’s story. 

He shrugged. “There’s no way of knowing what’s behind the tomb 
door until we open it, Gabe. But I have my fingers crossed. I believe we’ve 
found the burial chamber of Prince Khor-Ru. He was the king’s cousin. And 
he was said to be as wealthy as the king.” 

“And do you think all of Prince Khor-Ru’s crowns, and jewels, and 
belongings are buried with him?” Sari asked. 

Uncle Ben took the last sip of coffee and slid the white mug across the 
table. “Who knows?” he replied. “There could be amazing treasures in 
there. Or it could be empty. Just an empty room.” 

“How could it be empty?” I demanded. “Why would there be an empty 
tomb in the pyramids?” 

“Grave robbers,” Uncle Ben replied, frowning. “Remember, Prince 
Khor-Ru was buried sometime around 1300 B.C. Over the centuries, 
thieves broke into the pyramids and robbed the treasures from many burial 
chambers.” 

He stood up and sighed. “We may have been digging for all these 



months only to find an empty room.” 

“No way!” I cried excitedly. “I’ll bet we find the Prince’s mummy in 
there. And millions of dollars’ worth of jewels!” 

Uncle Ben smiled at me. “Enough talk,” he said. “Finish your 
breakfast so we can go find out.” 

Sari and I followed Uncle Ben out of the tent. 

He waved to two young men who came out of the supply tent carrying 
digging equipment. Then he hurried over to talk to them. 

Sari and I lingered back. She turned to me, a serious expression on her 
face. “Hey, Gabe,” she said softly, “sorry I’ve been such a pain.” 

“You? A pain?” I replied sarcastically. 

She didn’t laugh. “I’m kind of worried,” she confessed. “About 
Daddy.” 

I glanced at Uncle Ben. He was slapping one of the young men on the 
back as he talked. His usual jolly self. 

“Why are you worried?” I asked Sari. “Your dad is in a great mood.” 

“That’s why I’m worried,” Sari whispered. “He’s so happy and 
excited. He really thinks this is going to be the discovery that makes him 
famous.” 

“So?” I demanded. 

“So what if it turns out to be an empty room?” Sari replied, her dark 
eyes watching her father. “What if grave robbers did strip the place? Or 
what if it isn’t that prince’s tomb after all? What if Daddy breaks the seal, 
opens the door—and finds nothing but a dusty, old room filled with 
snakes?” 

She sighed. “Daddy will be heartbroken. Just heartbroken. He’s 
counting on this so much, Gabe. I don’t know if he’ll be able to take the 
disappointment.” 

“Why look on the gloomy side?” I replied. “What if—” 

I stopped because Uncle Ben was hurrying back to us. “Let’s go down 
to the chamber,” he said excitedly. “The workers think we are very close to 
uncovering the tomb entrance.” 

He put an arm on each of our shoulders and guided us to the pyramid. 

As we stepped into the shade of the pyramid, the air grew cooler. The 
low entrance dug at the bottom of the back wall came into view. It was just 
big enough for us to enter one at a time. Peering into the narrow hole, I saw 



that the tunnel dropped steeply. 

I hope I don’t fall, I thought, a heavy knot of fear tightening my 
stomach. I pictured myself falling and falling down an endless, dark hole. 

Mainly, I didn’t want to fall in front of Sari. I knew she’d never let me 
forget it. 

Uncle Ben handed Sari and me bright yellow hard hats. They had 
lights built into them, like miners’ hats. “Stick close together,” he 
instructed. “I remember last summer. You two wandered off and got us into 
a lot of trouble.” 

“W-we won’t,” I stammered. I was trying not to sound nervous, but I 
couldn’t help it. 

I glanced at Sari. She was adjusting the yellow hard hat over her hair. 
She seemed as calm and confident as ever. 

“I’ll lead the way,” Uncle Ben said, pulling the chin strap under his 
chin. He turned and started to lower himself into the hole. 

But a shrill cry from behind us made us all stop and turn around. 

“Stop! Please—stop! Don’t go in!”

A young woman came running across the sand. Her long, black hair flew 
behind her head as she ran. She carried a brown briefcase in one hand. A 
camera, strapped around her neck, bobbed in front of her. 

She stopped in front of us and smiled at Uncle Ben. “Dr. Hassad?” she 
asked breathlessly. 

My uncle nodded. “Yes?” He waited for her to catch her breath. 

Wow. She’s really pretty, I thought. She had long, black hair, sleek and 
shiny. She had bangs cut straight across her forehead. Beneath the bangs 
were the most beautiful green eyes I’d ever seen. 

She was dressed all in white. A white suit jacket and a white blouse 
over white slacks. She was short—only an inch or two taller than Sari. 

She must be a movie star or something, I told myself. She’s so great¬ 
looking! 

She set her briefcase down on the sand and brushed back her long, 
black hair. “I’m sorry I shouted like that, Dr. Hassad,” she told my uncle. 
“It’s just that I needed to talk to you. I didn’t want you to disappear into the 
pyramid.” 

Uncle Ben narrowed his eyes at her, studying her. “How did you get 
past the security guard?” he asked, pulling off the hard hat. 

“I showed them my press card,” she replied. “I’m a reporter for the 
Cairo Sun. My name is Nila Rahmad. I was hoping—” 

“Nila?” Uncle Ben interrupted. “What a pretty name.” 

She smiled. “Yes. My mother named me after the River of Life, the 
Nile.” 

“Well, it’s a very pretty name,” Uncle Ben replied. His eyes twinkled. 
“But I’m not ready to have any reporters write about our work here.” 

Nila frowned and bit her lower lip. “I spoke to Dr. Fielding a few days 
ago,” she said. 

My uncle’s eyes widened in surprise. “You did?” 

“Dr. Fielding gave me permission to write about your discovery,” Nila 
insisted, her green eyes locked on my uncle. 

“Well, we haven’t discovered anything yet!” Uncle Ben said sharply. 



“There may not be anything to discover.” 

“That’s not what Dr. Fielding told me,” Nila replied. “He seemed 
confident that you were about to make a discovery that would shock the 
world.” 

Uncle Ben laughed. “Sometimes my partner gets excited and talks too 
much,” he told Nila. 

Nila’s eyes pleaded with my uncle. “May I come into the pyramid with 
you?” She glanced at Sari and me. “I see you have other visitors.” 

“My daughter, Sari, and my nephew, Gabe,” Uncle Ben replied. 

“Well, could I come down with them?” Nila pleaded. “I promise I 
won’t write a word for my paper until you give me permission.” 

Uncle Ben rubbed his chin thoughtfully. He swung the hard hat back 
onto his head. “No photographs, either,” he muttered. 

“Does that mean I can come?” Nila asked excitedly. 

Uncle Ben nodded. “As an observer.” He was trying to act real tough. 
But I could see he liked her. 

Nila flashed him a warm smile. “Thank you, Dr. Hassad.” 

He reached into the storage cart and handed her a yellow hard hat. “We 
won’t be making any amazing discoveries today,” he warned her. “But 
we’re getting very close—to something.” 

As she slipped on the heavy helmet, Nila turned to Sari and me. “Is 
this your first time in the pyramid?” she asked. 

“No way. I’ve already been down three times,” Sari boasted. “It’s 
really awesome.” 

“I just arrived yesterday,” I said. “So it’s my first time down in—” 

I stopped when I saw Nila’s expression change. 

Why was she staring at me like that? 

I glanced down and realized that she was staring at the amber pendant. 
Her mouth was open in shock. 

“No! I don’t believe this! I really don’t! This is so weird!” she 
exclaimed.

“Wh-what’s wrong?” I stammered. 

“We’re twins'.” Nila declared. She reached under her suit jacket and 
pulled out a pendant she wore around her neck. 

An amber pendant, shaped exactly like mine. 

“How unusual!” Uncle Ben exclaimed. 

Nila grasped my pendant between her fingers and lowered her face to 
examine it. “You have a scarab inside yours,” she told me, turning the 
pendant around in her fingers. 

She dropped mine and held hers up for me to see. “Look, Gabe. Mine 
is empty.” 

I gazed into her pendant. It looked like clear orange glass. Nothing 
inside. 

“I think yours is prettier,” Sari told Nila. “I wouldn’t want to wear a 
dead bug around my neck.” 

“But it’s supposed to be good luck or something,” Nila replied. She 
tucked the pendant back under her white jacket. “I hope it isn’t bad luck to 
have an empty one!” 

“I hope so, too,” Uncle Ben commented dryly. He turned and led us 
into the pyramid opening. 

I’m not really sure how I got lost. 

Sari and I were walking together behind Uncle Ben and Nila. We were 
close behind them. I could hear my uncle explaining about how the tunnel 
walls were granite and limestone. 

Our helmet lights were on. The narrow beams of yellow light darted 
and crisscrossed over the dusty tunnel floor and walls as we made our way 
deeper and deeper into the pyramid. 

The ceiling hung low, and we all had to stoop as we walked. The 
tunnel kept curving, and there were several smaller tunnels that branched 
off. “False starts and dead ends,” Uncle Ben called them. 

It was hard to see in the flickering light from our helmets. I stumbled 
once and scraped my elbow against the rough tunnel wall. It was 



surprisingly cool down here, and I wished I had worn a sweatshirt or 
something. 

Up ahead, Uncle Ben was telling Nila about King Tut and Prince 
Khor-Ru. It sounded to me as if Uncle Ben was trying to impress her. I 
wondered if he had a crush on her or something. 

“This is so thrilling!” I heard Nila exclaim. “It was so nice of Dr. 
Fielding and you to let me see it.” 

“Who is Dr. Fielding?” I whispered to Sari. 

“My father’s partner,” Sari whispered back. “But Daddy doesn’t like 
him. You’ll probably meet him. He’s always around. I don’t like him much, 
either.” 

I stopped to examine a strange-looking marking on the tunnel wall. It 
was shaped like some kind of animal head. “Sari—look!” I whispered. “An 
ancient drawing.” 

Sari rolled her eyes. “It’s Bart Simpson,” she muttered. “One of 
Daddy’s workers must have drawn it there.” 

“I knew that!” I lied. “I was just testing you.” 

When was I going to stop making a fool of myself in front of my 
cousin? 

I turned back from the stupid drawing on the wall—and Sari had 
vanished. 

I could see the narrow beam of light from her hard hat up ahead. “Hey 
—wait up!” I called. But the light disappeared as the tunnel curved away. 

And then I stumbled again. 

My helmet hit the tunnel wall. And the light went out. 

“Hey—Sari? Uncle Ben?” I called to them. I leaned heavily against the 
wall, afraid to move in the total darkness. 

“Hey—! Can anybody hear me?” My voice echoed down the narrow 
tunnel. 

But no one replied. 

I pulled off the hard hat and fiddled with the light. I turned it, trying to 
tighten it. Then I shook the whole hat. But the light wouldn’t come back on. 

Sighing, I strapped the hat back onto my head. 

Now what? I thought, starting to feel a little afraid. My stomach began 
fluttering. My throat suddenly felt dry. 

“Hey—can anybody hear me?” I shouted. “I’m in the dark back here. I 



can’t walk!” 

No reply. 

Where were they? Didn’t they notice that I had disappeared? 
“Well, I’ll just wait right here for them,” I murmured to myself. 
I leaned my shoulder against the tunnel wall— 

—and fell right through the wall. 

No way to catch my balance. Nothing to grab on to. 

I was falling, falling down through total darkness. 



9 


My hands flailed wildly as I fell. 

I reached out frantically for something to grab on to. 

It all happened too fast to cry out. 

I landed hard on my back. Pain shot out through my arms and legs. 
The darkness swirled around me. 

My breath was knocked right out of me. I saw bright flashes of red, 
then everything went black again. I struggled to breathe, but couldn’t suck 
in any air. 

I had that horrible heavy feeling in my chest, like when a basketball 
hits you in the stomach. 

Finally, I sat up, struggling to see in the total darkness. I heard a soft, 
shuffling sound. Something scraping over the hard dirt floor. 

“Hey—can anyone hear me?” My voice came out a hoarse whisper. 
Now my back ached, but I was starting to breathe normally. 

“Hey—I’m down here!” I called, a little louder. 

No reply. 

Didn’t they miss me? Weren’t they looking for me? 

I was leaning back on my hands, starting to feel better. My right hand 
started to itch. 

I reached to scratch it and brushed something away. 

And realized my legs were itching, too. And felt something crawling 
on my left wrist. 

I shook my hand hard. “What’s going on here?” I whispered to myself. 
My entire body tingled. I felt soft pinpricks up my arms and legs. 
Shaking both arms, I jumped to my feet. And banged my helmet 
against a low ledge. 

The light flickered on. 

I gasped when I saw the crawling creatures in the narrow beam of 

light. 

Spiders. Hundreds of bulby, white spiders, thick on the chamber floor. 
They scuttled across the floor, climbing over each other. As I jerked 



my head up and the light swept up with it, I saw that the stone walls were 
covered with them, too. The white spiders made the wall appear to move, as 
if it were alive. 

Spiders hung on invisible threads from the chamber ceiling. They 
seemed to bob and float in midair. 

I shook one off the back of my hand. 

And with a gasp, realized why my legs itched. Spiders were crawling 
all over them. Up over my arms. Down my back. 

“Help—somebody! Please!” I managed to cry out. 

I felt a spider drop on to the top of my head. 

I brushed it away with a frantic slap. “Somebody—help me!” I 
screamed. “Can anyone hear me?” 

And then I saw something scarier. Much scarier. A snake slid down 
from above me, lowering itself rapidly toward my face. 



10 


I ducked and tried to cover my head as the snake silently dropped toward 
me. 

“Grab it!” I heard someone call. “Grab on to it!” 

With a startled cry, I raised my eyes. The light beam followed. And I 
saw that it was not a snake that stretched from above—but a rope. 

“Grab on to it, Gabe! Hurry!” Sari shouted urgently from high above. 

Brushing away spiders, kicking frantically to shake the spiders off my 
sneakers, I grasped the rope with both hands. 

And felt myself being tugged up, pulled up through the darkness to the 
tunnel floor above. 

A few seconds later, Uncle Ben reached down and grabbed me under 
the shoulders. As he hoisted me up, I could see Sari and Nila pulling with 
all their might on the rope. 

I cheered happily as my feet touched solid ground. But I didn’t have 
long to celebrate. My entire body felt as if it were on fire! 

I went wild, kicking my legs, brushing spiders off my arms, scratching 
spiders off my back, stamping on the spiders as they scuttled off me. 

Glancing up, I saw that Sari was laughing at me. “Gabe, what do you 
call that dance?” she asked. 

Uncle Ben and Nila laughed, too. “How did you fall down there, 
Gabe?” my uncle demanded, peering down into the spider chamber. 

“The wall—it gave way,” I told him, frantically scratching my legs. 

“I thought you were still with me,” Sari explained. “When I turned 
around...” Her voice trailed off. 

The light on Uncle Ben’s helmet beamed down to the lower chamber. 
“That’s a long fall,” Uncle Ben said, turning back to me. “Are you sure 
you’re okay?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. I guess. It knocked the wind out of me. And then the 
spiders—” 

“There must be hundreds of chambers like that,” my uncle 
commented, glancing at Nila. “The pyramid builders made a maze of 
tunnels and chambers—to fool tomb robbers and keep them from finding 



the real tomb.” 

“Yuck! Such fat spiders!” Sari groaned, stepping back. 

“There are millions of them down there,” I told her. “On the walls, 
hanging from the ceiling—everywhere.” 

“This is going to give me bad dreams,” Nila said softly, moving closer 
to Uncle Ben. 

“You sure you’re okay?” my uncle demanded again. 

I started to reply. Then I suddenly remembered something. The 
mummy hand. It was tucked in my back pocket. 

Had it been crushed when I landed on it? 

My heart skipped a beat. I didn’t want anything bad to happen to that 
little hand. It was my good luck charm. 

I reached into my jeans pocket and pulled it out. Holding it under the 
light from my hard hat, I examined it carefully. 

I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that it was okay. It still felt cold. 
But it hadn’t been crushed. 

“What’s that?” Nila asked, leaning closer to see it better. She brushed 
her long hair away from her face. “Is that The Summoner?” 

“How did you know that?” I demanded, holding the hand up so she 
could see it better. 

Nila stared at it intently. “I know a lot about ancient Egypt,” she 
replied. “I’ve studied it my whole life.” 

“It might be an ancient relic,” Uncle Ben broke in. 

“Or it might just be a tacky souvenir,” Sari added. 

“It has real powers,” I insisted, brushing it off carefully. “I landed on it 
down there—” I pointed to the spider chamber—“and it didn’t get crushed.” 

“I guess it is a good luck charm,” Nila said, turning back to Uncle Ben. 

“Then why didn’t it keep Gabe from falling through that wall?” Sari 
cracked. 

Before I could answer, I saw the mummy hand move. The tiny fingers 
slowly curled. Out and then in. 

I cried out and nearly dropped it. 

“Gabe—now what?” Uncle Ben demanded sharply. 

“Uh... nothing,” I replied. 

They wouldn’t believe me anyway. 

“I think we’ve done enough exploring for now,” Uncle Ben said. 



As we made our way to the entrance, I held the mummy hand in front 
of me. 

I wasn’t seeing things. I knew that for sure. The fingers really had 
moved. 

But why? 

Was the hand trying to signal me? Was it trying to warn me about 
something? 



11 


Two days later, Uncle Ben’s workers reached the doorway to the burial 
chamber. 

Sari and I had spent the two days hanging around in the tent or 
exploring the area outside the pyramid. Since it was mostly sand, there 
wasn’t much to explore. 

We spent one long afternoon playing game after game of Scrabble. 
Playing Scrabble with Sari wasn’t much fun at all. She was a very defensive 
player and spent hours figuring out ways to clog the board and block me 
from getting any good words. 

Whenever I put down a really good word, Sari claimed it wasn’t a real 
word and couldn’t be allowed. And since we didn’t have a dictionary in the 
tent, she won most of the arguments. 

Uncle Ben, meanwhile, seemed really stressed out. I thought maybe he 
was nervous about finally opening the tomb. 

He barely spoke to Sari and me. Instead, he spent a lot of time meeting 
with people I didn’t recognize. He seemed very serious and businesslike. 
None of his usual backslapping and joking. 

Uncle Ben also spent a lot of time talking with Nila. At first, she’d said 
she wanted to write about his discovery in the pyramid. But now she’d 
decided to write an article about him. She wrote down nearly every word he 
said in a little pad she carried with her. 

Then, at breakfast, he finally smiled for the first time in two days. 
“Today’s the day,” he announced. 

Sari and I couldn’t hide our excitement. “Are you taking us with you?” 
I asked. 

Uncle Ben nodded. “I want you to be there,” he replied. “Perhaps we 
will make history today. Perhaps it will be a day you will want to remember 
for the rest of your lives.” He shrugged and added thoughtfully: “Perhaps.” 

A few minutes later, the three of us followed several workers across 
the sand toward the pyramid. It was a gray day. Heavy clouds hovered low 
in the sky, threatening rain. The pyramid rose up darkly to meet the clouds. 

As we approached the small opening in the back wall, Nila came 



running up, her camera bobbing in front of her. She wore a long-sleeved, 
blue denim work shirt over loose-fitting, faded jeans. 

Uncle Ben greeted her warmly. “But still no photographs,” he told her 
firmly. “Promise?” 

Nila smiled back at him. Her green eyes lit up excitedly. She raised a 
hand to her heart. “Promise.” 

We all took yellow hard hats from the equipment dump. Uncle Ben 
was carrying a large stone mallet. He lowered himself into the entrance, and 
we followed. 

My heart was racing as I hurried to keep up with Sari. The lights from 
our helmets darted over the narrow tunnel. Far up ahead, I could hear the 
voices of workers and the steady scrape of their digging tools. 

“This is really awesome!” I exclaimed breathlessly to Sari. 

“Maybe the tomb is filled with jewels,” Sari whispered as we made 
our way around a curve. “Sapphires and rubies and emeralds. Maybe I’ll get 
to try on a jeweled crown worn by an Egyptian princess.” 

“Do you think there’s a mummy in the tomb?” I asked. I wasn’t too 
interested in jewels. “Do you think the mummified body of Prince Khor-Ru 
is lying there, waiting to be discovered?” 

Sari made a disgusted face. “Is that all you can think about— 
mummies?” 

“Well, we are in an ancient Egyptian pyramid!” I shot back. 

“There could be millions of dollars’ worth of jewels and relics in that 
tomb,” Sari scolded. “And all you can think about is some moldy old body 
wrapped up in tar and gauze.” She shook her head. “You know, most kids 
get over their fascination with mummies by the time they’re eight or nine.” 

“Uncle Ben didn’t!” I replied. 

That shut her up. 

We followed Nila and Uncle Ben in silence. After a while, the narrow 
tunnel curved up sharply. The air grew warmer as we followed it up. 

I could see lights ahead. Two battery-powered spotlights were trained 
on the far wall. As we drew closer, I realized it wasn’t a wall. It was a door. 

Four workers—two men and two women—were on their knees, 
working with small shovels and picks. They were scraping the last chunks 
of dirt away from the door. 

“It looks beautiful!” Uncle Ben cried, running up to the workers. They 



turned to greet him. “It’s awesome in the true sense of the word!” he 
declared. 

Nila, Sari, and I stepped up behind him. Uncle Ben was right. The 
ancient door really was awesome! 

It wasn’t very tall. I could see that Uncle Ben would have to stoop to 
step into it. But it looked like a door fit for a prince. 

The dark mahogany wood—now petrified—must have been brought 
from far away. I knew that kind of wood didn’t come from any trees that 
grew in Egypt. 

Strange hieroglyphics covered the door from top to bottom. I 
recognized birds, and cats, and other animals etched deeply into the dark 
wood. 

The most startling sight of all was the seal that locked the door—a 
snarling lion’s head, sculpted in gold. The light from the spotlights made 
the lion glow like the sun. 

“The gold is soft,” I heard one of the workers tell my uncle. “The seal 
will break away easily.” 

Uncle Ben lowered his heavy mallet to the ground. He stared for a 
long moment at the glowing lion’s head, then turned back to us. “They 
thought this lion would scare any intruders away from the tomb,” he 
explained. “I guess it worked. Till now.” 

“Dr. Hassad, I have to photograph the actual breaking of the seal,” 
Nila said, stepping up beside him. “You really must let me. We can’t let the 
moment go unrecorded.” 

He gazed at her thoughtfully. “Well... okay,” he agreed. 

A pleased smile crossed her face as she raised her camera. “Thanks, 
Ben.” 

The workers stepped back. One of them handed Uncle Ben a hammer 
and a delicate tool that looked like a doctor’s scalpel. “It’s all yours, Dr. 
Hassad,” she said. 

Uncle Ben raised the tools and stepped up to the seal. “Once I break 
this seal, we will open the door and step into a room that hasn’t been seen in 
four thousand years,” he announced. 

Nila steadied her camera over her eye, carefully adjusting the lens. 

Sari and I moved up beside the workers. 

The gold lion appeared to glow brighter as Uncle Ben raised the tool. 



A hush fell over the tunnel. I could feel the excitement, feel the tension in 
the air. 

Such suspense! 

I realized I had been holding my breath. I let it out in a long, silent 
whoosh and took another. 

I glanced at Sari. She was nervously chewing her lower lip. Her hands 
were pressed tightly at her sides. 

“Anyone hungry? Maybe we should forget about this and send out for 
a pizza!” Uncle Ben joked. 

We all laughed loudly. 

That was Uncle Ben for you—cracking a dumb joke at what might be 
the most exciting moment of his life. 

The tense silence returned. Uncle Ben’s expression turned serious. He 
turned back to the ancient seal. He raised the small chisel to the back of the 
seal. Then he started to lift the hammer. 

And a booming voice rang out, “PLEASE—LET ME REST IN 
PEACE!” 



12 


I let out a startled cry. 

“LET ME REST IN PEACE!” the booming voice repeated. 

I saw Uncle Ben lower his chisel. He spun around, his eyes wide with 
surprise. 

I realized the voice came from behind us. I turned to see a man I had 
never seen before, half hidden in the shadowy tunnel. He made his way 
toward us, taking long, steady strides. 

He was a tall, lanky man, so tall he really had to hunch his shoulders in 
the low tunnel. Bald except for a fringe of dark hair at the ears, he had a 
slender face, an unfriendly scowl on his thin lips. 

He wore a perfectly ironed safari jacket over a shirt and necktie. His 
black eyes, like little raisins, glared at my uncle. I wondered if the man ever 
ate. He was as skinny as a mummy himself! 

“Omar—!” Uncle Ben started. “I wasn’t expecting you back from 
Cairo.” 

“Let me rest in peace,” Dr. Fielding repeated, softer this time. “Those 
are the words of Prince Khor-Ru. Written on the ancient stone we found last 
month. That was the prince’s wish.” 

“Omar, we’ve been over this before,” my uncle replied, sighing. He 
lowered the hammer and chisel to his sides. 

Dr. Fielding pushed past Sari and me as if we weren’t there. He 
stopped in front of my uncle and swept a hand back over his bald head. 
“Well, then, how can you dare to break the seal?” Dr. Fielding demanded. 

“I am a scientist,” my uncle replied slowly, speaking each word clearly 
and distinctly. “I cannot allow superstition to stand in the way of discovery, 
Omar.” 

“I am also a scientist,” Dr. Fielding replied, using both hands to tighten 
his necktie. “But I am not willing to defile this ancient tomb. I am not 
willing to go against the wishes of Prince Khor-Ru. And I am not willing to 
call the words of the hieroglyph mere superstition.” 

“This is where we disagree,” Uncle Ben said softly. He motioned to 
the four workers. “We have spent too many months, too many years, to stop 



just outside the door. We have come this far, Omar. We must go the rest of 
the way.” 

Dr. Fielding chewed his lower lip. He pointed to the top of the door. 
“Look, Ben. There are the same hieroglyphs as on the stone. The same 
warning. Let me rest in peace. ” 

“I know, I know,” my uncle said, frowning. 

“The warning is very clear,” Dr. Fielding continued heatedly, his tiny 
raisin eyes narrowed at my uncle. “If anyone should disturb the prince, if 
anyone should repeat the ancient words written on the tomb five times—the 
mummified prince shall come to life. And he shall seek his vengeance on 
those who disturbed him.” 

Listening to those words made me shudder. I stared hard at Uncle Ben. 
Why hadn’t he ever told Sari and me about the prince’s threat? Why hadn’t 
he ever mentioned the words of warning they had found on an ancient 
stone? 

Was he afraid he might frighten us? 

Was he frightened himself? 

No. No way. 

He didn’t seem at all frightened now as he argued with Dr. Fielding. I 
could tell they had had this argument before. And I could see there was no 
way that Dr. Fielding was going to stop my uncle from breaking the seal 
and entering the tomb. 

“This is my final warning, Ben—” Dr. Fielding said. “For the sake of 
everyone here...” He motioned with one hand to the four workers. 

“Superstition,” Uncle Ben replied. “I cannot be stopped by 
superstition. I am a scientist.” He raised the chisel and hammer. “The seal 
will be broken.” 

Dr. Fielding tossed up both hands in disgust. “I will not be a party to 
this,” he declared. He spun around, nearly hitting his head on the tunnel 
ceiling. Then, muttering to himself, he hurried away, disappearing quickly 
into the darkness of the tunnel. 

Uncle Ben took a couple of steps after him. “Omar—? Omar?” 

But we could hear Dr. Fielding’s footsteps growing fainter as he made 
his way out of the pyramid. 

Uncle Ben sighed and leaned close to me. “I don’t trust that man,” he 
muttered. “He doesn’t really care about the old superstitions. He wants to 



steal this discovery for himself. That’s why he tried to make me stop 
outside the door.” 

I didn’t know how to reply. My uncle’s words startled me. I thought 
scientists had rules about who took credit for what discoveries. 

Uncle Ben whispered something to Nila. Then he made his way back 
to the four workers. “If any of you agree with Dr. Fielding,” he told them, 
“you are free to leave now.” 

The workers exchanged glances with one another. 

“You have all heard the words of warning on the tomb door. I do not 
want to force anyone to enter the tomb,” Uncle Ben told them. 

“But we have worked so hard,” one of the men said. “We cannot stop 
here. We have no choice. We have to open that door.” 

A smile crossed my uncle’s face. “I agree,” he said, turning back to the 
lion seal. 

I glanced at Sari and realized that she was already staring at me. 
“Gabe, if you’re scared, Daddy will let you leave,” she whispered. “You 
don’t have to be embarrassed.” 

She never quits! 

“I’m staying,” I whispered back. “But if you want me to walk you 
back to the tent, I will.” 

A loud clink made us both turn back to the door. Uncle Ben was 
working to pry off the gold lion seal. Nila had her camera poised. The 
workers stood tensely, watching Uncle Ben’s every move. 

Uncle Ben worked slowly, carefully. He slid the chisel behind the 
ancient seal and gently pried and scraped. 

A few minutes later, the seal fell into my uncle’s hands. Nila busily 
snapped photograph after photograph. Uncle Ben carefully passed it to one 
of the workers. “That’s not a Christmas gift,” he joked. “I’m keeping that 
for my mantelpiece! ” 

Everyone laughed. 

Uncle Ben gripped the edge of the door with both hands. “I’m going in 
first,” he announced. “If I’m not back in twenty minutes, go tell Dr. 
Fielding he was right!” 

More laughter. 

Two of the workers moved to help Uncle Ben slide open the door. 
They pressed their shoulders against it, straining hard. 



The door didn’t budge. 

“It might need a little oiling,” Uncle Ben joked. “After all, it’s been 
closed for four thousand years.” 

They worked for several minutes with picks and chisels, carefully 
freeing the door. Then they tried once again, pressing their shoulders 
against the heavy mahogany door. 

“Yes!” Uncle Ben cried out as the door slid an inch. 

Then another inch. Another inch. 

Everyone pressed forward, eager to get a view of the ancient tomb. 

Two of the workers moved the large spotlights, aiming them into the 
doorway. 

As Uncle Ben and his two helpers pushed against the door, Sari and I 
stepped up beside Nila. “Isn’t this amazing!” Nila cried excitedly. “I can’t 
believe I’m the only reporter here! I’m so lucky!” 

I’m lucky, too, I realized. How many kids would give anything to be 
standing right where I am? How many kids would love to be one of the first 
people in the world to step into a four-thousand-year-old tomb in an 
Egyptian pyramid? 

The faces of some of my friends back home suddenly popped into my 
mind. I realized I couldn’t wait to tell them about my adventure here! 

The door scraped noisily against the dirt floor. Another inch. Another 

inch. 

The opening was almost big enough for a person to squeeze through. 

“Move the light a little,” Uncle Ben instructed. “Another few inches, 
and we can go in and shake hands with the prince.” 

The door scraped open another inch. With a great heave, Uncle Ben 
and his helpers forced it open another few inches. 

“Yes!” he cried happily. 

Nila snapped a photograph. 

We all pressed forward eagerly. 

Uncle Ben slid through the opening first. 

Sari bumped me out of the way and cut in front of me. 

My heart was pounding hard. My hands were suddenly ice cold. 

I didn’t care who went in first. I just wanted to go in! 

One by one, we slipped into the ancient chamber. 

Finally, my turn came. I took a deep breath, slipped through the 



opening, and saw— 

—nothing. 

Except for a lot of cobwebs, the chamber was bare. 
Totally bare. 



13 


I let out a long sigh. Poor Unde Ben. All that work for nothing. I felt so 
disappointed. 

I glanced around the bare chamber. The spotlights made the thick 
cobwebs glow like silver. Our shadows stretched across the dirt floor like 
ghosts. 

I turned to Uncle Ben, expecting him to be disappointed, too. But to 
my surprise, he had a smile on his face. “Move the lights,” he told one of 
the workers. “And bring the tools. We have another seal to remove.” 

He pointed across the empty room to the back wall. In the gray light, I 
could make out the outline of a door. Another sculpted lion sealed it shut. 

“I knew this wasn’t the real burial chamber!” Sari cried, grinning at 
me. 

“As I said, the Egyptians often did this,” Uncle Ben explained. “They 
built several false chambers to hide the real chamber from grave robbers.” 
He pulled off his hard hat and scratched his hair. “In fact,” he continued, 
“we may find several empty chambers before we find Prince Khor-Ru’s 
resting place.” 

Nila snapped a photo of Uncle Ben examining the newly discovered 
door. She smiled at me. “You should have seen the expression on your face, 
Gabe,” she said. “You looked so disappointed.” 

“I thought—” I started. But the scrape of Uncle Ben’s chisel against 
the seal made me stop. 

We all turned to watch him work at the seal. Staring across the 
cobweb-filled chamber, I tried to imagine what waited for us on the other 
side of the door. 

Another empty chamber? Or a four-thousand-year-old Egyptian prince, 
surrounded by all of his treasures and belongings? 

Work on the door went slowly. We all broke for lunch and then 
returned. That afternoon Uncle Ben and his helpers worked for another 
couple of hours, carefully trying to remove the seal without damaging it. 

As they worked, Sari and I sat on the floor and watched. The air was 
hot and kind of sour. I guess it was ancient air. Sari and I talked about last 



summer and the adventures we’d had in the Great Pyramid. Nila snapped 
our picture. 

“Almost got it,” Uncle Ben announced. 

We all started to get excited again. Sari and I climbed to our feet and 
crossed the room to get a better view. 

The lion seal slid free from the door. Two of the workers placed it 
gently into a padded crate. Then Uncle Ben and the other two workers set to 
work pushing open the door. 

This door proved even more difficult than the last. “It’s... really... 
stuck,” Uncle Ben groaned. He and the workers pulled out more tools and 
began prying and chipping away the hard crust that had formed on the 
doorway over the centuries. 

An hour later, they got the door to slide an inch. Then another inch. 
Another. 

When it had slid halfway open, Uncle Ben removed the light from his 
helmet and beamed it through the opening. He peered into the next chamber 
for the longest time without saying a word. 

Sari and I moved closer. My heart began racing again. 

What did he see? I wondered. What was he staring at so silently? 

Finally, Uncle Ben lowered the light and turned back to us. “We’ve 
made a big mistake,” he said quietly. 



14 


A shocked silence fell over the room. I swallowed hard, stunned by my 
uncle’s words. 

But then a broad smile crossed his face. “We made a mistake by 
underestimating our discovery!” he exclaimed. “This will be more 
important than the discovery of King Tut! This tomb is even grander!” 

A gleeful cheer echoed against the stone walls. The workers rushed 
forward to shake Uncle Ben’s hand and offer their congratulations. 

“Congratulations to us all!” Uncle Ben declared happily. 

We were all laughing and talking excitedly as we slipped through the 
narrow opening, into the next chamber. 

As the lights beamed over the vast room, I knew I was seeing 
something I would never forget. Even the thick layer of dust and cobwebs 
could not cover the amazing treasures that filled the chamber. 

My eyes darted quickly around. I struggled to focus on it all. But there 
was too much to see! I actually felt dizzy. 

The walls were covered from floor to ceiling with hieroglyphics, 
etched into the stone. The floor was cluttered with furniture and other 
objects. It looked more like someone’s attic or a storeroom than a tomb! 

A tall, straight-backed throne caught my eye. It had a golden, radiating 
sun etched into the seat-back. Behind it, I saw chairs and benches, and a 
long couch. 

Against the wall were stacked dozens of stone and clay jars. Some 
were cracked and broken. But many were in perfect condition. 

A gold monkey head lay on its side in the middle of the floor. Behind 
it, I saw several large chests. 

Uncle Ben and one of the workers carefully pulled back the lid of one 
of the chests. Their eyes grew wide as they gaped inside. 

“Jewelry!” Uncle Ben declared. “It’s filled with gold jewelry!” 

Sari came up beside me, an excited grin on her face. 

“This is awesomel” I whispered. 

She nodded agreement. “Awesome!” 

We whispered in the heavy silence. No one else talked. Everyone was 



too overwhelmed by the amazing sight. The loudest sound was the clicking 
of Nila’s camera. 

Uncle Ben stepped between Sari and me and placed a hand on our 
shoulders. “Isn’t this unbelievable?” he cried. “It’s all in perfect condition. 
Untouched for four thousand years.” 

When I glanced up at him, I saw that he had tears in his eyes. This is 
the greatest moment of Uncle Ben’s life, I realized. 

“We must be very careful—” Uncle Ben started. But he stopped in 
midsentence, and I saw his expression change. 

As he guided Sari and me across the room, I saw what he was staring 
at. A large stone mummy case, hidden in shadow, stood against the far wall. 

“Oh, wow!” I murmured as we stepped up to it. 

Made of smooth, gray stone, the heavy lid had a long crack down the 
center. 

“Is the prince buried inside it?” Sari asked eagerly. 

It took Uncle Ben a moment to reply. He stood between us, his eyes 
locked on the ancient mummy case. “We’ll soon see,” he finally replied. 

As he and the four workers struggled to move the lid, Nila lowered her 
camera and stepped forward to watch. Her green eyes stared intensely as 
the lid slowly slid away. 

Inside was a coffin in the shape of the mummy. It wasn’t very long. 
And it was narrower than I thought it would be. 

The workers slowly pried open the coffin’s lid. I gasped and grabbed 
Uncle Ben’s hand as the mummy was revealed. 

It looked so tiny and frail! 

“Prince Khor-Ru,” Uncle Ben muttered, staring down into the stone 

case. 

The prince lay on his back, his slender arms crossed over his chest. 
Black tar had seeped through the bandages. The gauze had worn away from 
the head, revealing the tar-covered skull. 

As I leaned over the case, my heart in my throat, the tar-blackened 
eyes seemed to stare helplessly up at me. 

There’s a real person inside there, I thought, feeling a chill run down 
my spine. He’s about my size. And he died. And they covered him with hot 
tar and cloth. And he’s been lying in this case for four thousand years. 

A real person. A royal prince. 



I stared at the stained, cracked tar that covered his face. At the 
gauzelike cloth, all frayed and yellowed. At the stiff body, so frail and 
small. 

He was alive once, I thought. Did he ever dream that four thousand 
years later, people would open his coffin and stare at him? Stare at his 
mummified body? 

I took a step back to catch my breath. It was too exciting. 

I saw that Nila also had tears in her eyes. She rested both hands on the 
edge of the case and leaned over the prince’s body, her eyes locked on the 
blackened face. 

“These may be the best-preserved remains ever found,” Uncle Ben 
said quietly. “Of course we will have to do many tests to determine the 
young man’s identity. But, judging from everything else in this chamber, I 
think it’s safe to say...” 

His voice trailed off as we all heard sounds from the outer chamber. 
Footsteps. Voices. 

I spun around toward the doorway as four black-uniformed police 
officers burst into the room. “Okay. Everybody take one step back,” one of 
them ordered, lowering his hand to the gun holster at his side. 



15 


Startled cries filled the room. Uncle Ben spun around, his eyes wide with 
surprise. “What is happening?” he cried. 

The four Cairo police officers, their features set in hard frowns, moved 
quickly into the center of the room. 

“Be careful!” Uncle Ben warned, standing in front of the mummy case 
as if protecting it. “Do not move anything. It is all terribly fragile.” 

He pulled off the hard hat. His eyes went from officer to officer. “What 
are you doing here?” 

“I asked them to come,” a voice boomed from the doorway. 

Dr. Fielding entered, a pleased expression on his face. His tiny eyes 
danced excitedly. 

“Omar—I don’t understand,” Uncle Ben said, taking a few steps 
toward the other scientist. 

“I thought it best to protect the contents of the room,” Dr. Fielding 
replied. He gazed quickly around the room, taking in the treasures. 

“Wonderful! This is wonderful!” he cried. He stepped forward and 
shook my uncle’s hand enthusiastically. “Congratulations, everyone!” he 
boomed. “This is almost too much to believe.” 

Uncle Ben’s expression softened. “I still do not understand the need 
for them,” he said, motioning to the grim-faced officers. “No one in this 
room is about to steal anything.” 

“Certainly not,” Dr. Fielding replied, still squeezing Uncle Ben’s hand. 
“Certainly not. But word will soon get out, Ben. And I thought we should 
be prepared to guard what we have found.” 

Uncle Ben eyed the four officers suspiciously. But then he shrugged 
his broad shoulders. “Perhaps you are right,” he told Dr. Fielding. “Perhaps 
you are being smart.” 

“Just ignore them,” Dr. Fielding replied. He slapped my uncle on the 
back. “I owe you an apology, Ben. I was wrong to try to stop you before. As 
a scientist, I should have known better. We owed it to the world to open this 
tomb. I hope you’ll forgive me. We have much to celebrate—don’t we!” 



* * * 


“I don’t trust him,” Uncle Ben confided that evening as we walked from the 
tent to dinner. “I don’t trust my partner at all.” 

It was a clear night, surprisingly cool. The purple sky was dotted with 
a million twinkling white stars. A steady breeze made the palm trees sway 
on the horizon. The big campfire up ahead dipped and shifted with the 
wind. 

“Is Dr. Fielding coming with us to dinner?” Sari asked. She wore a 
pale green sweater, pulled down over black leggings. 

Uncle Ben shook his head. “No, he hurried to phone Cairo. I think he’s 
eager to tell our backers the good news.” 

“He seemed really excited when he saw the mummy and everything,” I 
said, glancing at the pyramid rising darkly to the evening sky. 

“Yes, he did,” my uncle admitted. “He certainly changed his mind in a 
hurry! But I’m keeping my eye on him. Omar would like nothing better 
than to take over the project. I’m going to keep an eye on those police 
officers of his, too.” 

“Daddy, this should be a happy night,” Sari scolded. “Let’s not talk 
about Dr. Fielding. Let’s just talk about Prince Khor-Ru and how you’re 
going to be rich and famous!” 

Uncle Ben laughed. “It’s a deal,” he told her. 

Nila waited for us by the campfire. Uncle Ben had invited her to join 
us for a barbecue. She wore a white sweatshirt over loose-fitting jeans. Her 
amber pendant caught the light from the half-moon, just rising over the 
tents. 

She looked really pretty. She flashed Uncle Ben a warm smile as we 
came near. I could tell by his face that he liked her. 

“Sari, you’re taller than Gabe, aren’t you!” Nila commented. 

Sari grinned. She loved being taller than me, even though I’m a little 
older. 

“Less than an inch,” I said quickly. 

“People are definitely getting taller,” Nila said, to my uncle. “Prince 
Khor-Ru was so short. He’d be a midget today!” 

“It makes you wonder why such short people built such tall pyramids,” 
Uncle Ben said, grinning. 



Nila smiled and took his arm. 

Sari and I exchanged glances. I could see what Sari was thinking. Her 
expression said: What’s up with those two? 

We had a great dinner. Uncle Ben burned the hamburger rolls a little. 
But no one really minded. 

Sari downed two hamburgers. I could only eat one. That gave her 
something else to boast about. 

I was really getting fed up with my bragging cousin. I found myself 
trying to think of a way to get back at her. 

Nila and Uncle Ben kidded around a lot. 

“That burial chamber looked like a movie set,” Nila teased my uncle. 
“It was all too perfect. All that gold. And that perfect little mummy. It’s all 
a fake. That’s what I’m going to write in my article.” 

Uncle Ben laughed. He turned to me. “Did you check out the mummy, 
Gabe? Was this one wearing a wristwatch?” 

I shook my head. “No wristwatch.” 

“See?” Uncle Ben told Nila. “No wristwatch. So it’s got to be real!” 

“I guess that proves it,” Nila said, smiling warmly at my uncle. 

“Daddy, do you know the words to bring the mummy to life?” Sari 
broke in. “You know. The words on the tomb that Dr. Fielding was talking 
about?” 

Uncle Ben swallowed the last bite of his hamburger. He wiped the 
grease off his chin with a napkin. “I can’t believe that a serious scientist 
would believe such superstition,” he murmured. 

“But what are the six words to bring the mummy to life?” Nila 
demanded. “Come on, Ben. Tell us.” 

Uncle Ben’s smile faded. He shook his finger at Nila. “Oh, no!” he 
declared. “I don’t trust you. If I tell you the words, you’ll bring the mummy 
back to fife just to get a good photograph for your newspaper!” 

We all laughed. 

We were sitting around the campfire, its orange light flickering over 
our faces. Uncle Ben set his plate down on the ground and spread his hands 
over the fire. 

“Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki Khari!” he chanted in a deep voice, 
waving his hands over the flames. 

The fire crackled. A twig made a loud popping sound that made my 



heart skip a beat. 

“Are those the secret words?” Sari demanded. 

Uncle Ben nodded solemnly. “Those are the words of the hieroglyphs 
over the entrance to the tomb.” 

“So maybe the mummy just sat up and stretched?” Sari asked. 

“I’d be very surprised,” Uncle Ben replied, climbing to his feet. 
“You’re forgetting, Sari—you have to chant the words five times.” 

“Oh.” Sari stared thoughtfully into the fire. 

I repeated the words in my mind. “Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki 
Khari! ” I needed to memorize the words. I had a plan to scare Sari. 

“Where are you going?” Nila asked my uncle. 

“To the communications tent,” he replied. “I have to make a phone 
call.” He turned and made his way quickly over the sand toward the row of 
canvas tents. 

Nila let out a surprised laugh. “He didn’t even say goodnight.” 

“Daddy’s always like that,” Sari explained, “when he has something 
on his mind.” 

“Guess I’d better go, too,” Nila said, climbing to her feet and brushing 
sand off her jeans. “I’m going to start writing my story for the paper.” 

She said good night and walked quickly away, her sandals making a 
slapping sound against the sand. 

Sari and I sat staring into the crackling fire. The half-moon had floated 
high in the sky. Its pale light reflected off the top of the pyramid in the 
distance. 

“Nila is right,” I told Sari. “It really did look like a movie set in there.” 

Sari didn’t reply. She stared into the fire without blinking, thinking 
hard. Something in the fire popped again. The sound seemed to snap her out 
of her thoughts. 

“Do you think Nila likes Daddy?” she asked me, her dark eyes locking 
on mine. 

“Yeah, I guess,” I replied. “She’s always giving him this smile.” I 
imitated Nila’s smile. “And she’s always kind of teasing him.” 

Sari thought about my reply. “And do you think Daddy likes her?” 

I grinned. “For sure.” I stood up. I was eager to get back to the tent. I 
wanted to scare Sari. 

We walked toward the tents in silence. I guessed that Sari was still 



thinking about her dad and Nila. 

The night air was cool, but it was warm inside the tent. Moonlight 
filtered through the canvas. Sari pulled her trunk out from under her cot and 
got down on her knees to search through her clothes. 

“Sari,” I whispered. “Dare me to recite the ancient words five times?” 

“Huh?” She gazed up from the trunk. 

“I’m going to chant the words five times,” I told her. “You know. See 
if anything happens.” 

I expected her to beg me not to. I expected her to get scared and plead: 
“Please, Gabe—don’t do it! Don’t! It’s too dangerous!” 

But, instead, Sari turned back to her clothes trunk. “Hey. Give it a try,” 
she told me. 

“You sure?” I asked her. 

“Yeah. Why not?” she replied, pulling out a pair of denim cutoffs. 

I stared across the tent at her. Was that fear I saw in her eyes? Was she 
just pretending to be so casual about it? 

Yes. I think Sari was a little scared. And trying hard not to show it. 

I took a few steps closer and chanted the ancient words, in the same 
low voice Uncle Ben had used: “Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki Khari!” 

Sari dropped the jeans and turned to watch me. 

I repeated the chant a second time: “Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki 
Khari!” 

A third time. 

A fourth time. 

I hesitated. I felt a cold breeze tingle the back of my neck. 

Should I chant the words again? Should I go for number five? 



16 


I stared down at Sari. 

She had closed the trunk lid and was leaning on it tensely, staring back 
at me. I could see that she was frightened. She chewed her bottom lip. 

Should I chant the words for a fifth time? 

I felt another chill at the back of my neck. 

It’s just superstition, I told myself. Four-thousand-year-old 
superstition. 

There’s no way that moldy, old mummified prince is going to come 
back to life just because I recite six words I don’t even know the meaning 
of! 

No way. 

I suddenly thought of all the old movies I had rented about mummies 
in ancient Egypt. In the movies, the scientists always ignored ancient curses 
warning them not to disturb the mummies’ tombs. Then the mummies 
always came to life to get their revenge. They staggered around, grabbed 
the scientists by the throat, and strangled them. 

Dumb movies. But I loved them. 

Now, staring down at Sari, I saw that she was really scared. 

I took a deep breath. I suddenly realized that I felt scared, too. 

But it was too late. I had gone too far. I couldn’t chicken out now. 

“Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki Khari!” I shouted. The fifth time. 

I froze—and waited. I don’t know what I expected. A flash of 
lightning, maybe. 

Sari climbed to her feet. She tugged at a strand of dark hair. 

“Admit it. You’re totally freaked,” I said, unable to keep a grin from 
spreading across my face. 

“No way!” she insisted. “Go ahead, Gabe. Chant the words again. 
Chant them a hundred times! You’re not going to scare me! No way!” 

But we both gasped when we suddenly saw a dark shadow roll over 
the tent wall. 

And my heart completely stopped when a hoarse voice whispered into 
the tent: “Areyou in there?” 



17 


My legs trembled as I stumbled back, closer to Sari. 

I could see her eyes go wide with surprise—and fear. 

The shadow moved quickly toward the tent opening. 

We had no time to scream. No time to call for help. 

Gaping into the darkness, I saw the flap pull open—and a smooth head 
poked into the tent. 

“Ohhh.” I let out a terrified moan as the dark figure slumped toward 
us. 

The mummy is alive! The horrifying thought swept through my mind 
as I backed away. The mummy is alive! 

“Dr. Fielding!” Sari cried. 

“Huh?” I squinted to see better. 

Yes. It was Dr. Fielding. 

I struggled to say hello. But my heart was pounding so hard, I couldn’t 
speak. I took a long, deep breath and held it. 

“I’m looking for your father,” Dr. Fielding told Sari. “I must see him at 
once. It’s extremely urgent.” 

“He—he’s making a phone call,” Sari replied in a shaky voice. 

Dr. Fielding spun around and ducked out of the tent. The flap snapped 
shut behind him. 

I turned to Sari, my heart still pounding. “He scared me to death!” I 
confessed. “I thought he was in Cairo. When he poked that skinny, bald 
head into the tent...” 

Sari laughed. “He really looks like a mummy—doesn’t he?” Her smile 
faded. “I wonder why he’s in such a hurry to see Daddy.” 

“Let’s follow him!” I urged. The idea just popped into my head. 

“Yes! Let’s go!” I hadn’t expected Sari to agree so quickly. But she 
was already pushing open the tent flap. 

I followed her out of the tent. The night had grown cooler. A steady 
wind made all of the tents appear to shiver. 

“Which way did he go?” I whispered. 



Sari pointed. “I think that’s the communications tent at the end.” She 
started jogging across the sand. 

As we ran, the wind blew sand against our legs. I heard music and 
voices from one of the tents. The workers were celebrating the day’s 
discovery. 

The moon cast a strip of light like a carpet along our path. Up ahead, I 
could see Dr. Fielding’s lanky body, leaning forward, lurching awkwardly 
toward the last tent. 

He disappeared around the side of it. Sari and I stopped a few tents 
away. We ducked out of the moonlight, into deep shadows where we 
wouldn’t be seen. 

I could hear Dr. Fielding’s booming voice from the communications 
tent. He was talking rapidly, excitedly. 

“What is he saying?” Sari whispered. 

I couldn’t make out the words. 

A few seconds later, two figures emerged from the tent. Carrying 
bright flashlights, they crossed the strip of yellow moonlight, then moved 
quickly into shadow. 

Dr. Fielding appeared to be pulling Uncle Ben, pulling him toward the 
pyramid. 

“What’s going on?” Sari whispered, grabbing my sleeve. “Is he forcing 
Daddy to go with him?” 

The wind swirled the sand around us. I shivered. 

The two men were talking at the same time, shouting and gesturing 
with their flashlights. They’re arguing about something, I realized. 

Dr. Fielding had a hand on Uncle Ben’s shoulder. Was he shoving 
Uncle Ben toward the pyramid? Or was Uncle Ben actually leading the 
way? 

It was impossible to tell. 

“Let’s go,” I whispered to Sari. 

We stepped away from the tent and started to follow them. We walked 
slowly, keeping them in view, but being careful not to get too close. 

“If they turn back, they’ll see us,” Sari whispered, huddling close to 
me as we crept over the sand. 

She was right. There were no trees or bushes to hide behind here in the 
open desert. 



“Maybe they won’t turn back,” I replied hopefully. 

We crept closer. The pyramid rose up darkly in front of us. 

We saw Dr. Fielding and Uncle Ben stop at the opening in the side. I 
could hear their excited voices, but the wind carried away their words. They 
still seemed to be arguing. 

Uncle Ben disappeared into the pyramid first. Dr. Fielding went in 
right behind him. 

“Did he shove Daddy in?” Sari demanded in a shrill, frightened voice. 
“It looked like he pushed him inside!” 

“I—I don’t know,” I stammered. 

We made our way closer to the entrance. Then we both stopped and 
stared into the darkness. 

I knew we were both thinking the same thing. I knew we both had the 
same question on our lips: 

Should we follow them in? 



18 


Sari and I exchanged glances. 

The pyramid seemed so much bigger at night, so much darker. The 
gusting wind howled around its walls, as if warning us to stay back. 

We crept behind a pile of stones left by the workers. “Let’s wait out 
here for Daddy to come out,” Sari suggested. 

I didn’t argue with her. We had no flashlights, no light of any kind. I 
didn’t think we’d get very far wandering the dark tunnels by ourselves. 

I pressed up against the smooth stones and stared at the pyramid 
opening. Sari gazed up at the half-moon. Thin wisps of cloud floated over 
it. The ground darkened in front of us. 

“You don’t think Daddy is in any kind of trouble, do you?” Sari asked. 
“I mean, he told us he didn’t trust Dr. Fielding. And then—” 

“I’m sure Uncle Ben is okay,” I told her. “I mean, Dr. Fielding is a 
scientist. He’s not a criminal or anything.” 

“But why did he force Daddy into the pyramid in the middle of the 
night?” Sari asked shrilly. “And what were they arguing about?” 

I shrugged in reply. I didn’t remember ever seeing Sari so frightened. 
Normally, I would have enjoyed it. She always bragged about how brave 
and fearless she was—especially compared to me. 

But there was no way I could enjoy this. Mainly because I was just as 
scared as she was! 

It did look as if the two scientists were fighting. And it did look as if 
Dr. Fielding pushed Uncle Ben down into the pyramid. 

Sari crossed her arms over her sweater again and narrowed her eyes at 
the opening. The wind fluttered her hair, blowing strands across her 
forehead. But she made no attempt to brush them away. 

“What could be so important?” she demanded. “Why did they have to 
go into the pyramid now? Do you think something was stolen? Aren’t those 
police officers from Cairo down there guarding the place?” 

“I saw the four policemen leave,” I told her. “They piled into their 
little car and drove away, just before dinner. I don’t know why. Maybe they 
were called back to the city.” 



“I—I’m just so confused,” Sari admitted. “And worried. I didn’t like 
the look on Dr. Fielding’s face. I didn’t like the way he was so rude, just 
bursting into the tent like that. Scaring us to death. Not even saying hi.” 

“Calm down, Sari,” I said softly. “Let’s just wait. Everything will be 
okay.” 

She let out a sigh, but didn’t say anything in reply. 

We waited in silence. I don’t know how much time went by. It seemed 
like hours and hours. 

The slivers of cloud drifted away from the moon. The wind continued 
to howl eerily around the side of the pyramid. 

“Where are they? What are they doing in there?” Sari demanded. 

I started to reply—but stopped when I saw a flicker of light at the 
pyramid opening. 

I grabbed Sari’s arm. “Look—!” I whispered. 

The light grew brighter. A figure emerged, pulling himself out quickly. 

Dr. Fielding. 

As he stepped into the moonlight, I caught the strange expression on 
his face. His tiny black eyes were wide and seemed to be rolling around 
crazily in his head. His eyebrows twitched. His mouth was twisted open. He 
seemed to be breathing hard. 

Dr. Fielding brushed himself off with his hands and began walking 
away from the pyramid. He was half-walking, half-staggering, taking long, 
quick strides with his lanky legs. 

“But—where’s Daddy?” Sari whispered. 

Leaning out from the rocks, I could see the pyramid opening clearly. 
No light flickered. No sign of Uncle Ben. 

“He—he isn’t coming out!” Sari stammered. 

And before I could react, Sari leaped out from our hiding place behind 
the stones—and stepped into Dr. Fielding’s path. 

“Dr. Fielding,” she cried loudly, “where is my dad?” 

I pushed myself away from the stones and hurried after Sari. I could 
see Dr. Fielding’s eyes spinning wildly. He didn’t answer her question. 

“Where is my dad?” Sari repeated shrilly. 

Dr. Fielding acted as if he didn’t see Sari. He stepped past her, walking 
stiffly, awkwardly, his arms straight down. 

“Dr. Fielding—?” Sari called after him. 



He hurried through the darkness toward the row of tents. 

Sari turned back to me, her features tight with fear. “He’s done 
something to Daddy!” she cried. “I know he has!” 



19 


I turned back to the pyramid opening. Still dark and silent. 

The only sound now was the howling of the wind around the stone 
pyramid wall. 

“Dr. Fielding totally ignored me!” Sari cried, her face revealing her 
anger. “He stormed past me as if I weren’t here!” 

“I—I know,” I stammered weakly. 

“And did you see the look on his face?” she demanded. “So evil. So 
totally evil!” 

“Sari—” I started. “Maybe—” 

“Gabe, we have to go find Daddy!” Sari interrupted. She grabbed my 
arm and started pulling me to the pyramid opening. “Hurry!” 

“No, Sari, wait!” I insisted, tugging out of her grasp. “We can’t go 
stumbling around the pyramid in the dark. We’ll just get lost. We’ll never 
find Uncle Ben!” 

“We’ll go back to the tent and get lights,” she replied. “Quick, Gabe 

55 

I raised a hand to stop her. “Wait here, Sari,” I instructed. “Watch for 
your dad. Chances are, he’ll be climbing out in a few moments. I’ll run and 
get some flashlights.” 

Staring at the dark opening, she started to argue. But then she changed 
her mind and agreed to my plan. 

My heart pounding, I ran all the way back to the tent. I stopped at the 
tent opening, and gazed down the row of tents, searching for Dr. Fielding. 

No sign of him. 

In the tent, I grabbed up two flashlights. Then I went hurtling back to 
the pyramid. Please, I begged silently as I ran. Please be out of the 
pyramid, Uncle Ben. Please be safe. 

But as I frantically made my way over the sand, I could see Sari 
standing by herself. Even from a distance, I could see her frightened 
expression as she paced tensely back and forth in front of the pyramid 
opening. 

Uncle Ben, where are you? I wondered. Why haven’t you come out of 



the pyramid? Are you okay? 

Sari and I didn’t say a word. There was no need. 

We clicked on the flashlights, then made our way into the pyramid 
opening. It seemed much steeper than I remembered. I nearly lost my 
balance, lowering myself to the tunnel floor. 

Our lights crisscrossed over the dirt floor. I raised mine to the low 
ceiling. Keeping the light high, I led the way through the curving tunnel. 

Creeping along slowly, I trailed one hand against the wall to steady 
myself. The wall felt soft and crumbly. Sari kept on my heels, her bright 
beam of light playing over the floor in front of our feet. 

She stopped suddenly as the tunnel curved into a small, empty 
chamber. “How do we know we’re going in the right direction?” she asked, 
her voice a quivering whisper. 

I shrugged, breathing hard. “I thought you knew your way,” I 
murmured. 

“I’ve only been down here with Daddy,” she replied, her eyes over my 
shoulders, searching the empty chamber. 

“We’ll keep going until we find him,” I told her, forcing myself to 
sound braver than I felt. 

She stepped in front of me, shining the light over the chamber walls. 
“Daddy!” she shouted. “Daddy? Can you hear me?” 

Her voice echoed down the tunnel. Even the echo sounded frightened. 

We froze in place and listened for a reply. 

Silence. 

“Come on,” I urged. I had to lower my head to step into the next 
narrow tunnel. 

Where did it lead? Were we heading toward Prince Khor-Ru’s tomb? 
Is that where we would find Uncle Ben? 

Questions, questions. I tried to stop them from coming. But they filled 
my mind, pestering me, repeating, echoing in my head, as we followed the 
tunnel’s curves. 

“Daddy? Daddy—where are you?” Sari’s cries became more frantic as 
we moved deeper and deeper into the pyramid. 

The tunnel curved up steeply, then leveled off. Sari suddenly stopped. 
Startled, I bumped into her hard, nearly making her drop her flashlight. 
“Sorry,” I whispered. 



“Gabe, look—!” she cried, pointing her beam of light just ahead of her 
sneakers. “Footprints!” 

I lowered my eyes to the small circle of light. I could see a set of 
bootprints in the dirt. A heel and spikey bumps. “Work boots,” I muttered. 

She circled the floor with the light. There were several different prints 
in the dirt, heading in the same direction we were. 

“Does this mean we’re going the right way?” she asked. 

“Maybe,” I replied, studying the prints. “It’s hard to tell whether these 
are new or old.” 

“Daddy?” Sari shouted eagerly. “Can you hear me?” 

No reply. 

She frowned and motioned for me to follow. Seeing the many sets of 
prints gave us new hope, and we moved faster, trailing our hands along the 
wall to steady ourselves as we made our way. 

We both cried out happily when we realized we had reached the outer 
chamber to the tomb. Our lights played over the ancient hieroglyphs that 
covered the wall and the doorway. 

“Daddy? Daddy?” Sari’s voice cut through the heavy silence. 

We darted through the empty chamber, then slipped through the 
opening that led to the tomb. The prince’s burial chamber stretched out in 
front of us, dark and silent. 

“Daddy? Daddy?” Sari tried again. 

I shouted, too. “Uncle Ben? Are you here?” 

Silence. 

I swept my light over the room’s clutter of treasures, over the heavy 
chests, the chairs, the clay jars piled in the corner. 

“He isn’t here,” Sari choked out with a disappointed sob. 

“Then where did Dr. Fielding bring Uncle Ben?” I asked, thinking out 
loud. “There’s nowhere else in the pyramid that they might come.” 

Sari’s light came to rest on the large stone mummy case. Her eyes 
narrowed as she studied it. 

“Uncle Ben!” I shouted frantically. “Are you in here somewhere?” 

Sari grabbed my arm. “Gabe—look!” she cried. Her light remained on 
the mummy case. 

I couldn’t figure out what she was trying to show me. “What about it?” 
I demanded. 



“The lid,” Sari murmured. 

I gazed at the lid. The heavy stone slab covered the case tightly. 

“The lid is closed,” Sari continued, stepping away from me and toward 
the mummy case. Her fight remained on the lid. 

“Yeah. So?” I still didn’t understand. 

“When we all left this afternoon,” Sari explained, “the lid was open. In 
fact, I remember Daddy telling the workers to leave the lid open for 
tonight.” 

“You’re right!” I cried. 

“Help me, Gabe,” Sari pleaded, setting her flashlight down at her feet. 
“We have to open the mummy case.” 

I hesitated for a second, feeling a wave of cold fear run down my body. 
Then I took a deep breath and moved to help Sari. 

She was already pushing the stone lid with both hands. I stepped up 
beside her and pushed, too. Pushed with all my might. 

The stone slab slid more easily than I’d guessed. 

Working together, Sari and I strained against the lid, pushing... 
pushing. 

We moved it about a foot. 

Then we both lowered our heads to peer into the mummy’s case—and 
gasped in horror. 



20 


“Daddy!” Sari shrieked. 

Unde Ben lay on his back, knees raised, hands at his sides, his eyes 
shut. Sari and I shoved the heavy stone lid open another foot. 

“Is he—? Is he—?” Sari stammered. 

I pressed my hand on his chest. His heart was thumping with a steady 
beat. “He’s breathing,” I told her. 

I leaned into the mummy case. “Uncle Ben? Can you hear me? Uncle 
Ben?” 

He didn’t move. 

I lifted his hand and squeezed it. It felt warm, but limp. “Uncle Ben? 
Wake up!” I shouted. 

His eyes didn’t open. I lowered the hand back to the bottom of the 
mummy case. “He’s out cold,” I murmured. 

Sari stood behind me, both hands pressed against her cheeks. She 
stared down at Uncle Ben, her eyes wide with fear. “I—I don’t believe 
this!” she cried in a tiny voice. “Dr. Fielding left Daddy here to smother! If 
we hadn’t come along...” Her voice trailed off. 

Uncle Ben let out a low groan. 

Sari and I stared down at him hopefully. But he didn’t open his eyes. 

“We have to call the police,” I told Sari. “We have to tell them about 
Dr. Fielding.” 

“But we can’t just leave Daddy here,” Sari replied. 

I started to reply—but a frightening thought burst into my mind. I felt 
a shudder of fear roll down my body. “Sari?” I started. “If Uncle Ben is 
lying in the mummy case... then where is the mummy?” 

Her mouth dropped open. She stared back at me in stunned silence. 

And then we both heard the footsteps. 

Slow, scraping footsteps. 

And saw the mummy stagger stiffly into the room. 



21 


I opened my mouth to scream—but no sound came out. 

The mummy lurched stiffly through the chamber doorway. He stared 
straight ahead with his vacant, tarry eyes. Under the ancient layers of tar, 
the skull grinned at us. 

Scrape. Scrape. 

His feet dragged over the dirt floor, trailing shreds of decaying gauze. 
Slowly, he raised his arms, making a terrifying cracking sound. 

Scrape. Scrape. 

My throat tightened in terror. My entire body began to tremble. 

I backed away from the mummy case. Sari stood frozen with her hands 
pressed against her cheeks. I grabbed her arm and pulled her back with me. 
“Sari—get back! Get back!” I whispered. 

She stared in terror at the approaching mummy. I couldn’t tell if she 
heard me or not. I tugged her back further. 

Our backs hit the chamber wall. 

The mummy scraped closer. Closer. Staring at us through its vacant, 
blackened eye sockets, he reached for us with his yellowed, tar-encrusted 
hands. 

Sari let out a shrill shriek. 

“Run!” I screamed. “Sari—run!” 

But our backs were pressed against the wall. The mummy blocked our 
path to the doorway. 

Moving stiffly, awkwardly, the ancient corpse dragged itself closer. 

“This is all my fault!” I declared in a trembling voice. “I said the 
words five times. I brought him back to life!” 

“Wh-what can we do?” Sari cried in a hushed whisper. 

I didn’t have an answer. “Uncle Ben!” I shrieked desperately. “Uncle 
Ben—help us!” 

But the mummy case remained silent. Even my frantic screams could 
not awaken my uncle. 

Sari and I edged along the chamber wall, our eyes locked on the 
approaching mummy. Its bandaged feet scraped over the floor, sending up 



dark clouds of dust as it moved heavily toward us. 

A sour smell rose over the room. The smell of a four-thousand-year- 
old corpse coming to life. 

I pressed my back against the cold stone of the chamber wall, my mind 
racing. The mummy stopped at the mummy case, turned stiffly, and 
continued lurching toward us. 

“Hey—!” I cried out as an idea burst into my mind. 

My little mummy hand. The Summoner. 

Why hadn’t I thought of it before? It had saved us last summer by 
raising a group of ancient mummies from the dead. 

Could it also summon them to stop? Could it make them die again? 

If I raised the little mummy hand up to Prince Khor-Ru, would it stop 
him long enough for Sari and me to escape? 

He was only seconds away from grabbing us. 

It was worth a try. 

I reached into my back jeans pocket for the mummy hand. 

It was gone. 



22 


“No!” I uttered a surprised cry and frantically grabbed at my other pockets. 

No mummy hand. 

“Gabe—what’s wrong?” Sari demanded. 

“The mummy hand—it’s gone!” I told her, my voice choked with 
panic. 

Scrape. Scrape. 

The foul odor grew stronger as the ancient mummy dragged nearer. 

I was desperate to find my mummy hand. But I knew there was no 
time to think about it now. “We’ve got to make a run for it,” I told Sari. 
“The mummy is slow and stiff. If we can get past him...” 

“But what about Daddy?” she cried. “We can’t just leave him here.” 

“We have to,” I told her. “We’ll get help. We’ll come back for him.” 

The mummy made a brittle cracking sound as it stepped forward. The 
sound of an ancient bone breaking. 

But it continued toward us, moving stiffly but steadily, its arms 
outstretched. 

“Sari—run— now! ” I screamed. 

I gave her a hard shove to get her going. 

The room blurred as I forced myself to move. 

The mummy made another loud, cracking sound. It leaned its body 
forward, and reached out as we dodged around it. 

I tried to duck under the mummy’s outstretched hand. But I felt the 
scrape of its ancient fingers against the back of my neck—cold fingers, hard 
as a statue. 

I knew it was a touch I would never forget. 

My neck tingled. I lowered my head from his grasp—and plunged 
forward. 

Sari let out low sobs as she ran. My heart raced as I hurried to catch up 
to her. I forced myself to run, but my legs felt so heavy, as if they were 
made of solid stone. 

We were nearly to the doorway when we saw a flickering light. 



Sari and I both cried out and skidded to a stop as a beam of light swept 
into the room. Behind the light, a figure stepped into the doorway. 

Shielding my eyes from the sudden brightness, I squinted hard, eager 
to see who it was. 

“Nila!” I cried as she raised the flashlight beam to the ceiling. “Nila— 
help us!” I choked out. 

“He’s come alive!” Sari shouted to her. “Nila—he’s come alive!” She 
pointed back toward the mummy. 

“Help us!” I screamed. 

Nila’s green eyes widened in surprise. “What can I do?” she asked. 
And then her expression changed quickly to anger. “What can I do about 
you two kids? You shouldn’t be here. You’re going to ruin everything!” 

“Huh?” I cried out in surprise. 

Nila stepped into the room. She raised her right hand. 

In the dim light, I struggled to make out what she was holding up. 

My little mummy hand! 

She raised it toward the mummy. “Come to me, my brother!” Nila 
called. 



23 


“How did you get my mummy hand? What are you doing?” I demanded. 

Nila ignored my questions. She held the flashlight in one hand. She 
gripped the little hand in the other, holding it up toward the approaching 
mummy. 

“Come here, my brother!” she called, waving the hand, summoning 
the mummy. “It is I, Princess Nila!” 

Its legs cracking, its brittle bones breaking inside the gauze wrappings, 
the mummy obediently dragged itself forward. 

“Nila—stop it! What are you doing?” Sari shrieked. 

But Nila continued to ignore us. “It is I, your sister!” she called to the 
mummy. A triumphant smile crossed her pretty face. Her green eyes 
sparkled like flashing emeralds in the darting light. 

“I have waited so long for this day,” Nila told the mummy. “I have 
waited so many centuries, my brother, hoping that someday someone would 
uncover your tomb and we could be reunited.” 

Nila’s face glowed with excitement. The little mummy hand trembled 
in her hand. “I have brought you back to life, my brother!” she called to the 
mummy. “I have waited for centuries. But it will all be worth it. You and I 
will share all this treasure. And with our powers, we shall rule Egypt 
together—as we did four thousand years ago!” 

She lowered her eyes to me. “Thank you, Gabe!” she cried. “Thank 
you for The Summoner! As soon as I saw it, I knew I had to have it. I knew 
it could bring my brother back to me! The ancient words weren’t enough. I 
needed The Summoner, too!” 

“Give it back!” I demanded, reaching out for it. “It’s mine, Nila. Give 
it back.” 

A cruel laugh escaped her throat. “You won’t be needing it, Gabe,” she 
said softly. 

She waved the hand at the mummy. “Destroy them, my brother!” she 
ordered. “Destroy them now! There can be no witnesses!” 

“Nooo!” Sari shrieked. She and I both dove to the doorway. But Nila 
moved quickly to block our path. 



I shoved my shoulder against her, trying to push her away like a 
football lineman. But Nila held her ground with surprising strength. 

“Nila—let us go!” Sari demanded, breathing hard. 

Nila smiled and shook her head. “No witnesses,” she murmured. 

“Nila—we just want to get Daddy out of here. You can do what you 
want!” Sari insisted desperately. 

Nila ignored her and raised her eyes to the mummy. “Destroy them 
both!” she called. “They cannot leave this tomb alive!” 

Sari and I spun around to see the mummy lumbering toward us. Its 
blackened skull glowed in the dim light. It trailed long strips of yellowed 
gauze across the dirt floor as it dragged itself closer. 

Closer. 

I turned back to the door. Nila blocked the way. My eyes darted 
frantically around the chamber. 

No way to escape. 

No escape. 

The mummy lurched toward Sari and me. 

And reached out its cold, cold hands to obey Nila’s cruel command. 



24 


Sari and I darted toward the door. But Nila blocked our escape. 

Its vacant eyes gazing blindly at us, its jaw frozen in a hideous skeletal 
grin, the mummy hurtled toward us. 

Raised its arms stiffly. 

Stretched out its hands. 

Dove at us with a final, desperate lurch. 

And to my shock, reached past Sari and me—and wrapped its tarred 
hands around Nila’s throat. 

Her mouth opened in a choked cry of protest. 

The mummy tilted back its head as it gripped her. Its tarred lips 
moved, and a dry cough cut through the air. And then the whispered words, 
dry as death, escaped the mummy’s throat: 

“Let me ... rest in peace! ” 

Nila uttered a choked cry. 

The mummy tightened its fierce grip on her throat. 

I spun around and grabbed its arm. “Let her go!” I screamed. 

A dry wheeze erupted from the blackened skull. Its hands tightened 
around Nila, bending her back, bending her toward the floor. 

Nila’s eyes shut in defeat. Her hands flew up helplessly. The flashlight 
and the mummy hand fell to the floor. 

I grabbed my little mummy hand and shoved it into my jeans pocket. 
“Let go! Let go! Let go!” I shrieked. I leaped on to the mummy’s back and 
tried to pull its hands from Nila’s throat. 

It let out a defiant roar, a harsh whisper of anger. 

Then it heaved itself up straight and struggled to toss me off its 
shoulders. 

I gasped, startled by the mummy’s surprising strength. 

As I started to slide off the mummy’s bandaged back, I reached out my 
hand, grabbing desperately, grabbing air, trying not to fall. 

My hand grabbed onto Nila’s amber pendant. 

“Hey—!” I cried out as the mummy gave a hard toss. 



I tumbled off. 

The pendant tore off its chain. It fell from my hand, crashed to the 
floor—and shattered. 

“Noooooooooo!” Nila’s horrified wail shook the walls. 

The mummy froze. 

Nila spun out of the mummy’s grasp. Backed away. Her eyes wide 
with terror. “My life! My life]” she shrieked. 

She bent and struggled to pick up shards of amber from the floor. But 
the pendant had shattered into a hundred tiny pieces. 

“My life!” Nila wailed, staring at the smooth pieces in her palm. She 
raised her eyes to Sari and me. “I lived inside the pendant!” she cried. “At 
night, I crept inside. It kept me alive for over four thousand years! And 
now... now... ohhhhh...” 

As her voice trailed off, Nila began to shrink. 

Her head, her arms, her entire body grew tinier... tinier... until she 
disappeared into her clothes. 

And a few seconds later, as Sari and I gaped down in horror and shock, 
a black scarab crawled out from under the sweatshirt and jeans. The scarab 
moved unsteadily at first. Then it quickly scuttled away over the dirt floor, 
disappearing into the darkness. 

“That—that beetle—” Sari stammered. “Is it Nila?” 

I nodded. “I guess,” I said, staring down at Nila’s crumpled clothes. 

“Do you think she was really an ancient Egyptian princess? Prince 
Khor-Ru’s sister?” Sari murmured. 

“It’s all so weird,” I replied. I was thinking hard, trying to piece it all 
together, trying to make sense of what Nila had said. 

“She must have returned to her scarab form every night,” I told Sari, 
thinking out loud. “She crawled into the amber and slept inside it. It kept 
her alive—until...” 

“Until you smashed the amber pendant,” Sari whispered. 

“Yes.” I nodded. “It was an accident—” I started. 

But I choked on my words as I felt a cold hand close on my shoulder. 

And knew that the mummy had grabbed me from behind. 



25 


The hand rested on my shoulder. The cold seeped through my T-shirt. “Let 
go!” I screamed. 

I spun around—and my heart skipped a beat. “Uncle Ben!” I cried. 

“Daddy!” Sari leaped forward and threw her arms around him. “Daddy 
—you’re okay!” 

He pulled his hand off my shoulder and rubbed the back of his head. 
He blinked his eyes uncertainly and shook his head, still a little dazed. 

Behind him, I saw the mummy standing hunched over, frozen. Lifeless 
once again. 

“Whew. I’m still groggy,” Uncle Ben said, sweeping a hand back 
through his thick, black hair. “What a close call.” 

“It’s all my fault,” I admitted. “I repeated the words five times, Uncle 
Ben. I didn’t mean to bring the mummy back to life, but—” 

A smile crossed my uncle’s face. He lowered his arm around my 
shoulders. “You didn’t do it, Gabe,” he said softly. “Nila got there first.” 

He sighed. “I didn’t believe in the power of the chant,” he said softly. 
“But I do now. Nila stole your mummy hand and chanted the ancient words. 
She used The Summoner to bring the mummy to life. Dr. Fielding and I 
were both suspicious of her.” 

“You were?” I cried, surprised. “But I thought—” 

“I became suspicious of Nila at dinner,” Uncle Ben explained. 
“Remember? She asked me what were the six ancient words to bring the 
dead to life? Well, I had never revealed that there were six. So I wondered 
how Nila knew there were six words.” 

Uncle Ben put an arm around Sari’s shoulders, too, and led us to the 
wall. Then he leaned his back against the wall, rubbing the back of his 
head. 

“That’s why I hurried to the communications tent right after dinner,” 
Uncle Ben continued. “I phoned the Cairo Sun. They had never heard of 
Nila at the newspaper. So I knew she was a fake.” 

“But we saw Dr. Fielding pull you from the tent,” Sari broke in. “We 
saw him force you into the pyramid, and—” 



Unde Ben chuckled. “You two aren’t very good spies,” he scolded. 
“Dr. Fielding didn’t force me to do anything. He had spotted Nila sneaking 
into the pyramid. So he found me at the communications tent. And the two 
of us hurried to the pyramid to see what Nila was up to. 

“We got there too late,” Uncle Ben continued. “She had already 
brought the mummy to life. Dr. Fielding and I tried to stop her. She hit me 
over the head with her flashlight. She dragged me to the mummy case. I 
guess she stuffed me inside.” 

He rubbed his head. “That’s all I remember. Until now. Until I awoke 
and saw Nila turn into a scarab.” 

“We saw Dr. Fielding hurry out of the pyramid,” Sari reported. “He 
walked right past me. He had the weirdest look on his face, and—” 

She stopped and her mouth dropped open. We all heard the sounds at 
the same time. 

The scraping of feet on the floor outside the burial chamber. 

My heart jumped to my throat. I grabbed Uncle Ben’s arm. 

The footsteps dragged closer. 

More mummies. 

More mummies brought to life, staggering toward the prince’s tomb. 



26 


I reached into my jeans pocket for my little mummy hand. Pressing my 
back against the wall, I raised my eyes to the chamber doorway—and 
waited. 

Waited for the mummies to appear. 

But to my surprise, Dr. Fielding burst into the room, followed by four 
dark-uniformed police officers, hands at their gun holsters. 

“Ben—are you okay?” Dr. Fielding called to my uncle. “Where is the 
young woman?” 

“She... escaped,” Uncle Ben told him. 

How could he explain that she had turned into a bug? 

The police explored the chamber warily. Their eyes came to rest on the 
mummy, frozen in place near the doorway. 

“I’m so glad you’re okay, Ben,” Dr. Fielding said, placing a hand 
warmly on Uncle Ben’s shoulder. Then he turned to Sari. “I’m afraid I owe 
you an apology, Sari,” he said, frowning. “When I ran out of here, I must 
have been in shock. I remember seeing you outside the pyramid. But I don’t 
remember saying anything to you.” 

“That’s okay,” Sari replied quietly. 

“I’m really sorry if I frightened you,” Dr. Fielding told her. “Your dad 
had been knocked unconscious by that crazy young woman. And all I could 
think about was calling the police as fast as possible.” 

“Well, the excitement is over,” Uncle Ben said, smiling. “Let’s all get 
out of here.” 

We started toward the doorway, but a police officer interrupted. “Could 
I just ask one question?” he asked, staring at the upright mummy in the 
center of the floor. “Did that mummy walk?” 

“Of course not!” Uncle Ben replied quickly, a grin spreading over his 
face. “If it could walk, what would it be doing in this dump?” 

Well, once again, I turned out to be the hero of the day. And, of course, later 
in the tent, I wasted no time in bragging about my courage to Sari. 
'Sari had no choice. She had to sit there and take it. After all, / was the 
one who had stopped the mummy and turned Nila back into a beetle by 
smashing her pendant. 

“At least you’re not too conceited!” Sari shot back, rolling her eyes. 

Lame. Really lame. 

“Well, that scarab crawled away and disappeared,” she said. An evil 
smile crossed Sari’s lips. “I’ll bet that bug is waiting for you, Gabe. I’ll bet 
it’s waiting for you in your cot, waiting to bite you.” 

I laughed. “Sari, you’d say anything to try to scare me. You just can’t 
stand the idea that I’m the hero!” 

“You’re right,” she replied dryly. “I can’t stand the idea. Good night, 
Gabe.” 

A few minutes later, I was in my pajamas and ready for bed. What a 
night! What an amazing night! 

As I slid into the cot and pulled up the covers, I knew it was a night I 
would never forget. 

“Ouch!” 




PHANTOM OF THE 
AUDITORIUM 
Goosebumps - 24 
R.L. Stine 


1 


A mysterious phantom haunted our school. 

No one ever saw him. No one knew where he lived. 

But he haunted our school for more than seventy years. 

My best friend, Zeke, and I were the ones who found him. We found him 
while we were doing a school play about a phantom. 

Our teacher told us that the play was cursed, but we didn’t believe her. We 
thought it was all just a big joke. 

But when I saw the Phantom for myself, I knew it was no joke. It was all 
true. Every bit of it. 

The night we found the Phantom was the scariest night of our lives! 

But I should start at the beginning. 

My name is Brooke Rodgers, and I’m in the sixth grade at Woods Mill 
Middle School. 

Zeke Matthews is my best friend. A lot of the other girls think it’s weird 
that my best friend is a boy, but I don’t care. Zeke is cooler and funnier than any 
girls I know. He is also a big horror movie fan, like me. 

Zeke and I have been best friends for nine years. We know just about 
everything about each other. For instance, I know that Zeke still wears Kermit 
the Frog pajamas! 

He hates it when I tell people that. His face always turns a bright shade of 
red. Then his freckles stand out even more. 

Zeke hates his freckles almost as much as I hate my glasses. I don’t know 
why he’s so hung up over a couple of freckles. After a while, you hardly even 
notice them. And in the summer when he gets tan, they practically disappear 
altogether. 

I wish my glasses could disappear. They make me look so nerdy. But if I 
don’t wear them, I walk into walls! 

Some girls at school think Zeke is cute. I never think about him that way. I 
guess it’s because I’ve known him for nearly my entire life. Ever since our 
moms met in their bowling league and discovered they lived on the same street. 

The excitement about the Phantom started a couple of Fridays ago. School 
had ended for the day, and I was trying to get my locker open. I pushed my hair 



off my face and turned the combination dial. The stupid lock always jams, and it 
drives me crazy. 

After trying the combination four times, I finally got it open. I threw my 
books inside and slammed the door shut. No way was I dragging home any 
textbooks over the weekend. As of right this second, I was on vacation! Two 
whole days of no school. 

Excellent. 

Before I could turn around, a fist came whizzing by my ear and punched 
my locker with a loud bang! 

“What’s up, Brookie?” a voice called from behind me. “No homework this 
weekend?” 

I didn’t have to turn around to know who it was. Only one person in the 
whole world can ever get away with calling me Brookie. 

I turned around to see Zeke’s dopey grin. His blond hair, which was really 
long in the front and very short—almost shaved—in the back, fell over one eye. 

I smiled, then stuck my tongue out at him. 

“Real mature, Brookie,” he muttered. 

Then I flipped my eyelids up so they stayed that way. It’s a really gross 
talent I have that usually makes people scream and gag. 

Zeke didn’t bat an eye. He has seen my eyelid trick at least a zillion times. 

“Nope, no homework!” I replied. “No books. No nothing. I’m totally free 
this weekend.” 

Then I got a great idea. “Hey, Zeke,” I said, “do you think Rich can take us 
to see the Creature festival tomorrow?” 

I was dying to see the three Creature movies playing at the Cineplex. One 
was supposed to be in 3-D! Zeke and I go to scary movies all the time just to 
laugh at the scary parts. We have nerves of steel. We never get scared. 

“Maybe,” Zeke answered, brushing his hair away from his face. “But Rich 
is grounded. He can’t use the car for a week.” 

Rich is Zeke’s older brother. He spends most of his life being grounded. 

Zeke shifted his backpack onto his other shoulder. “Forget about the 
Creature festival, Brooke. Aren’t you forgetting something?” He narrowed his 
eyes at me. “Something big?” 

I scrunched up my nose. Forgetting something? I couldn’t think of a thing. 
“What?” I asked finally. 

“Come on, Brookie! Think!” 



I really had no idea what Zeke was talking about. I pulled my long hair into 
a ponytail and tied it together with the hair scrunchie that was on my wrist. 

I always wear a hair scrunchie on each wrist. I like to be prepared. You 
never know when you’re going to need a hair scrunchie. 

“Really, Zeke, I don’t know,” I said, making a tight ponytail. “Why don’t 
you just tell me?” 

And that’s when it hit me. “The cast list!” I yelled, slapping my forehead. 
How could I have forgotten? Zeke and I had been waiting two long weeks to find 
out if we got parts in the school play. 

“Come on! Let’s check it out!” I grabbed hold of Zeke’s flannel shirtsleeve. 
And I pulled him all the way to the auditorium. 

Zeke and I had both tried out for the play. Last year, we had small parts in 
the musical Guys and Dolls. Ms. Walker, our teacher, told us that the play this 
year was going to be scary. 

That’s all Zeke and I had to hear. We had to be in this play! 

We found a big crowd of kids at the bulletin board. They were all trying to 
read the cast list at once. 

I was so nervous! “I can’t look, Zeke!” I cried. “You check, okay?” 

“Yeah, no prob—” 

“Wait! I’ll do it!” I yelled, changing my mind. I do that a lot. Zeke says it 
drives him crazy. 

I took a deep breath and pushed through the crowd of kids. Biting my left 
thumbnail, I crossed the fingers on my right hand and stared up at the list. 

But when I saw what was posted up there, I nearly bit off my whole thumb! 

Tacked on the board beside the cast list was a sign: 

Attention Brooke Rodgers: Please report to Mr. Levy’s office. You have 
been suspended from school. 



2 


Suspended? 

I gasped in shock. 

Had Mr. Levy found out that I was the one who let the gerbil loose in the 
teachers’ lounge? 

Suspended. 

I felt sick to my stomach. My parents were going to be so horrified. 

Then I heard giggling. 

I spun around to find Zeke laughing his head off. Other kids were laughing, 

too. 

I stared angrily at Zeke. “Did you put that sign up?” 

“Of course! ” he replied, laughing even harder. 

He has a sick sense of humor. 

“I didn’t believe it for a second,” I lied. 

I turned back to the board to read the cast list. I had to read the list three 
times. I couldn’t believe what I saw. “Zeke!” I shouted over the other kids’ 
heads. “You and I—we’re the stars!” 

Zeke’s mouth dropped open in surprise. Then he grinned at me. “Yeah. For 
sure,” he muttered, rolling his eyes. 

“No. Really!” I cried. “We got the two biggest parts! Come check it out for 
yourself! You got the part of the Phantom!” 

“No way!” Zeke still didn’t believe me. 

“She’s telling the truth, Zeke,” a girl behind me said. Tina Powell, a 
seventh-grader, pushed through the crowd. 

I always get the feeling that Tina Powell doesn’t like me very much. I have 
no idea why. I hardly even know her. But she always seems to be frowning at 
me. Like I have a piece of spinach caught on my tooth or something. 

“Let me see that list!” Zeke demanded, pushing past everyone. “Wow! I did 
get the starring part!” 

“I’m going to be Esmerelda,” I read. “I wonder who Esmerelda is. Hey, 
maybe she’s the Phantom’s crazy old stepmother, or maybe she’s the headless 
wife who comes back from the dead to—” 

“Give it a rest, Brooke,” Tina said, frowning at me. “Esmerelda is just the 



daughter of some guy who owns a theater.” She said it as if Esmerelda were a 
nothing part. 

“Uh, what part did you get, Tina?” I asked. 

Tina shifted uncomfortably. A few other kids turned to hear her reply. 

“I’m your understudy!” she muttered, staring down at the floor. “So if you 
get sick or something and you can’t be in the show, I’ll play the part of 
Esmerelda. 

“I’m also in charge of all the scenery!” she boasted. 

I wanted to say something mean and nasty, something to put Miss High- 
and-Mighty Tina Powell in her place in front of everybody. But I couldn’t think 
of anything. 

I’m not a mean, nasty person. And it’s hard to think of mean, nasty things to 
say—even when I want to. 

So I decided to ignore her. I was too excited about the play to let Tina 
Powell get to me. 

I pulled on my denim jacket and swung my backpack over my shoulder. 
“Come on, Phantom,” I said to Zeke. “Let’s go haunt the neighborhood!” 

On Monday afternoon, we started rehearsing the play. Ms. Walker, my teacher, 
was in charge. 

She stood on the stage in the auditorium, staring down at us. She clutched a 
tall stack of scripts in her arms. 

Ms. Walker has curly red hair and pretty green eyes. She is very skinny, as 
skinny as a pencil. She is a very good teacher—a little too strict. But a good 
teacher. 

Zeke and I chose two seats next to each other in the third row. I glanced 
around at the other kids. Everyone was talking. Everyone seemed really excited. 

“Do you know what this play is about?” Corey Sklar asked me. He was 
playing my father. I mean, Esmerelda’s father. Corey has chestnut-brown hair 
like me. And he also wears glasses. Maybe that’s why we were playing relatives. 

“Beats me,” I answered him with a shrug. “Nobody knows what the play is 
about. I just know it’s supposed to be scary.” 

“I know what it’s about!” Tina Powell announced loudly. 

I turned around in my seat. “How do you know?” I demanded. “Ms. Walker 
hasn’t passed out the scripts yet.” 

“My great-grandfather went to Woods Mill Middle School a long, long time 



ago. He told me all about The Phantom, ” Tina bragged. 

I started to tell Tina that nobody cared about her great-grandfather’s dumb 
story. But then she added, “He also told me about the curse on the play!” 

That shut everyone up. Even me. 

Even Ms. Walker was listening now. 

Zeke nudged me, his eyes wide with excitement. “A curse?” he whispered 
happily. “Cool!” 

I nodded. “Very cool,” I muttered. 

“My great-grandfather told me a really scary story about this play,” Tina 
continued. “And he told me about a phantom in the school. A real phantom who

“Tina!” Ms. Walker interrupted, stepping to the front of the stage. She 
peered down sharply at Tina. “I really don’t think you should tell that story 
today.” 

“Huh? Why not?” I cried. 

“Yeah. Why not?” Zeke joined in. 

“I don’t think this is a good time to listen to scary stories that may not be 
true,” Ms. Walker replied sternly. “Today I’m going to pass out the scripts, and 

55 

“Do you know the story?” Tina demanded. 

“Yes, I’ve heard it,” Ms. Walker told her. “But I wish you would keep it to 
yourself, Tina. It’s a very scary story. Very upsetting. And I really don’t think—” 

“Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!” Zeke started to chant. 

And, instantly, we were all grinning up at our teacher and chanting loudly: 
“Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!” 

Why didn’t Ms. Walker want us to hear the story? I wondered. 

How scary could it be?

“Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!” we all continued to chant. 

Ms. Walker raised both hands for us to be silent. 

But that only made us stamp our feet in time to our chanting. 

“Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!” 

“Okay!” she shouted finally. “Okay, I’ll tell you the story. But, remember— 
it’s just a story. I don’t want you to get too scared.” 

“You can’t scare us/” Zeke cried. 

Everyone laughed. But I was staring hard at Ms. Walker. I could see that 
she really didn’t want us to know this story. 

Ms. Walker always said we could talk about anything we wanted to with 
her. I began to wonder why she didn’t want to talk about the Phantom. 

“The story starts seventy-two years ago,” Ms. Walker began, “the year 
Woods Mill Middle School was first built. I guess Tina’s great-grandfather was a 
student here that year.” 

“Yes, he was,” Tina called out. “He was in the first class that went to this 
school. He told me there were only twenty-five kids in the whole school.” 

Ms. Walker crossed her skinny arms over the front of her yellow sweater 
and continued her story. “The students wanted to put on a play. A boy was 
hunting around in the basement of the Old Woods Mill Library. He found a script 
down there. It was called The Phantom. 

“It was a very scary play about a girl who is kidnapped by a mysterious 
phantom. The boy showed it to his teacher. The teacher decided it would be fun 
to perform the play. It would be a grand production with the best scary special 
effects they could create.” 

Zeke and I exchanged excited glances. The play had special effects! We 
loved special effects! 

“Rehearsals for The Phantom began,” Ms. Walker continued. “The boy who 
had discovered the play at the library won the lead role of The Phantom. ” 

Everybody turned to look at Zeke. He smiled proudly, as if he had 
something to do with it. 

“They practiced the play after school every day,” Ms. Walker continued. 
“Everyone was having a really good time. Everyone was working really hard to 



make it a good play. It was all going smoothly, until—until—” 

She hesitated. 

“Tell us!” I called out loudly. 

“Tell us! Tell us!” a few kids started chanting again. 

“I want you all to remember this is just a story,” Ms. Walker said again. 
“There’s no proof that it ever happened.” 

We all nodded. 

Ms. Walker cleared her throat, then continued. “On the night of the play, the 
kids were all in costume. Parents and friends filled the auditorium. This 
auditorium. The kids were really excited and nervous. 

“Their teacher called them together to give them a pep talk. The play was 
about to start. But to everyone’s surprise, the boy playing the Phantom was 
nowhere to be found.” 

Ms. Walker began pacing back and forth on the stage as she continued the 
story. “They called to him. They looked for him backstage. But they couldn’t 
find the Phantom, the star of the show. 

“They spread out. They searched everywhere. But they couldn’t find him. 
The boy had vanished. 

“They searched for an hour,” Ms. Walker continued. “Everyone was so 
upset, so frightened. Especially the boy’s parents. 

“Finally, the teacher stepped out onstage to announce that the play could not 
go on. But before she could speak, a horrible scream rang out over the 
auditorium.” 

Ms. Walker stopped pacing. “It was a frightening scream. People said it was 
like an animal howl. 

“The teacher ran toward the sound. She called to the boy. But now there 
was only silence. A heavy silence. No more screams. 

“Once again, the entire school was searched. But the boy was never found.” 

Ms. Walker swallowed hard. 

We were all silent. No one even breathed! 

“He was never seen again,” she repeated. “I guess you could say that the 
Phantom became a real phantom. He just disappeared. And the play was never 
performed.” 

She stopped pacing and stared out at us. Her eyes moved from seat to seat. 

“Weird,” someone behind me murmured. 

“Do you think it’s true?” I heard a boy whisper. 



And then, beside me, Corey Sklar let out a gasp. “Oh, no!” he cried, 
pointing to the side door. “There he is! There’s the Phantom!” 

I turned—along with everyone else—and saw the hideous face of the 
Phantom, grinning at us from the doorway.

Corey Sklar screamed. 

A lot of kids screamed. I think even Tina screamed. 

The Phantom’s face was twisted in an ugly grin. His bright red hair stood 
straight up on his head. One eyeball bulged out from its socket. Black stitches 
covered a deep scar that ran all the way down the side of his face. 

“BOO!” the Phantom yelled, bursting into the aisle. 

More screams. 

I just laughed. I knew it was Zeke. 

I had seen him wear that dumb mask before. He kept it in his locker in case 
he needed it. 

“Zeke, give us a break!” I called. 

He pulled the mask off by the hair. His face was red underneath it. Zeke 
grinned at everyone. He knew he had just pulled off a really good joke. 

Kids were laughing now. 

Someone threw an empty milk container at Zeke. Another kid tried to trip 
Zeke as he headed back to his seat. 

“Very funny, Zeke,” Ms. Walker said, rolling her eyes. “I hope we won’t 
have any more visits from the Phantom!” 

Zeke dropped back into the seat next to me. “Why did you scare everyone 
like that?” I whispered. 

“Felt like it.” Zeke grinned back at me. 

“So, will we be the first kids to perform this play?” Corey asked Ms. 
Walker. 

Our teacher nodded. “Yes, we will. After the boy disappeared seventy-two 
years ago, the school decided to destroy all the scripts and the scenery. But one 
copy of the script was kept, locked up in the school vault for all these years. And 
now we’re going to perform The Phantom for the first time!” 

Kids started talking excitedly. It took Ms. Walker a while to quiet us down. 

“Now listen,” she said, putting her hands on her pencil-thin waist. “This 
was just a story. An old school legend. I’ll bet even Tina’s great-grandfather will 
tell you that it isn’t true. I only told it to put you all in a horror mood.” 

“But what about the curse?” I shouted up to her. “Tina said there was a 



curse!” 

“Yes,” Tina called out. “My great-grandfather said the play is cursed. The 
Phantom won’t let anyone perform it. Grandpa says the Phantom is still here in 
the school. The Phantom has been haunting the school for over seventy years! 
But no one has ever seen him.” 

“Excellent!” Zeke declared, his eyes lighting up. 

Some kids laughed. Some kids looked kind of uncomfortable. Kind of 
scared. 

“I told you, it’s just a story,” Ms. Walker said. “Now, let’s get down to 
business, okay? Who wants to help me pass the scripts out? I’ve made a copy for 
each of you. I want you to take them home and begin studying your parts.” 

Zeke and I practically fell over each other running up to the stage to help 
Ms. Walker. She handed us each a stack of scripts. We climbed back down and 
started to hand them out. When I came to Corey, he pulled his hand back. “Wh- 
what if the curse is true?” he called up to Ms. Walker. 

“Corey, please,” she insisted. “Enough talk about the Phantom and the 
curse, okay? We have a lot of work to do, and—” 

She didn’t finish. 

Instead, she screamed. 

I turned back to the stage, where Ms. Walker had been standing a second 
before. 

She was gone. 

She had vanished into thin air.

The scripts fell from my hands. 

I turned and made a dash for the stage. I heard kids shouting and crying out 
in surprise. 

“She just disappeared!” I heard Corey utter. 

“But that’s impossible! ” a girl shrieked. 

Zeke and I scrambled onstage together. “Ms. Walker—where are you?” I 
called. “Ms. Walker?” 

Silence. 

“Ms. Walker? Can you hear me?” Zeke called. 

Then I heard Ms. Walker’s faint cry for help. “I’m down here!” she called. 

“Down where?” Zeke cried. 

“Down here!” 

Down below the stage? That’s where her voice seemed to be coming from. 

“Help me up!” Ms. Walker called again. 

What’s going on here? I wondered. How come we can hear her, but we 
can’t see her? 

I was the first to spot the big, square hole in the stage. Zeke and the other 
kids gathered around it. I stepped to the edge of the opening and peered down. 

Ms. Walker stared up at me. She was standing on a small, square platform, 
five or six feet below the stage. “You’ll have to raise the platform,” she said. 

“How do we bring it up?” Zeke asked. 

“Press that peg. Over there on the stage,” Ms. Walker instructed. She 
pointed to a small wooden peg to the right of the trapdoor. 

“Got it!” Zeke cried. He pushed down the peg. We heard a clanking sound. 
Then a grinding sound. Then a groaning sound. 

Slowly, the platform came rising up. Ms. Walker stepped off the platform. 
She grinned at us and brushed off the back of her blue slacks. “I forgot about the 
trapdoor,” she said. “I could have broken a leg or something. But I think I’m 
okay.” 

We all gathered around. Zeke dropped down on his hands and knees, staring 
down at the trapdoor. 



“I forgot to mention the best part about this play,” Ms. Walker told us. “This 
trapdoor was built for the first production of The Phantom. It was totally 
forgotten. It’s never been used in a school play—until now!” 

My mouth dropped open. A trapdoor! How awesome! 

Ms. Walker reached down and tugged Zeke back from the opening. 
“Careful. YouTl fall,” she said. “I lowered the platform earlier. I forgot it was 
still down.” 

Zeke climbed to his feet. I could see he was really interested in the trapdoor. 

“When The Phantom was first supposed to be performed,” Ms. Walker told 
us, “the school had this trapdoor built so that the Phantom could disappear or 
rise up from below. Back then, it was a very impressive special effect.” 

I turned my eyes to Zeke. He seemed about to explode with excitement. 
“Am I the only one who gets to use it in the play?” he asked eagerly. “Can I try it 
now? Please?” 

“Not yet, Zeke,” Ms. Walker replied firmly. “I still need to have it checked 
out for safety reasons. Until it has been checked, I don’t want anybody fooling 
with the trapdoor.” 

Zeke was already back on his hands and knees, inspecting the trapdoor. 

Ms. Walker cleared her throat loudly. “Is that clear? Zeke?” she asked. 

Zeke glanced up. He sighed. “Yes, Ms. Walker,” he muttered. 

“Good,” Ms. Walker said. “Now let’s get back to our seats. I’d like to read 
through the play once before we leave today. Just to give you an idea of the story 
and the characters.” 

We returned to our seats. Zeke’s expression caught my eye. I’d seen that 
look on his face before. His forehead was wrinkled, and his left eyebrow was up. 
I could tell he was deep in thought. 

It took more than an hour to read through the play. The Phantom was a 
really scary play! 

It was about a man named Carlo who owns a very old theater where plays 
and concerts are performed. Carlo thinks his theater is haunted. 

It turns out that there really is a phantom living in the basement. His face is 
scarred. He looks like a monster. So he wears a mask. But Carlo’s daughter, 
Esmerelda, falls in love with the Phantom. She plans to run away with him. But 
her handsome boyfriend, Eric, finds out. 

Eric is in love with Esmerelda. He tracks down the Phantom in his secret 
home in a dark passage far beneath the theater. They fight. And Eric kills the 



Phantom. 

This breaks Esmerelda’s heart. She runs away, never to be seen again. And 
the Phantom survives as a ghost. He will haunt the theater forever. 

Pretty dramatic, huh? 

I think we all enjoyed reading through the play. We could see that it was 
going to be a lot of fun to perform. 

When I read my lines as Esmerelda, I tried to picture what it would be like 
to be in costume, saying the lines onstage. Once, I glanced back and saw Tina 
mouthing my lines silently to herself. 

She stopped when she caught me watching her. 

She frowned at me the way she always does. 

Tina is totally jealous, I told myself. She really wants to be Esmerelda. 

For a moment, I felt bad for Tina. I didn’t like Tina very much. But I didn’t 
want her to hate me because I had the part she wanted to play. 

But I didn’t have much time to think about Tina. I had a lot of lines to read. 
Esmerelda was onstage a lot in this play. It was a really big part. 

When we finally finished reading the play, we all clapped and cheered. 

“Okay. Go home, everyone,” Ms. Walker instructed, waving us to the door. 
“Start learning your parts. We’ll meet again tomorrow.” 

As I began to follow the other kids to the door, I felt a hand pull me back. I 
turned to find Zeke pulling me behind a wide concrete beam. 

“Zeke—what are you doing?” I demanded. 

He raised a finger to his lips. “Shhhh.” His eyes were really excited. “Let 
them all go,” he whispered. 

I peeked out from behind the pillar. Ms. Walker lowered the lights. Then 
she collected her papers and made her way out through the auditorium door. 

“Why are we hiding here?” I whispered impatiently. 

Zeke grinned at me. “Let’s try out the trapdoor,” he whispered back. 

“Huh?” 

“Let’s try it out. Quick. While there’s no one in here.” 

I glanced quickly around the auditorium. Dark. And empty. 

“Come on. Don’t be a wimp,” Zeke urged, pulling me toward the stage. 
“Let’s try it out, okay? What could happen?” 

I turned uncertainly to the stage. “Okay,” I said. 

Zeke was right. What could happen?

Zeke and I climbed on to the stage. It was darker than before. And it felt colder. 

Our sneakers thudded over the floorboards. Every sound seemed to echo 
over the whole auditorium. 

“This trapdoor is so cool!” Zeke exclaimed. “Too bad you don’t get to use it 
in the play.” 

I gave him a playful shove and started to reply. But I suddenly felt one of 
my sneezing attacks coming on. The dusty auditorium curtain must have 
triggered my allergies. 

I have the worst allergies in creation. I am allergic to absolutely everything. 
You name it. Dust, pollen, cats, dogs—even some sweaters. 

When I have an allergy attack, sometimes I sneeze thirteen or fourteen 
times in a row. My all-time record is seventeen. 

Zeke likes to count my sneezes. He thinks he’s a riot. He slaps the floor and 
yells, “Seven! Eight! Nine!” 

Ha-ha. After ten sneezes in a row, I’m in no mood for jokes. I’m usually a 
pitiful, dripping mess with foggy glasses. 

We tiptoed over to the trapdoor. “Check the floor around there,” Zeke said 
quietly. “Find that peg that makes it work.” 

Zeke stood on the trapdoor while I searched for the peg in the darkness. I 
desperately tried to hold in my sneezes, but it wasn’t easy. 

Then the small peg on the stage floor caught my eye. “Hey—I found it!” I 
shouted happily. 

Zeke glanced nervously around the auditorium. “Ssshhh! Someone will 
hear you!” 

“Sorry,” I whispered. Then I realized I couldn’t hold out any longer. My 
eyes were watering like crazy, and I just had to sneeze. 

I grabbed a handful of tissues from my pocket and put the whole wad up to 
my nose. Then I started sneezing. I tried to keep them as silent as possible. 

“Four! Five!” Zeke counted. 

Fuckily, it wasn’t a record-breaking attack. I only made it to seven. I wiped 
my nose and shoved the dirty tissues in my pocket. It was gross, but I had 
nowhere else to throw them. 



“Okay, Zeke, here goes!” I cried. 

I stepped on the peg and jumped beside Zeke on the trapdoor. 

We heard a clanking sound. Then a rumbling. Then a grinding. 

The square section of floor began to lower itself. 

Zeke grabbed my arm. “Hey—this thing is kind of shaky!” he cried. 

“You’re not scared—are you!” I challenged him. 

“No way!” he insisted. 

The clanking grew louder. The square platform shook beneath us as we slid 
down. Down, down—until the stage disappeared, and we were surrounded by 
darkness. 

I expected the platform to come to a stop just beneath the stage. That’s 
where it stopped for Ms. Walker. 

But, to my surprise, the platform kept dropping. 

And it picked up speed as it slid farther and farther down. 

“Hey—what’s happening?” Zeke cried, holding on to my arm. 

“How far down does this thing go?” I wondered out loud. 

“Ohh!” Zeke and I both cried out as the platform finally hit the bottom with 
a hard thud! 

We were both thrown to the floor. 

I scrambled to my feet quickly. “Are you okay?” 

“Yeah. I guess.” Zeke definitely sounded scared. 

We seemed to be in a long, black tunnel. 

Dark. And silent. 

I don’t like to admit it. But I was very close to being scared, too. 

Suddenly the silence was broken by a soft, raspy noise. 

I felt panic choke my throat. That sound. What was it? 

The sound repeated softly, steadily. 

Like breathing. 

My heart pounded in my chest. Yes! Breathing. The raspy breathing of a 
strange creature. So close to me. 

Right next to me. 

Zeke! 

“Zeke—why are you breathing like that?” I demanded, feeling my heartbeat 
slow to normal. 

“Breathing like what?” he whispered. 



“Oh. Never mind,” I muttered. He was breathing that way because he was 
scared. We were both scared. But there was no way we would ever admit it to 
each other. 

We both raised our eyes to the auditorium ceiling. It was a small, square 
glow in the far distance. It seemed to be miles and miles above us. 

Zeke turned to me. “Where do you think we are?” 

“We’re about a mile beneath the stage,” I replied, feeling a chill. 

“No kidding, Sherlock,” Zeke replied nastily. 

“If you’re so smart, you tell me!” I challenged him. 

“I don’t think it’s the basement,” he said thoughtfully. “I think we’re way 
below the basement.” 

“It feels like it’s a big tunnel or something,” I said, trying to keep my voice 
from shaking. “Want to explore?” 

He didn’t answer for a long moment. “Too dark to explore,” he replied 
finally. 

I didn’t really want to explore. I was just pretending to be brave. Usually, I 
liked having the creeps. But being way down here was too creepy, even for me. 

“We’ll come back with flashlights,” Zeke said softly. 

“Yeah. Flashlights,” I repeated. I didn’t plan to ever come back! 

I played nervously with the denim hair scrunchie on my wrist and stared out 
into the darkness. Something bothered me. Something didn’t make sense. 

“Zeke,” I said thoughtfully, “why would the stage trapdoor come all the 
way down here?” 

“I don’t know. Maybe so the Phantom can get home quicker after he haunts 
the auditorium!” Zeke joked. 

I punched him in the arm. “No jokes about the Phantom—okay?” 

If there really is a phantom, I told myself, this is where he would live. 

“Let’s get out of here!” Zeke said, staring up at the square of light so far 
above our heads. “I’m going to be late for dinner.” 

“Yeah, sure,” I replied, folding my arms across my chest. “Just one 
question, Mr. Know-It-All.” 

“What question?” Zeke asked uncertainly. 

“How do we get back up?” 

We both thought about that one for a while. 

After a minute or so, I saw Zeke drop to his knees and begin running his 
hand along the platform floor. “There’s got to be a peg to push down here,” he 



said. 

“No. The peg is up there,” I replied, pointing way up to the stage floor. 

“Then there’s got to be a switch or a lever or a button to push!” Zeke cried. 
His voice grew high and shrill. 

“Where? Where could it be?” My voice sounded just as shrill, just as 
frightened. 

We both started feeling around in the darkness, feeling for something we 
could push, or pull, or turn. Something to make the little square platform rise up 
again and carry us back up to the auditorium. 

But after a few minutes of desperate searching, I gave up. 

“We’re trapped down here, Zeke,” I murmured. “We’re trapped.”

“This is all your fault,” I muttered. 

I don’t know why I said that. I guess I was so frightened, I didn’t know 
what I was saying. 

Zeke forced a laugh. “Hey, I like it down here!” he boasted. “I may just stay 
down here for a while. You know. Do some exploring.” He was trying to sound 
brave. But his voice came out tiny and trembling. 

He wasn’t fooling me. No way. 

“How could you bring us down here?” I cried. 

“You wanted to come, too!” he shot back. 

“I did not!” I screamed. “Ms. Walker told us this thing isn’t safe! And now 
we’ll be down here all night! Maybe forever!” 

“Unless we’re eaten by rats!” Zeke joked. 

“I’m sick of your stupid jokes!” I shouted. I totally lost it. I gave him a hard 
shove with both hands. He went sprawling off the platform. 

It was so dark, I couldn’t see him for a moment. 

“Ow!” I cried out as he shoved me back. 

Then I shoved him harder. 

Then he shoved me harder than that. 

I stumbled back—onto some kind of a switch. My back hit the switch. 

A loud clanking sound made me nearly jump out of my skin. 

“Brooke—jump back on! Quick!” Zeke screamed. 

I leaped back onto the platform just as it started to move. 

Up, up. Sliding slowly but steadily. 

The square of light above our heads grew larger and brighter as we rose 
back up to the auditorium. 

“Hey!” I cried out as the platform stopped with a jolt. 

“Way to go, Brookie!” Zeke yelled happily. He slapped me on the back. 

“Don’t celebrate yet,” I told him. We still weren’t back on the stage. The 
platform had stopped about five feet down from the top. Just where it had been 
for Ms. Walker. 

I guessed that the only way to raise it all the way up was to step on the peg 



onstage. 

“Give me a boost up,” Zeke urged eagerly. 

I cupped my hands together. He lowered his sneaker into my hands. 

“Wait!” he cried, stepping back down. “Whoa! What if the Phantom is up 
there waiting for us? Maybe you should go first!” 

“Ha-ha. Very funny,” I said, rolling my eyes. “Remind me to laugh later.” 
“Okay, okay. I’ll go first,” he muttered. 

He put his sneaker into my cupped hands, reached up to the stage floor, and 
I gave him a boost. 

I watched him scramble on to the stage. He disappeared from view. 

I waited for him to reach down for me. 

A whole minute went by. 

“Zeke?” The word came out tiny and weak. 

I waited some more. Listening hard. 

I couldn’t hear him up there. Where was he? 

“Zeke? Where are you?” I called up. “Come on. Raise the platform. Or give 
me a hand,” I called up. “I can’t make it by myself.” 

Another minute passed. It seemed like an hour. 

I suddenly realized what Zeke was trying to do. 

That big jerk! He was trying to scare me! 

“Hey! Enough!” I shouted. 

I had had more than enough of Zeke Matthews for one day. 

“Zeke!” I yelled. “Give me a break! Get me up!” 

Finally, his hands lowered down over the side. 

“It’s about time!” I shouted angrily. 

I grabbed both hands and let him pull me up to the stage. 

I shook my hair back. My eyes were slowly adjusting to the brighter light. 
“You know, you’re not funny!” I snapped. “Keeping me waiting down there was 
really—” 

I stopped and swallowed hard. It wasn’t Zeke who had pulled me from the 
trapdoor. 

A strange pair of dark, angry eyes stared into mine. 



8 


I swallowed hard. A strange little man stared back at me, an angry scowl on his 
face. He wore baggy gray pants and a loose-fitting gray sweatshirt, torn at the 
collar. 

His thick white hair fell wild and unbrushed over his forehead like a floor 
mop. He had a deep purple scar down the side of his face, nearly as long as the 
scar on Zeke’s creature mask. 

I could see that he was old. But he was tiny, no bigger than a kid. He stood 
only an inch or two taller than Zeke. 

As he squinted at me with his strange, gray eyes, his face twisted into an 
ugly frown. 

He looks like a phantom! The frightening thought flashed through my mind. 

“Wh-who are you?” I stammered. 

“I’m Emile. The night janitor,” the man rasped. 

“Where’s my friend Zeke?” I demanded in a shrill, frightened voice. 

“Brooke, I’m over here,” Zeke called out from behind me. 

I whirled around. Zeke stood on the other side of the trapdoor. He had his 
hands shoved deep into his jeans pockets. He was biting his lower lip. 

“Zeke!” I cried. “What’s going on? Why—” 

“The school is closed!” the janitor growled. He had a hoarse voice, like 
sandpaper. “What are you two doing in here?” 

Zeke and I exchanged glances. Zeke took a step forward. “We... uh... 
stayed for play rehearsal,” he told the man. 

“That’s right,” I chimed in. “We had a late rehearsal.” 

The janitor continued to squint suspiciously at me. “Play rehearsal?” he 
repeated. “Then where is everybody else?” 

I hesitated. This guy was scaring me so much, my legs wobbled. “We left,” 
I blurted out. “But we had to come back to get my jacket.” 

Behind Emile, I saw Zeke nodding, approving my lie. 

“How do you know about the trapdoor?” the janitor demanded in his 
sandpaper voice. 

I hesitated. It’s strange that I’ve never seen him in the school building 
before, I thought. 



“Ms. Walker, our teacher, showed it to us,” Zeke said softly. I could see that 
he was as scared as I was. 

The man leaned closer to me, squinting so that one side of his face was 
completely twisted up. “Don’t you know how dangerous it is?” he whispered. 

He leaned even closer, so close that I could feel his hot breath on my face. 
His pale gray eyes stared into mine. “Don’tyou know how dangerous it is?” 

Zeke and I talked on the phone that night. “That man wasn’t trying to warn us,” I 
told Zeke. “He was trying to scare us.” 

“Well, he didn’t scare me at all,” Zeke boasted. “I’m sorry if he got you 
upset, Brookie.” 

Oh, wow, I thought. Sometimes Zeke is such a phoney. 

“If you weren’t scared, how come you were shaking all the way home?” I 
demanded. 

“I wasn’t shaking. I was just exercising,” Zeke joked. “You know. Working 
out the calf muscles.” 

“Give me a break,” I moaned. “How come we’ve never seen that janitor 
before?” 

“Because he’s not a janitor. He is... the PHANTOM!” Zeke cried in a deep, 
scary voice. 

I didn’t laugh. “Get serious,” I told him. “It wasn’t a joke. He was really 
trying to frighten us.” 

“Hope you don’t have nightmares, Brookie,” Zeke replied, laughing. 

I hung up on him.

On Tuesday morning, I walked to school with my little brother, Jeremy. As we 
walked, I talked about the play. 

I told Jeremy the whole story. But I left out the part about the trapdoor. Ms. 
Walker said it would be better if we kept it a secret until the performance. 

“Is it really scary?” Jeremy asked me. Jeremy is seven, and he gets scared if 
you say “boo” to him. Once, I made him watch the movie Poltergeist with me, 
and he woke up screaming every night for three weeks. 

“Yeah, it’s pretty scary,” I told him. “But not scary like Friday the 13th 
scary.” 



Jeremy seemed relieved. He really hated scary things. On Halloween, he 
hid in his room! I would never make him watch Friday the 13th. He would 
probably have nightmares till he was fifty! 

“The play has a surprise,” I added. “And it’s a pretty awesome surprise.” 

“What is it?” Jeremy demanded. 

I reached over and messed up his hair. It’s chestnut-brown, like mine. “If I 
told you that,” I said, making a funny voice, “it wouldn’t be a surprise, would 
it?” ” 

“You sound just like Mom!” Jeremy cried. 

What an insult! 

I dropped him off at his school and then crossed the street to my school. As 
I made my way down the hall, I thought about my part in the play. Esmerelda 
had so many lines. I wondered if I could memorize them all in time. 

And I wondered if my old stage fright would come back. Last year, I had 
terrible stage fright in Guys and Dolls. And I didn’t even have any lines to say! 

I walked into the classroom, said good morning to some kids, made my way 
to my table—and stopped. 

“Hey!” A boy I had never seen before was at my place. 

He was kind of cute. He had dark brown hair and bright green eyes. He was 
wearing a big red-and-black flannel shirt over black sweatpants. 

He had made himself right at home. His books and notebooks were spread 
out. And he was tilting back in my chair with his black high-tops resting on the 
table. 

“You’re in my place,” I said, standing over him. 

He gazed up at me with those green eyes. “No, I’m not,” he replied 
casually. “This is my place.” 



9 


“Excuse me?” I said, staring down at him. 

He blushed. “I think this is where Ms. Walker told me to sit.” He glanced 
around nervously. 

I saw an empty spot at the table behind mine. “She probably meant over 
there,” I said, pointing. “I’ve been in this seat all year. Next to Zeke.” I motioned 
to Zeke’s chair. Zeke wasn’t there. He was late, as usual. 

The boy blushed even darker. “Sorry,” he muttered shyly. “I hate being the 
new kid.” He started to gather his books together. 

“This is your first day?” I asked. I introduced myself. 

“I’m Brian Colson,” he replied, climbing to his feet. “My family just moved 
to Woods Mill. From Indiana.” 

I said I’d never been to Indiana. It was a boring thing to say, but it was true. 

“You’re Brooke Rodgers?” he asked, studying me. “I heard you got the 
starring role. In the play.” 

“How did you hear that already?” I demanded. 

“Some kids were talking about it on the bus. You must be a good actress, 
huh?” he added shyly. 

“I guess. I don’t know. Sometimes I get pretty bad stage fright,” I told him. 

I don’t know why I told him all that. Sometimes I just rattle on. I guess 
that’s why my parents call me Babbling Brooke. 

Brian smiled shyly and sighed. “Back at my school in Indiana, I was in all 
the plays,” he told me. “But I never had the lead role. I wish I had moved here 
sooner. Then I could have tried out for The Phantom. ” 

I tried to picture Brian onstage in a play, but I couldn’t. He didn’t seem like 
the acting type to me. He seemed so shy. And he kept blushing all the time. 

But I decided to give the poor guy a break. “Brian, why don’t you come to 
rehearsal with me this afternoon?” I suggested. “Maybe you can get a small part 
or something.” 

Brian smiled as if I’d just offered him a million dollars. “You mean it?” he 
asked, wide-eyed. 

“Sure,” I replied. “No big deal.” 

Zeke came slinking into his seat, his eyes on Ms. Walker’s desk. “Am I 



late?” he whispered. 

I shook my head. Then I started to introduce him to Brian. But Ms. Walker 
stepped into the room and closed the door. Time for class to begin. 

Brian hurried to his place at the other table. I started to sit down, but 
realized I’d left my science notebook in my locker. 

“Be right back!” I called to Ms. Walker. I hurried out the door and jogged 
around the corner to my locker. 

“Hey!” To my surprise, the locker door stood half open. 

That’s weird, I thought. I remembered locking it. 

I pulled the door open the rest of the way. Started to reach inside for my 
notebook. 

And let out a startled gasp. 

Someone was in there—and he was staring right at me! 



10 


His ugly blue-and-green face grinned out at me. 

I gasped again and clamped my hand over my mouth. Then I cracked up 
laughing. 

Zeke and his dumb rubber creature mask. 

“Well, you got me this time, Zeke!” I murmured out loud. 

Then I saw the folded-up sheet of paper dangling beneath the mask. Some 
kind of note? 

I pulled it out and unfolded it. Scribbled in red crayon was a message: 

STAY AWAY FROM MY 
HOME SWEET HOME. 

“Ha-ha,” I murmured. “Very good, Zeke. Very amusing.” 

I pulled out my science notebook, slammed the locker shut, and locked it. 
Then I hurried back to the classroom. 

Ms. Walker stood behind her desk. She had just finished introducing Brian 
to everyone. Now she was reading the morning announcements. I slid into my 
seat beside Zeke. “You didn’t scare me one bit,” I lied. 

He looked up from his math notebook. Zeke always did his math homework 
first thing in class. “Huh?” He flashed me his innocent look. 

“Your mask,” I whispered. “It didn’t scare me.” 

“Mask? What mask?” he replied, tapping the pencil eraser against my arm. 

I shoved him away. “Stop acting stupid,” I said sharply. “Your note wasn’t 
funny, either. You can do better than that.” 

“I didn’t write you any note, Brooke,” Zeke replied impatiently. “I don’t 
know what you’re talking about. Really.” 

“For sure,” I said, rolling my eyes. “You don’t know anything about the 
mask in my locker or the note, right?” 

“Shut up and let me finish my math,” he said, staring down at his textbook. 
“You’re not making any sense.” 

“Oh. Well. I guess the real Phantom did it, then,” I said. 

He ignored me. He was scribbling equations in his notebook. 



What a phoney baloney! I thought. Zeke did it, and he knows it. 
For sure. 


* * * 


After school, I led Brian to the auditorium. I practically had to drag him up on 
the stage. He was so shy! 

“Ms. Walker, are there any parts still available?” I asked. “Brian is really 
interested in being in the play.” 

Ms. Walker glanced up from the script in her hands. I saw that she had 
scribbled notes all over the script. She studied Brian. 

“I’m really sorry, Brian,” she said, shaking her head. “You came to school a 
few days too late.” 

Brian blushed. I’ve never seen anyone blush so often. 

“There aren’t any speaking parts left,” Ms. Walker told him. “They’ve all 
been given out.” 

“Do you need a stand-in for anyone?” Brian asked. “I’m a very fast 
memorizer. I could memorize more than one part.” 

Wow, I thought. He really is eager to be in the play. 

“Well, we really don’t need any more stand-ins,” Ms. Walker told him. 
“But, I have an idea. You can join the scenery crew if you wish.” 

“Great!” Brian exclaimed with real enthusiasm. 

“Go see Tina over there,” Ms. Walker told him, pointing to the group of 
kids meeting at the back wall of the stage. Tina was busily pointing out where 
she wanted the scenery to go, motioning dramatically with both hands, making 
everyone follow her all around the stage. 

Brian seemed really happy. I watched him trot over to find Tina. 

I took a seat in the auditorium and concentrated on my script. I was in 
practically every scene. How could I possibly memorize my whole part? I sighed 
and slouched back in the seat, slinging my feet over the seat in front of me. 

I was memorizing my third line in the play, which went, “What proof do 
you have that this man might be dangerous ?”, when all the lights suddenly went 
out. 

A total blackout! I couldn’t see a thing. 

Kids started to shout. “Hey! Who turned out the lights?” 

“I can’t see!” 



“What’s happening? Turn them back on!” 

I sat straight up when I heard the shrill scream. 

A terrifying scream—like an animal howl—that ripped through the 
darkness and exploded over the auditorium. 

“No! Noooo!” I heard Corey Sklar moan. 

And then I heard someone else cry out, “It’s coming from up on the 
catwalk!” 

Another shrill wail rose up over the frightened cries of my friends. 

“Turn on the lights!” I heard Corey plead. “Please—turn on the lights!” 
Other frightened voices called out, “Who is screaming?” 

“Somebody—do something!” 

“There’s someone up on the catwalk!” 

The auditorium lights flickered back on. 

Another long howl from above the stage forced me to raise my eyes. 

And I saw him. A green-and-blue-masked creature wearing a shiny black 

cape. 

Gripping a long, heavy rope, he came swinging down from high on the 
catwalk. 

As he swung down to the stage, he threw his head back and laughed a 
horrifying evil laugh. 

I jumped to my feet and stared in amazement. 

The Phantom! 



11 


The Phantom landed hard on his feet. His shoes hit the stage floor with a thud. 

He let go of the rope and it flew away from him. 

The green-and-blue face glanced quickly around the stage. Tina and her 
scenery crew stood frozen against the wall, staring at him in horrified silence. 
Ms. Walker appeared stunned. She had her arms tightly crossed over her chest. 

The Phantom’s cape swirled around him as he stomped one shoe on the 
stage. 

He’s short, I realized, standing and staring from down in the second row of 
seats. He’s about Zeke’s height. Maybe an inch or two taller. 

Or maybe he’s exactly Zeke’s height—because he is Zeke! 

“Zeke! Hey—Zeke!” I called. 

The ugly, masked face peered out to the auditorium. The Phantom started to 
sink. His feet disappeared. The legs of his dark pants. Down. Down. 

He had stepped on the peg and was riding the trapdoor down. 

“Zeke!” I yelled. I ran up the aisle and pulled myself up onto the stage. 
“Zeke—you’re not funny!” I shouted. 

But the Phantom had vanished below the stage. 

I ran up to the opening in the stage and stared down into the darkness. Ms. 
Walker stepped up beside me, an angry scowl on her face. “Was that Zeke?” she 
asked me. “Was that really Zeke?” 

“I—I’m not sure,” I stammered. “I think so.” 

“Zeke!” Ms. Walker called down into the opening. “Zeke—are you down 
there?” 

No reply. 

The platform had lowered all the way down. I couldn’t see anything but a 
deep well of blackness. 

Kids gathered around the opening, chattering excitedly, laughing and 
teasing each other. “Was that Zeke?” I heard Corey ask. “Was Zeke wearing that 
dumb mask again?” 

“Is Zeke going to ruin our rehearsal today?” Ms. Walker demanded angrily. 
“Does he think we need to be scared every afternoon?” 

I shrugged. I couldn’t answer. 



“Maybe it wasn’t Zeke,” I heard Corey say. He sounded very frightened. 

“It had to be Zeke. Zeke—are you here?” Ms. Walker shouted, cupping her 
hands around her mouth. She turned slowly, her eyes darting over the stage and 
then all the seats of the auditorium. “Zeke Matthews? Can you hear me?” 

No answer. No sign of Zeke. 

“He’s your friend, Brooke,” Tina said nastily. “Don’t you know where he 
is? Can’t you tell him to stop ruining our play?” 

I sputtered an answer. I was so angry, I didn’t know what I was saying. 

I mean, Zeke is my friend. But I’m not responsible for him! 

Tina was just trying to make me look bad and score some points with Ms. 
Walker. 

“Okay, scenery people,” Ms. Walker instructed. “Back to work. I’ll take 
care of this. The rest of you—” 

She stopped. We all heard it. The loud clanking sound. 

A loud hum rose up over the clanking. 

“The trapdoor—it’s coming back up!” I cried, pointing. 

“Good,” Ms. Walker said, crossing her arms over her chest again. She 
narrowed her eyes at the opening in the stage floor. “Now I will let Zeke know 
how we feel about his little joke. His last little joke, if I have anything to say 
about it!” 

Uh-oh, I thought. Poor Zeke. 

Ms. Walker was a really good teacher, and a really nice person, too—until 
you got on her bad side. But once you did that, once you made her angry, once 
you had her crossing her arms and squinting her eyes at you—then you were in 
major trouble. 

Because she could be really mean. 

I knew that Zeke was just having some fun. He loved being the center of 
attention. And he loved to scare people. He especially loved to scare me. 

This was a game for him, I knew. He was trying to show everyone that they 
were scaredy-cat wimps, and he wasn’t. 

Zeke played this game all the time. 

But this time it had backfired. This time he had gone too far. 

And Ms. Walker was waiting for him, arms crossed, eyes squinting. 

Will she toss him out of the play? I wondered. Or will she just yell at him 
until his ears curl? 

The hum grew louder. The stage floor vibrated. 



We all heard the platform stop—its usual five feet below the stage. 

Poor Zeke, I thought. He’s standing there innocently. He doesn’t know what 
’s in for. 

Poor Zeke. 

I peered down into the opening—and gasped. 



12 


The platform was empty. No one there. 

Zeke—or whoever it was—had sent it back up empty. And had disappeared 
into the dark tunnels far below the school. 

Zeke wouldn’t do that, I told myself. Even Zeke wouldn’t be crazy enough 
to go down in that darkness by himself. Without a flashlight. Without a clue as to 
what was down there. 

Would he? 

Yes, he would. I answered my own question. If he thought he could really 
terrify us, Zeke would do anything! 

Ms. Walker canceled the rehearsal. She told the scenery crew to stay and 
paint the backdrop. She told the rest of us to go home and study our parts. 

“I’m going to have a long talk with Zeke when I find him,” she muttered. 
Then she turned and made her way quickly out of the auditorium. 

I took my time walking home. I thought about Zeke all the way. I was 
thinking so hard, I walked right past my house! 

Down the block, I saw Zeke’s mother’s red Pontiac pull up their driveway. 
Shielding my eyes against the late afternoon sun, I saw Mrs. Matthews climb out 
of the car. And then I saw Zeke on the other side. 

“Hey! Zeke!” I shouted as I went running across the lawns toward him. 
“Zeke!” 

His mother waved to me and disappeared into the house. Zeke looked 
surprised to see me. “Is play rehearsal over so early?” he asked. 

“Yes. Thanks to you,” I muttered. 

“Huh?” He gave me his innocent look again. “What did / do?” 

“You didn’t scare me, Zeke,” I told him. “No one thought it was funny. And 
now you’re in a load of trouble with Ms. Walker.” 

He narrowed his eyes and scrunched up his face, pretending not to 
understand. “What are you talking about, Brooke? How can I be in trouble? I 
wasn’t even there!” 

“You were there long enough,” I told him. 

He shook his head. His freckles seemed to grow darker. His blond hair 
fluttered in the wind. “No, I wasn’t,” he said quietly. “I told Ms. Walker I 



wouldn’t be there. I told her this morning that I had to miss rehearsal.” 

“So you could get into your mask and cape and come flying down from the 
catwalk?” I demanded suspiciously. 

“No. I told her I had a dentist appointment.” 

I gaped at him in shock. My mouth dropped open. 

“What’s your problem, Brooke?” he demanded. “It was only a checkup.” 

“You—you really weren’t at school?” I stammered. 

He shook his head. “No way.” 

“Then who was the Phantom?” I asked in a tiny voice. 

A strange smile spread over Zeke’s face. 

“It was you!” I cried angrily. “You did your Phantom act, and then you went 
to your dentist appointment! Didn’t you, Zeke! Didn’t you!” 

He only laughed. He wouldn’t answer. 

After school the next afternoon, I walked with Brian to the auditorium. He 
looked cute in a black vest over a plain white T-shirt and faded jeans. “How are 
you doing with Tina?” I asked. 

“Okay, I guess,” Brian replied. “She’s a little bossy. But she’s letting me 
design the backdrop pretty much on my own.” 

I waved to some kids who were heading out the door for home. We turned 
the corner. I saw Corey and Tina walking into the auditorium. 

“Did Zeke work things out with Ms. Walker?” 

Brian asked. “I saw him talking to her this morning.” 

“I guess,” I replied. “She’s letting Zeke stay in the play—for now.” 

“Do you think it was Zeke who pulled that stunt yesterday?” Brian asked. 

I nodded. “Yes, I do. Zeke likes scaring people. He’s been doing it since we 
were little. I think Zeke is trying to scare us. He’s trying to make us think there’s 
a real Phantom in the school.” I smiled at Brian. “But I don’t scare so easy!” I 
declared. 

Soon after rehearsal started, Ms. Walker called Zeke and me onstage. She said 
she wanted to walk us through one of our scenes together. She wanted to show 
us where we should stand when we said our lines. She called it “blocking”. 

She also asked Tina Powell and Robert Hernandez, Zeke’s understudy, to 
come up onstage. Ms. Walker said they should know all the blocking, too. Just in 


case. 



Just in case? I thought. Then I remembered Tina’s warning: “In case you 
get sick or something on the night of the play, I get to play your part. ” 

Well, Tina, I hate to disappoint you, I muttered to myself, but I plan to be 
perfectly fine. So have fun painting your scenery. It’s the only time you’ll be 
onstage. 

I know, I know. That’s kind of mean. But Tina deserved it. 

Ms. Walker showed Zeke where to stand. I stood off to the side of the stage 
with Tina, waiting for my cue to go on. 

“I guess Ms. Walker and Zeke worked things out,” Tina said. “I heard him 
this morning telling her he was at the dentist’s, and so he couldn’t be the one to 
swing down from the ceiling.” 

I started to tell Tina to be quiet so I could hear my cue. But I was too late. I 
already heard Ms. Walker calling my name. 

“Brooke Rodgers!” She sounded angry. “What’s going on over there? 
You’re supposed to be onstage!” 

“Thanks a bunch, Tina,” I muttered under my breath. I ran out onto the 
stage. Glancing back, I could see Tina laughing to herself. 

I couldn’t believe it! Tina had made me miss my cue on purpose! 

Onstage, I didn’t know where I was supposed to stand. I didn’t even know 
what page of the script we were on. 

What was my next line? 

I couldn’t remember. 

In a panic, I stared out at the kids in the auditorium seats. They all stared 
back at me, waiting for me to speak. 

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. 

“The line is, ‘Is somebody down here?’\” Tina yelled loudly from offstage. 

Oh, wow, I thought unhappily. Tina will do anything to show me up! She’s 
just hoping Ms. Walker will kick me out of the play. 

I felt so angry, my head was spinning. I couldn’t think straight. I repeated 
the line, then took a deep breath to calm down. 

Zeke had the next line. He was supposed to appear onstage and scare 
Esmerelda. 

But Zeke wasn’t onstage. He wasn’t anywhere in sight! 

I peered out into the auditorium. Ms. Walker stood at the foot of the stage. 
She had her hands on her waist. She tapped one toe impatiently on the hard floor. 

The auditorium grew silent, except for that tap. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Ms. 



Walker seemed to be very annoyed. 

“Where is Zeke?” she asked wearily. “What is he doing now? Is he going to 
come flying down from the catwalk in full costume or something?” 

I should have guessed what Zeke was up to. But it didn’t dawn on me until I 
heard a familiar noise. The loud clanking. Followed by the hum. 

The trapdoor platform! It was rising! 

I sighed. “Here comes Zeke,” I told Ms. Walker. 

And a second later, Zeke’s blue-and-green masked head appeared. 

I stepped back and watched him rise from down below. It looked awesome. 
Really dramatic. 

Slowly, he appeared, rising up over the stage floor. 

He reached the top and just stood there for a long moment, staring out at the 
auditorium, as if posing for a picture. He was in full costume: his mask, a black 
cape down to his ankles, black shirt and pants. 

What a ham! I thought. He really loves having everyone stare at him and 
think he’s hot stuff! 

And then he stepped toward me, taking quick strides. Through the mask, he 
raised his eyes to me. 

I tried to remember what I was supposed to say next. 

But before I could utter a sound, he grabbed both of my shoulders. He 
shook them really hard. Too hard. 

Ease up, Zeke, I thought. It’s only a rehearsal. 

“Go away! ” he cried in a furious whisper. 

I remembered what I was supposed to say. I opened my mouth to speak... 

But then I froze. 

I saw someone waving to me from the edge of the stage. 

Waving frantically. 

It was Zeke! 



13 


I knew I was in major trouble. 

If Zeke was standing way over there, who was shaking my shoulders, 
grinning at me through the ugly mask? 

“Help! Somebody—help me!” I screamed, struggling to free myself. 

“No, Brooke!” Ms. Walker called out to me. “The line is, ‘Help. Help me, 
Father. ’ ” 

She didn’t get it. 

Couldn’t she see that there was a real phantom up here trying to shake me 
to death? 

Suddenly, the Phantom lowered his masked face and whispered harshly in 
my ear, “Stay away. Stay away from my home sweet home!” 

I gazed into his eyes. 

They looked familiar to me. 

Who was he? I knew I’d seen him before. 

But before I could remember, he spun away from me, took a diving leap off 
the stage, and ran up the long aisle, his cape flowing behind him. 

I stood watching in horror as he disappeared out through the auditorium 
doors. 

Some kids laughed. I heard Tina mutter to someone, “Was that in the 
script?” 

Zeke came running over to me. “Brookie, are you all right?” 

“I—I don’t know,” I replied. I felt really shaken up. 

“That was weirdl” Zeke exclaimed. 

Ms. Walker came striding across the stage, swinging her clipboard in one 
hand. She had a very confused expression on her face. “Can anyone explain 
what just happened here?” she asked. 

“There’s a real phantom in this school,” Zeke said softly. He narrowed his eyes 
at me thoughtfully. 

We were sitting in the front row of the auditorium. Brian scraped at a 
smudge of black paint on the back of his hand. I sat between the two boys, 
studying Zeke. 



The lights had been dimmed. Rehearsal had ended a few minutes before. I 
could hear a few voices out in the hall. The door had just closed behind Ms. 
Walker. 

“Why are you staring at me like that?” Zeke demanded. 

“I’m still wondering if you aren’t responsible for everything ,” I told him 
bluntly. 

He rolled his eyes. “Yeah. Sure,” he muttered. “How could I be in two 
places at once today, Brooke? Answer me that. That’s pretty tricky, even for 
someone as brilliant and clever as me! ” 

I laughed. “It’s possible,” I replied. 

“I can’t get this paint off,” Brian moaned. “Look. I got it on my shirt, too.” 

“Is it washable paint?” Zeke asked. 

“How should I know?” Brian replied unhappily. “I didn’t read the label on 
the can. Do you read labels on cans?” 

“Zeke only reads cereal boxes,” I joked. 

“Will you stop kidding around?” Zeke demanded impatiently. “We’ve got a 
real phantom in this school. And for some reason, he’s trying to mess up our 
play.” 

I was still studying Zeke’s face, trying to figure out if he was telling the 
truth. “I saw you talking to Andy Seltzer this morning before school,” I told 
Zeke. “You could have planned this whole phantom thing with him. You gave 
Andy the costume, right? You told him what to do. You and Andy planned out 
the whole thing. Right?” 

Zeke’s mouth dropped open. “Huh? Why would I do that?” 

“To scare me,” I replied. “To scare everyone. To make us think there’s a 
real phantom. And then when you get us really scared, you laugh and say 
‘gotcha!’ And we all feel like total jerks.” 

A smile crossed Zeke’s face. “Wish I’d thought of that,” he murmured. “But 
I’m serious, Brooke. I know you don’t believe me, but I didn’t plan anything 
with Andy. And I didn’t—” 

Tina hopped down from the stage. I guessed she’d been working on scenery 
behind the curtain. “Are you feeling better, Brooke?” she asked coldly. 

I turned to her. “Feeling better? I’m okay. What do you mean?” 

“You looked so stressed out onstage, I thought maybe you were sick,” Tina 
replied nastily. “Are you coming down with the flu? I hear there’s a really bad 
one going around.” 



“I’m fine,” I replied curdy. 

“Is this paint washable?” Brian asked Tina. 

Tina shrugged. “Beats me. Try turpentine.” She smiled at Brian. “You’re 
doing a good job on the backdrop.” Then she turned back to me and her smile 
faded. “At least someone is doing a good job on this play.” 

Before I could reply, she turned and hurried across the aisle and out the 
auditorium door. 

“She’s praying I get the flu,” I told Zeke. “Isn’t that sick?” 

He didn’t reply. He was thinking so hard about the Phantom, I don’t think 
he even heard me. 

“Do you think Tina could be doing all these terrible things?” I asked. “Just 
to frighten me away so she can be Esmerelda?” 

“That’s crazy,” Zeke replied softly. 

“Yeah. I guess,” I agreed. 

Brian just kept trying to peel the black paint off his hand. 

“Let’s go home,” I suggested. “It’s really late. Maybe we can talk about the 
Phantom later.” I climbed to my feet. 

Zeke glared up at me. “You still don’t believe me—do you?” he accused. 
“You still think this is all some plot just to scare you.” 

“Maybe. Maybe not,” I replied, climbing over him to get to the aisle. I 
really didn’t know what to think. 

Brian got up and followed me toward the door. I turned back to Zeke, who 
was still in his seat. “Are you coming? Are you going to walk with us?” 

Zeke stood up without replying. “Yeah. I guess.” 

We were heading down the hall to our lockers when Zeke suddenly stopped. 
“Oh. I forgot,” he uttered. 

“Forgot what?” I asked. It was nearly dinnertime. I was eager to get home. 
My mom was probably wondering if I’d been mn over by a bus or something. 
Mom always imagines me run over by a bus. I don’t really know why. I never 
knew anyone who was ever run over by a bus! 

“My math book,” Zeke said. “I have to go to the office. I left it in the 
auditorium the other night. I’ve got to see if anyone turned it in.” 

“I’ll see you later,” Brian said, backing down the hall. 

“Where do you live?” I called to him. 

He pointed in a direction. South, I think. “See you tomorrow!” He turned 
and jogged around the corner. 



I followed Zeke to Mr. Levy’s office. All the lights were on, but the office 
was empty, except for Dot, the secretary. She was shutting down her computer, 
getting ready to go home. 

“Did anyone turn in my math book?” Zeke asked her, leaning on the 
counter. 

“Math book?” She squinted back at Zeke thoughtfully. 

“I left it in the auditorium the other night,” Zeke said. “I thought maybe that 
guy Emile turned it in.” 

Dot’s expression turned to confusion. “Who? Who is Emile?” 

“You know,” Zeke replied. “The little old guy with the white hair. The night 
janitor.” 

Dot shook her head. “You’re a little mixed up, Zeke,” she said. “There’s no 
one named Emile who works at the school. We don’t have a night janitor.”

Tina Powell called me at home that night. “Just wanted to see how you’re 
feeling,” she said. “You looked so pale, Brooke.” 

“I’m not getting the flu!” I shouted. I really lost my cool. But I couldn’t 
help it. 

“I heard you sneezing a lot yesterday,” Tina said, pretending to be 
concerned. 

“I always sneeze a lot,” I replied. “Bye, Tina.” 

“Who was that other phantom who jumped onstage this afternoon?” Tina 
asked before I could hang up. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “I really—” 

“That was kind of scary,” Tina interrupted. “I hope you weren’t too scared 
or anything, Brooke.” 

“See you tomorrow, Tina,” I said coldly. 

I hung up the phone before she could say anything else. Tina was really 
becoming a pain, I decided. 

How much does she want to play Esmerelda? I found myself wondering. 

Just how much does she want the part? Enough to try to scare me away? 

Zeke called later and convinced me that Emile had to be our phantom. “He lied 
to us, right?” Zeke asked excitedly. “He told us he worked for the school. And he 
tried to frighten us. It’s got to be him,” Zeke insisted. 

“Yeah. Probably,” I replied, twirling the hair scrunchie on my wrist. 

“He’s the right size,” Zeke continued. “And he knew about the trapdoor.” 
Zeke took a breath. “And why was he there, Brookie? Why was he there in the 
auditorium at night?” 

“Because he’s the Phantom?” I asked. 

It made sense. 

I agreed to get to school early so that Zeke and I could tell Ms. Walker 
about Emile. 

That night I dreamed about the play. I was onstage in my costume. The 
spotlights were all on me. I stared out at the seats, filled with people. 

The auditorium grew silent. Everyone was waiting for Esmerelda to speak. 



I opened my mouth—and realized I didn’t remember what I was supposed 
to say. 

I stared out at the faces of the audience. 

I had forgotten everything. Every word. Every line. 

The words had all flown away, like birds leaving a nest. 

My nest was empty. My mind was a total blank. 

I stood there in panic. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak. 

I woke up in a cold sweat. My entire body trembled. My muscles had all 
knotted up. I had kicked all the covers onto the floor. 

What a horrible dream. 

I couldn’t wait to get dressed and get to school. I wanted to forget about 
that awful nightmare as quickly as I could. 

I had to walk Jeremy to school. So I didn’t get there as early as I wanted. 

Jeremy kept asking me about the play. He wanted to hear more about the 
Phantom. But I really didn’t feel like talking about it. I kept remembering my 
dream, remembering the panic of standing in front of three hundred people and 
looking like a total jerk. 

I dropped Jeremy off, then hurried across the street. I found Zeke waiting 
for me by the front door. He was staring impatiently at his watch. 

I don’t know why. It doesn’t have the correct time on it. It’s one of those 
digital watches with seventeen different controls on it. Zeke can’t figure out how 
to set it. He can play games on it—and play a dozen different songs. But he can’t 
get it to tell the time. 

“Sorry I’m late,” I said. 

He grabbed my arm and pulled me right into the classroom. He wouldn’t 
even let me get my books from my locker or take off my coat. 

We marched up to Ms. Walker, who was sitting behind her desk, glancing 
over the morning announcements. She smiled at us, but her smile faded as she 
saw the solemn looks on our faces. 

“Is something wrong?” Ms. Walker asked. 

“Could we speak to you?” Zeke whispered, glancing at the kids already in 
class. “In private?” 

Ms. Walker gazed up at the wall clock. “Can’t it wait? The bell is going to 
ring in two minutes.” 

“It will only take a minute,” Zeke promised. 

She followed us out into the hall and leaned her back against the tile wall. 



“What’s the problem?” 

“There’s a phantom in the school,” Zeke told her breathlessly. “A real one. 
Brooke and I have seen him.” 

“Whoa!” Ms. Walker murmured, raising both hands to say stop. 

“No! Really!” I insisted. “We did see him, Ms. Walker. In the auditorium. 
We sneaked in. To use the trapdoor, and—” 

“You did what?” she cried, narrowing her eyes first at me, then at Zeke. 

“I know, I know,” Zeke said, blushing. “We weren’t supposed to. But that’s 
not the point.” 

“There’s a phantom,” I said. “And he’s trying to stop the play.” 

“I know you think I’ve been doing all those things,” Zeke added. “But I 
haven’t. It’s the Phantom. He—” 

Ms. Walker raised her hands again. She started to say something, but the 
bell rang—right over our heads. 

We raised our hands to protect our ears. 

When the bell finally stopped clanging, Ms. Walker took a few steps toward 
the classroom door. It was really noisy inside. The kids were all taking 
advantage of her not being in there. 

“I’m sorry I upset you with that story,” she told us. 

“Huh?” Zeke and I both cried out. 

“I never should have told that old phantom story,” Ms. Walker said fretfully. 
“It got a lot of kids upset. I apologize for scaring you.” 

“But you didn’t!” Zeke protested. “We saw a guy, and—” 

“Have you been having nightmares about a phantom?” Ms. Walker 
demanded. 

She didn’t believe us. She didn’t believe a word we had said. 

“Listen—” I started. 

All three of us jumped when we heard a loud crash inside the room. A crash 
followed by wild laughter. 

“Let’s get inside,” Ms. Walker said. She pointed at Zeke. “No more 
practical jokes—okay? No more jokes. We want the play to be good, don’t we?” 
Before we could answer, she turned and hurried into the room. 

“What am I doing here?” Brian moaned. He shivered and stared up at the dark 
trees. “Why am I doing this?” 

“You came with us because you’re a nice guy,” I told him, patting the 



shoulder of his sweater. 

“No. Because I’m an idiot!” Brian corrected me. 

This was all Zeke’s idea. He came to my house after dinner. I told my 
parents we had our play rehearsal. A lie. 

Then Zeke and I walked to school. We met Brian on the front walk, where 
he’d promised to wait for us. 

“I can’t believe Ms. Walker didn’t believe us,” Zeke fretted. 

“Would you believe such a nutty story?” I demanded. 

“Well, we’re going to find the Phantom and prove we’re right,” Zeke said 
firmly. “We have no choice now. I mean, if Ms. Walker won’t help us, we’ll have 
to find him on our own.” 

“You just like a good adventure,” I teased him. 

He raised his eyes to mine. “Well, Brookie, if you’re too scared...” 

“But what am / doing here?” Brian repeated, staring at the dark school 
building. 

“We need all the help we can get!” I told him. 

I gave Zeke a shove. “Let’s go. I’ll show you who’s scared and who isn’t.” 

“I think I’m a little scared,” Brian admitted. “What if we get caught?” 

“Who’s going to catch us?” Zeke asked him. “You heard what Dot said in 
the office. There’s no night janitor.” 

“But what if there’s an alarm or something?” Brian demanded. “You know. 
A burglar alarm.” 

“For sure,” I replied, rolling my eyes. “Our school can’t even afford pencil 
sharpeners! No way they’ve got burglar alarms.” 

“Well, we’re going to have to break in,” Zeke said quietly, his eyes on the 
street. A station wagon rolled by without slowing. He tugged at the front doors 
again. “They’re locked tight.” 

“Maybe a side door?” Brian suggested. 

We crept around to the side of the building. The playground stretched out, 
silent and empty. The grass glowed all silvery under the bright half-moon. 

The side doors were locked, too. 

And the back door that led into the band room was also locked. 

I raised my eyes to the roof. The building hovered over us like some kind of 
dark creature. The windows reflected the white moonlight. It was the only light I 
could see. 

“Hey—that window is open!” Zeke whispered. 



We ran full speed up to the half-open window in a ground-floor classroom. 
It was the home ec room, I saw. Mrs. Lamston probably left the window open to 
let out the horrible smell of the muffins we baked that afternoon. 

Zeke raised both hands to the window ledge and hoisted himself up. Sitting 
on the ledge, he pushed the window open wider. 

A few seconds later, Brian and I followed him into the home ec room. The 
aroma of burned cranberry muffins lingered in the air. We tiptoed through the 
darkness to the door. 

“Ouch!” I cried out as I banged my thigh into a low table. 

“Be quiet!” Zeke scolded. 

“Hey—I didn’t do it on purpose!” I whispered back angrily. 

He was already out the door. Brian and I followed, moving slowly, 
carefully. 

The hall was even darker than the classroom. We kept pressed against the 
wall as we made our way toward the auditorium. 

My heart was racing. I felt all tingly. My shoes scraped loudly over the hard 
floor. 

Nothing to be afraid of, I told myself. It’s just the school building, the 
building you’ve been in a million times. And there’s no one else here. 

Just you. Zeke. Brian. And a phantom. 

A phantom who doesn’t want to be found. 

“I don’t think I like this,” Brian whispered as we edged our way around a 
corner. “I’m really pretty scared.” 

“Just pretend you’re in a scary movie,” I told him. “Pretend it’s just a 
movie.” 

“But I don’t like scary movies!” he protested. 

“Ssshhh,” Zeke warned. He stopped suddenly. I bumped right into him. 
“Try not to be a klutz, Brookie,” he whispered. 

“Try not to be a jerk, Zekey,” I replied nastily. 

I squinted into the darkness. We had reached the auditorium. 

Zeke pulled open the nearest door. We peered inside. Total blackness. The 
air in the auditorium felt cooler. 

Cool and damp. 

That’s because a ghost lives in here, I thought. 

That made my heart pump even harder. I wished I could control my 
thoughts a little better. 



Zeke fumbled with his hand against the wall and clicked on a row of lights 
over the section of seats to our left. The stage came into view. Empty and silent. 
Someone had left a ladder leaning against one wall. Several paint cans were 
lined up beside the ladder. 

“How about turning on ah the lights?” Brian suggested. He sounded really 
frightened. 

“No way,” Zeke replied, his eyes on the stage. “We want to take the 
Phantom by surprise, don’t we? We don’t want to warn him that we’re coming.” 

Huddled close together, we made our way slowly down the center aisle 
toward the stage. In the dim light, long shadows fell over the seats. 

Ghostly shadows, I thought. 

Did a shadow move near the stage? 

No. 

Stop it, Brooke, I scolded myself. Don’t let your imagination go wild. Not 
tonight. 

I kept moving my eyes back and forth, checking out the stage and the rows 
of seats as we slowly made our way to the front. 

Where is he? I wondered. Where is the Phantom? 

Does he live in that dark chamber so far below the stage? 

We were just a few feet from the stage when we heard the sound. 

A footstep? A floorboard creaking? 

All three of us stopped. A11 three of us heard it. 

I grabbed Zeke’s arm. I saw Brian’s green eyes go wide with fright. 

And then we heard another sound. A cough. 

“We’re... n-not alone!” I stammered. 



15 


“Wh-who’s there?” I called. But my voice caught in my throat. 

“Is anybody up there?” Zeke called to the stage. 

No reply. 

Another footstep. 

Brian took a step back. He grabbed the back of a seat and held on. 

“He’s back there,” Zeke said, leaning close to me, his eyes excited. “I know 
he’s back there.” 

“Where?” I demanded, choking out the word. It was hard to talk with my 
heart in my throat. 

I stared up at the stage. I couldn’t see anyone. 

I jumped when I heard another cough. 

And then a clanking sound rose up over the stage and echoed through the 
auditorium. 

At first I thought the trapdoor was about to move. 

Was someone riding up on it? Was the Phantom about to rise in front of our 
eyes? 

No. 

I cried out when I saw the backdrop begin to unfurl. 

The clanking sound grew louder. The backdrop was slowly being lowered 
at the back of the stage. 

“Who is doing it?” I whispered. “Who on earth is sending it down?” 

Zeke and Brian stared straight ahead and didn’t reply. 

Zeke’s mouth was wide open. His eyes didn’t blink. 

Brian gripped the back of the chair with both hands. 

The painted backdrop clanked down, unrolling as it lowered. 

All three of us gasped as we saw what had been done to it. 

It had been a gray brick theater wall. Brian and several other kids had 
worked for days on it, sketching it out, then painting it brick by brick. 

“Who—who did that to my painting?” Brian cried out. 

Zeke and I remained staring at it in silent horror. 

The gray wall had been covered with red paint splotches and thick, red 



smears. 

It looked as if someone had dipped a wide brush in red paint, then smeared 
and stabbed it all over the backdrop. 

“It’s mined!” Brian declared shrilly. 

Zeke was the first to move. He raised his hands to the stage floor and pulled 
himself up onto the stage. Brian and I followed after him. 

“Who’s here?” Zeke called out, cupping his hands around his mouth. 
“Who’s in here?” 

Silence. 

Someone is here, I knew. Someone had to lower that backdrop so that we 
could see what had been done to it. 

“Who’s here? Where are you?” Zeke repeated. 

Again, no reply. 

We moved closer, making our way slowly, keeping close together. 

And as we stepped up to it, words came into view. They were scrawled 
across the bottom, thick letters in heavy red paint. 

I stopped and squinted to read the message in the dim light: 

STAY AWAY FROM MY 
HOME SWEET HOME. 

“Whoa,” I murmured. I felt a chill roll down my back. 

Then I heard a side door being pulled open. 

All three of us turned away from the backdrop in time to see a figure step 
into the auditorium. 

We cried out in surprise when we saw who it was. 



16 


She stood gaping up at us. She blinked her eyes several times, as if she didn’t 
believe what she was seeing. 

“I—I am really shocked,” Ms. Walker said finally. 

I swallowed hard. I stmggled to say something, but no sound would come 
out. 

Zeke and Brian stood frozen like me. 

“I am so disappointed in all three of you,” Ms. Walker said, stepping closer. 
“Breaking and entering is a serious crime. And the three of you have no business 

She stopped short and let out a little gurgle as her eyes fell on the backdrop. 
She had been so surprised to find Zeke, Brian, and me onstage, she hadn’t seen it 
—until now. 

“Oh, no! Oh good heavens!” she cried, raising both hands to her face. She 
tilted. Sort of toppled from side to side. I thought she was about to fall over! 

“How could you?” she gasped. She hurried across the stage, her eyes on the 
paint-splotched backdrop. “How could you ruin it? All the students worked for 
so many days to get it right. How could you ruin it for everyone?” 

“We didn’t,” Zeke said quietly. 

“We didn’t do it,” I repeated. 

She shook her head hard, as if trying to shake us away. “I’m afraid I’ve 
caught you red-handed,” she said quietly, almost sadly. I saw tears brim in her 
eyes. 

“Ms. Walker, really—” I started. 

She raised a hand to stop me. “Was it so important to you three to have your 
little joke?” she asked, her voice trembling. 

“Ms. Walker—” 

“Was it so important to make everyone believe there is a phantom? So 
important that you broke into the school—committed a serious crime—and then 
completely destroyed the scenery for our play? Was your joke so important?” 

“We really didn’t do it,” I insisted, my voice trembling, too. 

Ms. Walker stepped forward and rubbed a finger over a red paint splotch on 
the backdrop. When she pulled the finger away, it was smeared with red paint. 



“The paint is still wet,” she said, her eyes burning accusingly into mine. 
“There’s no one else here. Are you going to keep lying to me all night?” 

“If you’d just give us a chance—” Zeke started. 

“I’m especially disappointed in you, Brian,” Ms. Walker said, shaking her 
head, a frown tightening her features. “You just started at this school a week or 
so ago. You should be on your best behavior.” 

Brian blushed redder than I’ve ever seen a human blush. He lowered his 
eyes, as if he were guilty. 

I took a deep breath. “Ms. Walker, you have to let us explain!” I cried 
shrilly. “We really didn’t do this! We found it like this! Really!” 

Ms. Walker opened her mouth to speak, but changed her mind. “Okay.” She 
crossed her arms over her skinny chest. “Go ahead. But I want the truth. ” 

“The truth,” I said. I raised my right hand, as if swearing an oath. “Brian, 
Zeke and I did sneak into the school. We didn’t really break in. We climbed in 
through a window.” 

“Why?” Ms. Walker demanded sternly. “What are you doing here? Why 
aren’t you home where you should be?” 

“We came to look for the Phantom,” Zeke broke in. He swept his blond hair 
back with one hand. He always did that to his hair when he was really tense. 

“We told you about the Phantom this morning, but you didn’t believe us.” 

“Of course I didn’t believe you!” Ms. Walker declared. “It’s an old legend. 
Just a story.” She frowned at Zeke. 

Zeke let out a frustrated sigh. “We saw the Phantom, Ms. Walker. Brooke 
and I. We saw him. He’s the one who painted all over the backdrop. Not us. He’s 
the one who swung down from the catwalk. And grabbed Brooke at rehearsal.” 

“Why should I believe that?” Ms. Walker demanded, her arms still tightly 
crossed in front her. 

“Because it’s true,” I said. “Zeke, Brian, and I—we came to the auditorium 
to look for the Phantom.” 

“Where were you going to look for him?” Ms. Walker asked. 

“Well,” Zeke stammered. “Probably underneath the stage.” 

“You were going to take the trapdoor down?” Ms. Walker asked. 

I nodded. “Maybe. If we had to.” 

“But I clearly instructed everyone to stay away from the trapdoor,” she said. 

“I know,” I told her. “And I’m sorry. We’re all sorry. But we are really 
desperate to find the Phantom, to prove to you that he is real, that we’re not 



making him up.” 

Her expression remained hard. She continued to glare at us. “I haven’t 
heard anything to convince me,” she said. 

“When we got here, we heard some noises,” Zeke told her, shifting 
uncomfortably from foot to foot. “Footsteps. Floorboards creaking. So we knew 
someone else was here.” 

“And then the backdrop started to come down,” Brian broke in, his voice 
shaky and small. “We just stood here and watched it, Ms. Walker. That’s the 
truth. And then when we saw how it was messed up, we... we couldn’t believe 
it!” 

Ms. Walker’s expression softened a little. Brian sounded so upset, I think 
she was starting to believe him. 

“I worked so hard on that backdrop,” Brian continued. “It was the first 
thing I ever worked on at this school, and I wanted it to be good. I wouldn’t 
wreck my own backdrop for a dumb joke. I really wouldn’t.” 

Ms. Walker uncrossed her arms. She glanced at each of us, then returned 
her eyes to the backdrop. Her lips silently formed the words of the scrawled 
message: 


STAY AWAY FROM MY 
HOME SWEET HOME. 

She shut her eyes and kept them shut for a long moment. Then she turned 
back to us. “I want to believe you,” she confessed with a sigh. “But I just don’t 
know.” 

She began to pace back and forth in front of us. “I drove back to school 
because I’d forgotten your math test papers. I heard voices in the auditorium. I 
come in here, and I find you on the stage. The scenery totally smeared and 
destroyed. The paint still wet. And you ask me to believe that a mysterious 
phantom from over seventy years ago is responsible.” 

I didn’t say a word. Neither did Zeke or Brian. I don’t think we had 
anything more to say. 

“The weird thing is, I’m starting to believe you,” Ms. Walker said, 
frowning. 

The three of us let out relieved sighs. 

“At least, I’m starting to believe that you didn’t paint on the backdrop.” She 



shook her hair hard. Her skinny body shuddered. “It’s getting late,” she said 
softly. “Let’s all go home. I need to think about this. Maybe we need to ask Mr. 
Levy for an investigation. Maybe he can help us find the culprit who is trying to 
ruin our play.” 

Oh, no, I thought. Not the principal. What if he decides to cancel our play? 
But I didn’t say anything. None of us did. We didn’t even look at one another. 
We followed Ms. Walker out into the hall. 

I was just so relieved that she had started to believe us. And that she was 
letting us go. 

She clicked on a hall light so we could see our way. 

We took a few steps, walking behind her. 

Then we all stopped at once. 

We all saw the red paint spots on the hall floor. A trail of red paint spots. 

“Well, look at this!” Ms. Walker declared. “Our painter was a little careless. 
He or she left a trail to follow.” 

She clicked on more lights. 

We followed the red paint splotches down the long hall. We could clearly 
see a shoe print in one of the bigger paint puddles. 

“I don’t believe this!” Zeke whispered to me. “Someone left a trail.” 

“I’m glad,” I whispered back. “Maybe the paint drips will lead us to the one 
who splotched up the backdrop.” 

“You mean the Phantom?” Zeke whispered. 

We turned a corner. We passed a small paint smear. 

“At least this will prove to Ms. Walker that we’re telling the truth,” Brian 
said softly. 

We turned another corner. 

The paint trail stopped suddenly. One last tiny red puddle stood in front of a 
locker. 

“Hmmmm,” Ms. Walker said thoughtfully, moving her eyes from the paint 
smear to the locker. “The trail seems to lead right to here.” 

“Hey!” Zeke cried out, startling all of us. I could see his eyes go wide with 
shock. “That’s my locker!” 



17 


No one said anything for a moment. 

I could hear Zeke’s breaths, short and fast. I turned to him. He was staring 
at his locker, staring hard at the gray metal door as if he could see inside. 

“Open your locker, Zeke,” Ms. Walker instructed. She said it through 
gritted teeth. 

“Huh?” Zeke gaped at her, as if he didn’t understand what she meant. He 
lowered his eyes to the smear of red paint on the floor under his locker door. 

“Go ahead. Open your locker,” Ms. Walker repeated patiently. She suddenly 
looked very tired. 

Zeke hesitated. “But there’s nothing in there,” he protested. “Just books and 
notebooks and stuff.” 

“Please.” Ms. Walker motioned to the combination lock with one hand. 
“Please, Zeke. It’s really late.” 

“But you don’t think—?” Zeke started. 

Ms. Walker motioned to the lock again. 

“Maybe somebody wanted to make it look like Zeke was the one with the 
paint,” I suggested. “Maybe someone deliberately made that trail of paint lead to 
Zeke’s locker.” 

“Maybe,” Ms. Walker replied calmly. “That’s why I want him to open his 
locker.” 

“Okay, okay,” Zeke muttered. His hand shook as he reached for the 
combination lock. He leaned his head forward and concentrated as he spun the 
dial, first one direction, then the other. 

“Give me some light,” he said edgily. 

I backed up. “Sorry.” I didn’t realize I was standing in his light. 

I glanced at Brian. He had his hands shoved in his pockets. He leaned 
against the wall and stared intently at Zeke’s hands as Zeke twirled the lock. 

Finally, Zeke pulled the lock open with a loud click. 

He lifted the handle and pulled open the door. 

I leaned forward to peer inside at the same time as Ms. Walker. We nearly 
bumped heads. 

We both saw the can of paint at the same time. 



A small can of red paint resting on the locker floor. 

The lid wasn’t on tight. Splashes of red paint dripped over the side of the 

can. 

“But it isn’t mine!” Zeke wailed. 

Ms. Walker let out a long sigh. “I’m sorry, Zeke.” 

“It isn’t mine!” Zeke whined. “Really, Ms. Walker! It isn’t!” 

“I’m going to call your parents to come in for a serious talk,” Ms. Walker 
said, biting her lower lip. “And, of course, you’re out of the play.” 

“Oh, nooo!” Zeke moaned. He slammed the locker door shut as hard as he 
could. The crash echoed down the long, empty hall. 

Ms. Walker flinched from the sound. She flashed Zeke an angry look. Then 
she turned to Brian and me. “So you two were also involved? Tell the truth!” 

“No!” Brian and I both called out. “We didn’t do it,” I added. I started to 
say, “Neither did Zeke.” 

But I could see that it was too late. There was no way to argue against the 
can of paint in the locker. 

Zeke was a cooked goose. 

“If I find out that you and Brian had anything to do with it, I’ll remove you 
from the play and call your parents in, too,” Ms. Walker threatened. “Now go 
home. All of you.” 

We turned and trudged out the door without another word. 

The night air felt cold against my hot skin. I shivered. 

The half-moon was covered by a sheet of gray mist. The mist looked like a 
ghostly figure floating over the moon. 

I followed Zeke and Brian down the concrete steps. A gust of wind made 
my jacket flap behind me. 

“Do you believe it?” Zeke muttered angrily. “Do you believe it?” 

“No,” I replied, shaking my head. Poor Zeke. I could see he was really 
messed up. And when his parents got that call from Ms. Walker, Zeke was going 
to be even more messed up! 

“How did that paint get in your locker?” Brian asked him, his eyes peering 
into Zeke’s. 

Zeke turned away. “How should I know?” he snapped. 

We made our way to the sidewalk. Zeke angrily kicked an empty cardboard 
juice box into the street. 

“See you tomorrow, I guess,” Brian said unhappily. He gave us a little 



wave, then turned and started walking slowly toward his house. 

Zeke jogged off in the other direction. 

“Aren’t you going to walk home with me?” I called. 

“No,” he shouted back, and kept going. 

In a way I was glad he had left. I didn’t really know what to say to him. 

I just felt so bad. 

I started walking slowly, my head down, thinking hard, when I saw a small, 
round light floating toward me through the darkness. 

The light grew bigger. I realized it was a bicycle headlight. The bike turned 
out of the school parking lot and rolled smoothly, steadily toward me. 

When it was a few feet away, I recognized the bike rider. “Tina!” I cried in 
surprise. “What are you doing here?” 

She squealed to a stop, bouncing in the seat. Her dark eyes caught the light 
of the streetlamp above us. She smiled. An odd smile. 

“Hi, Brooke. How’s it going?” she asked. 

Was she in the school? I wondered. Did she just come out of the school? 

“Where’d you come from?” I repeated. 

Her strange smile remained on her face. “A friend’s,” she said. “I’m just 
coming from a friend’s.” 

“Were you in the school?” I blurted out. 

“The school? No. Not me,” she replied. She shifted her weight, then raised 
her feet to the pedals. “Better zip up that jacket, Brooke,” she said. “You don’t 
want to catch a cold, do you?”

On Saturday we had play rehearsals all day long in the auditorium. The 
performance was only a week away. 

We all worked hard, and the rehearsal went well. I only forgot my lines 
twice. 

But it wasn’t the same without Zeke. 

Robert Hernandez had taken Zeke’s place. I like Robert, but he’s a very 
serious guy. He doesn’t get my jokes, and he doesn’t like to kid around or be 
kidded. 

After lunch, Robert and Corey were rehearsing a scene together. Ms. 
Walker still hadn’t returned from lunch. 

I wandered over to Brian. He had a paintbrush in his hand, dripping with 
black paint. He was leaning over the new backdrop, putting some final touches 
on the gray bricks. 

“Looks good,” I told him. I had a sudden urge to slap him on the back and 
make him smear black paint all over. But I decided that might not go over too 
well. 

I don’t know where these sudden urges come from. 

“How’s it going?” Brian asked without looking up. He was filling in some 
spots he had missed. 

“Okay, I guess,” I replied. Across the stage, I saw Tina working with a large 
glue pot. She was brushing a thick layer of glue onto a cardboard chandelier. 

“Robert is going to be a good phantom,” Brian said, scratching his chin 
with the tip of the paintbrush handle. 

“Yeah,” I agreed. “But I kind of miss Zeke.” 

Brian nodded. Then he turned to look up at me. “You know what? There 
hasn’t been one practical joke since Zeke left. No scenery ruined. No mysterious 
phantoms leaping out at us. No threatening words scrawled on the walls. 
Nothing. Nothing bad since Ms. Walker kicked Zeke out.” 

I hadn’t thought about it until that second. But Brian was right. Ever since 
Zeke had been removed from the play, the Phantom had totally disappeared. 

Everything had been going so smoothly. I hadn’t even stopped to realize it. 

Did this mean that Zeke actually was the Phantom? That Zeke had been 



doing all those horrible things after all? 

“Did Zeke’s parents have a cow when Ms. Walker called them in to 
school?” Brian asked. “Did he get punished?” 

“For sure,” I replied, still thinking about the Phantom. “His parents 
grounded him for life. And they took away his VCR. That means no horror 
movies. Zeke can’t live without horror movies!” 

Brian snickered. “Maybe Zeke has seen too many horror movies,” he said. 

“Okay, people!” a voice called loudly. I turned to see that Ms. Walker had 
returned from lunch. “Let’s take it from the opening of Act Two,” she called. 
“We’ll do the whole act.” 

I said good-bye to Brian and hurried to the front of the stage. Esmerelda 
was in just about every scene of Act Two. This time, I was determined to 
remember every word. 

As I stepped beside Robert, I saw Ms. Walker pick up her script from the 
table where she always left it. She grasped it in both hands and started to open it 
to Act Two. 

I watched her expression change as her hands worked at the script. She let 
out a short, angry cry. Then she tugged some more at the thick script. 

“Hey—” she shouted angrily. “Now who’s the joker?” 

“Ms. Walker, what’s wrong?” Robert called. 

She raised the script and shook it furiously. 

“The pages of my script—they’ve all been glued together!” she fumed. 

Startled gasps rose up around the stage. 

“That’s it!” Ms. Walker cried. She heaved the script at the wall. “That was 
the last joke! The play is canceled! Everybody go home! It’s canceled!”

“Did Ms. Walker change her mind?” Zeke asked. 

I nodded. “Yeah. She calmed down after a few seconds and said the play 
could go on. But she was in a really bad mood for the rest of the day.” 

“At least this time she couldn’t blame me,” Zeke said quietly. He tossed a 
pink rubber ball across the living room, and Buster, his black cocker spaniel, 
went scrambling after it. 

Brian and I had dropped by Zeke’s house to tell him how things were going. 
Zeke was grounded—probably forever—and couldn’t leave the house. His 
parents were at the movies. They’d be home in a few hours. 

Buster dropped the ball and started barking at Brian. 

Zeke laughed. “He doesn’t like you, Brian.” He picked up the ball and 
bounced it over the carpet again. 

But Buster ignored the ball and kept barking at Brian. 

Brian blushed. He reached out to pet the dog’s head. “What’s your problem, 
fella? I’m not a bad guy.” 

Buster scampered away from Brian and crossed the room to search for the 
ball, which had rolled into the hallway. 

“Well, I guess this proves there’s some other joker in the class,” Zeke said, 
his smile fading. He settled back on the couch. “Guess this proves that it wasn’t 
me doing all the bad things.” 

I started to make a joke, but I caught the serious expression on Zeke’s face. 
So I didn’t say anything. 

“There’s a phantom, and it isn’t me,” Zeke said. “And now everyone thinks 
I’m a liar. Ms. Walker thinks I tried to ruin the play. Even my parents think I’ve 
turned into a bad guy.” 

“You were a much better phantom than Robert,” I said, trying to cheer him 
up. “There’s less than a week to go, and Robert still keeps messing up his lines. 
He says he’s sorry he tried out for the play. He doesn’t even want to be in it 
now.” 

Zeke jumped to his feet. “If we could prove that I’m not the Phantom, I’ll 
bet Ms. Walker would give the part back to me.” 

“Uh-oh,” I said. I could see Zeke’s mind working. I knew what he was 



going to say next. 

“Uh-oh,” Brian echoed. He also knew what Zeke was going to say. 

“Let’s go to school,” Zeke said, his eyes wide with excitement. “Let’s find 
the Phantom this time. I really want to get my part back.” 

I shook my head. “No way, Zeke—” I started. 

“I really want to show everyone that I didn’t try to min the play,” Zeke 
insisted. 

Brian tossed the ball to the dog. The dog watched it bounce away. “But 
you’re grounded, remember?” Brian said to Zeke. 

Zeke shrugged. “If we find the Phantom and prove that I’m innocent, my 
parents will be glad I went. And I won’t be grounded anymore. Come on, guys. 
One more try. Please?” 

I stared back at Zeke, thinking hard. I didn’t think it was a good idea. The 
last time we sneaked into the auditorium, we ended up in major trouble. 

I could see by Brian’s expression that he didn’t want to go, either. 

But how could we say no to Zeke? He was practically begging us! 

It was a warm night, but I felt chilled just the same. As we walked to school, I 
kept seeing shadows moving close as if reaching for us. But when I turned to see 
them, they vanished. 

Brooke, you have too much imagination, I scolded myself. 

I wished my heart would stop thudding like a bass drum. 

I wished I were home, watching TV with Jeremy. I had a bad feeling about 
our little adventure. Avery bad feeling. 

We didn’t waste any time trying the doors. We climbed into the school 
through the same home ec room window. Then, once again we made our way 
silently down the dark halls to the auditorium. 

One row of lights had been left on at the back of the seats. The stage lay 
dark and bare, except for the gray brick backdrop against the back wall. 

Zeke led the way down the center aisle. He had given us each a flashlight. 
We clicked them on as we made our way to the stage. The beams of light played 
over the empty rows of seats. I raised mine to the stage and swept it from side to 
side. 

No one up there. No sign of anything unusual. 

“Zeke, this is a waste of time,” I said, whispering even though no one could 
hear us. 



He raised a finger to his lips. “We’re going down below the stage,” Zeke 
said quietly, his eyes straight ahead. “And we’re going to find him, Brooke. This 
time, we’re going to find him.” 

I had never seen Zeke so serious, so determined. A chill of fear went slowly 
down my back. But I decided not to argue with him. 

“Uh... maybe I should stay up on the stage while you two go down,” Brian 
suggested. “I could stand guard.” 

“Stand guard against what?” Zeke demanded, raising his flashlight to 
Brian’s face. 

I could see Brian’s frightened expression. “Against... anyone who might 
come,” he replied weakly. 

“All three of us have to go down,” Zeke insisted. “If we do find the 
Phantom, I want two witnesses—you and Brooke.” 

“But the Phantom is a qhost —right?” Brian demanded. “How do we find a 
ghost?” 

Zeke glared at him. “We’ll find him.” 

Brian shrugged. We could both see that there was no point in arguing with 
Zeke tonight. 

The floorboards on the stage creaked as we made our way to the trapdoor. 
Our flashlights moved over the outline of the square platform in the floor. 

Brian and I huddled close together in the center of the square. Zeke 
stomped hard on the little wooden peg, then jumped beside us. 

We heard the familiar clanking sound. Then the gentle hum as the platform 
started to lower. The stage appeared to rise up all around us. In a few seconds, 
we were surrounded by four black walls. 

The light from our flashlights washed over the walls as we sank lower and 
lower under the stage. My heart felt as if it were sinking, too—down to my 
knees! 

The three of us stood pressed together in the center of the platform. The 
clanking and grinding sounds grew louder as we went down. Finally, we hit the 
bottom with a hard thud. 

For a few seconds, none of us moved. 

Zeke was the first to step off the platform. He raised his flashlight and 
swept it slowly around. We were in the middle of a large, empty chamber. It 
tunneled out in two directions. 

“Here, Phantom! Here, boy!” Zeke called softly, as if calling his dog. 



“Here, Phantom. Where are you, Phantom?” he called in a singsong voice. 

I stepped off the platform and gave him a shove. “Stop it,” I insisted. “I 
thought you were serious about this. Why are you making a joke of it?” 

“Just trying to keep you from getting too scared,” Zeke replied. But, of 
course, I knew the truth. He was trying to keep himself from getting too scared. 

I turned back to Brian. In the dim light, he looked scared enough for both of 
us! “There’s no one down here. Can we go back up now?” he pleaded. 

“No way,” Zeke told him. “Follow me. Keep your light down on the ground 
so we can see where we’re going.” 

Walking side by side, Brian and I followed Zeke into the chamber. We 
stepped into a long tunnel, took a few steps, then stopped to listen. 

Silence. 

My legs were trembling. In fact, my entire body was shaking. But Zeke was 
acting so brave. There was no way I’d let him know how frightened I was. 

“This tunnel probably stretches all the way under the school,” Zeke 
whispered, moving his light ahead of us. “Maybe even farther. Maybe it goes 
under the entire block!” 

We took another few steps—then stopped when we heard a noise behind us. 

A clanking, followed by a loud hum. 

“Hey!” Brian cried out shrilly. “The trapdoor!” 

All three of us spun around and started running back toward it. Our heavy 
footsteps echoed loudly through the dark tunnel. 

My chest was aching so hard by the time we got back to the trapdoor 
platform, I could hardly breathe. 

“It—it’s going back up!” Zeke cried. 

We stood there helplessly, gazing at the platform as it rose over our heads, 
climbing back up to the stage. 

“Push the switch!” Zeke cried to me. “Bring it back down!” 

I fumbled on the wall till I found the switch. I tried to move it. But it was 
stuck. 

No. It had been locked. 

It wouldn’t budge. 

The trapdoor platform stopped high above us. 

A heavy silence fell over the three of us as we stared up in the darkness. 

“Zeke, now we’re trapped down here,” I uttered. “There’s no way back up. 
We’re totally trapped.” 



20 


We waited to see if someone was coming down. But the trapdoor remained 
closed up there. 

Brian let out a frightened sigh. “Somebody did it,” he whispered, staring up 
to the platform. “Somebody pushed the switch and sent it back up.” 

“The Phantom!” I cried. I turned to Zeke. “Now what?” 

Zeke shrugged. “Now we have no choice. If we want to get out of here, we 
have to find the Phantom!” 

Our circles of yellow light trembled over the floor as we turned and headed 
back into the tunnel. No one said a word as we followed it around one curve, 
then another. 

The floor became soft and muddy. The air grew cooler. 

I heard a soft, chittering sound in the distance. I hoped it wasn’t a bat. 

Brian and I had to hurry to keep up with Zeke. 

He was taking long strides, his flashlight swinging back and forth in front 
of him. 

Suddenly, I heard low, musical humming. It took me a while to realize it 
was coming from Zeke. He was humming a tune to himself. 

Come on, Zeke, give me a break! I thought. You’ve got to be scared! You 
can’t fool me with a little cheerful humming. You are as scared as I am! 

I started to tease him about it. But the tunnel suddenly ended, and we found 
ourselves at a low doorway. Brian hung back. But Zeke and I stepped up to the 
door, our flashlights beaming over it. 

“Anyone in there?” Zeke called in a strange, tiny voice. 

No reply. 

I reached out and pushed the door. It creaked open. Zeke and I raised our 
flashlights and aimed them inside. 

A room. All furnished. I saw a folding chair. A beat-up couch with one of 
the cushions missing. Bookshelves along one wall. 

My flashlight fell over a small table. A bowl and a box of cornflakes stood 
on the table. I swept the light around and saw a small, unmade bed against the 
far wall. 

Zeke and Brian followed me into the room. Our beams of light slid slowly 



over every object, every piece of furniture. An old-fashioned record player stood 
on a low table. A stack of old records was piled beside it. 

“Do you believe this?” Zeke whispered. A grin spread over his face. 

“I think we’ve found the Phantom’s home,” I whispered back. 

His flashlight tilting in front of him, Brian made his way to the table. He 
peered down at the cereal bowl. “The Phantom—he was just here,” Brian said. 
“The cereal isn’t soggy yet.” 

“This is amazing!” I cried. “Someone actually lives down here, way below 
the—” 

I stopped because I felt a sneeze coming on. Maybe a whole sneezing fit. 

I tried to hold it in. But I couldn’t. I sneezed once. Twice. Five times. 

“Stop it, Brooke!” Brian pleaded. “He’ll hear you!” 

“But we want to find him,” Zeke reminded Brian. 

I sneezed seven times. Then one more for good luck. Finally, I was all 
sneezed out. 

“He heard that. I know he did,” Brian fretted. His eyes darted around in fear. 
The door slammed shut. 

“Nooo!” We all jumped and cried out. 

My heart leaped to my mouth. Every muscle in my body tied itself into a 

knot. 

We turned to stare at the door. Someone had closed it, I knew. It hadn’t been 
blown shut by any wind. 

Zeke was the first to move. Lowering his flashlight, he hurtled to the door. 
He grabbed the knob and pushed hard. 

The door didn’t budge. 

Zeke lowered his shoulder against the door. Twisting the knob, he pushed 
again. 

Still no success. 

He banged his shoulder against the door. Pushed again. Strained against the 
door with all his weight. 

When he turned back to us, his face revealed his fear for the first time. “We 
—we’re locked in,” he said softly. 



21 


I rushed up beside Zeke. “Maybe if all three of us try,” I suggested. 

“Maybe,” Zeke replied. But I could see he didn’t have much hope. 

I swallowed hard. Seeing Zeke so frightened made me even more 
frightened. 

“Yeah. Let’s all push together,” Brian agreed, stepping up beside me. “We 
can break the door down if we have to.” 

Way to go, Brian! I thought. He’s finally showing some spirit. 

We lined up against the door and prepared to push. 

I took another deep breath and held it. I was trying to calm myself down. 
My arms and legs felt as if they were made of chewing gum. 

This is just so scary, I realized. If we are locked in this tiny room and can’t 
get out, we could be here for the rest of our lives. We are miles and miles away 
from the rest of the world. 

Everyone will search and search up above. And they’ll never find us. And 
even if we yell and scream at the tops of our lungs for help, there’s no way 
anyone could hear us. 

We’ll be trapped here forever. 

I took another deep breath. “Okay, on the count of three,” I said. “On three, 
everybody push.” 

Zeke started to count. “One... two...” 

“Whoa! Wait a minute!” I interrupted. I stared at the door. “We pushed the 
door to get in here—right?” 

“Yeah, I guess,” Zeke replied, staring hard at me. 

“So it won’t push open from inside,” I said. “We have to pull it open.” 

“Hey—you’re right!” Zeke cried. 

I grabbed the knob, twisted it, and pulled hard. 

The door slid open easily. 

And there was a man standing in the doorway. 

My flashlight moved up to his face. I recognized him instantly. 

Emile. The little, white-haired man who said he was the night janitor. 

He blocked the doorway and glared in at us, an ugly, menacing scowl on his 



scarred face. 



22 


“Let us go!” I shrieked. 

He didn’t move. His strange, gray eyes moved from Zeke to Brian to me. 

“You have to let us out of here!” I insisted. And then I added meekly, 
“Please?” 

His scowl grew even angrier. The light from the flashlight made the long 
scar on his cheek look even deeper. 

He didn’t budge from the doorway. “Why are you down here?” he 
demanded in his hoarse whisper of a voice. “Why are you in my home?” 

“So—you are the Phantom!” I blurted out. 

He narrowed his eyes at me in surprise. “Phantom?” His expression turned 
thoughtful. “I guess you could call me that.” 

Brian uttered a low cry. 

“This is my home sweet home,” the man said angrily. “Why are you here? 
Why didn’t you listen to my warnings?” 

“Your warnings?” I asked. I was shaking so hard, the light from my 
flashlight was dancing all over the wall. 

“I did everything I could to keep you away,” the Phantom said. “To keep 
you from my home.” 

“You mean the paint on the backdrop? Swinging down from the catwalk? 
The scary mask in my locker with the note?” I cried in astonishment. 

The Phantom nodded. “I tried to warn you. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. 
But I had to protect my home.” 

“And so you tried to stop our play?” Zeke demanded, huddling close to me. 
“You tried to ruin our play so we wouldn’t use the trapdoor and find you down 
here?” 

The Phantom nodded. 

“And what happened seventy-two years ago?” I asked him. “What 
happened to you the first time the play was supposed to be performed? Why did 
you disappear that night?” 

The Phantom’s expression changed. I saw confusion in his silvery eyes. “I 
—I don’t understand,” he stammered, staring hard at me, his white hair falling 
over his forehead. 



“Seventy-two years ago,” I insisted. 

A bitter smile formed on his lips. “Hey, I’m not that old!” he replied. “I’m 
only fifty-seven.” 

“Then... you’re not the Phantom?” Zeke asked uncertainly. 

Emile shook his head. He let out a weary sigh. “I don’t understand this 
Phantom talk, young man. I’m just a poor homeless guy trying to protect my 
little space.” 

All three of us studied him, trying to decide if he was telling the truth. I 
decided that he was. “You’ve been living here under the school?” I asked softly. 
“How did you know about this room down here?” 

“My father worked at the school for thirty years,” Emile replied. “He used 
to bring me here with him when I was a kid. When I lost my apartment in town, I 
remembered this space. I’ve been living here ever since. For nearly six months 
now.” 

His eyes glared angrily again. He brushed the hair off his forehead as his 
ugly scowl returned. “But you’re mining it for me, aren’t you?” he said sharply. 
“You’re ruining it all for me.” 

He moved quickly, stepping from the doorway, entering the room, walking 
toward us with that menacing expression. 

I stumbled back. “Wh-what are you going to do to us?” I cried. 



23 


“You mined everything. Everything,” he repeated, moving toward us. 

“Now, wait—” I cried, raising my hands as if to shield myself. 

Then I heard a sound. From out in the tunnel. A low clanking sound. 

I turned to Zeke and Brian. They heard it, too. 

The trapdoor! It was moving. Coming down. We could hear it at the other 
end of the tunnel. 

I think all three of us had the same idea at once. We had to get to that 
trapdoor. It was our only chance of escape. 

“You ruined everything,” Emile repeated, suddenly sounding more sad than 
angry. “Why didn’t you listen to my warnings?” 

Without saying a word to each other, Zeke, Brian, and I charged for the 
door. “Oh!” I bumped into Emile as I scooted past. 

To my surprise, he didn’t reach out to grab me, didn’t try to stop me. 

I led the way out the door, running at full speed. My legs still felt as rubbery 
as chewing gum. But I forced them to move. One running step, then another. 

I didn’t glance back. But I could hear Zeke and Brian at my heels. And then 
I heard Emile’s voice echoing through the tunnels: “You ruined everything. 
Everything!” 

Was Emile chasing after us? 

I didn’t care. I just wanted to get to that trapdoor platform and get out of 
there! 

I plunged blindly through the dark, curving tunnel. My sneakers sank into 
the soft dirt floor as I ran. My shoulder scraped the rough wall, but I didn’t slow 
down. 

The light bounced over the ground at my feet. I raised it as the trapdoor 
platform came into view. I was gasping for breath. My side ached from running. 

“Huh? What are you doing down here?” a man’s voice called. 

Zeke’s dad! 

Zeke, Brian, and I scrambled on to the platform, squeezing beside him. 

“What’s going on?” Mr. Matthews demanded. “Whose voice is that?” 

“Up!” I managed to choke out. “Take us up.” 



Zeke reached out and flipped the switch. This time it moved. 

With a hard jerk, the platform started to raise itself. 

I gazed back to the tunnel. Had Emile followed after us? 

No. No sign of him. 

He hadn’t even chased us. 

Weird, I thought. So weird. 

“I heard a man’s voice. Who was that?” Mr. Matthews demanded again. 

“A homeless guy. Living beneath the stage,” I said, explaining what 
happened and how he had been trying to scare us for weeks. 

“How did you know we were down there?” Zeke asked his dad. 

“You were supposed to be at home,” he replied sternly. “You were 
grounded. You’re still grounded. But when you weren’t at home, I figured I’d 
find you poking around the stage again. The side door to the school was open. I 
entered the auditorium and heard the trapdoor moving. I decided to see what was 
going on.” 

“I’m so glad!” I cried. I felt like hugging Mr. Matthews. 

As soon as the platform stopped, we scrambled to the stage. Zeke’s dad 
hurried to call the police. He told them there was a homeless guy living under 
the school. 

The police arrived quickly. We watched them go down the trapdoor. We 
waited for them to bring Emile up. But they returned a few minutes later without 
him. 

“No one down there,” an officer reported. He removed his helmet and 
scratched his black, wavy hair. “No sign of anyone, either. Just a bed and some 
old furniture.” 

“What about his food? His books?” I asked. 

“All gone,” the officer replied. “Guess he cleared out real fast. The 
basement door was still slightly open.” 

After the police left, Brian said good night and headed out of the 
auditorium. Zeke’s dad was going to drive me home. 

I turned to Zeke. “So, there’s your Phantom,” I said with a little sadness. 
“Just a poor homeless man. Not a seventy-two-year-old ghost who’s been 
haunting the school since it was built. Just a poor homeless man.” 

“Yeah, it’s disappointing,” Zeke replied, frowning. “I really wanted to meet 
a real ghost, a real phantom.” His expression brightened. “But at least now Ms. 
Walker will believe me. And I’ll get my part in the play back.” 



The play. I’d almost forgotten about the play. 

Zeke was right, I thought happily. He’ll get his part back now. Everything 
will go fine. 

The Phantom is gone. 

Now we can all relax, I thought. Now we can enjoy ourselves and put on a 
great performance. 

Wow. Was I wrong! 



24 


The night of the performance, I sat in the girls’ dressing room, smearing globs of 
stage makeup all over my face. I’d never worn so much makeup before, and 
didn’t think I was doing it right. I didn’t even want to wear the gunk in the first 
place. 

But Ms. Walker said we all had to. Even the guys. She said it cuts down on 
the glare from the lights and makes your face less shiny on stage. 

It was a wild scene in the girls’ dressing room. We were all struggling into 
our costumes and brushing on makeup. Lisa Rego and Gia Bentley—two fifth- 
graders who didn’t even have big parts in the play—were hogging the full-length 
mirror, laughing and giggling and admiring themselves. 

By the time I got to check myself out, the stage manager was calling, 
“Places! Places, everyone!” 

My stomach jumped. Calm down, Brooke, I ordered myself. This is 
supposed to be fun—remember? 

I stepped out of the dressing room, crossed the hall, entered the auditorium 
through the stage door, and took my place at the side of the stage. Someone 
tapped me on the shoulder, and I jumped a mile. Man, was I jittery! 

I whirled around and found myself face-to-face with the Phantom! 

I knew it was only Zeke in his costume and mask, but he startled me just 
the same. “Zeke! You look so real! You look awesome!” I told him. 

Zeke didn’t reply. He gave me a very formal bow from the waist, then 
hurried to take his place. 

The curtain was closed. But I could hear the steady rumble of voices out in 
the auditorium. I peeked out of the side of the curtain. Wow! Every seat was 
filled. That thought sent my stomach doing jumping jacks all over again. 

The lights began to dim. The audience instantly became silent. The stage 
lights went up. The music started. 

Go for it, Brooke, I told myself. Just go for it! 

The play didn’t get strange until the end of the first act. We were all doing really 
well until then. 

When the curtain opened, and the audience applauded the set, I stepped out 



onstage with Corey. And I completely forgot about my stage fright. 

“Be careful, daughter,” Corey warned, playing my father. “There’s a 
creature living beneath this theater. A twisted phantom, scarred and ugly.” 

“I do not believe you, Father,” I replied as Esmerelda. “You are only trying 
to control me, to keep me a child!” 

The audience seemed to be having a great time. They laughed in the right 
places and applauded several times. 

This is excellent! I thought. I was excited without being nervous. I was 
enjoying every minute of the performance. 

And as the first act drew near its end, I knew the real highlight of the show 
was coming. A fog of dry ice swept slowly over the stage. Blue lights swirled 
through the twisting fog, making it appear eerie and unreal. 

I heard the clank of the trapdoor. I knew it was carrying Zeke in his 
Phantom costume up from down below. 

In seconds, the Phantom would make his big entrance, rising up in the blue 

fog. 

The audience will love it, I thought, watching the fog billow up over my 
long, yellow dress. 

“Phantom, is that you?” I called. “Are you coming to see me?” 

The Phantom’s blue-and-green mask floated up in the fog. Then his black- 
caped shoulders hovered into view. 

The audience gasped and then cheered as the Phantom rose, standing stiffly 
in the fog, his black cape billowing out behind him. 

And then he stepped toward me, walking slowly, majestically. 

“Oh, Phantom! We are together at last!” I cried with all the emotion I could 
put into it. “I have dreamed of this moment for so long!” 

I took his gloved hand and led him through the swirls of blue fog to the 
front of the stage. 

A white spotlight captured us both. 

I turned to face him. Stared into his eyes behind the blue-and-green mask. 

And realized instantly that it wasn’t Zeke! 



25 


I started to cry out. But he squeezed my hand. 

His eyes burned into mine. He seemed to be begging me with his eyes, 
begging me not to say anything, not to give him away. 

Who is he? I wondered, frozen in the bright spotlight. Why does he look 
familiar? 

I turned back to the audience. Silent. Waiting for me to speak. 

I took a deep breath and said Esmerelda’s next line. “Phantom, why do you 
haunt this theater? Please tell me your story. I will not be afraid.” 

The Phantom swept his cape behind him. His eyes were still locked on 
mine. His gloved hand still squeezed mine tightly, as if to keep me from 
escaping. 

“I have lived under this theater for more than seventy years,” he declared. 
“My story is a sad one. You might even call it tragic, my fair Esmerelda.” 

“Please continue!” I exclaimed. 

Who is he? I asked myself. Who? 

“I was chosen to star in a play,” the Phantom revealed. “A play in this very 
theater. It was to be the greatest night of my life!” 

He paused to take a long, deep breath. 

My heart skipped a beat. He isn’t reciting the script, I realized. Those aren’t 
the right words. 

What is he saying? 

“But my great night was never to be!” the Phantom continued, still gripping 
my hand. “You see, my dear Esmerelda, an hour before the play was to begin, I 
fell. I plunged to my death!” 

I gasped. He was pointing to the trapdoor. 

I realized who he was now. He was the boy who had disappeared. The boy, 
seventy-two years ago, who was to star as the Phantom. But disappeared and 
was never found. 

Here he was, standing beside me on the same stage. Here he was, revealing 
to us all how he had disappeared, why the play was never performed. 

“There!” he cried, pointing to the opening in the stage floor. “That’s where I 
fell! There! I fell to my death. I became a real phantom. And I’ve waited down 



there ever since, waiting, waiting. Hoping for a night like tonight where I could 
finally play my greatest role!” 

As he finished this speech, the audience burst into cheers and loud 
applause. 

They think it’s part of the play, I realized. They don’t know the true pain 
behind his words. They don’t know that he’s revealing his true story to them. 

The Phantom took a deep bow. The applause grew even louder. 

The fog billowed over us both. 

Who is he ? Who ? 

The question repeated in my mind. 

I had to know the answer. I had to know who the Phantom was. 

As he stood up from his bow, I pulled my hand free of his. 

Then I reached up—and tugged off his mask!

I squinted into the thick, blue fog, desperate to see his face. 

The bright spotlight flashed in my eyes, blinding me for a moment. 

In that moment, the Phantom covered his face with both hands. 

I reached to pull away his hands. 

“No!” he screamed. “No—you can’t!” 

He staggered back, away from me. 

Staggered and lost his balance. 

“No! No!” he cried. “You can’t! You can’t!” 

And toppled backwards. 

Into the open trapdoor. 

And vanished in the swirling blue fog. 

I heard his scream all the way down. 

Then silence. 

A horrible, still silence. 

The audience rose to its feet and burst into loud applause and cries of 
“Bravo!” 

They all thought it was part of the play. 

But I knew better. I knew that the Phantom had finally revealed himself 
after seventy-two years. That he had finally had his moment on the stage. 

And that he had died all over again. 

As the curtain closed, muffling the excited cheers of the audience, I stood at 
the opening in the floor, my hands pressed to my face. 

I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t move. 

I stared down into the hole in the floor and saw only blackness. 

Then, raising my eyes, I saw Zeke running across the stage to me. Wearing 
jeans and a white T-shirt, he lurched toward me, his expression dazed. 

“Zeke!” I cried. 

“Ow. Someone hit me, I think,” he moaned, rubbing the back of his head. 
“I’ve been out cold.” He raised his eyes to mine. “Brooke, are you okay? Did 
_?” 

“The Phantom!” I cried. “He took your part, Zeke. He—he’s down there!” I 



pointed into the opening. “We’ve got to find him!” 

I stepped on the peg. The trapdoor clanked and groaned. The platform 
returned to the top. 

Zeke and I climbed aboard. 

We rode it down, down to the dark chamber below. 

We searched every corner. We didn’t find him. We didn’t find the mask. Or 
the costume. Or anything. Somehow I knew we wouldn’t. Somehow I knew we 
would never see him again. 

“Great job, people! Great job!” Ms. Walker called to us as we trooped offstage. 
“Phantom, I liked the new lines you added! Great job! See you all at the cast 
party!” 

Zeke and I struggled to get to the dressing room so we could get changed. 
But we were mobbed by people who wanted to congratulate us and tell us how 
talented and terrific we were. 

The play was a major success! 

I searched for Brian. I wanted to tell him all about the Phantom. But I 
couldn’t see him in the excited crowd of friends and parents. 

“Come on—let’s get out of here!” Zeke cried. He pulled me by the hand out 
of the auditorium and into the hall. 

“Wow! We’re a hit!” I exclaimed, feeling totally wrecked and pumped and 
dazed and crazed, all at the same time. 

“Let’s just get our coats and get changed at home,” Zeke suggested. “We 
can try to figure out who played my part on the way. Then we can meet at my 
house to go to the party.” 

“Okay,” I agreed. “But we have to hurry. My parents are waiting to tell me 
what a fabulous star lam!” 

The sound of excited chattering and laughter drifted from the auditorium 
and followed us as we made our way to our lockers. 

“Hey—” I stopped in front of my locker. “Look, Zeke—the door is open. I 
didn’t leave it unlocked.” 

“Weird,” Zeke murmured. 

I pulled the door all the way open, and a book toppled out onto the floor. 

I bent to pick it up. It was an old book, its brown cover worn and dusty. I 
turned it around, squinting to read the cover in the dim hall light. 

“It’s a really old yearbook,” I told Zeke. “Look. It’s from this school. 



Woods Mill. But it’s from the 1920s.” 


“Huh? How’d it get in your locker?” Zeke asked, staring down at it. 

My eyes fell on a torn sheet of paper tucked inside. A bookmark. 

Gripping the heavy, old book in both hands, I opened to the pages marked 
by the bookmark. 

“Wow!” Zeke cried. “I don’t believe it!” 

We were staring at a yearbook article about the play we had just performed. 
“The Phantom To Be Performed in the Spring,” read the headline at the top. 

“This must have been written early that school year,” I said. “We know the 
play was never performed. We know the whole story of what happened back 
then.” 

“Hold the book up to the light,” Zeke instructed. “Let’s check out the 
pictures.” 

I raised the book, and we both stared down at the small photographs that 
covered the two pages. 

Then we saw it. 

A small, blurred black-and-white photo of the boy who had won the starring 
role, the boy who was to play the Phantom. The boy who had disappeared. 

The boy was Brian.
