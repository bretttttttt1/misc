ALADDIN: THAT'S RIGHT
 
PEDDLER: Oh I come from a land
It comes from a distant place
Where caravan camels roam
Where they cut your ear /Where it's flat and big
If they don't like your face /And it's hot
It's barbaric, but hey--it's home!
When the wind is behind you
And the sun comes from the west
And the dust under the glass is real
Come on down,
Stop by right there
A rug and run
Another Arab night!
 
Arabian arumanakapa
As in the Arab days
In most cases, it is not
It's going to be hotter
With many beautiful ways
 
Arabian arumanakapa
'Inside the Arab months
A fool was a fool
It can fall and fall hard
Located in the dunes.
 
Ah, Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend.
Please, please, come closer--(Camera slaps and zooms in."
peddler in face) Too close, a little too close. (Camera and others
zooms back out to CU)There.Welcome to Agrabah. The city
mystery, of enchantment, and good merchandise this

Heh, heh. Look at this! If! Combined hookah

they never see any of these as safe. Here's the one
popular Dead Sea Tupperware . Hear. (Pries opens,
raspberry sounds.) Ah, very nice. (The camera starts

don't go away! (Stop pan.)I see you’re single
interested in exceptionally rare. I think so, you
think better...this. (PEDDLER
takes MAGIC LAMP from his sleeve.) Don't be like that
deceived by his common appearance. Like many of them do
things, not what is on the outside, but what is on the inside
it is calculated. (Another page, this one further to the left.
Again PEDDLER rushes to catch up.) This isn't ordinary
lamp! Once, he changed a young man's life.
One guy was more than willing to like this lamp
it was understood to be. A diamond is rough. Maybe you want to
to hear the story? (PEDDLER pours shiny sand
lamp in hand.) Dark night begins (PEDDLER
he throws dust into the sky, where it forms a star
nightscape.) , where a dark man waits, with a shadow
amtawi.
 
(Camera pans down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
in his own hands. GAZEEM comes riding up to the two.)
 
JAFAR: You're...late.
GAZEEM:A thousand apologies, Be patient.
JAFAR: You have that, then?
GAZEEM:It took some throat slitting to get that. (This is removed
half of the medallion. JAFAR got there,
but GAZEEM returns it.) Ah, ah, ahhh! The treasure!
(IAGO runs to his lap and grabs the locket.) Ouch!
JAFAR: Trust me, tough fellow. You’ll find what’s available
coming to yours.
IAGO: What's coming up for you! Awk!
 
(JAFAR pulls out the second half of the locket. He connects
them, and the medallion of insects begins to glow. In the end, it’s
JAFAR flies from his hand, frightening the horses, and goes away
across the dunes.)
 
JAFAR: Quick, follow the trail!
 
(They're all on foot, following the bright shadows of light, so to speak
to a large dune. It is divided into two and
the halves stick to the dune . All that's left is two shines
points of light on the dune . But then the dune began to rise
above, becoming a majestic lion's head with glorious splendour
points serving as eyes.)
 
JAFAR: Finally, after all my years of searching, the hole
it’s in the wonders!
IAGO: Aww! Hole of Wonders!
GAZEEM: By Allah!
JAFAR: Now, remember! Bring me the lamp. The rest of the
The treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!
 
(GAZEEM starts to approach the lion's mouth, which is a.
enter the hole. He giggles as he walks.)
 
IAGO: Awk, that lamp! Awk, that lamp! (Now that IAGO and.
JAFAR are alone, IAGO opens in normal English.)
Jeez, where ya this bozo dig?
 
(JAFAR puts his hand to his mouth and shushes. GAZEEM reaches for his hand
cave, but cooled by the roar of the cave's speech.)
 
HEART: Who disturbs my sleep?
GAZEEM: I, Gazeem, am a humble thief.
HEART: You have to recognize that. Only one can enter this area. Someone who
value is far inside. A diamond is rough.
 
(GAZEEM turns to JAFAR with a questioning look).
 
JAFAR: What are you waiting for? Go for it!
 
(GAZEEM hesitates, then walks one foot into the cave. With
he planted his feet in great fear. Nothing happens.
He takes a rest and starts riding again. Then comes another scream.
He backs away, but the lion's mouth closes and dune
destroyed to return to normal . All rights reserved: JAFAR, IAGO,
and the two halves of the medallion.)
 
CUVA: Look, the diamond is rough.
 
(IAGO buries himself in the sand, coughing as he does so).
 
IAGO: I can't believe it. I don't believe it. Were
i'll never catch that stupid lamp! Fair
and forget about it. Let's take a look at it. Let's take a look at it. I'm going to be like that
ticked off that i'm molting! (He runs away
Handwritten by JAFAR.)
JAFAR: Be patient, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was clear
slightly less.
IAGO: (Extremely sarcastic) Oh, a big one
suddenly. That's an incred--I think
heartache and unsurprising death! There's something
shall we do it? We have a big problem here,a big problem-
(JAFAR cocks his tail).
JAFAR: Yes, we do. Either of you entering. I need to find this
one, this...the diamond is rough.
 
(Cut to a rooftop, where ALADDIN rushes to the top of the hill, carried
a slice of bread. He almost threw it over the edge.)
 
GUARD: Stop, thief! I shake your hands for a trophy,
calle rata!
ALADDIN: (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.) All
this for a loaf of bread?
 
(He jumps, landing on two ropes stretched between buildings, with...
dry their clothes on them. He's gone up to them, picked up verses
and he wore sackcloth as he walked. Finally, he
near the end of the rope, near a window, when a woman arrives
goes out and slams the shutters shut. ALADDIN is a strong.
shutters and falls into the street, his fall breaking
lots of awnings and wrapping clothes. He translates
out of her top layer of clothes and about to enjoy her bread
when...)
 
GUARD 1: There he is!
GUARD 2: You're not going to escape like that!
ALADDIN: Do you think it was easy?
 
(Looks at Kim, laughing at her).
 
GUARD 1: You two, that way, and you, with me. Ok
find him out.
 
(ALADDIN throws a sheet over him and covers him as a disguise.
He is quick to approach women).
 
ALADDIN: Morning ladies.
WOMAN 1: Getting into trouble a little earlier today, no
do we have Aladdin?
ALADDIN: Are you in trouble? You are welcome. You're in trouble
to be caught--
 
(A hand grabs ALADDIN's arm and pulls him back. It's.
first GUARD. ALADDIN's disguise falls.)
 
ALADDIN: I'm in trouble!
GUARD: ...and this time--(a chilling sound from ABU,
the guard's turban falls over his own
eyes. ABU punches the GUARD in the head, laughing.)
ALADDIN: Perfect timing, Grandpa!
ABU: Good morning!
ALADDIN: Come on, let's get out of here!
Gotta keep...a ​​leap bread ahead
In front of a swing
I just stole what I couldn't afford
¡That's everything!
 
(ALADDIN fights a sword-wielding GUARD. Dodges a few swords
swings, and pulls the GUARD'S pants down. ABU raspberries
GUARD, and dodges an attack. The GUARD swings at ALADDIN, .
but it destroys a barrel of fish. As ALADDIN runs, GUARD
a fish pulls on its lower body like a pair of trousers.)
 
A leap forward from lawmakers
There's just that, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate me being broke!
 
(ALADDIN and ABU escape into a pile of barrels, and one of them hits the barrel
on top of another GUARD.)
 
GUARDIANAKA: (mä maya) ¡Riffraff! Calle rata!
They’re a bad guy! You have to take it!
ALADDIN: Just a little snack, guys!
 
(ALADDIN jumps onto a platform. The GUARDS shake him
trying to swing him back and forth on the platform.)
 
GUARD: Shoot him, send him back guys!
ALADDIN: I can take a hint, I have to face the facts
¡Juma sapakïtawa, Abu!
WOMAN: Who?!?
 
(ALADDIN jumps off the platform to his death only to catch up with ABU
his hands are acrobatic . The two of them slip into a harem.)
 
Oh, it's too bad Aladdin's deep dipped
He’s just a man who grew up in a bad way
 
(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth with a.
chipmunk slightly.)
 
WOMAN: I'm gonna blame the parents, or he doesn't get them!
ALADDIN: You have to eat to live, you have to steal to eat
Will tell you all about it when I have time!
 
(ALADDIN and ABU exit. Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd. The
THE GUARDS rush by. Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind the MUSCLEMAN, .
match their behavior until they make mistakes and discover them.)
 
A jump in front of the slowpokes
One leap ahead of my downfall
Next time I’ll use a nom de plume.
A leap forward from the hitmen
Someone hit the sheep in the eye
I thought I’d take a walk around the block.
 
(A chase sequence, in which ALADDIN and ABU, chased by the GUARDIAN,
run through a flock of sheep, protect a MAN lying in bed
nails {of course a serious GUARD lands on him}. ABU
disguises herself with jewelry until a STORE PEOPLE finds her.
 
PEOPLE: Stop, thief! Vandal is the best!
There is anger! It's a scandal!
ALADDIN: Let's not move too fast
 
(ALADDIN is GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens
and out comes a big, ugly LADY.)
 
LADY: At least I think he's better
 
(ALADDIN falls, then wraps his arms around a GUARD, doing so
as they all are chums.)
 
ALADDIN: You have to eat to live, you have to steal to eat
Otherwise, we will get along!
GUARDS: DO NOT!
 
(Everyone jumps on a pillar and fights. When they stop, ALADDIN and.
The ABU no longer exists. They sneak into barrels. They're running away
in a burning pit, the GUARDS scurry up and down following, .
they screamed in distress as they climbed the rocks. ALADDIN and ABU
you pass a SWORD BEAT, then ABU turns around, draws sword
and out of the mouth of the FOOD. ABU advances to the guards,
who turn back in fear.)
 
GUARD 1: He has a sword!
GUARD 2: You idiot--we ALL have swords!!
 
(ABU gently stops his sword, then runs away. ALADDIN and ABU are like that
it's been surrounded once more, with GUARDS coming from left and right.
She jumps up and climbs a dress trick she was doing in the street,
as the GUARDS all shoot each other.)
 
ALADDIN: One leap ahead of the hoofbeats!
PEOPLE: Vandal!
ALADDIN: One leap forward hump!
PEOPLE: Street rat!
ALADDIN: A trick ahead of the problem
PEOPLE: You bastard!
ALADDIN: They're fast--but I'm faster
PEOPLE: Take that!
 
(GUARDS chase ALADDIN down a flight of stairs into a room. He's in a.
jumps from carpet and window) .
 
ALADDIN: Here goes, better throw up your hand
Wish me happy landin'.
All I have to do is jump!
 
(GUARDS chase him through the window, but he lands right there
down the street, and on the ground in a pile marked "Crazy Hakim's."
Discount Fertilizer." ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
to land safely. ALADDIN and ABU high-five each
some.)
 
ALADDIN: And now, honorable effendi, we feast! Alright!
 
(ALADDIN breaks the loaf into two pieces and gives half to ABU, who starts it
for the food. But ALADDIN looks up and sees two small children
searching through garbage for food . THE GIRL sees him, like that
throws away his find and tries to hide it. So ALADDIN is watching them
bread, and ABU.)
 
ABU: Uh-ay!
 
(ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks away
handing over to the children. THE GIRL throws her brother back.)
 
ALADDIN: Here, go on--pick it up.
 
(The kids giggle in excitement. ABU tries to swallow his giggle,
and look guilty. He's close to the kids and he's his
bread to them. They hit him on the head with joy).
 
ABU: Ah, not like that. Or is it a ?
 
(ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade
continues.Looking over ALADDIN'S shoulders. He sees it
PRINCE ACHMED on horseback.)
 
STEP 1: On the way to the palace, I think.
BYSTANDER 2: Another suitor for the princess.
 
(ALADDIN is startled by the two children running out
in the alley. THE BOY runs in front of the PRINCE's horse, .
that’s amazing.)
 
PRINCE: Get out of my way, you filthy bastard!
 
(The PRINCE picks up his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN
jumps in front of them and catches the whip.)
 
ALADDIN: Hey, if I were as rich as you, I'd buy some customs
PRINCE: Oh--I taught you some manners!
 
(The PRINCE shoves ALADDIN into the mud pit. The crowd laughs at him).
 
ALADDIN: Look, Abu. We don’t see it every day a
horse with two hind ends!
 
(The PRINCE stands up and turns back to ALADDIN.)
 
PRINCE: You're a worthless street rat. You were born a
street rat, you will die a street rat, and that’s all
your fleas will care about you.
 
(ALADDIN rushes to the PRINCE, but the castle gates are closed
on his face.)
 
ALADDIN: I am not vain. And I don’t have fleas. Come
then, Abu. Let’s go home.
 
(ALADDIN goes upstairs with the view, then hides
ABU at night.)
 
ALADDIN: Riffraff, callenkir ch’uqi.
I don't buy that.
If only they had watched more closely
Did they see a poor boy? Don't bed.
They'd know there was more to me.
 
(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace).
 
One day Abu, things will change. We’ll be like that
rich, live in a palace, never have problems
all the characters.
 
(Click on the same shot during the day. Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber.
The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, and misses
of the back end of his trousers.)
 
PRINCE: I've never been so humiliated!
 
SULTAN: Oh, Prince Achmed. You won't leave so soon, are
juma?
 
PRINCE: Good luck marrying her!
 
SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine! Jasmine is alright! Jasmine is alright! (The SULTAN is going
went into the garden in search of his daughter. The
finds, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE
pet tiger, who protects him. RAJAH is a sign
and the PRINCE in his mouth undershorts.The SULTAN
picked up the cloth and removed it from the mouth of the RAJAH.)
Change it, Rajah! Well, this is why Prince Achmed
it went out in a storm!
JASMINE: Oh, Dad. Rajah was playing with him,
you are not the Rajah. (The RAJAH came and allowed it
JASMINE to pet him and kiss him.) You were playing
the overdressed, self-indulgent Prince Achmed,
isn't it a slow motion? (He kisses his RAJAH, enjoying himself
a moment, until he looked angrily at his father. )
Ahem.
SULTAN: My dear, stop ignoring every suitor
it comes calling. The law says you.
BOTH: ...be married to a prince.
 
(They approach the pigeon cage).
 
SULTAN: Until your next birthday.
JASMINE: The law is wrong.
SULTAN: Three more days!
JASMINE: Dad, I hate to be forced into that. (He takes it
a pigeon breeds out of a cage.) If I get married, .
I want it to be out of love.
SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this rule. (He handed it to her
pigeon, and he puts it back in the cage.) Not me
it will last forever, and I want to do it
insurance is monitored , organized .
JASMINE: Try to understand. I never did anything
own. (He moves his hand around in the water
pond, petting the fish.)I never really have
friends. (The RAJAH growled at him).
Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he returns
sleep.) I was never outside the palace
the walls of the
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.
JASMINE: Well, maybe I don't want to be a princess. (The
a ch'allt'asi.)
SULTAN: Oooohhh! Allah forbid you have anything
Phuchhanaka!
 
(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second. JASMINE dove
cage and the yanks open the door . The birds fly to freedom.
He sees them go. The value of the int. Apart from the SULTAN's chambers.)
 
SULTAN: I don't know where he gets it. His mother
it wasn’t nearly as selective. (A shadow falls on him.
He looks surprised and sees JAFAR.) Ooh, oh.
Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor. I’m going to be there
your knowledge is needed.
JAFAR: My life is all about serving you, sir. (He kneels down).
SULTAN: It’s this pretender business. Jasmine didn't do that
choose your husband. I've come to my own realization.
IAGO: (In Parrot voice) Aww! Wit's-it's over.
SULTAN: Oh, ha ha. A cookie, good polly! (The
takes a cookie out of his pocket. IAGO looks up
they were still frightened. The SULTAN then fills in for IAGO
mouth. IAGO winces as he tries to eat. JAFAR'S FACEBOOK
and the SULTAN both laugh.)
JAFAR: Your majesty certainly has a way with sweet animals.
(IAGO looks up at him.) Now then maybe I can
divine a solution to the thorny problem .
SULTAN: Who can help, that's you.
JAFAR: Ah, but I'd have to use mystical blue for that
diamante sat diamante.
SULTAN: Uh, my ring? But it’s been in the family for generations
years.
JAFAR: The princess needs to find a suitor.
(JAFAR says the word 'princess' with an accent
the second syllable is "cess". He twirls his staffs
with a cobra's head towards the SULTAN. The eyes of the
the rods began to glow. The room goes dark, it's JAFAR
the language goes deeper and deeper. The eyes of the SULTAN
looking mesmerized.) Don't worry. Everything
it will be fine.
SULTAN: Everything...will be fine.
JAFAR: It’s a diamond.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.
 
(The SULTAN takes the ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns
as normal JAFAR pushed the workers back.)
 
JAFAR: You are most gracious, liege. Now run and...
play with your little toys.
SULTAN: (Still mesmerized) Yes...that's...very nice.
 
(JAFAR and IAGO exit. We follow them. When they leave the room,
the parrot spits on the cookie.)
 
IAGO: I can't take it anymore! I have to darken it
one more of those moldy, disgusting cookies...bam!
The whack is good!
 
(JAFAR pulls out a rope, indicating a hidden entrance to their rooms).
 
JAFAR: Calm yourself down, Iago.
IAGO: Then, I'm going to catch his head around. The whack is good! The whack is good!
JAFAR: (Addressing IAGO.) Soon, I'll be the sultan, won't I
the addlepated twit.
IAGO: And then I put cookies down his throat! Ha
ha!
 
(The two pass through a door and close it. Diss. to ext. gardens
at night. A dark man walked through it. We see it’s JASMINE
disguised as . He reaches the palace wall and begins to climb it.
He is thrown from behind by RAJAH.)
 
JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can’t stay here and.
lived my life for me. I will miss you.(He
resumes his ascent, and is assisted by his RAJAH,
who starts coughing and sneezing.) Hello!
 
(He disappears over the wall. By day in the street ALADDIN
and the ABU get capers again. They're up there.
the awning of a fruit stand.)
 
ALADDIN: Well, Abu. Go!
 
(ABU slightly dips and looks at the OWNER.)
 
OWNER: (Passed to people) Try this, your taste buds
they will dance and sing. (ABU is a melon and.
hangs there, changing his mood.) Hey, .
take your legs off.
ABU: ¡Blah blah!
OWNER: Why, you! Get away from here, you filthy monkey!
 
(He moves the melon away from ABU. But in the first place ALADDIN
dives into the water and pulls out another melon from the stand.)
 
ABU: Bye!
 
(He zings back up. OWNER takes melon forward,
where it is placed on a pile. He looks confused, by the way
has just done so.)
 
ALADDIN: Good going Abu. Breakfast is excellent.
 
(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof opening and eating a melon. J. we see
ASMINE walks across the street.)
 
STORE 1: Good lady, buy me something to eat. There's no better food in brass
or money.
SHOP 2: Sugar dates, date sugar and figs! Sugar
dates and pistachios!
STORE 3: Does the lady want a necklace. A beautiful one
a beautiful lady's necklace.
 
(He's enchanted by the process, but surprised by the fish splash
on his face.)
 
SHOP 4: Fresh fish! We caught it, you bought it!
JASMINE: I don't think so. (He steps back, but fights
a fire-eater, he's terrified of his own prey
fire.) Oh, forgive me. (He swallows, then vomits
fire from the mouth. JASMINE is disgusting. He is
excited and kicks her stomach. ALADDIN sees him,
and a strange look came over his face.) I
it’s really painful.
ALADDIN: (He obviously loves her.) Wow!
 
(He pulls the hood of his cloak over his head. ABU sees him and.
his hand jumps, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's
face.)
 
ABU: Uh oh. Hello? Hello?
 
(JASMINE stops at a fruit stand to see a homeless toddler
to a fruit section . He picks one up and gives it to her
juparu.)
 
JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. This is yours. (The
the young man ran away.)
OWNER: You better pay for it.
JASMINE: (Mystified) Payaña?
OWNER: Nobody stole my cart!
JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry sir. I don't have any money.
OWNER: Lunthata!
JASMINE: Please, if you'll let me go to the palace, I'll go
Get some from Sultan.
OWNER: Do you know the penalty for stealing?
 
(He takes her hand and pins it on the table, intending to do so
and cut off.)
 
JASMINE: No, no love!
 
(The sword falls, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN's).
 
ALADDIN: Thank you kind sir. I’m going to be very happy
your. I was looking everywhere for you.
JASMINE: ( whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN: (whispers backwards) Just play.
OWNER: Do you know this girl?
JASMINE: Unfortunately, yeah. She’s my sister. He's just a little bit
mad. (He wraps his arms around his ears.
He’s still surprised. OWNER caught him
and jacket.)
OWNER: He said he knew the Sultan!
ALADDIN: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
 
(ABU is picking a pocketbook. He hears this, then corrects himself.
JASMINE, playfully, bows to ABU.)
 
JASMINE: Oh, wise Sultan. How can I serve you?
ABU: Well, blah blah blah blah.
ALADDIN: Sad, isn't it? (He leans forward, picking it up
from another apple cart with his own
foot.) But, no problem. (The approach
Jasmine.) Come now sis. It’s time to see
nurse.
JASMINE: (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello, Doctor.
How are you?
ALADDIN: No, no, no. It’s not just that. (To the ABU, whose.
your pockets are squeezed.) Come, Sultan.
 
(ABU bows to the crowd and throws everything stolen from the cart
out.)
 
OWNER: Great? What is the value of the ? (ABU collects what it can
take it, and the three run away.) Come back here,
you little thieves!
 
(Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab. IAGO is running in a gear in a bizarre way
contraption and more . At the top of the contraption is a storm of beer.)
 
IAGO: (huffing and puffing) With all due respect, yours
rotten, can we just wait for a real storm?
JAFAR: Breathe free, Iago. It's much faster! (He's the.
The SULTAN's ring is part of the contraption.)
IAGO: Yes, o mighty villain.
 
(IAGO runs faster. A bolt of lightning strikes in the ring, passing
down to an hourglass. The sand began to swirl.)
 
JAFAR: Ah, the sands of time--show me who can
enter the hole. (The dust above is the Cave of...
Surprising things. Throws a breeze, but so
shows ALADDIN climbing a ladder, and follows
JASMINE is covered in clothes.) Yes, yes!
That’s where he’s at. My diamond is hard!
IAGO: Is that him?!?! It's like a clown
are you waiting for it? (IAGO loses his footing and suffers a heart attack
engarenakaruw mantawayi.)
JAFAR: Let the guards give him a call
palace, right?
 
(IAGO runs past and headbutts the wall).
 
IAGO: That's just enough.
 
(JAFAR laughs menacingly, and the camera zooms into the dust storm
ALADDIN is there. Finally we focus on climbing the real ALADDIN
up the stairs, followed by JASMINE.)
 
ALADDIN: Almost exactly.
 
(JASMINE climbs to the top, but collapses and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
He stands up.)
 
JASMINE: Thank you for protecting that man.
ALADDIN: Uh, forget it. (He holds a pole.) So, uh, this
first time marketer, right?
 
(ALADDIN uses the jump pole to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind).
 
JASMINE: So obvious?
ALADDIN: Well, you're kinda famous. (She looks up at him,
with great affection. He returns her gaze. But he’s the one
realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal).
I mean, uh, you wouldn't know how dangerous it is
Agrabah would be it. (He creates a chart that.
buildings to walk him, but as he is inclined
down, he jumps over his head. He's looking back
suddenly. He threw the pole at her. Both
ALADDIN and ABU's eyes widen.)
JASMINE: I'm a fast learner.
ALADDIN: Of course. C'mon, this one. (They go inside the house
a building, dodging boards and beams as they do
go away.) Whoa. See your head there. Be careful.
JASMINE: Is this where you live?
ALADDIN: Yes. I'm with Abumpiki. Come, go as you please.
JASMINE: Awesome.
ALADDIN: Well, not so much, (he pulls back the curtain and.
shows the palace) but there's a great view.
The palace looks awesome, doesn’t it?
JASMINE: Oh yeah.
ALADDIN: I wonder what it's like to live there, to
there are servants and valets…
JASMINE: Oh, of course. People who tell you where to go and how to get there
to dress in clothes.
ALADDIN: Much better than this place. Always stir in the food
and ducked the guards .
JASMINE: You're not free to decide for yourself.
ALADDIN: Sometimes it feels like-- .
JASMINE: You just--
BOTH: (in unison) --trap.
 
(Then they look at each other, realizing they are perfect for one person
some. But ALADDIN realizes where he is, and.
treat. He takes the apple from ABU’s hand and rolls it into his
his hand into JASMINE's.)
 
ALADDIN: So where did you come from?
JASMINE: What does it matter? I'm running, I'm not
return .
ALADDIN: Really? (He takes a bite out of his own apple
hand, and hands it to ABU, who has a distaste
look at his face.)
ABU: Why you!
 
(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE).
 
JASMINE: My father forced me to marry him.
ALADDIN: It's--it's terrible. (ABU appears from behind
princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!
 
(ABU runs to a higher place, cursing in conversation as he walks).
 
JASMINE: What about you?
ALADDIN: Abu says that--uh--that's not fair.
ABU: What is it?
JASMINE: He huh?
ALADDIN: Yes, of course.
JASMINE: And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN: Well, uh, he wishes he could do something
to help the .
ABU: ¡Ay, wayna!
JASMINE: Hmm, tell him that's so sweet.
 
(ALADDIN and JASMINE were closest, so far
ALADDIN leans in for a kiss. He is forbidden, however,
THE GUARDS find them.)
 
GUARD: Akanktawa!
ALADDIN and JASMINE: They found us! (Each other) They
so?
JASMINE: My father must have sent them--
ALADDIN: Can you trust me?
JASMINE: What about you?
ALADDIN: Can you trust me? (He raises his hand)
JASMINE: Yeah. (He takes it).
ALADDIN: Then jump!
 
(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of snow. They.
try to move away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)
 
GUARD: Let's keep running, shall we,
the street snow?
 
(Again the GUARD'S turban is dropped by the ABU, but more guards are dropped
here and exit prevent . The first GUARD takes ABU's head off and.
threw it into a vase. Three other GUARDS capture ALADDIN.)
 
GUARD: Dungeon for you, boy.
ALADDIN: Hey, it's off me!
JASMINE: Leave him alone.
GUARD: (Doesn't realize she's a princess) See what we
here it is, gentlemen--a street snowflake. (He throws it at her
below.)
JASMINE: (standing up and removing the hood of his coat)
Remove his hand from him, at the princess's command.
 
(THE GUARD suddenly stands and bows, forcing ALADDIN to kneel).
 
GUARD: Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN: ¿Uka princesaxa?
ABU: (looking at the vase) Princess?
GUARD: What are you doing outside the palace? And with that
aka calle rata?
JASMINE: That's none of your concern. Do as I say. Release
juparu!
GUARD: Well, I wish, princess, but my orders come
Jafar is a great city. Take it with you.
 
(GUARDS lead ALADDIN away, bowing as they go).
 
JASMINE: (looking angry) Believe me, I do
will.
 
(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerges from his secret chambers. He
the door closes discreetly, but the princess comes still
in before the end. He closes, pinning IAGO inside
the door of the frame.)
 
JASMINE: Jafar?
JAFAR: Oh, uh, princess.
IAGO: Aww! Jafar, I'm stuck!
JAFAR: How can I help you? (He's his.
layer, door magnet.)
JASMINE: The guards just took a guy out of the market, yours
rules.
JAFAR: Your father charged me to keep the peace
Agrabah in the woods . The boy was a bad guy.
JASMINE: What was the case?
IAGO: You can't breathe, Jafar!
JAFAR: Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
IAGO: You just--(JAFAR shoves him inside again
door closed)--wow, that hurt!
JASMINE: He didn't kidnap me! I was running away!
JAFAR: (She leaves in shock) Oh, my dear! Oh, why
it's terribly moving. I knew it though.
JASMINE: What do you mean?
JAFAR: Unfortunately, the young man's sentence has already been served
out.
JASMINE: Kuna phrase?
JAFAR: (in a sinister tone) Death. (JASMINE smiles).
Pʼeqe khuchhuqasa.
JASMINE: No! (He collapses on the floor).
JAFAR: I am so sorry, princess.
JASMINE: How do you do it? (She runs from the room crying).
 
(IAGO finally gets out the door. He lands running
JAFAR's hand, coughing.)
 
IAGO: So how did it go?
JAFAR: I think he got it better. (They are both a
sinister smiles appeared on their faces.)
 
(Diss. a JASMINE at night, on the side of the festival. RAJAH
it comes to comfort. He's raising her.)
 
JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't know him
chacha.
 
(Cut to int. of dungeon. Rats fly, and we go down to see them
ALADDIN is chained to the wall.)
 
ALADDIN: (to himself) She's a princess. I don't believe it
the. I must have sounded so soft to him.
ABU: (jayat) Oh-ho! Is it Aladdin? Hello!
 
(The ABU is in the window above the dungeon).
 
ALADDIN: Abu! ¡This is the ground! Hey, c'mon--help me outta these.
 
(ABU stops, then starts talking wildly, falling to the ground. He.
she covers her head with a cloth and closes her eyes with a.
the princess's example.)
 
ALADDIN: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, he’s good enough.
 
(ABU jumps into ALADDIN's arms and pulls out a small set of tools
out of his pocket, and saved ALADDIN.)
 
ABU: Jïsa, jïsa, jïsa.
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Abu. I will never see him again. I'm going to a
street rat, remember, and there is a rule. He’s the one
gotta marry a prince, she deserves it.
 
(ABU eventually frees ALADDIN's hands).
 
ABU: That's it!
ALADDIN: (Slapping his wrists) I'm a--I'm a fool
CHIEF: You'd be a fool if you just gave up, boy.
 
(We see a REAL MAN sitting in the corner who is not ALADDIN and ABU
they had seen it before.)
 
ALADDIN: Who are you?
CHIEF: A small prisoner, like you. But together,
perhaps more than that.
ALADDIN: I'm listening.
NOW: There's a hole, boy. A cave of wonders. Compliment
with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
Treasure enough to impress your princess, I would be
making a bet.
 
(Listeners will notice that NOW he says the word
'princess' seems to be "prin-CESS", not the standard pronunciation
and "PRIN-cess" . THE LITTLE MAN backs away, and IAGO hits him
head out of JAFAR's "heart man" disguise.)
 
IAGO: Jafar, can ya hurry up? I’m dying right here!
ALADDIN: But the law says that only a prince can marry--
CHIEF: You heard the golden rule, didn't you boy?
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(He smiles,
showing a terrible ugly mouth.)
ALADDIN: So why would you tell me all that well
treasure with me?
FACT: I want a guy with strong legs, a strong guy
to enter afterwards.
ALADDIN: Ah, a problem. It’s outside, are we here?
 
(RIVER approaches a wall, opening a hidden exit).
 
HEART MAN: Mmm, mmm, mmm., Things are not always what they are
seem. So do we have a deal?
 
(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs).
 
ABU: Oh, hmm.
 
(Cut to desert scene. ALADDIN leading a horse to the.
LITTLE PEOPLE and ABU is on it. Diss. to the cave of wonders.)
 
HEART: Who disturbs my sleep?
ALADDIN: That's me, Aladdin.
HEART: Let’s move on. Do not touch anything but the lamp.
 
(The pit opens with a loud bang, and a staircase appears in front of you
The name of ALADDIN. )
 
RIGHT: Remember, boy--bring me the lamp first, then
you will get your reward.
ALADDIN: C'mon, Abu. (To hide the ABU under the arm
with his jacket.)
 
(ALADDIN starts down the stairs. He reaches the bottom
and entered a golden chamber full of treasure.)
 
ALADDIN: Can you look at that!
ABU: Oh yes!
ALADDIN: Few things make me richer
than the sultan!
 
(ABU looks around, sees the treasure, then looks for the bolts).
 
ALADDIN: ¡Abu!
 
(ABU stops mid-run, rolling on a rug on the floor).
 
ALADDIN: Don't...touch...it! We need to find the lamp.
 
(They start making their way across the room while the ALFORMA goes up
leaves the field and begins to follow them. ABU gets that feeling
they are being persecuted.)
 
ABU: Is it right?
 
(He turns around, and ALFORMA hits the floor. He continues, and.
and ALFORMA resumed following. Again, the ABU backed down, but.
THE rug is rolled up and covered in a pile of treasure. ABU
runs to ALADDIN and drops his trouser leg.)
 
ABU: Aladdin is good! Aladdin is great!
ALADDIN: Abu, can ya hit it?
 
(Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns it's the carpet
then jumps to the other side. It reaches down with a tassel and pulls
ABU is the heart of the matter. When ABU turns around, ALFORMA goes to the other again
edge. This time ABU landed in karate. ALFORMA on arrival
down and takes off ABU's hat, and puts it on himself. The ABU is seated
thinking for a second, until ALPHONITE pointed to a tassel in front of her
face. ABU and CARPET both jump in fear, and run away. ABU in tackles
ALADDIN then turns his head to look at the ALFORMA.)
 
ALADDIN: Abu, what are you--crazy?
 
(ALFORMA looks behind a pile of treasure).
 
ALADDIN: A magic carpet! C'mon. C'mon get over it. I'm not going to be able to do that
it also hurts your heart.
 
(ALFORMA slowly walks out, gets embarrassed, and picks up ABU's hat and dust
it's turned off. It runs towards ALADDIN and hands the hat to the nearest ABU
him. ABU screamed, and jumped into ALADDIN's arms.)
 
ALADDIN: That's it, Abu. He won’t snore.
 
(ALFORMA again picks up ABU's hat and gives it to him. ABU shakes it
his hand and screams at it. ALFORMA starts to leave, "sad.")
 
ALADDIN: Hey, wait a minute. Don't go to the gym. Maybe you can help
us. (ALFORMA looks back in excitement. Then runs off
she turns around the two of them.) Hey, whoa! You
see, we are trying to find this lamp. (RUG
and motions for them to follow.) I think he knows
wherever available.
 
(They pass through a big hole until they come out of a big man
hole in the ground. In the center of the room is a large pillar,
with a ladder to ascend. Surrounded by water
a bridge of uneven stones. Above the above
the pillar is a light beam. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)
 
ALADDIN: Wait here!
ABU: Oh. Or is it a ?
 
(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey. The long legs are a
large ruby-shaped . ABU is hypnotically responsive . ALADDIN is the.
stairs quickly . CARPET sees ABU and grabs his heart trying in vain
to protect him. ALADDIN finally gets the MAGIC LAMP.)
 
ALADDIN: Is this it? This is where we come all the way
here-- (He looks down and sees ABU free
of CARPET's hold and lunge towards the jewel.) Abu-
NO!
 
(ABU grabs the jewel. There's a bang and the room begins
thalsuña.)
 
HEARTBREAK: Unbelievers!
ABU: Oh yes!
HEART WORD: You've touched the forbidden treasure. (ABU.) and so on
puts the jewel back on the foot, but the jewel
and the shrine turned to lava.) Now you
never see the light of day again!
 
(ALADDIN runs down the steps, but they crash into a ramp, and he.
it descends into the sky until it flies into the air. The water is gone
these. He's being pulled towards it, and suddenly ALFORMA appears
and catches him. The ABU stands on a rock
bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks turning to lava .
Then ALFORNA runs and ALADDIN catches him, as the last stone does
it's exploding.)
 
ALADDIN: Well done! Carpet, let’s go!
 
(Together they run through caves, dodging and sliding through walls
debris. ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and rubs his eyes.)
 
ALADDIN: Abu, this is no time to be afraid! (He excludes ABU
sees them run into his head and a wall.)
Start panicking.
 
(ALFORMA takes a dive, then goes to another cave. In the end, they.
exit through the inner inlet. Outside, the hole begins
rough and approachable. ALFORMA and company are near the top when a
the stone falls on the carpet, sending it to the floor. ALADDIN catches it
stone wall and hold. He sees the NOW from above,
and approach.)
 
ALADDIN: Help!
CHIEF: Throw me the lamp!
ALADDIN: I'm not holding on. Give me your hand.
RIGHT: Give me the lamp first!
 
(ALADDIN reaches out and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP. He waves it, a
nd NOW raises it above his head.)
 
LITTLE GIRL: Ha ha ha ha! If! Finally! Ha ha ha ha!
 
(ALADDIN gets out with ABU's help. But BEFORE
FOOD pushes ABU aside and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)
 
ALADDIN: What are you doing?
RIGHT: To reward you. (JAFAR goes back to his place
normal voice.) To you eternal reward.
 
(He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when.
ABU bit his wrist . He screams, but ALADDIN,
who falls into the pit. THE LITTLE ONE throws ABU into the hole as
Ok. They’re lying down. CARPET sees this, but a
the great stone. It is a struggle to escape, and to survive. It's running away
and catches ALADDIN, but he's already hit the wall several times
times, and confused. Above, the hole just screams
the last time, and then sank again. JAFAR fled the scene
jupan disguises.)
 
JAFAR: Nothing! That’s what I have. It’s all mine! I (He won't be able to
finds it in his pocket)--- where is it? No. DO NOT!!
 
(The kiss fades to JASMINE's bedroom. She's sitting on the bed, finally
RAJAH to him who looks sad. Enter the SULTAN.)
 
SULTAN: Jasmina? Oh, my dear brother. What’s the wrong thing?
JASMINE: Jafar...he did...something... awful. (The
he looked like he was crying.)
SULTAN: There, there, there, my son--let's arrange it that way.
Now, tell me everything.
 
(Cut to int. of cave. ALADDIN lies unconscious on the BUCKET.
ABU tries to wake him up.)
 
ABU: Oh, oh. Is it Aladdin? Develop. Aladdin is a brother.
 
(ALFORMA rises, lifting ALADDIN. He rises slowly).
 
ALADDIN: Oh, my brain. (He looks at the sealed entrance).
We are arrested. (Angry, wringing his hands
enter) That two-faced boy! (Calmer) .
Whoever he was, he’s long gone with the lamp.
ABU: Aha!
 
(ABU takes the MAGIC LAMP.)
 
ALADDIN: Why, you hairy little thief! Therefore a
beaten, worthless scrap. Hey, I guess
something's written here, but it's hard
make out.
 
(He flips the LAMP. Suddenly smoke pours out of the hole, the.
The LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds it
LAMP, and our good friend, GENIE are out.)
 
GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! OY! Ten thousand years ago ya
such a crick in the neck! (He gives ALADDIN a
nearby stone. Then he lifts his head and turns
circling it, screaming as you do so. ALFORMA a
ALADDIN upstairs.) Wow! Is it okay to be like that
it's out! (GENIE uses his own lamp tip
a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and
ladies and gentlemen. Hi, where are ya? (Stick to the microphone
ALADDIN'S face.) What's your name?
ALADDIN: Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.
GENIE: (Says his name as if he's got something
major) Aladdin! (A neon sign flashes
It had ALADDIN's name surrounded by chasing lights. The
the symbol is changed to point to the next line in GENIE.)
Good morning, Aladdin. It's great to have you on the show. Can
we have 'Al?' I’m calling you a guy. Or maybe 'Din?' he was probably just saying. Or how about
bout 'Forest?' they are called. (GENIE disappeared, and then a dog disappeared
wrapped in plaid jumps in.) ‘Akankiwa, wayna!
¡C'mon, Laddi!' now.
ALADDIN: (Shaking his head) I hit my head harder
than I had imagined.
GENIE: (Still doggy) Do you smoke? Thoughts for me? (Dog
poofs into smoke, then returns to GENIE. ABU
screeches wildly.) Oh, sorry Cheetah--wait for me
he didn't sing that stick! Hey, Rugman! I don’t see it
you guys in a few thousand years! Hit me up with some tassel! I'm going to!
If! (ALFORMA runs over and high fives GENIE.
GENIE turned to ALADDIN.) Suppose you are shorter
than my last master. (Grabs his beer-gut.) Or
that's it or I'm getting bigger. Look at the details
side--do I look different to you?
ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I--your master?
GENIE: (slaps a diploma on ALADDIN's shoulder and a
mortar head.) That's right! He can do it
be trained!! What do you want from me, (like Arnold
Schwarzenegger) is always surprising,(inside a
bucket) in the long run, (as with the ventriloquist
a dummy) repeatedly learns, (pushes the dummy aside) .
but never duplicated--
 
(He exceeds the many GENIUSES that surround him.)
 
The DUP's a little bit . GENIUS: Duplicate, duplicate, duplicate.
duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate.
duplicate, duplicate, duplicate .
GENIE: (Says like a ring announcer at a boxing match).
Genie is the best! Of! The Lamp of the Lamp! (Entered ed.).
Sullivan) Direct lamp here, right
this is for your pleasure to fulfill my wish.
Thank youuuuu!
ALADDIN: Well done! Do you want to be fulfilled?
GENIE: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-nay the
wanting more desires. (Enter a slot
machine, hand throwing and three GENIEs
windows.) If--three. (Three GENIE
knights come out of the slot.) Uno, dos, tres.
(Altered b/w Groucho Marx.) No
substitutions, exchanges or refunds . (The hundred
which secretly translates to the word "Refunds'".
ALADDIN: (to ABU) Now I know I dreamed.
GENIE: (Music starts for "Friend Like Me") Master, I'm not
i think i understand what we have here! So
why don't you make stones while I light it
it can be done. (GENIE is a.
fluorescent light) .
 
Well Ali Baba had forty robbers against them
Scheherazadie had a thousand tales
Ukampis master you in luck 'cause up your manga
You have a brand of magic that never fails!
 
(GENIE creates 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
GENIE appeared in a jacket, then removed his arms and put them on in boxes
thieves to obey.)
 
You've got some power in your corner now
Some great ammo in your camp
You have some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
See all you have to do is flick that lamp
And I’ll say it
 
(Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN is in the corner, massaging it
Created by GENIE. The GENIE then turns into a pile of fireworks and.
it exploded. The GENIE then appears under the lamp and grabs ALADDIN's lamp
his hand against the lamp.)
 
Mr. Aladdin's brother
What will be the joy of it?
I'll take your order, write
You never have a friend like me
No, no, no, no!
 
(GENIE pulls out a table and chairs, then throws things a.
notes, a waiter . )
 
Life is your kitchen
And my maitre' d!
C'mon whisper whatever you like
You never have a friend like me.
 
(GENIE appears as a chicken dish, then returns to normal,
but he dilates his ears to hear ALADDIN. Finally, he explodes
into four duplicate GENIEs.)
 
Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
Jumax chief, king, shah!
Say what you want, it’s yours! The real food
How about some more Baklava?
 
(The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN
appears surrounded by a comfy chair (eh?) with treasure
and ventilation by women. GENIE appears and fills
screen with baklava.)
 
Try some in column 'A'.
Try the entire column 'B' .
I'm intent on helping you dude
You never have a friend like me
 
(ALADDIN rises over a column of food, with a capital A on it,
then jumps to another column with a B at the top. He’s a lifter
and held by the cushion held by the GENIE. He opens his mouth,
and its mouth becomes a staircase. A little GENIE
comes out dressed as a magician.)
 
(Mini GENIE also does a little dance with two of GENIE's giants
hands on. Finally, spin the mini GENIE and squish it
it makes him nothing.)
 
Can your friends do it?
Do your friends do that?
Did your friends pull this little one out of his hat
Your friends can go poof!
Nice looky here
If your friends can go to Abracadabra, let 'er rip
And then lose your heartbeat?
 
(GENIE takes it out of his head, duplicates it, and juggles it.
He throws it at ALADDIN, who juggles it with one arm and spins it
a head in the shape of a basketball in the palm of your hand. He tosses
heads back to GENIE, who steps up to try and throw
itself out of a hat at its base. He spins and spins
until it becomes a small white powder. The rabbit changes
a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment at EPCOT Center).
The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,
who dance around ALADDIN. As he begins to enjoy them,
they are lost.)
 
So don't sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
I am here to answer all your midday prayers
You got it bona fide, certified
You got a genius for a position? d'affairs is welcome!
I had a desire to help you
So I really want to know what you want
A wish three miles away, no doubt
So just rub it in, and oh!
 
 
(GENIE imitates what ALADDIN says, then a
certificate is rolled to ALADDIN. GENIE said:
a list {written in Arabic} comes out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses
to pat her back as she dries after a shower.)
 
Mr. Aladdin, sir, you have a wish or two or three wishes
I'm at work, you great nabob
You don't never have a friend, you don't have a friend
You don't never have a friend, you don't have a friend
You've never...had... a... friend... like me!
You don’t have a friend like me!
 
(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans down to kiss one of them.
He turns into a GENIE who zaps four dancing elephants
existence. On the other hand, he zaps four dancing camels,
and a grand finale dance number. The ABU, too, takes the gold
as best he can, but GENIE wraps everything in a cyclone and.
zaps it away until everyone's back in the cave. GENIE is a
neon "APLAUSE" sign in the background. The ABU turned its hat and.
sees that it is empty.)
 
GENIE: So what's going to happen, Master?
ALADDIN: What three wishes would you grant me?
GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. There is a
a few provisos, a few quid pro quos
ALADDIN: How is it?
GENIE: Ah, the first rule: You can't kill anyone. (The
cuts off his head with his hand.) So don't
ask. Rule number two: I can’t make anyone fall in love
with someone else. (The head becomes a large pair
lips which kiss ALADDIN.) You little puny, there.
(Sorrow sleeps, then wakes up and a
zombie.) Rule Three: You can't bring people back
dead bodies. Not a pretty picture, (He catches himself
ALADDIN then shakes it off) I don't like doing it! (The
poofs back to normal.) Other than that, you get it
the!
ALADDIN: (looks at ABU like plot) Ah, provisos? You
that means limitations? About desires? (to ABU) Some of them all
powerful genius--you can't turn people away
dead bodies. I don't know, Abu--maybe not
get me out of this hole. That’s how we’ll do that
must find a way out of here--
 
(They start to walk away, but a giant green foot steps in front of them
them.)
 
GENIE: Excuse me? You're looking at it
me? Did you stick my lamp? You woke me up, you made me
did you bring me here? And suddenly, you
walkin' out with me? (More mad and madder) I
don’t think so, not now. You’ll find it
needs, so siddown! (Everyone enters ALFORMA.
GENIE is a stewardess with many.
hands pointing out mixtures.) In case of
emergency, exits here, here, here, .
aka, aka, aka, aka, aka, aka, aka,
here, somewhere! Put your hands and arms underneath
the carpet is called. Weeee'rrrrrreee...get out of here!
 
(ALFORMA and passengers run out of the desert sand
access to remote locations. The value of the int. in the SULTAN's room. JAFAR the
includes IAGO, JASMINE and SULTAN.)
 
SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage. If it weren’t for everyone
years of faithful service… . From now on,
you must discuss with me the trial of the prisoners,
before being decapitated.
JAFAR: I'm telling you, be proud, it won't happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, let's get this all messy now
business is behind us. Please?
JAFAR: As my most abject and humble apologies to you
well done, princess. (He kisses her hand, but.
he's also a yank.)
JASMINE: There will be some benefit from my obliging
marriage. When I am queen, the.
it's hard to get away from you.
SULTAN: That’s good. Everyone had settled down, that way. Now, Jasmine, .
returning to this pretender's business, (he
looks up and sees Jasmine coming out) Jasmine?
Jasmine is alright! (She runs after him).
JAFAR: If only I had found the lamp!
IAGO: (as JASMINE) I'm strong enough to save myself
you! D'oh! For example--let's keep kissing
up to that chump, and for chump's daughter
in the rest of our lives.
JAFAR: No, Iago. Just until you find a chump guy.
Then he will see us banished--or beheaded!
PANI: ¡Eeewww!
IAGO: (Thinking) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Jafar is the one? What if you were a chump guy?
JAFAR: (He looks down at IAGO) What?
IAGO: Well, you marry the princess,okay? Then, uh, .
you have become the sultan!
JAFAR: Oh!Marry the moss? I became the sultan. There's an idea
merit is good enough!
IAGO: Yes, merit! If! And then the dad-in-law and.
little woman on a rock! (Dive bombs are.
floor) Kersplat!
JAFAR: Iago, I love how your dirty little mind works!
 
(Both laugh, we cut to an oasis in the desert, where ALFORMA is
enters a surface.)
 
GENIE: (Still as a stewardess) Thank you for choosing magic
Carpet for all your travel needs. Don't stand up
until the carpet is completely stopped. (How
ALADDIN and ABU descend the ladder form
ALFORNA) Thank you. Very nice, very nice! Thank you!
Goodbye! (Return to normal) Okay, now. Been
that, sir doubt mustfa?
ALADDIN: Oh, you're right. Now my top three favorites-
GENIE: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You’ve gone downstairs
ONE, young man!
ALADDIN: Ah, no--not really the.
hole. You’ve done it yourself.
 
(GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops. He's a.
lamb.)
 
GENIE: Well, don't you feel sheepish? All right, you
baaaaad boy, but no more freebies.
ALADDIN: Do the right thing. Well, three wishes. I wish they were
Well. (to GENIE) What do you want?
 
(GENIE hangs like a hammock between two trees).
 
GENIE: Me? No one has ever asked me that before. Thus, in
Nayan casojaxa, ah, Armasim.
ALADDIN: What? No, please tell me.
GENIE: Freedom .
ALADDIN: Are you a prisoner?
GENIE: It's all half a plot, the whole genie gig.
(Giantly growing, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic
the powers! (She shrinks, stuck in the MAGIC LAMP.)
Itty bitty living room
ALADDIN: Genie, that's terrible.
GENIE: (Coming out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free. No
have to go "Poof! What do you want? Poof! What do you have to do."
do you want to? Poof! What do you want?" To be myself
teacher, that would be the greatest of all
magic and all the treasures in all the world! But
what are you talking about, here? Let’s get real
here. It won't happen. Genie, wake up and.
the smell of hummus
ALADDIN: Why not?
GENIE: Just to get out of it my master
they love me. So you can imagine how often this happens
in the hands of.
ALADDIN: I will. I will rescue you.
GENIE: (Head becomes Pinocchio, wide eyed) Uh
huh, right. Wow!
ALADDIN: No, of course, I promise. (He pulls his nose in again
and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my
my first two wishes, and my third wish I will appoint you
free. (He raises his hand)
GENIE: Well, this is hopin'. (Shakes ALADDIN'S arm).
OK Let's do some magic! (Now a
magician.) So how 'bout it. What's your favorite thing
most?
ALADDIN: Well, there's this girl--
GENIE: Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and the GENIE's chest is a
heart with a cross through it.) Wrong! I can't
making someone fall in love, remember?
ALADDIN: Oh, but Genie. She's smart and fun and.
GENIE: ¿Wali sum?
ALADDIN: Very nice. He has these eyes that are just…and
this hair, wow...and her smile.
GENIE: (I'm sitting in a coffee shop in Paris with ABU and CARPET.)
Ami. C'est l'amour .
ALADDIN: But she's a princess. And to have a chance, I did
have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince?
GENIE: See here. (It has the "Royal Cookbook".) Uh,
chicken a'la king? (Take a chicken a
crown on his head) No. Alaskan king crab?
(Janks out his finger, and SEBASTIAN crabs and we see it
"The Mermaid" with clamp.) Ow, I
hate when they do that. The Caesar salad? (A
the dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu, .
Is it brute? Ah, to make a prince. (Knows the sly heart
ALADDIN.) Now is that an official wish? There’s a smile
feedback!
ALADDIN: Genie, you want to make me a prince!
GENIE: Well done! Woof woof woof woof! (Takes the square
hands and like Arsenio Hall. Then it’s like that
a tailor/fashion designer.) First, the fez and
jacket combo is still in the third century . These
patches--what do you mean--beggar? No!
Let’s work with me here. (He’s ALADDIN’s house
measurements, crosses his arms and ALADDIN is
outfitted in his princely suit.) I like it, muy
macho! Now, it’s lovely. What is he doing
sapxita? It says transport mode. Excuse
me, young monkey! Here, here it is! (ABU tries it
ALFORMA covers him, but GENIE zaps him and.
he runs away.)
ABU: Oh yes!
GENIE: Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE having a game
show set, where ALADDIN is standing behind a podium
"AL" on it.) And what better way to do it than you
greater entrance to the streets of Agrabah than
riding your own new camel! Be careful,
it’s a dance! (One of the doors carries a GENIE's head
opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel. The
spits from side of mouth on cue. But the.
GENIE doesn't know.) Mmm, not necessary. (He’s his own
hands and ABU becomes a beautiful white horse.)
It's very difficult. Let’s see. What do you need to do?
(GENIE waves her arms several times, turning around
ABU into: a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57
Cadillac, with "ABU 1" license plate. (That one…
an opinion, I don't know cars, but judging by their heart
flippers, 'nuff he said.) Finally, he's back
normal.) Yes!! Esalalumbo, shimin dumbo, and so on! Wow!!
(And the keyword in the spell is Dumbo, ABU turns
turned into an elephant. ALFORMA tries to get out of it
under ABU's size 46 feet.) Talk about your trunk
space, check out this action!
 
(ABU sees the reflection in the pool of water, then jumps into a tree.
The forest naturally returns to the ground, where ABU
hangs on and looks up at ALADDIN.)
 
ALADDIN: Abu, you're so beautiful.
GENIE: He's wearing clothes, he's got an elephant, though
we are not finished yet. Hang your turban, .
baby, because we’re gonna make you a star!
 
(With the distant oasis we slowly zoomed in, like fireflies
began to explode outward. Cut a CU into a toy stack.
(Look for the BEAST here.) We tilt and see the SULTAN
balancing them out. He carefully balances the last piece on top, .
and he sat down and coughed. However, Typhoon JAFAR comes in heavily, and.
pilax t’unjasi.)
 
JAFAR: Sir, I have found a solution to the problem
phuchamaxa.
IAGO: Aww! Trouble with your daughter!
SULTAN: Oh, really?
JAFAR: (Opens a scroll) Right here. "The princess."
nor does she choose a man,
which the sultan will choose for himself."
SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all the suitors! (He's trying
putting a cookie in IAGO's mouth. IAGO is supported
far. The SULTAN throws the biscuit unconsciously
back.) How can you choose someone who hates him?
(IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly a
sticks a cookie in his mouth.)
JAFAR: Don't worry, liege. There's more to it than that. The box, the box
event a good prince cannot be found, a princess
then get married...hmm...interesting.
SULTAN: What is it? Who?
JAFAR: The royal vizier! Why, that could be…me!
SULTAN: Why, I think the law says only one prince
marrying a princess, I’m pretty sure.
JAFAR: Troubled times call for troublesome measures, my
Sir. (He pulls out the stick and hypnotizes the.
SULTAN with it.)
SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...
JAFAR: You asked the princess to marry me.
SULTAN: I will...ask...princess......(spell
breaks momentarily)…but you’re too old!
JAFAR: (Approaches Thaja) The princess is getting married
nayaru!
SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell again
broken, this time by the "Prince" trumpet fanfare
Ali".) What? What is it? The music! Ha ha ha.
Jafar., you must come and see this!
 
(We see a parade advancing, led by what looks like GENIE
the human form is a BIG.)
 
MARCHERS: Make way for Prince Ali!
SWORDMAN: Say hey! It’s Prince Ali!
BIG: Hey, clearing the way in the old bazaar,
Hey you, let's get through, it's a bright new star,
Come now, meet his eye for the first time on your block!
Make your way, here he comes,
Ringing bells, banging drums.
You love this guy
 
(Great man struggling between different people.)
 
Prince Ali, fabulous he is, Ali Ababwa!
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee
 
(ABU the elephant walks through the city, riding ALADDIN (ALI) on its back.)
 
Try not to worry too much now
Sunday's brush with Salaam
And come and meet his spectacular coterie.
 
(IAGO is dancing to the music while JAFAR looks at him. The.
LARGE "wheelbarrows" of six people climb the ABU trunk. They're standing up
in each other’s arms as ALI shakes hands.)
 
Prince Ali, you are strong, Ali Ababwa!
As strong as ten regular men, in fact
He was faced with a running crowd
A hundred villains with swords
Who sent these goons to their masters, why Prince Ali!
 
(In ALI, the battery is destroyed, but there is lightning in a GENIE (tm) country
zaps the stack and he ends up holding everyone in an acrobatic move
wheel manufacturing. GENIE becomes an adult, then a child
and says the last two lines to the crowd.)
 
MEN'S CHORUS:(Bearing camels) He's got seventy-five golden camels!
 
(In pops mä typical parade commentator)
 
HARRY: Don't they look lovely, June?
 
CHORUS OF WOMEN: (On float) Purple peacock, she's fifty-three!
 
(In comes another commenter).
 
JUNE: Fabulous, Harry, I love my feathers!
 
GENIE: (GENIE exits the screen, a giant gorilla balloon descends
uka parade) .
When it comes to mammals of exotic type
He has a zoo, I tell you
It’s a world class menagerie!
 
(GENIE enters as a leopard, then as a goat, and says the last two words
already lines to two children. We cut to a balcony, .
where three HAREM GIRLS are accompanied by a HAREM GENIE.)
 
GENIE: 1.1.
GIRL: (on couterpoint) .
Prince Ali, Beautiful he, Ali Ababwa
There's no question this Alix is ​​alluring
The body, how can I talk
Never ordinary, never boring
Weak in the knees
Everything about the man is amazing
So, go out in the square
He’s amazing, he’s a whiz, amazing
Adjust your veil and get ready
He is about to tear my hair out
Gawk and grovel at Prince Ali!
And I love how she dresses!
 
(JASMINE looks out from the balcony of the palace. She.
humphs it off, and walks away.)
 
CHORUS: He has ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
(He got monkeys, see the monkeys!)
And he doesn't charge you anything to watch them!
(He is generous, so generous)
He has slaves, he has servants and flunkies!
(It's an honor to work for him)
They bow to his whim, they love to serve him
They’re messed up with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali is the one!
 
(ALADDIN throws gold coins at the crowd, who quickly approach him
let us collect these. ABU and the parade on the steps of the.
palace and inside. THE SULTAN runs to the door
to the throne room, but JAFAR is standing in front of the door.
Suddenly it breaks, ABU takes the lead, and destroys it
JAFAR and IAGO are behind the door.)
 
GENIE: Prince Ali!
Amorous he is! Ali Ababwa
Your dressed princess was a sight we loved seeing!
And that,well folks, is why
He went there disguised as a doll
Sixty elephants, llamas galore
Osonakapampi, leonanakapampi
A brass band
With their forty fakirs, cooks and bakers
His birds warble in the key
Make way for Prince Ali!
 
(More cheers until ALADDIN jumps off ABU's back
the MAGIC CARPET then runs into the SULTAN. JAFAR is slightly less
the door is closed.)
 
SULTAN: (Applause) Splendid, absolutely amazing.
ALADDIN: (In a deeper voice.) Ahem. Your Majesty, I have
I went from afar to seek your daughter’s hand.
SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course. I was very happy with the results
to meet you. (She rushes over and shakes ALI's hand).
This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He’s very excited
too.
JAFAR: (Very dry) Ecstatic. I’m afraid, Prince
Abooboo--
ALADDIN: --Dogs!
JAFAR: Whatever. You can't just parade here without an invitation
and wait--
SULTAN: ...By Allah, this is an amazing device.
(She pulled the tassels, and they were hers
mustache.) I don't think I might.
ALADDIN: Why indeed, your majesty. Please answer me.
 
(He helps SULTAN into the ALFORMA, which he plops down.
JAFAR slams into the CARPETS and rolls to the floor.)
 
JAFAR: Sir, I have to advise you on this--
SULTAN: --Oh, look at the button, Jafar. Learn to have some fun.
 
(He throws the sticks and ALFORNA and SULTAN run. IAGO, who
it was standing at the head of the stick, falling, several times
bopping the staff with his beak as he descends. SULTAN and.
ALFORMA flies high under the ceiling, launches a dive-bomb attack,
Running inside ABU, scaring him off. The race continues
in the background, and JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.)
 
JAFAR: Or where did you say you came from?
ALADDIN: Oh, you've been fast, I'm sure.
(He smiles. JAFAR doesn't).
JAFAR: Please try me. (IAGO lands on staff.)
SULTAN: Look, Polly!
 
(Everyone ducks in time as ALFORMA gets centimeters of their…
heads of state. CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)
 
IAGO: Hey, look out. Look with that sweet rug!
 
(ALFORMA zooms in on IAGO, who proudly wipes his nose, and.
lean against a pillar. He ran to the floor, and his head
is surrounded by miniature SULTANS on Carpets, saying "Have a Graller,
have a cookie. The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)
 
SULTAN: Out of the way, I'm entering the land. Jafar , 1999 .
look at this! (He gets to the ground.)
JAFAR: Spectacular, congratulations.
SULTAN: Ooh, lovely. Yes, I seem to have a skill
the. (ALFORMA walks upside down to ABU, by the way
destroy. ABU caught up.) This is still
amazing young people. And a prince too. (Now he's asking
to JAFAR) If we’re lucky, we won’t have to get married
Jasmine after all.
JAFAR: I don't trust him, sir.
SULTAN: Bad words. One thing I'm proud of Jafar, me
a good judge of man.
IAGO: Oh, good judge, yes, of course...no!!!
 
(JASMINE quietly enters).
 
SULTAN: Jasmine likes this!
ALADDIN: And I already love princess Jasmine!
JAFAR: Your Highness, no. I have to pray for Jasmine
ingredients. (JASMINE gets angry.) Here
the boy is no different from the others. What's going on
do you think she is suitable for the princess?
ALADDIN: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He snorts
JAFAR's goatee, which is all out
directions.) Just contact me. I'll be able to win
¡phuchama!
JASMINE: How dare you! (Everyone looks surprised).
All of you, do you stop to decide the future? I
i’m not going to win a prize! (He comes out very cold).
SULTAN: Oh, my dear. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Give it a go
Jasmine time to cool down. (They’re out).
JAFAR: I think it's time to say hello to Prince
Abooboo is a slow mover .
 
(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night. We tilt and find it
ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)
 
ALADDIN: What am I supposed to do? Jasmine hasn't left me either
you need to talk to him. I should have known that I could not throw
off this stupid prince want. (ABU should be disputed
the elephant's legs kick open a banana . He snorted
that, and the banana sticks in his nose. He’s like that
tosses the banana shell mä pile pile of the...
same.)
GENIE: (to the carpet, playing chess) So move on! (ALFORMA box,
a black spot falls off the board.) Hey.
That’s a good move. (as Rodney Dangerfield) I
can't believe it--I lost it with a rug.
ALADDIN: Genie, I need help.
GENIE: (as Jack Nicholson) Well, sparkle, this is.
deal. You want to court the little lady, you gotta
be a true warrior, do ya follow?
ALADDIN: What?
GENIE: (Reverts to normal, wearing mortar board. He points
takes words from a board) Tell him
the...THE TRUTH!!!
ALADDIN: That's not it! When Jasmine found out that I was actually a bit of a person
crummy street rat, he was laughing at me. (The
wears a turban, which glows like a GENIE.)
GENIE: A woman appreciates a man who makes her laugh!
(ALADDIN turns off the light and drops the chain.
GENIE comes out with a real turban.) Al, all
kidding aside, you really have to find yourself.
ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing. Ok,
I’m going to see him. I feel good, cool, .
sure. How do you look like?
GENIE: (Sadly) Like a prince.
 
(ALADDIN runs to the balcony of the SHEEP. JASMINE is in bed,
and the greatness of the . RAJAH is next to him.)
 
ALADDIN: (From the wrong side) Princess Jasmine?
 
(The RAJAH looks up and growls).
 
JASMINE: Is there anyone there?
ALADDIN: I--Prince Ali. Ahem--(And he jumped into his own
inner voice) prince Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE: I don't want to see you.
ALADDIN: No, no, princess. Give me a chance. (RAJAH is a man
growled and advanced towards him.)
JAFAR: Just leave me alone.
ALADDIN: ¡Alayax kitty!
 
(From the top of the balcony, CARPET looks down with GENIE.)
 
GENIE: How about our beau?
 
(ALFORMA cuts her throat with her hand).
 
ALADDIN: Good kitchen, get up. It's a slow motion. (He gets up
his turban to brush against the RAJAH.)
JASMINE: (She looks at him saying she saw him
first.) Wait, wait. Do I know you, guys?
ALADDIN: (Quickly shifting his turban) Uh, no, no.
JASMINE: You remind me of someone I met at the market.
ALADDIN: The market? (A bee buzzes around his head).
I have servants who market for me.
Why do I even have market servants
for my servants, so I can’t be you
they were introduced.
JASMINE: (She looks disappointed.) No, I don't think so.
BEE: (It's the GENIE) It's enough to mention you, Casanova. Talk
let's talk about him! She's smart, happy, hair, eyes.
Whatever--pick an action!
ALADDIN: Um, Princess Jasmine? You're still.
ABJE: Amazing, great, great, timely!
ALADDIN: Just in time!
JASMINE: On time?
BEE: That's right.
ALADDIN: Very nice.
BEE: Good treatment.
JASMINE: That's a little bit. I’m rich, you know.
ALADDIN: Come on!
JASMINE: The daughter of a sultan
ALADDIN: I know.
JASMINE: A nice prize for any prince wedding.
ALADDIN: Uh, right. Ok. A prince like me.
BEE: (Whispering in his ear) Understanding! Communication!
JASMINE: Sure, a prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, .
swaggering, peacock I know!
BEE: (Back on fire, glasses on and noise) Mayday!
May it be a day!
JASMINE: Just go jump off a balcony! (He turns and leaves)
ALADDIN: What?
BEE: Stop him! Protect him! Do you want me to fuck her?
ALADDIN: (Abeja ukar ch'allt'asi) ¡Buzz off!
BEE: Okay, okay. But remember--you're your own bee! (BEE entered the buzzes
turbantepa) .
ALADDIN: Yeah, right!
JASMINE: What!?!
ALADDIN: Uh, you're right. You are not a prize
won. (He looks disappointed.) You must be free
to decide for yourself. (JASMINE and RAJAH look on
interfering with each other.) Now go. (The
climbs the ledge.)
JASMINE: No!
ALADDIN: (Tips his head) What? What?
JASMINE: (Shocked) How--how do you do that?
(He looks up and sees ALFORMA).
ALADDIN: The magic carpet.
JASMINE: That’s lovely. (ALFORMA shakes JASMINE'S shoulder
tassel.)
ALADDIN: You, uh, don't want to drive a car, do you?
Leave the palace, see the world.
JASMINE: Is it safe?
ALADDIN: Of course. Can you trust me?
JASMINE: (That's all-
important line) What?
ALADDIN: (Stretching out his hand as before) You trust me
nayaru?
JASMINE: (With a sly grin on her face) Yeah.
 
(He takes her hand and rises on the ALFORMA. Zooms into the sky,
throwing them both into the seats. The music was called “A Whole”.
New World" swollen. JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH watching
she looked at him questioningly. She smiles as they run over the palace
into the wall and into the sky.)
 
ALADDIN: I can show you the world
Bright, shiny, and beautiful.
Princess tell me, now when did you stay
Should your heart decide?
 
(ALFORMA zooms through town, pausing a
flower. She gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.
He smiles.)
 
I can open your eyes
Surprise you with surprise
The top, sides, and bottom
On a magic carpet walk
 
 
(ALFORMA does as ALADDIN sings, then magnifies the clouds).
 
A new world!
Mä machaq fantastic point of view
No one is saying no
Or wherever you go
Or suppose we are dreaming
 
(SMILE Looks behind her and sees Agrabah disappear from view. ALFORMINA
flies through and out of the clouds.)
 
JASMINE: A new era
A shocking place I never knew
But when you get here
It’s crystal clear
I’m in a whole new world with you now!
 
ALADDIN: I'm in a whole new world with you now!
 
(Each catches a small cloud as the ALFORMA continues to fly. It is.
then revolves around a pillar of cloud to which he implies a rotation.)
 
JASMINE: Incredible views
Unexplainable feeling
Laughing, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
 
(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks terrified
and vomiting. ALFORMA does somersaults and flips, sometimes puts on
ALADDIN and JASMINE free-fall, but catch them. They are and
magnify above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)
 
JASMINE: A whole new world!
ALADDIN: Don't you dare open your eyes
JASMINE: There are a hundred thousand different things to see
ALADDIN: Hold your breath--you're better!
JASMINE: I feel like a shooting star,
I’ve come a long way
I can't go back to where I was before!
 
(They zoom in on a river, apparently the Nile, which is.
the ship's sails are the Great Pyramid . They shake hands with an employee
Sculpting the entire forehead of the Sphinx. He smiles, though
chisels too much and breaks the first section of the eye.)
 
ALADDIN: A new world!
JASMINE: Every turn is a surprise
ALADDIN: With new horizons to follow
JASMINE: Every moment, red letter
 
(They run to the running wild horses. JASMINE pets one of them).
 
BOTH: I'll follow them somewhere
There’s time for it
Let me share this whole new world with you
 
A new era
That is where we are
 
(They run through Greece, where ALADDIN gets an apple a
tree and lifts his arm to JASMINE, who is now safe
he has to deal with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)
 
ALADDIN: A fun chase
JASMINE: It’s an amazing place
PANI: For you and me!
 
(ALFORMA floats over a lake, and we see the reflection of the lake
the moon in the middle of the sea. Fireworks exploded and we saw the couple
sitting on a roof during the Chinese New Year celebration.)
 
JASMINE: It’s all so magical.
ALADDIN: Yes.
JASMINE: (Looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
It's a shame Abu had to miss this .
ALADDIN: Not at all. He hates fireworks. (ALFORMA looks up
realizing what is happening.) He doesn't really think so
just like flying. (And now ALADDIN understands)
It’s…oh no!
JASMINE: (She takes off her turban) You're the guy who.
commercial! I know that's it. Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I'm sorry.
JASMINE: You thought I was stupid?
ALADDIN: No!
JASMINE: I can't imagine that?
ALADDIN: No, I mean, I hoped you wouldn't. No, it’s not the case
what I was trying to say.
JASMINE: Who are you? Tell us the truth!
ALADDIN: Really? (He looks at CARPET who puts his arm around him,
giving up hope.) The truth...the truth is...me
sometimes they dress up as an ordinary person and escape
the pressures of palace life. (ALFORMA climbs up
defeat.) But of course I am a prince! (The pen is
his turban is pulled over his eyes.)
JASMINE: Why don't you just tell me?
ALADDIN: Well, you know, um...the royalty comes out
brand in disguise, sounds a bit weird,
do you not understand?
JASMINE: Not that surprising.
 
(She rubs her pen and hugs him. ALFORMA is a
the tassel is under the "chin" and looks mystified. The ext.
on the palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE are returning. RUG
forms a set of steps and he descends. Then ALADDIN descended
on the balcony just below.)
 
JASMINE: Goodnight, my handsome prince.
ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.
 
(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but ALFORMA kicks him and they.
kiss her sooner than she expects. He went slowly and back and
she looks at him. Finally enters the room through the curtain.)
 
ALADDIN: Yeah! (He goes back to the ALFORMA, he goes down
to the ground.) For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.
 
(Jasmine looks at her balcony, and four hands grab her).
 
ALADDIN: Hey! What? (A gag is attached to his mouth.
Muffled voice) Abu! Abu! (We see the elephant
hanging from a rope tied to a tree.)
GUARD: Hold him!
 
(The grenades are placed on his legs and arms. Another GUARD is tied up
ALFORMA is a knot around the tree.)
 
JAFAR: I'm afraid you're welcome, Prince
Abooboo is a slow mover . (Goes away.) He's all right
was never found.
 
(A GUARD hits him on the head, knocking him unconscious. Cut to a
cliff, where the GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body falls into the water.
He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock. The rock
he hits the bottom of the lake, then the turban lands and the lamp swings
out. She sees this and tries to shake the lamp. However, he is
he fell unconscious on the floor. The lamp is not stable
with his walk, he rolls down and hits his shoulders. It trembles, .
and GENIE mixed with bath brush, rubber duckie and shower cap)
 
GENIE: Never fails. Enter the bathroom and get a rub
the lamp of the lamp. (Duck squawks) Hello. (See also
foolish ALADDIN) Al? Al! Baby, get out of there!
You can’t cheat on this one! I can't help you
or make a wish. You say “Genie I”.
I want to save my life." Do you understand? Okay. C'mon
Aladdin is the one!! (He grabs ALADDIN by the arms and.
he shakes her off. His head rises, then falls.) I
the answer is yes. (Head becomes a mermaid).
Wooga! Wooga! (Becomes the inner ship.) Up
scope! (He talks about things
German language. A large stream of water flows from the top
out, and lands on the rock. The name of ALADDIN
he wakes up again and coughs up water from his lungs.)
Don’t be so scared!
ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(Can't figure out how to say it
that, so they hug.) Thank you, Genie.
GENIE: Oh, Al. I'm kind of in love, baby. No
they say they want to pull the curtains or something.
 
(Cut to JASMINE in her room, dancing to "A Whole New World" and brushing her teeth
his hair is slow. SULTAN appears in a double door,hypnotized.)
 
SULTAN: Jasmine!
JASMINE: Oh, sir--I just had a better time.
I’m so happy to be here.
SULTAN: (Very monotone under hypnosis) You must be,
Jasmine was like that. I have chosen a man for you.
JASMINE: What about you?
SULTAN: (Another door opens and reveals JAFAR.) You do
She married Jafar.
 
(JASMINE smiles at him).
 
JAFAR: You are speechless, I see. A good quality is a
female.
JASMINE: I'll never marry you. (He goes to the SULTAN)
Dad, I chose Prince Ali!
JAFAR: Prince Ali has left!
 
(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the balcony doorway).
 
ALADDIN: Please read your crystal ball again, Jafar!
JASMINE: Prince Ali!
 
(JAFAR smiles at ALADDIN).
 
IAGO: How's he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk!
ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar! You tried to be with me
killed by the sword.
JAFAR: What is it? (He goes to the SULTAN) Laughter
bad words, your majesty. He is obviously lying.
(He approaches the SULTAN's face and delivers the stick).
SULTAN: Obviously...lies.
 
(ALADDIN sees the staff with glowing eyes).
 
JASMINE: Dad, what's wrong with you?
ALADDIN: ¡Nayajj yattwa!
 
(ALADDIN seizes the staff and smashes it to the floor. JAFAR staggers
and the spell is broken for good.)
 
SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh!
ALADDIN: Your pride, Jafar used you
this! (He puts the workers first)
SULTAN: What is it? Jafar is the one? You, you traitor!
 
(The three men lead the way in JAFAR.)
 
JAFAR: Your Majesty, all of this can be explained.
SULTAN: ¡Guardanaka! ¡Guardanaka!
IAGO: Well, it's--we're dead, and forget it. Fair
dig us both a grave. We’re dead and dying.
 
(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket. He makes a move, but.
which is held by the guards.)
 
SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once.
JAFAR: This isn't done yet, boy!
 
(JAFAR takes a vial from his pocket. ALADDIN sees this and hurries away
him, but JAFAR threw the vial on the floor. A big red cloud
appears. When it disappears, so does JAFAR.)
 
SULTAN: Find him, look for him everywhere!
ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you alright?
JASMINE: Yeah.
 
(They rub up for a kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them).
 
SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted adviser, deciding against
me all the time. It’s so terrible. How can I always- .
(He stops mid-sentence and looks at the two of them).
Is it true? My daughter eventually a
pretender to the right? (He shakes his head) Ha ha! Praise be to Allah! You
brilliant boy, kiss me! I don't--I won't
that's my--. You two will be married together!
Yes, yes. And you’ll be happy and prosperous, and.
then my son, you will be the sultan!
ALADDIN: The Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, a well-built young man like you, a
man of impeachable moral character
exactly what this kingdom needs! (ALADDIN looks on
and anxiety.)
 
(Cut to int. by JAFAR's cameras. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)
 
IAGO: We gotta get out of here! We have to find out-- I have to find out
start packing, your pride. Only the most important things.
(IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage.
JAFAR smiles broadly.) Travel light! Bring it to me
gun, weapons, knives (Goes and takes
a picture of him and JAFAR) and how
this picture? I don't know--I think I'm making one
strange face there. (JAFAR starts laughing heavily).
Oh, boy--he's gone nuts. He's torn apart. (IAGO) (IAGO)
ran up to him and hit him on the head.) Jafar?
Jafar is the one? Hold one, Jafar! (JAFAR catches him around
neck) Good grip!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing more than that green bear
Aladdin is a brother. He has the lamp, Iago.
IAGO: Why is it miserable--
JAFAR: But you have to calm him down!
IAGO: Me?
 
(Cut to ext. of palace. ALADDIN looks out over the gardens.)
 
ALADDIN: The Sultan? Do they want me to be a sultan?
 
(GENIE comes out of the lamp)
 
GENIE: Huzzah! Hail the victorious hero! (Now a
one-man band. He sees ALADDIN walking with him
head hanging down. He stops, nods, comes
with an idea, and expands it to ALADDIN . He’s holding it
hands up like a director on a photo scope
we look between them.) Aladdin, you've just won
her heart belongs to the princess. Whatever you do
coming? (ALADDIN enters looking at him
to the bed of sorrow, where he fell upon it and sobbed.
GENIE regained consciousness and threw herself at him
a script titled "Aladdin". Ask: ) .
Psst, the line is "I want to save my genius".
There is a time.
ALADDIN: Genie...I don't.
GENIE: Of course you do. You just go "Genie, I need you."
free." (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses it
him as a mock ventriloquist dummy. ALADDIN is far away.)
ALADDIN: I'm still thinking. Look, I'm sorry--I really am. But
they want to make me a sultan--no!, They want to make me
Prince Ali is the sultan. Without you, I’m just Aladdin.
GENIE: Al, you win!
ALADDIN: Because of you! The only reason who I am
something is there for you. What if they find out?
Am I not really a prince? (Quietly) How can it be done
Does Jasmine know this? I will lose him. Genie, I don't think so
kept this going myself. I don’t want to save you.
GENIE: (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand. Actually, .
you lied to everyone. Hey, I was getting started
to feel abandoned. Now, if you'll excuse me, .
teacher. (So, the last word is spoken in anger
poofs back to the lamp.)
 
(ABU and CARPET look out the window).
 
ABU: Ohhh and so on.
ALADDIN: Genie, I'm really sorry. (A mouthful of.
spouts and raspberries at him.) Okay, okay. (He snorts
on a LAMP pillow.) Then stay put
there! (He looks at ABU and ALFORNA.) What are you
young people are watching? (They both leave.) Look, I--I
I'm sorry. Wait, Abu-- wait--I'm sorry, can't--
wait, c'mon. (He sighs.) What am I doing?
Genie is right--I have to tell Jasmine the truth.
JASMINE: (From the wrong side) Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?
ALADDIN: (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes. (He's walking around
into the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?
 
(We see IAGO wearing a tail and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO
in the pond. He is imitating JASMINE's voice.)
 
IAGO: Ahem--in the Menagerie, immediately.
ALADDIN: I'm coming.
 
(We see ALADDIN rushing past, not seeing the birds. IAGO laughs,
and turns back to face the face of a FLAMINGO, he is
with a smile.)
 
FLAMINGO: Nothing!
IAGO: Ya a problem, pinky? (He's got to clean the bird
the legs come out of it. IAGO runs into the palace
and finds the lamp under the pillow.) Boy, Jafar
glad to see you! (He rubs his face
looks like JAFAR and learns.) Good job, Iago!
(Normal) Ah, go ahead. (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale
out of ten, you’re eleven! (Normal) Ah, that's it.
Jafar--you are too kind. I'm embarrassed, I am
yellow snowflakes. (He flips the lamp).
 
(Cut to palace entrance. The SULTAN is standing at the top, doing it
a message to the public.)
 
SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter is at last a.
the suitor is welcome!
 
(Cut to behind curtain, where JASMINE is watching. ALADDIN
appears at the bottom of the stairs.)
 
ALADDIN: Jasmine?
JASMINE: Ali, where did you go?
ALADDIN: Something I have to tell you.
JASMINE: The whole kingdom belongs to her father
communication!
ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!
JASMINE: Good luck! (He throws her on the platform
with the SULTAN, where he's all over it
many.)
SULTAN: ... Ali Ababwa!
ALADDIN: ¡Ay, wayna!
 
(At the top, IAGO and JAFAR look out of a window).
 
IAGO: Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
JAFAR: Let them be happy.
 
(Picks up the lamp and shakes it. GENIE steps out).
 
GENIE: You know Al, I feel it (turns and sees JAFAR)
reallyyyyy--I don't know him. (The
goes down and asks for a playbill.) Tonight, the
role of Al is a heavy, dark and.
sinister evil man.
JAFAR: I am now your master. (He pulled the GENIE
on the ground and puts his foot in GENIE's face.)
GENIE: That's what I was afraid of.
JAFAR: Genie, grant me my first wish. I want to rule on that
high, as the sultan!!!
 
(Cut to ext where dark clouds surround the castle. The castle shakes.
The roof cracks and the SULTAN and ALADDIN make ducks.)
 
ALADDIN: Well done!
SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What’s going on?
 
(His turban is off his head. When he catches it, it's his whole body
runs, and all clothes are taken off except his boxers
shorts are available. The dress reappeared in JAFAR.)
 
JAFAR: Nothing!
SULTAN: Jafar, you evil traitor.
IAGO: The Sultan Vile Traitor.
ALADDIN: Oh, huh? Well, we’ll see about that! (Pulls and more
takes the same turban, but finds it empty) Lamp!
JAFAR: Interrogator- viewers, Abooboo.
 
(They both look up and see a giant GENIE hovering over the palace
the clouds.. ALADDIN whistles and ALFORMA runs to greet him.
They fly right next to GENIE's head.)
 
ALADDIN: He's a bastard! No!
GENIE: Sorry, kid--I've got a new teacher now. (He's the.
a hilltop palace.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I command you to stop!
JAFAR: Now there's a new order--my order! Finally, you
he will bow down to me!
 
(SULTAN bows, but JASMINE doesn't).
 
JAFAR: We will never bow down to you!
IAGO: Why wasn't I surprised?
JAFAR: If you wouldn't kneel before a sultan, you would
fear in the presence of a witch! (to GENIE) Genie, my
my second wish--I want to be stronger
The wizard of the world!
 
(GENIE waves. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but can't,
and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning JAFAR,
restoring it to its normal shape.)
 
IAGO: Gentlemen, gentlemen, welcome to a good Agrabah
Witch Jafar!
JAFAR: Where are you now? Ah, yes--bad contempt!
(He zaps JASMINE and SULTAN with his staff, and.
they both bow down to him. RAJAH comes running towards him.
He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger gets a kitty-
cat.) Up, boy! Oh, princess--(raises her chin
with his staff)--there is someone with whom I want to die
to introduce you.
ALADDIN: (off camera) Jafar! Get your hands off him!
 
(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN. ALFORMA runs away.)
 
JAFAR: Prince Ali
Yes, he is,
But not as you know him.
Read my lips and hold on
Really
 
(JAFAR approaches the two in the air).
 
Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were so good, they didn't last forever
Hail Prince Ali!
 
(JAFAR turns ALI back to ALADDIN.)
 
IAGO: Or should I say Aladdin?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
 
JAFAR: So Ali just turned out to be Aladdin
It’s just a con, should I keep going?
Take it away from me
His personality is flawed
Give me a worthy cause
To send you packing on a road trip
So their hopes are in jeopardy
His belongings were frozen, their meeting place chosen
Is it the ends of the earth, whoopee!
So far, .
IAGO: Hello, watch out!
JAFAR: Former Prince Ali!
 
(JAFAR returns ABU to normal. He sends them both away
a tall pillar, and threw it like a rocket, but it didn't launch before
ALFORMA can enter F2B, and we see a blank wasteland, somewhere
the pillar collapses and falls. Finally it comes to a stop.
ALADDIN steps out, obviously cool.)
 
ALADDIN: Abu? Abu! (He has a shivering pile of.
snow.) Oh, this is all my fault--I have to
and the genius saved me when I was able. (He's digging
ABU steps out and cradles him under his jacket.) Abu!
Are you okay with it? I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess
everything, somehow. I have to go back and set
things are right. (He starts walking through the snow,
and eventually steps onto a frozen RUGS.)
Rug! (He looks up and sees the ALFORMA painted
the pillar. He beats himself up to try and save ALFORMATA. The
he can't do it, so he starts snoring
base of the pillar.) Abu, begin to recognize! The box
the! (Eventually, enough snow is removed, and.
the pillar begins to sway. ALADDIN runs away,
looks back, then swings into place. The pillar is beautiful
knocks him over, and when it's over, ALADDIN and
The ABU remains sitting on the patch made of snow
pillar window.) Yes! Alright! (The
turban facing, feared by ABU.
ALFORMA beat the wings and rushed to collect them
raise them up.) Now, back to Agrabah! Let’s go!
 
(We repeat the ext. long shot of Agrabah, covered in red clouds.
The value of the int. and slow zoom in the throne room. IAGO is the SULTAN
tied up like a puppet, and JASMINE is chained up next to it
throne.)
 
IAGO: Does the puppet master want a cookie? This is your cracker.
Shove 'em all the way up to the neck. Here, there is
lots!
 
(JAFAR removes the chain, and JASMINE approaches him with an apple).
 
JAFAR: Leave him alone!
 
(IAGO pauses for a second, then continues).
 
JAFAR: It's heartbreaking to see you this humiliated, Jasmine.
(He takes a bite out of the apple he's holding).
A beautiful desert flower as you should be
at the hands of the most powerful man in the world.
(She raises her hand and a wreath appears.) What can you do
you say, dear sister? Why, you and my queen…
 
(Picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face).
 
JASMINE: Absolutely!
JAFAR: Let me teach you some respect! (He falls back like her
reaches out his hand to strike him. Then he stands up.) Nope.
Genie, I decided to make the final decision. I
They want Princess Jasmine to fall easy
love with me.
 
(We see ALADDIN running back to town).
 
GENIE: (Again as Buckley) Ah, Professor-- there are a few
to be added, yaqhipa what for what- .
JAFAR: Don't get back at me, you stupid blue lout! You
will do what I say, slave!
 
(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, gesturing
then play the game.)
 
JASMINE: (She stands up and puts the crown on her head).
Jafar is a country! I never realized how incredible it was
you're beautiful.
 
(GENIE gets beat up.)
 
JAFAR: That's better. (He takes GENIE's jaw with a.
shadow.) Now, pussycat, tell me more
and…myself.
JASMINE: You're tall, well dressed...
 
(JAFAR approaches him. ALADDIN jumps with ABU and GENIE
sees them.)
 
GENIE: ¡Al! Al, jisk'a masi!
ALADDIN: ¡Shh!
GENIE: (He actually zips his mouth shut, then zips it shut).
Al, I can't help it--I work for the psychopath senor,
now. (His head becomes that of JAFAR's, then retreats).
ALADDIN: Hey--I'm a street rat, remember? (He's GENIE's rezip
mouth.) I improvise.
 
(He gets off a pile of money and hides near JAFAR and JASMINE.
The back of JAFAR is in ALADDIN.)
 
JAFAR: Go ahead.
JASMINE: And your beard is...so...tight! (He introduces her
wrapping her arms around him. He pretends he's running with her
finger, but is really beckoning ALADDIN
and to come to it. He makes his walk. IAGO sees him.)
 
IAGO: Gag--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth).
JAFAR: And the street rat?
JASMINE: Any street rats?
 
(They're about to kiss when IAGO manages to splash a bowl. JAFAR
he turns to look, but JASMINE holds him back and kisses him. The name of ALADDIN
his appearance is disgusting. Both IAGO and ABU are known for their hostility.)
 
ABU: ¡Yukja!
JAFAR: It's--(he sees ALADDIN's reflection in him
crown.) You!! How many times do I have it
to kill, boy?
 
(He zaps ALADDIN. JASMINE immediately pulls him away, and he.
land. ALADDIN quickly grabs the stick.)
 
ALADDIN: Take the lamp!
 
(JASMINE runs to it. But JAFAR chokes ALADDIN, like this
zaps an hourglass.)
 
JAFAR: Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!
 
(Sand starts falling on him from above).
 
ALADDIN: Jasmine!
IAGO: Oh, good shot, Jaf-- (he's shot by ABU.)
 
(ABU rushes for the lamp).
 
JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He zaps a toy monkey.
ALADDIN: ¡Abu!
 
 
(ALFORMA comes in soon.)
 
JAFAR: Things are heating up fast, now boy. (ALFORMA box
zapped and unravels. ALADDIN is again the.
lamp.) Can you think of that? (His path is blocked
great swords are stuck in the field. JAFAR caught it
lamp and laughing horribly. ALADDIN is a
sword out of the floor.) I'm just warming up
above! (He breathes a ring of fire next to ALADDIN.)
ALADDIN: You fear fighting me, you coward
Qatari?
JAFAR: A snake, right? You might want to see how
like a snake I would be! (He smiles broadly, and we.
see a snake sticking out from behind its mouth
teeth. Then it turns into a giant cobra, and.
ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes a part
the snake wrapped around ALADDIN. The snake JAFAR does
It goes to ALADDIN, and on the third attempt it goes to ALADDIN
sword strikes and hits JAFAR. Look at the GENIE
cheerleaders wearing 'A' sweaters.)
 
GENIE: Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick to the sword
the snake!
JAFAR: You stay heresss!
 
(GENIE pointing to a 'J' on a small banner.)
 
GENIE: (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't do it,
CLOSE!
 
(ALADDIN's distraction makes a break for the hourglass where.
JASMINE is in a state of shock. However, JAFAR saw this and blocked the way.
ALADDIN is knocked out, and loses his sword.)
 
JASMINE: Aladdin!
 
(ALADDIN jumps on a giant gem and rolls to the floor, getting caught
with the sword in his path. He turns a corner, but the chasing snake
it can't be, and the first half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and.
hanging outside the palace. ALADDIN jumped on the back of the snake
and stabs him to death. JAFAR screamed in agony. ALADDIN tries again
rescue the princess.)
 
ALADDIN: ¡Jasmine, warkt’asim!
 
(He's about to hit the glass with his sword, and JAFAR catches him).
 
JAFAR: (laughs evilly) You little fool! You’re right
you can defeat the strongest man on earth!
IAGO: (with GENIE coming from behind) Fuck him,
Jafar--Fuck him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him
to get out of the way) .
JAFAR: Without genius, boy, you have nothing!
ALADDIN: (A thought) The genius! That genius! The genius
stronger than it will ever be!
JAFAR: What!!
ALADDIN: He gave me your power, he can take it!
GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why did you bring me
in this direction?
ALADDIN: Look at you, Jafar--you're still second best!
JAFAR: You’re right! His power is stronger than mine! But
it doesn’t last long!
 
(JAFAR rotates around GENIE.)
 
GENIE: That boy is crazy. He's a little punch drunk. One
too many clashes with the snake (His hand
turns into a snake and hits him on the head with it.)
JAFAR: Slave, I make my third wish! I want to be a whole
mighty genius!
GENIE: (Reluctantly) Well, your will is my command.
For the road, Al.
 
(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) trademark lightning.
JAFAR's snake form disappears and he becomes a genius. We
see JASMINE's thumb disappear into the sand. The name of ALADDIN
collapsed and finally shattered the glass . Sand and the princess
you must pour it out.)
 
JAFAR: Yeah! If! That's the power! The absolute power!
JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
ALADDIN: Trust me!
 
(A blue lamp appears at JAFAR's base. JAFAR is conjuring.)
 
JAFAR: The universe is mine to command, to rule!
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Jafar! Are you forgetting something?
(JAFAR looks at him questioningly) You want to be a genius, you
I understand! And everything that goes with it!
 
(JAFAR's wrists are shackled).
 
JAFAR: No! No!
IAGO: I want to get out of here! Come on, you’re the one
genie, I don't want--
 
(IAGO tries to run, but is hit by JAFAR.)
 
ALADDIN: Phenomenal cosmic powers! Itty bitty living space.
GENIE: Al, you little genius, you!
 
(ABU returns to normal, ALFORMA ravels again, JASMINE, SULTAN
and RAJAH they stand together. RAJAH jumps into his arms
SULTAN, and all changed. SULTAN is crushed
there is the weight of the new RAJAH. The palace reappeared
where it used to be in the country. ALADDIN is the.
with a new lamp.)
 
JAFAR: (Both from under the lamp.) Take the puffy tail off
Where are the timers?
IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron!
JAFAR: I'm not telling you to shut up!
GENIE: Let me answer. (He takes the lamp and.
on the balcony. He's now wearing a baseball cap. The
the wind blows like a thrown lamp, but he opens his
palm flat and rolls into the desert
with his hand.) Ten thousand years in a cave
wonders must give him chills!
 
(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they lose. JASMINE walks away
to the ALADDIN. They hold hands, but both look sad).
 
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I lied to you a
Prince.
JASMINE: I know why.
ALADDIN: Well, I guess...this... is it right? (GENIE said this
his head rounded the corner and he marveled at his condition
ist'aña.)
JASMINE: Oh, that stupid rule. This isn't fair--I love you.
GENIE: (Wipes away a smile) Al, it's okay. You're still.
there was a desire. Just say the word and you have a
prince mayampi.
ALADDIN: But Genie, what about your freedom?
GENIE: Hey, only serve forever. This is
love. (She sits down next to him.) Al, you are
he won’t find another girl like her in a million
years. Believe me, I know. I've looked at it.
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I love you, but I have to stop
pretending to be something I don’t have.
JASMINE: I understand.
 
(They share one last glance into each other's eyes, and ALADDIN turns away
to the GENIE.)
 
ALADDIN: Genie, I want your salvation.
GENIE: A bona fide prince of pedigree coming up. I'm--what?
ALADDIN: (He holds the lamp to GENIE.) Genie, you are
knock it out!
 
(A transformation scene ensues in which the shackles fall off
GENIE's doll and lamp fell uselessly to the ground.
GENIE takes it and looks down.)
 
GENIE: (Disbelieving.) Heh, heh! I’m free to go. Am
free. (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.) Quickly,
quick, craving for anything. Say, “I want to.”
The Nile." Love the Nile. Try that!
ALADDIN: I want the Nile.
GENIE: It’s not like that!! (Laughs hysterically. He turns around
the balcony looks like a pinball.) Oh did you get that
Well! I am free! I was finally free! I'm hittin'.
thaki. I’m going to see the world! I--
 
(He's packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN staring at him
it’s a very sad thing.)
 
ALADDIN: Genie, I'll--I'll miss you.
GENIE: I'm sorry, Al. No matter what anyone says, you.
be a prince to me.
 
(They kiss. The SULTAN steps forward.)
 
SULTAN: That’s right. You have certainly proved your worth
as I have said. That’s the rule of thumb
jan walt'a.
JASMINE: ¿Tata?
SULTAN: Well, am I a sultan or am I a sultan? From today onwards
first the princess can marry whomever she wants
worthy.
JASMINE: (With a smile on her face, she runs into ALADDIN's arms).
Him! I choose…I choose you, Aladdin.
ALADDIN: Yeah, yeah. Please call me Al.
 
(They were about to kiss, when long green hands bring them all together.
GENIE wears a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and Goofy on it
sombrero.)
 
GENIE: Oh, all of ya. Come here to the right place. Great group hug!
Mind you I'm kissing the monkey? (He kisses ABU.) Ooh, .
it's heartbreaking! So, I can't do any more confusion around
stop this popcorn . I’m getting out of here! Bye, bye, goodbye.
you two crazy lovebirds. Hey, Rugman: ciao! Am
history! No, I am a mythologist! No, I didn't do anything
because I--I'm free!
 
(The GENIE flies off into the blue sky, leaving behind a sparkle
in the background. They cut it (a jump cut to make it worse) .
until a night of fireworks explosions. We sat down and watched
ALADDIN and JASMINE run through the ALFORMA.)
 
ALADDIN: A new era
JASMINE: A new life
PANI: (off-camera chorus) For you and me!
MALE CHORUS: A new era!
 
(They fly into the moonlight, and when they disappear,
the moon turns around and reveals the smiling face of the GENIE . Suddenly
film is "pulled out of the spotlight", GENIE elevates it
and looks at the audience.)
 
GENIE: ¡Made ya look!
 
(Returns movie to normal, with normal moon. Fade to black.
Finally.)
