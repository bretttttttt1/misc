That sounds fabulous.

00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:28,663
Well, it's not much, but
it's got a great view.

Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?

357
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,210
Oh, it's wonderful.

358
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,587
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

359
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,340
and have servants and valets.

360
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:44,141
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

361
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,429
It's better than here.

362
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,057
You're always scraping for
food and ducking the guards.

You're not free to
make your own choices.

What does it matter?

00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,415
I ran away and I am not going back.

369
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,585
- Really? How come?
- Why, you...

370
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,919
My father's forcing
me to get married.

371
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,259
That's... That's awful.

375
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,266
What?

376
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,102
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.

377
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:38,231
And does Abu have
anything else to say?

378
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,442
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

- They're after me!
- They're after you?

384
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,291
My father must have sent them...

- What?

other, don't we, street rat?

- Get off of me.

That's not your concern. Do as
I command. Release him.

399
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,466
I would, Princess, except
my orders come from Jafar.

Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

How may I be of service to you?

405
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,826
The guards just took a boy from
the market, on your orders.

406
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,700
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

407

- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

I can't breathe, Jafar.

409
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,667
Why, kidnapping the
princess, of course.

410
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,002
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!

411
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,672
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

Sadly, the boy's sentence has
already been carried out.

I'll never see her again.

531
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,316
It's all mine.

532
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:23,143
I... Where is it?

533
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,770
No.

534
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,774
No!

SULTAN: Oh, dearest.

537
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,202
What's wrong?

(SNIFFLING)

539
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,290
Jafar has

540
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,917
done something terrible.

541
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,712
There, there, my dear.

542
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,922
We'll set it right.

543
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,051
Now, tell me everything.

544
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,017
Oh.

545
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,682
Aladdin. Wake up.

546
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,480
Aladdin.

547
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,859
Oh! My head.

548
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,941
We're trapped.

549
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,194
That two-faced son of a jackal!

551
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:19,825
Whoever he was, he's long
gone with that lamp.

Aha!

00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:25,089
(CHUCKLING)
Why, you hairy little thief.

554
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,709
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

555
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,170
Hey, I think there's
something written here,

556
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:34,515
but it's hard to make out.

557
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,979
Aah!

558
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,606
Oy!

559
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,986
10,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

560
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,738
Hang on a second.

561
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,240
Whoa! Whoa!

562
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,743
Does it feel good
to be outta there.

563
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,953
I'm telling you, nice to be
back, ladies and gentlemen.

564
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,955
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

565
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,624
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

566
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,543
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

567
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,796
Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?

568
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:18,473
How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."

569
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,345
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

570
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,264
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
(GIGGLING)

571
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,975
Oh, sorry, Cheeta. Hope
I didn't singe the fur.

572
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,645
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen
you in a few millennia.

573
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:33,273
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.

574
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:37,111
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

575
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,487
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.

576
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,698
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?

577
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,701
Wait a minute. I'm your master?

578
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,870
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

579
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,123
The ever impressive,

580
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,418
the long contained,

581
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,502
the often imitated,

582
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,629
but never duplicated...

Genie of the Lamp!

585
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,512
Right here direct from the lamp,

586
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,181
right here for your very
much wish fulfillment.

587
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,599
Thank you.

588
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,853
- Whoa. Wish fulfillment?
- Three wishes, to be exact.

589
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,814
And ixnay on the wishing
for more wishes.

590
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,567
That's it. Three. <i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

No substitutions,

592

Now I know I'm dreaming.

593
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,241
Master, I don't think you quite
realise what you've got here.

594
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:29,964
So why don't you just ruminate whilst
I illuminate the possibilities.

Ah, rule number one,
I can't kill anybody.

Rule number two.

I can't make anybody fall

can't even get us out of this cave.

Looks like we're gonna have
to find a way out of here.

Excuse me?

00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,446
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

667
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,532
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

668
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,618
And all of sudden you're
walking out on me?

00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,537
I don't think so, not right now.

If it weren't for all your
years of loyal service...

678
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:24,398
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

Please.

684
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:42,207
My most abject and humblest
apologies to you as well, Princess.

685
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,377
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

686
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:49,506
When I am queen, I will have
the power to get rid of you.

There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.

00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:58,183
Now, Jasmine, getting back to
this suitor business... Jasmine?

"I will have the power
to get rid of you."

694
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,862
(GROWLING)
To think we gotta keep kissing up

695
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,615
to that chump and
his chump daughter

696
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,201
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.

697
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:22,289
Only until she finds
a chump husband.

698
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,417
Then she'll have us banished.

699
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,710
Or beheaded.

700
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,713

702
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,634
What if you were the chump husband?

703
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,927
What?

704
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:39,306
Okay, you marry the
princess, all right?

705
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:42,851
And, uh, then you become the sultan.

706
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,399
Oh.

707
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,314
Marry the shrew.

708
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,191
I become the sultan.

709
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:53,153
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

710
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:59,826
And then we drop papa-in-law and
the little woman off a cliff.

711
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,828

Good-bye. Thank you.

Well, how about that,
Mr Doubting Mustafa?

720
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:37,864
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

721
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,991
Dost mine ears deceive me?

722
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,161
Three? You are down by one, boy.

723
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:47,040
Ah, no. I never actually
wished to get out of the cave.

724
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,293
You did that on your own.

725
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,213
Well, I feel sheepish.

726
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:56,508
All right, you bad boy,
but no more freebies.

727
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,719
Fair deal. So, three wishes.

728
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,930
I want them to be good.

729
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,723
What would you wish for?

730
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,601
Me?

731
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,061
No one's ever asked me that before.

732
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,439
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

733
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,066
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

734
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,569
Come on. Tell me.

735
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,487
Freedom.

736
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,613
You're a prisoner?

737
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,074
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

738
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,828
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

739
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,329

740
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,582
Genie, that's terrible.

741
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,751
But, oh, to be free...

742
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,712
Not have to go, "Poof.
What do you need?

743
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,256
"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

744
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,258
To be my own master.

745
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,219
Such a thing would be
greater than all the magic

746
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,598
and all the treasures
in all the world.

747
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,974
But what am I talking about?

748
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,435
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.

749
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,937
Genie, wake up and
smell the hummus.

750
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,230
Why not?

751
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:56,276
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

752
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,820
So you can guess how
often that's happened.

753
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,488
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

754
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:04,826
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

755
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,494
After I make my first two wishes,

756
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,293
I'll use my third
wish to set you free.

757
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,209
Well, here's hopin'. All right.

758
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,419
Let's make some magic.

759
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,639
So how 'bout it? What
is it you want most?

760
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,384
Well, there's this girl.

761
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,510
Wrong.

762
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,347
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

763
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:29,809
Oh, but, Genie, she's
smart and fun and...

764
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,853
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

765
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,148
She's got these eyes that
just... And this hair. Wow.

766
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,776

769
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,448
But she's the princess.

770
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,909
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...

771
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,870
Hey, can you make me a prince?

772
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,288
Let's see here.

773
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,124

776
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:02,302
Aha. "To make a prince."

777
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,761
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

778
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,681
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

779
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,182

780
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,517
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

781
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:14,646

is much too third century.

we trying to say, beggar?

783
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,410
No. Let's work with me here.

Ooh. I like it. <i>Muy macho.</i>

785
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,532
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

786
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,368
It says mode of transportation.

00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,486
<i>He got dolled up and dropped by</i>

874
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,488
<i>With 60 elephants, llamas galore</i>

875
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,782
<i>With bears and lions
A brass band and more</i>

876
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,534
<i>With his 40 fakirs
His cooks, his bakers</i>

877
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,327
<i>His birds that warble on key</i>

878
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,496
<i>Make way</i>

879
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:30,221
<i>For Prince Ali</i>

880
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:34,799
Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.

881
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,009
(CLEARS THROAT)

882
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,052
Your Majesty,

883
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,722
I have journeyed from afar to
seek your daughter's hand.

884
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,557
Prince Ali Ababwa.

885
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:45,727
Of course. I'm
delighted to meet you.

886
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:50,023
This is my royal vizier,
Jafar. He's delighted, too.

887
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,774
Ecstatic.

888
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,819
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.

889
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,070
Whatever.

890
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,240
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to...

891
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,785
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.

892
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,378
Ooh.

893
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:08,082
I don't suppose I might...

894
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,302
Why, certainly,
Your Majesty. Allow me.

895
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:15,214
Sire, I must advise against this.

896
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,217
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

897
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,345
Ow, ow, ow.

898
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,555
Ahh! Whoa!

899
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,774
Look out, here I come.

900
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:31,439
Just where did you
say you were from?

901
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,319
Oh, much farther than
you've travelled, I'm sure.

902
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,073
- Try me.
- SULTAN: Look out, Polly.

903
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,408
Hey, watch it.

904
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,786
Watch it with the dumb rug.

905
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,834
Aah!

906
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,544
Whew!

907
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,631
Out of the way. I'm
coming in to land.

908
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:58,549
Jafar, watch this.

909
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,519
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.

910
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:05,848
Yes, I do seem to
have a knack for it.

911
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,309
This is a very impressive youth.

912
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,645
And a prince besides.

913
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:14,315
(WHISPERS) If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.

914
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,110
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.

915
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:21,781
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.

916
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,956
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure. Not!

917
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,162
SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one.

918
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,415
And I'm pretty sure I'll
like Princess Jasmine.

919
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:34,711
Your Highness, no. I must
intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

920
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,963
This boy is no different
from the others.

921
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,757
What makes him think he is
worthy of the princess?

922
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:43,094
Your Majesty, I am
Prince Ali Ababwa.

923
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:46,139
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

924
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,890
How dare you.

925
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,728
All of you. Standing
around deciding my future?

926
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,982
I am not a prize to be won.

927
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,366
Oh, dear.

928
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:02,530
Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just
give Jasmine time to cool down.

929
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:07,958
I think it's time to say
good-bye to Prince Abubu.

930
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,291
ALADDIN: (SIGHS)
What am I gonna do?

931
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,752
Jasmine won't even
let me talk to her.

932
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:19,848
I should've known I couldn't pull
off this stupid prince wish.

933
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,467
(GROWLING)

934
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,012
So move.

935
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,514
Hey.

936
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,183
That's a good move.

937
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:33,028
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.

938
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,729
Genie, I need help.

939
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,523
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

940
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,943
If you wanna court the little lady,
you gotta be a straight shooter.

941
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,446
- Do you got it?
- What?

942
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,948
(READING)

943
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,241
No way.

944
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:51,704
If Jasmine found out I was
really some crummy street rat,

945
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,955
she'd laugh at me.

946
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,925
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

947
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:01,172
Al, all joking aside, you
really ought to be yourself.

948
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,466
Hey, that's the last
thing I wanna be.

949
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,384
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

950
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:10,061
I just... I gotta be
smooth, cool, confident.

951
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,231
How do I look?

952
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,901
Like a prince.

953
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,081
(SIGHS)

954
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,670
- ALADDIN: Princess Jasmine?
- (GROWLING)

955
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,373
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

956
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:39,001
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

957
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,670
I do not want to see you.

958
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,047
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

959
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:46,301
- JASMINE: Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

960
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,937
So, how's our little beau doing?

961
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:52,348
- Good kitty, take off.
- (RAJAH GROWLING)

962
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,558
Down, kitty.

963
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:55,017
Wait. Wait.

964
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,270
Do I know you?

965
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:00,115
Uh, no. No.

966
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:04,402
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

967
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,863
The marketplace?

968
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,708
I have servants who go to
the marketplace for me.

969
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,953
Why, I even have servants who go
to the marketplace for my servants,

970
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,047
so it couldn't have
been me you met.

971
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:20,167
No. I guess not.

972
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,962
GENIE: Enough about you,
Casanova. Talk about her.

973
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,756
She's smart, fun,
the hair, the eyes.

974
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,341
Anything. Pick a feature.

975
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:30,344
Ahem. Uh, Princess
Jasmine? You're very...

976
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,138
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

977
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,514
- punctual.
- Punctual.

978
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,807
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

979
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,310
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

980
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,436
Hmm.

981
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,530
I'm rich, too, you know.

982
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,900
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

983
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,902
I know.

984
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:49,327
A fine prize for any
prince to marry.

985
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:52,241
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.

986
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,910
Warning! Warning!

987
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,505
Right. A prince like you.

988
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:00,416
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

989
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,635
Mayday! Mayday!

990
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,172
JASMINE:
Just go jump off a balcony!

991
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,424
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

992
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,301
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

993
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:14,180
Okay, fine. But remember,
"bee" yourself.

994
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,182
- Yeah, right.
- What?

995
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:19,186
Uh... Uh, you're right.

996
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:23,774
(SIGHS) You aren't just
some prize to be won.

997
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,535
You should be free to
make your own choice.

998
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:28,069
I'll go now.

999
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,529
- No!
- What? What?

1000
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,031
How...

1001
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,783
How are you doing that?

1002
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:37,208
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

1003
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,293
- (KISSES)
- You, uh...

1004
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,667
You don't want to go
for a ride, do you?

1005
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,670
We could get out of the
palace, see the world.

1006
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,469
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

1007
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,553
- What?
- Do you trust me?

1008
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,397
Yes.

1009
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:15,458

01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:44,970
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!

1385
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:52,355
All right, your wish is my
command. Way to go, Al.

1386
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,862
Yes.

1387
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,607
Yes!

1388
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,317
The power.

1389
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:06,903
- (JAFAR LAUGHS)
- (JASMINE COUGHS)

1390
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:11,949
The absolute power!

1391
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,794
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1392
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:20,541
The universe is mine to
command, to control!

1393
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:24,128
Not so fast, Jafar. Aren't
you forgetting something?

1394
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:27,465
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie, you got it.

1395
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:28,758
What?

1396
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:31,387
And everything that goes with it.

1397
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:34,806
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.

1398
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,808
ALADDIN:
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

1399
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:39,852
You're the genie. I don't want...

1400
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:41,646
Itty bitty living space.

1401
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:45,071
Al, you little genius, you.

1402
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:54,500
- Ahh!
- (MEOWS)

1403
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,833
JAFAR: Get your blasted
beak out of my face.

1404
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:05,503
- IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1405
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:06,754
Allow me.

1406
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:10,842
Ten thousand years in a Cave of
Wonders ought to chill him out.

1407
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,885
(IAGO YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

1408
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:15,559
JAFAR: Shut up!

1409
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:23,025
Jasmine...

1410
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,441
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1411
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,319
I know why you did.

1412
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:34,574
Well, I guess this is good-bye?

1413
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:38,045
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.

1414
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,330
I love you.

1415
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:45,042
(SNIFFLES) Al, no problem.
You've still got one wish left.

1416
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,211
Just say the word and
you're a prince again.

1417
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,380
But, Genie, what
about your freedom?

1418
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:52,592
Hey, it's only an
eternity of servitude.

1419
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,594
This is love.

1420
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:59,056
Al, you're not gonna find another
girl like her in a million years.

1421
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:01,730
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

1422
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,729
Jasmine, I do love you,

1423
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:08,575
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1424
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:10,861
I understand.

1425
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:15,072
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1426
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,909
One bona fide prince
pedigree coming up.

1427
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:21,584
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

1428
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:44,810
I'm free. I'm free.

1429
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:47,188
Quick. Quick. Wish for
something outrageous.

1430
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,565
Say, "I want the Nile."
Wish for the Nile. Try that.

1431
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,443
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!

1432
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:54,028
(LAUGHING GLEEFULLY)

1433
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,614
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1434
01:23:56,615 --> 01:24:00,076
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1435
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:03,797
I'm hittin' the road. I'm off
to see the world. I'm...

1436
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,881
Genie, I'm...

1437
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,467
I'm gonna miss you.

1438
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,141
Me, too, Al. (SNIFFLES)

1439
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,640
No matter what anybody says,

1440
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,194
you'll always be a prince to me.

1441
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,104
That's right.

1442
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:31,779
You've certainly proven your
worth as far as I'm concerned.

1443
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:34,944
It's that law that's the problem.

1444
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:38,197
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1445
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,907
From this day forth,

1446
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:44,870
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

1447
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:47,840
Him. I choose...

1448
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:51,677
I choose you, Aladdin.

1449
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:55,215
Call me Al.

1450
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:59,260
Oh, all of you, come over
here. Big group hug.

1451
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,053
Group hug.

1452
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,147
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1453
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,682
Ooh, hairball.

1454
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,310
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

1455
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:09,854
I'm outta here!

1456
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:12,356
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1457
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,109
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

1458
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,819
No, I'm mythology.

1459
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:20,244
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

1460

<i>(SINGING) A whole new world</i>

1461
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,289
