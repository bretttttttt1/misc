1
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,516
Don't worry. It's just a pack of wolves.
Come on, we're almost rid of it.

2
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,832
- Caleb, it's after me!
-Grab on!

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,251
Run! Run!

4
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,667
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.

5
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,211
Come on, help me bury it.

6
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,515
What if someone digs it up?

7
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,556
May God have mercy on his soul.

8
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,715
- Hi, Alan.
-Hi, Miss Magruder.

9
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,431
- Afternoon, Alan.
-Hey, Frank.

10
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,066
- All yours, Alan.
-Thanks, Bill.

11
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,915
Get him!

12
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,716
Prepare to die, Parrish!

13
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,765
Hey, Parrish, what's the rush?

14
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,440
He's going to his dad's factory!

15
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,363
He's going to Daddy now.

16
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,787
Go on, Parrish! Run to Daddy.

17
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,045
We'll be waiting.

18
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,938
Hey, Carl.

19
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,776
Hey, Alan, my man. I gotta
show you something. Come here.

20
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,191
Now, I've been working on this
for almost a year.

21
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,655
And I got an appointment
with your father...

22
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,072
...to show him this.
Go ahead, take it.

23
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,167
So, what do you think?
You think he'll like it?

24
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,582
What is it?

25
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:09,171
What is it? This is the future. If I can get
Wilt Chamberlain to wear them...

26
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,711
...there will be a pair of those
in every closet in America.

27
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,926
That's gonna be the height of fashion.

28
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,051
What's wrong?

29
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,934
- Nothing.
-Alan!

30
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,520
Thanks, Bob. What are you doing here?

31
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,903
I've told you, this factory isn't
a playground. It's dangerous.

32
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,696
Dad, can I have a ride home?

33
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,406
Oh, Alan.

34
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,444
Is Billy Jessup picking on you again?

35
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,282
Son, you're gonna have
to face him sooner or later.

36
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:46,253
Look, if you're afraid of something,
you've got to stand and face it.

37
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,879
Now, run on, son.

38
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,422
Carl, you know better
than to let the boy play in here.

39
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,257
Sorry, sir.

40
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,881
Oh, what was it
you wanted to show me?

41
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,890
Just a minute, sir.

42
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,018
What the devil--?

43
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,234
Get an extinguisher.
Bring it over here.

44
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,032
What is that?

45
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,497
Who did this?

46
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,706
Well?

47
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,003
I did, sir.

48
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,480
Being a Parrish doesn't mean
you can hang around with my girlfriend.

49
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,444
We're just friends.

50
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,108
Not anymore.

51
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,361
Get him!

52
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,154
- Let's go.
-Okay, I've got his bike!

53
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,120
Jerks!

54
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,459
Neat.

55
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,971
Alan?

56
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,595
Are you home?

57
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:20,311
Oh, Alan, not again. Come on.

58
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,198
Hard work, determination,
cheerful outlook...

59
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,826
...attributes that have exemplified
the Brantford spirit...

60
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,740
...since our forefathers
first settled this town.

61
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:37,161
Despite the harshness of our native clime
and the granite of our soil...

62
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,954
...we have...

63
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,170
- Prospered.
-I knew the whole thing this morning.

64
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,460
You'll know the whole darn thing tonight.

65
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,676
- Right. Let's go.
-Sam, we have to talk to Alan.

66
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,856
Well, we're on our way.

67
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,140
Okay.

68
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,528
I told your father what you told me this
afternoon, that it wasn't just Billy Jessup.

69
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,987
- Look, if I'd known that, I wouldn't have--
-It's okay, Dad.

70
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,117
But I'm proud of you.

71
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,079
You faced them,
even though you were outnumbered.

72
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:18,039
And, since you took it like a man,
your mother and I have decided...

73
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,375
...that you're ready to go
to the Cliffside School for Boys.

74
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,041
- There.
-Congratulations, sweetheart.

75
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,757
You don't want me living here anymore?

76
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,388
Alan.

77
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,718
It's always been the plan
that you'd go to Cliffside.

78
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,104
I mean, Parrishes have been going
to Cliffside ever since the 1700s.

79
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,265
Even your Uncle Skylar went there.

80
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,150
Look at this. Parrish Hall?

81
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,902
It's the main dormitory.

82
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,445
This is great. Kids are on my case here
because I'm a Parrish.

83
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,114
Just wait till I'm living
in a building named after me.

84
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,625
It was named after my father.

85
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,081
Good. Why don't you live in it?

86
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:05,249
I did. I wouldn't be who I am today
if it weren't for my years there.

87
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,635
Maybe I don't want to be who you are.

88
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,636
Maybe I don't even want
to be a Parrish.

89
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,930
You won't be.
Not till you start acting like one.

90
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,140
- Sam--
-Get your coat.

91
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,776
I guess I'm not ready for Cliffside, then.

92
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,565
We're taking you there next Sunday!
And I don't want to hear another word!

93
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,948
You won't!

94
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,986
I'm never talking to you again!

95
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,326
- Sam...
-Don't.

96
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,836
- Sam.
-What?

97
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,292
Nothing. Just--

98
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,403
What are you doing here?

99
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,989
I brought your bike back.

100
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,825
You didn't have to.

101
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,081
I was going over
to Billy's to get it myself.

102
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,334
I told Billy to stop picking on you.

103
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:28,044
You shouldn't have wasted your breath.
We gotta talk about this some other time.

104
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,341
What was that?

105
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,012
- You heard it too?
-Of course I heard it.

106
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,510
Come on. I found
this really weird game in the factory.

107
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,519
A game?

108
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,533
"Jumanji.

109
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:04,209
A game for those who seek to find
a way to leave their world behind.

110
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,004
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles gets another turn.

111
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,211
The first player to reach the end wins."
You wanna play?

112
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,053
I quit playing board games
five years ago.

113
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,220
Sarah!

114
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,399
It's gotta be magnetized or something.

115
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,813
Alan, look.

116
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,653
"At night they fly, you better run.

117
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:40,237
These winged things are not much fun."

118
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,748
What was that?

119
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,087
I don't know.

120
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,083
- Put it away, Alan.
-Okay.

121
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,849
Oh, no.

122
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,601
The game thinks I rolled.

123
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,763
What do you mean, "the game thinks"?

124
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,772
"In the jungle you must wait...

125
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,234
...until the dice read five or eight."

126
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,660
"ln the jungle you must wait"?
What does that mean?

127
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,549
Sarah!

128
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,215
Roll the dice!

129
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,180
Sarah!

130
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,007
I think a bed-and-breakfast is just
what this town needs.

131
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,928
Well, it was pretty hard to pass up.
Especially full of furniture.

132
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,311
Oh, boy.

133
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,098
I keep forgetting
how big this place is.

134
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,814
Judy, Peter, come look at this.

135
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,025
I'm gonna put a reception area
right over here.

136
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,524
And a bar over here in the parlor.

137
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,159
That sounds lovely.

138
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,074
I'm sure you and your kids
are gonna be very happy here.

139
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,039
Well...

140
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,704
Actually, they're my late brother's.

141
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,715
He and his wife passed away
just last winter.

142
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,554
Is this something, or what?

143
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,890
It sure is.

144
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,075
So, what do you think, young man?
ls it big enough for you?

145
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,132
Peter hasn't spoken a word
since it happened.

146
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,627
Oh, my.

147
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,922
I'm so sorry. How terribly awful.

148
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,345
It's okay.

149
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,141
We barely even knew our parents.
They were always away.

150
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,523
Skiing in St. Moritz,
gambling in Monte Carlo...

151
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,356
...safariing in darkest Africa.

152
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,443
We didn't even know if they loved us.

153
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,029
But when the sheik's yacht went down...

154
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,945
...they managed to write us
a beautiful goodbye note...

155
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,241
...that was found floating in
a champagne bottle amongst the debris.

156
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,208
Excuse me.

157
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,971
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.

158
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,303
- So you'll send me those escrow papers?
-First thing tomorrow.

159
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,085
I'll have to get a locksmith out
for this one.

160
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,175
Peter, pick up your toys, please.

161
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,897
Peter, take this suitcase up to the attic.

162
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,776
Then we can all have ice cream.
And bourbon.

163
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,800
What? What is it?

164
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,387
I'm going to Motel 6.

165
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,768
Oh, for heaven's sake.

166
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,338
I don't see any guano.

167
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,010
He said it looked like that.

168
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:35,092
That's an African bat. Some kid said
she saw some back in the '60s...

169
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,603
...but we don't get bats
like that in New England.

170
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,933
That's what he saw.

171
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,442
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.

172
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,318
Bats aren't what I'd worry about
in this house, anyways.

173
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,107
What would you worry about?

174
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,071
Well, personally...

175
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,864
...l wouldn't wanna live in a house
where someone was murdered.

176
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,291
- Murdered?
-Yep.

177
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,498
Little Alan Parrish.
I say his father did it.

178
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:09,084
There's 1001 places he could've hid
the body in this house.

179
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,341
Especially if he chopped it up first.

180
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,547
Hey up there!

181
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,059
You kids don't wanna be late
for your first day of school.

182
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,523
- Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
-Do you hear that?

183
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,653
There is nothing to be afraid of
in this house.

184
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,178
I can't believe I have to see
your principal after the first day.

185
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,933
What am I gonna do?

186
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,438
Now, let's just try to relax
and finish dinner.

187
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,020
Talk about something else.

188
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,523
We found out why you got
this house so cheap.

189
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,815
Twenty-six years ago, a kid named
Alan Parrish used to live here.

190
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,443
Then one day, he just disappeared.

191
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,537
Because his parents chopped him up
in little pieces and hid him in the walls.

192
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,542
Okay, that's it. I am sick and tired
of your lies, young lady. You're grounded.

193
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,633
Fine, there's nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway.

194
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,762
But just for your information,
that wasn't a lie.

195
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,462
Did you hear anything a little while ago?

196
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,173
Do you miss Mom and Dad?

197
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,226
No.

198
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,761
Liar.

199
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,432
If you don't cut that out,
they'll send you to a shrink.

200
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,274
Where do you think they're gonna
send you if you don't start talking?

201
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,915
If I get held up at the permit office, I'll call.

202
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,630
The school bus should be here
any minute.

203
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,305
You guys still have your house keys?

204
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,384
Are you guys listening to me?

205
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,265
Hello?

206
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:09,980
Hello?

207
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,391
What?

208
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,523
Maybe I should wait with you
till the bus comes.

209
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,860
Did your parents used
to put you on the bus?

210
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,199
No-- No.

211
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,031
Are you sure?

212
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,162
I could drop you off.

213
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,246
No, don't worry about us.
The bus will be here any minute.

214
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,250
Okay. Please be good today.

215
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,174
You do hear it.

216
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,516
Hear what?

217
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,534
Where's it coming from?

218
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,852
Let's bring it over here.

219
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,250
Weird. They're stuck.

220
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,337
"Jumanji, a game for those
who seek to find...

221
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,463
...a way to leave their world behind.

222
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,341
Roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles get another turn.

223
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,594
The first player to reach the end wins."

224
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,769
It's gotta be microchips or something.

225
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,603
You go first.

226
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,568
Okay.

227
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,357
Six.

228
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,632
"A tiny bite can make you itch,
make you sneeze, make you twitch."

229
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,917
Don't!

230
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,504
"This will not be an easy mission.

231
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,264
Monkeys slow the expedition."

232
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,349
What is that?

233
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,063
I bet those monkeys came
from the game.

234
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,224
The mosquitoes too.

235
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,900
I didn't see this part.

236
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,156
"Adventurers, beware."

237
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:43,421
"Adventurers, beware. Do not begin
unless you intend to finish.

238
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,673
The exciting consequences
of the game...

239
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:49,426
...will vanish only when a player has
reached Jumanji and called out its name."

240
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,758
- The monkeys are gone.
-Good.

241
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,922
- Put it away.
-Wait!

242
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,592
If we finish the game, it'll all go away.

243
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,056
We'd better do it,
or Aunt Nora will pitch a fit.

244
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,474
We should just get through it quickly.
I mean, there's no skill involved.

245
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,361
No, you rolled doubles.

246
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,237
You get another turn.

247
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,943
Roll.

248
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,279
Five.

249
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:20,833
"His fangs are sharp.
He likes your taste.

250
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:25,337
Your party better move posthaste."

251
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,048
I don't like the sound of that.

252
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,010
Judy, someone's in here.

253
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,653
It's not real, Peter. It's a hallucination.

254
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,495
Run, Peter!

255
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,006
I'm back.

256
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,018
My bike.

257
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,650
Somebody roll a five or an eight?

258
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,903
He did.

259
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,906
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

260
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,791
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

261
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,997
Thank you.

262
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,129
Sorry if I scared you.
Sorry if I scared you.

263
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,334
Thank you.

264
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,999
I'm back!

265
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,509
Mom! Dad!

266
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,839
I'm home!

267
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,428
I'm back!

268
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,687
It's me! It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad!

269
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,646
I'm home! I'm back!

270
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,189
Are you my little sister?

271
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,229
No.

272
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,194
I'm Judy and he's Peter.

273
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,859
Where's Mom? ls Dad at the factory?

274
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,574
Are you...

275
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,701
...Alan Parrish?

276
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,868
Yeah. Who are you?

277
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,877
We live here now.

278
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,043
Where's my mom and dad?

279
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,041
We don't know.

280
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,299
This house has been empty for years.

281
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,302
Everyone thought you were dead.

282
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,647
Sorry.

283
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,069
<i>--Said they're about 2 feet tall,
red fur, long tail.</i>

284
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,985
- Give me that description again.
<i>- Red</i> fur and long <i>tail.</i>

285
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:22,092
Get down off of my car, please,
and get up on the sidewalk.

286
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,093
- What year is it?
-It was brand-new.

287
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:32,512
- No. What year is it?
-1995, remember?

288
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,645
- Ninety-five...
-You got some ID?

289
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,933
Let me guess,
it's in your other Tarzan outfit, right?

290
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,943
- Twenty-six years.
-Are you from around here?

291
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,649
I was.

292
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,314
But I've been in Jumanji.

293
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,200
Indonesia. He was in the Peace Corps.

294
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,753
- Carl Bentley, the Sole Man.
-ls this man related to you?

295
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,791
- Yes, sir, he's our uncle.
-Does he always dress like that?

296
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,801
Well, yeah, he's a vegetarian.

297
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,011
Get out of there!

298
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,638
Monkeys. Monkeys.

299
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,311
Is he all right upstairs?

300
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,524
He suffered a head injury
a few months ago.

301
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,996
Don't you move!

302
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,578
Thief! Hey!

303
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,667
- Stop! Stop!
-Don't move, don't move.

304
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,173
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?

305
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,755
To find my parents!

306
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,425
Come on.

307
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,619
Wait!

308
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,927
My dad used to make shoes here.

309
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,514
They were the best shoes
in New England.

310
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,182
Hey!

311
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,114
Sorry.

312
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,111
Easy, girl.

313
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,785
Do you know what happened
to the shoe factory?

314
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:48,332
Yeah, it folded up.
Like everything else in this town.

315
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,169
It's pretty cold out there.
How about some coffee?

316
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,514
Why would they close Parrish Shoes?

317
00:36:56,256 --> 00:37:00,727
When his kid ran away, Sam put
everything he had into trying to find him.

318
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,853
His time, his money...

319
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,514
Everything.

320
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,151
After a while, he stopped coming to work.

321
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,520
He just quit caring.

322
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:15,905
I don't think anybody loved his boy
more than Sam did.

323
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,946
Here.

324
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,534
You're gonna freeze out there.

325
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,839
Thank you.
Are the Parrishes still around?

326
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,835
- I see them now and then.
-Yeah?

327
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,595
They're over on Adams Street.

328
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,820
Our parents are dead too.

329
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,455
They were in the Middle East
negotiating peace when--

330
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,252
Our dad was in advertising.

331
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,218
Bet you miss him, huh?

332
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,387
Me too.

333
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,643
There he goes again.

334
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:29,604
Listen, I know you're upset and all,
but we should finish the game.

335
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,985
We? Why do you need me?

336
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,113
Well, just in case
any other scary stuff comes out.

337
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,899
Plus there's a lion in my aunt's bedroom.

338
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,909
Do I look like a Ringling Brother?

339
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,699
She'll be home soon.

340
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,582
Won't she be surprised?
I hope she's not allergic to cats.

341
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,508
Larry, we need the wheels.
Give me a hand.

342
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,643
- Did we hit her that hard?
-No, it looks like another weird bite.

343
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:19,825
- Yeah, it's another one, all right.
-Jeez, over 50. What the hell's going on?

344
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,867
- Easy, now. Easy.
-Hey, look.

345
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,120
-Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
-Who's that?

346
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,407
- The Realtor.
-Quiet.

347
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,995
Listen.

348
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,746
You hear that?

349
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,627
Hear what?

350
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,796
Get in the car.

351
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:43,382
Okay, think. What came out
of the game before me?

352
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,927
There was a lion,
a bunch of monkeys and...

353
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,595
That!

354
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:55,228
It's okay, it's okay.
It's just a bug, but we're safe in here.

355
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,145
See? We're fine.

356
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,198
As long as we stay low,
he can't get through there too far, okay?

357
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,908
Don't you worry. We're fine.

358
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,199
Okay. He can't get us in here.
He can't get through the glass.

359
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,535
We're safe.

360
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,373
Either one of you know how to drive?

361
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,504
No? Well, that's no problem.

362
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,879
My dad used to let me
back the car down the driveway.

363
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,592
Once.

364
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,348
So, what's the big deal?

365
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,179
- Buckle up.
-Here we go!

366
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,349
Wait a minute. What? Wait.

367
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,443
Alan, the top!

368
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,671
Piece of cake.

369
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,882
Yeah.

370
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,436
Alan.

371
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,985
Keep that thing away from me!

372
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,239
When are you gonna help us play?

373
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,121
We've gotta hurry.
Our aunt's gonna be home soon.

374
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:34,455
Well, good. You can inform her
that she's the ex-owner of this house.

375
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:39,589
I hope you realize, with my parents gone,
this home belongs to me.

376
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,840
Oh, thank you.

377
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,756
No more banana leaves.

378
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,969
Yes.

379
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:58,353
What do you think those monkeys
are gonna do to the ecosystem?

380
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,728
Hello?

381
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,554
What happened to you?
You shave with a piece of glass?

382
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,099
What happened to you?
The Clampetts have a yard sale?

383
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,809
What do you want?
I've never shaved before.

384
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:43,816
Where are you going?

385
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:48,905
How about Peter and I play,
and you just sort of watch?

386
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,489
Thanks, I've seen it.

387
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,660
So if you're not gonna help us,
what are you gonna do?

388
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,292
I don't know.
Pretty much take up where I left off.

389
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,500
I wonder if Mrs. Niedermeyer's
still teaching sixth grade.

390
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,846
Come on, Judy, he's not gonna help us.
He's afraid.

391
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,765
What did you say?

392
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,853
You're afraid. It's okay to be afraid.

393
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,855
Let's go set it up in the living room.

394
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,702
You have no idea
what you're getting yourself into.

395
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,205
Whatever it is, we'll handle it
by ourselves. We don't need your help.

396
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,038
I don't think so.

397
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,625
You think monkeys,
mosquitoes and lions are bad?

398
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,756
That's just the beginning.

399
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,174
I've seen things you've only seen
in your nightmares.

400
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,219
Things you can't even imagine.

401
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,434
Things you can't even see.

402
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,764
There are things
that hunt you in the night.

403
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:05,231
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eating.

404
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,943
And you hope to God
that you're not dessert.

405
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,649
Afraid?

406
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,945
You don't even know what afraid is.

407
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:18,081
You will not last five minutes without me.

408
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,366
So---...

409
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,998
...you're gonna help us?

410
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,294
I'll watch...

411
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,463
...but I'm not afraid.

412
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,359
Peter, that was very cool.

413
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,943
It's reverse psychology.
Dad used to pull it on me all the time.

414
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,195
Ready?

415
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,117
Yeah.

416
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,495
Alan, ready?

417
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,655
There is no "ready."

418
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,715
I'll try it again.

419
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,222
Alan, it's not working.

420
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,654
Oh, no.

421
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,155
It's not your turn.

422
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,818
Yeah, I rolled first. Then Peter twice
because he got doubles.

423
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,236
Now it's my turn again.

424
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:43,158
No, look.
Two of those pieces are yours, right?

425
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,667
Who's the other pieces?

426
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,957
The elephant was mine.

427
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:56,342
You're playing the game
I started in 1969.

428
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,057
I'm gonna have to play.

429
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,222
It's not my turn.

430
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,016
Whose turn is it?

431
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,360
Sarah Whittle.

432
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,124
This is where she used to live.

433
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,711
This place gives me the creeps.

434
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,096
We used to play on this porch.

435
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,895
I knew she still wouldn't live here.

436
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,603
Probably married Billy Jessup
and living in a trailer park.

437
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,267
- Come on.
-Let's at least ask.

438
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:55,564
- Maybe she'll know where Sarah went.
-Of course she'll know. She's a psychic.

439
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,323
Good point.

440
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,403
I remember the porch being a lot bigger.

441
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,117
Hello?

442
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,917
- Can you help us?
-Do you have an appointment?

443
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:12,251
- No, we're just trying to find someone.
-Madam Serena can't see anyone now.

444
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,586
Well, maybe you can help us.

445
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,757
What is it?

446
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,139
We're looking for someone
who used to live here.

447
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,801
No, I've lived here my whole life.

448
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,345
Well, then you must know Sarah Whittle.

449
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,311
What do you want with Sarah Whittle?

450
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,484
Sarah?

451
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,734
No, I don't go by that name anymore.

452
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,779
Sarah Whittle?

453
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,035
What do you want?

454
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:53,792
Twenty-six years ago, you played a game
with a little boy down the street.

455
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,126
A game with drums.

456
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,014
How do you know that?

457
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,557
I was that little boy, Sarah.

458
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,307
Alan?

459
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,491
You killed her.

460
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,449
<i>Leave a message
and the doctor will call you back...</i>

461
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,990
<i>...at his earliest convenience.</i>

462
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:33,836
Dr. Boorstein, it's Sarah Whittle. Listen,
if you could call me as soon as you can.

463
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,838
I think I need to have
my dosage checked.

464
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,672
That event we've been discussing,
the one that didn't really happen?

465
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,088
Oh, boy.
I'm having an episode here today...

466
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,848
...with the little boy
that didn't really disappear.

467
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,850
I'm sitting in his living room,
drinking lemonade.

468
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,479
If you could call me, I'd really be
interested in your interpretation.

469
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,265
Thank you so much.

470
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,185
- He'll call me back.
-While we're waiting...

471
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,904
- God! No, no, no!
-Sarah. Sarah.

472
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,235
- Oh, no, no, no.
-It's okay. Sarah. Please.

473
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:06,278
I have spent over 2000 hours in therapy
convincing myself that that doesn't exist.

474
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,072
What happened to you was so awful,
I made up this thing--

475
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,536
Sarah, it was awful. It was awful.

476
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,121
It was awful, it really was.

477
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,712
But it was real. Real.

478
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:21,047
No, no, it wasn't real, Alan. Your father
murdered you, and he chopped you up.

479
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,506
Sarah, come on.

480
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,888
My dad did that?

481
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,517
My father could barely hug me...

482
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,599
...let alone cut me into little pieces.

483
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:38,059
Twenty-six years ago,
we started playing a little game.

484
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,522
And now...

485
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,156
...we're all gonna sit down
and we're gonna finish it.

486
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,192
And guess what.

487
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,031
It's your turn.

488
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,750
No.

489
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,668
Here.

490
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,914
Play the game, Sarah.

491
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,921
- Oh, no, no.
-Fine.

492
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,840
Just give me the dice and you can
go home. You don't have to play.

493
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,758
Thank you, Alan.

494
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,641
Oh, my God! How could you do that?

495
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,940
It's the law of the jungle, Sarah.
You'll get used to it.

496
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:22,194
When I think of all the energy I spent
visualizing you as a radiant spirit--

497
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,946
Go on, read it.

498
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,612
"They grow much faster than bamboo.

499
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,615
Take care or they'll come after you."

500
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,535
Oh, great.

501
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,506
Oh, God. Tell me this isn't happening.

502
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:46,044
Oh, it is. Stay away from the walls.
Don't touch anything.

503
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,301
No quick movements.

504
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,014
- They're beautiful.
-Oh, yeah, they're beautiful.

505
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,309
Don't touch the purple ones.
They shoot poisonous barbs.

506
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:05,692
And definitely stay away from the pods.
The big yellow ones.

507
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,398
What big yellow ones?

508
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,370
Peter!

509
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,372
I got you! Get his arms!

510
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,659
Get it off me! Get it off me!

511
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,380
Oh, my God!

512
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,641
- Hang on, boy.
-Got him? I'll be right back.

513
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,350
Oh, my God.

514
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,516
Sorry, Angus.

515
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:47,901
Harvest time!

516
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,664
Are you okay?

517
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,245
Peter.

518
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,545
Oh, my God!

519
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:12,263
My car. Oh, my car.

520
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,547
<i>Carl, come in, please.</i>

521
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,134
<i>Come in, please, Carl.
Has anybody seen Carl?</i>

522
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,430
I can't believe this.
Start, start, please. Yes!

523
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,896
- Carl? Come in, Carl.
-Carl here.

524
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:27,688
<i>Where in heaven's name have you been?
We've got an Animal Control situation.</i>

525
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,196
Get Stan and Willy on it.

526
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:33,576
I'm heading over to the old Parrish place
to check out a suspicious character.

527
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,662
I should've been a fireman.

528
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,750
Yeah.

529
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,210
Sarah!

530
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,756
Get your hands off me!

531
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,763
- The game is not over yet, Sarah.
-Well, it is for me.

532
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,765
You are not in the jungle anymore.

533
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,224
Stop this! You don't treat people like this.

534
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,106
Okay.

535
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,786
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.

536
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,954
Alan, please, last time I played
this game it ruined my life.

537
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,174
- It ruined your life?
-Yes.

538
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:36,134
"In the jungle you must wait
till the dice read five or eight."

539
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,308
I was a little girl, Alan.

540
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,510
You disappeared.

541
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:47,483
And a bunch of bats surrounded me
and chased me down the street.

542
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,481
I was afraid.

543
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,646
I'm sorry, Alan.

544
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,482
No one believed me. I was all alone.

545
00:53:55,649 --> 00:54:00,496
So was I, for 26 years, Sarah.

546
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,832
Me too.

547
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:08,917
It's okay, Sarah. We're scared too.

548
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,382
But if we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

549
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,132
What if I get stuck in the game?

550
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,921
You won't.

551
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,720
Because I won't stop playing.

552
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,351
And neither will I.

553
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,637
I won't either.

554
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,987
Come on, Sarah.

555
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,363
Please?

556
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,041
I knew this was gonna be a bad day.

557
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,128
Hey, come on, we're gonna be fine.

558
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,381
We just have to keep our heads.

559
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,085
And roll with the punches.

560
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:19,067
"A hunter from the darkest wild...

561
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,283
...makes you feel just like a child."

562
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,076
What is it?

563
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,708
Van Pelt.

564
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:38,090
You miserable coward!
Come back and face me like a man.

565
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,600
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.

566
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,019
Coming, ready or not.

567
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,790
Hey, you!

568
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,667
Drop your gun
and get your hands in the air!

569
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,328
Man, I don't believe this.

570
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,339
So even if Alan gets out of this situation...

571
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,920
...same kind of thing will happen
over and over again.

572
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:04,840
When you carry around repressed anger,
it attracts a lot of negative energy...

573
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:08,930
...and things happen, like ending up
in the jungle. That was no accident.

574
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,344
There are no accidents.

575
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,602
Whose turn is it?

576
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,270
-It's my turn.
-Really? Great.

577
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,185
You might've told us
there was a man that hunts people.

578
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,196
Well, I didn't know, okay?
It's just the roll of the dice.

579
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:24,279
Is he the reason you didn't wanna play?

580
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,157
You didn't wanna play either?

581
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,370
Mr. We-Started-Something-26-Years-
Ago-and-Now-We-Gotta-Finish-It?

582
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,419
What's with this guy?

583
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:41,084
He's a hunter. He kills things. That's what
he does. Right now, he wants to kill me.

584
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,592
- Why you?
-Why me?

585
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:46,722
I don't know. You'd think
it'd be a waste of his time.

586
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,757
Maybe he needs something for his wall.

587
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,392
- A Parrish.
-lt's your turn.

588
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,554
Have you ever talked with him
about your differences?

589
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:59,022
- Are you crazy? The man has a gun--
-Don't ever call me crazy, Alan! Ever.

590
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:03,155
Everyone's called me crazy ever since
I said you were sucked into a game.

591
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,571
- Maybe I should roll.
-Yeah.

592
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,656
I was the girl who saw you murdered.

593
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,242
Do you think anybody showed up
at my birthday party?

594
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,659
- Hello, I'm rolling now. I'm gonna roll.
-Billy who?

595
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:18,917
What are you, an owl? Come on, Madam
Serena, dig into your consciousness.

596
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,752
- Here, just roll.
-Find the memory...

597
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,632
...of your old boyfriend Billy.

598
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:26,796
- The little kid who'd steal your bicycle?
-The big kid who took you to the movies.

599
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:31,308
"Don't be fooled, it isn't thunder.
Staying put would be a blunder."

600
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,139
- No, you're immature. No--
-You are.

601
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,851
- I know you are, but what am I?
-You are. I don't have to fall for this.

602
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,607
Do you feel that?

603
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,133
Run.

604
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,761
It's a stampede!

605
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,547
- Come on.
-The game!

606
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:17,971
Don't look back!

607
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,255
Not the game!

608
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,054
Why didn't you grab the game, Peter?

609
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,893
Just ignore him, honey. He's a Libra.

610
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,683
- Where are you going?
-He'll head for water!

611
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,442
Here we go. Come on.

612
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,022
<i>- Hello?
-It's Aunt Nora. Where have you been?</i>

613
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,237
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
You have the wrong number.

614
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,283
Wait for me!

615
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,884
- What can I do for you?
-l'll have a gross of these.

616
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,429
You know, they stopped
making these in 1903.

617
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:44,225
Damn. Then I shall need
a replacement weapon.

618
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,813
Well, there's a waiting period.

619
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:50,068
And you'll have to fill out these.

620
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,197
Or I could fill these out.

621
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,952
Louise.

622
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,412
Now, anyone asks,
you didn't get this here.

623
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,502
You're not a postal worker, are you?

624
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,931
Alan!

625
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,427
Quiet.

626
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,440
Okay.

627
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,283
Here, boy.

628
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,329
No!

629
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,458
- Peter!
-Peter!

630
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,616
- Peter, are you okay?
-That was great!

631
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,244
I can't believe you did that.
That was so cool.

632
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,873
- You gave me chills. Oh, my God.
-It was great.

633
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,371
Alan.

634
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,871
It's nice work.
Come on, give me the game. Let's go.

635
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,815
Oh, no.

636
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,731
Act natural.

637
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,732
Hey!

638
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,947
Hide the game.

639
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:48,913
I don't believe this.
Every time there's trouble, I run into you.

640
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,662
Me? I don't know
what you're talking about.

641
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,752
- All right. I'm taking you in.
-l'm not going anywhere.

642
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,924
Just--

643
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,797
All right.

644
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,756
Just a second. You can't take him, he's--

645
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,516
- Her fiancé.
-Wait. You said, he's your uncle.

646
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,763
It's all right. I'll be back soon.

647
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,442
Blast.

648
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,272
Remember, you said
you'd never abandon your friends.

649
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:21,157
- We'll finish the game later. Okay?
-Later?

650
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,660
Van Pelt. Van Pelt.

651
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,863
I suggest you all go home now.

652
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,452
Okay.

653
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:36,130
Now how are we supposed
to finish the game?

654
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,042
We can't.
We can't finish it without him.

655
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,301
Judy!

656
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:42,637
What?

657
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,178
What happened?

658
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:49,470
I thought I could end the game myself.
I was only 10 spaces away.

659
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:52,306
"A law of Jumanji having been broken...

660
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,691
...you will slip back
even more than your token."

661
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,519
You tried to cheat?

662
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,814
No, I tried to drop the dice
so they'd land on 12.

663
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,199
Oh, okay, honey.
Well, that would be cheating.

664
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,662
Peter, your hands! Look at your hands!

665
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:38,443
<i>Come in, this is Willy.
They cleaned out Larry's Hardware.</i>

666
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,322
<i>I can't stop them.
Get the National Guard down here now.</i>

667
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,108
All right. What is this about?
I know you know.

668
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:49,037
Yes, I do. But you wouldn't
believe me even if I told you, Carl.

669
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,574
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?

670
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,538
I know a lot more than that.

671
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,625
I know you used to work
on the stamping line at Parrish Shoes.

672
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,085
They used to call you Sole Man.

673
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,421
Sole Man, yeah, that's right.

674
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,679
I was in there too, man,
till old man Parrish fired me.

675
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,010
- He fired you?
-Yeah, man.

676
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:11,598
And I had something, I could've turned
this whole town around.

677
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,057
- Your shoes.
-Right.

678
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,397
Listen, Carl?

679
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,234
I know it doesn't mean much
after 26 years...

680
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,236
...but I'm sorry.

681
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,738
I'm sorry.

682
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,821
Sorry for what?

683
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,572
It's me, Alan.

684
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,249
Thank you. Come on.

685
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,455
What's going on?

686
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,997
Well, apparently, there's a sale, honey.

687
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,845
You just saw three monkeys
on a motorcycle, didn't you?

688
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,597
- Yes.
-Good girl. Come on.

689
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:54,261
Well, maybe we can bail him out
with a check.

690
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,020
Thank you.

691
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,932
You tell that sniveling coward from me,
if he wants--

692
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,405
Boy!

693
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,284
Get out of my way!

694
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,656
Hey, kid! What are you doing?

695
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,670
- Give me that, boy!
-No!

696
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,089
Hey!

697
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,171
- Peter!
-Help me!

698
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,843
Get me out of here!

699
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,677
- It's all right.
-Oh, my God, Peter. Come on.

700
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,520
All right.

701
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,375
- There it is.
-Wait here.

702
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,889
Gotcha, girlie.

703
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:56,762
No.

704
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,473
When Alan hears of your predicament,
he'll come.

705
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:03,266
He doesn't even know I'm here.
It won't work. Your plan's ruined.

706
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,732
- Don't move or I'll blow your brains out!
-Okay.

707
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,647
- Okay.
-Call the cops!

708
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,736
- That should do the trick.
-Oh, yeah.

709
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,244
Price check!

710
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,963
If you let me go, I can stop all this.

711
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,300
<i>It sounds</i> like <i>The Twilight Zone,
but it's true.</i>

712
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,219
Please, you gotta help me on this.

713
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:36,052
I know I'm gonna regret this.

714
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:39,184
All right. Just hold still.

715
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,096
- Okay.
-There, I let you go.

716
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,606
Now what are we gonna do? Hey.

717
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,438
- You are gonna stay here.
-My keys!

718
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,102
It's for your own good. Stay there.

719
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:52,568
- My handcuff keys. Wait!
-This is something I have to do!

720
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,732
- Alan!
-You'll thank me someday.

721
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,116
<i>Come in, Carl, code red.</i>

722
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,529
<i>Hostage situation at Sir Sav-a-lot.
A woman and two children.</i>

723
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:03,121
<i>Sounds like the armed perpetrator
in the pith helmet you reported.</i>

724
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:05,455
<i>Carl? Come in, Carl.</i>

725
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,541
- Lorraine? Come in.
-What's Sir Sav-a-lot?

726
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,456
-It's a discount store.
-Move over.

727
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:13,252
- Wait, wait, wait. Gently, gently.
-Okay. All right, all right.

728
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:15,136
Don't worry, I've done this before.

729
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,967
Once.

730
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,784
Where's Sir Sav-a-lot?

731
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,790
- Monroe and Elm.
-The Episcopal church.

732
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,202
It's not the church anymore.
It's a Speedy Burger.

733
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:51,168
Or at least it was. I don't know
what's left of it. People are going loopy.

734
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,207
Judy!

735
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:05,678
We got company.

736
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,598
No. It's all right. That's a traffic cop.
He'll back us up.

737
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,407
- Here's the game.
-Come on. Get out of here.

738
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,869
Rats.

739
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:34,609
- Turn the siren off. Right there! Okay.
-Okay, I got it.

740
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:44,452
Stop your cringing, woman.
I could have shot you at any moment.

741
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,827
Then why didn't you?

742
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:48,615
You didn't roll the dice, Alan did.

743
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,954
There it is, there it is. Hit the brakes.

744
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:54,337
- Hit the brakes!
-l'm hitting them. I'm hitting the brakes!

745
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:57,715
- Hit the brakes!
-The brakes! I am hitting the brakes!

746
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,296
He should be here any moment.

747
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,773
Sarah!

748
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,325
- Are you all right?
-Yes.

749
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,696
- Where's Peter?
-l'm here.

750
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,574
Oh, great.

751
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:39,549
<i>So remember, circumstances are
never, ever out of your control.</i>

752
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,509
<i>End of tape three.</i>

753
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:47,048
<i>Update on the extraordinary events
unfolding in Brantford, New Hampshire.</i>

754
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:50,058
<i>Ninety-eight people have been
hospitalized with symptoms...</i>

755
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,938
<i>...ranging from inexplicable fevers
and rashes to violent seizures.</i>

756
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,724
<i>Local resources have been strained
to the breaking point.</i>

757
01:13:56,891 --> 01:14:02,864
<i>And state health officials are now asking
those with such symptoms to dial 911.</i>

758
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,827
I got it.

759
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:54,407
Alan, talk to him. Please?

760
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,826
What? We don't have time for this, okay?

761
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:00,088
I know, but he's a kid
and he was trying to help.

762
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:02,748
- All right, come on.
-Thank you.

763
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,088
Judy, come on.

764
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,589
I warned you about this, Peter.

765
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:12,767
No, you wanted to play the game.

766
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:18,022
What, are you crying? You don't cry,
all right? You keep your chin up.

767
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,274
Come on, keep your chin up.

768
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,694
Crying never helped
anybody do anything, okay?

769
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:28,199
You have a problem,
you face it like a man.

770
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,787
Hey. Hey-

771
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:42,005
I'm sorry. Twenty-six years buried
in the deepest, darkest jungle...

772
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,006
...and I still became my father.

773
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:48,170
It's okay. Come here, I'm sorry.
Hey, it's all right.

774
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:51,172
Remember what you said?
It's all right to be afraid.

775
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,466
It's not that.

776
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,559
What is it?

777
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,399
Okay.

778
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,321
Ready?

779
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:18,784
Don't worry, we're gonna have you turned
back into your old self in no time flat.

780
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,372
Because we're gonna go in here
and together...

781
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:24,209
...we're gonna sit down,
we're gonna finish that game.

782
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,793
No matter...

783
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,333
...what.

784
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,265
Suddenly, I feel right at home.

785
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,598
Lorraine, this is Carl.

786
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,304
I think I know who's behind this.

787
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,391
I'm heading over to the Parrish place.
Give me some backup.

788
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,565
Lorraine?

789
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,980
Wait. Wait!

790
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,569
Now what?

791
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:33,903
Stop!

792
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,239
Wait! Stop!

793
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,785
Is there a problem, ma'am?

794
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:43,584
- Oh, can I have a ride home?
-Where do you live?

795
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,461
Jefferson Street. The old Parrish place.

796
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,248
Do you have children? A boy and a girl?

797
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,088
- Oh, my God. What happened?
-Get in.

798
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,298
I'll explain it all on the way.

799
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,292
Fine! Take it!

800
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,453
We gotta get to that house.

801
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,469
- Shouldn't we play someplace else?
-No.

802
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,882
I grew up in this.
It's out there that scares me.

803
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:44,353
- Okay, it's my turn.
-Sarah, if you roll a 12, you win.

804
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,065
Okay, ready? Here I go.

805
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,273
It's okay.

806
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:00,161
"Every month at the quarter moon,
there'll be a monsoon...

807
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,912
...in your lagoon."

808
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,823
Monsoon.

809
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,366
Well, at least we're inside.

810
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,669
Yeah, right.

811
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:34,194
Well, a little rain never hurt anybody.

812
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:35,946
Yeah, but a lot can kill you.

813
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,528
Come on.

814
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,194
This way!

815
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,122
- What do we do now?
-We get to higher ground.

816
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:52,380
- Okay.
-Come on! Stay together!

817
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:53,881
Peter, go!

818
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:09,726
You all right, Peter?

819
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,484
- Judy!
-Alan?

820
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:14,894
- What?
-What is that?

821
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:19,732
Swim! Go! Go!

822
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,164
- Alan!
-Judy! Swim! Go! Move!

823
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,668
Keep going!

824
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:34,626
Stay on the table!

825
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:37,382
Peter! Feet out of the water!

826
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:42,467
On the chandelier!

827
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:46,016
Stay with Peter!

828
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,936
Come on, Sarah.

829
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,152
Peter!

830
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:08,952
Hang on, Sarah!

831
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,794
Are you okay? Are you okay?

832
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,052
Where--?

833
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,643
- Alan!
-Alan!

834
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,318
Judy? Peter!

835
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:45,030
Ma'am, step back
and let me handle this, please.

836
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:48,162
It's probably nothing.
They probably left the TV on too loud.

837
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,073
Peter? Judy?

838
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,045
I always wanted to do this.
Could you step back, please?

839
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:18,525
- Alan, give me your hand!
-Alan!

840
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:24,194
- Grab my hand!
-I got it.

841
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,702
Alan!

842
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,046
Take the game.

843
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,465
Here. Here you go.

844
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,106
- You okay?
-Yeah.

845
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:05,238
Alan, you wrestled an alligator for me.

846
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:09,901
It was a crocodile.

847
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:14,452
Alligators don't have
that little fringe on their hind leg.

848
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:16,580
Come on.

849
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,546
My mistake.

850
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,175
It's okay.

851
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,276
Come on.

852
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,030
Okay, it's my turn.

853
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,116
I've got it.

854
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,449
Colonel Mustard in the library
with the wrench.

855
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,373
Clue.

856
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,042
Okay.

857
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:15,351
"Beware the ground on which you stand.

858
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:18,388
The floor is quicker than the sand."

859
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,483
- Alan! Okay.
-Help me!

860
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,145
- Help me.
-Okay. Okay. Stay calm.

861
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:27,984
Don't struggle. Stay calm.

862
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,318
-L'm calm.
-Alan!

863
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,534
- Grab on!
-Okay. Pull!

864
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:36,413
Okay. I got it. Pull!

865
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,831
Stay calm!

866
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:43,541
Come on!

867
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:47,003
Oh, good! All right.

868
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:51,337
I got you--

869
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:54,257
Stop giving me things that come apart!

870
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:58,268
"There is a lesson..."

871
01:24:58,427 --> 01:24:59,895
All right.

872
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:04,524
"There is lesson you will learn."

873
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:06,564
Oh, I got you.

874
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:12,198
"Sometimes you must go back a turn."

875
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,945
- Oh, did I hurt you?
-Oh, no.

876
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,739
Oh, dear.

877
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:24,044
Thank you, Judy. Thank you.
That was very quick thinking.

878
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:26,876
Sarah and I would like
to get out of the floor.

879
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,882
So it's your turn, Peter.

880
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,793
Okay.

881
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:39,593
I thought I'd lost you again.

882
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,979
Thanks for sticking around this time.

883
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:50,229
"Need a hand? Why, you just wait.

884
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:54,241
We'll help you out. We each have eight."

885
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,910
What's that? What is it?

886
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,125
- Nothing.
-You don't go...for nothing.

887
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:14,174
Peter, my dad kept an ax
in the woodshed. Go get it!

888
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,010
- Okay.
-Hurry! Go, go, go!

889
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,606
Sarah!

890
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,467
Judy?

891
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,640
Peter?

892
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:05,853
No--

893
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,360
There's a--

894
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,155
- Peter!
-Judy! Behind you, get it!

895
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:29,207
Aunt Nora, it's me. Peter.

896
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:38,007
Sorry. I can't talk right now.
I'll explain later.

897
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,672
- Sarah.
-What?

898
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:42,512
It's your turn.
You can finish if you roll a seven.

899
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:45,427
- I can't roll.
-Put the dice in your mouth.

900
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:48,518
Judy! Bring the game. Hurry!

901
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:55,107
Judy!

902
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:04,245
Judy, are you okay?

903
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,532
I'm fine. Help them.

904
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,204
Come on, Judy. Come on.

905
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,498
-Judy!
-Judy.

906
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,050
Give me the dice.

907
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:29,062
"You're almost there, with much at stake.

908
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,394
But now the ground begins to quake."

909
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,058
Judy!

910
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,778
- Oh, my God!
-What? What?

911
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,074
I wish Mom and Dad were here.

912
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,079
So do I.

913
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,177
Her only chance is if we finish the game!

914
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,134
It's your turn!

915
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:04,764
Oh, my God!

916
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,272
Get the game! The game!

917
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:22,190
No, I won't let you go!

918
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,204
Alan!

919
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:52,433
Don't move.

920
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,143
Stand up.

921
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,987
What's in your hand?

922
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:08,653
Drop it.

923
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,916
End of the line, Sonny Jim.

924
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,710
Game's up. Start running.

925
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,176
No.

926
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:30,384
Aren't you afraid?

927
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:32,434
I'm terrified.

928
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,225
But my father told me...

929
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:38,896
...you should always face
what you're afraid of.

930
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:47,860
Good lad.
You're finally acting like a man.

931
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,704
Any last words?

932
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,045
Jumanji.

933
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,049
It's Jumanji.

934
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:11,265
No, Alan, no!

935
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,822
What--?

936
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,140
Forgot my speech notes.

937
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:48,738
Dad, I'm so glad you're back.

938
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:51,524
I've only been gone five minutes.

939
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:56,162
It seems like a lot longer to me.

940
01:32:57,655 --> 01:33:00,704
Hey, I thought you told me
you were never gonna talk to me again.

941
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:08,501
Whatever I said, Dad, I'm sorry.

942
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:13,346
Look, Alan...

943
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,591
I was angry.

944
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,851
I'm sorry too, son.

945
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:27,561
Look, you don't have to go to Cliffside
if you don't want to.

946
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:34,067
Let's talk it over tomorrow. Man to man.

947
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,864
How about father to son?

948
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,662
Great.

949
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:46,542
Hey, I've gotta get going.
I'm the guest of honor.

950
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:49,875
Dad?

951
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:58,224
Back in 196--
I mean, today in the factory...

952
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,556
...it wasn't Carl Bentley's fault.

953
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,771
I put the shoe on the conveyer belt.

954
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:08,560
Glad you told me, son.

955
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:10,900
Thanks.

956
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,364
Bye, Dad.

957
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:15,567
Goodbye.

958
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:29,081
- Holy smokes! Judy and Peter!
-Alan.

959
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,591
They're not there.

960
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:35,091
It's 1969.

961
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,847
They don't even exist yet.

962
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,334
I'm starting to forget
what it's like to be a grown-up.

963
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:14,300
That's okay,
as long as we don't forget each other.

964
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,177
Or Judy and Peter.

965
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:20,348
Alan, there's something
I've been wanting to do.

966
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,061
And I better do it
before I feel too much like a kid.

967
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:48,501
They probably don't teach driver training
in the sixth grade, huh?

968
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,051
Merry Christmas.

969
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,933
Do you want any of these?

970
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,360
No, Dad. It's a new cross-trainer.
It's doing fabulous.

971
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:20,696
- No, it's not a bra, it's a shoe.
-Honey, they're here.

972
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:24,408
Listen, Dad, I gotta run. Merry Christmas.
We'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

973
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:27,870
You'll be the best Christmas gift of all.
Bye-bye! Bye-bye.

974
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:31,377
- They're here? Let's go.
-Yeah, come on. Okay.

975
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:32,913
- Hi.
-Lisa, hi.

976
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:34,881
Pardon me.

977
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,041
Jim! Glad you could make it.

978
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,087
- Thanks. This is my wife, Martha.
-Hi, Martha. This is Sarah.

979
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:42,301
- Hi, Sarah.
-Where are the kids?

980
01:36:43,298 --> 01:36:45,141
Oh, my God, there they are.

981
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:47,806
How'd you know'?

982
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:51,355
A guess. A guess, of course.
They're your kids.

983
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:53,562
Well, you're right, these are our children.

984
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,899
Judy and Peter.
Kids, say hi to Mr. and Mrs. Parrish.

985
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,404
Nice to meet you.

986
01:36:58,563 --> 01:37:00,406
Nice to meet you.

987
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:04,323
You're just like we remembered you.

988
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:09,161
I feel like we know so much about them.

989
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:11,079
Because, you know--

990
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:14,416
- You've told Alan so much about them.
-Yeah, and I told her.

991
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:17,837
<i>-L'll</i> go get the presents.
- Sure, honey.

992
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,751
Well, we love children.

993
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,591
- Merry Christmas.
-Cool.

994
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:26,799
So when can you start?

995
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:31,472
We were thinking of taking a skiing
holiday up in the Canadian Rockies.

996
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:33,014
"No!
"No!

997
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,358
Sorry.

998
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:38,732
We-- We just...

999
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:41,990
Need you to get that marketing done
on the new line, pronto.

1000
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:45,777
It's no problem. You know,
I could probably start next week.

1001
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:50,915
That'd be great. Let me introduce you to
the rest of the folks you'll be working with.

1002
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:55,750
Come on in. Our house was your house.
ls. Anytime you'd like.

1003
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,008
What's that noise?
