Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Kakarrot?
Yeah, a lower-class warrior child, right?
Nothing to do but send him off to some frontier planet, huh?
I suppose not.

On Planet Vegeta, a baby boy cries for the first time. His father, and his mother planet, are about to be destroyed by a fearsome enemy.

Freeza!
--It's Freeza-sama!
--Freeza-sama!

Everything changes now.

The fate of Planet Vegeta, of Kakarrot......as well as......your fate!
This is the end!
W-What?!
Ka... kar... rot...
Kakarrot!!
My son, Kakarrot...
Carry on my dying wish!
You must avenge the fall of the Saiyans, and of Planet Vegeta!

And so, a baby from a faraway planet falls to Earth.
He was a young boy who had taken the charge of an unknown destiny.

Let's name you... Goku!

This is the tale of Son Goku.
Son Goku would grow up healthy, and together with Bulma, go on a journey to gather the seven Dragon Balls, which were said to grant any wish.

While on this journey, Goku would meet many friends, go through much training, seek for greater strength, and fight. In his battle against the Demon Clan, who sought to rule the world, he would increase his power even further under the guidance of the martial arts sage Karin-sama, and masterfully put a stop to the schemes of Piccolo Daimao, who had once again become young with the Dragon Balls.
Piccolo would leave behind his offspring before dying. Three years later, Ma Junior, the reincarnation of Piccolo, and a grown-up Goku would wage battle in a fateful confrontation.
Following a heated battle, Goku would claim the victory.
It's now a little more than five years later.
Goku and Chichi had abruptly gotten married, and the people were living in peace.
However...

"Prologue to Battle! The Return of Son Goku."

Gohan-chan!
Lunchtime!
Gohan-chan!

This is a good one.

Gohan-chan!

Ah, welcome home.

Goku-sa, where's Gohan?

I'm starving!

What are you talkin' about?
Have you seen Gohan-chan?

Huh? No, I ain't seen him.

You have to hurry and eat before you leave, or you're goin' to keep Muten Roshi-sama and the others waitin'.

All right, I'll go look for him.
I don't think he's gone too far away.
Yeah. I'll take care of it!
I'm countin' on you!

You sure are pretty.

My name is Son Gohan.

Ah! Wait!

Mother! Father!

Gohan!

F-Father!

Sit tight! I'm coming to help right now!

Gohan!

A little farther...

--Father!
--Gohan!

Father!

Gohan!

Father! I can't get down!

I'm scared! I'm scared! Father!

Father, I was so scared!
I was so scared, Father!

Gohan......how did you get up here?

I-I don't know.

Gohan, let's go home.
Mommy is worried about you.
We have to be going to Old Timer Turtle Hermit's place soon, too.

Mm-hmm.

Whoo, just about there...

W-W-What was that just now?!
A meteor?! A UFO?!
T-That's no meteor. What the heck is it?
W-Who are you...?

A battle power of just 5? What trash.

D-Don't you come near me! I-I'll shoot!

Hmph. What a frail race this is.
There's someone with a large power here. Range 4,880.
Is that you, Kakarrot?!

W-What power is this?! it couldn't be...Son Goku?!
No, it isn't!

You're not Kakarrot.

Who are you? Do you have some business with me?

I have no business with you.

Then what did you come here for? Do you want to die?

You're mighty spirited, huh? Hmm, battle power 322. So there's someone like you around, is there?

Still......you are no match for me.

What was that?! Do you know who you're saying that to?!

Not really.

What's with this guy's power...?

Such a worthless technique.
Is kicking up dust all it does?
Is it my turn now? Well then, let me show you a sampling of my moves.
There's another large power.
That way. Range 12,909. it's big.
The biggest power on the planet.
This time for sure, it's Kakarrot!

I-Impossible...
I-I was shaking so hard, I couldn't move...

Good afternoon!
Long time no see!

Bulma-san!

You said come pay a visit, so here I am.

Well, well, it really has been a long time.
This house is the same as it always has been, huh?

You are so cold.
Unless someone tells you to come visit, you stay away.

Here.
Some manju buns, as a gift.

You didn't have to go to all that trouble. If you'd just let me touch your boobs a little bit...
You don't appreciate my gags, same as ever.

You're the same lecherous jerk as ever!

By the way, Bulma-san, where is Yamucha-san?

Yamucha? That idiot? How should I know about him?
I am so fed up with him, I didn't tell him we were all getting together today.
Let's have a blast without him!

You sure do fight a lot, huh?

They sure do.

Incidentally, where is Lunch-san?

She went off somewhere, chasing Tenshinhan-san, five years ago.

The location of this power is moving at considerable speed.

See? That's Muten Roshi-sama's house.
Yoo-hoo!

I-Is that...?

--Son-kun!
--Goku!

--Yo!
--Huh? What's with the boy?

Have you started working as a babysitter or something?

He's my boy.

Y-Yours, Goku?!

Yeah, that's right. Is that strange?

Go on, say hello.

Good afternoon.

--R-Right.
--Good afternoon.

His name is Son Gohan.

Son Gohan? I see, so you've given him the name of your late grandpa?

Yeah.

I have to say, I'm amazed. To think that you'd be bringing a child along, Goku...

Gohan-kun, how old are you?

I'm four years old.

Wow, he has good manners, considering he's your son, Son-kun.

Chichi is really fussy about that.

Say, Gohan-kun, what do you want to be when you grow up?

A great scholar.

S-Scholar?

A tail...?

Yeah.

Just like I used to have, right?

Y-You're right.

S-Say, does anything particularly strange happen to your boy?

Strange?

F-For example, does he change at all on nights with a full moon?

Nights with a full moon? I don't know. We go to bed early at my house.

--How come?
--N-Never mind, it's nothing.

If that's the case, then all right.

S-Say, Goku, is he strong, like you are?

About that...I think he's got quite a bit of power, but when I try to train Gohan, Chichi gets mad.

Rock, paper, scissors!

What for? That's such a waste, isn't it?

Ain't it?

She says the world is at peace now, so we don't need martial arts no more. She says from now on, it's the age of studying.

So that tomboy of a girl turned out to be an education-minded mom?

Father!

Say, is that a Dragon Ball stuck to Gohan-kun's hat?

Yeah, that's Si Xing Qiu. It is a keepsake from my grandpa, after all. I searched for it, and stuck it on there. I found San Xing Qiu and Liu Xing Qiu while I was at it. They're back at home.

That sure takes me back. The Dragon Balls, huh?

--What's that?!
--What's wrong?

S-Something's coming this way.

Something's coming?

It's awesome! I sense an awesome power! What is it?!

It's here!

Here it comes!

W-What is that?

Who is it?!

What a brutal bloodlust!

So, we finally meet. You've grown up. But I knew it was you at first glance, Kakarrot.

Kakarrot?

You look just like our father.

What does he mean?

W-What is this? What's he talking about?

Kakarrot, what is with the condition of this planet? Your mission was supposed to be to exterminate all of humanity. What the hell have you been goofing around for?!

Hey, now, hold on, you. I don't know who you are, but go away, go away. Shoo, shoo!
Man, it just isn't right to be drunk this early in the afternoon. --Okay then, go on, go on.

--Kuririn! Keep away from him!
Kuririn! Why, you...!

What's this? A man with a tail has appeared.


"The Enemy is Goku's Brother?! The Secret of the Mighty Saiyan Warriors."

A-A tail! This guy has a tail, too!

It looks like you've finally realized who I am.

Who you are?

--What do you mean?!
--Here, come over here with us.

Kakarrot...

...have you even forgotten about that?

My name ain't that
funny-sounding Kaka-whatever!

I am Son Goku!

How can this be?

You stay over there!

Hey!

Have you ever taken any strong
shocks to the head in the past?

What?

Did you hit your head hard,
say, when you were a child?

Answer my question!

I did!

I don't remember it, but I hit
my head when I was really little.

Just as I suspected.

Even so, what does it
have to do with anything?!

Goku!

A long time ago, your grandfather,
Son Gohan, said something to me.

One day, in a deep valley,

he discovered a strange object
that looked like it had fallen there.

When he got closer, he saw a baby
with a tail, inside a round capsule.

He decided to take him home and raise him,

but he had a violent disposition,
and wouldn't take to him.

He said he was at a complete
loss as to what to do with him.

But one day, he accidentally fell into a ravine,

hit his head hard, and nearly died,

but he said the baby had
an unbelievable life force,

and he ended up surviving.

What's more, he said that after that,

his violent nature disappeared,
and he became a good boy.

A-And that was me?

--Mm-hmm.
--W-What does that mean?

Are Son-kun and that guy somehow connected?

Just who the hell are you?!

Tell me who you are!

I will tell you.

You are not from this planet.

You were born on Planet Vegeta!

You are a Saiyan,

a proud member of the strongest
warriors in the universe!

--The universe?!
--Warriors?!

Saiyan?!

And I am your older brother, Raditz!

G-Goku's older brother?!

You're brothers?! No way!

Don't give me that malarkey!

Y-Yeah! if Goku is an alien,
what's he doing on Earth?!

The answer is simple. Kakarrot,
you were sent here to exterminate

the humans who are cluttering up this planet.

W-What did you say?!

We Saiyans are a highly renowned warrior race.

Our job is to travel around the universe,

looking for planets that
have good environments,

exterminating the people
already living on them,

and then selling them to aliens
seeking a suitable planet

for a high price.

Adult warriors are sent to the worlds

of those who have a high battle power,

but for lower-level planets,
like this one, babies like you are sent.

Kakarrot...

Even by yourself, a few years
should have been plenty of time

for you to have liquidated these pests.

If you had only remembered
your mission, that is.

Luckily, this world has a moon, as well.

Hey, why is it lucky that there's a moon here?

Don't play dumb!
It's when the moon becomes full

that we Saiyans really start
hitting our stride, you know!

What are you talking about?!
I have no idea what you mean!

What?

Y-You don't mean...

Your tail!

What happened to your tail?!

It got cut off and disappeared a long time ago!

H-How can that be?! You miserable fool!

It's no wonder you get along so
well with the people of this world!

Enough!

Whether I'm from another planet,
named whatever,

or you're really my brother, it doesn't matter!

Anyone who would
exterminate all humans is the pits!

I am Son Goku, and I was raised here!
Get out of here, right now!

Yeah, yeah!

You heard him! Whatever his past was,

right now, Son Goku is a
better earthling than anyone!

Goku has even saved the world! Beat it! Beat it!

I'm afraid I can't do that, you see.

The Saiyans weren't a race
of many people to begin with,

but now Planet Vegeta has exploded,

after a giant meteor collided with it.

Most of the other Saiyans
were vaporized into space dust.

Including our father and mother.

There are now only four
Saiyans left, including you.

Myself and one of the others survived

because we were off attacking another planet.

The other one got lucky because he
was sent to a planet, like you were.

Just recently, we found a nice planet

that we should be able
to sell for a very high price.

We'd like to attack it,

but it would be a bit of an uphill
battle with just the three of us.

That's when I remembered about you, Kakarrot.

Your battle power is still less than perfect,

but if you joined the three of us,
we would be able to manage.

--Stay back!
--Open your eyes, Kakarrot!

It will be fun!

I-I'm scared!

Don't be ridiculous!

I'd rather die than help you!

I see.

I've been wondering about something.

That's your son behind you, isn't it?

N-No!

It's no use trying to pretend.

What about the tail?

That proves he has Saiyan blood, doesn't it?

So what if he does?!

Since you, the father,
aren't being very reasonable,

what if I were to borrow
the son for a little while?

Keep back!

Just try to come any closer!

I'll send you flying!

Father!

--Father!
--Whoa, there!

Kakarrot, I have your child.

If you want him back alive,
you'll follow your brother's orders!

D-D-Damn it...!

Kakarrot, I'm giving you
one day, so think about it.

You don't have any choice
but to go along with us.

However, you're going to
have to show me some proof.

Oh, but it will be easy. By this time tomorrow,

you will kill, let's say, a hundred
people from this planet,

and pile up their bodies here!

You heard me. I'll be looking
forward to tomorrow.

He's my own brother's son.

If at all possible,
I'd like to avoid killing him.

I'm scared, Father!

G-Gohan!

Listen up. I'm going to say
this again, just to be sure.

You will kill one hundred
people from this planet

and pile their bodies up here, by tomorrow.

Do that, and we'll let you join us.

Of course, if there are no bodies,
it will mean the death of your son.

Y-You coward! Using a child like that!

Y-Yeah!

Right!

For one thing, there's no way
Goku could kill anyone!

That's fine.

As long as he doesn't mind if this one dies,

there's no need for him to get
those hundred bodies ready.

But...

...either way, the people of this planet

are destined to be wiped out before long.

Once we subjugate this upcoming planet,

we've decided that our
next target will be this world!

W-What?!

The three of us Saiyans
should be able to exterminate

the people of this planet in just one month.

Father!

You got that, Kakarrot?

No matter how you struggle,

you have no choice but to
join your brother and his pals.

G-Give me back the child!

I'll be expecting a positive answer from you.

For your sake, as well.

Don't think you can go against me.

With your work-in-progress battle power,

there's no way you're a
match for your older brother!

Father!

Bye, now! I look forward to tomorrow!

Gohan!

Father!

Gohan!

Are you okay, Son-kun?

S-Sorry, there was nothing
we could have done.

Goku...

Kinto Un!

Hold on! That's crazy! Don't be hasty!

Y-You can't! You'll be killed!

Damn! What should I do?!

Think.

Steady, now.

It's shocking, huh?

You unexpectedly discover you have a relative,

and it's that guy, of all people.

Your brother's strength is monstrous, and all.

His tail.

If I...

if I grab his tail hard,
his strength should slacken.

I was the same way.

B-But still, will you even
be able to grab his tail?

You can't do it yourselves!

Piccolo!

You must know well enough that
his strength is out of your league.

He isn't the sort of opponent that
you or I could take on directly.

However...

...if you and I team up,

there is a slight chance
that we could defeat him.

What on earth has gotten into you?

Don't get me wrong.

It's not like I've had my eyes
opened to peace, or anything.

I don't care about your son, either.

He just stands in the way of my
goal of world domination, that's all!

I'll team up with you,

and once we've dealt with him
and those two buddies of his...

...then of course, I plan to defeat you,

and make the world mine this time for sure!

I won't let you do that.

I won't let you do that,

but the part about the two of us
teaming up is a good idea.

It looks like there ain't any
other way to do it, huh?

That's right. We'll just have to put up with it.

As far as I'm concerned, teaming up
with you makes me want to vomit.

Bulma, let me borrow your Dragon Radar!

R-Right!

Can you keep up with Kinto Un's speed?!

Don't be absurd!

My own technique is a little different

than your pathetic Bukujutsu technique.

Let me out!

Let me out! Let me out!

Now then...

That's strange. A warning signal.

Battle power 710? it's close!

What?!

Damn, it's malfunctioning, huh?

Don't startle me like that.

We should descend now, and move in on him.

It won't work! We should keep going like this!

He uses a device.

It seems to be able to clearly
tell him his target's position,

and even their strength.

You mean, the fact that
we're closing in on him, too...?

I'm sure he's aware of it.

You don't say. That means that all
we can do is attack him head-on!

Again?

Battle power 710. Tch,
it's a malfunction, all right.

Two readings?

They're headed this way!

One... two...

Battle power 322 and 334.

One of them is the same
power that Kakarrot has!

But there's no way he'd be coming.

He has to know that there's
next to zero chance of him winning.

And he wouldn't know
where I am in the first place.

I give up. This thing is completely busted.

It can't be!

They're here!

How did you know where I was?

As if I'd tell you!

Very well, I'll ask you a different question.

What are you two doing here?

Isn't that obvious?
We came to get my boy back!

Which means that even though you're a Saiyan,

you're refusing to join us, is that it?

That's what I told you!

You intend to defy your brother?

I ain't got any brothers!

Kakarrot...

I thought you were a bit sharper than this.

That's enough yammering out of you.

His battle power just went up to 408.

Is that right? You've been
training like crazy, too?

This should make the fight go a little better.

Kakarrot is now 416!

You guys think you're stronger now?!

What?!

You make me laugh!

To think that you would just
waltz on in here at that level!

This is what it means to not know your place!

Winning a fight ain't just
about who's the strongest!

We've got ourselves a strategy!

You think you're clever, do you?

Kakarrot, I've decided to
give up on letting you join us.

After all, it looks like
you'd just slow us down.

You're a disgrace to the family! Die!

I think I'll let you in on a little
something before you die.

The two other remaining Saiyans

have an even higher battle power than I do!


A Life-or-Death Battle! Goku and Piccolo's Ferocious suicide Attack"

Goku was powerless against the
might of his Saiyan brother, Raditz.

--Father!
--Whoa, there!

Kakarrot, I have your child.

If you want him back alive,
you'll follow your brother's orders!

Will he be able to get Gohan back?


if you're just finding out
how fearsome a Saiyan is,

it's already too late.

For those who still defy me

after I've gone to the trouble of
warning them, there is only death!

He's got us.

To think that there are even
stronger guys than him out there.

It's exciting, isn't it, Son Goku?

Sorry, but this time, I ain't feeling excited.

I'm so scared, I'm shaking.

It's only natural. But that terror
will soon be turning to despair.

Never mind me, where is my son?!
Where did you hide him?!

I haven't hidden him. He was just
wailing so loud, I locked him up.

You see that hole behind you? He's in there.

Over there?

Gohan...

Father! Help me! Father!

Just sit tight, Gohan! Daddy will
help you out of there right away!

Don't be ridiculous!

There's no way you can help him!

Not when you guys are going to die first!

All right, let's do it!

We don't have any other choice!

Behind me!

Yikes!

W-Where did you go?!

Right here.

D-Damn! A-Are you all right, Piccolo?!

R-Relax. I can still manage
to fight with one arm.

It looks like your deaths are drawing near!

Hey, Son Goku, do you have
any new moves up your sleeve?

Sorry, but to be honest, I ain't got any.

You've been slacking.

And here, I've been training earnestly,
developing a new move.

What are you whispering about?

Whatever strategy you
come up with, it won't work!

It'd be easier on you if
you just croaked right away.

Can you do it with only one arm?

Yeah, that part's all right.

But it takes quite a bit of time
to build up the Ki for this move.

While I do, you fight him by yourself,

and keep his attention drawn.

You got it.

I had been saving this to kill you with.

And now, you might just
end up saving me with it, huh?

If I'm able to kill him with it,
your turn will come next.

All right, I can't wait to see it!

Now, let's see if I can keep him bottled up!

You sure are persistent!

Ka......me...

His battle power is going up!

...ha......me...

A-And his battle power is 1,080!
Unbelievable! it's still going up!

...Ha!!

You've got some nerve!

H-He caught it!

I have a present for you, now!

Die!

Battle power 1,322 ...!

H-He's concentrated all of his battle power

into his fingertips!

D-Damn! These guys are able to
manipulate their power at will!

Take this on! Makankosappo!!

H-He dodged it!

To think that you'd injure me...

You'll pay for that!

See you in Hell!

You dropped your guard, huh?

Now I've got your tail!

W-When did you manage to...

Piccolo! Now! Do that thing again!

You've outdone yourself, Goku!
Hold onto that tail tightly!

I can only use this technique one more time!

K-Kakarrot, y-you would kill your only brother?

Shut up! I told you, anyone as
cruel as you are ain't my brother!

Don't you talk about yourself like that,

not after you were about to kill me!

I-I'll stop! I've had a change of heart!

I'll leave this planet without any more trouble!

Don't fall for it, Son Goku!

He doesn't mean what he's saying!

There's no way he's going to do that!

P-Please, believe me, my brother!

Sure, I've done a lot of
terrible things up to now,

I-including to you. But I will
keep my promise to you!

Y-You mean it?

I-I mean it!

N-No! Don't let go of his tail! That's his ploy!

Please, Kakarrot! Believe me!

Son Goku!

You hapless fool! it's rare to
find anyone as dumb as you!

T-That was dirty!

But I'm not like you.
I am a first-class warrior!

I won't hesitate for a moment to kill you,

even if you are my brother!

You want me to show you
what I'm talking about? Hmm?

Suffer some more! Your death is near!

What's the matter?
Do that thing you did earlier!

H-He'll just avoid it again like this!

What?!

W... What's this?!

Impossible...

G-Gohan...?

R-Run away, Gohan...

Run away!

B-Battle power... 1,307 ?!

Stop picking on...

...my father!!

Ow!

G-Gohan...

Father!

D-Did you...?

F-Father...

Y-You little brat!

R-Run away!

Gohan, run away!

Run away! Hurry!

N-Now his battle power is just 1?

I-It changes completely,
together with his feelings.

Run away!

Gohan!

S-Stop! Don't do it! He's just...

Just a child, is that what you're telling me?

You've got to be kidding.

That kid has a battle power
far higher than you two.

I'll kill him now, before he becomes
able to better use his power.

Don't worry, though.
I'll reunite you soon enough.

In the next world, that is.

Wait!

You're the first one to ever
do this much damage to me.

But this is where it ends!

Die!

W-Why, you!

Piccolo!

Quick! That technique from before!

I've been getting it ready,
thinking this might be coming!

But I'll need... a little more time!

Piccolo! Hurry!

Make it quick!

Let me go, Kakarrot! You idiot!

With us stuck together, you won't
come out unharmed, either!

Then I'll die right along with you.

W-What did you say?!

A-Are you out of your mind?!

There ain't any other way to defeat you!

Son Goku...

I'm not going to hold back!

Nothing would be better than
having you out of the picture, too!

L-Let me go! I-I was wrong!

I won't ever come to this planet again!

Y-You're not going to trick me again!

It's no lie! D-Don't you trust
your own brother's word?!

Piccolo! Hurry it up!

Sorry to keep you waiting. Are you ready?

Do it!

Take this!

Wait!

Makankosappo!!

D-Damn it all!

D-Damn! To think that I would be...
d-done in... by these guys...

I-imagine, Kakarrot...

...g-giving up his... own life...

Son Goku can be brought
back to life in no time.

What?!

On this planet, we have some
nice things we call Dragon Balls.

By making a request to them,
any wish you desire is possible.

Even bringing the dead back to life.

D-Damn...

Still, I'm glad you told me that.

This entire situation up to now

has been transmitted to my two
companions, far away in outer space.

--What?
--W-When they learn I've been beaten, they...

...they're sure to be coming here...

They'll sweep not just you,

but everyone on this planet,

away in the... blink of an eye...

T-Those... two guys...

W-When will they... get here...?

One year... Just one year...

In one year, two more of you,
who are even stronger...

it was a short-lived celebration, huh...?

You guys are no more than worms after all...

You can rest in peace now.

You had to go and open your big mouth.

Son Goku, he's dead.

Ah! There are a few of them down!

W-Who's that still standing?

It's Piccolo!

Raditz is dead.

Seriously, how pathetic.

To think that he was killed

by guys whose battle power
was just over a thousand.

What do we do? Put this planet
on hold, and go there?

They did say something... interesting, huh?

About "Dragon Balls" or whatever.

Yeah. Supposedly, they grant any wish.

All right, let's go.

We're going to bring Raditz back to life, right?

You must be joking. We don't
need that useless guy anymore.

How does this sound?

We never grow any older, and gain eternal life?

By doing that, we'll be able
to enjoy fighting forever.

I get you. That would be great!

And that's how it happened.

I-I see.

Goku! Goku, I say!

Hey, Goku! Stay with me!

Gohan-kun is all right. He's just unconscious.

Thank... goodness...

--He's coming to!
--Goku!

...I won't have to have Chichi yell at me.

Son-kun...

K-Kuririn...

Dying is... pretty... n-nasty, huh?

W-What are you talking about,
Goku?! Get hold of yourself!

This isn't like you!

L-Looks like this time, at least, I'm done for.

D-Don't worry! We'll bring
you back to life right away!

P-Please do...

Goku...

Goku!!


Run in the Afterlife, Son Goku! The Million Kilometer Serpent Road!" 
  
I'll bet that right now,  Goku-san and the others are having a fun time at the Kame House. 

I wonder if Gohan's fittin' in with them okay. 

Then again, he'll be fine. 

He's a well-behaved boy. 

I wish I've gone. 

Gohan-chan! 

Pa! 

Chichi, where's Gohan-chan? 

Hey, Gohan-chan! I brought you a whole heap of presents! 

Pa! 

Goku! Goku!! Goku! 
--Goku... --Hey, Goku! Son-kun, don't die! Goku! Goku! 

He disappeared! 

I get it. 
This is Kami's doing. 

He's about the only one who could do something like this. 

The bastard has another one of his worthless ideas. 

I wonder what he intends to do. 

Hmm... T-Then again, if it's Kami-sama, I suppose we can relax. 

Whatever the case, we have to gather the other six Dragon Balls and bring Goku back to life right away. 

Man! 

At a critical time like this, where could Yamucha and the others have gone off to?! 

You're the one who drove him off, aren't you? 

You know, I wonder how Son-kun's brother knew where he was so easily. 

It's that strange device he is wearing on his face. 
Apparently, it can tell an opponent's strength and location. 

--Kuririn... --R-Right! Right, right, right... That's it, there. 
Kuririn, grab it for me, okay? 

Eh? Uh, o-okay. 
He's not going to come back to life or anything, right?

Let's see, this goes like that...

This gizmo is amazing.

It's a little damaged, but I think I can do something with it.

You're incredible, Bulma-san.

Once I take this back, study it, and refurbish it, we might be able to locate Yamucha, Tenshinhan and the others.

Well, in any case, let's get back to the Kame House.

Right. There's nothing more we can do here, huh?

Okay then, afterward, I'll start looking for the Dragon Balls, right away.

Piccolo, what do you intend to do--

Just like a lizard's tail...

You guys look for the Dragon Balls.

Kami doesn't have the power to bring people back to life himself.

But I will be taking charge of Son Goku's son there.

W-What are you going to do?

That Gohan kid could become a powerful force, depending on how he is trained.

If we're going to prevail against the two Saiyans

who will be coming in one year, we're going to need his strength.

In order for that to happen, I'm going to have to train him.

You can't be serious.

I'm not sure that's going to go over well...

Mm-hmm, we'll have to ask Goku, and the boy's mother, Chichi, first.

We can't afford the time!

Don't give me any trouble, or I'll kill you, and then take him!

Once a year is up, I'll come to your house, together with the kid.

Once you bring Son Goku back to life, tell him he can look forward to seeing him then.

I don't know... I don't know about this...

He's gonna die! if he's lucky, he'll just turn out delinquent!

With that in mind, he has arrived here in flesh-and-blood form, wishing to be allowed to train.

Please, Great King Yama, I humbly ask that you permit this man to call upon Kaio-sama.

Son Goku, huh? indeed, your marks are outstanding.

You're saying that even though he could go to Heaven, he wants to risk the danger of traversing the Serpentine Road to see Kaio-sama, is that it?

Yes, sir.

Hey, does everyone come here once they die?

--That's right.
--Even aliens?

Mm-hmm. Everyone who is dead comes here to be judged, to see if they go to Heaven or Hell.
Hey, just a little before I got here, did a guy named Raditz pop in here?
Watch it! You have to say "come through here."
Yeah, he came through here, all right. He was your brother, right? He was sent to Hell, naturally.

He didn't make any trouble?

Oh, he made trouble. He made trouble, but I overpowered him.

You're pretty strong, ain't you, taking someone as awesome as he was?

Maybe I should have pops here train me!

Shh! You're being too loud!

You shouldn't be using language like that about Great King Yama!

But...

Keep quiet! Kaio-sama is even stronger!

I heard that, Kami of Earth!

Ulp!

Once you die, maybe I ought to send you to Hell.

P-Please forgive me!

I never imagined you would be able to hear that!

You've got the devil's own ears, all right! Get it?

You've no sense of humor, huh?

No...

Very well. if you want to go that badly, you may go to Kaio-sama.

T-Thank you very much!

I'll call over a guide for you. Go out that way and wait.

'Kay!

However...!

Don't come crying to me if you fall off of the Serpentine Road.

Well, do your best.

This whole year will be a challenge for you.

Yeah. I'm not sure what you're getting at, but anyhow, I'm gonna go and see this Kaio-sama guy.

Mm-hmm.

Thanks! Say hi to Mister Popo for me!

I have to say, Earth has attracted the attention of some real bad eggs.

This time around, things could get really dangerous.

Even if we wished for Shen Long to eliminate them,

I doubt he could prevail against the Saiyans' tremendous power.

Even with Son Goku receiving training from Kaio-sama, just how far will he be able to come?

Only Goku's son can save us.

How is Piccolo going to raise Son Gohan?

And with only the limited time we have, how exactly--

Shut up!

You're in the way! Would you leave, already?!

S-Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm very sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

Thank you for waiting.

Now then, I will show you to the serpent's head.

The Serpentine Road is quite harrowing.

Are you in good physical health?

No...

I'm dead, so I suppose I ain't in very good health.

Say, what's this Kaio-sama guy like?

Sir, Kaio-sama is the gentleman that reigns over all other deities in the universe.

Oh, yeah? I'm sure he must be pretty strong, then.

We can't very well not say anything to Chichi about this.

Kuririn, you go over there and explain the situation to her.

Eh?! M-Me?!

It sounds like she's a domineering mother, so you're dead for sure.

Sir, we have arrived.

This is the Serpentine Road?

Yes.

What do I do now?

Please follow the serpent all the way down.

It leads to where Kaio-sama is.

It sure looks long.

Yes, sir. According to legend, it is about a million kilometers long.

A million kilos?!

Has anyone ever made it to the end?

Over these last hundred million years,

I believe that Great King Yama is the only one who has.

That older guy, huh?

But then, if there is someone who's made it there, maybe I'll be able to manage it, too.

Ah, please be absolutely sure not to fall into the clouds.

Beneath the clouds is where Hell is, after all, and you will not be able to return.

Oh, okay.

Aw, rats. I should have packed something for lunch.

That's okay, sir.

You are already deceased, so I doubt you will die of hunger.

Oh, yeah.

Well...

Oh, right! I have a favor to ask.

Yes?

Do you know Uranai Baba?

Yes, sir. She visits here once in a while.

Thank goodness! Next time she comes here, ask her to tell Old Man Turtle Hermit not to bring me back to life for one year, okay?

Very good, sir.

Let's see... for one year... to Mr. Turtle Hermit, right?

Okay, let's give this a go.

So as long as I don't fall off the snake, I'm fine, right?

Yes. Do take care.

Bukujutsu!!

"Son Goku... has been killed.

Please accept my condolences."

That might be a bit too much of a shock...

"Er, I'm sorry to have to tell you that Goku has passed on to his eternal rest..."

But then, he is coming back to life...

That's it! I'll go with cheerful!

"Uh, Goku is dead, but he'll be coming back to life really soon, so there's nothing to worry about."

Ah, Kuririn!

H-H-Hello...

What are you doin', babblin' to yourself out here?

Uh, well, er, y-you see... a-allow me to offer...

Hey there! Long time no see!

Ah, hello! T-Thanks for saying so.

I thought you were with Goku-sa and the others.

Ah, well, you see... t-the truth is, Goku d-d--d-d-d--

What?

"D-Don't worry about me," he says!

Oh, so he's goin' to be late after all?

Yeah! Yes. Actually, Goku won't be coming back...

You say he's not comin' back?

No! He is coming back to us very soon...

What are you sayin'?! I don't get it!

Now, now, let's not stand out here talkin'.

Come on in the house. Come on, come on.

Would you wake up already, son of Son Goku?!

We have to talk. Get out of the water.

Who are you? Father?!

Father! Where are you?!

Father! Father!

Father! I'm scared!

Lousy brat!

Don't give me any trouble!

Stop blubbering! Be quiet, or I will snap your neck!

All right, listen closely to what I'm about to say.

First, your father is dead.

You remember some of it, right?
He sacrificed himself in order to defeat that man.

Piccolo! Hurry! Do that technique again!

Do it!

Take this! Makankosappo!!

Father is...

Whoa, don't cry! I really will snap your neck!

You've heard about the Dragon Balls from your father, right?

Goku's friends are collecting them now to bring him back to life.

However, that's not what the matter is!

We managed to get rid of the guy that kidnapped you, but he said that in another year, there are some friends of his, who are even stronger than he was, who will be coming here. When they do, even with Son Goku brought back to life, there isn't a chance of us winning with just me and him. We need your strength, too. You're going to train to learn fighting tactics, and defend the Earth!

Huh? Me? Nuh-uh. I can't fight at all.

Apparently, you haven't realized it yourself, but the power you have hidden within you is something else.

That's why you're going to train to draw that power out, and become able to use it effectively.

No way. I don't have that kind of power.

You want to see some proof?

What are you doing?!
Wah! That hurts! That hurts! Stop it!
That hurts! Stop it! That hurts! That hurts!

Now, show me your inner power!
W-What the...?
A-Astonishing. It's greater than I imagined.
I'm having mixed feelings.
I'm about to raise someone who could become my greatest enemy in the future.

D-Did I do that?

That's right. it looks like you're starting to understand.
Whenever your emotions become substantially excited, you exhibit your intrinsic inner power.
But it only happens for an instant.
We can't win that way.
I'm going to beat the way to fight into you, and make you the ultimate warrior. Got it?

But I don't want to become a martial artist.
I want to be a great scholar.

Go ahead, then.
But do it after we defeat the two Saiyans that will be coming here in a year.
They're planning to exterminate everyone on Earth.
If they do that, then there is no future, or anything else, right?

But I'm scared.

Stop your whining! Do you want to get killed right now?!
We don't have time! We're starting right now!
Take off your top!

If my father is coming back to life, I want to be taught by him.

Too bad. Sure, he may be strong, but he's not at all cut out to be a teacher.
He has absolutely no sternness when it comes to others.
You can tell that just by looking at how spoiled you are.

Huh?

Whoops. I used up too much of my strength, and now I can't fly.


Wilderness Survival! A Moonlit Night Awakens Gohan!

W-What should I do for training?

At first, you don't have to do anything. Just live.

Live?

If, after six months, you've managed to survive, I'll teach you how to fight.

No! I'll be so lonely, I'll die!

You won't be lonely. This area is crawling with bloodthirsty beasts.

Oh, no! Don't do this! Don't leave me here!

You don't have time to be this spoiled now!

But I...

Manage to survive this six months somehow, and gain a little toughness first. Both physically and mentally. Do not forget that you hold the key to the fate of the Earth. Believe in your own power. And learn for yourself an effective way to bring forth that power.

But I...

Bye now.

Wait! Where is my food? My bath? My bed?

You think that stuff has been prepared for you, sweet prince? If you have to blame something, blame your own fate. Like I do.

Wait! I'm scared! Don't leave me!

Kami-sama, acting strange. Something wrong?

Piccolo really is different than he was before, somehow. There's no doubt he's still evil, but it feels like he's lost some of that wily coarseness he had long ago.

Popo think so too. Old Daimao not make Son Goku's son stronger.

What made me clearly realize that there is something odd about Piccolo is that when Son Goku's brother, Raditz, was killed by him, his soul went straight to the Next World. Up until now, the souls of those killed by a demon clansman did not cross over, and just suffered as they drifted between heaven and Earth. And yet, since Raditz went to the Next World, this is clearly not the Piccolo of old.

Piccolo now has good heart?

Perhaps he has become aware that my life, and thus Piccolo's life, has only one year left.

One year...?

Whether that's because Piccolo will be killed by the Saiyans who will be here in one year, or because my lifespan will run out around that time, I don't know. My death will mean Piccolo's death, and Piccolo's death will mean my death. Though I may be Kami, it's unpleasant knowing when I'm going to die. He must sense it, too. He must want to leave something behind, even if it is to Son Goku's son.

Then, Dragon Balls can only be used...

Mm-hmm. The next time will be the last one.

To think that Gohan was that strong! I had no idea at all. He is my child, all right! 
That's right! Nothing says I have to walk along the road, huh?
All right... I'll get there in no time like this!
Yow-ow-ow-ow!
That was close, that was close!
That's Hell down beneath the clouds.

Help! Somebody, help! I can't get down!

Crap! That guide said that once I was dead, I wouldn't get hungry, but here I am, famished!

What? You couldn't tell them?

I'm very sorry.

You mean, not any of it?

No...

You're hopeless. Geez, you've got no spine.

That's easy for you to say. If you saw Chichi-san's face, you couldn't tell her that Goku died.

Well, I can't blame you. But unless we do something... if we write her a letter explaining the situation, she might understand, right?

Yes, you're right! That's a good idea!

By the way, Kuririn, what about the Dragon Balls?

There were two of them at Son-kun's house, right?

I forgot.

You good-for-nothing!

I'm scared! I'm cold!
I'm hungry! I'm going to die!
Apples! Some apples have fallen here! Lucky me!
Oh, well.
It's sour! Yuck!
I want Chinese buns!
I want shaomai dumplings!

You dirty brat, making me take care of you!

I'm scared... I'm scared...

Mind you, this is the last time I help you out. From here on, if you can't survive, then that's all you were ever going to amount to.

Too bright!

I can't get down!

I'm hungry!

I'm scared!

If you're hungry, you could come down from there and look for something to eat.

And after I told him, "Make sure you come home before nightfall," too!
It's been a long time since Goku's visited the Kame House.

He just got wrapped up in talkin' about the good old days and lost track of time.

That may be fine and all for Goku-sa, but Gohan has his cram school!
Missin' one day of cram school isn't that big a deal.

You're too lenient, Pa!

From here on in this world, it's those that study who come out ahead!

I wonder if that's got it...

Hey, I'm finally done!

You've got some nerve, kicking back and sleeping at a time like this!

You there, Old Man Turtle, stand up.

O-Old Man Turtle?

I've changed the characters in the display to make it easier to understand.

Let's see...206!

206? I'm not that young.

That's the number that represents your strength, Muten Roshi-sama.

The number that represents my strength?

That's an incredible device, huh?
It can tell you that?

B-Bulma-san, how high am I?

Amazing! it says 239.

I really have surpassed you, Muten Roshi-sama!

H-Hey, are you sure it's not malfunctioning?

--I don't mean to brag, but my skills are...
--Hey!

Hey!

Who is that calling to us in such a strange way?

It's me.

Y-You're that guy who was at Karin-sama's place...

--Armadillo!
--It's Yajirobe, ya nincompoop!

Ya screwed up my name on purpose!

Karin asked me to come here an' deliver a message to ya!

A message from Karin-sama?

"I am aware of the whole situation."
So you, that Yamucha guy, Ten-somethin'-or-other, and Chaozu are to go there at once.

Huh? All of us, go to Karin Tower?

Why?

Kami-sama, ya see, says he's gonna be givin' us trainin'.

I'm in on this, too.

R-Really?!

Yeah. I told 'im, I ain't up for fightin' them whatchamacall'em aliens, but he says I gotta do it, or else.

I've had it.

A-All right. I'll go find them all, and come, right away.

Bye, then. Can't say I didn't tell ya.

Oh, yeah. Forgot somethin'.

Goku says not to bring 'im back to life 'til them enemies get here.

Huh? W-Why not?

Word is he's gonna train there in the Other World.

Some old lady named Uranai Baba'll be comin' by shortly, an' you can ask her all the details.

W-What? When?

T-Training in the Other World?

W-What the...?

Huh?

He's coming back again.

Ahoy, Muten Roshi-ssms!

It's Chichi and Gyumao!

Muten Roshi-sama, what do we do?

I haven't written that letter yet.

Muten Roshi-sama!

It has been too long! Have you been well?

Er, um, I-I suppose...

My Goku-sa and Gohan are supposed to be here.

Where are they?

U-Um, t-the truth is...

Mumble, mumble, mumble...

He's been taken away by Piccolo Daimao?!

W-What happened to G-G-Goku?!

H-He's dead.

Chichi! Buck up!

How did something like this happen to me?

Huh?

I wonder why it's so light out.

Ah, it's the moon! Wow, it's completely round!

This is the first time I've ever seen a full m--

What?!

At this rate, Earth will be destroyed before the Saiyans even get here!

W-What's going on here?!

Don't play dumb!
It's when the moon becomes full that we Saiyans really start hitting our stride, you know!

That's it!

The full moon!

Get lost!

I-I never imagined he would transform.
Is it his Saiyan blood?
I think I'm starting to understand the secret behind his and Son Goku's power.
It looks like blowing the moon away was the right answer.
It makes me shudder, thinking that the Saiyans might turn into monsters like that.
He said something about their tails, too.
Apparently, to transform, they need their tails and the full moon.

I guess I'll pull out his tail.
Not that I have to worry about it anymore now, but their tails seem to be the Saiyan's weakness.
There.
I suppose I can provide you with clothes and a sword, at least.
I'll make it the same design as your old man's.
The character on it will be different, though.
I have to go attend to my own training, so I'm leaving.
If you can survive here safely for six months, I, Piccolo, will personally put you through special training hell.
So much so, you'll wish you had died.
Brace yourself for it.
I'm going to turn you into a fine demon clansman!


The End of the Line is Reached! Playful Trials of Kaiosama"   

I have to go and attend my own training, so I'm leaving. And so, six months' time has passed. 

All right! 
Oh, is it you again? You 'll never learn, will you? 

Hey ! I'm over here! Nyah-nyah! 

Okay , I'm going to get some more meat now! 

Your tail is going to be all gone before long. 

Hmph, looks like he's gotten a little more favorable. 

A-Ain't I at Kaio-sama's place yet? 

Well, with this many people on our team,  I'm not at all frightened by those Saiyans. 

I can't wait to see what kind of training Kami-sama will give us. 

Mm-hmm. 

We've been apart for half the year now. 
You look like you've gotten a little more favorable. 
Now then, time to start actually putting you through the wringer. 
Come at me! 
What's wrong with you?! 
Over here! 
Do not lose sight of your target! 
I can't see anything move that fast! 
You don't see it. 
You feel it. 
Yeah, that's easy for you to say... 
Ow-www! 

I still ain't able to see the end? 
The tail! I did it! 
I made it! 
Yahoo! 
Huh? 
There's nothing here! 
Aw, man, you're kidding! 
What's that? 
That's it! 
That's where Kaio-sama is! 
Yahoo! 
Sure enough! There's a house there! 
What?! 
What?! 
What?! 
W-What's wrong with the ground here? 
Damn... 
Incredible! it's like I'm being sucked down by an unbelievable power
I-It's no use! it's like my body is as heavy as lead! Damn it...!
I finally... made it this far...
I'm... going to meet...Kaio-sama... no matter what!

A little farther... a little farther...

Just a little farther...

But before I do, I'm gonna find something to eat.

Yow-w-w-w...

K-Kaio-sama? Are you Kaio-sama?

I'm sure he must be awesome, despite how he looks.

G-Good day. I am Son Goku.

I kindly ask for your training.

Kaio-sama, teach me your martial arts, okay?

I mean, please?

I-Is that training?

You want me to move like that?

Kaio-sama, w-what's the matter with the ground here?

Say, what are you doing there?

How about this heat?

What are you doing there?

Huh? W-Who are you?

Who, me?

I am...

...scratch, scratch, scratch...

Kaio!

Then, who's that?

That is my pet, Bubbles-kun.

O-Ohh! And here, I thought it was strange.

You're the strange one.

By the way...

That pun there was the best, don't you think?

You may feel free to laugh at it.

At what?

You must have been too tense to hear it.

What am I to do with you, honestly?

Well, I'll hit you with
another pun, no extra charge.

Hello? Hello?

That's great!

What is?

What have you come here for?

I-I was hoping to have
you train me, Kaio-sama.

Train you?

What is that?! You call that defending?!

You've got to focus your Ki more!
I'm just itching to kill you!

Training, huh? I'd be willing to do that.

Really?!

However...

...you have to pass my test first.

I'll do it once you can make me,
Kaio-sama, the wizard of gags,

laugh at one of your gags.

Eh?! Me, make a pun?!

Losing your nerve, are you?

It has to be a pretty high-level pun,
or I won't laugh at it.

Well, how about it?

It looks like this might be too much for you.

In that case, give up and go home!

M-My futon...

...flew away ["futtonda"]!

Y-Your futon... flew away...

Ah! You laughed! Kaio-sama, you laughed!

You're no slouch at this,
are you? I'll bet you're a pro!

Very well, I shall train you.

I'm going to tell you...

...my greatest gag!

N-Never mind the gags,
teach me some martial arts.

Oh, martial arts? Why didn't
you say so in the first place?

All right, try coming at me!

I'm going to see just how good you are.

What's wrong?

That's just it, there's something
that ain't right here.

My body feels so heavy, it's hard to move.

Where did you come from? Earth?

Mm-hmm.

Then it would be heavy for you, huh?

This is a small planet, but it has
tremendous gravity, you see?

I'd say it's about ten times
what you have on your planet.

So your body weighs ten times as much, too.

Try jumping for me. As high as you can.

O-Okay.

I-It's no use. I can only
go up that short distance.

To be able to jump that high
in ten times his own gravity...

This guy has a lot of promise.

Well then, I'm going to start your training.

How long do you plan on staying?

I don't know how many days I've been
running down the Serpentine Road,

but I don't think I've got that much time.

You see, these Saiyan guys
are coming to our planet

to do some awful things.

So until they do, however short that time is,

I'd like for you to train me.

The Saiyans, huh?

You've drawn the attention of
some formidable folks, all right.

Let's see...

Let me check to see when the
Saiyans will arrive on Earth.

Those are Saiyans flying there, all right.

They'll arrive at Earth in, let's see,

I'd say 158 days.

Awesome! You can tell that much?

These handy antennae are nice
and steady. Get it?

That was great!

Maybe I won't train you after all.

That was great! That was great! That was great!

Wasn't it?

But, I ain't got but 158 days
until the Saiyans arrive?

Hey, 158 days will be plenty.

If I train you on this planet for 158 days,

it will have the same value
as training back on Earth

for thousands of years.

--Really?!
--However...

...even if you do train, you won't
necessarily beat the Saiyans.

That's how terribly strong the
two Saiyans headed to Earth are.

Frankly, their strength is
even greater than mine.

Greater than yours, Kaio-sama?!

That's right.

Which means that if you
can't at least surpass me,

it will be impossible for
you to beat the Saiyans.

Well, we should get started right away.

Hey, Bubbles-kun!

First, you have to overcome
the severe gravity here.

Try to catch Bubbles-kun here.

If you can't at least move
that fast, you'll get nowhere.

A-All right.

Okay, run away, Bubbles-kun!

Hold it!

D-Damn it! My body really does feel heavy!

Damn!

All right...

Just you watch!

I'm gonna catch you!

Oh, he's already wearing
super-weighted gear, is he?

This makes me quite a bit lighter!



The Battle With 10-Times Gravity! Goku, Your Training is a Race" 
  

It's amazing the way you eat...
You could be a little more...
Hey, how about holding back a little?

I'm full, I'm full!
The flavor notwithstanding, at least my belly is full.

I'm getting the feeling that this man doesn't respect me.

You know something, Kaio-sama?
I'm surprised you don't get bored staying on this little planet.

How young you are.

There are any number of fun things to do here, if you feel like it.

Like counting how many blades of grass there are, looking up at the sky, or peeing for distance.

Lately, the hobby I've been caught up in......is going for drives.

Now, hurry up and catch Bubbles-kun.

Otherwise, I won't ever teach you any martial arts.

Y-Yeah, I'll try my hardest.

All right...

Oh, yeah...

Put those heavy-looking clothes and boots you took off earlier back on before you start running.

That will make this more effective.

If I put those on, it will be much, much harder to run.

I'll let you in on a little something.

The world that the Saiyans are from had about the same gravity as here.

That's where they built up their bodies.

Are you starting to understand the secret to the Saiyans' strength?

But there's more to it than just that.

Saiyans have an inborn fighting sense.

That's another dangerous thing about them.

Hey, that's all right. I'm a Saiyan, too!

Nice jab.

But don't let up on your attack!

Uncle!

Help me!

Don't try playing the baby to me, you dirty brat!

Sure enough, he only displays that latent power of his on a night with a full moon.

Ow-w-w-w...

Hmph, it looks like you've at least gotten over your crybaby ways during these last six months, huh?

Say, Piccolo-san, you fought with my father long ago, right?

That fight still isn't over yet.

If we're able to defeat the Saiyans, your father's turn will be next.

But Father said that after you were reborn, Piccolo-san, you don't seem to be as full-blown bad as you were before.

I kind of think so, too.

My mother and grandfather were afraid of you, though.

Stop talking rubbish and get to sleep, already!

Tomorrow's training won't be as gentle as this has been!

Right!

Damn it all...

And so, in the blink of an eye, three weeks went by.

I doubt you know how good......these shao-mai dumplings taste...

That was great, that was great!

Huh? Is anyone listening?

Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it!

I've got a whole pile of potstickers!

Hold it!

Now!

So close!

Rats!

All right...!

Oh, you're sure in high spirits, huh?

--Hold it!
--I knew it! They really don't respect me!

He really is awesome, huh?

But he's not gonna get the best of me!

I'm so close...

That's it! All right!

Sure enough!

All right!

Hold it!

I did it!

I finally did it! I caught you!

He's as amazing as I thought.

He's already overcome the gravity here, has he?

He just might be able to master the Kaio-ken.

Get up, already!

Don't get cocky, just because you've
managed to dodge me once or twice.

You're still soft!

Help me!

Get back up here, by yourself!

Ten-san and Yamucha-san have
both become even more incredible!

Yajirobe, take this seriously!

Why, you...!

Yow-w-w-w-w-w!

I did it!

I did it, I did it!

Kaio-sama, what should I do next?

What should you do? Let's see...

--You're willing to do anything?
--Yeah.

Then how about grinding 
some sesame seeds?

Kaio-sama, I have to train
quickly, or the Saiyans will...

Hmph, don't be so hasty.
You still have 117 days.

That's no time at all!

What was that?

It's about time for it to come back.

Come back?

Here it comes...

That was great, that was great! Not bad at all.

Are you really all that strong?

How rude!

W-What was that?

Y-You look like a grasshopper, huh?

G-Grasshopper?

That's ridiculous!

--Ah, that was great!
--Y-You are ill-mannered.

My name is Gregory, and I look after Kaio-sama's personal care.

Kaio-sama, the one who governs all other deities in the universe...

"That's ridiculous!"

Ahem. You have some nerve, saying,

"Are you really all that strong?" to Kaio-sama.

There's a limit to how much ignorance I can stand.

But I ain't got a whip.

Son Goku, you show a lot of promise!

Kaio-sama, this is no time for you to be laughing!

This works out perfectly, Son Goku.

After Bubbles-kun, you will next be taking on Gregory there.

This guy?

What is that look on your face for?

I was hoping to get trained by Kaio-sama himself.

Kaio-sama, I am downright enraged!

I would like to take this fellow down a peg for taking me so lightly!

--May I?
--Very well.

What's that?

K-Kaio-sama, that's a little on the large side, isn't it?

Son Goku, here!

Well? Heavy, right?

Your next training is to swat Gregory using that hammer.

With this?

Once you are able to do that, I will train you myself.

All right, I'll try!

Hmph, as if a rookie like you could ever catch me!

H-He's fast!

Damn!

It looks like this is going to take a while.

Ow-w-w-w... All right, I'll get you this time!

Huh...?

That little jerk!

Hold still, you!

Wait up!

He wouldn't!

I-it's nice that's he's so high-spirited...!

I swear I'm gonna get stronger than the Saiyans!

Rats!

You have all far surpassed me.

There is nothing more that Mister Popo and I can teach you.

From here on, until the conflict is upon us, descend back down to the ground, and each of you hone your techniques.

The future is in your hands now.

Right!

Uh, so it's okay fer us to get outta these heavy shirts now, right?

Do as you wish.

Guys, let's get back down there and put the finishing touches on!

We should be able to power ourselves up even further.

We've all become amazing!

Goku, I can't wait to see what will become of you.

After two weeks of carrying the hammer...

Almost there!

He's relentless!

All right...!

Oh, no!

Say your prayers, Gregory!

I did it!

It'd hurt if I whacked you as hard as I can, after all.

Wishful thinking. My body is harder than even rock.

You won't be able to win against the Saiyans like that.

Oh, yeah? Then again, you've got a bump there.

Ee-yow-w-w-w!

There are still days left.

Knowing him, he might be able to master the Kaio-ken!

Kaio-ken, something I've dreamed about, but ended up never being able to master myself.

And also, that other surefire technique.

Kaio-sama, you promised.

You may think you're ready for this, but my training is even tougher than you can imagine!

Can you withstand it?!

Mm-hmm, I'll give it a try!

As long as you're aspiring to be something, be the best in the universe!
The best under the heavens!

Both in body, and in mind! Got it?

You got it!

Sis, I'd like you to tell the fortune of the Earth.

What's that? The future of Earth?

I want to know what will happen next year.

All right. I'll try divining it.

It's no use. This time, not even I can predict the future.

Oh, dear.

All right! That's it!
You're starting to control your Ki!

Weak!


Come Forth, Shenlong! The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth" 


This will be your final day of training with me.

Your punning studies may have come up a little short, but for the most part, I've taught you what I know.

Let's review what you've learned up to now.

Mm-hmm.

First up is Bubbles.

Ready...

Start!

Oh! 0.8 seconds! That's a new record!

Next, Gregory.

Right.

Ready... Start!

Okay... here goes!

Huh? Ow!

1.2 seconds.

Unbelievable!

Okay, next?

All right, finally, let's check your Genki Dama.

I've been waiting for this.

All right, ready, Kaio-sama.

Mm-hmm. Okay, here we go.

See if you can track the super speed of this giant brick.

Mm-hmm!

Here goes!

Okay, super speed!

Like it was nothing...

Well done, Son Goku. I honestly didn't think you would be able to handle the Genki Dama this well.

I worked hard on it.

Mm-hmm. It may sound like I keep repeating myself, but the Genki Dama is a technique that lets you take a small sliver of energy from the grass, the trees, people, animals, and every other conceivable thing, including the air itself, gather it together, and then release it.

Mm-hmm. It really is an awesome technique.

Even on a planet as small as this, the Genki Dama had that much destructive force.

Earth, where you'll be fighting, is much larger, compared to here.

Also, you'll have the tremendous energy of the Sun on your side.

Your Genki Dama will have astounding power.

If you're not careful, you could even destroy the very planet you're trying to protect.

If you can help it, don't use it.

If, and only if there's nothing else you can do, I give you permission to use it just once. Got it?

Mm-hmm, got it.

I'm sure I'll be able to manage with just the Kaio-ken.

Okay then, the day of your battle is almost upon us.

The Saiyans will arrive on Earth tomorrow.

Huh?! O-Oh, no!

W-What? What's the matter?

Uh, listen, I didn't calculate the time it will take you to travel the Serpentine Road to get back!

K-Kaio-sama, ain't you capable of whooshing me back to the lower realm?!

No, uh, I can't.

I-I've got to go back down that road?!

It took me over half a year to get here!

A-As you are now, you can arrive there in two days.

I'll tell Earth's Kami to pick you up there.

B-But I'll still be one day over!
Everyone will be killed!

Stop your griping! Even I make mistakes once in a while!

Now, hurry up and tell your friends on Earth to use their Dragon Balls or whatever to bring you back to life!

T-Tell them? But how?

Place your hand on my back, and speak in your mind.

It will get through that way.

Really?

Like this?

Mm-hmm, like that. Hurry and tell them!

O-Old Timer, it's Goku. Can you hear my voice? Hey, Old Timer!

Man, this girl is downright...

G-Goku? Is that you, Goku?
W-Where are you?! Where are you?!

He hears me! Old Man Turtle Hermit, I'm still in the Next World.

I'm speaking to you through my mind from a faraway place called Kaio's World.

T-The Next World?

Have you gotten all of the Dragon Balls together?

Y-Yeah. We've long since gathered them.

Everyone looked frantically for them so we could rescue you.

Thanks. So then, I hate to ask, but could you summon Shen Long, and bring me back to life right now?

The Saiyans will be getting to Earth tomorrow.

W-What?!

T-Tomorrow, already? That's a whole month earlier than we thought! Hurry, Old Timer.
I'll be just a little bit late, but I'll definitely manage something.

Hey, Goku...!

Er, I can't breathe!

Ah! Sorry!

A-All right, got it. By the way, Goku, what do you say?

We'd heard that you were training in the Next World.

Any luck with that?

Mm-hmm, you bet!

I-I see. That's a relief.

H-Hey, is he all right?

Old Man Turtle Hermit is talking to himself in the bathroom.

I wonder if he's going dotty.

Hey, get the Dragon Balls ready, right now!

That was awesome, Kaio-sama!
I got right through to him!

Naturally.

I can finally come back to life!

All right then, while we're waiting for you to come back to life, let me do something about that heavy, ragged outfit of yours.

Eh? Really?

Watch.

Awesome! it's lighter!

It's not just lighter. it's made out of a wonderfully sturdy fabric.

It can even repel minor attacks.

Thank you, Kaio-sama!

Wow, terrific! You left the "Turtle" mark where it was!

I was worried that if I had clothes like yours, Kaio-sama, I wouldn't look very cool.

Well, excuse me.

Ah, I hope they bring me back to life soon!

The mark on the back is the snazziest point on it, huh?

Hmm? Yeah!

What's wrong? You can't defeat the enemy by just dodging him!

All right!

Whoops, I got carried away. 
Was that a bit too strong?

That was no fair. You said you weren't going to use your eyes.

Don't be such a baby!

Do you think a promise like that means anything in a fight?!

B-But Piccolo-san, you're not the enemy.

Now, come forth, Shen Long!

It's the middle of the day, but it's suddenly dark out.

E-Excuse me, here...

Don't touch me!

N-No matter how many times I see it, it's still scary.

Speak your wish. I shall grant any one wish.

S-Say, um, I suppose we couldn't say we wanted him to dispatch the Saiyans, and save the Earth, could we?

What are you talking about? Are you thinking of keeping Son-kun dead?

I-It's not like that. it would be nice and easy to just have Goku brought back to life the next time, right?

That is an impossible wish.
I was created by Kami.

As such, I cannot grant any wish beyond Kami's power.

Well then, please bring Son Goku back to life.

That is an easy wish to grant.

Son Goku is about to be resurrected, huh?

Which means, the Saiyans will be coming sooner than we thought!

All right, the halo over your head has disappeared.

You have been brought back to life!

Hooray!

--Go on, hurry!
--Right!

Remember, your enemies are evil men, more powerful than you can imagine!

They won't let you drop your guard for an instant!

Don't go thinking you can be brought back to life again!

That's all right. The Dragon Balls can only bring you back to life once.

I'll give them everything I've got! Just you watch!

Mm-hmm.

Thanks for everything, Kaio-sama!

Once I die, I'll come see you again!

Bubbles!

--Gregory!
--Take care!

Bye, now!

Bye!

What unfathomable strength that man has.

And yet his heart is even clearer than crystal.

To think that there would be someone like him in the lower realm.

Kaio-sama, he has become even stronger than you, huh?

Still, his sense of humor wasn't that great.

The next time he comes here, I'll train him on that.

Oh, hush, you. Just hush.

Wow, so light, so light!

My body feels as light as a cotton ball!

Oh, right!

This ain't no time to be thrilled. 
I have to hurry!

And so, the next day at 11:43 AM......Earth at last allows the two Saiyans to trespass upon her.

Papa, I'm hungry.

Oh, is it already this late?

W-What was that?

What happened?

T-This is stunning...

It looks like something fell from the sky.

S-Sure enough. That round thing fell out of the sky.

There's one over here, too.

It's a person!

A person came out of it!

Over here, too!

It's a person!

W-What...?

So, the Saiyans are finally here.

They have an incredible Ki, huh, Piccolo-san?

T-Ten-san...

Tch, that was a lot sooner than we thought.

It's just about time for the Saiyans to arrive.

Hurry!

Guys, hold out for me!


Yamucha's Struggle! The Terrible Saibaimen"


W-Who are they?

What are they?

He called it Earth, right?
Not a bad planet, is it?

How about we say hello to the noisily peeping chicks here?

Go easy.

W-What was that?!

W-What the hell have they done?!

W-What the...!?

I-It's unheard-of!

That greeting may have come out a little too civil.

Leave it at that, Nappa. if you get too showy, we won't be able to sell this planet for a high price.

O-Oh, right.

Come to think of it, we have to look for those whatever-they're-called balls that can grant any wish, too.

Dragon Balls.

First thing to do is to find the one who killed Raditz, and get some information about the Dragon Balls out of him.

Yeah, right.

But if the Dragon Balls were in this area, our wish to gain eternal life just went up in smoke, all thanks to your mindless "greeting."

S-Sorry. it completely slipped my mind.

Well, what's done is done.

Now, let's look for the one who has the highest battle power.

That will be the one who killed Raditz, after all.

That's strange.

There are more than just one or two battle power readings over 1,000 .

Why would this planet have them?

Don't lose your cool.
They're still no match for us.

Let's just find the one with the highest battle power.

I've found him.

There are two fairly high readings together.

All right, Nappa, let's go have some fun with them.

The cause of this large-scale earthquake is still unknown.

Further, we are currently unable to make any contact with Metro East, thought to be the epicenter of this earthquake, and there is concern for the safety of its residents.

T-They've finally gotten here!

Shall we go to help? I can tell where they are with this.

Y-You'll get me to go over my dead body!

I-I'm going! I'm certain that Yamucha-sama will be going there!

No, we'd better not.

The difference in our levels is too great.

Even if I was there, I'd just be in the way.

All we can do is stay here and hope the others are victorious.

Son-kun, hurry back!

Hurry back!

Just hold out until I get there, guys!

This is great! This planet Earth has fairly little gravity, and I can just whip around!

They're moving at incredible speed!

They're heading straight for the place where those two other large Ki are.

They're coming! They intend to come here!

Right!

Chaozu, you stay here!

No way! I'm coming, too!

There's nothing to fear.

We've gotten so much stronger than we were a year ago, there's no comparison.

R-Right!

There's something coming from over there, too!

And there are others coming this way, too!

Are there more than just two Saiyans?

Is that a Saiyan?

Yo! Long time no see, Piccolo.

Oh, it's you.

What business do you have here?

Have you come so you could get in our way?

It looks like there are some other fools about to come here, as well.

Yeah, I'm sure everyone will be coming.

I was the one who was closest.

I remember! You're the one who was at the Turtle Hermit's place.

Yeah, I'm Kuririn. You've sure gone and gotten more beefy, huh?

Just like Goku, when he was a kid.

You're small, but strong, right?

That's what Father always used to say.

You're going to fight with us, right?

Goku said that, did he?

That's enough chit-chat. They're here!

There they are! There's one more of them.

Now there are three tough-looking guys here.

Apparently, they are well aware of who we are.

It looks like they've been waiting for us.

That's right.

Just for the record, let me ask you...

Why the hell are you here?

That voice! I see.

You're the one who killed Raditz, right?

Voice?

Didn't Raditz tell you?

These things work as communicators, too.

He's a Namekian.

So it seems. I guess it's not so surprising

that Raditz would have been killed by him.

Namekian?

Namekians, in addition to having above-average fighting power, are said to possess some mysterious abilities.

I-I'm a Namekian?

I've also heard that there are some of them that perform magician-like tricks. So that's it.

You must be the one who created the Dragon Balls, right?

T-They even know about the Dragon Balls?!

The Dragon Balls are our main objective.

Hand them over to us, nice and easy.

You may be a Namekian, but you and the others there are like bugs to us!

Thanks.

Because of you, I'm starting to get an idea of my ancestry.

But unfortunately for you,

I'm not the one who made the Dragon Balls!

I specialize more in fighting, you see.

Come and see if I'm like a bug to you!

Kami-sama...

I-I didn't know.

To think that I am an alien.

No wonder I thought I was a little different from everyone else.

Indeed, I was the one who created the Dragon Balls long ago.

But even though it was my first time making them, they seemed oddly familiar.

There was probably something that someone made on this planet "Namek," that were like the Dragon Balls.

Nappa, take off your Scouter.

What?

These guys alter their battle powers in response to their fighting.

These ratings aren't reliable anymore.

Come to think of it, you're right.

That weakling Raditz lowered his guard because of the Scouter rating, and got himself killed.

R-Raditz is that Saiyan that you and Goku teamed up on, and just barely managed to beat, right?

And he's a weakling?

I know. Let's have a look at these guys in action.

Hey, Nappa, we still have six Saibaimen, right?

Get them out.

Vegeta, you like playing around too, huh?

S-Saibaimen?

W-What are those?

There are six of them, all right.

This soil will grow some fine Saibaimen.

W-What are those?!

There.

T-Those guys are disgusting!

Your targets are those three.
Work them over, Saibaimen!

Gohan, don't lose your nerve!

Right!

You want us to start coming after you, now?

Kuririn!

Tenshinhan!

Chaozu, you came, too?

Mm-hmm.

I thought there were only two Saiyans.

Well, a lot has happened, and there's more of them now.

It's all the same, no matter how many of them there are.

Is that him? Goku's son?

Yeah. it looks like Piccolo has trained him quite a bit.

Kuririn, sorry I'm late.

Yamucha-san!

Everyone's here but Goku. 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...and 6. interesting. That's exactly the number of Saibaimen we have.

What do you guys say?

How about each of you fight our soldiers in turn?

It will be a game.

A game?! Rubbish!

Enough of your beating around the bush, let's settle this, right now!

Now, now, why not? it works out to our favor.

Goku isn't here yet, after all.

Fine with me.

I'll take you on first. Come and get me!

This guy is gonna be floored once he finds out how strong the Saibaimen are!

You go first. Hit him as hard as you can. Got it?

Gohan!

You got him!

That's our Tenshinhan!

Amazing!

I-Impossible! The Saibaimen's battle power is 1,200 !

They rival Raditz when it comes to power!

That just means that his battle power is higher.

B-But...

it's a simple miscalculation.

That's not what our data says!

Nappa, these guys look like they can provide us with a little entertainment.

V-Vegeta, how could you do that?

That Saibaiman underestimated his opponent.

I told him to go after him as hard as he could.

W-What a creep!

T-That Saiyan blew that monster to pieces in an instant.

What destructive force!

Well, who is next?

A-All right, I'll take you on!

Wait, Kuririn.

Y-Yamucha-san?

Let me go first.

I want to show them that we've had it with their playing around.

Yamucha-san, I could just as well--

You've already been brought back to life with the Dragon Balls once.

If anything were to happen, you couldn't be brought back again.

Let me take care of this.

I'm going to get rid of the remaining five all at once.

Such a lovely friendship we're seeing.

All right, you take him on.

Okay, come and get me!
Don't go taking us so lightly!

What is this weird uneasiness?

I've got a bad feeling about this.

Piccolo, find a way to hold out until I get there.

Please!

T-They vanished!

You fool! They're moving at high speed!

Sense out the movement of their Ki!

T-The movement of their Ki?

Everyone besides you can see them.

Eh? Everyone can see them?

All right...!

Use your whole body as your eyes.

Use my whole body as my eyes...

You see them?

I see them!

You're not getting away!

You got him!

A-Amazing...

H-He did it!

The earthlings have the upper hand!

He did it!

He did it, he did it!

Not again!

Hmph, it looks like these monsters aren't as strong as you think.

W-What did you say?!

Don't get excited, Nappa.

I'll take care of the remaining four myself, as well.

It looks like this time, you're the one who underestimated the Saibaiman.

What?!

O-Oh, crap!

T-This is bad.

Yamucha!

Yes. That's more like it.

W-What a monster! He blew himself up!

T-That's awful...

H-He's dead...

Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

Yamucha-sama!

Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

Yamucha-sama!

Y-Yamucha-san must have had a bad feeling about this.

T-That's why he went instead of me... Damn it...

Damn it! What am I supposed to tell Pu-erh and Bulma-san?!

What a pathetic Saibaiman! A draw?!

What did he think he was doing, against scum like that?!

Hey, get that filthy, tattered mess cleaned up.

D-Damn you!

Everyone, stand back!

Yamucha-san, I will make sure I avenge you.

Let me show you the results of my training!


Sit Tight, Chaozu! The Screaming Kikoho of Tenshinhan" / "Sit Tight, Chiaotzu! Tien's Screaming Tri-Beam!

Let me show you the results of my training! 

Go! 

What's with the slow-motion blast? 

You got them! 

Wow, amazing! 

Kuririn, are you okay? 

Yeah... but I missed one of them. 

To hell with you! 

That's Piccolo for you. 

Just thinking that he might be our enemy again gives me the chills. 

Thank you, Piccolo-san. 

Don't get the wrong idea. 
As if I would rescue you. 
I was just warming up for the wonderful fight that's about to begin. 

Let's hope that's how the fight turns out. 
Well then, as you wish, shall we put an end to the fun and games? 
The real battle is about to begin. 

I-Impossible! 

They aren't fazed at all! 
I hit them at full power! 
That's what Saiyans are like?! 

Let I take them. I'll finish off all five of them in an instant. 
Suit yourself. However... Don't kill the Namekian. 
We have to get information about the Dragon Balls out of him afterward. 
Okay then, do your best to make this entertaining. 

I'll start... ...with you! 

Let me handle this! 

Piccolo-san! 

It looks like this is going to be sort of fun. 

W-What? 

T-The whole ground is shaking... 

I-It's no use, Ten-san! 
My supernatural powers have no effect! 

T-This can't be! 

H-How can this be? 

I had no idea it would be this bad! 

Hurry! Hold on, guys! 

All right...! 

Chaozu, watch yourself! 

Tenshinhan! Dodge him.

Ten-san!

What fragile folks these are.

Now to finish you!

Damn you!

Tenshinhan-san!

Damn it! Tenshinhan!

Wait! He's had it! Let him be!

Shut up!

Stay out of this!

I can't see the bottom of the hole...

Unbelievable! What a tremendous energy wave!

D-Damn...

Nappa, look behind you!

--Chaozu!
--Why, you...!

You little punk!

Chaozu! Get away from him!

Chaozu, that's enough! Get away from him!

T-Ten-san...

Thank you...

W-What are you talking about, Chaozu?!

Get out of there! Hurry and get out of there!

I enjoyed being together with you.

Chaozu! What are you thinking of doing?!

Farewell, Ten-san. Please don't die.

Stop! Chaozu!!

Ten-san!

Chaozu!!

He blew himself up, taking them both out.

A pretty drastic thing to do.

Nice work, for the little guy.

That was a worthless thing to do.

N-No way! How can he still be fine?! That's terrible!

Chaozu even gave up his own life!

Chaozu... h-has already been brought back to life once with the Dragon Balls!

He can't ever be brought back to life again! Damn it!

I swear you'll pay for this!

It looks like you still don't realize how terrifying we are.

All that remains for you is death!

I-It had no effect at all!

Chaozu won't be able to rest in peace!

Chaozu...

Be grateful. I'll send you to see him in the next world, right away!

Y-You'll pay for this!

I swear you'll pay for this!

A-At this rate, Tenshinhan-san
will be done in as well!

I have to do something!

Stop!

We'll have a brief opening during the instant when he moves to attack.

Wait for that moment.

Got that, Gohan?

Yes...

That's a good strategy.

Best of luck with that.

Are you sure you should be looking away?

You'll miss your chance.

Heh, you sure are sure of yourself.

But you'll stop making that stupid face once Son Goku gets here.

Ho? Who's that? Your ace-in-the-hole?

Just you wait and see.

Looks like that's all for you, huh?

I'll come put you out of your misery, right now.

See you in hell!

Now! Scatter, Kuririn and Gohan!

Yeah!

I'm gonna finish you! Die!

What?!

Gohan! Now! shoot him!

Gohan!

Get yourself ready!

I-I'm too scared!

You filthy brat!

It's not working!

We missed him! Our timing was too late!

Now you've done it! You've just shortened your own lives even more!

Fine. I've decided to change the order that I kill you in!

Say your prayers!

I-I'm sorry... Uncle Piccolo...

What is wrong, Kami-sama?

Hmm, it would seem my life will only last a little longer.

Death... death is closing in on me.

You cannot mean...

Piccolo is going to be killed.

And so is everyone else.

W-What about Goku?

Hmm... l still don't sense his presence.

Goku, hurry!

Ch-Chaozu...!

We've always fought together...

...and now, you can't be brought back to life!

Ten-san... I'm sorry...

Chaozu...!

You were fools to upset me.

Now, which one of you will I toy with first?

I'll leave the Namekian just barely alive.

Have to get more about the Dragon Balls out of you, after all.

Chaozu... l will avenge you,

and then I will be coming!

I won't leave you there feeling lonely!

This is... this is my... last...

K-Kikoho!!

Oh, did he get him?!

Don't startle me like that!

I-It had no effect on him!

That monster! Is he immortal?!

C-Confound it...

Fool!

He could have just stayed down, but he used up all his power, and died for nothing.

O-Oh, no... not Tenshinhan, too...

This is horrible... it's a nightmare...

Everyone is dying, one after another...

Goku!! Get here, quick!!

Goku!!

Hurry!

Hurry!!

Goku?

Why do you keep saying--

Hold on...

I put another one of you away.
Now, it's your turn!

Let's get back on the ground and fight.

He's far better at fighting in mid-air than we are.

It'll be the same, either way.

Flounder about, flounder about!

Here goes!

--Here he comes!
--Father!

Nappa! Wait!

W-What?! Why won't you let me at them?!

Don't be hasty. There's a little something I want to ask them.

This "Son Goku" you keep talking about is Kakarrot, right?

That's right! So what if he is?!

To think that your last resort would be Kakarrot!

What good will he do once he gets here, when he didn't stand a chance against even Raditz?

He's not like he was before!
He's gotten much, much stronger!

Don't you go making light of Son Goku!

For all of that, he doesn't seem to be coming, does he?

Are you sure he hasn't gotten scared, and run away?

H-He'll be here! My father will be here for sure!

And he's going to beat you guys up!

That's some faith you have in him.

This should be interesting.
We'll wait until he gets here.

You're kidding, right?! Let's put these guys away, right now!

However, we'll only give him three hours.

We won't wait any longer than that.

This is ridiculous! I'm going to play now!

Nappa! Didn't you hear what I said?!

S-Sorry. I got a little carried away there...

That's the deal. You should be grateful.

You'll get to live a little while longer.

You can't blame him. This is his first real fight, after all.

Hmph! What a sap I am for expecting anything out of you.

Get lost, you pantywaist.

I have to say, though, the way that big guy was cowering just now...

Does that mean the runt there, Vegeta,

is even more ridiculously strong?

I'm aching to do something!
I can't wait any longer!

Now, hold on. Three more hours.

In three hours, we'll be witness to a hellish horror show.



Will Son Goku Be in Time?! 3 Hours Until the Battle Resumes"   


Why do we have to wait for Kakarrot?

Because he is a traitor to us Saiyans, and we have to inflict punishment on traitors.

We're going to kill his son and his friends, right before his eyes.

Afterward, we're going to serve him up as well, nice and slow.

We're going to show him how powerless he is, as he writhes in agony.

And in another three or four hours......we will be able to give him a fantastic, hellish show!

I get it! So that's it! That will be great!

That is, if he gets here in the next three hours.

You can have Kakarrot, but let me take those other three!

Suit yourself. However......do it after you get the information about the Dragon Balls out of the Namekian.

I sure hope Kakarrot does come.

Say, at this point, why don't we run away?

There's no way we can win.
This is no time to be stubborn.

You fool! Either way, they're planning to wipe out humanity.

We'll end up the same way even if we don't flee now.

D-Damn! Please, Goku! Get here!

Show them how much, much stronger than them you've become!

Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

Still not yet?

Guys, hang in there a little while longer!

Piccolo, Goku is sure to get here in the next three hours, right?

Who knows?

Think about some way to inflict even a little damage on them before Son Goku gets here.

P-Piccolo-san!

P-Please train me again during these three hours!

Don't act like a baby!

I have no need for pantywaists.
Go on and get out of here.

P-Piccolo-san...

Piccolo!

I've drilled everything into you.
You're more than just this.

Gohan! Come back!

Gohan!

Kid, are you trying to run away?

Not that that isn't the smart thing to do!

Who's running away?!

Your momma's belly button sticks out!

That little brat!

H-How did he know that my mom's belly button stuck out?

W-We're going to try to get as close to the scene as we can.

What on earth could be going on? 
I'm not certain of the details, but could it be that they are taking a time out?

Maybe I'll go have a little fun.

I can't just sit around here waiting for three hours.

Do as you wish. But Nappa, don't let it get too out of hand.

Why not?

For the sake of the hell show we'll be having in three hours.

Oh, right, Vegeta.

I'll keep it to just a friendly greeting. Don't worry.

One of the Saiyans has flown up into the air!

Where in the world could he be headed?

H-He seems to be headed in our direction, and is quickly drawing ever closer!

H-He's coming after us!

He's coming!

Swing the camera around!

R-Run!

You're a blight! Get lost!

By the way, has Goku not arrived yet?

Regardless of how funny my gag was, this is no time for laughs.

The fate of Earth is at stake!

Hurry, Son Goku!

I see it!

I'm almost there!

Goku's presence?!

Yeah. He's getting close!
He just might make it in time!

One more hour, huh?

Kakarrot isn't chickening out on us, is he?

It's all or nothing. It looks like that's all we can do.

He's here! Son Goku is here!

Kami-sama, quickly!

It's the end of the Serpentine Road!

T-That was fast! That was remarkably fast!

Hmm? There's a powerful Ki, divided into two! What's going on?!

And so, three hours pass without Goku showing up.

It's time.

Damn!

It appears that waiting for him didn't do any good.

He's still not here?

No, the coward Kakarrot has not come.

My father is not a coward!

Damn, why isn't he here?!

Son Goku...

Now then, to give them a thorough working over...it's too bad we won't be able to show this to Kakarrot.

There's only once chance for us to be able to beat this guy.

Of course, that assumes that everything goes smoothly.

Listen up.

First, Kuririn, you go after him and draw his attention as much as you can.

Then, I'll find an opening and grab his tail, the Saiyan's weak spot.

O-Oh, right.

Once he loses his strength, and can't move anymore,

Gohan, you wring out all the power you've got and charge him.

Right! I won't run away this time, so it will be okay.

Of course you won't. Remember that the fate of Earth is in your hands.

Gohan, have faith in yourself.
If you set your mind to it, your power is even greater than mine.

All right...!

--Goku!
--Kami-sama!

Hurry! Grab on!

If you please!

T-That kid really did make it back here from Kaio-sama's place.

Okay, I'm off! My training went great!

--We're counting on you!
--Good luck, Goku!

Mm-hmm!

Guys! Gohan! Please be alive!

Here he comes! Son Goku is quite exhausted!

Hey...!

Karin-sama!

My last two senzu beans! Here!

Thank you!

This really helps!

We're counting on you!

I'll use one right now!

All right, full strength!

Kinto Un!

Long time no see!

You're on!

There's an incredible gathering of Ki!

That way!

All right, here goes!

Ha! He's leading off by charging right at me!

Draw his attention!

Now!

W-Why, you!

Gohan!

You fool!

I-Impossible...!

P-Piccolo-san!

Whoa, don't go dying, now!

You still have to tell us about the Dragon Balls.

T-T-This can't be...!

Hell of a miscalculation, huh?

Did you think we would leave our weakness untrained forever?

That's a shame.

The best fighter on this world, reduced to this with just one blow!

P-Piccolo-san!

Shake it off!

Now then, while he's gone beddy-bye, I guess I'll play around with the little ones.

I'll start with Kakarrot's son.

Hey, you carry true Saiyan blood.

You're bound to offer me a little fun, right?

Hey, now, don't go croaking on me yet.
Play with me a little more!

That's the spirit!

You bastard!

Ho... his movements, at least, are something else.

Let me show you something I've been saving!

Kienzan!!

What a sorry technique!

Nappa! Dodge it!

That idiot! Couldn't he tell what kind of technique it was?!

Damn...!

W-Why, you...!

How dare you... how dare you cut my face?!

Get out of my sight!

I'll finish you!

You're awake already?

Y-You punk!

Looks like they're giving you trouble, Nappa!

Don't you... don't you look down on Earth, Saiyan!

Why, you! Now I'm furious!

I was going easy on you, since I can't kill you because of the Dragon Balls, and now you've gotten all full of yourself!

You're the one who's full of himself!

W-What is that Ki?!

There's a tremendous Ki heading here from far away!

I-It's true!

An amazing, yet familiar Ki!

N-No doubt about it... I-I can feel it...it can only be him! Son Goku!

Just a little farther, Goku. Hurry. Hurry!

It's Son Goku! Son Goku is coming!

I-I just knew he would come!
Damn that punk for keeping us waiting!

F-Father! Father is coming!

Hurry! Hurry!

G-Goku...

These guys have a strange power by which they can sense presences.

Is it Kakarrot? Let's see...

They're close! I can feel it!

Two huge Ki, and two even more huge Ki! There's one small Ki!

T-The numbers don't add up!
H-Has somebody died?!

Kinto Un, hurry even faster!

Vegeta, is what they're saying true?

Is Kakarrot really headed this way?

I don't know if it's Kakarrot or not, but somebody is going to be here in about four minutes.

Someone with a battle power of 5,000 !

- 5,000 ?! I-impossible!

Nappa! kill them!

If the four of them team up together, they could become a problem!

They'll also serve as an example for Kakarrot!

What?!

B-But what about the Dragon Balls?

No matter! I have an idea!

If we go to that Namekian's home world of Planet Namek, they're sure to have even more powerful Dragon Balls there! I thought it was just a silly story, but if Kakarrot has really come back to life, then the legend is true after all!

I get it. All right...

I'll start with you!

P-Piccolo-san! Run!

I'll keep him busy somehow until Father gets here!

What?!

After all, Piccolo-san, if you die, then Kami-sama dies, too, and the Dragon Balls will be...

What kind of nonsense is that?!

There's no way you can keep him busy all by yourself!

Don't make me laugh! You little brat!

No!

You brat! You're through!

O-Oh, no!

Die!!


Tears Shed by Piccolo... Son Goku's Furious Counterattack!" 
  

 I'll save you! 

I told you to run... 
Hurry , or else... 

Don't die! 
Father will be here soon,  and he'll beat them up! 
Please , don't die! 

That fool! 
My kill order has been changed,  but no matter. 
It's all the same either way. 

O-One of the Ki is growing smaller in a hurry. 
S-Somebody is dying! 

It looks like my life is about to run out... 
G-Goku didn't make it there in time... 
But at the very end, there,  Piccolo surpassed me,  as Kami... I'm so happy... 

Kami-sama! 

T-This is so pathetic... I-Imagine, Piccolo Daimao, of all people, p-Protecting a little kid... it's appalling... 

U-Uncle! 

Gohan, you're the only one who ever talked to me one-to-one. 

But Father said that after you were reborn, Piccolo-san, you don't seem to be as full-blown bad as you were before. I kind of think so, too. My mother and grandfather were afraid of you, though. 

That was no fair. 
You said you weren't going to use your eyes. 

Don't be such a baby! 
Do you think a promise like that means anything in a fight?! 

B-But Piccolo-san, you're not the enemy. 

T-This last year with you wasn't so bad... 

Uncle! Don't die now... 

G-Go... han... 

Uncle!! 

Mister Popo, I leave the rest in your hands... 

Kami-sama! Kami-sama! 

This should be good! 

You wanna go at it?!
Masenko!!

His Ki is incredible!
... 1,500 ...2,800 ...
Battle power 2,800 !
These guys can acutely alter their battle powers!

2,800 , huh?
That was a pretty incredible move, for a little kid!
My arm stings a little.

His battle power is dropping like a stone.
It looks like he used up all of his power on that one shot.

P-Piccolo-san, I'm sorry.
I was unable to avenge you.

Gohan! Run! Run away!

Kid, I'm sending you into the next world for sure this time!

I don't even have the strength to run away anymore.

I can't wait to see Kakarrot's face when he sees......his own son, smashed to a pulp!

K-Kinto Un?!

Father!

Goku!

So, you've finally shown up.

Why have you taken the trouble to come here, Kakarrot?

Don't tell me you've come to tell some ridiculous joke about how you're here to defeat us.

Piccolo...

Piccolo-san died protecting me.

Tenshinhan...

Yamucha...

Are you in shock at seeing all of your foolish, fallen comrades?

Come to think of it, there was another little runt, who got blown to shreds.

He had decent power, despite his tiny size.

So, Chaozu, too...
And Kami-sama, as well. Damn!

No need to grieve for them.
You'll be joining them, soon enough.

Here you've gone and come back to life, and you just nonchalantly show up here.

His battle power is rising fast.

What? You're ready to die already?

Accept this by way of greeting!

He's fast!

Gohan, this way.

--Kuririn...
--G-Goku...

Sorry I took so long.

I'm impressed you two made it through.

Here. Each of you eat half.

T-That's a senzu bean, isn't it?
Karin-sama still had some?

Mm-hmm. This is the last one.

Then you eat it.

It's all right. I had one before I got here.

No, you hold on to it, just in case.

Even if we recover now, we won't be any help.

Don't worry about it. if you don't eat it, I'll throw it away.

Here.

Thanks.

Gohan, you, too.

Mm-hmm.

Kuririn, you've improved incredibly, huh? I can tell by your Ki.

I thought I had, anyhow, but it's no use.

It didn't do any good against them. They're too strong.

I... I just watched as everyone else died around me...

Gohan, I barely recognized you, either.

You sure have trained hard.

Mm-hmm. Piccolo-san trained me.
But I wasn't able to do anything.

With Piccolo-san dead, we can never use the Dragon Balls again.

We can't bring anyone back to life.

Let's all three of us avenge them!
Goku, with you joining in, we might at least be able to get one of them!

Hey, Goku, you trained under some terrific guy named "Kaio," right?

Yeah.

But I'm going to fight them by myself.

You guys watch from a distance, so you don't get caught in the middle of it.

B-By yourself?!

You may be strong, Goku, but that's crazy!

Their strength is far greater than we can imagine!

H-He's right, Father!

G-Goku...

F-Father!

Let Goku handle this.

B-But...

I've never seen Goku filled with that much anger.

T-There's no room for us to intrude here.

What's with that face you're making? I don't like it!

You want me to kill you, just like that?

You're going to pay for this!

F-Father is incredible!

Battle power 7,000 ... 8,000 ...

impossible!

Vegeta, what has Kakarrot's battle power gone to?

More than 8,000 !

More than 8,000 ?! That must be some kind of mistake! A malfunction!

Don't you worry. I still won't use Kaio-ken against you.

Kaio-ken?

Shut up!

There's no way you can stand up against the great Nappa!

What?!

H-How did he do that just now?

W-When did you get behind me?

W-Why, you...!

For all your swaggering, you ain't all that great.

W-What did you say?!

I-I'm not all that great?!

That's right. I can tell from that attack just now.

Why don't you explain to me......exactly what it is you can tell?

Strange. it's as though his battle power is completely different from when he fought Raditz.

Over here!

D-Did you see your dad move?

Uh-uh. But it was amazing.

How can this be?

How did Kakarrot gain this much power in such a short time?

That one was for Chaozu!

Damn it!

This is for Yamucha!

Why, you......filthy little brat!

Ain't no need for me to even dodge this!

W-What?!

H-He countered it with just a ki-ai shout?

D-Damn you!

This one is for Tenshinhan!

H-How?! How can Kakarrot have this much power?!

What?!

And this one is for Piccolo!

Damn it!

A-Awesome! You really are awesome, Goku!

Yes!

Damn it all!

I see. You're incredibly tough. I'm impressed.

I am a highborn, elite warrior!

I will not be made sport of by a lower-class warrior like you!

I'll get you for this! I'll kill you!

You idiot! Cool your jets!

If you think it through rationally, you'll see he's not an unbeatable opponent!

Nappa, calm down!

Right... Thanks, Vegeta.

Thanks to you, my eyes have been opened.

Tch! Simple-minded fool!

At this rate, I'm going to have to take over.

It's true, all the blood had rushed to my head, but from here on, I'll show you my true colors.

Are you ready for this, Kakarrot?

That's more like it.
I'm looking forward to this.

Talk tough, will you?

He's not just talking tough.

He possesses assurance and absolute self-confidence.

G-Goku...

Father...

I see you!

Whoo! This is much better, ain't it?

This is better?

I'm gonna close that insolent mouth of yours for good!

This will finish you!

What a freak!

He struck back at that close range in that brief instant!

Whoa, if I had taken that one full-on, it would have been trouble.

I-Impossible! That was my greatest technique! You just brushed it aside!

You really are a tough bastard.

The Kamehame-Ha should have taken at least some toll.

If this keeps up, we ain't getting anywhere.

That's enough! Come on down, Nappa!

You're getting us nowhere!
I'll take care of him!

What?!

You're pathetic!

Imagine, me, actually having to take action against Kakarrot!

H-He's finally going to start in?

Even the big guy there is intimidated by him.



This is the Kaioken! The Critical Battle of Goku vs. Vegeta" 
  

D-Damn.

T-To think that I'd have to turn over your execution to Vegeta.

Orders are orders. I'll let Vegeta take care of you.

But I can't let it end with me withdrawing like this.

Crap! The other two!

It's no use! I won't make it in time!

Kaio-ken!!

What?!

Damn...!

He ain't able to fight anymore.

Take him, and get yourselves off of Earth, right now.

W-What was that just now?

For a moment, his speed and power shot up sharply!

G-Goku, how did you do that?

Is that a technique you learned from that Kaio-sama guy?

Yeah. it's called " Kaio-ken."

By controlling all the Ki in your body, you amplify it momentarily.

If you do it right, your power, speed, destructive force, and defensive force all multiply many times over.

T-That's awesome! As strong as you've become, you can still become many times stronger than even that?

--Yeah.
--Goku, you're such a tease!

This is no time to be playing around, right?

If you had that up your sleeve, you should have used it from the start.

Sorry, I couldn't do that.

If I don't control it while throttling my Kijust right,

I could really mess myself up.

Basically...

Just to press the point, at your level, you cannot use the Kaio-ken too heavily.

If your control slips up, you'll end up damaging your body.

Keep your power down to double, at the most. Understood?

Performing a Kaio-ken beyond that will put too great a strain on your body.

Put another way, your body won't be able to keep up with the Kaio-ken, and it will end up backfiring on you.

Mm-hmm, I got it.

And that's the story.

O-Oh...

V-Vegeta... h-help me...

T-Thanks...

Hmph, not at all.

W-What are you--

Vegeta! Vegeta!!

I have no need for a Saiyan who can't move!

W-What a Ki!

F-Father!

W-What's going on?!

Die!

V-Vegeta!!

W-W-What a monster!
He even killed his own buddy!

Gohan, Kuririn, the two of you go on back to the Kame House, right now.

R-Right.

Gohan, you heard him. Hurry, let's go.

B-But...

Gohan, he's too much for us.

We won't be of any help if we stick around here.

And our being here will just distract Goku, and make him worry over us.

Really, Father?

Sorry about that.

It looks like his strength is greater than I thought.

O-Okay, I understand.

Oh, yeah. Goku, as long as you're fighting, could you do it in another location?

It wouldn't do to let everyone's bodies here get all messed up, once we bring them back to life again.

Bring them back to life?

Piccolo is dead, so Kami-sama is dead, too.

The Dragon Balls are now gone forever.

I hate to say it, but they ain't ever coming back to life.

Yeah, I know that.

K-Kuririn-san, by any chance...

W-What?

I'll explain it all to you later.

That is, if you're able to beat him, Goku.

If I can beat him, huh? Yeah.

I have to beat him, at any rate, no matter what.

What are you waiting for?

What happened to all that enthusiasm you had a moment ago?

Have you lost your nerve and decided to huddle up and run away?

Okay then, well, I guess I'll change locations, and do my best.

In any case, let me handle this.

Goku, sorry about always having to leave our fate up to you alone.

Don't you dare go dying now, my good friend.

Yeah.

Father...

Gohan......after Daddy comes back home alive, let's go fishing together or something, okay?

Okay!

It looks like you realize that there's no use in running away.

We're going to change our battle location.

Suit yourself. it will all turn out the same.

Father...

I should have known as much.

He's following with confidence to spare.

Gohan...

Hey, Gohan!

--Yes?
--Let's hurry back to the Kame House.

Mm-hmm.

Let's stop worrying. We've turned over the fate of the Earth to him.

It'll be all right, Gohan. 
Goku is sure to take care of him.

Now, let's go. Hurry back and show your mother that you're all right.

Right!

Here should be all right. There ain't any people or animals around.

I see...

So this is the place you've chosen to be your grave, is it?

You should rejoice.

After all, a lower-class warrior like you is going to get toyed around with by a super-elite.

Soon after Saiyans are born, their capabilities as soldiers are tested.

The scum whose ratings are low are then sent to worlds without tough opponents, like you were.

In other words......you were an outcast!

And as a result, I was able to come here to Earth.

I should be grateful. Besides......maybe even an outcast can surpass an elite if he tries desperately enough.

That's a pretty good joke.

Well then, let me show you a wall that you will never be able to get over with effort alone!

What's the matter, Kakarrot?!
You can do better than that, can't you?!

You were giving more than this when you beat Nappa!

Let me see it!

Impressive. He ain't even taking this seriously yet, but his speed and technique are already beyond mine.

Show me, unless you've already used up all your strength.

All right! I'll show you!

Kaio-ken!!

If that was the limit of what you've got, I'm going to be very disappointed.

What a brute this guy is...

But then......for as much trouble as I'm in right now, I'm starting to get excited.

He's laughing? Has he given up hope, and turned defiant?

Or does he know he is capable of raising his battle power even higher?

Well?! Are you done already?!

That appears to be all you've got.

Well then, allow me to show you something before you die...

The overwhelming power of a super-elite Saiyan!

That disagreeable grin of yours is going to be wiped away soon enough.

What a Ki! it's as if the entire Earth is trembling!

It's a full-on typhoon!

The air has stopped quivering.

A-All of the clouds have been blown away.

It's over, Kakarrot.

You fool! Behind you!

Kaio-ken, times two!!

All right, nicely dodged.

I made that one easy for you to dodge.

It wouldn't be any fun if you died too easily.

Damn, what power and speed he has!

Not even my times-two Kaio-ken can keep up with him.

Ain't much else I can do, huh?

This may wreck my body, but it's better than dying.

I ain't got any choice but to raise my Kaio-ken to triple-strength.

I've already come so close, so there's no point in not checkin' them out, and what do I see?

That punk and Goku're both so strong, it's like I'm havin' a nightmare.

Now then, once I raise my Kaio-ken to times-three, I wonder how long my body will be able to hold out.

What's the matter, Kakarrot? Come and get me!

Either way, I've got no choice but to do it.

The way things are going, there ain't any way I can win.

Don't you have anything else up your sleeve?

Looks like you messed with the wrong guy.

Even among the other Saiyans, I was the most powerful man around.

No matter how much you may have trained, you're still just an outcast!

You've only put off the time of your defeat by a few moments.

This ain't good.

That Saiyan bastard has him completely overpowered.

Maybe I'd better get outta here while I can.

Uh-huh, I oughtta beat it.

It don't do no good for me to be here, nope.

May my body withstand this! 
Times-three Kaio-ken!!

N-No! You can't exceed double-strength, Son Goku!

Then again, as it stands, there's definitely no way he can win.

Imagine, that guy being so strong...

This battle... may be hopeless.

W-What's wrong?

H-Has something happened?

It's probably Son-kun, but this battle power reading

I-Is rising like crazy!

--Goku!
--Goku-sa!

17,000 ... 19,000 ... 21,000 ...

O-Oh, no...

W-What?!


The Impact of the Kamehameha! Vegeta's Tenacious Transformation"
  

Times-three Kaio-ken!!

Awesome, man...

Why, you...!

Y-You miserable...!

H-He's got 'im! He just might win this!

I-Impossible! How can his...

How can Kakarrot's battle power be greater than mine?

D-D-Damn, this guy is tough.
I have to settle this quick, or else...

S-shoot, my body...

I-I'm not going to let this happen!

I am a super-elite!

There's no way I'll be beaten by that lower-class warrior!

I am the best in the universe!

S-Sure enough, it looks like using a triple Kaio-ken is too much for me.

If this drags out too long, I'm the one who will be done in first.

Blood!

My noble blood has been spilled by that piece of trash?!

I-I won't allow it! No way... No way will I allow it!

Who needs this planet anymore?!

I'm going to blow you and all of Earth into tiny pieces!

You're gonna what?!

Go ahead and dodge this if you can!

You might save yourself, but Earth will be blown to pieces!

Damn, he thought this through!

I'll have to risk it!

A triple-Kaio-ken......Kamehame-ha!

Ka... me......ha...

There's no way you can stop my Gyallic-Ho!

...me...

I'll turn you and the whole Earth into space dust!

...ha!!

W-What?! It's just like my Gyallic-Ho!

Kaio-ken......times four!

I-It's pushing me back--

H-H-He did it! He did it!

Son! Ya did it, you magnificent bastard!

Yajirobe? What are you doing here?

What, you didn't notice?

For as strong as even you are, you sure did bust yer tail there, huh?

--Yeah, I guess.
--But then, way to send that awesome dude flyin'!

You sure are one helluva stud, there.

W-What? What'sa matter?

I-I used a technique that was too much for my body to take.

Oh, yeah? Well, it wasn't nothin' normal, that's fer sure.

Never mind me, Yajirobe, you should get out of here.

What for?

Y-You don't mean...

He's still alive. if that's all it took to kill him, it'd be too easy.

B-But it's no sweat, right?
You're the stronger one.

I told you, I overdid it, and now my body is falling apart.

I might be just about maxed out.

I-Is that right?

Well, then...

G-Good luck with that!

D-Damn it!

How?! How can Kakarrot's battle power be greater than mine?!

Damn it all! I am a Saiyan!

I am the strongest one in the entire world!

At this point, as much as I hate how ugly it is, it's time for my last resort-- to transform into a Great Ape, and crush him!

My strength as a Great Ape is overwhelming!

Damn it, I chose to arrive here on the day of the full moon so that we could wipe out the people of this planet quickly, but I never thought I'd have to transform just to defeat Kakarrot!

This really burns me up!

That's strange. it's well past time that the moon should be visible.

Saiyan, no matter how hard you look, it won't do any good.

The moon isn't there.

That Piccolo fellow was afraid something like this might happen, and got rid of it long ago.

Still, Goku can't have very much strength left.

Even if the Saiyan doesn't transform into a Great Ape, it doesn't change the fact that he's in trouble.

But then, he's growing weaker, too.

The Genki Dama! If you can hit him with a Genki Dama, you'll beat him for sure!

That's weird. He's just hovering around up there.

Why doesn't he come down after me?

It's gone! it's gone! it's gone! Damn it!

The moon isn't anywhere! How can this be?!

I get it. Damn it! That bastard is driving me right up the wall!

Kakarrot took out the moon before we even got started!

Now I've got no choice.

My battle power might drop a little bit, but it doesn't look like I've got any other option.

Ha, I can't wait to see the look of panic on his face!

He's finally coming back down.

The only way for me to beat him is with a Genki Dama.

Will I be able to focus enough?

Kakarrot!

You may have thought you were clever, getting rid of the moon, but it's not going to work!

The moon? What do you mean?

And now you're playing dumb.

Do you know why it is that we are able to transform when we look at a full moon?

Transform?

The light of the moon is that which is reflected from the sun.

It is only when sunlight is bounced back by the moon that it contains Bruits waves.

When the moon is full, those Bruits waves exceed a value of million zenoes.

What is this guy talking about?

Once at least million zenoes of Bruits waves are absorbed by the eyes, the tail responds to it......and the transformation begins!

There are a limited number of Saiyans that can artificially create a full moon that produces more than million zenoes.

Your gambit won't play out!
Despite getting rid of the moon, when the oxygen of this planet mixes with my Power Ball...

Sorry to keep you waiting, Kakarrot.

Your death is finally at hand!

A lower-class warrior shouldn't have challenged a super-elite like me to battle, anyhow!

The moment he produced that strange light, his Ki dropped.

What is he planning to do, that he would go that far?

What?!

Burst open and intermix!

W-What......is that? What have you done?!

Y-You don't mean...

H-He created a moon!

You're going to regret having lost your tail, Kakarrot!

'Ulp!

Is this the end?

W-What is that?

H-Hey, over there...

T-That's the direction we just came from.

What could it be? it's awfully bright.

T-This is impossible!

W-What is that? There's a tremendous Ki rising.

Father's Ki hasn't gone up again, has it?

N-No, this icky feeling is from the other guy.

And I have to say, his Ki is really something else.

What's going on?

F-Father...

Gohan...

I-I'm going back there.

I'm going back.

G-Going back? You mean, to where Goku is?

I-I just know that Father is in danger, and he's going to die if I don't do something.

What are you talking about, Gohan? Goku isn't--

There's no way your father is going to die, you know.

For one thing, even if we do go back, against a guy with a Ki like that...

Yes, I know...

Still...

I have to go! I'm sure of it!

H-Hey!

Wait up, Gohan!

What do you say, Kakarrot?

You're finished now!

W-What is going on here?!

A-A Great Ape? A Great Ape monster?!

I'm going to let you in on a little something.

The battle power of a Saiyan in his Great Ape form is ten times greater than before!

Goku, on the night of the full moon, a giant ape monster appears. 
You must not go outside then.

If you're asleep, you'll be safe.

I will fix it so that your tail never grows back.

It seems to be something of a nuisance, after all.

So that's it. I finally understand.

H-How can that be?

The monster that stomped Grandpa to death......and appeared at the tournament grounds, smashing them up......w-was me?

Forgive me, Grandpa.

This guy is ridiculously powerful.

Unless I use up all of my Ki, I doubt I have a chance of beating him.

Once I die, and go back over to the Next World, I'll come and apologize to you.

I'll show you, Vegeta!

I'm gonna cram a Genki Dama from me and the Earth right down your throat!

F-Father!

Goku... He's your son, all right.

K-Kaio-ken!

What's the matter?!

Can't you even run away?

Die!

What's the matter, Kakarrot?
Can't you deal with this?

A-As huge as he is, he's so fast!

There ain't enough time for me to focus to create a Genki Dama!

Not even a times-five Kaio-ken would work against him!

Hmph, you're not going to come at me?

In that case, I'll go after you!


Goku in Absolute Peril! Entrust Your Wishes to the Genki Dama"   


T-That's it!

Tenshinhan! I have to borrow your move!

Taiyo-ken!!

Now, while the brightness has blinded his eyes...

M-My eyes! My eyes!

A-All right. With this much distance...

T-The Land......the Seas......and... all living things...

Each of you, share with me just a little bit of your genki energy!

I beg you!

Damn it! What an insolent thing to do!

A-A little more... a little more, and I can create a Genki Dama...

W-What's he doin'?

He's starting to get his sight back.

Still, at this distance,

I'll be able to launch my Genki Dama before he can attack.

Damn it, where are you?!

Where are you?!

Where did you go?!

It's no use trying to escape!
I can sense your presence!

The genki energy is collecting!

Why, you...!

He found me! Please, let there be enough time!

I-It's done! I've collected the genki energy of the whole Earth!

--All right!
--Take this!

W-What was that?

What happened?

I-I never expected him to attack like that...

I-I really misjudged things...

Good grief, the Genki Dama I worked so hard to make is now gone.

Hmph, you're one tough bastard.

But then, you look like you've almost had it. I can tell.

He's got me. Now, I ain't even got a prayer of beating him.

I used up nearly all of my Ki on that Genki Dama just now.

Well, what will you do now?!

Goku's Ki is falling off, fast!

F-Father!

Hurry! We're almost there!

Whoops! Sorry, sorry!

Looks like I accidentally stepped on you, crushing your leg.

Well, this time, let me accidentally crush your heart!

This is the end for you, Kakarrot!

Even if you come back to life again, this planet won't be here when you do!

D-Damn it, he's completely beaten me.

I never imagined there'd be such a gap in power between us.

I'm glad there's someone this strong out there, but if I'm dead, it's just frustrating...

Hmph, die!

That's my last, parting shot...

I-I ain't even got enough strength left to blow my nose now...

D-Do what you will with me...

Why, you!

Kakarrot, how dare you...

How dare you scar my face?!

I'm going to squeeze you to death!

He's in a tight spot! it's no use now, he's dead!

It ain't like I've abandoned you, okay?

T-There's nothin' I can do, after all.

Don't go holdin' it against me.

Suffer good and hard, then die!

We're close! They're right over there!

Because of that weird ball of light, it's still this bright out, even though it's the evening.

What in the world is that thing?

K-Kuririn-san! Over there!

Get down, Gohan! Descend, and hide!

W-What is that?

Hurry, you dumb-ass!

I-It's those guys!

It can't be! He's turned into a Great Ape!

It felt like most of your bones broke just now.

Does it hurt? Eh?

Goku is getting killed. This is bad!

--This way!
--Right!

--Hey!
--Yajirobe!

Hey, who d'ya think that monster is?! it's the Saiyan!

I know.

There ain't no way you can go up against that monster! Stay put!

I know that, too.

But if we cut off his tail, he'll go back to normal.

--His tail?
--His tail?

Listen, Gohan, you and Yajirobe swing around in front of him, and draw his attention.

I'll wait for an opening, and cut off his tail from behind.

Hurry! Goku is gonna die!

R-Right!

H-He's gotta be kiddin' me! Draw his attention?

You guys might not know 'bout this, but even at his normal size, he's still unbelievably strong!

Father, don't die!

Goku's Ki is all but gone!
Damn it, he's about to die!

Father! Don't die!

There's someone there!

--Where are you?!
--Down here!

Let my father go!

Ho ho, this is a surprise. if it isn't Kakarrot's kid!

I get it, you came here just to see your father's last moments, huh?

Good timing! He's right at the point of death.

I was just about to finish him off.

Kienzan!!

Watch closely, now.

I'm going to crush him until there's nothing left.

Kuririn-san, hurry!

Unfortunately, it looks like he's already lost consciousness.

I-I-It can't be...!

Did you really think I wouldn't realize

that there was another one of you here?

You guys seem to enjoy worthless sentimentality, after all.

I figured this kid wouldn't just come wandering back here alone, so I was keeping an eye on the situation.

Apparently, you knew about our tails. Too bad, though.

Just you wait! After I'm finished with Kakarrot, you'll be next.

D-Damn! What a freak! Even as a monster, he's still level-headed, and on guard.

I'm sorry Goku. I hate to just stand by and let you die, but this guy's Ki is too great.
I can't even get close!

Your mistake was to try to challenge me to battle!

Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

Stop it!

Oh, you want to die before your father, do you?

O-Oh, no!

What's the matter? Too scared to move?

Leave me outta the rest of it!

D-Damn it! I-l didn't know there was another one of you!

M-My tail!

I-It's cut... His tail has been cut off!

You did it, Yajirobe!
He's gone back to his original size!

W-Why, you miserable...!

You want to die so badly, you'd make me mad?!

W-What's going on? Why did that monster...?

In that case, as you wish, I'll kill you, you trash!

Gohan! Run!

I'll start with you!

A Saiyan half-breed is strong, right?!

Show me your true power!

Heh, maybe there's been a change in the order.

Now, get up! Amuse me a little more.

Hey, what is this? Is this all you've got?

Does that mean the child of scum is scum, as well?!

You may be scum, but at least your blood is still red.

Want me to at least let you die next to your father?

I can be gracious.

Here!

G-Gohan...

Ho, Kakarrot, you're a tough one.
You're still conscious, are you?

Gohan, Daddy's all busted up on the inside...

I-I can't move...

Y-You have to fight in my place...

His power has to have been reduced significantly...

I-I can't, Father.

H-He's too strong. I can't beat him.

All right, this is the order I'll go in:

First, I'll kill Kakarrot. Next, Kakarrot's kid.

After him, I'll finish off that bald-headed bastard from earlier.

And lastly, the one that cut off my precious tail!

He remembered 'bout me!

Y-You don't have to beat him...
J-Just keep him at bay...

Your power should be much better than this... much better...

And then, I'll have Kuririn finish him off...

I can't do it. I can't move anymore, either.

You jackass! Do you want everyone else's death to be in vain?!

What did Piccolo teach you?!

I'm counting on you, Gohan...

G-Gohan...

Give me trouble, will you?!

You're nothing but outcast scum!

S-Stop... that...

Stop that!

What?

I'm going to......defeat you!

Hmph, you are going to defeat me?

What?!

Kuririn! Kuririn, please! Come here!

Damn it...

Don't you mess around with Vegeta!

Goku, this is impossible. He's just too strong.

Why didn't you tell Gohan to run away?

K-Kuririn, I'm going to give you this, before it's too late...

The Genki Dama I've collected from the whole Earth...

W-What did you say? What are you giving me?

A G-Genki Dama. A little Ki I've gathered from all over the earth...

About half of it has gotten away, but the way he is now, I still think it's enough to defeat him...

W-What?

Kuririn, hold onto my hand...

I-I don't understand any of this.

Hurry! Gohan is gonna die!

Y-You just want me to hold onto your hand?

Please...

Like this?

Your arm is broken, isn't it?!

Just like that. Don't let go.

I'm giving it to you... Take it...

W-W-What is this?

I-I-It's incredible! it's an incredible amount of Ki!

T-Take it, and focus it above your palm... it will create a ball...

You filthy brat!

Hang in there... Gohan ain't able to control this kind of Ki...

T-There it is! This is a......Genki Dama. Y-You did it...

Pesky brat!

Kuririn... hit him with it...I can't make another Genki Dama...

Y-You've got to make sure you hit him... Please...

A-All right. I'll try.



Dragon Ball Z Kai 

The Invincible Vegeta Defeated! Son Gohan Summons a Miracle" 
  
How strong he is...! 
He should be fairly worn out  from fighting Father, too... 

He 's quite the little runt,  but he seems to be just about at his limit. 

Masenko !! Ha! 

Is this your last-ditch defiance?! 

Rats! 
One more! 

Damn... With him moving around like that,  I don't have the skill it takes to hit him. 

You don't aim the Genki Dama using your eyes.  
You feel out the evil of his Ki, and then launch it. 

W-Who's there?! 

I am Kaio,  the one who taught Son Goku how  to use the Genki Dama. 

K-Kaio-sama...? 

Everything will be determined by your one shot.  
Know that the hopes of all the Earth are placed in  that Genki Dama. 

T-The hopes of all the Earth are placed in here? 

No matter how many of you scum team up,  you're still no match for an elite like me! 
Once you realized that, it was already too late! 

Feel out the evil of his Ki, then launch. 

I get it. 

Kuririn... I'm counting on you... 
You will only get one chance with this. 

I'm through playing around. 
Can you get away from this?! 

F-Feel it! Feel the evil of his Ki! 

He's fixin' to do somethin', huh? 
That's a huge wad of Ki. 
Well, if yer gonna do it, do it already! 

Watch this closely, Kakarrot! 
This is the end of your foolish son! 

I've got it! 

What're ya doin', dumb-ass?! 
Hurry up an' chuck that thing! 

That idiot! 
Damn it all! 

W-What is that?! 

Hit him! 
It missed!

It's hopeless now!

Bounce it back, Gohan!

Gohan, that thing is friendly fire!

If you ain't got any evil in you, you should be able to repel it!

They did it!

Yahoo!

We did it!

We did it! We did it, Goku!

Thank goodness! Goku!
We did it! We did it! We did it!

You guys finally did it, huh?

Mm-hmm.

I thought we'd had it, time and again, there.

You guys have both been run ragged.

Not as badly as you've been.

T-The Saiyan...

it's okay. He's dead.

Damn you. You were one hell of a beast, but I guess we should at least dig a grave.

You mean a grave for yourselves?!

T-T-That's impossible! He took that Genki Dama dead-on!

You've gone and done quite a number on me.

Even I thought I was going to die from that one.

I-I've taken a considerable amount of damage, but I still have enough strength to take care of trash like you.

Once I've killed you all, I'll wait and recover my strength, then completely destroy this planet!

Y-You've made me, Vegeta, use up nearly the full limit of my power.

And though it may have taken a number of you to do it, it wounds my pride that trash like you have done this.

Would you people drop dead already?!

D-Damn it... Damn it...!

G-Goku!

D-Damn it, I have to admit, that destructive force was pathetic.

All three of them are still clinging to life.

T-The damage was worse than I thought...I-I have to hurry up and take care of these guys......and then get some rest...

T-The little brat!

His tail has grown back!

H-His tail? Oh, yeah.

Way back when, Goku's tail also grew back all of a sudden.

Oh, crap!

If he were to transform on me, it would be trouble.

W-What?!

I done it! I done it!

Serves ya right, you jackass!

Nyah-hah-hah-hah!

How d'ya like that?! Yer no match for Yajirobe! Nyah-hah-hah!

Why, you...

You filthy bastard!

S-S-Sorry! Did that hurt? I-l was just kiddin' around! Did I cut ya?

Yeah! I got lotsa respect for you.
L-Let's you an' I be buds--

Y-Yajirobe...

Nobody, and I mean nobody wounds me and gets away with it!

D-Damn it...

G-Gohan!

Gohan!

T-That's Father's voice...

G-Gohan, listen to me...

Mm-hmm...

Look at the ball of light in the sky
...B-Ball of light...? Ball of light...?

O-Oh, no! I won't let that happen!

Die!

Oh, crap!

Y-You little brat! I'm not about to let you grow huge!

Damn!

I have to kill him, now, while I can!

G-Gohan, it's up to you...!

G-Gohan is turning Great Ape...it's an all-or-nothing gamble...

T-That's right, his tail!

I was in such a rush, I forgot the most important thing!

If I can just cut off his tail...

Gohan...

Then again, when Goku became a Great Ape, he had no trace of rationality.

What about Gohan...?

Gohan is the same way!

R-Right, it's not so much that Goku and Gohan lose their rationality, as it is that when they turn Great Ape, they revert to being violent Saiyans!

Wah! Stay away!

Gohan!

G-Gohan!

G-Gohan! The Saiyan!

Get the Saiyan!

W-Why, that...

Gohan!

Good! A small part of Gohan's mind still remains in there.

S-Sure, he's half earthling, after all.

The moon I created won't go out for another hour.

Sure enough, my only choice is to cut off his tail!

D-Damn! My power...!

Damn it!

I can't move!

W-What happened?

Did he get him?

H-He's still alive?

What is that?

There it is...

To think that I'd have to retreat...

D-Damn it, I, Vegeta, said to be the mightiest warrior in the universe...

T-That's his spaceship.

Like hell you're getting away!

We've come this far...

Now I'm gonna finish the job.

Hold it!

This is for everyone you've killed!

Say your prayers!

Damn it, my body won't respond...!


Dawn of the Fierce Battle... The Star of Hope Is Piccolo's Homeland
  

You've outdone yourselves to come this far.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out.

I'm not supposed to take sides, but that Saiyan was a villain who plunged the whole universe into terror.

I couldn't help it.

This doesn't mean that the root of this evil has been completely eliminated, though.

Not the root of it.

Die!!

Wait!

G-Goku?

W-Was that you who just spoke inside my mind, Goku?

Yeah, that's right. I can't talk very loud, after all.

K-Kuririn, forgive me for asking, but would you let him live?

A-Are you out of your mind, Goku?
This guy killed our friends, and was going to kill everyone in the world!

If we let him go now, he's sure to recover his strength, and then come back here!

Y-You're probably right.

If you're thinking that maybe he'll have a change of heart, the way Piccolo did, then you're greatly mistaken!

He's not like that!

I-I know. I know how ridiculously strong that Vegeta guy is, too.

Still, although I ain't able to explain it too well, s-seeing him there, about to die, made me think...

"What a waste."

W-What a waste?

A-After training at Kaio-sama's place, I thought I had reached my peak.

B-But that Vegeta guy there had far surpassed me.

It surprised me. To be honest, I was overwhelmed.

But then, somewhere in my heart, I was happy and excited.

Must be because I'm a Saiyan, too.

Whenever I see anyone strong, my heart leaps.

I know this is wrong, but please......give me another chance to fight him.

All right. You do have the right to ask for your own way.

It's because of you, Goku, that we still have the Earth that we do.

But you listen to me, Goku!

You take care of him next time with devastating power!

Yeah... I'll be sure to...

Remember this well, you trash.

There won't be any more miracles.

The next time we meet, I'll kill you all...

You can look forward to that.

Damn it...

Are you okay?

You can rest easy, now.

He left, eh?

I gotta wonder, why didn't that peabrain......finish the guy off?

Sorry about that, Kuririn.

Don't worry about it.

It didn't seem right doing that to everyone who died, but then again, it just might be possible to bring them back to--

H-He couldn't be...!

Hey! Hey!

Gohan-chan!

Ch-Chichi?

Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

Gohan-chan!

Ch-Chichi...

Gohan-chan!

Huh...?

Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan! Are you okay?

Wake up! Your ma is here!

Gohan-chan! What an awful mess you've been through!

G-Gohan is fine.

Goku is in far worse shape than he is.
You see? You see? Over there.

You poor thing, bein' forced to go through this!

You're never leavin' your ma's side again!

You poor thing! Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

That's just not right.
Goku had a rough time of it, too.

S-Son-kun...

--Goku...
--Son-kun...

Are you okay, Son-kun?

T-This is brutal.

S-Sorry, I let the Saiyan get away.

Oh, no, just being able to drive him off is quite an accomplishment.

Karin-sama...

C-Calling him strong doesn't begin to cover it.

B-Bulma-san... Yamucha-san and everyone else besides us four were killed...

Mm-hmm, we were watching it on  TV.

B-But with Piccolo dead, Kami-sama is also...

That's right. Which means, the Dragon Balls, as well...

I know that much!

You knew, didn't you?

Y-Yeah.

If only Piccolo were one of the ones who survived...

Well, excuse me fer livin'.

That's right! All you did was run around! You didn't fight one bit!

W-What was that, ya big--

A good-for-nothing jerk like you ought to just die right now, and take Piccolo's place, you idiot!!

If it wasn't fer me, these guys wouldn'a survived, neither!

Yer really burnin' me up!
No more Mr. Nice Guy fer me!

All right, all right!

Forget about that, we have to hurry and get the injured to a hospital.

I don't have any more senzu beans left.

Easy, easy... easy, now...

Gohan-chan...

The others' bodies are around here, right?

Um... a little farther that way.

Bulma-san, don't cry. T-The chances of this might be extremely slim......and maybe a little bit ridiculous......so listen, but don't get your hopes up.

There is a chance that those who were killed by the Saiyans can be brought back to life again.

W-What do you mean?

Really?

It's kind of a nebulous idea...

K-Kuririn, now that you mention it, you said something about that to me, too.

What do you mean by it? Tell us.

T-The truth is...

H-Hold on a minute. I'll tell you later.

Muten Roshi-sama, land here.

We have to get everyone's bodies aboard.

Mm-hmm.

Over the Star

Taking wing

like a shooting star across the sky

Watching over you from here

T-There isn't one.

He blew himself up, into little pieces.

Spanning the distance

Good grief, how awful.

Let my prayer find its way to you

I really do wish we could bring them all back to life.

You're the Star

The way things stand, their sacrifice has been too great.

You can see the blue earth, can't you?

Karin-sama, all I feel is anger......over my own powerlessness.

Calling to you, far away, from the heart transcending time

Let my prayer find its way to you
Let my prayer reach the skies

O-Okay.

Gohan-chan, are you awake?!

Relax! it's Ma! it's your ma!

M-Mother?

You poor thing! What a terrifyin' ordeal!

But you're all right now!

Yes, well done. Outstanding!

We made it through!

How? Where's the Saiyan?

He ran away. He got away from us.

B-But then, we all gave him a real thrashing, right?

He might not ever come back.

Where's Father?!

I'm in the back, Gohan.

I somehow managed to survive, thanks to you guys.

Hey, that's all fine an' all......but yer Goku's wife, right?
Quit just worryin' 'bout the kid, an' start lookin' after yer husband some.

H-How rude! No way!

It's because of Goku-sa that Gohan-chan suffered so!

There was no reason to drag my boy into this!

That's not true, Mother. Father was--

I am far more worried about Gohan-chan's future than I am worried about the Earth!

Goku, is it okay if I slug her?

Kuririn, would you tell us about what you meant earlier?

O-Oh, right. Mm-hmm.

The Saiyans seemed to know that there were Dragon Balls here on Earth, probably through Goku's brother's radio.

They also knew they granted wishes.

So, as long as they were here, they were going to obtain the Dragon Balls, too.

--Really?
--Yeah.

But when they saw Piccolo's face, they said something strange-- that he was a "Namekian."

Apparently, Piccolo was an alien.
And Kami-sama, too, I guess.

That ain't so surprisin', given his face.

The critical thing is what came next.

Nappa! kill them!

B-But what about the Dragon Balls?

No matter! I have an idea!

If we go to that Namekian's home world of Planet Namek, they're sure to have even more powerful Dragon Balls there!

Feh, that's what they said? Big whoop.

I heard them, too!

They said the Namekians had the power to create mysterious balls.

If-- and that's a really big if--we were able to go to this Planet Namek, we might be able to get our hands on those Dragon Balls.

I get it.

If you did that, those who were killed could come back to life!

Piccolo-san could come back to life!

G-Gohan-chan! How can you say that?!

Exactly! If Piccolo came back to life, so would Kami-sama!

Which would also mean the Dragon Balls here could come back!

--Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!...
--T-That's amazing! T-Then maybe, possibly, this could work!

Couldn't it? Couldn't it? Couldn't it?

Things are so simple to you laymen, huh?

There's no way we could achieve such a pipe dream.

What a bummer.

Not even you can do it, Bulma-san?

For one thing, Kuririn, how are we going to find out where this whatever-it's-called planet is?

L-Leave that to me.

Kaio-sama, you heard, right?

Do you know where this Planet Namek is?

Planet Namek? Of course I know where it is.

Whatever else anyone says, I am Kaio, after all.

T-This is incredible! We can all hear him, too!

S-So this is Kaio-sama, is it?

Kaio-sama, it sounds like everyone else can hear you, too.

Tell us where it is.

Hmm, Planet Namek's location...The way you folks on Earth would put it... let's see...Bearing SW by... no, er......let's see here... bearing SU ......by, let's see, YX, is it?

... YX, you say?!

B-Bulma-san, did you understand that just now?

H-Hey, Kame-chan, take over.
I have to calculate something.

K-Kame-chan?

The thing is, Planet Namek was once an extremely beautiful world, but as I recall, a good while back, they had an awful climatic aberration, and I thought that all of the Namekians died out.

Then that does it. Ain't no way there's any Dragon Balls.

H-Hey, you!

Now, don't panic. Once I check up on Planet Namek, I'll know for sure.

Where was it, again? Let's see now...

Oh, this way?

It makes sense. So Kami-- I mean, the Namekian who would become Kami-- escaped there and came to Earth.

The fact that Kami himself forgot about it means that he either lost his memory, or that he was just a little child at the time.

Either way, he had a sad past.

Even so, the Dragon Balls can grant any wish, right?

So the guys that made 'em coulda just said, "Stop this abnormal climate," couldn't they?

That probably wouldn't have worked.

Shen Long said that he couldn't grant any wish that was greater than the power of the one who created the Dragon Balls.

That means he couldn't rein in such terrific power.

That's why even Shen Long couldn't do anything about the Saiyans.

Oh, ya don't say. The Dragon Balls ain't all that great, then.

You've got a smart mouth!

Oh, there they are!

There are Namekians! There are no more than a hundred of them, but they survived, and are flourishing again!

There're a hundred of them guys?!

Not to worry. By nature, Namekians are a very gentle race.

Just like the guy that used to be Kami on your planet.

What became Piccolo Daimao was probably brought about by the influence of the evil in earthlings he encountered before he became Kami.

Yeah, that tracks.

There're some pretty small-minded folks out there in the world.

Look who's talking.

Still, this means there's a chance that Kami, not to mention Yamucha and Tenshinhan, can come back to life!

--Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
--Naive! You guys are so naive!

Sure, we may know where this Planet Namek place is. However, how are you thinking of getting there?

How? Well, in a spaceship, of course.

And I'm telling you, that's where you're being downright naive!

I just calculated the time it would take for a spaceship, using the world's best engine, built by my dad, to arrive at Planet Namek, just to see what it was.

A real whopper of a number came back. See?

347, years and three months.
We'll have to live an awfully long time.

As far as that goes, I think we'll be all right.

I was thinking of using the spaceship that Saiyan came in.

I got a look at Vegeta's spaceship, and it was so small, any way you look at it, it's a one-seater.

Which means that the other, dead Saiyan's spaceship has to still be out there somewhere.

Y-Yeah! The spaceship my older brother rode here in, too!

Ah, come to think of it, that one got smashed up by Gohan.

Even so, there's still one of them, right?

Once I find that one and analyze it, I might be able to manage something.

It's probably somewhere around Metro East.

That was the first area destroyed by the Saiyans.

We'll have to go look for it later.

That's what I was thinking, and picked up a neat little item.

This. I know I saw Vegeta beep this and call his spaceship in.
I'm sure it's a remote control!

This could work! This could really work!

All right! All right! Hope is in sight!

Planet Namek or bust!

Yeah, right!


The Spaceship that Sleeps in Yunzabit! Blast Off for Planet Namek"
  

"Son Goku"
"Son Gohan"

Man, we sure were lucky, huh?

They say that Gohan and I need to stay here for three days, and then we'll be good as new.

Ooh, you've got me beat.

They told me it would take four months for my injuries to heal.

They also said I might not ever be back to normal again.

Hey, you've got nothing to worry about.

In another month or so, some new senzu beans will be ready.

You know, you look just like a mummy.

And after the punishin' I took, they ain't even admittin' me.

Yeah, when Yajirobe was about to get pounded by that Saiyan, he was all like, "I'm sorry!

I really respect you! Let's be friends!"

Why, you! I'll knock yer block off!

I just did that to get him off guard!

Anyway, you all really did good.

Nothin' could make me happier.

Plus, it looks like the ones who died will be comin' back to life.

Hey, guys, guys, the  TV! Look at the  TV!

Oh, it's you, Bulma.

I thought you might have been a funny-looking nurse.

You just hush! Here, watch the TV.

This object, which was discovered in the devastation of Metro East, appears to be a vehicle from space, though that cannot be confirmed.

That's it! That's the Saiyan's!

--I know, right?
--I-I can't see!

Reports are that at the time of the discovery of this object, there were apparently two of them, but one of them suddenly flew away from the site.

This isn't good. Those scientists have already carried it away.

This will be fun, won't it?

Let's use the remote control that Kuririn brought along and call that thing over here.

I'm sure it will surprise them.

Are you sure that's a good idea?

What are you talking about? I'm a genius.

I spent last night examining this thing. Watch this!

Okay, beep, beep, beep...

Ready? Here it goes...

I wanna see, too!

T-The object has suddenly exploded!
What could have happened?

There is wreckage from the object scattered all over the place!

W-Why?

Could that have been the self-destruct button?!

What do we do?! Without that spaceship, we can't go to Planet Namek!

Our last hope......completely wiped out.

It's hopeless now.

This is what happens when you find strange remote controls!

Bulma-san, you're the one who pushed the buttons indiscriminately.

Hey.

Hi.

Mister Popo!

Somebody come with me. There is spaceship.

A spaceship? For real, Popo-san?

Probably.

W-Who is that?

That's Mister Popo.

Mister Popo?

He stays with Kami-sama up at his place.

But he's been up there at Kami's palace much, much longer than the current Kami-sama.

Say, what do you mean, "probably"?

It probably......spaceship. But Mister Popo not quite sure.

Somebody come along, examine it.
Mister Popo lead way.

Bulma-san!

Me?!

Well, Bulma-san, nobody else here knows anything about spaceships.

Bulma-san?

A-Are you sure this guy is all right?

Isn't there something dodgy about his eyes?

E-Easy...

We're counting on you, Bulma.

Be careful with me as we go, now.

Okay, we go.

Gently... gently, now...

Here we are.

Huh? Already?

Get off.

Where is this place? it's pretty cold here.

Yunzabit Highlands.

Yunzabit?!

That's the other side of the Earth, you know!

We came all the way here in that one instant?

Where was it...?

This way?

J-Just a minute!

Hey, you mean there's something like a spaceship around here?

Hey, are you listening to me?

You haven't brought me to this godforsaken place in order to do something pervy with me, right?

--H-Hey!
--Come quick.

Y-You're kidding, right? I can't do that--

Geez...

This.

Is this spaceship?

I'll have to look closer.

W-What is this? it's not metal. Is this...

Hey, what's going on here?
Tell me what on earth this thing is.

About years ago, Kami-sama told Mister Popo about past.

When Kami-sama was child, lived here in Yunzabit.

Mister Popo asked him, "Yunzabit is remote land. Nobody live there.

Why you live in that place?"

I don't know why I was in that place.

Apparently, I bumped my head, and all of my memories up until then were lost.

Had no parents?

No, I didn't. The only thing I had was a letter that said,

"Wait here, we'll come later."

What does that mean?
I don't see where this is going.

When Kami-sama was child, waited long time for parents.

My house was right there, in Yunzabit.

I believed that my parents would surely come back for me.

But no matter how long I waited, nobody ever came.

I wonder how long I must have waited.

30 years? Oh, no, perhaps 10.

I finally gave up, left my house behind, and departed Yunzabit.

I would go back once in a while to look in on it, but nothing ever changed.

So listen, what does any of that have to do with this?

You impatient. Now getting to point.

Though, you know, thinking back on it now, it was an odd house.

I didn't realize it until I learned more about the world, but that house was really unusual.

It was round, with four legs attached to it, almost like some sort of bug.

The door didn't have any knobs or locks, but would open when you spoke to it.

"Piccolo."

P--?

An entrance...

Get on top of here.

This is Kami-sama's house?

Say again, and it closes.

"Piccolo."

Look closely. This not house, but spaceship, yes?

That's right! Kami-sama is a Namekian!

That Kaio person did say that long ago, Planet Namek was nearly wiped out by abnormal climate, or whatnot.

Mister Popo also heard Kaio-sama speak.

Thought "what if," came here, and found this.

It's true, if this really is a spaceship, it would all make sense.

When Planet Namek had crisis, Kami-sama's parents put child Kami-sama aboard, and sent to Earth.

His parents planned to escape afterward, but there was some accident...

Yeah! I mean, any way you look at it, this doesn't seem like a house.

I-It must be... a spaceship!

But even if that's the case, can we use it?

The entrance worked, so it must have some power.

Is this the main switch? No. Let's see, this...

That's not right, either.

That's strange. I wonder if there's a code number or something.

It doesn't look like this operates using buttons.

I don't get it.

I wonder if this is some kind of sensor.

Voice?

Yeah! it uses words, like the entrance did!

What to say? "Piccolo"?

No. After all, that was the word for going in or out.

Move, you hear me? Fly! Let me see you fly!

That won't work. The language is different.

You have to speak Namekian.

I mean, back when Son-kun fought against Piccolo, I heard him speaking in some weird language.

That must be Namekian.

If that Namekian, Mister Popo knows it.

--Really?!
--Really.

Word "Piccolo" means "other world" in that language.

So, is word for entrance.

Why didn't you say so sooner?

So Piccolo Daimao is the "Demon King of Another World."

Here, try telling it to fly.

Fly to where?

Anywhere is fine.

I know, how about the Jupiter area?

Topul kuppa koloppungo.

I-Incredible! it's Jupiter!
This is an incredible spaceship!

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

Thank goodness.
Now Kami-sama sure to come back.

The spaceship is perfect!

That ship can get to Planet Namek in just one month!

I just have to convert the inside a little bit, and......hmm, yeah, it can launch in another five days.

To Planet Namek in Kami-sama's spaceship, huh?

That faint bit of light is about to come true.

With that being said, Popo-san, we're counting on you to go to Planet Namek.

Eh? Mister Popo cannot go.

Mister Popo cannot go.

Would be away from Kami-sama's palace for two months. Cannot do.

Come on! After all, you're the only one who can speak Namekian!

You seem pretty tough, too.

Popo-san, you're the only one we can ask to go.

No worry. Will teach you Namekian.

Then, Bulma-san, you'll have to go.

If anything were to happen, Bulma-san, you're the only one familiar with mechanical stuff.

Fine. it doesn't seem particularly dangerous.

But I'm not going there by myself, understand? Someone come with me.

I'm tellin' ya right now, no way in hell am I goin'.

--We wouldn't expect it of you.
--Son-kun is all laid up.

--What?!
--Kuririn, you'll come with me, right?

M-Me? I don't really mind.

Sounds nice. I wish I could go, too.

I want to see what kind of Shen Long would appear in Planet Namek.

Now, Goku, you take it easy, and come up with some countermeasure against the Saiyan.

Right. it's up to you two.

U-Um...

P-Please take me with you, too!

G-Gohan-chan, what sort of cockamamie jokes are you tellin'?

It isn't a joke! I-I really do want to go.

D-Don't be ridiculous. Another two months, on top of all this?

I'm sorry. I want to go, for all the world.

I want to bring Piccolo-san back to life with my own hands.

What kind of nonsense are you talkin' about?!

Sheesh, you haven't even healed all the way yet!

Physically, I'm all right.

W-What are you doin'?!

S-Stop that, Gohan-chan!

Please, take me with you.

I-I forbid anythin' of the kind!
I absolutely forbid it! Two months!

What about your cram school, and your lessons?!

Piccolo doesn't have anythin' to do with this!

You are a little boy! And boys should behave like boys!

Shut up!

G-Gohan-chan has turned into a d-delinquent...

M-Mother, right now...

Right now really isn't the time to talk about that.

We have to bring back to life the people who fought so desperately, and died while trying to defend the Earth, and fight back against the Saiyans once again.

I can... I can fight, too.

I have to... l have to do something.

Understand, Mother. I'm sorry.

He's got you beat, Chichi.

Let Gohan go off into space, with your blessin'.

Gohan, attaboy. You really have gotten stronger.

It'll be fine. No problem at all. Just leave it to us.

There won't be any danger this time around.

Can you learn Namekian in five days?

Let's see. I'll have to input it all into a translator, so I'll need ten days.

All right, see you in ten days, at the Kame House!

Right!

And so, in the blink of an eye, ten days pass, and the day of the launch arrives.

Whew, is this thing really going to get us to Planet Namek?

Quite a snappy little outfit there, Kuririn.

You're not, by any chance, making light of outer space, are you?

I even cut my hair, since it would be in the way inside my spacesuit!

Is that really you, Gohan?!
What happened to your hair?!

F-Father laughed at me, too.

Say what you will, this is the first time mankind is goin' out into space.

Can't have him bein' unmannerly.

We're counting on you. You be sure you find those Dragon Balls, now.

Right.

"Piccolo."

Grandpa, Mother, Mr. Turtle Hermit, and Mr. Turtle, we're off! Take care.

"Piccolo."

Be sure you eat regularly.

Send me a letter, every day.

Bye, now.

It's a little bit exciting, huh?

Say, Bulma-san, where should we put our bags?

Just put them any old place!
Hurry up and sit down!

She's in a bad mood about something.

Blast off in five seconds.
Destination, Planet Namek.

J-J-Just a minute!

5.. 4...

3... 2...

B-B-Bulma-san! W-W-We haven't f-f-fastened our belts y-y-yet!

That is incredible speed, to be sure.
They're out of sight already.

Gohan-chan! Don't forget to rinse!

Hmph, you're free to move around, now.

Now that we're out of the atmosphere, things will be calm.

Already?

Huh? What are you doing, Bulma-san?

What a pest! I'm going to change my clothes!

Change your clothes? You mean, into pajamas?

Uh-oh. Come to think of it, I forgot my pajamas.

--What about you, Gohan?
--I made sure to bring mine.

Not that it's any of my business,

but could you do something about that Shichigosan outfit?

This is just for the launch.

Actually, I made some clothes, and kept it a secret from Mother.

Well?

You really do respect Piccolo, don't you?

Yes, about the same as Father.

Those are unusual pajamas, huh?

They look uncomfortable to sleep in.

These aren't pajamas, you know. 
Looking at you two, I felt like a fool for being so fired up in getting ready for space.

H-Hey, have we done something wrong?

Beats me.


A Formidable New Enemy! Emperor of the Universe, Freeza"
  

Ugh, I am bored to death.

Good grief, this is only the seventh day.

There are still twenty-some more days to go.

I should have built a hibernation device or something.

Are you guys doing your image training again?

That's nice for you. You can pass the time.

Whew, not bad! You sure are strong.

After all, you've inherited Goku's blood, and had Piccolo train you.

Still, I'm surprised at how many techniques you have, Kuririn-san.

Say......it's up to you whether you train inside your heads, but the room is starting to get pretty messy, so would you mind tidying it up?

There is a lady present.

But Bulma-san, you're the one who made that mess.

We've cleaned up our own stuff.

I am busy. I have a lot of things I have to think about, too.

You guys are just riding along, so that's fine for you.

A moment ago, you said you were bored.

You hush. I wish you could be nicer to a delicate lady.

Ah, I'm so busy, I'm so busy...

if she's such a lady, I wish she wouldn't parade around in her underwear.

Say...

So anyway, I've been wondering about this for a while, but when that Saiyan Vegeta fled, where did he flee to?

Where, you ask?

I mean, the Saiyan's world has been gone for a long time, right?

Oh, yeah. In any event, he had taken some serious damage, so I'd think it would be somewhere with a civilization.

Do you suppose there's anyplace like that?

That brother of Son-kun's said something earlier, remember?

"We exterminate the people who live on planets that have good environments, and then sell them to aliens."

I wonder if Vegeta went to one of those alien folks, and is having them treat him.

If so, then whenever he comes to Earth again would depend on where that planet is.

If it's far away, that will buy us some time. 

I have to say,

Earth has attracted the attention of one heck of a bad guy.

T-To think that something like this would happen...

It has been days since Vegeta left Earth.

All right, here!

Something's coming!

Is it Freeza-sama?

It couldn't be. He just barely departed.

It's a round pod. That's a combatant.

The signal belongs to Vegeta-sama!

That's strange. We've received no word that he was returning.

Could something have happened?

Hey this is the flight control room!

Vegeta-sama is about to arrive!
Fall out to greet him at once!

He's here!

It's just one craft, all right! Where is Nappa-san?

I-Is something the matter? He's not coming out.

Hey, his life sign readings are awfully low.

What?

He's using his life support equipment!

This is bad! Hurry and carry him to the treatment room!

There.

You are healed. You may open your eyes.

Unfortunately, I was unable to regrow your tail.

No matter. it will grow back in due time.

Vegeta-sama, as mighty as you are, you were put to quite a bit of trouble, weren't you?

If this superstrong rubber protector was left in tatters, you were lucky to return to us in one piece.

It would take quite a bit for this to end up like this.

What in the world happened on this planet Earth?

Is Freeza-sama around?

N-No, he has departed.

He's already tired of this planet, is he?

U-Um, Kewie-sama said that......once your treatment was completed, he needed to speak to you, and to report to the Training Room.

Hmph, you tell him that I said, unfortunately, I don't have anything to talk to him about.

B-But...

Vegeta-sama, um, you forgot your Scouter.

I don't need it. You can have it.

I'll head for Earth first thing in the morning.

This time, I'll blow them to smithereens for sure.

No, before that, I'll go to Planet Namek...

Yo, Vegeta! Word is you got your butt kicked.

I hear Raditz and Nappa are dead, too.

Who was it that caused the supposedly invincible Saiyans such agony?

Get lost, Kewie. I don't have time to listen to your worthless drivel.

Now, just listen.

Freeza-sama is upset with you, going off by yourselves like that.

If he's not here, he can't gripe about it.

Now, remove that filthy hand of yours.

Still, Freeza-sama is a magnanimous person.

He seems willing to forgive you, since you discovered something quite sensational.

What?

He was thrilled that he might be able to gain eternal life and youth.

Say what?! Then, you mean Freeza-sama departed for...

Hmph, Planet Namek.

Damn! He was listening in to what we were saying on the Scouters?!

I have to beat him to it, or I'll be that bastard's puppet forever!

You apparently wanted to use the Dragon Balls to get eternal life, but you'll have to give up on that now.

Once Freeza-sama has his wish granted, he plans to exterminate the Namekians.

That bastard!

Hey, Vegeta!

V-Vegeta-sama!

Give me that!

I'm going to need it after all!

Vegeta!

I won't let you do it! They belong to me!

Not again.

Four more.

Geez, Son-san, you can't do this.

Miss Nurse, I'm all right now.

Goku, you see, is immortal.

Oh, did I just do something?

It must be my age. Lately, my mind has been slipping...

Oh, for the love of...

These sponge cakes are delicious.

Ahem!

Doctor!

How many times must I tell you?

If you keep this up, you'll never be discharged.

But as you can see, I'm...

I'm sure that hurts. You have been quite seriously injured, after all.

Now get back to bed.

S-Sorry.

Come on, Grandpa Glad-hands, help him up.

G-Grandpa Glad-hands?

Grandpa Glad-hands, am I?

My word...

"Grandpa Glad-hands."

Where is his wife, who was looking after him?

Oh, she must have gone up to the roof again, to look up into the sky.

I wonder if Gohan-chan is doin' okay.

And after all my insistin' that he send me a letter every day, I haven't gotten a single one.

Come back to me soon, safe and sound. 

30 days after leaving Earth, Bulma and the others at last reach their destination of Planet Namek.

We made it! There it is!

Wow! it sure is pretty!

That world is Planet Namek, huh?

No doubt about it!

The computer vouches that this is the bona fide Planet Namek!

We got here just about right on schedule, didn't we?

That's Kami-sama's spaceship for you!

That was smooth sailing, all right!

Sure was! Now, sit down and fasten your seatbelts so we can land.

There's going to be a pretty hard jolt.

Right!

Begin landing procedures for any suitable location.

We made it! We landed on Planet Namek!

We're here!

Hang on. I'm going to check the atmospheric components now.

I made sure to install some sensors. Aren't I prepared?

We'll be lucky if there's a certain amount of oxygen.

I did prepare some atmospheric masks, but our time would be limited, and I don't know how much help--

This is a lot like the place where Piccolo-san trained me.

Yeah, that place where we fought the Saiyans first, right?

I guess he'd instinctively feel more at ease in a place like his home.

Piccolo-san...

You guys don't have the least bit of common sense, do you?!

How can you just stroll on out here?!

You're as scary as ever...

For crying out loud. Well, as long as there are Dragon Balls here...

Please!

Look! I'm reading them!

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

K-Kuririn-san, I feel some strong Ki over there.

Ki?

You're right.

I'm feeling a lot of them.

Yeah. And what's more, they're all really powerful Ki.

W-What does that mean?

Oh, you guys. What are you talking about?

Those are Namekians.

As strong as Kami-sama and Piccolo were, it's not at all surprising that the Namekians at home would have powerful Ki, too.

--But...
--These Ki feel a little bit evil, don't they?

It's all right, I tell you.

Kaio-sama said that Namekians are peaceful by nature, didn't he?

Over in that direction, there are four Dragon Balls gathered together.

Now, let's go and meet the Namekians!

Yeah... You're right. They must be Namekians!

I feel silly for being scared.

Haven't we seen that before somewhere?

It's a Saiyan spaceship!

I knew it!

--It can't be!
--Oh, no, for real? Why?!

Gohan, mask your presence! We'll be detected!

R-Right!

I-It's Vegeta. it couldn't be anyone else.

D-Damn it!

He's already recovered from his injuries?

Come to think of it, he knows about the Dragon Balls, too.

W-What do we do? it's hopeless now!

All we can do is go back to Earth, right?
Am I right? Let's hurry back!

If that guy gets his hands on the Dragon Balls, it's all over.

Bulma-san, please contact Earth, tell them about this, and then return there by yourself.

Gohan and I will stay here, and try to collect the Dragon Balls.

But...

it's all right. We'll have the Dragon Radar.

--Right, Gohan?
--Right!

Okay.

Once I get back to Earth, I'll bring Son-kun aboard, and come right back.

The round trip will take a little over two months.

Sit tight, okay?

It'll be fine! Two months will go by like that!

It's just 30 days! That's only 7,200 hours, 426,000 minutes, or 52,260,000 seconds!

Right?

Right, a little over two months.

Freeza, you bastard.

You're trying to grab them away from me, but I won't let you.

I should be able to handle everyone besides Freeza, but I don't stand a chance fighting him head-on.

I have to steal the Dragon Balls and gain eternal life, no matter what.

Tch! To think that I would wind up using a Scouter again...

This way, huh?

He brought Zarbon and Dodoria with him.

W-What did you say?!

A-And then?

Yeah. So tell Son-kun and the others.

Do you hear me? Just don't tell Chichi-san. Got it?

Yeah... Yeah... Like I said...

No! it's not like that! Sheesh!

Right! You got it? I'm counting on you. Bye, now.

For Pete's sake...

What's the matter, you two?

Huh? What?

W-W-Why is that thing coming here again?!

T-That's what I'd like to know.

I found it, Freeza-sama.

Oh, good, good.

Now there are three of them left.


Rebellion Against Freeza! Vegeta, Burning with Ambition"

 
Now there are three of them left.

Hold on to those carefully, Dodoria-san.

It appears that Vegeta is after them, as well.

Freeza-sama, Kewie has just landed, in pursuit of Vegeta.

Also, the two large power readings that appeared shortly before Vegeta arrived suddenly disappeared, and remain so.

Our men are searching the area where the readings came from, so we should find out their source momentarily.

Well, the problem is how to deal with Vegeta, who has turned against me.

In that case, you need not worry.

Kewie is on his way to dispose of Vegeta.

The two of them have always hated each other, and their abilities are just about evenly matched.

Whatever happens, Vegeta will not come out unharmed.

Vegeta, you won't get away!

I found you, Vegeta. I have orders from Freeza-sama.

Do you read me, Vegeta? Now I can kill you, without any reservations!

Don't make me laugh, Kewie. 
Do you really think you can kill me?

Hurry up and get here. I'm waiting for you.

What are you, blind? Take a good look at your Scouter!

My battle power is clearly higher than yours!

In any event, we can't just stay here, huh?

I'll let you guys take care of getting the Dragon Balls.

Okay, I'm going back to Earth, so good luck.

Kuririn-san, someone is coming!

The readings vanished right around here.

Probably a Namekian.

Who is it?

It's probably a Namekian.

That's not a Namekian!

W-Who's that?

T-They're not Namekians. Who are they?

It doesn't really matter.

We've got orders to kill everyone on this planet.

Look at their outfits!

They're just like what the Saiyans were wearing.

But they aren't Saiyans!

I don't know what any of this means, but I've got a bad feeling.

Y-Yeah. Any way you look at it, those are not the sort of faces that say "let's be friends."

Gohan, build up your Ki, but keep your presence masked.

R-Right.

You see that? Their battle power is pretty much trash.

Are these guys just tourists?

We won't have any fun if they get away from us.

Take out their spaceship first.

All right.

Oh, no! The spaceship!

These guys are unlucky to have come here at a time like this.

Gohan, release your Ki. 
These guys aren't all that tough.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, did you hear that?

Not that tough? Does he mean us?

W-What's with these battle power ratings?!

--Let's get them!
--Right!

Hey, nice, nice!

That was not nice!

What do we do about that?

Is something the matter, Zarbon-san?

Yes, Freeza-sama. it concerns the scouts that were sent out earlier.

Apparently, these guys are not your average people.

For a moment, their battle powers rose, and then, after defeating our two scouts, their readings disappeared again.

Ho, that is unusual. it doesn't appear to be Vegeta, either.

No, Vegeta's reading is separate.

Both of these battle powers were around 1,500.

1,500, you say? Nothing would come of it if we left them alone, but their attitude seems poor.

The next time they appear, eliminate them.

It's hopeless! it's all over!
I'll never get back to Earth again!

Bulma-san, for now, let's get away from this place.

There could be trouble.
Someone stronger might be coming.

He's right. Those many Ki that we sensed are apparently not Namekians, but friends of Vegeta, so we have to find someplace to hide.

We'll manage something.

I'm sure the Namekians will fix the spaceship.

How nice that you're so optimistic.

Bulma-san...

Hmph, you're finally here......you moron.

The time is finally here, when we can settle the score, as rivals.

However, you've lost your touch.

With that battle power, you have no chance of beating me.

As rivals, you say?

Well, let me show you something.

When I was on Earth, I picked up something interesting from them.

What, how to run away quickly?

How to control my battle power.

How to control your battle power?

Take a good look at my battle power rating on your Scouter!

I-Impossible! Our battle powers have always been evenly matched!

You imbecile! I have been constantly engaged in actual combat!

The fight I had on Earth nearly killed me.

Did you think I would remain evenly matched with you, with you staying all curled up next to Freeza?!

17,000 ... 19,000 ... 21,000 ... 22,000 ...!

What happened, Zarbon?

I-I think it was a malfunction, but the Scouter I had set to Vegeta had a rating of around 22,000.

"22,000? That really must have been a malfunction."

Your Scouter is an older model, after all.

I'll get the correct reading with mine.

What's the rating?

T-That's impossible! Is my newer model malfunctioning, too?

It's risen to 24,000 !

24,000? Are you saying that his battle power is higher than ours?

I-It can't be. His battle power topped out at 18,000.

There is no reason to be surprised.

Vegeta has been fighting at the forefront, after all.

He must have come across some trick while he was on Earth.

But sir...

it is only 24,000. At that level, if you fight him together, it will be enough to beat him, will it not?

W-Wait, Vegeta! I just had an idea!
Let me team up with you!

I-I'll help you! I've never been fond of Freeza-sama-- I mean, Freeza!

N-Not a bad idea, right? W-With your battle power, if we teamed up,

I think we could handle Zarbon and Dodoria!

Just keep spouting your worthless lies!

You are one thoroughly sickening bastard!

Believe me, Vegeta!

Ah! Freeza-sama!

What?!

You fool!

I don't care how much your battle power has risen, if you took that unawares, you don't stand a chance!

You wish.

That was a perfectly pathetic strategy, coming from someone like you.

I'm stunned.

W-When did you...?

If my battle power has risen, it means my speed has risen, too!

Which means, you've completely enraged me with that move!

Die!

What a messy firework.

V-Vegeta's rating of 24,000 was genuine after all.

He defeated Kewie like it was nothing.

It is no great concern.

Now, to look for the fifth Dragon Ball.

Thanks to their Scouters, they'll know what action I've taken.

Even if I'm careless enough to get close to them, though I may be able to take Zarbon or Dodoria, not even I could beat Freeza.

Judging by the transmissions from Freeza's men that I heard on my Scouter, the Dragon Balls don't have any effect unless you have all seven of them together. All right.

I'll find just one of them.
Once they've gathered the other six, I'll find an opening to steal them.

If it goes right, I'll have them all, and gain eternal life.

Then defeating Freeza will be more than just a dream.

I am reading ten or so Namekians in that direction.

Very well. it sure would be nice if they have the fifth Dragon Ball.

Please be sure not to let your guard down.

After all, it appears that there are some other curious fellows out there beside Vegeta.

--Yes, sir.
--Now, let us be going.

Once he's out of the way, I'll be Number One.

I, the Saiyan, Vegeta, will rule the entire universe!

Bulma-san, we have to hurry it up a little more.

We'll be spotted out here.

You guys can fly, right? Then take me and fly.

We'd like to do so, but we have to walk to mask our presence.

Bulma-san, up there is a good place.

It will be hard to spot us inside that cave.

How long am I going to have to live in a place like that?

Kuririn-san...

Do you sense any Ki over there?

You're right. These Ki feel different from those others earlier.

They could really be Namekians this time.

Hide! There are some other Ki coming this way from over there!

--What, now?
--Come on, hurry!

What in the world is going on?!

They're coming this way.

Do you think they know about us?

I don't know.

They're here!

T-They're gone. Thank goodness.

Apparently, we weren't what they were after. But then, what exactly was that just now?

What's the matter, you two?

B-Bulma-san, would you confirm something with the Dragon Radar?

W-What?

When you checked earlier, there were four Dragon Balls gathered together, right?

Would you see where they are now?

All right, I'll look.

All four of them are moving! Which means...

Yeah, no doubt about it!

Those guys just now were carrying the four Dragon Balls!

T-They were?

I knew it.

Gohan...

Gohan!

--Yes?
--Gohan, did you see him?

The strange one who was flying second from the front?

Yes.

I sensed a tremendous power from him.

T-The moment I saw him, I was petrified.

H-He could be much, much worse than even Vegeta.

I-It looked like there were some other heavy hitters there, but he, for one, is in a league of his own.

Worse than Vegeta? Oh, no. Who was he?

I-I don't know, but I think they were Vegeta's friends.

They all had on the same sort of clothing.

Damn it, how are we supposed to get the Dragon Balls away from those guys?!

Say, look here.

That group is headed toward another Dragon Ball.

What's going on? Do they have a Radar, too?

What location is it?

About 50 kilometers in this direction.

Kuririn-san, that's the place where we sensed Ki that you said could be Namekians.

I'm going to go there and see what's happening.

I'm going, too!

J-Just a minute!

Are you going to leave me here, all by myself?

It's far safer for you to stay here than it is to fumble your way around.

When you put it that way, you're right.

Okay, we're off.

Hurry back, okay?

Remember, Gohan, hurry, but suppress your Ki as much as you can.

--Can you do that?
--Yes!

All right!

There they go. I wonder if they're really all right.

Oh yeah, I have to contact Earth.

Really?

So then, are Gohan and the others okay?

Yeah. They did in fact arrive safely on Planet Namek.

But Gohan and the others aren't the only ones who went to Namek.

That Saiyan named Vegeta is also there.

Vegeta?! He's there?!

And that's not all. In addition to Vegeta, there are a over a dozen of his friends on Planet Namek.

The spaceship they rode there in was blasted by them, and they can't get back to Earth now.

W-What?!

What's more, they said that at least one of them had a Ki that was greater than Vegeta's.

It can't be! A Ki greater than Vegeta's?
There's a guy like that?

Yo, you still alive?

What?! Here I come all this way to see ya, why the long face?

The senzu beans're finally ready. 
Just a few of 'em, though.

Karin-sama said to take all seven of the senzu beans that're ready.

Wow, all right! That's what I call good timing!

Hurry up and give me one!

S-See here! You mustn't give strange foods to patients!

Here ya go.

I've been waiting for this moment!

Here it is! Kaio-sama sent this new gi to me, just for this day!

All right, I'm off to Planet Namek now!

Oh, thanks, I'll take the remaining senzu beans with me.

Planet Namek? How are you planning to get there?

When Bulma's daddy came to visit me, I made sure to ask him to build me a spaceship, just in case.

A spaceship? You mean like Kami-sama's?

That was made from stuff that ain't from Earth, so not even Bulma's daddy could pull that off.

S-So then...?

I thought about it hard, and realized that there are two other Saiyan spaceships on Earth.

The spaceship my brother came here in, and the spaceship that I came to Earth in when I was a kid.

O-Oh, right!

I had Bulma's daddy go look for it.

My brother's blew up with that other one, but mine was from way back, so it ended up unharmed.

I'm having him repair and reconstruct it.

Kinto Un!

Okay, I'm gonna go save them.

Mm-hmm.

Take me to Bulma's house!

He's going to save them? From what?

As it turns out...if things're as hairy as all that, why'd that bastard look so happy?

It must be his Saiyan blood, I'd say.

It goes without saying that he wants to save everyone, but more than anything, he seems to get a huge thrill from fighting someone strong.

That guy ain't normal, all right.
I can't keep up with him.

Unbelievable. To think that there's someone out there even stronger than Vegeta!


Protect the Dragon Balls! The Namekian Offensive" 
  

Ah, Goku-chan!

Bulma's mommy.

My, my, are you all better already?

Just like you see.

By the way, is the refit on the spaceship I ordered done yet?

Well, I'm not sure. it looked like he was still working on something.

Eep! Still?! Geez, what to do?

He's in the inner yard. Come along.

I have to say, who would have thought that little Goku-chan would grow up to be so handsome?

Say, let's have a date sometime, okay? Okay?

I-I have to defeat the Saiyan, first.

Aren't you the busy one?

Oh, right, I found the most delicious cake shop a little while ago.

All thanks to you, Goku-chan.

If the Earth had been gone, I wouldn't have been able to have any.

I guess not.

Dear! Goku-chan is here!

I-Is that......my spaceship?

It's huge!

Hey there, Goku. Better already?

Mm-hmm, thanks to a senzu bean.

This is mine, right? Is it true you ain't finished with it yet?

Mm-hmm, it's almost ready. 
Come on inside and have a look.

Well, I'll bring you something to drink, okay?

Thanks.

Awesome! I'm surprised that tiny spaceship became all this!

What can I say?
Everything is made to your order.

I'll be able to do some decent training like this.

I worked hard on this. Finding the spaceship was hard enough, but it was all broken up in pieces.

Luckily, all the important parts remained, but I had to rebuild almost all of it.

My spaceship was in pieces?

That's strange. I wonder if I busted it when I was a kid.

Well, I have to admit, Saiyan science is absolutely fantastic.

Huh? Um, where's the artificial gravity device?

This is it over here.

Oh, yeah? This thing?

Let's see, this here is the switch.

This here is the controller.

It can put out a maximum of 100 Gs, just like you ordered, but that would be crazy, even for you, wouldn't it?

At 100 Gs, if you weigh 30 kg, that would make you 6,000 kg!

That's six tons. Ordinarily, that would kill you.

That's okay. Unless I train someplace like that, I ain't gonna beat the Saiyan.

So, can't this thing fly yet?

Oh, it will fly. To the ends of the universe.

Huh? Then...

The bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom are down that ladder.

So then, what part of it ain't done yet?

I can't quite settle on the location for the stereo speakers.

As long as you're listening, you'll want it to sound good, right?

T-That's all?!

When you say it ain't done yet, that's all that's left?!

That's all? In order to hear top sound, you have to think about reverberation and such. it's quite tricky.

Never mind about where to put the stereo!

I'm in a hurry, so I need to take off right now!

What are you in such a rush for?

I got a message from Bulma!
In any event, I have to hurry!

Hurry up and show me how to fly this thing!

All right. So, you're sure about the stereo placement, then?

All the data has been inputted already.

All you have to do is give the button a little bop-bop, and you'll arrive at Planet Namek in six days.

Six days? I can get there in just six days? That's awesome!

Is it true? Goku is here?

Yes. He's looking at the spaceship in the inner yard now.

Oh, my!

Oh, my goodness!

Let's see, it's this button next, right?

Considering how hastily I put that together, it really did fly.

Huh? Where's Goku?

He left in a big hurry.

I hope he's sure about the stereo.

Wow, this thing sure is fast, all right.

I have to start training, right away.

I'm glad I'll get there in six days, but I've gotta surpass that Vegeta guy before then.

Let's see, if I remember right, Kaio-sama said his planet was 10-times gravity.

Maybe I should get accustomed to 20-times, to start out with.

That's kicking in, all right.

We're close. We are close.
Surpress your Ki completely now.

We'll walk up and approach from here.

Right.

They're on the other side of that cliff.

That Ki is incredible!

Those houses are just like the spaceship we came here in.

What are they up to?

The other guys are one thing, but those three--especially the one in the middle, inside that round vehicle--have a frighteningly strong Ki.

I-I can tell.

Look at what the two guys on his side are holding in their hands!

Those are Dragon Balls!

Gigantic Dragon Balls!

Is something the matter, Dodoria-san?

No, there was just a small power reading up on that cliff.

It is gone now. it must have been a small animal, or an insect.

Holy crap! We were this close to being spotted!

Freeza-sama, we have only found five of them.

The others appear to be out at the moment.

Come on out of there, unless you'd rather die.

That looks just like Piccolo-san!

I-It's a Namekian!

What are they planning to do with the Namekian?

Kuririn-san, are they all Saiyans?

No, they aren't. They all have the same battlewear on, but they aren't Saiyans. For one thing,

Vegeta is supposed to be the only Saiyan remaining.

Not counting Goku or yourself.

T-Then...

Come to think of it, Goku's older brother mentioned something.

Our job is to travel around the universe, looking for planets that have good environments, exterminating the people already living on them, and then selling them to aliens seeking a suitable planet for a high price.

It could be that he was pals with these guys.

I have to admit, though, I don't see Vegeta around anywhere.

Is he off looking for Dragon Balls someplace else?

As you can see, I am collecting your Dragon Balls. My name is Freeza.

Now then, where are the others who were here?

According to our search, there are supposed to be ten of you.

Do you intend not to say anything?

I will kill you.

Now, let me have your answer.

Nuwainita hanitaemao moteleki koeto...

Speak in language that we can understand, as well, not in Namekian.

I know that you can speak it.

The others have left to work the farms.

All that are left are us older ones and the children.

Yes, if I can have you answer me straightforwardly like that, I will not do anything to you.

Now then, let me have you continue to answer my questions.

Where is your Dragon Ball?

I believe there is one here, as well.

I-I don't know! We don't have anything like that!

Dodoria-san...

Yes, sir?

The second Namekian we killed, as I recall, said something quite interesting, did he not?

Yes, something about him not being able to hand over his Dragon Ball, except to one judged to be a man of valor.

Yes, yes. That man proved to be quite stubborn.

We simply could not get him to cooperate with us, until we killed one of them, to serve as an example.

Once we did, he told us all sorts of things.

That the Grand Elder of this world created the seven Dragon Balls;

That the seven elders each held one of them with great care; And that each of them would ask to
match wits, extend tests of strength, and discuss the reasons for one's wish.

Then, once one is judged to be a man of valor by each elder, one would finally be able to obtain them.

However, even though I tried to do as was asked of me, I was told that he would never hand it over to me, you see?

So I could not help myself but to kill him.

As such, it took a great deal of effort to locate the first one.

The next three were quite easy.
Everyone was quite accommodating.

Hmph, I see.

So that's the deal.

A-Accommodating, you say?!

You are lying!

Yeah! There's no way the other elders handed them over to you without any protest!

I beg to differ. Once we did this, they quickly became amenable.

Zarbon-san, if you would show them.

Yes, sir.

Why, you...!

Stop!

W-What fiends!

H-How awful!

Gohan, control your Ki! They'll know we're here!

But if we don't do something...

I mean, you want to bring Piccolo and everyone else back to life, right?

There's no way we can take on someone like that.

If we show ourselves now, we'd only die in vain.

What do you say? Are you feeling a little more compliant now? Hmm?

What is your purpose in collecting the Dragon Balls?

Oh, it is quite a frivolous little wish.

I was thinking of gaining eternal life.

He's what?! Then, what about Vegeta?

H-He's out for eternal life, too.

Do you suppose they aren't friends with Vegeta?

I don't know.

The likes of you will get the Dragon Ball over my dead body!

So you are saying you would rather choose death

than give your Dragon Ball to me? I see.

The people of this planet seem to be very stubborn, indeed.

But then......can you still remain stubborn after the death of those children?

W-What?!

You'd even go after children?!

There's a strong battle power.

Freeza-sama, over there!

Oh, you've come, have you?

The Namekians!

They're coming to help!

Damn, that ill foreboding I felt proved true!

We cannot have this, can we?

I was finally about to have the Dragon Ball brought out, too.

Imagine, you interrupting your work, so that you could come here and be killed.

I see now. The rumors of people attacking the villages and stealing the Dragon Balls are true, are they?

You'll pay for this!

How dare you trample the peace of Planet Namek?!

Ho, you intend to fight us?
How great is your battle power?

Dodoria-san?

Yes, sir, I will check.

Please do not be disappointed.
All three are in the vicinity of 1,000.

There is no need for us to even fight them.

So that's it. I now understand how they are able to so precisely locate our few villages, which dot the land across the vastness of Planet Namek.

They are able to search, using those devices!

How laughable!

You want to tangle with us, with a battle power of 1,000 ?! Eh?!

He's wrong. Those three are just suppressing their Ki.

Don't these guys even know that much?

The Saiyans were surprised by that, as well, huh?

Let 'em have it!

What is this? That's what you call a battle power of 1,000?

What's going on here?
All three have increased to 3,000!

Well, well, they are pretty good, are they not?

I get it. The Namekians are a race that are able to control their battle power.

Such is a very rare type.

All right. Including his, there are only three of those devices that remain unbroken.

Children, stand away from me.

Quickly!

Dodoria-san...

Yes, sir.

You guys are pathetic.

You're going to trouble me with this, are you?

May I take care of all three of them?

Feel free.

Y-You bastard! Did you really think you could defeat me with such a petty technique?

Oh, no! He was going after the Scouters!

Scouters?

T-Those devices that can tell an opponent's strength and location!

So that's it! Then they can't determine the precise location of the Dragon Balls after all!

They use those Scouter things to look for the Namekians, and then strong-arm them!

Which is why, when the old-timer there figured it out, he destroyed all of their Scouters!

Why, you...!

I-I'll kill them all!

I'll kill them all!!

I'll kill every last one of them!

Elder! Look out!


Dodoria in Terrifying Hot Pursuit! Vegeta Learns the Truth" 
  


--Elder!
--Dodoria-san! Just a moment!

Begin by first killing the three younger ones!

Damn it!

I'll put all three of you away in ten seconds!

Ridiculous! Do you think you're a match for all three of us?!

Am I a match for all three of you, you ask?

Such an amusing joke.

What?!

--What?!
--It's no use!

It will take more than that attack to defeat him!

You must now realize that defying me or trying to run away will do you no good.

But, in any event, come on down here.

You have finally become compliant. That will do.

You destroyed our precious Scouters.

What do you say you produce your Dragon Ball for me, to apologize?

I've got no other choice.
But promise me one thing: That you will not harm the children, no matter what!

It could have been this way from the beginning.

Why, those lousy...!

H-Hey, Gohan, don't go getting any funny ideas.

We are just no match for those guys.

Now, take this, and leave here at once!

Good work.

While we are at it, how about you tell me where the other two Dragon Balls are?

Don't be absurd! We Namekians would die before doing anything like selling each other out!

Now, hurry up and get out of here, like you promised.

My, my, not you, too?

No one on this planet ever says anything about their companions.

Sure enough, I must have you die, along with the children.

What did you say?!

That wasn't our agreement!

You said if I gave you the Dragon Ball, you wouldn't do anything to us!

But unless you have all seven Dragon Balls together, there is no meaning, is there?

You have destroyed our Scouters, so I must ask you to tell us where the remaining two balls are.

I told you, I'll die before telling you where my people are!

Is that how badly you wish to die?

In that case, I will do as you ask.

What?!

kill all three of them.

--Yes, sir.
--T-That was dirty!

You two run away! Run away from here!

R-Right!

Let me show you some Namekian pride!

Cargot!

Control yourself, Gohan!

Control yourself! There's nothing we can do!

Cargot... Cargot! Cargot!

You never had time to show us your so-called "pride"!

It's a trivial matter to crush a kid like this.

Well, be that as it may, die!

Stop!!

What?! A buddy of yours?! Where?!

That'll show you!

W-Who are you?!

That idiot!

I am going to belt you!

You're gonna what?

Kuririn-san?

Y-You dumb-ass! G-Get out of here, quick!

Quick!

Right!

D-Damn it...

Go after them! Dodoria-san, catch them!
Gohan! Fly as fast as you can!
If they catch us, it's all over!

Right!

You fools! Do you think you can get away?!

It's no use! He's faster than us!

He's catching up!

Gohan!

Oh, no!

Damn it!

I won't make it in time!

Gohan, run! Hurry! He's coming!

Damn, these guys sure are slippery!

Kuririn-san, let's descend and fight him!

We can't! He's not an opponent we can get anywhere with by fighting!

Just keep flying as fast as you can!

Ah, I know!

Gohan, from here on, don't look in my direction! Close your eyes!

I have an idea. Got it?!

Yes!

Take this!

Taiyo-ken!!

My eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

I did it! I-it worked!

Gohan, hide now, while we can!

Right!

Damn it, where did you go?!

Damn it all!

It's all right. He'll never find us.

The old man destroying those Scouter things really saved our butts!

If he had one of them, he could even detect the Ki coming from that little kid, after all.

Damn, how am I supposed to find those puny guys?

This is driving me crazy!

Thank goodness. He's giving up, and leaving.

I'll just blow them away.

See you in hell!

Take that. That's what you get for sneaking around.

Freeza-sama told me to bring them back, but this is better than letting them get away.

But then, I never did find out who those punks really were.

They weren't your run-of-the-mill kids.

But it doesn't matter either way, now.

We're saved!

For now, let's head back to where Bulma-san is, okay?

Are you able to fly?

Y-Yes.

T-Thank you so much for saving me.

If you want to thank someone, thank Gohan, here.

I was so scared, I didn't want to help.

But Kuririn-san, if you hadn't saved us, we'd both be dead.

Well, in any case, come with us.

We're not exactly the bad guys here, after all.

Okay.

There are, in fact, Dragon Balls here, but these weirdoes keep ganging together, And if they all get taken away like this, there's no reason why a fragile lady like me should have to risk all the danger to come to this planet, is there?

Am I right?

Hey, Dad, are you listening?!

Oh, yes, I'm listening to every word.
So, what's the matter?

Anyhow, everything is as bad as it can be.

The spaceship is all busted up, and we can't come home.

Come home?

That's not a good idea, is it?

Goku just barely took off for there.

Huh? Son-kun? Son-kun is coming here to Planet Namek?

Really? He really, really is?

Yeah, that's right. He's scheduled to arrive in about six days.

Hooray!

Hey, Bulma!

You know, without Scouters, it's gonna be a big pain finding those last two Dragon Balls.

Sure, it's not that big a planet, but still...

V-Vegeta! Why, you...!

Yo! it's been quite a long while, hasn't it, Dodoria-san?

A-Are you the one that blindsided me, Vegeta?

You and Zarbon are always hanging around with Freeza, after all.

I was waiting for you to go out on your own.

After all, as long as Freeza isn't around, I'll bet I can handle you.

What?! A Saiyan like you?! You've got quite a smart mouth, don't you?!

Vegeta, you hand over that Scouter, nice and easy, and then beat it.

Do that, and I'll let you go this one time.

So that's it. The sound cut out all of a sudden, so I thought something must have happened, and sure enough, it sounds like you've lost your Scouters.

This is great. Now, if I approach, you won't know it.

What did you say?!

It will take several days for you to go back to Planet Freeza to fetch some more Scouters.

I'll bet you want this.

You've decided to hand it over, huh?

It's about time you felt intimidated.

Now, if you're lucky, I might just spare your life.

H-How could you do that, Vegeta?!

W-Why did you destroy it?

Because I don't need it anymore.

W-What? Without that thing, you don't know where Freeza-sama or the Namekians are, either.

Unfortunately for you... while fighting the earthlings, I learned that they could tell an opponent's strength and location without having to use a Scouter.

And there was another Saiyan there who possessed the technique.

In which case, I should be able to do it, too, right?

It's easy, once you learn how to do it.

Although, it would be too much for you or Freeza to handle, since you only have your eyes set on power.

But then, I was like that, too, up to now.

I get it! Those runts I was chasing were earthlings, weren't they?

Earthlings?!

You've joined up with the earthlings, haven't you?!

Dream on! There's no way the earthlings could have come here.

If they were here, I'd take care of them first thing!

None of that matters! Just get out of here!

Unless you'd rather I kill you!

L-I'm offering to let you go!
You should be grateful!

What are you so scared of?
Why don't you come at me, already?

I know why.

You learned from my fight with Kewie that my strength is much greater than it was before, and now you're afraid!

You saw it on your Scouter, right?

My battle power?

T-That rating was wrong!
It was a Scouter malfunction!

Don't you shrug me off!

You're the one who's shrugged me off!

There's no way that move was going to work on me!

We Saiyans grow stronger with every fight.

The stronger our opponents are, the more our strength increases.

That's why, after nearly getting killed in battle on Earth, I've powered way up!

That's what the warrior Saiyan race does!

Is this what's become of your vaunted power with you slacking off? Eh?

W-Wait, Vegeta! if you'll let me go,

I'll let you in on a little secret!

It's about your homeworld, Planet Vegeta!

What?

Did you say Planet Vegeta?

What secret about Planet Vegeta?!

Let me go! Let me go, and I'll tell you!

Y-You're not gonna kill me as soon as I've told you, are you?

I'll kill you right now unless you tell me! Start talking!

Your homeworld of Planet Vegeta wasn't lost in a collision with a giant meteor, like Freeza-sama told you.

What did you say?

Individually, a Saiyan's strength is nowhere near Freeza-sama's...

But if a bunch of Saiyans united together, it would prove to be quite a problem.

What's more, there were a small number of Saiyans being born who, like you, were becoming extraordinary warriors, and the number was starting to grow.

Once you started inexplicably possessing such power, you wouldn't remain an obedient, order-following race forever, so at that point, Freeza-sama decided that he needed to take measures.

And so, Freeza-sama destroyed Planet Vegeta, and all of the Saiyans on it, himself!

But Vegeta, you should be grateful to Freeza-sama.

It appeared that he could make use the prodigious skills of you, the prince of Planet Vegeta, and so Freeza-sama intentionally waited until you were no longer on the planet.

Looks like your shock is as great as you'd expect.

I'll just use this opportunity to return to Freeza-sama.

Don't misunderstand, Dodoria.

I don't give a damn about the planet, my friends, or my parents.

I'm just disgusted at myself for not knowing this, and letting myself be used as your doormat ever since I was a kid!

Freeza-sama!

Freeza is afraid of the fathomless potential of the Saiyans.

I have to hurry up and conquer this 50-times gravity.

Now, to get started!


Vegeta's Secret Plan! Tragic Attack Upon the Namekians" 
  

I've killed Dodoria.

For all the power that Dodoria prided himself on, it was easy.

I've improved so much, even I am surprised.

That battle on Earth was indeed good for something.

Although I have to admit, Dodoria did say something unusual.

I get it! Those runts I was chasing were earthlings, weren't they?

True, I do sense two large powers getting farther away from me.

They couldn't possibly be earthlings, but it does bother me.

Maybe I should go check them out.

Whoever they are, I have to eliminate anyone who might get in my way, even the small fry.

The cave where Bulma-san is hiding is just a little farther that way.

This is your first time on this planet.
I'm surprised you know it so well.

What's that?! Something's coming at incredible speed!

Hide! Hurry!

R-Right!

They're going to find us, out here in a place like this, aren't they?

Never mind, just suppress your Ki, right now!

We'll have to leave the rest up to fate.

Is it that monstrous-looking bastard again?

Damn it, how did he figure out where we are?

Both of those powers have disappeared.

What's going on?

It happened right around there, abruptly.

Kuririn-san! Up there!

V-Vegeta! So he really is here on this planet.

How can it be that he's here?
This is a complete disaster!

He's still looking around.

He wasn't wearing one of those Scouter devices.

So how can he tell where we are?

Y-You don't think he's gained the ability to sense Ki, do you?

If so, this is bad. Even with us suppressing our Ki, this kid still has his slight Ki...

Damn, have I misread things?

It might be because I'm not used to this power-sensing technique yet.

Maybe I shouldn't have destroyed that Scouter.

Hmm? I sense a small power.

This time, I'm not misreading it. Now to find it...

He's coming this way!

I-It's hopeless! He's gonna find us!

Around that rock there.

At this point, we have no choice but to fight.

Even though we know we'll get killed.

--Let's go!
--Right!

Now!

A fish, huh?

Oh, well.

Right now, getting my hands on the two remaining Dragon Balls-- no, even just one of them, comes first.

If I can just hide one of them, Freeza will be unable to get all seven of them together.

Then I'll wait for Freeza and the others to leave themselves open, and take their five from them.

Having them lose their Scouters means that luck is on my side!

We're saved!

I thought we'd had it for sure, there.

We sure got lucky. I've gotta hand it to that thing in the water.

Anyhow, let's head back to where Bulma-san is, while keeping our presence as masked as we can.

--It's right nearby, isn't it?
--Yes.

We didn't even fight, and I already feel exhausted.

I want to get some rest.

I'm, uh...

I'm honestly beginning to wish we hadn't come to this planet.

I know that's not fair to the late Yamucha-san and the others.

But far from bringing everyone back to life, it looks like there are going to be even more deaths.

Do you mean us?

Mm-hmm.

Look, Kuririn-san! Over there!

Oh, right, right.

Bulma-san!

Huh? She's not here.

She must be hiding further inside the cave.

Bulma-san!

It's us! Where are you?! Bulma-san!

A Capsule House!

What have you been off gallivanting around for?!

Leaving a young lady here, all by herself!

Gallivanting, she says.

Who's the small-sized Piccolo-looking fellow there?

By any chance, is that a Namekian?

It's all right.

Eh? Did something happen?

Please, just let us come inside right now.

We'll tell you everything that happened.

Oh, right!

I just got some welcome news from my dad!

Son-kun has taken off, and is headed here to Planet Namek!

And get this, he'll arrive in just six days!

You see, my dad took the spaceship that Son-kun rode in on when he was a baby and completely rebuilt it!

What's more, Son-kun is going to undergo incredible training inside!

F-Father is coming?

--Hooray!
--Yahoo!

Undergoing incredible training, you say?

Great! Great! Now we have some hope!

Next up, this, for 30 minutes!

I'm sensing them! Large powers!
There are at least 20 of them!

No doubt about it, there's a
Namekian village out there!

And they probably have a Dragon Ball.

Freeza and the others don't have Scouters.

No matter what action I take now, they won't know about it!

I knew it. The folks in this village are still alive, which proves that Freeza and the others haven't been here yet.

--What's this?
--An alien.

Is your elder here?

I have come to get your Dragon Ball.

W-What?!

I am the elder.

Would you mind telling me why you want the Dragon Ball?

Never mind, just hand it over, right now! You do have it, right?

Leave us. I cannot give it to you.

I can sense evil coming from you.

Then die.

Bang!

Elder!

Eat up. Don't be so reserved.
It's not all that great, though.

You can't blame him. Most of his village just got killed, right?

Oh, right. This isn't really the time to eat, huh?

We don't eat this sort of thing.
We get by just drinking water.

Get out of here! There were fields around your village, and you were growing vegetables, or something, weren't you?

Those were Ajissa saplings.

Ajissa saplings?

Yes. Long ago, before the climatic anomaly, Namek was supposedly a pretty world, dense with Ajissa trees.

But then......the Ajissa forests, along with us Namekians, almost completely died out.

So now, we're increasing the number of Ajissa trees there are, in an attempt to make Namek beautiful again.

Say, what's your name?

Dende. Um, who are you people, exactly?

K-Kuririn-san, is that...?

What's going on, all of a sudden?
Is someone coming again?

N-No, it's not that.

There are Ki out there, diminishing, one after another.

T-The Namekians are being killed once again.

T-The one doing the killing is someone we know quite well.

Vegeta! He's attacking a different village now!

W-What an awful bunch those guys are!

S-Sure enough, Vegeta has learned a technique to sense Ki.

This is a problem!

We'll have to watch how we move around until Goku shows up.

I'm not sure if Vegeta and that Freeza fiend are working together, but if either one of them use the Dragon Balls to gain eternal life, it would be the end of the world!

If we were to find just one of the Dragon Balls, and hide it, they won't be able to get all seven of them together.

We can't! if we did that, they would keep looking, until they had killed all of the Namekians!

O-Oh, no!

This sucks, no matter what happens.

E-Even once Goku gets here, there's no guarantee that he can beat them.

Damn!

If only I'd finished off Vegeta when I could...

P-Please tell me more about yourselves.

Where did you come from? How do you know about the Dragon Balls?

P-Please save the people of my world!

Why, you...! How could you do this?!

You aren't going to hand over the Dragon Ball, no matter what, huh?

I'll be damned if I give it to you!

You are one utterly stubborn old man.

Okay, then, suit yourself. I'll find it on my own.

Wait!

Grate on me, will you?!

Here I thought it would be hidden, but there it is, on grand display.

This Kami-sama guy was a Namekian who had fled to Earth.

We want to use the Dragon Balls here to bring our fallen friends back to life.

If our wish is granted right, the Dragon Balls on Earth will return, as well.

S-So that's what's going on, is it?

I've finally unraveled the mystery of who you are.

Please, come with me!
I will show you to the Grand Elder!

Grand Elder?

Who's the Grand Elder?

T-The one who gave birth to all of us here on Namek.

The sole survivor of the climatic anomaly long ago, who has once again given vitality to Namek.

I am the Grand Elder's th child.

The sole survivor? How is it that you folks have children?

How? We lay eggs out of our mouths.

Oh, is that right? That's unusual, huh?

S-So then, the Grand Elder is a female, right?

Female? What's a female?

W-What is it? There are two kinds of Namekians, right? Male and female.

Let's see, for example... you have your father, and then your mother.

Two kinds? N-No...

Did you hear that? They don't have males and females.

What a dull planet. I'm glad I'm not Namekian.

Er, never mind that, tell us, why are we going to the Grand Elder's place?

The people who attacked our village already had four Dragon Balls.

A-And you said a lot of people were just killed over in that direction, right?

Y-Yeah, probably by a guy named Vegeta.

There isn't a single Ki remaining there.

They were probably completely wiped out.

In that case, there aren't very many Namekians left on this world.

R-Right. if Vegeta found the Dragon Ball in the village he attacked, that means there's only one left.

By any chance, does the Grand Elder have the last one?

Y-Yes.

Oh, no!

Freeza may have lost his Scouters, but Vegeta has gained the ability to search for Ki!

If he searches for his Ki, he'll arrive at the Grand Elder's place before long, and steal the seventh Dragon Ball from him!

T-Then we have to let the Grand Elder know at once!

I beg you! I beg you!

If either Freeza or Vegeta are granted eternal life, it would be awful!

All right. Let's hurry. Show me the way.

Right!

I'll go see the Grand Elder with Dende.

Gohan, you and Bulma-san wait here for me.

There's no point in all of us going, is there?!

All right. Be careful.

Remember, Gohan, you guys be careful, too!

Right!

Now then...if I submerge this Dragon Ball here, no one will be able to find it. 
I'm the only one who knows it's here.

Freeza and the others have five Dragon Balls.

I guess I'll go look for the last one.

Dodoria is far too late in returning.

Could he still be pursuing those unusual runts?

Never mind.

If the fool cannot catch those two kids, then leave him be.

Never mind him, go and find the last two Dragon Balls.

Yes, sir, as you wish. if we search the remaining villages, the Dragon Balls are sure to be there.

With the two of us searching, we should at least be able to find their villages.

Then, I shall take these five Dragon Balls, and wait for you back at the spaceship.

I am counting on you.

Once we have just two more of them, I can have my wish granted.

Yes, sir.

You look over in that direction.

If you find a village, do nothing, and come let me know.

If there are any strong Namekians, you won't be able to handle them.

We'll meet up again in three hours, back at the spaceship.

Yes, sir.

It could be that Vegeta has already located the two that remain.

Even so, he will likely be coming after our Dragon Balls.

That could be good, and save us the bother of having to find him.

Once Vegeta comes after them, we will turn the tables, and take his two from him.

By doing so, we shall have all seven of them together.

And then I shall be given eternal life.

Now then, to wait at my leisure in the spaceship.

Vegeta seems to have grown even stronger than before.

And I sensed an even stronger Ki from that Freeza guy.

I don't know what kind of training Goku is going through, but this time, even he might not be able to handle them.

In any case, let's get the Dragon Ball that the Grand Elder has, and hide for the five and a half days it will take for Goku to arrive.

After that, all we can do is wait for Goku to work a miracle.

If I'm getting so I'm expecting miracles, it's all over, huh?

Tch, I didn't have any female presence in my life at all.



Resurrected Companions! The Beauty Soldier Zarbon's Demon Transformation"
  


All right... good...

I've gotten pretty accustomed to 20-times gravity.

Now, how about I try 30-times?

Goku! Do you hear me? Goku! Huh?

Hmm? Ah, that voice! Is that you, Kaio-sama?

Yeah, it's Kaio, all right.

You're not, by any chance, in space, are you?

What are you doing in space?

Oh, I see. Planet Namek, right?

I hope you do find Dragon Balls there.

What, you didn't know, Kaio-sama?

There's something terrible happening on Planet Namek.

Something terrible? Well, you can tell me about it later.

As it turns out, I've had some visitors come by.

Visitors? What about them?

It's incredible! These visitors traveled the Serpentine Road and arrived here in far less time than you did.

What's more, there are four of them.

--Four of them?
--That's right.

And I'm sure you know these four quite well.

I-It couldn't be!

They all want to receive training even more strenuous than you got.

T-That's awesome!

You mean they all arrived at your place together, Kaio-sama?

May I speak to Goku?

Place your hand on my shoulder, and then talk.

Yo, do you hear me, Goku?

Yamucha!

We met the departed Kami-sama in the Next World, and he told us about this place.

Hey, we heard that you are going to Piccolo's homeworld, to look for the Dragon Balls, so that you can bring us back to life.

You said there were four of you, right?

Yamucha, Tenshinhan... and is Piccolo there, by any chance?

Yeah, Piccolo's here, too.

Hmph, my pride wouldn't allow for you to be the only one who got stronger.

Who is the other one? Is it Kami-sama?

No, not him. Kami-sama stayed in the Next World.

Get this, it's Chaozu!

Chaozu?! But Chaozu got blown to pieces. Is he all right?

Yeah. Kami-sama regenerated a body, especially for him.

That's awesome! Good for you, Chaozu!

I'll tell you, though, the gravity here has us beat.

Our bodies are so heavy, we can't even run properly.

Yeah, I know, I know.

But right now, I'm headed for this Planet Namek place, which has the Dragon Balls, and I've started training under much, much more intense gravity.

I have to get much stronger in the next five and a half days, or there's gonna be real big trouble.

Eh? What do you mean? What happened?

I was severely injured, so Kuririn, Bulma and Gohan went to Planet Namek to look for the Dragon Balls.

But once they got there, that Saiyan, Vegeta, was also there looking for the Dragon Balls.

--What?!
--S-So then, did they get themselves killed by him?!

No, it looks like Vegeta still ain't realized that Kuririn and the others are there.

But that ain't all, either.

There's something else, even more unbelievable.

There are apparently some other strange folks after the Dragon Balls.

The weird thing is, their outfits are just like Vegeta's.

What's more, one of them has a Ki far higher than Vegeta's.

W-What?!

What? What's going on?

By any chance, is his name Freeza?

I don't know. I ain't heard, but when I find out, I'll tell you.

If it is Freeza, this is a huge problem.

G-Goku, I'm going to look in on Planet Namek.

Please do, Kaio-sama!

Let's see, which direction is Planet Namek...?

Yamucha, tell us what's going on.

I-I do sense an enormous amount of Ki, all right.

Checking to see where this Ki is coming from...

Wha--?

Freeza!

What's this? Kaio-sama, you know who it is?

Goku, this time around, your opponent is too much for you.

Or I should say, he's the worst of the worst!

There is no way you can handle this guy!

What do you mean?

Listen to me, Goku. This is an order! Do not go near him!

Once you get to Planet Namek, take the other three aboard, and run away, immediately!

I'm not just saying this for your sake.

I'm saying this for Earth, Planet Namek, and all the other worlds.

If you launch a half-baked attack on him, and get him angry, something horrific will happen!

Leaving him alone is the only thing you can do!

Is he really all that great?
I'd kinda like to see him.

Don't you dare go near him!

--Yeah, but...
--No buts about it!

Goku, do whatever you have to to gather the Dragon Balls, and bring us back to life.

Piccolo!

I'm going to improve myself here even more than you did, and go to Planet Namek.

Together, we'll send that absurd what's-his-name bastard flying.

D-Don't be ridiculous! You guys don't know a thing about Freeza!

There's no time. Start training us, right away.

If you're planning to fight Freeza, I won't teach you anything!

Promise me that you won't go to Planet Namek.

All right.

You mean that, right? I'm trusting you.

That goes for you guys, too!

There's no way I'm going to keep a measly promise like that.

If I do the same training that Goku did, I won't be able to surpass him.

I'll have to work out the key points of the training, and then hone my techniques on my own.

All right, then, let's get started.

Here we go...

Let's do this!

First off, try to make me laugh with a pun.

I will train whoever can pass this test!

Even if I can't take any action, there ain't no harm in getting stronger.

All right, let's try kicking it all the way up to 50-times gravity!

Hey, if we keep flying at this rate, when will we reach the Grand Elder's place?

W-We should make it in another five hours.

Damn, I can't find anyplace that has multiple powers gathered together.

What does this mean?
Are there no more villages?

There are two powers on the move.

Strange. One of them feels different from both Freeza's men and the Namekians.

It's disconcerting. I think I'll go check it out.

Stop, Dende!

It's Vegeta! He's taken notice of us, all right!

He's headed straight this way at tremendous speed!

We have to hide, now!

Huh?

W-What happened? He changed direction.

There's another large Ki out there!
He went in that direction!

This power belongs to Zarbon!
No doubt about it!

I've been waiting for him to make a move on his own!

If only I had a Scouter, finding a village would be easy.

That's... Vegeta!

Yo! it's been quite a long while, hasn't it, Zarbon-san?

I've already disposed of Dodoria.
Now it's your turn.

What?! Y-You've disposed of Dodoria?

Easily.

I don't believe it.

You'll be able to tell once we go at it.
I'll show you how strong I am.

Vegeta, why would you turn against Freeza-sama?

That's simple. I never have liked that Freeza bastard.

Up to now, I've been forced into submission by his power, and had no choice but to do as he said, but now, by an odd turn of events, I've learned that I can gain eternal life.

You're talking about the Dragon Balls.

I'm not about to let Freeza have them!

Once eternal life is mine, I'm sure the chance to beat Freeza will come along.

What foolishness.

Do you think eternal life is all you need to beat Freeza?

It's a shame you don't have your Scouter.

By fighting many battles, I've increased my power more than you can imagine.

You're the one who doesn't understand.

Freeza-sama's power far transcends even that level.

That's enough of your mindless babbling!

I heard from Dodoria that Freeza was afraid of Saiyans!

I'm going to show you some Saiyan power, right now!

You've got such a swelled head.

What Freeza-sama was afraid of was the Saiyans banding together.

Just one of you can't do anything.

Well, we'll see about that.

What?!

To think that he could deflect that!

Incredible! it's Ki slamming against Ki!

Vegeta and someone else are mixing it up.

H-His opponent is probably that guy who was at Freeza's side.

Both of them are monsters.
There's no way I can compete with them.

Let's just hope the two of them end up crushing each other.

All right! Hold on to me tight!

This is our chance!
While those two are battling it out, we're going to rush to the Grand Elder!

If I fly all-out, we should reach there quickly!

Here we go!

What's the matter?!

For someone as fast as the great Zarbon-sama, you look like you're standing still!

What?!

To think that you'd be so helpless at this level!

You surprise me. You have indeed made outstanding progress.

However, as a result, you have awakened my true power, which has lain dormant for many years.

What? Your true power, which has lain dormant for many years?

Are you saying you've got such a thing?

That is correct.

That's a hilarious joke!

Before you die, I will tell you why I have let my true power remain dormant.

In order to display my true power, I must transform.

However, my transformed appearance is quite ugly.

As someone who prefers beauty, I cannot bear it. 
But I would rather choose to transform than choose death.

Transform, you say? The way we Saiyans do?

People who are backed into a corner will say the most ridiculous things out of desperation.

Hmph, I do not become unnecessarily large, like you Saiyans do.

My power just increases.

Overwhelmingly so!

Hey, it seems like a lot of time has gone by since we got to this planet, but the sun shows no sign of going down. Why is that?

The sun doesn't go down.

I mean, there are three suns, and they all come up in turn.

So then, there's no such thing as night on your world?

No, there isn't.

Well, okay then.

Let me see it.

You don't even need to ask.
I'll show you, right now!

W-What is this?!

My appearance isn't all that's transformed!

Get a load of my power now!

Hey, Dende, are we almost at the Grand Elder's house yet?

It's just a little farther ahead.

We have to do something while Vegeta and that other guy fight.

Damn it, I will not be beaten!

No matter how you struggle, you cannot beat me!

Incredible! Even as far away as we are, I can feel the Ki from their battle!

My power before I transformed doesn't compare to what I have now!

It's no use. I thought I had powered up on Earth, but...

You're not going to get an easy death!

Vegeta, have you met your end?

He's not showing himself. it would seem that he was unable to move, and ended up drowning.

Hmph, he put me to a lot of trouble.

He even made me perform my hated transformation.

Now then, I suppose I should report this to Freeza-sama.

Z-Zarbon! This isn't over yet!

I-I will become much, much stronger!

And then I will defeat both Zarbon and Freeza!

I-I won't let anyone have the Dragon Balls!


Kuririn's Power-Up! The Foreboding Squirming of Freeza"
  


There it is. You can see that tall rock there, right?

That's it?

That was a long way.

The Grand Elder is inside that house.

I'm surprised it's still here.
As conspicuous as this place is, it's only a matter of time before the bad guys find it.

He hasn't been done in already, right?

He couldn't be...

Nail-san! Thank goodness! You're all right, then!

H-He looks just like Piccolo!

I'm glad you made it here, Dende, and the visitor.

The Grand Elder already knows the gist of what's going on.

Then the Grand Elder sees what is happening?

That saves us the trouble of explaining everything.

Both of you, come inside.
The Grand Elder will see you.

U-Um, if you already know roughly what is going on, w-why haven't you left such a dangerous place as this?

The Grand Elder has grown too old.
He knows that his death is near.

There was nothing else we could do but let him remain here while I protect him.

I'd heard he was near his end, but I didn't know it was so serious.

Come, inside.

This guy can handle himself.

Compared to the other Namekians, I sense remarkable power from him.

Up above.

Right.

Grand Elder, Dende, and a visitor.

H-He's huge!

Welcome. You are an earthling, right?

First, I would like to express my gratitude for saving my child, Dende.

Thank you.

Er, not at all. I-l wasn't able to do all that much.

Whoa...!

I'm maxed out... I've gotta rest for a bit...

Still, I've mastered 50-times gravity a lot sooner than I thought.

Looks like my duel with Vegeta wasn't entirely for nothing, huh?

Because of those villains, most of my children on this world have been killed.

It grieves me.

They seem to be after the Dragon Balls, don't they?

Yes.

I never imagined that those globes of hope, a testament to the wisdom and power of the Namekians, would bring this about.

Forgive me for coming right to the point, but could I ask you to let me borrow that Dragon Ball above your head for a short while?

I will never give it to those guys. I promise.

You are collecting the Dragon Balls, too, are you?

Yes. I want to bring my fallen friends back to life.

I would like to request it, as well.

Grand Elder, if these people's friends return to life, they might be able to put down those evil men.

How do you know about the Dragon Balls?

We had them on Earth, as well.

You what?!

Long ago, during the crisis on this world, there was a Namekian who fled to Earth.

He created our Dragon Balls.

Ah, yes, I remember now.
That was the child of Katattsu.

What a surprise. To think that he safely arrived on Earth.

He was a gifted Dragon-type child, who could create Dragon Balls.

He was also killed, along with the rest of our friends, by a Saiyan named Vegeta, who has come here.

The Saiyans are indeed formidable.
That poor child prodigy...

That Saiyan wouldn't happen to be a Super Saiyan, would he?

W-What is that?

G-Gentleman from Earth, could I ask you to come over here?

Sure...

Please allow me to explore a little of Earth's past.

P-Past?

Oh, my goodness! Evil entered into him, and his body was split into two.

So in order for him to become Kami, he could not have even the slightest evil sentiment.

As a result, the evil Piccolo was born.

However, it is a pity.

Imagine, him halving his prodigious inborn powers like that.

If he had become one again, like he originally was, he may have made it through without dying.

O-One again?

Well, I suppose it's all right. 
Your desires are pure, after all.

Your courage up to now is greatly esteemed.

I shall give you this Dragon Ball.

Terrific!

Thank you very much.

So this is an original Dragon Ball.

It sure is big.

However, your wish is not likely to be granted.

Why not?

Unfortunately, my life will only last a few more days.

Can you steal the balls already gathered by those villains in that time?

More than likely, it will be quite impossible. Once I die...

Grand Elder!

...the Dragon Balls will also be extinguished.

It's all right! We have no choice!

For the time being, I will protect this Dragon Ball with my life!

It's far better than letting those guys have eternal life, after all.

If you'd be so kind. I no longer have the strength to protect it.

I'll make sure to!

You possess exceptional power.

It's a shame you still have so much power left dormant.

Dormant power?

Allow me to release that power.

No way, I couldn't have that kind of power left.

I've trained quite extensively, after all...

Even now, I'm beyond my limits!

Please find a way to somehow escape their clutches.

The power... the power...!

The power is starting to gush forth!

Incredible!

U-Unbelievable! it feels like I've been reborn!

Thank you very much!

U-Um... can you call forth anyone's power?

Like say, from a small child?

It is possible for anyone, as long as they have dormant power.

If you do this too much, will it shorten your life?

All I do is provide the trigger.

It has nothing to do with my lifespan.

W-Would it be all right if I brought another one of my friends here?

He's sure to have an enormous amount of dormant power.

Then bring him here.

The more powerful people we have on the side of right, the better.

Right! I will bring him here right away!

U-Um, what about this?

Please take it with you.

I leave the future of this world, and the universe, in your hands.

Dende, you wait here. 
I'll be right back with Gohan.

P-Please be careful.

Mm-hmm.

This is awesome! Who'd have thought I had this kind of power?

I should be able to pick up Gohan in just a few hours like this!

H-How can this be?

A village that we haven't attacked yet has already been wiped out!

If I submerge this Dragon Ball here, no one will be able to find it.

I have to get that Dragon Ball back, no matter what...

What happened? Who did this to you?

T-The Saiyan took our Dragon Ball...it was Vegeta, all right.

T-The Dragon Ball...

Die already, will you?

Freeza-sama, it is Zarbon.

Enter.

Did you find a village?

No. As of this moment, I have not found any villages, but I did defeat Vegeta.

Ho, did you? Then Zarbon-san, you transformed?

The first time in a long while?

--Yes, sir.
--So, is Vegeta dead?

Well, I did not exactly check for his corpse, but if, by some slim chance, he is still alive, he would be gravely injured.

Why did you not confirm that he was dead?!

W-Well, Vegeta was submerged under the water, so...

You could have gone under the water, correct?

You failed to confirm that he was dead because you dislike getting wet.

Also, you were rash to have killed him right away in the first place.

What if Vegeta has concealed a Dragon Ball from us someplace?

I-I am terribly sorry. I will go check at once.

Freeza-sama!

I have discovered a village!

H-However, the village has already been wiped out!

What did you say?

I think it was most likely the work of Vegeta.

Then he does have a Dragon Ball somewhere after all!

There was one villager still alive, but I disposed of him at once.

Then you killed our one and only witness?

S-Sir...?

I dislike hasty, unwise actions more than anything.

If Vegeta is dead, then you had better prepare yourself, as well.

Bring Vegeta back here at once.

This time, you should set your hopes on him being alive.

Appule!

Yes, sir?

Contact Planet Freeza, and inform the Ginyu Special Corps that they are to report here.

And needless to say, tell them to bring Scouters, as well.

They should arrive in five days.

Understood!

F-Freeza-sama, why bring in the Ginyu Special Corps?

Forgive me for saying so, but I believe that there is absolutely no reason to call them in.

I am getting an unusual foreboding.

W-What kind of foreboding?

I have considered this for a little while now, but I have gotten the feeling that a powerful Saiyan has grown up, who will become my enemy in time.

At first, I thought it was Vegeta, but it would seem that I am wrong.

A-Are you sure you aren't imagining things?

As far as Saiyans go, except for Vegeta, there is only that what's-his-name on Earth, and his son.

And their battle powers are supposed to be lower than Vegeta's.

Are you telling me that my foreboding is misplaced?

--N-No, sir!
--Never mind that.

I would like you to bring Vegeta back here at once.

Y-Yes, sir!

The Ginyu Special Corps...

Saiyans do indeed appear to possess fathomless battle power.

Every time they battle, it rises greatly.

Of course, they are no match for me, but thinking ahead to the future, I have to nip this in the bud now, while I can.

It would be most inopportune if one of them became a Super Saiyan.

I slept pretty good. I wonder how long I was asleep.

It's no use! I'm so worn out, I can't move at all!

Damn it...

I am not... going to die...!

W-What's this? He's still alive?

You're a tough one.

But then, this time, it's because you're tough that I'll be spared.

We're going to treat you. You're lucky.

Say, Gohan-kun, look at this!

One of the Dragon Balls started moving.

It's coming straight toward us.

Could that be Kuririn-kun?

That must be it! Hooray!

I'm sure he saw the Grand Elder, and got his ball!

Hold on a second. Then what is this other one, here?

These five here are probably the ones that that Freeza guy has, right?

But look, there's one right here, all alone.

Huh? You're right, and it's close to here.

Let's see... in that direction, right?

We said that Vegeta was attacking a village, remember?

It's in that direction!

B-But Vegeta isn't there.

I can't sense his Ki.

I get it! He attacked the village, but wasn't able to find the Dragon Ball!

Mm-hmm.

He must have figured it wasn't there, and went off someplace else.

Please let me borrow the Radar. 
I'm going to go get that Dragon Ball.

Way to go! We caught a bit of luck, ourselves!

--Well?
--His condition is quite serious, sir.

His vital signs are extremely weak, and even if he completely recovers from his injuries,

I can't be sure he'll ever regain consciousness.

Bring him around, no matter what it takes!

Do everything possible for him! Got it?!

Y-Yes, sir.

Otherwise, it will mean my life.

Great, great! Now's my chance!

I don't sense the Ki of anyone scary nearby!


The Conspiracy Completely Shatters! Vegeta's Counterattack vs. Zarbon" 
  


You've taken quite a bit of damage.

This could take a while.

Come on. if you don't regain consciousness, I'm the one that Freeza is gonna take it out on.

That should do it. Now I just have to wait until you wake up.

How is Vegeta?

Sir, he should be regaining consciousness shortly.

That is good, is it not?

Y-Yes, sir.

W-What was that explosion?!

It cannot be...!

Looks like you underestimated my recuperative ability.

Now then...

Damn! it came from the treatment room, all right!

Zarbon-san, quickly!

Oh, no! He fled outside!

He did what?!

Good! Freeza is with him!

Quickly! Quickly, go after him!

W-Why, you...!

Quickly! Find him no matter what!
He could not have gotten very far!

Fools. You fell for that all too easily.

Dear Freeza-sama, Right now, as of this moment, your reign is at an end.

Your beloved Vegeta.

I win!

Let's see...it's around here.

H-How awful.

I'm sure Vegeta must have done this.

Where are you? Where are you?!

Where did you run off to, Vegeta?!

He couldn't have gotten away that quickly.

He must be hiding somewhere.

You still have not found him, Zarbon-san?!

If you have the nerve to allow him to get away from you like this, you will die to take responsibility.

Fool! Keep searching around outside all you like!

One... two... three... four...

All five of them are here, all right.

They didn't just heal my injuries, they're going to have every last one of their Dragon Balls stolen by me, as well.

But I can't get away cleanly carrying all five of them.

What's more, I don't have much time to think.

All right...

Please, let this work!

Hey! You fell for it! I'm still inside the ship!

--Wha...?
--He's what?!

D-Damn him!

Now!

Where is Vegeta?!

D-Do not tell me that Vegeta is after the Dragon Balls!

All right! Now for me!

T-The Dragon Balls!

T-That bastard!

W-Where is he this time?!

F-Freeza-sama, could he still be inside the spaceship?

Find him!

Y-Yes, sir!

If I were to foolishly flee by air, Freeza would catch up to me in no time.

What a disgrace!

Not only did you let Vegeta escape, but he has the Dragon Balls, too!

There is no way he could have escaped in a flash carrying all five Dragon Balls!

I shall search inside the spaceship.

You will thoroughly look around outside!

--Yes, sir.
--L trust you are ready to answer for this.

If one hour passes, and you are unable to bring Vegeta back here...

Y-Yes, sir...

Huh? This way?

Not inside one of the houses?

I get it! Not even Vegeta would have found it inside the lake.

I did it!

Here it is, here it is!

I'm sure they must have landed around here somewhere.

There they are! There they are!

Outstanding control, if I do say so myself!

Take that, Freeza!

I've finally gotten his Dragon Balls!

Now, if you include the one I sunk by that village, I only need one more to have all seven!

There's a strong battle power...! Is that Zarbon?!

No, it's not. The battle power is lower than Zarbon's.

I-Is that...?

Just you wait, Gohan! Once you go to the Grand Elder's place, you'll become much, much stronger!

It's that earthling!

W-What's he doing on Planet Namek?

What's more, he was carrying the last Dragon Ball.

Luck is on my side from top to bottom!

That was fast! I'm almost there!

It looks like that earthling is after the Dragon Balls, too.

But I will be taking the one you're carrying!

Now I'll have all seven of the Dragon Balls!

D-Damn it, Vegeta! Where are you?!

If only I had a Scouter, it would be easy to find you!

The way things are going, my life will be forfeit to Freeza-sama.

Is that Vegeta?!

No. That's the guy who came to the rescue of that Namekian kid.

But he's carrying what looks like a Dragon Ball.

Vegeta!

I've found you at last! You're all mine now!

There's a tremendous battle power following me.

Looks like Zarbon found me.

Tch, what a pesky bastard.

Still, this is a good opportunity.
I'll put him away for sure this time.

He's completely heartened by our last battle. He'll be off guard.

Huh?

It's you, Kuririn-kun! Don't startle me!

T-This is dangerous, isn't it, Bulma-san?

If you stay outside, casually reading a book like that, they're going to spot you.

What are you talking about?! if I stay inside the cave the whole time...

I-Is that, by any chance, a Dragon Ball?

Bingo!

The home-soil Dragon Balls are huge, aren't they?

The Grand Elder was quite reasonable.

Oh, right, right! Bulma-san, is Gohan inside the house?

I want to take him to see the Grand Elder, too.

He went to go find another Dragon Ball.

It showed up on the Radar.

Near that village that Vegeta attacked, remember?

Really?

A-A Ki! it's headed this way, and it's almost here!

It's Gohan-kun! That was fast, huh?

No, it's not Gohan!

V-Vegeta!

Crap! I was so carried away with becoming stronger,

I didn't notice his Ki!

I wouldn't have expected to meet you here, earthlings.

I didn't think you had the technology it took to travel to this planet.

Judging by the Dragon Ball you're so delicately holding, it would seem that we have the same objective.

Listen up. Before I take that Ball from you, there's something I have to do.

But you'd better not get any funny ideas, like taking that and running away with it.

It won't be just you that dies, but the woman, as well.

So, you're here.

W-Who is that guy? Judging from his face, I wonder if he isn't our knight in shining armor.

N-No way...

T-This is as bad as it gets!

What's as bad as it gets? He's a pretty fine-looking man, isn't he?

Please don't go judging people by their appearances at a time like this!

But usually, the hunk is the good guy.

This is not Earth, it's Planet Namek.

I know that.

Bulma-san, you don't understand anything.

You've done quite a job of mocking me, Vegeta-san.

I see. I also recognize that little runt holding the Dragon Ball.

You guys are together, are you?

Yoo-hoo!

Yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo!
Stick it to Vegeta, okay?

Hmph, yeah, right.

It doesn't matter to me.

Vegeta, where did you hide the remaining Dragon Ball?

I'm going to bring you before Freeza-sama, and make you tell us.

Just try it.

You'll never learn.

Don't you mess with me!

If this keeps up...

Hmph, you're finally getting into it, huh?

He's a bad guy, all right!

W-What is this?! He turned into a monster!

And what's more, his power shot up like crazy!

You fell for it, Zarbon!

Damn it!

Bulma-san, now's our chance!
Let's get out of here!

But he said he'd kill us if we ran!

We'll be killed if we don't run! Hurry!

Oh, no you don't!

Damn! Nothing gets past him!

I'm sensing two incredible Ki!

They're coming from where Bulma-san is waiting for me!

Vegeta, how dare you...?

Looks like that took quite a toll.

Your strength has dropped considerably, hasn't it?

Zarbon-san, your death would appear to be at hand.

My death is near?

Don't make me laugh! My battle power is higher than yours!

Zarbon-san, I thought you were supposed to be well acquainted with Saiyans, weren't you?

You were wrong to have carelessly treated me after I came close to dying. isn't that right?

Every time a Saiyan recovers after being near death, they are able to rapidly raise their battle power.

So that's it. Come to think of it, Goku also got stronger after each intense battle.

Damn, so that's why Vegeta's Ki rose so much, is it?

I don't care how much you've raised your battle power, there's no way you can beat me when I'm transformed, and am able to exhibit my true power!

The Saiyans are a warrior race!
Don't mess with us!

V-Vegeta... I-I was just following Freeza-sama's orders...

Let me go... p-please...

After all the time you've spent pushing me around, don't you dare go asking anything for yourself!

I-I know... Let's team up together...if we do that, we could beat even Freeza...!



A Hair-Trigger Pinch! Gohan, Protect the Four Star Ball" 
  


if we could defeat Freeza just by teaming up, it would be too easy.

Now then...I don't know how you did it, but you seem to have raised your battle power somewhat beyond what it was on Earth, haven't you?

However, it still isn't at the level where you could fight me as an equal. What will it be?
I don't suppose you feel like quietly handing over that Ball?

I-I doubt it would do any good to make any promises with you, but if I give this to you, will you leave without making any trouble?

A promise, huh? Well, all right.

As long as I get the Dragon Ball, there's no sense in playing around with you guppies.

Y-You mean it?

Don't push it. Hand it over before I change my mind, unless you really do want to get killed.

K-Kuririn-kun...

You guys are lucky.

I'm in a good mood, because I've found all seven Balls.

Now I'll be the one to rule the universe, instead of Freeza.

I am going to gain eternal life.

Kuririn-kun, you gave it to him pretty readily, considering, huh?

And after all the trouble you went through to get that Dragon Ball, too.

He said that was the last one, so it's all over now.

If I hadn't given it to him, he definitely would have killed us.

It's near-miraculous that the two of us are still alive.

Besides, it was probably safe to let him have that Ball.

The Dragon Ball that Gohan went looking for has to be the one that Vegeta hid, to keep that Freeza bastard from getting all seven of them.

Oh, yeah! Gohan-kun has to have found that Dragon Ball by now, and is now headed this way, right?

That means that things didn't go the way Vegeta planned, did they?

Mm-hmm... so long as Vegeta doesn't find Gohan, that is.

Something's coming from directly ahead!

It's a very strong Ki!

Vegeta!

Hmm? Suddenly, I sense a strong battle power, directly ahead.

Have to mask my Ki!

Its presence just vanished! impossible!

I know it was around here.

Vegeta, hurry up and get out of here!

Who's there?! Come on out!
I know you're out there!

Show yourself now, or I'll blow this entire area away!

He wouldn't!

What are you waiting for? Huh?!

All right, maybe it would be better to jump out and fight Vegeta.

But then...

Gohan, there's no way we can stand against Vegeta right now.

Sure enough, I've got to protect this Dragon Ball.

You're not going to come out, are you?

All right!

As you wish! I'll blow you away!

Rats!

Wait!

Please, don't let him find this.

I-It's me!

Kakarrot's son, huh? I wouldn't have thought that was possible.

Those other earthlings were here, though.

It's no surprise that you'd be here, too.

A Dragon Ball!

D-Don't tell me that's...!

Hmph, this? it was a present, from that slick-headed friend of yours.

Y-You killed Kuririn-san, didn't you?!

I can still go back there again and kill him, if you want me to.

Be grateful. To celebrate getting all the Dragon Balls together, I let him live.

A-All of the Dragon Balls...

Hey, what's that you've got in your hand?

This is a clock!

Hmph, a clock, huh? I'm surprised that with a scientific capacity that can't make a clock any smaller than that, you even got to this world.

Who asked you?!

By the way, is that Kakarrot bastard here, too?

No, he isn't! We didn't know there would be bad men like you here!

Hmph, is that right?

That's a shame, isn't it?

The three of us are the last of the Saiyans.

Listen, when you get back to Earth, give him a message for me.

Tell him I'll be coming to Earth soon, and this time, I'll blow him and the Earth away for sure.

You must be missing your mother's milk by this time.

Hurry on back to Earth, now.

T-T-That hurt...

S-Still......the Dragon Ball is safe.

Ka......me... ha... me......Ha!!

S-Senzu... senzu... senzu, senzu...

Whew, I have to be more careful.

I caught a glimpse of the Next World, there.

If I die, I can't train, or nothing else.

I'll get there in a little more than two days.

Well, guess I'll keep at it for a while longer.

Damn... isn't he here yet?

Kuririn-kun, I collapsed the house back into a Capsule.

Isn't Gohan-kun here yet?

I-I still don't see him.

You don't think Vegeta found him, do you?

Vegeta knows about this place now.

We have to change locations, fast!

What could Gohan be doing?! Hurry! Hurry!

Kuririn-san!

He's here!

Kuririn-san, I found this!

You did it! We've been waiting for that!

Gohan-kun, way to go!

Gohan, I'll explain things later, but we have to get away from here, fast, or we could be in hot water.

I've got a pretty good idea.
I was spotted by Vegeta, too.

But I managed to hide the Dragon Ball, so I got away without him finding it.

You got pretty lucky, too, huh?

Kuririn-kun, Gohan-kun, let's just hurry out of here!

Right.

This is the lake. This is where I submerged the Dragon Ball.

Once I get it out of here...

I'll have all seven Dragon Balls together.

Take that, Freeza! As of this moment, the entire universe is mine!

That's strange. I'm sure it sunk right around here.

It's gone! Impossible!

I-It was him!

The spot where I ran into that kid was exactly midway between here and the cave those earthlings were at!

That miserable brat!

But how did he find the Dragon Ball?

This is a clock!

That was no clock! It was a radar!

Damn it...!

You earthling punks!

Mess with me, will you?! You'll pay for this!

Damn it all!

Damn it all!!

Where are you, you punks?!
Get out here, or you'll be sorry!

Damn it! You're gone, are you?!

Damn it, I can't sense their presence, either.

Those punks can control their presence all the way down to zero.

I can't find them like this.

You miserable earthlings!
That was an insolent stunt you pulled!

But then, they're also sure to come after the six Dragon Balls that I have at some point.

And when they do...

it's all right. He won't find us here.

Hold on, I can't even set up the house in a place this narrow, you know!

Please, don't ask the impossible.

There aren't going to be very many caves like that last one here.

Just tough it out until Father gets here, Bulma-san.

So until Son-kun gets here, a lady like me is going to have to stay here, in a place that doesn't even have a bathroom, with you two?

Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

I'm going to be taking Gohan with me, and heading back to where the Grand Elder is.

Huh? Why is that?

What is this?! You mean you're going to be leaving me here by myself?!

Please, just bear with us.
Once Gohan sees the Grand Elder, it's possible that he might become strong enough to rival even Vegeta!

He sure is taking his time.

What has Zarbon-san been doing these past few days?

Seeing as how he has not returned, he has either fled, or been killed.

If I had known it would be like this, I would have brought the Ginyu Special Corps along from the start.

Damn it.

If that device the kid was carrying really is something that can find Dragon Balls......I can't be too careful about leaving this spot.

Those guys want these six.

I'll just have to wait for them to make their move.

Freeza appears to be pretty frustrated.

I knocked out the engine of his spaceship, which means he's stuck here.

Confounded Vegeta...!

W-What is with these earthquakes that just started up?

Oh, brother, I can't take any more of this crazy planet!

Even supposing he called for someone to bring more Scouters, at best, it will take a few days for them to arrive.

I have to settle this before then.

If I can just achieve eternal life with the Dragon Balls, then depending on my tactics, I'm sure I can defeat Freeza!

Now, when he doesn't have any Scouters, is my chance!

Damn it, at this speed, it will take us quite a while to reach him.

But if we use any more Ki than this, that bastard Vegeta will find us for sure.

He seems to have gotten even stronger.

As it stands, even if we both went at him, there's no way we'd win.

But then, are you sure I have the kind of power that would rival Vegeta's?

I don't think I do.

Nah, I had this much dormant power.

So I think that we can expect quite a lot out of you, with your Saiyan blood.

More likely than not.

Kaio-ken!!

All right...

Ka......me......ha......me......Ha!!

Yikes!

That was a close one!

But then, my body has gotten a lot tougher.

Freeza-sama!

We've just received a message from the Ginyu Special Corps!

They are just passing by 36Y47X, and should be arriving shortly.

Understood.

They are finally about to arrive, are they?

Seeing as how, fortunately, nothing has happened, it would appear that Vegeta was unable to collect all seven of the Dragon Balls.

Never forget, once the Ginyu Special Corps brings those Scouters, I will be able to find you anywhere.



The Super Decisive Battle Draws Near! The Ginyu Special-Squad Has Arrived!"   


It's been almost four days now.
Is it much farther?

Yeah, there still is a way to go.
Damn, the Grand Elder is dying!

All right...

Let's try picking up the pace dramatically.

As far away as we are now, there's no way Vegeta will notice us.

You're right. Besides, Father will be here soon, too.

That settles it! Let's fly at full speed!

Right!

If we fly at this speed, we'll be there in an hour.

Right!

I've finally found them!

There are two presences--Kakarrot's son, and the runt he's with.

I thought that they would be coming here, to take my Dragon Balls, but they're pretty far away, instead.

I don't know what they're up to, but if I pass up this opportunity, I doubt I'll have another chance to get the location of the last remaining Dragon Ball out of them.

If I take this one with me, then even if that woman locates this place with her strange device, she still won't get all seven of them.

All right!

You're going to pay this time for sure! Say your prayers!

9,999 ...

10,000 ...!

Awesome! Most of my fatigue is gone!

I've even surprised myself!

All right, then, that's it for my training.

I'll rest up good with the time I have left.

I have to get used to normal gravity, too.

Wow! I'm so light!

What a surprise! I'm so light, it's like I ain't even here!

Light! Light!

So light! So light! So light, I say!

And so strong, so strong!

Strong! Strong! Strong! Strong!

After training myself this hard, I'm sure I could withstand even a times-ten Kaio-ken!

"Shampoo"

I'm almost to Planet Namek, huh?

All right, let's do this! Let's do this!

Oh, that was relaxing!

Now then, all that remains is to sleep tight.

But before I do that...

Let's see... here we go.

Huh? This is the wrong one.

This one's bitter, after all.
Let's see... here it is, here it is!

This one, this one! Bulma's daddy's specially made sports drink!

Goku hadn't realized that somewhere along the way, he had gained a level of power great enough to overcome the limits of his Saiyan capabilities.

Hang in there, Gohan!
The Grand Elder's place is just up ahead!

Right!

I know I said that once we have the Grand Elder release Gohan's dormant powers, he would be a match for Vegeta......but to be honest, I don't think we can hope for that much.

That bastard really is gifted.

He keeps getting stronger, with no end in sight.

Once we get Gohan stronger, we'll have to wait for Goku to arrive, and then the three of us will have to take him on.

I'm almost there...
I'm almost there, you dirty punks!

Gohan, it's within sight!

Do you see it? That tall peak!
That's where he is!

All right, we're in the home stretch!

G-Gohan, a Ki! There's a Ki coming up behind us!

I-It can't be!

D-Don't tell me it's Vegeta!

Gohan...

I'll stall him here with everything I've got.

You go on ahead to where the Grand Elder is!

--But...
--Hurry it up! Go get yourself made stronger!

Okay?

Right!

All right...

I'll just have to do what I can.

What speed!

Yo!

I-I'm surprised you could detect us.

Of course I did. I'm not like you guys.

Now, why don't you return that four-starred Dragon Ball that I had hidden?

Take me for a fool, will you?

What in the world do you mean?

Keep playing dumb. 
I'll make you talk in a hurry.

Oh... this is incredible...

What's that?

That mountain, where Kakarrot's son ran to...

There's something else there, too.

Is that where you've hidden the Ball?

N-No!

W-Wait!

You possess such tremendous latent ability.

You are an earthling, aren't you?

Excuse me, but could I ask you to hurry?

He is here.

What is this place?

Wait, Vegeta!

Please wait!

--Leave.
--Hmph, sounds like you want to die.

All right! Gohan's Ki just went up!

I get it. Kakarrot is here, is he?

All right, today's the day we settle our score!

Come on out, Kakarrot!

What?!

I-It's you? What did you do in there?

Why has your base power risen so dramatically?

Sure, your battle power may have risen beyond comparison to what it used to be, but still...

You want to tangle with me, at your level?

Fine.

Grand Elder!

--D-Dende...
--Yes?

G-Go and tell the others at once...

There is a great, unknown power approaching Namek.

--Grand Elder!
--H-Hurry...

R-Right!

L-Listen! The Grand Elder says that someone else is approaching the planet!

--What?
--Grand Elder? Who's that?

You're right. Something really is coming.

I-It's an incredible power!

It's Goku! Goku is finally arriving!

What?!

I'm not so sure. it feels like there's more than one...

I-It can't be!

1... 2... 3... 4... 5...

N-No doubt about it!

Freeza has called in the Ginyu Special Corps!

Damn it!

You guys, give me your Dragon Ball, right now!

N-No! We won't do that!

I'll make you a promise!
After I obtain the power of immortality, I'll never lay a hand on you!

Hurry up, or there won't be any undoing what happens!

Y-You can't fool us!

If we did that, we'd be playing right into your hands!

Listen to me closely, you filthy bastards.

The Ginyu Special Corps that Freeza has called in consists of men as strong as I am-- no, maybe even stronger-- and there are five of them!

They're going to use new, cutting-edge Scouters to find me and you, and then come to kill us, right away!

You can't mean that!

Can't you sense their power?!
There's only one course of action!

The course that involves making me immortal, and defeating them!

What he is saying might be true.

There are indeed five evil powers out there.

Damn...

Then... let's make Gohan immortal...

He may have the power, but tactically, he's completely inexperienced!

B-But then, if we do this, then why the hell did we even...

The Dragon Balls will grant you three wishes.

Your wish is sure to be granted.

Three? Not just one?

Th-Three...

You guys!

Would you quit going on about this?! Hurry it up!

We may already be out of time!

H-Hey, you're sure... you're sure we can get three wishes granted?

Mm-hmm.

Follow me!

But just remember, we're gonna hold you to that promise!

Wait for me!

Damn it all!

Fly as fast as you can!

So, they've left.

Yes. However, even if it works, their chances of winning are extremely low.

--Nail-san...
--Nail...

...you go with them, too. 
You can be of some help.

--But...
--L will be all right.

My life should hold out a little longer.

Very well.

So, the Ginyu Special Corps has finally arrived.

I have been waiting for this.

Aren't we there yet?! They've already landed!

A little farther...

Why did this have to happen to me?

What in the world was that?! Huh?

Bulma-san, we're taking the Dragon Ball with us.

All right, hurry! This way, now!

H-Hey! Just what is going on?!

Gohan-kun!

Hey! Fill me in before you leave!

Do you have any idea how hard I'm having it here?!

Of all the...!

Boy, those guys are... Hmm?

H-Huh? Wasn't that Vegeta with them just now?

Special Corps! Special Corps!
Special Corps! Special Corps!

ReaCoom!

Butta!

Jheese!

Ghurd!

Special Corps! Special Corps!
Special Corps! Special Corps!

Ginyu!

To...ge...ther...we...are...

The Ginyu Special Corps!

I-I have been expecting you.



The Special-Squad's Frontline Man! Break Gurudo's Spell"   




Well done, everyone.
I have been expecting you.

Thank you very much, Freeza-sama.

Please tell us what our mission is this time.

The traitor Vegeta has taken the Dragon Balls that I had gathered and run away with them.

Please rough him up without killing him and bring him back here.

I would like to force out of him the location where he hid the Dragon Balls.

That is a simple task. Our Scouters have already picked up Vegeta.

He appears to be passing through an area not too far from here.

Is something the matter?

Who might these two who are with him be?

They appear to have considerably high battle powers.

Two of them?

Ah, those must be the children who interfered with us before.

So, they are working together after all.

What shall we do?

You are to kill them.

Very well. We will thoroughly enjoy ourselves.

Freeza-sama, the Scouters you ordered are in this case.

Good work.

We will take our leave now!

Special Corps!!

Ginyu!!

Fight!!

They're on the move!

Th-They're fast...! Hurry! They're catching up!

5 minutes to arrival on Planet Namek...5 minutes to arrival...

Kaio-sama didn't have to send me this many!

Someone even more incredible than Vegeta, huh?

Be alive, guys.

Ten more minutes.

It's strange. I don't feel any fear.

Why am I so calm?

Even with someone so unheard-of down there...I ain't feeling nothing.

Maybe training in all that gravity has made me go crazy.

Over there!

We've got them!

Yo, Veggie-chan!

Long time no see, huh?

Damn! I was so close, too!

By any chance, is that one of those Dragon Ball things?

Hmm? There are five of them over here.

Freeza-sama will be thrilled about this.

You have to have all seven Dragon Balls gathered together, right?

There are five behind us, and the two you're carrying.

That's all of them, isn't it?

V-Vegeta was telling us the truth.

I wouldn't offer any challenge against them.

And even among those guys, he's in a whole different league.

I-I'm not about to let you have them!

He, at least, isn't all that big a deal.

W-Why is he mixed in with the others?

Stay back! I can't stand your stink.

--Die!
--Whoa...

Don't go off on your own, Ghurd.

We haven't yet decided that he's your kill.

Why don't you hand it over already, Veggie-chan?

Although, even if you give it up, nice and easy, we aren't planning to go easy on you.

You guys may be able to search for people with those things, but I bet you can't find these!

And what if we can't?

This is what!

--Welcome home.
--I'm back.

Wha--?!

Th-That's impossible...!

It looks like you were trying to throw it far away. That's too bad.

Unfortunately for you, Butta has the greatest speed in the universe.

Now then, for the other one...

Destroy it!

Damn it!

The Dragon Ball...

How...?

So then the rumors are true?!

What rumors are those?

That Ghurd is able to control time momentarily, and can even stop it.

Th-That can't be for real!

Oh, yes, it's for real.

So then, that's all of them.

And now it's your turn. Be sure to take extra good care of them.

When he says to take care of you, he doesn't mean to pat your heads and play upsie-daisy with you.

He means to beat you up!

You don't have to explain that to them!

Vegeta, is fighting our only option here?

You've figured out that running away won't do any good, right?

Having you here is better than nothing.

Even knowing that the real strength you showed me on Earth will still be useless here, I'm counting on it!

I will take Vegeta. I'll let the rest of you rock-paper-scissors over who gets those two unknown runts.

Huh?! That's no fair, Commander!

You took the lion's share last time, too, you know! You can't do this!

Sheesh... What am I to do? All right.

Then, I'll take the Dragon Balls to Freeza-sama, and you guys handle the rest on your own.

Yahoo!

I'm nice to you guys, right?!

Yeah! You're the best!

Okay, then Vegeta is first, and second... Those guys are a set.

All right, let's go!

Ginyu rock-paper-scissors!

Rock-paper-scissors!

Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

--Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
--Are you sure we couldn't run away right now?

Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

Tie, go again!

Yeah! I get Vegeta!

Tch, I get the two runts, huh?

Don't let it get you down.
It's better than not going at all, right?

I'll tell you what, I'll let you strike the final blow.

Freeza-sama will now be able to obtain immortality.

I won't let you have them!

Stop! Don't waste your energy!

Never mind him, just concentrate on defeating these guys right now!

Hey, come here a minute.

Oh, what's this, a strategy session?

That Ghurd guy that you'll be fighting has a low battle power, but he uses supernatural powers.

Keep your guard up.

Yeah.

By the way, is it true that Kakarrot isn't here on this planet?

No, he isn't. But he is headed here.

Hurry up and get here!
He may drive me up the wall, but if we had him on our side, it would increase our strength.

Why in the world did we come to this faraway place, anyway?

Not only did we not get all the Dragon Balls together, but now the bad guys are going to gain eternal life.

I hate to say this, but Ghurd, you go on ahead first.

Sheesh, I feel like the guy who has to clean up the playing field.

What's a guy to do?

Hmph, you're the same screwed-up bunch as ever!

Gohan, remember the image training we did on the spaceship!

Right, Kuririn-san!

Aww, this looks like it's gonna be over in the blink of an eye.

--All right, let's go!
--Mm-hmm!

Unleash your Ki!

W-What is this?

F-Fools!

Stop!!

Those punks...

Th-They're gone!

W-Where are they?!

There they are! They moved that far?!

They relocated in that brief moment?

D-Damn, I can't hold my breath any longer!

Those little maggots are better than we thought, aren't they?

Huh, with these Scouter ratings...

To think that they can alter their battle powers without transforming.

They're an unusual race.

Nice friends you've got there, huh, Vegeta-chan?

Their speed and power defy comparison to what they were when I fought them before. Even so...

Amazing!

Your destructive force is several times greater than before, Gohan!

It's all thanks to the Grand Elder raising my power to its maximum!

Still, he ran all the way over there!

He must have stopped time again. Let's go, Gohan!

Right!

Th-They disappeared!

Damn it!

Stop!!

They've already made it this close?!

W-Wait, I don't have to run away.

All right, first I'll take out that little runt!

Oh, crap!

Over there!

Kamehame-Ha!!

Aw, geez! We were so close, too!

Hey there, Ghurd.

Looking pretty ragtag there.

You're disgracing the Ginyu Special Corps, you know.

Ghurd, you dummy! if you let yourself get beaten by those runts, we're not going to play with you anymore!

And we'll take our snacks separate from you!

I-I just dropped my guard a little bit!

I'll finish off these maggots right away!

All right, now's our chance!
Let's take it to him, Gohan!

Right!

Here they come again!

All right...! At this point, I'll play my ace-in-the-hole!

W-What is this...?

I-I can't move my body...!

It's my paralyzing spell.

You can't move, no matter how hard you struggle!

D-Damn...!

Where's all that energy you had a moment ago?

Looks like Ghurd is really feeling the heat.

He's using his paralysis spell.
He hardly ever uses that one.

And against those two little bugs, too.

I'm going to get you back good for embarrassing me!

Hey! I'm gonna skewer you guys!

You might taste good if I grill you up!

Yeah, I'll bet you'd like to escape.

Th-Those fools!

They go and attack him head-on, even after I told them to watch out for his supernatural powers!

What's the matter? Hurry up and run away, or this huge skewer is gonna run right through you!

You can't move? Oh, you poor fellows.

All right, after I take care of the one in the gold-colored outfit with this, I'll do in the other one with a different supernatural power!

G-Gohan... can't you do anything...?

I-It's no use... My nerves are paralyzed...

Here goes!

I've been released from my paralysis!

Th-That was a dirty trick, Vegeta!

This was supposed to be a fight between me and those kids!

You guys decided that on your own.

And do you think there's any such thing as fair play in war?

T-To think that I would be beaten by a lowdown monkey of a Saiyan!

That really pops my cork!

Ha! You're the last person I need to hear that from.

Imagine, us being rescued by you...

Thank you.

Hmph, don't get the wrong idea.

Do you think I deliberately saved you?

It was just the perfect chance for me to defeat that grimy Ghurd.

This is no time to zone out.

Brace yourselves. We won't get lucky this time.

Hey, hey, hey! Ghurd went and got himself killed!

W-What do we do?!

With one of us missing, our Ginyu Special Corps' Fighting Pose will be less than beautiful!

ReaCoom!

Butta!

Jheese!

Ginyu Special Corps!

I-It's less than beautiful, all right.

We'll have to get Commander Ginyu to think up another pose for just the four of us!

Leaving that aside, we have to decide who gets to take those two runts in Ghurd's place.

Well, I get Vegeta.

All right, Jheese, rock-paper-scissors me!

--Yeah!
--First one is rock!

Rock-paper-scissors!

Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

--Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!...
--W-What are those men thinking?

--Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
--I just can't figure out their characters.

Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

--Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
--Th-The real hell starts now.


The Hellish Recoome! Keep Me Entertained, Vegeta-chan"   



Awesome... He won the fight in the blink of an eye... Vegeta is ridiculously strong, all right. 
AA Ki! H-He's alive! He's still alive! It can't be! No way! Hi! H-He's barely... taken any damage... at all...! 
That's enough warm-up exercise. 

ReaCoom is just trying to look cool, while we get covered in dust. 
Our cleaning bill is gonna be through the roof. 
Well, shall we get started? ReaCoom Kick!! Ah! Vegeta-san! Good! That's pretty good, Vegeta-chan! You're better than I thought. ReaCoom Elbow!! 
--You got him! 
--Speed ​​Up!! 
Yoo-hoo! You've still got some spunk, huh? Good for you! Hey there, are you all right? You haven't croaked on me yet, have you? 
D-Did that get him?

Ups-a-daisy...

Nice, nice, that's the way.

Same old ReaCoom, huh?

That's for sure. He's got a nasty streak.

Don't you have any more elegant techniques?

If not, it's about time I killed you. Are you ready?

T-That monster! Damn it, I had no idea he was that strong.

He's tossing me around... like I was a little baby...

I-If I don't do something, he's going to kill me!

--Gohan...
--Yes?

I-If Vegeta gets killed, it will be our turn to die next.

I-I don't care what you try, there's no way we can beat them.

I'm pretty sure not even Goku could.

At this point, it's all-or-nothing.
Let's charge him!

R-Right!

Your life is mine!

All right, here comes my big finish!

A-All right, here goes, Gohan.

Vegeta doesn't have enough strength left to dodge ReaCoom's quick attacks.

Right!

ReaCoom...Eraser gun!!

Vegeta-san!

Move! Get out of my way!
Who asked you to do that?!

Y-You fools! if you've got time enough to save me, why didn't you attack ReaCoom, too?!

For crying out loud, your softness makes me sick!

The ground level has been blown away, and the shape of the planet has been changed.

This guy is terrifying.

That sneak attack just now was pretty good.

Taking that shot from above made me close my mouth.

And look at my teeth. I might be just a l-l-little upset about that.

Hey, Butta! Jheese!

Let me have the two little ones, too!

Okay? Huh? Okay?

Geez, what are we gonna do about him?

Okay, fine! Suit yourself!

In return, you have to buy us chocolate parfaits later!

Okay!

There you have it, you little maggots.

Kuririn-san!

Kuririn-san! Kuririn-san!

M-My bones... how can this be...?

O-One kick, and this is what becomes of me...

He's... too strong...

Th-This can't be fair...

And after the Grand Elder took the time to raise my power, too...

I'm no use at all...

Be strong, Kuririn-san! Kuririn-san!

To be honest, we're done for...

We're helpless before them, and if we run, they'd catch us right away.

They've taken the Dragon Balls, too...

Nothing good has come of this...

Rats! Now I've done it!
I accidentally used too much power!

I was going to play around with him a little bit longer! Pity.

I-I'll do as much as I can! Just you watch me!

This should be good.

F-Father...

D-Darn you, I won't lose to you...!

Outstanding, Ginyu-san.

Imagine, you bringing me all seven Dragon Balls as quickly as this.

Indeed, it was worth it to call in the Ginyu Special Corps.

There is nothing that pleases me, Ginyu, greater, than to hear you say that, Freeza-sama.

This means that I can finally obtain eternal life.

What wonderful joy.

If you would like, I will dance the Dance of Joy for you.

The Dance of Joy, for you, Freeza-sama!

P-Perhaps you could do it for me the next time.

I see.

Imagine, my dreams of achieving immortality will now come true!

It is so thrilling, even for me!

At last, it will mean the birth of a perfect, everlasting ruler for the universe.

And now, Dragon Balls, give me, Freeza-sama, eternal life and youth!

W-What is that?

I'm getting a funny feeling...

No doubt about it. In the very near future, the Grand Elder will be set upon by the hand of evil.

Forgive me, earthlings! I have a mission to protect the Grand Elder!

N-Nothing is happening, is it?

Could you have been made immortal already?

No, I do not believe so.

W-Why...?

Here, go ahead and take it.

Even if you get the Dragon Balls together, you all won't be able to have your wish granted anyhow.

A-As I recall, when I took the second Dragon Ball, that is what the Namekian said to me.

I thought it was just sour grapes on his part, but he said "you all." 
That is exactly what he said. 
"You all"!

There must be some code word for these.

A secret code, known only to the Namekians, that will grant wishes!

A password! A place! Or perhaps some way of arranging the Balls!

We will have to ask one of the Namekians!

Are there still any Namekians alive anywhere?

Hmm? I am picking up readings from Vegeta and the others.

It just might be possible that Vegeta and the others know.

In that case, I must prevent my men from killing Vegeta!

Ho? Hmm, have a look at point .

I am reading what appear to be two Namekians.

There is also a reading that is approaching that point.

We never attacked this point.

So there are some survivors, then.

Very well. I will go there at once, and make them tell me how  to get one's wish granted.

That will not be necessary.
I will go ask them directly.

After all, I am more accustomed to dealing with their kind.

Ginyu-san, you stand guard over the Dragon Balls, please.

Yes, sir! As you wish!
Allow me to take care of that!

Be careful!

Now, to get flying!

All right, here goes!

ReaCoom Bomber!!

Whoops, over here!

D-Don't get up... Gohan...

I-I am... my father's...

S-Son Goku's... son...

I won't let you... l won't let you...

Ho, ho! You still have enough strength left to spout that gibberish?

I don't know what planet you're from, but this is a surprise.

You messed with the wrong guy, huh?!

I won't let you beat me!

Hmph, he's moments from kicking the bucket.

He doesn't have any battle power left.

Of course not. His neck has been broken.

Gohan...

Tch, what a pathetic little brat.

H-Here I thought he'd improved somewhat, but...

You guys are all a bunch of disappointing scum.

I don't know why Freeza-sama bothered to summon us, the Ginyu Special Corps.

I guess I'd better finish off all three of you.

What's that?

It's landing.


Son Goku Finally Arrives! Knock the Ginyu Special-Squad Around"   



K-Kakarrot, you bastard, are you finally here?

Gohan...

Here, Gohan. it's a senzu bean. Eat it.

Gohan! Hey, Gohan!

It ain't no use. His neck is broken, and he's barely alive.

All right, it's okay. Daddy will feed it to you.

What? Hey, hey, hey, hey, who are you?

Are you friends of those punks?

I'm just going to force it down, okay?

Oh, can you stand up?

F-Father! You're here?!

Hey! That kid was almost dead!

What did he do?

Are you okay, Gohan?

Father, be careful! That guy is...

Hang on, Gohan.

I've got to give a senzu bean to Kuririn, too.

R-Right...

You really went through the mill, huh, Gohan?

Yes. I was powerless to do anything.

Why has Vegeta taken such tremendous damage?

H-He got beaten up by that pineapple-headed guy, with the incredible strength he has.

Goku...

Kuririn, sorry to keep you waiting.

Here's a senzu bean.

I don't know whether to be happy, or sad...

Sad...?

He recovered, too.

W-What in the world is going on?

Goku, you can tell, can't you, how strong they are?

I may be all better now, thanks to the senzu bean, but we're just gonna get beat up again.

Not even you stand a chance, Goku.

Their strength is a whole other order of magnitude.

Even Vegeta was powerless to--

Oh, yeah, right...

Now that you mention it, why did they attack Vegeta?

Ain't they on the same side?

Yeah, apparently, they used to be on the same side, but...

You don't have to talk. 
Let me probe around for myself.

P-Probe?

Oh, I get it.

I understand now.

Like why you two have so much more power now, and how Bulma is okay.

About the Dragon Balls being taken from you, and about Freeza, and these guys, too.

Y-You're kidding, right?!
How do you know these things?!

Dunno. I just got the feeling that if I did this, I'd know.

Vegeta seems to be the same old nasty character, but whatever the circumstances, he saved your lives, didn't he?

W-When did you gain that ability?

Only one senzu bean left, huh?

Vegeta!

Go ahead and eat that!

Hey, that was the last one, right?! Why...!?

M-My body...!

T-That was stupid!

Are you planning to heal him, and fight them as a foursome?!

That's not going to help!

That ain't what I'm doing.

I want to settle the score with him later, on Earth.

Settle the score later? You mean...

--Yeah.
--H-Hey...

I'm gonna take care of these guys by myself.

T-Take care of them by yourself?!

F-Father...

You're going to take care of us by yourself, you say?

You're one strange dude.

W-What is he thinking?
He hasn't gone mad, has he?

He can't win, no matter what he does.

What's come over you, Father?

Make this at least a little entertaining, all right?

Hey! What's this maggot's battle power?!

He really is a maggot.

He's only around 5,000 !

Aw, that's disappointing.
You're just a big blowhard, are you?

This is strange, all right.
Why is he so unusually calm?

Doesn't he realize his opponent's ability?

That can't be so. But then...

I don't sense the least bit of bloodlust from him.

I-It couldn't be...! That bastard is...?

Hey, now, is something the matter with you?

What can you hope to do with such a puny battle power?

Huh? This guy's crazy, all right.

He's about to get himself killed, and yet he's smiling.

You can't beat me.

I can tell that without even fighting you.

Of all the things you could have said!

Hey, did you hear that?! This maggot just told the biggest whopper!

He really has gone crazy.

He never used to boast like that.

You don't suppose Father doesn't realize his opponent's power, do you?

I-It couldn't be...
No, that would be impossible...

That lower-class warrior, Kakarrot...couldn't possibly become a legendary Super Saiyan!

I can't afford to stand around here anymore and listen to the jests of a half-wit like you.

I'll shut you up forever, in the blink of an eye!

I-It's said that a Super Saiyan appears once in a millennium.

A Super Saiyan, who overcomes barriers that even the most gifted warriors can't conquer. 
I-it can't be...!

That's just a ridiculous bit of folklore.

A-And even if the legend is real, I'm the only one who has the potential to become a Super Saiyan!

Okay... are you ready for this?

Ginyu Special Corps! ReaCoom!

Mach...Punch!!

H-He vanished!

W-What the...?

Huh?

H-Hey, what just happened?

What?!

W-Why, you...!

W-When did you get here?!

Ah! He's all the way over there!

It looks like Vegeta is the only one who followed Goku over there.

Did he see him move just now?

You guys are in league with that bad guy Freeza, right?

If you act now, you can get away without being hurt.

You should get out of here.

W-What?!

You little bastard. You seem pretty secure in your speed, at least.

But no matter how long you fight, you'll never win by running away!

All right, if that's how you want it, I'll reveal my ace-in-the-hole!

It won't matter how fast and nimble you are!

After all, the whole area around me, ReaCoom, is gonna get blown away!

T-This will show us what Kakarrot's real merits are.

I'll send all four of you into the next world with this one!

ReaCoom...Ultra...Fighting...Miracle Attack!!

Sorry about that.

You left yourself wide open, and I couldn't help myself.

Sorry, sorry.

Y-Y-You little punk...

Did Father defeat him?

You've gotta be kidding, right?

I don't care if he did catch him off-guard, he knocked off the guy that Vegeta, you and I couldn't faze, no matter how we attacked him, with just one blow...

W-What's going on here?! ReaCoom's been...

Th-That attack couldn't have been much of anything!

D-Damn it all...

Th-That was no ordinary attack just now. You can't fool my eyes!

I-It was a devastatingly heavy blow.

He has clearly surpassed the Saiyan fighting level.

How the hell did he do it?
What kind of training did he do?

I-Is the legend true? Is he a Super Saiyan?

What will it be, you guys?

Are you gonna go on back to the world you came from?

Or do you want to be clobbered like this guy?

Did you hear that, Butta?
The macho man is dreaming again.

Yeah. Apparently, he has the mistaken idea that he beat ReaCoom based on his ability.

It was just a weird fluke, paired with ReaCoom letting his guard down.

Yeah. Of course it was just a coincidence.

His battle power rating barely changed at all.

W-What's the deal with Goku's self-assurance?

Father...

Hey...

The Ginyu Special Corps' Red Magma...

Jheese!

As well as the Blue Hurricane...

Butta!

So you ain't gonna leave, then?

Here we go!

Yeah!

You keep messing around with us, and--

W-Why, you...!

Whatever you say, but you guys leave yourselves way too open, don't you?

W-W-What did you say?!

--Y...
--You little...!

W-What was that?!

What did he just do?!

A Kiai push...

He sent them both flying with just a Kiai push!

K-Kuririn-san, do you get the feeling that those two aren't as strong as we thought?

They can't lay a hand on Father.

No, that can't be true.

They have the same amount of Ki as that ReaCoom guy, and not even Vegeta could do anything to him.

Maybe it's just that Goku is too strong for them, and it only looks like they're not so tough.

M-Maybe. But Father's Ki is so much smaller than theirs.

W-What's going on? His battle power is unmistakably 5,000.

Kakarrot is no doubt raising his battle power sharply in the brief moment when he attacks.

Probably to avoid consuming any unnecessary energy.

It's such a brief instant that not even the Scouters can pick it up.

H-He has a tremendous battle power.

H-How can he have that much power?!

This is pissing me off!

I will not let that two-bit nothing make a fool out of me!

Hey, Jheese! Let's get him with the Purple Comet Crush!

Purple Comet Crush, huh? That sounds good.

All right, let's do it, Butta!

Yeah!

Purple Comet Crush!!

Sheesh!

What could they all be doing, while leaving a delicate lady all alone?!

That goes for Son-kun, too!

Saying he got behind schedule isn't going to cut it with me!

He's got to come and take me back, as soon as he gets here!

If I stay here too long, my skin will be damaged, and my good looks will be ruined!

Oh, man! What is this?!

Well? What happened?!

Th-That bastard...!

Jheese...

What, Butta?

At this point, you use your Crusher Ball on him.

With his speed, he'll probably dodge it and run away.

What are you going to do?

Isn't that obvious? While he's desperately trying to escape, I'm gonna slam him from the back.

I don't care how fast he is, my speed is the fastest in the universe!

All right.

But why should we have to, against that scum?!

Damn it!

Crusher...

...Ball!!

Now, come to me!

Well?! Why don't you get out of the way?!

He deflected it!

D-Damn you!

Damn it, where did he go?!

Behind you, Butta!

What?!

--Yo.
--W-When did he get behind me?!

Behind me, who boasts the greatest speed in the universe!

Well, maybe you're second greatest now.

H-How is this possible?

Not only did he deflect my Crusher Ball, he got behind Butta!

It's like I'm having a nightmare!

Who are you?!

A Saiyan, raised on Earth... or so I'm told.

Don't you mess with me! How can a Saiyan have that much speed?!

How am I supposed to know?

Must be all of my intense training, right?

But then, you won't be able to beat me with only speed!

Not if you keep zipping around like that!

After you can't run anymore and your movements slow down, that's when you die, you little...!

Damn it! I'm not gonna let a member of the Ginyu Special Corps be mocked by a lightweight like you!

It's all you can do just to dodge me!
I could defeat you at any moment!

I'm not so sure.

What did you do that for?!

What about you?! What were you looking at?!

--Why, you...!
--Why, you...!

L-Look, this is no time for us to fight between ourselves, right?

Y-Yeah...

You want me to show you?

How there's more to me than just speed?

--What...!
--What...!


Star Performer Entry!? Commander Ginyu vs. Son Goku"   





Both this guy and the last guy ain't dead yet.

Hurry up and take them with you, and get off of this planet.

Don't be a fool, Kakarrot!
Finish them! Finish them off!

These guys have been through the wringer!

There ain't no need to kill them for no reason, is there?

H-How can this be?
We're the Ginyu Special Corps!

We are a five-man elite unit, made up of the cream of the crop from all over the universe!

How can someone of his low level...

This is a nightmare!

Getting beaten, and being powerless to stop it! Damn it...!

Ah, he ran away!

That guy is hopeless.
He left his friends behind.

Hey...

A-Are you really Goku?!

Vegeta!

What's wrong with you?

I told you, there ain't no need to finish them off!

Those guys couldn't even move.

Your treacly sentimentality always makes me sick!

Why did you let that one guy get away?!

The way you are now, you could have easily disposed of him!

It would appear that you weren't completely able to become a Super Saiyan.

Super Saiyan?

You may be proud of how overpoweringly strong you've become, but you won't beat Freeza like that!

Not unless you become immortal.

You have absolutely no idea how fearsome Freeza is!

I hate to say so myself, but I think I've gotten pretty strong.

And you still say there ain't no way I can beat Freeza?

That's what I'm saying.

If you plan on fighting him, you'd better be prepared for it.

Freeza's strength is probably far greater than you can imagine!

Y-You've got to be exaggerating a little bit, right?

You saw how incredible Goku is now.

Those guys were helpless before him!

How could anyone beat Goku now?

Then go ahead and fight him.

What's worse, Freeza has gained immortality with the Dragon Balls by now.

There's no way to beat him, by any stretch of the imagination.

We can only hope we don't run into him.

No...

I don't think he's had his wish granted yet.

What? How do you know that?!

If the Dragon Balls here are like those on Earth, then when Shen Long appears, it should get dark, right?

But it's been bright out this whole time.

I don't think it's happened yet.

Sh-Shen Long? What's that?!

Does something come out of the Dragon Balls once they're all together?

Th-That's it! I get it! He doesn't know what the password is!

He thought he could get his wish granted as soon as he collected all seven of them!

Password? Y-You need that?

There's still a chance left for us to get our wish granted!

Oh, yeah!

Right, Gohan?

Hey, Gohan, we still might be able to bring the guys who are dead back to life!

Hooray!

Goku, we've got to get the Dragon Balls back somehow, right?

Shen Long...?

What?!

Ghurd, ReaCoom, and Butta have been done in, you say?

Yes, by someone you wouldn't even believe.

Don't be absurd!

We are the Ginyu Special Corps!

Except for Freeza-sama, there is no one in the world stronger than the Ginyu Special Corps!

That's what I thought, too. But the fact is...

So the disappearance of those three battle power ratings was not the result of a Scouter malfunction, then?

We must contact Freeza-sama!

You've gotta be kidding! How can we tell him anything so disgraceful?!

It's a good thing Freeza-sama isn't here.

I, Commander Ginyu, will personally show you how to fight.

I-If you please.

Hide the Dragon Balls!

If they come up missing, we will incur Freeza-sama's wrath!

Yes, sir!

There's no way anyone will find them now.

All right then, let's go.

I'm going to take my time and show them just how terrifying I am!

Ginyu Special Corps, move out!

It just isn't very striking with only the two of us.

And I had just thought up a new one, too.

I don't know who you are, but you'll pay for this!

Oh, are you going to pay!

I've had it with Dad.
Where does he get off saying that Son-kun should have already arrived on Planet Namek?

Once Son-kun gets here, he's going to come rescue me first.

I wonder if Son-kun really is here already.

It would be nice if we could get the Dragon Balls back somehow.

Vegeta, you know a lot about these guys, right?

Ain't there any way to do that?

I thought you were going to defeat Freeza.

If I can, I'd like to, but first, we've gotta bring the guys you killed on Earth back to life.

Even if you get your worthless wish granted, before too long, Freeza will blow them away, along with the Earth, and what will it matter then?

Forget about that; let me have my wish for immortality granted.

You can't be serious!
If we were to let you do that, it would be no different than if Freeza did, would it?!

There are two battle powers coming this way!

He's deigning to come to us, huh?

Jheese, the one you let get away, is bringing Commander Ginyu back with him.

I don't care how good you are, you're going to have your hands full this time.

Him, huh? He's trouble, all right, Goku.

Hang on, where's Freeza?

He should be at his spaceship, after Ginyu delivered the Dragon Balls to him.

Well, he ain't there now.

I can sense a strong Ki, way off in that direction.

That's probably Freeza.

B-But that direction is...!

O-Oh, no! That's where the Grand Elder is!

Grand Elder?

That's it! Freeza couldn't get his wish granted, so he went to ask a Namekian personally how to do it!

What?! Are you saying he went to find out the password, or whatever?!

By any chance, is he the one who created the Dragon Balls here?

Yeah, the Grand Elder.

This is bad.

O-Once he finds out how to have his wish granted, he's sure to kill the Grand Elder and the others!

He doesn't know that if the Grand Elder dies, the Dragon Balls will be gone!

W-What?!

They're here!

You went and made real fools of us earlier, didn't you?

The commander has come here personally to punish you!

Well, Goku? Can you beat this guy, too?

I won't know until I try.

This guy's power is in a league all its own, after all.

So, that's the guy, huh?

A battle power of roughly 5,000.

That's right. Just 5,000. Strange, isn't it?

You idiot!

The reason you got made fools of is because you only paid attention to his Scouter rating.

I have no doubt that he momentarily raised his battle power significantly.

That's the type of fighter he is.

By my estimation, I'm guessing his battle power is about 60,000 .

-60,000?! But he's a Saiyan!

I've never heard of a Saiyan reaching 60,000!

It's not impossible.
He's probably an ultra-gifted warrior who, like ourselves, came about as the result of some mutation.

This looks like it's going to be a fight more interesting than any I've ever been in.

I never thought that I, Ginyu, would ever have to show off my true power.

I'll keep this guy contained.

You guys use the Dragon Radar, and find the Balls.

They're probably right next to their spaceship.

If I'm able to defeat these guys, I'll be coming right away.

Don't go talking about "ifs"!
You make sure you defeat them!

--Yeah.
--All right, let's go!

We have to be quick, or the Grand Elder will be dead!

There already might not be time!

Just hurry.

Vegeta, you take care of the other one.

You've recovered from being near death, so your power should have gone up sharply.

He's no longer an opponent you can't handle, right?

You know about that, huh?

All right, get going! Be careful!

--We're off!
--Good luck, Goku!

Th-They're getting away!

Let them be. They're small fry.

All right, let's get going ourselves.

Not much choice, is there?

Catch you later, Kakarrot!

Vegeta!

You're wide open!

Ow... Damn that Vegeta...

So, you are even better than I thought.

All the more reason why Vegeta running off on you must hurt.

I have to settle this quickly, or else the hope that we found will all be for nothing.

This is a welcome development.

The way I see it, Kakarrot and Ginyu's powers are about the same.

If I'm lucky, the two of them might just eliminate each other.

If they do, I can't lose.

Once I find out from those runts the password to get my wish granted,

I'll wipe them out immediately.

Then, once I become immortal, it will mean that I have a chance to defeat Freeza in battle.

It's true, you do have impressive speed for a Saiyan.

Ginyu Special Corps! Commander Ginyu!

Ultra Fighting Pose!!

Like this?

Y-You fool! Your legs! Your legs are reversed!

Oh, right.

You know, you guys all have the strangest stances.

W-What did you say?!

C-Can't you see the splendor of my Ultra Fighting Pose?!

Whatever. I ain't got much time.

I hate to ruin your big appearance, but I'm gonna end this with one burst.

Oh, aren't you sure of yourself?

I, Ginyu, have never been spoken to like this.

If you had shown that self-assuredness when we were squaring off earlier, I would have taken you down a peg right away.

The truth is, I'm the same type as you are, and can control my battle power at will.

Th-That's our Commander Ginyu.
He isn't flustered in the least.

Of course not. Even if his battle power really is 60,000.

Commander Ginyu's maximum battle power is still much higher.

Yikes!

Aww... First the spaceship is wrecked, and I can't get back to Earth, then the communicator gets broken.
Nothing is going my way!

All right, it's fixed. That sure did take a lot of time and trouble.

W-What was that just now?

A-All seven of them are together, aren't they?

I'll bet they're all about to summon Shen Long, and have their wish granted without me! All right, then...

But if Vegeta is the one who's gotten the Dragon Balls together...

Again?! What is wrong with this planet?!

I know! Even if it is Vegeta, I can just say "send me back to Earth" before he can do anything!

Oh, that's easy, huh?

With that settled, I'm off to find the Dragon Balls.

Let's go!

He's fast! Does he have more speed than I do?!

C-Crap!

I managed to stop him cold for you!

Damn it...!

Commander! He's all ours now!

Damn... he's got tremendous power...! I can't get loose...

Commander! Break his bones already, and let's knock him out!

I-I've got no choice but to use Kaio-ken at this point...

C-Commander?!

Who asked you for any help, Jheese?!

C-Commander...

The next time you butt in, consider yourself the one who will be losing his life!

Y-Yes, sir.

And as for you...

You're still hiding some of your true power.

Did you really think I wouldn't notice?

You're probably thinking of saving it for a showdown with Freeza-sama, looking forward to a fight you don't get to enjoy very often. 
Enough of your two-bit sham.

All right, you got it.
I'll show you my true power!

That's better.

It's not worth dying if you get killed before you use up all your power.

Take a good look at my power rating, using that device you've got that can tell an opponent's power!

I don't need to use my Scouter.

Your rating will probably only go up to 85,000.

Kaio-ken!!

-85,000...

90,000...95,000...

100,000... 105,000...110,000...

I-impossible!

111,000!

112,000! This can't be!

I-It's still climbing!


Son Goku at Full Power! There's a Secret Plan in the Shaking Ginyu!?"   




-116,000... 117,000...

-118,000...!

-119,000! This can't be!

-120,000!

U-Unbelievable! This is your true power?!

N-No wonder we couldn't beat him.
How can a Saiyan be so strong?

Let me be clear.

This still ain't the sort of power I can put out for short moments.

W-What?!

D-Don't tell me...

Don't tell me you're a...

...S-Super Saiyan?!

That's what Vegeta was saying, too.

But I've got no idea what it means.

A Super Saiyan?
The all-powerful warrior of legend?!

How can that be?!

He's... he's...a Super Saiyan, the one thing that Freeza-sama fears?!

I hate to say it, but you can't beat me.

I want to avoid any unnecessary fighting.

You guys, get off of this planet!

What? Do you seriously mean that?

I mean it.

Especially with you being a warrior who fights fairer than I expected.

I don't want to kill you.

You don't want to kill me?

He says he wants to avoid unnecessary fighting?

Get off of this planet?

A-A Super Saiyan is supposed to be the mightiest warrior in the universe, one who relishes blood and battle.

Then that's it!

You are not a Super Saiyan, are you?

You have not fully become a Super Saiyan!

I see, so you are not a Super Saiyan.

You don't say.

Grand Elder, it's Nail-san!

Why have you returned? I ordered you to help the earthlings, did I not?

I am terribly sorry, but with respect, my ultimate duty is to defend your life, Grand Elder.

But...

Grand Elder, if you die, the Dragon Balls will disappear, too.

If that happens, the earthlings will not have their wish granted.

There it is!

Bulma-san!

We need the Dragon Radar!

Bulma-san!

Geez... Every moment counts, but right when we really need her, she's never around.

Kuririn-san, over here.

That's a jet-bike track.

Where could Bulma-san have gone on a jet-bike?

Let's go after her! We have to get the Radar from her and find the Balls before we run out of time!

Right!

That must be it.

Sure enough, they've finally gotten wind of this place.

They're almost here.

Dende, come here.

Right.

Now go, Dende.

The earthlings need you.
I have drawn out your power, so you should reach them in a short amount of time.

--B-But...
--Hurry and get going.

Very well. Grand Elder, please don't die.

Will I be killed first, or will my time come first?

No matter. I will leave the speck of dust alone.

He is here.

Do you want something?

My name is Freeza, and I have a certain wish that I would like to have granted with the Dragon Balls.

I have gotten all seven of them together, but I just cannot seem to have my wish granted.

And so, I would like you to tell me...

What shall I do to have my wish granted?

I must ask you to leave. I cannot tell that to someone who is evil.

I think it would be better for you to be more amiable.

There is no reason for me not to kill you.

There are two of you here, right?

I can get my answer from either one of you.

Then that's what you should do.

But before we fight, I will tell you this much: The other one, inside the house, is the Grand Elder of the Namekians.

The Dragon Balls were created by the Grand Elder.

Now listen, and get this into your head: If you kill the Grand Elder, the Dragon Balls will disappear, too.

Grand Elder...?

Hmm, indeed.

You appear to be telling the truth.

He is indeed different from the other Namekians.

Grand Elder, I suppose you have no intention of telling me, either.

However, I doubt you will be able to keep it from me once this man is on the verge of dying.

Nail will not be defeated as easily as you think.

He is the strongest warrior-type Namekian on the planet.

He is not like the other Namekians you have killed up to now.

Apparently, you do not wish to tell me, no matter what.

It is in your hands, Nail.
Please buy as much time as you can.

Understood.

Very well. if you are going to be this unkind, I will show you how terrifying I, the greatest warrior in the universe, can be!

As you have probably noticed...the Grand Elder's life is near its end.

If we fight here, and he is caught in the crossfire, it will not serve you, either.

Let's change locations.

I doubt that the battle will become that serious, but very well.

Wherever you like.

Forgive me, Nail.

Please, try to hold out at least until Dende reaches the earthlings.

At this point, the fate of this world is in their hands.

What are you laughing at?

How can I not laugh, with someone as strong as you are here?

So why are you laughing?

Because I, Ginyu, am so glad that I've met someone so much stronger than I am!

--Jheese!
--Y-Yes, sir!

S-So that's it! Commander Ginyu is about to...

Hold on tight to my Scouter, so that you don't drop it.

That's it, all right.

How far are we going?

Enough, already!

There is no need to go any farther than this!

Right.

My, my, there certainly are a lot of people on this planet who want to die. What is a person to do?

This is amazing. Your battle power has risen to 42,000.

I see. You truly do seem to be different from the other Namekians up to now.

You have surprised me. That is an outstanding battle power.

I can see why you would be called a warrior-type.

Enough that I would like you as one of my own.

However, just for your information, as the opponent you are about to fight, shall I first inform you of my battle power?

My battle power......is 530,000.

However, you need not worry.

I do not, of course, plan to fight you with my full power.

What?!

I know. I will fight using only my left arm for you.

That might be somewhat entertaining.

Enough!

That will not do, will it?

And here I stretched out my neck for you, so you would be certain to hit it, and this is the best you have?

Oh, but then, at 42,000.
I suppose that is to be expected.

Oh my, that was quite unmannerly of me.

I will return it to you.

It might be better for you not to strain yourself, might it not?

I do think that it would be best if you told me, before you get killed.

Oh, this is a surprise!

You can regenerate yourself?

However, while you may be back to normal, your plight is the same.

It seems you are unable to regenerate your strength, though.

Your battle power has fallen.

My, my, even after being shown how great a difference there is between you and me, you still wish to continue?

My word, I have absolutely no idea what the people of this world are thinking.

I won't let you...

I won't let you...!

What is this?! What?!

Does this planet have something against me?!

This time I've had it for sure!

Lucky! If I can make it inside that cave...

A little farther...

I-I made it! I'm saved!

H-Huh? Am I saved?

You meanie! You meanie!

I'm done for sure now!

Farewell, everyone!

Ow!

Eh? What? What happened?

No! Stay back! You perv!
You letch! You idiot! You fiend!

--You moron! You sicko!
--B-Bulma-san!

G-Gohan-kun...? Th-Then...

Th-That was mean, Bulma-san.

What are you guys up to?!

No sooner do you show up out of nowhere with Vegeta and take the Dragon Ball, than you head off again somewhere else!

Just what is going on here?!

Do you think you can get away with leaving a delicate young lady all alone in a dangerous place like this?!

Y-Yeah, but we just saved you from those dinosaurs, didn't we?

B-Bulma-san, we need the Dragon Radar!

If we're lucky, we can get our wish granted!

What?! You still haven't gotten our wish granted?!

I saw on the Radar that all seven of them were together, so I figured you had collected them all, and I was on my way over!

And what is this now?!

Good grief. What are you dilly-dallying around for?

D-Dilly-dallying. Right.

Bulma-san, excuse me.

Kuririn-san, I found them!
They're in that direction!

All right, let's go!

Hey! Tell me what's going on!

We're in a hurry now, so we'll tell you later!

Bulma-san, please wait for us back on that island!

Huh?! You've gotta be kidding me!
Do you expect me to walk back?!

What is this! What is this?!

Oh, yeah! Father is here!

Eh? Really?

So, how about it?
Has he gotten even stronger?

Gohan, let's hurry!

Right!

Son-kun, huh?

I never thought he'd grow up to be so dashing.

Yamucha's supposed to be my boyfriend, and all we ever do is fight.

Maybe I missed the boat.

W-What are you...?!

What the...?

Y-You may not be... a Super Saiyan...

...b-but I like... that strong body of yours...

Y-You like it?

S-Sure enough, Commander Ginyu is going to do it.

I-Incredible. Where in that body of his did he get this much power?

H-Here it comes...

Ch-Change!!


Surprise! Goku is Ginyu and Ginyu is Goku?!
  


Why... am I... over there...?!

I've made a switch.

Your body for mine!

Th-That can't be right!

Commander Ginyu...

Your Scouter.

All right, let's go back to the spaceship.

Freeza-sama might be back already.

Yes, sir!


This body is even faster!

I-I can't move...

So this is the reason why he injured himself, is it?

O-Oh, no! The way things are going, I-- I mean, they, and Kuririn and Gohan are gonna run into each other!

R-Rats, not only ain't I familiar with this body, I'm injured, too. I can't fly very well.

What's more, even if I'm lucky enough to get back to Earth, Chichi's probably gonna yell at me again.

What with the face I've got now...

What am I gonna do?

Hmph, looks like Freeza is away, all right.

W-What?!

So this is a 180,000-power body, is it?!

Still, I think my last face was more handsome.

--Huh, Jheese?
--Yes, absolutely, sir!

I-I have to hurry, or Kuririn and Gohan are gonna get killed!

This way...? No, that way.

Ribbit... ribbit, ribbit... ribbit...

Damn it, I can't even keep my balance very well in this body!

Damn you, Freeza. Seeing as how Ginyu stayed behind, the Dragon Balls have to be around here somewhere.

Whatever the case, those earthlings are going to find them using that strange device of theirs.

They will be along shortly.

I guess I'll trade in my battle suit for a newer one now, while I can.

I have to say, Kakarrot uses a most unusual medicine.

Not only does it heal injuries, but it also completely restores one's strength.

Tch, they've only got the older type in my size, huh?

Kuririn-san, over there!

Got it. That's their spaceship, is it?

There you are, earthlings.

It won't do to let them know I'm here.

I'll have to mask my battle power, the way they do.

Let's hurry up and find them.
It doesn't look like anyone's here.

Kuririn-san, wait!

The Dragon Ball readings on the Radar aren't coming from inside the ship, they're slightly away from it.

Where are they, Gohan?

Let's see, over here.

Right here, Kuririn-san. Right here.

Now that you mention it, it looks like something was buried here.

They put them here?

All right, let's dig them up!

Right!

There it is! There it is!

There's one here, too!

All right! Here's one, too!

Wow, it looks like all seven of them are here!

That's where they hid them?!

We've got them! We've got them all!

All right, now call forth this "Shen Long."

I'll dispose of you, and have my wish of eternal youth and life granted!

Hooray!

We worked hard for this, huh?

Yes. Now, Piccolo-san and the others can finally come back to life.

Now, do it! Call it out!

All right, here goes. We came all the way here for this moment.

Let's have a look at the home soil's Shen Long!

Right.

Come forth, Shen Long, and grant us our wish!

The cue was that simple?!

W-What's going on?
Isn't something supposed to happen?

Just what is this "Shen Long"?

H-He didn't come out.

Shen Long didn't come out!

How come Shen Long didn't come whooshing out?!

Maybe the phrasing is a little bit different.

--Th-Then maybe, "Shen Long, come forth!"
--Damn it...

--No, maybe "Grant my wish!
Come forth, Shen Long!"
--What are they doing?!

That's strange...

Kuririn-san, somebody is headed this way!

Hey, I'm sensing two Ki!

Could it be those "Ginyu" guys from earlier?

Th-Then, Father was beaten by him?

Tch, this is going to be a lot of trouble again.

It's an evil Ki! No doubt about it, it's those guys from earlier.

W-What's happened to Goku?

Mask your Ki and hide, Gohan!

Right!

The Dragon Balls have been dug up!

What's the meaning of this?

How did they know where they were buried?

Goku!

It's me! it's me! You sure gave me a start!

"That Ginyu guy," I thought!
"It's that Ginyu guy!"

I didn't realize that you'd defeated him, and gotten his man to join our side.

Are you the one who found these Dragon Balls?

How did you know they were here?

Don't be silly, Goku.

We found them with the Dragon Radar, of course.

Radar, did he say?

Damn, they've got something like that?

So did you get your wish granted?

That's the thing. it didn't work.

Shen Long didn't come out. I wonder why.

Maybe the incantation is different from what it is on Earth.

I see. it didn't work, then?

Goku...? ls there something the matter with you?

How can I put this?
Something feels kind of... off...

Moreover, why are you wearing their Scouter whatchamacallit thing?

You really want to know?

Kuririn-san! That's not my father!

Kuririn-san, run!

There's another one of them, is there?

There wasn't any reading on the Scouter.

Apparently, they can control their battle power down to zero.

W-What did you do that for, Goku?!

I-It's not Father! That is not my father!

Th-That's not Goku? What do you mean?

Any way you look at it, that's...

I-I don't know. But, I can tell.

I've traded bodies with him.

This one is much stronger, after all.

W-What did you say?!

H-He traded bodies?!

That's right.

The Ginyu Special Corps' Red Magma...

Jheese!

And I am... the Ginyu Special Corps' commander...

Ginyu-sama!

Y-You switched bodies with him?!
That's impossible!

Now then, why don't I give it a test drive--the incredible battle power that reaches over 180,000!

S-Stop it, Goku! Y-You're being controlled!

It's hypnosis, or something!

Whether his body has been switched, or he's under hypnosis, it still doesn't change Kakarrot's strength.

Things are getting even worse.

R-Rats, with this unfamiliar body, I ain't able to sense Ki too well.

Unfamiliar body? That's right!

If I ain't used to this body, then he can't be too used to my body, either!

I'm just getting started!

I'm going to raise my power higher and higher!

Are you ready?!

Commander Ginyu!
That punk has followed us here!

What?

I've found you!

I'm impressed you made it this far!

I should have made that wound even worse!

K-Kuririn! Gohan! Listen to me!

That ain't me! He's switched bodies with me!

Y-You mean, it's for real?!

Th-Th-This can't be!

That's Father?!

Yahoo!

Wow! Yum, yum!

I-I couldn't take that!

That's Ginyu! Don't hesitate to beat him up!

There's no way you guys can be beaten by him!

Listen to me! Give that guy a thrashing!

G-Give him a thrashing?

You fool! There's no way they can be beaten by me, huh?

This used to be your body! 
Its battle power is over 180,000!

There's no chance of them beating me!

Just try it, you'll see.

Th-That's my body.
You think you can control its Ki, let alone perform Kaio-ken?

Unless the mind and body are in harmony, you ain't gonna produce all that much power!

Your bluffs aren't going to work against me, Ginyu!

I'll show you what my battle power is now!

--Jheese!
--Yes, sir!

Jheese! How high is my battle power?!

-23,000, sir...

What?! I couldn't hear you!

it's... 23...

23,000, sir!

Well?! Did you hear that?!

It's only 23,000! Only that much!

How come?

H-How come...?

-23,000...?

Only 23,000, you say?

That's my body!

Like I said, your body and spirit have to be in harmony, or you ain't gonna produce all that much power!

Kuririn! Gohan! You can beat him now!

I-Impossible! This is impossible!

It's true! We just might be able to beat him like this!

Let's go, Gohan!

R-Right!

Now, Gohan!

What's the matter, Gohan?!

Father...

Gohan!

What's wrong with you, Gohan?!

S-Sorry. For a moment, it seemed like it really was Father.

I know what you mean.
It feels the same way to me, too.

But that isn't Goku. it's Ginyu. Got it?

Gohan! Kuririn!

All right, I'll get him this time!

Let's go!

Jheese!

What are you waiting for?!
You start fighting, too!

Y-Yes, sir!

Whoa...

You get to face me.

Vegeta...

Damn it!

You think that flimsy attack will work against me?!

W-Why is this?

Th-This body is supposed to be able to generate a power above 180,000!

Didn't you hear what Goku said a moment ago?

You aren't able to use that body very well.

Why don't you surrender now, while you can?

S-Surrender? Me, Ginyu, surrender?

You must be joking!

Damn it!

You've got some nerve, challenging me to battle at your level!

Just keep on blathering all you like.

How did you hide from us?!

There was no hint of a signal from you on my Scouter!

You guys rely on your Scouters too much.

You'll understand that well, once you fight those guys from Earth!

But then, you're going to end up dying here.

Don't be ridiculous!
The Ginyu Special Corps is made up of a collection of the universe's super-elite fighters!

There's no way a simian punk like you can stand up to me!

And yet even as you say so, you're afraid, aren't you?

Afraid of my rejuvenated power?

What?!

Take a good look at me, with that much-beloved Scouter of yours.

Afraid of you, you say?

Me, afraid of the likes of your battle power, Vegeta?

I-Impossible...

Damn it!

It's broken!

Do you really think it's malfunctioning?

W-Why, you...

I've become stronger every time I've returned from the brink of death.

And, after surpassing the limits of the Saiyan race, I've added even more strength.

The truth is, I've just now realized something myself--

The growth of my power is not just due to me being gifted.

Or in other words, I'm quickly getting closer, myself...to becoming a Super Saiyan.

D-Don't give me that crap!

A Super Saiyan is the mightiest of warriors, delighting in blood and battle.

Kakarrot might not be able to become one, since he's not hard-hearted enough, but I'm not like him!

II-Impossible!

S-Spare me...


A Great Turnabout for Goku?! Super Shenlong, Come Out Right Now!"   


Vegeta! You didn't have to take it that far!

You just spout that naive gibberish all you like, Kakarrot.

You'll never be a Super Saiyan for as long as you live.

I'm the only one who's cut out for that!

What?! Did you say Super Saiyan?!

Haven't you taken care of Ginyu yet?

All right, I'll dispose of him.

Move it!

I-Incredible...

Now to finish the job!

W-Why, you...!

Th-That's enough! Don't kill him, Vegeta!

Die!!

I-It can't be...!

Change!!

This is it! I can get back to my old self!

Let me be in time!

W-What?! Move it!

Damn! That bastard!
How dare he... get in the way...?!

Yow-ow-ow-ow...

Looks like I made it back.

W-What was that? What the hell did Kakarrot do just now?!

W-What was that light just now?

D-Did Goku just jump in there to stop Vegeta's attack?

I can sense Father!

Father has... Father has returned to his original body!

--What?!
--Are you sure, Gohan?

S-So then, now, that Ginyu bastard is over there?

D-Damn...

This time, I'll Change with Vegeta for sure!

That body is all mine!

Th-This is bad... if we let him have Vegeta's body now...it's all over...!

Change!!

Ribbit, ribbit...

He's letting himself get injured, like he did with me, before he switches places with Vegeta...

What's the matter? Is it over already?

That's right! it's all over...for you!

Stop, Vegeta!

You fell for it, Vegeta!

Ribbit, ribbit... ribbit...

--That's it!
--Change!!

N-Now what?

Ribbit... ribbit...Ribbit... ribbit, ribbit...ribbit... ribbit, ribbit...

I-I did it...

G-Goku, are you all right?!

Father, shake it off!

Y-You sure roughed up my body good, huh, Vegeta?

Hmph! Never mind you, tell me what the hell happened to Ginyu.

What just ran away from us was a frog...

What's more, that frog-looking thing over there is Ginyu...

What?

Ribbit... ribbit...

Hmm, I don't know what you did, but I'm still going to stomp on you.

Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit, ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!

Leave him alone, Vegeta...

Ginyu ain't able to do nothing now that he's like that...

Tch, okay, fine. I guess I'll let you go.

I have to feel sorry for you, with the life you've got ahead of you.

--Goku!
--Father!

Hey, Goku, don't you even have a single senzu bean left?

N-No... I don't know what to do...

There's nothing stopping me from wiping out you pests now, huh?

What?!

Vegeta... you wouldn't...

I-it's all right... He can't kill us just yet...

He's right. There is the matter of the Dragon Balls, but I'm also going to need your strength, particularly that of Kakarrot, to fight Freeza.

--Come on.
--Where to?

Inside the spaceship. Bring Kakarrot with you.

W-What are you going to do with Goku?

I'm going to treat his injuries.

How are we supposed to believe you?!

Hmph, then suit yourselves.
You can die by the wayside there.

Damn it.

Kuririn-san...

Let's go, Kuririn-san.

Okay.

Make it quick! There's no telling when Freeza will be coming back.

We'll use this to treat Kakarrot and return him to full power.

W-With that...?

Vegeta, what is this?

It's called a Medical Machine.
In short, it's like a healing capsule.

By submerging him in the special fluid in here, he will recover his strength in a short length of time.

Hmm, in this stuff, huh?

After we've defeated Freeza, I'll deal with you guys, nice and easy.

By then, I have no doubt, I will have become a Super Saiyan.

The Medical Machine in this room is an older type, but knowing Kakarrot, he should be completely recovered in not too much time.

Older type?

I busted up the newer one.

H-He's not gonna drown or anything in there, right?

This feels great.

Now then, I think I'll get you guys some battle wear.

It will at least improve your defense a little bit.

Battle wear? You mean like yours?

That won't be good for our image, huh?

Wow, their civilization is a lot more advanced than Earth's, huh?

It sure does look that way.

Strip out of your clothes and put those undershirts on.

Make it quick. Freeza will be coming.

Listen, Gohan, Vegeta even needs our help with this one...which means that this Freeza guy is awfully strong, huh?

That scares me.

Now for your battle jackets.

Luckily, they have some tiny-sized ones the Littians use.

How are we supposed to put these on?

Once we get them over our heads, our arms won't fit through.

Just force them on.

Those are flexible, and if you pull on them, they stretch easily.

When I turned Great Ape back on Earth, mine didn't tear, remember?

What's more, they are impact resistant.

Ah, amazing! You're right!

Are the gloves and boots made of the same material?

Yeah, sure.

Whoa, these are amazingly light!

They feel almost weightless!

It's no fair, you guys wearing something as nice as this.

Huh, Vegeta...?

I'd rather have something like you're wearing, Vegeta.

I mean, the shoulders look easier to move around in.

This is an older style.

They didn't have anything newer in my base size.

Then again, these don't get in the way at all, Kuririn-san.

I can move freely!

By the way, about how long will it take for Goku to heal?

Good question.

Knowing him, he should completely recover in 50 to 60  minutes.

Gohan, I'm going to go to the Grand Elder's place.

It's possible that Freeza is there, but we have to ask the Grand Elder for the words to summon Shen Long, or we're not gonna get anywhere.

I-I'll go, too.

No, I can handle this alone. Wait here for me.

I am only using my left hand, and look at you.

There is no way you can beat me like this.

How about telling me the way to get the Dragon Balls to grant wishes, already?

You keep on expending this wasted effort.

There is no way something like that will work against me.

You must realize that by now, do you not?

I cannot understand why you continue to defy me, when you know that you will lose.

Is it because your friends have been killed?

Or could it be out of simple obstinacy?

Let me make this my final warning.

Tell me how to get the Dragon Balls to grant my wish...or you will die.

E-Even if you were to find out, it won't do you any good.

D-Dende will reach the earthlings...a-any moment now...t-to tell them the very words that you want to know...

W-What?!

Him...?

Why, you...! You were just buying time for him?!

I-Imagine, things turning out this way...

I should have told the earthlings the right words when they were here.

I-I've made Nail go through that terrible ordeal.

P-Please hurry, Dende.

I-It seems my time is drawing near.

I have to tell Kuririn and the others about the password, as fast as I can!

Hey, you!

Keep a close eye on the Dragon Balls.

I'm going to go take a nap inside the spaceship.

Wake me up when he gets back.

A nap?

I haven't had any sleep this whole time.

Freeza could be coming at any time. How can he sleep?

The Ginyu Special Corps' readings are gone!

Are you telling me that all five of them have been beaten?!

W-Whatever the case, something has happened between Vegeta, the earthlings, and the Ginyu Special Corps!

A-And what about the Dragon Balls?!

Curse you! it will be I, Freeza, that has his wish granted!

Not you inferior life forms!

A Ki.

Something is flying toward Goku and the others.

Th-This Ki belongs to...

it's Dende, all right!

Hey!

It's me, it's me! And yes, I am wearing this outfit!

K-Kuririn-san!

--Thank goodness!
--Thank goodness!

It will probably take Kuririn-san about two hours to go to the Grand Elder's place and back.

What do I do if Freeza comes here during that time?

Wow, this really does help.
We've got all the Dragon Balls together, but Shen Long won't come out, so I was headed to see the Grand Elder to ask him what the password was.

I thought you were.

The Grand Elder told me to tell you how to have your wish granted.

Oh, yeah? So, what are we supposed to say?

You have to speak in the Namekian language, or else your wish won't be granted.

Namekian, huh? I should have known.

The Grand Elder isn't very good with others, huh?

He could have told us that when we were there.

He probably never thought that you'd be able to get them all together.

Oh, yeah.

Never mind that, let's hurry.
The Grand Elder's time is drawing near.

What's more, Freeza might be coming any minute.

Oh, yeah, right.

Hmm? Something's coming.

Is it Kuririn-san? But I sense two Ki...

Huh? They've masked their Ki!

It's Kuririn-san, all right!

And the other one is...

...Dende-kun! Hooray!

Fantastic! it's Gohan!

Thank goodness!

That was incredibly fast, huh?
How did you do that?

Oh, Dende was asked by the Grand Elder to come to us.

To tell us how to get the Dragon Balls to grant our wish?

Yes!

By the way, where's Vegeta?

I masked my Ki before I got here, so he wouldn't know we were coming.

I don't think he's noticed.
He said he hadn't had any sleep lately, and went to go to sleep inside the spaceship.

All right, we're in luck!

Now, let's quietly bring the Dragon Balls over here, so that Vegeta doesn't realize what we're doing.

Then, even if he notices that Shen Long has emerged, we'll have bought ourselves a little time.

--Mm-hmm.
--Right.

Yahoo! We did it!

Okay, it's up to you now, Dende.

Right.

Kuririn-san, something is coming this way! A-At incredible speed!

I-It's Freeza!

Quickly, Dende!
Hurry and get our wish granted!

R-Right!

Takkaraputo Poppolunga pupirito paro!

N-Nothing happened.

Hey, Dende, are you sure you didn't goof up the password?

Th-They're glowing!

Th-The sky has gotten dark!

J-Just like the Dragon Balls on Earth!


An Enraged Freeza Approaches! Porunga... Please Grant Our Wish!"   


H-H-He's huge!

And he has a different shape than Earth's Shen Long.

Th-That's Shen... Long...?

He's called "Polunga" here.
It means "God of Dreams."

This is the first time I've seen him, myself.

Oh, it looks like their wishes are about to be granted!

All right!

At last, we'll be brought back to life.

Good for you, Ten-san!

Thou who hast gathered the Dragon Balls, now, speak forth thy wishes.

I shall grant thee any three wishes that are within my capacity.

A-Awesome! He really does grant three wishes!

That's the homeland's Shen Long for you! Nice and generous!

W-What do we do? We have three of them!

Y-Your wishes, quickly!
Freeza or Vegeta could be...

A-Ah, r-right!

First, ask him to bring back to life all of the people on Earth who were killed by the Saiyans.

R-Right, understood!

Bandappulula lutemilar fanpalitsu pumelett hero lunchelo itachikonchipa pontelo lupiche!

I cannot grant that wish.

I am able to bring only one person back to life at a time.

O-Oh, no!

Apparently, they can only bring one of you back to life at a time.

O-One at a time?!

Now then, speak thy wishes.

I shall grant thee any three wishes that are within my capacity.

W-Within his capacity?

H-Hurry! We'll be in real trouble if Vegeta or Freeza finds us!

What do we do? We can only bring back one person per wish!

Th-This is a tough one.
Who exactly should we ask for?

Damn it! For the homeland's Shen Long, that's not very generous.

Kaio, I'm begging you!

You want to speak to Goku's son?
What are you planning, Piccolo?

Hurry it up, I beg you!

A-All right, you got it. Place your hand on my shoulder and speak.

Gohan! Do you hear me?! it's me! Piccolo!

Gohan!

Gohan!!

Answer me, Gohan! it's me, Piccolo!

P-Piccolo?! it couldn't be!

Where are you, Piccolo-san?

I'm speaking directly into your hearts through Kaio.

Don't drop my honorific.
Call me Kaio-sama! Kaio-sama!

I-Into our hearts?

I know that you can have three wishes granted, but you can only have one person brought back to life per wish!

Listen closely! With your first wish, bring me back to life!

--Hold on!
--We won't let you get away with that, Piccolo!

Shut up!

Listen up. Once I'm back to life, Kami will come back to life, too.

Once that happens, the Dragon Balls on Earth will return, and the others here can then be brought back to life, too!

That's right! I didn't think of that!

U-Understood, Piccolo-san!

I get it. So that's the idea.

--Nice thinking.
--Piccolo, you're amazing!

And now, I'll tell you the second wish.

Have me... Once I'm resurrected, have me sent to Planet Namek, where you guys are!

L... I want to fight!

Against that bastard Freeza, who killed those who are my people, there in the land of my birth!

What are you saying, Piccolo?!

I've gained a lot more strength here!

I will defeat him for sure, just watch!

Summon me to that planet! Got it?!

A-All right, Piccolo-san!

I'm counting on you. Do whatever you want with the third wish.

Right! Piccolo-san, once you get here, I'll really be happy!

See here, Piccolo!

Have you forgotten your promise to me?!

You said you would never fight Freeza!

What can I say? I don't remember any such promise.

What did you say?!

Unfortunately, I have a poor memory.

Why, you...!

--Now, now, Kaio-sama...
--Calm down a little bit.

--Let me go! How dare you people do this to me?
--Please, take it nice and easy.

I don't know who this punk is, but I, Piccolo, will defeat him, no matter what!

You guys don't have any idea how fearsome Freeza is!

Now let me go! I can't talk to you like this, you know!

All right!

Let's get those two wishes granted first!

--Right!
--Dende!

Y-Yes?

Ask him to bring the Namekian named Piccolo, who was on Earth, back to life!

P-Piccolo-san, you say? All right!

Piccolo-san is about to come back...

W-What's that?! Something's approaching!

A tremendous battle power!

F-Freeza!

It will take several more minutes before Kakarrot is back in action.

It will be a real pain if Freeza shows up now.

Damn it, I have a bad feeling about this!

What?!

W-What's going on here?! it's night out!

What the...? There's not supposed to be any night on this world!

W-Why is the sky so dark?!

I-Is this...?

I-It couldn't be!

It couldn't be... It couldn't be...

It couldn't be!

Tetorapto potto Piccolo pupimelopa pimoposo partola temolimpe cooli coopasu puyaccliguo wotoku holakusa pelopuppo!

Very well.

I shall grant thy first wish.

Oh, crap! The Dragon Balls are gone!

Damn it! Kakarrot's son is gone, too!

Why, that dirty little brat!

What is that monster?

Is that monster the dragon of the Dragon Balls that they mentioned?!

Damn it! Those dirty brats got the jump on me!

They'll pay for this!!

Th-This is bad. That Freeza bastard is also coming up on them!

There are four life signs.

I've finally found you!
Just you wait, you inferior life forms!

Ah, it vanished!

Good!

I'm alive again! Now, for the next wish!

I'm counting on you, Gohan!

I don't care anymore!
I really don't care anymore!

Hold it! Hold it, hold it!

K-Kami-sama...!

Piccolo, you rascal!
That was some smart thinking.

Popo, thanks for keeping an eye on things here.

Thank goodness! Kami-sama, so happy you come back to life!

Thy first wish is granted.

Now, speak forth thy second wish.

Our second wish is to please warp Piccolo-san, who we just had brought back to life, here to Planet Namek!

R-Right!

Dende, make it fast! Vegeta has found us out!

R-Right! Telmopara accoloru tsuteno lipilo Piccoloru magake tapaccoloru!

That is an easily granted wish.

I shall grant thy second wish.

That miserable fool!

Thy second wish has been granted.

Now, speak forth thy final wish.

It's been granted? But Piccolo isn't here, is he?

Where are you, Piccolo-san?!

Y-You just said to please bring him to this world, so he has to be here somewhere.

Y-You wanted him to come here?

O-Oh, no!

W-What do we do? Use the third wish to bring him here, or...

V-Vegeta!

I knew it... I knew that's what this was!

How dare you?! How dare you pull the rug out from under Vegeta?!

You will pay for this!

You fools! You've wasted the one means by which we can defeat Freeza!

The only way to beat him was to make me immortal!

You filthy pieces of scum!

Wait! We've only had two wishes granted!

There's still one more wish that can be granted!

You idiot! Don't tell him that!

I'm relieved to hear that.

What is that column of light?

The life sign readings are coming from there, too.

N-No way! They can't be using the Dragon Balls to get their wish!

What is thy third wish?

Okay, make me immortal! Do it now!

You little brat!

Don't you understand what I mean by "do it now"?!

Dende!

Hurry it up! Freeza is already on top of us!

I can't breathe!

I-If that wish gets granted...

But we don't have any choice but to do it!

It will take a while longer for Father's injuries to heal.

So this is my homeland...

Planet Namek, huh?

I see. it feels strangely familiar.

Is it the Namekian blood that flows within me that is making me feel like this?

Whoa, this is no time to be caught up in my emotions.

I have to find Gohan and the others.

Damn it, where are they?!

It doesn't look like they're anywhere nearby.

W-What's that?!

I sense a ridiculously huge Ki, far away!

I-Is it that "Freeza" monster?

There are three other Ki near him.
It's Gohan and the others!

All right, just sit tight, Gohan!

Hast thou thy third wish yet? Speak it now.

What are you waiting for?! Tell him, now!

Make me immortal, right this instant!

Do you want to be killed by Freeza?!

K-Kuririn-san! Freeza is almost here!

At this point, it's all-or-nothing!

Dende! Let him have his wish granted!

V-Vegeta may be incredibly evil, but he's still better than Freeza!

I hate to say it, but right now, there's no other way out of this crisis!

U-Understood...

All right. That's better.

Okay, do it now.

R-Right.

--Stop stalling!
--R-Right!

Good! Now Freeza won't be able to kill me!

Even if I can't beat him now, as long as I keep laying into him, I'm sure to defeat him before too long!

P-Papritto...

Here it comes!

The moment when I, Vegeta, will rule the universe, is here!

Papritto...Vegeta capolasuyo...pelnettolu...

W-What's going on?!

W-What happened?!

Why did the dragon disappear, and the sky turn bright again?!

Why did the Dragon Balls turn to stone?!

Th-The Grand Elder has...

--Dende...
--The Grand Elder has...passed away.

Y-You're kidding...

The Grand Elder, the one who created the Dragon Balls, has reached the end of his life.

W-What did you say?! You filthy brat!

What about me?! What about my immortality?!

W-Well...

Why, you...!

If you hadn't circumvented me, we wouldn't be in this situation!

You'll pay for this!

You miserable fools!

Freeza!

Now you have done it. All of you.

You have shattered my dreams of gaining immortality.

I am not reading the Ginyu Special Corps.

Ribbit! Ribbit...! Ribbit...!

Did you people kill them?

I truly must say... you little fools...

Are you ready to pay the price?

I have to say, having the Dragon Balls turn to stone at the last moment...is a shame for Vegeta-san, but even more so for myself.

This is the first time any fool has disrespected me this much.

I had no idea things would turn out like this.

Y-You'll pay for this...!

I swear you'll pay for this, you worms!

I'll kill you, slowly and surely!

Not a single one of you is getting away! Say your prayers!

You've finally shown your true colors, huh?

Go ahead and try it!

If you think I'll be defeated that easily, you're gravely mistaken!

Of all the things you might have said...it seems you've forgotten how terrifying I can be.

Let me remind you.

I-It can't be!

T-To think he'd be this dreadful...!


A Tormenting Super Transformation! Freeza's One Million Fighting Power"   




That huge Ki just got even larger.

Has that Freeza guy finally gone into action?

I sense a faint Ki. I hope that isn't Gohan!

A Namekian, who looks just like me...

He's close to death.

A-Are you the Namekian the earthlings were talking about?

Y-You are... Then their wish was granted. Good.

Ho, you seem to know all about everything, huh?

Then you must also know that I am hurrying to help those kids.

Yeah...

Sorry, but I'll have to leave you here to die.

You surprise me.

I don't know what kind of training you've done, but you've gained an unbelievable level of power.

Which makes it all the more a shame.

If only you had come back here as your original, single self...

What?!

...you could have beaten Freeza.

Hmph, are you saying that if I had merged with Kami, and we had become one again, our power would be greater than even that Freeza bastard?

Th-That's right. I was overwhelmingly beaten by Freeza, but I think I... know Freeza's power pretty well.

Hmph, it doesn't make any difference now.

Besides, I never intend to rejoin with him!

Then...j-join with me.

I am the last...warrior-type Namekian on this world.

What? You?

Y-Yes. Your own power would increase several times over.

I'm flattered by your offer, but I want to be who I am.

I don't want to join your individuality with mine.

Heh... You're a proud one...

Hurry! There's no time!

I am going to die soon. Quickly, place your hand on my body!

D-Don't worry.
Your personality will be your own.

I will be yours. I will be nothing more than a catalyst.

You wouldn't lie to me, right?

If you think I would, then go on ahead and get killed by Freeza.

All right. Very well, I'll try it your way.

But if I don't like it the least little bit, I'll drive you out right away.

That's a fine thing to say, when I'm offering you a wonderful present with the best of intentions.

I'm in a hurry. if you're going to do this, then do it.

Y-You make sure you kill Freeza. Got it?

Hmph, I don't need to hear it from you.

That's what I want, if I can manage it.
For my own sake, as well.

N-No way... How can this be...?

What power!

What unbelievable, amazing power!

I-Is this what it is to merge with someone?!

I can beat him! Whoever my opponent may be, I can't lose!

I have just obtained ultimate power!

Gohan, at this rate, Vegeta will be finished off in no time!

We have to get in there, and go for broke!

Right!

Kuririn-san!

What a Ki... There's no way we can win...

Of course not. Do you think that three mere ants can beat a dinosaur?

Yes, we can.

If we three fight together, we can manage to beat you.

What did you say? You can beat me?

That's right.

Of all the things you might have said...

Freeza, not even you appear to have realized this, but their battle powers are rising quickly.

The little one, in particular, has a hidden power that not even he is aware of.

And I am in the process of becoming the Super Saiyan that you are so afraid of!

I'm surprised that you would tell such a whopper as that.

A Super Saiyan?

You are really pushing my buttons, you bastard!

What?!

I see. So it wasn't complete hogwash.

It's true... If the three of us fight together, we might be able to get through this.

Sure, he's incredibly tough, but our power has increased, too!

I see. After coming here, Vegeta has gained strength beyond his limits.

But then, why is Freeza so unusually calm and composed?

Transform yourself, Freeza.

T-Transform?!

If we're going to do this, why don't you transform right now, and show us your true self?!

Ho, I am impressed that you knew about that.

How did you find out?

That bastard Zarbon let it slip.

W-What are you talking about?!

There are a very small number of weirdos out there in the universe that are able to alter their forms when it becomes necessary.

Whether for the sake of camouflage, or to prevent them from consuming energy unnecessarily in their usual states.

My case is a little different.

It is because I have too much power, and cannot control it myself.

W-What?

Don't let him scare you! He's just bluffing!

He won't change that much.

Are you sure about that?

Very well. if you want to die that badly, I'll show you.

Watch closely, now. This is not something you will see every day.

After all, I had absolutely no need to transform myself when I attacked Planet Vegeta, where the Saiyans lived.

Vegeta-san, your father, the king of Planet Vegeta, was not all that big a deal.

Don't let that fact swell your head!

I had surpassed the king's power when I was just a little kid!

The Saiyans' planet was destroyed by him, was it?

Now, prepare to be stunned!

Ha! What kind of transformation is that?! it's laughable!

Imagine, your transformation consisting of stripping out of that, and making yourself lighter!

Vegeta-san, you disappoint me.

And after all the favor I have shown you, too.

If only you had remained submissive to me, you would not have had to experience this terror.

What?!

You mean you're now just getting to it?!

What?!

Th-This can't be right...!

W-We're gonna die!

I-It's a nightmare!

Watch yourselves.

Now that I'm like this, I won't be as gentle as I was before.

W-What a Ki!

W-What is this?!

The strength of Freeza's Ki just increased many times over!

I-It couldn't be...!

Gohan!

Vegeta, where's all that energy you had a moment ago?

You were pretty free with your words, weren't you?

Well, not that I can blame you.

Not now that I've shown you my overwhelming power.

W-What a monster!

Like I said, watch yourselves.

After all, I have more power than I can handle.

I just might overdo things.

Incidentally, you can be sure my battle power is at least a million.

W-What?!

O-Oh, no...

N-Not even you could be that strong...

Hmph, if you think I'm lying, then allow me to demonstrate.

Dende!

What is this?! What has that bastard Freeza done?!

What is with this planet?!

W-Where's Kuririn-san?!

Where's Kuririn-san?!

Over here!

You're bleeding!

It's no big deal. One of those rock fragments just hit me.

Your swiftness in fleeing is quite impressive. I applaud you.

But then, that one was just my way of offering my regards.

Even a Saiyan is capable of that.

D-Damn it!

The look on your face is pathetic, Vegeta.

Apparently, you never imagined that I would become this strong.

Well now, who shall I show hell to first?

I've decided!

H-He's fast!


Freeza Bares His Fangs! Gohan's Transcendent Power attacks"   




D-Damn it all!

That's what you get for focusing attention on the Namekian brat!

You earthlings are too soft!

Whoops, sorry, sorry.

Sure enough, I have too much power, and was unable to control myself too well.

Kuririn-san!

Ho, to think you still had this much energy left.

G-Go... h-han...

Kicked the bucket, have you?

Kuri--

Kuririn-san!

You think you can save him?

It's no use. He'll be dead soon.

Never mind him, why don't you worry about yourself, instead?

Although, worry all you like...Whether you're a Namekian...or an earthling...or a Saiyan...it doesn't change the fact that you're going to die.

Move... Move...

Move...

Move... Move it!!

What?!

That kid's power is rising like crazy!

How can this be? What tremendous energy!

U-Unbelievable... When that kid freaks out and loses control, he can call up that much power?

D-Don't tell me...h-he's the closest one to becoming a Super Saiyan...?

K-Kuririn-san...

Kuririn-san!

It's all right! He's still alive!

D-Don't die, Kuririn-san!

You don't have time to be worried about him!

Did you think that was all it would take to kill Freeza?

You don't appear to be just an ordinary pipsqueak, huh?

Even I found that to be a bit painful.

But you picked the wrong opponent, didn't you?

Like I said earlier, it doesn't change the fact that you're going to die.

For all your effort, all you've done is make me more angry at you.

D-Damn it...

it looks like our thinking was far too optimistic.

It can't be... The power of his Ki is getting much, much stronger...

I didn't think he could control his battle power!

I will take the pain I received and return it to you, many times over!

Freeza's power just surged.
The way things are going, they'll all be...

You idiot! Get out of there!

Whoa, don't go taking too much damage from just that.

The fun is just starting.

You're just a kid, all right.
Ls that all the power you've got?

You fool! You got overconfident, and let your guard down!

You took that one dead-on.

All right...

Just for good measure, here's another fierce one!

Take this!

No match for you, am I?

You're the one who looks like the fool now, Freeza-san.

Don't be in such a rush, Vegeta.

I'll play with you good and long, once I'm done with the runt.

Our...fates... are sealed...

Now then, how would you like me to deal with you?

--He's gone!
--Over here.

What's the matter? Can't you move?

This is the end.

Die!

Gohan's Ki is growing smaller and smaller...

I'm coming now! Just sit tight, Gohan!

What's the matter?

Vegeta, aren't you going to come save him?

It looks to me like you've gotten weak-kneed, and you can't move.

Well then, you just hold out there for a little while longer.

I'm about to crush the life out of this one.

And then, you can have your turn next.

I don't care if that kid dies, but what the hell am I supposed to do against Freeza's unimaginable power?!

Fa... ther...

Pic... colo... san...

G-Gohan's Ki is dropping fast.

H-He's dying!

Damn it...!

I can't wait until I've completely recovered!

--Now, to finish you!
--Kienzan!!

Wha--?!

H-How can he still be...?

H-He should be seriously wounded at the very least!

H-How?!

Kienzan!!

Kuririn! Kuririn's Ki has returned!

What's going on?!

Wha--?!

If you don't like it, come on over here!

I'll paddle your behind!

W-Why, you...!

Mock me, will you?!

H-He's too much for me to handle.

All I can do is run from him.

Yikes!

All right!

Your death will not be an easy one.

I'll take you apart with my own hands!

Hmph! Fool!

Come on out of there!

Whoa!

I don't know how you're back in action, but how dare you clip the tail of Freeza?!

I'll tear you to pieces, so that you can never come back to life again!

Oh, no...

Damn...

You can never escape from me, no matter what you try.

I will personally rip you limb from limb!

Now, come on out!

--Die!
--Taiyo-ken!!

Thank goodness! You're not dead!

I'll heal you, right away!

Vegeta! Now! Attack him!

S-So that's what the deal is!

What are you doing, Vegeta?!

Terrific! Gohan's been healed, too!

Why did you keep it from me that the Namekian kid had that ability?!

We didn't keep it from you!
We didn't know it, either!

If we'd known, we would have had him heal Goku a long time ago!

You surprised me, Dende! Thanks!

Mm-hmm, good luck!

Huh?

Darn you! You're gonna get it!

W-What the...!?

There's his inherited Saiyan blood for you.

After he recovered, his battle power increased dramatically.

All right, maybe luck has turned to our side just a little bit.

Impossible! That runt is back, too.

He was supposed to be on the verge of death, too!

Now! Blast him!

You don't know when to quit.

Damn!

I'm not giving up! Like heck I'm giving up!

Even if it's hopeless... Even if it's hopeless, we have to do this!

G-Gohan, wait!

Piccolo-san!

Sorry to keep you waiting.

Thank goodness! We've been waiting for you, Piccolo-san!

That's Freeza, is it?

I see. He certainly does seem to be an unbelievable monster.

Look what the cat dragged in.

If it isn't that punk we killed on Earth.

I get it. I was wondering what you wished for with the Dragon Balls.

You went and brought this good-for-nothing scum back to life.

Excuse me for being scum. But remember this: After I've taken care of Freeza, you will be next.

After you've taken care of Freeza, you'll do me?

I didn't think that Namekians were capable of telling jokes.

So there's still a Namekian who survived, is there?

But there's something different about him from the other Namekians.

He doesn't appear to be any slouch.

But even so, he's still no match for me.

Who is that? Who just arrived?

I can't tell. I can't tell whose Ki that is.

Piccolo? No, not him. It couldn't be.

This Ki is far too huge to be Piccolo.

Gohan's Ki is back, too.
I don't understand any of this.

Now then, to clean up this cosmic trash.

I'll take him alone. You guys stay out of this!

I-Is that the one named Piccolo?

He looks just like Nail-san!

Find some shelter somewhere, Dende, or you'll get tangled up in this.

Hurry it up.

H-How does he know my name?

Piccolo-san!

This is crazy. There's no way that even Piccolo can beat that guy.

Everyone has stopped moving.

What in the world is going on?

Who is the one that just showed up, with the gigantic Ki?


The Reborn Piccolo Shows Himself! An Enraged Freeza's Second Transformation"   




"Let me handle him"? He has no idea how terrifying Freeza is.

He'll realize it soon enough.

Piccolo-san isn't the sort of person not to know his opponent's strength.

But Gohan, Piccolo--

Yeah. I'm sure Piccolo-san has a chance of winning.

A chance of winning?

There's no way he can win.

His arrival doesn't change our situation one bit.

But Piccolo-san is...

This Ki belongs to Piccolo.
Piccolo has come back to life.

His Ki is awesome now, not like before.

You seem to be quite sure of yourself.

But that confidence will soon crumble as you beg me for your life.

Stuff it.

Take this!

Incredible! He's fighting Freeza toe-to-toe!

No, he's doing even better...

You're amazing, all right, Piccolo-san!

What the hell happened to him?

Not that much time has passed since he was defeated on Earth!

Looks like we'll get out of this alive, Gohan!

Right!

Beat Freeza! He killed so many of our kind!

What kind of training did Piccolo go through?

Attaway. Hang in there until I get there.

Die!!

Come on out of there, now.
You can do better than just that.

Piccolo-san...

You're pretty good, aren't you?

Being able to get out of that, at that distance, by a hairsbreadth...

Why, you undaunted fool!

Gohan, Piccolo has incredible power, more than I imagined!

This could be promising!

Right. Piccolo-san can take him.

He is your teacher, after all.

Right!

Piccolo-san...

Piccolo-san!

Don't panic.

It will take more than that to kill him.

I'll let you watch now, as I take him apart.

P-Piccolo-san!

The Namekians are now completely wiped out.

--What?!
--Piccolo-san!

Don't go selling me short.

You little worm...

Piccolo's Ki just skyrocketed again.

Incredible...

I have obtained the ultimate power!

Piccolo-san!

Piccolo!

What?!

Why, you...!

He's fast! My speed should outpace his!

K-Kuririn-san...

How can this be? He wasn't fighting in earnest up to now?!

Tch, he was giving us false hope!

Piccolo...

What a beast this Freeza is!

You'll have to forgive me for earlier.

I didn't give you enough credit.

But you can handle yourself better than I imagined, so I decided to show off my power.

That is what I am capable of.

There's no end to his power...
I was going to fight that monster?

Same goes for me. Let's get down to business.

What did you say?

Are you saying you haven't been taking this seriously up to now?

I didn't know that Namekians told tall tales.

You'll find out soon enough.

Th-That's right!

Piccolo has been fighting with that weighted turban and cape all this time?!

I'll show you the wrath of all the Namekians you've killed!

Piccolo's Ki has gotten even stronger.

This is his true strength!

He can beat him! Piccolo-san can beat him!

Piccolo, we're counting on you!

You've removed your heavy gear, and made yourself lighter.

Which would mean that you've improved your speed, huh?

We'll see.

It will take more than this to placate the wrath of the Namekians!

--He got him!
--Gohan!

Kuririn-san!

Now to finish you!

--Is Freeza...?
--Could it be...?

Tch, look there!

As tough as I expected.

You seem to have the wrong idea about my true power.

What?!

Did you think I was fighting for real back there?

You didn't know that I had transformed, did you?

Transformed?

I shall grant you the same feeling of absolute terror that I gave Vegeta and the others.

All right, first, I will fill you with a feeling of utter despair.

Each time I, Freeza, transform, my power greatly increases.

And I have...two more transformations remaining.

Do you understand what that means?

What?!

Impossible!

Gohan, what did he just say?

Freeza said he can transform two more times.

Now then, allow me to show you!

You should be honored!

You are the first ones to ever see this transformation!

Take a good look at the second transformation of Freeza!

Thank you for waiting.

Now then, shall we continue with round ?

Y-You monster!

H-He hasn't changed all that much, has he?

Idiot! Check out his underlying power!

It's nothing like what it was before!

And yet he's regained his composure and collected himself again.

The damage he took from Piccolo-san is gone, too.

Damn it, what is going on out there, really?

That Freeza guy's Ki has gotten stronger again.

I might not be able to beat him now, even fully healed.

What do I do?

You got me.

You seemed to be pretty proud of your speed, huh?

Well now, let us have another look at it.

Damn it! If you've got all the power, I have all the speed!

You can chase me for as long as we live, and not catch me!

I-It can't be!

Well, well, long time no see.
You certainly are here early.

How about we put an end to the fun and games?

D-Damn...

Now you see that your vaunted speed is, unfortunately, of absolutely no use against me, do you not?

It is time for you to give up.

H-He's too fast!

P-Piccolo-san!

He's ridiculously fast! There's no way he can dodge all that!

Piccolo-san...

Piccolo!

Stop it!

Gohan!

Gohan! Damn it...!

--Hold it!
--W-What are you doing, Vegeta?!

You heading off won't do any good!

But unless we do something...

Listen! The way things are going, we'll all be killed by Freeza!

Never mind them, blast me to within an inch of my life!

Do it right now!

I'll have that kid heal me, and after crawling back one more time from the brink of death, I will definitely be able to become a Super Saiyan!


Freeza's Final Transformation! The Ultimate Nightmare Begins!"   



--What?!
--You can just...

...die!!

G-Gohan!

Full power!

Pour it on, Gohan!

Thank you, Piccolo-san.

Go... han...

This is odd.

That little one should not have had that much battle power.

After being close to dying, and recovering, it is as though he is a different person.

So that's it! That little one is a Saiyan!

But whose child is he?
Twenty years ago, all of the Saiyans except for Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz were exterminated.

Whose is he?

He does not take after Vegeta or Nappa.

So he is Raditz' son?
Something about him seems familiar.

H-He may have knocked that one back, but you've gotten stronger, Gohan. I'm quite pleased.

But we've had it now. 
I hit him with everything I had, but it didn't have any effect on Freeza!

Hey, you!

You know about how, when we Saiyans come back from death's doorstep, our strength increases, right?!

Listen to me. You have to blast me half to death, before Freeza performs his last transformation!

Now, hurry up and do it!

It won't work if I'm the one who injures myself.

You have to do it!

I-I don't have the power to nearly kill you...

Don't worry. I will lower my battle power to its minimum, so your power will be plenty.

We're lucky that Namekian kid, who can instantly treat injuries, is here.

Regardless of how much I hate you, I couldn't.

B-Besides, Goku should just about be recovered.

Kakarrot is the lowest class of warrior!

He won't ever get any stronger!

I must eliminate every last bit of Saiyan blood.

I do not believe in any ridiculous legends about Super Saiyans, the mightiest warriors in all of history, but I still do not feel too great about them.

The little one and Vegeta are growing stronger right before my eyes.

All right... it would be an easy matter for me to blast all of you into little pieces as I am now, but before I kill you, I will show you ultimate power, even more terrifying than death!

Ultimate what...?

It will be my treat.

You will be able to experience a horror even worse than hell-- my true form!

There's still time, if you do it now! Hurry and do it!

No-Oh, man...

Damn it!

See if I care!

That's not going to cut it!

Hit me with a stronger Ki!

Can you do that, you thick-headed good-for-nothing?!

Th-That's better...

I-I'm about to become... a Super Saiyan...

W-Why... did Kuririn-san shoot Vegeta?

G-Gohan! Get away from here!

Right!

Are you all right, Piccolo-san?

I-I can't say that I'm fine...

I know! it'll be all right!
I can get your wounds healed!

There's a Namekian named Dende who can heal injuries.

I'll go ask him to come over here.

--Gohan...
--Kuririn-san, where's Dende?

W-What...?

Y-You say you can't heal me...?

Th-That's right!

Y-You were able to heal the others, but you can't heal me...?

You killed a lot of my friends.
I can't heal someone who did that!

Y-You little brat...

Unless you heal me, we'll never defeat Freeza...!

No!

D-Do it now... I-I'm starting to pass out...

I'm... I'm...

I'm...going to go help him!

Damn you...

...b-brat...

When Saiyans like Vegeta recover from being nearly dead, they gain a whole bunch of strength.

You know that, right?

Y-Yes.

That's why he had me blast him on purpose.

He was sure that he could beat Freeza.

Is that right?

--Dende!
--Dende?

Vegeta!

I-Is it true... that you can... heal injuries...?

Y-Yes!

Dende...

So that's it. That's how they did it.

Unbelievable. Do I have this ability?

No. Like Nail-san, you are a Warrior-type.

Never mind that, Dende, I can understand you not wanting to heal Vegeta, but for the time being, we can't do without him.

He's... the same as Freeza!
He's killed a lot of Namekians!

Heal him for me.

I can handle Vegeta.
However, Freeza is too much for me.

W-What was that? Freeza?

He's finished his transformation!

Damn it! I should've held my Ki, and gone off to hide somewhere!

Go ahead and try it! He'll just blow the entire planet of Namek away!

He doesn't have any more use for this world!

W-What kind of ridiculously huge Ki is that?!

A-An out-of-this-world monster is about to appear!

D-Dende, please, heal Vegeta.

Dende...

He's coming into view!

You filthy little brat!

Be grateful I didn't kill you!

Freeza's battle power...

So you've finally shown your true self, have you?

Bring it on, Freeza, and all other comers.

I have just become a Super Saiyan!

That's Freeza's true form?

He's smaller, and more slender.

He doesn't seem to have as much punch.

H-He's a textbook example of not judging someone's ability by their appearance.

He's been cuddly, up to now.

D-Damn it!

And after all the trouble you went through getting your wish granted with the Dragon Balls...

I'm sorry.

I just... don't think I'm going to be able to help you. Damn.

Piccolo-san...

How can that be? Freeza's Ki has gone up again.

Damn it.

"Bang."

W-What?!

D... Dende!!

I-I didn't see it! All I saw was something flash!

Th-That's impossible!

Now, none of you can be revived, right?

D-Dende...

Somebody died. Who was it?

Damn it, I don't know what's going on out there.

Dende has been killed...

Damn it!

H-He watched us being restored by him.

Th-That's why he was first.

D-Darn him...

Ah! He disappeared!

That fool!

W-Where...?

--Over here!
--What?!

When did he...?

I promised you, didn't I?

That I would show you a horror even worse than hell?

However, the Namekian child there was unable to go through it.

That's a shame.

I'll make sure that you experience enough to make up for it.

Damn you!

The petty cries of maggots grate on my nerves Know your place, you inferior life forms When the consummate emperor's wish is granted, The verse of love will be but a chilling elegy

Y-You're not getting away!

Did you get him?!

H-He disappeared again.

Th-That's impossible!

You dumbasses! Behind you!

What?!

That's correct.


The Moment We've Waited For! Son Goku is Revived"   



Get out of the way, dumb-ass!

I-I-I couldn't see him move, or his attack, this time, either...

H-He was able...

Vegeta was able to see it. B-But why?

Have his abilities really gone up that much?

Th-Thank you...for saving me.

Don't get the wrong idea. I didn't save you.

I just thought I would let you see something cool.

S-Something cool?

D-Don't tell me you think you can beat him!

--Oh, yeah.
--Y-You don't mean...

You guys are in my way.
Back away, and watch very closely.

You certainly are sure of yourself, Vegeta.

Or is it that you're so terrified, you've lost your mind?

Go ahead and smirk now, while you still can.

What stands before you...is the thing... you fear most--a Super Saiyan!

--S...
--Super... Saiyan...?

W-What's that? What is a Super Saiyan?

I see you still take jokes too far.

Hmph, in that case, let me show you what a super-elite like me is capable of, now that I have become a true Super Saiyan!

Is that Vegeta's Ki?

He's gone and powered up like crazy.

Whoever you may be, you don't stand a chance against me. 
I am the prince of Saiyans

I am number one

Gohan, let's put our money on Vegeta, and go find some shelter, now!

Higher! I grow stronger.
Th-Though I have to admit, I didn't think his power would shoot up so dramatically.

A warrior race-- such is my blood

You can see it for yourself.

That's why Vegeta had me blast him half to death, and then had Dende revive him.

Get you down! (Get you down!)
Get you down! (Get you down!)

S-So that's what that was about. Sure enough...

I was born to fight

Saiyan blood!!

Beat you down! (Beat you down!)
Beat you down! (Beat you down!)

I am about to become legend

W-What? What happened?

Huh? Neither one of them is any different from before. What the...?

No, you're wrong, Gohan. Sense out Vegeta's Ki.

It may be still, but it's become incredibly huge.

Amazing. To think that his Ki is as massive as this...

Hmm, one would think that you've powered up substantially.

Hmph, stuff it! Be grateful you've lost your Scouter!

If you saw what our battle powers are on your Scouter now, you'd probably run away from here in tears.

That's because my power is now even greater than yours.

Brace yourself, Freeza.
This time, you're through!

What's the matter? Are you too scared to say anything?

Huh, Freeza-san?

Okay, okay. I get it, I get it.

If that's how badly you want it, then I will have a look at the power of "history's mightiest warrior," the Super Saiyan.

Don't you mock me!

I see you!

Kakarrot isn't going to get a shot at you!

A-Awesome!

F-Freeza is being completely swept away by him!

N-No...

V-Vegeta... i-is gonna get killed...

Piccolo-san...

What's the matter, Freeza?!
You won't beat me by just running away!

What?! Th-This can't be! W-Where is he?!

Th-There's no way that I, a Super Saiyan, could have lost sight of him!

What?!

I-Impossible...

I go no-nonsense on speed for a second, and you can't keep up, huh?

And you call yourself a Super Saiyan?

I-It can't be...

Vegeta has all of that power and speed, and yet he's being toyed with.

He's an out-of-this-world monster, all right!

Vegeta, to be honest, with that level of attack and speed, you won't be able to beat me.

I seem to remember you saying you were a Super Saiyan, right?

If that's what you are, is this really the best "history's mightiest" can do?

Don't make me laugh.

The Super Saiyan really is no more than a silly legend, after all.

I-Is this really the best I can do?

Have I not become a Super Saiyan?

Or is Freeza a foe that not even a Super Saiyan can beat?

Ridiculous! That can't be possible!

There's no way that can be possible!

There's absolutely no way that can be possible!

Hmph. Fool...

I see you!

I see you, Freeza!

That miserable Vegeta...!

What?!

I-I am...

I am... a Super Saiyan!

You burn in hell, Freeza!

Are you trying to blow the whole planet away, Vegeta?!

W-What?!

Perhaps it's about time.

I can't have you getting too full of yourself, after all.

H-He knocked that back at him, with just a kick...?

Vegeta had to have launched that attack at full power.

He's incredible... He's beyond incredible...

This time, I will be coming at you.

Nice and easy.

Vegeta...

For the first time ever, Vegeta is genuinely trembling...out of pure fear and utter frustration.

He's even shedding tears, out of terror and despair.

This is a first for him.

Here I come. Are you ready?

Vegeta has... Vegeta has already lost the will to fight.

Don't!

He's done for.

Vegeta, I can't have you give up after just that.

You have to endure even more.

Horror beyond hell, that is.

Well? Do you regret your foolishness at all yet?

You lowlife, good-for-nothing-but-fighting Saiyan?

I thought you, at least, were different, so I took you under my wing.

But sure enough, you were no different from the other fools, were you?!

If only you hadn't turned on me, you wouldn't have to go through this.

If you'd like to help him out, feel free at any time.


Defeat Freeza, Son Goku! The Proud Vegeta's Tears"   




Piccolo-san...

Okay, they're right nearby.

Forgive me, I'm coming now!
I think I can pull this off!

This is no fun. it looks like all the fight has gone out of you.

This may be a bit soon, but maybe I should finish you off.

Aha...

Sure enough, that huge Ki belongs to you, Piccolo.

S-Son...

Way to go. The Dragon Balls brought you here, did they?

Father...

Are you okay now?

Yeah. Thanks to you guys, I've recovered from all that damage.

You fought well, Gohan.
Let me handle it from here.

What?!

L-Let you handle it?

Are you planning to take on that monster by yourself?!

Yeah.

Father...

I-Is that really you, Goku?

Your Ki feels different than it has up until now.

S-Son!

Th-That's Son? His Ki is unbelievably strong.

There's no comparison to when he was back on Earth!

You're Freeza, are you?

You're a lot punier than I thought you'd be.

There's still some of you trash left, is there?

Vegeta promised me a fight.
Don't come between us.

I've seen this guy somewhere before...

K-Kakarrot... you're...

Kakarrot? That's a Saiyan name.

Him!

Freeza, get out here! I'm gonna make you pay!

--It's Freeza-sama!
--Freeza-sama!

Everything changes now.

Him! It was definitely him!

The fate of Planet Vegeta...my own fate...Kakarrot's fate...as well as...your fate!

This is the end!

He looks just like the Saiyan who resisted me right to the end, when I destroyed Planet Vegeta.

W-What?!

K-Ka... kar... rot...

Kakarrot!!

I won't leave a single Saiyan alive.

You fool. You could just take it easy and tremble before me.

Yeah, maybe.

H-He's not the same Kakarrot as before...

He's finally overcome his limitations...

Which means...!

Are you ready?

Yep.

W-What?! Did Goku just do something?!

No way!

Not even I could see that clearly.

His speed was even greater than Freeza's!

Get out of the way, Goku!

Yikes! Get out of the way, Goku!

You're an insolent one.

It can't be. You deflected them all?

And with only one hand?

Freeza, you'd better fight him like you mean it...

H-He is the very thing you fear most...

A Super Saiyan...!

That's right... The legendary, mightiest warrior in the universe...

A Super Saiyan...

Freeza, you're finished now... You asked for it...!

V-Vegeta!

You know, Vegeta, that I don't like unfunny jokes.

Vegeta!

Hey! Vegeta couldn't even move anymore!

There was no need for you to finish him off!

That's what he gets for endlessly carrying on about that nonsensical legend of the Super Saiyan.

I hate people who won't shut up.

K-Kakarrot...

Vegeta!

A-Are you still preaching that "mercy" crap...?

Do you mean you're not a Super Saiyan...?

Wait!

You dumb-ass! Harden your heart!

If you had put aside your mercy...you'd have surely become a Super Saiyan...

There ain't no way that I could act as cold-blooded as you do.

And for that matter, I don't know anything about any "Super Saiyan."

A S-Super Saiyan is...

Don't speak anymore!
You're just gonna hasten your death!

Fire!

Magnificent! Just look at them, Zarbon-san, Dodoria-san!

Look at how beautiful the fireworks are!

L-Listen to me closely, Kakarrot...

I've run through his heart and everything. He's a stubborn one.

Are you going to keep talking?

Th-The reason why Planet Vegeta, the world where you and I were both born, is gone...i-is not because it collided with a giant meteor...Freeza destroyed it...We Saiyans served as his hands and feet, and did as we were ordered to...but he killed everyone but us...including your parents, and my father, the king...it was because, as the Saiyans started to grow in strength, Freeza was afraid that a Super Saiyan would be born...

Hmph, give me a break.

Vegeta...

I-I beg you... defeat... defeat Freeza...P-Please... by Saiyan hands... d-defeat...

Vegeta...

He finally kicked the bucket, huh?

Well then, shall we reconvene this horror show?

For you to cry...For you to beg of me...must have been pretty demeaning for you.

What's the situation on Planet Namek?

Vegeta is dead.

W-What?!

V-Vegeta? You mean he...?

Yes. He was killed by Freeza, like it was nothing.

After serving as Freeza's right-hand man, and serving as he was ordered to, he ultimately turned on him, and was killed.

Such a pitiful story.

Was it his pride as a Saiyan?

I-Is that how fearsome this Freeza is?

They have touched that which is untouchable, that's what they touched.

D-Damn. Not even Goku could stand up to an opponent like that.

So then, what about Goku?

He is planning to fight him.
He apparently intends to defeat Freeza.

Goku!

--Goku...
--Goku...

I get it.

You ain't upset that your Saiyan pals were killed.

You were beside yourself over having to be his puppet, weren't you?

I may have hated you...but you had the pride of a Saiyan.

I'm going to share part of that pride.

I am a Saiyan, raised on Earth.

And for all of the Saiyans that you've killed...as well as... for all of the Namekians here...I'm gonna take you down!

What nonsense.


Son Goku vs. Freeza! The Curtain Opens on the Super Decisive Battle!"   




W-What kind of power does he have inside him?

Son, when did you get that much power?

Guys, we're getting out of here! We're in the way!

Gohan! Hurry!

Gohan!

Father!

Father, don't die! Let Freeza have it!

So that's it. He ain't able to read Ki.

Father!

Gohan!

A-Awesome... it's beyond awesome...

I'm alive again!

B-But I've still had it. I can't walk anymore.

I'm going to die here.

Without going back to Earth, not being watched over by anyone, alone and forsaken.

It's true, the fairest flowers soonest fade.

I've had enough! I'm not about to die here, surrounded by frogs!

Whoo! Hot! Hot! Hot!

Ooh, that stings!

Now, then...

He's not that bad.

W-What's happened?

Don't tell me Son is...!

Nah, he's putting up a good fight.

Those Saiyans are an unusual bunch.

Or maybe it's just Goku.
His strength knows no bounds.

It's as though he's a different person than when he trained here.

He's a hard one to figure out, isn't he?

What a piece of work.

You're an insolent one!

W-What...?

Hot! Hot! Hot!

An eruption? Why is that happening now?

Father!

Son...

End of the line!

Hey, don't go around wrecking other people's planets so much!

What if it gets broken?!

You appear to be a lot stronger than I thought. I'm a bit surprised.

Imagine, someone in this world who is better than Commander Ginyu.

But you're no match for me.

Maybe not. But you can never tell.

Oh, yes I can.

Right back at you!

He escaped from my psyche blast!

Ee-yow! Ooh, that hurt!

Hurry up on out of there.

There's no way you'd give in after just that.

That bastard has incredible speed.

Okay now, what am I gonna do?

He doesn't seem able to sense an opponent's location using their Ki, the way we can.

He consistently seeks me out with his eyes.

All right, guess I'll make use of that.

What's the matter?

Goku still hasn't come up!

It's all right! Father's Ki hasn't dropped one bit!

It's kinda been a while since I've done this.

I wonder how old man Turtle Hermit is doing.

Ka... me... ha... me...Ha!!

All right, hold it there, hold it there...

What's the matter? Not ready yet?

And here I was going to give you your final gift.

All right, here goes!

Off you go!

Here he comes!

That's not him!

One more!

Over here!

No!

A resounding success.

Huh?

That didn't hurt you at all?

I didn't expect you to be this good.

You're the first person, not including my father, to get me covered in dust.

This might be the first time in my life that I've been this excited.

How shall I deal with you?

Aw, man... l thought that would have hurt you at least a little.

I think I'll terrorize you for a bit.

Damn it, is this telekinesis?!

shoot!

All right, if that's how you want it...!

You've got a lot of nerve.

What is that?!

I-It's a whole island!
The whole island is floating!

Son!

This time, you're finished.

--I caught you!
--Oh, crap!

I can't... move...

it serves you right.

When I miss, you're through.

Gotta get out of this somehow...

The game is just about over.
I've grown tired of it.

W-What?

This one just might kill you.

Gohan!

Piccolo-san!

Goku...

Father...

What a monster. Freeza is just playing with him.

He's got enough power to blow up this world, if he wanted to.

And yet, judging by the fact that we're still alive...

He really is just playing around, huh?

What a beast!

Piccolo-san, what about Father?

Don't waste your time worrying about him.

That son of a gun isn't serious yet, either.

Look over there.

Father!

Whew... that was kind of a close one.

I'll have to watch out for that attack.

I told you before, don't go wrecking other people's planets so much!

How did Goku manage to...?

He escaped from his paralysis at super speed

at the instant of the explosion.

He did something that amazing?
In that one instant?

The both of them are monsters, damn it!

You're a persistent one. Even I'm starting to get a little ticked off.

So am I.

I think I've had enough warming up, so I'm going to start fighting like I mean it.

So am I.


A Physical war That Exceeds All Limits! Goku and Freeza and Ginyu, Again?!" 
  



Which are you better at--fighting in the air, or on the ground?

Which one? On the ground, I guess.

You mean you're going to fight me on the ground, where I'm better at it?

You're pretty accommodating.

Or are you just that confident?

Despite how it may appear, I am quite nice.

I know. I'll let you have one other freebie I've been saving.

Another freebie?

I won't use my hands against you.

How's that?

Your hands, huh? That's pretty generous.

Now then, is it okay if I lead off?

Of course.

Whatever you like.

My, my, what's the matter?
Are you already done with your attack?

Your moves are too slow.

This one will be to the left, now.

Now the right!

Right! Left! Right!

And a final one to the right!

You're strong. For as big as you talk, you also have amazing speed.

It's funny. Here I am, fighting someone this incredibly strong, but for some reason, I'm getting really excited.

If you're not gonna make a move, then I'll bring it to you again!

What?!

Damn it, I can't get loose!

I thought you weren't going to use your hands.

Your freebie time has expired.

Then maybe this is a freebie from me, but I should warn you...

Warn me?

You place too much confidence in your strength.

As a result, you leave yourself wide open.



You are strong. indeed, you might even say phenomenal.

Why, thanks.

But I'm growing tired of this fight.

I think it's about time to settle this.

First, though, let me ask you one final thing:

What do you say? Would you like to work under me?

I'd hate to eliminate all that power you've got.

After all, you'd be able to serve me even better than Commander Ginyu.

You've gotta be kidding me.

Did you really think I would accept your offer?

I figured you would say that.

Saiyans are stubborn to the point of foolishness, after all.

Well then, there is but one avenue left for you.

Only death.

I don't know. it ain't gonna be that easy.

Such self-assuredness. However, I can tell, despite you telling me you're fighting all-out, you're still keeping quite a bit of your power back.

Hmm? You caught me.

With that in mind, the way I figure it...if I go to about 50 percent, or in
other words, half of my max power, I will be able to reduce you to cosmic dust.

That's a bit of an exaggeration.
You're bluffing too hard.

It's been fun.

It really has been a long time since I've had this much of a workout.

What's going on? The two of them are just staring at each other.

They're both looking for the right time to attack.

I have to admit, the force of their incredible Ki is almost smothering.

Father can beat him, right?

There's no way to know that.

Their power is far beyond our comprehension now.

That's the truth.



I hate to do this. I really do.

If you were to come work for me, every day, wonderful things would await you.

Both King Vegeta, and Vegeta...as well as that lower-class warrior Burdock...

They were all so terribly obstinate.

And it cost them their lives.



If I go to about 50 percent, or in other words, half of my max power, I will be able to reduce you to cosmic dust.

H-He ain't bluffing...

What speed! I couldn't see a thing.

Again, I didn't see Freeza's movements.

Is that how wide a gap there is between our powers?

Like I said, if I go to about half of my max power, I can reduce you to cosmic dust.

D-Damn...

Your speed is too slow! I see right through you!

Glad you could make it!

Damn it...

What's the matter?
Never mind half of my max power, I'm not even using a third of it.

That's what you get!

Looks like you're finally starting to get winded.

But then, the fact that you're not dead yet is amazing all by itself.

It's impossible. He's too strong.

W-Who knew he was this powerful?

Kaio-sama, Goku is wearing those heavy clothes, right?

No.

What he's wearing now is just sturdy. it's not weighted.

I-Is that right?

No-Oh, no. Then, Goku is...

Goku...

There's nothing to worry about, Chaozu.

Goku is going to win this fight.

Have you forgotten about the Kaio-ken technique?

The way Goku is now, he should be able to withstand ten times his own maximum power.

That's right!

Yeah!

Hooray! Hooray!

No...

Unfortunately, he's using that times-ten Kaio-ken already.

Oh, no!

Th-This is bad. There's too much difference in their powers.

Father...

--Bulma-san...?
--That's Freeza-sama for you, against a Saiyan.

What splendor!

W-Who are you?!

I am...

Watch out, Piccolo!


It's a 20-Fold Kaioken! A Kamehameha with Everything on the Line"   



This is too easy. Feel free to
be a little more entertaining.

W-What a technique...!

Like I told you, if I wanted to, I could destroy this entire planet.

I'm the one who brought about the destruction of Planet Vegeta.

H-He's got me...

I-I can't beat him.

What did he do?

H-He cut right through the planet itself.

A-And I have to wonder, does Goku have any ideas?

It looks like this is starting to become a one-sided beatdown.

He doesn't have any ideas.

Freeza's abilities are just far greater than Goku or any of us ever thought.

W-What?

Th-Then Goku is...

Son is already using his times-ten Kaio-ken, the most that he can manage, and he's still being beaten, Kaio-sama?

What's worse, Freeza says that he isn't even using half of his full strength.

No-Oh, no!

Th-This is why I told him that no matter what happened, he was not to take any action against Freeza.

He's lost...

You need not worry.

I won't kill you instantly, with a move such as that one.

Doing so wouldn't be enough to placate my anger.

I-I guess I'll just have to raise my Kaio-ken up to times-twenty somehow.

My body may not be able to handle it...b-but if, as he says, he's only using 50 percent of his power, there really ain't nothing else I can do.

It's too late for you to agonize about this.

You're the one who started it, after all.

You're going to be my plaything until I grow tired of you.

What's the matter?
You've got to fight back a little.

It's no fun without a challenge.

Hey, now, the fun is just getting started.

It's not yet time to go to bed.

I can't take it anymore!

Well? How does it feel to be a fish?

Kuririn...!

Chichi!

Goku-sa...!

Goku-sa!

Father!

Gohan!

Father!

W-What?!

Father!

G-Goku!

For Gohan, Chichi, and everyone on Earth and Planet Namek's futures, there ain't no way I'm gonna lose!

Whether what he's saying about only using 50 percent of his power is just a bluff, or whether it ain't, the only thing I can do is risk a times-twenty Kaio-ken!

Ka...me...ha...me...Ha!!

D-Damn it all...

How can that be? it didn't even hurt him that much.

H-He wasn't bluffing this time, either.

He really was only using half of his power.

U-Unbelievable.

G-Goku's Kamehame-Ha just now had tremendous power!

So why?

Why did Freeza take hardly any damage?

Father's Ki has dropped significantly!

How can there be someone like that guy in our world?

He's utterly beaten. 
Kaio was right.

No matter what happened, we should not have acted against Freeza.

Th-That was a close one.

H-How does that lowlife Saiyan have that kind of incredible power?

He's the first one to push my body this far.

Miserable Saiyan!

That one...hurt.

It hurt!

F-Father!

You monkey!

What happened to all that energy you had a moment ago?

You little worm. Have you gone and used up all of your power?

If that's all you've got, then maybe I should end this.

I really have lost a lot of power.

Sure enough, that times-twenty Kaio-ken was too much for me.

As I thought, you Saiyans are inferior life forms, whose only use is in battle.

Every last one of you is a fool.

I was right to have killed you off.

I've... had it...

Kakarrot, I thought you were better than this.

Is that all the power you have?
Where is your Saiyan pride?!

I-I ain't a Saiyan!

Are you still saying that?
You are a model Saiyan!

Vegeta, none of that matters now.

You and I ain't...

Vegeta, are you...?

You are a Saiyan.

Within you flows the blood of the warrior Saiyan race.

Don't you feel upset?
The world where you and I were born, Planet Vegeta, was destroyed by Freeza over there!
Does it not wound your pride as a Saiyan that he's done nothing but mow us down? Including your father, Burdock, as well as... ...my old man, King Vegeta... Kakarrot, you are the last Saiyan left.
He intends to kill every last Saiyan.
It's because he fears the birth of the mightiest warrior in all the universe, the legendary Super Saiyan! 
I wanted to be the one to defeat him, if I could...but he killed me like I was a rag doll.
You can't know how frustrating that is.
But I beg you, Kakarrot...
You make sure to defeat Freeza, by your own hand!

I don't understand what you're thinking.

That's something that I hate!

No, I will not let you die easily.

I still want to enjoy this some more.

Vegeta...

I grew up on Earth, so I don't know nothing about Saiyans.

But I do understand your frustration.

More of that nonsense?

I can't lose. I can't lose, not to Freeza!

Don't you mess with me!


This Is the Last Trump Card! Goku's Extra-Large Genki Dama"   




What?!

Why, you!

That was a bit of a close shave.

It looks like you've gotten some of your fight back, huh?

But then, Saiyans are, after all, inferior life forms.

I am able to read what your next attack will be.

You will never be able to beat me.

It looks like you're just about through.

You'll be wanting to die soon, right?

I will put you out of your misery now.

I can't take this anymore! I'm... I'm going in!

W-Wait!

Why? Father is going to be killed!

Goku is about to do something.

But what? What can he do with the little power he has left?

What? What are you planning to do?

Ah! A Genki Dama!

What? Genki Dama?

Y-Yeah.

The Genki Dama is an ace-in-the-hole move that Kaio-sama taught him.

He has the grasses, the animals, ourselves, and even the microbes on this planet each share a little bit of their life's genki energy with him.

He then forms an energy ball with it, and attacks.

What?

Damn, Kaio didn't mention that to us, huh?

But will it work against Freeza?

Th-There are a lot fewer living things on this world than on Earth.

What choice does he have?
Goku knows that much!

But is there anything else he can do?
He's got no other choice!

Th-This Genki Dama was the last thing I wanted to use.
It will probably have too much force, and there's no guarantee it won't smash up the planet itself.

But I have to defeat Freeza now, while I still can, or the universe itself will get wrecked.

I don't know whether or not this will work, but I have to do it.

What is that?

You've thought up some more of your nonsense, huh?

As worn-out as you are, what do you think you can do?

G-Goku...

Is he really gonna be able to defeat Freeza with a Genki Dama?

What is this? What is he doing?

Why is he just standing there, and not making any moves?

Grasses, trees, and animals of Planet Namek, as well as all living creatures throughout the universe, please share some of your genki energy with me, just a little bit from each of you.

I ain't gonna defeat Freeza with just the energy from this planet.

Those of you on the many worlds near Planet Namek, share just a little bit of your genki energy with me.

W-What is this? What am I picking up?

Th-That's...

Th-The Genki Dama!

I-It can't be...!

Th-That huge thing is...

I-It's huge! Look at how huge it is!

Is it really all that big?

The one on Earth was about this size.

This one has to be meters in diameter.

There's no way he could get a Genki Dama that big, no matter what he did, from the energy of this planet alone.

Goku is collecting Ki from nearby planets, as well.

It doesn't look like Freeza has realized it yet.

Why doesn't he attack him right away?

He has to collect more Ki, and make it even bigger, or it won't defeat Freeza. I'm sure that's what Goku is thinking.

Father! Hurry, hurry!

Planets of the universe, give me your genki energy!

What's the matter? This is some kind of tactic, right?

Take your shot.

Or are you just raising your hands to surrender?

The time it takes to collect enough Ki is this thing's greatest weakness.

Please, don't let him find out for a little longer.

Enough, already. How long do you intend to stay like that?

Good question. How long, indeed?

W-Why, you...!

--He knows!
--No, not yet.

Well, then? Weren't you going to launch some sort of attack?

Are you trying to make a fool of me?

A little more...

Well? What are you trying to do?

--G-Goku!
--Father!

Gohan! Kuririn! Give me whatever Ki you've got left!

Give it to me, right now!

Right!

Come on, don't be in such a hurry.

Don't you mock me, you simian bastard!

Don't think about anything else! Focus your Ki!

Right!

I don't understand what you Saiyans are thinking.

I never have, either.

You're an unpleasant bunch.

I have no intention of carrying on this dull fight any longer.

I'm going to finish you, along with the whole planet.

The other little runt will die, as well.

Then, every last Saiyan will be gone from this world.

The legendary Super Saiyan was nothing more than a fantasy after all, huh?

That's not the sun. What is it?

Th-The jig is up...

W-What is that?!

Don't tell me that's a mass of energy!

Th-That's what you were...

All right, that's good. Keep a little bit of Ki for yourselves.

Looks like he's finally discovered it.

Gohan, Kuririn, you guys stay here!

No matter what happens, don't jump in!

H-He was making that thing in mid-air?

Where did he find that much remaining power?

It's all over now. Even if I use the Genki Dama now, he'll dodge it.

On top of that, it ain't big enough to defeat Freeza anyway!

Damn it!

Hmph, you were planning to blindside me with that?

You're so pathetic.

Your last-ditch strategy ended up being futile, huh?

Damn it!

Too bad.

Damn it!

Away with you.

Piccolo!

Goku, hurry up and finish your Genki Dama thing!

Thanks!

Make it quick, Goku!
With my power as it is now, that sneak attack was the most that I could manage!

You got it!

Is that rotten Namekian still lingering around?!

I'm surrounded by pesky flies, sneaking around all over the place!

Aren't you done yet, Son Goku?!
Isn't your Genki Dama finished?!

That Freeza punk has completely lost his cool now!

N-Not yet... This is still going to take some time...

Throw it! Throw it, already!

I-I can't... Just a little longer...

You don't know when to die, and you're still hanging around here.

Let me show you the power of someone who doesn't know when to die!

Piccolo-san...

Piccolo might be thinking of giving his life.

He probably used up most of his energy on that sneak attack earlier.

Now he's going to risk his own life to buy enough time for Goku to finish the Genki Dama.

Piccolo-san!

Wait, Gohan!

Goku, please hurry.

Hmph, that won't work.

Don't you get it? That won't work!

It appears that you want to die first.

Goku! Hurry... Hurry up and finish the Genki Dama!

Piccolo...

G-Gohan...

Aren't you done yet, Goku?!

I'm almost at the end of my rope!

Just a little longer.

Just a little longer until I can defeat Freeza.

As you wish, I will kill you first.


Awaken Warrior of Legend... Super Saiyan, Son Goku!"   




Those guys... They stretched what little Ki they had left to attack.

Imagine, those bugs still remaining in their spot...

They are indeed skilled at trying my patience.

This ends now!

I'll scrap you, along with this whole planet!

Goku, aren't you done yet?!

All right! it's finished!

Goku! Do it!

Father!

No-Oh, no!

Get down!

Th-This is nothing...!

Th-This is nothing...

Oh? What's this?

H-He got him! Freeza has... Freeza has been beaten by Goku!

He actually defeated Freeza!

--He did it! He did it! He finally defeated him!
--He did it!

--Mm-hmm, Goku has won!
--He did it, he did it!

Kuririn-san!

Hey, you're all right, huh?

Y-Yes.

It's completely different now, huh?

Where's Father? Where's Piccolo-san?

They were right next to it.

You don't think they were engulfed in it, too, do you?

No way.

I can't sense their Ki.

That's just because we don't have enough strength to concentrate.

Piccolo was there with him.
There's no way they would die, right?

K-Kuririn-san, over there...

Piccolo-san!

--It's Goku!
--Father! He's alive!

Yay! They made it! They made it!

Just like I said, right?

Damn, we barely have any Ki left, so we can't fly very fast.

Father!

Piccolo-san!

Piccolo!

Father!

Gohan...

Hey, Goku, are you okay?

Piccolo-san...

Yeah.

Gohan, you must have been worried.

That was incredible!
That Genki Dama sure was huge, huh?

Well, sure. it had the hopes of the universe packed in it.

I thought the two of you were dead.

Hmph, you think we'd be snuffed out that easily?

Now we can return to Earth with our heads held high.

I didn't think I'd ever get my chance...

--At what?
--Eh? Oh...

Th-There's something I've always wanted to do--get married.

Ready to go home?

The spaceship I came in will get us back to Earth in five days.

Wow, I'll be able to see Mother!

Yay! I'll be able to see everyone!

Hooray, hooray!

Yowch...

I completely forgot about Bulma-san!

Ribbit... ribbit... ribbit... ribbit-ribbit...

Don't scare me like that.

I thought that Freeza had popped up again, you know.

I-In one sense, Bulma-san is even more terrifying than Freeza.

Ow! Don't make me laugh too much! I'm aching all over.

I have to say, Namek has been through an awful spot.

But now, the Grand Elder, and everyone else who died, will be able to rest in peace.

How do you know about the Grand Elder?

What, Kuririn?

I-I-It can't be...

Freeza!

He took that massive Genki Dama dead-on, and yet he's still alive...

N-No way...

Goku!

Piccolo!

P-Piccolo-san...

P-P-Piccolo-san!!

W-What? it can't be...

Kaio-sama, something wrong?

Piccolo... Piccolo has been done in.

But Freeza is supposed to be dead now!

Freeza is a terrifying beast.

Worse than I imagined.

P-Piccolo...! Hey, Piccolo...!

Freeza...

Even I thought that one could have killed me.

I, Freeza, very nearly died!

Get out of here, Kuririn and Gohan.

There's a spaceship right near where I first arrived.

Take Bulma and get away from this planet, right now.

Gohan, snap out of it!

I'm going to fight! I'm going to avenge Piccolo-san!

Get going, now! You're in my way!
Do you want us all to die?!

--G-Goku...
--Father...

Do you think I'm just going to excuse you?

I'm not going to let a single one of you leave here alive.

Kuririn-san!

Kuririn!

Kuririn-san!

Don't do it, Freeza!

Goku!!

N-Now what?

It's Kuririn.

Perhaps I'll do the kid next.

Y-You'll pay for that...

How dare you...? How dare you...?!

What?!

Gohan, take Piccolo and go back to Earth, right now.

He's still clinging to life.

Beat it, now, while I still have some shred of reason!

Right!
