1
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,957
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,600
How fastidious you've become, Wormtail.

3
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,051
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:50,166
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,285
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,306
I only meant...

7
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,907
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:57,992 --> 00:03:00,611
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:04,236
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,081
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:09,293
I will not disappoint you, my Lord.

12
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:10,868
Good.

13
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:14,088
First, gather our old comrades.

14
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:15,874
Send them a sign.

15
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:31,937
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

16
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:35,046
...is standing just outside the door.

17
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:40,944
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

18
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,228
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

19
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,184
Harry.

20
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:51,634
Harry!

21
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,563
Are you all right?

22
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:57,778
Hermione. Bad dream.

23
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,985
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

24
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,958
Last night.

25
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,113
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

26
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:06,599
Bloody hell.

27
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,513
Honestly, get dressed.

28
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:10,958
And don't go back to sleep.

29
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,533
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

30
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,686
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

31
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,728
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

32
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:28,848
Keep up!

33
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,431
Arthur!

34
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,035
It's about time, son.

35
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,213
Sorry, Amos.

36
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,973
Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start.

37
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:43,103
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.

38
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:45,586
Works with me at the Ministry.

39
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,210
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

40
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:50,246
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:51,793
This way.

42
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,503
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

43
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,493
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

44
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:01,871
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

45
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,707
Yes, it's just over there.

46
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,082
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

47
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:13,023
We don't want to be late.

48
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:16,678
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

49
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,531
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

50
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,230
- That isn't just any manky old boot, mate.
- It's a Portkey.

51
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,245
Time to go!

52
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:26,318
What's a Portkey?

53
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,095
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

54
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,260
...three!

55
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,108
Let go, kids!

56
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,487
- What?
- Let go!

57
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,608
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

58
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:05,089
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

59
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,564
Go on, look at that!

60
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:17,155
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

61
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:23,408
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

62
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,114
Look!

63
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,475
Come on! Keep up, girls!

64
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:37,408
Blimey!

65
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:39,776
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

66
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,265
- See you at the match.
- See you.

67
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,103
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

68
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:44,391
See you later, Cedric.

69
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:50,618
Home sweet home.

70
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:54,098
What?

71
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:04,113
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

72
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:05,613
- All to the bath.
- Look.

73
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:07,840
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

74
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:11,368
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

75
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:13,871
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

76
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:15,734
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

77
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,142
I love magic.

78
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:38,170
Get your Quidditch World Cup programs here!

79
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,297
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

80
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:43,537
Well, put it this way,

81
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,106
If it rains...

82
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,432
...you'll be the first to know.

83
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:50,914
Father and I are in the minister's box...

84
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,693
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

85
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:56,525
Don't boast, Draco.

86
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,139
There's no need with these people.

87
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,253
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

88
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,749
While you can.

89
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:22,022
Come on up. Take your seats.

90
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,208
I told you these seats would
be worth waiting for.

91
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,815
Come on!

92
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,650
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

93
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,428
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

94
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:41,383
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

95
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,414
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

96
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:56,263
Who's that?

97
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,564
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

98
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:05,653
Krum! Krum! Krum!

99
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:10,318
Krum! Krum! Krum!

100
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:11,613
Krum!

101
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,156
Yes!

102
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:23,099
Good evening!

103
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:26,202
As Minister for Magic...

104
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:29,963
...it gives me great pleasure...

105
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:33,995
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

106
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:39,470
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

107
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,470
Let the match...

108
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:43,959
...begin!

109
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,653
Krum! Krum! Krum!

110
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,163
There's no one like Krum.

111
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,941
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

112
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:06,470
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

113
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,338
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

114
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:11,605
He's an artist.

115
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,960
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

116
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:15,803
<i>Viktor, I love you</i>

117
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:17,518
<i>Viktor, I do</i>

118
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:21,181
<i>When we're apart
My heart beats only for you</i>

119
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,509
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

120
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:25,190
Stop! Stop it!

121
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:27,553
It's not the Irish.

122
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,978
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

123
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,841
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

124
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,718
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

125
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:42,048
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

126
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:43,623
Go!

127
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:45,581
Harry!

128
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:03,313
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

129
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,866
Harry! Harry!

130
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:55,863
<i>Morsmordre!</i>

131
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:24,093
Harry!

132
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:28,813
- Where are you?
- Harry!

133
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,909
We've been looking for you for ages!

134
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:35,329
Thought we lost you, mate.

135
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:37,812
What is that?

136
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,126
Stupefy!

137
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:45,142
Stop!

138
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:46,881
That's my son!

139
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:51,363
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

140
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:52,748
Which of you conjured it?

141
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,849
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

142
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,173
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

143
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:59,468
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

144
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:00,855
What crime?

145
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,355
It's the Dark Mark, Harry.
It's his mark.

146
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,191
What, Voldemort?

147
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:10,188
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

148
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,695
- His followers?
- Yeah.

149
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:13,751
Death Eaters.

150
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:18,463
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

151
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:20,767
There!

152
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:23,060
All of you, this way!

153
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:25,544
A man, Harry?

154
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:27,228
Who?

155
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,191
I don't know.

156
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,022
I didn't see his face.

157
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,085
Anything from the trolley?

158
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,211
Anything from the trolley?

159
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,858
Anything from the trolley, dears?

160
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,297
Packet of Drooble's...

161
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,433
...and a Licorice Wand.

162
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,748
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

163
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,082
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

164
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,941
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

165
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:25,018
Thank you.

166
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,705
Anything sweet for you, dear?

167
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:30,749
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

168
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,518
Anything from the trolley?

169
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:35,776
This is horrible.

170
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,305
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

171
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:41,778
Wasn't there any security or...?

172
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:43,878
Loads, according to Dad.

173
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,032
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

174
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:53,852
It's hurting again, isn't it?
Your scar.

175
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:55,942
I'm fine.

176
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:00,834
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

177
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,901
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

178
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,500
Hedwig. There we go.

179
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,028
Clear the runway!

180
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:06,298
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

181
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:35,350
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

182
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,878
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

183
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,985
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

184
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:46,603
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

185
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:48,836
Yes, what is it?

186
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,288
What is it?

187
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,749
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

188
00:16:56,533 --> 00:17:02,300
So, Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event.

189
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:04,713
The Triwizard Tournament.

190
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:07,303
- Now, for those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

191
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:10,586
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

192
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,987
...for a series of magical contests.

193
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:16,452
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

194
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,441
Now let me be clear.

195
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,498
If chosen, you stand alone.

196
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,747
And trust me when I say...

197
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:26,405
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

198
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:28,749
But more of that later.

199
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,607
For now, please join me in welcoming...

200
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:35,677
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

201
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,021
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

202
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:53,700
Bloody hell.

203
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:04,183
Blimey. That's one big woman.

204
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:28,217
And now our friends from the north.

205
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:31,152
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

206
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:34,027
...and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.

207
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:58,588
Oh, it's Krum!

208
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,308
Blimey, it's him!

209
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:01,795
Viktor Krum!

210
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,923
Albus.

211
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:13,986
Igor.

212
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,154
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

213
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,686
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

214
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,684
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

215
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:40,731
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

216
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:43,743
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

217
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,954
You idiot!

218
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,348
Your attention, please!

219
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,783
I'd like to say a few words.

220
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:06,708
Eternal glory.

221
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:11,135
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

222
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,426
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

223
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:20,135
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

224
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:21,608
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

225
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:25,332
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

226
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,488
To explain all this...

227
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,969
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

228
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,711
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

229
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:50,434
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

230
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,501
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

231
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,211
Dark-wizard catcher.

232
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,477
Half the cells in Azkaban
are filled thanks to him.

233
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:01,442
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

234
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,107
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

235
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:19,007
Thank you.

236
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:27,303
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

237
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:29,977
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

238
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:39,366
After due consideration...

239
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:42,709
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

240
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:45,825
...no student under the age of 17...

241
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,565
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

242
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,222
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

243
00:21:52,307 --> 00:21:54,992
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

244
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:58,495
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

245
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,250
The Goblet of Fire.

246
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:24,388
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

247
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,354
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

248
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:30,903
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

249
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:33,964
Do not do so lightly.

250
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:37,411
If chosen, there's no turning back.

251
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:42,442
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

252
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:10,681
Alastor Moody.

253
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,691
Ex-Auror...

254
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:18,356
...Ministry malcontent...

255
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,958
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

256
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:25,733
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

257
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:27,646
Any questions?

258
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,343
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

259
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:36,598
...I believe in a practical approach.

260
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:42,577
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

261
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:45,970
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

262
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:47,751
Because they are unforgivable.

263
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:49,608
The use of any one of them will...

264
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:53,674
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

265
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,750
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

266
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,017
I say different!

267
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:00,421
You need to know what you're up against!

268
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,075
You need to be prepared.

269
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:04,761
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

270
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:07,122
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

271
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:08,409
No way.

272
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:10,564
The old codger can see out
the back of his head.

273
00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:13,423
And hear across classrooms!

274
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:18,640
So, which curse shall we see first?

275
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,475
- Weasley!
- Yes?

276
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:21,610
Stand.

277
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:26,422
Give us a curse.

278
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:31,198
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

279
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:33,107
The Imperius Curse.

280
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:36,442
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

281
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:39,465
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

282
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:42,493
Perhaps this will show you why.

283
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,110
Hello.

284
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:54,546
Lovely little beauty.

285
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,123
<i>Engorgio.</i>

286
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:01,519
<i>Imperio!</i>

287
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:08,119
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

288
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,073
If she bites...

289
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:18,226
...she's lethal.

290
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:22,557
What are you laughing at?

291
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:25,262
Get off!

292
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:29,475
Talented, isn't she?

293
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,529
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

294
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,474
Drown herself?

295
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,937
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

296
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:55,266
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

297
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,648
...under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.

298
00:25:58,733 --> 00:25:59,827
But here's the rub...

299
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,521
How do we sort out the liars?

300
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:07,405
Another, another.

301
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:10,050
Up, up. Come on.

302
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:11,726
Longbottom, is it?

303
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:13,799
Up.

304
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:20,303
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

305
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:23,459
There's the...

306
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,134
The Cruciatus Curse.

307
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:28,583
Correct, correct. Come, come.

308
00:26:29,313 --> 00:26:30,556
Particularly nasty.

309
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,469
The torture curse.

310
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:38,548
<i>Crucio!</i>

311
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:52,661
Stop it!

312
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:55,031
Can't you see it's bothering him?
Stop it!

313
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:16,481
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

314
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:20,264
No?

315
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:23,087
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

316
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:29,205
The Killing Curse.

317
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:32,966
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

318
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:35,832
...and he's sitting in this room.

319
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:09,597
Brilliant, isn't he?

320
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:11,873
Completely demented, of course,

321
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,333
and terrifying to be in
the same room with...

322
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:15,957
...but he's really been there, you know?

323
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,605
He's looked evil in the eye.

324
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,172
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

325
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,090
To perform them in a classroom...

326
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:24,126
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

327
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:28,594
Neville?

328
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:30,122
Son?

329
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:32,022
You all right?

330
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,335
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

331
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:53,173
We're gonna be late!

332
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,991
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

333
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:27,405
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

334
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,233
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

335
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:31,824
Yeah, rather you than me.

336
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,484
Yes!

337
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,354
Thank you, thank you.

338
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,551
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

339
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,503
It's not going to work.

340
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,013
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

341
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,623
You see this? This is an Age Line.

342
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:52,487
Dumbledore drew it himself.

343
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:53,698
So?

344
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:59,677
So, a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

345
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:02,779
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

346
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:06,471
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

347
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,617
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

348
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,153
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

349
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:18,323
- Yes!
- Yes!

350
00:30:19,044 --> 00:30:20,038
Yeah!

351
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:22,745
Yes!

352
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,741
Ready?

353
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:30,297
- Yes!
- Yes!

354
00:30:39,343 --> 00:30:40,786
- You said!
- You said!

355
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:45,725
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?
- I'll tear your ears off!

356
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,320
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

357
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:51,293
Fight! Fight! Fight!

358
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:56,790
We're "old school," right?

359
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,407
Yeah, but you look older!

360
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:32,818
Sit down. Please.

361
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,999
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

362
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:41,525
The champion selection.

363
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:16,395
The Durmstrang champion is Viktor Krum.

364
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:35,003
The champion for Beauxbatons...

365
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,251
...is Fleur Delacour.

366
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:50,733
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

367
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,580
Excellent!

368
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:05,231
We now have our three champions.

369
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:09,641
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

370
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:13,605
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

371
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:16,192
...this vessel of victory...

372
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:18,399
...the Triwizard Cup!

373
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:51,117
Harry Potter.

374
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:55,054
Harry Potter?

375
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,304
No. No.

376
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:03,988
Harry Potter!

377
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:05,128
Go on, Harry.

378
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:07,163
Harry, for goodness sake.

379
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:40,526
He's a cheat!

380
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:43,070
He's not even 17 yet!

381
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:14,994
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

382
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,150
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- Quiet! I can't think!

383
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:20,299
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

384
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,637
- Harry.
- I protest!

385
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,677
Harry, did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

386
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:26,088
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

387
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:27,513
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

388
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:30,087
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

389
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,224
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

390
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:35,815
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

391
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,973
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.

392
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,108
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

393
00:35:41,193 --> 00:35:44,473
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

394
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:47,864
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff

395
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:49,357
perhaps you remember.

396
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:51,183
This doesn't help, Alastor.

397
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:54,258
Leave this to you, Barty.

398
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:57,793
The rules are absolute.

399
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:03,070
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

400
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,746
Mr. Potter has no choice.

401
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:10,499
He is, as of tonight...

402
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,845
...a Triwizard champion.

403
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,850
This can't go on, Albus.

404
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:47,175
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

405
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:49,083
What do you suggest, Minerva?

406
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:52,145
Put an end to it.

407
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,267
Don't let Potter compete.

408
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:57,764
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

409
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,253
Well, the devil with Barty and his rules.

410
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:03,673
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

411
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:07,828
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

412
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:11,973
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

413
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:15,266
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

414
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,617
...let them unfold.

415
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:20,994
What...? Do nothing?

416
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,047
Offer him up as bait?

417
00:37:24,012 --> 00:37:26,899
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

418
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:28,793
I agree.

419
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,513
With Severus.

420
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:33,509
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

421
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:36,489
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

422
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,997
He must be anxious enough as it is...

423
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:42,177
...knowing what lies ahead.

424
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,729
Then again, we all are.

425
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:02,134
How did you do it?

426
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,620
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

427
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:09,002
Might've let
your best friend know, though.

428
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,067
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

429
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:14,980
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

430
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:16,372
Okay?

431
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,592
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

432
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,619
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

433
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:29,322
I didn't put my name in that cup.

434
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:32,249
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

435
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:37,602
Look, I don't know
what happened tonight...

436
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:39,087
...and I don't know why.

437
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,018
It just did.

438
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:42,814
Okay?

439
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:53,400
Piss off.

440
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:11,153
What a charismatic quartet.

441
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:13,845
Hello.

442
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:17,524
I'm Rita Skeeter.

443
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:20,572
I write for the "Daily Prophet".

444
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,028
But of course you know that, don't you?

445
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,743
It's you we don't know.

446
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,294
You're the juicy news.

447
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:32,815
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

448
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:36,757
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

449
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:40,052
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

450
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:42,801
In short, what makes a champion tick?

451
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,557
"Me, Myself and I" want to know.

452
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:47,500
Not to mention my rabid readers.

453
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:50,210
So, who's feeling up to sharing?

454
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:56,372
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

455
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,905
This is cozy.

456
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,623
It's a broom cupboard.

457
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,854
You should feel right at home, then.

458
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,921
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

459
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:19,649
No.

460
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:22,081
So, tell me, Harry.

461
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,843
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

462
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:27,496
I'm 14. Sorry.

463
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:30,643
About to compete
against three students...

464
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,040
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

465
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:36,853
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

466
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,746
...in your dizziest daydreams.

467
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:41,089
Concerned?

468
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,846
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

469
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,298
Just ignore the quill.

470
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,953
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

471
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:53,023
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

472
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,618
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

473
00:40:56,703 --> 00:40:59,987
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

474
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:01,794
No, I didn't enter.

475
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,048
Of course you didn't.

476
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:07,664
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

477
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:11,178
Scratch that last.

478
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:14,662
Speaking of your parents,
were they alive...

479
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,483
...how do you think they'd feel?

480
00:41:16,568 --> 00:41:17,416
Proud?

481
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,563
Or concerned...

482
00:41:18,648 --> 00:41:22,204
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

483
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,499
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

484
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,397
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

485
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,968
<i>Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.</i>

486
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,241
<i>Ever since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...</i>

487
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,119
<i>...and she's too easily recognized.</i>

488
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,511
<i>We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.</i>

489
00:42:14,913 --> 00:42:19,055
<i>Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.</i>

490
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,614
<i>And make sure you're alone.</i>

491
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:22,113
<i>Sirius.</i>

492
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:24,147
<i>P. S.</i>

493
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,882
<i>The bird bites.</i>

494
00:42:36,683 --> 00:42:37,717
Sirius?

495
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:57,173
<i>Harry Potter, age 12...</i>

496
00:42:57,258 --> 00:43:00,043
<i>...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.</i>

497
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:02,493
<i>His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...</i>

498
00:43:02,578 --> 00:43:04,047
<i>...and choking back tears...</i>

499
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:22,532
Sirius. How...?

500
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:25,505
I don't have much time, Harry,
so let me get straight to it.

501
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,285
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

502
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,308
No!

503
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:31,903
I had to ask.

504
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:34,716
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.

505
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,915
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

506
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,287
But who was the third man in the room?

507
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,075
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

508
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,917
No.

509
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:49,133
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

510
00:43:49,218 --> 00:43:50,518
And what was that?

511
00:43:52,628 --> 00:43:53,797
He wanted...

512
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:55,530
...me.

513
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,261
I don't know why.

514
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:00,298
But he was gonna use this man
to get to me.

515
00:44:02,594 --> 00:44:04,517
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

516
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:06,322
Yes.

517
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:07,980
It's just a dream.

518
00:44:09,262 --> 00:44:10,285
Look, Harry.

519
00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:14,071
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

520
00:44:14,156 --> 00:44:15,557
...these are not just coincidences.

521
00:44:15,642 --> 00:44:17,892
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

522
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:19,573
What are you saying?

523
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,697
I'm saying the devils
are inside the walls.

524
00:44:22,782 --> 00:44:24,143
Igor Karkaroff?

525
00:44:24,232 --> 00:44:25,366
He was a Death Eater.

526
00:44:25,648 --> 00:44:28,878
And no one, no one stops
being a Death Eater.

527
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:31,478
Then there's Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.

528
00:44:31,563 --> 00:44:33,862
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

529
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,990
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

530
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:43,276
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet, Harry...

531
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,187
...but whoever did is no friend to you.

532
00:44:45,272 --> 00:44:47,669
People die in this tournament.

533
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:50,834
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

534
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:57,109
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

535
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,512
- Who were you talking to?
- What?

536
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:05,036
- Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

537
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:06,814
Maybe you're imagining things.

538
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:08,873
Wouldn't be the first time.

539
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,525
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

540
00:45:39,243 --> 00:45:40,236
Amazing.

541
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,969
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

542
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:48,062
Right, sorry.

543
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,218
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

544
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:55,112
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

545
00:45:57,412 --> 00:45:58,929
It's already been through enough people.

546
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:01,101
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

547
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:05,025
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

548
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,625
What do you want me to say again?

549
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:08,313
Go.

550
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:15,846
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

551
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:20,148
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

552
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:22,189
Is that right? Well...

553
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:23,752
What?

554
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:30,955
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

555
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:37,378
Dean was told by Parvati that...

556
00:46:39,098 --> 00:46:40,768
Please don't ask me to say it again.

557
00:46:41,553 --> 00:46:43,030
Hagrid's looking for you.

558
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:46,040
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

559
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,264
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

560
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:02,148
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

561
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:03,399
You'll see soon enough.

562
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,472
Now pay attention, this is important.

563
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:08,957
What's with the flower?

564
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:12,125
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

565
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,362
As a matter of fact, I have.

566
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,377
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

567
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:28,045
Hagrid?

568
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,667
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

569
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:41,755
<i>Bonsoir</i>, Olympe.

570
00:47:42,414 --> 00:47:43,692
Oh, Hagrid.

571
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:46,093
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.

572
00:47:46,704 --> 00:47:50,003
I thought perhaps you had forgotten me.

573
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,710
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

574
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,321
What is it you wanted to show me?

575
00:47:57,003 --> 00:47:59,667
When we spoke earlier, you sounded so...

576
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:01,851
...exhilarated.

577
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:04,800
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

578
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:17,309
Can we get closer?

579
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:26,627
Dragons?

580
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:28,863
That's the first task?

581
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:31,284
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

582
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,016
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

583
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,736
Oh, crikey!

584
00:48:38,228 --> 00:48:40,692
Although, I have to admit...

585
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:43,288
...that Horntail is a right nasty
piece of work.

586
00:48:43,994 --> 00:48:46,399
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

587
00:48:48,213 --> 00:48:50,300
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

588
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,454
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

589
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:55,513
Didn't Ron tell you that?

590
00:48:57,473 --> 00:48:58,467
No, he didn't.

591
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:00,792
He didn't tell me a thing.

592
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:13,994
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

593
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,519
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

594
00:49:18,604 --> 00:49:21,090
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

595
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,633
Like the badge?

596
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,037
Excuse me.

597
00:49:30,644 --> 00:49:31,690
Harry.

598
00:49:32,897 --> 00:49:34,817
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

599
00:49:34,902 --> 00:49:35,858
Can I have a word?

600
00:49:37,393 --> 00:49:39,877
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

601
00:49:39,962 --> 00:49:42,038
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

602
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:47,210
Dragons. That's the first task.

603
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:50,303
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

604
00:49:50,983 --> 00:49:52,359
Are you serious?

605
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:57,061
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

606
00:49:57,146 --> 00:49:59,274
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

607
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,879
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

608
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,258
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

609
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:05,889
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

610
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:09,376
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

611
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:11,588
It just happens a fair bit.

612
00:50:11,673 --> 00:50:14,099
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

613
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:16,628
You're a right foul git, you know that?

614
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:18,549
- You think so?
- I know so.

615
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:20,427
Anything else?

616
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,510
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

617
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,724
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

618
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:33,008
My father and I have a bet, you see.

619
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:36,202
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

620
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,603
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

621
00:50:42,688 --> 00:50:45,764
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

622
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:49,989
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

623
00:50:51,696 --> 00:50:53,666
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

624
00:50:56,343 --> 00:50:58,520
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

625
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:03,248
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

626
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,013
- Professor Moody!
- ...back-shooting...

627
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,475
What are you doing?

628
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,153
Teaching.

629
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,741
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

630
00:51:19,348 --> 00:51:20,631
Stand still! Stand still!

631
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,218
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

632
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:36,318
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

633
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:37,416
Professor!

634
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:42,098
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair boy!

635
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:44,537
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

636
00:51:45,174 --> 00:51:48,904
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

637
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:50,819
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

638
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:52,986
He might've mentioned it.

639
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:55,769
Well, you will do well to remember it.

640
00:51:57,243 --> 00:51:58,131
Away!

641
00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:03,630
You. Come with me.

642
00:52:39,283 --> 00:52:40,965
That's a Foe-Glass.

643
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,914
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

644
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:48,298
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

645
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:55,383
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

646
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,899
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

647
00:52:58,123 --> 00:52:59,043
Now...

648
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:03,617
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

649
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,913
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

650
00:53:12,103 --> 00:53:12,961
Sit.

651
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,726
Listen to me, Potter.

652
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:20,990
Your pal Diggory?

653
00:53:21,277 --> 00:53:25,114
By your age, he could turn a whistle into
a watch and have it sing you the time.

654
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:27,913
Miss Delacour?

655
00:53:28,323 --> 00:53:30,988
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

656
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:35,017
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

657
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:37,072
...but Karkaroff's is not.

658
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:38,756
They'll have a strategy.

659
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,104
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

660
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,109
Come on, Potter.

661
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:50,981
What are your strengths?

662
00:53:53,306 --> 00:53:54,346
I don't know.

663
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:57,439
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

664
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,287
Better than fair, the way I heard it.

665
00:53:59,832 --> 00:54:01,153
But I'm not allowed a broom.

666
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,117
You're allowed a wand.

667
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,477
Bets! Place your bets!

668
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:15,998
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

669
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:19,097
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

670
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:21,497
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

671
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,235
Yes, sir?

672
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:26,431
Ten-to-one for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

673
00:54:27,303 --> 00:54:28,894
Your attention, please.

674
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,789
This is a great day for all of us.

675
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:39,323
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

676
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,338
Please keep your seats at all times.

677
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:45,587
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

678
00:54:45,672 --> 00:54:48,435
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

679
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:51,078
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

680
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,919
- How are you feeling? Okay?
- ...the greatest of luck.

681
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,885
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

682
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,047
Battle a dragon.

683
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:08,464
Young love.

684
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:10,585
How...

685
00:55:13,183 --> 00:55:14,213
...stirring.

686
00:55:17,143 --> 00:55:20,311
If everything goes unfortunately today...

687
00:55:20,396 --> 00:55:22,620
...you two may even
make the front page.

688
00:55:23,443 --> 00:55:25,570
You have no business here.

689
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,910
This tent is for champions...

690
00:55:28,193 --> 00:55:29,534
...and friends.

691
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:36,648
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

692
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,833
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

693
00:55:42,918 --> 00:55:47,163
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

694
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:50,457
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

695
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:52,039
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

696
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,891
Sorry, I'll just go.

697
00:55:55,976 --> 00:55:57,324
Barty, the bag.

698
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:59,857
Champions, in a circle around me.

699
00:56:00,258 --> 00:56:02,790
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

700
00:56:03,645 --> 00:56:06,768
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

701
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:09,638
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

702
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:15,573
The Welsh Green.

703
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:21,599
Mr. Krum.

704
00:56:24,873 --> 00:56:26,442
The Chinese Fireball.

705
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:35,101
The Swedish Short-Snout.

706
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,218
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

707
00:56:38,303 --> 00:56:40,002
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

708
00:56:43,912 --> 00:56:46,265
The Hungarian Horntail.

709
00:56:48,563 --> 00:56:51,693
These represent four very real dragons...

710
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:54,906
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

711
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,760
Your objective is simple.

712
00:56:57,485 --> 00:56:58,732
Collect the egg.

713
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:02,498
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

714
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:05,555
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

715
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,235
Any questions?

716
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:11,291
Very well. Good luck, champions.

717
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:13,538
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

718
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:26,733
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

719
00:57:38,283 --> 00:57:41,194
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

720
00:57:41,706 --> 00:57:44,998
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

721
00:57:45,472 --> 00:57:48,660
And now our fourth and final contestant.

722
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:54,553
Harry! Harry! Harry!

723
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,680
Harry! Harry! Harry!

724
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:04,681
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

725
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:06,620
<i>Accio</i> Firebolt!

726
00:59:36,113 --> 00:59:38,273
- Yeah!
- Yes!

727
00:59:47,138 --> 00:59:48,161
Oh, my.

728
00:59:58,253 --> 01:00:01,616
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

729
01:02:33,573 --> 01:02:35,204
Yes! Yes!

730
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:57,325
Yes, Harry!

731
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:01,726
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

732
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,696
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

733
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,827
- Never!
- Never!

734
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:08,685
Shush!

735
01:03:09,555 --> 01:03:11,666
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

736
01:03:13,283 --> 01:03:16,162
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

737
01:03:16,896 --> 01:03:20,222
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

738
01:03:30,688 --> 01:03:32,451
What the bloody hell was that?

739
01:03:37,183 --> 01:03:39,692
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

740
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:43,161
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

741
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,774
I reckon you have to be barking mad to
put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

742
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:54,330
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

743
01:03:55,702 --> 01:03:57,214
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

744
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,489
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

745
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,751
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.

746
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:08,106
Least I warned you about the dragons.

747
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,877
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

748
01:04:09,963 --> 01:04:11,463
No, no, no, I did.

749
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:12,992
No, don't you remember?

750
01:04:13,464 --> 01:04:14,757
I told Hermione to tell you...

751
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:17,918
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

752
01:04:18,968 --> 01:04:22,352
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

753
01:04:24,023 --> 01:04:26,487
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

754
01:04:27,319 --> 01:04:28,564
...after you'd figured that out.

755
01:04:29,406 --> 01:04:31,696
Who...?
Who could possibly figure that out?

756
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,346
That's completely mental.

757
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:36,727
Yeah. Isn't it?

758
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:39,320
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

759
01:04:42,373 --> 01:04:43,359
Boys.

760
01:05:08,523 --> 01:05:09,585
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

761
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,688
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

762
01:05:20,153 --> 01:05:21,236
Shush.

763
01:05:22,488 --> 01:05:23,742
Look at this!

764
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:27,808
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

765
01:05:29,528 --> 01:05:31,788
"Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl..."

766
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:34,480
"...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards."

767
01:05:34,655 --> 01:05:36,949
"Her latest prey, sources report..."

768
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:40,306
"...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum."

769
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,524
"No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

770
01:05:46,473 --> 01:05:47,998
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

771
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,834
Thank you, Nigel.

772
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:56,011
Not now, Nigel.

773
01:05:57,007 --> 01:05:57,912
Later.

774
01:05:59,525 --> 01:06:00,361
Go on.

775
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,679
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

776
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:13,163
Oh, look, mom's sent me something.

777
01:06:21,382 --> 01:06:23,005
Mom sent me a dress.

778
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,460
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

779
01:06:27,603 --> 01:06:29,092
Nose down, Harry.

780
01:06:29,973 --> 01:06:33,598
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

781
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:36,778
What are you on about?

782
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,090
They're not for Ginny.

783
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:40,574
They're for you.

784
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:45,507
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

785
01:06:47,122 --> 01:06:48,605
The Yule Ball...

786
01:06:49,493 --> 01:06:54,208
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

787
01:06:55,543 --> 01:06:57,203
...since its inception.

788
01:06:58,293 --> 01:07:01,942
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

789
01:07:02,343 --> 01:07:03,926
...gather in the Great Hall...

790
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:07,918
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

791
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:12,098
As representatives of the host school...

792
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:17,465
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

793
01:07:17,692 --> 01:07:19,949
And I mean this literally, because...

794
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:24,707
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

795
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:26,984
...a dance.

796
01:07:31,453 --> 01:07:32,685
Silence!

797
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:36,538
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

798
01:07:36,623 --> 01:07:39,132
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

799
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:43,357
I will not have you, in the course of a
single evening, besmirching that name...

800
01:07:43,442 --> 01:07:47,401
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

801
01:07:48,702 --> 01:07:50,638
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

802
01:07:50,723 --> 01:07:52,082
Now, to dance...

803
01:07:52,306 --> 01:07:55,332
...is to let the body breathe.

804
01:07:56,235 --> 01:07:59,663
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

805
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:02,190
...longing to burst forth
and take flight.

806
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:04,136
Something's about to burst
out of Eloise Midgen,

807
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,716
but I don't think it's a swan.

808
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,662
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

809
01:08:09,747 --> 01:08:12,038
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

810
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:13,860
Will you join me, please?

811
01:08:19,174 --> 01:08:22,756
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

812
01:08:22,972 --> 01:08:25,191
- Where?
- My waist.

813
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:27,797
And extend your arm.

814
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,431
Mr. Filch, if you please.

815
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:35,723
One, two, three.

816
01:08:35,808 --> 01:08:39,789
One, two, three. One, two, three.

817
01:08:43,175 --> 01:08:45,004
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

818
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:46,260
- Never.
- Never.

819
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:50,173
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

820
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,719
Why do they have to travel in packs?

821
01:09:15,804 --> 01:09:17,690
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

822
01:09:26,313 --> 01:09:29,823
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

823
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:31,632
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

824
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,815
I take after my mom.

825
01:09:40,163 --> 01:09:43,941
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

826
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:46,261
No, not the maternal sort, her.

827
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:50,049
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

828
01:09:50,194 --> 01:09:51,960
I could pick him up at the age of 6

829
01:09:52,045 --> 01:09:53,743
with one hand
and put him up on the dresser.

830
01:09:54,915 --> 01:09:56,650
He laughed so hard at that.

831
01:09:59,223 --> 01:10:00,299
Very funny.

832
01:10:07,023 --> 01:10:10,079
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

833
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,283
So, I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

834
01:10:14,403 --> 01:10:16,623
But enough of me. What about you?

835
01:10:33,913 --> 01:10:35,099
This is mad.

836
01:10:35,184 --> 01:10:37,039
At this rate, we'll be the
only ones in our year

837
01:10:37,124 --> 01:10:38,156
without dates.

838
01:10:40,977 --> 01:10:43,529
Well, us and Neville.

839
01:10:44,072 --> 01:10:46,135
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

840
01:10:47,582 --> 01:10:49,880
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

841
01:10:53,323 --> 01:10:55,118
Now, I'm really depressed.

842
01:11:00,913 --> 01:11:03,403
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

843
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:07,909
Who you going with, then?

844
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,843
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

845
01:11:12,928 --> 01:11:17,840
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

846
01:11:18,898 --> 01:11:20,019
To the ball?

847
01:11:20,553 --> 01:11:21,648
Yeah, all right.

848
01:11:25,707 --> 01:11:26,790
Oi, Hermione.

849
01:11:27,433 --> 01:11:28,369
You're a girl.

850
01:11:29,273 --> 01:11:30,435
Very well spotted.

851
01:11:30,725 --> 01:11:31,669
Come with one of us?

852
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,026
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

853
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,692
For a girl, it's just sad.

854
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,952
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

855
01:11:52,753 --> 01:11:54,245
And I said yes!

856
01:11:56,498 --> 01:11:57,801
Bloody hell.

857
01:11:58,267 --> 01:11:59,375
She's lying, right?

858
01:12:00,223 --> 01:12:01,388
If you say so.

859
01:12:02,143 --> 01:12:05,227
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

860
01:12:05,728 --> 01:12:07,605
Tonight, when we get back
to the common room...

861
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,496
...we'll both have partners. Agreed?

862
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,521
Agreed.

863
01:12:35,257 --> 01:12:36,683
- Cho!
- Harry!

864
01:12:40,598 --> 01:12:43,081
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

865
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,451
Okay, thanks.

866
01:12:49,473 --> 01:12:50,491
Cho?

867
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:52,326
Yes?

868
01:12:54,393 --> 01:12:56,468
Well, I just wondered if you...

869
01:12:56,553 --> 01:12:58,741
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

870
01:13:01,283 --> 01:13:02,940
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

871
01:13:04,453 --> 01:13:08,958
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

872
01:13:15,373 --> 01:13:16,405
Harry...

873
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:19,352
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

874
01:13:20,794 --> 01:13:21,720
And...

875
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:25,937
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

876
01:13:28,046 --> 01:13:30,541
Okay. Yeah. Great.

877
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:33,984
Fine. No problem.

878
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:36,042
Okay. Good.

879
01:13:37,943 --> 01:13:38,799
Harry?

880
01:13:40,356 --> 01:13:41,316
I really am...

881
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,102
...sorry.

882
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:55,078
It's all right, Ron.

883
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:57,723
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

884
01:13:58,469 --> 01:13:59,543
What happened to you?

885
01:14:00,673 --> 01:14:02,291
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

886
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:03,660
What?

887
01:14:04,217 --> 01:14:05,232
What did she say?

888
01:14:05,673 --> 01:14:06,899
No, of course.

889
01:14:08,593 --> 01:14:11,431
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

890
01:14:12,298 --> 01:14:14,039
There she was, walking by.

891
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:16,643
You know how I like it when they walk.

892
01:14:17,523 --> 01:14:20,601
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

893
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:24,254
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

894
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:29,494
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

895
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,601
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

896
01:14:33,686 --> 01:14:34,774
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

897
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:37,727
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

898
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:41,505
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

899
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:43,633
Hey!

900
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,005
Bloody hell.

901
01:15:04,704 --> 01:15:05,998
Bloody hell.

902
01:15:09,842 --> 01:15:10,676
Bloody...

903
01:15:11,238 --> 01:15:12,528
Oh, bloody...

904
01:15:16,357 --> 01:15:19,118
What are those? What are those?

905
01:15:19,203 --> 01:15:21,804
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

906
01:15:22,296 --> 01:15:24,790
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

907
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:27,532
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

908
01:15:27,617 --> 01:15:29,897
Traditional? They're ancient!

909
01:15:30,669 --> 01:15:32,327
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

910
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:37,539
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

911
01:15:42,726 --> 01:15:44,179
Murder me, Harry.

912
01:15:45,952 --> 01:15:47,116
Leave it alone!

913
01:15:48,613 --> 01:15:49,786
Poor kid.

914
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:52,117
I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

915
01:15:52,203 --> 01:15:54,863
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

916
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:58,248
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

917
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,587
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

918
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,223
Nobody asked her.

919
01:16:03,223 --> 01:16:05,960
Would've taken her myself if
she wasn't so bloody proud.

920
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:08,274
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

921
01:16:08,688 --> 01:16:09,766
Don't you look...

922
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,124
...dashing.

923
01:16:12,888 --> 01:16:15,568
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

924
01:16:16,143 --> 01:16:18,238
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

925
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,136
It's traditional that
the three champions...

926
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,522
Well, in this case, four.
Are the first to dance.

927
01:16:22,733 --> 01:16:25,241
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

928
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:27,209
Well, now you know.

929
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:33,377
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

930
01:16:33,768 --> 01:16:35,982
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

931
01:16:36,067 --> 01:16:37,227
Come along this way.

932
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:44,114
Oh, come on.

933
01:16:45,253 --> 01:16:47,499
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

934
01:16:47,584 --> 01:16:48,965
...in the procession, please.

935
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,752
Oh, you are very late.

936
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:55,089
This way. This way. Come along.

937
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:58,803
She looks beautiful!

938
01:16:59,556 --> 01:17:00,676
Yeah, she does.

939
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:51,512
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

940
01:17:52,693 --> 01:17:55,136
No. Absolutely not.

941
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:00,799
Hi!

942
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:12,134
Harry, take my waist.

943
01:18:13,113 --> 01:18:14,180
- What?
- Now!

944
01:19:21,085 --> 01:19:22,821
Are you ready?

945
01:19:23,653 --> 01:19:26,070
<i>Move your body like a hairy troll</i>

946
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:29,127
<i>Learning to rock and roll</i>

947
01:19:29,353 --> 01:19:32,026
<i>Spin around like a crazy elf</i>

948
01:19:32,663 --> 01:19:34,971
<i>Dancing by himself</i>

949
01:19:35,213 --> 01:19:38,107
<i>Boogie down like a unicorn</i>

950
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:40,962
<i>No stopping till the break of dawn</i>

951
01:19:41,212 --> 01:19:44,032
<i>Put your hands up in the air</i>

952
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:46,971
<i>Like an ogre who just don't care</i>

953
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:50,459
<i>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</i>

954
01:19:52,694 --> 01:19:54,311
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

955
01:19:57,397 --> 01:19:59,793
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

956
01:20:02,414 --> 01:20:03,686
May I have your arm?

957
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:06,693
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

958
01:20:32,765 --> 01:20:33,903
Hot, isn't it?

959
01:20:35,175 --> 01:20:38,101
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

960
01:20:38,653 --> 01:20:41,677
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

961
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:45,653
What's got your wand in a knot?

962
01:20:46,653 --> 01:20:48,044
He's a Durmstrang.

963
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:49,983
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

964
01:20:50,354 --> 01:20:51,352
The enemy?

965
01:20:52,564 --> 01:20:54,349
Who was it wanting his autograph?

966
01:20:54,793 --> 01:20:57,046
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament is...

967
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:00,422
...international magical cooperation...

968
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:02,955
...to make friends.

969
01:21:03,753 --> 01:21:06,127
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

970
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:18,707
Are you going to ask me to dance or not?

971
01:21:19,269 --> 01:21:20,221
No.

972
01:21:28,523 --> 01:21:31,424
- He's using you.
- How dare you?

973
01:21:31,702 --> 01:21:33,581
Besides, I can take care of myself.

974
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:35,825
I doubt it. He's way too old.

975
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:38,522
What? What? That's what you think?

976
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:39,733
Yeah, that's what I think.

977
01:21:39,818 --> 01:21:41,755
You know the solution then, don't you?

978
01:21:42,173 --> 01:21:43,058
Go on.

979
01:21:43,324 --> 01:21:44,386
Next time there's a ball

980
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:47,467
pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

981
01:21:47,552 --> 01:21:49,465
And not as a last resort.

982
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:53,663
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

983
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:55,223
Harry.

984
01:21:56,013 --> 01:21:57,127
Where have you been?

985
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,219
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

986
01:22:02,813 --> 01:22:06,648
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

987
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:08,124
What's this about?

988
01:22:13,163 --> 01:22:16,015
<i>No, don't let</i>

989
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:22,216
<i>This magic die</i>

990
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:26,635
<i>The answer's there</i>

991
01:23:25,143 --> 01:23:26,727
Let me see it again.

992
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:31,258
Yes, the time is close now.

993
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,014
Harry, at last!

994
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:44,533
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

995
01:23:55,223 --> 01:23:56,526
You all right, Harry?

996
01:23:58,093 --> 01:23:59,278
I just got in.

997
01:24:00,473 --> 01:24:01,531
Me.

998
01:24:12,983 --> 01:24:15,856
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

999
01:24:16,364 --> 01:24:18,255
The task is two days from now.

1000
01:24:18,389 --> 01:24:19,975
Really? I had no idea.

1001
01:24:22,248 --> 01:24:24,038
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

1002
01:24:24,123 --> 01:24:26,223
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

1003
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:32,054
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

1004
01:24:36,418 --> 01:24:39,094
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

1005
01:24:40,016 --> 01:24:41,682
Mostly, he watches me study.

1006
01:24:43,223 --> 01:24:44,667
It's a bit annoying, actually.

1007
01:24:46,683 --> 01:24:48,622
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

1008
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:51,480
What's that supposed to mean?

1009
01:24:52,313 --> 01:24:54,566
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

1010
01:24:55,483 --> 01:24:56,581
...in the most brutal way.

1011
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:58,012
They're almost cruel.

1012
01:24:59,823 --> 01:25:00,697
And...

1013
01:25:03,783 --> 01:25:04,967
...I'm scared for you.

1014
01:25:06,623 --> 01:25:08,591
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

1015
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,636
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

1016
01:25:12,503 --> 01:25:13,420
Hey, Potter!

1017
01:25:19,923 --> 01:25:21,438
- Potter!
- Cedric.

1018
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:25,185
How...? How are you?

1019
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:27,801
Spectacular.

1020
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,763
Look, I realize I never really
thanked you properly

1021
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:33,595
for tipping me off about those dragons.

1022
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,666
Forget about it.

1023
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,254
I'm sure you would've
done the same for me.

1024
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,212
Exactly.

1025
01:25:39,113 --> 01:25:41,479
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

1026
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,537
It's not a bad place for a bath.

1027
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,286
Just take your egg and...

1028
01:25:53,036 --> 01:25:55,096
...mull things over in the hot water.

1029
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,167
I must be out of my mind.

1030
01:26:43,423 --> 01:26:44,907
I'm definitely out of my mind.

1031
01:26:48,263 --> 01:26:51,258
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

1032
01:26:51,723 --> 01:26:52,708
Myrtle!

1033
01:26:53,527 --> 01:26:54,664
Hello, Harry.

1034
01:26:55,987 --> 01:26:58,756
Long time no see.

1035
01:27:03,696 --> 01:27:07,501
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

1036
01:27:07,586 --> 01:27:10,887
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

1037
01:27:11,242 --> 01:27:13,658
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

1038
01:27:13,743 --> 01:27:14,973
Polyjuice Potion?

1039
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,138
Kicked the habit.

1040
01:27:17,223 --> 01:27:20,373
Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

1041
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,690
That's what he did.

1042
01:27:29,534 --> 01:27:30,835
The other boy...

1043
01:27:32,628 --> 01:27:34,256
...the handsome one...

1044
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:37,343
...Cedric.

1045
01:27:40,653 --> 01:27:43,142
Well, go on. Open it.

1046
01:27:51,493 --> 01:27:56,517
<i>Come seek us where our voices sound</i>

1047
01:27:56,602 --> 01:28:01,276
<i>We cannot sing above the ground</i>

1048
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:06,002
<i>An hour long you'll have to look</i>

1049
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:11,199
<i>To recover what we took</i>

1050
01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:20,320
Myrtle...

1051
01:28:22,353 --> 01:28:25,173
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

1052
01:28:26,606 --> 01:28:28,272
Very good.

1053
01:28:29,212 --> 01:28:33,331
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

1054
01:28:34,123 --> 01:28:37,429
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

1055
01:28:55,544 --> 01:28:56,841
Harry, tell me again.

1056
01:28:59,088 --> 01:29:01,874
"Come seek us where our voices sound."

1057
01:29:02,113 --> 01:29:04,386
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

1058
01:29:05,733 --> 01:29:07,716
"An hour long you'll have to look."

1059
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:09,586
Again, obvious.

1060
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:11,962
Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

1061
01:29:13,283 --> 01:29:14,845
"Potentially problematic"?

1062
01:29:15,106 --> 01:29:18,320
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1063
01:29:19,123 --> 01:29:23,497
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1064
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:25,776
Hate to break up the skull session.

1065
01:29:26,102 --> 01:29:28,223
Professor McGonagall
would like to see you in her office.

1066
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,570
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1067
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:33,629
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1068
01:29:33,714 --> 01:29:34,562
Exactly.

1069
01:29:34,647 --> 01:29:36,492
Presumably Potter is well prepared by now

1070
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:38,502
and could do with a good night's sleep.

1071
01:29:38,683 --> 01:29:40,381
Go. Now!

1072
01:29:51,233 --> 01:29:52,094
Longbottom!

1073
01:29:53,149 --> 01:29:55,236
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1074
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:06,166
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1075
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,833
...you'd be better off with
"Goshawk's Guide to Herbology".

1076
01:30:09,328 --> 01:30:13,732
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1077
01:30:13,817 --> 01:30:17,703
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1078
01:30:18,236 --> 01:30:19,212
...about plants.

1079
01:30:20,298 --> 01:30:21,436
Now, if there's a...

1080
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,645
...Tibetan turnip that will allow me

1081
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:28,019
to breathe underwater
for an hour then great.

1082
01:30:28,997 --> 01:30:29,840
But otherwise...

1083
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:33,047
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1084
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:37,052
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1085
01:30:37,913 --> 01:30:39,533
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1086
01:30:39,618 --> 01:30:40,848
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1087
01:30:40,933 --> 01:30:42,640
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1088
01:30:43,352 --> 01:30:44,405
Don't be so mean.

1089
01:30:45,678 --> 01:30:47,515
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1090
01:30:49,748 --> 01:30:51,538
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1091
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:53,526
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1092
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,813
Most likely?

1093
01:30:55,638 --> 01:30:57,848
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1094
01:30:57,933 --> 01:31:00,331
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1095
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:03,100
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1096
01:31:03,185 --> 01:31:05,175
I just wanted to help.

1097
01:31:05,523 --> 01:31:07,857
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1098
01:31:08,739 --> 01:31:10,112
Where are they anyway?

1099
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:13,008
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1100
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:22,779
Welcome to the second task.

1101
01:31:23,203 --> 01:31:26,514
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1102
01:31:26,994 --> 01:31:28,313
A treasure of sorts.

1103
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:31,360
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1104
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,658
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1105
01:31:34,174 --> 01:31:35,413
In order to win...

1106
01:31:35,498 --> 01:31:39,422
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1107
01:31:39,798 --> 01:31:42,521
- Simple enough, except for this.
- Put that in your mouth.

1108
01:31:42,606 --> 01:31:46,243
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1109
01:31:46,519 --> 01:31:50,487
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1110
01:31:50,976 --> 01:31:53,258
You may begin at the sound of the cannon.

1111
01:32:19,803 --> 01:32:22,668
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1112
01:32:24,016 --> 01:32:26,868
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1113
01:32:28,879 --> 01:32:30,709
Yeah!

1114
01:32:31,983 --> 01:32:32,945
What?

1115
01:33:53,183 --> 01:33:55,389
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1116
01:33:55,474 --> 01:33:58,006
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1117
01:33:58,609 --> 01:34:01,005
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1118
01:35:19,563 --> 01:35:21,150
But she's my friend too!

1119
01:35:22,896 --> 01:35:24,211
Only one!

1120
01:36:16,073 --> 01:36:17,401
Let's get down below.

1121
01:36:28,003 --> 01:36:30,889
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1122
01:37:27,876 --> 01:37:29,245
Yes!

1123
01:37:48,139 --> 01:37:49,918
<i>Ascendio!</i>

1124
01:37:55,463 --> 01:37:56,542
Harry!

1125
01:37:59,544 --> 01:38:00,482
He's all right.

1126
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,153
He's all right. Barty!

1127
01:38:03,763 --> 01:38:04,993
Go get him another towel.

1128
01:38:05,078 --> 01:38:07,136
I want all the judges over here now!

1129
01:38:07,773 --> 01:38:11,266
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1130
01:38:11,943 --> 01:38:13,353
My little sister.

1131
01:38:14,023 --> 01:38:15,049
Thank you.

1132
01:38:16,403 --> 01:38:18,517
And you! You helped.

1133
01:38:19,608 --> 01:38:21,813
Well, yeah, a bit.

1134
01:38:28,219 --> 01:38:29,331
<i>Merci.</i>

1135
01:38:29,828 --> 01:38:31,119
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1136
01:38:31,204 --> 01:38:33,307
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1137
01:38:35,022 --> 01:38:37,014
Personally, I think
you behaved admirably.

1138
01:38:37,343 --> 01:38:39,040
I finished last, Hermione.

1139
01:38:40,223 --> 01:38:44,041
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1140
01:38:44,126 --> 01:38:47,556
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1141
01:38:47,933 --> 01:38:49,996
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1142
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,689
Attention!

1143
01:38:56,065 --> 01:38:59,919
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1144
01:39:00,488 --> 01:39:03,732
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1145
01:39:04,278 --> 01:39:06,948
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1146
01:39:07,033 --> 01:39:11,812
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1147
01:39:11,897 --> 01:39:15,852
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1148
01:39:16,485 --> 01:39:17,881
...second place...

1149
01:39:18,813 --> 01:39:20,338
- Second place!
- Well done!

1150
01:39:20,423 --> 01:39:22,933
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1151
01:39:24,343 --> 01:39:25,890
Yes!

1152
01:39:29,473 --> 01:39:31,263
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1153
01:39:31,348 --> 01:39:33,022
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1154
01:39:33,107 --> 01:39:35,445
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1155
01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:38,148
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1156
01:39:38,523 --> 01:39:40,210
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1157
01:39:40,295 --> 01:39:41,176
Well done, boy.

1158
01:39:42,073 --> 01:39:44,908
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1159
01:39:45,443 --> 01:39:49,502
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1160
01:39:50,493 --> 01:39:51,637
Quite remarkable, really.

1161
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:53,429
Tragic, of course...

1162
01:39:54,123 --> 01:39:55,630
...to lose one's family.

1163
01:39:58,077 --> 01:39:59,637
Never whole again, are we?

1164
01:40:02,388 --> 01:40:04,286
Still, life goes on...

1165
01:40:05,303 --> 01:40:06,428
...and here we stand.

1166
01:40:09,893 --> 01:40:12,563
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1167
01:40:12,648 --> 01:40:13,762
Bartemius!

1168
01:40:14,393 --> 01:40:18,124
Not trying to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1169
01:40:18,497 --> 01:40:21,210
The last boy who went into the
Department of Mysteries never came out!

1170
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:35,702
And they say I'm mad.

1171
01:40:45,553 --> 01:40:48,746
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1172
01:40:49,347 --> 01:40:52,363
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1173
01:40:52,973 --> 01:40:54,857
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1174
01:40:55,426 --> 01:40:58,172
And here we all are, four years later.

1175
01:40:58,513 --> 01:40:59,857
We're still a bunch of misfits.

1176
01:40:59,942 --> 01:41:02,607
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1177
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:04,474
And Harry, of course.

1178
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:10,082
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1179
01:41:10,569 --> 01:41:11,717
Hooray!

1180
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:16,772
<i>Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</i>

1181
01:41:16,857 --> 01:41:19,472
<i>Teach us something, please</i>

1182
01:41:29,354 --> 01:41:30,487
Mr. Crouch?

1183
01:41:38,063 --> 01:41:39,845
A man has died here, Fudge.

1184
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:41,776
And he won't be the last.
You must take action.

1185
01:41:41,868 --> 01:41:43,241
I will not.

1186
01:41:43,455 --> 01:41:44,682
In times like these,

1187
01:41:44,767 --> 01:41:47,769
the wizard world looks to its
leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1188
01:41:47,854 --> 01:41:49,053
Then for once show them some!

1189
01:41:49,138 --> 01:41:51,577
The Triwizard Tournament
will not be canceled.

1190
01:41:51,662 --> 01:41:53,554
I will not be seen as a coward!

1191
01:41:53,639 --> 01:41:56,601
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1192
01:41:56,686 --> 01:41:57,801
What did you say?

1193
01:41:57,886 --> 01:41:59,522
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1194
01:41:59,784 --> 01:42:02,697
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1195
01:42:07,923 --> 01:42:08,920
Oh, Harry!

1196
01:42:09,555 --> 01:42:11,725
Harry, how good to see you again.

1197
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,388
I can come back later, professor.

1198
01:42:14,473 --> 01:42:15,518
Not necessary, Harry.

1199
01:42:15,603 --> 01:42:17,951
The minister and I are done.
I'll be back in a moment.

1200
01:42:18,036 --> 01:42:19,870
Minister, after you.

1201
01:42:21,103 --> 01:42:23,110
There you are. Your hat.

1202
01:42:23,195 --> 01:42:26,754
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1203
01:42:26,839 --> 01:42:29,841
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1204
01:44:01,743 --> 01:44:02,795
Professor?

1205
01:44:03,543 --> 01:44:05,201
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1206
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:20,792
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1207
01:44:20,877 --> 01:44:22,804
...to present evidence to this council.

1208
01:44:22,947 --> 01:44:25,466
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1209
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:29,280
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1210
01:44:30,153 --> 01:44:33,207
Until such time, you remain
in the eyes of the Ministry

1211
01:44:33,292 --> 01:44:34,702
a convicted Death Eater.

1212
01:44:34,787 --> 01:44:36,392
Do you accept these terms?

1213
01:44:37,153 --> 01:44:39,125
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1214
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,037
I have names, sir.

1215
01:44:43,054 --> 01:44:46,470
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1216
01:44:49,392 --> 01:44:50,628
Rosier is dead.

1217
01:44:50,713 --> 01:44:53,068
He took a piece of me with him
though, didn't he?

1218
01:44:53,234 --> 01:44:54,377
I didn't know.

1219
01:44:54,462 --> 01:44:55,954
If that is all the
witness has to offer...

1220
01:44:56,039 --> 01:44:57,138
No, no, no.

1221
01:44:57,303 --> 01:44:59,912
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1222
01:45:00,763 --> 01:45:03,218
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1223
01:45:03,303 --> 01:45:04,471
Yeah, yeah the same.

1224
01:45:04,556 --> 01:45:07,713
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1225
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,428
Very well.

1226
01:45:10,983 --> 01:45:12,250
Council will deliberate.

1227
01:45:13,015 --> 01:45:15,022
In the meantime,
you will be returned to Azkaban.

1228
01:45:15,107 --> 01:45:19,849
No! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1229
01:45:19,934 --> 01:45:22,983
As the council is very much aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1230
01:45:23,068 --> 01:45:25,157
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater

1231
01:45:25,242 --> 01:45:27,180
and, prior to Lord
Voldemort's downfall...

1232
01:45:27,265 --> 01:45:29,479
...turned spy for us at
great personal risk.

1233
01:45:29,564 --> 01:45:30,418
It's a lie!

1234
01:45:30,503 --> 01:45:32,001
Today he's no more a Death Eater than I.

1235
01:45:32,086 --> 01:45:33,926
Severus Snape remains faithful
to the Dark Lord!

1236
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:36,039
Silence!

1237
01:45:37,003 --> 01:45:40,352
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1238
01:45:40,437 --> 01:45:42,387
...this session is now concluded.

1239
01:45:42,883 --> 01:45:44,532
Oh, no, no, no.

1240
01:45:46,018 --> 01:45:47,478
I've heard about one more.

1241
01:45:47,563 --> 01:45:49,388
- What's that?
- The name.

1242
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:51,808
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1243
01:45:51,893 --> 01:45:53,624
...this person took part
in the capture...

1244
01:45:54,012 --> 01:45:56,358
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1245
01:45:56,443 --> 01:46:00,116
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1246
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,475
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1247
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,743
Barty Crouch...

1248
01:46:07,873 --> 01:46:08,951
...Junior.

1249
01:46:18,383 --> 01:46:19,648
Hold him down!

1250
01:46:23,723 --> 01:46:26,832
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1251
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:30,161
Hello, Father.

1252
01:46:31,987 --> 01:46:33,504
You are no son of mine.

1253
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:49,260
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1254
01:46:51,283 --> 01:46:52,611
It's a Pensieve.

1255
01:46:52,696 --> 01:46:56,982
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1256
01:46:57,673 --> 01:47:00,732
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1257
01:47:01,673 --> 01:47:04,403
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1258
01:47:04,803 --> 01:47:06,576
...some small detail...

1259
01:47:07,803 --> 01:47:09,428
...something I might have overlooked...

1260
01:47:10,103 --> 01:47:13,620
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1261
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:18,789
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1262
01:47:19,938 --> 01:47:21,249
It's maddening.

1263
01:47:23,138 --> 01:47:25,464
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1264
01:47:26,493 --> 01:47:28,189
What exactly happened to him?

1265
01:47:28,664 --> 01:47:30,467
He was sent to Azkaban.

1266
01:47:31,366 --> 01:47:32,992
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1267
01:47:34,203 --> 01:47:37,386
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1268
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:41,532
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1269
01:47:43,003 --> 01:47:44,782
I had a dream about him.

1270
01:47:47,383 --> 01:47:49,616
It was in the summer, before school.

1271
01:47:52,353 --> 01:47:54,667
In the dream, I was in a house.

1272
01:47:55,523 --> 01:47:59,778
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1273
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:03,292
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1274
01:48:04,483 --> 01:48:06,985
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1275
01:48:08,153 --> 01:48:09,359
Always the same one.

1276
01:48:12,703 --> 01:48:14,836
Sir, these dreams...

1277
01:48:15,207 --> 01:48:19,550
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1278
01:48:22,123 --> 01:48:24,772
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1279
01:48:25,553 --> 01:48:27,206
I think it's best if you simply...

1280
01:48:33,223 --> 01:48:34,480
...cast them away.

1281
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:47,531
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1282
01:48:56,929 --> 01:48:57,866
Potter!

1283
01:48:58,333 --> 01:49:00,554
What's your hurry?

1284
01:49:06,018 --> 01:49:09,280
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1285
01:49:09,923 --> 01:49:11,564
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1286
01:49:12,885 --> 01:49:13,753
Yes, sir.

1287
01:49:15,433 --> 01:49:16,375
Ingenious.

1288
01:49:18,643 --> 01:49:21,786
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1289
01:49:23,443 --> 01:49:26,464
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1290
01:49:28,613 --> 01:49:30,246
Nor is this.

1291
01:49:34,783 --> 01:49:35,793
Know what it is?

1292
01:49:37,743 --> 01:49:39,151
Bubble juice, sir?

1293
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,303
Veritaserum.

1294
01:49:42,373 --> 01:49:46,137
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1295
01:49:46,222 --> 01:49:49,806
The use of it on a student
is, regrettably, forbidden.

1296
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:50,743
However...

1297
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:55,149
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1298
01:49:55,234 --> 01:50:00,281
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1299
01:50:00,366 --> 01:50:04,746
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1300
01:50:05,853 --> 01:50:11,869
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1301
01:50:12,283 --> 01:50:15,613
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1302
01:50:15,698 --> 01:50:17,056
...I'm going to find out why!

1303
01:50:44,813 --> 01:50:46,502
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1304
01:51:05,416 --> 01:51:07,015
<i>Sonorus!</i>

1305
01:51:11,256 --> 01:51:16,636
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1306
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,896
Only he knows its exact position.

1307
01:51:19,385 --> 01:51:21,086
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1308
01:51:23,933 --> 01:51:25,013
...and Mr. Potter...

1309
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:29,211
...are tied for first position...

1310
01:51:29,296 --> 01:51:31,355
...they will be the first
to enter the maze,

1311
01:51:31,646 --> 01:51:32,905
followed by Mr. Krum...

1312
01:51:34,617 --> 01:51:37,874
- ...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1313
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:42,436
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1314
01:51:46,663 --> 01:51:49,347
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1315
01:51:49,533 --> 01:51:52,374
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1316
01:51:52,459 --> 01:51:56,666
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1317
01:51:57,375 --> 01:52:00,423
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1318
01:52:04,465 --> 01:52:08,367
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1319
01:52:09,063 --> 01:52:12,047
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1320
01:52:12,412 --> 01:52:15,559
You see, people change in the maze.

1321
01:52:15,644 --> 01:52:17,497
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1322
01:52:17,745 --> 01:52:21,732
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1323
01:52:23,913 --> 01:52:26,374
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1324
01:52:34,703 --> 01:52:36,462
Cedric, good luck.

1325
01:52:37,555 --> 01:52:38,842
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1326
01:52:42,327 --> 01:52:44,683
On the count of three. One...

1327
01:56:12,219 --> 01:56:13,215
Fleur?

1328
01:56:15,383 --> 01:56:16,280
Fleur.

1329
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:21,542
<i>Periculum!</i>

1330
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:01,850
Get down!

1331
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:04,045
Get down!

1332
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:06,375
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1333
01:57:16,042 --> 01:57:19,282
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1334
01:57:19,367 --> 01:57:20,899
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1335
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:34,136
Yes.

1336
01:57:55,592 --> 01:57:56,735
Harry!

1337
01:57:59,736 --> 01:58:00,757
Harry!

1338
01:58:03,548 --> 01:58:04,518
Harry!

1339
01:58:07,698 --> 01:58:08,713
Harry!

1340
01:58:11,007 --> 01:58:12,181
<i>Reducto!</i>

1341
01:58:29,933 --> 01:58:31,698
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1342
01:58:32,813 --> 01:58:36,990
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1343
01:58:37,693 --> 01:58:38,846
For a moment, so did I.

1344
01:58:41,323 --> 01:58:42,493
Some game, huh?

1345
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:44,368
Some game.

1346
01:58:50,484 --> 01:58:51,446
Go!

1347
01:59:02,133 --> 01:59:04,777
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1348
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,293
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1349
01:59:07,378 --> 01:59:08,355
...three!
...three!

1350
01:59:20,852 --> 01:59:23,508
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1351
01:59:31,076 --> 01:59:32,257
Where are we?

1352
01:59:38,086 --> 01:59:39,319
I've been here before.

1353
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:44,622
It's a Portkey.

1354
01:59:46,917 --> 01:59:50,398
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1355
01:59:52,963 --> 01:59:55,484
Cedric! We have to get back to the cup.

1356
01:59:55,922 --> 01:59:56,783
Now!

1357
01:59:56,868 --> 01:59:57,952
What are you talking about?

1358
02:00:03,993 --> 02:00:06,273
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1359
02:00:14,265 --> 02:00:16,958
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1360
02:00:17,043 --> 02:00:19,954
<i>- Avada Kedavra!</i>
- No! Cedric!

1361
02:00:30,968 --> 02:00:32,779
Do it! Now!

1362
02:00:44,792 --> 02:00:47,121
Bone of the father...

1363
02:00:47,366 --> 02:00:49,924
...unwillingly given.

1364
02:00:57,294 --> 02:01:00,294
Flesh of the servant...

1365
02:01:02,415 --> 02:01:05,082
...willingly sacrificed.

1366
02:01:09,779 --> 02:01:12,479
And blood of the enemy...

1367
02:01:19,107 --> 02:01:21,453
...forcibly taken.

1368
02:01:27,823 --> 02:01:30,820
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1369
02:01:31,533 --> 02:01:32,451
...again.

1370
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:39,424
My wand, Wormtail.

1371
02:02:49,823 --> 02:02:51,417
Hold out your arm.

1372
02:02:52,037 --> 02:02:53,122
Master.

1373
02:02:53,697 --> 02:02:55,784
Thank you, master.

1374
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:58,014
The other arm, Wormtail.

1375
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,039
Welcome, my friends.

1376
02:03:41,867 --> 02:03:44,798
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1377
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:49,955
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1378
02:03:51,819 --> 02:03:53,814
I confess myself...

1379
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:56,279
...disappointed.

1380
02:03:57,423 --> 02:03:59,395
Not one of you tried to find me.

1381
02:03:59,683 --> 02:04:03,054
Crabbe! Macnair!

1382
02:04:03,863 --> 02:04:05,025
Goyle!

1383
02:04:07,646 --> 02:04:08,835
Not even you...

1384
02:04:13,266 --> 02:04:14,354
...Lucius.

1385
02:04:17,073 --> 02:04:21,742
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1386
02:04:21,827 --> 02:04:25,105
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1387
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:30,359
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1388
02:04:32,164 --> 02:04:37,613
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1389
02:04:39,763 --> 02:04:41,673
...that is my true mask.

1390
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:43,814
I returned.

1391
02:04:46,678 --> 02:04:49,792
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1392
02:04:51,749 --> 02:04:56,818
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1393
02:05:02,624 --> 02:05:05,043
Thank you, master.

1394
02:05:05,646 --> 02:05:06,732
Thank you.

1395
02:05:10,583 --> 02:05:12,885
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1396
02:05:14,423 --> 02:05:15,451
Harry.

1397
02:05:16,025 --> 02:05:18,585
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1398
02:05:19,045 --> 02:05:21,663
Standing on the bones of my father.

1399
02:05:22,452 --> 02:05:23,387
Yeah.

1400
02:05:23,612 --> 02:05:24,631
I'd introduce you...

1401
02:05:24,716 --> 02:05:28,800
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1402
02:05:32,056 --> 02:05:34,318
The boy who lived.

1403
02:05:34,904 --> 02:05:37,736
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1404
02:05:38,042 --> 02:05:41,617
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1405
02:05:41,913 --> 02:05:46,481
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1406
02:05:46,993 --> 02:05:48,167
Yes, shall I?

1407
02:05:49,115 --> 02:05:50,112
It was love.

1408
02:05:50,644 --> 02:05:54,952
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1409
02:05:55,037 --> 02:05:57,633
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1410
02:05:58,143 --> 02:05:59,384
I could not touch him.

1411
02:06:01,167 --> 02:06:03,071
It was old magic.

1412
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:05,265
Something I should have foreseen.

1413
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:07,532
But no matter, no matter.

1414
02:06:07,929 --> 02:06:09,773
Things have changed.

1415
02:06:10,869 --> 02:06:13,462
I can touch you...

1416
02:06:14,976 --> 02:06:15,868
...now.

1417
02:06:24,913 --> 02:06:25,783
Yeah.

1418
02:06:32,504 --> 02:06:35,590
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1419
02:06:36,963 --> 02:06:38,445
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1420
02:06:40,702 --> 02:06:43,075
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1421
02:06:44,688 --> 02:06:46,827
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1422
02:06:46,912 --> 02:06:49,249
First, we bow to each other.

1423
02:06:49,683 --> 02:06:52,093
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1424
02:06:52,178 --> 02:06:54,846
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1425
02:06:55,190 --> 02:06:57,024
I said, bow.

1426
02:06:58,813 --> 02:07:02,444
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1427
02:07:03,406 --> 02:07:04,563
<i>Crucio!</i>

1428
02:07:07,792 --> 02:07:09,081
<i>Crucio!</i>

1429
02:07:10,703 --> 02:07:12,143
Attaboy, Harry.

1430
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:14,507
Your parents would be proud.

1431
02:07:15,122 --> 02:07:18,261
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1432
02:07:18,346 --> 02:07:19,353
<i>Expelliar...</i>

1433
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,547
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1434
02:07:26,013 --> 02:07:27,480
I'm going to destroy you.

1435
02:07:30,183 --> 02:07:35,661
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1436
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:39,004
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1437
02:07:39,089 --> 02:07:40,922
...they'll speak only of how you...

1438
02:07:42,052 --> 02:07:43,299
...begged for death.

1439
02:07:44,113 --> 02:07:46,689
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1440
02:07:48,403 --> 02:07:49,429
...obliged.

1441
02:07:50,363 --> 02:07:51,258
Get up!

1442
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:58,668
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1443
02:07:58,753 --> 02:08:01,079
I want you to look at me when I kill you!

1444
02:08:01,309 --> 02:08:04,046
I want to see the light leave your eyes!

1445
02:08:18,443 --> 02:08:19,443
Have it your way.

1446
02:08:21,353 --> 02:08:23,084
<i>- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!</i>

1447
02:08:41,253 --> 02:08:43,760
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1448
02:08:48,503 --> 02:08:49,858
He's mine!

1449
02:09:23,269 --> 02:09:26,982
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1450
02:09:27,415 --> 02:09:29,336
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1451
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:31,211
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1452
02:09:32,633 --> 02:09:35,246
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1453
02:09:36,048 --> 02:09:37,766
Take my body back to my father.

1454
02:09:39,433 --> 02:09:40,546
Let go.

1455
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:42,682
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1456
02:09:44,023 --> 02:09:46,577
Let go! Let go!

1457
02:09:52,403 --> 02:09:53,846
<i>Accio!</i>

1458
02:09:59,325 --> 02:10:01,334
No!

1459
02:10:14,213 --> 02:10:15,474
He did it!

1460
02:10:17,173 --> 02:10:18,149
Harry!

1461
02:10:21,069 --> 02:10:22,127
Harry!

1462
02:10:24,032 --> 02:10:26,657
No! No! No, don't!

1463
02:10:27,948 --> 02:10:29,818
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1464
02:10:29,903 --> 02:10:32,033
He's back. He's back.

1465
02:10:32,714 --> 02:10:34,030
Voldemort's back.

1466
02:10:34,405 --> 02:10:36,811
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1467
02:10:37,024 --> 02:10:39,570
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1468
02:10:39,655 --> 02:10:42,296
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1469
02:10:42,990 --> 02:10:45,233
He's home. You both are.

1470
02:10:45,318 --> 02:10:48,595
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1471
02:10:52,043 --> 02:10:55,441
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1472
02:10:55,887 --> 02:10:56,832
Let me through.

1473
02:10:57,813 --> 02:10:58,856
Let me through!

1474
02:11:01,239 --> 02:11:02,409
Let me through!

1475
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:04,153
That's my son!

1476
02:11:05,349 --> 02:11:06,925
That's my boy!

1477
02:11:09,733 --> 02:11:11,611
It's my boy!

1478
02:11:15,233 --> 02:11:18,049
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1479
02:11:19,102 --> 02:11:21,332
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1480
02:11:22,377 --> 02:11:24,728
No!

1481
02:11:27,913 --> 02:11:29,679
It's all right, I got you.

1482
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:33,129
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1483
02:11:37,803 --> 02:11:39,074
No!

1484
02:11:40,624 --> 02:11:42,372
No!

1485
02:12:24,973 --> 02:12:26,057
Are you all right, Potter?

1486
02:12:27,344 --> 02:12:28,841
Does it hurt? That?

1487
02:12:29,353 --> 02:12:30,592
Not so much now.

1488
02:12:32,103 --> 02:12:33,532
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1489
02:12:37,313 --> 02:12:38,658
The cup was a Portkey.

1490
02:12:42,033 --> 02:12:43,198
Someone had bewitched it.

1491
02:12:44,153 --> 02:12:45,248
What was it like?

1492
02:12:46,573 --> 02:12:48,279
- What was he like?
- Who?

1493
02:12:48,364 --> 02:12:49,616
The Dark Lord.

1494
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:55,020
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1495
02:12:56,833 --> 02:12:57,738
I don't know.

1496
02:13:01,503 --> 02:13:03,947
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1497
02:13:07,393 --> 02:13:08,741
...into one of my nightmares.

1498
02:13:28,018 --> 02:13:29,029
Were there others?

1499
02:13:29,825 --> 02:13:31,299
In the graveyard, were there others?

1500
02:13:36,043 --> 02:13:36,948
I...

1501
02:13:37,964 --> 02:13:41,581
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1502
02:13:49,497 --> 02:13:52,246
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1503
02:13:57,325 --> 02:13:59,737
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1504
02:13:59,822 --> 02:14:01,281
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1505
02:14:05,854 --> 02:14:09,681
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1506
02:14:09,766 --> 02:14:11,456
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1507
02:14:13,737 --> 02:14:15,819
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1508
02:14:16,813 --> 02:14:19,238
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1509
02:14:19,323 --> 02:14:20,736
...that led him straight to it?

1510
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:31,289
It was you from the beginning.

1511
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:34,037
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1512
02:14:34,603 --> 02:14:37,564
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1513
02:14:38,433 --> 02:14:40,563
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1514
02:14:41,233 --> 02:14:44,613
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1515
02:14:44,903 --> 02:14:46,205
And now the deed is done.

1516
02:14:47,748 --> 02:14:51,263
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1517
02:15:00,523 --> 02:15:04,391
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1518
02:15:05,046 --> 02:15:06,899
...that I have once and for all...

1519
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:12,390
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1520
02:15:12,475 --> 02:15:13,685
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1521
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:19,655
Severus.

1522
02:15:22,314 --> 02:15:23,749
That's it, take it.

1523
02:15:25,935 --> 02:15:27,037
Do you know who I am?

1524
02:15:27,857 --> 02:15:29,352
Albus Dumbledore.

1525
02:15:29,437 --> 02:15:32,143
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1526
02:15:32,453 --> 02:15:35,374
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1527
02:15:38,402 --> 02:15:39,546
Harry, away from there!

1528
02:16:01,103 --> 02:16:02,415
You all right, Alastor?

1529
02:16:02,998 --> 02:16:04,467
I'm sorry, Albus.

1530
02:16:05,319 --> 02:16:06,688
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1531
02:16:09,273 --> 02:16:10,440
Polyjuice Potion.

1532
02:16:10,525 --> 02:16:13,019
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1533
02:16:13,957 --> 02:16:15,306
We'll get you up in a minute.

1534
02:16:50,268 --> 02:16:51,190
Harry!

1535
02:16:55,308 --> 02:16:57,169
Barty Crouch Junior.

1536
02:16:57,786 --> 02:17:00,231
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

1537
02:17:03,203 --> 02:17:04,436
Your arm, Harry.

1538
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:10,467
You know what this means, don't you?

1539
02:17:11,796 --> 02:17:12,846
He's back.

1540
02:17:14,423 --> 02:17:16,411
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1541
02:17:17,513 --> 02:17:19,195
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1542
02:17:20,053 --> 02:17:21,487
Send an owl to Azkaban.

1543
02:17:22,174 --> 02:17:23,791
I think they'll find they're
missing a prisoner.

1544
02:17:24,913 --> 02:17:27,733
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1545
02:17:28,103 --> 02:17:30,366
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1546
02:17:50,730 --> 02:17:53,104
Today, we acknowledge...

1547
02:17:54,167 --> 02:17:56,113
...a really terrible loss.

1548
02:17:59,133 --> 02:18:01,407
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1549
02:18:01,986 --> 02:18:03,804
...exceptionally hard-working...

1550
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:07,190
...infinitely fair-minded...

1551
02:18:08,130 --> 02:18:09,871
...and, most importantly...

1552
02:18:10,813 --> 02:18:14,723
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1553
02:18:16,523 --> 02:18:20,264
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1554
02:18:23,953 --> 02:18:24,909
You see...

1555
02:18:26,333 --> 02:18:28,203
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1556
02:18:29,224 --> 02:18:30,713
...by Lord Voldemort!

1557
02:18:33,213 --> 02:18:36,079
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1558
02:18:37,423 --> 02:18:40,355
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1559
02:18:43,223 --> 02:18:44,295
Now, the pain...

1560
02:18:45,110 --> 02:18:48,534
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1561
02:18:48,763 --> 02:18:49,929
...and reminds us...

1562
02:18:50,483 --> 02:18:54,129
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1563
02:18:54,353 --> 02:18:57,162
...our hearts beat as one.

1564
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,621
In light of recent events...

1565
02:19:00,653 --> 02:19:02,715
...the bonds of friendship
we've made this year

1566
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:05,345
will be more important than ever.

1567
02:19:06,453 --> 02:19:10,842
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1568
02:19:12,203 --> 02:19:13,818
You remember that...

1569
02:19:14,963 --> 02:19:17,399
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1570
02:19:18,474 --> 02:19:20,425
...kind and honest and...

1571
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:25,259
...brave and true, right to the very end.

1572
02:19:51,158 --> 02:19:52,758
I never liked these curtains.

1573
02:19:53,914 --> 02:19:55,937
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1574
02:19:56,892 --> 02:19:58,115
By accident, of course.

1575
02:20:04,473 --> 02:20:07,027
I put you in terrible
danger this year, Harry.

1576
02:20:07,473 --> 02:20:08,340
I'm sorry.

1577
02:20:12,157 --> 02:20:13,053
Professor...

1578
02:20:14,143 --> 02:20:16,578
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1579
02:20:17,882 --> 02:20:22,159
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1580
02:20:23,797 --> 02:20:25,621
<i>Priori Incantatem.</i>

1581
02:20:30,413 --> 02:20:32,374
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1582
02:20:33,703 --> 02:20:34,729
They reappeared.

1583
02:20:36,908 --> 02:20:40,022
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1584
02:20:43,343 --> 02:20:45,305
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1585
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:50,549
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1586
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,503
But remember this:

1587
02:20:56,473 --> 02:20:57,710
You have friends here.

1588
02:21:00,324 --> 02:21:01,296
You're not alone.

1589
02:21:22,745 --> 02:21:23,617
Hermione.

1590
02:21:24,955 --> 02:21:26,375
This is for you.

1591
02:21:27,542 --> 02:21:29,339
Write to me. Promise.

1592
02:21:30,772 --> 02:21:31,675
Bye.

1593
02:21:38,595 --> 02:21:39,673
<i>Au revoir</i>, Ron.

1594
02:22:24,393 --> 02:22:27,004
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1595
02:22:27,089 --> 02:22:28,199
- No.
- No.

1596
02:22:28,403 --> 02:22:29,577
No, I didn't think so.

1597
02:22:29,819 --> 02:22:32,146
Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1598
02:22:37,203 --> 02:22:39,275
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1599
02:22:47,333 --> 02:22:48,227
Yes.

1600
02:22:53,553 --> 02:22:56,771
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1601
02:22:56,856 --> 02:22:58,962
I won't. You know I won't.

1602
02:23:00,853 --> 02:23:03,697
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
