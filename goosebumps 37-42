THE HEADLESS GHOST 

Goosebumps - 37

Stephanie Alpert and I haunt our neighborhood. 

We got the idea last Halloween. 

There are a lot of kids in our neighborhood, and we like to haunt them and 
give them a little scare. 

Sometimes we sneak out late at night in masks and stare into kids’ 
windows. Sometimes we leave rubber hands and rubber fingers on windowsills. 
Sometimes we hide disgusting things in mailboxes. 

Sometimes Stephanie and I duck down behind bushes or trees and make the 
most frightening sounds—animal howls and ghostly moans. Stephanie can do a 
terrifying werewolf howl. And I can toss back my head and shriek loud enough 
to shake the leaves on the trees. 

We keep almost all the kids on our block pretty frightened. 

In the mornings, we catch them peeking out their doors, seeing if it’s safe to 
come out. And at night, most of them are afraid to leave their houses alone. 

Stephanie and I are really proud of that. 

During the day we are just Stephanie Alpert and Duane Comack, two 
normal twelve-year-olds. But at night, we become the Twin Terrors of Wheeler 
Falls. 

No one knows. No one. 

Look at us, and you see two sixth graders at Wheeler Middle School. Both 
of us have brown eyes and brown hair. Both of us are tall and thin. Stephanie is a 
few inches taller because she has higher hair. 

Some people see us hanging out together and think we’re brother and sister. 
But we’re not. We don’t have any brothers and sisters, and we don’t mind one 
bit. 

We live across the street from one another. We walk to school together in 
the morning. We usually trade lunches, even though our parents both pack us 
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. 

We’re normal. Totally normal. 

Except for our secret late-night hobby. 

How did we become the Twin Terrors? Well, it’s sort of a long story.... 



Last Halloween was a cool, clear night. A full moon floated over the bare trees. 

I was standing outside Stephanie’s front window in my scary Grim Reaper 
costume. I stood up on tiptoes, trying to peek inside to check out her costume. 

“Hey—beat it, Duane! No looking!” she shouted through the closed 
window. Then she pulled down the shade. 

“I wasn’t looking. I was just stretching!” I shouted back. 

I was eager to see what Stephanie was going to be. Every Halloween, she 
comes up with something awesome. The year before, she came waddling out 
inside a huge ball of green toilet paper. You guessed it. She was an iceberg 
lettuce. 

But this year I thought maybe I had her beat. 

I’d worked really hard on my Grim Reaper costume. I wore high platform 
shoes—so high that I’d tower over Stephanie. My black, hooded cape swung 
along the ground. I hid my curly brown hair under a tight rubber skullcap. And I 
smeared my face with sick-looking makeup, the color you see on moldy bread. 

My dad didn’t want to look at me. He said I turned his stomach. 

A success! 

I couldn’t wait to make Stephanie sick! I banged my Grim Reaper sickle on 
Stephanie’s window. “Hey, Steph—hurry up!” I called. “I’m getting hungry. I 
want candy!” 

I waited and waited. I started pacing back and forth across her front lawn, 
my long cape sweeping over the grass and dead leaves. 

“Hey! Where are you?” I called again. 

No Stephanie. 

With an impatient groan, I turned back to the house. 

And a huge, hairy animal jumped me from behind and chewed off my head. 



2 


Well, it didn’t really chew off my head. 

But it tried to. 

It growled and tried to sink its gleaming fangs into my throat. 

I staggered back. The creature looked like an enormous black cat, covered 
in thick, black bristles. Gobs of yellow goo poured from its hairy ears and black 
nose. Its long, pointed fangs glowed in the dark. 

The creature snarled again and shot out a hairy paw. “Candy... give me all 
your candy!” 

“Stephanie—?” I choked out. It was Stephanie. Wasn’t it? 

The creature jabbed its claws into my stomach in reply. That’s when I 
recognized Stephanie’s Mickey Mouse watch on its hairy wrist. 

“Wow. Stephanie, you look awesome! You really—” I didn’t finish. 
Stephanie ducked behind the hedge and yanked me down beside her. 

My knees hit the sidewalk hard. “Ow! Are you crazy?” I shrieked. “What’s 
the big idea?” 

A group of little kids in costumes paraded by. Stephanie leapt out of the 
hedge. “Arrrggghhh!” she growled. 

The little kids totally freaked. They turned and started to run. Three of them 
dropped their trick-or-treat bags. Stephanie scooped up the bags. “Yummmm!” 

“Whoa! You really scared them,” I said, watching the little kids run up the 
street. “That was cool.” 

Stephanie started to laugh. She has a high, silly laugh that always starts me 
laughing, too. It sounds like a chicken being tickled. “That was kind of fun,” she 
replied. “More fun than trick-or-treating.” 

So we spent the rest of the night scaring kids. 

We didn’t get much candy. But we had a great time. 

“I wish we could do this every night!” I exclaimed as we walked home. 

“We can,” Stephanie said, grinning. “It doesn’t have to be Halloween to 
scare kids, Duane. Get my meaning?” 

I got her meaning. 

She tossed back her bristly head and let out her chicken laugh. And I 
laughed, too. 



And that’s how Stephanie and I started haunting our neighborhood. Late at 
night, the Twin Terrors strike, up and down our neighborhood. We’re 
everywhere! 

Well... almost everywhere. 

There’s one place in our neighborhood that even Stephanie and I are afraid 
of. 

It’s an old stone house on the next block. It’s called Hill House. I guess 
that’s because it sits up on a high hill on Hill Street. 

I know. I know. A lot of towns have a haunted house. 

But Hill House really is haunted. 

Stephanie and I know that for sure. 

Because that’s where we met the Headless Ghost.

Hill House is the biggest tourist attraction in Wheeler Falls. Actually, it’s the 
only one. 

Maybe you’ve heard of Hill House. It’s written up in a lot of books. 

Tour guides in creepy black uniforms give the Hill House tour every hour. 
The guides will act real scary and tell frightening stories about the house. Some 
of the ghost stories give me cold shivers. 

Stephanie and I love to take the tour—especially with Otto. Otto is our 
favorite guide. 

Otto is big and bald and scary-looking. He has tiny black eyes that seem to 
stare right through you. And he has a booming voice that comes from deep 
inside his huge chest. 

Sometimes when Otto leads us from room to room in the old house, he 
lowers his voice to a whisper. He talks so low, we can barely hear him. Then his 
tiny eyes will bulge. He’ll point—and scream: “There’s the ghost! There!” 

Stephanie and I always scream. 

Even Otto’s smile is scary. 

Stephanie and I have taken the Hill House tour so often, we could probably 
be tour guides. We know all the creepy old rooms. All the places where ghosts 
have been spotted. 

Real ghosts! 

It’s the kind of place we love. 

Do you want to know the story of Hill House? Well, here’s the story that 
Otto, Edna, and the other guides tell: 

Hill House is two hundred years old. And it’s been haunted practically from the 
day the stones were gathered to build it. 

A young sea captain built the house for his new bride. But the day the big 
house was finished, the captain was called out to sea. 

His young wife moved into the huge house all alone. It was cold and dark, 
and the rooms and hallways seemed to stretch on forever. 

For months and months, she stared out of their bedroom window. The 
window that faced the river. Waiting patiently for the captain’s return. 



Winter passed. Then spring, then summer. 

But he never came back. 

The captain was lost at sea. 

One year after the sea captain disappeared, a ghost appeared in the halls of 
Hill House. The ghost of the young sea captain. He had come back from the 
dead, back to find his wife. 

Every night he floated through the long, twisting halls. He carried a lantern 
and called out his wife’s name. “Annabel! Annabel!” 

But Annabel never answered. 

In her grief, she had fled from the old house. She never wanted to see it 
again. 

Another family had moved in. As the years passed, many people heard the 
ghost’s nightly calls. “Annabel! Annabel!” Through the twisting halls and cold 
rooms of the house. 

“Annabel! Annabel!” 

People heard the sad, frightening calls. But no one ever saw the ghost. 

Then, one hundred years ago, a family named Craw bought the house. The 
Craws had a thirteen-year-old boy named Andrew. 

Andrew was a nasty, mean-natured boy. He delighted in playing cruel tricks 
on the servants. He scared them out of their wits. 

He once threw a cat out of a window. He was disappointed when it 
survived. 

Even Andrew’s own parents couldn’t stand to spend time with the mean- 
tempered boy. He spent his days on his own, exploring the old mansion, looking 
for trouble he could get into. 

One day he discovered a room he had never explored before. He pushed 
open the heavy wooden door. It let out a loud creak. 

Then he stepped inside. 

A lantern glowed dimly on a small table. The boy saw no other furniture in 
the large room. No one at the table. 

“How strange,” he thought. “Why should I find a burning lantern in an 
empty room?” 

Andrew approached the lantern. As he leaned down to lower the wick, the 
ghost appeared. 

The sea captain! 

Over the years, the ghost had grown into an old and terrifying creature. He 



had long, white fingernails that curled in spirals. Cracked, black teeth poked out 
from between swollen, dry lips. And a scraggly white beard hid the ghost’s face 
from view. 

The boy stared in horror. “Who—who are you?” he stammered. 

The ghost didn’t utter a word. He floated in the yellow lantern light, glaring 
hard at the boy. 

“Who are you? What do you want? Why are you here?” the boy demanded. 

When the ghost still didn’t reply, Andrew turned—and tried to run. 

But before he moved two steps, he felt the ghost’s cold breath on his neck. 

Andrew grabbed for the door. But the old ghost swirled around him, swirled 
darkly, a swirl of black smoke in the dim yellow fight. 

“No! Stop!” the boy screamed. “Let me go!” 

The ghost’s mouth gaped open, revealing a bottomless black hole. Finally, it 
spoke—in a whisper that sounded like the scratch of dead leaves. “Now that you 
have seen me, you cannot leave.” 

“No!” The boy shrieked. “Let me go! Let me go!” 

The ghost ignored the boy’s cries. He repeated his dry, cold words: “Now 
that you have seen me, you cannot leave.” 

The old ghost raised his hands to the boy’s head. His icy fingers spread over 
Andrew’s face. The hands tightened. Tightened. 

Do you know what happened next?

The ghost pulled off the boy’s head—and hid it somewhere in the house! 

After hiding the head, hiding it away in the huge, dark mansion, the ghost 
of the sea captain let out a final howl that made the heavy stone walls tremble. 

The terrifying howl ended with the cry, “Annabel! Annabel!” 

Then the old ghost disappeared forever. 

But Hill House was not freed from ghosts. A new ghost now haunted the 
endless, twisting halls. 

From then on, Andrew haunted Hill House. Every night the ghost of the 
poor boy searched the halls and rooms, looking for his missing head. 

All through the house, say Otto and the other tour guides, you can hear the 
footsteps of the Headless Ghost, searching, always searching. 

And each room of the house now has a terrifying story of its own. 

Are the stories true? 

Well, Stephanie and I believe them. That’s why we take the tour so often. 

We must have explored the old place at least a hundred times. 

Hill House is such awesome fun. 

At least it was fun—until Stephanie had another one of her bright ideas. 

After Stephanie’s bright idea, Hill House wasn’t fun anymore. 

Hill House became a truly scary place.

The trouble started a few weeks ago when Stephanie suddenly got bored. 

It was about ten o’clock at night. We were out haunting the neighborhood. 
We did our terrifying wolf howl outside Geena Jeffers’ window. Then we went 
next door to Terri Abel’s house. We put some chicken bones in her mailbox— 
just because it’s creepy to reach in your mailbox and feel bones. 

Then we crept across the street to Ben Fuller’s house. 

Ben was our last stop for the night. Ben is a kid in our class, and we have a 
special scare for him. 

You see, he’s afraid of bugs, which makes him really easy to scare. 

Even though it’s pretty cold out, he sleeps with his bedroom window open. 
So Stephanie and I like to step up to his window and toss rubber spiders onto 
Ben as he sleeps. 

The rubber spiders tickle his face. He wakes up. And starts to scream. 

Every time. 

He always thinks the spiders are real. 

He screams and tries to scramble out of bed. He gets all tangled in his 
covers and thuds onto the floor. 

Then Stephanie and I congratulate each other on a job well done. And we 
go home to bed. 

But tonight, as we tossed the rubber spiders at Ben’s sleeping face, 
Stephanie turned to me and whispered, “I just had a great idea.” 

“Huh?” I started to reply. But Ben’s scream interrupted me. 

We listened to him scream, then thud to the floor. 

Stephanie and I slapped each other a high five. Then we took off, running 
across the dark backyards, our sneakers thumping the hard, nearly-frozen 
ground. 

We stopped in front of the split oak tree in my front yard. The tree trunk is 
completely split in two. But Dad doesn’t have the heart to have the tree taken 
away. 

“What is your great idea?” I asked Stephanie breathlessly. 

Her dark eyes flashed. “I’ve been thinking. Every time we go out to haunt 
the neighborhood, we scare the same old kids. It’s starting to get boring.” 



I wasn’t bored. But I knew that once Stephanie gets an idea, there’s no 
stopping her. “So, do you want to find some new kids to scare?” I asked. 

“No. Not new kids. Something else.” She began to walk around the tree. 
Circling it. “We need a new challenge.” 

“Like what?” I asked. 

“Our scares are all kid stuff,” she complained. “We make some spooky 
sounds, toss a few things inside an open window—and everyone is frightened to 
death. It’s too easy.” 

“Yeah,” I agreed. “But it’s funny.” 

She ignored me. She stuck her head through the split in the tree trunk. 
“Duane, what’s the scariest place in Wheeler Falls?” 

That was easy. “Hill House, of course,” I answered. 

“Right. And what makes it so scary?” 

“All the ghost stories. But especially the one about the boy searching for his 
head.” 

“Yes!” Stephanie cried. All I could see now was her head, poking through 
the split oak tree. “The Headless Ghost!” she cried in a deep voice, and let out a 
long, scary laugh. 

“What’s your problem?” I demanded. “Are you trying to haunt me now?” 

Her head seemed to float in the darkness. “We need to haunt Hill House,” 
she declared in a whisper.

“Excuse me?” I cried. “Stephanie, what are you talking about?” 

“We’ll take the Hill House tour and sneak off on our own,” Stephanie 
replied thoughtfully. 

I shook my head. “Give me a break. Why would we do that?” 

Stephanie’s face seemed to glow, floating by itself in the tree trunk. “We’ll 
sneak off on our own—to search for the ghost’s head.” 

I stared back at her. “You’re kidding, right?” 

I walked behind the tree and tugged her away from it. The floating head 
trick was starting to give me the creeps. 

“No, Duane, I’m not kidding,” she replied, shoving me away. “We need a 
challenge. We need something new. Prowling around the neighborhood, 
terrifying everyone we know—that’s just kid stuff. Bor-ring.” 

“But you don’t believe the story about the missing head—do you?” I 
protested. “It’s just a ghost story. We can search and search. But there is no head. 
It’s all a story they made up for the tourists.” 

Stephanie narrowed her eyes at me. “I think you’re scared, Duane.” 

“Huh? Me?” My voice got pretty shrill. 

A cloud rolled over the moon, making my front yard even darker. A chill 
ran down my back. I pulled my jacket around me tighter. 

“I’m not afraid to sneak off from the tour and search Hill House on our 
own,” I told Stephanie. “I just think it’s a big waste of time.” 

“Duane, you’re shivering,” she teased. “Shivering with fright.” 

“I am not!” I screamed. “Come on. Let’s go to Hill House. Right now. I’ll 
show you.” 

A grin spread over Stephanie’s face. She tossed back her head and let out a 
long howl. A victory howl. “This is going to be the coolest thing the Twin 
Terrors have ever done!” she cried, slapping me a high five that made my hand 
sting. 

She dragged me up Hill Street. The whole way there, I didn’t say one word. 
Was I afraid? 

Maybe a little. 

We climbed the steep, weed-choked hill and stood before the front steps of 



Hill House. The old house looked even bigger at night. Three stories tall. With 
turrets and balconies and dozens of windows, all dark and shuttered. 

All the houses in our neighborhood are brick or clapboard. Hill House is the 
only one made out of stone slabs. Dark gray slabs. 

I always have to hold my breath when I stand close to Hill House. The 
stone is covered with a blanket of thick green moss. Two hundred years of it. 
Putrid, moldy moss that doesn’t exactly smell like a flower garden. 

I peered up. Up at the round turret that stretched to the purple sky. A 
gargoyle, carved in stone, perched at the very top. It grinned down at us, as if 
challenging us to go inside. 

My knees suddenly felt weak. 

The house stood in total darkness, except for a single candle over the front 
doorway. But the tours were still going on. The last tour left at ten-thirty every 
night. The guides said the late tours were the best—the best time to see a ghost. 

I read the sign etched in stone beside the door. ENTER HILL HOUSE— 
AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE CHANGED. FOREVER. 

I’d read that sign a hundred times. I always thought it was funny—in a 
corny sort of way. 

But tonight it gave me the creeps. 

Tonight was going to be different. 

“Come on,” Stephanie said, pulling me by the hand. “We’re just in time for 
the next tour.” 

The candle flickered. The heavy wooden door swung open. By itself. I 
don’t know how, but it always does that. 

“Well, are you coming or not?” Stephanie demanded, stepping into the dark 
entryway. 

“Coming,” I gulped. 



7 


Otto met us as we stepped inside the door. Otto always reminds me of an 
enormous dolphin. He has a big, smooth bald head. And he’s sort of shaped like 
a dolphin. He must weigh about three hundred pounds! 

Otto was dressed entirely in black, as always. Black shirt. Black pants. 
Black socks. Black shoes. And gloves—you guessed it—black. It’s the uniform 
that all the tour guides wear. 

“Look who’s here!” he called. “Stephanie and Duane!” He broke out into a 
wide grin. His tiny eyes flashed in the candlelight. 

“Our favorite guide!” Stephanie greeted him. “Are we in time for the next 
tour?” 

We pushed through the turnstile without paying. We’re such regulars at Hill 
House that they don’t even charge us anymore. 

“About five minutes, guys,” Otto told us. “You two are out late tonight, 
huh?” 

“Yeah... well,” Stephanie hesitated. “It’s more fun to take the tour at night. 
Isn’t it, Duane?” She jabbed my side. 

“You can say that again,” I mumbled. 

We moved into the front hall with some others who were waiting for the 
tour to begin. Teenagers mostly, out on dates. 

The front hall is bigger than my living room and dining room put together. 
And except for the winding staircase in the center, it’s completely bare. No 
furniture at all. 

Shadows tossed across the floor. I gazed around the room. No electric 
lights. Small torches were hung from the peeling, cracked walls. The orange 
torchlight flickered and bent. 

In the dancing light, I counted the people around me. Nine of them. 
Stephanie and I were the only kids. 

Otto lighted a lantern and crossed to the front of the hall. He held it up high 
and cleared his throat. 

Stephanie and I grinned at each other. Otto always starts the tour the same 
way. He thinks the lantern adds atmosphere. 

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he boomed. “Welcome to Hill House. We hope 



you will survive your tour tonight.” Then he gave a low, evil laugh. 

Stephanie and I mouthed Otto’s next words along with him: 

“In 1795, a prosperous sea captain, William P. Bell, built himself a home on 
the highest hill in Wheeler Falls. It was the finest home ever built here at the 
time—three stories high, nine fireplaces, and over thirty rooms. 

“Captain Bell spared no expense. Why? Because he hoped to retire here and 
finish his days in splendor with his young and beautiful wife. But it was not to 
be.” 

Otto cackled, and so did Stephanie and I. We knew every move Otto had. 

Otto went on. “Captain Bell died at sea in a terrible shipwreck—before he 
ever had a chance to live in his beautiful house. His young bride, Annabel, fled 
the house in horror and sorrow.” 

Now Otto’s voice dropped. “But soon after Annabel left, strange things 
began to happen in Hill House.” 

This was Otto’s cue to start walking toward the winding stairs. The old, 
wooden staircase is narrow and creaky. When Otto starts to climb, the stairs 
groan and grumble beneath him as if in pain. 

Keeping silent, we followed Otto up the stairs to the first floor. Stephanie 
and I love this part, because Otto doesn’t say a word the whole time. He just 
huffs along in the darkness while everyone tries to keep up with him. 

He starts talking again when he reaches Captain Bell’s bedroom. A big, 
wood-paneled room with a fireplace and a view of the river. 

“Soon after Captain Bell’s widow ran away,” Otto reported, “people in 
Wheeler Falls began reporting strange sightings. Sightings of a man who 
resembled Captain Bell. He was always seen here, standing by his window, 
holding his lantern aloft.” 

Otto moved to the window and raised his lantern. “On a windless night, if 
you listened carefully, you could sometimes hear him calling out her name in a 
low, mournful voice.” 

Otto took a deep breath, then called softly: “Annabel. Annabel. Annabel...” 

Otto swung the lantern back and forth for effect. By now, he had everyone’s 
complete attention. 

“But of course, there’s more,” he whispered.

As we followed him through the upstairs rooms, Otto told us how Captain Bell 
haunted the house for about a hundred years. “People who moved into Hill 
House tried all kinds of ways to get rid of the ghost. But it was determined to 
stay.” 

Then Otto told everyone about the boy finding the ghost and getting his 
head pulled off. “The ghost of the sea captain vanished. The headless ghost of 
the boy continued to haunt the house. But that wasn’t the end of it.” 

Into the long, dark hallway now. Torches darting and flickering along the 
walls. “Tragedy continued to haunt Hill House,” Otto continued. “Shortly after 
young Andrew Craw’s death, his twelve-year-old sister Hannah went mad. Let’s 
go to her room next.” 

He led us down the hall to Hannah’s room. 

Stephanie loves Hannah’s room. Hannah collected porcelain dolls. And she 
had hundreds of them. All with the same long yellow hair, painted rosy cheeks, 
and blue-tinted eyelids. 

“After her brother was killed, Hannah went crazy,” Otto told us all in a 
hushed voice. “All day long, for eighty years, she sat in her rocking chair over 
there in the corner. And she played with her dolls. She never left her room. 
Ever.” 

He pointed to a worn rocking chair. “Hannah died there. An old lady 
surrounded by her dolls.” 

The floorboards creaked under him as Otto crossed the room. Setting the 
lantern down, he lowered his big body into the rocking chair. 

The chair made a cracking sound. I always think Otto is going to crush it! 
He started to rock. Slowly. The chair groaned with each move. We all watched 
him in silence. 

“Some people swear that poor Hannah is still here,” he said softly. “They 
say they’ve seen a young girl sitting in this chair, combing a doll’s hair.” 

He rocked slowly, letting the idea sink in. “And—then we come to the story 
of Hannah’s mother.” 

With a grunt, Otto pulled himself to his feet. He grabbed up the lantern and 
made his way to the top of the long, dark stairway at the end of the hall. 



“Soon after her son’s tragedy, the mother met her own terrible fate. She was 
on her way down these stairs one night when she tripped and fell to her death.” 

Otto gazed down the stairs and shook his head sadly. 

He does this every time. As I said, Stephanie and I know his every move. 

But we hadn’t come here tonight to watch Otto perform. I knew that sooner 
or later, Stephanie would want to get going. So I started glancing around. To see 
if it was a good time for us to sneak away from the others. 

And that’s when I saw the strange kid. Watching us. 

I didn’t see him when we first came in. In fact, I’m sure he wasn’t there 
when the tour started. I had counted nine people. No kids. 

The boy was about our age, with wavy blond hair and pale skin. Very pale 
skin. He was wearing black jeans and a black turtleneck that made his face look 
even whiter. 

I edged over to Stephanie. She was hanging back from the group. 

“You ready?” she whispered. 

Otto had started back down the stairs. If we were going to sneak away from 
the tour, now was the time. 

But I could see that weird kid still staring at us. 

Staring hard. 

He was giving me the creeps. 

“We can’t go. Someone’s watching us,” I whispered to Stephanie. 

“Who?” 

“That weird kid over there.” I motioned with my eyes. 

He was still staring at us. He didn’t even try to be polite and turn away 
when we caught him. 

Why was he watching us like that? What was his problem ? 

Something told me we should wait. Something told me not to hide from the 
others just yet. 

But Stephanie had other ideas. “Forget him,” she said. “He’s nobody.” She 
grabbed my arm—and tugged. “Let’s go!” 

We pressed against the cold wall of the hallway and watched the others 
follow Otto down the stairs. 

I held my breath until I heard the last footsteps leave the stairway. We were 
alone now. Alone in the long, dark hall. 

I turned to Stephanie. I could barely see her face. “Now what?” I asked.

“Now we do some exploring on our own!” Stephanie declared, rubbing her 
hands together. “This is so exciting!” 

I gazed down the long hallway. I didn’t feel real excited. I felt kind of 
scared. 

I heard a low groan from a room across the hall. The ceiling creaked above 
our heads. The wind rattled the windows in the room we had just come from. 

“Steph—are you sure—?” I started. 

But she was already hurrying down the hall, walking on tiptoes to keep the 
floors from squeaking. “Come on, Duane. Let’s search for the ghost’s head,” she 
whispered back to me, her dark hair flying behind her. “Who knows? We might 
find it.” 

“Yeah. Sure.” I rolled my eyes. 

I didn’t think the chances were too good. How do you find a hundred-year- 
old head? And what if you do find it? 

Yuck! 

What would it look like? Just a skull? 

I followed Stephanie down the hall. But I really didn’t want to be there. I 
like haunting the neighborhood and scaring other people. 

I don’t like scaring myself! 

Stephanie led the way into a bedroom we had seen on other tours. It was 
called the Green Room. Because the wallpaper was decorated with green vines. 
Tangle after tangle of green vines. Up and down the walls and across the ceiling, 
too. 

How could anyone sleep in here? I wondered. It was like being trapped in a 
thick jungle. 

We both stopped inside the doorway and stared at the tangles of vines on all 
sides of us. Stephanie and I call the Green Room by another name. The 
Scratching Room. 

Otto once told us that something terrible happened here sixty years ago. 
The two guests who stayed in the room woke up with a disgusting purple rash. 

The rash started on their hands and arms. It spread to their faces. Then it 
spread over their entire bodies. 



Big purple sores that itched like crazy. 

Doctors from all around the world were called to study the rash. They 
couldn’t figure out what it was. And they couldn’t figure out how to cure it. 

Something in the Green Room caused the rash. 

But no one ever figured out what it was. 

That’s the story Otto and the other guides tell. It might be true. All the 
weird, scary stories Otto tells might be true. Who knows? 

“Come on, Duane!” Stephanie prodded. “Let’s look for the head. We don’t 
have much time before Otto sees that we’re missing.” 

She trotted across the room and dove under the bed. 

“Steph—please!” I started. I stepped carefully over to the low, wooden 
dresser in the corner. 

“We’re not going to find a ghost’s head in here. Let’s go,” I pleaded. 

She couldn’t hear me. She had climbed under the bed. 

“Steph—?” 

After a few seconds, she backed out. As she turned toward me, I saw that 
her face was bright red. 

“Duane!” she cried. “I... I...” 

Her dark eyes bulged. Her mouth dropped open in horror. She grabbed the 
sides of her face. 

“What is it? What’s wrong?” I cried, stumbling across the room toward her. 

“Ohhh, it itches! It itches so badly!” Stephanie wailed. 

I started to cry out. But my voice got caught in my throat. 

Stephanie began to rub her face. She frantically rubbed her cheeks, her 
forehead, her chin. 

“Owwww. It itches! It really itches!” She started to scratch her scalp with 
both hands. 

I grabbed her arm and tried to pull her up from the floor. “The rash! Let’s 
get you home!” I cried. “Come on! Your parents will get the doctor! And... 
and...” 

I stopped when I saw that she was laughing. 

I dropped her arm and stepped back. 

She stood up, straightening her hair. “Duane, you jerk,” she muttered. “Are 
you going to fall for every dumb joke tonight?” 

“No way!” I replied angrily. “I just thought—” 

She gave me a shove. “You’re too easy to scare. How could you fall for 



such a stupid joke?” 

I shoved her back. “Just don’t pull any more dumb jokes, okay?” I snarled. 
“I mean it, Stephanie. I don’t think it’s funny. I really don’t. I’m not going to fall 
for any more stupid jokes. So don’t even try.” 

She wasn’t listening to me. She was staring over my shoulder. Staring in 
open-mouthed shock. 

“Oh, I d-don’t believe it!” she stammered. “There it is! There’s the head!” 



10 


I fell for it again. 

I couldn’t help myself. 

I let out a shrill scream. 

I spun around so hard, I nearly knocked myself over. I followed Stephanie’s 
finger. I squinted hard in the direction she pointed. 

She was pointing to a gray clump of dust. 

“Sucker! Sucker!” She slapped me on the back and started to giggle. 

I uttered a low growl and balled my hands into tight fists. But I didn’t say 
anything. I could feel my face burning. I knew that I was blushing. 

“You’re too easy to scare, Duane,” Stephanie teased again. “Admit it.” 

“Let’s just get back to the tour,” I grumbled. 

“No way, Duane. This is fun. Let’s try the next room. Come on.” 

When she saw that I wasn’t following her, she said, “I won’t scare you like 
that anymore. Promise.” 

I saw that her fingers were crossed. But I followed her anyway. 

What choice did I have? 

We crept through the narrow hall that connected us to the next room. And 
found ourselves in Andrew’s room. Poor, headless Andrew. 

It still had all his old stuff in it. Games and toys from a hundred years ago. 
An old-fashioned wooden bicycle leaning against one wall. 

Everything just the way it was. Before Andrew met up with the sea 
captain’s ghost. 

A lantern on the dresser cast blue shadows on the walls. I didn’t know if I 
believed the ghost story or not. But something told me that if Andrew’s head 
were anywhere, we’d find it here. In his room. 

Under his old-fashioned-looking canopy bed. Or hidden under his dusty, 
faded toys. 

Stephanie tiptoed over to the toys. She bent down and started to move 
things aside. Little wooden bowling pins. An old-fashioned board game, the 
colors all faded to brown. A set of metal toy soldiers. 

“Check around the bed, Duane,” she whispered. 



I started across the room. “Steph, we shouldn’t be touching this stuff. You 
know the tour guides never let us touch anything.” 

Stephanie set down an old wooden top. “Do you want to find the head or 
not?” 

“You really think there’s a ghost’s head hidden in this house?” 

“Duane, that’s what we’re here to find out—right?” 

I sighed and stepped over to the bed. I could see there was no use arguing 
with Stephanie tonight. 

I ducked my head under the purple canopy and studied the bed. A boy 
actually slept in this bed, I told myself. 

Andrew actually slept under this quilt. A hundred years ago. 

The thought gave me a chill. 

I tried to picture a boy about my age sleeping in this heavy, old bed. 

“Go ahead. Check out the bed,” Stephanie instructed from across the room. 

I leaned over and patted the gray and brown patchwork quilt. It felt cold 
and smooth. 

I punched the pillows. They felt soft and feathery. Nothing hidden inside 
the pillow cases. 

I was about to test the mattress when the quilt began to move. 

It rustled over the sheets. A soft, scratchy sound. 

Then, as I stared in horror, the gray and brown quilt began to slide down the 

bed. 

There was no one in the bed. No one! 

But someone was pushing the quilt down, down to the bottom of the bed. 



11 


I swallowed a scream. 

“You’ve got to move faster, Duane,” Stephanie said. 

I turned and saw her standing at the end of the bed. Holding the bottom of 
the quilt in both hands. 

“We don’t have all night!” she declared. She pulled the quilt down farther. 
“Nothing in the bed. Come on. Let’s move on.” 

A sigh escaped my lips. Stephanie had tugged down the quilt and scared me 
again. 

No ghost in the bed. No ghost pushing down the covers to climb out and 
grab me. 

Only Stephanie. 

At least this time she hadn’t seen how frightened I was. 

We worked together to pull the quilt back into place. She smiled at me. 
“This is kind of fun,” she said. 

“For sure,” I agreed. I hoped she couldn’t see that I was still shaking. “It’s a 
lot more fun than tossing rubber spiders into Ben Fuller’s bedroom window.” 

“I like being in this house so late at night. I like sneaking off from the 
group. I can feel a ghost lurking nearby,” Stephanie whispered. 

“You c-can?” I stammered, glancing quickly around the room. 

My eyes stopped at the bottom of the door to the hallway. 

There it sat. On the floor. Wedged between the door and the wall. Half- 
hidden in deep shadow. 

The head. 

This time, I saw the head. 

Not a joke. Not a cruel trick. 

Through the gray-black shadows, I saw the round skull. And I saw the two 
black eye sockets. Empty eye sockets. Two dark holes in the skull. 

Staring up at me. 

Staring. 

I grabbed Stephanie’s arm. I started to point. 

But there was no need. 



Stephanie saw it, too. 



12 


I was the first to move. I took a step toward the door. Then another. 

I heard sharp gasps. Someone breathing hard. Close behind me. 

It took me a few seconds to realize it was Stephanie. 

Keeping my eyes on the head, I made my way into the dark corner. My 
heart started to pound as I bent down and reached for it with both hands. 

The black eye sockets stared up at me. Round, sad eyes. 

My hands trembled. 

I started to scoop it up. 

But it slipped out of my hands. And started to roll away. 

Stephanie let out a cry as the head rolled over the floor toward her. 

In the orange light from the lantern, I saw her frightened expression. I saw 
that she was frozen there. 

The head rolled over the floor and bumped against her sneaker. It came to a 
stop inches in front of her. 

The empty black eye sockets stared up at her. 

“Duane—” she called, staring down at it, hands pressed against her cheeks. 
“I didn’t think—I didn’t really think we’d find it. I—I—” 

I hurried back across the room. It’s my turn to be the brave one, I decided. 
My turn to show Stephanie that I’m not a wimp who’s afraid of every shadow. 
My turn to show Stephanie. 

I scooped up the ghost’s head in both hands. I raised it in front of Stephanie. 
Then I moved toward the lantern on the dressertop. 

The head felt hard. Smoother than I thought. 

The eye sockets were deep. 

Stephanie stayed close by my side. Together we made our way into the 
orange lantern light. 

I let out a groan when I realized I wasn’t carrying a ghost’s head. 

Stephanie groaned too when she saw what I held in my hands. 



13 


A bowling ball. 

I was carrying an old wooden bowling ball, the pale wood cracked and 
chipped. 

“I don’t believe it,” Stephanie murmured, slapping her forehead. 

My eyes went to the wooden bowling pins, lying among Andrew’s old toys. 
“This must be the ball that went with those pins,” I said softly. 

Stephanie grabbed it from me and turned it between her hands. “But it only 
has two holes.” 

I nodded. “Yeah. In those days, bowling balls only had two holes. My dad 
told me about it one day when we went bowling. Dad never could figure out 
what they did with their thumb.” 

Stephanie stuck her fingers into the two holes. The “eye sockets”. She 
shook her head. I could see she was really disappointed. 

We could hear Otto’s voice, booming from somewhere downstairs. 

Stephanie sighed. “Maybe we should go down and rejoin the tour,” she 
suggested. She rolled the ball back to the pile of toys. 

“No way!” I exclaimed. 

I liked being the brave one for a change. I didn’t want to quit while I was 
ahead. 

“It’s getting kind of late,” Stephanie said. “And we’re not going to find any 
ghost head up here.” 

“That’s because we’ve already explored these rooms a hundred times,” I 
told her. “I think we should find a room we’ve never explored before.” 

She scrunched up her face, thinking hard. “Duane, do you mean—?” 

“I mean, the ghost head is probably hidden in a room the tour doesn’t go 
through. Maybe upstairs. You know. On the top floor.” 

Stephanie’s eyes grew wide. “You want to sneak up to the top floor?” 

I nodded. “Why not? That’s probably where all the ghosts hang out— 
right?” 

She studied me, her eyes searching mine. I knew she was surprised by my 
brave idea. 

Of course, I didn’t feel very brave at all. I just wanted to impress her. I just 



wanted to be the brave one for a change. 

I was hoping that she’d say no. I was hoping she’d say, “Let’s go back 
downstairs, Duane.” 

But instead, an excited grin spread over her face. And she said, “Okay. Let’s 
do it!” 



14 


So I was stuck being the brave one. 

We both had to be brave now. The Twin Terrors, on their way up the dark, 
creaking stairway that led to the third floor. 

A sign beside the stairs read: NO VISITORS. 

We stepped right past it and began climbing the narrow staircase. Side by 

side. 

I couldn’t hear Otto’s voice anymore. Now I could only hear the creak and 
squeak of the steps beneath our sneakers. And the steady thud thud thud of my 
heart. 

The air grew hot and damp as we reached the top. I squinted down a long, 
dark hallway. There were no lanterns. No candles. 

The only light came from the window at the end of the hall. Pale light from 
outside that cast everything in an eerie, ghostly blue. 

“Let’s start in the first room,” Stephanie suggested, whispering. She 
brushed her dark hair off her face. 

It was so hot up here, I had sweat running down my forehead. I mopped it 
up with my jacket sleeve and followed Stephanie to the first room on the right. 

The heavy wooden door was half open. We slid in through the opening. 
Pale blue light washed in through the dust-caked windows. 

I waited for my eyes to adjust. Then I squinted around the large room. 

Empty. Completely empty. No furniture. No sign of life. 

Or ghosts. 

“Steph—look.” I pointed to a narrow door against the far wall. “Let’s check 
it out.” 

We crept across the bare floor. Through the dusty window, I glimpsed the 
full moon, high over the bare trees now. 

The doorway led to another room. Smaller and even warmer. A steam 
radiator clanked against one wall. Two old-fashioned-looking couches stood 
facing each other in the center of the room. No other furniture. 

“Let’s keep moving,” Stephanie whispered. 

Another narrow door led to another dark room. “The rooms up here are all 
connected,” I murmured. I sneezed. Sneezed again. 



“Ssshhh. Quiet, Duane,” Stephanie scolded. “The ghosts will hear us 
coming.” 

“I can’t help it,” I protested. “It’s so dusty up here.” 

We were in some kind of sewing room. An old sewing machine stood on a 
table in front of the window. A carton at my feet was filled with balls of black 
yarn. 

I bent down and pawed quickly through the balls of yarn. No head hidden 
in there. 

We stepped into the next room before we realized it was completely dark. 

The window was partly shuttered. Only a tiny square of gray light crept 
through from outside. 

“I-I can’t see anything,” Stephanie declared. I felt her hand grasp my arm. 
“It’s too dark. Let’s get out of here, Duane.” 

I started to reply. But a loud thump made my breath catch in my throat. 

Stephanie’s hand squeezed my hand. “Duane, did you make that thump?” 

Another thump. Closer to us. 

“No. Not m-me,” I stammered. 

Another thump on the floor. 

“We’re not alone in here,” Stephanie whispered. 

I took a deep breath. “Who is it?” I called. “Who’s there?” 



15 


“Who’s there?” I choked out. 

Stephanie squeezed my arm so hard, it hurt. But I made no attempt to move 
away from her. 

I heard soft footsteps. Ghostly footsteps. 

A cold chill froze the back of my neck. I clamped my jaw shut to keep my 
teeth from chattering. 

And then yellow eyes floated toward us through the thick darkness. 

Four yellow eyes. 

The creature had four eyes! 

A gurgling sound escaped my throat. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move. 

I stared straight ahead. Listening. 

Watching. 

The eyes floated apart in pairs. Two eyes moved to the right, two to the left. 

“Noooo!” I cried out when I saw more eyes. 

Yellow eyes in the corners of the room. Evil eyes glinting at us from against 
the wall. 

Yellow eyes all along the floor. 

Yellow eyes all around us. 

Catlike yellow eyes glaring in silence at Stephanie and me as we huddled 
together in the center of the room. 

Catlike eyes. 

Cat’s eyes. 

Because the room was filled with cats. 

A shrill yowl gave them away. A long meeeeyoww from the windowsill 
made Stephanie and me both sigh in relief. 

A cat brushed against my leg. Startled, I jumped aside, bumping into 
Stephanie. 

She bumped me back. 

More cats meowed. Another cat brushed the back of my jeans leg. 

“I-I think these cats are lonely,” Stephanie stammered. “Do you think 
anyone ever comes up here?” 



“I don’t care,” I snapped. “All these yellow eyes floating around. I 
thought... I thought... well... I don’t know what I thought! It’s creepy. Let’s get 
out of here.” 

For once, Stephanie didn’t argue. 

She led the way to the door at the back of the room. All around us, cats 
were howling and yowling. 

Another one brushed my leg. 

Stephanie tripped over a cat. In the darkness, I saw her fall. She landed on 
her knees with a hard thud. 

The cats all began to screech. 

“Are you okay?” I cried, hurrying to help pull her up. 

The cats were howling so loud, I couldn’t hear her reply. 

We jogged to the door, pulled it open, and escaped. 

I closed the door behind us. Silence now. “Where are we?” I whispered. 

“I-I don’t know,” Stephanie stammered, keeping close to the wall. 

I moved to a tall, narrow window and peered through the dusty glass. The 
window led out to a small balcony. The balcony jutted out from the gray 
shingled roof. 

Pale white moonlight washed in through the window. 

I turned back to Stephanie. “We’re in some kind of back hallway,” I 
guessed. The long, narrow hallway seemed to stretch on forever. “Maybe these 
rooms are used by the workers. You know. Manny, the night watchman. The 
house cleaners. And the tour guides.” 

Stephanie sighed. She stared down the long hallway. “Let’s go downstairs 
and find Otto and the tour group. I think we’ve done enough exploring for 
tonight.” 

I agreed. “There must be stairs at the end of this hall. Let’s go.” 

I took four or five steps. Then I felt the ghostly hands. 

They brushed over my face. My neck. My body. 

Sticky, dry, invisible hands. 

The hands pushed me back as they clung to my skin. 

“Ohhhh, help!” Stephanie moaned. 

The ghosts had her in their grasp, too. 



16 


The ghost’s filmy hands brushed over me. I could feel the soft fingers—dry and 
soft as air—tighten around my skin. 

Stephanie’s hands thrashed wildly. Beside me in the dark hall, she struggled 
to free herself. 

“It-it’s like a net!” she choked out. 

I swiped at my face. My hair. 

I spun away. But the dry fingers clung to me. Tightening. Tightening. 

And I realized we hadn’t walked into a ghost’s grasp. 

Tugging and tearing frantically with both hands, I realized we had walked 
into cobwebs. 

A thick curtain of cobwebs. 

The blanket of sticky threads had fallen over us like a fisherman’s net. The 
more we struggled, the tighter it wrapped itself around us. 

“Stephanie—it’s cobwebs !” I cried. I tugged a thick, stringy wad of them 
off my face. 

“Of course it’s cobwebs!” she shot back, squirming and thrashing. “What 
did you think it was?” 

“Uh... a ghost,” I muttered. 

Stephanie snickered. “Duane, I know you have a good imagination. But if 
you start seeing ghosts everywhere, we’ll never get out of here.” 

“I... I... I...” I didn’t know what to say. 

Stephanie thought the same thing I did. She thought she’d been grabbed by 
a ghost. But now she was pretending she knew all along. 

We stood there in the darkness, tearing the sticky threads off our faces and 
arms and bodies. I let out an angry groan. I couldn’t brush the stuff from my 
hair! 

“I’m going to itch forever !” I wailed. 

“I’ve got more bad news for you,” Stephanie murmured. 

I pulled a thick wad off my ear. “Huh?” 

“Who do you think made these cobwebs?” 

I didn’t have to think about it. “Spiders?” 



My arms and legs started to tingle. My back began to itch. I felt a light 
tingling on the back of my neck. 

Were there spiders crawling up and down my body? Hundreds and 
hundreds of them? 

Forgetting the wispy strings of cobweb, I started to run. Stephanie had the 
same idea. We both ran down the long hall, scratching and slapping at ourselves. 

“Steph—the next time you have a great idea, don’t have a great idea!” I 
warned her. 

“Let’s just get out of here!” she groaned. 

We reached the end of the hall, still scratching as we ran. 

No stairway. 

How do we get back downstairs? 

Another hall twisted to the left. Low candles over the doorways flickered 
and danced. Shadows darted over the worn carpet like slithering animals. 

“Come on.” I pulled Stephanie’s arm. We had no choice. We had to follow 
this hallway, too. 

We jogged side by side. The rooms were ah dark and silent. 

The candle flames dipped as we ran past. Our long shadows ran ahead of 
us, as if eager to get downstairs first. 

I stopped when I heard someone laughing. 

“Whoa,” Stephanie murmured, breathing hard. Her dark eyes grew wide. 

We both listened hard. 

I heard voices. Inside the room at the end of the hall. 

The door was closed. I couldn’t make out the words. I heard a man say 
something. A woman laughed. Other people laughed. 

“We caught up to the tour,” I whispered. 

Stephanie scrunched up her face. “But the tour never comes up here to the 
top floor,” she protested. 

We stepped up close to the door and listened again. 

More laughter on the other side. A lot of people talking cheerfully, all at the 
same time. It sounded like a party. 

I pressed my ear against the door. “I think the tour ended, and everyone is 
just chatting,” I whispered. 

Stephanie scratched the back of her neck. She pulled a stringy gob of 
cobweb from her hair. “Well, hurry, Duane. Open the door. Let’s join them,” she 
urged. 



“I hope Otto doesn’t ask us where we’ve been,” I replied. 
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed open the door. 
Stephanie and I took a step inside. 

And gasped in shock at what we saw. 



17 


The room stood empty. 

Empty, silent, and dark. 

“What happened? Where is everyone?” Stephanie cried. 

We took another step into the dark room. The floor creaked beneath us. The 
only sound. 

“I don’t get it,” Stephanie whispered. “Didn’t we just hear voices in here?” 
“Lots,” I said. “They were laughing and talking. It really sounded like a 
party.” 

“A big party,” Stephanie added, her eyes darting around the empty room. 
“Tons of people.” 

A cold chill ran down the back of my neck. “I don’t think we heard people,” 
I whispered. 

Stephanie turned to me. “Huh?” 

“They weren’t people,” I croaked. “They were ghosts.” 

Her mouth dropped open. “And they all disappeared when we opened the 
door?” 

I nodded. “I—I think I can still feel them in here. I can feel their presence.” 
Stephanie let out a frightened squeak. “Feel them? What do you mean?” 

At that moment, a cold wind came whooshing through the room. It rushed 
over me, cold and dry. And it chilled me down to my toes. 

Stephanie must have felt it, too. She wrapped her arms around her chest. 
“Brrr! Do you feel that breeze? Is the window open? How come it got so cold in 
here all of a sudden?” she asked. 

She shivered again. Her voice became tiny. “We’re not alone in here, are 

we?” 

“I don’t think so,” I whispered. “I think we just crashed someone’s party.” 
Stephanie and I stood there, feeling the cold of the room. I didn’t dare 
move. Maybe a ghost stood right beside me. Maybe the ghosts we heard were all 
around us, staring at us, preparing to swoop over us. 

“Stephanie,” I whispered. “What if we really have crashed their party? 
What if we’ve invaded the ghosts’ quarters?” 

Stephanie swallowed hard. She didn’t reply. 



Hadn’t Andrew, the ghost boy, lost his head when he stumbled into the 
ghost’s living quarters? Were we standing in the same living quarters? The same 
room where Andrew found the ghost of the old sea captain? 

“Stephanie, I think we should get out of here,” I said softly. “Now.” 

I wanted to run. I wanted to fly down the stairs. Fly out of Hill House. Fly 
to my safe, warm home where there were no ghosts. 

No ghosts. 

We spun around and bolted for the door. 

Were the ghosts going to try to stop us? 

No. We made it back into the flickering orange light of the hallway. I pulled 
the door shut behind us. 

“The stairs. Where are the stairs?” Stephanie cried. 

We stood at the end of the hall. Facing a solid wall. The flowers on the 
wallpaper appeared to open and close, moving in the darting candlelight. 

I banged both fists against the wall. “How do we get out of here? How?” 

Stephanie had already pulled open a door across the hall. I followed her 
inside. 

“Oh, no!” Ghostly figures filled the room. It took me a few seconds to 
realize that I was staring at sheets pulled over furniture. Chairs and couches 
covered with sheets. 

“M-maybe this is the ghosts’ living room,” I stammered. 

Stephanie didn’t hear me. She had already burst through the open door 
against the far wall. 

I followed her into another room, cluttered with large crates. The crates 
were piled nearly to the ceiling. 

Another room. Then another. 

My heart began to pound. My throat ached. 

I felt so discouraged. Were we ever going to find our way to the stairs? 

Another door. Another dark, empty room. 

“Hey, Steph—” I whispered. “I think we’re going in circles.” 

Out into a long, twisting hallway. More candles. More flowers flickering 
darkly on the wallpaper. 

We ran side by side down the hall. Until we came to a door I hadn’t seen 
before. A door with a horseshoe nailed onto it. 

Maybe it meant that our luck was about to change. I sure hoped so! 

I grabbed the knob with a trembling hand. I pulled open the door. 



A staircase! 

“Yes!” I cried. 

“Finally!” Stephanie gasped. 

“This must be the servants’ staircase,” I guessed. “Maybe we’ve been in the 
servants’ quarters all this time.” 

The stairway was blanketed in darkness. The stairs looked steep. 

I took a step down, holding onto the wall. Then another step. 

Stephanie had one hand on my shoulder. When I stepped down, she stepped 
down, too. 

Another step. Another. The soft thuds of our sneakers echoed in the deep 
stairwell. 

We had taken about ten steps when I heard footsteps. 

Someone coming up the stairs. 



18 


Stephanie bumped me hard. I shot out both hands. Grabbed the wall to keep 
from falling down the stairs. 

No time to turn and run. 

The footsteps grew louder. And heavier. Light from a flashlight swept over 
Stephanie, then me. 

Squinting against the light, I saw a dark figure climbing up to us. “So there 
you are!” his voice boomed, echoing in the stairwell. 

A familiar voice. 

“Otto!” Stephanie and I both cried. 

He bounced up in front of us, moving the flashlight from her face to mine. 
“What are you two doing up here?” he demanded breathlessly. 

“Uh... we got lost,” I answered quickly. 

“We got separated from the tour,” Stephanie added. “We tried to find you.” 

“Yes. We tried,” I chimed in. “We were searching everywhere. But we 
couldn’t catch up to the group.” 

Otto lowered the flashlight. I could see his tiny dark eyes narrowing at us. I 
don’t think he believed our story. 

“I thought you two knew my tour by heart,” he said, rubbing his chin. 

“We do,” Stephanie insisted. “We just got turned around. We got lost. And 
we—” 

“But how did you get up here on the top floor?” Otto demanded. 

“Well...” I started. But I couldn’t think of a good answer. I turned back to 
Stephanie on the step above me. 

“We heard voices up here. We thought it was you,” she told Otto. 

It wasn’t exactly a lie. We did hear voices. 

Otto lowered the beam of light to the stairs. “Well, let’s get back 
downstairs. No one is allowed on this floor. It’s private.” 

“Sorry,” Stephanie and I murmured. 

“Watch your step, kids,” Otto warned. “These back stairs are very steep and 
rickety. I’ll lead you back to the group. Edna took over for me while I went to 
find you.” 



Edna was our second-favorite tour guide. She was old and white-haired. 
Very pale and frail-looking, especially in her black tour-guide outfit. 

But she was a great storyteller. With her quivering, old voice, she really 
made you believe every frightening story she told. 

Stephanie and I eagerly clumped down the stairs, following Otto. His 
flashlight swept in front of us as he led us out onto the second floor. We followed 
a long hallway. A hallway I knew very well. 

We stopped outside Joseph Craw’s study. Joseph was Andrew’s father. I 
peeked inside. A bright fire blazed in the fireplace. 

Edna stood beside the fireplace, telling the tragic story of Joseph Craw to 
the tour group. 

Stephanie and I had heard the sad story a hundred times. A year after 
Andrew had his head cut off, Joseph came home late one winter night. He took 
off his coat, then moved to the fireplace to warm himself. 

No one knows how Joseph was burned up. At least, that’s how Otto, Edna, 
and the other guides tell the story. Was he pushed into the fireplace? Did he fall 
in? 

One guess is as good as another. 

But when the maid came into the study the next morning, she found a 
horrifying sight. 

She found two charred, blackened hands gripping the mantel. 

Two hands, holding on tightly to the marble mantelpiece. 

All that was left of Joseph Craw. 

It’s a yucky story—isn’t it? 

It gives me a chill every time I hear it. 

As Otto led us to the study, Edna was just getting to the sickening part. The 
ending. “Do you want to rejoin the group?” Otto whispered. 

“It’s pretty late. I think we’d better get home,” Stephanie told him. 

I quickly agreed. “Thanks for rescuing us. We’ll catch the tour again soon.” 

“Good night,” Otto said, clicking off his flashlight. “You know the way 
out.” He hurried into the study. 

I started to leave. But stopped when I saw the boy again, the pale boy with 
the wavy blond hair. The boy in the black jeans and black turtleneck. 

He stood away from the tour group. Close to the door. And he was staring 
at Stephanie and me again. Staring hard at us, a cold expression on his face. 

“Come on,” I whispered, grabbing Stephanie’s arm. I tugged her away from 



the study door. 

We quickly found the front stairway. A few seconds later, we pushed open 
the front door and stepped outside. A cold wind greeted us as we started down 
the hill. Wisps of black cloud floated like snakes over the moon. 

“Well, that was fun!” Stephanie declared. She zipped her coat to her chin. 

“Fun?” I wasn’t so sure. “It was kind of scary.” 

Stephanie grinned at me. “But we weren’t afraid—right?” 

I shivered. “Right.” 

“I’d like to go back and explore some more,” she said. “You know. Maybe 
go back to that room with all the voices. Find some real ghosts.” 

“Yeah. Great,” I agreed. I didn’t feel like arguing with her. I felt pretty tired. 

She pulled a wool muffler from her coat pocket. As she swung it around her 
neck, one end caught in a low pine bush. 

“Hey—!” she cried out. 

I moved to the bush and started to pull the muffler free. 

And that’s when I heard the voice. 

Just a whisper. A whisper from the other side of the bush. 

But I heard it very clearly. 

“Did you find my head ? ” 

That’s what I heard. 

“Did you find my head? Did you find it for me?” 



19 


I uttered a startled gasp and stared into the bush. “Stephanie—did you hear 
that?” I choked out. 

No reply. 

“Stephanie? Steph?” 

I spun around. She was staring at me, her mouth open in surprise. 

“Did you hear that whisper?” I asked again. 

Then I realized she wasn’t staring at me. She was staring past me. 

I turned—and saw the strange, blond boy standing there beside the pine 
bush. “Hey—did you just whisper to us?” I demanded sharply. 

He narrowed his pale gray eyes at me. “Huh? Me?” 

“Yeah. You,” I snapped. “Were you trying to scare us?” 

He shook his head. “No way.” 

“You didn’t whisper from behind this bush?” I asked again. 

“I just got out here,” the boy insisted. 

We saw him in Joseph Craw’s study less than a minute ago, I told myself. 
How did he get out here so fast? 

“Why did you follow us?” Stephanie demanded, shoving her muffler 
around her coat collar. 

The boy shrugged. 

“Why were you staring at us?” I asked, stepping up close to Stephanie. 

The wind howled over the hilltop. The row of pine bushes shook in the 
gusty wind, as if shivering. Thin black clouds continued to snake their way over 
the pale moon. 

The boy wore no coat. Only the black turtleneck and black jeans. The wind 
fluttered his long, wavy hair. 

“We saw you staring at us,” Stephanie repeated. “How come?” 

He shrugged again. He kept his strange, gray eyes down at the ground. “I 
saw you sneak away,” he said. “I wondered if... if you saw anything 
interesting.” 

“We got lost,” I told him, glancing at Stephanie. “We didn’t see much.” 

“What’s your name?” Stephanie asked. 



“Seth,” he replied. 

We told him our names. 

“Do you live in Wheeler Falls?” Stephanie asked. 

He shook his head. He kept his eyes down at his shoes. “No. I’m just 
visiting.” 

Why wouldn’t he look us in the eye? Was he just shy? 

“Are you sure you didn’t whisper something from behind that bush?” I 
asked again. 

He shook his head. “No way. Maybe someone was playing a joke on you.” 

“Maybe,” I said. I stepped closer and kicked the bush. I don’t know what I 
expected. 

But nothing happened. 

“You and Stephanie went exploring on your own?” Seth asked. 

“Yeah. A little,” I confessed. “We’re kind of into ghosts.” 

When I said that, he jerked his head up. He raised his gray eyes and gazed 
hard at Stephanie, then at me. 

His face had been a blank. No life to it. No expression at all. 

But now I could see that he was really excited. 

“Do you want to see some real ghosts?” he asked us, staring hard. “Do 


you?” 



20 


Seth stared at us as if challenging us. “Do you two want to see some real 
ghosts?” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Stephanie replied, returning his stare. 

“What do you mean, Seth?” I demanded. “Have you ever seen a ghost?” 

He nodded. “Yeah. In there.” He pointed with his head, back to the big 
stone house. 

“Huh?” I cried. “You saw a real ghost in Hill House? When?” 

“Duane and I have taken the tour a hundred times,” Stephanie told him. 
“We’ve never seen any ghost in there.” 

He snickered. “Of course not. Do you think the ghosts come out when the 
tour groups are in there? They wait till the house closes. They wait until all the 
tourists go home.” 

“How do you know?” I asked. 

“I sneaked in,” Seth replied. “Late one night.” 

“You what?” I cried. “How?” 

“I found a door around back. It was unlocked. I guess everyone forgot about 
it,” Seth explained. “I sneaked in after the house was closed. And I—” 

He stopped suddenly. His eyes were on the house. 

I turned and saw the front door open. People stepped out, fastening their 
coats. The last tour had ended. People were heading for home. 

“Over here!” Seth whispered. 

We followed him behind the pine bushes and ducked down low. The people 
walked past us. They were laughing and talking about the house and all the ghost 
stories. 

When they were down the hill, we stood up again. Seth brushed his long 
hair off his forehead. But the wind blew it right back. 

“I sneaked in late at night, when the house was dark,” he repeated. 

“Your parents let you go out so late at night?” I asked. 

A strange smile crossed his lips. “They didn’t know,” he said softly. The 
smile faded. “Your parents let you two out?” 

Stephanie laughed. “Our parents don’t know, either.” 



“Good,” Seth replied. 

“And you really saw a ghost?” I asked. 

He nodded. Brushed his hair back again. “I crept past Manny, the night 
watchman. He was sound asleep. Snoring away. I made my way to the front of 
the house. I was standing at the bottom of the big staircase—when I heard a 
laugh.” 

I gulped. “A laugh?” 

“From the top of the stairs. I backed up against the wall. And I saw the 
ghost. A very old lady. In a long dress and a black bonnet. She wore a heavy 
black veil over the front of her face. But I could see her eyes through the veil. I 
could see them because they glowed bright red—like fire!” 

“Wow!” Stephanie cried. “What did she do?” 

Seth turned to the house. The front door had closed. The lantern over the 
door had been put out. The house stood in total darkness. 

“The old ghost came sliding down the banister,” he reported. “She tossed 
back her head—and screamed all the way down. And as she slid, her red eyes 
left a bright trail, like the tail of a comet.” 

“Weren’t you scared?” I asked Seth. “Didn’t you try to run away?” 

“There was no time,” he replied. “She came sliding down the banister, right 
toward me. Eyes blazing. Screaming like some kind of crazed animal. I was 
pressed against the wall. I couldn’t move. And when she reached the bottom, I 
thought she’d grab me. But she vanished. Disappeared into the darkness. And all 
that was left was the faint red glow, floating in the air. The glow of her eyes.” 

“Oh, wow!” Stephanie cried. 

“That’s awesomel” I agreed. 

“I want to sneak back in again,” Seth declared, watching the house. “I’ll bet 
there are more ghosts in there. I really want to see them.” 

“Me, too!” Stephanie cried eagerly. 

Seth smiled at her. “So you’ll come with me? Tomorrow night? I don’t want 
to go back alone. It’ll be so much more fun if you come, too.” 

The wind swirled sharply. The black clouds rolled over the moon, covering 
it, shutting out its light. The old house appeared to grow darker on its hilltop 
perch. 

“So you’ll come with me tomorrow night?” Seth asked again. 

“Yeah. Great!” Stephanie told him. “I can’t wait. How about you, Duane?” 
She turned to me. “You’ll come, too—won’t you, Duane? Won’t you?” 



21 


I said yes. 

I said I couldn’t wait to see a real ghost. 

I said I was shivering because of the cold wind. Not because I was scared. 

We made a plan to meet at midnight tomorrow at the back of Hill House. 
Then Seth hurried away. And Stephanie and I walked home. 

The street was dark and empty. Most of the house lights were out. Far in the 
distance, a dog howled. 

Stephanie and I walked quickly, leaning into the wind. We usually didn’t 
stay out this late. 

Tomorrow night, we’d be even later. 

“I don’t trust that guy,” I told Stephanie as we reached her front yard. “He’s 
too weird.” 

I expected her to agree. But she said, “You’re just jealous, Duane.” 

“Huh? Me? Jealous?” I couldn’t believe she said that. “Why would I be 
jealous?” 

“Because Seth is so brave. Because he saw a ghost and we didn’t.” 

I shook my head. “Do you believe that crazy story about a ghost sliding 
down the banister? I think he made it up.” 

“Well,” Stephanie replied thoughtfully, “we’ll find out tomorrow night— 
won’t we!” 

Tomorrow night came too quickly. 

I had a math test in the afternoon. I don’t think I did too well on it. I 
couldn’t stop thinking about Seth, and Hill House, and ghosts. 

After dinner, Mom cornered me in the living room. She brushed back my 
hair and studied my face. “Why do you look so tired?” she asked. “You have 
dark circles around your eyes.” 

“Maybe I’m part raccoon,” I replied. That’s what I always say when she 
tells me I have circles around my eyes. 

“I think you should go to bed early tonight,” Dad chimed in. Dad always 
thinks that everyone should go to bed early. 

So I went to my room at nine-thirty. But of course I didn’t go to sleep. 



I read a book and listened to a tape on my Walkman. And waited for Mom 
and Dad to go to bed. And watched the clock. 

Mom and Dad are very heavy sleepers. You can pound and pound on their 
bedroom door, and they don’t wake up. They once slept through a hurricane. 
That’s the truth. They didn’t hear the tree that fell onto our house! 

Stephanie’s parents are heavy sleepers, too. That’s why it’s so easy for the 
two of us to sneak out of our bedroom windows. That’s why it’s so easy for us to 
haunt our neighborhood at night. 

As the clock neared midnight, I wished we were going out on one of our 
usual haunting trips. I wished we were going to hide under Chrissy Jacob’s 
window and howl like wolves. And then toss rubber spiders into Ben Fuller’s 
bed. 

But Stephanie had decided that was too boring. 

We needed excitement. We needed to go ghost hunting. With a strange kid 
we’d never seen before. 

At ten to twelve, I pulled on my down coat and crept out of my bedroom 
window. Another cold, windy night. I felt sprinkles of frozen rain on my 
forehead. Sol pulled up my hood. 

Stephanie was waiting for me at the bottom of her driveway. She had pulled 
her brown hair back in a ponytail. Her coat was open. She wore a heavy ski 
sweater underneath, pulled down over her jeans. 

She raised her head and let out a ghostly howl. “Owooooooo!” 

I clapped my hand over her open mouth. “You’ll wake up the whole block!” 

She laughed and backed away from me. “I’m a little excited. Aren’t you?” 
She opened her mouth in another howl. 

The frozen rain pattered the ground. We hurried toward Hill House. The 
swirling wind scattered twigs and dead leaves as we walked. Most of the house 
lights had been turned off. 

A car rolled by slowly as we turned onto Hill Street. Stephanie and I ducked 
behind a hedge. The driver might wonder why two kids were wandering around 
Wheeler Falls at midnight. 

I wondered, too. 

We waited for the car to disappear. Then we continued our journey. 

Our sneakers crunched over the hard ground as we climbed the hill that led 
to the old haunted house. Hill House rose above us, like a silent monster waiting 
to swallow us up. 



The last tour had ended. The lights were all off. Otto and Edna and the other 
tour guides were probably all home by now. 

“Come on, Duane. Hurry,” Stephanie urged. She started to run around the 
side of the house. “Seth is probably waiting.” 

“Wait up!” I cried. We followed a narrow dirt path around to the back. 

Squinting into the darkness, I searched for Seth. No sign of him. 

The backyard was cluttered with equipment of all kinds. A row of rusted 
metal trashcans formed a fence along one wall. A long wooden ladder lay on its 
side in the tall weeds. Wooden cartons and barrels and cardboard boxes were 
strewn everywhere. A hand lawnmower tilted against the house. 

“It—it’s so much darker back here,” Stephanie stammered. “Do you see 
Seth?” 

“I can’t see anything ,” I replied in a whisper. “Maybe he changed his mind. 
Maybe he isn’t coming.” 

Stephanie started to reply. But a choked cry from the side of the house made 
us both jump. 

I turned to see Seth stagger into view. 

His blond hair was wild, flying around his face. His eyes bulged. His hands 
gripped his throat. 

“The ghost!” he cried, stumbling clumsily. “The ghost—he—he got me!” 

Then Seth collapsed at our feet and didn’t move. 



22 


“Nice try, Seth,” I said calmly. 

“Nice fall,” Stephanie added. 

He raised his head slowly, staring up at us. “I didn’t fool you?” 

“No way,” I replied. 

Stephanie rolled her eyes. “That’s Joke Number One,” she told Seth. 
“Duane and I have pulled that one a thousand times.” 

Seth climbed to his feet and brushed off the front of his black turtleneck. He 
scowled, disappointed. “Just trying to give you a little scare.” 

“You’ll have to do better than that,” I told him. 

“Duane and I are experts at giving scares,” Stephanie added. “It’s sort of 
our hobby.” 

Seth straightened his hair with both hands. “You two are weird,” he 
murmured. 

I brushed cold raindrops off my eyebrows. “Can we get inside?” I asked 
impatiently. 

Seth led the way to the narrow door at the far side of the house. “Did you 
two have any trouble sneaking out?” he asked, whispering. 

“No. No trouble,” Stephanie told him. 

“Neither did I,” he replied. He stepped up to the door and lifted the wooden 
latch. “I took the tour again tonight,” he whispered. “Otto showed me some new 
things. Some new rooms we can explore.” 

“Great!” Stephanie exclaimed. “Do you promise we’ll see a real ghost?” 
Seth turned back to her. A strange smile spread over his face. “Promise,” he 

said. 



23 


Seth gave the door a tug, and it creaked open. 

We slipped inside. Into total blackness. Too dark to see where we were. 

I took a few steps into the room—and bumped into Seth. 

“Ssshhh,” he warned. “Manny the night watchman is posted in the front 
room. He’s probably asleep already. But we’d better stay in back.” 

“Where are we?” I whispered. 

“In one of the back rooms,” Seth whispered. “Wait a few seconds. Our eyes 
will adjust.” 

“Can’t we turn on a light?” I asked. 

“Ghosts won’t come out in the light,” Seth replied. 

We had closed the door behind us. But a cold wind still blew at my back. 

I shivered. 

A soft rattling sound made my breath catch in my throat. 

Was I starting to hear things? 

I pulled off my hood to hear better. 

Silence now. 

“I think I know where I can find some candles,” Seth whispered. “You two 
wait here. Don’t move.” 

“D-don’t worry,” I stammered. I didn’t plan to go anywhere until I could 

see! 

I heard Seth move away, making soft, scraping footsteps over the floor, 
keeping as quiet as he could. His footsteps faded into silence. 

Then I felt another rush of cold wind against the back of my neck. 

“Oh!” I cried out when I heard the rattling again. 

A gentle rattling. Like the rattling of bones. 

Another cold gust of wind swept over me. A ghost’s cold breath, I thought. 
My whole body shook as a chill ran down my back. 

I heard the rattling bones again. Louder. A clattering sound. So close. 

I reached out in the thick blackness. Tried to grab onto a wall. Or a table. Or 
anything. 

But my hands grabbed only air. 



I swallowed hard. Calm down, Duane, I ordered myself. Seth will be back 
in a moment with some candles. Then you’ll see that everything is okay. 

But another jangle and clatter of bones made me gasp. 

“Steph—did you hear that?” I whispered. 

No reply. 

A cold wind tingled my neck. 

The bones rattled again. 

“Steph? Do you hear that noise, too? Steph?” 

No reply. 

“Stephanie? Steph?” I called. 

She was gone. 



24 


Panic time. 

My breaths came short and fast. My heart clattered louder than the skeleton 
bones. My whole body began to shake. 

“Stephanie? Steph? Where are you?” I choked out weakly. 

Then I saw the two yellow eyes moving toward me. Two glowing eyes, 
floating silently, gleaming with evil. Coming nearer. Nearer. 

I froze. 

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t see anything but those two gleaming, yellow 

eyes. 

“Ohh!” I uttered a moan as they floated closer. And I could see them more 
clearly. See that they were candle flames. 

Two candle flames, moving side by side. 

In the soft yellow light, I saw Seth’s face. And Stephanie’s. They each 
carried a lighted candle in front of them. 

“Stephanie—where were you?” I cried in a choked whisper. “I—I thought 

55 

“I went with Seth,” she replied calmly. 

The orange glow from her candle washed over me. I guess Stephanie could 
see how panicked I was. “I’m sorry, Duane,” she said softly. “I said I was going 
with Seth. I thought you heard me.” 

“S-something is rattling,” I stammered. “Bones, I think. I keep feeling a 
cold wind, and I keep hearing—” 

Seth handed me a candle. “Light it,” he instructed. “We’ll look around. See 
what’s rattling.” 

I took the candle and raised it to his. But my hand was shaking so badly, it 
took me five tries to light the wick. Finally, the candle flamed to life. 

I gazed around in the flickering orange light. 

“Hey—we’re in the kitchen,” Stephanie whispered. 

A gust of cold wind blew past me. “Did you feel that?” I cried. 

Seth pointed his candle flame toward the kitchen window. “Look, Duane— 
that window-pane. It’s missing. The cold air is blowing in through the hole.” 

“Oh. Right.” 



Another blast of air. And then the rattling. 

“Did you hear it?” I demanded. 

Stephanie giggled. She pointed to the kitchen wall. In the dim light, I saw 
big pots and pans hanging on the wall. “The wind is making them rattle,” 
Stephanie explained. 

“Ha-ha.” I uttered a feeble laugh. “I knew that. I was just trying to scare 
you,” I lied. “You know. Give you a thrill.” 

I felt like a total jerk. But why should I admit that a bunch of pots on the 
wall nearly had me scared out of my skin? 

“Okay. No more jokes,” Stephanie insisted, turning to Seth. “We want to 
see a real ghost.” 

“Follow me. HI show you something that Otto told me about,” Seth 
whispered. 

Holding his candle in front of him, he led the way across the kitchen to the 
wall beside the stove. He lowered his candle in front of a cabinet door. Then he 
pulled open the cabinet door and moved the candle closer so we could see inside. 

“Why are you showing us a kitchen cabinet?” I demanded. “What’s scary 
about that?” 

“It’s not a cabinet,” Seth replied. “It’s a dumbwaiter. Watch.” He reached 
inside and pulled a rope beside the cabinet shelf. The shelf began to slide up. 

He raised the shelf, then lowered it. “See? This dumbwaiter is like a little 
elevator. It was used to send food from the kitchen to the master bedroom 
upstairs.” 

“You mean for midnight snacks?” I joked. 

Seth nodded. “The cook would put the food on the shelf. Then he would 
pull the rope, and the shelf would carry it upstairs.” 

“Thrills and chills,” I said sarcastically. 

“Yeah. Why are you showing it to us?” Stephanie demanded. 

Seth brought the candle up close to his face. “Otto told me that this 
dumbwaiter is haunted. A hundred and twenty years ago, things suddenly started 
to go wrong with it.” 

Stephanie and I moved closer. I lowered my candle and examined the 
dumbwaiter cabinet. “What went wrong?” I asked. 

“Well,” Seth began softly, “the cook would put food on the shelf and send it 
upstairs. But when the shelf reached the bedroom up there, the food was gone.” 

Stephanie narrowed her eyes at Seth. “It disappeared between the first and 



second floor?” 

Seth nodded solemnly. His gray eyes glowed in the soft candlelight. “This 
happened several times. When the shelf reached the second floor, it was empty. 
The food had vanished.” 

“Wow,” I murmured. 

“The cook became very frightened,” Seth continued. “He was afraid that 
the dumbwaiter had become haunted. He decided to stop using it. And he 
ordered everyone on his staff never to use the dumbwaiter again.” 

“And that’s the end of the story?” I asked. 

Seth shook his head. “And then something horrible happened.” 

Stephanie’s mouth dropped open. “What? What happened?” 

“Some kids were visiting the house. One of them was a boy named Jeremy. 
Jeremy was a real show-off, and very athletic. When he saw the dumbwaiter, he 
decided it would be fun to ride it to the second floor.” 

“Oh, wow,” Stephanie murmured. 

I felt a chill. I thought I could guess what was coming. 

“So Jeremy squeezed onto the shelf. And one of the other kids pulled the 
rope. Suddenly the rope caught. The kid couldn’t get it to move up or down. 
Jeremy was stuck somewhere between the floors. 

“The other kids called up to him, ‘Are you okay?’ But Jeremy didn’t reply. 
They started to get very worried. They tugged and tugged, but they couldn’t 
move the rope. 

“Then suddenly, the shelf came crashing back down.” 

“And was Jeremy on it?” I asked eagerly. 

Seth shook his head. “There were three covered bowls on the shelf. The 
kids lifted the lid off the first bowl. Inside was Jeremy’s heart, still beating. 

“They opened the second bowl. Inside were Jeremy’s eyes, still staring in 
horror. And they opened the third bowl. And saw Jeremy’s teeth, still 
chattering.” 

The three of us stood silent in the orange glow of candlelight. We stared at 
the dumbwaiter shelf. 

I shivered. The pots rattled against the wall. But I was no longer frightened 
by them. I raised my eyes to Seth. “Do you think that story is true?” 

Stephanie laughed. Nervous laughter. “It can’t be true,” she said. 

Seth’s face remained solemn. “Do you believe any of Otto’s stories?” he 
asked me quietly. 



“Well. Yes. No. Some.” I couldn’t decide. 

“Otto swears the story is true,” Seth insisted. “But of course, he may just be 
doing his job. His job is to make this house as scary as possible.” 

“Otto is a great storyteller,” Stephanie murmured. “But enough stories. I 
want to see a real ghost.” 

“Follow me,” Seth replied. His candle flame dipped low as he spun around. 
He led us back through the kitchen, into a long, narrow room at the back. 
“This is the old butler’s pantry,” he announced. “All of the food for the house 
was stored in here.” 

Stephanie and I stepped past him, raising our candles to see the room better. 
When I turned around, Seth was closing the pantry door behind us. 

Then I saw him turn the lock. 

“Hey—what are you doing?” I cried. 

“Why are you locking us in here?” Stephanie demanded. 



25 


I dropped my candle. It bounced on the hard floor, and the flame went out. The 
candle rolled under a shelf. 

When I glanced back up, Stephanie was storming toward Seth. “Seth—what 
are you doing?” she demanded angrily. “Unlock that door. This isn’t funny!” 

I gazed around the long, narrow room. Shelves from floor to ceiling on 
three walls. No windows. No other door to escape through. 

With a sharp cry, Stephanie grabbed for the door handle. But Seth moved 
quickly to block her way. 

“Hey—!” I cried, my heart pounding. I stepped up beside Stephanie. 
“What’s the big idea, Seth?” 

His silvery eyes glowed with excitement behind his candle flame. He stared 
back at us without speaking. The same cold stare I had seen on his face the night 
before. 

Stephanie and I took a step back, huddling close together. 

“Sorry, guys. But I played a little trick on you,” he said finally. 

“Excuse me?” Stephanie cried, more angry than frightened. 

“What kind of trick?” I asked. 

He pushed back his long, blond hair with his free hand. The flickering 
candle sent shadows dancing across his face. “My name isn’t Seth,” he said 
softly, so softly I could barely hear him. 

“But—but—” I stammered. 

“My name is Andrew,” he said. 

Stephanie and I both cried out in surprise. 

“But Andrew is the name of the ghost,” Stephanie protested. “The ghost 
who lost his head.” 

“I am the ghost,” he said softly. A dry laugh escaped his lips. More like a 
cough than a laugh. “I promised you a real ghost tonight. Well... here I am.” 

He blew out the candle. He appeared to vanish with the light. 

“But, Seth—” Stephanie started. 

“Andrew,” he corrected her. “My name is Andrew. My name has been 
Andrew for more than a hundred years.” 

“Let us out of here,” I pleaded. “We won’t tell anyone we saw you. We 



won’t—” 

“I can’t let you go,” he replied in a whisper. 

I remembered the story of the sea captain’s ghost. When Andrew stumbled 
into the sea captain’s room and saw the old ghost, the sea captain had said the 
same thing to him. “Now that you have seen me, I can never let you go. ” 

“You—you lost your head!” I blurted out. 

“So you can’t be Andrew!” Stephanie cried. “You have a head!” 

In the dim light from Stephanie’s candle, I could see the sneer spread over 
Andrew’s face. “No,” he said softly. “No, no, no. I do not have my head. This is 
one that I borrowed.” 

He raised both hands to the sides of his face. “Here. Let me show you,” he 

said. 

Then he pressed his hands against his cheeks and started to tug the head up 
from the black turtleneck. 



26 


“No! Stop!” Stephanie screeched. 

I shut my eyes. I didn’t really want to see him pull off his head. 

When I opened my eyes, Andrew had lowered his hands. 

I gazed once again around the narrow pantry. How could we escape? How 
could we get out of there? The ghost was blocking the only exit. 

“Why did you trick us?” Stephanie asked Andrew. “Why did you bring us 
here? Why did you lie to us?” 

Andrew sighed. “I told you. I borrowed this head.” He ran one hand 
through the hair, then down over the cheek, as if petting it. “I borrowed it. But I 
have to return it.” 

Stephanie and I stared back at him in silence, waiting for him to continue. 
Waiting for him to explain. 

“I saw you last night in the tour group,” he said finally, his eyes locked on 
me. “The others couldn’t see me. But I made myself visible to you.” 

“Why?” I asked in a trembling voice. 

“Because of your head,” he replied. “I liked your head.” 

“Huh?” A frightened gasp escaped my throat. 

He gripped the blond hair again. “I have to return this head, Duane,” he said 
calmly, coldly. “So I’m going to take yours.” 



27 


A frightened giggle escaped my throat. 

Why do people suddenly start laughing when they’re terrified? I guess it’s 
because if you don’t laugh, you’ll scream. Or explode or something. 

Trapped in that small, dark room with a hundred-year-old ghost that wanted 
my head, I felt like laughing, screaming, and exploding all at once! 

I stared hard at Andrew, squinting in the dim light. “You’re kidding, right?” 

He shook his head. His silvery eyes narrowed, hard and cold. “I need your 
head, Duane,” he said softly. He shrugged, as if apologizing. “I’ll pull it off 
quickly. It won’t hurt a bit.” 

“But—but I need it, too!” I sputtered. 

“I’m only going to borrow it,” Andrew said. He took a step toward us. “I’ll 
return it when I find my own head. Promise.” 

“You’re not cheering me up,” I replied. 

He took another step toward us. 

Stephanie and I backed up a step. 

He took a step. We backed up a step. 

We didn’t have much more room to back up. We were nearly to the back 
wall of pantry shelves. 

Suddenly Stephanie spoke up. “Andrew, we’ll find your head!” she offered. 
Her voice shook. 

I turned to her. I’d never seen her scared before. Knowing that Stephanie 
was scared made me even more scared! 

“For sure!” I croaked. “We’ll find your real head. We’ll search all night. We 
know this house really well. I’m sure we can find it if you give us a chance.” 

He stared back at us without replying. 

I wanted to get down on my knees and beg him to give us a chance. 

But I was afraid that if I got down on my knees, he’d pull off my head. 

“We’ll find it, Andrew. I know we will,” Stephanie insisted. 

He shook his head. His borrowed head. “There’s no way,” he murmured 
sadly. “How long have I been searching this house? For more than a hundred 
years. For more than a hundred years, I’ve searched every hallway, every room, 
every closet.” 



He took another step closer. His eyes were locked on my head. I knew he 
was studying it, thinking about how it would look on his shoulders. 

“In all these years, I haven’t found my head,” Andrew continued. “So what 
makes you think you can find it tonight?” 

“Well... uh...” Stephanie turned to me. 

“Uh... maybe we’ll get lucky!” I declared. 

Lame. How lame can you get? 

“Sorry,” Andrew murmured. “I need your head, Duane. We’re wasting 
time.” 

“Give us a chance!” I cried. 

He took a step closer. He was studying my hair now. Probably deciding if 
he should let it grow longer. 

“Andrew—please!” I begged. 

It was no use. His eyes were glassy now. He reached out both hands and 
took another step. 

Stephanie and I backed up. 

“Give me your head, Duane,” the ghost whispered. 

My back bumped a shelf on the wall behind me. 

“I need your head, Duane.” 

Stephanie and I huddled close and pressed our backs against the shelves. 

The ghost floated closer, hands outstretched. 

We pressed ourselves tighter against the shelves. My elbow bumped 
something hard. I heard some heavy objects fall from the shelf. 

“I need your head, Duane.” 

He clenched and unclenched his hands. Two more steps and he’d be close 
enough to grab me. 

“Your head. Give me your head.” 

I jammed my back against the shelves. 

I heard a creaking sound—and the shelf started to slide. 

I stumbled back. And realized that the whole wall was sliding. 

“Wh-what’s happening?” I stammered. 

The ghost reached for my head. “Gotcha!” 



28 


The ghost leaped at me, hands outstretched. 

I ducked—and stumbled back as the wall slid away. 

The wall made a loud grinding sound as it slowly spun around. 

Stephanie fell to the hard floor. 

I pulled her up quickly as Andrew made another wild grab for my head. 

“A tunnel!” I shouted over the grinding of the wall. 

As the wall spun away, it revealed a dark opening. Just big enough to 
squeeze through. 

I pulled Stephanie to the opening—and we squeezed inside. 

We found ourselves in a long, low passageway. Some kind of tunnel. 
Hidden behind the sliding wall. 

I’d always heard about old houses that had secret halls and hidden rooms 
built in them. I never thought I’d be so glad to find one! 

Stephanie and I started to run. Our footsteps echoed loudly on the concrete 

floor. 

We ran past bare, concrete walls, cracked and pitted by time. We had to 
stoop as we ran. The ceiling wasn’t as tall as we were! 

Stephanie slowed down to glance back. “Is he following us?” 

“Just keep running!” I cried. “This tunnel has got to lead out of here! Out of 
this house! It’s got to!” 

“I can’t see where it leads!” she replied breathlessly. 

The low tunnel stretched out in a straight line. I could see only darkness at 
the end. 

Did it stretch on forever? 

If it did, I’d keep running forever. I didn’t plan to stop running until I was 
safely outside. 

And once I was outside, I planned never to visit Hill House again. And I 
planned to stay away from ghosts and to keep my head on my shoulders where it 
belonged. 

Big plans. 

But plans don’t always work out. 



“Ohh!” Stephanie and I both cried out as we nearly crashed into a solid 
concrete wall. 

The tunnel ended. It just ended. 

“It—it doesn’t go anywhere !” I gasped. Breathing hard, I pounded both fists 
against the wall. “Who would build a secret tunnel that leads nowhere?” 

“Push on the wall,” Stephanie cried. “Let’s both push. Maybe this wall will 
slide open, too.” 

We turned and leaned our shoulders into the wall. And pushed. Groaning 
and gasping, I pushed with all my strength. 

I was still pushing when I heard the scraping footsteps moving toward us 
down the tunnel. 

Andrew! 

“Push!” Stephanie cried. 

We shoved ourselves against the wall. 

“Come on—slide! Slide!” I ordered it. 

I glanced back and saw Andrew, jogging slowly, steadily toward us. 

“We’re trapped,” Stephanie moaned. She collapsed against the wall with a 

sigh. 

Andrew came trotting closer. 

“Duane—I want your head!” he called, his voice echoing against the 
concrete walls. 

“Trapped,” Stephanie murmured. 

“Maybe not,” I choked out. I pointed into the dark corner. “Look. A ladder.” 

“Huh?” Stephanie leaped to her feet. She squinted at the ladder. A metal 
ladder, the rungs blanketed with dust. It led straight up the wall, through a small, 
square opening in the low ceiling. 

To where? 

“Give me your head!” the ghost called. 

I grabbed the sides of the metal ladder. I raised a foot onto the first rung and 
peered straight up. 

Into thick blackness. I couldn’t see a thing up there. 

“Duane—” Stephanie whispered. “We don’t know where it leads!” 

“It doesn’t matter,” I replied, starting to climb. “We don’t have a choice— 
do we?” 



29 


“Where are you going, Duane? I need your head!” 

I ignored the ghost’s shout and scrambled up the ladder. Stephanie kept 
bumping me from behind. 

My sneakers slipped on the thick dust. My hands slid over the cold, metal 
railings. 

“Duane—you can’t get away!” Andrew called from down below. 

Straight up. Straight up the ladder. Stephanie and I, breathing hard, 
climbing frantically, as fast as we could climb. 

Straight up. 

Until the ladder started to tilt. 

“Noooo!” I uttered a scream as it spilled forward. 

A crumbling, cracking noise drowned out my scream. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that the wall was breaking apart. 
Crumbling into powdery chunks. 

And we were falling. 

I heard Stephanie scream. 

I grabbed the metal railings with both hands—and held on tight. 

But the ladder was sailing down now. Tumbling over the cracking, 
crumbling old wall. 

“Oww!” I landed hard. Bounced once. Twice. 

My hands flew up and I was tossed off the ladder. I rolled onto my stomach, 
rolled in the chunks of dirt and concrete of the broken wall. 

Stephanie landed on her knees. She shook her head, dazed. 

Chunks of wall spilled all around us. Stephanie’s hair was covered in dust. 

I shielded my eyes and waited for the wall to stop crumbling down. 

When I opened my eyes, Andrew stood above me. His hands were balled 
into fists. His mouth hung open. And he was staring... staring past me. 

I struggled to my feet. Turned to see what he was staring at. 

“A hidden room!” Stephanie cried, moving beside me. “A room behind the 
old wall.” 

Slipping over the chunks of broken concrete, I took a few steps closer to the 



room. 

And saw what Andrew was staring at. 

A head. 

A boy’s head lying on the floor of the hidden room. 

“I don’t believe it!” Stephanie gasped. “We found it! We actually found it!” 

I swallowed hard. And took a careful step forward. 

The head was pale, shimmering white, even in the dim light. 

I could see clearly that it was a boy’s head. But the long, wavy hair had 
turned to white. The round eyes glowed green, sparkling like emeralds in the 
shimmering, pale face. 

“The ghost head,” I murmured. 

I turned back to Andrew. “Your head—we found it for you.” 

I expected to see a smile on his face. I expected him to shout or jump for 

joy- 

For a hundred years, he had waited for this happy moment. And now his 
long search was over. 

But to my shock, Andrew’s face was twisted in horror. 

He wasn’t even looking at his long lost head. He stared above it. And as he 
stared, his entire body began to quiver. Frightened cries escaped his lips. 
“Andrew—what is your problem?” I demanded. 

But I don’t think he even heard me. 

He stared up at the ceiling, trembling. Hands balled into tight fists at his 
sides. Then, slowly, he raised one hand and pointed. “Nooooo,” he moaned. 
“Ohhhh, nooooooo.” 

I turned to see what had frightened him. 

Turned in time to see a filmy figure float down from the ceiling. 

At first I thought it was a thin window curtain, falling from above. 

But as it curled slowly, softly to the floor, I saw that it had arms. And legs. 

I could see right through it! 

The air around us suddenly grew cold. 

“It—it’s a ghost\” Stephanie cried, grabbing my arm. 



30 


The ghost landed softly, silently on the floor of the hidden room, raising its arms 
like bird wings. 

Stephanie and I both gasped as it raised its arms and stood upright. 

It was short and very thin. It wore baggy, old-fashioned-looking pants and a 
long-sleeved shirt with a high collar. 

A high collar. 

A collar. 

And no head. 

The ghost had no head! 

I felt a burst of cold air as it bent down, shimmering, bending, as if made of 
soft gauze. It reached down. Lifted the head off the floor. 

Lifted the head to the stiff, tall collar. 

Gently pressed the head into place. 

And as the head touched the ghostly, gauzy neck, the green eyes flashed. 

The cheeks twitched. The pale white eyebrows arched up and down. 

And then the mouth moved. 

The ghost turned to us—to Stephanie and me. And the lips moved in a 
silent “Thank you.” 

And then the arms rose into the air. Its green eyes still on us, the ghost 
floated up into the air. Lighter than air, it floated silently up. 

I watched in amazement, my heart pounding, until the ghostly figure 
vanished in the darkness. 

And then Stephanie and I both turned to Andrew at the same time. We had 
just seen the headless ghost. We had just seen Andrew, the boy from a hundred 
years ago. We had just watched him collect his head. 

But the boy who claimed to be Andrew was still there. He stood behind us, 
still trembling, his eyes wide, staring into the hidden room, making soft 
swallowing sounds. 

I narrowed my eyes at him. “If you aren’t Andrew,” I started—“if you 
aren’t the headless ghost—then who are you?” 



31 


Stephanie turned on the boy, too. “Yeah. Who are you?” she asked angrily. 

“If you’re not the headless ghost, why did you chase us?” I demanded. 

“Well. I... uh...” The boy raised both hands as if surrendering. Then he 
started to back away. 

He had only gone three or four steps when we heard footsteps coming down 
the long tunnel. 

I turned to Stephanie. Another ghost? 

“Who’s in here?” a deep voice boomed. 

I saw a circle of light from a flashlight sweeping over the tunnel floor. 

“Who is here?” the voice repeated. 

I recognized the deep voice. Otto! 

“Uh... back here,” the boy called softly. 

“Seth—is that you?” The circle of light floated closer. Otto appeared behind 
it, squinting at us. “What’s going on? What are you doing back here? This part 
of the house is dangerous. It’s all falling apart.” 

“Well... we were exploring,” Seth started. “And we got lost. It really wasn’t 
our fault.” 

Otto gazed at Seth sternly. Then his face filled with surprise as his flashlight 
washed over Stephanie and me. “You two! How did you get in? What are you 
doing here?” 

“He... well... he let us in,” I answered. I pointed at Seth. 

Otto turned back to Seth and shook his head unhappily. “More of your 
tricks? Were you scaring these kids?” 

“Not really, Uncle Otto,” Seth replied, keeping his eyes on the ground. 

Uncle Otto? So Seth was Otto’s nephew! 

No wonder he knew so much about Hill House. 

“Tell the truth, Seth,” Otto insisted. “Were you pretending to be a ghost 
again? Haven’t you played that trick on enough kids? Haven’t you scared 
enough kids to death?” 

Seth stood silent. 

Otto rubbed a hand back over his smooth, bald head. Then he let out a 



weary sigh. “We have a business to run here,” he told Seth. “Do you want to 
scare my customers away? Do you want to get the whole neighborhood upset?” 

Seth lowered his head and still didn’t reply. 

I could see that he was in major trouble. So I decided to jump in. “It’s okay, 
Otto,” I said. “He didn’t scare us.” 

“That’s right,” Stephanie chimed in. “We didn’t believe he was a ghost. Did 
we, Duane?” 

“Of course not,” I replied. “He didn’t fool us for a minute.” 

“Especially when we saw the real ghost,” Stephanie added. 

Otto turned to her, studying her in the light from the flashlight. “The what?” 

“The real ghost!” Stephanie insisted. 

“We saw the real ghost, Uncle Otto!” Seth exclaimed. “It was awesomel” 

Otto rolled his eyes. “Save the jokes, Seth. It’s too late at night. You’re just 
trying to get out of trouble.” 

“No. Really!” I insisted. 

“Really!” Seth and Stephanie cried. 

“We saw the headless ghost, Uncle Otto. You’ve got to believe us!” Seth 
pleaded. 

“Sure, sure,” Otto muttered. He turned and motioned with his flashlight. 
“Come on. Everyone out.” 



32 


After our scary night at Hill House, Stephanie and I gave up haunting the 
neighborhood. 

It just wasn’t that exciting anymore. Especially since we’d seen a real 
ghost. 

We stopped sneaking out at night. We stopped peeking into kids’ windows 
in scary masks. We stopped hiding behind bushes and howling like werewolves 
in the middle of the night. 

We gave up all the scary stuff. And we never even talked about ghosts. 

Stephanie and I found other things to be interested in. I tried out for the 
basketball team at school, and I became a starting forward. 

Stephanie joined the Theater Arts Club. This spring, she’s going to be 
Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. Either Dorothy or a Munchkin. 

We had a good winter. Lots of snow. Lots of unscary fun. 

Then late one evening we were heading home from a birthday party. It was 
the first warm night of spring. Tulips were blooming in some of the front yards 
we passed. The air smelled fresh and sweet. 

I stopped in front of Hill House and gazed up at the old mansion. Stephanie 
stopped beside me. She read my mind. “You want to go in, don’t you, Duane?” 

I nodded. “How about taking the tour? We haven’t been in there since...” 
My voice trailed off. 

“Hey, why not?” Stephanie replied. 

We climbed the steep hill. Tall weeds brushed the legs of my jeans as I 
made my way to the front door. The huge old house stood as dark and as creepy 
as ever. 

As Stephanie and I climbed onto the front stoop, the door creaked open. As 
it always had. 

We stepped into the small front entryway. A few seconds later, Otto 
bounced into view. Dressed all in black. A friendly smile on his round, bald 
head. 

“You two!” he exclaimed happily. “Welcome back.” He called into the front 
room. “Edna, come see who is here.” 

Edna came tottering into the room. “Oh, my!” she cried, pressing a hand 



against her pale, wrinkled face. “We were wondering if we would see you two 
again.” 

I gazed into the front room. No other customers. 

“Could you take us on the tour?” I asked Otto. 

He smiled his toothy smile. “Of course. Wait. I’ll get my lantern.” 

Otto took us around Hill House. He gave us the complete tour. 

It was great to see the house again. But it no longer held any secrets for 
Stephanie and me. 

After the tour, we thanked Otto and said good night. 

We were halfway down the hill when a police car pulled up to the curb. A 
dark-uniformed officer stuck his head out of the passenger window. “What were 
you kids doing up there?” he called. 

Stephanie and I made our way down to the police car. The two officers eyed 
us suspiciously. 

“We just took the tour,” I explained, pointing up to Hill House. 

“Tour? What tour?” the officer demanded gruffly. 

“You know. The haunted house tour,” Stephanie replied impatiently. 

The police officer stuck his head farther out the window. He had blue eyes, 
and freckles all over his face. “What were you really doing up there?” he asked 
softly. 

“We told you,” I said shrilly. “Taking the tour. That’s all.” 

Behind the wheel, the other policeman chuckled. “Maybe a ghost gave 
them the tour,” he told his partner. 

“There are no tours,” the freckle-faced officer said, frowning. “There 
haven’t been any tours in that house for months.” 

Stephanie and I both uttered cries of surprise. 

“The house is empty,” the police officer continued. “Shut down. There 
hasn’t been anyone in there all winter. Hill House went out of business three 
months ago.” 

“Huh?” Stephanie and I exchanged startled glances. Then we both turned to 
gaze up at the house. 

The gray stone turrets rose up into the purple-black sky. Nothing but 
darkness all around. 

And then I saw a trail of soft light across the front window. Lantern light. 
Orange and soft as smoke. 

In the soft light, I saw Otto and Edna. They floated in front of the window. I 



could see right through them, as if they were made of gauze. 

They’re ghosts, too, I realized, staring into the soft, smoky light. 
I blinked. And the light faded out.

THE ABOMINABLE 
SNOWMAN OF PASADENA 

Goosebumps - 38 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


All my life, I’ve wanted to see snow. 

My name is Jordan Blake. My life has been twelve years of sun, sand, and 
chlorine. I’d never felt cold, ever —unless you count air-conditioned 
supermarkets. And I don’t. It doesn’t snow in the supermarket. 

I’d never felt cold, that is, until the adventure. 

Some people think I’m a lucky guy to live in Pasadena, California, where 
it’s always sunny and warm. It’s okay, I guess. But if you’ve never seen snow, it 
seems like something out of a science-fiction movie. 

Fluffy white frozen water that falls out of the sky? It piles up on the ground, 
and you can make forts and snowmen and snowballs out of it? You have to admit 
it sounds weird. 

One day, my wish came true. I got to see snow at last. And it turned out to 
be weirder than I thought. 

Way weirder. 

“Pay attention, kids. This is going to be cool.” 

Dad’s face glowed under the red darkroom light. My sister, Nicole, and I 
watched him developing film. With a pair of tongs, he dipped a sheet of special 
paper in a chemical bath. 

I’ve watched Dad develop film all my life. He’s a professional 
photographer. But I’d never seen him so excited about photos before—and that’s 
saying a lot. 

Dad takes nature photos. Well, actually, he takes pictures of everything! 

He never stops taking pictures. My mom says that once when I was a baby I 
saw Dad and screamed. I didn’t recognize him without a camera in front of his 
face. I used to think he had a zoom lens for a nose! 

Our house is filled with embarrassing pictures of me—me as a baby in 
baggy diapers, me with food all over my face, me crying after scraping my knee, 
me hitting my sister... 

Anyway, Dad had just returned from a trip to the Grand Tetons. That’s a 
mountain range in Wyoming—part of the Rocky Mountains. He was all worked 
up about the pictures he took there. 

“I wish you kids had seen those bears,” Dad said. “A whole family of them. 



The cubs reminded me of you two—always teasing each other.” 

Teasing. Ha. Dad thinks Nicole and I tease each other. That’s putting it 
mildly. Nicole—Miss Know-it-all—drives me crazy. 

Sometimes I wish she’d never been born. I’ve made it my mission to make 
her feel the same way. I mean, I try to make her wish she’d never been born. 

“You should have taken us with you to the Grand Tetons, Dad,” I 
complained. 

“It’s very cold in Wyoming this time of year,” Nicole said. 

“How do you know, Brainiac?” I jabbed her in the ribs. “You’ve never been 
to Wyoming.” 

“I read up on it while Dad was away,” she explained. Of course. “There’s a 
picture book about it in the library if you want to know more, Jordan. It’s just 
right for you—it’s for first graders.” 

I couldn’t think of anything to say back. That’s my problem. I’m too slow 
with the comebacks. So I jabbed her again. 

“Hey, hey,” Dad murmured. “No jabbing. I’m working here.” 

Dumb Nicole. Not that she’s dumb—she’s really smart. But in a dumb way 
—that’s my opinion. She’s so smart she skipped fifth grade—and landed in my 
class. She’s a year younger than I am and she’s in my class —and she gets 
straight A’s. 

Dad’s pictures floated in the chemical bath, slowly becoming clear. “Did it 
snow in the mountains while you were there, Dad?” I asked. 

“Sure, it snowed,” Dad replied. He was concentrating on his work. 

“Did you go skiing?” I asked. 

Dad shook his head. “I was too busy working.” 

“How about ice-skating?” Nicole asked. 

Nicole acts as if she knows everything. But like me, she’d never seen snow, 
either. We’d never left Southern California—and you could tell by looking at us. 

We’re both tan all year round. Nicole’s hair is greenish-blond from the 
chlorine in the community pool, and mine is brown with blond streaks. We’re on 
the school swim team. 

“I’ll bet it’s snowing at Mom’s house right now,” Nicole said. 

“Could be,” Dad replied. 

Mom and Dad are divorced. Mom just moved to Pennsylvania. We’re going 
to spend the summer with her. But we stayed in California with Dad to finish out 
the school year. 



Mom sent us some pictures of her new house. It was covered with snow. I 
stared at the pictures, trying to imagine the cold. 

“I wish we stayed at Mom’s house while you were gone,” I said. 

“Jordan, we’ve been over this.” Dad sounded a little impatient. “You can 
visit your mother when she’s settled. She hasn’t even bought furniture yet. 
Where would you sleep?” 

“I’d rather sleep on a bare floor than listen to Mrs. Witchens snoring on the 
couch,” I grumbled. 

Mrs. Witchens stayed with Nicole and me while Dad was away. She was a 
nightmare. Every morning we had to clean our rooms—she actually inspected 
them for dust. Every single night she served us liver, brussels sprouts, and fish- 
head soup with a tall glass of soy milk. 

“Her name’s not Witchens ,” Nicole corrected me. “It’s Hitchens .” 

“I know that, Sicole,” I retorted. 

Under the red light in the darkroom, the photos grew clearer. I heard 
excitement in Dad’s voice. 

“If these shots come out well, I can publish them in a book,” he said. “I will 
call it The Brown Bears of Wyoming, by Garrison Blake. Yes, that has a nice ring 
to it.” 

He stopped to pull a photo out of the liquid. It dripped as he stared at it. 

“That’s weird,” he murmured. 

“What’s weird?” Nicole asked. 

He set the picture down without saying anything. Nicole and I glanced at it. 

“Dad—” Nicole said. “I hate to break it to you, but that looks like a teddy 
bear.” 

It was a picture of a teddy bear. A stuffed brown toy bear with a lopsided 
grin, sitting in the grass. Not the kind of creature you usually find in the Grand 
Tetons. 

“There must be some mistake,” Dad said. “Wait until the rest of the photos 
develop. You’ll see. They’re amazing.” 

He pulled up another picture. He studied it. “Huh?” 

I grabbed the photo. Another teddy bear. 

Dad picked up a third picture. Then a fourth. He moved faster and faster. 

“More teddy bears!” he cried. He was frantic. Even in the darkroom, I could 
see the panic on his face. 

“What’s going on?” he shouted. “Where are the photos I took?” 



2 


“Dad—” Nicole began. “Are you sure those bears you saw were real?” 

“Of course I’m sure!” Dad boomed at her. “I know the difference between a 
brown bear and a teddy bear!” 

He began to pace back and forth across the darkroom floor. “Did I lose the 
film somehow?” he murmured, clutching his head with one hand. “Could 
someone have switched it?” 

“The weird part is that you were taking pictures of bears,” Nicole noted. 
“And you ended up with teddy bears. That’s just so strange.” 

Dad furiously tapped his hands on the developing table. He muttered to 
himself. He was starting to lose it. 

“Did I lose the film on the plane somehow? Switch carry-on bags with 
someone else, maybe?” 

I turned my back to Dad, my shoulders shaking. 

“Jordan? What’s the matter?” Dad grabbed my shoulders. “Are you all 
right?” 

He spun me around. “Jordan!” Dad cried. “You’re—laughing!” 

Nicole crossed her arms. She narrowed her eyes at me. “What did you do to 
Dad’s pictures?” 

Dad frowned. His voice was calmer now. “All right, Jordan. What’s the big 
joke?” 

I gasped for breath, trying to stop laughing. “Don’t worry, Dad. Your 
pictures are okay.” 

He shoved one of the teddy bear shots in my face. “Okay! You call this 
okay?!” 

“I borrowed your camera before you left for Wyoming,” I explained. “I 
took a bunch of shots of my old teddy bear, for a joke. The rest of the film 
should have your real bears on it.” 

I can’t resist a good practical joke. 

Nicole said, “I had nothing to do with it, Dad. I swear.” 

Little Miss Goody-Goody. 

Dad shook his head. “A joke?” He turned back to the photos and developed 
a few more. The next shot showed a real bear cub fishing in a stream. Dad 



laughed. 

“You know,” he said, putting the picture of the real bear next to one of the 
teddy bear shots, “they don’t look as different as you’d think.” 

I knew Dad wouldn’t stay angry. He never does. That’s one reason I like to 
play tricks on him. He likes to play practical jokes, too. 

“Did I ever tell you about the trick I pulled on Joe Morrison?” he asked. Joe 
Morrison is a photographer friend of Dad’s. 

“Joe had just gotten back from Africa, where he had spent months 
photographing gorillas. He was all excited about these fabulous gorilla shots 
he’d taken. I saw the pictures, and they were really spectacular. 

“Joe had a big meeting set up with the editor of a nature magazine. He was 
going to go in and show the editor these photos. He was sure the magazine 
would snap them up in a second. 

“Joe didn’t know that the editor and I had gone to college together. So I 
called her up and asked her to help me play a little joke on Joe. 

“When Joe went to see her, he showed her the pictures. She looked at them 
without saying a word. 

“Finally he couldn’t stand the suspense any longer. He blurted out, ‘Well? 
Do you like them or not?’ He’s an impatient guy, Joe.” 

“What did she say?” I asked. 

“She frowned and said, ‘You’re a good photographer, Mr. Morrison. But 
I’m afraid you’ve been tricked. The creatures you photographed aren’t gorillas at 
all.’ 

“Joe’s jaw practically fell off his face. He said, ‘What do you mean, they’re 
not gorillas?’ 

“She said, with a perfectly straight face, ‘They’re people in gorilla suits. 
Can’t you tell the difference between a real gorilla and a man in a gorilla suit, 
Mr. Morrison?”’ 

I chuckled. Nicole asked, “Then what happened?” 

“Joe practically had a nervous breakdown. He snatched up the photos and 
stared at them. He shouted, ‘I don’t get it! How could that happen? I spent six 
months of my life studying people in gorilla suits?’ 

“Finally the editor burst out laughing and told him it was a joke. She loved 
the photos and wanted to publish them. Joe wouldn’t believe her at first—it took 
her fifteen minutes to get him to calm down.” 

Dad and I both laughed. 



“I think that’s really mean, Dad,” Nicole scolded. 

I get my joker streak from Dad. Nicole takes after Mom. She’s more 
practical. 

“Joe thought it was funny once he got over the shock,” Dad assured her. 
“He’s played his share of tricks on me, believe me.” 

Dad swished another photo through the chemical bath. Then he held it up 
with his tongs. It showed two bear cubs wrestling. He smiled with satisfaction. 

“This roll came out great,” he said. “But I’ve got a lot more work to do in 
here, kids. Go on outside for a while, okay?” 

He turned the red light off and flipped on the normal light. Nicole opened 
the door. 

“Don’t get all messed up and dirty, though,” Dad added. “We’re all going 
out to dinner tonight. I want to celebrate my luck with the brown bears.” 

“We’ll be careful,” Nicole promised. 

“Speak for yourself,” I said. 

“I mean it, Jordan,” Dad warned. 

“Just kidding, Dad.” 

A wave of heat blasted us when we opened the darkroom door. Nicole and I 
stepped out into the backyard, blinking in the afternoon sun. It always takes my 
eyes a long time to adjust after I’ve been in the darkroom. 

“What do you want to do?” Nicole asked. 

“I don’t know,” I replied. “It’s so hot. It’s too hot to do much of anything.” 

Nicole closed her eyes and zoned out for a minute. 

“Nicole?” I nudged her. “Nicole? What are you doing?” 

“I’m thinking about the snow in Dad’s pictures of the Grand Tetons. I 
thought it would make me feel cooler.” 

She stood perfectly still with her eyes closed. A bead of sweat dripped 
down her forehead. 

“Well?” I asked. “Is it working?” 

She opened her eyes and shook her head. “No. How can I imagine snow if 
I’ve never felt it?” 

“Good point.” I sighed and gazed around me. 

We live in a subdivision in the suburbs of Pasadena. There are only three 
different kinds of houses in our neighborhood. The same three house styles are 
repeated for miles around. 

It’s so boring to look at, it makes me feel even hotter, somehow. Each block 



has a couple of palm trees, not enough to give much shade. There’s a vacant lot 
across the street from us, next door to the Millers’. The most exciting feature of 
our backyard—maybe the whole block—is Dad’s disgusting compost heap. 

I squinted and stared some more. Everything appeared bleached in the 
sunlight. Even the grass looked almost white. 

“I’m so bored I could scream,” I complained. 

“Let’s ride our bikes,” Nicole suggested. “Maybe the breeze will cool us 

off.” 

“Maybe Lauren will want to go with us,” I added. 

Lauren Sax lives next door to us. She’s in our class at school. I see her so 
often, she might as well be my sister. 

We rolled out our bikes from the garage and walked them over to Lauren’s. 
We left our bikes at the side of her house. Then we went around back. 

We found Lauren sitting on a towel under a palm tree in her backyard. 
Nicole sat beside Lauren on the towel. I leaned against the tree. 

“It’s so hot!” Lauren whined. She tugged on her yellow shorts. She’s tall 
and muscular, with long brown hair and bangs. 

She has a nasal voice, good for complaining. “This is supposed to be winter. 
It’s winter everywhere else. A normal winter has snow and ice and sleet and 
freezing rain and cold, cold air. What do we get? Nothing but sun! Why do we 
have to be so hot?” 

Suddenly I felt a pain in my back. 

“Ow!” I jerked forward. Something stabbed me. Something stinging sharp 
—and ice cold! My face twisted in pain. 

“Jordan!” Nicole gasped. “What’s wrong? What’s wrong?” 



3 


I clutched the icy spot on my back. “What is it?” I cried. “It’s so cold!” 

Nicole jumped to her feet and examined my back. “Jordan, you’ve been 
stabbed!” she announced. “With a purple Popsicle!” 

As I turned around I heard mean laughter. The Miller twins jumped out 
from behind the tree. 

I should’ve known. The Miller twins—Kyle and Kara. The twin pug noses, 
the beady little eyes, the matching short-cropped red hair. Yuck. They carried 
twin Super Soakers, red ones. 

The Miller twins love practical jokes. They’re worse than I am. And much 
meaner. 

Everyone in the neighborhood is afraid of them. They pounce on little kids 
waiting at the bus stop and rob them of their lunch money. Once they blew up 
the Saxes’ mailbox with a stink bomb. Last year, Kyle sucker-punched me 
during a basketball game. He thought it was funny to watch me turn purple. 

The Millers like to pick on me more than anyone, for some reason. 

Kara is just as scary as her brother Kyle. I hate to admit it, but Kara can 
take me out with one punch. I know that for a fact. She gave me a black eye last 
summer. 

“‘Oh, it’s so hot. It’s so hot!”’ Kara sneered, making fun of Lauren’s whiny 
voice. 

Kyle flipped his Super Soaker from one hand to the other behind his back. 
He tried to make it look like a really complicated move. 

“Arnold taught me how to do that,” he bragged. 

Kyle wanted me to think he was talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger. He 
claims he knows Arnold. I have my doubts. 

Nicole tugged on the back of my shirt. “Dad’s going to kill you, Jordan,” 
she said. 

“Why?” 

I craned my neck backwards. The back of my white polo shirt was stained 
dark purple. 

“Oh, great,” I muttered. 

“Dad said not to get messed up,” Nicole reminded me. As if I needed to be 



reminded. 

“Don’t worry, Jordan,” Kyle said. “We’ll clean it off for you.” 

“Uh—that’s okay,” I murmured, backing away. Whatever Kyle meant by 
“clean it off”, I knew I wouldn’t like it. 

I was right. 

He and Kara raised their Super Soakers and squirted me, Nicole, and 
Lauren. 

“Stop it!” Lauren screamed. “You’re getting us all wet!” 

Kyle and Kara laughed their maniac laughs. “You said you were hot!” 

They drenched us. My shirt was so wet I could wring a glass of water out of 
it. I glared at them. 

Kyle shrugged. “We were only trying to help.” 

Yeah. Sure they were. 

I should’ve been grateful that all they did was soak us. We got off easy. 

I can’t stand the Miller twins. Neither can Nicole and Lauren. They think 
they’re so hot. Just because they’re thirteen and they have a swimming pool in 
their backyard. 

Their father works at a movie studio. They’re always bragging about how 
they go to sneak previews and hang out with movie stars. 

I haven’t seen a movie star show up at their house yet. Not once. 

“Aw, you’re all wet,” Kara said, sneering. “Why don’t you take a bike ride 
to dry off?” 

Nicole and I exchanged glances. When we’re alone, we don’t get along so 
well. But when the Millers are around, we have to stick together. 

We knew the Millers too well. They wouldn’t mention our bikes without a 
reason. A bad reason. 

“What did you do to our bikes?” Nicole demanded. 

The Millers faked wide-eyed innocence. “Who—us? We didn’t do anything 
to your precious bikes. Go see for yourself.” 

Nicole and I glanced around the side of Lauren’s house, where we’d left our 
bikes. 

“They look okay from here,” Nicole whispered. 

“There’s something wrong with them,” I said. “They look weird.” 

We approached our bikes. They looked weird all right. The handlebars had 
been unscrewed and twisted backwards. 

“Hope you have reverse gear,” Kyle snickered. 



Normally, I’m not the kind of guy who goes around getting into fights. But 
something in me snapped. This time Kyle and Kara had gone too far. 

I jumped on Kyle. We tumbled to the ground. We wrestled. I tried to pin 
him with my knee, but he pushed me over onto my side. 

“Stop it!” Nicole screamed. “Stop it!” 

Kyle rolled me onto my back. “You thought you could jump me, Jordan? 
You’re too big a wimp!” 

I kicked him. He pinned my shoulder to the ground with one knee. 

Nicole shouted hysterically, “Jordan! Look out!” 

I glanced up. Kara stood over me, clutching a rock the size of her head. A 
mean grin spread across her face. 

“Drop it, Kara!” Kyle ordered. 

I tried to roll out of the way, but I couldn’t move. Kyle had me pinned. 

Kara heaved the rock. Then she let it drop—right onto my head. 



4 


I squeezed my eyes shut. 

The rock landed on my forehead—and bounced off. 

I opened my eyes. Kara laughed like a hyena. She picked up the rock and 
dropped it on my face again. It bounced off, just like the first time. 

Lauren grabbed it. “It’s made of sponge,” she announced. She squeezed it 
in her hand. “It’s a fake.” 

Kyle laughed. “It’s a movie prop, moron.” 

“You should’ve seen your face,” Kara added. “What a chicken!” 

I kicked Kyle off me and pounced on him again. This time I was so mad I 
had the strength of two Kyles. I wrestled him to the ground. I had him pinned! 

“What’s going on, guys?” 

Uh-oh. Dad. 

I leaped to my feet. “Hi, Dad. We were just kidding around.” 

Kyle sat up, rubbing his elbow. 

Dad didn’t even seem to notice that we’d been fighting. He was excited 
about something. 

“Listen, kids—I have great news. Wilderness magazine just called. They 
want to fly me to Alaska!” 

“Great, Dad,” I said sarcastically. “You get to go on another exciting trip 
while we stay here and die of boredom.” 

“And heat,” Nicole added. 

Dad laughed. “I called Mrs. Hitchens to see if she could come stay with you 
again—” he began. 

“Not Mrs. Hitchens again!” I cried. “Dad, she’s horrible! I can’t stand her 
cooking. I’ll starve to death if she stays with us!” 

“You will not, Jordan,” Nicole said. “Even if you ate only bread and water, 
you could survive a week easily.” 

“Nicole? Jordan? Hello?” Dad said, knocking lightly on our heads. “Will 
you please listen to me? I haven’t finished yet.” 

“Sorry, Dad.” 

“Anyway, Mrs. Hitchens can’t come. So, I guess you two will just have to 



come along with me.” 

“To Alaska?” I cried. I was too excited to believe it. 

“Hurray!” Nicole yelled. We jumped up and down. 

“You guys are so lucky!” Lauren said. Kara and Kyle stood by. Saying 
nothing. 

“We’re going to Alaska!” I shouted. “We’ll get to see snow! Tons of snow! 
Alaskan snow!” 

I was thrilled. And Dad hadn’t even told us the interesting part yet. 

“It’s a strange project,” Dad continued. “They want me to track down some 
kind of snow creature—an Abominable Snowman.” 

“Wow!” I gasped. 

Kyle and Kara snorted. 

Nicole shook her head. “An Abominable Snowman? Has anybody really 
seen him?” 

Dad nodded. “Some kind of snow creature has been spotted. Who knows 
what it really is. Whatever it is, the magazine wants me to shoot photos of it. I’m 
sure it’s a wild-goose chase. There’s no such thing as an Abominable 
Snowman.” 

“So why are you going?” Nicole asked. 

I poked her in the ribs. “Who cares? We’re going to Alaska!” 

“The magazine is paying a big fee,” Dad explained. “And even if we don’t 
find a snow creature, I’ll still get some great shots of the tundra.” 

Lauren asked, “What’s a tundra?” 

Dad began to reply, but Nicole stepped forward. “I’ll handle this one, Dad,” 
she interrupted. I felt like screaming. She does that in school all the time, too. 

“A tundra is a huge frozen plain. It exists in the Arctic, in Alaska, and in 
Russia. The word tundra comes from the Russian, meaning—” 

I clapped my hand over her big mouth. “Any other questions, Lauren?” 

Lauren shook her head. “That’s all I needed to know.” 

“Egghead here goes on forever if you don’t stop her.” I let go of Nicole’s 
mouth. She stuck her tongue out at me. 

“This trip is going to be great,” I cried happily. “We’ll see ice and snow for 
real! We’re going hunting for an Abominable Snowman! Awesome!” 

An hour earlier we’d been bored out of our minds. Now suddenly 
everything had changed. 

Dad smiled. “I’ve got to go back to the darkroom for a while. Don’t forget 



—we’re going out to dinner tonight.” He wandered back across the lawn and 
into the house. 

As soon as Dad was gone, Kara started laughing. “An Abominable 
Snowman! What a joke!” 

Typical Kara—she was too chicken to say a word while Dad was around. 

Kyle made fun of me, jumping up and down and squealing, “Alaska! 
Alaska! I’ll get to see snow!” 

“You both will probably turn blue and freeze,” Kara sneered. 

“We’ll be fine,” Nicole said. “It’s your turn to freeze!” She grabbed Kara’s 
Super Soaker and sent a spray of water into Kara’s face. 

“Stop it!” Kyle shouted. He dove at Nicole. Nicole laughed and ran away, 
turning around to soak them every few feet. 

“Give that back!” Kara yelled. 

The Millers chased Nicole. Kyle raised his Super Soaker and let Nicole 
have it in the back. 

Lauren and I ran after them. Nicole raced into our backyard. She turned 
around and squirted the Millers again. 

“You can’t catch me!” she cried, shooting and walking backward. 

She was backing right into Dad’s compost heap. 

Should I warn her? I thought. 

No way. 

“Take that!” she shouted, blasting the Millers with water. 

Then she slipped and fell backward—into the compost heap. 

“Yuck,” Lauren groaned. 

Nicole stood up slowly. Greenish-brown slime oozed in her hair and 
dripped down her back, her arms, and her legs. “Ugh!” she screamed, frantically 
wiping the glop off her hands. “Uggghhh!” 

We all stood and stared. She looked like some kind of Abominable 
Snowman herself. All covered in glop. 

We were still staring when Dad popped his head out the back door. “You 
kids ready to go to dinner?” he called.

“There it is!” Dad shouted over the roar of the small plane’s engine. “Iknek. 
That’s the airstrip.” 

I stared out the window at the tiny brown patch where we’d be landing. For 
the last half hour I’d seen nothing but miles and miles of snow. Wow. It was so 
white ! 

It was cool the way the snow sparkled in the sunlight. It made me think of 
Christmas carols. I couldn’t get “Winter Wonderland” out of my head—and it 
was driving me crazy! 

I watched for giant footprints as we flew. How big would an Abominable 
Snowman’s footsteps be? Big enough to see from a low-flying plane? 

“I hope there’s a restaurant down there,” Nicole said. “I’m starving.” 

Dad patted her shoulder. “We’ll have a big, hot meal before we set out. But 
after that, it’s camping food.” 

“How are we going to build a fire in the snow?” Nicole asked. 

“We’ll be staying in a little cabin,” Dad replied. “It’s a long way out in the 
tundra, but it’s better than sleeping in tents. There should be a stove in the cabin. 
I hope so, anyway.” 

“Can we build an igloo and sleep in that?” I asked. “Or dig out an ice 
cave?” 

“You can’t build an igloo just like that, Jordan,” Nicole snapped. “It’s not 
like a snow fort or something. Right, Dad?” 

Dad took the lens cap off his camera and started taking pictures through the 
plane window. “Sure,” he said absently. “Uh-huh.” 

Nicole turned to the window, too. I mimicked her behind her back. You 
can’t build an igloo just like that, I mouthed. She acts like she’s my teacher or 
something. It’s really embarrassing when she does it in front of everybody at 
school. 

“How are we going to find the cabin?” Nicole asked. “Everything looks the 
same in all this snow.” 

Dad turned and snapped a picture of her. “Did you say something, Nicole?” 

“I was wondering how we’re going to find the cabin,” Nicole repeated. “Do 
you know how to use a compass, Dad?” 



“A compass? No, but that doesn’t matter. A man named Arthur Maxwell is 
supposed to meet us at the airport. He’ll be our guide through the tundra.” 

“I know Arthur,” the pilot shouted back to us. “He’s an old musher from 
way back. Knows everything about dogs and sleds. He knows this part of Alaska 
better than anybody, I guess.” 

“Maybe he’s seen the Abominable Snowman,” I suggested. 

“How do you know there is such a thing?” Nicole taunted. “We haven’t 
seen any sign of him yet.” 

“Nicole, people have seen him with their own eyes,” I replied. “And if 
there’s no such thing, what are we doing here?” 

“Some people say they’ve seen him,” Nicole said. “Or maybe they think 
they’ve seen one. I won’t believe it until I get more facts.” 

The plane circled the small town. I played with the zipper on my new 
Arctic jacket. I’d been hungry a few minutes earlier, but now I was too excited to 
think about food. 

There really is an Abominable Snowman down there, I thought. I know 
there is. I felt a chill, despite a blast of hot air from the plane’s heater. 

What if we find him? What will happen then? 

What will happen if the Abominable Snowman doesn’t like to be 
photographed? 

The plane flew very low now, getting ready to land. We touched down with 
a bump and taxied along the runway. The plane lurched as the pilot put on the 
brakes. 

Something big loomed at the end of the runway. Something huge, white, 
and monstrous. 

“Dad, look!” I cried. “I see him! The Abominable Snowman!” 



6 


The plane squealed to a stop right in front of the big monster. 

Dad, Nicole, and the pilot all laughed—at me. 

I hate that. But I couldn’t blame them. The big white monster was a polar 

bear. 

A statue of a polar bear. 

“The polar bear is the symbol of the town,” the pilot explained. 

“Oh,” I murmured. I knew I was blushing. I turned away. 

“Jordan knew that,” Dad said. “He was just playing one of his practical 
jokes.” 

“Uh—yeah.” I went along with it. “I knew it was a statue all along.” 

“You did not, Jordan,” Nicole said. “You were really scared!” 

I punched Nicole in the arm. “I was not! It was a joke.” 

Dad put an arm around each of us. “Isn’t it great the way these two kid each 
other?” he said to the pilot. 

“If you say so,” the pilot replied. 

We hopped out of the plane. The pilot opened the cargo hold. Nicole and I 
grabbed our backpacks. 

Dad had brought a huge, airtight trunk for film, cameras, food, sleeping 
bags, and other supplies. The pilot helped him carry it off the airstrip. 

The trunk was so big, Dad could fit inside it. It reminded me of a red plastic 
coffin. 

Iknek Airport was like a tiny wooden house, just two rooms. Two pilots in 
leather jackets sat at a table playing cards. 

A tall, brawny man with dark hair, a thick beard, and leathery skin stood up 
and crossed the room to greet us. His gray parka hung open over a flannel shirt 
and deerskin pants. 

This must be our guide, I realized. 

“Mr. Blake?” the man said to Dad. His voice was low and hoarse. “I’m 
Arthur Maxwell. Need some help there?” He grabbed one end of the trunk from 
the pilot. 

“This is an awfully big trunk you brought,” Arthur added. “Do you really 
need all this stuff?” 



Dad reddened. “I’ve got a lot of cameras, tripods and things.... Well, maybe 
I overpacked.” 

Arthur frowned at me and Nicole. “I’d say so.” 

“Call me Garry,” Dad said. “These are my kids, Jordan and Nicole.” He 
nodded toward us. 

Nicole said “Hi,” and I added, “Nice to meet you.” I can be polite when I 
have to be. 

Arthur stared at us. Then he grunted. 

“You didn’t mention kids,” he mumbled to Dad after a minute. 

“I’m sure I did,” Dad protested. 

“I don’t remember it,” Arthur replied, frowning. 

Everyone was silent. We pushed through the airport door and started down 
the muddy road. 

“I’m hungry,” I said. “Let’s go into town and get some food.” 

“How far is it to town, Arthur?” Dad asked. 

“How far?” Arthur echoed. “You’re looking at it.” 

I stared around in surprise. There was only one road. It began at the airport 
and ended in a pile of snow about two blocks away. A few wooden buildings 
were sprinkled along it. 

“This is it?” I cried. 

“It’s not Pasadena,” Arthur grumbled. “But we call it home.” 

He led us down the muddy road to a diner called Betty’s. 

“I guess you’re hungry,” he grumbled. “Might as well eat a hot meal before 
we set out.” 

We settled into a booth by a window. Nicole and I ordered hamburgers, 
french fries, and Cokes. Dad and Arthur ordered coffee and beef stew. 

“I’ve got a sled and four dogs ready to go,” Arthur announced. “The dogs 
can pull this trunk of yours and the other supplies. We’ll walk beside the sled.” 

“That sounds fine,” Dad said. 

“Whoa!!” I protested. “We’re walking? How far?” 

“Ten miles or so,” Arthur replied. 

“Ten miles!” I’d never walked that far before. “Why do we have to walk? 
Why can’t we take a helicopter or something?” 

“Because I want to take photos along the way, Jordan,” Dad explained. 
“The landscape is fascinating. You never know what we’ll come across.” 

Maybe we’ll come across the Abominable Snowman, I thought. That would 



be cool. 

Our food arrived. We all ate in silence. Arthur wouldn’t look me in the eye. 
He wouldn’t look any of us in the eye. He stared out the window while he ate. 
Outside on the street, a Jeep drove by. 

“Have you ever seen this snow creature we’re looking for?” Dad asked 
Arthur. 

Arthur speared a piece of meat with his fork and popped it into his mouth. 
He chewed. He chewed some more. Dad, Nicole, and I all watched him, waiting 
for his answer. 

Finally he swallowed. “Never seen it,” he said. “Heard about it, though. 
Lots of stories.” 

I waited to hear one of the stories. But Arthur kept on eating. 

I couldn’t stand waiting any longer. “What kind of stories?” 

He swabbed at some gravy with his bread. He stuffed it into his mouth. 
Chewed. Swallowed. 

“A couple of people in town,” he said. “They’ve seen the monster.” 
“Where?” Dad asked. 

“Out by the big snow ridge,” Arthur said. “Beyond the musher’s cabin. 
Where we’re staying.” 

“What does he look like?” I asked. 

“They say he’s big,” Arthur said. “Big and covered with brown fur. You 
might think he’s a bear. But he’s not. He walks on two feet like a man.” 

I shuddered. The Abominable Snowman sounded a lot like a vicious cave 
monster I saw in a horror movie once. 

Arthur shook his head. “Personally, I hope we never find him.” 

Dad’s jaw dropped. “But that’s what we’re here for. It’s my job to find him 
—if he exists.” 

“He exists all right,” Arthur declared. “Friend of mine—another musher— 
he was out in a blizzard one day. Ran smack into the snow monster.” 

“What happened?” I asked. 

“You don’t want to know.” Arthur stuffed more bread into his mouth. 

“We certainly do want to know,” Dad persisted. 

Arthur stroked his beard. “The monster picked up one of the dogs and made 
off with him. My friend chased after him, trying to get the dog back. Never 
found him. But he could hear the dog whining. Pitiful howls. Whatever 
happened to that dog—it sounded pretty bad.” 



“He’s probably a carnivore,” Nicole said. “A meat-eater. Most animals 
around here are. There’s so little vegetation—” 

I jabbed Nicole. “I want to hear about the snowman—not your stupid nature 
facts.” 

Arthur flashed Nicole an annoyed glance. I figured he was thinking, What 
planet is she from? That’s what I’m usually thinking, anyway. 

He cleared his throat and continued. “My friend came back to town. He and 
another guy went out to try and capture the snow monster. Darn foolish, if you 
ask me.” 

“What happened to them?” I asked. 

“Don’t know,” Arthur said. “They never came back.” 

“Huh?” I gaped at the big guide. I swallowed hard. “Excuse me? Did you 
say they never came back?” 

Arthur nodded solemnly. “They never came back.”

“Maybe they got lost in the tundra,” Dad suggested. 

“Doubt it,” Arthur said. “Those two knew what they were doing. The 
monster killed them. That’s what happened.” 

He paused to butter another slice of bread. 

“Close your mouth, Jordan,” Nicole said. “I don’t want to look at your 
chewed-up french fries.” 

I guess my mouth had been hanging open. I shut it and swallowed. 

Arthur seems like a weird guy, I thought. But he’s not lying to us. He 
definitely believes in the Abominable Snowman. 

Nicole asked him, “Has anyone else seen the snow monster?” 

“Yep. A couple of TV people from New York. They heard about what 
happened to my friend and came to town to investigate. They set out into the 
tundra. Never came back, either. We found one of them, frozen to death in a 
block of ice. Who knows what became of the other. 

“Then Mrs. Carter—she lives at the end of Main Street—she saw the snow 
monster a few days later,” Arthur continued in a low voice. “She was looking 
through her telescope and spied him out in the tundra. He was chewing on bones, 
she said. Don’t believe me, go ask her yourself.” 

Dad made a noise. I glanced at him. He was trying to keep from laughing. 

I didn’t see what was so funny. This snow monster sounded pretty scary to 
me. 

Arthur glared at Dad. “You don’t have to believe me if you don’t want to, 
Mr. Blake,” he said. 

“Call me Garry,” Dad repeated. 

“I’ll call you what I please, Mr. Blake,” Arthur said sharply. “What I’m 
telling you is true. That monster is real—and he’s a killer! You’re taking a big 
risk, chasing after him. No one has ever caught him. Anyone who goes out after 
him... doesn’t return.” 

“We’ll take our chances,” Dad said. “I’ve heard stories like this before, in 
other parts of the world. Stories about monsters in the jungle or weird creatures 
in the ocean. So far the stories have never turned out to be true. I have a feeling 
the Abominable Snowman will be no different.” 



Part of me really wanted to see the snow creature. But part of me hoped 
Dad was right. I don’t deserve to die, I thought—just because I want to see 
snow! 

“Well,” Dad said, wiping his mouth. “Let’s get going. Everybody ready?” 

“I’m ready,” Nicole piped up. 

“Me too,” I said. I couldn’t wait to get out in the snow. 

Arthur said nothing. Dad paid the lunch check. 

We waited for change. “Dad,” I asked, “what if the Abominable Snowman 
is real? What if we run into him? What will we do?” 

He pulled something small and black out of his coat pocket. 

“This is a radio transmitter,” he explained. “If we get into any kind of 
trouble out in the wilderness, I can radio the ranger station in town. They’ll send 
a helicopter to rescue us.” 

“What kind of trouble, Dad?” Nicole asked. 

“I’m sure there won’t be any trouble,” Dad assured us. “But it’s good to be 
prepared for emergencies. Right, Arthur?” 

Arthur smacked his lips and cleared his throat. But he didn’t reply. I figured 
he was angry because Dad didn’t believe his stories about the snow monster. 

Dad returned the radio transmitter to his coat pocket. He left a tip for the 
waitress. Then we spilled outside into the cold Alaskan air, ready to head out for 
the frozen tundra. 

Was an Abominable Snowman waiting for us somewhere out there? 

We would soon find out.

Smack! 

Bulls-eye. I hit Nicole in the middle of her backpack with a snowball. 

“Dad!” Nicole cried. “Jordan hit me with a snowball!” 

Dad had his camera in front of his face, clicking away, as usual. “Good for 
you, Nicole,” he said absently. Nicole rolled her eyes. 

Then she ripped off my ski cap. She stuffed it with snow and smushed it on 
top of my head. 

Snow trickled down my face. The cold burned my skin. 

At first I thought snow was cool. I could mush it up in my hand to make 
snowballs. Fall down in it without getting hurt. Put it on my tongue and let it 
melt into water. 

But I was beginning to feel the cold. My toes and fingers were getting 
numb. We had already walked two miles out of town. When I looked back, I 
couldn’t see it. I could only see snow and sky. 

Only eight more miles to the cabin, I thought, wiggling my fingers inside 
my mittens. Eight more miles! It was going to take forever. And all around us, 
nothing but snow—miles and miles of it. 

Dad and Arthur trudged beside the dogsled. Arthur had brought along four 
Alaskan huskies—Binko, Rocky, Tin-tin, and Nicole’s favorite, Lars. They 
pulled Dad’s big trunk and the other supplies in a long, narrow sled. 

Nicole and I each carried a backpack filled with emergency food and other 
supplies. Just in case, Dad said. 

In case of what? I wondered. In case we get lost? In case the dogs run away 
with the sled? In case the Abominable Snowman captures us? 

Dad snapped pictures of the dogs, of us, of Arthur, of the snow. 

Nicole threw herself backwards into a snowdrift. “Look—an angel!” she 
cried, waving her arms up and down. 

She jumped up and we checked out the snow angel. “Cool,” I admitted. I 
lay on my back to make one, too. When Nicole came closer to inspect it, I 
whopped her with a snowball. 

“Hey!” she cried. “I’m going to get you for that!” 

I leaped up and darted away. The deep snow crunched under my shoes. 



Nicole ran after me. We raced ahead of the dogsled. 

“Be careful, kids!” Dad called after us. “Stay out of trouble!” 

I stumbled in the snow. Nicole pounced on me. I wriggled free and bolted 
away. 

What kind of trouble could we get into? I thought as my feet crunched 
along. There’s nothing but snow for miles around. We couldn’t even get lost out 
here! 

I turned around and ran backwards, waving at Nicole. “Try and catch me, 
Miss Factoid!” I teased. 

“Name-calling is so immature!” she yelled, chasing after me. 

Then she stopped and pointed behind me. “Jordan! Look out!” 

“Hey—I’m not falling for that old trick,” I called back. I skipped backwards 
through the snow. I didn’t want to take my eyes off her, in case she planned to 
pelt me with snowballs. 

“Jordan, I mean it!” she screamed. “Stop!”

Thud! 

I landed hard on my back in a pile of snow. “Unh!” I grunted, stunned. 

I struggled to catch my breath. Then I stared around me. 

I had fallen down some kind of deep crevasse. I sat shivering in the pile of 
snow, surrounded by narrow cliffs of bluish ice and rock. 

I stood and looked up. The opening of the crevasse was at least twenty feet 
above me. Frantically, I clutched at the icy walls. I grabbed onto a jutting rock 
and fumbled for a foothold, hoping to climb out. 

I hoisted myself up a couple of feet. Then my hand slipped and I slid back 
to the bottom. I tried again. The ice was too slick. 

How would I ever get out of here? 

Where were Dad and Nicole? I tried to warm my cheeks with my mittens. 
Why don’t they come to get me? I’m going to freeze down here! 

Nicole’s face appeared at the top of the crevasse. I’d never been so happy to 
see her in my life. 

“Jordan? Are you all right?” 

“Get me out of here!” I shouted. 

“Don’t worry,” Nicole assured me. “Dad’s coming.” 

I leaned against the pit wall. The sunlight didn’t reach the bottom. My toes 
felt ready to break off. They were so cold! I jumped up and down to keep warm. 

A few minutes later, I heard Dad’s voice. “Jordan? Are you hurt?” 

“No, Dad!” I called up to him. He, Nicole, and Arthur all stared down at me 
from above. 

“Arthur is going to lower a rope down to you,” Dad instructed. “Hold on to 
it, and we’ll hoist you out of there.” 

I stepped aside as Arthur tossed one end of a knotted rope into the crevasse. 
I clutched the rope with my mittened hands. 

Arthur shouted, “Heave! ” 

Dad and Arthur tugged on the rope. I planted my feet in footholds in the 
ice, bracing myself against the side of the crevasse. The rope slipped out of my 
hands. I clutched it tighter. 

“Hold on, Jordan!” Dad called. 



They pulled again. My arms felt as if they were going to be yanked out of 
their sockets. “Ow!” I cried. “Careful!” 

Slowly they hoisted me to the top of the crevasse. I wasn’t much help—my 
feet kept slipping on the icy walls. Dad and Arthur each took one of my hands 
and dragged me out of the pit. 

I lay on the snow, trying to catch my breath. 

Dad tested my arms and legs for sprains and breaks. “You sure you’re all 
right?” he asked. 

I nodded. 

“It was a mistake to haul kids along,” Arthur grumbled. “The snow is not as 
solid as it looks, you know. If we hadn’t seen you fall, we never would have 
found you.” 

“We’ve got to be more careful,” Dad agreed. “I want you both to stick close 
to the sled.” He leaned over the side of the crevasse and snapped a picture. 

I stood up and brushed the snow from the seat of my pants. “I’ll be careful 
from now on,” I promised. 

“Good,” Dad said. 

“We’d better push on,” Arthur said. 

We started walking again across the snow. I gave Nicole a shove once in a 
while, and she shoved me back. But we were quieter now. Neither of us wanted 
to end up frozen to death at the bottom of a snow hole. 

Dad snapped away as we walked. “How much farther to the cabin?” he 
asked Arthur. 

“Another couple of miles,” Arthur replied. He pointed to a steep mountain 
of snow in the distance. “See that snow rise, about ten miles off? That’s where 
the monster was last spotted.” 

The Abominable Snowman had been seen by that snow rise, I thought. 
Where was he now? 

Could he see us coming? Was he hiding somewhere, watching us? 

I kept my eyes on the snow rise as we walked. It seemed to grow bigger as we 
came closer to it. The snow rise was dotted with pine trees and boulders. 

After about an hour, a tiny brown speck appeared a mile or so away. 

“That’s the abandoned musher’s cabin where we’ll stop for the night,” Dad 
explained. He rubbed his gloves together and added, “It sure will be nice to sit 
by a roaring fire.” 



I clapped my mittens together to keep the blood flowing through my hands. 
“I can’t wait,” I agreed. “It must be minus two thousand degrees out here!” 

“Actually, it’s about minus ten,” Nicole stated. “At least, that’s the average 
temperature for this area at this time of year.” 

“Thank you, Weather Girl,” I joked. “And now for sports. Arthur?” 

Arthur frowned into his beard. I guess he didn’t get the joke. 

He fell behind us a little to check the back of the sled. Dad turned around to 
snap Arthur’s picture. 

“When we get to the musher’s cabin I’ll take a few more scenery photos,” 
Dad said, as he changed his film. “Maybe I’ll photograph the cabin, too. Then 
we’ll all turn in. We have a big day tomorrow.” 

By the time we reached the cabin it was almost eight o’clock at night. 

“Took us too long to get here,” Arthur grumbled. “We left town after lunch. 
It should’ve taken us about five hours. The kids having accidents and all is 
slowing us down.” 

Dad stood a few feet away from him, shooting a portrait of Arthur while he 
talked. 

“Mr. Blake, did you hear me?” Arthur growled. “Stop taking my picture!” 

“What?” Dad said, letting his camera drop to his chest. “Oh, yeah—the 
kids. Bet they’re hungry.” 

I explored the musher’s cabin. It didn’t take long. The tiny wooden shack 
was empty except for an old wood-burning stove and a couple of broken-down 
cots. 

“Why is the cabin so empty?” Nicole asked. 

“Mushers don’t stop here anymore,” Arthur explained. “They’re afraid of 
the monster.” 

I didn’t like the sound of that. I glanced at Nicole. She rolled her eyes. 

Arthur bedded the dogs in a lean-to outside the cabin. The lean-to was a 
shed built against the back cabin wall. It was filled with straw for the dogs to 
sleep on. I spotted a rusty old dogsled propped in a corner. 

Then Arthur lit a fire and began to fix some supper. 

“Tomorrow we’ll search for this so-called monster,” Dad announced. 
“Everybody get a good night’s sleep.” 

After supper we crawled into our sleeping bags. I lay awake for a long time, 
listening to the howling wind outside. Listening for the thudding footsteps of an 
Abominable Snowman. 



“Nicole, get off me!” She rolled over in her sleeping bag and jabbed her elbow 
into my ribs. I knocked her arm away and snuggled deeper inside my own toasty 
warm sleeping bag. 

Nicole opened her eyes. Bright morning sunshine streamed into the cabin. 

“I’ll be back in a minute to fix breakfast, kids,” Dad said. He sat in a chair, 
lacing up his snow boots. “First I’m going out to check on the dogs. Arthur went 
out to feed them a few minutes ago.” 

He bundled up and stepped outside. I rubbed my nose—it was cold. The 
fire in the stove had gone out during the night. No one had relit it yet. 

I forced myself to climb out of my sleeping bag and start pulling on clothes. 
Nicole began dressing, too. 

“Do you think there’s a hot shower in this dump?” I wondered aloud. 

Nicole smirked at me. “You know perfectly well there’s no hot shower, 
Jordan.” 

“Oh, wow! This is incredible!” I heard Dad’s shout from outside. 

I jammed my feet into my boots and raced out the door. Nicole pushed right 
behind me. 

Dad stood at the side of the musher’s cabin, pointing in shock at the ground. 

I gazed down—and saw deep footprints in the snow. Huge footprints. 
Enormous footprints. 

So big that only a monster could have made them. 



10 


“Unbelievable,” Dad murmured, staring at the snow. 

Arthur hurried over from the lean-to. He stopped when he saw the prints. 

“No!” he cried. “He was here!” 

His ruddy face grew pale. His jaw trembled with terror. 

“We’ve got to get away from here—now!” he said to Dad in a low, 
frightened voice. 

Dad tried to calm him down. “Hold on a minute. Let’s not jump to 
conclusions.” 

“We’re in terrible danger!” Arthur insisted. “The monster is nearby! He’ll 
rip us all to shreds!” 

Nicole knelt in the snow, studying the footprints. “Do you think they’re 
real?” she asked. “Real Abominable Snowman footprints?” 

She thinks they’re real, I thought. She believes. 

Dad knelt beside her. “They look pretty real to me.” 

Then I saw a light glimmer in his eyes. He lifted his head and squinted at 
me suspiciously. 

I backed away. 

“Jordan!” Nicole cried in an accusing voice. 

I couldn’t help it. I started laughing. 

Dad shook his head. “Jordan. I should’ve known.” 

“What?” Arthur looked confused—and then angry. “You mean the kid 
made these prints? It’s a joke?” 

“I’m afraid so, Arthur,” Dad sighed. 

Arthur scowled at me. Beneath his beard, his face reddened to the color of a 
slab of raw steak. 

I cowered. I couldn’t help it. Arthur scared me. He sure didn’t like kids— 
especially not kids who play jokes. 

“I’ve got work to do,” Arthur muttered. He turned and stomped away 
through the snow. 

“Jordan, you crumb,” Nicole said. “When did you do it?” 

“I woke up early this morning and sneaked out,” I admitted. “You were all 



sleeping. I carved the footprints over my own prints, with my mittens. Then I 
stepped in the prints on my way back, to cover my tracks. 

“You believed,” I added, jabbing a finger at Nicole. “For a minute there, 
you believed in the snow monster.” 

“I did not!” Nicole protested. 

“Yes, you did. I got you to believe!” 

I glanced from Nicole’s peevish face to Dad’s stern one. “Don’t you think 
it’s funny?” I asked. “It’s just a joke!” 

Usually Dad liked my jokes. 

Not this time. 

“Jordan, we’re not at home in Pasadena now. We’re out in the middle of 
nowhere. The wilds of Alaska. Things could get very dangerous. You saw that 
yesterday when you fell down the crevasse.” 

I nodded and hung my head. 

“I’m serious, Jordan,” Dad warned me. “No more practical jokes. I’m here 
to work. And I don’t want anything to happen to you, or Nicole, or any of us. 
Understood?” 

“Yes, Dad.” 

No one said anything for a minute. Then Dad patted me on the back. “Okay, 
then. Let’s go inside and get some breakfast.” 

Arthur returned to the cabin a few minutes later. He stamped the snow off 
his boots, glaring at me. 

“You think you’re funny,” he muttered. “But wait till you see the snowman. 
Will you be laughing then?” 

I swallowed hard. 

The answer to his question was no. Definitely no. 



11 


After breakfast we hitched the dogs to the sled and set off for the snow rise. 
Arthur wouldn’t talk to me and would hardly look at me. I guess he was angry 
about my joke. 

Everybody else has forgiven me, I thought. Why won’t he? 

Nicole and I walked at the front of the sled with the dogs. Behind me I 
heard Dad’s camera clicking furiously. I knew that meant he’d found something 
good to photograph. I turned around. 

A large herd of elk moved toward us, toward the snow rise. We stopped to 
watch them. 

“Look at them,” Dad whispered. “Amazing.” He quickly loaded new film 
into his camera and started snapping away again. 

The elk calmly picked their way across the snow, antlers high. They 
stopped to eat at a stand of bushes. Arthur pulled back the rein on the lead sled 
dog to keep him from barking. 

Suddenly, one elk lifted its head. It seemed to sense something. 

The other elk tensed up, too. Then they turned and began to gallop away 
across the tundra. Their hooves thundered over the snow. 

Dad let his camera fall against his chest. “That’s strange,” he said. “I 
wonder what happened.” 

“Something scared them,” Arthur said grimly. “It wasn’t us. And it wasn’t 
the dogs.” 

Dad scanned the horizon. “What was it, then?” 

We all waited for Arthur’s answer. But he only said, “We ought to turn 
around and head back to town right now.” 

“We’re not going back,” Dad insisted. “Not after coming all this way.” 

Arthur stared at him. “Are you going to take my advice or not?” 

“No,” Dad replied. “I’ve got a job to do here. And I’ve hired you to do a 
job. We’re not going back without a good reason.” 

“We’ve got a good reason,” Arthur insisted. “Only you won’t see it that 
way.” 

“Push ahead,” Dad ordered. 

Arthur frowned and shouted “Mush!” to the dogs. The sled began to move. 



We followed it, on toward the snow rise. 

Nicole walked a few feet ahead of me. I picked up a pile of snow and patted 
it into a ball. But then I thought I’d better not throw it. No one seemed to be in 
the mood for snowball fights. 

We marched through the snow for a couple of hours. I slipped off my 
mittens and wiggled my fingers. Frost kept collecting on my upper lip. I wiped it 
away. 

We reached a stand of pine trees at the base of the snow rise. Suddenly the 
dogs stopped short. They began to bark. 

“Mush!” Arthur shouted. 

The dogs refused to go farther. 

Nicole ran up to her favorite dog, Lars. “What is it, Lars? What’s the 
matter?” 

Lars howled. 

“What’s wrong with them?” Dad asked Arthur. 

Arthur’s face paled again. His hands shook. He stared intently into the trees, 
squinting into the brightness. 

“Something’s frightened the dogs,” he said. “Look how their fur stands on 
end.” 

I patted Lars. It was true. His fur stood straight up. The dog growled. 

“Not much scares these dogs,” Arthur said. “Whatever it is, it’s scaring 
them bad.” 

The dogs all howled. 

Nicole huddled close to Dad. 

“There’s something dangerous on that snow rise,” Arthur said. “Something 
dangerous—and very near.” 



12 


“I’m warning you, Mr. Blake,” Arthur said. “We’ve got to go back.” 

“No way,” Dad protested. “We’re not going back. I mean it.” 

The dogs barked and skittered nervously. Arthur shook his head. “I won’t 
go any farther. The dogs won’t, either.” 

Dad shouted, “Mush!” to the dogs. They howled and started backing up. 

“Mush!” he cried again. Instead of going forward, the dogs tried to turn 
around in the snow. 

“You’re upsetting them,” Arthur said. “They won’t go any farther—I told 
you that. 

“If we turn around now,” Arthur added, “we can make it back to the cabin 
before it gets too late.” 

“What are we going to do, Dad?” I asked. 

Dad frowned. “Maybe Arthur’s right. Something is definitely frightening 
the dogs. There could be a bear or something nearby.” 

“Not a bear, Mr. Blake,” Arthur insisted. “These dogs are spooked. And so 
am I.” 

He marched away across the snow, heading back toward the musher’s 
cabin. 

“Arthur!” Dad called. “Come back here!” 

Arthur didn’t turn around. He didn’t say a word. He just kept walking. 

He must be really scared, I thought. And that sent a chill of fear down my 
back. 

Still barking excitedly, the dogs pulled the sled around and started 
following Arthur. 

Dad peered into the woods. “I wish I could see what’s out there.” 

“Let’s go check it out,” I urged. “Whatever it is, it’ll probably make a great 
photo.” That usually gets Dad. 

He glanced back at Arthur, the dogs, and the sled, rushing toward the cabin. 
“No—it’s too dangerous. We have no choice. Let’s go, kids.” 

We trudged back to the cabin. “Maybe I can persuade Arthur to push on 
tomorrow,” Dad muttered. 

I didn’t say anything. But I had a feeling it wouldn’t be easy to get Arthur 



to climb that snow rise. 

And maybe Arthur was right, I thought. Those dogs really were scared. It 
was definitely creepy. 

Arthur was unhitching the dogs from the sled when we reached the cabin. 
The dogs had calmed down a lot. 

I yanked off my backpack and collapsed on top of my sleeping bag. 

“We might as well eat supper,” Dad grumbled. I could tell he was in a 
terrible mood. “Jordan—why don’t you and Nicole go gather some firewood. 
But be careful.” 

“We will, Dad,” Nicole promised. 

I stood up and started out of the cabin. 

“Jordan!” Dad scolded. “Put your knapsack back on. I don’t want you going 
anywhere without it. Understood?” 

“We’re just going for firewood,” I protested. “I’m tired of carrying it. We’ll 
only be gone for a few minutes—and anyway, Nicole is wearing hers.” 

“No arguments,” Dad snapped. “If you get lost, that food could keep you 
alive until we find you. You leave this cabin, you wear that backpack. Is that 
clear?” 

Boy, was he in a bad mood. “It’s clear,” I said, strapping on my pack. 

Nicole and I crunched across the snow to the nearest trees. They lined a 
snow ridge about half a mile away. 

We climbed the snow ridge. I made it to the top first. 

“Nicole—look!” 

On the other side of the snow ridge, I saw a frozen stream. The first water 
we’d seen since we’d set out. 

Nicole and I skittered down the ridge and stared into the icy stream. I tested 
the ice with my foot. 

“Don’t step on it, Jordan!” Nicole cried. “You might fall in.” 

I tapped the ice with the tip of my boot. “It’s solid,” I told her. 

“Still,” Nicole said. “Don’t take any chances. Dad will kill you if you have 
another accident.” 

“I wonder if there are fish swimming under there,” I said, staring into the 
ice. 

“We should tell Dad about this,” Nicole said. “He might want to photograph 
it.” 

We left the stream to gather dead branches under the trees. We lugged them 



over the snow ridge and back across the snow to the cabin. 

“Thanks, kids,” Dad said when we burst into the cabin. He took the wood 
from us and started a fire in the stove. “How about pancakes for supper tonight?” 

He’s in a better mood now, I thought with relief. 

Nicole told Dad about the frozen stream. 

“Interesting,” Dad said. “I’ll go take a look at it after supper. I’ve got to find 
something to photograph besides all this ice and snow.” 

The pancakes cheered all of us up—except for Arthur. 

He ate a lot, but he didn’t say much. He appeared jittery. He dropped his 
fork on the floor. Muttering to himself, he picked it up and started eating without 
wiping it off. 

When supper was over, Nicole and I helped Dad clean up. 

We were gathering up the supplies when the dogs started to bark. 

I saw Arthur freeze. 

“What’s that?” I cried. “What’s upset the dogs?” 



13 


The dogs yelped and barked. 

Was someone out there? 

An animal? A monster? 

“I’ll go check,” Arthur said solemnly. He pulled on his coat and wool cap 
and hurried out of the cabin. 

Dad grabbed his coat. “Stay here,” he instructed Nicole and me. He 
followed Arthur. 

We stared at each other, listening to the yelping dogs. A few seconds later, 
the barking stopped. 

Dad poked his head back into the cabin. “Nothing out there. We don’t know 
what got them upset. But Arthur is calming them down.” 

Dad grabbed his camera. “You two get some sleep, okay? I’m going to 
check out that stream. I won’t be gone long.” 

He draped the camera over his fur coat collar. The cabin door slammed 
behind him. 

We heard Dad’s footsteps crunching over the snow. Then silence. Nicole 
and I climbed into our sleeping bags. 

I rolled onto my side, trying to get comfortable. It was after eight o’clock, 
but still light outside. The sun filtered through the window of the cabin. 

The light reminded me of when I was little. Mom used to try to make me 
take a nap in the afternoon. I never could sleep in the daytime. 

I closed my eyes. I opened them. I wasn’t sleepy. 

I turned my head and glanced at Nicole. She lay on her back, her eyes wide 
open. 

“I can’t sleep,” I announced. 

“Me either,” she replied. 

I squirmed in my sleeping bag. 

“Where’s Arthur?” Nicole asked. “I wonder what’s taking him so long?” 

“I guess he’s hanging out with the dogs,” I said. “I think he likes them 
better than he likes us.” 

“That’s for sure,” Nicole agreed. 



We tossed and turned some more. The sky stayed bright. The light poured 
in through the cabin window. 

“I give up,” I groaned. “Let’s go outside and build a snowman or 
something.” 

“Dad said to stay put.” 

“We won’t go anywhere. We’ll stay by the cabin,” I assured her. 

I crawled out of my sleeping bag and started getting dressed. Nicole sat up. 
“We shouldn’t,” she warned. 

“Come on. What could happen?” 

She stood up and pulled on her sweater. “If I don’t do something, I’ll go 
stir-crazy,” she admitted. 

We bundled up. I pulled open the cabin door. 

“Jordan—wait!” Nicole cried. “You forgot your backpack.” 

“We’re just going out the door,” I complained. 

“Come on. Dad said we have to. He’ll be furious if he finds us outside. And 
he’ll be even more furious if you’re not wearing your pack.” 

“Oh, all right,” I grumbled. I hoisted the pack over my shoulders. “Like 
something’s really going to happen to us.” 

We stepped out into the cold. I kicked at the snow. 

Nicole grabbed my coat sleeve. “Listen!” she whispered. 

We heard the crunch of footsteps behind the cabin. “It’s Arthur,” I told her. 
We crept around to the back. It was Arthur. 

He crouched beside the dogsled, hitching up one of the dogs. Two others 
were already tied to the sled. 

“Arthur!” I cried. “What’s up?” 

Startled, he turned to us. He didn’t reply. Instead, he jumped on the back of 
the sled. 

“Mush!” he commanded the dogs at the top of his lungs. 

The dogs leaned forward, tugging hard. The sled began to slide away. 
“Arthur! Where are you going?” I screamed. “Come back!” 

The sled picked up speed. 

“Arthur! Arthur!” Nicole and I ran after him, shouting his name. 

But the sled raced farther and farther away from us. 

Arthur never turned back. 



14 


Nicole and I chased after the sled, watching it grow tinier and tinier. 

“Arthur! Come back!” 

“He’s got our food!” I cried. 

We couldn’t let him get away. We ran as fast as we could, our boots falling 
deep into the snow. 

The sled climbed over a tall ridge of snow. 

“Stop! Stop!” Nicole screamed. “Please!” 

“We can’t keep up with the dogs,” I gasped. 

“We have to try,” Nicole cried frantically. “We can’t let Arthur leave us 
here!” 

The sled disappeared over the top of the ridge. We clawed our way up. The 
snow slid under our feet. 

By the time we reached the top, Arthur and the dogs were far ahead of us. 
We watched in horror as they quickly disappeared across the tundra. 

Exhausted, I collapsed in the snow. “They’re getting away,” I choked out. 

“Jordan, get up!” Nicole pleaded. 

“We can’t catch him,” I moaned. 

Then Nicole said in a small voice, “Where are we?” 

I stood up and gazed around. Snow, snow, snow. All around us, nothing but 
snow. No landmarks. No sign of the cabin. 

Clouds had covered the sun. The wind picked up. Snow began to fall. 

I had no idea where we were. 

“Which way is the cabin?” I asked in a shrill voice. “Which way did we 
come?” 

We scanned the horizon through the falling snow. I didn’t see the cabin 
anywhere. 

Nicole tugged on my arm. “The cabin is that way. Let’s go!” 

“No!” The snow came down harder and faster, stinging my eyes. I shouted 
into the wind. “The cabin’s the other way! That’s not the way we came.” 

“Look!” Nicole yelled, pointing down. “Our tracks! We’ll just follow them 
home.” 



We started down the ridge, following the ruts we’d made in the snow. The 
wind howled, growing stronger. 

We followed our own footprints for a short while. It was so hard to see in 
the falling snow. All white and gray. The whole world. White and gray. 

Nicole peered at me through the thick curtain of snow. “I can hardly see 
you!” she shouted. 

We crouched low, searching for our footprints. 

“They’re gone!” I cried. The snow had already covered them up. 

Nicole clutched my arm. “Jordan, I’m getting scared.” 

I was getting scared, too. But I didn’t tell Nicole. 

“We’ll find the cabin,” I assured her. “Don’t worry. I bet Dad’s looking for 
us right now.” 

I wished I believed it myself. The wind pelted us with hard, icy snow. I 
squinted into the wind. Nothing but white. White on white. White on gray. 

“Don’t let go of me!” I shouted to Nicole. 

“What?” 

“I said, don’t let go of me! We could easily lose each other in the storm!” 

She tightened her grip on my arm to show she understood. 

“I’m so cold,” she shouted. “Let’s run!” 

We tried to run through the snow, stumbling against the wind. “Dad!” we 
called out. “Dad!” 

I had no idea where we were going—but I knew we had to go somewhere. 

“Look!” Nicole cried, pointing through the thick snow. “I think I see 
something!” 

I stared as hard as I could, but I didn’t see anything. 

Nicole pulled me along. “Come on!” she shouted. 

We ran blindly. Suddenly, the ground gave way under our feet. 

Still holding onto Nicole, I felt myself being sucked down under the snow. 



15 


Down we fell. Down into the freezing white. 

The snow rushed up, swirled around us. 

And buried us. 

Another crevasse, I thought. Another deep pit in the snow. 

Much deeper than the first. 

We both cried out as we landed. Tangled up in each other. 

“Get off!” Nicole shrieked. “Where are we? Get off!” 

Feeling dazed, I struggled to my feet. Then I grabbed both of her hands and 
tugged her up. 

“Oh no,” Nicole groaned. 

We both stared up to the top. I could barely make out the gray of the sky, 
high above our heads. 

And all around us, high walls of snow. Powdery snow that blew down on 
us. I peered up to the top of the pit. Chunks of snow broke off the icy walls. 
They made soft thuds as they landed beside us on the snowy pit floor. 

“We’re trapped down here!” Nicole wailed. “Dad will never find us. 
Never!” 

I grabbed the shoulders of her coat. A chunk of snow fell off the pit wall 
and landed on top of my boots. “Try to stay calm,” I told her. But my voice 
trembled as I said it. 

“Calm? How can I stay calm?” she demanded shrilly. 

“Dad will find us,” I said. I wasn’t sure I believed it. I swallowed hard, 
trying to fight down my panic. 

“Daaaaaad!” Nicole screamed. She cupped her hands around her mouth, 
raised her head toward the sky, and screamed at the top of her lungs. 
“Daaaaaaad! Daaaaaaaaad!” 

I clapped a mitten over her mouth. 

Too late. 

I heard a low rumbling. 

The rumbling became a roar as the snow walls began to crack and crumble. 

Crumble down. Down on us. 



Trembling in horror, I knew what was happening. 
Nicole had started an avalanche. 



16 


As sheets of snow tumbled down on us, I grabbed Nicole. 

I pushed her against the pit wall. Then I flattened myself against the wall, 

too. 

The snow roared down. 

I pressed myself tight against the wall—and to my shock, the wall gave 

way! 

“Ooooh!” I let out a startled cry. Nicole and I tumbled through the side of 
the pit. 

We stumbled forward into total darkness. 

I heard a crash behind us. My heart pounding, I turned in time to see the pit 
fill up. Snow piled over the opening in the wall. 

Nicole and I were sealed in. Shut in this dark hole. 

Our way out was gone. The pit was gone. 

We crouched in the dark tunnel-like opening, trembling, gasping in fright. 
“Where are we?” Nicole choked out. “What do we do now?” 

“I don’t know.” I grabbed the wall. We seemed to be in a narrow 
passageway. The walls around us were made of rock instead of snow. 

My eyes adjusted to the darkness. I could see a dim light at the end of the 
passageway. 

“Let’s see what’s down there,” I urged Nicole. 

We crawled on our hands and knees through the passage toward the light. 
The passage ended. We stood up. 

We found ourselves in a big cave. The top of the cave towered high above 
our heads. Water trickled slowly down one of the walls. A dim glow came from 
somewhere near the back. 

“The light must be coming from outside,” Nicole said. “That means there’s 
a way out of here.” 

We crept slowly through the cave. The only sound I could hear was the 
drip, drip, drip of melting icicles. 

Soon we’ll be out of here, I thought. “Jordan,” she whispered. “Look!” 

On the floor of the cave I could make out a footprint. A gigantic footprint. 
Bigger than the fake one I’d made in the snow that morning. 



Five of my shoes could fit inside that footprint. 

I took a few steps—and saw another footprint. 

Nicole grabbed my arm. 

“Do you think it’s...?” She stopped. 

I knew what she was thinking. 

We traced the giant footprints across the cave floor. They led us straight to a 
shadowy corner in the back—and stopped. 

I glanced up. 

Nicole gasped. 

We both saw it at the same time. 

The creature. 

The Abominable Snowman! 

He loomed over us. 

He stood upright like a human, covered in brown fur. Black eyes stared out 
of an ugly face, half-human, half-gorilla. 

He wasn’t that tall—about a head taller than me—but he seemed huge. His 
body was thick and powerful, with gigantic feet and fur-covered hands—as big 
as baseball gloves. 

“We’re t-trapped!” Nicole stammered. 

She was right. 

The entrance behind us had been blocked by the avalanche. There was no 
way we could slip past this giant creature. 

No way. 

The Abominable Snowman glared down at us. Then it started to move. 



17 


My teeth began to chatter. 

I squeezed my eyes shut and trembled, waiting for the monster to grab us. 

A second passed. Then another. 

Nothing happened. 

I opened my eyes. The snowman hadn’t moved. 

Nicole took a step forward. “He’s frozen!” she cried. 

I blinked in the dim light. “Huh?” It was true. The snowman stood frozen in 
a huge block of clear ice. 

I touched the ice. The monster stood inside it like a statue. 

“If he’s frozen in ice,” I wondered, “then what made those giant 
footprints?” 

Nicole bent down to study the prints. She shuddered again at their huge 

size. 

“They lead right to the block of ice,” she declared. “The snowman must 
have made them somehow.” 

“Maybe he walked back here and accidently froze,” I suggested. I touched 
the back wall of the cave, where icy water dripped from above. 

“Or maybe he goes into the ice to rest,” I added. “Like Dracula going to 
sleep in his coffin at dawn.” 

I backed away. It was too frightening, being this close to him. But the 
monster stayed perfectly still under the thick ice. 

Nicole leaned close to the ice. “Look at his hands!” she cried. “Or paws, or 
whatever.” 

Like the rest of his body, his hands were covered with brown fur. He had 
thick fingers, like a man’s. Jutting out of them were long, sharp claws. 

A chill ran down my spine at the sight of those claws. What did he use them 
for? Ripping wild animals to pieces? Tearing up people who got in his way? 

He had powerful legs, with shorter claws on his toes. I studied his face. Fur 
covered his whole head, except for a circle of hairless skin around his eyes, nose, 
and mouth. The skin was a pinkish red. His lips were thick and white and set in a 
mean-looking grimace. 

“He’s definitely a mammal,” Nicole declared. “The fur is a dead giveaway.” 



I rolled my eyes. “This is no time for biology lessons, Nicole. Wait until 
Dad sees this. He’ll go crazy! If he can get a picture of this, he’ll be famous!” 

“Yeah,” Nicole sighed. “If we can find Dad. If we ever get out of here.” 

“There’s got to be a way out,” I said. I moved to a side wall and pressed it 
with my hands, searching for a hole, a chink in the rock, anything. 

After a few minutes I found a tiny crack. “Nicole!” I cried. “I found 
something!” 

She raced to my side. I pointed out the crack in the cave wall. She frowned 
with disappointment. 

“That’s just a crack,” she said. 

“You don’t know everything,” I protested. “Maybe there’s a secret door 
here. A hidden passage. Or something.” 

She sighed. “I guess it’s worth a shot.” 

We pressed on the crack. We stuck our fingers into it. We kicked it. I even 
tried karate-chopping it. 

Nothing. 

“I hate to break this to you, Jordan,” she said. “But I was right. As always. 
All you found was a crack in the wall.” 

“Well, keep looking,” I snarled. “We’ve got to get out of here!” 

I kept searching. I ran my hands along the wall, my back to the monster. 

Suddenly I heard a noise. A loud crack! 

“Nicole!” I cried. “Did you find something?” 

I whirled around. I realized Nicole hadn’t made that sound. She stared at the 
monster in horror. 

“What?” I asked her. “What’s wrong?” 

I heard another crack! 

“The ice is cracking!” Nicole screamed. “The monster—he’s breaking out!” 



18 


Crack! 

The block of ice splintered apart. Nicole and I pressed ourselves against a 
wall, watching in horror. 

The Abominable Snowman burst from the ice. Chunks of ice smashed on 
the floor and shattered like glass. The snowman shook himself, growling like a 
wolf. 

“Run!” I screamed. 

Nicole and I took off. But there was nowhere to go. We scrambled to the 
other side of the cave—as far away from the monster as we could get. 

“The passageway!” I cried. I ducked down and started to crawl through the 
passage. 

Nicole grabbed me. 

“Wait! It’s blocked! The avalanche—remember?” 

Yes. Of course. The way out of the cave was blocked by tons of snow. 

Across the cave, the monster uttered a ferocious roar that shook the walls. 

Nicole and I cowered in a corner of the cave. I felt her trembling next to 
me. 

“Maybe he didn’t see us,” I whispered. 

“Then why is he roaring?” Nicole whispered back. 

The monster twitched his gorilla nose in the air, sniffing. 

Oh, no! I thought. Can he smell us from across the cave? 

He turned his huge, furry head one way and then the other. 

He’s searching for us, I realized. He smells us. 

“Unh!” he grunted. He stared into a corner of the cave—our corner of the 

cave. 

“Unh!” he grunted again. 

“Oh, no!” Nicole moaned. “He sees us!” 

The big creature staggered toward us, grunting with each heavy step. 

I pressed myself against the cave wall, wishing the cave would swallow us 
up. 

Anything would be better than having him swallow us! 



The monster kept coming. His footsteps shook the floor of the cave. Boom, 
boom, boom. 

We huddled on the floor. We tried to make ourselves as small as we could. 
He stopped inches in front of us and roared again. A deafening roar. 

“His teeth!” Nicole cried. 

I saw them, too. Two rows of huge, razor-sharp teeth. 

The monster growled. 

And reached for us. His sharp claws flashed. 

He swiped at me. I tried to duck away. 

The monster snarled in frustration. He reached out again.... 

He clamped a powerful paw on Nicole’s head. 

“Help!” Nicole screamed. “He’s crushing me!” 



19 


“Let go of her!” I shrieked. 

But I knew I was helpless. 

The Abominable Snowman growled and turned Nicole around roughly. 

Then he reached behind her and grabbed her backpack. He ripped it off her 
shoulder with a sharp, hard tug. 

“Hey!” I cried in horror. 

With one claw he sliced open the canvas backpack. He reached inside. And 
pulled something out. 

A bag. A bag of trail mix. 

Nicole and I stared in amazement as he poured the trail mix into his mouth. 

“Weird,” I choked out. “He likes trail mix.” 

The monster crumpled up the bag and shifted through Nicole’s pack, 
searching for more. 

“That’s all there is,” Nicole whispered to me. 

With an angry growl, the monster tossed Nicole’s pack away. 

“Now what?” Nicole whispered. 

I reached into my own backpack, and with a trembling hand I yanked out 
my bag of trail mix. I heaved it at the monster. 

The bag hit the floor and slid to the monster’s feet. He bent down. Grabbed 
it. Tore it open. And hungrily gulped down the trail mix. 

When he finished, I shoved my pack toward him. 

He grunted. Then he dumped out my stuff. 

No more trail mix. 

Uh-oh. 

The monster stretched and roared. Then he reached down. With two 
gigantic arms, he grabbed Nicole and me. 

He lifted us up. 

He raised us toward his face. 

Toward his mouth. 

Preparing to eat us. 



20 


I struggled, but he was too strong. I pounded my fists on his chest. I kicked as 
hard as I could. He didn’t seem to feel it. 

He clutched Nicole and me like a couple of dolls. 

“Please don’t eat us!” I begged. “Please!” 

The monster grunted. He draped us both over the crook of one arm. Then he 
staggered back across the cave, gripping us tightly. 

I kicked him in the side. No reaction. Nothing. 

“Let go!” I shrieked. “Let us down!” 

“Where’s he taking us?” Nicole cried, bouncing as the creature tromped 
across the cave. 

Maybe he wants to roast us, I thought grimly. Maybe he doesn’t like his 
kids raw. 

He lugged us to the back of the cave. With one powerful swipe of the paw, 
he knocked a boulder aside. A narrow passage appeared behind it. 

Nicole moaned. “Why didn’t we see that before? Maybe we could have 
escaped!” 

“Too late now,” I groaned. 

The snowman pulled us through the passage. We came out into a smaller 
cave, flooded with light. I glanced up. 

Above us I could see the gray sky. 

Away out! 

Balancing us in one arm, the monster scaled the wall of the cave. With big, 
lurching steps, he climbed out of the hole. 

Cold air blasted me in the face. But the monster’s body pulsed with heat. 

The blizzard had stopped. Fresh snow covered the tundra. 

The monster stumbled through the snow, grunting as he walked. 

His gigantic feet sank deep into the snow. But with each huge step he 
covered a lot of ground. 

Where was he taking us? Where? 

Maybe he has another cave, I thought with a shudder. A cave with more 
monsters in it. His friends. They’ll all feast on us! 



I tried again to break out of the snowman’s grip. I kicked and squirmed as 
hard as I could. 

The monster growled. He dug his claws into my side. 

“Ow!” I yelped. But I stopped squirming. If I moved, his claws dug deeper. 
Poor Dad, I thought sadly. He’ll never know what happened to us. 

Unless he finds our bones buried in the snow. 

Suddenly, I heard barking. A dog! 

The Abominable Snowman stopped. He growled and sniffed the air. Then 
he gently dropped Nicole and me in the snow. 

We landed unsteadily on our feet. 

Nicole stared at me in surprise. 

We started to run, stumbling through the deep snow. I glanced back. 

“Is he chasing us?” Nicole asked. 

I couldn’t be sure. I couldn’t see him now. I only saw white. 

“Keep running!” I shouted. 

Then I saw something familiar in the distance. A brown speck. 

I bumped Nicole. “The cabin!” 

We ran even faster. If we could just get to the cabin... 

From the cabin we heard furious barking—the dog Arthur had left behind. 
“Dad! Dad!” we shrieked. We burst through the door. “We found him! We 
found the Abominable Snowman!” 

“Dad?” 

The cabin stood empty. Empty and bare. 

Dad was gone. 



21 


My eyes darted around the empty cabin. 

“Dad? Dad?” 

My heart skipped a beat. My throat went dry. 

Where did he go? 

Was he out searching for Nicole and me? Did he get lost in the snow? 

“We—we’re all alone,” I murmured. 

Nicole and I ran to the window. A thin layer of snow frosted the pane. We 
peered out into the bright sunlight. 

No sign of Dad. 

“At least the snowman didn’t follow us,” I said. 

“Jordan, why did he drop us?” Nicole asked softly. 

“I think the barking dog scared him,” I replied. 

If that dog hadn’t barked, what would the monster have done to us? 

As the question pushed into my mind, I heard the dog start to bark again. 
Nicole and I both gasped. 

“The snowman—!” I cried. “He’s back! Hide!” 

We glanced around, frantically searching for a good hiding place. The cabin 
was so bare—it wouldn’t take the monster long to find us. 

“Behind the stove!” Nicole urged. 

We dashed to the small, square stove and crouched behind it. 

Outside the cabin we heard the slow, heavy footsteps of the monster. 

Crunch, crunch, crunch. Footsteps over the snow. 

Nicole grabbed my hand. We froze, waiting. Listening. 

Crunch, crunch. 

Please don’t come into the cabin, I prayed. Please don’t capture us again. 
The footsteps stopped outside the door. I squeezed my eyes shut. 

The door burst open. A blast of cold air blew into the room. 

“Jordan? Nicole?” 

Dad! 

We jumped out from behind the stove. There stood Dad, with his camera 
around his neck. 



We both ran to him and hugged him. “Dad! I’m so glad it’s you!” 

“Hi!” he replied. “What’s going on, guys? I expected you to be asleep.” He 
glanced around the cabin. “Hey—where’s Arthur?” 

“He took off!” I cried breathlessly. “He took the sled. He took all the food 
and three of the dogs.” 

“We chased after him,” Nicole added. “But he got away.” 

Dad’s face filled with surprise, then horror. “I’d better radio for help. We 
won’t last long without food.” 

“Dad—listen.” I blocked his way to the radio. “Nicole and I—found the 
Abominable Snowman!” 

He sidestepped around me. “This is no time for jokes, Jordan. If we don’t 
get help, we could starve to death out here!” 

“He’s not joking, Dad,” Nicole insisted, tugging Dad’s arm. “We really 
found the snowman. He lives in a cave under the snow.” 

Dad stopped and studied Nicole. He always believes her. But this time he 
wasn’t sure. 

“It’s true!” I cried. “Come on—we’ll show you!” 

Nicole and I tugged him out the door. 

“Jordan, if this is one of your tricks, you are going to be in major trouble,” 
he warned. “We’re in a serious situation here and—” 

“Dad, he’s not kidding!” Nicole cried impatiently. “Come on!” 

We led him out into the snow to the spot where the snowman had dropped 
us. We pointed out his huge footprints. 

“Why should I believe this?” Dad said. “You faked the snowman’s 
footprints this morning, Jordan. These just look a little bigger.” 

“Dad, I swear—I didn’t make these prints!” 

“We’ll show you the cave, Dad,” Nicole promised. “Follow the footprints. 
You’ll see. It’s unbelievable!” 

I knew Dad went along with us only because Nicole insisted. He trusted 
her. She never played jokes on him. 

Leaning into the wind, we traced the giant prints across the snow. Dad 
couldn’t resist snapping pictures of them—just in case. 

The footsteps led us back to the cave. They stopped at an opening in the 
ground. 

“The cave is down that hole,” I told Dad, pointing. 

I think Dad believed us now. “Let’s go. Check it out,” he said. 



“Huh?” I cried. “Back down there? To the monster?” 

Dad was already sliding down to the cave opening. He reached up to help 
Nicole climb down. 

I hesitated. “Dad—wait. You don’t understand. There’s a monster down 
there!” 

“Come on, Jordan,” Dad urged. “I want to see this for myself.” 

I had no choice. Dad was going in there no matter what I said. And I didn’t 
want to wait outside alone. I scrambled down to the opening of the cave. 

The three of us felt our way along the narrow passage until we reached the 
mouth of the big cave. 

Keeping close together, Dad and Nicole walked in. But I stopped at the 
entrance and stared into the cave. 

“Jordan! Come on!” Dad whispered. 

There’s a monster in there, I thought with a shudder. A huge monster with 
long claws and sharp teeth. 

We managed to escape from him once. Why are we going back? What’s 
going to happen to us in there? 

I had a bad feeling. A very bad feeling. 



22 


Dad grabbed me by the hand and pulled me into the cave. I heard the drip of icy 
water against the back wall. I blinked in the darkness. 

Where was he? Where was the Abominable Snowman? 

I heard Dad’s camera clicking away. I tried to stay close to Dad. I cried out 
when I spotted the snowman. I expected him to roar and lumber after us. 

But he stood stiffly, staring straight ahead. 

Refrozen again. Inside a huge block of ice. 

Nicole stepped closer to the block of ice. “How does he do that?” 

“This is amazing !” Dad cried, snapping picture after picture. “ Incredible /” 

I stared up at the monster’s face. He glared out at us from inside the ice. His 
black eyes glittered, his mouth set in a toothy snarl. 

“This is the most amazing discovery in history!” 

Dad exclaimed. “Do you realize how famous we are going to be?” 

He stopped shooting for a second and peered up at the brown-furred 
monster. 

“Why stop here?” he murmured. “Why go home with nothing but photos? 
Why not take the snowman himself back to California? Do you know what a 
sensation that will create?” 

“But—how?” Nicole asked. 

“He’s alive, you know, Dad,” I warned. “I mean, he can crack out of that 
ice. And when he does, it’s really scary. I don’t think you could control him.” 

Dad knocked gently on the ice, testing it. “We won’t let him out of the ice,” 
he said. “At least not until we’ve got him under control.” 

Dad walked all the way around the block of ice, rubbing his chin. “If we cut 
the ice a bit, it might fit into the supply trunk,” he said. “Then we could carry the 
snowman back to California in the block of ice, locked in the trunk. It’s airtight, 
so the ice won’t melt.” 

He stepped up close to the ice and snapped a few more shots of the 
snowman’s snarling face. “Let’s go get the trunk, kids.” 

“Dad—wait.” I didn’t like this idea. “You don’t understand. The snowman 
could rush us! He let us go once. But why take another chance?” 

“Look at his teeth, Dad,” Nicole pleaded. “He’s so strong, he picked us both 



up at once!” 

“It’s worth the risk,” Dad insisted. “Neither of you is hurt, right?” 

Nicole and I nodded. “Yes, but—” 

“Let’s go.” Dad had made his mind up. He wasn’t going to listen to our 
warnings. 

I’d never seen him so excited. As we hurried from the cave, he called to the 
snowman, “Don’t go away—we’ll be right back!” 

We rushed over the snow to the cabin. Dad pulled the supply trunk outside. 
It was about six feet long and three feet wide. 

“The snowman will fit,” he said. “But with him inside the trunk, it will be 
very heavy.” 

“We need the dogsled to pull it,” Nicole said. 

“But Arthur took the sled,” I reminded them. “So I guess the deal is off. 
We’ll just have to go home without an Abominable Snowman. Too bad!” 

“Maybe there’s another sled around somewhere,” Dad suggested. “This is 
an old musher’s cabin, after all.” 

I remembered the old sled I’d seen in the dog shed. Nicole had seen it, too. 
She led Dad to it. 

“Fantastic!” Dad cried. “Now let’s go get that snowman before he escapes.” 

We hitched Lars, our only dog, to the old sled and towed the supply trunk to 
the cave. 

Then we crept silently into the cave, pulling the trunk behind us. “Careful, 
Dad,” I warned. “He might have broken out of the ice by now.” 

But the Abominable Snowman stood where we’d left him, frozen in his 
block of ice. 

Dad began to cut the ice down to size with a hacksaw. 

I paced nervously. “Hurry!” I whispered. “He could burst out any minute!” 

“This isn’t easy,” Dad snapped. “I’m working as fast as I can.” He hacked 
away. 

Each second felt like an hour to me. I watched the snowman carefully for 
any signs of movement. 

“Dad, do you have to saw so loudly?” I complained. “The noise could wake 
him up!” 

“Relax, Jordan,” Dad said. But his voice was tight and shrill, too. 

Then I heard a crack. 

“Look out!” I cried. “He’s breaking out!” 



Dad straightened up. “I cracked the ice a bit, Jordan.” 

I studied the monster. He hadn’t moved. 

“Okay, kids,” Dad said. “We’re ready.” Dad had cut the ice into a six-foot- 
long rectangle. “Help me slide this into the trunk.” 

I opened the lid of the trunk. Nicole and I helped Dad tip the ice over and 
gently drop it into the trunk. It just barely fit. 

We slid the trunk along the ground to the opening of the cave. Dad tied a 
rope around it and climbed out of the hole. “I’ll tie the rope to the sled,” Dad 
called from above. “That way Lars can help me hoist it out.” 

“Hey,” I whispered to Nicole, “let’s sneak some snowballs into the trunk— 
just for fun. We can throw them at Kyle and Kara when we get home. Snow 
from the cave of the Abominable Snowman—they’ll never top that!” 

“No—please. Don’t open the trunk,” Nicole begged. “We just barely got the 
snowman inside.” 

“We can squeeze a few snowballs in,” I insisted. I quickly made a bunch of 
snowballs, packing them tight. Then I cracked open the trunk and slipped them 
inside, next to the block of ice. 

I checked the monster one last time for signs of life. The ice was solid. We 
were safe. 

“They won’t melt in there,” I said sealing the lid of the trunk shut. We 
locked it with the bolt and tightened the rope around it. I felt pretty sure the 
snowman wouldn’t be able to break out of there; even if he did crack through the 
ice. 

“Ready?” Dad shouted from up above. “One, two, three—heave!” 

Dad and Lars tugged on the rope until the chest lifted off the ground. Nicole 
and I squatted beneath it to help push it up. 

“Again!” Dad yelled. “Heave!” 

We pushed as hard as we could. “It’s so heavy!” Nicole complained. 

“Come on, kids!” Dad called. “Push!” 

We gave the trunk a shove. Dad and Lars tugged it over the lip of the cave 
opening. 

Dad collapsed in the snow. “Whew,” he muttered, wiping his brow. “Well, 
the hardest part is over.” 

He helped Nicole and me scramble out. 

We all rested a few minutes. Then we dragged the trunk onto the sled. Dad 
secured it with the rope. Lars pulled the sled back to the cabin. 



Once inside, Dad hugged us both. “What a day! What a great day!” 

He turned to me. “See, Jordan? Nothing terrible happened.” 

“We’re lucky,” I said. 

“I’m so sleepy,” Nicole complained, sinking onto her sleeping bag. 

I glanced out the window. The sun sat high in the sky, as usual. But I knew 
it had to be very late. 

Dad glanced at his watch. “It’s almost midnight. You two should get some 
sleep.” He frowned. “I’d hate to wake up here in the morning with no food, 
though. I’m going to radio for help. You guys can sleep when we get back to 
town.” 

“Can we stay in a hotel?” I asked Dad. “In a bed?” 

“If we can find one,” he promised. He opened his pack, searching for the 
radio. 

He shuffled stuff around in his pack. Then he pulled things out, one by one. 
A compass. An extra camera. Cans of film. A pair of socks, balled up. 

I didn’t like the look on his face. He turned the pack over and dumped 
everything on the floor. He sifted through it, again, getting frantic. 

“Dad? What’s the matter?” 

When he turned to me, he had a terrified expression on his face. “The 
radio,” he murmured. “It’s gone.” 



23 


“No!” Nicole and I both shrieked. 

“I don’t believe it!” Dad cried, pounding his fist against his empty pack. 
“Arthur must have taken the radio so we wouldn’t report him.” 

I stomped around the room, frightened and furious. Our dogs, our sled, our 
food—Arthur had taken them all. 

And now the radio. 

Did Arthur leave us here to freeze? To starve? 

“Calm down, Jordan,” Dad said. 

“But, Dad—” Nicole interrupted. 

Dad shushed her. “Just a second, Nicole. I’ve got to think of a way out of 
this.” Dad searched the cabin. “Don’t panic. Don’t panic. Don’t panic,” he 
instructed himself. 

“But Dad—” Nicole said, tugging at his sleeve. 

“Nicole!” I snapped. “We’re in huge trouble. We could die out here!” 

“Dad!” she insisted. “Listen to me! You wrapped up the radio last night so 
it wouldn’t freeze. It’s in your sleeping bag!” 

Dad’s mouth dropped open. “You’re right!” he cried. He hurried to his 
sleeping bag and reached inside. He dug into his sleeping bag—and pulled out 
the radio, wrapped in a wool scarf. 

He switched on the radio and fiddled with the dials. “Iknek, Iknek. Come 
in, Iknek.” 

Dad asked the Iknek airport to send us a helicopter. He tried to describe 
where we were. 

Nicole and I smiled sleepily at each other. 

“We’re going home!” she said happily. “Home to sunny, hot Pasadena.” 

“I’m going to kiss a palm tree!” I declared. “I never want to see snow 
again.” 

I had no idea that our snowy adventure was just beginning! 



24 


“Ahhhh,” I sighed. “Feel that sun? Nice and hot.” 

“The radio said it’s a hundred degrees today,” Nicole reported. 

“I love it!” I beamed. “Love it!” 

I slapped more tanning lotion on my chest. 

Our Alaska trip all seemed unreal, now that we were home in Pasadena. 
The cold, the snow, the wind blowing over the rolling white tundra. The snarling, 
brown-furred Abominable Snowman. It all seemed like a dream. 

But I knew it was no dream. 

Dad had hidden the trunk with the Abominable Snowman inside the 
darkroom in the backyard. Every time I passed it, I remembered the trip... 
remembered the creature lying frozen in there—and shivered. 

In our swimsuits, Nicole and I caught some rays in the backyard. Good old 
sunny Pasadena. Where it never, never snowed. 

Thank goodness. 

Lauren came over to hear about our trip. I wanted to tell her the whole story. 
But Dad told us to keep quiet about it—at least until the snowman was safely 
settled somewhere. 

“I don’t believe you two!” Lauren snorted. “A week ago you wouldn’t shut 
up about snow. Now you’re letting the sun burn you to a crisp!” 

“Well, we did the cold thing and now we’re doing the hot thing,” I told her. 
“Anyway, I’ve seen enough snow to last me the rest of my life.” 

“Tell me about the trip,” Lauren insisted. “Tell me everything!” 

“It’s a big secret,” Nicole told her. She and I exchanged glances. 

“Secret? What kind of secret?” Lauren demanded. 

Before we could reply, Dad emerged from the darkroom. He squinted in the 
sunlight. He wore a down jacket, a ski cap, and gloves. He had turned the air- 
conditioning way up in the darkroom and covered the trunk with ice packs, to 
keep the snowman cold. 

“I’m going into the city now,” he announced, removing his coat. Dad had a 
meeting with some scientists and wildlife experts in Los Angeles. 

He wanted to turn the Abominable Snowman over to the right people. He 
wanted to be sure the snowman would be treated well. 



“Are you kids going to be all right while I’m gone?” he asked. 

“Of course,” Nicole replied. “We survived the Alaskan tundra. I think we 
can live through one afternoon in our own backyard.” 

“My mom is home,” Lauren said. “She’ll be around if we need anything.” 
“Good.” Dad nodded. “Okay, I’m off. But remember—Jordan and Nicole, 
are you listening? Don’t touch the supply trunk. Stay away from it— 
understood?” 

“Gotcha, Dad,” I promised. 

“All right. I’ll bring a pizza home for dinner.” 

“Good luck, Dad!” Nicole called. I watched him jump into the car and drive 
off. 

“So what’s the big secret?” Lauren asked as soon as Dad was gone. “What’s 
in the supply trunk?” 

Nicole and I glanced at each other. 

“Come on. Spill,” Lauren urged. “I won’t leave you alone until you tell 

me.” 

I couldn’t resist. I had to tell someone. “We found him. We found him and 
we brought him back.” 

“Found who?” 

“The snowman!” Nicole exclaimed. “The Abominable Snowman!” 

Lauren rolled her eyes. “For sure. And did you find the Tooth Fairy up 
there, too?” 

“Yes, we did,” I joked. 

“He’s lying in the darkroom right now,” Nicole told Lauren. 

Lauren’s face twisted in confusion. “Who—the Tooth Fairy?” 

“No. The Abominable Snowman. Areal one,” I said. “Trapped in a block of 

ice.” 

Along with four or five snowballs, I thought to myself. 

Snowballs I could throw at Lauren. For a nice little surprise. 

“Prove it,” Lauren challenged us. “You’re making it all up. You think 
you’re really funny.” 

Nicole and I exchanged glances. I knew what she was thinking. Dad had 
just told us to stay away from the trunk. 

“You two are as bad as the Miller twins,” Lauren complained. 

That did it. “Come on,” I said. “We’ll show you.” 

“We’d better not, Jordan,” Nicole argued. 



“We won’t hurt anything,” I promised. “We’ll just pull open the lid a tiny 
bit so Lauren can see him. Then we’ll slam it shut. No harm done.” 

I climbed off my lounge chair and started across the lawn to the darkroom. 
Nicole and Lauren followed me. 

I knew they would. 

I opened the darkroom door and switched on the light. A blast of cold air 
swept over me, making my bare chest tingle. 

Nicole hesitated in the doorway. “Jordan, maybe we shouldn’t.” 

“Oh, come on, Nicole,” Lauren chided. “There’s no Abominable Snowman. 
You two are ridiculous!” 

“We’re not ridiculous!” Nicole protested. 

“We might as well show her, Nicole,” I said. 

Nicole didn’t reply. She stepped into the darkroom and shut the door. 

In my bathing suit, I was shivering from the cold. It was almost like being 
back in Alaska. 

I knelt beside the huge trunk. I unhooked the latches. 

Slowly, carefully, I lifted the heavy lid. 

Peered inside. 

And let out a chilling, bloodcurdling scream of horror. 



25 


Nicole and Lauren shrieked and leaped back. 

Nicole backed into the wall with a crash. 

Lauren ducked under the developing table. 

I couldn’t keep a straight face. I started to laugh. “Gotcha!” I cried 
gleefully. I was so pleased with myself. 

I had scared them to death. They were both stiffer than the Abominable 
Snowman. He lay frozen and still inside his block of ice. 

“Jordan—you creep!” Nicole declared angrily. She punched me in the back. 

Lauren punched me too. Then she peered into the open trunk. 

And let out another scream. “He’s real! You—you weren’t kidding!” I could 
see that she was breathing hard. 

“It’s okay, Lauren,” I assured her. “He can’t hurt you. He’s frozen.” 

She stepped closer and stared down at him. 

“He’s huge!” she cried in amazement. “His—his eyes are open. They’re so 
mean-looking!” 

“Close the lid, Jordan,” Nicole insisted. “Quick. We’ve seen enough.” 

“Now do you believe us?” I asked Lauren. 

She nodded. “It’s... awesome!” She shook her head, stunned at the amazing 
sight. 

Before I shut the lid, I sneaked two snowballs out of the bottom of the 
trunk. Snickering, I passed one to Nicole. 

“What’s so funny?” Lauren asked suspiciously. 

“Nothing,” I said. I sealed the lid shut and latched the trunk. That’ll hold 
him, I thought. We’re safe. Dad will never know we sneaked a peek at the 
monster. 

We left the darkroom, closing the door carefully behind us. 

“That creature is just so awesome!” Lauren exclaimed. “What is your dad 
going to do with him?” 

“We’re not sure yet,” Nicole replied. “Dad’s trying to figure that out.” 

She held her hands behind her back, hiding the snowball from Lauren. 
Suddenly she shouted, “Hey, Lauren! Think fast!” 



She threw the snowball at Lauren. It missed. 

Splat! It hit a tree. 

“Nice shot, ace!” I cried sarcastically. 

But then I gaped at the tree in shock. 

The snowball—it didn’t crumble to the ground. 

It started to growl 

Thick white snow spread quickly up the tree trunk—and over the branches. 
Within seconds, the entire tree was covered with snow! 

“Wow!” Lauren gasped. “Nicole—how did you do that?” 

Nicole and I stared open-mouthed at the snow-covered tree. 

I was so stunned, the snowball fell out of my hand. 

I jumped back as it hit the ground—and spread! 

“Oh, wow!” I shrieked. I watched snow spread over the lawn like a white 
blanket. 

It spread under our bare feet. Over the driveway. Out to the street. 

“Ooooh! It’s cold!” Nicole wailed, hopping from foot to foot. 

“This is too weird!” I cried. “It’s a hundred degrees out—and the snow isn’t 
melting! It’s spreading—and growing deeper!” 

I turned to see Lauren hopping and dancing, whirling around wildly. 
“Snow! Snow!” she sang. “It’s wonderful! Snow in Pasadena!” 

“Jordan—” Nicole said quietly. “This isn’t right. We should have left this 
snow in the cave. It isn’t normal snow.” 

Of course she was right. Any cave where an Abominable Snowman lives 
has got to be a weird place. But how could we have guessed—? 

“Let’s build a snowman!” Lauren cried gleefully. 

“No!” Nicole warned. “Don’t touch it. Don’t do anything, Lauren. Not until 
we’ve figured this out.” 

I don’t think Lauren heard my sister. She was too excited. She kicked a 
spray of snow at an evergreen bush. The bush froze over with snow. 

“What are we going to do?” I asked Nicole. “What’s going to happen when 
Dad comes home? He’ll kill us!” 

Nicole shrugged. “Beats me.” 

“But—but—you’re supposed to be the brain ]” I sputtered. 

“This is so cool!” Lauren squealed. “Snow in Pasadena!” She picked up a 
chunk of snow and started balling it up between her hands. 

“Snowball fight!” she shouted. 



“Stop it, Lauren!” I cried. “We’re in big trouble here. Don’t you understand 

_ ?” 

Lauren fired the snowball at Nicole. 

Instantly, thick white snow spread all over Nicole’s body. Covering her. 
Covering her until she looked like a snowman! 

“Nicole!” I cried, running over the snowy ground to her. “Nicole—are you 
okay?” 

I grabbed her arm. Stiff as an icicle. She was frozen solid! 

“Nicole?” I stared into her snow-covered eyes. “Can you hear me, Nicole? 
Can you breathe in there? Nicole? Nicole?” 



26 


“Oh, no!” Lauren shrieked. “What have I done?” 

My sister was a statue. A frozen, snow-covered statue. 

“Nicole, I’m so sorry,” Lauren cried. “Can you hear me? I’m so sorry!” 

“Let’s take her inside,” I suggested frantically. “If we get her in the warm 
house, maybe we can warm her up.” 

Lauren grabbed one of Nicole’s arms. I grabbed the other. We carefully 
dragged her stiff body to the house. Her bare toes, hard as ice, left a long trail in 
the snow. 

“She’s so freezing!” Lauren cried. “How can we melt the snow?” 

“Let’s put her next to the oven,” I said. “Maybe if we turn it up full blast, 
the snow will melt.” 

We stood her in front of the oven. For good measure, I turned on all the 
burners on top of the stove. 

“That ought to do it,” I said. A bead of sweat trickled down my face. From 
the heat—or from worry? 

Lauren and I watched and waited. 

Watched and waited. 

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. 

The snow didn’t melt. 

“It’s not working,” Lauren groaned. “Nothing’s happening.” 

I tapped Nicole’s arm. Solid ice. 

I tried to stay calm. But I felt as if a hundred butterflies were tap dancing in 
my stomach. “All right, it’s not working. We’ll have to try something else. 
Something else...” 

Tears rolled down Lauren’s cheeks. “Like what?” Lauren demanded in a 
trembling voice. 

“Well...” I racked my brain for the hottest place I could think of. “The 
furnace! We’ll hold her in front of the furnace.” 

We dragged Nicole into the furnace shed behind the garage. The snow 
seemed to weigh a ton. It took all our strength to drag her. 

I turned the furnace on full blast. Lauren stood Nicole in front of the open 
furnace door. 



A blast of hot air sent Lauren and me staggering back. “If this doesn’t work, 
nothing will,” Lauren sobbed. 

The heat roared out of the furnace. I saw reflections of the red flames on 
Nicole’s icy face. 

My heart pounding, I watched to see the ice start to drip and the snow slide 
off her. 

But the ice didn’t melt. My sister remained a human snow cone. 

“Jordan—what are we going to do?” Lauren wailed. 

I shook my head, thinking hard. “The furnace isn’t working. What else is 
hot?” I was too scared to think clearly. 

“Don’t worry, Nicole,” Lauren told my frozen sister. “We’ll get you out of 
this—somehow.” 

I suddenly remembered how warm the Abominable Snowman had felt 
when he carried us across the Alaskan tundra. There we were, ten degrees below 
zero, surrounded by deep snow, and heat had poured off the creature’s body. 

“Come on, Lauren,” I ordered. “We’re taking her to the darkroom.” 

Struggling and straining, we dragged Nicole back outside and across the 
backyard to the darkroom. 

“Stay here,” I told Lauren. “I’ll be right back.” 

I raced into the kitchen. I pulled open all the cupboards and drawers, 
desperately searching for one thing—trail mix. 

Please, please let there be trail mix somewhere in this house! I prayed. 

“Yes!” I found a plastic bag of trail mix behind an old box of spaghetti. I 
grabbed it and flew back to the darkroom. 

Lauren stared at the bag in my hand. “What’s that?” 

“Trail mix.” 

“Trail mix? Jordan, can’t you wait to eat later?” 

“It’s not for me—it’s for him” I motioned at the trunk. 

“What?” 

I unlatched the trunk and pulled it open. The Abominable Snowman lay 
inside as before, frozen in the block of ice. 

I grabbed a handful of trail mix and waved it above the snowman’s face. 
“Wake up!” I begged. “Please wake up! Look—I brought you some trail mix!” 

“Jordan—have you totally lost it?” Lauren screeched. “What on earth are 
you doing?” 

“I can’t think of any other way to save Nicole!” I cried. 



My hand trembled as I frantically waved the trail mix over the snowman. 
“Come on! You know you love trail mix. Wake up! Please wake up! Come out 
and help us.” 

I leaned over, staring hard at the monster’s eyes. Watching for him to blink. 
Watching for any signs of life. 

But the eyes didn’t move. The creature stared lifelessly up through the 
block of ice. 

I refused to give up. 

“Yum, yum!” I shouted, my voice high and wild. 

“Trail mix! Boy, is that good!” I popped a few raisins into my mouth and 
chewed. “Mmm-mm! Delicious trail mix. So good! So tasty! Come on—wake 
up and try some!” 

“He’s not moving!” Lauren sobbed. “Give up, Jordan. It isn’t going to 
work.” 



27 


I jumped when I heard a soft sound. A faint crick. 

I stared down at the block of ice. 

Did the monster move? 

No. Silence now. The Abominable Snowman’s black eyes glittered up at 
me, lifeless and blank. 

Was it my imagination? 

Lauren is right, I thought sadly. My plan isn’t working. 

Nothing is working. 

I gently touched my sister’s stiff, frozen arm. Maybe when Dad gets home, 
I hoped. Maybe he’ll think of some way to save her. 

“What are we going to dooooo?” Lauren sobbed. She was no help at all. 
Crack. 

I heard it again—louder this time. 

And then: Crrraaaaaccckkkk! 

A long crack ripped across the ice. 

The Abominable Snowman groaned. 

Lauren leaped back with a wild scream. “It’s alive!” 

The ice broke up. The furry snowman slowly pulled himself up, moaning. 
Lauren cried out in fear. She pressed herself against the darkroom wall. 
“What’s he going to do?” 

“Shhh!” 

The monster shook shards of broken ice from his shoulders. He lifted 
himself out of the trunk. He uttered a low growl. 

“Jordan, look out!” Lauren cried. 

The monster lurched toward me. My heart jumped. I wanted to back away 
—or run away. But I couldn’t. I had to stay and help Nicole. 

“Unh!” the snowman grunted. He swiped a giant paw at me. 

Lauren let out another shrill scream. 

I leaped back. What would the monster do? 

“Unh!” the monster cried again. He took another swipe. 

“Let’s get out of here!” Lauren shouted. “He’s going to hurt you!” 



I wanted to run. But Nicole... 

The monster swiped at me again—and snatched the bag of trail mix out of 
my hands. 

I suddenly realized that was all he wanted. He had been grabbing for the 
trail mix. 

He poured the trail mix into his mouth, gulping it down, swallowing it 
noisily. Then he tossed the bag away. 

Lauren pressed her back against the corner of the darkroom. “Make him go 
back into the trunk!” she cried. 

“Are you crazy? How can I do that?” 

The snowman growled and staggered across the floor. 

His heavy footsteps shook the floor. He stopped in front of Nicole. 

He reached his powerful arms around her snow-covered body—and 
squeezed. 

“Stop him!” Lauren screamed. “He’s crushing her!” 



28 


I couldn’t move. I stared in horror. 

The big creature hugged Nicole hard—so hard that he lifted her off the 
ground. 

“Stop!” I finally choked out. “You’re hurting her!” 

Without thinking of the danger, I dove forward. I grabbed his furry arms 
with both hands—and struggled to pull him off my sister. 

With an angry grunt, he brushed me away. 

I stumbled back—and fell into Lauren. 

I turned to see the monster squeezing Nicole. 

Lauren pointed down at the floor. “Jordan—look!” 

Gazing down, I saw a small puddle under Nicole’s feet. Water dripped off 
her and onto the floor. As it hit the floor, it evaporated. Vanished from sight. 

Did I see Nicole’s toes wiggle? 

Yes! 

I stepped closer. Caught a glimpse of her face. 

A dot of pink appeared on her cheeks. 

Yes! 

Chunks of snow dropped off her body. They thudded to the floor, melted, 
and disappeared. 

I turned to Lauren. “It’s working!” I cried happily. “He’s defrosting her!” 

A trembling smile crossed Lauren’s worried face. 

A few seconds later, the snowman let Nicole go. The ice and snow had all 
melted and disappeared. The snowman gave a satisfied grunt and stepped back. 

Nicole moved her arms stiffly. She rubbed her face, as if she were waking 
up. 

“Nicole!” I cried, grabbing her by the shoulders. Warm. Her shoulders were 
warm. “Are you okay?” 

She shook her head, dazed. “What happened?” 

Lauren ran up to Nicole and threw her arms around her. “You were frozen!” 
she said. “Frozen like a snowman! But thank goodness—you’re all right!” 

I turned to see the snowman watching us. 



“Thank you,” I called to him. 

I don’t know if he understood me. He grunted. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Lauren urged. “I’m freezing!” 

“Maybe the sun will warm you up,” I told her. 

We opened the darkroom door and stepped outside. The sun still beamed 
down. The air felt sweltering hot. But the whole yard was covered in snow. 

“Oh, yeah,” Lauren murmured. “I forgot about that.” 

“Hey—!” I cried out when I saw the Abominable Snowman leap out of the 
darkroom. “He’s escaping!” I shrieked. 

“Dad will kill us!” Nicole cried. 

All three of us started shouting at the creature. 

He ignored our cries and thudded heavily across the snow. His black eyes 
narrowed on the snow-covered tree. He stepped up to the tree. Threw his arms 
around it. And hugged it tightly, just like when he had hugged Nicole. 

I watched as the snow began to melt. The blanket of white slipped down, 
down, shrinking away—until the tree stood green and golden again under the 
sunlight. 

“Wow!” I uttered, hands pressed against my face. 

But the big, furry creature had more surprises in store. 

With a loud grunt, he dropped to the snowy ground. As we stared in 
surprise, he began to roll in the snow. 

The snow appeared to stick to his fur. As he rolled, the snow vanished 
beneath him. 

Before long, the big creature was rolling on green grass. The last of the 
snow had vanished. 

He jumped to his feet. His eyes went wide, and he uttered a pained cry. 

“What’s the matter with him?” Lauren demanded. 

The Abominable Snowman gazed around, stunned, at the green grass, the 
palm trees. Then he raised his eyes to the blazing sun. 

He clutched his fur-covered head and let out a scream of terror. 

He seemed confused for a moment. Frightened. Then he let out a deep grunt 
—and took off down the street. His big paws thudded heavily over the pavement. 

I ran after him. “Wait! Come back!” 

He tore through someone’s yard and kept running. 

I gave up. No way I could catch him. 

Nicole and Lauren caught up to me. “Where’s he going?” Nicole 



demanded. 

“How should I know?” I snapped, struggling to catch my breath. 

“I think he’s looking for someplace cold,” Lauren said. 

Nicole agreed. “You’re probably right. He must be so hot. Pasadena is no 
place for an Abominable Snowman.” 

“He’ll probably find a cave in the mountains,” I said. “It’s a lot colder up 
there. I only hope he finds a way to get trail mix.” 

We trudged back to our yard. Green again. And hot. I knew that Nicole and 
I had one word in our minds—D-A-D. 

He had instructed us not to touch the trunk. We had ignored his warning. 

Now the snowman was gone. Dad’s big discovery. Dad’s big chance for 
fame. 

Gone. Gone forever. 

It was all our fault. 

“At least Dad has his photos,” I said softly. “The photos will amaze 
everyone all by themselves.” 

“I guess so,” Nicole replied, biting her bottom lip tensely. 

We walked back to the darkroom to close up the supply trunk. I glanced 
inside the trunk. Two magic snowballs were left. 

“Those things are dangerous. We’d better get rid of them,” Nicole warned. 

“I’m not touching them.” Lauren backed away. 

“You’re right,” I told my sister. “We should hide them somewhere. They’re 
too dangerous to keep around.” 

Nicole ran into the house and returned with a heavy-duty garbage bag. 
“Quick—stuff them in here.” 

I carefully scooped up each snowball and dropped it in the trash bag. Then I 
twisted the bag closed and knotted it tightly. 

“Now what?” Lauren asked. 

“We should blast them into outer space,” Nicole said. “If anyone gets hold 
of them and starts spreading snow around, we’ll be in big trouble. We need the 
Abominable Snowman to get rid of the snow—and he’s gone.” 

“Pasadena could turn into a ski resort!” I joked. “We could ice skate on 
Kyle and Kara’s swimming pool.” 

I shivered. I didn’t want to think about Kyle and Kara. And I didn’t want to 
think about snow. “We should bury the snowballs,” I told them. “But where?” 

“Not in my yard!” Lauren protested. 



I didn’t want to bury them in our yard, either. What would happen to them 
down there? Would they spread snow underground? Would snow spring up 
through the grass? 

We left the darkroom and scanned the area for good burial spots. 

“What about the empty lot?” Nicole suggested. 

Across the street, right next to Kyle and Kara Miller’s house, stood a vacant 
lot. There was nothing in it but piles of sand and a few empty bottles. 

“Perfect,” I declared. “No one will ever find the snowballs there.” 

Nicole hurried to the garage and grabbed a shovel. We crossed the street, 
glancing around to make sure no one saw us. 

“The coast is clear,” I said. 

I grabbed the shovel and dug a deep hole in the sand. It took longer than I 
thought. Sand kept falling back into the hole. 

Finally, the hole was deep enough. 

Nicole dropped the trash bag into the hole. “Good-bye, snowballs,” she 
said. “Good-bye, Alaska.” 

I covered the hole with sand. Lauren smoothed it out so you couldn’t tell 
the sand had been dug up. 

“Whew,” I groaned, wiping the sweat from my face. “I’m glad that’s over. 
Let’s go inside and cool off.” 

I put away the shovel. Then Nicole, Lauren, and I got ourselves some cold 
apple juice and collapsed in front of the TV. 

A short while later, we heard Dad’s car pull into the driveway. 

“Uh-oh,” Lauren gasped. “I think I’d better go home now. See you guys 
later.” She hurried out the back door. “Good luck!” she called. The door 
slammed behind her. 

I gave Nicole a nervous glance. “How angry will Dad be? He finds an 
amazing, rare creature, brings it home—we let it loose, and it runs away. That’s 
not so bad —is it?” 

Nicole shuddered. “Maybe if we tell him the whole story, he’ll be so glad 
we’re not hurt that he won’t be angry.” 

“Uh-huh. Yeah. Maybe.” 

The front door swung open. “Hey, kids!” Dad called. “I’m home! How’s 
our snowman doing?” 



29 


We ate supper early that evening. Things were pretty quiet around the dinner 
table. 

Tm glad you kids are safe and sound,” Dad said for the fifth time. “That’s 
what counts.” 

“Yeah,” Nicole said, chewing her pizza. 

“Uh-huh,” I added quietly. I usually had three slices. Tonight I could barely 
manage one. And I left the crust on the plate. 

Poor Dad. He was trying so hard not to get upset about losing the 
Abominable Snowman. But Nicole and I knew how bad he felt. 

Dad dropped his half-eaten slice of pizza on his plate. “I’ll tell the Museum 
of Natural History that they’ll have to make do with the photographs.” 

“Photographs are better than nothing,” I said. 

“Better than nothing? Are you crazy?” Nicole cried. “Those pictures are 
going to amaze the whole world!” 

Dad perked up. “That’s true. I mentioned them to some TV producers. They 
went wild.” 

He stood and carried his plate to the sink. “I think I’ll go out to the 
darkroom and develop that film right now. These pictures are going to cheer me 
up. I mean, they’re historic. Historic!” 

I was glad to see Dad snap out of his disappointment. Nicole and I followed 
him, eager to see the photos. 

We sat quietly under the red light while Dad developed the negatives. At 
last he pulled the first set of contact sheets out of the chemical baths. 

Nicole and I leaned close to see the pictures. 

“Huh?” Dad uttered an astonished cry. 

Snow. Nothing but snow. Ten pictures of snow. 

“That’s strange,” Dad choked out. “I don’t remember taking those shots.” 

Nicole flashed me an evil stare. I knew what she was thinking. 

I held my hands up innocently. “I’m not playing any tricks. I swear!” 

“You’d better not be, Jordan,” Dad warned sternly. “I’m in no mood for 
kidding around.” 

Dad turned back to the chemical trays and developed another set of photos. 



As he pulled them up, dripping wet, we all squinted at them. 

More snow. Nothing but snow. 

“This can’t be happening!” Dad screamed. “The Abominable Snowman— 
he should be standing right there!” He pointed. 

His hands shook as he grabbed the rest of the negatives and held them up to 
the red light. “The tundra shots came out fine,” he declared. “The dogs, the sled, 
the elk herd—all there. All perfect. All of them. But the shots in the monster’s 
cave—” 

His voice trailed off. He shook his head sadly. “I don’t get it. I just don’t get 
it. How could this be? Not a single shot of the creature. Not one.” 

I sighed. I felt so bad for Dad. I felt so bad for all three of us. 

No Abominable Snowman. No photos of the Abominable Snowman. 

It was almost as if he never existed. As if the whole thing never happened. 

Nicole and I left Dad in the darkroom to finish his work. 

We trudged around the house to the front. Nicole groaned and grabbed my 
arm. “Oh, no! Look!” 

Across the street in the vacant lot, I saw the Miller twins kneeling down, 
digging in the sand. 

“They’re digging up the snowballs!” I gasped. 

“Those creeps!” Nicole growled. “They must have been spying on us while 
we buried them.” 

“We’ve got to stop them!” I cried. 

We hurried across the street, running full speed. 

I saw Kyle rip open the garbage bag—and pull out one of the snowballs. 

He swung back his arm and aimed at Kara. 

“No—Kyle! Stop!” I screamed. “Don’t throw it! Stop! Don’t throw it, 
Kyle!” 

THWOCK.

HOW I GOT MY 
SHRUNKEN HEAD 


Goosebumps - 39 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


Have you ever played Jungle King? It’s a computer game, and it’s really cool. 
Unless you sink into a quicksand pit or get squeezed to death by the Living 
Vines. 

You’ve got to be fast to swing from vine to vine without letting them curl 
around your body. And to grab the shmnken heads that are hidden under trees 
and bushes. 

If you collect ten shrunken heads, you get an extra life. You need a lot of 
extra lives in this game. It’s not for beginners. 

My friends Eric and Joel play Jungle King with me. They are twelve, like 
me. My sister Jessica is eight. She hangs around, but we don’t let her play. That’s 
because she always dives into the quicksand pits. She likes the thwuck thwuck 
thwuck sound it makes when your body is being sucked under. 

Jessica just doesn’t get it. 

“Mark, why can’t we play a different game?” Joel asked me. 

I knew why he wanted to quit. He had just been trampled by a red rhino, the 
meanest kind. 

Joel, Eric, and I were up in my room during our winter break from school, 
huddled around my computer. Jessica was on the window seat, reading a book. 
Sunlight poured over her, making her red hair sparkle. 

“Kah-lee-ah!” I shouted as I picked up my eighth shrunken head. Kah-lee- 
ah is my jungle cry. It’s a word that popped into my head one day. I guess I made 
it up. 

My face was two inches from the monitor screen. I ducked as spears came 
flying at me from behind a leafy fern. 

“Kah-lee-ah!” I let out my battle cry as I picked up another shrunken head. 

“Come on, Mark,” Eric pleaded. “Don’t you have any other games?” 

“Yeah. Don’t you have any sports games?” Joel demanded. “How about 
March Madness Basketball? That’s a cool game!” 

“How about Mutant Football?” Eric asked. 

“I like this game,” I replied, keeping my eyes on the screen. 

Why do I like Jungle King so much? I think it’s because I love swinging 
from vine to vine across the sky. 



You see, I’m a little chubby. Actually, I’m short and chubby. I’m built sort 
of like the red rhinos. And so I guess I like being able to swing so lightly, to fly 
above the ground like a bird. 

Also, it’s an awesome game. 

Joel and Eric don’t like it because I always win. In our first game this 
afternoon, an alligator chewed Joel in half. I think that put him in a bad mood. 

“Do you know what game my dad bought me?” Joel asked. “Battle 
Solitaire. ” 

I leaned closer to the screen. I had to get past the biggest quicksand pit. One 
slip, and I’d be sucked into the sandy slime. 

“What kind of game is that?” Eric asked Joel. 

“It’s a card game,” Joel told him. “You know. Solitaire. Only the cards fight 
each other.” 

“Cool,” Eric replied. 

“Hey, guys—I’m in a tough spot here,” I said. “Give me a break, okay? I’ve 
got to concentrate. I’m right over the quicksand pit.” 

“But we don’t want to play anymore,” Eric complained. 

I grabbed a vine. Swung hard. Then reached for the next one. 

And someone bumped my shoulder. “Owww!” 

I saw a flash of red hair and knew it was Jessica. She bumped me again and 
giggled. 

I watched myself tumbling down on the screen. Sucked into the bottomless 
slime pit. 

Thwuck thwuck thwuck. I died. 

I spun around angrily. “Jessica—!” 

“My turn!” She grinned at me, her wide, toothy grin. 

“Now we have to start all over again!” I announced. 

“No way,” Eric protested. “I’m going home.” 

“Me, too,” Joel said, pulling his baseball cap lower on his forehead. 

“One more game!” I pleaded. 

“Come on, Mark. Let’s go outside,” Joel said, pointing to the bright 
sunshine pouring through the bedroom window. 

“Yeah. It’s a great day out. Let’s throw a Frisbee or something,” Eric 
suggested. “Or get our skateboards.” 

“One more game. Then we’ll go outside,” I insisted. 

I watched them head out the door. 



I really didn’t want to leave the jungle. I don’t know why I like jungles so 
much. But I’ve been really into jungles since I was a teeny kid. 

I like to watch all the old jungle movies on TV. And when we were little, I 
used to pretend I was Tarzan, King of the Jungle. Jessica always wanted to play, 
too. So I let her be Cheetah, my talking chimpanzee. 

She was very good at it. 

But after she was six or seven, Jessica refused to be a chimp anymore. She 
became a full-time pest instead. 

“I’ll play Jungle King with you, Mark,” she offered, after my two friends 

left. 

“No way,” I replied, shaking my head. “You just want to take a dive into the 
quicksand pit.” 

“No. I’ll play it right,” she promised. “I’ll try to win this time. Really.” 

I was about to let her play when the doorbell rang downstairs. 

“Is Mom home?” I asked, listening for her footsteps. 

“I think she’s in the backyard,” Jessica replied. 

So I hurried downstairs to answer the front door. Maybe Eric and Joel 
changed their minds, I thought. Maybe they’ve come back for another round of 
Jungle King. 

I pulled open the front door. 

And stared at the grossest thing I ever saw in my life. 



2 


I stared at a head. 

A human head, wrinkled and leathery. About the size of a tennis ball. 

The pale, dry lips were pulled back in a sneer. The neck was stitched closed 
with heavy black string. The eyes—solid black eyes—stared up at me. 

A shrunken head. A real shrunken head. 

I was so shocked, so totally amazed to find it at my front door, that it took 
me a long time to see the woman who was holding it. 

She was a tall woman, about my mom’s age, maybe a little older. She had 
short black hair with streaks of gray in it. She wore a long raincoat buttoned to 
the top even though it was a warm, sunny day. 

She smiled at me. I couldn’t see her eyes. They were hidden behind large 
black-framed sunglasses. 

She held the shrunken head by the hair—thick black hair. Her other hand 
held a small canvas suitcase. 

“Are you Mark?” she asked. She had a soft, smooth voice, like someone in 
a TV commercial. 

“Uh... yeah,” I replied, staring at the shrunken head. They never looked so 
ugly in photos I’d seen. So wrinkled and dry. 

“I hope I didn’t startle you with this thing,” the woman said, smiling. “I was 
so eager to give it to you, I took it out of my bag.” 

“Uh... give it to me?” I asked, not taking my eyes off it. The head stared 
back at me with those glassy black eyes. They looked more like teddy-bear eyes 
than human eyes. 

“Your aunt Benna sent it for you,” the woman said. “As a present.” 

She held out the head to me. But I didn’t take it. I had spent all day 
collecting shrunken heads in the game. But I wasn’t sure I wanted to touch this 
one. 

“Mark—who is here?” My mom stepped up behind me. “Oh. Hello.” 

“Hello,” the woman replied pleasantly. “Did Benna write and tell you I was 
coming? I’m Carolyn Hawlings. I work with her. On the island.” 

“Oh, my goodness,” Mom exclaimed. “Benna’s letter must have gotten lost. 
Come in. Come in.” She pulled me back so that Carolyn could enter the house. 



“Look what she brought for me, Mom,” I said. 

I pointed to the small green head dangling by the hair from Carolyn’s hand. 

“Yuck!” Mom cried, raising a hand to her cheek. “That isn’t real —is it?” 

“Of course it’s real!” I cried. “Aunt Benna wouldn’t send a fake —would 
she?” 

Carolyn stepped into the living room and set down her small suitcase. I took 
a deep breath. Worked up my courage. And reached for the shrunken head. 

But before I could take it, Jessica swooped in—and grabbed it out of 
Carolyn’s hand. 

“Hey—!” I shouted, reaching for her. 

She darted away, giggling, her red hair flying behind her. Holding the head 
in both hands. 

But then she stopped. 

Her smile faded. And she stared down at the head in horror. 

“It bit me!” Jessica cried. “It bit me!” 



3 


I gasped. Mom squeezed my shoulder. 

Jessica started to giggle. 

One of her dumb jokes. 

She tossed the head from hand to hand. And grinned at me. “You’re dumb, 
Mark. You’ll believe anything.” 

“Just give me back my head!” I cried angrily. I dove across the living room 
and grabbed for it. 

She started to pull it away—but I held on tightly. 

“Hey—you scratched it!” I shrieked. 

She did. I held the head up close to my face to examine it. Jessica had 
scratched a long white line on the right earlobe. 

“Jessica—please,” Mom begged, crossing her arms and lowering her voice. 
That’s what Mom does when she’s about to get steamed. “Shape up. We have a 
guest.” 

Jessica crossed her arms and pouted back at Mom. 

Mom turned to Carolyn. “How is my sister Benna doing?” 

Carolyn pulled off her sunglasses and tucked them into a raincoat pocket. 
She had silvery-gray eyes. She looked older without the dark glasses on. I could 
see hundreds of tiny wrinkles at the corners of her eyes. 

“Benna is fine,” she replied. “Working hard. Too hard. Sometimes she 
disappears into the jungle for days.” 

Carolyn sighed and started to unbutton her raincoat. “I’m sure you know 
Benna’s work is her life,” she continued. “She spends every minute exploring the 
jungles of Baladora. She wanted to come visit. But she couldn’t leave the island. 
So she sent me instead.” 

“Well, it’s very nice to meet you, Carolyn,” Mom said warmly. “I’m sorry 
we didn’t know you were coming. But any friend of Benna’s is more than 
welcome.” 

She took Carolyn’s raincoat. Carolyn wore khaki pants and a short-sleeved 
khaki shirt. It looked like a real jungle-exploring suit. 

“Come sit down,” Mom told her. “What can I offer you?” 

“A cup of coffee would be nice,” Carolyn replied. She started to follow 



Mom to the kitchen. But she stopped and smiled at me. “Do you like your 
present?” 

I gazed down at the wrinkled, leathery head in my hands. “It’s beautiful!” I 
declared. 

That night before going to bed, I placed the head on my dresser. I brushed its 
thick black hair straight back. The forehead was dark green and wrinkled like a 
pmne. The glassy black eyes stared straight ahead. 

Carolyn told me that the head was over one hundred years old. I leaned 
against the dresser and stared at it. It was so hard to believe that it had once 
belonged to a real person. 

Yuck. 

How had the guy lost his head? I wondered. 

And who decided to shrink it? And who kept it after it was shrunk? 

I wished Aunt Benna were here. She would explain everything to me. 

Carolyn was sleeping in the guest room down the hall. We had sat in the 
living room, talking about Aunt Benna all night. Carolyn described the work 
Aunt Benna was doing on the jungle island. And the amazing things she was 
finding there on Baladora. 

My aunt Benna is a pretty famous scientist. She has been on Baladora for 
nearly ten years. She studies the animals in the jungle. And the plant life, too. 

I loved listening to Carolyn’s stories. It was as if my Jungle King computer 
game had come to life. 

Jessica kept wanting to play with my shrunken head. But I wouldn’t let her. 
She had already put a scratch on its ear. 

“It’s not a toy. It’s a human head,” I told my sister. 

“I’ll trade you two of my Koosh balls for it,” Jessica offered. 

Was she crazy? 

Why would I trade a valuable treasure like this for two Koosh balls? 

Sometimes I worried about Jessica. 

At ten o’clock, Mom sent me up to my room. “Carolyn and I have some 
things to talk about,” she announced. I said good night and made my way 
upstairs. 

I placed the shrunken head on my dresser and changed into my pajamas. 
The dark eyes in the head appeared to flash for a second when I turned out the 
lights. 



I climbed into bed and pulled up the covers. Silvery moonlight washed into 
the room from the bedroom window. In the bright moonlight, I could see the 
head clearly, staring at me from the dresser top, bathed in shadows. 

What a horrible sneer on its face, I thought with a shiver. Why is it locked 
in such a frightening expression? 

I answered my own question: You wouldn’t smile either, Mark, if someone 
shrunk your head! 

I fell asleep staring at the ugly little head. 

I slept heavily, without any dreams. 

I don’t know how long I slept. But sometime in the middle of the night, I 
was awakened by a terrifying whisper. 

“Mark... Mark...” 



4 


“Mark... Mark...” 

The eerie whisper grew louder. 

I sat straight up, and my eyes shot open. And in the heavy darkness, I saw 
Jessica, standing beside the bed. 

“Mark... Mark... ” she whispered, tugging my pajama sleeve. 

I swallowed hard. My heart pounded. “Huh? You? What’s your problem?” 

“I-I had a bad dream,” she stammered. “And I fell out of bed.” 

Jessica falls out of bed at least once a week. Mom says she’s going to build 
a tall fence around Jessica’s bed to keep her in. Or else buy her a king-size bed. 

But I think Jessica would just roll around even harder in a big bed and still 
fall out. My sister is a pest even in her sleep! 

“I need a drink of water,” she whispered, still tugging my sleeve. 

I groaned and pulled my arm away. “Well, go downstairs and get it. You’re 
not a baby,” I growled. 

“I’m scared.” She grabbed my hand and pulled. “You have to come with 

me.” 

“Jessica—!” I started to protest. But why bother? Whenever Jessica has a 
scary dream, I end up taking her downstairs for a glass of water. 

I climbed out of bed and led the way to the door. We both stopped in front 
of the dresser. The shrunken head stared out at us in the darkness. 

“I think that head gave me bad dreams,” Jessica whispered softly. 

“Don’t blame the head,” I replied, yawning. “You have bad dreams just 
about every night—remember? It’s because you have a sick mind.” 

“Do not!” she cried angrily. She punched my shoulder. Hard. 

“If you hit me, I won’t get you a drink,” I told her. 

She reached out a finger and poked the shrunken head on one of its 
wrinkled cheeks. “Yuck. It feels like leather. It doesn’t feel like skin.” 

“I guess heads get hard when you shrink them,” I said, straightening the 
thick tuft of black hair. 

“Why did Aunt Benna send you a shrunken head and not send me one?” 
Jessica asked. 



I shrugged. “Beats me.” We tiptoed out into the hall and turned toward the 
stairs. “Maybe it’s because Aunt Benna doesn’t remember you. The last time she 
visited us, you were just a baby. I was only four.” 

“Aunt Benna remembers me,” Jessica replied. She loves to argue. 

“Well, maybe she thinks that girls don’t like shrunken heads,” I said. We 
made our way down to the kitchen. The stairs squeaked under our bare feet. 

“Girls like shrunken heads,” Jessica argued. “I know I do. They’re cool.” 

I filled a glass with water and handed it to her. She made gulping sounds as 
she drank. “You’ll share your head with me—right?” she asked. 

“No way,” I told her. 

How do you share a head? 

We made our way back upstairs in the darkness. I took her to her room and 
tucked her in. Then I crept back to my room and slipped into bed. 

I yawned and pulled the covers up to my chin. 

I shut my eyes, but opened them again quickly. What was that yellow light 
across the room? 

At first, I thought someone had turned the hall light on. 

But, squinting across the room, I saw that it wasn’t a light. The head. The 
shrunken head—it was glowing! 

As if bright flames surrounded it. A shimmering yellow glow. 

And in the glow, I saw the dark eyes gleam and sparkle. 

And then the lips—the thin, dry lips that had been set in a hard scowl—the 
lips began to twitch. And the mouth pulled up in a horrifying smile. 



5 


“Nooooooo!” 

I let out a terrified wail. 

Glowing brightly, surrounded by eerie yellow light, the head grinned at me, 
its dark eyes flashing. 

My hands thrashed at the covers. I struggled to pull myself out of bed. But 
my legs tangled in the blanket, and I fell with a hard thud to the floor. 

“Nooooooo!” I cried. My body trembled so hard, I could barely scramble to 
my feet. 

Gazing up, I saw the grinning head float over the dresser. Float into the air. 
Float toward me like a glowing comet. 

No! 

I covered my face to shield myself. 

When I glanced back up, the shrunken head glowed on the dresser top. 

Had I imagined it floating up? 

I didn’t care. I ran out of the bedroom. “The head! The head!” I shrieked. 
“It’s glowing. The head is glowing!” 

Jessica jumped out as I ran past her bedroom. “Mark—what’s going on?” 
she called. 

I didn’t stop to answer. I kept on running, down the hall to Mom and Dad’s 
room. “The head!” I wailed. “The head!” I was so terrified, I didn’t know what I 
was doing! 

The door was closed. But I shoved it open without knocking. Mom was 
lying on her back on her side of the bed. My dad was away this week on a 
business trip. But Mom still slept on her side of the bed. 

As I burst in, she sat up and uttered a startled cry. “Mark?” 

I ran up beside her. “Mom—the shrunken head—it started to glow!” I cried, 
my voice high and shrill. “It’s glowing, and it—it grinned at me!” 

Mom stood up and wrapped me in a hug. She felt so warm and soft. I was 
shaking all over. I suddenly felt as if I were a little boy again. 

“Mark, you had a nightmare,” Mom said softly. She ran her hand over the 
back of my hair, the way she used to do when I was little. 

“But, Mom—” 



“That’s all it was. A nightmare. Take a deep breath. Look how you’re 
shaking.” 

I pulled away from her. I knew it wasn’t a nightmare. I’d been wide awake. 
“Come and see,” I insisted. “Hurry.” 

I pulled her out into the hall. A light clicked on in Carolyn’s room, and her 
door swung open. “What’s happening?” she asked sleepily. She was wearing a 
long black nightshirt. 

“Mark says his shrunken head glowed,” Mom reported. “I think he had a 
bad dream.” 

“No, I didn’t!” I shouted angrily. “Come on. I’ll show you!” 

I started to pull Mom down the hall. But I stopped when I saw the intense 
expression on Carolyn’s face. She had been sleepy a second ago. But now her 
eyes were wide, and she was staring at me hard. Staring at my face, studying me. 

I turned away from her and nearly bumped into Jessica. “Why did you wake 
me up?” Jessica demanded. 

I pushed past her and led everyone down the hall to my room. “The head 
glowed!” I cried. “And it smiled at me. Look. You’ll see!” 

I burst into my room and strode up to the dresser. 

The head was gone. 



6 


I stared in shock at the bare dresser top. 

Behind me, someone clicked on the bedroom light. I blinked in the bright 
light, expecting the shrunken head to appear. 

Where was it? 

My eyes searched the floor. Had it fallen and rolled away? Had it floated 
out of the room? 

“Mark—is this some kind of joke?” Mom asked. She suddenly sounded 
very tired. 

“No—” I started. “Really, Mom. The head—” 

And then I saw the sly grin on Jessica’s face. And I saw that my sister had 
both hands behind her back. 

“Jessica—what are you hiding?” I demanded. 

Her grin grew wider. She never could keep a straight face. “Nothing,” she 

lied. 

“Let me see your hands,” I said sharply. 

“No way!” she replied. But she burst out laughing and brought her hands in 
front of her. And of course she had the shrunken head gripped tightly in her right 
hand. 

“Jessica—!” I let out an angry cry and snatched it away from her. “It’s not a 
toy,” I scolded her angrily. “You keep your paws off it. Hear?” 

“Well, it wasn’t glowing,” she sneered. “And it wasn’t smiling, either. You 
made that all up, Mark.” 

“Did not!” I cried. 

I examined the head. Its dry lips were pulled back in the toothless snarl it 
always had. The skin was green and leathery, not glowing at all. 

“Mark, you had a bad dream,” Mom insisted, covering her mouth as she 
yawned. “Put the head down, and let’s all get some sleep.” 

“Okay, okay,” I muttered. I flashed Jessica another angry look. Then I set 
the shrunken head down on the dresser. 

Mom and Jessica walked out of my room. “Mark is such a jerk,” I heard 
Jessica say, just loud enough for me to hear. “I asked him to share the shrunken 
head, and he said he wouldn’t.” 



“We’ll talk about it in the morning,” Mom replied, yawning again. 

I started to turn off the light. But I stopped when I saw Carolyn, still 
standing in the hah. Still staring hard at me, a really intense expression on her 
face. 

She narrowed her silvery eyes at me. “Did you really see it glow, Mark?” 
she asked softly. 

I glanced at the head. Dark and still. “Yeah. I did,” I replied. 

Carolyn nodded. She seemed to be thinking hard about something. “Good 
night,” she murmured. Then she turned and padded silently back to the guest 
room. 

The next morning, Mom and Carolyn greeted me with the biggest surprise 
of my life. 



7 


“Your aunt Benna wants you to come visit her in the jungle,” Mom announced at 
breakfast. 

I dropped the spoon into my Froot Loops. My mouth fell open to my knees. 
“Excuse me?” 

Mom and Carolyn grinned at me. I guess they enjoyed shocking me. 
“That’s why Carolyn came,” Mom explained. “To take you back with her to 
Baladora.” 

“Wh-why didn’t you tell me?” I shrieked. 

“We didn’t want to tell you until we worked out all the details,” Mom 
replied. “Are you excited? You get to visit a real jungle!” 

“Excited isn’t the word!” I exclaimed. “I’m... I’m... I’m... I don’t know 
what I am!” 

They both laughed. 

“I get to go, too!” Jessica declared, bouncing into the kitchen. 

I let out a groan. 

“No, Jessica. You can’t go this time,” Mom said, putting a hand on my 
sister’s shoulder. “This is Mark’s turn.” 

“That isn’t fair!” Jessica wailed, shoving Mom’s hand away. 

“Yes, it is,” I replied happily. “Kah-lee-ah!” I cheered. Then I leaped to my 
feet and did a celebration dance around the kitchen table. 

“Not fair! Not fair!” Jessica chanted. 

“Jessica, you don’t like jungles,” I reminded her. 

“Yes, I do!” she insisted. 

“Next time will be your turn,” Carolyn said, taking a long sip of coffee. 
“I’m sure your aunt would love to show you the jungle, Jessica.” 

“Yeah. When you’re older,” I sneered. “You know, the jungle is too 
dangerous for a kid.” 

Of course, when I said that to my sister, I had no idea of just how dangerous 
the jungle could be. No idea that I was heading toward dangers I couldn’t even 
imagine. 

After breakfast, Mom helped me pack my suitcase. I wanted to bring shorts and 



T-shirts. I knew it was hot in the jungle. 

But Carolyn insisted that I pack long-sleeved shirts and jeans, because of 
the scratchy weeds and vines we’d be walking through. And because of all the 
jungle insects. 

“You have to protect yourself from the sun,” Carolyn instructed. “Baladora 
is so close to the equator. The sun is very strong. And the temperature stays in 
the nineties all day.” 

Of course I carefully packed the shrunken head. I didn’t want Jessica to get 
her paws on it while I was away. 

I know, I know. Sometimes I’m pretty mean to my sister. 

As we drove to the airport, I thought about poor Jessica, staying home 
while I went off to exciting adventures with Aunt Benna. 

I decided to bring her back a really cool souvenir from the jungle. Some 
poison ivy, maybe. Or some kind of poisonous snake. Ha-ha! 

At the airport, Mom kept hugging me and telling me to be careful. Then she 
hugged me some more. It was really pretty embarrassing. 

Finally, it came time for Carolyn and me to board the plane. I felt scared 
and excited and glad and worried—all at once! 

“Be sure to send postcards!” Mom called as I followed Carolyn to the gate. 

“If I can find a mailbox!” I called back. 

I didn’t think they had mailboxes in the jungle. 

The flight was very long. So long, they showed three movies in a row! 

Carolyn spent a lot of time reading through her notebooks and papers. But 
when the flight attendants served dinner, she took a break. And she told me 
about the work Aunt Benna had been doing in the jungle. 

Carolyn said that Aunt Benna had made many exciting discoveries. She had 
discovered two kinds of plants that no one had ever seen before. One is a kind of 
crawling vine that she named after herself. Benna-lepticus. Or something like 
that. 

Carolyn said that Aunt Benna was exploring parts of the jungle where no 
one had ever gone. And that she was turning up all kinds of jungle secrets. 
Secrets that will make Aunt Benna famous when she decides to announce them. 

“When was the last time your aunt visited you?” Carolyn asked. She 
struggled to pull open the plastic wrapping around her silverware. 

“A long time ago,” I told her. “I can hardly remember what Aunt Benna 



looks like. I was only four or five.” 

Carolyn nodded. “Did she give you any special presents?” she asked. She 
pulled out the plastic knife and started to spread butter on her dinner roll. 

I scrunched up my face, thinking hard. “Special presents?” 

“Did she bring you anything from the jungle when she visited you?” 
Carolyn asked. She lowered the dinner roll to the tray and turned to me. 

She had her dark glasses on again, so I couldn’t see her eyes. But I had the 
feeling she was staring at me, studying me. 

“I don’t remember,” I replied. “I know she didn’t bring me anything as cool 
as a shrunken head. That head is really awesome!” 

Carolyn didn’t smile. She turned back to her food tray. I could tell she was 
thinking hard about something. 

I fell asleep after dinner. We flew all night and landed in Southeast Asia. 

We arrived just after dawn. The sky outside the airplane window was a deep 
purple. A beautiful color I’d never seen before. A big red sun rose slowly 
through the purple. 

“We change planes here,” Carolyn announced. “A huge jet like this could 
never land in Baladora. We have to take a tiny plane from here.” 

The plane was tiny, for sure. It looked like a toy. It was painted a dull red. It 
had two red propellers on the slender wings. I searched for the rubber bands that 
made the propellers spin! 

Carolyn introduced me to the pilot. He was a young man in a red-and- 
yellow Hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts. He had slicked-down black hair and a 
black mustache. His name was Ernesto. 

“Can this thing fly?” I asked him. 

He grinned at me from beneath the mustache. “I hope so,” he replied, 
chuckling. 

He helped us up metal steps into the cabin. Then he hoisted himself into the 
cockpit. Carolyn and I filled the cabin. There was only room for the two of us 
back there! 

When Ernesto started the engine, it chugged and sputtered like a power 
mower starting up. 

The propellers began to twirl. The engine roared. So loud I couldn’t hear 
what Ernesto was shouting to us. 

Finally I figured out that he was telling us to fasten our seat belts. 

I swallowed hard and stared out the tiny window. Ernesto backed the plane 



out of the hangar. The roar was so loud, I wanted to cover my ears. 

This is going to be exciting, I thought. It’s kind of like flying inside a kite! 

A few minutes later, we were in the air, flying low over the blue-green 
ocean. The bright morning sunlight made the water sparkle. 

The plane bumped and jerked. I could feel the wind blowing it, making us 
bounce. 

After a while, Carolyn pointed out the islands down below. They were 
mostly green, with ribbons of yellow sand around them. 

“Those are all jungle islands,” Carolyn told me. “See that one?” She 
pointed to a large, egg-shaped island. “Some people found buried pirate’s 
treasure on that island. Gold and jewels worth millions of dollars.” 

“Cool!” I exclaimed. 

Ernesto leaned over the throttle and brought the plane lower. So low I could 
clearly make out trees and shrubs. The trees all seemed tangled together. I 
couldn’t see any roads or paths. 

The ocean water darkened to a deep green. The engine roared as the plane 
bounced against strong winds. 

“That’s Baladora up ahead!” Carolyn announced. She pointed out the 
window as another island came into view. Baladora was larger than the other 
islands, and very jagged. It curved around like a crescent moon. 

“I can’t believe that Aunt Benna is down there somewhere!” I exclaimed. 

Carolyn smiled beneath her dark glasses. “She’s there, okay.” 

I glanced to the front as Ernesto turned in his seat to face us. I saw instantly 
that he had a troubled expression on his face. 

“We have a little problem,” he said, shouting over the roar of the engine. 

“Problem?” Carolyn asked. 

Ernesto nodded grimly. “Yes. A problem. You see... I don’t know how to 
land this thing. You two will have to jump.” 

Panic made me gasp. “But—but—but—” I sputtered. “We don’t have 
parachutes!” 

Ernesto shrugged. “Try to land on something soft,” he said.

My mouth dropped open. My breath caught in my chest. Both hands gripped the 
arms of the seat. 

Then I saw the smile on Carolyn’s face. She shook her head, her eyes on 
Ernesto. “Mark is too smart for you,” she told him. “He’s not going to fall for a 
dumb joke like that.” 

Ernesto laughed. He narrowed his dark eyes at me. “You believed me— 
right?” 

“Ha-ha. No way!” I choked out. My knees were still shaking. “I knew you 
were kidding,” I lied. “Kind of.” 

Carolyn and Ernesto both laughed. “You’re mean,” she told Ernesto. 

Ernesto’s eyes flashed. His smile faded. “You’ve got to get used to thinking 
fast in the jungle,” he warned. 

He turned back to the controls. I kept my eyes out the window, watching the 
island of Baladora sweep beneath us. Broad-winged white birds swooped over 
the tangled green trees. 

A short strip of land had been cleared near the south shore of the island. 
Beyond it, I could see ocean waves smacking against dark rocks. 

The little plane hit hard as we landed—hard enough to make my knees 
bounce up in the air. We bounced again on the bumpy, dirt landing strip. Then 
we rolled to a stop. 

Ernesto cut the engine. He pushed open the cabin door. Then he helped us 
out of the plane. We had to duck our heads. 

Ernesto carried our suitcases out. Carolyn had her small canvas bag. My 
suitcase was a little larger. He set them down on the landing strip and gave us a 
short, two-fingered salute. Then he climbed back into the little red plane and 
pulled the door closed behind him. 

I shut my eyes as the propellers whirred, showering sand over me. A few 
seconds later, Ernesto took off. The plane nosed up steeply, just barely making it 
over the trees at the end of the landing strip. 

The plane turned sharply and headed back over the water. Carolyn and I 
picked up our bags. “Where do we go now?” I asked, squinting in the bright 
sunlight. 



Carolyn pointed. A clearing of tall grass stretched beyond the narrow, dirt 
airstrip. At the edge of the clearing where the trees started, I could see a row of 
low gray buildings. 

“That’s our headquarters,” Carolyn told me. “We built the airstrip right next 
to it. The rest of the island is jungle. No roads. No other houses. Just 
wilderness.” 

“Do you get cable?” I asked. 

She stopped short. Then laughed. I don’t think she expected me to make a 

joke. 

We carried our suitcases toward the low gray buildings. The morning sun 
was still low in the sky. But the air was already hot and wet. Hundreds of tiny 
white insects—some kind of gnat—hovered over the tall grass, darting one way 
then the other. 

I heard shrill buzzing. And somewhere in the distance, the high cry of a 
bird, followed by a long, sad reply. 

Carolyn walked quickly, taking long strides over the tall grass, ignoring the 
darting white gnats. I jogged to keep up with her. 

Sweat ran down my forehead. The back of my neck started to itch. 

Why was Carolyn in such a hurry? 

“We’re kind of trapped here, right?” I said, studying the low, twisted trees 
beyond the small headquarters buildings. “I mean, how do we get off the island 
when we’re finished?” 

“We radio for Ernesto,” Carolyn replied, not slowing her pace. “It takes him 
about an hour to get here from the mainland.” 

That made me feel a little better. I scurried over the tall grass, struggling to 
keep up with Carolyn. 

My suitcase began to feel heavy. I wiped sweat from my eyes with my free 
hand. 

We were nearing the headquarters. I expected Aunt Benna to come running 
out to greet me. But I couldn’t see any sign of anyone. 

A radio antenna was perched off to the side. The low buildings were 
perfectly square. Flat-roofed. They looked like upside-down cartons. Square 
windows had been cut in each wall. 

“What is that stretched over all the windows?” I asked Carolyn. 

“Mosquito netting,” she replied. She turned back to me. “Have you ever 
seen a mosquito as big as your head?” 



I laughed. “No.” 

“Well, you will.” 

I laughed again. She was joking—right? 

We stepped up to the first building, the largest in the row. I set down my 
suitcase, pulled off my baseball cap, and mopped my forehead with my 
shirtsleeve. Wow. It was hot. 

A screen door led into the building. Carolyn held it open for me. 

“Aunt Benna—!” I cried eagerly. Leaving the suitcase on the ground, I ran 
inside. “Aunt Benna?” 

Sunlight filtered through the netting over the window. It took a few seconds 
for my eyes to adjust to the darker light. 

I saw a table cluttered with test tubes and other equipment. I saw a 
bookshelf filled with notebooks and books. 

“Aunt Benna?” 

Then I saw her. Wearing a white lab coat. Standing with her back to me, at a 
sink against the wall. 

She turned, wiping her hands on a towel. 

No. 

Not Aunt Benna. 

A man. A white-haired man in a white lab coat. 

His hair was thick and brushed straight back. Even in the dim light, I could 
see the pale blue of his eyes, blue as the sky. Such strange eyes. They looked like 
blue glass. Like marbles. 

He smiled. Not at me. 

He was smiling at Carolyn. 

He motioned to me by tilting his head. “Does he have it?” he asked 
Carolyn. He had a scratchy, hoarse voice. 

Carolyn nodded. “Yes. He has it.” I could see that she was breathing hard. 
Short, shallow breaths. 

Was she excited? Nervous? 

A smile crossed the man’s face. His blue eyes appeared to twinkle. 

“Hi,” I said awkwardly. I felt really confused. What did that question mean? 
What did I have? 

“Where is my aunt Benna?” I asked. 

Before he could answer, a girl appeared from the back room. She had 
straight blond hair and the same pale blue eyes. She was dressed in a white T- 



shirt and white tennis shorts. She appeared to be about my age. 

“This is my daughter Kareen,” the man said in his hoarse voice, more like a 
whisper. “I am Dr. Richard Hawlings.” He turned to Kareen. “This is Benna’s 
nephew. Mark.” 

“Tell me something I don’t know,” Kareen replied sharply, rolling her eyes. 
She turned to me. “Hey, Mark.” 

“Hi,” I replied. Still confused. 

Kareen flipped her blond hair back over the shoulders of her T-shirt. “What 
grade are you in?” 

“Sixth,” I told her. 

“Me, too. Except I’m not in school this term. I’m in this dump.” She 
frowned at her father. 

“Where is my aunt?” I asked Dr. Hawlings. “Is she working or something? I 
thought she’d be here. You know. When I arrived.” 

Dr. Hawlings stared at me with those strange blue eyes. It took him a long 
time to reply. Finally, he said, “Benna isn’t here.” 

“Excuse me?” I wasn’t sure I’d heard him correctly. It was hard to 
understand his raspy voice. “Is she... uh... working?” 

“We don’t know,” he replied. 

Kareen played with a strand of her hair. She twisted it around her finger, 
staring at me. 

Carolyn stepped behind the lab table and leaned her elbows on it. She rested 
her head in her hands. “Your aunt Benna is missing,” she said. 

Her words made my head spin. 

They were so unexpected. And she said them so flatly. Without any feeling 
at all. 

“She’s... missing !” 

“She’s been missing for a few weeks,” Kareen said, glancing at her father. 
“The three of us—we’ve been trying really hard to find her.” 

“I-I don’t understand,” I stammered. I shoved my hands into my jeans 
pockets. 

“Your aunt is lost in the jungle,” Dr. Hawlings explained. 

“But—Carolyn said—” I started. 

Dr. Hawlings raised a hand to silence me. “Your aunt is lost in the jungle, 
Mark.” 

“But-but why didn’t you tell my mom?” I asked, confused. 



“We didn’t want to worry her,” Dr. Hawlings replied. “Benna’s your mom’s 
sister, after all. So Carolyn brought you here because you can help us find her.” 

“Huh?” My mouth dropped open in shock. “Me? How can I help?” 

Dr. Hawlings stepped across the small room toward me. His eyes locked on 
mine. “You can help us, Mark,” he said in his hoarse whisper. “You can help us 
find Benna—because you have Jungle Magic.” 



9 


“I have what?” 

I stared at Dr. Hawlings. I didn’t know what he was talking about. 

Was Jungle Magic some kind of computer game? Was it like Jungle King? 

Why did he think I had it? 

“You have Jungle Magic,” he repeated, staring back at me with those 
amazing blue eyes. “Let me explain.” 

“Daddy, give Mark a break,” Kareen interrupted. “He’s been flying for a 
hundred hours. He must be wrecked!” 

I shrugged. “Yeah. I’m a little tired.” 

“Come sit down,” Carolyn said. She led me over to a tall stool beside the 
lab table. Then she turned to Kareen. “Do we have any Cokes left?” 

Kareen pulled open a small refrigerator against the back wall. “A few,” she 
replied, bending down to get to the bottom shelf. “Ernesto is supposed to bring 
another carton on his next flight.” 

Kareen brought me a can of Coke. I popped it open and tilted the can to my 
mouth. The cold liquid felt so good on my hot, dry throat. 

Kareen leaned against the table, close to me. “Have you ever been to a 
jungle before?” 

I swallowed more Coke. “No. Not really. But I’ve seen a lot of jungle 
movies.” 

Kareen laughed. “It’s not like in the movies. I mean, there aren’t herds of 
gazelles and elephants gathering at the water hole. At least, not on Baladora.” 

“What animals are on the island?” I asked. 

“Mosquitoes, mostly,” Kareen answered. 

“There are some beautiful red birds,” Carolyn said. “Called scarlet ibises. 
You won’t believe their color. Kind of like flamingos, only much brighter.” 

Dr. Hawlings had been studying me the whole while. He walked over to the 
table and dropped down onto a stool across from me. 

I held the cold soda can against my hot forehead. Then I lowered it to the 
table. “Tell me about my aunt Benna,” I said to him. 

“Not much to tell,” Dr. Hawlings replied, frowning. “She was studying a 
new kind of tree snail. Somewhere on this end of the jungle. But one night she 



didn’t return.” 

“We’re very worried about her,” Carolyn said, twisting a strand of hair. She 
bit her lower lip. “Very worried. We searched and searched. Then we decided 
you could help us.” 

“But how can I help?” I demanded. “I told you—I’ve never been to a 
jungle.” 

“But you have Jungle Magic,” Carolyn replied. “Benna gave it to you. The 
last time she visited you. We read about it. It’s in Benna’s notebooks over there.” 

Carolyn pointed to a stack of black notebooks on the bookshelf against the 
wall. I gazed at them, thinking hard. I still didn’t understand. 

“Aunt Benna gave me some kind of magic?” I asked. 

Dr. Hawlings nodded. “Yes, she did. She was afraid the secret might fall 
into the wrong hands. So she gave it to you.” 

“Don’t you remember?” Carolyn asked. 

“I was so little,” I told them. “I was only four. I don’t remember. I don’t 
think she gave me anything.” 

“But she did,” Carolyn insisted. “We know you have Jungle Magic. We 
know that you—” 

“How?” I interrupted. “How do you know I have it?” 

“Because you saw the shrunken head glow,” Carolyn replied. “The head 
will only glow for people who have the magic. We read that in Benna’s 
notebooks.” 

I swallowed hard. My throat suddenly felt dry again. My heart began to 

race. 

“You’re telling me I have some special kind of magic powers?” I asked in a 
tiny voice. “But I don’t feel strange or anything. I’ve never done anything 
magic!” 

“You have the magic,” Dr. Hawlings said softly. “The magic is hundreds of 
years old. It belonged to the Oloyan people. They used to live on this island.” 

“They were headshrinkers,” Carolyn added. “Hundreds of years ago. That 
head I brought you—it was Oloyan. We have uncovered many others.” 

“But your aunt uncovered the secret of their ancient magic,” Dr. Hawlings 
said. “And she gave it to you.” 

“You’ve got to help us find her!” Kareen declared. “You’ve got to use the 
magic. We’ve got to find poor Benna—before it’s too late.” 

“I-I’ll try,” I told them. 



But secretly, I thought: They’ve made a big mistake. 
Maybe they mixed me up with someone else. 

I don’t have any Jungle Magic. None at all. 

What am I going to do? 



10 


I spent the day exploring the edge of the jungle with Kareen. We uncovered 
some amazing yellow spiders that were nearly as big as my fist. And Kareen 
showed me a plant that can snap its leaves closed around an insect and keep it 
trapped for days until the plant has digested it all. 

Pretty cool. 

We climbed low, smooth-barked trees. We sat in the tree limbs and talked. 

Kareen is okay, I think. She’s very serious. She doesn’t laugh a whole lot. 
And she doesn’t like the jungle at all. 

Kareen’s mom died when she was a little kid. She wants to go back to New 
Jersey and live with her grandmother. But her father won’t let her. 

As I talked with her, I kept thinking about Jungle Magic. And I kept 
thinking about how—whatever it was—I didn’t have it. 

Sure, I always liked jungle movies. And jungle books and jungle games. I 
always thought jungles were really awesome. But that doesn’t mean I have any 
special powers or anything. 

And now Aunt Benna was missing. And her friends on Baladora were so 
desperate to find her, they had brought me here. 

But what could I do? 

What? 

As I lay in bed that night, the questions didn’t go away. 

I stared up at the low ceiling of the small wooden shack, wide awake. There 
were six or seven flat-roofed shacks in a row, behind the main building. We each 
had our own little shack to sleep in. 

My little cabin had a narrow bed with a flat, lumpy mattress. A low bedside 
table where I placed my shrunken head. A small dresser with all the drawers 
stuck except the bottom one. A narrow closet, just big enough for the clothes I’d 
brought. And a tiny bathroom in the back. 

Through the netting over the open window, I could hear the chirp of insects. 
And in the distance, I heard a caww caww cawww. Some sort of animal cry. 

How can I help find Aunt Benna? I wondered as I stared up at the dark 
ceiling and listened to the strange sounds. 

What can I do? 



I tried to remember her. I tried to remember her visit to my house when I 
was four. 

I pictured a short, dark-haired woman. Chubby like me. A round pink face. 
Intense dark eyes. 

I remembered that she talked very fast. She had sort of a chirpy voice, and 
she always seemed excited. Very enthusiastic. 

And I remembered... 

Nothing else. 

That’s all I could remember about my aunt. 

Did she give me Jungle Magic? No. I didn’t remember anything about that. 

I mean, how do you give someone magic? 

I kept thinking about it and thinking about it. I struggled to remember more 
about her visit. 

But I couldn’t. 

I knew that Carolyn and Dr. Hawlings had made a terrible mistake. I’ll tell 
them in the morning, I decided. I’ll tell them they got the wrong kid. 

A terrible mistake... terrible mistake. The words repeated in my mind. 

I sat up. No way I could get to sleep. My brain wouldn’t let me. I was wide 
awake. 

I decided to take a walk around the headquarters building. Maybe explore 
back where the trees grew thick and the jungle started. 

I crept to the screen door and peered out. My little cabin stood at the end of 
the row. I could see the other cabins from my door. All dark. Kareen, Carolyn, 
and Dr. Hawlings had gone to sleep. 

Cawwww cawwwww. The strange cry repeated in the distance. A soft wind 
made the tall grass bend and shift. Tree leaves rustled, making a whispering 
sound. 

I was wearing a long, baggy T-shirt pulled down over boxers. No need to 
get dressed, I decided. No one else is awake. Besides, I’ll just take a very short 
walk. 

I slipped into my sandals. Pushed open the screen door. And stepped 
outside. 

Cawwww cawwwww. The cry sounded a little closer. 

The night air felt hot and wet, nearly as hot as during the day. A heavy dew 
had fallen, and my sandals slid over the damp, tall grass. The wet grass tickled 
my feet through the sandals. 



I made my way past the silent, dark shacks. To my right, the trees bent and 
swayed. Black shadows against a purple sky. No moon. No stars tonight. 

Maybe taking a walk is a bad idea, I told myself. Maybe it’s too dark. 

I need a flashlight, I realized. I remembered Carolyn’s warning earlier when 
she showed me where I would sleep. “Never go out at night without a flashlight. 
At night,” she had warned me, “we are not in charge here. At night, this is the 
creatures’ world.” 

The back of the headquarters building loomed ahead of me. I decided to 
turn around. 

But before I could turn, I realized I wasn’t alone. 

In the darkness, I caught a pair of eyes, staring back at me. 

I gasped. A chill ran down my back. 

Staring hard through the purple night, I saw another pair of eyes. 

And then another and another. 

Dark eyes, staring at me without moving, without blinking. 

Dark eyes, on top of each other. 

I froze. I couldn’t move. 

I knew that I was trapped. There were too many of them. Too many. 



11 


My legs trembled. Chill after chill rolled down the back of my neck. 

And as I stared at the eyes, the dark eyes in pairs, eyes on top of eyes—as I 
stared at them, they began to glow. 

Brighter. Brighter. 

And in the golden light, I saw that these were not creature eyes. 

These were not animal eyes. 

These were human eyes. 

I stared at the glowing eyes of a hundred shrunken heads! 

A pile of shrunken heads. A11 heaped together. Eyes on top of eyes. Heads 
like tight fists, mouths curled into snarls, or open in toothless horror. 

Heads on heads. Dark and wrinkled and leathery. 

So terrifying in the cold golden glow from their eyes. 

I uttered a choked cry—and took off. 

My legs felt rubbery and weak. My heart pounded in my chest. I ran around 
the headquarters building, the yellow glow fading slowly from my eyes. I ran as 
fast as I could. To the front of the dark building. To the screen door. 

Gasping for breath, I pulled open the door. And leaped inside. 

I pressed my back against the wall and waited. Waited for the eerie glow to 
fade completely. Waited for my heart to stop racing, for my breathing to slow. 

After a minute or two, I began to feel a little calmer. 

Those heads, I wondered. Why are they piled back there like that? 

I shook my head hard, trying to shake away the ugly picture of them. They 
were all people once, I realized. Hundreds of years ago, they were people. 

And now... 

I swallowed hard. My throat felt tight and dry. 

I started across the room to the refrigerator. I need something cold to drink, 
I told myself. I bumped the edge of the lab table. 

My hands shot out, and I knocked something over. I grabbed it before it 
rolled off the table. 

A flashlight. 

“Hey—!” I cried out happily. 



I’m going to listen to Carolyn’s advice from now on, I promised myself. 
I’m never going out again without a flashlight. 

I pushed the button, and a white beam of light swept over the floor. As I 
raised the flashlight, the light settled on the bookshelf against the wall. 

Aunt Benna’s black notebooks flashed into view. A tall stack of them nearly 
filled the shelf. 

I moved quickly to the bookshelf. With my free hand, I pulled down the top 
notebook. It was heavier than I thought, and I almost dropped it. 

Cradling it in my arms, I carried it over to the lab table. I climbed onto the 
tall stool and opened it up. 

Maybe I can find some answers in here, I thought. 

Maybe I can find the part where Aunt Benna talks about giving me Jungle 
Magic. Maybe I can find out why Dr. Hawlings and Carolyn think I have it. 

I leaned over the notebook and aimed the light onto the pages. Then I began 
flipping through, page after page, squinting in the light. 

Luckily, my aunt has big, bold handwriting. Very clean and easy to read. 

The pages seemed to be organized by year. I kept flipping pages, scanning 
each page quickly—until I came to the year of her visit. 

My eyes rolled down over a long section about lizards. Some kind of tree 
lizards that Aunt Benna was studying. 

Then she described a cave she had found, cut into the rocky shore at the 
other side of the island. The cave, she wrote, had been lived in by the Oloyans, 
maybe two hundred years ago. 

I skimmed over long lists of things Aunt Benna had found in the cave. Her 
handwriting got very jagged, very crooked here. I guess she was really excited 
by her discovery. 

I turned several more pages. And started a section marked “Summer”. 

As I read the words, my mouth dropped open. My eyes nearly bulged out of 
my head. 

The words started to blur. I lowered the flashlight to the page so that I could 
see better. I blinked several times. 

I didn’t want to believe what I was reading. 

I didn’t want to believe what Aunt Benna had written. 

But the words were there. 

And they were terrifying. 



12 


The flashlight shook in my hand. I steadied it between both hands. Then I leaned 
forward and read Aunt Benna’s words, moving my lips silently as I read. 

“Dr. Hawlings and his sister Carolyn will stop at nothing to destroy the 
jungle and all the creatures who live here,” my aunt wrote in her bold, clear 
handwriting. “They do not care who they hurt or who they kill. They care only 
about getting what they want.” 

I swallowed hard. Steadied the circle of light over the notebook page. And 
kept reading. 

“Finding the secret of Jungle Magic in that cave was my most amazing 
discovery,” Aunt Benna wrote. “But I know the secret is not safe as long as Dr. 
Hawlings and Carolyn are around. They will use the Jungle Magic to do evil. 
And so I have given the Jungle Magic and its secret to my nephew Mark. He 
lives four thousand miles away in the United States. And so I hope the secret 
will be safe. 

“If the Jungle Magic ever falls into Hawlings’ hands,” my aunt continued, 
“the jungle will be destroyed. The island of Baladora will be destroyed. And so 
will I.” 

I gasped and turned the page. I struggled to keep the flashlight steady so 
that I could read more. 

“If Hawlings gets the Jungle Magic,” Aunt Benna wrote, “he will shrink my 
head until there is no trace of me. I must keep my nephew four thousand miles 
away from Hawlings. Because he will shrink Mark’s head, too, to get at the 
magic I have hidden there.” 

“Ohhhh.” A terrified moan escaped my throat. 

Shrink my head? 

Dr. Hawlings will shrink my head? 

I read the last words again: “I must keep my nephew four thousand miles 
away...” 

But I’m not four thousand miles away! I told myself. 

I’m here. I’m right here! 

Carolyn brought me here to steal the magic. To take it from me. She and Dr. 
Hawlings planned to shrink my head! 



I slammed the notebook shut. I took a deep breath and held it. But it didn’t 
help to slow the thudding of my heart. 

What have they done to Aunt Benna? I wondered. 

Did they try to get the secret from her? Did they do something terrible to 

her? 

Or did she run away from them? Did she escape? 

Did they bring me here to track her down so that they could capture her 
again? Then when I find her, do they plan to shrink both of our heads? 

“Nooooo,” I murmured, trying to stop my body from trembling. 

I thought they were my friends. My friends... 

But I’m not safe here, I told myself. I’m in terrible danger. 

I have to get away. Get dressed and get away from these evil people. As fast 
as I can. 

I dropped off the stool, turned, and started toward the door. 

Got to get out. Got to get away. 

The words repeated in rhythm with my pounding heart. 

I reached for the screen door. Started to push it open. 

But someone was standing there. Standing there in the deep shadows, 
blocking my escape. 

“Where do you think you’re going?” a voice called. 



13 


Kareen pulled open the door and stepped into the room. She wore an oversized 
T-shirt, down past her knees. Her blond hair was wild about her face. “What are 
you doing in here?” she demanded. 

“Let me go!” I cried. I raised the flashlight like a weapon. 

She took a step back. “Hey—!” She let out a startled cry. 

“I have to go,” I insisted, pushing past her. 

“Mark—what’s your problem?” she asked. “Why are you acting so crazy?” 

I stopped with the screen door half open, my shoulder against the frame. “I 
saw Aunt Benna’s notebook,” I told Kareen, shining the flashlight beam on her 
face. “I read what Aunt Benna said. About your father. And about Carolyn.” 

“Oh.” Kareen let out a long sigh. 

I kept the harsh light on her face. She squinted at me, then covered her eyes 
with her arm. 

“Where is my aunt?” I demanded sharply. “Do you know where she is?” 

“No,” Kareen replied. “Lower the light—okay? You don’t have to blind 

me.” 

I lowered the light. “Did your father do something terrible to my aunt? Did 
he hurt Aunt Benna?” 

“No!” Kareen screamed. “How can you ask that, Mark? My father isn’t 
evil. He and Benna just don’t agree about some things.” 

“You’re sure you don’t know where my aunt is? Is she hiding somewhere? 
Hiding from your father? Is she still on the island?” The questions leaped out of 
me. I wanted to grab Kareen and force her to tell me the truth. 

She tugged at both sides of her blond hair. “We don’t know where your aunt 
is. We really don’t,” she insisted. “That’s why Carolyn brought you here. To help 
us find her. We’re worried about Benna. We really are.” 

“That’s a lie!” I cried angrily. “I read my aunt’s notebook. Your father isn’t 
worried about my aunt.” 

“Well, I am,” Kareen insisted. “I like your aunt a lot. She’s been really nice 
to me. I don’t care about Daddy and Aunt Carolyn and their arguments with 
Benna. I’m worried about Benna. I really am.” 

I raised the flashlight again. I wanted to check out Kareen’s expression. I 



wanted to see if she was telling the truth. 

Her blue eyes flashed in the light. I saw a teardrop running down one cheek. 
I decided she was being honest with me. 

“Well, if you’re worried about my aunt, help me get away from here,” I 
said, lowering the light again. 

“Okay, I’ll help you,” she answered quickly, without having to think about 
it. 

I pushed open the screen door and crept outside. Kareen followed. She 
closed the door silently behind her. “Turn off the light,” she whispered. “We 
don’t want Daddy or Carolyn to see.” 

I clicked off the light and started over the wet grass toward my cabin, 
walking fast. Kareen hurried to keep at my side. 

“I’ll get dressed,” I whispered. “Then I’m going to try to find Aunt Benna.” 
A shudder swept down my back. “But how? Where should I go?” 

“Use the Jungle Magic,” Kareen whispered. “It’ll tell you where Benna is. 
It’ll tell you where to go.” 

“But I can’t!” I cried shrilly. “Up until today, I didn’t even know I had any 
kind of magic. I’m still not sure I believe it.” 

“Use the magic—” Kareen whispered, narrowing her eyes at me. 

“But I don’t know how!” I insisted. 

“The magic will guide you,” she replied. “I’m sure it will. I’m sure it will 
show you the way.” 

I wasn’t so sure. But I didn’t say anything. 

My mind was spinning. Aunt Benna’s written words kept weaving through 
my thoughts. 

I should be four thousand miles away, I told myself. I’m only safe if I’m 
four thousand miles away. 

Now, how will I escape from Carolyn and Dr. Hawlings? 

How? 

We were striding down the row of cabins. The air still felt hot and wet, 
heavy. The sky had darkened to black. There were still no stars, no moon. 

I’ll get dressed, and I’ll get away, I told myself. 

Get dressed. Get away. 

“Hurry, Mark,” Kareen whispered at my side. “Hurry. And don’t make a 
sound. Daddy is a very light sleeper.” 

My cabin came into view at the end of the row. 



But before I could reach it, I heard the soft thud of footsteps on the grass. 
Rapid footsteps. 

Kareen gasped and grabbed my arm. “Oh, no! It’s him!” 



14 


I think I jumped a foot in the air. 

Should I run? Try to hide? 

If this was a game of Jungle King, I’d know the right moves. I’d know how 
to escape from the Evil Scientist. I’d grab a vine and swing myself to safety. And 
pick up a few extra lives along the way. 

But, of course, this was no game. 

I pressed my back against the cabin wall and froze there, waiting to be 
caught. 

The rapid footsteps thudded closer. 

I held my breath, but my heart still pounded. 

I held my breath—and watched a funny-looking animal hop into view. 

Not Dr. Hawlings. But a weird-looking rabbit, with huge ears and big paws 
that thudded the ground as it hopped. 

I watched the weird creature dart away, disappearing between two of the 
low cabins. “Is it a rabbit?” 

Kareen raised a finger to her lips, reminding me to be quiet. “It’s a new 
species of giant rabbit your aunt discovered.” 

“Very educational,” I murmured. “But do I need a nature lesson now?” 

Kareen pushed me by the shoulders toward my cabin door. “Hurry, Mark. If 
my dad wakes up...” She didn’t finish her sentence. 

If he wakes up, he’ll shrink my head. I finished the sentence for her. 

My legs suddenly felt as if they were about to collapse. But I forced myself 
into my dark cabin. 

My hands were shaking so hard, I could barely get dressed. I pulled on the 
jeans I’d been wearing that day. And a long-sleeved T-shirt. 

“Hurry!” Kareen whispered from the door. “Hurry up!” 

I wished she’d stop saying that. I jumped every time. 

“Hurry, Mark!” 

I pulled open my suitcase and grabbed the flashlight I’d brought. Then I 
started to the door. 

“Hurry, Mark. Get going!” Kareen whispered. 



I stopped halfway across the cabin. Grabbed the shrunken head. Stuffed it 
into my T-shirt pocket. Then I pushed open the door and stepped back outside. 

Where should I go? What should I do? How could I find my aunt? 

A million questions rushed through my mind. My throat felt so dry, it 
ached. I thought about getting one of those cold Cokes in the lab. But I knew I 
couldn’t risk waking Kareen’s father. 

We started walking across the wet grass. “Don’t turn on the flashlight until 
you’re hidden by the trees,” Kareen instructed. 

“But where do I go? How do I find Aunt Benna?” I whispered, swallowing 

hard. 

“There’s only one path,” Kareen told me, pointing to the tangled dark trees 
at the edge of the clearing. “It will lead you part of the way.” 

“Then what?” I demanded, my voice shaking. 

Her eyes locked on mine. “The Jungle Magic will take you the rest of the 
way.” 

Yeah. Sure. 

And next week, I’ll flap my arms and fly to the moon. 

I had the sudden urge to turn around. Go back to my little shack. Go to bed 
and pretend I never read my aunt’s notebook. 

But then Kareen and I passed the big pile of shrunken heads. The dark eyes 
all seemed to stare up at me. Such sad, sad eyes. 

I don’t want my head to end up on that pile, I decided. No way! 

I started to jog toward the trees. 

Kareen hurried to keep up with me. “Good luck, Mark!” she called softly. 

“Th-thanks,” I stammered. Then I stopped and turned to her. “What are you 
going to tell your dad in the morning?” 

Kareen shrugged. The wind blew her blond hair around her face. “I won’t 
tell him anything,” she said. “I’ll tell him I slept all night. That I didn’t hear a 
thing.” 

“Thanks,” I repeated. Then gripping the flashlight tightly, I turned and ran 
into the trees. 

The path was soft and sandy. The sand felt wet through my sandals. Vines 
and big, flat leaves reached over the path. They slapped against my jeans legs as 
I trotted along. 

Tall weeds grew over the path. After a minute or so, it became too dark to 
see. Had I wandered off the path? 



I clicked on the flashlight and shone the light along the ground. 

The light swept over the tall weeds, strange ferns, tendrils of vines. The 
black-trunked trees appeared to lean toward me, reaching for me with their 
smooth limbs. 

No path. 

Here I am, I thought, squinting into the pale beam of light. Here I am, all 
alone in the jungle. 

Now what do I do? 



15 


“Ow!” 

I swatted a mosquito on my neck. Too late. I could feel the throb of its bite. 

Rubbing my neck, I took a few steps through the tall weeds. I kept the 
circle of light in front of my feet. 

Aa-OO-tah. Aa-OO-tah. 

A shrill cry—very close by—made me stop. 

Night in the jungle belongs to the creatures, I remembered with a shiver. 

Aa-OO-tah. Aa-OO-tah. 

What was it? 

Not a giant rabbit. It sounded really BIG. 

I spun the light in a circle, keeping it low over the grass and vines. The 
smooth tree trunks shone purple in the pale light. 

I didn’t see any animals. 

I lowered the light. 

My whole body was shaking. Despite the damp heat of the night, I couldn’t 
stop shivering. 

A wind made the leaves all flap, the trees bend and whisper. 

The jungle was alive, I realized. 

Insects chittered all around. Fat leaves scraped and cracked. I heard the soft 
crackle of animal footsteps, running over the ground.. 

Aa-OO-tah. Aa-OO-tah. 

What was that? 

Without realizing it, I had pressed myself against a low tree. I took a deep 
breath and held it, listening hard. 

Was the animal moving closer? 

Thick clumps of leaves hung down from the low branches, forming a kind 
of cave. I’m protected under here, I thought, gazing all around. I suddenly felt a 
little safer, hidden under the thick leaves, under the low branches. 

Through my leafy roof, I glimpsed a sliver of white moonlight. It made the 
leaves gleam like silver. 

I clicked off the flashlight and lowered myself to a sitting position on the 



ground. Leaning back against the smooth trunk, I gazed up at the moon, taking 
slow, steady breaths. 

As soon as I felt calmer, I realized how tired I was. The sleepiness swept 
over me like a heavy blanket. I yawned loudly. My eyelids seemed to weigh a 
hundred pounds. 

I tried to stay alert. But I couldn’t fight the drowsiness. 

With the chittering of insects for a lullaby, I leaned my head against the tree 
trunk and drifted into a deep sleep. 

I dreamed about shrunken heads. 

Dozens of shrunken heads, the leathery skin purple and green, the black 
eyes glowing like dark coals, the dry black lips pulled back in angry snarls. 

The heads floated and danced through my dream. They darted back and 
forth like tennis balls. They flew into me, bounced against my chest, bounced off 
my head. But I didn’t feel them. 

They bounced and floated. And then the dry lips opened, and they all began 
to sing. “Hurry, Mark. Hurry. ” That was their song. 

The words came out hoarse and raspy. The sound of air rattling through 
dead leaves. 

“Hurry, Mark. Hurry. ” An ugly, frightening chant. 

“Hurry, Mark. Hurry. ” 

The black lips twisted into a sneer as they sang. The coal eyes glowed. The 
heads—dozens of shriveled, wrinkled heads—bobbed and bounced. 

I woke up with the whispered words in my ear. 

I blinked. Gray morning light shimmered down through the tree leaves. My 
back ached. My clothes felt damp. 

It took me a few seconds to remember where I was. 

The frightening dream stayed in my mind. My hand slid up to my T-shirt 
pocket. I felt the shrunken head tucked tightly inside. 

My face itched. 

I reached up to scratch my cheek—and pulled something off it. A leaf? 

No. 

I squinted at the insect in my hand. A large red ant. Nearly the size of a 
grasshopper. 

“Yuck!” I tossed it away. 

My skin tingled. My back itched. Something moved up and down my legs. 

I jerked myself up straight. Alert. Wide awake now. 



Itching like crazy. My whole body tingling. 

I stared down at myself. Stared down at my jeans and T-shirt. 
And started to scream. 



16 


I jumped to my feet. I thrashed my arms in the air. I kicked my legs. 

My body was covered with giant red ants. 

Hundreds and hundreds of them. Crawling over my arms, my legs, my 
chest. 

Their prickly legs scratched over my throat and the back of my neck. I 
pulled a fat one off my forehead. Then another off my cheek. 

I reached up and felt them crawling in my hair. 

“Ohhhh.” A low moan escaped my throat as I slapped at my hair. Swept my 
hands through it. Watched the big red ants fall to the ground. 

I felt them crawl over the backs of my hands. Hot and prickly. So big. And 
so many of them. 

I dropped to my knees, slapping at my chest, pulling the insects off my 
neck. I began rolling frantically in the tall grass, dripping wet from the heavy 
morning dew. 

I rolled and slapped at myself. Rolled over and over, trying to flatten the 
insects, trying to kick them off me. I grabbed another handful out of my hair and 
heaved them into a leafy bush. 

I struggled back to my feet, twisting and squirming. Pulling at the big red 

ants. 

But there were too many of them. My skin itched and tingled. Their tiny 
feet prickled my arms, my legs, my chest. 

It itched so badly, I felt I couldn’t breathe. 

I’m suffocating, I realized. The ants—they’re going to smother me! 

“Kah-lee-ah!” I screamed, squirming and slapping. “Kah-lee-ah!” 

To my surprise, ants started to drop off my body. 

“Kah-lee-ah!” I screamed again. 

Ants showered down to the ground. They leaped out of my hair, dropped 
off my forehead, off the front of my shirt. 

I stared in amazement as they fell to the ground. Then they scurried away, 
climbing over each other, stampeding over and under the tall grass. 

I rubbed my neck. I scratched my legs. My whole body still tingled. I still 
itched all over. 



But the big ants were gone. They had all jumped off when I shouted my 
special word. 

Special word. 

I glanced down over my shirt, trying to rub away the horrible tingling. 
Inside my pocket, the shrunken head’s eyes glowed. A bright yellow glow. 

“Whoa!” I grabbed the head and tugged it from the pocket. I held it up in 
front of me. 

“Kah-lee-ah!” I shouted. 

The eyes glowed brighter. 

My special word. 

Where did the word come from? I didn’t know. I thought I made it up. 

But I suddenly knew that the word was the secret behind the Jungle Magic. 

The word—and the shrunken head. 

Somehow the word brought the Jungle Magic to life. When I shouted it out, 
the ants jumped off me and hurried away. 

I gazed at the glowing little head with new excitement. My heart pounded 
in my chest. I concentrated on the head, thinking hard. 

I did have Jungle Magic. 

Dr. Hawlings and Carolyn were right. 

I had Jungle Magic and didn’t know it. And the word Kah-lee-ah was the 
key that unlocked it. 

It had helped me get rid of the gross red ants. Would it help lead me to Aunt 
Benna? 

“Yes!” I cried out loud. “Yes!” 

I knew that it would. I knew I could find her now. 

I was no longer afraid of the jungle and its creatures. No longer afraid of 
anything that might await me in this hot, tangled jungle. 

I had Jungle Magic. 

I had it—and I knew how to use it. 

And now, I had to find Aunt Benna. 

A red morning sun rose over the treetops. The air was already hot and 
damp. Birds chirped and twittered on the tree limbs above me. 

Holding the flashlight in one hand and the shrunken head in the other, I 
started to run toward the sun. 

I’m going east, I told myself. The sun comes up in the east. 

Was it the right direction to find my aunt? 



Yes. I was sure it was right. The Jungle Magic will lead me, I decided. I just 
need to follow it, and it will take me to Aunt Benna, wherever she is hiding on 
this island. 

I ran over fat, leafy vines and low shrubs. I ducked under smooth white tree 
branches. Broad leaves of huge green ferns slapped at me as I ran through them. 

The sun beamed down on my face as I made my way through a wide, sandy 
clearing. Sweat dripped down my forehead. 

“Hey—!” I cried out as my feet slipped on the soft sand. 

My feet slid. I lost my balance. My hands shot out. The flashlight and the 
shrunken head flew onto the sand. 

“Hey—!” 

I started to sink. 

Sand rolled up over my ankles. Up my legs. 

I kicked. I waved my arms wildly. 

I pulled up my knees. Tried to step out of the deep sand. But I was sinking, 
sinking faster now. Sand up to my waist. The more I struggled, the faster I sank. 
Deeper, deeper. Down into the pit of sand. 



17 


I couldn’t move my legs. I had sunk too deep in the hot, wet sand. 

The sand crept up over my waist. 

There’s no bottom, I thought. I’m going to keep sinking. I’m going to sink 
down, down until it covers my head. Until I disappear forever. 

My friends Eric and Joel once told me that there is no such thing as 
quicksand. I wished they were here right now. I could show them how wrong 
they were! 

I opened my mouth to shout for help. But I was too panicked to make a 
sound. Only a tiny squeak came out. 

What good is shouting? I asked myself. 

There’s no one around for miles. No one who will hear me. 

The sand felt thick and heavy as I slid down, down deeper into it. I 
stretched both hands up over my head, my hands grasping, as if trying to grab 
onto something. 

I tried moving my legs. Tried to pump them, like treading water or pedaling 
a bike. 

But the sand was too heavy. I was in too deep. 

My chest heaved with terror now. I gasped in breath after breath. 

I opened my mouth once again to call for help. 

And had an idea. 

“Kah-lee-ah!” I screamed, my voice high and frightened. 

“Kah-lee-ah! Kah-lee-ah!” 

Nothing happened. 



18 


“Kah-lee-ah! Kah-lee-ah!” 

I screeched the word at the top of my lungs. 

But I continued to sink deeper, deeper into the wet, marshy pit of sand. 

“Kah-lee-ah!” 

No. Nothing. 

I waved my arms over my head. And stared up at the pale blue sky. At the 
trees at the edge of the clearing. 

Nothing but trees as far as I could see. 

No one around. No one to help me. 

“Oh!” I suddenly realized why the magic word wasn’t working. I didn’t 
have the shrunken head. The head had flown from my hand when I fell into the 
sandpit. 

Where was it? Where? 

Did it sink into the sand? 

My eyes frantically searched the yellow-brown surface. The wet sand 
bubbled all around me, making a pock-pock-pock sound. Like a thick soup. 

I sank deeper. 

And saw the shrunken head. 

It lay on the surface. Its black eyes stared up at the sky. Its hair was tangled 
beneath it, spread over the sand. 

With an excited cry, I stretched out both hands and tried to grab it. 

No. Too far away. Just out of my reach. Inches out of my reach. 

“Unnnnh.” I uttered a low grunt as I struggled to grab it. Stretched out my 
hands. Stretched. Stretched. 

I leaned forward into the sand. Leaned and stretched. 

And grabbed for it. Grabbed for it, curling my fingers. Groaning and 
gmnting. Reaching. Reaching across the wet sand. 

But no. 

I couldn’t get it. The head lay a foot from my fingertips. 

A foot that seemed a mile. 

No way. No way. 



My fingers grabbed only air. I couldn’t reach it. 

I knew I was doomed. 

My hands dropped heavily onto the wet sand. I let out a defeated sigh. 



19 


My hands made a loud slapping sound as they hit the sand. 

And the head bounced. 

“Huh?” I uttered a startled cry. My heart started to pound. 

I slapped the surface of the wet sand again with both palms. 

The head bounced. Closer. 

Another hard slap. Another bounce. 

The head lay only a few inches away now. 

I grabbed it, held it tightly—and joyfully shouted out the word. “Kah-lee- 
ah! Kah-lee-ah! ” 

At first, nothing happened. 

My breath caught in my throat. I froze. 

“Kah-lee-ah! Kah-lee-ah! ” 

I expected to fly up. To be lifted out of the sandpit. To float magically over 
to hard ground. 

“Jungle Magic—please work! Please work!” I cried out loud. 

But I didn’t move. I sank a little deeper. The sand crept up over my chest. 

I stared at the shrunken head in my hand. The black eyes appeared to stare 
back at me. 

“Help me!” I cried. “Why aren’t you helping me?” 

And then I saw the vines. 

Yellow-green vines creeping over the sandpit. Moving like long snakes. A 
dozen twisting, crawling vines, slithering toward me from all directions. 

My heart pounded as I watched the vines slither closer. Closer. Until I 
reached out with my free hand and grabbed for the end of one. 

But the vine swept past my hand, moving quickly with surprising force. It 
wrapped itself around my chest—and started to tighten. 

“No!” I uttered a cry of protest. Was it going to strangle me? 

Another vine dipped into the sand. I felt it curl around my waist. 

“No—stop!” I wailed. 

The vines tightened around me. And then they began to pull. 

The wet sand made a thwock sound as I started to move through it. 



Holding the shrunken head in the air, I let the vines tug me through the 
sand. They pulled hard and fast. The sand flew at my sides. 

A few seconds later, the vines tugged me, on my knees, onto hard ground. I 
let out a happy cry. The vines instantly let go. I watched them pull back, curling 
quickly into the tall weeds. 

I hunched there, struggling to catch my breath, watching until the vines 
slithered out of sight. Then I pulled myself to my feet. 

My legs felt shaky and weak. My whole body trembled from my close call. 

But I didn’t care. I felt like jumping up and clapping and shouting for joy. 
The Jungle Magic had worked. The Jungle Magic had saved me once again! 

The wet sand clung to my jeans, my shirt, my arms—even my hair! I shook 
myself furiously. I tucked the shrunken head into my shirt pocket. Then I began 
slapping at my clothes, brushing off chunks of sand. 

Now what? I asked myself, glancing quickly around. The sun had risen high 
in the sky. The trees and ferns and tall grass gleamed, a shimmering blur of green 
and gold. The air had grown hot. My shirt clung wetly to my back. 

Now what? 

How do I find Aunt Benna? 

I pulled the shrunken head from my pocket and held it in front of me. “Lead 
the way,” I ordered it. 

Nothing happened. 

I brushed chunks of sand off its leathery skin. I pried sand from between its 
thin black lips. 

I turned toward the sun and took a few steps. Was I still walking east? 

To my surprise, the dark eyes on the shrunken head suddenly started to 
glow. 

What did that mean? Did that mean I was getting close to Aunt Benna? Did 
it mean I was walking in the right direction? 

I decided to test it. 

I spun around and started walking back toward the sandpit. 

The eyes on the head instantly dimmed back to black. 

I turned and started walking north. 

The eyes remained dark. 

I turned back in the direction of the sun. 

Yes! The eyes began, to glow again. “Kah-lee-ah!” I cried happily. The 
head was guiding me to my aunt. 



Animals howled and insects chittered loudly as I made my way through the 
trees and tall weeds. It all sounded like music to me now. 

“Aunt Benna, here I come!” I cheered. 

I found myself walking deeper into the jungle. I had to keep ducking my 
head to avoid low branches and thick vines that stretched from tree to tree. 

I heard weird bird calls overhead. As if the birds were talking to each other. 
As I ducked under a low limb, the whole tree seemed to shake. And a thousand 
black birds leaped off the branches, cawing angrily, so many of them they 
darkened the sky as they flapped away. 

I suddenly came to a small clearing that forked into two branches, one to 
the left, one to the right. Which way should I go? 

I held the shrunken head in front of me, watching it carefully. I started to 
the left. 

The eyes grew dark. Wrong way. 

I turned and started to the right, watching the eyes begin to glow again. 

Was Aunt Benna hiding somewhere in these trees? Was I getting close? 

The trees ended suddenly again, and I found myself in a grassy clearing. I 
squinted in the bright sunlight, my eyes sweeping over the shimmering green 
grass. 

Alow growl made me spin back toward the trees. 

“Oh—!” I let out a sharp cry as I saw the tiger. My legs nearly crumpled 
under me. 

The tiger raised its head in another growl. An angry growl. It pulled back its 
lips, baring enormous teeth. It arched its back, its yellow-brown fur standing 
straight on end. 

Then with a furious hiss, it came charging at me. 



20 


The tiger’s huge paws pounded over the grass. Its yellow eyes burned into mine. 

I glimpsed two little cubs behind it, nestled in the shade of a tree. 

“I’m not going to hurt your cubs!” I wanted to cry. 

But of course there was no time. 

The tiger let out a furious roar as it charged. 

The roar drowned out my cry as I raised the shrunken head in front of me in 
a trembling hand. “Kah-lee-ah!” 

My voice came out in a whimper. 

I nearly dropped the head. My knees collapsed. I sank to the grass. 

The tiger closed in for the kill. Its heavy paws thudded the dirt as it leaped 
toward me. 

The ground felt as if it were shaking. 

The ground was shaking! 

To my horror, I heard a deafening ripping sound. Like Velcro being torn 
apart. Only a thousand times louder. 

I let out a cry as the ground trembled. Shook. 

Split apart. 

The grass tore away. The dirt split in two. 

The earth opened up. 

And I started to fall. Down into an endless hole in the earth. 

Down, down. 

Screaming all the way. 



21 


“Owww!” 

I landed hard on my elbows and knees. Pain shot through my body. I 
actually saw stars! Hundreds of them, all red and yellow. 

Trying to blink them away, I raised myself to my knees. 

The shrunken head had bounced out of my hand. I spotted it a few feet 
away in the dirt. I dove for it, grabbed it up in my shaking hand, and held onto it 
tightly. 

I felt dizzy and shaken. I closed my eyes and waited for the dizziness to 

pass. 

When I opened them, I realized I had fallen into a deep pit. Walls of dirt 
surrounded me. The blue sky was a small square high above my head. 

Jungle Magic had saved me once again. The magic had caused the ground 
to split open so that I could fall to safety. So that I could escape the tiger. 

I heard a low growl above me. 

With a frightened cry, I gazed up to the top of the pit. And saw two yellow 
eyes glaring down at me. 

The tiger snarled, baring its teeth. 

I didn’t escape, I realized. 

I’m trapped down here. If the tiger leaps down into the pit, it will finish me 
off in seconds. 

I have nowhere to run. No way to escape. 

I fell back against the wall of dirt. I stared up at the snarling tiger. It eyed 
me hungrily, roaring again. Preparing to leap to the attack. 

“Kah-lee-ah!” I cried. “Kah-lee-ah!” 

The tiger roared in reply. 

I pressed my back against the dirt. Tried to stop my whole body from 
shaking. 

Please don’t come down here! I begged silently. Please don’t jump down 
into this pit! 

The yellow eyes glowed in the sunlight. The silvery whiskers twitched as 
the tiger snarled its toothy warning. 

And then I saw a little yellow-and-black cat face appear at the top of the pit. 



One of the tiger cubs. It peered down at me over the edge of the grass. 

The other cub popped up beside it. It leaned over the pit edge. Leaned so 
far, it nearly fell in! 

The tiger moved quickly. She lowered her head—and bumped the cub away 
from the edge. Then she picked up the other cub in her teeth and carried it away. 

I swallowed hard. I didn’t move. My back pressed against the cool dirt, I 
stared up to the top. Watched the square of blue sky. And waited for the tiger to 
return. 

Waited. 

And waited. Holding my breath. 

Silence now. So silent I could hear the wind rushing through the tall grass. 

A chunk of dirt broke off the pit wall and toppled to the bottom, crumbling 
as it landed. I kept my gaze on the opening, listening hard, watching for the tiger. 

After what seemed like hours, I let out a long whoosh of air. I stepped away 
from the dirt wall and stretched. 

The tiger isn’t coming back, I decided. 

She only wanted to protect her cubs from me. By now, she has taken them 
away. Far away. 

I stretched again. My heart was still thumping hard in my chest. But I was 
starting to feel a little more normal. 

How do I get out of here? I wondered, gazing at the steep dirt walls. Can I 
climb out? 

I tucked the shrunken head back into my pocket. Then I dug both hands into 
the soft, cool dirt and tried to climb. 

I pulled myself up about a foot or two. But then the dirt broke off under my 
sneakers. It crumbled and fell, sending me sliding back to the bottom. 

No. No way. I can’t climb out, I realized. 

I reached for the shrunken head. I’ll have to use Jungle Magic, I decided. 

The magic got me down here. Now I can use it to get me out. 

I raised the head in front of me. But before I could call out the word, 
darkness fell over the pit. 

Is the sun setting already? I wondered. 

I gazed up to the top. 

No. It wasn’t evening. The square of sky that I could see was still bright 

blue. 

Someone stood up there, blocking the sunlight. 



The tiger? 

A human? 

I squinted hard, struggling to see. 
“Who-who’s there?” I called. 



22 


A face leaned over the edge, peering down at me. Squinting into the bright 
sunlight, I saw straight blond hair. Pale blue eyes. 

“Kareen!” I shouted. 

She cupped her hands around her mouth. “Mark—what are you doing down 
there?” 

“What are you doing here?” I cried. 

Her hair fell over her face. She brushed it back. “I—I followed you. I was 
so worried about you!” 

“Get me out of here!” I shouted up to her. I tried climbing again. But the 
dirt slid out from under my sneakers. 

“How?” she called down. 

“I guess you didn’t bring a ladder with you?” I shouted. 

“Uh—no, Mark,” Kareen sniped. 

I guess she doesn’t have much of a sense of humor. 

“Maybe I could drop a rope down or something,” she suggested. 

“Rope isn’t too easy to find in the middle of the jungle,” I reminded her. 

She shook her head. Her face tightened into a fretful frown. 

“How about a vine?” I called up. “See if you can find a long vine. I could 
climb up a vine.” 

Her expression brightened. She disappeared. I waited impatiently. And 
waited. “Please hurry,” I murmured out loud, my eyes on the square opening at 
the top. “Please hurry.” 

I heard the squawk of birds somewhere up above. Fluttering wings. More 
squawking and cawing. 

Are the birds frightened? I wondered. If they are, why? Has the tiger 
returned? 

I pressed against the dirt wall, watching the sky. 

Finally, Kareen reappeared. “I found a vine. But I don’t know if it’s long 
enough.” 

“Lower it over the side,” I instructed her. “Quick. I have to get out of here. I 
feel like a trapped animal.” 



“It was hard to pull it out of the ground,” she complained. She began 
lowering the vine. It looked like a long snake twining down the side of the pit. 

It stopped a few feet above my head. “I’m going to jump up and grab it,” I 
told Kareen. “Then I’ll try to climb while you pull. Wrap the other end around 
your waist, okay? Just don’t let go of it!” 

“Just don’t pull me down with you!” she called back. 

I waited for her to tie the vine around herself. Then I bent my knees and 
jumped. I missed the end of the vine by a few inches. 

This was one of those times I wished I were tall and thin instead of short 
and chubby. 

But I grabbed the vine on my third try. I wrapped both hands around it. 

Then I pressed the soles of my sneakers against the dirt wall. And started to 
pull myself up, like a mountain climber. 

The dirt kept crumbling out from under me. And the vine grew more and 
more slippery as my hands started to sweat. But with Kareen cheering me on, I 
scrambled to the top. 

I lay in the tall grass for a moment, breathing in the sweet fragrance. It felt 
so wonderful to be out of that deep hole. 

“How did you fall down there anyway?” Kareen asked, tossing her end of 
the vine to the ground. 

“It was easy,” I replied. I climbed to my feet and tried to brush the dirt off 
my clothes. 

“But didn’t you see that big pit there?” she demanded. 

“Not exactly,” I told her. I wanted to change the subject. “How did you find 
me? What are you doing here, Kareen?” 

Her blue eyes locked on mine. “I was worried about you. I—I didn’t think 
you should be all alone in the jungle. So I sneaked away. Daddy was working in 
his lab. I crept away from the headquarters, and I followed you.” 

I brushed clumps of dirt from my hair. “Well, I’m glad,” I confessed. “But 
aren’t you going to be in major trouble with your dad and Carolyn?” 

She bit her lower lip. “Probably. But it will be worth the risk—if we find 
your aunt.” 

Aunt Benna! 

Trying to survive the quicksand and the tiger, I had nearly forgotten about 
her. 

A shadow rolled over us. The air suddenly grew cooler. I glanced up at the 



sky. The sun was lowering itself behind the trees. 

“It’s almost night,” I said quietly. “I—I hope we can find Aunt Benna 
before it gets really dark.” 

I had already spent one night out in the jungle. I didn’t want to spend 
another. 

“Do you know which way to go?” Kareen asked. “Are you just wandering 
around, hoping to get lucky?” 

“No way,” I replied. I pulled the head from my shirt pocket. “This little guy 
is showing me the way.” 

“Excuse me?” Kareen’s face filled with surprise. 

“The eyes light up when I go the right direction,” I explained. “At least, I 
think that’s why they light up.” 

Kareen gasped. “You mean, you really do have Jungle Magic?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. I have it. It’s so weird. There’s a word I’ve always said. 
‘Kah-lee-ah.’ Just a crazy word. I thought I made it up when I was a little kid. 
But it’s the word that makes the Jungle Magic work.” 

“Wow!” Kareen exclaimed. A grin spread across her face. “That’s awesome, 
Mark! That means we really will find Benna. That’s so great!” 

The shadows over the ground grew longer as the sun dipped lower. I 
shivered as a cold gust of wind blew over us. 

My stomach growled. I couldn’t remember when my last meal was. I tried 
not to think about food. I had to keep moving. 

“Let’s get going,” I said softly. I raised the head in front of me. Then I 
turned slowly—one direction, then the next—until the eyes began to glow. “This 
way!” I cried, pointing across the clearing to the trees. 

We started walking side by side. The tall grass swished, brushing our legs 
as we stepped through it. Insects chittered in the trees. 

Kareen stared in amazement at the glowing eyes on the leathery head. “Do 
you really think it’s guiding us to Benna?” 

“We’ll soon find out,” I said solemnly. 

We stepped into the shifting darkness beneath the tangled trees. 



23 


As the sunlight faded, the jungle sounds changed. The birds in the trees stopped 
chirping. The shrill sawing of the insects grew louder. We heard strange animal 
howls and cries in the distance, the sound bouncing between the smooth trees. 

I hoped the howls and cries stayed in the distance! 

Dark creatures slithered through the tall weeds and low, fat ferns and 
shrubs. The shrubs appeared to tremble as night creatures scurried through them. 

I heard the warning hiss of snakes. The eerie hoot of an owl. The soft flap 
of bat wings. 

I moved closer to Kareen as we walked. The sounds were all so much more 
realistic than in my Jungle King game! 

I’ll probably never play that game again after this, I thought. It will seem 
way too tame. 

We pushed our way through a clump of tall, stiff reeds. The eyes on the 
shrunken head dimmed to black. 

“Wrong way!” I whispered. 

Kareen and I turned until the eyes glowed again. Then we moved forward, 
making our own path. We stepped over thick vines and pushed through tangles 
of weeds and low shrubs. 

“Ow!” Kareen slapped at her forehead. “Stupid mosquito.” 

The shrill scratching of insects grew louder, drowning out the crunch of our 
sneakers over the leaves and vines on the jungle floor. 

As the darkness deepened, the eyes on the shrunken head appeared to glow 
brighter. Like twin flashlights, guiding us through the trees. 

“I’m getting kind of tired,” Kareen complained. She ducked her head to 
avoid a low branch. “I hope your aunt is nearby. I don’t know how much longer I 
can walk.” 

“I hope she’s nearby, too,” I murmured in reply. I’d had a pretty exhausting 
day myself! 

As we walked, I couldn’t help thinking about Aunt Benna and her 
notebook. I didn’t want to make Kareen feel bad. But I had to say something. 

“My aunt didn’t write very nice things about your dad and Carolyn in her 
notebook,” I said, keeping my eyes at my feet. “I was kind of surprised.” 



Kareen was silent for a long moment. “That’s so horrible,” she said finally. 
“They worked together for so long. I knew they had an argument.” 

“About what?” I asked. 

Kareen let out a sigh. “Daddy has some plans to develop the jungle. He 
thinks there are valuable minerals here. Benna thinks the jungle should be 
preserved.” 

She sighed again. “I think that’s what they fought about. I’m not sure.” 

“The notebook made it seem like your dad is evil or something,” I 
muttered, avoiding her eyes. 

“Evil? Daddy?” she cried. “No. No way. He’s very strong-minded. That’s 
all. He isn’t evil. And I know that Daddy still cares about Benna. He still 
respects her and cares about her. He’s really worried about her. He—” 

“Whoa.” I grabbed Kareen’s arm, interrupting her. “Look.” I pointed 
through the trees. 

I spotted a clearing up ahead. And against the gray sky, I could see the 
black outline of a small shack. 

Kareen gasped. “That little house. Do you think—?” 

We both crept to the edge of the clearing. Something scurried quickly over 
my sneakers, but I ignored it. 

My eyes were on the tiny, dark shack. 

As we moved closer, I could see that it was built of tree limbs and sticks. 
Clumps of fat leaves made the roof. It had no window. But there were narrow 
openings between the branches. 

“Hey—!” I whispered. I saw a pale light flicker in one of the openings. 

A flashlight? A candle? 

“Someone is in there,” Kareen whispered, narrowing her eyes at the shack. 

I heard a cough. 

A woman’s cough? Aunt Benna’s cough? I couldn’t tell. 

“Do you think it’s my aunt?” I whispered, huddling close to Kareen. 

“Only one way to find out,” she whispered back. 

The shrunken head glowed brightly in my hand. The eerie yellow-green 
light splashed over the ground as Kareen and I crept closer. 

Closer. 

“Aunt Benna?” I called in a tiny voice. I cleared my throat. My heart 
pounded. “Aunt Benna? Is that you?” 



24 


I called again and stepped close to the open doorway of the small shack. I heard 
a thump inside. Saw a flash of light. And heard a startled cry. 

A lantern appeared in the doorway. My eyes went to the pale yellow light. 
And then moved up to see the woman holding the lantern. 

She was short—very short. Only about a foot taller than me, and a little 
chubby. Her straight black hair was tied back. In the glow of lantern light, I saw 
that she wore khaki slacks and a khaki safari jacket. 

“Who’s there?” She raised the lantern in front of her. 

“Aunt Benna?” I cried, moving closer. “Is that you?” 

“Mark? I don’t believe it!” she exclaimed. She came running toward me, 
the lantern swinging at her side. The light bounced over the tall grass, making 
shadows dance. 

She wrapped me in a hug. “Mark—how did you find me? What are you 
doing here?” She had a high, chirpy voice, and she talked rapidly, without taking 
a breath. 

She pushed me away from her to study my face. “I don’t believe I even 
recognized you. I haven’t seen you since you were four!” 

“Aunt Benna—what are you doing out here?” I demanded breathlessly. 
“Everyone is so worried—” 

“How did you get to Baladora?” she asked, gripping my shoulder with her 
free hand, holding the lantern high with the other. “What are you doing in the 
jungle? How did you get here?” she cried again. 

“I—I used the Jungle Magic,” I stammered. 

Her eyes went wide. With surprise? With fear? 

I suddenly realized she wasn’t looking at me. “Hello. Who are you?” Aunt 
Benna asked quietly, stretching the lantern toward the trees. 

Kareen stepped out from the edge of the clearing. In all the excitement, I 
didn’t realize that she had lingered behind. 

“That’s Kareen,” I told my aunt. “Do you know Kareen? Dr. Hawlings’ 
daughter?” 

Aunt Benna gasped. She squeezed my shoulder. “Why did you bring her 
here? Don’t you realize—?” 



“It’s okay,” Kareen said quickly. “I was worried about you. That’s why I 
followed Mark.” 

“She helped me,” I explained to Aunt Benna. “Kareen helped me get away 
from them. From Dr. Hawlings and Carolyn. Kareen helped me get through the 
jungle.” 

“But—but—” Aunt Benna sputtered. “You told her about the Jungle 
Magic?” 

“I only came to help!” Kareen insisted. “My father is worried about you. He 

“Your father wants to kill me!” Aunt Benna cried angrily. “That’s why I had 
to mn away. That’s why I had to leave everything behind and hide in the jungle.” 
She glared at Kareen, her eyes squinting, her face pinched and hard in the yellow 
lantern light. 

“Kareen is okay,” I assured her. “She only wants to help, Aunt Benna. 
Really.” 

My aunt turned to me. “Carolyn and Hawlings brought you here?” 

I nodded. “Yes. To find you. Carolyn brought me this.” I pulled the 
shrunken head from my shirt pocket. It had stopped glowing. 

“They told me I had Jungle Magic,” I continued. “I didn’t know what they 
meant. I thought they were crazy. Then, when I went out to look for you in the 
jungle, I discovered that I did have it.” 

Aunt Benna nodded. “Yes. You have it, Mark. I gave it to you when I 
visited you. When you were four. I hypnotized you. And I transferred the Jungle 
Magic from me to you. To keep it safe.” 

“Yes. I read your notebook,” I told her. “I read about why you gave me the 
magic. But it didn’t say what Jungle Magic is. I only know—” 

“It’s a powerful force,” my aunt replied, lowering her voice. “It’s a 
powerful force that will do your will, carry out your wishes.” 

Her eyes filled with sadness. “But we cannot talk about it now,” she said in 
a whisper. “We are in danger here, Mark. Real danger.” 

I started to reply. But I heard rustling, cracking sounds from the trees. 
Footsteps? 

All three of us spun around toward the sound. 

To my surprise, Kareen started running across the grass. She cupped her 
hands around her mouth. “Over here, Daddy!” she shouted. “Over here! I found 
Benna, Daddy! Hurry!” 



25 


I gasped in shock. 

No time to run. 

A beam of light flickered out from the trees. Behind it came Dr. Hawlings, 
trotting over the tall grass. He carried a flashlight in one hand. The light swept 
into my eyes, then moved over Aunt Benna. 

Was Dr. Hawlings carrying a gun? Some kind of weapon? I couldn’t see. 
And I didn’t want to find out. 

I grabbed Aunt Benna’s arm and tugged. I wanted to run, to escape into the 
jungle. 

But my aunt refused to move. She seemed frozen in surprise. Or fear. 

Kareen’s father trotted up to us, breathing hard. Even in the dim light, I 
could see the pleased smile on his face. 

“Good work, Kareen.” He patted her shoulder. “I knew that if you helped 
Mark escape, he would lead us right to his aunt.” 

Still holding onto Aunt Benna’s arm, I stared at Kareen angrily. She had 
tricked me. She had pretended to be my friend. But the whole time, she was 
working to help her father. 

Kareen stared back at me for a moment. Then she lowered her eyes to the 
ground. 

“Why did you trick me?” I demanded. “Why did you do it, Kareen?” 

She raised her eyes to me. “Daddy needs the Jungle Magic,” she replied 
softly. 

“But you lied to me!” I cried. 

“I didn’t have a choice,” Kareen said. “If your father needed your help, 
what would you do?” 

“You did the right thing, Kareen,” Dr. Hawlings told her. 

He raised the light to Aunt Benna’s face. He forced her to cover her eyes. 
“Did you really think you could hide forever, Benna?” he demanded softly. 

“I—I’m sorry,” I told my aunt. “It’s my fault. I—” 

“No.” Aunt Benna put a hand on my shoulder. “It’s not your fault, Mark. 
It’s my fault. You didn’t know anything about any of this. And now I’m afraid 
I’ve gotten you into a lot of trouble.” 



Dr. Hawlings snickered. “A lot of trouble. That’s the truth.” He stepped up 
to Aunt Benna. “I want the secret of Jungle Magic. Tell me the secret, Benna. 
Let me know how it works. And I will allow you and your nephew to leave the 
island in one piece.” 

In one piece? 

I didn’t like the sound of that. 

As Dr. Hawlings stared at my aunt, I slipped the shrunken head from my 
pocket. I’ll use the Jungle Magic, I decided. I’ll use the magic to get us out of 
this jam. 

I raised the head slowly in front of me. I opened my mouth to call out the 
secret word. 

But I was stopped when I caught Aunt Benna’s glance. 

She was signaling me with her eyes. Telling me not to do it. 

“What’s going on?” Dr. Hawlings demanded, angrily turning to me. “What 
are you doing?” 

“Don’t give it away, Mark,” Aunt Benna pleaded. “Don’t let them know the 
secret word.” 

I lowered the shrunken head. “I won’t,” I whispered. 

“It’s okay, Daddy,” Kareen said, her eyes on me. “I know the word. Mark 
told it to me. I can tell you what it is. It’s—” 



26 


I clamped my hand over Kareen’s mouth. “Run!” I cried to Aunt Benna. “Run— 
now!” 

With an angry cry of attack, Aunt Benna lowered her shoulder and barreled 
into Dr. Hawlings. She roared into him like a football player—and sent him 
sprawling against the little shack. 

He uttered a startled yelp. The flashlight flew out of his hand and rolled 
across the ground. 

I spun away from Kareen and followed my aunt. Our shoes thudded over 
the tall grass as we ran for the trees. 

We were nearly to the edge of the clearing when Carolyn stepped in front of 
us. “What’s your hurry?” she demanded, moving to block our way. “The party is 
just starting.” 

Aunt Benna and I whirled around. Dr. Hawlings had moved up behind us. 
We were trapped. 

Carolyn raised her flashlight. Her silvery eyes narrowed at Aunt Benna. 
Carolyn smiled. A cold, unpleasant smile. “How are you, Benna? We missed 
you.” 

“Enough chitchat,” Dr. Hawlings muttered, gesturing with his flashlight. 
“It’s too dark to go back to the headquarters. We’ll have to spend the night here.” 

“How cozy,” Carolyn said, still smiling that cold smile at Aunt Benna. 

Aunt Benna scowled and looked away. “Carolyn, I thought you were my 
friend.” 

“We’re all good friends here,” Dr. Hawlings said. “And good friends like to 
share. That’s why you’re going to share the secret of Jungle Magic with us, 
Benna.” 

“Never!” my aunt declared, crossing her arms in front of her. 

“Never isn’t a word for friends,” Dr. Hawlings scolded. “In the morning, 
we will go back to the headquarters. Then you will share everything, Benna. You 
will share all of your secrets. And you will give the Jungle Magic to Carolyn and 
me.” 

“Like a good friend,” Carolyn added. 

“Let’s go,” Dr. Hawlings said. He put a heavy hand on my back and shoved 



me toward the little shack. Kareen was sitting on the ground, her collar pulled 
up, her back leaning against one wall. 

“You and Benna—in the shack,” Dr. Hawlings ordered, giving me another 
rough shove. “That way, we can keep an eye on you.” 

“You’re wasting your time, Richard,” Aunt Benna told him. She was trying 
to sound tough, but her voice trembled as she said it. 

Dr. Hawlings forced us into the dark shack. Aunt Benna and I stretched out 
on the floor. Through the cracks in the wall, I could see the darting light of their 
flashlights. 

“Are they going to guard us all night?” I whispered. 

Aunt Benna nodded. “We’re their prisoners now,” she whispered back. She 
sighed. “But we can’t let them have the Jungle Magic. We can’t!” 

I slid closer to my aunt. “If we don’t give it to them,” I said softly, “what 
will they do to us?” 

Aunt Benna didn’t reply. 

“What will they do to us?” I repeated. 

She stared down at the floor and didn’t answer. 



27 


A red ball of a sun was rising in the early morning sky when Dr. Hawlings poked 
his head into the shack and woke us up. 

I had slept only a few minutes. The shack had no floor, and the ground was 

hard. 

Whenever I closed my eyes, I dreamed about the shrunken head in my 
pocket. I dreamed that I held it in my hand. It blinked its eyes and its lips began 
to move. 

“You are doomed /” it exclaimed in a horrifying, hoarse whisper. “You are 
doomed. Doomed. Doomed! ” 

Aunt Benna and I scrambled out of the shack, stretching and yawning. Even 
though the sun was still low over the trees, the air already felt hot and wet. 

My whole body ached from lying on the hard ground. My shirt was damp 
and smelly. My stomach growled. I scratched my neck and discovered it was 
covered with mosquito bites. 

Not one of the great mornings. 

And it wasn’t going to get any better. 

We walked for hours through the sweltering jungle. Carolyn and Kareen led 
the way. Dr. Hawlings walked behind Aunt Benna and me, making sure we 
didn’t try to escape. 

No one said a word. The only sounds were the cries of animals, the chirping 
of birds overhead, and the swish of the tall weeds and grass as we pushed 
through. 

Swarms of white gnats flew up off the path, swirling together like small 
tornadoes. The sun beamed down through the trees, burning the back of my 
neck. 

When we finally made it back to the row of cabins, I was hot, sweaty, 
starving, and dying of thirst. 

Dr. Hawlings shoved Aunt Benna and me into an empty cabin. He slammed 
the door behind us and locked it. 

The cabin had two folding chairs and a small bed without sheets or 
blankets. I dropped down wearily onto the bare mattress. “What is he going to do 
to us?” 



Aunt Benna bit her lip. “Don’t worry,” she said softly. “I’ll figure 
something out.” She crossed the small room and tried the window. It was either 
stuck or bolted from the outside. 

“Maybe we can break the glass,” I suggested. 

“No, he’ll hear it,” Aunt Benna replied. 

I rubbed the back of my neck. The mosquito bites were itching like crazy. I 
wiped sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand. 

The door opened. Kareen entered, carrying two small bottles of water. She 
tossed one to me and one to my aunt. Then she turned quickly, closed the door 
hard behind her, and carefully locked it. 

I tilted the bottle to my mouth and gulped down the water without taking a 
breath. There were a few drops left at the bottom. I sprinkled them over the top 
of my head. Then I tossed the bottle to the floor. 

“What are we going to do?” I asked Aunt Benna. 

She was sitting in one of the folding chairs, her feet resting on the other. 
She raised a finger to her lips. “Ssshhh.” 

Outside, I heard the rattle of machinery. A metallic clang. I heard the rush 
of water from a hose. 

I hurried to the window and peered out. But it faced the wrong way. I 
couldn’t see anything. 

“We’ve had one lucky break,” Aunt Benna murmured. 

I stared at her. “Excuse me?” 

“One lucky break,” she repeated. “Hawlings didn’t take away the shrunken 
head. It was so dark last night, I don’t think he saw it.” 

I pulled the head out from my pocket. The black hair had become tangled. I 
started to smooth it back. 

“Put it away, Mark,” Aunt Benna ordered sharply. “We don’t want 
Hawlings to see it. He doesn’t know that the head is needed for Jungle Magic.” 

“This particular head?” I asked, shoving it back in the pocket. “Only this 
head?” 

Aunt Benna nodded. “Yes. That head and the magic word. The word I gave 
you when I hypnotized you. When you were four.” 

The head’s black hair fell over my pocket. I carefully tucked it inside. 

Outside, I heard another metallic clank. I heard a splash. The roar of water 
grew louder. 

“We are in terrible danger,” Aunt Benna said softly. “You will have to use 



the Jungle Magic to save us, Mark.” 

I felt a chill of fear. But I muttered, “No problem.” 

“Wait till I give you the signal,” Aunt Benna instructed. “When I blink my 
eyes three times, pull the shrunken head out and shout the word. Keep watching 
me. Watch for the signal—okay?” 

Before I could reply, the door burst open. Dr. Hawlings and Carolyn hurried 
in, their faces grim. 

Dr. Hawlings carried a large silvery pistol. “Outside,” he ordered, waving 
the pistol at Aunt Benna and me. 

Carolyn led the way down the row of cabins. She turned and made us stop 
behind the main headquarters building. Kareen stood against the wall, a wide- 
brimmed straw hat pulled down over her eyes. 

The sun beamed down. The back of my neck prickled and itched. 

Huddling close to my aunt, I squinted into the bright sunlight. To my right, 
the big pile of shrunken heads came into focus. 

The dark eyes on the leathery, purple-and-brown heads seemed to stare at 
me. The mouths were all twisted in ugly expressions of anger and horror. 

I turned away from the terrifying pile of tiny heads—to see something even 
more terrifying. 

An enormous black pot stood behind the headquarters building. Water 
brimmed over the top, bubbling and boiling. 

The pot stood on some kind of electric burner. Like a stove burner. It glared 
red hot. The boiling water inside the pot bubbled and steamed. 

I turned to Aunt Benna and caught the fear on her face. “You can’t do this!” 
she screamed to Dr. Hawlings. “You know you can’t get away with this!” 

“I don’t want to hurt you,” Dr. Hawlings said calmly, without any emotion 
at all. A smile spread over his face. “I don’t want to harm you, Benna. I just want 
to own the Jungle Magic.” 

I kept my eyes locked on my aunt. Waiting for her signal. Waiting for the 
three blinks that meant I should go into action. 

“Give me the Jungle Magic,” Dr. Hawlings insisted. 

Carolyn stepped up beside him, hands on her waist. “Give it to us, Benna. 
We don’t want trouble. We really don’t.” 

“No!” The word shot out of my aunt’s mouth. “No! No! No! You both 
know that I will never give up the secret of Jungle Magic. Not to you. Not ever!” 

Carolyn sighed. “Please, Benna. Don’t make it difficult.” 



My aunt stared back at her. “Never,” she murmured. 

Aunt Benna blinked. 

I swallowed hard, watching for two more blinks. 

No. Not the signal. Not yet. 

Dr. Hawlings stepped forward. “Please, Benna. I’m giving you one last 
chance. Tell us the secret—now.” 

Aunt Benna shook her head. 

“Then I have no choice,” Dr. Hawlings said, shaking his head. “Since you 
two are the only ones in the world who know the secret, you are both too 
dangerous. The secret must die with you.” 

“Wh-what are you going to do to us?” I blurted out. 

“We’re going to shrink your heads,” Dr. Hawlings replied. 



28 


The pot hissed as water boiled over the side. I stared in horror at the billows of 
steam rising up over the pot. 

Was he really going to shrink our heads? 

Was I going to end up shriveled and leathery, with a head the size of a 
doorknob? 

I forced my legs to stop wobbling and stared at Aunt Benna. Stared at her. 
Stared hard. Watching her eyes. Waiting for the three blinks. 

Hurry! I pleaded silently. Hurry—before he tosses us into the boiling water! 

Kareen watched in silence. What was she thinking? I wondered. I couldn’t 
see her expression. Her face was hidden under the brim of the straw hat. 

“Benna, one last chance,” Dr. Hawlings said softly. “Because I like you. 
And I like your nephew. Don’t let me harm your nephew, Benna. Do it for him, 
okay? Tell me the secret—for Mark’s sake.” 

“It isn’t worth it, Benna,” Carolyn chimed in. “It will be so easy for you to 
give the Jungle Magic to us.” 

“I-I can’t,” Aunt Benna stammered. 

“Then we have no choice,” Dr. Hawlings said, almost sadly. “The boy goes 
in first.” 

He took a step toward me. 

Aunt Benna blinked. Once. Twice. Three times. 

Finally! 

With a trembling hand, I tugged the head from my pocket. 

I raised it in front of me. I opened my mouth to shout the secret word. 

But Dr. Hawlings swiped the head from my hand. 

He grabbed it away—and tossed it onto the big pile of heads. 

Then he dove for me, reaching out to grab me with both hands. 

I ducked out from under him. 

And threw myself onto the disgusting pile of heads. 

I began frantically sorting through them with both hands. Picking one up, 
tossing it aside. Grabbing the next one. The next one. The next one. 

They felt sticky and warm. Hard as baseballs. The hair brushed my hands. 



The dark eyes stared up at me blankly. They were so ugly, my stomach 
tightened. My breath came in wheezing gasps. 

Behind me, I could hear my aunt struggling with Dr. Hawlings. Wrestling 
with him. Trying to keep him away from me. 

I heard Carolyn’s shouts. Kareen’s cries of alarm. 

I had to find my shrunken head. 

I had to find it before Dr. Hawlings broke free of my aunt and grabbed me. 

I picked one up. Tossed it down. Picked up another. Tossed it down. 

How could I find mine? 

Which one was it? 

Which one? Which one? 



29 


I grabbed a head. Saw ants crawling over its cheeks. 

Picked up another. 

It stared at me with glassy green eyes. 

Picked up another. 

It had a long white scratch on its ear. 

I started to toss it back onto the pile. 

But stopped. 

A white scratch on its ear? 

Yes! Mine had a scratch! My sister Jessica—she scratched it back home! 

Yes! This head was mine! 

“Thank you, Jessica!” I cried at the top of my lungs. 

With an angry cry, Dr. Hawlings dove at me. He wrapped his arms around 
me and started to drag me off the pile of heads. 

“Kah-lee-ah!” I shouted, holding on tightly to the shrunken head. My 
shrunken head. “Kah-lee-ah!” 

Will it save Aunt Benna and me? I wondered. 

Will the Jungle Magic work this time? 

Dr. Hawlings still had his arms around my shoulders. He was still trying to 
pull me toward the boiling pot. 

“Kah-lee-ah!” I screamed. 

His hands slid away. 

They seemed to shrink. His arms seemed to shrink into his body. 

“Huh?” I uttered a startled cry when I realized that he was shrinking. Dr. 
Hawlings’ entire body was shrinking, growing smaller and smaller! 

I raised my eyes to Kareen and Carolyn. They were shrinking, too. 
Shrinking down to the ground. 

Kareen disappeared under the straw hat. Then she came running out from 
under the brim. A tiny Kareen, about the size of a mouse. 

All three of them—Kareen, Carolyn, and Dr. Hawlings—scampered over 
the grass. Mouse-sized. Squeaking angrily in tiny mouse voices. 

I stood beside the pile of heads and watched them scurry over the ground. 



Squeaking and squealing. I watched them until they disappeared into the jungle. 

Then I turned back to Aunt Benna. “It worked!” I cried. “The Jungle Magic 
—it saved us!” 

She rushed forward and wrapped me in a hug. “You did it, Mark. You did 
it! The jungle is safe now! The whole world is safe!” 


* * * 


There were more hugs when Aunt Benna flew me home. Hugs from Mom—and 
even Jessica. 

They met us at the airport. Then Mom drove us home for a big welcome- 
home dinner. I had so many stories to tell, I started telling them in the car. And I 
didn’t stop talking until way past dinner. 

It was nearly bedtime when Aunt Benna led me into the den. She closed the 
door behind us. Then she sat me down on the couch. 

She sat down beside me. “Look into my eyes,” she said softly. “Look 
deeply, Mark. Very deeply.” 

I raised my eyes to hers. “What are you going to do?” I asked. 

I didn’t hear her reply. 

As I stared into her eyes, the room grew fuzzy. The colors all seemed to 
shift and blur. I thought I saw the posters on the den wall flipping over and over. 
I thought I saw the chairs and coffee table sliding across the floor. 

After a while, the room came back into focus. Aunt Benna smiled at me. 
“There,” she said, squeezing my hand. “You’re back to normal, Mark.” 

“Huh?” I squinted at her. “What do you mean?” 

“No more Jungle Magic,” she explained. “I took it back. You’re a normal 
boy again.” 

“You mean, if I shout ‘Kah-lee-ah’ nothing will happen?” I asked. 

“That’s right.” She smiled at me, still holding my hand. “I took back the 
magic. The shrunken head has no powers. And you have no powers. You never 
have to worry about it again.” 

She stood up, yawning. “It’s getting late. Bedtime, don’t you think?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. I guess.” I was still thinking about how I didn’t have 
Jungle Magic anymore. “Aunt Benna?” 

“Yes?” 


“Can I keep the shrunken head?” 



“Of course,” she replied, tugging me to my feet. “Keep the shrunken head. 
As a souvenir. That way, you will always remember your jungle adventure.” 

“I don’t think I could forget it too easily,” I replied. Then I said good night 
and made my way to bed. 

The next morning, I woke up early and pulled on my clothes as fast as I could. I 
couldn’t wait to get to school and show off the shrunken head to Eric and Joel 
and all the other kids. 

I gulped down my cornflakes and chugged my orange juice. I strapped on 
my backpack. Called good-bye to Mom. Grabbed the shrunken head and headed 
out the door. 

Holding the head carefully in my hand, I started to jog along the sidewalk. 
It was a bright, sunny day. The air smelled warm and sweet. 

My school is only three blocks from my house. But as I jogged along, it 
seemed like miles. 

I couldn’t wait to get there and show off to everyone. 

I couldn’t wait to tell my friends about all my jungle adventures. 

I could see the school in the next block. And I could see a bunch of kids 
hanging out by the front door. 

As I ran across the street, I suddenly felt the head move in my hand. 

It twitched. 

“Huh?” I let out a gasp and stared down at it. 

The eyes blinked, then stared up at me. The lips closed, then opened again. 
“Hey, kid,” the head growled. “Let me tell the part about the tiger!”

NIGHT OF THE 
LIVING DUMMY III 


Goosebumps - 40 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


The stairs up to my attic are narrow and steep. The fifth step is loose and 
wobbles when you stand on it. All the other stairs creak and groan. 

My whole house creaks and groans. It’s a big, old house. And it’s kind of 
falling apart. Mom and Dad don’t really have the money to repair it. 

“Trina—hurry!” my brother, Dan, whispered. His words echoed in the steep 
attic stairwell. Dan is ten, and he is always in a hurry. 

He’s short and very skinny. I think he looks like a mouse. He has short 
brown hair, dark eyes, and a pointy little chin. And he’s always scurrying around 
like a mouse searching for a place to hide. 

Sometimes I call him Mouse. You know. Like a nickname. Dan hates it. So 
I only call him Mouse when I want to make him mad. 

Dan and I don’t look at all like brother and sister. I’m tall and I have curly 
red hair and green eyes. I’m a little chubby, but Mom says not to worry about it. 
I’ll probably slim down by the time I’m thirteen, next August. 

Anyway, no one would ever call me Mouse! For one thing, I’m a lot braver 
than Dan. 

You have to be brave to go up to our attic. Not because of the creaking 
stairs. Or the way the wind whistles through the attic windows and makes the 
panes rattle. Not because of the dim light up there. Or the shadows. Or the low 
ceiling covered with cracks. 

You have to be brave because of the eyes. 

The dozens of eyes that stare at you through the darkness. 

The eyes that never blink. The eyes that stare with such eerie, heavy 
silence. 

Dan reached the attic ahead of me. I heard him take a few steps over the 
squeaking, wooden floorboards. Then I heard him stop. 

I knew why he stopped. He was staring back at the eyes, at the grinning 
faces. 

I crept up behind him, moving on tiptoe. I leaned my face close to his ear. 
And I shouted, “BOO!” 

He didn’t jump. 

“Trina, you’re about as funny as a wet sponge,” he said. He shoved me 



away. 

“I think wet sponges are funny,” I replied. I admit it. I like to annoy him. 

“Give me a break,” Dan muttered. 

I grabbed his arm. “Okay.” I pretended to break it in two. 

I know it’s dumb. But that’s the way my brother and I kid around all the 

time. 

Dad says we didn’t get our sense of humor from him. But I think we 
probably did. 

Dad owns a little camera store now. But before that he was a ventriloquist. 
You know. He did a comedy act with a dummy. 

Danny O’Dell and Wilbur. 

That was the name of the act. Wilbur was the dummy, in case you didn’t 
guess it. 

Danny O’Dell is my dad. My brother is Dan, Jr. But he hates the word 
junior, so no one ever calls him that. 

Except me. When I want to make him really mad! 

“Someone left the attic light on,” Dan said, pointing to the ceiling light. The 
only light in the whole attic. 

Our attic is one big room. There are windows at both ends. But they are 
both caked with dust, so not much light gets through. 

Dan and I made our way across the room. The dummies all stared at us, 
their eyes big and blank. Most of them had wide grins on their wooden faces. 
Some of their mouths hung open. Some of their heads tilted down so we couldn’t 
see their faces. 

Wilbur—Dad’s first dummy, the original Wilbur—was perched on an old 
armchair. His hands were draped over the chair arms. His head tilted against the 
chair back. 

Dan laughed. “Wilbur looks just like Dad taking a nap!” 

I laughed, too. With his short brown hair, his black eyeglasses, and his 
goofy grin, Wilbur looked a lot like Dad! 

The old dummy’s black-and-yellow checked sports jacket was worn and 
frayed. But Wilbur’s face was freshly painted. His black leather shoes were 
shiny. 

One wooden hand had part of the thumb chipped out. But Wilbur looked 
great for such an old dummy. 

Dad keeps all of the dummies in good shape. He calls the attic his Dummy 



Museum. Spread around the room are a dozen old ventriloquist’s dummies that 
he has collected. 

He spends all of his spare time fixing them up. Painting them. Giving them 
fresh wigs. Making new suits and pants for them. Working on their insides, 
making sure their eyes and mouths move correctly. 

These days, Dad doesn’t get to use his ventriloquist skills very often. 
Sometimes he’ll take one of the dummies to a kid’s birthday party and put on a 
show. Sometimes people in town will invite him to perform at a party to raise 
money for a school or library. 

But most of the time the dummies just sit up here, staring at each other. 

Some of them are propped against the attic wall. Some are sprawled out on 
the couch. Some of them sit in folding chairs, hands crossed in their laps. Wilbur 
is the only one lucky enough to have his own armchair. 

When Dan and I were little, we were afraid to come up to the attic. I didn’t 
like the way the dummies stared at me. I thought their grins were evil. 

Dan liked to stick his hand into their backs and move their mouths. He 
made the dummies say frightening things. 

“I’m going to get you, Trina!” he would make Rocky growl. Rocky is the 
mean-faced dummy that sneers instead of smiles. He’s dressed like a tough guy 
in a red-and-white striped T-shirt and black jeans. He’s really evil-looking, “I’m 
coming to your room tonight, Trina. And I’m going to GET you!” 

“Stop it, Dan! Stop it!” I would scream. Then I would go running 
downstairs and tell Mom that Dan was scaring me. 

I was only eight or nine. 

I’m a lot older now. And braver. But I still feel a little creeped out when I 
come up here. 

I know it’s dumb. But sometimes I imagine the dummies sitting around up 
here, talking to each other, giggling and laughing. 

Sometimes late at night when I’m lying in bed, the ceiling creaks over my 
head. Footsteps! I picture the dummies walking around in the attic, their heavy 
black shoes clonking over the floorboards. 

I picture them wrestling around on the old couch. Or playing a wild game 
of catch, their wooden hands snapping as they catch the ball. 

Dumb? Of course it’s dumb. 

But I can’t help it. 

They’re supposed to be funny little guys. But they scare me. 



I hate the way they stare at me without blinking. And I hate the red-lipped 
grins frozen on their faces. 

Dan and I come up to the attic because Dan likes to play with them. And 
because I like to see how Dad fixes them up. 

But I really don’t like to come up to the attic alone. 

Dan picked up Miss Lucy. That’s the only girl dummy in the group. She has 
curly blond hair and bright blue eyes. 

My brother stuck his hand into the dummy’s back and perched her on his 
knee. “Hi, Trina,” he made the dummy say in a high, shrill voice. 

Dan started to make her say something else. 

But he stopped suddenly. His mouth dropped open—like a dummy’s—and 
he pointed across the room. 

“Trina—1-look!” Dan stammered. “Over there!” 

I turned quickly. And I saw Rocky, the mean-looking dummy, blink his 

eyes. 

I gasped as the dummy leaned forward and sneered. “Trina, I’m going to 
GET you!” he growled.

I uttered a startled cry and jumped back. 

I swung around, ready to run to the attic steps—and I saw Dan laughing. 

“Hey—!” I cried out angrily. “What’s going on here?” 

I turned back to see Dad climb to his feet behind Rocky’s chair. He carried 
Rocky in one arm. Dad’s grin was as wide as a dummy’s! 

“Gotcha!” he cried in Rocky’s voice. 

I turned angrily on my brother. “Did you know Dad was back there? Did 
you know Dad was here the whole time?” 

Dan nodded. “Of course.” 

“You two are both dummies!” I cried. I flung my red hair back with both 
hands and let out an exasperated sigh. “That was so stupid!” 

“You fell for it,” Dan shot back, grinning at Dad. 

“Who’s the dummy here?” Dad made Rocky say. “Hey—who’s pulling 
your string? I’m not a dummy—knock on wood!” 

Dan laughed, but I just shook my head. 

Dad refused to give up. “Hey—come over here!” he made Rocky say. 
“Scratch my back. I think I’ve got termites!” 

I gave in and laughed. I’d heard that joke a million times. But I knew Dad 
wouldn’t stop trying until I laughed. 

He’s a really good ventriloquist. You can never see his lips move. But his 
jokes are totally lame. 

I guess that’s why he had to give up the act and open a camera store. I don’t 
know for sure. It all happened before I was born. 

Dad set Rocky back on his chair. The dummy sneered up at us. Such a bad- 
news dummy. Why couldn’t he smile like the others? 

Dad pushed his eyeglasses up on his nose. “Come over here,” he said. “I 
want to show you something.” 

He put one hand on my shoulder and one hand on Dan’s shoulder and led us 
to the other end of the big attic room. This is where Dad has his workshop—his 
worktable and all his tools and supplies for fixing up the dummies. 

Dad reached under the worktable and pulled up a large brown-paper 
shopping bag. I could tell by the smile on his face what he had in the bag. But I 



didn’t say anything to min his surprise. 

Slowly, carefully, Dad reached into the shopping bag. His smile grew wider 
as he lifted out a dummy. “Hey, guys—check this out!” Dad exclaimed. 

The dummy had been folded up inside the bag. Dad set it down flat on the 
worktable and carefully unfolded the arms and legs. He looked like a surgeon 
starting an operation. 

“I found this one in a trash can,” he told us. “Do you believe someone just 
threw it away?” 

He tilted the dummy up so we could see it. I followed Dan up to the 
worktable to get a better look. 

“The head was split in two,” Dad said, placing one hand at the back of the 
dummy’s neck. “But it took two seconds to repair it. Just a little glue.” 

I leaned close to check out Dad’s new treasure. It had wavy brown hair 
painted on top of its head. The face was kind of strange. Kind of intense. 

The eyes were bright blue. They shimmered. Sort of like real eyes. The 
dummy had bright red painted lips, curved up into a smile. 

An ugly smile, I thought. Kind of gross and nasty. 

His lower lip had a chip on one side so that it didn’t quite match the other 
lip. 

The dummy wore a gray double-breasted suit over a white shirt collar. The 
collar was stapled to his neck. 

He didn’t have a shirt. Instead, his wooden chest had been painted white. 
Big black leather shoes—very scuffed up—dangled from his skinny gray pants 
legs. 

“Can you believe someone just tossed him into the trash?” Dad repeated. 
“Isn’t he great?” 

“Yeah. Great,” I murmured. I didn’t like the new dummy at all. I didn’t like 
his face, the way his blue eyes gleamed, the crooked smile. 

Dan must have felt the same way. “He’s kind of tough-looking,” he said. He 
picked up one of the dummy’s wooden hands. It had deep scratches all over it. 
The knuckles appeared cut and bruised. As if the dummy had been in a fight. 

“Not as tough-looking as Rocky over there,” Dad replied. “But he does 
have a strange smile.” He picked at the small chip in the dummy’s lip. “I can fill 
that in with some liquid wood filler. Then I’ll give the whole face a fresh paint 
job.” 

“What’s the dummy’s name?” I asked. 



Dad shrugged. “Beats me. Maybe we’ll call him Smiley.” 

“Smiley?” I made a disgusted face. 

Dad started to reply. But the phone rang downstairs. One ring. Two. Three. 

“I guess your mom is still at that school meeting,” Dad said. He ran to the 
stairs. “I’d better answer it. Don’t touch Smiley till I get back.” He vanished 
down the stairs. 

I picked up the dummy’s head carefully in both hands. “Dad did a great 
gluing job,” I said. 

“He should do your head next!” Dan shot back. 

Typical. 

“I don’t think Smiley is a good name for him,” Dan said, slapping the 
dummy’s hands together. 

“How about Dan Junior?” I suggested. “Or Dan the Third?” 

He ignored me. “How many dummies does Dad have now?” He turned 
back toward the others across the attic and quickly counted them. 

I counted faster. “This new one makes thirteen,” I said. 

Dan’s eyes went wide. “Whoa. That’s an unlucky number.” 

“Well, if we count you, it’s fourteen!” I said. 

Gotcha, Danny Boy! 

Dan stuck out his tongue at me. He set the dummy’s hands down on its 
chest. “Hey—what’s that?” He reached into the pocket of the gray suit jacket and 
pulled out a folded-up slip of paper. 

“Maybe that has the dummy’s name on it,” I said. I grabbed the paper out of 
Dan’s hands and raised it to my face. I unfolded it and started to read. 

“Well?” Dan tried to grab it back. But I swung out of his reach. “What’s the 
name?” 

“It doesn’t say,” I told him. “There are just these weird words. Foreign, I 
guess.” 

I moved my lips silently as I struggled to read them. Then I read the words 
out loud: “Karru marri odonna loma molonu karrano. ” 

Dan’s mouth dropped open. “Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?” he 
cried. 

He grabbed the paper from my hand. “I think you read it upside down!” 

“No way!” I protested. 

I glanced down at the dummy. 

The glassy blue eyes stared up at me. 



Then the right eye slowly closed. The dummy winked at me. 

And then his left hand shot straight up—and slapped me in the face.

“Hey—!” I shouted. I jerked back as pain shot through my jaw. 

“What’s your problem?” Dan demanded, glancing up from the slip of paper. 

“Didn’t you see?” I shrieked. “He—he slapped me!” I rubbed my cheek. 

Dan rolled his eyes. “Yeah. For sure.” 

“No—really!” I cried. “First he winked at me. Then he slapped me.” 

“Tell me another one,” Dan groaned. “You’re such a jerk, Trina. Just 
because you fall for Dad’s jokes doesn’t mean I’m going to fall for yours.” 

“But I’m telling the truth!” I insisted. 

I glanced up to see Dad poke his head up at the top of the stairs. “What’s 
going on, guys?” 

Dan folded up the slip of paper and tucked it back into the dummy’s jacket 
pocket. “Nothing much,” he told Dad. 

“Dad—the new dummy!” I cried, still rubbing my aching jaw. “He slapped 

me!” 

Dad laughed. “Sorry, Trina. You’ll have to do better than that. You can’t kid 
a kidder.” 

That’s one of Dad’s favorite expressions: “You can’t kid a kidder.” 

“But, Dad—” I stopped. I could see he wasn’t going to believe me. I wasn’t 
even sure I believed it myself. 

I glanced down at the dummy. He stared blankly up at the ceiling. Totally 
lifeless. 

“I have news, guys,” Dad said, sitting the new dummy up. “That was my 
brother—your uncle Cal—on the phone. He’s coming for a short visit while 
Aunt Susan’s away on business. And he’s bringing your cousin Zane with him. 
It’s Zane’s spring vacation from school, too.” 

Dan and I both groaned. Dan stuck his finger in his mouth and pretended to 
puke. 

Zane isn’t our favorite cousin. 

He’s our only cousin. 

He’s twelve, but you’d think he was five or six. He’s pretty nerdy. His nose 
mns a lot. And he’s kind of a wimp. 

Kind of a major wimp. 



“Hey, stop groaning,” Dad scolded. “Zane is your only cousin. He’s 
family.” 

Dan and I groaned again. We couldn’t help it. 

“He isn’t a bad kid,” Dad continued, narrowing his eyes at us behind his 
glasses. That meant he was being serious. “You two have to promise me 
something.” 

“What kind of promise?” I asked. 

“You have to promise me that you’ll be nicer to Zane this time.” 

“We were nice to him last time,” Dan insisted. “We talked to him, didn’t 

we?” 

“You scared him to death last time,” Dad said, frowning. “You made him 
believe that this old house is haunted. And you scared him so badly, he ran 
outside and refused to come back in.” 

“Dad, it was all a joke,” I protested. 

“Yeah. It was a scream!” Dan agreed. He poked me in the side with his 
elbow. “A scream. Get it?” 

“Not funny,” Dad said unhappily. “Not funny at all. Listen, guys—Zane 
can’t help it if he’s a little timid. He’ll outgrow it. You just have to be nice to 
him.” 

Dan snickered. “Zane is afraid of your dummies, Dad. Can you believe it?” 
“Then don’t drag him up here and scare the life out of him,” Dad ordered. 
“How about if we just play one or two little jokes on him?” Dan asked. 

“No tricks,” Dad replied firmly. “None.” 

Dan and I exchanged glances. 

“Promise me,” Dad insisted. “I mean it. Right now. Both of you. Promise 
me there will be no tricks. Promise me you won’t try to scare your cousin.” 

“Okay. I promise,” I said. I raised my right hand as if I were swearing an 

oath. 

“I promise, too,” Dan said softly. 

I checked to see if his fingers were crossed. They weren’t. 

Dan and I had both made a solemn promise. We both promised not to terrify 
our cousin. And we meant it. 

But it was a promise we couldn’t keep. 

Before the week was over, our cousin Zane would be terrified. 

And so would we.

I was playing the piano when Zane arrived. The piano is tucked away in a small 
room in the back of the house. It’s a small black upright piano, kind of beat-up 
and scratched. Dad bought it from my old music teacher who moved to 
Cleveland. 

Two of the pedals don’t work. And the piano really needs to be tuned. But I 
love to play it—especially when I’m stressed out or excited. It always helps to 
calm me down. 

I’m pretty good at it. Even Dan agrees. Most of the time he pushes me off 
the piano bench so he can play “Chopsticks”. But sometimes he stands beside 
me and listens. I’ve been practicing some nice Haydn pieces and some of the 
easy Chopin etudes. 

Anyway, I was in the back of the house banging away on the piano when 
Zane and Uncle Cal arrived. I guess I was a little nervous about seeing Zane 
again. 

Dan and I were really mean to him during his last visit. Like Dad said, Zane 
has always been scared of this old house. And we did everything we could to 
make him even more scared. 

We walked around in the attic every night, howling softly like ghosts, 
making the floor creak. We crept into his bedroom closet in the middle of the 
night and made him think his clothes were dancing. We rigged a pair of Mom’s 
panty hose so they cast a ghostly shadow of legs onto his bedroom floor. 

Poor Zane. I think Dan and I went a little too far. After a few days, he 
jumped at every sound. And his eyes kept darting from side to side like a 
frightened lizard’s. 

I heard him tell Uncle Cal that he never wanted to come back here. 

Dan and I laughed about that. But it wasn’t very nice. 

So I was a little nervous about seeing Zane again. I was playing the piano 
so loudly, I didn’t hear the doorbell. Dan had to come running in and tell me 
Uncle Cal and Zane had arrived. 

I jumped up from the piano bench. “How does Zane look?” I asked my 
brother. 

“Big,” Dan replied. “He grew. A lot. And he let his hair grow long.” 



Zane was always a pretty big guy. That’s why Dan and I thought his being a 
total wimp was so funny. 

He’s big and beefy. Not tall. He’s built kind of like a bulldog. A big blond 
bulldog. 

I guess he’s actually good-looking. He has round blue eyes, wavy blond 
hair, and a nice smile. He looks as if he works out or plays sports. He really 
doesn’t look like the wimp type at all. 

That’s why it’s such a riot to see him quivering in fear. Or wailing like a 
baby. Running to his mom or dad in terror. 

I followed Dan through the back hall. “Did Zane say anything to you?” I 
asked. 

“Just hi,” Dan replied. 

“A friendly ‘hi’ or an unfriendly ‘hi’?” I demanded. 

Dan didn’t have time to answer. We had reached the front hall. 

“Hey—!” Uncle Cal greeted me, stretching out his arms for a hug. Uncle 
Cal looks a lot like a chipmunk. He’s very small. He has a round face, a twitchy 
little nose, and two teeth that poke out from his upper lip. 

“You’re getting so tall!” he exclaimed as I hugged him. “You’ve grown a 
lot, Trina!” 

Why do grown-ups always have to comment on how tall kids are getting? 
Can’t they think of anything else to say? 

I saw Dad lugging their two heavy suitcases up the stairs. 

“I didn’t know if you’d be hungry or not,” Mom told Uncle Cal. “So I made 
a bunch of sandwiches.” 

I turned to say hi to Zane. And a flash of white light made me cry out in 
surprise. 

“Don’t move. One more,” I heard Zane say. 

I blinked rapidly, trying to clear the light from my eyes. When I finally 
focused, I saw that Zane had a camera up to his face. 

He clicked it. Another bright flash of light. 

“That’s good,” he said. “You looked really surprised. I only like to take 
candid shots.” 

“Zane is really into photography,” Uncle Cal said, grinning proudly. 

“I’m blind!” I cried, rubbing my eyes. 

“I needed extra flash because this house is so dark,” Zane said. He lowered 
his head to the camera and fiddled with his lens. 



Dad came shuffling down the stairs. Zane turned and snapped his picture. 

“Zane is really into photography,” Uncle Cal repeated to my father. “I told 
him maybe you’ve got an old camera or two at the shop that he could have.” 

“Uh... maybe,” Dad replied. 

Uncle Cal makes a lot more money than Dad. But whenever he visits, he 
always tries to get Dad to give him stuff. 

“Nice camera,” Dad told Zane. “What kind of photos do you like to take?” 

“Candid shots,” Zane replied, pushing back his blond hair. “And I take a lot 
of still lifes.” He stepped into the hall and flashed a close-up of the banister. 

Dan leaned close and whispered in my ear, “He’s still a pain. Let’s give him 
a really good scare.” 

“No way!” I whispered back. “No scares this time. We promised Dad— 
remember?” 

“I’ve set up a darkroom in the basement,” Dad told Zane. “Sometimes I 
bring developing work home from the store. You can use the darkroom this 
week, if you want to.” 

“Great!” Zane replied. 

“I told Zane maybe you have some sheets of developing paper you can 
spare,” Uncle Cal said to Dad. 

Zane raised his camera and flashed another picture. Then he turned to Dan. 
“Are you still into video games?” he asked. 

“Yeah,” Dan replied. “Mostly sports games. I have the new NBA Jams. And 
I’m saving my allowance to get the new thirty-two-bit system. You still play?” 

Zane shook his head. “Not since I got my camera. I don’t really have time 
for games anymore.” 

“How about some sandwiches, everyone?” Mom asked, moving toward the 
dining room. 

“I think I’d like to unpack first,” Uncle Cal told her. “Zane, you should 
unpack, too.” 

We all split up. Dan and Dad disappeared somewhere. Uncle Cal and Zane 
went up to their rooms to unpack—our big old house has a lot of extra 
bedrooms. 

I was heading into the kitchen to help Mom with the sandwiches when I 
heard Zane scream. 

A shrill scream from upstairs. 

A scream of horror.

Mom gasped and dropped the sandwich tray she was carrying. 

I spun around and went running to the front hall. 

Dad was already halfway up the stairs. “What’s wrong?” he called. “Zane— 
what’s the matter?” 

When I reached the second floor, I saw Dan step out of his room. Zane 
stood in the hallway. Someone lay stretched across the floor at his feet. 

Even from halfway down the hall, I could see that Zane was trembling. 

I hurried over to him. 

Who was sprawled on the floor like that, legs and arms all twisted? 

“Zane—what happened? What happened?” Dad and Uncle Cal both 
shouted. 

Zane stood there shaking all over. The camera seemed to tremble, too, 
swinging on its strap over his chest. 

I glanced down at the body on the floor. 

A ventriloquist’s dummy. 

Rocky. 

Rocky sneered up at the ceiling. His red-and-white striped shirt had rolled 
up halfway, revealing his wooden body. One leg was bent under him. Both arms 
were stretched out over the floor. 

“That d-dummy—” Zane stammered, pointing down at Rocky. “It—it fell 
on me when I opened the bedroom door.” 

“Huh? It what?” Uncle Cal cried. 

“It dropped down on me,” Zane repeated. “When I pushed the door. I didn’t 
mean to scream. It just scared me, that’s all. It was so heavy. And it fell near my 
head.” 

I turned and saw Dad glaring angrily at Dan. 

Dan raised both hands in protest. “Hey—don’t look at me!” he cried. 

“Dan, you made a promise,” Dad said sharply. 

“I didn’t do it!” Dan cried. “It had to be Trina!” 

“Hey—no way!” I protested. “No way! I didn’t do it!” 

Dad narrowed his eyes at me. “I suppose the dummy climbed up on top of 



the door by himself!” he said, rolling his eyes. 

“It was just a joke,” Uncle Cal chimed in. “You’re okay—right, Zane?” 

“Yeah. Sure.” Zane’s cheeks were red. I could see he was embarrassed by 
all the fuss. “I just wasn’t expecting something to fall on me. You know.” He 
stared at the floor. 

“Let’s finish unpacking,” Uncle Cal suggested. “I’m starting to get hungry.” 
He turned to Dad. “Do you have any extra pillows? There’s only one on my bed. 
And I like to sleep with a lot of pillows.” 

“I’ll see if we have any more,” Dad replied. He frowned at me. “You and 
Dan—take Rocky up to the attic. And no more little jokes. You promised— 
remember?” 

I picked Rocky up carefully and slung him over my shoulder. “Get the attic 
door for me,” I instructed Dan. 

We made our way down the hall. “What is your problem, Mouse?” I 
whispered to my brother. 

“Don’t call me Mouse,” he replied through gritted teeth. “You know I hate 
it.” 

“Well, I hate broken promises,” I told him. “You can’t wait one minute to 
start scaring Zane? You’re going to get us in major trouble.” 

“Me?” Dan put on his innocent act. “I didn’t hide the dummy up there. You 
did—and you know it!” 

“Did not!” I whispered angrily. 

“Hey, guys, can I come with you?” I turned to see Zane right behind us. I 
hadn’t realized he’d followed us. 

“You want to come up to the Dummy Museum?” I asked, unable to hide my 
surprise. Last visit, Zane had been afraid of the dummies. 

“Yeah. I want to take some pictures,” he replied. He raised his camera in 
both hands. 

“Cool,” Dan said. “That’s a cool idea.” I could see that he was trying to be 
friendly to Zane. 

I didn’t want to be left out. “It’s neat that you’re into photography,” I told 
Zane. 

“Yeah. I know,” he replied. 

Dan led the way up the attic stairs. Halfway up, I turned back. I saw Zane 
lingering at the bottom. 

“Are you coming up or not?” I called down. My voice echoed in the 



narrow, dark stairwell. 

I caught a look of fear on Zane’s face. He was trying to be brave, I realized. 
Trying not to be afraid the way he was last time. 

“Coming,” he called up. I saw him take a deep breath. Then he came 
mnning up the stairs. 

He stayed close to Dan and me as we crossed the attic. The eyes peered out 
at us darkly from around the big room. 

I clicked on the light. The dummies all came into view. Propped on chairs 
and the old couch, leaning against the wall, they grinned at us. 

I carried Rocky over to his folding chair. I slid him off my shoulder and set 
him down. I crossed his arms in his lap and straightened his striped shirt. The 
mean-looking dummy sneered up at me. 

“Uncle Danny has a few new guys,” Zane said from across the room. He 
stood close to Dan in front of the couch. He held the camera in his hands, but he 
didn’t take any pictures. “Where does he find them?” 

“He found the newest one in a trash can,” I replied, pointing to the mean¬ 
looking dummy. 

Dan picked up Miss Lucy and held it up to Zane. “Hiya, Zane! Take my 
picture!” Dan made Miss Lucy say in a high, shrill voice. 

Zane obediently raised the camera to his eye. “Say cheese,” he told Miss 
Lucy. 

“Cheese,” Dan said in Miss Lucy’s high voice. 

Zane flashed a picture. 

“Give me a big wet kiss!” Dan made Miss Lucy say. He shoved the 
dummy’s face close to Zane’s. 

Zane backed away. “Yuck.” 

“Put the dummy down,” I told my brother. “We’d better get back 
downstairs. They’re all probably waiting for us.” 

“Okay, okay,” Dan grumbled. He turned to set Miss Lucy down. Zane 
wandered down the row of dummies, studying them. 

I bent down and straightened Wilbur’s bow tie. The old dummy was 
starting to look really ragged. 

I was still working on the bow tie when I heard a hard slap. 

And I heard Zane’s startled cry of pain. 

“Owwww!” 



6 


I spun around and saw Zane rubbing his jaw. 

“Hey—that dummy slapped me!” he cried angrily. 

He pointed to a red-haired dummy on the arm of the couch. 

“I-I don’t believe it!” Zane exclaimed. “It swung its arm up, and it—it 
slapped me!” 

Dan stood behind the couch. I saw a smile spread over his face. Then he 
burst out laughing. “Get serious,” he told Zane. “That’s impossible.” 

“You did it!” Zane accused my brother, still rubbing his jaw. “You moved 
the dummy!” 

“No way!” Dan backed away till he bumped the wall. “How could I? I was 
behind the couch the whole time.” 

I stepped quickly up to the couch. “Which dummy was it?” I demanded. 

Zane pointed to a dummy with red hair and bright red freckles painted all 
over his grinning face. “That guy.” 

“Arnie,” I reported. “One of Dad’s first dummies.” 

“I don’t care what his name is,” Zane snapped. “He slapped me!” 

“But that’s dumb,” I insisted. “It’s just a ventriloquist’s dummy, Zane. Here. 
Look.” 

I picked Arnie up. The old dummy was heavier than I remembered. I started 
to hand him to Zane. But my cousin backed away. 

“Something weird is going on here,” Zane said, keeping his eyes on the 
dummy. “I’m going to tell Uncle Danny.” 

“No. Don’t tell Dad,” I pleaded. “Give us a break, Zane. It’ll get us in big 
trouble.” 

“Yeah. Don’t tell,” Dan chimed in. “The dummy probably just slipped or 
something. You know. It fell over.” 

“It reached up,” Zane insisted. “I saw it swing its arm and—” 

He was interrupted by Mom’s voice from downstairs. “Hurry up, kids. Get 
down here. We’re all waiting for you.” 

“Coming!” I shouted. I dropped Arnie back onto the arm of the couch. He 
fell into the dummy next to him. I left him like that and followed Dan and Zane 
to the stairs. 



I held Dan back and let Zane go down by himself. “What are you trying to 
prove?” I angrily asked my brother. “That wasn’t funny.” 

“Trina, I didn’t do it. I swear!” Dan claimed, raising his right hand. “I 
swear!” 

“So what are you saying?” I demanded. “That the dummy really reached up 
and slapped him?” 

Dan twisted his face. He shrugged. “I don’t know. I just know that I didn’t 
do it. I didn’t swing that dummy’s arm.” 

“Don’t be stupid,” I replied. “Of course you did.” I shoved my brother 
toward the stairs. 

“Hey—give me a break,” he muttered. 

“You’re a total liar,” I told him. “You think you can scare Zane—and me. 
But it isn’t worth it, Dan. We promised Dad, remember? Remember?” 

He ignored me and started down the stairs. 

I felt really angry. I knew that Dan had perched the dummy on top of the 
bedroom door so that it would fall on Zane. And I knew that he had swung the 
dummy’s arm to slap Zane. 

I wondered how far Dan would go to frighten our cousin. 

I knew I had to stop him. If Dan kept this up, he’d get us both grounded for 
life. Or worse. 

But what could I do? 

I was still thinking about it in bed later that night. I couldn’t get to sleep. I 
lay there, staring up at the ceiling, thinking about Dan and what a liar he was. 

Dummies are made of wood and cloth, I told myself. They don’t swing their 
arms and slap people. 

And they don’t get up and walk around the house and climb up onto doors 
on their own. They don’t walk on their own.... 

They don’t... 

I finally started to drift off to sleep when I heard light footsteps on my 
bedroom carpet. 

And then a hoarse whisper close to my ear: 

“Trina... Trina...” 



7 


“Trina... Trina...” 

The hoarse whisper—so near my ear—made me shoot straight up in bed. 

I leaped to my feet. Pulled the covers with me. Lurched forward. 

And nearly knocked Zane onto his back. 

“Zane?” 

He stumbled backwards. “Sorry!” he whispered. “I thought you were 
awake.” 

“Zane!” I repeated. My heart thudded in my chest. “What are you doing in 
here?” 

“Sorry,” he whispered, backing up some more. He stopped a few inches in 
front of my dresser. “I didn’t mean to scare you. I just—” 

I held my hand over my heart. I could feel it start to slow back down to 
normal. “Sorry I jumped out at you like that,” I told him. “I was half asleep, I 
guess. And when you whispered my name...” 

I clicked on the bed-table lamp. I rubbed my eyes and squinted at Zane. 

He was wearing baggy blue pajamas. One pajama leg had rolled up nearly 
to his knee. His blond hair had fallen over his face. He had such a frightened, 
little-boy expression on his face. He looked about six years old! 

“I tried to wake up Dad,” he whispered. “But he’s such a sound sleeper. I 
kept knocking on his bedroom door and calling to him. But he didn’t hear me. So 
I came in here.” 

“What’s your problem?” I asked, stretching my arms over my head. 

“I-I heard voices,” he stammered, glancing to the open bedroom door. 

“Excuse me? Voices?” I pushed my hair back. Straightened my long 
nightshirt. Studied him. 

He nodded. “I heard voices. Upstairs. I mean, I think they were upstairs. 
Funny voices. Talking very fast.” 

I squinted at him. “You heard voices in the attic ? ” 

He nodded again. “Yeah. I’m pretty sure.” 

“I’m pretty sure you were dreaming.” I sighed. I shook my head. 

“No. I was wide awake. Really.” He picked up a little stuffed bear from my 
dresser. He squeezed it between his hands. 



“I never sleep very well in new places,” he told me. “I never sleep very well 
in this house!” He let out an unhappy laugh. “I was wide awake.” 

“There’s no one in the attic,” I said, yawning. I tilted my ear to the ceiling. 
“Listen,” I instructed. “Silent up there. No voices.” 

We both listened to the silence for a while. 

Then Zane set down the stuffed bear. “Do you think I could have a bowl of 
cereal?” he asked. 

“Huh?” I gaped at him. 

“A bowl of cereal always helps calm me down,” he said. An embarrassed 
smile crossed his face. “Just a habit from when I was a kid.” 

I squinted at my clock radio. It was a little after midnight. “You want a 
bowl of cereal now?” 

He nodded. “Is that okay?” he asked shyly. 

Poor guy, I thought. He’s really freaked out. 

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll come down to the kitchen with you. Show you where 
everything is.” 

I found my flip-flops and slipped my feet into them. I keep them under my 
bed. I don’t like walking barefoot on the floorboards in the hall. There are a lot 
of nails that poke up from the floor. 

Mom and Dad keep saying they’re going to buy carpet. But money is tight. 
I don’t think carpet is tops on their list. 

Zane appeared a little calmer. I smiled at him and led the way into the hall. 

He’s not such a bad guy, I thought. He’s a little wimpy—but so what? I 
decided to have a serious talk with Dan first thing in the morning. I planned to 
make Dan promise he wouldn’t pull any more scares on Zane. 

The long hall was so dark, Zane and I both held onto the wall as we made 
our way to the stairs. Mom and Dad used to keep a little night-light at the end of 
the hall. But the bulb burned out, and they never replaced it. 

Holding onto the banister, we made our way slowly down the steps. Pale 
light from outside cast long blue shadows over the living room. In the dim light, 
our old furniture rose up like ghosts around the room. 

“This house always creeps me out,” Zane whispered, staying close by my 
side as we crossed through the front room. 

“I’ve lived here all my life, and sometimes I’m scared of it, too,” I 
confessed. “Old houses make so many strange sounds. Sometimes I think I hear 
the house groaning and moaning.” 



“I really did hear voices,” Zane whispered. 

We crept through the shadows to the kitchen. My flip-flops slapped on the 
linoleum. Silvery moonlight washed through the curtains over the kitchen 
window. 

I started to fumble on the wall for the light switch. 

But I stopped when I saw the dark figure slumped at the kitchen table. 

Zane saw him, too. I heard Zane gasp. He jerked back into the doorway. 
“Dad? Are you still up?” I called. “Why are you sitting in the dark?” 

My hand found the light switch. I clicked on the kitchen light. 

And Zane and I both let out a scream. 



8 


I recognized the red-and-white striped shirt. I didn’t even have to see the face. 

Rocky leaned over the table, his wooden head propped in his hands. 

Zane and I crept closer to the table. I moved to the other side. The dummy 
sneered at me. His glassy eyes were cold and cruel. 

Such a nasty expression. 

“How did he get down here?” Zane asked. He stared hard at the dummy, as 
if expecting the dummy to answer. 

“Only one way,” I murmured. “He sure didn’t walk.” 

Zane turned to me. “You mean Dan?” 

I sighed. “Of course. Who else? Mister Dumb Jokes.” 

“But how did your brother know we’d be coming down to the kitchen 
tonight?” Zane asked. 

“Let’s go ask him,” I replied. 

I knew Dan was awake. Probably sitting on the edge of his bed, waiting 
eagerly to hear us scream from the kitchen. Giggling to himself. So pleased with 
himself. 

So pleased that he broke his promise to Dad. And gave Zane and me a little 
scare. 

I balled both hands into tight fists. I could feel the anger rising in my chest. 

When I get really furious like that, I usually go to the back room and pound 
the piano. I pound out a Sousa march or a hard, fast rock song. I pound the keys 
till I start to calm down. 

Tonight, I decided, I would pound my brother instead. 

“Come on,” I urged Zane. “Upstairs.” 

I took one last glance at Rocky, slouched over the kitchen table. The 
dummy stared blankly back at me. 

I really hate that dummy, I thought. I’m going to ask Dad to put him away 
in a closet or a trunk. 

I forced myself to turn away from the sneering, wooden face. Then I put 
both hands on Zane’s shoulders and guided him back to the stairs. 

“I’m going to tell Dan that we’re both fed up with his dumb jokes,” I 
whispered to my cousin. “Enough is enough. We’ll make him promise to stop 



leaving that dummy everywhere we go.” 

Zane didn’t reply. In the dim light, I could see the grim expression on his 

face. 

I wondered what he was thinking about. Was he remembering his last visit 
to our house? Was he remembering how Dan and I terrified him then? 

Maybe he doesn’t trust me, either, I told myself. 

We climbed the stairs and crept down the dark hallway to my brother’s 
room. 

The door was half open. I pushed it open the rest of the way and stepped 
inside. Zane kept close behind me. 

I expected Dan to be sitting up, waiting for us. I expected to see him 
grinning, enjoying his little joke. 

Silvery moonlight flooded in through his double windows. From the 
doorway, I could see him clearly. Lying on his side in bed. Covers up to his chin. 
Eyes tightly closed. 

Was he faking? Was he really awake? 

“Dan,” I whispered. “Da-an.” 

He didn’t move. His eyes didn’t open. 

“Dan—I’m coming to tickle you!” I whispered. He could never keep a 
straight face when I threatened him. Dan is very ticklish. 

But he didn’t move. 

Zane and I crept closer. Up to the bed. We both stood over my brother, 
staring hard at him, studying him in the silvery light. 

He was breathing softly, in a steady rhythm. His mouth was open a little. 
He made short whistling sounds. Mouse sounds. With his pointy chin and 
upturned nose, he really did look like a little mouse. 

I leaned over him. “Da-an, get ready to be tickled!” I whispered. 

I leaned back, expecting him to leap out at me, to shout “Boo!” or 
something. 

But he continued sleeping, whistling softly with each breath. 

I turned to Zane, who hung back in the center of the room. “He’s really 
asleep,” I reported. 

“Let’s go back to our rooms,” Zane replied in a soft whisper. He yawned. 

I followed him to the bedroom door. “What about your cereal?” I asked. 

“Forget it. I’m too sleepy now.” 

We were nearly to the door when I heard someone move in the hall. 



“Ohhh.” I let out a low moan as a face appeared in the doorway. 
Rocky’s face. 

He had followed us upstairs! 



9 


I grabbed Zane’s arm. We both shouted cries of surprise. 

The dummy moved quickly into the room. 

I cut my cry short as I saw that he wasn’t walking on his own. He was being 
carried. 

Dad had the dummy by the back of the neck. 

“Hey—what’s going on?” Dan called sleepily from behind us. He raised his 
head from the pillow and squinted at us. “Huh? What’s everybody doing in my 
room?” 

“That’s what I’d like to know,” Dad said sharply. He gazed suspiciously 
from Zane to me. 

“You—you woke me up,” Dan murmured. He cleared his throat. Then he 
propped himself up on one elbow. “Why are you carrying that dummy, Dad?” 

“Perhaps one of you would like to answer that question,” Dad growled. He 
had pulled a robe over his pajamas. His hair was matted to his forehead. 

He wasn’t wearing his glasses, so he squinted at us. 

“What’s going on? I don’t understand,” Dan said sleepily. He rubbed his 

eyes. 

Was he putting on an act? I wondered. His innocent-little-boy act? 

“I heard noises downstairs,” Dad said, shifting Rocky to his other hand. “I 
went down to see what was going on. I found this dummy sitting at the kitchen 
table.” 

“I didn’t put him there!” Dan cried, suddenly wide awake. “Really. I 
didn’t!” 

“Neither did Zane or me!” I chimed in. 

Dad turned to me. He sighed. “I’m really sleepy. I don’t like these jokes in 
the middle of the night.” 

“But I didn’t do it!” I cried. 

Dad squinted hard at me. He really couldn’t see at all without his glasses. 
“Do I have to punish you and your brother?” he demanded. “Do I have to ground 
you? Or keep you from going away to camp this summer?” 

“No!” Dan and I both cried at once. Dan and I were both going to summer 
camp for the first time this year. It’s all we’ve talked about since Christmas. 



“Dad, I was asleep. Really,” Dan insisted. 

“No more stories,” Dad replied wearily. “The next time one of my dummies 
is somewhere he shouldn’t be, you’re both in major trouble.” 

“But, Dad—” I started. 

“One last chance,” Dad said. “I mean it. If I see Rocky out of the attic 
again, you’ve both had it!” He waved Zane and me to the door. “Get to your 
rooms. Now. Not another word.” 

“Do you believe me or not?” Dan demanded. 

“I don’t believe that Rocky has been moving around the house on his own,” 
Dad replied. “Now lie down and get back to sleep, Dan. I’m giving you one last 
chance. Don’t blow it.” 

Dad followed Zane and me into the hall. “See you in the morning,” he 
murmured. He made his way to the attic stairs to take Rocky back up to the 
Dummy Museum. I heard him muttering to himself all the way up the stairs. 

I said good night to Zane and headed to my room. I felt sleepy and upset 
and worried and confused—all at once. 

I knew that Dan had to be the one who kept springing Rocky on Zane. But 
why was he doing it? And would he quit now—before Dad grounded us or 
totally ruined our summer? 

I fell asleep, still asking myself question after question. 

The next morning, I woke up early. I pulled on jeans and a sweatshirt and 
hurried downstairs for breakfast. 

And there sat Rocky at the kitchen table. 



10 


I peered around the kitchen. No one else around. 

How lucky that I was the first one downstairs! 

I grabbed Rocky up by the back of the neck. Then I tucked him under one 
arm and dragged him up to the attic as fast as I could. 

When I returned to the kitchen a few moments later, Mom had already 
started breakfast. 

Whew! A close call. 

“Trina—you’re up early,” Mom said, filling the coffee maker with water. 
“Are you okay?” 

I glanced at the table. I had the sick feeling that Rocky would be sitting 
there sneering at me. 

But of course he was upstairs in the attic. I had just carried him up there. 

The table stood empty. 

“I’m fine,” I told her. “Just fine.” 

It was definitely Be Kind to Zane Day. After breakfast, Dad hurried off to the 
camera store. A short while later, Mom and Uncle Cal left for the mall to do 
some shopping. 

It was a bright morning. Yellow sunlight streamed in through the windows. 
The sky stretched clear and cloudless. 

Zane brought down his camera. He decided it was a perfect day to take 
some photographs. 

Dan and I expected him to go outside. But our cousin wanted to stay 
indoors and shoot. 

“I’m very interested in moldings,” he told us. 

We followed him around the house. Dan and I had made a solemn vow to 
be nice to Zane and not to scare him. 

After breakfast, when Zane was upstairs getting his camera, I grabbed my 
brother. I pinned him against the wall. “No tricks,” I told him. 

Dan tried to wriggle away. But I’m stronger than he is. I kept him pinned 
against the wall. “Raise your right hand and swear,” I instructed him. 

“Okay, okay.” He gave in easily. He raised his right hand, and he repeated 



the vow I recited. “No tricks against Zane. No making fun of Zane. No dummies 
— anywhere! ” 

I let him go as Zane returned with his camera. “You have some awesome 
moldings,” Zane said, gazing up at the living room ceiling. 

“Really?” I replied, trying to sound interested. 

What could be interesting about a molding? 

Zane tilted up his camera. He focused for what seemed like hours. Then he 
clicked a photo of the molding above the living room curtains. 

“Do you have a ladder?” he asked Dan. “Td really like to get a closer shot. 
I’m afraid my zoom lens will distort it.” 

And so Dan hurried off to the basement to get Zane a ladder. 

I was proud of my brother. He didn’t complain about having to go get the 
ladder. And he’d lasted a whole ten minutes without cracking any molding jokes 
or making fun of Zane. 

Which wasn’t easy. 

I mean, what kind of a nerd thinks it’s cool to take photos of ceilings and 
walls? 

Meanwhile, we had no school, and it was the sunniest, warmest, most 
beautiful day of March outside. Almost like spring. And Dan and I were stuck 
holding the ladder for Zane so he could use his macro lens and get a really tight 
molding shot. 

“Awesome!” Zane declared, snapping a few more. “Awesome!” 

He climbed down the ladder. He adjusted the lens. Fiddled with some other 
dials on the camera. 

“Want to go outside or something?” I suggested. 

He didn’t seem to hear me. “I’d like to get a few more banister shots,” he 
announced. “See the way the sunlight is pouring through the wooden bars? It 
makes a really interesting pattern on the wall.” 

I started to say something rude. But Dan caught my eye. He shook a finger 
at me. A warning. 

I bit my lip and didn’t say anything. 

This is sooooo boring, I thought. But at least we’re keeping out of trouble. 

We stood beside Zane as he photographed the banister from all angles. 
After about the tenth shot, his camera began to hum and whir. 

“End of the roll,” he announced. His eyes lit up. “Know what would be 
really cool? To go down into the basement to the darkroom and develop these 



right now.” 

“Cool,” I replied. I tried to sound sincere. Dan and I were both trying so 
hard to be nice to this kid! 

“Uncle Danny said I could use his darkroom downstairs,” Zane said, 
watching the camera as it rewound the film roll. “That would be awesome.” 

“Awesome,” I repeated. 

Dan and I exchanged glances. The most beautiful day of the century —and 
we were heading down to a dark closet in the basement. 

“I’ve never watched pictures get developed,” Dan told our cousin. “Can 
you show me how to do it?” 

“It’s pretty easy,” Zane replied, following us down the basement stairs. 
“Once you get the timing down.” 

We made our way through the laundry room, past the furnace, to the 
darkroom against the far wall. We slipped inside, and I clicked on the special red 
light. 

“Close the door tightly,” Zane instructed. “We can’t let in any light at all.” 

I double-checked the darkroom door. Then Zane set to work. He arranged 
the developing pans. He poured bottles of chemicals into the pans. He unspooled 
the film roll and began to develop. 

I’d watched Dad do it a hundred times before. It really was kind of 
interesting. And it was cool when the image began to appear and then darken on 
the developing paper. 

Dan and I stood close to Zane, watching him work. 

“I think I got some very good angles on the living room moldings,” Zane 
said. He dipped the large sheet of paper in one pan. Then he pulled it up, let it 
drip for a few seconds, and lowered it into the pan beside it. 

A grin spread over his face. “Let’s take a look.” 

He leaned over the table. Raised the sheet of paper. Held it up to the red 

light. 

His grin faded quickly. “Hey—who shot this?” he demanded angrily. 

Dan and I moved closer to see the photo. 

“Who shot this?” Zane repeated. He furiously picked up another sheet from 
the developing pan. Another one. Another one. 

“How did these get on the roll?” he cried. He shoved them all toward Dan 
and me. 

Photos of Rocky. 



Close-up portraits. 

Photo after photo of the sneering dummy. 

“Who shot them? Who?” Zane demanded angrily, shoving the wet photos in 
our faces. 

“I didn’t!” Dan declared, pulling back. 

“I didn’t either!” I protested. 

But then, who did? I asked myself, staring hard at the ugly, sneering face on 
each sheet. 

Who did? 



11 


“What’s going on up here, guys?” 

The dummies stared back at me blankly. None of them replied. 

“What’s the story?” I demanded. My eyes moved from one dummy to the 
next. “Come on, guys. Speak up or I’ll come back here with a buzz saw and give 
you all haircuts!” 

Silence. 

I paced back and forth in front of them, gazing at them sternly, my arms 
crossed in front of my chest. 

It was late in the afternoon. The sun had begun to lower itself behind the 
trees. Orange light washed in through the dusty attic windows. 

I had crept up to the attic to search for clues. Something weird was going 
on. 

How did all those photos of Rocky get onto Zane’s roll of film? Who took 
those photos? 

The same person who kept carrying Rocky downstairs and sitting him 
where he would frighten Zane. 

“It was Dan—right, guys?” I asked the wide-eyed dummies. “Dan came up 
here—right?” 

I searched the floor. The couch. Under all the chairs. 

I didn’t find a single clue. 

Now I was questioning the dummies. But of course they weren’t being very 
helpful. 

Stop wasting time and get back downstairs, I told myself. 

I turned and started to the stairs—when I heard soft laughter. 

“Huh?” I uttered a startled cry and spun around. 

Another quiet laugh. A snicker. 

And then a hoarse voice: “Is your hair red? Or are you starting to rust? ,, 

“Excuse me?” I cried, raising a hand to my mouth. My eyes swept quickly 
from dummy to dummy. 

Who said that? 

“Hey, Trina... you’re pretty. Pretty ugly!” That was followed by another 



soft snicker. Evil laughter. 

“I like your perfume. What is it... flea and tick spray?” 

My eyes stopped on the new dummy, the one Dad called Smiley. He sat 
straight up in the center of the couch. The voice seemed to be coming from him. 
“Pinch me. I’m having a nightmare. Or is that really your face?” 

I froze. A cold shiver ran down my back. 

The hoarse voice did come from the new dummy! 

He stared blankly at me. His mouth hung open in a stiff, unpleasant grin. 

But the voice came from Smiley. The rude insults came from Smiley. 

But that’s impossible! I told myself. 

Impossible! 

Ventriloquist’s dummies can’t talk without a ventriloquist. 

“Th-this is crazy!” I stammered out loud. 

And then the dummy started to move. 



12 


I let out a scream. 

Dan popped up from behind the couch. 

The dummy toppled onto its side. 

“You-you-you—!” I sputtered, pointing furiously at my brother. 

My heart was pounding. I felt cold all over. “That’s not funny! You—you 
scared me to death!” I shrieked. 

To my surprise, Dan didn’t laugh. His eyes were narrowed. His mouth hung 
open. “Who was making those jokes?” he demanded. His eyes darted from 
dummy to dummy. 

“Give me a break!” I shot back. “Are you going to tell me it wasn’t you?” 

He scratched his short brown hair. “I didn’t say a word.” 

“Dan, you’re the biggest liar!” I cried. “How long have you been up here? 
What are you doing here? You were spying on me—right?” 

He shook his head and stepped out from behind the couch. “What are you 
doing up here, Trina?” he asked. “Did you come up to get Rocky? To take Rocky 
downstairs again and try to scare Zane?” 

I let out an angry growl and shoved Dan with all my might. 

He stumbled backwards and fell onto the couch. He cried out as he landed 
on top of the new dummy. He and the dummy appeared to wrestle for a moment 
as Dan struggled to climb to his feet. 

I stepped up close to the couch and blocked his way. As he tried to get up, I 
pushed him back down. 

“You know I’m not the one who’s been moving Rocky around,” I shouted. 
“We all know you’ve been doing it, Dan. And you’re going to get the two of us 
in real trouble with Dad.” 

“You’re wrong!” Dan declared angrily. His little mouse face turned bright 
red. “Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!” 

He burst up from the couch. The dummy bounced on the cushion. Its head 
turned. It appeared to grin up at me. 

I turned to my brother. “If you weren’t planning more trouble, what were 
you doing up here?” 

“Waiting,” he replied. 



“Excuse me? Waiting for whom?” I demanded, crossing my arms over my 
chest. 

“Just waiting,” he insisted. “Don’t you get it, Trina?” 

I kicked at a ball of dust on the floor. It stuck to the toe of my sneaker. “Get 
it? Get what?” 

“Don’t you see what’s going on?” Dan demanded. “Haven’t you caught on 

yet?” 

I bent down and pulled the dust ball off my sneaker. Now it stuck to my 
fingers. “What is in your little mouse brain?” I asked. I rolled my eyes. “This 
should be good.” 

My brother stepped up beside me. He lowered his voice to a whisper. “Zane 
is doing it all,” he said. 

I laughed. I wasn’t sure I’d heard him. 

“No. Really.” He grabbed my arm. “I know I’m right, Trina. Zane is doing 
everything. Zane is moving the dummy, bringing it downstairs, then pretending 
to be scared. Zane made it slap him. Zane carried it to the kitchen table both of 
those times.” 

I shoved Dan’s hand off my arm. Then I spread my hand over his forehead 
and pretended to check his temperature. “You are totally losing it,” I told him. 
“Go lie down. I’ll tell Mom you’re running a high fever.” 

“Listen to me!” Dan screeched. “I’m serious! I’m right. I know I’m right!” 

“Why?” I demanded. “Why would Zane do that, Dan? Why would he scare 
himself?” 

“To pay us back for last time,” Dan replied. “Don’t you get it? Zane is 
trying to get us in trouble.” 

I dropped down onto the couch beside Smiley. I thought hard about what 
my brother was saying. “You mean Zane wants Dad to think that you and I are 
using the dummies to scare Zane.” 

“Yes!” Dan cried. “But Zane is doing it all. He’s scaring himself. And 
making it look as if we’re doing it—to get us in big trouble.” 

I fiddled with the dummy’s hand as I thought about it some more. “Zane 
scare himself? I don’t think so,” I replied finally. “What gave you this idea? 
What proof do you have?” 

Dan dropped down on the couch arm. “First of all,” he started, “you didn’t 
carry Rocky downstairs all those times, did you?” 

I shook my head. “No way.” 



“Well, neither did I,” Dan declared. “So who does that leave? Rocky isn’t 
walking around by himself—right?” 

“Of course not. But—” 

“It was the camera that gave it away,” Dan said. “The photos Zane 
developed of Rocky were the biggest clue.” 

I let the dummy hand fall to the couch. “What do you mean?” I asked. I 
really wasn’t following my brother’s thinking at all. 

“That camera is never out of Zane’s sight,” Dan replied. “Most of the time, 
he keeps it around his neck. So who else could have snapped all those photos of 
Rocky?” 

I swallowed hard. “You mean that Zane—?” 

Dan nodded. “Zane was the only one who could have taken those pictures 
of Rocky. He sneaked up to the attic. He snapped them. Then he acted scared 
and angry when he developed them.” 

“But it was all an act?” I asked. 

“For sure,” Dan replied. “It’s all been an act. To scare us. And to get us in 
trouble with Dad. Zane is trying to pay us back for how we scared him last 
time.” 

I still had my doubts. “It isn’t like Zane,” I argued. “He’s so wimpy, so 
quiet and shy. He’s not the kind of boy who plays tricks on people.” 

“He’s had months to plan it!” Dan exclaimed. “Months to plan his revenge. 
We can prove it, Trina. We can hide up here and wait for him. That’s why I was 
up here. Hiding behind the couch.” 

“To catch him in the act?” 

Dan nodded. He whispered even though we were alone. “After everyone 
goes to bed tonight, let’s sneak up here and wait. Wait and see if Zane comes.” 

“Okay,” I agreed. “It’s worth a try... I guess.” 

Was Dan right? 

Would we catch Zane in the act? 

I couldn’t wait for everyone to go to sleep. I was dying to find out. 



13 


Gusts of wind rattled the attic windowpanes. Heavy clouds covered the moon. 

We crept up the attic stairs into the darkness. Up a step. Then stop. Up a 
step. Then stop. Trying to be silent. 

The old house moaned and groaned beneath us. 

The attic stretched blacker than the stairway. 

I reached for the light switch. But Dan slapped my hand away. “Are you 
crazy?” he whispered. “It has to be dark. Totally dark. Or else Zane will know 
that someone is up here.” 

“I know that,” I whispered sleepily. “I just wanted to take one look at the 
dummies. You know. Make sure they’re all here.” 

“They’re all here,” Dan replied impatiently. “Just keep moving. We’ll hide 
behind the couch.” 

We crept on tiptoe over the attic floorboards. I couldn’t see a thing. The 
heavy clouds kept any light from washing in through the windows. 

Finally, my eyes adjusted to the darkness. I could see the arms of the couch. 
I saw dummy heads. Dummy shoulders. Shadows against shadows. 

“Dan—where are you?” I whispered. 

“Back here. Hurry.” His whisper came from behind the couch. 

I could feel the dummy eyes on me as I made my way around the couch. I 
thought I heard a soft snicker. The evil laughter again. 

But that had to be my imagination. 

I trailed my hand over the couch arm. Felt a wooden dummy hand resting 
on the arm. The dummy hand felt surprisingly warm. 

Humanly warm. 

Don’t start imagining things, Trina, I scolded myself. 

That dummy hand is warm because it’s hot up in this attic. 

The wind rattled the glass. Strong gusts roared against the roof, so low over 
our heads. 

I heard a loud groan. A soft chuckle. A strange whistling sound. 

Ignoring all the attic noises, I ducked down on the floor beside my brother. 
“Well? Here we are,” I whispered. “Now what?” 



“Sssshhhh.” In the darkness, I could see him raise a finger to his lips. “Now 
we wait. And listen.” 

We both turned and rested our backs against the back of the couch. I raised 
my knees and wrapped my arms around them. 

“He isn’t coming,” I whispered. “This is a waste of time.” 

“Ssshhh. Just wait, Trina,” Dan scolded. “Give him time.” 

I yawned. I felt so sleepy. The heat of the attic was making me even 
sleepier. 

I shut my eyes and thought about Zane. 

At dinner, he couldn’t wait to pass around the photographs of Rocky. “I 
don’t know who took these shots,” Zane complained to my dad. “But they 
wasted half a roll of film.” 

Dad glared angrily at Dan and me. But he didn’t make a fuss. “Can we talk 
about it after dinner?” he suggested quietly. 

“I’m kind of scared,” Zane told Dad in a trembling voice. “So many weird 
things have been happening. It’s like the dummies have lives of their own.” He 
shook his head. “Wow. I hope I don’t have nightmares tonight.” 

“Let’s not talk about the dummies now,” Mom chimed in. “Zane, tell us 
about your school. Who is your teacher this year? What are you studying?” 

“Could I have a second helping of potatoes?” Uncle Cal interrupted. He 
reached for the bowl. “They’re so good. I may have to make a pig of myself.” 

Dad took another quick glance at the close-up snapshots of Rocky. He 
flashed Dan and me another angry scowl. Then he set the photos down on the 
floor. 

After dinner, Dan and I were careful to keep as far away from Dad as we 
could. No way we wanted to hear another lecture about how we were terrifying 
our poor cousin. And how we’d be punished if we didn’t stop it at once. 

Now it was a little before midnight. And we were huddled in the dark attic. 
Listening to the swirling wind and the moans and groans of the house. Backs 
pressed against the couch. Waiting... 

I kept my eyes closed. Thinking hard. Thinking about Zane. About Rocky. 

Dan and I aren’t alone up here, I thought drowsily. There are thirteen 
wooden dummies up here with us. Thirteen pairs of eyes staring into the heavy 
darkness. Thirteen frozen grins. Except for Rocky’s sneer, of course. 

Empty, lifeless bodies... 

Heavy, wooden heads and hands... 



Thinking about the dummies, the dummies all around, I guess I drifted off 
to sleep. 

Did I dream about the dummies? 

Maybe I did. 

I don’t know how long I slept. 

I was awakened by footsteps. Soft, shuffling footsteps across the attic floor. 
And I knew the dummies had come alive. 



14 


I jerked my head up, listening hard. 

My hands were still wrapped around my knees. Both hands had fallen 
asleep. They tingled. The back of my neck ached. My mouth felt dry and sour. 

I uttered a silent gasp as I heard the shuffling, scraping footsteps move 
closer. 

Not dummies walking around, I realized. 

A single figure. One. One person. Moving slowly, carefully toward the 
couch. 

Why did I think I heard dummies moving? It must have been a picture left 
over from my dream. 

I shook my hands, trying to make them stop tingling. 

I was wide awake now. Totally alert. 

The footsteps scraped closer. 

Could it be Dan? Where was Dan? 

Had he climbed up while I slept? Was he making his way back to the 
couch? 

No. 

Squinting into the darkness, I saw Dan beside me. 

He had climbed to his knees. He saw me move. He waved his hand and 
signaled for me to be silent. 

Dan gripped the back of the couch with both hands. Then he leaned forward 
and peered out into the room. 

I crawled to the other end of the couch. Then, keeping low, I poked my 
head out and squinted into the deep shadows. All grays and blacks. 

The wind howled around the house. Across the big attic room, the 
windowpanes rattled and shook. 

I wanted to jump out. To scream and jump out. And flash on the light. 

But I felt Dan’s hand on my arm. He must have read my thoughts. He raised 
a finger to his lips. 

We both waited. Frozen there behind the couch. Crouching low. Listening 
to each footstep. Each creak of the floorboards. 



The dark figure stopped in front of the folding chair next to the couch. He 
stood inches from Dan and me. If I wanted to, I could reach out and grab his leg. 

I struggled to see his face. But it was hidden by the couch. And I didn’t dare 
raise myself up higher. 

I heard the clonk of wood against wood. Two dummy hands hitting each 
other. 

I heard the rustle of heavy cloth. The thud of leather shoes bumping each 
other. 

The intruder had picked up a dummy off the chair. 

Squinting into the deep blackness, I could see him swing the dummy over 
his shoulder. I could see the dummy arms swaying, swaying at his back. 

The dark figure turned away quickly. And began walking to the attic stairs. 

I crept out from behind the couch. Moving on tiptoe, I began to follow the 
intruder. 

Pressed against the wall, tiptoeing as silently as I could, I moved across the 
room. I held my breath. I could hear Dan close behind me. 

I reached the light switch just as the intruder made it to the stairs. 

My hand fumbled against the wall as I reached. 

Reached... reached for the light switch with a trembling hand. 

Yes! 

I flicked on the light. And Dan and I both shrieked at the same time. 



15 


“Zane!” 

My brother and I both screamed his name. 

Zane’s eyes bulged. His mouth opened in a high, frightened wail. 

I saw his knees bend. I think he nearly crumpled to the floor. 

He uttered several squeaks. Then his mouth hung open. I could see he was 
gasping for breath. 

“Zane—we caught you!” I managed to choke out. 

He had Rocky draped over his shoulder. 

“What—what—?” Zane struggled to speak, but no words came out. He 
sputtered and started to choke. The sneering dummy bounced on his shoulder. 

“Zane—we figured it out,” Dan told him. “Your little tricks aren’t going to 
work.” 

Our cousin was still sputtering and coughing. 

“We know it’s been you all along,” Dan told him. 

He stepped over and slapped Zane hard on the back a few times. 

After a few seconds, Zane stopped sputtering. 

Dan picked Rocky up off Zane’s shoulder and started to carry him back to 
his chair. 

“How-how-how did you know?” Zane stammered. 

“We just figured it out,” I told him. “What’s the big idea, anyway?” 

Zane shrugged. He lowered his eyes to the floor. “You know. Just having 
some fun.” 

I glared at him. “Some fun?” I cried angrily. “You tried to get us in huge 
trouble. You—you could have ruined our whole summer!” 

Zane shrugged again. “It was kind of my turn. You know?” 

“Well, we’re even now,” Dan chimed in. 

“Right,” I agreed quickly. “We’re all even now—right, Zane?” 

He nodded. “Yeah. I guess.” A grin spread slowly over his face. “I had you 
guys going, didn’t I? With that stupid dummy popping up everywhere you 
looked.” 

Dan and I didn’t grin back. 



“You fooled us,” I murmured. 

“You fooled everyone,” my brother added. 

Zane grinned. A gleeful grin. I could see how pleased he was with himself. 
“I guess Dan and I deserved it,” I confessed. 

“Guess you did,” Zane shot back. Would he ever stop grinning? 

“So now that we’re even, do we have a truce?” I demanded. “No more 
joking around with the dummies? No more trying to scare each other or get 
anyone in trouble?” 

Zane bit his lower lip. He thought about it a long, long time. “Okay. Truce,” 
he said finally. 

We all shook hands solemnly. Then we slapped each other high fives. Then 
the three of us started laughing. I’m not sure why. The laughter just burst out of 
us. 

Crazy giggling. 

I guess because it was so late and we were so sleepy. And we were so glad 
we could be friends now. We didn’t have to play tricks on each other anymore. 

As we made our way down the stairs, I felt really happy. 

I thought all the scary stuff with the dummies was over. 

I had no way of knowing that it was just beginning. 



16 


The next morning, Dan, Zane, and I went for a long bike ride. The strong winds 
had faded away during the night. A soft breeze, warm and fresh-smelling, 
followed us as we pedaled along the path. 

The trees were still winter bare. The ground glistened with a silvery 
morning frost. But the sweet, warm air told me that spring was on its way. 

We hiked slowly, following a dirt path that curved into the woods. The sun, 
still low in the sky, warmed our faces. I stopped to unzip my jacket. And pointed 
to a patch of green daffodil leaves just beginning to poke up from the ground. 

“Only three more months of school!” Dan cried. He raised both fists in the 
air and let out a cheer. 

“We’re going to camp this summer for the first time,” I told Zane. “Up in 
Massachusetts.” 

“For eight weeks!” Dan added happily. 

Zane brushed back his blond hair. He leaned over the handlebars of my 
dad’s bike and began pedaling harder. “I don’t know what I’m doing this 
summer,” he said. “Probably just hanging out.” 

“What do you want to do this summer?” I asked him. 

He grinned at me. “Just hang out.” 

We all laughed. I was in a great mood and so were the guys. 

Dan kept pulling wheelies, leaning way back and raising his front tire off 
the ground. Zane tried to do it—and crashed into a tree. 

He went sailing to the ground, and the bike fell on top of him. I expected 
him to whine and complain. That’s his usual style. But he picked himself up, 
muttering, “Smooth move, Zane.” 

“I want to see that one again!” Dan joked. 

Zane laughed. “You try it!” 

He brushed the dirt off his jeans and climbed back onto the bike. We 
pedaled on down the path, joking and laughing. 

I think we were in such great moods because of the truce. We could finally 
relax and not worry about who was trying to terrify who. 

The dirt path ended at a small, round pond. The pond gleamed in the 
sunlight, still half-frozen from the long winter. 



Zane climbed off his bike and rested it on the tall grass. Then he stepped up 
to the edge of the pond to take photos. 

“Look at the weeds poking up from the melting ice!” he exclaimed, clicking 
away. “Awesome. Awesome!” He knelt down low and snapped a bunch of weed 
photos. 

Dan and I exchanged glances. I couldn’t see what was so special about the 
weeds. But I guess that’s why I’m not a photographer. 

As Zane stood up, a tiny brown-and-black chipmunk scampered along the 
edge of the pond. Zane swung his camera and clicked off a couple of shots. 

“Hey! I think I got him!” he declared happily. 

“Great!” I cried. Everything seemed great this morning. 

We hung out at the pond for a while. We took a short walk through the 
woods. Then we started to get hungry for lunch. So we rode back to the house. 

We were about to return the bikes to the garage when Zane spotted the old 
well at the back of our yard. “Cool!” he cried, his blue eyes lighting up. “Let’s 
check it out!” 

Holding his camera in one hand, he hopped off his bike and went running 
across the grass to the well. 

It’s a round, stone well with green moss covering the smooth gray stones. It 
used to have a pointed red roof over it. But the roof blew off during a bad storm, 
and Dad hauled it away. 

When we were little, Dan and I used to scare each other by pretending that 
monsters and trolls lived down inside it. But we hadn’t paid much attention to 
the old well in years. Dad kept saying he was going to tear it down and cover it 
up. But he never got around to it. 

Zane clicked a bunch of photos. “Is there still water down there?” he asked. 

I shrugged. “I don’t know.” 

Dan grabbed Zane around the waist. “We could toss you down and see if 
you make a splash!” he declared. 

Zane wrestled himself out of my brother’s grasp. “I’ve got a better idea.” 
He picked up a stone and dropped it down the well. 

After a long wait, we heard a splash far down below. 

“Cool!” Zane exclaimed. He took several more pictures until he had 
finished the roll. 

Then we made our way inside the house for lunch. We hurried upstairs to 
clean up. 



Zane stopped at the doorway to his room. 

I saw his eyes bulge and his mouth drop open. I saw his face go white. 
Dan and I ran up next to him. 

We stared into the bedroom—and cried out in horror. 



17 


“The r-room—it’s been trashed /” Dan stammered. 

The three of us huddled in the doorway, staring into the bedroom. Staring at 
an unbelievable mess. 

At first I thought maybe Zane had left the windows open all night, and the 
strong winds had blown everything around. 

But that didn’t make any sense. 

All of the clothes had been pulled out of the closet and tossed over the floor. 
The dresser drawers had all been pulled out and dumped over the carpet. 

The bookshelves had been emptied. Books littered the floor, the bed—they 
were tossed everywhere. One bed table was turned on its side. The other stood 
upside down on top of the bed. A lamp lay on the floor in front of the closet. Its 
shade was ripped and broken. 

“Look—!” Zane pointed into the center of the room. 

Sitting on a tangled hill of clothes was Rocky. The dummy sat straight up, 
his legs crossed casually in front of him. He sneered at us as if daring us to enter. 

“I-I really don’t believe this!” I cried, tugging at the sides of my hair. 

“What don’t you believe?” 

Mom’s voice made me jump. 

I turned to see her coming out of her bedroom. She tucked her blue sweater 
into her jeans as she walked toward us. 

“Mom—!” I cried. “Something terrible has happened!” 

Her smile faded. “What on earth—?” she started. 

I stepped aside so she could see into Zane’s room. 

“Oh, no!” Mom cried out and raised both hands to her cheeks. She 
swallowed hard. “Did someone break in?” Her voice sounded tiny and 
frightened. 

I peered quickly into my room across the hall. “No. I don’t think so,” I 
reported. “This is the only room that’s messed up.” 

“But—but—” Mom sputtered. Then her eyes stopped on Rocky on top of 
the pile of clothes. “What is he doing down here?” Mom demanded. 

“We don’t know,” I told her. 

“But who did this?” Mom cried, still pressing her hands against her cheeks. 



“We didn’t!” Dan declared. 

“We’ve been outside all morning,” Zane added breathlessly. “It wasn’t 
Trina, or Dan, or me. We weren’t home. We were riding bikes.” 

“But—someone had to do this!” Mom declared. “Someone deliberately tore 
this room apart.” 

But who was it? I wondered. My eyes darted around the mess, landing on 
the sneering dummy. 

Who was it? 



18 


We all pitched in and helped get the room back together. It took the rest of the 
afternoon. 

The lamp in front of the closet was broken. Everything else just had to be 
picked up and put back where it belonged. 

We worked in silence. None of us knew what to say. 

At first, Mom wanted to call the police. But there was no sign that someone 
had broken into the house. All the other rooms were perfectly okay. 

Dad returned home from the camera shop while we were still cleaning up. 
He, of course, was furious. “What do I have to do? Bolt the attic door?” he 
shouted at Dan and me. 

He grabbed up Rocky and slung the dummy over his shoulder. “This isn’t a 
joke anymore,” Dad said, narrowing his eyes at both of us. “This isn’t funny. 
This is serious.” 

“But we didn’t do it!” I protested for the hundredth time. 

“Well, the dummy didn’t do it,” Dad shot back. “That’s one thing I know 
for sure.” 

I don’t know anything for sure, I thought. I stared at Rocky’s sneering face 
as Dad started down the hall to the attic stairs. Then I bent down to pick up the 
broken lamp from the floor. 

That night I dreamed once again about ventriloquist’s dummies. 

I saw them dancing. A dozen of them. All of Dad’s dummies from upstairs. 

I saw them dancing in Zane’s room. Dancing over the tangled piles of 
clothes and books. Dancing over the bed. Over the toppled bed table. 

I saw Rocky dancing with Miss Lucy. I saw Wilbur doing a frantic, crazy 
dance on top of the dresser. And I saw Smiley, the new dummy, clapping his 
wooden hands, bobbing his head, grinning, grinning from the middle of the room 
as the other dummies danced around him. 

They waved their big hands over their heads. Their skinny legs twisted and 

bent. 

They danced in silence. No music. No sound at all. 

And as their bodies twisted and swayed, their faces remained frozen. They 



grinned at one another with blank, unblinking eyes. Grinned their frightening, 
red-lipped grins. 

Bobbed and bent, tilted and swayed, grinning, grinning, grinning the whole 
time in the eerie silence. 

And then the grins faded as I pulled myself out of the dream. 

I opened my eyes. Slowly woke up. 

Felt the heavy hands on my neck. 

Stared up into Rocky’s ugly face. 

Rocky on top of me. The dummy on top of my blanket. Over me. 

Reaching. Reaching his heavy wooden hands for my throat! 



19 


I opened my mouth in a shrill scream of horror. 

My hands shot out. I grabbed the dummy’s hands. 

I thrashed my legs. Kicked off the blanket. Kicked at the dummy. 

The big eyes stared at me as if startled. 

I grabbed his head. Shoved him down. 

I sat up, my entire body trembling. Then I grabbed the dummy’s waist. 

And flung him to the floor. 

The ceiling light flashed on. Mom and Dad burst into my room together. 

“What’s happening?” 

“Trina—what’s wrong?” 

They both stopped short when they saw the dummy sprawled on the floor 
beside my bed. 

“He—he—” I gasped, pointing down at Rocky. I struggled to catch my 
breath. “Rocky—he jumped on me. He tried to choke me. I-I woke up and—” 

Dad let out a loud growl and tore at his hair. “This has got to stop!” he 
bellowed. 

Mom dropped down beside me on the bed and wrapped me in a hug. I 
couldn’t stop my shoulders from trembling. 

“It was so scary!” I choked out. “I woke up—and there he was!” 

“This is out of control!” Dad screamed, shaking his fist in the air. “Out of 
control!” 

Mom calmed me down. Then she and I both had to calm Dad down. 

Finally, after everyone was calm, they turned out the light and made their 
way out of the room. They closed the door. I heard Dad carrying Rocky back up 
to the attic. 

Maybe Dad should get a lock for the attic door, I thought. 

I shut my eyes and tried not to think about Rocky, or Zane, or the dummies 
—or anything at all. 

After a while, I must have drifted back to sleep. 

I don’t know how much time passed. 

I was awakened by a knock on the door. Two sharp knocks and then two 



more. 

I sat straight up with a gasp. 

I knew that Rocky had come back. 



20 


The bedroom door creaked open slowly. 

I took a deep breath and held it, staring through the dark. 

“Trina—?” a voice whispered. “Trina—are you awake?” 

As the door opened, a rectangle of gray light spilled into the room from the 
hallway. Dan poked his head in, then took a few steps across the floor. 

“Trina? It’s me.” 

I let out my breath in a long whoosh. “Dan—what do you want?” My voice 
was hoarse from sleep. 

“I heard everything,” Dan said, stepping up beside the bed. He pulled down 
one pajama sleeve. Then he raised his eyes to me. “Zane put Rocky on your bed. 
Zane did it!” Dan whispered. 

“Huh? Why do you say that? We all have a truce—remember? Zane agreed 
the tricks were all over.” 

“Right,” Dan whispered. “And now Zane thinks he can really scare us. 
Because we don’t suspect him any longer. Zane hasn’t given up, Trina. I’m sure 
of it.” 

I bit my lower lip. I tried to think about what Dan was saying. But I was so 
sleepy! 

Dan leaned close and whispered excitedly. “This morning before we went 
biking, Zane went up to his room—remember? He said he forgot his camera. 
So... he had time to mess up his room. Before he left the house.” 

“Yeah. Maybe,” I murmured. 

“And tonight he brought Rocky down and set him up on your bed. I’m sure 
of it,” Dan insisted. “I’m sure it’s Zane. We have to hide up in the attic again. 
Tomorrow night. We’ll catch Zane again. I know we will.” 

“Hide up there again? No way!” I cried. “It’s hot up there. And too creepy. 
And I’m staying as far away from those dummies as I can.” 

My brother sighed. “I know I’m right,” he whispered. 

“I don’t know what I know,” I replied. “I don’t know anything about 
anything.” I slid under the covers, pulled the blanket over my head, and tried to 
get back to sleep. 



The next night, Mom and Dad had a dinner party in honor of Zane and Uncle 
Cal. They invited the Birches and the Canfields from down the street, and 
Cousin Robin and her husband Fred. 

Fred is a great guy. Everyone calls him Froggy because he can puff out his 
cheeks like a frog. Froggy is short and very round and really looks like a frog. 

He always makes me laugh. He knows a million great jokes. Robin is 
always trying to get him to shut up. But he never does. 

Mom and Dad don’t have many dinner parties. So they had to work all day 
to get the dining room ready. To set the table. And to cook the dinner. 

Mom made a leg of lamb. Dad cooked up his specialty—Caribbean-style 
scalloped potatoes. Very spicy. 

Mom bought flowers for the table. She and Dad brought out all the fancy 
plates and glasses that we usually see only on holidays. 

The dining room really looked awesome as we all sat down to dinner. Dan, 
Zane, and I were down at the far end of the table. Froggy sat at our end. I guess, 
because he’s just a big kid. 

Froggy told me a moron joke. Someone asks a moron: “Can you stand on 
your head?” And the moron says, “No, I can’t. It’s up too high.” 

I started to laugh when I saw Zane jump up from the table. “Where are you 
going?” I called after him. 

Zane turned back at the dining room doorway. “To get my camera,” he 
replied. “I want to take some pictures of the table before it gets all messed up.” 

He disappeared upstairs. 

A few seconds later, we all heard him scream. 

Chairs scraped the floor as everyone jumped up. We all went running up the 
stairs. 

I reached Zane’s room first. From the doorway, I saw him standing in the 
center of the room. 

I saw the sick look on Zane’s face. 

And then I saw the camera in his hand. 

Or what was left of the camera. 

It looked as if it had been run over by a truck. The film door had been 
twisted off and lay on the floor. The lens was smashed. The whole camera body 
was bent and broken. 

Zane turned the camera over in his hands, gazing down at it sadly, shaking 



his head. 

I raised my eyes to the bed. And saw Rocky sitting on the bedspread. A roll 
of gray film unspooled across his lap. 

Dad burst into the room. All of our other guests pushed in after him. 

“What happened?” someone asked. 

“Is that Zane’s camera?” 

“What’s going on?” 

“That’s what happens when you try to take my picture!” Froggy joked. 

No one laughed. It wasn’t funny. 

Dad’s face turned dark red as he took the camera from Zane’s hand. Dad 
examined it carefully. His expression remained grim. 

“This isn’t mischief anymore,” he murmured. I could barely hear him over 
all the other voices in the room. Everyone had begun talking at once. 

“This cannot be allowed,” Dad said solemnly. He raised his eyes to Dan, 
then me. He stared at us both for the longest time without saying anything. 

Zane let out a long sigh. I turned and saw that he was about to cry. 

“Zane—” I started. 

But he uttered an angry shout. Then he pushed past Froggy and Mr. and 
Mrs. Birch. And went running from the room. 

“Someone here has done a very sick thing,” Dad said sadly. He raised the 
camera to his face, running a finger over the broken lens. “This is a very 
expensive camera. It was Zane’s most prized possession.” 

All of our guests became very quiet. 

Dad kept his eyes on Dan and me. He started to say something else. 

But then we all heard the deafening crash from downstairs. 



21 


“What is going on here?” Dad cried. He tossed the broken camera onto the bed 
and darted from the room. 

The others went hurrying after him. All talking at once. I heard their shoes 
pounding down the stairs. 

I turned to Dan. “Still think Zane is doing these things?” 

Dan shrugged. “Maybe.” 

“No way,” I told him. “No way Zane is going to smash his own camera. He 
loved his camera. No way he would smash it just to get you and me in trouble.” 

Dan raised troubled eyes to me. “Then I don’t get it,” he said in a tiny 
voice. I could see the fear on his face. 

I heard startled shouts and cries of alarm from downstairs. “Let’s check out 
the next disaster,” I said, rolling my eyes. 

We reached the bedroom door at the same time and squeezed through 
together. Then I led the way along the hall and down the stairs. 

I fought back my own fear as we approached the dining room. 

Something very strange was going on in this house, I knew. Dad was right 
when he said it was no joke. 

Tearing Zane’s room apart wasn’t a joke. It was evil. 

Wrecking Zane’s camera was evil, too. 

Thinking about Rocky gave me a chill. The dummy was always there. 
Whenever something evil happened, there sat Rocky. 

Trina, don’t be crazy! I scolded myself. Don’t start thinking that a wooden 
ventriloquist’s dummy can be evil. 

That’s crazy thinking. That’s really messed up. 

But what could I think? 

My throat tightened. My mouth suddenly felt very dry. 

I took a deep breath and led the way into the dining room. 

I saw Dad in the kitchen doorway. He had his arm around Mom’s shoulders. 
Mom had her head buried against Dad’s shirtsleeve. 

Was she crying? 

Yes. 



The guests all stood against the wall, shaking their heads, their expressions 
grim and confused. They muttered quietly, staring at the disaster. 

The disaster. The terrible disaster. 

The dining room table. 

I saw the overturned platters first. Dad’s scalloped potatoes smeared over 
the tablecloth. Clumps of potatoes stuck to the wall and the front of the china 
hutch. 

The salad poured over the floor and the chairs. The bread ripped into small 
chunks, the chunks tossed over the table. The flowers ripped off their stems. The 
vase on its side, water pouring over the tablecloth, puddling on the floor. 

The glasses all turned over. A bottle of red wine tipped over, a dark red 
stain spreading over the tablecloth. 

I heard Mom’s sobs. I heard the sounds of Dad’s muttered attempts to calm 
her down. I saw the other guests shaking their heads, their faces so upset, so 
concerned, so puzzled. 

And then Dan grabbed my shoulder and pointed me toward the head of the 
table. And I saw two dummies sitting there on dining room chairs. 

Wilbur and the new dummy. Wilbur and Smiley. 

They sat at the table, grinning at each other, wine glasses in their hands. As 
if celebrating. As if toasting each other. 



22 


That night, Dan and I hid behind the couch in the attic once again. The attic 
stretched dark and silent. So dark, I could barely see my brother sitting beside 
me. 

We were both in pajamas. The air was hot and dry. But my hands and my 
bare feet felt cold and clammy. 

We talked softly, our legs stretched out on the floor, resting against the back 
of the couch. As we talked, we waited—and listened. Listened to every sound. 

It was nearly midnight, but I didn’t feel sleepy. I felt alert. Ready for 
anything. 

Ready to catch Zane in the act once again. 

This time, I brought my little flash camera with me. When Zane crept up 
here to carry one of the dummies downstairs, I’d snap his photo. Then I’d have 
proof to show Mom and Dad. 

Yes, I finally decided that Dan was right. Zane had to be the one who was 
destroying our house. 

Destroying our house and trying to scare everyone into thinking the 
dummies had come to life. 

“But why?” I whispered to Dan. “Did we scare Zane so badly the last time 
he was here? So badly that he’ll do anything to pay us back?” 

“He’s sick,” Dan muttered. “That’s the only answer. He’s totally messed 

up.” 

“So messed up that he wrecked his own camera,” I murmured, shaking my 
head. 

“So messed up that he ran downstairs and trashed the dining room,” Dan 
added. 

The dining room. That’s what convinced me that Zane was guilty. 

All of us were upstairs in Zane’s room, examining his broken camera. 

Zane was the only other person downstairs. 

Zane was the only person in the house who could have trashed the dining 
room and wrecked the dinner. 

Of course he acted horrified and shocked. Of course he acted as if he didn’t 
have a clue about what had happened. 



What a sad, sad night. 

The dinner guests didn’t know what to say to Mom and Dad. It was such a 
frightening mystery. No one had an answer. 

The guests helped clean up the mess. The food was ruined. It couldn’t be 
eaten. No one felt like eating, anyway. 

Everyone left as soon as the dining room was cleaned and cleared. 

As the last guest left, I turned to Dan. “Uh-oh,” I whispered. “Family 
Conference Time. We’re in for a major lecture now.” 

But I was wrong. Mom hurried up to her room. And Dad said he was too 
disgusted to talk to anyone. 

Uncle Cal asked if Dad would like him to take the car and pick up some 
fried chicken or hamburgers or something. 

Dad just scowled at him and stomped away. He carried Smiley and Wilbur 
up to the attic. I heard him slam the attic door. Then he disappeared into the 
bedroom to help comfort Mom. 

Zane turned to his dad. “I-I can’t believe my good camera is smashed,” he 
whimpered. 

Uncle Cal placed a hand on Zane’s shoulder. “I’ll bet your uncle Danny has 
a new camera at his shop that he’ll want to give you.” 

“But I liked my old camera!” Zane wailed. 

And that’s when I decided he was guilty. He’s a phony, I decided. He’s 
carrying on like this—putting on a show for Dan and me. 

But I wasn’t going to fall for it. No way. 

I made sure I had film in my little camera. Then I grabbed Dan and we 
crept up to the attic to wait. To wait in the darkness and catch Zane. 

To end the disasters in our house once and for all. 

We didn’t have to wait long. 

After about half an hour, I heard the tap of soft footsteps on the attic floor. 

I sucked in my breath. My whole body tensed, and I nearly dropped the 
camera. 

Beside me, Dan raised himself to his knees. 

My heart pounding, I crept to the edge of the couch. 

Tap tap. Shuffling footsteps on the bare floorboards. 

I saw a dark figure bend down and lift a dummy off a chair. 

“It’s Zane,” I whispered to Dan. “I knew it!” 

In the heavy darkness, I could see him carrying the dummy to the stairs. 



I stood up. My legs trembled. But I moved quickly. 

I raised the camera. Stepped in front of the couch. 

Pushed the shutter button. 

The room flashed in an explosion of white light. 

I clicked off another one. 

Another bright white flash. 

And in the flash, I saw Rocky dangling over Zane’s shoulder. 

No. 

Not Zane! 

Not Zane. Not Zane. 

In the flash of light, I saw Rocky dangling over another dummy’s shoulder! 
Smiley! The new dummy. 

The new dummy was shuffling toward the stairs, carrying Rocky away. 



23 


The dummy turned. 

My hand fumbled for the light switch. I clicked on the light. 

I stood frozen in front of the couch. Too startled to move. 

“Smiley—stop!” I screamed. 

The dummy’s grin faded. The eyes narrowed at me. “I’m not Smiley,” he 
croaked. He had a hoarse, raspy voice. “My name is Slappy.” 

He turned back to the stairs. 

“Stop him!” I cried to my brother. 

We both made a dive for the dummy. 

Slappy spun around. He pulled Rocky off his shoulder—and heaved him at 

Dan. 

I grabbed Slappy around the waist and tackled him to the floor. 

He swung both hands hard. One of them slammed into my forehead. 

“Unh.” I let out a groan as the pain shot through me. 

My hands slid off the dummy’s slender waist. Slappy jumped nimbly to his 
feet, his grin wide and leering. 

He was enjoying this! 

He kicked me in the side with the toe of his big leather shoe. 

My head still throbbing, I rolled out of the way. And turned back in time to 
see Dan grab the dummy from behind. 

Dan drove his head into the dummy’s back. They both dropped hard to the 
floor. 

“Let go of me, slave!” Slappy demanded in his ugly, hoarse voice. “You are 
my slave now! Let go of me! I order you!” 

I pulled myself to my knees as Dan and Slappy wrestled over the floor. 

“He’s so... strong!” Dan called out to me. 

Slappy rolled on top of him. Started to pound him with his wooden fists. 

I grabbed Slappy by the shoulders and tugged with all my strength. Slappy 
swung his arms, thrashing at my brother. 

I pulled hard, trying to tug him off Dan’s stomach. 

“Let go! Let go!” the dummy shrieked. “Let go, slave!” 



“Get off him!” I cried. 

We were making such a racket, I didn’t hear the attic door open downstairs. 
And I didn’t hear the footsteps running up the stairs. 

A face appeared. And then a large body. 

“Dad!” I cried breathlessly. “Dad—look!” 

“What on earth—!” Dad exclaimed. 

“Dad—it’s alive! The dummy is alive!” I shrieked. 

“Huh?” Squinting through his glasses, Dad lowered his gaze to the dummy 
on the floor. 

The dummy sprawled lifelessly on its back beside Dan. One arm was 
twisted beneath its back. Both legs were bent in two. 

The mouth hung open in its painted grin. The eyes stared blankly at the 
ceiling. 

“It is alive!” Dan insisted. “It really is!” 

Dad stared down at the still, silent dummy. 

“The dummy picked up Rocky!” Dan declared in a high, excited voice. “He 
said his name was Slappy. He picked up Rocky. He was carrying him 
downstairs.” 

Dad tsk-tsked and shook his head. “Give it up, Dan,” he murmured angrily. 
“Just stop it right now.” He raised his eyes to Dan, then to me. “I knew you two 
were the troublemakers.” 

“But, Dad—” I protested. 

“I’m not an idiot,” Dad snapped, scowling at me. “You can’t expect me to 
believe a dumb story about a dummy coming to life and carrying another 
dummy around. Have you both lost your minds entirely?” 

“It’s true,” Dan insisted. 

We both gazed down at Slappy. He sure didn’t look alive. For a moment, I 
had the frightening feeling that I’d dreamed the whole scene. 

But then I remembered something. “I have proof!” I cried. “Dad, I can 
prove to you that Dan and I aren’t lying.” 

Dad rubbed the back of his neck. “I’m so tired,” he moaned. “It’s been such 
a long, horrible day. Please. Give me a break, Trina.” 

“But I took some pictures!” I told him. “I have pictures of Slappy carrying 
Rocky!” 

“Trina, I’m warning you—” Dad started. 

But I spun away, searching for my camera. Where was it? Where? 



It took me a few seconds to spot it on the floor against the wall back by the 
couch. I hurried across the room to grab it. 

And stopped halfway. 

The back of the camera—it had sprung open. The film was exposed. The 
pictures were ruined. 

The camera must have flown out of my hand when I tried to tackle Slappy, I 
realized. I picked it up and examined it sadly. 

No pictures. No proof. 

I turned back to find Dad scowling at me. “No more wasting my time, 
Trina. You two are grounded until further notice. I’m so disgusted with both of 
you. Your mother and I will think of other punishments after your cousin 
leaves.” 

Then Dad waved a hand at Slappy and Rocky. “Put them away. Right now. 
And stay out of the attic. Stay away from my dummies. That’s all I have to say 
to you. Good night.” 

Dad turned away sharply and stomped down the stairs. 

I glanced at Dan and shrugged. I didn’t know what to say. 

My heart was pounding. I was so angry. So upset. So hurt. My chest felt 
about to explode. 

I bent down to pick up Slappy. 

The dummy winked at me. 

His ugly grin grew wider. And then he puckered his red lips and made 
disgusting, wet kissing sounds. 



24 


“Don’t touch me, slave,” Slappy growled. 

I gasped and jumped back. I still couldn’t believe this was happening. I 
wrapped my arms around myself to stop my body from trembling. 

“You—you really are alive?” Dan asked softly. 

“You bet your soft head lam!” the dummy roared. 

“What do you want?” I cried. “Why are you doing this to us? Why are you 
getting us in all this trouble?” 

The ugly grin spread over his face. “If you treat me nice, slaves, maybe I 
won’t get you in any more trouble. Maybe you’ll get lucky.” He tapped his head 
and added, “Knock on wood.” 

“We’re not your slaves!” I insisted. 

He tossed back his head and let out a dry laugh. “Who’s the dummy here?” 
he cried. “You or me?” 

“You carried Rocky downstairs all those times?” Dan asked. I could see that 
my brother was having a hard time believing this, too. 

“You don’t think that bag of kindling can move on his own, do you?” 
Slappy sneered. “I had some fun with that ugly guy. I put him at the scene of the 
crimes to throw you off the track. To keep you slaves guessing.” 

“And you smashed Zane’s camera and ruined the dinner party?” I 
demanded. 

He narrowed his eyes to evil slits. “I’ll do much worse if you slaves don’t 
obey me.” 

I could feel the anger rising through my body. “You—you’re going to ruin 
everything!” I screamed at him. “You’re going to ruin our lives! You’re going to 
keep us from going to camp this summer!” 

Slappy snickered. “You won’t be going to camp. You’ll be staying home to 
take good care of me!” 

And then I exploded. 

“Nooooo!” I uttered a long wail of protest. 

I grabbed his head in both hands. I started to tug. 

I remembered his head had been split in two when Dad found him. I 
planned to pull his head apart—to split it in two again! 



He kicked his legs frantically and thrashed his arms. 

His heavy shoes kicked at my legs. 

But I held on tight. Pulling. Pulling. Struggling to pull his head apart. 

“Let me try! Let me try!” Dan called. 

I let out a sigh and dropped the dummy to the floor. “It’s no use,” I told 
Dan. “Dad did too good a job. It’s glued tight.” 

Slappy scrambled to his feet. He shook his head. “Thanks for the head 
massage, slave! Now rub my back!” He laughed, an ugly dry laugh that sounded 
more like a cough. 

Dan stared at the dummy in wide-eyed horror. “Trina—what are we going 
to do?” he cried, his voice just above a whisper. 

“How about a game of Kick the Dummy Down the Stairs?” Slappy 
suggested, leering at us. “We’ll take turns being the dummy. You can go first!” 

“We—we have to do something!” Dan stammered. “He’s a monster! He’s 
evil! We have to get rid of him!” 

But how? I wondered. 

How? 

And then I had an idea. 



25 


Slappy must have read my thoughts. He turned and started to run. 

But I dove fast—and wrapped my hands around his skinny legs. 

He let out a harsh, angry cry as I began twisting his legs around each other, 
struggling to tie them in a knot. 

He swung an arm. The wooden hand caught me on the ear. 

But I held on. 

“Dan—grab his arms! Hurry!” 

My brother moved quickly. Slappy tried to bat him away. But Dan ducked 
low. And when he came up, he grabbed Slappy’s wrists and held on. 

“Let me go, slaves!” the dummy rasped. “Let me go now. You’ll be sorry! 
You’ll pay!” 

I saw the fear on Dan’s face. 

Slappy swung a hand free. He tried to swipe at Dan’s throat. 

But Dan reached out and grabbed onto the loose arm again. 

I felt eyes on me. I glanced up to see the other dummies around the room. 
They appeared to watch us struggle. A silent, still audience. 

I pulled a red kerchief off a dummy’s neck. And I stuffed it into Slappy’s 
mouth to keep him quiet. 

“Downstairs! Hurry!” I instructed my brother. 

The dummy twisted and squirmed, trying to break free. 

But I had his legs tied around each other. And Dan kept a tight grip on his 
arms. 

We began making our way to the attic stairs. “Where are we taking him?” 
Dan demanded. 

“Outside,” I replied. The dummy bucked and squirmed. I nearly dropped 

him. 

“In our pajamas?” Dan asked. 

I nodded and began backing down the stairs. Slappy struggled hard to get 
free. I nearly lost my balance and toppled over backwards. 

“We’re not going far,” I groaned. 

Somehow we made it all the way downstairs. I had to let go with one hand 



to open the front door. Slappy bucked his knees, trying to untangle his legs. 

I pushed the door open. Grabbed the legs again. 

Dan and I carried the squirming dummy outside. 

A cold, clear night. A light, silvery frost over the grass. A half moon high 
over the trees. 

“Ohhh.” I let out a moan as my bare feet touched the frozen grass. 

“It’s c-cold!” Dan stammered. “I can’t hold on much longer.” 

I saw him shiver. The front lawn suddenly darkened as clouds rolled over 
the moon. My legs trembled. The damp cold seeped through my thin pajamas. 

“Where are we taking him?” Dan whispered. 

“Around to the back.” 

Slappy kicked hard. But I held on tightly. 

Something scampered past my bare feet. I heard scurrying footsteps over 
the frosty ground. 

A rabbit? A raccoon? 

I didn’t stop to see. Gripping Slappy’s ankles with both hands, I backed up. 
Backed along the side of the house. 

“My feet are numb!” Dan complained. 

“Almost there,” I replied. 

Slappy uttered hoarse cries beneath the kerchief that gagged his mouth. His 
round eyes rolled wildly. Again, he tried to kick free. 

Dan and I hauled him to the back of the yard. By the time we got to the old 
well, my feet were frozen numb, too. And my whole body shook from the cold. 

“What are we going to do?” Dan asked in a tiny voice. 

The clouds rolled away. Shadows pulled back. The silvery moonlight lit up 
the old stone well. 

“We’re going to toss him down the well,” I groaned. 

Dan stared at me, surprised. 

“He’s evil,” I explained. “We have no choice.” 

Dan nodded. 

We lifted Slappy onto the smooth stones at the top of the well. He bucked 
and kicked. He tried to scream through his gag. 

I saw Dan shiver again. 

“It’s a wooden dummy,” I told him. “It isn’t a person. It’s an evil wooden 
dummy.” 

We both shoved hard at the same time. 



The dummy slid off the stone wall and dropped into the well. 

Dan and I both waited until we heard the splash from far below. 

Then we ran side by side back to the house. 

He’s gone! I thought gratefully. Joyfully. The evil thing is gone for good. 

I slept really well that night. And I didn’t dream about dummies. 

The next morning, Dan and I met in the hall. We both were smiling. We felt 
so good. 

I was actually singing as I followed Dan down the stairs for breakfast. 

Dad greeted us at the kitchen door with an angry frown. “What is he doing 
down here?” Dad demanded. 

He pointed into the kitchen. 

Pointed at the breakfast table. 

Pointed to Slappy, sitting at the breakfast table, grinning his ugly painted 
grin, his eyes wide and innocent. 



26 


Dan’s mouth dropped open. 

I let out a sharp cry. 

“Don’t act stunned. Just get him out of here,” Dad said angrily. “And why is 
he all wet? Did you have him out in the rain?” 

I glanced out the kitchen window. Lightning flashed through a dark gray 
sky. Sheets of rain pounded the glass. Thunder rumbled overhead. 

“Not a very nice morning,” Uncle Cal said, stepping up behind Dan and me. 

“I’ve got coffee ready,” Dad told him. 

“I see your friend here beat us down to breakfast,” Uncle Cal said, 
motioning to Slappy. 

The dummy’s grin seemed to grow wider. 

“Get him out of here, Trina,” Dad repeated sharply. “Anyone want pancakes 
this morning?” He moved to the cabinet and started searching for a frying pan. 

“Make a few extra for me. I’m starving,” Uncle Cal said. “I’ll go see if 
Zane is up.” He turned and hurried out of the kitchen. 

Dad leaned into the cabinet, banging pots and pans, searching for the one he 
always used for pancakes. 

“Dad, I have to tell you something,” I said softly. I couldn’t hold it in any 
longer. I had to tell Dad the truth. I had to tell him the whole story. 

“Dad, Slappy is evil,” I told him. “He’s alive, and he’s evil. Dan and I threw 
him down the well last night. We had to get rid of him. But now—he’s back. You 
have to help us, Dad. We have to get rid of him—now.” 

I took a deep breath and let it out. It felt so good to get the story off my 
chest. 

Dad pulled his head from the cabinet and turned to me. “Did you say 
something, Trina? I was making such a racket, I couldn’t hear you.” 

“Dad, I-I—” I stammered. 

“Get that dummy out of here—now!” Dad shouted. He stuck his head back 
into the cabinet. “How can a whole frying pan disappear into thin air?” 

I let out a disappointed sigh. A loud burst of thunder made me jump. 

I motioned with my head for Dan to help me. We lifted Slappy off the chair. 
I held him around the waist, as far away from me as possible. 



His gray suit was sopping wet. Water dripped off his black leather shoes. 

We were halfway up the attic stairs when Slappy blinked and let out a soft 
chuckle. “Nice try, slaves,” he rasped. “But give up. I’m never going away. 
Never!” 



27 


What a dreary morning. 

Rain pounded the windows. Lightning crackled through the charcoal-gray 
sky. Thunder boomed so close it rocked the house. 

I felt as if the storm were inside my head. As if the heavy, heavy storm 
clouds were weighing me down. As if the thunder erupted inside my brain, 
drowning out my thoughts. 

Dan and I slumped on the couch in the den, watching the storm through the 
Venetian blinds over the big window. We were trying to come up with an idea, a 
way to get rid of Slappy. 

The room was chilly. Damp, cold air leaked through the old window. I 
mbbed the sleeves of my sweater, trying to warm myself. 

We were alone in the house. Mom, Dad, Uncle Cal, and Zane had gone into 
town. 

“I tried to tell Dad,” I said. “You heard me, Dan. I tried to tell him about 
Slappy. But he didn’t hear me.” 

“Dad wouldn’t believe you anyway, Trina,” Dan replied glumly. He sighed. 
“Who would believe it?” 

“How can a wooden dummy come to life?” I asked, shaking my head. 
“How?” 

And then I remembered. 

And then I had an idea. 

I jumped up from the couch. I tugged my brother by the arm. “Come on.” 

He pulled back. “Where?” 

“To the attic. I think I know how to put Slappy to sleep—for good.” 

I stopped at the attic door and held Dan back. “Be very quiet,” I instructed 
him. “Maybe Slappy is asleep. If he’s asleep, my plan will go a whole lot better.” 

Thunder roared as I opened the door. I led the way up the stairs, moving 
slowly, carefully, one step at a time. I could hear the rain pounding down on the 
roof. And I could see the flicker of lightning on the low ceiling. 

I stopped as I reached the top of the stairs and turned toward the dummy 
collection. A flash of lightning through the window cast the shadows of their 
heads on the wall. As the lightning flickered, the shadows all seemed to be 



moving. 

Dan stepped up behind me. “Here we are. Now what?” he whispered. 

I raised a finger to my lips and began to tiptoe across the floor. Thunder 
boomed. It sounded so much louder up here under the roof! 

When Dan and I dragged Slappy up here this morning, we had tossed him 
down on the floor. We were too freaked and frightened to spend the time 
propping him up on his chair. We just wanted to dump him and get away from 
the attic. 

I saw Slappy in the flickering white lightning. Lying on his back in the 
center of the floor. The other dummies sat around him, grinning their silent grins. 

I took a step closer. And then another. Moving as silently as I could. 

I peered down at the evil dummy. His arms were at his sides. His legs were 
twisted around each other. 

And his eyes were closed. 

Yes! 

His eyes were closed. He was asleep. 

I took another few steps toward Slappy. But I felt Dan’s hand on my arm, 
tugging me back. “Trina—what are you going to do?” he whispered. 

My eyes darted to Slappy. Still asleep. Thunder roared all around. It 
sounded as if we were standing in the middle of it. 

“Remember those weird words I read?” I whispered to my brother, keeping 
my eyes on the evil dummy. “Remember those weird words on that slip of 
paper?” 

Dan thought for a moment. Then he nodded. 

“Well, maybe it was those words that brought him to life,” I whispered. 
“Maybe it’s some kind of secret chant.” 

Dan shrugged. “Maybe.” He didn’t sound too hopeful. 

“I saw you tuck that slip of paper back into Slappy’s jacket pocket,” I told 
my brother. “I’m going to take it out and read the words again. Maybe the same 
words that bring him to life will also put him back to sleep.” 

Of course it was a crazy idea. 

But a dummy coming to life was crazy, too. And a dummy trying to turn 
you into his slave was crazy. 

It was all crazy. So maybe my idea was just crazy enough to work. 

“Good luck,” my brother whispered, his eyes on the sleeping dummy on the 


floor. 



I made my way over to Slappy. 

I knelt down on my knees beside him. 

I took a deep breath and held it. Then slowly, slowly, I began to reach my 
hand down to his jacket pocket. 

I knew the slip of paper was inside that pocket. Could I pull it out without 
waking up Slappy? 

I lowered my hand. Lowered it. 

My fingers touched the top of the jacket pocket. 

Still holding my breath, I began to slip two fingers inside. 

“Gotcha!” Slappy shrieked as his hands shot up. He grabbed both of my 
wrists and began to squeeze. 



28 


I was so stunned, I nearly fell on top of him. 

As I struggled to keep my balance, his wooden hands dug into my wrists. 
They tightened around me, cutting into my skin. 

“Let go of me!” I screamed. I struggled to pull my arms away. But he was 
too strong. Too strong. 

The hard fingers dug into my wrists. They squeezed harder, harder—until 
they cut off all circulation. 

“Let go of me! Let go!” My cry came out a shrill wail. 

“I give the orders, ssssslave!” Slappy hissed. “You will obey me. Obey me 
forever! Or you will pay!” 

“Let go! Let me go!” I shrieked. I tugged. I struggled to my feet. I jerked 
my arms up and down. 

But Slappy didn’t loosen his hold. 

His whole body bounced in the air. Hit the floor. Bounced back up as I 
pulled. 

But his hands gripped even harder. 

I couldn’t free myself. And the pain—the intense pain—shot down my 
arms. Down my sides. Down my whole body. 

“Pick me up, sssslave!” the dummy hissed. “Pick me up and put me on my 
chair.” 

“Let go!” I cried. “You’re breaking my wrists! Let go!” 

The dummy uttered a cold laugh in reply. 

The pain shot through my body. My legs wobbled. I dropped back to my 
knees. 

I turned in time to see Dan dive toward us. 

I thought he was going to grab the dummy’s hand and try to set me free. 

Instead, Dan grabbed for the jacket pocket. 

Slappy let go of my wrists. But not in time. 

Dan pulled the slip of paper from the pocket. 

Slappy swiped at Dan’s hand, trying to grab the paper away. 

But Dan swung around. He unfolded the paper and raised it to his face. And 



then he shouted out the mysterious words that were written there 
“Karru marri odonna loma molonu karrano. ” 

Would it work? 

Would it put Slappy back to sleep? 



29 


I rubbed my aching wrists and stared down at the grinning dummy. 

He gazed back at me. And then winked. 

His laughter roared over the thunder, over the hard, steady drumming of 
rain on the roof. 

“You cannot defeat me that way, slave!” Slappy cried gleefully. 

I took a step back. A chill ran down my back, making my whole body 
shudder. 

My plan hadn’t worked. 

My only plan. My last, desperate plan. A total failure. 

I caught the disappointment on Dan’s face. The slip of paper fell from his 
fingers and floated to the floor. 

“You will pay for this!” Slappy threatened. “You will pay for your foolish 
attempt to defeat me.” 

He pushed his hands against the floor and started to climb to his feet. 

I backed up. 

And saw the other dummies move. 

All of them. They were sliding off their chairs. Lowering themselves from 
the couch. 

They stretched their skinny arms. Flexed their big, wooden hands. 

Their heads bobbed, their knees bent as they started to shuffle toward us. 

They had all come to life! Twelve dummies, brought to life by those strange 
words Dan had cried out. 

Twelve dummies staggering toward Dan and me. 

We were trapped between them. Trapped in the circle as they shuffled, 
dragging their heavy shoes. Their eyes wide. Locked on Dan and me. 

As they staggered and shuffled. Moving stiffly, grinning, grinning so coldly. 

Closing in on Dan and me. 



30 


Wilbur limped toward us, his big, chipped hands stretched out, ready to grab us. 
Lucy’s big blue eyes gleamed coldly as she staggered toward us. Arnie let out a 
high-pitched giggle as he pulled himself closer. 

Closer. 

Dan and I spun around. But we had nowhere to turn. Nowhere to escape. 

The dummies’ big shoes scraped heavily over the wooden floorboards. 
Their knees bent with each step. They looked as if they would tumble to the 
floor. 

But they kept coming. Lurching forward. Bodies bending. Heads bobbing. 

Alive. Wooden creatures. Alive! 

Dan raised his hands over his face as if to shield himself. 

I took a step back. But the dummies behind me were closing in, too. 

I took a long, deep breath and held it. 

Then I waited. 

Waited for their wooden hands to grab us. 

I uttered a loud gasp as Wilbur and Arnie staggered right past me. 

The dummies all brushed past Dan and me. 

As if we weren’t there. 

I stared in shock as they circled Slappy. I saw Rocky grab Slappy by the 
collar. I saw Lucy grab Slappy’s shoes. 

Then the circle of dummies moved in closer. Tighter. 

I couldn’t see what they were doing to Slappy. But I saw their skinny arms 
jerking and tugging. I saw them all struggling together. 

Wrestling with him. 

Were they pulling him apart? 

I couldn’t see. But I heard Slappy’s scream of terror. 

Dan and I clung to each other, watching the strange sight. It looked like a 
football huddle. A huddle of dummies. 

The dummies grunted and groaned, muttering in low tones as they worked 
over Slappy. 

We couldn’t see Slappy in the middle. 



We heard only one scream. 

We didn’t hear him scream again. 
And then I heard the attic door open. 
Footsteps on the stairs! 

Someone was coming up. 



31 


I poked Dan and turned him to the stairs. 

We both cried out as Zane climbed up to the attic and squinted across the 
long room at us. 

Did he see the struggling dummies? Did he see that they were all alive? 

I turned back—in time to see the dummies all collapse in a heap. 

“Whoa!” I cried, my heart pounding. I blinked several times. I didn’t 
believe what I saw. 

The twelve dummies lay lifeless on the floor, arms and legs in a wild tangle. 
Mouths open. Eyes gazing up blankly at the low ceiling. 

Slappy lay sprawled in the middle. His head tilted to one side. I saw the 
blank stare in his eyes. Saw the open-mouthed, wooden grin. 

He was completely lifeless now. As lifeless as all the others. 

Had the other dummies somehow destroyed his evil? 

Would Slappy remain a lifeless block of wood forever? 

I didn’t have time to think about it. Zane came hurrying across the attic, an 
angry scowl on his face. His eyes were on the pile of dummies. 

“Caught you!” Zane cried to Dan and me. “Caught you both! Planning your 
next trick! I knew you two were the ones! I’m telling Uncle Danny what you’re 
doing!” 



32 


Of course no one believed Dan and me. 

Of course everyone believed Zane. 

We were in the worst trouble of our lives. Dan and I were grounded forever. 
We probably won’t be allowed to leave the house until we are in our forties! 

The next day, Zane and Uncle Cal were at the front door, saying good-bye. 
It’s a terrible thing to say—but Dan and I were not sad to see Zane go. 

“I hope I never have to come back here,” he whispered to me in the hall. 
Then he put on a big, phony smile for Mom and Dad. 

“Zane, what kind of camera would you like?” Dad asked, putting a hand on 
Zane’s shoulder. “You have a birthday coming up. I’d like to send you a new 
camera for your birthday.” 

Zane shrugged his big shoulders. “Thanks,” he told my Dad. “But I’m 
really not into photography anymore.” 

Mom and Dad raised their eyebrows in surprise. 

“Well, what would you like for your birthday, Zane?” Mom asked. “Is there 
something else you’re interested in?” 

Zane shyly lowered his eyes to the floor. “Well... I’d kind of like to try 
being a ventriloquist—like you, Uncle Danny.” 

Dad beamed happily. 

That creep Zane had said just the right thing. 

“Maybe you have a spare dummy you can lend Zane,” Uncle Cal suggested. 

Dad rubbed his chin. “Well... maybe I do.” He turned to me. “Trina, mn up 
to the attic. And pick out a good dummy for Zane to take home. Not one of the 
old ones. But a nice one that Zane can enjoy.” 

“No problem, Dad,” I replied eagerly. I hurried up to the attic. I hoped they 
didn’t see the enormous grin on my face. 

Can you guess which dummy I picked out for Zane? 

I know it’s horribly mean. But I really had no choice—did I? 

“Here’s a good one, Zane,” I said a few seconds later. I placed the grinning 
dummy in Zane’s arms. “His name is Slappy. I think you two will be very happy 
together.” 

I hope Zane has fun learning to be a ventriloquist. 



But I have the feeling he may have a few problems. Because as Zane 
carried Slappy into the car, I saw the dummy wink at me.

BAD HARE DAY 


Goosebumps - 41 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


“Pick a card, any card.” I spread out the deck of cards in front of Sue Mailer, 
facedown. She giggled and picked one. 

“Don’t show it to me,” I warned her. She glanced at the card, keeping it 
hidden from me. 

A small crowd of kids gathered on the school steps to watch. School was 
out for the day. Sue showed them her card. 

I love doing magic tricks—especially in front of an audience. My dream is 
to be a great magician like my idol, Amaz-O. 

I’ve been playing around with stage names. My real name is Tim Swanson 
—but that’s way too boring for a professional magician. I’ve been thinking of 
calling myself Swanz-O. My best friend, Foz, thinks Swanz-0 sounds like a 
laundry detergent. 

“Now, Sue,” I said in a louder voice, so everybody could hear me. “Put the 
card back in the deck.” 

Sue slipped the card in with the others. I shuffled the deck and tapped it 
three times. “I will now make your card rise to the top of the deck,” I announced. 

Tap, tap, tap. I picked up the top card and showed it to Sue. “Was this your 
card?” I asked her. 

Her eyebrows shot up in amazement. “The three of clubs!” she cried. “That 
was my card!” 

“How’d you do that?” Jesse Brown asked. 

“Magicians never reveal their secrets,” I said, bowing. “And now, for my 
next trick—” 

“I know how he did it.” My little sister, Ginny, suddenly popped up in the 
crowd. The sound of her scratchy voice made my hair stand on end. She loves to 
spoil my magic shows. 

But a true magician doesn’t let anything throw him. I grinned my biggest, 
fakest grin at the little brat. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, my lovely assistant, Ginny!” 

“I’m not your assistant, freak-face,” Ginny snarled. “You won’t catch me 
doing nerdy magic tricks. I’m into karate. Hi-ya!” She demonstrated her karate 
chop. 



Some of the kids laughed. I pretended to laugh, too. “Ha, ha. Isn’t she a 
riot?” 

Everybody says Ginny looks like an angel. She has long, wavy blond hair, 
rosy cheeks, big blue eyes. People always ooh and aah over her. 

No one ever oohs and aahs over me. I’ve got curly light-brown hair and 
hazel eyes. I’m twelve, which Mom says isn’t a “cute age”. 

My nose is long and curves up at the end like a hot dog. Ginny likes to flick 
the end of my nose with her finger and say, “Boi-oi-oing.” 

Her nose is small and perfect, of course. 

I tried to continue my show, Ginny or no Ginny. I slipped the deck of cards 
into my pocket and yanked out my magic scarf. “Now, be amazed as I—” 

Ginny reached into my pocket and snatched out the cards. “Look, 
everybody!” she cried, showing them the cards. “All the cards are the three of 
clubs!” 

Ginny started passing the cards around so everyone could see. 

“Hey! Give those back!” I protested. I grabbed the cards away. It was true. 
Every single card in the deck was the three of clubs. But no one was supposed to 
know that. 

“You’re a phony,” Sue mumbled. 

“No—wait!” I cried. “Watch this!” 

I whipped out my magic rings—two large silver hoops hooked together. 
The kids quieted down a little. 

“These silver rings are locked together,” I declared. “They’re completely 
solid—linked together forever!” I tugged on them to show that they wouldn’t 
come apart. 

Then I handed them to Jesse. “Try to pull the rings apart,” I told him. He 
pulled hard. He pulled lightly. He pulled hard again. He jangled them around. 
The rings stayed hooked together. 

I took them back. “The rings will never come apart,” I said. “Unless I say 
the magic words.” I waved one hand over the rings. “Hocus pocus!” I gently 
pulled the rings apart. A couple of kids clapped. 

“You’re not going to fall for that old trick, are you?” Ginny mocked. “You 
want to know how he does it?” She grabbed the rings away and began to 
demonstrate. “They’re trick rings—” 

“I will now make my lovely assistant disappear!” I cried, shoving Ginny 
aside. “Beat it!” 



“Stop pushing me!” she shouted. “Hi-ya!” 

She karate-kicked me in the stomach. 

“Oof!” I doubled over. Everybody laughed and clapped. 

“That’s a great trick!” Sue said. 

I clutched my stomach. Some trick. 

Stupid Ginny and her karate kicks. Why did Mom have to take her to that 
martial-arts school? My life has been miserable ever since. She’s only ten, and 
she fights way better than I do. I’ve got the bruises to show it. 

“Kick him again!” somebody yelled. 

Ginny crouched, ready to attack. 

“Try it, and I’ll tell Mom where that dent in the refrigerator door came 
from,” I warned her. 

She backed off. She knew Mom would kill her for karate-chopping the 
fridge just because we were out of ice cream. 

“She’s not going to kick him,” Jesse said. “Show’s over.” 

The kids drifted away. 

“Wait!” I cried. “Come back!” 

“See you tomorrow, Tim,” Sue said. Everybody began to head for home. 

“Thanks for wrecking everything, Ginny,” I snapped. 

She flicked my nose. “Boi-oi-oing.” 

“Stop it!” I swatted her away. “You’re definitely going to get it. I’m telling 
Mom about the fridge for sure.” 

“Go ahead,” she taunted. “But if you do, I’ll give you the freezer chop.” 
She waved her arms through the air, making those weird karate noises. “Wah 
wah wee — ah! Right to the neck. You’ll never walk again!” 

She trotted away. “See you at home, Swanz-O!” 

This is what I have to deal with every day of my life. A little sister who 
could kill me if she wanted to. What can I do? I’m helpless against her. 

That’s one reason I want to be a magician. Maybe Ginny can karate-chop 
my arms off—but not if I make her disappear first! 

I sighed and buttoned up my denim jacket. It was almost four o’clock and 
getting chilly. The wind had picked up, too. When is it going to get warm? I 
wondered. It’s the end of March—it’s supposed to be spring already. 

The school door burst open. “I’m outta here!” Foz shouted. 

Foz’s real name is Foster Martin. But he doesn’t look like a Foster. He’s a 
Foz. He’s chubby, with a brown buzz cut. His shirt is always untucked. 



“Where 5 ve you been?” I asked him. 

“Mrs. Pratt made me stay after school,” he replied, making a disgusted face. 

“Why?” I asked. 

“No reason,” Foz said. 

Foz has to stay after school almost every day. He always says it’s for no 
reason. 

I picked up my magic kit and started down the school steps. Foz followed. 
We left the school grounds and walked toward town. 

“What were you doing at school so late?” he asked. 

“I was trying out a few magic tricks. Ginny told everybody how they work. 
It was a disaster.” 

“You need better tricks,” Foz said. “Lots of kids have the same magic kit as 
yours.” 

“You’re right,” I agreed, rattling my kit. “This is amateur stuff. I’m ready 
for some real magic tricks. Professional ones.” 

“Like a hat you can pull a rabbit out of.” 

“Or that spinning box Amaz-0 has,” I added. 

Amaz-0 was my hero—the greatest magician ever. “Did you see him on 
TV last week? His assistant stepped into a big black box. Amaz-0 spun it around 
three times, and she disappeared!” 

“He’s doing a show at Midnight Mansion,” Foz said. Midnight Mansion is a 
club in town where magicians perform every night. 

“I know. I wish I could go. But the tickets cost twenty-five dollars.” 

We turned onto Bank Street and headed toward the center of town. It wasn’t 
on the way home, but Foz knew what I was doing. Malik’s Magic Shoppe was 
on Bank Street. I stopped in there at least once a week, just to drool over the cool 
tricks they had. 

“Malik’s has a bunch of new tricks,” I told Foz. “Designed by Amaz-0 
himself.” 

“I’ll bet they’re expensive,” Foz said. 

“They are.” I reached into my pocket to see how much money I had. Five 
bucks. 

“That’ll buy you a squirting flower,” Foz said. “Maybe.” 

I stuffed the bill back into my pocket. “You’ve got to see this stuff, anyway. 
There’s a table—you put a plate or something on it—it can be anything you 
want. The plate will rise up over the table and float!” 



“How does it work?” Foz asked. 

“I don’t know. Mr. Malik wouldn’t tell me. He said you have to buy the 
trick to find out.” 

“How much does it cost?” 

“Five hundred dollars.” 

Foz rolled his eyes. “I guess you’ll have to stick with card tricks.” 

“I guess.” I sighed. 

A little bell rang as we opened the door to Malik’s. I breathed in the musty 
smell of the shop. It was jam-packed with old tricks, new tricks, magic books, 
and costumes. There were even cages in the back for rabbits and doves. Mr. 
Malik sold everything. 

I called out, “Hi, Mr. Malik.” He stood behind the cash register. He was a 
short, bald old man with a fat stomach. 

I waited for Mr. Malik to say, “What’s new, Magoo?” in his gravelly voice. 
That’s how he greets all his regular customers. 

I called out, “Hi!” again, but he didn’t answer. He just stood there and 
grunted. 

“Mr. Malik?” Foz and I crept closer to the counter. 

“Unh!” Mr. Malik grunted. He stumbled forward. 

Something was sticking out of his stomach. A sword! 

“Mr. Malik?” I asked. “Are you okay?” 

He clutched the handle of the sword and moaned in pain. 

Someone had stabbed him! 

“Help me!” he groaned. “Please—help!” 

Foz and I froze in fear. I let out a gasp—but I was too frightened to move. 
Foz’s whole body trembled. 

Mr. Malik uttered another groan. Then his expression changed. He pulled 
out the sword—and he tossed it to me. 

“Hey!” I cried. “It’s a fake!” 

Mr. Malik laughed. He rubbed his round stomach, which hadn’t been 
stabbed at all. “What’s new, Magoo?” he chuckled. “Get a load of that trick 
sword. Just got it in today.” 

I tested the sword against my own stomach. It had a sliding blade. I pushed 
the blade into the handle, then let go. It popped out again. Very cool. 

Foz fingered the blade. “Think of the tricks you could play on Ginny with a 
sword like this! ” 



“Like it, Tim?” Mr. Malik asked. “Only twenty bucks.” 

I shook my head. “We’re just looking, Mr. Malik.” 

He hung the sword on the wall behind him. “All right. Take your time and 
look around. But would it kill you to actually buy something once in a while?” 

Mr. Malik always said that, too. 

I wandered to the back of the shop. I checked out a rack of magician’s 
jackets. I pulled a sparkly blue tuxedo jacket off the rack and tried it on. It had a 
trick sleeve for hiding things. 

I stared at myself in the mirror. I pretended to announce myself. “The 
Amazing Swanz-O!” 

Foz shook his head in disgust. “That name is so lame.” 

“Yeah, you’re right.” I thought of another name. “How about ‘Swanson the 
Magnificent’?” 

“It’s okay,” Foz said. “A little boring, but okay.” 

He tried on a top hat and added, “You need something cooler, like ‘Tim the 
Destroyer’.” 

“That sounds like a wrestler,” I commented. 

“At least it’s not wimpy,” Foz retorted. “Like Swanz-O.” 

“Hey, boys.” Mr. Malik shuffled toward us. He held out two tickets. 

“Take these, if you want them,” he said. “Two free passes to Amaz-O’s 
magic show tomorrow night.” 

“Wow!” I cried. I took a ticket and read it. 

Admit One 
An Evening of Magic 
with the Great Amaz-0 
March 23 
10 P.M. 

Midnight Mansion 

“Thanks Mr. Malik! I can’t believe we’ll get to see Amaz-0 in person!” I 
gushed. “Tomorrow night!” 

“Tomorrow night?” Foz frowned at his ticket. “I can’t go. My aunt and 
uncle are coming over. It’s my mother’s birthday.” 

“So? This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance! Your mother has a birthday every 
year.” 



Foz stuffed the ticket into my palm, shaking his head. “I know my mom— 
and she won’t see it that way. Anyway, tomorrow night is a school night.” 

I’d forgotten about that. I hoped my mom would let me go. Ten o’clock was 
pretty late to go out on a school night. 

She has to let me go, I decided. She just has to. What kind of horrible 
mother would keep her son from seeing his hero in person? Only a really mean, 
monstery mother. 

My mother is a grump, but she’s not a monster. 

I took off the blue jacket and hung it back up on the rack. A large wooden 
box caught my eye. It was the size of a coffin, brightly painted with red and 
yellow stars. I lifted the lid. 

The box was empty, lined with blue velvet on the inside. “What’s the box 
do, Mr. Malik?” I asked. 

“That’s for sawing people in half,” Mr. Malik replied. 

I examined the inside of the box, trying to figure out how it worked. I found 
no secret compartments or panels or anything. 

“How does it work?” I asked Mr. Malik. 

“You going to buy it?” he demanded. 

“Well—how much does it cost?” 

“Two-fifty.” 

“Two dollars and fifty cents? I can afford that.” 

Mr. Malik waved me away and started toward the stockroom at the back of 
the shop. “Two dollars and fifty cents,” he muttered. “In your dreams.” 

“He meant two hundred and fifty dollars, Brainz-O,” Foz said. 

I tried to cover myself. “I knew that. I was joking.” 

Foz fiddled with a cool-looking trick in the corner. I moved closer to see. 

“It’s a guillotine,” Foz said. “For chopping off heads.” 

The guillotine had a place for the victim to rest his head at the bottom—and 
a razor-sharp blade at the top. 

Mr. Malik emerged from the back room. “I’m closing up soon, boys,” he 
called. 

“I just want to see how this works,” Foz said. He twisted a lever on the 
guillotine. 

“Foz—no!” I cried. 

The blade slid down the guillotine. 

And landed with a horrifying thunk. 



“My hand!” Foz shrieked. “My hand!” 



2 


Mr. Malik gasped. “I’ll call an ambulance! Nine-one-one!” He grabbed the 
phone. 

The guillotine blade had sliced right through Foz’s hand. He screamed in 

pain. 

“Oh!” Foz moaned. “I cut off my hand!” he wailed. “I’ll never write again!” 

I started laughing. 

“Why are you laughing?” Mr. Malik demanded. “This is an emergency!” 

“No, it’s not.” Foz held up his hands to show that he was fine. “Got a paper 
towel? I need to wipe off this fake blood.” 

“Fake?” Mr. Malik stammered. “Fake blood?” 

“We got you back for that sword trick,” I told him. 

Mr. Malik clutched his sweaty forehead in his hands. “I’m so stupid! I 
know that’s a trick guillotine. Why did I fall for such a dumb joke?” 

“Hey,” Foz protested. “It was a lot funnier than your sword-in-the-stomach 
joke.” 

Mr. Malik wiped his brow and smiled. “All right, boys. Enough tricks. It’s 
five o’clock. Get out of here.” He shoved us toward the door. 

“Thanks for the tickets, Mr. Malik,” I called. “See you next week.” 

“Sure. Next week, when I’ll have a new shipment of magic tricks you won’t 
buy.” 

The bell on the door jangled as we left the shop. Foz and I walked down 
Bank Street toward home. 

“Sure you won’t go to Midnight Mansion tomorrow night?” I asked him. 

“I can’t. Your mom will never let you go, either.” 

“I’ll find a way,” I insisted. “You’ll see.” 

We paused in front of Foz’s house. “Come over to my house after school 
tomorrow,” I said. “I’m giving another magic show. Only this time Ginny won’t 
wreck it.” 

“I’ll be there,” Foz promised. 

“And bring your sister’s rabbit,” I added. 

Foz shuffled his feet uncomfortably. “Clare is not going to like that...” he 



began. 

“Please, Foz,” I begged. “I’m going to finish building my rabbit table 
tonight. The rabbit trick is going to be so amazing—” 

“I’ll try to bring the rabbit,” Foz said. “But if anything happens to it, Clare 
will kill me.” 

“Nothing will happen to it—I promise.” 

I waved good-bye to Foz and went home. “The Great Swanzini is here!” I 
announced as I burst into the kitchen. 

“You mean the Great Jerk,” Ginny mumbled. She sat at the kitchen table, 
folding napkins. She reached up and flicked at my nose. “Boi-oi-oing.” 

“Get off me.” I slapped her hand away. 

Mom set a plate of chicken on the table. “Go wash up, Tim,” she ordered. 
“And tell your father supper is ready.” 

“Look, Mom.” I held up a quarter. Then, with a flick of my wrist, I slipped 
it up my sleeve. “I made the quarter disappear!” 

I showed her my two empty hands. 

“Very nice. I see two hands that haven’t been washed yet,” Mom said 
impatiently. 

“I saw the quarter go up your sleeve,” Ginny sneered. 

“No one appreciates me around here,” I complained. “Someday I’m going 
to be the greatest magician in the world. And my own family doesn’t care!” 

Mom strode to the kitchen door. “Bill!” she called upstairs to my dad. 
“Supper!” 

I made my way out of the kitchen to wash my hands. My parents didn’t take 
my magic act seriously. They thought it was just a hobby. 

But Ginny’s karate lessons were the most important thing in the world, of 
course. Mom always said, “Girls need to know how to defend themselves.” Now 
I needed to defend myself against my own sister! 

I returned to the kitchen and sat down. Mom plunked a piece of chicken 
down beside the rice on my plate. Dad and Ginny were already eating. 

“I had a terrible day at work today,” Mom grumbled, ripping into her 
chicken. She’s a high school guidance counselor. “First Michael Lamb 
threatened to beat up another boy. His teacher yelled at him, and he threatened to 
beat her up, too. She sent him to my office. When I tried to talk to him, he said 
he’d beat me up. So I called his mother in—and she tried to beat me up. I had to 
call the police!” 



“That’s a piece of cake next to my day,” Dad complained. Dad sells cars. 
“Some guy came in and said he wanted to test-drive the new minivan. I handed 
him the keys, and he took off. He never came back. He stole the car!” 

I sighed and shoveled rice into my mouth. Dinner is like this every night. 
Both of my parents hate their jobs. 

“I had a really tough day, too,” Ginny put in. “Michael Franklin teased me. 
So I had to karate-kick him in the leg!” 

I smirked. “Poor you.” 

Mom’s forehead wrinkled—her concerned look. “You didn’t hurt yourself, 
did you, Ginny?” 

“No,” Ginny replied. “But I could have.” 

“What about me?” I protested. “I’m the one who got kicked in the stomach. 
And it hurt a lot!” 

“You seem to be fine now,” Dad chimed in. 

I gave up. I knew that arguing would get me nowhere. Mom and Dad 
always take Ginny’s side. 

“Is there any dessert?” Ginny demanded. 

“Ice cream,” Mom answered. 

“I’ll clear the table,” I offered, hoping it would put Mom in a better mood. I 
needed both Mom and Dad to be in a good mood. 

Because I was about to ask the big question. 

Would they let me go to Midnight Mansion tomorrow night? 

Would they?

I stood up, collecting dirty plates. “Guess what? Amaz-0 is doing his act at 
Midnight Mansion tomorrow night. Mr. Malik gave me two free passes.” I held 
my breath, waiting for their answer. 

“Excellent!” Ginny cried. “That means I can go too!” 

“I’m not taking you,” I told her. “I’ll ask Mark or Jesse or somebody. 
Anybody but you.” I dropped the plates in the sink. They crashed but didn’t 
break. 

“Careful, Tim,” Mom warned. 

Ginny slithered over to the sink and tried to hug me. “Please, Tim. I’m your 
sister. Your only sister in the whole world. I’d do anything for you. You have to 
take me with you!” 

“Neither one of you is going,” Dad said quietly. “It’s a school night.” 

“But Dad, it’s free!” I protested. “Just this once. Amaz-0 is my hero. I’ll 
never get another chance to see him in person!” 

“What time does the show start?” Mom asked. 

“Ten o’clock,” I told her. 

She shook her head. “Absolutely not. You’re not going out at ten o’clock on 
a school night. Especially not to a nightclub. You’re much too young.” She 
furiously spooned ice cream into a bowl. 

“Mom—please!” I begged. “I’m twelve. I can handle it.” 

“You heard your mother,” Dad said. “You’ll have other chances to see 
Amaz-O, Tim. Don’t worry.” 

Mom offered me a bowl of ice cream. “I don’t want it,” I grumbled. I 
stormed out of the kitchen. As I left, I heard Ginny say, “Good. Now I’ll get two 
bowls of ice cream.” 

Stupid Ginny, I thought. Stupid Mom and stupid Dad. My one chance to see 
my idol, the great Amaz-0—and they won’t let me go. 

I wandered into the garage. In the corner stood a new trick I was building— 
the rabbit table. It was a square table that came up to my waist. The top had a 
hole in it that led to a secret compartment under the table. 

I planned to hide a rabbit in the compartment and cover the hole with my 
magic top hat. When I pressed a pedal at the foot of the table, the bottom of the 



secret compartment would rise up. Then I’d lift my hat—and there would be the 
rabbit! 

The table was almost finished. I turned it upside down and hammered on 
the bottom of the secret compartment. 

This trick is going to knock everybody out tomorrow afternoon, I thought. 
I’ll be almost as amazing as Amaz-O! 

I was so busy hammering I didn’t hear the garage door open. Two baby blue 
high-tops suddenly appeared in front of me. I didn’t have to look up. I knew 
Ginny’s smelly sneakers when I saw them. 

“Go away,” I commanded. 

She never listens to me. “You going to do the rabbit trick tomorrow?” she 
asked. 

“Uh-huh. Now go away.” 

“Where are you going to get the rabbit?” 

I set down my hammer. “I’m going to turn you into a rabbit.” 

“Ha ha.” She flipped her wavy blond hair. “You know what this table would 
be perfect for?” she asked. “Karate-chopping. I’ll bet I could chop it in half with 
one hand.” 

“Try it and I’ll—” 

“You’ll what?” she taunted. 

What could I do to her? Not much. “I’ll turn you into a rabbit for real,” I 
threatened. 

“Oh, yeah? How are you going to do that?” 

“It’s easy,” I replied. “Mr. Malik showed me how. Tonight, while you’re 
sleeping, I’m going to sneak into your room and turn you into a rabbit.” 

“Give me a break,” Ginny said. “That is so dumb.” 

“Maybe. Maybe not. I guess we’ll find out tonight.” I picked up my 
hammer again. “I hope you like carrots,” I told her. 

“You’re crazy,” she said. She hurried out of the garage. 

Well, I thought. At least that got rid of her for a while. 

I set the table on its legs again. All I had to do was paint it, and it would be 
ready. 

Wouldn’t it be great? I thought as I opened a can of blue paint. Wouldn’t it 
be great if I really could turn Ginny into a rabbit? 

But that was impossible. Wasn’t it?

“We want the rabbit trick! We want the rabbit trick!” 

Ginny sat in the grass in our backyard. Six or seven other kids sat around. I 
was in the middle of my magic act. Ginny was stirring up trouble. 

She knew I didn’t have a rabbit for the trick. I was still waiting for Foz to 
show up. 

Where is he? I wondered. He’s ruining my show! 

The other kids joined in Ginny’s chant. “The rabbit trick! The rabbit trick!” 

I tried to stall them. “The amazing, incredible rabbit trick is coming up,” I 
promised. “But first—wouldn’t you like to see me pull a quarter out of Ginny’s 
ear again?” 

“No!” the kids yelled. “Boo!” 

“Karate fight!” Sue called. “We want a karate fight. Ginny versus Tim!” 

Things were getting ugly. 

At last I glimpsed Foz at the side of the house. He waved at me frantically. 

“Intermission!” I announced. “I’ll be back in two minutes. And then—I’ll 
pull a rabbit out of my hat!” 

I hurried over to Foz. A big cardboard box sat at his feet. 

“What took you so long?” I demanded. 

“I’m sorry,” Foz said. “I almost had to rip the rabbit out of Clare’s hands.” 

I opened the box. Clare’s big white rabbit lifted its nose and sniffed at me. I 
grabbed it and stuffed it under my jacket. 

“Be careful!” Foz warned. “If anything happens to it, my sister will chop 
me into rabbit food!” 

“The rabbit will be fine,” I told him. “What could happen to it?” 

I sneaked the rabbit to the table. With my back to the audience, I stuffed it 
into the secret compartment and plopped my hat on top. 

Then I turned to face the kids. None of them had seen the rabbit. Perfect. 

“Ladies and gentlemen!” I called. “Thanks for being so patient. Here is the 
moment you’ve all been waiting for—” 

“Karate fight!” Ginny called. 

“Even better than a karate fight!” I said. “I, the Great Timothini, will now 



pull a rabbit out of my hat!” 

Ginny snorted. “The Great Timothini?” 

I pointed at her. “You, in the front row. Quiet!” 

“You be quiet!” Ginny shot back. 

“Get on with it!” Jesse called. 

“Okay. I need complete silence now. I must concentrate.” 

To my surprise, the kids actually quieted down. Even Ginny. Everyone 
stared up at me, waiting. 

I lifted my hat off the table. “As you can see, my hat is empty. It’s an 
ordinary, everyday top hat. Sue, will you please examine the hat?” 

I passed the hat to Sue. She turned it over. “It looks like a regular hat to 
me,” she declared. 

I set the hat on the table, covering the secret compartment. “Thank you, 
Sue. Now—watch carefully.” 

I waved my arms over the hat. “Abracadabra, abracadeer, rabbit, rabbit, 
rabbit— appear! ” 

I stepped on the pedal to make the rabbit rise up. Then I lifted the hat with a 
flourish. 

Nothing there. The hat stood empty. 

I checked the secret compartment. No rabbit there, either. 

My heart pounded. How could this be? 

“The rabbit!” I cried. “It’s gone!” 



5 


What have I done? I thought in horror. 

My trick must have worked better than I thought! 

I glanced up and saw Ginny pointing across the backyard. “There it goes!” 
she cried. “There’s the rabbit!” 

I whirled around. Clare’s white rabbit was hopping away. 

How could that happen? I wondered. I glanced into the secret compartment 
again. 

I’d left one side of the secret compartment open. How could I have been so 
stupid? 

“Tim—you promised!” Foz screamed. “Grab it!” 

I chased after the rabbit. Foz huffed behind me. The rabbit had already 
hopped halfway across our next-door neighbors’ backyard. I glanced back. 
Ginny and the other kids were yelling and running after us. 

The rabbit stopped behind a bush. I sped up—and pounced. 

“Got him!” I cried. But the rabbit slipped out of my hands and bounded 
away. 

“He’s headed for the stream!” Ginny shouted. 

A muddy stream ran behind all the backyards on our block. The rabbit 
disappeared behind the trees that hid the stream. 

Whooping like crazy, Ginny led the kids after the rabbit. 

“Stop!” I yelled. “You’re scaring it away!” 

But none of them listened to me. There was nothing to do but keep chasing. 

“Don’t let the rabbit hop into the water!” Foz screamed. “He’ll drown!” 

“He won’t drown,” I told Foz. “That stream is only about two inches deep.” 

“Just catch the rabbit!” Foz ordered. He was in a total panic. Maybe his 
sister really would chop him into rabbit food. 

The rabbit hopped through the mud and across the stream into the Darbys’ 
yard. I shoved the other kids aside. I splashed through the stream. 

The rabbit stopped. Its ears twitched. 

I motioned to the others to keep still. I squatted down and crept toward the 
rabbit. 



I saw why it had stopped. The Darbys’ cat, Boo Boo, crouched low in the 
grass, waiting to pounce. 

The rabbit was trapped between us. I crawled closer. Closer. I was almost 
there.... 

“Watch out for the cat!” Foz shrieked. 

With a yowl, the cat leaped. The rabbit bounced about a foot in the air. I 
missed him. 

Everybody raced after him again. I threw Foz a dirty look. 

“You’re ruining everything!” I shouted. 

“You’re the one who lost him in the first place!” Foz yelled back. 

“Hey!” Sue called. “Look at Ginny!” 

Ginny had raced to the head of the pack. The rabbit paused, then started 
mnning again. Ginny took a flying leap. “Yaw, hee ha how!” she screeched in 
her weirdo karate voice. 

She landed on her feet in front of the rabbit. It tried to change course. Too 

late. 

“Hiii—ya!” Ginny swooped down and grabbed the rabbit. She held him 
over her head like a trophy. 

“I got him!” she cried. “I got him!” 

“Yay, Ginny!” Everyone crowded around her, slapping her on the back. 

“Don’t let him go!” Foz cried. He hurried over to Ginny and snatched the 
rabbit away. 

We all started back to my yard. “Awesome trick, Tim.” Jesse patted me on 
the back. “You almost made the rabbit really disappear!” 

Everybody laughed. “You should change your stage name, Timothini,” Sue 
chimed in. “How about ‘The Great Goofballini’?” 

“Or ‘Mess-Up the Magnificent’!” Jesse suggested. 

I sighed and shut my eyes. Another magic show—another disaster. 

“I can’t believe you almost lost my sister’s rabbit,” Foz grumbled. 

“I’m sorry, Foz. I’ll be more careful next time.” 

He clutched the rabbit tightly to his chest. “Next time, get your own rabbit.” 

He hurried to the side of the house and stuffed the rabbit into the box. 

“Anybody want to come over to my house?” Jesse called. He lived next 
door. “I’ve got a great trick to show you—the disappearing dog. I let go of his 
leash, and he runs away!” 

Laughing, the other kids drifted over to Jesse’s house. Foz took the rabbit 



home to his sister. 

“You going over to Jesse’s?” Ginny asked. 

I shook my head. “I’m going inside for a snack.” 

“Maybe you should do your magic act inside from now on,” Ginny said. 
“Then your tricks won’t be able to escape from you!” She giggled. 

“Very funny,” I mumbled. “You won’t be laughing so hard when I turn you 
into a rabbit. I don’t think rabbits know how to laugh.” 

“Ooh. I’m scared.” She rolled her eyes. 

“You’d better be.” I leaned close to her and whispered. “Tonight’s the night. 
Tonight, while you’re sleeping, I’ll turn you into a rabbit. And if you try to run 
away, the Darbys’ cat will get you.” 

She rolled her eyes again. Then she reached up to tweak my nose. “Boi-oi- 
oing.” 

She trotted off to Jesse’s house. 

I definitely need better magic tricks, I thought as I dragged myself into the 
house. Better equipment, too. So I can do really cool tricks. Tricks that actually 
work. 

I thought of all the stuff Mr. Malik sold in his shop. If I could have just one 
of those tricks, I could do a great act. I’ve got to get one somehow. 

But how? 

That night everybody went to bed early. Mom and Dad were exhausted and 
crabby after another bad day at work. 

“Today was the worst day ever!” Mom grumbled. “I’m so exhausted. 
Everybody to bed!” 

Ginny and I knew better than to protest. We didn’t want to stay up, anyway, 
with Mom and Dad grouching around all evening. 

I lay in bed with the lights off, trying to sleep. Amaz-O’s show is tonight, I 
thought miserably. He’s performing tonight, only a few miles away from my 
house. I have free passes. And I can’t go. It’s not fair! 

How am I ever going to be a great magician if I never see any magic 
shows? Amaz-0 is the greatest of the great—and I have to miss my one chance 
to see him! 

Or do I? A wicked thought popped into my head. Why should I miss the 
show? 

I’ve got the tickets. I can ride to Midnight Mansion on my bike. I could 



sneak out of the house for a couple of hours—and Mom and Dad would never 
have to know. 

I rolled over in bed and peered at my alarm clock. The dial glowed in the 
dark. Nine-forty. 

The show would start in twenty minutes, I knew. I could still make it if I 
left right now. 

I couldn’t stand to think about it any longer. I had to go. 

I slid out of bed, hoping my mattress wouldn’t creak. I tiptoed across the 
room to my dresser. I silently pulled on a pair of jeans and a shirt. 

Sneakers in hand, I carefully opened my bedroom door. The house was 
dark. I heard Dad snoring in my parents’ room down the hall. 

I crept toward the stairs. Am I really doing this? I thought, suddenly 
nervous. Am I really sneaking out in the middle of the night to go to Midnight 
Mansion? 



6 


Yes—I’m really doing it, I thought. I’ll do anything to see Amaz-O. It’s totally 
worth the risk. 

What’s the worst that could happen? 

Mom and Dad could find out. Then what? Maybe they’d ground me. But I 
will have seen the great Amaz-0 in person. And while I’m grounded, I can try to 
learn some of Amaz-O’s tricks. 

Anyway, I won’t get caught. I won’t. 

I paused at the top of the stairs. The stairs in my house are the creakiest 
stairs in the universe. 

Once when I was little, I tried to sneak downstairs on Christmas Eve to see 
what Santa had left me. I barely touched the top step with my foot 
— CRRREEEEAAAK! Mom burst out of her room before I even had a chance to 
try the second step. 

It’s not going to happen this time, I told myself. I’ll take each step very 
slowly. I’ll lean on the banister to keep them from creaking. No one will wake 
up. No one will hear me. 

I put both my hands on the banister and rested my weight on it. Then I set 
my right foot carefully—the toe, then the heel—on the top step. 

Crick. Just a tiny little sound. I’m sure no one heard it, I thought. 

I shifted my hands down the banister and took another step. This one made 
no creak at all. 

So far, so good. 

I took the third step. Creak. Not a rip-roaring loud creak, but louder than the 
first. I froze. 

I listened for the sound of someone stirring in the house. 

Silence. All clear. 

If Amaz-0 only knew what I’m going through to see him, I thought. I must 
be his biggest fan on the face of the earth. 

I made it all the way down the stairs with only one more creak. I breathed a 
sigh of relief. 

I’m safe now, I thought. I’ll wait until I get outside to put my shoes on. 
Then I’ll grab my bike and go. 



I tiptoed across the cold hallway floor. I reached for the handle of the front 
door. Twisted it. 

Almost there. 

Almost. 

Then a shrill voice demanded, “Tim—where do you think you’re going?” 



7 


I spun around. Ginny! 

She was dressed in jeans and a sweater, all ready to go out. She bounded 
down the stairs. 

“Ssshhhhhhhh! You’ll wake up Mom and Dad!” 

I grabbed her by the arm and yanked her out the front door. 

“What are you doing up?” I demanded. 

“I was waiting for you to come into my room and turn me into a rabbit,” 
she replied. “Or pretend to, anyway.” 

“I’m not going to do that tonight,” I said. “Go back to bed.” 

“What are you doing up? Where are you going?” 

I sat on the front steps and pulled on my sneakers. “Out to the garage,” I 
lied. “To practice a new trick.” 

“You are not. I know where you’re going. To Midnight Mansion!” 

I grabbed her by the shoulders. “Okay. You’re right. I’m going to Midnight 
Mansion. Don’t tell Mom and Dad—promise?” 

“I want to go!” she insisted. “Let me go with you.” 

“No. Go back to bed—and don’t tell. Or you’ll be sorry.” 

“You have to take me!” she declared. “If you don’t, I’ll run upstairs and tell 
Mom and Dad right now. Then you’ll never get to see Amaz-O.” 

“You wouldn’t.” 

“I would.” 

I knew she would. 

“All right,” I agreed. “You can come. But you have to be good and do 
everything I tell you to do.” 

“Maybe I will—and maybe I won’t.” 

I sighed. I had to take her, no matter how bratty she was. If I did, she’d 
never tell—because then she’d be in as much trouble as me. 

“Let’s go,” I whispered. 

We sneaked into the garage and got our bikes. Then we pedaled off into the 
night. 

It felt strange riding down Bank Street late at night. The shops were all 



closed and dark. Hardly any traffic on the street. 

Oh, no. A police car up ahead—cruising toward us down Bank Street. If he 
spotted us, he’d stop us for sure. And then he’d take us home. And then we’d 
really be in trouble. 

I searched desperately for a place to hide. The police couldn’t miss us— 
Bank Street was lined with streetlights. 

“Ginny!” I called. “Quick—out of the light!” I swerved into the dark 
doorway of a dress shop. Ginny followed. We leaped off our bikes and pressed 
ourselves into the shadows. 

The police car glided past. I held my breath as the headlights brushed across 
us. The car stopped. 

“He saw us!” Ginny whispered. “Run!” 

I grabbed her arm to stop her. “Wait.” I peeked out into the street. 

The police car was idling, but the driver stayed inside. 

“It’s a red light,” I told Ginny. A few seconds later the light turned green, 
and the police car rolled away. 

“We’re safe now,” I said. We hopped back onto our bikes and rode off. 

Midnight Mansion loomed huge and dark at the edge of town. People said 
that a crazy old woman had lived alone in the mansion for forty years. She was 
rich, but so stingy she wore ragged old clothes and ate nothing but peanut butter, 
right out of the jar. 

When people tried to visit her, she screamed, “Go away!” and threw rocks 
at them. She had about fifty cats. When she died, a businessman bought the 
mansion and turned it into a nightclub. 

I braked in front of the old house and stared at it. Midnight Mansion. 

It looked like a spooky old castle made of sooty black stone. Three stories 
tall, with two towers shooting up into the night sky. Vines crept across the roof. 
A floodlight threw creepy shadows over the house. 

I’d seen the mansion a million times before. But late at night it looked 
bigger and darker than usual. I thought I saw bats fluttering around the two 
towers. 

“No wonder the old lady went crazy,” Ginny whispered. “Living in a 
spooky place like that.” 

“Do you think she kept prisoners in those towers?” I wondered. 

“I think she had a torture chamber in the basement,” Ginny said. 

We walked our bikes up to the entrance. People hurried inside to see Amaz- 



O’s magic show. Three men in long black capes breezed past us. A woman with 
long black hair, black lipstick, and pointy black fingernails smiled at me. 

“Where did all these weird people come from?” Ginny asked. 

I shrugged. “Let’s go in. The show is about to start.” 

We locked our bikes and ran up the long stone steps. We entered a big hall 
lit by a crystal chandelier. We crossed the hall to a doorway covered by a heavy 
red curtain. 

A tall, thin man in a black tuxedo guarded the curtain. He reached out a 
long, bony finger to stop us. 

He had no hair, a pencil neck, and dark, hollow eye sockets. “He looks like 
a skeleton,” Ginny whispered to me. 

I pulled the two tickets out of my back pocket and handed them to him. 

“Very good,” he croaked in a low voice. “But where are your parents? I 
can’t seat children without their parents.” 

My parents? Think fast, Swanz-O, I told myself. “Um—my parents. Yes. 
Well, my parents, you see...” I had a feeling he didn’t want to hear that my 
parents were home sleeping. 

“They’re outside, parking the car,” I lied. “They’ll be here in a minute. 
They told us to come in and get a table.” 

The man’s hollow black eyes seemed to burn a hole in my brain. Would he 
buy it? 

“I don’t like it. But all right.” He led us through the red curtain. The 
houselights went down just as we walked in. He showed us to a table right next 
to the stage. 

“Excellent!” I said to Ginny as we sat down. “The best seats in the whole 
place!” 

“This is so exciting!” she exclaimed. “I can’t believe we’re in a real, grown¬ 
up nightclub. By ourselves!” 

The eerie-looking host stood by the red curtain, watching us. “We may not 
be here long,” I warned her. “That skeleton guy’s got his eye on us. When he 
realizes we’re not here with our parents—” 

“Shh! The show’s starting.” 

A voice came over a loudspeaker. “Ladies and gentlemen! Midnight 
Mansion is proud to present the most famous magician in America. The 
fabulous, the incredible, the mind-boggling Amaz-O!” 

A drum roll, and then horns bleating “Ta da!” The audience clapped and 



cheered. The curtain rose. 

I gasped when I saw the stage. It was filled with wonderful equipment—a 
tall, shiny black box with a door in the front, a platform suspended from the 
ceiling, a glittering box with holes in it for a head, arms, and legs to stick out of. 
And a big white rabbit sitting beside a vase of blue flowers on a table covered 
with a red scarf. 

The rabbit wasn’t tied up or caged or anything. “I wonder how he keeps that 
rabbit from running away,” Ginny whispered. “That’s a trick you need to learn.” 

“You’re so funny, Ginny,” I said, rolling my eyes. “My sides are splitting 
with laughter.” 

“You have no sense of humor,” Ginny jeered. “That’s your problem.” 

“No. You’re my problem,” I snapped. 

Amaz-0 strode onstage. He was tall and slim, and his top hat made him 
seem even taller. He had long black hair and wore a black cape lined with red 
satin over a black tuxedo. 

He tossed the cape over his shoulders and bowed. 

I can’t believe I’m seeing Amaz-0 in person! I thought, my heart pounding 
with excitement. And so close—I could almost touch him! 

Maybe I’ll even see how some of his tricks are done, I thought. Maybe, 
sitting so close, I’ll catch some of his secrets! 

Without saying a word, Amaz-0 scanned the audience. He trained his eyes 
on me. 

My whole body shook. He’s staring right at me! I gasped. 

Amaz-0 took a step forward and leaned toward me. 

What’s he doing? I thought. Is he going to talk to me? 

Amaz-0 leaned closer. His face was right next to mine! I cowered in my 

seat. 

He scowled and whispered in a deep, menacing voice, “Disappear! 
Disappear!” 



8 


I shrank back. 

“Disappear!” he growled again. 

“Excuse me?” I gasped. I stared up at him. On TV he seemed friendly. But 
in person he was definitely frightening. 

“Disappear!” he whispered. “I’m going to make you disappear at the end of 
the show. I will ask for volunteers—and I will choose you.” 

He didn’t want me to disappear for real. He wanted me to be part of his act! 
I couldn’t believe it! 

I’ll find out how he does his famous disappearing trick! I thought. Maybe 
I’ll get to meet him after the show. Maybe he’ll even tell me some of his secrets! 

Ginny leaned across the table. “He’s going to make you disappear forever!” 
she teased. “What will I tell Mom and Dad?” 

I paid no attention to her. Nothing Ginny did or said could bother me now. 

This was too cool! Just seeing Amaz-0 was exciting enough. But he chose 
me to be in his show! 

Maybe he could tell that I’m a magician, too, I thought. 

Amaz-0 began his act. “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,” he crooned. 
“Tonight you will see some amazing feats. You will see me do things you always 
thought were impossible. Are these feats real—or are they illusions? It’s up to 
you to decide.” 

He waved his hands, and a wand appeared out of thin air. The audience 
clapped. 

Then Amaz-0 began to fidget with his hat, as if it felt uncomfortable on his 
head. “Something is wrong with my hat,” he said. “It feels strange—almost as 
if...” 

He lifted the hat off his head and peered into it. He showed us the inside of 
it. It looked perfectly normal. There was nothing inside it. 

He placed it back on his head. “It’s funny,” he chuckled. “I thought for a 
minute there might be something inside my hat. I thought I felt—oh, I don’t 
know—a flock of birds fluttering around in there.” 

The hat jiggled. Amaz-0 appeared annoyed. “There it goes again!” 

He whipped the hat off his head and stared into it. On top of his head sat a 



large white feather. People in the audience giggled. 

“What’s so funny?” Amaz-0 asked. He felt the top of his head and found 
the feather. “Where did that come from?” he gasped, acting amazed. Everyone 
laughed. 

“Well, I’ll try not to let this bother me,” he went on, replacing his hat. 
“Back to the show. For my first trick—” 

The hat began to shake again—slightly at first, then harder. It practically 
jumped off his head. The audience cracked up. Amaz-0 pretended to be 
horrified. 

He yanked the hat off his head—and out flew a whole flock of doves! They 
swooped over the audience and flew up to the rafters. 

“I knew something was going on in there!” Amaz-0 joked. Loud laughter 
and clapping. 

He’s the greatest, I thought, clapping along. How did he get all those birds 
inside his hat? 

I glanced at the rabbit on stage. It sat calmly on the table, staring at Amaz- 
O. It almost seemed to be watching the act. 

I can’t wait to see his rabbit trick, I thought. Will he make the rabbit 
disappear? Or pull off some kind of twist? 

“For my next trick I need a needle and thread,” Amaz-0 announced. He 
produced a packet of needles and a long, thick thread from one of his pockets. 
He picked out a needle and squinted, trying to push the thread through the eye. 

“I always have trouble threading a needle,” he said. He licked the end of the 
thread and tried again. He couldn’t get the thread to go through. 

He threw up his hands in frustration. “It’s impossible!” he cried. “How do 
tailors do it?” 

The audience chuckled. I waited to see what would come next. I knew all 
this needle-and-thread business was a buildup to something incredible. 

“So much for the hard way to thread a needle,” Amaz-0 said. “I’ll show 
you a better way.” 

He snatched up the packet of needles. There must have been at least twenty 
needles stuck into a piece of cardboard. He popped the whole thing into his 
mouth. Then he dangled the long string over his mouth like a piece of spaghetti. 

He slowly drew the string into his mouth, chewing. It looked as if he were 
eating a piece of spaghetti—with a packet of needles in his mouth, too. 

“Don’t you think that hurts?” Ginny whispered. “Chewing up all those 



needles?” 

I barely nodded. I watched Amaz-O, spellbound. 

Amaz-0 nearly swallowed the whole string. About an inch of string stuck 
out between his lips. The audience waited, hushed. 

He paused. Then he opened his mouth and tugged at the string. Slowly, 
slowly, he pulled it out of his mouth. 

One by one the needles appeared—dangling from the string! Somehow he 
had threaded twenty needles with his tongue! 

The audience gasped, then applauded. The needles flashed as Amaz-0 held 
up the string. 

“Threading needles the easy way!” he cried as he took another bow. 

I’ve got to find out how he did that, I thought. Maybe I’ll ask him after the 
show. 

“How’s the show going?” Amaz-0 asked the audience. We all cheered. “I 
wonder how much time we have left?” He strode across the stage to the table 
where the rabbit and the blue flowers sat on top of the red scarf. 

With a flick of his wrist, he yanked the scarf out from under the rabbit. 

The rabbit didn’t move. Neither did the vase of flowers. The table was now 

bare. 

The rabbit blinked calmly. Amaz-0 waved the scarf over his left hand. He 
let it drop—and a big red alarm clock appeared in his hand! 

He glanced at the clock. “I suppose we have time for a few more tricks.” He 
covered the clock with the scarf—and the clock disappeared. 

A loud ringing suddenly erupted from the other side of the stage. I turned 
toward it. 

The red alarm clock—floating in midair! It seemed to have flown across the 
stage by itself. 

Amaz-0 crossed the stage, grabbed the clock, and shut off the alarm. 

“My clock is a little fast,” he joked. “It’s not time for the show to end. Not 

yet.” 

I hope not, I thought. This is the greatest magic act I’ve ever seen in my 

life! 

The rest of the show was fantastic, too. Amaz-0 escaped from a locked 
safe. He walked through a brick wall. He tapped his hat with his magic wand— 
and in a puff of smoke his tuxedo changed from black to yellow! 

“And now for my big finale,” Amaz-0 announced. “I am going to make a 



member of the audience disappear. Are there any volunteers?” 

He gazed out over the audience. No one said a word. Ginny kicked me 
under the table. 

“Ow!” I whispered, rubbing my skin. “What did you do that for?” 

“He asked for volunteers, you moron,” she said. “That means you.” 

I’d been so caught up in the show, I almost forgot. I stood up. “I’d like to 
volunteer.” 

Amaz-0 smiled. “Excellent, young man. Please step up on stage.” 

My stomach suddenly jolted with terror. I stumbled up to the stage. 

Here I go, I thought nervously. Amaz-0 is going to make me disappear. 

I hope nothing goes wrong. 



9 


Amaz-0 towered over me on stage. This is unbelievable, I thought. I’m on stage 
with the great Amaz-O. I’m about to be part of one of his famous tricks. 

He’s going to make me disappear! 

I clutched my stomach, wondering, Why do I feel so scared? 

“Thanks for volunteering, young man,” Amaz-0 said to me. “You must be 
very brave. Are your parents here tonight?” 

My parents? Uh-oh. “Um—they’re here. Sure they’re here,” I stammered. 
“But—uh—they had to make a phone call.” 

Amaz-0 frowned. “A phone call? In the middle of my show?” 

“Well—it was an emergency,” I explained. 

“Never mind. I’m glad they’ve stepped away. If they knew what was about 
to happen to you, they might try to stop me.” 

“Stop you?” My heart skittered nervously. But I heard the audience 
laughing. 

Don’t let him scare you, I told myself. This is just part of the act. He’s 
joking. 

I faked a laugh. “What—um—exactly—is about to happen to me?” 

“I’m going to make you disappear,” Amaz-0 replied. “You will be 
transported into another dimension. I will try my best to bring you back, of 
course—but it doesn’t always work.” 

“It doesn’t?” I gulped. 

He patted me on the back. “Don’t worry. I’ve done this hundreds of times. 
I’ve only missed once or twice.” 

The audience chuckled. They figured he was kidding. I hoped they were 
right. 

“Is that your sister sitting at the front table?” Amaz-0 asked. 

I nodded. 

“Better wave good-bye to her, just in case,” he warned me. 

Ginny smiled and waved at me. 

She can’t wait for me to disappear! I thought bitterly. She hopes I’ll never 
come back. 



“Go on,” Amaz-0 urged. “Wave to her.” 

I smiled weakly and waved at Ginny. The audience laughed. Then Amaz-0 
led me to a tall black box in the center of the stage. He threw open the door. It 
looked like a closet inside. 

“Step inside here if you would, please,” he said. 

I stepped inside the box. Amaz-0 shut the door firmly. 

It was pitch-black inside that box. I stood still, waiting for something to 
happen. I could hear Amaz-0 talking to the audience. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, this box is my own invention—the Fifth Dimension 
Spin-o-Rama.” I heard him slap his hand against the side of the box. 

“Here’s how it works: my brave volunteer steps inside the box. I lock him 
in. I spin the box ten times —very fast. 

“A magical force inside the box will send the boy into another dimension. 
He will disappear! 

“I must ask for absolute silence while I do this trick. I need complete 
concentration.” 

For several seconds I heard nothing. 

Then the box began to spin. “Whoa!” I cried. My body slammed against the 
back of the box. 

It whirled around faster than any ride in an amusement park. I shut my eyes. 
I felt so dizzy. 

I hope I don’t puke, I thought. That would spoil everything. 

The box kept spinning, spinning. How will the trick work? I wondered. 
How will I disappear? 

What if he really sends me into another dimension? 

But that’s just talk, I told myself. Magician talk—to entertain the audience. 

Isn’t it? 



10 


The box spun faster and faster. I clutched my stomach. I saw stars dancing 
before my eyes. 

When is it going to stop? I thought. I’m really going to be sick. 

Then, suddenly, the bottom of the box dropped out from under me. 

“Help!” I cried as I fell down, down, down. 

“Whoa!” 

I slid down a long wooden chute and landed— thunk !—on some kind of 
mattress. 

I lay on my back in a daze. I heard water dripping somewhere. A dim 
yellow light flickered from a bare bulb on the ceiling. 

I sat up, gazing around me. The room was nearly empty, dark and damp, 
with a cement floor. I spotted a furnace in the corner. 

I’m in the basement of Midnight Mansion, I realized. 

I stood up and examined the chute. So that’s how the trick works, I thought. 
Amaz-0 sets up his spinning box over a trap door in the floor of the stage. The 
bottom of the box drops out, and the volunteer slides down the chute and out of 
sight. When Amaz-0 opens the door of the box— presto !—the volunteer has 
disappeared. It’s so simple. 

But how do I get back upstairs? I wondered. How will Amaz-0 make me 
reappear? 

Muffled applause drifted down from overhead. I could hear Amaz-O’s 
voice, faintly. “Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I must be going 
now. I’ve got to disappear into the fifth dimension and find that boy! Good 
night!” 

The audience laughed. Then I heard music, an explosion, and loud 
clapping. 

Amaz-0 must have made himself disappear, I thought. He’ll probably come 
sliding down this chute any minute. 

I waited. 

No one came sliding down the chute. 

I waited a few more minutes. 

Nothing. 



He must have disappeared some other way, I figured. 

He’ll show up soon, I thought. He’ll come and let me out of here. And then 
I’ll ask him how he does that trick with the alarm clock. Maybe he’ll even give 
me his autograph! 

A few minutes later I heard chairs scraping across the floor upstairs and a 
stampede of footsteps. The show was over. The audience was leaving. 

Is somebody going to let me out of here? I wondered. I was getting a little 
nervous. I sat down on the mattress to wait. 

What’s taking Amaz-0 so long? 

Maybe he wants to wait until everyone is gone, so no one will figure out 
how he did the trick. That must be it. 

I waited a little longer. I heard a rustling, scuttling noise. A rat! I thought, 
jumping up off the mattress. I stared at the floor, watching for the rat. 

The noise stopped. 

Maybe it wasn’t a rat, I thought, trying to calm myself. My muscles were all 
tense. Maybe it was only a mouse. Or a cockroach. Or my imagination. 

The drip, drip, drip of the water somewhere in the basement was starting to 
drive me crazy. Drip, drip, drip. Like some kind of water torture. 

Where is Amaz-O? When is he going to let me out of here? 

I listened for signs of life upstairs. Nothing. Everything was silent up there 

now. 

Okay, I said to myself. Everyone is gone. You can let me out now, Amaz-O. 

I listened hard. I didn’t hear anyone in the building. 

What if Amaz-O is gone, too? I thought, panicking. What if he forgot about 
me and left me here? 

I’ve got to find a way out myself, I decided. 

I crept across the cement floor, keeping an eye out for rats. 

It sure is dark down here, I thought. 

I drifted toward the dripping sound and found myself in a room with a big 
laundry sink. I crossed the laundry room. On the other side I found a steep flight 
of steps leading to a door at the top. 

Aha, I thought, feeling better now. A way out. 

I climbed the rickety stairs. I reached for the doorknob and pushed. 

The door didn’t open. I turned the knob again and pulled. 

Nothing. 

The door was locked! 



I rattled the door as hard as I could. I pounded on it with my fists. 
“Let me out of here!” I cried. “Can anyone hear me? 

“Let me out of here!” 



11 


“Hey!” I shouted. I rattled the door. “Somebody! Get me out of here!” 

How could Amaz-0 do this? I thought angrily. How could he forget all 
about me like this? 

He wouldn’t lock me in the basement on purpose—would he? 

No, I told myself. Why would he want to do that? 

It’s all just a big mistake. 

I shook the door again. It loosened a little. I pushed on it, and it opened a 
crack. 

The door was bolted from the outside with a metal hook. But the hook 
wasn’t secure. 

I’ll bet I can break the door open, I realized. 

I backed partway down the stairs. Then I ran to the top and threw myself 
against the door. 

“Ow!” I grunted. The door loosened a little more. But it didn’t open. And 
now my shoulder ached. 

Then I thought the unthinkable. I couldn’t believe I was thinking this—but I 
sure wished Ginny were with me. 

She could’ve karate-kicked through that door in about five seconds. I know, 
because she’s kicked her way into my bedroom lots of times. 

Where is Ginny, anyway? I thought. She must be outside in the parking lot, 
waiting for me. 

I had to try again. I rammed my shoulder against the door as hard as I 
could. 

Bang! The hook broke, and the door flew open. 

Excellent, I thought, rubbing my shoulder. I’m out of that horrible basement 
at last. 

But where am I now? 

A long, dark corridor. 

“Hello?” I called. No answer. “Hello?” 

Where is everybody? I wondered. Shouldn’t there be stagehands bustling 
around or something? 



I tiptoed down the hall. The place appeared deserted. 

How could they have left me down in the basement like that? I thought 
angrily. How could they leave me here alone—and just go home? 

At the end of the hall I saw a sliver of light. It came from under a door. 

Someone’s still here, I realized. Maybe it’s Amaz-O! 

I crept down the hall. The door had a star on it. It must be Amaz-O’s 
dressing room! I thought. This is fantastic! I’m alone in Midnight Mansion with 
the great Amaz-O! We’ll probably stay up all night talking about magic. If I 
could get him to show me a few of his secrets... 

I felt so excited and nervous my hands shook. I almost forgot about being 
left in the basement. 

That was just a mistake, I thought. A stagehand forgot to come get me. 
Amaz-O must have thought I was all right. He’ll probably be really glad to see 
me. 

I stared at the star on the door. What should I do? I wondered. Should I 
knock? Should I call out his name? 

I’ll knock, I decided. I stepped to the door. Thunk! I tripped over something 
propped against the wall. A large black case with PROPERTY OF AMAZ-O 
written on the side. 

Wow, I thought, running my fingers along the gold letters. This must be 
Amaz-O’s magic kit! I’m touching it with my own hands! 

I turned back to the door. I was about to meet my idol, my all-time hero. It 
was the biggest moment of my life. 

I reached for the door. My hand trembled. I knocked lightly. 

I waited. 

Maybe he didn’t hear me, I thought. I knocked again, harder this time. 

Nothing. 

“Hello?” I called softly, peeking into the room. Amaz-O’s big white rabbit 
perched on the couch. 

Amaz-O sat on a chair across from the rabbit. I could see his legs. 

“Hello?” I called again. “It’s me. From the disappearing act. Can I come 

in?” 

I paused at the door. Amaz-O didn’t answer me. Suddenly the door 
slammed shut in my face! 

“Hey!” I cried in surprise. 

A voice growled at me from the other side. “Beat it!” 



“But—I’m your biggest fan! I’d just like to shake hands—” 
“Beat it!” the voice snarled again. “Beat it, punk!” 



12 


Punk? Punk? 

Did the great Amaz-0 call me a punk? 

I couldn’t believe it. I stood staring at the star on the door in shock. 

How could Amaz-0 talk to me this way? After I volunteered for his 
disappearing trick—and he left me locked in the basement! 

What’s his problem, anyway? 

For a few seconds I couldn’t move. I couldn’t think. My hero had called me 
a punk. The greatest magician in the world—and he turned out to be a big fat 
jerk! 

Okay, so he wasn’t fat. But he was the biggest jerk I’d ever met in my 
whole life. 

I hung my head and turned away from the door to leave. Then I saw it again 
—the big black case. 

Amaz-O’s magic kit. 

Without thinking, I grabbed the case and ran. 

It was heavy and awkward, but I lugged it down the hall as quickly and 
quietly as I could. 

Why am I doing this? I wondered as I burst into the stage area. 

I’m still not sure why I did it. I’d gone through so much trouble to get to the 
show—sneaking out of the house to meet Amaz-O. And then he was so mean to 
me. Maybe I wanted to get back at him. 

It doesn’t matter why I did it. I did it. I stole Amaz-O’s magic tricks. 

In the back of my mind, I knew I was headed for trouble. 

I paused near the stage. Was Amaz-0 following me? I listened. 

Not a sound. No one coming. I swallowed hard and started running again. 

I passed under the chandelier in the lobby and burst through the front door. 
I hope Amaz-0 was the last person in the club, I thought. I hope there aren’t any 
guards lurking around. 

I didn’t have time to check. I dragged the case across the gravel parking lot 
toward my bike. 

Almost there, I told myself, panting. The parking lot was empty now. The 
floodlights that lit up the mansion were off. The old house lay hidden in 



darkness. 

It must be really late, I thought. I’d better hurry home. 

My bike stood where I’d left it, leaning against a rail. 

I was reaching for the handlebars when a voice called “Stop 
I froze. 

I knew I was caught. 



13 


I heard heavy footsteps crunch toward me across the gravel parking lot. 

Here they come, I thought. They’ve caught me red-handed with Amaz-O’s 
bag. They’ll probably arrest me. 

“Where were you?” the voice called. 

Ginny! I’d completely forgotten about her. Oops. 

“Why are you leaving without me?” she demanded. 

“Wh-why?” I stammered. What could I say? I didn’t want to admit I’d 
forgotten all about her. “I-I wasn’t leaving without you. I was looking for you. 
Where have you been?” 

“Looking for you, Tim,” she snapped. “What happened to you? You 
disappeared—and you never came back!” 

“It’s a long story,” I said. 

She leaned forward to read the lettering on Amaz-O’s black case. 
“'Property of Amaz-O.’ Where did you get that?” 

“He gave it to me,” I lied. “Wasn’t that nice of him?” 

She reached out to open the clasp that held the case shut. “Cool. What’s 
inside?” 

I stopped her hand. “I’ll show it to you when we get home. It’s filled with 
tricks. Amaz-0 said I could keep it. He was grateful to me for being such a good 
sport in the disappearing act.” 

Ginny looked puzzled. “If Amaz-0 gave you that case,” she began, “why 
are those guards running this way?” 

I glanced toward the mansion. Two guards charged across the parking lot, 
waving flashlights. Uh-oh. 

I grabbed the case. “Let’s get out of here!” I cried. “Quick—get on your 
bike. Let’s ride!” 

“I can’t!” Ginny cried. 

“Huh? Why not?” 

“My bike is gone!” 



14 


I jumped on my bike. “Too bad!” I cried. “See you at home!” 

“Tim!” Ginny wailed. “You can’t leave me here!” 

I would have left her there if I could. She can take care of herself. But I 
knew Mom and Dad would kill me. 

Besides, when the guards caught her, she’d tell on me. I’d still get in 
trouble. 

I sat on my bike, watching the guards run right for us. Then I spotted her 
bike on the edge of the parking lot. “It’s over there!” I told her. “Hurry!” 

She raced to her bike. I balanced the case on top of my handlebars. It wasn’t 

easy. 

“Stop!” a guard yelled. Ginny and I sped out of the parking lot and down 
the dark street. 

“Hey—stop!” the guards shouted. The beams of their flashlights blinded me 
for a second. I pedaled as hard as I could. Ginny darted ahead of me. 

I clutched the black case with one hand and steered with the other. The case 
slowed me down. The guards were gaining on us. At the first corner I zoomed 
left. Ginny followed. 

I glanced back. The guards had stopped running. One of them bent over, 
panting. 

“They’ll never catch us now!” Ginny shouted. We hiked home as fast as we 
could. The streets were empty and really dark. The lights were out in most of the 
houses. 

It’s after midnight, I realized. Please let Mom and Dad be asleep. If they 
catch us, they’ll ground us till we’re thirty-five! I’d almost rather be arrested. 

But then, if I got arrested, Mom and Dad would still ground me. 

We braked at our street and walked our bikes into the driveway. 

“Sshhh,” Ginny whispered. 

“Sshhh yourself,” I whispered back. 

We parked the bikes in the garage. It was hard to see without the lights on. 
On the way into the house, Ginny tripped over the lawn mower. 

“Ow!” she yelped. 

“Quiet!” I snapped. 



We both froze. Did Mom and Dad hear us? 

Silence. “I think it’s okay,” I whispered. 

“That hurt,” Ginny whined. 

“Ssshhhh!” 

We sneaked into the house. “Til hide the case in my room,” I whispered. 

“I want to look at it now,” Ginny protested. 

I shook my head. “It’s mine.” 

“No, it’s not. You have to share it with me.” 

“Amaz-0 gave it to me,” I insisted, even though it wasn’t exactly true. 

“I’m going to tell Mom and Dad,” Ginny threatened. “I’ll tell them you 
woke me up and forced me to go with you to Midnight Mansion.” 

“You little brat!” I cried angrily. Stupid Ginny. “Okay, I’ll share it with 
you.” 

“Promise?” 

“If you promise not to tell Mom and Dad.” 

“I promise. But you can’t keep the case in your room. It’s both of ours 
now.” 

I sighed. “All right. I’ll hide it in the attic. Okay?” 

She nodded. 

“But we won’t touch it until Saturday,” I said. “On Saturday, we’ll have 
plenty of time to try everything out and do it right. Deal?” 

“Deal. On Saturday we’ll both open the case, at the same time, together. ” 

“Right. Now go to bed. I’ll sneak it up to the attic.” 

We tried to be careful going up the creaky stairs. It took us about ten 
minutes. At the top I paused to listen for sounds from Mom and Dad’s room. 

“Everything is okay,” Ginny whispered. “Dad is snoring.” 

She crept into her room and shut the door. I tiptoed up to the attic, lugging 
the black case. 

I shut the attic door and switched on the light. Where can I hide this? I 
wondered, gazing around at all the junk. I stepped over piles of old magazines. 
In one corner sat my old toy chest. 

Perfect, I thought, opening the chest. I pulled out a toy school bus and a 
couple of trucks to make room for the case. 

What’s in here, anyway? I wondered as I hefted Amaz-O’s case. I held 
Amaz-O’s magic kit in my hands. How could I go to sleep without seeing what’s 
in it? How could I wait two whole days until Saturday? 



Maybe I’ll take a little peek inside, I thought. Just a quick one. Then I’ll go 
to bed. 

I set the case on the floor. My hands trembled as I fumbled with the clasp. 
Here goes, I thought, tugging open the clasp. I pulled the case open— 

And it blew up in my face! 



15 


I fell over backwards. I lay sprawled on the floor, covering my eyes. 

What happened? 

Am I dead? 

I opened my eyes. I squeezed my arms. I grabbed my chest. 

I’m okay, I realized. 

I sat up. The case sat on the floor. No signs of an explosion. 

Carefully I crawled over to the case. I could have sworn it had blown up. 
But I didn’t see anything that would blow up. 

Then, taped to the inside of the top flap, I saw a little metal disk. I tapped it. 
It made a muffled roar. 

I examined the metal disk. It was an electronic chip. It made an explosion 
sound effect when I shook it or tapped it. 

Just one of Amaz-O’s tricks. 

What else is in here? I wondered. 

I pulled out all kinds of cool stuff. A pair of trick handcuffs. A pocket watch 
for hypnotizing people. Three different decks of trick cards. A rope. And a long 
chain of silk scarves tied together. 

I wonder how all this stuff works, I thought. I’ll have to fool around with it 
on Saturday and figure it out. 

I found a small black sack that held three oval shells and a little red ball. 
The shell game, I realized. One of my favorite tricks. You hide the ball under one 
of the shells and shift them around. The audience has to guess which shell the 
ball is under. 

They always guess wrong, because the ball isn’t under any of the shells. 
The magician secretly palms the ball while he’s shifting the shells around. 

Gets ’em every time. 

I reached into the case again. My hand brushed against something silky. I 
pulled it out. It was a black tuxedo jacket. 

“Wow!” I gasped. “Amaz-O’s own jacket!” 

I had to try it on. I pulled it over my shoulders. It was too big. The 
shoulders drooped halfway down my arms, and the sleeves covered my hands. 

But it felt great. I ran my hands over the satin lapels. 



I stood up and walked around in it. A real magician’s jacket. I wonder what 
he’s got in the pockets? 

I stuck my hands in the pockets. But suddenly I felt something wiggle. 
Along the back of the jacket, near my neck. 

I shook my shoulders. The wiggling stopped. 

But then I felt it again. Something came sliding down the sleeve! 

I shook my arm. What is it? I thought. Is it alive? 

The thing crawled along my arm. “Yuck!” I sputtered. “Get off me!” I 
squirmed inside the coat, trying to shake the thing off. 

I had to get the jacket off—right away! I struggled to get my arms out of the 
sleeves. 

Then something poked its head out. Out of the sleeve, near my hand. 

A snake. 

Alive snake. 



16 


I clamped my mouth shut to keep from screaming. The snake felt warm and 
creepy against my arm. I shook my arm hard. The snake clung to me! 

I gritted my teeth and shook my arm again. And again. I brushed at my 
sleeve with my free hand. 

It wasn’t working! 

I shook my arm once more, as hard as I could. The snake uncoiled and 
slithered out of the sleeve. It dropped to the floor. 

It hissed and curved around the toy chest. I watched it with a shiver. 

Then I felt it again—that slippery, wriggling feeling. Something hissed near 
my ear and squirmed across my shoulder. 

“Ohhh!” I moaned. Another snake! I slapped at it. “Get off me!” 

As I tried to brush the snake away, another one slithered down my sleeve. 
Something slimy wriggled across my stomach and down my back. A snake 
popped out of an inner pocket and plopped to the floor. It started to coil around 
my leg. 

The jacket is crammed with snakes! I realized with horror. 

I thrashed my arms, frantically trying to tear off the jacket. A snake slid 
down the front of my shirt. 

I thrashed harder, shaking my arms and legs. Now I was covered with 
snakes! My whole body! 

I wanted to scream—but I couldn’t wake Mom and Dad. A snake curled up 
my neck and around my head. I squirmed, desperately trying to get out of the 
jacket. 

“Help!” I moaned. “Ohhhh—help!” 



17 


Snakes everywhere! 

One slithered over my head. With a trembling hand, I grabbed at it and 
heaved it away. 

Gasping in terror, I struggled out of the jacket. I tossed it on the floor. 
Snakes wriggled over it. Snakes wriggled over my feet. I hopped up and down. 
Then I hopped onto a chair. A snake coiled up the leg of the chair. It crept closer. 
“Go away!” I whispered. “Leave me alone!” 

The snake hissed. I jumped off the chair. 

Squish! My stomach turned. Did I step on a snake? I was afraid to look. 

I lifted my foot and glanced down. I hadn’t stepped on a snake. It was one 
of Ginny’s old dolls. 

A snake slid over the doll’s face and around its neck. Another snake 
slithered over my shoe. 

There’s no escape! I realized. I’ve got no choice—I have to wake up Mom 
and Dad. What else can I do? 

I hopped around the squirming, hissing snakes. 

I’ll get into trouble, I thought. But at least I’ll be out of this snake pit! 

A snake darted toward me—then suddenly froze. The room fell silent. No 
more hissing. 

All around me the snakes stopped moving. They lay stiff on the floor. Their 
cold eyes stared. 

What happened? Were they dead? 

I glanced around, afraid to move. The floor was littered with dead snakes. 

How could they all die at once? I wondered. It’s so weird! 

I stood there, not moving a muscle. My eyes darted around the room. 

I slowly reached out my leg and tapped one of the snakes with my foot. It 
jiggled a little. 

I took a deep breath. Should I touch it? 

I got up the courage to bend close to the snake. I stuck out a finger and 
poked at it. Nothing happened. My heart pounded. I picked up the snake. 

It lay limp in my hand. It didn’t seem real. 



I twisted the body. It was rubber! I examined the eyes. They were made of 
glass. 

They’re mechanical snakes, I realized. 

I turned the snake over. I found a tiny wind-up key hidden under a rubber 

flap. 

Amaz-O’s jacket was rigged with wind-up snakes. 

I began to breathe again. Everything is okay, I told myself. I don’t have to 
wake up Mom and Dad. I’m not going to get into trouble. I’m not going to be 
eaten alive by snakes. 

When will I learn? I scolded myself. All of these things are just tricks. None 
of them is real. Amaz-0 is a magician. 

I gathered up the snakes and stuffed them back inside the jacket. Then I 
jammed the jacket into Amaz-O’s magic kit. I took one last look inside the bag. 

This is amazing, I thought. I’ve got some of Amaz-O’s best tricks—right 
here in my own house! 

I forced myself to close the kit. I’d better stop fooling around with this 
stuff, I thought—before anything else happens! 

I’ll check it all out on Saturday. In daylight, when I have plenty of time to 
see how it all works. 

Then I’ll give the kit back to Amaz-O. On Monday. 

I knew I had to return the kit. It had been wrong to take it. And crazy. 

If only Amaz-0 hadn’t been so mean to me! He used me in his act—and 
then he locked me in the basement! He told me to get lost. He called me a punk! 

I started to get angry all over again. Amaz-0 doesn’t deserve to get his 
magic kit back, I thought. 

But deep down I knew I had to return it. I wanted to do the right thing. I’d 
check out the tricks, then give them back. 

Of course, I didn’t know then how dangerous the kit was. I didn’t know the 
trouble it would cause. 

If I had known, I would have returned the case that night!

“Another day of work,” Mom sighed at the breakfast table the next morning. 
“I’m absolutely dreading it. Those students just drive me crazy.” 

Dad grabbed a doughnut and gazed out the window. “It’s raining,” he said 
unhappily. “I probably won’t sell a single car today.” 

Ginny and I exchanged glances. Mom and Dad had no idea we had sneaked 
out the night before. 

I slumped into a chair and ate my cereal. I was sleepy. I’m not used to 
staying up so late. 

“You look tired, Tim,” Mom said, sitting across from me. She glanced at 
Ginny. “So do you, honey.” 

“Didn’t you two get any sleep?” Dad asked. 

“Sure we did,” I replied. 

Ginny grinned. “Not that much sleep. Tim and I have a secret!” 

The little brat! I kicked her under the table. 

“Ow!” she cried. “Tim kicked me!” 

“Don’t kick your sister,” Dad scolded. “I have to leave.” He picked up his 
briefcase and kissed Mom good-bye. “Off to another day of torture. See you 
tonight, kids.” 

Dad left. Mom started clearing away the breakfast dishes. “Did you say 
something about a secret?” she asked. 

“No!” I insisted. “Ginny didn’t say anything about a secret. She said, 'Tim 
and I want a wee pet.’” 

Mom shot me a weird look. “A what? A wee pet?” 

“Yeah,” I said. “You know, a little pet. A nice little kitten or something. 
Ginny’s learning about Scotland in school now. She’s picked up some Scottish 
words, right, Ginny? She’s been running around calling everything ‘wee’.” 

“I have not,” Ginny protested. “I’ve never called anything ‘wee’ in my life! 
And I’m not learning about Scotland in school!” 

“Yes, you are, ” I insisted. 

“What in the world are you two talking about?” Mom carried the pile of 
cereal bowls to the sink. 

“We did a bad thing, Mom,” Ginny blurted out. “Ow!” I kicked her again, 



but that didn’t stop her. 

“We sneaked out last night, Mom. We rode our bikes to Midnight Mansion 
to see the magic show. We didn’t get back until after midnight. I’m sorry, Mom. 
Please don’t get angry. Tim made me do it. I didn’t want to.” 

I covered my face with my hands. Why does Ginny have to be such a big 
mouth? 

I’m doomed, I thought. Doomed! 



19 


“What did you say, Ginny?” Mom asked, wiping her hands on a towel. “I was 
running water in the sink, and I couldn’t hear you.” 

I let out a long breath. I couldn’t believe my luck. I glared at Ginny and 
kicked her again—really hard this time. 

“Nothing, Mom,” Ginny murmured. “I didn’t say anything.” 

“You two better get ready for school,” Mom said. 

I pushed my chair away from the table and dragged Ginny out of hers. 
“We’ll be ready in a minute, Mom,” I said. 

“What is your problem?” I whispered to Ginny in the hall. “You could’ve 
gotten us in big trouble!” 

“You would get in trouble. Not me,” Ginny replied. “You’re the big brother. 
You made me go.” 

“I didn’t make you do anything. And anyway, you promised not to tell!” 

“You promised not to peek into Amaz-O’s kit until Saturday,” Ginny 
reminded me. “But I sneaked up to the attic this morning—and I know you 
looked! You opened that bag! You even played with some of the stuff!” 

“Me? I did not!” I lied. 

“Yes, you did. One of the sleeves of a jacket was sticking out of the kit. 
And I found a scarf on the floor. You big fat liar!” 

“So what? You’ll still get to see the stuff on Saturday.” 

“You promised,” Ginny repeated. She flicked my nose. “Boi-oi-oing.” 

I stormed into my room. There’s no arguing with Ginny. She does whatever 
she wants—promise or no promise. 

She’s always getting me into trouble, I thought angrily. She drives me 
crazy! I wish there were some way I could pay her back. Some way to pay her 
back for everything. 

Little did I realize I would soon find it. 



20 


“Are you sure you kids don’t want to go to the antiques show with us?” Dad 
asked. “You might see some neat old junk there.” 

“We’re sure,” I insisted. Saturday morning had arrived, and all I could think 
about was Amaz-O’s magic kit. I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it. 

I wished my parents would hurry up and leave. 

“All right,” Mom said, kissing Ginny and then me. “There’s tuna salad in 
the fridge for lunch. We won’t be back until dinnertime.” 

“Be good,” Dad added. 

“I'll be good,” Ginny declared. “I don’t know about Tim. ” 

I tried to shove her, but she dodged me. “I’ll be good,” I promised. “I’m 
always good.” 

Mom rolled her eyes. “Just don’t fight too much,” she said. “’Bye.” 

Ah. At last. As soon as they were gone, I raced to the phone and dialed 
Foz’s number. 

“The coast is clear,” I told him. “Come on over.” 

I’d told Foz all about the show at Midnight Mansion and Amaz-O’s magic 
kit. He begged me to let him see the cool tricks in Amaz-O’s bag. 

As soon as Foz arrived, we all trooped up to the attic. Ginny made a beeline 
for the magic kit. I blocked her. 

“Heee-ya!” She leaped into a pre-karate chop stance. “Out of my way!” 

“Ginny—wait!” I pleaded. “There’s a lot of weird stuff in that bag. Let me 
show it to you my way.” 

“Okay.” She relaxed. “But don’t forget you’re supposed to share it with 

me.” 

I pulled up two chairs. “You guys sit here,” I said to Ginny and Foz. “And 
get ready for the greatest magic show in the history of the world!” 

I reached into the toy chest and pulled out Amaz-O’s magic kit. I held it up 
in front of Foz and Ginny. “First,” I began in my magician voice, “gaze deeply 
into the magic trove.” 

I held the bag near their faces. They stared at it. I yanked it open. 

Kaboom! It made the exploding sound, just as it did the first time I opened 
it. 



Ginny and Foz fell off their chairs! 

“What happened?” Foz moaned, clutching his head. “That thing blew up in 
my face!” 

I cracked up. “It’s only a sound effect,” I explained. 

“Not funny,” Ginny complained. 

“You should have seen your faces,” I said gleefully. I reached into the black 
sack that held the three shells and the red ball. I set the shells in a row on a small 
table. 

“Watch closely,” I said. I held up the red ball. “See this ball? I’ll place it 
under one of these shells.” I pretended to tuck the ball under the middle shell. 
But secretly I palmed the ball and flicked it up my sleeve. 

I began moving the shells over the table, shifting their places. 

“Keep your eyes on the middle shell,” I instmcted. Then I stopped moving 
the shells. 

“Which shell is the ball under?” I asked. 

“That one,” Ginny said, pointing to the shell on the right. 

“Are you sure?” I prompted. “Foz, where do you think the ball is?” 

“The same one as Ginny,” he said. “I watched it the whole time.” 

“If you say so,” I said. I was sure the ball wasn’t under that shell—it wasn’t 
under any of them. I felt the ball rubbing against my wrist. 

I lifted the shell—and gasped. There was a ball under there. A red ball, just 
like the one I’d palmed. 

“I was right!” Ginny crowed. “That’s a stupid trick.” 

“But this is impossible!” I cried. I let the first ball fall out of my sleeve. I 
had palmed it. 

“This is very strange,” I muttered. “Let me try again.” 

I dropped the first ball on the floor. I picked up the second ball and 
pretended to slip it under a different shell. I palmed the ball and tucked it up my 
sleeve again. 

“Here we go,” I said, shifting the shells all over the table. I slid the shells 
around a little longer, then stopped. 

“The ball is under the first shell,” Foz said. 

“Yes, the first shell,” Ginny agreed. 

“This time you’re wrong!” I cried. I lifted the first shell. Another red ball! 

Ginny sneered. “You’re a real ace, Tim.” 

“Wait a second,” I said. I lifted up the other two shells. All three of them 



had red balls under them! 

“This isn’t working at all,” I grumbled. I set the shells down, then lifted 
them again. More balls! There were now three balls under each shell! 

“This isn’t the shell game I know.” I was mystified. “This must be some 
other trick.” 

“It’s way better than your dumb trick,” Ginny said. “Those balls are coming 
out of nowhere!” 

The shells began to dance as balls bubbled out of them like popcorn. Ten 
balls. Twenty balls. 

Little red balls covered the table and bounced to the floor. 

“They’re still coming!” Foz cried in amazement. “We’re going to be up to 
our necks in red balls!” 

“How do I stop this thing?” I wondered. 

Can I stop it? 



21 


I snatched up the shells and tossed them into their black sack. Then I grabbed all 
the red balls I could and stuffed them in, too. 

“Help me, you guys!” I pleaded. 

Ginny and Foz fell to their knees, gathering up red balls. We shoved them 
all into the sack. I pulled the string that closed it and dropped it into the magic 
kit. 

The black sack kept bubbling. Red balls started bursting out of it. 

“Stop that!” I yelled. I reached into the magic case and pulled out the first 
thing I touched. Then I snapped the case shut. 

“I don’t really get that trick,” Ginny complained. 

“Here’s another trick,” I said. “This one will be better.” In my hand I held a 
flattened top hat. “Let’s see what this does.” 

I punched the top hat open and placed it on my head. 

“It’s just a hat,” Foz said, fidgeting. “It’s kind of hot up here. Can we go 
down to the kitchen and get something to eat?” 

“You guys don’t get it,” I said. “This is Amaz-O’s magic case! Okay, so I 
don’t know how anything works yet. Once we figure it out, we could put on the 
best magic show ever! I could become a famous magician!” 

“And I could be a famous magician’s sister.” Ginny yawned. “Big deal.” 

“That hat looks way cool on you,” Foz said. “Now can we get something to 

eat?” 

“I’m hungry, too,” Ginny added. 

“Wait!” I cried. I felt something move under the hat. I whipped it off. 

“A white dove!” Foz cried. 

“That’s a good trick,” Ginny admitted. 

I shook the dove off my head. “How do you get it back in the hat?” I asked. 
Before I had a chance to try, another dove popped out of the hat. 

I set the second dove on the floor. “There’s another one!” Foz shouted. 

A third dove flew out of the hat and settled on top of an old lamp. Out 
popped a fourth, and a fifth... 

Foz started laughing. “These tricks are totally out of control!” 



“This is no joke, Foz!” I snapped. 

“We’re going to be in major trouble,” Ginny warned. “We’ve got to find a 
way to get rid of these birds!” 

The attic was quickly filling up with flapping, fluttering doves—and they 
kept coming. I knew we had to get rid of them—but how? 

“Maybe there’s something in here that will help.” I ripped open the magic 
case. Kaboom! It made that stupid exploding sound again. Dozens of little red 
balls flew into my face. 

“I’m really getting sick of this,” I muttered. 

I brushed away piles of balls. I pulled out a long black stick with a white 
tip. A magic wand! 

“Maybe this will help!” I cried. I hoped it would. The attic was a total mess 
—white doves and red balls everywhere. 

“This is the answer,” I declared. “Amaz-0 probably uses this wand to make 
the magic stop.” 

“I hope you’re right,” Ginny said. “If that doesn’t work, you and I are going 
to have to run away from home.” 

“It’ll work,” I insisted. “It’s got to.” 

I waved the wand in the air. “Stop!” I shouted. “Everything stop!” 



22 


Did it work? 

No. 

More doves flew out of the hat. More red balls bubbled out of the black 

sack. 

“That magic wand is the only thing in there that doesn’t work!” Foz joked. 

“Be quiet!” I snapped. “I’ve got to think!” 

“Yikes!” Ginny screamed. “A snake!” 

She pointed at the magic case. A snake slithered out of it. Then a second, a 

third. 

The mechanical snakes had come back to life! 

Hissing snakes soon covered the floor, wriggling over the bouncing red 
balls. Dove feathers fell from the ceiling. The attic was so crowded I could 
hardly see across the room. 

Ginny yelped as a snake began to crawl up her leg. “Let’s get out of here!” 
she cried. 

She yanked open the attic door. She and Foz hurried downstairs. I grabbed 
the magic case and followed them. A snake slithered after me. 

“Get back in there!” I yelled. I picked up the snake and threw it into the 
attic room. I shut the door. I pushed on it to make sure it was closed. Then I ran 
downstairs and out to the backyard. 

A gust of March wind slapped my face. Ginny’s long hair flew out behind 
her. 

“Snakes—ick!” she squealed. “Tim—what are we going to do? When Mom 
and Dad see the attic, we’re dead meat!” 

Foz stared at the magic case. “What did you bring that out for? It’s 
dangerous!” 

“It’s okay if we stay outside,” I told him. “So what if a bunch of birds 
comes out? They’ll fly away.” 

I wasn’t as sure about that as I sounded. But I couldn’t give Amaz-O’s case 
back without seeing everything in it first. I just couldn’t. 

“Hurry up, Tim,” Ginny whined. “I’m starving. It’s lunchtime!” 

“Wait. Wait.” I opened the magic case. Ka-boom! It didn’t sound so loud 



outside—especially with the wind blowing as hard as it was. 

I held the magic wand poised between my fingers. What does this thing do? 
I wondered. 

I waved it around, trying out new magician names. “The Great Incredible- 
O. Mister Terrifico—that’s not bad. Get out of there, Ginny!” She was 
rummaging through the magic kit. 

“You promised we’d share it, remember?” she snapped. Then her face 
brightened. “Hey! Great!” 

She pulled a carrot out of Amaz-O’s bag. “Just what I needed—something 
to eat.” 

“Put that back!” I ordered. 

“It’s still fresh,” she said. “Yum!” 

She opened her mouth, ready to bite the carrot. 

“Ginny—no!” I cried. “Maybe you shouldn’t eat that. Maybe—” 

Ginny never listens to me. 

She crunched down on the carrot. 

A flash of white light blinded me for a moment. 

When my eyes focused, I saw the most amazing thing I’d ever seen in my 


life! 



23 


The carrot dropped to the grass. Ginny’s nose twitched. Then she began to 
shrink. 

As she shrank, her hair turned from blond to white. Her nose turned pink. 
White fur and whiskers sprouted from her face. She grew smaller, furrier, 
whiter.... 

“I don’t believe it!” Foz gasped. “Your sister—she’s a rabbit!” 

Ginny sat on the grass, twitching her little pink nose. She stared at me with 
her rabbity eyes. She waved her little paws and made angry, rabbity noises. 

“Man, she is steamed! ” Foz cried. 

I was stunned. “I wished it,” I murmured. “And now it’s come true.” 

“What are you talking about?” Foz demanded. He grabbed me by the 
shoulders. “Get it together, Tim. We’ve got to do something! What’s going to 
happen when your parents get home?” 

“I told Ginny I’d turn her into a rabbit,” I explained, still dazed. “To get 
back at her for ruining all my magic shows. And now she is a rabbit!” 

Ginny the rabbit rose on her hind legs, gesturing angrily at me. Then she 
bounced up and thumped my shin with one of her big rabbit feet. 

“Ow!” I cried. “That hurts as much as one of her karate kicks!” 

“Look in the kit, Tim,” Foz urged me. “There’s got to be some way to 
change her back.” 

“You’re right. There’s got to be!” My eyes fell on the carrot in the grass. 
“The carrot,” I said. “When Ginny bit it, she turned into a rabbit. But maybe if a 
rabbit bites it, it turns into a girl!” 

Foz shook his head. “Huh?” 

I snatched up the carrot. “We’ve got to try it. There’s nothing to lose, right? 
She’s already a rabbit. What else could happen to her?” 

I shoved the end of the carrot toward Ginny’s mouth. “Come on, Ginny. 
Take another bite.” 

She stared at the carrot suspiciously. She clamped her mouth shut and 
turned her face away. 

“You little brat!” I shouted. “You want me to get in trouble, don’t you! You 
want to stay a rabbit just to get me in trouble!” 



Foz grabbed the carrot out of my hand. “Calm down, Tim. You’re scaring 

her!” 

Ginny’s long rabbit ears perked up—she heard something. I heard it, too. A 
car coming. Pulling into the driveway! 

“Hurry, Ginny!” I cried. “I think Mom and Dad are home. Take a bite of the 
carrot. It’ll turn you back into a girl. I know it will!” 

Ginny eyed me suspiciously. She sniffed the carrot with her twitchy pink 

nose. 

“Hurry!” I shouted again. 

She opened her mouth and took a nibble of carrot. 

Foz and I watched her in a panic. “Please let it work,” I prayed. “Please let 
it work!” 



24 


Ginny’s rabbit nose twitched. Her ears stood straight up. Then they flopped 
down. 

Nothing happened. She was still a rabbit. 

“Mom and Dad!” I cried. “They’re here! Foz—stay with Ginny. If Mom 
and Dad ask, say she’s your sister’s rabbit!” 

I ran to the driveway. A car was backing out—not Mom and Dad. Just 
somebody turning around in our driveway. 

Whew. Close one. 

The wind gusted as I ran back to Foz and Ginny. Foz was on his knees, 
digging through the magic kit. Ginny hopped up and down impatiently. 

The magic wand lay in the grass. Maybe this will work now, I hoped, 
picking it up. I’ve got to change her back! 

I waved the wand over Ginny. “Turn my sister back into a girl!” I cried. 

Nothing. 

“Maybe you need to say the spell in a rhyme,” Foz suggested. “Magicians 
always do that.” 

“Okay.” I waved the wand again. “Let me think.... Magic wand, winds that 
whirl, turn Ginny back into a girl!” 

The wand began to shake. “Something’s happening!” I shouted. 

The white tip of the wand broke open. Out popped a white silk 
handkerchief. 

“Wow!” Foz gasped. A blue one flew out, then a red one, then a yellow one. 
The wind blew them away before I could catch them. 

I turned back to Ginny. Still a rabbit. 

“It didn’t work,” I said unhappily. I tossed the wand into the grass. “It only 
makes stupid handkerchiefs.” 

I crossed over to the magic case. Ginny leaped at me, trying to bite my leg. 

“Watch out!” I warned her. “I’m trying to help you!” 

She twitched her nose in disgust. 

Foz moved aside as I dove into the magic kit. I dumped everything out. A 
slip of paper tumbled out of a pocket in the case. 



I snatched it up. At the top of the paper I saw the word INSTRUCTIONS. 

“Look!” I cried. “Instructions!” I patted Ginny between the ears. “HI have 
you back to normal in a second.” 

I raised the paper to read what it said. “'Instructions. To use the magic top 
hat...’ No. That’s not what I need right now....” 

“Hurry, Tim!” Foz said. 

I scanned the paper, searching for anything about rabbits. “Here’s 
something!” I announced. “‘The magic carrot...’” 

Just then a strong gust of wind blasted across the yard. The paper flew out 
of my hands. 

“No!” I shouted, grasping for the paper. “I need that!” I watched helplessly 
as it flew out of my reach—high up into the sky. 



25 


“Get that paper!” I screamed. The wind blew it across the yard. I darted after it. 

Foz zoomed ahead of me, yelling, “I’ve got it! I’ve got it!” The paper 
floated within his reach. He dove for it. 

Whoosh! Another strong gust of wind. The paper fluttered away. Foz fell 
flat on his face. 

I ran past him, following the paper. It blew across my neighbor’s yard. 

“Get it!” Foz shouted, racing after me. “It’s headed for the woods!” 

The wind died for a minute. The paper settled on the grass. 

I pounced on it. But the wind picked up before I landed. The paper blew 
away again. 

“Rats! ” I cried. 

“There it goes!” Foz shouted. The paper drifted toward the stream. 

The paper floated above the stream, then landed in the water. Foz zipped 
across the yard to grab it. 

“Don’t let it get wet!” I screamed. 

Too late. The paper was soaked. 

“I’ve got it!” Foz shouted. He leaned over the stream and snatched at the 
paper. But the current carried it away. 

Foz and I chased it down the stream, panting. But we couldn’t run as fast as 
the current. 

“It’s getting away,” I huffed. A few seconds later we lost sight of it. 

Foz and I collapsed on the ground. 

“That’s it,” I groaned. “We’ll never get it back now. So how do I turn Ginny 
back into a girl?” 

Foz heaved himself to his feet and pulled me up by the hand. “Don’t panic, 
Tim. Panicking isn’t going to help.” 

Great advice. 

We hurried back to Ginny. I hoped maybe she’d magically turned back into 
a girl while we were gone. No such luck. 

Ginny knew we hadn’t found the instructions. She bounced around the yard, 
squealing angry rabbit squeals. 



Foz rubbed his short hair as he watched her. “Boy, she’s really stressed,” he 

said. 

I fell to my knees to talk to her. “Don’t worry, Ginny,” I soothed. “I’ve got 
an idea. I’m going to take you to Amaz-0 right now. He’ll turn you back into a 
girl. I’m sure he will.” 

With one of her long rabbit ears, Ginny flicked my nose. She couldn’t say 
“Boi-oi-oing.” She didn’t have to. I knew what she meant. 

“Let’s pick this stuff up,” I said to Foz. We began to gather all the tricks off 
the grass and pile them into Amaz-O’s magic case. “Amaz-0 won’t want to help 
us if I don’t give him back his magic kit.” 

Foz took my bike, balancing the magic kit on the handlebars. I picked up 
Ginny. “Come on, little rabbit sister,” I cooed. She let me pull her up by the back 
—then nipped me on the wrist! 

“Ow!” I dropped her. “Do you want me to help you or not?” 

She hopped up and down angrily. I knew what she was thinking. If I didn’t 
change her back into a girl, I’d be in as much trouble as she was. I had no 
choice. 

I reached for her again. “Don’t bite me this time,” I warned her. “Or I’ll put 
a muzzle over that little snout of yours.” 

She squirmed in my arms but didn’t bite. I set her in the basket on her bike. 

“To Midnight Mansion,” I told Foz. We set off, pedaling hard against the 
strong wind. 

I rode through town in a daze. Ginny’s long white ears waved in my face. 

Amaz-O’s words rang in my ears. “Beat it, punk!” he’d said. I wondered if 
he’d really help me. 

He’s got to, I told myself. He’ll be glad to get his magic kit back. 

I’ll make him help, I decided. I won’t give him the kit until he turns Ginny 
back into a girl. 

We pulled into the parking lot in front of Midnight Mansion. The old castle 
looked just as scary in the daytime as it did at night. There were no floodlights 
casting shadows on the stone towers. But the gray, vine-covered walls gave the 
place a spooky, abandoned feeling. 

I skidded to a stop in front of the mansion. Foz carried the magic kit. I 
grabbed Ginny out of the bike basket. 

“Behave,” I warned her as we climbed the front steps to the mansion. 
“Remember, I’m trying to help you. Don’t go biting me or anything.” 



She twitched her nose at me. She lifted her little rabbit lips and bared her 
tiny rabbit teeth. 

“Go ahead—bite me,” I whispered. “See how you like spending the rest of 
your life as a rabbit. You don’t even like lettuce!” 

She closed her mouth and twitched her nose again. It doesn’t matter 
whether she’s a girl or a rabbit, I thought. Either way she’s a pain in the neck. 

We stopped at the top of the steps. 

“Oh, no!” I gasped. “I don’t believe it!” 

The sign on the front door read SORRY, WE’RE CLOSED. 



26 


“No!” I cried. I banged my forehead against the door. 

Foz said, “This place gives me the creeps. It looks like Count Dracula’s 
castle.” He shivered. “Let’s get out of here.” 

He set the magic case down. “Amaz-O’s magic kit is so heavy. Do you 
think we can leave it by the door?” 

I glared at him. “No, we can’t leave it by the door. And we’re not going 
home. Not yet.” 

I squeezed Ginny in my arms, thinking. “Okay, so the place is closed. But 
Amaz-0 could be in there, rehearsing or something. Right?” 

“He could be, I guess,” Foz said. “But chances are—” 

“We’ve got to take that chance,” I insisted. I tried the front door. Locked. 
Of course. 

“There must be another way in,” I said. “A back door or something.” I 
dashed down the steps and around the side of the club. 

“Bring the case, Foz!” I ordered. 

He followed me, lugging the kit. I kept my eyes peeled for guards. 

At the back of the mansion we found a door. I tried it. It opened easily! 

We crept inside. We found ourselves in the club’s kitchen. It was long, 
narrow, and shiny clean. The lights were off, but we could see by the light from a 
window at one end. 

Foz paused in front of a huge, stainless steel refrigerator. “I’ll bet they’ve 
got some great food in here,” he whispered. “Lemon meringue pie or 
something.” 

I tugged at his arm. “This is no time for a snack!” I snapped. “Come on!” 

We left the kitchen and entered a long, dark hallway. I recognized that hall. 
It was the same hallway I’d walked down after my escape from the basement— 
the first time Amaz-0 let me down. 

“There’d better not be a second time,” I muttered under my breath. 

We tiptoed down the dark hall. Up ahead I saw the door to Amaz-O’s 
dressing room. It was half-open. A dim light spilled out into the hallway. 

Yes! I thought to myself. That’s a good sign. 

With Ginny in my arms, I crept up to the door. Please, please let him be in 



there, I prayed. Please be here, Amaz-O. Please help us. 
I stopped in front of the door. I took a deep breath. 
“Mr. Amaz-O? Are you here?” 



27 


No reply. 

I tried again. “Mr. Amaz-O? Hello?” 

“He’s not here,” Foz said. “Let’s go.” 

“Shhh!” I pushed the door open and crept into the dressing room. One small 
lamp cast a dim pool of light on the dressing table. The great Amaz-0 sat on the 
couch, his left side facing the door. He was staring at the wall. He didn’t seem to 
notice us. 

“Mr. Amaz-O?” I said politely. “It’s me again. The kid you made disappear 
in your magic show.” 

I thought Amaz-O would turn his head to face us now, but he didn’t. He 
didn’t do anything. He just sat there. 

Man, I thought. He really hates kids. Or he hates his fans. Or he hates all 
people. Or something. 

When I become a great magician, I vowed, I won’t be like Amaz-O. I won’t 
let my fame go to my head. I’ll be nice to people. This is ridiculous. 

I didn’t care what Amaz-O’s problem was. I needed his help—badly. And I 
wouldn’t give up until I got it. 

I stepped farther into the dressing room. “Mr. Amaz-O, I’m sorry to bother 
you. But I really need your help. It’s important.” 

Amaz-O didn’t move. He stared at the wall. Silent. 

“Do you think he’s asleep?” Foz whispered. 

I shrugged. I took another breath and crept closer to the couch. 

“I know you told me to beat it,” I said. “I wouldn’t bother you if it wasn’t a 
matter of life and death—I swear.” 

Still no response. I turned back to Foz, who cowered in the doorway. He 
looked as if he were ready to run for it. I waved him into the room. 

Foz stepped in. He set the magic kit on the floor, shaking. 

I stared at Amaz-O. He ignored me. Who does he think he is? I thought 
angrily. He can’t treat me this way! I’m not leaving until he helps me turn Ginny 
back into a girl. 

I steeled myself and approached the magician. He didn’t look at me. I 
tapped him on the shoulder. 



He toppled over onto his side. Thunk! 

Foz gasped. “Is he—? Is he—?” 

I peered at the body on the couch. “He isn’t alive!” I cried. “Amaz-0 isn’t 
alive!” 

“Oh, no!” Foz was wringing his hands in terror. “Oh, no! He’s dead! He’s 
dead! Help!” 

“He’s not dead,” I said. “He’s a dummy! 

“Amaz-0 is nothing but a big wooden puppet!” 



28 


How could it be possible? I stared at the puppet on the couch. I couldn’t resist 
touching its cheek—then pinching it—just to be sure. 

Oh, wow! 

It was true. Amaz-0 was made of wood. 

Foz sputtered, “But—I saw him on TV. He looked totally real.” 

“And I saw him live,” I said. “On stage. I stood right next to him, and he 
made me disappear!” 

How can this be? I wondered. How can the greatest magician in the world 
be a puppet? 

“This can’t be the guy you saw,” Foz insisted, poking at the dummy. “This 
is probably just a dummy he keeps around for fun. The real Amaz-0 has got to 
be around here somewhere.” 

Rabbit Ginny squirmed angrily in my arms. “Calm down,” I ordered, trying 
to pet her. 

She growled. I’ve never heard of a rabbit growling before. Only a Ginny- 
rabbit would growl. 

Amaz-O, my idol, I thought bitterly. What a fake he turned out to be. Not 
only was he a jerk to me—he’s not even a real person! He’s a puppet! 

“What are we going to do?” Foz asked. 

I shook my head. I had no idea. “Now I’ll never get Ginny changed back 
into a girl,” I said. “Mom and Dad are going to murder me.” 

“Why don’t you tell them she ran away?” Foz suggested. “They’ll never 
believe you turned her into a rabbit, anyway.” 

“Why would she run away?” I demanded. “She was their little darling. She 
could do no wrong. I’m the one who should run away.” 

Foz lifted the Amaz-0 puppet’s head, studying it. “I wonder how this thing 
works....” he said. 

Alow voice suddenly growled, “Hey, punk—I told you to beat it!” 

I froze. “Did you say something, Foz?” I asked. 

He shook his head, eyes wide. He’d heard the voice, too. 

“So beat it! Get out of here!” the voice growled. 

I glanced around the room. I didn’t see anyone. 



“Did the puppet talk?” I asked Foz. 

“I—I don’t think so,” he stammered. “The voice came from the other side 
of the room.” 

“The puppet didn’t talk, dummy,” the voice grumbled. I turned to find it. I 
gazed across the room. Amaz-O’s white rabbit sat on a chair in front of the 
dressing table. 

“I told you to get lost. Now get lost!” the rabbit growled. 

“Tim—did—did you see that?” Foz stammered. “I think that rabbit talked.” 

“Of course I talked, stupid,” the rabbit snarled. 

“You talked?” I echoed in amazement. 

“I guess that thing on the couch isn’t the only dummy in this room,” the 
rabbit snapped. “I can do lots of things. I’m a magician.” 

Foz and I stared at the rabbit, stunned. Even Ginny stopped squirming in 
my arms. 

“You’re not a magician,” Foz said. “You’re a rabbit.” 

The rabbit’s ears twisted. “Duh. You guys are really quick. You know that?” 

“You don’t have to be so mean,” I protested. 

“You don’t have to be so stupid,” the rabbit replied. “I may look like a 
rabbit. But so does your little sister. Am I right?” 

“He’s got a point,” Foz admitted. 

“I am the great Amaz-O,” the rabbit announced. “In person. That dummy 
on the couch is a puppet I had built to look like me—the old me.” 

My jaw fell open. “You’re Amaz-O? What happened to you?” 

The rabbit sighed. “It’s a long story. Let’s just say I had a rival—a real 
powerful one. A sorcerer, actually.” 

Foz gasped. “A sorcerer? Do they really exist?” 

“I’m telling you about one, aren’t I?” the rabbit shouted. 

“Yes, but—” 

“So be quiet and listen to the story,” Amaz-O, the rabbit, grumbled. “If 
you’d stop talking you might learn something.” 

Amaz-O sure was a grouch. 

“Anyway, long story short,” Amaz-O went on. “This sorcerer guy—Frank 

“A sorcerer named Frank?” I cut in. I didn’t mean to interrupt. It just 
slipped out. 

The rabbit glared at me. “Yes, a sorcerer named Frank. You got a problem 



with that?” 

I shook my head. 

“Can I finish talking now? You got any more stupid questions?” 

Foz and I both shook our heads. 

“This guy’s named Foz—” Amaz-0 gestured toward Foz “—and you want 
to make fun of a guy named Frank.” 

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I didn’t mean to make fun of Frank.” 

“He’s a very powerful guy,” Amaz-0 said. “I’m proof of that.” 

The rabbit hopped out of the chair, crossed the dressing room, and sat on 
the couch next to the dummy. 

“Here’s what happened,” he began. “I was at the height of my fame. I was 
the most brilliant magician in the world. I made appearances on all the top TV 
shows. I had millions of fans. Dopey little kids like you looked up to me.” 

“Hey!” I protested. “Stop calling us dopey.” 

Amaz-0 ignored me. He continued, “My tricks were the most amazing 
anyone had ever seen. And Frank was jealous. He was a sorcerer, working alone 
in a basement. He could cast amazing spells—but he was kind of ugly, with a 
high-pitched voice. People didn’t take him seriously. 

“He wanted to be famous like me, but he wasn’t. So he turned me into a 
rabbit. Very funny, right? Ha ha. Turn the magician into a rabbit. Yuk, yuk, yuk.” 

Foz and I exchanged baffled glances. Amaz-0 was turning out to be a little 
weird. 

“I’m not powerful enough to reverse Frank’s spell,” Amaz-0 went on. “I’m 
a magician, not a sorcerer. But I refused to let him stop me. So I built that 
mechanical dummy over there. I made him look just like me. And I kept on 
doing my shows, just as before.” 

“So you control the puppet?” Foz asked. “You make it look as if he’s the 
magician, performing all the tricks?” 

“I just said that, didn’t I?” Amaz-0 snapped. “Are you hard-of-hearing, 
kid?” 

“You’re really mde, you know that, Amaz-O?” I said. I was getting sick of 
his put-downs. “You’re the rudest person—or rabbit, or whatever—I ever met in 
my life!” 

Amaz-O’s long ears drooped. “Hey—I’m sorry,” he said. “Being a rabbit 
gets on my nerves. But also, I can’t let people get too close—you know? I don’t 
want anyone to find out my secret. It could ruin me.” 



Ginny squirmed in my arms again. I’d nearly forgotten all about her. I 
realized I’d better hurry up and ask Amaz-0 to help me change her back. 

“We’re in terrible trouble, Amaz-O,” I said, holding Ginny toward him. 
“This is my sister, Ginny. She ate some of the carrot that was in your magic kit 

55 

“So you confess, do you? You stole my magic kit!” 

“I—I only borrowed it,” I stammered. “I brought it back—see? I’m sorry.” 
“I’ll bet you are,” Amaz-0 snapped. 

“Can you help us, Amaz-O?” I pleaded. “Please, can you help me turn 
Ginny back into a girl?” 

Amaz-0 studied Ginny with his beady rabbit eyes. I held my breath waiting 
for his answer. 

He settled deeper into the couch and shook his head. “Sorry,” he said. 
“There’s nothing I can do for her.” 



29 


“Noooo!” I moaned, sinking into a chair. “You were my last chance. I’m 
doomed!” 

“You didn’t let me finish,” Amaz-0 said. “There’s nothing I can do for her 
—because the magic will wear off by itself.” 

“Yo! All right!” Foz exclaimed happily. He shot both fists into the air. 

“But when?” I asked. “My parents are coming home soon.” 

“How many bites of the carrot did she eat?” Amaz-0 asked. 

“Two,” I replied. 

“How long ago?” 

“About an hour ago,” I answered. 

“Okay,” Amaz-0 said. “She should turn back into a girl in half an hour. Do 
you feel better now?” 

I nodded and sighed with relief. That was a close one, I thought. But 
everything is going to be okay. 

“Hey—” Foz said, jumping up. “We’d better hurry up and take Ginny home 
—before she turns back into a girl. We don’t have enough bikes to go around!” 

I pushed Ginny into his arms. “Take her home, Foz,” I said. “I’ll be there in 
a few minutes.” I wanted to talk to Amaz-0 a little longer. 

Clutching Ginny in his arms, Foz hurried out of the dressing room. “Don’t 
stay too long,” he called over his shoulder. “I don’t want to be alone with Ginny 
when she turns back into a girl. I have a feeling she’s going to be in the mood to 
karate-chop somebody!” 

In reply, Ginny beat her hind legs against his chest. 

“I’m right behind you,” I promised. Foz disappeared down the dark 
hallway. 

“Listen, Amaz-O,” I said. “I’m really sorry I stole your magic bag. I know 
it was a terrible thing to do.” 

“Shove this stupid dummy aside and sit down on the couch,” Amaz-0 said. 
I moved the dummy and sat down next to Amaz-O. 

“You really love magic, don’t you?” he said. 

My heart started pounding. This was the heart-to-heart magician talk I’d 
been hoping to have with Amaz-0 all along! 



“It’s my dream to be a magician,” I told him. “A great magician like you. 
I’d do anything. Anything!” 

“Well, you were great in the show the other night,” Amaz-0 said. “You 
disappeared very well, kid.” 

“Thanks.” 

Amaz-0 sat quietly for a moment. He seemed to be thinking. 

“Say, kid—” he said at last. “How would you like to join the act? I’m 
getting really tired of working with that big wooden dummy over there.” 

“Me?” Now my heart was really racing. “You want me to join the act?” I 
got so excited I jumped off the couch. Then I quickly sat down again. “Do you 
mean it, Amaz-O? Do you think I could?” 

Amaz-0 hopped over to the dressing room door. He kicked it shut. 

“Why don’t we give you a try....” 



30 


And that’s how I joined Amaz-O’s act. I was so excited about being a magician, 
I said yes without even thinking about it. I guess I should’ve asked a few 
questions first. 

Don’t get me wrong. I love being on stage in front of clapping, cheering 
audiences. 

But I don’t like hiding inside the black top hat. And I hate it when the 
Amaz-0 dummy pulls me up too hard by the ears. That really hurts. 

I also hate it when they forget to clean my cage. Sometimes they forget 
about it for days! 

I guess I made a little mistake. See, when Amaz-0 said he was tired of 
working with the big dummy, I thought he wanted me to take the dummy’s 
place. 

I didn’t realize he wanted to retire—and have me take his place! 

I’m not complaining. Amaz-0 gives me plenty of juicy lettuce and all the 
carrots I can eat. I even have a stage name of my own now. At last. It may not be 
my first choice, but it’s still a professional name—“Fluffy.” 

The best part is, I’m on stage every night in a real magic act! My dream— 
my all-time dream! 

How many kids—er—I mean, rabbits—can say their all-time dream came 
true at age twelve? 

I’m really lucky—don’t you agree?

EGG MONSTERS 
FROM MARS 


Goosebumps - 42 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


My sister, Brandy, asked for an egg hunt for her tenth birthday party. And 
Brandy always gets what she wants. 

She flashes her smile, the one that makes the dimples pop up in her cheeks. 
And she puts on her little baby face. Opens her green eyes wide and tugs at her 
curly red hair. “Please? Please? Can I have an egg hunt at my party?” 

No way Mom and Dad can ever say no to her. 

If Brandy asked for a red, white, and blue ostrich for her birthday, Dad 
would be out in the garage right now, painting an ostrich. 

Brandy is good at getting her way. Real good. I’m her older brother, Dana 
Johnson. And I admit it. Even I have trouble saying no to Brandy. 

I’m not little and cute like my sister. I have straight black hair that falls over 
my forehead. And I wear glasses. And I’m a little chubby. “Dana, don’t look so 
serious.” That’s what Mom is always telling me. 

“Dana has an old soul,” Grandma Evelyn always says. 

I don’t really know what that means. I guess she means I’m more serious 
than most twelve-year-olds. 

Maybe that’s true. I’m not really serious all the time. I’m just curious about 
a lot of things. I’m very interested in science. I like studying bugs and plants and 
animals. I have an ant farm in my room. And two tarantulas. 

And I have my own microscope. Last night I studied a toenail under the 
microscope. It was a lot more interesting than you might think. 

I want to be a research scientist when I’m older. I’ll have my own lab, and 
I’ll study anything I want to. 

Dad is a kind of chemist. He works for a perfume company. He mixes 
things together to make new smells. He calls them fragrances. 

Before Mom met Dad, she worked in a lab. She did things with white rats. 

So both of my parents are happy that I’m into science. They encourage me. 
But that doesn’t mean they give me whatever I ask for. 

If I asked Dad for a red, white, and blue ostrich for my birthday, do you 
know what he’d say? He’d say, “Go play with your sister’s!” 

Anyway, Brandy asked for an egg hunt for her birthday. Her birthday is a 
week before Easter, so it wasn’t a crazy idea. 



We have a very large backyard. It stretches all the way back to a small, 
trickling creek. 

The yard is filled with bushes and trees and flower beds. And there’s a big 
old doghouse, even though we don’t have a dog. 

Lots of good egg-hiding places. 

So Brandy got her egg hunt. She invited her entire class. 

You may not think that egg hunts are exciting. 

But Brandy’s was. 

Brandy’s birthday came on a warm and sunny day. Only a few small cumulus 
clouds high in the sky. (I study clouds.) 

Mom hurried out to the backyard after breakfast, lugging a big bucket of 
eggs. “I’ll help you hide them,” I told her. 

“That wouldn’t be fair, Dana,” Mom replied. “You’re going to be in the egg 
hunt too—remember?” 

I almost forgot. Brandy usually doesn’t want me hanging around when her 
friends come over. But today she said that I could be in the egg hunt. And so 
could my best friend, Anne Gravel. 

Anne lives in the house next door. My mom is best friends with Anne’s 
mom. Mrs. Gravel agreed to let Mom hide eggs all over their backyard too. So 
it’s only fair that Anne gets to join in. 

Anne is tall and skinny, and has long red-brown hair. She’s nearly a head 
taller than me. So everyone thinks she’s older. But she’s twelve too. 

Anne is very funny. She’s always cracking jokes. She makes fun of me 
because I’m so serious. But I don’t mind. I know she’s only joking. 

That afternoon Anne and I stood on the driveway and watched the kids 
from Brandy’s class arrive at the party. Brandy handed each one of them a little 
straw basket. 

They were really excited when Brandy told them about the egg hunt. And 
the girls got even more excited when Brandy told them the grand prize—one of 
those expensive American Girl dolls. 

Of course the boys started to grumble. Brandy should have had a prize a 
boy might like. Some of the boys started using their baskets as Frisbees. And 
others began wrestling in the grass. 

“I was a lot more sophisticated when I was ten,” I muttered to Anne. 

“When you were ten, you liked Ninja Turtles,” Anne replied, rolling her 



eyes. 

“I did not!” I protested. 

“Yes, you did,” Anne insisted. “You wore a Ninja Turtle T-shirt to school 
every day.” 

I kicked some gravel across the driveway. “Just because I wore the shirt 
doesn’t mean I liked them,” I replied. 

Anne flung back her long hair. She sneered at me. I hate it when Anne 
sneers at me. “You had Ninja Turtle cups and plates at your tenth birthday party, 
Dana. And a Ninja Turtle tablecloth. And we played some kind of Ninja Turtle 
Pizza Pie-throwing game.” 

“But that doesn’t mean I liked them!” I declared. 

Three more girls from Brandy’s class came running across the lawn. I 
recognized them. They were the girls I call the Hair Sisters. They’re not sisters. 
But they spend all their time in Brandy’s room after school doing each other’s 
hair. 

Dad moved slowly across the grass toward them. He had his camcorder up 
to his face. The three Hair Sisters waved to the camera and yelled, “Happy 
Birthday, Brandy!” 

Dad tapes all our birthdays and vacations and big events. He keeps the tapes 
on a shelf in the den. We never watch them. 

The sun beamed down. The grass smelled sweet and fresh. The spring 
leaves on the trees were just starting to unfurl. 

“Okay—everyone follow me to the back!” Brandy ordered. 

The kids lined up in twos and threes, carrying their baskets. Anne and I 
followed behind them. Dad walked backwards, busily taping everything. 

Brandy led the way to the backyard. Mom was waiting there. “The eggs are 
hidden everywhere,” Mom announced, sweeping her hand in the air. 
“Everywhere you can imagine.” 

“Okay, everyone!” Brandy cried. “At the count of three, the egg hunt 
begins! One —” 

Anne leaned down and whispered in my ear. “Bet you five dollars I collect 
more eggs than you.” 

I smiled. Anne always knows how to make things more interesting. 

“Two—” 

“You’ve got a bet!” I told her. 

“Three!” Brandy called. 



The kids all cheered. The hunt for hidden eggs was on. 

They all began hurrying through the backyard, bending down to pick up 
eggs. Some of them moved on hands and knees through the grass. Some worked 
in groups. Some searched through the yard on their own. 

I turned and saw Anne stooping down, moving quickly along the side of the 
garage. She already had three eggs in her basket. 

I can’t let her win! I told myself. I sprang into action. 

I ran past a cluster of girls around the old doghouse. And I kept moving. 

I wanted to find an area of my own. A place where I could grab up a bunch 
of eggs without having to compete with the others. 

I jogged across the tall grass, making my way to the back. I was all alone, 
nearly to the creek, when I started my search. 

I spotted an egg hidden behind a small rock. I had to move fast. I wanted to 
win the bet. 

I bent down, picked it up, and quickly dropped it into my basket. 

Then I knelt down, set my basket on the ground, and started to search for 
more eggs. 

But I jumped up when I heard a scream. 



2 


“Aaaaaiiiiii!” 

The scream rang through the air. 

I turned back toward the house. One of the Hair Sisters was waving her 
hand wildly, calling to the other girls. I grabbed up my basket and ran toward 
her. 

“They’re not hard-boiled!” I heard her cry as I came closer. And I saw the 
drippy yellow yolk running down the front of her white T-shirt. 

“Mom didn’t have time to hard-boil them,” Brandy announced. “Or to paint 
them. I know it’s weird. But there just wasn’t time.” 

I raised my eyes to the house. Mom and Dad had both disappeared inside. 

“Be careful,” Brandy warned her party guests. “If you crack them—” 

She didn’t finish her sentence. I heard a wet splat. 

Then laughter. 

A boy had tossed an egg against the side of the doghouse. 

“Cool!” one of the girls exclaimed. 

Anne’s big sheepdog, Stubby, came running out of the doghouse. I don’t 
know why he likes to sleep in there. He’s almost as big as the house. 

But I didn’t have time to think about Stubby. 

Splat. 

Another egg exploded, this time against the garage wall. 

More laughter. Brandy’s friends thought it was really hilarious. 

“Egg fight! Egg fight!” two boys started to chant. 

I ducked as an egg went sailing over my head. It landed with a craaack on 
the driveway. 

Eggs were flying everywhere now. I stood there and gaped in amazement. 

I heard a shrill shriek. I spun around to see that two of the Hair Sisters had 
mnny yellow egg oozing in their hair. They were shouting and tugging at their 
hair and trying to pull the yellow gunk off with both hands. 

Splat! Another egg hit the garage. 

Craaack! Eggs bounced over the driveway. 

I ducked down and searched for Anne. She probably went home, I figured. 




Anne enjoys a good laugh. But she’s twelve, much too sophisticated for a 
babyish egg fight. 

Well, when I’m wrong, I’m wrong. 

“Think fast, Dana!” Anne screamed from behind me. I threw myself to the 
ground just in time. She heaved two eggs at once. They both whirred over my 
head and dropped onto the grass with a sickening crack. 

“Stop it! Stop it!” I heard Brandy shrieking desperately. “It’s my birthday! 
Stop it! It’s my birthday!” 

Thunk! Somebody hit Brandy in the chest with an egg. 

Wild laughter rang out. Sticky yellow puddles covered the back lawn. 

I raised my eyes to Anne. She was grinning back at me, about to let me 
have it again. 

Time for action. I reached into my basket and pulled out the one and only 
egg I had picked up. 

I raised it high above my head. Started to throw—but stopped. 

The egg. 

I lowered it and stared at it. 

Stared hard at it. 

Something was wrong with the egg. 

Something was terribly wrong. 



3 


The egg was too big. Bigger than a normal egg. About the size of a softball. 

I held it carefully, studying it. The color wasn’t right either. It wasn’t egg- 
colored. That creamy off-white. And it wasn’t brown. 

The egg was pale green. I raised it to the sunlight to make sure I was seeing 
correctly. 

Yes. Green. 

And what were those thick cracks up and down the shell? 

I ran my pointer finger over the dark, jagged lines. 

No. Not cracks. Some kind of veins. Blue-and-purple veins crisscrossing 
the green eggshell. 

“Weird!” I muttered out loud. 

Brandy’s friends were shouting and shrieking. Eggs were flying all around 
me. An egg splattered over my sneakers. The yellow yolk oozed over my laces. 

But I didn’t care. 

I rolled the strange egg over and over slowly between my hands. I brought 
it close to my face and squinted hard at the blue-and-purple veins. 

“Ooh.” I let out a low cry when I felt it pulsing. 

The veins throbbed. I could feel a steady beat. 

Thud. Thud. Thud. 

“Oh wow. It’s alivel” I cried. 

What had I found? It was totally weird. I couldn’t wait to get it to my 
worktable and examine it. 

But first I had to show it to Anne. 

“Anne! Hey—Anne!” I called and started jogging toward her, holding the 
egg high in both hands. 

I was staring at the egg. So I didn’t see Stubby, her big sheepdog, run in 
front of me. 

“Whooooa!” 

I let out a cry as I fell over the dog. 

And landed with a sickening crunch on top of my egg. 



4 


I jumped up quickly. Stubby started to lick my face. That dog has the worst 
breath! 

I shoved him away and bent down to examine my egg. 

“Hey!” I cried out in amazement. The egg wasn’t broken. I picked it up 
carefully and rolled it in my hands. 

Not a crack. 

What a tough shell! I thought. My chest had landed on top of the egg. 
Pushed it into the ground. But the shell hadn’t broken. 

I wrapped my hands around the big egg as if soothing it. 

I could feel the blue-and-purple veins pulsing. 

Is something inside getting ready to hatch? I wondered. What kind of bird 
was inside it? Not a chicken, I knew. This was definitely not a hen’s egg. Splat! 
Another egg smacked the side of the garage. 

Kids were wrestling in the runny puddles of yolk on the grass. I turned in 
time to see a boy crack an egg over another boy’s head. 

“Stop it! Stop it!” 

Brandy was screaming at the top of her lungs, trying to stop the egg fight 
before every single egg was smashed. I turned and saw Mom and Dad running 
across the yard. 

“Hey, Anne—!” I called. I climbed to my feet, holding the weird egg 
carefully. Anne was frantically tossing eggs at three girls. The girls were 
bombarding her. Three to one—but Anne wasn’t retreating. 

“Anne—check this out!” I called, hurrying over to her. “You won’t believe 
this egg!” 

I stepped up beside her and held the egg out to her. 

“No! Wait—!” I cried. 

Too late. 

Anne grabbed my egg and heaved it at the three girls. 



5 


“No—stop!” I wailed. 

As I stared in horror, one of the three girls caught the egg in midair—and 
tossed it back. 

I dove for it, making a headfirst slide. And grabbed the egg in one hand 
before it hit the gravel. 

Was it broken? 

No. 

This shell must be made of steel! I told myself. I pulled myself to my feet, 
gripping the egg carefully. To my surprise, it felt hot. Burning hot. 

“Whoa!” I nearly dropped it. 

Throb. Throb. Throb. 

It pulsed rapidly. I could feel the veins beating against my fingers. 

I wanted to show the egg to Mom and Dad. But they were busy breaking up 
the egg fight. 

Dad’s face was bright red. He was shouting at Brandy and pointing to the 
yellow stains up and down the side of the garage. 

Mom was trying to calm down two girls who were crying. They had egg 
yolk stuck to their hair and all over their clothes. They even had it stuck to their 
eyebrows. I guess that’s why they were crying. 

Behind them Stubby was having a feast. He was running around in circles, 
lapping up egg after egg from the grass, his bushy tail wagging like crazy. 

What a party! 

I decided to take my weird egg inside. I wanted to study it later. Maybe I’d 
break off a tiny piece of shell and look at it under the microscope. Then I’d make 
a tiny hole in the shell and try to see inside. 

Throb. Throb. 

The veins pounded against my hand. The egg still felt hot. 

It might be a turtle egg, I decided. I walked carefully to the house, cradling 
it in both hands. 

One morning last fall, Anne found a big box turtle on the curb in front of 
her house. She carried it into her backyard and called me over. She knew I’d 
want to study it. 



It was a pretty big turtle. About the size of a lunch box. Anne and I 
wondered how it got to her curb. 

Up in my room I had a book about turtles. I knew the book would help me 
identify it. I had hurried home to get the book. But Mom wouldn’t let me go 
back out. I had to stay inside and have lunch. 

When I got back to Anne’s backyard, the turtle had vanished. I guess it 
wandered away. 

Turtles can be pretty fast when they want to be. 

As I carried my treasure into the house, I thought it might be a turtle egg. 
But why was it so hot? And why did it have those yucky veins all over it? 

Eggs don’t have veins—do they? 

I hid the egg in my dresser drawer. I surrounded it with my balled-up socks 
to protect it. Then I closed the drawer slowly, carefully, and returned to the 
backyard. 

Brandy’s guests were all leaving as I stepped outside. They were covered in 
sticky eggs. They didn’t look too happy. 

Brandy didn’t look too happy, either. Dad was busy shouting at her, angrily 
waving his arms, pointing to the gloppy egg stains all over the lawn. 

“Why did you let this happen?” he screamed at her. “Why didn’t you stop 

it?” 

“I tried!” Brandy wailed. “I tried to stop it!” 

“We’ll have to have the garage painted,” Mom murmured, shaking her 
head. “How will we ever mow the lawn?” 

“This was the worst party I ever had!” Brandy cried. She bent down and 
pulled chunks of eggshell from her sneaker laces. Then she glared up at Mom. 
“It’s all your fault!” 

“Huh?” Mom gasped. “My fault?” 

“You didn’t hard-boil the eggs,” Brandy accused. “So it’s all your fault.” 
Mom started to protest—but bit her lip instead. 

Brandy stood up and tossed the bits of eggshell to the ground. She flashed 
Mom her best dimpled smile. “Next year for my birthday, can we have a Make 
Your Own Ice-Cream Sundae party?” 

That evening I wanted to study my weird green egg. But we had to go visit 
Grandma Evelyn and Grandpa Harry and take them out to dinner. They always 
make a big fuss about Brandy’s birthday. 



First, Brandy had to open her presents. Grandma Evelyn bought her a pair 
of pink fuzzy slippers that Brandy will never wear. She’ll probably give them to 
Stubby as chew toys. 

Brandy opened the biggest box next. She pulled out a pair of pink-and- 
white pajamas. Brandy made a big fuss about them and said she really needed 
pajamas. She did a pretty good acting job. 

But how excited can you get over pajamas? 

Her last present was a twenty-five-dollar gift certificate to the CD store at 
the mall. Nice present. “I’ll go with you to make sure you don’t pick out 
anything lame,” I offered. 

Brandy pretended she didn’t hear me. 

She gave our grandparents big hugs. Brandy is a big hugger. Then we all 
went out for dinner at the new Italian restaurant on the corner. 

What did we talk about at dinner? Brandy’s wild birthday party. When we 
told Grandma and Grandpa about the egg fight, they laughed and laughed. 

It wasn’t so funny in the afternoon. But a few hours later at dinner, we all 
had to admit it was pretty funny. Even Dad managed a smile or two. 

I kept thinking about the egg in my dresser drawer. When we got back 
home, would I find a baby turtle on my socks? 

Dinner stretched on and on. Grandpa Harry told all of his funny golfing 
stories. He tells them every time we visit. We always laugh anyway. 

We didn’t return home till really late. Brandy fell asleep in the car. And I 
could barely keep my eyes open. 

I slunk up to my room and changed into pajamas. Then, with a loud yawn, I 
turned off the light. I knew I’d fall asleep the moment my head hit the pillow. 

I fluffed my pillow the way I liked it. Then I slid into bed and pulled the 
quilt up to my chin. 

I started to settle my head on the pillow when I heard the sound. 

Thump. Thump. Thump. 

Steady like a heartbeat. Only louder. 

Much louder. 

THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 

So loud, I could hear the dresser drawers rattling. 

I sat straight up. Wide awake now. I stared through the darkness to my 
dresser. 

THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 



I turned and lowered my feet to the floor. 

Should I open the dresser drawer? 

I sat in the darkness, trembling with excitement. With fear. 
Listening to the steady thud. 

Should I open the drawer and check it out? 

Or should I run as far away as I could? 



6 


Thump, thump, THUMP. 

I had to see what was happening in my dresser drawer. 

Had the egg hatched? Was the turtle bumping up against the sides of the 
drawer, trying to climb out? 

Was it a turtle? 

Or was it something weird? 

Suddenly I felt very afraid of it. 

I took a deep breath and rose to my feet. My legs felt rubbery and weak as I 
made my way across the room. My mouth was suddenly as dry as cotton. 

Thump, THUMP, thump. 

I clicked on the light. Blinked several times, struggling to force my eyes to 
focus. 

The steady thuds grew louder as I approached the dresser. 

Heartbeats, I told myself. 

Heartbeats of the creature inside the egg. 

I grabbed the drawer handles with both hands. Took another deep breath. 

Dana, this is your last chance to run away, I warned myself. 

This is your last chance to leave the drawer safely closed. 

Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump. 

I tugged open the drawer and peered inside. 

I stared in, amazed that nothing had changed. The egg sat exactly where I 
had left it. The blue-and-purple veins along the shell pulsed as before. 

Feeling a little calmer, I picked it up. 

“Ouch!” 

I nearly dropped it. The shell was burning hot. 

I cupped it in my hands and blew on it. “This is so totally weird,” I 
murmured to myself. 

Mom and Dad have to see it, I decided. Right now. Maybe they can tell me 
what it is. 

They were still awake. I could hear them talking in their room down the 


hall. 



I carried the egg carefully, cradling it in both hands. I had to knock on their 
door with my elbow. “It’s me,” I said. 

“Dana, what is it?” Dad demanded grumpily. “It’s been a long day. We’re 
all very tired.” 

I pushed open their door a crack. “I have an egg I want to show you,” I 
started. 

“No eggs!” they both cried at once. 

“Haven’t we seen enough eggs for one day?” Mom griped. 

“It’s a very strange egg,” I insisted. “I can’t identify it. I think—” 

“Good night, Dana,” Dad interrupted. 

“Please don’t ever mention eggs again,” Mom added. “Promise?” 

“Well, I...” I stared down at the pulsing green egg in my hand. “It’ll only 
take a second. If you’ll just—” 

“Dana!” Dad yelled. “Why don’t you go sit on it and hatch it?” 

“Clark—don’t talk to Dana that way!” Mom scolded. 

“He’s twelve years old. He can take a joke,” Dad protested. 

They started arguing about how Dad should talk to me. 

I muttered good night and started back to my room. 

I mean, I can take a hint. 

Thump. Thump. The egg pulsed in my hand. 

I had a sudden impulse to crack it open and see what was inside. But of 
course I would never do that. 

I stopped outside Brandy’s room. I was desperate to show my weird 
treasure to somebody. I knocked on her door. 

No answer. 

I knocked again, a little harder. Brandy is a very heavy sleeper. 

Still no answer. 

I started to knock a third time—and the door flew open. Brandy greeted me 
with an open-mouthed yawn. “What’s wrong? Why’d you wake me?” 

“I want to show you this egg,” I told her. 

She narrowed her eyes at me. “You’re serious? After what happened at my 
party? After the worst birthday party in the history of America, you really want 
to show me an egg?” 

I held it up. “Yeah. Here it is.” 

She slammed the door in my face. 

“You mean you don’t want to see it?” I called in. 



No reply. 

Once again, I could take a hint. I carried the egg back to my room and set it 
down carefully in the dresser drawer. Then I closed the drawer and climbed back 
into bed. 

Thump. Thump. Thump. 

I fell asleep to the steady throbbing. 

The next morning, I woke up just in time to watch the egg hatch. 



7 


A loud cracking sound woke me up. 

Blinking, I pulled myself up on one elbow. Still half-asleep, I thought I 
heard Brandy cracking her knuckles. 

That’s one of Brandy’s secret talents. She never does it when adults are 
around. But when we’re alone, she can crack out entire symphonies on her 
knuckles. 

Another loud crack snapped me alert. 

The dresser. The noises were coming from my dresser. 

I heard a long rip, like Velcro ripping open. Then more cracks. Like 
cracking bones. 

And I knew it had to be the egg. 

My heart started to pound. I leaped up. Grabbed my glasses and slapped 
them onto my face. My legs got tangled in the bedsheet, and I nearly went 
sprawling over the floor. 

I hurtled across the room. The egg was hatching—and I had to be there in 
time to watch. 

I grabbed the drawer handles and eagerly pulled the drawer open. I was so 
eager, I nearly pulled the drawer out of the dresser! 

Catching my balance, I gripped the dresser top with both hands and stared 
down at the egg. 

Craaaaack. 

The blue-and-purple veins throbbed. A long, jagged crack split across the 
green shell. 

Unh unh. 

I heard a low grunt from inside the egg. The grunt of a creature working 
hard to push out. 

Unnnnnh. 

What a struggle! 

It doesn’t sound like a turtle, I told myself. Is it some kind of exotic bird? 
Like a parrot? Or a flamingo maybe? 

How would a flamingo egg get in my backyard? 

How would any weird egg get in my backyard? 



Unnnh unnnnh. 

Craaaaack. 

The sounds were really gross. 

I rubbed my eyes and squinted down at the egg. It was bouncing and 
bobbing in the drawer now. Each grunt made the egg move. 

The veins throbbed. Another crack split along the front of the shell. And 
thick yellow goo poured out into the drawer, seeping onto my socks. 

“Yuck!” I cried. 

The egg shook. Another crack. More of the thick liquid oozed down the egg 
and onto my socks. 

The egg bobbed and bounced. I heard more hard grunting. Unnnnh. 
Unnnnh. The egg trembled with each grunt. 

Yellow slime oozed as the cracks in the shell grew wider. The veins pulsed. 
The egg shook. 

And then a large triangle of shell broke off. It fell into the drawer. 

I leaned closer to stare into the hole in the egg. I couldn’t really see what 
was inside. I could see only wet yellow blobby stuff. 

Unnh unnnnnh. 

Another grunt—and the eggshell crackled and fell apart. Yellow liquid 
spilled into the drawer, soaking my socks. 

I held my breath as a weird creature pushed itself out of the breaking shell. 
A yellow, lumpy thing. 

A baby chicken? 

No way. 

I couldn’t see a head. Or wings. Or feet. 

I gripped the dresser top and stared down at it. The strange animal pushed 
away the last section of shell. This was amazing! 

It rolled wetly over my socks. 

A blob. A sticky, shiny yellow blob. 

It looked like a pile of very runny scrambled eggs. 

Except it had tiny green veins crisscrossing all over it. 

My chest felt about to explode. I finally remembered to breathe. I let out my 
breath in a long whoosh. My heart was thudding. 

The yellow blob throbbed. It made sick, wet sucking sounds. 

It turned slowly. And I saw round black eyes near its top. 

No head. No face. Just two tiny black eyes on top of the lumpy yellow 



body. 

“You’re not a chicken,” I murmured out loud. My voice came out in a 
choked whisper. “You’re definitely not a chicken.” 

But what was it? 

“Hey—Mom! Dad!” I shouted. 

They had to see this creature. They had to see the scientific discovery of the 
century! 

“Mom! Dad! Hurry!” 

No response. 

The lumpy creature stared up at me. Throbbing. Its tiny green veins pulsing. 
Its eggy body bouncing. 

“Mom? Dad?” 

Silence. 

I stared into my drawer. 

What should I do? 



8 


I had to show it to Mom and Dad. I carefully closed the dresser drawer so it 
couldn’t bounce out and escape. Then I went running downstairs, shouting at the 
top of my voice. 

My pajama pants were twisted, and I nearly fell down the stairs. “Mom! 
Dad! Where are you?” 

The house was silent. The vacuum cleaner had been pulled out of the closet. 
But no one was around to use it. 

I burst into the kitchen. Were they still having breakfast? 

“Mom? Dad? Brandy?” 

No one there. 

Sunlight streamed in through the kitchen window. The breakfast dishes— 
three cereal bowls and two coffee cups—were stacked beside the sink. 

Where did they go? I wondered, my heart pounding. How could they leave 
when I had the most amazing thing in the history of the known universe to show 
them? 

I turned to leave the kitchen when I saw the note on the refrigerator. It was 
written in blue ink in Mom’s handwriting. I snatched it off the magnet and read 
it: 

“Dad and I took Brandy to her piano lesson. Make yourself some cereal. 
Love, M.” 

Cereal? 

Cereal ? 

How could I think about cereal at a time like this? 

What should I do now? 

I leaned my forehead against the cool refrigerator, struggling to think. I 
couldn’t leave the throbbing egg blob locked up in the dresser drawer all 
morning. Maybe it needed fresh air. Maybe it needed exercise. Maybe it needed 
food. 

Food? I swallowed hard. What would it eat? What could it eat? It was just a 
lump of scrambled eggs with eyes. 

I’ve got to take it out of there, I decided. I’ve got to show it to someone. 

I thought instantly of Anne. 



“Yes!” I exclaimed to myself. I’ll take it next door and show it to Anne. She 
has a dog. She’s really good with pets and animals. Maybe she’ll have some idea 
of what I should do with it. 

I hurried back upstairs and pulled on the jeans and T-shirt I had tossed on 
the floor the night before. Then I made my way to the dresser and slid open the 
drawer. 

“Yuck!” 

The egg blob sat in its own yellow slime. Its whole body throbbed. The 
tiny, round eyes stared up at me. 

“I’m taking you to Anne’s,” I told it. “Maybe the two of us can figure out 
what you are.” 

Only one problem. 

How do I take it there? 

I rubbed my chin, staring down at it. Do I carry it on a plate? No. It might 
tumble off. 

A bowl? 

No. Ajar? 

No. It couldn’t breathe. 

A box. 

Yes. I’ll put it in a box, I decided. I opened my closet, dropped to my hands 
and knees, and shuffled through all the junk piled on the floor. 

That’s how I clean my room. I toss everything into the closet and shut the 
door. I have the cleanest room in the house. No problem. 

The only problem is finding things in my closet. If I’m searching for 
something to wear, sometimes it takes a few days. 

Today I got lucky. I found what I was looking for right away. It was a shoe 
box. The box my new sneakers came in. 

I picked up the shoe box from the clutter and climbed to my feet. Then I 
kicked a bunch of stuff back into the closet so I could get the door closed. 

“Okay!” I cried happily. I returned to the throbbing egg glob. “I’m carrying 
you to Anne’s in this box. Ready?” 

I didn’t expect it to answer. And it didn’t. 

I pulled off the shoe box lid and set it on the dresser top. Then I lowered the 
box to the drawer. 

“Now what?” I asked myself out loud. 

How do I get it in the box? Do I just pick it up? 



Pick it up in my hand? 

I held the box in my left hand and started to reach into the drawer with my 
right. But then I jerked my hand away. 

Will it bite me? I wondered. 

How can it? It doesn’t have a mouth. 

Will it sting me? Will it hurt me somehow? 

My throat tightened. My hand started to tremble. It was so gross—so wet 
and eggy. 

Pick it up, Dana, I told myself. Stop being such a wimp. You’re a scientist 
—remember? You have to be bold. You have to be daring. 

That’s true, I knew. Scientists can’t back away from something just because 
it’s yucky and gross. 

I took a deep breath. 

I counted to three. 

Then I reached for it. 



9 


As my hand moved toward it, the creature began to tremble. It shook like a glob 
of yellow Jell-O. 

I pulled back once again. 

I can’t do it, I decided. I can’t pick it up barehanded. It might be too 
dangerous. 

I watched it shake and throb. Wet bubbles formed on its eggy skin. 

Is it scared of me? I wondered. Or is it trying to warn me away? 

I had to find something to pick it up. I turned and glanced around the room. 
My eyes landed on my baseball glove tucked on the top shelf of my bookcase. 

Maybe I could pick up the egg creature in the glove and drop it into the 
shoe box. I was halfway across the room when I decided I didn’t want to get my 
glove all wet and gloppy. 

I need to shovel it into the box, I thought. 

A little shovel would make the job easy. I walked back to the dresser. The 
egg creature was still shaking like crazy. I closed the drawer. Maybe the darkness 
will calm it down, I thought. 

I made my way down to the basement. Mom and Dad keep all their 
gardening supplies down there. I found a small metal trowel and carried it back 
up to my room. 

When I pulled open the drawer, the eggy blob was still shaking. “Don’t 
worry, fella,” I told it. “I’m a scientist. I’ll be real gentle.” 

I don’t think it understood English. As I lowered the trowel into the drawer, 
the green veins on the throbbing body began to pulse. 

The creature started bobbing up and down. The little black eyes bulged up 
at me. I had the feeling the little guy was about to explode or something. 

“Easy. Easy,” I whispered. 

I lowered the trowel carefully beside it. Then I slowly, slowly slid it under 
the throbbing creature. 

“There. Gotcha,” I said softly. 

It wiggled and shook on the blade of the trowel. I began to lift it carefully 
from the drawer. 

The shoe box sat on the top of the dresser. I had the trowel in my right 



hand. I reached for the shoe box with my left. 

Up, up. Slowly. Very slowly, I raised the egg creature toward the box. 
Up. Up. 

Almost to the box. 

And the creature growled at me! 

A low, gruff growl—like an angry dog. 

“Ohhh!” I uttered a startled cry—and the trowel dropped from my hand. 
“Yaaiii!” I let out another cry as it clanged across the floor—and the 
creature plopped wetly onto my sneaker. 

“No!” 

Without thinking, I bent down and grabbed it up in my hand. 

I’m holding it! I realized, my heart pounding. 

I’m holding it. 

What’s going to happen to me? 



10 


Nothing happened. 

No shock jolted my body. No rash spread instantly over my skin. My hand 
didn’t fall off. 

The creature felt warm and soft, like runny scrambled eggs. 

I realized I was squeezing it tightly. Too tightly? I loosened my grip. 

And lowered it into the shoe box. And fastened the lid over the top. 

I set the shoe box down on the dresser top and examined my hand. It felt 
wet and sticky. But the skin hadn’t turned yellow or peeled off or anything. 

I could hear the creature pulsing inside the box. 

“Don’t growl like that again,” I told it. “You scared me.” 

I grabbed some tissues and wiped off my hand. I kept my eyes on the box. 
The creature was bouncing around in there. 

What kind of animal is it? I wondered. 

I wished Mom and Dad were home. I really, really wanted to show it to 
them. 

I glanced at the clock radio on my bedside table. Only nine o’clock. Anne 
might still be sleeping. Sometimes she slept until noon on Saturdays. I’m not 
really sure why. She said it made the day go faster. Anne is a pretty weird girl. 

I lifted the box with both hands. The egg creature felt surprisingly heavy. I 
made sure the lid was on tight. Then I carried it down the stairs and out the back 
door. 

It was a sunny, warm day. A soft breeze made the fresh spring leaves 
tremble on the trees. Two houses down Mr. Simpson was already mowing his 
back lawn. Near the garage two robins were having a tug-of-war over a fat 
brown earthworm. 

I carried the box to Anne’s back door. The door was open. I peered through 
the screen. 

“Hi, Dana. Come in,” Anne’s mother called from in front of the sink. 

Balancing the box against my chest, I pulled open the screen door and 
stepped into the kitchen. Anne sat at the breakfast table. She wore a big blue T- 
shirt over black bike shorts. Her red-brown hair was tied behind her head in a 
long ponytail. 



Three guesses what she was eating for breakfast. 

You got it. Scrambled eggs. 

“Yo, Dana!” she greeted me. “What’s up?” 

“Well—” 

Mrs. Gravel moved to the stove. “Dana, have you had breakfast? Can I 
make you some scrambled eggs?” 

My stomach did a flip-flop. I swallowed hard. “No. I don’t think so.” 

“Nice fresh eggs,” Mrs. Gravel insisted. “I could make them fried if you 
don’t like scrambled.” 

“No thanks,” I replied weakly. 

I felt the eggy blob bounce inside the box. 

“I might need some more,” Anne told her mom, shoveling in a big glob. 
“These eggs are great, Mom.” 

Mrs. Gravel cracked an egg on the side of the skillet. “Maybe I’ll make one 
for myself,” she said. 

All this egg talk was making me sick. 

Anne finished her orange juice. “Hey—what’s in the box? New sneakers?” 

“Uh... no,” I replied. “Check this out, Anne. You won’t believe what I 
found.” 

I was so eager to show it to her! Holding the box in front of me with both 
hands, I started across the kitchen. 

And tripped over Stubby. 

Again! 

That big dumb sheepdog always got underfoot. 

“Whooooaaa!” I let out a cry as I fell over the dog—and watched the shoe 
box fly into the air. 

I landed on top of Stubby. Got a mouthful of fur. 

Struggled frantically to my feet. 

And saw the egg creature sail out of the box and drop onto Anne’s breakfast 
plate. 

Anne’s mouth dropped open. Her face twisted in disgust. “Oh, yuck!” she 
wailed. “Rotten eggs! Gross! Rotten eggs!” 

“No—it’s alive!” I protested. 

But I don’t think anyone heard me. Stubby jumped up on me as I started to 
explain, and nearly knocked me down again. 

“Down, boy! Down!” Mrs. Gravel scolded. “You know better than that.” 



“Get this away!” Anne demanded, shoving her plate across the table. 

Her mom examined the plate, then glared at me. “Dana, what’s wrong with 
you? This isn’t funny. You ruined perfectly good scrambled eggs.” 

“You spoiled my breakfast!” Anne cried angrily. 

“No, wait—” I protested. 

But I wasn’t fast enough. 

Mrs. Gravel grabbed up the plate. She carried it to the sink, clicked on the 
garbage disposal—and started to empty the egg creature into the roaring drain. 



11 


“Nooooo!” 

I let out a shriek—and dove for the sink. 

I made a wild grab and pulled the creature from the drain. 

No. I pulled a handful of scrambled eggs from the drain! 

The egg creature rolled around the sink and started to slide toward the 
gurgling drain. I tossed the scrambled eggs down and grabbed the creature as it 
started to drop toward the grinding blades. 

The lumpy yellow blob felt hot in my hands. I could feel the veins 
throbbing. The whole creature pulsed rapidly, like a racing heart. 

I raised it up to my face and examined it. Still in one piece. “I saved your 
life!” I told it. “Whew! What a close one!” 

I balanced it carefully in my palm. It shuddered and throbbed. Wet bubbles 
rolled down its lumpy sides. The black eyes stared up at me. 

“What is that thing?” Anne demanded, getting up from the breakfast table. 
She straightened her long ponytail. “Is it a puppet? Did you make it out of an old 
sock or something?” 

Before I could answer, Mrs. Gravel gave me a gentle push toward the 
kitchen door. “Get it out of here, Dana,” she ordered. “It’s disgusting.” She 
pointed down. “Look. It’s dripping some kind of eggy goo all over my kitchen 
floor.” 

“I—I found it out back,” I started. “I don’t really know what it is, but—” 

“Out,” Anne’s mom insisted. She held open the screen door for me. “Out. I 
mean it. I don’t want to have to wash the whole floor.” 

I didn’t have a choice. I carried the egg creature out into the backyard. It 
seemed a little calmer. At least it wasn’t trembling and pulsing so hard. 

Anne followed me to the driveway. The bright sun made the egg creature 
gleam. My hands felt slimy and wet. I didn’t want to squeeze it too tightly. But I 
also didn’t want to let it fall. 

“Is it a puppet?” Anne demanded. She bent down to see it better. “Yuck. It’s 
alive?” 

I nodded. “I don’t know what it is. But it’s definitely alive. I found it 
yesterday. At Brandy’s party.” 



Anne continued to study the yellow blob. “You found it? Where?” 

“I found an egg back by the creek,” I told her. “A very weird-looking egg. I 
took it home, and it hatched this morning. And this is what came out.” 

“But what is it?” Anne asked. She gingerly poked its side with a pointer 
finger. “Oh, yuck. It’s wet and mushy.” 

“It’s not a chicken,” I replied. 

“Duhhh,” Anne said, rolling her eyes. “Did you figure that out all by 
yourself?” 

“I thought it might be a turtle egg,” I said, ignoring her sarcasm. 

She squinted harder at it. “Do you think it’s a turtle without its shell? Do 
turtles hatch without their shells?” 

“I don’t think so,” I replied. 

“Maybe it’s some kind of mistake,” Anne suggested. “A freak of nature. 
You know. Like you!” She laughed. 

Anne has a great sense of humor. 

She poked the egg creature again. The creature let out a soft wheeze of air. 
“Maybe you discovered a new species,” Anne suggested. “A whole new kind of 
animal that’s never been seen before.” 

“Maybe,” I replied. That was an exciting idea. 

“They’ll name it after you,” Anne teased. “They’ll call it the Dodo!” She 
laughed again. 

“You’re not being very helpful,” I said sharply. 

And then I had an idea. 

“Know what I’m going to do with it?” I said, cupping it carefully between 
my hands. “I’m going to take it to that little science lab.” 

She narrowed her eyes at me. “What science lab?” 

“You know that little lab,” I replied impatiently. “The one on Denver Street. 
Just three blocks from here.” 

“I don’t hang out at weird little science labs,” Anne said. 

“Well, I don’t, either,” I told her. “But I’ve passed by that lab a million 
times, riding my bike to school. I’m going to take this thing there. Someone will 
tell me what it is.” 

“I’m not going with you,” Anne said, crossing her skinny arms in front of 
her chest. “I have better things to do.” 

“I didn’t invite you,” I sneered. 

She sneered back at me. 



I think she was jealous that I found the mysterious creature and she didn’t. 

“Please get me the shoe box,” I said. “I left it in your kitchen. I’m going to 
ride my bike over to that lab right now.” 

Anne went inside and came back with the shoe box. “It’s all sticky inside,” 
she said, making a disgusted face. “Whatever that thing is, it sure sweats a lot.” 

“Maybe your face scared it!” I declared. My turn to laugh. I’m usually the 
serious one. I don’t get off too many jokes. But that was a pretty good one. 

Anne ignored it. She watched as I lowered the creature into the box. Then 
she raised her eyes to me. “You sure that isn’t some kind of wind-up toy? This 
thing is all a big joke—isn’t it, Dana?” 

I shook my head. “No way. It’s no joke. I’ll stop by later and tell you what 
the scientists at the lab say about it.” 

I fit the lid on the shoe box. Then I hurried to the garage to get my bike. 

I couldn’t wait to get to the science lab. 

As it turned out, I should have stayed as far away from that place as 
possible. 

But how could I know what was waiting for me there? 



12 


“Look out!” 

Anne’s stupid sheepdog ran in front of my bike just as I started down the 
driveway. 

I jammed on the hand brake. My bike squealed to a sharp stop—and the 
shoe box nearly toppled off the handlebars. 

“Stubby—you moron!” I shrieked. 

The dog loped off across the backyard, probably laughing to himself. I 
think Stubby gets a real thrill by tripping me up whenever he sees me. 

I waited for my heart to stop thudding in my chest. Then I steadied the shoe 
box on the handlebars. 

I started pedaling along the street, steering with one hand, keeping the other 
hand on top of the box. 

“The scientists at the lab have got to know what this thing is,” I told myself. 
“They’ve got to.” 

I usually speed down my street. But this morning I pedaled slowly. I 
stopped at each corner to make sure no cars were coming. 

I tried to steer away from bumps in the street. But my street has a lot of 
potholes. Each time I hit a bump, I could hear the egg creature bouncing inside 
the carton. 

Just don’t bounce out, I thought. 

I pictured it bouncing out of the box, dropping onto the street, and being run 
over by a car. 

I stopped to balance it better on the handlebars. Then I began pedaling 
slowly again. 

Some kids from school were starting up a softball game on the playground 
on the next block. They called to me. I think they wanted me to join the game. 

But I pretended I didn’t hear them. I didn’t have time for softball. I was on a 
scientific mission. I didn’t look back. I kept pedaling. 

As I turned the corner onto Denver, a city bus roared past. The whoosh of 
air from the bus nearly knocked me over. 

As I steadied the bike, I saw the lid push up from the shoe box. 

The egg creature was trying to escape! 



I grabbed the box and tried to push down the lid. I pedaled faster. The lab 
was only a block away. 

The creature pushed up against the lid. 

I pushed back. 

I didn’t want to crush it. But I didn’t want it to escape, either. 

I could feel it bouncing inside the box. Pushing up against the lid. 

I kept my hand on the lid, struggling to hold it down. 

A station wagon filled with kids rumbled past. One of the kids yelled 
something to me. I didn’t really hear him. I was concentrating as hard as I could 
on keeping the egg creature inside the box. 

I rolled through a stop sign. I didn’t even see it. Luckily no cars were 
approaching. 

The lab came into view on the next corner. It was a white shingled building. 
Very low. Only one story tall. But very long. With a row of small, square 
windows along the front. It looked like a very long train car. 

I bumped up the curb and rode my bike onto the grass. Then I grabbed the 
shoe box with both hands and hopped off. The bike fell to the ground, both 
wheels spinning. 

Gripping the box tightly in both hands, I ran across the front lawn, up to the 
white double doors in front. 

I found a doorbell on the wall to the right of the doors. I pushed it. Pushed it 
again. Kept my finger on it. 

When no one came to the door, I tried the knob. Pushed. Then pulled. 

No. The door was locked. 

I tried knocking. I pounded as hard as I could with my fist. 

Then I rang the bell again. 

Where was everyone? 

I was about to start pounding again when I saw the sign over the door. A 
small, hand-printed black-and-white sign that sent my heart sinking. It read: 

CLOSED SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS. 



13 


I let out a long sigh and shoved the box under my arm. I was so disappointed. 
What was I going to do with this weird egg creature now? 

Shaking my head unhappily, I turned and started back to my bike. I was 
halfway across the grass when I heard the front door open. 

I turned to see an older man in a white lab coat. He had shiny white hair, 
parted in the middle and slicked down on the sides. His moustache was salt-and- 
pepper. He had pale blue eyes that peered out at me from his pale, wrinkly face. 

His smile made his eyes crinkle up at the sides. “Can I help you?” he asked. 

“Uh... yeah,” I stammered. I raised the shoe box in front of me and started 
back across the grass. I could feel the egg creature bouncing around in there. 

“Is that a sick bird?” the man asked, squinting at the box. “I’m afraid I can’t 
help you with that. This is a science lab. I’m not a vet.” 

“No. It’s not a bird,” I told him. I carried the box to the doorway. My heart 
was pounding. For some reason, I felt really nervous. 

I guess I was excited about talking to a real scientist. I respect and admire 
scientists so much. 

Also, I was excited about finally finding out what had hatched from that 
weird egg. And finding out what I should do with it. 

The man smiled at me again. He had a warm, friendly smile that made me 
feel a little calmer. “Well, if it isn’t a bird in there, what is it?” he asked softly. 

“I was hoping you could tell me!” I replied. I shoved the shoe box toward 
him, but he didn’t take it. 

“It’s something I found,” I continued. “I mean, I found an egg. In my 
backyard.” 

“An egg? What kind of egg, son?” 

“I don’t know,” I told him. “It was very big. And it had veins all over it. 
And it kind of breathed.” 

He stared at me. “An egg that breathed.” 

I nodded. “I put it in my dresser drawer. And then it hatched this morning. 
And—” 

“Come in, son,” the man said. “Come right in.” His expression changed. 
His eyes flashed. He suddenly looked very interested. 



He put a hand on my shoulder and guided me into the lab. I had to blink a 
few times and wait for my eyes to adjust to the dim light inside. 

The walls were all white. I saw a desk and chairs. A low table with some 
science magazines on it. This was a waiting room, I decided. It was all very 
clean and modern-looking. A lot of chrome and glass and white leather. 

The man had his eyes on the box in my hands. He rubbed his moustache 
with his fingers. “I’m Dr. Gray,” he announced. “I’m the managing lab scientist 
here.” 

I switched the box to my left hand so I could shake hands with him. “I want 
to be a scientist when I’m older,” I blurted out. I could feel my face turning red. 

“What’s your name, son?” Dr. Gray asked. 

“Oh. Uh. Dana Johnson. I live a few blocks away. On Melrose.” 

“It’s nice to meet you, Dana,” Dr. Gray said, straightening the front of his 
white lab coat. He moved to the front door. He closed it, locked it, and bolted it. 

That’s weird, I thought, feeling a shiver of fear. 

Why did he do that? 

Then I remembered that the lab was closed on weekends. He probably bolts 
the doors when the place is closed. 

“Follow me,” Dr. Gray said. He led the way down the narrow white 
hallway. I followed him into a small lab. I saw a long table cluttered with all 
kinds of test tubes, specimen jars, and electronic equipment. 

“Set the box down there,” he instructed, pointing to an empty spot on the 
table. 

I set the box down. He reached in front of me to remove the lid. “You found 
this in your backyard?” 

I nodded. “Back by the creek.” 

He carefully pulled the lid off the box. 

“Oh my goodness!” he murmured. 



14 


The egg creature stared up at us. It quivered and bubbled against the side of the 
box. The bottom of the box was puddled with a sticky yellow goo. 

“So you found one,” Dr. Gray murmured, tilting the box. The yellow blob 
slid to the other end. 

“Found one?” I replied. “You mean you know what it is?” 

“I thought I rounded them all up,” Dr. Gray replied, rubbing his moustache. 
He turned his pale blue eyes on me. “But I guess I missed one.” 

“What is it?” I demanded. “What kind of animal is it?” 

He shrugged. He tilted the box the other way, making the egg creature slide 
to the other end. Then he gently poked the eggy blob in the back. “This is a 
young one,” he said softly. 

“A young what?” I asked impatiently. 

“The eggs fell all over town,” Dr. Gray said, poking the egg creature. “Like 
a meteor shower. Only on this town.” 

“Excuse me?” I cried. “They fell from the sky?” I wanted desperately to 
understand. But so far, nothing made sense. 

Dr. Gray turned to me and put a hand on my shoulder. “We believe the eggs 
fell all the way from Mars, Dana. There was a big storm on Mars. Two years 
ago. It set off something like a meteor shower. The storm sent these eggs 
hurtling through space.” 

My mouth dropped open. I gazed down at the quivering yellow blob in the 
shoe box. “This—this is a Martian?” I stammered. 

Dr. Gray smiled. “We think it came from Mars. We think the eggs flew 
through space for two years.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. My heart was racing. My hands were suddenly 
ice cold. 

Was I really staring at a creature from Mars? 

Had I actually touched a Martian? 

Then I had an even weirder thought: I found it. I picked it up from my 
backyard. 

Did that mean it belonged to me? 

Did I own a Martian? 



Dr. Gray bounced the creature —my creature—in the box. Its veins pulsed. 
Its black eyes stared back at us. “We don’t know how the eggs made it through 
the earth’s atmosphere,” the scientist continued. 

“You mean they should have burned up?” I asked. 

He nodded. “Most everything burns up when it hits our atmosphere. But the 
eggs seem to be very tough. So tough they weren’t destroyed.” 

The egg creature made a gurgling sound. It plopped wetly against the side 
of the shoe box. 

Dr. Gray chuckled. “This is a cute one.” 

“You have a lot of others?” I asked. 

“Let me show you something, Dana.” Holding the box in front of him, Dr. 
Gray led the way through a large metal door. The door clanged heavily behind 
us. 

A long, narrow hallway—the walls painted white—led past several small 
rooms. Dr. Gray’s lab coat made a starchy, scratchy sound as he walked. At the 
end of the hall, we stopped in front of a wide window. 

“In there,” Dr. Gray said softly. 

I stared into the window. 

Then I stared harder. 

Was he crazy? Was he playing some kind of joke on me? 

“I—I can’t see anything at all!” I cried. 



15 


“Hold on a second. I forgot something,” Dr. Gray said. He stepped over to the 
wall and flicked a light switch. 

A light above our heads in the hallway flashed on. And now I could see 
through the window. 

“Oh, wow!” I exclaimed as my eyes swept over the large room on the other 
side of the glass. I stared at a crowd of egg creatures! 

Dozens of them. 

Yellow, eggy blobs. All pulsing and quivering. Green veins throbbing. 

The egg creatures huddled on the white tile floor. They looked like big 
globs of cookie dough on a baking sheet. Dozens of tiny, round black eyes stared 
out at us. 

Unreal! 

As I stared at them in amazement, I kept thinking they were like stuffed 
animals. But they weren’t. They were alive. They breathed. They shook and 
bounced and bubbled. 

“Would you like to go in?” Dr. Gray asked. 

He didn’t wait for me to answer. He pulled out a small black control unit 
from his pocket. He pushed a button, and the door swung open. Then he opened 
the door wider and guided me inside. 

“Whoa!” I uttered a cry when I felt a blast of cold air. “It’s freezing in 
here!” I exclaimed. 

Dr. Gray smiled. “We keep it very cold. It seems to keep them more alert.” 

He held the shoe box in one hand. He motioned to the egg creatures with 
the other. “Once they hatch, the creatures don’t like heat. If the temperature goes 
too high, they melt,” he explained. 

He lowered the box to the floor. “We don’t want them to melt,” he said. “If 
they melt, we can’t study them.” 

Leaning over the box, he lifted my egg creature out gently. He placed it 
beside three or four other egg creatures. All of the yellow blobs began bouncing 
excitedly. 

Dr. Gray picked up the box and stood back up. He smiled down at the new 
arrival. “We don’t want you to melt, do we?” he told it. “We want you to be nice 



and alert. So we keep it as cold in here as we can.” 

I shivered and rubbed my arms. I had goose-bumps all over my skin. From 
the excitement? Or from the cold? 

I wished I had worn something warmer than a T-shirt! 

The egg creatures bobbed and bubbled. I couldn’t take my eyes off them. 
Real creatures from Mars! 

I watched them start to bounce toward us. They moved surprisingly fast. 
They kind of rolled, kind of inched their way forward. They left slimy, yellow 
trails behind them as they moved. 

I wanted to ask Dr. Gray a million questions. “Do they have brains?” I 
asked. “Are they smart? Can they communicate? Have you tried talking to them? 
Do they talk to each other? How can they breathe our air?” 

He chuckled. “You have a good scientific mind, Dana,” he said. “Let’s take 
one question at a time. Which would you like me to answer first?” 

“Well—” I started to reply. But I stopped when I realized what the egg 
creatures had done. 

While Dr. Gray and I talked, they had all moved quickly into a circle. 

And now they had the two of us surrounded. 

I spun around. 

The egg creatures had moved behind us. They blocked the door. And now 
they were closing in on us, bubbling and throbbing, leaving a trail of slime as 
they slid forward. 

What were they planning to do? 



16 


In a panic, I turned to Dr. Gray. To my shock, he was grinning. 

“They—they’ve trapped us!” I stammered. 

He shook his head. “Sometimes they move like that. But don’t be scared, 
Dana. They’re harmless.” 

“Harmless?” I cried. My voice came out shrill and tiny. “But—but—” 

“What can they do?” Dr. Gray asked, placing a comforting hand on my 
trembling shoulder. “They’re only blobs of egg. They can’t bite you—can they? 
They don’t appear to have mouths. They can’t grab you. Or punch you. Or kick 
you. They have no hands or legs.” 

The egg creatures moved their circle closer. I watched them, my throat still 
tight, my legs shaking. 

I knew that what Dr. Gray was telling me was true. 

But why were they doing this? 

Why did they form a circle? Why were they closing in on us? 

“Sometimes they form triangles,” Dr. Gray told me. “Sometimes rectangles 
or squares. It’s as if they’re trying out different shapes they’ve seen. Maybe this 
is a way they’re trying to communicate with us.” 

“Maybe,” I agreed softly. I wished the egg creatures would back up. They 
were little, wet blobs. But they were really giving me the creeps! 

I shivered again. My breath steamed up in front of me. 

It was so cold, my glasses started to fog! 

I stared down at the egg creature I had brought. It had joined the circle. It 
bobbed and bounced with all the others. 

Dr. Gray turned and started to the door. I turned with him. I wanted to get 
out of that freezer as fast as I could! 

“Thank you for bringing that one in,” Dr. Gray said. He shook his head. “I 
thought I had collected them all. What a surprise that I missed one.” He 
scratched his hair. “You say you found it in your backyard?” 

I nodded. “It was an egg. But then it hatched in my dresser drawer.” My 
teeth chattered. I was so cold! 

“Does that mean it’s mine?” I asked Dr. Gray. “I mean, does it belong to 


me?” 



His smile faded. “I’m not really sure. I don’t know what the law is about 
alien creatures from outer space.” He frowned. “Maybe there is no law.” 

I glanced down at the little blob. The green veins along its side were 
bulging. Its whole body was throbbing like crazy. 

Was it sorry to see me go? 

No way. That’s really dumb, I told myself. 

“I guess you’ll want to keep it for a while and study it,” I said to Dr. Gray. 

He nodded. “Yes. I’m doing every kind of test I can think of.” 

“But can I come back and visit it?” I asked. 

Dr. Gray narrowed his eyes at me. “Come back? Dana, what do you mean 
by come back? You’re not leaving.” 



17 


“Excuse me?” I choked out. I knew I hadn’t heard him correctly. 

My whole body shook in a wild shiver. I rubbed my bare arms, trying to 
warm them. 

“Did you say I’m not leaving?” I managed to ask. 

Dr. Gray locked his pale blue eyes on mine. “I’m afraid you can’t leave, 
Dana. You must stay here.” 

A frightened cry escaped my throat. He wasn’t serious! He couldn’t be 
serious. 

He can’t keep me here, I told myself. 

No way. He can’t keep me here against my will. That’s against the law. 

“But... why?” I demanded weakly. “Why can’t I go home?” 

“You can understand—can’t you?” Dr. Gray replied calmly. “We don’t want 
anyone to know about these space aliens. We don’t want anyone to know that 
we’ve been invaded by Martians.” 

He sighed. “You don’t want to throw the whole world into a panic—do you, 
Dana?” 

“I—I—I—” I tried to answer. But I was too frightened. Too startled. Too 

cold. 

I glared angrily at Dr. Gray. “You have to let me go,” I insisted in a 
trembling whisper. 

His expression softened. “Please don’t stare at me like that,” he said. “I’m 
not a bad guy. I don’t want to frighten you. And I don’t want to keep you in this 
lab against your will. But what choice do I have? I’m a scientist, Dana. I have to 
do my job.” 

I stared back at him, my whole body shaking. I didn’t know what to say. 
My eyes moved to the metal door. It was shut. But he hadn’t bolted it. 

I wondered if I could get to the door before he did. 

“I have to study you too,” Dr. Gray continued. He tucked his hands into the 
pockets of his lab coat. “It’s my job, Dana.” 

“Study me?” I squeaked. “Why?” 

He motioned to my egg creature. “You touched it—didn’t you? You 
handled it? You picked it up?” 



I shrugged. “Well, yeah. I picked it up. So what?” 

“Well, we don’t know what kind of dangerous germs it gave you,” he 
replied. “We don’t know what kind of germs or bacteria or strange diseases these 
things carried with them from Mars.” 

I swallowed hard. “Huh? Diseases?” 

He scratched his moustache. “I don’t want to scare you. You’re probably 
perfectly okay. You feel okay—right?” 

My teeth chattered. “Yeah. I guess. Just cold.” 

“Well, I have to keep you here and study you. You know. Watch you 
carefully. Make sure that touching the egg creature didn’t harm you or change 
you.” 

No way, I thought. 

I don’t care about strange germs from Mars. I don’t care about egg diseases. 
I don’t care about science. 

All I care about is getting out of here. Getting home to my family. 

You’re not keeping me here, Dr. Gray. You’re not studying me. 

Because I’m outta here! 

Dr. Gray was saying something. I guess he was still explaining why he 
planned to keep me prisoner in this freezing cold lab. 

But I didn’t listen to him. Instead, I took off. 

I ran toward the big metal door. 

The circle of egg creatures blocked my way. But I leaped over them easily. 
And kept running. 

Gasping for breath, shivering, I reached the door. 

I grabbed the handle. And glanced back. 

Was Dr. Gray chasing after me? 

No. He hadn’t moved. 

Good! I thought. I caught him by surprise. 

I’m gone! 

I turned the door handle. Pulled hard. 

The door didn’t open. 

I pulled harder. 

It didn’t budge. 

I tried pushing it. 

No go. 

Dr. Gray’s voice rang in my ears. “The door is controlled electronically,” he 



said calmly. “It’s locked. It cannot be opened unless you have the control unit.” 

I didn’t believe him. I tugged again. Then I pushed again. 

He was telling the truth. The door was electronically sealed. 

I gave up with a loud cry of protest. I spun around to face him. “How long 
do I have to stay here?” I demanded. 

He replied in a low, icy voice. “Probably for a very long time.” 



18 


“Step away from the door, Dana,” Dr. Gray ordered. “Try to calm down.” 

Calm down? 

“YouTl be okay,” the scientist said. “I take very good care of my 
specimens.” 

Specimens ? 

I didn’t want to calm down. And I didn’t want to be a specimen. 

“I’m a boy. Not a specimen,” I told him angrily. 

I don’t think he heard me. He lifted me out of the way. Then he clicked the 
small remote unit in his hand. The door opened just long enough for him to slide 
through. 

It made a loud click as it snapped shut behind him. 

Locked in. I was locked in this freezer with three dozen Martians. 

My heart pounded. I heard a shrill whistle in my ears. My temples throbbed 
with pain. My whole head felt ready to explode! 

I’d never been so angry in my life. 

I let out a cry of rage. 

The egg creatures all began to chatter. I spun around in surprise. They 
sounded a little like chimps. 

A roomful of chimps, chattering away. 

Only they weren’t chimps. They were monsters from Mars. And I was 
locked in, all alone with them. 

A specimen. 

“Noooo!” I let out another howl and ran to the long window. 

“You can’t leave me here!” I shrieked. I pounded on the glass with both 

fists. 

I wanted to cry. I wanted to scream until my throat was raw. I’d never felt 
so angry and so frightened all at once. 

“Let me out! Dr. Gray—let me out of here! You can’t keep me here!” I 
screamed. I banged on the window as hard as I could. 

I’ll pound till I break the glass, I told myself. 

I’ll break through. Then I’ll climb out and escape. 



I beat my fists frantically against the glass. “Let me out of here! You can’t 
do this!” 

The glass was thick and hard. No way I could break through. 

“Let me out! ” I uttered a final scream. 

When I turned back into the room, the egg creatures stopped chattering. 
They stared up at me with their black, button eyes. 

They didn’t quiver or bounce. They stood totally still. As if they had frozen. 

I’m going to freeze! I realized. I rubbed my bare arms. But it didn’t help 
warm me. My hands were ice cold. 

Icicles are going to form on me, I thought. I’m going to freeze to death in 
here. I’m going to turn into a human Popsicle. 

The egg creatures stood so still. Their eyes were all locked on me. As if 
they were studying me. As if they were trying to decide what to do about me. 

Suddenly my egg creature broke the silence. I recognized it by the blue 
veins down its front. It started to chatter loudly. 

The other egg creatures turned, as if listening to it. 

Was it talking to them? Was it communicating in some weird Martian 
chatter language? 

“I hope you’re telling them all how I saved your life!” I called to it. “I hope 
you’re telling them what a good guy I am. You almost went down the drain— 
remember?” 

Of course the egg creature couldn’t understand me. 

I don’t know why I was shouting at it like that. I guess I was totally losing 
it. Totally freaked. 

As the egg creature chattered on, I stared at the others. They all listened in 
silence. I started to count them. There were so many of them—and so few of me! 

Were they friendly? Did they like strangers? Did they like humans? 

How did they feel about being locked up in this freezing cold room? 

Did they feel anything at all? 

These were questions I didn’t really want to know the answers to. 

I just wanted to get out of there. 

I decided to try the window again. But before I could move, my egg 
creature stopped talking. 

And the others started to move. 

Silently, they huddled together. Pressed together into a wide yellow wedge. 

And rolling faster than I could imagine, they attacked. 



19 


“Hey—!” I uttered a startled cry and backed up. 

The wedge of egg creatures rolled forward. Their bodies slapped the floor 
wetly as they bounced toward me. 

I retreated until my back hit the window. 

Nowhere to run. 

“What do you want?” I screamed. My voice came out high and tight in 
panic. “What are you going to do?” 

I turned and banged on the window again, pounding with open hands. “Dr. 
Gray! Dr. Gray! Help me!” 

Did they plan to roll over me? To swallow me up? 

To my surprise, the egg creatures stopped a few inches in front of me. They 
twirled and bounced until they had formed a circle once again. 

Then, moving quickly and silently, they shifted back into a big yellow 
triangle. 

I stared down at them, shivering, my teeth chattering. 

They’re not attacking, I decided. 

But what are they doing? 

Why are they forming these shapes? Are they trying to talk to me? 

I took a deep breath, trying to calm my panic. 

You’re a scientist, Dana, I reminded myself. Act like a scientist. Not a 
frightened kid. Try to talk back to them. 

I thought hard for a few seconds. Then I raised my hands in front of me. 
And I formed a circle with my pointer fingers and thumbs. 

I held the circle up so the egg creatures could all see it. And waited to see if 
they did anything. 

The yellow blobs had formed a wide triangle that nearly filled the room. I 
saw their round black eyes go up to the circle I had formed. 

And then I watched them bounce and roll—into a circle! 

Were they copying me? 

I straightened my fingers and thumbs into a triangle. 

And the egg creatures formed a triangle. 



Yes! 

We’re communicating! I realized. We’re talking to each other! 

I suddenly felt really excited. I felt like some kind of pioneer. 

I’m the first person on earth to communicate with Martians! I told myself. 
These creatures are friendly, I decided. They’re not dangerous. 

I didn’t really know that for sure. But I was so excited that I had 
communicated with them, I didn’t want to think anything bad about them. 

Dr. Gray has no right to keep them prisoner here, I thought. 

And he has no right to lock me up with them. 

I didn’t believe his excuse for keeping me here. Not for a minute. 

Just because I touched one? Just because I handled one? 

Did he really expect me to believe that touching an egg creature could harm 

me? 

Did he really think it would rot my skin off or something? 

Did he really think that touching an egg creature would give me a weird 
disease or change me in some way? 

That was just stupid. 

I carried that little yellow blob in my hands—and I felt perfectly fine. 

These creatures are my friends, I told myself. Touching them isn’t going to 
harm me in any way. 

But I’m a scientist. At least, I want to be a scientist. So I have to be 
scientific, I realized. 

I decided to check myself out—just to make sure. 

I raised my hands and inspected them carefully, first one, then the other. 
They looked okay to me. No strange rashes. No skin peeling off. I still had four 
fingers and a thumb on each hand. 

I rubbed my arms. They were the same too. Perfectly okay. 

Might as well check myself out all over, I told myself. 

I reached down and grabbed my left leg. 

Soft and mushy! 

“Oh no!” I wailed. 

I squeezed my leg again. Soft and lumpy. 

I didn’t have to look. I knew what was happening. 

I was slowly turning into one of them. I was turning into a lump of 
scrambled eggs! 



20 


“No. Oh, please—no.” 

I squeezed my mushy ankle. I couldn’t bear to look down. I didn’t want to 
see what was happening to me. 

But I had to. 

Slowly, I lowered my gaze. 

And saw that I was squeezing one of the egg creatures. Not my leg. 

I let go instantly and raised my hand. A relieved laugh escaped my throat. 
“Oh wow!” 

How could I think that mushy blob was my leg? 

I watched the little Martian scurry back to its pals. 

I shook my head. Even though no one else was around, I felt like a total 

jerk. 

Just calm down, Dana, I scolded myself. 

But how could I? 

The air in the lab seemed to get colder. I couldn’t stop shivering. I clamped 
my jaws tightly. But I couldn’t stop my teeth from chattering. 

I squeezed my nose. Cold and numb. I rubbed my ears. They were numb 

too. 

This is no joke, I thought, my throat tightening. I’m going to get frostbite. 
I’m really going to freeze. 

I tried thinking warm thoughts. I thought about the beach in summer. I 
thought about a blazing fire in the fireplace in our den. 

It didn’t help. 

A hard shiver made my whole body twitch. 

I’ve got to do something to take my mind off the cold, I decided. 

The egg creatures had spread out over the room. I raised my hands again 
and formed a triangle. 

They stared up at it, but didn’t move. 

I curled my fingers into a circle. 

They ignored this one too. 

“I guess you guys got bored, huh?” I asked them. 



I tried to bend my fingers and thumbs into a rectangle. But it was too hard. 
Fingers and thumbs can’t really bend into a rectangle. 

Besides, the egg creatures weren’t paying much attention to me. 

I’m going to freeze, I told myself again. Freeze. Freeze. Freeze. The word 
repeated in my mind until it became an unhappy chant. 

I lowered myself to the floor and pressed into the corner. I curled up, trying 
to save body warmth. Or what was left of it. 

A sound on the other side of the window made me jump up. 

Someone was coming. Dr. Gray? To let me out? 

I turned eagerly to the door. I heard footsteps out in the hall. Then a clink of 
metal. 

A slot opened just above the floor to the left of the door. A food tray slid in. 
It plopped onto the floor. 

I hurried over to it. Macaroni and cheese and a small container of milk. 

“But I hate macaroni and cheese!” I screeched. 

No reply. 

“I hate it! I hate it! I hate it!” I wailed. 

I was starting to lose it again. But I didn’t care. 

I leaned over the tray and held my hands over the plate of macaroni. The 
steam warmed my hands. 

At least it’s hot, I thought. 

I sat down on the floor and lifted the tray to my lap. Then I gulped down the 
macaroni, just for the warmth. 

It tasted horrible. I hate that wet, clotted, cheesy taste. But it did warm me 
up a little. 

I didn’t open the milk. Too cold. 

Feeling a little better, I shoved the tray aside and climbed to my feet. I 
strode over to the window and started pounding the glass with my fists. 

“Dr. Gray—let me out!” I shouted. “Dr. Gray—I know you can hear me. 
Let me out! You can’t lock me in here and make me eat macaroni and cheese! 
Let me out!” 

I screamed until my voice was hoarse. I didn’t hear a reply. Not a sound 
from the other side of the glass. 

I turned away from the window in disgust. 

“I’ve got to find a way out of here,” I said out loud. “I’ve got to!” 

And then, I had an idea. 



21 


Sad to say, it was a bad idea. 

The kind of idea you think of when you’re freezing to death in a total panic. 

What was the idea? To call home and tell Mom and Dad to come get me. 

The only problem with that idea was that there were no phones in the room. 

I searched carefully. There were metal shelves up to the ceiling against the 
back wall. They contained only scientific books and files. There was a desk in 
one corner. The desktop was bare. 

Nothing else. 

Nothing else in the whole room. Except for the dozens of egg creatures and 
me. 

I needed another idea, an idea that didn’t call for a telephone. 

But I was stumped. I tried the door again. I thought Dr. Gray might have 
gotten careless and left it unlocked. 

No such luck. 

I checked out the slot where my food tray had been delivered. It was only a 
few inches tall. Way too narrow for me to slip through. 

I was trapped. A prisoner. A specimen. 

I dropped glumly down to the floor and rested my back against the wall. I 
pulled up my knees and wrapped my arms around them. I curled into a ball, 
trying to stay warm. 

How long did Dr. Gray plan to keep me here? 

Forever? 

I let out a miserable sigh. But then a thought helped to cheer me. I suddenly 
had a little hope. 

I remembered something I had forgotten. I had told Anne where I was 
going! 

This morning in her backyard, I had told Anne I was going to take the egg 
creature to the science lab. 

I’m going to be rescued! I realized. 

I leaped to my feet and shot both fists into the air. I opened my mouth in a 
happy cheer. “Yesssss!” 



I knew exactly what would happen. 

When I don’t show up for dinner, Mom or Dad will call Anne. Because 
that’s where I’m always hanging out when I should be home for dinner. 

Anne will tell them I went to the science lab on Denver. 

Mom will say, “He should be back by now.” 

Dad will say, “I’d better go get him.” 

And Dad will come and rescue me. 

Only a matter of time, I knew. Only a matter of a few hours, and Dad will 
be here to get me out of this freezer. 

I felt so much better. 

I lowered myself back to the floor and leaned against the wall to wait. The 
egg creatures all stared at me. Watched me in silence. Trying to figure me out, I 
guess. 

I didn’t realize that I fell asleep. I guess I was worn out from all the 
excitement—and the fear. 

I’m not sure how long I slept. 

Voices woke me up. Voices from out in the hall. 

I sat up, instantly alert. And I listened. 

And heard Dad’s voice. 

Yes! 

He was here. He was about to rescue me. 

Yes! 

I climbed to my feet. I stretched. I got ready to greet Dad. 

And then, from the front hall, I heard Dr. Gray say, “I’m sorry, Mr. Johnson. 
Your son never stopped here.” 



22 


“Are you sure?” I heard Dad ask. 

“Very sure,” Dr. Gray replied. “I’m the only one here today. We’re closed. 
We had no visitors.” 

“He’s about this tall,” I heard Dad say. “He has dark hair, and he wears 
glasses.” 

“No. Sorry,” Dr. Gray insisted. 

“But he told his friend that he was coming here. He had something he 
wanted to show to a scientist. His bike is gone from the garage.” 

“Well, you can check outside for your son’s bike,” Dr. Gray told Dad. “But 
I don’t think you’ll find it.” 

He moved it! I realized. Dr. Gray moved my bike so no one would find it! 

I let out a shout of rage and ran to the window. “Dad—I’m in here!” I 
shouted. I cupped my hands around my mouth so my voice would be even 
louder. “Dad! Can you hear me? I’m in here! Dad?” 

I took a deep breath and listened. My heart was thudding so loudly, I could 
barely hear their voices from the front. 

Dad and Dr. Gray continued talking in low, calm voices. 

“Dad! Can’t you hear me?” I screamed. “It’s me, Dana! Come back here, 
Dad! I’m here! Come let me out!” 

My voice cracked. My throat ached from screaming so loud. 

“Dad— please! ” 

My chest heaving, I pressed my ear against the window and listened again. 

“Well, it’s very strange, Mr. Johnson,” Dr. Gray was saying. “The boy never 
came here. Would you like to look around the lab?” 

Yes, Dad! I pleaded silently. Say yes. 

Tell him that you’d like to look around the lab, Dad! Please! 

“No, thanks,” I heard Dad say. “I’d better keep searching. Thank you, Dr. 
Gray.” 

I heard Dad say good-bye. 

I heard the front door close. 

And I knew I was doomed. 



23 


“I don’t believe this,” I murmured out loud. “Dad was so close. So close!” 

I sank back to the floor. I felt as if my heart were sinking too. I wanted to 
keep dropping, down onto the floor, into the ground. Just keep sinking till I 
disappeared forever. 

My throat ached from screaming. Why couldn’t Dad hear me? I could hear 

him. 

And why did he believe Dr. Gray’s lies? Why didn’t Dad check out the lab 
for himself? 

He would see me through the window. And I would be rescued. 

Dr. Gray is evil, I realized. He pretends to be interested only in science. He 
pretended to be worried about my health, about my safety. He said that’s why he 
was keeping me here—to make sure I was safe. 

But he lied to my father. 

And he was lying to me. 

Crouched on the floor, I shivered as the frigid air seemed to seep right 
through my skin. I shut my eyes and lowered my head. 

I wanted to stay calm. I knew I had to stay calm to think clearly. But I 
couldn’t. The chills I felt running down my back weren’t just from the cold. 
They were also from terror. 

Voices in the front snapped me to attention. I held my breath and listened. 

Was that my dad? 

Or was I starting to hear things? 

“Maybe I will take a look around.” That’s what I thought I heard Dad say. 

Was I dreaming it? 

No. I heard Dr. Gray mumble something. Then I heard Dad say, 
“Sometimes Dana sneaks into places where he doesn’t belong. He’s so interested 
in science, he may have sneaked in through a back door, Dr. Gray.” 

“Yes!” I cried happily. Every time I lost all hope, I somehow got another 
chance. 

I jumped up and hurried to the window. I crossed my fingers and prayed 
Dad would walk to the back and see me. 

After a few seconds, I saw Dad and Dr. Gray at the far end of the long, 



white hall. Dr. Gray was leading him slowly, opening doors. They peered into 
each lab, then moved on. 

“Dad!” I called. “Can you hear me? I’m back here!” 

Even though I had my face pressed up to the window glass, he couldn’t hear 
me. 

I banged on the glass. Dad kept walking with Dr. Gray. He didn’t look up. 

I waited for them to come closer. My heart was banging against my chest 
now. My mouth was dry. I pressed up close to the window. 

In a few seconds, Dad would peer into the window and see me standing 

here. 

And then I would be out—and Dr. Gray would have some real explaining to 
do. 

With my hands and nose pressed against the glass, I watched them move 
forward. The hall was dark on this end. But I could see them clearly as they 
peeked into the labs at the other end. 

“Dad!” I shouted. “Dad—over here!” 

I knew he couldn’t hear me. But I had to shout anyway. 

The two men disappeared into a lab for a few seconds. Then they came out 
and stepped toward me. 

They were talking in low tones. I couldn’t hear what they were saying. 

Dad had his eyes on Dr. Gray. 

Turn this way, Dad, I silently urged. Please—look to the end of the hall 
Look in the window. 

Chatting softly, they disappeared through another door. 

What on earth are they talking about? I wondered. 

A few seconds later, they were back in the hall. Moving this way. 

Dad — please! Here I am! I pressed up eagerly against the glass. 

I pounded my fists on the window. 

Dad looked up. 

And stared into the window. 

He stared right at me. 

I’m rescued! I realized. 

I’m outta here! 

Dad stared at me for a few seconds. 

Then he turned back to Dr. Gray. “Thanks for showing me around,” he said. 
“Dana definitely isn’t here. Sorry I wasted your time.” 



24 


“Dad—I’m right here!” I shrieked. “You’re looking right at me!” 

Was I invisible? 

Why didn’t he see me? 

“Sorry I wasted your time, Dr. Gray,” I heard Dad say again. 

“Good luck in finding Dana,” Dr. Gray replied. “I’m sure he’ll turn up 
really soon. He’s probably at a friend’s house and forgot the time. You know 
how kids are.” 

“Nooooooo!” I let out a long wail. “Dad—come back! Dad!” 

As I stared in horror, Dad turned away and started back down the long hall. 
With another cry, I began to pound on the window glass with both fists. 
“Dad! Dad! Dad!” I chanted with each slam of my fist. 

Dad turned around. “What’s that noise?” he asked Dr. Gray. 

Dr. Gray turned too. 

I pounded the glass even harder. I pounded until my knuckles were raw and 
throbbing. “Dad! Dad! Dad!” I continued to chant. 

“What’s that pounding noise?” Dad demanded from halfway down the hall. 
“It’s the pipes,” Dr. Gray told him. “I’ve been having a lot of trouble with 
the pipes. The plumber is coming on Monday.” 

Dad nodded. 

He kept walking. I heard him say good-bye to the scientist. Then I heard the 
door close behind him. 

I knew that this time he wouldn’t come back. 

I didn’t move from the window. I stared through the glass down the long 

hall. 

A few seconds later, I saw Dr. Gray coming toward me. He had an angry 
scowl on his face. 

I’m his prisoner now, I thought glumly. 

What does he plan to do? 



25 


He stopped outside the window. He clicked on the hall light. 

In the bright light, I could see beads of sweat on his forehead. He frowned 
and stared in at me with those cold blue eyes. 

“Nice try, Dana,” he said sourly. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” I choked out. My legs were trembling. Not 
from the cold. I was really terrified now. 

“You almost got your father’s attention,” Dr. Gray replied. “That wouldn’t 
have been nice. That would have spoiled my plans.” 

I pressed both palms against the glass. I tried to force myself to stop 
trembling. 

“Why couldn’t Dad see me?” I demanded. 

Dr. Gray rubbed a hand over his side of the window. “It’s one-way glass,” 
he explained. “No one can see into the room from the hall—unless I turn on the 
bright hall light.” 

I let out a long sigh. “You mean—?” 

“Your father saw only blackness,” the scientist said with a pleased grin. “He 
thought he was staring into an empty room. Just the way you did—until I turned 
on the light.” 

“But why didn’t he hear me?” I demanded. “I was shouting my head off.” 

Dr. Gray shook his head. “A waste of time. The room you are in is totally 
soundproof. Not a sound escapes into the hall.” 

“But I can hear you!” I declared. “I could hear every word you and Dad 
said. And now you can hear me.” 

“There is a speaker system in the wall,” he explained. “I can turn it on and 
off with the same control unit that locks the door.” 

“So I could hear you, but you couldn’t hear me,” I murmured. 

“You’re a very smart boy,” he replied. His blue eyes flashed. “I know 
you’re smart enough not to try any more tricks in there.” 

“You have to let me out!” I screamed. “You can’t keep me here!” 

“Yes, I can,” he replied softly. “I can keep you here as long as I like, Dana.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. I was so frightened, I couldn’t speak. 

“It’s my duty to keep you in there,” Dr. Gray said calmly. He didn’t care 



that I was so scared and upset. He didn’t care about me at all, I realized. 

He must be crazy, I decided. 

Crazy and evil. 

“It’s my duty to keep you here,” he repeated. “I must make sure that the egg 
creatures haven’t harmed you. I must make sure that the egg creatures haven’t 
given you strange germs that you might pass on to others.” 

“Let me out!” I shrieked. I was too frightened and angry to argue with him 
now. Too angry and frightened to think clearly. “Let me out! Let me out!” I 
demanded, pounding on the glass with my aching fists. 

“Get some rest, Dana,” he instructed. “Don’t tire yourself out, son. I want to 
start doing tests on you in the morning. I have many, many tests to perform.” 

“But I’m f-freezing!” I stammered. “Let me out of here. At least let me stay 
somewhere warm. Please?” 

He ignored my plea. He clicked off the hall light and turned away. 

I watched him make his way down the long hall. He disappeared through a 
door in front. And closed the door hard behind him. 

I stood there, trembling, my heart pounding. 

I was cold—and very scared. 

I had no way of knowing things were about to get a lot scarier! 



26 


I was so desperate to get Dad’s attention, I nearly forgot about the egg creatures. 
Now I turned from the window to find them scattered around the room. 

They stood still as statues. They didn’t bounce or quiver. They all seemed to 
be staring at me. 

Dr. Gray had turned off all the lights except for a tiny, dim bulb in the 
ceiling. The little egg blobs appeared pale and gray in the dim light. 

I felt a chill at the back of my neck. 

Was it safe to go to sleep in the same room with them? 

I suddenly felt exhausted. So tired that all my muscles ached. My head 
spun. 

I needed sleep. 

I knew I had to rest so I could be alert and sharp tomorrow. Alert and sharp 
so I could find a way to escape. 

But if I fell asleep, what would the egg creatures do? 

Would they leave me alone? Would they sleep too? 

Or would they try to harm me in some way? 

Were they good? Were they evil? 

Were they intelligent at all? 

I had no way of knowing. 

I only knew I couldn’t stay awake much longer. 

I dropped down to the floor and curled up in the corner. I tried to stay warm 
by tucking myself into a ball. 

But it didn’t help. The cold swept over me. My nose was frozen. My ears 
were numb. My glasses were frozen to my face. 

Even wrapped up tightly, I couldn’t stop shaking. 

I’m going to freeze to death, I realized. 

When Dr. Gray comes back tomorrow morning, he’ll find me on the floor. 
A solid lump of ice. 

I gazed at the egg creatures. They stared back at me in the dim light. 

Silence. 

Such heavy silence in the room that I wanted to scream. 



“Aren’t you cold?” I cried out to them. My voice came out hoarse, weak 
from all the screaming I had done. “Aren’t you freezing to death too?” I asked 
them. “How can you guys stand it?” 

Of course they didn’t reply. 

“Dana, you’re totally losing it,” I scolded myself out loud. 

I was trying to talk to a bunch of egg lumps from another planet! Did I 
really expect them to answer me? 

They stared back in silence. None of them quivered. None of them moved. 
Their little dark eyes glowed in the dim light from the ceiling. 

Maybe they’re asleep, I thought. 

Maybe they sleep with their eyes open. That’s why they’re not moving. 
That’s why they’ve stopped bouncing. They’re sound asleep. 

That made me feel a little better. 

I tucked myself into a tighter ball, and I tried to fall asleep too. If only I 
could stop shivering. 

I closed my eyes and silently repeated the word, “sleep, sleep, sleep” in my 
mind. 

It didn’t help. 

And when I opened my eyes, I saw the egg creatures start to move. 

I was wrong. They weren’t asleep. 

They were wide awake. And they were all moving together. All moving at 
once. 

Coming to get me. 



27 


“Ohhh.” A low moan escaped from my throat. 

I was already shaking all over from the cold. But now my entire body 
shuddered from fear. 

The egg creatures moved with surprising speed. 

They were bunching together in the center of the room. Pressing into each 
other, making wet smacking sounds. 

I tried to climb to my feet. But my legs didn’t work. 

My knees bent like rubber, and I landed back on the floor. I pressed back 
into the corner—and watched them move. 

They slapped up against each other. Loud, wet slaps. 

And as they pushed together, they rolled forward. Rolled toward me. 

“What are you doing?” I cried in a high, shrill voice. “What are you going 
to do to me?” 

They didn’t reply. 

The wet smacks echoed through the room as the eggy creatures threw 
themselves into each other. 

“Leave me alone!” I shrieked. Once again I tried to stand. I made it to my 
knees. But I was trembling too hard to balance on two feet. 

“Leave me alone—please! I’ll help you guys escape too!” I promised. 
“Really. I’ll help you escape—tomorrow. Just let me make it through the night.” 

They didn’t seem to understand. 

They didn’t seem to hear me! 

What are they doing? I asked myself, watching them creep forward. Why 
are they doing this? 

They had waited until I nearly fell asleep, I realized. 

That means they wanted to catch me off guard. They wanted to sneak up on 
me. 

Because they were about to do something I wasn’t going to like. Something 
I wasn’t going to like at all. 

I pressed my back against the wall. 

The egg creatures moved quickly now, pale in the gray light. 



Squinting hard at them, I realized to my horror that they had all stuck 
themselves together. 

They were no longer dozens of little egg creatures. 

Now they had joined together to form one enormous egg creature! 

I was staring at a big, quivering wall of egg! A wall so big it nearly covered 
the floor of the room. 

A wall that was rolling toward me. Rolling to get me. 

“Whoa! Please—whoa!” I choked out. 

I knew I should climb to my feet. I knew I should try to run. 

But where could I run? 

How could I escape from this huge, solid egg wall? 

I couldn’t. 

So I lay there and watched it come. Too frozen. Too frozen to move. 
“Ohhhh.” I moaned as the front of the wall of eggs rose up over my shoes. 

It was moving so fast now. Crawling somehow. 

Crawling over me. 

The egg wall swept over my shoes. Over the legs of my jeans. Over my 
waist. 

I lay there helpless as it swept over me. 

Too frozen. Too frozen. 

Helpless, as it poured over me. 

Trapping me beneath it. 

Smothering me. 



28 


I should have moved. 

I should have fought it. 

Too late. Too late now. 

The sticky, warm egg creatures—all glued together—rolled over me like a 
heavy carpet. 

I pushed up both arms. I raised my knees. I tried to squirm away. 

Too late. 

I tried to roll out from underneath. But the heavy, living carpet had me 
pinned on my back. Pinned to the floor. 

It rolled over my waist. And then quickly, over my chest. 

Was it going to sweep over my head? Was it going to smother me? 

I punched at it with both fists. 

But it was too late to push it away. Too late to do it any harm. 

Too late to stop it as it crept closer to my neck. So warm and heavy. 

I twisted my head from side to side. I tried to roll away. 

But it was no use. 

Too late. Too late to fight back. 

And now I lay there, trapped. And felt it creep up to my chin. 

Felt it throbbing. Pulsing. 

Dozens of eggy monsters all pressed together. Alive. A living sheet of egg 
creatures. Covering me. 

Covering me. 

I took a deep breath and held it as the heavy, warm carpet pressed itself 
against my chin. My arms and legs were pinned to the floor. I couldn’t squirm 
away. 

I couldn’t move. 

To my surprise, the egg carpet stopped under my chin. 

I let out a long whoosh of air. 

And waited. 

Had it really stopped? 

Yes. 



It didn’t crawl over my head. It rested heavily on top of me. Throbbing 
steadily, as if it had two dozen heartbeats. 

So warm. 

I felt so warm beneath it. Almost cozy. 

I let out a sigh. For the first time, I had stopped shivering. My hands and 
feet were no longer frozen. No chills ran down my back. 

Warm. I felt toasty and warm. 

A smile spread over my face. I could feel my fear fading away with the 

cold. 

The egg creatures weren’t trying to harm me, I realized. 

They wanted to help me. 

They pressed themselves together to form a blanket. A warm and cozy 
blanket. 

They worked together to keep me from freezing. 

They saved my life! 

With the warm, pulsing blanket on top of me, I suddenly felt calm. And 
sleepy. I drifted into a peaceful, dreamless sleep. 

Such a wonderful, soothing sleep. 

But it didn’t help get me ready for the horrors of the next morning. 



29 


I awoke a couple of times during the night. At first, I felt alarmed and frightened 
when I saw that I wasn’t home in bed. 

But the pulsing, warm egg blanket relaxed me. I shut my eyes and drifted 
back to sleep. 

Some time in the morning, I was aroused from a deep sleep by an angry 
voice. I felt hands grab my shoulders roughly. 

Someone was shaking me hard. Shaking me awake. 

I opened my eyes to find Dr. Gray bending over me in his white lab coat. 
His face was twisted in anger. He shook me hard, shouting furiously. 

“Dana—what have you done? What have you done to the egg monsters?” 

“Huh?” I was still half asleep. My eyes struggled to focus. My head bobbed 
loosely on my shoulders as the angry scientist shook me. 

“Let go!” I finally managed to choke out. 

“What have you done to them?” Dr. Gray demanded. “How did you turn 
them into a blanket?” 

“I—I didn’t!” I stammered. 

He uttered a furious growl. “You’ve ruined everything!” he shrieked. 

“Please—” I started, struggling to wake up. 

He let go of me and grabbed the egg blanket in both hands. “What have you 
done, Dana?” he repeated. “Why did you do this?” 

With another cry of rage, he ripped the blanket off me—and heaved it 
against the wall. 

The egg creatures made a soft splat as they hit the lab wall. I heard them 
utter tiny squeals of pain. The blanket folded limply to the floor. 

“You shouldn’t do that, Dr. Gray!” I screamed, finally finding my voice. I 
jumped to my feet. I could still feel the warmth of the egg blanket on my skin. 

“You hurt them!” I shrieked. 

I gazed down at the yellow blanket. It bubbled silently where it had been 
thrown. It didn’t move. 

“You let them touch you?” Dr. Gray demanded, twisting his face in disgust. 
“You let them cover you up?” 

“They saved my life!” I declared. “They pushed together to make a warm 



blanket—and they saved my life!” 

I glanced down again. The egg creatures remained stuck together. The 
blanket appeared to be seething now. Throbbing hard. As if excited. Or angry. 

“Are you crazy?” Dr. Gray cried, his face red with anger. “Are you crazy? 
You let these monsters rest on top of you? You touched them? You handled 
them? Are you trying to destroy my discovery? Are you trying to destroy my 
work?” 

He’s the crazy one, I realized. Dr. Gray isn’t making any sense. He isn’t 
making any sense at all. 

He moved quickly—and grabbed me again. Held me in a tight grip so I 
couldn’t escape. And pulled me to the door. 

“Let go of me! Where are you taking me?” I demanded. 

“I thought you could be trusted,” Dr. Gray replied in a menacing growl. 
“But I was wrong. I’m so sorry, Dana. So sorry. I had hoped to keep you alive. 
But I see now that is impossible.”

He dragged me to the door. He stopped and reached into the pocket of his lab 
coat. Reached for the control unit to open the door. 

I saw my chance. He had me by only one hand. 

With a hard burst of strength, I pulled away. 

He let out a cry. Reached both hands for me. 

Missed. 

I ran to the other side of the lab. I turned at the wall to face him. 

He had a strange smile on his face. “Dana, there’s nowhere to run,” he said 
softly. 

My eyes flashed around the room. I don’t know what I was searching for. I 
had seen it all. And I knew that he was telling the truth. 

Dr. Gray stood blocking the only door. The long window was too heavy and 
thick to break through. And it didn’t open. 

There were no other windows. No other doors. 

No ways to escape. 

“What are you going to do now, Dana?” Dr. Gray asked softly, the strange 
smile stuck on his face. His blue eyes locked coldly on mine. “Where are you 
going to go?” 

I opened my mouth to reply. But I had nothing to say. 

“I’ll tell you what’s going to happen,” Dr. Gray said softly, calmly. “You’re 
going to stay in here. In this cold, cold room. I’m going to leave you now and 
make sure you’re locked in.” 

His smile grew wider. “Then do you know what I’m going to do? Do you?” 

“What?” I choked out. 

“I’m going to make it colder in here. I’m going to make it colder than a 
freezer.” 

“No—!” I protested. 

His smile faded. “I trusted you, Dana. I trusted you. But you broke that 
trust. You let them touch you. You let them form this—this carpet! You ruined 
them, Dana! You ruined my egg monsters!” 

“I—I didn’t do anything!” I stammered. I balled my hands into fists. But I 
felt so helpless. Helpless and afraid. 



“You can’t freeze me in here!” I cried. “I didn’t do anything! You can’t 
leave me in here to freeze!” 

“Of course I can,” Dr. Gray replied coldly. “This is my lab. My own little 
world. I can do whatever I want.” 

He pulled the little black remote unit from his lab coat pocket. He pointed it 
at the door and pushed a button. 

The door swung open. 

He started to leave. “Good-bye, Dana,” he called.

“No—stop!” I called. 

Dr. Gray turned from the doorway. 

And as he turned, the blanket of egg creatures rose up. 

It stood straight up—and flung itself over him. It dropped on top of the 
scientist with a hard thud. 

“Hey—” He let out an angry cry. The cry was muffled by the heavy yellow 
blanket of egg creatures. 

The egg blanket covered him. I watched him struggle underneath it. And I 
listened to his muffled cries. 

He was squirming and twisting beneath the blanket. But he couldn’t toss it 
off. And he couldn’t slide out from under it. 

He crumpled to the floor, and the blanket crumpled with him. 

I watched it seething and bubbling on top of him. 

Then I didn’t wait another second. I took a deep breath—and I ran across 
the room. I darted past the egg blanket with Dr. Gray twisting and thrashing 
underneath it. 

Out the door. 

Down the long hall to the front of the lab. 

Yes! A few seconds later, I pushed open the front door and burst outside. 
Breathing hard, sucking in the sweet, fresh air. 

A beautiful morning. A red ball of a sun still rising over the spring-green 
trees. The sky clear and blue. 

I glanced around. I could see a paperboy on his bike halfway up the block. 
No one else on the street. 

I turned and ran around to the side of the building. The grass smelled so 
wonderful! The morning air so warm and fresh. I was so thrilled to be outside! 

I had to get home. 

I had a hunch—and the hunch was right. I spotted my bike, resting against 
the back wall of the lab, hidden by a large Dumpster. 

I leaped onto it and started to pedal. Riding a bike never felt as exciting, so 
thrilling! 

I was getting away, away from the horror of crazy Dr. Gray and his freezing 



lab. 


I pedaled faster. I rode without stopping. Without seeing! The world was a 
blur of green. 

I must have set a speed record for getting home. 

I roared up the driveway, the tires sending gravel flying on both sides. 

Then I jumped off my bike and let it topple to the grass. I dove for the 
kitchen door and burst into the kitchen. “Mom!” I cried. 

She jumped up from the breakfast table. I caught the worried expression on 
her face. It melted away as I ran into the room. 

“Dana!” she cried. “Where were you? We’ve all been so terrified. The 
police are looking for you and—and—” 

“I’m okay!” I told her. I gave her a quick hug. 

Dad ran in from the hallway. “Dana—you’re okay? Where were you all 
night? Your mother and I—” 

“Egg monsters!” I cried. “Egg monsters from Mars! Hurry!” I grabbed 
Dad’s hand and tugged. “Come on!” 

“Huh?” Dad spun around. He narrowed his eyes, studying me. “What did 
you say?” 

“No time to explain!” I gasped. “They’ve got Dr. Gray. He’s evil, Dad. He’s 
so evil!” 

“Who has what?” Mom demanded. 

“The egg creatures! From Mars! Hurry! There’s no time!” 

They didn’t move. I saw them exchange glances. 

Mom stepped forward and placed a hand on my forehead. “Do you have a 
fever, Dana? Are you sick?” 

“No!” I screamed. “Listen to me! Egg creatures from Mars! Follow me!” 

I know I wasn’t explaining myself too well. But I was frantic. 

“Dana—come lie down,” Mom instructed. “I’ll call Dr. Martin.” 

“No—please! I don’t need a doctor!” I protested. “Just follow me—okay? 
You’ve got to see them. You’ve got to see the egg creatures. You’ve got to 
hurry.” 

Mom and Dad exchanged worried glances again. 

“I’m not crazy!” I shrieked. “I want you to come with me to the science 

lab!” 

“Okay, okay,” Dad finally agreed. “You were in that lab last night?” 

“Yes,” I told him, shoving him to the kitchen door. “I called and called. But 



you couldn’t hear me.” 

“Oh, wow,” Dad murmured, shaking his head. “Wow.” 

The three of us climbed into the car. 

It took about three minutes to drive to the lab. Dad parked in front. I 
jumped out of the car before he stopped. 

The front door to the lab stood wide open, as I’d left it. 

I ran inside with Mom and Dad close behind me. 

“They’re egg creatures,” I told them breathlessly. “They dropped down 
from Mars. They captured Dr. Gray.” 

I led the way down the long hall. 

I pushed open the door to the freezing back room. 

Mom and Dad stepped in behind me. 

I gazed around the room—and gasped in amazement!

I saw Mom and Dad staring at me. They had worried expressions on their faces. 
“Where are the egg creatures?” Mom demanded softly. 

Dad rested a hand gently on my shoulder. “Where are they, Dana?” he 
asked in a whisper. 

“Uh... they’re gone,” I choked out. 

The lab stood empty. 

No Dr. Gray. No egg creatures. No one. 

Bare white walls. Nothing on the floor. 

Nothing. 

“Maybe they went back to Mars,” I murmured, shaking my head. 

“And Dr. Gray? What about Dr. Gray?” Dad asked. 

“Maybe they took Dr. Gray with them,” I replied. 

“Let’s go home,” Mom sighed. “Let’s get you into bed, Dana.” 

Dad guided me from the room, his hands on my shoulders. “I’ll call Dr. 
Martin,” he said softly. “I’m sure we can get him to come to the house this 
morning.” 

“I—I do feel a little strange,” I admitted. 

So they drove me home and tucked me into bed. 

The doctor came later that morning and examined me. He didn’t find 
anything wrong. But he said I should stay in bed and rest for a while. 

I knew that Mom and Dad didn’t believe my story. I felt bad about that. But 
I didn’t know how to convince them I was telling the truth. 

I did feel a little weird. 

Just tired, I guess. 

I dozed off and woke up and dozed off again. 

In the afternoon, I woke up to hear my sister Brandy talking to some friends 
outside my room. “Dana totally freaked out,” I heard Brandy say. “He says he 
was kidnapped by egg monsters from Mars.” 

I heard Brandy’s friends giggling. 

Oh great, I thought bitterly. Now everyone thinks I’m a nut case. 



I wanted to call Brandy into my room and tell her what really happened. I 
wanted to make her believe me. I wanted to make someone believe me. 

But how? 

I fell asleep again. 

I was awakened by a voice calling my name. I sat up in bed. The voice 
floated in from my open bedroom window. 

I climbed out of bed and made my way to the window. Anne was calling me 
from the driveway. “Dana—are you okay? Do you want to come over? I got a 
new CD-ROM version of Battle Chess. ” 

“Cool!” I called down to Anne. “I’ll be right over.” 

I pulled on a T-shirt and a pair of jeans. I was feeling pretty good. Rested. 
Like my old self. 

So happy that everything was back to normal. 

I hummed to myself as I brushed my hair. I stared at myself in the mirror. 

You had an amazing adventure, Dana, I told myself. Imagine—you spent a 
night with egg creatures from Mars! 

But now you’re okay, and your life is back to normal. 

I felt so happy, I gave Brandy a hug on my way down the stairs. She stared 
at me as if I truly were crazy! 

Humming loudly, I made my way out the kitchen door and started across 
the yard to Anne’s house. 

Everything looked so beautiful to me. The grass. The trees. The spring 
flowers. The sun setting behind the trees. 

What a day! What a beautiful, perfect, normal day! 

And then halfway across Anne’s lawn, I stopped. 

I crouched down on the grass—and I laid the biggest egg you ever saw!
