Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter #1) - Page 17/17
It was Quirrell.

"you!" Harry sighed.

Queer smiled. His face wouldn’t move at all.

"I," she said calmly. "I wondered if I'd join you here, Potter."

"But I think -- Snap --."

"Severus?" Quirrell laughed, it wasn't his usual triangle laugh, but cold and hard. "Yeah, Cio is like that, isn't he? It's important that he bounces around like an overfed turtle. Besides him, who would doubt pp-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?"

Harry couldn't take it if it couldn't be true, he couldn't.

"But Snape tried to kill me!"

"No, no, no. I didn't try to kill you. Your girlfriend Granger pushed me over the edge when she ran over and opened fire on Snape, right next to Quiet. She glared at you. A few seconds Another, I got you off that broom I could have handled it if Snape wasn't muttering a curse and trying to .to save you."

"Snape was trying to save me?"

"Of course," Quirrell said coldly. "Why do you think he wanted to participate in your next tournament? He was insisting that I never made it. Funny indeed... He didn't have to worry. I couldn't care less if Dambudoro was watching ." All the other teachers thought that Snape was trying to prevent Gryffindor from winning by making himself available to the humans… and what a waste of time, when that's all I'm going to kill you tonight."

-- advertisement --
Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes appeared out of thin air and wrapped around Harry.

"You were very lucky to be alive, Potter. Running around the school during Halloween as I knew you had seen me coming to see who was protecting the stone."

"You let the torturer in?"

"Indeed. I have a special fondness for trolls -- you must know the one I made who's in the room over there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for him, Snape, who was already hesitant to leave, It now went to the third floor and discovered me—and not only did my dog ​​beat you to death; The three-headed dog didn’t even manage to properly bite Snape’s leg.

"Now, think of it, Potter, I need to see this wonderful spectacle."

It was then that Harry realized what was behind Quinn. It was Eris’s spell.

"This mirror is the key to finding the stone," Quirrell spoke, punching his way around the frame. "You trust Dumbledore to come up with something like that… but he's in London… I'll be far away by the time he gets back…."

All Harry could think to do was keep Quirrell talking and try to stop him from paying attention to the mirror.

"I saw you and Snape in the woods -- " he broke out.

"Yeah," Quirrell said casually, walking around the mirror to check the back. "He was with me at the time, trying to figure out where I got to. He was always suspicious of me. He threatened me -- as he probably did when I was Lord Voldemort thought..."

Quirrell stepped back from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.

"I see the stone... I will show it to my Lord... but where is it?"

Harry fought against the ropes that bound him, but they wouldn't give. He had to stop Quirrell from paying full attention to the mirror.

"But Snape always seemed to hate me more."

"Oh, he knows," Queer said slowly, "Heaven's right, yeah. He was at Hogwarts with your father, don't you know that? They hated each other. But he didn't want you to die."

"But I heard you a few days ago crying -- I thought Snape was scaring you…."

For the first time, a look of panic crossed Quirrell's face.

"Sometimes," she said, "I find it hard to obey my master's orders -- he is a mighty wizard and I am not weak --."

"You mean he was in class with you?" Harry sighed.

"Everywhere I go, he's with me," Quinn said quietly. "I met him when I traveled the universe. I was a smart teenager then, with conflicting ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, only power There are, and those too weak to seek it out… Since then, I’ve served her well, even though I’ve let her down a few times. Quirrel shuddered, "He doesn't forgive mistakes easily. When I couldn't steal the stone from Gringotts, he wasn't happy. He bullied me... decided he was too controlling..."

Quirrel's voice is off. Harry could remember walking down Iagon's street -- how stupid could he be? He saw Quirrell there that day and held hands with him in a flowing fermentation tank.

Quirrell cursed under his breath.

"I don't understand... Is there a stone in the mirror? Should I break it?"

Harry's mind was racing.

The one I want more than anything in the world right now, he thought, to get the stone before Quirrell. So when I look in the mirror, I try to find it -- which means I see where it's hiding! But how can I watch if Quirrell doesn’t know what I’m doing?

He tried to move to the left, to get in front of the mirror without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he was hit and fell. Quirrell glared at him. He was talking to himself.

"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!"

To Harry's horror, a voice answered, and it seemed to come from Quirrell himself.

"Use a man... a man's work..."

Quirrel circled Harry.

"Yes -- Potter -- come here."

He waved his hand once and the ropes that had bound Harry fell off. Harry slowly rose to his feet.

"Come here," Quinn ordered. "Look in the mirror and tell me what you see."

Harry walked towards her.

I must be lying, he thought disgustedly. I have to look and not lie, it’s just who I am.

Quirrel moved close behind him. Harry inhaled a funny scent that seemed to be coming from Quirrell's den. She closed her eyes and went in front of the mirror and opened them again.

She saw his film, it was black, and at first she was intimidated. But after a while, the thought smiled at him. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. He frowned and put the stone in his pocket -- and as he did, Harry felt something heavy fall into his pocket. Somehow -- miraculously -- he found the stone.

"good?" Queer said impatiently. "What do you see?"

Harry lost his virginity.

"I see myself holding hands with Dumbledore," he invented. "I -- I got the horse cup for Gryffindor."

Quirrell cursed again.

"Get out of the way," he said. As Harry shifted, he felt a magic stone at his feet. Can you take a break from that?

But he had not walked five steps before a distant voice spoke, though Quirrell was not moving his lips.

"He's lying... He's lying..."

"Get back here, Potter!" Quirrell shouted. "Tell me the truth! What did you just see?"

The high-pitched voice spoke again.

"Let me talk to him...face and eyes..."

"You don't have the power, Master."

"I have the power… for this…."

Harry felt like the Devil's rope was throbbing there. He couldn’t move a muscle. Frustrated, he looked at Quirrell and reached over and began to stretch his cock. What was going on? The crown fell. Queer's head looked like it wasn't full. Then he turned slowly towards the room.

Harry wanted to scream but couldn't get a sound out. Where the back should have been at the top of Kurt's head was a face, the ugliest face Harry had ever seen. He was white with red eyes and a snake-like nose.

"Harry Potter… " she whispered.

Harry tried to take a step back, but his legs wouldn't move.

"See what I've become?" Face said. "It's just shadow and wind... I can control someone else's body... but there have always been people who can let me into their hearts and minds... Kurt's blood is strong To me these past few weeks.. .you're the most beautiful queer I've ever seen in the wild... And once I get the elixir of life I can create a body for myself... now... why not this Will you give me this stone in your penalty?”

So he knew. Suddenly, he was back at Harry's feet. He stepped back.

"Don't be an idiot," the face said. "You better save your own life and join me… or you'll meet the same end as your parents… They died crying out for my mercy…."

"Liar!" Harry yelled in surprise.

Quirrell was walking behind him so that Voldemort could see him. The evil eye was now smiling.

"How touching… " He groaned. "I always value bravery... Yes sir, your parents were brave... I killed your father first; and he fought a brave fight... But your mother wasn't going to die... She was Will keep you safe... Now, give me the stone, unless you want it to die for free."

"never!"

Harry jumped towards the fireplace, but Voldemort shouted "SEIZE HIM!" And for the next second, Harry brought Quirrell's hand to his wrist. Suddenly, Harry was wounded by a sharp pain, and his skull felt like it was going to split in two; He screamed and fought with all his might, and suddenly Quirrell let go. The pain in his head had lessened – he looked around the forest to see where Quirrell had gone, and he saw him in pain, checking his fingers – they were swelling before his eyes.

"Hold it! Hold it!" Voldemort roared again, and Quirrell jumped, kicking Harry off his feet and knocking him to his knees, both hands pressed to Harry's throat -- Harry's blood was turning black with pain, yet he wou sees Quirrell screaming in pain.

"Merry, I can't hold it -- my arms -- my arms!"

And Quirrell, even as he held Harry down with his claws, released his stomach and looked down at him, soaked in his own hands -- Harry could see that they were burned, half, red, and glistening.

"Then kill him like he did!" Voldemort yelled.

Quirrell raised his hand for a killing curse, but Harry reached back and grabbed Quirrell's face --

"Aaargh!"

Quirrell rolled over, and his face was swollen, and then Harry knew: Quirrell could barely touch his skin without causing excruciating pain -- his only chance was to hold onto Quirrell and keep him from hurting enough to make him stop. Stop cursing.

Harry jumped to his feet, grabbing the queer in his arms and clinging to her as best he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry away -- Harry's headache was getting worse -- he couldn't see -- he could only hear Quirrell's terrible screams and Voldemort's screams, "KILL HIM! KILL HIM !" And other voices, possibly inside Harry's own head, screaming, "HARRY! HARRY!"

He felt Quirrell's hand severed from his hand, realized he was missing, and fell into the darkness, down... down... down...

Something gold glittered above it. Snitch! She tried to grab him, but his hands were too heavy.

She frowned. That’s not Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How beautiful.

She winked again. Albus Dumbledore's smirking face came up.

"Good afternoon, Harry," Dumbledore said.

Harry looked at him. Then he thought, "The king! The stone! It was the cross! He has the stone! Haste, king--"

"Calm down, big boy, you're a little behind schedule," Dab said. "Queers don't have judgment."

"So who does it? Really, I--"

"Please Harry, or Madam Pomfrey will throw me out."

Harry woke up and looked around. She realized she needed to be at the hospital. She was lying on a bed with white linen and next to her was a table that looked like half a candy store.

"Signs from your friends and fans," Dumbledore said, beaming. "What happened in the dungeon between you and Professor Queer is a complete secret, so it's a good thing the entire school knows. I believe it was your friends Miss Fred and George Weasley who sent you a report. No doubt Despite what they might have thought, Madam Pomfrey thought it wasn't very pure, she thought. hug."

"How long am I here?"

"Three suns. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger are relieved that you've arrived. They are very concerned."

"But man, the stone--"

"I see you didn't need to be interfered with. It's too good to be true, stone. Professor Queer couldn't take it away from you. I arrived in time to prevent it, though you were doing the right thing by yourself, I have to say. "

"You got there? Did you find Hermione's ghost?"

"We must go through the air. As soon as I got to London, it became clear to me that I was supposed to be where I left off. I arrived just in time to get the queer out of you."

"It was you."

"I was afraid I might be too late."

“You almost did, and I couldn’t have kept it in stone for so long—.”

"Not a stone, man, you -- the shell that was fired almost killed you. During one of the worst moments back there, I was afraid of it. Thankfully, it perished."

"Ruined?" Harry said bluntly. "But your friend -- Nicholas Flamel --."

"Oh, you know about Nicholas?" Dumbledore said excitedly. "Did you handle this alright? Yes, Nicole and I talked for a bit and we agreed that everything was fine."

"But that means he and his wife are going to die, right?"

"They have plenty of elixir to prepare, and yes, they will die."

Dumbledore smiled at the surprised look on Harry's face.

"For someone as young as me, I'm sure it seems like a big deal, but with Nicholas and Pernell, it's like going to bed after a long day. After all, the only memory I have is death, but the next great adventure, you know, stone wasn't really a good thing, you have two choices above all else - the problem is that humans tend to choose things that are worse for them."

Harry was there, talking sometimes. Dumbledore smiled slightly and smiled at the ceiling.

"Sir?" Harry said. "I was thinking... man -- even if the stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, you-know-who--"

"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the real name for things. The fear of the name increases the fear of the thing itself."

"Yes, Princess. Well, Voldemort is going to try other ways, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't been, has he?"

"No, Harry, he didn't. He's out there somewhere, probably looking for another body. He's alive and can't be killed. He let the Quirk die, and he shows no mercy to his of followers as enemies However, Harry, while you only drove him to strength, will take on someone else who is ready to fight. Which feels like a losing battle once more -- and if it's sometimes strengthened and sometimes strengthened why it can never return to power."

Harry shook his head, but stopped quickly because it hurt his head. Then he said, "Master, there are other things I would like to know if you could tell me... some things I would like to know the truth about..."

"True." Dumbledore sighed. "It's a good thing and a very serious thing, so it should be taken seriously. But I'm only answering your questions unless I have a good reason, so please forgive me. I won't forgive you. Of course, it's a lie."

"Well… Voldemort says he only killed my mother because he tried to prevent her from killing me. But why did he want to kill me in the first place?"

Dumbledore took a deep breath this time.

"Well, the first thing you ask me, I can't tell you. Not today. Not now. You know, someday... Get it out of your mind now, Harry. When you get older... I You know I don't want to hear that... When you're ready, you'll know."

Harry knew it was useless to argue.

"But why couldn't Kurt touch me?"

"Your mother died to save you. If there's one thing Voldemort can't understand, it's love. He didn't understand that the love your mother has for you carries its own weight. No blood, no visible signs … To love deeply, even when the one who loved you is gone, will always give us some protection, lies in your body Quirrell, full of hatred and hatred. "Ambitious and ambitious, sharing his soul with Voldemort, he couldn't touch you for this reason, it was painful to touch someone marked with something good."

Presently Dumbledore was interested in a bird in the window, which gave Harry time to stare at the leaf. Finding his voice, Harry said, "And the Invisibility Cloak - do you know who sent it to me?"

"Ah -- your father gave it to me, and I thought you might like it." Dumbledore's eyes widened. "Basic things… your father made it a point to sneak into the kitchen and steal food when he was here."

"And there's something else…."

"Fire out."

"Kierrell told Snape--"

"Professor Snape, Harry."

"Yeah, he -- Queer says he hates me because he hates my father. Is that true?"

"Well, they hated each other. You yourself and Mr. Melfie are not friends. Then again, your father did something Snape could never forgive."

"what?"

"He saved her life."

"what ?"

"Yes… " Dumbledore said dreamily. "It's funny how people's minds work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't have predicted your father's debt... I'm sure he's worked hard at protecting you this year because he thought it would bring him and Father do , at least so you can go back to your father's memory in peace..."

Harry tried to ignore this, but it patted his head, so he stopped.

"And there's one more thing, Prince..."

"Same one?"

"How did I get the stone out of the mirror?"

"Well, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It's one of my best memories, and between me and you, that's saying something. You see, only one person wanted to have the stone -- he Sure, but don't worry about it -- I can get it, otherwise they'll find themselves making gold or drinking the Bread of Life My brain sometimes surprises me... Now, more questions I "Tells you to start with these sweet ones. I hated them as a kid. I was afraid I'd get a little too hot for them -- but I guess I'll be safe with some good toffee?"

She smiled and popped the golden bean in her mouth. Then he shook his head and said, “No!

Madame Pomer, the nurse, was a kind woman, but she was very strict.

"Just five minutes," Harry demanded.

"Of course not."

"Let Professor Dumbledore in..."

"Well, actually, it was the headmaster. It's different. You need a break."

"I'm all right, look, I'm sure and everything. Oh, go away, Madame Pompey . . ."

"Oh, okay," she said. "But only five minutes."

and led Ron and Hermione inside.

"Harry!"

Hermione looked at him and threw her arms around him again, but Harry was glad he held back because his head hurt so much.

"Oh, Harry, we were sure you'd leave -- Dumbledore was so worried--"

"The whole school is talking about him," Ronnie said. "What really happened?"

It was one of those days, when the real story was louder and more inspiring than the wild tales. Harry told them everything: Quinn; mirror, stone; And Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were excellent listeners, sniffing in all the right places as Harry told them what was under Quirrell's hat and Hermione shrieked aloud.

"So the stone is gone?" Ron finally said. "Flammel is just about to die?"

"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thought -- what was it? -- 'To a prepared mind, death is the next big thing.'"

"I always said he was on his rocker," Ron said, almost forgetting how weak his former boss was.

"So what happened to you two?" Harry said.

"Well, I managed fine," Hermo said. "I picked up Ron -- it took a while -- and we were running to Gil's to meet Dumbledore when we saw him at the entrance -- he knew -- he was just saying 'Take Harry after him, won't you?' And he ran to the third floor."

"Do you think he wanted you to do it?" Ron said. "Sending you your father's clothes and everything?"

"Well," Hermione broke down, "if he did -- I mean seriously -- you could have been killed."

"No, it's not," Harry said thoughtfully. "He's a funny guy, Dumbledore. I think he wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows everything that's going on here, you know. I think he had the best idea, we were going to watched and before he stopped us he trained us to help, I don't think it was an accident, he let me know how hard he thought I had Joe. Face Voldemort if I may..."

"Yeah, Dumbledore is off his rocker, all right," Ron said proudly. "Listen, you have to be up for the senior year party tomorrow. All points scored, Slytherin won, sure -- you lost the last quidditch match, we got beaten by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food is It's good."

Meanwhile, Madame Pompeo pouted.

"You've got about fifteen minutes now OUT," he said firmly.

After a good night's sleep, Harry was back to normal.

“I want to go to the party,” she told Ms. Ponfrey as she straightened her many boxes of ceramics. "Can I, can't I?"

"Professor Dumbledore says you need to go," he said sternly, as if he thought Professor Dumbledore didn't realize that magic could be dangerous. "And you have another friend."

"Oh, okay," Harry said. "Who is it?"

Hagrid approached the door as he spoke. As usual, when he was inside the room, Hagrid seemed almost unbelievably large. She sat down next to Harry and took one look at him and burst into tears.

"It's -- all -- my -- red -- fault!" She cried and put her face in her hands, I said how the devil gets past Fiffy! I told him! That’s what he didn’t know, and I told him! Ye could die! It’s all part of the dragon! I won’t drink anymore! I should be banished and live like a Muggle!

"Hagrid!" Harry said, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with anger and remorse, a large tear running down his chin. "Hagrid, somehow he'd know, we're talking about Voldemort, he'd know without you telling him."

"Yeah, he could have died!" Hagrid shouted. "And don't say his name!"

"Voldemort!" Harry yelled and Hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying. "I found it and I call it by its name. Rest assured, Hagrid, we saved the stone. It's gone, it can't be used. I have a chocolate butterfly… "

Hagrid rubbed his nose with the back of his hand, "That reminds me. You got a present."

"It's not a sandwich, is it?" Harry said worriedly and Hagrid finally let out a weak laugh.

"No. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday to fix it. He should, he should've fired me instead -- anyway, you got this…."

It looked like a beautiful leather covered book. Harry opened his mouth curiously. It was full of pictures. His mother and father were smiling and winking at him from every corner of the page.

"You sent the owl around to all your parents' school friends asking for pictures... You know you don't have anything... Like that?"

Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.

Harry made his way to the New Year's Eve celebration alone that night. He was caught off guard by Madam Pomfrey's shouting and insistence that he give her one last check-up, so the hall was already packed. Decked out in Slytherin’s green and silver colors, Slytherin celebrated winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row. A large banner depicting a snake covered the wall behind the top table.

When Harry entered, there was a sudden silence, and then everyone immediately started talking. He slid into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Griffiths table and tried to get people to stop watching.

Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived a short time later. Grandpa died.

"Another year is up!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. "And I must torture you with the vocals of an old man who wakes up before we cut our teeth on our delicious feast. It's a wonderful year! I hope your heads are fuller than they were before… you have all the summer to Go enjoy them and empty them before the start of next year…

"Now, as I understand it, the Horse Cup here needs earnings, and the points stand as follows: in four places, Griffiths, three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, a hundred points. Three hundred and thirty-two, Ravenc have four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and four. Thirty-two."

A storm of music and blows broke out at the Slytherin table. Harry saw Draco Malfoy banging his cup on the table. It was a sickening sight.

"Yeah, yeah, good job, Slytherin," Dumbledore said. "However, recent events must be taken into account."

The room was very quiet. The Slytherins' smiles diminished slightly.

"Ah," Dumbledore said. "I have a few last-minute points I need to make. Let me see it. Yes…."

"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley…."

Ron went a little red in the face, it looked like a burnt rose.

"... For the best show Hogwarts has been for me for so many years, I'm giving thirty Gryffindor House points."

The Gryffindor music nearly lifted the magic of the ceiling, and the stars seemed to tremble. Percy could be heard saying to the other prefects, "My brother, you know! One of my brothers! I passed McGougall's biggest chess!"

Finally, there was silence again.

"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger… she made the right promise in front of the fire, I'll give Gryffindor House for thirty pounds."

Hermione buried her face in her hands; Harry doubted he had cried. The Gryffindors on the table and on the floor were right next to them -- they were hundreds of yards away.

"Three -- to Mr. Harry Potter…" Dumbledore said. The town was quiet. "... For pure nerve and good courage, I gave Gryffindor House sixty points."

The sound was deafening. Those who might have added themselves to screaming knew that Griffith was now one hundred and fifty-two days old -- the same as Slytherin. They were competing in the House Cup -- with Dumbledore only giving Harris a single point.

Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.

"There's all kinds of bravery," Dumbledore said, smiling. "It takes a lot of courage to stand up to our enemies, but equally as good to stand up to our friends. So I give Mr. Neville Longbottom ten points."

Someone standing outside the Great Place thought there had been some sort of explosion, and there was a loud noise coming from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron and Hermione stood up screaming and cheering as Neville white with devotion and he disappeared under the crowd hugging him. He had never been within one point of Gryffindor before. Harry, who was grateful, nudged Ron across the body and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more attractive if he'd put a body-binding curse on him.

"That means," Dumbledore called out to the crowd even as Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were enjoying the Slytherin grass, "we need a change of clothes."

She spread her hands. For a moment the red clouds became crimson and silver became gold; The three Slytherins disappeared and a Gryffindor lion took their place. Snape was holding Professor McGonagall's hand with a forced evil grin. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew now that Snape's feelings hadn't changed towards him at all. This didn't worry Harry. Looks like life will go back to normal next year, or at least like it used to at Hogwarts.

It had been the best night of Harry's life, better than winning quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain machinery… he would never forget this night.

Harry had almost forgotten that the test results were supposed to come, but they did. To their surprise, both he and Ron passed with perfect scores, while Hermione had the best scores of the first years. Although Neville nailed him, his excellent botany made up for his poor medication. They had hoped that Goil, who was as stupid as he was hostile, would get kicked out, but he too passed. That’s a shame, but like Ron said, you can’t have everything in life.

And suddenly, their uniforms were empty, their lockers overflowing, Neville’s ball was found and taken to a toilet, and leaflets had been circulated to all the students warning them not to celebrate during the holidays (“” I always hope they forget to give us this" said Fred Weasley cheerfully); Hagrid was there to disembark them from the ferries crossing the lake, they were at the Hogwarts Express; Talk and laugh as the village falls and forms; Eating all of Betty Bott’s beans as they sped through the Muggle cities, they took off their witch’s clothes and made their way to platform nine by three at King’s Cross Station.

It took a long time for them all to appear on the platform. An old guard used to put them at the door in pairs and threes, so as not to attract attention to the now solid wall and scare people away.

"You must come stay this summer," Ron said, "both of you -- I'll send you an owl."

"Thank you," Harry said, "I need something to do." The people complained as they continued to move forward towards the edge of the Muggle world. Some of these were called:

"We're going, Harry!"

"See you Potter!"

"Still popular," Ron said with a grin.

"Where I'm going, I promise you," Harry said.

Ron and Hermione walked through the door together. "Over there, Mom, over there, look!"

It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.

"Harry Potter!" she screamed. "Look, Mom! I can see--"

"Shut up, Ginny, it's rude to make a show."

Mrs. Weasel smiled at them.

"Is the year done?" she said.

"A lot," Harry said. "Thank you for the drill and the cloth, Mrs. Weasley."

"Oh, it's nothing, Mom."

"Are you guys ready?"

It was Uncle Vernon, red-faced and sweaty, staring at Harry's veins in agony as he carried a gung out of a cage at a station full of commoners. Behind him stood Petunia and Dudley, horrified at the sight of Harry.

"You must be Harry's family!" said Mrs. Weasel.

"In a word," said my friend Vernon. "Hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day." And he walked.

Harry leaned in for one last word with Ron and Hermione.

"So we'll see each other during the summer."

"I hope you have a good holiday," Hermione said, looking after Uncle Vernon, desperate that anyone could be so mean.

"Oh I do," Harry said, and they were surprised by the smile that continued to spread across his face. "They don't know that we're not supposed to practice at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Duddy this summer...
