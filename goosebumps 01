“There’s nothing to do in Pitts Landing,” Michael Warner said, his hands shoved 
into the pockets of his faded denim cutoffs. 

“Yeah. Pitts Landing is the pits,” Greg Banks said. 

Doug Arthur and Shari Walker muttered their agreement. 

Pitts Landing Is The Pits. That was the town slogan, according to Greg and 
his three friends. Actually, Pitts Landing wasn’t much different from a lot of 
small towns with quiet streets of shady lawns and comfortable old houses. 

But here it was, a balmy fall afternoon, and the four friends were hanging 
around Greg’s driveway, kicking at the gravel, wondering what to do for fun and 
excitement. 

“Let’s go to Grover’s and see if the new comic books have come in,” Doug 
suggested. 

“We don’t have any money, Bird,” Greg told him. 

Everyone called Doug “Bird”, because he looked a lot like a bird. A better 
nickname might have been “Stork”. He had long, skinny legs and took long, 
storklike steps. Under his thick tuft of brown hair, which he seldom brushed, he 
had small, birdlike brown eyes and a long nose that curved like a beak. Doug 
didn’t really like being called Bird, but he was used to it. 

“We can still look at the comics,” Bird insisted. 

“Until Grover starts yelling at you,” Shari said. She puffed out her cheeks 
and did a pretty good imitation of the gruff store owner: “Are you paying or 
staying?” 

“He thinks he’s cool,” Greg said, laughing at her imitation. “He’s such a 
jerk.” 

“I think the new X-Force is coming in this week,” Bird said. 

“You should join the X-Force,” Greg said, giving his pal a playful shove. 
“You could be Bird Man. You’d be great!” 

“We should all join the X-Force,” Michael said. “If we were superheroes, 
maybe we’d have something to do.” 

“No, we wouldn’t,” Shari quickly replied. “There’s no crime to fight in Pitts 
Landing.” 

“We could fight crabgrass,” Bird suggested. He was the joker in the group. 



The others laughed. The four of them had been friends for a long time. Greg 
and Shari lived next door to each other, and their parents were best friends. Bird 
and Michael lived on the next block. 

“How about a baseball game?” Michael suggested. “We could go down to 
the playground.” 

“No way,” Shari said. “You can’t play with only four people.” She pushed 
back a strand of her crimped black hair that had fallen over her face. She was 
wearing an oversized yellow sweatshirt over bright green leggings. 

“Maybe we’ll find some other kids there,” Michael said, picking up a 
handful of gravel from the drive and letting it sift through his chubby fingers. 
Michael had short red hair, blue eyes, and a face full of freckles. He wasn’t 
exactly fat, but no one would ever call him skinny. 

“Come on, let’s play baseball,” Bird urged. “I need the practice. My Little 
League starts in a couple of days.” 

“Little League? In the fall?” Shari asked. 

“It’s a new fall league. The first game is Tuesday after school,” Bird 
explained. 

“Hey—we’ll come watch you,” Greg said. 

“We’ll come watch you strike out,” Shari added. Her hobby was teasing 

Bird. 

“What position are you playing?” Greg asked. 

“Backstop,” Michael cracked. 

No one laughed. Michael’s jokes always fell flat. 

Bird shrugged. “Probably the outfield. How come you’re not playing, 
Greg?” 

With his big shoulders and muscular arms and legs, Greg was the natural 
athlete of the group. He was blond and good-looking, with flashing gray-green 
eyes and a wide, friendly smile. 

“My brother, Terry, was supposed to go sign me up, but he forgot,” Greg 
said, making a disgusted face. 

“Where is Terry?” Shari asked. She had a tiny crush on Greg’s older 
brother. 

“He got a job Saturdays and after school. At the Dairy Freeze,” Greg told 
her. 

“Let’s go to the Dairy Freeze!” Michael exclaimed enthusiastically. 

“We don’t have any money—remember?” Bird said glumly. 



“Terry’ll give us free cones,” Michael said, turning a hopeful gaze on Greg. 

“Yeah. Free cones. But no ice cream in them,” Greg told him. “You know 
what a straight arrow my brother is.” 

“This is boring,” Shari complained, watching a robin hop across the 
sidewalk. “It’s boring standing around talking about how bored we are.” 

“We could sit down and talk about how bored we are,” Bird suggested, 
twisting his mouth into the goofy half smile he always wore when he was 
making a dumb joke. 

“Let’s take a walk or a jog or something,” Shari insisted. She made her way 
across the lawn and began walking, balancing her white high-tops on the edge of 
the curb, waving her arms like a high-wire performer. 

The boys followed, imitating her in an impromptu game of follow the 
leader, all of them balancing on the curb edge as they walked. 

A curious cocker spaniel came bursting out of the neighbors’ hedge, 
yapping excitedly. Shari stopped to pet him. The dog, its stub of a tail wagging 
furiously, licked her hand a few times. Then the dog lost interest and disappeared 
back into the hedge. 

The four friends continued down the block, playfully trying to knock each 
other off the curb as they walked. They crossed the street and continued on past 
the school. A couple of guys were shooting baskets, and some little kids played 
kick ball on the practice baseball diamond, but no one they knew. 

The road curved away from the school. They followed it past familiar 
houses. Then, just beyond a small wooded area, they stopped and looked up a 
sloping lawn, the grass uncut for weeks, tall weeds poking out everywhere, the 
shrubs ragged and overgrown. 

At the top of the lawn, nearly hidden in the shadows of enormous old oak 
trees, sprawled a large ramshackle house. The house, anyone could see, had once 
been grand. It was gray shingled, three stories tall, with a wraparound screened 
porch, a sloping red roof, and tall chimneys on either end. But the broken 
windows on the second floor, the cracked, weather-stained shingles, the bare 
spots on the roof, and the shutters hanging loosely beside the dust-smeared 
windows were evidence of the house’s neglect. 

Everyone in Pitts Landing knew it as the Coffman house. Coffman was the 
name painted on the mailbox that tilted on its broken pole over the front walk. 

But the house had been deserted for years—ever since Greg and his friends 
could remember. 



And people liked to tell weird stories about the house: ghost stories and 
wild tales about murders and ghastly things that happened there. Most likely, 
none of them were true. 

“Hey—I know what we can do for excitement,” Michael said, staring up at 
the house bathed in shadows. 

“Huh? What are you talking about?” Greg asked warily. 

“Let’s go into the Coffman house,” Michael said, starting to make his way 
across the weed-choked lawn. 

“Whoa. Are you crazy?” Greg called, hurrying to catch up to him. 

“Let’s go in,” Michael said, his blue eyes catching the light of the late 
afternoon sun filtering down through the tall oak trees. “We wanted an 
adventure. Something a little exciting, right? Come on—let’s check it out.” 

Greg hesitated and stared up at the house. A cold chill ran down his back. 

Before he could reply, a dark form leaped up from the shadows of the tall 
weeds and attacked him!

Greg toppled backward onto the ground. “Aah!” he screamed. Then he realized 
the others were laughing. 

“It’s that dumb cocker spaniel!” Shari cried. “He followed us!” 

“Go home, dog. Go home!” Bird shooed the dog away. 

The dog trotted to the curb, turned around, and stared back at them, its 
stubby tail wagging furiously. 

Feeling embarrassed that he’d become so frightened, Greg slowly pulled 
himself to his feet, expecting his friends to give him grief. But they were staring 
up at the Coffman house thoughtfully. 

“Yeah, Michael’s right,” Bird said, slapping Michael hard on the back, so 
hard Michael winced and turned to slug Bird. “Let’s see what it’s like in there.” 

“No way,” Greg said, hanging back. “I mean, the place is kind of creepy, 
don’t you think?” 

“So?” Shari challenged him, joining Michael and Bird, who repeated her 
question: “So?” 

“So... I don’t know,” Greg replied. He didn’t like being the sensible one of 
the group. Everyone always made fun of the sensible one. He’d rather be the 
wild and crazy one. But somehow he always ended up sensible. 

“I don’t think we should go in there,” he said, staring up at the neglected 
old house. 

“Are you chicken?” Bird asked. 

“Chicken!” Michael joined in. 

Bird began to cluck loudly, tucking his hands into his armpits and flapping 
his arms. With his beady eyes and beaky nose, he looked just like a chicken. 

Greg didn’t want to laugh, but he couldn’t help it. 

Bird always made him laugh. 

The clucking and flapping seemed to end the discussion. They were 
standing at the foot of the broken concrete steps that led up to the screened 
porch. 

“Look. The window next to the front door is broken,” Shari said. “We can 
just reach in and open the door.” 

“This is cool,” Michael said enthusiastically. 



“Are we really doing this?” Greg, being the sensible one, had to ask. “I 
mean—what about Spidey?” 

Spidey was a weird-looking man of fifty or sixty they’d all seen lurking 
about town. He dressed entirely in black and crept along on long, slender legs. 
He looked just like a black spider, so the kids all called him Spidey. 

Most likely he was homeless or a drifter. No one really knew anything 
about him—where he’d come from, where he lived. But a lot of kids had seen 
him hanging around the Coffman house. 

“Maybe Spidey doesn’t like visitors,” Greg warned. 

But Shari was already reaching in through the broken windowpane to 
unlock the front door. And after little effort, she turned the brass knob and the 
heavy wooden door swung open. 

One by one, they stepped into the front entryway, Greg reluctantly bringing 
up the rear. It was dark inside the house. Only narrow beams of sunlight 
managed to trickle down through the heavy trees in front, creating pale circles of 
light on the worn brown carpet at their feet. 

The floorboards squeaked as Greg and his friends made their way past the 
living room, which was bare except for a couple of overturned grocery store 
cartons against one wall. 

Spidey’s furniture? Greg wondered. 

The living room carpet, as threadbare as the one in the entryway, had a dark 
oval stain in the center of it. Greg and Bird, stopping in the doorway, both 
noticed it at the same time. 

“Think it’s blood?” Bird asked, his tiny eyes lighting up with excitement. 

Greg felt a chill on the back of his neck. “Probably ketchup,” he replied. 
Bird laughed and slapped him hard on the back. 

Shari and Michael were exploring the kitchen. They were staring at the 
dust-covered counter as Greg and Bird stepped up behind them. They saw 
immediately what had captured their attention. Two fat gray mice were standing 
on the counter, staring back at Shari and Michael. 

“They’re cute,” Shari said. “They look just like cartoon mice.” 

The sound of her voice made the two rodents scamper along the counter, 
around the sink, and out of sight. 

“They’re gross,” Michael said, making a disgusted face. “I think they were 
rats—not mice.” 

“Rats have long tails. Mice don’t,” Greg told him. 



“They were definitely rats,” Bird muttered, pushing past them and into the 
hallway. He disappeared toward the front of the house. 

Shari reached up and pulled open a cabinet over the counter. Empty. “I 
guess Spidey never uses the kitchen,” she said. 

“Well, I didn’t think he was a gourmet chef,” Greg joked. 

He followed her into the long, narrow dining room, as bare and dusty as the 
other rooms. A low chandelier still hung from the ceiling, so brown with caked 
dust it was impossible to tell that it was glass. 

“Looks like a haunted house,” Greg said softly. 

“Boo, ” Shari replied. 

“There’s not much to see in here,” Greg complained, following her back to 
the dark hallway. “Unless you get a thrill from dustballs.” 

Suddenly, a loud crack made him jump. 

Shari laughed and squeezed his shoulder. 

“What was that?” he cried, unable to stifle his fear. 

“Old houses do things like that,” she said. “They make noises for no reason 
at all.” 

“I think we should leave,” Greg insisted, embarrassed again that he’d acted 
so frightened. “I mean, it’s boring in here.” 

“It’s kind of exciting being somewhere we’re not supposed to be,” Shari 
said, peeking into a dark, empty room—probably a den or study at one time. 

“I guess,” Greg replied uncertainly. 

They bumped into Michael. “Where’s Bird?” Greg asked. 

“I think he went down to the basement,” Michael replied. 

“Huh? The basement?” 

Michael pointed to an open door at the right of the hallway. “The stairs are 
there.” 

The three of them made their way to the top of the stairs. They peered down 
into the darkness. “Bird?” 

From somewhere deep in the basement, his voice floated up to them in a 
horrified scream: “Help! It’s got me! Somebody—please help! It’s got me!” 



3 


“It’s got me! It’s got me!” 

At the sound of Bird’s terrified cries, Greg pushed past Shari and Michael, 
who stood frozen in openmouthed horror. Practically flying down the steep 
stairway, Greg called out to his friend. “I’m coming, Bird! What is it?” 

His heart pounding, Greg stopped at the bottom of the stairs, every muscle 
tight with fear. His eyes searched frantically through the smoky light pouring in 
from the basement windows up near the ceiling. 

“Bird?” 

There he was, sitting comfortably, calmly, on an overturned metal trash can, 
his legs crossed, a broad smile on his birdlike face. “Gotcha,” he said softly, and 
burst out laughing. 

“What is it? What happened ?” came the frightened voices of Shari and 
Michael. They clamored down the stairs, coming to a stop beside Greg. 

It took them only a few seconds to scope out the situation. 

“Another dumb joke?” Michael asked, his voice still trembling with fear. 

“Bird—were you goofing on us again?” Shari asked, shaking her head. 

Enjoying his moment, Bird nodded, with his peculiar half grin. “You guys 
are too easy,” he scoffed. 

“But, Doug—” Shari started. She only called him Doug when she was upset 
with him. “Haven’t you ever heard of the boy who cried wolf? What if 
something bad happens sometime, and you really need help, and we think you’re 
just goofing?” 

“What could happen?” Bird replied smugly. He stood up and gestured 
around the basement. “Look—it’s brighter down here than upstairs.” 

He was right. Sunlight from the backyard cascaded down through four long 
windows at ground level, near the ceiling of the basement. 

“I still think we should get out of here,” Greg insisted, his eyes moving 
quickly around the large, cluttered room. 

Behind Bird’s overturned trash can stood an improvised table made out of a 
sheet of plywood resting on four paint cans. A nearly flat mattress, dirty and 
stained, rested against the wall, a faded wool blanket folded at the foot. 

“Spidey must live down here!” Michael exclaimed. 



Bird kicked his way through a pile of empty food boxes that had been 
tossed all over the floor—TV dinners, mostly. “Hey, a Hungry Man dinner!” he 
exclaimed. “Where does Spidey heat these up?” 

“Maybe he eats them frozen,” Shari suggested. “You know. Like 
Popsicles.” 

She made her way toward a towering oak wardrobe and pulled open the 
doors. “Wow! This is excellent !” she declared. “Look!” She pulled out a ratty- 
looking fur coat and wrapped it around her shoulders. “Excellent!” she repeated, 
twirling in the old coat. 

From across the room, Greg could see that the wardrobe was stuffed with 
old clothing. Michael and Bird hurried to join Shari and began pulling out 
strange-looking pairs of bell-bottom pants, yellowed dress shirts with pleats 
down the front, tie-dyed neckties that were about a foot wide, and bright-colored 
scarves and bandannas. 

“Hey, guys—” Greg warned. “Don’t you think maybe those belong to 
somebody?” 

Bird spun around, a fuzzy red boa wrapped around his neck and shoulders. 
“Yeah. These are Spidey’s dress-up clothes,” he cracked. 

“Check out this baad hat,” Shari said, turning around to show off the bright 
purple wide-brimmed hat she had pulled on. 

“Neat,” Michael said, examining a long blue cape. “This stuff must be at 
least twenty-five years old. It’s awesome. How could someone just leave it 
here?” 

“Maybe they’re coming back for it,” Greg suggested. 

As his friends explored the contents of the wardrobe, Greg wandered to the 
other end of the large basement. A furnace occupied the far wall, its ducts 
covered in thick cobwebs. Partially hidden by the furnace ducts, Greg could see 
stairs, probably leading to an outside exit. 

Wooden shelves lined the adjoining wall, cluttered with old paint cans, rags, 
newspapers, and rusty tools. 

Whoever lived here must have been a real handyman, Greg thought, 
examining a wooden worktable in front of the shelves. A metal vise was clamped 
to the edge of the worktable. Greg turned the handle, expecting the jaws of the 
vise to open. 

But to his surprise, as he turned the vise handle, a door just above the 
worktable popped open. Greg pulled the door all the way open, revealing a 



hidden cabinet shelf. 

Resting on the shelf was a camera. 



4 


For a long moment, Greg just stared at the camera. 

Something told him the camera was hidden away for a reason. 

Something told him he shouldn’t touch it. He should close the secret door 
and walk away. 

But he couldn’t resist it. 

He reached onto the hidden shelf and took the camera in his hands. 

It pulled out easily. Then, to Greg’s surprise, the door instantly snapped 
shut with a loud bang. 

Weird, he thought, turning the camera in his hands. 

What a strange place to leave a camera. Why would someone put it here? If 
it were valuable enough to hide in a secret cabinet, why didn’t he take it with 
him? 

Greg eagerly examined the camera. It was large and surprisingly heavy, 
with a long lens. Perhaps it’s a telephoto lens, he thought. 

Greg was very interested in cameras. He had an inexpensive automatic 
camera, which took okay snapshots. But he was saving his allowance in hopes of 
buying a really good camera with a lot of lenses. 

He loved looking at camera magazines, studying the different models, 
picking out the ones he wanted to buy. 

Sometimes he daydreamed about traveling around the world, going to 
amazing places, mountaintops and hidden jungle rivers. He’d take photos of 
everything he saw and become a famous photographer. 

His camera at home was just too crummy. That’s why all his pictures came 
out too dark or too light, and everyone in them had glowing red dots in their 
eyes. 

Greg wondered if this camera was any good. 

Raising the viewfinder to his eye, he sighted around the room. He came to a 
stop on Michael, who was wearing two bright yellow feather boas and a white 
Stetson hat and had climbed to the top of the steps to pose. 

“Wait! Hold it!” Greg cried, moving closer, raising the camera to his eye. 
“Let me take your picture, Michael.” 

“Where’d you find that?” Bird asked. 



“Does that thing have film in it?” Michael demanded. 

“I don’t know,” Greg said. “Let’s see.” 

Leaning against the railing, Michael struck what he considered a 
sophisticated pose. 

Greg pointed the camera up and focused carefully. It took a short while for 
his finger to locate the shutter button. “Okay, ready? Say cheese.” 

“Cheddar,” Michael said, grinning down at Greg as he held his pose against 
the railing. 

“Very funny. Michael’s a riot,” Bird said sarcastically. 

Greg centered Michael in the viewfinder frame, then pressed the shutter 
button. 

The camera clicked and flashed. 

Then it made an electronic whirring sound. A slot pulled open on the 
bottom, and a cardboard square slid out. 

“Hey—it’s one of those automatic-developing cameras,” Greg exclaimed. 
He pulled the square of cardboard out and examined it. “Look—the picture is 
starting to develop.” 

“Let me see,” Michael called down, leaning on the railing. 

But before he could start down the stairs, everyone heard a loud crunching 
sound. 

They all looked up to the source of the sound—and saw the railing break 
away and Michael go sailing over the edge. 

“Noooooo!” Michael screamed as he toppled to the floor, arms outstretched, 
the feather boas flying behind him like animal tails. 

He turned in the air, then hit the concrete hard on his back, his eyes frozen 
wide in astonishment and fright. 

He bounced once. 

Then cried out again: “My ankle! Owwww/ My ankle!” He grabbed at the 
injured ankle, then quickly let go with a loud gasp. It hurt too much to touch it. 

“Ohhh —my ankle! ” 

Still holding the camera and the photo, Greg rushed to Michael. Shari and 
Bird did the same. 

“We’ll go get help,” Shari told Michael, who was still on his back, groaning 
in pain. 

But then they heard the ceiling creak. 

Footsteps. Above them. 



Someone was in the house. 

Someone was approaching the basement stairs. 
They were going to be caught. 



5 


The footsteps overhead grew louder. 

The four friends exchanged frightened glances. “We’ve got to get out of 
here,” Shari whispered. 

The ceiling creaked. 

“You can’t leave me here!” Michael protested. He pulled himself to a sitting 
position. 

“Quick—stand up,” Bird instructed. 

Michael struggled to his feet. “I can’t stand on this foot.” His face revealed 
his panic. 

“We’ll help you,” Shari said, turning her eyes to Bird. “I’ll take one arm. 
You take the other.” 

Bird obediently moved forward and pulled Michael’s arm around his 
shoulder. 

“Okay, let’s move!” Shari whispered, supporting Michael from the other 

side. 

“But how do we get out?” Bird asked breathlessly. 

The footsteps grew louder. The ceiling creaked under their weight. 

“We can’t go up the stairs,” Michael whispered, leaning on Shari and Bird. 
“There’s another stairway behind the furnace,” Greg told them, pointing. 

“It leads out?” Michael asked, wincing from his ankle pain. 

“Probably.” 

Greg led the way. “Just pray the door isn’t padlocked or something.” 

“We’re praying. We’re praying!” Bird declared. 

“We’re outta here!” Shari said, groaning under the weight of Michael’s arm. 
Leaning heavily against Shari and Bird, Michael hobbled after Greg, and 
they made their way to the stairs behind the furnace. The stairs, they saw, led to 
wooden double doors up on ground level. 

“I don’t see a padlock,” Greg said warily. “Please, doors—be open!” 

“Hey —who’s down there?” an angry man’s voice called from behind them. 
“It’s—it’s Spidey!” Michael stammered. 

“Hurry!” Shari urged, giving Greg a frightened push. “Come on!” 



Greg set the camera down on the top step. Then he reached up and grabbed 
the handles of the double doors. 

“Who’s down there?” 

Spidey sounded closer, angrier. 

“The doors could be locked from the outside,” Greg whispered, hesitating. 
“Just push them, man!” Bird pleaded. 

Greg took a deep breath and pushed with all his strength. 

The doors didn’t budge. 

“We’re trapped,” he told them. 



6 


“Now what?” Michael whined. 

“Try again,” Bird urged Greg. “Maybe they’re just stuck.” He slid out from 
under Michael’s arm. “Here. I’ll help you.” 

Greg moved over to give Bird room to step up beside him. “Ready?” he 
asked. “One, two, three— push !” 

Both boys pushed against the heavy wooden doors with all their might. 

And the doors swung open. 

“Okay! Now we’re outta here!” Shari declared happily. 

Picking up the camera, Greg led the way out. The backyard, he saw, was as 
weed-choked and overgrown as the front. An enormous limb had fallen off an 
old oak tree, probably during a storm, and was lying half in the tree, half on the 
ground. 

Somehow, Bird and Shari managed to drag Michael up the steps and onto 
the grass. “Can you walk? Try it,” Bird said. 

Still leaning against the two of them, Michael reluctantly pushed his foot 
down on the ground. He lifted it. Then pushed it again. “Hey, it feels a little 
better,” he said, surprised. 

“Then let’s go,” Bird said. 

They ran to the overgrown hedge that edged along the side of the yard, 
Michael on his own now, stepping gingerly on the bad ankle, doing his best to 
keep up. Then, staying in the shadow of the hedge, they made their way around 
the house to the front. 

“All right!” Bird cried happily as they reached the street. “We made it!” 

Gasping for breath, Greg stopped at the curb and turned back toward the 
house. “Look!” he cried, pointing up to the living room window. 

A dark figure stood in the window, hands pressed against the glass. 

“It’s Spidey,” Shari said. 

“He’s just—staring at us,” Michael cried. 

“Weird,” Greg said. “Let’s go.” 

They didn’t stop till they got to Michael’s house, a sprawling redwood ranch- 
style house behind a shady front lawn. 



“How’s the ankle?” Greg asked. 

“It’s loosened up a lot. It doesn’t even hurt that much,” Michael said. 

“Man, you could’ve been killed !” Bird declared, wiping sweat off his 
forehead with the sleeve of his T-shirt. 

“Thanks for reminding me,” Michael said drily. 

“Lucky thing you’ve got all that extra padding,” Bird teased. 

“Shut up,” Michael muttered. 

“Well, you guys wanted adventure,” Shari said, leaning back against the 
trunk of a tree. 

“That guy Spidey is definitely weird,” Bird said, shaking his head. 

“You see the way he was staring at us?” Michael asked. “All dressed in 
black and everything? He looked like some kind of zombie or something.” 

“He saw us,” Greg said softly, suddenly feeling a chill of dread. “He saw us 
very clearly. We’d better stay away from there.” 

“What for?” Michael demanded. “It isn’t his house. He’s just sleeping there. 
We could call the police on him.” 

“But if he’s really crazy or something, there’s no telling what he might do,” 
Greg replied thoughtfully. 

“Aw, he’s not going to do anything,” Shari said quietly. “Spidey doesn’t 
want trouble. He just wants to be left alone.” 

“Yeah,” Michael agreed quickly. “He didn’t want us messing with his stuff. 
That’s why he yelled like that and came after us.” 

Michael was leaning over, rubbing his ankle. “Hey, where’s my picture?” he 
demanded, straightening up and turning to Greg. 

“Huh?” 

“You know. The picture you snapped. With the camera.” 

“Oh. Right.” Greg suddenly realized he still had the camera gripped tightly 
in his hand. He set it down carefully on the grass and reached into his back 
pocket. “I put it in here when we started to run,” he explained. 

“Well? Did it come out?” Michael demanded. 

The three of them huddled around Greg to get a view of the snapshot. 

“Whoa—hold on a minute!” Greg cried, staring hard at the small, square 
photo. “Something’s wrong. What’s going on here?” 



7 


The four friends gaped at the photograph in Greg’s hand, their mouths dropping 
open in surprise. 

The camera had caught Michael in midair as he fell through the broken 
railing to the floor. 

“That’s impossible!” Shari cried. 

“You snapped the picture before I fell!” Michael declared, grabbing the 
photo out of Greg’s hand so that he could study it close up. “I remember it.” 

“You remembered wrong,” Bird said, moving to get another look at it over 
Michael’s shoulder. “You were falling, man. What a great action shot.” He 
picked up the camera. “This is a good camera you stole, Greg.” 

“I didn’t steal it—” Greg started. “I mean, I didn’t realize—” 

“I wasn’t falling!” Michael insisted, tilting the picture in his hand, studying 
it from every angle. “I was posing, remember? I had a big, goofy smile on my 
face, and I was posing.” 

“I remember the goofy smile,” Bird said, handing the camera back to Greg. 
“Do you have any other expression?” 

“You’re not funny, Bird,” Michael muttered. He pocketed the picture. 

“Weird,” Greg said. He glanced at his watch. “Hey—I’ve got to get going.” 

He said good-bye to the others and headed for home. The afternoon sun was 
lowering behind a cluster of palm trees, casting long, shifting shadows over the 
sidewalk. 

He had promised his mother he’d straighten up his room and help with the 
vacuuming before dinner. And now he was late. 

What is that strange car in the driveway? he wondered, jogging across the 
neighbor’s lawn toward his house. 

It was a navy-blue Taurus station wagon. Brand-new. 

Dad picked up our new car! he realized. 

Wow! Greg stopped to admire it. It still had the sticker glued to the door 
window. He pulled open the driver’s door, leaned in, and smelled the vinyl 
upholstery. 

Mmmmmm. That new-car smell. 

He inhaled deeply again. It smelled so good. So fresh and new. 



He closed the door hard, appreciating the solid clunk it made as it closed. 

What a great new car, he thought excitedly. 

He raised the camera to his eye and took a few steps back off the driveway. 

I’ve got to take a picture of this, he thought. To remember what the car was 
like when it was totally new. 

He backed up until he had framed the entire profile of the station wagon in 
the viewfinder. Then he pressed the shutter button. 

As before, the camera clicked loudly, the flash flashed, and with an 
electronic whirr, a square undeveloped photo of gray and yellow slid out of the 
bottom. 

Carrying the camera and the snapshot, Greg ran into the house through the 
front door. “I’m home!” he called. “Down in a minute!” And hurried up the 
carpeted stairs to his room. 

“Greg? Is that you? Your father is home,” his mother called from 
downstairs. 

“I know. Be right down. Sorry I’m late!” Greg shouted back. 

I’d better hide the camera, he decided. If Mom or Dad see it, they’ll want to 
know whose it is and where I got it. And I won’t be able to answer those 
questions. 

“Greg—did you see the new car? Are you coming down?” his mother 
called impatiently from the foot of the stairs. 

“I’m coming!” he yelled. 

His eyes searched frantically for a good hiding place. 

Under his bed? 

No. His mom might vacuum under there and discover it. 

Then Greg remembered the secret compartment in his headboard. He had 
discovered the compartment years ago when his parents had bought him a new 
bedroom set. Quickly, he shoved the camera in. 

Peering into the mirror above his dresser, he gave his blond hair a quick 
brush, rubbed a black soot smudge off his cheek with one hand, then started for 
the door. 

He stopped at the doorway. 

The snapshot of the car. Where had he put it? 

It took a few seconds to remember that he had tossed it onto his bed. 
Curious about how it came out, he turned back to retrieve it. 

“Oh, no!” 



He uttered a low cry as he gazed at the snapshot.

What’s going on here? Greg wondered. 

He brought the photo up close to his face. 

This isn’t right, he thought. How can this be? 

The blue Taurus station wagon in the photo was a mess. It looked as if it 
had been in a terrible accident. The windshield was shattered. Metal was twisted 
and bent. The door on the driver’s side was caved in. 

The car appeared totaled! 

“This is impossible!” Greg uttered aloud. 

“Greg, where are you?” his mother called. “We’re all hungry, and you’re 
keeping us waiting.” 

“Sorry,” he answered, unable to take his eyes off the snapshot. “Coming.” 

He shoved the photo into his top dresser drawer and made his way 
downstairs. The image of the totaled car burned in his mind. 

Just to make sure, he crossed the living room and peeked out of the front 
window to the driveway. 

There stood the station wagon, sparkling in the glow of the setting sun. 
Shiny and perfect. 

He turned and walked into the dining room, where his brother and his 
parents were already seated. “The new wagon is awesome, Dad,” Greg said, 
trying to shake the snapshot’s image from his thoughts. 

But he kept seeing the twisted metal, the caved-in driver’s door, the 
shattered windshield. 

“After dinner,” Greg’s dad announced happily, “I’m taking you all for a 
drive in the new car!”

“Mmmm. This is great chicken, Mom,” Greg’s brother, Terry, said, chewing as he 
talked. 

“Thanks for the compliment,” Mrs. Banks said drily, “but it’s veal—not 
chicken.” 

Greg and his dad burst out laughing. Terry’s face grew bright red. “Well,” 
he said, still chewing, “it’s such excellent veal, it tastes as good as chicken!” 

“I don’t know why I bother to cook,” Mrs. Banks sighed. 

Mr. Banks changed the subject. “How are things at the Dairy Freeze?” he 
asked. 

“We ran out of vanilla this afternoon,” Terry said, forking a small potato 
and shoving it whole into his mouth. He chewed it briefly, then gulped it down. 
“People were annoyed about that.” 

“I don’t think I can go for the ride,” Greg said, staring down at his dinner, 
which he’d hardly touched. “I mean—” 

“Why not?” his father asked. 

“Well...” Greg searched his mind for a good reason. He needed to make 
one up, but his mind was a blank. 

He couldn’t tell them the truth. 

That he had taken a snapshot of Michael, and it showed Michael falling. 
Then a few seconds later, Michael had fallen. 

And now he had taken a picture of the new car. And the car was wrecked in 
the photo. 

Greg didn’t really know what it meant. But he was suddenly filled with this 
powerful feeling of dread, of fear, of... he didn’t know what. 

A kind of troubled feeling he’d never had before. 

But he couldn’t tell them any of that. It was too weird. Too crazy. 

“I... made plans to go over to Michael’s,” he lied, staring down at his plate. 

“Well, call him and tell him you’ll see him tomorrow,” Mr. Banks said, 
slicing his veal. “That’s no problem.” 

“Well, I’m kind of not feeling very well, either,” Greg said. 

“What’s wrong?” Mrs. Banks asked with instant concern. “Do you have a 
temperature? I thought you looked a little flushed when you came in.” 



“No,” Greg replied uncomfortably. “No temperature. I just feel kind of 
tired, not very hungry.” 

“Can I have your chicken—I mean, veal?” 

Terry asked eagerly. He reached his fork across the table and nabbed the 
cutlet off Greg’s plate. 

“Well, a nice ride might make you feel better,” Greg’s dad said, eyeing 
Greg suspiciously. “You know, some fresh air. You can stretch out in the back if 
you want.” 

“But, Dad—” Greg stopped. He had used up all the excuses he could think 
of. They would never believe him if he said he needed to stay home and do 
homework on a Saturday night! 

“You’re coming with us, and that’s final,” Mr. Banks said, still studying 
Greg closely. “You’ve been dying for this new wagon to arrive. I really don’t 
understand your problem.” 

Neither do I, Greg admitted to himself. 

I don’t understand it at all. Why am I so afraid of riding in the new car? 
Just because there’s something wrong with that stupid camera? 

I’m being silly, Greg thought, trying to shake away the feeling of dread that 
had taken away his appetite. 

“Okay, Dad. Great,” he said, forcing a smile. “I’ll come.” 

“Are there any more potatoes?” Terry asked.

“It’s so easy to drive,” Mr. Banks said, accelerating onto the entry ramp to the 
freeway. “It handles like a small car, not like a station wagon.” 

“Plenty of room back here, Dad,” Terry said, scooting low in the backseat 
beside Greg, raising his knees to the back of the front seat. 

“Hey, look—there’s a drink holder that pulls out from the dash!” Greg’s 
mother exclaimed. “That’s neat.” 

“Awesome, Mom,” Terry said sarcastically. 

“Well, we never had a drink holder before,” Mrs. Banks replied. She turned 
back to the two boys. “Are your seat belts buckled? Do they work properly?” 

“Yeah. They’re okay,” Terry replied. 

“They checked them at the showroom before I took the car,” Mr. Banks 
said, signaling to move into the left lane. 

A truck roared by, spitting a cloud of exhaust behind it. Greg stared out the 
front window. His door window was still covered by the new-car sticker. 

Mr. Banks pulled off the freeway onto a nearly empty four-lane highway 
that curved toward the west. The setting sun was a red ball low on the horizon in 
a charcoal-gray sky. 

“Put the pedal to the metal, Dad,” Terry urged, sitting up and leaning 
forward. “Let’s see what this car can do.” 

Mr. Banks obediently pressed his foot on the accelerator. “The cruising 
speed seems to be about sixty,” he said. 

“Slow down,” Mrs. Banks scolded. “You know the speed limit is fifty-five.” 

“I’m just testing it,” Greg’s dad said defensively. “You know. Making sure 
the transmission doesn’t slip or anything.” 

Greg stared at the glowing speedometer. They were doing seventy now. 

“Slow down. I mean it,” Mrs. Banks insisted. “You’re acting like a crazy 
teenager.” 

“That’s me!” Mr. Banks replied, laughing. “This is awesome !” he said, 
imitating Terry, ignoring his wife’s pleas to slow down. 

They roared past a couple of small cars in the right lane. Headlights of cars 
moving toward them were a bright white blur in the darkening evening. 

“Hey, Greg, you’ve been awfully quiet,” his mother said. “You feeling 



okay?” 

“Yeah. I’m okay,” Greg said softly. 

He wished his dad would slow down. He was doing seventy-five now. 

“What do you think, Greg?” Mr. Banks asked, steering with his left hand as 
his right hand searched the dashboard. “Where’s the light switch? I should turn 
on my headlights.” 

“The car’s great,” Greg replied, trying to sound enthusiastic. But he 
couldn’t shake away the fear, couldn’t get the photo of the mangled car out of his 
mind. 

“Where’s that stupid light switch? It’s got to be here somewhere,” Mr. 
Banks said. 

As he glanced down at the unfamiliar dashboard, the station wagon swerved 
to the left. 

“Dad—look out for that truck! ” Greg screamed. 



11 


Horns blared. 

A powerful blast of air swept over the station wagon, like a giant ocean 
wave pushing it to the side. 

Mr. Banks swerved the station wagon to the right. 

The truck rumbled past. 

“Sorry,” Greg’s dad said, eyes straight ahead, slowing the car to sixty, fifty- 
five, fifty... 

“I told you to slow down,” Mrs. Banks scolded, shaking her head. “We 
could’ve been killed!” 

“I was trying to find the lights,” he explained. “Oh. Here they are. On the 
steering wheel.” He clicked on the headlights. 

“You boys okay?” Mrs. Banks asked, turning to check them out. 

“Yeah. Fine,” Terry said, sounding a little shaken. The truck would have hit 
his side of the car. 

“I’m okay,” Greg said. “Can we go back now?” 

“Don’t you want to keep going?” Mr. Banks asked, unable to hide his 
disappointment. “I thought we’d keep going to Santa Clara. Stop and get some 
ice cream or something.” 

“Greg’s right,” Mrs. Banks said softly to her husband. “Enough for tonight, 
dear. Let’s turn around.” 

“The truck didn’t come that close,” Mr. Banks argued. But he obediently 
turned off the highway and they headed for home. 

Later, safe and sound up in his room, Greg took the photograph out of his 
dresser and examined it. There was the new station wagon, the driver’s side 
caved in, the windshield shattered. 

“Weird,” he said aloud, and placed the photo in the secret compartment in 
his headboard, where he had stashed the camera. “Definitely weird.” 

He pulled the camera out of its hiding place and turned it around in his 
hands. 

I’ll try it one more time, he decided. 

He walked to his dresser and aimed at the mirror above it. 

I’ll take a picture of myself in the mirror, he thought. 



He raised the camera, then changed his mind. That won’t work, he realized. 
The flash will reflect back and spoil the photo. 

Gripping the camera in one hand, he made his way across the hall to Terry’s 
room. His brother was at his desk, typing away on his computer keyboard, his 
face bathed in the blue light of the monitor screen. 

“Terry, can I take your picture?” Greg asked meekly, holding up the camera. 

Terry typed some more, then looked up from the screen. “Hey—where’d 
you get the camera?” 

“Uh... Shari loaned it to me,” Greg told him, thinking quickly. Greg didn’t 
like to lie. But he didn’t feel like explaining to Terry how he and his friends had 
sneaked into the Coffman house and how he had made off with the camera. 

“So can I take your picture?” Greg asked. 

“I’ll probably break your camera,” Terry joked. 

“I think it’s already broken,” Greg told him. “That’s why I want to test it on 
you.” 

“Go ahead,” Terry said. He stuck out his tongue and crossed his eyes. 

Greg snapped the shutter. An undeveloped photo slid out of the slot in front. 

“Thanks. See you.” Greg headed to the door. 

“Hey—don’t I get to see it?” Terry called after him. 

“If it comes out,” Greg said, and hurried across the hall to his room. 

He sat down on the edge of the bed. Holding the photo in his lap, he stared 
at it intently as it developed. The yellows filled in first. Then the reds appeared, 
followed by shades of blue. 

“Whoa,” Greg muttered, as his brother’s face came into view. “There’s 
something definitely wrong here.” 

In the photo, Terry’s eyes weren’t crossed, and his tongue wasn’t sticking 
out. His expression was grim, frightened. He looked very upset. 

As the background came into focus, Greg had another surprise. Terry 
wasn’t in his room. He was outdoors. There were trees in the background. And a 
house. 

Greg stared at the house. It looked so familiar. 

Was that the house across the street from the playground? 

He took one more look at Terry’s frightened expression. Then he tucked the 
photo and the camera into his secret headboard compartment and carefully 
closed it. 

The camera must be broken, he decided, getting changed for bed. 



It was the best explanation he could come up with. 

Lying in bed, staring up at the shifting shadows on the ceiling, he decided 
not to think about it anymore. 

A broken camera wasn’t worth worrying about. 


* * * 


Tuesday afternoon after school, Greg hurried to meet Shari at the playground to 
watch Bird’s Little League game. 

It was a warm fall afternoon, the sun high in a cloudless sky. The outfield 
grass had been freshly mowed and filled the air with its sharp, sweet smell. 

Greg crossed the grass and squinted into the bright sunlight, searching for 
Shari. Both teams were warming up on the sides of the diamond, yelling and 
laughing, the sound of balls popping into gloves competing with their loud 
voices. 

A few parents and several kids had come to watch. Some were standing 
around, some sitting in the low bleachers along the first-base line. 

Greg spotted Shari behind the backstop and waved to her. “Did you bring 
the camera?” she asked eagerly, running over to greet him. 

He held it up. 

“Excellent,” she exclaimed, grinning. She reached for it. 

“I think it’s broken,” Greg said, holding on to the camera. “The photos just 
don’t come out right. It’s hard to explain.” 

“Maybe it’s not the photos. Maybe it’s the photographer,” Shari teased. 

“Maybe I’ll take a photo of you getting a knuckle sandwich,” Greg 
threatened. He raised the camera to his eye and pointed it at her. 

“Snap that, and I’ll take a picture of you eating the camera,” Shari 
threatened playfully. She reached up quickly and pulled the camera from his 
hand. 

“What do you want it for, anyway?” Greg asked, making a halfhearted 
attempt to grab it back. 

Shari held it away from his outstretched hand. “I want to take Bird’s picture 
when he comes up to bat. He looks just like an ostrich at the plate.” 

“I heard that.” Bird appeared beside them, pretending to be insulted. 

He looked ridiculous in his starched white uniform. The shirt was too big, 
and the pants were too short. The cap was the only thing that fit. It was blue, 



with a silver dolphin over the bill and the words PITTS LANDING DOLPHINS. 

“What kind of name is Dolphins for a baseball team?” Greg asked, 
grabbing the bill and turning the cap backward on Bird’s head. 

“All the other caps were taken,” Bird answered. “We had a choice between 
the Zephyrs and the Dolphins. None of us knew what zephyrs were, so we 
picked Dolphins.” 

Shari eyed him up and down. “Maybe you guys should play in your street 
clothes.” 

“Thanks for the encouragement,” Bird replied. He spotted the camera and 
took it from her. “Hey, you brought the camera. Does it have film?” 

“Yeah. I think so,” Greg told him. “Let me see.” He reached for the camera, 
but Bird swung it out of his grasp. 

“Hey—are you going to share this thing, Greg?” he asked. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” Greg reached again for the camera, and again 
Bird swung it away from him. 

“I mean, we all risked our lives down in that basement getting it, right?” 
Bird said. “We should all share it.” 

“Well...” Greg hadn’t thought about it. “I guess you’re right, Bird. But I’m 
the one who found it. So—” 

Shari grabbed the camera out of Bird’s hand. “I told Greg to bring it so we 
could take your picture when you’re up.” 

“As an example of good form?” Bird asked. 

“As a bad example,” Shari said. 

“You guys are just jealous,” Bird replied, frowning, “because I’m a natural 
athlete, and you can’t cross the street without falling on your face.” He turned 
the cap back around to face the front. 

“Hey, Bird—get back here!” one of the coaches called from the playing 

field. 

“I’ve got to go,” Bird said, giving them a quick wave and starting to trot 
back to his teammates. 

“No. Wait. Let me take a fast picture now,” Greg said. 

Bird stopped, turned around, and struck a pose. 

“No. I’ll take it,” Shari insisted. 

She started to raise the camera to her eye, pointing it toward Bird. And as 
she raised it, Greg grabbed for it. 

“Let me take it!” 



And the camera went off. Clicked and then flashed. 

An undeveloped photo slid out. 

“Hey, why’d you do that?” Shari asked angrily. 

“Sorry,” Greg said. “I didn’t mean to—” 

She pulled the photo out and held it in her hand. Greg and Bird came close 
to watch it develop. 

“What the heck is that?” Bird cried, staring hard at the small square as the 
colors brightened and took shape. 

“Oh, wow!” Greg cried. 

The photo showed Bird sprawled unconscious on his back on the ground, 
his mouth twisted open, his neck bent at a frightening angle, his eyes shut tight. 



12 


“Hey—what’s with this stupid camera?” Bird asked, grabbing the snapshot out 
of Shari’s hand. He tilted it from side to side, squinting at it. “It’s out of focus or 
something.” 

“Weird,” Greg said, shaking his head. 

“Hey, Bird—get over here!” the Dolphins’ coach called. 

“Coming!” Bird handed the picture back to Shari and jogged over to his 
teammates. 

Whistles blew. The two teams stopped their practicing and trotted to the 
benches along the third-base line. 

“How did this happen?” Shari asked Greg, shielding her eyes from the sun 
with one hand, holding the photo close to her face with the other. “It really looks 
like Bird is lying on the ground, knocked out or something. But he was standing 
right in front of us.” 

“I don’t get it. I really don’t,” Greg replied thoughtfully. “The camera keeps 
doing that.” 

Carrying the camera at his side, swinging it by its slender strap, he followed 
her to a shady spot beside the bleachers. 

“Look how his neck is bent,” Shari continued. “It’s so awful.” 

“There’s something definitely wrong with the camera,” Greg said. He 
started to tell her about the snapshot he took of the new station wagon, and the 
snapshot of his brother, Terry. But she interrupted him before he could get the 
words out. 

“And that picture of Michael. It showed him falling down the stairs before 
he even fell. It’s just so strange.” 

“I know,” Greg agreed. 

“Let me see that thing,” Shari said, and pulled the camera from his hand. 
“Is there any film left?” 

“I can’t tell,” Greg admitted. “I couldn’t find a film counter or anything.” 

Shari examined the camera closely, rolling it over in her hands. “It doesn’t 
say anywhere. How can you tell if it’s loaded or not?” 

Greg shrugged. 

The baseball game got under way. The Dolphins were the visiting team. 



The other team, the Cardinals, jogged out to take their positions on the field. 

A kid in the bleachers dropped his soda can. It hit the ground and spilled, 
and the kid started to cry. An old station wagon filled with teenagers cruised by, 
its radio blaring, its horn honking. 

“Where do you put the film in?” Shari asked impatiently. 

Greg stepped closer to help her examine it. “Here, I think,” he said, 
pointing. “Doesn’t the back come off?” 

Shari fiddled with it. “No, I don’t think so. Most of these automatic- 
developing cameras load in the front.” 

She pulled at the back, but the camera wouldn’t open. She tried pulling off 
the bottom. No better luck. Turning the camera, she tried pulling off the lens. It 
wouldn’t budge. 

Greg took the camera from her. “There’s no slot or opening in the front.” 

“Well, what kind of camera is it, anyway?” Shari demanded. 

“Uh... let’s see.” Greg studied the front, examined the top of the lens, then 
turned the camera over and studied the back. 

He stared up at her with a surprised look on his face. “There’s no brand 
name. Nothing.” 

“How can a camera not have a name?” Shari shouted in exasperation. She 
snatched the camera away from him and examined it closely, squinting against 
the bright afternoon sunshine. 

Finally, she handed the camera back to him, defeated. “You’re right, Greg. 
No name. No words of any kind. Nothing. What a stupid camera,” she added 
angrily. 

“Whoa. Hold on,” Greg told her. “It’s not my camera, remember? I didn’t 
buy it. I took it from the Coffman house.” 

“Well, let’s at least figure out how to open it up and look inside,” Shari said. 

The first Dolphin batter popped up to the second baseman. The second 
batter struck out on three straight swings. The dozen or so spectators shouted 
encouragement to their team. 

The little kid who had dropped his soda continued to cry. Three kids rode 
by on bikes, waving to friends on the teams but not stopping to watch. 

“I’ve tried and tried, but I can’t figure out how to open it,” Greg admitted. 

“Give it to me,” Shari said, and grabbed the camera away from him. “There 
has to be a button or something. There has to be some way of opening it. This is 
ridiculous.” 



When she couldn’t find a button or lever of any kind, she tried pulling the 
back off once again, prying it with her fingernails. Then she tried turning the 
lens, but it wouldn’t turn. 

“I’m not going to stop trying,” she said, gritting her teeth. “This camera has 
to open. It has to!” 

“Give up. You’re going to wreck it,” Greg warned, reaching for it. 

“Wreck it? How could I wreck it?” Shari demanded. “It has no moving 
parts. Nothing!” 

“This is impossible,” Greg said. 

Making a disgusted face, she handed the camera to him. “Okay, I give up. 
Check it out yourself, Greg.” 

He took the camera, started to raise it to his face, then stopped. 

Uttering a low cry of surprise, his mouth dropped open and his eyes gaped 
straight ahead. Startled, Shari turned to follow his shocked gaze. 

“Oh, no!” 

There on the ground, a few yards outside the first-base line, lay Bird. He 
was sprawled on his back, his neck bent at an odd and unnatural angle, his eyes 
shut tight. 



13 


“Bird!” Shari cried. 

Greg’s breath caught in his throat. He felt as if he were choking. “Oh!” he 
finally managed to cry out in a shrill, raspy voice. 

Bird didn’t move. 

Shari and Greg, running side by side at full speed, reached him together. 

“Bird?” Shari knelt down beside him. “Bird?” 

Bird opened one eye. “Gotcha,” he said quietly. The weird half smile 
formed on his face, and he exploded in high-pitched laughter. 

It took Shari and Greg a while to react. They both stood openmouthed, 
gaping at their laughing friend. 

Then, his heart beginning to slow to normal, Greg reached down, grabbed 
Bird with both hands, and pulled him roughly to his feet. 

“I’ll hold him while you hit him,” Greg offered, holding Bird from behind. 

“Hey, wait—” Bird protested, struggling to squirm out of Greg’s grasp. 

“Good plan,” Shari said, grinning. 

“Ow! Hey—let go! Come on! Let go!” Bird protested, trying 
unsuccessfully to wrestle free. “Come on! What’s your problem? It was a joke, 
guys.” 

“Very funny,” Shari said, giving Bird a playful punch on the shoulder. 
“You’re a riot, Bird.” 

Bird finally freed himself with a hard tug and danced away from both of 
them. “I just wanted to show you how bogus it is to get all worked up about that 
dumb camera.” 

“But, Bird—” Greg started. 

“It’s just broken, that’s all,” Bird said, brushing blades of recently cut grass 
off his uniform pants. “You think because it showed Michael falling down those 
stairs, there’s something strange with it. But that’s dumb. Real dumb.” 

“I know it,” Greg replied sharply. “But how do you explain it?” 

“I told you, man. It’s wrecked. Broken. That’s it.” 

“Bird—get over here!” a voice called, and Bird’s fielder’s glove came 
flying at his head. He caught it, waved with a grin to Shari and Greg, and jogged 
to the outfield along with the other members of the Dolphins. 



Carrying the camera tightly in one hand, Greg led the way to the bleachers. 
He and Shari sat down on the end of the bottom bench. 

Some of the spectators had lost interest in the game already and had left. A 
few kids had taken a baseball off the field and were having their own game of 
catch behind the bleachers. Across the playground, four or five kids were getting 
a game of kickball started. 

“Bird is such a dork,” Greg said, his eyes on the game. 

“He scared me to death,” Shari exclaimed. “I really thought he was hurt.” 

“What a clown,” Greg muttered. 

They watched the game in silence for a while. It wasn’t terribly interesting. 
The Dolphins were losing 12-3 going into the third inning. None of the players 
were very good. 

Greg laughed as a Cardinal batter slugged a ball that sailed out to the field 
and right over Bird’s head. 

“That’s the third ball that flew over his head!” Greg cried. 

“Guess he lost it in the sun!” Shari exclaimed, joining in the laughter. 

They both watched Bird’s long legs storking after the ball. By the time he 
managed to catch up with it and heave it toward the diamond, the Cardinal had 
already rounded the bases and scored. 

There were loud boos from the bleachers. 

The next Cardinal batter stepped to the plate. A few more kids climbed 
down from the bleachers, having seen enough. 

“It’s so hot here in the sun,” Shari said, shielding her eyes with one hand. 
“And I’ve got lots of homework. Want to leave?” 

“I just want to see the next inning,” Greg said, watching the batter swing 
and miss. “Bird is coming up next inning. I want to stay and boo him.” 

“What are friends for?” Shari said sarcastically. 

It took a long while for the Dolphins to get the third out. The Cardinals 
batted around their entire order. 

Greg’s T-shirt was drenched with sweat by the time Bird came up to the 
plate in the top of the fourth. 

Despite the loud booing from Shari and Greg, Bird managed to punch the 
ball past the shortstop for a single. 

“Lucky hit!” Greg yelled, cupping his hands into a megaphone. 

Bird pretended not to hear him. He tossed away his batter’s helmet, 
adjusted his cap, and took a short lead off first base. 



The next batter swung at the first pitch and fouled it off. 

“Let’s go,” Shari urged, pulling Greg’s arm. “It’s too hot. I’m dying of 
thirst.” 

“Let’s just see if Bird—” 

Greg didn’t finish his sentence. 

The batter hit the next ball hard. It made a loud thunk as it left the bat. 

A dozen people—players and spectators—cried out as the ball flew across 
the diamond, a sharp line drive, and slammed into the side of Bird’s head with 
another thunk. 

Greg watched in horror as the ball bounced off Bird and dribbled away onto 
the infield grass. Bird’s eyes went wide with disbelief, confusion. 

He stood frozen in place on the base path for a long moment. 

Then both of his hands shot up above his head, and he uttered a shrill cry, 
long and loud, like the high-pitched whinny of a horse. 

His eyes rolled up in his head. He sank to his knees and uttered another cry, 
softer this time. Then he collapsed, sprawling onto his back, his neck at an 
unnatural angle, his eyes closed. 

He didn’t move. 



14 


In seconds, the two coaches and both teams were running out to the fallen player, 
huddling over him, forming a tight, hushed circle around him. 

Crying “Bird! Bird!” Shari leaped off the bleachers and began running to 
the circle of horrified onlookers. 

Greg started to follow but stopped when he saw a familiar figure crossing 
the street at a full run, waving to him. 

“Terry!” Greg cried. 

Why was his brother coming to the playground? Why wasn’t he at his after¬ 
school job at the Dairy Freeze? 

“Terry? What’s happening?” Greg cried. 

Terry stopped, gasping for breath, sweat pouring down his bright red 
forehead. “I... ran... all... the... way,” he managed to utter. 

“Terry, what’s wrong?” A sick feeling crept up from Greg’s stomach. 

As Terry approached, his face held the same frightened expression as in the 
photograph Greg had snapped of him. 

The same frightened expression. With the same house behind him across 
the street. 

The snapshot had come true. Just as the snapshot of Bird lying on the 
ground had come true. 

Greg’s throat suddenly felt as dry as cotton. He realized that his knees were 
trembling. 

“Terry, what is it?” he managed to cry. 

“It’s Dad,” Terry said, putting a heavy hand on Greg’s shoulder. 

“Huh? Dad?” 

“You’ve got to come home, Greg. Dad—he’s been in a bad accident.” 

“An accident?” Greg’s head spun. Terry’s words weren’t making any sense 
to him. 

“In the new car,” Terry explained, again placing a heavy hand on Greg’s 
trembling shoulder. “The new car is totaled. Completely totaled.” 

“Oh,” Greg gasped, feeling weak. 

Terry squeezed his shoulder. “Come on. Hurry.” 



Holding the camera tightly in one hand, Greg began running after his 
brother. 

Reaching the street, he turned back to the playground to see what was 
happening with Bird. 

A large crowd was still huddled around Bird, blocking him from sight. 

But—what was that dark shadow behind the bleachers? Greg wondered. 
Someone—someone all in black—was hiding back there. 

Watching Greg? 

“Come on!” Terry urged. 

Greg stared hard at the bleachers. The dark figure pulled back out of sight. 
“Come on, Greg!” 

“I’m coming!” Greg shouted, and followed his brother toward home.

The hospital walls were pale green. The uniforms worn by the nurses scurrying 
through the brightly lit corridors were white. The floor tiles beneath Greg’s feet, 
as he hurried with his brother toward their father’s room, were dark brown with 
orange specks. 

Colors. 

All Greg could see were blurs of colors, indistinct shapes. 

His sneakers thudded noisily against the hard tile floor. He could barely 
hear them over the pounding of his heart. 

Totaled. The car had been totaled. 

Just like in the snapshot. 

Greg and Terry turned a corner. The walls in this corridor were pale yellow. 
Terry’s cheeks were red. Two doctors passed by wearing lime-green surgical 
gowns. 

Colors. Only colors. 

Greg blinked, tried to see clearly. But it was all passing by too fast, all too 
unreal. Even the sharp hospital smell, that unique aroma of rubbing alcohol, stale 
food, and disinfectant, couldn’t make it real for him. 

Then the two brothers entered their father’s room, and it all became real. 

The colors faded. The images became sharp and clear. 

Their mother jumped up from the folding chair beside the bed. “Hi, boys.” 
She clenched a wadded-up tissue in her hand. It was obvious that she had been 
crying. She forced a tight smile on her face, but her eyes were red-rimmed, her 
cheeks pale and puffy. 

Stopping just inside the doorway of the small room, Greg returned his 
mother’s greeting in a soft, choked voice. Then his eyes, focusing clearly now, 
turned to his father. 

Mr. Banks had a mummylike bandage covering his hair. One arm was in a 
cast. The other lay at his side and had a tube attached just above the wrist, 
dripping a dark liquid into the arm. The bedsheet was pulled up to his chest. 

“Hey—how’s it going, guys?” their father asked. His voice sounded fogged 
in, as if coming from far away. 

“Dad—” Terry started. 



“He’s going to be okay,” Mrs. Banks interrupted, seeing the frightened 
looks on her sons’ faces. 

“I feel great,” Mr. Banks said groggily. 

“You don’t look so great,” Greg blurted out, stepping up cautiously to the 

bed. 

“I’m okay. Really,” their father insisted. “A few broken bones. That’s it.” 
He sighed, then winced from pain. “I guess I’m lucky.” 

“You’re very lucky,” Mrs. Banks agreed quickly. 

What’s the lucky part? Greg wondered silently to himself. He couldn’t take 
his eyes off the tube stuck into his father’s arm. 

Again, he thought of the snapshot of the car. It was up in his room at home, 
tucked into the secret compartment in his headboard. 

The snapshot showing the car totaled, the driver’s side caved in. 

Should he tell them about it? 

He couldn’t decide. 

Would they believe him if he did tell them? 

“What’d you break, Dad?” Terry asked, sitting down on the radiator in front 
of the windowsill, shoving his hands into his jeans pockets. 

“Your father broke his arm and a few ribs,” Mrs. Banks answered quickly. 
“And he had a slight concussion. The doctors are watching him for internal 
injuries. But so far, so good.” 

“I was lucky,” Mr. Banks repeated. He smiled at Greg. 

“Dad, I have to tell you about this photo I took,” Greg said suddenly, 
speaking rapidly, his voice trembling with nervousness. “I took a picture of the 
new car, and—” 

“The car is completely wrecked,” Mrs. Banks interrupted. Sitting on the 
edge of the folding chair, she rubbed her fingers, working her wedding ring 
around and around, something she always did when she was nervous. “I’m glad 
you boys didn’t see it.” Her voice caught in her throat. Then she added, “It’s a 
miracle he wasn’t hurt any worse.” 

“This photo—” Greg started again. 

“Later,” his mother said brusquely. “Okay?” She gave him a meaningful 
stare. 

Greg felt his face grow hot. 

This is important, he thought. 

Then he decided they probably wouldn’t believe him, anyway. Who would 



believe such a crazy story? 

“Will we be able to get another new car?” Terry asked. 

Mr. Banks nodded carefully. “I have to call the insurance company,” he 

said. 

“ITl call them when I get home,” Mrs. Banks said. “You don’t exactly have 
a hand free.” 

Everyone laughed at that, nervous laughter. 

“I feel kind of sleepy,” Mr. Banks said. His eyes were halfway closed, his 
voice muffled. 

“It’s the painkillers the doctors gave you,” Mrs. Banks told him. She leaned 
forward and patted his hand. “Get some sleep. I’ll come back in a few hours.” 

She stood up, still fiddling with her wedding band, and motioned with her 
head toward the door. 

“Bye, Dad,” Greg and Terry said in unison. 

Their father muttered a reply. They followed their mother out the door. 

“What happened?” Terry asked, as they made their way past a nurses’ 
station, then down the long, pale yellow corridor. “I mean, the accident.” 

“Some guy ran right through a red light,” Mrs. Banks said, her red-rimmed 
eyes focused straight ahead. “He plowed right into your father’s side of the car. 
Said his brakes weren’t working.” She shook her head, tears forming in the 
corners of her eyes. “I don’t know,” she said, sighing. “I just don’t know what to 
say. Thank goodness he’s going to be okay.” 

They turned into the green corridor, walking side by side. Several people 
were waiting patiently for the elevator at the far end of the hall. 

Once again, Greg found himself thinking of the snapshots he had taken with 
the weird camera. 

First Michael. Then Terry. Then Bird. Then his father. 

All four photos had shown something terrible. Something terrible that 
hadn’t happened yet. 

And then all four photos had come true. 

Greg felt a chill as the elevator doors opened and the small crowd of people 
moved forward to squeeze inside. 

What’s the truth about the camera? he wondered. 

Does the camera show the future ? 

Or does it actually cause bad things to happen? 



16 


“Yeah. I know Bird’s okay,” Greg said into the phone receiver. “I saw him 
yesterday, remember? He was lucky. Real lucky. He didn’t have a concussion or 
anything.” 

On the other end of the line—in the house next door—Shari agreed, then 
repeated her request. 

“No, Shari. I really don’t want to,” Greg replied vehemently. 

“Bring it,” Shari demanded. “It’s my birthday.” 

“I don’t want to bring the camera. It’s not a good idea. Really,” Greg told 
her. 

It was the next weekend. Saturday afternoon. Greg had been nearly out the 
door, on his way to Shari’s birthday party, when the phone rang. 

“Hi, Greg. Why aren’t you on your way to my party?” Shari had asked 
when he’d run to pick up the receiver. 

“Because I’m on the phone with you,” Greg had replied drily. 

“Well, bring the camera, okay?” 

Greg hadn’t looked at the camera, hadn’t removed it from its hiding place 
since his father’s accident. 

“I don’t want to bring it,” he insisted, despite Shari’s high-pitched demands. 
“Don’t you understand, Shari? I don’t want anyone else to get hurt.” 

“Oh, Greg,” she said, talking to him as if he were a three-year-old. “You 
don’t really believe that, do you? You don’t really believe that camera can hurt 
people.” 

Greg was silent for a moment. “I don’t know what I believe,” he said 
finally. “I only know that first, Michael, then, Bird—” 

Greg swallowed hard. “And I had a dream, Shari. Last night.” 

“Huh? What kind of dream?” Shari asked impatiently. 

“It was about the camera. I was taking everyone’s picture. My whole family 
—Mom, Dad, and Terry. They were barbecuing. In the backyard. I held up the 
camera. I kept saying, ‘Say cheese, say cheese,’ over and over. And when I 
looked through the viewfinder, they were smiling back at me—but... they were 
skeletons. All of them. Their skin was gone, and—and...” 

Greg’s voice trailed off. 



“What a dumb dream,” Shari said, laughing. 

“But that’s why I don’t want to bring the camera,” Greg insisted. “I think 

55 

“Bring it, Greg,” she interrupted. “It’s not your camera, you know. All four 
of us were in the Coffman house. It belongs to all four of us. Bring it.” 

“But why, Shari?” Greg demanded. 

“It’ll be a goof, that’s all. It takes such weird pictures.” 

“That’s for sure,” Greg muttered. 

“We don’t have anything else to do for my party,” Shari told him. “I wanted 
to rent a video, but my mom says we have to go outdoors. She doesn’t want her 
precious house messed up. So I thought we could take everyone’s picture with 
the weird camera. You know. See what strange things come out.” 

“Shari, I really don’t—” 

“Bring it,” she ordered. And hung up. 

Greg stood for a long time staring at the phone receiver, thinking hard, 
trying to decide what to do. 

Then he replaced the receiver and headed reluctantly up to his room. 

With a loud sigh, he pulled the camera from its hiding place in his 
headboard. “It’s Shari’s birthday, after all,” he said aloud to himself. 

His hands were trembling as he picked it up. He realized he was afraid of it. 

Ishouldn’t be doing this, he thought, feeling a heavy knot of dread in the pit 
of his stomach. 

I know I shouldn’t be doing this.

“How’s it going, Bird?” Greg called, making his way across the flagstone patio 
to Shari’s backyard. 

“I’m feeling okay,” Bird said, slapping his friend a high five. “The only 
problem is, ever since that ball hit me,” Bird continued, frowning, “from time to 
time I start —pluuccck cluuuck cluuuuck !—clucking like a chicken!” He flapped 
his arms and started strutting across the backyard, clucking at the top of his 
voice. 

“Hey, Bird—go lay an egg!” someone yelled, and everyone laughed. 

“Bird’s at it again,” Michael said, shaking his head. He gave Greg a friendly 
punch on the shoulder. Michael, his red hair unbrushed as usual, was wearing 
faded jeans and a flowered Hawaiian sports shirt about three sizes too big for 
him. 

“Where’d you get that shirt?” Greg asked, holding Michael at arm’s length 
by the shoulders to admire it. 

“In a cereal box,” Bird chimed in, still flapping his arms. 

“My grandmother gave it to me,” Michael said, frowning. 

“He made it in home ec,” Bird interrupted. One joke was never enough. 

“But why did you wear it?” Greg asked. 

Michael shrugged. “Everything else was dirty.” 

Bird bent down, picked up a small clump of dirt from the lawn, and rubbed 
it on the back of Michael’s shirt. “Now this one’s dirty, too,” he declared. 

“Hey, you—” Michael reacted with playful anger, grabbing Bird and 
shoving him into the hedge. 

“Did you bring it?” 

Hearing Shari’s voice, Greg turned toward the house and saw her jogging 
across the patio in his direction. Her black hair was pulled back in a single braid, 
and she had on an oversized silky yellow top that came down over black spandex 
leggings. 

“Did you bring it?” she repeated eagerly. A charm bracelet filled with tiny 
silver charms—a birthday present—jangled at her wrist. 

“Yeah.” Greg reluctantly held up the camera. 

“Excellent,” she declared. 



“I really don’t want—” Greg started. 

“You can take my picture first since it’s my birthday,” Shari interrupted. 
“Here. How’s this?” She struck a sophisticated pose, leaning against a tree with 
her hand behind her head. 

Greg obediently raised the camera. “Are you sure you want to do this, 
Shari?” 

“Yeah. Come on. I want to take everyone’s picture.” 

“But it’ll probably come out weird,” Greg protested. 

“I know,” Shari replied impatiently, holding her pose. “That’s the fun of it.” 

“But, Shari—” 

“Michael puked on his shirt,” he heard Bird telling someone near the hedge. 

“I did not!” Michael was screaming. 

“You mean it looks like that naturally?” Bird, asked. 

Greg could hear a lot of raucous laughing, all of it at Michael’s expense. 

“Will you take the picture?” Shari cried, holding on to the slender trunk of 
the tree. 

Greg pointed the lens at her and pressed the button. The camera whirred, 
and the undeveloped white square rolled out. 

“Hey, are we the only boys invited?” Michael asked, stepping up to Shari. 

“Yeah. Just you three,” Shari said. “And nine girls.” 

“Oh, wow.” Michael made a face. 

“Take Michael’s picture next,” Shari told Greg. 

“No way!” Michael replied quickly, raising his hands as if to shield himself 
and backing away. “The last time you took my picture with that thing, I fell 
down the stairs.” 

Trying to get away, Michael backed right into Nina Blake, one of Shari’s 
friends. She reacted with a squeal of surprise, then gave him a playful shove, and 
he kept right on backing away. 

“Michael, come on. It’s my party,” Shari called. 

“What are we going to do? Is this it?” Nina demanded from halfway across 
the yard. 

“I thought we’d take everyone’s picture and then play a game or 
something,” Shari told her. 

“A game?” Bird chimed in. “You mean like Spin the Bottle?” 

A few kids laughed. 

“Truth or Dare!” Nina suggested. 



“Yeah. Truth or Dare!” a couple of other girls called in agreement. 

“Oh, no,” Greg groaned quietly to himself. Tmth or Dare meant a lot of 
kissing and awkward, embarrassing stunts. 

Nine girls and only three boys. 

It was going to be really embarrassing. 

How could Shari do this to us? he wondered. 

“Well, did it come out?” Shari asked, grabbing his arm. “Let me see.” 

Greg was so upset about having to play Truth or Dare, he had forgotten 
about the snapshot developing in his hand. He held it up, and they both 
examined it. 

“Where am I?” Shari asked in surprise. “What were you aiming at? You 
missed me!” 

“Huh?” Greg stared at the snapshot. There was the tree. But no Shari. 
“Weird! I pointed it right at you. I lined it up carefully,” he protested. 

“Well, you missed me. I’m not in the shot,” Shari replied disgustedly. 

“But, Shari—” 

“I mean, come on —I’m not invisible, Greg. I’m not a vampire or 
something. I can see my reflection in mirrors. And I do usually show up in 
photos.” 

“But, look—” Greg stared hard at the photograph. “There’s the tree you 
were leaning against. You can see the tree trunk clearly. And there’s the spot 
where you were standing.” 

“But where am I?” Shari demanded, jangling her charm bracelet noisily. 
“Never mind.” She grabbed the snapshot from him and tossed it on the grass. 
“Take another one. Quick.” 

“Well, okay. But—” Greg was still puzzling over the photo. Why hadn’t 
Shari shown up in it? He bent down, picked it up, and shoved it into his pocket. 

“Stand closer this time,” she instructed. 

Greg moved a few steps closer, carefully centered Shari in the viewfinder, 
and snapped the picture. A square of film zipped out the front. 

Shari walked over and pulled the picture from the camera. “This one better 
turn out,” she said, staring hard at it as the colors began to darken and take form. 

“If you really want pictures of everyone, we should get another camera,” 
Greg said, his eyes also locked on the snapshot. 

“Hey—I don’t believe it!” Shari cried. 

Again, she was invisible. 



The tree photographed clearly, in perfect focus. But Shari was nowhere to 
be seen. 

“You were right. The dumb camera is broken,” she said disgustedly, 
handing the photo to Greg. “Forget it.” She turned away from him and called to 
the others. “Hey, guys—Truth or Dare!” 

There were some cheers and some groans. 

Shari headed them back to the woods behind her backyard to play. “More 
privacy,” she explained. There was a circular clearing just beyond the trees, a 
perfect, private place. 

The game was just as embarrassing as Greg had imagined. Among the boys, 
only Bird seemed to be enjoying it. Bird loves dumb stuff like this, Greg thought 
with some envy. 

Luckily, after little more than half an hour, he heard Mrs. Walker, Shari’s 
mom, calling from the house, summoning them back to cut the birthday cake. 

“Aw, too bad,” Greg said sarcastically. “Just when the game was getting 
good.” 

“We have to get out of the woods, anyway,” Bird said, grinning. “Michael’s 
shirt is scaring the squirrels.” 

Laughing and talking about the game, the kids made their way back to the 
patio, where the pink-and-white birthday cake, candles all lit, was waiting on the 
round umbrella table. 

“I must be a pretty bad mom,” Mrs. Walker joked, “allowing you all to go 
off into the woods by yourselves.” 

Some of the girls laughed. 

Cake knife in her hand, Mrs. Walker looked around. “Where’s Shari?” 

Everyone turned their eyes to search the backyard. “She was with us in the 
woods,” Nina told Mrs. Walker. “Just a minute ago.” 

“Hey, Shari!” Bird called, cupping his hands to his mouth as a megaphone. 
“Earth calling Shari! It’s cake time!” 

No reply. 

No sign of her. 

“Did she go in the house?” Greg asked. 

Mrs. Walker shook her head. “No. She didn’t come by the patio. Is she still 
in the woods?” 

“I’ll go check,” Bird told her. Calling Shari’s name, he ran to the edge of 
the trees at the back of the yard. Then he disappeared into the trees, still calling. 



A few minutes later, Bird emerged, signaling to the others with a shrug. 
No sign of her. 

They searched the house. The front yard. The woods again. 

But Shari had vanished. 



18 


Greg sat in the shade with his back against the tree trunk, the camera on the 
ground at his side, and watched the blue-uniformed policemen. 

They covered the backyard and could be seen bending low as they searched 
around in the woods. He could hear their voices but couldn’t make out what they 
were saying. Their faces were intent, bewildered. 

More policemen arrived, grim-faced, businesslike. 

And then, even more blue-uniformed policemen. 

Mrs. Walker had called her husband home from a golf game. They sat 
huddled together on canvas chairs in a corner of the patio. They whispered to 
each other, their eyes darting across the yard. Holding hands, they looked pale 
and worried. 

Everyone else had left. 

On the patio, the table was still set. The birthday candles had burned all the 
way down, the blue-and-red wax melting in hard puddles on the pink-and-white 
icing, the cake untouched. 

“No sign of her,” a red-cheeked policeman with a white-blond mustache 
was telling the Walkers. He pulled off his cap and scratched his head, revealing 
short blond hair. 

“Did someone... take her away?” Mr. Walker asked, still holding his wife’s 
hand. 

“No sign of a struggle,” the policeman said. “No sign of anything, really.” 

Mrs. Walker sighed loudly and lowered her head. “I just don’t understand 
it.” 

There was a long, painful silence. 

“We’ll keep looking,” the policeman said. “I’m sure we’ll find... 
something.” 

He turned and headed toward the woods. 

“Oh. Hi.” He stopped in front of Greg, staring down at him as if seeing him 
for the first time. “You still here, son? All the other guests have gone home.” He 
pushed his hair back and replaced his cap. 

“Yeah, I know,” Greg replied solemnly, lifting the camera into his lap. 

“I’m Officer Riddick,” he said. 



“Yeah, I know,” Greg repeated softly. 

“How come you didn’t go home after we talked with you, like the others?” 
Officer Riddick asked. 

“I’m just upset, I guess,” Greg told him. “I mean, Shari’s a good friend, you 
know?” He cleared his throat, which felt dry and tight. “Besides, I live right over 
there.” He gestured with his head to his house next door. 

“Well, you might as well go home, son,” Officer Riddick said, turning his 
eyes to the woods with a frown. “This search could take a long time. We haven’t 
found a thing back there yet.” 

“I know,” Greg replied, rubbing his hand against the back of the camera. 

And I know that this camera is the reason Shari is missing, he thought, 
feeling miserable and frightened. 

“One minute she was there. The next minute she was gone,” the policeman 
said, studying Greg’s face as if looking for answers there. 

“Yeah,” Greg replied. “It’s so weird.” 

It’s weirder than anyone knows, Greg thought. 

The camera made her invisible. The camera did it. 

First, she vanished from the snapshot. 

Then she vanished in real life. 

The camera did it to her. I don’t know how. But it did. 

“Do you have something more to tell me?” Officer Riddick asked, hands 
resting on his hips, his right hand just above the worn brown holster that carried 
his pistol. “Did you see something? Something that might give us a clue, help us 
out? Something you didn’t remember to tell me before?” 

Should I tell him? Greg wondered. 

If I tell him about the camera, he’ll ask where I got it. And I’ll have to tell 
him that I got it in the Coffman house. And we’ll all get in trouble for breaking in 
there. 

But—big deal. Shari is missing. Gone. Vanished. That’s a lot more 
important. 

I should tell him, Greg decided. 

But then he hesitated. If I tell him, he won’t believe me. 

If I tell him, how will it help bring Shari back? 

“You look very troubled,” Officer Riddick said, squatting down next to 
Greg in the shade. “What’s your name again?” 

“Greg. Greg Banks.” 



“Well, you look very troubled, Greg,” the policeman repeated softly. “Why 
don’t you tell me what’s bothering you? Why don’t you tell me what’s on your 
mind? I think it’ll make you feel a lot better.” 

Greg took a deep breath and glanced up to the patio. Mrs. Walker had 
covered her face with her hands. Her husband was leaning over her, trying to 
comfort her. 

“Well...” Greg started. 

“Go ahead, son,” Officer Riddick urged softly. “Do you know where Shari 

is?” 

“It’s this camera,” Greg blurted out. He suddenly could feel the blood 
throbbing against his temples. 

He took a deep breath and then continued. “You see, this camera is weird.” 

“What do you mean?” Officer Riddick asked quietly. 

Greg took another deep breath. “I took Shari’s picture. Before. When I first 
arrived. I took two pictures. And she was invisible. In both of them. See?” 

Officer Riddick closed his eyes, then opened them. “No. I don’t 
understand.” 

“Shari was invisible in the picture. Everything else was there. But she 
wasn’t. She had vanished, see? And then later, she vanished for real. The camera 
—it predicts the future, I guess. Or it makes bad things happen.” Greg raised the 
camera, attempting to hand it to the policeman. 

Officer Riddick made no attempt to take it. He just stared hard at Greg, his 
eyes narrowing, his expression hardening. 

Greg felt a sudden stab of fear. 

Oh, no, he thought. Why is he looking at me like that? What is he going to 

do? 



19 


Greg continued to hold the camera out to the policeman. 

But Officer Riddick quickly climbed to his feet. “The camera makes bad 
things happen?” His eyes burned into Greg’s. 

“Yes,” Greg told him. “It isn’t my camera, see? And every time I take a 
picture—” 

“Son, that’s enough,” Officer Riddick said gently. He reached down and 
rested a hand on Greg’s trembling shoulder. “I think you’re very upset, Greg,” he 
said, his voice almost a whisper. “I don’t blame you. This is very upsetting for 
everyone.” 

“But it’s true —” Greg started to insist. 

“I’m going to ask that policeman over there,” Officer Riddick said, 
pointing, “to take you home now. And I’m going to have him tell your parents 
that you’ve been through a very frightening experience.” 

/knew he wouldn’t believe me, Greg thought angrily. 

How could I have been so stupid? 

Now he thinks I’m some kind of a nutcase. 

Officer Riddick called to a policeman at the side of the house near the 
hedge. 

“No, that’s okay,” Greg said, quickly pulling himself up, cradling the 
camera in his hand. “I can make it home okay.” 

Officer Riddick eyed him suspiciously. “You sure?” 

“Yeah. I can walk by myself.” 

“If you have anything to tell me later,” Officer Riddick said, lowering his 
gaze to the camera, “just call the station, okay?” 

“Okay,” Greg replied, walking slowly toward the front of the house. 

“Don’t worry, Greg. We’ll do our best,” Officer Riddick called after him. 
“We’ll find her. Put the camera away and try to get some rest, okay?” 

“Okay,” Greg muttered. 

He hurried past the Walkers, who were still huddled together under the 
umbrella on the patio. 

Why was I so stupid? he asked himself as he walked home. Why did I 
expect that policeman to believe such a weird story? 



I’m not even sure I believe it myself. 

A few minutes later, he pulled open the back screen door and entered his 
kitchen. “Anybody home?” 

No reply. 

He headed through the back hall toward the living room. “Anyone home?” 

No one. 

Terry was at work. His mother must have been visiting his dad at the 
hospital. 

Greg felt bad. He really didn’t feel like being alone now. He really wanted 
to tell them about what had happened to Shari. He really wanted to talk to them. 

Still cradling the camera, he climbed the stairs to his room. 

He stopped in the doorway, blinked twice, then uttered a cry of horror. 

His books were scattered all over the floor. The covers had been pulled off 
his bed. His desk drawers were all open, their contents strewn around the room. 
The desk lamp was on its side on the floor. All of his clothes had been pulled 
from the dresser and his closet and tossed everywhere. 

Someone had been in Greg’s room—and had turned it upside down! 



20 


Who would do this? Greg asked himself, staring in horror at his ransacked room. 

Who would tear my room apart like this? 

He realized that he knew the answer. He knew who would do it, who had 
done it. 

Someone looking for the camera. 

Someone desperate to get the camera back. 

Spidey? 

The creepy guy who dressed all in black was living in the Coffman house. 
Was he the owner of the camera? 

Yes, Greg knew, Spidey had done it. 

Spidey had been watching Greg, spying on Greg from behind the bleachers 
at the Little League game. 

He knew that Greg had his camera. And he knew where Greg lived. 

That thought was the most chilling of all. 

He knew where Greg lived. 

Greg turned away from the chaos in his room, leaned against the wall of the 
hallway, and closed his eyes. 

He pictured Spidey, the dark figure creeping along so evilly on his spindly 
legs. He pictured him inside the house, Greg’s house. Inside Greg’s room. 

He was here, thought Greg. He pawed through all my things. He wrecked 
my room. 

Greg stepped back into his room. He felt all mixed up. He felt like shouting 
angrily and crying for help all at once. 

But he was all alone. No one to hear him. No one to help him. 

What now? he wondered. What now? 

Suddenly, leaning against the doorframe, staring at his ransacked room, he 
knew what he had to do. 



21 


“Hey, Bird, it’s me.” 

Greg held the receiver in one hand and wiped the sweat off his forehead 
with the other. He’d never worked so hard—or so fast—in all his life. 

“Did they find Shari?” Bird asked eagerly. 

“I haven’t heard. I don’t think so,” Greg said, his eyes surveying his room. 
Almost back to normal. 

He had put everything back, cleaned and straightened. His parents would 
never guess. 

“Listen, Bird, I’m not calling about that,” Greg said, speaking rapidly into 
the phone. “Call Michael for me, okay? Meet me at the playground. By the 
baseball diamond.” 

“When? Now?” Bird asked, sounding confused. 

“Yeah,” Greg told him. “We have to meet. It’s important.” 

“It’s almost dinnertime,” Bird protested. “I don’t know if my parents—” 

“It’s important,” Greg repeated impatiently. “I’ve got to see you guys. 
Okay?” 

“Well... maybe I can sneak out for a few minutes,” Bird said, lowering his 
voice. And then Greg heard him shout to his mother: “It’s no one, Ma! I’m 
talking to no one!” 

Boy, that’s quick thinking! Greg thought sarcastically. He’s a worse liar than 
I am! 

And then he heard Bird call to his mom: “I know I’m on the phone. But I’m 
not talking to anyone. It’s only Greg.” 

Thanks a lot, pal, Greg thought. 

“I gotta go,” Bird said. 

“Get Michael, okay?” Greg urged. 

“Yeah. Okay. See you.” He hung up. 

Greg replaced the receiver, then listened for his mother. Silence downstairs. 
She still wasn’t home. She didn’t know about Shari, Greg realized. He knew she 
and his dad were going to be very upset. 

Very upset. 

Almost as upset as he was. 



Thinking about his missing friend, he went to his bedroom window and 
looked down on her yard next door. It was deserted now. 

The policemen had all left. Shari’s shaken parents must have gone inside. 

A squirrel sat under the wide shade of the big tree, gnawing furiously at an 
acorn, another acorn at his feet. 

In the corner of the window, Greg could see the birthday cake, still sitting 
forlornly on the deserted table, the places all set, the decorations still standing. 

A birthday party for ghosts. 

Greg shuddered. 

“Shari is alive,” he said aloud. “They’ll find her. She’s alive.” 

He knew what he had to do now. 

Forcing himself away from the window, he hurried to meet his two friends.

“No way,” Bird said heatedly, leaning against the bleacher bench. “Have you 
gone totally bananas?” 

Swinging the camera by its cord, Greg turned hopefully to Michael. But 
Michael avoided Greg’s stare. “I’m with Bird,” he said, his eyes on the camera. 

Since it was just about dinnertime, the playground was nearly deserted. A 
few little kids were on the swings at the other end. Two kids were riding their 
bikes around and around the soccer field. 

“I thought maybe you guys would come with me,” Greg said, disappointed. 
He kicked up a clump of grass with his sneaker. “I have to return this thing,” he 
continued, raising the camera. “I know it’s what I have to do. I have to put it 
back where I found it.” 

“No way,” Bird repeated, shaking his head. “I’m not going back to the 
Coffman house. Once was enough.” 

“Chicken?” Greg asked angrily. 

“Yeah,” Bird quickly admitted. 

“You don’t have to take it back,” Michael argued. He pulled himself up the 
side of the bleachers, climbed onto the third deck of seats, then lowered himself 
to the ground. 

“What do you mean?” Greg asked impatiently, kicking at the grass. 

“Just toss it, Greg,” Michael urged, making a throwing motion with one 
hand. “Heave it. Throw it in the trash somewhere.” 

“Yeah. Or leave it right here,” Bird suggested. He reached for the camera. 
“Give it to me. I’ll hide it under the seats.” 

“You don’t understand,” Greg said, swinging the camera out of Bird’s 
reach. “Throwing it away won’t do any good.” 

“Why not?” Bird asked, making another swipe for the camera. 

“Spidey’ll just come back for it,” Greg told him heatedly. “He’ll come back 
to my room looking for it. He’ll come after me. I know it.” 

“But what if we get caught taking it back?” Michael asked. 

“Yeah. What if Spidey’s there in the Coffman house, and he catches us?” 
Bird said. 

“You don’t understand,” Greg cried. “He knows where I live! He was in my 



house. He was in my room! He wants his camera back, and— 

“Here. Give it to me,” Bird said. “We don’t have to go back to that house. 
He can find it. Right here.” 

He grabbed again for the camera. 

Greg held tightly to the strap and tried to tug it away. 

But Bird grabbed the side of the camera. 

“No!” Greg cried out as it flashed. And whirred. 

A square of film slid out. 

“No!” Greg cried to Bird, horrified, staring at the white square as it started 
to develop. “You took my picture!” 

His hand trembling, he pulled the snapshot from the camera. 

What would it show? 



23 


“Sorry,” Bird said. “I didn’t mean to—” 

Before he could finish his sentence, a voice interrupted from behind the 
bleachers. “Hey—what’ve you got there?” 

Greg looked up from the developing snapshot in surprise. Two tough¬ 
looking boys stepped out of the shadows, their expressions hard, their eyes on 
the camera. 

He recognized them immediately—Joey Ferris and Mickey Ward—two 
ninth-graders who hung out together, always swaggering around, acting tough, 
picking on kids younger than them. 

Their specialty was taking kids’ bikes, riding off on them, and dumping 
them somewhere. There was a rumor around school that Mickey had once beaten 
up a kid so badly that the kid was crippled for life. But Greg believed Mickey 
made up that rumor and spread it himself. 

Both boys were big for their age. Neither of them did very well in school. 
And even though they were always stealing bikes and skateboards, and 
terrorizing little kids, and getting into fights, neither of them ever seemed to get 
into serious trouble. 

Joey had short blond hair, slicked straight up, and wore a diamondlike stud 
in one ear. Mickey had a round, red face full of pimples, stringy black hair down 
to his shoulders, and was working a toothpick between his teeth. Both boys were 
wearing heavy-metal T-shirts and jeans. 

“Hey, I’ve gotta get home,” Bird said quickly, half stepping, half dancing 
away from the bleachers. 

“Me, too,” Michael said, unable to keep the fear from showing on his face. 

Greg tucked the snapshot into his jeans pocket. 

“Hey, you found my camera,” Joey said, grabbing it out of Greg’s hand. His 
small gray eyes burned into Greg’s as if searching for a reaction. “Thanks, man.” 

“Give it back, Joey,” Greg said with a sigh. 

“Yeah. Don’t take that camera,” Mickey told his friend, a smile spreading 
over his round face. “It’s mine!” He wrestled the camera away from Joey. 

“Give it back,” Greg insisted angrily, reaching out his hand. Then he 
softened his tone. “Come on, guys. It isn’t mine.” 



“I know it isn’t yours,” Mickey said, grinning. “Because it’s minel” 

“I have to give it back to the owner,” Greg told him, trying not to whine but 
hearing his voice edge up. 

“No, you don’t. I’m the owner now,” Mickey insisted. 

“Haven’t you ever heard of finders keepers?” Joey asked, leaning over Greg 
menacingly. He was about six inches taller than Greg and a lot more muscular. 

“Hey, let him have the thing,” Michael whispered in Greg’s ear. “You 
wanted to get rid of it—right?” 

“No!” Greg protested. 

“What’s your problem, Freckle Face?” Joey asked Michael, eyeing him up 
and down. 

“No problem,” Michael said meekly. 

“Hey—say cheese!” Mickey aimed the camera at Joey. 

“Don’t do it,” Bird interrupted, waving his hands frantically. 

“Why not?” Joey demanded. 

“Because your face will break the camera,” Bird said, laughing. 

“You’re real funny,” Joey said sarcastically, narrowing his eyes 
threateningly, hardening his features. “You want that stupid smile to be 
permanent?” He raised a big fist. 

“I know this kid,” Mickey told Joey, pointing at Bird. “Thinks he’s hot 
stuff.” 

Both boys stared hard at Bird, trying to scare him. 

Bird swallowed hard. He took a step back, bumping into the bleachers. “No, 
I don’t,” he said softly. “I don’t think I’m hot stuff.” 

“He looks like something I stepped in yesterday,” Joey said. 

He and Mickey cracked up, laughing high-pitched hyena laughs and 
slapping each other high fives. 

“Listen, guys. I really need the camera back,” Greg said, reaching out a 
hand to take it. “It isn’t any good, anyway. It’s broken. And it doesn’t belong to 
me.” 

“Yeah, that’s right. It’s broken,” Michael added, nodding his head. 

“Yeah. Right,” Mickey said sarcastically. “Let’s just see.” He raised the 
camera again and pointed it at Joey. 

“Really, guys. I need it back,” Greg said desperately. 

If they took a picture with the camera, Greg realized, they might discover 
its secret. That its snapshots showed the future, showed only bad things 



happening to people. That the camera was evil. Maybe it even caused evil. 

“Say cheese,” Mickey instructed Joey. 

“Just snap the stupid thing!” Joey replied impatiently. 

No, Greg thought. I can’t let this happen. I’ve got to return the camera to 
the Coffman house, to Spidey. 

Impulsively, Greg leaped forward. With a cry, he snatched the camera away 
from Mickey’s face. 

“Hey—” Mickey reacted in surprise. 

“Let’s go !” Greg shouted to Bird and Michael. 

And without another word, the three friends turned and began running 
across the deserted playground toward their homes. 

His heart thudding in his chest, Greg gripped the camera tightly and ran as 
fast as he could, his sneakers pounding over the dry grass. 

They’re going to catch us, Greg thought, panting loudly now as he raced 
toward the street. They’re going to catch us and pound us. They’re going to take 
back the camera. We’re dead meat. Dead meat. 

Greg and his friends didn’t turn around until they were across the street. 
Breathing noisily, they looked back—and cried out in relieved surprise. 

Joey and Mickey hadn’t budged from beside the bleachers. They hadn’t 
chased after them. They were leaning against the bleachers, laughing. 

“Catch you later, guys!” Joey called after them. 

“Yeah. Later,” Mickey repeated. 

They both burst out laughing again, as if they had said something hilarious. 
“That was close,” Michael said, still breathing hard. 

“They mean it,” Bird said, looking very troubled. “They’ll catch us later. 
We’re history.” 

“Tough talk. They’re just a lot of hot air,” Greg insisted. 

“Oh, yeah?” Michael cried. “Then why did we run like that?” 

“Because we’re late for dinner,” Bird joked. “See you guys. I’m gonna 
catch it if I don’t hurry.” 

“But the camera—” Greg protested, still gripping it tightly in one hand. 

“It’s too late,” Michael said, nervously raking a hand back through his red 

hair. 

“Yeah. We’ll have to do it tomorrow or something,” Bird agreed. 

“Then you guys will come with me?” Greg asked eagerly. 

“Uh... I’ve gotta go,” Bird said without answering. 



“Me, too,” Michael said quickly, avoiding Greg’s stare. 

All three of them turned their eyes back to the playground. Joey and 
Mickey had disappeared. Probably off to terrorize some other kids. 

“Later,” Bird said, slapping Greg on the shoulder as he headed away. The 
three friends split up, running in different directions across lawns and driveways, 
heading home. 

Greg had run all the way to his front yard before he remembered the 
snapshot he had shoved into his jeans pocket. 

He stopped in the driveway and pulled it out. 

The sun was lowering behind the garage. He held the snapshot up close to 
his face to see it clearly. 

“Oh, no!” he cried. “I don’t believe it!” 



24 


“This is impossible !” Greg cried aloud, gaping at the snapshot in his trembling 
hand. 

How had Shari gotten into the photo? 

It had been taken a few minutes before, in front of the bleachers on the 
playground. 

But there was Shari, standing close beside Greg. 

His hand trembling, his mouth hanging open in disbelief, Greg goggled at 
the photo. 

It was very clear, very sharp. There they were on the playground. He could 
see the baseball diamond in the background. 

And there they were. Greg and Shari. 

Shari standing so clear, so sharp—right next to him. 

And they were both staring straight ahead, their eyes wide, their mouths 
open, their expressions frozen in horror as a large shadow covered them both. 

“Shari?” Greg cried, lowering the snapshot and darting his eyes over the 
front yard. “Are you here? Can you hear me?” 

He listened. 

Silence. 

He tried again. 

“Shari? Are you here?” 

“Greg!” a voice called. 

Uttering a startled cry, Greg spun around. “Huh?” 

“Greg!” the voice repeated. It took him a while to realize that it was his 
mother, calling to him from the front door. 

“Oh. Hi, Mom.” Feeling dazed, he slid the snapshot back into his jeans 
pocket. 

“Where 5 ve you been?” his mother asked as he made his way to the door. “I 
heard about Shari. I’ve been so upset. I didn’t know where you were.” 

“Sorry, Mom,” Greg said, kissing her on the cheek. “I—I should’ve left a 
note.” 

He stepped into the house, feeling strange and out of sorts, sad and 



confused and frightened, all at the same time. 


Two days later, on a day of high gray clouds, the air hot and smoggy, Greg paced 
back and forth in his room after school. 

The house was empty except for him. Terry had gone off a few hours before 
to his after-school job at the Dairy Freeze. Mrs. Banks had driven to the hospital 
to pick up Greg’s dad, who was finally coming home. 

Greg knew he should be happy about his dad’s return. But there were still 
too many things troubling him, tugging at his mind. 

Frightening him. 

For one thing, Shari still hadn’t been found. 

The police were completely baffled. Their new theory was that she’d been 
kidnapped. 

Her frantic, grieving parents waited home by the phone. But no kidnappers 
called to demand a ransom. 

There were no clues of any kind. 

Nothing to do but wait. And hope. 

As time passed, Greg felt more and more guilty. He was sure Shari hadn’t 
been kidnapped. He knew that somehow, the camera had made her disappear. 

But he couldn’t tell anyone else what he believed. 

No one would believe him. Anyone he tried to tell the story to would think 
he was crazy. 

Cameras can’t be evil, after all. 

Cameras can’t make people fall down stairs. Or crash their cars. 

Or vanish from sight. 

Cameras can only record what they see. 

Greg stared out of his window, pressing his forehead against the glass, 
looking down on Shari’s backyard. “Shari—where are you?” he asked aloud, 
staring at the tree where she had posed. 

The camera was still hidden in the secret compartment in his headboard. 
Neither Bird nor Michael would agree to help Greg return it to the Coffman 
house. 

Besides, Greg had decided to hold on to it a while longer, in case he needed 
it as proof. 

In case he decided to confide his fears about it to someone. 

In case... 



His other fear was that Spidey would come back, back to Greg’s room, back 
for the camera. 

So much to be frightened about. 

He pushed himself away from the window. He had spent so much time in 
the past couple of days staring down at Shari’s empty backyard. 

Thinking. Thinking. 

With a sigh, he reached into the headboard and pulled out two of the 
snapshots he had hidden in there along with the camera. 

The two snapshots were the ones taken the past Saturday at Shari’s birthday 
party. Holding one in each hand, Greg stared at them, hoping he could see 
something new, something he hadn’t noticed before. 

But the photos hadn’t changed. They still showed her tree, her backyard, 
green in the sunlight. And no Shari. No one where Shari had been standing. As if 
the lens had penetrated right through her. 

Staring at the photos, Greg let out a cry of anguish. 

If only he had never gone into the Coffman house. 

If only he had never stolen the camera. 

If only he had never taken any photos with it. 

If only... if only... if only... 

Before he realized what he was doing, he was ripping the two snapshots 
into tiny pieces. 

Panting loudly, his chest heaving, he tore up the snapshots and let the pieces 
fall to the floor. 

When he had ripped them both into tiny shards of paper, he flung himself 
facedown on his bed and closed his eyes, waiting for his heart to stop pounding, 
waiting for the heavy feeling of guilt and horror to lift. 

Two hours later, the phone by his bed rang. 

It was Shari. 



25 


“Shari—is it really you?” Greg shouted into the phone. 

“Yeah. It’s me!” She sounded as surprised as he did. 

“But how? I mean—” His mind was racing. He didn’t know what to say. 

“Your guess is as good as mine,” Shari told him. And then she said, “Hold 
on a minute.” And he heard her step away from the phone to talk to her mother. 
“Mom—stop crying already. Mom—it’s really me. I’m home.” 

A few seconds later, she came back on the line. “I’ve been home for two 
hours, and Mom’s still crying and carrying on.” 

“I feel like crying, too,” Greg admitted. “I—I just can’t believe it! Shari, 
where were you?” 

The line was silent for a long moment. “I don’t know,” she answered 
finally. 

“Huh?” 

“I really don’t. It was just so weird, Greg. One minute, there I was at my 
birthday party. The next minute, I was standing in front of my house. And it was 
two days later. But I don’t remember being away. Or being anywhere else. I 
don’t remember anything at all.” 

“You don’t remember going away? Or coming back?” Greg asked. 

“No. Nothing,” Shari said, her voice trembling. 

“Shari, those pictures I took of you—remember? With the weird camera? 
You were invisible in them—” 

“And then I disappeared,” she said, finishing his thought. 

“Shari, do you think—?” 

“I don’t know,” she replied quickly. “I—I have to get off now. The police 
are here. They want to question me. What am I going to tell them? They’re 
going to think I had amnesia or flipped out or something.” 

“I—I don’t know,” Greg said, completely bewildered. “We have to talk. 
The camera—” 

“I can’t now,” she told him. “Maybe tomorrow. Okay?” She called to her 
mother that she was coming. “Bye, Greg. See you.” And then she hung up. 

Greg replaced the receiver but sat on the edge of his bed staring at the 
phone for a long time. 



Shari was back. 

She’d been back about two hours. 

Two hours. Two hours. Two hours. 

He turned his eyes to the clock radio beside the phone. 

Just two hours before, he had ripped up the two snapshots of an invisible 
Shari. 

His mind whirred with wild ideas, insane ideas. 

Had he brought Shari back by ripping up the photos? 

Did this mean that the camera caused her to disappear? That the camera 
caused all of the terrible things that showed up in its snapshots? 

Greg stared at the phone for a long time, thinking hard. 

He knew what he had to do. He had to talk to Shari. And he had to return 
the camera. 

He met Shari on the playground the next afternoon. The sun floated high in a 
cloudless sky. Eight or nine kids were engaged in a noisy brawl of a soccer 
game, running one way, then the other across the outfield of the baseball 
diamond. 

“Hey—you look like youl” Greg exclaimed as Shari came jogging up to 
where he stood beside the bleachers. He pinched her arm. “Yeah. It’s you, okay.” 

She didn’t smile. “I feel fine,” she told him, rubbing her arm. “Just 
confused. And tired. The police asked me questions for hours. And when they 
finally went away, my parents started in.” 

“Sorry,” Greg said quietly, staring down at his sneakers. 

“I think Mom and Dad believe somehow it’s my fault that I disappeared,” 
Shari said, resting her back against the side of the bleachers, shaking her head. 

“It’s the camera’s fault,” Greg muttered. He raised his eyes to hers. “The 
camera is evil.” 

Shari shrugged. “Maybe. I don’t know what to think. I really don’t.” 

He showed her the snapshot, the one showing the two of them on the 
playground staring in horror as a shadow crept over them. 

“How weird,” Shari exclaimed, studying it hard. 

“I want to take the camera back to the Coffman house,” Greg said heatedly. 
“I can go home and get it now. Will you help me? Will you come with me?” 

Shari started to reply but stopped. 

They both saw the dark shadow move, sliding toward them quickly, silently, 



over the grass. 

And then they saw the man dressed all in black, his spindly legs pumping 
hard as he came at them. 

Spidey! 

Greg grabbed Shari’s hand, frozen in fear. 

He and Shari gaped in terror as Spidey’s slithering shadow crept over them. 



26 


Greg had a shudder of recognition. He knew the snapshot had just come true. 

As the dark figure of Spidey moved toward them like a black tarantula, 
Greg pulled Shari’s hand. “Run!” he cried in a shrill voice he didn’t recognize. 

He didn’t have to say it. They were both running now, gasping as they ran 
across the grass toward the street. Their sneakers thudded loudly on the ground 
as they reached the sidewalk and kept running. 

Greg turned to see Spidey closing the gap. “He’s catching up!” he managed 
to cry to Shari, who was a few steps ahead of him. 

Spidey, his face still hidden in the shadows of his black baseball cap, 
moved with startling speed, his long legs kicking high as he pursued them. 

“He’s going to catch us!” Greg cried, feeling as if his chest were about to 
burst. “He’s... too... fast!” 

Spidey moved even closer, his shadow scuttling over the grass. 

Closer. 

When the car horn honked, Greg screamed. 

He and Shari stopped short. 

The horn blasted out again. 

Greg turned to see a familiar young man inside a small hatchback. It was 
Jerry Norman, who lived across the street. Jerry lowered his car window. “Is this 
man chasing you?” he asked excitedly. Without waiting for an answer, he backed 
the car toward Spidey. “I’m calling the cops, mister!” 

Spidey didn’t reply. Instead, he turned and darted across the street. 

“I’m warning you—” Jerry called after him. 

But Spidey had disappeared behind a tall hedge. 

“Are you kids okay?” Greg’s neighbor demanded. 

“Yeah. Fine,” Greg managed to reply, still breathing hard, his chest heaving. 

“We’re okay. Thanks, Jerry,” Shari said. 

“I’ve seen that guy around the neighborhood,” the young man said, staring 
through the windshield at the tall hedge. “Never thought he was dangerous. You 
kids want me to call the police?” 

“No. It’s okay,” Greg replied. 



As soon as I give him back his camera, he’ll stop chasing us, Greg thought. 

“Well, be careful—okay?” Jerry said. “You need a lift home or anything?” 
He studied their faces as if trying to determine how frightened and upset they 
were. 

Greg and Shari both shook their heads. “We’ll be okay,” Greg said. 
“Thanks.” 

Jerry warned them once again to be careful, then drove off, his tires 
squealing as he turned the corner. 

“That was close,” Shari said, her eyes on the hedge. “Why was Spidey 
chasing us?” 

“He thought I had the camera. He wants it back,” Greg told her. “Meet me 
tomorrow, okay? In front of the Coffman house. Help me put it back?” 

Shari stared at him without replying, her expression thoughtful, wary. 

“We’re going to be in danger—all of us—until we put that camera back,” 
Greg insisted. 

“Okay,” Shari said quietly. “Tomorrow.” 



27 


Something scurried through the tall weeds of the unmowed front lawn. “What 
was that?” Shari cried, whispering even though no one else was in sight. “It was 
too big to be a squirrel.” 

She lingered behind Greg, who stopped to look up at the Coffman house. 
“Maybe it was a raccoon or something,” Greg told her. He gripped the camera 
tightly in both hands. 

It was a little after three o’clock the next afternoon, a hazy, overcast day. 
Mountains of dark clouds threatening rain were rolling across the sky, stretching 
behind the house, casting it in shadow. 

“It’s going to storm,” Shari said, staying close behind Greg. “Let’s get this 
over with and go home.” 

“Good idea,” he said, glancing up at the heavy sky. 

Thunder rumbled in the distance, a low roar. 

The old trees that dotted the front yard whispered and shook. 

“We can’t just run inside,” Greg told her, watching the sky darken. “First 
we have to make sure Spidey isn’t there.” 

Making their way quickly through the tall grass and weeds, they stopped at 
the living room window and peered in. Thunder rumbled, low and long, in the 
distance. Greg thought he saw another creature scuttle through the weeds around 
the corner of the house. 

“It’s too dark in there. I can’t see a thing,” Shari complained. 

“Let’s check out the basement,” Greg suggested. “That’s where Spidey 
hangs out, remember?” 

The sky darkened to an eerie gray-green as they made their way to the back 
of the house and dropped to their knees to peer down through the basement 
windows at ground level. 

Squinting through the dust-covered window-panes, they could see the 
makeshift plywood table, the wardrobe against the wall, its doors still open, the 
colorful old clothing spilling out, the empty frozen food boxes scattered on the 
floor. 

“No sign of him,” Greg whispered, cradling the camera in his arm as if it 
might try to escape from him if he didn’t hold it tightly. “Let’s get moving.” 



“Are—are you sure?” Shari stammered. She wanted to be brave. But the 
thought that she had disappeared for two days—completely vanished, most 
likely because of the camera—that frightening thought lingered in her mind. 

Michael and Bird were chicken, she thought. But maybe they were the smart 

ones. 

She wished this were over. All over. 

A few seconds later, Greg and Shari pushed open the front door. They 
stepped into the darkness of the front hall. And stopped. 

And listened. 

And then they both jumped at the sound of the loud, sudden crash directly 
behind them. 



28 


Shari was the first to regain her voice. “It’s just the door!” she cried. “The wind 

55 

A gust of wind had made the front door slam. 

“Let’s get this over with,” Greg whispered, badly shaken. 

“We never should’ve broken into this house in the first place,” Shari 
whispered as they made their way on tiptoe, step by creaking step, down the dark 
hallway toward the basement stairs. 

“It’s a little late for that,” Greg replied sharply. 

Pulling open the door to the basement steps, he stopped again. “What’s that 
banging sound upstairs?” 

Shari’s features tightened in fear as she heard it, too, a repeated, almost 
rhythmic banging. 

“Shutters?” Greg suggested. 

“Yeah,” she quickly agreed, breathing a sigh of relief. “A lot of the shutters 
are loose, remember?” 

The entire house seemed to groan. 

Thunder rumbled outside, closer now. 

They stepped onto the landing, then waited for their eyes to adjust to the 
darkness. 

“Couldn’t we just leave the camera up here and run?” Shari asked, more of 
a plea than a question. 

“No. I want to put it back,” Greg insisted. 

“But, Greg—” She tugged at his arm as he started down the stairs. 

“No!” He pulled out of her grasp. “He was in my room, Shari! He tore 
everything apart, looking for it. I want him to find it where it belongs. If he 
doesn’t find it, he’ll come back to my house. I know he will!” 

“Okay, okay. Let’s just hurry.” 

It was brighter in the basement, gray light seeping down from the four 
ground-level windows. Outside, the wind swirled and pushed against the 
windowpanes. A pale flash of lightning made shadows flicker against the 
basement wall. The old house groaned as if unhappy about the storm. 

“What was that ? Footsteps?” Shari stopped halfway across the basement 



and listened. 

“It’s just the house,” Greg insisted. But his quavering voice revealed that he 
was as frightened as his companion, and he stopped to listen, too. 

Bang. Bang. Bang. 

The shutter high above them continued its rhythmic pounding. 

“Where did you find the camera, anyway?” Shari whispered, following 
Greg to the far wall across from the enormous furnace with its cobwebbed ducts 
sprouting up like pale tree limbs. 

“Over here,” Greg told her. He stepped up to the worktable and reached for 
the vise clamped on the edge. “When I turned the vise, a door opened up. Some 
kind of hidden shelf. That’s where the camera—” 

He cranked the handle of the vise. 

Once again, the door to the secret shelf popped open. 

“Good,” he whispered excitedly. He flashed Shari a smile. 

He shoved the camera onto the shelf, tucking the carrying strap under it. 
Then he pushed the door closed. “We’re out of here.” 

He felt so much better. So relieved. So much lighter. 

The house groaned and creaked. Greg didn’t care. 

Another flash of lightning, brighter this time, like a camera flash, sent 
shadows flickering on the wall. 

“Come on,” he whispered. But Shari was already ahead of him, making her 
way carefully over the food cartons strewn everywhere, hurrying toward the 
steps. 

They were halfway up the stairs, Greg one step behind Shari, when, above 
them, Spidey stepped silently into view on the landing, blocking their escape.

Greg blinked and shook his head, as if he could shake away the image of the 
figure that stared darkly down at him. 

“No!” Shari cried out, and fell back against Greg. 

He grabbed for the railing, forgetting that it had fallen under Michael’s 
weight during their first unfortunate visit to the house. Luckily, Shari regained 
her balance before toppling them both down the stairs. 

Lightning flashed behind them, sending a flash of white light across the 
stairway. But the unmoving figure on the landing above them remained shrouded 
in darkness. 

“Let us go!” Greg finally managed to cry, finding his voice. 

“Yeah. We returned your camera!” Shari added, sounding shrill and 
frightened. 

Spidey didn’t reply. Instead, he took a step toward them, onto the first step. 
And then he descended another step. 

Nearly stumbling again, Greg and Shari backed down to the basement floor. 

The wooden stairs squeaked in protest as the dark figure stepped slowly, 
steadily, down. As he reached the basement floor, a crackling bolt of lightning 
cast a blue light over him, and Greg and Shari saw his face for the first time. 

In the brief flash of color, they saw that he was old, older than they had 
imagined. That his eyes were small and round like dark marbles. That his mouth 
was small, too, pursed in a tight, menacing grimace. 

“We returned the camera,” Shari said, staring in fear as Spidey crept closer. 
“Can’t we go now? Please?” 

“Let me see,” Spidey said. His voice was younger than his face, warmer 
than his eyes. “Come.” 

They hesitated. But he gave them no choice. 

Ushering them back across the cluttered floor to the worktable, he wrapped 
his large, spidery hand over the vise and turned the handle. The door opened. He 
pulled out the camera and held it close to his face to examine it. 

“You shouldn’t have taken it,” he told them, speaking softly, turning the 
camera in his hands. 

“We’re sorry,” Shari said quickly. 



“Can we go now?” Greg asked, edging toward the stairs. 

“It’s not an ordinary camera,” Spidey said, raising his small eyes to them. 

“We know,” Greg blurted out. “The pictures it took. They—” 

Spidey’s eyes grew wide, his expression angry. “You took pictures with it?” 

“Just a few,” Greg told him, wishing he had kept his mouth shut. “They 
didn’t come out. Really.” 

“You know about the camera, then,” Spidey said, moving quickly to the 
center of the floor. 

Was he trying to block their escape? Greg wondered. 

“It’s broken or something,” Greg said uncertainly, shoving his hands into 
his jeans pockets. 

“It’s not broken,” the tall, dark figure said softly. “It’s evil.” He motioned 
toward the low plywood table. “Sit there.” 

Shari and Greg exchanged glances. Then, reluctantly, they sat down on the 
edge of the board, sitting stiffly, nervously, their eyes darting toward the 
stairway, toward escape. 

“The camera is evil,” Spidey repeated, standing over them, holding the 
camera in both hands. “I should know. I helped to create it.” 

“You’re an inventor?” Greg asked, glancing at Shari, who was nervously 
tugging at a strand of her black hair. 

“I’m a scientist,” Spidey replied. “Or, I should say, I was a scientist. My 
name is Fredericks. Dr. Fritz Fredericks.” He transferred the camera from one 
hand to the other. “My lab partner invented this camera. It was his pride and joy. 
More than that, it would have made him a fortune. Would have, I say.” He 
paused, a thoughtful expression sinking over his face. 

“What happened to him? Did he die?” Shari asked, still fiddling with the 
strand of hair. 

Dr. Fredericks snickered. “No. Worse. I stole the invention from him. I stole 
the plans and the camera. I was evil, you see. I was young and greedy. So very 
greedy. And I wasn’t above stealing to make my fortune.” 

He paused, eyeing them both as if waiting for them to say something, to 
offer their disapproval of him, perhaps. But when Greg and Shari remained 
silent, staring up at him from the low plywood table, he continued his story. 

“When I stole the camera, it caught my partner by surprise. Unfortunately, 
from then on, all of the surprises were mine.” A strange, sad smile twisted across 
his aged face. “My partner, you see, was much more evil than I was.” 



Dr. Fredericks coughed into his hand, then began to pace in front of Greg 
and Shari as he talked, speaking softly, slowly, as if remembering the story for 
the first time in a long while. 

“My partner was a true evil one. He dabbled in the dark arts. I should 
correct myself. He didn’t just dabble. He was quite a master of it all.” 

He held up the camera, waving it above his head, then lowering it. “My 
partner put a curse on the camera. If he couldn’t profit from it, he wanted to 
make sure that I never would, either. And so he put a curse on it.” 

He turned his gaze on Greg, leaning over him. “Do you know about how 
some primitive peoples fear the camera? They fear the camera because they 
believe that if it takes their picture, it will steal their soul.” He patted the camera. 
“Well, this camera really does steal souls.” 

Staring up at the camera, Greg shuddered. 

The camera had stolen Shari away. 

Would it have stolen all of their souls? 

“People have died because of this camera,” Dr. Fredericks said, uttering a 
slow, sad sigh. “People close to me. That is how I came to learn of the curse, to 
learn of the camera’s evil. And then I learned something just as frightening—the 
camera cannot be destroyed.” 

He coughed, cleared his throat noisily, and began to pace in front of them 
again. “And so I vowed to keep the camera a secret. To keep it away from people 
so it cannot do its evil. I lost my job. My family. I lost everything because of it. 
But I am determined to keep the camera where it can do no harm.” 

He stopped pacing, with his back toward them. He stood silently, shoulders 
hunched, lost in thought. 

Greg quickly climbed to his feet and motioned for Shari to do the same. 
“Well... uh... I guess it’s good we returned it,” he said hesitantly. “Sorry we 
caused so much trouble.” 

“Yeah, we’re very sorry,” Shari repeated sincerely. “Guess it’s back in the 
right hands.” 

“Good-bye,” Greg said, starting toward the steps. “It’s getting late, and we 

“No!” Dr. Fredericks shouted, startling them both. He moved quickly to 
block the way. “I’m afraid you can’t go. You know too much.”

“I can never let you leave,” Dr. Fredericks said, his face flickering in the blue 
glow of a lightning flash. He crossed his bony arms in front of his black 
sweatshirt. 

“But we won’t tell anyone,” Greg said, his voice rising until the words 
became a plea. “Really.” 

“Your secret is good with us,” Shari insisted, her frightened eyes on Greg. 

Dr. Fredericks stared at them menacingly but didn’t reply. 

“You can trust us,” Greg said, his voice quavering. He cast a frightened 
glance at Shari. 

“Besides,” Shari said, “even if we did tell anyone, who would believe us?” 

“Enough talk,” Dr. Fredericks snapped. “It won’t do you any good. I’ve 
worked too long and too hard to keep the camera a secret.” 

A rush of wind pushed against the windows, sending up a low howl. The 
wind carried a drumroll of rain. The sky through the basement windows was as 
black as night. 

“You—can’t keep us here forever!” Shari cried, unable to keep the growing 
terror from her voice. 

The rain pounded against the windows now, a steady downpour. 

Dr. Fredericks drew himself up straight, seemed to grow taller. His tiny 
eyes burned into Shari’s. “I’m so sorry,” he said, his voice a whisper of regret. 
“So sorry. But I have no choice.” 

He took another step toward them. 

Greg and Shari exchanged frightened glances. From where they stood, in 
front of the low plywood table in the center of the basement, the steps seemed a 
hundred miles away. 

“Wh-what are you going to do?” Greg cried, shouting over a burst of 
thunder that rattled the basement windows. 

“Please!” Shari begged. “Don’t!” 

Dr. Fredericks moved forward with surprising speed. Holding the camera in 
one hand, he grabbed Greg’s shoulder with the other. 

“No!” Greg screamed. “Let go!” 

“Let go of him!” Shari screamed. 



She suddenly realized that both of Dr. Fredericks’ hands were occupied. 

This may be my only chance, she thought. 

She took a deep breath and lunged forward. 

Dr. Fredericks’ eyes bulged, and he cried out in surprise as Shari grabbed 
the camera with both hands and pulled it away from him. He made a frantic grab 
for the camera, and Greg burst free. 

Before the desperate man could take another step, Shari raised the camera 
to her eye and pointed the lens at him. 

“Please—no! Don’t push the button!” the old man cried. 

He lurched forward, his eyes wild, and grabbed the camera with both hands. 

Greg stared in horror as Shari and Dr. Fredericks grappled, both holding on 
to the camera, each trying desperately to wrestle it away from the other. 

FLASH! 

The bright burst of light startled them all. 

Shari grabbed the camera. “Run!” she screamed. 



31 


The basement became a whirring blur of grays and blacks as Greg hurtled 
himself toward the stairs. 

He and Shari ran side by side, slipping over the food cartons, jumping over 
tin cans and empty bottles. 

Rain thundered against the windows. The wind howled, pushing against the 
glass. They could hear Dr. Fredericks’ anguished screams behind them. 

“Did it take our picture or his?” Shari asked. 

“I don’t know. Just hurryl” Greg screamed. 

The old man was howling like a wounded animal, his cries competing with 
the rain and wind pushing at the windows. 

The stairs weren’t that far away. But it seemed to take forever to reach 
them. 

Forever. 

Forever, Greg thought. Dr. Fredericks wanted to keep Shari and me down 
there forever. 

Panting loudly, they both reached the dark stairway. A deafening clap of 
thunder made them stop and turn around. 

“Huh?” Greg cried aloud. 

To his shock, Dr. Fredericks hadn’t chased after them. 

And his anguished cries had stopped. 

The basement was silent. 

“What’s going on?” Shari cried breathlessly. 

Squinting back into the darkness, it took Greg a while to realize that the 
dark, rumpled form lying on the floor in front of the worktable was Dr. 
Fredericks. 

“What happened?” Shari cried, her chest heaving as she struggled to catch 
her breath. Still clinging to the camera strap, she gaped in surprise at the old 
man’s still body, sprawled on its back on the floor. 

“I don’t know,” Greg replied in a breathless whisper. 

Reluctantly, Greg started back toward Dr. Fredericks. Following close 
behind, Shari uttered a low cry of horror when she clearly saw the fallen man’s 
face. 



Eyes bulged out, the mouth open in a twisted O of terror, the face stared up 
at them. Frozen. Dead. 

Dr. Fredericks was dead. 

“What— happened ?” Shari finally managed to say, swallowing hard, 
forcing herself to turn away from the ghastly, tortured face. 

“I think he died of fright,” Greg replied, squeezing her shoulder and not 
even realizing it. 

“Huh? Fright?” 

“He knew better than anyone what the camera could do,” Greg said. “When 
you snapped his picture, I think... I think it scared him to death]” 

“I only wanted to throw him off guard,” Shari cried. “I only wanted to give 
us a chance to escape. I didn’t think—” 

“The picture,” Greg interrupted. “Fet’s see the picture.” 

Shari raised the camera. The photo was still half inside the camera. Greg 
pulled it out with a trembling hand. He held it up so they could both see it. 

“Wow,” he exclaimed quietly. “Wow.” 

The photo showed Dr. Fredericks lying on the floor, his eyes bulging, his 
mouth frozen open in horror. 

Dr. Fredericks’ fright, Greg realized—the fright that had killed him—was 
there, frozen on film, frozen on his face. 

The camera had claimed another victim. This time forever. 

“What do we do now?” Shari asked, staring down at the figure sprawled at 
their feet. 

“First, I’m putting this camera back,” Greg said, taking it from her and 
shoving it back on its shelf. He turned the vise handle, and the door to the secret 
compartment closed. 

Greg breathed a sigh of relief. Hiding the dreadful camera away made him 
feel so much better. 

“Now, let’s go home and call the police,” he said. 

Two days later, a cool, bright day with a gentle breeze rustling the trees, the four 
friends stopped at the curb, leaning on their bikes, and stared up at the Coffman 
house. Even in bright sunlight, the old trees that surrounded the house covered it 
in shade. 

“So you didn’t tell the police about the camera?” Bird asked, staring up at 
the dark, empty front window. 



“No. They wouldn’t believe it,” Greg told him. “Besides, the camera should 
stay locked up forever. Forever! I hope no one ever finds out about it.” 

“We told the police we ran into the house to get out of the rain,” Shari 
added. “And we said we started to explore while we waited for the storm to blow 
over. And we found the body in the basement.” 

“What did Spidey die of?” Michael asked, gazing up at the house. 

“The police said it was heart failure,” Greg told him. “But we know the 
truth.” 

“Wow. I can’t believe one old camera could do so much evil,” Bird said. 

“I believe it,” Greg said quietly. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Michael urged. He raised his sneakers to the pedals 
and started to roll away. “This place really creeps me out.” 

The other three followed, pedaling away in thoughtful silence. 

They had turned the corner and were heading up the next block when two 
figures emerged from the back door of the Coffman house. Joey Ferris and 
Mickey Ward stepped over the weed-choked lawn onto the driveway. 

“Those jerks aren’t too bright,” Joey told his companion. “They never even 
saw us the other day. Never saw us watching them through the basement 
window.” 

Mickey laughed. “Yeah. They’re jerks.” 

“They couldn’t hide this camera from us. No way, man,” Joey said. He 
raised the camera and examined it. 

“Take my picture,” Mickey demanded. “Come on. Let’s try it out.” 

“Yeah. Okay.” Joey raised the viewfinder to his eye. “Say cheese.” 

A click. A flash. A whirring sound. 

Joey pulled the snapshot from the camera, and both boys eagerly huddled 
around it, waiting to see what developed. 





LET'S GET INVISIBLE! 


Goosebumps - 06 
R.L. Stine 



1 


I went invisible for the first time on my twelfth birthday. 

It was all Whitey’s fault, in a way. Whitey is my dog. He’s just a mutt, part 
terrier, part everything else. He’s all black, so of course we named him Whitey. 

If Whitey hadn’t been sniffing around in the attic... 

Well, maybe I’d better back up a bit and start at the beginning. 

My birthday was on a rainy Saturday. It was a few minutes before kids 
would start arriving for my birthday party, so I was getting ready. 

Getting ready means brushing my hair. 

My brother is always on my case about my hair. He gives me a hard time 
because I spend so much time in front of the mirror brushing it and checking it 
out. 

The thing is, I just happen to have great hair. It’s very thick and sort of a 
golden brown, and just a little bit wavy. My hair is my best feature, so I like to 
make sure it looks okay. 

Also, I have very big ears. They stick out a lot. So I have to keep making 
sure that my hair covers my ears. It’s important. 

“Max, it’s messed up in back,” my brother, Lefty, said, standing behind me 
as I studied my hair in the front hall mirror. 

His name is really Noah, but I call him Lefty because he’s the only left- 
handed person in our family. Lefty was tossing a softball up and catching it in 
his left hand. He knew he wasn’t supposed to toss that softball around in the 
house, but he always did it anyway. 

Lefty is two years younger than me. He’s not a bad guy, but he has too 
much energy. He always has to be tossing a ball around, drumming his hands on 
the table, hitting something, running around, falling down, leaping into things, 
wrestling with me. You get the idea. Dad says that Lefty has ants in his pants. 
It’s a dumb expression, but it sort of describes my brother. 

I turned and twisted my neck to see the back of my hair. “It is not messed 
up, liar,” I said. 

“Think fast!” Lefty shouted, and he tossed the softball at me. 

I made a grab for it and missed. It hit the wall just below the mirror with a 
loud thud. Lefty and I held our breath, waiting to see if Mom heard the sound. 



But she didn’t. I think she was in the kitchen doing something to the birthday 
cake. 

“That was dumb,” I whispered to Lefty. “You almost broke the mirror.” 

“You’re dumb,” he said. Typical. 

“Why don’t you learn to throw right-handed? Then maybe I could catch it 
sometimes,” I told him. I liked to tease him about being left-handed because he 
really hated it. 

“You stink,” he said, picking up the softball. 

I was used to it. He said it a hundred times a day. I guess he thought it was 
clever or something. 

He’s a good kid for a ten-year-old, but he doesn’t have much of a 
vocabulary. 

“Your ears are sticking out,” he said. 

I knew he was lying. I started to answer him, but the doorbell rang. 

He and I raced down the narrow hallway to the front door. “Hey, it’s my 
party!” I told him. 

But Lefty got to the door first and pulled it open. 

My best friend, Zack, pulled open the screen door and hurried into the 
house. It was starting to rain pretty hard, and he was already soaked. 

He handed me a present, wrapped in silver paper, raindrops dripping off it. 
“It’s a bunch of comic books,” he said. “I already read ’em. The X-Force graphic 
novel is kind of cool.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “They don’t look too wet.” 

Lefty grabbed the present from my hand and ran into the living room with 
it. “Don’t open it!” I shouted. He said he was just starting a pile. 

Zack took off his Red Sox cap, and I got a look at his new haircut. “Wow! 
You look... different,” I said, studying his new look. His black hair was buzzed 
real short on the left side. The rest of it was long, brushed straight to the right. 

“Did you invite girls?” he asked me, “or is it just boys?” 

“Some girls are coming,” I told him. “Erin and April. Maybe my cousin 
Debra.” I knew he liked Debra. 

He nodded thoughtfully. Zack has a real serious face. He has these little 
blue eyes that always look far away, like he’s thinking hard about something. 
Like he’s real deep. 

He’s sort of an intense guy. Not nervous. Just keyed up. And very 
competitive. He has to win at everything. If he comes in second place, he gets 



really upset and kicks the furniture. You know the kind. 

“What are we going to do?” Zack asked, shaking the water off his Red Sox 

cap. 

I shrugged. “We were supposed to be in the back yard. Dad put the 
volleyball net up this morning. But that was before it started to rain. I rented 
some movies. Maybe we’ll watch them.” 

The doorbell rang. Lefty appeared again from out of nowhere, pushed Zack 
and me out of the way, and made a dive for the door. “Oh, it’s you,” I heard him 
say. 

“Thanks for the welcome.” I recognized Erin’s squeaky voice. Some kids 
call Erin “Mouse” because of that voice, and because she’s tiny like a mouse. 
She has short, straight blonde hair, and I think she’s cute, but of course I’d never 
tell anyone that. 

“Can we come in?” I recognized April’s voice next. April is the other girl in 
our group. She has curly black hair and dark, sad eyes. I always thought she was 
really sad, but then I figured out that she’s just shy. 

“The party’s tomorrow,” I heard Lefty tell them. 

“Huh?” Both girls uttered cries of surprise. 

“No, it isn’t,” I shouted. I stepped into the doorway and shoved Lefty out of 
the way. I pushed open the screen door so Erin and April could come in. “You 
know Lefty’s little jokes,” I said, squeezing my brother against the wall. 

“Lefty is a little joke,” Erin said. 

“You’re stupid,” Lefty told her. I pressed him into the wall a little harder, 
leaning against him with all my weight. But he ducked down and scooted away. 

“Happy Birthday,” April said, shaking the rain from her curly hair. She 
handed me a present, wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper. “It’s the only paper 
we had,” she explained, seeing me staring at it. 

“Merry Christmas to you, too,” I joked. The present felt like a CD. 

“I forgot your present,” Erin said. 

“What is it?” I asked, following the girls into the living room. 

“I don’t know. I haven’t bought it yet.” 

Lefty grabbed April’s present out of my hand and ran to put it on top of 
Zack’s present in the corner behind the couch. 

Erin plopped down on the white leather ottoman in front of the armchair. 
April stood at the window, staring out at the rain. 

“We were going to barbecue hot dogs,” I said. 



“They’d be pretty soggy today,” April replied. 

Lefty stood behind the couch, tossing his softball up and catching it one- 
handed. 

“You’re going to break that lamp,” I warned him. 

He ignored me, of course. 

“Who else is coming?” Erin asked. 

Before I could answer, the doorbell rang again. Lefty and I raced to the 
door. He tripped over his own sneakers and went skidding down the hall on his 
stomach. So typical. 

By two-thirty everyone had arrived, fifteen kids in all, and the party got 
started. Well, it didn’t really get started because we couldn’t decide what to do. I 
wanted to watch the Terminator movie I’d rented. But the girls wanted to play 
Twister. 

“It’s my birthday!” I insisted. 

We compromised. We played Twister. Then we watched some of the 
Terminator video until it was time to eat. 

It was a pretty good party. I think everyone had an okay time. Even April 
seemed to be having fun. She was usually really quiet and nervous-looking at 
parties. 

Lefty spilled his Coke and ate his slice of chocolate birthday cake with his 
hands because he thought it was funny. But he was the only animal in the group. 

I told him the only reason he was invited was because he was in the family 
and there was nowhere else we could stash him. He replied by opening his 
mouth up real wide so everyone could see his chewed-up chocolate cake inside. 

After I opened presents, I put the Terminator movie back on. But everyone 
started to leave. I guess it was about five o’clock. It looked much later. It was 
dark as night out, still storming. 

My parents were in the kitchen cleaning up. Erin and April were the only 
ones left. Erin’s mother was supposed to pick them up. She called and said she’d 
be a little late. 

Whitey was standing at the living room window, barking his head off. I 
looked outside. I didn’t see anyone there. I grabbed him with both hands and 
wrestled him away from the window. 

“Let’s go up to my room,” I suggested when I finally got the dumb dog 
quiet. “I got a new Super Nintendo game I want to try.” 

Erin and April gladly followed me upstairs. They didn’t like the Terminator 



movie, for some reason. 

The upstairs hallway was pitch black. I clicked the light switch, but the 
overhead light didn’t come on. “The bulb must be burned out,” I said. 

My room was at the end of the hall. We made our way slowly through the 
darkness. 

“It’s kind of spooky up here,” April said quietly. 

And just as she said it, the linen closet door swung open and, with a 
deafening howl, a dark figure leapt out at us. 



2 


As the girls cried out in horror, the howling creature grabbed me around the 
waist and wrestled me to the floor. 

“Lefty —let go!” I screamed angrily. “You’re not funny!” 

He was laughing like a lunatic. He thought he was a riot. “Gotcha!” he 
cried. “I gotcha good!” 

“We weren’t scared,” Erin insisted. “We knew it was you.” 

“Then why’d you scream?” Lefty asked. 

Erin didn’t have an answer. 

I shoved him off me and climbed to my feet. “That was dumb, Lefty.” 

“How long were you waiting in the linen closet?” April asked. 

“A long time,” Lefty told her. He started to get up, but Whitey ran up to him 
and began furiously licking his face. It tickled so much, Lefty fell onto his back, 
laughing. 

“You scared Whitey, too,” I said. 

“No, I didn’t. Whitey’s smarter than you guys.” Lefty pushed Whitey away. 

Whitey began sniffing at the door across the hall. 

“Where does that door lead, Max?” Erin asked. 

“To the attic,” I told her. 

“You have an attic?” Erin cried. Like it was some kind of big deal. “What’s 
up there? I love attics!” 

“Huh?” I squinted at her in the dark. Sometimes girls are really weird. I 
mean, how could anyone love attics? 

“Just a lot of old junk my grandparents left,” I told her. “This house used to 
be theirs. Mom and Dad stored a lot of their stuff in the attic. We hardly ever go 
up there.” 

“Can we go up and take a look?” Erin asked. 

“I guess,” I said. “I don’t think it’s too big a thrill or anything.” 

“I love old junk,” Erin said. 

“But it’s so dark....” April said softly. I think she was a little scared. 

I opened the door and reached for the light switch just inside. A ceiling light 
clicked on in the attic. It cast a pale yellow light down at us as we stared up the 



steep wooden stairs. 

“See? There’s light up there,” I told April. I started up the stairs. They 
creaked under my sneakers. My shadow was really long. “You coming?” 

“Erin’s mom will be here any minute,” April said. 

“We’ll just go up for a second,” Erin said. She gave April a gentle push. 
“Come on.” 

Whitey trotted past us as we climbed the stairs, his tail wagging excitedly, 
his toenails clicking loudly on the wooden steps. About halfway up, the air grew 
hot and dry. 

I stopped on the top step and looked around. The attic stretched on both 
sides. It was one long room, filled with old furniture, cardboard cartons, old 
clothes, fishing rods, stacks of yellowed magazines—all kinds of junk. 

“Ooh, it smells so musty,” Erin said, moving past me and taking a few steps 
into the vast space. She took a deep breath. “I love that smell!” 

“You’re definitely weird,” I told her. 

Rain drummed loudly against the roof. The sound echoed through the low 
room, a steady roar. It sounded as if we were inside a waterfall. 

All four of us began walking around, exploring. Lefty kept tossing his 
softball up against the ceiling rafters, then catching it as it came down. I noticed 
that April stayed close to Erin. Whitey was sniffing furiously along the wall. 

“Think there are mice up here?” Lefty asked, a devilish grin crossing his 
face. I saw April’s eyes go wide. “Big fat mice who like to climb up girls’ legs?” 
Lefty teased. 

My kid brother has a great sense of humor. 

“Could we go now?” April asked impatiently. She started back toward the 
stairway. 

“Look at these old magazines,” Erin exclaimed, ignoring her. She picked 
one up and started flipping through it. “Check this out. The clothes these models 
are wearing are a riot!” 

“Hey—what’s Whitey doing?” Lefty asked suddenly. 

I followed his gaze to the far wall. Behind a tall stack of cartons, I could see 
Whitey’s tail wagging. And I could hear him scratching furiously at something. 

“Whitey—come!” I commanded. 

Of course he ignored me. He began scratching harder. 

“Whitey, what are you scratching at?” 

“Probably pulling a mouse apart,” Lefty suggested. 



“I’m outta here!” April exclaimed. 

“Whitey?” I called. Stepping around an old dining room table, I made my 
way across the cluttered attic. I quickly saw that he was scratching at the bottom 
of a door. 

“Hey, look,” I called to the others. “Whitey found a hidden door.” 

“Cool!” Erin cried, hurrying over. Lefty and April were right behind. 

“I didn’t know this was up here,” I said. 

“We’ve got to check it out,” Erin urged. “Let’s see what’s on the other 
side.” 

And that’s when the trouble all began. 

You can understand why I say it was all Whitey’s fault, right? If that dumb 
dog hadn’t started sniffing and scratching there, we might never have found the 
hidden attic room. 

And we never would have discovered the exciting—and frightening—secret 
behind that wooden door.

“Whitey!” I knelt down and pulled the dog away from the door. “What’s your 
problem, doggie?” 

As soon as I moved him aside, Whitey lost all interest in the door. He 
trotted off and started sniffing another corner. Talk about your short attention 
span. But I guess that’s the difference between dogs and people. 

The rain continued to pound down, a steady roar just above our heads. I 
could hear the wind whistling around the corner of the house. It was a real spring 
storm. 

The door had a rusted latch about halfway up. It slid off easily, and the 
warped wooden door started to swing open before I even pulled at it. 

The door hinges squeaked as I pulled the door toward me, revealing solid 
darkness on the other side. 

Before I had gotten the door open halfway, Lefty scooted under me and 
darted into the dark room. 

“A dead bodyl” he shrieked. 

“Noooo!” April and Erin both cried out with squeals of terror. 

But I knew Lefty’s dumb sense of humor. “Nice try, Lefty,” I said, and 
followed him through the doorway. 

Of course he was just goofing. 

I found myself in a small, windowless room. The only light came from the 
pale yellow ceiling light behind us in the center of the attic. 

“Push the door all the way open so the light can get in,” I instructed Erin. “I 
can’t see a thing in here.” 

Erin pushed open the door and slid a carton over to hold it in place. Then 
she and April crept in to join Lefty and me. 

“It’s too big to be a closet,” Erin said, her voice sounding even squeakier 
than usual. “So what is it?” 

“Just a room, I guess,” I said, still waiting for my eyes to adjust to the dim 

light. 

I took another step into the room. And as I did, a dark figure stepped toward 
me. 


I screamed and jumped back. 



The other person jumped back, too. 

“It’s a mirror, dork!” Lefty said, and started to laugh. 

Instantly, all four of us were laughing. Nervous, high-pitched laughter. 

It was a mirror in front of us. In the pale yellow light filtering into the 
small, square room, I could see it clearly now. 

It was a big, rectangular mirror, about two feet taller than me, with a dark 
wood frame. It rested on a wooden base. 

I moved closer to it and my reflection moved once again to greet me. To my 
surprise, the reflection was clear. No dust on the glass, despite the fact that no 
one had been in here in ages. 

I stepped in front of it and started to check out my hair. 

I mean, that’s what mirrors are for, right? 

“Who would put a mirror in a room all by itself?” Erin asked. I could see 
her dark reflection in the mirror, a few feet behind me. 

“Maybe it’s a valuable piece of furniture or something,” I said, reaching 
into my jeans pocket for my comb. “You know. An antique.” 

“Did your parents put it up here?” Erin asked. 

“I don’t know,” I replied. “Maybe it belonged to my grandparents. I just 
don’t know.” I ran the comb through my hair a few times. 

“Can we go now? This isn’t too thrilling,” April said. She was still lingering 
reluctantly in the doorway. 

“Maybe it was a carnival mirror,” Lefty said, pushing me out of the way 
and making faces into the mirror, bringing his face just inches from the glass. 
“You know. One of those fun house mirrors that makes your body look like it’s 
shaped like an egg.” 

“You’re already shaped like an egg,” I joked, pushing him aside. “At least, 
your head is.” 

“You’re a rotten egg,” he snapped back. “You stink.” 

I peered into the mirror. I looked perfectly normal, not distorted at all. “Hey, 
April, come in,” I urged. “You’re blocking most of the light.” 

“Can’t we just leave?” she asked, whining. Reluctantly, she moved from the 
doorway, taking a few small steps into the room. “Who cares about an old 
mirror, anyway?” 

“Hey, look,” I said, pointing. I had spotted a light attached to the top of the 
mirror. It was oval-shaped, made of brass or some other kind of metal. The bulb 
was long and narrow, almost like a fluorescent bulb, only shorter. 



I gazed up at it, trying to figure it out in the dim light. “How do you turn it 
on, I wonder.” 

“There’s a chain,” Erin said, coming up beside me. 

Sure enough, a slender chain descended from the right side of the lamp, 
hanging down about a foot from the top of the mirror. 

“Wonder if it works,” I said. 

“The bulb’s probably dead,” Lefty remarked. Good old Lefty. Always an 
optimist. 

“Only one way to find out,” I said. Standing on tiptoes, I stretched my hand 
up to the chain. 

“Be careful,” April warned. 

“Huh? It’s just a light,” I told her. 

Lamous last words. 

I reached up. Missed. Tried again. I grabbed the chain on the second try and 
pulled. 

The light came on with a startlingly bright flash. Then it dimmed down to 
normal light. Very white light that reflected brightly in the mirror. 

“Hey—that’s better!” I exclaimed. “It lights up the whole room. Pretty 
bright, huh?” 

No one said anything. 

“I said, pretty bright, huh?” 

Still silence from my companions. 

I turned around and was surprised to find looks of horror on all three faces. 

“Max?” Lefty cried, staring hard at me, his eyes practically popping out of 
his head. 

“Max—where are you?” Erin cried. She turned to April. “Where’d he go?” 

“I’m right here,” I told them. “I haven’t moved.” 

“But we can’t see you! ” April cried.

All three of them were staring in my direction with their eyes bulging and looks 
of horror still on their faces. But I could tell they were goofing. 

“Give me a break, guys,” I said. “I’m not as stupid as I look. No way I’m 
falling for your dumb joke.” 

“But, Max—” Lefty insisted. “We’re seriousl” 

“We can’t see you!” Erin repeated. 

Dumb, dumb, dumb. 

Suddenly, the light started to hurt my eyes. It seemed to grow brighter. It 
was shining right in my face. 

Shielding my eyes with one hand, I reached up with the other hand and 
pulled the chain. 

The light went out, but the white glare stayed with me. I tried to blink it 
away, but I still saw large bright spots before my eyes. 

“Hey—you’re back!” Lefty cried. He stepped up and grabbed my arm and 
squeezed it, as if he were testing it, making sure I was real or something. 

“What’s your problem?” I snapped. I was starting to get angry. “I didn’t fall 
for your dumb joke, Lefty. So why keep it up?” 

To my surprise, Lefty didn’t back away. He held onto my arm as if he were 
afraid to let go. 

“We weren’t joking, Max,” Erin insisted in a low voice. “We really couldn’t 
see you.” 

“It must have been the light in the mirror,” April said. She was pressed 
against the wall next to the doorway. “It was so bright. I think it was just an 
optical illusion or something.” 

“It wasn’t an optical illusion,” Erin told her. “I was standing right next to 
Max. And I couldn’t see him.” 

“He was invisible,” Lefty added solemnly. 

I laughed. “You guys are trying to scare me,” I said. “And you’re doing a 
pretty good job of it!” 

“You scared us!” Lefty exclaimed. He let go of my arm and stepped up to 
the mirror. 

I followed his gaze. “There I am,” I said, pointing to my reflection. A strand 



of hair was poking up in back of my head. I carefully slicked it down. 

“Let’s get out of here,” April pleaded. 

Lefty started to toss his softball up, studying himself in the mirror. 

Erin made her way around to the back of the mirror. “It’s too dark back 
here. I can’t see anything,” she said. 

She stepped around to the front and stared up at the oval-shaped lamp on 
top. “You disappeared as soon as you pulled the chain on that lamp.” 

“You’re really serious!” I said. For the first time I began to believe they 
weren’t joking. 

“You were invisible, Max,” Erin said. “Poof. You were gone.” 

“She’s right,” Lefty agreed, tossing the softball up and catching it, admiring 
his form in the mirror. 

“It was just an optical illusion,” April insisted. “Why are you guys making 
such a big deal about it?” 

“It wasn’t !” Erin insisted. 

“He clicked on the light. Then he disappeared in a flash,” Lefty said. He 
dropped the softball. It bounced loudly on the hardwood floor, then rolled behind 
the mirror. 

He hesitated for a few seconds. Then he went after it, diving for the ball in 
the darkness. A few seconds later, he came running back. 

“You really were invisible, Max,” he said. 

“Really,” Erin added, staring hard at me. 

“Prove it,” I told them. 

“Let’s go !” April pleaded. She had moved to the doorway and was standing 
half in, half out of the room. 

“What do you mean prove it!” Erin asked, talking to my dark reflection in 
the mirror. 

“Show me,” I said. 

“You mean do what you did?” Erin asked, turning to talk to the real me. 

“Yeah,” I said. “You go invisible, too. Just like I did.” 

Erin and Lefty stared at me. Lefty’s mouth dropped open. 

“This is dumb,” April called from behind us. 

“I’ll do it,” Lefty said. He stepped up to the mirror. 

I pulled him back by the shoulders. “Not you,” I said. “You’re too young.” 

He tried to pull out of my grasp, but I held onto him. “How about you, 
Erin?” I urged, wrapping my arms around Lefty’s waist to keep him back from 



the mirror. 

She shrugged. “Okay. I’ll try, I guess.” 

Lefty stopped struggling to get away. I loosened my grip a little. 

We watched Erin step up in front of the mirror. Her reflection stared back at 
her, dark and shadowy. 

She stood on tiptoes, reached up, and grabbed the lamp chain. She glanced 
over at me and smiled. “Here goes,” she said.

The chain slipped from Erin’s hand. 

She reached up and grabbed it again. 

She was just about to tug at it when a woman’s voice interrupted from 
downstairs. “Erin! Are you up there? April?” 

I recognized the voice. Erin’s mom. 

“Yeah. We’re up here,” Erin shouted. She let go of the chain. 

“Hurry down. We’re late!” her mom called. “What are you doing up in the 
attic, anyway?” 

“Nothing,” Erin called down. She turned to me and shrugged. 

“Good. I’m outta here!” April exclaimed, and hurried to the stairway. 

We all followed her down, clumping noisily down the creaking wooden 
stairs. 

“What were you doing up there?” my mom asked when we were all in the 
living room. “It’s so dusty in that attic. It’s a wonder you’re not filthy.” 

“We were just hanging out,” I told her. 

“We were playing with an old mirror,” Lefty said. “It was kind of neat.” 

“Playing with a mirror?” Erin’s mom flashed my mom a bewildered glance. 

“See you guys,” Erin said, pulling her mom to the door. “Great party, Max.” 

“Yeah. Thanks,” April added. 

They headed out the front door. The rain had finally stopped. I stood at the 
screen door and watched them step around the puddles on the walk as they made 
their way to the car. 

When I turned back into the living room, Lefty was tossing the softball up 
to the ceiling, trying to catch it behind his back. He missed. The ball bounced up 
from the floor onto an end table, where it knocked over a large vase of tulips. 

What a crash! 

The vase shattered. Tulips went flying. All the water poured down onto the 
carpet. 

Mom tossed up her hands and said something silently up to the sky, the way 
she always does when she’s very pushed out of shape about something. 

Then she really got on Lefty’s case. She started screaming: “How many 



times do I have to tell you not to throw that ball in the house?” Stuff like that. 
She kept it up for quite a while. 

Lefty shrank into a corner and tried to make himself tinier and tinier. He 
kept saying he was sorry, but Mom was yelling so loud, I don’t think she heard 
him. 

I bet Lefty wanted to be invisible right at that moment. 

But he had to stand and take his punishment. 

Then he and I helped clean up the mess. 

A few minutes later, I saw him tossing the softball up in the living room 
again. 

That’s the thing about Lefty. He never learns. 

I didn’t think about the mirror again for a couple of days. I got busy with school 
and other stuff. Rehearsing for the spring concert. I’m only in the chorus, but I 
still have to go to every rehearsal. 

I saw Erin and April in school a lot. But neither of them mentioned the 
mirror. I guess maybe it slipped their minds, too. Or maybe we all just shut it out 
of our minds. 

It was kind of scary, if you stopped to think about it. 

I mean, if you believed what they said happened. 

Then that Wednesday night I couldn’t get to sleep. I was lying there, staring 
up at the ceiling, watching the shadows sway back and forth. 

I tried counting sheep. I tried shutting my eyes real tight and counting 
backwards from one thousand. 

But I was really keyed up, for some reason. Not at all sleepy. 

Suddenly I found myself thinking about the mirror up in the attic. 

What was it doing up there? I asked myself. Why was it closed up in that 
hidden room with the door carefully latched? 

Who did it belong to? My grandparents? If so, why would they hide it in 
that tiny room? 

I wondered if Mom and Dad even knew it was up there. 

I started thinking about what had happened on Saturday after my birthday 
party. I pictured myself standing in front of the mirror. Combing my hair. Then 
reaching for the chain. Pulling it. The flash of bright light as the lamp went on. 
And then... 

Did I see my reflection in the mirror after the light went on? 



I couldn’t remember. 

Did I see myself at all? My hands? My feet? 

I couldn’t remember. 

“It was a joke,” I said aloud, lying in my bed, kicking the covers off me. 

It had to be a joke. 

Lefty was always playing dumb jokes on me, trying to make me look bad. 
My brother was a joker. He’d always been a joker. He was never serious. Never. 

So what made me think he was serious now? 

Because Erin and April had agreed with him? 

Before I realized it, I had climbed out of bed. 

Only one way to find out if they were serious or not, I told myself. I 
searched in the darkness for my bedroom slippers. I buttoned my pajama shirt 
which had come undone from all my tossing and turning. 

Then, as silent as I could be, I crept out into the hallway. 

The house was dark except for the tiny night-light down by the floor just 
outside Lefty’s bedroom. Lefty was the only one in the family who ever got up 
in the middle of the night. He insisted on having a night-light in his room and 
one in the hall, even though I made fun of him about it as often as I could. 

Now I was grateful for the light as I made my way on tiptoe to the attic 
stairs. Even though I was being so careful, the floorboards squeaked under my 
feet. It’s just impossible not to make noise in an old house like this. 

I stopped and held my breath, listening hard, listening for any sign that I 
had been heard. 

Silence. 

Taking a deep breath, I opened the attic door, fumbled around till I found 
the light switch, and clicked on the attic light. Then I made my way slowly up 
the steep stairs, leaning ah my weight on the banister, trying my hardest not to 
make the stairs creak. 

It seemed to take forever to get ah the way up. Finally, I stopped at the top 
step and gazed around, letting my eyes adjust to the yellow glare of the ceiling 
light. 

The attic was hot and stuffy. The air was so dry, it made my nose burn. I 
had a sudden urge to turn around and go back. 

But then my eyes stopped at the doorway to the small, hidden room. In our 
hurry to leave, we had left the door wide open. 

Staring at the darkness beyond the open doorway, I stepped onto the 



landing and made my way quickly across the cluttered floor. The floorboards 
creaked and groaned beneath me, but I barely heard them. 

I was drawn to the open doorway, drawn to the mysterious room as if being 
pulled by a powerful magnet. 

I had to see the tall mirror again. I had to examine it, study it closely. 

I had to know the truth about it. 

I stepped into the small room without hesitating and walked up to the 
mirror. 

I paused for a moment and studied my shadowy reflection in the glass. My 
hair was totally messed up, but I didn’t care. 

I stared at myself, stared into my eyes. Then I took a step back to get a 
different view. 

The mirror reflected my entire body from head to foot. There wasn’t 
anything special about the reflection. It wasn’t distorted or weird in any way. 

The fact that it was such a normal reflection helped to calm me. I hadn’t 
realized it, but my heart was fluttering like a nervous butterfly. My hands and 
feet were cold as ice. 

“Chill out, Max,” I whispered to myself, watching myself whisper in the 
dark mirror. 

I did a funny little dance for my own benefit, waving my hands above my 
head and shaking my whole body. 

“Nothing special about this mirror,” I said aloud. 

I reached out and touched it. The glass felt cool despite the warmth of the 
room. I ran my hand along the glass until I reached the frame. Then I let my 
hand wander up and down the wood frame. It also felt smooth and cool. 

It’s just a mirror, I thought, finally feeling more relaxed. Just an old mirror 
that someone stored up here long ago and forgot about. 

Still holding onto the frame, I walked around to the back. It was too dark to 
see clearly, but it didn’t seem too interesting back here. 

Well, I might as well turn on the light at the top, I thought. 

I returned to the front of the mirror. Standing just inches back from it, I 
began to reach up for the lamp chain when something caught my eye. 

“Oh!” 

I cried out as I saw two eyes, down low in the mirror. Two eyes staring out 
at me. 



6 


My breath caught in my throat. I peered down into the dark reflection. 

The two eyes peered up at me. Dark and evil eyes. 

Uttering a cry of panic, I turned away from the mirror. 

“Lefty!” I cried. My voice came out shrill and tight, as if someone were 
squeezing my throat. 

He grinned at me from just inside the doorway. 

I realized that it had been Lefty’s eyes reflected in the mirror. 

I ran over to him and grabbed him by the shoulders. “You scared me to 
death!” I half-screamed, half-whispered. 

His grin grew wider. “You’re stupid,” he said. 

I wanted to strangle him. He thought it was a riot. 

“Why’d you sneak up behind me?” I demanded, giving him a shove back 
against the wall. 

He shrugged. 

“Well, what are you doing up here, anyway?” I sputtered. 

I could still see those dark eyes staring out at me in the mirror. So creepy! 

“I heard you,” he explained, leaning back against the wall, still grinning. “I 
was awake. I heard you walk past my room. So I followed you.” 

“Well, you shouldn’t be up here,” I snapped. 

“Neither should you,” he snapped back. 

“Go back downstairs and go to bed,” I said. My voice was finally returning 
to normal. I tried to sound as if I meant business. 

But Lefty didn’t move. “Make me,” he said. Another classic argument- 
winner. 

“I mean it,” I insisted. “Go back to bed.” 

“Make me,” he repeated nastily. “I’ll tell Mom and Dad you’re up here,” he 
added. 

I hate being threatened. And he knows it. That’s why he threatens me every 
hour of the day. 

Sometimes I just wish I could pound him. 

But we live in a nonviolent family. 



That’s what Mom and Dad say every time Lefty and I get in a fight. “Break 
it up, you two. We live in a nonviolent family.” 

Sometimes nonviolence can be real frustrating. Know what I mean? 

This was one of those times. But I could see that I wasn’t going to get rid of 
Lefty so easily. He was determined to stay up in the attic with me and see what I 
was doing with the mirror. 

My heart had finally slowed down to normal. I was starting to feel calmer. 
So I decided to stop fighting with him and let him stay. I turned back to the 
mirror. 

Luckily, there wasn’t another pair of eyes in there staring out at me! 

“What are you doing?” Lefty demanded, stepping up behind me, his arms 
still crossed over his chest. 

“Just checking out the mirror,” I told him. 

“You going to go invisible again?” he asked. He was standing right behind 
me, and his breath smelled sour, like lemons. 

I turned and shoved him back a few steps. “Get out of my face,” I said. 
“Your breath stinks.” 

That started another stupid argument, of course. 

I was sorry I’d ever come up here. I should have stayed in bed, I realized. 

Finally, I persuaded him to stand a foot away from me. A major victory. 

Yawning, I turned back to the mirror. I was starting to feel sleepy. Maybe it 
was because of the heat of the attic. Maybe it was because I was tired of arguing 
with my dopey brother. Or maybe it was because it was really late at night, and I 
was tired. 

“I’m going to turn on the light,” I told him, reaching for the chain. “Tell me 
if I go invisible again.” 

“No.” He shoved his way right next to me again. “I want to try it, too.” 

“No way,” I insisted, shoving back. 

“Yes way.” He pushed me hard. 

I pushed back. Then I had a better idea. “How about if we both stand in 
front of the mirror, and I pull the light chain?” 

“Okay. Go ahead.” Standing an inch in front of it, practically nose to nose 
with his reflection, Lefty stiffened until he was standing at attention. 

He looked ridiculous, especially in those awful green pajamas. 

I stepped up beside him. “Here goes nothing,” I said. 

I stretched my hand up, grabbed the light chain, and pulled.

The light on top of the mirror flashed. 

“Ow!” I cried out. The light was so bright, it hurt my eyes. 

Then it quickly dimmed, and my eyes started to adjust. 

I turned to Lefty and started to say something. I don’t remember what it 
was. It completely flew out of my mind when I realized that Lefty was gone. 

“L-Lefty?” I stammered. 

“I’m right here,” he replied. His voice sounded nearby, but I couldn’t see 
him. “Max—where are you?” 

“You can’t see me?” I cried. 

“No,” Lefty said. “No, I can’t.” 

I could smell his sour breath, so I knew he was there. But he was invisible. 
Gone. Out of sight. 

So they weren’t putting me on! Erin, April, and Lefty had been telling the 
truth on Saturday after my birthday party. I really had gone invisible. 

And now I was invisible again, along with my brother. 

“Hey, Max,” his voice sounded tiny, shaky. “This is weird.” 

“Yeah. It’s weird, okay,” I agreed. “You really can’t see me, Lefty?” 

“No. And I can’t see myself,” he said. 

The mirror. I had forgotten to check out the mirror. 

Did I have a reflection? 

I turned and stared into the mirror. The light was pouring down from the top 
of the frame, casting a bright glare over the glass. 

Squinting into the glare, I saw... nothing. 

No me. 

No Lefty. 

Just the reflection of the wall behind us and the open doorway leading to 
the rest of the attic. 

“We—we don’t have reflections,” I said. 

“It’s kinda cool,” Lefty remarked. He grabbed my arm. I jumped in 
surprise. 

“Hey!” I cried. 



It felt creepy to be grabbed by an invisible person. 

I grabbed him back. I tickled his ribs. He started to laugh. 

“We still have our bodies,” I said. “We just can’t see them.” 

He tried to tickle me, but I danced away from him. 

“Hey, Max, where’d you go?” he called, sounding frightened again. 

“Try and find me,” I teased, backing toward the wall. 

“I—I can’t,” he said shakily. “Come back over here, okay?” 

“No way,” I said. “I don’t want to be tickled.” 

“I won’t,” Lefty swore. “I promise.” 

I stepped back in front of the mirror. 

“Are you here?” Lefty asked timidly. 

“Yeah. I’m right beside you. I can smell your bad breath,” I told him. 

And he started to tickle me again. The little liar. 

We wrestled around for a bit. It was just so strange wrestling with someone 
you couldn’t see. 

Finally, I pushed him away. “I wonder if we could go downstairs and still 
be invisible,” I said. “I wonder if we could leave the house like this.” 

“And go spy on people?” Lefty suggested. 

“Yeah,” I said. I yawned. I was starting to feel a little strange. “We could go 
spy on girls and stuff.” 

“Cool,” Lefty replied. 

“Remember that old movie Mom and Dad were watching on TV?” I asked 
him. “About the ghosts who kept appearing and disappearing all the time? They 
had a lot of fun scaring people. You know, playing jokes on them, driving them 
crazy.” 

“But we’re not ghosts,” Lefty replied in a trembling voice. I think the idea 
kind of frightened him. 

It frightened me, too! 

“Could we go back to normal now?” Lefty asked. “I don’t feel right.” 

“Me, either,” I told him. I was feeling very light. Kind of fluttery. Just... 
weird. 

“How can we get back right again?” he asked. 

“Well, the last time, I just pulled the chain. I clicked the light off, and I was 
back. That’s all it took.” 

“Well, do it,” Lefty urged impatiently. “Right now. Okay?” 

“Yeah. Okay.” I started to feel kind of dizzy. Kind of light. As if I could 



float away or something. 

“Hurry,” Lefty said. I could hear him breathing hard. 

I reached up and grabbed the light chain. “No problem,” I told him. “We’ll 
be back in a second.” 

I pulled the chain. 

The light went out. 

But Lefty and I didn’t return.

“Max—I can’t see you!” Lefty whined. 

“I know,” I replied quietly. I felt so frightened. I had chills running down 
my back, chills that wouldn’t stop. “I can’t see you, either.” 

“What happened?” Lefty cried. I could feel him tug at my invisible arm. 

“I—I don’t know,” I stammered. “It worked before. I clicked off the light 
and I was back.” 

I gazed into the mirror. No reflection. Nothing. 

No me. No Lefty. 

I stood there, staring at the spot where our reflections should be, frozen 
with fear. I was glad Lefty couldn’t see me because I wouldn’t want him to see 
how frightened I looked. 

“Try it again, Max,” he whined. “Please. Hurry!” 

“Okay,” I said. “Just try to stay calm, okay?” 

“Stay calm? How?” Lefty wailed. “What if we never get back? What if no 
one can ever see us again?” 

I suddenly felt so sick. My stomach just sort of heaved. 

Get a grip, I told myself. You’ve got to keep it together, Max. For Lefty’s 

sake. 

I stretched up for the light chain, but it seemed to be out of my reach. 

I tried again. Missed. 

And then suddenly, I was back. And so was Lefty. 

We could see each other. And we could see our reflections in the mirror. 

“We’re back!” We both shouted it in unison. 

And then we both fell on the floor, laughing. We were so relieved. So 
happy. 

“Ssshh!” I grabbed Lefty and shoved my hand over his mouth. I just 
remembered it was the middle of the night. “If Mom and Dad catch us up here, 
they’ll kill us,” I warned, whispering. 

“Why did it take so long for us to come back?” Lefty asked, turning serious, 
gazing at his reflection. 

I shrugged. “Beats me.” I thought about it. “Maybe if you stay invisible 



longer, it takes longer for you to get back,” I suggested. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” 

“The first time I went invisible,” I told him, “it was only for a few seconds. 
And I came back instantly, as soon as I clicked off the light. But tonight—” 

“We stayed invisible a lot longer. So it took longer to come back. I get it,” 
Lefty said. 

“You’re not as dumb as you look,” I said, yawning. 

“You are!” he snapped back. 

Feeling totally exhausted, I started to lead the way out of the tiny room, 
motioning for Lefty to follow me. But he hesitated, glancing back at his 
reflection in the mirror. 

“We have to tell Mom and Dad about the mirror,” he whispered 
thoughtfully. 

“No way!” I told him. “No way we’re telling them. If we tell them about it, 
they’ll take it away. They won’t let us use it.” 

He stared at me thoughtfully. “I’m not sure I want to use it,” he said softly. 

“Well, I do,” I said, turning at the doorway to look back at it. “I want to use 
it just one more time.” 

“What for?” Lefty asked, yawning. 

“To scare Zack,” I said, grinning. 

Zack couldn’t come over until Saturday. As soon as he arrived, I wanted to take 
him up to the attic and give him a demonstration of the mirror’s powers. 

Mainly, I wanted to scare the life out of him! 

But Mom insisted that we sit down for lunch first. Canned chicken noodle 
soup and peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. 

I gulped my soup as fast as I could, not bothering to chew the noodles. 
Lefty kept giving me meaningful glances across the table. I could see that he was 
as eager as I was to scare Zack. 

“Where’d you get that haircut?” my mom asked Zack. She walked around 
the table, staring at Zack’s head, frowning. I could tell she hated it. 

“At Quick Cuts,” Zack told her after swallowing a mouthful of peanut 
butter and jelly. “You know. At the mall.” 

We all studied Zack’s haircut. I thought it was kind of cool. The way it was 
buzzed so short on the left, then hung down long on the right. 

“It’s different, all right,” my mom said. 



We all could tell she hated it. But I guess she thought she was covering up 
by calling it different. If I ever came home with a haircut like that, she’d murder 
me! 

“What did your mom say about it?” she asked Zack. 

Zack laughed. “Not much.” 

We all laughed. I kept glancing up at the clock. I was so eager to get 
upstairs. 

“How about some chocolate cupcakes?” Mom asked when we’d finished 
our sandwiches. 

Zack started to say yes, but I interrupted him. “Can we have dessert later? 
I’m kinda full.” 

I pushed back my chair and got up quickly, motioning for Zack to follow 
me. Lefty was already running to the stairs. 

“Hey—where are you going so fast?” Mom called after us, following us 
into the hall. 

“Uh... upstairs... to the attic,” I told her. 

“The attic?” She wrinkled her face, puzzled. “What’s so interesting up 
there?” 

“Uh... just a bunch of old magazines,” I lied. “They’re kind of funny. I 
want to show them to Zack.” That was pretty fast thinking, for me. I’m usually 
not very quick at making up stories. 

Mom stared at me. I don’t think she believed me. But she turned back to the 
kitchen. “Have fun, guys. Don’t get too dirty up there.” 

“We won’t,” I told her. I led Zack up the steep stairs. Lefty was already 
waiting for us in the attic. 

It was about a hundred degrees hotter up there. I started to sweat the second 
I stepped into the room. 

Zack stopped a few feet behind me and looked around. “It’s just a lot of old 
junk. What’s so interesting up here?” he asked. 

“You’ll see,” I said mysteriously. 

“This way,” Lefty called eagerly, running to the little room against the far 
wall. He was so excited, he dropped his softball. It rolled in front of him, and he 
tripped over it and fell facedown on the floor with a thud. 

“I meant to do that!” Lefty joked, climbing up quickly and leaping after the 
ball, which had rolled across the floor. 

“Your brother is made of rubber or something,” Zack laughed. 



“Falling down is his hobby,” I said. “He falls down about a hundred times a 
day.” I wasn’t exaggerating. 

A few seconds later, the three of us were in the hidden room standing in 
front of the mirror. Even though it was a sunny afternoon, the room was as dark 
and shadowy as ever. 

Zack turned from the mirror to me, a bewildered look on his face. “This is 
what you wanted to show me?” 

“Yeah.” I nodded. 

“Since when are you into furniture?” he asked. 

“It’s an interesting mirror, don’t you think?” I asked. 

“No,” he said. “Not too interesting.” 

Lefty laughed. He bounced his softball off the wall and caught it. 

I was deliberately taking my time. Zack was in for the surprise of his life, 
but I wanted to confuse him a little bit first. He was always doing stuff like that 
to me. He always acted as if he knew everything there was to know, and if I were 
good, he’d share a little bit of his knowledge with me. 

Well, now I knew something he didn’t know. I wanted to stretch this 
moment out, make it last. 

But at the same time, I couldn’t wait to watch the look on Zack’s face when 
I disappeared right in front of his eyes. 

“Let’s go outside,” Zack said impatiently. “It’s too hot up here. I brought 
my bike. Why don’t we ride to the playground behind school, see who’s there?” 

“Maybe later,” I replied, grinning at Lefty. I turned to my brother. “Should I 
show Zack our secret or not?” 

Lefty grinned back at me. He shrugged. 

“What secret?” Zack demanded. I knew he couldn’t stand to be left out of 
anything. He couldn’t bear it if anyone had a secret he didn’t know about. 

“What secret?” he repeated when I didn’t answer. 

“Show him,” Lefty said, tossing up the softball. 

I rubbed my chin, pretended to be thinking about it. “Well... okay.” I 
motioned for Zack to stand behind me. 

“You’re going to make funny faces in the mirror?” Zack guessed. He shook 
his head. “Big deal!” 

“No. That’s not the secret,” I told him. I stepped in front of the mirror, 
admiring my reflection, which stared back at me in the glass. 

“Watch!” Lefty urged, stepping up beside Zack. 



“I’m watching. I’m watching,” Zack said impatiently. 

“I’ll bet you I can disappear into thin air,” I told Zack. 

“Yeah. Sure,” he muttered. 

Lefty laughed. 

“How much do you want to bet?” I asked. 

“Two cents,” Zack said. “Is this some kind of trick mirror or something?” 
“Something like that,” I told him. “How about ten dollars? Bet me ten 
dollars?” 

“Huh?” 

“Forget the bet. Just show him,” Lefty said, bouncing up and down 
impatiently. 

“I have a magic kit at home,” Zack said. “I can do over a thousand tricks. 
But it’s kid stuff,” he sneered. 

“You don’t have any tricks like this,” I said confidently. 

“Just get it over with so we can go outside,” he grumbled. 

I stepped into the center of the mirror. “Ta -daa\” I sang myself a short 
fanfare. Then I reached up and grabbed the light chain. 

I pulled it. The lamp above the mirror flashed on, blindingly bright at first, 
then dimming as before. 

And I was gone. 

“Hey!” Zack cried. He stumbled backwards. 

He actually stumbled out of shock! 

Invisible, I turned away from the mirror to enjoy his stunned reaction. 
“Max?” he cried out. His eyes searched the room. 

Lefty was laughing his head off. 

“Max?” Zack sounded really worried. “Max? How’d you do that? Where 
are you?” 

“I’m right here,” I said. 

He jumped at the sound of my voice. Lefty laughed even harder. 

I reached out and took the softball from Lefty’s hand. I glanced at the 
reflection in the mirror. The ball seemed to float in midair. 

“Here. Catch, Zack.” I tossed it at him. 

He was so stunned, he didn’t move. The ball bounced off his chest. “Max? 
How do you do this trick?” he demanded. 

“It isn’t a trick. It’s real,” I said. 

“Hey, wait...” He got a suspicious look on his face. He ran around to the 



back of the mirror. I guess he expected me to be hiding back there. 

He looked very disappointed when he didn’t see me. “Is there a trapdoor or 
something?” he asked. He walked back in front of the mirror, got down on his 
hands and knees, and started searching the floorboards for a trapdoor. 

I leaned over and pulled his T-shirt up over his head. 

“Hey—stop it!” he yelled, climbing angrily to his feet. 

I tickled his stomach. 

“Stop, Max.” He squirmed away, thrashing his arms, trying to hit me. He 
looked really frightened now. He was breathing hard, and his face was bright 
red. 

I pulled his T-shirt up again. 

He jerked it down. “You’re really invisible?” His voice rose up so high, 
only dogs could hear it. “Really?” 

“Good trick, huh?” I said right in his ear. 

He jumped and spun away. “What does it feel like? Does it feel weird?” 

I didn’t answer him. I crept out of the room and picked up a cardboard 
carton just outside the door. I carried it up to the mirror. It looked great. A carton 
floating all by itself. 

“Put it down,” Zack urged. He sounded really scared. “This is really 
freaking me out, Max. Stop it, okay? Come back so I can see you.” 

I wanted to torture him some more, but I could see he was about to lose it. 
Besides, I was starting to feel weird again. Sort of dizzy and lightheaded. And 
the bright light was hurting my eyes, starting to blind me. 

“Okay, I’m coming back,” I announced. “Watch.” 

I leaned against the mirror and reached up for the chain. I suddenly felt very 
tired, very weak. It took all my strength to wrap my hand around the chain. 

I had the strangest sensation that the mirror was pulling me, tugging me 
toward it, holding me down. 

With a determined burst of strength, I pulled the chain. 

The lamp went out. The room darkened. 

“Where are you? I still can’t see you!” Zack cried, his voice revealing 
panic. 

“Just chill,” I told him. “It takes a few seconds. The longer I stay invisible, 
the longer it takes to come back.” And then I added, “I think.” 

Staring into the blank mirror, waiting for my reflection to return, I suddenly 
realized that I didn’t know anything at all about this mirror, about turning 



invisible. About coming back. 

My mind suddenly whirred with all sorts of terrifying questions: 

What made me think that reappearing was automatic? 

What if you could only come back twice? And after the third time you went 
invisible, you stayed invisible? 

What if the mirror was broken? What if it was locked away in this hidden 
room because it didn’t work properly and it made people stay invisible forever? 

What if I never came back? 

No, that can’t be, I told myself. 

But the seconds were ticking by. And my body was still not visible. 

I touched the mirror, rubbing my invisible hand over the smooth, cool glass. 

“Max, what’s taking so long?” Zack asked, his voice trembling. 

“I don’t know,” I told him, sounding as frightened and upset as he did. 

And then suddenly, I was back. 

I was staring at my reflection in the mirror, watching intently, gratefully, as 
a wide smile crossed my face. 

“Ta-daaa\” I sang my triumphant fanfare, turning to my still shaken friend. 
“Here lam!” 

“Wow!” Zack exclaimed, and his mouth remained in a tight O of surprise 
and wonder. “Wow.” 

“I know,” I said, grinning. “Pretty cool, huh?” 

I felt very shaky, kind of trembly all over. My knees felt all weak and 
sweaty. You know the feeling. 

But I ignored it. I wanted to enjoy my moment of glory. It wasn’t often that 
I got to do something that Zack hadn’t already done ten times. 

“Amazing,” Zack said, staring hard at the mirror. “I’ve got to try it!” 

“Well...” I wasn’t so sure I wanted Zack to do it. It was such a big 
responsibility. I mean, what if something went wrong? 

“You’ve got to let me do it!” Zack insisted. 

“Hey—where’s Lefty?” I asked, glancing quickly around the small room. 

“Huh? Lefty?” Zack’s eyes searched, too. 

“I was so busy being invisible, I forgot he was here,” I said. And then I 
called, “Hey, Lefty?” 

No reply. 

“Lefty?” 

Silence. 



I walked quickly around to the back of the mirror. He wasn’t there. Calling 
his name, I made my way to the door and peered out into the attic. 

No sign of him. 

“He was standing right here. In front of the mirror,” Zack said, suddenly 

pale. 

“Lefty?” I called. “Are you here? Can you hear me?” 

Silence. 

“Weird,” Zack said. 

I swallowed hard. My stomach suddenly felt as if I’d swallowed a rock. 

“He was right here. Standing right here,” Zack said in a shrill, frightened 
voice. 

“Well, he’s gone now,” I said, staring at the dark, shadowy reflection of the 
mirror. “Lefty’s gone.”

“Maybe Lefty went invisible, too,” Zack suggested. 

“Then why doesn’t he answer us?” I cried. I tried calling my brother again. 
“Lefty—are you here? Can you hear me?” 

No reply. 

I walked up to the mirror and angrily slapped the frame. “Stupid mirror.” 
“Lefty? Lefty?” Zack had his hands cupped around his mouth like a 
megaphone. He stood at the door to the little room, calling out into the attic. 

“I don’t believe this,” I said weakly. My legs were shaking so much, I 
dropped down onto the floor. 

And then I heard giggling. 

“Huh? Lefty?” I jumped to my feet. 

More giggling. Coming from behind the carton I’d carried into the little 
room. 

I lunged toward the carton just as Lefty popped up from behind it. 
“Gotcha!” he cried, and collapsed over the carton, slapping the floor, laughing 
his head off. 

“Gotcha! Gotcha both!” 

“You little creep!” Zack screamed. 

He and I both pounced on Lefty at the same time. I pulled his arm back 
until he screamed. Zack messed up his hair, then tickled him. 

Lefty was screaming and laughing and squirming and crying all at the same 
time. I gave him a hard punch on the shoulder. “Don’t ever do that again,” I 
shouted angrily. 

Lefty laughed, so I gave him a hard shove and climbed to my feet. 

Zack and I, both breathing hard, both red in the face, glared angrily at Lefty. 
He was rolling around on the floor, covered in dust, still laughing like a lunatic. 
“You scared us to death. You really did!” I exclaimed heatedly. 

“I know,” Lefty replied happily. 

“Let’s beat him up some more,” Zack suggested, balling his hands into tight 

fists. 

“Okay,” I agreed. 



“You’ll have to catch me first!” Lefty cried. He was on his feet in a flash, 
and out the door. 

I chased after him, tripped over a stack of old clothes, and went flying 
headfirst to the floor. “Ow!” I banged my leg hard. The pain shot up through my 
body. 

Pulling myself up slowly, I started after Lefty again. But voices on the attic 
stairway made me stop. 

Erin’s head popped up first. Then April appeared. 

Lefty was sitting on the windowsill at the far end of the attic, red-faced and 
sweaty, catching his breath. 

“Hey, how’s it going?” I called to the two girls, brushing dust off my jeans, 
then straightening my hair with one hand. 

“Your mom said you were here,” Erin explained, looking from Lefty to me. 

“What are you guys doing up here?” April asked. 

“Oh... just hanging out,” I said, casting an angry glance at my brother, who 
stuck his tongue out in reply. 

April picked up an old Life magazine from a stack of yellowed magazines 
and began flipping through it. But the pages crumbled as she looked at them. 
“Yuck,” she said, putting it down. “This stuff is so old.” 

“That’s what attics are for,” I said, starting to feel a little more normal. 
“Whoever heard of keeping new stuff in an attic?” 

“Ha-ha,” Lefty laughed sarcastically. 

“Where’s that mirror?” Erin asked, stepping into the center of the room. 
“The one that made that weird optical illusion last Saturday.” 

“It wasn’t an optical illusion,” I blurted out. I didn’t really feel like messing 
with the mirror anymore. I’d had enough scares for one afternoon. But the words 
just tumbled out of me. 

I can never keep a secret. It’s a real character flaw. 

“What do you mean?” Erin asked, very interested. She walked past me, 
heading to the open doorway of the little room. 

“You mean that wasn’t an optical illusion last week?” April asked, 
following her. 

“No, not really,” I said, glancing at Lefty, who hadn’t budged from the 
windowsill across the large room. “The mirror has strange powers or something. 
It really can turn you invisible.” 

April laughed scornfully. “Yeah. Right,” she said. “And I’m going to fly to 



Mars in a flying saucer tonight after dinner.” 

“Give me a break,” I muttered. I turned my eyes to Erin. “I’m serious.” 

Erin stared back at me, her face filled with doubt. “You’re trying to tell us 
that you’ve gone in that room and become invisible?” 

“I’m not trying to tell you,” I replied heatedly. “I am telling you!” 

April laughed. 

Erin continued to stare at me, studying my face. “You are serious,” she 
decided. 

“It’s a trick mirror,” April told her. “That’s all. That light on top of it is so 
bright, it makes your eyes go weird.” 

“Show us,” Erin said to me. 

“Yeah. Show them!” Lefty exclaimed eagerly. He jumped up from the 
windowsill and started running to the little room. “I’ll go this time! Let me do 
it!” 

“No way,” I said. 

“Let me try it,” Erin volunteered. 

“Hey, do you know who else is here?” I asked the girls, following them to 
the room. “Zack is here.” I called to him. “Hey, Zack. Erin wants to go invisible. 
Think we should let her?” 

I stepped into the room. “Zack?” 

“Where’s he hiding?” Erin asked. 

I uttered a silent gasp. 

The mirror light was on. Zack was gone.

“Oh, no!” I cried. “I don’t believe this!” 

Lefty laughed. “Zack’s invisible,” he told Erin and April. 

“Zack—where are you?” I demanded angrily. 

Suddenly, the softball floated up from Lefty’s hand. “Hey, give that back!” 
Lefty shouted, and grabbed for it. But invisible Zack pulled the ball out of 
Lefty’s reach. 

Erin and April were both gaping at the ball as it floated in midair, their eyes 
bulging, their mouths wide open. 

“Hi, girls,” Zack called in a booming, deep voice that floated from in front 
of the mirror. 

April screamed and grabbed Erin’s arm. 

“Zack, stop kidding around. How long have you been invisible?” I asked. 

“I don’t know.” The ball flew back to Lefty, who dropped it and had to 
chase it out into the attic. 

“How long, Zack?” I repeated. 

“About five minutes, maybe,” he replied. 

“When you chased after Lefty, I turned on the light and went invisible. 
Then I heard you talking to Erin and April.” 

“You’ve been invisible the whole time?” I asked, feeling really nervous and 
upset. 

“Yeah. This is awesome!” he exclaimed. But then his tone grew doubtful. “I 
—I’m starting to feel kinda funny, though, Max.” 

“Funny?” Erin asked, staring at where Zack’s voice seemed to be coming 
from. “What do you mean ‘funny’?” 

“Kinda dizzy,” Zack replied weakly. “Everything’s kind of breaking up. 
You know. Like a bad TV picture. I mean, you’re starting to fade, to seem far 
away.” 

“I’m bringing you back,” I said. And without waiting for Zack to reply, I 
reached up and pulled the light chain. 

The light clicked off. Darkness seemed to roll into the room, filling the 
mirror with gray shadows. 

“Where is he?” April cried. “It didn’t work. He isn’t back.” 



“It takes a while,” I explained. 

“How long?” April asked. 

“I don’t really know,” I said. 

“Why aren’t I back?” Zack asked. He was standing right beside me. I could 
feel his breath on my neck. “I can’t see myself.” He sounded very frightened. 

“Don’t get tense,” I said, forcing myself to sound calm. “You know it takes 
a while. Especially since you stayed invisible so long.” 

“But how long?” Zack wailed. “Shouldn’t I be back by now? You were back 
by now. I remember.” 

“Just stay cool,” I told him, even though my stomach was churning and my 
throat was dry. 

“This is too scary. I hate this!” April moaned. 

“Be patient,” I repeated softly. “Everybody just be patient.” 

We all stared from the spot where we thought Zack was standing to the 
mirror, then back again. 

“Zack, how do you feel?” Erin asked, her voice trembling. 

“Weird,” Zack replied. “Like I’m never coming back.” 

“Don’t say that!” I snapped. 

“But that’s how I feel,” Zack said sadly. “Like I’m never coming back.” 

“Just chill,” I said. “Everybody. Just chill.” 

We stood in silence. Watching. Waiting. 

Waiting. 

I was never so frightened in all my life.

“Do something!” Zack, still invisible, pleaded. “Max—you’ve got to do 
something!” 

“I—I’d better get Mom,” Lefty stammered. He dropped the softball to the 
floor and started to the door. 

“Mom? What could Mom do?” I cried in a panic. 

“But I’d better get somebody !” Lefty declared. 

At that moment, Zack shimmered back into view. “Wow!” He uttered a 
long, breathless sigh of relief and slumped to his knees on the floor. 

“Yaaaay!” Erin cried happily, clapping her hands as we all gathered around 
Zack. 

“How do you feel?” I asked, grabbing his shoulders. I think I wanted to 
know for sure that he was really back. 

“I’m back!” Zack proclaimed, smiling. “That’s all I care about.” 

“That was really scary,” April said quietly, hands shoved into the pockets of 
her white tennis shorts. “I mean, really.” 

“I wasn’t scared,” Zack said, suddenly changing his tune. “I knew there was 
no problem.” 

Do you believe this guy? 

One second, he’s whining and wailing, begging me to do something. 

The next second, he’s pretending he had the time of his life. Mister 
Confident. 

“What did it feel like?” Erin asked, resting one hand on the wooden mirror 
frame. 

“Awesome,” Zack replied. He climbed unsteadily to his feet. “Really. It was 
totally awesome! I want to get invisible again before school on Monday so I can 
go spy in the girls’ locker room!” 

“Zack, you’re a pig!” Erin declared disgustedly. 

“What’s the point of being invisible if you can’t spy on girls?” Zack asked. 

“Are you sure you’re okay?” I asked, genuinely concerned. “You look kind 
of shaky to me.” 

“Well, I started to feel a little strange at the end,” Zack confessed, 
scratching the back of his head. 



“How do you mean?” I asked. 

“Well, like I was being pulled away. Away from the room. Away from you 
guys.” 

“Pulled where?” I demanded. 

He shrugged. “I don’t know. I only know one thing.” A smile began to form 
on his face, and his blue eyes seemed to light up. 

Uh-oh, I thought. 

“I only know one thing,” Zack repeated. 

“What?” I had to ask. 

“I’m the new invisible champ. I stayed invisible longer than you. At least 
five minutes. Longer than anybody.” 

“But I haven’t had a turn!” Erin protested. 

“I don’t want a turn!” April declared. 

“Chicken?” Zack teased her. 

“I think you’re stupid for messing around with this,” April said heatedly. “It 
isn’t a toy, you know. You don’t know anything about it. You don’t know what it 
really does to your body.” 

“I feel fine!” Zack told her, and pounded his chest with both hands like a 
gorilla to prove it. He glanced at the dark mirror. “I’m ready to go back—even 
longer.” 

“I want to get invisible and go outside and play tricks on people,” Lefty 
said enthusiastically. “Can I go next, Max?” 

“I—I don’t think so....” 

I was thinking about what April had said. We really were messing around 
with something that could be dangerous, something we didn’t know anything 
about. 

“Max has to go again,” Zack said, slapping me hard on the back, nearly 
sending me sprawling against the mirror. “To beat my record.” He grinned at me. 
“Unless you’re chicken, too.” 

“I’m not chicken!” I insisted. “I just think—” 

“You’re chicken,” Zack accused, laughing scornfully. He started clucking 
loudly, flapping his arms like a chicken. 

“I’m not chicken. Let me go,” Lefty pleaded. “I can break Zack’s record.” 

“It’s my turn,” Erin insisted. “You guys have all had turns. I haven’t gone 
once yet!” 

“Okay,” I said with a shrug. “You go first, Erin. Then me.” I was glad Erin 



was so eager to do it. I really didn’t feel like getting invisible again just yet. 

To be honest, I felt very fluttery and nervous. 

“Me next!” Lefty insisted. “Me next! Me next!” He started chanting the 
words over and over. 

I clamped my hand over his mouth. “Maybe we should all go downstairs,” I 
suggested. 

“Chicken?” Zack teased. “You’re chickening out?” 

“I don’t know, Zack,” I replied honestly. “I think—” I saw Erin staring at 
me. Was that disappointment on her face? Did Erin think I was a chicken, too? 

“Okay,” I said. “Go ahead, Erin. You go. Then I’ll go. Then Lefty. We’ll all 
beat Zack’s record.” 

Erin and Lefty clapped. April groaned and rolled her eyes. Zack grinned. 

It’s no big deal, I told myself. I’ve done it three times already. It’s perfectly 
painless. And if you just stay cool and wait patiently, you come right back the 
way you were. 

“Does anyone have a watch?” Erin asked. “We need to keep time so I know 
what time I have to beat.” 

I could see that Erin was really into this competition. 

Lefty seemed really excited, too. And of course Zack would compete in 
anything. 

Only April was unhappy about the whole thing. She walked silently to the 
back of the room and sat down on the floor with her back against the wall, her 
arms folded over her knees. 

“Hey, you’re the only one with a watch,” Erin called to April. “So you be 
the timer, okay?” 

April nodded without enthusiasm. She raised her wrist and stared down at 
her watch. “Okay. Get ready.” 

Erin took a deep breath and stepped up to the mirror. She closed her eyes, 
reached up, and tugged the light chain. 

The light came on with a bright flash. Erin disappeared. 

“Oh, wow!” she cried. “This is way cool!” 

“How does it feel?” April called from behind us, her eyes glancing from the 
mirror to her watch. 

“I don’t feel any different at all,” Erin said. “What a great way to lose 
weight!” 

“Fifteen seconds,” April announced. 



Lefty’s hair suddenly stood straight up in the air. “Cut it out, Erin!” he 
shouted, twisting away from her invisible hands. 

We heard Erin laugh from somewhere near Lefty. 

Then we heard her footsteps as she walked out of the room and into the 
attic. We saw an old coat rise up into the air and dance around. After it dropped 
back into its carton, we saw an old magazine fly up and its pages appear to flip 
rapidly. 

“This is so much fun!” Erin called to us. The magazine dropped back onto 
the stack. “I can’t wait to go outside like this and really scare people!” 

“One minute,” April called. She hadn’t moved from her sitting position 
against the wall. 

Erin moved around the attic for a while, making things fly and float. Then 
she returned to the little room to admire herself in the mirror. 

“I’m really invisible!” we heard her exclaim excitedly. “Just like in a movie 
or something!” 

“Yeah. Great special effects!” I said. 

“Three minutes,” April announced. 

Erin continued to enjoy herself until about four minutes had passed. Then 
her voice suddenly changed. She started to sound doubtful, frightened. 

“I—I don’t like this,” she said. “I feel kind of strange.” 

April jumped to her feet and ran up to me. “Bring her back!” she demanded. 
“Hurry!” 

I hesitated. 

“Yes. Bring me back,” Erin said weakly. 

“But you haven’t beaten my record!” Zack declared. “Are you sure—?” 

“Yes. Please. I don’t feel right.” Erin suddenly sounded far away. 

I stepped up to the mirror and pulled the chain. The light clicked off. 

We waited for Erin to return. 

“How do you feel?” I asked. 

“Just... weird,” she replied. She was standing right next to me, but I still 
couldn’t see her. 

It took nearly three minutes for Erin to reappear. Three very tense minutes. 

When she shimmered back into view, she shook herself like a dog shaking 
water off after a bath. Then she grinned at us reassuringly. “I’m okay. It was 
really terrific. Except for the last few seconds.” 

“You didn’t beat my record,” Zack reported happily. “You came so close. 



But you folded. Just like a girl.” 

“Hey—” Erin gave Zack a hard shove. “Stop being such a jerk.” 

“But you only had fifteen seconds to go, and you wimped out!” Zack told 
her. 

“I don’t care,” Erin insisted, frowning angrily at him. “It was really neat. 
I’ll beat your record next time, Zack.” 

“I’m going to be the winner,” Lefty announced. “I’m going to stay invisible 
for a whole day. Maybe two!” 

“Whoa!” I cried. “That might be dangerous, Lefty.” 

“It’s Max’s turn next,” Zack announced. “Unless you want to forfeit.” 

“No way,” I said, glancing at Erin. Reluctantly, I stepped up to the mirror 
and took a deep breath. “Okay, Zack, say good-bye to your record,” I said, trying 
to sound calm and confident. 

I didn’t really want to do it, I admitted to myself. But I didn’t want to look 
like a chicken in front of the others. For one thing, if I did wimp out, I knew that 
Lefty would only remind me of it twenty or thirty times a day for the rest of my 
life. 

So I decided to go ahead and do it. 

“One thing,” I said to Zack. “When I call out ‘ready’, that means I want to 
come back. So when I say ‘ready’, you pull the light chain as fast as you can— 
okay?” 

“Gotcha,” Zack replied, his expression turning serious. “Don’t worry. I’ll 
bring you back instantly.” He snapped his fingers. “Like that. Remember, Max, 
you’ve got to beat five minutes.” 

“Okay. Here goes,” I said, staring at my reflection in the mirror. 

I suddenly had a bad feeling about this. 

A real bad feeling. 

But I reached up and pulled on the light anyway. 



12 


When the glaring light dimmed, I stared hard into the mirror. 

The reflections were bright and clear. Against the back wall, I could see 
April, slumped on the floor, staring intently at her watch. 

Lefty stood near the wall to the right, gaping at the spot where I had stood, 
a silly grin on his face. Zack stood next to him, his arms crossed over his chest, 
also staring into the mirror. Erin leaned against the wall to the left. Her eyes 
were on the light above the mirror frame. 

And where was I? 

Standing right in front of the mirror. Right in the center of it. Staring at their 
reflections. Staring at the spot where my reflection should be. 

Only it wasn’t. 

I felt perfectly normal. 

Experimenting, I kicked the floor. My invisible sneakers made the usual 
scraping sound. 

I grabbed my left arm with my right hand and squeezed it. It felt perfectly 
normal. 

“Hi, everyone,” I said. I sounded the same as ever. 

Only I was invisible. 

I glanced up at the light, casting a yellow rectangle down onto the mirror. 
What was the light’s power? I wondered. 

Did it do something to your molecules? Make them break apart somehow 
so you couldn’t be seen? 

No. That wasn’t a good theory. If your molecules broke up, you’d have to 
feel it. And you wouldn’t be able to kick the floor, or squeeze your arm, or talk. 

So what did the light do? Did it cover you up somehow? Did the light form 
some kind of blanket? A covering that hid you from yourself and everyone else? 

What a mystery! 

I had the feeling I’d never be able to figure it out, never know the answer. 

I turned my eyes away from the light. It was starting to hurt my eyes. 

I closed my eyes, but the bright glare stayed with me. Two white circles that 
refused to dim. 

“How do you feel, Max?” Erin’s voice broke into my thoughts. 



“Okay, I guess,” I said. My voice sounded weird to me, kind of far away. 
“Four minutes, thirty seconds,” April announced. 

“The time went so fast,” I said. 

At least, I thought I said it. I realized I couldn’t tell if I was saying the 
words or just thinking them. 

The bright yellow light glowed even brighter. 

I had the sudden feeling that it was pouring over me, surrounding me. 
Pulling me. 

“I—I feel weird,” I said. 

No response. 

Could they hear me? 

The light folded over me. I felt myself begin to float. 

It was a frightening feeling. As if I were losing control of my body. 
“Ready!” I screamed. “Zack—ready! Can you hear me, Zack?” 

It seemed to take Zack hours to reply. “Okay,” I heard him say. His voice 
sounded so tiny, so far away. 

Miles and miles away. 

“Ready!” I cried. “Ready!” 

“Okay!” Again I heard Zack’s voice. 

But the light was so bright, so blindingly bright. Waves of yellow light 
rolling over me. Ocean waves of light. 

Sweeping me away with it. 

“Pull the chain, Zack!” I screamed. At least, I think I was screaming. 

The light was tugging me so hard, dragging me away, far, far away. 

I knew I would float away. Float forever. 

Unless Zack pulled the chain and brought me back. 

“Pull it! Pull it! Please —pull it!” 

“Okay.” 

I saw Zack step up to the mirror. 

He was blurred in shadows. He stepped through dark shadows, on the other 
side of the light. 

So far away. 

I felt so feather light. 

I could see Zack in the shadows. He jumped up. He grabbed the lamp chain. 
He pulled it down hard. 



The light didn’t click off. It glowed even brighter. 

And then I saw Zack’s face fill with horror. 

He held up his hand. He was trying to show me something. 

He had the chain in his hand. 

“Max, the chain—” he stammered. “It broke off. I can’t turn off the light!” 



13 


Beyond the shimmering wall of yellow light, Zack’s outstretched hand came 
clearly into my view. The dark chain dangled from his hand like a dead snake. 

“It broke off!” he was crying, sounding very alarmed. 

I stared through the light at the chain, feeling myself hovering beside Zack, 
floating, fading. 

Somewhere far in the distance, April was screaming. I couldn’t make out 
her words. 

Lefty stood frozen in the center of the room. It seemed strange to see him 
standing so still. He was always moving, always bouncing, running, falling. But 
now he, too, stood staring at the chain. 

The light shimmered brighter. 

I saw sudden movement. 

Someone was crossing the room. I struggled to focus. 

It was Erin. She was dragging a large cardboard box across the floor. The 
scraping sound it made seemed so far away. 

Feeling myself being pulled away, I struggled to watch her. She pulled the 
box next to the mirror. Then she climbed up onto it. 

I saw her reaching up to the lamp. I saw her staring into the light. 

I wanted to ask her what she was doing, but I was too far away. I was 
floating off. I felt so light, so feather light. 

And as I floated, the yellow light spread over me. It covered me. Pulled me. 

And then with startling suddenness, it was gone. 

And all was darkness. 

“I did it!” Erin proclaimed. 

I heard her explaining to the others. “There was a little bit of chain left up 
there. I pulled it and turned off the light.” Her eyes darted frantically around the 
room, searching for me. “Max—are you okay? Can you hear me?” 

“Yeah. I’m okay,” I replied. 

I felt better. Stronger. Closer. 

I stepped up to the mirror and searched for my reflection. 

“That was scary,” Lefty said behind me. 



“I can feel myself coming back,” I told them. 

“What was his time?” Zack asked April. 

April’s features were tight with worry. Sitting against the wall, she looked 
pale and uncomfortable. “Five forty-eight,” she told Zack. And then quickly 
added, “I really think this stupid competition is a big mistake.” 

“You beat my record!” Zack groaned, turning to where he figured I was 
standing. “I don’t believe it! Almost six minutes!” 

“I’m going for longer than that,” Lefty said, pushing past Zack and stepping 
up to the mirror. 

“We have to fix the chain first,” Erin told him. “It’s too hard to keep 
climbing up on a box to pull that little piece of chain.” 

“I felt pretty strange at the end,” I told them, still waiting to reappear. “The 
light grew brighter and brighter.” 

“Did you feel like you were being pulled away?” Erin asked. 

“Yeah,” I replied. “Like I was fading or something.” 

“That’s how / started to feel,” Erin cried. 

“This is just so dangerous,” April said, shaking her head. 

I popped back. 

My knees buckled and I almost fell to the floor. But I grabbed the mirror 
and held myself up. After a few seconds, my legs felt strong again. I took a few 
steps and regained my balance. 

“What if we couldn’t turn off the light?” April demanded, climbing to her 
feet, brushing the dust off the back of her jeans with both hands. “What if the 
chain completely broke and the light stayed on? What then?” 

I shrugged. “I don’t know.” 

“You broke my record,” Zack said, making a disgusted face. “That means I 
have to have another turn.” 

“No way!” Lefty shouted. “It’s my turn next!” 

“None of you are listening to me!” April cried. “Answer my question. What 
if one of you is invisible and the light won’t go out?” 

“That won’t happen,” Zack told her. He pulled a string from his pocket. 
“Here. I’m going to tie this tightly to the chain.” He climbed up onto the box and 
began to work. “Pull the string. The light goes out,” he told April. “No 
problem.” 

“Which one of us is going to be first to get invisible and then go outside?” 
Erin asked. 



“I want to go to school and terrorize Miss Hawkins,” Lefty said, snickering. 
Miss Hawkins is his social studies teacher. “She’s been terrorizing me ever since 
school started. Wouldn’t it be cool just to sneak up behind her and say, ‘Hi, Miss 
Hawkins’? And she’d turn around and there’d be no one there?” 

“That’s the best you can do?” Erin scoffed. “Lefty, where’s your 
imagination? Don’t you want to make the chalk fly out of her hand, and the 
chalkboard erasers fly across the room, and the wastebasket spill everything out 
on her desk, and her yogurt fly into her face?” 

“Yeah! That’s way cool!” Lefty exclaimed. 

I laughed. It was a funny idea. The four of us could go around, completely 
invisible, doing whatever we wanted. We could wreck the whole school in ten 
minutes! Everyone would be screaming and running out the doors. What a goof! 

“We can’t do it now,” Lefty said, interrupting my thoughts. “Because it’s 
my turn to beat the record.” He turned back to April, who was standing tensely 
by the door, pulling at a strand of her black hair, a worried frown on her face. 
“Ready to time me?” 

“I guess,” she replied, sighing. 

Lefty pushed me out of the way. He stepped in front of the mirror, stared at 
his reflection, and reached for the string. 



14 


“Lefty!” a voice shouted from behind us. “Lefty!” 

Startled by the interruption, I uttered an alarmed cry. Lefty stepped back 
from the mirror. 

“Lefty, tell your brother his friends have to leave! It’s dinnertime. Grammy 
and Poppy are here. They’re eager to see you!” 

It was Mom, calling up from downstairs. 

“Okay, Mom. We’ll be right down!” I shouted quickly. I didn’t want her to 
come up. 

“But that’s not fair!” Lefty whined. “I didn’t get my turn.” 

He stepped back up to the mirror and angrily grabbed for the string again. 

“Put it down,” I told him sternly. “We have to go downstairs. Quick. We 
don’t want Mom or Dad coming up here and seeing the mirror, do we?” 

“Okay, okay,” Lefty grumbled. “But next time, I get to go first.” 

“And then me,” Zack said, heading toward the stairs. “I get a chance to beat 
your record, Max.” 

“Everybody, stop talking about it,” I warned as we all clomped down the 
stairs. “Talk about something else. We don’t want them to overhear anything.” 

“Can we come over tomorrow?” Erin asked. “We could start up the contest 
again.” 

“I’m busy tomorrow,” April said. 

“We can’t do it tomorrow,” I replied. “We’re visiting my cousins in 
Springfield.” I was sorry they’d reminded me. My cousins have this humongous 
sheepdog that likes to run through the mud and then jump on me and wipe its 
hairy paws all over my clothes. Not my idea of a good time. 

“There’s no school on Wednesday,” Zack said. “Teachers’ meetings, I think. 
Maybe we could all come over on Wednesday.” 

“Maybe,” I said. 

We stepped into the hallway. Everyone stopped talking. I could see that my 
grandparents and parents were already sitting at the dining room table. Grammy 
and Poppy liked to eat promptly. If their dinner came one minute late, it made 
them real cranky for the rest of the day. 

I ushered my friends out quickly, reminding them not to tell anyone about 



what we’d been doing. Zack asked again if Wednesday would be okay, and again 
I told him I wasn’t sure. 

Getting invisible was really exciting, really thrilling. But it also made me 
nervous. I wasn’t sure I wanted to do it again so soon. 

“Please!” Zack begged. He couldn’t wait to get invisible again and beat my 
record. He couldn’t stand it that he wasn’t the champ. 

I closed the front door behind them and hurried to the dining room to greet 
my grandparents. They were already slurping their soup when I came in. 

“Hi, Grammy. Hi, Poppy.” I walked around the table and gave them each a 
kiss on the cheek. Grammy smelled of oranges. Her cheek felt soft and mushy. 

Grammy and Poppy are the names I gave them when I was a kid. It’s really 
embarrassing to call them that now, but I still do. I don’t have much choice. 
They even call each other Grammy and Poppy! 

They look alike, almost like brother and sister. I guess that’s what happens 
when you’ve been married a hundred years. They both have long, thin faces and 
short white hair. They both wear thick glasses with silver wire frames. They’re 
both really skinny. And they both have sad eyes and sad expressions. 

I didn’t feel like sitting there at dinner and making small talk with them 
today. I was still really pumped about what we’d been doing all afternoon. 

Being invisible was just so weird and exciting. 

I wanted to be by myself and think about it. You know. Try to relive it, 
relive what it felt like. 

A lot of times after I’ve done something really exciting or interesting, I like 
to go up to my room, lie down on my bed, and just think about it. Analyze it. 
Tear it apart. 

Dad says I have a very scientific mind. I guess he’s right. 

I walked over to my place at the table. 

“You’re looking much shorter,” Poppy said, wiping his mouth with his cloth 
napkin. That was one of his standard jokes. He said it every time he saw me. 

I forced a laugh and sat down. 

“Your soup must be ice cold by now,” Grammy said, clicking her tongue. 
“Nothing I hate more than cold soup. I mean, what’s the point of having soup if 
it isn’t steaming hot?” 

“It tastes okay,” I said, taking a spoonful. 

“We had some delicious cold soup last summer,” Poppy said. He loved to 
contradict Grammy and start arguments with her. “Strawberry soup, remember? 



You wouldn’t want that hot, would you?” 

“It wasn’t strawberry,” Grammy told him, frowning. “It wasn’t even soup. 
It was some kind of fancy yogurt.” 

“No, it wasn’t,” Poppy insisted. “It was definitely cold soup.” 

“You’re wrong, as usual,” Grammy snapped. 

This could get ugly, I thought. “What kind of soup is this?” I asked, trying 
to stop their arguing. 

“Chicken noodle,” Mom answered quickly. “Didn’t you recognize it?” 

“Poppy and I had soup a few weeks ago that we couldn’t recognize,” my 
grandmother said, shaking her head. “I had to ask the waiter what it was. It 
didn’t look like what we’d ordered at all. Some kind of potato-leek soup, wasn’t 
it, Poppy?” 

Poppy took a long time swallowing some noodles. “No. Tomato,” he 
answered. 

“Where’s your brother?” Dad asked, staring at the empty chair next to me. 

“Huh?” I reacted with surprise. I had been so busy listening to my 
grandparents’ silly soup arguments, I had forgotten all about Lefty. 

“His soup is getting cold,” Poppy said. 

“You’ll have to heat it up for him,” Grammy said, tsk-tsking again. 

“So where is he?” Dad asked. 

I shrugged. “He was right behind me,” I said. I turned toward the dining 
room doorway and shouted, “Lefty! Lef-teeeee!” 

“Don’t shout at the table,” Mom scolded. “Get up and go find him.” 

“Is there any more soup?” Poppy asked. “I didn’t really get enough.” 

I put my napkin down and started to get up. But before I was out of my 
chair, I saw Lefty’s soup bowl rise up into the air. 

Oh, no! I thought. 

I knew instantly what was happening. 

My idiot brother had made himself invisible, and now he thought he was 
being funny, trying to scare the daylights out of everyone at the table. 

The soup bowl floated up over Lefty’s place. 

I stood up and lunged for it and pulled it down as fast as I could. 

“Get out!” I whispered loudly to Lefty. 

“What did you say?” my mom asked, gaping at me. 

“I said I’m getting out and going to find Lefty,” I told her, thinking quickly. 

“Get out—now!” I whispered to Lefty. 



“Stop talking about finding him. Just go do it,” my mom said impatiently. 

I stood up just as my dumb invisible brother raised his water glass. The 
glass floated up over the table. 

I gasped and grabbed for it. 

But I grabbed too hard. I jerked the glass, and water spilled all over the 
table. 

“Hey!” Mom screamed. 

I pulled the glass down to its place. 

Then I looked up. Dad was glaring at me, his eyes burning angrily into 
mine. 

He knows, I thought, a heavy feeling of dread sweeping over me. 

He saw what just happened, and he knows. 

Lefty has spoiled it for everyone. 



15 


Dad glared angrily across the table at me. 

I waited for him to say, “Max, why is your brother invisible?” But instead, 
he yelled, “Stop fooling around, Max. We don’t appreciate your comedy act. Just 
get up and find your brother.” 

I was so relieved. Dad hadn’t realized what was really happening, after all. 
He thought I was just goofing. 

“Is there seconds on the soup?” I heard Poppy ask again as I gratefully 
pushed away from the table and hurried out of the dining room. 

“You’ve had enough,” Grammy scolded. 

“No, I haven’t!” 

I made my way quickly through the living room, taking long strides, 
climbed to the second floor, and stopped in the hallway at the door to the attic 
stairs. “Lefty?” I whispered. “I hope you followed me.” 

“I’m here,” Lefty whispered back. I couldn’t see him, of course, but he was 
right beside me. 

“What’s the big idea?” I demanded angrily. I wasn’t angry. I was furious. 
“Are you trying to win the stupid championship?” 

Lefty didn’t care that I was upset. He started to giggle. 

“Shut up!” I whispered. “Just shut up! You really are a dork!” 

I clicked on the attic light and clomped angrily up the stairs. I could hear his 
sneakers clomping up behind mine. 

He was still giggling at the top of the stairs. “I win!” he declared. I felt a 
hand slap me hard on the back. 

“Stop it, jerk!” I screamed, storming into the little room that housed the 
mirror. “Don’t you realize you nearly spoiled it for everybody?” 

“But I win!” he repeated gleefully. 

The lamp over the mirror was shining brightly, the reflection glaring sun- 
yellow in the mirror. 

I really couldn’t believe Lefty. He was usually a pretty selfish kid. But not 
this selfish! 

“Don’t you realize the trouble you could have gotten us into?” I cried. 

“I win! I win!” he chanted. 



“Why? How long have you been invisible?” I asked. I stepped up to the 
mirror and pulled the string. The light went out. The glare remained in my eyes. 

“Ever since you guys went downstairs,” Lefty, still invisible, bragged. 

“That’s almost ten minutes!” I exclaimed. 

“I’m the champ!” Lefty proclaimed. 

I stared into the mirror, waiting for him to reappear. 

“The stupidity champ,” I repeated. “This was the dumbest thing you’ve 
ever done.” 

He didn’t say anything. Linally, he asked in a quiet voice, “Why is it taking 
so long for me to come back?” 

Before I could answer, I heard Dad calling from downstairs: “Max? Are 
you two up there?” 

“Yeah. We’ll be right down,” I shouted. 

“What are you two doing up there?” Dad demanded. I heard him start to 
climb the stairs. 

I ran to the top of the stairs to head him off. “Sorry, Dad,” I said. “We’re 
coming.” 

Dad stared up at me in the stairwell. “What on earth is so interesting up 
there?” 

“Just a lot of old stuff,” I muttered. “Nothing, really.” 

Lefty appeared behind me, looking like his old self. Dad disappeared back 
to the dining room. Lefty and I started down the stairs. 

“Wow, that was awesome !” Lefty exclaimed. 

“Didn’t you start to feel weird after a while?” I asked him, whispering even 
though we were alone. 

“No.” He shook his head. “I felt fine. It was really awesome ! You should 
have seen the look on your face when I made the soup bowl float up in the air!” 
He started giggling again, that high-pitched giggle of his that I hate. 

“Listen, Lefty,” I warned, stopping at the bottom of the stairs, blocking his 
way to the hallway. “Getting invisible is fun, but it could be dangerous. You—” 

“It’s awesome!” he repeated. “And I’m the new champ.” 

“Listen to me,” I said heatedly, grabbing him by the shoulders. “Just listen. 
You’ve got to promise me that you won’t go up there and get invisible by 
yourself again. I mean it. You’ve got to wait till someone else is around. 
Promise?” I squeezed his shoulders hard. 

“Okay, okay,” he said, trying to squirm away. “I promise.” 



I looked down. He had his fingers crossed on both hands. 


Erin called me later that night. It was about eleven. I was in my pajamas, reading 
a book in bed, thinking about going downstairs and begging my parents to let me 
stay up and watch Saturday Night Live. 

Erin sounded really excited. She didn’t even say hello. Just started talking a 
mile a minute in that squeaky mouse voice, so fast I had trouble understanding 
her. 

“What about the science fair?” I asked, holding the phone away from my 
ear, hoping that would help me understand her better. 

“The winning project,” Erin said breathlessly. “The prize is a silver trophy 
and a gift certificate at Video World. Remember?” 

“Yeah. So?” I still wasn’t following her. I think I was sleepier than I’d 
thought. It had been a nervous, tiring day, after all. 

“Well, what if you brought the mirror to school?” Erin asked excitedly. 
“You know. I would make you go invisible. Then I’d bring you back, and I’d get 
invisible. That could be our project.” 

“But, Erin—” I started to protest. 

“We’d win!” she interrupted. “We’d have to win! I mean, what else could 
beat it? We’d win first prize. And we’d be famous!” 

“Whoa!” I cried. “Famous?” 

“Of course. Famous!” she exclaimed. “Our picture would be in People 
magazine and everything!” 

“Erin, I’m not so sure about this,” I said softly, thinking hard. 

“Huh? Not so sure about what?” 

“Not so sure I want to be famous,” I replied. “I mean, I really don’t know if 
I want the whole world to know about the mirror.” 

“Why not?” she demanded impatiently. “Everyone wants to be famous. And 
rich.” 

“But they’ll take away the mirror,” I explained. “It’s an amazing thing, Erin. 
I mean, is it magic? Is it electronic? Is it someone’s invention? Whatever it is, 
it’s unbelievable! And they’re not going to let a kid keep it.” 

“But it’s yours\” she insisted. 

“They’ll take it away to study it. Scientists will want it. Government guys 
will want it. Army guys. They’ll probably want to use it to make the army 
invisible or something.” 



“Scary,” Erin mumbled thoughtfully. 

“Yeah. Scary,” I said. “So I don’t know. I’ve got to think about this. A lot. 
In the meantime, it’s got to be a secret.” 

“Yeah, I guess,” she said doubtfully. “But think about the science fair, Max. 
We could win the prize. We really could.” 

“I’ll think about it,” I told her. 

I haven’t thought about anything else! I realized. 

“April wants to try it,” she said. 

“Huh?” 

“I convinced her. I told her it didn’t hurt or anything. So she wants to try it 
on Wednesday. We are going to do it on Wednesday, aren’t we, Max?” 

“I guess,” I replied reluctantly. “Since everyone wants to.” 

“Great!” she exclaimed. “I think I’ll beat your record.” 

“The new record is ten minutes,” I informed her. I explained about Lefty 
and his dinnertime adventure. 

“Your brother is really a nut,” Erin remarked. 

I agreed with her, then said good night. 

I couldn’t get to sleep that night. I tried sleeping on one side, then the other. 
I tried counting sheep. Everything. 

I knew I was sleepy. But my heart was racing. I just couldn’t get 
comfortable. I stared up at the ceiling, thinking about the mirror in the little room 
above me. 

It was nearly three in the morning when I crept barefoot out of my room, 
wide awake, and headed up to the attic. As before, I leaned heavily on the 
banister as I climbed, trying to keep the wooden stairs from their usual 
symphony of creaks and groans. 

In my hurry to get to the little room, I stubbed my toe on the corner of a 
wooden crate. 

“Ow!” I screamed as quietly as possible. I wanted to hop up and down, but 
I forced myself to stand still, and waited for the pain to fade. 

As soon as I could walk again, I made my way into the little room. I pulled 
a carton in front of the mirror and sat down on it. 

My toe still throbbed, but I tried to ignore it. I stared at my dark reflection 
in the mirror, studying my hair first, of course. It was totally messed up, but I 
really didn’t care. 

Then I peered beyond my reflection, behind it. I guess I was trying to look 



deep into the glass. I don’t really know what I was doing or why I was up there. 

I was so tired and pumped up at the same time, so curious and confused, 
sleepy and nervous. 

I ran a hand along the glass, surprised again at how cool it felt in the hot, 
nearly airless little room. I pushed my open hand against the glass, then pulled it 
away. It left no handprint. 

I moved my hand to the wooden frame, once again rubbing the smooth 
wood. I stood up and slowly walked around to the back of the mirror. It was too 
dark back here to really examine it carefully. But there wasn’t anything to 
examine. The back of the frame was smooth, plain, and uninteresting. 

I came back around to the front and gazed up at the light. It looked like an 
ordinary lamp. Nothing at all special about it. The bulb was an odd shape, long 
and very thin. But it looked like an ordinary light bulb. 

Sitting back down on the carton, I rested my head in my hands and stared 
drowsily into the mirror. I yawned silently. 

I knew I should go back downstairs and go to sleep. Mom and Dad were 
going to wake us up early the next morning to drive to Springfield. 

But something was holding me there. 

My curiosity, I guess. 

I don’t know how long I sat there, still as a statue, watching my own 
unmoving reflection. It may have been just a minute or two. Or it might have 
been half an hour. 

But after a while, as I stared into the mirror, the reflection seemed to lose its 
sharpness. Now I found myself staring at vague shapes, blurred colors, 
deepening shadows. 

And then I heard the soft whisper. 

“Maaaaaaaax. ” 

Like the wind through the trees. The hushed shaking of leaves. 

Not a voice at all. Not even a whisper. 

Just the hint of a whisper. 

“Maaaaaaaaax. ” 

At first, I thought it was inside my own head. 

So faint. So soft. But so near. 

I held my breath, listened hard. 

Silence now. 

So it was inside my head, I told myself. I was imagining it. 



I took a deep breath, let it out slowly. 

“Maaaaax. ” 

Again, the whisper. 

Louder this time. Sad, somehow. Almost a plea. A call for help. From far, 
far away. 

“Maaaaaaaax. ” 

I raised my hands to my ears. Was I trying to shut it out? To see if I could 
make it go away? 

Inside the mirror, the dark reflected shapes shifted slowly. I stared back at 
myself, my expression tense, frightened. I realized I was chilled from head to 
foot. My whole body shivered from the cold. 

“Maaaaax. ” 

The whisper, I realized, was coming from the mirror. 

From my own reflection? From somewhere behind my reflection? 

I leapt to my feet, turned away, and ran. My bare feet slapped against the 
hardwood floor. I plunged down the stairs, flew across the hall, dived into my 
bed. 

I shut my eyes tight and prayed the frightening whisper wouldn’t follow 


me. 



16 


I pulled the covers up to my chin. I felt so cold. My entire body was trembling. 

I was breathing hard, gripping the top of the blanket with both hands, 
waiting, listening. 

Would the whispers follow me into my room? Were they real, or only in my 
head? 

Who was calling to me, whispering my name in that sad, desperate voice? 

Suddenly I heard panting louder than mine. I felt hot breath on my face. 
Sour-smelling and moist. 

It reached for me. It grabbed my face. 

I opened my eyes in terror. 

“Whitey!” I cried. 

The dumb dog was standing on his hind paws, leaning over the blanket, 
furiously licking my face. 

“Whitey, good dog!” I cried, laughing. His scratchy tongue tickled. I was 
never so glad to see him. 

I hugged him and pulled him up into the bed. He whimpered excitedly. His 
tail was wagging like crazy. 

“Whitey, what’s got you so worked up?” I asked, hugging him. “Do you 
hear voices, too?” 

He uttered a low bark, as if answering the question. Then he hopped off the 
bed and shook himself. He turned three times in a tight circle, making a place for 
himself on the carpet, and lay down, yawning loudly. 

“You’re definitely weird tonight,” I said. He curled himself into a tight ball 
and chewed softly on his tail. 

Accompanied by the dog’s gentle snores, I eventually drifted into a restless 
sleep. 

When I awoke, the morning sky outside my bedroom window was still 
gray. The window was open just a crack, and the curtains were swaying in a 
strong breeze. 

I sat up quickly, instantly alert. I have to stop going up to the attic, I 
thought. 

I have to forget about the stupid mirror. 



I stood up and stretched. I’ve got to stop. And I’ve got to get everyone else 
to stop. 

I thought of the whispered cry from the night before. The dry, sad voice, 
whispering my name. 

“Max!” 

The voice from outside my room startled me out of my chilling thoughts. 

“Max—time to wake up! We’re going to Springfield, remember?” It was 
my mom out in the hallway. “Hurry. Breakfast is on the table.” 

“I’m already up!” I shouted. “I’ll be down in a minute.” 

I heard her footsteps going down the stairs. Then I heard Whitey downstairs 
barking at the door to be let out. 

I stretched again. 

“Whoa!” I cried out as my closet door swung open. 

A red Gap T-shirt rose up off the top shelf and began to float across the 
room. 

I heard giggling. Familiar giggling. 

The T-shirt danced in front of me. 

“Lefty, you’re ridiculous!” I yelled angrily. I swiped at the T-shirt, but it 
danced out of my reach. “You promised you wouldn’t do this again!” 

“I had my fingers crossed,” he said, giggling. 

“I don’t care!” I cried. I lunged forward and grabbed the shirt. “You’ve got 
to stop. I mean it.” 

“I just wanted to surprise you,” he said, pretending his feelings were hurt. A 
pair of jeans floated up from the closet shelf and began to parade back and forth 
in front of me. 

“Lefty, I’m going to murder you!” I shouted. Then I lowered my voice, 
remembering that Mom and Dad might hear. “Put that down—now. Go upstairs 
and turn off the mirror light. Hurry!” 

I shook my fist at where the jeans were marching. I was so angry. 

Why did he have to be so dumb? Didn’t he realize that this wasn’t just a 
game? 

Suddenly, the jeans collapsed in a heap on the carpet. 

“Lefty, toss them to me,” I instructed him. “Then get upstairs and get 
yourself visible again.” 

Silence. 

The jeans didn’t move. 



“Lefty—don’t fool around,” I snapped, feeling a stab of dread in the pit of 
my stomach. “Toss me the jeans and get out of here.” 

No reply. 

The jeans remained crumpled on the carpet. 

“Stop this stupid game!” I screamed. “You’re not funny! So just stop it. 
Really. You’re scaring me!” 

I knew that’s what he wanted to hear. Once I admitted that he was scaring 
me, I was sure he’d giggle and go do as I said. 

But no. The room was still silent. The curtains fluttered toward me, then 
pulled back with a gentle rustling sound. The jeans lay crumpled on the carpet. 

“Lefty? Hey, Lefty?” I called, my voice trembling. No reply. 

“Lefty? Are you here?” No. Lefty was gone. 



17 


“Lefty?” My voice came out weak and trembling. 

He wasn’t there. It wasn’t a game. He was gone. 

Without thinking, I ran out of my room, down the hall, and up the stairs to 
the attic. My bare feet pounded on the steep wooden steps. My heart was 
pounding even louder. 

As I stepped into the heat of the attic, a wave of fear swept over me. 

What if Lefty had disappeared forever ? 

With a frightened cry, I lunged into the tiny room. 

The bright light reflected in the mirror shone into my eyes. 

Shielding my eyes with one hand, I made my way to the mirror and pulled 
the string. The light went out immediately. 

“Lefty?” I called anxiously. 

No reply. 

“Lefty? Are you up here? Can you hear me?” 

Fear clogged my throat. I was panting loudly, barely able to speak. 

“Lefty?” 

“Hi, Max. I’m here.” My brother’s voice came from right beside me. 

I was so happy to hear it, I turned and gave him a hug, even though I 
couldn’t see him. 

“I’m okay,” he said, startled by my emotion. “Really, Max. I’m okay.” 

It took a few minutes for him to reappear. 

“What happened?” I asked, checking him out, looking him up and down as 
if I hadn’t seen him for months. “You were clowning around in my room. Then 
you were gone.” 

“I’m fine,” he insisted with a shrug. 

“But where did you go?” I demanded. 

“Up here,” he repeated. 

“But Lefty—” Something about him looked different. I couldn’t quite put 
my finger on it. But staring at his face, I was sure that something was weird. 

“Stop staring at me like that, Max.” He shoved me away. “I’m fine. Really.” 
He started dancing away from me, heading to the stairs. 



“But, Lefty—” I followed him out of the room. 

“No more questions. Okay? I’m all right.” 

“Stay away from the mirror,” I said sternly. “Do you hear me?” 

He started down the stairs. 

“I mean it, Lefty. Don’t get invisible again.” 

“Okay, okay,” he snapped. “I won’t do it anymore.” 

I checked to make sure his fingers weren’t crossed. This time they weren’t. 

Mom was waiting for us in the hall. “So there you are,” she said 
impatiently. “Max, you’re not dressed!” 

“I’ll hurry,” I told her, and bolted into my room. 

“Lefty, what did you do to your hair?” I heard Mom ask my brother. “Did 
you brush it differently or something?” 

“No,” I heard Lefty reply. “It’s the same, Mom. Really. Maybe your eyes 
are different.” 

“Stop being such a smart mouth and get downstairs,” Mom told him. 

Something was definitely weird about Lefty. Mom had noticed it, too. But I 
couldn’t figure out what. 

As I picked my jeans up off the floor and pulled them on, I started to feel a 
little better. I had been so frightened, frightened that something terrible had 
happened to my brother. Frightened that he’d disappeared for good, and I’d 
never see him again. 

All because of that stupid mirror. 

All because it was such a thrill to get invisible. 

I suddenly thought about Erin, April, and Zack. 

They were so excited about Wednesday. About the big competition. Even 
April was going to get invisible this time. 

No, I thought. 

I have to call them. I have to tell them. 

I’ve really made up my mind. 

No more mirror. No more getting invisible. 

I’ll call all three of them when I get back from Springfield. And I’ll tell 
them the competition is cancelled. 

I sat down on my bed to tie my sneakers. 

Whew, I thought. That’s a load off my mind. 

And it was. Having decided not to use the mirror ever again made me feel 
much, much better. All of my fear seemed to float away. 



Little did I know that the most frightening time was still to come. 



18 


Imagine my surprise when Zack, Erin, and April showed up at my front door on 
Wednesday morning. 

“I told you guys the competition is off,” I sputtered, staring at them in 
astonishment through the screen door. 

“But Lefty called us,” Erin replied. “He said you changed your mind.” The 
other two agreed. 

My mouth dropped open to my knees. “Lefty?” 

They nodded. “He called us yesterday,” April said. 

“But Lefty isn’t even here this morning,” I told them as they marched into 
the house. “He’s at the playground playing softball with some of his friends.” 

“Who’s here?” my mom called. She came walking into the hallway, drying 
her hands on a dish towel. She recognized my friends, then turned to me, a 
bewildered look on her face. “Max, I thought you were going to help me down 
in the basement. I didn’t know you’d made plans with Zack, Erin, and April.” 

“I didn’t,” I replied weakly. “Lefty—” 

“We just dropped by,” Zack told Mom, coming to my rescue. 

“If you’re busy, Max, we can go,” Erin added. 

“No, that’s okay,” Mom told them. “Max was complaining about how 
boring it would be to help me. It’s good you three showed up.” 

She disappeared back into the kitchen. As soon as she was gone, my three 
friends practically pounced on me. 

“Upstairs!” Zack cried eagerly, pointing to the stairs. 

“Let’s get invisible!” Erin whispered. 

“I get to go first since I’ve never gone,” April said. 

I tried to argue with them, but I was outnumbered and outvoted. “Okay, 
okay,” I reluctantly agreed. I started to follow them up the stairs when I heard 
scratching noises at the door. 

I recognized the sound. It was Whitey, back from his morning walk. I 
pushed open the screen door and he trotted in, wagging his tail. 

The dumb dog had some burrs stuck to his tail. I chased him into the 
kitchen and managed to get him to stand still long enough to pull them off. Then 
I hurried up to the attic to join my friends. 



By the time I got up there, April was already standing in front of the mirror, 
and Zack was standing beside her, ready to pull the light on. 

“Whoa!” I called. 

They turned to look at me. I could see that April had a frightened 
expression on her face. “I have to do this right away. Or else I might wimp out,” 
she explained. 

“I just think we should get the rules straight first,” I said sternly. “This 
mirror really isn’t a toy, and—” 

“We know, we know,” Zack interrupted, grinning. “Come on, Max. No 
lectures today, okay? We know you’re nervous because you’re going to lose. But 
that’s no reason—” 

“I don’t want to compete,” April said nervously. “I just want to see what it’s 
like to be invisible. For just a minute. Then I want to come back.” 

“Well, I’m going for the world’s record,” Zack boasted, leaning against the 
mirror frame. 

“Me, too,” Erin said. 

“I really don’t think it’s a good idea,” I told them, staring at my reflection in 
the mirror. “We should just get invisible for a short time. It’s too dangerous to 

“What a wimp!” Zack declared, shaking his head. 

“We’ll be careful, Max,” Erin said. 

“I just have a really bad feeling,” I confessed. My hair was standing up in 
the back. I stepped closer to the mirror to see better, and smoothed it down with 
my hand. 

“I think we should all get invisible at the same time,” Zack said to me, his 
blue eyes lighting up with excitement. “Then we could go to the playground and 
scare your brother to death!” 

Everyone laughed except April. “I just want to try it for a minute,” she 
insisted. “That’s all.” 

“First we compete,” Erin told Zack. “Then we go out and scare people.” 

“Yeah! All rightl” Zack exclaimed. 

I decided to give up. There was no sense in trying to reason with Zack and 
Erin. They were too psyched for this competition. “Okay, let’s get it over with,” I 
told them. 

“But first I go,” April said, turning back to the mirror. 

Zack reached up for the string again. “Ready? On three,” he said. 



I turned to the door as Whitey came sniffing his way in, his nose lowered to 
the floor, his tail straight out behind him. 

“Whitey, what are you doing up here?” I asked. 

He ignored me and continued sniffing furiously. 

“One... two...” Zack started. 

“When I say ‘ready’, bring me back. Okay?” April asked, standing stiffly, 
staring straight ahead into the mirror. “No jokes or anything, Zack.” 

“No jokes,” Zack replied seriously. “As soon as you want to come back, I’ll 
turn off the light.” 

“Good,” April replied softly. 

Zack began his count again. “One... two... three!” 

As he said three and pulled the string, Whitey stepped up beside April. 

The light flashed on. 

“Whitey!” I screamed. “Stop!” 

But it was too late. 

With a yelp of surprise, the dog vanished along with April. 



19 


“The dog!” Erin screamed. 

“Hey—I’m gone! I’m invisible!” April exclaimed at the same time. 

I could hear Whitey whimpering. He sounded really frightened. 

“Pull the string!” I shouted to Zack. 

“Not yet!” April protested. 

“Pull it!” I insisted. 

Zack pulled the string. The light went out. April reappeared first, with an 
angry expression on her face. 

Whitey reappeared, and fell down. He jumped up quickly, but his legs were 
all wobbly. 

He looked so funny, we all started to laugh. 

“What’s going on up there?” My mom’s voice from the stairwell startled us 
into instant silence. “What are you doing?” 

“Nothing, Mom,” I answered quickly, signalling for my friends to remain 
silent. “Just hanging out.” 

“I don’t understand what’s so interesting up there in that dusty old attic,” 
she called up. 

I crossed my fingers, hoping she wouldn’t come upstairs to find out. 

“We just like it up here,” I replied. Pretty lame, but it was the only thing I 
could think of to say. 

Whitey, having recovered his balance, went running to the stairs. I heard the 
dog’s toenails click on the wooden stairs as he went down to join my mom. 

“That wasn’t fair,” April complained after Mom and Whitey were gone. “I 
didn’t get any time.” 

“I think we should get out of here,” I pleaded. “You see how unpredictable 
it is. You never know what’s going to happen.” 

“That’s sort of the fun of it,” Erin insisted. 

“I want another turn,” April said. 

We argued for about ten minutes. Once again, I lost. 

It was time to start the competition. Erin was going first. 

“Ten minutes is the time to beat,” Zack instmcted her. 



“No problem,” Erin said, making funny faces at herself in the mirror. “Ten 
minutes is too easy.” 

April had resumed her position, sitting on the floor with her back against 
the wall, studying her watch. We had agreed that she would take another turn 
after the competition was over. 

After it was over... 

Standing there watching Erin get ready, I wished it were over already. I felt 
cold all over. I had a heavy feeling of dread weighing me down. 

Please, please, I thought to myself, let everything go okay. 

Zack pulled the string. 

Erin disappeared in the flash of light. 

April studied her watch. 

Zack took a step back from the mirror and crossed his arms in front of his 
chest. His eyes glowed with excitement. 

“How do I look?” Erin teased. 

“You never looked better,” Zack joked. 

“I like what you did with your hair,” April teased, glancing up from the 
watch. 

Even April was joking and having a good time. Why couldn’t I relax, too? 
Why was I suddenly so frightened? 

“You feel okay?” I asked Erin. The words nearly caught in my throat. 

“Fine,” Erin replied. 

I could hear her footsteps as she walked around the room. 

“If you start to feel weird, just say ‘ready’, and Zack’ll pull the string,” I 

said. 

“I know,” she replied impatiently. “But I won’t be ready to come back until 
I break the record.” 

“I’m going next,” Zack told Erin, arms still crossed in front of him. “So 
your record won’t last for long.” 

Suddenly Zack’s arms uncrossed. His hands flew wildly up in the air, and 
he began slapping his face with both hands. 

“Ow! Cut it out, Erin!” he yelled, trying to squirm away. “Let go!” 

We heard Erin laugh as Zack slapped himself a few more times, then finally 
managed to wrestle out of her grip. 

“One minute,” April announced from behind us. 

“Ow! You hurt me!” Zack said, scowling and rubbing his red cheeks. 



Erin laughed again. 

“You still feel okay?” I asked, glancing into the mirror. 

“Fine. Stop worrying, Max,” Erin scolded. 

My T-shirt suddenly pulled up over my head. Erin laughed. 

“Give me a break!” I cried, spinning away. 

“Two minutes,” April announced. 

I heard the attic stairs creaking. A few seconds later, Whitey poked his head 
in. This time, he stopped in the doorway and peered into the room without 
entering. 

“Go back downstairs, boy,” I told him. “Go down.” 

He stared back at me as if considering my request. But he didn’t budge 
from the doorway. 

I didn’t want to take another chance of him getting too close to the mirror. 
So I grabbed him by the collar and guided him to the stairs. Then it took a while 
for the dumb dog to get the idea that he was supposed to go down the stairs! 

When I returned to the little room, April had just called out four minutes. 
Zack was pacing impatiently back and forth in front of the mirror. I guess he 
couldn’t wait for it to be his turn. 

I found myself thinking about Lefty. Lefty knew I had called everyone and 
canceled the competition. So why had he called Zack, Erin, and April and told 
them it was back on? 

Just one of his practical jokes, I decided. 

I’d have to find a way to pay him back for this. 

Something really evil... 

“Eight minutes,” April said, stretching. 

“Pretty good,” Zack told Erin. “Sure you don’t want to quit now? There’s 
no way you can win. Why not save everyone the time?” 

“Do you still feel okay?” I asked anxiously. 

No reply. 

“Erin?” I called, searching around as if I had a chance of spotting her. “You 
feel okay?” 

No reply. 

“Erin—don’t mess around. It’s not funny!” I cried. 

“Yeah. Answer us!” Zack demanded. 

Still no reply. 

Glancing into the mirror, I saw April’s reflection, caught her horrified 



expression. “Erin’s gone,” she uttered, her voice a frightened whisper. 



20 


“Erin—where are you?” I shouted. 

When she didn’t reply, I ran over to the string. Just as I grabbed it, I heard 
footsteps outside the room. A few seconds later, a can of Coke came floating 
through the door. 

“Miss me?” Erin asked playfully. 

“You scared us to death!” I cried, my voice squeaking. 

Erin laughed. “I didn’t know you cared.” 

“That wasn’t funny, Erin,” Zack said sternly. For once he was agreeing with 
me. “You really did scare us.” 

“I got thirsty,” Erin replied. The Coke can tilted up. We saw Coke start to 
pour out of it. The liquid abruptly disappeared as it flowed into Erin’s mouth. 

“I guess being invisible makes you really thirsty,” Erin explained. “So I 
slipped downstairs and got a Coke.” 

“But you should’ve told us,” April scolded, her eyes turned back to her 
watch. “Nine minutes.” 

“You shouldn’t go downstairs,” I added heatedly. “I mean, what if my mom 
saw you?” 

“Saw me?” 

“Well... you know what I mean,” I muttered. 

Erin laughed. I didn’t think it was funny. 

Why was I the only one taking this seriously? 

Erin beat Lefty’s record and kept going. When April called out twelve 
minutes, Zack asked Erin if she wanted to come back. 

No reply. 

“Erin? Are you goofing on us again?” I demanded. 

Still no reply. 

I could feel my throat tighten once again with fear. I walked over and pulled 
the string. My hand was shaking as I pulled it. I prayed silently to myself that 
Erin would return okay. 

The light went out. The three of us waited tensely for Erin to come back. 

After what seemed an endless wait, she shimmered back into view. She 



turned quickly away from the mirror, a triumphant smile on her face. “The new 
champ!” she declared, raising her fists in a gesture of victory. 

“You’re okay?” I asked, my feeling of fear refusing to leave. 

She nodded. “Just fine, worrywart.” She stepped away from the mirror, 
walking unsteadily. 

I stared at her. Something about her looked different. 

She looked perfectly okay. Not pale or sick-looking or anything. But 
something was different. Her smile? Her hair? I wished I could figure out what. 

“Max, pull the string.” Zack’s eager voice jerked me away from my 
thoughts. “Let’s go, man. I’m going for fifteen minutes.” 

“Okay. Get ready,” I said, glancing at Erin as I grabbed for the string. She 
flashed me a reassuring smile. 

But something about her smile was different. 

Something. 

But what? 

I pulled the string. Zack vanished in the flash of bright light. 

“Return of the Invisible Man!” he cried in a deep voice. 

“Not so loud,” I warned him. “My mom’ll hear you downstairs.” 

Erin had lowered herself to the floor beside April. I walked over and stood 
over her. “You sure you’re okay?” I asked. “You don’t feel dizzy or weird or 
anything?” 

She shook her head. “No. Really. Why don’t you believe me, Max?” 

As I stared down at her, I tried to figure out what was different about her 
appearance. What a mystery! I just couldn’t put my finger on it. 

“Well, how come you didn’t answer when I called you?” I demanded. 

“Huh?” Her face filled with surprise. “When?” 

“At about twelve minutes,” I told her. “I called you and Zack called you. 
But you didn’t answer us.” 

Erin’s expression turned thoughtful. “I guess I didn’t hear you,” she replied 
finally. “But I’m fine, Max. Really. I feel great. It was really awesome.” 

I joined them on the floor and leaned back against the wall to wait for 
Zack’s turn to be over. “I really mean it. Don’t turn off the light till fifteen 
minutes,” he reminded me. 

Then he messed up my hair, making it stand straight up in the air. 

Both girls laughed. 

I had to get up, walk over to the mirror, and comb it back down. I don’t 



know why people think messed-up hair is such a riot. I really don’t get it. 

“Hey, follow me. I’ve got an idea,” Zack said. His voice was coming from 
the doorway. 

“Whoa—hold on!” I called. But I could hear his sneakers clomping across 
the attic. 

“Follow me outside,” he called to us. We heard his footsteps on the attic 
stairs. 

“Zack—don’t do it,” I pleaded. “Whatever it is, don’t do it!” 

But there was no way he was going to listen to me. 

A few seconds later, we were out the back door, following our invisible 
friend toward our neighbor Mr. Evander’s back yard. 

This is going to be trouble, I thought unhappily. Big trouble. 

Erin, April, and I hid behind the hedge that separated our two yards. As 
usual, Mr. Evander was out in his tomato garden, stooped over, pulling up 
weeds, his big belly hanging out under his T-shirt, his red bald head shiny under 
the sun. 

What is Zack going to do? I wondered, holding my breath, my whole body 
heavy with dread. 

And then I saw three tomatoes float up from the ground. They hovered in 
the air, then floated closer to Mr. Evander. 

Oh, no, I thought, groaning silently to myself. 

Please, Zack. Please don’t do it. 

Erin, April, and I were huddled together behind the hedge, staring in 
disbelief as the three tomatoes began to circle each other rapidly in the air. 

Invisible Zack was juggling them. Showing off, as usual. He was always 
bragging about how he could juggle, and we couldn’t. 

It took a while for Mr. Evander to notice. 

But when he finally saw the three tomatoes spinning around in midair a few 
feet in front of him, his eyes bugged out and his face turned as red as the 
tomatoes! 

“Oh!” he cried. He let the weeds fall from his hands. And then he just 
stared at the spinning tomatoes, like he was frozen. 

Zack tossed the tomatoes higher as he juggled. 

April and Erin held hands over their mouths to stifle their laughter. They 
thought Zack’s stunt was a real hoot. But I just wanted to get Zack back up to the 
attic. 



“Hey, Mary! Mary!” Mr. Evander started calling to his wife. “Mary—come 
out here! You’ve got to see this! Mary!” 

A few seconds later, his wife came running across the yard, a frightened 
expression on her face. “Mike, what’s wrong? What’s wrong?” 

“Look—these tomatoes are twirling in the air!” Mr. Evander cried, 
motioning wildly for her to hurry. 

Zack let the tomatoes fall to the ground. 

“Where?” Mrs. Evander asked breathlessly, running as fast as she could. 

“There. Look!” Mr. Evander pointed. 

“I don’t see any tomatoes,” Mrs. Evander said, stopping in front of her 
husband, panting loudly. 

“Yes! They’re spinning. They’re—” 

“Those tomatoes?” Mrs. Evander asked, pointing to the three tomatoes on 
the ground. 

“Well... yes. They were twirling around, and—” Looking terribly confused, 
Mr. Evander scratched the back of his neck. 

“Mike, how long have you been out in the sun?” his wife scolded. “Didn’t I 
tell you to wear a cap?” 

“Uh... I’ll be in in a few minutes,” Mr. Evander said softly, staring down at 
the tomatoes. 

As soon as Mrs. Evander turned and headed back to the house, the three 
tomatoes floated up from the ground and began twirling in the air again. 

“Mary, look!” Mr. Evander shouted excitedly. “Look—quick! They’re 
doing it again!” 

Zack let the tomatoes drop to the ground. 

Mrs. Evander spun around and stared into empty space. “Mike, you’d better 
come with me —right now,” she insisted. She hurried back, grabbed Mr. Evander 
by the arm, and pulled him away. The poor man looked totally bewildered, 
staring at the tomatoes on the ground, still scratching the back of his neck as his 
wife pulled him to the house. 

“Hey, this is awesome!” Zack cried, right in front of me. 

Erin and April collapsed in wild giggles. I had to admit it was pretty funny. 
We laughed about it for a while. Then we sneaked back into the house and up to 
the attic. 

In the safety of the little room, we laughed some more about Zack’s 
juggling stunt. Zack bragged that he was the world’s first invisible juggler. 



Then, at twelve minutes, Zack suddenly stopped answering us. 

Just as Erin had. 

The three of us called his name over and over. 

Silence. 

Zack didn’t reply. 

“I’m going to bring him back,” I said, instantly gripped with fear once 
again. I ran to the string. 

“Wait,” Erin said, holding me back. 

“Huh? What for?” I pulled away from her. 

“He said to wait till fifteen minutes, remember?” she argued. 

“Erin, he’s completely disappeared!” I cried. 

“But he’ll be really mad,” Erin pleaded. 

“I say bring him back,” April said anxiously. 

“Give him until fifteen minutes,” Erin insisted. 

“No,” I said. I pulled the string. 

The light clicked off. 

A few minutes later, Zack flickered back. He smiled at us. “How long?” he 
asked, turning to April. 

“Thirteen minutes, twenty seconds,” she told him. 

His grin widened. “The new champ!” 

“You’re okay? You didn’t answer us,” I said, studying his face. 

“I’m fine. I didn’t hear you calling me. But I’m fine.” 

Zack looked different to me, too. Something was very different about him. 
But what? 

“What’s your problem, Max?” he demanded. “Why are you staring at me 
like I’m some kind of alien life-form or something?” 

“Your hair,” I said, studying him. “Was it like that before?” 

“Huh? What are you talking about? Are you freaking out or something?” 
Zack asked, rolling his eyes. 

“Was your hair like that before?” I repeated. “Buzzed real short on the right 
and then combed long to the left? Wasn’t it the other way around?” 

“You’re messed up, Max,” he said, grinning at Erin and April. “My hair is 
the same it’s always been. You’ve been staring in that mirror too long or 
something.” 

I could’ve sworn his hair had been short on the left, long on the right. But I 
guess Zack would know his own hair. 



“Are you going to go?” Erin asked, jumping up behind me. 

“Yeah, are you going to beat fifteen minutes?” Zack asked. 

I shook my head. “No, I really don’t feel like it,” I told them truthfully. 
“Let’s declare Zack the winner and get out of here.” 

“No way!” Zack and Erin declared in unison. 

“You’ve got to try,” Zack insisted. 

“Don’t wimp out, Max. You can beat Zack. I know you can,” Erin declared. 
She and Zack both pushed me up to the mirror. 

I tried to pull back. But they practically held me in place. 

“No. Really,” I said. “Zack can be the winner. I—” 

“Go for it, Max!” Erin urged. “I’m betting on you!” 

“Yeah. Go for it,” Zack repeated, his hand firmly on my shoulder. 

“No. Please—” I said. 

But Zack reached up with his free hand and pulled the string. 



21 


I stared into the mirror for a moment, waiting for the glare to fade from my eyes. 
It was always such a shock. That first moment, when your reflection 
disappeared. When you stared at the spot where you knew you were standing— 
and realized you were looking right through yourself! 

“How do you feel, Max? How do you feel?” Erin asked, imitating me. 

“Erin, what’s your problem?” I snapped. It wasn’t like her to be so 
sarcastic. 

“Just giving you a taste of your own medicine,” she replied, grinning. 

Something about her smile was lopsided, not normal. 

“Think you can beat my record?” Zack demanded. 

“I don’t know. Maybe,” I replied uncertainly. 

Zack stepped up to the mirror and studied his reflection. I had the strangest 
feeling as I watched him. I can’t really explain it. I’d never seen Zack stand in 
just that position and admire himself in just that way. 

Something was different. I knew it. But I couldn’t figure out what. 

Maybe it’s just my nervousness, I told myself. 

I’m just so stressed out. Maybe it’s affecting the way I look at my friends. 
Maybe I’m making all this up. 

“Two minutes,” April announced. 

“Are you just going to stand there?” Erin asked, staring into the mirror. 
“Aren’t you going to move around or anything, Max?” 

“No. I don’t think so,” I said. “I mean, I can’t think of anything I want to 
do. I’m just going to wait till the time is up.” 

“You want to quit now?” Zack asked, grinning at the spot where he thought 
I was standing. 

I shook my head. Then I remembered that no one could see it. “No. I might 
as well go the distance,” I told him. “Since I’m here, I might as well make you 
look bad, Zack.” 

He laughed scornfully. “You won’t beat thirteen-twenty,” he said 
confidently. “No way.” 

“Well, you know what?” I said, angered by his smug tone of voice. “I’m 
just going to stand here until I do.” 



And that’s what I did. I stood in place, leaning against the mirror frame, 
while April counted off the minutes. 

I did okay until a short while after she had called out eleven minutes. Then, 
suddenly, the glare of the light began to hurt my eyes. 

I closed my eyes, but it didn’t help. The light grew brighter, harsher. It 
seemed to sweep around me, surround me, fold over me. 

And then I began to feel dizzy and light. As if I were about to float away, 
even though I knew I was standing in place. 

“Hey, guys?” I called out. “I think I’ve had enough.” 

My voice sounded tiny and far away, even to me. 

The light swirled around me. I felt myself grow lighter, lighter, until I had 
to struggle to keep my feet on the floor to keep from floating away. 

I uttered a high-pitched cry. I was suddenly gripped by panic. 

Cold panic. 

“Zack—bring me back!” I shouted. 

“Okay, Max. No problem,” I heard Zack reply. 

He seemed miles and miles away. 

I struggled to see him through the blinding yellow light. He was a dark 
figure behind the wall of light, a dark figure moving quickly to the mirror. 

“I’m bringing you back now, Max. Hold on,” I heard Zack say. 

The bright light glowed even brighter. It hurt so much. Even with my eyes 
closed, it hurt. 

“Zack, pull the string!” I shouted. 

I opened my eyes to see his dim shadow reaching up to the string. 

Pull it, pull it, pull it! I urged silently. 

I knew that in a second, the light would go off. And I’d be safe. 

A second. 

One tug of the string. 

Pull it, pull it, pull it, Zack! 

Zack reached for the string. I saw him grab it. 

And then I heard another voice in the room. A new voice. A surprised 
voice. 

“Hi. What’s going on up here? What are you kids doing?” 

I saw the shadowy figure of Zack drop the string and step away without 
pulling it. 

My mom had burst into the room. 



22 


“Please—pull the string!” I called. 

No one seemed to hear me. 

“We’re just hanging out,” I heard Zack tell my mom. 

“But where’s Max?” I heard her ask. “How did you find this little room? 
What are you all doing in here?” Her voice sounded as if it were coming from 
underwater, far, far away. 

The entire room began to shimmer in the light, flickering on and off. I held 
on tightly to the frame of the mirror, struggling not to float away. 

“Can you hear me?” I called. “Please, somebody—pull the string! Bring me 
back!” 

They were just gray shadows in the wavering, rolling light. They didn’t 
seem to hear me. 

Gripping the frame tightly, I saw a shadow approach the mirror. My mom. 
She walked around it, admiring it. 

“I can’t believe we never knew about this room. Where did this old mirror 
come from?” I heard her ask. 

She was standing so close to me. They all were. 

They were so close and so far away at the same time. 

“Please bring me back!” I shouted. 

I listened for an answer. But the voices faded away. 

The shadows moved in a flickering blur. I tried to reach out to them, but 
they were too far away. 

I let go of the mirror frame and began to float. 

“Mom, I’m right here. Can’t you hear me? Can’t you do anything?” 

So light, so completely weightless, I floated in front of the mirror. 

My feet were off the floor. I couldn’t see them in the blinding glare. 

I floated to the mirror glass, under the light. 

I could feel the light pull me closer. Closer. 

Until it pulled me right into the mirror. 

I knew I was inside the mirror. Inside a glistening blur of colors. The shapes 
shimmered and rolled together as if underwater. 



And I floated through the glimmering shards of light and color, floated 
silently away from my friends, away from my mom, floated away from the tiny 
attic room. 

Into the center of the mirror. 

Into the center of an undulating, rolling world of twisting lights and colors. 

“Help me!” I cried. 

But my voice was muffled by the blurred, shifting colors. 

“Bring me back! Get me back!” 

Floating deeper into this glimmering world, I could barely hear myself. 

Deeper into the mirror. And still deeper. 

The colors gave way to shapes of gray and black. It was cold here. Cold as 
glass. 

And as I floated deeper, deeper, the grays and blacks faded, too. The world 
was white now. Pure white all around. Shadowless white as far as I could see. 

I stared straight ahead, no longer calling out, too frightened to call out, too 
mystified by the cold, ivory world I had entered. 

“Hello, Max,” a familiar voice said. 

“Ohh!” I cried out, realizing I was not alone. 



23 


A scream of terror escaped my lips. I tried to form words, but my brain seemed 
to be paralyzed. 

The figure approached quickly, silently, through the cold, white world of 
the mirror. He smiled at me, an eerie, familiar smile. 

“You!” I managed to scream. 

He stopped inches away from me. 

I stared at him in disbelief. 

I was staring at myself. Me. Smiling back at me. The smile as cold as the 
glass that surrounded us. 

“Don’t be afraid,” he said. “I’m your reflection.” 

“No!” 

His eyes —my eyes—studied me hungrily, like a dog staring at a meaty 
bone. His smile grew wider as I cried out my fear. 

“I’ve been waiting here for you,” my reflection said, his eyes locked on 
mine. 

“No!” I repeated. 

I turned away. 

I knew I had to get away. 

I started to run. 

But I stopped short when I saw the faces in front of me. Distorted, unhappy 
faces, dozens of them, fun house mirror faces, with enormous, drooping eyes, 
and tiny mouths tight with sadness. 

The faces seemed to hover just ahead of me. The gaping eyes staring at me, 
the tiny mouths moving rapidly as if calling to me, warning me, telling me to get 
away. 

Who were these people, these faces? 

Why were they inside the mirror with me? 

Why did their distorted, twisted images reveal so much sadness, so much 
pain? 

“No!” 

I gasped as I thought I recognized two of the floating faces, their mouths 



working furiously, their eyebrows rising wildly up and down. 

Erin and Zack? 

No. 

That was impossible, wasn’t it? 

I stared hard at them. Why were they talking so frantically? What were they 
trying to tell me? 

“Help me!” I called. But they didn’t seem to hear me. 

The faces, dozens of them, bobbed and floated. 

“Help me—please!” 

And then I felt myself being spun around. I stared into the eyes of my 
reflection as he gripped my shoulders and held me in place. 

“You’re not leaving,” he told me. His quiet voice echoed through the clear 
stillness, icicles scratching against glass. 

I struggled to free myself, but his grip was strong. 

“I’m the one to leave,” he told me. “I’ve been waiting so long. Ever since 
you turned on the light. And now I’m going to step out from here and join the 
others.” 

“Others?” I cried. 

“Your friends gave in easily,” he said. “They did not resist. The switch was 
made. And now you and I will also make a switch.” 

“No!” I screamed, and my cry seemed to echo through the icy cold for 
miles. 

“Why are you so afraid?” he asked, turning me around, still gripping my 
shoulders, bringing his face close to mine. “Are you so afraid of your other side, 
Max?” 

He stared at me intently. “That’s what I am, you know,” he said. “I am your 
reflection. Your other side. Your cold side. Don’t be afraid of me. Your friends 
were not afraid. They made the switch without much of a struggle. Now they are 
inside the mirror. And their reflections...” 

His voice trailed off. He didn’t have to finish his sentence. I knew what he 
was saying. 

Now I understood about Erin and Zack. Now I understood why they looked 
different to me. 

They were reversed. They were their own reflections. 

And now I understood why they pushed me into the mirror, why they 
forced me to disappear, too. 



If I didn’t do something, I realized, my reflection would switch places with 
me. My reflection would step into the attic. And I’d be trapped inside the mirror 
forever, trapped forever with the sad, bobbing faces. 

But what could I do? 

Staring at myself, I decided to stall, to ask questions, to give myself a little 
time to think. 

“Whose mirror is it? Who built it?” I demanded. 

He shrugged. “How should I know? I’m only your reflection, remember?” 

“But how—” 

“It’s time,” he said eagerly. “Don’t try to stall with foolish questions. Time 
to make the switch. Time for you to become my reflection!” 



24 


I pulled away. 

I started to run. 

The sad, distorted faces hovered in front of me. 

I shut my eyes and dodged away from them. 

I couldn’t think. Couldn’t breathe. 

My legs pumped. My arms flew out at my sides. It was so clear and bright, 
I couldn’t tell if I was moving or not. My feet couldn’t feel a floor. There were 
no walls, no ceiling. There was no air brushing my face as I ran. 

But my fear kept me moving. Through the clear, cold, shimmering light. 

He was behind me. 

I couldn’t hear him. 

He had no shadow. 

But I knew he was right behind me. 

And I knew that if he caught me, I’d be lost. Lost inside this blank world, 
unable to see, to hear, to smell, to touch anything, lost in the cold glass forever. 

Another silent, bobbing face. 

And so I kept running. 

Until the colors returned. 

Until light bent to form shapes. 

And I saw shadows moving and shifting in front of me. 

“Stop, Max!” I heard my reflection’s voice right behind me. “Stop right 
there!” 

But now he sounded worried. 

And so I kept running, running into the colors and moving shapes. 

Suddenly, Zack turned off the light. 

I came bursting out of the mirror, into the tiny attic room, into an explosion 
of sound, of color, of hard surfaces, of real things. The real world. 

I stood up, panting, gasping for breath. I tested my legs. I stomped on the 
floor. The solid floor. 

I turned my eyes to my friends, who were standing in front of me, startled 
expressions on their faces. My mom, I realized, must have retreated back 



downstairs. 

“Did you make the switch?” Zack asked eagerly, his eyes glowing with 
excitement. 

“Are you one of us?” Erin asked at the same time. 

“No,” said a voice—my voice—coming from just behind me. 

We all stared into the mirror. 

Inside it, my reflection, red-faced and angry, glared out at us, his hands 
pressed against the glass. “He got away,” my reflection told my friends. “The 
switch wasn’t made.” 

“I don’t understand!” I heard April cry. “What’s going on, guys?” 

Zack and Erin ignored her. They stepped up quickly and grabbed me by the 
arms. They spun me around roughly. 

“The switch wasn’t made,” my reflection repeated from inside the glass. 

“No problem,” Erin told it. 

She and Zack forced me up to the mirror. 

“You’re going back in, Max,” Zack said heatedly. 

He reached up and pulled the light cord. 



25 


The light flashed on. 

I went invisible. 

My reflection remained in the mirror, open palms pressed against the inside 
of the glass, staring out. 

“I’m waiting for you, Max,” he said. “In a few minutes, you’ll join me in 
here.” 

“No!” I shouted. “I’m leaving. I’m going downstairs.” 

“No, you’re not,” my reflection said, shaking his head. “Erin and Zack 
won’t let you escape. But don’t be so frightened, Max. It’s all quite painless. 
Really.” He smiled. It was my smile. But it was cold. Cruel. 

“I don’t get this,” April was protesting back by the door. “Will someone tell 
me what’s going on?” 

“You’ll see, April,” Erin told her soothingly. 

What am I going to do? I wondered, frozen in panic. 

What can I do? 

“Just a few more minutes,” my reflection said calmly, already celebrating 
his victory. His freedom. 

“April, get help!” I cried. 

She spun around at the sound of my voice. “Huh?” 

“Get help! Go downstairs. Get help! Hurry!” I screamed. 

“But—I don’t understand—” April hesitated. 

Erin and Zack moved to block her path. 

But the door suddenly swung open. 

I saw Lefty stop at the doorway. He peered in. Saw my reflection. 

He must have thought the reflection was me. 

“Think fast!” he shouted, and he tossed a softball. 

The ball smashed into the mirror. 

I saw the startled look on Lefty’s face. And then I heard the crash and saw 
the mirror crack and shatter. 

My reflection didn’t have time to react. He broke into shards of glass and 
fell to the floor. 



“Nooooo!” Erin and Zack shrieked. 

I popped back into view just as Erin’s and Zack’s reflections floated up off 
the floor. They were sucked into the broken mirror—screaming all the way— 
sucked into it as if a powerful vacuum cleaner were pulling them in. 

The two reflections flew screaming into the mirror and appeared to crack 
into hundreds of pieces. 

“Whoa!” Lefty cried, gripping the door with all his strength, pressing his 
body against the doorframe, struggling to keep himself from being sucked into 
the room. 

And then Erin and Zack dropped onto the floor on their knees, looking 
dazed and confused, staring at the pieces of shattered mirror that littered the 
floor around them. 

“You’re back!” I cried happily. “It’s really you!” 

“Yeah. It’s me,” Zack said, climbing unsteadily to his feet, then turning to 
help Erin up. 

The mirror was shattered. The reflections were gone. 

Erin and Zack gazed around the room, still shaken and dazed. 

April stared at me in total confusion. 

Lefty remained outside the doorway, shaking his head. “Max,” he said, 
“you should’ve caught the ball. That was an easy catch.” 

Erin and Zack were back. And they were okay. 

It didn’t take long to get everything back to normal. 

We explained everything to April and Lefty as best we could. 

April went home. She had to baby-sit her little sister. 

Erin and Zack—the real Erin and Zack—helped me sweep up the broken 
glass. Then we closed the door to the little room. I latched it tightly, and we all 
carried cartons over and stacked them up to block off the door. 

We knew we’d never go in there again. 

We vowed never to tell anyone about getting invisible or the mirror or what 
happened in that little room. Then Erin and Zack headed home. 

Later, Lefty and I were hanging around out in the back yard. “That was so 
scary,” I told Lefty with a shudder. “You just can’t imagine what it was like.” 

“Sounds pretty scary,” Lefty replied absently. He tossed his softball from 
hand to hand. “But at least everything is okay now. Want to play a little catch?” 

“No,” I shook my head. I wasn’t in the mood. But then I changed my mind. 
“Maybe it’ll take my mind off what happened this morning,” I said. 



Lefty tossed me the ball. We trotted behind the garage, our usual place for 
tossing the ball around. 

I lobbed it back to him. 

We were having a pretty good game of catch. 

Until about five minutes had gone by. 

Until... 

Until I stopped and froze in place. 

Were my eyes playing tricks on me? 

“Here comes my fastball,” he said. He heaved it at me. 

No. No. No. 

I gaped open-mouthed as the ball shot past me. 

I didn’t even try to catch it. I couldn’t move. 

I could only stare in horror. 

My brother was throwing right-handed. 


NIGHT OF THE 
LIVING DUMMY 
Goosebumps - 07 
R.L. Stine 




1 


“Mmmmm! Mmmm! Mmmmm!” 

Kris Powell struggled to get her twin sister’s attention. 

Lindy Powell glanced up from the book she was reading to see what 
the problem was. Instead of her sister’s pretty face, Lindy saw a round, pink 
bubble nearly the size of Kris’ head. 

“Nice one,” Lindy said without much enthusiasm. With a sudden 
move, she poked the bubble and popped it. 

“Hey!” Kris cried as the pink bubble gum exploded onto her cheeks 
and chin. 

Lindy laughed. “Gotcha.” 

Kris angrily grabbed Lindy’s paperback and slammed it shut. “Whoops 
—lost your place!” she exclaimed. She knew her sister hated to lose her 
place in a book. 

Lindy grabbed the book back with a scowl. Kris struggled to pull the 
pink gum off her face. 

“That was the biggest bubble I ever blew,” she said angrily. The gum 
wasn’t coming off her chin. 

“I’ve blown much bigger than that,” Lindy said with a superior sneer. 

“I don’t believe you two,” their mother muttered, making her way into 
their bedroom and dropping a neatly folded pile of laundry at the foot of 
Kris’ bed. “You even compete over bubble gum?” 

“We’re not competing,” Lindy muttered. She tossed back her blonde 
ponytail and returned her eyes to her book. 

Both girls had straight blonde hair. But Lindy kept hers long, usually 
tying it behind her head or on one side in a ponytail. And Kris had hers cut 
very short. 

It was a way for people to tell the twins apart, for they were nearly 
identical in every other way. Both had broad foreheads and round, blue 
eyes. Both had dimples in their cheeks when they smiled. Both blushed 
easily, large pink circles forming on their pale cheeks. 

Both thought their noses were a little too wide. Both wished they were 
a little taller. Lindy’s best friend, Alice, was nearly three inches taller, even 



though she hadn’t turned twelve yet. 

“Did I get it all off?” Kris asked, rubbing her chin, which was red and 
sticky. 

“Not all,” Lindy told her, glancing up. “There’s some in your hair.” 

“Oh, great,” Kris muttered. She grabbed at her hair, but couldn’t find 
any bubble gum. 

“Gotcha again,” Lindy said, laughing. “You’re too easy!” 

Kris uttered an angry growl. “Why are you always so mean to me?” 

“Me? Mean?” Lindy looked up in wide-eyed innocence. “I’m an angel. 
Ask anyone.” 

Exasperated, Kris turned back to her mother, who was stuffing socks 
into a dresser drawer. “Mom, when am I going to get my own room?” 

“On the Twelfth of Never,” Mrs. Powell replied, grinning. 

Kris groaned. “That’s what you always say.” 

Her mother shrugged. “You know we don’t have a spare inch, Kris.” 
She turned to the bedroom window. Bright sunlight streamed through the 
filmy curtains. “It’s a beautiful day. What are you two doing inside?” 

“Mom, we’re not little girls,” Lindy said, rolling her eyes. “We’re 
twelve. We’re too old to go out and play.” 

“Did I get it all?” Kris asked, still scraping pink patches of bubble gum 
off her chin. 

“Leave it. It improves your complexion,” Lindy told her. 

“I wish you girls would be nicer to each other,” Mrs. Powell said with 
a sigh. 

They suddenly heard shrill barking coming from downstairs. “What’s 
Barky excited about now?” Mrs. Powell fretted. The little black terrier was 
always barking about something. “Why not take Barky for a walk?” 

“Don’t feel like it,” Lindy muttered, nose in her book. 

“What about those beautiful new bikes you got for your birthdays?” 
Mrs. Powell said, hands on hips. “Those bikes you just couldn’t live 
without. You know, the ones that have been sitting in the garage since you 
got them.” 

“Okay, okay. You don’t have to be sarcastic, Mom,” Lindy said, 
closing her book. She stood up, stretched, and tossed the book onto her bed. 

“You want to?” Kris asked Lindy. 

“Want to what?” 



“Go for a bike ride. We could ride to the playground, see if anyone’s 
hanging out at school.” 

“You just want to see if Robby is there,” Lindy said, making a face. 

“So?” Kris said, blushing. 

“Go on. Get some fresh air,” Mrs. Powell urged. “I’ll see you later. I’m 
off to the supermarket.” 

Kris peered into the dresser mirror. She had gotten most of the gum 
off. She bmshed her short, hair back with both hands. “Come on. Let’s go 
out,” she said. “Last one out is a rotten egg.” She darted to the doorway, 
beating her sister by half a step. 

As they burst out the back door, with Barky yipping shrilly behind 
them, the afternoon sun was high in a cloudless sky. The air was still and 
dry. It felt more like summer than spring. 

Both girls were wearing shorts and sleeveless T-shirts. Lindy bent to 
pull open the garage door, then stopped. The house next door caught her 
eye. 

“Look—they’ve got the walls up,” she told Kris, pointing across their 
back yard. 

“That new house is going up so quickly. It’s amazing,” Kris said 
following her sister’s gaze. 

The builders had knocked down the old house during the winter. The 
new concrete foundation had been put down in March. Lindy and Kris had 
walked around on it when no workers were there, trying to figure out where 
the different rooms would go. 

And now the walls had been built. The construction suddenly looked 
like a real house, rising up in the midst of tall stacks of lumber, a big mound 
of red-brown dirt, a pile of concrete blocks, and an assortment of power 
saws, tools, and machinery. 

“No one’s working today,” Lindy said. 

They took a few steps toward the new house. “Who do you think will 
move in?” Kris wondered. “Maybe some great-looking guy our age. Maybe 
great-looking twin guys!” 

“Yuck!” Lindy made a disgusted face. “Twin guys? How drippy can 
you get! I can’t believe you and I are in the same family.” 

Kris was used to Lindy’s sarcasm. Both girls liked being twins and 
hated being twins at the same time. Because they shared nearly everything 



—their looks, their clothing, their room—they were closer than most sisters 
ever get. 

But because they were so much alike, they also managed to drive each 
other crazy a lot of the time. 

“No one’s around. Let’s check out the new house,” Lindy said. 

Kris followed her across the yard. A squirrel, halfway up the wide 
trunk of a maple tree, watched them warily. 

They made their way through an opening in the low shrubs that 
divided the two yards. Then, walking past the stacks of lumber and the tall 
mound of dirt, they climbed the concrete stoop. 

A sheet of heavy plastic had been nailed over the opening where the 
front door would go. Kris pulled one end of the plastic up, and they slipped 
into the house. 

It was dark and cool inside and had a fresh wood smell. The plaster 
walls were up but hadn’t been painted. 

“Careful,” Lindy warned. “Nails.” She pointed to the large nails 
scattered over the floor. “If you step on one, you’ll get lockjaw and die.” 

“You wish,” Kris said. 

“I don’t want you to die,” Lindy replied. “Just get lockjaw.” She 
snickered. 

“Ha-ha,” Kris said sarcastically. “This must be the living room,” she 
said, making her way carefully across the front room to the fireplace against 
the back wall. 

“A cathedral ceiling,” Lindy said, staring up at the dark, exposed 
wooden beams above their heads. “Neat.” 

“This is bigger than our living room,” Kris remarked, peering out the 
large picture window to the street. 

“It smells great,” Lindy said, taking a deep breath. “All the sawdust. It 
smells so piney.” 

They made their way through the hall and explored the kitchen. “Are 
those wires on?” Kris asked, pointing to a cluster of black electrical wires 
suspended from the ceiling beams. 

“Why don’t you touch one and find out?” Lindy suggested. 

“You first,” Kris shot back. 

“The kitchen isn’t very big,” Lindy said, bending down to stare into 
the holes where the kitchen cabinets would go. 



She stood up and was about to suggest they check out the upstairs 
when she heard a sound. “Huh?” Her eyes widened in surprise. “Is someone 
in here?” 

Kris froze in the middle of the kitchen. 

They both listened. 

Silence. 

Then they heard soft, rapid footsteps. Close by. Inside the house. 

“Let’s go!” Lindy whispered. 

Kris was already ducking under the plastic, heading out the doorway 
opening. She leapt off the back stoop and started running toward their back 
yard. 

Lindy stopped at the bottom of the stoop and turned back to the new 
house. “Hey—look!” she called. 

A squirrel came flying out a side window. It landed on the dirt with all 
four feet moving and scrambled toward the maple tree in the Powells’ yard. 

Lindy laughed. “Just a dumb squirrel.” 

Kris stopped near the low shrubs. “You sure?” She hesitated, watching 
the windows of the new house. “That was a pretty loud squirrel.” 

When she turned back from the house, she was surprised to find that 
Lindy had disappeared. 

“Hey—where’d you go?” 

“Over here,” Lindy called. “I see something!” 

It took Kris a while to locate her sister. Lindy was half-hidden behind a 
large black trash Dumpster at the far end of the yard. 

Kris shielded her eyes with one hand to see better. Lindy was bent over 
the side of the Dumpster. She appeared to be rummaging through some 
trash. 

“What’s in there?” Kris called. 

Lindy was tossing things around and didn’t seem to hear her. 

“What is it?” Kris called, taking a few reluctant steps toward the 
Dumpster. 

Lindy didn’t reply. 

Then, slowly, she pulled something out. She started to hold it up. Its 
arms and legs dangled down limply. Kris could see a head with brown hair. 

A head? Arms and legs? 

“Oh, no!” Kris cried aloud, raising her hands to her face in horror.

A child? 

Kris uttered a silent gasp, staring in horror as Lindy lifted him out of 
the trash Dumpster. 

She could see his face, frozen in a wide-eyed stare. His brown hair 
stood stiffly on top of his head. He seemed to be wearing some sort of gray 
suit. 

His arms and legs dangled lifelessly. 

“Lindy!” Kris called, her throat tight with fear. “Is it—is he... alive?” 

Her heart pounding, Kris started to run to her sister. Lindy was 
cradling the poor thing in her arms. 

“Is he alive?” Kris repeated breathlessly. 

She stopped short when her sister started to laugh. 

“No. Not alive!” Lindy called gleefully. 

And then Kris realized that it wasn’t a child after all. “A dummy!” she 
shrieked. 

Lindy held it up. “A ventriloquist’s dummy,” she said. “Someone 
threw him out. Do you believe it? He’s in perfect shape.” 

It took Lindy a while to notice that Kris was breathing hard, her face 
bright red. “Kris, what’s your problem? Oh, wow. Did you think he was a 
real kid?” Lindy laughed scornfully. 

“No. Of course not,” Kris insisted. 

Lindy held the dummy up and examined his back, looking for the 
string to pull to make his mouth move. “I am a real kid!” Lindy made him 
say. She was speaking in a high-pitched voice through gritted teeth, trying 
not to move her lips. 

“Dumb,” Kris said, rolling her eyes. 

“I am not dumb. You’re dumb!” Lindy made the dummy say in a high, 
squeaky voice. When she pulled the string in his back, the wooden lips 
moved up and down, clicking as they moved. She moved her hand up his 
back and found the control to make his painted eyes shift from side to side. 

“He’s probably filled with bugs,” Kris said, making a disgusted face. 
“Throw him back, Lindy.” 



“No way,” Lindy insisted, rubbing her hand tenderly over the dummy’s 
wooden hair. “I’m keeping him.” 

“She’s keeping me,” she made the dummy say. 

Kris stared suspiciously at the dummy. His brown hair was painted on 
his head. His blue eyes moved only from side to side and couldn’t blink. He 
had bright red painted lips, curved up into an eerie smile. The lower lip had 
a chip on one side so that it didn’t quite match the upper lip. 

The dummy wore a gray, double-breasted suit over a white shirt collar. 
The collar wasn’t attached to a shirt. Instead, the dummy’s wooden chest 
was painted white. Big brown leather shoes were attached to the ends of his 
thin, dangling legs. 

“My name is Slappy,” Lindy made the dummy say, moving his 
grinning mouth up and down. 

“Dumb,” Kris repeated, shaking her head. “Why Slappy?” 

“Come over here and I’ll slap you!” Lindy made him say, trying not to 
move her lips. 

Kris groaned. “Are we going to ride our bikes to the playground or 
not, Lindy?” 

“Afraid poor Robby misses you?” Lindy made Slappy ask. 

“Put that ugly thing down,” Kris replied impatiently. 

“I’m not ugly,” Slappy said in Lindy’s squeaky voice, sliding his eyes 
from side to side. “You’re ugly!” 

“Your lips are moving,” Kris told Lindy. “You’re a lousy 
ventriloquist.” 

“I’ll get better,” Lindy insisted. 

“You mean you’re really keeping it?” Kris cried. 

“I like Slappy. He’s cute,” Lindy said, cuddling the dummy against the 
front of her T-shirt. 

“I’m cute,” she made him say. “And you’re ugly.” 

“Shut up,” Kris snapped to the dummy. 

“You shut up!” Slappy replied in Lindy’s tight, high-pitched voice. 

“What do you want to keep him for?” Kris asked, following her sister 
toward the street. 

“I always liked puppets,” Lindy recalled. “Remember those 
marionettes I used to have? I played with them for hours at a time. I made 
up long plays with them.” 



“I always played with the marionettes, too,” Kris remembered. 

“You got the strings all tangled up,” Lindy said, frowning. “You 
weren’t any good at it.” 

“But what are you going to do with this dummy?” Kris demanded. 

“I don’t know. Maybe I’ll work up an act,” Lindy said thoughtfully, 
shifting Slappy to her other arm. “I’ll bet I could earn some money with 
him. You know. Appear at kids’ birthday parties. Put on shows.” 

“Happy birthday!” she made Slappy declare. “Hand over some 
money!” 

Kris didn’t laugh. 

The two girls walked along the street in front of their house. Lindy 
cradled Slappy in her arms, one hand up his back. 

“I think he’s creepy,” Kris said, kicking a large pebble across the 
street. “You should put him back in the Dumpster.” 

“No way,” Lindy insisted. 

“No way,” she made Slappy say, shaking his head, his glassy blue eyes 
moving from side to side. “I’ll put you in the Dumpster!” 

“Slappy sure is mean,” Kris remarked, frowning at Lindy. 

Lindy laughed. “Don’t look at me,” she teased. “Complain to Slappy.” 

Kris scowled. 

“You’re jealous,” Lindy said. “Because I found him and you didn’t.” 

Kris started to protest, but they both heard voices. Kris looked up to 
see the two Marshall kids from down the block running toward them. They 
were cute, red-headed kids that Lindy and Kris sometimes baby-sat for. 

“What’s that?” Amy Marshall asked, pointing at Slappy. 

“Does he talk?” her younger brother, Ben, asked, staying several feet 
away, an uncertain expression on his freckled face. 

“Hi, I’m Slappy!” Lindy made the dummy call out. She cradled Slappy 
in one arm, making him sit up straight, his arms dangling at his sides. 

“Where’d you get him?” Amy asked. 

“Do his eyes move?” Ben asked, still hanging back. 

“Do your eyes move?” Slappy asked Ben. 

Both Marshall kids laughed. Ben forgot his reluctance. He stepped up 
and grabbed Slappy’s hand. 

“Ouch! Not so hard!” Slappy cried. 

Ben dropped the hand with a gasp. Then he and Amy collapsed in 



gleeful laughter. 

“Ha-ha-ha-ha!” Lindy made Slappy laugh, tilting his head back and 
opening his mouth wide. 

The two kids thought that was a riot. They laughed even harder. 

Pleased by the response she was getting, Lindy glanced at her sister. 
Kris was sitting on the curb, cradling her head in her hands, a dejected look 
on her face. 

She’s jealous, Lindy realized. Kris sees that the kids really like Slappy 
and that I’m getting all the attention. And she’s totally jealous. 

I’m definitely keeping Slappy! Lindy told herself, secretly pleased at 
her little triumph. 

She stared into the dummy’s bright blue painted eyes. To her surprise, 
the dummy seemed to be staring back at her, a twinkle of sunlight in his 
eyes, his grin wide and knowing.

“Who was that on the phone?” Mr. Powell asked, shoveling another forkful 
of spaghetti into his mouth. 

Lindy slipped back into her place at the table. “It was Mrs. Marshall. 
Down the block.” 

“Does she want you to baby-sit?” Mrs. Powell asked, reaching for the 
salad bowl. She turned to Kris. “Don’t you want any salad?” 

Kris wiped spaghetti sauce off her chin with her napkin. “Maybe 
later.” 

“No,” Lindy answered. “She wants me to perform. At Amy’s birthday 
party. With Slappy.” 

“Your first job,” Mr. Powell said, a smile crossing his slender face. 

“Amy and Ben liked Slappy so much, they insisted on him,” Lindy 
said. “Mrs. Marshall is going to pay me twenty dollars.” 

“That’s great!” their mother exclaimed. She passed the salad bowl 
across the table to her husband. 

It had been a week since Lindy rescued Slappy from the trash 
Dumpster. Every day after school, she had spent hours up in her room 
rehearsing with him, working on his voice, practicing not moving her lips, 
thinking up jokes to perform with him. 

Kris kept insisting the whole thing was dumb. “I can’t believe you’re 
being such a nerd,” she told her sister. She refused to be an audience for 
Lindy’s routines. 

But when Lindy brought Slappy into school on Friday, Kris’ attitude 
began to change. A group of kids had gathered around Lindy outside her 
locker. 

As Lindy made Slappy talk for them, Kris watched from down the 
hall. She’s going to make a total fool of herself, Kris thought. 

But to her surprise, the kids hooted and howled. They thought Slappy 
was a riot. Even Robby Martin, the guy Kris had had a crush on for two 
years, thought Lindy was terrific. 

Watching Robby laugh along with the other kids made Kris think hard. 
Becoming a ventriloquist might be fun. 



And profitable. Lindy was going to earn twenty dollars at the 
Marshalls’ birthday party. And when word got around, she’d probably 
perform at a lot of parties and earn even more money. 

After dinner that evening, Lindy and Kris washed and dried the dishes. 
Then Lindy asked her parents if she could practice her new comedy routine 
on them. She hurried up to her room to get Slappy. 

Mr. and Mrs. Powell took a seat on the living room couch. “Maybe 
Lindy will be a TV star,” Mrs. Powell said. 

“Maybe,” Mr. Powell agreed, settling back on the couch, a pleased 
smile on his face. Barky yapped and climbed between Mr. and Mrs. Powell, 
his tiny stub of a tail wagging furiously. 

“You know you’re not allowed on the couch,” Mrs. Powell said, 
sighing. But she made no move to push Barky off. 

Kris sat down away from the others, on the floor by the steps, cradling 
her chin in her hands. 

“You’re looking glum this evening,” her father remarked. 

“Can I get a dummy, too?” Kris asked. She hadn’t really planned to 
say it. The question just popped out of her mouth. 

Lindy came back into the room, carrying Slappy around the waist. 
“Ready?” she asked. She pulled a dining room chair into the center of the 
living room and sat down on it. 

“Well, can I?” Kris repeated. 

“You really want one, too?” Mrs. Powell asked, surprised. 

“Want what?” Lindy asked, confused. 

“Kris says she wants a dummy, too,” Mrs. Powell reported. 

“No way,” Lindy said heatedly. “Why do you want to be such a 
copycat?” 

“It looks like fun,” Kris replied, her cheeks turning bright pink. “If you 
can do it, I can do it, too,” she added shrilly. 

“You always copy everything I do,” Lindy protested angrily. “Why 
don’t you find something of your own for once? Go upstairs and work on 
your junk jewelry collection. That’s your hobby. Let me be the 
ventriloquist.” 

“Girls”—Mr. Powell started, raising a hand for quiet—“please, don’t 
fight over a dummy.” 

“I really think I’d be better at it,” Kris said. “I mean, Lindy isn’t very 



funny.” 

“Everyone thinks I’m funny,” Lindy insisted. 

“That’s not very nice, Kris,” Mrs. Powell scolded. 

“Well, I just think if Lindy has one, I should be able to have one, too,” 
Kris said to her parents. 

“Copycat,” Lindy repeated, shaking her head. “You’ve been putting 
me down all week. You said it was nerdy. But I know why you changed 
your mind. You’re upset because I’m going to earn some money and you’re 
not.” 

“I really wish you two wouldn’t argue about everything,” Mr. Powell 
said disgustedly. 

“Well, can I have a dummy?” Kris asked him. 

“They’re expensive,” Mr. Powell replied, glancing at his wife. “A good 
one will cost more than a hundred dollars. I really don’t think we can afford 
to buy one now.” 

“Why don’t you both share Slappy?” Mrs. Powell suggested. 

“Huh?” Lindy’s mouth dropped open in protest. 

“You two always share everything,” Mrs. Powell continued. “So why 
don’t you share Slappy?” 

“But, Mom—” Lindy whined unhappily. 

“Excellent idea,” Mr. Powell interrupted. He motioned to Kris. “Try it 
out. After you share him for a while, I’m sure one of you will lose interest 
in him. Maybe even both of you.” 

Kris climbed to her feet and walked over to Lindy. She reached out for 
the dummy. “I don’t mind sharing,” she said quietly, searching her sister’s 
eyes for approval of the idea. “Can I hold him for just a second?” 

Lindy held onto Slappy tightly. 

Suddenly the dummy’s head tilted back and his mouth opened wide. 
“Beat it, Kris!” he snarled in a harsh raspy voice. “Get lost, you stupid 
moron!” 

Before Kris could back away, Slappy’s wooden hand shot up, and he 
slapped her hard across the face. 



4 


“Ow!” 

Kris screamed and raised her hand to her cheek, which was bright 
pink. She stepped back. “Stop it, Lindy! That hurt!” 

“Me?” Lindy cried. “I didn’t do it! Slappy did!” 

“Don’t be dumb,” Kris protested, rubbing her cheek. “You really hurt 

me.” 

“But I didn’t do it!” Lindy cried. She turned Slappy’s face toward her. 
“Why were you so rude to Kris?” 

Mr. Powell jumped up from the couch. “Stop acting dumb and 
apologize to your sister,” he ordered. 

Lindy bowed Slappy’s head. “I’m sorry,” she made the dummy say. 

“No. In your own voice,” Mr. Powell insisted, crossing his arms in 
front of his chest. “Slappy didn’t hurt Kris. You did.” 

“Okay, okay,” Lindy muttered, blushing. She avoided Kris’ angry 
stare. “I’m sorry. Here.” She dumped Slappy into Kris’ arms. 

Kris was so surprised, she nearly dropped the dummy. Slappy was 
heavier than she’d imagined. 

“Now what am I supposed to do with him?” Kris asked Lindy. 

Lindy shrugged and crossed the room to the couch, where she dropped 
down beside her mother. 

“Why’d you make such a fuss?” Mrs. Powell whispered, leaning close 
to Lindy. “That was so babyish.” 

Lindy blushed. “Slappy is mine! Why can’t something be mine for 
once?” 

“Sometimes you girls are so nice to each other, and sometimes...” 
Mrs. Powell’s voice trailed off. 

Mr. Powell took a seat on the padded arm of the chair across the room. 

“How do I make his mouth work?” Kris asked, tilting the dummy 
upside down to examine its back. 

“There’s a string in his back, inside the slit in his jacket,” Lindy told 
her grudgingly. “You just pull it.” 

I don’t want Kris to work Slappy, Lindy thought unhappily. 



I don’t want to share Slappy. 

Why can’t I have something that just belongs to me? Why do I have to 
share everything with her? 

Why does Kris always want to copy me? 

She gritted her teeth and waited for her anger to fade. 

Later that night, Kris sat straight up in bed. She’d had a bad dream. 

I was being chased, she remembered, her heart still pounding. Chased 
by what? By whom? 

She couldn’t remember. 

She glanced around the shadowy room, waiting for her heartbeat to 
return to normal. The room felt hot and stuffy, even though the window was 
open and the curtains were fluttering. 

Lindy lay sound asleep on her side in the twin bed next to Kris’. She 
was snoring softly, her lips slightly parted, her long hair falling loose about 
her face. 

Kris glanced at the clock-radio on the bed table between the two twin 
beds. It was nearly three in the morning. 

Even though she was now wide awake, the nightmare wouldn’t 
completely fade away. She still felt uncomfortable, a little frightened, as if 
she were still being chased by someone or something. The back of her neck 
felt hot and prickly. 

She turned and fluffed up her pillow, propping it higher on the 
headboard. As she lay back on it, something caught her eye. 

Someone sitting in the chair in front of the bedroom window. Someone 
staring at her. 

After a sharp intake of breath, she realized it was Slappy. 

Yellow moonlight poured over him, making his staring eyes glow. He 
was sitting up in the chair, tilted to the right at a slight angle, one arm 
resting on the slender arm of the chair. 

His mouth locked in a wide, mocking grin, his eyes seemed to be 
staring right at Kris. 

Kris stared back, studying the dummy’s expression in the eerie yellow 
moonlight. Then, without thinking, without even realizing what she was 
doing, she climbed silently out of bed. 

Her foot got tangled in the bedsheet and she nearly tripped. Kicking 



the sheet away, she made her way quickly across the room to the window. 

Slappy stared up at her as her shadow fell over him. His grin seemed 
to grow wider as Kris leaned closer. 

A gust of wind made the soft curtains flutter against her face. Kris 
pushed them away and peered down at the dummy’s painted head. 

She reached a hand out and rubbed his wooden hair, shining in the 
moonlight. His head felt warm, warmer than she’d imagined. 

Kris quickly jerked her hand away. 

What was that sound? 

Had Slappy snickered? Had he laughed at her? 

No. Of course not. 

Kris realized she was breathing hard. 

Why am I so freaked out by this stupid dummy? she thought. 

In the bed behind her, Lindy made a gurgling sound and rolled onto 
her back. 

Kris stared hard into Slappy’s big eyes, gleaming in the light from the 
window. She waited for him to blink or to roll his eyes from side to side. 

She suddenly felt foolish. 

He’s just a stupid wooden dummy, she told herself. 

She reached out and pushed him over. 

The stiff body swung to the side. The hard head made a soft clonk as it 
hit the wooden arm of the chair. 

Kris stared down at him, feeling strangely satisfied, as if she’d 
somehow taught him a lesson. 

The curtains rustled against her face again. She pushed them away. 

Feeling sleepy, she started back to bed. 

She had only gone one step when Slappy reached up and grabbed her 
wrist. 



5 


“Oh!” As the hand tightened around her wrist, Kris cried out and spun 
around. 

To her surprise, Lindy was crouched beside her. Lindy had a tight grip 
on Kris’ wrist. 

Kris jerked her hand from Lindy’s grasp. 

Moonlight through the window lit up Lindy’s devilish grin. “Gotcha 
again!” she declared. 

“You didn’t scare me!” Kris insisted. But her voice came out a 
trembling whisper. 

“You jumped a mile!” Lindy exclaimed gleefully. “You really thought 
the dummy grabbed you.” 

“Did not!” Kris replied. She hurried to her bed. 

“What were you doing up, anyway?” Lindy demanded. “Were you 
messing with Slappy?” 

“No. I... uh... had a bad dream,” Kris told her. “I just went to look out 
the window.” 

Lindy snickered. “You should’ve seen the look on your face.” 

“I’m going back to sleep. Leave me alone,” Kris snapped. She pulled 
the covers up to her chin. 

Lindy pushed the dummy back to a sitting position. Then she returned 
to her bed, still chuckling over the scare she’d given her sister. 

Kris rearranged her pillows, then glanced across the room to the 
window. The dummy’s face was half covered in shadow now. But the eyes 
glowed as if he were alive. And they stared into hers as if they were trying 
to tell her something. 

Why does he have to grin like that? Kris asked herself, trying to rub 
away the prickly feeling on the back of her neck. 

She pulled up the sheet, settled into the bed, and turned on her side, 
away from the wide, staring eyes. 

But even with her back turned, she could feel them gazing at her. Even 
with her eyes closed and the covers pulled up to her head, she could picture 
the shadowy, distorted grin, the unblinking eyes. Staring at her. Staring. 



Staring. 

She drifted into an uncomfortable sleep, drifted into another dark 
nightmare. Someone was chasing her. Someone very evil was chasing her. 

But who? 

On Monday afternoon, Lindy and Kris both stayed after school to rehearse 
for the spring concert. It was nearly five when they arrived home, and they 
were surprised to see their dad’s car in the driveway. 

“You’re home so early!” Kris exclaimed, finding him in the kitchen 
helping their mother prepare dinner. 

“I’m leaving tomorrow for a sales conference in Portland,” Mr. Powell 
explained, peeling an onion over the sink with a small paring knife. “So I 
only worked half a day today.” 

“What’s for dinner?” Lindy asked. 

“Meatloaf,” Mrs. Powell replied, “if your father ever gets the onion 
peeled.” 

“There’s a trick to not crying when you peel an onion,” Mr. Powell 
said, tears rolling down his cheeks. “Wish I knew it.” 

“How was chorus rehearsal?” Mrs. Powell asked, kneading a big ball 
of red ground beef in her hands. 

“Boring,” Lindy complained, opening the refrigerator and taking out a 
can of Coke. 

“Yeah. We’re doing all these Russian and Yugoslavian songs,” Kris 
said. “They’re so sad. They’re all about sheep or something. We don’t 
really know what they’re about. There’s no translation.” 

Mr. Powell mshed to the sink and began splashing cold water on his 
red, runny eyes. “I can’t take this!” he wailed. He tossed the half-peeled 
onion back to his wife. 

“Crybaby,” she muttered, shaking her head. 

Kris headed up the stairs to drop her backpack in her room. She tossed 
it onto the desk she shared with Lindy, then turned to go back downstairs. 

But something by the window caught her eye. 

Spinning around, she gasped. 

“Oh, no!” The startled cry escaped her lips. 

Kris raised her hands to her cheeks and stared in disbelief. 

Slappy was propped up in the chair in front of the window, grinning at 



her with his usual wide-eyed stare. And seated beside him was another 
dummy, also grinning at her. 

And they were holding hands. 

“What’s going on here?” Kris cried aloud. 



6 


“Do you like him?” 

At first, Kris thought that Slappy had asked the question. 

She gaped in stunned disbelief. 

“Well? What do you think of him?” 

It took Kris a long moment to realize that the voice was coming from 
behind her. She turned to find her father standing in the doorway, still 
dabbing at his eyes with a wet dishtowel. 

“The—the new dummy?” Kris stammered. 

“He’s for you,” Mr. Powell said, stepping into the room, the wet towel 
pressed against both eyes. 

“Really?” Kris hurried over to the chair and picked the new dummy up 
to examine him. 

“There’s a tiny pawnshop on the corner across from my office,” Mr. 
Powell said, lowering the towel. “I was walking past and, believe it or not, 
this guy was in the window. He was cheap, too. I think the pawnbroker was 
glad to get rid of him.” 

“He’s... cute,” Kris said, searching for the right word. “He looks just 
like Lindy’s dummy, except his hair is bright red, not brown.” 

“Probably made by the same company,” Mr. Powell said. 

“His clothes are better than Slappy’s,” Kris said, holding the dummy 
out at arm’s length to get a good view. “I hate that stupid gray suit on 
Lindy’s dummy.” 

The new dummy wore blue denim jeans and a red-and-green flannel 
shirt. And instead of the formal-looking, shiny brown shoes, he had white 
high-top sneakers on his feet. 

“So you like him?” Mr. Powell asked, smiling. 

“I love him!” Kris cried happily. She crossed the room and gave her 
dad a hug. 

Then she picked up the dummy and ran out of the room, down the 
stairs, and into the kitchen. “Hey, everybody! Meet Mr. Wood!” she 
declared happily, holding the grinning dummy up in front of her. 

Barky yapped excitedly, leaping up to nip at the dummy’s sneakers. 



Kris pulled her dummy away. 

“Hey!” Lindy cried in surprise. “Where’d you get that?” 

“From Daddy,” Kris said, her grin wider than the dummy’s. “I’m going 
to start practicing with him after dinner, and I’m going to be a better 
ventriloquist than you.” 

“Kris!” Mrs. Powell scolded. “Everything isn’t a competition, you 
know!” 

“I already have a job with Slappy,” Lindy said with a superior sneer. 
“And you’re just getting started. You’re just a beginner.” 

“Mr. Wood is much better-looking than Slappy,” Kris said, mirroring 
her twin’s sneer. “Mr. Wood is cool-looking. That gray suit on your dummy 
is the pits.” 

“You think that ratty old shirt is cool-looking?” Lindy scoffed, making 
a disgusted face. “Yuck. That old dummy probably has worms!” 

“You have worms!” Kris exclaimed. 

“Your dummy won’t be funny,” Lindy said nastily, “because you don’t 
have a sense of humor.” 

“Oh, yeah?” Kris replied, tossing Mr. Wood over her shoulder. “I must 
have a sense of humor. I put up with you, don’t I?” 

“Copycat! Copycat!” Lindy cried angrily. 

“Out of the kitchen!” Mrs. Powell ordered with an impatient shriek. 
“Out! Get out! You two are impossible! The dummies have better 
personalities than either of you!” 

“Thanks, Mom,” Kris said sarcastically. 

“Call me for dinner,” Lindy called back. “I’m going upstairs to 
practice my act with Slappy for the birthday party on Saturday.” 

It was the next afternoon, and Kris was sitting at the dressing table she 
shared with Lindy. Kris rummaged in the jewelry box and pulled out 
another string of brightly colored beads. She slipped them over her head 
and untangled them from the other three strands of beads she was wearing. 
Then she gazed at herself in the mirror, shaking her head to better see the 
long, dangly earrings. 

I love my junk jewelry collection, she thought, digging into the depths 
of the wooden jewelry box to see what other treasures she could pull out. 

Lindy had no interest in the stuff. But Kris could spend hours trying on 



the beads, fingering the dozens of little charms, running her fingers over the 
plastic bracelets, jangling the earrings. Her jewelry collection always 
cheered her up. 

She shook her head again, making the long earrings jangle. A knock on 
the bedroom door made her spin around. 

“Hey, Kris, how’s it going?” Her friend Cody Matthews stepped into 
the room. He had straight, white-blond hair, and pale gray eyes in a slender, 
serious face. Cody always looked as if he were deep in thought. 

“You ride your bike over?” Kris asked, removing several strands of 
beads at once and tossing them into the jewelry box. 

“No. Walked,” Cody replied. “Why’d you call? You just want to hang 
out?” 

“No.” Kris jumped to her feet. She walked over to the chair by the 
window and grabbed up Mr. Wood. “I want to practice my act.” 

Cody groaned. “I’m the guinea pig?” 

“No. The audience. Come on.” 

She led him out to the bent old maple tree in the middle of her back 
yard. The afternoon sun was just beginning to lower itself in the clear, 
spring-blue sky. 

She raised one foot against the tree trunk and propped Mr. Wood on 
her knee. Cody sprawled on his back in the shade. “Tell me if this is funny,” 
she instructed. 

“Okay. Shoot,” Cody replied, narrowing his eyes in concentration. 

Kris turned Mr. Wood to face her. “How are you today?” she asked 

him. 

“Pretty good. Knock wood,” she made the dummy say. 

She waited for Cody to laugh, but he didn’t. “Was that funny?” she 
asked. 

“Kinda,” he replied without enthusiasm. “Keep going.” 

“Okay.” Kris lowered her head so that she was face-to-face with her 
dummy. “Mr. Wood,” she said, “why were you standing in front of the 
mirror with your eyes closed?” 

“Well,” answered the dummy in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, “I 
wanted to see what I look like when I’m asleep!” 

Kris tilted the dummy’s head back and made him look as if he were 
laughing. “How about that joke?” she asked Cody. 



Cody shrugged. “Better, I guess.” 

“Aw, you’re no help!” Kris screamed angrily. She lowered her arms, 
and Mr. Wood crumpled onto her lap. “You’re supposed to tell me if it’s 
funny or not.” 

“I guess not, ” Cody said thoughtfully. 

Kris groaned. “I need some good joke books,” she said. “That’s all. 
Some good joke books with some really funny jokes. Then I’d be ready to 
perform. Because I’m a pretty good ventriloquist, right?” 

“I guess,” Cody replied, pulling up a handful of grass and letting the 
moist, green blades sift through his fingers. 

“Well, I don’t move my lips very much, do I ?” Kris demanded. 

“Not too much,” Cody allowed. “But you don’t really throw your 
voice.” 

“No one can throw her voice,” Kris told him. “It’s just an illusion. You 
make people think you’re throwing your voice. You don’t really throw it.” 

“Oh,” Cody said, pulling up another handful of grass. 

Kris tried out several more jokes. “What do you think?” she asked 
Cody. 

“I think I have to go home,” Cody said. He tossed a handful of grass at 
her. 

Kris brushed the green blades off Mr. Wood’s wooden head. She 
mbbed her hand gently over the dummy’s painted red hair. “You’re hurting 
Mr. Wood’s feelings,” she told Cody. 

Cody climbed to his feet. “Why do you want to mess with that thing, 
anyway?” he asked, pushing his white-blond hair back off his forehead. 

“Because it’s fun,” Kris replied. 

“Is that the real reason?” Cody demanded. 

“Well... I guess I want to show Lindy that I’m better at it than she is.” 

“You two are weird!” Cody declared. “See you in school.” He gave 
her a little wave, then turned and headed for his home down the block. 

Kris pulled down the blankets and climbed into bed. Pale moonlight filtered 
in through the bedroom window. 

Yawning, she glanced at the clock-radio. Nearly ten. She could hear 
Lindy brushing her teeth in the bathroom across the hall. 

Why does Lindy always hum when she brushes her teeth? Kris 



wondered. How can one twin sister do so many annoying things? 

She gave Mr. Wood one last glance. He was propped in the chair in 
front of the window, his hands carefully placed in his lap, his white 
sneakers hanging over the chair edge. 

He looks like a real person, Kris thought sleepily. 

Tomorrow I’m going to check out some good joke books from the 
library at school. I can be funnier than Lindy. I know I can. 

She settled back sleepily on her pillow. I’ll be asleep as soon as we 
turn off the lights, she thought. 

A few seconds later, Lindy entered the room, wearing her nightshirt 
and carrying Slappy under one arm. “You asleep?” she asked Kris. 

“Almost,” Kris replied, yawning loudly. “I’ve been studying for the 
math final all night. Where’ve you been?” 

“Over at Alice’s,” Lindy told her, setting Slappy down in the chair 
beside Mr. Wood. “Some kids were over, and I practiced my act for them. 
They laughed so hard, I thought they’d split a gut. When Slappy and I did 
our rap routine, Alice spit her chocolate milk out her nose. What a riot!” 

“That’s nice,” Kris said without enthusiasm. “Guess you and Slappy 
are ready for Amy’s birthday party on Saturday.” 

“Yeah,” Lindy replied. She placed Slappy’s arm around Mr. Wood’s 
shoulder. “They look so cute together,” she said. Then she noticed the 
clothing neatly draped over the desk chair. “What’s that?” she asked Kris. 

Kris raised her head from the pillow to see what her sister was 
pointing at. “My outfit for tomorrow,” she told her. “We’re having a dress- 
up party in Miss Finch’s class. It’s a farewell party. For Margot. You know. 
The student teacher.” 

Lindy stared at the clothes. “Your Betsey Johnson skirt? Your silk 
blouse?” 

“We’re supposed to get really dressed up,” Kris said, yawning. “Can 
we go to sleep now?” 

“Yeah. Sure.” Lindy made her way to her bed, sat down, and clicked 
off the bed-table lamp. “Are you getting any better with Mr. Wood?” she 
asked, climbing between the sheets. 

Kris was stung by the question. It was such an obvious put-down. 
“Yeah. I’m getting really good. I did some stuff for Cody. Out in the back 
yard. Cody laughed so hard, he couldn’t breathe. Really. He was holding his 



sides. He said Mr. Wood and I should be on TV.” 

“Really?” Lindy replied after a long moment’s hesitation. “That’s 
weird. I never thought Cody had much of a sense of humor. He’s always so 
grim. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him laugh.” 

“Well, he was laughing at Mr. Wood and me,” Kris insisted, wishing 
she were a better liar. 

“Awesome,” Lindy muttered. “I can’t wait to see your act.” 

Neither can I, Kris thought glumly. 

A few seconds later, they were both asleep. 

Their mother’s voice, calling from downstairs, awoke them at seven the 
next morning. Bright, morning-orange sunlight poured in through the 
window. Kris could hear birds chirping happily in the old maple tree. 

“Rise and shine! Rise and shine!” Every morning, Mrs. Powell shouted 
up the same words. 

Kris mbbed the sleep from her eyes, then stretched her arms high over 
her head. She glanced across the room, then uttered a quiet gasp. “Hey— 
what’s going on?” She reached across to Lindy’s bed and shook Lindy by 
the shoulder. “What’s going on?” 

“Huh?” Lindy, startled, sat straight up. 

“What’s the joke? Where is he?” Kris demanded. 

“Huh?” 

Kris pointed to the chair across the room. 

Sitting straight up in the chair, Slappy grinned back at them, bathed in 
morning sunlight. 

But Mr. Wood was gone.

Kris blinked several times and pushed herself up in bed with both hands. 
Her left hand tingled. She must have been sleeping on it, she realized. 

“What? What’s wrong?” Lindy asked, her voice fogged with sleep. 

“Where’s Mr. Wood?” Kris demanded impatiently. “Where’d you put 
him?” 

“Huh? Put him?” Lindy struggled to focus her eyes. She saw Slappy 
sitting stiffly on the chair across the room. By himself. 

“It’s not funny,” Kris snapped. She climbed out of bed, pulled down 
the hem of her nightshirt, and made her way quickly to the chair in front of 
the window. “Don’t you ever get tired of playing stupid jokes?” 

“Jokes? Huh?” Lindy lowered her feet to the floor. 

Kris bent down to search the floor under the chair. Then she moved to 
the foot of the bed and got down on her knees to search under both twin 
beds. 

“Where is he, Lindy?” she asked angrily, on her knees at the foot of 
the bed. “I don’t think this is funny. I really don’t.” 

“Well, neither do I,” Lindy insisted, standing up and stretching. 

Kris climbed to her feet. Her eyes went wide as she spotted the 
missing dummy. 

“Oh!” 

Lindy followed her sister’s startled gaze. 

Mr. Wood grinned at them from the doorway. He appeared to be 
standing, his skinny legs bent at an awkward angle. 

He was wearing Kris’ dress-up clothes, the Betsey Johnson skirt and 
the silk blouse. 

Her mouth wide open in surprise, Kris made her way quickly to the 
doorway. She immediately saw that the dummy wasn’t really standing on 
his own. He had been propped up, the doorknob shoved into the opening in 
his back. 

She grabbed the dummy by the waist and pulled him away from the 
door. “My blouse. It’s all wrinkled,” she cried, holding it so Lindy could 
see. She narrowed her eyes angrily at her sister. “This was so obnoxious of 



you, Lindy.” 

“Me?” Lindy shrieked. “I swear, Kris, I didn’t do it. I slept like a rock 
last night. I didn’t move. I didn’t get up till you woke me. I didn’t do it. 
Really!” 

Kris stared hard at her sister, then lowered her eyes to the dummy. 

In her blouse and skirt, Mr. Wood grinned up at her, as if enjoying her 
bewilderment. 

“Well, Mr. Wood,” Kris said aloud, “I guess you put on my clothes and 
walked to the door all by yourself!” 

Lindy started to say something. But their mother’s voice from 
downstairs interrupted. “Are you girls going to school today? Where are 
you? You’re late!” 

“Coming!” Kris called down, casting an angry glance at Lindy. She 
carefully set Mr. Wood down on his back on her bed and pulled her skirt 
and blouse off him. She looked up to see Lindy making a mad dash across 
the hall to be first in the bathroom. 

Sighing, Kris stared down at Mr. Wood. The dummy grinned up at her, 
a mischievous grin. 

“Well? What’s going on?” she asked the dummy. “I didn’t dress you 
up and move you. And Lindy swears she didn’t do it.” 

But if we didn’t do it, she thought, who did?

“Tilt his head forward,” Lindy instructed. “That’s it. If you bounce him up 
and down a little, it’ll make it look like he’s laughing.” 

Kris obediently bounced Mr. Wood on her lap, making him laugh. 

“Don’t move his mouth so much,” Lindy told her. 

“I think you’re both crazy,” Lindy’s friend Alice said. 

“So what else is new?” Cody joked. 

All four of them were sitting in a small patch of shade under the bent 
old maple tree in the Powells’ back yard. It was a hot Saturday afternoon, 
the sun high in a pale blue sky, streaks of yellow light filtering down 
through the shifting leaves above their heads. 

Barky sniffed busily around the yard, his little tail wagging nonstop. 

Kris sat on a folding chair, which leaned back against the gnarled tree 
trunk. She had Mr. Wood on her lap. 

Lindy and Alice stood at the edge of the shade, their hands crossed 
over their chests, watching Kris’ performance with frowns of concentration 
on their faces. 

Alice was a tall, skinny girl, with straight black hair down to her 
shoulders, a snub nose, and a pretty, heart-shaped mouth. She was wearing 
white shorts and a bright blue midriff top. 

Cody was sprawled on his back in the grass, his hands behind his head, 
a long blade of grass between his teeth. 

Kris was trying to show off her ventriloquist skills. But Lindy kept 
interrupting with “helpful” suggestions. When she wasn’t making 
suggestions, Lindy was nervously glancing at her watch. She didn’t want to 
be late for her job at Amy’s birthday party at two o’clock. 

“I think you’re way weird,” Alice told Lindy. 

“Hey, no way,” Lindy replied. “Slappy is a lot of fun. And I’m going 
to make a lot of money with him. And maybe I’ll be a comedy star or 
something when I’m older.” She glanced at her watch again. 

“Well, everyone at school thinks that both of you are weird,” Alice 
said, swatting a fly off her bare arm. 

“Who cares?” Lindy replied sharply. “They’re all weird, too.” 



“And so are you,” Kris made Mr. Wood say. 

“I could see your lips move,” Lindy told Kris. 

Kris rolled her eyes. “Give me a break. You’ve been giving me a hard 
time all morning.” 

“Just trying to help,” Lindy said. “You don’t have to be so defensive, 
do you?” 

Kris uttered an angry growl. 

“Was that your stomach?” she made Mr. Wood say. 

Cody laughed. 

“At least one person thinks you’re funny,” Lindy said dryly. “But if 
you want to do parties, you really should get some better jokes.” 

Kris let the dummy slump to her lap. “I can’t find any good joke 
books,” she said dejectedly. “Where do you find your jokes?” 

A superior sneer formed on Lindy’s face. She tossed her long hair 
behind her shoulder. “I make up my own jokes,” she replied snootily. 

“You are a joke!” Cody said. 

“Ha-ha. Remind me to laugh later,” Lindy said sarcastically. 

“I can’t believe you don’t have your dummy out here,” Alice told 
Lindy. “I mean, don’t you want to rehearse for the party?” 

“No need,” Lindy replied. “I’ve got my act down. I don’t want to over¬ 
rehearse.” 

Kris groaned loudly. 

“Some of the other parents are staying at the birthday party to watch 
Slappy and me,” Lindy continued, ignoring Kris’ sarcasm. “If the kids like 
me, their parents might hire me for their parties.” 

“Maybe you and Kris should do an act together,” Alice suggested. 
“That could be really awesome.” 

“Yeah. What an act! Then there’d be four dummies!” Cody joked. 

Alice was the only one to laugh. 

Lindy made a face at Cody. “That might actually be fun,” she said 
thoughtfully. And then she added, “When Kris is ready.” 

Kris drew in her breath and prepared to make an angry reply. 

But before she could say anything, Lindy grabbed Mr. Wood from her 
hands. “Let me give you a few pointers,” Lindy said, putting one foot on 
Kris’ folding chair and arranging Mr. Wood on her lap. “You have to hold 
him up straighter, like this.” 



“Hey—give him back,” Kris demanded, reaching for her dummy. 

As she reached up, Mr. Wood suddenly lowered his head until he was 
staring down at her. “You’re a jerk!” he rasped in Kris’ face, speaking in a 
low, throaty growl. 

“Huh?” Kris pulled back in surprise. 

“You’re a stupid jerk!” Mr. Wood repeated nastily in the same harsh 
growl. 

“Lindy—stop it!” Kris cried. 

Cody and Alice both stared in openmouthed surprise. 

“Stupid moron! Get lost! Get lost, stupid jerk!” the dummy rasped in 
Kris’ face. 

“Whoa!” Cody exclaimed. 

“Make him stop!” Kris screamed at her sister. 

“I can’t!” Lindy cried in a trembling voice. Her face became pale, her 
eyes wide with fear. “I can’t make him stop, Kris! He—he’s speaking for 
himself!”

The dummy glared at Kris, its grin ugly and evil. 

“I—I can’t make him stop. I’m not doing it,” Lindy cried. Tugging 
with all her might, she pulled Mr. Wood out of Kris’ face. 

Cody and Alice flashed each other bewildered glances. 

Frightened, Kris raised herself from the folding chair and backed up 
against the tree trunk. “He—he’s talking on his own?” She stared hard at 
the grinning dummy. 

“I—I think so. I’m... all mixed up!” Lindy declared, her cheeks bright 

pink. 

Barky yipped and jumped on Lindy’s legs, trying to get her attention. 
But she kept her gaze on Kris’ frightened face. 

“This is a joke—right?” Cody asked hopefully. 

“What’s going on?” Alice demanded, her arms crossed in front of her 
chest. 

Ignoring them, Lindy handed Mr. Wood back to Kris. “Here. Take 
him. He’s yours. Maybe you can control him.” 

“But, Lindy—” Kris started to protest. 

Lindy glared at her watch. “Oh, no! The party! I’m late!” Shaking her 
head, she took off toward the house. “Later!” she called without looking 
back. 

“But Lindy—” Kris called. 

The kitchen door slammed behind Lindy. 

Holding Mr. Wood by the shoulders, Kris lowered her eyes to his face. 
He grinned up at her, a devilish grin, his eyes staring intently into hers. 

Kris swung easily, leaning back and raising her feet into the air. The chains 
squeaked with every swing. The old back yard swingset, half covered with 
mst, hadn’t been used much in recent years. 

The early evening sun was lowering itself behind the house. The 
aroma of a roasting chicken floated out from the kitchen window. Kris 
could hear her mother busy in the kitchen preparing dinner. 

Barky yapped beneath her. Kris dropped her feet to the ground and 



stopped the swing to avoid kicking him. “Dumb dog. Don’t you know you 
could get hurt?” 

She looked up to see Lindy come running up the driveway, holding 
Slappy under her arm. From the smile on Lindy’s face, Kris knew at once 
that the birthday party had been a triumph. But she had to ask anyway. 
“How’d it go?” 

“It was awesome!” Lindy exclaimed. “Slappy and I were great'.” 

Kris pulled herself off the swing and forced a smile to her face. “That’s 
nice,” she offered. 

“The kids thought we were a riot!” Lindy continued. She pulled 
Slappy up. “Didn’t they, Slappy?” 

“They liked me. Hated you!” Slappy declared in Lindy’s high-pitched 
voice. 

Kris forced a laugh. “I’m glad it went okay,” she said, trying hard to be 
a good sport. 

“I did a sing-along with Slappy, and it went over really well. Then 
Slappy and I did our rap routine. What a hit!” Lindy gushed. 

She’s spreading it on a little thick, Kris thought bitterly. Kris couldn’t 
help feeling jealous. 

“The kids all lined up to talk to Slappy,” Lindy continued. “Didn’t 
they, Slappy?” 

“Everyone loved me,” she made the dummy say. “Where’s my share of 
the loot?” 

“So you got paid twenty dollars?” Kris asked, kicking at a clump of 
weeds. 

“Twenty-five,” Lindy replied. “Amy’s mom said I was so good, she’d 
pay me extra. Oh. And guess what else? You know Mrs. Evans? The 
woman who always wears the leopardskin pants? You know—Anna’s 
mom? She asked me to do Anna’s party next Sunday. She’s going to pay me 
thirty dollars! I’m going to be rich!” 

“Wow. Thirty dollars,” Kris muttered, shaking her head. 

“I get twenty. You get ten,” Lindy made Slappy say. 

“I have to go tell Mom the good news!” Lindy said. “What have you 
been doing all afternoon?” 

“Well, after you left, I was pretty upset,” Kris replied, following Lindy 
to the house. “You know. About Mr. Wood. I—I put him upstairs. Alice and 



Cody went home. Then Mom and I went to the mall.” 

His tail wagging furiously, Barky ran right over their feet, nearly 
tripping both of them. “Barky, look out!” Lindy yelled. 

“Oh. I nearly forgot,” Kris said, stopping on the back stoop. 
“Something good happened.” 

Lindy stopped, too. “Something good?” 

“Yeah. I ran into Mrs. Berman at the mall.” Mrs. Berman was their 
music teacher and organizer of the spring concert. 

“Thrills,” Lindy replied sarcastically. 

“And Mrs. Berman asked if Mr. Wood and I wanted to be master of 
ceremonies for the spring concert.” Kris smiled at her sister. 

Lindy swallowed hard. “She asked you to host the concert?” 

“Yeah. I get to perform with Mr. Wood in front of everyone!” Kris 
gushed happily. She saw a flash of jealousy on Lindy’s face, which made 
her even happier. 

Lindy pulled open the screen door. “Well, good luck,” she said dryly. 
“With that weird dummy of yours, you’ll need it.” 

Dinner was spent talking about Lindy’s performance at Amy Marshall’s 
birthday party. Lindy and Mrs. Powell chatted excitedly. Kris ate in silence. 

“At first I thought the whole thing was strange, I have to admit,” Mrs. 
Powell said, scooping ice cream into bowls for dessert. “I just couldn’t 
believe you’d be interested in ventriloquism, Lindy. But I guess you have a 
flair for it. I guess you have some talent.” 

Lindy beamed. Mrs. Powell normally wasn’t big on compliments. 

“I found a book in the school library about ventriloquism,” Lindy said. 
“It had some pretty good tips in it. It even had a comedy routine to 
perform.” She glanced at Kris. “But I like making up my own jokes better.” 

“You should watch your sister’s act,” Mrs. Powell told Kris, handing 
her a bowl of ice cream. “I mean, you could probably pick up some pointers 
for the concert at school.” 

“Maybe,” Kris replied, trying to hide how annoyed she was. 

After dinner, Mr. Powell called from Portland, and they all talked with 
him. Lindy told him about her success with Slappy at the birthday party. 
Kris told him about being asked to host the concert with Mr. Wood. Her 
father promised he wouldn’t schedule any road trips so that he could attend 



the concert. 

After watching a video their mother had rented at the mall, the two 
sisters went up to their room. It was a little after eleven. 

Kris clicked on the light. Lindy followed her in. 

They both glanced across the room to the chair where they kept the 
two dummies—and gasped. 

“Oh, no!” Lindy cried, raising one hand to her wide open mouth. 

Earlier that night, the dummies had been placed side by side in a 
sitting position. 

But now Slappy was upside down, falling out of the chair, his head on 
the floor. His brown shoes had been pulled off his feet and tossed against 
the wall. His suit jacket had been pulled halfway down his arms, trapping 
his hands behind his back. 

“L-look!” Kris stammered, although her sister was already staring in 
horror at the scene. “Mr. Wood—he’s...” Kris’ voice caught in her throat. 

Mr. Wood was sprawled on top of Slappy. His hands were wrapped 
around Slappy’s throat, as if he were strangling him. 



10 


“I—I don’t believe this!” Kris managed to whisper. She turned and caught 
the frightened expression on Lindy’s face. 

“What’s going on?” Lindy cried. 

Both sisters hurried across the room. Kris grabbed Mr. Wood by the 
back of the neck and pulled him off the other dummy. She felt as if she 
were separating two fighting boys. 

She held Mr. Wood up in front of her, examining him carefully, staring 
at his face as if half-expecting him to talk to her. 

Then she lowered the dummy and tossed it facedown onto her bed. 
Her face was pale and taut with fear. 

Lindy stooped and picked up Slappy’s brown shoes from the floor. She 
held them up and studied them, as if they would offer a clue as to what had 
happened. 

“Kris—did you do this?” Lindy asked softly. 

“Huh? Me?” Kris reacted with surprise. 

“I mean, I know you’re jealous of Slappy and me—” Lindy started. 

“Whoa. Wait a minute,” Kris replied angrily in a shrill, trembling 
voice. “I didn’t do this, Lindy. Don’t accuse me.” 

Lindy glared at her sister, studying her face. Then her expression 
softened and she sighed. “I don’t get. I just don’t get it. Look at Slappy. 
He’s nearly been torn apart.” 

She set the shoes down on the chair and picked the dummy up gently 
as if picking up a baby. Holding him in one hand, she struggled to pull his 
suit jacket up with the other. 

Kris heard her sister mutter something. It sounded like “Your dummy 
is evil.” 

“What did you say?” Kris demanded. 

“Nothing,” Lindy replied, still struggling with the jacket. “I’m... uh... 
I’m kind of scared about this,” Lindy confessed, blushing, avoiding Kris’ 
eyes. 

“Me, too,” Kris admitted. “Something weird is going on. I think we 
should tell Mom.” 



Lindy buttoned the jacket. Then she sat down on the bed with Slappy 
on her lap and started to replace the dummy’s shoes. “Yeah. I guess we 
should,” she replied. “It—it’s just so creepy.” 

Their mother was in bed, reading a Stephen King novel. Her bedroom 
was dark except for a tiny reading lamp on her headboard that threw down a 
narrow triangle of yellow light. 

Mrs. Powell uttered a short cry as her two daughters appeared out of 
the shadows. “Oh. You startled me. This is such a scary book, and I think I 
was just about to fall asleep.” 

“Can we talk to you?” Kris asked eagerly in a low whisper. 

“Something weird is going on,” Lindy added. 

Mrs. Powell yawned and closed her book. “What’s wrong?” 

“It’s about Mr. Wood,” Kris said. “He’s been doing a lot of strange 
things.” 

“Huh?” Mrs. Powell’s eyes opened wide. She looked pale and tired 
under the harsh light from the reading lamp. 

“He was strangling Slappy,” Lindy reported. “And this afternoon, he 
said some really gross things. And—” 

“Stop!” Mrs. Powell ordered, raising one hand. “Just stop.” 

“But, Mom—” Kris started. 

“Give me a break, girls,” their mother said wearily. “I’m tired of your 
silly competitions.” 

“You don’t understand,” Lindy interrupted. 

“Yes, I do understand,” Mrs. Powell said sharply. “You two are even 
competing with those ventriloquist dummies.” 

“Mom, please!” 

“I want it to stop right now,” Mrs. Powell insisted, tossing the book 
onto her bed table. “I mean it. I don’t want to hear another word from either 
of you about those dummies. If you two have problems, settle it between 
yourselves.” 

“Mom, listen—” 

“And if you can’t settle it, I’ll take the dummies away. Both of them. 
I’m serious.” Mrs. Powell reached above her head and clicked off the 
reading light, throwing the room into darkness. “Good night,” she said. 

The girls had no choice but to leave the room. They slunk down the 
hall in silence. 



Kris hesitated at the doorway to their bedroom. She expected to find 
Mr. Wood strangling Slappy again. She breathed a sigh of relief when she 
saw the two dummies on the bed where they had been left. 

“Mom wasn’t too helpful,” Lindy said dryly, rolling her eyes. She 
picked up Slappy and started to arrange him in the chair in front of the 
window. 

“I think she was asleep and we woke her up,” Kris replied. 

She picked up Mr. Wood and started toward the chair with him—then 
stopped. “You know what? I think I’m going to put him in the closet 
tonight,” she said thoughtfully. 

“Good idea,” Lindy said, climbing into bed. 

Kris glanced down at the dummy, half-expecting him to react. To 
complain. To start calling her names. 

But Mr. Wood grinned up at her, his painted eyes dull and lifeless. 

Kris felt a chill of fear. 

I’m becoming afraid of a stupid ventriloquist’s dummy, she thought. 

I’m shutting him up in the closet tonight because I’m afraid. 

She carried Mr. Wood to the closet. Then, with a groan, she raised him 
high above her head and slid him onto the top shelf. Carefully closing the 
closet door, listening for the click, she made her way to her bed. 

She slept fitfully, tossing on top of the covers, her sleep filled with 
disturbing dreams. She awoke to find her nightshirt completely twisted, 
cutting off the circulation to her right arm. She struggled to straighten it, 
then fell back to sleep. 

She awoke early, drenched in sweat. The sky was still dawn-gray outside 
the window. 

The room felt hot and stuffy. She sat up slowly, feeling weary, as if she 
hadn’t slept at all. 

Blinking away the sleep, her eyes focused on the chair in front of the 
window. 

There sat Slappy, exactly where Lindy had placed him. 

And beside him sat Mr. Wood, his arm around Slappy’s shoulder, 
grinning triumphantly at Kris as if he had just pulled off a wonderful joke. 



11 


“Now, Mr. Wood, do you go to school?” 

“Of course I do. Do you think I’m a dummy?” 

“And what’s your favorite class?” 

“Wood shop, of course!” 

“What project are you building in shop class, Mr. Wood?” 

“I’m building a girl dummy! What else? Ha-ha! Think I want to spend 
the rest of my life on your lap?!” 

Kris sat in front of the dressing table mirror with Mr. Wood on her lap, 
studying herself as she practiced her routine for the school concert. 

Mr. Wood had been well-behaved for two days. No frightening, 
mysterious incidents. Kris was beginning to feel better. Maybe everything 
would go okay from now on. 

She leaned close to the mirror, watching her lips as she made the 
dummy talk. 

The b’s and the m’s were impossible to pronounce without moving her 
lips. She’d just have to avoid those sounds as best she could. 

I’m getting better at switching from Mr. Wood’s voice back to mine, 
she thought happily. But I’ve got to switch faster. The faster he and I talk, 
the funnier it is. 

“Let’s try it again, Mr. Wood,” she said, pulling her chair closer to the 
mirror. 

“Work, work, work,” she made the dummy grumble. 

Before she could begin the routine, Lindy came rushing breathlessly 
into the room. Kris watched her sister in the mirror as she came up behind 
her, her long hair flying loosely over her shoulders, an excited smile on her 
face. 

“Guess what?” Lindy asked. 

Kris started to reply, but Lindy didn’t give her a chance. 

“Mrs. Petrie was at Amy Marshall’s birthday party,” Lindy gushed 
excitedly. “She works for Channel Three. You know. The TV station. And 
she thinks I’m good enough to go on Talent Search, the show they have 
every week.” 



“Huh? Really?” was all Kris could manage in reply. 

Lindy leapt excitedly in the air and cheered. “Slappy and I are going to 
be on TV!” she cried. “Isn’t that fabulous ?” 

Staring at her sister’s jubilant reflection in the mirror, Kris felt a stab 
of jealousy. 

“I’ve got to tell Mom!” Lindy declared. “Hey, Mom! Mom!” She ran 
from the room. Kris heard her shouting all the way down the stairs. 

“Aaaaaargh!” Kris couldn’t hold it in. She uttered an angry cry. 

“Why does everything good happen to Lindy?” Kris screamed aloud. 
“I’m hosting a stupid concert for maybe a hundred parents—and she’s 
going to be on TV! I’m just as good as she is. Maybe better!” 

In a rage, she raised Mr. Wood high over her head and slammed him to 
the floor. 

The dummy’s head made a loud clonk as it hit the hardwood floor. The 
wide mouth flew open as if about to scream. 

“Oh.” Kris struggled to regain her composure. 

Mr. Wood, crumpled at her feet, stared up at her accusingly. 

Kris lifted him up and cradled the dummy against her. “There, there, 
Mr. Wood,” she whispered soothingly. “Did I hurt you? Did I? I’m so sorry. 
I didn’t mean to.” 

The dummy continued to stare up at her. His painted grin hadn’t 
changed, but his eyes seemed cold and unforgiving. 

It was a still night. No breeze. The curtains in front of the open bedroom 
window didn’t flutter or move. Pale silver moonlight filtered in, creating 
long, purple shadows that appeared to creep across the girls’ bedroom. 

Lindy had been sleeping fitfully, a light sleep filled with busy, colorful 
dreams. She was startled awake by a sound. A gentle thud. 

“Huh?” she raised her head from the damp pillow and turned. 

Someone was moving in the darkness. 

The sounds she’d heard were footsteps. 

“Hey!” she whispered, wide awake now. “Who is it?” 

The figure turned in the doorway, a shadow against even blacker 
shadows. “It’s only me,” came a whispered reply. 

“Kris?” 

“Yeah. Something woke me up. My throat is sore,” Kris whispered 



from the doorway. “I’m going down to the kitchen for a glass of water.” 

She disappeared into the shadows. Her head still raised off the pillow, 
Lindy listened to her footsteps padding down the stairs. 

When the sounds faded, Lindy shut her eyes and lowered her head to 
the pillow. 

A few seconds later, she heard Kris’ scream of horror. 



12 


Her heart pounding, Lindy struggled out of bed. The sheet tangled around 
her legs, and she nearly fell. 

Kris’ bloodcurdling scream echoed in her ears. 

She practically leapt down the dark stairway, her bare feet thudding 
hard on the thin carpet of the steps. 

It was dark downstairs, except for a thin sliver of yellow light from the 
kitchen. 

“Kris—Kris—are you okay?” Lindy called, her voice sounding small 
and frightened in the dark hallway. 

“Kris?” 

Lindy stopped at the kitchen doorway. 

What was that eerie light? 

It took her a while to focus. Then she realized she was staring at the 
dim yellow light from inside the refrigerator. 

The refrigerator door was wide open. 

And... the refrigerator was empty. 

“What—what’s going on here?” 

She took a step into the kitchen. Then another. 

Something cold and wet surrounded her foot. 

Lindy gasped and, looking down, saw that she had stepped into a wide 
puddle. 

An overturned milk carton beside her foot revealed that the puddle was 
spilled milk. 

She raised her eyes to Kris, who was standing in darkness across the 
room, her back against the wall, her hands raised to her face in horror. 

“Kris, what on earth—” 

The scene was coming into focus now. It was all so weird, so... wrong. 
It was taking Lindy a long time to see the whole picture. 

But, now, following Kris’ horrified stare, Lindy saw the mess on the 
floor. And realized why the refrigerator was empty. 

Everything inside it had been pulled out and dumped on the kitchen 



floor. An orange juice bottle lay on its side in a puddle of orange juice. 
Eggs were scattered everywhere. Fruits and vegetables were strewn over 
the floor. 

“Ohh!” Lindy moaned in utter disbelief. 

Everything seemed to sparkle and gleam. 

What was all that shiny stuff among the food? 

Kris’jewelry! 

There were earrings and bracelets and strands of beads tossed 
everywhere, mixed with the spilled, strewn food like some kind of bizarre 
salad. 

“Oh, no!” Lindy shrieked as her eyes came to rest on the figure on the 
floor. 

Sitting upright in the middle of the mess was Mr. Wood, grinning 
gleefully at her. He had several strands of beads around his neck, long, 
dangling earrings hanging from his ears, and a platter of leftover chicken on 
his lap. 



13 


“Kris, are you okay?” Lindy cried, turning her eyes away from the grinning, 
jewelry-covered dummy. 

Kris didn’t seem to hear her. 

“Are you okay?” Lindy repeated the question. 

“Wh-what’s going on?” Kris stammered, her back pressed against the 
wall, her expression taut with terror. “Who—who did this? Did Mr. Wood 
_?” 

Lindy started to reply. But their mother’s howl of surprise from the 
doorway cut off her words. “Mom—” Lindy cried, spinning around. 

Mrs. Powell clicked on the ceiling light. The kitchen seemed to flare 
up. All three of them blinked, struggling to adjust to the sudden brightness. 

“What on earth!” Mrs. Powell cried. She started to call to her husband, 
then remembered he wasn’t home. “I—I don’t believe this!” 

Barky came bounding into the room, his tail wagging. He lowered his 
head and started to lick up some spilled milk. 

“Out you go,” Mrs. Powell said sternly. She picked up the dog, carried 
him out, and closed the kitchen door. Then she strode into the center of the 
room, shaking her head, her bare feet narrowly missing the puddle of milk. 

“I came down for a drink, and I—I found this mess,” Kris said in a 
trembling voice. “The food. My jewelry. Everything...” 

“Mr. Wood did it,” Lindy accused. “Look at him!” 

“Stop it! Stop it!” Mrs. Powell screamed. “I’ve had enough.” 

Mrs. Powell surveyed the mess, frowning and tugging at a strand of 
blonde hair. Her eyes stopped on Mr. Wood, and she uttered a groan of 
disgust. 

“I knew it,” she said in a low voice, raising her eyes accusingly to the 
two girls. “I knew this had something to do with those ventriloquist 
dummies.” 

“Mr. Wood did it, Mom,” Kris said heatedly, stepping away from the 
wall, her hands tensed into fists. “I know it sounds dumb, but—” 

“Stop it,” Mrs. Powell ordered, narrowing her eyes. “This is just sick. 
Sick!” She stared hard at the jewel-bedecked dummy, who grinned up at her 



over the big platter of chicken. 

“I’m going to take the dummies away from you both,” Mrs. Powell 
said, turning back to Lindy and Kris. “This whole thing has just gotten out 
of control.” 

“No!” Kris cried. 

“That’s not fair!” Lindy declared. 

“I’m sorry. They have to be put away,” Mrs. Powell said firmly. She let 
her eyes move over the cluttered floor, and let out another weary sigh. 
“Look at my kitchen.” 

“But I didn’t do anything!” Lindy screamed. 

“I need Mr. Wood for the spring concert!” Kris protested. “Everyone is 
counting on me, Mom.” 

Mrs. Powell glanced from one to the other. Her eyes stayed on Kris. 
“That’s your dummy on the floor, right?” 

“Yeah,” Kris told her. “But I didn’t do this. I swear!” 

“You both swear you didn’t do it, right?” Mrs. Powell said, suddenly 
looking very tired under the harsh ceiling light. 

“Yes,” Lindy answered quickly. 

“Then you both lose your dummies. I’m sorry,” Mrs. Powell said. 
“One of you is lying. I—I really can’t believe this.” 

A heavy silence blanketed the room as all three Powells stared down in 
dismay at the mess on the floor. 

Kris was the first to speak. “Mom, what if Lindy and I clean 
everything up?” 

Lindy caught on quickly. Her face brightened. “Yeah. What if we put 
everything back. Right now. Make the kitchen just like normal. Make it 
spotless. Can we keep our dummies?” 

Mrs. Powell shook her head. “No. I don’t think so. Look at this mess. 
All the vegetables are spoiled. And the milk.” 

“We’ll replace it all,” Kris said quickly. “With our allowance. And 
we’ll clean it up perfectly. Please. If we do that, give us one more chance?” 

Mrs. Powell twisted her face in concentration, debating with herself. 
She stared at her daughters’ eager faces. “Okay,” she replied finally. “I want 
the kitchen spotless when I come down in the morning. All the food, all the 
jewelry. Everything back where it goes.” 

“Okay,” both girls said in unison. 



“And I don’t want to see either of those dummies down here in my 
kitchen again,” Mrs. Powell demanded. “If you can do that, I’ll give you 
one more chance.” 

“Great!” both girls cried at once. 

“And I don’t want to hear any more arguments about those dummies,” 
Mrs. Powell continued. “No more fights. No more competing. No more 
blaming everything on the dummies. I don’t want to hear anything about 
them. Ever.” 

“You won’t,” Kris promised, glancing at her sister. 

“Thanks, Mom,” Lindy said. “You go to bed. We’ll clean up.” She 
gave her mother a gentle shove toward the doorway. 

“Not another word,” Mrs. Powell reminded them. 

“Right, Mom,” the twins agreed. 

Their mother disappeared toward her room. They began to clean up. 
Kris pulled a large garbage bag from the drawer and held it while Lindy 
tossed in empty cartons and spoiled food. 

Kris carefully collected her jewelry and carried it upstairs. 

Neither girl spoke. They worked in silence, picking up, cleaning, and 
mopping until the kitchen was clean. Lindy closed the refrigerator door. She 
yawned loudly. 

Kris inspected the floor on her hands and knees, making sure it was 
spotless. Then she picked up Mr. Wood. He grinned back at her as if it was 
all a big joke. 

This dummy has been nothing but trouble, Kris thought. 

Nothing but trouble. 

She followed Lindy out of the kitchen, clicking off the light as she left. 
The two girls climbed the stairs silently. Neither of them had spoken a 
word. 

Pale moonlight filtered into their room through the open window. The 
air felt hot and steamy. 

Kris glanced at the clock. It was a little past three in the morning. 

Slappy sat slumped in the chair in front of the window, moonlight 
shining on his grinning face. Lindy, yawning, climbed into bed, pushed 
down the blanket, and pulled up the sheet. She turned her face away from 
her sister. 

Kris lowered Mr. Wood from her shoulder. You’re nothing but trouble, 



she thought angrily, holding him in front of her and staring at his grinning 
face. 

Nothing but trouble. 

Mr. Wood’s wide, leering grin seemed to mock her. 

A chill of fear mixed with her anger. 

I’m beginning to hate this dummy, she thought. 

Fear him and hate him. 

Angrily, she pulled open the closet door and tossed the dummy into the 
closet. It fell in a crumpled heap on the closet floor. 

Kris slammed the closet door shut. 

Her heart thudding, she climbed into bed and pulled up the covers. She 
suddenly felt very tired. Her entire body ached from weariness. 

She buried her face in the pillow and shut her eyes. 

She had just about fallen asleep when she heard the tiny voice. 

“Let me out! Let me out of here!” it cried. A muffled voice, coming 
from inside the closet. 



14 


“Let me out! Let me out!” the high-pitched voice called angrily. 

Kris sat up with a jolt. Her entire body convulsed in a shudder of fear. 

Her eyes darted to the other bed. Lindy hadn’t moved. 

“Did—did you hear it?” Kris stammered. 

“Hear what?” Lindy asked sleepily. 

“The voice,” Kris whispered. “In the closet.” 

“Huh?” Lindy asked sleepily. “What are you talking about? It’s three 
in the morning. Can’t we get some sleep?” 

“But, Lindy—” Kris lowered her feet to the floor. Her heart was 
thudding in her chest. “Wake up. Listen to me! Mr. Wood was calling to me. 
He was talking !” 

Lindy raised her head and listened. 

Silence. 

“I don’t hear anything, Kris. Really. Maybe you were dreaming.” 

“No!” Kris shrieked, feeling herself lose control. “It wasn’t a dream! 
I’m so scared, Lindy. I’m just so scared !” 

Suddenly Kris was trembling all over, and hot tears were pouring 
down her cheeks. 

Lindy stood up and moved to the edge of her sister’s bed. 

“Something h-horrible is going on here, Lindy,” Kris stammered 
through her tears. 

“And I know who’s doing it,” Lindy whispered, leaning over her twin, 
putting a comforting hand on her quivering shoulder. 

“Huh?” 

“Yes. I know who’s been doing it all,” Lindy whispered. “I know who 
it is.” 


“Who?” Kris asked breathlessly. 



15 


“Who?” Kris repeated, letting the tears run down her cheeks. “Who?” 

“I have,” Lindy said. Her smile spread into a grin almost as wide as 
Slappy’s. She closed her eyes and laughed. 

“Huh?” Kris didn’t understand. “What did you say?” 

“I said I have been doing it,” Lindy repeated. “Me. Lindy. It was all a 
joke, Kris. I gotcha again.” She nodded her head as if confirming her 
words. 

Kris gaped at her twin in disbelief. “It was all a joke?” 

Lindy kept nodding. 

“You moved Mr. Wood during the night? You dressed him in my 
clothes and made him say those gross things to me? You put him in the 
kitchen? You made that horrible mess?” 

Lindy chuckled. “Yeah. I really scared you, didn’t I?” 

Kris balled her hands into angry fists. “But—but—” she sputtered. 
“Why?” 

“For fun,” Lindy replied, dropping back onto her bed, still grinning. 

“Fun?” 

“I wanted to see if I could scare you,” Lindy explained. “It was just a 
joke. You know. I can’t believe you fell for that voice in the closet just now! 
I must be a really good ventriloquist!” 

“But, Lindy—” 

“You really believed Mr. Wood was alive or something!” Lindy said, 
laughing, enjoying her victory. “You’re such a nit!” 

“Nit?” 

“Half a nitwit!” Lindy burst into wild laughter. 

“It isn’t funny,” Kris said softly. 

“I know,” Lindy replied. “It’s a riot! You should’ve seen the look on 
your face when you saw Mr. Wood downstairs in your precious beads and 
earrings!” 

“How—how did you ever think of such a mean joke?” Kris demanded. 

“It just came to me,” Lindy answered with some pride. “When you got 
your dummy.” 



“You didn’t want me to get a dummy,” Kris said thoughtfully. 

“You’re right,” Lindy quickly agreed. “I wanted something that would 
be mine, for a change. I’m so tired of you being a copycat. So—” 

“So you thought of this mean joke,” Kris accused. 

Lindy nodded. 

Kris strode angrily to the window and pressed her forehead against the 
glass. “I—I can’t believe I was so stupid,” she muttered. 

“Neither can I,” Lindy agreed, grinning again. 

“You really made me start thinking that Mr. Wood was alive or 
something,” Kris said, staring out the window to the back yard below. “You 
really made me afraid of him.” 

“Aren’t I brilliant!” Lindy proclaimed. 

Kris turned to face her sister. “I’m never speaking to you again,” she 
said angrily. 

Lindy shrugged. “It was just a joke.” 

“No,” Kris insisted. “It was too mean to be just a joke. I’m never 
speaking to you again. Never.” 

“Fine,” Lindy replied curtly. “I thought you had a sense of humor. 
Fine.” She slid into bed, her back to Kris, and pulled the covers up over her 
head. 

I’ve got to find a way to pay her back for this, Kris thought. But how? 



16 


After school a few days later, Kris walked home with Cody. It was a hot, 
humid afternoon. The trees were still, and seemed to throw little shade on 
the sidewalk. The air above the pavement shimmered in the heat. 

“Wish we had a swimming pool,” Kris muttered, pulling her backpack 
off her shoulder. 

“I wish you had one, too,” Cody said, wiping his forehead with the 
sleeve of his red T-shirt. 

“I’d like to dive into an enormous pool of iced tea,” Kris said, “like in 
the TV commercials. It always looks so cold and refreshing.” 

Cody made a face. “Swim in iced tea? With ice cubes and lemon?” 

“Forget it,” Kris muttered. 

They crossed the street. A couple of kids they knew rode by on bikes. 
Two men in white uniforms were up on ladders, leaning against the corner 
house, painting the gutters. 

“Bet they’re hot,” Cody remarked. 

“Let’s change the subject,” Kris suggested. 

“How are you doing with Mr. Wood?” Cody asked. 

“Not bad,” Kris said. “I think I’ve got some pretty good jokes. I should 
be ready for the concert tomorrow night.” 

They stopped at the corner and let a large blue van rumble past. 

“Are you talking to your sister?” Cody asked as they crossed the street. 
The bright sunlight made his white-blond hair glow. 

“A little,” Kris said, making a face. “I’m talking to her. But I haven’t 
forgiven her.” 

“That was such a dumb stunt she pulled,” Cody said sympathetically. 
He wiped the sweat off his forehead with the sleeve of his T-shirt. 

“It just made me feel like such a dork,” Kris admitted. “I mean, I was 
so stupid. She really had me believing that Mr. Wood was doing all that 
stuff.” Kris shook her head. Thinking about it made her feel embarrassed all 
over again. 

Her house came into view. She unzipped the back compartment of her 
backpack and searched for the keys. 



“Did you tell your mom about Lindy’s practical joke?” Cody asked. 

Kris shook her head. “Mom is totally disgusted. We’re not allowed to 
mention the dummies to her. Dad got home from Portland last night, and 
Mom told him what was going on. So we’re not allowed to mention the 
dummies to him, either!” She found the keys and started up the drive. 
“Thanks for walking home with me.” 

“Yeah. Sure.” Cody gave her a little wave and continued on toward his 
house up the street. 

Kris pushed the key into the front door lock. She could hear Barky 
jumping and yipping excitedly on the other side of the door. “I’m coming, 
Barky,” she called in. “Hold your horses.” 

She pushed open the door. Barky began leaping on her, whimpering as 
if she’d been away for months. “Okay, okay!” she cried laughing. 

It took several minutes to calm the dog down. Then Kris got a snack 
from the kitchen and headed up to her room to practice with Mr. Wood. 

She hoisted the dummy up from the chair where it had spent the day 
beside Lindy’s dummy. A can of Coke in one hand, the dummy over her 
shoulder, she headed to the dressing table and sat down in front of the 
mirror. 

This was the best time of day to rehearse, Kris thought. No one was 
home. Her parents were at work. Lindy was at some after-school activity. 

She arranged Mr. Wood on her lap. “Time to go to work,” she made 
him say, reaching into his back to move his lips. She made his eyes slide 
back and forth. 

A button on his plaid shirt had come unbuttoned. Kris leaned him 
down against the dressing table and started to fasten it. 

Something caught her eye. Something yellow inside the pocket. 

“Weird,” Kris said aloud. “I never noticed anything in there.” 

Slipping two fingers into the slender pocket, she pulled out a yellowed 
sheet of paper, folded up. 

Probably just the receipt for him, Kris thought. 

She unfolded the sheet of paper and held it up to read it. 

It wasn’t a receipt. The paper contained a single sentence handwritten 
very cleanly in bold black ink. It was in a language Kris didn’t recognize. 
“Did someone send you a love note, Mr. Wood?” she asked the dummy. 

It stared up at her lifelessly. 



Kris lowered her eyes to the paper and read the strange sentence out 

loud: 

“Kami marri odonna loma molonu karrano.” 

What language is that? Kris wondered. 

She glanced down at the dummy and uttered a low cry of surprise. 

Mr. Wood appeared to blink. 

But that wasn’t possible —was it? 

Kris took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. 

The dummy stared up at her, his painted eyes as dull and wide open as 

ever. 

Let’s not get paranoid, Kris scolded herself. 

“Time to work, Mr. Wood,” she told him. She folded up the piece of 
yellow paper and slipped it back into his shirt pocket. Then she raised him 
to a sitting position, searching for the eye and mouth controls with her 
hand. 

“How are things around your house, Mr. Wood?” 

“Not good, Kris. I’ve got termites. I need termites like I need another 
hole in my head! Ha-ha!” 

“Lindy! Kris! Could you come downstairs, please!” Mr. Powell called from 
the foot of the stairs. 

It was after dinner, and the twins were up in their room. Lindy was 
sprawled on her stomach on the bed, reading a book for school. Kris was in 
front of the dressing table mirror, rehearsing quietly with Mr. Wood for 
tomorrow night’s concert. 

“What do you want, Dad?” Lindy shouted down, rolling her eyes. 
“We’re kind of busy,” Kris shouted, shifting the dummy on her lap. 
“The Millers are here, and they’re dying to see your ventriloquist 
acts,” their father shouted up. 

Lindy and Kris both groaned. The Millers were the elderly couple who 
lived next door. They were very nice people, but very boring. 

The twins heard Mr. Powell’s footsteps on the stairs. A few seconds 
later, he poked his head into their room. “Come on, girls. Just put on a short 
show for the Millers. They came over for coffee, and we told them about 
your dummies.” 

“But I have to rehearse for tomorrow night,” Kris insisted. 



“Rehearse on them,” her father suggested. “Come on. Just do five 
minutes. They’ll get a real kick out of it.” 

Sighing loudly, the girls agreed. Carrying their dummies over their 
shoulders, they followed their father down to the living room. 

Mr. and Mrs. Miller were side by side on the couch, coffee mugs in 
front of them on the low coffee table. They smiled and called out cheerful 
greetings as the girls appeared. 

Kris was always struck by how much the Millers looked alike. They 
both had slender, pink faces topped with spongy white hair. They both wore 
silver-framed bifocals, which slipped down on nearly identical, pointy 
noses. They both had the same smile. Mr. Miller had a small, gray 
mustache. Lindy always joked that he grew it so the Millers could tell each 
other apart. 

Is that what happens to you when you’ve been married a long time? 
Kris found herself thinking. You start to look exactly alike? 

The Millers were even dressed alike, in loose-fitting tan Bermuda 
shorts and white cotton sports shirts. 

“Lindy and Kris took up ventriloquism a few weeks ago,” Mrs. Powell 
was explaining, twisting herself forward to see the girls from the armchair. 
She motioned them to the center of the room. “And they both seem to have 
some talent for it.” 

“Have you girls ever heard of Bergen and McCarthy?” Mrs. Miller 
asked, smiling. 

“Who?” Lindy and Kris asked in unison. 

“Before your time,” Mr. Miller said, chuckling. “They were a 
ventriloquist act.” 

“Can you do something for us?” Mrs. Miller asked, picking up her 
coffee mug and setting it in her lap. 

Mr. Powell pulled a dining room chair into the center of the room. 
“Here. Lindy, why don’t you go first?” He turned to the Millers. “They’re 
very good. You’ll see,” he said. 

Lindy sat down and arranged Slappy on her lap. The Millers 
applauded. Mrs. Miller nearly spilled her coffee, but she caught the mug 
just in time. 

“Don’t applaud—just throw money!” Lindy made Slappy say. 
Everyone laughed as if they’d never heard that before. 



Kris watched from the stairway as Lindy did a short routine. Lindy 
was really good, she had to admit. Very smooth. The Millers were laughing 
so hard, their faces were bright red. An identical shade of red. Mrs. Miller 
kept squeezing her husband’s knee when she laughed. 

Lindy finished to big applause. The Millers gushed about how 
wonderful she was. Lindy told them about the TV show she might be on, 
and they promised they wouldn’t miss it. “We’ll tape it,” Mr. Miller said. 

Kris took her place on the chair and sat Mr. Wood up in her lap. “This 
is Mr. Wood,” she told the Millers. “We’re going to be the hosts of the 
spring concert at school tomorrow night. So I’ll give you a preview of what 
we’re going to say.” 

“That’s a nice-looking dummy,” Mrs. Miller said quietly. 

“You’re a nice-looking dummy, too!” Mr. Wood declared in a harsh, 
raspy growl of a voice. 

Kris’ mother gasped. The Millers’ smiles faded. 

Mr. Wood leaned forward on Kris’ lap and stared at Mr. Miller. “Is that 
a mustache, or are you eating a rat?” he asked nastily. 

Mr. Miller glanced uncomfortably at his wife, then forced a laugh. 
They both laughed. 

“Don’t laugh so hard. You might drop your false teeth!” Mr. Wood 
shouted. “And how do you get your teeth that disgusting shade of yellow? 
Does your bad breath do that?” 

“Kris!” Mrs. Powell shouted. “That’s enough!” 

The Millers’ faces were bright red now, their expressions bewildered. 

“That’s not funny. Apologize to the Millers,” Mr. Powell insisted, 
crossing the room and standing over Kris. 

“I—I didn’t say any of it!” Kris stammered. “Really, I—” 

“Kris—apologize!” her father demanded angrily. 

Mr. Wood turned to the Millers. “I’m sorry,” he rasped. “I’m sorry 
you’re so ugly! I’m sorry you’re so old and stupid, too!” 

The Millers stared at each other unhappily. “I don’t get her humor,” 
Mrs. Miller said. 

“It’s just crude insults,” Mr. Miller replied quietly. 

“Kris—what is wrong with you?” Mrs. Powell demanded. She had 
crossed the room to stand beside her husband. “Apologize to the Millers 
right now! I don’t believe you!” 



“I—I—” Gripping Mr. Wood tightly around the waist, Kris rose to her 
feet. “I—I—” She tried to utter an apology, but no words would come out. 

“Sorry!” she finally managed to scream. Then, with an embarrassed 
cry, she turned and fled up the stairs, tears streaming down her face. 



17 


“You have to believe me!” Kris cried in a trembling voice. “I really didn’t 
say any of those things. Mr. Wood was talking by himself!” 

Lindy rolled her eyes. “Tell me another one,” she muttered 
sarcastically. 

Lindy had followed Kris upstairs. Down in the living room, her 
parents were still apologizing to the Millers. Now, Kris sat on the edge of 
her bed, wiping tears off her cheeks. Lindy stood with her arms crossed in 
front of the dressing table. 

“I don’t make insulting jokes like that,” Kris said, glancing at Mr. 
Wood, who lay crumpled in the center of the floor where Kris had tossed 
him. “You know that isn’t my sense of humor.” 

“So why’d you do it?” Lindy demanded. “Why’d you want to make 
everyone mad?” 

“But I didn’t!” Kris shrieked, tugging at the sides of her hair. “Mr. 
Wood said those things! I didn’t!” 

“How can you be such a copycat?” Lindy asked disgustedly. “I already 
did that joke, Kris. Can’t you think of something original?” 

“It’s not a joke,” Kris insisted. “Why don’t you believe me?” 

“No way,” Lindy replied, shaking her head, her arms still crossed in 
front of her chest. “No way I’m going to fall for the same gag.” 

“Lindy, please!” Kris pleaded. “I’m frightened. I’m really frightened.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Lindy said sarcastically. “I’m shaking all over, too. 
Wow. You really fooled me, Kris. Guess you showed me you can play 
funny tricks, too.” 

“Shut up!” Kris snapped. More tears formed in the corners of her eyes. 

“Very good crying,” Lindy said. “But it doesn’t fool me, either. And it 
won’t fool Mom and Dad.” She turned and picked up Slappy. “Maybe 
Slappy and I should practice some jokes. After your performance tonight, 
Mom and Dad might not let you do the concert tomorrow night.” 

She slung Slappy over her shoulder and, stepping over the crumpled 
form of Mr. Wood, hurried from the room. 



It was hot and noisy backstage in the auditorium. Kris’ throat was dry, and 
she kept walking over to the water fountain and slurping mouthfuls of the 
warm water. 

The voices of the audience on the other side of the curtain seemed to 
echo off all four walls and the ceiling. The louder the noise became as the 
auditorium filled, the more nervous Kris felt. 

How am I ever going to do my act in front of all those people? she 
asked herself, pulling the edge of the curtain back a few inches and peering 
out. Her parents were off to the side, in the third row. 

Seeing them brought memories of the night before flooding back to 
Kris. Her parents had grounded her for two weeks as punishment for 
insulting the Millers. They almost hadn’t let her come to the concert. 

Kris stared at the kids and adults filing into the large auditorium, 
recognizing a lot of faces. She realized her hands were ice cold. Her throat 
was dry again. 

Don’t think of it as an audience, she told herself. Think of it as a bunch 
of kids and parents, most of whom you know. 

Somehow that made it worse. 

She let go of the curtain, hurried to get one last drink from the 
fountain, then retrieved Mr. Wood from the table she had left him on. 

It suddenly grew quiet on the other side of the curtain. The concert was 
about to begin. 

“Break a leg!” Lindy called across to her as she hurried to join the 
other chorus members. 

“Thanks,” Kris replied weakly. She pulled up Mr. Wood and 
straightened his shirt. “Your hands are clammy!” she made him say. 

“No insults tonight,” Kris told him sternly. 

To her shock, the dummy blinked. 

“Hey!” she cried. She hadn’t touched his eye controls. 

She had a stab of fear that went beyond stage fright. Maybe I shouldn’t 
go on with this, she thought, staring intently at Mr. Wood, watching for him 
to blink again. 

Maybe I should say I’m sick and not perform with him. 

“Are you nervous?” a voice whispered. 

“Huh?” At first, she thought it was Mr. Wood. But then she quickly 
realized that it was Mrs. Berman, the music teacher. 



“Yeah. A little,” Kris admitted, feeling her face grow hot. 

“You’ll be terrific,” Mrs. Berman gushed, squeezing Kris’ shoulder 
with a sweaty hand. She was a large, heavyset woman with several chins, a 
red lipsticked mouth, and flowing black hair. She was wearing a long, 
loose-fitting dress of red-and-blue flower patterns. “Here goes,” she said, 
giving Kris’ shoulder one more squeeze. 

Then she stepped onstage, blinking against the harsh white light of the 
spotlight, to introduce Kris and Mr. Wood. 

Am I really doing this? Kris asked herself. 

Can I do this? 

Her heart was pounding so hard, she couldn’t hear Mrs. Berman’s 
introduction. Then, suddenly, the audience was applauding, and Kris found 
herself walking across the stage to the microphone, carrying Mr. Wood in 
both hands. 

Mrs. Berman, her flowery dress flowing around her, was heading 
offstage. She smiled at Kris and gave her an encouraging wink as they 
passed each other. 

Squinting against the bright spotlight, Kris walked to the middle of the 
stage. Her mouth felt as dry as cotton. She wondered if she could make a 
sound. 

A folding chair had been set up for her. She sat down, arranging Mr. 
Wood on her lap, then realized that the microphone was much too high. 

This drew titters of soft laughter from the audience. 

Embarrassed, Kris stood up and, holding Mr. Wood under one arm, 
struggled to lower the microphone. 

“Are you having trouble?” Mrs. Berman called from the side of the 
stage. She hurried over to help Kris. 

But before the music teacher got halfway across the stage, Mr. Wood 
leaned into the microphone. “What time does the blimp go up?” he rasped 
nastily, staring at Mrs. Berman’s dress. 

“What?” She stopped in surprise. 

“Your face reminds me of a wart I had removed!” Mr. Wood growled 
at the startled woman. 

Her mouth dropped open in horror. “Kris!” 

“If we count your chins, will it tell us your age?” 

There was laughter floating up from the audience. But it was mixed 



with gasps of horror. 

“Kris—that’s enough!” Mrs. Berman cried, the microphone picking up 
her angry protest. 

“You’re more than enough! You’re enough for two!” Mr. Wood 
declared nastily. “If you got any bigger, you’d need your own zip code!” 

“Kris—really! I’m going to ask you to apologize,” Mrs. Berman said, 
her face bright red. 

“Mrs. Berman, I—I’m not doing it!” Kris stammered. “I’m not saying 
these things!” 

“Please apologize. To me and to the audience,” Mrs. Berman 
demanded. 

Mr. Wood leaned into the microphone. “Apologize for THIS!” he 
screamed. 

The dummy’s head tilted back. His jaw dropped. His mouth opened 
wide. 

And a thick green liquid came spewing out. 

“Yuck!” someone screamed. 

It looked like pea soup. It spurted up out of Mr. Wood’s open mouth 
like water rushing from a fire hose. 

Voices screamed and cried out their surprise as the thick, green liquid 
showered over the people in the front rows. 

“Stop it!” 

“Help!” 

“Somebody—turn it off!” 

“It stinks!” 

Kris froze in horror, staring as more and more of the disgusting 
substance poured from her dummy’s gaping mouth. 

A putrid stench—the smell of sour milk, of rotten eggs, of burning 
rubber, of decayed meat—rose up from the liquid. It puddled over the stage 
and showered over the front seats. 

Blinded by the spotlight, Kris couldn’t see the audience in front of her. 
But she could hear the choking and the gagging, the frantic cries for help. 

“Clear the auditorium! Clear the auditorium!” Mrs. Berman was 
shouting. 

Kris heard the rumble and scrape of people shoving their way up the 
aisles and out the doors. 



“It stinks!” 

“I’m sick!” 

“Somebody—help!” 

Kris tried to clamp her hand over the dummy’s mouth. But the force of 
the putrid green liquid frothing and spewing out was too strong. It pushed 
her hand away. 

Suddenly she realized she was being shoved from behind. Off the 
stage. Away from the shouting people fleeing the auditorium. Out of the 
glaring spotlight. 

She was backstage before she realized that it was Mrs. Berman who 
was pushing her. 

“I—I don’t know how you did that. Or why!” Mrs. Berman shouted 
angrily, frantically wiping splotches of the disgusting green liquid off the 
front of her dress with both hands. “But I’m going to see that you’re 
suspended from school, Kris! And if I have my way,” she sputtered, “you’ll 
be suspended for lifel” 



18 


“That’s right. Close the door,” Mr. Powell said sternly, glaring with 
narrowed eyes at Kris. 

He stood a few inches behind her, arms crossed in front of him, 
making sure she followed his instructions. She had carefully folded Mr. 
Wood in half and shoved him to the back of her closet shelf. Now she 
closed the closet, making sure it was completely shut, as he ordered. 

Lindy watched silently from her bed, her expression troubled. 

“Does the closet door lock?” Mr. Powell asked. 

“No. Not really,” Kris told him, lowering her head. 

“Well, that will have to do,” he said. “On Monday, I’m taking him 
back to the pawn shop. Do not take him out until then.” 

“But, Dad—” 

He raised a hand to silence her. 

“We have to talk about this,” Kris pleaded. “You have to listen to me. 
What happened tonight—it wasn’t a practical joke. I—” 

Her father turned away from her, a scowl on his face. “Kris, I’m sorry. 
We’ll talk tomorrow. Your mother and I—we’re both too angry and too 
upset to talk now.” 

“But, Dad—” 

Ignoring her, he stormed out of the room. She listened to his footsteps, 
hard and hurried, down the stairs. Then Kris slowly turned to Lindy. “Now 
do you believe me?” 

“I—I don’t know what to believe,” Lindy replied. “It was just so... 
unbelievably gross.” 

“Lindy, I—I—” 

“Daddy’s right. Let’s talk tomorrow,” Lindy said. “I’m sure everything 
will be clearer and calmer tomorrow.” 

But Kris couldn’t sleep. She shifted from side to side, uncomfortable, wide 
awake. She pulled the pillow over her face, held it there for a while, 
welcoming the soft darkness, then tossed it to the floor. 

I’m never going to sleep again, she thought. 



Every time she closed her eyes, she saw the hideous scene in the 
auditorium once again. She heard the astonished cries of the audience, the 
kids and their parents. And she heard the cries of shock turn to groans of 
disgust as the putrid gunk poured out over everyone. 

Sickening. So totally sickening. 

And everyone blamed her. 

My life is ruined, Kris thought. I can never go back there again. I can 
never go to school. I can never show my face anywhere. 

Ruined. My whole life. Ruined by that stupid dummy. 

In the next bed, Lindy snored softly, in a slow, steady rhythm. 

Kris turned her eyes to the bedroom window. The curtains hung down 
over the window, filtering the pale moonlight from outside. Slappy sat in 
his usual place in the chair in front of the window, bent in two, his head 
between his knees. 

Stupid dummies, Kris thought bitterly. So stupid. 

And now my life is ruined. 

She glanced at the clock. One-twenty. Outside the window, she heard a 
low, mmbling sound. A soft whistle of brakes. Probably a large truck going 

by. 

Kris yawned. She closed her eyes and saw the gross green gunk 
spewing out of Mr. Wood’s mouth. 

Will I see that every time I close my eyes? she wondered. 

What on earth was it? How could everyone blame me for something 
so... so... 

The rumbling of the tmck faded into the distance. 

But then Kris heard another sound. A rustling sound. 

A soft footstep. 

Someone was moving. 

She sucked in her breath and held it, listening hard. 

Silence now. Silence so heavy, she could hear the loud thudding of her 
heart. 

Then another soft footstep. 

A shadow moved. 

The closet door swung open. 

Or was it just shadows shifting? 

No. Someone was moving. Moving from the open closet. Someone 



was creeping toward the bedroom door. Creeping so softly, so silently. 

Her heart pounding, Kris pulled herself up, trying not to make a sound. 
Realizing that she’d been holding her breath, she let it out slowly, silently. 
She took another breath, then sat up. 

The shadow moved slowly to the door. 

Kris lowered her feet to the floor, staring hard into the darkness, her 
eyes staying with the silent, moving figure. 

What’s happening? she wondered. 

The shadow moved again. She heard a scraping sound, the sound of a 
sleeve brushing the doorframe. 

Kris pushed herself to her feet. Her legs felt shaky as she crept to the 
door, following the moving shadow. 

Out into the hallway. Even darker out here because there were no 
windows. 

Toward the stairway. 

The shadow moved more quickly now. 

Kris followed, her bare feet moving lightly over the thin carpet. 

What’s happening? What’s happening? 

She caught up to the shadowy figure on the landing. “Hey!” she called, 
her voice a tight whisper. 

She grabbed the shoulder and turned the figure around. 

And stared into the grinning face of Mr. Wood. 



19 


Mr. Wood blinked, then hissed at her, an ugly sound, a menacing sound. In 
the darkness of the stairwell, his painted grin became a threatening leer. 

In her fright, Kris squeezed the dummy’s shoulder, wrapping her 
fingers around the harsh fabric of his shirt. 

“This—this is impossible!” she whispered. 

He blinked again. He giggled. His mouth opened, making his grin 
grow wider. 

He tried to tug out of Kris’ grasp, but she hung on without even 
realizing she was holding him. 

“But—you’re a dummy!” she squealed. 

He giggled again. “So are you,” he replied. His voice was a deep 
growl, like the angry snarl of a large dog. 

“You can’t walk!” Kris cried, her voice trembling. 

The dummy giggled its ugly giggle again. 

“You can’t be alive!” Kris exclaimed. 

“Let go of me— now! ” the dummy growled. 

Kris held on, tightening her grip. “I’m dreaming,” Kris told herself 
aloud. “I have to be dreaming.” 

“I’m not a dream. I’m a nightmare!” the dummy exclaimed, and tossed 
back his wooden head, laughing. 

Still gripping the shoulder of the shirt, Kris stared through the darkness 
at the grinning face. The air seemed to grow heavy and hot. She felt as if 
she couldn’t breathe, as if she were suffocating. 

What was that sound? 

It took her a while to recognize the strained gasps of her own 
breathing. 

“Let go of me,” the dummy repeated. “Or I’ll throw you down the 
stairs.” He tried once again to tug out of her grasp. 

“No!” Kris insisted, holding tight. “I—I’m putting you back in the 
closet.” 

The dummy laughed, then pushed his painted face close to Kris’ face. 
“You can’t keep me there.” 



“I’m locking you in. I’m locking you in a box. In something !” Kris 
declared, panic clouding her thoughts. 

The darkness seemed to descend over her, choking her, weighing her 
down. 

“Let go of me.” The dummy pulled hard. 

Kris reached out her other hand and grabbed him around the waist. 

“Let go of me,” he snarled in his raspy, deep rumble of a voice. “I’m in 
charge now. You will listen to me. This is my house now.” 

He pulled hard. 

Kris encircled his waist. 

They both fell onto the stairs, rolling down a few steps. 

“Let go!” the dummy ordered. He rolled on top of her, his wild eyes 
glaring into hers. 

She pushed him off, tried to pin his arms behind his back. 

He was surprisingly strong. He pulled back one arm, then shoved a fist 
hard into the pit of her stomach. 

“Ohhh.” Kris groaned, feeling the breath knocked out of her. 

The dummy took advantage of her momentary weakness, and pulled 
free. Grasping the banister with one hand, he tried to pull himself past her 
and down the stairs. 

But Kris shot out a foot and tripped him. 

Still struggling to breathe, she pounced onto his back. Then she pulled 
him away from the banister and pushed him down hard onto a step. 

“Oh!” Kris gasped loudly as the overhead hall light flashed on. She 
closed her eyes against the sudden harsh intrusion. The dummy struggled to 
pull out from under her, but she pushed down on his back with all her 
weight. 

“Kris—what on earth—?!” Lindy’s startled voice called down from 
the top step. 

“It’s Mr. Wood!” Kris managed to cry up to her. “He’s... a/z've!” She 
pushed down hard, sprawled over the dummy, keeping him pinned beneath 
her. 

“Kris—what are you doing?” Lindy demanded. “Are you okay?” 

“No!” Kris exclaimed. “I’m not okay! Please—Lindy! Go get Mom 
and Dad! Mr. Wood—he’s alive!” 

“It’s just a dummy!” Lindy called down, taking a few reluctant steps 



toward her sister. “Get up, Kris! Have you lost your mind?” 

“Listen to me!” Kris shrieked at the top of her lungs. “Get Mom and 
Dad! Before he escapes!” 

But Lindy didn’t move. She stared down at her sister, her long hair 
falling in tangles about her face, her features twisted in horror. “Get up, 
Kris,” she urged. “Please—get up. Let’s go back to bed.” 

“I’m telling you, he’s alive!” Kris cried desperately. “You’ve got to 
believe me, Lindy. You’ve got to!” 

The dummy lay lifelessly beneath her, his face buried in the carpet, his 
arms and legs sprawled out to the sides. 

“You had a nightmare,” Lindy insisted, climbing down step by step, 
holding her long nightshirt up above her ankles until she was standing right 
above Kris. “Come back to bed, Kris. It was just a nightmare. The horrible 
thing that happened at the concert—it gave you a nightmare, that’s all.” 

Gasping for breath, Kris lifted herself up and twisted her head to face 
her sister. Grabbing the banister with one hand, she raised herself a little. 

The instant she lightened up on him, the dummy grabbed the edge of 
the stair with both hands and pulled himself out from under her. Half¬ 
falling, half-crawling, he scrambled down the rest of the stairs. 

“No! No! I don’t believe it!” Lindy shrieked, seeing the dummy move. 

“Go get Mom and Dad!” Kris said. “Hurry!” 

Her mouth wide open in shocked disbelief, Lindy turned and headed 
back up the stairs, screaming for her parents. 

Kris dived off the step, thrusting her arms in front of her. 

She tackled Mr. Wood from behind, wrapping her arms around his 
waist. 

His head hit the carpet hard as they both crumpled to the floor. 

He uttered a low, throaty cry of pain. His eyes closed. He didn’t move. 

Dazed, her chest heaving, her entire body trembling, Kris slowly 
climbed to her feet. She quickly pressed a foot on the dummy’s back to hold 
him in place. 

“Mom and Dad—where are you?” she cried aloud. “Hurry.” 

The dummy raised its head. He let out an angry growl and started to 
thrash his arms and legs wildly. 

Kris pressed her foot hard against his back. 

“Let go!” he growled viciously. 



Kris heard voices upstairs. 

“Mom? Dad? Down here!” she called up to them. 

Both of her parents appeared at the upstairs landing, their faces filled 
with worry. 

“Look!” Kris cried, frantically pointing down to the dummy beneath 
her foot. 



20 


“Look at what?” Mr. Powell cried, adjusting his pajama top. 

Kris pointed down to the dummy under her foot. “He—he’s trying to 
get away,” she stammered. 

But Mr. Wood lay lifeless on his stomach. 

“Is this supposed to be a joke?” Mrs. Powell demanded angrily, hands 
at the waist of her cotton nightgown. 

“I don’t get it,” Mr. Powell said, shaking his head. 

“Mr. Wood—he ran down the stairs,” Kris said frantically. “He’s been 
doing everything. He—” 

“This isn’t funny,” Mrs. Powell said wearily, running a hand back 
through her blonde hair. “It isn’t funny at all, Kris. Waking everyone up in 
the middle of the night.” 

“I really think you’ve lost your mind. I’m very worried about you,” 
Mr. Powell added. “I mean, after what happened at school tonight—” 

“Listen to me!” Kris shrieked. She bent down and pulled Mr. Wood up 
from the floor. Holding him by the shoulders, she shook him hard. “He 
moves! He runs! He talks! He—he’s alivel” 

She stopped shaking the dummy and let go. He slumped lifelessly to 
the floor, falling in an unmoving heap at her feet. 

“I think maybe you need to see a doctor,” Mr. Powell said, his face 
tightening with concern. 

“No. I saw him, too!” Lindy said, coming to Kris’ aid. “Kris is right. 
The dummy did move.” But then she added, “I mean, I think it moved!” 

You’re a big help, Lindy, Kris thought, suddenly feeling weak, 
drained. 

“Is this just another stupid prank?” Mrs. Powell asked angrily. “After 
what happened at school tonight, I’d think that would be enough.” 

“But, Mom—” Kris started, staring down at the lifeless heap at her 

feet. 

“Back to bed,” Mrs. Powell ordered. “There’s no school tomorrow. 
We’ll have plenty of time to discuss punishments for you two.” 

“Me?” Lindy cried, outraged. “What did / do?” 



“Mom, we’re telling the truth!” Kris insisted. 

“I still don’t get the joke,” Mr. Powell said, shaking his head. He 
turned to his wife. “Were we supposed to believe her or something?” 

“Get to bed. Both of you. Now!” their mother snapped. She and their 
father disappeared from the upstairs landing, heading angrily back down the 
hall to their room. 

Lindy remained, one hand on the top of the banister, staring down 
regretfully at Kris. 

“You believe me, don’t you?” Kris called up to her. 

“Yeah. I guess,” Lindy replied doubtfully, lowering her eyes to the 
dummy at Kris’ feet. 

Kris looked down, too. She saw Mr. Wood blink. He started to 
straighten up. 

“Whoa!” She uttered an alarmed cry and grabbed him by the neck. 
“Lindy—hurry!” she called. “He’s moving again!” 

“Wh-what should we do?” Lindy stammered, making her way 
hesitantly down the stairs. 

“I don’t know,” Kris replied as the dummy thrashed his arms and legs 
against the carpet, trying desperately to free himself from her two-handed 
grip on his neck. “We’ve got to—” 

“There’s nothing you can do,” Mr. Wood snarled. “You will be my 
slaves now. I’m alive once again! Alive!” 

“But—how?” Kris demanded, staring at him in disbelief. “I mean, 
you’re a dummy. How—?” 

The dummy snickered. “You brought me back to life,” he told her in 
his raspy voice. “You read the ancient words.” 

The ancient words? What was he talking about? 

And then Kris remembered. She had read the strange-sounding words 
from the sheet of paper in the dummy’s shirt pocket. 

“I am back, thanks to you,” the dummy growled. “And now you and 
your sister will serve me.” 

As she stared in horror at the grinning dummy, an idea popped into 
Kris’ mind. 

The paper. She had tucked it back into his pocket. 

If I read the words again, Kris thought, it will put him back to sleep. 

She reached out and grabbed him. He tried to jerk away, but she was 



too quick. 

The folded sheet of yellow paper was in her hand. 

“Give me that!” he cried. He swiped at it, but Kris swung it out of his 
reach. 

She unfolded it quickly. And before the dummy could grab the paper 
out of her hands, she read the strange words aloud: 

“Kami marri odonna loma molonu karrano.” 



21 


Both sisters stared at the dummy, waiting for him to collapse. 

But he gripped the banister and tossed his head back in an amused, 
scornful laugh. “Those are the words of the ancient sorcerer to bring me to 
life!” he proclaimed. “Those aren’t the words to kill me!” 

Kill him? 

Yes, Kris thought frantically. She tossed down the yellow paper 
disgustedly. 

We have no choice. 

“We have to kill him, Lindy.” 

“Huh?” Her sister’s face filled with surprise. 

Kris grabbed the dummy by the shoulders and held on tightly. “I’ll 
hold him. You pull his head off.” 

Lindy was beside her now. She had to duck away from Mr. Wood’s 
thrashing feet. 

“I’ll hold him still,” Kris repeated. “Grab his head. Pull it off.” 

“You—you’re sure?” Lindy hesitated, her features tight with fear. 

“Just do it! ” Kris screamed. 

She let her hands slide down around Mr. Wood’s waist. 

Lindy grabbed his head in both hands. 

“Let go of me!” the dummy rasped. 

“Pull!” Kris cried to her terrified sister. 

Holding the dummy tightly around the waist, she leaned back, pulling 
him away from her sister. 

Lindy’s hands were wrapped tightly around the dummy’s head. With a 
loud groan, she pulled hard. 

The head didn’t come off. 

Mr. Wood uttered a high-pitched giggle. “Stop. You’re tickling me!” 
he rasped. 

“Pull harder!” Kris ordered her sister. 

Lindy’s face was bright red. She tightened her grip on the head and 
pulled again, tugging with all her strength. 



The dummy giggled his shrill, unpleasant giggle. 

“It—it won’t come off,” Lindy said, sighing in defeat. 

“Twist it off!” Kris suggested frantically. 

The dummy thrashed out with his feet, kicking Kris in the stomach. 
But she held on. “Twist the head off!” she cried. 

Lindy tried to turn the head. 

The dummy giggled. 

“It won’t twist!” Lindy cried in frustration. She let go of the head and 
took a step back. 

Mr. Wood raised his head, stared up at Lindy, and grinned. “You can’t 
kill me. I have powers.” 

“What do we do?” Lindy cried, raising her eyes to Kris. 

“This is my house now,” the dummy rasped, grinning at Lindy as it 
struggled to wriggle out of Kris’ arms. “You will do as I say now. Put me 
down.” 

“What do we do?” Lindy repeated. 

“Take him upstairs. We’ll cut his head off,” Kris replied. 

Mr. Wood swung his head around, his eyes stretched open in an evil 
glare. 

“Ow!” Kris cried out in surprise as the dummy snapped his jaws over 
her arm, biting her. She pulled her arm away and, without thinking, slapped 
the dummy’s wooden head with the palm of her hand. 

The dummy giggled in response. “Violence! Violence!” he said in a 
mock scolding tone. 

“Get those sharp scissors. In your drawer,” Kris instructed her sister. 
“I’ll carry him up to our room.” 

Her arm throbbed where he had bitten her. But she held onto him 
tightly and carried him up to their bedroom. 

Lindy had already pulled the long metal scissors from the drawer. Her 
hand trembled as she opened and closed the blades. 

“Below the neck,” Kris said, holding Mr. Wood tightly by the 
shoulders. 

He hissed furiously at her. She dodged as he tried to kick her with both 
sneakered feet. 

Holding the scissors with two hands, Lindy tried cutting the head off at 
the neck. The scissors didn’t cut, so she tried a sawing motion. 



Mr. Wood giggled. “I told you. You can’t kill me.” 

“It isn’t going to work,” Lindy cried, tears of frustration running down 
her cheeks. “Now what?” 

“We’ll put him in the closet. Then we can think,” Kris replied. 

“You have no need to think. You are my slaves,” the dummy rasped. 
“You will do whatever I ask. I will be in charge from now on.” 

“No way,” Kris muttered, shaking her head. 

“What if we won’t help you?” Lindy demanded. 

The dummy turned to her, casting her a hard, angry stare. “Then I’ll 
start hurting the ones you love,” he said casually. “Your parents. Your 
friends. Or maybe that disgusting dog that’s always yapping at me.” He 
tossed back his head and a dry, evil laugh escaped his wooden lips. 

“Lock him in the closet,” Lindy suggested. “Till we figure out how to 
get rid of him.” 

“You can’t get rid of me,” Mr. Wood insisted. “Don’t make me angry. I 
have powers. I’m warning you. I’m starting to get tired of your stupid 
attempts to harm me.” 

“The closet doesn’t lock—remember?” Kris cried, struggling to hold 
onto the wriggling dummy. 

“Oh. Wait. How about this?” Lindy hurried to the closet. She pulled 
out an old suitcase from the back. 

“Perfect,” Kris said. 

“I’m warning you—” Mr. Wood threatened. “You are becoming very 
tiresome.” 

With a hard tug, he pulled himself free of Kris. 

She dove to tackle him, but he darted out from under her. She fell 
facedown onto her bed. 

The dummy ran to the center of the room, then turned his eyes to the 
doorway, as if trying to decide where to go. “You must do as I tell you,” he 
said darkly, raising a wooden hand toward Lindy. “I will not run from you 
two. You are to be my slaves.” 

“No!” Kris cried, pushing herself up. 

She and her sister both dove at the dummy. Lindy grabbed his arms. 
Kris ducked to grab his ankles. 

Working together, they stuffed him into the open suitcase. 

“You will regret this,” he threatened, kicking his legs, struggling to hit 



them. “You will pay dearly for this. Now someone will die!” He continued 
screaming after Kris latched the suitcase and shoved it into the closet. She 
quickly closed the closet door, then leaned her back against it, sighing 
wearily. 

“Now what?” she asked Lindy. 



22 


“We’ll bury him,” Kris said. 

“Huh?” Lindy stifled a yawn. 

They had been whispering together for what seemed like hours. As 
they tried to come up with a plan, they could hear the dummy’s muffled 
cries from inside the closet. 

“We’ll bury him. Under that huge mound of dirt,” Kris explained, her 
eyes going to the window. “You know. Next door, at the side of the new 
house.” 

“Yeah. Okay. I don’t know,” Lindy replied. “I’m so tired, I can’t think 
straight.” She glanced at the bed table clock. It was nearly three-thirty in the 
morning. “I still think we should wake up Mom and Dad,” Lindy said, fear 
reflected in her eyes. 

“We can’t,” Kris told her. “We’ve been over that a hundred times. 
They won’t believe us. If we wake them up, we’ll be in even bigger 
trouble.” 

“How could we be in bigger trouble?” Lindy demanded, gesturing 
with her head to the closet where Mr. Wood’s angry cries could still be 
heard. 

“Get dressed,” Kris said with renewed energy. “We’ll bury him under 
all that dirt. Then we’ll never have to think about him again.” 

Lindy shuddered and turned her eyes to her dummy, folded up in the 
chair. “I can’t bear to look at Slappy anymore. I’m so sorry I got us 
interested in dummies.” 

“Ssshhh. Just get dressed,” Kris said impatiently. 

A few minutes later, the two girls crept down the stairs in the darkness. Kris 
carried the suitcase in both arms, trying to muffle the sound of Mr. Wood’s 
angry protests. 

They stopped at the bottom of the stairs and listened for any sign that 
they had awakened their parents. 

Silence. 

Lindy pulled open the front door and they slipped outside. 



The air was surprisingly cool and wet. A heavy dew had begun to fall, 
making the front lawn glisten under the light of a half-moon. Blades of wet 
grass clung to their sneakers as they made their way to the garage. 

As Kris held onto the suitcase, Lindy slowly, quietly, pulled open the 
garage door. When it was halfway up, she ducked and slipped inside. 

A few seconds later she emerged, carrying a large snow shovel. “This 
should do it,” she said, whispering even though no one was around. 

Kris glanced down the street as they headed across the yard to the lot 
next door. The heavy morning dew misted the glow of the streetlamps, 
making the pale light appear to bend and flicker like candles. Everything 
seemed to shimmer under the dark purple sky. 

Kris set the suitcase down beside the tall mound of dirt. “We’ll dig 
right down here,” she said, pointing toward the bottom of the mound. 
“We’ll shove him in and cover him.” 

“I’m warning you,” Mr. Wood threatened, listening inside the suitcase. 
“Your plan won’t work. I have powers!” 

“You dig first,” Kris told her sister, ignoring the dummy’s threat. 
“Then I’ll take a turn.” 

Lindy dug into the pile and heaved up a shovelful of dirt. Kris 
shivered. The heavy dew felt cold and damp. A cloud floated over the 
moon, darkening the sky from purple to black. 

“Let me out!” Mr. Wood called. “Let me out now, and your 
punishment won’t be too severe.” 

“Dig faster,” Kris whispered impatiently. 

“I’m going as fast as I can,” Lindy replied. She had dug a pretty good- 
sized square-shaped hole at the base of the mound. “How much deeper, do 
you think?” 

“Deeper,” Kris said. “Here. Watch the suitcase. I’ll take a turn.” She 
changed places with Lindy and started to dig. 

Something scampered heavily near the low shrubs that separated the 
yards. Kris looked up, saw a moving shadow, and gasped. 

“Raccoon, I think,” Lindy said with a shudder. “Are we going to bury 
Mr. Wood in the suitcase, or are we going to take him out?” 

“Think Mom will notice the suitcase is gone?” Kris asked, tossing a 
shovelful of wet dirt to the side. 

Lindy shook her head. “We never use it.” 



“We’ll bury him in the suitcase,” Kris said. “It’ll be easier.” 

“You’ll be sorry,” the dummy rasped. The suitcase shook and nearly 
toppled onto its side. 

“I’m so sleepy,” Lindy moaned, tossing her socks onto the floor, then 
sliding her feet under the covers. 

“I’m wide awake,” Kris replied, sitting on the edge of her bed. “I guess 
it’s because I’m so happy. So happy we got rid of that awful creature.” 

“It’s all so weird,” Lindy said, adjusting her pillow behind her head. “I 
don’t blame Mom or Dad for not believing it. I’m not sure I believe it, 
either.” 

“You put the shovel back where you found it?” Kris asked. 

Lindy nodded. “Yeah,” she said sleepily. 

“And you closed the garage door?” 

“Ssshhh. I’m asleep,” Lindy said. “At least there’s no school 
tomorrow. We can sleep late.” 

“I hope I can fall asleep,” Kris said doubtfully. “I’m just so pumped. 
It’s all like some kind of hideously gross nightmare. I just think... Lindy? 
Lindy—are you still awake?” 

No. Her sister had fallen asleep. 

Kris stared up at the ceiling. She pulled the blankets up to her chin. 
She still felt chilled. She couldn’t shake the cold dampness of the early 
morning air. 

After a short while, with thoughts of everything that had happened that 
night whirring crazily in her head, Kris fell asleep, too. 

The rumble of machines woke her up at eight-thirty the next morning. 
Stretching, trying to rub the sleep from her eyes, Kris stumbled to the 
window, leaned over the chair holding Slappy, and peered out. 

It was a gray, cloudy day. Two enormous yellow steamrollers were 
rolling over the lot next door behind the newly constructed house, flattening 
the land. 

I wonder if they’re going to flatten that big mound of dirt, Kris 
thought, staring down at them. That would really be excellent. 

Kris smiled. She hadn’t slept very long, but she felt refreshed. 

Lindy was still sound asleep. Kris tiptoed past her, pulled her robe on, 
and headed downstairs. 



“Morning, Mom,” she called brightly, tying the belt to her robe as she 
entered the kitchen. 

Mrs. Powell turned from the sink to face her. Kris was surprised to see 
an angry expression on her face. 

She followed her mother’s stare to the breakfast counter. 

“Oh!” Kris gasped when she saw Mr. Wood. He was seated at the 
counter, his hands in his lap. His hair was matted with red-brown dirt, and 
he had dirt smears on his cheeks and forehead. 

Kris raised her hands to her face in horror. 

“I thought you were told never to bring that thing down here!” Mrs. 
Powell scolded. “What do I have to do, Kris?” She turned angrily back to 
the sink. 

The dummy winked at Kris and flashed her a wide, evil grin. 



23 


As Kris stared in horror at the grinning dummy, Mr. Powell suddenly 
appeared in the kitchen doorway. “Ready?” he asked his wife. 

Mrs. Powell hung the dishtowel on the rack and turned around, 
brushing a lock of hair off her forehead. “Ready. I’ll get my bag.” She 
brushed past him into the front hallway. 

“Where are you going?” Kris cried, her voice revealing her alarm. She 
kept her eyes on the dummy at the counter. 

“Just doing a little shopping at the garden store,” her father told her, 
stepping into the room, peering out the kitchen window. “Looks like rain.” 

“Don’t go!” Kris pleaded. 

“Huh?” He turned toward her. 

“Don’t go—please!” Kris cried. 

Her father’s eyes landed on the dummy. He walked over to him. “Hey 
—what’s the big idea?” her father asked angrily. 

“I thought you wanted to take him back to the pawn shop,” Kris 
replied, thinking quickly. 

“Not till Monday,” her father replied. “Today is Saturday, remember?” 

The dummy blinked. Mr. Powell didn’t notice. 

“Do you have to go shopping now?” Kris asked in a tiny voice. 

Before her father could answer, Mrs. Powell reappeared in the 
doorway. “Here. Catch,” she called, and tossed the car keys to him. “Let’s 
go before it pours.” 

Mr. Powell started to the door. “Why don’t you want us to go?” he 
asked. 

“The dummy—” Kris started. But she knew it was hopeless. They’d 
never listen. They’d never believe her. “Never mind,” she muttered. 

A few seconds later, she heard their car back down the driveway. They 
were gone. 

And she was alone in the kitchen with the grinning dummy. 

Mr. Wood turned toward her slowly, swiveling the tall counter stool. 
His big eyes locked angrily on Kris’. 

“I warned you,” he rasped. 



Barky came trotting into the kitchen, his toenails clicking loudly on the 
linoleum. He sniffed the floor as he ran, searching for breakfast scraps 
someone might have dropped. 

“Barky, where’ve you been?” Kris asked, glad to have company. 

The dog ignored her and sniffed under the stool Mr. Wood sat on. 

“He was upstairs, waking me up,” Lindy said, rubbing her eyes as she 
walked into the kitchen. She was wearing white tennis shorts and a 
sleeveless magenta T-shirt. “Stupid dog.” 

Barky licked at a spot on the linoleum. 

Lindy cried out as she spotted Mr. Wood. “Oh, no!” 

“I’m back,” the dummy rasped. “And I’m very unhappy with you two 
slaves.” 

Lindy turned to Kris, her mouth open in surprise and terror. 

Kris kept her eyes trained on the dummy. What does he plan to do? 
she wondered. How can I stop him? 

Burying him under all that dirt hadn’t kept him from returning. 
Somehow he had freed himself from the suitcase and pulled himself out. 

Wasn’t there any way to defeat him? Any way at all? 

Grinning his evil grin, Mr. Wood dropped down to the floor, his 
sneakers thudding hard on the floor. “I’m very unhappy with you two 
slaves,” he repeated in his growly voice. 

“What are you going to do?” Lindy cried in a shrill, frightened voice. 

“I have to punish you,” the dummy replied. “I have to prove to you 
that I am serious.” 

“Wait!” Kris cried. 

But the dummy moved quickly. He reached down and grabbed Barky 
by the neck with both hands. 

As the dummy tightened his grip, the frightened terrier began to howl 
in pain. 



24 


“I warned you,” Mr. Wood snarled over the howls of the little black terrier. 
“You will do as I say—or one by one, those you love will suffer!” 

“No!” Kris cried. 

Barky let out a high-pitched whelp, a bleat of pain that made Kris 
shudder. 

“Let go of Barky!” Kris screamed. 

The dummy giggled. 

Barky uttered a hoarse gasp. 

Kris couldn’t stand it any longer. She and Lindy leapt at the dummy 
from two sides. Lindy tackled his legs. Kris grabbed Barky and tugged. 

Lindy dragged the dummy to the floor. But his wooden hands held a 
tight grip on the dog’s throat. 

Barky’s howls became a muffled whimper as he struggled to breathe. 

“Let go! Let go!” Kris shrieked. 

“I warned you!” the dummy snarled as Lindy held tight to his kicking 
legs. “The dog must die now!” 

“No!” Kris let go of the gasping dog. She slid her hands down to the 
dummy’s wrists. Then with a fierce tug, she pulled the wooden hands apart. 

Barky dropped to the floor, wheezing. He scampered to the corner, his 
paws sliding frantically over the smooth floor. 

“You’ll pay now!” Mr. Wood growled. Jerking free from Kris, he 
swung his wooden hand up, landing a hard blow on Kris’ forehead. 

She cried out in pain and raised her hands to her head. 

She heard Barky yipping loudly behind her. 

“Let go of me!” Mr. Wood demanded, turning back to Lindy, who still 
held onto his legs. 

“No way!” Lindy cried. “Kris—grab his arms again.” 

Her head still throbbing, Kris lunged forward to grab the dummy’s 
arms. 

But he lowered his head as she approached and clamped his wooden 
jaws around her wrist. 



“Owww!” Kris howled in pain and pulled back. 

Lindy lifted the dummy up by the legs, then slammed his body hard 
against the floor. He uttered a furious growl and tried to kick free of her. 

Kris lunged again, and this time grabbed one arm, then the other. He 
lowered his head to bite once more, but she dodged away and pulled his 
arms tight behind his back. 

“I’m warning you!” he bellowed. “I’m warning you!” 

Barky yipped excitedly, hopping up on Kris. 

“What do we do with him?” Lindy cried, shouting over the dummy’s 
angry threats. 

“Outside!” Kris yelled, pressing the arms more tightly behind Mr. 
Wood’s back. 

She suddenly remembered the two steamrollers she had seen moving 
over the yard next door, flattening the ground. “Come on,” she urged her 
sister. “We’ll crush him!” 

“I’m warning you! I have powers!” the dummy screamed. 

Ignoring him, Kris pulled open the kitchen door and they carried their 
wriggling captive outside. 

The sky was charcoal-gray. A light rain had begun to fall. The grass 
was already wet. 

Over the low shrubs that separated the yards, the girls could see the 
two enormous yellow steamrollers, one in the back, one at the side of the 
next-door lot. They looked like huge, lumbering animals, their giant black 
rollers flattening everything in their path. 

“This way! Hurry!” Kris shouted to her sister, holding the dummy 
tightly as she ran. “Toss him under that one! ” 

“Let me go! Let me go, slaves!” the dummy screamed. “This is your 
last chance!” He swung his head hard, trying to bite Kris’ arm. 

Thunder rumbled, low in the distance. 

The girls ran at full speed, slipping on the wet grass as they hurried 
toward the fast-moving steamroller. 

They were just a few yards away from the enormous machine when 
they saw Barky. His tail wagging furiously, he scampered ahead of them. 

“Oh, no! How’d he get out?” Lindy cried. 

Gazing back at them, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, prancing 
happily in the wet grass, the dog was running right into the path of the 



rumbling steamroller. 

“No, Barky!” Kris shrieked in horror. “No! Barky—no!” 



25 


Letting go of Mr. Wood, both girls dove toward the dog. Hands 
outstretched, they slid on their stomachs on the wet grass. 

Unaware of any problem, enjoying the game of tag, Barky scampered 
away. 

Lindy and Kris rolled out of the path of the steamroller. 

“Hey—get away from there!” the angry operator shouted through the 
high window of the steamroller. “Are you girls crazy?” 

They leapt to their feet and turned back to Mr. Wood. 

The rain began to come down a little harder. A jagged streak of white 
lightning flashed high in the sky. 

“I’m free!” the dummy cried, hands raised victoriously above his head. 
“Now you will pay!” 

“Get him!” Kris shouted to her sister. 

The rain pelted their hair and shoulders. The two girls lowered their 
heads, leaned into the rain, and began to chase after the dummy. 

Mr. Wood turned and started to run. 

He never saw the other steamroller. 

The gigantic black wheel rolled right over him, pushing him onto his 
back, then crushing him with a loud crunch. 

A loud hiss rose up from under the machine, like air escaping from a 
large balloon. 

The steamroller appeared to rock back and forth. 

A strange green gas spurted up from beneath the wheel, into the air, 
spreading out in an eerie, mushroom-shaped cloud. 

Barky stopped scampering and stood frozen in place, his eyes 
following the green gas as it floated up against the nearly black sky. 

Lindy and Kris stared in open mouthed wonder. 

Pushed by the wind and the rain, the green gas floated over them. 

“Yuck! It stinks!” Lindy declared. 

It smelled like rotten eggs. 

Barky uttered a low whimper. 



The steamroller backed up. The driver jumped out and came running 
toward them. He was a short, stocky man with big, muscular arms bulging 
out from the sleeves of his T-shirt. His face was bright red under a short, 
blond flattop, his eyes wide with horror. 

“A kid?” he cried. “I—I ran over a kid?” 

“No. He was a dummy,” Kris told him. “He wasn’t alive.” 

He stopped. His face faded from red to flour-white. He uttered a loud, 
grateful sigh. “Oh, man,” he moaned. “Oh, man. I thought it was a kid.” 

He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Then he bent to examine 
the area beneath his wheel. As the girls came near, they saw the remains of 
the dummy, crushed flat inside its jeans and flannel shirt. 

“Hey, I’m real sorry,” the man said, wiping his forehead with his T- 
shirt sleeve as he straightened up to face them. “I couldn’t stop in time.” 

“That’s okay,” Kris said, a wide smile forming on her face. 

“Yeah. Really. It’s okay,” Lindy quickly agreed. 

Barky moved close to sniff the crushed dummy. 

The man shook his head. “I’m so relieved. It looked like it was 
running. I really thought it was a kid. I was so scared.” 

“No. Just a dummy,” Kris told him. 

“Whew!” The man exhaled slowly. “Close one.” His expression 
changed. “What are you girls doing out in the rain, anyway?” 

Lindy shrugged. Kris shook her head. “Just walking the dog.” 

The man picked up the crushed dummy. The head crumbled to powder 
as he lifted it. “You want this thing?” 

“You can throw it in the trash,” Kris told him. 

“Better get out of the rain,” he told them. “And don’t scare me like that 
again.” 

The girls apologized, then headed back to the house. Kris cast a happy 
grin at her sister. Lindy grinned back. 

I may grin forever, Kris thought. I’m so happy. So relieved. 

They wiped their wet sneakers on the mat, then held the kitchen door 
open for Barky. “Wow. What a morning!” Lindy declared. 

They followed the dog into the kitchen. Outside, a flash of bright 
lightning was followed by a roar of thunder. 

“I’m drenched,” Kris said. “I’m going up to get changed.” 

“Me, too.” Lindy followed her up the stairs. 



They entered their bedroom to find the window wide open, the curtains 
slapping wildly, rain pouring in. “Oh, no!” Kris hurried across the room to 
shut the window. 

As she leaned over the chair to grab the window frame, Slappy 
reached up and grabbed her arm. 

“Hey, slave—is that other guy gone?” the dummy asked in a throaty 
growl. “I thought he’d never leave!” 





THE WEREWOLF 
OF FEVER SWAMP 


Goosebumps - 14 
R.L. Stine 



1 


We moved to Florida during Christmas vacation. A week later, I heard the 
frightening howls in the swamp for the first time. 

Night after night, the howls made me sit up in bed. I would hold my 
breath and wrap my arms around myself to keep from shivering. 

I would stare out my bedroom window at the chalk-colored full moon. 
And I would listen. 

What kind of creature makes such a cry? I would ask myself. 

And how close is it? Why does it sound as if it’s right outside my 
window? 

The wails rose and fell like police car sirens. They weren’t sad or 
mournful. They were menacing. 

Angry. 

They sounded to me like a warning. Stay out of the swamp. You do not 
belong here. 

When my family first moved to Florida, to our new house at the edge 
of the swamp, I couldn’t wait to explore. I stood in the back yard with the 
binoculars my dad had given me for my twelfth birthday and gazed toward 
the swamp. 

Trees with slender, white trunks tilted over each other. Their flat, broad 
leaves appeared to form a roof, covering the swamp floor in blue shadow. 

Behind me, the deer paced uneasily in their wire-mesh pen. I could 
hear them pawing the soft, sandy ground, mbbing their antlers against the 
walls of their pen. 

Lowering my binoculars, I turned to look at them. The deer were the 
reason we had moved to Florida. 

You see, my dad, Michael F. Tucker, is a scientist. He works for the 
University of Vermont in Burlington, which, believe me, is a long way from 
the Florida swamps! 

Dad got these six deer from some country in South America. They’re 
called swamp deer. They’re not like regular deer. I mean, they don’t look 
like Bambi. For one thing, their fur is very red, not brown. And their hooves 
are really big and kind of webbed. For walking on wet, swampy ground, I 



guess. 

Dad wants to see if these South American swamp deer can survive in 
Florida. He plans to put little radio transmitters on them, and set them free 
in the swamp. Then he’ll study how they get along. 

When he told us back in Burlington that we were moving to Florida 
because of the deer, we all totally freaked. We didn’t want to move. 

My sister, Emily, cried for days. She’s sixteen, and she didn’t want to 
miss her senior year in high school. I didn’t want to leave my friends, either. 

But Dad quickly got Mom on his side. Mom is a scientist, too. She and 
Dad work together on a lot of projects. So, of course, she agreed with him. 

And the two of them tried to persuade Emily and me that this was the 
chance of a lifetime, that it was going to be really exciting. An adventure 
we’d never forget. 

So here we were, living in a little white house in a neighborhood of 
four or five other little white houses. We had six weird-looking red deer 
penned up behind the house. The hot Florida sun was beaming down. And 
an endless swamp stretched beyond our flat, grassy back yard. 

I turned away from the deer and raised the binoculars to my face. 
“Oh,” I cried out as two dark eyes seemed to be staring back at me. 

I pulled the binoculars away and squinted toward the swamp. In the 
near distance I saw a large white bird on two long, spindly legs. 

“It’s a crane,” Emily said. I hadn’t realized Emily had stepped up 
beside me. She was wearing a sleeveless white T-shirt and short red denim 
shorts. My sister is tall and thin and very blonde. She looks a lot like a 
crane. 

The bird turned and began high-stepping toward the swamp. 

“Let’s follow it,” I said. 

Emily made her pouting face, an expression we’d all seen a lot of since 
moving down here. “No way. It’s too hot.” 

“Aw, come on.” I tugged her skinny arm. “Let’s do some exploring, 
check out the swamp.” 

She shook her head, her white-blonde ponytail swinging behind her. “I 
really don’t want to, Grady.” She adjusted her sunglasses on her nose. “I’m 
kind of waiting for the mail.” 

Since we’re so far from the nearest post office, we only get mail two 
times a week. Emily had been spending most of her time waiting for the 



mail. 

“Waiting for a love letter from Martin?” I asked with a grin. She hated 
when I teased her about Martin, her boyfriend back in Burlington. So I 
teased her as often as I could. 

“Maybe,” she said. She reached out with both hands and messed up 
my hair. She knows I hate to have my hair messed up. 

“Please?” I pleaded. “Come on, Emily. Just a short walk. Very short.” 

“Emily, take a short walk with Grady,” Dad’s voice broke in. We 
turned to see him inside the deer pen. He had a clipboard in one hand and 
was going from deer to deer, taking notes. “Go ahead,” he urged my sister. 
“You’re not doing anything else.” 

“But, Dad—” Emily could whine with the best of them when she 
wanted. 

“Go ahead, Em,” Dad insisted. “It will be interesting. More interesting 
than standing around in the heat arguing with him.” 

Emily pushed the sunglasses up again. They kept slipping down her 
nose. “Well...” 

“Great!” I cried. I was really excited. I’d never been in a real swamp 
before. “Let’s go!” I grabbed my sister’s hand and pulled. 

Emily reluctantly followed, a fretful expression on her face. “I have a 
bad feeling about this,” she muttered. 

My shadow slanting behind me, I hurried toward the low, tilting trees. 
“Emily, what could go wrong?” I asked. 



2 


It was hot and wet under the trees. The air felt sticky against my face. The 
broad palm leaves were so low, I could almost reach up and touch them. 
They nearly blocked out the sun, but shafts of yellow light broke through, 
beaming down on the swamp floor like spotlights. 

Scratchy weeds and fern leaves brushed against my bare legs. I wished 
I’d worn jeans instead of shorts. I kept close to my sister as we made our 
way along a narrow, winding trail. The binoculars, strapped around my 
neck, began to feel heavy against my chest. I should’ve left them at home, I 
realized. 

“It’s so noisy here,” Emily complained, stepping over a decaying log. 

She was right. The most surprising thing about the swamp was all the 
sounds. 

A bird trilled from somewhere above. Another bird replied with a shrill 
whistle. Insects chittered loudly all around us. I heard a steady tap-tap-tap, 
like someone hammering on wood. A woodpecker? Palm leaves crackled as 
they swayed. Slender tree trunks creaked. My sandals made thup thup 
sounds, sinking into the marshy ground as I walked. 

“Hey, look,” Emily said, pointing. She pulled off her dark glasses to 
see better. 

We had come to a small, oval-shaped pond. The water was dark green, 
half-hidden in shade. Floating on top were white water lilies, bending 
gracefully over flat, green lily pads. 

“Pretty,” Emily said, brushing a bug off her shoulder. “I’m going to 
come back here with my camera and take pictures of this pond. Look at the 
great light.” 

I followed her gaze. The near end of the pond was darkened by long 
shadows. But light slanted down through the trees at the other end, forming 
what looked like a bright curtain that spilled into the still pond water. 

“It is kind of cool,” I admitted. I wasn’t really into ponds. I was more 
interested in wildlife. 

I let Emily admire the pond and the water lilies a little longer. Then I 
headed around the pond and deeper into the swamp. 



My sandals slapped over the wet ground. Up ahead, a swarm of tiny 
gnats, thousands of them, danced silently in a shaft of sunlight. 

“Yuck,” Emily muttered. “I hate gnats. It makes me itchy just to look 
at them.” She scratched her arms. 

We turned away—and both saw something scamper behind a fallen, 
moss-covered log. 

“Hey—what was that?” Emily cried, grabbing my elbow. 

“An alligator!” I shouted. “Ahungry alligator!” 

She uttered a short, frightened cry. 

I laughed. “What’s your problem, Em? It was just some kind of 
lizard.” 

She squeezed my arm hard, trying to make me flinch. “You’re a creep, 
Grady,” she muttered. She scratched her arms some more. “It’s too itchy in 
this swamp,” she complained. “Let’s head back.” 

“Just a little bit farther,” I pleaded. 

“No. Come on. I really want to get back.” She tried to pull me, but I 
backed out of her grasp. “Grady—” 

I turned and started walking away from her, deeper into the swamp. I 
heard the tap-tap-tap again, directly overhead. The low palm leaves scraped 
against each other, shifting in a soft, wet breeze. The shrill cluttering of the 
insects grew louder. 

“I’m going home and leaving you here,” Emily threatened. 

I ignored her and kept walking. I knew she was bluffing. 

My sandals crackled over dried, brown palm leaves. Without turning 
around, I could hear Emily a few steps behind me. 

Another little lizard scampered across the path, just in front of my 
sandals. It looked like a dark arrow, shooting into the underbrush. 

The ground suddenly sloped upward. We found ourselves climbing a 
low hill into bright sunlight. A clearing of some sort. 

Beads of sweat ran down my cheeks. The air was so wet, I felt as if I 
were swimming. 

At the top of the hill, we stopped to look around. “Hey—another 
pond!” I cried, running over fat, yellow swamp grass, hurrying up to the 
water’s edge. 

But this pond looked different. 

The dark green water wasn’t flat and smooth. Leaning over it, I could 



see that it was murky and thick, like split-pea soup. It made disgusting 
gurgling and plopping sounds as it churned. 

I leaned down closer to get a better look. 

“It’s quicksand!” I heard Emily cry in horror. 

And then two hands shoved me hard from behind. 



3 


As I started to fall into the bubbling green stew, the same hands grabbed my 
waist and pulled me back. 

Emily giggled. “Gotcha!” she cried, holding on to me, keeping me 
from turning around and slugging her. 

“Hey—let go!” I cried angrily. “You almost pushed me into quicksand ! 
That’s not funny!” 

She laughed some more, then let me go. “It isn’t quicksand, dork,” she 
muttered. “It’s a bog.” 

“Huh?” I turned to stare into the gloppy green water. 

“It’s a bog. A peat bog,” she repeated impatiently. “Don’t you know 
anything?” 

“What’s a peat bog?” I asked, ignoring her insults. Emily the Know-It- 
All. She’s always bragging about how she knows everything and I’m a 
stupid clod. But she gets B’s in school, and I get A’s. So who’s the smart 
one? 

“We learned about this last year when we studied the wetlands and rain 
forests,” she replied smugly. “The pond is thick because it has peat moss 
growing in it. The moss grows and grows. It absorbs twenty-five times its 
own weight in water.” 

“It’s gross-looking,” I said. 

“Why don’t you drink some and see how it tastes,” she urged. 

She tried to push me again, but I ducked and skirted away. “I’m not 
thirsty,” I muttered. I realize it wasn’t too clever, but it was the best reply I 
could think of. 

“Let’s get going,” she said, wiping sweat off her forehead with her 
hand. “I’m really hot.” 

“Yeah. Okay,” I reluctantly agreed. “This was a pretty neat walk.” 

We turned away from the peat bog and started back down the hill. 
“Hey, look!” I cried, pointing to two black shadows floating high above us 
under a white cloud. 

“Falcons,” Emily said, shielding her eyes with one hand as she gazed 
up. “I think they’re falcons. It’s hard to see. They sure are big.” 



We watched them soar out of sight. Then we continued down the hill, 
making our way carefully on the damp, sandy ground. 

At the bottom of the hill, back under the deep shade of the trees, we 
stopped to catch our breath. 

I was really sweating now. The back of my neck felt hot and itchy. I 
mbbed it with one hand, but it didn’t seem to help. 

The breeze had stopped. The air felt heavy. Nothing moved. 

Loud cawing sounds made me glance up. Two enormous blackbirds 
peered down at us from a low branch of a cypress tree. They cawed again, 
as if telling us to go away. 

“This way,” Emily said with a sigh. 

I followed her, feeling prickly and itchy all over. “I wish we had a 
swimming pool at our new house,” I said. “I’d jump right in with my 
clothes on!” 

We walked for several minutes. The trees grew thicker. The light grew 
dimmer. The path ended. We had to push our way through tall, leafy ferns. 

“I—I don’t think we’ve been here before,” I stammered. “I don’t think 
this is the right way.” 

We stared at each other, watching each other’s face fill with fright. 

We both realized we were lost. Completely lost.

“I don’t believe this!” Emily shrieked. 

Her loud shout made the two blackbirds flutter off their tree limb. 
They soared away, cawing angrily. 

“What am I doing here?” she cried. Emily is not good in emergencies. 
When she got a flat tire during one of her first driving lessons back home in 
Burlington, she jumped out of the car and ran away! 

So I didn’t exactly expect her to be calm and cool now. Since we were 
totally lost in the middle of a dark, hot swamp, I expected her to panic. And 
she did. 

I’m the calm one in the family. I take after Dad. Cool and scientific. 
“Let’s just figure out the direction of the sun,” I said, ignoring the fluttering 
in my chest. 

“What sun?” Emily cried, throwing her hands up. 

It was really dark. The palm trees with their wide leaves formed a 
pretty solid roof above us. 

“Well, we could check out some moss,” I suggested. The fluttering in 
my chest was growing stronger. “Isn’t moss supposed to grow on the north 
side of trees?” 

“East side, I think,” Emily muttered. “Or is it the west?” 

“I’m pretty sure it’s the north,” I insisted, gazing around. 

“Pretty sure? What good is pretty sure?” Emily cried shrilly. 

“Forget the moss,” I said, rolling my eyes. “I’m not even sure what 
moss looks like.” 

We stared at each other for a long time. 

“Didn’t you used to carry a compass with you wherever you went?” 
Emily asked, sounding a little shaky. 

“Yeah. When I was four,” I replied. 

“I can’t believe we were so stupid,” Emily wailed. “We should have 
worn one of the radio transmitters. You know. For the deer. Then Dad could 
track us down.” 

“I should have worn jeans,” I muttered, noticing some tiny red bumps 
along my calf. Poison ivy? Some kind of rash? 



“What should we do?” Emily asked impatiently, wiping sweat off her 
forehead with her hand. 

“Go back up the hill, I guess,” I told her. “There were no trees there. It 
was sunny. Once we see where the sun is, we can figure out the direction to 
get back.” 

“But which way is the hill?” Emily demanded. 

I spun around. Was it behind us? To our right? A cold chill ran down 
my back as I realized I wasn’t sure. 

I shrugged. “We’re really lost,” I murmured with a sigh. 

“Let’s go this way,” Emily said, starting to walk away. “I just have a 
feeling this is the way. If we come to that bog, we’ll know we’re going 
right.” 

“And if we don’t?” I demanded. 

“We’ll come to something else, maybe,” she replied. 

Brilliant. 

But I didn’t see any good in arguing with her. So I followed. 

We walked in silence, the shrill ringing of the insects on all sides, the 
calls of birds startling us from above. After a short while, we pushed our 
way through a clump of tall, stiff reeds. 

“Have we been here before?” Emily asked. 

I couldn’t remember. I pushed a reed away to step through and realized 
it had left something sticky on my hand. “Yuck!” 

“Hey, look!” Emily’s excited cry made me glance up from the sticky 
green gunk that clung to my hand. 

The bog! It was right in front of us. The same bog we had stopped at 
before. 

“Yay!” Emily cried. “I knew I was right. I just had a feeling.” 

The sight of the gurgling green pond cheered us both up. Once past it, 
we began to run. We knew we were on the right path, nearly home. 

“Way to go!” I cried happily, running past my sister. “Way to go!” 

I was feeling really good again. 

Then something reached up, grabbed my ankle, and pulled me down to 
the swampy ground. 



5 


I hit the ground hard, landing on my elbows and knees. 

My heart leapt into my mouth. 

I tasted blood. 

“Get up! Get up!” Emily was screaming. 

“It—it’s got me!” I cried in a tight, trembling voice. 

The fluttering in my chest had become a pounding. Again, I tasted 
blood. 

I raised my eyes to see Emily laughing. 

Laughing? 

“It’s just a tree root,” she said, pointing. 

I followed the direction of her finger—and instantly realized I hadn’t 
been pulled down. I had tripped over one of the many upraised tree roots 
that arched over the ground. 

I stared at the bonelike root. It was bent in the middle and looked like a 
skinny, white leg. 

But what was the blood I tasted? 

I felt my aching lip. I had bitten it when I fell. 

With a loud groan, I pulled myself to my feet. My knees ached. My lip 
throbbed. Blood trickled down my chin. 

“That was pretty clumsy,” Emily said softly. And then she added, “Are 
you okay?” She brushed some dried leaves off the back of my T-shirt. 

“Yeah, I guess,” I replied, still feeling a little shaky. “I really thought 
something had grabbed me.” I forced a laugh. 

She rested a hand on my shoulder, and we started walking again, 
slower than before, side by side. 

Slender beams of light poked down through the thick tree leaves, 
dotting the ground in front of us. It all looked unreal, like something in a 
dream. 

Some creature scampered noisily behind the tangle of low shrubs at 
our right. Emily and I didn’t even turn to try to see it. We just wanted to get 
home. 

It didn’t take us long to realize we were headed in the wrong direction. 



We stopped at the edge of a small, round clearing. Birds chattered 
noisily above us. A light breeze made the palm leaves scrape and creak. 

“What are those huge gray things?” I asked, lingering behind my 
sister. 

“Mushrooms, I think,” she replied quietly. 

“Mushrooms as big as footballs,” I murmured. 

We both saw the small shack at the same time. 

It was hidden in the shadow of two low cypress trees beyond the field 
of giant mushrooms at the other side of the clearing. 

We both gaped at it in surprise, studying it in shocked silence. We took 
a few steps toward it. Then a few more. 

The shack was tiny, built low to the ground, not much taller than me. It 
had some kind of thatched roof, made of long reeds or dried grass. The 
walls were made of layers of dried palm leaves. 

The door, built of slender tree limbs bound together, was shut tight. 
There were no windows. 

A pile of gray ashes formed a circle a few yards from the door. Signs 
of a campfire. 

I saw a pair of battered, old workboots lying at the side of the shack. 
Beside them were several empty tin cans on their sides and a plastic water 
bottle, also empty, partly crumpled. 

I turned to Emily and whispered, “Do you think someone lives here? 
In the middle of the swamp?” 

She shrugged, her features tight with fear. 

“If someone lives here, maybe he can tell us which way to go to get 
home,” I suggested. 

“Maybe,” Emily murmured. Her eyes were straight ahead on the tiny 
shack covered in blue shadow. 

We took another couple of steps closer. 

Why would someone want to live in a tiny shack like this in the middle 
of a swamp? I wondered. 

An answer flashed into my mind: Because whoever it is wants to hide 
from the world. 

“It’s a hideout,” I muttered, not realizing I was speaking out loud. “A 
criminal. A bank robber. Or a killer. He’s hiding here.” 

“Sshhh. ” Emily put a finger on my mouth to silence me, hitting the cut 



on my lip. I pulled away. 

“Anyone home?” she called. Her voice came out low and shaky, so 
low I could barely hear her. “Anyone home?” she repeated, a little more 
forcefully. 

I decided to join in. We shouted together: “Anyone home? Anyone in 
there?” 

We listened. 

No reply. 

We stepped up to the low door. 

“Anyone in there?” I called one more time. 

Then I reached for the doorknob. 



6 


Just as I was about to pull open the crude wooden door, it swung out, nearly 
hitting us both. We leapt back as a man burst out from the dark doorway of 
the hut. 

He glared at us with wild black eyes. He had long, gray-white hair, 
down past his shoulders, tied behind him in a loose ponytail. 

His face was bright red, sunburned, maybe. Or maybe red from anger. 
He stared at us with a menacing scowl, standing bent over, stooped from 
being inside the low hut. 

He wore a loose-fitting white T-shirt, dirt-stained and wrinkled, over 
heavy black trousers that bagged over his sandals. 

As he glared at us with those amazing black eyes, his mouth opened, 
revealing rows of jagged yellow teeth. 

Huddling close to my sister, I took a step back. 

I wanted to ask him who he was, why he lived in the swamp. I wanted 
to ask if he could help us find our way back home. 

A dozen questions flashed through my mind. 

But all I could utter was, “Uh... sorry.” 

Then I realized that Emily was already running away. Her ponytail 
flew behind her as she dived through the tall weeds. 

And a second later, I was running after her. My heart pounded. My 
sandals squished over the soft ground. 

“Hey, Emily—wait up! Wait up!” 

I ran over the rough carpet of dead leaves and twigs. 

As I struggled to catch up to her, I glanced behind me—and cried out 
in terror. “Emily—he’s chasing us!” 



7 


Bent low to the ground, the man from the hut moved steadily after us, 
taking long strides. His hands bobbed at his sides. He was breathing hard, 
and his mouth was open, revealing the jagged teeth. 

“Run!” Emily cried. “Run, Grady!” 

We were following a narrow path between tall weeds. The trees 
thinned out. We ran through shadow and sunlight and back into shadow. 

“Emily—wait up!” I called breathlessly. But she didn’t slow down. 

A long, narrow pond appeared to our left. Strange trees lifted up from 
the middle of the water. The slender trunks were surrounded by a thicket of 
dark roots. Mangrove trees. 

I wanted to stop and look at the eerie-looking trees. But this wasn’t the 
time for sightseeing. 

We ran along the edge of the pond, our sandals sinking into the marshy 
ground. Then, my chest heaving, my throat choked and dry, I followed 
Emily as the path curved into the trees. 

A sharp pain in my side made me cry out. I stopped running. I gasped 
for breath. 

“Hey—he’s gone,” Emily said, swallowing hard. She stopped a few 
yards ahead of me and leaned against a tree trunk. “We lost him.” 

I bent over, trying to force away the pain in my side. After a short 
while, my breathing slowed to normal. “Weird,” I said. I couldn’t think of 
anything else. 

“Yeah. Weird,” Emily agreed. She walked back to me and pulled me 
up straight. “You okay?” 

“I guess.” At least the pain had faded away. I always get a pain in my 
right side when I run a long time. This one was worse than usual. I usually 
don’t have to run for my life! 

“Come on,” Emily said. She let go of me and started walking quickly, 
following the path. 

“Hey, this looks familiar,” I said. I began to feel a little better. I started 
to jog. We passed clusters of trees and ferns that looked familiar. I could see 
our footprints in the sandy ground, going the other way. 



A short while later, our back yard came into view. “Home sweet 
home!” I cried. 

Emily and I stepped out from the low trees and began running across 
the grass toward the back of the house. 

Mom and Dad were in the back yard setting up outdoor furniture. Dad 
was lowering an umbrella into the white umbrella table. Mom was washing 
off the white lawn chairs with the garden hose. 

“Hey—welcome back,” Dad said, smiling. 

“We thought you got lost,” Mom said. 

“We did!” I cried breathlessly. 

Mom turned off the nozzle, stopping the spray of water. “You what?” 

“A man chased us!” Emily exclaimed. “A strange man with long white 
hair.” 

“He lives in a hut. In the middle of the swamp,” I added, dropping 
down into one of the lawn chairs. It was wet, but I didn’t care. 

“Huh? He chased you?” Dad’s eyes narrowed in alarm. Then he said, 
“I heard in town there’s a swamp hermit out there.” 

“Yes, he chased us!” Emily repeated. Her normally pale face was 
bright red. Her hair had come loose and fell wildly around her face. “It—it 
was scary.” 

“A guy in the hardware store told me about him,” Dad said. “Said he 
was strange, but perfectly harmless. No one knows his name.” 

“Harmless?” Emily cried. “Then why did he chase us?” 

Dad shrugged. “I’m only repeating what I heard. Evidently he’s lived 
in the swamp most of his life. By himself. He never comes to town.” 

Mom dropped the hose and walked over to Emily. She placed a hand 
on Emily’s shoulder. In the bright sunlight, they looked like sisters. They’re 
both tall and thin, with long, straight blonde hair. I look more like my dad. 
Wavy brown hair. Dark eyes. A little chunky. 

“Maybe they shouldn’t go back in the swamp by themselves,” Mom 
said, biting her lower lip fretfully. She started to gather Emily’s hair back up 
into a ponytail. 

“The hermit is supposed to be completely harmless,” Dad repeated. He 
was still struggling to lower the umbrella into the concrete base. Every time 
he lowered it, he missed the opening. 

“Here, Dad. I’ll help you.” I scooted under the table and guided the 



umbrella stem into the base. 

“Don’t worry,” Emily said. “You won’t catch me back in that swamp.” 
She scratched both shoulders. “I’m going to be itchy for the rest of my 
life!” she groaned. 

“We saw a lot of neat things,” I said, starting to feel normal again. “A 
peat bog and mangrove trees...” 

“I told you this was going to be an experience,” Dad said, arranging 
the white chairs around the table. 

“Some experience,” Emily grumbled, rolling her eyes. “I’m going in to 
take a shower. Maybe if I stay in it for an hour or so, I’ll stop itching.” 

Mom shook her head, watching Emily stomp toward the back door. 
“This is going to be a hard year for Em,” she muttered. 

Dad wiped his dirty hands on the sides of his jeans. “Come with me, 
Grady,” he said, motioning for me to follow him. “Time to feed the deer.” 

We talked more about the swamp at dinner. Dad told us stories about how 
they hunted and trapped the swamp deer that he was using for his 
experiment. 

Dad and his helpers searched the South American jungles for weeks. 
They used tranquilizer guns to capture the deer. Then they had to bring in 
helicopters to pull the deer out, and the deer were not too happy about 
flying. 

“The swamp you two were exploring this afternoon,” he said, twirling 
his spaghetti. “Know what it’s called? Fever Swamp. That’s what the local 
people call it, anyway.” 

“Why?” Emily asked. “Because it’s so hot in there?” 

Dad chewed and swallowed a mouthful of spaghetti. He had orange 
splotches of tomato sauce on both sides of his mouth. “I don’t know why 
it’s called Fever Swamp. But I’m sure we’ll find out eventually.” 

“It was probably discovered by a guy named Mr. Fever,” Mom joked. 

“I want to go home to Vermont!” Emily wailed. 

After dinner, I found myself feeling a little homesick, too. I took a tennis 
ball out to the back of the house. I thought maybe I could bounce it off the 
wall and catch it the way I had done back home. 

But the deer pen was in the way. 



I thought about my two best friends back in Burlington, Ben and 
Adam. We had lived on the same block and used to hang out after dinner. 
We’d throw a ball around or walk down to the playground and just mess 
around. 

Staring at the deer, who milled silently at one end of the pen, I realized 
I really missed my friends. I wondered what they were doing right now. 
Probably hanging out in Ben’s back yard. 

Feeling glum, I was about to go back inside and see what was on TV 
—when a hand grabbed me from behind. 

The swamp hermit! 



8 


He found me! 

The swamp hermit found me! And now he’s got me! 

Those are the thoughts that burst into my mind. 

I spun around—and uttered a startled cry when I saw that it wasn’t the 
swamp hermit. It was a boy. 

“Hi,” he said. “I thought you saw me. I didn’t mean to scare you.” He 
had a funny voice, gravelly and hoarse. 

“Oh. Uh... that’s okay,” I stammered. 

“I saw you in your yard,” he said. “I live over there.” He pointed to the 
house two doors down. “You just moved in?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. I’m Grady Tucker.” I slapped the tennis ball into my 
hand. “What’s your name?” 

“Will. Will Blake,” he said in his hoarse voice. He was about my 
height, but he was heavier, bigger somehow. His shoulders were broader. 
His neck was thicker. He reminded me of a football lineman. 

He had dark brown hair, cut very short. It stood straight up on top, like 
a flattop, and was swept back on the sides. He wore a blue-and-white- 
striped T-shirt and denim cutoffs. 

“How old are you?” he asked. 

“Twelve,” I answered. 

“Me, too,” he told me, glancing over my shoulder at the deer. “I 
thought maybe you were eleven. I mean, you look kind of young.” 

I was insulted by that remark, but I decided to ignore it. “How long 
have you lived here?” I asked, tossing the tennis ball from hand to hand. 

“A few months,” Will said. 

“Are there any other kids our age?” I asked, glancing down the row of 
six houses. 

“Yeah. One,” Will replied. “But she’s a girl. And she’s kind of weird.” 

In the distance, the sun was lowering itself behind the swamp trees. 
The sky was a dark scarlet. The air suddenly became cooler. Gazing high in 
the sky, I could see a pale moon, nearly full. 

Will headed over to the deer pen, and I followed him. He walked 



heavily, his big shoulders bobbing with each step. He poked his hand 
through the wire mesh and let a deer lick his palm. 

“Your father works for the Forest Service, too?” he asked, his eyes 
studying the deer. 

“No,” I told him. “My mom and dad are both scientists. They’re doing 
studies with these deer.” 

“Weird-looking deer,” Will said. He pulled his wet hand from the pen 
and held it up. “Yuck. Deer slime.” 

I laughed. “They’re called swamp deer,” I told him. I tossed him the 
tennis ball. We backed away from the deer pen and started to throw the ball 
back and forth. 

“Have you been in the swamp?” he asked. 

I missed the ball and had to chase it across the grass. “Yeah. This 
afternoon,” I told him. “My sister and I, we got lost.” 

He snickered. 

“Do you know why it’s called Fever Swamp?” I asked, tossing him a 
high one. 

It was getting pretty dark, harder to see. But he caught the ball one- 
handed. “Yeah. My dad told me the story,” Will said. “I think it was a 
hundred years ago. Maybe longer. Everyone in town came down with a 
strange fever.” 

“Everyone?” I asked. 

He nodded. “Everyone who had been in the swamp.” He held on to the 
ball and moved closer. “My dad said the fever lasted for weeks, sometimes 
even months. And lots of people died from it.” 

“That’s horrible,” I murmured, glancing across the back yard to the 
darkening trees at the swamp edge. 

“And those who didn’t die from the fever began acting very strange,” 
Will continued. He had small, round eyes. And as he told his story, his eyes 
gleamed. “They started talking crazy, not making any sense, just saying 
nonsense words. And they couldn’t walk very well. They’d fall down a lot 
or walk around in circles.” 

“Weird,” I said, my eyes still trained on the swamp. The sky darkened 
from scarlet to a deep purple. The nearly full moon seemed to glow 
brighter. 

“Ever since that time, they called it Fever Swamp,” Will said, finishing 



his story. He flipped the tennis ball to me. “I’d better get home.” 

“Did you ever see the swamp hermit?” I asked. 

He shook his head. “No. I heard about him, but I’ve never seen him.” 

“I did,” I told him. “My sister and I saw him this afternoon. We found 
his hut.” 

“That’s cool!” Will exclaimed. “Did you talk to him or anything?” 

“No way,” I replied. “He chased us.” 

“He did?” Will’s expression turned thoughtful. “Why?” 

“I don’t know. We were pretty scared,” I admitted. 

“I’ve got to go,” Will said. He started jogging toward his house. “Hey, 
maybe you and I can go exploring in the swamp together,” he called back. 

“Yeah. Great!” I replied. 

I felt a little cheered up. I’d made a new friend. Maybe it won’t be so 
bad living here, I thought. 

I watched Will head around the side of his house two doors down. His 
house looked almost identical to ours, except there was no deer pen in back, 
of course. 

I saw a swing set with a small slide and seesaw in his back yard. I 
wondered if he had a little brother or sister. 

I thought about Emily as I headed to the house. I knew she’d be 
jealous that I’d made a friend. Poor Emily was really sad without that goon 
Martin hanging around her. 

I never liked Martin. He always called me “Kiddo”. 

I watched one of the deer lower itself to the ground, folding its legs 
gracefully. Another deer did the same. They were settling in for the night. 

I made my way inside and joined my family in the living room. They 
were watching a show about sharks on the Discovery Channel. My parents 
love the Discovery Channel. Big surprise, huh? 

I watched for a short while. Then I began to realize I wasn’t feeling 
very well. I had a headache, a sharp throbbing at my temples. And I had 
chills. 

I told Mom. She got up and walked over to my chair. “You look a little 
flushed,” she said, studying me with concern. She placed a cool hand on my 
forehead and left it there for a few seconds. 

“Grady, I think you have a little fever,” she said. 



9 


A few nights later, I heard the strange, frightening howls for the first time. 

My fever had gone up to 101 degrees and stayed there for a day. Then 
it went away. Then it came back. 

“It’s the swamp fever!” I told my parents earlier that night. “Pretty 
soon I’m going to start acting crazy.” 

“You already act crazy,” Mom teased. She handed me a glass of 
orange juice. “Drink. Keep drinking.” 

“Drinking won’t help swamp fever,” I insisted glumly, taking the glass 
anyway. “There’s no cure for it.” 

Mom tsk-tsked. Dad continued to read his science magazine. 

I had strange dreams that night, disturbing dreams. I was back in 
Vermont, running through the snow. Something was chasing me. I thought 
maybe it was the swamp hermit. I kept running and running. I was very 
cold. I was shivering in the dream. 

I turned back to see who was chasing me. There wasn’t anyone there. 
And suddenly, I was in the swamp. I was sinking in a peat bog. It gurgled 
all around me, green and thick, making these sick sucking sounds. 

It was sucking me down. Down... 

The howls woke me up. 

I sat straight up in my bed and stared out the window at the nearly full 
moon. It floated right beyond the window, silvery and bright against the 
blue-black sky. 

Another long howl rose on the night air. 

I realized I was shaking all over. I was sweating. My pajama shirt 
stuck to my back. 

Gripping the covers with both hands, I listened hard. 

Another howl. The cry of an animal. 

From the swamp? 

The cries sounded so close. Right outside the window. Long, angry 
howls. 

I shoved down the covers and lowered my feet to the floor. I was still 
trembling, and my head throbbed as I stood up. I guessed I still had a fever. 



Another long howl. 

I made my way to the hall on shaky legs. I had to find out if my 
parents had heard the howls, too. 

Walking through the darkness, I bumped into a low table in the hall. I 
still wasn’t used to this new house. 

My feet were cold as ice, but my head felt burning hot, as if it were on 
fire. Rubbing the knee I had banged, I waited for my eyes to adjust to the 
darkness. Then I continued down the hall. 

My parents’ room was just past the kitchen in the back of the house. I 
was halfway across the kitchen when I stopped short. 

What was that sound? 

A scratching sound. 

My breath caught in my throat. I froze, my arms stiff at my sides. 

I listened. 

There it was again. 

Over the pounding of my heart, I heard it. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

Someone—or something —scratching at the kitchen door. 

Then—another howl. So close. So terrifyingly close. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

What could it be? Some kind of animal? Just outside the house? 

Some kind of swamp animal howling and scratching at the door? 

I realized I’d been holding my breath a long while. I let it out in a 
whoosh, then sucked in another breath. 

I listened hard, straining to hear over the pounding of my heart. 

The refrigerator clicked on. The loud click nearly made me jump out 
of my skin. I grabbed the countertop. My hands were as cold as my feet, 
cold and clammy. 

I listened. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

I took a step toward the kitchen door. 

One step, then I stopped. 

A shudder of fear ran down my back. 

I realized I wasn’t alone. 

Someone was there, breathing beside me in the dark kitchen. 



10 


I gasped. I was gripping the countertop so hard, my hand ached. 

“Wh-who’s there?” I whispered. 

The kitchen light flashed on. 

“Emily!” I practically shouted her name, in surprise and relief. “Emily 

“Did you hear the howls?” she asked, speaking just above a whisper. 
Her blue eyes burned into mine. 

“Yes. They woke me up,” I said. “They sound so angry.” 

“Like a cry of attack,” Emily whispered. “Why do you look so weird, 
Grady?” 

“Huh?” Her question caught me off guard. 

“Your face is all red,” she said. “And look at you—you’re all shaky.” 

“I think my fever is back,” I told her. 

“Swamp fever,” she murmured, examining me with her eyes. “Maybe 
it’s the swamp fever you were telling me about.” 

I turned to the kitchen door. “Did you hear the scratching sounds?” I 
asked. “Something was scratching on the back door.” 

“Yes,” she whispered. She stared at the door. 

We both listened. 

Silence. 

“Do you think one of the deer escaped?” she asked, taking a few steps 
toward the door, her arms crossed in front of her pink-and-white robe. 

“Do you think a deer would scratch at the door?” I asked. 

It was such a silly question, we both burst out laughing. 

“Maybe it wanted a glass of water!” Emily exclaimed, and we both 
laughed some more. Giddy laughter. Nervous laughter. 

We both cut our laughter short at the same time, and listened. 

Another howl rose up outside like a police siren. 

I saw Emily’s eyes narrow in fear. “It’s a wolf!” she cried in a hushed 
whisper. She raised a hand to her mouth. “Only a wolf makes a sound like 
that, Grady.” 



“Emily, come on—” I started to protest. 

“No. I’m right,” she insisted. “It’s a wolf howl.” 

“Em, stop,” I said, sinking onto a kitchen stool. “There are no wolves 
in the Florida swamps. You can look in the guidebooks. Or better yet, ask 
Mom and Dad. Wolves don’t live in swamps.” 

She started to argue, but a scratching at the door made her stop. 

Scratch scratch scratch. 

We both heard it. We both reacted with sharp gasps. 

“What is that?” I whispered. And then, reading her expression, I 
quickly added, “Don’t say it’s a wolf.” 

“I—I don’t know,” she replied, both hands raised to her face. I 
recognized her look of panic. “Let’s get Mom and Dad.” 

I grabbed the door handle. “Let’s just take a look,” I said. 

I don’t know where my sudden courage came from. Maybe it was the 
fever. But, suddenly, I just wanted to solve the mystery. 

Who or what was scratching at the door? 

There was one good way to find out—open the door and look outside. 

“No, Grady—wait!” Emily pleaded. 

But I waved away her protests. 

Then I turned the doorknob and pulled open the kitchen door. 



11 


A gust of hot, wet air rushed in through the open door. The chirp of cicadas 
greeted my ears. 

Holding on to the door, I peered into the darkness of the back yard. 

Nothing. 

The nearly full moon, yellow as a lemon, floated high in the sky. Thin 
wisps of black clouds drifted over it. 

The cicadas stopped suddenly, and all was quiet. 

Too quiet. 

I squinted into the distance, toward the blackness of the swamp. 

Nothing moved. Nothing made a sound. 

I waited for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. The moonlight sent a 
pale glow over the grass. In the far distance, I could see the black outline of 
slanting trees where the swamp began. 

Who or what had scratched at the door? Were they hiding in the 
darkness now? 

Watching me? 

Waiting for me to close the door so they could begin their frightening 
howls again? 

“Grady—close the door.” 

I could hear my sister’s voice behind me. She sounded so frightened. 

“Grady—do you see something? Do you?” 

“No,” I told her. “Just the moon.” 

I ventured out onto the back stoop. The air was hot and steamy, like 
the air in the bathroom after you’ve taken a hot shower. 

“Grady—come back. Close the door.” Emily’s voice was shrill and 
trembly. 

I gazed toward the deer pen. I could see their shadowy forms, still and 
silent. The hot wind rustled the grass. The cicadas began chirping again. 

“Is anybody out here?” I called. I immediately felt foolish. 

There was no one out here. 

“Grady—shut the door. Now.” 



I felt Emily’s hand on my pajama sleeve. She tugged me back into the 
kitchen. I closed the door and locked it. 

My face felt wet from the damp night air. I had chills. My knees were 
shaking. 

“You look kind of sick,” Emily said. She glanced over my shoulder to 
the door. “Did you see anything?” 

“No,” I told her. “Nothing. It’s so dark in back, even with a full 
moon.” 

“What’s going on in here?” A stern voice interrupted us. Dad lumbered 
into the kitchen, adjusting the collar of the long nightshirt he always wore. 
“It’s past midnight.” He glanced from Emily to me, then back to Emily, 
looking for a clue. 

“We heard noises,” Emily said. “Howls outside.” 

“And then something was scratching on the door,” I added, trying to 
keep my knees from shaking. 

“Fever dreams,” Dad said to me. “Look at you. You’re red as a tomato. 
And you’re shaking. Let’s take your temperature. You must be burning up.” 
He started toward the bathroom to get the thermometer. 

“It wasn’t a dream,” Emily called after him. “I heard the noises, too.” 

Dad stopped in the doorway. “Did you check the deer?” 

“Yeah. They’re okay,” I said. 

“Then maybe it was just the wind. Or some creatures in the swamp. 
It’s hard to sleep in a new house. The sounds are all so new, so unfamiliar. 
But you’ll both get used to them after a while.” 

I’ll never get used to those horrible howls, I thought stubbornly. But I 
headed back to my room. 

Dad took my temperature. It was just slightly above normal. “You 
should be fine by tomorrow,” he said, smoothing my blanket over me. “No 
more wandering around tonight, okay?” 

I murmured a reply and almost instantly drifted into a restless sleep. 

Again I had strange, troubling dreams. I dreamed I was walking in the 
swamp. I heard the howls. I could see the full moon between the slender 
tree trunks of the swamp. 

I started to mn. And then suddenly I was up to my waist in a thick, 
green bog. And the howls continued, one after the other, echoing through 
the trees as I sank into the murky bog. 



When I awoke the next morning, the dream lingered in my mind. I 
wondered if the howls were real, or just part of the dream. 

Climbing out of bed, I realized I felt fine. Yellow morning sunlight 
poured in through the window. I could see a clear blue sky. The beautiful 
morning made me forget my nightmares. 

I wondered if Will was around this morning. Maybe he and I could go 
exploring in the swamp. 

I got dressed quickly, pulling on pale blue jeans and a black-and-silver 
Raiders T-shirt. (I’m not a Raiders fan. I just like their colors.) 

I gulped down a bowl of Frosted Flakes, allowed my mom to feel my 
head to make sure my fever was gone, and hurried to the back door. 

“Whoa. Hold on,” Mom called, setting down her coffee cup. “Where 
are you going so early?” 

“I want to see if Will is home,” I said. “Maybe we’ll hang out or 
something.” 

“Okay. Just don’t overdo it,” she warned. “Promise?” 

“Yeah. Promise,” I replied. 

I pulled open the kitchen door, stepped out into blinding sunlight—and 
screamed as an enormous, dark monster leapt onto my chest and heaved me 
to the ground. 



12 


“It—it’s got me!” I screamed as it pushed me to the ground and jumped on 
my chest. 

“Help! It—it’s licking my faceV 

I was so startled, it took me a long time to realize my attacker was a 

dog. 

By the time Mom and Dad came to my rescue and started to pull the 
big creature off my chest, I was laughing. “Hey—that tickles! Stop!” 

I wiped the dog spit off my face with my hands and scrambled to my 

feet. 

“Where’d you come from?” Mom asked the dog. She and Dad were 
holding on to the enormous beast. 

They both let go, and it stood wagging its tail excitedly, panting, its big 
red tongue hanging down practically to the ground. 

“He’s enormous!” Dad exclaimed. “He must be part shepherd.” 

I was still wiping the sticky saliva off my cheeks. 

“He scared me to death,” I confessed. “Didn’t you, fella?” I reached 
down and stroked the dark gray fur on the top of his head. His long tail 
started wagging faster. 

“He likes you,” Mom said. 

“He practically killed me!” I exclaimed. “Look at him. He must weigh 
more than a hundred pounds!” 

“Were you the one scratching at our door last night?” Emily appeared 
in the doorway, still in the long T-shirt she used as a nightshirt. “I think this 
clears up the mystery,” she said to me, yawning sleepily and pulling her 
blonde hair behind her shoulders with both hands. 

“I guess,” I muttered. I got down on my knees beside the big dog and 
stroked his back. He turned his head and licked my cheek again. “Yuck! 
Quit that!” I told him. 

“I wonder who he belongs to?” Mom said, staring at the dog 
thoughtfully. “Grady, check his collar. There’s probably an ID tag.” 

I reached up to the dog’s broad neck and felt around in his fur for a 
collar. “Nothing there,” I reported. 



“Maybe he’s a stray,” Emily said from inside the kitchen. “Maybe 
that’s why he was scratching the door last night.” 

“Yeah,” I said quickly. “He needs a place to live.” 

“Whoa,” Mom said, shaking her head. “I don’t think we need a dog 
right now, Grady. We just moved in, and—” 

“But I need a pet!” I insisted. “It’s so lonely here. A dog would be 
great, Mom. He could keep me company.” 

“You have the deer for pets,” Dad said, frowning. He turned to the deer 
pen. The six deer were all standing alertly at attention, staring warily at the 
dog. 

“You can’t walk a deer!” I protested. “Besides, you’re going to set the 
deer free, right?” 

“The dog probably belongs to someone,” Mom said. “You can’t just 
claim any dog that wanders by. Besides, he’s so big, Grady. He’s too big to 

“Aw, let him keep it,” Emily called from the house. 

I stared at her in shock. I couldn’t remember the last time Emily and I 
had been on the same side of a family argument. 

The discussion continued for several minutes more. Everyone agreed 
that he seemed like a sweet-tempered, gentle dog despite his huge size. And 
he certainly was affectionate. I couldn’t make him stop licking me. 

Glancing up, I saw Will come out of his house and head across the 
back lawns toward us. He was wearing a sleeveless blue T-shirt and blue 
Lycra bicycle shorts. “Hi! Look what we found!” I called. 

I introduced Will to my mom and dad. Emily had disappeared back to 
her room to get dressed. 

“Have you seen this dog before?” Dad asked Will. “Does he belong to 
someone in the neighborhood?” 

Will shook his head. “Nope. Never seen him.” He cautiously petted the 
dog’s head. 

“Where’d you come from, fella?” I asked, staring into the creature’s 
eyes. They were blue. Sky-blue. 

“He looks more like a wolf than a dog,” Will said. 

“Yeah. He really does,” I agreed. “Was that you howling like a wolf all 
last night?” I asked the dog. He tried to lick my nose, but I pulled my face 
back in time. 



I glanced up at Will. “Did you hear those howls last night? They were 
really weird.” 

“No. I didn’t hear anything,” Will replied. “I’m a very sound sleeper. 
My dad comes into my room and shouts through a megaphone to wake me 
up in the morning. Really!” 

We all laughed. 

“He really does look like a wolf,” Mom commented, staring at the 
dog’s blue eyes. 

“Wolves are skinnier,” Dad remarked. “Their snouts are narrower. He 
could be part wolf, I suppose. But it’s not very likely in this geographical 
area.” 

“Let’s call him Wolf,” I suggested enthusiastically. “It’s the perfect 
name for him.” I climbed to my feet. “Hi, Wolf,” I called to the dog. “Wolf! 
Hi, Wolf!” 

His ears perked straight up. 

“See? He likes the name!” I exclaimed. “Wolf! Wolf!” 

He barked at me, a single yip. 

“Can I keep him?” I asked. 

Mom and Dad exchanged long glances. “We’ll see,” Mom said. 

That afternoon, Will and I headed to the swamp to do some exploring. My 
nightmares about the swamp lingered in my mind. But I did my best to 
force them away. 

It was a blazing hot day. The sun burned down in a clear, cloudless 
sky. As we crossed my back yard, I hoped it would be cooler in the leafy 
shade of the swamp. 

I glanced back at Wolf. He was napping in the hot sunlight on his side, 
his four legs stretched straight out in front of him. 

We had fed him before lunch, some leftover roast beef scraps from our 
dinner the night before. He gobbled it up hungrily. Then, after slurping up 
an entire bowl of water, he dropped down in the grass in front of the back 
stoop to take his nap. 

Will and I followed the dirt path into the slanting trees. Black-and- 
orange monarch butterflies, four or five of them, fluttered over a bank of 
tall wildflowers. 

“Hey!” I cried out as my foot sank into a marshy spot in the dirt. When 



I pulled my sneaker out, it was covered with wet sand. 

“Have you seen the bog?” Will asked. “It’s kind of neat.” 

“Yeah. Let’s go there,” I said enthusiastically. “We can throw sticks in 
and stuff, and watch them sink.” 

“Do you think any people ever got sunk in the bog?” Will asked 
thoughtfully. He brushed a mosquito off his broad forehead, then scratched 
his short, dark brown hair. 

“Maybe,” I replied, following him as he turned off the path and headed 
through a wide patch of tall reeds. “Do you think it would really suck you 
down into it, like quicksand?” 

“My dad says there’s no such thing as quicksand,” Will said. 

“I bet there is,” I told him. “I bet people have fallen into the bog 
accidentally and gotten sucked down. If we brought a fishing rod, we could 
cast a line in and pull up their bones.” 

“Gross,” he said. 

We were walking over a carpet of dead brown leaves. Our sneakers 
crunched noisily as we made our way under tangled palm trees toward the 
bog. 

Suddenly, Will stopped. “Ssshhh. ” He raised a finger to his lips. 

I heard it, too. 

Crunching behind us. 

Footsteps. 

We both froze in place, listening hard. The footsteps drew closer. 

Will’s dark eyes narrowed in fear. “Someone’s following us,” he 
murmured. “It’s the swamp hermit!” 



13 


“Quick—hide!” I cried. 

Will dived behind a thick clump of tall weeds. I tried to follow him, 
but there wasn’t room for both of us. 

Crawling on my hands and knees, I searched frantically for something 
to hide behind. 

The crackling of dead leaves became louder. The footsteps hurried 
closer. 

I scrambled toward a nest of brambles. No. They wouldn’t hide me. 

A clump of ferns across from me was too low. 

The footsteps crackled closer. 

Closer. 

“Hide! Hide!” Will urged. 

But I was trapped out in the open. Caught. 

I struggled to my feet just as our pursuer came into view. 

“Wolf!” I cried. 

The big dog’s tail began wagging furiously as soon as he saw me. He 
uttered a joyful bark—and jumped. 

“No!” I managed to cry. 

His front paws landed hard on my chest. I stumbled backwards into the 
tall weeds and fell onto Will. 

“Hey!” He cried out and scrambled to his feet. 

Wolf barked happily and practically smothered me, trying to lick my 

face. 

“Wolf—down! Down!” I shouted. I stood up and started brushing dead 
leaves off my T-shirt. “Wolf, you’ve got to stop doing that, boy,” I told him. 
“You’re not a little puppy, you know?” 

“How did he find us?” Will asked, pulling a burr off the seat of his 
blue Lycra shorts. 

“Good nose, I guess,” I replied, staring down at the happily panting 
dog. “Maybe he’s part hunting dog or something.” 

“Let’s get to the bog,” Will said impatiently. He began leading the 



way, but Wolf pushed past him, nearly bumping him over, and continued 
trotting toward the bog, his powerful legs taking long, steady strides. 

“Wolf acts as if he knows where we’re going,” I said, a little surprised. 

“Maybe he’s been here before,” Will replied. “Maybe he’s a swamp 
dog.” 

“Maybe,” I replied thoughtfully, staring down at Wolf. Where do you 
come from, dog? I wondered. He certainly did seem at home in the swamp. 

In a short while, we came to the edge of the peat bog. I wiped the 
sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand and stared across the oval¬ 
shaped pond. 

Shafts of sunlight made the green surface sparkle. Thousands of tiny 
white insects fluttered just above it, catching the light, glistening like little 
diamonds. 

Will picked up a small tree branch. He cracked it in half between his 
hands. Then he heaved one of the halves high into the air. 

It hit the surface of the bog with more of a thunk than a splash. And 
then it just lay there. It didn’t sink. 

“Weird,” I said. “Let’s try something heavier.” 

I started to search for something, but a low growl caught my attention. 
I turned toward the sound. To my surprise, it was coming from Wolf. 

The dog had lowered its big head. Its entire body stood tensed, as if in 
attack position. Its dark lips were pulled back, revealing two sharp rows of 
teeth. It uttered a low growl, then another. 

“I think he senses danger,” Will said softly. 



14 


Wolf uttered another menacing growl, baring his jagged teeth. The fur on 
his back stood up stiffly. His legs tensed as if preparing to attack. 

The sound of crackling twigs made me raise my eyes. I saw a gray 
figure darting behind tall weeds on the other side of the bog. 

“Who—who’s that?” Will whispered. 

I stared straight ahead, unable to speak. 

“Is that—” Will started. 

“Yes,” I managed to choke out. “It’s him. The swamp hermit.” I 
dropped quickly to my knees, hoping to keep out of view. 

But had he already seen us? 

Had he been there at the other side of the bog all along? 

Will must have been sharing my thoughts. “Has that weirdo been 
spying on us?” he demanded, huddling beside me. 

Wolf uttered a quiet growl, still frozen in place, ready to attack. 

Keeping low, I scooted closer to the dog. For protection, I guess. 

I watched the strange man as he made his way through the weeds. His 
long, gray-white hair was wild, standing straight out around his face. He 
kept glancing behind him as he walked, as if making sure he wasn’t being 
followed. 

He carried a brown sack over one shoulder. 

He turned his gaze in our direction. I dropped down lower, trying to 
hide behind Wolf, my heart pounding. 

Wolf hadn’t moved, but he was silent now. His ears were still pulled 
back, his lips still open in a soundless snarl. 

What were those dark stains on the front of the swamp hermit’s grimy 
shirt? 

Bloodstains? 

A shiver of fear ran down my back. 

Wolf stared straight ahead without blinking, without moving a muscle. 

The swamp hermit disappeared behind the tall weeds. We couldn’t see 
him, but we could still hear his footsteps crunching over dead leaves and 
fallen twigs. 



I glanced over at Wolf. The big dog shook himself, as if shaking the 
swamp hermit from his mind. His tail wagged slowly. His body relaxed. 

He uttered soft whimpers, as if telling me how scared he had been. 

“It’s okay, boy,” I said quietly, and rubbed the soft fur on top of the 
dog’s head. He stopped whimpering and licked at my wrist. 

“That guy is creepy!” Will exclaimed, climbing slowly to his feet. 

“He even scared the dog,” I said, petting Wolf some more. “What do 
you think he had in the sack?” 

“Probably someone’s head!” Will said, his dark eyes wide with horror. 

I laughed. But I stopped when I saw that Will wasn’t joking. 
“Everyone says he’s harmless,” I said. 

“He had blood all over the front of his shirt,” Will said with a shudder. 
He scratched his short, dark hair nervously. 

The sunlight faded quickly as clouds rolled over the sun. Long 
shadows crept over the bog. The stick Will had thrown had disappeared, 
sucked into the thick, murky water. 

“Let’s get home,” I suggested. 

“Yeah. Okay,” Will agreed quickly. 

I called to Wolf, who was exploring in the tall weeds. Then we turned 
and started to make our way back along the twisting dirt path. 

A soft breeze fluttered the trees, making the palm leaves scrape and 
clatter. Tall ferns shivered in the wind. The shadows grew deeper and 
darker. 

I could hear Wolf behind us. I could hear his body brushing through 
low shrubs and weeds. 

We were nearly to where the trees ended and the flat grass leading to 
our back yards began. We were nearly out of the swamp when Will stopped 
suddenly. 

I saw his mouth drop open in horror. 

I turned to follow his gaze. 

Then I uttered a shocked cry and covered my eyes to shut out the 
gmesome sight. 



15 


When I opened my eyes, the hideous pile of feathers and blood-covered 
flesh was still at my feet. 

“Wh-what is it?” Will stammered. 

It took me a long while to realize we were staring at a bird. A large 
heron. 

It was hard to recognize because it had been torn apart. 

Long, white feathers were scattered over the soft ground. The poor 
bird’s chest had been torn wide open. 

“The swamp hermit!” Will cried. 

“Huh?” I cried. I turned away from the hideous sight and tried to force 
the image from my mind. 

“That’s why he had blood all over his shirt!” Will declared. 

“But why would he rip a bird apart?” I asked weakly. 

“Because... because he’s a monster !” Will exclaimed. 

“He’s just a weird old guy who lives alone in the swamp,” I said. “He 
didn’t do this, Will. Some kind of animal did it. Look!” I pointed to the 
ground. 

There were paw prints in the soft ground. All around the dead bird. 

“They look like dog’s paws,” I said, thinking out loud. 

“Dogs don’t rip apart birds,” Will replied quietly. 

At that moment, Wolf came bounding up to us through the weeds. He 
came to a stop in front of the dead bird and started to sniff it. 

“Get away from there, Wolf,” I ordered. “Come on. Get away.” I 
tugged him back, pulling him with both hands around his thick neck. 

“Let’s get home,” Will said. “Let’s get away from this thing. I’m going 
to have bad dreams. I really will.” 

I pulled Wolf with both hands. We stepped carefully around the dead 
heron and then hurried toward the swamp edge. Neither of us said a word. I 
guess we were both still picturing what we had seen. 

As we reached the flat grass behind our houses, I said good-bye to 
Will. I watched him hurry to his house. Wolf scampered after him for part 
of the way. Then he turned and hurried back to me. 



The late afternoon sun burned its way through the clouds. I shielded 
my eyes from the sudden brightness, and saw my dad working in the deer 
pen behind the house. 

“Hey, Dad—” I ran toward him over the grass. 

He glanced up when I called to him. He was wearing denim cutoffs 
and a sleeveless yellow T-shirt. He had an Orlando Magic cap pulled down 
over his forehead. “What’s up, Grady?” 

“Will and I—we saw a dead heron,” I told him breathlessly. 

“Where? In the swamp?” he asked casually. He pulled off the cap, 
wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, and replaced the cap. 

“Dad, it—it was torn apart!” I cried. 

He didn’t react. “That’s part of life in the wild,” he said, pulling up one 
of the deer’s hooves to examine the bottom. “You know that, Grady. It can 
get pretty violent out there. We’ve talked about survival of the fittest and 
stuff like that.” 

“No, Dad. This is different,” I insisted. “The heron—it was ripped in 
two. I mean, like someone took it, and—” 

“Another bird, maybe,” Dad said, concentrating on the deer hoof. “A 
larger bird of prey. It could have been—” 

“We saw the swamp hermit,” I interrupted. “He had blood all over his 
shirt. Then we saw paw prints in the ground. All around the dead bird.” 

“Grady, calm down,” Dad said, setting down the deer’s leg. “If you go 
exploring in the swamp, you’re going to see a lot of frightening-looking 
things. But don’t let your imagination run away with you.” 

“Will said it was done by a monster!” I exclaimed. 

Dad frowned and scratched his head through the cap. “I see your new 
friend has a good imagination, too,” he said quietly. 

That night, I was glad my parents agreed to let Wolf sleep in my room. I felt 
a lot safer with the big dog curled up on the rug beside my bed. 

I hadn’t been able to shake the ugly picture of the dead heron from my 
mind. I watched some TV until dinnertime. Then after dinner, I played a 
long chess game with Emily. 

But no matter what I did, I kept seeing the white feathers scattered 
over the ground, the torn-apart bird lying crumpled on the path. 

So now I felt a little comforted with Wolf sleeping in the room. “You’ll 



protect me, won’t you, boy?” I whispered from my bed. 

He uttered a low snort. Light from the full moon spilled over him 
through the window. I saw that he was sleeping with his head resting on his 
two front paws. 

Then I drifted into a dreamless sleep. 

I don’t know how long I slept. 

I was awakened some time later by a horrifying crash. 

I sat straight up with a startled gasp. 

The crash had come from the living room, I realized. 

Someone was breaking in! 



16 


Was it a burglar? 

I climbed out of bed, my heart pounding, and crept to the door. 

Another crash. A loud thump. 

Footsteps. 

“Who—who is it?” I cried. My voice came out in a choked whisper. 

Keeping against the wall, I made my way slowly toward the living 
room. “Who’s there?” I shouted. 

Mom and Dad and Emily met me in the dark hallway. Even in the 
darkness I could see the fear and confusion on their faces. 

I was the first to the living room. Pale yellow light from the full moon 
washed across the room. “Hey!” I called out. 

Wolf leaped against the big front window. His shoulders made a loud 
thud against the glass. 

“Wolf—stop!” I cried. 

In the pale light, I saw what had caused the loud crash. Wolf had 
knocked over the table and a lamp that had stood in front of the window. 

“He—he’s trying to get outside,” I stammered. 

I felt Dad’s hand on the shoulder of my pajama shirt. “What a mess 
he’s made,” he murmured. 

“Wolf—stop!” I called again. 

The big dog turned, breathing hard. His eyes glowed red in the 
moonlight through the window. 

“Why is he so desperate to get out?” Emily demanded. 

“We can’t have him in the house if he does this every night,” Mom 
said, her voice hoarse from sleep. 

The big dog lowered his head and let out an excited growl. His tail 
stood straight up behind him. 

“Open the front door. Let him out,” Mom said. “Before he wrecks the 
whole house.” 

Dad hurried across the room and pulled open the door. Wolf didn’t 
hesitate for a second. He bounded to the door and burst out. 



I ran to the window to watch him. But the big dog disappeared around 
the side of the house, running toward the back yard. 

“He’s heading to the swamp,” I guessed. 

“He tried to break right through the window,” Mom said. 

Emily clicked on a lamp. “He’s so strong, he probably could have 
broken the window,” she said quietly. 

Dad closed the front door. He yawned. Then he turned his gaze on me. 
“You know what this means, don’t you, Grady?” 

I was still staring out at the full moon. “No. What?” 

“Wolf will have to stay outdoors from now on,” Dad said. He stooped 
and began picking up pieces of the broken lamp. 

“But, Dad—” I started to protest. 

“He’s too big and too restless to stay in the house,” Dad continued. He 
handed the lamp pieces to Emily. Then he pulled the table rightside up and 
returned it to its place in front of the window. 

“Wolf didn’t mean to break the lamp,” I argued weakly. 

“He’ll break everything we have,” Mom said quietly. 

“He’s just too big,” Dad added. “He’ll have to stay outside, Grady.” 

“Why did he want out so desperately?” Emily demanded. 

“He’s probably used to being outside,” Dad told her. “He’ll be happier 
out there,” he said, turning to me. 

“Yeah. Maybe,” I replied glumly. I liked having Wolf sleep beside me 
in my bedroom. But I knew there was no way I could convince my parents 
to give the dog a second chance. Their minds were made up. 

And at least they were letting me keep Wolf. 

I pulled the vacuum cleaner out of the closet and plugged it in. Dad 
took the nozzle and began vacuuming up the tiny pieces of glass from the 
carpet. 

That crazy dog, I thought, shaking my head unhappily. What is his 
problem, anyway? 

When Dad finished, I carried the vacuum cleaner back to the closet. 

“Now maybe we can all sleep in peace,” Mom said, yawning. 

She was wrong. 



17 


I heard the frightening howls again a short while later. 

At first I thought I was dreaming them. 

But when I opened my eyes and gazed around my dark bedroom, the 
howls continued. Still half asleep, I gripped the covers with both hands and 
pulled them up to my chin. 

The howls sounded so close, as if they were right outside my window. 
They didn’t seem like the cries of an animal. They were too angry, too 
deliberate. 

Too human. 

Stop trying to frighten yourself, I thought. It’s a wolf. It has to be some 
kind of swamp wolf. 

In the back of my mind, I knew it might be Wolf making those 
frightening sounds. But I kept pushing the thought away. 

Why would the dog howl like that? 

Dogs bark. They don’t howl unless they’re very sad or upset. 

I shut my eyes, wishing the frightening wails away. 

Suddenly, they stopped. Silence. 

Then I heard rapid thumps on the ground. Footsteps. 

Some kind of a struggle. 

I heard a short, terrifying cry. It cut off almost as soon as it began. 

It’s right in back of the house, I realized. 

Wide awake now, I jumped out of bed, dragging the covers with me. I 
stumbled to the bedroom window and grabbed the windowsill. 

The full moon had risen high in the night sky. The back yard stretched 
out silvery in the moonlight, the dewy grass shimmering in the bright light. 

Pressing my forehead against the windowpane, I peered out toward the 
dark swamp. I uttered a near-silent gasp when I saw the shadowy creature 
running toward the trees. 

A large creature, running on all fours. 

It was only a black outline fading into the darkness. But I could see 
how big it was, and I could see how fast it was running. 



And I heard its howls. Triumphant howls, I thought. 

Is it Wolf? I wondered. I peered out the window without moving, even 
though the darkness had swallowed the creature up. I could see only the 
outline of distant trees. 

But I could still hear the howls rising and falling on the heavy night 
air. 

Is it Wolf? 

It can’t be Wolf—can it? 

I lowered my gaze. My breath caught in my throat. I saw something. In 
the middle of the backyard. A few feet from the deer pen. 

At first I thought it was a pile of rags. 

My hands trembled as I pulled open my window. 

I had to get a better look. I had to see what that was in the back yard. 

I pulled up my pajama bottoms. Then, gripping the windowsill, I 
lowered myself out the window onto the grass. 

The wet grass felt cold under my bare feet. I turned to the deer pen. 
The six swamp deer were standing tensely, huddled together against the 
house. Their dark eyes followed me as I began to creep across the grass. 

What is that thing? I wondered, staring into the silvery light. 

Is it just a pile of old rags? 

No. 

What is it? 



18 


My bare feet felt cold and wet as I made my way slowly across the dew- 
covered grass. The night air was heavy and still, still as death. 

When I came close enough to see what was lying in a heap on the 
grass, I uttered a faint cry and started to gag. 

I pressed a hand against my mouth and swallowed hard. 

I realized I was staring down at a rabbit. Its small, black eyes were 
frozen open in terror. One of its ears had been pulled off. 

The rabbit had been ripped open, nearly torn in half. 

I forced myself to look away. 

My stomach still heaving, I hurried back over the wet grass to my open 
window and scrambled back in. 

As I struggled to pull the window shut, the howls rang out again, rising 
triumphantly from the nearby swamp. 

After breakfast the next morning, I led Dad out to the back yard to show 
him the murdered rabbit. It was a bright, hot day, and a red sun climbed a 
pale, clear sky. 

As soon as we stepped off the back stoop, Wolf appeared from around 
the side of his house. His tail began wagging furiously. He came running 
excitedly to greet me, as if he hadn’t seen me in years, leaping onto my 
chest, nearly knocking me over. 

“Down, Wolf! Down!” I cried, laughing as the dog stretched to lick my 

face. 

“Your dog is a killer,” a voice said behind me. I turned to see that 
Emily had followed us. She was wearing a red T-shirt over white tennis 
shorts. She had her arms crossed in front of her, and she was glaring 
disapprovingly at Wolf. “Look what he did to that poor bunny rabbit,” she 
said, shaking her head. 

“Whoa. Hold on,” I replied, petting Wolf’s gray fur. “Who said Wolf 
did this?” 

“Who else would have done it?” Emily demanded. “He’s a killer.” 

“Oh, yeah? Look how gentle he is,” I insisted. I put my wrist in Wolf’s 



mouth. He clamped down gently on it, being careful not to hurt me. 

“Wolf may be a bit of a hunter,” Dad said thoughtfully. He had been 
staring down at the rabbit, but now he turned his glance to the deer pen. 

Huddled together at one end of the pen, the deer were all staring warily 
at Wolf. They had their heads lowered cautiously as they followed the dog’s 
every move. 

“I’m glad they’re safe inside that pen,” Dad said softly. 

“Dad, you have to get rid of this dog!” Emily said shrilly. 

“No way!” I cried. I turned angrily to my sister. “You have no proof 
that Wolf did anything wrong!” I shouted. “No proof at all!” 

“You have no proof that he didn’t do it!” Emily replied nastily. 

“Of course he didn’t!” I cried, feeling myself lose control. “Didn’t you 
hear the howls last night? Didn’t you hear those frightening howls? It 
wasn’t a dog howling like that. Dogs don’t howl like that!” 

“Then what was it?” Emily demanded. 

“I heard them, too,” Dad said, stepping between us. “They sounded 
more like wolf howls. Or maybe a coyote.” 

“See?” I told Emily. 

“But I’d be very surprised to find a wolf or coyote in this area,” Dad 
continued, gazing out toward the swamp. 

Emily still had her arms crossed tightly over her chest. She gazed 
down at Wolf and shuddered. “He’s dangerous, Dad. You really have to get 
rid of him.” 

Dad walked over and patted Wolf’s head. He scratched Wolf under the 
chin. Wolf licked Dad’s hand. 

“Let’s just be careful around him,” Dad said. “He seems very gentle. 
But we don’t really know anything about him—do we? So let’s be very 
careful, okay?” 

“I’m going to be careful,” Emily replied, narrowing her eyes at Wolf. 
“I’m going to stay as far away from that monster as I can.” She turned and 
stormed back to the house. 

Dad made his way to the shed to get a shovel and box to carry away 
the dead rabbit in. 

I dropped to my knees and hugged Wolf’s broad neck. “You aren’t a 
monster, are you, boy?” I asked. “Emily is crazy, isn’t she? You’re not a 
monster. That wasn’t you I saw running toward the swamp last night, was 



it?” 


Wolf raised his deep blue eyes to mine. He stared hard at me. 
He seemed to be trying to tell me something. 

But I had no idea what it could be. 



19 


That night I didn’t hear the howls. 

I woke up in the middle of the night and stared out the window. Wolf 
was gone, probably exploring the swamp. In the morning, I knew he’d 
come running back to greet me as if I were a long lost friend. 

The next morning Will showed up just as I was giving Wolf his 
breakfast, a big bowl of crunchy, dry dog food. “Hey, what’s up?” Will 
asked, his usual greeting. 

“Nothing much,” I said. I rolled up the top of the big bag of dog food 
and dragged it back into the kitchen. Wolf stood over his bowl, his head 
lowered, chewing noisily away. 

I pushed open the screen door and returned to Will. He was wearing a 
dark blue muscle shirt and black Lycra bike shorts. He had a green-and- 
yellow Forest Service cap pulled down over his dark hair. 

“Want to go exploring?” he asked in his hoarse voice, watching Wolf 
hungrily gobble down his breakfast. “You know. In the swamp?” 

“Yeah. Sure,” I said. I called inside to tell my parents where I was 
going. Then I followed Will across the back lawn toward the swamp. 

Wolf came scampering after us. He’d run past us, then let us catch up. 
Then he’d run in crazy zigzags in front of us, behind us, romping happily 
under the hot morning sun. 

“Did you hear about Mr. Warner?” Will asked. He stopped to pick up a 
long blade of grass and put it between his teeth. 

“Who?” 

“Ed Warner,” Will replied. “I guess you haven’t met the Warners yet. 
They live in the very last house.” He turned and pointed behind us to the 
last white house at the end of the row of white houses. 

“What about him?” I asked, nearly tripping over Wolf, who had come 
rumbling past my feet. 

“He’s missing,” Will replied, chewing on the grass blade. “He didn’t 
come home last night.” 

“Huh? From where?” I asked, turning to stare at the Warners’ house. 
Heat waves shimmered up from the grass, making the house appear to bend 



and quiver. 

“From the swamp,” Will replied darkly. “Mrs. Warner called my mom 
this morning. She said Mr. Warner went hunting yesterday afternoon. He 
likes to hunt wild turkeys. He took me with him a couple times. He’s real 
good at chasing them down. When he kills one, he hangs its feet up on his 
den wall.” 

“He does?” I cried. It sounded pretty gross to me. 

“Yeah. You know. Like a trophy,” Will continued. “Anyway, he went 
hunting wild turkeys in the swamp yesterday afternoon, and he hasn’t come 
home.” 

“Weird,” I said, watching Wolf stop at the edge of the trees. “Maybe he 
got lost.” 

“No way,” Will insisted, shaking his head. “Not Mr. Warner. He’s lived 
here a long time. He was the first one to move here. Mr. Warner wouldn’t 
get lost.” 

“Then maybe the werewolf got him!” called a strange voice behind us. 



20 


Startled, we both spun around to see a girl about our age. She had rust- 
colored red hair tied in a ponytail on one side. She had catlike green eyes, 
and a short stub of a nose, and freckles all over her face. She was wearing 
faded red denim jeans and a T-shirt with a grinning green alligator on the 
front. 

“Cassie, what are you doing here?” Will demanded. 

“Following you,” she replied, making a face at him. She turned to me. 
“You’re the new kid, Grady, right? Will told me about you.” 

“Hi,” I said awkwardly. “He told me a girl lived in the neighborhood. 
But he didn’t tell me much about you.” 

“What’s to tell?” Will teased. 

“I’m Cassie O’Rourke,” she said. She shot up her hand and pulled the 
blade of grass from Will’s mouth. 

“Hey!” He playfully tried to slug her, but missed. 

“What did you say about a werewolf?” I asked. 

“Don’t start with that stuff again,” Will grumbled to Cassie. “It’s so 
stupid.” 

“You’re just afraid,” Cassie accused. 

“No, I’m not. It’s too stupid,” Will insisted. 

We stepped into the shade of the trees at the swamp edge. A funnel 
cloud of white gnats whirred crazily in a shaft of light between the trees. 

“There’s a werewolf in the swamp,” Cassie said, lowering her voice as 
we ducked past the gnats and moved deeper into the shade. 

“And I’m going to flap my wings and fly to Mars,” Will said 
sarcastically. 

“Shut up, Will,” Cassie snapped. “Grady doesn’t think it’s stupid—do 
you?” 

I shrugged. “I don’t know,” I said. “I don’t think I believe in 
werewolves.” 

Will laughed. “Cassie believes in the Easter Bunny, too,” he said. 

Cassie socked him hard in the chest. 

“Hey!” Will cried out angrily as he staggered back. “What’s your 



problem?” 

“Mosquito,” she said, pointing. “A big one. I got him.” 

Scowling, Will glanced down. “I don’t see any mosquito. Give me a 
break, Cassie.” 

We made our way along the winding path. It had rained the day before. 
The ground was marshier than usual. We kept slipping in the soft mud. 

“Do you hear the howling sounds at night?” I asked Cassie. 

“That’s the werewolf,” she replied softly. Her green cat-eyes burned 
into mine. “I’m not kidding around, Grady. I’m serious. Those howls aren’t 
human. Those howls come from a werewolf who has just killed.” 

Will snickered. “You’ve got a good imagination, Cassie. I guess you 
watch a lot of scary movies on TV, huh?” 

“Real life is scarier than the movies,” she said, lowering her voice to a 
whisper. 

“Ooh, stop. You’re making me shake all over!” Will exclaimed 
sarcastically. 

She didn’t reply. She was still staring at me as we walked. “You 
believe me, don’t you?” 

“I don’t know,” I said. 

The bog came into view. The air became heavier, wetter. The tall 
weeds on the other side stood straight up. The bog gurgled quietly. Two big 
flies danced over the dark green surface. 

“There’s no such thing as werewolves, Cassie,” Will muttered, 
searching for something to throw into the bog. He grinned at her. “Unless 
maybe you ’re one!” 

She rolled her eyes. “Very funny.” She made biting motions with her 
teeth as if she were going to bite him. 

I heard a rustling sound across the oval-shaped bog. The tall weeds 
suddenly parted, and Wolf appeared at the edge of the water. 

“What does the werewolf look like?” Will asked sarcastically. “Does it 
have red hair and freckles?” 

Cassie didn’t reply. 

I turned to see a look of terror freeze on her face. Her green eyes grew 
wide, and her freckles seemed to fade. “Th-there’s the werewolf !” she 
stammered in a choked whisper. She pointed. 

Feeling a chill of fear, I turned to see where she was pointing. 



To my horror, she was pointing right at Wolf! 



21 


“No!” I started to protest. 

But then I saw that I had misunderstood. Cassie wasn’t pointing at 
Wolf. She was pointing to the figure moving through the tall weeds behind 
the dog. 

The swamp hermit! 

I saw him walking quickly behind the weeds, his shoulders bent, his 
mangy head bobbing with each step. 

As he moved into a small break in the weeds, I could see why he was 
leaning forward. He carried something over one shoulder. A bag of some 
sort. 

Wolf started to growl. 

The hermit stopped walking. 

It wasn’t a bag slung over his shoulder, I saw. It was a turkey. A wild 
turkey. 

A chilling thought burst into my mind: Had he taken it from Mr. 
Warner? 

Was Cassie right about the swamp hermit? Was he a werewolf? Had he 
done something horrible to Mr. Warner and claimed the wild turkey as his 
prize? 

I tried to dismiss these horrible thoughts. They were crazy. Impossible. 

But Cassie looked so frightened, staring across the gurgling green bog 
at the wild-eyed hermit. And the howls at night, the howls had been so 
frightening, so human. 

And the dead animals I’d seen, torn so brutally apart, as if... as if by a 
werewolf! 

Wolf uttered another warning growl. He stared at the hermit, his tail 
standing stiffly behind him, his fur rising up on his back. 

The hermit moved quickly. I saw his dark eyes flash just before he 
disappeared behind the weeds. 

“It’s him!” Cassie cried, still pointing. “It’s the werewolf!” 

“Cassie —shut up!” Will warned. “He’ll hear you!” 

I swallowed hard, frozen in place by my fear. I saw the weeds tremble 



across the bog. I heard rustling sounds growing closer. 

“Run!” Will cried, his hoarse voice shrill and frightened. “Come on— 

run!” 

Too late. 

The swamp hermit burst out of the weeds right behind us. “I’m the 
werewolf!” he shrieked. His eyes were wild, excited. His face, surrounded 
by his long, tangled hair, was bright red. “I’m the werewolf!” 

He had heard Cassie! 

Laughing at the top of his lungs, he tossed up both hands, then began 
to swing the turkey in a wide circle over his head. “I’m the werewolf!” he 
cried. 

Cassie, Will, and I all cried out at the same time. 

Then we started to run. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Wolf. He hadn’t moved from 
his spot across the bog. But now, as I started to mn, he came bounding 
toward us, barking excitedly. 

“I’m the werewolf!” the hermit shrieked. He howled with laughter, still 
swinging the turkey as he chased after us. 

“Leave us alone!” Cassie cried, running beside Will a few steps ahead 
of me. “Do you hear me? Leave us alone!” 

Her pleas made the hermit howl again. 

My shoes slipped in the muddy ground. 

I turned back. He was gaining on me. Right behind me. 

Gasping for breath, I struggled to run faster. Sharp vines and heavy 
leaves slapped at my face and arms as I plunged forward. 

It was all a blur now. A blur of light and shade, trees and vines, tall 
weeds and sharp brambles. 

“I’m the werewolf! I’m the werewolf!” 

The crazed hermit’s high-pitched wails of laughter echoed through the 
swamp. 

Keep going, Grady, I urged myself. Keep going. 

Then, with a terrified cry, I felt my feet slide out from under me. 

I fell face forward into the mud, landing hard on my hands and knees. 

He’s got me, I realized. 

The werewolf has got me. 



22 


I tried frantically to scramble up from the mud. But I slipped again and 
tumbled forward with a splat. 

He’s got me now, I thought. 

The werewolf has got me now. I cannot escape. 

My muscles all froze in panic. I struggled to crawl away. 

I turned back, expecting the hermit to grab me. 

But he had stopped several yards away. The turkey dangled to the 
ground as he stared down at me, a strange grin on his weathered face. 

Where was Wolf? I wondered. 

Wolf had been growling furiously at the swamp hermit. Why hadn’t 
Wolf attacked? 

“Help! Will! Cassie!” I called desperately. 

Silence. 

They were gone. They were both probably out of the swamp by now, 
running for home. 

I was alone. Alone to face the hermit. 

I stumbled to my feet, my eyes locked on his. Why was he grinning at 
me like that? 

“Go on. Go,” he murmured, gesturing with his free hand. “Just teasing 
you.” 

“What?” My voice came out tiny and frightened. 

“Go. I’m not going to bite you,” he said. His grin faded. The light 
seemed to dim in his shiny black eyes. 

Wolf appeared behind him. The dog gazed up at the hermit, then 
lowered his eyes to the dead turkey. He barked once, a shrill yip. But I 
could see that Wolf had relaxed. He had no intention of attacking the 
hermit. 

“This dog yours?” the hermit asked, eyeing Wolf warily. 

“Yeah,” I replied, still breathing hard. “I... found him.” 

“Watch out for him,” the hermit said sharply. Then he turned and, 
hoisting the large bird on his shoulder, headed back into the weeds. 



“W-watch out for him?” I stammered. “What do you mean?” 

But the hermit didn’t reply. I could hear him brushing the tall weeds 
away as he disappeared back into the swamp. 

“What do you mean?” I called after him. 

But he was gone. The swamp was silent now except for the chirping 
and clicking of insects and the dry sound of palm leaves brushing against 
each other. 

I stared straight ahead at the tall weeds. I guess I expected the swamp 
hermit to return, to burst back into view, to attack again. 

Two white moths fluttered together over the weeds. Nothing else 
moved. 

He was teasing us, he had said. 

That’s all it was, just teasing. 

I swallowed hard. Then I forced myself to breathe normally again. 

After a while, I lowered my gaze to Wolf. The dog was busily sniffing 
the ground where the hermit had stood. 

“Wolf—why didn’t you protect me?” I scolded. 

The dog glanced up, then returned to his sniffing. 

“Hey, dog—are you a big coward?” I asked, brushing at the wet dirt on 
the knees of my jeans. “Is that your problem? You sound real tough, but 
you’re actually a big chicken?” 

Wolf ignored me. 

I turned and headed home, thinking about the hermit’s warning. As I 
made my way along the narrow path, I could hear Wolf running through the 
weeds and tall grass, following close behind. 

“Watch out for him, ” the hermit had said. 

Was he teasing about that, too? Was he just trying to scare me? 

The strange man saw that Will, Cassie, and I were afraid of him. So he 
decided to have some fun with us. 

That’s all it was, I decided. 

He heard Cassie call him a werewolf. So he decided to give us a real 
scare. 

As I walked along the marshy ground under the shade of the tilted 
palm trees, my mind spun with thoughts about Cassie and Will and Wolf 
and werewolves. 

I didn’t see the snake until I stepped on it. 



I glanced down in time to see its bright green head shoot forward. 
I felt a sharp stab of pain as its fangs dug into my ankle. 

The pain jolted up my leg. 

I uttered a choked gasp before I crumpled to the ground. 



23 


I hit the ground and curled into a tight ball as the pain throbbed through my 
body. 

Red dots formed in my eyes. The dots grew larger and larger until I 
saw only red. The color shimmered in rhythm to the throbbing pain. 

Through the curtain of red, I saw the snake slither into the bushes. 

I grabbed my ankle, trying to force the pain down. 

Slowly, the red faded, then vanished, leaving only the pain. 

My hand suddenly felt wet. 

Blood? 

I glanced down to see Wolf licking my hand. Fierce licking, as if 
trying to cure me, trying to make everything okay again. 

Despite the pain, I laughed. “It’s okay, boy,” I said. “I’m okay.” 

He kept licking my hand until I climbed to my feet. I felt a little dizzy. 
My legs were shaky. 

I tried putting weight on the foot that had been bitten. 

It felt a little better. 

I took a step, limping. Then another. 

“Let’s go, Wolf,” I said. He gazed up at me sympathetically. 

I knew I had to get home quickly. If the snake was poisonous, I was in 
big trouble. I had no way of knowing how much time I had before the 
venom would paralyze me completely—or worse. 

Wolf stayed by my side as I limped over the soft ground toward home. 
I was gasping for breath. My chest felt tight. The ground swayed beneath 
me. 

Was it because of the snake venom? Or was it just because I was so 
frightened? 

Pain shot up my side with every step I took. 

But I kept pulling myself along, talking to Wolf all the while, ignoring 
the throbbing ache of my ankle. 

“We’re almost there, Wolf,” I said, panting loudly. “Almost there, 
boy.” 



The dog sensed that something was seriously wrong. He stayed by my 
side instead of running his usual zigzag patterns in front of me and behind 
me. 

The end of the trees came into view. I could see bright sunlight just 
beyond the swamp. 

“Hey—” a voice called to me. I saw Will and Cassie waiting for me on 
the flat grass. 

They began running toward me. “Are you okay?” Cassie called. 

“No. I... I got bit!” I managed to choke out. “Please—go get my dad!” 

They both took off, running full speed to my house. I dropped down on 
the grass, spreading my legs straight out, and waited. 

I tried to stay calm, but it was impossible. 

Was the snake poisonous? Was the venom heading straight to my 
heart? Was I about to die any second? 

I reached down with both hands and carefully, carefully, pulled off my 
mud-covered sneaker. Then, moving it a tiny bit at a time, I lowered my 
white sock down over the ankle and off my foot. 

The ankle was a little swollen. The skin was red except for a white, 
puckered spot around the bite. Inside that spot, I saw two small puncture 
marks, bright red droplets of blood oozing from each hole. 

When I raised my eyes from the wound, I saw my dad, dressed in 
brown shorts and a white T-shirt, hurrying along the flat grass toward me, 
followed closely by Will and Cassie. 

“What happened?” I heard my dad ask them. “What happened to 
Grady?” 

“He was bitten by a werewolf!” I heard Cassie reply. 


* * * 


“Keep the ice pack on it,” Dad instructed. “The swelling will go down.” 

I groaned and held the ice pack against my ankle. 

Mom tsk-tsked from the kitchen table. She had a newspaper spread out 
in front of her. I couldn’t tell if she was tsk-tsking over me or over the day’s 
news. 

Outside the screen door I could see Wolf, on his side on the grass just 
past the back stoop, sound asleep. Emily was in the front room, watching 



some soap on TV. 

“How does it feel?” Mom asked. 

“A lot better,” I told her. “I think I was mainly scared.” 

“Green snakes aren’t poisonous,” Dad reminded me for the tenth time. 
“But I took every precaution, just in case. We’ll wrap it up really good 
when you’re through putting ice on it.” 

“What was all that talk about werewolves?” Mom asked. 

“Cassie has werewolves on the brain,” I said. “She thinks the swamp 
hermit is a werewolf.” 

“She seems like a sweet girl,” Mom said quietly. “I had a nice talk 
with her while your father was taking care of your bite. You’re lucky, 
Grady, to find two kids your age out here on the edge of a swamp.” 

“Yeah, I guess,” I replied, shifting the ice pack on the ankle. “But she 
was driving Will and me nuts with all her werewolf talk.” 

Dad was washing his hands in the kitchen sink. He dried them on a 
dish towel, then turned to me. “That old swamp hermit is supposed to be 
harmless,” he said. “At least, that’s what everyone says.” 

“Well, he gave us a real scare,” I told him. “He chased us through the 
swamp, shouting, T’m the werewolf!”’ 

“Weird,” Dad replied thoughtfully. He tossed the dish towel onto the 
counter. 

“You should stay away from him,” Mom said, looking up from the 
newspaper. 

“Do you believe in werewolves?” I asked. 

Dad snickered. “Your mom and I are scientists, Grady. We’re not 
supposed to believe in supernatural things like werewolves.” 

“Your father is a werewolf,” Mom joked. “I have to shave his back 
every morning so he’ll look human.” 

“Ha-ha,” I said sarcastically. “I’m serious. I mean, haven’t you heard 
the weird howls at night?” 

“Lots of creatures howl,” Mom replied. “I’ll bet you howled when that 
snake bit your ankle!” 

“Can’t you be serious?” I cried shrilly. “You know, the howls didn’t 
start until it was a full moon.” 

“I remember. The howls didn’t start until that dog showed up!” Emily 
called from the front room. 



“Emily, give me a break!” I shouted. 

“Your dog is a werewolf!” Emily called. 

“Enough werewolf talk,” Mom muttered. “Look. I’ve got hair growing 
on my palms!” She held up her hands. 

“That’s just ink off the newspaper,” Dad said. He turned to me. “See? 
There’s a scientific explanation for everything.” 

“I really would like to be taken seriously,” I said through clenched 
teeth. 

“Well...” Dad glanced outside. Wolf had rolled onto his back and was 
sleeping with all four legs up in the air. “The moon will look full for only 
two more nights,” Dad told me. “Tonight and tomorrow night. If the howls 
stop after tomorrow night, we’ll know it was a werewolf, howling at the full 
moon.” 

Dad chuckled. He thought it was all a big joke. 

We had no idea that something was about to happen that night that 
might change his opinion about werewolves—forever. 



24 


Will and Cassie came over after dinner. Mom and Dad were still loading 
dishes into the dishwasher and cleaning up. Emily had hurried into town to 
go to the only movie playing. 

I was walking around pretty well. The ankle barely hurt at all. Dad’s a 
pretty good doctor, I guess. 

The three of us settled in the front room, and we instantly got into an 
argument about werewolves. 

Cassie insisted that the swamp hermit wasn’t kidding, that he really 
was a werewolf. 

Will told her she was a complete jerk. “He only chased us because he 
heard you call him a werewolf,” he told Cassie angrily. 

“Why do you think he lives by himself way deep in the swamp?” 
Cassie demanded of Will. “Because he knows what happens to him when 
the moon is full, and he doesn’t want anyone else to know it!” 

“Then why did he scream to us that he was a werewolf this 
afternoon?” Will asked impatiently. “Because he was just joking, that’s 
why.” 

“Come on, guys. Let’s change the subject,” I said. “My parents are 
both scientists, and they say there’s no proof that werewolves exist.” 

“That’s what scientists always say,” Cassie insisted. 

“They’re right,” Will said. “There are no werewolves except in 
movies. You’re a real jerk, Cassie.” 

“You’re a jerk!” Cassie shouted back. 

I could see they’d had fights like this before. “Let’s play a game or 
something,” I suggested. “Want to play some Nintendo? It’s in my room.” 

“Mr. Warner still hasn’t shown up,” Cassie told Will, ignoring me. She 
tugged at her red ponytail, then tossed it behind her head. “You know why? 
Because he was murdered by the werewolf!” 

“Don’t be stupid,” Will said. “How do you know?” 

“Maybe you ’re the werewolf!” I told Cassie. 

Will laughed. “Yeah. That’s why you’re such an expert, Cassie.” 

“Oh, shut up,” Cassie grumbled. “You look more like a werewolf than 



me, Will!” 

“You look like a vampirel” he told her. 

“Well, you look like King Kong!” she cried. 

“What are you kids talking about?” Mom interrupted, poking her head 
into the room. 

“Just talking about movies and things,” I replied quickly. 

I couldn’t get to sleep that night. I kept rolling onto one side, then the other. 
I couldn’t get comfortable. 

I kept listening for the howls. 

A strong wind had come up from the Gulf. I could hear it rushing past 
our small house. It rattled the wire mesh of the deer pen out back. It made a 
constant ssshhhhhh sound, and I strained to hear the familiar howls. 

I had just about drifted off to sleep when the howls began. 

Instantly alert, I jumped to my feet. My left ankle ached as I stepped 
down on it. 

Another howl. Far off. Barely carrying over the steady rush of the 
wind. 

I limped to my bedroom window. The ankle had stiffened up a bit 
while I was lying in bed. I pressed my face against the glass and peered out. 

The full moon, gray as a skull, hovered low in the charcoal sky. The 
dewy grass gleamed under its blanket of pale light. 

A burst of wind rattled my window. 

Startled, I pulled back. And listened. 

Another howl. Closer. 

This one sent a cold shudder down my back. 

It sounded really close. Or was the wind carrying it from the swamp? 

I squinted out the window. Swirls of wind made the grass sway from 
one side to the other. The ground appeared to be spinning, glowing in the 
pale moonlight as it twirled. 

Another howl. Even closer. 

I couldn’t see anything. I had to know who or what was making that 
terrifying sound. 

I pulled my jeans on over my pajama bottoms. Struggling in the dark, I 
managed to slide my feet into a pair of flip-flops. 

I started out of my room, but stopped short when I heard a banging. A 



loud crash. A pounding. A harsh thud. 

Right outside. 

Right outside my house. 

My heart pounding, I ran through the dark hallway. My ankle ached, 
but I ignored it. 

I hurried through the kitchen, unlocked the back door, and pulled it 
open. A strong gust of wind pushed me back as I opened the screen door. 

The wind was hot and wet. Another strong gust pushed me back. 

The wind is trying to keep me inside, I thought. Trying to keep me 
from solving the mystery of the terrifying howls. 

I lowered my head against the driving gusts and leapt down off the 
stoop. 

“Ow!” I cried out as pain shot up my leg. 

Waiting for my eyes to adjust to the dim light, I listened hard. 

No howls now. Just the shrill, steady rush of wind, pushing, pushing 
me back against the house. 

The back yard glowed in the moonlight. Everything was silver and 

gray. 

And silent. 

I searched the back yard, my eyes sweeping slowly across the shifting 
grass. Empty. 

But what had caused all the commotion I’d heard in my room? The 
banging? The loud thuds ? The rattling sounds? 

Why had the howls stopped when I came outside? 

What a mystery, I thought. What a strange mystery. 

The wind swirled around me. My face was dripping wet from the 
heavy dampness of the air. 

Feeling defeated, I turned back toward the house. 

And uttered a shocked cry when I saw that the werewolf had murdered 
again. 



25 


I took a step through the swirling wind toward the deer pen. 

“Dad!” I called. But my voice came out a hushed whisper. “Dad!” I 
tried to shout, but my throat was too dry and choked with fear. 

Staring straight ahead, I took another step. I could see it all clearly 
now. A scene of death. Pale light and shadows. The only sounds were the 
pounding of my heart, the swell of the wind, and the rattling of the wire 
mesh of the pen. 

I took another step closer. “Dad? Dad?” I cried out without thinking, 
without hearing myself, knowing he couldn’t hear. 

But I wanted him to be there. I wanted someone to be there with me. I 
didn’t want to be all alone out there in the back yard. 

I didn’t want to be staring at the hole that had been ripped in the side 
of the pen. I didn’t want to see the murdered deer lying so pitifully on its 
side. 

The five remaining deer huddled together at the other end of the pen. 
Their eyes were on me. Frightened eyes. 

The wind swept around me, hot and wet. But I felt cold all over. A cold 
shudder of terror ran down my body. I swallowed hard. Once. Twice. 
Trying to choke down the heavy lump in my throat. 

Then, before I even realized what I was doing, I began running to the 
house, screaming, “Dad! Mom! Dad! Mom!” at the top of my lungs. 

My cries rose on the gusting wind like the terrifying howls I’d heard 
just a few moments before. 

His pajama shirt flapping over the jeans he had pulled on, Dad dragged the 
dead deer to the back of the yard. Then, as I watched from the kitchen 
window, he patched the deer pen with a large sheet of box cardboard. 

As he tried to return to the house, the strong winds nearly blew the 
screen door off its hinges. Dad jerked the door shut, then locked it. 

His face was dripping with perspiration. He had mud down the side of 
one pajama sleeve. 

Mom poured him a glass of water from the sink, and he drank it down 



without taking a breath. Then he wiped the sweat from his forehead with a 
dish towel. 

Tm afraid your dog is a killer,” he said softly to me. He tossed the 
towel back onto the counter. 

“It wasn’t Wolf!” I cried. “It wasn’t!” 

Dad didn’t reply. He took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. Mom 
and Emily watched silently from in front of the sink. 

“What makes you think it was Wolf?” I demanded. 

“I saw the prints on the ground,” he replied, frowning. “Paw prints.” 

“It wasn’t Wolf,” I insisted. 

“I’m going to have to take him to the pound in the morning,” Dad said. 
“The one over in the next county.” 

“But they’ll kill him!” I cried. 

“The dog is a killer,” Dad insisted softly. “I know how you feel, Grady. 
I know. But the dog is a killer.” 

“It wasn’t Wolf,” I cried. “Dad, I know it wasn’t Wolf. I heard the 
howls, Dad. It was a wolf.” 

“Grady, please—” he started wearily. 

Then the words just burst out of me. I lost all control of them. They 
just poured out in a flood. “It was a werewolf, Dad. There’s a werewolf in 
the swamp. Cassie is right. It wasn’t a dog, and it wasn’t a wolf. It’s a 
werewolf who’s been killing animals, who killed your deer.” 

“Grady, stop—” Dad pleaded impatiently. 

But I couldn’t stop. “I know I’m right, Dad,” I cried in a shrill voice 
that didn’t sound like me. 

“It’s been a full moon this week, right? And that’s when the howls 
began. It’s a werewolf, Dad. The swamp hermit. That crazy guy who lives 
in the shack in the swamp. He’s a werewolf. He told us he is. He chased us 
and he told us he’s a werewolf. He did it, Dad. Not Wolf. He killed the deer 
tonight. I heard him howling outside, and then—then—” 

My voice caught in my throat. I started to choke. 

Dad filled the glass with water and handed it to me. I gulped it down 
thirstily. 

He put a hand on my shoulder. “Grady, let’s talk about it in the 
morning, okay? We’re both too tired to think straight now. What do you 
say?” 



“It wasn’t Wolf!” I cried stubbornly. “I know it wasn’t.” 

“In the morning,” Dad repeated, his hand still on my shoulder. He held 
it there to comfort me, to steady me. 

I felt shaky. I was panting. My heart pounded. 

“Yeah. Okay,” I agreed finally. “In the morning.” 

I made my way slowly to my room, but I knew I wouldn’t sleep. 

The next morning, Dad was gone when I got up. “He went to the lumber 
yard,” Mom told me, “to get wire mesh to repair the pen.” 

I yawned and stretched. I had fallen into a restless sleep at about two- 
thirty. But I still felt tired and nervous. 

“Is Wolf out there?” I asked anxiously. I ran to the kitchen window 
before she could reply. 

I could see Wolf at the head of the driveway. He had a blue mbber ball 
between his front paws, and he was chewing at it furiously. 

“Bet he’s hungry for breakfast,” I muttered. 

I heard the crunch of gravel, and Dad’s car pulled up the drive. The 
trunk was opened partway, a roll of wire mesh bulging inside. 

“Morning,” Dad said as he came into the kitchen. His expression was 
grim. 

“Are you going to take Wolf?” I demanded immediately. My eyes 
were on the dog, chewing on the rubber ball outside. He looked so cute. 

“People in town are upset,” Dad replied, pouring himself a cup of 
coffee from the coffeemaker. “A lot of animals have been killed this week. 
And a guy who lives down the way, Ed Warner, has disappeared in the 
swamp. People are very worried. They’ve heard the howls, too.” 

“Are you taking Wolf away?” I repeated shrilly, my voice trembling. 

Dad nodded. His expression remained grim. He took a long sip of 
coffee. “Go look at the paw prints outside the pen, Grady,” he said, locking 
his eyes on mine. “Go ahead. Take a look.” 

“I don’t care about prints,” I moaned. “I just know—” 

“I can’t take any more chances,” Dad said. 

“I don’t care! He’s my dog!” I screamed. 

“Grady—” Dad set down the cup and started toward me. 

But I burst past him and ran to the door. Pushing open the screen door, 
I leapt off the back stoop. 



Wolf stood up as soon as he saw me. His tail started to wag. Leaving 
the blue rubber ball behind, he began loping toward me eagerly. 

Dad was right behind me. “I’m going to take the dog away now, 
Grady,” he said. “Do you want to come along?” 

“No!” I cried. 

“I have no choice,” Dad said, his voice just above a whisper. He 
stepped forward and reached for Wolf. 

“No!” I shouted. “No! Run, Wolf! Run!” 

I gave the dog a shove. Wolf turned to me uncertainly. 

“Run!” I screamed. “Run! Run!” 



26 


I gave Wolf another hard shove. “Run! Run, boy! Go!” 

Dad had his hands around Wolf’s shoulders, but he didn’t have a good 

grip. 

Wolf broke free and started to run toward the swamp. 

“Hey—!” Dad called angrily. He chased Wolf to the end of the back 
yard. But the big dog was too fast for him. 

I stood behind the house, breathing hard, and watched Wolf until he 
disappeared into the low trees at the edge of the swamp. 

Dad turned back toward me, an angry expression on his face. “That 
was dumb, Grady,” he muttered. 

I didn’t say anything. 

“Wolf will come back later,” Dad said. “When he does, I’ll have to 
take him away.” 

“But, Dad—” I started. 

“No more discussion,” he said sternly. “As soon as the dog returns, 
I’m taking him to the pound.” 

“You can’tl” I screamed. 

“The dog is a killer, Grady. I have no choice.” Dad headed toward the 
car. “Come help me unload this wire mesh. I’ll need your help getting the 
pen patched up.” 

I gazed toward the swamp as I followed Dad to the car. Don’t come 
back, Wolf, I pleaded silently. Please, don ’t come back. 

All day long, I watched the swamp. I felt nervous, shaky. I had no appetite 
at all. After I helped Dad repair the deer pen, I stayed in my room. I tried to 
read a book, but the words were just a blur. 

By evening, Wolf hadn’t returned. 

You’re safe, Wolf, I thought. At least for today. 

My whole family was tense. At dinner, we hardly spoke. Emily talked 
about the movie she had seen the night before, but no one joined in with 
any comments. 

I went to bed early. I was really tired. From tension, I guess. And from 



being up most of the night before. 

My room was darker than usual. It was the last night of the full moon, 
but heavy blankets of clouds covered the moonlight. 

I settled my head onto my pillow and tried to get to sleep. But I kept 
thinking about Wolf. 

The howls started a short while later. 

I crept out of bed and hurried to the window. I squinted out into the 
darkness. Heavy, black clouds still covered the moon. The air was still. 
Nothing moved. 

I heard a low growl, and Wolf came into focus. 

He was standing stiffly in the middle of the back yard, his head tilted 
up to the sky, uttering low growls. As I stared out the window at him, the 
big dog began to pace, back and forth from one side of the yard to the other. 

He’s pacing like a caged animal, I thought. Pacing and growling, as if 
something is really troubling him. 

Or scaring him. 

As he paced, he kept raising his head toward the full moon behind the 
clouds and growling. 

What is going on? I wondered. I had to find out. 

I got dressed quickly in the darkness, pulling on the jeans and T-shirt I 
had worn all day. 

I fumbled into my sneakers. At first I had the left one on the right foot. 
It was so dark in my room without the moonlight pouring in! 

As soon as my sneakers were tied, I hurried back to the window. Wolf 
was leaving the back yard, I saw. He was lumbering slowly in the direction 
of the swamp. 

I’m going to follow Wolf, I decided. I’m going to prove once and for 
all that he isn’t a killer—or a werewolf. 

I was afraid my parents might hear me if I went to the kitchen door. So 
I crawled out my window. 

The grass was wet from a heavy dew. The air was wet, too, and nearly 
as hot as during the day. My sneakers squeaked and slid on the damp grass 
as I hurried to follow Wolf. 

I stopped at the end of the back yard. I’d lost him. 

I could still hear him somewhere up ahead. I could hear the soft thud 
of his paws on the marshy ground. 



But it was too dark to see him. 

I followed the sound of his footsteps, gazing up at the shifting, 
shadowy clouds. 

I was nearly to the swamp when I heard footsteps behind me. 

With a gasp of fright, I stopped and listened hard. 

Yes. Footsteps. 

Moving rapidly toward me. 



27 


“Hey!” 

I let out a choked cry and spun around. 

At first, all I could see was blackness. “Hey—who’s there?” My voice 
came out in a hushed whisper. 

Will stepped out from the darkness. “Grady—it’s you!” he cried. He 
came closer. He was wearing a dark sweatshirt over black jeans. 

“Will—what are you doing out here?” I asked breathlessly. 

“I heard the howls,” he replied. “I decided to investigate.” 

“Me, too. I’m so glad to see you!” I exclaimed. “We can explore 
together.” 

“I’m glad to see you, too,” he said. “It was so dark, I—I didn’t know it 
was you. I thought—” 

“I’m following Wolf,” I told him. I led the way into the swamp. It 
grew even darker as we made our way under the low trees. 

As we walked, I told Will about the night before, about the murdered 
deer, the paw prints around the deer pen. I told him about how people in 
town were talking. And about how my dad planned to take Wolf away to 
the pound. 

“I know Wolf isn’t the killer,” I told him. “I just know it. But Cassie 
got me so scared with all her werewolf stories, and—” 

“Cassie is a jerk,” Will muttered. He pointed into the weeds. “Look— 
there’s Wolf!” 

I could see his black outline moving steadily through the heavy 
darkness. “I was so stupid. I should have brought a flashlight,” I murmured. 

Wolf disappeared behind the weeds. Will and I followed the sound of 
his footsteps. We walked for several minutes. Suddenly, I realized I could 
no longer hear the dog. 

“Where’s Wolf?” I whispered, my eyes searching the dark bushes and 
low trees. “I don’t want to lose him.” 

“He went this way,” Will called back to me. “Follow me.” 

Our sneakers slid over the damp, marshy ground. I slapped at a 
mosquito on the back of my neck. Too late. I could feel warm blood. 



Deeper into the swamp. Past the bog, eerily silent now. 

“Hey, Will?” 

I stopped—and searched. “Oh.” A soft cry escaped my lips as I 
realized I had lost him. 

Somehow we had gotten separated. 

I heard rustling up ahead. The crack of twigs. The whispering brush of 
weeds being stepped on and pushed out of the way. 

“Will? Is that you?” 

Or was it Wolf? 

“Will?” 

“Where are you?” 

Pale light suddenly washed over me, washed slowly over the ground. 
Glancing up, I saw the heavy clouds pull away. The yellow full moon 
hovered high in the sky. 

As the light slowly swept over the swamp, a low structure came into 
view straight ahead of me. 

At first, I couldn’t figure out what it was. Some kind of gigantic plant? 

No. 

As the moonlight shone down, I realized I was staring at the swamp 
hermit’s shack. 

I stopped, frozen in sudden fear. 

And then the howls began. 

The frightening sound tore through the heavy silence. A horrifying 
wail, so loud, so nearby, rose on the still air, rose and then fell. 

The sound was so terrifying, I raised my hands to cover my ears. 

The swamp hermit! I thought. He is a werewolf! 

I knew he was the werewolf. 

I’ve got to get away from here, I realized. I’ve got to get home. 

I turned away from the small shack. 

My legs were trembling so hard, I didn’t know if I could walk. 

Got to go! Got to go! Got to go! The words repeated in my mind. 

But before I could move, the werewolf burst out from behind a tree— 
and, howling its hideous howl, leapt onto my shoulders and shoved me to 
the ground. 



28 


As the yellow light of the full moon shone down, I gazed into the face of 
the werewolf as it pinned me to the ground. 

Its dark eyes glared out at me from a human face, a human face 
covered in wolf fur. It howled its rage, its animal snout opening wide to 
reveal two gleaming rows of wolf fangs. 

It’s a human wolf! I realized to my terror. A werewolf! 

“Get off!” I shrieked. “Will—get off me!” 

It was Will. The werewolf was Will. 

Even through the thick, matted wolf fur, I could recognize his dark 
features, his small, black eyes, his thick, stubby neck. 

“Will—!” I screamed. 

I struggled to push him away, to squirm out from under. 

But he was too powerful. I couldn’t move. 

“Will —get off!” 

He raised his fur-covered face to the moon and uttered an animal howl. 
Then, snarling out his rage, he lowered his beastly head and dug his fangs 
into my shoulder. 

I let out a shriek of pain. 

Blinding flashes of red filled my eyes. 

I thrust out my hands, kicked my legs—struggled blindly to free 
myself. 

But he had animal strength. He was much too strong for me... too 
strong... . 

The flashing red faded, turned to black. Everything was fading to 
black. I could feel myself sinking, sinking down a black tunnel, sinking 
forever into deep, deep, endlessly deep darkness. 

A loud growl brought me back. 

Bewildered, I gazed up to see Wolf leap onto Will. 

Will uttered a shrill howl of anger and turned to wrestle with the 
snarling dog. 

I watched in stunned disbelief as they scrabbled over the ground, 



biting and clawing, raging at each other, growling and grunting. 

“Will... Will, it was you... it was you all along....” I murmured, 
struggling to my feet. 

I gripped a tree trunk. The ground appeared to be sliding beneath me. 

The two creatures continued to battle, grunting and growling as they 
clawed at each other, wrestling over the wet ground. 

“I knew it wasn’t Wolf,” I muttered aloud. “I knew...” 

And then a deafening high-pitched shriek startled me, and I tumbled to 
my knees. 

I looked up in time to see Will running away, fleeing on all fours 
through the tall weeds. Wolf followed close behind, snapping at Will’s 
ankles, jumping on him, biting and clawing him as they ran. 

Then, I heard Will utter another cry of pain, a wail of defeat. 

As the anguished sound faded, I sank down, down, down into the blue- 
black darkness.

“You have a slight fever,” Mom said. “But you’ll be okay.” 

“Swamp fever,” I murmured weakly. I gazed up at her, trying to focus. 
Her face was blurred, hovering over me in the soft light. 

It took me a long while to realize I was in my own bedroom. “How— 
how did I get here?” I stammered. 

“The swamp hermit—he found you in the swamp and carried you 
home,” Mom said. 

“He did?” I tried to sit up, but my shoulder ached. To my surprise, it 
was tightly bandaged. “The—the werewolf—Will—he bit me,” I said, 
swallowing hard. 

Dad’s face, hovered beside Mom’s. “What are you saying, Grady? 
Why do you keep muttering about a werewolf?” 

I pulled myself up a little and told them the whole story. They listened 
in silence, glancing at each other from time to time as I talked. 

“Will is a werewolf,” I concluded. “He changed. Under the full moon. 
He changed into a wolf, and—” 

“I’m going to check this out right now,” Dad said, staring intently 
down at me. “Your story is crazy, Grady. Just crazy. Maybe it’s the fever. I 
don’t know. But I’m going right over to your friend’s house and see what’s 
what.” 

“Dad—be careful,” I called after him. “Be careful.” 

Dad returned a short while later, a bewildered look on his face. I was sitting 
in the living room, feeling a lot better, a big bowl of popcorn in my lap. 

“There’s no one there,” Dad said, scratching his head. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” Mom asked. 

“The house is empty,” Dad told us. “Deserted. It doesn’t look like 
anyone has lived there in months! ” 

“Wow, Grady. You certainly have strange friends!” Emily exclaimed, 
rolling her eyes. 

“I don’t get it,” Dad said, shaking his head. 

I didn’t, either. But I didn’t care. Will was gone. The werewolf was 



gone for good. 

“So can I keep Wolf?” I asked Dad, climbing up from the chair and 
crossing the room to him. “Wolf saved my life. Can I keep him?” 

Dad stared back at me thoughtfully, but didn’t reply. 

“The swamp hermit told us he saw the dog chase some kind of animal 
away from Grady,” Mom said. 

“Probably a squirrel,” Emily joked. 

“Emily, give me a break,” I groaned. “Wolf really saved my life,” I 
told them. 

“I guess you can keep him,” Dad said reluctantly. 

“YAY!” I thanked him and eagerly made my way to the back yard to 
give Wolf a happy hug. 

That all happened nearly a month ago. 

Since then, Wolf and I have had a wonderful time exploring the 
swamp. I’ve gotten to know just about every inch of Fever Swamp. It’s like 
my second home. 

Sometimes Wolf and I let Cassie come along exploring with us. She’s 
kind of fun, even though she’s always on the lookout for werewolves. I 
really wish she’d just drop the subject. 

I’m standing at my bedroom window now, watching the full moon 
rising over the distant trees. This first full moon in a month makes me think 
of Will. 

Will may be gone, but he changed my life. I know I’ll never forget 

him. 

I can feel the fur sprouting on my face. My snout is expanding, and my 
fangs are sliding out between my dark lips. 

Yes, when he bit me, Will passed the curse on to me. 

But I don’t mind. I’m not upset. 

I mean, with Will out of the way, the swamp is now mine! All mine! 

I’m climbing out of my window now. There’s Wolf waiting for me, 
eager to do some night exploring. 

I drop easily to the ground on all fours. I raise my fur-covered face to 
the moon and utter a long, joyful howl. 

Let’s go, Wolf. Let’s hurry to Fever Swamp. 

I’m ready to hunt.
