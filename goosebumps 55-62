ATE EVERYONE

“I used to believe in monsters,” Alex said. She pushed her glasses up on her 
nose. Her nose twitched. With her pink face and round cheeks, she looked like a 
tall, blonde bunny rabbit. 

“When I was little, I thought that a monster lived in my sock drawer,” Alex 
told me. “You won’t believe this, Zackie. But I never opened that drawer. I used 
to wear my sneakers without socks. Sometimes I tried to go barefoot to 
kindergarten. I was too scared to open that drawer. I knew the sock monster 
would bite my hand off! ” 

She laughed. Alex has the strangest laugh. It sounds more like a whistle 
than a laugh. “Wheeeeeeh! Wheeeeeh!” 

She shook her head, and her blonde ponytail shook with her. “Now that I’m 
twelve, I’m a lot smarter,” she said. “Now I know that there is no such thing as 
monsters.” 

That’s what Alex said to me two seconds before we were attacked by the 
monster. 


* * * 


It was spring vacation, and Alex and I were out collecting things. That’s what we 
do when we can’t think of anything better. 

Sometimes we collect weird-looking weeds. Sometimes we collect bugs. Or 
odd-shaped leaves. 

Once, we collected stones that looked like famous people. That didn’t last 
long. We couldn’t find too many. 

If you get the idea that Norwood Village is a boring town—you’re right! 

I mean, it was boring until the monster attacked. 

Alex Iarocci lives next door to me. And she is my best friend. 

Adam Levin, who lives across town, is my best friend too. I think a person 
should have a lot of best friends! 

I’m not sure why Alex has a boy’s name. I think it’s short for Alexandria. 
But she won’t tell me. 



She complains about her name all the time. It gives her a lot of trouble. 

Last year at school, Alex was assigned to a boys’ gym class. And she gets 
mail addressed to Mr. Alex Iarocci. 

Sometimes people have trouble with my name too. Zackie Beauchamp. My 
last name is pronounced BEECH-am. But no one ever knows how to say it. 

Why am I going on about names like this? I think I know why. 

You see, when the Blob Monster attacked, I was so scared, I forgot my own 
name! 

Alex and I had decided to collect worms. Only purple worms—no brown ones. 

That made the search more interesting. 

It had rained the day before, a long, steady, spring rain. Our backyards were 
still soft and spongy. 

The worms were coming up for air. They poked through the wet grass. And 
wriggled onto the driveway. 

We were both crouched down, searching for purple ones—when I heard a 
loud, squishy sound behind me. 

I spun around quickly. 

And gasped when I saw the monster. “Alex—look!” 

She turned too. And a whistling sound escaped her mouth. “Wheeeeh!” 
Only this time, she wasn’t laughing. 

I dropped the worm I had been carrying and took a biiig step back. 

“It—it looks like a giant human heart!” Alex cried. 

She was right. 

The monster made another loud squish as it bounced over the grass toward 
us. It bounced like a giant beach ball, taller than Alex and me. Nearly as tall as 
the garage! 

It was pink and wet. And throbbing. 

BRUM BRRUUM BRUMMM. It pulsed like a heart. 

It had two tiny black eyes. The eyes glowed and stared straight ahead. 

On top of the pink blob, I thought I saw curled-up snakes. But as I stared in 
horror, I realized they weren’t snakes. They were thick, purple veins—arteries 
tied together in a knot. 

BRRUUUM BRUM BRUMM. 

The monster throbbed and bounced. 

“Ohhhhhh!” I groaned as I saw the sticky trail of white slime it left behind 



on the grass. 

Alex and I were taking giant steps—backwards. We didn’t want to turn our 
backs on the ugly thing. 

“Unh unh unh!” Terrified groans escaped my throat. My heart had to be 
pounding at a hundred miles an hour! 

I took another step back. Then another. 

And as I backed away, I saw a crack open up in the creature’s middle. 

At first I thought the pink blob was cracking apart. 

But as the crack grew wider, I realized I was staring at its mouth. 

The mouth opened wider. Wider. 

Wide enough to swallow a human! 

And then a fat purple tongue plopped out. The tongue made a wet SPLAT as 
it hit the grass. 

“Ohhhhh. ” I groaned again. My stomach lurched. I nearly lost my lunch. 

The end of the tongue was shaped like a shovel. A fat, sticky, purple shovel. 

To shovel people into the gaping mouth? 

Thick, white slime poured from the monster’s mouth. “It—it’s drooling !” I 
choked out. 

“Run!” Alex cried. 

I turned—and tripped on the edge of the driveway. 

I landed hard on my elbows and knees. 

And looked back—in time to see the drooling, pink mouth open wider as 
the tongue wrapped around me... pulling me, pulling me in.

Alex stared at me, her mouth open wide. “Zackie, that is awesomel” she 
declared. 

Adam scratched his curly, black hair and made a face. “You call that 
scary?” He rolled his eyes. “That’s about as scary as Goldilocks and the Three 
Bears. ” 

I held the pages of my story in one hand. I rolled them up and took a swing 
at Adam with them. 

He laughed and ducked out of my reach. 

“That is an awesome story!” Alex repeated. “What do you call it?” 

“ ‘Adventure of the Blob Monster’,” I told her. 

“Oh, wow,” Adam exclaimed sarcastically. “Did you think that up all by 
yourself?” 

Alex gave Adam a hard shove that sent him tumbling onto the couch. “Give 
Zackie a break,” she muttered. 

The three of us were hanging out in Adam’s house. We were squeezed into 
what his parents call the rec room. 

The room is so small. Only a couch and a TV fit. 

It was spring vacation, and we were hanging out because we didn’t know 
what else to do. The night before, I stayed up till midnight, working on my scary 
story about the Blob Monster. 

I want to be a writer when I grow up. I write scary stories all the time. Then 
I read them to Alex and Adam. 

They always react in the same way. Alex always likes my stories. She 
thinks they’re really scary. She says that my stories are so good, they give her 
nightmares. 

Adam always says my stories aren’t scary at all. He says he can write better 
stories with one hand tied behind his back. 

But he never does. 

Adam is big and red-cheeked and chubby. He looks a little like a bear. He 
likes to punch people and wrestle around. Just for fun. He’s actually a good guy. 

He just never likes my stories. 

“What’s wrong with this story?” I asked him. 



The three of us were crammed onto the couch now. There was nowhere else 
to sit. 

“Stories never scare me,” Adam replied. He picked an ant off the couch 
arm, put it between his thumb and finger, and shot it at me. 

He missed. 

“I thought the story was really scary,” Alex said. “I thought you had really 
good description.” 

“I never get scared by books or stories,” Adam insisted. “Especially stories 
about dumb monsters.” 

“Well—what does scare you?” Alex demanded. 

“Nothing,” Adam bragged. “I don’t get scared by movies, either. Nothing 
ever scares me.” 

And then he opened his mouth wide in a scream of horror. 

All three of us did. 

We leaped off the couch—as a terrifying screech rang through the room. 

And a black shadow swept over the floor.

The shadow swooped by our feet, so fast I could barely see it. 

I felt something brush my ankle. Something soft—and ghostlike. 

“Whoooa!” Adam cried. 

I heard hurried footsteps from the living room. Mr. Levin—Adam’s dad— 
burst into the doorway. With his curly black hair and bearlike, round body, Mr. 
Levin looks a lot like Adam. 

“Sorry about that!” he exclaimed. “I stepped on the cat. Did it run past 
here?” 

We didn’t answer him. 

We were so stunned, we all burst out laughing. 

Mr. Levin frowned at us. “I don’t see what’s so funny,” he muttered. He 
spotted the cat, hiding beside the couch. He picked it up and hurried away. 

The three of us dropped back onto the couch. I was still breathing hard. And 
I could still feel the brush of the cat on my ankle. 

“See, Zackie?” Adam cried. He slapped me hard on the back—so hard I 
nearly fell off the couch. “That was a lot scarier than any story you could write.” 

“No way!” I insisted. “I can write a scarier story than that. The dumb cat 
just surprised us.” 

Alex pulled off her glasses and wiped the lenses on her T-shirt. “What a 
screech that cat made!” she exclaimed, shaking her head. 

“I wasn’t scared at all,” Adam claimed. “I was just trying to scare you 
guys.” He reached over and rubbed the palm of his hand back and forth over my 
head. 

Don’t you hate it when people do that? 

I slugged him as hard as I could. 

He only laughed. 

Alex and I stayed for dinner. Mrs. Levin is a great cook. We always try to be 
around Adam’s house at dinnertime because she always invites us to stay. 

It was dark by the time Alex and I started to walk home. We’d had 
thunderstorms the day before and most of today. The lawns glistened from the 
rain. The wet street reflected the glow of street lights. 



I could hear the crackle of thunder somewhere faraway. As Alex and I made 
our way along the sidewalk, cold rainwater dripped on us from the trees. 

Adam lives on the other side of Norwood Village. But it isn’t a very long 
walk—only about fifteen minutes. 

We walked for about five minutes when we came to a row of little shops. 

“Hey—!” I cried out when the antique store on the corner came into view. 
“It—it’s been totaled!” 

“It looks as if a bomb hit it!” Alex exclaimed. 

We stayed on the corner, staring across the street at it. Part of the roof had 
fallen in. All the windows were shattered. One wall had nearly caved in. The 
shingles on the walls and the roof had been burned black. 

“Was it a fire?” I wondered, leading the way across the street. 

“Lightning,” a woman’s voice replied. 

I turned to see two young women on the sidewalk beside the store. “It was 
struck by lightning,” one of them said. “Yesterday. During the big storm. The 
lightning started a huge fire.” 

“What a mess,” the other woman sighed. She pulled car keys from her 
pocketbook. 

The two women disappeared around the corner, tsk-tsking about the store. 

Alex and I stepped up to the front. 

“Ooh, it stinks,” Alex groaned, holding her nose. 

“It just smells burned,” I replied. I glanced down and saw that I had stepped 
into a deep puddle. 

I jumped back. 

“It’s soaked everywhere,” Alex murmured. “From the fire hoses, I guess.” 

A gust of wind made the front door bang. 

“It’s open!” I exclaimed. 

The door had been taped shut. But the tape had broken off. A large yellow 
sign on the door declared in big black letters: DANGER—KEEP OUT. 

“Alex—let’s take a peek,” I urged. 

“No way! Zackie—stop!” Alex cried. 

Too late. I was already inside.

I took a couple of steps into the shop and waited for my eyes to adjust to the 
darkness. Water dripped everywhere. An entire wall of shelves had toppled over. 
Broken vases, and lamps, and small statues lay scattered over the puddled floor. 

“Zackie—!” Alex grabbed my shoulder. “Zackie—get out of here!” she 
whispered. “This is really dangerous.” 

“Leave the door open,” I told her. “We need the light from the street.” 

“But what do you want to see?” Her voice echoed over the PLUNK PLUNK 
PLUNK of dripping water. 

She grabbed my other arm and started to tug me out. “Come on. You saw 
the sign. The whole building may fall in on us.” 

I jerked my arm away. My sneakers squished as I walked. The carpet was 
soaked. 

“I just want to look around for one second,” I told Alex impatiently. “This 
is cool!” 

“It isn’t cool,” she argued. “It’s really stupid.” 

A row of ugly antique masks stared at us from one wall. The masks were 
tilted at odd angles. Other masks stared up from where they had fallen on the 
floor. 

A tall wooden clock had its face burned black. Wooden duck decoys lay on 
their sides, burned and cracked. 

A creaking sound overhead made me jump. I heard Alex gasp. 

I raised my eyes to the ceiling. Part of it had fallen in. Was the rest about to 
collapse on top of us? 

“Zackie—let’s go!” Alex urged. She backed up toward the door. Her shoes 
squished over the soaked carpet. 

The door banged shut behind us. I turned and saw the wind blow it back 
open. 

PLINK PLINK Cold water dripped onto my shoulder. 

“If you don’t come, I’m going without you!” Alex called. “I mean it, 
Zackie.” 

“Okay, okay,” I muttered. “I’m coming. I just wanted to check out what 
happened.” 



“Hurry!” Alex urged. She was halfway out the door. 

I turned and started to follow her. 

But I stopped when something on a high shelf caught my eye. 

“Hey, Alex—” I called. “Look!” 

I pointed up to an old typewriter. “Wow. My dad used to have one like that 
when I was real little,” I said. 

“Zackie—I’m leaving,” Alex warned. 

“I love old typewriters!” I cried. “Look, Alex. I don’t think the fire hurt it. I 
think it’s in good shape. I just have to check it out. Okay?” 

I didn’t wait for her to reply. 

I crossed the room. Stepped up to the shelf. Stood on tiptoe and reached for 
the old typewriter. 

“OWWWWWWW!” 

I felt a hard shock of pain. It shot through my body. 

Stunned me. 

Took away my breath. 

Over my stunned cry, I heard the sharp crackle of electricity. 

And I bent over—helpless—as a bright blue flame shot around my body.

Blue. 

I saw only blue. 

The deepest blue I’d ever seen. 

I’m floating in the sky, I realized. I’m weightless. And I’m floating. 
Floating in the blue, blue sky. 

The blue faded to white. 

Was I still floating? Was I moving at all? 

Was I breathing? 

I struggled to speak. To shout. To make any kind of a sound. 

The white faded quickly. To gray. Then black. 

“Ohhhh,” I heard myself moan. 

Dark. So dark now. I was surrounded by darkness. 

I blinked. Blinked again. And realized I was staring into the darkness of the 
mined antique shop. 

“Zackie? Zackie?” 

I heard my name. Heard Alex repeating my name. 

I cleared my throat. I sat up. My eyes darted around the store. 

“Zackie? Zackie? Are you okay?” 

I tried to shake my dizziness away. My whole body tingled. Tingled and 
hummed, as if an electrical current were running through me. 

“How did I get on the floor?” I asked weakly. 

Alex leaned over me, one hand on my shoulder. “You got a shock,” she 
said, squinting hard at me through her glasses. “There must be a wire down or 
something.” 

I rubbed the back of my neck. I couldn’t stop the strange tingling or the 
steady hum in my ears. 

“Wow,” I murmured. 

“It was a real bad shock,” Alex said softly. “I—I was so scared. You were 
inside a blue flame. Your whole body—it turned bright blue.” 

“Wow,” I repeated, still fighting the dizziness. 

“Your hands shot up in the air,” Alex continued. “And then you bent in two. 



And fell to the floor. I—I thought...” Her voice trailed off. 

PLINKPLINK. 

I could hear the drip of water again. The hum in my ears had faded. 

I pulled myself shakily to my feet. I stretched my arms over my head, trying 
to stop the strange tingling. 

The old typewriter caught my eye again. 

“Zackie—what are you doing?” Alex cried. 

I moved carefully to the shelf, stepping around a puddle of water on the 
carpet. I took a deep breath. Stretched up on tiptoe. And pulled the old 
typewriter down. 

“Whoa—! It weighs a ton!” I cried. “It’s solid metal!” 

I held it in my arms and examined it. The sleek black surface caught the 
glow of the streetlight outside the door. The round keys poked up toward me. 

“It’s awesome!” I exclaimed. “This typewriter, Alex—it’s perfect for 
writing scary stories on.” 

“Are you crazy?” Alex declared. “Zackie, I think that electric shock messed 
up your brain!” 

“But look at it!” I insisted excitedly. “It’s perfect. Perfect!” 

Alex rolled her eyes. “You have a brand-new computer at home,” she 
reminded me. “And your mom gave you her old laser printer—remember?” 

“I know, I know,” I muttered. 

“You can print eight pages a minute,” Alex continued. “So what do you 
need a creaky old typewriter for?” 

“I need it because it’s perfect,” I told her. “Perfect! Perfect!” 

“Stop repeating that word,” she snapped. “Are you sure you’re feeling 
okay? That was a horrible shock. Maybe I should call your parents.” 

“No. No, I’m fine,” I insisted. The typewriter was growing heavy in my 
arms. “Let’s just go.” 

Lugging the typewriter, I started to the door. But Alex blocked my path. 

“You can’t just take it!” she scolded. “It doesn’t belong to you. That’s 
stealing.” 

I made a face at her. “Alex, don’t be dumb. Everything in this store is 
wrecked. Nobody will care if I take—” 

I stopped with a gasp when I heard the squish of shoes on the wet carpet. 

Then I heard a cough. 

I turned to Alex. Caught the fear on her face. 



She heard the sounds too. 

“Zackie, we’re not alone in here,” she whispered.

Another squishy footstep. Closer. 

A chill swept down my back. I nearly dropped the typewriter. 

“Hide,” I whispered. I didn’t need to suggest it. Alex was already slipping 
behind a tall display shelf. 

I set the typewriter down on the floor. Then I crept behind the shelf and 
huddled close to Alex. 

I heard another cough. And then a circle of light moved across the wet 
carpet. The pale yellow beam of a flashlight. 

The light slid over the floor. Then it started to climb the display case. Alex 
and I ducked low. The circle of light washed over our heads. 

My legs were trembling. I gripped the back of the case with both hands to 
keep myself from falling over. 

“Hello?” a voice called. A woman’s voice. “Hello? Is someone in here?” 

Alex turned to me. She motioned with her head. 

She was silently asking if we should step out and show ourselves. 

I shook my head no. 

How could we explain what we were doing inside the shop? How could we 
explain why we were hiding? 

Maybe the woman will leave, I told myself. Maybe she won’t find us. 

Who is she? I wondered. Does she own the store? 

I peered out around the bottom shelf. I could see the woman from the side. 
She was African-American. She had very short, dark hair. She wore a long 
raincoat. 

She moved the flashlight beam along the back wall. It lit up the fallen shelf, 
the broken antiques. 

Her footsteps slogged over the wet carpet. 

“Hello?” she called. “Did someone come in here?” 

I held my breath. 

Please leave, I begged silently. Please don’t catch us here. 

The woman turned. Her light stopped on the typewriter in the middle of the 
floor. She kept the light steady, staring at the typewriter. 



I knew what she was thinking: How did the typewriter get on the floor? 
Slowly, she raised the light. Raised it back to the display shelf. 

She stared right at us! 

Could she see us hiding behind the display case? 

I froze. I pretended to be a statue. 

Did she see us? 

No. 

She muttered something to herself. The light went out. 

I blinked in the sudden darkness. Her footsteps moved away. 

I realized I was still holding my breath. I let it out slowly, trying not to 
make a sound. 

Silence now. And darkness. 

No footsteps. No beam of yellow light. 

The front door banged shut. 

Alex and I exchanged glances. 

Was the woman gone? Did she leave the shop? 

We didn’t move. 

We waited. And listened. 

Silence... 

Then Alex sneezed. 

“Gotcha!” the woman cried from somewhere behind us.

A hand grabbed my shoulder. Hard. 

The sleeve of the raincoat brushed my face as the woman tugged me out 
from behind the shelf. I nearly tripped over the typewriter. The woman held me 
up by one arm. 

Alex stepped up beside me. Her ponytail had come undone. Her blonde hair 
was wild around her face. She kept swallowing hard, making dry, clicking 
sounds with her tongue. 

I guessed she was as frightened as I was. 

The woman switched her flashlight on. She raised it to my face, then to 
Alex’s. 

“Were you doing some late shopping?” she demanded. 

“Huh?” I managed to choke out. 

“The store is closed. Couldn’t you tell?” the woman snapped. 

She was young and pretty. She locked her dark eyes on me. 

“What are you doing in here?” she asked. 

I opened my mouth to answer, but no sound came out. 

“Uh... nothing,” Alex said weakly. “We weren’t doing anything.” 

The woman narrowed her eyes at Alex. “Then why were you hiding?” 

“You f-frightened us,” I stammered, finally finding my voice. 

“Well, you frightened me too!” the woman exclaimed. “You frightened me 
plenty. I was in the back room, and...” 

“We were walking home. We saw the store. How it was wrecked,” I 
explained. “We just wanted to see what it looked like inside. So we came in. 
That’s all.” 

The woman lowered the light to the floor. “I see,” she said softly. 

Her shoe made a squishing sound on the carpet. Water dripped steadily 
from the ceiling behind us. 

“What a mess,” the woman sighed. Her eyes traveled around the ruined 
shop. “I’m Mrs. Carter. I own this store. What’s left of it.” 

“We—we’re sorry,” Alex stammered. 

“You shouldn’t be in here,” Mrs. Carter scolded. “It’s very dangerous. 



Some of the electrical wires are down. You didn’t touch anything—did you?” 

“No. Not really,” Alex replied. 

“Well... just this old typewriter,” I said, gazing down at it. 

“I wondered how it got down there,” Mrs. Carter said. “Why did you move 

it?” 

“I... like it,” I told her. “It’s really cool.” 

“Zackie writes stories,” Alex told Mrs. Carter. “Scary stories.” 

Mrs. Carter let out a bitter laugh. “Well, you could certainly write a scary 
story about this place!” 

“I’ll bet I could write awesome scary stories on that old typewriter,” I said, 
staring down at it. 

“You want it?” Mrs. Carter asked quickly. 

“Yes,” I answered. “Is it for sale? How much does it cost?” 

Mrs. Carter motioned with one hand. “Take it,” she said. 

“Excuse me?” I didn’t think I’d heard her correctly. 

“Go ahead. Take it,” she repeated. “It’s yours. For free.” 

“Do you mean it?” I cried excitedly. “I can have it?” 

She nodded. 

“Thank you!” I could feel a grin spreading over my face. “Thanks a lot!” 

Mrs. Carter bent down and picked up something from the floor. “Here,” she 
said. She handed me a fountain pen. A very old-fashioned-looking fountain pen. 
Heavy and black with silvery chrome on it. 

“For me?” I asked, studying the pen. 

Mrs. Carter nodded again. She smiled at me. “It’s my Going-Out-of- 
Business Special Offer. You get a free pen with every typewriter.” 

“Wow!” I exclaimed. 

Mrs. Carter moved to the door and held it open. “Now, get out of here. Both 
of you,” she ordered. “It really is dangerous in here. I’m leaving too.” 

I hoisted the heavy, old typewriter into my arms. Balancing it against my 
chest, I followed Alex to the door. 

I felt so happy! I thanked Mrs. Carter five more times. Then Alex and I said 
good-bye and headed for our homes. 

The street was still wet. It glowed under the streetlights like a mirror. It 
didn’t look real. 

The walk home seemed to take forever. The typewriter grew heavier with 
each step I took. 



“Weird,” Alex muttered when we finally crossed onto our block. 

“Huh?” I groaned. My arms were about to fall off! The typewriter weighed 
a ton! 

“What’s weird, Alex?” 

“The way she gave you that valuable typewriter,” Alex replied thoughtfully. 
“Why is that so weird?” I demanded. 

“She seemed so eager to give it away. It’s almost as if she wanted to get rid 
of it,” Alex said. She headed toward her house, which is next door to mine. 

My knees buckled as I started up my driveway. My arms ached. My whole 
body ached. I struggled to hold on to the typewriter. 

“That’s crazy,” I muttered. 

Of course, I didn’t know how right Alex was. 

I didn’t know that carrying the old typewriter home would totally ruin my 

life.

I dragged the typewriter into the ranch house where I live. I was gasping for 
breath. My arms had gone numb. 

Mom and Dad were in the living room. They sat side by side on the couch, 
doing a crossword puzzle together. 

They love crossword puzzles. I’m not sure why. Both of them are terrible 
spellers. They can never finish a puzzle. 

Lots of times, they end up fighting about how to spell a word. Usually, they 
give up and rip the puzzle to pieces. 

Then a few days later, they start a new one. 

They both looked up as I lugged the typewriter toward my room. 

“What’s that?” Mom demanded. 

“It’s a typewriter,” I groaned. 

“I know that!” Mom protested. “I meant—where did you get it?” 

“It’s... a long story,” I choked out. 

Dad climbed up from the couch and hurried over to help me. “Wow. It 
weighs a ton,” he said. “How did you ever carry it home?” 

I shrugged. “It wasn’t so bad,” I lied. 

We carried it to my room and set it down on my desk. I wanted to try it out 
right away. But Dad insisted that I return to the living room. 

I told them the whole story. About lightning hitting the store. About going 
in to explore. About Mrs. Carter and how she gave me the typewriter. 

I left out the part about the bad electrical shock that knocked me to the 
floor. 

My parents are the kind of people who get upset very easily. I mean, they 
start yelling and screaming over crossword puzzles! 

So I never tell them much. I mean, why ruin their day—or mine? 

“Why do you need an old typewriter?” Mom asked, frowning at me. “No 
one uses typewriters anymore. You only see them in antique shops.” 

“I want to write my scary stories on it,” I explained. 

“What about your new computer?” Dad demanded. “What about the laser 
printer we gave you?” 



“I’ll use that too,” I said. “You know. For school-work and stuff like that.” 
Mom rolled her eyes. “Next Zackie will be writing with a feather quill and 
an inkwell,” she said. 

They both laughed. 

“Very funny,” I muttered. I said good-night and hurried down the hall to my 
room. 

I turned the corner that led to my bedroom—and stopped. 

What was that strange crackling sound? 

It seemed to be coming from my room. A steady, crackling buzz. 

“Weird,” I muttered. 

I stepped into the doorway, peered into my room—and gasped!

“My typewriter!” I cried. 

The typewriter was bathed in a bright blue glow. Blue sparks buzzed and 
crackled off and flew in all directions. 

I stared in amazement as the blue current snapped and hummed over the 
typewriter. 

I thought about the shock that had knocked me to the floor in the antique 
shop. Had the typewriter stored up some of that electricity? 

No. That was impossible. 

But then why was the typewriter glowing under a crackling, blue current 
now? 

“Mom! Dad!” I called. “Come here! You have to see this!” 

They didn’t reply. 

I hurtled down the hall to the living room. “Quick! Come quick!” I shouted. 
“You won’t believe this!” 

They had returned to their crossword puzzle. Dad glanced up as I burst into 
the room. “How do you spell 'peregrine’?” he asked. “It’s a kind of falcon.” 

“Who cares?” I cried. “My typewriter—it’s going to blow up or 
something!” 

That got them off the couch. 

I led the way, running full speed down the hall. They followed close behind. 

I stopped at my doorway and pointed to my desk. “Look—!” I cried. 

All three of us peered across the room. 

At the typewriter. The black metal typewriter with its black roller and rows 
of black keys ringed with silver. 

No blue. 

No blue electrical current. No sparks. No crackle or buzz. 

Just an old typewriter sitting on a desk. 

“Funny joke,” Dad muttered, rolling his eyes at me. 

Mom shook her head. “I don’t know where Zackie gets his sense of humor. 
Not from my side of the family.” 

“Your side of the family doesn’t need a sense of humor. They’re already a 



joke!” Dad snapped. 

They walked off arguing. 

I edged slowly, carefully, into my room. I crept up to the typewriter. 
I reached out a hand. I lowered it toward the typewriter. 

Lowered it until it was less than an inch away. 

Then I stopped. 

My hand started to shake. 

I stared down at the solid, dark machine. 

Should I touch it? 

Would it shock me again? 

Slowly... slowly, I lowered my hand.

Alex slammed her locker shut. She adjusted her backpack and turned to me. “So 
what happened? Did the typewriter zap you?” 

It was the next morning. Spring vacation was over. School had started 
again. 

I had hurried down the hall to our lockers to tell Alex the whole typewriter 
story. I knew she was the only person in the world who would believe me. 

“No. It didn’t zap me,” I told her. “I touched it, and nothing happened. I 
pushed down some of the keys. I turned the roller. Nothing happened.” 

Alex stared hard at me. “Nothing?” 

“Nothing.” 

“That isn’t a very good story,” she teased. “It has a very weak ending.” 

I laughed. “Do you think it would be a better ending if I got fried?” 

“Much better,” she replied. 

It was late. The first bell had already rung. The hall was nearly empty. 

“I’m going to rewrite the Blob Monster story,” I told her. “I have a lot of 
new ideas. I can’t wait to start working on it.” 

She turned to me. “On the old typewriter?” 

I nodded. “I’m going to make the story longer—and scarier. That old 
typewriter is so weird. I know it’s going to help me write scarier than ever!” I 
exclaimed. 

I heard giggling. 

I spun around and saw Emmy and Annie Bell. They’re twins, and they’re in 
our class. Adam came trailing after them. He punched me in the shoulder—so 
hard, I bounced against the lockers. 

Emmy and Annie are good friends with Adam. But not with Alex and me. 

They both have curly red hair, lots of freckles, and lots of dimples. The only 
way to tell Emmy from Annie is to ask, “Which one are you?” 

Emmy grinned at me. I mean, I think it was Emmy. “Do you really believe 
in monsters?” she asked. 

They both giggled again, as if Emmy had asked something really funny. 

“Maybe,” I replied. “But I wasn’t talking about real monsters. I was talking 
about a scary story I’m writing.” 



And then I added nastily, “You two wouldn’t understand—since you 
haven’t learned to write yet!” 

“Ha-ha,” they both said sarcastically. “You’re so funny, Zackie.” 

“Funny-looking!” Adam added. The oldest joke in the universe. 

“But do you believe in monsters?” Emmy insisted. 

“Adam says you do,” her sister added. “Adam says you think a monster 
lives under your bed!” 

“I do not!” I screamed. 

They both giggled. 

“Adam is a liar!” I cried. I tried to grab him, but he dodged away from me, 
laughing his head off. 

“Zackie sees monsters everywhere,” Adam teased, grinning at Emmy and 
Annie. “He thinks when he opens his locker door, a monster will jump out at 
him.” 

They giggled again. 

“Give me a break,” I muttered. “We’re going to be late.” 

I turned away from their grinning faces. I turned the lock on my locker and 
pulled open the door. 

Then I knelt down to pull out my books. 

And something leaped out of my locker! 

I saw a white flash. 

“Huh?” I cried out in surprise. 

Another one jumped out. 

And then I gasped when something plopped onto my head. Something 
alive! 

I fell to my knees. Reached up to grab for it. I felt its claws tangle in my 
hair. “Help!” I cried. “Help me!” 



11 


The creature moved across my head. 

And dropped down the back of my shirt! 

Its hot body slid down my skin. Its claws prickled and pinched. 

“Help me! Help!” I jumped up, kicking and stomping and squirming. 

I frantically slapped at my back. 

Adam stepped up to me. He grabbed me by the shoulders. Then he tugged 
open the back of my shirt. 

And plucked the creature off my back. 

He held his hand in front of my face. “Wow! What a monster!” he 
exclaimed. “That’s scaaaaaaryl” 

Still trembling, I stared at the creature. 

A white mouse. 

A little white mouse. 

Emmy and Annie were doubled over beside Adam, laughing their heads off. 

Even Alex was laughing. Great friend, huh? 

“Zackie, I guess you really do see monsters everywhere!” Annie exclaimed. 
“Even teeny white ones!” 

That got them all laughing again. 

“Did you see that awesome dance he did?” Adam asked. Adam did an 
imitation of my frantic dance. He slapped at his head and neck and stomped 
wildly on the floor. 

“Excellent!” Emmy and Annie declared together. 

They all laughed again. 

Alex stopped laughing and stepped up beside me. She brushed something 
off my shoulder. 

“Mouse hair,” she murmured. 

Then she turned to the others. “We should give Zackie a break,” she told 
them. “Someday he’s going to be a famous horror writer.” 

“Someday he’s going to be a famous chicken !” Annie exclaimed. 

Emmy made clucking sounds and flapped her elbows. 

“Do you believe it? The famous horror writer is afraid of mice!” Adam 



cried. 

Emmy and Annie thought that was really funny. Their red hair bobbed up 
and down as they laughed. 

Emmy glanced at her watch—and gasped. “We’re really late!” 

She and her sister spun around and ran down the hall. Adam put the mouse 
in his pocket and went tearing after them. 

I knelt down to pull my books from the bottom of my locker. I reached in 
carefully. I had to make sure there were no more mice. 

Alex stood over me. “You okay?” she asked softly. 

“Go away,” I snapped. 

“What did I do?” Alex demanded. 

“Just go away,” I muttered. 

I didn’t want her around. I didn’t want anyone around. 

I felt like a total jerk. 

Why did I let little mice scare me like that? Why did I have to freak out in 
front of everyone? 

Because I’m a total jerk, I decided. 

I shoved books and a Trapper Keeper into my backpack. Then I stood up 
and started to close my locker. 

Alex leaned against the wall. “I told you to go away,” I snapped at her 
again. 

She started to reply, but stopped when Mr. Conklin, the principal, turned the 
corner. 

Mr. Conklin is a tall, pencil-thin man, with a narrow, red face and big ears 
that stick out like jug handles. He talks really fast. Always runs instead of 
walking. And always seems to be moving in eight directions at once. 

He eyed Alex, then me. “Who let the mice out of the science lab?” he 
demanded breathlessly. 

“Th-they were in Zackie’s locker—” Alex started. 

Before she could explain the rest, Mr. Conklin narrowed his eyes at me. His 
face grew even redder. 

“Zackie, I’d like to see you in my office,” he ordered. “Right now.” 



12 


I didn’t say much at dinner. 

I kept wondering if I should tell Mom and Dad about my adventures at 
school that day. But I decided to keep silent. 

I didn’t need them laughing at me too. 

And I didn’t need them asking a million questions about what Mr. Conklin 
said to me. 

He had been pretty nice about it, actually. He just warned me to try to keep 
live creatures out of my locker. 

After dinner, Dad and I loaded the dishwasher and cleaned up. I was 
sponging off the dinner table when Alex appeared. “How’s it going?” she asked. 
“Did Mr. Conklin—” 

I slapped a hand over her mouth to shut her up. 

I could see Mom and Dad watching from the other room. “What about Mr. 
Conklin?” Mom demanded. 

“He’s a nice guy,” I replied. 

I dragged Alex to the den. “So? How’s it going?” she repeated. 

“How’s it going?” I cried shrilly. “How’s it going? How can you ask me 
‘how’s it going’?” 

“Well...” she started. 

“It’s going terrible !” I cried. “I had the worst day! Kids were laughing at 
me all day. Everywhere I went, kids made mouse faces at me and squeaked at 
me.” 

She started to smile, but cut it off. 

“I don’t know why I lost it like that this morning,” I continued. “I felt so 
dumb. I—” 

“It was just a joke,” Alex interrupted. “No big deal.” 

“Easy for you to say,” I grumbled. “You didn’t have a hundred disgusting 
rodents crawling all over your body.” 

“A hundred?” Alex said. “How about one?” 

“It seemed like a hundred,” I mumbled. I decided to change the subject. 
“Look at this,” I said. 

I walked over to the desk by the window. After school, I had worked there 



for three hours. I picked up a stack of pages. 

“What are those?” Alex asked, following me to the desk. 

“My new Blob Monster story,” I replied, holding up the handwritten pages. 
“I’m making it even scarier.” 

Alex took the pages from my hand and shuffled through them. Then she 
narrowed her eyes at me. “You didn’t type them on the old typewriter?” 

“Of course not.” I took the pages back. “I always write the first draft by 
hand. I don’t type my stories until I’ve got them just right.” 

I picked up the pen from the desk. “I used the antique pen that woman gave 
me in the shop,” I told Alex. “What a great pen. It writes so smoothly. I can’t 
believe she gave it to me for free!” 

Alex laughed. “You’re such a weird guy, Zackie. You get so excited about 
things like pens and typewriters.” And then she added, “I think that’s cool.” 

I glanced over my story. “Now it’s time to type it,” I said. “I’m so excited. I 
can’t wait to use the old typewriter.” 

I led the way into my room. I was halfway to my desk when I stopped. 

And let out a startled cry. 

The typewriter was gone. 



13 


Alex and I both gaped at the empty spot on the front of my desktop. Alex pushed 
up her glasses and squinted. 

“It—it’s gone,” I murmured weakly. My knees started to buckle. I grabbed 
my dresser to hold myself up. 

“Weird,” Alex muttered, shaking her head. “Are you sure—” 

“It just disappeared into thin air!” I interrupted. “I don’t believe this! How? 
How could it disappear?” 

“How could what disappear?” a voice called from the doorway. 

I whirled around—to see Dad lumber heavily into the room. He carried the 
old typewriter in his arms. 

“Dad—why... ?” I started. 

He set it down on the desk. Then he pushed his curly black hair off his 
forehead and grinned at me. “I cleaned it for you, Zackie,” he said. “And put in a 
new ribbon.” 

He wiped sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand. “Ribbons are 
hard to find these days,” he added. “No one uses typewriters anymore.” 

Alex laughed. “Zackie thought the typewriter disappeared into thin air!” 

I flashed Alex an angry look. “Alex—give me a break,” I whispered. 

She made a face at me. 

Dad shook his head. “It’s a little too heavy to disappear into thin air,” he 
sighed. “It weighs a ton! More than a computer!” 

I walked over to the typewriter and ran my hand over the smooth, dark 
metal. “Thanks for cleaning it up, Dad,” I said. “It looks awesome.” 

“A few of the keys were sticking,” Dad added. “So I oiled them up. I think 
the old machine is working fine now, Zackie. You should be able to write some 
great stories on it.” 

“Thanks, Dad,” I repeated. 

I couldn’t wait to get started. I reached into my top drawer for some paper. 
Then I noticed that Dad hadn’t left. He was lingering by the door, watching Alex 
and me. 

“Your mom went across the street to visit Janet Hawkins, our new 
neighbor,” he said. “It’s such a beautiful spring night. I thought maybe you two 



would like to take a walk into town to get some ice cream.” 

“Uh... no thanks,” Alex replied. “I already had dessert at home. Before I 
came over.” 

“And I really want to get started typing my new scary story,” I told him. 

He sighed and looked disappointed. I think he really wanted an excuse to 
get ice cream. 

As soon as he left, I dropped into my desk chair. I slid a fresh, white sheet 
of paper into the typewriter roller. 

Alex pulled up a chair and sat beside me. “Can I try the typewriter after 
you?” she asked. 

“Yes. After me,” I replied impatiently. 

I really wanted to get my story typed. 

I let my eyes wander over the round, black keys. Then I leaned forward and 
started to type. 

Typing on a typewriter is a lot different from typing on a keyboard. For one 
thing, you have to press the keys a lot harder. 

It took me a few tries to get the feel of the thing. 

Then I typed the first words of the story: 

IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT. 

“Hey—!” I uttered a cry as lightning flashed in my bedroom window. 

Rain pounded on the glass. 

A sharp roar of thunder shook the house. 

Darkness swept over me as all the lights went out. 

“Zackie—?” Alex cried in a tiny voice. “Zackie? Zackie? Are you all 
right?” 



14 


I swallowed hard. “Yes. I’m okay,” I said quietly. 

Alex is the only person in the world who knows that I’m afraid of the dark. 

I’m afraid of mice. And I’m afraid of the dark. 

I admit it. 

And I’m afraid of a lot of other things. 

I’m afraid of big dogs. I’m afraid of going down to the basement when I’m 
all alone in the house. I’m afraid of jumping into the deep end of the swimming 
pool. 

I’ve told Alex about some of my fears. But not all of them. 

I mean, it’s kind of embarrassing. 

Why do I write scary stories if I’m afraid of so many things? 

I don’t know. Maybe I write better stories because I know what being 
scared feels like. 

“The lights went off so suddenly,” Alex said. She stood beside me, leaning 
over my desk to see out the window. “Usually they flicker or something.” 

Sheets of rain pounded against the windowpane. Jagged streaks of lightning 
crackled across the sky. 

I stayed in my desk chair, gripping the arms tightly. “I’m glad Adam isn’t 
here,” I murmured. “He’d just make fun of me.” 

“But you’re not very scared now—are you?” Alex asked. 

An explosion of thunder made me nearly jump out of the chair. 

“A little,” I confessed. 

And then I heard the footsteps. Heavy, thudding footsteps from out in the 

hall. 

Thunder roared again. 

I spun away from the window. And listened to the footsteps, thudding 
heavily on the carpet. 

“Who’s there?” I called through the darkness. 

I saw a flicker of yellow light in the doorway. A shadow swept over the 
wallpaper in the hall. 

Dad stepped into the room. “This is so weird,” he said. He was carrying two 



candles in candlesticks. Their flames bent and nearly went out as he carried them 
to my desk. 

“Where did that storm come from?” Dad asked, setting the candles beside 
my typewriter. “Are you okay, Zackie?” 

I forgot. Dad also knows I’m scared of the dark. 

“I’m fine,” I told him. “Thanks for the candles.” 

Dad stared out the window. We couldn’t really see anything out there. The 
rain was coming down too hard. 

“The sky was clear a few seconds ago,” Dad said, leaning over me to get a 
better view. “I can’t believe such a big storm could blow in so quickly.” 

“It’s weird,” I agreed. 

We stared at the rain for a minute or so. Sheets of lightning made the 
backyard glow like silver. 

“I’m going to call your mother,” Dad said. “I’m going to tell her to wait out 
the storm.” He patted me on the back, then headed to the door. 

“Don’t you want a candle?” I called after him. 

“No. I’ll find my way,” he replied. “I have a flashlight in the basement.” He 
disappeared down the hall. 

“What do you want to do now?” Alex asked. Her face looked orange in the 
candlelight. Her eyes glowed like cat eyes. 

I turned back to the typewriter. “It would be cool to write by candlelight,” I 
said. “Scary stories should always be written by candlelight. I’ll bet that’s how 
all the famous horror writers write their stories.” 

“Cool,” Alex replied. “Go ahead.” 

I slid the candlesticks closer. The yellow light flickered over the typewriter 

keys. 

I leaned forward and read over the first sentence of my story: 

IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT. 

Then I hit the space bar and typed the next sentence: 

THE WIND BEGAN TO HOWL. 

I hit the space bar again. And raised my fingers to type the next sentence. 

But a rattling noise made me jump. 

“What is that?” I gasped. 

“The window.” Alex pointed. 

Outside, the wind blew hard, rattling the windowpane. 

Over the steady roar of the rain, I heard another sound. A strange howl. 



I gripped the arms of my desk chair. “Do you hear that?” I asked Alex. 

She nodded. Her eyes squinted out the window. 

“It’s just the wind,” she said softly. “It’s howling through the trees.” 

Outside, the howling grew louder as the wind swirled around my house. 
The window rattled and shook. 

The howling grew high and shrill, almost like a human voice, a human wail. 
I felt a chill run down my back. 

Gripping the chair arms tightly, I struggled to keep my fear down. 

It’s just a storm, I told myself. Just a rainstorm. Just a lot of rain and wind. 

I glanced at the words I had typed. In the flickering, orange light, the black 
type jumped out at me: 

THE WIND BEGAN TO HOWL. 

I listened to the shrill howl outside. It seemed to surround me, surround the 
house. “How strange,” I muttered. And then, things got a lot stranger. 



15 


“You’re not getting very far with the story,” Alex said. 

“Well, the storm—” I started. 

She put a hand on my shoulder. “You’re shaking!” she exclaimed. 

“No, I’m not!” I lied. 

“Yes, you are. You’re shaking,” she insisted. 

“No way. I’m okay. Really,” I said, trying to keep my voice calm and 
steady. “I’m not that afraid, Alex.” 

“Maybe if you work on the story, you won’t think about the storm so 
much,” she suggested. 

“Right. The story,” I agreed. 

An explosion of thunder shook the house. 

I let out a sharp cry. “Why does it seem so close?” I exclaimed. “The 
lightning and thunder—it sounds as if it’s all right in the backyard!” 

Alex grabbed my shoulders and turned me to the typewriter. “Type,” she 
ordered. “Pretend there is no storm. Just type.” 

I obediently raised my hands to the keys of the old typewriter. The candles 
had burned down a little, and the page was shadowy and dark. 

I typed the next sentence: 

ALEX AND ZACKIE WERE ALONE IN THE DARK HOUSE, 
LISTENING TO THE STORM. 

Rain pounded hard against the window. In a white flash of lightning, I 
could see the trees in the backyard, bending and trembling in the howling wind. 

“The story is about us?” Alex asked, leaning over my shoulder to read what 
I had typed. 

“Of course,” I replied. “You know that I always write about us and the other 
kids at school. It makes it easier to describe everyone.” 

“Well, don’t let the Blob Monster eat me!” she instructed. “I want to be the 
hero. Not the dinner!” 

I laughed. 

A crash of thunder made me jump. 

I turned back to the typewriter. I squinted to read over the sentences I had 



typed. 

“The candles aren’t giving enough light,” I complained. “How did writers 
do it in the old days? They must have all gone blind!” 

“Let’s go and get more candles,” Alex suggested. 

“Good idea,” I agreed. 

We each picked up a candlestick. Holding them in front of us, we made our 
way down the hall. 

The candles bent and flickered. Our footsteps were drowned out by the 
steady roar of rain on the roof. 

“Dad?” I called. “Hey, Dad—we need more candles!” 

No reply. 

We stepped into the living room. Two candles glowed on the mantelpiece. 
Two more stood side by side on the coffee table in front of the couch. 

“Dad?” I called. “Where are you?” 

Holding our candles high, Alex and I made our way to the den. Then the 
kitchen. Then Mom and Dad’s bedroom. 

No Dad. 

Holding my candle tightly in one hand, I pulled open the door to the 
basement. “Dad? Are you down there?” 

Silence. 

I felt another tingling chill run down my back. I turned to Alex. “He—he’s 
gone!” I stammered. “We’re all alone!” 



16 


“He has to be here,” Alex insisted. “Why would he go out in this storm?” 

“For ice cream?” I suggested. “He really wanted some ice cream.” 

Alex frowned. “Your dad would go out in this storm to get a cup of ice 
cream? That’s impossible.” 

“You don’t know my dad!” I replied. 

“He’s here,” Alex insisted. She set down the candle and cupped her hands 
around her mouth. “Mr. Beauchamp? Mr. Beauchamp?” she called. 

No reply. 

Wind howled outside the living-room window. Lightning flickered. 

“Hey—!” I cried. 

In the flash of bright light, I saw a car in the driveway. Dad’s car. 

I made my way to the window and peered out. “Dad didn’t drive 
anywhere,” I told Alex. “His car is still here. And he wouldn’t walk.” 

“Mr. Beauchamp? Mr. Beauchamp?” Alex tried again. 

“Weird,” I muttered. “He wouldn’t go out without telling us—would he? He 
—he just disappeared.” 

Alex’s eyes flashed. Her expression changed. She narrowed her eyes at me. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked. “Why are you staring at me like that?” 

“Zackie—what was the last sentence you typed?” she demanded, still 
squinting at me. 

“Huh?” 

“In your story,” she said impatiently. “What was the last sentence?” 

I thought hard. Then I recited it: 

“ALEX AND ZACKIE WERE ALONE IN THE DARK HOUSE, 
LISTENING TO THE STORM.” 

Alex nodded her head solemnly. 

“So what?” I asked. “What does the story have to do with anything?” 

“Don’t you see?” Alex replied. “You wrote that we were all alone in the 
house—and now we’re all a/one!” 

I stared back at her. I still didn’t know what she was talking about. 

“Zackie—this is amazing!” she cried. “What is the first sentence of the 



story?” 

I told it to her: 

“IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT.” 

“Yes!” Alex cried excitedly. Her eyes went wide. The candle shook in her 
hand. “Yes! A dark and stormy night! But it had been a nice night—right?” 

“Huh?” I struggled to follow her. 

“Your dad said there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. Remember? That’s why he 
wanted to walk into town.” 

“Yeah. Right. So what?” I demanded. 

She let out an impatient sigh. “So then you typed that it was dark and 
stormy—and guess what? It became dark and stormy.” 

“But, Alex—” I started. 

She raised a finger to her lips to silence me. “And then you typed that we 
were all alone in the dark house. And that came true too!” 

“Oh, no!” I groaned. “You’re not going to tell me that my story is coming 
true—are you?” 

“So far it has,” she insisted. “Every word of it.” 

“That’s really dumb,” I told her. “I think this storm has freaked you out 
more than me!” 

“Then how else do you explain it?” Alex shot back. 

“Explain it? A big rainstorm came up. That’s how I explain it.” 

I picked up a candlestick from the mantel. Now I had one in each hand. I 
started back to my room. 

Alex followed me. “How do you explain your dad disappearing into thin 

air?” 

Our shadows edged along the wall, bending in the flickering light. I wished 
the electricity would come back on. 

I stepped into my room. “Dad didn’t disappear. He went out,” I told Alex. I 
sighed. “Your idea is crazy. Just because I typed that it was stormy out...” 

“Let’s test it,” Alex urged. 

“Excuse me?” 

She dragged me to the desk chair. She pushed me into it. 

“Hey—” I protested. “I almost dropped the candles.” 

“Type something,” Alex instructed. “Go ahead, Zackie. Type something— 
and we’ll see if it comes true.” 



17 


The wind howled outside the house, rattling the windowpane. I set my candles 
down, one on each side of the old typewriter. 

I leaned forward and read the story so far. 

Alex was right. 

Everything I had typed had come true. 

But her idea was totally dumb. 

“Type!” she ordered, standing behind me, her hands on my shoulders. 

I glanced back at her. “Alex—haven’t you ever heard of coincidence ?” 

“Oooh—big word!” she replied sarcastically. “Are you sure you’re ready 
for such a big word?” 

I ignored her remark. “A coincidence is when two things happen by 
accident,” I explained. “For example, I type that it’s stormy out—and then it 
starts to storm. That’s called a coincidence.” 

She shoved me toward the typewriter. “Prove it,” she insisted. “Go ahead, 
Zackie. Type the next sentence, and let’s see if it comes true.” 

She squeezed my shoulders. And then added, “Or are you chicken?” 

I wriggled out from under her hands. “Okay, okay,” I groaned. “I’ll prove 
just how dumb you are.” 

I reached for the handwritten pages of the story. And I found the next 
sentence. 

Then I raised my hands to the old typewriter keyboard and typed it in: 

THEY HEARD A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. 

I lowered my hands to my lap. And sat back. 

“See?” I sneered. “Any more bright ideas?” 

Then I heard a knock on the door! 

I gasped. 

Alex let out a startled cry. 

“That didn’t h-happen,” I stammered. “I didn’t hear that. I imagined it.” 

“But we both heard it,” Alex replied, her eyes wide. “We both couldn’t 
imagine it!” 

“But it’s impossible !” I insisted. I picked up a candle. Then I jumped up 



from the desk chair and hurried across the bedroom. 

“Where are you going?” Alex demanded, chasing after me. 

“To answer the door,” I told her. 

“No—!” she gasped. 

I was already jogging through the dark hall. My heart pounded. The candle 
flame seemed to throb in rhythm with my heart. 

I glanced back and saw Alex running after me. “Zackie—wait!” 

I didn’t stop. I ran to the front door. 

“No! Please—don’t open it!” Alex pleaded. 

“I have to,” I told her. “We have to see who’s there.” 

“Zackie—don’t!” Alex begged. 

But I ignored her. And pulled open the door. 



18 


Alex gasped. 

I stared out into the rain. 

No one there. 

No one. 

Rain pattered the front stoop. The big raindrops bounced like balls in every 
direction. 

I pushed the door shut. And brushed a cold raindrop off my forehead. 

“Weird,” Alex muttered, tugging at her blonde ponytail. She pushed her 
glasses up on her nose. “Weird.” 

“It had to be a tree branch,” I said. “The wind blew a tree branch against the 
door. That’s all.” 

“No way,” Alex insisted. “Tree branches don’t knock. I heard a knock on 
the door—and so did you.” 

We stared at each other for a long moment. Then we stared at the door. 

“I know!” Alex declared. Behind her glasses, her eyes flashed excitedly. “I 
know why there was no one at the door!” 

“I don’t want to know!” I groaned. “I don’t want to hear any more crazy 
ideas about my story coming true.” 

“But don’t you see?” she cried. “There was no one at the door because you 
didn’t write someone at the door!” 

“AAAAAGGH!” I screamed. “Alex, please—give me a break. You don’t 
really believe that I am controlling everything that happens—do you?” 

She twisted her face, thinking hard. 

“No,” she finally replied. 

“Good!” I exclaimed. 

“I think the old typewriter is controlling everything,” she said. 

“Alex—go lie down,” I instructed. “I’m calling your parents to come get 
you. You are sick. Definitely sick.” 

She ignored me. “Maybe that’s why the woman in the burned-out shop gave 
you the typewriter,” she continued. “Maybe she knew it had strange powers. And 
she couldn’t wait to get rid of it.” 



“I can’t wait to get rid of you!” I snapped. “Alex, please tell me you’re not 
serious. You’re scaring me with this nutty talk. Really.” 

“But, Zackie, I’m right. Everything you type—it comes true!” Alex grabbed 
my arm and started to pull me down the hall. 

I pulled back. “Where are you taking me?” I demanded. 

“One more test,” she insisted. 

I followed her into my room. “One more?” I asked. “One more test—and 
then you’ll shut up about this?” 

She raised her right hand. “Promise.” She lowered her hand. “But, you’ll 
see, Zackie. You’ll see that I’m not crazy. Whatever you type on that old 
typewriter comes true.” 

I sat down at the desk and slid the candles closer to the typewriter. I stared 
into the flickering orange light, reading the words of the story. 

“Hurry up,” Alex urged. “Type that someone is standing on the other side of 
the door.” 

“Okay, okay,” I muttered. “But this is crazy.” I raised my hands to the old 
typewriter keys and typed: 

DRENCHED WITH RAIN, ADAM STOOD ON THE FRONT PORCH. 

I lowered my hands to my lap. 

I listened for a knock on the front door. 

But all I heard was the steady rush of the wind and the patter of rain against 
the house. 

I waited, listening hard. 

No knock. 

I realized I was holding my breath. I let it out slowly, listening. Listening. 

“No knock,” I told Alex. I couldn’t keep a grin from spreading across my 
face. A triumphant grin. “See? It didn’t work.” 

She frowned. She leaned over my shoulder and read the words again. “Of 
course it didn’t work,” she said. “You didn’t write that Adam knocked. You put 
him on the porch. But you didn’t make him knock.” 

I sighed. “Okay. If it will make you happy...” 

I turned back to the typewriter and typed: 

ADAM KNOCKED ON THE FRONT DOOR. 

As I lowered my hands from the keys, I heard a loud knock on the front 

door. 

“See?” Alex cried. It was her turn to grin. 



“This can’t be happening!” I gasped. 

We didn’t bother with candles. We both ran full speed through the hall to 
the front door. 

Alex reached it first. She grabbed the knob and pulled open the door. 

“Is it really Adam?” I called. 



19 


I gaped in shock as Alex pulled Adam in from the rain. 

He was drenched! His curly black hair was matted to his forehead. He 
wasn’t wearing a rain slicker or jacket. His soaked T-shirt stuck to his body. 

“Whoooa!” he exclaimed, shivering. He wrapped his arms around his 
chubby body as if trying to warm himself. 

Water poured off him and puddled on the floor. 

“Adam—!” I opened my mouth to say something—but I was too shocked to 
form words. 

“It—it’s true!” Alex stammered. “It really works!” 

“Huh?” Adam appeared dazed. 

“What are you doing here?” I demanded, feeling dazed myself. 

His eyes wandered around the living room. “I’m not sure!” he exclaimed. “I 
—I know I came here for a reason. But I don’t remember what it is.” 

“Zackie made you come here!” Alex declared. 

Adam shook his head hard, shaking water off himself like a dog. He 
narrowed his eyes at Alex. “Excuse me?” 

Alex studied Adam. “Did you stand on the front porch for a while before 
you knocked?” she demanded. 

Adam nodded. “Yeah. I did! I’m not sure why. I just stood there. I guess I 
was trying to remember why I came over here. How did you know that?” 

Alex grinned at me. “See? I was right all along.” 

I swallowed hard. My head was spinning. “Yes. You were right,” I 
murmured. 

The old typewriter... 

Whatever I typed on it came true. 

“What’s going on?” Adam demanded impatiently. He shook more water 
onto the rug. “Why are we in the dark?” 

“The storm knocked out the lights,” I told him. “Follow me.” 

I led the way to my room. On the way, I stopped at the linen closet and gave 
Adam a bath towel. He dried himself off as we walked to my room. 

I couldn’t wait to tell him about my amazing typewriter. “You’re not going 



to believe this!” I started. 

I took him over to the typewriter. He stared at it in the orange candlelight. 

Then Alex and I told him the whole story. 

When we finished, Adam burst out laughing. “Very funny,” he said. 

He shook his head. His curly hair was still soaked. Water dripped down his 
forehead. 

“I know you want to pay me back, Zackie,” he said. “I know you want to 
pay me back for putting the mice in your locker. I know I embarrassed you in 
school.” 

He put a moist hand on my shoulder. “But there is no way I’m going to fall 
for a dumb story like that. No way.” 

“Zackie will prove it to you,” Alex chimed in. 

Adam sneered and rolled his eyes. “I can hardly wait.” 

“No. Really,” I insisted. “It’s not a joke, Adam. It’s real. Come here. I’ll 
show you.” 

I pulled him up to the desk. Then I dropped into the chair and quickly typed 
the next lines of my scary story: 

THE STORM STOPPED SUDDENLY. ALL WAS QUIET. TOO QUIET. 

Adam and Alex read the words over my shoulder. 

I jumped up and pulled Adam to the window. “Go ahead. Check it out,” I 
urged. 



20 


All three of us slid around my desk and pressed our faces to the window. 

“Yes!” I cried, shaking my fists above my head. “Yes!” 

The rain had stopped. 

I edged between my two friends and pushed up the window. “Listen,” I 
instructed. 

We all listened. 

Not a sound outside. Not even the drip of rain from the trees. Not even a 
whisper of wind. 

“Yes!” Alex cried happily. She and I slapped a high five. 

I turned to Adam. “Do you see?” I cried. “Do you believe us now?” 

“Do you see?” Alex repeated. 

Adam backed away from the window. “See what?” he demanded. “Do I see 
that the rain has stopped? Yes. I see it.” 

“But—but—” I pointed to the typewriter. 

Adam laughed. “Have you both lost it?” he cried. 

“Do you really think you stopped the rain? You two are totally messed up!” 

“It’s true!” I insisted. “Adam, I just proved it to you.” 

He laughed and rolled his eyes. 

I wanted to punch his laughing face. I really did. 

Here was the most amazing thing that ever happened to anyone in the 
history of the world—and he thought it was a big joke! 

I grabbed his arm. “Here,” I said breathlessly. “HI prove it again. Watch.” 

I dragged him to the typewriter. 

I didn’t bother to sit down. I leaned over the desk and started to type 
something. 

But before I had typed two words, Alex tugged me away. 

“What are you doing?” I cried. I struggled to break away. But she pulled me 
out to the hall. 

“He’s not going to believe us, Zackie,” she whispered. “You can prove it to 
him a dozen times, and he won’t believe it.” 

“Of course he will!” I insisted. “He’ll—” 



“No way,” Alex interrupted. “Go ahead. Type ADAM HAS TWO HEADS. 
If you do it, both of his heads won’t believe you!” 

I had to think about that one. 

“One more try,” I said. “Let me type one more sentence. When Adam sees 
it come true, maybe he’ll change his mind. Maybe he’ll see it isn’t a joke.” 

Alex shrugged. “Go ahead. But he has his mind made up, Zackie. He thinks 
you’re trying to pay him back for the mice in your locker.” 

“One more try,” I insisted. 

I glanced into the room. “No—! Adam—stop!” I shrieked. 

He had his back turned to us. But I could see that he was leaning over the 
typewriter. 

He was typing something onto the page! 

“Adam—stop!” Alex and I both wailed. 

We dove into the room. 

He spun around, a wide grin on his face. “I’ve got to go!” he exclaimed. 

He swept past us and out into the hall. “So long, suckers!” he called. He 
disappeared down the hall. 

I hurtled to the desk. My heart pounding, I stared down at the typewriter. 

What did Adam type? 



21 


I heard the front door slam. Adam had run out of the house. 

I didn’t care about Adam now. I only cared about one thing. 

What did he type on the old typewriter? 

I grabbed the sheet of paper—and pulled it from the roller. Then I held it 
close to a candle flame to read it. 

“Careful! You’ll set it on fire!” Alex warned. 

I moved it back from the flame. Orange light flickered over the page. My 
hand was trembling so hard, I struggled to read it. 

“Well? What did he type?” Alex asked impatiently. 

“He—he—he—” I sputtered. 

She grabbed the paper from my hand and read Adam’s sentence out loud: 

“THE BLOB MONSTER HID IN ZACKIE’S BASEMENT, WAITING 
FOR FRESH MEAT.” 

“What a jerk!” I cried. “I don’t believe him! Why did he type that on my 
story?” 

Alex stared unhappily at the page. “He thought it was funny.” 

“Ha-ha,” I said weakly. I grabbed the page back from her. “He ruined my 
story. Now I have to start it all over again.” 

“Forget your story. What about the Blob Monster?” Alex cried. 

“Huh?” A chill tightened the back of my neck. The sheet of paper slipped 
from my hand. 

“Everything typed on the old typewriter comes true,” Alex murmured. 

I was so upset about Adam ruining my story that I had forgotten! 

“You mean—?” I started. My mouth suddenly felt very dry. 

“There is a Blob Monster waiting in the basement,” Alex said in a low 
whisper. “Waiting for fresh meat.” 

“Fresh meat,” I repeated. I gulped. 

Alex and I froze for a moment, staring at each other in the darting 
candlelight. 

“But there is no such thing as a Blob Monster,” I said finally. “I made it up. 
So how can a Blob Monster be hiding in my basement?” 



Alex’s eyes flashed behind her glasses. “You’re right!” she cried. “They 
don’t exist! So... no problem!” She smiled. 

But her smile faded when we heard a noise. 

A heavy THUD THUD. 

I gasped. “What was that?” 

We both turned to the door. 

And heard the sound again. THUD THUD. 

Heavy and slow. Like footsteps. 

“Is it... is it coming from the b-b-b-?” I was so scared I was stuttering. 

Alex nodded. “The basement,” she whispered, finishing the word for me. 

I picked up a candlestick. The light bounced over the wall and floor. I 
couldn’t stop my hand from shaking. 

Holding it in front of me, I made my way into the hall. 

Alex huddled close, keeping with me step for step. 

THUD THUD. 

We both stopped. The sounds were closer. Louder. 

Taking a deep breath, I stepped up to the basement door. 

Alex hung back, her hands pressed to her face. Behind her glasses, her eyes 
were wide with fear. 

THUD THUD. 

“It’s coming up the stairs!” I cried. “Run!” 

Too late. 

I heard another THUD —and the door crashed open. 



22 


Abeam of white light made me shut my eyes. 

My hands shot up to shield myself. 

Behind the beam of light, a large, dark figure lumbered heavily through the 

door. 

“Dad!” I gasped. 

My dad lowered the flashlight to the floor. 

“Dad! What were you doing down there?” I demanded in a high, shrill 
voice. 

“Are you two okay?” Dad asked, narrowing his eyes at us. “Why do you 
look so frightened?” 

“We... uh... well...” I didn’t know how to explain. I couldn’t tell him we 
thought he was a Blob Monster! 

Dad pointed to the basement with the flashlight. “I’ve been down there 
checking the circuit breakers,” he explained. “I can’t figure out why the lights 
haven’t come back on.” He scratched his head. 

“We were looking for you,” Alex said. “We shouted down to the basement 
for you.” 

“I went across the street to check on your mother. Then I went into the back 
room of the basement,” Dad replied. “I guess I couldn’t hear you.” 

He shook his head. “What a strange storm. It came up so suddenly. And 
then it just stopped. As if someone turned it on, then turned it off.” 

Alex and I glanced at each other. “Yes. It was weird,” Alex agreed. 

I took a deep breath. “Uh... Dad?” I started. 

He beamed the light at my feet. “Yes, Zackie?” 

“Dad... when you were down in the basement... was there anything else 
down there with you?” 

His heavy eyebrows rose up on his forehead. He stared hard at me. “Excuse 
me?” 

“Did you see anything strange down there? Or hear anything strange?” 

He shook his head. “No. Nothing.” His eyes locked on mine. “Are you 
afraid, Zackie? I know you have problems with being in the dark like this. 
Would you like to hang out with me for a while?” 



“No. I’m fine. Really,” I insisted. “I just wondered...” 

Dad stepped past us and started toward the kitchen. “I’m going to call the 
electric company,” he said. “They should have fixed the lines by now.” 

I watched him make his way down the hall. The white beam of light 
bounced in front of him. 

I held my candle up to the basement door. “I guess the typewriter didn’t 
work this time,” I told Alex happily. “No Blob Monster.” 

“Let’s go downstairs and check it out!” she replied. 

“Huh?” I backed away from the open doorway. “Are you crazy?” 

“We have to know if the old typewriter has powers or not,” Alex said. “We 
have no choice, Zackie. We have to check out the basement.” 

“But—but—” 

She pushed past me onto the basement stairway. She walked down the first 
two steps. 

Then she turned back to me. “Are you coming with me, or not?” 



23 


Did I have a choice? 

No. 

For one thing, I had the candle. I couldn’t let Alex go down there by herself 
—in total darkness. 

But I held back, my heart pounding, my mouth dry as cotton. “Dad said he 
didn’t hear anything,” I said. “So there is no reason for us to go.” 

“That’s lame and you know it,” Alex replied. She took another step down. 
“Am I going down alone?” 

I forced my rubbery legs to move. “No. Wait up. I’m coming,” I said. 

I lowered my foot to the first stair. “But we’ll only stay down for a second 
—right?” 

“Just long enough to see if there is a Blob Monster hiding down there,” 
Alex replied. 

Waiting for fresh meat, I added silently. 

I stumbled on the next step. But caught myself on the railing. 

The candle flame dipped low, but didn’t blow out. 

The basement spread in front of us like a black pit. 

We both stopped at the bottom of the steps—and listened. 

Silence. 

I raised the candle high. Tall stacks of cartons came into view. Behind them, 
I could see the two wooden wardrobe closets where Mom and Dad store our 
winter clothes. 

“The Blob Monster could be hiding behind those tall cartons,” Alex 
whispered. “Or in those closets.” 

I swallowed hard. “Alex—give me a break,” I whispered back. 

We made our way slowly to the stacks of cartons. I raised the candle high. 
We peeked behind the first stack. 

Nothing hiding there. 

“Can we go now?” I pleaded. 

Alex rolled her eyes. “Don’t you want to know the truth? Don’t you want to 
know if your typewriter really has powers or not?” 



“No. Not really,” I whispered. 

She ignored me. She grabbed the candle from my hand and moved behind 
the next stack of cartons. 

“Hey—give that back!” I cried. 

“You’re too slow,” she snapped. “Keep close behind me. You’ll be okay.” 

“I’m not okay,” I insisted. “I want to go back upstairs.” 

Alex moved quickly between the stacks of cartons. I had to hurry to keep 
up. 

I never liked the basement. In fact, I was afraid of the basement even in the 
daytime. 

I knew there really wasn’t anything to be afraid of. But sometimes, telling 
yourself that doesn’t do any good at all. 

“Alex—” I whispered. “Can we—?” 

I stopped when I heard the sound. A soft slapping, from somewhere against 
the wall. 

Slap ... slap... slap... slap... 

Steady as a heartbeat. 

Alex had moved away from me. I saw her walking quickly toward the 
laundry room. 

“Alex—!” I hurtled across the room to her—so fast, I bumped into her. 

“Hey—watch it!” she exclaimed. 

“Alex—it’s down here!” I shrieked. “It’s here! It’s really here! Listen! Do 
you hear it?” 



24 


We both froze. 

The steady, rhythmic sound rose up from the far wall. 

Slap ... slap... slap... slap... 

“Do you hear it?” I whispered. 

Alex nodded. Her mouth had dropped open in shock. She gripped the 
candlestick in both hands. 

Slap... slap... 

“What are we going to do?” I whispered. 

“It’s waiting for fresh meat,” Alex murmured. 

“I know. I know!” I groaned. “You don’t have to say it.” I pulled her arm. 
“Come on. We have to tell Dad.” 

I gazed through the darkness to the stairway. The steps seemed a million 
miles away. 

“We’ll never make it,” I choked out. “We have to run past the Blob Monster 
to reach the stairs.” 

Slap... slap... 

“What’s our choice?” Alex shot back. “Pick one, Zackie. Choice one: We 
stay here. Choice two: We don’t stay here.” 

She was right, of course. We had to make a run for it. 

Maybe if we ran fast enough, we’d take it by surprise. 

Maybe the Blob Monster was too big to run fast. 

Slap... slap... slap... slap... 

“Let’s go,” Alex urged. “I’ll go first since I have the light.” 

“Uh... can we run side by side?” I asked softly. 

She nodded. 

Without another word, we took off. 



25 


Our shoes thudded over the concrete basement floor. 

I struggled to keep at Alex’s side. My legs felt so heavy, as if I were 
running uphill! 

“Whoooa!” I cried out when the lights flashed on. 

Startled, we both stopped running. 

I blinked hard, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the bright ceiling light. 

Slap... slap... 

We both turned to the far wall to see the Blob Monster. 

And stared at a pale white hand slapping against the wall beneath the open 
basement window. 

A hand? 

Slap... slap... 

“It—it’s a rubber glove!” Alex exclaimed. 

“It’s one of Dad’s gardening gloves,” I choked out. 

Dad usually leaves his heavy gardening gloves on that window ledge. One 
of the gloves was hanging from a nail. And the wind kept slapping it against the 
wall. 

Alex laughed first. Then I joined in. 

It felt good to laugh. And it felt especially good to know that no Blob 
Monster was hiding in the basement. 

What a relief! 

Alex and I climbed happily up the stairs. Then she made her way to the 
front door. “Thanks for the awesome entertainment!” she teased. “It was better 
than a movie! See you tomorrow.” 

She started out the door, then turned back. “We definitely got a little crazy 
tonight, Zackie. I mean, about that old typewriter.” 

“Yeah. I guess,” I admitted. “It doesn’t have any special powers. It didn’t 
make a Blob Monster appear in the basement. And all the lights came back on 
without me having to type that they came on.” 

“The typewriter didn’t cause anything to happen tonight. It was all 
coincidence,” Alex said. 



“Oooh. Big word!” I teased. 

She slammed the door behind her. 


“Are you doing anything, Zackie?” Mom asked. 

“Not really.” 

It was Saturday afternoon, and I was just hanging out. I had a ton of 
homework to do. So I was lying on the couch, staring up at the ceiling, thinking 
up excuses not to do it. 

“Can you run to the store for me?” Mom asked. “The Enderbys are coming 
for dinner, and I need a few things.” She held up a slip of paper. “It’s a short 
list.” 

“No problem,” I said, climbing up from the couch. 

Maybe I can add a few items to the list, I thought, taking it from her hand. 
Like maybe a few candy bars. Or a box of Pop-Tarts.... 

I love to eat Pop-Tarts raw. 

“Ride your bike, okay?” Mom asked. “I’m kind of in a hurry. Come straight 
back—okay?” 

“No problem,” I repeated. I tucked the list into the back pocket of my jeans 
and headed to the garage to get my bike. 

The afternoon sun poured down. The air felt hot and dry. More like summer 
than spring. 

I jumped onto my bike and pedaled down the driveway standing up. I 
turned toward town and sat down, pedaling fast, riding no-hands. 

A few minutes later, I leaned my bike against the brick wall of Jack’s. 
Jack’s is mainly a meat market, but they sell fruits, and vegetables, and other 
groceries too. 

The bell over the glass door clanged as I stepped inside. Mrs. Jack was at 
her usual spot, leaning her elbows on the counter beside the cash register. 

Mrs. Jack is a big, platinum-haired woman with about a dozen chins. She 
wears bright red lipstick and long, dangling earrings. 

She is really nice to everyone—except kids. 

She hates kids. I guess she thinks we only come into her store to steal. 
When a kid comes in, she follows him up and down the aisles and never takes 
her eyes off him. 

I closed the door behind me and reached into my back pocket for my 
shopping list. 



Mrs. Jack had the newspaper spread out in front of her on the counter. She 
raised her eyes slowly and made a disgusted face at me. “Help you?” she 
muttered. 

I waved the list. “Just buying a few things for my mom.” 

She grabbed the list out of my hand and squinted at it. Then she handed it 
back with a grunt. “Tuna is in the back on the bottom,” she said. 

“Thanks.” I picked up a shopping basket and hurried to the back of the 
store. 

A big air conditioner rattled against the wall. A fan in front of it blew cold 
air down the narrow aisle. 

I found the tuna quickly and dropped two cans into my basket. 

The long, white display counter of the meat department stretched in front of 
me. Behind the glass, cuts of red meat were lined up in perfect rows. 

Beside the counter, an enormous side of beef hung from the ceiling. 

That is really gross! I thought. 

It looked like an entire cow—stripped of its hide—hanging upside down. 

Yuck. 

I started to turn away from it—when the dead cow moved. 

It swung to the right, then swung back. 

I stared in surprise. 

The cow swung further, to the right, then back. 

I watched it swinging on its rope, swinging heavily from side to side. 

And then I heard a harsh, whispered voice: 

“Fresh meat... Fresh meat...” 



26 


“Ohhh.” A low moan escaped my throat as I gaped at the side of beef, swinging 
so slowly, back and forth, back and forth. 

“Fresh meat .. ” came the raspy whisper again. “Fresh meat .. ” 

“No—!” I blurted out. 

I dropped my shopping basket. 

And started to step back. 

I let out another cry as Adam stood up and stepped out from behind the 
meat counter. He had a gleeful grin on his face. 

“Fresh meat...” he whispered. And burst out laughing. 

Annie and Emmy climbed out from behind the counter, giggling and 
shaking their heads. 

“Awesome!” Annie exclaimed. 

“Zackie, you’re bright red!” her sister laughed. 

My face burned as hot as the sun. I felt so embarrassed. How could I fall for 
such a dumb joke? 

Now, I knew, they would tell everyone in school that I freaked out over a 
side of beef! 

“What are you doing here?” I shrieked. 

“We saw you on your bike,” Adam replied. “We followed you into the 
store. Didn’t you see us? We were right behind you.” 

“AAAAGFL!” I let out a furious cry and balled my hands into fists. 

“What’s going on back there?” Mrs. Jack’s harsh voice rattled the shelves. 
“What are you kids doing?” 

“Nothing!” I called. “I—I found the tuna!” 

I turned back to Adam and the twins. “Give me a break,” I muttered. 

For some reason, that struck them funny. They giggled and slapped one 
another high fives. 

Then Adam stuck out both arms. He held them stiffly in front of him, like a 
sleepwalker. And began marching stiff-legged across the aisle toward me. 

“You’re controlling me, Zackie!” he declared in a machinelike voice. “I’m 
in your power.” 



He staggered toward me like some kind of zombie. “Your typewriter 
controls me, Zackie. Your typewriter has the power! I am your slave!” 

“Adam—you’re not funny!” I cried. 

The girls giggled. They closed their eyes, stuck out their arms, and started 
marching toward me too. 

“We’re in your power,” Emmy chanted. 

“You’re controlling our every move,” Annie said. 

“This isn’t funny!” I shouted furiously. “Get lost, you guys! You—” 

I turned and saw Mrs. Jack bouncing toward us, her face as red as her 
lipstick. “What are you doing back here?” she bellowed. “This isn’t a 
clubhouse!” 

Adam and the girls instantly lowered their sleepwalker arms. Annie and 
Emmy backed up against the meat counter. 

“Are you buying anything?” Mrs. Jack demanded, huffing and puffing from 
her long journey from the cash register. “If you’re not buying anything, get out. 
Go to the playground.” 

“We’re going,” Adam murmured. He couldn’t get past Mrs. Jack. She filled 
the aisle. So he scooted down the next aisle. 

Annie and Emmy hurried after him. 

Mrs. Jack glared at me. 

“I—I’m almost finished,” I stammered. I picked up the basket. I searched 
for my list, but couldn’t find it. 

No problem. I remembered what was on it. 

I found the other items and dropped them into the basket. Mrs. Jack stayed 
with me the whole while. 

Then she walked me to the front of the store. 

I paid and hurried out. I was so angry at Adam and the girls, I forgot all 
about the candy bars. 

They are always making fun of me, I griped to myself. 

Always playing mean tricks. Always trying to make me look like a jerk. 

Always. Always. 

And I’m sick of it. I’m sick to death of it! 

“Sick sick sick!” I chanted the word all the way home. I hopped off my bike 
and let it crash to the driveway. Then I ran inside and tossed the grocery bag onto 
the kitchen counter. 

“Sick sick sick.” 



I’m going to totally lose it if I don’t cool down, I decided. 

I ran up to my room and shoved a fresh sheet of paper into the old 
typewriter. 

Then I plopped into the desk chair and furiously started typing. A third Blob 
Monster story. The scariest one of all. 

I typed as fast as I could. I didn’t think about it. I let my anger do the 
thinking. 

I didn’t write it out first. I didn’t plan it. I didn’t know what was going to 
happen next. 

I leaned over the old typewriter and typed. 

In the story, the ugly pink Blob Monster attacks the whole town. People are 
screaming. Running in every direction. Running for their lives. 

Two police officers step forward to fight the Blob Monster off. It opens its 
huge mouth—and swallows them whole! 

Shrieks of terror fill the town. The enormous Blob Monster is eating 
everyone alive! 

“Yes!” I cried out loud. “Yes!” 

I was paying everyone back. Paying the whole town back. 

“Yes!” 

It was the most exciting, most terrifying story I ever wrote. I wrote page 
after page. 

“Zackie—you forgot something!” a voice called. 

I started to type those words into the story. Then I recognized Mom’s voice. 

Breathing hard, I spun away from the typewriter. I found Mom leaning in 
the doorway, shaking her head fretfully. 

“You have to go back to the store,” she said. “You forgot the loaf of Italian 
bread. We need bread for dinner tonight.” 

“Oh. Sorry,” I replied. 

I glanced back at my story and sighed. It was going so well. I was having 
such a good time. 

I’ll get right back to it after I go to the store, I decided. 

I took more money from Mom. Then I picked up my bike from the 
driveway. 

I thought about my Blob Monster story as I pedaled to town. It’s the best 
story I ever wrote, I decided. 

I can’t wait to read it to Alex. 



I heard the thud of footsteps on the sidewalk. A man in a business suit came 
mnning by. A dark blur. He ran so fast, I couldn’t see his face. 

What’s his problem? I wondered. He’s too dressed up to be jogging! 

“Whoa!” I had to swerve to the curb as a blue station wagon roared toward 
me. The woman at the wheel honked her horn and waved frantically to me. Her 
tires squealed as she shot around the corner. 

“Everyone is in such a hurry today,” I muttered to myself. 

Then I heard a scream. A man’s scream. 

I pedaled faster. I was a block from town. I could see the awning over the 
doorway of Jack’s grocery on the corner. 

I saw two people running past the store. Running at top speed, waving their 
hands. 

I screeched to a halt when I heard another scream. 

“Look out!” someone shrieked. 

“Run! Call the police!” 

Two little kids ran past me. One of them was sobbing. 

“Hey—what’s going on?” I called to them. 

But they kept running. They didn’t answer. 

I started pedaling again, standing up. I leaned over my handlebars, trying to 
see what all the fuss was about. 

As I reached town, I saw people running down the center of the street. Cars 
honked. People were screaming. 

“Hey—what’s going on?” I called. “Is there a fire or something? Hey— 
somebody tell me what’s happening. Somebody—” 

And then I saw what was happening. 

And I opened my mouth in a shrill scream of horror—and fell off my bike. 



27 


“OW!” 

I landed hard on my right side. The bike slammed on top of me. The 
handlebar jabbed me in the neck. 

A man ran past. “Get away, kid!” he shouted. “Hurry! Get away!” 

I shoved the bike off me and climbed to my feet. 

My heart pounding in my chest, I brushed myself off. 

And gaped at the enormous, pink Blob Monster throbbing on the next 
corner. 

“Ohhh.” A horrified moan escaped my throat. 

It looks just as I described it in my story! I realized. 

Like a huge, slimy human heart. Pink and wet. With tiny black eyes. And 
purple veins knotted on top of its head. And a mouth cut into its belly. 

Throbbing. Throbbing... 

“It—it’s my monster!” I cried. 

Two little girls frowned at me as their mother tugged them away. I 
recognized her. Mrs. Willow, who lives across the street. 

“Zackie—run!” she cried, pulling each girl by a hand. “It’s a horrible 
monster!” 

“I know,” I murmured. 

She pulled her daughters across the street. But I didn’t follow them. 

I took a deep breath and made my way slowly down the street toward the 
throbbing Blob Monster. 

I wrote this, I realized. 

Just before I came to town, I typed this scene. I wrote that the Blob Monster 
attacked the town. 

And I’ll bet I know what happens next. 

As I stepped closer, I saw the trail of thick slime the monster left behind it. 
Its belly pulled open, and I saw its purple tongue darting from side to side. 

My legs trembled as I stepped even closer. 

People screamed and ran. Cars and vans roared past, horns honking. 

Everyone was running, desperate to escape. But I couldn’t leave. I couldn’t 



take my eyes off it. 

I made you! I thought. Horrified and curious and amazed—all at the same 

time. 

I created you! 

I wrote this story! 

The Blob Monster stared back at me through its tiny, black eyes. 

Did it know who I was? Did it know that I created it? 

As I stared in amazement, its mouth opened wider. It made sick, sucking 
sounds, and the purple tongue scraped the sides of its mouth. 

Thick, yellow drool poured out of the open mouth. 

And the Blob Monster bounced forward. 

Its purple tongue leaped out at me. 

“Hey—!” I cried out. I struggled to back away. 

The hot, sticky tongue wrapped around my leg. Started to pull me toward 
the slimy, open mouth. 

“Let go!” I tugged on the tongue as hard as I could. “Help me!” 

Two dark-uniformed police officers leaped in front of me. They had their 
nightsticks raised. 

With angry cries, they both began pounding the throbbing creature. 

POUND. POUND. POUND. 

The nightsticks made a soft plopping sound with each hit. 

The Blob Monster uttered a sickening gurgle. And its tongue slid off my 
leg. 

“Run!” one of the officers screamed. “Get going!” 

My legs were shaking so hard, I nearly fell. I could still feel the slimy, hot 
tongue on my leg. 

I stumbled back. 

And gaped in horror as the Blob Monster pulled open its mouth. The fat 
purple tongue swung around both police officers. 

They beat it with their sticks. They shoved it. They tried to wrestle free. 

But the tongue tightened, tightened around them—and pulled them. Pulled 
them into the huge, open mouth in the creature’s belly. 

Pulled them both inside. 

And then the mouth slammed shut with a disgusting SPLAT. 

“No! Noooooo!” I wailed. 

I wanted to pound my fists against the monster. Pound it until it melted to 



the ground. 

“It’s all my fault!” I screamed. 

I wrote that scene with the policemen. 

It was all in the story I had just typed. I wrote that the Blob Monster ate 
them both. 

And now it had come true! 

My frightening story had come true. Every scene of it. 

The Blob Monster uttered disgusting gulping sounds as it digested its 
human meal. Its tiny black eyes locked on mine as it gulped. 

What happens next? 

What happens next in my story? I asked myself. 

Trembling all over, my heart pounding, I struggled to think. 

What happens next? 

And then—with a shudder—I remembered what I had written. 

The Blob Monster follows me home! 



28 


The Blob Monster made a final gulp. Then it opened its mouth in a disgusting, 
gassy burp. 

Sickened by the sour odor, I staggered back. 

I’ve got to think of something, I told myself. I’ve got to stop this monster. 

Or it will eat me next. 

The Blob Monster began to slide forward, plopping wetly on the sidewalk 
as it moved. 

I knew I couldn’t stand there another second. I spun away and forced my 
mbbery legs to run. 

I picked up my bike off the street and jumped on. I began pedaling before I 
had my balance—and nearly crashed into a brick wall. 

I struggled frantically to turn myself around, to calm down enough to ride. 
Finally, I pedaled away, groaning with each thrust of my foot. 

I sped out of town. Halfway down the next block, I glanced back. 

Yes. Just as I had written. The Blob Monster was following me. Bouncing 
rapidly over the pavement. The purple veins on top of its head bouncing with it. 
Behind it, a trail of slime thickened on the street. 

It’s so fast! I realized. It’s keeping up with me! 

What happens next? What did I type next? 

“Oh, no!” I shrieked when I remembered. 

This is the part where I fall off my bike! 

“AIIIII! ” My front tire hit a rock—and I went flying over the handlebars. 

Once again, I hit the pavement hard. Once again, I shoved my bike off me 
and jumped to my feet. 

I turned to see the Blob Monster catching up. Plopping quickly up the 
street, its mouth gaping open, its tongue stretching... reaching out for me. 

I spun away—and ran into Alex and Adam. 

“Run! Don’t just stand there!” I screeched. “It—it’s catching up!” 

“Zackie—are you okay?” Alex asked. 

“No time for questions!” I gasped, shoving them both. “Run! The Blob 
Monster is real! I wrote it—and now it’s doing everything I wrote!” 



Adam laughed. He turned to the Blob Monster. “Do you think I’m stupid, 
Zackie? This is a joke—right? What is that? Some kind of a balloon?” 

“Adam—don’t!” I cried. 

I grabbed for him. And missed. 

He went running up to the Blob Monster. 

“Yeah. It’s some kind of big balloon!” Adam repeated, grinning. 

The monster’s purple tongue slid quickly around Adam’s waist. 

It pulled Adam easily into the open mouth. And then the Blob Monster 
swallowed him with a sickening gulp. 

Alex and I both screamed. 

Alex turned to me. “Did you write that?” she demanded in a trembling 
voice. 

I nodded. “Yes. It’s in my story,” I confessed. 

Alex grabbed my shoulder. “Well, what happens next? Tell me. What comes 
next?” 

“I—I don’t know,” I stammered. “That’s where I stopped writing!” 



29 


Alex and I never ran so fast in our lives. By the time we reached my house, my 
head was throbbing and my side was aching. 

We both gasped for breath as I pushed open the front door. “Anyone 
home?” I shouted into the house. “Mom? Mom?” 

No reply. She must have gone out. 

I turned and glimpsed the Blob Monster bouncing hard over Alex’s front 

yard. 

“No time!” I cried to Alex. “No time! Hurry!” 

She slipped inside the house, and I slammed the door behind us and locked 
it. Then I lurched toward my room, holding my aching side, forcing my rubbery 
legs to move. 

I mopped the sweat off my forehead with my arm. Then I dropped into the 
desk chair and raised my hands over the typewriter keys. 

Alex hurried up beside me. “What are you going to do?” she asked 
breathlessly. 

“No time to explain,” I choked out. 

I heard a thumping at the front door. Then I heard a loud CRAAAACK. 

And I knew the huge pink Blob had broken down the door. 

“No time. No time!” I declared. I furiously started to type. 

“I’m typing an ending,” I told Alex. “I’m going to type that the Blob 
Monster disappears. That it never existed. That Adam and the two policemen are 
okay.” 

SQUISSSSH... SQUISSSSH. 

Alex and I both gasped. We heard the Blob Monster’s slimy body, so close 
now, moving quickly toward us through the hall. 

I knew I had only a few seconds to type the ending. 

SQUISSSSSH. 

Right outside my bedroom door. 

I held my breath and pounded the keys. 

Pounded as hard and fast as I could until— 

“NOOOOO!” 



“What’s wrong?” Alex shrieked. 

“The keys are jammed!” 

We both screamed again as the Blob Monster bounced into the room. 



30 


The Blob Monster’s body heaved up and down. The creature panted, its entire 
body bouncing. White slime puddled on the floor around it. 

The slash of a mouth in the belly opened and closed, opened and closed. 
The purple tongue licked the mouth as the monster’s eyes narrowed on me. 

Alex gasped and backed up against the wall. “Zackie—type the ending!” 
she screamed breathlessly. “Make that thing disappear!” 

“I can’tl” I cried. I frantically pulled at the keys. “They’re jammed. I can’t 
untangle them!” 

“Zackie— please !” Alex pleaded. 

And then I saw the fat purple tongue leap. 

It rolled out of the Blob Monster’s open belly like a garden hose. 

“NOOOOOO!” I opened my mouth in a terrified wail as the tongue 
stretched across the room. Reached for me... 

Reached for me... 

No! 

The tongue wrapped around the typewriter. Lifted it easily. 

I grabbed for it with both hands. 

And missed. 

My hands slid across the tongue. So hot. Burning hot. And sticky. 

The tongue pulled back, snapped back like elastic. And carried the 
typewriter into the monster’s gaping mouth. 

As I stared in horror, the Blob Monster swallowed the typewriter with a 
single gulp. 

I leaped up from the desk chair. And stepped up beside Alex. We pressed 
our backs against the wall and watched helplessly as the Blob Monster throbbed 
and heaved. Digesting the typewriter. 

“We’re doomed,” Alex murmured. “The typewriter—it’s gone. Now there 
is no way you can destroy the monster.” 

“Wait!” I cried. “I have an idea!” 



31 


I dove back to the desk. I searched the desktop. 

“What are you doing?” Alex cried. 

The Blob Monster let out sick gurgling sounds as it digested the typewriter. 
Its body heaved up and down in the puddle of slime it had left on the rug. 

“The pen,” I told Alex. “The pen—” 

I pulled open the desk drawer and saw the old pen in front. I grabbed it and 
slammed the drawer shut. 

I held it up to show Alex. “The old pen the woman gave me. Maybe it has 
the same powers as the typewriter. Maybe I can write an ending with the pen— 
and make the Blob Monster disappear!” 

“Hurry—!” Alex warned. 

The Blob Monster had stopped its gurgling. The purple tongue came darting 
out again. 

I grabbed a sheet of paper and leaned over the desk. I pulled off the cap on 
the pen and lowered the point to the paper. 

“THE—” 

I wrote one word—and felt something hot and wet slap against the side of 
my face. 

The fat purple tongue slid against me. 

“Ow!” I cried out. And dropped the pen. 

My hand shot up to my cheek, and I felt hot, sticky slime. 

My stomach heaved. 

The tongue curled around the old pen. And carried it to the Blob Monster’s 
mouth. 

“Noooo!” Alex and I shrieked together. 

The creature sucked the pen into its open belly, and began its digesting 
gurgles. 

“Now what?” Alex asked in a whisper. “What can we do? It’s going to eat 
us next!” 

I jumped to my feet. The desk chair toppled over. 

I stepped away from it, my eyes on the doorway. “Make a run for it!” I 



cried. 

Alex held back. “We can’t,” she sighed. “That thing—it’s blocking the way. 
We’ll never get past it.” 

She was right. The Blob Monster would stick out its tongue and pull us 
easily into its drooling mouth. 

“Try the window!” I cried desperately. 

We both turned to the window. 

No way. It was bolted shut because of the air conditioner. 

“Doomed,” Alex whispered. “Doomed.” 

We both turned back to the throbbing, pink monster. 

And then I had one more idea. 

“Alex—remember when Adam typed something on my story? And it didn’t 
come true?” 

She nodded, keeping her eyes on the gurgling Blob Monster. “Yes, I 
remember. But so what?” 

“Well,” I continued, “maybe that’s because it’s me that has the power. 
Maybe the power isn’t in the typewriter or the pen. Maybe I got the power that 
night in that antique shop when I was zapped by that electrical shock.” 

Alex swallowed hard. “Maybe...” 

“Maybe it’s been in me the whole time!” I cried excitedly. “All I have to do 
is think what I want to happen—and it will come true. I don’t have to type it or 
write it. I just have to think it!” 

“Maybe...” Alex repeated. 

She started to say something else. But the Blob suddenly bounced forward, 
squishing over the rug. And its tongue rolled out toward us. 

“Ohhhh...” Alex backed up against the wall. 

The fat tongue licked her arm. It left a thick smear of sticky drool on her 

skin. 

“Think fast, Zackie!” Alex cried. 

The tongue curled and started to wrap itself around Alex. 

“Make it disappear!” Alex pleaded. “Think! Think it away!” 

I froze in horror as the fat tongue wrapped around Alex. It lifted her off the 
floor. 

Screaming, she thrashed her arms and kicked. Squirming frantically, she 
wrapped her hands around the sticky tongue—and shoved with all her strength. 

But the disgusting tongue squeezed tighter, held her in its slimy grip. 



I shut my eyes. 

Think! I instructed myself. Think hard! 

Think that the Blob Monster is gone. 

Gone... gone... gone. 

I held my breath. And thought with all my might. 
Would it work? 



32 


The monster is gone. 

That’s what I thought. 

The monster is gone... gone... gone... 

I silently chanted the word, over and over. Then I opened my eyes. 

And the Blob Monster was gone! 

Alex stood in the center of the floor, a dazed expression on her face. “It... it 
worked,” she choked out. 

I do have the power! I realized. 

I closed my eyes again and started to think. Adam is back, I thought. 

Adam is back... 

I opened my eyes—and Adam stood beside Alex. 

He blinked several times, then squinted at me. “What’s happening?” he 
asked. 

“I have it!” I cried happily. “I have the power—not the typewriter!” 

“What are you talking about?” Adam demanded. “What power?” 

I shook my head. “You wouldn’t understand,” I told him. 

Alex started to laugh. 

Before I realized it, I was laughing too. 

Joyful laughter. Relieved laughter. 

All three of us stood there, laughing, laughing, laughing—laughing happily 
ever after. 



33 


“Well? Did you like my story?” 

The pink Blob Monster neatened the pages he had just read and set them 
down on the desk. He turned to his friend, a green-skinned Blob Monster. 

“Did you just write that?” the green monster asked. 

The pink Blob Monster gurgled with pride. “Yes. Did you enjoy it?” 

“I did,” his friend replied. “Thank you for reading it to me. It’s very 
exciting. Very well written. What do you call it?” 

“I call it ‘Attack of the Humans’,” the Blob Monster replied. “Did you 
really like it?” 

“Yes. Those humans are really gross,” his friend replied. “Do you know my 
favorite part?” 

“What part?” 

“When the Blob Monster ate Adam. That was really fun!” the green 
creature declared. “But I have just one problem with your story.” 

The pink Blob Monster bobbed up and down. The veins on top of his head 
turned a darker purple. “A problem with my story? What is it?” 

“Well...” his green friend replied. “Why did you give it such an unhappy 
ending? I hated it when the human shut his eyes, and the Blob Monster 
disappeared. That was so sad.” 

“Do you think so?” the pink monster asked, gazing down thoughtfully at 
the pages he had written. 

“Yes,” his friend replied. “You should have a happy ending, instead. 
Everyone likes a happy ending.” 

The pink Blob Monster picked up his story. “Okay. You’re right. I’ll change 
the ending. I’ll have the Blob Monster eat them all!” 

“Great! I love it!” his friend declared. “Now, that’s a great ending!”

THE CURSE OF 
CAMP COLD LAKE 

Goosebumps - 56 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


I got off to a bad start at Camp Cold Lake. 

I was nervous when I arrived. And I guess I did some dumb things. 

Well, I didn’t want to go to a water sports camp. 

I don’t like to be outdoors. I hate the feeling of grass brushing against my 
ankles. I don’t even like to touch trees. And I certainly don’t like getting wet. 

Sure, I like to go swimming once in a while. But not every day! What’s the 
point of that? 

I like to swim in a nice, clean pool. I took one look at the lake here—and I 
was sick. I knew there had to be horrible things swimming around in that water. 

Ugly creatures, waiting below the surface. Thinking to themselves: “Sarah 
Maas, we’re waiting for you. Sarah, we’re going to rub our slimy bodies on your 
legs when you swim. And we’re going to chew off your toes, one by one.” 

Yuck. Why do I have to swim in slime ? 

Of course, Aaron was so excited, he nearly exploded. 

When we climbed off the camp bus, he was jumping up and down and 
talking a mile a minute. He was so crazed. I thought he was going to burst out of 
his clothes and go running into the lake! 

My brother likes camp. He likes sports and the outdoors. He likes just about 
everything and everyone. 

And everyone always likes Aaron. He’s so enthusiastic. He’s so much fun. 

Hey—I like to have fun too. But how can you have fun when there are no 
malls, no movie theaters, no restaurants to get a slice of pizza or a bag of french 
fries? 

How can you have fun up to your neck in a freezing cold lake every day? In 
a camp miles from any town? Surrounded on all sides by thick woods? 

“This is going to be awesome!” Aaron declared. Dragging his duffel bag, he 
hurried off to find his cabin. 

“Yeah. Awesome,” I muttered glumly. The bright sun was already making 
me sweat. 

Do I like to sweat? Of course not. 

So why did I come to Camp Cold Lake? I can answer that in three words: 
Mom and Dad. 



They said that a water sports camp would give me confidence. They said it 
would help make me more comfortable with the outdoors. 

And they said it would give me a chance to make new friends. 

Okay, I admit it. I don’t make friends easily. I’m not like Aaron. I can’t just 
walk up to someone and start talking and kidding around. 

I’m a little shy. Maybe it’s because I’m so much taller than everyone else. 
I’m a whole head taller than Aaron. And he’s only a year younger than I am. 
He’s eleven. 

I’m tall and very skinny. Sometimes Dad calls me “Grasshopper”. 

Guess how much I like that. 

About as much as I like swimming in a cold lake filled with hidden 
creatures. 

“Be a good sport about it, Sarah,” Mom said. 

I rolled my eyes. 

“Give camp a chance,” Dad added. “You might surprise yourself and have a 
good time.” 

I rolled my eyes again. 

“When you come home at the end of summer, you’ll probably beg us to 
take you camping!” Dad joked. 

I wanted to roll my eyes again—but they were getting tired from all that 
rolling. 

I gave my parents a glum sigh. Quick hugs. Then I followed Aaron onto the 
camp bus. 

He grinned the whole way to camp. He was really excited about learning 
how to water-ski. And he kept asking everyone if the camp had a high diving 
board over the lake. 

Aaron made three or four good friends on the bus ride to camp. 

I stared out the window, watching the endless blur of trees and farms. 
Thinking about my lucky friends who got to stay home and hang out at the mall. 

Then here we were at Camp Cold Lake. Kids pulling their bags off the bus. 
Laughing and joking. Counselors in dark green T-shirts greeting everyone, 
pointing them in the right direction. 

I began to cheer up a little bit. 

Maybe I will make some new friends, I thought. Maybe I’ll meet some kids 
who are a lot like me—and we’ll have a great summer. 

But then I stepped into my cabin. I saw my three bunk mates. I looked 



around. 

And I let out a cry. “Oh, no! No way!” 



2 


I guess I shouldn’t have freaked like that. 

It made a very bad first impression. 

But what was I supposed to do? 

There were two bunk beds in the cabin. The three other girls had already 
chosen their beds. There was only one bed left—right in front of the window. 

And the window had no screens. 

Which meant that my bed would be crawling with bugs. I took one glance 
—and I knew I’d be swatting mosquitoes every night for the whole summer. 

Besides, I can’t sleep in a top bunk. I toss and turn a lot at night. If I slept 
on top, I’d fall on my head. 

I had to sleep on the bottom. In the bed against the far wall, away from the 
open window. 

“I—I can’t do this!” I blurted out. 

My three bunk mates turned to look at me. One had blond hair pulled back 
in a ponytail. Near her was a short, chubby girl with long brown hair. In the 
bottom bunk against the wall, an African-American girl with long cornrows 
stared across the cabin at me. 

I guess they wanted to say hi and introduce themselves. But I didn’t give 
them a chance. 

“Someone has to trade beds with me!” I cried. I didn’t mean to sound so 
shrill. But I was really upset. 

Before they could answer, the cabin door swung open. A sandy-haired 
young guy in a dark green camp T-shirt poked his head in. 

“I’m Richard,” he said. “I’m the boss guy, the head dude. Everything okay 
in here?” 

“No!” I cried. 

I couldn’t stop myself. I was just so nervous and unhappy. “I can’t sleep in 
this bunk!” I told him. “I don’t want to be near the window. And I need to sleep 
on the bottom.” 

I could see that the other girls were shocked by my outburst. 

Richard turned to the girl who was sitting on the bottom bunk against the 
wall. “Briana, would you trade beds with—” 



“Sarah,” I told him. 

“Would you trade bunks with Sarah?” Richard asked Briana. 

She shook her head so hard, the beads in her cornrows rattled against each 
other. “I really don’t want to,” she said softly. 

She pointed to the chubby girl with long brown hair, who sat on a camp 
trunk. “Meg and I were bunk mates last year,” Briana told Richard. “And we 
kind of wanted to be together.” 

Meg nodded. She had a round, baby face. Squirrel cheeks out to here. And 
she wore blue and red braces on her teeth. 

“I can’t sleep in front of the window,” I insisted. “I really can’t. I hate 
bugs.” 

Richard stared hard at Briana. “How about it?” 

Briana groaned. “Oh... all right.” She made a face at me. 

“Thanks,” Richard said. I could see he was studying me. 

He probably thinks I’m a real troublemaker, I thought. 

Briana climbed off the bottom bunk. She dragged her duffel bag across the 
room to the bunk by the window. “It’s all yours,” she muttered. 

She didn’t say it in a friendly way. 

I felt bad. My bunk mates hate me already, I thought. 

Why do I always do that? Why do I always get nervous and start off on the 
wrong foot with people? 

Now I’ve got to try really hard to make them my friends, I decided. 

But a minute later, I did something horrible. 



3 


“Hey—thanks for trading bunks, Briana,” I said. “That was really nice of you.” 

She nodded but didn’t say anything. Meg pulled open her trunk and started 
shoving shorts and T-shirts into her dresser drawer. 

The third girl smiled at me. “Hi. I’m Janice,” she said. She had a raspy, 
hoarse voice. “Everyone calls me Jan.” 

Jan had a nice smile. She had her blond hair pulled back in a ponytail. She 
had dark blue eyes and red cheeks. She seemed to be blushing all the time. 

“Were you here last summer?” I asked her. 

She shook her head. “No. Briana and Meg were here. But this is my first 
summer. I went to tennis camp last year.” 

“I’ve never been to any kind of camp,” I confessed. “I—I guess I’m a little 
nervous.” 

“Are you a good swimmer?” Briana asked. 

I shrugged. “Pretty good, I guess. I don’t swim much. I don’t really like it.” 

Meg turned from her trunk. “You don’t like to swim, and you came to a 
water sports camp?” 

Briana and Jan laughed. 

I could feel my face grow hot. I didn’t want to tell them that my parents 
made me come to this camp. That just sounded too geeky. I didn’t know what to 
say. 

“I... uh... I like other things,” I stammered. 

“Oh—I love that swimsuit!” Briana declared. She pulled a bright yellow 
swimsuit from Meg’s trunk and held it up in front of her. “This is excellent!” 

Meg tugged it back. “Like it would really fit you!” she muttered, rolling her 
eyes. Her braces clicked when she talked. 

Meg looked a little like a bowling ball next to tall, graceful Briana. 

“Did you lose weight over the winter?” Briana asked her. “You look great. 
Really, Meg.” 

“I lost a little,” Meg replied. She sighed. “But I didn’t get any taller.” 

“I grew about a foot this year,” I chimed in. “I’m the tallest girl in my 
school. Everyone stares at me when I walk through the halls.” 

“Boo hoo,” Meg said sarcastically. “You’ve really got it tough. Would you 



rather be a shrimp like me?” 

“Well... not really,” I replied. 

Ooops. I realized I’d said the wrong thing. 

I saw a flash of hurt in Meg’s eyes. 

Why did I say that? I asked myself. 

Why do I keep putting my foot in my mouth? 

I picked up my backpack from where I had tossed it on the floor. I carried it 
to my bunk to unpack it. 

“Hey—that’s mine! Put it down!” Jan came rushing over to me. 

I glanced down at the backpack. “No. It’s mine,” I insisted. 

I started to unzip it—and it fell off the bed. 

A whole bunch of things fell out and clattered across the cabin floor. 

“Oh!” I cried out in surprise. The stuff wasn’t mine. 

I saw pill bottles. Medicine jars. And little plastic inhalers. 

“Asthma medicine?” I cried. 

Jan dropped to her knees and began gathering it all up. She glared up at me 
angrily. “Thanks a bunch, Sarah,” she growled. “Thanks for letting the whole 
world know I have asthma. Why don’t you stand up at the campfire tonight and 
announce it to the whole camp?” 

“Sorry,” I murmured weakly. 

“I told you it was my backpack,” Jan snapped. 

Meg bent down and picked up an inhaler for Jan. 

“Having asthma is nothing to be ashamed of,” she told Jan. 

“Maybe I like to keep some things to myself,” Jan snapped. She shoved all 
the medicine into the pocket and grabbed the backpack away. 

“Sorry,” I said again. “Really.” 

All three girls glared at me. Briana shook her head. Meg tsk-tsked. 

They hate me already, I thought. 

I felt sick. Really sick. 

They hate me, and it’s only the first day. The first hour. 

With a sigh, I slumped down on my bunk. 

Can things get any worse? I wondered. 

Guess the answer to that.

Later that night, we had our first campfire. It was built in a wide, flat clearing 
near the woods. Smooth logs were placed in a circle to be used as benches. 

I dropped down on an empty log with my back to the trees. Flames from the 
big fire danced brightly against the gray evening sky. 

The fire crackled and popped. It smelled so sweet. I took a deep breath. 

Counselors tossed more sticks on the fire. Soon the flames rose up over 
their heads. 

The night air was hot and dry. My cheeks burned from the heat tossed off 
by the fire. 

I turned away and gazed into the woods. The dark trees shivered in a light 
breeze. In the gray light, I saw a squirrel dart between tall weeds. 

I wondered what other animals lurked in the woods. I imagined there were 
bigger animals than squirrels in there. Bigger and more dangerous. 

A loud POP from the fire made me jump. 

It’s creepy outside at night, I thought. Why can’t they have the campfire 
indoors? In a fireplace or something. 

I slapped a mosquito on my neck. 

When I turned back to the fire, I saw Briana and Meg on another log bench. 
They were laughing about something. Talking to two girls I didn’t know. 

I saw Aaron on the other side of the flames. He was goofing with two other 
guys. They were wrestling around, trying to shove each other off the log. 

I sighed. Aaron has already made a bunch of friends, I thought. 

Everyone has made friends—but me. 

Aaron saw me staring at him. He waved quickly, then turned back to his 
friends. 

On the next log, three girls had their heads tossed back. They were loudly 
singing the camp song. 

I listened carefully, trying to learn the words. But they had a giggling fit 
halfway through and didn’t finish the song. 

Two older girls sat down on the other end of my log. They looked about 
fifteen or sixteen. I turned to say hi to them. But they were busy talking. 

One of them had a bag of Gummi Worms in her hand. She kept pulling 



them out of the bag one by one and slurping them slowly like spaghetti noodles. 

Richard, the head counselor, stepped in front of the fire. He had a black 
baseball cap turned backwards on his head. His baggy shorts were torn and dirty 
from working on the fire. 

He raised both hands over his head. “Are we all here?” he called out. 

I could barely hear him. Everyone was still talking and laughing. Across the 
fire, I saw Aaron standing up, wiggling his whole body in a funny dance. 

His friends were laughing their heads off. One of them slapped Aaron a 
high five. 

“Can we get started?” Richard called out. “Can we start our welcoming 
campfire?” 

A log cracked in the fire. Red embers shot up all around. 

“Oh!” I let out a cry as a hand grabbed my shoulder. 

“Who—?” I spun around, startled. And stared up at Briana and Meg. 

They leaned over me. In the darting firelight, I saw their frightened 
expressions. 

“Sarah—run!” Briana whispered. 

“Get up—quick!” Meg tugged my arm. “Run!” 

“Why? What’s wrong?” I sputtered. 



5 


I jumped shakily to my feet. “What’s wrong?” 

“Those boys,” Meg whispered. She pointed across the fire. “They threw 
fireworks in the fire! It’s going to explode!” 

“Run!” both girls cried. 

Meg gave me a shove to get me started. 

I stumbled—and then lurched forward. As I ran, I shut my eyes tight, 
expecting the blast any second. 

Could I get away in time? Were Meg and Briana escaping it too? 

I stopped short when I heard the laughter. 

Shrill, gleeful laughter. 

“Huh?” Swallowing hard, I turned back. 

And saw half the camp laughing at me. 

Meg and Briana slapped each other a high five. 

“No. Oh, noooo,” I murmured. How could I fall for such a dumb trick? 

How could they play such a mean joke on me? 

They must have told everyone to watch. As I stood at the edge of the 
clearing by myself, I could feel all the eyes on me. 

And I could hear kids laughing and making jokes. 

I saw Jan laughing. And I saw Richard and some of the other counselors 
grinning and shaking their heads. 

I know, I know. I should have laughed too. I should have made a joke of it. 

I shouldn’t have let it upset me. 

But the whole day had been so terrible. I was so nervous. And so eager not 
to make any more mistakes. 

I could feel my shoulders start to shake up and down. I could feel tears 
welling up in my eyes. 

No! I ordered myself. You cannot cry! You cannot allow yourself to cry in 
front of the whole camp. 

Sure, you feel like a total jerk, Sarah. But so what? It was just a joke. Just a 
dumb joke. 

I felt a hand on my arm. I pulled away. 



“Sarah—” Aaron stood beside me. His dark eyes were wide in the shadowy 
evening light. 

“I’m okay,” I snapped. “Go away.” 

“You’re such a bad sport,” he said softly. “Why can’t you ever let things 
slide off you? It was just a joke. Why go nuts over a dumb joke?” 

Do you know what I really hate? 

I really hate it when Aaron is right. 

I mean, he’s my younger brother—right? What right does he have to be the 
sensible, calm member of the Maas family? 

It really steams me when Aaron comes on like the older brother. 

“Do I need your advice?” I snarled. “Take a hike.” I gave him a shove 
toward the campfire. 

He shrugged and hurried back to his friends. 

I crept to the campfire. I didn’t go to my old seat. It was too close to the fire 
—and too close to Briana and Meg. 

I dropped down on the edge of a log near the woods, outside the glow of the 
fire. The darkness cooled me and helped to calm me down. 

Richard had been talking for a while. I realized I hadn’t heard a word he 

said. 

He stood in front of the crackling fire. He had a deep, booming voice. But 
everyone leaned in to hear him better. 

I gazed around the circle of campers. Their faces glowed orange in the 
bright firelight. Their eyes sparkled. 

I wondered if anyone here would be my friend. 

I knew I was feeling really sorry for myself. I wondered if any other new 
campers felt the way I did. 

Richard’s voice droned on in the back of my mind. He was saying 
something about the main lodge. Something about the meal schedule. Then he 
began talking about towels. 

I started to pay attention when he introduced the head waterfront counselor. 
Her name was Liz. 

Everyone clapped when she stood up beside Richard. One of the boys gave 
a loud wolf whistle. 

“She’s awesome!” another boy called out. 

Everyone laughed. 

Liz grinned too. She knew she looked really awesome. She wore tight 



denim cutoffs and a dark blue midriff top. She waved for everyone to get quiet. 

“Are you all having a good time?” she called out. 

Everyone cheered and clapped. Several boys whistled. 

“Well, tomorrow will be your first day at the waterfront,” Liz announced. 
“And before you go in the lake, there are lots of water rules we want you to 
know.” 

“Like, don’t drink the water!” Richard chimed in. “Unless you’re very 
thirsty!” 

Some kids laughed. I didn’t. The thought of drinking that disgusting, slimy 
water made me sick. 

Liz didn’t laugh, either. She frowned at Richard. “We need to take this 
seriously,” she scolded. 

“I was serious!” Richard joked. 

Liz ignored him. “When you get back to your bunks, you will find a list of 
water rules on your bed,” she continued, brushing back her long, frizzy red hair. 
“There are twenty rules on the list. And you need to know them all.” 

Huh? Twenty rules? I thought. How can there be twenty rules? 

It will take all summer to learn twenty rules. 

Liz held up a sheet of paper. “I’m going to go over the list with you now. If 
you have any questions, just call them out.” 

“Can we go swimming now?” a boy shouted, trying to be funny. 

Lots of kids laughed. 

But Liz didn’t crack a smile. “That’s rule number eight,” she replied. “No 
night swimming, even if counselors are with you.” 

“Don’t ever swim with counselors!” Richard joked. “They have germs!” 

Richard is pretty funny, I thought. He seems like a good guy. 

But Liz seems so serious. 

The sheet of paper fluttered in the wind. She gripped it with both hands. 
Her red hair caught the glow of the fire. 

“The most important rule at Camp Cold Lake is the Buddy System,” Liz 
announced. “When you are in the lake, you must always have a buddy.” 

She glanced quickly at the campers seated around her. “Even if you are only 
wading in up to your ankles, you must have a swimming buddy with you,” she 
said. “You may have a different buddy each time. Or you may choose a buddy 
for the whole summer. But you must always have a buddy.” 

She took a deep breath. “Are there any questions?” 



“Will you be my buddy?” a boy shouted. 

Everyone laughed. I laughed too. The kid’s timing was perfect. 

But once again, Liz didn’t crack a smile. “As waterfront counselor, I will 
act as everyone’s buddy,” she replied seriously. 

“Now, rule number two,” she continued. “Never swim more than three boat 
lengths from one of our safety boats. Rule number three—no shouting or 
pretending to be in trouble in the water. No horseplay. No kidding around. Rule 
number four...” 

She talked on and on, reading off all twenty rules. 

I groaned. She talks to us like we’re five year olds, I thought. 

And there are so many water rules. 

“Let me repeat one more time about the Buddy System...” Liz was saying. 

Gazing past the fire, I could see the dark lake. Smooth and black and silent. 

The lake has tiny waves. No current. No dangerous tides. 

So why are there so many rules? I wondered. 

What are they scared of? 



6 


Liz talked for at least half an hour. Richard kept cracking jokes, trying to make 
her laugh. But she never even smiled. 

She talked some more about every rule on the list. Then she told us to read 
the list carefully when we got back to our cabins. 

“Have a safe summer, everyone!” she called out. “See you at the 
waterfront!” 

Everyone cheered and whistled again as Liz stepped away from the fire. I 
yawned and stretched my hands over my head. That was really boring, I thought. 

Eve never heard of a place having so many rules. 

I swatted another mosquito on my neck. I was starting to feel really itchy. 
That’s what being outdoors does to me. It makes me itch like crazy. 

The fire had died down. A blanket of purple embers glowed on the dark 
ground. The night air grew cool. 

To end the campfire, Richard told everyone to stand and sing the camp 
song. “You new campers probably don’t know the words,” he said. “You’re 
lucky\” 

Everyone laughed. Then Richard began to sing, and everyone joined in. 

I tried to follow along. But I couldn’t catch all of the words. I picked up 
pieces of the song.... 

“Wetter is better ... ” 

“Get in the swim. 

Show your vigor and vim... ” 

“Every son and daughter 

should be in the water, 

the cold, cold water 

of Camp Cold Lake. ” 

Yuck. I agreed with Richard about the words to the song. They were so 
lame! 



Gazing across the fire, I saw Aaron singing his heart out. He seemed to 
know every word already. 

How does he do it? I wondered, scratching my itchy legs. How does he 
manage to be so perfect? To fit in everywhere? 

As the song ended, Richard raised his hands for quiet. “I have a few final 
announcements,” he called out. “First of all, none of you can carry a tune! 
Second...” 

I didn’t hear the rest. I turned to find Briana and Meg standing beside me. 

I took a step back. “What do you want?” I snapped. 

“We want to apologize,” Briana said. 

Meg nodded. “Yeah. We’re sorry we played that dumb joke on you.” 

Richard’s voice droned on behind us. Briana put a hand on my shoulder. 
“We got off to a bad start,” she said. “Let’s start all over again. Okay, Sarah?” 

“Yeah. Let’s start fresh,” Meg agreed. 

A smile spread over my face. “Great,” I said. “Excellent.” 

“Excellent!” Briana repeated, smiling too. 

She slapped me on the back. “A fresh start!” 

Richard was still making announcements. “Tomorrow at four-thirty, those 
interested in windsurfing...” 

Aaron will probably try that, I thought. I watched Briana and Meg walk 
away. 

A fresh start, I thought. I began to feel a lot happier. 

The happy feeling lasted for about two seconds. 

Then my back started to itch. 

I turned to the fire and saw Briana and Meg staring back at me. They were 
both giggling. 

Other kids had turned away from Richard and were watching me. 

“Ohhhh.” I groaned when I felt something warm wriggle against my back. 

Something warm and dry, moving under my T-shirt. 

“Ohhhh.” It moved again. 

I reached one hand back. And poked it under my shirt. 

What is it? What did Briana put back there? 

I grabbed the thing and pulled it out. 

And started to scream. 



7 


The snake wriggled in my hand. 

It looked like a long black shoelace. With eyes! And a mouth that kept 
snapping open and shut. 

“Noooooo!” I totally lost it. 

I let out a shrill scream. And I heaved the snake with all my might. 

It sailed into the woods. 

My back still itched like crazy. I could still feel it wriggling against my 

skin. 

I reached back and tried to scratch with both hands. 

Kids were laughing. Telling each other what Briana had done. 

I didn’t care. I just wanted to rub away the feeling of that snake against my 

skin. 

My whole body tingled. I uttered an angry cry. “How could you?” I 
shrieked at Briana and Meg. “What is your problem ?” 

Aaron came hurrying over to be the grown-up again. 

Just what I needed. Mr. Mature Kid Brother. 

“Sarah, did it bite you?” he asked softly. 

I shook my head. “I can still feel it!” I wailed. “Did you see it? It was three 
feet long!” 

“Calm down,” Aaron whispered. “Everyone is staring at you.” 

“Think I don’t know it?” I snapped. 

“Well, it was just a tiny snake,” Aaron said. “Totally harmless. Try to get 
yourself together.” 

“I—I—I—” I sputtered. I was too upset, too angry to talk. 

Aaron raised his eyes to Briana and Meg. “Why are those two girls picking 
on you?” he asked. 

“I don’t know!” I wailed. “Because... because they’re creeps ! That’s why!” 
“Well, try to calm down,” Aaron repeated. “Look at you, Sarah. You’re 
shaking all over.” 

“You’d shake too if you had a disgusting snake crawling up and down your 
skin!” I replied. “And I really don’t need your advice, Aaron. I really don’t—” 



“Fine,” he replied. He spun away and hurried back to his friends. 

“I don’t believe him,” I muttered. 

Dad is a doctor, and Aaron is just like him. He thinks he has to take care of 
everyone in the world. 

Well, I can take care of myself. I don’t need my little brother telling me to 
calm down every second. 

Richard was still talking. But I didn’t care. I stepped away from the 
campfire circle and started back to the cabin. 

The path curved through a patch of woods, up the sloping hill where the 
cabins were perched. Away from the glow of the fire, I was surrounded by 
darkness. 

I clicked on my flashlight and aimed the yellow circle of light at my feet. 
My sneakers crunched over dry leaves and twigs. The trees whispered above me. 

How did I get off to such a bad start? I asked myself. 

Why do Briana and Meg hate me so much? 

Maybe they’re just mean, I decided. Maybe they’re total creeps. Maybe 
they’re mean to everyone. 

They think they’re so hot because they were at camp last year. 

Without realizing it, I had wandered off the path. “Hey—” I swung the 
flashlight around, searching for the way back. 

The light swept over tilting trees, tall clumps of weeds, a fallen log. 

Panic tightened my throat. 

Where is the path? Where? 

I took a few steps. My sneaker crunched over leaves. 

And then my foot sank into something soft. 

Quicksand! 



8 


No. Not quicksand. 

There’s no such thing as quicksand. I remembered that from some science 
book I read in fifth grade. 

I lowered the flashlight. 

“Ohhhh.” Mud. Thick, gooey mud. 

My sneaker sank deep into the ooze. 

I pulled my leg up with a groan—and nearly toppled over backwards. 

It’s just mud, I told myself. It’s disgusting—but it’s no big deal. 

But then I saw the spiders. 

Dozens of them. The biggest spiders I ever saw. 

There must have been a nest of them in the mud. 

They were crawling over my shoe, crawling up the leg of my jeans. 

“Ohhhh. Yuck!” 

Dozens of spiders clung to me. I shook my sneaker. Hard. Then I began 
batting at them with my free hand. 

“I hate this caaaaaamp!” I screamed. 

I beat some spiders away with the flashlight. 

And then I had an idea. 

I mean, why shouldn’t I pay Briana and Meg back for what they did to me? 

They embarrassed me in front of the whole camp. And I hardly did 
anything to them. 

I emptied the batteries from the flashlight. I took a deep breath. Then I bent 
down—and scooped a bunch of spiders into the flashlight. 

Yuck. I felt sick. I really did. 

I mean, can you imagine —me handling spiders! 

But I knew it would be worth it. Soon. 

I filled the flashlight with the squirming, black creatures. Then I screwed on 
the top. 

I stepped over a fallen tree trunk. Found the path. And carrying the 
flashlight carefully, I eagerly hurried to the cabin. 

I stopped outside the door. The lights were on inside the cabin. 



I peeked in through the open window. No. No sign of anyone. 

I crept inside. 

I pulled up the blanket on Briana’s bed. Then I emptied half of the spiders 
onto her sheet. I carefully pulled the blanket over them and smoothed it out. 

I was pouring the rest of the spiders into Meg’s bed when I heard a 
shuffling noise behind me. Quickly, I pulled Meg’s blanket back into place and 
spun around. 

Jan stepped into the cabin. “What’s up?” she asked in her hoarse, croaky 
voice. 

“Nothing,” I replied, hiding the flashlight behind my back. 

Jan yawned. “It’s Lights Out in ten minutes,” she said. 

I glanced at Briana’s bunk. I’d left one corner of the blanket untucked. 
Briana won’t notice, I decided. 

I realized I was grinning. I quickly changed my expression. I didn’t want 
Jan asking a lot of questions. 

She turned and pulled a long white nightshirt from her dresser drawer. 
“What did you sign up for tomorrow?” she asked. “Free Swim?” 

“No. Canoeing,” I told her. 

I wanted to be in a nice, dry canoe. Not flopping around in the dirty lake 
with fish and other slimy creatures. 

“Hey. Me too,” Jan said. 

I started to ask if she would be my buddy. But Briana and Meg came 
strolling through the door. 

They saw me—and burst out laughing. 

“What was that wild dance you were doing at the campfire?” Briana teased. 

“You looked as if you had a snake down your back or something!” Meg 
declared. 

They laughed some more. 

That’s okay I thought. Go ahead and laugh. 

In a few minutes, when you climb under your covers, I’ll be laughing. 

I couldn’t wait. 



9 


A few minutes later, Jan turned out the lights. I lay on the hard mattress, staring 
up at Meg’s mattress above my head, grinning. Waiting... 

Waiting... 

Meg shifted her weight in the bunk above me. 

I heard her gasp. 

And then both Briana and Meg began to scream. 

I laughed out loud. I couldn’t hold it in. 

“It bit me! It bit me!” Briana howled. 

The lights flashed on. 

“Help!” Meg cried. She leaped out of bed. Her bare feet hit the floor hard. It 
sounded like an elephant landing. 

“It bit me!” Briana cried. 

She and Meg were both on the floor now, dancing and wriggling. Slapping 
at their arms, their legs, their backs. 

I bit my lip to make myself stop laughing. 

“Spiders! Spiders all over!” Meg shrieked. “Ow! It bit me too!” She pulled 
up the sleeve of her nightshirt. “Ow! That hurts!” 

Jan stood at the light switch. I hadn’t moved from my bed. I was enjoying it 
all too much. Watching them squirm and dance. 

But Jan’s words wiped the smile from my face. 

“Sarah put the spiders there,” she told Briana and Meg. “I saw her messing 
around at your bunks when I came in.” 

What a snitch. I guess she was still angry at me because I spilled her asthma 
medicine. 

Well, that put an end to the fun. 

I think Briana and Meg wanted to strangle me. They both had to go to the 
infirmary and wake up the camp nurse. They had to make sure the spider bites 
weren’t poisonous. 

How was I to know that these were the kind of spiders that bite? 

It was just a joke, after all. 

I tried to apologize when they came trudging back from the nurse. But they 



wouldn’t speak to me. And neither would Jan. 

Oh, well, I sighed. So they won’t be my friends. I’ll make other friends.... 

The next morning in the mess hall, I ate breakfast alone. The room had two long 
tables that stretched from wall to wall. One for boys and one for girls. 

I sat at the far end of the girls’ table and spooned up my cornflakes in 
silence. 

All the other girls were chattering away. At the other end of the table, 
Briana and Meg kept flashing me angry looks. 

I saw Aaron at the boys’ table. He and his friends were laughing and 
goofing on each other. Aaron balanced a pancake on his forehead. Another boy 
slapped it off. 

At least he ’s having fun, I thought bitterly. 

I had the sudden urge to go over and tell Aaron how unhappy I was. But I 
knew he would just tell me to lighten up. 

So I sat at my lonely end of the table and choked down my cornflakes. 

Did things get better when I arrived at the lake for canoeing? 

Three guesses. 

Kids were already pulling their canoes off the grassy shore, into the water. 
They all seemed to be paired up. 

Liz walked over to me. Her white one-piece bathing suit glowed in the 
morning sunlight. She had her frizzy red hair tied behind her head. 

She let a silver whistle fall from her mouth. “What’s your name?” she 
asked, eyes on the lake. 

“Sarah,” I told her. “I signed up for canoeing, but—” 

“You need a buddy,” she said. “Find a buddy. The canoes are over there.” 
She pointed, then trotted away. 

Canoes splashed into the water. The slap of the wooden paddles echoed 
around the shore. 

I ran to the stack of canoes, searching for a buddy. But everyone had 
already chosen partners. 

I was about to give up when I spotted Jan, pulling a canoe to the water. “Do 
you have a buddy?” I called. 

She shook her head. 

“Well, can I come with you?” I asked. 

“I don’t think so,” she replied nastily. “Do you have any more spiders you 



want to set loose?” 

“Jan, please—” I started. 

“Are you two together?” Liz appeared behind us, startling us both. 

“No. I—” Jan started. 

“I want to be her buddy, but she doesn’t want to,” I said. I didn’t mean to 
whine, but it came out that way. 

Jan made an ugly face at me. 

“Get your canoe in the water,” Liz ordered. “You two are the last ones in.” 

Jan started to protest. Then she shrugged and sighed. “Okay, Sarah. Let’s 

go-” 

We pulled on life preservers. Then I grabbed a paddle and one end of the 
canoe. We dragged it to the water. 

The little boat bobbed against the shore. The lake current was stronger than 
I thought. Low waves plopped steadily against the grassy shore. 

Jan climbed in and took a seat in the front. “Thanks for embarrassing me in 
front of Liz,” she muttered. 

“I didn’t mean—” I started. 

“Okay. Push off,” she commanded. 

I tossed my paddle into the canoe. Then I leaned over and gave the boat a 
hard shove with both hands. 

It slid smoothly away from the shore. Then I had to wade out to it and pull 
myself inside. 

“Whoa!” As I struggled to hoist myself up, the canoe nearly tipped over. 

“Watch it!” Jan snapped. “You’re such a klutz, Sarah.” 

“Sorry,” I murmured. I was so grateful to have a buddy, I didn’t want any 
more trouble between us. 

I pulled myself into the canoe and dropped down behind Jan. 

The canoe bobbed up and down as we began to paddle. The rocking waters 
sparkled like silver under the bright morning sunshine. 

It took us a while to find the right rhythm. 

Neither of us spoke. 

The slap of our paddles and the rush of water against the little canoe were 
the only sounds we made. 

The lake gleamed in front of us like a giant, round mirror. I could see 
several canoes up ahead. Jan and I were far behind them. 

The rubber life preservers were hot and heavy. We pulled them off and 



dropped them to the canoe floor. 

We paddled steadily, not too fast, not too slow. 

I glanced back. The shore seemed miles away. 

I felt a chill of fear. I’m not that strong a swimmer. I suddenly wondered if I 
could swim all the way to shore from out here. 

“Hey!” As I stared back at the shore, the canoe suddenly started to rock. 
“Whoooa!” I grabbed the sides. 

I turned—and to my horror, saw Jan standing up\ 

“Jan—stop! What are you doing?” I shrieked. “What are you doing?” 

The little boat rocked harder. I gripped the sides, struggling to steady it. 

Jan took a step. 

The canoe tilted. Water splashed over my feet. 

“Jan—stop!” I cried again. “Sit down! What are you doing?” 

She narrowed her eyes at me. “Bye, Sarah.”

The boat tilted more as she raised one foot to the side. She pulled off the T-shirt 
she had over her swimsuit and tossed it to the canoe floor. 

“No—please!” I begged. “Don’t leave me out here. I’m not a good 
swimmer. What if the boat tips over? I don’t think I can swim back from here!” 

“You ruined my summer,” she accused. “Now everyone knows I have 
asthma. So they won’t let me go on the six-day canoe trip.” 

“But—but it was an accident—” I sputtered. 

“And you’re messing up everything for Briana and Meg too,” Jan said 
angrily. 

“No. Wait—” I started. “I apologized to them. I didn’t mean—” 

She shifted her weight. 

Tilted the canoe the other way. 

Then she shifted her weight again. Again. 

Deliberately making the canoe rock. 

Deliberately trying to frighten me. 

“Don’t tip it over, Jan. Please—” I pleaded. 

She tilted it more. Made it rock so hard, I thought I’d tumble out. 

“I’m really not a good swimmer,” I repeated. “I really don’t think I—” 

She uttered a disgusted groan. Then she tossed back her hair. Raised her 
arms over her head. Bent her knees. Kicked off hard. 

And dove into the lake. 

“Noooo!” I let out a cry as the boat rocked violently. Jan’s dive sent up a 
tall, foamy wave of water. 

The canoe tilted... rocked... 

...and flipped over! 

I hit with a smack. Cold water rose up around me as I sank. 

Frozen in shock. 

I felt the canoe bounce above me on the surface. 

Then I started to choke as water invaded my nose and mouth. 

Sputtering and gagging, I thrashed my arms and legs. 

Pushed myself... pushed... pushed myself to the surface. 



And raised my head over the bobbing current. 

Still sputtering, I sucked in a deep breath of fresh air. Then another. 

Floating on the surface, I saw the canoe bobbing upside down on the water. 

I struggled to catch my breath, to slow my racing heart. 

Then I swam to the canoe. I grabbed on to it. Wrapped one arm around it. 
Held on for dear life. 

Bobbing with the canoe, I squinted into the sunlight, searching for Jan. 

“Jan? Jan?” I called to her. 

“Jan? Where are you?” 

I turned and searched in all directions. 

A feeling of cold dread tightened my chest. 

“Jan? Jan? Can you hear me?” I shouted. 



11 


I held on to the canoe with one hand and shielded my eyes with the other. “Jan? 
Jan?” I shouted her name as loudly as I could. 

And then I spotted her. 

I saw her blond hair glowing in the bright sunlight. And I saw her red 
swimsuit. Her arms moving steadily, smoothly. Her feet kicking up foamy 
waves. 

She was making her way to shore. 

She swam away and left me here, I realized. 

I turned and searched for the other canoes. Squinting against the sun, I 
could see them far ahead of me. Too far away to hear my shouts. 

Maybe I can turn the canoe over, I decided. Then I can climb in and paddle 
back to shore. 

But where were the paddles? 

I raised my eyes to the camp—and saw Jan talking to Liz. She was waving 
her arms frantically and pointing out to the water. Pointing to me. 

A crowd of kids gathered around them. I could hear excited voices. Shouts 
and cries. 

I saw Liz pull a canoe into the water. 

She’s coming to rescue me, I realized. Jan must have told her I couldn’t 
swim all the way back. 

I suddenly felt embarrassed. I knew all the kids on shore were watching me. 
I knew they were talking about what a wimp I must be. 

But I didn’t care. I just wanted to get back on dry land. 

It didn’t take Liz long to paddle out to me. When I pulled myself into the 
canoe, I started to thank her. 

But she didn’t let me get a word out. “Why did you do it, Sarah?” she 
demanded. 

“Excuse me?” I gasped. “Do what?” 

“Why did you tip the canoe over?” Liz asked. 

I opened my mouth to protest—but only a squeak came out. 

Liz frowned at me. “Jan says you deliberately tipped over the canoe. Don’t 
you know how dangerous that is, Sarah?” 



“But—but—but—!” 

“I’m calling a special camp meeting because of this,” Liz said. “Water 
safety is so important. The water safety rules must be followed at all times. 
Camp Cold Lake couldn’t exist if campers didn’t follow every rule.” 

“I wish it didn’t exist,” I muttered unhappily. 


* * * 


So Liz held a long meeting at the lodge. And everyone at camp had to be there. 

She went over the rules of water safety again. Rule by rule. 

And then she showed an endless slide show about the Buddy System. 

I sat way on the side and stared down at the floor. But every time I raised 
my eyes, I saw Briana, Meg, and Jan glaring angrily at me. 

Other campers kept staring at me too. I guess they all blamed me for this 
long, boring meeting. Jan probably told everyone in camp that I was the one who 
tipped over the canoe. 

“I want you to memorize all twenty water safety rules,” Liz was saying. 

More campers stared angrily at me. 

Everyone hates me, I thought, shaking my head sadly. And there is nothing 
I can do about it. 

Then, suddenly, I had an idea. 



12 


“I’m going to run away,” I told Aaron. 

“Good-bye,” he said calmly. “Good luck.” 

“No. Really!” I insisted. “I’m not kidding. I’m really going to run away 
from this camp.” 

“Send me a postcard,” Aaron said. 

I had dragged him away from the mess hall after dinner. I really needed to 
talk to him. I pulled him to the edge of the lake. 

No one else was down here. Everyone was still at the mess hall in the 
lodge. 

I glanced at the canoes, stacked in piles of three near the water. I pictured 
Jan’s blond hair, her red swimsuit. I pictured her swimming away, leaving me in 
the middle of the lake. 

And then lying to Liz. Getting me in trouble.... 

I shook Aaron by the shoulders. “Why won’t you take me seriously?” I 
cried through clenched teeth. 

He laughed. 

“You shouldn’t shake a person after they’ve just eaten the camp meat loaf.” 
He let out a loud burp. 

“You’re so gross.” I groaned. 

He grinned. “It’s a family tradition.” 

“Stop joking around. I mean it,” I snapped. “I’m really unhappy, Aaron. I 
hate this camp. There is no phone here we can use. I can’t call Mom and Dad. So 
I’m going to run away.” 

His expression changed. He saw that I was serious. 

He skipped a flat stone across the water. I watched the ripples spread out, 
then disappear. 

The lake reflected the gray evening sky. Everything was gray. The ground, 
the sky, the water. Reflections of trees shimmered darkly in the gray water. 

“Where are you going to run?” Aaron asked softly. I could see him quickly 
becoming the mature, “wiser” brother again. But I didn’t care. 

I had to tell him my plan. I couldn’t leave camp without letting him know. 

“Through the woods,” I said. I pointed. “There is a town on the other side 



of the woods. When I get to the town, I’m going to call Mom and Dad and tell 
them to come get me.” 

“You can’t!” Aaron protested. 

I stuck my chin out. “Why not?” 

“We’re not allowed in the woods,” he replied. “Richard said the woods 
were dangerous—remember?” 

I shoved Aaron again. I was so tense, so angry, I didn’t know what to do 
with my hands. 

“I don’t care what Richard said!” I bellowed. “I’m running away— 
remember?” 

“Give the camp a chance, Sarah,” Aaron urged. “We haven’t even been here 
a whole week. Give the place a chance.” 

That’s when I totally lost it. 

“I hate it when you’re so sensible!” I screamed. 

I shoved him hard. With both hands. 

His mouth flew open. He lost his balance—and toppled into the lake. 

He landed on his back in the wet mud just past the shore. 

“Ooof!” I heard the air shoot out of him. 

“Sorry—” I started. “It was an accident, Aaron. I—” 

He scrambled to his feet, pulling up greasy gunk and seaweed with him. 
Shaking his fists. Calling me all kinds of names. 

I sighed. Now even my brother was furious at me. 

What am I going to do? I asked myself. What can I do? 

As I trudged back to the cabin, another plan began to form in my mind. 

A really desperate plan. 

A really dangerous plan. 

“Tomorrow,” I murmured to myself, “I’m going to show them all!” 



13 


I thought about my plan all the next morning. I was frightened—but I knew I had 
to go through with it. 

Our group had Free Swim that afternoon. Of course, everyone had a buddy 
but me. 

I dug my bare feet into the muddy shore and watched everyone pair up and 
head into the water. Puffy white clouds floated overhead, reflected in the nearly 
still water. 

Tiny gnats jumped over the surface of the water. I stared at them, 
wondering why they didn’t get wet. 

“Sarah, it’s swim time,” Liz called. She hurried over to me. She wore a pink 
one-piece bathing suit under crisp white tennis shorts. 

I adjusted my swimsuit top. My hands were trembling. 

I really was scared by what I planned to do. 

“Why aren’t you swimming?” Liz demanded. She brushed a fly off my 
shoulder. 

“I—I don’t have a buddy,” I stammered. 

She glanced around, trying to find someone for me. But everyone was in 
the lake. 

“Well...” Liz twisted her mouth fretfully. “Go ahead and swim by yourself. 
Stay close to the shore. And I’ll keep an eye on you.” 

“Great. Thanks,” I said. I smiled at her, then trotted enthusiastically to the 
edge of the water. 

I didn’t want her to guess that it wasn’t going to be a normal swim for me. 
That I had something really terrible in mind.... 

I stepped into the water. 

Oooh. So cold. 

A cloud rolled over the sun. The sky darkened, and the air grew colder. 

My feet sank into the muddy bottom of the lake. Up ahead, I saw the gnats 
—hundreds of them—hopping on the water. 

Yuck, I thought. Why do I have to swim with mud and gnats? 

I took a deep breath and stepped out farther. When the cold water was 
nearly up to my waist, I lowered my body in and started to swim. 



I swam a few long laps. I needed to get used to the water. And I needed to 
get my breathing steady. 

A short distance away, Briana and some other girls were having some kind 
of relay race. They were laughing and cheering. Having a great time. 

They won’t be laughing in a few minutes. I told myself bitterly. 

A tall spray of water rushed over me. I cried out. 

Another wave smacked my face. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that I was being splashed—by Aaron. 

He rose up in front of me—and spit a stream of water into my face. 

“Yuck! How can you put this water in your mouth?” I cried, totally grossed 
out. 

He laughed and splashed away to join his buddy. 

He won’t be laughing in a few minutes, either, I told myself. He’ll treat me 
differently after today. 

Everyone will. 

I suddenly felt guilty. I should have told Aaron what I planned to do. I 
didn’t really want to scare him. I wanted to scare everyone else. 

But I knew if I told my plan to practical, sensible Aaron, he would talk me 
out of it. Or go tell Liz so that she would stop me. 

Well... no one is going to stop me, I vowed. 

Have you guessed my desperate plan? 

It was really quite simple. 

I planned to drown myself. 

Well... not really. 

I planned to dive down to the lake bottom. Stay under. A long, long time. 
And make everyone think that I had drowned. 

I can hold my breath for a very long time. It’s because I play the flute. I’ve 
really developed my lung power. 

I can probably stay underwater for two or three minutes. 

Long enough to scare everyone to death. 

Everyone will panic. Even Briana, Meg, and Jan. 

Everyone will feel sorry for how mean they were to me. 

I’ll get a new start. After my close call in the lake, everyone in camp will 
want to be nice to me. 

Everyone will want to be my buddy. 

So... here goes. 



I took one last look at all the laughing, shouting swimmers. 
Then I sucked in the biggest breath I had ever taken. 

And plunged down, down to the bottom of the lake. 



14 


The lake was shallow for only a few feet. Then the lake bottom gave way in a 
steep drop. 

I kicked hard, pushing myself away from the other swimmers. Then I pulled 
myself upright, lowering my feet. 

Yes. 

I dropped my hands to my sides and let myself sink. 

Down, down. 

I opened my eyes as I dropped to the lake bottom. I saw only green. Waves 
of pale light shimmered through the green. 

I’m floating inside an emerald, I thought. Floating down, down in a 
sparkling green jewel. 

I pictured the tiny emerald on the ring Mom wore every day. Her 
engagement ring. I thought about Mom and Dad, thought how sad they’d be if I 
really did drown. 

We never should have sent Sarah to that water sports camp, they would say. 

My feet hit the soft lake floor. 

A bubble of air escaped my mouth. I pressed my lips tighter, holding the air 
inside. 

I slowly floated up toward the surface. 

I closed my eyes. I kept my whole body still to make it look as if I’d 
drowned. 

I pictured the horror on Liz’s face when she saw my body floating so still, 
floating under the water, my hair bobbing on the surface. 

I almost laughed when I thought of Liz leaping into the lake to rescue me, 
having to get her crisp white tennis shorts wet, I forced myself to remain still. 

I shut my eyes even tighter. And thought about Briana, Meg, and Jan. 

They’ll feel so guilty They’ll never forgive themselves for the way they 
treated me. 

After my close call, they’ll see how mean they were. And they’ll want to be 
best friends with me. 

We’ll all be best friends. 

And we’ll have a great summer together. 



My chest began to feel tight. The back of my throat began to burn. 

I opened my lips and let out a few more bubbles of air. 

But my throat still burned, and so did my chest. 

I floated facedown. I kept my legs stiff and let my arms hang loosely at my 
sides. 

I listened for shouts of alarm. 

Someone must have spotted me by now. 

I listened for cries of help. For kids calling Liz. 

But I heard only silence. The heavy silence you hear when you’re 
underwater. 

I let out another bubble of air. 

My chest really hurt now. It felt about to explode. 

I opened my eyes. Was anyone nearby? Was anyone coming to rescue me? 

I saw only green. 

Where is everyone? I wondered. 

Liz must have spotted me by now. Why isn’t she pulling me up out of the 
water? 

I pictured her again in her white tennis shorts. I pictured her tanned arms 
and legs. I pictured her red hair. 

Liz—where are you? 

Liz—don’t you see me drowning here? You said you’d keep an eye on me, 
remember? 

I can’t stay under much longer. 

My chest is ready to explode. My whole body is tingling. Burning. My head 
feels about to pop open. 

Can’t anyone see me here ? 

A wave of dizziness swept over me. 

I shut my eyes, but the dizziness didn’t go away. 

I pushed out the rest of the air in my lungs. 

No air, I thought. No air left.... 

My arms and legs ached. 

My chest burned. 

With my eyes closed, I saw bright yellow spots. 

Dancing yellow lights. They grew brighter... brighter. They did a fast, 
furious dance all around me. 



Around my burning, tingling body. 

My chest... exploding... exploding... 

I’m so cold, I realized. Suddenly, I feel so cold. 

The dancing, darting yellow lights grew brighter. Bright as spotlights. 
Bright as flashbulbs, flashing in my eyes. 

Flashing around my still, cold body. 

I shuddered from the cold. 

Shuddered again. 

Cold, thick water filled my mouth. 

I’ve stayed under too long, I realized. 

No one is coming. No one is coming to save me. 

Too long... too long. 

I struggled to see. But the lights were too bright. 

Can’t see. Can’t see. 

I swallowed another mouthful of water. 

Can’t see. Can’t breathe. 

I can’t stay under any longer. I can’t wait any longer. 

I struggled to raise my head out of the water. But it felt so heavy. It weighed 
a ton. 

Can’t stay down... 

Can’t breathe. 

With a burst of strength, I moved my shoulders. Pulled them up. 

Hoisted up my head. 

So heavy... so heavy. My hair filled with water. My hair so heavy. The 
water running down my face. 

Over my eyes. 

I turned to shore. Squinted through the bright, darting lights. 

Squinted hard through the water running down my face. 

Squinted... 

No one there. 

I turned again. My eyes searched the water. 

No one there. No one swimming. No one on the shore. 

Where is everyone ? I wondered. Shivering. Shuddering. 

Where did everyone go? 



15 


I struggled to shore. 

My feet were numb. I couldn’t feel the muddy bottom as I staggered out of 
the water. 

I rubbed my arms. I couldn’t feel the touch of my hands. Couldn’t feel the 
water pouring off me, running down my back. 

Couldn’t feel anything. Numb. Numb all over. 

“Where is everyone?” I called. 

But did I make a sound? Did I have a voice? 

I couldn’t hear myself. 

I stepped onto the grass and shook myself. Like a dog trying to get dry. 
Trying to shake some feeling into my cold, numb body. 

“Where did you all go?” 

Hugging myself, I stumbled forward. I stopped when I saw the canoes. All 
tacked upside down by the shore and tied up. 

Weren’t kids canoeing today? Weren’t the canoes all out in the lake? 

“Hey!” I shouted. 

But why couldn’t I hear my shout? 

“Where is everyone?” 

No one on the shore. 

I spun around, nearly losing my balance. No one in the water. 

No one. No one anywhere. 

I stumbled past the life preservers and rubber rafts. Covered with a canvas 

tarp. 

Isn’t anyone going to use them? I wondered. Why are they covered up? 

Why did everyone leave the lake so quickly? 

Shivering, hugging myself, I made my way toward the lodge. I gasped 
when I noticed the trees. 

Bare. All winter bare. 

“Noooooooo!” a frightened wail escaped my throat. A silent wail. 

Could anyone hear me? 

When had the leaves fallen? Why had they fallen in the middle of summer? 



I started to trot along the path to the lodge. Cold. So cold. 

Something stung my shoulder. Something tingled my eyelids. 

Snow? 

Yes. Tiny white flakes drifted down, blown by a steady breeze. The bare 
trees rattled and creaked. 

I brushed snowflakes from my wet hair. 

Snow? 

But I knew that was impossible. 

All impossible. 

“Heeeeeeey!” My shout echoed through the trees. Or did it? 

Could anyone hear my frightened call? 

“Hellllllllllp!” I shouted. “Somebody hellllllp me!” 

Silence, except for the creaking tree limbs overhead. 

I started to run again. My bare feet moved silently over the cold ground. 

The cabins came into view as I made my way out of the trees. Their flat 
roofs were covered by a thin layer of snow. 

The ground was as gray as the sky. The cabins were all dark, the shingled 
walls gray. Gray all around me. 

A cold world of gray. 

I pushed open the door of the first cabin I came to. “Hey—I need help!” I 
cried. 

I stared into the empty room. 

No one there. No camp trunks. No clothes scattered about. 

I raised my eyes to the bunk beds against the wall. The blankets, the sheets 
—the mattresses—had all been taken away. 

I guess this cabin isn’t being used, I thought. 

I backed out of the door. Turned and ran down the row of cabins. All dark 
and silent. 

My cabin stood where the path curved up the hill. With a sigh of relief, I ran 
up to it and pushed open the door. 

“Briana? Meg?” 

Empty. And dark. 

The mattresses gone. The posters pulled down. No clothes. No bags or 
trunks. 

No sign that anyone had ever lived in here. 

“Where are you?” I shrieked. 



And then, “Where am I?” 

Where was my stuff? Where was my bed? 

Uttering another terrified wail, I lurched out of the cabin. 

Cold. So cold and numb. Running through the cold in my wet bathing suit. 

I tore through the camp. Pulling open doors. Peering into bare, empty 
rooms. Calling. Calling for someone—anyone—to help me. 

Into the main lodge. My cries echoing off the high, wooden rafters. 

Or did they? Was I really making a sound? 

Why couldn’t I hear myself? 

I burst into the mess hall. The long, wooden benches had been stacked on 
top of the tables. The kitchen stood dark and empty. 

What has happened? I wondered, unable to stop my trembling. 

Where did everyone go? Why did they all leave? How did they leave so 
quickly? How can it be snowing? 

I stumbled back out into the gray cold. Wisps of gray fog floated low over 
the gray ground. I hugged my frozen body, trying to warm myself. 

Terrified and confused, I wandered from building to building. I felt as if I 
were swimming again. Swimming in the thick gray mists. Swimming through 
endless layers of gray. 

And then I stopped when I heard a voice. 

A tiny voice. A girl’s voice. 

Singing. 

She was singing in a high, frail voice. 

“I’m not alone!” I cried. 

I listened to her song. A sad song sung so softly. 

And then I called out to her, “Where are you? I can’t see you! Where are 
you?” 



16 


I followed the tiny voice to the lodge. I saw a girl perched on the wooden steps. 

“Hey!” I called. “Hey! I was looking for someone! Can you help me?” 

She kept singing, as if she didn’t see me. As I walked closer, I realized she 
was singing the Camp Cold Lake song in her tiny, light voice. 

She had long curls of white-blond hair that flowed down the sides of her 
face. A pretty face, delicate and pale. So incredibly pale. 

She wore a sleeveless white T-shirt and white short shorts. Snowflakes fell 
all around us. I shivered. But she didn’t seem to notice the cold. 

She tilted her head from side to side as she sang. Her round blue eyes stared 
out at the sky. They reminded me of shiny blue marbles in her pale, pale face. 

I stepped up in front of her. I brushed snowflakes from my forehead. 

She didn’t turn to me until her song was finished. Then she smiled. “Hi, 
Sarah.” Her speaking voice was as soft as her singing. 

“How—how do you know my name?” I stammered. 

Her smile grew wider. “I’ve been waiting for you,” she replied. “My name 
is Della.” 

“Della—I’m so cold,” I blurted out. 

She rose to her feet. Turned. And pulled something out from behind the 
steps. 

A white bathrobe. 

She held it up and slipped it around my trembling shoulders. 

Her hands were so light. I could barely feel them. 

She helped me tie the belt. Then she stepped back and smiled at me again. 
“I’ve been waiting for you, Sarah,” she said. Her voice was a sigh, a whisper. 

“Excuse me?” I cried. “Waiting—?” 

She nodded. Her white-blond hair fluttered with every move of her head. “I 
can’t leave without you, Sarah. I need a buddy.” 

I stared at her, trying to understand. 

“Where is everyone?” I cried. “Where did everyone go? Why are you the 
only one here?” I bmshed snowflakes from my eyebrows. “Della, how did it get 
to be winter?” 



“You’ll be my buddy—won’t you, Sarah?” Her blue eyes burned into mine. 
Her hair glowed around her pale face. 

I blinked. “I don’t understand—” I started. “Please answer my questions.” 
“You’ll be my buddy, won’t you?” she repeated, pleading with those 
amazing eyes. “I’ve waited so long for a buddy, Sarah. So long.” 

“But, Della—” 

She started to sing again. 

I shoved my hands into the pockets of the robe. I shivered. I couldn’t get 
warm. I couldn’t stop shaking. 

Why was she singing the Camp Cold Lake song so sadly? 

Why wouldn’t she answer my questions? 

How did she know my name? And why did she say she’d been waiting for 

me? 

“Della, please—” I begged. 

Singing her strange, sad song, she floated up the wooden stairs to the lodge. 
Her hair shimmered, golden in the gray light. Swirls of fog curled around her as 
she moved. 

“Oh!” I cried out when I realized I could see right through her. 

“Della—?” 

She floated over the stairs, tilting her head from side to side, singing in that 
breathy whisper of a voice. 

“Della—?” 

She stopped singing and smiled at me again. Snowflakes covered her blond 
hair. The fog still swirled around her. 

I could see the dark shingles of the lodge through her body. I stared right 
through her. 

“Sarah, you’re my buddy now,” she whispered. “I need a buddy. Everyone 
at Camp Cold Lake needs a buddy.” 

“But—but you ’re dead\” I blurted out. 

Della is dead, I realized. 

And I’m her buddy. 

That means... 

That means that I’m dead tool 



17 


Della floated over me. So light and pale. The wind fluttered her hair. It rose 
around her like a shimmering halo. 

“You’re dead,” I murmured. “And I am too.” 

Saying the words sent a cold shudder down my body. 

I began to realize the truth. I began to see what had happened. 

Della had probably drowned here. Drowned in the lake. 

That is why everyone at the camp is so crazy about water safety. 

That explains the endless water safety lectures. And the long list of rules. 
And why the counselors insist on the Buddy System at ah times. 

Della drowned here. 

And now I’m her buddy. 

I’m her buddy—because I drowned too. 

“Noooooooooo!” Along wail of horror, of disbelief, escaped my throat. 

I threw my head back and wailed like an animal. Wailed out my sorrow. 

Della floated over me, watching me. Waiting for me to stop. She knew what 
I was thinking. She knew I had figured everything out. 

She waited patiently. How long had she been waiting there for me? Waiting 
for a buddy? Another dead buddy? 

How long had she been waiting for another unlucky girl to drown? 

“Noooo!” I moaned. “No, I won’t do it, Della! I can’t do it! I won’t be your 
buddy! I won’t!” 

I spun around. So dizzy, I nearly dropped to my knees. 

I started to run. The white robe flew open. It flapped beside me like wings 
as I ran away from her. 

Ran barefoot over the snowy ground. 

Ran through the swirls of fog. Through the gray. 

“Come back, Sarah!” I heard Della call to me. “Come back! You have to be 
my buddy! I’m trapped here. Trapped as a ghost. I can’t leave this camp—I can’t 
get to the other world—without a buddy!” 

But I didn’t stop. I kept running through the camp. Past the cabins. Past the 
supply sheds at the edge of the woods. 



I kept running from her calls. Running from her ghostly voice. 

I don’t want to be her buddy, I told myself. I don’t want to be a ghost ! 

I blinked away snowflakes as I ran. Ran through the bare, creaking trees. 
Ran without looking back. 

I stopped when I reached the lake shore. Stopped when I felt the cold water 
lap over my feet. 

The cold, gray water. 

I struggled to catch my breath. But my chest hurt. Felt about to explode. 
Gasping, I turned—and saw Della floating through the trees. Floating 
toward me, her eyes glowing with blue fire. 

“You can’t leave without me, Sarah!” she called. “You can’t leave, Sarah!” 

I turned away from her. Turned back to the water. 

My chest. My head. 

Everything hurt so much. 

I couldn’t breathe. 

My chest was going to burst. 

I sank to the mud. 

As the gray faded to black. 



18 


Pinpricks of white light danced above me. 

I thought of fireflies, darting above the grass late at night. 

The tiny lights grew brighter. Round, like flashlight beams. 

Brighter still. 

Until I was staring into a glowing ball of gold. 

I blinked. 

It took me a long while to realize that I was staring up at the sun. 

I turned my head away. 

I suddenly felt heavy. I could feel the ground beneath me. I could feel the 
weight of my body on the ground. 

My body. My solid body, coming back to me. 

I heard a groan. Someone moved above me. 

I blinked several times. And squinted up at Liz. 

Her face was red. Her mouth was twisted in a hard scowl. 

“Ohhh.” I groaned as she pressed both hands on my chest. Raised her 
hands. Pressed again. 

I felt water slide from my open mouth. 

I choked. Felt more water pour down my chin. 

“She’s coming around,” Liz announced. She pressed hard on my chest 
again. “She’s alive!” Liz cried. 

Behind her, I could see bare legs. Swimsuits. Campers. 

Yes. The other campers. 

I groaned again. Liz continued to work over me. 

I’m lying on my back, I realized. I’m on the lake shore. Liz is giving me 
CPR. 

The other campers are standing around me. Watching. Watching Liz save 
my life. 

“I’m—ALIVE!” The word burst from my throat. 

I sat up. And gazed around. 

Everyone is back! I realized. It’s summer again. The leaves are back on the 
trees. The sun is beaming down. 



And everyone is back. Including me! 

Liz uttered a sigh and sank back on her knees. “Sarah, are you okay?” she 
asked breathlessly. She mopped sweat from her forehead with the back of her 
hand. “Are you okay?” 

“I... I think so,” I murmured. 

I had a sour taste in my mouth. I still felt a little dizzy. 

Behind Liz, some campers cheered and applauded. 

“We thought you were gone for a moment.” Liz sighed. “You stopped 
breathing. What a scare!” 

Two counselors helped me to my feet. I tried to shake off my dizziness. 
“I’m okay!” I cried. “Thank you, Liz. You—you saved my life!” 

I hugged Liz. Then I turned and hugged Aaron. 

Briana and Meg were standing nearby. I startled them by hugging them too. 

I was so happy to be alive! So happy to be away from that gray, gray winter. 
Away from that frightening ghost girl in the empty camp. 

“Sarah—what happened?” Liz asked, placing a hand on my still-wet 
shoulder. She gently brushed back my hair. 

“I’m not sure,” I told her. “I’m really not sure.” 

Liz shuddered. “When you stopped breathing, I... I got so scared.” 

“I’m fine now,” I told her with a smile. “Thanks to you.” 

“She did it for attention,” I heard someone mutter. 

I turned—and saw Jan whispering to another girl. “Now everyone has to 
say ‘Poor Sarah’,” Jan whispered nastily. “Now everyone has to be nice to her.” 

I felt hurt. I opened my mouth to say something to Jan. 

But I was so happy to be back, so happy to be alive, I just ignored it. 

I rested a hand on Aaron’s shoulder and let him walk me back to my cabin. 
“I’m going to enjoy the rest of camp,” I told my brother. “I really am.” 

The nurse checked me out carefully. Then I rested all afternoon. I took a long 
nap. 

When I woke up, I was starving. I realized I hadn’t eaten all day. 

I pulled on jeans and a camp sweatshirt and hurried to the campfire. As I 
trotted down the path toward the clearing by the woods, the aroma of hot dogs 
and hamburgers on the barbecue drifted out to me. 

Richard greeted me at the campfire circle. “Sarah, you look great!” he 
exclaimed. “I heard about... what happened at the lake this afternoon.” 



“Well, I’m fine now,” I told him. “I feel great.” 

“Hey—no more close calls,” he scolded. “Or else you have to swim in the 
kiddie pool.” 

“I’ll be careful,” I promised. 

“You’d better—because we don’t have a kiddie pool!” he joked. 

I laughed. 

“Take a seat,” he said, pointing to the circle of logs. “Take a seat, 
everyone!” he called out. “We’re going to have a meeting before we eat!” 

Most of the campers had already taken their places. I glanced around the 
circle quickly, searching for a place to sit. 

“Sarah—?” A voice called to me. 

“Sarah—over here.” 

I let out a shocked cry when I saw Della. 

Della. By herself on a log back near the woods. Her blond hair shimmering 
around her pale face. The pink evening sunlight shining through her body. 

Shining right through her. 

“Noooo!” I moaned. 

“Come over here, Sarah!” Della called. “Please—sit over here with me. Be 
my buddy!” 



19 


I raised my hands to my cheeks and let out a shrill scream. 

“No! You’re not here!” I wailed. “You’re a ghost! You don’t belong here! 
I’m alive now! I’m alive!” 

I turned and saw Richard and Liz hurrying toward me. 

Across the circle, Aaron jumped up and came running over. “Sarah—what’s 
wrong? What is it?” he cried. 

“Don’t you see her?” I shrieked. I pointed to the log near the woods. “She’s 
a ghost! But I’m alive!” 

Liz wrapped her arms around me. “It’s okay, Sarah,” she whispered. 
“You’re okay now.” 

“But—but she’s sitting there!” I sputtered. 

Everyone turned to the log. 

“There’s no one there,” Richard said. He narrowed his eyes at me. 

“You had a terrible shock,” Liz said softly. “A terrible shock. You’re still 
not quite yourself, Sarah.” 

“But—but—” I stammered. 

I saw Briana, Meg, and Jan huddled together, talking softly. Watching me. 

What are they saying about me? I wondered. 

“Do you want me to walk you back to your cabin?” Richard asked. 

I shook my head. “No. I’m starving!” 

Liz laughed. “Maybe that’s your problem. You’re so hungry, you’re seeing 
things! Let’s get you a hot dog—fast.” 

After a couple of hot dogs, I started to feel better. The campfire meeting 
began. I sat next to some girls from a different cabin. 

As Richard talked, I gazed around the circle. Stared at the campers’ faces, 
orange from the flickering campfire. Searching for Della. 

Della the ghost... 

Was she still here? Still watching me? Still waiting for me to be her buddy? 

I sat forward tensely. My whole body stiff. My eyes straining to see her 
pale, pale face. 

But she had vanished. 



For now. 

Liz took over the meeting. Most campers groaned when she started another 
lecture on water safety. 

“We had a close call today,” Liz said. “A frightening close call.” 

I knew everyone was staring at me. I could feel my face growing hot. I 
gazed into the yellow flames of the campfire. 

When I raised my eyes, I saw Briana, Meg, and Jan on the next log, 
whispering together. About me? 

“Our water safety rules are so important here at Camp Cold Lake,” Liz was 
saying. “Some campers joke that having so many rules is the curse of Camp 
Cold Lake, because we talk about the rules so much.” 

She pressed her hands against her sides. Her eyes moved from camper to 
camper. “But as we saw this afternoon,” she continued, “the Buddy System isn’t 
a curse—it’s a blessing.” 

A face rose up behind the darting flames of the fire. 

I gasped. 

Della! 

No. A girl from another cabin, climbing up to get more food. 

I sank back. 

I have to get away from this camp, I decided. I can’t have a good time here. 
Not if I always have to keep an eye out for Della. 

Liz rattled on about the water rules. 

Richard made a few announcements. 

Everyone sang some camp songs. 

When the campfire ended, I jumped up quickly and started along the path to 
my cabin. I had gone only a few steps when I heard fast footsteps behind me. 
And heard someone calling my name. 

Was it the ghost? 

I turned to see Aaron jogging up to me. “What was that screaming about?” 
he demanded. “Did you really think you saw a ghost?” 

“Why should I tell you?” I snapped. I continued along the path, walking 
rapidly. “You’ll only laugh at me.” 

“Try me,” he replied, running to catch up. “I won’t laugh. I promise.” 

“I saw a ghost girl,” I told him. “I swear I did. She called to me. She wants 
me to be her buddy.” 

Aaron laughed. “No. Really,” he said. “What did you really see? Be 



serious.” 

“I am serious!” I cried. “I have to get away from here, Aaron. I’m going to 
mn away. Get to a phone. Call Mom and Dad. Tonight. I’m going to tell them to 
come get me.” 

“You can’t!” Aaron replied. He grabbed my arm and forced me to stop 
walking. I could see kids staring at us as they walked past. 

“Mom and Dad won’t want to make more than one trip up here. So if you 
call them, they’ll make me come home too,” Aaron protested. “And I don’t want 
to leave. I’m having a great time!” 

“You don’t understand,” I told him. “I can’t stay here. I can’t—” 

“Please, Sarah,” he begged. “Try to stick it out. Give it a little more time. 
You’re just a little messed up because of the lake this afternoon. But you’ll be 
okay. Give it some time.” 

I didn’t say yes, and I didn’t say no. 

I just told Aaron good-night and headed to my cabin. 

I stopped outside the door. All the lights were on. I heard Briana, Meg, and 
Jan talking softly. 

They stopped talking as soon as I stepped inside. 

All three of them stared hard at me. Their expressions were tense. They 
moved quickly. 

Moved toward me as I started across the room. 

They formed a circle around me. Surrounded me. 

“What is it?” I cried. “What are you going to do?” 



20 


“We want to apologize,” Briana said. 

“We’ve been kind of rough on you,” Jan added in her scratchy voice. 
“We’re really sorry.” 

“We’ve been talking about it,” Briana said. “We—” 

“We decided we’ve been really unfair,” Meg interrupted. “We’re sorry, 
Sarah.” 

“I—I’m sorry too,” I stammered. I was so stunned by their apologies, I 
could barely speak. 

“Let’s start all over,” Briana suggested. She grabbed my hand. “Nice to 
meet you, Sarah. My name is Briana.” 

“Excellent. Afresh start!” Jan declared. 

“Thanks. I’m really glad,” I told them. And I meant it. 

Jan turned to Briana. “When did you do that to your nails?” 

Briana grinned and raised both hands. Her fingernails were a shiny, bright 
purple. “It’s a new color,” she said. “I did it after our swim.” 

“What color is it?” Meg asked. 

“Grape Juice, I think,” Briana replied. “They all have such crazy names.” 
She dug the bottle of nail polish from her pack and held it out to me. “Want to 
try it?” 

“Well... sure,” I replied. 

All four of us stayed up far past Lights Out, making our fingernails purple. 

Later, I lay in my bunk, drifting off to sleep. I had a smile on my face, 
thinking about my three bunk mates. My three friends. 

They had really cheered me up. 

But my smile faded when I heard a whispered voice float across the dark 
cabin. “Sarah... Sarah...” 

I gasped. 

And then the frail voice—soft as the wind—was so close... so close to my 

“Sarah. I thought you were my buddy, Sarah. Why did you leave me?” 

“No—please—” I begged. 


ear. 



“Sarah, I waited so long for you,” the ghostly voice whispered. “Come with 
me. Come with me, Sarah....” 

And then an icy hand gripped my shoulder. 



21 


“Ohhhhh!” 

I bolted up in the bunk. And stared out at Briana’s dark eyes. 

She let go of my shoulder. “Sarah,” she whispered. “You were whimpering 
in your sleep.” 

“Huh? What?” My voice quivered. My heart pounded. I realized I was 
drenched in sweat. 

“You were whimpering in your sleep,” Briana repeated. “Crying and 
moaning. I thought I’d better wake you.” 

“Uh... thanks,” I choked out. “Must have been a bad dream, I guess.” 

Briana nodded and crept back to her bunk. 

I didn’t move. I sat there trembling, staring out across the dark cabin. 

A bad dream? 

I didn’t think so.... 

“You can skip the long-distance swim today if you want,” Liz told me at 
breakfast the next morning. She leaned over my chair as I downed my 
cornflakes. I could smell the toothpaste on her breath. 

“Well...” I hesitated. “How long is the swim?” 

“We’re swimming halfway across the lake,” Liz replied. “Halfway out, then 
back. I’ll be in a boat at the halfway point. It isn’t really that far. But if you feel 
like skipping it today...” 

I set down my spoon. I could see Meg and Briana watching me from across 
the table. Beside me, Jan was struggling to choke down a half-toasted, frozen 
waffle. 

“Come on. Swim with us,” Briana urged. 

“I’ll be your buddy,” Jan said. “I’ll swim with you, Sarah.” 

Our frightening canoe adventure flashed into my mind. Once again, I 
pictured that horrible moment when Jan jumped from the canoe. Tipping it over. 
Leaving me there. 

But things were different now. 

We were friends. All four of us were friends now. I had to forget about what 
happened with the canoe. I had to forget about our bad start. 



“Okay,” I agreed. “Thanks, Jan. I’ll be your buddy.” I turned back to Liz. 
“I’m ready to swim.” 

The morning sun still floated low in the sky. It kept fading behind broad, gray 
clouds. And each time the sun disappeared, the air became as cold as the water. 

The lake was so cold in the early morning! 

As I waded in, I suddenly realized why it was named “Cold Lake”. 

We all stepped carefully into the water, shivering and complaining. The 
water lapped over my ankles, stinging them. I stopped with a gasp and waited to 
get used to the cold. 

I raised my eyes at the sound of a motorboat and saw Liz chugging to her 
place in the middle of the lake. When she reached the spot, she cut the engine. 
Then she picked up an electric megaphone. 

“Warm up first, everyone!” she instructed us. 

We all laughed. “Warm up? How are we supposed to warm up? It’s 
freezing!” 

Two girls near the shore began splashing each other. 

“Stop it! Whoooa! It’s collldV’ one of them shrieked. 

Taking another few steps over the soft lake bottom, I adjusted the top of my 
blue swimsuit. “We need wet suits,” I told Jan. 

She nodded, then waded out until the water lapped at her waist. “Come on, 
Sarah. Stick together.” She motioned for me to follow. 

I took a deep breath—and plunged into the water. 

A shock of cold swept over my body. But I dove under the water and swam 
out a few strokes. Then I raised my head and turned back to Jan. 

“Show off,” she muttered. She dipped her hands in the water, still 
struggling to get used to the cold. 

I laughed. “It’s refreshing!” I exclaimed, brushing my wet hair back. “Come 
on—just push off. It isn’t that bad.” 

Jan lowered herself into the water. Most of the swimmers were in the water 
now, moving in circles, floating on their backs, treading water. 

“Line up, everyone!” Liz instructed from her boat. Her voice through the 
megaphone echoed off the trees behind us. “Line up. Two at a time. Let’s go!” 

It took a while for everyone to get in place. Jan and I were second in line. 

I watched the first two girls begin to swim. One of them moved with 
smooth, steady strokes. The other one splashed and thrashed. 



Everyone cheered them on. 

Jan and I gave them about a two-minute head start. Then we began to swim. 

I tried to copy the first girl’s rhythmic stroke. I didn’t want to look like a 
klutz. I knew all the other swimmers were watching. But let’s get real. I’m not 
exactly headed for the Olympics. 

Jan pulled ahead easily. As we swam, she kept turning back to make sure I 
was keeping up with her. 

The turnaround spot was just past Liz’s motor-boat. I kept my eyes on it as I 
followed Jan through the water. It seemed very far away! 

Jan picked up speed. My arms started aching about halfway to the boat. 

I’m in bad shape, I told myself. I’ve really got to start working out or 
something. 

Liz’s boat bobbed gently up ahead of us. Liz was shouting something into 
the megaphone. But the splash of the water kept me from making out the words. 

Up ahead of me, Jan picked up the pace. 

“Hey—slow down!” I called. But there was no way she could hear me. 

Ignoring the aching in my arms, I struggled to catch up to her. I kicked my 
legs harder, splashing up water behind me. 

The sun dipped once again behind a high cloud. The sky darkened, and the 
water seemed to chill. 

Liz’s boat rocked in the water, just up ahead. I kept my eyes on Jan. 
Watched her steady kicks. Her hair bobbing on the lake surface like some kind of 
sea creature. 

When Jan turns back, I’ll turn back, I decided. 

I swam a little faster. Let’s turn, I pleaded silently. Jan, we’re here. We’re 
even with Liz’s motorboat. I’m ready to turn back now. 

But to my surprise, Jan kept stroking, kept swimming straight ahead. Her 
head ducked under the water. Her arms moved easily, gracefully, pulling her 
farther ahead of me. 

“Jan—?” 

My arms ached. My chest started to burn. 

“Hey, Jan—can we turn now?” 

She swam steadily ahead. 

With a burst of energy, I pulled myself forward. “Jan, wait—” I called. 
“We’re supposed to head back!” 

She stopped stroking. 



Did she hear me? 

Breathing hard, my chest burning, I swam up to her. 

She turned to face me. 

“Jan—■?” I gasped. 

No. Not Jan. 

It wasn’t Jan. It was Della! 

Her blue eyes sparkled as a gleeful smile spread over her pale, pale face. 
“Keep swimming, Sarah,” she whispered. “We’re going to swim farther. 
And farther. You’re my buddy now.” 



22 


She grabbed my arm. 

I tried to tug away. My wet arm slid in her grasp. 

But her grip tightened around my wrist. And she held on. Pulling me. 
Pulling me with her. 

“Owww!” 

She was strong. So strong for such a frail-looking girl. 

Such a frail-looking ghost ... 

“Let go!” I shrieked. 

I struggled, slapping the water. Kicking. Squirming and twisting. 

“Della—I won’t come with you!” 

I jerked my body around, spun hard—and broke free. 

And dropped beneath the surface. Lifting both arms, I rose up, coughing 
and sputtering. 

Where was she? 

Where? 

Was she right behind me? Ready to pull me with her, pull me out so far I 
couldn’t swim back? 

I spun away. The water rocked and tilted. 

The clouds overhead appeared to roar past. 

“Sarah... Sarah...?” Was she calling to me? 

Why couldn’t I see her now? 

I turned again. My eyes stopped on the boat. 

Yes. The boat. 

Ignoring my racing heartbeats, my aching arms, I plunged forward. 

The boat... got to reach the boat before she grabs me again. 

Swimming furiously, kicking with my last bit of strength, I dove for the 
boat. Stretching my arms out... stretching... 

And grabbed the side with both hands. Choking and gasping. 

Grabbed the side of the boat and tried to pull myself in. 

“Liz—help me.” The words escaped my throat in a hoarse whisper. 

“Liz—help me in.” 



The sun burst out from behind the clouds. I stared up into blinding golden 

light. 

“Liz—please...” 

Hands reached down for me. She bent to pull me into the motorboat. 

Leaned forward. Pulling me up. 

Blinking against the bright sunlight, I raised my eyes to her face. 

No! 

Not Liz’s face. Not Liz! 

Della! 

Della—pulling me into the boat. “What’s wrong, Sarah?” she whispered. 
Pulling me. Pulling me up to her. “Sarah, you’re okay. You’re perfectly okay.” 



23 


“Let go!” I wailed. 

I tore myself from her grip. 

And tried to blink away the sun. 

And stared up at Liz. 

Not Della. Liz. Her face twisted in concern. 

“Sarah, you’re okay,” she repeated. 

“But—” I stared up at her. Waiting for her face to change again. Waiting for 
her to become Della again. 

Had I only imagined Della’s face? Had the streaming sunlight tricked my 
eyes? 

With a sigh, I let her help me into the boat. 

I slumped to my knees. The boat rocked up and down. Liz narrowed her 
eyes at me. “What happened out there?” she asked. 

Before I could answer, I heard splashing outside the boat. 

Della? 

I froze. 

No. Jan pulled herself up on the side. She brushed her wet hair off her face. 
“Sarah—didn’t you hear me calling you?” she demanded. 

“Jan. I didn’t see you. I thought that—” My voice caught in my throat. 

“Why did you swim away from me?” Jan asked. “I’m your buddy— 
remember?” 

Liz drove me to shore. I changed my clothes and went to see Richard. I found 
him in his head counselor’s office, a little room about the size of a closet in the 
back of the main lodge. 

He was resting his feet on top of his tiny desk. He twirled a toothpick in his 
mouth. 

“Hey, Sarah—how’s it going?” He flashed me a friendly smile and 
motioned for me to take a seat in the folding chair across from his desk. 

I could see his eyes studying me. 

“I hear you had another little problem in the lake,” he said softly. He moved 



the toothpick to the other side of his mouth. “What’s going on?” 

I took a deep breath. 

Should I tell him there is a ghost girl who has been following me 
everywhere? Who wants me to be her buddy? 

He’d just think I’m nuts, I decided. 

“You had a bad shock yesterday,” Richard said. “We really thought that you 
drowned.” 

He lowered his feet and leaned over the desk toward me. “Maybe you went 
back in the water too soon,” he said. “Too soon after the shock.” 

“Maybe,” I murmured. 

And then I blurted out the question that was really on my mind. “Richard, 
tell me about the girl who drowned here.” 

His mouth dropped open. “Huh?” The toothpick fell onto his lap. 

“I know that a girl drowned in the lake,” I insisted. “Can you tell me about 
her?” 

Richard shook his head. “No girl ever drowned at Camp Cold Lake,” he 
said. “Never.” 

I knew he was lying. 

I had proof, after all. I had seen Della. And talked with her. 

“Richard, please—” I begged. “I really need to know. Tell me about her.” 

He frowned. “Why don’t you believe me, Sarah? I’m telling the truth. No 
campers have ever drowned at this camp. No boys. No girls.” 

I heard a soft sigh behind me. 

I glanced back at the open doorway—and saw Della standing there. 

I jumped to my feet. And pointed. “Richard!” I cried. “The girl who 
drowned! She’s standing right there! Don’t you see her?” 

Richard raised his eyes to the doorway. “Yes,” he replied softly. “I see her.” 



24 


“Huh?” I gasped and grabbed the edge of his desk. “You see her?” I cried. “You 
really do?” 

Richard nodded. He had a solemn expression on his face. “If it makes you 
feel better, Sarah, I’ll say that I see her.” 

“But you don’t really see her?” I demanded. 

He scratched his sandy-colored hair. “No. I don’t see anything.” 

I turned back to the doorway. Della grinned at me. 

“Sit down. Please,” Richard instructed. “You know, sometimes our mind 
plays tricks on us. Especially when we’ve been through a really bad scare.” 

I didn’t sit down. I stood in front of his desk and stared hard at Della. Stared 
right through her. 

“She’s not in my mind! She’s right there!” I shouted. “She’s standing right 
there, Richard. Her name is Della. She drowned at this camp. And now she’s 
trying to drown me too!” 

“Sarah—please calm down,” Richard said gently. He climbed around his 
desk and put a hand on my shoulder. Then he led me to the door. 

I was standing face-to-face with Della. 

She stuck out her tongue at me. 

“See? There’s no one there,” Richard said. 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

“Why don’t you stay away from the lake for a few days,” he suggested. 
“You know. Just hang out and relax.” 

Della mouthed his words as he spoke. 

I turned away from her. 

She giggled. 

“Don’t go to the lake?” I asked Richard. 

He nodded. “Take a few days and rest up. You’ll feel much better.” 

I knew I wouldn’t feel better. I knew I’d still have Della following me 
everywhere, trying to make me her buddy. 

I sighed. “That won’t help,” I told him. 

“Then I have a different idea,” he said. “Pick a sport you haven’t tried, 



Sarah. Pick something really hard. Like water-skiing.” 

“I don’t get it,” I replied. “Why should I do that?” 

“Because you will have to think so hard about what you’re doing, you 
won’t have time to worry about ghosts.” 

I rolled my eyes. “Yeah. Right.” 

“I’m trying to help you,” he said sharply. 

“Well... thanks,” I replied. I didn’t know what else to say. “I guess I’ll go to 
lunch now.” 

I trudged out of the tiny office. And took a deep breath. The air was much 
cooler out in the main lodge. 

I turned the corner and headed toward the mess hall in the front of the 
building. As I turned another corner, I heard Della’s frail voice behind me. 

“You can’t get away, Sarah. You’re my buddy. There’s no need to run. 
You’ll always be my buddy.” 

The soft words—so close to my ear—sent shivers down my back. 

Something inside me snapped. 

I couldn’t hold in my fury. 

“SHUT UP!” I shrieked. “SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP—AND 
LEAVE ME ALONE!” 

I spun around to see if she had heard me. 

And gasped in horror. 



25 


Briana stood behind me. 

Her mouth dropped open in shock. “Okay, okay. I’ll go away,” she said, 
backing up. “You don’t have to be so nasty, Sarah. I was just coming to see how 
you were doing.” 

Wow. I felt so bad. 

Briana thought I was talking to her. 

“I—I—” I stammered. 

“I thought you wanted to be friends,” Briana snapped. “I didn’t even say a 
word to you. And you bit my head off!” 

“I wasn’t talking to you!” I finally choked out. “I was talking to her!” 

I pointed to Della, who leaned against the wall behind us. Della waved to 
me and giggled. 

Sun from the open lodge window lit up Della’s blond hair from behind. I 
could see the window right through her body. 

“I was talking to her!” I repeated. 

Briana raised her eyes to the window. 

And the strangest expression spread over her face. 

The next morning, I gulped down some gooey scrambled eggs for breakfast. 
Then I made my way to the boat dock. 

Don’t ask why I decided to try water-skiing. 

I really don’t have an answer. 

I suppose I did it for Aaron. The night before, he begged me once again not 
to call Mom and Dad. 

Aaron really didn’t want to go home. He said he was having the best 
summer of his life. 

Sure, I thought. It’s easy for you to have a good summer. You don’t have a 
ghost following you around. 

“Please try to stay a while longer,” Aaron begged. 

I won’t go to the lake, I decided. I’ll hang around the cabin and read or 
something. 



But in the morning, I realized that was a bad plan. 

I’d be too scared to stay by myself in the cabin while everyone else was at 
the lake. I would have no way to protect myself against Della. 

Yes, I know I wasn’t thinking clearly. 

I was so stressed out, I could barely think at all! 

I should have stayed as far away from the water as possible. 

But I really didn’t want to be alone. So I followed Richard’s advice. And 
went to the boat dock. And told Liz I wanted to try water-skiing. 

“That’s great, Sarah!” Liz cried, flashing me a pleased smile. “Have you 
ever done it before? It’s easier than it looks.” 

I told her I’d never tried it. 

She pulled a yellow inflated life vest and a pair of skis from the equipment 

shed. 

Then she gave me a short lesson. Showed me how to lean back and how to 
bend my knees. 

A short while later, I was in the water waiting for the motorboat to come 
around. Meg was using the boat now, skiing behind it, sliding over the water. 
Her orange bathing suit glowed in the morning sunlight. 

The hum of the boat echoed over the water. The lake bobbed and rippled in 
the boat’s wake. 

Meg let out a cry and let go of the towrope as the boat sped near the dock. 
She splashed into the water, then quickly pulled off her skis. Then she came 
walking to shore. 

“My turn next,” I said softly. I felt a knot in my stomach. 

Meg flashed me a thumbs-up. 

I struggled with the skis, but finally got them in place. Then I pulled up the 
towrope, gripping it tightly in both hands. 

The boat motor sputtered and coughed. The boat rocked up ahead of me in 
the rippling blue water. 

I steadied myself. Lowered myself the way Liz had shown me. And took a 
deep breath. 

“Ready!” I called. 

The motor sputtered—and then roared. 

The boat pulled away so fast, the towrope nearly flew out of my hands. 

“Whooooooooaaa!” I opened my mouth in a long cry as the rope pulled me 


up. 



Yes! The skis bounced over the surface. I bent my knees and gripped the 
towrope tightly. 

I’m doing it! I realized. I’m water-skiing! 

The boat picked up speed. We headed in a straight line over the sparkling 
water. The cold spray swept over my face, my hair. 

I started to lose my balance. Tugged myself back up. Held on—and kept 
going. 

“Yessss!” I cried out loud. What an awesome feeling! 

But then the driver of the boat turned her head. 

And I recognized Della’s evil grin. 

As she worked the controls, Della’s white-blond hair flew up like wings 
around her pale face. Her blue eyes sparkled like the water. 

Her grin grew wider as she saw the horror on my face. 

“Turn around! Turn back! Please!” I begged. 

She made the boat swerve hard. 

I nearly toppled over. I gripped the towrope. 

My skis slapped the surface. Pain shot up to my knees. The cold spray 
washed over me. 

I gasped. Struggled to breathe. 

Della threw back her head and laughed. The sound was drowned out by the 
roar of the motor. 

I could see the sky through her body. The sunlight poured right through her. 

“Turn around!” I screamed. “Stop! Where are you taking me? Where?” 



26 


Della didn’t answer. She turned away from me, her hair flying wildly behind her 
head. 

The boat bounced over the water, sending up tall waves of foam and spray. 

The waves splashed over me. Chilling me. Blinding me. 

Gripped in panic, it took me a long time to realize that I had an easy escape. 

I let go of the towrope. 

My hands shot up. The tow bar snapped against the water. 

I skidded for a few seconds, my arms thrashing wildly. And then I toppled 
over and sank. 

The life vest pulled me back up. I bounced on the surface, gasping, spitting 
out water. My heart pounded. 

I felt so dizzy. The bright sunlight seemed to surround me. Which way was 
up? Which way to the shore? 

I spun around and saw the motorboat in the distance. 

“You didn’t get me this time!” I called to Della. 

But then I froze as the boat began to turn. Della swerved the boat, kicking 
up a tall wave of white water. 

Swerved it back around. Until it pointed to me. 

I gasped as I heard the motor roar. 

I bobbed helplessly in the water. 

The boat picked up speed, skipping over the rippling surface. 

She’s coming for me, I thought. She’s coming to make me her buddy 
forever. 

I’m trapped out here. 

She’s coming to run me over. 



27 


I treaded water, watching in horror as the boat sped toward me. 

I’ve got to dive under it, I realized. The only way to escape is down. 

I took a deep breath. Every muscle tensed. I knew I had to time my dive 
perfectly. 

The boat roared closer. I could see Della crouched over the motor. Guiding 
the boat. 

Aiming it. 

I took another deep breath. And then I realized I couldn’t dive. 

The life vest—it was holding me up. No way I could plunge beneath the 
surface. 

With a cry, I grabbed the front of the vest with both hands. 

And tugged. 

I can’t do this! I realized. I can’t get this thing off in time! 

The water rocked harder as the boat sped nearer. The whole lake seemed to 
tilt and spin. 

The boat—it’s going to tear me to pieces! I thought. 

I pulled at the vest. Pushed it. 

Please — please—slide over my head! 

No time. No time. 

I can’t dive! 

The motor’s roar drowned out my scream. 

With a frantic tug, I pulled the life vest up. Over my shoulders. 

Too late. 

The front of the boat bounced over me. 

Then the whirring motor blades sliced off my head. 



28 


I waited for the pain. 

I waited for the darkness. 

The water swirled around me. Blue, then green. 

Choking on a mouthful of water, I thrashed up to the surface. Struggling to 
breathe, I let the waves rock me back and forth. 

“The life vest!” I choked out. 

I held half of the vest in each hand. 

The motor blades had sliced the life vest in two. 

I tossed the two pieces away. And started to laugh. 

“I’m alive!” I cried out loud. “I’m still alive!” 

I turned and saw the boat speeding across the lake. Did Della think she had 
won? 

I didn’t care. I spun around. Found the shore. And started to swim. 

My close call gave me new energy. The strong, rocking current helped push 
me back to the camp. 

I heard girls calling to me as I stumbled onto the grass. And I saw Liz 
jogging quickly over. 

“Sarah—” she called. “Sarah—wait!” 

I ignored her. I ignored them all. 

I started to run. 

I knew what I had to do. I had to get away from Camp Cold Lake. I had to 
get away as fast as I could. 

I wasn’t safe here. Not as long as Della wanted me for her buddy. Not as 
long as Della wanted me to drown too. 

I knew no one would believe me. They all said they wanted to help. But no 
one could really help me—not against a ghost! 

I burst into the cabin and tore off my wet swimsuit. Tossing it to the floor, I 
frantically pulled on shorts and a T-shirt. 

I swept my wet hair back with both hands. Tugged on socks and my 
sneakers. 

“Got to get away. Got to get away,” I chanted to myself. 



What to do? Where to go? 

I’ll run through the woods to the town on the other side, I decided. I’ll call 
Mom and Dad. I’ll tell them I’m hiding in town. I’ll tell them to pick me up 
there. 

I stopped at the cabin doorway. 

Should I tell Aaron? 

No. No way, I decided. 

He’ll only try to stop me. 

I’ll get a message to Aaron from town, I decided. I’ll tell him where I am. 
But not until I’m safe. Not until I’m far away from this place. 

I poked my head out of the cabin and searched around, making sure the 
coast was clear. Then I stepped outside and made my way around to the back. 
And ran into Briana. 

She narrowed her eyes at me, studying my face. “You’re going?” she asked 
quietly. 

I nodded. “Yes. I’m going.” 

Once again, Briana’s expression changed. The light in her eyes seemed to 

fade. 


“Good luck,” she whispered. 



29 


Why is she acting so weird? I wondered. 

I didn’t have time to think about it. I gave Briana a wave. Then I ran past 
her and headed into the woods. 

I glanced back as I followed a path between the trees. And saw Briana still 
standing there behind the cabin. Watching me. 

Taking a deep breath, I turned and hurried along the path. 

The trees overhead cut off a lot of the sunlight. It grew darker and cooler as 
I ran. 

A hedge of sharp burrs and brambles scraped my bare arms and legs as I 
tried to edge past. I wished I had worn jeans and a sweatshirt. Something that 
covered me better. 

My sneakers slipped over a thick blanket of dead leaves. I had to skip over 
fallen tree limbs and clumps of thorny weeds. 

Tree roots rose up over the path. Tall, dry reeds leaned over me, as if 
reaching to grab me. 

The narrow path divided in two. I paused—breathing hard—trying to 
decide which path to take. 

Would they both lead me to town? 

I held my breath when I heard a voice. Singing. 

A bird? 

No. A soft voice. A girl’s voice. 

“Oh, no,” I moaned. Raising my eyes to the sound, I saw Della, perched on 
a low tree limb. She tilted her head from side to side as she sang. Her blue eyes 
sparkled, gazing down at me. 

“You—you followed me!” I stammered. “How did you know that I—” My 
voice caught in my throat. 

She giggled. “You’re my buddy,” she replied. “We have to stick together.” 

“No! No way!” I screamed up at her. “You lose, Della. I’m not going to be 
your buddy. Because I’m never going to the lake again. I’m never going to 
drown like you!” 

Della’s smile faded. “Drown?” She shook her head. “Sarah, what made you 
think that? You’re very confused. I didn’t drown.” 



“Huh?” My mouth dropped open. I stared up at her in shock. 

“Close your mouth, Sarah. A fly will fly into it.” Della tilted back her head 
and laughed. 

Then she shook her head again. “How could anyone drown at Camp Cold 
Lake?” she demanded. “They give a lecture about water safety every five 
minutes! No one ever drowned at Camp Cold Lake!” 

“You didn’t drown?” I cried. “Then how did you die?” 

She rested her hands on the tree limb and leaned forward, peering down at 
me. I could see through her body, see the leaves shaking in the breeze. 

“It’s a simple story,” Della said with a sigh. “One night I got tired of 
listening to the water safety lecture at the campfire. So I sneaked off into these 
woods.” 

She swept her hair back with a toss of her head. “I made one major 
mistake,” she continued. “I didn’t know the woods are filled with deadly 
poisonous snakes.” 

I gasped. “These woods? Snakes?” 

Della nodded. “It’s nearly impossible to cross through these woods without 
getting bitten,” she sighed. “I died of a snakebite, Sarah.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. “But you were always at the lake,” I choked out. 
“Why did I always see you at the lake?” 

“Don’t you get it?” she replied. “That was my plan. I made you afraid of the 
lake, Sarah. I made you terrified of the lake. Because I knew you’d try to escape 
through the woods. I knew you’d run into the woods and die like me—and be 
my buddy.” 

“No—!” I protested. “I won’t. I—” 

“Sarah, look!” Della pointed toward the ground. 

I gazed down—and watched a fat black snake curl around my leg. 



30 


“Buddies forever,” Della sang cheerfully. “Buddies forever.” 

I stood frozen, gaping down in horror. Watching the fat snake wind itself 
around me. Feeling its warm, dry body scrape over my bare skin. 

“Nooooo.” A low moan escaped my throat as the snake arched its head. 

“It won’t hurt that much,” Della said brightly. “It’s like a bee sting, Sarah. 
That’s all.” 

The snake let out a loud hiss. It snapped open its jaws. 

I felt its body tighten like a warm rope around my leg. 

“Buddies forever,” Della sang. “Buddies forever...” 

“No! Sarah is not your buddy!” a voice rang out. 

I tried to turn toward the voice. But I couldn’t move. I felt the snake tighten 
its hold on my leg. 

“Briana!” I cried. “What are you doing here?” 

She hurried out from behind a clump of tall reeds. 

With one quick motion, she grabbed the snake in one hand. Slid it off my 
leg. And tossed it into the trees. 

Briana raised her eyes to Della. “Sarah can’t be your buddy, because she’s 
my buddy!” Briana shouted. 

Della’s eyes grew wide. She cried out in surprise. She gripped the tree 
branch to keep from falling. 

“You!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” 

“Yes, it’s me!” Briana shouted up to her. “I’m back, Della.” 

“But—but how did you...” Della’s voice trailed off. 

“You tried to do the same thing to me last year,” Briana said. “You tried all 
summer to make me your buddy. You terrified me—didn’t you, Della?” 

Briana uttered an angry cry. “You didn’t think I’d come back. But I did. I 
came back to camp this summer... to protect the next girl!” 

“Nooo!” Della wailed. 

I finally understood. I stepped up to the tree beside Briana. “Briana is my 
buddy!” I declared. “And I’m coming back next summer to warn the next girl!” 

“No! No! Nooooo!” Della raged. “You can’t do that! I’ve waited so long! 



So lonnnng!” 

She let go of the tree limb and shook her fists at Briana and me. 

Lost her balance. 

Her hands flew up as she started to fall. 

She grabbed for the limb. Missed. 

And dropped silently to the ground. 

Then she was gone. 

Vanished. 

With a weary sigh, I climbed to my feet. I shook my head. “Is she gone for 
good?” I murmured. 

Briana shrugged. “I don’t know. I hope so.” 

I turned to Briana. “You—you saved my life!” I cried. “Thank you for 
following me. Thank you for saving me!” 

With a happy cry, I stepped up to her. “Thank you! Thank you!” 

I wrapped my arms around her to hug her. 

And my hands went right through her body. 

I gasped. I grabbed her shoulder. But I couldn’t feel a thing. 

I jumped back in shock. 

Briana narrowed her eyes at me. “Della killed me last summer, Sarah,” she 
said softly. “On the last day. But I didn’t want to be her buddy. I just never liked 
her.” 

She floated forward, raised herself off the ground, hovered over me. 

“But I need a buddy,” she whispered. “Everyone has to have a buddy. 
You’ll be my buddy—won’t you, Sarah?” 

I saw the hissing snake in her hand. 

But I couldn’t move. 

“You’ll be my buddy—won’t you?” Briana repeated. “You’ll be my buddy 
forever.”

MY BEST FRIEND 
IS INVISIBLE 

Goosebumps - 57 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


I sat at the dinner table and wished I was invisible. 

If I were invisible, I could sneak away from dinner without finishing my 
string beans. And I could creep up to my room and finish the book of ghost 
stories I’d been reading. 

I started to daydream. I’m Sammy Jacobs, the Invisible Boy, I told myself. I 
tried to picture how I’d look if I were invisible. 

Last week, I saw a movie about an invisible man. You couldn’t see his face 
or his body. But when he ate, you could see the food digesting in his invisible 
stomach. 

It was totally gross. 

I loved it. 

Staring at my string beans, I pictured them rolling around in my stomach. 

My parents’ voices droned on in the background. My parents are research 
scientists. They work in a college lab. They do weird things with light and lasers. 

And then they come home and talk about their work at dinner. And talk 
about their work. And talk about their work. 

My ten-year-old brother, Simon, and I can’t get a word in. 

We have to sit and listen to them talk about “light refraction” and “ocular 
impediments”. 

I’m a science-fiction freak. I love reading science-fiction books and comics. 
And I rent any movie that has an alien from another planet in it. 

But when I have to listen to my parents talk about their work, I feel like an 
alien from another planet. I mean, I can’t understand a single word they say! 

“Hey, Mom and Dad.” I tried to get into the conversation. “Guess what? I 
grew a tail today.” 

Mom and Dad didn’t hear me. They were too busy arguing about something 
called “morphology”. 

“Actually, I grew two tails,” I said, louder. 

They didn’t care. Dad was drawing some kind of chart on his napkin. 

I was really bored. I kicked Simon under the table. Just for something to do. 

“Ow! Stop it, Sammy!” he cried. He kicked me back. 



I kicked him again. 

Dad kept scribbling numbers all over his napkin. Mom squinted at his chart. 

Simon kicked me back. Too hard. 

“Whoa!” I screamed. My hands flew up—and sent my dinner plate flying. 

SPLAAT. 

Into my lap. 

A whole plateful of spaghetti and all the string beans—slid down my jeans. 

“Look what Simon made me do!” I shouted. 

“You started it!” Simon protested. 

Mom glanced up from the chart. At least I had her attention. And maybe I’d 
even get Simon into trouble. Simon never gets yelled at. He’s good. 

Mom’s gaze shifted from me to Simon. “Simon,” Mom started. 

All right! I thought. Simon is in for it now! 

“Help your clumsy brother clean up,” Mom said. She glanced down at the 
floor and pointed to the pile of spaghetti. “And make sure you mop up this 
mess.” Then she grabbed Dad’s pencil and scribbled a bunch of numbers next to 
his. 

Simon tried to help me clean up. But I pushed him away and did it myself. 

Was I steamed? Take a guess. 

Okay. Okay. Maybe the spaghetti wasn’t Simon’s fault. But nothing is ever 
Simon’s fault. Ever. 

Why? 

I told you—Simon is the good one. He never waits until the last minute to 
do his homework. He never has to be reminded to throw his clothes in the 
hamper. Or take out the garbage. Or wipe his feet when he comes in the house. 

What kind of kid is that? 

A mutant —if you ask me. 

“Simon is a mutant,” I mumbled as I used my napkin to wipe my dinner 
from my lap. 

“My Brother—the Mutant.” I smiled. I liked the sound of that. It would 
make a good science-fiction movie, I decided. 

I tossed the paper napkin into the trash and returned to the table. 

Well, at least I won’t have to eat any more string beans, I thought, staring 
down at my empty plate. 

Wrong. 

“Sammy, give me your dish. I’ll refill it.” Mom stood up, took my plate— 



and slipped on the spaghetti on the floor. 

Uh-oh. 

I watched as she lost her balance and slid across the kitchen. I laughed. I 
couldn’t help it. I mean, she looked pretty funny—sliding across the floor like 
that. 

“Who laughed?” Mom turned to face us. “Was it you, Simon?” 

“Of course not,” Simon answered. 

Of course not. Simon’s favorite words. 

Simon—do you want to watch TV? Of course not. Want to play ball? Of 
course not. Want to hear a joke? Of course not. 

Simon would never laugh at Mom. 

Simon did only serious things. 

Simon—the Serious Mutant. 

Mom turned to me and let out a long sigh. She returned to the table with my 
plate. Refilled. With lots more string beans. Great. 

Disappear. Disappear. I stared at my string beans and chanted silently. Last 
week I read a story about a kid who could make things disappear just by 
concentrating hard. 

It wasn’t working for me. 

“I can’t wait for Saturday to come,” I said, burying the string beans under 
the spaghetti. 

“Why?” Simon was the only one who asked. 

“I’m going to see School Spirit,” I told him. 

“School spirit?” Dad glanced up from his napkin chart, his eyes finally 
wide with interest. “School spirit is great! Who has school spirit?” 

“Nobody, Dad. School Spirit is the name of a new movie. It’s about a ghost 
that haunts an old boarding school,” I explained. “I’m going to see it on 
Saturday.” 

Dad placed his pencil down. “I wish you were more interested in real 
science, Sammy. I think real science is even stranger than the fantasy stuff you 
like.” 

“But ghosts are real, Dad!” 

“Your dad and I are scientists, Sammy,” Mom said. “We don’t believe in 
things like ghosts.” 

“Well, you’re wrong,” I declared. “If ghosts don’t exist, why have there 
been stories about them for hundreds of years? 



“Besides, this movie isn’t fantasy stuff,” I told them. “It’s a true story. Real 
kids were interviewed for it. Kids who swear they saw the ghost in school!” 

Mom shook her head. 

Dad chuckled. “What are you doing in school, Simon? Seen any ghosts 
lately?” 

“Of course not,” Simon replied. “I’m starting my science project this week. 
It’s called: How Fast Do We Grow? I’m going to study myself for six months. 
And make a growth graph for every part of my body.” 

“That’s wonderful!” Mom said. 

“Very original!” Dad exclaimed. “Let us know if we can help.” 

“Oh, brother,” I mumbled, rolling my eyes. “Can I be excused?” I pushed 
my chair away from the table. “Roxanne is coming over to do math homework.” 

Roxanne Johnson and I are both in the same seventh-grade class. We like to 
compete against each other. Just for fun. 

At least, I think it’s for fun. Sometimes I’m not sure what Roxanne thinks. 

Anyway, she’s one of my best friends. She likes science fiction too. We 
planned to see School Spirit together. 

I went upstairs to search for my math book. 

I opened the door to my room. 

I stepped inside—and gasped.

My homework papers lay scattered all over the floor. 

I’m not exactly the neatest kid in the world—but I do not throw my 
homework on the floor. 

Not usually, anyway. 

Well, at least not today. 

Brutus—my orange cat—sat in the middle of the mess, with his head buried 
underneath the pile of papers. 

“Brutus—did you do this?” I demanded. Brutus jerked his head up. He 
glanced at me—then darted under my bed to hide. 

Hmmm. That’s weird, I thought. Brutus actually looks scared. That is 
definitely weird. 

Brutus never hides from anything. In fact, he’s the meanest cat in the 
neighborhood. Every kid on the block has been scratched by Brutus—at least 
once. 

I looked at the window. It was open. The light-blue curtains billowed in the 
breeze. 

I gathered my papers from the floor. The wind probably blew them off my 
desk, I guessed. 

Wait a minute. Something was wrong. 

I stared at the window. 

I could swear I left that window closed. 

But I couldn’t have. I mean, there it was—wide-open. 

“What are you looking at?” Roxanne stepped into my room. 

“Something weird is going on here,” I told her, shutting the window. “I 
closed this before dinner. Now it’s open.” 

“Your mom must have opened it,” she said. “What’s the big deal, anyway? 
It’s just the window.” 

“It’s no big deal,” I said. “But my mom didn’t open it. Neither did Dad or 
Simon. We were all downstairs.” 

I shook my head. “I know I closed it. Brutus was the only one up here—and 
he didn’t open it.” 

I peered under the bed. There was Brutus—snuggled against my sneakers. 



Shaking. 

“Come on, Brutus. Come out,” I urged softly. “Don’t be afraid. I know she’s 
scary—but it’s only Roxanne.” 

“Very funny, Sammy.” Roxanne rolled her eyes. “I’ll tell you what’s scary. 
Your brother is scary.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“I passed him on the way up here. Do you know what he was doing?” she 
asked. 

“No,” I said. 

“He was lying on the living room floor. On a huge piece of cardboard. 
Tracing himself,” Roxanne replied. 

I shrugged. “He must be working on his science project. He’s studying 
himself.” 

“Your brother is definitely scary,” she said. “I’ll tell you something else 
that’s scary—the way you ran today. That was very, very scary. I didn’t think 
anyone could run that slow!” 

Roxanne beat me in the track race at school today. And she wasn’t going to 
let me forget it. 

“You won because of only ONE reason,” I told her. 

“And what was that ONE reason?” she mimicked me. 

I slid halfway under the bed and dragged Brutus out. Stalling for time. 
Stalling so I could come up with a good reason. 

“You won because—I let you!” I said finally. 

“Yeah, right, Sammy.” Roxanne folded her arms across her chest. 

“I did. I let you,” I insisted. 

Roxanne’s cheeks turned red. I could see she was getting really steamed. 

Making Roxanne angry is fun. 

“I let you win—because I wanted to help build up your confidence for the 
school Olympics,” I said. 

Whoa! That made Roxanne even angrier. Roxanne doesn’t like help from 
anyone. And she likes to think she’s the best at everything. 

Our school is going to compete against other schools in a mini-Olympics 
next week. Roxanne and I are both on the Olympic team. We were both on the 
team last year too. Roxanne ran every single day to make sure she was the best. 

But last year, we lost. 

I guess it was my fault. A camera flashed in my face. I tripped—and fell. 



“You lost fair and square today, Sammy—and you know it,” Roxanne 
snapped. “And you’d better not trip next week. And make us lose the Olympics 
again.” 

“Last year wasn’t my fault!” I cried. But Roxanne interrupted me. 

“Hey—what’s wrong with Brutus?” she asked, peering over my shoulder. 

I turned around and saw Brutus sitting in the corner—curled up in a tight 

ball. 

“I don’t know. He’s acting kind of strange today,” I said. 

“I know,” she agreed. “He didn’t even try to scratch me yet. He’s been 
acting— nice.” 

Brutus stood. He glanced at the window—and arched his back. 

Then he turned completely around and sat down, facing the wall. 

Weird. 

“So? What are we going to do for our term project?” Roxanne asked, 
plopping down on my bed. 

Our term project for our English class was due next month. Ms. Starkling, 
our teacher, wanted us to work in pairs. She said working in pairs would help us 
learn about teamwork and cooperation. 

“I have a really great idea,” I said. “How about a report on plants? You 
know—how much water they need. Stuff like that.” 

“That’s a really great idea,” Roxanne replied. “If you’re in kindergarten.” 

“Okay. Okay. Let me think.” I stood up and paced the room. “Got it! How 
about the life cycle of a moth? We could catch some—and see how long they 
take to die!” 

Roxanne stared at me. She nodded her head thoughtfully. “I think... that’s 
really stupid,” she said. 

So much for teamwork and cooperation. 

“Fine.” I folded my arms in front of me. “Why don’t you try to come up 
with an idea?” 

“I already have,” Roxanne declared. “I think we should do a report on True 
Haunted Houses. I know a haunted house right here in Middletown. It’s near the 
woods. Across from the college. I bet we’ll find a real ghost living there!” 

“There are no haunted houses in Middletown,” I said. “I know all about 
haunted houses—and there isn’t one anywhere near here.” 

“The house near the woods is haunted,” Roxanne insisted. “And that’s what 
we should study for our report. I’ll talk to the ghost and take notes. Your job will 



be to videotape us.” 

Roxanne never backs down. 

Sometimes that’s what I like about her. 

And sometimes that’s what I hate about her. Like now. 

“Don’t waste your time, Roxanne. I’m practically an expert on ghosts. That 
house is not haunted.” I tried to give Roxanne some good advice. 

A bad mistake. 

“You just don’t want to videotape us. You want to be the one who talks to 
the ghost and takes the notes,” she accused. 

I let out a sigh. 

“But it was my idea—so I get to pick first,” Roxanne said. “Ms. Starkling 
will go crazy when we find a real ghost for our project. We’ll probably win an 
award or something.” 

“We won’t find any ghosts in this town.” I shook my head. “This place is 
too boring. Nothing exciting ever happens here....” 

I stopped talking. 

A low, frightening moan filled the room. 

Roxanne jumped off the bed. 

She moved close to me. 

We slowly turned toward the sound. Coming from the hall. 

“Wh-what’s that?” Roxanne’s voice shook, pointing to the doorway. 

We both stared in horror—at an eerie light just outside my room. An eerie 
white light. 

We took a step back. 

The light grew brighter. 

Closer. 

It filled the doorway now. 

I held my breath. 

“Sammy —what is it?” Roxanne’s voice quivered. 

“I—I don’t know.” 

I watched the strange white light begin to roll and shimmer and stretch—as 
it reached for us.

We backed up against the wall. 

The light grew stronger, whiter. 

Blinding now. 

Another moan floated toward us—and I gasped. 

“A... ghost!” I cried. “No. It’s a... Dad?” 

Dad stepped into the room. Carrying some sort of bright light. 

“That’s about as real a ghost as youTl ever find!” Dad laughed. 

My heart stopped pounding. 

Brutus let out a loud wail and darted from the room. 

“Whoa—I didn’t think anything could scare that cat!” Dad laughed again. 

Mom burst into the room. “You said you were bringing that laser light home 
to repair it. Not to terrify these kids,” she scolded Dad. 

“Give me a break. It was just a joke.” Dad turned to us. “You thought it was 
funny—right, Sammy? Roxanne?” 

“Yeah... very funny, Dad,” I said, rolling my eyes. “One of your best jokes. 
Areal riot.” 

“I knew it was a laser light.” Roxanne moved back toward the bed. She sat 
down, trying to look cool. “When I saw how scared Sammy was, I played along. 
Super trick, Mr. Jacobs. We really fooled Sammy!” 

We really fooled Sammy! We? 

I wanted to strangle Roxanne. 

Sometimes I hate her. HATE her. 

Simon wandered into the room, carrying Brutus. “Your stupid cat ran over 
my body-tracing. He ruined it. Now I have to start all over again.” 

Simon let Brutus drop to the floor. He glanced at the light Dad held in his 
hand. Then he looked at me. 

“Sammy didn’t fall for that dumb light trick—did he?” he asked. 

“Why don’t you go watch your toes grow!” I shouted at my brother. 

“No. This is a different dumb light trick,” Dad chuckled. 

Mom cleared her throat—a warning to Dad. 

“Actually, Simon, this light is called a Molecule Detector Light.” Dad tried 



to turn serious. “Here—have a look at it.” He handed the light to Simon. 

It looked like a regular flashlight—but it definitely wasn’t. 

A regular flashlight didn’t shine with a shimmery, white, blinding light. 
“What does it do?” Simon studied the shiny silver casing that housed the 

laser. 

“It’s kind of like an X-ray,” Dad explained. “I can shine it in the air and see 
all kinds of insects and things that you normally can’t see.” 

“I know what we can use it for.” Simon turned the light toward me. “We 
can use it to find Sammy’s BRAIN!” 

Everyone laughed. Even Mom. 

“Hey! Good one!” Roxanne patted Simon on the back. “That’s the first time 
I ever heard you make a joke.” 

“I wasn’t joking,” Simon said flatly. 

That made everyone laugh even harder. 

“Out!” I yelled. “I want you all to leave!” 

Mom, Dad, and Simon left the room. Still laughing. 

“What about our math homework?” Roxanne demanded. “I thought we 
were going to do it together.” 

“I don’t feel like doing it now,” I grumbled. 

“Okay. Okay.” Roxanne backed out of the room. “You don’t have to do it. 
But I do. Ms. Starkling said it’s my turn at the chalkboard tomorrow. I want to 
make sure I get the equations right.” 

Roxanne left to do her homework. 

I opened my math book to do mine. 

I stared down at the numbers. 

But I couldn’t concentrate. 

I’ll get up early, I decided. And do my homework in the morning. 

I got up from my desk to change for bed. 

Brutus jumped into my desk chair—his favorite place to sleep. 

I crossed the room—and tripped on something in the middle of the floor. 
“Hey—what was that?” I spun around. 

I glanced at the floor. 

“Huh?” 

Nothing there. 



4 


I stared at the floor. 

I shook my head. 

I tripped over— nothing? 

It’s a good thing Roxanne didn’t see this one, I thought. I could hear her 
making fun of me now. “Practicing—to make sure we lose the race next week, 
Sammy?” 

I got into bed. 

I propped up my pillows and picked up the ghost-story book I was reading. 
I stared down at the page, but it was all just a blur. 

I closed the book and drifted off to sleep. But I tossed and turned all night 
long. Half asleep, half awake, I fluffed up my pillow. I pulled the covers up 
around me. I drifted off again—then woke up to a noise. 

Flapping. 

The flapping of my curtains in the night breeze. 

I sat up. I rubbed my eyes. 

I stared at the window. 

The open window! 

I bolted out of bed and slammed it shut. 

Who opened this window? WHO? 

Is it possible for a window to slide up? 

NO. 

It must be Simon. Simon must be playing a joke on me, I decided. 

But it couldn’t be Simon. Simon doesn’t play jokes. He’s always serious. 

I climbed back in bed—and stared at the window. Watching. Waiting. 
Waiting to see it open. 

But my eyelids grew heavy and I fell asleep. 

The next morning I woke up late. Brutus always wakes me up. But he didn’t 
today. 

I bolted up in bed to check the window. Closed. 

I glanced at my desk chair. Brutus was gone. 



I dressed quickly. I caught my reflection in the mirror as I headed out of my 
room. I looked wrecked. 

“Sammy, you look awful,” Mom said. “Did you get to bed late last night?” 

I slumped down at the kitchen table. Dad sat across from me, reading the 
newspaper. 

“No, not too late,” I told Mom. 

Dad peered over the newspaper. “You’re reading too many of those ghost 
books, Sammy. If you read about real science, you’d sleep better.” 

Dad went back to his newspaper. 

Mom poured some cereal into my breakfast bowl. I ate one spoonful—and 
Simon called me. 

“Sammy—come up here,” he shouted from his bedroom. “I need your 
help.” 

I ignored him. 

I ate another spoonful. 

“SAM-MY!” he screamed. 

“Sammy, go see what your brother wants,” Mom ordered. 

“SAM-MY! SAM-MY!” 

“WHAT?” I cried, charging into his room. “What’s your problem?” 

“That!” he said, pointing to the bed. “That is my problem.” 

Brutus lay curled up in Simon’s bed. 

“He slept in here last night,” Simon said. “And now I can’t get him out. He 
won’t move.” 

“Brutus slept in here?” 

I couldn’t believe it. 

Brutus always sleeps in my room. Always. 

“Yes, he slept in here,” Sammy said. “And I want him out!” 

“What’s the big deal? Just leave him there.” I turned to the door. 

“Wait!” Simon yelled. “I can’t leave him there. I can’t!” 

“Why not?” I asked, confused. 

“Because I have to make my bed,” Simon answered. 

I stared hard at my brother. “What planet are you from?” 

“Sammy,” Simon whined. “I have to make my bed. Mom says.” 

“Just make the bed over him. Mom won’t notice the lump.” 

I returned to the kitchen a few seconds later. I sat down at the table. 



Mom peered over my shoulder. “Sammy, how did you finish your cereal so 
fast?” 

“Huh?” 

I stared down into my breakfast bowl. 

Totally empty! 



5 


“Someone—someone ate my cereal!” I stammered. 

“You’re right!” Mom gasped. “It must have been a ghost!” 

Mom and Dad laughed. 

I stared at the empty bowl—and the spoon. 

“Look!” I shouted. “Someone did eat my cereal. I have proof. The spoon— 
it’s on the left side of the bowl. I always put my spoon on the right side of the 
bowl—because I’m right-handed. See?” 

I pointed to the spoon. 

To the proof. 

“Stop kidding around, Sammy. You’re going to be late for school.” Mom 
turned to Dad. “We’d better get going too.” 

“Did you do it?” I asked Dad as he reached for his briefcase. “Did you eat 
my cereal? Did you move the spoon? Was it a joke?” 

“You’re reading too many ghost stories,” Dad said. “Way too many.” Then 
he and Mom hurried off for work. 

For a few minutes, I sat at the kitchen table. Just sat there, staring into my 
empty cereal bowl. 

Someone ate my cereal. 

I am not going crazy, I told myself. 

Someone ate my cereal. 

But who? 

“Sammy. Sammy.” 

Huh? 

“Sammy, would you like to tell us what is so fascinating outside?” Ms. 
Starkling crossed her arms in front of her, waiting for my answer. 

A few kids giggled. 

I had been gazing out the classroom window. Thinking—about my window. 
My open bedroom window. And my disappearing cereal. 

“Uh—no. I mean, nothing,” I said. “I mean—I wasn’t looking at anything.” 
Some more giggles. 



“Sammy, come up to the chalkboard, please, and show the class how to 
finish this equation.” 

“But it’s Roxanne’s turn,” I blurted out. “I mean, isn’t Roxanne supposed to 
show the class today?” 

“Sammy, please.” Ms. Starkling tapped the chalkboard with a piece of 
chalk. “Now.” 

I glanced at Roxanne. She just shrugged her shoulders. 

I was in big trouble. 

I didn’t do my math homework last night. And I didn’t do it this morning, 
either—because Brutus didn’t wake me up on time. 

My temples pounded as I made my way to the front of the classroom. I 
walked slowly. Staring at the equation. Trying to figure out how to solve it 
before I got up there. 

I had no idea. 

Ms. Starkling handed me the piece of chalk. 

Silence fell over the classroom. 

I stared hard at the numbers on the board. 

My palms began to sweat. 

“Read the equation out loud,” Ms. Starkling suggested. She said it nicely. 
But I could tell she was losing her patience. 

I read the equation out loud. 

It didn’t help. 

I lifted the chalk to the board, even though I still didn’t know what to do. 

I stared at the numbers some more. 

I heard the sounds of kids shifting impatiently in their seats. 

I placed the chalk against the board—and gasped. 

I felt something squeeze my hand. Something cold and wet. 

My knees started to shake. 

I felt hot breath right up against my face. 

I tried to step back—but I couldn’t move. 

Something squeezed my fingers tighter and tighter. Squeezed until it hurt. 

The breathing against my face grew more rapid—sharp gasps that stung my 
cheeks. 

I wanted to pull free. But then my hand started to move across the 
chalkboard. 

My hand was moving—and it started to write! 



Someone was writing numbers for me! Someone was holding my hand! 
Moving it! Solving the equation! 

Someone I couldn’t see! 



6 


I yanked my hand back. I jerked free of the clammy, invisible grip. 

Then I dropped the chalk—and started screaming. 

And ran from the room. 

I ran into the hall. I leaned against the wall outside the classroom. My hands 
were shaking. My knees trembled. 

I could still feel the cold, ghostly fingers wrapped around my hand. 

I heard Roxanne inside—volunteering to finish the equation. 

“Sammy.” Ms. Starkling met me out in the hall. “What happened? Are you 
sick? Would you like to see the school nurse?” 

“I’m—I’m not sick,” I stammered. 

I didn’t want to explain what happened. 

I couldn’t explain it. I didn’t even want to try. 

“Are you sure you don’t want to see the nurse? You don’t look well.” Ms. 
Starkling felt my forehead. 

“No. I’m okay,” I lied. “I—I just felt a little dizzy—because I didn’t eat 
breakfast this morning.” 

Ms. Starkling believed me. She sent me to the lunchroom to get something 
to eat. 

As I made my way down the hall, I could still feel the clammy hand 
gripping my fingers. 

Still feel the hot breath on my face. 

Still feel the cold force as it pushed my hand along the board. Guiding it. 
Writing the numbers for me. 

I shivered. 

Maybe Dad is right. Maybe I have been reading too many ghost stories. 

I walked home alone after school. I wanted to be by myself. To think. 

I heard footsteps behind me. Footsteps pounding the pavement. Running 
toward me. 

“Sammy—wait up!” It was Roxanne. 

I pretended I didn’t hear her. I kept walking. 



“Sammy!” Roxanne caught up—out of breath. “What happened to you 
today?” 

“Nothing happened.” 

“Something happened,” she insisted. “Something happened to you in math 
class.” 

“I don’t want to talk about it,” I told her. 

“I’m really good at math,” Roxanne said smugly. “I’d be happy to help you 
—if you don’t understand it.” 

“I... don’t... need... help,” I replied through gritted teeth. I began to walk 
faster—but Roxanne kept up with me. 

We didn’t talk. 

Finally, Roxanne broke the silence. “Let’s go to the haunted house Saturday 
night. For our project. Okay?” 

“Maybe. I have to get home now. I’ll call you later to talk about it.” 

I broke into a run—and left Roxanne on the sidewalk, staring after me. 

I wanted to get home. 

I wanted to think about everything that had happened. 

I wanted to think about it—by myself. 

As I headed into the house, I wondered about my bedroom window. Would 
it be open? I made sure it was closed before I left this morning. But that didn’t 
mean anything. 

I started up the stairs. But I stopped when I heard Brutus meowing loudly in 
the kitchen. He always does that when he wants to go out. 

“Okay. Okay. I’m coming.” 

Brutus started to wail. 

“Hold it down, Brutus. I said I was—” 

I stopped in the kitchen door. 

There was Brutus—crouched on a chair. His fur stood straight up. He pulled 
back his lips in a menacing hiss. 

I followed his gaze—and let out a shriek. 

A pizza sat on the table. 

A slice from the pie floated above the plate—floated up by itself. 

I stared in shock as it rose higher and higher. 

“Who—who’s there?” I stammered. “I know someone is there! Who ARE 


you?” 



7 


“Who are you?” I demanded again. 

No answer. 

I stared at the pizza slice. Stared as it floated in midair. 

I watched as it was chewed up. Bite by bite. 

“Tell me who you are!” I shouted. “You’re really scaring me!” 

Another bite disappeared from the floating slice of pizza. And another. 

“This isn’t happening. It can’t be,” I whispered. 

I’ll close my eyes. When I open them—I’ll see that I imagined the whole 
thing, I told myself. 

And I’ll never read a ghost book again, I promised. 

Or watch a sci-fi movie. 

Another bite of the pizza disappeared. 

I closed my eyes. 

I opened them. 

The slice of pizza was gone. 

I let out a long sigh of relief. 

Then I realized it was gone—EATEN. 

“WHO ARE YOU?” I demanded. “Tell me—right now. Or I’ll—” 

“Sammy—who are you talking to?” Mom stood in the kitchen doorway, 
staring at me. 

“There’s someone here!” I cried. “Someone eating pizza!” 

“I can see that!” Mom said. “I can see that someone has eaten half a pizza 
—before dinner. Sammy, you know you’re not supposed to eat before dinner!” 

“I didn’t! It wasn’t me!” I cried. 

“Of course it wasn’t you,” Mom said. “It was the ghost from this morning 
—right? The one who ate your cereal. Sammy, please. This is serious. How 
many times have I told you—no snacking before dinner. You’re old enough to 
know better!” 

“But, Mom—” 

“No huts! I want you to go up to your room and straighten it up before we 
eat,” Mom ordered. “You left it a mess this morning. Please put your dirty 



clothes in the hamper and make your bed.” 

“But half the day is over. It doesn’t make sense to make my bed now,” I 
argued. 

“Sam-my!” Mom narrowed her eyes. Mom narrows her eyes when she’s 
angry. Right now her eyes were really narrowed. “GO!” 

Mom opened the refrigerator to get a drink. 

I turned to leave the kitchen—and froze. 

Right behind Mom, Brutus started to rise up from the kitchen chair. 
Floating up. Rising higher and higher. 

His fur stood straight up. He gazed down at the floor and let out a cry. He 
stretched out his paws to leap— 

“Mom, look!” I cried. “Look at Brutus!” 

Mom whirled around—too late. Brutus had landed safely back on the 
kitchen chair. 

Mom’s eyes grew really, really narrow. “Go up to your room now, Sammy!” 

What could I do? 

I left the kitchen and headed for the stairs. I turned into my room—and 
gasped. 

My room! 

My room looked like a garbage dump. 

Cereal boxes were strewn on the bed. Greasy food containers and crushed 
juice boxes littered my desk, my dresser, my chair—everywhere. 

I took a step inside and heard a loud crunch. I glanced down—and groaned. 
Frosted Flakes and Corn Pops carpeted the floor. 

“Who did this?” I cried. “WHO TRASHED MY ROOM?” 

I collapsed on my bed—and felt something sticky on the back of my pants. 
“Oooh, gross!” I moaned. “Peanut butter and jelly.” 

I pulled back the blanket for a clean place to sit—and found strands of last 
night’s spaghetti and some half-eaten chicken legs. 

“Who would do this?” I shook my head. “WHO?” 

Does Simon’s room look like this? I wondered. And Mom and Dad’s room? 
I ran down the hall to check. 

Simon’s room was spotless. Mom and Dad’s room was perfectly clean too. 

I walked back to my room—and froze. 

“Sammy!” Mom planted her hands firmly on her hips. Her face burned red 
with anger. “What have you done?” 



8 


“I—I didn’t do it, Mom!” I cried. “I didn’t make this mess!” 

“Give me a break,” Mom sighed. “If you didn’t do it, who did? I didn’t do 
it! Your father didn’t do it! Simon didn’t do it! Tell me, Sammy—who did it?” 

“M-maybe it was Simon.” I didn’t know what else to say. But I shouldn’t 
have said that. 

“First you trash your room. Then you try to blame your little brother! 
Sammy—I don’t know what’s gotten into you! I don’t want to see you 
downstairs until this room sparkles. Your father and I will discuss what to do 
about you later.” 

Mom turned to leave. “And don’t come down for dinner. You’ve eaten quite 
enough!” 

I stood in the center of my room and listened to Mom’s footsteps fade down 
the stairs. 

“How am I going to clean this mess?” I moaned. “It will take me a year.” 

“I’ll help you.” 

Who said that? 

I spun around to face the doorway. 

No one there. 

“Come on, Sammy,” a boy’s voice urged. “Let’s get going, or we’ll never 
clean up this mess.” 

I watched in disbelief as a cereal box floated up from my bed. Floated up 
and threw itself into the trash. 

“Who—who are you?” I stammered. “How do you know my name?” 

Another cereal box started to rise. And another. They tossed themselves 
into the trash too. 

I waited for the boy to answer me. 

But he didn’t. 

I stared at the last cereal box—waiting for it to rise up. 

It didn’t move. 

“Where are you?” I whispered. 

No answer. 



I scanned my bedroom—searching for a sign of him. Where did he go? 

I heard a rustling sound and spun around. 

My pillow hovered in the air. I watched as the pillowcase slid off it—all by 
itself! 

“Where are the clean sheets, Sammy? You know, you should make your bed 
in the morning—like Simon.” 

“How do you know me?” My voice started to rise. “How do you know my 
name? Who are you?” 

“Calm down,” the boy said. “No reason to get stressed. I arrived last night. I 
found out your name from Roxanne.” 

“You—you know Roxanne?” I sputtered. 

“No. I don’t know Roxanne. I heard her use your name last night,” he 
explained. “When she came over to do homework with you.” 

“What... are... you?” I asked slowly. 

My heart pounded as I waited for the boy’s answer. But he didn’t answer 
me. 

“WHAT ARE YOU?” I cried out. “Tell me! WHAT ARE YOU? Are you 
a... GHOST?” 



9 


“A ghost!” The boy broke into a fit of laughter. 

“You don’t believe in ghosts—do you?” the boy asked. 

“No, of course not,” I shouted. “I don’t believe in ghosts. I just believe in 
invisible kids!” 

“Okay. Okay. I see your point,” he said. “No—I’m not a ghost. I’m alive.” 

A loud, scraping sound cut through the air. 

I jumped in surprise—and saw my chair move out from my desk. 

“I hope it’s okay if I sit down,” he said. “Wow—is it hot in here.” 
Yesterday’s math homework floated up from my desk and began fanning the air. 

“Are you the one who keeps opening my bedroom window?” I demanded. 

“Uh-huh. It’s really hot up here. Why do you keep it so hot in your room?” 
he asked. 

“Forget about the window!” I said. “What do you want? Why are you here? 
Did you trash my room?” 

“Uh... I guess I really made a mess in here. I was really hungry. Sorry. But 
I’ll help you clean up.” The boy’s voice grew softer. “I just want to be your 
friend, Sammy.” 

“That’s ridiculous!” I said. “How can you be my friend? I can’t even see 
you! You’re invisible!” 

“I know,” the boy said softly. He sounded kind of sad. “I’ve been invisible 
for as long as I can remember. That’s why it’s so hard to have friends.” 

“Well—where are your parents?” I asked. 

“I don’t know. I really don’t. My parents left me here for some reason. I 
don’t know where they went. I know my name. That’s about it. My name is 
Brent Green, and I’m twelve.” 

Brent Green. An invisible boy. Right in my room. 

It was hard to believe. 

I mean, I’ve read a ton of science-fiction books. And I really believe in a lot 
of that stuff. But an invisible boy right in my room. Whoa! 

“Brent, I don’t know if I can be friends with you. I mean—this is weird.” 

“Sammy, who are you talking to?” Simon walked into my room. He 
glanced around. “Hey! There’s no one here. Were you talking to yourself?” 



I turned away from my desk chair. “Yeah, Simon. I was talking to myself.” 

I didn’t want to tell Simon about Brent. Not yet anyway. I wanted to find 
out more about him first. 

I wanted to be an expert on invisible people before I told anyone in my 
family! 

“You’re nuts, Sammy. You’re really nuts.” Simon gazed around the room. 
“Boy, this place is a total mess. How could you do this? No wonder Mom is so 
angry. You are in major trouble. Major trouble.” 

Simon picked up a chicken bone from my bed. “Yuck!” He held it between 
two fingers, then let it drop back on the sheet. “That’s gross!” 

He tiptoed carefully over the cereal on the floor. 

He slowly made his way to my chair. Brent’s chair. 

“Don’t sit there—” I tried to warn Simon. 

But it was too late. 



10 


I watched as the chair flew out from under Simon. Flew out—all by itself. 

Simon landed hard on the floor! He sat in a glob of grape jelly, his mouth 
gaping open in shock. 

“That was mean, Sammy! I’m telling Mom!” 

“I didn’t do anything!” I protested. “You missed the chair. It was your own 
fault!” 

Simon struggled to his feet and marched out of my room. 

“Ha! Ha!” Brent laughed. “Good one! Right, Sammy? I pulled the chair 
right out from under him!” 

Simon was downstairs right now—telling Mom what a horrible thing I had 
done to him. But I was already in trouble, I decided. So what difference did it 
make? And I had to admit it—watching Simon fall was pretty funny. 

Maybe having an invisible friend wouldn’t be too weird after all. I mean—it 
could be kind of fun. 

“Brent—what is it like to be invisible? I mean—can you walk through 
things?” I asked. 

“No,” Brent answered. “I can’t walk through anything.” 

“Are you... uh... dressed?” I asked. 

Brent laughed. “Don’t worry, Sammy. I’m dressed,” he said. Then he 
sighed loudly. “You know, I’m just a regular kid. I’m just like you—only 
invisible.” 

I’m just like you—only invisible. 

Suddenly I had a great idea. 

“Brent, could you make me invisible? Just for a little while. So I could see 
what it’s like?” 

“I wish I could. That would be fun. But I don’t know how to make someone 
invisible. Sorry,” he apologized. “Hey! I think we’d better get back to work here. 
This place is still a disaster.” 

Brent and I finished cleaning the room just as the front doorbell rang. 

I heard Mom answer it. A second later Roxanne burst into my room, 
carrying about a thousand books. She let them drop to the floor with a crash. 

“Hi, Sammy.” She smiled. “I came over to help you with your homework. I 



brought all my math books.” 

“Boy, am I glad you’re here!” I said. 

Roxanne smiled. “I knew you’d want my help.” 

“Not with that.” I shoved her books aside. “I want you to meet someone. 
His name is Brent—and he’s an invisible boy. And he’s here! Right in this 
room!” 

Roxanne’s eyes opened wide. “An invisible boy?” she whispered. 

“Yes!” I said. “He’s here!” 

Roxanne glanced around my room—and screamed. “I—I see him!” 

“You DO?” I asked. 

“Yes!” she repeated, pointing to my desk. “I see him. He’s standing right 
there!” 



11 


“You can see him?” I gasped, amazed. 

I faced my desk. 

I squinted. 

Stared really hard. 

I didn’t see a thing. 

Roxanne laughed. “Gotcha!” 

She gave me a not-so-friendly clap on the back, and I stumbled forward. 
“I’m tired of this dumb game.” Roxanne groaned. “Do you want to do math or 
not?” 

“But—I’m not kidding,” I insisted. “This is not a joke.” 

Roxanne dropped down on my bed and sighed. 

“I’ll prove it to you,” I told her. “Watch.” 

I gazed around my room, trying to figure out where he was. “Brent—pick 
up one of Roxanne’s books from the floor,” I said. “Show her you’re here.” 

I lowered my gaze to the floor. Wait till she sees this! I thought. She’ll 
totally freak! 

I kept my eyes glued to the pile. Waiting for one of them to float up. 

Nothing happened. 

“PLEASE, Brent,” I begged. 

I grabbed a pencil from my desk. I held it out. “Take this pencil from me. 
Make it float across the room!” 

Nothing. 

Roxanne rolled her eyes. “Please! I don’t have time for these stupid jokes, 
Sammy. Besides, it’s not funny.” 

“Brent? Hey—Brent?” 

It was no use. Brent was not going to cooperate. 

I dropped into my desk chair and threw my hands up into the air. “Thanks, 
Brent. Thanks a lot.” 

“Ready for math?” Roxanne asked. 

“No. I’m not ready,” I snapped. 

“You don’t have to yell,” she said. “Actually—I came over for another 



reason.” She slid off the bed and started collecting her math books from the 
floor. 

“I came over to see if we’re going to the haunted house Saturday night or 

not.” 

“We don’t have to go to the haunted house,” I cried. “We can do our report 
right here. Right in my room. We can do our report on Brent. Brent—The 
Invisible Kid!” 

“Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.” Roxanne started to lift her big pile of books from the 
floor. “The Invisible Kid. Right.” 

My shoulders sagged. 

“Listen, Sammy. We have to start our project. It’s going to be the best report 
in the whole class. No—it will be the best report anyone ever did in the history 
of the whole school.” 

“Can’t we talk about this tomorrow, Roxanne? I’m really not in the mood 
right now.” 

I was tired—and hungry. I hadn’t eaten anything since lunchtime. And I 
wanted to try to talk to Brent again. 

“No! We cannot talk about this tomorrow!” I could see that Roxanne was 
beginning to lose her patience. “We have to start planning now. I want to go to 
Hedge House Saturday night.” 

“What’s Hedge House?” I asked. 

Roxanne sighed loudly. “Hedge House is the haunted house. The one near 
the college. That’s what it’s called. I’ve been reading all about it.” 

Roxanne shuffled through her pile of books. “Here it is! Here’s the book 
about Hedge House. Do you want to hear some of it?” 

Do I have a choice? I asked myself. I leaned back in my chair and tried to 
pay attention. 

Roxanne stood in the middle of the room and began to read. 

“There have been many stories about the horrors of Hedge House,” she 
started. “But the true horror began when the Stilson family moved into town. 
They moved into Hedge House. No one had lived there in years—because 
everyone knew the house was haunted. 

“Tall, dark hedges grew around the house, enclosing it, sealing it off from 
curious eyes. 

“Every year, the hedges grew taller and darker, until they turned the color of 
night and shaded the highest windows. 



“The local people knew why the hedges grew that way. ‘It’s the will of the 
ghost’, they’d say. ‘To keep the house chilly and dark—as cold and icy as the 
spirit itself.’ 

“Everyone knew that—everyone but the Stilson family. 

“From the day the Stilsons moved in, the Hedge House ghost visited ten- 
year-old Jeffrey Stilson’s bedroom. The ghost visited every night. 

“‘Jef-frey,’ the ghost moaned. ‘Jef-frey — I’ve been waiting for you.’ 

“Each night, Jeffrey woke up shaking, frightened. He stared hard into the 
darkness of his room, searching for the man behind the voice. But no one was 
ever there. 

“He told his parents about the nightly visits. Told them again and again. 

“But they didn’t believe him. 

‘“Jef-frey, I’ve been waiting for you,’ the ghost’s voice returned one very 
chilly evening. ‘I need you. ’ 

“‘What do you want?’ Jeffrey cried out. ‘Tell me what you want—’ 

“At the sound of Jeffrey’s voice, the ghost appeared. 

“It was the ghost of a young man. From a time long ago. Jeffrey could tell, 
from the clothes it wore—short, baggy black pants that ended below the knees. 
Black socks pulled up high to meet the pants cuffs. And black boots with shiny 
silver buckles. 

“Jeffrey stared at the ghost. 

“He stared in horror at its black shirt. At the right sleeve that hung loosely 
at the ghost’s side. The sleeve with no arm inside. 

“ ‘Come with me, Jeffrey, ’ the ghost moaned. ‘Come with me—to learn the 
secret of this awful house.’” 

Roxanne closed the book and placed it down on the bed. 

“What’s the secret?” I demanded. “What’s the secret of Hedge House?” 

“I don’t know. I haven’t gotten to that part yet,” Roxanne said. “But I can 
tell you this. I know some people who’ve been inside Hedge House. And they 
say all kinds of spooky things happen there.” 

“Like what?” I asked. 

“Well, they say the doors open and close all by themselves,” she replied. 

I gasped—as the door behind Roxanne opened and closed by itself. 

“That’s right, Sammy,” Roxanne said. “It does make you lose your breath 
when you think about it.” 

The door opened and closed again. 



Very funny, Brent! I thought. 

“And they say the books float right off the bookshelves,” Roxanne 
continued. 

Brent began juggling three of my schoolbooks behind Roxanne’s back. 
Round and round they went, with the middle one always popping up—right over 
Roxanne’s head! 

I couldn’t help myself. I started to laugh. 

“What’s so funny, Sammy?” Roxanne frowned at me. 

I raised my hand to point behind her. But the books floated back to the 
shelf. 

I sighed. “Nothing.” 

“Good. Because this is not funny. I’m very serious about this report. I want 
it to be the best. And I want you to take great video shots to prove the ghost of 
Hedge House really exists!” 

My video camera floated up from the floor, aimed itself at Roxanne’s back 
—and I burst out laughing again. 

“SAMMY!” Roxanne jumped up angrily. “Quit it!” she shouted. “I’m going 
to strangle you if you don’t stop laughing! This report means a lot to me. It’s not 
just the grade. If I really do find the ghost, it’s going to make me famous!” 

“Huh?” I stared at her. 

Roxanne took a deep breath. Then she continued. “They say the ghost really 
hates light. They say if a light shines on him, he explodes into a rage—and 
destroys anything that is in his path.” 

I heard a soft squeak. 

I glanced around the room—and saw the light-bulb in the ceiling fixture 
turning. Turning all by itself. 

Brent is standing on my dresser, I realized. He’s unscrewing the lightbulb! 

“Roxanne, quick!” I shouted. “Look up at the ceiling! See that? Now do 
you believe me!” 



12 


“Do you see it, Roxanne?” I jumped up from my chair—really excited. Now 
Roxanne would have to believe me! 

I pointed to the lightbulb as it slowly turned in the socket—by itself! 

“See!” I shouted. “Now you believe me—right? It’s the invisible kid!” 

I spun around. I couldn’t wait to see the amazed look on her face! 

Roxanne wasn’t amazed. 

In fact, I couldn’t even see her face. 

She was kneeling down, head bent, gathering her books up from the floor. 

I glanced back up at the ceiling. The lightbulb wasn’t turning anymore. 

“Roxanne! Why didn’t you look?” I cried. “You missed it! You should have 
looked when I told you to!” 

“I should have picked a different partner,” Roxanne groaned. “I’m tired of 
your dumb jokes, Sammy!” 

I collapsed back into my desk chair. 

Roxanne balanced the stack of books in her arms and headed for the door. 
“Oh, I get it!” She whirled around to face me. “Now I understand what you’re 
doing.” 

“Huh?” 

“If you don’t want to come with me to the haunted house—just say so!” 
Roxanne said. “You don’t have to make up these stupid stories.” 

Roxanne was angry. 

I usually enjoy making Roxanne angry. But not this time. 

“An idiot,” she mumbled under her breath. “You must think I’m a total 
idiot. I’m leaving now, Sammy. I’m leaving you —and your invisible friend!” 

Then she stormed out of my room. 

“Are you still here, Brent?” I asked, searching around. 

No answer. 

I jumped up from my chair. 

“I know you’re here, Brent. Why did you do that to me?” I clenched my 
fists into two tight balls. “Why didn’t you show Roxanne that you were here?” I 
cried angrily. 



Silence. 

“Okay. Okay. I’m sorry I yelled. I didn’t really mean to yell at you, Brent. I 
just wanted Roxanne to believe me.” 

I sat back down in my chair. 

I took a deep breath. 

“Did you hear me, Brent? I said I was sorry.” 

No answer. 

“Please answer me,” I pleaded. “I want to talk to you. I want to find out 
more about you!” 

The room remained silent. 

Brent was gone. 

For good? 



13 


Did Brent really leave? 

Did he leave because I yelled at him? I wondered. 

Would he come back? 

I was still asking myself these questions on the way to school the next 
morning. 

An invisible kid. 

An invisible kid was in my room yesterday. 

Whoa! 

This was hard to believe. 

I wanted to tell Mom and Dad about Brent last night. But I wasn’t allowed 
out of my room. Even after I had cleaned it up. 

That was Simon’s fault. He told them I made him fall. So Mom and Dad 
ordered me to stay in my room all night—and think about how lucky I was to 
have a younger brother. 

That took about a second. 

The rest of the night I thought about Brent. 

What did he really want? I wondered, as the school bus rumbled toward 
school. He says he wants a friend. But should I believe him? 

I mean—a kid shows up in your room. An invisible kid. That’s pretty weird 
right there. And then he says he just wants to be your friend. 

Suddenly, I had a bad feeling about him. 

He wants something from me. I just know it. I’ve read tons of books about 
ghosts... monsters... you name it. 

And I can tell you this. They always want something. Your body. Your 
brain. Your blood. Something. 

My body. That’s it. 

That has to be it. 

Brent is a ghost who wants to fool me into being his friend—so he can take 
over my body! 

The thought made me shudder. 

Last night, I’d been too shocked—too amazed—to be frightened of him. 



But now, I had time to think. And I was really getting scared. 

Why did he come to our house? To my room? 

Maybe I can make a deal with him, I thought. Leave me alone—and I’ll 
give you my brother! 

I knew Brent wouldn’t go for that one—but it made me smile. 

I didn’t smile for long, though. 

I walked into school and stopped inside the doorway. I saw Claire, a girl 
from my class, standing by the water fountain. 

“Sure. I’ll go with you after school,” I heard her say. “Don’t worry—I’ll be 
there.” 

My mouth dropped open. 

Claire was talking—to no one. 

I walked slowly to my locker. 

A boy I knew from art class struggled with his lock. “Why can’t I get this 
thing open?” he complained. “It never got stuck before.” 

He turned to his left and said, “Okay—you do it.” 

And there was no kid standing next to him. 

He was also talking to someone invisible! 

I stared down the long hall. 

It was filled with kids. Kids talking. Kids talking to invisible kids! 

The school is filled with them! I realized to my horror. 

The school is filled with invisible people! 



14 


“Sammy!” 

I turned to see who called my name—praying I could see who it was. 

I sighed with relief. 

It was Roxanne. 

“Roxanne! You’re not going to believe—” I started. Then I stopped. 

Roxanne was grinning. 

She walked up to me and laughed right in my face. 

All the other kids in the hall began to laugh too. 

“You—you told everyone?” I sputtered. “You told everyone about the 
invisible kid in my room?” 

Roxanne tried to speak, but she couldn’t. She was doubled over, laughing 
really hard now. She nodded yes. 

“How could you do this to me?” I screeched. 

“Calm down.” Roxanne patted me on the shoulder. “It was just a joke. You 
have to admit we all did a good job of keeping a straight face.” 

“Ha ha,” I said weakly. I didn’t think it was the least bit funny. I’m going to 
get Roxanne for this, I promised myself. I don’t know how—but I will. 

I headed into my classroom with my head down and took my seat quickly. 

The other kids piled into the room. Some of them were still laughing. When 
they saw me, they pretended to talk to invisible people again. 

My face turned red. 

“Everyone is so chatty this morning!” Ms. Starkling noted. “Time to settle 
down. Please take out your homework.” 

“Oh, no,” I groaned. 

I didn’t do my homework last night. I’d forgotten all about it. 

I glanced around the room. 

I was the only one without the assignment. 

“Please pass your homework to the front of the room,” Ms. Starkling said. 

Claire sat in front of me. She waited for me to pass my homework to her 
before she passed hers up. 

I tapped her on the shoulder. “I don’t have it,” I whispered. 



“Uh-oh,” she said. “Did the invisible boy eat it?” Everyone around me 
giggled. 

“Quiet down, class,” Ms. Starkling warned. She collected all the 
homework, then told us to open our math books. 

Ms. Starkling wrote an equation on the board. “Sammy, are you feeling 
better today?” she asked when she finished. 

I nodded yes. 

I mean—what else could I say? No. Ms. Starkling, Em not feeling better. I 
met an invisible kid last night in my room—and now no one will ever believe me. 
Everyone thinks I’m crazy. 

“Good,” Ms. Starkling said. “Would you please come up and show the class 
how to solve this?” 

I couldn’t catch a break today. 

I stood up. 

“Not you, Sammy,” Ms. Starkling said. “I was talking to him.” 

She pointed to the seat next to me. 

The empty seat next to me. 

I glanced up at Ms. Starkling, puzzled. 

“Your invisible friend,” she said. 

That sent the whole class into a new fit of laughter. 

Ms. Starkling laughed. “Sorry, Sammy. I had to get in on the joke too.” 

Sorry? I knew she wasn’t sorry. She was laughing too hard. 

I was so embarrassed. Totally humiliated. 

And that was just the beginning of the day. The afternoon was much worse. 

At lunch period, I went to the library. I took a seat by myself. 

I didn’t want to hear any more invisible boy jokes. 

I didn’t want to talk to anyone. 

I took my tuna sandwich out of my backpack. I placed it on my lap so Ms. 
Pinsky, the librarian, wouldn’t see it. We’re not supposed to eat in the library, 
and I didn’t want to get caught. 

Everyone in school knows that when the librarian gets angry—watch out. I 
remember when Claire made her angry. Ms. Pinsky made Claire write a hundred 
book reports, three pages each! That was last year—but Claire is still writing the 
reports. I think she’s only up to book number twenty. 

I unwrapped the sandwich—and gasped. 

The sandwich began to rise up. 



“Brent—put it down!” I whispered. “What are you doing here?” 

A bite disappeared from the sandwich. 

“I was lonely in your room, all by myself,” Brent said. “And hungry.” 
Another bite of my sandwich vanished. 

I snatched the sandwich away from him. I glanced nervously around the 
room. “You can’t stay here. You have to leave!” 

“Please, let me stay,” Brent begged. “It’s no fun at home without you. I 
need a friend.” 

“Everyone thinks I’m nuts!” My voice started to rise. “Totally NUTS! All 
the kids in school are laughing at me. Even my teacher is making fun of me! You 
can’t stay here, Brent. You can’t—” 

A shadow fell over the table. 

I glanced up. 

The librarian stood over me, frowning and shaking her head. 



15 


“Ssssammy!” she hissed. “Who are you talking to? And why are you talking in 
the library?” 

I gulped. 

Her eyes narrowed into two angry slits. She clenched her lips tightly 
together. 

Then she glanced down at my lap and gasped. “Is that... FOOD?” 

I’m doomed, I realized. I’ll be writing book reports for the rest of my life. 
Thanks, Brent. Thanks a lot. 

“Sammy! How could you?” the librarian exclaimed. “You’ve broken my 
two most important rules!” 

I grabbed onto my seat, waiting for her to really let me have it. But she 
didn’t. 

“This is so unlike you,” she said. Her voice grew kinder. “Would you like to 
talk to the guidance counselor after school today? You know, talking to yourself 
is a sign that you are troubled by something.” 

I glanced around the library—at everyone gaping at me. I could feel my 
face turning hot. I knew I was blushing. 

“No, I’m fine,” I insisted. 

“If something is bothering you—it’s nothing to be ashamed of.” The 
librarian took a seat next to me. 

Now everyone started to whisper. 

I wanted to disappear. 

“Nothing is troubling me. Really,” I insisted, shoving my sandwich back in 
my backpack. 

“Maybe you should have a chat with the guidance counselor anyway,” she 
continued. “I’m sure you’ll find Ms. Turnbull very easy to talk to. I’ll tell her 
you are going to stop by.” 

The librarian was not going to give up. 

“I can’t see Ms. Turnbull after school today. I’m in the relay race in the 
Olympics,” I said. “I can’t miss the race. My whole team is depending on me!” 

“Okay.” The librarian stood up to leave. “But will you promise me 
something?” 



Sure, I thought. I’ll promise you anything—as long as you leave. NOW. 

I nodded yes. 

“I want you to come and see me if anything is bothering you. Will you do 
that?” She patted me on the shoulder. 

I nodded again—and she went back to her desk. 

I slowly glanced around—to see if everyone was still staring at me. 

They weren’t. 

They were all busy talking. Talking to invisible friends. And laughing. 

I shaded my eyes from the sun. It beamed down brightly on the track field. 

The sky was a deep blue. 

The air felt warm. Nice. Not too hot. 

A perfect day for a race. 

I peered into the bleachers. They spilled over with kids from all the schools 
in town. 

More kids arrived, trying to push their way into seats. But the bleachers 
were packed. Kids shouted and shoved and laughed and joked. Everyone seemed 
totally wired. 

My team gathered at one end of the field. I jogged over to them. 

“Hey! Sammy!” Roxanne greeted me and slapped me a high five. “Great 
day for a race! I know we’re going to win—I can feel it!” And then she added, 
“Unless you mess up.” 

“You don’t have to worry about me, Roxanne. I can outrun you any day,” I 
shot back. 

I ran a practice lap around the field. I ran fast and strong. I was pumped up. 
I felt totally confident. 

Three of us were going to run the relay race. 

Jed would start. Jed is a great runner. He’s tall and skinny and can take 
really long strides. 

I would run next. Then Roxanne would finish up. 

The three of us were the fastest runners in the whole seventh grade. 

We couldn’t lose. 

The race was about to begin. I jumped up and down to keep my muscles 
warm. 

I glanced up into the stands—and saw some kids pointing at me. Some of 
them laughed. 



“Oh, noooo,” I moaned. I know what they’re talking about. My invisible 
friend. 

After this race, you are going to keep a promise you made this morning, I 
told myself. You are going to pay Roxanne back—no matter what it takes. 

All my muscles tensed up. 

“Relax. Relax,” I repeated over and over, bending forward and rubbing my 
leg muscles. 

“Ready, Sammy?” Jed high-fived me. “We’re counting on you!” 

“Ready!” I said. 

But I couldn’t stop thinking about the kids in the bleachers—the ones who 
laughed every time they looked at me. 

And I couldn’t stop thinking about Ms. Starkling—and how she made fun 
of me. 

And I couldn’t stop thinking about the librarian—who thought I was totally 

nuts. 

My muscles tightened even more. 

I concentrated hard. Concentrated on shoving all those thoughts out of my 
mind. 

I did some warm-up exercises. My muscles began to loosen up. I started to 
feel better. 

The referee took his place on the field. 

Jed, Roxanne, and I lined up in race order. 

The six teams from the other schools were ready too. We all waited for the 
referee’s signal. As soon as he blew his whistle, the first runner would run 
around the track once—then pass the baton to the next runner. 

I trained my eyes on the referee. My heart pounded. I took a deep breath. 
Then another. 

The whistle blew. 

The race was on! 

Cheers rang out as Jed took off! He ran faster than I’d ever seen him run 
before. Amazing! 

Roxanne and I cheered him on. “Go, Jed! Gooooo!” 

Jed reached the halfway mark before any of the other runners. 

He raced to the finish. Practically flying now. Holding out the baton. 
Holding it out so I could grab it—and run. 

I could hear his sneakers pounding the ground. Dust flew up behind him. 



His face was red. His eyes were wide. 

He was only a few feet away from me. 

I dropped into my racing position. 

I stuck out my hand. Jed stretched out his arm. I grabbed the baton from 
him. The cheers in the bleachers rose to a roar. Here I go! I thought. RUN! 



16 


My shoes pounded the track. I swung my arms hard, gripping the baton in my 
right hand. 

I took long strides, leaning forward, building a rhythm. Faster. Faster than 
I’d ever run. 

The cheers thundered in my ears. “Go, Sammy! Go! Go! Go!” 

That made me run even harder. 

It felt so awesome! 

Without slowing down, I glanced over my shoulder. 

I was way ahead of all the other runners. 

I reached the halfway mark—and sprinted forward. We were going to win 
this race! Yes! 

The three-quarter mark was coming up—and I wasn’t even out of breath. 
The other runners were struggling, still way behind. 

I leaned forward. Pounded the hard track. 

And gasped when I felt a hand grab my shoulder. 

Another hand grabbed my waist. 

“Hey—!” I cried. 

And then I realized what was happening. 

“Brent—get away! What are you doing?” I wailed. 

“I’m going to help you win!” he cried breathlessly. “I’m going to show you 
I’m your friend! Watch!” 

Before I knew what was happening— 

Before I could stop him— 

My feet lifted up off the ground—and I started to fly! 



17 


“No! Stop! Put me down! Put me down!” I shrieked. 

He ignored my cries. He raised me off the ground. 

I flew about a foot. And felt Brent stumble. 

“Let go! Let go!” I screamed. 

I waved my arms wildly, trying to regain my balance. I kicked my legs, 
trying to break free of Brent’s grasp. 

I let out an angry cry as I fell to the track. 

I landed hard on my knees and elbows. Then my head banged down on the 
sharp cinders. 

The baton flew from my hand. I gazed up—and watched in horror as it 
rolled across the field. 

“Ohhhhh.” 

“Sorry, Sammy,” Brent cried from close by. “I only wanted to help. But I 
tripped.” 

I looked up—in time to see the other runners racing by me. 

We were going to lose. Big time. 

I raised my eyes to Roxanne and Jed. They glared back at me. They shook 
their fists angrily at me. 

I sat up. My elbows were scraped raw. My knees were bleeding. 

“Brent! How could you do this to me?” I wailed. 

“I was only trying to help,” he repeated. 

Another runner raced by me. His sneakers kicked up a chunk of cinders and 
mud. SPLAT —into my eyes. 

I felt a hand trying to wipe the mud away. 

I swung out my arm and shoved Brent hard. 

“Ow!” he cried. “Hey—why do you have to be a sore loser? Winning isn’t 
everything, you know.” 

With my head down, I shuffled off the field. As I walked by the bleachers, 
some kids from my school booed me. 

I got some cheers too—mostly from kids on the other teams. 

I could feel Jed’s and Roxanne’s burning glares as I made my way over to 



them. 

Jed didn’t say a word. I think he was too angry to speak. 

Roxanne didn’t have that problem. 

“How could you—you stupid clumsy cretin!” she shrieked. “We could have 
won! You blew it. You really blew it this time!” 

“It wasn’t my fault!” I cried. “It was the invisible kid!” 

Ugh. Wrong thing to say. 

“I wish you were invisible! ” Roxanne cried in disgust. 

I wish I were invisible too, I thought. This has to be the most awful day of 
my life. 

Brent is ruining my life. 

Maybe having an invisible friend would be fun for another kid. But it was 
definitely not fun for me. 

I have to do something about Brent, I decided. 

I have to do something right away. 



18 


“Come on, Sammy. Be a good sport. Measure me.” Simon shoved a tape 
measure in my face. 

“I told you, Simon. You haven’t grown since yesterday! Now—leave me 
alone.” 

I had just returned home from the worst day of my life. I definitely was not 
in the mood to measure Simon. 

“My project is a loser.” Simon lowered his eyes. “A total loser.” 

It was hard not to feel sorry for Simon. He was so serious about his science 
project. 

I tried to cheer him up. “Simon, we just don’t grow that fast,” I said. 
“Maybe you should study something else. How about measuring a puppy? 
Puppies grow faster than we do. Much faster.” 

“But we don’t have a puppy,” Simon replied. 

“How about Brutus? You can measure Brutus,” I said, guiding Simon out of 
my bedroom. 

“Brutus isn’t going to grow any more,” Simon whined. “You know that. 
He’s too old.” 

“I’ll think about it,” I told him. “I’ll try to come up with something you can 
study. But I need to think—alone.” 

I gave Simon a soft shove out of my room. Then I closed the door. 

I flopped down on my bed. And pulled the covers over my head. 

I wanted to disappear. 

I couldn’t face anyone—not Roxanne, not my teacher, not the librarian. Not 
the whole seventh grade. 

I heard a noise. 

I whipped off the blanket—and saw my window sliding up. “Phew. Why is 
it so hot in here?” a familiar voice demanded. 

“Oh, noooo,” I groaned. “You’re back?” 

“Lighten up, Sammy. Why don’t we go out and play some ball or 
something? Take your mind off things. I’m a really good pitcher.” 

“Brent—you have to leave.” 

“Good idea. Let’s leave this stuffy house. We’ll go out. Get a pizza. I’m 



hungry,” he said. “You must be hungry too.” 

“I mean it. You have to go,” I said softly. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. I 
just wanted him to go. 

“But I don’t want to leave,” Brent replied. “I want to be your best friend. I 
really do.” 

“I can’t be your best friend,” I told him. “It’s not working out.” 

“Just give it a chance,” he insisted. “We’re going to have a great time 
together. You’ll see....” 

“Sammy! Time for dinner!” Mom called up the steps. 

“I’m going downstairs to eat,” I told Brent. “And when I come back—” 

“Don’t worry, I’ll still be here,” he said cheerfully. 

He’s never going to leave, I realized as I headed down for dinner. Never. 
What am I going to do? How am I going to get rid of him? 

There was only one thing to do. 

I took my seat at the dinner table. “Mom. Dad. I have something important 
to tell you.” 

My parents gazed up from their plates. 

I took a deep breath while they waited for me to go on. 

“There’s an invisible kid in my room—and I need your help. I have to get 
rid of him!” 

I had to tell Mom and Dad. 

I didn’t know what else to do. 

Mom and Dad were really smart—for parents. They were scientists, after 
all. They’d know how to get rid of Brent. 

“Not now, Sammy,” Mom said impatiently. “Your father and I had a very 
hard day today. We worked for hours on the Molecule Detector Light—and it’s 
still not working properly.” 

She sighed. “After dinner we’re going down to the basement to work on it 
some more. So eat quickly. We don’t have time for your wild stories.” 

I felt a kick under the table. “Cut it out, Simon.” I glared at my brother. 

“It wasn’t me.” Simon smirked. “It was the invisible kid!” 

Great. Simon, the serious mutant, is trying to be funny. 

I kicked Simon back. 

“Hey—that hurt!” he whined. 

“It wasn’t my fault. Your legs are in the way. They must be growing. Quick! 
Measure them!” I snickered. 



“Ha ha.” Simon rolled his eyes. “Is the invisible kid as funny as you are?” 
He kicked me again. 

“Simon—” I started. 

“Cut it out, you two!” Dad shouted. 

I turned to Dad. “But there really is an invisible kid. You’ve got to believe 
me. I need your help.” 

“Not tonight,” Dad groaned. “Please. Your mom and I had such a terrible 

day.” 

I tried again. “He could be dangerous. He’s upstairs and—” 

“Sammy—not another word. I mean it,” Dad said. “No more crazy stories.” 
So much for smart parents. 

Now what am I going to do? I wondered as Mom placed our dinner on the 
table. I’ve got to get rid of Brent. But how? 

All through dinner, I thought and thought. And by the time Mom served 
dessert, I had an idea! 



19 


“Brent? Are you here?” 

I held out a few pieces of chicken wrapped in a napkin. It was easy 
sneaking it out of the dining room. 

Mom and Dad talked about work all through dinner. Light refraction. 
Frequency waves. The usual stuff. They didn’t pay any attention to me. 

And Simon was too busy worrying about his science project. He was still 
the same size. He even measured his fingernails, but they hadn’t grown, either. 

When no one was looking, I wrapped the chicken in my napkin and placed 
it in my lap—and Brutus wailed. 

Brutus loves chicken. 

He tried to jump into my lap. 

He clawed at the napkin. 

He wailed some more. 

“Can’t you do something about that cat?” Mom asked. “Your father and I 
can’t think.” 

“Come on, Brutus.” I shoved the napkin under my T-shirt. “Let’s go 
upstairs.” 

I jumped up from my chair and waved for Brutus to follow me. He let out a 
sharp cry—and ran in the other direction. 

Wow! Brutus knows! I realized. Brutus knows that something weird is 
upstairs in my room. 

I bet that’s why he won’t sleep in my room anymore! 

I hurried to my room and held out the chicken. “Brent—aren’t you 
hungry?” I stood in one spot. I turned in a circle, holding out the chicken. 

“I’m starving. Thanks. Thanks a lot.” I felt a light tug as Brent took the 
food from my hand. 

I watched the napkin unfold by itself. 

“Mmmm. Fried chicken.” A big bite disappeared. “This is excellent. Your 
mom is a great cook! Thanks.” 

“Roxanne’s mom is a great cook too,” I said. “Better than my mom. Much 
better. I eat at Roxanne’s house all the time. Whenever I can.” 

Brent kept on eating. 



“You should eat at Roxanne’s. You’d see what I mean.” 

Brent kept on eating. 

“Hey! I just thought of a great idea!” I said. “You should be Roxanne’s best 
friend. Roxanne needs a ghost for our school project. You could be the ghost! 
That would make Roxanne so happy! She would have a ghost right in her own 
house. And you’d be happy too—eating all that great food! Come on! I can take 
you over there right now!” 

Brent stopped eating. 

“I am not going to Roxanne’s house,” he declared. “She’s a girl. I don’t 
want to be a girl’s best friend. I want to be your best friend. And I already told 
you—I am not a ghost.” 

The empty napkin floated toward me. “Is there any more chicken?” he 
asked. “I’m still hungry! And how about some dessert?” 

I sat down on my bed and waited for Brent to finish his second helping of 
chicken and the bowl of ice cream I sneaked upstairs for him. 

Then I tried again. “Brent, you have to leave. You have to go.” 

“But I want to be your best friend!” he insisted. “I’m never leaving. 
NEVER!” 

“Don’t you get it? I don’t want you to be my friend,” I told him. “I have 
plenty of friends—at least I did, until you came along.” 

I stood up and paced back and forth across my room. “You are ruining my 
life,” I said. “I want you to leave. I want you to get out of my house and never 
come back!” 

Silence. 

“Do you hear me?” 

More silence. 

“I know you’re here, Brent. Answer me!” 

“Please—can we talk later?” he finally replied. “I’m way tired. I need to get 
some rest.” 

The covers on my bed began to fold down. Then an invisible hand punched 
the pillow. 

“Ahhhh,” Brent sighed. “Your bed is so great!” 

That’s when I lost it. “We cannot talk later. We have to talk now. I want you 
to get out!” I screamed. “NOW!” 

“Really?” Brent’s voice changed. Deeper—and meaner. A lot meaner. 



“Y-yes. Really,” I stammered. 

“And what if I won’t go?” he asked. 

I took a step back—away from the bed. 

I didn’t like the way Brent said that. It sounded like a threat. 

“Well, Sammy—what if I won’t go?” he repeated menacingly. 

I took another step back—and felt a hot hand clamp down on my shoulder. 
I tried to break free—but I couldn’t. He was too strong. 

Brent grabbed my arm. He held it tightly. 

“Leave me alone!” I shouted. “Let me go!” 

But he started to pull me—toward the open window! 



20 


What did he plan to do? 

Push me out the window? 

“Stop! Let go! Hey—let go!” I shot my arms up—and broke free. 

“Sorry,” Brent muttered. “I was just goofing. You know. Good friends 
wrestle sometimes—right? Just for fun?” 

“Fun?” I cried weakly. My heart pounded in my chest. 

He’s dangerous, I realized. 

I don’t think he was kidding around. I think he wanted to shove me out the 
window. 

Frightened, I turned and started to run to the door. But I stumbled over his 
invisible feet and fell hard to the floor. 

Before I could scramble up, I felt his strong hands grab me again. 

“Let go!” I screeched, my voice high and shrill in panic. 

“I was just trying to help you up,” Brent said. 

His hands released me. 

I rubbed my sore wrists. 

“Really. I was just helping you up,” Brent insisted. “You believe me, don’t 
you? Say you believe me.” 

“Okay. Okay,” I grumbled. “I believe you.” 

“Great!” Brent cheered. 

“But you still have to leave,” I told him. “Everyone already thinks I’m too 
weird. I can’t have an invisible boy following me around, talking to me, living in 
my bedroom. Now go. Really. I mean it.” 

“But I can help you,” Brent cried. “I helped you already—with that math 
equation.” 

“Oh, yeah. You helped me all right.” I started pacing my room again. “You 
helped me look like a total geek in front of all my friends—and my teacher.” I 
winced just thinking about it. 

“Okay. I made a mistake. One little mistake,” Brent said. 

“ONE little mistake!” My voice started to rise. “What about in the library 
today? Now the librarian thinks I’m totally crazy. She wants me to see the 



guidance counselor!” 

I couldn’t help myself. I was yelling at him now. “And what about the track 
race? You ruined everything! You made me fall and lose the race. You made me 
disappoint everyone.” 

“Sorry,” Brent said softly. “I thought I could help you win. I just wanted to 
give you a boost.” 

“A boost?” I screamed. “You—you—” 

My closet door opened. 

My new, dark-blue Yankees baseball jacket floated out. “Hey—cool 
jacket!” Brent exclaimed. “I think the sleeves are too long, though. I don’t think 
it will fit me.” 

The jacket slid off the hanger. 

“Give that to me!” I snatched the jacket out of the air. “Now—leave! I don’t 
want you here.” 

“Sammy—who on earth are you yelling at?” Mom stood in my bedroom 
doorway. 

“The invisible kid!” I cried. “He’s here! He’s right here! You’ve got to 
believe me! Brent—say something!” 

Silence. 

“PLEASE, Brent!” I begged. 

Nothing. 

Mom walked over to me slowly, staring at me, shaking her head. She placed 
a hand on my forehead. “You don’t seem to have a fever.” 

“I’m not sick, Mom. I’m fine. Really. And I’m telling the truth.” 

“I don’t know...” Her voice trailed off. Then she studied me carefully. 
“Where are you going?” she asked. 

“I’m not going anywhere,” I said. 

“Then why are you holding your jacket?” 

I stared down at the jacket. “Oh, I just wanted to see if it still fits,” I lied. I 
mean—what else could I say now? 

“Of course it still fits. We bought it for you last week.” Mom stared hard at 
me. She placed her hand on my forehead again. “I don’t know,” she repeated. 
“You haven’t been yourself lately.” 

She glanced at my jacket again. Then she shook her head some more. “Now 
tell me—who were you shouting at?” 

“Uh... no one. I was just rehearsing my lines... for the school play.” 



“You’re in the school play?” she asked. 

“Uh... no. Not exactly,” I said. “I’m rehearsing... in case they ask me to be 
in it.” 

“Sammy, if something is bothering you—you know you can always tell me 
about it. Right?” 

“Right,” I said. 

Mom felt my forehead for the third time. She shook her head—again. She 
started for the door—and stopped. 

“Your father and I have been working very hard. I know we haven’t been 
paying much attention to you. But that’s going to change now. We’re going to be 
here for you. In fact, we’re going to be watching you very closely.” 

Great. 

Mom and Dad were going to start studying me—like one of their science 
projects. 

“It’s way too chilly in here, Sammy.” Mom walked over to my window and 
closed it. Then she left the room. 

“Are you still here, Brent?” I snapped. 

“Yes.” 

“Why did you do that to me? Why wouldn’t you speak to my mother?” I 
demanded. 

“Sorry,” Brent said. “But I don’t want anyone else to know about me. I just 
want to live with you and be your friend.” 

“Well, that’s not going to happen,” I replied sharply. 

I suddenly felt hopeful. Because Mom had just given me a great idea! 

Now I knew exactly what I had to do—to get rid of the invisible boy. 



21 


I ran straight across the hall to the bathroom. I turned the hot-water faucet in the 
shower up all the way. 

Yes! A few seconds later, the mirror started to cloud with steam. Then I 
turned on the hot water in the sink—and in the bathtub too. 

Wow. Was it hot in here! Hotter than a tropical rain forest, I thought. 

Excellent! 

I wiped the sweat from my forehead and raced back into my room. I made 
sure the window was closed tightly. Then I opened the valve on my radiator. I 
kept turning it—until I heard the loud hiss of steam escape into my room. 

Perspiration dripped from my face as the moist, warm air from the 
bathroom drifted into my room. 

“Sammy, what are you doing?” Brent wailed. “It’s too hot in here!” 

I laughed. “Sorry. But this is the way I like it!” 

I raced down the hall and opened the valve on Mom and Dad’s radiator, 
then Simon’s radiator too. I made sure all their windows were shut tight. 

“Sammy, stop!” Brent begged. “It’s too hot! Too hot!” 

I sat in my bed—and waited. 

Beads of sweat formed on my upper lip. My T-shirt, drenched with sweat, 
clung to me. 

Perfect! 

“I—I can’t take it anymore.” Brent’s voice started to grow faint. “I—I can’t 
stay here. It’s... too... hot.” 

Over his low cries, I heard my window slide up. 

And I knew that my plan had worked. Brent was gone—for good. 



22 


On Saturday night, Roxanne and I had planned to go to the movies to see School 
Spirit. But the plan had changed. Roxanne insisted that if I didn’t go to Hedge 
House with her, she’d never speak to me again. 

I believed her. 

“Can you walk a little faster?” Roxanne asked. “It’s getting cold out here.” 

She was right. A heavy fog had settled in. And a strong wind began to blow. 

I shivered in the damp night air. 

We walked quickly, down block after block. “We’re almost there,” Roxanne 
said as we neared the next corner. “Are you ready?” 

I shrugged. “Sure.” 

“Good.” Roxanne stopped. “We’re here.” 

Whoa! I peered up—at the highest, darkest hedges I had ever seen. A wall 
of hedges so thick you couldn’t even see through it! 

“I—I’ve never seen hedges grow so high before,” I stammered. 

“‘It’s the will of the ghost. To keep the house chilly and dark—as cold and 
icy as the spirit itself.’” Roxanne smiled. “I memorized that part from the book I 
read to you.” 

“How do we get in?” I asked, searching for a way through the tall shmbs. 

“You’re lucky you have me for a partner,” Roxanne sighed. “You don’t 
know anything.” 

We walked along the dark hedges until we came to a small opening. I 
peeked inside—and there stood Hedge House. Three stories high, tall and 
narrow, with lots of windows—most of them shattered. Sharp shards of glass 
poked up from the frames. 

Wow! The hedges did grow as tall as the highest windows—just as the book 
said. The shingles on the outside of the house were blackened and rotted with 
age. 

A strong gust of wind blew. 

The hedge tops beat against the pointed roof—and sent a loose shingle 
hurtling through the air. 

Roxanne and I jumped back—just in time. 

I could see Roxanne shiver. 



This house was really creepy! 

“If you’re scared, we don’t have to go in,” I told her. “We can still go see 
the movie.” 

“Me? Scared? Have you totally lost it?” she snapped. “Let’s go!” 

Roxanne headed up the broken stone steps to the front door. I followed right 
behind her. 

She walked up onto the wooden porch. “Be careful,” she said, glancing 
back at me. “These planks are kind of wobbly.” 

She reached out for the front door. She slowly turned the doorknob. 

The door swung open with a creak—and we stepped inside. 



23 


We stood in a large entrance hall. 

A fancy chandelier hung from the ceiling directly over our heads. Crystals 
in the shape of teardrops dangled from it. Crystals draped in a thick layer of dust 
and cobwebs. 

It felt icy cold in here. Much colder than outside. A sour odor rose up to 
greet us. 

I shivered. I groped for a light switch, and found one on the wall next to the 

door. 

I flicked the switch—but nothing happened. 

“It’s not going to work!” Roxanne whispered. “Nobody has lived here for 
years! Turn on your flashlight.” 

“What flashlight?” I asked. 

“You didn’t bring a flashlight? You were supposed to bring a flashlight,” 
she whispered. 

“I forgot,” I admitted. 

Roxanne sighed. “Did you bring the camcorder?” she demanded. 

“Yes, it’s right here.” I pulled the video camera out of my backpack. 

“At least you remembered something,” she muttered. She started to say 
something else. But instead, a cry escaped her lips. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked. 

“Didn’t you hear something—like a low moan?” she asked, excited. 

“No,” I told her. “I didn’t hear anything.” 

“Oh,” she said. “Well, we just got here. I bet we hear moaning soon. Make 
sure your camcorder is ready.” 

We stepped forward—into the living room. Into a cold white mist. 

“I can’t see a thing,” I whispered. “How did the living room get so foggy?” 

“Look.” Roxanne pointed to one of the walls where the fog came seeping 
through the cracks. It entered in narrow streams, then billowed and swirled, 
filling the room. 

I took another step—and the wind howled outside. 

Something white flew at me. 



I jumped back—then realized it was just the curtains. Filmy, white curtains 
flapping over the broken front windows. Flapping hard. 

Another gust blew. Stronger this time. It drove the streams of fog through 
the cracks. 

“There’s nothing in here,” I said. Another shiver ran through me. “Let’s go 
upstairs.” 

Roxanne led the way through the dining room and kitchen before we 
headed toward the steps. Both rooms were empty. Cold and empty. 

We walked down a long hallway. At the end of the hallway we found the 
staircase. The old, wood banister was badly splintered. Parts of it were missing 
completely. 

“Ready?” Roxanne groped the wall as she started up. 

I whispered “yes,” but I wasn’t so sure. I mean—I really didn’t think this 
house was haunted. But it was so dark, and damp, and foggy, and empty.... 
Anyone would be a little scared in here! 

As we climbed the staircase, the steps groaned under our feet. The air grew 
colder. 

At the top of the stairs we faced three doors. We peered into each doorway. 
Into small, dark rooms. 

I let out a relieved sigh when I saw they were all empty. 

We climbed the stairs to the third floor. It took us into a large room. This 
one wasn’t empty. 

Shredded clothing and torn blankets lay scattered on the floor. Three 
pillows sat propped against a wall—slashed, with the stuffing spilling out. 

A toppled wooden chair leaned against an old trunk. 

Roxanne crossed the darkened room and headed for the trunk. 

I kneeled down and studied a piece of black, crumpled material on the floor. 
I picked it up—and gasped. 

It was a black shirt—a black shirt with the right sleeve missing! Just like in 
the ghost story! 

“Let’s check out the trunk,” Roxanne whispered. 

“No! Look at this—” I started, then stopped—as a frightening moan drifted 
up the steps. 

We spun around to face the staircase—and gasped as the steps began to 
creak and groan. 

Footsteps! 



Roxanne’s mouth gaped open. 

My heart began to pound in my chest. 

Roxanne turned to me, but I peered down quickly so she wouldn’t see how 
frightened I was. 

“The—the ghost—is here,” she stammered. “It’s coming! Get the 
camcorder ready.” 

I fumbled for the power switch. It shook as I raised it up in my trembling 
hands. 

The footsteps reached the top of the stairs. 

Roxanne stood in the center of the room—frozen in fear. 

A deep, eerie moan filled the room. Followed by a shrill laugh. 

Then the chair flew across the room. And the lid of the trunk shot open. 

Roxanne leaped back. She took out her notebook and began scribbling 
notes. She was excited—and scared. Her pencil shook as she wrote. 

The lid of the trunk slammed down hard. We both jumped. 

I watched in horror as the chair began to rise up off the floor. It hovered in 
midair, then came down with a loud crash. 

“Don’t just stand there!” Roxanne screamed at me. “The camcorder! The 
camcorder! Get it on video!” 

I lifted the video camera—and the pillows soared through the room. 

The blankets came alive. They seemed to hurl themselves at us. They 
wrapped around our bodies. 

“Yuck!” I cried out. They smelled so sour, so rotten. 

The blankets spun us around like toy tops. Then they dropped to the floor. 

The trunk lid opened and banged closed—again and again. 

The windows slid up and crashed down. 

“It’s a ghost!” Roxanne exclaimed happily. “A real ghost! Do you believe 
it? We’re definitely going to get an A! Let me have that!” 

She grabbed my video camera. And peered through the viewfinder. 

“Noooooooo!” A terrified howl escaped her throat. She dropped the camera. 
It clattered to the floor. 

“Help me, Sammy!” she screamed. “It’s got me! It’s got me!” 



24 


“Let me go!” Roxanne shrieked. “Sammy—help! It’s got me! The ghost—it’s 
pulling me!” 

I gaped in horror as Roxanne’s jacket flew up behind her, tugged by an 
invisible, ghostly hand. 

Her whole body jerked as the ghost pulled—and sent her stumbling across 
the room. 

She tripped and fell to her knees. 

“Owww!” She uttered a terrified cry. Scrambled to her feet, her eyes wide 
with fright. 

I suddenly remembered the camcorder. I’ve got to get this on tape! I told 
myself. I raised the camera. 

Roxanne’s jacket flew out behind her again. “Ohhh—help!” she cried. 

She began to spin in a circle. Round and round. Faster and faster. Whirling 
helplessly, her arms flying up, her hair spinning out behind her head. 

I tried to hold the camcorder steady, but I couldn’t. 

“Drop that stupid camera—and help me! ” Roxanne shrieked as she whirled 
around the room. 

“Get away from her!” I yelled. “Leave her alone!” 

To my shock, Roxanne stopped spinning. Her knees buckled. She fell 
against the wall. Hit hard with a loud THUD. 

“Oh.” She shook her head as if trying to shake away her fear. “The Ghost of 
Hedge House—” she started. 

But before she could finish her sentence, she floated up from the floor. 

“No—please!” Roxanne begged, thrashing her arms wildly, kicking her 
legs. “LET ME DOWN! LET ME DOWN!” 

The ghost must have let go. Because Roxanne slid to the floor. She landed 
on her knees. 

Before she could climb up, a pillow floated from the floor. I stared in shock 
as it pressed itself over Roxanne’s face. 

She uttered a muffled cry. “Help—I can’t breathe! The ghost—he’s 
smothering me!” 

“Nooooo!” A cry tore from my throat as I dove across the room to 



Roxanne. 

“Nooooo!” With a desperate grab, I ripped the pillow away. “Go haunt 
someone else!” I screamed. 

Roxanne dropped to the floor. 

I tossed the pillow away and started toward her. But a cold hand tightened 
around my arm. “Jeffrey — I’ve been waiting for you,” a hoarse voice rasped. 

The Ghost of Hedge House! 

It talked! It talked to me! 

“I—I’m not Jeffrey!” I choked out. 

“Jeffrey — I’ve been waiting for you!” he moaned again. 

Then I felt myself being lifted off the floor. 

Before I could struggle free, the ghost jerked me back and forth—back and 
forth—so hard I thought my neck would snap. 

I wanted to scream. I wanted to fight back. 

But his grip was so strong. I felt so helpless.... 

A sour-smelling blanket rose up and wrapped itself tightly around me. I 
couldn’t move my hands or legs! 

I kicked and squirmed—struggling against the rotted fabric. And finally 
dropped facedown on the floor. 

A shrill laugh rang through the room. 

Roxanne and I staggered to our feet. We headed for the stairs. 

The ghost followed after us, moaning. “Jeffrey — I’ve been waiting for you. 
Jeffrey—come back! I’ve waited so long!” 

We reached the second-floor landing—and the ghost grabbed me from 
behind. “I’ve got you now, Jef-frey!” came his raspy whisper. “I’ve waited so 
long in this old house. So long...” 

His cold hands circled my neck. 

He tightened his grip. I couldn’t breathe! 

“I’m... not... Jeffrey,” I choked out. 

My last words. 



25 


I thought they were my last words. 

Everything flared bright red. The dark room spun and tilted behind the 
swirling red. 

Stars flashed in my eyes. So white and bright, my head ached. I tried to 
blink them away. 

And they faded to black. Everything faded to black. 

The Ghost of Hedge House had another victim. 

But no. 

Not quite. 

A hand grabbed mine. Pulled me. Pulled me from the darkness. 

“Sammy—come on!” Roxanne pleaded in a terrified whisper. “Come on! 
You’re okay! You’re okay!” 

And before I realized it, she had pulled me free. And we were running 
again. Running down the stairs. Through the misty living room. Out the door. 
And into the cold night. 

Breathing the air. The cool, sweet air. 

Breathing and running. 

Alive! 

Yes! Alive! Leaving the Ghost of Hedge House behind. And running. 
Running and breathing. 

The air never smelled so good. The night never looked so beautiful. 
Roxanne ran straight to her house. I watched her throw open her front door. 
She flew inside and slammed the door behind her. 

I jogged the rest of the way to my house. Burst breathlessly inside. And 
checked the front door twice to make sure it was locked. 

My legs trembling, my whole body vibrating, shaking— alive !—I ran up the 
stairs to my room. 

I sat down on my bed—and screamed in terror. Screamed at the black shirt 
draped on my pillow. 

The black shirt of the one-armed ghost! 



26 


“It’s only a shirt,” a voice said calmly. “What’s your problem?” 

I jumped to my feet—and saw a plate hovering in the air. And a sandwich 
vanishing, bite by bite. 

Brent! 

“Didn’t I do a great job?” Brent asked between bites. “Don’t I make an 
awesome ghost?” 

I saw my desk chair slide out. “That was hard work!” he sighed. “Boy, am I 
tired!” 

“You?” I shrieked. “That was you?” 

“I know. I know. I was awesome,” he said. “Jef-frey —I’ve been waiting for 
you!” Then he burst out laughing. 

“I—I—I—” I sputtered. 

“Don’t thank me,” Brent said. “Really. You don’t have to thank me. Now 
you’ll have the best report in school. I told you I could help you. I told you I 
could be your best friend.” 

“Oh, nooo!” I shouted. “Brent! How could you do that to me? You scared 
me to death! You scared Roxanne to death! You really hurt her! And you nearly 
strangled me!” 

“Don’t thank me,” he repeated. “You really don’t have to. I just wanted to 
show that I can help you.” 

“Get out of my house! Get out—now!” I screamed at him. “I mean it!” 

“GET OUT!” I cried, so loud my voice cracked. “Get out, you idiot! You 
nearly killed us! I want you to leave NOW. Get out!” 

I turned to the door and pointed to it. “Get—” 

Dad stood in the doorway, his face filled with concern. “Sammy, I’m sorry, 
son. But you’re too old to have an imaginary friend,” he said softly. 

“No, Dad. You don’t understand! He’s not my friend!” I cried. “He’s not my 
friend! He’s not!” 

Dad wrapped his arm around my shoulders. “Stay calm. Just try to stay 
calm.” 

He walked me to my bed. He made me sit down. 

He grabbed for my desk chair. 



“Don’t sit there!” I gasped. “He’s sitting there!” 

Dad sat down anyway. “Take a deep breath,” he instructed me. “Settle 
down. Now—let’s talk about this friend of yours.” 

“Dad! He’s not my friend. He wants to be my friend, but he’s not. He’s 
driving me crazy!” 

I shoved the black shirt aside and fell back on my pillow. And suddenly I 
had an idea. “I know! I bet we can get rid of him together! Dad—will you help 
me? Will you help me get rid of Brent?” 

“Of course I’ll help you,” Dad replied, his eyes studying me. He stood up. 
Took my hand. Guided me to the doorway. 

“Thanks, Dad! I really appreciate this. Thanks a lot.” I sighed with relief. 

I suddenly felt much better. As soon as Dad said he’d help, all my muscles 
relaxed. 

“Everything is going to be okay,” Dad said softly. 

“I know,” I replied. “I feel better already.” 

“That’s great, son. But can you tell me—what’s troubling you? Do you 
know? What made you invent this invisible friend—Brent?” 

I let out a loud groan. 

Dad didn’t believe me. He led me downstairs. 

“Where are we going?” I asked. 

He didn’t answer me. 

“Dad!” I cried. “Where are you taking me?” 



27 


“Where are we going, Dad? TELL ME NOW!” 

“Calm down, Sammy. We have an appointment with someone who can help 
you,” he finally answered. “Mom and I have talked about your problem with Dr. 
Krandall—and she’s going to see you now.” 

“I—I don’t want to go to a doctor!” I yelled. “I don’t need a doctor!” 

“Don’t worry.” Dad patted me on the back. “You’ll like talking to the 
doctor. She’s really nice. And very understanding.” 

Dad hurried to the kitchen to get his car keys. 

Dad thinks I’m crazy, I realized. He thinks I’ve totally lost it. 

So does everyone else I know. 

There’s no way I can convince anyone that Brent is real. 

He’s going to live with me forever. 

He’s going to ruin my life forever. 

Someone knocked at the door. I pulled it open. 

“Hi, Sammy.” It was Roxanne. “I had to come over!” she said. “I had to 
talk to you about the ghost! Wasn’t that awesome?” 

“Uh-huh. Really awesome,” I murmured. 

“Well, you don’t sound very excited. What’s the matter with you?” She 
headed into the living room and sat down on the couch. 

“Oh, nothing. Everyone thinks I’m crazy—that’s all.” I sat down beside her. 

Brutus sauntered in and curled up in my lap. 

“Did you tell your parents about the ghost? Is that why they think you’re 
crazy? Don’t worry! I’ll tell them it’s all true,” Roxanne assured me. “I’ll tell 
them we really saw it!” 

“It’s not about the ghost—” 

“Okay, Sammy. Let’s go.” Dad walked into the room, jingling the car keys 
in his hand. 

Mom and Simon followed behind him, both wearing very serious 
expressions. 

“Where are you going?” Roxanne asked. “Can I come too?” 

“No, Roxanne. I don’t think that would be a good idea,” Dad said softly. 



“I’m taking Sammy to a doctor. He’s been seeing things.” 

“But everything is going to be okay,” Mom chimed in. She gazed at me 
with a strange smile on her face. “Doctors know how to deal with these things.” 

“You don’t have to take Sammy to a doctor,” Roxanne started. “The ghost 

“Is your invisible friend a ghost? You didn’t tell me that part,” Mom said. 

“Your invisible friend?” Roxanne’s eyebrows shot up. “He’s still in your 
room?” 

“Wait, Dad—don’t take Sammy to the doctor!” Simon exclaimed. 

Whoa. I couldn’t believe this one. Simon was actually sticking up for me. 

“Don’t take him tonight,” Simon added. “Take him tomorrow. He’ll still be 
crazy tomorrow. I want you to help me with my science project tonight. I’m not 
growing fast enough. I want you to help me come up with a new topic.” 

“It will have to wait, Simon. Your brother needs help,” Dad said sternly. 
“Come on, Sammy. Let’s go.” 

“I am not going to a doctor!” I shouted. “Wait. What if I prove that Brent is 
real?” 

I didn’t give them a chance to answer. I had a plan. A really good plan. If it 
worked, they’d believe me. They’d have to believe me. 

I charged down to the basement. And searched Dad’s workbench. 

Where is it? Where is it? I searched frantically. It’s got to be here 
somewhere! 

I cleared the benchtop with a swipe of my hand. Everything clattered to the 
floor. But I found it! 

The Molecule Detector Light. 

I charged back upstairs. “This light lets you see invisible things, right?” I 
waved the light in Dad’s face. “So if I shine it on Brent, we’ll ah be able to see 
him! Right, Dad? Right?” 

“Maybe,” Dad replied doubtfully. “But, Sammy—” 

I ran to the stairs. Everyone followed me. 

Will it work? I wondered. Will it?

“Where are you, Brent? I know you’re here.” 

Everyone crowded into my room. 

They watched me as I slowly turned in a circle, searching for a clue. 
Searching for something that would tell me where Brent was. 

“Brent!” I called his name. 

He didn’t answer me. 

I turned on the detector light. 

I swept it through the room. 

No sign of Brent anywhere. 

“Sammy, this is silly,” Mom said. She turned to Dad for support, but Dad 
just shrugged his shoulders. 

I kneeled down and swept the light under my bed. 

No Brent. 

“Please put the light down,” Mom pleaded. “We’re wasting time. We have 
an appointment with the doctor.” 

I ignored her. 

“Where are you, Brent? I know you’re here!” I said. “Tell us where you are 
—now!” 

And then, finally, Brent spoke up. “Please. Please don’t do it, Sammy. 
Please—I don’t want you to see me.” 

Mom, Dad, Simon, and Roxanne gasped. 

“See!” I cried. “I told you! I told you he was here! I told you I’m not 
crazy!” 

I swept the light over my desk chair. Onto my bed. In front of my dresser. 
But Brent wasn’t any of those places. 

“Where are you, Brent? It’s okay. You can tell me. I have to show them.” 
“Please. NO!” Brent cried. “I don’t want you to!” 

I jerked open the closet door. 

I shined the light inside—and I saw him! 

“NO! I don’t believe it!” I gasped. “You’re—you’re a MONSTER!” 



29 


“You’re a MONSTER!” I cried again. 

The Molecule Detector Light shook in my trembling hand. I forced myself 
to hold the bright beam steady. 

“That’s why my parents made me invisible,” Brent said softly. “They 
thought I might survive if you couldn’t see me.” 

With my light still focused on him, Brent stepped toward me. 

I leaped back. “What are you going to do?” 

“Whoa—he is so UGLY!” Simon groaned. “Yuck! He has only one head!” 

“And look. He has only two arms—and they’re so short!” Roxanne cried. 
“He can’t wrap his arms around and around himself. How does he keep himself 
warm?” 

“And what’s that dark stuff growing on top of his head?” Simon pointed. 
“Why doesn’t he have tendrils and suction pods like we do? Where are his 
antennae? And how can he see with only two eyes?” 

“Calm down, everyone,” Dad instructed. “You’re not going to harm us—are 
you, Brent?” 

“No. Of course not,” Brent replied. “I just want to be Sammy’s friend.” 

“No! Be my friend!” Simon cried. “I need you for my science project!” 

Simon turned to Dad. “Can I have him, Dad? PLEASE! Can I have him for 
my science project? I really need him!” 

“That wouldn’t be fair,” Roxanne replied. “Sammy found him first!” 

“Everyone—quiet!” Mom ordered. “Brent—I’ve seen pictures of your 
species in a textbook. Hmm... let me see... what are you called?” 

“I’m called a human,” Brent answered shyly. 

“That’s right!” Mom snapped her fingers. “Now I remember. Human.” 

“Yuck,” Roxanne muttered, making a disgusted face. 

“I know I’m ugly,” Brent said sadly. “That’s why I didn’t want you to see 
me...” His voice trailed off. 

I stared at Brent in disbelief. A human. I’d never heard of one before. 

I tore my five eyes away from him and turned to Dad. “I know he’s ugly, 
Dad. But I think I’d like to keep him,” I said. “Can I? I’ll take good care of him. 
I promise!” 



“No. I don’t think so, Sammy.” Dad studied Brent for a moment. “I think 
we’d better take Brent to the zoo.” 

“Huh? The zoo?” I cried. “Why, Dad? Why does he have to live in a zoo?” 
“Well, he’ll get much better care there,” Dad answered. “After all, humans 
are an endangered species!”

DEEP TROUBLE II 


Goosebumps - 58 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


I’m back. 

That’s what I thought when I arrived on the Cassandra for another summer 
vacation. 

Yes, I, William Deep, Jr., world-famous undersea explorer, am back. 

One year older. One year wiser. One year tougher. 

I breathed in a big gulp of salty air. I gazed at the clear green Caribbean sea 
around me. 

My little sister, Sheena, stood beside me. But I pretended she wasn’t there. 

She sort of ruined the atmosphere for me. She usually does. 

The Cassandra is my uncle’s boat. It’s a floating research lab. 

My uncle, Dr. George Deep, is a marine biologist. My parents sent me and 
Sheena to visit him on our summer vacation. They sent us the year before too. 

Dr. D. lives on the boat in the Caribbean all year long, studying tropical 
fish. It’s fun for us. We get to swim and stuff. My uncle is really nice. And my 
parents figure we’ll learn a lot about science and ocean life while we’re with 
him. 

Last summer I made one of the most shocking discoveries in the history of 
marine biology. 

I found a mermaid. A real mermaid. 

No one believed me, of course. I wasn’t a grownup scientist. I was a 
twelve-year-old boy on vacation in the Caribbean. 

Know-it-all Sheena thought I was lying. 

My uncle, Dr. D., thought I was making it up. He didn’t believe in 
mermaids. 

Until I proved him wrong. 

We didn’t tell anyone about the mermaids. Some really bad guys wanted to 
capture them and put them in cages. To protect the mermaids, Sheena, Dr. D., 
and I agreed to keep them a secret. 

So the world will never know... 

And now, I’m back! I told myself. Billy Deep, one of the greatest explorers 
in the seven seas. 



And I’m not a twelve-year-old kid anymore. 

I’m thirteen. 

And this summer, I’m going to find something big. Something even more 
amazing than a mermaid. 

This time, the world will hear about it. This time I’ll be famous. 

I hope. 


* * * 


The fire coral glowed bright red. I snorkeled near it, careful not to touch it. 

I’d stepped on fire coral once before. It burned my foot like crazy. 

They don’t call it fire coral for nothing. 

I studied the coral wall. Neon-bright fish darted in and out of the delicate 
holes. It was beautiful. There, under the water, everything seemed calm. Quiet. 
Peaceful. 

But I knew better. I was an experienced snorkeler. A snorkeling hero. 

An untrained swimmer wouldn’t have noticed it. That little ripple in the 
water. The way the fish all suddenly disappeared. 

But I felt it. That whiff of danger. 

Something was coming. Something deadly. 



2 


I whirled around—and faced the intruder. 

A giant octopus! 

“WHOOOA!” The snorkel flew from my mouth as I cried out in shock. An 
octopus! It rose up in the water, its purple body as big as mine ! 

I shoved the mouthpiece back into my mouth. And frantically tried to thrash 
away from it. 

But before I could get moving, I felt something cold and soft wrap around 
my throat. 

Ohhhh. 

A tentacle as thick as a human arm. 

Its suction pods snapped to my skin. It started to pull me... pull me down. 

No! 

Gasping for breath, I lifted my head out of the water. And let out a choked 
cry for help. 

I felt another cold tentacle slide around my waist. And then another around 
my chest. 

I thrashed and kicked. But the huge creature was too powerful. The big 
suction pods made loud sucking sounds as they tightened against my skin. 

The tentacles pulled me... pulled me... 

Until everything went black. 

No! No! 

I wasn’t losing consciousness. The blackness that washed around me was 
octopus ink. 

I shut my eyes. Twisted and squirmed. 

But the tentacles pulled harder. Pulled me down into the inky blackness. 

I choked and sputtered. And struggled up to the surface. 

The water tossed and churned, black with octopus ink. 

The big suction pods bit into my bare skin. 

The tentacles tightened... tightened around my ribs, my stomach. 

I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t move. 

I’m going under, I realized. I’m doomed. Doomed! 



My lungs felt about to explode. 

No! I thought. I can’t die! Not like this! 

There must be a way to make the octopus let go. 

With a last burst of strength, I slid my right arm free. 

Now what? Now what? 

I stretched a finger toward its throbbing, purple belly. 

Red and yellow stars flashed before my eyes. I knew I had little time. I was 
about to pass out any second. 

I reached toward the big throbbing body. With my last bit of strength, I 
wriggled my fingers. Please let this work, I prayed. Please... Then I started 
tickling. 



3 


My fingers tickled the purple belly. 

Tickle, tickle! 

The octopus squirmed. 

Tickle, tickle! 

The tentacles relaxed. 

Yes! Yes! It’s working! The octopus was ticklish! 

Its big body heaved—and it shoved me away. 

“Stop it, Billy!” the octopus whined. “I hate your stupid jokes. Stop tickling 

me!” 

Then the octopus pinched me. 

Okay, okay. So it wasn’t an octopus. It was my little sister, Sheena. 

Sheena always spoils my fun. She has no imagination. She hates to pretend. 
Well... it’s true that she doesn’t look much like an octopus. She looks a lot 
like me, actually. Skinny, with straight black hair. Hers is long, and mine is short. 
We both have dark blue eyes and bushy dark eyebrows. 

She’s younger than I am. She’s only eleven. But she acts like an old lady 
sometimes. She hates games. She likes cold, hard facts. 

“What were you pretending this time?” Sheena teased. “That you were a 
tickle-fish?” 

“None of your business,” I answered. She would never admit that I was a 
great undersea explorer. Had she forgotten about the mermaids? 

It didn’t matter. Other little sisters look up to their big brothers. Not Sheena. 
If I told her I was pretending she was an octopus, she’d never stop teasing 
me. 

“You’re a moron, Billy,” she groaned. 

Do you believe she calls a great undersea explorer a moron ? 

“I’ll show you,” I replied lamely. 

I love to play tricks on Sheena. It isn’t easy to fool her. 

But I had an idea. I thought of a mean trick to play on her that would scare 
her—but good. 

I swam back to the boat. 



I flipped my mask up and climbed aboard the Cassandra. It was a big, 
sturdy boat, about fifty feet long, with a large open deck. Below deck were 
research labs, a galley, and a few cabins for sleeping. 

The white deck steamed in the sun, deserted. It was about noon. 

Dr. D. must be down below, I realized. Perfect. 

I didn’t want him to see me and blow my trick. 

I reached under a stack of life jackets. I pulled out a square, gray vinyl 
pillow I’d hidden there. 

I stared out toward the reef. Sheena was busy snorkeling. She wasn’t 
looking. 

Good. 

Here was my plan: I was going to swim underwater, holding the gray pillow 
over my head. I’d hold it so one of the corners pointed up. You guessed it. Like a 
shark’s fin. 

Then I’d swim at Sheena as fast as I could. She’d think a shark was headed 
straight for her! 

It would scare her to death. I couldn’t wait to hear her screaming to me for 

help. 

“We’ll see who’s a moron,” I murmured to myself. 

I slipped back into the water. Holding the pillow in sharkfin position, I 
started kicking. I swam underwater toward the reef. Toward Sheena. 

After a few minutes, I bobbed up for breath. She hadn’t seen me yet. 

Holding the “sharkfin” high, I paddled closer. Closer. 

Then I heard them. At last. The screams. 

“Shark!” Sheena wailed. “Help! A shark!” 

Ha! Ha! Excellent screaming, Sheena! 

I finally fooled Miss Know-It-All! 

“Shaaark!” she wailed again. 

I couldn’t stay underwater any longer. I had to rise up so I could laugh in 
her face. 

I popped my head above the water. 

Hey! Sheena was swimming frantically toward the boat. She was still 
screaming like crazy. 

But she wasn’t looking in my direction. She hadn’t even seen me. 

“Shark!” she cried again. She made a frightened motion toward the reef. 

I saw it too. A huge sharkfin! A real one! 



4 


“Huh?” I let out a terrified gasp. 

The shark was as big as a whale ! 

Where did it come from? Dr. D. had told us there were no large sharks in 
the area. 

I guess no one told the shark! 

It rose up, tossed by a wave. And I gaped at its silvery-white body—as long 
as a canoe! 

It snapped its massive jaws. The CRAACK echoed over the water. 

“Whooooa!” I let go of the pillow and paddled for the boat as fast as I 
could. My heart raced. The water felt as thick as mud. Why couldn’t I swim 
faster? 

“Hurry, Billy!” Sheena called. I glanced back. 

The gigantic gray fin cut through the water like a powerboat. 

The shark sped straight for us. 

“Swim!” I ordered myself. “Faster! Faster!” 

Sheena and I thrashed toward the boat. I didn’t glance back again. I didn’t 
want to see how close the big shark was! 

Gasping, my entire body aching, I reached the Cassandra. I grabbed the 
side. Almost safe. Almost. 

Sheena scrambled up the ladder ahead of me. 

“Hurry!” I shouted. I clutched the ladder and glanced back. 

The shark roared closer. So close, I could see its glassy black eyes. And its 
mouth full of jagged teeth. 

“Sheena, go!” I screamed. I shoved her up onto the deck and scrambled up 
the ladder. 

“We made it!” Sheena gasped. 

Gasping for breath, my chest heaving, I stared over the rail. 

The shark kept coming! Like a submarine with teeth! 

“NOOOO!” 

I let out a hoarse wail as the huge fish slammed into the side of the boat! 

“NOOOOOO!” 



The whole boat rocked—and tilted. 

I grabbed the rail and held on. 

“Hold on, Sheena!” I shouted. “It’s attacking!” 

I braced myself for another jolt. 

Nothing happened. 

The shark disappeared into the churning water. 

Dr. D. appeared on deck, looking confused. “What’s going on?” he cried. 

Sheena and I ran to him, screaming, “A shark! A shark!” 

“What?” Dr. D. stared out to sea. 

The water gleamed calmly now. Soft waves splashed against the side of the 

boat. 

The monster shark had vanished. 

“Billy—there is nothing out there. What are you talking about?” Dr. D. 
demanded. 

“There was a shark! A huge shark! It chased us,” Sheena cried breathlessly. 
“It crashed into the boat!” 

“A shark?” Dr. D. shook his head. “No way. No way a shark could make the 
boat rock like that.” 

“But it was HUGE!” I screamed. “It was as big as ten sharks!” 

“As big as twenty sharks!” Sheena exclaimed. 

Dr. D. rubbed his bald spot. “I told you two before. I checked the radar. I 
checked out all of my sonic surveyors. There are no large sharks in this area.” 

He stared me in the eye and asked, “Are you sure, Billy? Are you sure you 
saw a shark?” 

“We’re sure!” Sheena insisted. We both knew he’d believe her before he’d 
believe me. 

“Come down to the lab with me, kids,” Dr. D. said. 

We followed him below deck to one of the labs. Dr. D. pointed to a large 
tank in the corner. It held a silvery fish the size of a big dog. 

Sheena gasped. “Wow! I’ve never seen a fish like that before!” 

“Neither have I,” Dr. D. said solemnly. “That’s what bothers me.” 

I stared at the fish as it swam around in the tank. It looked sort of familiar, 
but I didn’t know why. 

“I can’t identify it,” Dr. D. went on. “I’ve never seen a fish this size that 
looks like this. I’ve been searching through all my books, but I can’t find it!” 

He pointed to a stack of books on marine biology. I picked one up and 



flipped through it. It had page after page of cool color photos of all kinds of fish. 

Dr. D. glanced over my shoulder as I examined the book. “It can’t be in that 
section, Billy,” he told me. “All those fish are tiny.” 

I turned a page, looking for the big fish section. Then I turned another page 
—and gasped. 

Dr. D. gripped my shoulder as he stared down at the photo with me. “No!” 
he cried. “It can’t be!” 



5 


We crowded around the book, staring at the photo. It showed a fish exactly like 
the one in the tank. Thin, silvery... but there was one huge difference. 

“It’s a minnow!” Dr. D. exclaimed. “But that’s impossible!” 

I read the words under the picture. “Tropical minnow, one inch long.’” 

I glanced at the fish in the tank. It was more like four feet long! 

Dr. D.’s eyes narrowed as he studied the fish. “How could a minnow get so 
huge?” he wondered out loud. “I must examine it more closely.” 

Sheena and I stood behind him, watching. He studied the picture of the 
minnow through a magnifying glass. Then he turned to the giant minnow, staring 
at its scales, checking every mark. 

“The markings are exactly the same,” Dr. D. murmured. 

“Can I look through the magnifying glass?” Sheena asked. 

“Sure.” Dr. D. passed the glass to her. 

“A minnow...” Dr. D. murmured. “How can this giant fish be a minnow? 
It’s supposed to be as small as your goldfish, Billy.” 

My goldfish! “Whoops,” I cried. “I forgot to feed my goldfish this 
morning.” 

“Better go do it,” Dr. D. said. 

I started toward the lab door. On my way, I spotted a cabinet filled with 
glass bottles. “What’s in these, Dr. D.?” I asked. 

He turned away from the monster minnow to look. “Oh, that’s plankton,” 
he replied. “It’s made of tiny little plants and animals that clump together and 
float around in the water. Lots of fish eat it. I gathered these samples from the 
waters around here.” 

I picked up a bottle. All I could see was murky brown water with greenish- 
brown gunk floating on top. 

Sheena turned the magnifying glass on the plankton. “Gross,” she said. 

“Go ahead and take a bottle, Billy,” Dr. D. suggested. “Feed some to your 
goldfish. They’ll love it.” 

“Thanks, Dr. D.” Clutching the bottle, I headed down the passageway to my 
cabin. 

As I pushed open the door, I said, “Hello, little fish faces. I’ve got a 



delicious surprise for you!” 

But the fish had a bigger surprise for me. Way bigger. 

I stared at the fishbowl. And nearly dropped the bottle of plankton. 
Then I screamed, “NO!” 

I burst out of my cabin. “Help! Help! Dr. D.!” I cried. 

“There’s a head— someone’s head —in my fishbowl!” 



6 


Dr. D. and Sheena hurried out of the lab. I glanced back at my cabin door, and 
— oof !—slammed right into Sheena. 

“Ow!” she whined. “Watch it, Billy!” 

“Billy, what’s wrong?” asked Dr. D. 

“Ahead!” I gasped, pointing frantically to my cabin. 

I struggled to breathe. My stomach lurched. “Oh, wow. Oh, wow. There— 
there’s a human head in my fishbowl!” 

Dr. D. frowned and charged into my room. Sheena and I followed. 

He pushed open the door... and stopped short with a gasp. 

“See!” I shouted. 

The head stared at us, eyes open, through the glass. 

How could Dr. D. and Sheena stand to look at it? It was making me sick. I 
gulped and turned away. 

Sheena giggled. 

Giggled? 

“What’s the matter with you, Sheena?” I demanded. “What’s so funny?” 

She crossed the room and reached into the fishbowl. 

“Sheena, no!” I warned. “Don’t touch it!” 

Sheena laughed—and lifted the head out by the hair. Then she waved the 
head, dripping with water. 

“Oh, nooooo!” I groaned. I stared at the head in horror. 

I could see it clearly now. I could see that it wasn’t a human head after all. 

It was a large doll’s head. 

“Got you back!” Sheena taunted. “Got you back for all the tricks you’ve 
been playing on me all summer!” 

Dr. D. grinned. “You almost fooled me too,” he confessed. “The water in 
the fishbowl made the doll’s head look bigger than it really is. Good one, 
Sheena.” 

“Thanks, Dr. D.” Sheena took a little bow. 

My face felt hot. I knew I was blushing. I was so embarrassed. It just isn’t 
like me to fall for such a stupid joke! 



Besides, I’m supposed to be the joker. Not Sheena. 

I stared into the tank. Something was missing. 

“Hey!” I said. “Where are my goldfish? And where’s my snail?” 

Sheena shrugged. I grabbed her by the neck. “What did you do with them?” 

“Okay, okay, don’t worry,” she said. She pushed me away. “I put them in a 
smaller bowl and left them in the bathroom.” 

“Well, get them!” I insisted. I was really angry. 

“I’m going, I’m going,” Sheena said. She brought my fish and my snail 
back, and I gently returned them to their bowl. 

“Don’t ever touch them again!” I told my sister. “I don’t want anything to 
happen to them.” 

I watched the fish swim around for a minute. They didn’t look right. I 
shook my head. “Something’s the matter with them,” I said. 

“Give them a little plankton, Billy,” Dr. D. suggested. “That ought to perk 
them right up.” 

I grabbed the glass bottle and pulled off the stopper. I poured a little of the 
slimy gunk into the bowl. 

The fish darted to the surface and started eating. They looked much happier. 

“Wow,” I said. “They love it!” 

“I thought they would.” Dr. D. smiled, but his eyes clouded over with 
worry. “Now, kids, no more jokes, please. I’m going back to the lab to examine 
that giant minnow. And I don’t want to be disturbed.” 

“We’ll be quiet,” Sheena promised. 

Dr. D. hardly seemed to hear her. “There’s something strange going on 
here,” he murmured. “Something very, very strange...” 

Little did we know that things were about to get much stranger.

I paced the deck, thinking hard. I was dying to get Sheena back for that stupid 
doll trick. 

She seemed nervous the rest of the afternoon. Waiting for me to strike. 

But I hadn’t thought of anything good enough. I’d spent all night thinking, 
until I fell asleep. 

Now it was the next day. Sheena’s guard was down. Maybe she’d forgotten 
—forgotten that she’d been the last one to play a trick on me. 

And now it was her turn to be fooled. 

What would make her hair stand on end? I wondered. What would scare her 
so much, she’d scream her head off? 

The shark trick with the pillow had backfired. So I really owed her two 
tricks. 

Maybe I could leave something gross in her bed? 

The morning sun beat down on me. Summer days were hot in the 
Caribbean. I started to get a headache. 

But I finally thought of something good to do to Sheena. 

I grabbed my snorkeling gear and pulled it on. I decided to sneak off and 
explore a little. 

Dr. D. wanted us to stay close to the boat. But he didn’t want to be 
disturbed. So snorkeling seemed like a good idea. 

Mask and snorkel in place, I started down the boat ladder. 

“Caught you!” 

Sheena’s squeaky voice pierced my eardrums. She was always catching me 
doing something. 

“Where are you going?” she demanded. “Dr. D. said to stay close.” 

“I won’t go far,” I insisted. “I’m hot and I’m bored. I can’t sit on deck 
another second.” 

“Then I’m coming with you.” She snatched up her gear and started tugging 

it on. 

I dropped off the ladder and into the water. She slipped in beside me. 

“We shouldn’t be doing this,” she whispered. “What if that shark comes 
back?” 



“The shark is gone,” I said. “Don’t worry. Nothing bad will happen.” 
“Promise?” she asked, pulling down her mask. 

“Yeah. Sure. I promise,” I said. 

It was a peaceful, sunny day. The waves were as gentle as a lake. What 
could happen? 

Sheena and I swam out over the sunlit, gleaming water. We thought we’d 
see lots of pretty little fish. 

We found something else. Something we never expected in a million years. 



8 


I dunked Sheena’s head under the water. When she popped back up for air, I 
shouted, “Shark! Shark!” 

Sheena clonked me on the head with her fist. “Don’t even joke about it, 
Billy.” Still, I caught her glancing around nervously. 

I scanned the horizon too. No signs of a fin anywhere. 

A school of lemon-yellow fish drifted by, glowing like little suns in the 
water. Swimming slowly, I followed them to the coral reef. 

Wow, I thought. The coral made a cool shape at that spot. The fish swam 
through a big pink ring of coral and around a pointy coral peak. 

Sunlight filtered down on it through the water. It looked like the tower of a 
magic sand castle. 

A tiny crab popped out of one of the holes in the coral tower. It saw me 
coming and disappeared. 

The yellow fish suddenly rose to the surface, up to a plankton bed that 
floated on top of the water. 

The plankton looked just like the stuff Dr. D. kept in those bottles in his lab. 

I watched the fish nip at the plankton, just as my goldfish did. 

I surfaced and spit my snorkel out. 

“Sheena, check this out,” I called. 

No answer. 

“Sheena?” 

I saw a splash on the other side of the reef. Another splash. 

I glimpsed Sheena’s flippers as they slapped the water. 

I swam after her. She had her head down, snorkeling. She must have been 
watching something very closely. She swam fast, kicking her fins in a rapid, 
steady rhythm. 

“Sheena!” I called again. She couldn’t hear me. 

She wouldn’t hear me if I swam up beside her and screamed. She’s like that 
sometimes. Like when she does her homework. She gets so into it, she blocks 
everything else out. 

Of course she gets straight A’s. My mom and dad are constantly bragging 
about it. 



I sighed and paddled after her. I had to go get her. She was swimming out to 
sea without even realizing it. 

I watched her through my mask as I swam. What was that up ahead of her? 
A patch of cloudy water? 

Whoa. No. Not water. I’d never seen anything like it before. 

Sheena didn’t seem to see it. She was swimming steadily, straight for it. 
And, to my horror, it began to move! 

I blew water from my snorkel tube and squinted hard through my mask. 
The thing drifted closer. It was pink and rubbery. Like a soft blob of bubblegum. 
It billowed toward Sheena. 

And as I stared at it, it appeared to stretch. 

It billowed and stretched, billowed out like a pink parachute. Until it was 
bigger than Sheena. 

What is that thing? I wondered. Sheena, turn around! Didn’t she see it? 
Didn’t she see it expanding, curling out, stretching in front of her? 

“Sheena! Turn around! Turn around!” 

I wanted to shout. But I couldn’t shout underwater. 

I thrashed hard. Kicked. Spun around. Desperate to get her attention. 

Sheena!—turn around! I thought. Get away from that thing! Get away— 

now! 

But she kept her head down. And swam straight into the billowy pink blob. 
And as I stared on helplessly, it wrapped itself around her. Like an 
enormous pink clam, it opened wide... wider... and slipped itself around her. 
Held her. Held her tight. Pulled her inside. 

And swallowed her. 



9 


For a moment, I froze in terror. 

Then I pulled myself to the surface. Tossed off the mask. And started to 
swim toward her. 

I splashed across the water, racing toward the pink blob. It writhed and 
wriggled with my sister inside it. 

What is it? I wondered. What can it be? 

And then, as I pulled myself closer, I knew what it was. 

I was staring at a jellyfish! 

A jellyfish bigger than a human. 

Whoa! 

I could see through it. I saw the white, filmy slime and the red veins that 
made it look pink. 

And Sheena—trapped inside! 

Poor Sheena. Squirming. Kicking. Slapping at the gooey pink sides of the 
creature. 

Her face pushed up against the veiny jellyfish skin! Through her mask, I 
saw her eyes wide with terror. 

The ugly creature wrapped around her like a slimy blanket, covering her 
whole body. 

She pushed both fists against the filmy, pink curtain. 

I knew she didn’t have much air left in her lungs. 

I had to do something. But what? 

Sheena’s face twisted in panic. 

I’ll have to pry it open somehow, I decided. 

I swam up to the wriggling blob. I tried to grab its side. 

Ugh! My hands slid right off. 

I grabbed for it again. No way. I couldn’t get a grip on it. It was like 
squeezing Jell-O. 

Its skin slapped against me, so slimy and sticky. 

Sheena stared out at me, eyes bulging with terror. 

I tried to wrestle the ugly creature. I dug my fingernails into it. 



It wriggled and throbbed. But it didn’t open. 

Then I realized what I had to do. 

The thought made me want to puke. But I knew I had no other choice. 
Sheena couldn’t hold out much longer. 

I had to slide inside the jellyfish myself. I had to get in there somehow and 
pull Sheena out. 

I swallowed. 

My stomach lurched. 

I lowered my head and dove for the seam, the opening where the disgusting 
pink blob had folded itself in half. 

Here goes! I told myself. 

I’m going inside.... 



10 


I worked my hands inside first. Then I lowered my head and pulled myself in. 
The slime oozed across my face. The red veins rubbed my skin raw. 

I held my breath and worked my way toward Sheena’s feet. If I could make 
it halfway in and grab her feet, maybe I could yank her out. 

The blob pulsed, sucking me deep inside. I inched in, stretching toward 
Sheena’s foot. 

My lungs were ready to burst. I couldn’t hold my breath much longer. 
Closer, closer... 

Aha! My fingers closed around Sheena’s flipper! 

I tugged. Hard. 

Harder. 

She started to move. 

No. 

Oh, no! 

Sheena’s flipper. It came off in my hand. 

I let go of the flipper and reached up a little higher. I grabbed her foot. And 
tugged. 

Sheena slipped down a little. 

I yanked on her foot again. Come on! I thought. Move! 

But this time Sheena didn’t budge. 

The sticky pink skin tightened around us. My insides felt as if they were 
about to explode! 

The jellyfish squeezed us tighter and tighter. 

It was squeezing us to death! 



11 


I couldn’t move. My mind raced. 

How can I get out of here? How? 

There was no way. We were doomed! 

I’m going to black out, I realized. Another second without air, and... 
Suddenly, the jellyfish loosened its grip. With a horrible sucking noise, it 
peeled apart. 

It opened! 

I didn’t waste time. I grabbed Sheena and hauled her up. Up, up, to the 
surface. 

We burst out of the water, gasping for air. 

We made it! 

I sucked in a huge gulp of air. Aahh. It was great to breathe again. 

The blue faded from Sheena’s face as the color came back to her cheeks. 
“Are you okay?” I asked her. 

She nodded, still struggling to catch her breath. 

“You sure? Can you talk?” 

She nodded again. “Yes, Billy. I’m just great. I’ve never been better.” 

I knew she was fine. Her old smart-mouth was working perfectly. 

“What happened?” I cried. “Why did the jellyfish let us go?” 

Sheena shrugged. We peered down through the clear water. 

The jellyfish floated a few feet below us. And as we stared down at it, we 
saw why it forgot about us. 

We saw another enormous pink shape slither and slide toward the first one. 
It stretched out in the water as if spreading its wings. 

And then it tried to wrap the other jellyfish inside it. 

The two ugly creatures slapped together. The collision sent up a wave that 
tossed Sheena and me back. 

When I gazed down again, they were wrestling. Folding into each other. 
Slapping and twisting. Struggling to fold the other inside. To swallow it whole. 
Another sticky slap. Another. 

As they struggled, the water churned and swirled. 



The jellyfish monsters broke apart and slammed into each other again. 
Huge waves churned up around us. 

“We’ve got to get back to the boat!” I yelled. 

A wave slapped the side of my head. I choked and spit out a mouthful of 
seawater. 

We struggled to swim against the waves, but they kept knocking us down 
and pulling us out to sea. 

The water was so white and foamy, we couldn’t see the jellyfish fight 
anymore. But we could feel them. 

Another wave crashed down on us. I glanced around. “Sheena!” 

She was gone! 

I frantically searched through the foam. “Sheena!” 

Had she gone under? 

CRASH! Another wave. 

“Sheena, where are you?” I wailed. 

She popped up at last, sputtering and choking. I grabbed her and battled 
against the waves. I fought my way out of the wake of the jellyfish fight. 

A few seconds later, Sheena and I dragged ourselves aboard the Cassandra. 
“That was so weird,” Sheena said after we both had caught our breaths. 
“Those jellyfish—they were as big as cars!” 

“We’ve got to tell Dr. D. about this—right away!” I exclaimed. 

We ran down to the lab. No sign of Dr. D. there. 

“Dr. D.!” I called. “Where are you?” 

“I’ll check the galley,” Sheena said. 

I hurried to see if my uncle was in his cabin. No. The tiny room stood 
empty. 

“He’s not in the galley!” Sheena cried. “I don’t see him anywhere!” 

“Dr. D.!” I shouted. “Dr. D.!” 

No reply. 

Sheena’s chin quivered. I knew she was scared. 

It was impossible. But true. 

“He-he’s gone!” I cried. 



12 


A pang ripped through my stomach. Dr. D. had just—vanished! 

Sheena and I were alone in the middle of the sea! 

“What are we going to do?” I asked softly. 

“Don’t panic,” Sheena said. But her voice shook. “Think. Where could he 
go? Know what? Maybe he just went for a swim.” 

“A swim? A swim?” I cried, my voice rising. “We probably would have 
seen him! Besides, since when does Dr. D. just go for a swim? Never!” 

“Well—there’s always a first time,” Sheena suggested. Her eyes darted 
around nervously. I could see her thinking, trying to stay calm. 

“Maybe he went out in the dinghy,” she suggested. Dr. D. kept a small boat 
on deck for short trips. “Let’s see if it’s gone. Maybe he went out to look for us.” 

“Good idea.” At least it was something. A little hope to cling to. 

We hurried up to the deck. I crossed my fingers, hoping to find the dinghy 
gone. 

If the little boat was gone, that meant Dr. D. was probably okay. He’d be 
back soon. 

But if the dinghy was still tied to the deck, and Dr. D. wasn’t on the 
Cassandra ... 

Then what? 

I raced to the back deck and around to the right— 

“Oh, no.” I sighed. 

The dinghy sat in its usual spot. Dr. D. hadn’t taken it out. 

“Billy, I’m scared,” Sheena whispered. 

I was scared too, but I didn’t want to admit it. Not yet, anyway. 

“Let’s check every cabin again,” I suggested. “Maybe he’s in the bathroom 
or something. Maybe he didn’t hear us calling him.” 

Sheena followed me down the stairs that led below-deck. Halfway down, 
the railing rattled in my hand. 

“Cut it out, Sheena,” I snapped. 

“Cut what out?” she cried. 

Now the whole stairway shook. 



What was she doing? Jumping up and down? 

I turned around to check. She stood perfectly still. 
“See! I’m not doing anything!” 

The boat shook and tilted. 

I clutched the rail to keep from falling over. 
“What’s happening?” I cried. 



13 


“It’s an earthquake!” Sheena shrieked. 

“How can it be an earthquake?” I told her. “We’re on the water— 
remember?” 

We ran down the steps. The boat tilted, and we both banged hard into the 
cabin wall. 

We passed the lab. The bottles of plankton rattled in the cabinet. Everything 
rattled. I heard glasses breaking in the galley. 

I turned down the passage to my cabin—but I couldn’t get by. Something 
blocked my path. 

Something... 

“YAAAIIII!” A scream escaped my throat before I could stop it. 

“What is that thing?” I cried. 

Sheena caught up to me. “Huh? What thing?” 

And then she saw it too. It was hard to miss! 

“A monster!” 

A big creature blocked the passage. It was shiny and black and smooth. And 
almost perfectly round. It sat in a disgusting puddle of thick white slime. 

I’d never seen anything like it before. 

Except—something about it looked familiar. 

“What is it?” Sheena choked out. 

The monster stirred. It shook. 

And then its head poked out. Long, dripping, and gray—like an enormous 
slug. With two antennas sticking out of the top. 

“Billy”—Sheena grabbed my sleeve—“It’s—I think it’s a snail!” 

“You’re right,” I muttered in shock. “It is a snail. A gigantic, monster 
snail!” 

“How did it get on the boat?” Sheena demanded. 

“How did it grow so big?” I added. “It’s blocking the entire passage!” 

Slowly, slowly, the snail lifted its slimy head. It trained its big, sad, watery 
eyes on us—and moaned. 

“Help me! Help me!” it cried. 



14 


“YAAIIII!” Sheena screamed, and clutched my hand. 

I screamed back. “It’s talking!” 

“Kids! Help!” the snail moaned again. 

“Nooooooo! It’s talking! It’s talking! It’s so gross!” 

“Billy, calm down!” the snail scolded. “Stop screaming! I need... help!” 
Sheena and I both gasped. 

We both realized the snail wasn’t talking. It was Dr. D.! 

“I’m trapped. Under the snail!” he choked out. “Can’t breathe. Get me out. 
Hurry.” 

Dr. D.’s hand waved weakly from under the big snail. His fingers were 
dripping with the thick white slime. 

“The slime—it’s as thick as shaving cream!” I murmured. 

“Kids, hurry! Can’t breathe under here! The slime... going up my nose!” 
“What should we do, Dr. D.?” Sheena asked. 

He didn’t reply. 

“He’s suffocating!” I cried. “He’s drowning in snail slime!” 

A groan floated out from under the monstrous snail shell. 

“We’ve got to hurry!” Sheena cried. 

“I’ll tilt the snail over,” I told Sheena. “You pull Dr. D. out.” 

“Okay.” 

Dr. D. moaned. 

“We’re coming! We’re coming!” I cried. 

I pushed the shell. It was heavy. It didn’t move. 

“Try harder, Billy.” Sheena stood nearby, ready to grab Dr. D. and pull him 
out. 

I lowered my shoulder and threw my weight against the snail. “It’s not 
budging!” 

“I have an idea,” Sheena said. “The slime!” 

“Huh? What about it?” 

“The slime can help us,” she explained. She stood behind the snail. “Let’s 
both push the snail from behind. Maybe the slime will make it slide right off 



him!” 

I heard Dr. D. choking under the snail. He was swallowing slime! 

I started to gag. But I swallowed hard. Held my breath. Forced the nausea 
away. 

Sheena and I planted our feet behind the snail. 

“One, two, three, push!” she yelled. 

We threw our weight against the snail. It slid a little bit. 

“One more time—go!” 

We pushed again. 

The snail slowly slid off Dr. D.’s body. It hit the floor with a heavy thud. 

Dr. D. slowly climbed to his feet. He was covered with sticky white goop 
from head to toe. 

He coughed and spat out a big glob of slime. “Not tasty,” he muttered, 
shaking his head. 

“Dr. D.—what happened?” I asked. 

He smeared the gunk from his eyes. “I don’t know. All of a sudden, the boat 
started shaking. I fell down. And the next thing I knew— BOOM !—I found this 
giant snail on top of me!” 

I glanced at the snail. It stood quietly in the passageway, oozing slime. 
Where did it come from? And how did a snail get so big? 

“It seemed to come out of thin air,” Dr. D. said. 

“It looks a lot like the snail in my fishbowl,” I offered. “But my snail is tiny. 
It’s the size of my fingernail.” 

“Dr. D.!” Sheena cried. “We saw two gigantic jellyfish! One of them tried 
to squeeze me to death!” 

“What?” Dr. D. turned to Sheena. “Giant jellyfish? What on earth is going 
on in these waters?” 

The boat lurched. 

“Whoa!” I cried out as I lost my balance. 

The boat rocked hard to one side. We all slammed against the wall. 

“Now what?” Sheena moaned. 

“Grab the rail, kids!” Dr. D. shouted. “We’re tipping over!” 



15 


The boat heaved to one side. The huge snail slid across the floor and crashed into 
the wall. 

Tables drifted across the floor. Pictures fell off the walls. 

Sheena, Dr. D., and I were pressed against the wall. The boat tilted until we 
were practically lying down. 

“What’s happening?” Sheena cried. 

Crash! My cabin door flew open. Something thudded heavily inside. 

“What was that?” I asked. “Something’s going on in my cabin!” 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. I heard a heavy pounding sound from my room. 

“What on earth—?” Dr. D. murmured. 

Sheena gulped. “It sounds like some kind of monster!” 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. 

“I’m going to check it out,” I said. 

I tried to stand, but the tilt of the boat kept me pinned to the wall. 

“I can’t get up!” I complained. 

Sheena slid along the wall. “Try sliding!” 

I inched along the passageway. Sheena and Dr. D. slid along behind me. 

I came to a closed door—the door to Sheena’s cabin. I tried to step around 
it, but the gravity pull was too strong. I leaned against the door... 

“Whoa!” It flew open. I was about to fall in! 

I grabbed the door frame. Sheena’s cabin floor tilted down behind me. It 
was like being in the fun house at a carnival. 

“Hold on, Billy!” Dr. D. said. 

The floor tilted like a steep hill. If I let go of the door, I’d slide down the 
cabin floor. Then I’d have to crawl my way back up to the passage—if I could. 

I clung to the door frame. The gravity pulled me into Sheena’s room. 

“Help!” My feet slipped out from under me. I felt the wood giving way 
under my fingernails. 

“Pull yourself back up!” Dr. D. instructed. “Don’t let go!” 

I hauled my body uphill and threw myself to the left. I felt my back slap 
against the passage wall. 



I made it. I made it past Sheena’s room. Now all I had to do was slide down 
the passage to my cabin. 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. The pounding sound again, inside my cabin. 
Behind me, Sheena and Dr. D. struggled past the gaping door to Sheena’s 
cabin. 

At last I reached my cabin. The pounding grew louder. BOOM, BOOM, 
BOOM. 

What was going on in there? 

I peered through the doorway. 

“My goldfish!” I gasped. “Oh, nooooo!” 



16 


My goldfish bowl had smashed to the floor. My two fish lay in a puddle, 
flopping their tails. 

At least they looked like my goldfish. But there was one difference—one 
huge difference. 

My goldfish were gigantic! 

They filled my cabin. They were the size of small whales! 

Well, maybe not that big. But they were at least as big as me. 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. They flopped on the floor, their tails pounding into 
the wood. 

“They—they’re giants!” I gasped. 

“What’s going on?” Sheena cried. “How did everything get so big?” 

“Oh, my. Oh, my!” Dr. D. muttered over and over. “Oh, my!” He seemed to 
be in shock. 

We all stared at the fish. First the minnow, then the snail, and now this. It 
was hard to believe. 

What was happening? Why was everything suddenly growing so huge? 

“I feel like I’m living in some kind of dinosaur world,” I said. “Only instead 
of dinosaurs, we’re surrounded by giant sea creatures!” 

Dr. D. shook his head to clear it. “I’ve got to get a grip on myself. We’ve 
got big problems here!” 

“Huge problems!” Sheena added. 

“No wonder the boat’s tipping over,” Dr. D. said. “Those fish are 
monstrous! Their weight is pulling the boat over.” 

“My goldfish, my goldfish!” I couldn’t believe it. 

They looked beautiful, all golden and shiny. You could really see them now 
that they were so big—nearly as big as horses. Little brown specks on their gills 
and their scales glittered in the sunlight that spilled through my porthole. 

“We’ve got to get rid of them,” Dr. D. said. “Otherwise, they’ll tip over the 
boat.” 

“Can we shove them through the window?” Sheena asked. 

“They’re too big,” Dr. D. said. “We’ll have to haul them up to the deck 
somehow.” 



“And then what?” I asked. 

“Throw them overboard,” Dr. D. declared. “We can’t keep them here, that’s 
for sure.” 

“Maybe they’ll be happier in the ocean,” Sheena reasoned. “They probably 
hated being cooped up in that little bowl, anyway.” 

“But goldfish are freshwater fish!” I protested. 

“We have no choice, Billy,” Dr. D. said grimly. 

“We won’t survive out here. We won’t be able to sail anywhere—unless we 
get these giant fish overboard.” 

I knew he was right. The fish had to go. 

“You two grab the tail. I’ll push from the other side,” my uncle said. 

I tugged on the slick golden tail. “Unh—it’s so heavy!” I grunted. 

The fish flopped. The tail slapped Sheena’s hand. 

“Ow!” she cried. “That hurt!” 

“Hold him still!” Dr. D. ordered. 

We dragged the first fish out of my room—uphill—and into the passage. 
The snail no longer blocked our path. The snail slime in the passage helped us 
slide it out. 

We hauled the big fish up the steps. It flopped on the deck. 

“Good-bye, goldfish,” I said. 

We shoved it overboard. It flipped its tail and swam away. 

“Now we have to do it all over again,” Sheena complained. 

“And what about the snail?” I said. “It’s even heavier than these fish!” 

“One monster at a time,” Dr. D. said. 

As soon as we dragged the other fish overboard, the boat righted itself. 
“What a relief,” Dr. D. said. “I can stand up straight again!” 

“I’m beat,” Sheena whined. “This has been the worst day of my life.” 

We started back down below. The boat looked like the set of a disaster 
movie. Broken glass everywhere, pools of water, floors and walls streaked with 
white slime. And the giant snail sitting in the corner. 

“What are we going to do about him?” Sheena asked. 

Dr. D. sighed heavily. “Let’s just leave him for now.” 

I slipped on a puddle of slime on my way to my cabin. 

My cabin. What a mess. 

It looked as if a giant had come, turned it upside down, and shaken it. 



I headed for the closet to get a mop. I stopped. 

I thought I heard something. 

I listened. Yes. Footsteps. Up on deck. 

“Dr. D.?” I called. 

“Right here, Billy,” he answered. He was busy cleaning up his lab. 

Sheena popped out of her cabin. “Did you hear that?” she asked. 

I nodded. “Someone’s up on deck.” 

Dr. D. came out of the lab, wiping his hands on a towel. He glanced at me, 
then at Sheena. Then he looked up toward the ceiling. 

“If we’re all down here,” he began, “then who’s walking around up there?” 

We crept up the stairs and stepped out on deck. The afternoon sun beat 
down on us. “I don’t see anyone,” I said. “Look behind you,” boomed a deep 
voice. We turned around. There stood three men. Three total strangers. 



17 


The three men stood side by side, wearing shorts, button-down shirts, and 
boating shoes. 

The man who had spoken was tall and thin, with glasses and longish brown 
hair. On his left stood a burly, sunburned blond man. On the right, a curly-haired 
guy with a long, beaky nose on a birdlike face. 

I’d never seen any of them before. What were they doing on our boat? 

Dr. D. cleared his throat. “May I help you?” 

The tall man spoke. “I hope we didn’t frighten you. And I’m sorry to barge 
aboard like this, but we were worried. Are you in trouble? We saw your boat 
tilting dangerously to one side and became alarmed.” 

Dr. D. chuckled, trying to act casual. “We hit some rough water,” he lied. 
“But everything is all right now, as you can see.” 

Where did these guys come from? I wondered. I stepped to the edge of the 
deck and saw a motorboat tied up to the side. 

“I was afraid you were going to tip over,” the man said. “We thought we 
would have to rescue you!” 

“No, no. We’re fine now. Aren’t we, kids?” Dr. D. insisted. 

“Fine?” I blurted out. “What about—” 

Dr. D. squeezed my shoulder. Hard. I shut my mouth. 

Why was Dr. D. acting as if everything were okay? 

When goldfish blow up into monsters, everything is not okay. 

“It was very kind of you to come and help.” Dr. D. let go of my shoulder, 
finally. I rubbed it. 

“My pleasure.” The tall man smiled. “I’m glad there’s no trouble. Always 
happy to help a fellow sailor.” 

He offered his right hand. “I’m Dr. Ritter. These are my assistants, Mel 
Mason and Adam Brown.” Mel was the burly blond one. Adam was the curly- 
haired beaky one. 

Dr. D. shook his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Dr. George Deep. This is my 
nephew, Billy, and my niece, Sheena.” 

“Hi, kids. Wow, they look like good, strong swimmers.” 

Dr. D. grinned. “They are.” 



“What kind of doctor are you, Dr. Deep?” Dr. Ritter asked. “A surgeon on 
vacation?” 

Dr. D. shook his head. “No. I’m a marine biologist. The Cassandra is my 
floating lab.” 

“Really?” he asked. “A fellow scientist! Wonderful!” 

Dr. Ritter began to stroll around the deck, gazing at the ropes and 
equipment. His assistants followed him. 

“Tve got a floating lab myself,” Dr. Ritter told us. “Not far from here, as a 
matter-of-fact.” 

He sucked in a big breath of salty air and patted his chest. “Ah, yes. We 
marine biologists are a noble bunch, don’t you think, Dr. Deep? Studying the 
mysteries of the sea. It’s the last true frontier on earth, I always say.” 

Dr. D. trailed after him. “Yes. The last frontier,” he agreed. 

“What are you working on, if I may ask?” Dr. Ritter said. 

Dr. D. cleared his throat. “Oh, Tve got a couple of projects going. I can’t 
really talk about them now, Dr. Ritter. They’re in their early stages. I’m sure you 
understand.” 

The three strangers paused by the ladder where their boat was tied. 

“Yes. Indeed. I guess we should be leaving,” Dr. Ritter said. “I’m glad 
you’re all safe.” 

“Thanks for stopping to help,” Dr. D. said. 

Dr. Ritter put his hand on the ladder. Then he stopped. 

“By the way—you haven’t seen anything strange in the waters around here 
lately, have you?” 

“Strange?” Dr. D. asked. “What do you mean?” 

“Odd fish, unusual creatures, anything like that?” 

Odd fish! I couldn’t hold it in any longer. “We’ve seen all kinds of weird 
stuff!” I gushed. “My goldfish turned into giants! And we saw huge jellyfish 
bigger than a car! Ow!” 

Something sharp poked me in the ribs. My uncle’s elbow. 

Whoops. 

“I’m sorry to hear that,” Dr. Ritter said. 

“Yes, it was really scary!” I agreed. “Ow!” Dr. D.’s elbow again. “What did 
you do that for?” 

He frowned at me. 

What? I thought. What did I do this time? 



“Billy is just joking,” Dr. D. assured him. He played nervously with his 
glasses. 

Dr. Ritter said, “Joking? You weren’t really joking—were you, Billy?” 
“Well...” I gazed up at Dr. D. I didn’t know what to say. 

“I’m really sorry,” Dr. Ritter repeated. “I’m sorry you saw those creatures, 
Billy. Because now I can’t let you go.” 

“Huh?” I gasped. “What are you talking about?” 

“You’ve seen too much,” Dr. Ritter replied solemnly. “And now I have to 
decide what to do with you.” 

He snapped his fingers. The two assistants moved in. 



18 


“Hold on, there.” Dr. D. put his arms around me and Sheena. “Don’t pay any 
attention to Billy. He has a wild imagination.” 

“The wildest,” Sheena piped in. 

“He’s always making up stories,” Dr. D. went on. 

“He’s a big fat liar,” Sheena added. “Everybody knows that.” 

“Believe me, Dr. Bitter,” my uncle pleaded. “We haven’t seen anything 
strange at all. I mean, a giant goldfish? You’re a scientist, Dr. Bitter. You know 
as well as I do that that is impossible.” 

Dr. Bitter opened his mouth to speak. Something stopped him. Aloud noise. 
A loud, lumbering, thudding sound. 

CRASH! PLOP! 

Something broke through the doors and bounced onto the deck. 

The giant snail. 

I dropped my head in my hands. “Oh, no!” 

Dr. Ritter raised an eyebrow. “Looks like your brother is not the big fat liar 
you say he is.” 

“Oh, he’s a big fat liar, all right,” Sheena insisted. “And he’s stupid too.” 

I kicked her in the shins. 

“Ow!” she cried. 

“Kids, quiet!” Dr. D. commanded. 

The burly blond guy grabbed me. He pinned my arms behind my back with 
one hand and gripped me around the neck with the other. 

“Let go of me!” I shrieked. “That hurts!” 

“Quiet—or I’ll really hurt you!” the blond guy threatened. 

The beaky guy grabbed Sheena. She squirmed and tried to kick him. But he 
was too strong for her. 

“Let them go!” Dr. D. cried. 

Mel tightened his grip on me. 

“I’m so sorry, Dr. Deep,” Dr. Ritter said. “I hate to harm a fellow scientist. 
But you shouldn’t have snooped around here. I hate snoops.” 

He sighed. “What a shame you wandered into my plankton beds. What a 



shame you poked your nose into my experiments.” 

“What experiments?” Dr. D. asked. 

Dr. Ritter laid a strong hand on Dr. D.’s shoulder. “I’m working on such a 
brilliant project. It could change the world. It could solve all our problems!” 

“What is it?” 

“Ha-ha. You are a curious fellow!” Dr. Ritter laughed. “Well, I may as well 
tell you. I’ve been injecting a growth hormone into the plankton beds in these 
waters. The fish who feed on the plankton grow to be very large. You’ve seen 
the results yourself.” 

Dr. D. nodded. “But how does that solve any problems?” 

“In my heart, I’m a good man,” Dr. Ritter said. “I don’t want to hurt 
anyone. I want to help everyone ! I plan to raise huge fish to feed the world. No 
one will ever have to go hungry!” 

“Let go of me!” Sheena screamed. Adam still held her tightly. 

“This one is noisy,” Adam complained. 

“Let her go,” Dr. Ritter said. “For now.” 

Adam dropped his arms. But he stayed right behind Sheena. 

“Your experiments sound interesting, Dr. Ritter,” my uncle said. “I’d like to 
hear more. Are they working?” 

Dr. Ritter smiled. I could tell he liked to talk about his work. “Well, there 
are a few kinks at the moment. But nothing I can’t fix.” 

“What are you going to do with us?” Sheena broke in. 

Dr. Ritter frowned at her. “I’m afraid you know too much.” 

“But I am a scientist,” Dr. D. declared. “I would never tell anyone about 
your work. You have my word on that.” 

“Your word isn’t enough,” Dr. Ritter growled. His temper flared. His face 
reddened. “I can’t let anyone steal my idea.” 

“I would never steal!” my uncle insisted. 

“I’ll make sure of that,” the other scientist replied coldly. He turned to his 
two assistants. “Take them.” 

Before Sheena or I could move, Mel and Adam grabbed us and forced us 
into their motorboat. 

I broke away for a second. And scrambled for the ladder, trying to get back 
to the Cassandra. 

But before I could reach it, they grabbed Dr. D. and forced him aboard their 
boat too. 



Mel cut the line with one flick of a knife. Adam started the motor. 

It all happened so fast. We didn’t have a chance. 

Dr. Ritter jumped aboard and grabbed the wheel. He steered the boat out to 

sea. 

“Where are you taking us?” I cried. “What are you going to do?” 



19 


“Get down there!” Adam shoved Dr. D. down into the small cabin. Sheena and I 
stumbled after him. Mel followed behind us. 

“What are you going to do?” I repeated. 

“You’ll see,” Adam growled. 

We marched through a tiny galley. Mel and Adam forced us through a small 
door into a stuffy cabin with a table and chairs. Mel tied Dr. D. to a chair. 

“This really isn’t necessary,” my uncle said softly. I could see he was trying 
to sound calm. 

“Tell that to Dr. Ritter,” Mel muttered. 

Adam tied up Sheena, then me. 

“Not so tight!” I cried. I leaned over and bit Adam’s arm. 

“Good one, Billy!” Sheena bounced in her chair. 

“Hey!” Adam pulled back, rubbing his arm. “This kid bit me!” 

“Bite him back,” Mel muttered. 

Adam bared his teeth at me. But he didn’t bite me. And he didn’t tighten 
my ropes. 

My plan worked. I was tied to the chair—but not as tightly as he thought. 

Mel and Adam studied us. “Okay. We’ve taken care of them,” Mel said. 
“Let’s go get some lunch.” 

They left the cabin, shutting the door behind them. I could hear them in the 
little galley, rattling plates and silverware. 

I glanced out the porthole to my right. The boat was speeding away, far 
from the Cassandra. Out to sea. 

I jiggled my hands, trying to loosen the ropes. They were tied pretty well. If 
I could just get the rope to stretch a little... 

“What could this guy Ritter be up to?” Dr. D. wondered out loud. He wasn’t 
really talking to me and Sheena. He was figuring things out for himself. 

“This plankton he’s invented really does make fish grow bigger,” he said. 
“It could help end hunger in the world.” 

“Isn’t that good, Dr. D.?” Sheena asked. 

I rubbed my wrists against the ropes. Come on, loosen, I thought. 



“It might be good,” Dr. D. went on. “But it could be bad too. It could throw 
the whole balance of nature off.” 

Rub, rub, rub. I tested the ropes. Were they a little looser? 

“I mean, what are these giant fish supposed to eat? More and more 
plankton? They might eat up all the little fish. They might even start eating 
people. Who knows?” 

I stretched my hands against the ropes. The knot had loosened! I tried to 
pull one of my hands through. 

No. Still too tight. 

“And Dr. Ritter mentioned some kinks,” my uncle continued. “Some 
problems. I wonder what he was talking about. It could be anything.” 

I strained to hear what Mel and Adam were doing in the galley. It sounded 
as if they had taken their lunch up on deck. 

I yanked the ropes hard. I felt something give. 

I squeezed one hand through the rope. The knot burned against my skin. 

Pulling, pulling... 

I got it out! One hand was free! 

“Dr. D.!” I whispered. I held up my free hand. 

“Good going, Billy!” he whispered back. 

I untied my other hand and leaped up to untie my uncle. 

“Billy, hurry!” Sheena urged me. “Maybe we can sneak off the boat!” 

Then the door flew open. 

“You interrupted my lunch,” Dr. Ritter said, shaking his head. “That’s not 
very polite.” 

He blocked the doorway. Mel and Adam planted themselves beside him. 

“You want to get off the boat?” he asked. “That can be arranged. Mel, 
Adam. Take them on deck!” he ordered. 

Mel and Adam untied Sheena and Dr. D. and dragged us upstairs. Dr. 
Ritter’s lunch—sandwiches, a salad—sat half eaten on a table. 

The two men herded us to the side of the boat. I looked down. 

The ocean churned beneath us. No other boats, not a patch of land in sight. 

No one, nothing to save us. 

Nothing but sea—endless, deep sea. 

And gigantic, hungry, sea creatures. 

“Which one of you will jump first?” Dr. Ritter asked. “Or do you all want 
to go together?” 



I gazed down at the thrashing waves. Then I took a deep breath— 
And got ready to jump. 



20 


The waves crashed beneath me. My heart pounded so hard, it hurt. 

I sucked in a lungful of air. This could be my last breath, I realized. 

“Stop!” Dr. D. cried. “Let me jump, Ritter. Spare the kids. They can’t harm 
you or your experiments.” 

“I think a family should stick together,” Dr. Ritter said. “Especially a family 
of snoops.” 

“We’re not snoops!” Sheena protested. “We can’t help it if we accidentally 
saw some of your big fish!” 

“We won’t tell anyone about them! Really!” I cried. 

Dr. Ritter leaned close to Sheena. “Perhaps you would like to go first?” 

Sheena glared at him, but I saw her shaking. I knew she was really scared. 
And Sheena hardly ever gets scared. 

“Leave her alone,” Dr. D. warned. “Take us to an island—any island. 
Whatever is nearest. Then we won’t be able to tell anyone about your plankton 
experiments.” 

Dr. Ritter scowled. “There are no islands nearby. And I can’t take the 
chance. Sorry.” 

Dr. D. refused to give up. He kept trying to stall, to talk his way out of this. 

But there was no way. I could see that. 

Think! Think! I ordered myself desperately. There’s got to be some way to 
escape. There’s got to be. 

I glanced around, searching for something, anything. Maybe a life jacket! 
Didn’t they have life jackets on the boat? Or a floating ring? 

If I could grab some kind of float, at least we’d have a chance. 

But I didn’t see anything on the deck. I craned my neck to look back at the 
stern. 

My heart beat faster. Yes! A rubber lifeboat. 

“What are you looking at, kid?” Mel growled. “You looking for the coast 
guard or something? Believe me, there’s no one around to rescue you so forget 
about it.” 

“I—I wasn’t looking at anything,” I stammered. I was so scared, I could 
hardly breathe. 



“Enough of this stalling around,” Dr. Ritter interrupted. “You’re wasting my 
time. And you’re wasting your breath. And you’re going to need all the breath 
you’ve got. It’s time for a swim.” 

Sheena let out a scream. 

“Let her go,” Dr. D. shouted. 

Two strong hands gripped my shoulders. 

“Help!” I shrieked. “Please—no!” 

But screaming did no good. 

They pushed me over the side. 



21 


I shut my eyes and prepared for the cold shock of the water. 

But I didn’t fall. 

The strong hands didn’t let go. 

I felt myself pulled back into the boat—as a dark shadow swept overhead. 
“Huh?” I blinked several times. Was it a shadow—or my eyes? 

I heard a deafening noise. A clattering. A beating sound. 

I turned to Dr. D. He and the others all had their eyes on the sky. 

A helicopter? I thought. Is it a helicopter? Someone to rescue us? 

No. That clapping, pounding sound couldn’t be a helicopter’s roar. 

Another shadow swooped over the boat. 

And then an ugly cry ripped through the air. 

RRRAAAAAK! RRAAAAAAK! 

“Oh, no!” Dr. D. cried. “Here they come!” 

I shielded my eyes with one hand. And I saw them. 

Swooping low. Two enormous birds. Seagulls. Seagulls as big as my golden 
Lab back home! 

RRRAAAAAK! RRAAiAAAK! Their sharp cries were so shrill, they hurt my 

ears. 

“Here come two more victims of your great experiments, Ritter,” my uncle 
shouted over the pounding of their wings. 

“They must have eaten the plankton too!” Dr. Ritter exclaimed. 

The birds circled the boat. They cast huge shadows over us, their wings 
stretched out like sails. 

As I squinted up at them, they stopped circling. 

And lowered their talons. 

Are they hunting for food? I wondered, staring up at the sharp bird claws, 
gleaming in the sunlight. 

Are we the food? 

Before we could duck or try to hide, the two huge birds soared toward us. 
Talons raised. Ready to clutch their prey. 

Screeching all the way down. 



22 


I froze in panic. 

The screeching rang in my ears. Filled my brain. Made me feel as if my 
head would burst. 

I stared up at the raised talons. 

The shadows of the screeching birds washed over me. 

And then I felt a strong hand pushing me down. Down to the deck. I turned 
back and saw my uncle, his jaw set, his eyes on the sky. 

He pushed Sheena and me down. Then moved over us. Protecting us. 

I couldn’t see them. But I felt the heavy thud as the two heavy gulls landed 
on the boat. 

And then I heard the shouts of Dr. Ritter and his men. Angry shouts, over 
the shrill squawks of the birds. 

I twisted my head. Tried to see. But my uncle pushed my head down again. 
Holding his arms over Sheena and me. 

I heard a struggle behind us. More squawks. More frantic cries. 

I heard the heavy pounding of wings. 

A table fell over. Dishes crashed to the floor. 

A cry of pain. 

“Quick, kids—now’s our chance!” Dr. D. whispered. He pulled us to our 
feet. Then, protecting us with his back, he shoved us across the deck to the 
lifeboat. 

“Billy! Help me untie this thing!” Dr. D. ordered. 

The three of us struggled with the knots that held the lifeboat to the deck. 

“Hurry!” Dr. D. urged us. “Before they see what we’re up to!” 

“RRRAAAAK!” I turned and saw that one of the birds had Adam pinned 
under its sharp claws. Mel and Dr. Ritter were struggling to pull the powerful 
bird off him. 

“This knot’s undone!” Sheena announced. She worked on another knot. 

I nervously tugged at the knot in my hands. I was so scared, I couldn’t 
think. My fingers felt thick and clumsy. 

Hurry! I ordered myself. Hurry—before they catch us! 



Finally, I ripped open the last knot and pulled the lifeboat free. Dr. D. tossed 
it into the water, holding it by a rope. 

“Okay. Let’s go! Jump in! Now!” 

I gripped the rail of the motorboat and braced myself to jump. 

“Hey!” I heard a cry behind me. I turned back and saw Mel staring at us. 
“Hey—they’re getting away!” 

He motioned to us. “Stop!” he shouted. He grabbed a spear gun. “Don’t 
move!” he ordered. 

I hesitated. The sharp point of the metal spear sparkled in the sunlight. 
Would he really shoot us? 

“Go, kids! Now!” Dr. D. cried. 

Mel aimed the spear gun at my uncle—and fired. 



23 


WHOOSH! 

I couldn’t see it. It moved so fast, I could only hear the spear fly through 
the air. 

To my horror, Dr. D. slumped to the deck. 

“You—you shot him!” I shrieked. 

“Dr. D.! Dr. D.!” Sheena cried. We both hurried to his side. 

Our uncle sat up. 

“It—it missed!” He seemed surprised. He leaped to his feet. “Into the 
lifeboat, kids! ” he cried. 

A gull squawked. I heard Adam scream. Mel turned back to help him. 

I took a running jump, shut my eyes, and threw myself overboard. 

PLOP! I landed in the soft rubber boat. Sheena jumped in after me. Then 
Dr. D. 

“Stop, or I’ll shoot!” Dr. Ritter called. He picked up Mel’s spear gun and 
aimed it at us. 

A gull’s wing bumped his arm, knocking the gun into the water. 

We frantically scooped our hands through the water, paddling away from 
Dr. Ritter’s boat. 

“You can’t escape!” Dr. Ritter called after us, shaking his fist. “I’ll get 
you!” 

Dr. D. grabbed the lifeboat paddles. He started paddling with all his 
strength. The ocean pulled us away. 

The ocean turned rough and foamy. A wind kicked up and blasted us, 
churning up huge waves. The waves carried us quickly out to sea. 

Dr. Ritter’s boat faded into the distance. 

“Well, we escaped,” Sheena sighed. “But where are we going?” 

No sign of land anywhere. No sign of another boat. Nothing but water. 
Churning water and crashing waves. 

The rubber lifeboat smacked down hard on the water. “Hold on, kids,” Dr. 
D. shouted. “Here comes a big one!” 

I gripped the sides of the boat as a huge wave tossed us into the air. 



THUMP! We landed in a valley between waves. Then another wave 
smashed over us. 

I shivered, totally soaked. 

“Is everybody okay?” Dr. D. asked. Sheena and I nodded. 

Then a gigantic wave caught us from behind. 

The lifeboat bounced high in the air. I clung to the side. 

But Sheena’s hands slipped off. She flew up into the air—and disappeared 
into the white foam. 

“Sheena!” I screamed. “She fell overboard!” 

Her head bobbed up. “H-h-help!” she sputtered. She sank below again, her 
arms thrashing. 

I waited for her to bob back up. 

Waited. 

Waited. 

Please—I prayed. 

And then there she was. I leaned over the side. Leaned forward. More. 
More... 

And grabbed her arm and hauled her back into the boat. 

“Are you all right, Sheena?” Dr. D. asked. 

She coughed. Water ran down her face. “I think so.” 

Dr. D. held on to her as another big wave drenched us. 

We huddled in the lifeboat, wet, shivering, hungry, and tired. The lifeboat 
puddled with water. It was like sitting in a wading pool. 

The sky grew dark. It would be night soon. 

We’ll have to spend the night out here, I realized. Out here in the middle of 
the ocean. 

We can’t even rest. The ocean is so rough. If we let go of the boat for a 
second, we could be thrown into the sea. 

We had no food, no water. Nothing. 

“It can’t get any worse than this, can it?” I demanded. “Can it?” Sheena 
sneezed. Dr. D. said nothing. It can’t get any worse, I repeated to myself. And 
then it did. 



24 


The sky darkened to black. Then lightning crackled overhead. 

KABOOM! 

A roar of thunder shook our tiny lifeboat. 

Rain poured down on us. Heavy sheets of cold rain. 

“I don’t believe this!” Sheena wailed. She wiped strands of wet hair from 
her face. 

We sat glumly in the boat. The waves bounced us. The wind blew across 
our drenched skin. The rain hammered down on us. 

Lightning ripped across the sky. 

Dr. D. gazed up at the heavy, low clouds and frowned. “It’s not going to let 
up anytime soon,” he announced. 

Great. 

Meanwhile, the lifeboat filled up with water. 

Dr. D. tried to scoop the water out with his hands. “Help me bail, kids!” he 
ordered. “If the boat fills up too much, we’ll sink!” 

We furiously scooped the water out. But the rain filled the boat as fast as we 
could empty it. What were we going to do? 

I took off one of my sneakers and tried bailing water with it. It worked 
better than nothing. So Dr. D. and Sheena used their shoes to bail too. 

The rain roared down for hours. “I’m so tired!” I complained. I threw down 
my shoe. “I can’t bail any more water. I can’t!” 

“Don’t give up, Billy,” Dr. D. scolded. “We’ll make it.” He didn’t sound as 
if he really believed it, though. 

“Don’t worry,” he said, shouting over a boom of thunder. “We’re going to 
be all right.” 

I don’t see how, I thought. If we don’t starve to death, we’ll sink! There’s 
no one around to save us. No one... 

The rain finally stopped. By then it was night. Totally dark. No moon. No stars. 
Just a black sky blanketed by clouds. 

“I’m so cold,” Sheena whined. 

“I’m hungry,” I added. 



“I’m seasick!” Dr. D. admitted. 

“I’m all three,” I told them. “Plus thirsty, tired, and wet.” 

We all laughed. What else could we do? 

When things get this bad, it suddenly seems ridiculous! 

We huddled together for warmth. My stomach growled. 

But I was so tired... so tired. I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I fell asleep. 

I woke up with a THUMP. The boat had hit something. 

I opened my eyes. And stared out at a silvery, pale world. 

I’m dreaming, I thought. I closed my eyes again. 

But then I felt my wet clothes sticking to my skin. 

No, I realized. I’m awake. 

My eyes flew open. Sheena and Dr. D. sat up, yawning and stretching. 
“What’s happening?” Sheena murmured. 

“The boat’s not moving,” I realized. “It stopped.” 

I reached out to touch the water. Instead of water, my fingers sifted through 

sand. 

Dry land! 

“Hey!” I cried. “We’ve landed somewhere!” 

The sky lightened a little. The sun was just rising. I could begin to make out 
where we were. 

“Land!” Sheena shouted. She jumped out of the boat. “Hurray! Land! I 
don’t believe it! I don’t believe it!” 

Dr. D. stood up and stretched. “Wow! That feels good.” 

The sun shone brighter now. I threw myself on the sand. “Bake me, sun!” I 
sighed. 

“I wonder where we are,” Dr. D. said softly, gazing around. 

“Wherever we are, I hope they’ve got food,” Sheena added. 

Our lifeboat had landed on a sandy beach. Up a slope I could see a stand of 
palm trees. Other than that, nothing. No docks, no boats, no houses. 

“No sign of any people,” Dr. D. noted. “I’m going to take a look around.” 
“I’m coming too,” I said. 

“Me too!” Sheena said. 

We followed Dr. D. along the beach. We walked along the edge of the 
water. 

“Look! A coconut tree!” Sheena pointed to a tall tree on the beach. A few 



coconuts nestled in the sand beneath it. 

“Let’s open one,” she insisted. “I’m starving!” 

Dr. D. grabbed a coconut and smashed it against a rock. The coconut split 
open. 

Sheena and I pounced on it. We picked up the broken pieces and chewed 
the coconut meat. 

“Feel better?” Dr. D. asked, sipping coconut milk from the shell. 

I wiped the sweet liquid from my chin. “A little,” I said. “But I could sure 
use a hamburger. Make that two. And a double order of french fries with tons of 
catsup.” 

“Or a pizza,” Sheena added. 

“We’ll catch some fish later,” Dr. D. promised. “We can build a fire and 
cook them.” 

We continued our way around the island. 

“Maybe we’ll find a restaurant,” Sheena wished out loud. 

But after about ten minutes, Dr. D. groaned. “Oh, no!” 

“What is it?” I asked. 

“Look.” He pointed a few yards down the beach. 

Our lifeboat. We were right back where we’d started. 

“You mean, that’s it?” I asked. “We’ve seen the whole island in ten 
minutes?” 

“That’s it.” Dr. D. sighed. “It’s tiny.” 

Sheena sighed too. “I’m still hungry. And I don’t want coconuts!” 

“Looks as if we’ve landed on a deserted island,” Dr. D. said. “But don’t 
worry. We’ll find something to eat.” 

I touched my face. My skin was hot. The sun had felt so good at first—but 
now I was getting sunburned. 

Another question nagged at me. But I was so hungry, I tried to push it out of 
my mind. 

“Billy, run into that clump of palm trees,” Dr. D. ordered. “See if you can 
find some wood to build a fire.” 

I wandered into the grove, hunting for something to burn. There wasn’t 
much to be found. Mostly a lot of vines. 

And that nagging worry wouldn’t go away. 

We were stuck on a tiny island, with nothing but a rubber raft. 

And I had one question, a question I was afraid to ask out loud: 



How were we ever going to get off? 



25 


I found a few sticks and carried them back to the beach. Dr. D. was digging a pit 
for the fire. 

“Good job, Billy.” He took the sticks from me. “This will do for now.” 

Sheena was wading near the shore. I sat down on the sand. “Dr. D.—” I 
began. “What are we going to do? Do you think we’re far from the Cassandra ?” 

Dr. D. sighed. “I’m afraid I have no idea where we are,” he admitted. 

“So—what’s going to happen? Are we going to rot on this island?” I knew 
we couldn’t last long. So far, we’d had nothing to eat but coconuts. 

Dr. D. rubbed two of the sticks together, trying to get them to light. “Maybe 
someone will see our fire. Maybe a plane will fly over us, or a boat will pass by. 
Maybe someone will find the Cassandra empty and come searching for us.” 

I leaned back and gazed at the empty sky. “But that could take forever!” I 
cried. “Nobody even knows we’re missing! Except Dr. Ritter—and I don’t want 
him to find us.” 

I heard a shriek. I turned and saw Sheena running up the beach, waving 
something in one hand. 

“Look! Hey—check this out!” she shouted. “I caught a fish! I caught a fish 
with my bare hands!” 

She held out a small, wriggling silverfish. 

“It’s puny,” I said. 

“So? Let’s see you catch one!” she shot back. 

Dr. D. took the fish and set it on the sand. “It’s better than nothing.” 

“I’ll catch a bigger one,” I declared. 

Sheena and I raced back to the water. We waded in hip-high. A few small 
fish darted around us. 

“These are all pretty small,” I complained. “We need some of Dr. Ritter’s 
plankton to make them grow.” 

“I wouldn’t want to eat one of his giant fish,” Sheena replied, making a 
disgusted face. “Yuck.” 

“Maybe if we go a little deeper we’ll find bigger fish,” I suggested. 

We waded in farther. A silverfish with a black stripe swam past me. 

“That one is a little bigger,” I said. I made a grab for it. Missed. 



I tried again. I swam out a little farther, chasing the fish. 

I guess I waded out deeper than I meant to. Suddenly I felt a sharp pain in 
my foot. 

At first I thought Sheena was pinching me. But the pain quickly swept up 
my whole leg. “Hey—what’s going on?” I cried. I lowered my gaze to the water 
—and let out a frightened scream. 



26 


“Oh, nooooo!” I moaned. 

I stared down at the water—down at the creature beneath the water. 

I saw a hairy back. A brown-purple shell. Enormous pincers. 

And knew I’d been grabbed by a giant crab! 

The crab was as big as a card table. And it squeezed my toe in a pincer the 
size of my dad’s lug wrench! 

“Help!” I screeched. “Ohhhh, help!” 

The crab snapped its claws. I managed to slip my toe out of its grip. 

Slipping and stumbling, I scrambled back to shore as fast as I could. 

“A giant crab!” I shouted. “Hey—look out! It’s following me!” 

Sheena let out a gasp and came splashing out of the water. 

The giant crab scrabbled onto the sand, moving sideways, its hairy legs 
moving rapidly. 

“I don’t believe it!” Dr. D. cried. 

The crab moved toward us with amazing speed, snapping its claws. Click... 
click... CLICK. 

“Into the trees! Quick!” Dr. D. shouted. 

We ran into the palm tree grove. I scrambled up a tree, out of the crab’s 
reach. Sheena climbed up behind me. Dr. D. grabbed the branch of another tree 
and swung himself up. 

The crab watched us from below. It raised its hairy claws as if reaching for 
us. Click... CLICK. 

“If only we could cook it!” Sheena exclaimed hungrily. “That thing could 
feed us for a week!” 

“It must have eaten some of Dr. Ritter’s plankton! Its huge size has made 
this crab very hungry!” 

The crab clicked its big claws, trying to grab us. Its body heaved in and out, 
in and out. 

It stood there for what seemed like hours. 

“How long will it wait before it gives up?” I asked. 

Dr. D. shrugged. “Your guess is as good as mine.” 



I heard a crack. 

At first, I thought it was the crab claws snapping. 

Another crack. Too close to be the crab. 

Coming from right beneath Sheena and me. 

The tree branch. 

Crack. 

To my horror, I realized that Sheena and I were too heavy for it. The branch 
was breaking off the tree. 

My sister and I were about to drop into the crab’s waiting claws. 



27 


With a low cry, I reached up both arms. I tried to grab the branch above us. 

I reached... reached... 

No. My arms were too short. 

“We—we’re falling!” Sheena cried. 

With a loud craaaack, our branch broke off. 

And we tumbled down... down... onto the crab’s hairy back. 

No. 

Onto the hot sand. 

“Huh?” I gasped and spun around. 

The crab had moved away. It was scrabbling rapidly back toward the water. 
Sheena sat up, her expression still startled. 

Our uncle climbed down from his branch. “Are you two okay?” 

We watched the huge creature splash back into the ocean. 

“I’m never going back in that water,” I declared. 

“Who knows what other monsters are waiting in there!” 

“But how will we catch any fish?” Sheena wailed. “We’re going to starve to 
death!” 

Dr. D. wasn’t listening to us. He had turned away and was gazing down the 
beach. “Oh, no!” he cried. “The tide—it came in! The life raft!” 

All three of us started running to the spot where we’d left our lifeboat. But 
it was gone. 

I stared out over the ocean—and I spotted a yellow speck in the distance. 
The lifeboat. 

The tide had carried it away. 

“Now we’ll never get off this stupid island!” I cried. “Never.” 

Dr. D. didn’t reply. He didn’t need to say anything. The worried expression 
on his face said it all. 

We passed the rest of the day keeping in the shade, chewing coconut meat. 

“I’ll never eat coconut again,” Sheena whined. “Not even in candy bars!” 
We didn’t talk much. What was there to say? 



Night fell slowly. We watched the sky fade from blue to purple to black. 

Dr. D. sat up suddenly. “Did you hear that?” he asked. 

I sat up too. And listened hard. 

“What is it?” Sheena asked. 

“It’s coming from the beach,” Dr. D. said. 

We walked quickly down to the beach. Two huge animals splashed and 
played in the water. 

“Whales!” Sheena cried. 

“No—not whales,” Dr. D. said. “Dolphins!” 

The dolphins ate the plankton too, I realized. 

“What’s that yellow thing they’re playing with?” Sheena asked. “It looks 
like—” 

“It is!” I shouted. “Our lifeboat! The dolphins brought it back!” 

The lifeboat rope had tangled around the middle of one of the dolphins. 
Wherever the dolphin swam, the boat trailed behind it. 

“Let’s go rescue it!” Dr. D. cried. He splashed into the water. Sheena and I 
followed him. No time to worry about giant crabs. We had to get that raft. 

We swam out to where the dolphins played. They gurgled at us. They didn’t 
seem afraid of us at all. 

Why should they be? They were a lot bigger than we were! 

They’re only dolphins, I told myself. Dolphins don’t hurt people. 

But I was a little afraid of them. Especially since our visit from the giant 

crab. 

Dr. D. grabbed the edge of the rubber raft. Sheena and I climbed in. 

“Now, if I can just get that rope from around this dolphin...” Dr. D. 
groaned. 

He tugged on the rope. The dolphin began to swim. 

“The dolphin is carrying us away!” Sheena said. “Wait, dolphin! Stop!” 

The dolphin didn’t stop. It kept swimming, faster and harder. 

Dr. D. hauled himself into the boat. 

The island was a speck behind us now. We couldn’t swim back to it if we 
wanted to! The dolphin was carrying us far out to sea. 

“We might as well settle back and enjoy the ride,” Dr. D. said. “There’s 
nothing else we can do.” 


The dolphin pulled us all night long. The sea was calm that night. We slept in the 



boat again. 

When I opened my eyes, everything was gray. Misty. 

I heard the dolphin gurgling and chirping, as if it were talking to us. 

The sun was just about to come up. The ocean was covered with a thick 
blanket of fog. 

The dolphin poked its head over the side of the boat. It had slipped the rope 
off. It was free now. 

With a splash, it swam away. It quickly disappeared through the thick fog. 

I peered through the fog. I could barely see past the lifeboat. We were still 
in the middle of the ocean. But I thought I saw something nearby. Something big 
and white. 

Like a boat. 

My heart sank. 

Oh, no, I thought. I think I’ve seen this boat before. 

I shut my eyes again, wishing it would go away. 

I opened them. There it was. 

No! It can’t be! It’s too horrible! 

I shook Dr. D. “Wake up!” I cried. “Look where we are!” 

Dr. D. opened his eyes. “Huh?” my uncle muttered. “Where are we?” 

“The dolphin carried us back!” I wailed. “Back to Dr. Ritter’s boat!” 



28 


“Oh, no!” Sheena wailed. “Not again!” 

“What are we going to do?” I asked. 

“Shhh!” Dr. D. whispered. “Stay calm. They don’t know we’re here. Maybe 
we can get away somehow.” 

“Get away?” I exclaimed. “To where?” 

“I can’t stay on this raft another minute!” Sheena insisted. “I want to go 
home!” 

“That stupid dolphin!” I muttered. “I thought dolphins were supposed to be 
smart! I can’t believe it pulled us to Dr. Ritter’s boat.” 

The fog surrounded us like a thick gray curtain. It swept in and out, making 
Dr. Ritter’s boat appear to shimmer. 

The rubber raft drifted closer to the boat. I could almost touch the side of 
the bow. 

I thought I saw a word printed there. I did. The name of the boat. 

I strained to read it. I could make out the first few letters. 

C-A-S... 

Huh? 

“Dr. D.!” I cried. “It’s not Dr. Ritter’s boat. It’s our boat! It’s the 
Cassandra !” 

Dr. D. squinted. “Yes!” he cried. “You’re right, Billy!” 

We were safe! Sheena and I jumped up and danced around. 

“We’re home! We’re home! We’re home!” we sang. 

The lifeboat bounced under our feet. “Whoa!” I cried. We nearly tipped it 

over! 

“Sit down, kids,” Dr. D. said. “We’re two feet from safety. We don’t want to 
drown now.” 

We paddled the rubber raft to our boat and dragged ourselves aboard. 

I was so tired. But I couldn’t help doing another little dance on the deck of 
the Cassandra. 

Sheena slapped me five. “Nothing can stop us!” she cried happily. “Not a 
stormy night on the high seas! Not getting stranded on an empty island! 



Nothing!” 

Dr. D. laughed. “I can’t wait to take a shower and go to bed. But first—I’m 
cooking us all a big breakfast.” 

“Pancakes!” I suggested. 

“Pancakes and waffles!” Sheena cried. 

“Breakfast is going to have to wait,” a deep voice said. We all froze. 

Dr. Ritter stepped out of the cabin. “You won’t be hungry much longer,” he 
sneered. 



29 


“I can’t take this!” Sheena wailed. Tears formed in her eyes. 

“Quiet!” Dr. Ritter snapped. 

Dr. D. laid a hand on Sheena’s shoulder and shushed her. “Where are your 
assistants?” he asked Dr. Ritter. 

“That’s none of your business. I don’t need them now. I can take care of 
you myself,” Dr. Ritter replied. “You’re all very tired and weak, aren’t you? 
Even you, Dr. D. That’s what happens when you don’t eat for two days.” 

I glanced at Dr. D. It was true. He looked exhausted. 

“Go ahead,” Dr. Ritter went on. “Get back in the lifeboat. I dare you.” 

My eyes fell on the rubber boat. Dr. Ritter knew what he was doing. I 
would rather have eaten fish guts with horseradish than get back in that thing. 

“What do you want now, Ritter?” Dr. D.’s voice was tired, but angry. “Why 
did you wait here for us?” 

Dr. Ritter scowled. “I can’t let you live. I can’t let you tell the world about 
my plankton.” 

“We promised we wouldn’t tell!” Sheena cried. “Look—cross my heart and 
hope to die.” She crossed her heart and held up her hand, Girl Scout-style. 

Dr. Ritter laughed. “You’re very amusing. I’m so sorry it has to end this 
way. Really, I am.” 

The sun finally burned through the fog. I shivered. I wasn’t cold and wet 
anymore. But Dr. Ritter was giving me chills. 

“All of you—down to the lab,” Dr. Ritter ordered. “Go!” 

He forced us downstairs. Into my uncle’s lab. 

Dr. Ritter stood in front of the cabinet—the one that held the plankton 
bottles. 

“I believe these are the plankton samples you collected, Dr. Deep,” he said. 
“Am I right?” 

Dr. D. nodded. 

“Good. You’ve gathered a lot of my work. You must have been very 
interested in it.” 

“Of course I was,” Dr. D. said. “I’m a scientist.” 

“Yes,” Dr. Ritter hissed. “You’re a scientist. You want to learn more—am I 



right?” 

Dr. D. nodded slowly. 

“Excellent. You asked me earlier about the side effects of my plankton 
experiments, Dr. Deep. About the few kinks I haven’t worked out yet. I think 
now is the time to show you what they are.” 

Dr. Ritter opened the glass door of the cabinet. “When fish eat the plankton, 
they grow huge.” He pointed to the bottles of plankton lined up on the shelves. 

“You’ve already seen that, haven’t you? But what do you think happens 
when a human eats the plankton? Billy? Want to take a guess?” Dr. Ritter asked. 

I took a stab at it. “Um—they grow into giant people?” 

“Wrong!” Dr. Ritter cried. “Sheena? What do you think?” 

Sheena shrugged. “I couldn’t care less.” 

“You should care, Sheena,” Dr. Ritter said. “Because whatever happens, it’s 
going to happen to you.” 

He turned to my uncle. “Dr. Deep? Any guesses? Or have you already 
figured it out in your research?” 

“Just tell us what happens, Ritter,” Dr. D. snapped impatiently. 

“All right. I’ll tell you. When a human eats the plankton, he turns into a 
fish!” 

“Excuse me?” I cried. 

“Is this fairy-tale time?” my uncle groaned. 

Dr. Ritter ignored us. “The human becomes a fish!” he repeated. “Almost 
instantly! And that person will remain a fish—for the rest of his life.” 

“That’s impossible!” Dr. D. protested. “You’re crazy, Ritter. Let us take you 
to shore and get you some help.” 

“I’ll show you who’s crazy,” Dr. Ritter declared. “I’ll prove it to you!” 

He grabbed me by the back of the neck. 

“Hey! Let go!” I shouted. 

He didn’t say a word. He just shoved me up to the glass cabinet. He shoved 
my face close to a row of bottles. Bottle after bottle filled with murky brown 
plankton. 

“Take a bottle, Billy,” he ordered. “Any bottle.” 

He pushed me again, until my forehead nearly knocked a bottle over. Then 
he let go. 

“Go ahead,” he repeated. “Choose one.” 

“Why?” I asked. “Why do you want me to take a bottle?” 



“I’ll tell you why,” Dr. Ritter said. “Because you’re going to drink it, Billy. 
All of it.” 



30 


I stared at the bottles. 

“Take one, Billy,” Dr. Ritter insisted. “Or I’ll take one and pour it down 
your throat.” 

I had no choice. 

I reached up and picked the last one from the middle shelf. 

I stared at it. Disgusting brown and green glop. 

Not exactly the breakfast I had in mind. 

“Wait till you see this, Dr. Deep,” Dr. Ritter said. He stared at me. His eyes 
gleaming. 

“The growth hormone reacted strangely with the plankton,” Dr. Ritter 
explained. “As soon as the boy drinks it, heTl turn into a fish. It takes only a 
minute or two.” 

He grabbed the bottle from me. He opened it and handed it back. 

“Drink.” 

I lifted the bottle to my lips. 

“No!” Sheena cried. 

Dr. D. covered the lip of the bottle with one hand. 

“Wait, Billy,” he said. “This is ridiculous, Dr. Ritter. Stop this silliness 
immediately. And let us go.” 

“I can’t do that. I already explained why,” Dr. Ritter answered. 

“You need help, Dr. Ritter,” Dr. D. said. “You’re not thinking clearly. 
You’re a brilliant man. You could be a great scientist.” 

“I am a great scientist,” Dr. Ritter insisted. “I’m about to prove that to you 
right now! Drink, Billy!” 

Dr. D.’s hand still covered the bottle. 

Thank you, Dr. D., I thought. 

“You can’t be a great scientist if you hurt people,” Dr. D. insisted. “Let us 
go. We’ll get you the help you need. Then you can change the world for the 
better.” 

“You’re an idiot, Dr. Deep,” Dr. Ritter sneered. “You’ll be the next one to 
turn into a fish. Just as soon as I finish with the boy.” 



He swatted Dr. D.’s hand away from the bottle. “Drink that plankton now, 
Billy,” he commanded. “Or I’ll throw you all overboard.” 

I swished the brown liquid in the bottle. 

I gulped. 

It looked so gross. 

But what was my choice? Drown or drink... 

My hand trembled as I raised the bottle to my lips. And I drank it down. 



31 


I made a disgusted face. My whole body shook. 

Then I stood there stiffly. Every muscle tensed. Waiting. 

The others stared at me. They didn’t move, either. 

Sheena’s chin trembled. “I don’t want you to turn into a fish, Billy! Why 
did you drink it? Why didn’t you throw it on the floor?” 

“He would just pick out another bottle for me,” I replied hoarsely. I could 
still taste the liquid in my mouth. I felt it gurgling around in my stomach. 

At least a minute passed. Then another minute. 

“Okay,” Dr. Ritter said. “It should happen—now!” 

He pointed at me. I stood there. I was still a boy. 

“I don’t see any changes,” Dr. D. said. 

“Give it another minute,” Dr. Ritter insisted. “I know it works. I tried it on 
my assistant, Mel, last night. He’s swimming around out there playing tag with a 
blue marlin right now!” 

The room fell silent as we all waited for me to turn into a fish. 

My stomach felt a little queasy. Otherwise, nothing. 

I sighed and shifted my feet. 

“It’s been more than five minutes, Ritter,” Dr. D. said. “Looks like your 
plankton doesn’t work.” 

Dr. Ritter scowled furiously. “No! That’s impossible! It works! I know it 
works!” 

He grabbed me and shook me. “Fish! Turn into a fish!” 

I bumped him away. He toppled backwards. 

Dr. D. pounced on him. “Gotcha!” 

Dr. Ritter pushed him off. And grabbed a bottle of plankton. 

He raised the bottle over his head. 

“Look out, Dr. D.!” Sheena cried. 

Dr. Ritter swung the bottle. 

Dr. D. ducked. 

I snatched the bottle from Dr. Ritter’s hand. 

My uncle leaped at Dr. Ritter. Dr. Ritter dodged him and dashed out of the 



lab. 


“He’s going up on deck!” Sheena shouted. 

We raced after him. Dr. D. tackled Dr. Ritter on the deck. Dr. Ritter rolled 
away. He jumped on Dr. D. 

They wrestled around. I set the bottle of plankton down. 

“Get off him!” I yelled. I tried to pull Dr. Ritter off my uncle. 

Dr. Ritter elbowed me away. Dr. D. grabbed him. They rolled across the 
deck. 

“Dr. D.—look out!” I screamed. He was about to roll overboard. 

With a grunt, Dr. D. jumped to his feet. He dove on Dr. Ritter and pinned 
him to the deck. 

“Get a rope, Billy! Quick!” he ordered. 

I grabbed the first rope I found on the deck. “Tie him up!” Dr. D. ordered. 
“Sheena—help me hold him down.” 

Sheena took a running start and leaped on top of Dr. Ritter. 

Dr. Ritter grunted. “My stomach!” 

Sheena sat on top of him. Dr. D. pinned his arms down. I wrapped the rope 
around his wrists. 

Dr. D. had taught me some sailor’s knots the summer before. My mind 
raced, trying to remember them. 

How did it go? I thought in a panic. Over, under, around? 

Dr. Ritter squirmed under Sheena. “Hurry, Billy!” she snapped. 

“I’m trying!” I said. 

“It’s over, Ritter,” Dr. D. said. “We’re taking you to the International Sea 
Life Patrol.” 

Over, under, over? 

“No, you’re not!” Dr. Ritter cried. He bucked Sheena off. 

She tumbled to the deck. 

He wrenched his hands from the rope and shoved Dr. D. away. 

My crummy knots were useless. 

Dr. D. tried to grab him. But Dr. Ritter dove away and crawled across the 
deck. He snatched up a bottle of plankton. 

He stood and waved the bottle at us. “You’ll never turn me in!” he declared. 

Then he pulled the bottle open, tilted it over his mouth, and drank it down. 



32 


“It works!” Dr. Ritter declared. “I’ll prove it to you!” 

He tossed the bottle aside. The glass smashed on the deck. 

“You can’t fool us, Dr. Ritter,” Sheena said. “We know that stuff doesn’t 
work. We saw Billy drink it.” 

But Dr. Ritter’s body began to tremble. Quickly, his skin began to darken to 
a slivery, blue-gray. 

“Something’s happening!” Dr. D. exclaimed. 

Dr. Ritter’s skin began to flake. Then it turned scaly. It glittered in the 
sunlight. 

His body began to shrink. His clothes slid off the slick scales. His hair fell 
away. His head flattened. His whole body shrank and flattened. 

“It’s working!” I gasped. “He’s turning into a fish!” 

Dr. Ritter’s arms shriveled into fins. His legs melted together, melted into a 
fish tail. 

He flopped on the deck. One flat eye stared glassily up at us as he flapped 
his tail. 

“He’s a fish!” Sheena cried. “I don’t believe it!” 

With one great flip of his tail, the fish plopped over the side of the deck and 
into the water. 

We watched him as he dove under the surface. 

“Stop him!” I shouted. “He’s getting away! We can’t let him escape!” I 
started for my snorkeling flippers. 

But Dr. D. squeezed my shoulder. “No, Billy. It’s okay. Let him go.” 

“Huh? Why?” 

“You heard what he told us, Billy. Dr. Ritter will be a fish forever,” Dr. D. 
explained. “He can’t do anyone any harm now.” 

I stared down at the silvery fish. It splashed its tail in the water and swam 
out to sea. 

“Wow,” Sheena gasped, pressing her hands against her cheeks. 

Dr. D. put his arms around us. “I guess that adventure is over,” he sighed. “I 
was never so scared in my life.” 



Sheena and I agreed. “I’m scared—and amazed,” I told my uncle. “I’ll 
never forget the strange things we saw this week.” 

We followed Dr. D. down to help him prepare breakfast. He stopped in his 
lab. 

“What a mess,” he sighed. “I guess I’ll clean it up later.” 

Sheena walked over to the cabinet of plankton bottles. She turned to me and 
narrowed her eyes at me. “Hey, Billy—you drank a bottle of plankton too.” 

I shrugged. “Yeah. So?” 

“So why didn’t you turn into a fish like Dr. Ritter did?” she demanded. 

“You know why,” I teased. 

“I do not.” 

“Yes, you do. It’s because I’m not human. I’m superhuman.” 

She punched me in the stomach. “Come on. Tell me the real reason.” 

Dr. D. folded his arms across his chest. “Yes, Billy. Tell us. I’d be interested 
to hear this.” 

I grinned. “Well, it’s all thanks to you, Sheena.” 

“Me?” 

“Uh-huh. I was really angry after you played that trick on me. You know, 
the doll’s head in the goldfish bowl?” 

Sheena giggled. 

“Ha-ha. Hilarious. Anyway, I spent all day and all night trying to think up a 
good trick to play on you. To get you back.” 

“That’s all you ever do, Billy,” Sheena said. “What’s so different about 
that?” 

I tapped the cabinet. “I had a great idea. I took one of the plankton bottles 
and dumped the plankton out.” 

Dr. D. grimaced. “You what?” 

“Sorry, Dr. D.,” I said. “I figured you had so many, you wouldn’t miss one.” 

“I still don’t get it,” Sheena said. “Then what?” 

“I washed out the bottle. Then I poured iced tea into it,” I explained. “I was 
going to bring you in here and say, ‘Hey, Sheena! Want to see me drink 
plankton?’ Then I’d gulp down the iced tea and totally gross you out!” 

“That wouldn’t have grossed me out,” Sheena protested. 

“Yes, it would!” I insisted. “You would’ve puked all over the cabin floor!” 

“No, I wouldn’t!” 

Dr. D. interrupted us. “You planted a bottle of iced tea in the plankton 



cabinet? So when Dr. Ritter told you to choose a bottle...” 

“Right!” I cried. “I picked the bottle of iced tea!” 

Sheena laughed. She laughed so hard, she almost choked. 

“I know it’s funny,” I said. “But even I don’t think it’s that funny.” 

She hiccupped and caught her breath. “I don’t believe it,” she gasped. “You 
and I are starting to think alike, Billy.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I played the same trick on you!” she cried. “The exact same trick! I put 
iced tea in a bottle too. Watch!” 

She pulled a bottle from an end of the cabinet, ripped off the stopper, and 
gulped it down. 

Dr. D. and I gaped at her in shock. 

Sheena made a weird face. Her eyes bulged. She grabbed her stomach. 

“Oh, wow,” she groaned. “Did I drink the right bottle?”

THE HAUNTED SCHOOL 


Goosebumps - 59 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


An invisible hand grabbed me and pulled me off the ladder. 

I landed on my back on the gym floor with an “Oooof! ” My head made a 
loud THUD as it banged the floorboards. 

I raised myself slowly, blinking hard, trying to shake off the shock. Then I 
pulled myself up on my elbows and saw Ben Jackson laughing. 

Thalia Halpert-Rodis dropped her lipstick into her bag and came running 
over to me. “Tommy—are you okay?” she demanded. 

“Yeah. Fine,” I muttered. “I was just testing the floor. You know. Seeing 
how hard it is.” 

“It isn’t as hard as your head!” Ben joked. “You’re going to have to pay for 
breaking the gym floor!” He laughed again. 

“Ha-ha.” Thalia rolled her eyes, then made a disgusted face at him. She 
turned to me. “Don’t encourage him, Tommy. He’s about as funny as a dead 
pigeon.” 

“I think dead pigeons are funny!” Ben insisted. 

Thalia rolled her eyes again. Then she grabbed my hand and tugged me to 
my feet. 

I felt so embarrassed. I wanted to go hide under the bleachers. 

Why am I always such a total klutz? 

No invisible hand pulled me off the ladder. I just fell. That’s what I usually 
do if I find myself on a ladder. I fall off. 

Some people are climbers. I’m a fallen 

But I really didn’t want to look like a geek in front of Thalia and Ben. After 
all, I just met them. And I really wanted to impress them. 

That’s why I signed up for the Dance Decorations Committee. I wanted to 
meet kids. It’s hard to make new friends when you start a new school in sixth 
grade. 

Maybe I’d better start at the beginning. 

My name is Tommy Frazer and I’m twelve. Just before school started this 
fall, my dad got married again. And right after the wedding, we moved to Bell 
Valley. 

We had to move so fast, I barely had a chance to say good-bye to my 



friends. And before I could catch my breath, here I was—the new kid at Bell 
Valley Middle School. 

I didn’t know anyone here. I hardly even knew my new mom! 

Can you imagine what it’s like to suddenly have a new school, a new house, 
and a new mom? 

The first couple of days at Bell Valley Middle School were hard. Kids 
weren’t unfriendly. But they already knew who their friends were. 

I’m not shy. But it was really impossible to just go up to someone and say, 
“Hi. Want to be my friend?” 

I was pretty lonely the first week or so. Then last Monday morning, Mrs. 
Borden, the principal, came into our room. She asked if anyone wanted to 
volunteer for the Dance Decorations Committee. She needed kids to decorate the 

gym. 

My hand was the first to shoot up. I knew it would be a great way to make 
new friends. 

So here I was after school in the gym two days later. Making new friends by 
falling on my head like a geek. 

“Do you think you should see the nurse?” Thalia asked, studying me. 

“No. My eyes always roll around like this,” I replied weakly. At least I still 
had my sense of humor. 

“The nurse left, anyway,” Ben said, checking his watch. “It’s late. We’re 
probably the only ones in the building.” 

Thalia shook out her blond hair. “Let’s get back to work,” she suggested. 

She opened her bag and pulled out her lipstick. I watched her apply a thick 
coat of red to her lips, even though they were already red. Then she brushed 
some kind of orangey powder on her cheeks. 

Ben shook his head but didn’t say anything. 

Yesterday, I heard other kids teasing Thalia about her makeup and lipstick. 
They said she was the only girl in sixth grade who uses that stuff every day. 

They were pretty mean to her. One girl said, “Thalia thinks she’s painting a 
masterpiece.” 

Another girl said, “Thalia couldn’t go to gym class because she had to wait 
for her face to dry.” 

A boy said, “Her face must be broken. That’s why she’s always fixing it!” 

Everyone laughed really hard. 

Thalia didn’t seem to mind all the jokes and teasing. I guess she’s used to it. 



Before school this morning, I heard some kids saying that Thalia was stuck- 
up. That she thought she was soooo beautiful, and that’s why she was always 
paying so much attention to her looks. 

She didn’t seem stuck-up to me. She seemed really nice. She was pretty 
awesome looking too. I wondered why she thought she needed to wear makeup 
at all. 

Thalia and Ben look a lot alike. They could be brother and sister, but 
they’re not. 

They are both tall and thin. And they both have blue eyes and curly blond 

hair. 

I’m short and a little chubby. And I have black hair that sticks straight out 
like straw. It’s real tough hair. I can brush it for hours, but it still goes wherever it 
wants. 

My new mom says I’ll be really handsome as soon as I lose my baby fat. I 
don’t think that was a very good compliment. 

Anyway, Thalia, Ben, and I were painting some big banners to go up on the 
gym wall. Thalia and I were working together on a banner that read BELL 
VALLEY ROCKS! 

Ben started to paint a poster that read DANCE TILL YOU PUKE! But Mrs. 
Borden poked her head in and asked him to think of a better slogan. 

He groaned and grumbled and started over. Now his poster read 
WELCOME, EVERYONE! 

“Hey—where’s the red paint?” Thalia called to Ben. 

“Huh?” He was down on his hands and knees, using a thick brush to paint 
the w in WELCOME. 

Thalia and I were also down on the floor, painting the black outlines to our 
poster. She climbed to her feet and stared down at Ben. “Didn’t you bring any 
red paint down to the gym? I only see black.” 

“I thought you were bringing it,” he replied. He pointed to a stack of cans 
under the basketball hoop. “What are those?” 

“All black,” she told him. “I asked you to bring down some red— 
remember? I want to put red in the middle of the letters. Black and red are the 
school colors, you know.” 

“Duh,” Ben muttered. “Well, I’m not going upstairs for it, Thalia. The art 
room is on the third floor.” 

“I’ll go!” I volunteered, a bit too eagerly. 



They both stared at me. 

“I mean, I don’t mind,” I added. “I can use the exercise.” 

“You really did hit your head—didn’t you!” Ben joked. 

“Do you remember where the art room is?” Thalia asked. 

I set down my brush. “Yeah. I think so. You go up the stairs in back— 
right?” 

Thalia nodded. Her curly blond hair bounced whenever she moved her 
head. “Right. You go up three flights to the top floor. Then you go straight down 
the hall to the back. Turn right. Then turn right again. And it’s at the back.” 

“No problem,” I said. I started jogging to the double gym doors. 

“Bring at least two cans!” she called after me. “And some clean brushes.” 

“And bring me a Coke!” Ben called. He laughed. 

What a joker. 

I started running at full speed to the exit. I’m not sure why I started to run. I 
guess I was trying to impress Thalia. 

I lowered my shoulder. And burst through the double doors. 

And barreled at full speed into a girl standing in the hall. 

“Hey—!” She let out a startled cry as we both toppled to the floor. 

I landed on top of her with a groan. 

Her head made a loud CRACK as it hit the concrete floor. 

Stunned, we both lay there for a second. Then I rolled off her and 
scrambled to my feet. 

“Sorry,” I managed to choke out. I reached out to help her up. 

But she angrily shoved my hand away and climbed up without my help. 

As she stood, I saw that she was at least a foot taller than me. Tall and 
broad-shouldered and powerful looking, she reminded me of those women 
wrestlers on TV. 

She had white-blond hair, which had fallen over her face. She was dressed 
all in black. And she stared at me furiously with steel-gray eyes. 

Frightening eyes. 

“I’m really sorry,” I repeated, taking a step back as I stared up at her. 

She took a heavy step toward me. Then another. Those cold gray eyes froze 
me against the wall. 

She scowled. And moved closer. 

“Wh-what are you going to do?” I stammered.

I pressed my back tight against the wall. “What are you going to do?” I repeated. 

“I’m going to walk home—if you’ll ever let me!” she growled. She spun 
away, her hands squeezed into big fists. 

“I said I was sorry!” I called after her. 

She vanished up the stairs without turning back. 

Those weird gray eyes stayed in my mind. 

I gave her time to leave the building. Then I started up the stairs. 

It was a long climb to the top floor. My legs still felt a little shaky from 
mnning into that strange girl. And it was kind of eerie, being the only person up 
here. 

My shoes thudded on the hard steps, and the sound thundered in the empty 
stairwell. The halls stretched out like long, dark tunnels. 

I was out of breath when I finally reached the landing on the third floor. I 
started down the hall, humming to myself. My voice sounded hollow in the 
empty hall. It echoed off the long row of gray lockers. 

I stopped humming as I made my first right turn. I passed an empty 
teachers’ lounge. A computer lab. Then some rooms that looked empty. 

Another right turn took me into a narrow hall with wooden floors that 
creaked and groaned under my shoes. 

I stopped outside the room at the end of the hall. A small hand-lettered sign 
beside the door read ART ROOM. 

I grabbed the doorknob and started to pull open the door. 

But I stopped when I heard voices inside the room. 

Startled, I gripped the doorknob and listened. I heard a boy and a girl. They 
were talking softly. I couldn’t make out their words. But the kids sounded like 
Thalia and Ben. 

What are they doing up here? I wondered. 

Why did they follow me? How did they get up here before I did? 

I pushed open the door and stepped inside. “Hey, guys—” I called. “What’s 
going on?” 

My mouth dropped open. The room was empty. 

“Hey—” I called. “Are you guys in here?” 



No reply. 

My eyes darted around the big room. Golden afternoon sunlight poured in 
through the windows. 

The long art tables stood clean and empty. Some clay pots were drying on 
the window ledge. A mobile made of wire hangers and soup cans hung from the 
ceiling light. 

Weird, I thought, shaking my head. I heard voices in here. I know I did. 

Are Thalia and Ben playing a little joke on me? I wondered. Are they 
hiding up here? 

I made my way quickly to the big supply closet and pulled open the door. 
“Caught you!” I cried. 

No. No one in there. 

I stared into the dark closet. Am I starting to hear voices? I wondered. 
Maybe my fall off the ladder was worse than I’d thought! 

I reached up and pulled the chain to turn on the closet light. On both sides 
of me, shelves of art supplies reached to the ceiling. I spotted the red paint we 
needed and started to slide a few cans off the shelf. 

But I stopped when I heard a girl laugh. 

Then a boy said something. He sounded excited. He was talking rapidly. 
But I couldn’t make out the words. 

I spun back to the art room. No one there. 

“Hey—where are you?” I called. 

Silence now. 

I pulled a paint can off the shelf and tucked it under my arm. Then I 
grabbed another can with my free hand. 

“Hey—!” I called out when I heard the voices again. 

“This isn’t funny!” I cried. “Where are you hiding?” 

No reply. 

They must be in the next room, I decided. I carried the paint cans out into 
the art room and set them down on the teacher’s desk. Then I crept into the hall. 

I stopped at the next door and poked my head into the room. It was some 
kind of storage room. Boxes marked fragile were stacked against one wall. 

No one there. 

I checked the room across the hall. No one there, either. 

As I walked back to the art room, I heard the voices again. 

The girl was shouting now. And then the boy shouted too. 



It sounded as if they were calling for help. But for some reason their voices 
seemed muffled, kind of far away. 

My heart started to beat a little faster. My throat suddenly felt dry. 

Who is playing this joke on me? I wondered. Everyone has gone home. The 
whole building is empty. So who is up here? And why can’t I find them? 

“Ben? Thalia?” I shouted. My voice echoed off the long wall of gray 
lockers. “Are you up here?” 

Silence. 

I took a deep breath and stepped back into the art room. I’m just going to 
ignore them, I decided. 

I hoisted up the two cans of paint and made my way back out into the hall. I 
glanced quickly both ways, thinking I might see Thalia and Ben. 

A shadow leaned out from an open doorway. 

I froze and stared. 

“Who—who’s there?” I called. 



3 


A man backed out of the doorway, pulling a large vacuum cleaner. He wore a 
gray uniform and had the stub of an unlit cigar clenched in his teeth. 

The janitor. 

I sighed and made my way to the stairs. I don’t think he saw me. 

The stairway curved halfway down. I started down the steps, but I stopped 
in front of a large bulletin board on the wall. I glanced over the notices of school 
events, a calendar, and a lost-and-found list. 

Oh, wow. I’m in trouble. I don’t remember seeing this on my way up, I told 
myself. 

I gazed back up to the top of the stairs. Did I take the wrong stairway? Will 
these stairs take me back to the gym? 

Only one way to find out, I decided. 

Gripping the paint cans tightly, I turned and continued down. 

To my surprise, the stairs ended at the second floor. 

I gazed down a long hallway, searching for stairs to take me to the gym in 
the basement. But I saw only closed classroom doors and long rows of metal 
lockers. 

The paint cans started to feel heavy. My shoulders ached. I set the cans on 
the floor and took a moment to stretch my arms. 

Then I picked up the cans and started walking again, my footsteps ringing 
in the empty hall. I glanced into the rooms I passed. 

Whoa! 

A skeleton grinned at me from a doorway. 

My mouth dropped open. But I quickly got myself together. “Probably 
some kind of science lab,” I murmured. 

I thought I saw a small black cat lurking at the end of a row of lockers. I 
stopped and squinted down at it. Not a cat. Somebody’s black wool ski cap. 

“Tommy—what is your problem?” I said out loud. 

I never realized how creepy a school building can be after everyone has left. 
Especially a totally unfamiliar school building. 

I turned the corner into another long, empty hall. Still no stairs in sight. 

Ben and Thalia must wonder what happened to me, I thought. They must 



think I got lost. 

Well... I am lost. 

I passed a display case of shiny sports trophies. A red-and-black pennant 
draped over the case proclaimed GO, BISONS. 

That’s our team name. The Bell Valley Bisons. 

Aren’t bisons big and very slow? And aren’t they almost extinct? 

What a lame team name! 

I continued down the hall, thinking hard. Thinking of better team names. 
The Bell Valley Hippos... the Bell Valley Warthogs... the Bell Valley Water 
Buffalos... 

That last one made me laugh. 

But I stopped laughing when I realized I’d reached the end of the hall. A 
dead end. 

“Hey—!” I called out, my eyes searching the closed doors. Shouldn’t there 
be a stairway here? Some kind of exit? 

There appeared to be a narrow doorway. But it was boarded up. Old, rotting 
boards had been nailed over the entire opening. 

I never should have volunteered to get the paint, I told myself. This school 
building is too big, and I don’t know my way around. 

Thalia and Ben are probably fed up by now. 

I gazed down the long hall. Two unmarked doors stood side by side against 
one wall. They didn’t appear to be classroom doors. 

I decided to try one. 

I leaned forward and pushed a door with my shoulder. And stumbled into a 
large, dimly lit room. 

“Whoa—where am I?” My voice sounded small and shrill. Squinting into 
the gray light, I saw a crowd of kids staring back at me! 



4 


The kids stared back at me so stiffly, so still... still as statues. 

And then I realized they were statues! 

Statues of kids. At least two dozen of them. 

They were old-fashioned looking. Their clothes were funny, like from an 
old movie. The boys wore sports jackets and very wide neckties. The girls’ 
jackets all had wide shoulder pads. Their skirts came down to their ankles. 

I lowered the paint cans to the floor. Then I took a few cautious steps into 
the room. 

The statues were so real looking, so lifelike. More like department-store 
mannequins than statues. Their glass eyes glistened. Their red mouths were set 
sternly, not smiling. 

I stepped up to the statue of a boy about my age and grabbed the sleeve of 
his jacket. Real cloth. Not sculpted stone or plaster. 

It was so dark in the room. Hard to see clearly. 

I reached into the pocket of my khakis and pulled out my red plastic lighter. 

I know, I know. I’m not supposed to have a lighter. There’s no reason why I 
would have one except my grandfather gave me the lighter a few weeks before 
he died. And I’ve carried it around with me as a good luck charm ever since. 

I flicked the lighter and raised the flame to the boy’s face. The skin was so 
real. It even had tiny pimples on one cheek and a scar under the chin. 

I closed the lighter and slipped it back in my pocket. Then I touched the 
boy’s face. Smooth and cool, carved or molded out of some kind of plaster. 

I rubbed my finger over one of his eyes. Some kind of glass or plastic. 

I tugged at the back of his dark brown hair. It started to slide off. 

A wig. 

Beside him stood a statue of a tall, thin girl in a black sweater, and a long, 
straight black skirt down to her ankles. I gazed up into her dark, shiny eyes. She 
appeared to stare back at me. 

So sad. Her expression seemed so sad to me. 

Why weren’t any of these statues smiling? 

I squeezed her hand. Cool plaster. 

Why are these statues here? I wondered. Who put them here in this hidden 



room? Is it some sort of art project? 

I stepped back—and spotted an engraved sign over the door. My eyes 
moved quickly over the big, block letters: 

CLASS OF 1947 

I stared at the sign. Read it again. Then I turned back to the roomful of 
statues. And one of the statues called out: “What are you doing here?” 



5 


“Huh?” I let out a loud gasp. 

“What are you doing in here, young man?” the voice repeated. 

Blinking hard, I whirled around. 

And saw Mrs. Borden, the principal, standing in the open doorway. 

“You—you’re not a statue!” I blurted out. 

She moved quickly into the room, holding a clipboard against the front of 
her sweater. “No, I’m not,” she replied without smiling. 

She glanced down at the two paint cans on the floor. Then she stepped up 
beside me, her eyes studying me. 

Mrs. Borden is very short. She is only an inch or two taller than me. And 
she’s kind of chubby. She has curly black hair and a round, pink face. She 
always seems to be blushing. 

Some kids told me that she’s really nice. I met her only for a moment when 
I showed up at Bell Valley my first morning. 

That morning, she was all upset about a pack of dogs that were swarming 
over the playground and frightening the little kids. She didn’t have time to talk to 
me. 

Now she stood so close to me, I could smell the peppermint on her breath. 
“Tommy, I think you must be lost,” she said softly. 

I nodded. “Yeah. I guess,” I murmured. 

“Where are you supposed to be?” she asked, still clutching the clipboard to 
her chest. 

“The gym,” I replied. 

She finally smiled. “You’re a long way from the gym. This is the entrance 
to the old building. The gym is in the new building, way on the other side.” She 
gestured with the clipboard. 

“I took the wrong stairs,” I explained. “I was coming from the art room, and 

55 

“Oh, right. You’re on the Dance Decorations Committee,” she interrupted. 
“Well, let me show you how to get back downstairs.” 

I turned to the statues. They all stood so still, so silently. They seemed to be 
eavesdropping on Mrs. Borden and me. 



“What is this room?” I asked. 

She put a hand on my shoulder and started to move me toward the door. 
“It’s a private room,” she said softly. 

“But what is it?” I repeated. “I mean—these statues. Who are these kids? 
Are they real kids or something?” 

She didn’t reply. Her hand tightened on my shoulder as she guided me to 
the door. 

I stopped to pick up the paint cans. When I glanced back at Mrs. Borden, 
her expression had changed. 

“This is a very sad room, Tommy,” she said, her voice just above a whisper. 
“These kids were the very first class in the school.” 

“The class of nineteen forty-seven?” I asked, glancing at the sign. 

The principal nodded. “Yes. Just about fifty years ago. There were twenty- 
five kids in the school. And one day... one day, they all disappeared.” 

“Huh?” Startled by her words, I dropped the paint cans to the floor. 

“They vanished, Tommy,” Mrs. Borden continued, turning her gaze to the 
statues. “Vanished into thin air. One minute they were here in school. The next 
minute, they were gone... forever. Never seen again.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. I didn’t know what to say. How could twenty- 
five kids vanish? 

Mrs. Borden sighed. “It was a terrible tragedy,” she said softly. “A terrible 
mystery. The parents... the poor parents...” 

Her voice caught in her throat. She took a deep breath. “They were so 
heartbroken. The parents had the school boarded up. Closed forever. The town 
built a new school around it. The old building has stood empty ever since that 
horrible day.” 

“And these statues?” I asked. 

“A local artist made them,” Mrs. Borden replied. “He used a class photo. A 
photo of everyone. The artist used the photo to make these statues. A tribute to 
the missing children.” 

I stared at the roomful of statues. Kids. Vanished kids. 

“Weird,” I muttered. 

I picked up the paint cans. Mrs. Borden opened the door. 

“I—I didn’t mean to come in here,” I apologized. “I didn’t know...” 

“No problem,” she replied. “This building is very big and very confusing.” 

I led the way out to the hall. She closed the door carefully behind us. 



“Follow me,” she said. The heels of her shoes clicked loudly on the hard floor as 
she walked, swinging the clipboard at her side. 

She walked really fast for a tiny person. Holding a paint can in each hand, I 
had to struggle to keep up with her. 

“How are you getting along, Tommy?” she asked. “Aside from getting lost, 
I mean.” 

“Fine,” I said. “Everyone’s been really great.” 

We turned a corner. I had to jog to catch up to her. We turned another 
corner. Into a brighter hallway. The tile walls were a bright yellow. The linoleum 
floor gleamed. 

“This is where you meant to go,” Mrs. Borden announced. “And there is the 
stairway down to the gym.” She pointed the way, then smiled at me. 

I thanked her and hurried off. 

I couldn’t wait to get back to the gym. I hoped Thalia and Ben weren’t 
angry about how long it took me. I was really eager to ask them about the class 
of 1947.1 wanted to hear what they knew about all those missing kids. 

Holding the cans of red paint, I made my way down the two flights of stairs 
to the basement. It all looked familiar now. 

I ran past the lunchroom to the double gym doors at the end of the hall. 
Pushed open the doors with my shoulder. And burst into the gym. 

“Hey—I’m back!” I called. “I—” 

The words caught in my throat. Thalia and Ben were sprawled facedown on 
the gym floor. 



6 


“Oh, nooooooo!” I let out a wail of horror. 

The paint cans fell from my hands and clattered heavily to the gym floor. 

One of the cans rolled in my path, and I stumbled over it as I hurtled toward 
my new friends. “Thalia! Ben!” I screamed. 

They both giggled. 

And raised their heads from the floor, grinning. 

Ben opened his mouth in a long, phony yawn. 

“We got so tired waiting for you, we fell asleep!” Thalia declared. 

They both laughed again. Ben shot Thalia a high five. 

They both climbed to their feet. Thalia hurried over to her purse. She pulled 
out a lipstick tube and began applying another red coat to her lips. 

Grinning, Ben narrowed his eyes at me. “You got lost—right?” 

I nodded unhappily. “Yeah. So? Big deal,” I muttered. 

“I win the bet!” Ben cried happily. He held out a hand to Thalia. “Pay up.” 

“Whoa! I don’t believe you two!” I exclaimed. “You bet on whether I got 
lost or not?” 

“We were pretty bored,” Thalia confessed. She handed Ben a dollar. 

He shoved it into his jeans pocket. Then he glanced up at the big scoreboard 
clock. “Oh, wow!” he cried. “I’m late! I promised my brother I’d get home by 
five.” 

He ran to the bleachers and started gathering up his backpack and jacket. 

“Hey, wait—” I called. “I want to tell you what I saw upstairs! I mean, it 
was so weird. I—” 

“Later,” he said, pulling on his jacket as he jogged toward the double doors. 

“But what about the red paint?” I cried. 

“I’ll drink it tomorrow!” he shouted. Then he disappeared out the doors. 

I watched them bang shut. Then I turned to Thalia. 

“He’s pretty funny sometimes,” she said. “I mean, sometimes he makes me 
laugh.” 

“Ha-ha,” I muttered. 

I picked up the cans of red paint and carried them over to our banners on 



the floor. “Sorry it took me so long,” I told her. “But—” 

She was brushing some kind of makeup onto her eyelids. “You saw 
something weird upstairs?” she asked, glancing at me over the little round mirror 
she held in her free hand. 

“Well, first I ran into the hall and knocked over this weird girl,” I told her. 
Thalia narrowed her eyes at me. “What weird girl?” 

“I don’t know her name,” I replied. “She’s big—a lot taller than me. And 
really tough looking. And she has the weirdest gray eyes, and—” 

“Greta?” Thalia asked. “You knocked over Greta?” 

“Is that her name?” I replied. 

“Dressed in black?” Thalia asked. “Greta always dresses in black.” 

“Yeah. That was her,” I said. “I knocked her flat. Then I fell on top of her. 
Smooth move, huh?” 

“Watch out for her, Tommy,” Thalia warned. “Greta is definitely weird.” 
She started to roll up her banner. “So what happened to you upstairs?” 

“I heard something,” I told her. “When I got to the art room. I heard voices. 
Kids’ voices. But when I went inside the room, there was no one there.” 

“Huh?” Thalia’s mouth dropped open. “You—you heard them?” she 
stammered. 

I nodded. 

“You really heard them?” 

“Yes. Who were they?” I demanded. “I kept searching for them. All over 
the third floor. I heard them, but I couldn’t see them. And then Mrs. Borden—” 

I stopped talking when I saw that Thalia had tears in her eyes. 

“Hey—what’s wrong?” I asked. 

She didn’t answer me. She spun away—and ran from the gym. 



7 


A few days later, Thalia had a run-in with Greta. And it almost turned violent. 

It was Thursday afternoon. Mr. Devine, our teacher, received a message 
from the office. He read the message a few times, moving his lips as he read. 
Then, muttering to himself, he left the room. 

It was near the end of the school day. I guess everyone was tired of sitting 
in school. We were all ready to break out of there. 

So as soon as Mr. Devine disappeared, everyone kind of exploded. I mean, 
guys jumped up and started running around the room. Doing funny dance moves 
and just goofing. 

One kid turned on a boom box he had hidden under his desk and cranked 
the music up. Some girls were laughing wildly about something in the back of 
the room, tossing their heads and slapping their hands on their desks. 

I sit in the back row since I’m a new kid. Ben was absent. I think he had a 
dentist appointment or something. 

So since I didn’t really know anyone else yet, I sort of was left out of all the 

fun. 

I tapped my hand to the music and pretended I was having a good time. But 
actually, I felt kind of awkward and lonely. And I secretly wished that Mr. 
Devine would come back so that things could return to normal. 

I stared out the window for a while. It was a cloudy autumn day. Very 
windy. The swirling wind gusts sent red and yellow leaves sailing and twisting 
over the playground. 

I stared at them for a while. Then I turned back into the room, and my eyes 
landed on Thalia in the front row. 

She wasn’t paying any attention to all the dancing and joking and wild 
laughter. She had her little mirror raised to her face and was slicking a layer of 
lipstick onto her lips. 

I waved and tried to get her attention. I wanted to know if she and I were 
going to work on decorations after school in the gym. 

I tried calling to her. But she couldn’t hear me over all the noise. She stared 
into her little mirror and didn’t turn around. 

I started to stand up and walk over to her—when I saw Greta lean over 



Thalia’s desk and grab the lipstick tube from her hand. Greta laughed and said 
something to Thalia. She held the lipstick tube out of Thalia’s reach. 

Thalia let out an angry scream. She swiped at the lipstick. But she wasn’t 
fast enough to grab it back. 

Greta’s gray eyes glinted with excitement. She laughed and heaved it to a 
guy across the room. 

“Give that back! ” Thalia shrieked. 

She leaped to her feet. Her eyes were wild, and her face was pale. 

“Give that back! Give it! Give it! ” 

With a furious growl, Thalia dove across the row of desks and tried to 
tackle the boy. 

Laughing, he dodged away from her and tossed the tube back to Greta. 

The metal tube hit a desk and bounced onto the floor. 

Thalia hurtled herself to the floor, grabbing at it wildly with both hands. 

I was halfway to the front of the room. As she and Greta wrestled on the 
floor for the lipstick, I gaped at Thalia in shock. 

What is the big deal? I wondered. Why is she so desperate to get that tube 
back? It’s only lipstick, after all. 

Other kids were watching the struggle. I saw the girls at the back of the 
room laughing at Thalia. They were the ones who had teased her about wearing 
makeup. 

Some kids cheered as Greta came up with the lipstick. She raised it in her 
big fist. 

Thalia screamed and grabbed at it. 

And then Greta raised the lipstick tube higher toward Thalia’s face. 

And drew a red smiley face on Thalia’s forehead. 

Thalia had tears in her eyes now. I saw that she was totally losing it. 

I didn’t really understand why she was so insane about it. But I decided I 
had to do something. 

Hero time for Tommy Frazer. 

“Hey—give that back to her!” I boomed. 

I took a deep breath and stepped forward to teach Greta a lesson.

Greta was holding the lipstick tube high over her head, pushing Thalia away 
with her other hand. 

“Give it back to her!” I insisted, trying to sound tough. “It isn’t funny, 
Greta. Give Thalia the lipstick.” 

I jumped up—and grabbed the hand with the lipstick in it. 

I heard some kids cheering and clapping. I didn’t know which of us they 
were cheering. 

Using both hands, I started to pry the tube from Greta’s big hand. 

And that’s when Mr. Devine returned to the room. 

“What’s going on?” he demanded. 

I turned to see him glaring at me through his round, black-frame eyeglasses. 

I lowered my hands from Greta’s fist. The lipstick tube dropped to the floor. 
It rolled under Thalia’s desk. 

With a tiny cry, she dove for it. 

“What’s happening in here?” Mr. Devine moved quickly to the front of the 
room. 

“Tommy, why are you up here?” the teacher demanded. Behind his thick 
glasses, his eyes looked as big as tennis balls! “Why did you leave your seat?” 

“I was just... uh... getting something,” I choked out. 

“He was helping me,” Thalia chimed in. I gazed down at her. She seemed a 
lot calmer now that she had her lipstick back. 

Meanwhile, my heart was pounding like crazy. 

“Get back to your seats, everyone,” Mr. Devine ordered. “I should be able 
to leave the room for two minutes without everyone going berserk.” He turned 
his stare on Greta. 

“Just goofing around,” she muttered. She tossed back her white-blond hair 
and dropped heavily into her seat. 

I slumped back to my desk and took deep breaths. I wanted to ask Thalia 
what the big deal was about her lipstick. But she didn’t turn around. 

It took a few more seconds for Mr. Devine to get everyone calmed down. 
Then he glanced up at the clock above the chalkboard. 

“We have twenty more minutes until the bell rings,” he announced. “I have 



to take care of some paperwork at my desk. So I’d like you to use the time for 
quiet reading.” 

He pulled off his glasses and blew a speck off one of the lenses. His eyes 
looked like tiny marbles when he took the glasses off. 

“Your book reports are all due on Monday,” he reminded us. “So this would 
be a good time to do some reading.” 

There was a lot of chair scraping and book bag thudding and thumping as 
we all pulled out our reading books. A few seconds later, the room fell silent. 

I was reading a book of short stories by Ray Bradbury for my book report. 
I’m not a science-fiction freak or anything. But these stories were really good. 
Most of them had surprise endings, which I really like. 

I tried to concentrate on the story I was reading. It was about these kids who 
live on a planet where it never stops raining. A very sad story. They never ever 
see the sun shine. And they can never go outside to play. 

I read a couple of pages. And then I nearly dropped the book when I heard a 
voice. A girl’s voice. Very soft—but very near. 

“Please help me, ” she cried. “Help me .... ” 

Startled, I slammed the book shut and glanced around. 

Who said that? 

My eyes landed on Thalia. Was she calling to me? 

No. She had her face buried in a book. 

“Help me — please!” I heard the girl plead again. 

I spun around. No one there. 

“Did anyone hear that?” I asked, more loudly than I’d planned. 

Mr. Devine raised his eyes from his papers. “Tommy? What did you say?” 

“Did anyone hear that girl?” I asked. “Calling for help?” 

A few kids laughed. Thalia turned and frowned at me. 

“I didn’t hear anything,” Mr. Devine replied. 

“No. Really,” I insisted. “I heard her. She said, ‘Please help me.’” 

Mr. Devine tsk-tsked. “You’re too young to start hearing voices.” 

Some more kids laughed. I didn’t think it was very funny. 

I sighed and picked up my book. I couldn’t wait for the bell to ring. I really 
wanted to get out of that classroom. 

I thumbed through the book, trying to find my page. 

But before I found it, I heard the girl’s voice again. 

So soft and near. And so unhappy. 



“Help me. Please. Please, somebody—help me.

On the night of the school dance, Ben, Thalia, and I got to the gym early. With 
only an hour to go, we were busily putting the finishing touches on the 
decorations. 

I thought it all looked pretty great. 

We had banners strung out in the hall outside the gym. And two big banners 
in the gym, proclaiming BELL VALLEY ROCKS! and WELCOME, 
EVERYONE! 

We tied huge bouquets of helium balloons to the two basketball hoops. The 
balloons were all red and black, of course. And we had red and black crepe- 
paper streamers on the walls and over the bleachers. 

Thalia and I had spent days painting a big poster of a bison giving the 
thumbs-up sign. Underneath the bison, it read BISONS RULE! in red and black 
letters. 

Thalia and I aren’t very good artists. The bison didn’t really look much like 
the photos of bisons we’d found in books. Ben said it looked more like a cow 
that had been sick for a long time. But we hung the poster up, anyway. 

Now, the three of us were arranging a red-and-black crepe-paper tablecloth 
over the refreshment table. I glanced up at the scoreboard clock. Seven thirty. 
The dance was scheduled to start at eight. 

“We still have a lot to do,” I said. 

Ben tugged his end of the paper tablecloth too hard. I heard a soft ripping 
sound. 

“Ooops,” he said. “Anybody bring any tape?” 

“It’s no problem,” Thalia told him. “We’ll just cover the torn part with soda 
bottles or something.” 

I glanced at the clock again. “When is the band supposed to arrive?” 

“Any minute,” Thalia replied. “They were supposed to get here early to set 

up.” 

Some kids had formed a band called Grunt. It was sort of a strange band— 
five guitar players and a drummer. And I heard some kids saying that three of the 
guitar players didn’t really know how to play. 

But Mrs. Borden asked them to perform a few songs at the dance. 



It took us a while to get the tablecloth straight. It wasn’t quite big enough 
for the table. 

“What’s next?” Ben asked. “Do we have decorations for the gym doors?” 

Before I could answer, the double doors swung open, and Mrs. Borden 
came charging in. At first, I didn’t recognize her. She wore a shiny bright red 
party dress. And she had her black curly hair piled up high on her head behind a 
silver tiara. 

Even with her hair piled up, she still wasn’t much taller than we were! 

Her eyes darted around the gym as she hurried over to us. “It looks great! 
Just fabulous, guys!” she gushed. “Oh, you worked so hard! You did a wonderful 
job!” 

We thanked her. 

She slapped a Polaroid camera into my hands. “Take pictures, Tommy,” she 
instructed me. “Snapshots of the decorations. Hurry. Take a whole bunch before 
people start arriving.” 

I examined the camera. “Well... okay,” I agreed. “But Thalia, Ben, and I 
still have some stuff to do. We have posters for the doors. And we need more 
balloons over there. And—and—” 

Mrs. Borden laughed. “You’re a little stressed!” 

Thalia and Ben laughed too. I could feel my face turning hot. I knew I was 
blushing. 

“Take it easy, Tommy,” Mrs. Borden said, patting my shoulder soothingly. 
“Or you won’t survive until the dance.” 

I forced a smile. “I’m okay,” I told her. 

Little did I realize that—after all my hard work—I would never see the 
dance.

“Yo! Look out!” 

“Move that amp! Hey, Greta—move that amp!” 

“Move it yourself!” 

“Where’s my wa-wa? Did anyone see my wa-wa pedal?” 

“I ate it for breakfast!” 

“You’re not funny. Move that amp!” 

The band members arrived while I was snapping Polaroids. And they 
instantly took over, making a big racket as they set up by the bleachers. 

The guitarists were all guys. Greta was the drummer. Seeing her lug her 
drums across the gym reminded me of the lipstick battle in class on Thursday. 

After school, I’d asked Thalia what the big deal was. “Why did you go 
nuts?” I asked. 

“I didn’t go nuts!” Thalia insisted. “Greta did. She thinks because she’s so 
big and strong she can just grab whatever she wants.” 

“She’s really weird,” I agreed. “But you were so upset—” 

“I like that lipstick. That’s all,” Thalia replied. “It’s my best lipstick. Why 
should I let her grab it from me?” 

Now Greta, dressed in black as always, was setting up with the rest of the 
band. They were all laughing and shoving each other around, tossing cables back 
and forth, tripping over their guitar cases. Acting like big shots because they had 
a band. 

A few other kids started to arrive. I recognized the two girls who were the 
ticket takers. And a couple of kids from the refreshment committee, who started 
complaining that somebody ordered only Mountain Dew and no Coke. 

I scrambled around, snapping photos of the banners and the balloons. I was 
setting up to shoot our bison poster—when a loud shout made me spin around. 

I saw Greta and one of the guitar players pretending to have a duel with 
guitars. The other band members were laughing and cheering them on. 

Greta had picked up one of the guitars. She and the other guy raised their 
guitars high over their heads and came charging at each other. 

“No—stop!” I screamed. 

Too late. 



Greta’s guitar ripped right through the BELL VALLEY ROCKS! banner. 
Tore it in two! 

I let out a loud groan as the two halves of the banner drooped to the floor. I 
turned and saw the unhappy faces of Thalia and Ben. 

“Hey—sorry about that!” Greta called. Then she burst out laughing. 

I hurried over to the wrecked banner and picked up one end. Thalia and Ben 
were right behind me. 

“What are we going to do?” I cried. “It’s ruined.” 

“We can’t just leave it here hanging over the floor,” Thalia said, shaking her 
head. 

“We need it!” I declared. 

“Yeah. It’s our best banner,” Thalia agreed. 

“Maybe we can tape it back together,” I suggested. 

“No problem. We’ll tape it together,” Ben said. “Come on, Tommy.” He 
grabbed my arm and started to pull me. 

I almost dropped Mrs. Borden’s Polaroid. “Where are we going?” I 
demanded. 

“Up to the art room, of course,” Ben replied. He started jogging to the 
double gym doors, and I followed. 

It won’t take long to tape it together, I thought. Then I’ll get a ladder from 
the janitor’s closet, and we’ll hang it back up. 

We stepped out into the hall—and I stopped. Kids were arriving for the 
dance, hurrying to the gym. 

“We don’t have time to fix the banner!” I told Ben. 

“We’ll hurry,” he said. “No problem.” 

“But—but the art room is way up on the third floor!” I sputtered. “By the 
time we get all the way back down to the gym...” 

“Relax,” Ben said. “It won’t take that long—if you’d stop complaining. 
Come on. Let’s go!” 

Ben was right. I started running down the hall. Kids were pouring into the 
gym. I knew we had to hurry. 

“Hey—not that way!” I heard him calling. “You’re going the wrong way, 
Tommy!” 

“I know where I’m going!” I called back. “I went this way last time!” 

I ran to the end of the hall and turned a corner. 

“Tommy—stop!” Ben called. 



“It’s up this way!” I called back to him. “This way is faster. I know it.” 

But I was wrong. I should have listened to Ben. A few seconds later, the 
hall ended at a boarded-up wall. 

“See?” Ben cried breathlessly. “What is your problem? The stairs are back 
there.” 

“Okay. I made a mistake,” I told him. “I wanted to hurry, that’s all.” 

“But you don’t know where you’re going!” he said angrily. “Remember, 
Tommy? You need a road map to find your toes!” 

“Very funny,” I muttered. I gazed around. “Where are we?” 

“I don’t know! I can’t believe I followed you!” Ben was annoyed. He 
banged both fists against the boarded-up wall. 

“Hey—!” 

We both cried out as the rotted, old boards broke away. Startled, Ben 
stumbled forward—and crashed right through the boards. 

They splintered and fell to the floor. And he fell on top of them. 

“Oh, wow.” I bent to help him up. “Check this out!” I said, peering down a 
dark hall. “This must be the old school building. The building they closed off.” 

“Thrills and chills,” Ben muttered. He groaned and rubbed his knee. “I 
scraped my knee on those boards. I think it’s bleeding.” 

I took a few steps into the dark hall. “This school has been closed off for 
fifty years,” I told him. “We’re probably the first kids in here since then!” 

“Remind me to write that in my diary,” Ben growled, still mbbing his knee. 
“Are we going to the art room or what?” 

I didn’t answer him. Something on the wall across from us caught my eye. I 
walked over to it. 

“Hey, Ben. Look. An elevator.” 

“Huh?” He hobbled across the hall to me. 

“Do you believe it?” I asked. “They had an elevator in the old school.” 

“Those kids were lucky,” Ben replied. 

I pressed the button on the wall. To my surprise, the doors slid open. “Whoa 
—!” I peered inside. A dusty ceiling lamp clicked on, sending pale white light 
down through the metal car. 

“It’s on!” Ben cried. “It’s working!” 

“Let’s take it to the third floor,” I urged. “Come on. Why should we walk 
up all those stairs?” 

“But—but—” Ben held back. But I grabbed his shoulders and pushed him 



inside the elevator. And followed him in. 

“This is great!” I exclaimed. “I told you I knew how to get there.” 

Ben’s eyes darted nervously around the narrow gray elevator car. “We 
shouldn’t be doing this,” he murmured. 

“What could happen?” I replied. 

The doors closed silently. 



11 


“Are we moving?” Ben asked. His eyes rose to the elevator ceiling. 

“Of course not,” I replied. “We haven’t pushed the button vet.” 

I reached out and pushed the button with a big black 3 on it. “What is your 
problem, anyway?” I demanded. “Why are you so nervous? We’re not robbing a 
bank or anything. We’re just riding an elevator because we’re in a hurry.” 

“The elevator is fifty years old,” Ben replied. 

“So?” I demanded. 

“So... we’re not moving,” Ben said softly. 

I pushed the button again. And listened for the hum that meant we were 
going up. 

Silence. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Ben said. “It’s not working. I told you we shouldn’t 
try it.” 

I pushed the button again. Nothing. 

I pushed the button marked 2. 

“We’re wasting time,” Ben said. “If we ran up the stairs, we’d be up there 
already. The dance is starting, and the stupid banner is trailing on the floor.” 

I pushed the 3 button again. And the 2 button. 

Nothing. No noise. We didn’t move. 

I pushed the button marked B. 

“We don’t want to go to the basement!” Ben cried. I heard a little panic start 
to creep into his voice. “Tommy, why did you push B?” 

“Just trying to get it to move,” I said. My throat suddenly felt a little dry. I 
had a knot in the pit of my stomach. 

Why weren’t we moving? 

I pushed all the buttons again. Then I pounded them with my fist. 

Ben pulled my hand away. “Nice try, ace,” he said sarcastically. “Let’s just 
get out of here, okay? I don’t want to miss the whole dance.” 

“Thalia is probably a little steamed by now,” I said, shaking my head. I 
pushed 3 a few more times. 

But we didn’t move. 



“Just open the doors,” Ben insisted. 

“Okay. Fine,” I agreed unhappily. My eyes swept over the control panel. 
“What’s wrong?” Ben asked impatiently. 

“I—I can’t find the door open button,” I stammered. 

He shoved me out of the way. “Here,” he said, gazing over the silvery 
buttons. “Uh...” 

We both studied the control panel. 

“There’s got to be a door open button,” Ben muttered. 

“Maybe it’s this one with the arrows,” I said. I lowered my hand to a button 
at the bottom of the metal panel. It had two arrows on it that pointed like this: 

<>. 

“Yes. Push it,” Ben said. He didn’t wait for me to do it. He reached past me 
and pushed the button hard with his open hand. 

I stared at the door, waiting for it to slide open. 

It didn’t move. 

I slapped the <> button again. And again. 

Nothing. 

“How are we going to get out of here?” Ben cried. 

“Don’t panic,” I told him. “We’ll get the doors open.” 

“Why shouldn’t I panic?” he demanded shrilly. 

“Because I want to be the one to panic first!” I declared. I thought my little 
joke would make him laugh and calm him down. After all, he was always 
making jokes. 

But he didn’t even smile. And he didn’t take his eyes off the dark elevator 
doors. 

I pushed the <> button one more time. I kept it pressed in with my thumb. 
The doors didn’t open. 

I pushed the 3 and the 2 buttons. I pushed the 1 button. 

Nothing. Silence. The buttons didn’t even click. 

Ben’s eyes bulged. He cupped his hands around his mouth. “Help us!” he 
screamed. “Can anybody hear me? Help us!” 

Silence. 

Then I spotted the red button at the top of the control panel. “Ben—look,” I 
said. I pointed to the red button. 

“An emergency button!” he exclaimed happily. “Go ahead, Tommy. Push it! 
It’s probably an alarm. Someone will hear it and come rescue us!” 



I pushed the red button. 

I didn’t hear an alarm. 

But the elevator started to hum. 

I heard the clank of gears. The floor vibrated beneath our feet. 

“Hey—we’re moving!” Ben cried happily. 

I let out a cheer. Then I raised my hand to slap him a high five. 

But the elevator jerked hard, and I fell against the wall. 

“Uh-oh,” I murmured, pulling myself up straight. I turned to Ben. We stared 
at each other in wide-eyed silence, not believing what was happening. 

The elevator wasn’t moving up. Or down. It was moving sideways. 



12 


The elevator rumbled and shook. I grabbed the wooden railing on the side. Gears 
clanked noisily. The floor vibrated beneath my shoes. 

We stared at each other, realizing what was happening. Neither of us spoke. 

Ben finally broke the silence. “This is impossible,” he murmured. His 
words came out in a choked whisper. 

“Where is it taking us?” I asked softly, gripping the rail so hard that my 
hands hurt. 

“It’s impossible!” Ben repeated. “It can’t be happening. Elevators only go 
up and—” 

The car jolted hard as we came to a very sudden stop. 

“Whoooa!” I let out a cry as my shoulder slammed into the elevator wall. 

“Next time, we’re taking the stairs,” Ben growled. 

The doors slid open. 

We peered out. Into total blackness. 

“Are we in the basement?” Ben asked, sticking his head out the door. 

“We didn’t go down,” I replied. A shiver ran down the back of my neck. 
“We didn’t go up or down. So...” 

“We’re still on the first floor.” Ben finished my sentence for me. “But why 
is it so dark here? I can’t believe this is happening!” 

We stepped out of the elevator. 

I waited for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. But they couldn’t adjust. It 
was too dark. 

“There must be a light switch,” I said. I ran my hand along the wall. I could 
feel the outline of tiles. But no light switch. 

I swept both hands up and down the wall. No. No light switch. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Ben urged. “We don’t want to get trapped here. We 
can’t see a thing.” 

I was still searching for the light. “Okay,” I agreed. I lowered my hand and 
started back to the elevator. 

I heard the doors slide shut. 

“No!” I let out a sharp cry. 



Ben and I banged on the elevator doors. Then I felt along the wall for the 
button to open the doors. 

Panicked, my hand trembled. I swept my open palm all along the wall on 
both sides of the closed doors. 

No button. No elevator button. 

I turned and leaned my back against the wall. I was suddenly breathing 
hard. My heart pounded. 

“I can’t believe this is happening,” Ben muttered. 

“Would you please stop saying that!” I demanded. “It is happening. We’re 
here. We don’t know where. But we’re here.” 

“But if we can’t call the elevator, how do we get out of here?” Ben whined. 

“We’ll find our way,” I told him. I took a deep breath and held it. I decided 
I had to be the calm one since he was being so whiny and scared. 

I listened hard. “I can’t hear any music or voices or anything. We must be 
far away from the gym.” 

“Well... what do we do?” Ben cried. “We can’t just stand here!” 

My mind whirred. I squinted into the darkness, hoping to make out the 
shape of a door or a window. Anything! 

But the blackness that surrounded us was darker than the sky on a starless 
night. 

I pressed my back against the cool tile wall. “I know,” I said. “We’ll keep 
against the wall.” 

“And?” Ben whispered. “And we’ll do what?” 

“We’ll move along the wall,” I continued. “We’ll move along the wall until 
we come to a door. A door to a room with a light. Then maybe we’ll be able to 
figure out where we are.” 

“Maybe,” Ben replied. He didn’t sound hopeful. 

“Stick close behind me,” I instructed him. 

He bumped up against me. 

“Not that close!” I said. 

“I couldn’t help it. I can’t see!” he cried. 

Moving slowly—very slowly—we started walking. I kept my right hand on 
the wall, sliding it along the tiles as we walked. 

We’d only taken a few steps when I heard a sound behind me. A cough. 

I stopped and turned around. “Ben—was that you?” 

“Huh?” He bumped into me again. 



“Did you cough?” I asked softly. 

“No,” he replied. 

I heard another cough. Then a loud whisper. 

“Uh... Ben...” I said, grabbing his shoulder. “Guess what? We’re not 
alone.” 



13 


We both gasped as the lights came on. Dim and gray at first. 

I blinked several times and waited for the light to brighten. 

But it didn’t. 

I stared out. We were in a room! A gray classroom. My eyes moved from 
the black chalkboard to the charcoal-colored teacher’s desk. To the dark gray 
student desks. The pale gray tile walls. Then down to the black-and-gray patterns 
on the classroom floor. 

“Weird,” Ben muttered. “My eyes—” 

“It’s not your eyes,” I assured him. “The light is so dim in this room, it 
makes everything look gray and black.” 

“It’s like being in an old black-and-white movie,” Ben declared. 

Squinting into the dim light, we started edging toward the classroom door. 
“Let’s get out of here,” I suggested. “Before the lights go out again.” 

We were halfway across the room when I heard another cough. And then a 
girl’s voice rang out. “Hey—!” 

Ben and I both stopped. We turned as a girl about our age stepped out from 
behind a book cabinet. 

She stared at us. 

We stared back at her. 

She was kind of cute, with short, straight black hair and bangs across her 
forehead. She wore an old-fashioned-looking V-necked sweater, a long, pleated 
skirt, and black-and-white saddle shoes. 

I opened my mouth to say hi. But no sound came out as I noticed her skin. 
Her skin was as gray as her sweater. And her eyes were gray. And her lips were 
gray. 

She was like the room. She was in black-and-white too! 

Ben and I exchanged confused glances. Then I turned back to the girl. She 
clung to the side of the cabinet, eyeing Ben and me suspiciously. 

“Were you hiding back there?” I blurted out. 

She nodded. “We heard you coming. But we didn’t know who you were.” 

“We?” I asked. 

Before she could answer, four more kids—two boys and two girls—jumped 



out from behind the tall cabinet. 

All gray! All in shades of gray! 

“Look at them!” one of the boys cried. His eyes bulged as he stared at us. 
“I don’t believe it!” another boy shouted. 

Before Ben and I could move, they rushed forward. 

All shouting and crying out at once, they stampeded across the room. 
Surrounded us. 

Grabbed us. 

Pulled at our clothes. 

Pulled us. Screaming. Laughing. Shrieking. 

Pulled out my shirt. Ripped my sleeve. 

“Ben—!” I screamed. “They—they’re going to tear us apartl” 



14 


“Look! Look at this!” a girl cried. She held up my shirtsleeve. 

Two boys tugged at the rest of my shirt. 

I dropped to the floor. Tried to squirm away. 

But they had us surrounded. 

A girl pulled off one of my shoes. 

Ben swung his fist hard, trying to fight them away. His hand smacked the 
blackboard, and he cried out in pain. 

“Stop!” I heard a boy shout over the cries of the others. “Stop it! Get away 
from them!” 

I kicked out with both feet. I saw Ben swing his fist again. 

“Stop it!” the boy screamed. “Get away! Come on—stop!” 

The kids backed away. The girl dropped my shoe. I grabbed it off the floor. 

They took several steps back, moving in a line, staring at us. 

“The color!” a girl exclaimed. “So much color!” 

“It hurts my eyes!” a boy cried. 

“But it’s so beautiful !” a girl gushed. “It—it’s like a dream!” 

“Do you still dream in color?” a boy asked her. “My dreams are all in black 
and white.” 

Tugging on my shoe, I climbed shakily to my feet. I struggled to straighten 
my khakis and tuck in my torn shirt. 

Ben rubbed the hand he had smacked. His blond hair was matted with 
sweat. His face was bright red. 

“Tommy,” he whispered. “What’s going on? This is crazyV 

I stared at the five kids lined up in front of us. 

“No color...” I murmured. 

All of them were in black and white. Their clothes, their skin, their eyes, 
their hair—no color at all. Only shades of gray and black. 

As I struggled to catch my breath, I studied them. And realized they didn’t 
look like modern kids, like kids from our school. 

The girls all wore skirts, long skirts down to their ankles. The boys wore 
big-collared sports shirts, tucked into baggy, pleated pants. 



Like in an old movie... I thought. 

And all black and gray. 

We all stared at one another for a long while. Then the boy who seemed to 
be their leader spoke up. “We’re all sorry,” he said. “You see, we—” 

“We didn’t mean to hurt you,” the girl beside him interrupted. “It’s just 
that... we haven’t seen color for so long.” 

“I just wanted to touch it,” the girl with black bangs across her forehead 
added, shaking her head sadly. “I wanted to touch color. It’s been so long. So 
long...” 

“Did you come to help us?” the first boy asked softly. His gray eyes locked 
on mine. Pleading eyes. 

“Help you?” I replied. “No. No, we didn’t. You see—” 

“That’s too bad,” the girl with black bangs said, frowning. 

“Huh? Too bad?” I didn’t understand. “Why?” I asked. 

“Because,” replied the girl, “now you can never leave.” 



15 


“Hey—we’ve already scared them. They think we’re a bunch of crazed savages. 
Don’t try to scare them even more, Mary!” the boy scolded. 

“I’m not!” she insisted, crossing her arms over the front of her gray sweater. 
“I just think they should know the truth. I think—” 

“The truth?” I interrupted. “What’s going on here? This is a joke—right?” 

“Yeah. Go ahead. Wipe off the gray powder from your face and tell us it’s a 
joke,” Ben chimed in. 

The girl named Mary bit her bottom lip. I saw a tear form in her left eye. It 
brimmed over and ran down her gray cheek. “It’s no joke,” she choked out. 

“Give us a break!” Ben groaned. “Just make the lights brighter, and—” 

“That won’t help!” the boy cried angrily. 

Mary turned to him. She wiped the tear from her cheek. “I really thought 
they came to help us,” she said in a quivering voice. “I really thought that 
finally...” Her voice trailed off. 

Another girl put her arm around Mary. 

I shut my eyes for a moment. Squinting into the gray was giving me a 
headache. 

“Will someone tell us what is going on?” I heard Ben demand. 

I opened my eyes to see all five gray kids moving across the room toward 
us. 

The leader was a little taller than me. He had wavy black hair, and big black 
eyes that crinkled at the sides. I saw a small gray scar above one eyebrow. He 
had broad shoulders beneath his gray T-shirt. He was very athletic looking. 

The girl beside him was tall and very thin. She had long gray hair that fell 
straight down her back. She had sad gray eyes. 

“I’m Seth,” the boy said. “This is Mary and this is Eloise.” He pointed. 
“Eddie and Mona.” 

Ben and I introduced ourselves. 

“We didn’t mean to frighten you,” Mary repeated. “But can we touch your 
colors? We haven’t seen color for so long. We just—” Her voice cracked. She 
turned away. 

“Uh... Ben and I have to get back to the dance,” I told them, eyeing the 



door. “You see, we’re on the Decorations Committee. And a banner tore. And—” 

“You can’t get back,” Seth said. His dark eyes narrowed on mine. “Mary 
told you the truth. You can’t get back.” 

“That’s stupid,” Ben replied, shaking his head. “We’re in the old building— 
right? We’ll follow the hall till it leads to the new building. The gym is right 
downstairs.” 

Eloise coughed. I realized she was the one I’d heard when the lights were 
still out. She wiped her nose with a gray tissue. She appeared to have a cold. 

“You’re not in the old building,” she said hoarsely. 

“Then where are we?” Ben demanded. “The basement?” 

The gray kids shook their heads. 

“It’s a little hard to explain,” Seth said. 

“Well, we’ll find our way back,” I told them, starting for the door. “I mean, 
the school isn’t that big. We won’t be lost for long.” 

“You’re not really in the school,” Eloise said, wiping her nose again. 

“Excuse me?” Ben cried. “This looks a lot like a classroom to me. See? 
Desks? Chairs? Chalkboard?” 

“Let’s go,” I said. I gave him a little push toward the door. 

“Sit down,” Seth ordered sharply. 

Ben and I were nearly to the classroom door. 

“I said sit down,” Seth repeated. 

“You’d better listen to him,” the girl named Mona warned. 

Seth motioned impatiently to two desks. “Sit.” 

I swallowed hard. I felt a chill of fear over my entire body. I didn’t 
understand what was going on here. And I didn’t really want to understand. 

I just wanted to get away from this gray room and these black-and-white 

kids. 

They moved across the room toward us. Their expressions were tense. Seth 
held his arms stiffly at his sides, as if ready for a fight. 

“Sit down, guys,” he insisted. 

“Sorry. Some other time,” Ben replied. 

He and I both had the same idea in our heads. 

We both turned and ran at the same time. We made a mad dash for the 
classroom door. 

I got there first. 

I grabbed the door handle. Turned it. And pulled. 



“Come on! Come on!” Ben cried frantically. 
“It—it won’t open!” I shrieked. 

The door was locked. 



16 


In a total panic, Ben grabbed the doorknob and bumped me out of the way. He 
tugged with both hands. Then he lowered his shoulder to the door and tried 
pushing it open. 

But the door didn’t budge. 

“That door won’t open,” Seth said calmly. 

I turned. Seth still held his arms tensely at his sides. The other four gray 
kids stood on either side of him, their eyes narrowed at us, squinting at us 
through the dim gray light. 

“Why—why is it locked?” I stammered breathlessly. 

“It isn’t a door we can use,” Mary replied. Another tear glistened on her 
pale gray cheek. “It leads to the world of color.” 

“Huh? Excuse me?” I cried. 

“Whose idea is this little joke?” Ben demanded impatiently. “It’s not funny, 
guys! Not funny!” 

I could see that Ben was about to lose it. I put a hand on his arm, a signal to 
calm down. 

I had a feeling that these kids weren’t joking. 

“How do we get out of here?” Ben demanded. He banged a fist against the 
door. “You can’t keep us in this weird gray room. No way!” 

Seth motioned to the desks again. “Sit down, guys,” he pleaded again. 
“We’re not trying to keep you here. And we don’t plan to hurt you or anything.” 

Ben glanced at his watch. “But—but—” 

“We’ll try to explain,” Mary offered. “You really should try to understand 
what has happened.” 

“Especially since you will be staying here with us,” Eloise added. 

Another cold shiver ran down my back. “Why do you keep saying that?” I 
asked. 

They didn’t reply. 

Ben and I dropped into desk chairs. The three girls took chairs across from 
us. Eddie crossed his gray arms and leaned against the blackboard. 

Seth pulled himself up onto the teacher’s desk. “It’s hard to know where to 
start,” he said, running a hand back through his thick black hair. 



“Start by telling us where we are,” I demanded. 

“And then tell us how to get to the gym,” Ben insisted. “Make it short— 
okay?” 

“You’ve come to the other side,” Seth said. 

Ben rolled his eyes. “The other side of what?” he asked impatiently. 

“The other side of the wall,” Seth replied. 

Eloise sneezed. She pulled a wad of tissues from the bag at her side. “I can’t 
get rid of this cold,” she sighed. “I think it’s because there’s no sunlight.” 

“No sunlight?” I cried. “The other side of the wall?” I let out a loud groan. 
“Will you all please stop talking in mysteries?” 

Mona turned to Seth. “Start at the beginning,” she said. “Maybe that will 
help them.” 

Eloise fumbled around in her gray bag. Finally, she pulled out a pack of 
tissues and placed them on the desk in front of her. 

“Well, okay,” Seth agreed. “The beginning.” 

Ben and I exchanged glances. Then we leaned forward to listen. 

“The five of us were in the very first class at Bell Valley School,” Seth 
began. “The school opened about fifty years ago, and—” 

“Whoa! Wait a minute!” Ben jumped to his feet. “Tommy and I aren’t 
morons!” he declared. “If you went to school fifty years ago, you’d be at least 
sixty years old!” 

Seth nodded. “Guess you’re good at math, huh?” It was a joke, but it 
sounded bitter. 

“We haven’t aged,” Mary explained, straightening her black bangs with one 
hand. “We’ve stayed exactly the same age for fifty years!” 

Ben rolled his eyes. “I think that elevator took us to Mars!” he whispered to 
me. 

“It’s all true,” Eddie said, shifting his weight. “We’re frozen here. Frozen in 
time.” 

“The elevator must move between your world and ours,” Mona said, gazing 
back at it. “No one else has ever come here by elevator. It’s not how we arrived.” 

“I don’t understand,” I confessed. “None of this makes sense to me. The 
elevator was boarded up. Hidden. Why did it bring us here?” 

“It must be the only connection between our worlds,” Mona said 
mysteriously. 

❖ “This is all crazy. We’re missing the dance,” Ben whispered. 



“Let them finish the story,” I told him. “Then weTl go.” 

Seth stood up and began pacing back and forth. “The first class at Bell 
Valley School was pretty small,” he told us. “There were only twenty-five of us. 
It was a brand-new school, and we were kind of happy to be the first ones in it.” 

Eloise sneezed. Mona said, “Bless you.” 

“One day, our principal announced it was Class Photo Day,” Seth 
continued. “A photographer came to take a group photo of our class.” 

“Was it a color photo?” Ben broke in. He laughed. But no one else did. 

“School photos weren’t in color in the nineteen forties,” Mary told Ben. 
“They were in black and white.” 

“We all gathered in the library to take the photo,” Seth continued. “All 
twenty-five of us. The photographer lined us up.” 

“I recognized him right away,” Eddie broke in. “He was an angry man. An 
evil man. He hated kids.” 

“We were all in a crazy mood,” Mona added. “We were laughing and joking 
around a lot and pretending to wrestle. And the photographer became furious 
because we wouldn’t stand still for him.” 

“We all hated him,” Eddie chimed in. “The whole town knew he was evil. 
But he was the only photographer around.” 

“I’ll never forget his name,” Eloise said sadly. “Mr. Chameleon. I’ll never 
forget it. Because... because a chameleon changes colors—and we can’t.” 

“Mr. Chameleon?” Ben snickered. “Didn’t he used to hang out with Mr. 
Lizard?” 

“Ben, stop—” I pleaded. 

I could see that Ben didn’t believe a word of Seth’s story. He kept making 
jokes. But Seth and the others looked so solemn, so bitter. 

Staring at their old-fashioned clothes and haircuts, at their sad, gray faces, I 
believed them. They were the vanished kids, I realized. The lost class of 1947. 

“The photographer lined us up in three rows,” Seth continued, pacing back 
and forth, hands shoved in his gray pants pockets. “He stood behind his big box 
camera. It had a drape on the back that he stuck his head under. Then he raised 
the flash high. 

“He told us to say ‘cheese’. Then the flash went off with a loud CRACK!” 

“But it wasn’t a normal flash,” Mary broke in. “It was so bright... so 
bright...” Her voice trailed off. 

“So bright, we couldn’t see,” Seth continued, shaking his head. “The room 



—the library—it disappeared in the flash. And when we could open our eyes, 
when we could see again... we were here.” 

Ben opened his mouth. Probably to make another lame joke. But I guess he 
changed his mind. He closed his mouth without saying anything. 

“We were here,” Seth repeated, his voice shaking with emotion. He 
slammed the desk with his fist. “We weren’t in the library anymore. We weren’t 
in the real school anymore. We were here. Here in this black-and-white world.” 

“As if we were trapped inside a photograph,” Mona broke in. “Trapped 
forever inside a black-and-white photograph.” 

“Trapped in Grayworld,” Eddie said bitterly. “That’s what we call it. 
Grayworld.” 

“We’ve tried everything,” Eloise added. “We’ve tried every way to get 
back. We still call out for help. We still think maybe someone will come....” 

“I heard you,” I murmured. “I was in class. And I heard you calling.” 

“But—but—” Ben sputtered. “I don’t get it. Where exactly are we?” 

No one answered for a long moment. Then Seth walked up to Ben. Pressing 
his hands on the desktop, he lowered his face close to Ben’s, staring Ben in the 
eyes. 

“Ben,” he said, “did you ever see a wall and wonder what was on the other 
side?” 

Ben glanced uncomfortably at me. “Yeah. I guess,” he replied. 

“Well, we’re on the other side!” Seth cried. “We’re on the other side of your 
world. And now, you are too.” 

“Soon you will be one of us!” Eddie said. 

“No—!” Ben cried. 

He said more, but I didn’t hear him. 

I glanced down at my hands—and opened my mouth in a high scream of 
horror. 



17 


“My—my fingers !” I shrieked. 

I held both hands up to show them. My fingers had turned gray. The gray 
was spreading onto my palms. 

Ben grabbed my hand and pulled it close to examine it. “Oh no,” he 
murmured. “No...” 

“Ben—yours too!” I cried. 

He dropped my hand and studied his hands. His right hand was almost 
entirely gray. The fingers on his left hand were gray, and the color in his palm 
was starting to fade. 

“No... no...” he repeated, shaking his head. 

I raised my eyes to the five gray kids. “You—you weren’t joking,” I choked 
out. 

They stared back at us with blank expressions. 

Mary stared at my hands. “It moves quickly,” she said finally. “You’ll see.” 

“No!” I cried, jumping to my feet. “What can we do? We can’t turn gray! 
We can’tl” 

“You have no choice,” Eloise said sadly. “You are in Grayworld now. All 
color fades so quickly here.” 

“You are one of us now,” Seth repeated. “Once you turn completely gray, 
you will never be able to turn back.” 

“No!” Ben and I both protested. 

“We’re getting out!” I cried. I kicked my chair aside and ran back to the 
classroom door. I turned the knob and struggled to pull it open. 

Ben stepped up beside me, and we both pulled until we were groaning and 
our faces were bright red. 

“It’s bolted shut from the other side,” Seth called. “You’re wasting your 
time.” 

“No—” I insisted. “We’re getting out. We’re getting out now!” 

With a desperate cry, I raised both fists and started pounding on the wall. 
“Help us!” I screamed. “Somebody—help us! Can you hear me? Please—help!” 

I pounded until my fists hurt. Then I lowered my hands with a sigh. 

“Don’t you think we already tried that?” Mary asked bitterly. “We pound on 



the walls and call for help all the time.” 

“But no one ever answers,” Eloise added. “And no one ever comes to help.” 

I gazed down at my hands. They were completely gray to the wrists. I 
pulled up my sleeves. The color of my arms was starting to fade. 

“Ben—!” I started. He was staring at his graying skin too. 

My mind whirred. I suddenly felt dizzy. 

“How do we escape from here? How do we get back to our world?” 

“Maybe the elevator?” Ben suggested. 

“It’s no use,” Seth warned. 

But we ignored him and bolted through the aisle between the desks. To the 
alcove in back of the big gray classroom. The narrow alcove that held the 
elevator. 

“There’s no elevator button,” Mary called after us. “No way to call the 
elevator.” 

“It never runs,” Seth added. “It hasn’t run in fifty years. When we heard it 
moving tonight, we couldn’t believe it.” 

“There’s got to be a way!” I cried. 

I smoothed my hand over the wall beside the elevator doors. “There’s got to 
be a hidden button.” The wall felt warm and smooth. 

I pounded it with my fist until my whole hand ached. 

Ben pressed his hands along the crack between the two doors. With a groan, 
he struggled to pry the elevator doors open. 

No luck. 

“A screwdriver?” he called over his shoulder. “Does anyone have a 
screwdriver?” 

“Or maybe a knife, or a stick, or something?” I added. “To pry the doors 
apart?” 

“We tried it,” Eloise moaned in her hoarse, scratchy voice. “We tried 
everything. Everything !” 

I kicked the metal doors hard. I felt so fmstrated, and angry, and frightened 
—all at the same time. 

Pain shot up my foot and leg. I hobbled back against the wall, breathing 

hard. 

My shirtsleeves were graying. I pulled up one sleeve. The gray on my skin 
had moved past my wrist. 

“Sit down with us,” Mary called. “Sit down and wait. It really isn’t that 



bad.” 

“You get used to it,” Seth added softly. 

“Used to it?” I cried shrilly, still breathing hard. “Used to a world without 
any color? Used to being totally in black and white? And not being able to go 
home? Or go anywhere?” 

Mary lowered her head. The others gazed back at Ben and me, their gray 
faces solemn and sad. 

“I—I’m not going to get used to it!” I stammered. “Ben and I are getting 
out of here.” 

I raised one hand and rubbed it with the other. I guess I thought maybe I 
could rub the gray off. My skin felt warm and soft as ever. It didn’t feel any 
different. 

But the color was gone. And the gray was creeping up, creeping up fast. 

“What are we going to do?” Ben cried. His eyes were wild. His voice came 
out high and shrill. 

“The window!” I shouted, pointing. “Come on. Out the window!” 

“No!” Seth shouted. He moved quickly to block our path. “No—don’t! I’m 
warning you—” 

“Don’t go out there!” Eddie cried. 

Why are they trying to stop us? I wondered. They don’t want us to escape! 
They want to keep us here! They want us to be as gray as they are! 

“Out of the way, Seth!” I cried. 

Ben dodged one way. I dodged the other. 

Seth made a grab for me. But I slid away from him. 

And dove to the window ledge. 

Staring out into the gray night, I shoved up the window. 

“Stay away from the kids!” 

“They’re crazy! They’ve all gone crazy!” 

“They’ll take you to the pit!” 

We heard their cries and warnings behind us. But they didn’t make any 
sense to us. So we ignored them. 

Ben and I climbed onto the window ledge—and scrambled out. 



18 


Ben dropped onto the ground with a hard THUD. I followed him, landing on my 
feet on soft grass. 

The night sky spread overhead, a solid black. No stars. No moon. 

Seth and the others appeared at the window, shouting and signaling for us to 
come back. But we both took off, jogging over the dark grass. 

We crossed the street and saw low, dark houses set far back on gray lawns. 
No lights shone in the windows. No cars came by. No one was out walking. 

“Is this Bell Valley?” Ben asked as we crossed another street and kept 
jogging. “Why doesn’t it look familiar?” 

“These aren’t the same houses across from the school,” I said. 

A chill of fear made me stop running. 

How could there be a whole different town out here? And where were the 
people who lived here? 

Was it deserted? Was it like a movie set? I suddenly wondered. Not a real 
neighborhood at all? 

The kids’ warnings repeated in my ears. Maybe Ben and I made a mistake, I 
thought. Maybe we should have listened to them. 

I turned back toward the school. Wisps of fog came floating up from the 
ground. The school rose darkly behind the spreading gray mist. 

Startled, I squinted hard at it. “Whoa—Ben,” I gasped. “Check out the 
school.” 

He was studying it too. “That’s not our school!” he exclaimed. 

We were staring at a low, square building with a flat roof. Only one story 
high. Gray light flooded from the only window facing the street. 

The light fell on a slender, bare flagpole planted near the street. And a small 
set of swings, silvery gray in the dim wash of light. 

“We’re in a different world,” I said, my voice shaky and shrill. “We’re in a 
different world—so close to ours.” 

“But—but—” Ben sputtered. 

The clumps of fog began to float together, forming a billowing wall. It 
moved quickly up from the ground, hiding the bottom of the building from us 


now. 



“Let’s keep going,” I urged Ben. “There’s got to be a way out of here!” 

We started to jog again, moving past darkened houses and empty lots. 
Running under black-trunked trees, all winter bare. Our shoes clattering over 
streets without cars or streetlights. 

I kept gazing up at the sky, hoping to see the moon or the blinking light of a 
star. But I stared up at a ceiling of solid black. 

We’re like shadows, I thought. Shadows running through shadows. 

Stop it, Tommy! I scolded myself. Don’t start thinking weird thoughts. Just 
keep your mind straight ahead on what you have to do. 

Which is to find a way to escape from this place. 

We jogged past a black mailbox, across another empty street. And as we 
ran, the fog swept around us. 

It floated low at first, clinging to the dark grass, billowing over the streets. 
There was no breeze. No wind at all. 

But the fog quickly began to rise. It rose all around us. Hiding the houses 
behind it. Hiding the bare trees and streets and driveways—hiding everything 
behind a thick, swirling curtain of gray. 

With a groan, Ben stopped jogging. 

I ran right into him. “Hey—!” I cried out breathlessly. “Why did you stop?” 

“I can’t see anything,” he choked out. “The fog...” He lowered his hands to 
his knees and leaned forward, struggling to catch his breath. 

“We’re not getting anywhere—are we?” I asked softly. “I mean, we could 
probably keep running forever. And we’d never get out of this place.” 

“Maybe we should wait till morning,” Ben suggested, still bent over. “Then 
the fog will probably be gone and we can see where we’re going.” 

“Maybe...” I said doubtfully. 

I shivered. I wondered how much of me had turned gray. Did I have any 
color left? 

I pulled up my shirt and struggled to see. But it was too dark. Everything 
looked black and gray. I couldn’t tell. 

“What do you want to do?” I asked Ben. “Go back to the school?” 

The fog swept around us. So thick, I could barely see him. 

“I—I don’t think we could find the school in this fog,” he stammered. I 
could hear the fear in his voice. 

I turned back. 

He was right. I couldn’t see the street or the trees on the other side of the 



thick mist. 

“Maybe we can retrace our steps,” I suggested. “If we keep going in that 
direction—” I pointed. 

But in the thick, spinning fog, I wasn’t sure it was the right direction. 

“This was dumb,” Ben muttered. “We should have listened to those kids. 
They were trying to help us, and—” 

“It’s too late to think about that,” I said sharply. “I have an idea. Let’s try to 
find our way through the fog to one of the houses and spend the night there.” 

“You mean break in?” Ben demanded. 

“They seem to be empty,” I replied. The fog swirled thicker, wrapping us up 
tightly. I tugged his arm. “Come on. We’ll find a place to wait until morning. It’s 
better than standing out here all night.” 

“I guess...” he agreed. 

We turned and began walking up a sloping front yard. We had to move 
slowly because we could barely see. 

We took six or seven steps—and then I let out a scream as someone 
knocked me to the ground. 



19 


“Ohhhhhh!” A terrified moan escaped my throat. 

I rolled onto my back. 

A black cat tumbled beside me. 

A cat? 

It had jumped onto my shoulders from a tree limb. 

The cat stared up at me with gray eyes. Its black fur bristled. Its tail stood 
straight up. 

And then it took off, vanishing into the fog. 

I pulled myself shakily to my feet. 

“Tommy, what happened?” Ben demanded. 

“Didn’t you see that cat?” I cried. “It jumped down on me. Knocked me to 
the ground. I thought... I thought...” The words caught in my throat. 

“Are you okay? I couldn’t see it,” Ben replied. “The fog—it’s so thick. All 
of a sudden, you screamed. You scared me to death!” 

I rubbed the back of my neck. Why did the cat jump on me like that? I 
wondered. 

Maybe it’s lonely, I decided. With no other people around. 

And just as I thought that, I heard a girl’s voice. “Over here!” she called. 

And then a boy, very nearby, shouted: “Don’t let them get away! Grab 
them!” 



20 


Ben and I squinted into the fog. We heard shrill voices. And then the thump of 
footsteps over the grass. But we couldn’t see anyone. 

We didn’t know which way to run. 

“This way! Over here!” the girl repeated breathlessly to her friend. 

“Stop them!” another girl chimed in. 

Ben and I spun around. “Who’s there?” I tried to shout. But my voice 
spilled out weak and frightened. “Who is it?” 

And then, figures appeared in the swirling fog. Shadowy, gray figures. 
Running toward us and then stopping just near enough to see through the curtain 
of gray. 

Staring, surprised faces. 

Their arms out. Bodies tense. Hair blowing in the circling mist. 

I backed up to Ben. We stood back to back, gaping out at them as they 
formed a tight circle around us. 

“They’re—kids!” Ben exclaimed. “More kids!” 

Are they the rest of the missing class? I wondered. 

“Hey—!” I called to them. “What are you doing out here?” 

They stared back at us in silence. 

The fog billowed and shifted. I saw a short, black-haired girl whispering to 
a big kid in an old-fashioned-looking black jacket. And then the fog covered 
them again, and they seemed to vanish before my eyes. 

Other kids appeared and disappeared. There must have been about twenty 
of them. 

They spoke softly to one another, gazing out at us, keeping in a tight circle. 

“What are you doing out here?” I repeated, trying not to sound as frightened 
as I felt. “My friend and I—we’re lost. Can you help us?” 

“You still have color,” a girl murmured. 

“Color. Color. Color.” The word was repeated among the circle of gray 

kids. 

“They must be the other kids from the class,” Ben whispered. “The kids 
Seth and the others warned us about.” 



Seth’s warning flashed back into my mind: “They’re crazy. They’ve all 
gone crazy. ” 

“We’re lost!” I cried. “Can you help us?” 

They didn’t reply. They whispered excitedly among themselves. 

“Turn, turn, ” a boy called suddenly. So loud, I jumped back. 

“What did you say?” I demanded. “Can you help us?” 

“Turn, turn,” a girl repeated. 

“We don’t belong here!” Ben cried. “We’re trying to get away from here. 
But we’re totally lost.” 

“Turn, turn,” a few voices murmured. 

“Please—answer us!” I begged. “Can you help us?” 

And then they all chanted, “Turn, turn. ” And they began to dance. 

Keeping the circle tight, they moved to the right in a rapid rhythm. They 
raised one leg high, and stepped to the right. Lowered the leg and gave a little 
kick. Then another high step to the right. 

Some kind of weird dance. 

“Turn, turn,” they chanted. “Turn, turn.” 

“Please—stop!” Ben and I both pleaded. “Why are you doing that? Are you 
trying to scare us?” 

“Turn, turn. ” The dark, dancing figures moved in and out of the swirling 

fog. 

The fog lifted for a moment, and I saw that they were holding hands as they 
danced. Holding hands tightly. Keeping the circle closed. 

Keeping Ben and me inside. 

“Turn, turn,” they chanted. A step, then a kick. “Turn, turn. ” 

“What are they doing?” Ben whispered to me. “Is it a game or something?” 

I swallowed hard. “I don’t think so,” I replied. 

The fog shifted again. It lowered over the grass, then billowed away. 

I squinted at the chanting faces as they moved in the circle. 

Their expressions were hard. 

Their eyes cold. 

Cold, unfriendly faces. 

“Turn, turn. Turn, turn. ” 

“Stop it!” I screamed. “Give us a break! What are you doing? Please— 
somebody explain!” 

“Turn, turn. ” The chant continued. The circle of kids moved to the right. 



They stared at Ben and me, as if challenging us—as if daring us to stop them. 

“Turn, turn. 

Turn to gray. 

Turn, turn. 

Turn to gray! ” 

The circle spun around us. The kids danced in rhythm in the billowing fog. 
A steady, frightening rhythm. 

So cold... so menacing. 

So crazy ! 

“Turn, turn. 

Turn to gray. 

Turn, turn. 

Turn to gray. ” 

And suddenly, watching the eerie dance, listening to their machinelike 
chant, I knew. I knew what they were doing. It was some kind of weird 
ceremony. They were watching us, holding us there. Holding us there until we 
were gray like them. 



21 


“Turn, turn. 

Turn to gray. ” 

As the kids moved in their tight circle, chanting softly, I studied their faces. 
So hard... so cold. 

They were trying to frighten us. 

I counted nine girls and ten boys. All dressed in old-fashioned clothes. Big, 
heavy shoes. And I suddenly wished this was all an old movie. All just a movie 
and not really happening to Ben and me. 

“Turn, turn. 

Turn to gray. ” 

“Why are you doing this?” Ben shouted over their eerie chant. “Why won’t 
you talk to us?” 

They continued their circle dance, ignoring his cries. 

I turned to him, leaning close so that he could hear me. “We have to make a 
mn for it,” I said. “They’re crazy. They’re going to keep us here. Until we are 
totally gray like them.” 

Ben nodded solemnly, his eyes on the circle of kids. 

He cupped his hands around his mouth to reply to me. And I gasped. His 
hands were completely gray. 

I raised both of my hands to my face. Gray. Solid gray. 

How far had the gray traveled? How much time did Ben and I have? 

“We’ve got to get away from them,” I told him. “Come on, Ben. On the 
count of three. You run this way. And I’ll run that way.” I motioned in two 
different directions. 

“If we take them by surprise, maybe we can break through,” I said. 

“And then what?” Ben replied. 

I didn’t want to answer that question. I didn’t know the answer. “Let’s just 
get away from them!” I cried. “I can’t stand that stupid chanting for one more 
second!” 

Ben nodded. He sucked in a deep breath. 

“One...” I counted. 



“Turn, turn. 

Turn to gray. ” 

The chanting kids had tightened their circle. They were nearly arm in arm. 
Had they read our minds? 

“Two...” I counted. I tensed my leg muscles. Prepared to run. 

The curtain of fog had lifted. Puffs of mist clung to the ground. But I could 
see dark houses beyond the circle of kids. 

If we can break through their linked arms, maybe we can hide in one of 
those houses, I thought. 

“Good luck,” Ben murmured. 

“Three!” I shouted. 

We lowered our heads and started to run. 



22 


I went about four steps and slipped on the wet grass. 

“OW!” I cried out as pain shot up my right leg. Did I pull a muscle? 

The chanting stopped. The gray kids let out shouts of surprise. 

My leg throbbed with pain. I had to stop. I bent to rub the leg muscle. 
Raising my gaze, I saw Ben dart toward the circle. “Aaaiiiii!” He let out a 
wild scream as he ran. 

Two boys tackled him: one high, one low. Ben dropped to the grass, and 
they fell on top of him. 

“Get off! Get off me!” Ben shrieked. 

A boy and girl grabbed me roughly. They spun me around. And shoved me 
hard toward Ben. 

“Let us go!” I cried. “What are you doing? Why are you keeping us here?” 
They pulled Ben to his feet. And shoved us together. 

They grouped around us quickly, bodies tensed, ready to capture us if we 
tried another escape. 

“We’re not going anywhere,” I sighed. “Will somebody please explain what 
is going on here.” 

“Turn, turn, ” a girl with long gray braids said in a husky voice. 

“I’ve heard that!” I cried angrily. 

“Turn to gray,” the girl added. “We’re waiting for you to turn.” 

“Why?” I demanded. “Just tell us why.” 

“No color in the moon,” she replied. “No color in the stars.” 

“No color in my dreams,” a boy added sadly. 

“Please—make sense!” Ben pleaded. “I—I don’t understand!” 

I rubbed my sore leg. The pain had faded, but the muscle still ached. 

“Just help us get back to the school,” I pleaded. 

“We left the school!” a boy shouted. “No color in the school.” 

“No color anywhere,” a girl cried. “We’ll never go back to school.” 

“No school! No school! No school!” some kids chanted. 

“But we have to get back there!” I insisted. 

“No school! No school! No school!” they chanted again. 




“It’s no use,” Ben whispered in my ear. “They’re totally messed up! They 
don’t make any sense at all.” 

I felt a chill. The air was turning colder. 

A wave of terror swept over me. I struggled to fight it back. 

Kids grabbed Ben and me. They pushed us roughly across the grass. They 
held us tightly by the shoulders and forced us forward. 

“Where are you taking us?” I screamed. 

They didn’t answer. 

Ben and I struggled to break free. But there were too many of them. And 
they were too strong. 

They pushed us up a dark hill. Wisps of fog swirled around our feet as we 
climbed. The tall grass was wet and slippery. 

“Where are we going?” I cried. “Tell us! Where are you taking us?” 

“The Black Pit!” a girl exclaimed. She pressed her mouth close to my ear as 
we walked. “Will you jump, or will we have to push you?” 



23 


“Pit? What kind of pit?” I screamed. 

No one answered. 

We stopped at the top of the hill. They kept their tight grip on Ben and me. 
Over Ben’s shoulder, I saw four kids approaching. As they came nearer, I saw 
that they were carrying four large buckets. 

They set the buckets down in a row. They shoved Ben and me toward them. 
Steam poured up from a dark, bubbling liquid inside. A sharp, sour aroma 
rose up in the steam. 

A girl carried a stack of metal cups in her arms. She handed a cup to a boy. 
He dipped it into the thick black liquid. It made a hissing sound as the cup 
dipped low into the liquid. 

“Ohhh!” I gasped as the boy raised the steaming cup to his lips, tilted his 
head back, and poured the disgusting liquid down his throat. 

“No color in the cup!” a boy shouted. 

“Drink the blackness!” a girl cried. 

“Drink! Drink! Drink!” Kids cheered and applauded. 

They lined up eagerly. And as Ben and I stared in horror, they each dipped a 
cup into the smelly black gunk—and then drank it down. 

“No color in the drink! No color in the cup!” 

“Drink! Drink the blackness!” 

I tried once again to break free. But three boys held me now. I couldn’t 
move. 

Kids were cheering and laughing. A boy drank a whole cup of the smelly 
black liquid—and then spewed it into the air. 

Loud cheers. 

A girl spit loudly and sprayed black gunk into the face of the girl beside her. 
A boy sprayed the black liquid up like a fountain. 

“We cover ourselves in blackness!” a boy boomed in a loud, deep voice. 
“We cover ourselves because there’s no color in the moon! No color in the stars! 
No color on the earth!” 

A girl spit black gunk over the hair of a short boy with glasses. The black 
liquid rolled slowly down his forehead and over his glasses. He bent to fill his 



cup, drank, and spit a gob of it down the front of the girl’s coat. 

Laughing and cheering, hooting at the top of their lungs, they sprayed each 
other. Spit and sprayed the hot black gunk until they were all drenched, all 
dripping, covered in oily blackness. 

“No color in the cup! No color in the drink!” 

And then the hands gripped me tighter. And Ben and I were pulled to the 
top of the hill. 

I gazed down the other side. And saw a steep drop. And down below, at the 
bottom... 

Too dark. 

I couldn’t see a thing. But I could hear the loud bubbling. I could see thick 
steam floating up, wave after wave of it. And I could smell the sharp, sour odor 
—so strong, I started to gag. 

“The Black Pit!” someone cried. “Into the Black Pit!” 

Lots of kids cheered. 

Ben and I were pushed to the edge of the dropoff. 

“Jump! Jump! Jump!” some kids began to chant. 

“Jump into the Black Pit!” 

“But—why?” I shrieked. “Why are you doing this?” 

“Cover yourself in blackness!” a girl screamed. “Cover yourself like us!” 

Kids laughed and cheered. 

Ben turned to me, his face twisted in fear. “It—it’s boiling hot down there,” 
he stammered, gazing into the bubbling pit below. “And it smells like dead 
animals!” 

“Jump! Jump! Jump!” kids began to chant. 

My eyes swept over them. Laughing. Cheering. The black goo running 
down their faces, down their clothes. The kids tossed their heads back and 
spewed gobs of black liquid into the air. 

“Jump! Jump! Jump!” 

Suddenly, the chanting and laughter stopped. I heard screams. 

Strong hands grabbed me around the waist from behind. And shoved me 
hard—into the steaming pit. 



24 


No. 

I didn’t fall. I didn’t go over the side. 

The hands held on to me. Spun me around. 

I squinted into a familiar face. Seth! 

“Run!” he cried. “We came to rescue you!” 

I turned and saw Mary and Eloise guiding Ben down the hill. 

“Let’s go!” Seth cried. 

We started to run. But we didn’t get far. 

The other kids had been startled at first. But they quickly got over their 
surprise. And formed a tight circle around us. 

“They’ve trapped us!” I cried. “How can we break through?” 

We stopped and stared at them as they began to circle us, moving silently, 
their faces smeared with the black liquid, their clothing drenched and stained. 

“I thought we could outrun them,” Seth started. “But—” 

1 lowered my gaze to a pile of dead leaves on the ground. And an idea 
flashed into my mind. 

I shoved my hand into the pocket of my khakis. 

“Get ready,” I warned the others. 

Ben turned to me. “Get ready for what?” he demanded. 

“Get ready,” I repeated. “Get ready to move.” 



25 


“Okay!” I cried. 

I raised the lighter. Clicked it once. Twice. 

A yellow flame shot up. 

“Owww!” a girl cried. 

Several other kids cried out. Some shielded their eyes or turned away from 
the flame. 

“Too bright!” a girl screamed. 

“My eyes! It hurts my eyes!” 

“Grab it! Grab it!” a boy wailed. 

But I wasn’t finished. 

I lowered the flame to the pile of leaves at our feet. The leaves caught 
instantly, with a loud WHOOOOSH. Bright orange flames roared up. 

“Nooooo!” The kids covered their eyes and cried out in pain. 

“Let’s go!” I called to Ben and the others. But I didn’t need to say it. They 
were already running over the dark grass. I lowered my head and ran after them. 

I heard kids screaming and crying behind us. 

“I can’t see! I can’t see!” 

“Somebody—do something!” 

“Put out the fire!” 

I glanced back. The pile of burning leaves sent up a darting wall of red- 
orange light. So bright against the black night sky. 

Covering their eyes, the kids were scrambling away, running in all 
directions. No one was chasing after us. 

Trotting hard through the foggy night, Seth and the two girls led us away 
from the hill. “We tried to warn you about the others,” Mary said breathlessly. 
“But you ran away. You wouldn’t listen.” 

“They’ve lost their minds,” Seth added sadly. “They can’t think straight 
anymore.” 

“They’re like some kind of wild gang now,” Eloise added. “They have their 
own laws. Their own strange traditions. They cover themselves in black goo 
every night. It’s—it’s really frightening.” 



“That’s why the five of us stay in the school,” Eloise explained. “We’re 
afraid of them too.” 

“They do horrible, crazy things,” Mary said. “They’ve given up all hope. 
They don’t care what they do.” 

I shivered. The gray moon had disappeared behind clouds again, and the air 
grew cold. The three gray kids seemed to fade with the moonlight. 

I heard shouts. From nearby. Excited voices. 

“They’re coming back!” I cried. 

“We’d better hurry,” Seth said. “Follow us.” 

He and the two girls turned and began mnning toward the street. Ben and I 
followed, keeping in the deep shadow of the tall hedges that lined the yards. 

I heard the shouts again, from close behind us. 

“Where are you taking us?” Ben asked in a breathless whisper. 

“Back to the school,” Seth replied. 

“To help us get out of this place?” I cried. “To help us back to our own 
world?” 

“No,” Seth replied without slowing his stride. “We told you, Tommy. We 
can’t help you go back. But you’ll be safer in the school with us.” 

“A lot safer,” Mary added. 

Jogging hard, Ben and I followed them through dark yards and over empty 
streets. The bare trees cracked and groaned overhead. The only other sound was 
the steady THUD of our shoes as we ran. 

I didn’t hear the other kids’ voices. But I knew they had to be nearby. Still 
searching for us. 

I breathed a sigh of relief when the little school building came into view. 
Ben and I hurried inside. We followed Seth and the two girls back to the large 
classroom. Mona and Eddie were waiting there for us. 

I sat down at a desk and struggled to catch my breath. When I looked up, I 
found all five kids staring wide-eyed at Ben and me. 

“What’s wrong?” I demanded. 

They didn’t answer for a long moment. Then, finally, Eloise said, “You’d 
better check yourself out in the mirror.” She pointed to a tall mirror near the 
elevator alcove. 

Ben and I made our way quickly to the mirror. 

My heart was pounding by the time I stepped in front of it. A heavy feeling 
of dread swept over me. 



I knew what I was about to see. 

But I prayed I was wrong. 

I took a deep breath—and gazed into the mirror. 



26 


“Nooooo.” Ben opened his mouth in a sorrowful moan. 

We stared at two gray figures. 

My khakis, my shirt. Gray now. My hair. My eyes. All of me. All in shades 
of gray. 

“We’re almost one of them,” Ben murmured. He uttered another moan. 
“What are the school colors here? Gray and gray?” He tried to laugh. But I saw 
his whole body tremble. 

“No—wait!” I cried. “Ben, look. We still have a little time!” 

I pointed into the mirror. 

My ears were gray. And the gray had spread over my lips and chin. But my 
cheeks still held their color. My cheeks and my nose. 

Ben’s face was the same. “That’s all that’s left,” he sighed. “The front of 
my face.” 

“We’re sorry,” Mary said, stepping up behind us. “We’re really sorry. In a 
few minutes, you’ll be gray like us.” 

“No—!” I insisted, spinning away from the mirror. “There’s got to be a 
way. Hasn’t anyone ever escaped?” 

Seth’s answer shocked me. 

“Yes,” he said softly. “One girl escaped from Grayworld. Just a few weeks 
ago.” 

“After fifty years, one of us made it back to the world,” Mona sighed. 

“How?” Ben and I cried at the same time. 

“How did she do it?” I demanded. 

They all shook their heads. “We don’t know,” Eloise replied sadly. “She just 
disappeared. We’ve been waiting for her to come back for us.” 

“When the elevator opened tonight, we thought it was her,” Eddie said. “We 
thought she had come back to rescue us.” 

Greta! 

Her face flashed into my mind. 

Of course! Greta, that strange girl with her gray eyes, her white-blond hair, 
her all-black outfits. 



Greta had escaped from Grayworld. Greta had returned to the world of 
color. No wonder she was so eager to get her hands on Thalia’s bright lipstick! 

Greta... 

Why hadn’t she returned to rescue her friends? 

How did she make her escape? 

My eyes traveled to the elevator at the back of the room. Open! I ordered it 
silently. Open up — now! Please open! 

But, of course, the gray doors remained shut. 

I shoved my hands into my khakis pockets. Thinking hard, trying to fight 
down my panic, I started to walk to the front of the room. 

Ben slumped into a chair, shaking his head sadly. “This can’t be 
happening,” he muttered. He pounded the desktop angrily. “This can’t be 
happening!” 

“Think, Tommy. Think,” I instructed myself out loud. “There’s got to be a 
way to stop the gray. There’s got to be a way to bring the color back. Think!” 

My mind raced. I was too frightened to think clearly. 

Every muscle in my body tensed. 

Thinking hard, I pulled out the plastic lighter from my pocket. Nervously, I 
twirled it between my fingers. Slid it from hand to hand. 

Think! Think! 

I fumbled with the lighter. It fell out of my hand and clattered onto the 
floor. 

I stared at it as I bent to pick it up. The lighter had been bright red. But now 
the plastic had faded to gray. 

But the flame... 

Suddenly, I had an idea. 

I stood up and turned to the others. I raised the lighter. “What if...” I 
started, thinking hard. Excited by my flash of hope. 

“What if I lit up the room with yellow light from the other world? Do you 
think the color—the yellow light—would wash away the gray?” 

“You already tried it—outside,” Ben reminded me. 

“But that was outside,” I replied. “What if I light it near the wall? Do you 
think the bright color will make the gray wall fade away so that we can escape to 
the other side, the side of color?” 

They stared back at me, their eyes locked on the lighter in my hand. 

I didn’t wait for their reply. 



“I’m going to try it,” I announced. 

I raised the plastic lighter high. 

Their eyes followed the lighter as I raised it high. 
“Good luck,” Ben whispered. “Good luck to us all.” 
I clicked the lighter. 

Clicked it again. 

Clicked it. 

Clicked it hard. 

It wouldn’t light. 



27 


I slammed the lighter onto the desktop. 

“It’s out!” I wailed. “I used it up. It’s out of fluid.” 

“No—” Ben cried. “Try it again, Tommy. Please—give it one more try.” 

I groaned and picked up the lighter. My hand was trembling. My throat 
suddenly felt so dry. 

It seemed like such a good idea. If only I could get it to flame. 

“Here goes,” I murmured, raising the lighter again. “One more try.” 

My palm slippery from sweat, I nearly dropped the lighter again. I tightened 
my grip on it. Raised my thumb. 

Clicked it. 

Clicked it again, harder. 

And the flame shot up. 

“Yesssss!” Ben cried. 

But his happy cry faded quickly. 

The flame leaping up from the lighter was gray. 

Everyone groaned. 

I stared at the gray flame, dancing on top of the gray lighter. Held tight in 
my gray fist. “It’s no use,” I choked out. 

I clicked off the flame and shoved the lighter back into my pocket. I turned 
to Ben. “Sorry,” I muttered glumly. “I tried.” 

Ben nodded, swallowing hard. 

I gasped. “Ben—your face! Your cheeks! ” 

“Gray?” he asked softly. 

I nodded. “Your nose is all that’s left,” I told him. “Your nose has the only 
color.” 

“Yours too,” he reported. 

The five gray kids stood in silence across the room. Seth shook his head 
sadly. 

What could they say? 

This had already happened to them. They had lived in a black-and-white 
world for fifty years. 



And now Ben and I were doomed to be part of that cold, gloomy world. 

I rubbed my nose. How long would it keep its color? I wondered. 

How long until I became one of them? 

My eyes wandered to the elevator. If only Ben and I had taken the stairs to 
the art room. If only... 

Too late to think about that now. 

I stared hard at the elevator doors. Once again, I silently ordered them to 
open. 

I let out a startled cry when I heard a loud, rumbling sound. 

Everyone jumped up. Alert. Listening. 

The rumble grew to a roar. “What’s happening?” Ben cried. 

“The elevator!” Eloise gasped, pointing. 

We all hurried across the room. We were just a few feet away—when the 
elevator doors slid open. 

We all stepped up to see who was inside. 

“Greta!” I cried. 



28 


No. Not Greta. 

To my shock, Thalia stood in the elevator doorway. 

She peered out tensely. Her blond hair gleamed in the elevator light. Her 
blue dress sparkled brightly. The color almost hurt my eyes. 

A red-lipped smile spread over her face. “I found you! I did it!” she cried 
happily. 

She came running out of the elevator. With a happy cry, she threw her arms 
around Mary and hugged her tight. Then she hugged Eloise and Seth, Mona and 
Eddie. 

Happy cries rang out from everyone. 

“Thalia—you came back!” 

“Are you okay?” 

“We’ve been waiting for you!” 

“Whoa—wait—the elevator!” I cried. “Don’t let it go!” 

I made a frantic dive. 

Too late. 

The doors slid shut. 

I crashed into them and bounced off. “Nooooo!” I let out a long, frantic 
wail. “Nooooooo! The elevator! The elevator!” I banged on the doors with both 
fists. 

I spun around to face Thalia. 

She gasped and raised a hand to her mouth. “Oh—I’m so sorry!” she cried. 
Her blue eyes grew wide. “I—I was so happy to see my friends, I forgot!” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

Trembling, I slumped against the wall. Our one chance to escape. Too 
late... too late... 

The five gray kids circled around Thalia, hugging her, laughing, asking her 
a thousand questions. 

“We missed you so much!” Eloise cried. “We waited for you to come back 
and rescue us.” 

“I missed you guys too,” Thalia told them. “I tried to come back. But I 



couldn’t find the way. I didn’t know how to get back here—until tonight.” 

She turned to Ben and me. “I escaped a few weeks ago,” she explained. 
“Just before school started. I went over to your world, the real world. But I had 
to disguise myself.” 

“You mean—” I started. 

“The makeup,” Thalia continued. “The makeup and the lipstick. I had to 
keep putting that stuff on all the time. To cover up my gray skin. I—” 

“But your eyes—” I interrupted. “They’re blue.” 

“Contact lenses,” she explained. She let out a long sigh. “It was so hard, so 
much work. I had to be so careful. I had to apply coat after coat of makeup and 
lipstick. I couldn’t let anyone know. 

“Kids made fun of me,” Thalia sighed. “But that wasn’t the worst part. I 
wanted to stay in the world of color and brightness. But I was a fake. A phony, 
covering up with makeup. I no longer belonged there. I belonged here in 
Grayworld.” 

Thalia sighed again. “But I couldn’t find the way back. Then tonight, you 
and Ben didn’t return to the gym. I went searching for you. I found the hole in 
the boarded-up wall. And I found the elevator. And it brought me here, to my 
friends.” 

“Welcome back,” Mary said, putting a gray arm around the shoulders of 
Thalia’s dress. The color on the dress had already started to fade. 

“You’re right. This is where you belong,” Seth told her. 

“When you escaped, we thought about you all the time,” Mona added. “We 
wondered how you were doing. And we wondered if you would come back for 
us.” 

“You don’t want to go there,” Thalia replied. “And I don’t want to go back. 
We don’t belong there. We cannot live there. I don’t want to pretend anymore. I 
just want to stay here with you and be myself.” 

She pulled a makeup kit and a tube of lipstick from her bag and tossed it 
down on a desktop. “No more makeup. No more lipstick. No more pretending.” 

“But what about us?” Ben cried. “Tommy and I have only a minute or two 
more before we’re totally gray!” 

“Aren’t you going to help us escape from here?” I pleaded. “Aren’t you 
going to help us get back?” 

Thalia shook her head sadly. “I’m sorry, guys.” 



29 


I swallowed hard, thinking about home. My dad. My new mom. My dog. 

I’ll never see them again, I realized. 

I’ll never see color again. Never see blue ocean waves or a red, setting sun. 

“I’m sorry, guys,” Thalia repeated. “Sorry I didn’t explain this to you right 
away.” 

“Explain what?” I cried. 

“I think I can get you back to the other side,” she said. 

She picked up her lipstick tube. “This is how I escaped a few weeks ago,” 
she said. “This lipstick tube was buried in my bag for fifty years. I’d forgotten all 
about it.” 

She unscrewed the cap and showed us the bright red lipstick. “I found it a 
few weeks ago. When I opened it, it was still red!” Thalia exclaimed. “It was 
some kind of miracle. Maybe because it had been closed up. It still had its 
color.” 

Thalia moved to the wall. “I was so excited to see the color red after fifty 
years,” she explained. “I started drawing on the wall with it. And to my shock, 
wherever I spread the lipstick, it made a hole in the wall!” 

“That’s amazing!” Eddie cried. 

The others excitedly agreed. 

“The lipstick burned right through the wall,” Thalia continued. “I—I was so 
shocked, I didn’t know what to do. I drew a window on the wall. And I climbed 
through it. I escaped. That’s how I did it.” 

She raised the lipstick tube to the gray wall. “I tried to come back for you 
guys,” she told her friends. “But the hole closed up as soon as I went through it.” 

She frowned. “I drew a lipstick window on the wall on the other side. But 
in the real world, lipstick is only lipstick. It didn’t work. I couldn’t get back to 
you. I had no way of finding you, no way to return here.” 

I glanced at Ben. To my horror, he had turned completely gray. Except... 
except for the tip of his nose. 

“Thalia—hurry!” I begged. “Draw a window for Ben and me! Please—we 
don’t have any time left!” 

Without another word, she turned to the wall. 



Her hand moved quickly, outlining a red window. Filling it in. 

“Hurry! Please, hurry!” I pleaded, staring as she frantically rubbed the red 
lipstick over the wall. 

Would it work? 



30 


As soon as she finished the window, I grabbed Ben. I shoved him through the 
hole. “Come on!” I cried. “We can do it!” 

“Good-bye, Ben. Good-bye, Tommy,” the others called. 

Halfway through the wall, I turned back to them. “Come with us!” I cried. 
“Hurry! You can come with us!” 

“No, we can’t,” Seth called sadly. 

“Thalia is right. We’d hate it. We belong here now,” Mary said. 

“Don’t forget me!” Thalia called. Her voice broke with sadness. She turned 
away. 

I turned too. Turned to the other world, our world. Ben and I stepped 
through the wall. And found ourselves back in school. 

I heard music booming down the hall. Kids shouting and laughing. 

The dance! 

We were back at the dance. 

With a gleeful shout, I shoved open the door to the boys’ room. Ben and I 
dove inside. Ran up to the mirror. 

Gaped at ourselves. 

Our colorful selves. 

All red and blue and pink and yellow. All in color! So many colors! 

We slapped each other high fives. And tossed back our heads and screamed 
out our happiness. Screamed and screamed. 

We were back. Back to normal. Back in the world. 

Back at the dance. 

We banged open the boys’ room door. Burst into the hall. 

And ran into Mrs. Borden. 

“There you are!” she cried. “I’ve been looking all over for you two!” 

She grabbed each of us by the hand and began tugging us down the hall. 

“Mrs. Borden—we have to tell you—” I started. 

“Later,” she interrupted. She pushed us into the gym. “We’ve all been 
waiting for you. You’ve held everyone up.” 

“But—you don’t understand !” I sputtered. 



“You want to be in the photo—don’t you?” Mrs. Borden demanded. Kids 
were lined up in front of the bleachers. She shoved Ben and me into the front 
row. 

“We want everyone who worked on the dance in the photo,” Mrs. Borden 
declared. 

She turned to the photographer behind his camera. “Okay, Mr. Chameleon,” 
she called. “You can take the shot now!” 

“Mr. who?” I cried. “No! Wait! Wait\”

WEREWOLF SKIN 


Goosebumps - 60 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


I stepped down from the bus and squinted into the sunlight. Shielding my eyes 
with one hand, I searched the small parking lot for Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta. 

I didn’t remember what they looked like. I hadn’t seen them since I was 
four, eight years ago. 

But the Wolf Creek bus station was so tiny. Just a little wooden shack in the 
middle of a big parking lot. I knew I couldn’t miss them. 

“How many suitcases?” the bus driver growled out of the side of his mouth. 
Despite the cold October air, he had a damp sweat stain on the back of his gray 
uniform. 

“Just one,” I said. I was the only passenger to get off at Wolf Creek. 

Across from the bus station, I saw a gas station and a one-block stretch of 
small stores. Beyond that, I could see the woods. The trees shimmered yellow 
and brown, the autumn leaves still clinging to their branches. Dry, brown leaves 
fluttered across the parking lot. 

The driver grunted as he hoisted up the sliding door to the baggage 
compartment. He pulled out a black bag. “This yours, kid?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. Thanks.” 

I shivered from a gust of cold wind. I wondered if Mom and Dad had 
packed enough warm clothes for me. They’d had to pack me up in such a hurry. 

They weren’t expecting to be called out of the country on business just 
before Halloween. They’d had to fly to France. And they’d had to find a place 
for me to stay for two weeks. Maybe longer. 

My aunt and uncle were the lucky winners! 

I adjusted the camera bag on my shoulder. I kept my camera on my lap the 
whole bus ride. I didn’t want it bouncing around in the baggage compartment. 

My camera is the most valuable thing I own. I don’t go anywhere without 
it. And I seldom let it out of my sight. 

The driver slid my suitcase over the pavement to me. He slammed shut the 
baggage compartment. Then he started back into the bus. “Someone picking you 
up?” 

“Yes,” I replied, searching for Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta again. 

A mud-splattered blue van squealed into the parking lot. The horn honked. I 



saw a hand waving to me from the passenger window. 

“There they are!” I told the bus driver. But he had already climbed back 
inside and shut the door. The bus hissed and groaned, and pulled away. 

“Alex—hi!” Aunt Marta called from the van. 

I picked up my suitcase and trotted over to them. The van screeched to a 
stop. Uncle Colin climbed out from behind the wheel. Aunt Marta came running 
from the other side. 

I didn’t remember them at all. I pictured them as young and dark-haired. 
But they were both pretty old-looking. They were both very tall and lean. As 
they hurried across the lot to me, they reminded me of two skinny grasshoppers 
with tufts of gray hair on their heads. 

Aunt Marta wrapped me in a hug. Her arms felt so bony. “Alex—it’s so 
wonderful to see you! I’m so glad you came!” she exclaimed. 

She let go quickly and backed away. “Uh-oh. I’m crushing your camera 
case!” 

I shifted it around my neck. “No, it’s a hard case,” I replied. “It’s okay.” 

Smiling, Uncle Colin shook hands with me. His wavy gray hair fluttered in 
the breeze. His cheeks were red and sort of cracked. Age lines, I guess. 

“You’re so big and grown-up,” he said, “I’m going to have to call you Mr. 
Hunter instead of Alex.” 

I laughed. “No one calls me Mr. Hunter—yet,” I told him. 

“How was the long bus ride?” he asked. 

“Bumpy,” I told him. “I don’t think the driver missed a single pothole! And 
the man next to me had the hiccups the whole way.” 

Aunt Marta chuckled. “Sounds like a fun trip.” 

Uncle Colin lowered his eyes to my camera case. “Like to take pictures, 
Alex?” 

I nodded. “Yes. I want to be a photographer someday. Just like you two.” 

Their smiles grew wider. That seemed to please them. 

But Uncle Colin’s smile faded quickly. “It’s a hard way to make a living,” 
he said. “Lots of traveling. We never stay in one place for long.” 

Aunt Marta sighed. “That’s why we haven’t seen you for so many years.” 
She hugged me again. 

“I was hoping maybe I could go out on a shoot with you,” I said. “I’ll bet 
you two could teach me a lot!” 

Uncle Colin laughed. “We’ll teach you all our secrets.” 



“You’re staying for at least two weeks,” Aunt Marta added. “So we’ll have 
plenty of time for photography lessons.” 

“Not if we spend the whole time in this parking lot!” Uncle Colin declared. 
With a groan, he hoisted my suitcase into the back of the van. 

We climbed in. And a few seconds later, we pulled away from the bus 
station, into town. 

A post office whirred past. Then a small grocery and a dry cleaner. We 
crossed a street, and thick woods surrounded us on both sides. 

“Is that all there is?” I cried. 

“Alex,” Aunt Marta replied, “you’ve just had the grand tour of Wolf 
Creek.” 

“Hope you won’t be bored in such a tiny town,” Uncle Colin added, turning 
the van sharply as the road curved through the trees. 

“No way!” I cried. “I really want to explore the woods.” 

I’m a city kid. I seldom even get to touch a tree. Going into the woods, I 
thought, will be so interesting—like visiting another planet. 

“I want to shoot a hundred rolls of film in the woods!” I declared. The van 
bumped hard, sending my head bouncing against the van roof. 

“Slow down, Colin!” Aunt Marta scolded. She turned back to me. “Your 
uncle only knows one speed —light speed.” 

“Speaking of light, we’ll show you some tricks for shooting outdoors,” 
Uncle Colin said, pressing his foot even harder on the gas pedal. 

“I’ve entered a photography contest back home,” I told them. “I want to 
snap a great Halloween photo. Something really wild to win the contest.” 

“Oh, that’s right. Halloween’s only a couple days off,” Aunt Marta said, 
glancing at my uncle. She turned back to me. “What do you want to be for 
Halloween, Alex?” 

I didn’t have to think about it. I’d already decided back home. 

“A werewolf,” I told her. 

“NO!” she screamed. 

Uncle Colin also let out a cry. 

The van plowed through a stop sign. I flew off the seat and hit the door 
hard. And stared helplessly through the bouncing windshield—as we swerved 
into the path of a roaring truck.

“AAAAAIIIII!” 

Was that me screaming? 

Our van rocked hard. I bounced again. Landed on my knees on the floor. 

Uncle Colin swerved onto the grassy shoulder. 

I saw a blur of red—and heard the truck roar past. Its horn blared angrily. 

Uncle Colin slowed to a stop under the trees. His wrinkled face had turned 
red. He swept both hands back over his thick gray hair. 

“Colin, what happened?” Aunt Marta asked softly. 

“Sorry,” he muttered. He took a deep breath. “Guess I just wasn’t 
concentrating.” 

Aunt Marta tsk-tsked. “Nearly got us killed.” She turned in the passenger 
seat to gaze at me. “Alex—you okay?” 

“Yes. I’m fine,” I told her. “I didn’t expect it to be so exciting here!” I tried 
to make a joke. But my voice came out kind of shaky. 

My camera case had fallen to the floor. I picked it up, opened it, and 
checked out the camera. It seemed okay. 

Uncle Colin shifted into Drive and pulled the van back onto the road. 
“Sorry about that,” he murmured. “I’ll be more careful. Promise.” 

“You were thinking about the Marlings again—weren’t you?” Aunt Marta 
accused him. “When Alex said werewolf, you started thinking about them, and 

55 

“Be quiet, Marta!” Uncle Colin snapped. “Don’t talk about them now. Alex 
just arrived. Do you want to scare him before we even get home?” 

“Huh? Who are the Marlings?” I demanded, leaning to the front. 

“Never mind,” Uncle Colin replied sharply. “Sit back.” 

“They’re not important,” Aunt Marta said. She turned to the windshield. 
“Hey—we’re almost home.” 

The sky seemed to darken. The old trees grew over the narrow road, their 
leaves blocking the sunlight. 

Watching the blur of red and yellow as the woods swept past, I thought 
hard. My aunt and uncle were certainly acting a little strange, I decided. I 
wondered why Uncle Colin had snapped at my aunt so angrily when she’d 



mentioned the Mailings. 

“Why do they call it Wolf Creek?” I asked. 

“Because the name Chicago was already taken!” Aunt Marta joked. 

“There used to be wolves in the woods,” Uncle Colin explained softly. 

“Used to be!” my aunt exclaimed. She lowered her voice to a whisper, but I 
could still hear her. “Why don’t you tell Alex the truth, Colin?” 

“Be quiet!” he repeated through clenched teeth. “Why do you want to scare 
him?” 

Aunt Marta turned to the passenger window. We drove on in silence for a 
while. 

The road curved, and a small circle came into view. Three houses stood 
nearly side by side on the circle. I could see the woods stretching on behind the 
houses. 

“That’s our house—in the middle,” Uncle Colin announced, pointing. 

I gazed out at it. A small, square white house on top of a neat, recently 
mowed front lawn. A long, low, ranch-style house—gray with black shutters— 
stood to the right. 

The house on the left was nearly hidden by overgrown bushes. Tall weeds 
rose up over the patchy front yard. A broken tree branch lay in the middle of the 
driveway. 

Uncle Colin pulled the van up the driveway to the middle house. “It’s small 
—but we’re not here that often,” he said. 

Aunt Marta sighed. “Always traveling.” 

She turned to me again. “There’s a nice girl who lives next door.” She 
pointed to the ranch-style house on the right. “She’s twelve. Your age, right?” 

I nodded. 

“Her name is Hannah. She’s very cute. You should make friends with her so 
you won’t be lonely.” 

Cute? 

“Any boys in the neighborhood?” I asked. 

“I don’t think so,” my aunt replied. “Sorry.” 

My uncle stopped the van at the top of the driveway. We climbed out. I 
stretched my arms over my head. All my muscles ached. I’d been sitting for over 
six hours! 

I glanced at the gray shingle house on the right. Hannah’s house. I 
wondered if she and I would become friends. 



Unde Colin unloaded my suitcase from the back of the van. 

I turned to the house on the left. What a wreck! The house was totally dark. 
Some shutters had fallen off. Part of the front porch had caved in. 

I crossed the driveway and took a few steps closer to the weird, run-down 
house. “Who lives there?” I asked my aunt. 

“Stay away from there, Alex!” Uncle Colin screamed. “Don’t ask questions 
about them! Just stay away from that house!”

“Calm down, Colin,” Aunt Marta told my uncle. “Alex isn’t going over there.” 

She turned to me. “The Marlings live in that house,” she said, lowering her 
voice to a whisper. She raised a finger to her lips. “No more questions—okay?” 

“Just stay away from there,” Uncle Colin growled. “Come help me unload 
the car.” 

I took one last glance at the run-down wreck of a house. Then I trotted over 
to help my uncle. 

It didn’t take long to unpack. Aunt Marta helped me in the guest room 
while Uncle Colin made us turkey sandwiches in the kitchen. 

My room was small and narrow, about the size of my closet back home. 
The tiny closet smelled of mothballs. But Aunt Marta said the odor would go 
away if we left the closet door and the window open. 

I crossed the tiny room to open the window. And saw that it faced the 
Marlings’ house next door. A rusted wheelbarrow tilted against the Marlings’ 
side wall. The windows were dark and coated with dust. 

I squinted into the window across from mine—and thought about Uncle 
Colin’s shouted warning. 

Why was he so worried about the Marlings? 

I raised the window and turned back to my aunt. She tucked the last of my 
T-shirts into the top dresser drawer. “The room is small. But I think you’ll be 
cozy here, Alex,” she said. “And I cleared all the junk off the desktop so you’ll 
have a place to do homework.” 

“Homework?” I uttered. 

Then I remembered. I’d promised to go to the local school for the weeks I 
stayed in Wolf Creek. 

“Hannah will take you to school Monday morning,” Aunt Marta promised. 
“She is in sixth grade too. She’ll show you around.” 

I didn’t want to think about going to a strange school. I picked up my 
camera. “I can’t wait to get into the woods and take some shots,” I told my aunt. 

“Why don’t you go after lunch?” she suggested. Straightening her gray hair, 
she led the way through the short hall to the kitchen. 

“All moved in?” Uncle Colin asked. He was pouring orange juice into three 



glasses. The sandwiches were set out on the small, round kitchen table. 

Before I could answer him, we heard a hard knock on the back door. Aunt 
Marta opened it, and a girl about my age walked in. Hannah. 

Hannah was tall and thin, an inch or two taller than me. Aunt Marta was 
right. Hannah was kind of cute. She had straight black hair, olive-green eyes, and 
a nice smile. She wore a big green sweater pulled down over black tights. 

Aunt Marta introduced us. We both said, “Hi.” 

I hate meeting new people. It’s always so awkward. 

Aunt Marta asked Hannah if she’d like a turkey sandwich. “No, thanks,” 
Hannah replied. “I already ate lunch.” 

I liked her voice. It was real low and husky. Kind of hoarse. 

“Alex just arrived on the bus,” Aunt Marta told her. “That’s why we’re 
having such a late lunch.” 

I gobbled my sandwich down in a few seconds. I guess I didn’t realize how 
hungry I was. 

“Hannah, why don’t you and Alex do some exploring in the woods?” Uncle 
Colin suggested. “He’s a city kid. You’ll have to show him what a tree is!” 

Everyone laughed. 

“I’ve seen lots of them in movies!” I joked. 

Hannah had a great, husky laugh. 

“I want to take a million photos,” I told her, grabbing my camera case. 

“You’re into photography?” Hannah asked. “Just like your aunt and uncle?” 

I nodded. 

“I hope you have color film,” Hannah said. “The fall leaves are really 
awesome now.” 

We said good-bye to Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta and headed out the front 
door. A red afternoon sun was sinking behind the trees. It made our shadows 
stretch long and skinny over the grass. 

“Hey—you’re stepping on my shadow!” Hannah protested, grinning. She 
swung her leg to make her shadow kick my shadow. 

“Ow!” I cried. I swung my fist, and my shadow slugged her shadow. 

We had a good shadow fight, punching and kicking. Finally, she stomped 
on my shadow with both of her sneakers. And I dropped to the ground, making 
my shadow slump over the grass in a dead faint. 

As I sat up, Hannah had her head tossed back, laughing. Her straight black 
hair blew wildly around her face. 



I pulled my camera from the case and quickly snapped a photo of her. 

She stopped laughing. And straightened her hair with both hands. “Hey— 
why did you do that?” 

I shrugged. “Just wanted to.” 

I climbed to my feet and raised the camera to my eye. I turned and pointed 
it toward the Marlings’ house next door. I took a few steps toward the house, 
trying to frame it in my viewfinder. 

“Hey—!” I cried out as Hannah grabbed my arm. 

“Alex—don’t take a picture!” she warned in a throaty whisper. “They’ll see 
you!” 

“So what?” I shot back. But I felt a shiver as I saw something move in the 
dark front window. 

Was someone staring out at us? 

I lowered my camera. 

“Come on, Alex.” Hannah tugged me toward the back. “Are we going into 
the woods or not?” 

I squinted up at the Marlings’ house. “Why was my uncle so upset when I 
asked about that house?” I asked Hannah. “What’s the big deal?” 

“I don’t really know,” she replied, dropping my arm. “The Marlings are 
supposed to be a weird old couple. I’ve never seen them. But... I’ve heard 
stories about them.” 

“What kind of stories?” I demanded. 

“Frightening stories,” she whispered. 

“No. Really. What kind of stories?” I insisted. 

She didn’t answer. Her olive-green eyes narrowed at the broken porch, the 
faded, stained shingles. “Let’s just stay away from there, Alex.” 

She started jogging along the side of the house toward the backyard. But I 
didn’t follow her. I crossed the driveway and stepped into the tall weeds of the 
Marlings’ front yard. 

“Alex—stop! Where are you going?” Hannah called. 

Holding my camera at my waist, I made my way quickly up to the house. 
“I’m a city kid,” I told Hannah. “I don’t scare easily.” 

“Alex, please—” Hannah pleaded. “The Marlings don’t like kids. They 
don’t like anyone coming up to their house. Please. Let’s go to the woods.” 

I stepped up carefully onto the rotting floorboards of the front porch. I 
raised my eyes to the front window. 



The reflection of the setting, red sun filled the glass. For a moment, it 
appeared that the window was on fire. 

I had to look away. 

Then, as the sunlight faded from the window-pane, I turned back—and 
gasped. 

Inside the house, the window curtains were slashed and torn. 

As if some kind of animal had clawed them, clawed them to shreds.

“Hannah—did you see this?” I called. I couldn’t take my eyes off the shredded 
curtains. 

She stood across the driveway, leaning her back against my aunt and 
uncle’s house. “I don’t want to come over there,” she said softly, folding her 
arms over her chest. 

“But the curtains—” I started. 

“I told you they’re weird,” Hannah said sharply. “And they don’t like kids 
gawking through their windows. Come on, Alex.” 

I backed away from the Marlings’ house. My shoe caught on a raised 
floorboard of the rotting porch, and I nearly fell. 

“Are we going to the woods or not?” Hannah asked impatiently. 

“Sorry.” I pulled my shoe free and followed her toward the back. “Tell me 
more about the Marlings,” I said, jogging to catch up to her. “Tell me some of 
the frightening stories you heard about them.” 

“No way,” Hannah replied in her breathy voice. 

We trotted across my aunt and uncle’s backyard. The tall yellow and red 
trees of the woods, tilting in afternoon shadows, stretched beyond the smooth 
lawn. 

“Please?” I begged. 

“Maybe in a few days, after Halloween,” Hannah replied. “After the full 
moon.” 

I followed Hannah’s gaze to the sky. A bright white moon—almost round as 
a tennis ball—rose over the trees, even though it was still daylight. 

Hannah shuddered. “I hate when the full moon comes,” she said. “I’ll be so 
happy when it’s gone.” 

“Why?” I demanded. “What’s the big deal about a full moon?” 

She gazed back at the Marlings’ house. And didn’t reply. 

We made our way through the trees. The fading sunlight filtered through the 
leaves, sending shimmering spots of gold over the ground. Our shoes crackled 
over twigs and dead leaves. 

I found a gnarled old tree, bent over like an old man. The bark was pitted 



and wrinkled like aged brown skin. Fat gray roots reached up from the dirt. 

“Wow! This is so cool\” I declared, pulling my camera from the case. 

Hannah laughed. “You really are a city kid.” 

“But—look at this tree!” I declared. “It’s like—it’s like it’s alive!” 

She laughed again. “Trees are alive, Alex!” 

“You know what I mean,” I grumbled. 

I started to snap photos of the bent, old tree. I stepped back and leaned 
against a tilted birch tree. I tried to frame the old tree so that its shape looked 
human. 

Then I moved all around the tree, photographing its creases, its wrinkles. I 
shot one slender branch that lowered itself to the ground like a weary arm. 

I dropped down to my knees and snapped the roots reaching up from the 
ground like skinny legs. 

A soft buzz made me raise my gaze. A hummingbird hovered over a 
flowering weed. I turned and tried to capture the tiny bird in my camera lens. 

But the hummingbird was too fast for me. It darted away before I could 
snap my shutter. 

I climbed to my feet. Hannah was sitting cross-legged on the ground, 
crunching dead leaves between her hands. 

“Doesn’t that hummingbird know summer is over?” I murmured. 

She stared at me blankly, as if she had forgotten I was there. “Oh. Sorry, 
Alex. I didn’t see it.” She climbed to her feet. 

“What happens if you keep going straight?” I asked, pointing deeper into 
the woods. 

“You come to Wolf Creek,” Hannah replied. “I’ll show you the creek next 
time. But we’d better get going. We should get out of the woods before the sun 
goes down.” 

I suddenly thought of the wolves Uncle Colin had told me about. The 
wolves that gave Wolf Creek its name. 

“The wolves that used to live here in these woods,” I said. “They’re all 
gone—right?” 

Hannah nodded. “Yes. They’re gone.” 

And then a shrill howl rose up—so close, so close behind me. The high, 
shrill wail of a wolf. 

And I opened my mouth in a terrified scream.

I stumbled back against the birch tree. My camera banged against the trunk, but I 
didn’t drop it. 

“Hannah—?” I choked out. Her eyes were wide with surprise. 

But before she could reply, two boys burst out from behind a tall evergreen 
shrub. They tossed back their heads and howled like wolves. 

“Hey —you guys!” Hannah exclaimed, making a disgusted face. 

They were both short and thin, both with straight black hair and dark brown 
eyes. They finished their howls, then gazed at me, gazed at me hungrily, like 
wolves. 

“Did we scare you?” one of them teased, his dark eyes flashing excitedly. 
He wore a dark brown sweater pulled down over black denim jeans. He had a 
long purple wool muffler wrapped around his neck. 

“You two always scare me!” Hannah joked. “Your faces give me 
nightmares!” 

The other boy wore a baggy gray sweatshirt and baggy khakis that dragged 
on the ground. He tossed back his head and let out another shrill wolf howl. 

Hannah turned to me. “They’re in my class,” she explained. “That one is 
Sean Kiner.” She pointed to the boy with the purple muffler. “And he’s Arjun 
Khosla.” 

“Arjun?” I struggled with the name. 

“It’s Indian,” he explained. 

“Hannah told us you were coming,” Sean said, grinning. 

“You’re a city kid, right?” Arjun asked. 

“Well, yeah. Cleveland,” I murmured. 

“So how do you like Wolf Creek?” Arjun asked. It didn’t sound like a 
question. It sounded like a challenge. 

They both stared at me with their dark eyes, studying me as if I were some 
kind of weird fungus. 

“I—I just got here,” I stammered. 

They exchanged glances. “There are some things you should know about 
the woods,” Sean said. 

“Like what?” I asked. 



He pointed to my feet. “Like you shouldn’t stand in a big clump of poison 

ivy!” 

“Huh?” I jumped back. And stared at the ground. 

They both laughed. 

There wasn’t any poison ivy. 

“You guys are about as funny as dog puke,” Hannah sneered. 

“You ought to know. You eat it for breakfast!” Sean replied. 

He and Arjun laughed and slapped each other a high five. 

Hannah sighed. “Remind me to laugh later,” she muttered, rolling her eyes. 
For some reason, that started the two boys howling again. 

When they stopped, Sean reached for my camera. “Can I see it?” 

“Well...” I pulled back. “It’s a very expensive camera,” I told him. “I really 
don’t like anyone else touching it.” 

“Ooooh. Expensive!” he teased. “Is it cardboard? Let me see it!” He 
grabbed for it again. 

“Take my picture,” Arjun demanded. He pulled his lips apart with two 
fingers and stuck out his tongue. 

“That’s an improvement!” Hannah told him. 

“Take my picture!” Arjun repeated. 

“Give Alex a break,” Hannah snapped. “Get out of his face, you two.” 

Arjun pretended to be hurt. “Why won’t he take my picture?” 

“Because he doesn’t take animal photos!” Hannah sneered. 

Sean laughed—and snatched the camera from my hands. 

“Hey—come on!” I pleaded. I made a grab for it and missed. 

Sean tossed the camera to Arjun. Arjun raised it and pretended to snap 
Hannah’s photo. “Your face cracked the lens!” he exclaimed. 

“I’m going to crack your face!” Hannah threatened. 

“It’s a really expensive camera,” I repeated. “If anything happens to it—” 
Hannah swiped the camera out of Arjun’s hands and handed it back to me. 

I cradled it in my arms. “Thanks.” 

The two boys moved toward me menacingly. Their dark eyes gleamed. 
Again, watching them approach, their faces so hard, their eyes so cold, I thought 
of wild animals. 

“Leave him alone,” Hannah scolded. 

“We’re just goofing,” Arjun replied. “We weren’t going to hurt the camera.” 



“Yeah. We’re just kidding around,” Sean added. “What’s your problem?” 

“No problem,” I replied, still cradling the camera. 

Arjun raised his eyes to the darkening sky. Through the trees I could see 
only gray. “It’s getting kind of late,” Arjun murmured. 

Sean’s smile faded. “Let’s get out of here.” His eyes darted around the 
woods. Shadows deepened, and the air grew colder. 

“They say some kind of wild creatures are loose in the woods,” Arjun said 
softly. 

“Arjun—give us a break,” Hannah groaned, rolling her eyes. 

“No. Really,” Arjun insisted. “Some kind of creature tore off a deer’s head. 
Tore it clean off.” 

“We saw it,” Sean reported. His dark eyes glowed excitedly in the dimming 
light. “It was so gross!” 

“The deer’s eyes stared up at us,” Arjun added. “And bugs crawled out of 
its open neck.” 

“Yuck!” Hannah exclaimed, covering her mouth with one hand. “You’re 
making this up—right?” 

“No. I’m not.” Sean glanced up at the moon. 

“It’s almost a full moon. The full moon makes all the strange creatures 
come out of hiding,” he continued, speaking so softly, his voice just above a 
whisper. “Especially at Halloween. And the moon will be completely full that 
night.” 

I shivered. The back of my neck tingled. I suddenly felt cold all over. 

Was it the wind? Or Sean’s frightening words? 

I pictured the deer head lying on the ground. 

Pictured the shiny black eyes staring up blankly, lifelessly. 

“What are you going to be for Halloween?” Arjun asked Hannah. 

She shrugged. “I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.” 

He turned to me. “Do you know what you want to be, Alex?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. I want to be a werewolf.” 

Arjun uttered a near-silent gasp. The two boys exchanged glances. 

Their smiles faded. Their faces turned solemn. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked. 

No reply. 

“Hey—what’s wrong?” I repeated. 

Arjun lowered his gaze to the ground. “We have enough werewolves in 



Wolf Creek,” he murmured. 

“What do you mean?” I cried. “Come on, guys—what do you mean by 
that?” 

But they didn’t answer. 

Instead, they turned and vanished into the woods.

Aunt Marta invited Hannah to stay for dinner. The four of us squeezed around 
the small kitchen table and spooned up big bowls of steaming chicken soup. 

“You make the best soup!” Hannah told my aunt. 

Aunt Marta smiled. A little broth dripped down her chin. She reached for 
her napkin. “Thank you, Hannah. I just throw everything in it I can find.” 

“Sorry we were late for dinner,” I said. “I lost track of time. I didn’t want to 
leave the woods. It was so interesting.” 

Uncle Colin’s eyes moved to the kitchen window. He stared up at the rising 
moon. Then he lowered his gaze to the Marlings’ house next door. 

“I photographed an awesome-looking tree,” I told him. “It was wrinkled 
and bent over like an old man.” 

Uncle Colin didn’t reply. His eyes were still focused out the window. 

“Colin—Alex is talking to you,” Aunt Marta scolded. 

“Huh? Oh.” He turned back to the table, shaking his head as if shaking 
away his thoughts. “Sorry. What were you saying?” 

I told him again about the old tree. 

“I’ll help you develop those shots,” he offered. “Maybe tomorrow. I set up a 
darkroom in the little bathroom in the attic. We really need a bigger house. 
Especially with all the work we’ve been doing lately.” 

“What are you photographing now?” I asked. 

“Creatures of the night,” he replied. His eyes wandered to the window 
again. I followed his gaze to the Marlings’ back window. Totally dark. 

“We’re photographing nocturnal animals,” Aunt Marta explained. “Animals 
that come out only at night.” 

“You mean like owls?” Hannah asked. 

Aunt Marta nodded. “We’ve found some wonderful owls in the woods— 
haven’t we, Colin?” 

Uncle Colin turned back from the window. Silvery light from the full moon 
washed over the windowpane. “The night creatures don’t like to be 
photographed,” he said, spooning up a carrot and chewing it slowly. “They are 
very private.” 

“Sometimes we wait in one spot for hours,” my aunt added. “Waiting for a 



creature to poke its head up from its hole in the ground.” 

“Can I come with you one night?” I asked eagerly. “I can be real quiet. 
Really.” 

Uncle Colin swallowed a chunk of chicken. “That’s a fine idea,” he said. 
But then his expression grew solemn. And he added, “Maybe after Halloween.” 

I turned and saw Aunt Marta staring out at the Marlings’ house. “The moon 
is still low,” she said thoughtfully. “But it’s so bright tonight.” 

“Almost like daylight out there,” Uncle Colin said. What was that 
expression that quickly passed over his face? Was it fear ? 

My aunt and uncle are both acting so weird tonight, I decided. So nervous. 

Why do they keep staring out the window? What do they expect to see at 
the Marlings’ house? 

I couldn’t hold it in any longer. “Is everything okay?” I asked them. 

“Okay?” Uncle Colin narrowed his eyes at me. “I guess...” 

“Are you two thinking about your Halloween costumes?” Aunt Marta 
demanded, changing the subject. 

“I think I’m going to be a pirate again this year,” Hannah replied. She 
finished her chocolate milk and licked the chocolate syrup on the edge of the 
glass. “You know. I’ll wrap a bandanna around my head and wear a patch over 
one eye.” 

“Colin and I might have some funny old clothes you can wear,” Aunt Marta 
offered. She turned to me. “How about you, Alex?” 

I still wanted to be a werewolf. But I remembered the last time I’d told that 
to my aunt and uncle. Uncle Colin had nearly cracked up the car! 

So I smiled and quietly told them, “Maybe I’ll be a pirate too.” 

I spooned up the last of my soup. 

I had no way of knowing that in a few hours, when the moon rose to its 
peak in the sky, I’d be nearly face-to-face with a real werewolf.

After Hannah went home, I made my way to my little bedroom. I straightened up 
a bit, shoving clothes into the dresser drawers. 

I’m not the neatest person in the world. Let’s face it—I’m a total slob. But I 
knew if I let the clutter pile up in this tiny room, I’d never find anything. 

I sat down at the desk and wrote a short letter to Mom and Dad. I told them 
everything was fine. I wrote that I’d have at least a thousand great photographs 
to show them when they came home from France. 

When I finished addressing the letter, I wasn’t feeling sleepy. But I decided 
I should probably go to bed, anyway. 

I started to the closet to find my pajamas. But I stopped at the window. 

And stared out at a pale orange light. 

Alight in a side window of the Marlings’ house! 

The light shimmered between two tilting trees, their leaves vibrating in the 
wind. A pale orange rectangle of light on the bottom floor of the house, near the 
back. 

A bedroom window? 

I pressed closer to the glass and squinted hard into the darkness. Squinted 
into the dim rectangle of orange. 

Was I about to see one of the Marlings? I held my breath and waited. 

I didn’t have to wait long. 

I let out a gasp as a silhouette crossed the window next door. A gray figure 
caught in the rectangle of orange. 

Was it a man? 

I couldn’t tell. 

The silhouette moved. It’s an animal, I realized. 

No. A man. 

Mr. Marling? 

I pressed against the glass, squinting hard. Was it a large dog? A man? I 
couldn’t see clearly. 

The silhouette moved away from the window. 

And then I heard a long, high animal wail. 



The sound floated out through the window next door. Floated across the 
narrow space between our houses. 

The high, animal howl swept into my room. Swirled around me. 

Such an ugly, frightening sound. Half-human, half-animal. A cry I had 
never heard before. 

A chill rolled down my back. And then another. 

Another howl made me gasp. 

I stared out as the silhouette returned to the window. A creature with its 
head tilted back. Its jaws open, uttering such frightening animal cries. 

I’ve got to take a picture, I told myself. I’ve got to photograph the howling 
silhouette. 

I spun away from the window. Dove across the tiny room to the dresser. 

Reached for my camera. 

My camera? 

It was gone. 



8 


“No—!” I uttered a shocked cry. 

My hands fumbled frantically over the desktop. 

I left the camera there. I knew I had. 

But no. No camera. 

My eyes swept around the room. I had just straightened up. Everything was 
in place. The desktop. The dresser. 

No camera. No camera. 

I dropped to my knees and searched under the bed. 

No camera. 

I crawled over to the closet. Pulled open the door. And searched the closet 
floor. 

As I searched, another wolf howl burst into my room. Higher. Shriller. 

And then I heard two howls together. The sirenlike wails blending in a 
strange, sour harmony. 

Was it Mr. and Mrs. Marling? 

As I climbed to my feet, I heard a scraping sound. Wood against wood. 

The sound of a window opening. 

I heard a heavy THUD. 

Feet landing hard on the ground. 

And then I heard low grunts. Heavy, thudding footsteps. 

Footsteps right outside my room! 

I dove back to the window. Breathlessly, my heart pounding, I stared out. 

Too late. 

No one out there now. 

All dark. The orange light gone from the Marlings’ window. The house 
completely covered in black again. 

The trees shaking, black against the blue-black sky. The leaves silvery, 
shimmering under the bright light of the moon. 

I stared out there for a long moment, waiting for my heart to stop racing. 
Fistening for the high howls, the heavy, thudding footsteps. 

Silence now. 



My camera... 

I forced myself to turn away from the window. I hurried out of the room 
and down the short hall to the living room. Did I leave the camera case here 
when Hannah and I returned from the woods? 

No. No sign of it. 

I checked the kitchen. Not there, either. 

“Aunt Marta! Uncle Colin!” I called them. My voice came out tinier than 
I’d planned. 

I ran back down the hall. Past my room. Past the bathroom and the linen 
closet. Their room stood at the end. “Have you seen my camera anywhere?” I 
cried. 

I shoved open the door to their bedroom. 

Dark in there. Dark and empty. 

I could smell Aunt Marta’s flowery perfume. And the sharp odor of photo- 
developing fluid. 

They’ve gone out to the woods to photograph animals, I realized. 

I’m all alone here. 

I took a deep breath and held it. Calm down, Alex, I instructed myself. 
You’re perfectly okay. You’re perfectly safe. 

You will find your camera as soon as you get calm. It’s probably right out in 
plain sight. But you’re so crazy and pumped up, you can’t see it. Just calm 
down! 

I took another long, deep breath. I was starting to feel calmer. 

I closed my aunt and uncle’s bedroom door and started back down the hall. 

I was halfway to my room when I heard the soft, scraping sound. 

And then the thud of footsteps. 

I froze. And listened. 

More footsteps. Heavy thuds. 

Where were they coming from? 

Overhead? 

Yes. 

I peered up at the low ceiling. 

Another scraping sound. More thudding footsteps. They’re in the attic! I 
realized. Whatever those howling creatures are— they’re in the house! 



9 


I dropped back against the wall. My whole body shook. 

I swallowed hard. And listened to the heavy footsteps above my head. 

I’ve got to get out of here! I told myself. I’ve got to get out of this house! 

I’ve got to tell Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta! 

But my legs felt like Jell-O. I didn’t know if I could walk. 

I took a shaky step. Then another. 

And then I heard a new sound from upstairs. 

I stopped and listened. 

Humming? Was someone humming? 

With a burst of energy, I grabbed the door to the attic. I pulled it open and 
shouted up the stairs, “Who’s up there? Who is it?” 

“It’s me, Alex!” a familiar voice called down. 

“Hannah—?” I choked out. I stared up to the attic. “Wh-what are you doing 
up there?” 

“Didn’t your aunt tell you I came back?” Hannah called. 

“No, she didn’t,” I replied. 

“She said she had some old clothes up here that might make a good 
costume. So I came back to check it out.” 

Her head appeared at the top of the stairs. “Why do you sound so weird?” 

“I—I thought—” I began. But the words caught in my throat. 

I started up the stairs. 

“No—!” Hannah cried. “Don’t come up!” 

I stopped on the third step. “How come?” I called. 

“I’m not dressed. I’m trying on stuff,” she explained. She smiled down at 
me. “Besides, I want to surprise you. There’s some awesome old stuff up here. 
Your aunt and uncle must have looked really weird when they were young.” 

Her head disappeared from view. I could hear the rustle of clothes up there. 

I backed down the stairs. “Hey—do you know where my camera is?” I 
asked. “I’ve looked all over the house, and—” 

“Oh, no!” Hannah groaned. Her head appeared again. This time she wasn’t 
smiling. 



“What?” I called up to her. 

“Your camera, Alex. Do you think maybe you left it in the woods?” 

I gasped. “I don’t know. I thought...” My voice trailed off. I had a sick, 
heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

“You had it when Sean and Arjun left,” Hannah said. “But when we came 
back to the house, I don’t remember you carrying it.” 

“Oh, wow!” I shook my head. “I’ve got to go get it, Hannah. I can’t leave it 
overnight in the woods.” 

“No —/” she cried. “Alex, listen to me. You can’t go out there.” 

“I have to!” I cried. 

“But the woods aren’t safe at night,” she protested. “They really aren’t 
safe.” 

I turned away and ran down the hall. I pulled on my jacket and found a 
flashlight on the floor of the hall closet. I tested it a few times. The light was 
steady and bright. 

“I’ll be back in a few minutes,” I shouted up to Hannah. 

“No—please, Alex!” I heard her call down. “Listen to me! Don’t go into the 
woods tonight! Wait for me to get dressed. Just wait for me—okay?” 

But I couldn’t leave my camera out there to be ruined. 

I closed the front door behind me and stepped out into the light of the 


moon. 



10 


I began trotting along the side of the house toward the backyard. Heavy black 
clouds covered the moon. The night air felt colder than I’d thought. Wet. I 
zipped my down jacket as I ran. 

I glanced at the Marlings’ house as I jogged past. Nothing to see there. The 
back window had been left wide open. But the house was completely dark. Not a 
light on anywhere. 

The grass was slick and wet from a heavy dew. I felt a splash of cold on my 
forehead. 

A raindrop? 

I groaned as I thought of my camera, sitting out in the woods. It was such 
an expensive camera. I prayed I could find it before it started to rain. 

Several tiny animals scampered silently past my feet. 

I stopped. 

No. Not animals. Fat, dead leaves. They scuttled over the dark grass, 
pushed by swirls of wind. 

I lowered my head under a tree branch and entered the woods at the back of 
the yard. The old trees shivered and creaked. 

The steady WHOO of an owl, far in the distance, made me think of my aunt 
and uncle. They were here with their cameras somewhere in the woods. I 
wondered if I would run into them. 

I followed the twisting path through the trees. Another raindrop fell heavily 
on the top of my head. Rain spattered the ground. 

I stopped when the bent tree came into view. The tree I had photographed 
with Hannah that afternoon. I played my flashlight over its curved shape. 

“At least I’m heading in the right direction,” I said out loud. 

I stepped over a fallen tree branch and moved deeper into the woods. The 
trees began to hiss, the leaves shaking in the rising wind. I could still hear the 
owl’s steady WHOO WHOO in the distance. 

My flashlight dimmed, then brightened again. Its thin circle of light made a 
path for me between the trees. 

“All right!” 

I cried out when the light swept over my camera case. I had set it down on a 



flat tree stump. How could I have forgotten it there? 

With another happy cry, I picked it up. I actually felt like hugging it. I was 
so happy to have it back. I checked it out carefully, turning it under the 
flashlight. 

I wiped away the few raindrops that clung to the top. Then, cradling it 
under one arm, I started back to the house. 

The rain had stopped, at least for a moment. I started to hum happily. I 
wanted to skip all the way home! 

The camera meant more to me than anything. I promised myself I’d never 
leave it anywhere again. 

I stopped humming when I heard the angry sound. 

An animal snarl. A fierce, throaty roar. 

I dropped the flashlight. 

The creature roared again. 

Where was it? Where was it coming from? 

Right behind me! 



11 


I bent and grabbed up the flashlight. My knees suddenly felt weak. A cold wave 
of panic swept over my body. 

I heard loud animal grunts. Another angry snarl. 

I forced myself to move. I had to get away from here. 

A clump of fat shrubs rose up in front of me. Clutching my camera case, I 
darted behind them. And dropped to my knees. 

Hidden behind the bushes, I struggled to catch my breath. To stop my heart 
from thudding so hard in my chest. 

I couldn’t see around the fat leaves of the bush. But I could hear the 
animal’s grunts and growls. I ducked lower, hoping I was completely out of 
view. 

Hoping it couldn’t smell me. 

And then I heard the crash of heavy feet on the ground. A high wail of 
anger, like a cry of attack. 

A frightened bleat rose up. So high and tiny. A terrified cry—cut off 
quickly. 

Snapped off. 

Leaning into the shrub, my legs trembling, my whole body shaking, I heard 
a struggle. 

So close. So close, I felt I could stand up—reach out—and touch the 
attacker and his prey. 

So close, I heard every grunt, every frightened cry. 

A thud. A growl. Another tiny, helpless bleat. 

A loud ripping sound. 

Wet chewing. The slap of jaws. More rapid chewing. An animal burp. 
Another ripping sound. 

I shut my eyes, picturing what was happening right in front of me. 

I heard a thud. Then silence. 

The hiss of the wind seemed to grow louder. 

A hiss... then silence. 

I opened my eyes. 



I stood up shakily. 

And heard heavy footsteps. Twigs and leaves crackling under heavy feet. 
The footsteps approaching rapidly. Coming my way. 

Coming for me. The creature—the hungry creature—was moving toward 
me. 

“Ohhhh.” A low cry of terror escaped my throat. 

Gripping the camera case tightly, I spun away from the clump of shrubs. 
And started to run. 

I heard animal grunts behind me. Heavy-breathing pants. 

I didn’t glance back. 

I ran deeper into the woods. I thought I heard the splash and trickle of a 
creek on my right. Wolf Creek? I didn’t stop to see. 

A branch scratched my cheek as I scrambled past it. Pain shot over my face. 
I raised one arm to shield myself as I ran. 

Ran blindly. Ran through the darkness. 

Where was the flashlight? 

Oh, no. I’d left it behind in the bushes. 

It was of no use to me, anyway. I was running too fast to keep to the path. 

I lowered my shoulder and pushed my way through a patch of tall reeds. 
They snapped back, slapping me wetly as I shot through them. 

My foot caught on a half-buried rock. I slid off it, somehow keeping my 
balance. 

I leaped over an upraised tree root—and kept running. 

Over the harsh gasps of my breath, I listened for the heavy, thudding 
footsteps behind me. The animal growls. 

Was the creature still chasing me? 

I grabbed a smooth, damp tree trunk and stopped. I hugged the trunk, 
struggling to keep my legs from collapsing, struggling to catch my breath. 

I turned and gazed back. 

Nothing there. 

No growls. No grunts. No bang of heavy feet on the ground. 

I sucked in breath after breath. My lungs burned. My mouth felt so dry, I 
couldn’t swallow. 

I’m okay, I told myself. I’m safe—for now. 

I gazed into the deep darkness. 

And the creature hit me from behind. 



12 


“Hunh—!” 

I uttered a startled groan. And dropped to the ground. 

I spun around to face my attacker. 

No one there. 

Nothing. 

“Huh?” A shocked cry escaped my lips. 

I started to scramble to my feet—and saw what had hit the back of my head. 
A bird’s nest. A dried-up, broken bird’s nest. It must have fallen from a tree 
limb above my head. Probably shaken loose by the gusts of wind. 

“Oh, wow.” I shook twigs from my hair. Then, cradling the camera case 
under my arm, I gazed around. 

Where was I? 

Trees up ahead slanted as if leaning against each other. A low mound of 
rocks stood at the edge of a ridge of tall reeds. 

I’m lost, I realized. 

I gazed up at the sky. No moon. The heavy rain clouds covered the moon 
and stars. 

How do I get back? I squinted into the darkness, searching for the path. 
Searching for anything I might recognize. 

Nothing. 

If I could find the creek, maybe I could find the spot where I found my 
camera, I decided. 

But which direction was the creek? 

I was completely turned around. 

I shivered. A cold raindrop spattered on the shoulder of my jacket. 

I jumped. That bird’s nest had made me terrified of things falling from the 

sky! 

What should I do? 

My mind whirred frantically with ideas. 

Should I call out for help? Shout to my aunt and uncle? Maybe if I called 
loud enough, they would hear me. 



But, no. If I shout, the animal—the snarling creature—will hear me first. 

Was it still searching for me? Was it still nearby? 

I decided I’d better not call for help. 

What should I do? What ? 

Start walking in one direction? And just keep going no matter what? 

No. I remembered a book I’d read where a guy was lost in the desert. And 
he tried walking in a straight line. And he just made circles. He went around and 
around and didn’t even realize it until he saw his own footprints in the sand! 

Maybe I should wait until the sun comes up, I decided. I’ll never find my 
way in this darkness. When it’s daylight, I’ll have a much better chance. 

I didn’t like the idea of spending the night in the woods. But waiting here 
until I could see where I was going seemed like a good idea. 

But then I heard a clattering sound. And felt the rain start to pound down 
hard. A freezing rain, swept by gusting wind. 

I can’t stay here, I realized. 

I have to get back to the house. 

I walked and walked, trying to retrace my steps. I sighed with relief when I 
finally came to the clump of bushes where I’d hid. I found the flashlight and 
gripped it tightly in my free hand. 

I took a guess on which direction to go next. 

Ducking my head against the rain, I started to walk again. 

Less than a minute later, I stumbled over something. 

Something soft. 

I landed on my knees. Turned back to see what I had tripped over. 

And let out a cry of horror. 



13 


The flashlight trembled in my hand. The quivering light revealed an ugly picture. 

I gaped down at an animal body. No. Two. 

Two animals. 

What were they? I couldn’t tell. They’d been clawed to pieces. 

Completely ripped apart. 

I remembered the ripping sounds I’d heard. The sounds of these animals 
being torn apart. My stomach lurched. 

What kind of animal did this? 

What kind of animal was strong enough to tear other creatures apart? 

A chill ran down my back. 

I pulled myself to my feet. I forced myself to look away. 

The rain poured down. I shielded my camera case under my jacket—and 
started to run again. 

I had to get away from that ugly sight. Would I ever be able to forget it? 

The wind whipped the rain around me. I felt as if I were running through 
ocean waves. But I couldn’t stop. 

My fear kept me running. 

That fierce creature still lurked in these woods. Still growled and hunted, 
somewhere nearby. 

My sneakers were soaked. I slipped and slid in the soft mud. 

I’m not sure how long I ran. I stopped when I nearly ran right into the 
creek. Pounded by the rain, it splashed over its low bank. 

I turned and followed it, feeling a little more confident. After a while, I 
spotted a narrow path cut through the tilting trees. 

I turned onto the path. Would it lead me out of the woods? I had to try it. 

The rain slowed to a soft patter. My sneakers sank deep into the mud as I 
trotted along the curving path. 

Soon I came to the bent, old-man tree. 

“Yes!” I cried out loud. “Yes!” I waved my fist triumphantly in the air. I 
was almost home. 

I picked up my pace. A few minutes later, I burst out of the woods, into my 



aunt and uncle’s backyard. 

I was so happy! I wanted to fly! 

I couldn’t wait to get into the warm house. To pull off my soaked clothes 
and get into something dry. 

But I stopped in the middle of the backyard. 

And stared into the circle of yellow light from my flashlight. 

Stared down at the strange footprints in the wet grass. 

Deep, rutted footprints heading into the Marlings’ backyard. 

I bent into the light to see them better. They weren’t human footprints. They 
were too long and too wide and shaped differently from human feet or shoes. 

Animal footprints. 

Keeping the beam of light in front of me, I trailed the footprints, following 
them over the grass. 

Across the Marlings’ weed-choked backyard. 

I stopped when I saw where the strange footprints led. 

Right up to the Marlings’ open bedroom window. 



14 


When I came into the kitchen for breakfast the next morning, Aunt Marta was on 
the phone. She stood at the counter with her back to me. But she turned as I said 
good morning to my uncle, and flashed me an angry look. 

“Yes, I understand,” she said into the phone. “Well, it won’t happen again.” 

I took my place at the table beside Uncle Colin. He sipped from a white 
coffee mug, his eyes on Aunt Marta. 

“It won’t happen again,” my aunt repeated into the phone. She frowned. 
“I’ll make sure he stays away. No. He wasn’t spying on you, Mr. Marling.” 

So that’s who she was talking to. 

Uncle Colin shook his head unhappily. “I warned you not to go near that 
place, Alex,” he said. “We don’t need those people calling over here.” 

“Sorry,” I murmured. “But—” 

I wanted to tell him about last night, about everything that had happened to 
me and everything I’d seen. 

But he raised a finger to his lips, motioning for me to be silent while my 
aunt was on the phone. 

“No. My nephew wasn’t taking pictures of your house, Mr. Marling,” Aunt 
Marta continued. She rolled her eyes. “I promise. He won’t bother you again. I’ll 
talk to him right now. Yes. Okay. Good-bye.” 

She set down the receiver and turned to Uncle Colin with a sigh. “Those 
people,” she murmured. 

“We have to be careful,” Uncle Colin replied, narrowing his eyes at me. 
“We don’t want to get them worked up.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. “I saw things—” 

“They saw you, Alex,” my aunt interrupted. “They saw you prowling 
around their house late last night. They are very angry about it.” 

She poured herself a mug of coffee and came over to the table. She sat 
down and swept a strand of gray hair off her forehead. 

“What were you doing outside last night?” my uncle asked. 

“I’m really sorry. But I had no choice. I left my camera out in the woods,” I 
explained. “I had to run out and get it. I couldn’t leave it out all night— 
especially with the rain.” 



“But you didn’t have to go near the Marlings’ house—did you?” Aunt 
Marta demanded. 

“I—I heard animal howls from inside their house!” I blurted out. “And I 
saw strange footprints going up to the bedroom window at the side.” 

Unde Colin nodded calmly. He took a long sip of coffee. “The footprints 
were probably from their dogs,” he said, glancing at Aunt Marta. 

“Dogs?” I cried. 

They both nodded. “They have two huge German shepherds,” my aunt 
explained. “Mean as they come.” 

“And as big as wolves,” Uncle Colin added, shaking his head. He reached 
for a slice of toast and began to butter it. 

I sighed. I felt a little better. 

Two German shepherds. That explained the howls and the footprints in the 
wet grass. 

“Are you ready for school?” Aunt Marta asked. “Hannah will be here any 
minute.” 

“I’m almost ready,” I replied. I gulped down a glass of orange juice. “When 
I was in the woods last night...” I started. 

They both stared at me. 

“I saw some animals that got ripped up. I mean, killed.” 

Uncle Colin nodded. “The woods are dangerous at night,” he said softly. 

“We really don’t want you out there at night, Alex,” Aunt Marta said. She 
pulled a piece of lint off the shoulder of my T-shirt. Then she tenderly brushed 
my hair back with her hand. “Promise us you won’t go again.” 

“Promise,” I murmured. 

“And promise that you’ll stay away from the Marlings,” my uncle added. 

Before I could reply, the doorbell rang. Hannah came into the kitchen, 
weighted down under a bulging backpack. “Ready?” she asked. 

I nodded and shoved my chair back from the table. “Yeah. I guess I’m 
ready,” I told her. “This is so weird. Going to someone else’s school.” 

“You’ll like my teacher, Mr. Shein,” Hannah replied. “He’s very interesting. 
And he’s really nice.” 

I grabbed my backpack and my jacket. We said good-bye to my aunt and 
uncle and headed out the front door. 

I glanced at the Marlings’ house as we made our way to the street. The 
bedroom window at the side had been closed, I saw. The house was dark as 



always. 

“Did you find your camera?” Hannah asked. 

I nodded. “Yeah. But it wasn’t easy.” I told her about my scary adventures. 

She tsk-tsked. “I warned you, Alex,” she said. “You wouldn’t catch me in 
the woods after dark.” 

A yellow school bus rumbled past. Some kids in the bus called out the 
window to Hannah. She waved back to them. 

The morning sun still floated low in the sky. A silvery frost clung to the 
lawns. The air felt crisp and cold. 

“One more block to school,” Hannah said. “Are you nervous?” 

I didn’t answer. I was thinking about the Marlings. I told Hannah about the 
howls I’d heard inside their house. “Uncle Colin says they have two German 
shepherds. Really big and really mean,” I told her. 

“No, they don’t,” Hannah replied sharply. 

I stopped walking. “Excuse me?” I cried. 

“The Marlings don’t have any dogs,” she repeated. “I’ve lived here as long 
as they have, and I’ve never seen them.” 

“Then why did my uncle tell me that?” I demanded. 

“So you won’t be scared,” Hannah replied. 

“I—I don’t understand,” I stammered. “If the Marlings don’t have dogs, 
what made those weird footprints outside their window?” 

Hannah shook her head. Her olive-green eyes locked onto mine. “Alex, 
don’t you get it?” she cried. “Haven’t you figured it out yet?” 

“Figured what out?” I asked. 

“The Marlings are werewolves!” Hannah declared. 



15 


Why is everyone in Wolf Creek obsessed with werewolves? I wondered. 

I laughed at Hannah and teased her the rest of the walk to school. I mean, 
how could anyone actually believe in werewolves today? 

“You’re only trying to scare me,” I told her. “But I don’t scare easily— 
remember? I saw one of the German shepherds. It was howling in the Marlings’ 
window.” 

Hannah shrugged. “Believe what you want to believe,” she murmured. 

“Don’t try to scare me with werewolves anymore,” I told her. 

But I had a surprise when we arrived at school. Even Mr. Shein, the sixth- 
grade teacher, wanted to talk about werewolves all morning! 

He was about forty, short, and chubby, with thinning brown hair and thick 
black eyeglasses perched on his round pink face. He wore a yellow sweater that 
made him resemble a ripe pear. 

But Hannah was right. He was very nice. Very friendly. He welcomed me 
eagerly and introduced me to the other sixth graders, and really made me feel at 
home. 

He assigned me a seat near the door in back. Hannah sat in the front row. 

I spotted Sean and Arjun near the windows on the other side of the 
classroom. They nodded, but didn’t say hi or anything. 

They both looked rumpled and kind of tired. Their baggy clothes were very 
wrinkled. Their hair was wild. They look as if they’d been up all night, I 
thought. 

Weird thought... 

After taking attendance and making a few announcements, Mr. Shein sat on 
the edge of his desk. His eyes traveled around the room. He waited for us to 
settle down. 

“Does anyone know what the study of lycanthropy is?” he asked. Behind 
his glasses, his dark eyes glowed. 

I had never heard the word. But to my surprise, several hands shot up. He 
called on Arjun. 

“It’s about people changing into wolves,” Arjun said. 

“Werewolves!” Sean exclaimed. 



Mr. Shein nodded. “Yes. Werewolves,” he repeated. “That’s what 
lycanthropy is the study of.” He cleared his throat. “Since Halloween comes later 
this week, I thought we might spend some time discussing lycanthropy.” 

“There is going to be a full moon on Halloween night this year!” a tall, 
athletic-looking boy interrupted. 

“Yes, there is,” Mr. Shein agreed. “Many people believe a full moon is 
needed to bring the werewolf to life—but they are wrong. Although a 
werewolf’s powers do grow stronger as the moon grows fuller.” 

Crossing his legs, he leaned back and began to talk. He explained how the 
werewolf legends began over two hundred years ago in Europe. A normal 
person, bitten by a werewolf, becomes a werewolf himself when moonlight 
shines on him. 

“It is a curse that cannot be removed,” Mr. Shein said, speaking in a low, 
steady voice. Trying to sound spooky. “No matter how much he tries to live a 
normal life, a man inflicted with the curse turns into a wolf under the light of the 
moon.” 

“Girls too?” Hannah asked. 

Some kids giggled. 

“Yes. Girls too,” the teacher answered seriously. 

“The werewolf must rage and howl,” Mr. Shein continued. “And prowl the 
woods or forest in search of victims.” 

“Cool!” a red-haired boy in front of me muttered. 

Everyone laughed. 

“At daybreak, the werewolves must shed their wolf skin,” the teacher 
explained. “They return to human form. They must hide their wolf skin until the 
next night. They must hide the skin in a safe place. Because if someone takes the 
werewolf’s skin and burns it... the werewolf will die.” 

“Cool!” the red-haired boy repeated. 

More laughter. Kids started talking excitedly. 

It took a while for Mr. Shein to quiet everyone. He jumped to his feet, 
pulled down his yellow sweater, and paced in front of the chalkboard. 

“Does anyone in this class believe that werewolves really exist?” he asked. 

I snickered. I didn’t think any kids would raise their hands. 

But to my surprise, every single hand in the room shot up. 

“You all believe in werewolves!” Mr. Shein declared. 

“Yes, we do,” I heard Arjun murmur softly. 



“Yes, we do,” Sean repeated. 

I turned and realized they were both staring hard at me. 

I felt a sudden chill. What is their problem? I wondered. Why are they 
acting so weird? 



16 


After school, Sean and Arjun came up to me at the back of the classroom. 
Outside the room, lockers slammed. The tile walls echoed with shouts and 
laughter. 

The two guys studied me solemnly. “What’s up?” I greeted them, zipping 
my backpack. 

Mr. Shein waved and walked out, carrying a bulging briefcase. The three of 
us were alone in the room. 

“How’s it going?” Sean asked. 

“Is it weird being in a new school?” Arjun said. 

“Yeah. Kind of,” I told them. “Especially since I know I’m only here for a 
few weeks.” 

“You’re lucky!” Arjun joked. “Sean and I are stuck here.” 

“Wolf Creek isn’t so bad,” I said. I swung the backpack onto my shoulder. 

The two boys stared at me intently. They didn’t say anything. Sean shoved 
his hands into his baggy jeans pockets. Arjun fiddled with a silver ring on his 
little finger. 

Finally, Sean broke the silence. “You don’t believe in werewolves,” he said 
softly. 

“Huh? Well...” I hesitated. 

“You didn’t raise your hand,” Arjun added. “Everyone else did.” 

“Yeah. I know,” I replied. “I really don’t believe in them. I mean, come on, 
guys. It’s practically the twenty-first century. See a lot of guys with fur on their 
faces walking around the streets? I don’t think so!” 

I meant it to be funny. But they didn’t laugh. They kept staring at me with 
their solemn faces. 

“Werewolves exist,” Arjun said softly. “We can prove it to you.” 

“For sure,” I replied sarcastically, rolling my eyes. “The Easter Bunny 
exists too. I saw him riding a bus back home in Cleveland.” 

“We can prove it to you, Alex,” Arjun insisted. “We can show you a 
werewolf.” 

“A real one,” Sean added. 

“No, thanks,” I said. “I really—” 



“You can take pictures of it,” Arjun interrupted. 

“Yeah. You can take a whole roll!” his friend cried. 

That made me stop and think. I remembered the photo contest I planned to 
enter. I needed a Halloween photo—a really good Halloween photo—for the 
contest. 

They moved closer, surrounding me, forcing me to back up until I bumped 
into the windowsill. 

“Want to see a real werewolf, Alex?” Sean demanded. 

“Want to take photos of a real werewolf?” Arjun asked. 

They stared hard at me, challenging me. 

“What do I have to do?” I asked. 



17 


Aunt Marta laughed. “Hannah—you look dreadful !” she cried, pressing her 
hands against her cheeks. 

“Thank you!” Hannah took a low bow. “Thank you!” 

After dinner, Hannah had come over to show off her Halloween costume. 
She changed her mind about dressing as a pirate. The costume she chose instead 
was hard to describe. She had taken a lot of old clothes, torn them all up, and 
sewn them back together. 

Her baggy pants had one brown leg and one green leg. And they had 
checkered patches at the knees. She wore a ragged shirt of yellow, blue, red— 
every color you can imagine. An even more colorful jacket over the shirt. And a 
floppy rag hat that kept falling over her face. 

“What are you supposed to be?” I asked. “A junkyard?” 

She didn’t laugh. “I’m a rag doll,” she replied. “Don’t you get it?” She 
tugged at the jacket. “Rags?” 

Aunt Marta and Uncle Colin both laughed. I was happy to see them 
enjoying themselves. They had both seemed tired and low at dinner. They had 
barely spoken to me. 

“There used to be a song about a rag doll,” Aunt Marta said. “Remember it, 
Colin?” 

My uncle shook his head. “I don’t remember anything anymore,” he 
replied. “I’m lucky if I remember to get up in the morning!” 

“Oh, give me a break, Colin!” Aunt Marta scolded. She gave him a playful 
shove. She began singing a song about a rag doll. 

Hannah did a silly dance, twirling her hands above her head. One of her 
jacket sleeves fell off, and we all laughed. 

“Where’s your costume, Alex?” my aunt demanded. “Go put it on. Come 
on. Let’s have a preview.” 

“I—I haven’t put one together yet,” I stammered. 

“Well, let’s get some old clothes and make you a costume tonight!” Aunt 
Marta insisted. 

“No. I... need to think about it,” I told her. 

I didn’t have my mind on costumes. I kept glancing out the front window at 



the darkening sky. Thinking about what I planned to do later. 

I planned to meet Sean and Arjun in the woods by the creek. At school, 
they told me to take my camera and meet them there. 

They said that the werewolf comes to that spot every night when the moon 
is at the highest point in the sky. “It howls up at the moon,” Arjun said in an 
excited whisper. “And then it lowers its head and laps up water from the creek.” 

“Wait till you see it!” Sean exclaimed. “It’s a man and a wolf at the same 
time. He’s half-human, half-animal.” 

I narrowed my eyes at the two of them. I tried to decide if they were 
goofing or not. Their expressions were so serious—and so excited—I decided 
they were telling the truth. 

Was it possible? Did werewolves really exist? 

I pictured the howling creature in the Marlings’ window. And I pictured the 
two animals in the woods, ripped to pieces. 

By a werewolf? 

The back of my neck tingled. I’d never believed in werewolves. But I’d 
seldom been out of the city. 

Here in this small town surrounded by woods, they began to seem real. 

“Will you meet us at midnight?” Sean asked. 

I didn’t want to return to the woods at night. Not after what I’d seen there. 

But I didn’t want them to know I was afraid. 

And I really needed a great photo to win the contest. A photo of a werewolf 
would definitely win! What else could come close? 

So I agreed to sneak out of the house and meet Sean and Arjun at midnight 
in the woods. But now, as it grew later, I began to feel really nervous about it. 

As I glanced out at the darkness beyond the window, I had a heavy feeling 
in the pit of my stomach. And my hands were suddenly cold and clammy. 

“Alex, what are you thinking about?” Aunt Marta’s voice broke into my 
thoughts. 

“Huh?” I blinked and shook my head. 

Everyone laughed. “You were staring out the window with the strangest 
look on your face,” Hannah declared. 

“Oh. Just watching the moon,” I said with a shrug. 

“It’s Moon Madness!” Uncle Colin joked. “OOOH. Looks like a bad case!” 

“What’s that?” I asked. 

“How should I know?” my uncle replied. “I just made it up!” 



We all laughed again. 

Everyone was in such a good mood. I wished I could relax and have fun 
too. But all I could think about was sneaking out to the woods. 

Hannah went home a short while later. I said goodnight to my aunt and 
uncle and closed myself up in my room. 

I glanced at the bed-table clock. It read ten fifteen. 

Nearly two hours to wait. 

I checked out my camera. Made sure I had it loaded with high-speed film. 

Then I sat down to read a photography magazine—and wait—hoping the 
time would pass quickly. 

My eyes stared at the pages of the magazine. But I couldn’t read. I couldn’t 
concentrate. 

Every few seconds, my eyes went up to the bed-table clock. 

Why does time move so slowly when you’re waiting? 

Finally, at about ten to midnight, I closed my magazine. Pulled on an extra 
sweater and then my jacket. I grabbed my camera case and slung the strap over 
my shoulder. 

Then I tiptoed to the bedroom door. 

My aunt and uncle were probably out in the woods, photographing night 
animals. But in case they decided to stay in tonight, I didn’t want them to hear 
me sneak out. 

I clicked off the lights in my room. Then I reached for the doorknob and 
tugged. 

“Hey—!” 

I turned the knob and tugged again. I turned it the other way and gave the 
door a hard jerk. “I don’t believe it!” I gasped. I’d been locked in. 



18 


The door must be stuck, I decided. 

I tugged it hard. Tugged it a dozen times. I even tried pushing. But I 
couldn’t budge it. It had definitely been locked, locked from the outside. 

I angrily spun away from the door. 

Why did my aunt and uncle lock me in? I wondered. Because of last night? 
Because of my close calls in the woods? 

“They can’t do this to me!” I exclaimed. 

I ran to the window. I jerked the curtains apart and reached for the window 
handles. 

The window slid up a few inches—and I let out a gasp. 

Metal bars had been installed outside. 

When did they put those on? This afternoon? 

I’m a prisoner! I told myself. I’m locked in this room like an animal in a 

cage! 

“They can’t do this to me!” I repeated. “They can’t!” 

I slid the window up all the way. I grabbed the metal bars with both hands 
and struggled to pry them loose. 

But they wouldn’t budge. 

I was still tugging on the bars when I heard a low growl. 

My hands dropped away, and a sharp cry escaped my throat. 

I froze. 

And heard another growl. Louder this time. 

And close. So close. 

A shrill howl rose up. From the Marlings’ house? 

I moved my face up close to the bars and peered out. Their bedroom 
window stood open again. But the house was completely dark. No lights 
anywhere. 

I squinted into the darkness. The moon had disappeared behind a cloud. I 
could barely see across to their house. 

Pressed against the bars, I heard an animal grunt. And then a thud. 

A dark shape dropped down from the Marlings’ open window. Another 



thud. Another shape dropped down on all fours. 

One of the creatures raised its head in a long, mournful howl. 

And then they took off, loping heavily toward the backyard, heading to the 
woods. 

Dogs? Wolves? Humans? 

I couldn’t see clearly in the darkness. 

I stared out, and a silvery light washed over the house as the cloud drifted 
away from the moon. 

But now it was too late. Too late. 

The creatures had vanished. 

I pounded the bars with my fists. 

Sean and Arjun were waiting for me by the creek. And there was no way I 
could get there. 

What would they think? That I was a total chicken? A wimp? 

I’m missing my big chance to take a winning photograph! I realized. 

Angrily, I slammed the window shut. 

“Tomorrow night!” I declared out loud. “Tomorrow night I’m getting out of 
here. My aunt and uncle won’t stop me. 

“Tomorrow night I’m going into the woods, and I’m going to find out the 
truth about werewolves!” 



19 


“How could you do that to me?” I shrieked. I burst into the kitchen for breakfast 
the next morning, and strode angrily up to my aunt and uncle. 

“How could you lock me in my room without telling me?” I cried. 

Aunt Marta set down her coffee mug. She gazed up at me with a troubled 
expression. Then she turned to Uncle Colin. “Maybe we should have told Alex,” 
she said. 

Uncle Colin narrowed his eyes at me. “Did you try to get out last night, 
Alex?” 

“Well...” I hesitated. I didn’t want to tell them what I had planned to do. “I 
don’t like being in a cage!” I protested. “I’m twelve years old, and I really think 

“We’re sorry,” Aunt Marta interrupted. She glanced at the kitchen clock and 
poured me out a bowl of cornflakes. 

“But we did it for your own good,” Uncle Colin added. He folded his 
napkin tensely between his hands. “We had no choice. We can’t let you go 
running out to the woods the way you did your first night. It just isn’t safe.” 

“We’re responsible for you,” Aunt Marta said, pushing the cereal bowl 
across the table to me. “We promised your parents we’d return you safe and 
sound. We don’t want to lock you in, Alex. But we have to make sure—” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

“Besides, the Marlings called the police yesterday,” Uncle Colin said, 
frowning. 

“They what?” I cried. “They called the police—about me?” 

He nodded. “They complained about you spying on them,” he said. 

I let out an angry scream. “That’s totally stupid!” I cried. “I didn’t spy on 
them! I didn’t do anything to them!” 

“Okay, okay.” Aunt Marta came around the table and placed a comforting 
hand on my shoulder. “Don’t worry about the Marlings. Just don’t go anywhere 
near their house—okay?” 

I turned to her. “Are they werewolves?” I blurted out. 

Uncle Colin gasped. 

Aunt Marta uttered a short laugh. “Is that what Hannah told you?” she 



demanded. 

“Well... yes,” I replied. 

She shook her head. “Hannah has a twisted sense of humor,” she said. 

“The Marlings are just very odd, very unfriendly people,” Unde Colin told 
me. He glanced out the kitchen window toward their house. And added: “Two 
unfriendly people with two very unfriendly dogs.” 

“Hannah said they don’t have any dogs,” I insisted. 

Uncle Colin made a disgusted face. “Tell your friend Hannah to stop pulling 
your leg.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“She’s trying to scare you, Alex. Don’t listen to her.” 

The doorbell rang. Hannah had arrived to walk me to school. 

I was happy to get out of the house. I still felt angry about being locked up. 

As we walked to school, I didn’t tell Hannah about it. I knew she’d 
probably think it was funny. And she’d tell other kids about how my aunt and 
uncle were so worried about me, they locked me in like a baby. 

I didn’t mention the Marlings’ dogs, either. I didn’t want to get into another 
argument about werewolves. I wanted to find out the truth for myself. 

At school, I hung my jacket in my locker and started to Mr. Shein’s class. 
But as I turned the corner, Sean and Arjun stepped up to block my path. 

They’d been waiting for me. They moved quickly to back me against the 
wall. Their eyes glowed with excitement. 

“Hey, Alex.” Sean poked me in the shoulder. 

“Seen any werewolves lately?” Arjun demanded. 



20 


“Uh... well..I didn’t know what to say. “You see... my aunt and uncle...” 

Why were they staring at me like that? Were they trying to scare me? 

A strange grin spread over Sean’s face. “Have a good time in the woods last 
night?” he asked. 

“Yeah. How was it?” Arjun demanded. “Catch any werewolves, Alex?” 

I bumped them off me and stepped away from the wall. “You mean you 
weren’t there?” I cried. 

They both burst out laughing. They slapped each other a high five. 

“Of course not!” Arjun declared. “Why would we go into the woods in the 
middle of the night?” 

“I was sound asleep by midnight,” Sean said, grinning. 

They laughed and congratulated each other again. 

A joke. The whole thing had been a joke. They didn’t wait for me in the 
woods at midnight. They never intended to go to the woods. 

“So how was it?” Sean asked. “Were you surprised when Arjun and I didn’t 
show up?” 

“No. I didn’t even think of you,” I told them. “Do you know why? Because 
I was too busy taking photos of the werewolf!” 

“Huh?” Sean cried. 

It was their turn to be surprised. 

Of course I was lying. But they had no way of knowing that I hadn’t gone 
to the woods, either. 

“What did you see?” Arjun asked suspiciously. 

“I followed a werewolf,” I told him, forcing myself not to crack a smile. 
“He came to the creek and he drank, just as you said.” 

“Give me a break,” Sean groaned. 

“Yeah. Really!” Arjun rolled his eyes. “In your dreams.” 

“I can prove it. I took a whole roll of film,” I told them. 

“Let’s see the pictures,” Sean demanded. 

“I haven’t developed them yet,” I replied. 

They stared at me, trying to decide if I was telling the truth. I felt a laugh 



about to explode inside me. But somehow I kept a straight face. 

The bell rang. 

“We’re late!” Arjun cried. 

The three of us bolted down the hall to the room. We dove into our seats 
two seconds before Mr. Shein walked in. 

Don’t ask me what we talked about all morning. I didn’t hear a word. 

I was thinking hard, thinking about Sean and Arjun. What was I going to 
tell them tomorrow when they asked to see the werewolf photos? 

Would I have to confess that I lied to them? 

No, I decided. I had a better plan. 

“I’m going to sneak out tonight and take pictures of the Marlings’ house,” I 
whispered into the phone. 

“Huh? Alex? Why are you whispering?” Hannah’s voice rang shrilly in my 
ear. 

I was whispering because my aunt and uncle had only one telephone. An 
old-fashioned black phone set on a table in the living room. And the two of them 
were in the next room preparing dinner. I could see them from the armchair I 
slumped in. 

“Hannah, I’m going to hide at the side of the house,” I whispered. “And I’m 
going to snap some pictures of whoever—or whatever—jumps out of that 
bedroom window tonight.” 

“Do you have a sore throat or something?” Hannah demanded. “I can’t hear 
you, Alex.” 

I opened my mouth to repeat what I’d said—but Aunt Marta entered the 
room. “Dinner is ready, Alex. Who are you talking to?” she asked. 

“Hannah,” I told my aunt. “I’ve got to go,” I said into the phone. “Talk to 
you later.” I hung up the receiver. 

I hoped that maybe Hannah might want to sneak out at midnight and keep 
me company. I’ll have to ask her later, I decided. 

Yawning, pretending to be very sleepy, I went to my room a little after ten 
o’clock. A few minutes later, I heard the lock click outside my door. My aunt or 
uncle had locked me in again. 

But this time, I fooled them. This time, I was prepared. 

Before dinner, I’d jammed a wad of bubblegum into the latch. The door 



wasn’t really closed. 

Once again, I pulled on an extra sweater. And checked out my camera. And 
waited, gazing at the bed-table clock. 

Just before midnight, I swung the camera case over my shoulder. Slid the 
bedroom door open easily. And crept out of the house, under the white light of 
the moon, ready to solve the mystery of the Marlings. 



21 


I cast a quick glance at the Mailings’ house. Then I turned away and trotted 
across the wet grass to Hannah’s house. 

No lights were on. The storm door in back hadn’t been shut. The wind 
made it swing open, as if inviting me in. 

But I made my way up to Hannah’s bedroom window on the other side of 
the house. Silver moonlight washed over the glass, making it reflect the trees 
like a mirror. 

I couldn’t see inside. But the window was open a few inches. 

“Hannah—?” I called in a loud whisper. “Hannah—are you awake?” 

I heard someone stirring inside. The curtains shifted. “Who’s there?” 
Hannah called out sleepily. 

“It’s me!” I whispered, standing on tiptoe. “It’s Alex. Come to the window.” 

“Alex? What are you doing out there?” she demanded. 

“I’m going to take photos of the Marlings,” I told her. “Come out with me, 
Hannah.” 

“Huh? Photos?” she called out. “But it’s so late, Alex. I was asleep, and—” 

“Every night I hear howls from their house,” I told her. “And then someone 
—or something—jumps out of their bedroom window and runs into the woods. 
My uncle says it’s their dogs, but—” 

“I told you,” she interrupted. “The Marlings don’t have dogs. They’re 
werewolves. I know you don’t believe me. But it’s true. Your aunt and uncle 
know it’s true. But they don’t want you to be scared.” 

“That’s why I want to take photos,” I explained. “I mean, I could be the first 
person in the world to get a werewolf on film! Get dressed, Hannah. Come on!” 
I pleaded. “I want you to see too.” 

“You’re crazy, Alex! Get back in the house!” Hannah warned. She appeared 
at the window. She pulled it up higher and leaned out. 

“I’m not coming out there,” she insisted. “It’s too dangerous. You told me 
about those two animals you saw. They were ripped to shreds—right? If the 
Marlings see you, they’ll do the same thing to you!” 

Her words sent a cold shiver down the back of my neck. But I was 
desperate to solve the mystery—and to snap a great photo. 



“They won’t see us!” I told her. “We’ll hide behind the bushes at the side of 
the house.” 

“Don’t say us,” Hannah called out. “I’m not doing it, Alex. I’m too scared. 
I’m warning you, go back inside.” 

“Please!” I pleaded. I grabbed her arm. “Come on out, Hannah. You want to 
see the werewolves too—don’t you?” 

“No way!” She jerked her arm away. “Go home, Alex,” she repeated. “It’s 
not a game. It’s really dangerous.” 

“Listen, Hannah—” I started. 

But she slid the window shut. 

I stared at the reflection of the trees in the glass. Maybe she’s right, I 
thought. Another cold shiver ran down my back. Maybe this is a big mistake. 
Maybe it is too dangerous. If the Marlings catch me... 

I gasped when I heard a low growl. 

I froze. 

I didn’t have to turn around. I knew from the sound. 

A werewolf—it had sneaked up behind me. 



22 


Another low grunt made me cry out. 

My knees started to collapse. I took a deep, shivering breath and spun 
around to face the creature. 

No. 

Not there. 

No one there. 

I swallowed. Swallowed again. My mouth suddenly felt bone-dry. 

Another growl. I realized where it came from. From the back of the 
Marlings’ house. 

They’re about to jump out the window, I told myself. Those are the sounds I 
hear every night just before they climb out the bedroom window. 

And I’m standing out here in the open. I’ll be the first thing they see! 

My legs didn’t want to work. But I gritted my teeth, took a deep breath— 
and forced myself to move. 

My sneakers slid on the wet grass. I slipped, but I didn’t fall. 

I scrambled to the bushes that divided my aunt and uncle’s house from the 
Marlings’ house. 

I dropped to my knees, panting noisily. My heart pounded so hard, my chest 

hurt. 

I ducked my head. And grabbed for the straps on my camera case. 

A high, shrill animal howl floated out from the Marlings’ open bedroom 
window. The light of the moon made the side of their house gleam. 

The yard was nearly as bright as day. Everything glistened from the frosty 

dew. 

Ducking low behind the bushes, I could see every leaf, every dew-covered 
blade of grass. 

I tugged at the zipper of my camera case. I knew I had to pull the camera 
out—fast. But my hands were shaking so bad, I couldn’t budge the zipper. 
Another howl made me turn back to the window. 

A shadow moved. 

A leg slid out. 



Another leg. 

A slender form dropped to the ground. 

It all happened so quickly. As if time had been put on fast-forward. 

My eyes on the window, I struggled to unzip the camera case. 

Another body crawled out from the darkness of the Marlings’ bedroom 
window. 

Two forms stood on the ground and stretched. 

Two humans ! 

Not wolves. 

Humans. 

What were they wearing? 

Capes? 

Dark fur capes, draped over their shoulders, hanging heavily behind them. 

They had their backs to me. I couldn’t see their faces. 

Hands on their waists, they stretched, bending back, bending from side to 
side, as if limbering up their muscles for a long jog. 

And then they raised their heads to the moon—and howled. 

Turn around! I pleaded silently, trembling behind the bushes. Please turn 
around! I want to see your faces! 

“Ohhhh...” I uttered a startled moan as their fur capes began to move. The 
heavy capes began to curl around them, to tighten around their bodies. 

And I realized they weren’t capes. They were some kind of animal skins. 

Furry skins. With arms. And legs... 

The dark skins wrapped themselves tightly over the two humans. The fur 
spread over their bodies, slid over their heads, covered their legs, their arms, 
their hands. 

“Ohhhhh...” I shook so hard, I let go of the camera case and hugged 
myself. Hugged myself tight, trying to hold myself in, trying to keep myself 
together. 

The two figures howled again, raising their furry arms over their heads. 
Silvery claws slid out from their paws. 

The two creatures raked the claws at each other playfully, pretending to 
attack. Growling and grunting, they lowered themselves to all fours. 

No longer humans. 

Animals... wolf creatures... 

Hannah is right, I realized. She told the truth. The Marlings are 



werewolves. They turned into wolves under the moonlight. 

Gasping for breath, I snatched up the camera case. I fumbled once again 
with the zipper. Finally managed to pull it open. 

And they turned. They both turned toward me. 

Two wolves ! 

Their dark eyes stared out from beneath fur-covered foreheads. Their furry 
snouts snapped open to reveal rows of curled animal teeth. 

Werewolves. The Marlings were werewolves. Human and wolf at the same 

time! 

The werewolves nuzzled each other, growling softly. I raised the camera. I 
pulled myself up to my knees. 

I’ve got to snap a picture. Do it now, Alex! I ordered myself. 

But my hands shook so badly, I wasn’t sure I could hold the camera steady 
enough. 

Do it! Do it! 

I raised the viewfinder to my eye. I stood up a little higher to see over the 
top of the bush. 

“Ohhh.” As I raised myself, a sharp twig scraped the side of my face. 

And I dropped the camera! 

It landed on the grass with a THUD. 

The two wolf creatures turned. 

And saw me! 



23 


I sank to the ground. Pressed myself flat on my stomach. 

My chest heaved. I breathed through my mouth, struggling to keep 
perfectly still, perfectly silent. 

Did they see me? Did they? 

I raised my head enough to peer out at them beneath the bottom branch of 
the bush. 

They had their fur-covered snouts raised. They sniffed the air. 

Did they smell me? Did they know I was hiding down here? 

Were they about to leap into the bush and rip me apart with those long, 
silvery claws? 

I held my breath, squinting across the grass at them. 

They sniffed some more, grunting softly. 

Then they turned away. Dropped to all fours. And loped off, heading to the 
woods. 

I waited until I could no longer hear the soft thud of their paws or their low 
growls and grunts. Then I slid forward on my stomach, reached out, and grabbed 
my camera. 

My camera! 

I hadn’t snapped any photos. Not a single shot. 

I climbed shakily to my feet and rubbed the wet dew from the lens. Then I 
raised my eyes to the woods. 

I have to follow them, I decided. 

I have to take some photos. This is the chance of a lifetime! 

If I can take the first-ever shots of actual werewolves, I’ll be famous! I 
pictured myself in newspapers and on magazine covers. I imagined my photos of 
the Marlings on display in fancy photo galleries. 

And I thought of how proud of me Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta would be. 

That thought sent a chill down my back. Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta— 
they were working in the woods right now. Busy photographing animals of the 
night. 

Did they know that two werewolves were on the loose? Did they know that 
two werewolves were prowling the woods, searching for victims? 



They’re not safe out there, I realized. 

Of course, following the werewolves into the woods was crazy—and 
dangerous. But now I had two reasons to chase after them. 

I had to snap some pictures —and warn my aunt and uncle. 

My eyes on the woods, I jammed the camera into the case and slung it over 
my shoulder. Then I began trotting across the backyard toward the trees, 
following the fresh paw prints in the frosty grass. 

I ducked into the trees and followed the curving path. Moonlight trickled 
through the treetop leaves, making eerie, shifting patterns on the ground. 

I didn’t have to go far to catch up with the two werewolves. Just past the 
bent, old-man tree, I heard an animal grunt. And then a shrill cry of attack. 

I stopped—and peered through a low evergreen shrub. Mouths gaping open, 
claws raised, the two wolf creatures leaped. 

They’ve caught someone! I realized, frozen in horror. 

Who is it? My aunt? My uncle? 



24 


The two werewolves wrestled with their prey. 

I heard a shrill bleat of pain. Then I saw four hooves shoot up in the air. 

Not a human, I realized, squinting into the dim light. They’ve trapped a 
deer. A baby deer. 

They’re going to kill it. 

They’re going to tear it to shreds. 

What can I do? I asked myself. How can I save it? 

I didn’t think. I was too terrified to think clearly. 

I tossed back my head. And I let out a loud wolf howl. 

My cry echoed off the trees. 

The snarling werewolves stopped their attack. They raised their heads. 

They turned toward my cry. 

Just long enough for the fawn to scramble to its feet. It shook itself—like a 
dog after a bath—and took off into the trees. 

The werewolves sniffed the air furiously. They didn’t seem to notice that 
the fawn had escaped. Their eyes glowed red in the pale moonlight. They turned, 
uttering low, angry growls. Lowered their heads. And came charging at me. 



25 


I staggered back. 

Too frightened to move. 

No time to run. 

The ground seemed to shake under the thunder of the wolves’ paws. 

I opened my mouth to scream—but no sound came out. 

The wolves’ jaws snapped. Their red eyes glowed as if on fire. 

I raised my arms in front of me, as if to shield myself. 

Prepared for the attack. 

And the wolves turned away. Turned sharply to the right, running together. 
A scrawny brown rabbit scrambled over the path. 

The wolves had turned away from me to chase the rabbit! 

Snarling furiously, they lowered their heads—and caught the rabbit easily. 
The little creature didn’t put up much of a fight. 

One wolf snapped its neck. The other bit hungrily into its belly. 

Breathing hard, I swung my camera case around. And pulled the camera out 
with a quick jerk. 

My hand trembled as I raised the viewfinder to my eye. But I steadied the 
camera with both hands. 

And clicked off a shot. 

And then another. 

I snapped a shot of the wolves tugging the rabbit apart. And another shot of 
the two of them eating side by side. 

When the wolves finished, nothing remained of the rabbit. Licking their 
teeth, they turned and loped off into the trees. 

Holding my camera in front of me with both hands, I followed after them. 

I guess I was in some kind of shock. I know I wasn’t thinking clearly. 

I was barely thinking at all! 

I had nearly been caught by the two werewolves. They would have finished 
me the way they’d finished that poor rabbit. 

But I knew I had to follow them. I had to stay in the woods. 

I had to warn my aunt and uncle. I had to find them and tell them they were 



wrong about the Marlings. That Hannah told the truth. 

I had to let them know the danger they were in. 

And I had to take more photographs. 

I’d been through such a horrible scare. My heart pounded, and my arms and 
legs felt all trembly and weak. I didn’t feel like me. I felt as if I were outside 
myself, watching myself. 

But I knew I couldn’t run back to the house. Not until my aunt and uncle 
were safe. 

I kept pretty far behind the creatures, far enough that I could slip behind a 
tree or bush if one of them glanced back. And I kept my camera raised, ready to 
snap off shots. 

They loped slowly to the creek. I watched them lower their heads and 
noisily lap up water. 

They didn’t look at all human now. Their bodies had become wolf bodies. I 
couldn’t see anything human in their faces. Their glowing eyes were animal 
eyes. 

They took a long drink from the creek, washing down their dinner, I guess. 
I steadied my camera and clicked off several shots. 

I wished Hannah had come with me. I wanted someone else to be there with 
me, to see what I was seeing. 

I couldn’t wait to get back and tell her that she was right about the 
Marlings. That they really were werewolves. 

The two wolf creatures suddenly raised their heads from the water, turned, 
and sniffed the air. 

Did they smell me? Or some other prey? 

I slid behind a fat tree trunk and held my breath. 

When I carefully peered out, they were loping along the creek shore. I 
waited until they had gone a short distance, then I crept out and followed them. 

I followed the two werewolves all night. I finished one roll of film, then 
popped in another. I shot them rising up on their furry hind legs and howling at 
the moon. And I clicked off several more horrifying shots of them devouring 
small animals. 

And I searched for my aunt and uncle. Desperate to warn them, to tell them 
what I had learned. 

As I trailed behind the creatures—so frightened and excited—I completely 
lost track of time. It was as if I were walking through a dream. None of it 



seemed real. 

Finally, a red crack of sunlight appeared along the ground. To my shock, it 
was nearly daybreak. 

The werewolves moved slowly now. Their loping trot had become a stiff¬ 
legged walk. 

As they stepped out of the trees into their backyard, they rose up onto their 
hind legs. They staggered awkwardly to the back of their house. 

I stayed by the trees, afraid to go too close. The sky was brightening as the 
sun made its way higher. If the wolf creatures turned around, they could see me 
easily. 

I raised my camera. I had only a few shots left. 

The two werewolves staggered on two legs to the side of their house. They 
stretched their furry forearms and raised their faces to the brightening sun. 

“Oh!” I couldn’t help it. I uttered a shocked cry as they began to shed their 
skins. 

The fur appeared to peel back. 

The claws slid out of view. And the fur pulled back, revealing their human 
hands. 

As I gaped in amazement, the black wolf fur peeled off their arms and legs, 
then slid off their bodies. 

They had their backs to me. 

The fur skins settled into capes again. The two humans reached up and 
pulled off the heavy capes. 

I’m going to see the Marlings for the first time! I realized. 

They lowered the wolf skin capes to the ground. 

They turned slowly. 

And I saw their faces. 



26 


As the morning sunlight washed over their faces, I nearly cried out—in horror 
and disbelief. 

Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta stretched, brushed back their silvery hair, then 
bent to pick up their wolf skins. 

My aunt and uncle —they were the werewolves! 

Uncle Colin raised his eyes to the woods. I fell back behind a tree. Did he 
see me? 

No. 

My whole body trembled. I wanted to cry out: “No! No! This can’t be 
happening!” 

But I pressed myself against the tree and kept my jaws clamped tight. I 
couldn’t let them see me. I couldn’t let them know that I knew the truth. 

The smooth tree trunk felt cool against my forehead. I had to think. I had to 
make a plan. 

What should I do? I knew I couldn’t stay with them any longer. I couldn’t 
live in a house with two werewolves. 

But where could I go? Who would help me? 

Who would believe me? 

I watched my aunt and uncle fold up their wolf skins. Then Uncle Colin 
helped Aunt Marta climb into the Marlings’ bedroom window. Once she was 
inside, he followed her in. 

“The Marlings!” I murmured to myself. Were they okay in there? Or did my 
aunt and uncle do something terrible to them? 

A few minutes later, Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta climbed back out of the 
window. Then they scurried across the driveway, into their own house. 

I clung to the tree trunk for a while, watching the two houses. Thinking 

hard. 

Were the Marlings asleep in their house? Did they know that the two 
werewolves were in there? Were the Marlings werewolves too? 

I wanted to run away. To make my way to the street and just keep running 
until I was miles and miles away. 

But I had to find out about the Marlings. I couldn’t leave without finding 



out the truth about them. 

So I watched the two houses for a while longer. No sign of anyone moving 
about. 

I pushed myself away from the tree and quickly made my way through the 
Marl mgs’ overgrown backyard. 

I ducked behind bushes and kept my eyes on my aunt and uncle’s house. 
The blinds on their bedroom windows were shut. 

Holding my breath, I darted to the Marlings’ bedroom window. I grabbed 
the windowsill and peered inside. Dark. I couldn’t see anything. 

“Here goes,” I murmured softly. “Good luck, Alex.” 

I lifted myself up onto the sill, then lowered my legs into the room. It took a 
few seconds for my eyes to adjust to the dim light. 

And then what I saw shocked me nearly as much as learning that my aunt 
and uncle were werewolves. 

I saw nothing. 

The bedroom was completely bare. Not a stick of furniture. No artwork or 
mirrors on the wall. No carpet over the dust-covered floorboards. 

Turning to the bedroom door, I spotted the two wolf skins. They were 
neatly folded and piled side by side in front of the closet. 

Taking a deep breath, I moved cautiously to the open doorway. I poked my 
head out into the hall. Also unlit and bare. 

“Anyone home?” I choked out in a tiny voice. “Hello? Anyone home?” 

Silence. 

I crept down the hall toward the front of the house. I peered into each room. 

They were all bare and empty, covered with a thick layer of dust. 

I stepped into the middle of the living room. No furniture. No lights. No 
sign that anyone had lived here in years! 

“Oh, wow!” I cried out as I realized the tmth. My voice echoed off the bare 
walls. 

No one lives here, I told myself. There are no Marlings! 

My aunt and uncle had made them up. They used this house to hide their 
wolf skins. They’d made up the Marlings to keep people out of the house. 

No Marlings. No Marlings. No Marlings. 

It was all a lie! 

I have to warn Hannah, I decided. No one is safe around here. 

I pictured my aunt and uncle devouring that helpless little rabbit last night. I 



pictured them wrestling with that baby deer. 

I have to tell Hannah and her family, I decided. And then we have to run 
away from here—as far as we can. 

I turned and made my way quickly through the empty house. Then I 
lowered myself out the bedroom window into the backyard. 

The morning sun was still a red ball, low over the treetops. The early dew 
glistened over the grass. 

“Hannah, I hope you’re awake,” I murmured. “If not, I’ll have to wake you 

up.” 

I turned away from the Marlings’ window and began to run across the back 
toward Hannah’s house. 

I went about six or seven steps. Then I stopped with a gasp as Aunt Marta’s 
voice rang out behind me. “Alex—what on earth are you doing out there?” 



27 


I spun around. My knees nearly collapsed. The ground tilted up, then down. 

Aunt Marta stood in the kitchen doorway. “Alex—why are you up so early? 
It’s Saturday morning.” She narrowed her eyes at me suspiciously. 

“I—well...” I was shaking so hard, I couldn’t speak! 

“Where are you going in such a hurry?” my aunt demanded. I saw Uncle 
Colin standing behind her in the kitchen. 

“To... Hannah’s,” I managed to reply. “To talk about... uh... our costumes 
for trick-or-treating tonight.” 

I watched her face. Did she believe me? 

I didn’t think so. 

“It’s too early to be running over to Hannah’s,” she scolded. She motioned 
for me to come inside. “Come in, Alex. Come get some breakfast first.” 

I hesitated. My mind whirred. 

Should I make a run for it? Run to the street and keep going? 

How far would I get before they caught me? My aunt and uncle were both 
werewolves. If they caught me—what would they do to me? Would I be their 
breakfast? 

No. I decided not to run. Not just yet, anyway. Not until I had a chance to 
talk to Hannah. 

I felt Aunt Marta’s eyes on me as I made my way slowly into the house. 
Uncle Colin muttered good morning. He stared hard at me too. “Early start, 
huh?” he asked softly. 

I nodded and took my place at the breakfast table. 

“Marta and I worked all night,” Uncle Colin reported. He yawned. “We 
took some pretty good shots.” 

That’s a lie! I wanted to shout. I followed you. I saw what you did. I know 
what you are! 

But I didn’t say anything. Just stared down at my cereal bowl. 

I’m having breakfast with two werewolves! I thought, feeling my stomach 
churn. My aunt and uncle run through the woods at night, murdering and ripping 
animals apart. 

I can’t sit here another minute! I told myself. I started to get up. 



But I felt Uncle Colin’s hand on my shoulder. “Relax, Alex. Have a nice 
breakfast,” he said softly. 

“But, I—” I didn’t know what to say. I was too terrified to eat. I wanted him 
to take his hand off me. It was making my whole body tremble. 

“It’s Halloween,” Uncle Colin said. “You’ll be out late tonight.” 

“Have a good breakfast,” Aunt Marta chimed in. 

They watched me as I choked down my cornflakes. They didn’t smile. They 
were studying me coldly. 

They know that I followed them, I decided. They know that I know their 
secret. 

They’re not going to let me get away. 

“Uh... I have to go to Hannah’s now,” I said, struggling to sound calm and 
cheerful. I slid my chair back and started to stand up. 

But I felt Uncle Colin’s hand grip my shoulder again. He grasped me tightly 
and held on. 

“Alex, come with me,” he ordered. 



28 


He kept his hand clamped tightly on my shoulder as he led me to the back of the 
garage. He walked quickly and didn’t say a word. 

I wondered if I could break out of his grip and make a run for it. How far 
would I get? 

He let go of my shoulder. What did he plan to do? 

“I’m sorry I followed you,” I said in a choked whisper. “I—I won’t tell 
anyone what I saw.” 

He hadn’t heard me. He had moved to the corner of the garage and picked 
up a long-handled tool. 

He shoved it toward me. “I need your help this morning,” he said. “There’s 
a lot of yard work to be done.” 

I swallowed. “Yard work?” 

Uncle Colin nodded. “That’s a weed whacker. Have you ever used one 
before?” 

“No. Not really,” I confessed. The handle shook in my hand. 

“It’s pretty easy,” he said. “I need you to cut down all these weeds behind 
the garage.” 

“Yeah. Okay,” I replied, feeling dazed. 

“And be careful not to toss any weeds in the Marlings’ yard,” he warned. 
“I’m sure they’ll be watching your every move. Waiting to complain to us about 
you.” 

“No problem,” I replied. 

There are no Marlings! I wanted to scream. 

“I’ll work with you,” Uncle Colin said, wiping sweat off his forehead with 
the back of his hand. “Together we can teach these weeds a lesson they’ll never 
forget.” He grinned for the first time that morning. 

Does he know that I know? I wondered. Is that why he’s keeping me here 
this morning? 

My uncle and I worked in the yard all day. Whenever I would take a short break, 
I’d catch him watching me coldly, studying me. 

I was so frightened. I wanted to drop my tools and run. 



But I couldn’t leave without warning Hannah and her family. They had to 
know that they were in danger too. 

I didn’t see Hannah until after dinner. She burst in just as we were finishing. 

“Well? How do I look?” she demanded. She did a fast twirl in her rag-doll 
costume. 

“You look wonderful!” Aunt Marta gushed. 

Hannah frowned at me. “Alex, where’s your costume? Come on. You’re not 
ready to trick-or-treat?” 

“Uh... it’s upstairs,” I told her. “It won’t take me long to get it together. 
Uh... come help me—okay?” 

I practically pulled her all the way to my room. 

“It’s a great night out,” she said. “Perfect for trick-or-treating. The night of 
the full moon.” 

I tugged her into the room and shut the door behind us. “We’ve got a 
problem,” I told her. 

She fiddled with the rag hat that flopped down over her forehead. 
“Problem?” 

“Yeah. Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta are werewolves.” 

“Huh?” Her eyes bulged. “What did you say?” 

I explained everything. Speaking rapidly in a low whisper, I told her all that 
I’d seen last night. “They hide their wolfskins in the Marlings’ house,” I 
finished. 

“But the Marlings—?” Hannah started. 

“There are no Marlings!” I cried. “The house is empty. My aunt and uncle 
use it as a hiding place for their wolf skins.” 

Hannah stared at me openmouthed for a long time. Her chin trembled. 
“But... what are we going to do?” she cried breathlessly. “Your aunt and uncle— 
they seem like such nice people. They’ve always been so nice to me.” 

“They’re werewolves!” I cried. “We have to tell your family. We have to 
hurry away from here. We have to get help. Tell the police or something.” 

“But—but—” Hannah sputtered, her face twisted in panic. 

And suddenly I had another idea. “Wait!” I cried. “Hannah, what did Mr. 
Shein say about werewolves shedding their skin? Didn’t he say that if someone 
finds their skins and burns them, the werewolves will be destroyed?” 

Hannah nodded. “Yes. That’s what he said. But—” 

“So that’s what we’ll do!” I cried excitedly. “We’ll go next door, and—” 



“But you don’t want to kill your aunt and uncle—do you?” Hannah replied. 
“Oh. No. Of course not,” I told her. “I’m so frightened, I’m not thinking 
clearly. I just thought—” 

“Whoa. Wait a minute, Alex!” Hannah cried, grabbing my arm. “I know 
what we can do. I have a plan that might work!” 



29 


I heard my aunt and uncle moving around in the living room. Outside the 
bedroom window, the white full moon was rising behind the trees. Wisps of 
black cloud floated over it like wriggling snakes. 

Hannah tugged me farther into the room. “What if we hide the wolf skins?” 
she asked in an excited whisper. 

“Hide them?” I whispered back. “What will that do?” 

“Your aunt and uncle won’t be able to find them,” Hannah replied. “The 
night will pass. They won’t be able to change into wolves.” 

“So maybe if they go a whole night without the skins, it will cure them!” I 
cried. 

Hannah nodded. “It’s worth a try, Alex. It might just work, and—” She 
stopped. “No. Wait. I have an even better idea. We’ll wear the skins!” 

“Excuse me?” I gasped. “Wear them? Why?” 

“Because your aunt and uncle will search everywhere for the skins,” 
Hannah replied. “They’ll search every house, every garage, every yard. But they 
won’t look for them on us! That’s the last place they’d look!” 

“I get it,” I replied. “And we’ll make sure to stay away so they don’t see us 
until after daybreak.” 

I wasn’t sure whether the plan made any sense or not. Hannah and I were 
both too frightened to think! 

Maybe... just maybe... we could cure Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta by 
keeping the skins from them until morning. 

“Let’s try it,” I said. 

“Okay,” Hannah agreed. “Quick—get into your pirate costume. We don’t 
want your aunt and uncle to suspect anything. While you’re doing that, I’ll sneak 
next door and slip on one of the wolf skins.” 

She pushed me toward the old clothes I had tossed onto the bed. “Hurry. It’s 
getting late. Meet me in back of the garage. I’ll bring out your wolf skin for 
you.” 

Hannah disappeared out the door. I heard her in the living room. She said 
good-bye to Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta and told them she was going to meet 
me outside. 



I heard the front door slam. Hannah was on her way next door to get the 
wolf skins. 

I quickly pulled on the ragged old shirt and torn trousers of my costume. I 
wrapped a bandanna around my head. 

A sound at the bedroom door made me spin around. 

“Aunt Marta!” I cried. 

She stood in the doorway, frowning at me. “It won’t work,” she said, 
shaking her head. 

“Huh?” I gasped. 

“Alex, it won’t work,” she repeated unhappily. 



30 


My aunt moved quickly into the room. 

I couldn’t move. No time to try an escape. 

“It won’t work. That costume won’t work,” Aunt Marta said, shaking her 
head. “You need some makeup. Some black stains on your face. Something to 
make you look less clean!” 

I burst out laughing. I thought Aunt Marta had overheard our plan. But she 
only wanted to improve my pirate costume! 

It took several minutes for my aunt to apply the makeup. Then she searched 
several drawers until she found a gold hoop earring, which she clipped on one 
ear. 

“There. Much better,” she said, grinning. “Now, hurry. Hannah is waiting 
for you.” 

I thanked her and hurried out. Hannah was waiting for me. Behind the 
garage. Already in a wolf skin. 

I gasped when I saw her. It was so strange seeing Hannah’s eyes peering out 
from above a fur-covered snout. 

“What took you so long?” she demanded. Her voice was muffled inside the 
furry wolf head. 

“Aunt Marta,” I replied. “She had to fix up my costume.” I narrowed my 
eyes at Hannah. “How does it feel in there?” 

“Very itchy,” she grumbled. “And hot. Here.” She handed me the other wolf 
skin. “Hurry. Put it on. The moon is already high. Your aunt and uncle will be 
looking for these soon.” 

I took the skin from her. My hand sank into the thick fur. I unfolded it and 
held it up. “Here goes,” I whispered. “I said I wanted to be a werewolf for 
Halloween. Guess I get my wish.” 

“Just hurry!” Hannah urged. “We don’t want them to catch us.” 

I pulled the wolf skin over my head. Down over the old clothes of my 
costume. It felt a little tight. Especially the furry legs. The face fit snugly over 
my face. 

“You’re right. It’s itchy,” I groaned. “It’s so tight. I’m not sure I can walk!” 

“It loosens up after a bit,” Hannah whispered. “Come on. Let’s get away 



from here.” 

She led the way across the backyard. Then we turned and trotted along the 
side of her house and down to the street. 

I heard voices in the next block. Kids shouting, “Trick-or-treat!” 

“We might be safer with other kids,” I suggested. “I mean, if we find a 
whole group and stick with it....” 

“Good idea,” Hannah replied. We crossed the street. 

It was already getting really hot inside my wolf skin. I could feel the sweat 
mnning down my forehead. 

We walked for several blocks. But most of the kids were younger than us. 
We didn’t find anyone good to hang out with. 

We turned a corner and walked several more blocks, into the next 
neighborhood. 

“Hey—look who’s there!” Hannah declared, bumping my arm. 

I followed her gaze and saw a mummy and a robot carrying trick-or-treat 
bags across someone’s front lawn. 

“It’s Sean and Arjun,” Hannah cried. 

“Let’s trick-or-treat with them!” I suggested. I began running across the 
grass, waving my paw at them. “Hey, guys! Hey!” 

They turned and stared at us. 

“Wait up!” I called through my fur-covered snout. 

They screamed. And dropped their bags. And took off, running full speed, 
shrieking for help. 

Hannah and I stopped at the edge of a driveway and watched them run. 
“Think maybe we scared them?” Hannah said, laughing. 

“Maybe a little,” I replied. 

We both laughed. 

But not for long. 

I heard heavy, running footsteps on the pavement behind us. 

I turned—and let out a gasp as my aunt and uncle came mnning furiously 
down the street. 

“There they are!” Uncle Colin cried, pointing at us. “Get them!” 



31 


I froze for a moment, horrified by the sight of my aunt and uncle running toward 
us so furiously, so desperately. 

“Don’t move!” Aunt Marta pleaded. “We need those skins!” 

My legs refused to budge. But then Hannah gave me a hard shove. And we 
both took off. 

We ran wildly, across lawns and empty lots. We cut behind someone’s 
house, then dove through an opening in their tall hedge. 

My aunt and uncle stayed close behind, running full speed, and calling out 
as they ran, “Give us our skins! Give us our skins!” 

Their breathless voices rang in my ears. Their words became an eerie chant. 

“Give us our skins! Give us our skins!” 

We must have run for blocks. It all became a dark blur to me. My heavy 
wolf paws thumped the ground. I struggled to keep my balance. Sweat poured 
down my face inside the heavy fur. 

Another turn. More dark backyards. And then the tilting, tangled trees of 
the woods rose up in front of us. 

Hannah and I dove into the woods, darting between the trees and tall weeds. 
And still my aunt and uncle came after us, chanting, chanting their desperate 
plea: 

“Give us our skins! Give us our skins!” 

We scrambled up a low hill lined with evergreens. Pinecones slid under my 
heavy paws and rolled down the hill. Hannah stumbled and dropped to her 
knees. She scrambled on all fours to the top. 

“Give us our skins! Give us our skins!” 

The cry grew shrill and breathless. 

And then—suddenly—everything seemed to stop. 

As if the whole world had stopped spinning. 

As if even the wind had stopped blowing on top of that little hill. 

I could feel the silence. 

Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta had stopped their chant. 

Panting, Hannah and I turned to face them. 



“The moon—” Hannah whispered breathlessly to me. She pointed. “The 
full moon, Alex. It’s so high. It must be at its peak.” 

And as she whispered those words, my aunt and uncle dropped to their 
knees. They tossed back their heads. As the white light of the moon washed over 
their faces, I saw their pain, their horror. 

They opened their mouths in long, mournful howls. 

Their howls became hideous screams. They tore at their hair with both 
hands. Shut their eyes. And screamed, screamed in agony. 

“Hannah—what have we done?” I cried. 



32 


Tugging at their hair, my aunt and uncle screamed. 

And then, they lowered their hands. And closed their mouths. And a calm 
seemed to sweep over them. 

As Hannah and I stared down at them, Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta helped 
each other to their feet. They brushed each other off. Smoothed down their hair. 

When they finally gazed up at us, I saw tears in their eyes. 

“Thank you,” they both cried. 

“Thank you for saving us!” Uncle Colin exclaimed. 

And then they rushed up the hill to hug us, hug us so joyfully. 

“You freed us from the curse!” Aunt Marta declared, tears running down 
her face. “The moon reached the highest point in the sky, and we didn’t 
transform. Colin and I are no longer werewolves!” 

“How can we ever thank you?” Uncle Colin cried. “You are both so 
wonderful. So brave.” 

“So hot!” I grumbled. “I can’t wait to get out of this itchy skin!” 

Everyone laughed. 

“Let’s go back to our house!” Aunt Marta cried. “We’ll have a real 
celebration!” 

The four of us hurried back to the house. We laughed and joked all the way. 

Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta made their way in through the kitchen door. 
“Homemade doughnuts!” Aunt Marta promised. “And big mugs of hot 
chocolate! How does that sound?” 

“Sounds great!” Hannah and I agreed. 

Hannah started to follow them into the house. But I held her back. 

“Let’s dump the skins next door,” I said. “No one will ever need them 
again. Let’s dump them in the abandoned house.” 

She hesitated. She seemed afraid to go back into that dark, empty house. 

But I went running over to the Marlings’ house. I couldn’t wait to take off 
the hot, smelly wolfskin. 

I pulled myself onto the window ledge, then lowered my legs into the open 
bedroom window. I stepped into the room. Pale moonlight washed over the bare 
floorboards. 



Hannah dropped into the room behind me. “Alex—?” she called. 

I started to tug off the heavy wolf skin. 

But something near the closet caught my eye. 

I stopped and walked over to it. 

A folded-up wolf skin lay on the floor against the wall. 

“Huh?” 

I let out a startled cry. And turned to Hannah. “How can there be a wolf 
skin in here?” I asked. “There were only two of them—right? You put one on, 
and you gave one to me.” 

Hannah stepped up beside me. Her eyes locked on mine. “I didn’t wear the 
one from this house, Alex,” she said softly. “I used my own. I just got it last 
night.” 

“Huh?” I cried. “I don’t get it.” 

“You will,” she whispered. 

She knocked me to the floor with her heavy forepaws, and sank her teeth 
into my chest.

“‘Don’t do that. You’ll poke your eye out.’ That’s what my mom says. No matter 
what I’m doing.” 

I told that to my friend Jeremy Goodman as we trotted to the playground 
behind our school. 

Jeremy laughed. “Your mom really says that, Marco?” 

I nodded and picked up the pace, keeping side by side with Jeremy as we 
crossed Fulton Street. 

“Last night, I had a lot of homework,” I told him. “I took out three new 
pencils and started to sharpen them. My mom came into the room and said, 
‘Don’t do that. You’ll poke your eye out.’” 

Jeremy laughed again. “What does she want you to use? Crayons?” 

I didn’t laugh. It wasn’t funny to me. I’m twelve years old, and my mom 
treats me like some kind of baby. 

She’s always warning me about everything I do. 

“Don’t climb that tree. You’ll break your neck.” 

“Don’t fill the bathtub so full. You’ll drown.” 

“Don’t eat so fast. You’ll choke.” 

She has a warning about everything! I keep expecting her to say, “Marco, 
don’t breathe so much. You’ll break your nose!” 

She drives me crazy. She constantly thinks up new ways I might hurt 
myself or do some kind of damage. 

“Sit up straight or your spine will curve.” 

“Don’t make ugly faces. Your face will freeze, and you’ll always look like 
that.” 

“Don’t pick your nose. Your finger will get stuck.” 

She’s also the world’s expert on germs. According to Mom, everything you 
touch or see will give you germs. 

“Don’t hug the dog. It has germs.” 

“Don’t take a bite of Jeremy’s candy bar. Germs.” 

“Don’t put your hands in your pockets. Germs.” 

Mom is always on guard duty. Always alert. Always ready to step in and 



warn me about something. 

It makes my life a little hard. 

She doesn’t like for me to play softball with my friends. She’s sure I’ll 
break my leg. That’s if I’m lucky. If I’m unlucky, I’ll break every bone in my 
body. 

Do you know how hard it would be to break every bone in your body? 

My mom is the only person in the world who thinks people do it every day 
of the week! 

That’s why I had to sneak out of the house to go play softball at the 
playground with Jeremy and some other kids from my school. 

It was a warm, sunny day. The green lawns along Fulton Street all glowed 
in the sunlight. The air smelled fresh and sweet. 

It felt so good to be jogging down the sidewalk with Jeremy, looking 
forward to playing a game, laughing and spending time with friends. 

School had let out early because of some kind of teachers’ meeting. I 
hurried home and dropped off my backpack. 

The house was empty, except for Tyler, my dog. He’s part cocker spaniel, 
part we-don’t-know-what. 

Tyler was happy to see me. He licked my face. 

Mom doesn’t like it when I let Tyler lick my face. You know why. The 
terrible “G” word. 

Mom was out shopping or something. I guess she forgot that I’d be home 
early. 

Such a lucky break. I changed into a ragged pair of jeans and a T-shirt. 
Then I grabbed my baseball glove and hurried out to meet Jeremy before Mom 
returned home. 

“Marco, what would your mom do if she caught you playing softball?” 
Jeremy asked. 

“Warn me,” I replied. “She never punishes me or anything. She just warns 

me.” 

“My parents never warn me about anything,” Jeremy said. 

“That’s because you’re perfect!” I teased. 

Jeremy slugged me on the arm. 

Actually, I wasn’t teasing. Jeremy is perfect. He gets all A’s in school. He’s 
good at sports. He takes care of his little sister. He almost never gets in trouble. 

He doesn’t touch anything with germs. 



Perfect... 

We passed the bus stop and crossed Fairchild Avenue. Our school came into 
view. It’s a long, one-story building that stretches in a straight line for nearly a 
whole block. 

The walls of the school are painted bright yellow. As yellow as an egg yolk. 
Mom says they discuss the color a lot at Parent Association meetings. No one 
likes it. 

Jeremy and I jogged through the teachers’ parking lot to the playground 
behind the building. The softball diamond stood behind the row of swings. 

A bunch of kids were already there. I recognized Gwynnie Evans and Leo 
Murphy. 

The Franklin twins were arguing as usual, standing nose to nose, screaming 
at each other. They’re weird guys. You can never put them on the same team. 

“You can start now!” Jeremy shouted. “The all-stars are here!” 

He took off across the grass. Leo and some of the other kids called out to 
us. 

I slowed to a walk, breathing hard. Jeremy is a lot better athlete than I am. 

Gwynnie stood on the pitching mound, swinging two bats and talking to 
Lauren Blank. Gwynnie is always trying to prove that she’s better in sports than 
any of the boys. 

She’s big and strong. She’s at least half a foot taller than me, and she’s got 
much bigger shoulders. She’s always pushing kids around and acting tough. 

No one likes her. But we always want her on our team because she can hit 
the ball a mile. And if some kind of argument breaks out, Gwynnie always wins 
it because she can yell the loudest. 

“Let’s get started,” Jeremy declared. 

“Who’s choosing up sides?” I asked. “Who are the captains?” 

Leo pointed. “Gwynnie and Lauren.” 

I took off running to the pitcher’s mound. Gwynnie dropped one of the bats 
to the ground. She had the other one in her grip. 

I guess she didn’t see me. 

As I ran up to her, she pulled the bat back—and swung it with all her might. 

I saw the bat move. 

But I didn’t have time to duck or move out of the way. 

The bat made a loud THUNK as it slammed into the side of my head. 

At first, I didn’t feel a thing. 



The ground tilted up. 

But I still didn’t feel anything. 

Then the pain exploded in my head. 

Exploded... exploded... exploded. 

Everything flashed bright red. 

So bright, I had to shut my eyes. 

I heard myself shrieking. Neighing like a horse. A shrill wail I never heard 
before. 

And then the ground flew up to swallow me. 



2 


I woke up staring at the ceiling. 

A blue ceiling light—blue as the sky—blurred then sharpened, blurred then 
sharpened above me. 

Mom’s face floated into view. 

I blinked once. Twice. I knew I was home. 

Mom’s eyes were red and wet. She had her black hair pulled back tightly. 
But several strands had fallen loose and hung down her forehead. 

Her chin trembled. “Marco—?” 

I groaned. 

My head ached. Everything ached. 

I’ve done it, I thought. I’ve broken every bone in my body. 

“Marco—?” Mom repeated in a whisper. “Are you waking up, dear?” 

“Huh?” I groaned again. 

Something was sitting on my head. Weighing me down. 

Tyler? Why was the dog sitting on my head? 

My arms ached as I slowly raised my hands to my head. 

And felt a bandage. A heavy bandage. 

I lowered my hands. The room began to spin. I gripped the couch cushions, 
holding on for dear life. 

I stared up at the blue ceiling light until it came into focus. The den. I was 
lying on the soft leather couch in the den. 

Mom floated into view again, her chin still trembling. She pulled a blanket 
up nearly to my chin. “Marco? You’re awake?” she repeated. “How do you 
feel?” 

“Great,” I muttered. 

Talking made my throat hurt. 

She stared down at me. “Can you see me, dear? It’s me. Your mom.” 

“Yeah. I can see,” I whispered. 

She wiped one eye with a tissue. Then she stared at me some more. 

“I can see fine,” I told her. 

She patted my chest over the blanket. “That’s good, dear.” 



I groaned in reply. 

Please don’t say, I told you so! I thought. I crossed my fingers, even though 
it hurt to cross them. And I prayed. Please don’t say I told you so. 

Mom’s expression changed. She frowned at me. “I told you not to play 
baseball,” she said. 

“It wasn’t baseball,” I choked out. “It was soft-ball.” 

“I told you not to play,” Mom said sternly. “But you didn’t listen to me. 
And now you’ve cracked your head open like an eggshell.” 

“Huh?” I gasped. “Cracked it open? Mom, will I be okay?” 

She didn’t answer. 

“Will I?” I demanded. “Tell me the truth. What did the doctor say, Mom? 
Will I be okay?” 



3 


“Of course,” she replied. Her face floated over me for a second, then slid out of 
view. 

I didn’t like the way she said it. It sounded false. Too cheerful. 

“Tell me the truth,” I insisted. “Am I really going to be okay?” 

No answer. 

I lifted my head. Sharp pain shot down the back of my neck. 

Mom had vanished from the room. I could hear her putting plates away in 
the kitchen. 

I tried calling her. But my voice came out in a hoarse whisper. 

I lowered my head slowly to the couch cushion and shut my eyes. 

I guess I drifted off to sleep. The ringing phone woke me up. 

I blinked up at the blue ceiling light, forcing it to come into focus. The 
phone rang and rang. I waited for Mom to pick it up. But she didn’t answer it. 

Did she go out and leave me all alone? I wondered. She wouldn’t do that. 
Where is she? 

Groaning, I rolled onto my side and grabbed the phone off the coffee table. 
I raised it to my ear. 

“Owww! ” 

I banged it too hard against the bandage over my head. The side of my head 
throbbed with pain. 

“Hello?” I croaked. 

I heard breathing on the other end. And then a voice I didn’t recognize said, 
“I hope you’re okay, Marco.” 

“Who—who is this?” I stammered. I shut my eyes tight, trying to push 
away the pain of my throbbing head. 

“I hope you’re okay,” the voice repeated. A boy’s voice. “I don’t want 
anything bad to happen to you.” 

“Huh? You don’t?” I murmured. “Uh... thanks.” I kept my eyes shut. The 
pain pulsed at my temples. It was hard to hold the phone over the heavy 
bandage. 

“Who is this?” I demanded again. 



“I don’t want anything bad to happen to you,” the boy said again. “Because 
you’re going to take care of me from now on.” 

“Excuse me?” I choked out. “I don’t understand.” 

Silence at the other end. 

I took a deep breath. I decided to ask the question one more time. “Who is 
this?” 

“It’s me,” the voice replied. “Keith.” 

“Keith?” 

“Yes. Keith.” 

“I—I don’t know you,” I stammered. 

“You should,” the boy replied softly. “You should know me, Marco. I live 
in your basement.” 



4 


Did I hang up? Or did Keith hang up? 

I’m not sure. I felt very confused, very upset. 

Keith hadn’t called to be friendly. I knew he was trying to scare me. 

But, why? 

Was it actually a friend of mine? Someone from school playing a joke? It 
wasn’t a very funny joke. 

I stared at the ceiling, feeling groggy and weak. I don’t know how much 
time passed. 

I kept picturing Gwynnie standing on the pitcher’s mound. I saw her 
swinging two bats. Then one. I saw the bat whirling toward my head. 

“Ohhh.” I uttered a low moan and forced the picture from my mind. 

“How are you doing, Marco?” a voice whispered. 

I gazed up at Mom. She had brushed her hair and put on lipstick. She had 
changed into a bright green T-shirt and a dark skirt. 

“Feeling better?” she asked. “I brought you a bowl of cereal. You should try 
eating something. If you don’t eat, acid will burn a hole in your stomach.” 

“Mom—the phone,” I started groggily. “It rang and—” 

“Yes, I know,” she interrupted. “It was Jeremy. He wanted to know if he 
could come over to see you.” 

“Huh? Jeremy?” 

She nodded. “I told him you weren’t quite ready for visitors. I said he could 
probably come tomorrow.” 

“I didn’t mean that call,” I said. I pulled myself up onto my elbows. My 
head didn’t throb as badly. The room didn’t spin and tilt. 

I was starting to feel a little stronger. 

“I got another call,” I told her. “You didn’t pick up, so I answered it.” 

“But, Marco—” Mom started. 

“It was from a strange boy,” I continued. “It was a very weird call. He said 
his name was Keith. And he said he lived in our basement.” 

Mom’s expression changed. She lowered her eyes. “Oh, wow,” she 
murmured. 



“It was kind of a frightening call,” I said. “Why would somebody call and 
say they lived in our basement?” 

Mom placed a cool hand on my hot forehead. “I—I’m a little worried about 
you, Marco,” she said softly. 

“Huh? What do you mean?” 

“You have to take things slowly,” she replied. “You didn’t listen to my 
warnings. And you had a very bad hit on the head.” 

“But, Mom, that phone call I got—” 

Her chin quivered again. “You’re not thinking clearly, Marco,” she said. 

“Why? Why do you say that?” I demanded. 

She narrowed her eyes at me. “There’s no phone in this room,” she said.

I woke up early the next morning. I sat up, feeling alert. Refreshed. Before I 
even stood up, I knew I was a lot better. 

My head didn’t throb. My muscles didn’t ache. 

I took a long shower. The water felt so crisp and sharp on my skin. 

I was drying myself when I realized I no longer had the bandage on my 
head. I spotted it on the floor by my bed. I guessed it had fallen off during the 
night. 

Stepping up to the medicine chest mirror, I checked out the damage. Not 
too bad. I had an ugly purple bruise on my right temple. It had swelled up like a 
giant mosquito bite. 

But the rest of my head had its normal shape. 

I winked at myself. My eyes seemed sharp and clear. 

I let out a loud cheer. My throat didn’t hurt. I was so happy to be feeling 
strong again. 

I pulled on a pair of baggy jeans and a sweatshirt. And I hurried down to 
the kitchen for breakfast. 

“Don’t run in the kitchen like that,” Mom warned. “You’ll bang into the 
counter and break your kneecap.” 

Kneecap? 

That was a new one! 

“I’m starving!” I cried. I poured myself a big bowl of my favorite cereal 
combo—Frosted Flakes and Corn Pops, all mixed together. I grabbed a spoon 
and began gobbling hungrily. 

“Don’t eat cereal so fast,” Mom warned. “It’ll clog your stomach pipes.” 

I’d heard that one before. 

“Guess you’re feeling better,” Mom said. She smiled at me and squeezed 
my hand. 

I nodded. “I feel fine,” I told her. “What day is it?” 

“Saturday,” she replied. Her smile faded. “I’m glad you’re feeling better. 
But I want you to stay in today.” 

“You always want me to stay in,” I grumbled. 

“You’re still weak,” she said. “You might faint and hit your head on the 



sidewalk.” 

‘Til stay in,” I promised. 

A loud THUD THUD made me jump. “What was that?” I yelped. 

Mom stood up. She studied me. “It’s just someone knocking on the door,” 
she said. “See? You’re still not yourself, Marco.” 

“I said I won’t go out,” I groaned. 

Jeremy came into the kitchen. He stopped halfway across the room and 
stared at me. “Are you alive?” he asked. 

I pinched my arm. “Yeah,” I told him. 

“Don’t pinch yourself. You’ll make a bruise,” Mom warned. 

Jeremy didn’t come any closer. He stood in the middle of the kitchen and 
stared at me. 

“Why don’t you sit down while I finish my cereal?” I asked him. “It’s okay 
to come over here. You won’t catch what I’ve got.” 

“Did you eat breakfast?” Mom asked Jeremy. “Never go out on an empty 
stomach. Your whole system will stop working.” 

Jeremy walked slowly to the table. “I just keep picturing Gwynnie swinging 
that bat,” he said. He swallowed hard. “It was so horrible. I saw the whole 
thing.” 

He dropped into the chair next to me and sighed. “I thought she knocked 
your head off, Marco. I really did. I was sick. I thought I was going to heave up 
my lunch on the grass.” 

“Don’t talk about heaving at the breakfast table,” Mom scolded. She started 
for the door. “I have to leave for a short while, Marco. Remember your promise. 
Don’t go out.” 

“I remember,” I muttered. 

“And take it easy,” she instructed. “Just sit and talk. Don’t do anything else. 
You’ll pass out.” 

When she disappeared, Jeremy turned to me. “You really okay?” he asked. 

I nodded. “Yeah. I don’t feel bad at all.” I finished the last of the cereal and 
poured myself a glass of orange juice. “I feel a lot better than yesterday,” I 
declared. 

“Gwynnie called me last night,” Jeremy said. “She wanted to know how 
you were doing. She was really messed up. You know. About hitting you.” 

I snickered. “You mean she didn’t brag about what a great swing she has?” 

“No way!” Jeremy insisted. 



“Well, it wasn’t her fault,” I said. “I ran right into her bat. It was a real 
smooth move.” 

We talked about the accident for a while longer. Then I asked Jeremy if he 
wanted to feel the purple bump on the side of my head. 

“Hey—no way!” he cried, making a sick face. 

I knew that would gross him out. 

He helped me put away the breakfast stuff. “What do you want to do?” I 
asked him. 

“Your mom said you can’t go out,” Jeremy reminded me. 

“So we’ll stay in,” I replied. 

“Want to play pool?” he suggested. 

We have a pool table in our basement. It’s a regulation-size table, and there 
isn’t quite enough room for it. You have to tilt your pool cue up and play around 
the concrete beams. 

“Yeah. I’ll play you,” I agreed. He’s a much better pool player than I am. 
But sometimes I get lucky and beat him. 

I finished shoving the breakfast dishes into the dishwasher. Then I led the 
way to the basement door. 

I reached for the doorknob—then stopped. 

I live in your basement 

I remembered the boy’s voice on the phone. So flat and cold. 

You’re going to take care of me from now on.... I live in your basement. 

His words came back to me. They made me hesitate at the door. 

But I only imagined that call, I told myself. 

There was no boy. No voice. No Keith. 

I imagined it because I got hit on the head. 

Right? 

I pulled open the door. I gazed down the basement steps. 

Then, gripping the banister, I led the way down. 



6 


As soon as I reached the basement, I ran around turning on all the lights. Even in 
the laundry room. 

Jeremy picked up a pool cue and began to chalk the tip. “What is your 
problem, Marco?” he called. “Are we going to play or not?” 

“I like a lot of light,” I told him. 

I peeked behind the big stack of cartons near the furnace. Then I squeezed 
behind the furnace to see if anyone was living back there. 

Nothing but a tall mountain of dust. I was beginning to feel a little silly. 

Why would anyone be living in my basement? The whole idea was crazy. 

I trotted over to the pool table and picked out a cue. Then Jeremy and I 
began to play. 

He sank the three ball in a side pocket. On his next shot, balls clattered all 
over the table. But nothing dropped in. 

My turn. I had to squeeze between the table and a concrete pole and tilt the 
cue up toward the ceiling. Not an easy shot. 

I missed everything. 

“Did you ever play pool with Gwynnie?” Jeremy asked, moving around the 
table to find his best shot. 

“No. Never,” I told him. “Is she any good?” 

He snickered. “She plays pool the way she plays softball. She hits the balls 
so hard, she cracks them. A bunch of us were playing once at the Youth Center. 
Gwynnie sent a ball flying off the table, and it sailed out the window!” 

“Maybe she thinks she has to hit a home run!” I joked. 

We both laughed. Laughing made the side of my head hurt. 

Thinking about Gwynnie made my head hurt! 

Jeremy bounced the seven ball into the eight ball. The eight ball almost 
dropped into a corner pocket. “That was close!” He sighed. 

Maybe you don’t know the rules of pool. If the eight ball goes in, you lose. 

That’s the only way I ever beat Jeremy. 

“The Franklin twins were playing at the Youth Center too,” Jeremy 
continued. “And they got into a fight.” 



I rolled my eyes. “So what else is new?” 

“It was so dumb,” Jeremy said. “They were arguing over which is the six 
ball and which is the nine ball. They started fencing with their pool cues. And 
then they smeared blue chalk all over each other.” 

“Nice,” I murmured. I hit the twelve ball a solid shot, but it didn’t go in. 
“Why do you think the Franklin twins fight all the time?” I asked. 

Jeremy thought about it for a moment. “Because they’re twins,” he said 
finally. “Even they can’t tell each other apart. And so they have to prove they’re 
different from each other.” 

“That’s very deep,” I replied. I wanted to think about that. 

But a strange sound made me spin away from the table. 

A scratching sound. Very close. 

A scratch. Then a BUMP. 

“Did you hear that?” I whispered to Jeremy. 

He nodded. “Yes.” He pointed to the stairs. 

Another BUMP. 

We have a large pantry cabinet under the stairwell. The noises were coming 
from inside the cabinet. 

We both stared at the wooden cabinet door. 

Another BUMP. 

“There’s someone in there,” I muttered. “Someone trying to get out.” 

Jeremy narrowed his eyes at me. “Why would someone be hiding in your 
cabinet?” 

I made my way over to the cabinet door. “Who’s in there?” I called. 

No reply. 

A scraping sound. Someone right behind the door. 

“Who is it?” I repeated. 

No reply. 

I grabbed the cabinet door. Took a deep breath. Tugged it open. 

And screamed as a creature leaped out at me. 



7 


“A squirrel!” Jeremy cried. 

Yes. A fat gray squirrel jumped from the closet—onto my leg. 

It fell off. Hit the floor, its eyes wild, its legs thrashing the air. Sliding on 
the linoleum, it took off across the basement. 

“How did a squirrel get in there?” Jeremy asked. 

I was still too startled to reply. I watched the squirrel try to climb one of the 
concrete beams. It slipped off, turned, and ran toward the laundry room. 

I finally found my voice. “We’ve got to get it out of here!” I shrieked. 
“Mom freaks out when animals get in the house. You know. They have germs.” 

The squirrel was staring back at us from the laundry room door. “Get him!” 
I cried. 

Jeremy and I chased after the squirrel. 

It darted around the laundry room. Behind the dryer. Nowhere to run now. 

“I’ve got it!” I shrieked. I stretched out my hands and made a wild dive. 

But the squirrel scampered right over my back. Dodged past Jeremy. And 
raced back into the main room. 

My head started to throb. I was breathing hard. 

I darted out of the laundry room. The squirrel ran under the pool table, its 
bushy tail standing straight up. 

I checked to make sure both basement windows were open. Then I grabbed 
an old fishing net from against the wall. 

The frightened animal stopped running and turned back to Jeremy and me. 
Its whole body trembled. Its little black eyes pleaded with us. 

“Here, squirrel! Here, squirrel!” I called to it, waving the net. “We’re not 
going to hurt you.” 

I swiped the net at it. Missed. 

The squirrel took off. Jeremy dove for it. He missed too. 

As we watched helplessly, the squirrel jumped onto the pile of cartons by 
the furnace. Climbed to the top. And leaped out of the basement window. 

“Yesssss!” Jeremy and I both cheered and slapped each other a high five. 

“Victory over all squirrels!” Jeremy boomed in his deepest voice. 



I didn’t know what that was supposed to mean. But we both burst out 
laughing. 

Mom’s voice from the top of the stairs cut our laughter short. “What’s going 
on down there?” she called. 

“Nothing,” I replied quickly. “Just playing pool.” 

“Marco—be careful with those pool sticks,” she shouted. “You’ll poke your 
eye out.” 

Jeremy and I played a few games. He beat me easily each time. But we had fun. 
And we didn’t poke out any eyes. 

Mom made us sandwiches and chicken noodle soup for lunch. She kept 
warning us to blow on the soup or else we’d burn the skin off our tongues. 

Yuck. 

After lunch, I started to feel tired. So Jeremy went home. 

“Go up to your room and watch TV or take a nap,” Mom advised. “I 
warned you not to overdo it.” 

“I didn’t overdo it,” I grumbled. But I went upstairs and took a long nap. 

Too long. Late that night, I couldn’t get to sleep. I felt wide awake. 

I read for a while. Then I did a little channel surfing, but I didn’t find 
anything good to watch. 

I glanced at my bed table clock. A few minutes after midnight. 

My stomach growled. Maybe I need a midnight snack, I decided. 

I clicked on the hall light and made my way downstairs to the kitchen. But I 
didn’t get as far as the kitchen. To my surprise, the basement door stood open. 

“Weird,” I muttered. Mom always keeps that door closed. She’s a nut about 
keeping doors shut. 

I walked over to the door. And started to push it closed. 

But I stopped when I heard a scraping sound down there. 

Footsteps? 

I poked my head into the opening and peered down into the darkness. “Who 
—who’s down there?” I called. 

I heard more scraping steps. 

And then a boy’s voice called up. “It’s me. Keith. Don’t you remember? I 
live down here.” 



8 


“No! You don’t exist!” 

The words burst from my mouth. My cry sounded shrill and frightened. 

I heard more footsteps on the linoleum floor. Then the basement light 
flashed on. 

And I stared down at—Mom! 

“Huh?” I gasped. 

“Marco—why aren’t you asleep?” she demanded, frowning up at me, hands 
at her waist. 

“Uh... because I’m awake,” I replied. “Mom, what are you doing down 
there?” 

“Laundry,” she said. “I couldn’t sleep, either. So I decided to do laundry. 
You know. It always relaxes me.” 

“Mom—come upstairs. Now!” I cried. “There’s someone down there with 
you!” 

She squinted up at me. Tilted her head, examining me with her eyes. “What 
do you mean?” she asked softly. 

“Hurry!” I insisted. “That boy. He talked to me again. He’s down there, 
Mom. He says he lives down there.” 

“Marco, I’m worried about you,” Mom said calmly. She started up the 
stairs, her eyes locked on me. “You’re not making any sense, dear.” 

“But I am\” I insisted. “I heard him, Mom. He talked to me—just now! 
He’s down there! Really!” 

“It’s too late to call Dr. Bailey,” she fretted. She stepped up beside me and 
pressed her palm against my forehead. “No fever.” 

“Mom—I’m not imagining it!” I wailed. 

“Tomorrow is Sunday,” she said. “I want you to rest all day. Then we’ll see 
if you are ready to go back to school on Monday.” 

“But, Mom—” I started. “I—” 

The boy’s voice interrupted me from downstairs. “Marco,” he called, “listen 
to your mother.” 

“Mom—did you hear that?” I shrieked. 



9 


“Hear what?” Mom demanded, eyeing me sharply. 

“The boy—” I started. But I didn’t finish. Someone bumped me hard from 
behind. 

I stumbled toward the basement—and nearly fell down the stairs. 

“Whoa—!” I let out a cry and spun around. 

Tyler wagged his tail at me. He shuffled forward and bumped me again. He 
does that all the time. Just to be friendly, I guess. 

“You stupid dog!” I shrieked. “You nearly killed me!” 

Tyler stopped wagging. He stared up at me with his big brown eyes. 

“Don’t yell at the dog,” Mom scolded. “You’re really not doing well, 
Marco. Let’s tuck you in, okay? You are definitely overtired.” 

“But, Mom—” 

I decided not to argue. What was the point? 

I glanced down into the basement, hoping to catch a glimpse of the boy. But 
I saw only darkness. 

Where was he? Where was he hiding? 

I knew I hadn’t imagined him. I knew I had really heard him. 

So what was going on? 

Mom let me go to school on Monday. The way things turned out, I wished she 
had kept me home. 

I felt fine. The bump on my head was still purple. But it had shrunk to about 
the size of a quarter. 

When I went into the school building, everyone ran up to me. The Franklin 
twins were arguing about which backpack was whose. They are always getting 
their stuff mixed up. 

But when they saw me, they dropped both backpacks and hurried over. 

“Marco—how are you?” 

“Are you okay?” 

“Let me see your bruise.” 

“Wow. That’s real ugly!” 



“Does it hurt?” 

“I can’t believe you’re back!” 

“You must have a really hard head!” 

Everyone laughed and joked and made a big fuss over me. I enjoyed being 
the center of attention for once. Usually, no one pays any attention to me at all! 

I was feeling pretty good about things. 

Until the bell rang and Miss Mosely asked me to come up to the front of the 
class. “I think we’re all glad to see you in school today, Marco,” she said. 

Jeremy started clapping, and then everyone else clapped. Even Gwynnie, 
who sits right in front of the teacher. 

“Since we’ve been studying health care,” Miss Mosely continued, “I want 
you to tell everyone what it was like in the hospital.” 

Hospital? 

I stared at her. My brain did a flip-flop. My mouth dropped open. 

Had I been in the hospital? 

“What was your room like in the hospital?” Miss Mosely asked. “What 
kind of doctor examined you? What did the doctor look for?” 

I blinked. Thinking hard. Trying to remember. 

“Tell us everything,” Miss Mosely insisted. She crossed her arms and stared 
at me through her round, black-framed eyeglasses, waiting for me to talk. 

“I—I don’t remember,” I stammered. 

One of the Franklin twins laughed. A few kids whispered to each other. 

“Well, what do you remember about the hospital, Marco?” Miss Mosely 
asked, speaking slowly and clearly as if talking to a three-year-old. 

“I don’t remember anything. Nothing at all!” I blurted out. 

Gwynnie leaned forward so that she practically hung over Miss Mosely’s 
desk. “Maybe I should hit him on the head again,” she said. “You know. To help 
bring back his memory.” 

A few kids laughed. 

Miss Mosely frowned at Gwynnie. “That’s a terrible thing to say. It’s not a 
joke. Memory loss from a hit on the head can be very serious.” 

Gwynnie shrugged her big shoulders. “Just kidding,” she muttered. “Can’t 
anyone take a joke?” 

Meanwhile, I was still standing up there in front of everyone. Feeling 
awkward and confused. 

Why didn’t I remember the hospital? The first thing I remembered, I was 



lying on the den couch at home. 

Miss Mosely motioned for me to sit down. “We’re glad you’re okay, 
Marco,” she said. “And don’t worry about the things you forgot. Your memory 
will come back.” 

Up till then, I didn’t know it had left. I dropped into my seat, feeling weak 
and shaken. 

The rest of the day was a blur. 

I was still thinking hard that afternoon as I started walking home. Still 
trying to remember something about the hospital. 

I saw some kids starting a softball game on the playground diamond. 
Thinking about softball gave me a chill. 

I started to turn away—but someone caught my eye. 

Gwynnie! 

She came chasing after me across the grass. She carried a baseball bat, 
raised high over her head. 

She had a grim, determined look on her face. 

“Marco! Hey—Marco!” she called, waving the bat menacingly. 

She’s going to hit me again, I knew. 

But, why? 

“No—!” I let out a cry. And gaped at her in horror. 

“Gwynnie—please don’t!” 



10 


“Marco! Hey—Marco!” 

Gwynnie had a fierce look on her face. She swung the bat over her head 
again. 

I froze. My legs refused to move. 

With a loud cry, I finally managed to turn away. And I started to run. 

I hurtled across the street without checking for traffic. What is her problem? 
Is she crazy? I asked myself. Why is she doing this? 

Did Gwynnie really think she could bring back my memory with a smack 
on the head? 

I turned the corner, breathing hard, the backpack bouncing on my shoulders. 
Glancing back, I saw her on the other side of the street. Two school buses 
rumbled by, forcing her to wait. 

I lowered my head, shifted the backpack, and forced myself to pick up 
speed. 

By the time I reached home, my heart pounded so hard it hurt. And the 
bump on my head throbbed with pain. 

I dove into the house and slammed the door behind me. Then I pressed my 
back against the door and struggled to catch my breath. 

“Marco? Is that you?” Mom called from the den. 

Still gasping for breath, I tried to choke out an answer. But only a low 
croaking sound escaped my throat. 

Mom appeared in the living room doorway. She narrowed her eyes, 
studying me. “How was your first day back?” 

“Okay,” I managed to murmur. 

“You didn’t overdo it—did you?” she demanded. “Why do you look so 
pale? Did you take gym, Marco? I gave you a note to excuse you from gym— 
remember?” 

“We... didn’t... have... gym,” I gasped. 

Mom was always giving me notes to excuse me from gym. She was sure I’d 
poke my eye out or break every bone in my body in gym class. 

“Why are you so out of breath?” she asked, crossing the room tome. She 
placed a hand on my forehead. “You’re sweating. Didn’t I warn you about 



sweating? It’ll give you a cold.” 

“Really. I’m fine,” I said, starting to feel normal again. I slipped out from 
under her hand and peeked out the front window. 

Had Gwynnie chased me all the way home? 

I didn’t see her out there. 

“I felt okay today,” I told her. “No problem.” 

I wanted to ask her about the hospital. But I didn’t want her to know that I’d 
lost my memory. It would only cause a lot more trouble. 

So I didn’t say anything about it. Instead, I made my way to the stairs. “I’ve 
got a lot of homework to catch up on,” I told her. “I’ll be up in my room.” 

“Do you want a snack?” she called after me. “You shouldn’t do homework 
on an empty stomach.” 

“No thanks,” I replied. I climbed the stairs and hurried down the hall. 

I stopped in the doorway. 

And let out a startled cry when I saw a boy sitting on my bed. 

He looked about my age. He had wavy black hair around a thin, serious 
face. He gazed at me with round dark eyes. Sad eyes. He wore black denim jeans 
and a loose-fitting plaid flannel shirt. 

He didn’t appear at all surprised to see me. 

“Who—who are you?” I stammered. 

“It’s me. Keith,” he replied softly. “I told you. I live in your basement.” 



11 


I didn’t say anything. My mind went blank. I stared at the boy from out in the 
hall. 

My knees suddenly felt weak and trembly. I grabbed the sides of the 
doorframe to keep from falling. 

A cruel smile spread slowly over Keith’s face. His dark eyes flashed. 
“Come in. I thought we should get to know each other,” he said. “Since you are 
going to take care of me from now on.” 

I swallowed hard. 

I stood there frozen for a long moment. 

And then I screamed, “No! No way!” 

I pulled the bedroom door shut. It had a key and a lock, which we never 

use. 

My hand trembled as I grabbed the key and turned it. 

I tested the door. 

Yes! I had locked Keith in. He was trapped inside my bedroom. 

Now Mom would see him. Now she would have to believe me. 

“Mom!” I shouted. “Come up here! Hurry!” 

No reply. 

Had she gone out? 

No. She was probably in the kitchen starting dinner. 

I tested the door again, making sure it was locked tight. Then I plunged 
down the stairs, calling to her. 

“Marco? What on earth—?” She came running from the kitchen, carrying 
an onion and a knife. 

“Come upstairs! Hurry!” I cried. “I’ve caught him! He’s in my room!” 
“Caught who?” She eyed me suspiciously. “Who is in your room?” 

“The boy!” I shouted. I grabbed her by the arm and started to pull her up 
the stairs. “Keith. The boy who lives in the basement.” 

“Marco—wait.” Mom tugged her arm free. “Please don’t start that again. 
You know how worried I get when you start talking crazy.” 

“I’m not crazy!” I wailed. 



I grabbed her arm again. The onion fell out of her hand and bounced across 
the floor. 

“Stop pulling me. I’m coming,” she snapped. “You’re acting very strange, 
Marco. I don’t like this one bit. Dr. Bailey said that if you started acting in a 
weird manner, I should call him immediately and—” 

“Mom—just don’t talk!” I begged. “Don’t say another word. Please— 
follow me. He’s in my room. I locked him in. You’ll see him with your own 
eyes. Then you’ll know I’m not crazy.” 

She grumbled, but she followed me up the stairs. 

I stopped outside my room and reached for the key. My heart pounded so 
hard, I thought my chest might explode. My head started to throb. 

I turned the key. And pushed open my bedroom door. 

“There!” I declared, pointing to my bed. 



12 


Mom and I both let out cries of surprise. 

Tyler sat staring at us from the bed. 

He panted loudly. His tongue hung out. When he saw us, his tail started to 

wag. 

Mom placed a firm hand on my shoulder. “Go lie down on that bed, 
Marco,” she ordered. “I’m calling the doctor right now.” 

“No. Wait,” I insisted. I ducked out from under her grip. 

I dropped to the floor and peered under the bed. “Keith—where are you?” 
Not under there. 

I climbed to my feet, ran across the room, and tugged open the closet door. 
“Keith—?” 

No. 

I spun around. Where else could he be hiding? 

Tyler leaped off the bed and bounded from the room. 

“That poor dog doesn’t like being locked up,” Mom fretted. 

“I didn’t lock him in here!” I shouted. “I locked Keith in.” 

She tsk-tsked. “You’re going to be fine, Marco. Really you are.” Her voice 
trembled. 

It was easy to figure out what she really meant: That hit on the head 
scrambled your brains, Marco. You’re acting like a total nutcase! 

I took a deep breath and tried to explain again. “Mom, I don’t know how 
Tyler got in here. But I do know there was a boy in my room. And I locked him 
in.” 

“I’m going to phone Dr. Bailey right now,” Mom replied. “But I don’t want 
you to worry. Everything will be okay.” She hurried from the room. 

Everything will be okay. Mom’s words lingered in my mind. 

As usual, she was wrong. 

Dr. Bailey’s waiting room was all blue and green. A huge fish tank against one 
wall bubbled quietly. The blue and green chairs, blue and green carpet, and blue 
and green walls made me feel as if I were in a fish tank too! 



Mom and I checked in with the woman behind the desk. Then we sat down 
on a hard plastic couch against the wall. 

On the plastic chairs across from us, a girl sat with her father. The girl was 
about seven or eight. Every few seconds, she hiccupped loudly. Her whole body 
shook with each hiccup. 

“She’s been doing that for two weeks,” her father explained, shaking his 
head. 

“Dad,” the girl snapped, “it’s only been HIC ten days.” 

“Has she been eating eggs?” Mom asked the father. “Too many eggs can 
give you the hiccups.” 

The man stared at Mom. 

“It’s the egg whites,” Mom continued. “They’re too slippery. You can’t 
digest them.” 

The man stared at Mom some more. Finally he murmured, “I don’t think it 
was eggs.” 

The girl hiccupped and shook. 

The fish tank bubbled. 

I felt as if I were swimming with the fish. Floating through thick blue water. 

But I can’t breathe underwater! I told myself. 

The girl hiccupped again. 

The sound was starting to drive me crazy. I wanted to go home. I turned to 
Mom, who had picked up a magazine and was thumbing through it. “Can we 
go?” I pleaded. “I’m okay.” 

She shook her head. “Dr. Bailey just wants to look at you,” she replied, 
keeping her eyes on the magazine. “A hit on the head is serious. You only have 
one head, you know.” 

The girl hiccupped. 

“Try holding your breath,” her father instructed her. 

“I’ve been holding it for ten days!” she grumbled. 

Several hundred hiccups later, the nurse led Mom and me into Dr. Bailey’s 
office. As I stepped inside, I saw that his office was blue and green too. 

The doctor was a cheerful, chubby man. He had a round face, a shiny, bald 
head, and he wore a bow tie under his green lab coat. The bow tie bobbed up and 
down on his Adam’s apple when he talked. 

He came around the desk to shake hands with me. Then he used his thumbs 
to pull up my eyelids so that he could examine my eyes. 



“Hmmm... looks okay,” he murmured. 

He ran his thumb gently over the bump on my head. “Does that hurt, 
Marco?” 

“A little,” I confessed. 

“It’s healing nicely,” he told Mom. “Very nicely indeed. Now what seems to 
be the problem, Marco?” 

I hesitated. Should I tell him about Keith? If I do, will he think I’m crazy 
too? Will he send me back to the hospital or something? 

Should I tell him I don’t remember anything about being in the hospital? 

Dr. Bailey gazed at me patiently, waiting for me to begin. 

Finally, I decided, okay, I’ll tell him everything. He’s a doctor, after all. He 
will understand. 

So I told him I couldn’t remember the hospital. And then I told him about 
the boy who said he lived in our basement. And I told him about actually seeing 
Keith. And locking him in my room. And finding Tyler. 

The whole story. I told him everything. It felt good to tell it. 

Dr. Bailey sat behind his desk and kept his eyes locked on me the whole 
time. His bow tie twitched on his Adam’s apple. But he didn’t say a word until I 
finished. 

Then he leaned forward and sighed. “It doesn’t sound too bad,” he said. 

“Oh, thank goodness!” Mom exclaimed. 

Dr. Bailey scratched his bald head. “But do you know what I would like to 
do just to make sure everything is okay?” he asked. 

“What?” Mom and I said together. 

“I’d like to remove your brain and examine it under a microscope,” Dr. 
Bailey said. 



13 


“Huh?” I gasped. I nearly fell out of my chair. 

“It isn’t a difficult operation,” Dr. Bailey said, flashing me a calm, 
reassuring smile. 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

“Once I crack the skull open, the brain slides out easily,” the doctor 
explained. 

“I—I don’t think so,” I protested. 

He shrugged. His bow tie hopped up and down on his throat. “I can’t really 
see the brain clearly unless I remove it.” 

My heart was pounding. My hands were suddenly icy cold. I studied Dr. 
Bailey’s round face. “You’re joking—right?” I demanded. “This is some kind of 
a sick joke?” 

Mom nudged me in the side. “Listen to the doctor,” she said. “The doctor 
knows what he’s talking about. If he says the brain comes out, it comes out.” 

Dr. Bailey leaned farther across the desk. His face loomed so close, I could 
see tiny beads of sweat on his forehead. “It won’t hurt much,” he said. 

I turned to Mom. “You’re not going to let him do it—are you?” I demanded. 

She patted my hand. “Whatever the doctor thinks is best. Dr. Bailey is a 
very good doctor, Marco. Very experienced.” 

The doctor nodded. “I’ve removed a lot of brains,” he told me. “I don’t 
mean to brag, but—” 

“Can Mom and I talk about this?” I asked, stalling for time. “Can we come 
back tomorrow or something? I feel fine. Really, I do. In fact, I feel excellent !” 

Dr. Bailey scratched his bald head again. “That’s a good idea,” he replied to 
my mom. “Why don’t you call me tomorrow? We can schedule the de-braining 
then.” 

The what? 

The de-braining? 

I jumped up from my chair and darted for the door. I didn’t wait for Mom. I 
didn’t say good-bye. I just ran. 

Mom followed me into the waiting room. “Marco, that was really rude of 
you!” she scolded. 



“I’d like to keep my brain,” I replied angrily, and kept walking to the office 
door. As we passed, I said good-bye to the girl with hiccups. 

“Hie Hie Hie,” she said. I think her problem was getting worse! 

“Doctors know what’s best,” Mom said, hurrying across the parking lot 
after me. 

I climbed into the car and crossed my arms over my chest. “I’m perfectly 
okay, Mom,” I told her through gritted teeth. “My brain is totally normal. I’ll 
never see that boy Keith again. He’s gone forever. I know he is. I’ll never see or 
hear him again.” 

But of course I was wrong. 



14 


Mom said not to worry about losing my brain. She said we’d wait a few days 
before deciding what to do. 

That made me feel a lot better. 

That night, I was writing a homework assignment on my computer. Miss 
Mosely had given us a creative writing assignment. We had to write a story from 
someone else’s point of view. 

I decided to write about a typical day from Tyler’s point of view. It was fun 
to try to get inside the mind of a dog. 

A dog has an IQ of ten. That’s what I learned on one of those science shows 
on TV. A ten IQ isn’t very smart. You can’t figure too many things out with an 
IQ of ten. That’s why Tyler always looks confused and surprised. 

That’s why he can spend ten minutes barking at a plastic trash bag. 

I leaned over my keyboard, typing away. I was enjoying myself. I don’t 
usually like to write papers, but this was a fun assignment. 

When the phone rang, I groaned and kept typing. I waited for Mom to pick 
it up downstairs. But she didn’t. 

I stood up and walked over to the phone on my bed table. A chill froze the 
back of my neck. 

Was it him? Was it Keith? 

I remembered the first time he had called. The day I’d been hit on the head. 

My hand grabbed the phone, but I didn’t pick it up. I couldn’t decide what 
to do. I didn’t want to talk to him again. I wanted him to disappear. 

On the sixth ring, I lifted the phone to my ear. “Hello?” 

“Hi, Marco. It’s me.” 

Another chill ran down the back of my neck. Then I recognized the voice. 
“Jeremy?” 

“Yeah. Hi. What’s up?” 

“Jeremy?” I repeated. 

“Yeah. You okay, Marco? I just wondered how you were doing.” 

“Oh. I’m okay,” I told him. I sat down on the edge of my bed. “I’m feeling 
all right. I’m working on the creative writing assignment.” 

“Yeah. Me too,” Jeremy replied. “Whose point of view did you choose?” 



“My dog’s,” I replied. 

He laughed. “I’m writing about my cat!” 

“You think everyone in class chose an animal?” I asked. “That would be 
funny.” 

We talked and laughed about stuff for a while. Talking to Jeremy cheered 
me up. I was starting to feel really normal again. 

“I’d better get back to work,” I said after a few more minutes. I set down 
the phone and crossed the room to my computer. 

I started to sit down—but stopped when I saw the monitor screen. 

My writing—my words—had all disappeared. 

A face stared out at me from the screen. 

Keith’s face! 

“No—!” I let out a cry. 

And a powerful arm slid around my neck from behind. And began to 
tighten around my throat. 



15 


“Unnnnh.” 

I struggled to breathe. 

The arm tightened around me. 

I tossed up my hands. Spun around hard. 

And gaped at Gwynnie. 

She stepped back, grinning. 

“Huh?” I choked out. “What’s the big idea?” 

Her grin grew wider. “Did I scare you?” 

“No,” I replied, still breathing hard. “I’m used to people sneaking in and 
strangling me from behind.” 

She laughed. “I wanted to surprise you. Guess I don’t know my own 
strength.” 

“Sure you do,” I muttered, rubbing my neck. “What are you doing here, 
Gwynnie?” 

She dropped down heavily onto my desk chair. “Actually, I came to 
apologize.” 

“Huh?” My mouth dropped open. 

“Really,” she insisted. She used both hands to brush her thick black hair 
back over her broad shoulders. “I felt bad about my joke in class today. You 
know. About hitting you on the head again.” 

“Yes. I remember,” I said, rolling my eyes. 

“It was really stupid,” Gwynnie continued. “I don’t know why I said it. So I 
wanted to say I’m sorry.” 

“Gwynnie, you chased me after school—” I protested. “You came after me 
with a baseball bat and—” 

“No!” she cried, jumping up from the chair. “I was running after you to 
apologize.” 

“Then why were you carrying the bat?” I demanded. 

“I was up next,” she explained. “That’s all.” Her expression changed. “Did 
you really think I was going to hit you on the head again?” 

“Well...” I didn’t want to tell her that was exactly what I thought. She’d tell 



everyone in school that I was afraid of her. Everyone would have a really good 
laugh about what a ’fraidy cat Marco is. How I ran away from someone who 
only wanted to apologize. 

Gwynnie locked her green eyes on me. “You know, I feel bad about 
everything, Marco,” she said softly. “I keep picturing you the other afternoon 
when I swung the bat and hit you. I keep picturing the way you dropped to your 
knees, screaming.” 

She sighed. “I—I was so scared. You just lay there on the grass. You didn’t 
move. I—I thought...” She glanced away. 

“I’m okay,” I told her. “I’m fine now. Really.” 

“Well, I never got a chance to say I’m sorry,” Gwynnie replied. “So here I 
am.” She raised her eyes to me. “You’re really okay?” 

I nodded. Then I remembered Keith. 

“I have one big problem,” I told Gwynnie. “This boy. He keeps following 
me. Calling me. Showing up in my room.” 

Her green eyes grew wide with surprise. “A boy? In your room?” 

I nodded. “Look. His face—it’s on the computer screen!” I pointed. “I was 
working on the writing assignment. I answered the phone. And when I came 
back, my writing was gone. And his face stared out at me on the screen. Look!” 

Gwynnie gazed at the monitor. When she turned back to me, her expression 
was confused. 

“Marco,” she said, staring hard at me. “Your computer isn’t turned on!” 



16 


“No way!” I cried. 

I turned to the monitor. Black. The screen was black. 

No face. No words. 

Gwynnie walked across the room and leaned against the window ledge. She 
crossed her arms in front of her. “That was a joke—right?” she demanded. 

I couldn’t take my eyes from the screen. Had I imagined the face? No! I 
saw it there. 

I’m not crazy! I told myself. 

“He did it!” I told Gwynnie, my voice shaking. “Keith. His name is Keith. 
He—he’s playing tricks on me. He’s haunting me!” 

Gwynnie eyed me suspiciously. “Marco, when did you see him for the first 
time? After the hit on the head—right?” 

“I don’t care!” I cried. “He’s here, Gwynnie. I saw him. He sat right there. 
Right on my bed. He says he lives in my basement.” 

Gwynnie shook her head. Her dark hair tumbled over her face again. “Calm 
down, Marco. Stop and think about it.” 

“I can describe him,” I insisted breathlessly. “He has black hair. Same color 
as yours. And dark circles around his eyes. And a real serious expression.” 

Gwynnie tsk-tsked. “Just think about it,” she repeated. “Why would he be 
here? Why would he be in your basement?” 

“He told me I have to take care of him,” I replied heatedly. “He said I have 
to take care of him for the rest of my life!” 

Gwynnie narrowed her eyes at me. She didn’t say anything. I could see her 
studying me. 

And I could almost read her thoughts: 

Poor Marco. 

He’s totally lost it. 

An idea flashed into my mind. 

“Gwynnie, he’s down there,” I said softly. “Keith is down in the basement. I 
know he is.” 

She still didn’t reply. 



“Come down with me?” I asked. “Please?” 

She bit her bottom lip. 

Gwynnie is a lot braver than I am, I told myself. She’s bigger than I am. 
And she’s meaner and stronger. 

If we find Keith down in the basement, I’ll feel a lot safer if Gwynnie is 
around. 

“This is dumb,” she said finally. “I should get home. I haven’t even started 
the creative writing assignment.” She headed for the door. 

“No. Wait!” I pleaded, hurrying after her. “I’m not crazy, Gwynnie. Come 
down to the basement with me so I can prove it.” 

She stopped at the doorway. “Well...” 

“Please!” I begged again. “He’s down there. We’ll find him. I know we 
will.” And then I added, “You’re not afraid—are you?” 

“Of course not!” Gwynnie snapped. She groaned and tossed up her hands. 
“Okay. Okay. Let’s go down to your basement.” 

I knew that would get her. 

“Come on. Hurry,” Gwynnie urged. “Show me your little friend. Then I’ve 
got to get home.” 

I led the way to the basement stairs. Then I pulled open the door and 
clicked on the light. 

I peered down the wooden stairway. Nothing to see down there. 

But I felt a chill of fear, anyway. 

“You go first,” I told Gwynnie. 



17 


Our sneakers thudded on the wooden steps. The air grew colder as we made our 
way down. Mom is always complaining that we have no heat in the basement. 

Gwynnie led the way, moving quickly. My hand gripping the banister, I 
hurried to stay close to her. 

At the bottom of the stairs, I stopped short to keep from bumping into her. 
We both glanced around the main room. 

A ceiling light had gone out. Half the room was hidden in deep shadows. I 
heard the DRIP DRIP DRIP of a faucet, coming from the laundry room at the far 
wall. 

The sound of heavy breathing made me gasp. Then I realized the sound 
came from Gwynnie. 

Gwynnie took a few steps into the room. Then she cupped her hands around 
her mouth and shouted, “Hey, boy—are you down here?” 

I crept up beside her. And listened. 

No reply. 

“Keith?” Gwynnie shouted. “Keith? Where are you?” 

I shuddered. He was down here. I knew he was. Why wasn’t Gwynnie 
afraid? 

A sudden sound made me jump. My eyes moved up to the ceiling. Gusts of 
wind were rattling the basement windows. 

I stopped to listen to another strange sound. A mouse? 

No. Just Gwynnie’s sneakers squeaking over the linoleum floor. 

We moved deeper into the room. I stepped up to the pool table. I peered 
underneath. 

No one under there. 

Gwynnie pulled open the pantry door beneath the stairwell. She clicked on 
the light and searched the shelves. 

She closed the door and turned to me. “I’m starting to feel a little silly, 
Marco.” 

“He’s down here,” I insisted, my voice just above a whisper. “He says he 
lives down here. I know he’s here.” 

Gwynnie sighed. “I’ll give it a few more minutes. Then I’m out of here.” 



“Let’s search over here,” I said. “By the furnace.” 

We made our way across the room. The furnace stood in the dark part of the 
room. It rose up in front of us like some kind of gigantic creature. 

“Keith?” Gwynnie called. “Keith—where are you hiding? Come out, come 
out—wherever you are!” 

Her voice echoed off the dark walls. Outside, the wind howled, rattling the 
windows. 

“Hey—wait up!” I whispered. I didn’t want Gwynnie to get too far ahead of 
me. 

She pulled open an old clothes cabinet. “Keith—are you in there?” 

The smell of mothballs floated out. Gwynnie slammed the closet door shut. 

“Keith? Don’t be shy, Keith!” she called. 

We peered behind the furnace. No one hiding back there. 

“The laundry room is the only room we haven’t searched,” I told her. 

“I’ll bet he’s hiding in the dryer,” Gwynnie teased. 

I knew she wasn’t taking me seriously. But I didn’t care. I was glad to have 
her down there with me. I never could have searched the basement on my own. 

I followed her toward the laundry room against the wall. We were halfway 
across the floor when she stopped suddenly. 

“Oh, wow!” she exclaimed. “There he is! I see him!” 



18 


“Huh?” My heart leaped. I let out a gasp and spun around. 

And stared at my mom’s old clothing dummy. 

Gwynnie laughed. “Ooops. A little mistake!” 

My whole body was shaking. “You’re not funny!” I managed to choke out. 
I tried to punch her. But she dodged away from me, laughing hard. 

“Marco, give up,” she said, shaking her head. “I know you’re trying to 
scare me with this phony Keith story. But it just isn’t scary enough. I know 
there’s no one down here.” 

“But—but—but—” I sputtered. “You mean you didn’t believe me for one 
second?” 

“Of course not,” Gwynnie replied. “Who would believe a story like that?” 

“And you thought I was just trying to pay you back for hitting me on the 
head?” I asked shrilly. 

She nodded. “You want to go to school tomorrow and tell everyone how 
you scared me,” Gwynnie accused. 

“No. You’re wrong. Listen to me—” I pleaded. 

“No way,” she interrupted. She turned and headed toward the stairs. 

“Gwynnie, listen—!” I begged, chasing after her. 

She stopped at the bottom of the stairs and turned back to me. “You can’t 
scare me, Marco,” she said. Her eyes caught the light from the stairwell. A 
strange smile spread over her face. 

“You can’t scare me,” she repeated. “I’ll show you why.” 

“Excuse me?” I didn’t understand. “If you’d only listen to me...” 

“I’ll show you something,” Gwynnie said. 

She placed both hands on the wooden banister. Then she opened her mouth. 
Wide. 

Wider. 

Her mouth stretched open. Wider... wider. 

Until the rest of her face disappeared behind her open mouth. 

Her tongue plopped heavily over her chin. 

And then something pink began to pour out. 



Something pink and glistening wet rolled out from the gaping mouth. 

More... more... swelling as it poured out. 

At first, I thought she had a big gob of bubblegum in there. But as the pink 
gunk flowed up from her throat, the mouth pulled open even further, and her 
head disappeared behind it. 

And I realized... 

I realized... 

I realized I wasn’t staring at bubblegum. 

I was staring at Gwynnie’s insides! 

I saw yellow organs clinging to the glistening pink flesh. Something long 
and gray twisted out of her mouth, wrapped around itself. 

Dark purple lungs slid over the drooping tongue. 

And then her red heart—so red, so startlingly red—plopped from her open 
mouth, throbbing, throbbing steadily, throbbing wetly. 

“Ohhhhh.” I uttered a long moan of horror. 

But I couldn’t turn away. Couldn’t take my eyes off Gwynnie as her insides 
poured from her mouth. 

I stood there. Stood there and stared in amazement and cold horror at the 
pulsing, quivering organs clinging to the oozing pink flesh. 

Stood there watching Gwynnie—until she had turned completely inside out. 

And then I opened my mouth in an endless scream. 



19 


My scream rose like a shrill siren. 

Gwynnie—inside out Gwynnie—quivered in front of me, quivered and 
pulsed. 

The sound of my scream seemed to make her quiver harder, quiver like a 
mound of pink and yellow Jell-O. 

And as I screamed, a white light flashed around us. So bright, I closed my 
eyes and still saw it. 

Such a bright white, blinding white. 

My scream cut through the whiteness. Gwynnie vanished inside it. The 
basement vanished too. 

I sank into the white, into the shrill wail of my own cry. 

And when I opened my eyes, I stared up at a white ceiling. A white ceiling 
light. White curtains over a half-open window, revealing gray clouds. 

My throat ached. I cut off my scream. 

I blinked into the new whiteness. 

And Mom’s face floated into view. 

“Marco? Are you waking up?” she asked softly. 

Her lipstick was smeared. Her eyes were bloodshot. I saw dried tear tracks 
on her pale cheeks. 

“Waking up?” I choked out, my voice hoarse and sleep-clogged. 

“You’re going to be okay,” Mom said, patting my chest under the blanket. 

I glanced around. I was lying on my back in a bed. In a small room. A 
hospital room. 

“You had a bad hit on the head, Marco,” Mom said. “The ambulance rushed 
you here, to the hospital. You’ve been out for nearly an hour.” 

“Huh? I’ve been out?” I whispered. “You mean asleep?” 

Mom nodded. 

“But I was down in the basement,” I protested. “Gwynnie and I were 
searching for the boy.” 

Mom’s expression turned fearful. Her chin trembled. “Boy? What boy?” 

“Keith,” I told her. “The boy who says he lives in our basement.” 



“Marco, you were dreaming,” Mom said. 

“It—it was so frightening,” I sighed. 

“From your hit on the head,” Mom explained. “You were out cold. It must 
have given you terrible nightmares.” 

“You mean I haven’t been home?” I cried. “I haven’t been in school?” 

Mom eyed me carefully, studying me. “No. You’ve been in this hospital bed 
ever since you were hit.” 

She shook her head. “I warned you, Marco. I told you not to play baseball. I 
knew something like this would happen.” 

She kept on talking, but I didn’t listen. 

I was thinking hard. And feeling so happy. 

It had all been a dream. Keith living in my basement... Dr. Bailey wanting 
to remove my brain... Gwynnie turning inside out... 

All a wild, frightening dream. 

It never happened. None of it. 

And now it was over. And I was going to be okay. 

I felt so great, I wanted to leap up from the bed. I wanted to shout and cheer 
and jump for joy. 

But then I gazed over Mom’s shoulder to the door. 

And I saw... Gwynnie! 

“Noooo!” I uttered a horrified cry. 

Gwynnie was real. Gwynnie was alive! And she was coming for me, 
hurrying across the room to get me, an evil gleam in her eyes! 



20 


I let out a scream. I struggled to climb up. But the sheet and blanket were tucked 
in too tight. 

I couldn’t move. 

“Mom—stop her!” I pleaded. “Please—don’t let her hurt me!” 

Gwynnie stepped up to the side of the bed, her eyes glowing. Mom put a 
hand on Gwynnie’s shoulder. “Marco, what’s wrong?” Mom demanded. “Why 
are you afraid of your own sister?” 

Sister? 

“No—!” I protested. “She swung the bat. She hit my head. And then—” 

“I did not!” Gwynnie whined. “I wasn’t the one who hit you! Are you 
crazy?” 

Mom tugged Gwynnie back a few steps. “Gwynnie didn’t do it, Marco,” 
Mom said softly. “Gwynnie wasn’t at the playground. Don’t you remember?” 

“That bump on his head messed up his memory,” Gwynnie said. She stared 
hard at me, shaking her head. “Do you remember anything, Marco?” 

“Of course,” I murmured. 

But I suddenly felt dizzy. As if my brain were spinning inside my head. I 
felt so confused. I didn’t know what I remembered and what I’d forgotten. 

“How much is four and four?” Gwynnie demanded. 

“Gwynnie, give Marco a break,” Mom scolded. She turned back to me. 
“You do remember your little sister now—right, Marco?” 

Little sister? 

Gwynnie was twice my size. 

“Yes, I remember her,” I replied. I rolled my eyes. “How could I forget her? 
I guess the horrible dream mixed everything up,” I explained. “In my dream, she 
wasn’t my sister. And she swung the bat that—” 

“Your friend Jeremy swung the bat!” Gwynnie declared. “Don’t you 
remember anything?” 

“Jeremy?” I cried. 

“It will take Marco a little while,” Mom told Gwynnie. “But Dr. Bailey says 
he will be perfectly okay.” 

“But he’ll be stupid,” Gwynnie insisted. 



Mom gasped. “Gwynnie! Why do you say that?” 

Gwynnie giggled. “Because he was stupid before he got hit on the head!” 

I let out a growl. I wanted to jump up and punch Gwynnie. But the sheet 
was too tight. And I felt too weak. 

My head throbbed. Pieces of my dream kept flashing back into my mind. 

Once again, I saw Gwynnie down in the basement, turning inside out. I saw 
her pink and yellow insides quivering like a pile of Jell-O. 

And I saw Keith, sitting on my bed. So calm and relaxed, as if the bedroom 
was his! 

“Mom,” I said, trying to force away the strange, confusing pictures. “There 
is no boy named Keith—is there? I mean, I don’t know a boy named Keith. He 
doesn’t live in our basement—does he?” 

“Of course he does!” Gwynnie cried. 



21 


“Huh?” I stared at her in horror. 

Gwynnie grinned. “The basement is filled with people!” she exclaimed. 
“Dozens of them. They call themselves The Basement Club. They stay down 
there until we all leave. And then they come upstairs and use our stuff.” 

She laughed, as if she had just made up the funniest joke. 

“Stop teasing your brother,” Mom scolded her. “Why are you picking on 
him, Gwynnie? Can’t you see he’s had a rough time?” 

“Sorry,” Gwynnie said to me, still grinning. 

“She’s just nervous,” Mom explained. “She was very worried about you, 
Marco. Really.” 

I settled back on the pillow. “The dream... it seemed so real,” I murmured. 

“Get some rest,” Mom replied tenderly. “You need time to get over this.” 

She waved Gwynnie to the door. “Your sister and I will go out to the 
waiting room and let you get some sleep.” 

“But—when can I go home?” I demanded. 

“Soon,” Mom promised. “As soon as Dr. Bailey checks you out. He said if 
you’re okay, you can come home right away.” 

“Great!” I cried. 

I really wanted to get out of that hospital bed. For one thing, the tight sheets 
were strangling me. And I knew I wouldn’t have such weird, disturbing dreams 
in my own bed. 

“See you later, Marco,” Gwynnie called as she stepped out the door. She 
instantly poked her head back in. “One last question. How much is four and 
four?” 

“Gwynnie—!” Mom shoved Gwynnie down the hall. 

“Nine!” I called after them. 

Gwynnie laughed. “Hey—you got it right!” 

I stared at the doorway for a long time after they left. Then I stared at the 
ceiling for a while, counting the white squares. 

My head throbbed. But I started to feel calmer. The room stopped spinning. 

I shut my eyes, and I guess I fell asleep. 



The next thing I knew, I felt someone gently tapping my shoulder. I opened 
my eyes to find a young doctor in a white lab coat staring down at me. 

“Marco? Are you awake?” he asked softly. Tm Dr. Bailey.” 

He didn’t look anything like the Dr. Bailey in my dream. He had wavy 
blond hair and bright blue eyes. He was young and tanned. He looked like an 
actor—a TV doctor—not a doctor in real life. 

“How are you feeling?” he asked, his voice low and whispery. “A little 
dizzy? Do you have a headache?” 

“A little,” I replied. 

“That’s normal,” he said. “Let me just check you out, Marco. Bet you’re 
ready to go home.” 

“I’m ready,” I declared. 

“Well, let’s see...” Dr. Bailey said, studying my eyes. “Your eyes look nice 
and clear. That’s a very good sign. Open your mouth, please.” 

I opened my mouth. 

The doctor reached in with his right hand. He grabbed my tongue. And 
started to pull it. 

“Hey—!” I tried to protest. But I couldn’t speak. 

His fingers tightened their grip on my tongue. And he pulled harder. 

Stop! You’re hurting me! What are you doing? 

That’s what I wanted to shout. 

But all I could get out was a muffled, “Haaaaaah?” 

Dr. Bailey tugged hard on my tongue. It slid out of my mouth, as long as a 
hot dog. 

I struggled to squirm away. But he held my chest down with one hand while 
he pulled my tongue with the other. 

Pulled... pulled... 

My tongue was a yard long. It drooped down the side of the bed. 

Dr. Bailey reached deeper into my mouth and pulled. 

Pulled out more tongue. More... 

Yard after yard. My tongue curled on the floor, wet and pink. 

I tossed my head back and struggled to breathe. 

As the doctor pulled... pulled more tongue from my open mouth. 

More tongue. More... 

My tongue piled up like an endless wet snake on the floor beside the bed. 

Humming to himself, Dr. Bailey continued to pull. 



It’s a dream, I told myself. Another frightening nightmare. 

I shut my eyes tight and willed myself to wake up, to lift myself from the 
dream. 

Wake up, Marco! Wake up! Wake up! 

But when I opened my eyes, the doctor still hunched beside me, pulling out 
my tongue. Pulling... pulling... 

It wasn’t a dream. 



22 


And then I woke up. 

And stared up at the white squares on the ceiling. 

I pulled myself onto my elbows. Sweat poured down my forehead. My head 
throbbed. 

“Dr. Bailey—?” I choked out. 

Gone. 

Blinking away my confusion, I glanced around the room. The white 
curtains fluttered over the half-open window. A bed against the far wall stood 
empty. 

All alone. 

I was all alone in the hospital room. 

I glanced down at the floor, expecting to see a pink coiled pile of my 
tongue. 

No. The floor was clean. I moved my tongue against my teeth. My normal¬ 
sized tongue. 

I uttered a long, relieved sigh. 

I’m okay, I thought. And I’m awake. I’m finally awake. 

No more disgusting nightmares. 

I heard heavy footsteps in the hall. I turned to the door in time to see a giant 
enter the room! 

The man smiled at me and rubbed his stubbly black beard. He had to be at 
least seven feet tall! He ducked his head as he stepped into the room. He had 
bushy black hair and thick black eyebrows that looked like caterpillars floating 
over his eyeglasses. 

His white lab coat hung loosely over his long body. A stethoscope bobbed 
against his broad chest as he walked. 

“Feeling a little better, Marco?” he asked. “I’m Dr. Bailey.” 

“Uh... are you the real Dr. Bailey?” I blurted out. 

He furrowed his bushy eyebrows. “What do you mean?” 

“Well...” I started. “The other Dr. Bailey... I mean... the Dr. Bailey in my 
dream...” 



He sat down on the edge of the bed. The mattress sank under his weight. He 
studied me with his eyes for a long moment. “Yes, yes. I’m a little troubled by 
these dreams of yours,” he said finally. 

He placed the end of the stethoscope on my chest and listened for a few 
seconds. “Heartbeat is completely normal,” he reported. 

He frowned. “Your mother and your sister are down in the hospital 
cafeteria. They’ll be up in a minute. They told me about your dreams,” he said 
quietly. “Your mom said you were a little confused by them. And frightened.” 

I nodded. “They were scary. And they seemed so real. The colors were so 
real. And...” I didn’t know what else to say. 

Dr. Bailey nodded. “I want to keep you here one more night, Marco,” he 
said, tucking the stethoscope under his lab coat. “Your X rays are okay. I 
couldn’t find any skull damage. The skin is bruised. But your head should heal 
up nicely.” 

“That’s great!” I interrupted. 

He nodded again. “Yes. But I’m a little troubled by all these strange dreams 
you’ve been having.” 

“So I have to stay here one more night?” I asked, disappointed. 

He climbed to his feet. Standing so close to me, he appeared to be a mile 

high! 

“Yes. One more night,” he replied, scribbling some notes on a clipboard. 
“I’ll check back with you in the morning. I’m pretty sure you will be able to 
leave then.” 

“Thank you, doctor,” I said in a tiny voice. I couldn’t hide how upset I felt. 
I really wanted to get out of that hospital. 

Dr. Bailey turned at the door. “Oh. I almost forgot,” he said, shaking his 
head. 

He pulled a square envelope from the pocket of his lab coat. “This came for 
you, Marco. A few minutes ago. While your mom and sister were downstairs. I 
almost forgot to deliver it.” 

He handed the envelope to me. “Get some rest,” he instructed. “I’ll do my 
best to get you out of here in the morning.” 

I thanked him again. I watched him duck his head as he made his way out 
into the hall. Then I examined the envelope. It said FOR MARCO on the 
outside, in a handwriting I didn’t recognize. 

I tore the envelope open and pulled out a note. The handwriting was small 



and very sloppy. I squinted hard at it and read: 


Dear Marco, 

Please hurry home. It’s time for you to start taking care of me. 
I’m waiting for you in the basement. 

Keith 



23 


A few minutes later, Mom and Gwynnie walked into the room. 

“We brought you a treat,” Gwynnie announced. She handed me a Milky 
Way bar, my favorite. 

“The nurse said you can eat whatever you want,” Mom said. She stepped up 
to the bed. “Was the doctor here? What did he say?” 

“He said I can probably go home in the morning,” I told her. “But, Mom 

_ ?” 

She narrowed her eyes at me. 

“Aren’t you going to eat the candy bar?” Gwynnie asked. 

“Later,” I replied sharply. 

“But it’s your favorite!” Gwynnie insisted. 

I knew what she wanted. She wanted a bite! 

I ignored her and gazed up at my mother. “Mom, Dr. Bailey gave me this 
letter. I don’t understand where it came from. It’s from that boy Keith. You 
know. The one in my dream. But that’s impossible. How—?” 

“What letter?” Mom interrupted. “Show it to me, Marco. Let me read it.” 

I reached for the letter. I had set it down on top of the blanket. 

No. Not there. 

I fumbled around the bed for it. 

No. 

I sat up and searched. Had it fallen on the floor? 

No. I didn’t see it there. 

I lifted the pillow and peered underneath. I tugged up the sheet and blanket 
and searched in the bed. 

“That’s so weird,” I murmured, shaking my head. “I had it in my hand. And 
I just set it down a minute ago.” 

Mom and Gwynnie exchanged glances. 

“No. Really!” I protested. 

“Maybe you should get back into bed,” Mom said. “I don’t think Dr. Bailey 
wants you walking around yet.” 

“But I’ve got to find that letter,” I insisted. 



“Your candy bar is melting,” Gwynnie said. 

“I don’t care about the stupid candy bar!” I screamed. “I got a letter from 
that boy who says he lives in our basement. And I want to prove it to you!” 

“Stop screaming, Marco,” Mom scolded. “You’re not thinking clearly. You 
need to rest.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

I turned to the door as Dr. Bailey poked his head in. “There you are!” he 
smiled. “Marco, are you out of bed already? Feeling stronger, huh?” 

“Dr. Bailey—tell them!” I cried. “You just brought me a letter—right? Tell 
them about the letter you brought me.” 

Dr. Bailey’s heavy black eyebrows rose up to his forehead. “Letter?” he 
asked. “What letter?” 



24 


That night, I tried not to fall asleep. I didn’t want any more nightmares. I didn’t 
want to see that boy Keith again. And I didn’t want to see my sister or anyone 
else opening their mouth and turning inside out. 

I kept my eyes wide open and stared at the gray sky out the window. And 
listened to the sounds of the hospital outside my room. 

But I fell asleep, anyway. And slept hard, without a single dream. 

When I awoke the next morning, Mom and Gwynnie were already in my 
room. Mom was packing my bag. 

I groaned and pulled myself up on one elbow. 

“Wake up, Sleeping Beauty,” Mom said cheerfully. “Dr. Bailey says you 
can go home this morning.” 

“Great!” I cried, my voice still hoarse from sleep. My head ached. My hand 
shot up to the bandage on the side of my head. 

“Don’t touch it,” Mom warned. “Your head will hurt for a while. But you’re 
okay.” 

I lowered my legs to the floor. I felt a little dizzy, but I stood up. 

“Dr. Bailey says you can go back to school as soon as you feel strong 
enough,” Mom said. 

“You’re so lucky!” Gwynnie exclaimed. “You missed all the tests—and a 
really bad-news assembly with bagpipe players.” 

“Get dressed,” Mom instructed. 

She didn’t have to tell me twice. I practically dove into my clothes. 

I was so happy to be going home, I wanted to sing and dance. I even 
hugged Gwynnie, for the first time in my life! “I’m sorry I dreamed you weren’t 
my sister,” I told her. 

“Yuck! Don’t hug me again,” Gwynnie replied, making a face. “You’re 
scaring me, Marco. You’d better start acting normal!” 

“Don’t worry,” I told her. “I’ll be normal. As soon as we get home, I’ll be 
as normal as a person can be! ” 

And I meant it. 

When we arrived home, I kissed the front door! I was so happy. I’d only 
been away for two days—but it seemed like two years! 



Mom got to work in the kitchen, making a homemade pizza. My favorite 
food. Mom puts lots of cheese on her pizza, and slices of hot dogs instead of 
pepperoni. 

She usually makes a pizza only on weekends. But today was a special day, a 
day to celebrate. 

Jeremy came over that afternoon. He apologized for hitting me in the head 
with the bat. 

I told him I didn’t even remember how it happened. 

“I’m not sure, either,” Jeremy replied. “You were standing behind me. I 
didn’t see you there at all. It was my turn at bat. I took a practice swing, and... 
BAM.” 

I struggled to remember. But it didn’t come back to me. 

“I’m really sorry, Marco,” Jeremy apologized again. 

“It wasn’t your fault,” I told him. “Don’t blame yourself.” 

“Maybe you knocked some sense into him!” Gwynnie replied from the den 

door. 

“Get out of here, Gwynnie!” I shouted. “What are you doing out there in the 
hall? Spying on us?” 

“Why would I spy on you?” she shot back. “You’re too boring!” 

I think Gwynnie has a cmsh on Jeremy. She’s always showing off when he 
comes over. 

“Mom rented some movies. We’re going to watch one now,” I called to her. 
“Are you going to watch it with us?” 

“Bor-ring!” she replied. But she plopped down on the arm of the couch, 
anyway. She crossed her arms in front of her chest. “What movie?” 

I pulled out an Indiana Jones movie I’d seen about ten times. “This one is 
cool,” I said. “Let’s watch it again.” 

Mom usually doesn’t let us watch movies in the middle of the afternoon. 
She says it’s bad for our eyes. 

But today was a special day. 

Homemade pizza and an Indiana Jones movie. It doesn’t get much better 
than that—right? 

The three of us sat in the den, eating slice after slice and watching the 
movie. Mom kept interrupting every few minutes to ask how I felt. 

Each time, I told her, “Fine.” 

But near the end of the movie, my head started to ache. I felt tired and a 



little shaky. 

I decided I’d better take a nap. I said good-bye to Jeremy and told him I’d 
call him later to go over our homework. Then I went up to my room. 

With a weary sigh, I sat down on the bed and pulled off my sneakers. Then 
I tugged down the covers. 

I started to climb into bed—but I suddenly had the strange feeling I was 
being watched. 

I turned away from the bed—and saw a boy leaning in the doorway. 

“Jeremy—?” I called out. 

No. As he stepped into the room, I recognized him. 

Keith. 



25 


I blinked once. 

Twice. 

Trying to make him disappear. 

But he crossed the room steadily, slowly, his dark eyes locked on me. 

“No way!” I cried, jumping to my feet. “You can’t be here! I dreamed you!” 
“I know,” he replied calmly. 

“I dreamed you!” I shouted. “And I’m awake now. I know I’m awake!” 

I pinched my arm. I scratched my cheek. 

“Ow!” It hurt. 

I was awake. Definitely awake. Not dreaming. 

“You can’t be here, Keith!” I repeated, my knees shaking, my whole body 
trembling. “No way you can be here. I’m awake now. And you don’t exist!” 

Keith stopped a few feet in front of me. “Sure, I do,” he replied. A smile 
spread over his solemn face. His dark eyes flashed. “I live in your basement, 
Marco. You know that. I told you that before.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. “You are not real. You were only in my dreams!” 
Still smiling, Keith shook his head. “I’m real. Touch me.” He held out his 

arm. 

I hesitated. Then I reached out slowly... slowly... and squeezed his hand. 
“Hey—!” I jumped back. He was real! 

He laughed. “I told you.” 

“But in my dreams...” I started. 

“I used your dreams,” Keith explained. “I communicated with you in your 
dreams. I put myself in your dreams.” 

“Wh-why?” I stammered. 

His smile faded. “I wanted you to know that I was here. Waiting for you.” 

I didn’t like the cruel expression on his face. I didn’t like the way he was 
talking. 

He frightened me. 

He was trying to frighten me, I suddenly realized. 

My heart thudded in my chest. The side of my head began to throb. 



I took a step back. My legs hit the edge of my mattress. And I tumbled onto 
my back on the bed. 

Keith quickly stepped up in front of me, blocking my way, keeping me 
from climbing to my feet. 

“I’ve been waiting for you, Marco,” he repeated, his eyes hard and cold. 
“Because you’re going to take care of me. For the rest of your life.” 

“No—!” I shouted. 

I squirmed to the side and tried to jump up. 

But he was too fast for me. He moved quickly to block me. 

I stared up at him in fright. “No. No way!” I repeated shrilly. 

“You’re going to do whatever I say, Marco,” Keith insisted. He leaned over 
me, threatening me. 

“Go away! You don’t belong here! You’re frightening me!” I blurted out. 

“Get used to it!” he hissed. He leaned closer, so close his face was nearly 
touching mine. 

“Get used to it, Marco,” he said through clenched teeth. “You have no 
choice. I’m here. I’m real. I live in your basement. You have to take care of me 
now. You have to take care of everything I need.” 

“Nooooo!” I let out a horrified howl. 

And spun out from under him. 

I dropped to the floor on my knees. Then I scrambled past him and jumped 
to my feet. 

He whirled around, and I saw the anger in his dark eyes. He uttered a fierce 
growl. 

“Where are you going, Marco?” he demanded. 

He didn’t wait for an answer. 

He pounced. Like an attacking animal. 

I dodged away from him. Then I staggered backwards to my desk. 

If only I could get to the bedroom door. 

But he hunkered in the middle of the room now, panting like a wild 
creature, his eyes blazing. 

Blocking my path. 

With another low growl, he started toward me again. 

I searched the room. Searched for a way to escape. 

Searched for a weapon. Something to keep him away. 

“You can’t get away from me, Marco,” he cried. “You’re going to take care 



of me—forever!” 

He dove for me again. 

I leaned back against the desk. My hand tightened around a paperweight. A 
big, heavy stone owl that Gwynnie had given me for my last birthday. 

As Keith leaped, I swung my fist with the owl paperweight. 

And slammed Keith in the head with it. 

His dark eyes bulged in shock. 

His mouth dropped open, but no sound came out. 

He slumped to the floor. Collapsed in a heap. And didn’t move. 

“Keith—?” I called down in a tiny, quivery voice. “Keith?” 

He didn’t move. His eyes stared blankly up at the ceiling. 

“Keith—?” 

I let the heavy stone owl drop to the floor. And then I crouched down beside 
the still body. 

“Keith? Keith—?” 

“Oh, noooo,” I moaned. “What have I done?” 



26 


“Keith—?” 

I shook his shoulders. His head bounced on the carpet. His eyes stared up at 
me glassily. They didn’t blink. 

“Nooooo!” I let out another terrified moan. And jumped to my feet. 

The room spun around me. The floor tilted and bobbed. My head throbbed. 

I stumbled to the door. I planned to call Mom for help. 

But I turned back before I reached the doorway. 

And saw Keith start to change. 

“Huh?” I uttered a gasp. And stared down at him in shock and horror. 

His features—his eyes, his nose, his mouth—melted into the flesh of his 
face. Then his head slid into his neck. 

Like a turtle pulling into its shell, Keith’s head disappeared into his 
shoulders. His arms and legs slid into the trunk of his body. 

His clothes fell away. 

The skin on his body glimmered and turned milky, like the skin of a snail or 
a slug. 

As I gaped in shock, the body began to wriggle across the carpet. It flopped 
wetly, heavily toward me. 

I gasped as I saw the thick trail of yellow slime it left on the carpet behind 
it. 

And then, before I could force my trembling legs to move, the spongy, wet 
creature rose up. 

Stretched... 

And wrapped itself around my waist. 

“Unnnnnh.” I let out a sick groan of disgust. Its sour aroma shot up to my 
nostrils, choking me. Its sticky wet flesh tightened around me. 

I opened my mouth to scream for help. 

But it choked off my air. 

The odor... so foul and heavy. Wave after wave of it washed over me like 
some kind of poison gas. 

I tried to kick the creature. 



But my sneakers sank into the soft, gooey slime. 

I punched with both fists. And tried butting it with my head. 

My punches made wet SQUISH SQUISH sounds as my hands disappeared 
into the spongy body. 

It was like battling a slimy, sticky sponge. 

I tried wrestling it. Bending it back. Back... 

But the foul-smelling goo stretched. 

Stretched over me. Over my face. 

So warm and sticky. Pulsing. 

It wrapped around my head. 

Covered my face. Covered my nose. 

The warm, sticky slime slid up my nostrils. 

I—I can’t breathe! I realized. 

I’m going to suffocate inside this thing! 



27 


I knew I didn’t have much time to free myself. With a burst of strength, I swung 
my head back. 

But the warm goo moved with me. Pressed tighter against my face. I could 
feel the sticky slime climbing up my nose, into my mouth. 

I had to get help. But how? 

I stumbled forward. Could I walk? Could I push the heaving, spongy 
creature with me? 

If I could get downstairs... 

My heart pounding, I forced myself forward. 

Butting against the heavy blob, pushing, digging my knees into its flesh as I 
struggled to move. 

Yes! I took a step. Then another. 

Was I through the bedroom door? 

I stared through the creature’s milky flesh. Stared right through its thick 
body. 

The house was a shadowy blur on the other side. 

I couldn’t breathe. My chest began to burn. I couldn’t hold my breath much 
longer. 

I had to keep going! 

Pushing, butting it, forcing my legs to take another step... another step... I 
made my way down the hall with the creature over me. 

Yes. Yes. Every step taking me closer to help. 

Yes... 

And then suddenly my feet lifted off the floor. I tumbled forward. 

Falling! I was falling down the stairs. 

The sticky creature bounced beneath me, cushioning me like a foam rubber 
pillow. 

Down... all the way down the stairs. 

We bounced hard together at the bottom. 

My head jerked free from the sticky goo. 

I gasped in a mouthful of air. So cool and sweet. My lungs about to 



explode. 

I sucked in another long breath. 

And then the slime covered my face again. 

I tried to roll free. But it stuck to the front of my body, wrapping itself 
tightly around me again. 

I kicked off from the wall. Bounced forward. 

Through the hall. Into the kitchen. 

Mom—where are you? My desperate question. 

Mom—are you home? Don’t you hear me? 

The creature clung to my face, to my chest. Its foul odor swept over me. A 
wave of dizziness made me slump to my knees. 

No! 

I forced myself up, carrying the weight of the spongy wet creature. 

Across the kitchen. Peering through its glassy body. 

Up to the kitchen counter. 

And slammed it into the sharp counter edge. 

I backed up—and pushed forward again. As hard as I could. 

SLAM! 

I drove the slimy creature into the edge of the counter. 

Again. Again. 

Pushing with all my strength. Then backing up and shooting forward again. 
SLAM! SLAM! 

Its body made a sharp squishy sound with each blow. 

But it clung to me tightly, clung to my face, shutting off my air. Clung to 
me until I could feel my strength fade away. 

One more try. One more slam into the counter. 

I shot forward as hard as I could. 

I heard a loud SPLAlAAT. 

And to my shock, the spongy warm goo fell off my face. 

Dropped from my chest. Dropped to the floor with a heavy PLOP. 

Gasping, sucking in air, panting so hard, my chest ached, I stared down. 

And saw two of the milky slime creatures. 

I had cut it in two. 

The two halves throbbed wetly on the kitchen linoleum. They bobbed 
helplessly like fat insects on their backs. 



“Mom —” I choked out. In only a whisper. 

“Mom... ” No sound. I couldn’t force out a sound. 

I reached my fingers into my throat—and pulled out a thick chunk of slimy 
goo. Gagging, I heaved it into the sink. 

“Mom—!” 

Where was she? 

I heard a voice from somewhere in the house. From the den? 

“Mom?” 

Was she talking on the phone? 

Couldn’t she hear me battering the slime creature against the counter? 
Couldn’t she hear me calling to her? 

“Mom—?” 

I staggered toward the door. 

But I took only a step. 

Before I could move farther, I felt something tighten around the legs of my 
jeans. 

“Ohhhh!” I lowered my gaze—and saw both halves of the spongy slime 
creature wrapping around me. 

I kicked out one leg. Then the other. But they clung tightly. And stretched. 
Two of them now. Spreading their sticky, warm bodies up my jeans, up the 
front of my shirt. 

I grabbed at them with both hands. And pulled. 

But my hands slid off their shimmering wet flesh. 

“Mom—! Gwynnie—! Somebody—help!” 

They swept over my face. Two of them. Two of them now. 

So heavy. 

I fell to my knees. Then sank onto my back. 

So heavy... the two of them were weighing me down. 

As I thrashed and slashed at them, squirming and kicking, they melted. 
Melted back into one. 

And spread around me. Pressing me inside. 

Until I was trapped inside. 

No air left... no air. 

And then, staring helplessly through the thick slime, I saw something move 
across the kitchen. 



Someone moving quickly. A blur of color. 

Mom? 

Was she in time? 

Could she pull me out of this disgusting creature? 

I gazed up at her from inside the thick, milky body. 

Hurry, Mom. 

I can’t breathe. 

Don’t you see me here, trapped inside this goo? 

Hurry. 

Staring hard at the blur of color, I saw her run up to the creature. Saw her 
stare down, hands raised to the sides of her face. 

Pull me out, Mom! I urged silently. 

Pull me out — now! I pleaded. 

But, no. 

She just stood there. 

Stood there and watched as my last bit of breath escaped my lungs. 



28 


“Get up, Marco,” Mom ordered. She lowered her hands and pressed them 
against her waist. 

“Get up, Marco,” she repeated sternly. “What are you doing on the floor?” 
“Huh?” I gasped. “Mom—help! I’m trapped inside this thing! I can’t 
breathe!” 

She stared down at me, frowning and shaking her head. “Marco, this really 
isn’t the time for dumb games. Will you please get up off the floor?” 

Games ? 

“Don’t you see?” I cried. “Keith’s head disappeared, and he turned into a 
big hunk of slime. I tried to get away, but he swallowed me and—” 

She turned away from me and walked to the sink. I heard the water start to 

mn. 

“Mom—?” 

“I’m starting to worry about you, Marco,” Mom said in a low, steady voice. 
“You’re not making any sense. Now, get up. I don’t want you rolling on the floor 
like a baby!” 

I sat up and gazed around. 

“Hey—!” I let out a startled cry. 

No slime creature. 

I rubbed the floor with both hands. The floor was perfectly dry. 

I’m having another dream, I told myself. 

The glob of slime wasn’t real. Our wrestling match down the stairs didn’t 
happen. The whole thing was another disgusting dream. 

I’m not sitting on the floor in the kitchen. I’m asleep in my bed, dreaming 

this. 

And now I’m going to wake up and end it. 

Wake up! 

Wake up, Marco! I ordered myself. 

I climbed to my feet. Mom was at the sink, drinking a tall glass of water. 
Wake up, Marco! 

If this was a dream, why couldn’t I escape from it? 



I turned—and slammed my forehead into a cabinet. 

“Owww!” The pain exploded in my head, shot down my neck, my back. 

“I’m not dreaming,” I murmured out loud. 

Mom turned from the sink. “What did you say?” 

“I’m not dreaming,” I repeated, feeling dazed. 

“At least you are standing up,” Mom replied. She studied me. “Does your 
head hurt, Marco?” 

Yes. It hurt because I slammed it into a cabinet. 

But I said, “No. I’m fine, Mom.” 

And then I ran out of the kitchen. I had to get out of there. I had to think. I 
had to be alone and figure this out. 

“Marco—?” Mom called after me. 

But I didn’t turn back. I ran up the stairs and into my room. And I slammed 
the bedroom door behind me. 

“Marco, take it easy,” a voice said. 

I gasped and raised my eyes to the bed. Keith sat cross-legged on the 
blanket, the pillow between his hands. 

“Sit down,” he said, motioning to my desk chair. “Take a deep breath. 
Relax. We’re going to spend a long time together. The rest of your life.” 



29 


“Am I dreaming?” I asked in a tiny voice. 

Keith didn’t reply. He pointed to the chair. “Sit down,” he ordered. 

I glanced at the door. I thought about escaping. 

But I suddenly felt so tired, so totally weak and weary. 

My legs started to give way. My whole body trembled. 

“I’m sooooo tired,” I moaned. I turned back to Keith. “You win,” I 
murmured. “You’ve beaten me.” 

He smiled and pointed again to the chair. 

I slumped into it with a long sigh. “I can’t fight you,” I told him wearily. “I 
don’t know if I’m dreaming or awake. And I don’t have the strength to find out.” 

His smile grew wider. A victory smile, I guess. His dark eyes flashed. 

“You win,” I repeated sadly. “I’ll do whatever you want.” 

He jumped to his feet and crossed the room. Then he patted me on the 
shoulder, as if I were his puppy dog. “Smart boy,” he said. 

He stood in front of me and crossed his arms. His grin was frozen on his 
face. “I knew you’d see it my way,” he said. “Because you are a very smart boy, 
Marco.” 

I lowered my head. I couldn’t stand seeing that sick grin on his face. 

“I know you will take very good care of me,” Keith continued. “I know you 
will do whatever I tell you to. For as long as you live.” 

He suddenly spun away and started to the door. 

“Where are you going?” I demanded weakly. 

“I’m going down to the basement,” he replied. “Where I live. And do you 
know what I’m going to do?” 

“No,” I choked out. 

“Guess,” he demanded. 

“I can’t guess,” I snapped. “Give me a break.” 

“I’m going down to the basement and make a list of all the things you can 
do for me right away,” Keith said. “You wait here, Marco. When I finish my list, 
I will come back and we can go over it together.” 

“Right,” I muttered under my breath. I rolled my eyes. 



Was he serious about this? Did he really expect me to be his slave— 
forever? 

He stopped at the door and turned back to me. 

“Before I go, there’s just one thing I want to show you,” he said. 

He took a few steps back into the room. Then he opened his mouth wide. 

Shiny pink stuff poured out of his mouth. For a second, I thought he was 
blowing a bubblegum bubble. 

But I quickly realized what was happening. 

His glistening, wet insides poured out of his mouth. Yellow organs clung to 
the pink flesh. His purple heart plopped out from between his teeth, pulsing 
inside a thick web of blue ropelike veins. 

I stared in horror, watching him turn inside out. 

Then I started to scream. 

And Keith opened his mouth—teeth on the outside—and he screamed too. 



30 


I opened my eyes and blinked. My eyes were dry and caked. My mouth felt as 
dry as cotton. 

I must have been sleeping a long time, I told myself. 

Still lying fiat, I stretched my arms out. The muscles ached. 

My head ached. 

With a groan, I lifted my head off the pillow. Then I raised myself up onto 
both elbows. 

“Whoa...” I murmured. The basement slowly came into focus. I felt so 
dizzy... dizzy and weak. 

“Keith—you’re awake!” 

I heard Mom’s voice. And then she popped into view. 

I opened my mouth to greet her, but only coughed. I cleared my throat. 

“You’re finally awake, Keith,” Mom said. “I’ve been waiting for so long.” 

I shook my head hard, trying to shake away my confusion. I glanced 
around, struggling to focus my eyes. 

Yes. Here I was. Safe and sound in the basement, where Mom and I live. 

But what had happened to me? Why had I been asleep for so long? 

Strange pictures floated through my mind. 

“Mom—” I choked out. “Mom, I had such terrible nightmares.” 

She tenderly brushed my hair off my forehead. Her hand felt warm and 
smooth. “What did you dream?” she asked softly. 

“I—I dreamed that Marco was hit in the head with a baseball bat,” I 
stammered. 

Mom bit her bottom lip. “You dreamed about Marco?” she asked, staring 
hard at me. 

I nodded. “Yes. Marco was hit by a bat, and I—” 

“But you were hit by a bat, Keith,” Mom interrupted. “Not Marco.” 

“Everything was turned around in the dream,” I told Mom. “I dreamed that 
I went up to Marco’s room. And I told him who I was. I told him I live in his 
basement.” 

Mom sat down on the edge of my cot. “Then what happened?” she asked. 



“He started fighting me,” I told her. “Marco was horrible to me. He started 
wrestling me. And he pulled me down the stairs. I was so frightened !” 

Mom narrowed her eyes at me sternly. “Keith, I warned you—didn’t I? I 
warned you never to play with humans.” 

“Yes, but—” I started. 

She raised a hand to silence me. 

“Never play with humans, Keith,” Mom scolded. “You’re a monster. You 
should never forget it.” She sighed. “Just because you look exactly like a human 
doesn’t mean you can be friends with the humans.” 

“I know. I know,” I grumbled. 

How many times had I heard this boring lecture before? At least a hundred! 

“I warned you never to play ball with Marco and the other humans,” Mom 
continued. “But you didn’t listen to me. And look—look what happened.” 

I raised my hand and felt the bandage on the side of my head. 

“You were hit in the head with a bat, Keith,” Mom said, her voice 
trembling. “You were badly hurt. It’s no wonder you had terrible nightmares.” 

“Mom, please—” I tried to sit up. 

But she gently forced me back onto my back. “You can’t go up and play 
with the humans,” she continued her lecture. Once Mom starts, it’s impossible to 
stop her. “We have to be so careful, Keith. So careful.” 

“I know! I know!” I cried. “I know the whole lecture, Mom. We’re 
monsters, and we live in Marco and Gwynnie’s basement. And if they ever find 
out we’re down here, they’ll get frightened and chase us away.” 

Mom frowned at me. “I know it’s tempting to go up there and play with 
them,” she said. “But I hope you’ve learned your lesson. You had me so worried 
this time, Keith.” 

“I’m sorry, Mom. I’ll be careful from now on,” I promised. 

That seemed to make her happy. She smiled at me. 

“Okay,” she said. “You need your rest. Turn inside out and get some sleep.” 

“Okay,” I agreed. 

I said good-night to her and watched her disappear to the other side of the 
basement. 

Then I opened my mouth and began to turn inside out. It felt so good to let 
my insides pour out. So clean and refreshing. 

My heart and arteries slid from between my teeth. My stomach was halfway 
out my mouth—when I heard a sound. 



No! 

A sound on the basement stairs! 

I glanced up—and saw Marco standing there. 
Did he see me? 



31 


Staring hard at the figure on the basement stairs, I quickly sucked up my insides. 
My heart and veins slid back into my body. Then I swallowed my lungs. 

Did Marco see me? 

Yes. 

His eyes bulged with shock. His mouth hung open. 

A wave of panic swept over me. A chill ran down my back. 

This is our worst nightmare, I thought. I’ve been caught. I’ve been seen by 
a human. 

Now what? 

I stared back at Marco and waited for him to speak. 

It took him a long time. He gripped the banister and held on to it tightly. He 
squinted across the gray basement at me, squinted hard as if he didn’t believe 
what he was seeing. 

“Who are you?” he asked finally in a small, frightened voice. 

I swallowed hard. 

What should I say? How should I answer? 

I had to think fast. 

“Who are you?” he repeated, a little louder, a little stronger. 

“Uh... you’re dreaming!” I called to him. 

He squinted harder at me. 

“Go back upstairs,” I told him. “It’s just a dream.” 

Would he believe me?

MONSTER BLOOD IV 


Goosebumps - 62 
R.L. Stine 

(An Undead Scan vl.5) 



1 


Evan Ross was thinking about Monster Blood. He thought about Monster Blood 
a lot. 

Evan wished he had never discovered Monster Blood. The sticky, slimy 
green goo had to be the most dangerous substance on Earth. 

Evan knew that as soon as you open a can of Monster Blood, you are 
doomed. The Monster Blood will grow and grow—and suck up everything in its 
path. 

And if you accidentally eat some of the green goo —look out! A tiny chunk 
of Monster Blood had turned Cuddles, the classroom hamster, into a growling 
monster as big as a gorilla! 

And when Evan accidentally swallowed a little bit of it, he shot up taller 
than his house. It was not the happiest day of Evan’s life. It was a day he kept 
trying to forget. 

So why was he thinking about Monster Blood today? 

His green sweater reminded him of Monster Blood. He had begged his 
mom not to make the sweater green. But she had already started knitting it. Too 
late to change colors. 

“You look good in green,” she told him. “It brings out your eyes.” 

“I don’t want to bring out my eyes,” Evan told her. 

He wanted to scream. The yarn she used was greener than the Jolly Green 
Giant! He pictured himself trapped inside a giant green blob of Monster Blood. 

“Wear it to your cousin Kermit’s,” Mrs. Ross instructed him. 

“I don’t need a sweater,” he protested. “Just put it in my suitcase.” 

“Wear it. It’s winter,” she insisted. “It gets cold, even here in Atlanta.” 

“I don’t want to stay at Kermit’s,” Evan grumbled, pulling the sweater over 
his head. Yuck. Green—and itchy. “How long are you and Dad going to be out 
West?” 

“Only nine or ten days,” his mother replied. 

“‘Only’?” Evan cried, struggling into the tight wool sleeves. “I’ll die! Aunt 
Dee’s food is so horrible! She puts that hot sauce on everything. Even 
brownies!” 

“Your aunt does not put hot sauce on brownies,” Mrs. Ross replied sternly. 



“She likes to make spicy food, but—” 

“I’ll explode!” Evan insisted. “And that geeky little creep, Kermit—” 

“Don’t call your cousin a geeky little creep,” Mrs. Ross scolded. 

“Well, he is one—isn’t he?” Evan demanded. 

“That’s beside the point,” his mom said. She pulled the green sweater down 
over Evan’s waist and admired it. “It fits perfectly. And I like that shade of 
green.” 

“I look like a ripe watermelon,” Evan grumbled. 

“Don’t forget, Aunt Dee is paying you to babysit Kermit,” his mom 
reminded him. She handed him his suitcase. “You want to go to sleepaway camp 
this summer, right? Well, you can’t go to camp unless you earn the money to pay 
for it.” 

“I know, I know.” He kissed his mom good-bye. 

“Your dad and I will call you when we get to Tucson,” Mrs. Ross said. 
“Take good care of Kermit. And don’t give Aunt Dee a hard time.” 

“I won’t eat till you get back,” Evan told her. “I’ll probably weigh ten 
pounds.” 

His mom laughed. 

She thinks I’m joking, Evan thought bitterly. 

He hoisted up his backpack and his suitcase and headed for the back door. 
He passed a mirror in the hall and caught a glimpse of himself in the sweater. 
“Sick,” he muttered. “I look like a pickle.” 

“Evan—what did you say?” his mom called. 

“I said, Thanks for the cool sweater!”’ he called back to her. 

A few seconds later, he was walking through backyards, making his way to 
Kermit’s house at the end of the block. Maybe I can hide this sweater 
somewhere, he thought. Maybe I can give it to Kermit as a Christmas present. 

No. Kermit is such a shrimp, the sweater would be down to his knees. 

It was a sunny, crisp winter day. The sweater glowed under the bright 
sunlight. It really did remind Evan of Monster Blood. 

He pictured the slimy green gunk. He pictured heaps and heaps of it, oozing 
over the backyards he passed, bubbling and pulsing. 

As he walked along, Evan had no idea that he was about to have another 
Monster Blood adventure. 

He had no idea that he was about to discover a whole new kind of Monster 
Blood. 



He had no idea that the green Monster Blood was silly kid stuff compared 
to the Monster Blood he was about to find. 



2 


He was nearly to Kermit’s backyard, still thinking about Monster Blood, when a 
dark shadow swept over him. 

He raised his eyes. “Conan—!” he gasped. 

A big hulk of a boy loomed in front of him, hands clenched into big fists, 
blocking Evan’s path. He lived in the house behind Kermit’s. 

His name was Conan Barber. But everyone called him Conan the Barbarian. 
That’s because he was the biggest, meanest kid in Atlanta. 

Conan placed the heel of his size-twelve sneaker on top of Evan’s shoe and 
stomped down hard. 

Evan yelped in pain. “Conan—why’d you do that?” he squealed. 

“Do what?” Conan grunted. He narrowed his cold blue eyes at Evan. 

“You—you crushed my foot!” Evan gasped. 

“Accidents happen,” Conan replied. He snickered. Despite the winter cold, 
he wore a gray muscle shirt and tight black spandex bike shorts. “Here. Let me 
fix it,” he offered. 

And he stomped down with all his might on Evan’s other shoe. 
“Owwwwwww.” Evan took a few painful hops, holding his throbbing foot. 
“What’s the big idea?” 

“Breaking in my new sneakers,” Conan replied, snickering again. 

Evan wanted to wipe the smile off Conan’s face. But how do you wipe the 
smile off a kid who’s built like a Monster Truck ? 

“I’ve got to go,” Evan said quietly. He picked up his suitcase and motioned 
with his head toward Kermit’s house. 

“Hey—!” Conan stared down at the ground. Then he raised his eyes to 
Evan. “Not so fast. You got the bottoms of my sneakers dirty.” 

“Excuse me?” Evan tried to step around Conan. But Conan blocked his 

path. 

“Brand-new sneakers,” Conan grumbled. “And you got the bottoms dirty.” 
“But—but—” Evan sputtered. 

“Oh, well.” Conan sighed. “I’ll let you go this time.” 

Evan’s heart pounded. He breathed a loud sigh of relief. “You will? You’ll 
let me go?” 



Conan nodded. He swept a beefy hand back through his wavy blond hair. 
“Yeah. You caught me in a good mood. Get going.” 

“Th-thanks,” Evan stammered. 

Conan stepped aside. Evan started past him. 

He stopped when he heard a high, shrill voice ring out: “Leave my cousin 
alone!” 

“Oh, noooo,” Evan moaned. He turned to see Kermit running across the 
grass. 

“Leave Evan alone!” Kermit called. He waved a tiny fist at Conan. “Pick on 
somebody your own size!” 

“Kermit—stay out of this! ” Evan shouted. 

Kermit stepped up beside Evan. He was tiny and skinny. He had a pile of 
white-blond hair, a serious face, and round black eyes behind red plastic-framed 
glasses. 

Standing next to Conan, he reminded Evan of a little ant. A bug that Conan 
could easily crush with one tromp of his heavy-duty size twelves. 

“Take a walk, Conan!” Kermit squeaked. “Give Evan a break!” 

Conan’s eyes narrowed to angry slits. “I was going to give Evan a break,” 
he growled. “Until you came along. But now I guess I have to teach you both a 
lesson.” 

He turned and grabbed the front of Evan’s sweater.

“Evan—what happened to your sweater?” Aunt Dee demanded. 

Evan set his suitcase down on the kitchen floor. “Well...” 

The left sleeve of his new sweater was normal length. Conan had taken the 
right sleeve and pulled it... pulled... pulled... until the sleeve dragged on the 
ground. 

“Mom made one sleeve a little too long,” Evan explained. He didn’t want to 
tell his aunt about Conan. 

Why look for trouble? 

Conan promised that next time he’d pull Evan’s right arm until it fit the 
sleeve! 

“Evan picked a fight with Conan,” Kermit reported. 

Aunt Dee’s mouth dropped open. “You shouldn’t start fights, Evan.” 

Evan glared at Kermit. Why was the little creep always trying to get Evan 
in trouble? 

“That boy Conan is big,” Aunt Dee commented. “You really shouldn’t pick 
on him.” 

Good advice, Evan thought bitterly. He lifted the mile-long sweater sleeve, 
then let it drop back to the floor. 

“I’m going to fix Conan,” Kermit declared. “I mixed up a formula that 
grows hair. I’m going to give it to Conan to drink—and he’ll grow hair on his 
tongue. Whenever he tries to talk, he’ll just go, ‘Woffff woffff.’” 

Aunt Dee laughed. “Kermit, stop!” she scolded. “You’re starting to sound 
like a mad scientist!” 

“I am a mad scientist!” Kermit declared proudly. 

He and his mother laughed. But Evan couldn’t even force a smile. 

It’s no joke, Evan thought. Kermit really is a mad scientist. He spends all 
his time down in his lab in the basement mixing bottles of green stuff with 
bottles of blue stuff. 

One afternoon down in the lab, Evan asked Kermit what he was trying to 
discover. “I’m searching for a secret formula,” Kermit replied, pouring a red 
liquid into a test tube. 

“A secret formula that will do what?” Evan had asked. 



“How should I know?” Kermit exclaimed. “It’s secret!” 

Now Evan had to spend the next ten days watching Kermit do his mad 
scientist act. And somehow he had to keep Kermit out of trouble. 

“I’m so glad you’re staying with us,” Aunt Dee told Evan. “I just think it’s 
great that you two cousins are so close.” 

“Yeah. Great,” Evan muttered. 

“Wofff wofff!” Kermit declared, giggling. 

Aunt Dee led the two of them to Kermit’s room at the back of the house. 
Kermit had a foldout bed where Evan would sleep. 

Books and computer disks and papers and science magazines cluttered the 
floor. Evan had to step around a giant plastic model of the solar system to get to 
the dresser. 

Aunt Dee helped him unpack his suitcase. Then she said, “You two run 
along. Go outside or something. I’m going into the kitchen to make dinner.” 

Dinner. The word sent a chill down Evan’s back. 

“What are we having?” he asked. 

“It’s a surprise,” Aunt Dee told him. 

Another chill. 

“I brought my Super-Soaker,” Evan told Kermit. “Let’s go outside and have 
a water fight.” 

Kermit shook his head. “I don’t think so.” He led the way down the 
basement stairs to his science lab. “I want to show you something.” 

Evan stared at the shelves of jars and bottles and test tubes, all brimming 
with mysterious, dangerous materials. “I really don’t feel safe—” he started. 

Something bumped him hard from behind. 

Evan spun around and gazed down at Dogface, Kermit’s huge sheepdog. 
“Stop bumping me!” Evan snapped. 

The dog stuck out his fat tongue and licked Evan’s hand. It left a sticky gob 
of dog drool in his palm. 

“Dogface likes you,” Kermit said. 

“Yuck,” Evan groaned. He searched the lab table for a paper towel to wipe 
off the gunk. 

“I want to try a little test,” Kermit told him. 

“No way!” Evan protested. “No little tests! The last time you tried a little 
test, you turned my nose blue.” 

“That was a mistake,” Kermit replied. “This test is different. This test isn’t 



dangerous.” He raised his right hand. “I swear.” 

“What do I have to do?” Evan asked warily. “Drink something and have my 
tongue grow hair?” 

Kermit shook his head. “No. I’m not ready to test that on a human yet.” 

“Good,” Evan said, relieved. “Let’s get our Super-Soakers and go outside.” 
Evan really wanted to have a water fight. It was the only time he was allowed to 
attack Kermit and get away with it! 

“After the test,” Kermit replied. “The test only takes a minute. I promise.” 

Evan sighed. “Okay. What do I have to do?” 

Kermit held up a black bandanna. “A blindfold,” he said. “Put it on.” 

“Excuse me?” Evan cried, backing away. “Do you really think I’m going to 
let you blindfold me?” 

“It isn’t dangerous!” Kermit insisted in his high, shrill voice. “I just want to 
see if you can identify something. That’s all. It will take a second.” 

Evan argued with his cousin for a while longer. But he ended up slipping on 
the blindfold. “Promise we’ll go outside after this?” 

“Promise,” Kermit replied. He checked to make sure Evan’s blindfold was 
tight. Then he took Evan’s hand and lifted it to a big glass jar. 

He pushed Evan’s hand into the jar. “Tell me what’s in the jar,” Kermit 
instructed. 

Staring at total blackness, Evan wrapped his hand around something warm 
and prickly. 

“Hmmmm...” What is it? he wondered. What could it be? 

As he tried to identify it, he felt something crawl up the back of his hand. It 
slipped under his shirt cuff and crawled up his arm. 

“Huh?” 

He felt a soft, pinching sensation on his hand. 

Something prickled his wrist. 

What is it? What is it? 

He couldn’t take it anymore. He ripped away the blindfold. 

Gazed into the jar. 

And then let out a horrified scream.

“Tarantulas?” Evan shrieked. 

One of the hairy creatures clung to his arm underneath his shirtsleeve. 
Another inched its way across the back of his hand. 

“Don’t scream like that,” Kermit warned, his eyes locked on Evan’s arm. 

“What kind of test is this?” Evan shrieked. “What are you trying to prove?” 

Kermit didn’t look up from the crawling tarantulas. “Someone told me that 
tarantulas won’t bite you,” he explained. “Unless they sense your fear.” 

“Are you kidding me?” Evan cried. “Sense my fear?” 

“Ssshhhh.” Kermit raised a finger to his lips. “Be very calm. Calm... 
calm...” He grinned at Evan. “This is an interesting experiment—isn’t it?” 

“I’ll kill you!” Evan screamed. “I’ll kill you for this, Kermit! When I’m 
finished with you, you’ll go ‘woffff woffff ’ for the rest of your life!” 

“Careful,” Kermit warned softly. “Your arm is shaking. Don’t let them see 
your fear.” 

Evan struggled to steady his arm. One tarantula prickled his wrist. Another 
one stood on the back of his hand. 

“Get these off.” Evan demanded in a frantic whisper. “I’m warning you— 
HEEEEY!” 

Evan felt a hard bump from behind. 

Dogface again! 

Startled, Evan’s hands shot up—and two tarantulas went flying. 

One landed with a soft THUD on the lab table. 

The other landed on Evan’s head. 

Evan gasped. He felt eight pointy tarantula legs scrambling through his hair. 

“Don’t upset it,” Kermit instructed. “Be very calm. Don’t let it know you’re 
afraid. A tarantula bite can be very painful.” 

“Hey, guys—what’s going on down there?” Aunt Dee’s voice rang through 
the basement. 

“Evan is playing with my tarantulas,” Kermit reported. 

Playing ? 

Evan wanted to scream. He pictured Kermit eating a tarantula sandwich. 



No. That’s not a good enough punishment, he decided. 

“Well, it’s too nice a day to stay down in the basement playing with 
spiders,” Aunt Dee scolded. 

“My tarantulas aren’t just any old spiders!” Kermit fumed. 

“Evan, your friend Andy is here,” Aunt Dee called down. “I think all three 
of you should go outside and get some fresh air.” 

“Andy?” Evan called. Without thinking, he started toward the stairs. 

“Don’t move!” Kermit warned. “Don’t get them excited!” 

Evan froze. The tarantula prickled the top of his head. He watched in horror 
as the other one made its way across the lab table and began crawling up his 
arm. 

Andy burst down the stairs, taking them two at a time. Her short brown hair 
bobbed behind her as she hurried across the basement to them. 

Andy didn’t dress like most sixth graders. She didn’t care what other kids 
wore. She liked bright colors. 

Today she wore a shiny magenta windbreaker over yellow tights. Her bright 
orange backpack hung over one shoulder. 

“Hey, guys!” she greeted them breathlessly. “What are you doing?” 

“An experiment,” Kermit replied solemnly. 

“So what else is new!” Andy said, rolling her eyes. But then her mouth 
dropped open in shock. She pointed at Evan with a trembling finger. “Evan! You 
have a tarantula on your head!” 

Evan felt the creature dig into his hair. 

“It’s part of the experiment,” Kermit told Andy. “There’s another tarantula 
crawling on his arm.” 

“Get... them... off....” Evan ordered Kermit through gritted teeth. 

Andy laughed. “This is an awesome experiment!” 

Evan let out a growl and raised his fists. 

“Calm,” Kermit warned. “If they sense your fear, you’re dead meat.” 

Evan turned to Andy for help. But she had unzipped her backpack and was 
digging inside. 

The tarantula prickled his scalp as it moved toward his left ear. “Kermit...” 
he begged. 

Evan gasped as Andy pulled a blue plastic can from her backpack. 

“Evan, look what I found!” Her dark eyes lit up. An evil grin spread across 
her face. 



“Monster Blood!” Evan cried. “Where’d you get that?” 

“Somewhere,” Andy teased. She raised her hand to the lid and started to 
twist it off. 

“No—!” Evan shrieked. He dove toward her, grabbing for the can. “Don’t 
open it! Andy— don’t]” 



5 


Andy pulled the can from Evan’s reach. 

And twisted it open. 

“NOOOO!” Evan shrieked. 

She tilted the can so that he could see inside. 

Empty. 

She laughed and tossed the can aside. “April Fools’!” 

“But it isn’t April!” Kermit declared. 

Evan gulped—and felt something pinch his ear. The tarantula! The Monster 
Blood can had frightened him so much, he’d forgotten about the creatures 
crawling over his body. 

“Uh-oh. Now you’ve excited them!” Kermit warned. “I think we’re going 
to learn how painful a tarantula bite can be.” 

Evan froze. He signaled frantically with his eyes for Andy to help him. 

“Okay, okay,” she said finally. She stepped up to Evan and plucked the 
tarantula off his head. 

“You’re ruining the experiment!” Kermit protested. 

Andy pulled the other tarantula off Evan’s arm. She handed them to Kermit. 

Grumbling to himself, Kermit dropped them into the glass jar. Then he 
scribbled some notes in a notebook. 

Evan glared angrily at his cousin, clenching his hands into tight fists. The 
tarantulas were gone, but his skin still prickled. “Let’s get the Super-Soakers,” he 
growled. 

He couldn’t wait to drench Kermit. He wanted to soak the little freak, to 
make him sputter and choke and shiver and shake until he begged for mercy. 

And then Evan would really let him have it! 

“It’s kind of cold out for a water fight,” Kermit said. 

“I don’t care,” Evan growled. “Let’s go.” 

He turned to Andy. She swung her backpack away and zipped it before he 
could see what was inside. 

“What else have you got in there?” Evan demanded. “More dumb jokes?” 

She sneered. “That’s for me to know and you to find out.” 



“Do you have more Monster Blood in there?” His voice cracked. “Do you 
have real Monster Blood?” 

“That’s for me to know and you to find out,” she repeated, hugging the 
backpack to her side. 

Maybe I’ll soak her too, Evan thought. She’s asking for it. “Come on 
outside,” he told her. “You can just watch.” 

“Like I believe you,” she replied, rolling her eyes again. “I’ll wait in here 
and do my homework. No way am I getting wet.” 

Evan eyed the backpack intently. Did she have a real can of Monster Blood 
in there? Did she? 

Please—let the answer be no! he prayed as he led Kermit to the backyard. 

They filled their squirt-gun canisters from the garden hose behind the 
garage. And the chase was on. 

Kermit ran. Evan fired first. The Super-Soaker sprayed a stream of water 
over Kermit’s head. 

Evan lowered the squirt gun, and the water stream bounced off the back of 
Kermit’s down jacket. 

Evan pumped hard and kept the water flowing, squeezing the trigger again. 
Again. He raised the spray and caught Kermit in the back of the neck. 

Kermit let out a yipe as the cold water ran down his back. 

He spun around. And shot a stream of water in Evan’s direction. 

Evan dropped to his knees on the grass. The water stream flew over him. 

He pulled the trigger and sent water splashing down the front of Kermit’s 
jacket. 

“Yo! Hey—!” A booming voice made Evan spin around. 

“Conan—!” Evan cried. 

Kermit sent a spray of icy water into the back of Evan’s head. 

Evan jumped up and staggered forward. “Kermit—stop!” He caught his 
balance before he bumped into Conan. 

“You trying to get my new sneakers wet?” Conan snarled. 

“No. No way,” Evan replied. He lowered his Super-Soaker to his side. 

Kermit stepped up beside Evan. “Give us a break, Conan,” Kermit said. 
“Evan isn’t afraid of you!” 

“Oh, yeah?” Conan replied menacingly. 

“Evan says he can take you down any day,” Kermit boasted. 

“I did not say that!” Evan cried. “Kermit—what is your problem?” 



He turned to Conan. “I didn’t say that. Really. My cousin is a little mixed 
up. You know. From the fumes. All those chemicals he fools around with.” 

Conan shook his beefy head. “You guys are really asking for it,” he 
muttered angrily. He took a step toward Evan. 

Evan gulped. He felt his Super-Soaker move. 

He turned—and saw that Kermit had reached behind him. 

Kermit was pushing up Evan’s squirt gun. 

Before Evan could jerk it away, Kermit pulled the trigger. 

And a stream of water poured out over Conan’s new sneakers. 



6 


Conan let out an angry cry. And grabbed the front of Evan’s coat. 

“I—I didn’t do it!” Evan sputtered. 

“It came out of your squirt gun,” Conan replied. His big hands tightened on 
the coat. He tugged, lifting Evan off the ground. 

“What are you going to do?” Evan shrieked. 

“Hey—what’s up?” Andy came trotting out from the house. 

Conan let Evan drop to the ground. 

Evan stumbled but quickly caught his balance. 

“Evan is teaching Conan a lesson,” Kermit reported. 

Evan gave his cousin a hard shove. “I’m warning you, Kermit....” 

Conan eyed Andy suspiciously. “What’s in your hand?” he demanded. 

Evan turned as Andy held up her hand. She gripped a small blue plastic can. 

“No—!” Evan gasped. “Andy—is that the empty one?” 

She shook her head, an evil grin on her face. “Not empty. This one is full.” 

Evan took a step back. “Get rid of it, Andy.” 

Kermit reached for the can. “It’s the real stuff? Let me see it,” he demanded 
eagerly. 

“Are you crazy?” Evan cried. “Why did you bring that here, Andy? You 
know how dangerous it is.” 

Andy’s brown eyes flashed excitedly. She didn’t say a word. Instead, she 
raised the blue can and started to pull off the lid. 

“Nooo!” Evan wailed. “Have you totally lost it?” 

Andy grinned at him. 

“Don’t open it!” Evan pleaded. “Please—don’t open it!” 

With a grunt, Conan stepped forward and swiped the can from Andy. “Let 
me see this stuff,” he growled. 

He raised the can in front of his face—and pulled off the lid. 



7 


Conan pulled open the lid—and three cloth snakes sprung out and hit him in the 
face. 

He let out a startled yelp and let the can fall from his hand. 

Andy tossed back her head and roared with laughter. Kermit laughed too, a 
high, shrill whinny. 

Evan swallowed hard. Too shaken to laugh. 

No one ever played jokes on Conan. No one. 

Evan stared hard at Conan, frozen in terror. Conan’s face was bright red. He 
was actually blushing! 

Now he’s going to pound us, Evan thought. When Conan is finished with 
us, we’re going to look just like those three fake snakes on the ground. 

But to Evan’s surprise, Conan spun around and stomped off without saying 
a word. 

“That was a close one,” Evan murmured. 

“It was funny!” Andy exclaimed. “What’s your problem? Lose your sense 
of humor?” 

“Yes,” Evan told her. “I don’t think Monster Blood is funny. It turned my 
dog, Trigger, into a giant. It turned our classroom hamster into a roaring monster. 
And it turned me into a twelve-foot-tall freak! That was the worst day of my 
life!” 

“I saved you—remember? I shrank you back to your real size,” Kermit 
bragged. 

“Yes, you did,” Evan had to admit. “That was the last good thing you ever 

did.” 

Kermit pouted. “That’s not a nice thing to say, Evan. I shared my tarantulas 
with you—didn’t I?” 

Evan groaned in reply. 

Kermit’s expression suddenly changed. Behind his glasses, his eyes flashed. 
“Wait right here,” he told them. He took off, running to his house. 

“Where are you going now?” Evan called after him. 

“I almost forgot what I wanted to show you,” Kermit called back. “It’s the 
coolest thing!” 



He disappeared into the house. 

Evan turned to Andy. “How am I going to survive ten days with him?” he 
wailed. “I just got here. And I’ve already had tarantulas climbing on my head!” 

Andy laughed. “It could have been worse.” 

“How could it be worse?” 

“Well... it could have been head lice,” she said. “Remember when Kermit 
was collecting head lice?” 

“You’re not cheering me up, Annnnndrea,” Evan groaned. 

“Don’t call me Andrea,” she grumbled. “Wow. You’re in a bad mood. Just 
think of all the money you are earning. Your aunt is paying you five dollars an 
hour to keep an eye on him—right?” 

“If I survive,” Evan moaned. 

He turned to the house. Kermit came running across the grass, carrying a 
glass case between his hands. 

“Now what is he bringing?” Evan cried. 

“Maybe this is the head lice,” Andy said. 

“Will you please stop talking about head lice?” Evan pleaded. “You’re 
making my head itch!” 

“Check this out!” Kermit cried, holding the glass case up to them. 

Evan squinted into the case. He saw white mice inside. Six or eight of them. 
With tiny black eyes and twitching pink noses. Crawling all over each other. 

“Kermit—why did you bring your white mice outside?” he demanded. 

“Watch,” Kermit replied. 

He pulled off the lid and dumped all the mice onto the grass. 

The mice didn’t hesitate. They scampered off in all directions. One of them 
ran right between Andy’s legs. She cried out in surprise and leaped out of the 
way. 

“Are you crazy?” Evan shrieked. “Your mice are all getting away!” 

“No, they’re not,” Kermit replied calmly. He pulled a small gray control 
unit from the back pocket of his baggy jeans. It looked a lot like a TV remote 
control. 

“This is so cool!” Kermit exclaimed. “See? I built an electric fence all the 
way around the backyard.” 

“I don’t see any fence,” Andy said. 

“Of course not. It’s electric,” Kermit told her. “It’s like the invisible fences 
people use to keep their dogs in the yard.” 



Evan squinted to the back of the yard. “I can’t even see your mice 
anymore,” he told Kermit. “They’ve all run away.” 

“No way,” Kermit insisted. He raised the slender control unit. “I have 
electric current going all around the yard. If a mouse tries to go through it, he 
gets a mild shock.” 

“But they’re gone!” Andy laughed. “The mice are all gone!” 

Kermit gazed around the backyard. 

His mouth dropped open. He slapped his forehead. “Oh, wow! I forgot to 
turn the fence on! I forgot to throw the switch!” 

He raised the control unit and pushed a red button. 

“YAAAIIIIII!” Evan let out a scream as a jolt of electricity shot through his 
body.

Evan’s arms waved wildly. His legs wiggled and bent. 

Kermit pushed the red button again. The buzzing stopped. 

Kermit stared at Evan. “Sorry. Guess you shouldn’t be standing there.” 

Evan took a deep breath and held it. He waited for his skin to stop tingling. 

“You looked like you were dancing!” Andy exclaimed. She threw her arms 
up and wiggled her body, imitating Evan. 

“Am I supposed to think that’s funny?” Evan asked weakly. 

“Are you okay?” she asked. “Your hair is standing straight up on end!” 

Evan pushed his hair down with both hands. But it popped right back up. 

He glared at Kermit. “Any other great inventions?” 

“Not right now,” Kermit replied. “You have to help me.” 

“Help you do what?” Evan growled. 

“Round up my mice,” Kermit said. He began crawling across the grass on 
his hands and knees. “Hurry! They are expensive lab mice. Mom will kill me if I 
lose them.” 

Evan and Andy saw they had no choice. They dropped to their hands and 
knees and began crawling like Kermit. 

“I don’t see any mice,” Evan whispered to Andy. “I think Kermit is in 
major trouble.” 

He heard a heavy thumping sound behind him. He turned and saw Dogface, 
the big sheepdog, bouncing across the yard. 

“No, Dogface!” Kermit cried. “No! Go home! Go home!” 

Furiously wagging his stubby tail, the big dog leaped onto Evan, sending 
him sprawling on the grass. 

“Dogface—you’re scaring the mice away!” Kermit wailed. 

Ignoring Kermit’s desperate pleas, the dog made a wide circle, excitedly 
running round and round the yard, barking and wagging his tail. 

“Hey—what’s going on?” an angry voice called. “Can’t you keep that dog 
quiet?” 

Conan came leaping over the low bushes that separated the two yards. Then 
he ran about three steps—and stopped. 



Evan heard a crackling sound. Then a loud BUZZ. 

Conan’s eyes bulged. His hands shot up. His body twisted in a wild dance. 
“Oh, wow,” Kermit murmured. “Didn’t I shut that off?” 

He fumbled with the control unit. The buzzing stopped. 

Conan took a few seconds to catch his breath. 

Then he let out a furious roar. And dove at Evan. 

“Wh-what are you going to do to me?” Evan stammered.

Evan leaned his elbows on the dinner table and stared down at the pile of 
spaghetti on his plate. Aunt Dee couldn’t mess up spaghetti—could she? he 
wondered. 

“Evan—what happened to your ear?” Aunt Dee asked. 

Evan sighed. His left ear was normal. But his right ear throbbed and burned. 
He knew it must look like a red cabbage! 

“What on earth happened to you?” his aunt demanded. 

Evan didn’t want to describe how Conan had won a tug-of-war with his ear. 
He mumbled something into his plate. 

“Evan got into another fight with Conan,” Kermit told his mom. 

She lowered her fork. “Evan—is that true?” 

Evan nodded. “It wasn’t exactly a fight.” 

“I warned you to stay away from that boy,” his aunt scolded. “You really 
should be smart enough not to pick a fight with someone so big.” 

“And Evan lost all my white mice too,” Kermit whined. 

His mother’s mouth dropped open. “Those mice cost a lot of money!” She 
narrowed her eyes at Evan. 

Evan swallowed hard. “I’m not the one who brought them outside,” he 
choked out. 

“I left you in charge,” Kermit’s mom said sternly. “You are responsible for 
what goes on here when I’m away.” She scowled and waved her fork at him. “If 
it’s too big a job for you, Evan, I can find a grownup to come stay with Kermit.” 

“No!” Evan cried. 

Being responsible for Kermit was impossible. But he didn’t want to lose the 
job. If he didn’t earn money, he couldn’t go to sleepaway camp. 

“I can handle the job,” he told his aunt. 

Across from him, Kermit gobbled down mouthful after mouthful of 
spaghetti. The orange sauce ran down his chin. 

Evan rolled several spaghetti strands on his fork, then took a big bite. 

He chewed for about three seconds. Then he let out a scream. 
“ YAAAAAAIIIII! ” 

His mouth was on fire! His head felt about to explode! 



“Is it spicy enough?” Aunt Dee asked. “Did I put in enough hot sauce?” 


Later, as Evan changed into his pajamas, Kermit typed away on his computer. 
Evan’s lips were swollen from the spicy spaghetti. They looked like two big 
salamis hanging from his face. 

He gazed at himself in the dresser mirror. His ear resembled a red cabbage. 

He shook his head unhappily, thinking about Conan. “I have to do 
something about him,” he mumbled. 

Kermit spun around from his keyboard. “What did you say?” 

“Conan went too far this time,” Evan grumbled bitterly. “He’s making me 
look like a freak.” 

“Yes, you do,” Kermit agreed. 

“Shut up. I didn’t ask you,” Evan snapped. “You’re not exactly Brad Pitt!” 

“Who’s that?” Kermit asked. 

Evan ignored him. He climbed into bed. He hit the pillow a few times, 
fluffing it up. He knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep. 

He was too angry. 

“This time Conan went too far,” he repeated, muttering to himself. “This 
time I have to find a way to pay him back.” 

Behind his red-framed glasses, Kermit’s round black eyes lit up. “You mean 
revenge ?” he asked excitedly. 

“Yeah. I guess,” Evan replied, settling his huge ear on the pillow. His hands 
were clenched into tight fists. His whole body felt tense. 

“Revenge.” He repeated the word a few times. “That’s what I want. 
Someone has to show Conan that he cannot keep pushing everyone around and 
beating everyone up. Revenge...” 

Kermit shut off his computer. When he turned back to Evan, he had a wide 
grin on his face. “I think I can help you,” he said. 



10 


“Let me show you something,” Kermit said eagerly, lowering his voice to a 
whisper. He pulled something out of his bottom desk drawer and brought it over 
to Evan’s foldout bed. 

“Look.” Kermit’s grin grew wider. He handed the object to Evan. 

“Hey—!” Evan cried out. “It’s so hairy!” 

Evan stared at the small object. Some kind of ball, covered in thick, greasy 
black hair. “This is totally gross,” he told Kermit. “What is this? Why are you 
showing it to me?” 

“It’s an egg,” Kermit said, giggling. 

“Huh?” Evan nearly dropped it. He turned the hairy thing between his 
hands. “What kind of egg?” he asked suspiciously. 

“Just an egg,” Kermit replied. “I took it from the refrigerator.” 

“But—” Evan started. 

“Remember, I told you about my hair-growing formula?” Kermit asked. “I 
said it wasn’t ready yet. But it is.” 

Evan handed the hairy egg back to his cousin. It was too creepy. It was 
making him sick. 

He swallowed. “You really can grow thick hair like that on an egg?” 

Kermit nodded, grinning. He cradled the egg in his hands as if it were a 
precious jewel. “My hair mixture works, Evan. We can use it to pay Conan 
back.” 

“Whoa!” Evan cried. “We can’t make him drink it and turn his mouth all 
hairy. That’s too horrible—even for Conan.” 

“I know,” Kermit agreed. “But we can pour it on his hands, can’t we? We 
can give him werewolf hands! That would be pretty funny—wouldn’t it?” 

Evan laughed. “Yeah. Yeah, it sure would! Let’s do it!” 

Kermit carried the hairy egg back to his desk drawer. “I was going to test 
my hair mixture out on Dogface next,” he told Evan. “But Dogface is already 
hairy enough. Conan is better.” 

“Much better,” Evan agreed, smiling for the first time that night. “Where is 
your hair mixture?” 

“Don’t worry. I have it hidden safe and sound,” Kermit replied. “It will be 



ready when we need it.” 


* * * 


It took Evan hours to fall asleep. Partly because he couldn’t stop thinking of his 
revenge against Conan. And partly because Kermit was snoring his head off. 

Evan stared up at the ceiling with his hands over his ears, unable to shut out 
the awful sound. A throaty gluggg glugggg, followed by a whistle. 

Kermit is obnoxious even when he’s asleep, Evan thought bitterly. 

When he finally fell asleep, Evan dreamed he was standing in his pajamas 
in Kermit’s backyard. It was night. Long shadows fell over the grass. 

Peering into the back of the yard, Evan saw Kermit’s white mice. At least 
half a dozen of them. They had clustered around something hidden in the grass. 

In the dream, Evan moved closer. And saw what had interested the lab 
mice. 

A blue can. An open can of Monster Blood! 

Evan’s mouth dropped open in horror. 

The green gunk had bubbled out of the can. And the white mice were 
silently gobbling it. Gobbling down chunk after chunk. Their teeth gnashing up 
and down. Their furry bodies quivering with excitement as they ate. 

As they swallowed down the sticky green goo, they grew. Evan stared in 
shock. The mice inflated until they were as big as dogs. Then bigger. The giant 
mice rose up on their hind legs. 

They’re taller than me! Evan saw, stumbling back. And so fat! They must 
weigh two hundred pounds! 

They turned to him, gnashing their teeth hungrily. As tall as the house, the 
mice lurched heavily toward Evan. 

One of them tossed back its head, opened its jaws wide, and let out a roar. 
Evan saw rows of jagged gray teeth. 

And then the mice lurched heavily toward him. Their feet thudded the 
ground. Their dark eyes glinted in the silvery glow from the moon. 

“Nooooooooo!” He opened his mouth in a long, high howl. 

He raised his hands to protect himself. 

The mice rose over him now. One of them lowered its head. Its jagged teeth 
slid around Evan’s waist. Its jaw tightened. 

Evan felt its hot, sour breath stream over him. 



Felt the teeth dig into his side. 

And then he was being lifted up. Lifted in the giant jaws of the white 
mouse. The mouse clamped its jaws shut. Bit down hard. 

Evan knew it was chewing him. Chewing him to pieces. 

He opened his eyes. Began to lift himself from the frightening dream. Lift 
himself... lift himself... 

And heard a tapping at Kermit’s bedroom window. 

Evan squinted through the darkness. To the window. And saw a giant 
mouse! 



11 


No. 

No. The mouse was part of the dream. 

I’m still half in my dream, half awake, Evan realized, blinking his eyes. 

He shook himself hard. Shook himself awake. 

The mouse faded slowly, then vanished. And Evan stared at the window, 
stared at Andy outside in the darkness. Tapping on the glass. Tapping so 
urgently. 

Evan jumped from the small foldout bed. His legs were tangled in the 
blanket. He stumbled and had to grab the edge of Kermit’s dresser to catch his 
balance. 

One foot had fallen asleep. He dragged it, limping to the window. He 
silently pushed open the window, careful not to wake Kermit. 

Kermit snored away, glugging and whistling. He had kicked his blanket to 
the floor. He had fallen asleep with his glasses on. 

Evan leaned out into the darkness. A gust of cold wind made him shiver. 

“Andy—what are you doing here?” he cried out. 

“Get dressed,” Andy ordered. “Hurry, Evan. I have to show you 
something.” 

“Huh?” He glanced back at Kermit’s clock radio. “It’s almost midnight!” 

Andy raised a finger to her lips. “Sssshhhh. Hurry. Get dressed. I think 
you’ll want to see this.” 

She held up a can. A blue plastic can. 

Evan groaned. “You really came here in the middle of the night for another 
joke? Give me a break, Andy. What’s going to spring out at me this time?” 

But then he saw the serious expression on Andy’s face. 

“It isn’t a joke—is it?” he whispered. 

She shook her head. 

“It’s Monster Blood—right?” Evan demanded. 

Andy nodded. “I think so. The can—it looks the same.” 

Evan spun away from the window. He pulled on jeans and a sweatshirt right 
over his pajamas. His hands trembled as he tied his shoes. 



He grabbed his down jacket from the closet. And climbed out the window. 

“I was dreaming about Monster Blood,” he told Andy. 

She bit her bottom lip. “This isn’t a dream,” she replied quietly. 

Evan shivered. It was a cold, clear night. 

Andy wore her magenta windbreaker and a pair of silvery leggings. She had 
a red wool ski cap pulled down over her short brown hair. 

She raised the plastic can to Evan. “I think it’s the real thing. I hurried over 
as soon as I was sure my parents were asleep.” 

“Where did you get it?” he whispered. 

“Behind the lab on Peachtree where my dad works. We were picking him 
up before dinner. I was waiting in the parking lot behind the lab. I found this in a 
whole pile of stuff.” 

“You didn’t open it—did you?” Evan demanded. 

“No way,” she replied. She tried to hand him the can. But he waved it away. 

“I don’t want it,” Evan told her. “Why did you bring it over here?” 

Andy shrugged. “I thought after this afternoon, you might want to pay 
Conan back for being such a big jerk.” 

“Yes, I do want to pay Conan back,” Evan admitted. 

“So use the Monster Blood,” Andy urged. “You can put a little of it in his 
lunch at school. You can—” 

“No way!” Evan cried. “Conan is already a mountain! I don’t want to make 
him any BIGGER!” 

The light faded from Andy’s dark eyes. “I guess you’re right. But we could 
put Monster Blood in his bed. Or—” 

“Stop!” Evan ordered. “It’s too dangerous. I don’t want to use Monster 
Blood on Conan. Kermit and I have another plan for Conan. A really good plan.” 

“What is it?” Andy demanded eagerly. 

“I’ll tell you as soon as you get rid of the Monster Blood,” Evan told her. “I 
really don’t want that stuff around. Go hide it someplace where no one will ever 
find it.” 

“But, Evan—” Andy protested. 

Evan didn’t let her finish. “You know what will happen if that can gets 
opened,” he said firmly. “It will bubble up. And it will grow and grow, and we 
won’t be able to stop it.” 

“Okay, okay.” Andy rolled her eyes. “I’ll take it home. I’ll find a good 
hiding place.” 



“Promise?” Evan demanded, eyeing her sharply. 

“Promise,” she repeated, raising her right hand. 

“Hey—what’s that?” a voice called from behind them. 

Evan spun around and saw Kermit scramble out the open window. 
Kermit grabbed the blue can from Andy’s hand. 

“Cool!” he cried. “Monster Blood! Is it real?” 

He didn’t wait for an answer. 

He gripped the can tightly—and pulled off the lid. 



12 


“No! Don’t do that!” Evan screamed. 

Too late. 

“Close it up!” Evan cried frantically. “Close the can—quick!” 

Kermit stood staring into the open can. “It’s too dark. I can’t see anything.” 

“Give me that!” Evan ordered. He leaped forward and tried to swipe the can 
away. 

He grabbed the can—but knocked the lid from Kermit’s hand. 

Kermit made a wild grab for the lid. But a gust of wind blew it out of his 
reach. 

As Evan gaped in horror, the wind lifted the plastic lid... lifted it over their 
heads. 

“Noooooo!” He let out a long wail as the lid spun crazily above them. He 
made a wild grab. Another. Missed. 

The wind carried the lid up to the slanted roof of the house. It hit the 
shingles. Slid down a few feet. And came to a rest in the metal rain gutter. 

“I don’t believe this,” Evan muttered. 

“I’ll get the ladder from the garage,” Kermit offered. He took off across the 
dew-wet grass. 

“Hurry!” Evan cried. 

“The Monster Blood—it’s moving!” Andy exclaimed, pointing with a 
trembling finger. 

Evan gazed down at the can gripped tightly in his hand. He couldn’t really 
see inside. Dark clouds had drifted over the moon, blocking out the light. 

Evan brought the can close to his face. And gasped. 

“Andy—it’s bluer 

“Huh?” She pressed close to him. Their heads banged as they both eagerly 
stared into the can. 

Yes. The thick glop inside the can was blue—not green. 

It made a sick plopping sound as it rolled from side to side, like an ocean 
wave. 

“It—it’s trying to get out!” Andy stammered. 



“Hurry, Kermit!” Evan called. 

Kermit came running from the garage, an aluminum ladder tilted over one 
shoulder. 

“Why is it blue?” Andy asked. 

The thick goo lapped at the side of the can. As Evan stared in horror, it 
splashed up over the top. 

“Kermit—please hurry! Get the lid!” he cried. 

Kermit propped the ladder against the side of the house. Then he turned 
back to them. “Someone else has to climb up,” he called. 

“Just do it!” Evan screamed frantically. “The stuff is spilling out over the 

top!” 

“But I’m afraid of heights!” Kermit declared. 

Evan rolled his eyes. “It isn’t that high. Just climb up, and—” 

“I can’t!” Kermit whined. “Really!” 

“I’ll do it.” Andy ran to the ladder. Kermit held it steady for her. 

Evan watched her scramble up. The Monster Blood bobbed and plopped in 
the can. The clouds rolled away from the moon. It was definitely bright blue, 
Evan saw. 

And definitely trying to raise itself out of the can. 

Andy climbed up to the gutter. Holding the ladder with her right hand, she 
reached out to the lid with her free hand. 

Reached... reached... 

And the wind blew the lid from the gutter. 

“Noooo—!” Andy screamed. She grabbed for it. 

Lost her balance. 

Grabbed the sides of the ladder with both hands. 

The lid spun crazily in the air. Then it swooped down to the grass. 

“I’ve got it!” Kermit cried. He dove for it and grabbed it in one hand. 

“Yes!” Evan cried happily. “Put it on the can—quick!” 

Andy carefully lowered herself rung by rung. 

She reached the ground, turned, breathing hard, and hurried back to Evan. 
Kermit came running over with the lid. 

But before he reached Evan, a voice rang out from the yard across from his. 
“Hey—what’s going on?” 

Evan looked up to see Conan running across the grass. 



“Oh, no!” Evan moaned, and the Monster Blood can fell out of his hand. 



13 


With a gasp, Evan bent to pick up the can. 

Had the blue Monster Blood spilled out? 

No. 

He lifted it carefully, holding one hand over the open top. 

Conan stopped at the edge of the yard. “What are you three babies doing 
out so late?” he demanded. ‘Til tell your mommies!” 

“Give us a break, Conan,” Andy called. “We’re not bothering you!” 

“Your face is bothering me!” Conan shot back. Then his eyes fell on the can 
in Evan’s hand. “What’s that?” 

Evan nearly dropped the can again. “This? Uh... nothing.... It’s_” 

Evan’s mind went blank. He couldn’t think of a good lie to tell Conan. 

Kermit grabbed the can away from Evan. “It’s candy,” he told Conan. “Blue 
Fruit Roll in a Barrel! We saw it on TV, and it’s awesome.” 

“Give me some! ” Conan ordered. He reached out his big hand. 

“No way!” Kermit teased him, pulling the can back. “We’re not sharing 
with you!” 

He pretended to lick the blue candy. “Wow. That’s really excellent!” 

“Guess I’m going to have to take it from you,” Conan declared menacingly. 
He took a step toward them, his hand outstretched. “Give it.” 

“Are you crazy?” Evan whispered to Kermit. “Why did you tease him? 
Now he’s going to take it and—” 

“No problem,” Kermit whispered back. A sly grin spread over his face. 
“Watch.” 

“Give it,” Conan thundered, waving his outstretched hand. He took another 
step toward them. Another. 

Evan heard the crackle of electricity before he saw the white spark. 

Conan’s eyes bulged. His hands shot up. His knees buckled. 

“Urg. Urg.” He uttered two strange cries as Kermit’s invisible electric fence 
zapped him again. 

Conan staggered back, gasping for breath. His broad chest heaved up and 
down. He reminded Evan of a bull about to charge. 



Kermit raised the can and pretended to eat the Monster Blood again. “Wow. 
That is excellent !” he declared. 

Conan glared at the three of them. Even across the dark yard, Evan could 
see the fury on his face. 

But the bull couldn’t charge. Couldn’t get to them. Not as long as the 
electric fence was turned on. 

Conan balled his hands into fists. “You’re history,” he called to them. “All 
three of you. You’re roadkill.” 

He spun around. Swinging his fists hard at his sides, he stomped into his 
house. 

Andy let out a sigh of relief. “That was pretty good!” she told Kermit. 

A high, shrill giggle escaped Kermit’s throat. “Yeah. Not bad!” 

“There’s just one problem,” Evan murmured. “We’re roadkill if we ever 
leave this backyard!” 

He turned to Kermit. “Give me back the can. We’d better close it—” 

Evan gasped. 

The can in Kermit’s hand! He was holding it upside down! 

Evan grabbed for it. 

Too late. 

With a sick PLOP, the blue gunk dropped out of the can. 

It landed on the grass in front of Evan’s feet. He stared down at it as it 
quivered. Quivered and shook, like blue Jell-O. 

It glowed in the light from the moon. Glowed bright blue. 

Bobbed and trembled. 

And grew. 

“It’s... changing shape!” Andy cried. She leaned forward, resting her hands 
on her knees, and gazed down wide-eyed at it. 

The blue blob wiggled. It rolled over once, moving away from Evan. 

And grew some more. 

It rolled again. Wiggled from side to side. 

And then rose up. Up... as if trying to stand. 

“I don’t believe this!” Evan choked out. “It’s some kind of creature !” 

“You’re right!” Kermit agreed. “It’s ALIVE!” 



14 


Evan squatted on the grass, watching the blue Monster Blood intently. Andy and 
Kermit stood openmouthed as the creature bounced, and grew, and took shape. 

A sleek blue head popped up from the body. A curved gash in the head 
became a mouth. It turned up in a goofy grin. 

Two big, round eyes appeared above the mouth. 

The creature was about the size of a chipmunk. It made a squeaking sound 
as it bounced over the grass. Its rubbery body throbbed rapidly, like a heart. 

“It’s so cute!” Andy declared, raising her hands to the sides of her face. “It’s 
like a lovable little blob creature.” 

“It looks friendly,” Kermit added. “It keeps staring up at us and smiling.” 

Evan didn’t say a word. As he studied the creature, a heavy feeling of dread 
formed in the pit of his stomach. 

I don’t care how cute the little guy looks, he thought. This is Monster 
Blood. And Monster Blood is always evil. 

“Let’s try to push it back in the can,” he suggested. 

The creature bounced and squeaked. 

“Do you think it will fit?” Kermit asked. 

Evan stared at the grinning blob. “We have to squeeze it back in,” he told 
them. 

“But it’s so cute!” Andy protested. She bent down close to the little 
creature. “You’re a cute guy, aren’t you?” she said to it. “Do you like to be 
petted?” 

Andy reached for it with both hands. 

It slid right through her fingers and bounced away, squeaking loudly. 

“Oooh! It’s so cold and wet!” Andy declared. “Look! It’s like a little seal!” 

She made another grab for it. But again the blobby creature bounced away 
from her. 

Kermit stepped in front of it. “I’d like to get it under a microscope,” he said. 
“Maybe take a few tissue samples.” 

“You have to catch it first,” Evan told him. 

Kermit dove for it. Grabbed. 



The creature bounced over his hands and escaped. 

“Hey—he licked me!” Kermit exclaimed. “I think he licked me.” 

“He seems to be friendly,” Andy said. She dropped to her knees. “Here, 
Blobby. Here, Blobby,” she called. She held out her hands to it. 

To everyone’s surprise, the creature bounced over to her. 

Andy trapped it gently between her hands. She giggled. “It’s so co/d!” 

She ran her hand tenderly over the back of its quivering body. “Do you like 
to be petted?” she asked it again softly. 

The creature purred. 

Evan and Kermit both let out cries of surprise. 

Andy petted the blue blob some more. It purred louder. 

“He likes it!” Andy declared, laughing. 

“Weird,” Kermit murmured. “See if you can pull off a hunk so I can study 
it.” 

“No way!” Andy cried. “You’re not hurting my little Blobby.” She petted it 
tenderly. 

“Be careful,” Evan warned. “This is Monster Blood—remember?” 

“It can’t be,” Andy argued. “Monster Blood is green. This cute thing is 
something else.” 

“It might be a different kind of Monster Blood,” Kermit suggested. “You 
know. A different flavor.” 

“Whoa!” Andy cried out as the creature bounced out of her hands. 
Throbbing wetly, it began bouncing and rolling toward the garage. 

“Catch it!” Evan cried. 

All three of them chased after the creature. It moved surprisingly fast. 

Kermit made a grab for it—and it slid through his hands. 

Evan ran in front of it and tried to block its path. But it rolled around him 
and kept bouncing. 

“Don’t let it get away!” Andy cried. 

Evan made another frantic grab—and lifted the wet blob off the ground. 
“Got it!” Evan cried. 

But the creature changed shape. Squeaking loudly, it pulled itself in until it 
resembled a giant worm. And then it slid easily from Evan’s hands. 

“Whoa—it’s co/d!” Evan exclaimed. He examined his hands. The creature 
had left a coating of wet blue slime on Evan’s palms. 

Evan glanced up in time to see the creature roll to the back of the yard. 



“Stop it!” he cried. “Don’t let it go over to Conan’s yard!” 

He ran to catch up to it. Kermit reached it first. “Hey—what’s it doing?” 
Kermit demanded. “It’s turning on the garden hose.” 

The hose was coiled against the back of the garage. A long end of it 
stretched along the ground. 

Evan stopped and stared as the creature perched on top of the nozzle. Its 
body began to bounce up and down in a steady rhythm. It stopped squeaking and 
began to make loud gulping sounds. 

“Is it drinking?” Andy asked. 

“Huh? I think it is! ” Evan cried, staring in amazement. 

The creature bobbed on top of the hose nozzle. Drinking. And as it drank, it 
grew. 

“It’s inflating—like a water balloon!” Kermit declared. 

“We’d better stop it before it gets too big,” Evan warned. 

Evan tried to turn the water off, but the spigot wouldn’t budge. “It’s stuck!” 
he cried. “I can’t turn it! It’s stuck!” 

The creature gulped more water. It was as big as a basketball now, and still 
growing. 

Evan grabbed it with both hands and tugged. His hands slid off the slippery, 
wet body. 

The creature was as big as a beach ball. 

“Help me!” Evan cried, grabbing the creature again. “We’ve got to pull it 
off the hose.” 

He gave a hard tug. But the gulping creature held on to the hose. 

Andy stepped up beside Evan. They both wrapped their arms around the 
inflating creature and struggled to pull it loose. 

“It—it’s attached itself!” Evan gasped. 

The creature bulged, bigger, bigger, until Evan and Andy couldn’t get their 
arms around it. 

“Now what?” Evan groaned. 

And the creature exploded. 

Evan heard a deafening POP. A wave of cold water and slime hurtled over 
him, knocking him over. 

Evan landed in a sitting position. 

“Ohhhhh.” He let out a groan as he wiped the thick blanket of slime off his 
eyes and face. 



“Sick,” he heard Andy mutter. 

He turned and saw that Kermit and Andy were also drenched. Thick gobs of 
slime clung to Kermit’s glasses. Andy’s hair was soaked, matted flat on her head. 

“Sick,” Andy repeated, staring down at her slime-covered hands. “Oh, 
yuck. This is sick” 

Evan wiped more goo from his eyes. Then he turned to where the creature 
had stood—and gasped in shock. “Oh, noooo!” he cried. “Am I seeing things?” 



15 


Two blue creatures bobbed beside the garage. 

Two creatures about the size of chipmunks. 

Squeaking softly, they grinned at Evan, Kermit, and Andy. Their big black 
eyes rolled in their heads. 

“It multiplied !” Kermit exclaimed. 

Evan swallowed hard. He scooped a gob of slime off his shoulder. “I don’t 
like this,” he murmured. “I don’t like this one bit.” 

“But they’re so cute!” Andy protested. 

Evan shivered. The night air suddenly felt much colder. He turned to the 
house. It was covered in darkness. 

What if Aunt Dee wakes up and catches us out here? he wondered. I’ll be in 
major trouble. My baby-sitting job will be over. No sleepaway camp... 

“It’s getting late,” he told them. “We’ve got to go in.” 

“But we can’t just leave these little guys out here!” Andy protested. 

Evan sighed. He knew Andy was right. “Okay,” he agreed, “let’s round 
them up quickly. We’ll get a bag or a bucket or something.” 

The two blue blobs began bouncing in different directions. 

“No! Don’t let them get away!” Evan cried. “If they split up, we’ll never 
catch them.” 

“I have an idea,” Kermit said. He darted across the grass and picked up the 
garden hose. He turned the nozzle, and a hard spray shot out. 

“I’ll keep them against the back of the garage,” he announced. “You go find 
something to put them in.” 

Evan watched as Kermit raised the hose and aimed the spray at the two 
creatures. 

The hard spray sent them both flying against the garage wall. 

“It’s working!” Kermit cried. “I’ve trapped them!” 

He kept the spray on them. The water pushed them back, pressing the two 
creatures against the garage. 

“Hurry—!” Kermit cried. 

But Evan hesitated. He watched as the two creatures opened their mouths 



wide. Wider. And began to gulp. 

“Kermit—turn off the hose!” Evan shouted. “It’s a bad idea. They’re 
drinking it!” 

As the stream of water shot into their gaping mouths, the creatures inflated 
rapidly. They gulped the water hungrily, blowing up bigger and bigger. 

“Kermit—shut off the hose!” Evan ordered. 

Too late. 

Another loud explosion. Another burst of water and slime. 

And now Evan stared across the lawn at FOUR blue blobs! 

Startled, Kermit dropped the hose. Water shot across the lawn. 

Evan dove for the garage and frantically turned the water spigot. The water 
dribbled to a stop. 

But the four blue creatures were already lapping up water from the grass. 
And growing bigger. 

“We have to stop them,” Evan gasped. “We have to pick them up before 
they explode again.” 

He and Andy ran together, frantically reaching down to grab two of them. 
But Andy stopped suddenly—and Evan ran right into her. 

“Whoa!” he cried. “Why did you stop?” 

“Look at them.” Andy pointed. 

Evan gazed down at the bobbing creatures. They were lapping the night 
dew off the grass. “What about them?” he asked impatiently. 

“These four look different,” Andy replied. “Check out their faces. They’re 
not smiling.” 

“Who cares?” Evan shrieked. “They’re drinking! Why do we care if they’re 
smiling or not? Do we want eight of them? No! So let’s get them!” 

Evan leaped forward and grabbed one in each hand. One blue blob slipped 
out and bounced away, squeaking loudly. 

Evan wrapped both hands around the other one, determined to hold it tight. 
“Get a bucket!” he told Andy. “Or a garbage bag or something!” 

Then Evan let out a scream as a sharp jolt of pain shot through his arm. 

He looked down. The blue creature had clamped its jaws around his wrist. 

“H-help!” Evan stammered. “Owwwww! It—it’s biting me! It’s biting my 
hand off!” 



16 


Evan tugged at the creature with his free hand. “Help me! Ow! It—it’s sucking 
my skin!” he wailed. 

Kermit and Andy dove to his side. They both grabbed at the wet blue blob. 
Andy’s hands slipped off, and she stumbled backwards. 

But Kermit held on, held on with both hands. And tugged. Tugged until 
they all heard a loud POP. 

Kermit pulled the creature off and tossed it across the yard. 

Evan rubbed his arm. “It was sucking my skin,” he moaned. “Sucking the 
water out, I guess.” 

Kermit started running to the house. “I’m telling Mom,” he cried. “This is 
too dangerous!” 

“No!” Evan grabbed Kermit around the waist. “I can’t get in any more 
trouble with your mom. Let’s get them all rounded up first. If we don’t, there 
will be hundreds of them!” 

Evan turned to Andy. Her teeth were chattering. “This is getting scary,” she 
murmured. “Listen to them.” 

The blue blobs weren’t grinning anymore. Low growls came out of their 
scowling mouths. 

“They were so cute,” Andy said softly. “But now they’re turning mean.” 

Two of the creatures were rolling in the grass, sucking up moisture. Two 
others were bouncing toward the garden hose. 

Evan turned away. He glanced quickly to the house. “Where is Kermit?” he 
asked. 

Andy shrugged. “Did he go inside to tell his mother?” 

“I hope not,” Evan moaned. “I’m going to be in such bad trouble!” 

The blue blobs were inflating, getting ready to explode and multiply. 

“I’m already in big trouble,” Evan told himself. He started to the house. But 
halfway there, he saw Kermit running from the garage. 

“I’ll catch them!” Kermit cried. He waved a long-handled net in the air. 
Evan recognized it—the net Kermit used to collect butterflies. 

Kermit ran across the grass, swinging the net. 

Evan heard a loud, wet explosion. His eyes swept over the dark lawn. How 



many were there now? 

Eight? 

Yes. 

His throat tightened in panic. We can’t catch them all! he thought. 

Kermit lowered the net to the grass. Swung hard. And captured one of the 
blue blobs. 

It uttered a sharp growl. The net bounced and shook at the end of its pole. 

“Got one! Where do I dump it?” Kermit called excitedly. 

Evan spotted a bucket at the side of the garage. He ran across the grass 
toward it, waving to Kermit to follow him. 

Kermit saw the bucket too. He began to lower the net into it. “In you go!” 
he cried. 

But they both heard a ripping sound. 

The creature hurtled out from the net—and bounced away. 

“He—he chewed through the net!” Kermit exclaimed. He tossed the net 
aside. 

Evan picked up the bucket and chased after the bouncing creature. “Just 
pick them up and toss them in,” he cried. “If we can keep them from drinking, 
they won’t multiply.” 

Andy dove for one. It slipped out of her hands. “We need gloves,” she 
suggested. “We could hold them better if—” 

“We don’t have time to find gloves!” Evan cried. “If we don’t catch them 
fast, there will be a hundred of them!” 

“But what if they grab on to you?” Andy cried. “What if they start sucking 
your skin?” 

Evan didn’t know how to answer that question. He swallowed hard. “Just 
be careful,” he told her. 

Hearing low grunts, he raised his eyes to Aunt Dee’s flower garden. “Oh, 
noooo!” he moaned. 

“Mom’s flowers!” Kermit cried. 

Three or four of the creatures were sucking the water from the flowers. The 
blobs were already huge, ready to explode. A wide path of flowers lay dead and 
wilted behind them. 

Kermit’s mother took such pride in her flower garden; she struggled to keep 
it blooming all through the winter. And now it’s a mess, Evan saw. 

And she’s going to blame me. 



“Get them!” he shouted. “Get them out of the flowers!” 

But he heard a muffled scream. And spun around. 

“Help me... help...” Andy struggled as a big blue blob wrapped around her 

face. 

It pulsed and throbbed. 

She hit it with both fists. Pounded it. 

She dropped to her knees, struggling to remove it. 

Evan froze in horror as the creature grunted and growled, spreading wetly 
over Andy’s face. 

“Help...” she moaned. “Can’t breathe... can’t breathe...” 



17 


Evan gasped in horror as Andy struggled with the blue creature. She pounded it 
with her fists. Pulled at its slippery skin. Shoved it with her open palms. 

Evan took a deep breath. Ran over to her. And grasped the creature in both 
hands. 

It’s so slippery and cold! he thought. 

He dug his fingers into its wet flesh, tightening his grip. 

Then he heaved up with all his strength. 

The creature lifted off Andy’s face with a loud POP. Evan lost his balance 
and nearly fell. 

The blob slipped out of his hands, bounced over the grass, and landed in a 
large puddle near the driveway. 

“Ohhhhhh, sick!” Andy moaned. She wiped thick slime off her face. Still 
on her knees, her whole body trembled. 

Evan raised his eyes to the blob. Facedown, it gulped the puddle noisily. Its 
shimmery blue body bulged bigger, bigger... 

Until it exploded—sending a wave of water and slime over Evan and Andy. 
Evan staggered back as the cold gunk washed over him. 

Wiping it off his eyes, he helped Andy to her feet. 

“The flowers!” Kermit cried. “They’ve ruined them all!” 

Evan turned to the garden. In time to see two more inflated blue blobs 
explode into four. 

The four new blobs bounced up and down furiously, gnashing their pointed 
teeth. 

“The new ones have teeth!” Andy declared. “Each time they explode, they 
get meaner!” 

“I’ve had enough of this!” Evan exclaimed. He grabbed a shovel on the 
ground beside the flower garden. “Kermit, Andy—hurry! Get big trash bags!” 

Kermit darted into the garage. A few seconds later, he came out carrying 
two plastic trash bags. He handed one to Andy. They swung them open and ran 
to catch up with Evan. 

“Let’s get these guys!” Evan declared. 

He lowered the shovel blade to the ground and scooped up a blue blob. 



Andy held out her trash bag. Evan dropped the creature into the bag. It 
plopped in heavily. Andy gripped the top of the bag and held on. 

Working feverishly, Evan scooped up another one and dropped it into 
Andy’s bag. 

Another explosion sent a wave of slime flying. Evan ducked under it—and 
caught two blue blobs on his shovel blade. With a groan, he swung the blade 
hard into Kermit’s trash bag. 

In minutes, the two trash bags bulged. 

“Only a few left,” Evan said, catching his breath. Despite the cool night air, 
sweat poured down his forehead. 

Beside the garage, two creatures gulped water hungrily from a puddle on 
the grass. Another creature bounced over the wilted flower garden, uttering low, 
angry growls. 

“These guys are trying to get out,” Kermit complained. He had hoisted his 
bag over his slender shoulder. 

The bag throbbed. Inside it, the creatures grunted and growled. 

“What are we going to do with these bags?” Andy demanded. “These blue 
things are alive! We can’t just throw them in trash cans.” 

“They wouldn’t fit, anyway,” Kermit said. 

Evan wiped sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand. “Let’s get 
them all collected first,” he sighed. “Then we can decide what to do.” 

It took several minutes to round up the final three. They kept bouncing 
away and sliding off the shovel. 

Finally, all of the grunting, growling creatures were caught. Evan helped 
Kermit and Andy tie up the bulging trash bags. 

“Now what?” Andy demanded. 

Evan blinked as a bright yellow light flashed on. 

Another light. 

The lawn shimmered green, nearly as bright as day. The colors all came into 
focus. 

Evan spun toward the house. The porch light had been turned on. And all 
the lights around the yard. 

“It’s Mom!” Kermit gasped. “We’re caught!” 



18 


Evan could see Aunt Dee in the kitchen, moving to the back door. “Quick— 
don’t let her see! Hide the trash bags!” he cried. 

“But where?” Kermit demanded. 

“Just hide them!” Evan ordered. 

Kermit and Andy grabbed up their bulging trash bags. Kermit led the way 
around the side of the house. “We’ll drag them to the basement,” he said. “I’ll 
lock them in a storage closet or something. We can figure out what to do with 
them in the morning.” 

The back door swung open, and Aunt Dee stepped out onto the back stoop. 
She tightened her bathrobe belt and squinted around the yard. 

“My garden!” she shrieked in horror, raising her hands to her face. 

And then her eyes stopped on Evan. 

“Huh?” she gasped. “Evan—what on earth are you doing out at this time of 
night?” 

“Well...” 

Evan’s mind raced. He knew there was no way he could come up with a 
good explanation. 

“My flowers—!” Aunt Dee cried. 

“I... uh... I heard someone out here,” Evan started. “But...” 

I’m a terrible liar, he told himself. I’d better not even try to make up a story. 

“Get in the house—this instant!” his aunt growled. “I’m going to have a 
long talk with your parents when they get back. I’m very disappointed in you, 
Evan. Very disappointed.” 

“Sorry,” Evan gulped. He obediently slunk into the house. 

Aunt Dee was talking angrily, scolding him, asking him what he was doing 
outside. 

But he didn’t hear her. He was thinking about the two bulging, throbbing 
bags of blue Monster Blood creatures in the basement. 

We’ll get rid of them in the morning, he told himself. Then everything will 
be okay. Right? 

Right? 

Right. He answered his own question. 



Aunt Dee scolded Evan for a few minutes more. Kermit was already tucked 
into bed when Evan finally entered the darkened bedroom. 

Evan stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. “Did you lock 
up the bags somewhere?” he whispered. 

“No problem,” Kermit replied sleepily. He yawned. “All safe and sound.” 

Evan got undressed quickly, letting his clothes fall to the floor. He began to 
feel sleepy too. The battle against the blue blobs had worn him out. 

He sighed. 

Tomorrow will be better, he thought. Til be able to think more clearly in the 
morning. I’ll figure out a way to get rid of all the Monster Blood creatures. 

He pulled the covers down a few inches and slid into the foldout bed. He 
settled in. Rested his head on the pillow. 

Then he felt the cold, wet creature on his back. 

And he started to scream. 



19 


The dampness spread over the back of Evan’s pajamas. The cold chilled him 
until his skin prickled. 

He leaped up. Whirled around. Let out another cry as the lights flashed on. 

He stared down at a wet washcloth on his sheet. 

And heard Kermit’s high-pitched giggle. 

“Kermit—you jerk!” Evan cried. 

His cousin stood by the light switch, shaking with laughter. 

“Kermit—do you really think this was the best time to play such a mean 
joke?” Evan demanded, his heart still pounding. 

Kermit shrugged. “Guess not.” Then he started giggling all over again. 

Evan angrily grabbed up the cold, wet washcloth and heaved it at his 
cousin. “Let’s get some sleep,” he growled. “We have a lot to do tomorrow. And 
it’s no joke.” 


* * * 


Evan dreamed about blue balloons. There were dozens of them in the dream, and 
they grew bigger and bigger. 

The balloons floated above him, their long strings hanging down. Evan 
tried to capture the balloons by grabbing the strings. 

But as he held on, the strings turned into wriggling snakes. 

Evan tried to let go, but the snakes wrapped around his hands. And the huge 
blue balloons lifted him off the ground and carried him higher and higher—until 
they popped. 

And he woke up. 

Morning sunlight washed into the bedroom. Evan felt tired and shaky, as if 
he hadn’t slept at all. He glanced across the room at his cousin. 

Kermit had kicked all his blankets off onto the floor. He slept at the foot of 
his bed, twisted like a pretzel. 

He probably had bad dreams too, Evan thought. 

He spotted the wet washcloth on the floor. 

Good! Evan said to himself. Kermit deserves bad dreams! 



But as he pulled on jeans and a sweatshirt, a heavy feeling of dread swept 
over Evan. 

The Monster Blood creatures. They were down in the basement. Waiting. 
How can we get rid of them? Evan asked himself. Should we tell Aunt 
Dee? Should we call the police? 

He stared at himself in the mirror as he brushed his teeth. His eyes were 
bloodshot. He had dark circles around them. 

He shook Kermit’s shoulders and woke him up. “Huh?” Kermit groaned. 
He squinted hard at Evan, as if he didn’t recognize him. 

“Wake up,” Evan ordered. “We have a job to do—remember?” 

Kermit blinked several times. Without his big red glasses, his eyes looked 

tiny. 

“We have to dump those trash bags somewhere,” Evan reminded him. 

“I have an idea,” Kermit replied. 

They hurried to the kitchen. Aunt Dee had left a note on the refrigerator. 
She went early to the garden store to buy new flowers for her garden. She told 
the boys to make cereal for breakfast. 

But Evan didn’t feel like eating. His stomach felt as if it were filled with 

lead. 

“We’ll eat after we take care of the blobs,” he told Kermit. 

Kermit nodded solemnly. He led the way to the basement stairs. 

“Where did you hide the trash bags?” Evan asked as they started down the 
steps. 

“I locked them in the little bathroom,” Kermit replied. 

“Huh?” Evan let out a gasp. He grabbed Kermit and spun him around. 
“Isn’t there a sink in that bathroom? And a toilet? And water pipes?” 

“Well... yeah,” Kermit replied. “But the creatures are in bags—remember?” 
“Plastic bags!” Evan reminded him. “They probably chewed through those 
bags in seconds!” 

Kermit’s mouth dropped open. “Do you think so?” 

They stopped outside the bathroom door. Evan pressed his ear to the door, 
listening hard. “Uh-oh,” he murmured. “I think I hear running water.” 

“Oh, wow.” Kermit shook his head. “Oh, wow. Oh, wow. I just remembered 
something else.” 

“Something else?” Evan narrowed his eyes on his cousin. “What else did 
you just remember?” 



Kermit swallowed. “Uh... well... I just remembered that this bathroom is 
where I hid the bottle that has my hair-growing formula.” 

“Oh, nooooo,” Evan moaned. 

“I didn’t want anyone to find it,” Kermit explained. “No one ever uses this 
bathroom. So I hid it in here.” 

Evan pressed his ear to the bathroom door again. He reached for the knob. 
“No—don’t!” Kermit cried. 

“We have no choice,” Evan told him. 

He pulled open the door. 



20 


“Oh, nooooo!” Evan screamed. 

He tried to slam the door shut. But Monster Blood creatures bounced into 
the doorway, blocking the door. 

“There are hundreds of them!” Kermit shrieked. “And—and they’re all 
hairy \” 

As the big blobs bounced past the two boys into the basement, Evan gaped 
into the little bathroom in shock. 

Dozens and dozens of the blobs bounced and drank and growled and 
chomped their pointy teeth. Their sleek blue skin was now covered in thick tufts 
of long black hair. 

Water poured from the sink faucets. The hairy blue creatures bobbed over 
the sink, gulping thirstily. Others hovered over the toilet, drinking their fill. 

Evan gripped the doorknob so hard, his hand ached. He stared into the 
room, too horrified to move. 

“The walls...” he murmured in a trembling whisper. “Oh, no. The walls...” 

The walls and ceiling and floor were covered with a layer of oozing blue 
slime. The pipe under the sink had been chewed clear through. Creatures bobbed 
beneath it, sucking up water. Others drank from puddles on the slime-covered 
floor. 

“What are we going to—” Kermit started. 

He didn’t finish his sentence. A deafening POP rocked the little room as 
two Monster Blood creatures exploded to become four. A wave of cold, wet 
slime washed over Evan and Kermit. 

Evan staggered back as several growling creatures bounced out of the 
bathroom. He saw three others pushing their way out through the basement 
window. Two were bouncing on the stairs. 

“We’ve got to stop them!” he cried as another explosion and another flying 
wave of slime shook the room. 

“But how?” Kermit whined. 

Evan didn’t have a chance to answer. A wet blue blob leaped onto his 
shoulder. With an angry snarl, it sank its teeth into Evan’s sweatshirt. 

Evan uttered a groan of pain. “It—it’s sucking...” he stammered. 



He ducked, swung around. And batted it away with a hard punch. 

The creature roared furiously—and dove for Kermit. 

Kermit dodged away—and fell over a hairy blue blob. “Help me—!” he 
cried out as he landed on his back in a thick slime puddle. “They’re totally fierce 
now!” 

Kermit is right, Evan realized. There’s nothing cute about these creatures 
now. They are ferocious—and deadly. 

POP! POP! 

And there are more of them every second! 

Evan ducked away from another attacking creature. He reached both hands 
out and pulled Kermit to his feet. 

“They’re all getting away!” Evan declared. 

“Maybe we should let them!” Kermit declared. 

Evan glared at his cousin. “Do you want to be responsible for wrecking the 
whole town? OWWWW!” He cried out as a hairy blob bit into his ankle. 

Evan kicked the creature away. 

Kermit shook his head. “They drank up all my hair-growing formula. I’ll 
never be able to mix it right again.” 

We were going to use it for my revenge against Conan, Evan thought 
bitterly. Well... forget that idea. 

“We don’t have time to worry about your hair formula,” Evan told his 
cousin. 

POP! 

Another wave of slime slapped the bathroom wall. 

“If they keep multiplying and multiplying,” Evan said, “they could 
outnumber the people in this town. They could drink up the whole water supply. 
Drain all the flowers and plants. They could keep spreading and spreading—and 
drink up the entire country!” 

Kermit gulped. “And it would be all my fault. I opened the can.” 

The growls and snarls and chomps of jagged teeth were deafening. Hairy 
blue creatures bounced out the window, up the steps, all around the basement. 

“We have to get rid of them somehow,” Evan moaned. “No. We can’t just 
get rid of them. We have to kill them!” 

“Oh, wow,” Kermit muttered. Then his expression brightened. “I have an 
idea!” he declared. 



21 


“My electric fence! ” he cried. “If we can herd them to the backyard, we can zap 
them with the electricity. Maybe it will dry them up!” 

“Hey—!” Evan exclaimed. “Maybe it will. It’s worth a try.” Then he 
hesitated. “How do we get them to the backyard?” 

Kermit shrugged. 

POP! Another blob exploded into two. 

Evan covered his ears to block out the angry growls and roars. He glanced 
frantically around the basement. And spotted several brooms and mops leaning 
against the wall near the laundry room. 

“Come on—let’s round them up!” he told Kermit. 

He grabbed a broom and handed another one to his cousin. The two of them 
began swinging the brooms, batting the hairy blobs, poking them, moving them 
out. 

The creatures squealed in protest. But their balloonlike shape made them 
easy to bat and shove along. 

It seemed to Evan to take hours. By the time they herded the last of the 
stragglers into the backyard, his arms ached and his sweatshirt was drenched 
with sweat. 

“What’s going on? What on earth are you doing?” Andy came running 
across the yard. She wore bright green leggings and a purple sweater. She 
goggled as she saw how many bouncing blobs the boys were herding. 

“Yuck!” she groaned. “They’re all hairy! Sick!” 

“They’re out of control!” Kermit declared. “And it’s all my fault!” 

Weird, Evan thought. Kermit never takes the blame for anything. Maybe 
he’s growing up. 

“That’s why I came up with a brilliant plan to kill them!” Kermit declared. 

Same old Kermit, Evan thought. 

“We’re going to zap them,” Evan told Andy breathlessly. “On the invisible 
fence!” 

“You’re going to shock them to death?” she cried, staring at the bouncing, 
growling monsters. 

“It’s worth a try,” Evan gasped. He slapped a blob into line with a swing of 



his broom. The black hair over its body stiffened and stood straight up. It tried to 
bite the broom handle. But Evan slapped it away with another swing. 

“Get ready!” Kermit cried. He swung his broom back and forth, frantically 
trying to keep the angry creatures in line. 

“Okay! Push them! Push them forward—into the invisible fence!” 

Evan swung his broom hard. 

The blobs bounced forward, squealing and growling, snapping their teeth. 

Forward. Forward. Toward the edge of the yard. 

Will it work? Evan wondered. Will the jolt of electricity destroy the ugly, 
destructive things? 



22 


He swung the broom hard, batting the monsters forward. 

Swung it again. 

They bobbed and bounced over the low shrubs that divided the yards. 

On into Conan Barber’s backyard. 

“Nooooooo!” Kermit let out a cry and slapped his forehead. “The switch! I 
forgot to turn it on again!” 

Creatures bounced into the next yard. Beneath the tufts of black hair, their 
skin glowed bright blue in the morning sunlight. 

“You jerk!” Evan shrieked at his cousin. “How could you forget again? 
How could you?” 

Andy plopped down on the grass, lowering her head and uttering an 
unhappy sigh. 

Kermit fumbled in his back pocket for the fence control. He finally tugged 
it out and pressed the red button to turn on the power. 

ZZZAAAAAP! 

Evan shrieked and leaped into the air as a powerful shock jolted through 

him. 

“I told you not to stand there!” Kermit cried. 

Evan jumped aside. 

“I turned it up all the way!” Kermit declared. 

“Too late,” Evan muttered. 

The Monster Blood creatures had all bounced and rolled into the next 
backyard. 

Conan’s yard. 

“Oh, no,” Evan moaned softly. “Here comes more trouble.” 

All three of them gasped as Conan came lumbering across his yard, a can of 
Coke in one hand, his other hand balled into a tight, angry fist. 



23 


“Conan—go back!” Evan warned. But his voice came out tiny and weak. He 
knew that Conan couldn’t hear him over the growls and snarls of the Monster 
Blood creatures. 

“What’s the big idea?” Conan boomed. “It’s not my birthday! Get these 
balloons out of my yard!” 

“Get back! Get back!” Evan tried to warn him. 

Kermit and Andy stood frozen, watching Conan storm toward the bouncing, 
evil blobs. 

Evan waved frantically with both hands. “Get back—!” 

Conan scowled at him. “Are you ordering me around in my own yard?” 

“But—but—” Evan sputtered. 

Conan kicked at one of the creatures. “Whoa. This balloon has hair on it!” 

He bent to pick the creature up—and it jumped onto his arm. With a growl, 
it swallowed Conan’s Coke can. 

“Hey—!” Conan protested. 

The creature started to swell up from the liquid. 

Conan struggled to shake it off. But it clung tightly to his arm. 

And then, with a loud, wet POP, it exploded. 

Thick slime splashed over Conan’s face. He spluttered, thrashed his arms 
out in surprise. Wiped the slimy goo from his eyes. 

And blinked at two hairy, round creatures clinging to his arm. 

“Get these off me!” he shrieked. 

With a furious cry, he swung his free arm—and batted the two blobs 
together. They made a loud SQUISH as they collided with each other. And they 
dropped to the ground. 

Another creature bit into Conan’s leg. Conan stumbled and tripped over 
another one. 

He pulled himself up quickly, glaring furiously at Kermit. “You invented 
these hairy things—didn’t you!” he accused. “Don’t even answer. It’s some kind 
of lab experiment—right? I know this is your kind of thing.” 

“No. Listen—” Kermit started weakly. 



Another Monster Blood creature exploded, sending a wave of cold slime 
over Conan. 

He spluttered again and tried to wipe it away. Then he shook a fist at them. 
“It’ll be payback time—real soon,” he threatened. “Payback time!” 

And he slunk back toward his house, covered in slime. 

Evan breathed a sigh of relief. We have enough problems without having 
Conan in our face, he thought. 

Of course, Conan will be back. But we can’t worry about that now. 

He gazed over the backyards. The Monster Blood creatures were spreading 
out over the entire block. 

What are we going to do? Evan wondered. 

He turned back to the house. “Hey—Aunt Dee is home!” he cried. 

“When did she get back?” Kermit wondered. 

“We have to tell her what’s happened,” Andy urged. “We need help. We 
can’t round these creatures up on our own.” 

The three of them took off, running across the slime-puddled grass to the 
back door. A few seconds later, they burst breathlessly into the kitchen. 

Kermit’s mom had her back to them. She was stirring a long spoon in a big 
aluminum pot on the stove. She turned as the storm door slammed. 

“What’s up, guys?” She smiled at them. 

“We need help!” Kermit blurted out. 

Aunt Dee’s smile faded. “Help? What’s wrong?” She turned back to the 
stove. “Keep talking. I just have to stir this. I’m mixing up a new batch of 
spaghetti with hot sauce for my reading club tonight.” 

“We have a real problem. Andy found a can of Monster Blood, and Kermit 
opened it,” Evan told her, all in one breath. 

“That’s nice,” Aunt Dee replied, frowning at her hot sauce. She sniffed and 
peered down into the steaming pot. “I think it needs more peppers.” 

“Mom—you’ve got to listen !” Kermit pleaded. 

“I am listening,” she insisted, stirring harder. “Go on with your story.” 

“It’s not a story. It’s real,” Evan told her. 

Still stirring, she glanced back at him. “I hope there isn’t any serious 
trouble, Evan. You are in charge, you know. Being out in the middle of the night 
and ruining my flower garden is enough trouble for one visit. When I tell your 
parents—” 

“Mom, please !” Kermit begged. 



“I’m afraid we do have more trouble,” Andy told her. 

“The Monster Blood poured out and formed a little blob creature,” Evan 
continued, his voice trembling. “It was cute at first. But it drank a lot of water 
and exploded into two. Then the two exploded into four.” 

Evan glanced out the kitchen window. The creatures were rolling and 
bouncing all over the backyard. Some of them had discovered the garden hose 
and were soaking up water, inflating rapidly. 

Several of them were forcing their way into the big wooden doghouse in a 
corner of the yard. 

Oh, no, Evan thought. That’s where I stashed the Super-Soakers. Plenty of 
water for them in Dogface’s house. 

“Now there are hundreds of them, Mom,” Kermit continued the story. “And 
they’re not cute anymore. They’ve grown hair, and they’ve turned really fierce. 
They’re spreading out all over the neighborhood, and—” 

“That’s nice,” Aunt Dee said absently, frowning at her hot sauce. 

“Mom—just take a look at them!” Kermit pleaded. “Look out the window. 
Now!” 

“I can’t right now,” she replied. “I have to stir—” 

The phone rang. 

She handed the long wooden spoon to Evan. “I’ve been waiting for that 
call. Stir for me till I get back, okay?” 

Before Evan could reply, she ran from the kitchen. 

“I don’t think she heard us,” Kermit said, shaking his head unhappily. “If 
only she would take one look out the window. Then maybe...” His voice drifted 
off. 

Evan sighed and stirred the sauce. The steam rising up from the pot burned 
his eyes. “This stuff is deadly!” he declared. 

And that gave him an idea. 

He glanced out the window in time to see a wet explosion of slime from the 
doghouse. The creatures had found the Super-Soakers. More of them had 
clustered around the little wooden structure. 

He turned to Kermit and Andy. “Let’s try Aunt Dee’s hot sauce,” he 
whispered. 

“Excuse me?” Kermit and Andy stared at him, confused. 

“You want to eat now?” Kermit asked. “I thought you hated Mom’s hot 
sauce.” 



“I do,” Evan admitted, still whispering. “Because it kills\” 

“I get it!” Andy declared, her dark eyes widening in excitement. “You think 
maybe the hot sauce will kill the Monster Blood creatures.” 

Evan nodded. “It’s liquid. So they’ll try to drink it. And maybe it will be too 
hot for them to handle.” 

“Maybe it will blow them up for good!” Andy exclaimed. 

“Worth a try, I guess,” Kermit said softly. 

Evan glanced to the door. No sign of Aunt Dee. 

“Quick—” he whispered. “Help me carry the pot outside.” 



24 


Evan grabbed two pot holders off the counter and handed one to Andy. Then 
they each grabbed a handle on the top of the big stew pot and lifted it carefully 
off the stove. 

“It weighs a ton,” Andy groaned. 

“Mom likes to make a lot of hot sauce,” Kermit explained. “She keeps the 
extra sauce in the freezer. For emergencies, I guess.” 

He held the back door open. Evan and Andy, hoisting the steaming pot 
between them, carried it out the door. 

Evan raised his eyes to the backyard and let out a cry. “We may be too 
late,” he moaned. “There are so many of them!” 

Squinting into the sunlight, he thought he saw thousands of them! They 
bounced and rolled over the backyards. They growled and grunted. 

They gulped water from the garden hose. Dozens of them were bouncing 
through a neighbor’s flower bed, drinking the plants dry. 

Two houses down, Monster Blood creatures had gathered in a small, 
backyard goldfish pond. They were busily drinking the pond dry. Some of them 
were sucking the liquid out of the goldfish! 

“Too late,” Evan murmured. “We’re just too late.” 

“It might work,” Andy said, not very enthusiastically. “If we can get them 
to drink it.” 

“I—I have to set it down,” Evan told her. “The handle is hot. My hand is 
burning.” 

“Mine too,” Andy replied. 

They set the steaming stew pot down on the grass in the center of the yard. 

“Now how do we get them to try it?” Kermit asked. Without waiting for an 
answer, he cupped his hands around his mouth and began shouting, “Come and 
get it! Come and get it!” 

Evan grabbed him and pulled him back. “I don’t think they speak English,” 
he told Kermit, rolling his eyes. 

“Let’s back away from the pot and let them discover it on their own,” Andy 
suggested. 

“Good idea,” Evan replied. He tugged Kermit back some more. “They 



haven’t had any trouble finding liquid everywhere. If we step back a bit, they’ll 
discover the hot sauce.” 

The three of them backed toward the garage, keeping their eyes on the pot 
of hot sauce. 

Monster Blood creatures bounced over three or four backyards, sucking up 
any liquid they could find. Flower beds lay wilted and dead. Large patches of 
grass were brown and dry. 

Will they find the hot sauce? Evan wondered. 

Will they try it? Will it destroy them? 

It nearly destroyed me! he remembered. It burned my lips and took all the 
skin off the roof of my mouth! 

Will it burn up the hairy blue blobs? 

The spicy aroma of the hot sauce drifted to Evan’s nose. You can probably 
smell it all over the backyards, he guessed. 

He stared without blinking at the aluminum pot gleaming in the sunlight. 
And he crossed his fingers, hoping his idea would work. 

As he watched, a few Monster Blood creatures turned toward the pot. Their 
round eyes bulged. They began bobbing up and down, as if excited. 

Then they started to bounce toward the hot sauce. 

“Yesssss!” Evan whispered. “Yessss!” 

But before the creatures could reach the pot, another figure came bounding 
into the backyard. 

Evan was concentrating so hard, at first he didn’t recognize the big 
sheepdog. But Kermit’s cries made Evan realize what was happening. 

“Dogface—get away!” Kermit cried frantically. “Dogface—no! Go home, 
boy! Dogface—go home!” 

But the big dog ignored Kermit’s cries. Wagging his stub of a tail furiously, 
he trotted toward the shining hot sauce pot. 



25 


“Dogface—get away!” Kermit cried, frantically waving the big sheepdog back. 

Panting hard, his pink tongue hanging down from his furry face, Dogface 
bounded up to the hot sauce pot. Ignoring Kermit’s desperate cries, he lowered 
his head to the pot and sniffed it. 

“No! Go away! Go away!” Evan joined in on Kermit’s cries. “Get him 
away from there!” 

They couldn’t move fast enough. 

The big dog bumped the pot over. The orange hot sauce poured out over the 
grass. 

Dogface lowered his head and licked up a few tastes. 

Blue Monster Blood creatures bounced closer. A few began hungrily 
drinking up the spilled hot sauce. 

Evan waited and watched, his fingers crossed so hard, they hurt. 

No. No. 

The hot sauce didn’t bother the hairy blue blobs a bit. 

But Dogface raised his head from the ground. Behind his thick fur, his 
black eyes rolled crazily. The big dog opened his jaws in a long howl of pain. 

And as he howled, a growling blue blob leaped onto the dog’s back. 

Stunned and in pain, Dogface shook himself hard. But the creature clung to 
the fur on his back. 

“No! Get away!” Evan shrieked as another blob leaped onto Kermit’s dog. 

With another howl, the big dog took off. His big paws pounded the grass. 
He shook himself as he ran, trying to throw off the two creatures. 

Kermit stood openmouthed in shock. 

“The blobs are drinking up all the hot sauce!” Andy declared. “And now 
they’re biting and snapping at each other! It’s turning them even meaner!” 

“Come on!” Evan cried, running after the dog. “We’ve got to save Dogface! 
Those creatures will kill him!” 

Evan took a deep breath and started running full speed, following the 
howling dog. Kermit and Andy ran right behind him. 

“Dogface—whoa!” Kermit called. “Dogface—stop! Stop!” 



But, as always, the dog ignored Kermit. 

Shaking his back, he ran in crazy zigzags. 

Through backyards. And then across a street. And onto the sidewalk. 

The dog barked and howled in protest. But the two blobs hung on, 
appearing to enjoy the ride. 

“Dogface—wait!” Kermit pleaded. 

The three kids ran as fast as they could, zigzagging across streets and yards, 
following the barking, frightened dog. 

As they neared the school, Evan glanced back. And saw that the Monster 
Blood creatures were following them. Dozens of them, bouncing and rolling 
over the front yards. 

They were growling and snapping at everything in their path. One of them 
exploded, sending a spray of slime over someone’s front yard. 

“They’re all following us!” Evan cried breathlessly. 

Kermit and Andy turned back. “Oh, wow!” Kermit muttered. “It’s like a 
parade!” 

“Hey—what’s that?” Evan heard a woman shout. “What are you kids 
doing?” 

“Hey—get off my grass!” He heard a man’s angry cry. 

He heard startled voices. And saw people bursting out of their houses. Two 
kids jumped off their bikes and stared. A man on a ladder cried out in surprise 
and nearly toppled to the ground. 

“Dogface—please stop !” Kermit wailed. 

But the big dog galloped across the street, heading to the playground behind 
the school. Just past the sidewalk, he stopped and began rubbing his back against 
a wide tree trunk. 

The hairy blobs on the dog’s back bounced and scraped against the rough 
tree bark. But they held on tight. 

With another howl, Dogface took off, running wildly across the softball 
field, kicking up dust in the infield, bucking his head, shaking his whole body. 

And then the big dog slumped to the ground. 

The three kids gasped as Dogface toppled onto his side. 

The two blobs had their mouths buried in the dog’s thick fur. 

Dogface kicked out once with all four legs. 

And then didn’t move. 



26 


“They killed him! They killed him!” Kermit screamed. 

“No!” Evan cried. “He’s still breathing!” 

Sprawled on his side, the big dog’s chest heaved. The ugly creatures gulped 
hard, bobbing on top of the dog’s thick fur. 

Evan and Andy dove for the dog. Evan grabbed one of the drinking 
creatures in both hands. He twisted it hard—then tugged it off. 

The blob opened its wet mouth in an angry roar. It snapped its blue jaws at 
Evan. 

Evan raised it up and heaved it into the sea of bobbing blue creatures that 
swarmed over the playground. 

Then he turned to Andy. She struggled to pull off the remaining blob. 

She gave a hard pull. “Yuck! This hair is so gross!” she wailed. Her hands 
slid off, and she stumbled back. 

Dogface uttered a weak groan. The dog’s big eyes rolled crazily in his head. 

Evan grabbed the hairy blob. He twisted it hard, the way he twisted the first 
one. He pulled up with all his strength. 

The creature lifted off Dogface with a loud POP. It snarled furiously and 
snapped its jaws over Evan’s wrist. 

“OWWW!” Evan howled in pain. 

He turned and heaved the ugly creature as high and far as he could. It 
bounced off a tree limb, then fell into the crowd of bobbing Monster Blood 
creatures. 

Dogface climbed quickly to his feet. He shook himself hard. He seemed to 
be okay. 

Kermit squatted down to hug him. 

Evan gazed over the playground. Monster Blood creatures swarmed over 
the softball field, over the volleyball courts, over the whole block! 

People came out of houses and came running to the playground. Evan heard 
the wail of a siren—and saw a black-and-white police cruiser turn the corner. It 
squealed to a halt, and two dark-uniformed officers came scrambling out. 

Andy bumped up against Evan. “Bad news,” she said, frowning. “I don’t 
think we can keep this a secret anymore.” 



Evan shook his head. He knew Andy was making a joke. But this was no 
time to be funny. 

He had been in trouble before. He had the whole town chasing him last 
year, when Monster Blood had turned him into a giant. 

And now, Monster Blood had gotten him in major trouble once again. How 
could he ever explain this? What could the police do against these horrible, 
frightening creatures? 

POP! A fat blob exploded into two. 

Across the playground, people pushed closer to get a better view. 

The creatures were roaring now, roaring like angry tigers. They bit at each 
other and chewed the ground. 

The two police officers were struggling to force their way through the 
angry, bouncing creatures. One of the officers had a phone to his ear. Probably 
calling for more officers, Evan thought. 

Behind him, he heard a weak cry. 

Evan spun around—and gasped. Hairy blobs had leaped onto Kermit. One 
sat on top of Kermit’s blond hair. Two more had climbed to his shoulders. 
Another perched on his back. 

“Help...” Kermit choked out. He thrashed his arms and tried to squirm out 
from under the creatures. 

But they spread out over him, digging their mouths into his skin. 

“Ohhhh.” Kermit uttered a groan and fell to his knees. 

And several more creatures leaped onto him. They made wet sucking noises 
as they covered his body. Kermit disappeared beneath them. 

“YAAAIIII!” 

Evan heard another shrill cry. He turned to see Andy covered in hairy 
creatures too. She swung her fists furiously, trying to bat them away. 

She ducked and squirmed and shook herself. 

But they spread over her shoulders, down her arms. One of them leaped up 
and grabbed on to her hair. It spread itself wetly over her face. 

Evan dove for Kermit. He slipped and landed hard on his knees. He 
grabbed at a blob on Kermit’s shoulder and tugged it. 

It came off with a wet POP. 

Evan grabbed for another one. 

But before he could pull it off, he felt a cold, wet slap on the back of his 
neck. 



Then he felt a heavy, wet blob thump onto his head. Cold slime ran down 
Evan’s face. 

He reached up. Tried to grab the evil thing. 

Too late. 

Two more blobs leaped onto him and attached themselves to his back. 
“Can’t... breathe...” Evan gasped. 

The weight of the creatures pushed him down. 

Down... 

Facedown in the wet grass. 

He dug his elbows into the ground. Tried to push up. Tried to struggle to his 
knees. 

I’ve got to get up, he told himself. I can’t let them cover me like a blanket. 
Like a smothering blanket... 

But the creatures were too heavy. There were too many of them on him. 

He let out a whimper of pain as he felt mouths biting at him. Drinking... 
Choking off his air. Smothering him... 

I’m doomed, Evan realized. 

This time, the Monster Blood got me. This time, the Monster Blood wins.

The creatures covered Evan. Darkness swept over him. 

He struggled to breathe. 

He wondered if Kermit and Andy were being smothered beside him. 

He sucked in a mouthful of air. A cold, wet blob pressed over his face. Evan 
couldn’t let the air out. 

He heard a rush, a buzz in his ears. 

The sound of my own blood, he thought. My own blood pulsing through 
my veins. 

He suddenly felt lighter. 

I’m fading, he thought. 

He let out the mouthful of air. 

Hey—the creature moved away from my face! Evan realized. 

What’s going on? 

He raised his head—and saw an amazing sight. 

Kermit and Andy were climbing to their feet. The blobs had moved away 
from them. They had moved away—to fight the other blobs. 

They’re all fighting each other! Evan saw. 

Furious growls rose over the playground as the creatures bit each other, 
tugged at hair, at slimy blue flesh, dug their pointy teeth into each other. 

With a groan, Evan climbed to his knees. He shook off his dizziness and 
gazed at the incredible scene. 

“They’re swallowing each other!” Andy gasped. “They turned so mean, 
they’re going after each other'.” 

She’s right, Evan realized. They’re getting meaner and meaner. So mean, 
they’re destroying each other! 

Kermit picked up his glasses from the ground. He wiped off some blades of 
grass, then slid them over his face. “I don’t believe it!” he cried, watching the 
creatures devour each other. 

In minutes, the blobs had eaten each other. They had completely vanished. 

The grass was covered with slime and wet tufts of black hair. 

The last blob left rolled over and died, its blue flesh ripped to shreds. But 



nothing else remained of the hundreds of creatures. 

Not a trace. 

Evan stood up shakily. He dusted himself off. Squinting into the sunlight, 
he looked around. 

Groups of neighborhood people talked excitedly. They shook their heads 
and shrugged their shoulders as they talked, trying to make sense of the whole 
thing. 

I could make sense of it for them, Evan thought. But they’d never believe 
me. 

He turned to Kermit and Andy. “Are you okay?” 

They nodded. Andy pulled a chunk of slime from her dark hair. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Kermit said. 

But before Evan could move, a shadow fell over him. 

He turned and stared up at the two grim-faced police officers. “You again,” 
one of them accused, narrowing his dark eyes at Evan. 

“I... I...” Evan stammered. 

“I think you three kids are in big trouble,” the other officer said softly. 

“Trouble?” Evan choked out. “Why? What did we do?” 

The officers gazed around the playground. 

“What did we do?” Kermit repeated shrilly. “We didn’t do anything wrong. 
We didn’t commit any crime.” 

“There’s nothing here,” Andy added. “Look around. There’s nothing here to 
blame us for.” 

“Well...” The officers hesitated. 

One of them picked up a slimy wad of black hair from the grass. “How 
about littering?” he asked his partner. “I think we can charge them with 
littering.” 

“Let’s forget about it,” the other officer muttered. He turned to the three 
kids. “Go on. Go home. Let’s forget any of this ever happened.” 

I hope I can, Evan thought as he turned and started jogging away with the 
others. 

I hope I can forget about it. 

“That was a close one,” Kermit said softly as they jogged across the street. 

“Yeah. A close one,” Andy repeated. 

“I just feel bad I never got to look at one of those guys under a 
microscope,” Kermit said. 



“Yuck,” Andy murmured. Her whole body shivered. “I keep thinking about 
that disgusting hair on their bodies. It felt so wet and slimy when it brushed 
against your skin.” 

“What a waste of good hair-growing formula!” Kermit grumbled. 

“Let’s stop talking about it,” Evan suggested. “That policeman is right. We 
should try to forget the whole thing.” 

They didn’t say a word for the rest of the way back. Evan started to feel 
better as Kermit’s house came into view. 

Maybe this horrible adventure is over, he told himself. 

But his heart sank, and a heavy feeling of dread swept over him when he 
saw Aunt Dee waiting for them on the front stoop. 

“Evan, you are responsible,” she said sternly, narrowing her eyes angrily at 
him. “I want a full explanation.” 

“Well...” Evan didn’t know where to begin. 

“I shouldn’t have opened the can of Monster Blood,” Kermit told her. 

“That’s what started it,” Evan said. “Then the blue creatures started 
exploding, and—” 

“Stop right now!” Aunt Dee ordered, raising her hand in a halt sign. “I 
don’t want to hear about your silly blue creatures. If you want to waste your time 
on fantasy games, that’s your business.” 

She crossed her arms in front of her and glared at Evan angrily. “I want to 
know what happened to my pot of hot sauce!” 

“Huh?” Evan gasped. 

The whole town was nearly overrun by gross, water-sucking monsters. And 
all she cares about is her precious hot sauce! 

“I’m waiting,” Aunt Dee said sternly, tapping her foot. 

“Well...” Evan started. 

What can I tell her? he asked himself, thinking hard. What can I say? 

“Evan took your hot sauce,” Kermit chimed in. “He ate it, Mom. Evan 
loves your hot sauce. He ate the whole pot himself.” 

I don’t believe this! Evan groaned to himself. After all we’ve been through, 
the little rat just got me in trouble again! 

But to Evan’s surprise, he found Aunt Dee smiling at him. “Evan, I’m so 
flattered,” she said. “I didn’t know you liked it so much. I’ll make you a big pot 
of it every time you come for a visit!” 

“Uh... great,” Evan replied weakly. 



“Go get my stew pot. Then come inside for lunch,” she instructed them. She 
disappeared into the house. 

Evan led the way around to the back. He scowled at Kermit. “I can’t believe 
you told your mom that.” 

Kermit shrugged. “It was the only thing I could think of.” 

Evan gazed around the backyard. The flower garden was dead and dry. Big 
patches of grass lay brown and flat. 

The stew pot sat on its side in the middle of the yard. 

Evan started toward it—but stopped with a startled cry as a figure staggered 
out from behind the garage. 

A hulking creature with glowing red eyes! 



28 


“Whoa!” Evan exclaimed. 

Kermit and Andy huddled close to him as the creature lumbered into view. 

As it stepped into the bright sunlight, Evan saw that it wasn’t a creature at 
all. The three of them were staring at a man in a white work suit. 

The work suit looked like the kind of space suit worn by astronauts. It 
covered the man from head to foot. The man’s face was completely covered too. 
He peered out at them through bright red goggles. 

“Who—who are you?” Evan managed to choke out. 

The man stopped halfway across the yard. He stared out at them, his eyes 
dark behind the red goggles. Finally, he lifted a gloved hand and pulled back his 
hood. 

He removed the goggles, took a few deep breaths, and pushed his curly 
black hair off his forehead. “No blue creatures here?” he asked, looking around. 
“I guess I didn’t need the safety suit.” 

“Who—who are you?” Evan stammered again. 

“I’m looking for my little blue guys,” the man replied. “I heard there was 
quite a fuss at the playground. The police said you might be able to help me.” 

“Those are your creatures?” Andy cried. 

The man nodded. “Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Professor Eric Crane. 
From the Science Institute downtown.” He glanced once again around the yard. 
“Do you have the can?” 

“I—I kept it in the garage,” Evan told him. “But how do we know it’s 
yours? Who are you? Why are you wearing that uniform?” 

“Did you really invent those disgusting blue blobs?” Andy demanded. 

The man took a few steps toward them. The safety uniform was so big and 
bulky, he walked awkwardly and slowly. 

“Bring me the can, and I’ll explain,” he told them. 

Evan obediently brought the plastic can from the garage. He put it into 
Professor Crane’s gloved hand. 

“Those creatures—they got meaner and meaner,” Andy told him. “They got 
so mean, they ate each other up.” 

The professor sighed. “I know,” he said. “That’s why I threw them away. 



My underwater fighting force was a total failure.” 

“Excuse me?” Evan cried. “Fighting force?” 

“I developed the blue liquid in my lab,” Professor Crane explained. “It was 
supposed to be a monster fighting force. For underwater combat. A special army 
of fighters who would get meaner and meaner, and multiply underwater until 
they outnumbered the enemy.” 

“Cool idea,” Kermit murmured. And then he added, “I guess.” 

Professor Crane shrugged. “But it didn’t work. They get too mean. It was a 
bad experiment.” 

He glanced down at the can in his gloved hand. “But I should have been 
more careful when I tossed the can out. Much more careful.” The professor 
shook his head. “I spent ten years on this. Ten years and fifty million dollars. All 
a waste. All a total waste.” 

With a bitter sigh, he started to pull the lid off the can. 

But he let out a startled cry as Dogface bumped him from behind. The big 
sheepdog ran hard into Professor Crane—and the Monster Blood can flew out of 
his hand. 

Evan watched it bounce over a low shrub and roll to a stop in Conan’s yard. 

“That’s okay,” Evan told him. “It’s empty.” 

Professor Crane shrugged and uttered another unhappy sigh. “Ten years...” 
he murmured. “Ten years...” 

Shaking his head, he stomped off. He turned back to them when he reached 
the driveway. “You won’t tell anyone about this, will you?” he called. “It would 
be very embarrassing to me if you did.” 

“No problem,” Evan replied. 

He watched the scientist lumber down the drive. Then Evan turned back to 
Kermit and Andy. 

For some reason, Kermit was giggling. 

“What’s so funny?” Evan asked. 

Kermit pointed. “Look. Conan came running out. He discovered the 
Monster Blood can.” 

“But it’s empty—isn’t it?” Evan cried. “Isn’t it?” 

He started to run toward Conan. But Kermit held him back. 

“Kermit—let me go!” Evan demanded. “We have to warn Conan. That stuff 
is dangerous. If there is any of it left in there, and he opens it—” 

“I think there’s a tiny bit left in the can,” Kermit told Evan. “You wanted 



your revenge—didn’t you? This is perfect. Conan will let the stuff out, and in a 
few minutes he’ll have bouncing blue blobs to take care of.” 

“But—but—” Evan sputtered. 

“It’ll be funny,” Andy agreed. “Conan will be terrified. He won’t know 
what to do with them. They’ll suck up his whole yard. It’s a great revenge, Evan. 
And it’s harmless. They’ll just eat each other in the end.” 

“Meanwhile, Conan will have the most frightening time of his life,” Kermit 
added gleefully. 

“Okay, okay,” Evan agreed. “You’re right. It’s pretty funny. Let’s not warn 
him.” 

“Lunchtime! Come on in, you guys!” Aunt Dee called from the kitchen 

door. 

Evan glanced back as he followed the others into the house. Conan had the 
blue can in his hands. He popped open the lid. 

Evan giggled to himself and went in to lunch. 

After lunch, they carried the dishes into the kitchen and loaded them in the 
dishwasher. “What do you want to do this afternoon?” Kermit asked. “How 
about some experiments in my lab?” 

“No way!” Andy replied. 

Evan heard Conan calling them. “Hey, you three! Hey, guys!” Conan 
shouted from the backyard. 

Evan led the way out the door. He couldn’t keep a smile from spreading 
across his face. Conan probably wants us to help him round up the blue blobs, he 
thought. 

But to his surprise, he saw no blue blobs in the backyard. 

“What’s going on?” Evan asked Conan. 

Conan grinned at him. “I found that blue candy of yours,” he said. 

“Huh? Blue candy?” Evan gasped. 

Conan nodded. “Yeah. You remember. That candy you wouldn’t share with 
me the other night. I found it and I ate it. It was pretty good. Sticky, but good.” 

“But—but—” Evan sputtered. 

“Now I just have two small problems,” Conan continued. “For one thing, I 
can’t stop drinking water.” 

“What’s the other problem?” Evan asked in a trembling voice. 

“Look,” Conan replied. He waved toward his backyard. 



And a figure came running out from the house. 

Another Conan! 

That Conan was followed by two more Conans! 

The four Conans swept around Evan, Kermit, and Andy, and formed a 
circle around them. 

“This is my other problem,” Conan said, narrowing his eyes menacingly at 
Evan. “There are four of us now. And I don’t know why—but we’re feeling 
MEANER than usual!”
