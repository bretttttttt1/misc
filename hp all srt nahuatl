2
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,000
I should have known that you would
stay here, Professor McGonagall.

3
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,400
Good afternoon, Professor Dumbledore.

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,899
Is what they say true, Albus?

5
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,299
I’m afraid, Master.
The good and the bad.

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,799
- And the boy?
- Hagrid brings it.

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,199
Do you think it’s safe to trust Hagrid
with something as serious as this?

8
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Ah, Master, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,299
Professor Dumbledore, my lord.
Professor McGonagall.

10
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,399
- No problem, I believe, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

11
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,200
Baby just slept
as we drove through Bristol.

12
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,400
Try not to encourage it.

13
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,300
There you go.

14
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,199
Albus, do you really think it's okay,
leave with these people?

15
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,699
I look at them all the time.
They are the worst Muggles, imaginable.

16
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,899
- It's true...
- Only one family owned.

17
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,499
This boy is going to be great. There will be no child
in our world who does not know his name.

18
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,999
Exactly.

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,600
He’s much better off growing up
away from all that.

20
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Until he gets better.

21
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,300
There, there, Hagrid.
Not really good, after all.

22
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,700
Good luck...

23
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,800
…Harry Potter.

24
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,400
Up. Get up!

25
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,600
Now!

26
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,600
Wake up, cousin!
We’re going to the zoo!

27
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,100
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Good morning, son.

28
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,999
Why don’t you just cook the food?
and make sure you don’t hide anything.

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,199
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

30
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,299
…for my Dudley’s special day!

31
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,600
- Hurry up! Bring me my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

32
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,900
Aren’t they beautiful, my dear?

33
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,499
- How many are there?
- 36. I counted them myself.

34
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,899
36?! But last year… last year I was 37!

35
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,481
But some of them are very
slightly higher than in the previous year.

36
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:27,999
I don’t care what size they are!

37
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,699
Oh, now, now, now. I'm
what we're going to do...

38
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,400
…when we go out, we buy
you two new gifts. How about that, pumpkin?

39
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,000
It should be an interesting day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

40
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,099
I warn you now, young man.

41
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,699
Anything sad, anything...

42
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,100
…and you won’t have
any meal for a week.

43
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,600
Enter.

44
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,200
Make it move.

45
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,499
Move!

46
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,199
- Move!
- He's asleep!

47
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,000
He is annoying.

48
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,799
Apologize to him.

49
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
He doesn’t understand
which is how it is, sitting there everyday...

50
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,200
…I see people playing
their ugly faces on you.

51
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,600
Can you hear me?

52
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,200
Except, I’ve never talked
with a snake first.

53
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,999
You...?

54
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,400
I mean, do you talk to people often?

55
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,699
You’re from Burma, right?
Was it safe there?

56
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,300
Do you miss your family?

57
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,799
I see. That’s me too.
I never knew my parents.

58
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,100
Mom, Dad, come here! you won’t believe
what this snake is doing!

59
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,099
Thank you.

60
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,900
Whenever possible.

61
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,100
Snake!

62
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,899
Mother! Mother! Help me!

63
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,300
My beloved son!
How did you get in there?

64
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,900
Who did this? How did you get
there? Is there a snake?

65
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,100
All right, brother.
We’ll get you out of these cold clothes.

66
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,699
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

67
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,800
One minute the glass was there an
then it was gone, it was like magic.

68
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,000
There is no such thing as magic.

69
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
And smile!

70
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,499
Vernon, just look!
I can't believe it!

71
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,199
In just one week, it’s off to Smeltings.

72
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,199
Watch out Smeltonia.
The happiest day of my life.

73
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,600
Will I need to add that too?

74
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,900
What is? You? Are you going to Smeltings?

75
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,899
Don't be so stupid! you’re going to
in the state school. Where you live.

76
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,599
This is what you will wear,
when I finish cutting it.

77
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,099
It's Dudley's old clothes.
It will fit me like a piece of old elephant skin.

78
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,699
It will fit you well.

79
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,700
Go get the post. Go!

80
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,199
Marge is sick. They eat a cute dog.

81
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,599
- Dad, look! Harry has a book!
- Give it back! That's mine!

82
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Yours? Who would write to you?

83
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,500
We will no longer send newspapers to this newspaper.

84
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
Have a great day at the office, my friend.

85
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Shoo! Go away.

86
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,200
Good morning, Sunday.

87
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,499
In my opinion, the best time of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

88
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,099
- Why is there no news on Sundays?
"You're right, Harry!"

89
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,200
No word on Sunday.

90
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,500
There are no mystery books these days! No, sir.

91
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,000
No bloody letters. Nothing!

92
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,300
No, sir, it's not a shock, it's sad...

93
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,000
Make it stop, please!

94
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,800
Stop it!

95
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,800
Mom, what’s going on?

96
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Give me that! Give me the book!

97
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,000
Get down!

98
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,900
They are my books! Throw me away!

99
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,800
That's it! We're going far!

100
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,999
Far away where they can't find us!

101
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Dad is already mad, isn’t he?

102
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,800
Make a wish, Harry.

103
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,900
Who's there?

104
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,500
Sorry about that.

105
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,000
Please leave immediately, sir!
You broke in and out!

106
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,700
Relax, Dursley, you big dick.

107
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,299
Remember, I’m not seeing you
because you were a baby, Harry.

108
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,099
But you’re a little further along than I would have
expected. It’s so ’round the corner.

109
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,200
Not even Harry.

110
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,800
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

111
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,999
I’ve got something for you.

112
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,900
I’m afraid I might sit down at some point,
but I think it tastes just as good.

113
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,800
I produced it myself, lyrics and all.

114
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,399
Thank you.

115
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,800
Not every time the boy
He’s 11, now is he?

116
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,999
Excuse me, who are you?

117
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,199
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

118
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,200
- Yes, you know everything about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

119
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,699
No? Blimey, Harry, you never thought about where
did your parents learn everything?

120
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,299
What did you learn?

121
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,100
You’re a wizard, Harry.

122
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,299
- I'm a what?
- A witch.

123
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,599
And one of the best of the best, I’ll add,
after getting used to it a bit.

124
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,699
No, you're wrong.
I mean...

125
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,000
...I can't be a witch.

126
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,400
I mean, this is just Harry. Saint Harry.

127
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,399
Well, except for Harry, ever
will it make any difference?

128
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,300
Everything you couldn’t explain,
when you were angry or scared?

129
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,799
"My brother, Mr. Potter,
We’re excited to announce…

130
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,199
…who welcomed you to
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

131
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,399
He’s not going there! We agreed when
it led to us getting rid of all this garbage.

132
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,799
Did you know? You always knew
and you never told me?

133
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,099
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

134
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,999
My perfect sister was who she was.

135
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,199
Mom and Dad were thrilled
the day he received his letter.

136
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,599
"We have a witch in our family."
Isn’t it wonderful?”

137
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,499
I just saw
for what it was.

138
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,399
A piece!

139
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,599
Then he met the Potter,
and then he got you...

140
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,499
…and I knew you would be too.
Just an odd one, just as abnormal.

141
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,699
And then, if you will, he went and got
he himself was shot down! And we're here with you.

142
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,999
When does it end? You told me
my parents died in a war.

143
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,499
A car crash? Car crash fatal
Lily and James Potter?

144
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,599
- We had to say something.
- It's an addiction! It’s a challenge!

145
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,299
It won’t go away.

146
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,799
Oh, and ​I guess an older Muggle like you
you’ll stop him, won’t you?

147
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,100
Muggle?

148
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,399
Not magic people. This boy had
name since birth.

149
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,499
Going to the best school
of witchcraft and sorcery in the world and...

150
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,599
…he will be under the excellent teacher of
Hogwarts has never seen it, Albus Dumbledore.

151
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,599
I’m not paying to eat some crackpot
old fool teach him magic.

152
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,399
Never underestimate Albus Dumbledore...

153
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,700
...in front of me.

154
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,799
Oh, um, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t tell me
anything at Hogwarts about that.

155
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,200
- Honestly, I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Good.

156
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,500
Ooh, we’re a little behind.
Better luck.

157
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,900
Unless you want to stay, of course.

158
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,800
"First-year students will need
three pieces of work clothes…

159
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,799
...a tree."

160
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,099
A bit of technique, Harry.

161
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,099
"A pair of dragon skin gloves."
Hagrid, you mean about a real dragon?

162
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,600
They don’t mean a penguin, do they?

163
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,800
- Crikey. I would love a dragon.
- You want a dragon?

164
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,900
Animals are so misunderstood, Harry.
It’s very misunderstood.

165
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,099
"Every student should have...

166
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,299
…a measure of 2
tin boiler...

167
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,299
…and they can take it, if they want,
a dog, a cat or a dog."

168
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,099
Can we get all this in London?

169
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,800
If you know where to go.

170
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,399
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I guess?

171
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,499
No thanks, Tom.
I’m on a Hogwarts project.

172
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,899
I’m just rooting for young Harry here
buy her school supplies.

173
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,700
Bless my soul.
It’s Harry Potter!

174
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,399
Come back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

175
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
I can’t believe I’m finally getting to meet you.

176
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,599
Harry Potter. I can’t tell you
I’m so glad to meet you.

177
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,399
Hello, Master. I didn't see you there.

178
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,599
Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He will be yours
Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts.

179
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,299
Oh, nice to meet you.

180
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,499
Scary stuff.

181
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,500
There's no need, is there, Potter?

182
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,499
Yeah, well, he needs to go now.
A lot of shopping.

183
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Goodbye.

184
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,699
- See, Harry? You know yourself.
- But why am I so familiar, Hagrid?

185
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,399
All the people involved,
how do they know who I am?

186
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,500
I don’t know if I’m the right person
to tell you that, Harry.

187
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,300
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

188
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,099
This is where you’ll get your pens and ink.

189
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,300
And there, all your bits and bobs
for doing your magic.

190
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,299
It is the best broom in the world.

191
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,499
Look! The new Nimbus 2000!

192
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,000
It is the fastest model.

193
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,299
But, Hagrid, how am I going to pay for all this?
I don't have any money.

194
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,899
Your money is good, Harry.
Gringotts, the wizarding bank.

195
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,600
There is no safer place, none.
Except maybe Hogwarts.

196
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,199
Hagrid, what exactly
this thing?

197
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,699
They're goblins, Harry. Smart as they come
goblins but not the cutest creatures.

198
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,900
You better stay close.

199
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,600
Mr. Harry Potter wants
to make a payment.

200
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,000
And what does Mr. Harry Potter
has his key?

201
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,200
Oh, wait a minute.
I got it here somewhere.

202
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,799
Ha! Here is the little ghost.

203
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh, and ​there is one more thing too.

204
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,500
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

205
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,700
It’s about You-Know-What
on the ground you know-what.

206
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,900
Very good.

207
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,000
Page 687.

208
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,200
Lamp, please.

209
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
Key, please.

210
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,200
I didn’t think your parents
leaving you with nothing, now did you?

211
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,099
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

212
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,499
I can’t tell you, Harry.
Hogwarts business. Too secretive.

213
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,400
Stand back.

214
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,500
You better not tell anyone about this, Harry.

215
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,699
I still need… a box.

216
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,400
A tree? Well, you’ll want Ollivanders.
There is no better place.

217
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,300
Why don't you run over there and wait? without
i have something else to do. It won’t last long.

218
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,100
Hello?

219
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,900
Hello?

220
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,700
I thought when
I’ll see you, Mr. Potter.

221
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,699
It just appeared yesterday...

222
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:47,800
...what your mother and father were
this is where they buy their first boxes.

223
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,800
Here we are.

224
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,900
Give him a wave.

225
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,900
Apparently not.

226
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Maybe...

227
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,400
...this.

228
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,000
No, no, of course not.
Nothing.

229
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,900
I wonder...

230
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,299
Curious.

231
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,399
I’m very curious.

232
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,800
Sorry, but what do you like?

233
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,799
I remember all the trees
I never sold it, Mr. Potter.

234
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,699
It happens because of the phoenix…

235
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,800
...whose hair is alive
on your cock, you gave him another head.

236
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,099
Just another one.

237
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,699
It’s amazing what it takes
settle in with this box...

238
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,700
…while his brother
he gave you the cut.

239
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,800
And who owns the tree?

240
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,000
We don’t say his name.

241
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,899
The tree chooses
the magician, Mr. Potter.

242
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,200
It’s not always clear why.

243
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,999
But I think it’s pretty cool…

244
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,099
…what we can expect
great things about you.

245
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,599
Finally, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

246
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,499
…did great things.

247
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,800
Terrible...

248
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,500
…yeah, but good.

249
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,200
Harry! Harry!

250
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,900
Happy birthday.

251
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,600
Are you okay, Harry?
You seem very stuck.

252
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,399
He killed my parents, didn't he?
He’s the one who gave me this.

253
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,400
You know, Hagrid. I know you know.

254
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,699
First, and ​understand this Harry
for its importance:

255
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,499
Not all witches are good.

256
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,199
Some of them don’t go well.
A few years ago...

257
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,399
…there was a terrible witch
as far as it can go. His name was V...

258
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,199
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

259
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,299
No, I can’t say.

260
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,800
"Good morning, Voldemort."
- Voldemort?

261
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,100
They were dark days, Harry. Dark days.

262
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,499
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

263
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,100
Take them into the darkness.

264
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,600
Everything that stood before
ended up dead.

265
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,699
Your parents fought with him.

266
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,800
But no one ever lived
he decided to kill them.

267
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,599
Nobody, nobody.

268
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,300
Just you.

269
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Me? Was Voldemort trying to kill me?

270
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,099
Whether. That’s not a round
in your face, Harry.

271
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,999
Such a brand only comes from
he mutters a curse, and ​a wicked curse at that.

272
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
What happened to V…?
For You-Know-Who?

273
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,399
Well, some say he’s dead.

274
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,999
Codswallop, in my opinion.

275
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,499
No, I think he's still alive...

276
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,599
...too tired to continue.

277
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,299
But one thing is for sure. Something
that you played last night.

278
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,800
That's why you're so great.
That's why everyone knows your name.

279
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You are the boy.

280
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What are you looking at?

281
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,699
Blimey, is it time?

282
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,899
Sorry, Harry, I have to leave you.
Dumbledore kissed the...

283
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,999
Well, he’ll want to see me.
Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.

284
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,600
Here’s your ticket. Stop by, Harry
which is very important. Stay on your ticket.

285
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,699
Platform 9 3/4?

286
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,699
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
I say platform 9 3/4.

287
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,300
There’s no such thing, right?

288
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm sorry.

289
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,599
Excuse me. Excuse me.

290
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,399
On your right ma’am.

291
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,399
Excuse me sir, can you tell me where
Can I find platform 9 3/4?

292
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,099
9 3/4? You think you’re funny, don’t you?

293
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,800
It’s the same every year,
full of Muggles, Yes. Come on!

294
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,600
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

295
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,400
Well, Percy, you first.

296
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,499
Fred, you next.

297
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,499
- No, Fred, that's it.
- Actually, ma'am, do you call yourself our mother?

298
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,700
Oh, I’m sorry, George.

299
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm just kidding. I’m Fred.

300
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,600
Excuse me.

301
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,399
Can you tell me how…?

302
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,199
How do you access the platform?
Don’t worry, my friend.

303
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,899
This is Ron's first time
also at Hogwarts.

304
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,999
All you have to do is walk straight over the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

305
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,800
- It's best to do it in short bursts if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

306
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,499
Excuse me. Are you worried?
All other places are full.

307
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,000
Not at all.

308
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,499
I’m Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

309
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,400
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

310
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,699
So it's true!

311
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,800
I mean, do you really have that…?

312
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,300
- What?
- The middle?

313
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,700
Evil!

314
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,300
- What about the cart, friends?
- No, thank you. I'm all set.

315
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,600
We’ll take the draw.

316
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,200
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- That means all food.

317
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,899
There’s chocolate
and mint and there’s also…

318
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,899
… spinach, liver and tripe.

319
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,400
George swore he got
a flavored one bogey once!

320
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,779
This is not true
frogs, right?

321
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,299
It's just a story. Also,
It’s the cards you want.

322
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:50,100
Each package includes a famous wizard
or witchcraft. I have about 500 myself.

323
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,900
Look!

324
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,800
Oh, that terrible luck. They just have
he had a good run at them to begin with.

325
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,400
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

326
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,699
Hey, he's dead!

327
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,400
Well, you can’t expect to
stay the whole day, okay?

328
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,099
This is Scabbers, by the way.
Sad, isn’t it?

329
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,499
Just a little bit.

330
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,999
Fred gave me a line like
to make it black. Would you like to see it?

331
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,400
Whether.

332
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,700
Has anyone seen a bird?

333
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,800
- A boy named Neville lost one.
- No.

334
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,700
Do you do magic?
Let’s see, then.

335
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,999
Sunshine, daisies, sweet butter.

336
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,400
Make this fat cat black.

337
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,699
Are you sure it’s a true statement?
Well, not so good, is it?

338
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,199
Yeah, I just tried
some easy ones myself…

339
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,100
…but everyone has been supportive.

340
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,800
For example:

341
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Oculus Reparo.

342
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,600
That’s better, right?

343
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,699
Holy cricket, you’re Harry Potter!

344
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,500
This is Hermione Granger.
And you...?

345
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,399
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

346
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,800
You guys better change into clothes.
I hope we get there soon.

347
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,299
You have dirt in your eyes, by the way.
Did you know?

348
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,500
Just there.

349
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,599
Yeah, then.
First year, this way, please!

350
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:07,100
Come on, now, first year, don’t be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

351
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,000
- It's okay, Harry.
- Look, Hagrid.

352
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,500
Yeah, then. This is the route for the ships.
Come, now, follow me.

353
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,000
Evil.

354
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,299
Welcome to Hogwarts.

355
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,499
Now, in a few days, you will experience
these doors and connect with your students.

356
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:49,699
But before you can sit down,
you must be elected in your homes.

357
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,099
They’re Gryffindor, Hufflepuff…

358
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,800
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

359
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,300
Now, while you’re here, your home
it will be like your family.

360
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,299
Success gives you points.

361
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,699
Anything that breaks the law,
and you will lose points.

362
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:17,299
By the end of the year, the building
with the most points getting the house cup.

363
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,800
Trevor!

364
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,299
I'm sorry.

365
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,600
The Feast of the Chosen
will start immediately.

366
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,200
Right then,
what they say on the train.

367
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,199
Harry Potter had come to Hogwarts.

368
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,900
Harry Potter?

369
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,099
This is Crabbe, and ​Goyle.

370
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,699
And I'm Malfoy.

371
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,400
Draco Malfoy.

372
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,799
You think my name is cool, don’t you?
I don’t need to ask about you.

373
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,900
Red hair and a flowing dress?
You must be a Weasley.

374
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,799
Let’s get to know some witch families soon
Better than most, Potter.

375
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,799
You don’t want to go looking for friends
for the wrong reasons.

376
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,300
I can help you there.

377
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,300
I think I can say the wrong
for me, thank you.

378
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,200
We are here for you now.
Follow me.

379
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,200
Not really, the wall. Just kidding
to look like the night sky.

380
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,500
I read about the
in Hogwarts: A Story .

381
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,600
“Okay, will you wait here, please?”

382
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,699
Now, before we get started…

383
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,099
…Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

384
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:23,200
I have some tips to get the process started
Meant.

385
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,699
The first year, see...

386
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:31,999
... that the darkness is
it is highly inappropriate for all students.

387
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,699
Also, our supervisor, Mr. Filch,
asked me to remind you...

388
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,599
... from the third floor hallway in the
right hand can't block...

389
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,200
…for everyone who doesn’t want
to die a painful death.

390
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,500
Thank you.

391
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,199
When I call your name,
was maybe.

392
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,099
Wearing the Sweepstakes Hat
in your head...

393
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,499
…and you will be selected
in your homes.

394
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,400
Hermione Granger.

395
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,300
No. Okay, calm down.

396
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,000
Mentally, that one, I tell you.

397
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,299
Ah, at the time… hmm… at the time.

398
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,200
Good. Gryffindor!

399
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,800
Draco Malfoy.

400
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,600
Slytherin!

401
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,299
No witch or wizard has ever gone bad
outside of Slytherin.

402
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,200
Susan Bones.

403
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,799
Harry, what is it?

404
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,799
Nothing. It's okay, I'm fine.

405
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,399
Let’s see…

406
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,100
I know! Hufflepuff!

407
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,200
Ronald Weasley.

408
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,100
Another Weasley!
I know what to do with you.

409
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,100
Gryffindor!

410
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,800
Harry Potter.

411
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,799
Hmm… difficult, very difficult.

412
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,899
A lot of energy, I see.
Not a bad idea, either.

413
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,499
There’s talent, oh, yeah.

414
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,499
And a desire to prove yourself.

415
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,000
But where do I put you?

416
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,999
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

417
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,899
Not Slytherin, right? Do you really know?

418
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,899
You could be so much better, you know.
It’s all here, in your head.

419
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,599
And Slytherin will help you along the way
honorably, there’s no doubt about that.

420
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,499
No? Well, if you really know.

421
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,399
You better be...

422
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,700
...Gryffindor!

423
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,000
Listen, please.

424
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,700
Let the party begin.

425
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,099
I am half and half.

426
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,599
My father is a Muggle. My mother is a witch.

427
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,400
A little awkward for him
when he knew.

428
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,199
Say, Percy, who's the master
talking to Professor Quirrell?

429
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,499
Oh, that’s Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

430
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,699
- What does he teach?
- Potions.

431
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:03,600
But everyone knows, it’s the Dark Arts that he likes.
He's been researching Quirrell's work for years.

432
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,399
Hello! How are you?

433
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,000
Welcome to Gryffindor.

434
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,600
Look, it’s the Blood Baron!

435
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,999
Good morning, Sir Nicholas.
Are you having a good time?

436
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,700
Sad. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been cancelled.

437
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,599
I know you.
You are almost brainless Nick.

438
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,499
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if it doesn’t bother you.

439
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,300
"Yes" without a head?
How can you be close to nothing?

440
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,600
Like this.

441
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,399
Gryffindors, follow me.
Keep it up. Thank you.

442
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,999
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

443
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,299
This is the most direct way
in the bedroom.

444
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,000
Oh, and ​check out the stairs.
They like change.

445
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,799
Go ahead, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

446
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,699
The picture is moving.

447
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,500
- Look at that one.
- I think he likes you.

448
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,499
- Look! Look!
- Who is that girl?

449
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,400
Welcome to Hogwarts.

450
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,000
Password?

451
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,200
Caput Draconis.

452
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,800
Follow me, all of you. Keep it up.
Quick, come on.

453
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,000
Gather here.

454
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,899
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

455
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,499
The boys’ bedroom is above and below to your left.
Ladies, same on the right.

456
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,900
You will see that yours has
have grown up.

457
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,699
I did it!

458
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,400
Can you imagine what it looks like in the past
McGonagall's face if you were late?

459
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,499
- That was so beautiful!
- Thanks for the suggestion, Mr Weasley.

460
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,974
Perhaps, it will be useful
if I changed

461
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,999
Mr. Potter and you
in a pocket-watch.

462
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,399
- Hopefully, one of you can make it in time.
- We got lost.

463
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,500
Then maybe a map? I believe in you
you don’t need one to find your seat.

464
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,299
There will be no stick-wielding foolishness
or information that is not relevant to this study.

465
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,099
As such, I don’t think
many of you will appreciate...

466
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,099
…the abstract science and exact art
which is potion-making.

467
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,400
However, for a select few…

468
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,700
...those who have the idea...

469
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,499
…I can teach you
how to stimulate the mind…

470
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,699
…and block the senses.

471
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,499
I can tell you how to scream respect...

472
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:04,700
…build respect and even
impose a penalty on death.

473
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,499
Unfortunately, some of you may have
come to Hogwarts in...

474
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:19,699
…has terrible supernatural powers that
you feel confident...

475
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,900
...to ignore.

476
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,500
Mr. Potter.

477
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,500
Our new knowledge.

478
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,500
Please tell me, what will I get if I add stripes
of asphodel with a rosemary infusion?

479
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,099
Don't you know? Well, let’s try again.

480
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:55,000
Where, Mr Potter, would you like to look
if I asked you to find me a bezoar?

481
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,699
I don't know, sir.

482
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,800
And what kind of
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

483
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,600
I don't know, sir.

484
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,000
Pity.

485
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,900
Of course, respect isn’t everything…

486
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,499
...is that so, Mr. Potter?

487
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:22,700
Of course, Hermione knows.
It seems a mercy not to ask.

488
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,000
Silence.

489
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,100
Put your hands down,
you stupid girl!

490
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,999
For reference, Potter…

491
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,669
…asphodel and wormwood
make a sleeping pill

492
00:55:47,695 --> 00:55:50,599
strongly identified as the
Draft of the living dead.

493
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:56,199
A bezoar is a stone that is removed from the intestine
a goat and will save you from most poisons.

494
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:03,100
Like monkshood and wolfsbane, similar
plant, which is also known as aconite.

495
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,900
Good...

496
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:12,300
…why don’t you all
Are you copying this?

497
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,599
And Gryffindors…

498
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,099
...see five points
be thrown out of your house...

499
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,700
…to your teacher’s face.

500
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Child's eyes, harp strings playing
Replace this water with rum.

501
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,500
A child’s eyes…

502
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,499
What Seamus wants to do
with the glass of water?

503
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,500
Replace with rum. He really did
a weak drink yesterday, before...

504
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,100
The form is here .

505
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,400
Can I recommend this? Thank you.

506
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,399
Look! Neville has a Remembrall.

507
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,200
I’ve read about it. When the smoke returns
red, it means you forgot something.

508
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,899
Only problem is, I don’t remember
that I have forgotten.

509
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,599
Hi Ron! Someone walks into Gringotts.
Listen.

510
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,499
"He believed it was the job
of Dark wizards or witches unknown...

511
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:16,399
…Gringotts goblins when they recognize
the division, they say, produced nothing.

512
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,299
The penalty in question, No. 713, contained, of course,
he was released earlier in the day."

513
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,900
That’s not true. That’s the catch
Hagrid and I left.

514
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,499
- Good afternoon, students.
- Good evening, Mrs. Hooch.

515
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,600
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

516
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,199
Welcome to your first driving lesson.

517
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,399
Well, what are you waiting for? All men
to the right of their gun.

518
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,199
Come on now, hurry up. Place your right hand
on the broom and say, "Up."

519
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,399
Up!

520
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,600
Up.

521
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,900
Up.

522
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,199
Up. Up!

523
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,500
Through our feelings.

524
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,199
Shut up, Harry.

525
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,999
Now, once you have
your broom, I want you to put it on.

526
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,300
And shut it tight, you don’t want to be
running from the end.

527
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,599
As I sing, I want each and every one of you
to shake it off the ground, hard.

528
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,599
Get up with your broom,
hold on a minute...

529
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,199
…then step forward a little
and play it again.

530
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,600
In my music. Three, two…

531
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,400
Mr. Longbottom.

532
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,799
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Search, search!

533
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,400
Neville!

534
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,800
Back to the present!

535
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,100
Everyone get out!

536
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,899
Is it okay?

537
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:49,900
Oh, honey, it’s a broken finger.
Poor boy. Come now, go up to get it.

538
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:55,799
Everyone needs to keep their feet on the ground
as I took Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.

539
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,599
Understand? If I see
a broom in the air…

540
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:05,099
...the rider will be found
of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.

541
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,199
Did you see his face?

542
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,299
Maybe if the softer side gave this one a twist,
he would remember falling on his butt.

543
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,100
Give it here, Malfoy.

544
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,600
No. I think I'll leave it somewhere
for the Longbottom experiment.

545
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,300
How about on the wall?

546
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,300
"What's going on, Potter?"
What is far from you?

547
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,499
Harry, no!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

548
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,699
Also, you don't know how to play.

549
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,900
What a fool.

550
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,799
Give it here or I will
Get off your broom!

551
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,200
Depend?

552
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,600
Do as you please, then.

553
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,899
- You're welcome, Harry.
- That was terrible, Harry!

554
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,200
Harry Potter!

555
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,200
Follow me.

556
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,100
You wait here.

557
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:59,099
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Can I borrow some wood?

558
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,200
Oh, yes, of course.

559
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:12,600
Potter, by Oliver Wood.
Wood, I found you a researcher.

560
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,199
Have you heard of it? Harry Potter
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

561
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,700
I always knew he would do well.

562
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:25,099
Researcher? But first year
rarely do home teams.

563
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:29,799
- You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
- A century, according to McGonagall.

564
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,599
Good luck, Harry.
Wood just told us.

565
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,399
Fred and George are also on the team.
Warriors.

566
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,299
Our job is to see if you
don’t get too comfortable.

567
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,199
I can’t make any judgments, of course.
Bad game, Quidditch.

568
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,299
It’s terrible, but no one has died in years.
Someone will disappear sometimes.

569
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,299
But they will show up in a month or two.

570
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:55,199
Oh, go Harry. Quidditch is awesome. Best game
there is, and you will be great too.

571
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,700
But I’ve never watched Quidditch.
What if I make a fool of myself?

572
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,900
You will not become a fool.
It's in your blood.

573
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:16,300
Harry, you never told me your father
he was an explorer as well.

574
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,300
I didn’t know.

575
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:28,299
I'm telling you, it's scary.
He knows more about you than you do.

576
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,900
Who doesn’t?

577
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,899
What has happened?

578
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,400
The stairs are interchangeable, remember?

579
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:48,300
- Let's go this way.
- Before the ladder moves again.

580
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,299
Does anyone feel
shouldn’t we be here?

581
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,599
We don't have to be here.

582
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,900
This is the third floor.
I can't.

583
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,600
Let's go.

584
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,700
- It's Filch's dog!
- Run!

585
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,800
"Quick, let's hide in the door!"

586
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,899
- It's closed!
- That's it, we're done!

587
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,400
Oh, stop!

588
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,500
Alohomora.

589
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,300
Enter.

590
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,499
Alohomora?

591
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,299
The book of words,
chapter seven.

592
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,900
Who here, my dear?

593
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,200
Come on.

594
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,499
- Filch is dead.
- He probably thinks this door is locked.

595
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,400
- It was closed.
- And for good reason.

596
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:30,499
What do they think they're doing? You will have something
like being trapped in a school.

597
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,399
You don’t use your eyes, do you? Didn’t you see
what did he stand on?

598
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,699
I couldn’t see his feet!
I was a little worried about his head.

599
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,799
Or maybe you didn’t know.
There were three!

600
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,699
He was standing in a locked door.
Which means it wasn’t there for nothing.

601
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:49,500
- He's looking at something.
- Are you saving something?

602
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,599
That's true. Now, if you guys don’t mind,
I don’t sleep…

603
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,499
…before you both think
another plot to kill us.

604
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,900
Or worse, fired.

605
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,400
It needs to address priorities.

606
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,199
Quidditch is pretty easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

607
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
a guardian and a scout. That’s you.

608
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,299
There are three types of balls.
This is called the Quaffle.

609
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:38,499
Now, the Chasers are refining the Quaffle and testing
to attach to one of the three hoops.

610
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,999
The Shepherd, that is me,
protects the hoops. With me so far?

611
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,800
That’s what I think. What is that?

612
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,300
You better get this.

613
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,100
Watch out now, he'll be back.

614
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,300
It's okay, Potter.
You would make a decent Beater.

615
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,300
What was that?

616
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,699
Bludger. The little bad guys.

617
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,500
But you are a researcher.

618
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,599
All I want is for you
what to worry about is this.

619
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,299
The Golden Snitch.

620
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,599
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

621
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,799
Just wait. It's really bad
and very nearly invisible.

622
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,899
What do I do with it?

623
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,399
You grab it.
Before the other Seeker team.

624
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,099
You see this, the game is over.

625
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:13,300
You know this, Potter,
and we win.

626
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:27,599
One of a more rudimentary wizard
knowledge is levitation…

627
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,799
…or the ability to make things fly.

628
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,499
Do you have hair? Good.

629
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,799
Now, don’t forget the cute doll
every day that we’ve been doing.

630
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,500
The swish and flick. All.

631
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:49,700
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and ​say it.

632
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,700
Wingardium Leviosa.
Go ahead, then.

633
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,199
Wingardium Leviosa.

634
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,800
Wingardium Leviosa.

635
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,799
No, stop, stop, stop! you’re going to
to gouge out someone’s eyes.

636
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:15,100
Again, you're wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

637
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,900
You will eventually, if you’re smart enough.
Go, go.

638
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,200
Wingardium Leviosa.

639
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:37,299
Well done! See here, all,
Miss Granger has done it!

640
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,200
Splendid!

641
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,000
Well done, my dear.

642
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,300
I think you’ll need
Another little nugget here, Master.

643
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,999
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

644
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,700
He’s a dream, really!
No wonder he has no friends.

645
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,900
I think he heard you.

646
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,599
Where is Hermione?

647
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,899
Parvati Patil said no
leave the girl's room.

648
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,300
He said he was there
all afternoon, she cried.

649
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,299
Troll! In the dungeon!

650
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,900
Troll in the dungeon!

651
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,100
I thought you should know.

652
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,800
Silence!

653
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,400
Everyone will not be afraid!

654
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,599
Now...

655
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:28,400
…prefects run their homes
back to the dorms.

656
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,900
Teachers follow us
in the prison.

657
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:48,099
Gryffindors, hurry up, please,
and stay awake.

658
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,999
How could a troll get in?

659
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,399
Not alone. Trolls are really stupid.
Maybe people are clapping.

660
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,700
- What is?
- Hermione! He doesn’t know.

661
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,100
I think the troll is out of jail.

662
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,100
He goes to the girl's room.

663
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,500
"Hermione, stop!"

664
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,000
Support! Support!

665
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,100
Hey, pea brain!

666
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,400
Support!

667
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,900
Do something!

668
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,300
- What is?
- Nothing!

669
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,299
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

670
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,900
Wingardium Leviosa.

671
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,800
Cool.

672
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,999
Is he dead?

673
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,200
I don’t think so. They just threw it out.

674
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,800
Troll bogies.

675
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,799
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, you guys!

676
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:58,700
- Well, what is...
- My fault, Professor McGonagall.

677
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,100
Miss Granger?

678
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,899
I went looking for the troll.
I had read about them and thought I could handle it.

679
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,999
But I was wrong.

680
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,400
If Harry and Ron hadn’t come
and found me, I might have been dead.

681
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:20,699
However, it was
a very stupid thing to do.

682
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:26,599
I would have expected more detail in your
I am half and so sorry for you, Mrs. Granger.

683
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,799
They will take five points
of Gryffindor…

684
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,700
...because you're so wrong.

685
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,999
As for the two men...

686
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,699
…I just want you to know
you are so happy.

687
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,299
Not many first-year students
could eat a full grown troll in the wild...

688
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,199
…and you’ll live to tell the tale.

689
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,900
Five points…

690
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,400
...will be given to each of you...

691
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:58,100
...for a stroke of luck.

692
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,400
Maybe you should go.
He might wake up.

693
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,100
- Good on you for getting me out of trouble like that.
- Remember, we saved his life.

694
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,899
Mind you, he probably didn’t need to defend
if you didn’t embarrass him.

695
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:29,500
What does it mean for friends?

696
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,299
Have some cake, my friend. Go away.

697
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,699
Ron is right, Harry.
Your strength will be needed today.

698
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,200
I'm not hungry.

699
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:46,299
Good luck now, Potter. Then again, now
that you are exposing yourself to a troll.

700
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,699
A little game of Quidditch
It should be an easy task for you.

701
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,100
Even if it's in front of Slytherin.

702
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,200
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

703
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:08,699
Listen, last night, I think Snape left
the troll as a challenge...

704
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,499
…that he could try and get past the three-headed dog.

705
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,499
But, he played it himself,
that's why he's confused.

706
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,100
But why would anyone approach the dog?

707
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,899
During my time at Gringotts, Hagrid took
something that comes out of one of the cages.

708
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:24,299
She said it was a Hogwarts project,
very secretive.

709
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,699
So you say...

710
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:30,500
That's how he takes care of the dog.
That's what Snape wants.

711
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:47,600
- A bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get letters.

712
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,700
Let’s open it up.

713
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,100
It’s a broom.

714
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,000
Not just a broom, Harry,
it’s a Nimbus 2000!

715
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,500
But who...?

716
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,599
"Are you scared, Harry?"
- Kinda.

717
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,499
That's all good. I felt the same way
before the first game.

718
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:41,299
- What happened?
- Er, I don't really remember.

719
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:44,099
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

720
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,300
I woke up in the hospital a week later.

721
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,699
Hello! Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the day.

722
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:17,800
In today’s game,
Slytherin and Gryffindor!

723
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,399
The players take their place
like Mrs. Hooch...

724
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,399
...comes out of
the place to start the game!

725
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,000
Now, I want a good, clean game...

726
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,100
...from all of you!

727
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,099
The Bludgers are up,
then the Golden Snitch.

728
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,999
Remember, the Snitch
worth 150 points.

729
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,100
The detective who caught the thief
game over.

730
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:26,300
The Quaffle Released
and the game begins!

731
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:49,800
Angelina Johnson wins!
Ten points to Gryffindor!

732
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,300
Well done!

733
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,400
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley reports to Captain Marcus Flint.

734
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,200
Another 10 points for Gryffindor!

735
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,900
Give me that!

736
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Take the sides!

737
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,700
Occurred
with Harry's broom?

738
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,699
It's Snape.
He’s shaking the broom!

739
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:39,400
- Are you kicking the broom? What are we doing?
- Let me.

740
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,700
"Come on, Hermione!"

741
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,600
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

742
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,700
Fire! You’re on fire!

743
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,700
Go, go, go, go!

744
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,100
It looks like it's going to get sick.

745
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,499
He’s got the Snitch!

746
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,799
Harry Potter gets 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

747
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,800
Gryffindor wins!

748
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:41,499
It doesn’t matter! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

749
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:45,699
Who knows? Why was he tryin
to get past the Three-Tailed Cat on Halloween?

750
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,299
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

751
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:52,199
- Does the object have a name?
- Yes it has a name. He's mine.

752
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,795
I bought it from a lrish feller
I met in the pub last year.

753
01:27:54,796 --> 01:27:56,651
Then I ordered
Dumbledore to take care of the...

754
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:57,352
Whether?

755
01:27:57,425 --> 01:27:59,375
I shouldn’t have said that.
No more questions!

756
01:27:59,376 --> 01:28:02,625
Don't ask any more questions.
It’s top secret, that’s all.

757
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,899
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy is cooking,
Snape tries to steal it.

758
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:10,800
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts headmaster.

759
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:16,299
Hogwarts student or not, I know a word when
I see one. I’ve read all about them.

760
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:20,099
You have to keep your eyes open,
and Snape didn't blink.

761
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,700
Exactly.

762
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,999
Now, listen to me.
all three.

763
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,899
You get involved in things that should
let’s not get involved. It’s very dangerous.

764
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:36,199
What the dog is cooking is very
between Prof. Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

765
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,900
Nicholas Flamel?

766
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:43,499
I shouldn't have said that.
I shouldn’t have said that.

767
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,799
Nicholas Flamel.
Who is Nicholas Flamel?

768
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,100
I do not know.

769
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,699
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

770
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,699
Ring the Hogwarts bell.

771
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,699
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

772
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:21,000
Cast a Christmas spell.

773
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,900
Knight to e5.

774
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,800
Queen for e5.

775
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,800
That's too bad!

776
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:58,899
It’s wizard chess.
I see you've picked it up.

777
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,600
I see you haven't.

778
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:06,099
Change of mindset. My parents decided to go
to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie.

779
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:10,099
- He's learning dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry, then.

780
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,699
He’s going to look it up in books
to learn about Nicholas Flamel.

781
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:17,500
We’ve tried a hundred times!

782
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:23,400
Not in the closing section.
Merry Christmas.

783
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:28,500
I think we have
a bad influence on him.

784
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:35,400
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

785
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:48,499
- Merry Christmas, Harry.
- Merry Christmas, Ron.

786
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,000
What are you wearing?

787
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,300
Oh, my mom made it.
It sounds like you have one too.

788
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,800
- Do I have gifts?
- Whether.

789
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,300
There they are.

790
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:22,799
"Your father left this
that I had before he died.

791
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,200
It’s time to get you back.
Use it wisely."

792
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:47,699
- What's that?
- Some kind of clothing.

793
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:51,000
Well, let’s see, then. Install it.

794
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,599
My body is exhausted !

795
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,500
I know what that is.
That’s an invisibility cloak!

796
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,900
Isn’t this obvious?

797
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:08,800
There really aren’t many.
I wonder who gave it to you.

798
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,100
There was no name.
He just said, "Use it wisely."

799
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:47,899
Fire food is very popular.
Fiends of the nineteenth century.

800
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:54,100
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

801
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,800
Who's there?

802
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:26,600
I know you're there.
You can't hide.

803
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,700
Who is he? Show up.

804
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,200
Severe, no...

805
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:30,699
You don’t want me
like your nemesis, Quirrell.

806
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:35,700
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know exactly what I mean.

807
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,099
We’ll talk soon.

808
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:01,799
Once you’ve had time to think
where your loyalty lies.

809
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,500
Teachers. I found this
in the range of confinement.

810
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:12,100
Still hot. It means
there is a student who gets out of bed.

811
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,000
Mom?

812
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:51,200
Dad?

813
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:31,000
Ron, you really need to see this!
Ron, you need to see this!

814
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:35,599
Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!

815
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,380
Why?

816
01:37:36,406 --> 01:37:39,525
There’s something you need to see.
Now, come on!

817
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:50,500
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

818
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,899
Just look at me.

819
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:57,399
Look carefully.
Go ahead, stand there.

820
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:03,600
- There. You see them, don’t you?
- That's me! I’m the only leader.

821
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,399
And I’ve got the Quidditch Cup.

822
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,900
And a lot of blood!
I’m also the Quidditch captain!

823
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:14,500
The quality is obvious.

824
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,799
Harry, do you think this mirror
does it show the future?

825
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:24,100
How can you?
Both my parents are deceased.

826
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:40,000
Do you like yours, Ron?

827
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,900
- Ron?
- I'll be back.

828
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:00,999
- Do you like to play chess?
- No.

829
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,699
- Do you want to go visit Hagrid?
- No.

830
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:09,499
Harry, I know what you’re thinking,
but no.

831
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,700
Something is wrong
of the glass.

832
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,400
Will you be back again, Harry?

833
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,899
I see that for you,
like many before...

834
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:52,399
…I found the recipe
from the Mirror of Erised.

835
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:56,900
I hope now
You know what he’s doing.

836
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,700
Let me give you an example.

837
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,299
The happiest man in the world...

838
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:06,899
…would look in the mirror
and see for himself...

839
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,399
... just like him.

840
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:14,699
So then, it shows us what we want.
What we want.

841
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,800
Whether. And no.

842
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:21,099
It doesn’t show us anything more or less…

843
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:27,299
…that the longest and most boring
what our heart desires.

844
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:32,299
Now you, Harry, what you have
never met your family...

845
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:36,299
…you see them standing next to you.

846
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,999
But remember this, Harry.

847
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:45,099
This mirror gives us
or knowledge...

848
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:47,500
…or the truth.

849
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:54,500
People are crazy about him.
Even goes crazy.

850
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:59,599
So tomorrow
will be moved to a new facility.

851
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,800
And I have to ask you…

852
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:06,700
…you won’t go looking for it again.

853
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:10,600
You don't have to focus on dreams, Harry...

854
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,000
…and forget about living.

855
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,300
Good luck, Hedwig.

856
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,899
Look at you, playing your cards.
Exciting!

857
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,199
We have final exams coming up.

858
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,999
I'm here. Please ask me any questions.

859
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,499
Well, out of three main
in a Forgetting Potion?

860
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,999
I forgot.

861
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,199
And what, may I ask, do you want to do
if I appear in the final exam?

862
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,499
- Copy.
- No, you won't.

863
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,444
Furthermore, according to the professor
McGonagall, we need to be

864
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:40,599
they give special pens
with an Anti-Trap Spell.

865
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:47,200
That's a curse! It’s like they
don't believe me! Dumbledore again!

866
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:54,900
- Leg-Locker Curse?
- Malfoy.

867
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:03,100
You need to start
standing in front of people, Neville.

868
01:43:03,200 --> 01 :43:06,799
How? I can’t stop!

869
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,100
I’ll do the damage!”

870
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:13,599
No, that’s all you need!
You’re going to warm my hot feet!

871
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:17,199
I don't appreciate it
the voice, Longbottom.

872
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,599
Also, if anyone wanted to see...

873
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:25,200
...my eyes have
completely grown up!

874
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,599
I found it!

875
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:35,999
"Dumbledore is famous for
victory over the dark Grindelwald in 1945."

876
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,680
Go away!

877
01:43:36,706 --> 01:43:39,399
"For the purpose of
twelve dragon's blood...

878
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,699
…and his role in alchemy with his
my friend, Nicholas Flamel”!

879
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:46,299
I knew the name like a familiar one.
I read it on the train the other day.

880
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,900
Follow me!

881
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,400
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

882
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:01,500
What about the competition?

883
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:08,599
I made you look in the wrong section.
How can I be so stupid?

884
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,899
I watched it a few weeks ago
for a quick reading.

885
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:14,200
Is this light?

886
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,099
Of course! Here it is!

887
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:25,399
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
the creator of the Philosopher’s Stone.

888
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,800
What?

889
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,399
Honestly, don’t you both read?

890
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:35,099
"The philosopher's stone is a myth
objects with surprising power.

891
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,899
Replaces all devices
in pure gold...

892
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:42,199
…and produces the Elixir of Life
that will make the drinker immortal."

893
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,499
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

894
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,900
I know what that means!

895
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:52,399
"The only cornerstone right now
owned by Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

896
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:57,900
…the famous alchemist from last year’s
celebrated his 665th birthday."

897
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:01,699
That’s what Fluffy is cooking on the 3rd floor.

898
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:06,700
That’s what’s under the hood.
The philosopher’s stone.

899
01:45:22,876 --> 01:45:23,576
Hagrid.

900
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,199
Oh, well, sorry, don’t mean to be mean,
but I’m not good enough to play at the moment.

901
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:30,200
We know about the Philosopher’s Stone.

902
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,642
We think Snape
he wants to steal.

903
01:45:36,668 --> 01:45:39,899
Snape? Blimey, didn’t you
you keep talking about him, right?

904
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:43,000
Hagrid, we know he’s looking for the stone.
We just don’t know why.

905
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:47,499
Snape is one of the students
protects the stone. He doesn't want to steal it.

906
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,799
What is?

907
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,399
You heard it. Right. Come, now,
I’m a little worried now.

908
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:55,299
Wait a minute.
"One of the students"?

909
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:59,399
Of course! There are other ways
we save the rock, right?

910
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,299
- Spells, enchantments.
- That's right.

911
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:05,499
Waste of time, if you ask me.

912
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,799
No one can get past Fluffy.

913
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,699
No idea how?
just me and Dumbledore.

914
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:15,600
I shouldn't have told you that.
I shouldn't have told you that.

915
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:34,499
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- What is? The...

916
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,699
I know what that is!

917
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:39,600
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

918
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:43,199
I won. A stranger
I found myself in the pub.

919
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:47,600
He seemed very happy to be released,
as a matter of fact.

920
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:12,000
Is that...

921
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,899
...a dragon?

922
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:18,499
That’s not just a dragon.
It’s a Norwegian Ridgeback.

923
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,599
Uncle Charlie works
with this in Romania.

924
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:26,800
Isn’t it beautiful? Oh, bless him!
See, he knows his mother.

925
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,199
Good luck, Norbert.

926
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:33,800
- Norbert?
- Yeah, well, it's got to have a name, right?

927
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:37,000
Not you, Norbert?

928
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:47,100
He needs to learn a little,
of course.

929
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:53,100
Who is that?

930
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,900
Malfoy.

931
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,000
Oh dear.

932
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:05,499
Hagrid had always wanted a dragon.
That’s what he told me when I first met him.

933
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:09,699
It’s really crazy.
And worst of all, Malfoy knows it.

934
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:14,099
- I don't understand. is it bad?
- It's not good.

935
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,600
Good night.

936
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:23,099
Nothing, I mean, nothing...

937
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:26,799
…gives a student the control
to walk to school at night.

938
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,899
So as a punishment for what you have done.
50 points will be taken.

939
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,500
- 50?!
- When.

940
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,799
And to make sure it doesn’t happen again…

941
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,400
…all four of you
will receive punishment.

942
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:45,299
Excuse me, Master,
maybe I misheard you.

943
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,799
I thought you said you were four.

944
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,499
No, you heard me right, Mr. Malfoy.

945
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:55,800
You see, it was a good thing you wanted to do,
you were also getting out of bed at the end of the hours.

946
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,200
Meeting with your classmates
in prison.

947
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:14,299
A tragedy left behind
the penalties of the past die.

948
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:19,299
There was a time when punishment would find you
hanging with your thumb on the lock.

949
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:22,400
God, I miss that call.

950
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:28,199
Keeping it locked
with Hagrid tonight.

951
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:33,800
He has a little job to do
in the midst of the Darkness.

952
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:38,800
So sad, this, Hagrid.

953
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,300
Oh, good God, man, you’re not there yet
about the blood dragon, eh?

954
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:49,600
Norbert left.

955
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:53,699
Dumbledore sent Romania
to live in a colony.

956
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:57,099
Well, that’s good, isn’t it?
He will be with his people.

957
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,699
Yes, but what if he doesn’t like Romania?

958
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:04,200
What if the other dragons are bad
for him? He’s just a kid, after all.

959
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:10,099
Oh, by God, calm down, man.
You’re going to the mountain, after all.

960
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,599
You have to have your own ideas about yourself.

961
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:18,600
The mountain? I thought that was ridiculous.
We can't go in there.

962
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:22,900
Students are not allowed to enter.
And there’s…

963
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,700
...wolves.

964
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:29,299
There’s more to it than just men
in the tree, boy.

965
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:32,300
You can count on that.

966
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,600
Night-night.

967
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:41,100
Right. Let's go.

968
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,599
Hagrid, what is that?

969
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:25,300
The reason we’re here.
Do you see that?

970
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:31,200
It’s unicorn blood, that’s what.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

971
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:36,300
Now, this one is very damaged
for a reason.

972
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:49,499
So, our task is to go
and look for the poor monster.

973
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:52,900
Ron, Hermione, you're coming with me.

974
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,600
And, Harry, you're going with Malfoy.

975
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,099
Good. Then I get Fang.

976
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:06,100
Good. Just so you know,
he is a very cowardly man.

977
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:14,699
Wait until my father hears about this.
This is the kind of employee.

978
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:18,799
If I didn’t know any better, Draco,
I would say you were nervous.

979
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:21,700
I'm not afraid, Potter.

980
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,800
Have you heard that?

981
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:28,699
Come on, Fang.

982
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,500
Scared!

983
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,600
What is it, Fang?

984
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:13,399
Harry Potter, you need to go.
Most of the animals here know you.

985
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:17,599
The mountain is not protected at this time.
Especially for you.

986
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:20,599
What was the thing that saved us?

987
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:26,099
A dangerous creature.
It is a great sin to kill a unicorn.

988
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:31,899
If you drink the blood of a unicorn, you will
you’re alive even if you’re an inch from death.

989
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:37,199
But at a terrible price. Your
we have killed something so pure...

990
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:42,199
…that when the blood took hold
your teeth, you will have a half-life.

991
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,199
A cursed life.

992
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:48,399
- But who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of anyone?

993
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:53,699
Do you mean the
who killed the unicorn...

994
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:57,799
...who drank his blood,
what was Voldemort?

995
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:03,300
Do you know the secret?
at the school today, Mr. Potter?

996
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,700
The philosopher’s stone.

997
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:09,000
Harry!

998
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:13,999
Good morning, Florence.
See you already know our young Mr. Potter.

999
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,500
Are you alright there, Harry?

1000
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:21,900
Harry Potter,
I'll leave you here.

1001
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:26,600
You're fine now. Good luck.

1002
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:38,299
You mean, You-Know-Who's Out There
now on the mountain?

1003
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:41,299
But he is weak.
She lives with the unicorns.

1004
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,399
Don't you see? We didn’t have it right.

1005
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:48,999
Snape doesn't want the stone for himself.
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

1006
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,699
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort would be strong again.

1007
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,499
He will come again.

1008
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,499
But if he comes back...

1009
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:01,800
…you don’t think he’ll try
to kill you, right?

1010
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:06,299
I think if he had the chance,
he probably wanted to kill me tonight.

1011
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:10,099
And I’ll think, I’m worried
of my Potions finish.

1012
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:13,999
Wait a minute.
We forget something.

1013
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,200
Who is a wizard
Was Voldemort always afraid?

1014
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:24,999
Dumbledore. When Dumbledore
it's close, Harry, you're safe.

1015
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,400
While Dumbledore is alive,
they can't catch you.

1016
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:40,399
I kept hearing about Hogwarts final year exams
They were scary, but I found that rewarding.

1017
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:44,299
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

1018
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:49,699
- My middle. It’s always burning.
- It's happened before.

1019
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:52,599
- Not like this.
- Maybe you should see the doctor.

1020
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:56,400
I think it’s a warning.
It means danger is coming.

1021
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:06,399
- Of course!
- What's that?

1022
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:10,299
Don’t you think it’s a little strange that
Hagrid wants more than anything to be a dragon…

1023
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:13,599
…and a stranger shows up from
you just happen to have one?

1024
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:16,499
That is, the number of people walking
with their dragon dogs in their pockets?

1025
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:19,100
Why didn’t I see it before?

1026
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:28,099
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon?
What did it look like?

1027
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:30,999
I don't know, I've never seen his face.
He kept his head up.

1028
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,900
The other person, however, you and he
He must be speaking.

1029
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,899
Well, he wanted to know what kind of
of the animals I cared for.

1030
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:42,099
I told him. I said, "Then Fluffy,
a dragon won’t have a problem.”

1031
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:46,900
- And he seemed to want Fluffy?
- Well, of course he wanted Fluffy.

1032
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,399
How often do you find a
three-headed dog, even if you’re in the market?

1033
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:57,299
But I told him. I said, “The trick with any animal
it’s about learning how to breathe.”

1034
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:03,000
Take Fluffy, for example. Just squeeze a little
music and he sleeps straight.

1035
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:07,299
I shouldn't have told you that.

1036
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,800
Where are you going? Wait!

1037
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:19,600
We need to see Professor Dumbledore.
Now!

1038
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:22,599
I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore isn't here.

1039
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:27,299
They adopted a special dog from the
Ministry of Magic and immediately left for London.

1040
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:30,099
Did he leave? Now?
But this is important!

1041
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:32,600
This is from the Philosopher’s Stone!

1042
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:38,200
- How do you know...?
- Someone will try to steal it.

1043
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:41,383
I don’t know how you three
showed that the rock,

1044
01:58:41,409 --> 01:58:43,999
but I tell you that
perfectly preserved.

1045
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,600
Now would you go back
in your room? Just peace.

1046
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:59,599
That wasn't a man Hagrid had met in the village.
Elijah Snape.

1047
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:02,499
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1048
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:06,600
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

1049
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:11,699
Now, what would three young
Gryffindors like you...

1050
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:16,300
…making it inside on a day like this?

1051
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:24,600
- We're just...
- You have to be careful.

1052
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:27,100
People will think you...

1053
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:34,100
… to a certain extent.

1054
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:46,299
Now what are we going to do?

1055
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,400
We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.

1056
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:05,599
Trevor.

1057
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:09,299
Trevor, shh! go! You shouldn't be here!

1058
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:14,899
You don’t have to either.
You're running away again, aren't you?

1059
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:19,099
- Now, Neville, listen. We are...
- No, I won't let you!

1060
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:23,899
Getting Gryffindor in trouble again.
I will fight you.

1061
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:28,600
Neville, I am so sorry about this.
Petrifico Totalus.

1062
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:40,299
Sometimes a little scary,
You know that?

1063
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:44,200
Nice, but scary.

1064
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,799
Let's go.

1065
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,400
- I'm sorry.
- For your own good, you know.

1066
02:00:56,500 --> 02:01:00,800
- Ow! You stood on my shoulder!
- I'm sorry.

1067
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:06,700
Alohomora.

1068
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:21,200
Wait a minute. He...

1069
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,600
… whispers.

1070
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:32,700
Snape is already here.
He has put a spell on the harp.

1071
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,300
It has a terrible air.

1072
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,899
- We need to replace his leg.
- What is?

1073
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,600
Come on!

1074
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:49,700
Good. Push.

1075
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:16,399
I'll go first. Don’t follow
until I give you a sign.

1076
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:21,700
If something bad happens,
get out.

1077
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:26,000
Do you find it a little quiet?

1078
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:28,500
The harp.

1079
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:31,900
He’s not playing anymore.

1080
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,000
Salt!

1081
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:00,800
Lucky this type of plant is here, really.

1082
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,299
Don’t move, both of you.
This is the light of the Devil.

1083
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:22,199
You need to calm down. If you don’t,
it will just kill you faster.

1084
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:27,500
Will it kill me faster?
Oh, I can relax now!

1085
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,100
Hermione!

1086
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:35,399
- Now what are we going to do?
- Just sit down!

1087
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:40,200
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I tell you! Trust me.

1088
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,499
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1089
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:53,799
- He doesn't sit down, does he?
- Apparently not.

1090
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:56,499
- We need to do something.
- What is?

1091
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:59,800
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1092
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:04,399
Devil's tower, Devil's tower.
It's so beautiful...

1093
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,999
…but so much in the sun!
That's it! Devil Snare hates the sun.

1094
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,400
Lumus Solem.

1095
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:22,000
- Ron, are you okay?
- Whether.

1096
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:27,200
Fortunately we weren’t shocked.

1097
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:31,400
Lucky Hermione listens
in Herbology.

1098
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,499
What is it?

1099
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:38,500
I do not know. It sounds like his wings.

1100
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:54,999
Curious. I’ve never seen
birds like this.

1101
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,899
They are not birds.
They are keys.

1102
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:02,600
And I’ll put one of them
enters the door.

1103
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:10,700
- What does all this mean?
- I do not know.

1104
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,600
Strange.

1105
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:21,300
Alohomora!

1106
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,499
Well, it was worth a try.

1107
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:29,899
What are we going to do?
There must be a thousand keys up there.

1108
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:34,099
Looking for a big old one.
It may be as dry as the handle.

1109
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:37,800
There! I see!
The one with the split tail.

1110
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:43,700
“What’s going on, Harry?”

1111
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,999
It’s very simple.

1112
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,899
Oh, come on, Harry! If Snape could catch
on the old broomstick, maybe.

1113
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:54,800
You are the youngest researcher
in a century.

1114
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:14,600
This affects him a little.

1115
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:37,800
Get the key out!

1116
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:44,200
Hurry up!

1117
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:21,199
I don’t like this.
I don’t like this.

1118
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:24,700
Where are we? A cemetery.

1119
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,700
This is not a cave.

1120
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:38,100
It’s a chess board.

1121
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:52,000
There's the door.

1122
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:05,600
Now what are we going to do?

1123
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:10,100
Obvious, right? We have
to run around the house.

1124
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:14,400
Alright. Harry, you’ll take
the empty bishop’s square.

1125
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:18,899
Hermione, you would be
the castle next to queen.

1126
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:23,300
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1127
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:32,200
What happens now?

1128
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:35,899
Good, clean first walk.

1129
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:38,000
And then...

1130
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:41,000
…we play.

1131
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:56,599
Ron, don’t you think
this will look like...

1132
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:00,499
...real chess magic, huh?

1133
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:03,800
It's there, d5.

1134
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:19,899
Yes, Hermione.

1135
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:25,300
I think this will be
just like wizard chess.

1136
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:33,700
Castle for e4!

1137
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,600
Pawn to c3!

1138
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,199
- Wait a minute.
- You got it right, Harry.

1139
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:33,200
Once I’ve done my homework,
the queen will take me.

1140
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:36,099
Then you will be free to see the king.

1141
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:39,100
- No. Ron, no!
- What's that?

1142
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:44,299
- He'll give up.
- No, I can't! There has to be another way!

1143
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:48,299
Do you want to stop Snape
that you will get the stone or not?

1144
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:52,200
Harry, you’re the one who needs to go.
I know.

1145
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:55,400
It is not. Not Hermione. You.

1146
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:08,600
Knight for h3.

1147
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:31,500
Check.

1148
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,399
Ron!

1149
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:08,500
No, don't move!
Don’t forget, we’re still playing.

1150
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:24,800
Dead.

1151
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:47,199
Take care Ron.
Then go to the bird sanctuary.

1152
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:51,299
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron is right.

1153
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:53,400
I have to go.

1154
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:59,799
You'll be fine, Harry.
You are a great magician. You’re real.

1155
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:02,600
Not as good as you.

1156
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:08,200
Me? Books and ideas.
There are important things.

1157
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:15,100
Love and strength.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1158
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:54,800
You?

1159
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:59,399
No, it can’t be.
Snape, he was the…

1160
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:02,599
Yes, he seems the thing,
isn't he?

1161
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:05,999
Beside him, who would have thought…

1162
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,099
...poor, talking
Professor Quirrell?

1163
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:15,699
But that day, in the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1164
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:18,800
No, my dear. I wanted to kill you!

1165
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,399
And trust me, if Snape’s suit didn’t catch
fire and lost my eye...

1166
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:25,799
…I would win.

1167
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:28,999
Even with Snape talking
his little punishment.

1168
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,399
Was Snape trying to save me?

1169
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:36,999
I knew you were a danger to me from the start.
Especially after Halloween.

1170
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:41,399
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very well, Potter, yes.

1171
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:44,700
Snape, unfortunately, was not fooled.

1172
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:50,300
While everyone else was running around in jail,
went to the third floor to get me out.

1173
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:54,700
He, of course, never believed me again.

1174
02:14:55,400 --> 02:15:00,899
He never left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1175
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:05,099
I’m never alone. Never.

1176
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:09,500
Now, what does this mirror do?

1177
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:13,200
I see what I want.

1178
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:18,099
I seem to have the rock.
But how do I get it?

1179
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:20,600
Use the boy.

1180
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:25,300
"Come here, Potter!" Now!

1181
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:41,400
Tell me, what do you think?

1182
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,899
What is that? What do you see?

1183
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:14,199
I've played with Dumbledore.
I have won the house cup.

1184
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,100
He's lying.

1185
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:20,199
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1186
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:24,799
- Let me talk to him.
- Master, you're not strong.

1187
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:29,100
I have the strength for this.

1188
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,099
Harry Potter…

1189
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:52,699
...we'll meet again.

1190
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:54,299
Voldemort.

1191
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:58,499
Whether. Do you see what I’ve done?

1192
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:02,299
Do you see what I must do to be saved?

1193
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:06,700
Live with someone else. Just a parasite.

1194
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:10,599
Unicorn blood can help me...

1195
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:14,499
...but he can't give me
a body of my own.

1196
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:18,299
But there is one possibility.

1197
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:24,200
Something that, naturally,
it’s in your pocket.

1198
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:26,200
Stop it!

1199
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:34,000
Don't be a fool.

1200
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:37,499
Why go through a gruesome death…

1201
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:41,299
…when can you join and be present?

1202
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:42,700
Never!

1203
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:49,500
Confidence. Your parents had too.

1204
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,499
Tell me, Harry…

1205
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:57,599
…you want to see
your mother and father again?

1206
02:17:57,600 --> 02:17:59,899
Together...

1207
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:02,800
…we can get them back.

1208
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:07,900
I'm just asking for a raise.

1209
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:17,700
That's it, Harry.

1210
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:22,399
There is no right and wrong.

1211
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:25,599
There is only energy...

1212
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:30,000
…and the weakest to track.

1213
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:35,800
Together, we will
things that are unusual.

1214
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:38,400
Just give me the rock!

1215
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:42,099
You're a liar!

1216
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:44,600
Kill him!

1217
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:13,400
- What is this magic?
- You fool, take the stone!

1218
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:01,200
Good evening, Harry.

1219
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,699
- Token fans?
- Admirers?

1220
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:13,899
What happened downstairs in the dungeon between
you and Professor Quirrell are a complete mystery.

1221
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:19,000
So, of course, the whole school knows.

1222
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:24,899
I think your friend Ronald
saved you the trouble...

1223
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:27,899
...that you open your Chocolate Frogs.

1224
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:31,199
Was Ron here? Is it okay?
What about Hermione?

1225
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:36,400
Good. Both are just fine.

1226
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:39,700
- What happened to the Stone?
- Calm down, my boy.

1227
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:42,899
The stone has been destroyed.

1228
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:46,899
My friend Nicholas and I
we’ve got some news…

1229
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:51,499
…and agreed it was the best of all.

1230
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:55,600
But then, Flamel,
die, right?

1231
02:21:57,300 --> 02:22:02,999
He has plenty of Elixir
to improve performance.

1232
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:06,499
But yes, he will die.

1233
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:09,099
How did I get the stone, sir?

1234
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:11,899
For a minute I looked
in the mirror and the other...

1235
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:16,299
You see, just one person...

1236
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:20,399
...who wanted to know the stone,
find out...

1237
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:25,300
...but don't use it,
could get it.

1238
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:29,699
That’s one of my best ideas.

1239
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:35,000
And between you and me,
which means something.

1240
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:41,599
Does that mean, with the stone gone, that is,
that Voldemort can never return?

1241
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:44,200
I'm afraid...

1242
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:49,700
…there are ways
in which it can be recovered.

1243
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:52,899
Harry, do you know why...

1244
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:57,099
...Professor Quirrell couldn't resist
to touch?

1245
02:22:57,100 --> 02:23:02,000
It was because of your mother.
He sacrificed himself for you.

1246
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:05,699
And the behavior leaves a mark.

1247
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:09,699
No, this type of mark cannot be seen.

1248
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:14,900
- It's on your skin.
- What's that?

1249
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:19,500
Love, Harry. Love.

1250
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:31,599
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1251
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:36,499
I used to be very depressed when I was a child
to find one with flavor.

1252
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:39,999
And to this day, I do.
I don’t like them anymore.

1253
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,599
But I think I could get away with it...

1254
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:46,300
…with a good toffee.

1255
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:51,900
Oh!

1256
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:54,700
Duck wax.

1257
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:13,100
- Are you okay, Ron?
- All right. You?

1258
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:17,000
All right. Hermione?

1259
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:19,500
It’s never been better.

1260
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,700
Another year has passed.

1261
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:42,899
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs a price.

1262
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:45,799
And the points are as follows:

1263
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:51,900
in fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1264
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:59,500
Third,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1265
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:06,499
In second place...

1266
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:11,600
…Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1267
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:18,999
And in the first place…

1268
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:24,800
…with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1269
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,600
Good one, my friend.

1270
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:40,199
Yeah, yeah, well done, Slytherin.
Well done, Slytherin.

1271
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:44,899
However, recent developments should
let it be seen.

1272
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:50,200
And I have some final
to pay.

1273
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:56,199
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the good works of the mind...

1274
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:59,300
…while others are in grave danger…

1275
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:02,300
…50 points.

1276
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:04,500
Good job.

1277
02:26:11,900 --> 02:26:18,200
Second, why did Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best chess game ever...

1278
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:24,000
…which Hogwarts sees
this many years, 50 points.

1279
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:30,700
And third…

1280
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:33,999
...for Mr. Harry Potter…

1281
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:38,600
…for clean nerves
and very strong...

1282
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:44,100
...l give Gryffindor House 60 points.

1283
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:54,199
We live with Slytherin!

1284
02:26:54,200 --> 02:27:00,399
After all, it takes a lot of energy
to stand with your enemies...

1285
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:04,499
…but so much
to stand up to your peers.

1286
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:07,699
This gives 10 points...

1287
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:11,200
...for Neville Longbottom.

1288
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:27,899
I think my measurements
right I believe...

1289
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:32,700
... of a change
products are under control.

1290
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:41,100
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1291
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:22,399
Come on, now.
Hurry up to get some rest.

1292
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:27,000
Train goes. Go away.
Come on, hurry up.

1293
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:35,700
"Come on, Harry."
- One minute.

1294
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:45,700
I thought you were going
you wouldn’t say goodbye, would you?

1295
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:50,800
This is for you.

1296
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:09,700
Thank you, Hagrid.

1297
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:19,900
Go away. Stay with you. Connect with yourself right now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1298
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:24,799
If the baby of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, giving you some trouble...

1299
02:29:24,800 --> 02:29:27,699
…you could always surprise him…

1300
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:30,699
…with a good ear
to go with the tail.

1301
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:36,100
But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. That you know.

1302
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:40,900
I do. But your cousin doesn’t, does he?

1303
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:49,499
I know it’s weird to go home,
right?

1304
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:51,699
I'm not going home.

1305
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:54,000
Not really.

1306
02:30:34,882 --> 02:30:40,879
Subtitles by Your Friend, awaqeded.


1
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,134
I can't let you leave, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,862
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:23,207
-Also, if Uncle Vernon--
-Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:26,672
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:34,180
He's there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:40,289
I recommend, if you can’t manage
the bloody bird, will have to go.

7
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,259
But he’s smiling.

8
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:46,923
if I could just let it out
an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,059
So you can send secret messages
with your best friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:56,368
But I don’t have any information
from one of my friends.

11
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:58,170
Nothing...

12
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,078
...all the time.

13
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:03,477
Who would want to be
your friends with you?

14
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:08,186
I should think you would be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:11,846
We raised you since you were a baby.
we gave you the food from our table...

16
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:14,152
...although it allows you
Dudley's second room...

17
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,852
…except for the good stuff
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:23,065
-Not now. will be available when the Masons arrive.
-Which should be any minute.

19
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:26,536
Now, let’s look at our schedule
once, maybe?

20
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:28,640
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
Was Elise…?

21
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:32,505
in the living room, waiting to receive me
with love in our home.

22
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:36,615
-Good. And, Dudley, you'll be...?
-n wait to open the door.

23
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,683
Excellent.

24
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:45,087
And you?

25
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:50,027
i'll be in my room, doing nothing
and I pretend I don’t exist.

26
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:51,925
Quite right, you will.

27
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:55,590
With any luck, this might be the time
doing the most important thing in my career...

28
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,296
…and you won’t break it.

29
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,285
Harry Potter, a great honor.

30
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,061
-Who are you?
-Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf.

31
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,161
Don’t be mean or anything…

32
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:29,290
…but this is not a good time for me
to keep a house-elf in my room.

33
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,960
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

34
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:35,232
it’s just Dobby
come to tell you….

35
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:40,243
very difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to start.

36
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:46,215
-Why don't you sit down?
-Sit down? Sit down?

37
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,983
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn’t want to
to hurt your feelings or whatever.

38
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,321
Do you hate Dobby?

39
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:58,828
Dobby heard
of pride, sir...

40
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:04,766
…but they never asked
to sit with a witch, as an equal.

41
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,333
You cannot meet
many good witches later.

42
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,908
No, I haven’t.

43
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:13,841
That was a horrible thing to say.

44
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,938
-No good Dobby! Damn Dobby!
-Stop, Dobby. Dobby, talk.

45
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:19,482
Dobby, stop.

46
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,618
Don't worry about it. just the dog.

47
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:33,089
-No good Dobby.
-Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please stop.

48
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:35,564
Are you okay?

49
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:39,169
Dobby needed to shut up, sir.

50
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:42,570
Dobby almost blurts out
of his family, sir.

51
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:46,678
-Your family?
-The wizard family Dobby is serving, sir.

52
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,838
Dobby has to serve
a family forever.

53
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:52,576
If they knew Dobby was here….

54
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,988
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to save Harry Potter. To remind you.

55
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,457
Harry Potter doesn’t need to return…

56
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:07,328
...at Hogwarts School
of witchcraft and sorcery this year.

57
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,665
There is a warning, a warning that you must
very bad things happen.

58
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,172
What the fuck?
Who organizes them?

59
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:19,511
I can’t say.

60
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:25,679
-Okay, I understand. You can't say.
-Don't make me talk. l--

61
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,385
-Dobby. Dobby, turn on the lights.
-No good Dobby.

62
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:34,617
So when they arrive
on the ninth hole….

63
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:39,790
Give me the light.

64
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,901
Dobby, stop!

65
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:49,064
-Let me go.
-Get in there and shut up.

66
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:53,303
-What are you doing wrong up here?
-l was just--

67
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,209
You just pressed the button
from my Japanese golfer joke.

68
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,215
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:03,847
Another word and you’ll want
you would never have been born, boy.

70
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:07,823
-And fix the door.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:11,723
Do you see why I have to go back?

72
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:15,664
not here here.
i live in your world, at Hogwarts.

73
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:20,465
- It's the only place I have friends.
-Friends who don’t read with Harry Potter?

74
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,541
Well, I think it is….

75
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,374
Wait. How do you know
my friends haven’t written to me?

76
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:31,909
Harry Potter shouldn’t
be angry with Dobby.

77
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:36,283
Dobby hoped that if Harry Potter
he thought his friends had forgotten him...

78
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:40,119
…Harry Potter probably won’t
to go back to school, sir.

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,727
-Give me that. Now.
-No!

80
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:01,343
Dobby, come back here.

81
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:07,816
Dobby, please, no.

82
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:12,185
Harry Potter has to say
he’s not going to school anymore.

83
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:14,959
would. Hogwarts is my home.

84
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:21,225
Then Dobby must, sir,
for Harry Potter quality.

85
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:26,395
spread as far as he could see,
all on the floor of this house.

86
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,540
One plumber said,
Look at all the water.

87
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,700
The second plumber said,
''Yes, and that's all that matters.''

88
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
Mr. Mason.

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,920
Vernon tells me
you are an amazing golfer.

90
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,880
l run sometimes.

91
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,320
Mrs. Mason.

92
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
Where are you looking
the beautiful dresses?

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,400
All my suits are custom made.

94
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,760
Dudley.

95
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,680
Wasn’t there something
did you mean?

96
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,440
-Pudding.
-Pudding? What pudding?

97
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,240
I am very sad. that’s my nephew.
He is very busy.

98
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,080
Meeting strangers makes him uncomfortable.
So I had it upstairs.

99
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,480
Well, we have ice cream.

100
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:47,444
You’re never going back to that school.

101
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:52,640
You will never see the
Bad friends again. Never!

102
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,922
Good luck, Harry.

103
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:45,469
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

104
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:49,539
I saved you, yes.
Now, come on, get your staff.

105
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:57,942
You better get up.

106
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:00,510
Let's go.

107
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:07,190
-What was that?
-What was it?

108
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:11,656
Potter!

109
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,491
“Dad, what’s going on?”

110
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:17,792
Go. Go. Go.

111
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:18,993
Dad, hurry up.

112
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,069
-Come on.
"Come on, Harry, stop."

113
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:26,840
Petunia, he's running away!

114
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,570
"I've got you, Harry."
-Come here!

115
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,846
-Leave me alone!
-No, boy!

116
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:36,009
You and the bloody dove
they’re not going anywhere.

117
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:37,814
-Get down!
-Drive!

118
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,854
-Right.
-Right!

119
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:41,685
No! No! No! No!

120
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:47,860
Dad!

121
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:58,498
Damn.

122
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:06,515
With that, Harry, good day.

123
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:34,641
Come on.

124
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,248
Well, come on.

125
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,314
Well, come on.

126
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:54,589
-Do you think it would be nice to have some?
-Of course, my mother will never know.

127
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:14,513
not much, but it’s home.

128
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:16,950
I think it’s great.

129
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:21,488
Where have you been?

130
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:24,919
Harry, very nice
to see you, my darling.

131
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:28,691
The bed is open. Nothing. Car drove off.

132
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:31,859
You could have died.
They could see you.

133
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:35,065
Of course, no
blame you, Harry, darling.

134
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,266
They were starving, my mother.
There were bars on his window.

135
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:43,210
Well, you better hope I don’t include bars
at your window, Ronald Weasley.

136
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,508
Come on, Harry,
time for a snack.

137
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:49,415
Here we go, Harry. Now, enter.

138
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:53,182
That's it. There we go.

139
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:57,185
-Mom, have you seen my jumper?
-Yes, honey, it was in the dog.

140
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:59,423
Hello.

141
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,133
What did I do?

142
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:09,899
Ginny. He’s talking about you
all the time. A little sad, really.

143
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:12,668
-Good morning, Weasleys.
-Good morning, Dad.

144
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:17,411
-What a night. Eight shots. Nine!
-¿Raids?

145
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:21,512
My father works for the Ministry of Magic,
in the Muggle Artifact Disuse Bureau.

146
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:25,014
My father loves Muggles,
he thinks they’re amazing.

147
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,419
Well, now.

148
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:30,555
And who are you?

149
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:34,890
Excuse me, sir. and this is Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

150
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,167
Good Lord. Is it really you?

151
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:43,070
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

152
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,731
This morning.

153
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:50,103
Your boys drove the coolest car
from yours in Surrey and will return last night.

154
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:53,717
Did you really do it? How did it happen?

155
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:58,720
I mean-- That was awful
of course, young people. Too bad of you.

156
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:03,926
Now, Harry, you should know
all about Muggles.

157
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:08,191
Tell me, what exactly
is it the work of a rubber duck?

158
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,500
Well, that would be Errol by the way.

159
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:24,043
Take it, will you, Percy, please?

160
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:27,613
-Errol.
-He always does that.

161
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:33,212
See, it's our Hogwarts letter.
We have also been sent about Harry.

162
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:36,451
Dumbledore needs to know you're here.
He doesn’t miss a beat, man.

163
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,562
-No.
-This lot doesn't come cheap.

164
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,064
-The grammar book alone is expensive.
-We will.

165
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:48,067
There’s only one place to go
accept all of this. Diagon Alley.

166
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:50,672
Right.

167
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:52,935
Here we go, Harry.
You go first, my friend.

168
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:56,103
But Harry never went
with Floo powder first, Mom.

169
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,304
Floo powder?

170
00:14:57,482 --> 00:15:01,748
You go first, Ron, because Harry
can see how it's done. Whether.

171
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:04,252
when you go.

172
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,312
That's it.

173
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,522
Diagon Alley.

174
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:21,060
Do you see? It’s so easy, my dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

175
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,035
Come on.

176
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,405
when you go. That's it. Think about it in your head.

177
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,979
That's true.
Now, grab your Floo powder.

178
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,984
That’s right, it’s great.

179
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:39,522
Now, don’t forget to comment
very, very good.

180
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:43,725
On the diagonal.

181
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,601
-What did he say, honey?
-Diagonal.

182
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,828
i thought he did.

183
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,010
Don't touch anything, Draco.

184
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,450
Yes, my Father.

185
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,610
Mr. Malfoy,
it’s great to see you again.

186
00:17:35,770 --> 00:1 7:38,930
And young Headmaster Malfoy too. Delighted.

187
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,210
I have to show you, just today,
and very good value--

188
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,690
-I'm not buying it now, Borgin. this is for sale.
-Are you selling?

189
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,450
Draco.

190
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,210
You know, nothing,
from the Ministry of Magic...

191
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,450
…making more attacks
in private homes.

192
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,770
There are also words
about a new muggle security system.

193
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,530
The blood of a pure wizard is of little value
somewhere, I’m afraid.

194
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,610
Not with me.

195
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,130
However, I brought some
of his house that may reveal...

196
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:17,450
...shame they were the Ministry to summon them.
Poisons and other things.

197
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,130
Look at this.

198
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,050
The item is not for sale.

199
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,330
l understand. it has distinct qualities.

200
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,690
One would not want to see
it will fall into the hands of the wicked.

201
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,610
You can keep the box.

202
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,050
What did I say?

203
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,850
-Don't touch anything.
-Exactly.

204
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,370
I'm sorry, Dad.

205
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,890
Come on. We're going.

206
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,650
a pleasure doing business with you,
Mr. Malfoy.

207
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,130
Always a pleasure.

208
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:38,181
-Looking for something?
-No, l...

209
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,061
it’s just in the wrong place.

210
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:42,021
I'm sorry.

211
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,221
Thank you.

212
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:06,064
-You're not lost, are you, honey?
-I'm fine, thank you. I was just going….

213
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:10,728
Come with us. We will help you
find your way back.

214
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:13,605
-No. Please--
-Harry?

215
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:14,833
Hagrid!

216
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,036
What do you think
what are you doing down here? Come on.

217
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:29,086
You're a mess, Harry. War
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

218
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:33,250
Don't want to go unnoticed there.
People will think you're not good enough.

219
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:35,658
l disappeared, l--

220
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:38,800
Wait. what were you
what are you doing down there then?

221
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:44,098
Me? i was.... watching
for the carnivore diet.

222
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,173
They’ve destroyed all the school cabbages.

223
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,231
Harry. Hagrid.

224
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,838
Good morning, Hermione.

225
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:59,869
-it's so good to see you.
-it's good to see you too.

226
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,105
What did you do with your glasses?

227
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,147
Oculus Reparo.

228
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,350
I really need to remember that one.

229
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:16,254
Will you be alright now, Harry?
Right. I’ll leave you with it.

230
00:21:16,427 --> 00:21:17,894
-Okay, stay.
-Thank you. Bye.

231
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:20,027
Come on, everyone is so busy.

232
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:31,866
Harry.

233
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,273
Thank you. We hoped
we just went one step too far.

234
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:38,279
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

235
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:40,713
Here he is.

236
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:46,349
My mother loves him.

237
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:49,788
Make a trip there, please.
Leave me alone, woman. Thank you.

238
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,396
I'm sorry, girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

239
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:00,468
it cannot be. Harry Potter?

240
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:03,871
Harry Potter!

241
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,235
I'm sorry, ma'am.

242
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:11,112
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I pay for the first page.

243
00:22:11,282 --> 00:22:14,445
Ladies and Gentlemen,
that something important is this.

244
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:18,015
When young Harry climbed
at Flourish and Blotts this morning...

245
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:22,284
…to buy my autobiography,
I'm the most important...

246
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:28,663
…which, by the way,
is now celebrating...

247
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:33,667
…his 27th week at the top
the Daily Prophet’s bestseller list…

248
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:38,331
...didn't know if he would,
in fact, it’s going to…

249
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:44,413
…with all my work collection…

250
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:47,210
...it's free.

251
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:51,616
Now, ladies?

252
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:55,017
Harry, now you give me that,
and I’ll have them signed.

253
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:58,684
You all wait outside.
That's it.

254
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:10,496
I hope you enjoyed that,
Right, Potter?

255
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:15,168
Harry Potter legends. I can't access
a book that doesn’t make the front page.

256
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:17,508
Leave him alone.

257
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:21,173
Look, Potter.
You’ve got a friend.

258
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:25,379
Now, now, Draco, good luck.

259
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,017
Mr. Potter.

260
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,419
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

261
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:35,792
Forgive me.

262
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,226
Your scar is legendary.

263
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,034
As, of course, is the wizard
given to you.

264
00:23:42,373 --> 00:23:44,500
Voldemort killed my parents.

265
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,068
He was just a killer.

266
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:54,050
You have to be very brave
to say his name.

267
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,015
Or they are very stupid.

268
00:23:56,453 --> 00:23:59,980
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

269
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:04,857
And you must be Miss Granger.

270
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:11,997
Yes, Draco told me
all about you. And your parents.

271
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,098
Muggles, right?

272
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:28,143
Let me see.
Blond hair, empty voice...

273
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:32,885
...tatty, old books.

274
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:36,454
They must be the Weasleys.

275
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,919
i'm angry here.
Let's go outside.

276
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:42,793
-Okay, okay, okay. Adult Weasley.
-Lucius.

277
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:47,630
Working hard on that, Arthur,
all that extra fighting?

278
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:50,137
I hope you get paid for the extra time...

279
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:53,470
…but with the state of this,
I mean no.

280
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,010
What would be the point of embarrassment
in the name of the wizard...

281
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:01,242
…if you don’t get paid well?

282
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:06,546
We have a completely different view of
mocking the wizard's name, Malfoy.

283
00:25:06,824 --> 00:25:08,621
Certain.

284
00:25:10,694 --> 00:25:14,391
Hanging out with Muggles.

285
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:23,198
And I thought your family
he couldn’t go any lower.

286
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,308
See you in action.

287
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,816
See you at school.

288
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,323
-1 0:58. Come on.
-The train will leave at any time.

289
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:49,762
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

290
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:56,999
Good.

291
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,775
After you, darling.

292
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,181
Come on, Ginny,
we will give you a seat. Hurry.

293
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:13,548
Let's go.

294
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:30,634
-What do you think you're doing?
-I'm sorry.

295
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:34,066
He lost control of the stroller.

296
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:37,744
-Why can't we pass?
-I don't know.

297
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:41,282
The door is locked
itself in some way.

298
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:46,589
The train leaves at 1 1 :00.
We have lost it.

299
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:50,124
Harry, if we can't get through...

300
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:53,089
…maybe Mom and Dad can’t come back.

301
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:57,500
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

302
00:26:58,569 --> 00:26:59,900
The car.

303
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:09,142
There we go.

304
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:12,942
Now, all we need to do is
is finding the Hogwarts Express.

305
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:15,542
Ron, are you sure
how do I throw this?

306
00:27:15,782 --> 00:27:17,382
No problem.

307
00:27:23,982 --> 00:27:25,702
Be careful!

308
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:33,417
Ron, I have to tell you…

309
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:37,357
…most Muggles are uneducated
to see a flying car.

310
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:38,621
Right.

311
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:39,952
Good.

312
00:27:57,248 --> 00:28:00,547
Oh, no! The lnvisibility Booster
It must be bad.

313
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,147
Come on, then. Let’s go deeper.
We need to find the train.

314
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:05,584
Good.

315
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:18,559
We just have to win
by train.

316
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:20,397
We can't be far away.

317
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:25,137
-Do you hear that?
-We need to get closer.

318
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,671
Wait.

319
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:56,132
Harry!

320
00:28:58,776 --> 00:29:00,607
Wait!

321
00:29:03,948 --> 00:29:06,439
Take my hand!

322
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:11,950
Wait!

323
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:15,718
I’m trying. Your hands are cold.

324
00:29:28,306 --> 00:29:31,605
- I think we found the train.
-Whether.

325
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:49,521
Come home.

326
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:06,905
Up! Up!

327
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:10,006
It doesn’t work!

328
00:30:13,952 --> 00:30:16,512
Up! Ron, think of the tree!

329
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,918
Stop! Stop! Stop!

330
00:30:45,016 --> 00:30:49,646
-My tree. Look at my tree.
-Thank goodness it's not your ass.

331
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:54,258
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

332
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,854
Come on, come on! Fast!

333
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,028
Scabbers, you’re welcome.

334
00:32:10,003 --> 00:32:12,028
The car!

335
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,318
My father will kill me.

336
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:40,229
We’ll see, Hedwig.

337
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:43,900
So a house-elf appears
in my room...

338
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,039
…we can’t get through the barrier
on platform 9 3/4...

339
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:50,438
…nearly killed by a tree….

340
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,137
Obviously someone doesn’t want me
here this year.

341
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,685
Well, look carefully, boys.

342
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:04,789
Tonight might be
the last experience in this castle.

343
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:11,086
Oh dear, we are in trouble!

344
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:17,564
You saw out of nowhere
that chicome Muggles.

345
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:20,768
Do you have an idea
how big is this?

346
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:25,308
You’re worried
the reflection of our world.

347
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:28,914
You don’t have to mention the damage you caused
gives her a Whomping Willow...

348
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:32,210
...from this site
even before you were born.

349
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:36,246
Sincerely, Professor Snape,
i think it affected us a lot.

350
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:37,582
Silence.

351
00:33:39,592 --> 00:33:45,963
I suggest that if you were in Slytherin,
and your fate was with me...

352
00:33:46,132 --> 00:33:49,898
…you guys would be
on the return train tonight.

353
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,334
-It's--
-They're not.

354
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:59,602
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

355
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:01,469
Guidance...

356
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:06,449
…these boys broke the rules
for the cognitive impairment of age groups.

357
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:10,521
-So--
-I'm well aware of our rules, Severus...

358
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,557
...already written
some of them myself.

359
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:17,157
However, as Head of Gryffindor House...

360
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:22,324
... is for Professor McGonagall
to know what to do.

361
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:24,963
So we're going to get our stuff.

362
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:27,572
What are you
speaking of, Mr. Weasley?

363
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,935
It'll get me out, won't it?

364
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:34,639
Not now, Mr. Weasley…

365
00:34:34,814 --> 00:34:39,808
…but I have to encourage you guys
the greatness of what you have done.

366
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:44,983
Tonight I will write to your families,
and you will receive punishment.

367
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:13,244
Mr. Filch, you left this.

368
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:50,636
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning, Professor Sprout.

369
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:55,114
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
two years. Gather everyone.

370
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,083
We will now return to the mandrakes.

371
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:02,248
Can anyone here tell me
the properties of Mandrake?

372
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,291
Yes, Mrs. Granger?

373
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:06,759
Mandrake, O Mandrake…

374
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,958
…is used to get them back from her
Petrified in their original state.

375
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:17,129
it’s also dangerous. The Mandrake
screams will die for those who hear them.

376
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:20,140
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

377
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,972
Like our Mandrakes
still just seeds...

378
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:25,046
…screams won’t kill you anymore.

379
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:29,015
But they could throw you for hours,
that's why I gave you punishment...

380
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,676
…for hearing protection.

381
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:35,291
So, you can add them,
immediately? Prompt.

382
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,257
Punishment is very low,
and look at me carefully.

383
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:41,420
You hold your Mandragora tightly.

384
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:44,590
You remove it violently from the pot.

385
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:50,772
Got it? And...

386
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:53,101
…now you throw
in the other pot…

387
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:57,975
…and add some space
to cool down.

388
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:04,815
Longbottom ignores
removed.

389
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:09,282
-No, ma'am, he's just upset.
-Yeah, well, just leave it there.

390
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:13,220
Yes, we will.
Lots of holes to move around.

391
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,958
Grab your Mandrake and pull it out.

392
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:35,681
-There's Nick without a head.
-Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

393
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:38,412
Good morning, Sir Nicholas.

394
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,165
Say it. this is over.

395
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,738
-You'll be done.
-Okay, Harry.

396
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,705
that’s Colin Creevey. I’m in Gryffindor too.

397
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:04,093
-Hi, Colin, nice to meet you.
-Say, you think your friend here...

398
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:06,613
…I can take a picture
that you and I stand together?

399
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:09,373
You know, to say I know you.
it’s for my father.

400
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:13,093
He’s a milkman, you know. If Muggles,
like everyone in our family is including me.

401
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,973
No one knew that all I could do was
magic until we got our letters from Hogwarts.

402
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,973
Everyone just thought l was mental.

403
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:21,413
Imagine that.

404
00:38:22,263 --> 00:38:24,094
Ron, is that your dog?

405
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:41,508
The bloody bird is a target.

406
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,210
No.

407
00:38:47,388 --> 00:38:50,846
Look, everyone.
Weasley is holding a Howler.

408
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:58,007
Go away, Ron. I missed a
from my gran once. it was so bad.

409
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:07,052
Ronald Weasley!

410
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:15,755
How dare you steal the car!
I’m so angry!

411
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,658
Your father is now facing
a question at work...

412
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:21,200
…and it’s all your fault!

413
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,538
If you put your other foot wrong...

414
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:28,972
… we’ll take you straight home!

415
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:32,737
And, Ginny, honey, thank you
in creating Gryffindor.

416
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:36,646
Your father and I are so proud.

417
00:39:54,904 --> 00:40:01,332
Allow me to introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

418
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,034
Me.

419
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:05,737
Gilderoy Lockhart...

420
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:09,214
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

421
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:12,718
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

422
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:15,789
…and five-time winner…

423
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:22,030
...from Witch Weekly's
Most Charming-Smile Award.

424
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:23,888
But I’m not talking about that.

425
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:28,594
I didn’t download the Bandon Banshee
with a smile to him.

426
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:35,781
I see you all bought one last
one of my books. Well done.

427
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:41,341
Now, I thought we were going to start today
with one small question.

428
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:45,301
It’s nothing to worry about.

429
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:49,061
Just to see how good
you’ve read them.

430
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:50,781
Thank you.

431
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:55,301
How many you have.

432
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:03,901
Consider this question.
Everything is about him.

433
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,221
''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
your favorite?''

434
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:12,381
''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
the biggest thing you've done so far?''

435
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:18,141
You have 30 minutes. Start...

436
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:23,021
...now.

437
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:35,341
None of you thought
that my favorite color is lilac.

438
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,461
But Miss Hermione Granger knew…

439
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,541
...of my secret plan
is to rid the world of evil….

440
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:47,341
…and sell mine
preventative medications. Good girl.

441
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,372
Now, be careful.

442
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:53,700
it’s my job to give you…

443
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:59,179
…on the monsters
known to wizardkind.

444
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,611
You may find yourselves facing
what scares you the most in this room.

445
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:07,814
Just know that nothing
it might happen to you while I’m here.

446
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:10,926
I have to ask you not to scream.

447
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:13,654
it can hurt them.

448
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:18,513
Cornish pixies?

449
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,716
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

450
00:42:22,527 --> 00:42:24,654
Laugh if you like, Mr. Finnegan...

451
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,994
…but pixies can be
little gems are very deceiving.

452
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:32,068
Let's see what you do with them.

453
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:39,673
Come now, gather them.
They’re just pixies.

454
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,556
-Just stay there!
-Look for me!

455
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,368
-Get off me!
-Stop. Stop!

456
00:43:06,004 --> 00:43:09,201
Pescipiksi Pesternomy!

457
00:43:29,194 --> 00:43:33,460
I'll ask you for three years just nip
the others returned to their boxes.

458
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:37,394
What are we doing now?

459
00:43:38,904 --> 00:43:40,394
lmmobulus!

460
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:52,179
Why is it always me?

461
00:43:58,523 --> 00:44:01,219
I spent the summer
a new Quidditch lesson.

462
00:44:01,393 --> 00:44:05,056
We will learn first,
stronger and longer.

463
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,529
What is--? I don’t believe it.

464
00:44:11,303 --> 00:44:13,999
-Where do you think you're going, Flint?
-Quidditch practice.

465
00:44:14,172 --> 00:44:18,575
-l reserved the spot for Gryffindor today.
-Easy, box. i have a book.

466
00:44:19,978 --> 00:44:22,173
l smell pain.

467
00:44:22,781 --> 00:44:26,308
''l, Professor Severus Snape,
with this give it to the Slytherin team…

468
00:44:26,485 --> 00:44:29,977
...opportunity to learn now, because
to have to train their new Seeker.''

469
00:44:30,155 --> 00:44:32,817
You have a new researcher. Subject?

470
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:39,423
-Malfoy?
-Of course.

471
00:44:39,598 --> 00:44:42,362
And that’s not all
new this year.

472
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:46,637
The Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you come up with that?

473
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:48,898
A gift from Draco's father.

474
00:44:49,074 --> 00:44:52,805
You see, Weasley, unlike most,
my dad can afford the best.

475
00:44:52,978 --> 00:44:55,970
No one on the Gryffindor team
they had to buy their way through.

476
00:44:56,148 --> 00:44:59,083
They came in with a good amount of talent.

477
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:06,155
No one asked you what you thought,
you dirty little Mudblood.

478
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,118
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat worms!

479
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:21,536
Are you okay, Ron?

480
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:26,340
Say something.

481
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:37,112
-Wow! Can you take it back, Harry?
-No, Colin, get out of the way.

482
00:45:38,023 --> 00:45:40,048
Let's take it to Hagrid.

483
00:45:40,225 --> 00:45:42,352
He will know what to do.

484
00:45:51,236 --> 00:45:54,603
This question
a very sophisticated weapon.

485
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:01,971
You have no choice but to wait until it’s over,
i'm afraid.

486
00:46:02,614 --> 00:46:05,811
-Good.
-Better out than in.

487
00:46:06,384 --> 00:46:11,720
-Who wanted to curse Ron, anyway?
-Malfoy. Kinotski Hermione….

488
00:46:12,924 --> 00:46:16,360
Well, I don’t know
it means the same thing.

489
00:46:20,332 --> 00:46:22,527
Called me a Mudblood.

490
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:25,363
-He didn't.
-What is a Mudblood?

491
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:30,265
means ''mudblood.'' Mudblood is a real
not a good name for someone who was Muggle-born.

492
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:34,708
Someone with non-magical parents.
Someone like me.

493
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:39,343
is not a word one usually hears
in general terms.

494
00:46:40,485 --> 00:46:45,286
See, the thing is, Harry, there’s
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

495
00:46:45,457 --> 00:46:50,121
…who think they’re better than everyone else
because they are pure-blooded.

496
00:46:50,295 --> 00:46:51,922
It’s really bad.

497
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:56,264
it’s so bad.

498
00:46:56,434 --> 00:46:59,926
And it’s codswallop to stand up.
Dirty blood.

499
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:03,472
Why, there isn’t a witch alive today
that’s not half blood or nothing.

500
00:47:03,642 --> 00:47:08,204
More than that, they still haven’t figured out
which is a word our Hermione can’t handle.

501
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,575
Come here.

502
00:47:11,683 --> 00:47:18,145
Don't think about it, Hermione.
Don’t think about that for a minute.

503
00:47:25,931 --> 00:47:28,957
Harry, Harry, Harry.

504
00:47:29,134 --> 00:47:31,364
Can you imagine...

505
00:47:31,536 --> 00:47:34,767
…a good way to punish…

506
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:38,103
…to help us
to answer my email?

507
00:47:38,276 --> 00:47:39,675
Not really.

508
00:47:39,844 --> 00:47:46,215
Fame is a fickle friend of mine, Harry.
Knowledge is like knowledge.

509
00:47:46,384 --> 00:47:48,318
Remember that.

510
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,251
Come.

511
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:56,519
Come...

512
00:47:57,796 --> 00:48:00,663
...for me.

513
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:06,294
-What is?
-I'm sorry?

514
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,508
The language.

515
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:12,199
Voice?

516
00:48:15,781 --> 00:48:20,411
-Haven't you heard?
"What are you talking about, Harry?"

517
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:24,614
I hope you get
a little sleepy.

518
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:28,851
And hey Scott, no surprise. Check out the
life. We’ve been here for about four hours.

519
00:48:29,161 --> 00:48:32,528
It's scary how time flies
when one is satisfied.

520
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:40,027
It was scary.

521
00:48:43,074 --> 00:48:45,201
Blood.

522
00:48:45,377 --> 00:48:48,904
l smell blood.

523
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,174
Let me cut it for you.

524
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,945
Let me kill you.

525
00:48:57,756 --> 00:48:59,223
Death!

526
00:49:00,158 --> 00:49:01,489
Death!

527
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:04,128
-Death!
-Harry!

528
00:49:04,296 --> 00:49:06,764
-Did you hear?
-You hear what?

529
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:10,368
-The language.
-Voice? What language?

530
00:49:10,535 --> 00:49:14,494
l heard it first in Lockhart’s work.
And then again just--

531
00:49:14,773 --> 00:49:16,866
it’s time.

532
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:20,239
you move.
l think he's going to kill.

533
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:25,172
-Death?
-Harry, wait! Not fast enough!

534
00:49:50,742 --> 00:49:52,801
Strange.

535
00:49:53,345 --> 00:49:57,839
-I've never seen spiders do that before.
-I don't like spiders.

536
00:50:01,953 --> 00:50:04,012
What is it?

537
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:11,987
''The Chamber of Secrets has been
open. Enemies of the Heir, beware.''

538
00:50:12,163 --> 00:50:14,427
written in blood.

539
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:19,530
No.

540
00:50:24,242 --> 00:50:26,506
it’s Filch’s dog.

541
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:29,309
this is Mrs. Norris.

542
00:50:45,397 --> 00:50:48,093
''Enemies of the Heir, beware.''

543
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:51,967
You’ll be next, Mudbloods.

544
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:57,302
What's going on here?
Go away. Make way, make way.

545
00:50:58,777 --> 00:51:00,608
Potter?

546
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:02,906
What are you...?

547
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:08,515
Mrs. Norris?

548
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:14,185
-You killed my dog.
-No. No.

549
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:15,855
I will kill you.

550
00:51:18,196 --> 00:51:21,029
-will kill you!
-Argus!

551
00:51:22,434 --> 00:51:24,561
Argus, l….

552
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:31,201
Everyone is going
in their room immediately.

553
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:33,911
Everyone just...

554
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:36,908
...of three.

555
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,814
Ravenclaws, follow me.

556
00:51:43,688 --> 00:51:47,556
He’s not dead, Argus.
He is very upset.

557
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:50,559
I thought.
So it sucks that I wasn’t there.

558
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:53,926
I know the translation is true
that could have saved him.

559
00:51:56,267 --> 00:51:58,895
But how desperate he is,
I can’t say.

560
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,866
Ask him.
he’s the one doing it.

561
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,736
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

562
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:09,005
Not really, sir. l swear.
I never met Mrs. Norris.

563
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,617
-Trash.
-lf l could, teacher?

564
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:18,886
Maybe Potter and his friends just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

565
00:52:19,391 --> 00:52:21,291
Though...

566
00:52:21,626 --> 00:52:24,595
…the situation is unfortunate.

567
00:52:24,763 --> 00:52:29,393
l, one, I don't remember
he sees Potter at lunch.

568
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,831
I'm afraid that's what I do, Severus.

569
00:52:32,003 --> 00:52:35,404
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my letters.

570
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:38,872
So Ron and l
He went to find her, Master.

571
00:52:39,044 --> 00:52:41,774
We had just met him when he said….

572
00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:47,883
“Yes, Mrs. Granger?”
-Yeah I said I wasn't hungry.

573
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:53,247
We returned to the common
house when we found Mrs. Norris.

574
00:52:55,593 --> 00:53:01,122
-lnnocent until proven guilty, Severus.
-My dog ​​is petrified.

575
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:07,802
-n I want to see a punishment!
-We can cure him, Argus.

576
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:13,507
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
it has a strong flavor of Mandrake.

577
00:53:13,678 --> 00:53:18,115
Once mature, a vaccine will be developed
which will comfort Mrs. Norris.

578
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,145
And in the meantime…

579
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,712
...I strongly say be careful...

580
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,358
...for everyone.

581
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:41,839
-a bit weird, isn’t it?
-Strange?

582
00:53:42,006 --> 00:53:44,770
You hear this voice;
a voice only you can hear…

583
00:53:44,943 --> 00:53:49,642
…and then Mrs. Norris shows up
Petrified. it’s just plain weird.

584
00:53:49,814 --> 00:53:53,045
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

585
00:53:53,218 --> 00:53:54,685
Are you angry?

586
00:53:54,853 --> 00:54:00,348
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
Hearing voices is not a good sign.

587
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,826
He’s right, you know.

588
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:11,499
Can I have your attention,
please?

589
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:17,531
Right. Safe, however,
we change animals...

590
00:54:17,709 --> 00:54:20,075
...in the water.

591
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:22,673
That's right.

592
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:27,750
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

593
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:35,224
Now it's your turn.
Who would want to go first?

594
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:40,787
Mr. Weasley.
''One, two, three. Vera Verto.''

595
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:46,462
Vera Verto!

596
00:54:52,577 --> 00:54:55,239
The tree needs to be replaced,
Mr. Weasley.

597
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:58,742
“Yes, Mrs. Granger?”
-Teacher...

598
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:03,115
… I was wondering if you could tell me
of the Chamber of Secrets.

599
00:55:09,294 --> 00:55:10,556
Very good.

600
00:55:12,063 --> 00:55:14,054
You all know, of course…

601
00:55:14,232 --> 00:55:18,100
… that Hogwarts was built
over a thousand years ago...

602
00:55:18,269 --> 00:55:22,706
…with the Four Great Wizards
and contemporary witches:

603
00:55:22,874 --> 00:55:26,605
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

604
00:55:26,778 --> 00:55:32,410
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

605
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:39,080
Now, three of the founders
they lived together in peace.

606
00:55:39,257 --> 00:55:42,283
-One doesn't.
-Three words of.

607
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:45,461
Salazar Slytherin wanted to be
more choices...

608
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:48,793
…of the admitted students
to Hogwarts.

609
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:53,563
He believed that teaching magic required
may it remain in the families of all magic.

610
00:55:53,738 --> 00:55:55,831
in other words, pure blood.

611
00:55:56,241 --> 00:56:01,577
I can’t influence others,
decided to drop out of school.

612
00:56:02,413 --> 00:56:04,643
Now, according to the story…

613
00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:08,547
…Slytherin created
a hidden room in this castle...

614
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,349
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

615
00:56:12,523 --> 00:56:16,960
However, before we go,
he had stopped her...

616
00:56:17,128 --> 00:56:21,258
…until the day his
indeed Heir returned to the school.

617
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,798
Only the Heir...

618
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:26,630
…can open the door…

619
00:56:26,804 --> 00:56:31,571
…and take the fear out of it,
and with that...

620
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:35,110
…clean the school
of all that...

621
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,274
…from Slytherin’s point of view,
they were not supposed to learn magic.

622
00:56:40,885 --> 00:56:43,012
Muggle-borns.

623
00:56:44,088 --> 00:56:47,683
As a result, the school
has been researched many times.

624
00:56:47,859 --> 00:56:51,317
There is no such house.

625
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:56,560
Teacher? What exactly does the legend mean
tell me lies in the Chamber?

626
00:56:57,402 --> 00:56:59,996
The house is said to be home
for a reason...

627
00:57:00,171 --> 00:57:03,732
…except for the Heir of Slytherin
he can control it.

628
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:08,004
they say it’s the house…

629
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:09,806
...of a monster.

630
00:57:15,553 --> 00:57:19,216
Do you think it's true? Do you think
is there really a Chamber of Secrets?

631
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:23,588
Whether. Couldn’t you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All students are.

632
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:27,629
If there is indeed a safe house,
and it's actually been opened, that is--

633
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:31,735
The Heir of Slytherin is back
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is he?

634
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:36,272
Let’s think about it. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are trash?

635
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:39,103
-if you're talking about Malfoy--
-Of course. You heard it.

636
00:57:39,277 --> 00:57:41,006
''You'll be next, Mudbloods.''

637
00:57:41,179 --> 00:57:43,773
l heard.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

638
00:57:43,948 --> 00:57:47,111
Maybe Ron is right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

639
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:50,083
Everything about them is
in Slytherin for years.

640
00:57:50,254 --> 00:57:53,690
Crabbe and Goyle should know.
We could have tricked them into telling us.

641
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:58,289
Even they are not that thick.
But there may be another way.

642
00:57:58,463 --> 00:58:00,328
Mind you, it’s going to be hard.

643
00:58:00,498 --> 00:58:03,524
Not to mention that we would play
about 50 school rules...

644
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:08,161
…and it will be dangerous.
It’s very dangerous.

645
00:58:14,979 --> 00:58:17,447
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

646
00:58:17,615 --> 00:58:20,345
''With proper formulation, the Polyjuice Potion
it leaves the drinker...

647
00:58:20,518 --> 00:58:24,750
…for a slight change
in the body of another.''

648
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:28,722
You mean if Harry and I drink the stuff,
switch Crabbe and Goyle?

649
00:58:28,893 --> 00:58:32,260
-Evil! Malfoy will tell us anything.
-Exactly.

650
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:36,298
But it’s hard. I’ve never seen
a more complex potion.

651
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:39,561
-How long will it take to do it?
-A month.

652
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:41,404
A month?

653
00:58:41,572 --> 00:58:45,406
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin…

654
00:58:45,576 --> 00:58:48,773
...can attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school at the time.

655
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:50,846
I know.

656
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:53,848
But that's the only knowledge we have.

657
00:59:43,534 --> 00:59:46,230
Another goal for Slytherin!

658
00:59:47,572 --> 00:59:50,973
Led Gryffindor 90 to 30.

659
00:59:52,143 --> 00:59:53,701
Whether!

660
00:59:53,978 --> 00:59:55,741
Whether!

661
01:00:20,004 --> 01:00:22,336
All right, Scarhead?

662
01:00:28,446 --> 01:00:30,937
Take care, Harry!

663
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:33,112
Be careful!

664
01:00:46,797 --> 01:00:49,630
Blimey! Harry has his own
a bad Bludger.

665
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,563
It’s been destroyed, it’s been done.

666
01:00:52,603 ​​​ --> 01:00:53,592
I’ll finish it.

667
01:00:53,771 --> 01:00:58,401
No! Even with a good frame,
very dangerous. You can kiss Harry.

668
01:01:43,217 --> 01:01:45,811
Are you training for the ballet, Potter?

669
01:02:16,784 --> 01:02:19,014
You'll never touch me, Potter.

670
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:50,869
Let's go.

671
01:03:51,045 --> 01:03:56,278
Harry Potter caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!

672
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,615
Lncantatem at last!

673
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:13,030
-Thank you.
-Are you okay?

674
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:15,294
No. I think my hands are broken.

675
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:19,270
Don't worry, Harry. I will fix
the arm is straight.

676
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,375
-Not you.
-The boy doesn't know what he's talking about.

677
01:04:22,543 --> 01:04:26,070
This won’t hurt you at all.

678
01:04:32,186 --> 01:04:35,178
Brackium Amendo!

679
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:46,325
Yes, well,
which can sometimes happen...

680
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:48,731
...but the thing is...

681
01:04:50,138 --> 01:04:54,234
…you can no longer feel any pain, and,
Fortunately, the bone is not broken.

682
01:04:54,408 --> 01:04:57,070
Broken? Not a single bone is left.

683
01:04:58,779 --> 01:05:00,747
However, it is much more flexible.

684
01:05:03,217 --> 01:05:07,153
Mr. Malfoy, stop playing the game.
You can go. Get out of my way.

685
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:09,255
They had to carry
right to me.

686
01:05:09,423 --> 01:05:11,948
I can straighten bones with a swing,
but they are reborn….

687
01:05:12,126 --> 01:05:13,616
You can, right?

688
01:05:13,794 --> 01:05:16,922
Possibly, of course.
But it will be very painful.

689
01:05:17,565 --> 01:05:22,229
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bone is a messy process.

690
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:28,131
What are you waiting for?
Pumpkin juice?

691
01:05:34,782 --> 01:05:36,545
Death.

692
01:05:37,385 --> 01:05:38,909
Death.

693
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:47,523
Time to kill.

694
01:05:53,668 --> 01:05:54,657
Hello.

695
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,494
Dobby?

696
01:05:57,672 --> 01:06:00,004
Harry Potter should have listened
with Dobby.

697
01:06:00,474 --> 01:06:04,205
Harry Potter had to go home
when he missed the train.

698
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:08,974
it was you. You have closed the lock
which allowed Ron and I to pass.

699
01:06:09,283 --> 01:06:12,252
certain. Yes, sir.

700
01:06:13,254 --> 01:06:18,282
-Ron and I almost got kicked out.
-At least you'll be away from here.

701
01:06:18,459 --> 01:06:21,121
Harry Potter needs to go home.

702
01:06:21,295 --> 01:06:24,890
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
it's enough to make Harry Potter see--

703
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:28,433
Your Bludger? You did
that Bludger is chasing me?

704
01:06:28,603 --> 01:06:32,164
Dobby is very sorry, sir.

705
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,969
Dobby had to fold his arms.

706
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:42,775
You better apologize in front of my bones
back off, Dobby, or I might strangle you.

707
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:50,618
Dobby is used to death, sir.
Dobby hosts them five times a day at his house.

708
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:53,555
i don't think you could tell me
why do you want to kill me?

709
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:57,729
I will not kill you, sir.
You should never be killed.

710
01:06:57,898 --> 01:07:01,265
Dobby remembers what it was like
before Harry Potter won...

711
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:04,529
...in He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

712
01:07:04,705 --> 01:07:08,402
We are the house elves
they treat him like an animal, sir.

713
01:07:08,576 --> 01:07:14,014
Of course, Dobby still
they treat him like an animal.

714
01:07:23,357 --> 01:07:25,985
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

715
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:31,291
Is it, sir? is a brand
from the servant of the house-elf.

716
01:07:31,465 --> 01:07:36,562
Dobby can only be removed if his owner
she gives him clothes.

717
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:40,071
Listen.

718
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:41,765
Listen!

719
01:07:41,942 --> 01:07:45,673
Scary Things
it's about to happen at Hogwarts.

720
01:07:46,314 --> 01:07:48,748
Harry Potter doesn’t have to stop here…

721
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:53,444
…now the history
is to repeat itself.

722
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:57,079
Does it come back on its own? You mean
has this happened before?

723
01:07:57,258 --> 01:07:59,249
I shouldn’t have said that.

724
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:06,125
-No good Dobby! Bad!
-Stop!

725
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,995
Stop, Dobby!

726
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:13,470
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who’s doing it now?

727
01:08:13,441 --> 01:08:18,674
Dobby can't say, sir. Dobby
he just wants Harry Potter to be okay.

728
01:08:18,846 --> 01:08:21,747
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is he?

729
01:08:33,594 --> 01:08:34,686
Put it here.

730
01:08:39,267 --> 01:08:42,202
-What happened?
-There's another battle.

731
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:48,172
I think he's really upset,
Lady Pomfrey.

732
01:08:48,943 --> 01:08:53,642
Look. Maybe he could
to take a picture of his attack.

733
01:09:01,756 --> 01:09:04,520
What does this mean, Albus?

734
01:09:04,692 --> 01:09:06,626
means...

735
01:09:06,994 --> 01:09:09,758
...from our students
they are in grave danger.

736
01:09:09,931 --> 01:09:13,332
-What should I tell the employee?
-Guarantee.

737
01:09:13,601 --> 01:09:17,401
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer protected.

738
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:20,673
it's like we were afraid, Minerva.

739
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:25,470
The storage room
they’ve actually reopened.

740
01:09:28,316 --> 01:09:32,446
Again? You mean the house
which Secrets have been unlocked before?

741
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:35,350
Of course.
Don't you see?

742
01:09:35,523 --> 01:09:38,549
Lucius Malfoy had to open
while teaching here.

743
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,754
-Now he's teaching Draco how to do it.
-Maybe.

744
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:45,092
We’ll have to wait
the Polyjuice Potion to find out the truth.

745
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:49,202
Enlighten me. Why do we do
this potion in light...

746
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:53,329
…in the middle of the girls’ bathroom?
Don't you think they'll catch me?

747
01:09:54,242 --> 01:09:56,904
No. No one ever comes in here.

748
01:09:57,745 --> 01:10:00,270
-Why?
-Moaning Myrtle.

749
01:10:00,448 --> 01:10:02,416
Subject?

750
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:04,646
Myrtle exclaims.

751
01:10:04,819 --> 01:10:08,220
-Who's calling Myrtle?
-by Moaning Myrtle.

752
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:16,527
I wouldn’t expect you to recognize me.

753
01:10:16,697 --> 01:10:19,723
Who could speak
bad, bad...

754
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:23,301
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

755
01:10:30,511 --> 01:10:32,638
He’s a little sensitive.

756
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:39,085
Get together!

757
01:10:39,453 --> 01:10:44,413
Get together.
Can everyone see me?

758
01:10:44,592 --> 01:10:47,720
Can you all hear me?

759
01:10:48,396 --> 01:10:49,727
Excellent.

760
01:10:50,231 --> 01:10:53,928
in dim lighting
past weeks...

761
01:10:54,101 --> 01:10:58,800
…Professor Dumbledore gave me
permission to start this Dueling Club…

762
01:10:58,973 --> 01:11:03,603
...to teach you all if
We need to protect ourselves...

763
01:11:03,778 --> 01:11:06,338
…as I have done myself
on several occasions.

764
01:11:06,514 --> 01:11:10,177
For all cases,
see my work described above.

765
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:18,410
The Lockhart is something, isn’t it?
Very strong chap.

766
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,770
-Justin Finch-Fletchley. Hufflepuff.
-Nice to meet you. I--

767
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:25,330
I know who you are. We all do it.
Even us Muggle-borns.

768
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,517
Let me introduce my assistant…

769
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:31,070
...Professor Snape.

770
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,179
He is willing to help
with a short-term appearance.

771
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:39,376
I don’t want any of you
young people should be concerned.

772
01:11:39,553 --> 01:11:44,513
You’ll still have your Potions master
when you’re done with him. Never be afraid.

773
01:12:00,174 --> 01:12:01,163
An.

774
01:12:02,009 --> 01:12:02,998
Two.

775
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:06,837
-Three!
-Expelliarmus!

776
01:12:15,422 --> 01:12:18,084
-Do you think he's okay?
-Who cares?

777
01:12:18,258 --> 01:12:21,227
A good idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

778
01:12:21,395 --> 01:12:25,957
…but if you don’t mind me saying, it was
it’s very clear what you wanted to do.

779
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,364
if I wanted to stop you,
it would just be too easy.

780
01:12:29,536 --> 01:12:32,994
It could be good
before teaching students...

781
01:12:33,173 --> 01:12:37,667
…to suppress negative speech,
teacher.

782
01:12:39,413 --> 01:12:41,847
A good point,
Professor Snape.

783
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:47,349
Let’s have a couple of contributors.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

784
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:51,013
Weasley's wand causes damage
in the simplest terms.

785
01:12:51,425 --> 01:12:55,156
Shipping Potter
in the hospital wing in a matchbox.

786
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:59,390
I can tell someone
from my house?

787
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,136
Malfoy, maybe?

788
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,146
-Goodbye, Potter.
-Thank you, sir.

789
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:23,112
Ready-made rods.

790
01:13:23,724 --> 01:13:26,716
-Afraid, Potter?
-You want it.

791
01:13:37,137 --> 01:13:38,866
In the story of the three...

792
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:43,373
...shoot your toys to take out your weapon
your opponent. Just to get your guns out.

793
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:47,071
We don’t want any accidents here.
An.

794
01:13:48,849 --> 01:13:51,409
-Two.
-Everte Statum!

795
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,293
Always right!

796
01:14:16,276 --> 01:14:18,073
l said just smile.

797
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,213
Serpensortia!

798
01:14:28,889 --> 01:14:31,687
Don't worry, Potter.
i'll get it out for you.

799
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:37,297
Excuse me, Professor Snape.
Ascendare Alert!

800
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,502
Vipera Evanesca.

801
01:15:29,216 --> 01:15:31,582
What are you playing?

802
01:15:44,364 --> 01:15:47,060
Are you a parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell me?

803
01:15:47,234 --> 01:15:49,498
-me what?
-You can talk to snakes.

804
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:54,972
I know. personally I didn't want to install a python
to my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

805
01:15:55,142 --> 01:15:59,101
Ever. But what?
i think a lot of people here can do it.

806
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:03,045
No, they can’t.
It's not a popular gift, Harry.

807
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:05,245
This is not good.

808
01:16:05,419 --> 01:16:09,150
What's wrong? if I hadn’t said
the snake won't attack Justin--

809
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:12,815
-That's what you said.
-You were there. You listened to me.

810
01:16:12,993 --> 01:16:16,895
I heard you speak Parseltongue.
Snake language.

811
01:16:17,064 --> 01:16:19,931
l spoke another language?

812
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:23,401
But I didn't know--

813
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:26,334
How can I speak a language
i don't know l can?

814
01:16:26,506 --> 01:16:30,533
I don’t know, but it looked like you
he was scratching the snake or something.

815
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,406
Harry, listen to me.

816
01:16:32,813 --> 01:16:35,680
There’s a reason why the show
of Slytherin house is a snake.

817
01:16:35,849 --> 01:16:40,377
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could also talk to snakes.

818
01:16:40,621 --> 01:16:41,645
Exactly.

819
01:16:41,822 --> 01:16:45,189
Now the whole school will think
you are his great-grandson.

820
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:47,350
But no.

821
01:16:50,097 --> 01:16:52,031
would.

822
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,191
He lived a thousand years ago.

823
01:16:55,369 --> 01:16:58,600
For all we know, you could be.

824
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,060
Who am I, Hedwig?

825
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,820
What am I l?

826
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,868
I'll see you back in the meeting room.

827
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:13,830
Instead, I told Justin to hide
in our home.

828
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:18,190
I mean, if Potter's
set him up as his next victim...

829
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:21,150
...best of luck
an understatement for a while.

830
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:23,950
But why would he want to mess with Justin?

831
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:29,030
Well, Justin let Potter pass
that she was Muggle-born.

832
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:32,870
And you really think Potter
the Heir of Slytherin?

833
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:36,390
Hannah, she’s a Parselmouth.

834
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:39,350
Everyone knows it’s the brand
of a dark wizard.

835
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:43,630
Have you ever heard of a good one?
who could talk to snakes?

836
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,910
Called Slytherin itself
Snake-language.

837
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:49,670
Harry always looks great, though.

838
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:54,430
And, after all, he is the one
resulting in the disappearance of You-Know-Who.

839
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:58,910
Maybe that’s why You-Know-Who
wanted to kill him in the first place.

840
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:02,390
I didn’t want another Dark Lord
they fought with him.

841
01:20:00,345 --> 01:20:04,611
I want blood.

842
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:12,513
They must all die.

843
01:20:13,091 --> 01:20:15,082
Death.

844
01:20:15,761 --> 01:20:17,854
Death.

845
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,928
Death.

846
01:20:21,266 --> 01:20:26,927
Time to kill.

847
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,630
They’ve seen it in the works.

848
01:21:03,799 --> 01:21:05,767
I'll take you out this time, Potter.

849
01:21:06,268 --> 01:21:08,759
Consider my words.

850
01:21:08,937 --> 01:21:13,169
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand--

851
01:21:39,935 --> 01:21:41,869
Teacher...

852
01:21:42,037 --> 01:21:43,402
...I swear I didn't.

853
01:21:43,572 --> 01:21:46,803
This is not my hand, Potter.

854
01:21:56,451 --> 01:21:59,113
Professor Dumbledore
they will wait for you.

855
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:10,623
Lemon sherbet.

856
01:22:44,566 --> 01:22:46,693
Professor Dumbledore?

857
01:23:03,185 --> 01:23:05,881
Bee in your throat, Potter?

858
01:23:08,757 --> 01:23:13,285
I just thought
if you put me in the right house.

859
01:23:13,461 --> 01:23:18,922
Whether. You were so
difficult to install.

860
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:22,627
But I stand by what I said last year.

861
01:23:22,804 --> 01:23:26,205
You would do well in Slytherin.

862
01:23:26,374 --> 01:23:27,705
It's not true.

863
01:23:56,972 --> 01:23:58,405
Harry?

864
01:23:58,773 --> 01:24:01,003
Teacher.

865
01:24:01,176 --> 01:24:04,976
Your bird...
There was nothing I could do.

866
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:08,879
-Just caught fire.
-And what time too.

867
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:12,049
He looked terrible most of the time.

868
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,245
Sad that you had to see
on a hot day.

869
01:24:16,157 --> 01:24:19,388
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

870
01:24:19,561 --> 01:24:22,928
They burned
when the time comes for them to die...

871
01:24:23,098 --> 01:24:25,191
...and then they...

872
01:24:25,367 --> 01:24:28,393
…born from the ashes.

873
01:24:36,811 --> 01:24:39,439
Fantastic animals, phoenixes.

874
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:43,783
It can carry heavy loads.

875
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:46,785
Their tears have healing powers.

876
01:24:49,391 --> 01:24:52,451
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

877
01:24:53,428 --> 01:24:55,555
Professor Dumbledore, my lord,
it wasn't Harry.

878
01:24:56,731 --> 01:24:59,598
I would be prepared to say
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

879
01:25:01,069 --> 01:25:02,969
Relax.

880
01:25:03,705 --> 01:25:05,673
I can't believe it...

881
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,173
-...that Harry had attacked someone.
-Of course not.

882
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:15,675
Right. Well, I will….

883
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:18,978
-I'll just wait outside, then.
-Whether.

884
01:25:22,657 --> 01:25:26,320
-You don't think it was me, Master?
-No, Harry.

885
01:25:26,494 --> 01:25:28,985
i don’t think it was you.

886
01:25:30,031 --> 01:25:31,828
But I have to ask you…

887
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,496
…there’s something
Do you want to tell me?

888
01:25:42,944 --> 01:25:44,878
No, sir.

889
01:25:45,046 --> 01:25:46,536
Nothing.

890
01:25:49,551 --> 01:25:51,712
Pretty good, then.

891
01:25:51,886 --> 01:25:53,683
Go away.

892
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:15,482
Look, everyone.
is the Heir of Slytherin.

893
01:26:15,642 --> 01:26:19,922
Be careful. He is a very wicked witch.

894
01:26:20,962 --> 01:26:23,922
Come on, Harry. Fred and George
we were just laughing.

895
01:26:24,082 --> 01:26:26,242
Just them.

896
01:26:26,402 --> 01:26:30,562
So half the school thinks you suck
in the Chamber of Secrets every night.

897
01:26:30,722 --> 01:26:31,762
Who cares?

898
01:26:32,482 --> 01:26:33,842
They may be right.

899
01:26:35,922 --> 01:26:39,002
Harry. Harry.

900
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:44,762
-Come on.
-I didn’t know I could speak Parseltongue.

901
01:26:45,442 --> 01:26:48,122
What else don’t I know about myself?

902
01:26:49,522 --> 01:26:51,162
Look...

903
01:26:52,522 --> 01:26:55,482
...maybe you can do something...

904
01:26:55,642 --> 01:27:00,122
…even if it’s a bad thing,
and I don’t know that you did.

905
01:27:00,522 --> 01:27:03,722
You don't believe that, Harry.
I know not.

906
01:27:04,682 --> 01:27:08,282
And if it makes you feel good,
Malfoy joins the party as well.

907
01:27:08,962 --> 01:27:11,242
Why would that make anyone
Are you feeling better?

908
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:15,802
Because at some point
the Polyjuice Potion is ready.

909
01:27:15,962 --> 01:27:21,362
at some point, we might actually know
who is the Heir of Slytherin.

910
01:27:46,827 --> 01:27:50,354
Everything is set. It just takes a little
of who you have become.

911
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:52,260
Crabbe and Goyle.

912
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:55,197
We should also consider
of the real Crabbe and Goyle...

913
01:27:55,369 --> 01:27:58,600
…you can’t blame us
when we ask Malfoy.

914
01:27:58,939 --> 01:28:01,635
-How?
-I've done everything.

915
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,369
I fill this
in a simple way.

916
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:07,309
Simple, but powerful.

917
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:09,709
Now, when they’re asleep…

918
01:28:09,883 --> 01:28:13,080
…keep them on the shelf
and shave some of their hair off...

919
01:28:13,253 --> 01:28:15,153
…and put on their coats.

920
01:28:15,322 --> 01:28:18,587
-Whose hair are you cutting, then?
-I already have mine.

921
01:28:18,759 --> 01:28:21,956
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

922
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:24,290
l took this out of her clothes.

923
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:27,059
I'm going to see
in the Polyjuice Potion.

924
01:28:27,234 --> 01:28:29,964
Note that Crabbe and Goyle
look for this.

925
01:28:42,082 --> 01:28:44,448
Ron, maybe I should.

926
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:46,677
Whether. Right.

927
01:28:48,889 --> 01:28:50,254
Wingardium Leviosa.

928
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:02,495
Cool.

929
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:27,457
How wide could you get?

930
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:29,596
Come on, let's get them.

931
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:46,971
Well, did you get the hair?

932
01:29:48,411 --> 01:29:50,131
-What is that?
-Slytherin robes.

933
01:29:50,331 --> 01:29:52,971
l had to steal them from the cleaners.

934
01:29:55,331 --> 01:29:56,851
Are we going to drink that?

935
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:01,251
We will have the same hour
before turning into ourselves.

936
01:30:14,945 --> 01:30:16,913
Add the hairs.

937
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:23,180
Essence of Crabbe.

938
01:30:23,353 --> 01:30:25,253
Cheers.

939
01:30:33,964 --> 01:30:36,398
I think I’m going to get sick.

940
01:30:39,302 --> 01:30:41,133
Me too.

941
01:31:26,016 --> 01:31:27,745
Harry?

942
01:31:28,218 --> 01:31:29,776
Ron.

943
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,681
Bloody hell!

944
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:35,754
We still sound like us.

945
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:37,688
You must sound like Crabbe.

946
01:31:38,862 --> 01:31:41,160
-Bloody hell.
-Excellent.

947
01:31:41,498 --> 01:31:43,989
-But where is Hermione?
-l….

948
01:31:44,167 --> 01:31:47,159
I don’t think I’ll go.
You’re leaving without me.

949
01:31:47,337 --> 01:31:49,032
Hermione, are you okay?

950
01:31:49,205 --> 01:31:52,038
Just go. You’re just wasting your time.

951
01:31:54,110 --> 01:31:55,771
Come on.

952
01:31:59,282 --> 01:32:02,649
i think the Slytherin common room
this way.

953
01:32:05,622 --> 01:32:08,090
Excuse me.

954
01:32:09,893 --> 01:32:11,827
What are you d-- doing?

955
01:32:11,995 --> 01:32:14,054
I mean, what are you doing down here?

956
01:32:15,965 --> 01:32:18,695
i am a teacher trainee.

957
01:32:18,868 --> 01:32:23,328
You, on the other hand, have no
walking the halls at night.

958
01:32:23,907 --> 01:32:25,738
What are your names again?

959
01:32:25,909 --> 01:32:29,902
-is….
-Crabbe, Goyle, where have you guys been?

960
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,106
You play in the big room
all this time?

961
01:32:34,617 --> 01:32:36,915
Why are you wearing glasses?

962
01:32:37,754 --> 01:32:40,587
-Reading.
-Reading?

963
01:32:41,758 --> 01:32:44,056
I didn’t know you could read.

964
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:49,023
And what are you doing down here?
Weasley?

965
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,224
Mind your own mind, Malfoy.

966
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:02,000
Okay, sit down.

967
01:33:04,814 --> 01:33:08,648
You would never know the Weasleys
they were pure blood, the way they behave.

968
01:33:08,885 --> 01:33:12,719
They are a disgrace
in the wizarding world. All of them.

969
01:33:13,556 --> 01:33:15,820
“What’s the matter with you, Crabbe?”

970
01:33:18,061 --> 01:33:19,790
Abdominal pain.

971
01:33:21,798 --> 01:33:26,633
You know, I’m fascinated by the Daily Prophet
does not make a comprehensive account of these struggles.

972
01:33:26,803 --> 01:33:29,271
i think Dumbledore
he wants to suppress everything.

973
01:33:29,539 --> 01:33:31,939
My father always said Dumbledore
it was the worst…

974
01:33:32,108 --> 01:33:35,908
-...that ever happened in this country.
-That's not true!

975
01:33:43,386 --> 01:33:44,580
What is?

976
01:33:44,754 --> 01:33:48,417
You think there’s someone here
who is more evil than Dumbledore?

977
01:33:48,591 --> 01:33:50,991
Good? You?

978
01:33:51,528 --> 01:33:53,393
Harry Potter?

979
01:33:59,969 --> 01:34:01,368
Well said, Goyle.

980
01:34:01,538 --> 01:34:03,096
You're absolutely right.

981
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:05,605
Holy Potter.

982
01:34:06,609 --> 01:34:09,373
And people really think
that he is the Heir of Slytherin?

983
01:34:13,149 --> 01:34:15,743
But then you have to have some ideas
who is behind it all.

984
01:34:15,919 --> 01:34:19,616
You know I don’t know, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

985
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:23,115
How many times do I have to tell you?

986
01:34:24,093 --> 01:34:25,958
Is this yours?

987
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,800
But my father said this:

988
01:34:33,169 --> 01:34:36,070
it’s been 50 years
for the Chamber was opened.

989
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:40,642
He wouldn’t tell me who opened it.
Just because they were fired.

990
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:45,574
The Last Days The Chamber of Secrets
opened, a Mudblood died.

991
01:34:45,748 --> 01:34:50,048
So it’s only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

992
01:34:50,653 --> 01:34:52,484
Thus...

993
01:34:52,655 --> 01:34:54,816
… I hope it’s Granger.

994
01:34:54,991 --> 01:34:57,186
What has happened to you two?

995
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,851
You become very stupid.

996
01:35:00,029 --> 01:35:02,224
it’s his stomach.

997
01:35:02,398 --> 01:35:04,457
Sit down.

998
01:35:08,638 --> 01:35:10,629
Scar.

999
01:35:14,244 --> 01:35:15,677
Hair.

1000
01:35:21,851 --> 01:35:24,217
Hey! Where are you going?

1001
01:35:46,823 --> 01:35:48,085
That was close enough.

1002
01:35:48,258 --> 01:35:50,692
Hermione, wake up.
We have a lot to tell you.

1003
01:35:50,861 --> 01:35:52,726
Go away.

1004
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:57,132
Wait till you see. it’s so bad.

1005
01:35:59,069 --> 01:36:00,832
Hermione?

1006
01:36:01,004 --> 01:36:02,631
Are you okay?

1007
01:36:04,674 --> 01:36:06,437
Remember when I told you...

1008
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:09,773
... of the Polyjuice Potion
was it just for people to change?

1009
01:36:09,946 --> 01:36:14,076
It was the head of a dog I took out
Dressed by Millicent Bulstrode.

1010
01:36:16,453 --> 01:36:18,011
Look at my face.

1011
01:36:19,155 --> 01:36:21,589
Look at your skin.

1012
01:36:28,164 --> 01:36:29,597
Have you talked to Hermione?

1013
01:36:29,766 --> 01:36:32,326
He needs to get out of the hospital
in a few days...

1014
01:36:32,502 --> 01:36:35,300
…when he stops playing with pills.

1015
01:3 6:40,076 --> 01:36:41,839
What is this?

1016
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:47,474
Yuck!

1017
01:36:47,651 --> 01:36:50,449
Moaning Myrtle's work
filled the bathroom.

1018
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:10,800
-You come to throw me something else?
-Why would I throw something at you?

1019
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:15,302
Don't ask me. Here I am,
doing my job...

1020
01:37:15,478 --> 01:37:19,107
…and someone thinks it’s cute
to throw a book at me.

1021
01:37:19,316 --> 01:37:22,217
But it can’t hurt if someone
throws something at you.

1022
01:37:22,385 --> 01:37:24,785
I mean, it’s just going
right with you.

1023
01:37:25,822 --> 01:37:30,225
Sure! Let’s all throw books at Myrtle
because he cannot feel it.

1024
01:37:30,393 --> 01:37:32,987
Ten points
if you pass it through his body!

1025
01:37:33,163 --> 01:37:36,655
Fifty points if it goes over his head!

1026
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:41,604
"But who threw you, anyway?"
-I don't know. I didn’t see them.

1027
01:37:41,938 --> 01:37:46,170
I was just sitting on the U-bend,
thinking about death...

1028
01:37:46,376 --> 01:37:50,073
…and fell on top
from my head.

1029
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:11,211
There is a name in this book.

1030
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:15,811
Tom Marvolo Riddle.

1031
01:38:15,971 --> 01:38:17,851
Tom Marvolo Riddle?

1032
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:24,851
Wait. I know the name.
Why do I know that name?

1033
01:38:25,331 --> 01:38:28,411
Of course. That night I got locked up.

1034
01:38:28,571 --> 01:38:31,731
My job was to clean the silver
in the trophy room.

1035
01:38:31,891 --> 01:38:36,811
I remember because I used to laugh all the time
playing on the Tom Riddle trophy.

1036
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:41,331
-What was the trophy?
-He won a prize. 50 years ago.

1037
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:44,091
Special resources for the
school or something.

1038
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:47,411
-50 years ago. Do you really know?
-Whether. Why?

1039
01:38:48,051 --> 01:38:50,051
You don’t remember
what did Malfoy tell you?

1040
01:38:50,211 --> 01:38:51,691
The last day
the open house was--

1041
01:38:51,851 --> 01:38:53,851
It’s been five years.
But that means--

1042
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:57,531
Tom Riddle was here at Hogwarts
when it happened.

1043
01:38:57,731 --> 01:39:00,251
What if he wrote down what he saw?

1044
01:39:00,571 --> 01:39:02,491
maybe he knew
where was the house...

1045
01:39:03,051 --> 01:39:06,931
…how to open it, no matter what
what animal lives in it.

1046
01:39:07,811 --> 01:39:12,611
if so, who is behind this attack
wouldn't want this letter to go away...

1047
01:39:12,771 --> 01:39:13,811
...would they?

1048
01:39:14,211 --> 01:39:18,171
That’s a good theory, Hermione,
but there is only one drawback.

1049
01:39:18,891 --> 01:39:21,611
Nothing is written on this page.

1050
01:39:41,246 --> 01:39:43,046
Are you worried?

1051
01:39:50,957 --> 01:39:53,448
''Tom Marvolo Riddle.''

1052
01:40:22,885 --> 01:40:25,217
My name...

1053
01:40:25,388 --> 01:40:28,323
…it’s Harry…

1054
01:40:29,926 --> 01:40:32,053
...Potter.

1055
01:40:45,308 --> 01:40:50,473
You know what...

1056
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:57,981
...from the Chamber of Secrets?

1057
01:41:08,097 --> 01:41:10,031
Try...

1058
01:41:11,267 --> 01:41:13,565
...tell me?

1059
01:42:15,832 --> 01:42:19,268
Excuse me. Can you tell me
what's going on here?

1060
01:42:22,705 --> 01:42:25,037
Are you Tom Riddle?

1061
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:27,005
Okay, can you hear me?

1062
01:42:47,597 --> 01:42:49,326
Riddle!

1063
01:42:49,932 --> 01:42:51,456
Come.

1064
01:42:51,634 --> 01:42:53,625
Professor Dumbledore.

1065
01:42:55,805 --> 01:42:57,966
Dumbledore?

1066
01:42:59,275 --> 01:43:02,733
It would be unwise to behave
tonight, Tom.

1067
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:06,245
Yes, Master. l think l….

1068
01:43:06,415 --> 01:43:08,610
I had to see for myself
if the rumor was true.

1069
01:43:09,185 --> 01:43:12,086
I’m afraid for them, Tom.
They are real.

1070
01:43:12,255 --> 01:43:15,122
What about the school too?
I have no home to go to.

1071
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:18,124
They won’t actually close Hogwarts,
would they, sir?

1072
01:43:18,294 --> 01:43:20,819
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

1073
01:43:21,597 --> 01:43:24,532
…Professor Dippet
it may have nothing to do with it.

1074
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:29,194
Sir, if it were all over,
if the culprit is caught….

1075
01:43:31,474 --> 01:43:33,567
there's something...

1076
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:36,501
...you mean to tell me?

1077
01:43:37,713 --> 01:43:40,238
No, sir. Nothing.

1078
01:43:47,023 --> 01:43:50,049
Pretty good, then. Go away.

1079
01:43:50,226 --> 01:43:52,091
Good evening, sir.

1080
01:44:28,230 --> 01:44:31,131
-Let's get you out of there.
-Night, Hagrid.

1081
01:44:31,467 --> 01:44:35,801
I have to give it to you, Hagrid.
I don’t think you meant to kill anyone….

1082
01:44:35,972 --> 01:44:38,270
I can't. You don't understand.

1083
01:44:38,441 --> 01:44:41,569
The parents of the dead girl will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do…

1084
01:44:41,744 --> 01:44:44,645
... is do what killed
their daughter is murdered.

1085
01:44:44,914 --> 01:44:48,042
it wasn’t him.
Aragog never killed anyone. Never.

1086
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:50,512
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

1087
01:44:50,686 --> 01:44:52,313
-Now, stand aside.
-No!

1088
01:44:52,488 --> 01:44:54,456
-Stand aside, Hagrid.
-No!

1089
01:44:54,624 --> 01:44:56,251
Aperio system!

1090
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:05,565
Arania Exumai!

1091
01:45:06,435 --> 01:45:07,902
Aragog!

1092
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:09,298
Aragog!

1093
01:45:09,839 --> 01:45:11,238
I can’t let you go.

1094
01:45:11,774 --> 01:45:15,073
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You will be fired.

1095
01:45:17,613 --> 01:45:19,478
Hagrid!

1096
01:45:47,921 --> 01:45:51,081
Ron. Ron, wake up.

1097
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:54,401
What happened?

1098
01:45:54,561 --> 01:45:58,561
it was Hagrid. Hagrid dusted
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

1099
01:46:13,566 --> 01:46:16,535
it can’t be Hagrid.
it cannot be.

1100
01:46:16,702 --> 01:46:20,763
We don’t know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a garbage lover to me.

1101
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:24,432
The monster had killed someone, Ron.
What would any of us do?

1102
01:46:24,744 --> 01:46:28,703
Look, Hagrid is our friend. Why not
are we just going to ask about it?

1103
01:46:28,915 --> 01:46:31,577
That would be fun.
''Well done, Hagrid.

1104
01:46:31,751 --> 01:46:35,585
Let us know, do you have anything installed
Crazy and loose hair in the castle right now?''

1105
01:46:35,755 --> 01:46:38,952
Crazy and hairy? You wouldn’t talk
of me, now, would you?

1106
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:40,281
No.

1107
01:46:44,797 --> 01:46:46,424
What have you got, Hagrid?

1108
01:46:46,866 --> 01:46:51,428
t's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

1109
01:46:51,604 --> 01:46:55,267
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they still have some growing to do.

1110
01:46:55,441 --> 01:46:58,933
But once their acne clears up, we will
you can chop them up and throw them away…

1111
01:46:59,111 --> 01:47:02,410
…and then we’ll catch up with the people
downstairs in the un-Petrified hospital.

1112
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:06,751
In the meantime, though, the three of you…

1113
01:47:06,919 --> 01:47:10,082
...you better take care of yourselves.
All right?

1114
01:47:17,964 --> 01:47:19,864
Good luck, Neville.

1115
01:47:20,967 --> 01:47:23,458
Harry, I don’t know who did it,
but you better come.

1116
01:47:23,836 --> 01:47:25,531
Come on!

1117
01:47:48,094 --> 01:47:52,121
he had to be a Gryffindor.
No one knows our language.

1118
01:47:52,298 --> 01:47:54,528
Unless he was a student.

1119
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:58,136
Whoever it was, they had to have
looking for something.

1120
01:47:58,304 --> 01:47:59,703
And they found it.

1121
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:02,964
Tom Riddle’s book is finished.

1122
01:48:04,003 --> 01:48:05,300
All right, listen up.

1123
01:48:05,471 --> 01:48:08,372
We play,
Hufflepuff doesn’t stand a chance.

1124
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:10,405
We are stronger, more mobile and smarter.

1125
01:48:10,576 --> 01:48:13,602
Needless to say they are terrified
that Harry will hurt them...

1126
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:17,237
-...if they fly anywhere near it.
-Well, that too.

1127
01:48:18,484 --> 01:48:20,008
Professor McGonagall.

1128
01:48:20,185 --> 01:48:23,211
-This battle is over.
-You can't play Quidditch.

1129
01:48:23,389 --> 01:48:28,349
Stop, tree. You and your friends
going to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1130
01:48:28,527 --> 01:48:31,189
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1131
01:48:31,563 --> 01:48:34,088
There is something
you guys need to see it.

1132
01:48:36,201 --> 01:48:39,796
I will advise you.
This can be a little intimidating.

1133
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:49,374
Hermione!

1134
01:48:49,548 --> 01:48:51,345
Spotted near the library...

1135
01:48:52,584 --> 01:48:54,643
...it's just you.

1136
01:48:56,088 --> 01:48:58,921
What does it mean to either of you?

1137
01:48:59,091 --> 01:49:00,558
No.

1138
01:49:14,773 --> 01:49:17,105
Can I have your attention, please?

1139
01:49:17,276 --> 01:49:22,908
Due to the circumstances, this new policy
will start working immediately:

1140
01:49:23,248 --> 01:49:28,379
''All the students will go home
meeting room at 6:00 every afternoon.

1141
01:49:28,554 --> 01:49:32,615
All students will be taken
in each class of a teacher.

1142
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:35,783
There are no exceptions.''

1143
01:49:36,462 --> 01:49:38,521
I have to tell you this:

1144
01:49:38,697 --> 01:49:42,793
Unless the culprit
behind this struggle is...

1145
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:46,531
…maybe the school will be closed.

1146
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,985
We need to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can’t believe it’s him…

1147
01:50:01,153 --> 01:50:03,451
…but if she let go of the monster
deadline...

1148
01:50:03,622 --> 01:50:06,785
...he'll know how to get in
the Chamber of Secrets. That’s a start.

1149
01:50:06,959 --> 01:50:08,187
But you heard McGonagall.

1150
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,659
We are not allowed to leave
the tower is for educational purposes only.

1151
01:50:12,131 --> 01:50:14,599
i think its time to get
my father’s old clothes were reissued.

1152
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,740
Smart?

1153
01:50:46,213 --> 01:50:47,942
Who's there?

1154
01:50:51,752 --> 01:50:53,310
Hello?

1155
01:50:53,954 --> 01:50:55,478
Hello?

1156
01:50:56,657 --> 01:51:00,957
-What is that?
-Nothing. I was waiting….

1157
01:51:01,128 --> 01:51:04,996
it doesn’t matter. Enter.
I just made a pot of tea.

1158
01:51:07,735 --> 01:51:10,033
Hagrid, are you okay?

1159
01:51:10,204 --> 01:51:13,105
I’m fine. I’m fine.

1160
01:51:14,041 --> 01:51:15,770
Have you heard of Hermione?

1161
01:51:16,277 --> 01:51:19,906
Whether. I heard about it, good.

1162
01:51:20,281 --> 01:51:23,910
Look, we need to ask you something.

1163
01:51:25,619 --> 01:51:29,111
Do you know who opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1164
01:51:31,425 --> 01:51:33,723
What you needed to understand
what that is--

1165
01:51:35,396 --> 01:51:36,988
Right away, under the clothes.

1166
01:51:37,665 --> 01:51:40,725
Don't say a word.
Shut up, both of you.

1167
01:51:47,174 --> 01:51:50,234
-Professor Dumbledore, my lord.
-Good evening, Hagrid.

1168
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:52,845
i wonder, maybe...?

1169
01:51:53,013 --> 01:51:55,504
Of course. Enter. Enter.

1170
01:51:55,683 --> 01:51:57,048
It’s my father’s master.

1171
01:51:57,218 --> 01:52:00,779
Cornelius Fudge, minister of magic.

1172
01:52:00,955 --> 01:52:05,358
Bad work, Hagrid, very bad work.
He had to come.

1173
01:52:05,526 --> 01:52:08,757
Three shots at Muggle-borns.
Everything is so far gone.

1174
01:52:08,929 --> 01:52:12,160
-The Ministry should do it.
-But never--

1175
01:52:12,366 --> 01:52:14,129
You know never, Master.

1176
01:52:14,301 --> 01:52:17,395
I hope they understand, Cornelius…

1177
01:52:17,571 --> 01:52:19,402
...from Hagrid...

1178
01:52:19,573 --> 01:52:21,871
… has my full trust.

1179
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:25,842
Albus, look,
Hagrid's book is in front of him.

1180
01:52:26,013 --> 01:52:28,538
- I have to get it.
-Did you take us?

1181
01:52:28,716 --> 01:52:31,014
Where are you taking us?
Not Azkaban Prison.

1182
01:52:31,285 --> 01:52:35,051
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1183
01:52:35,689 --> 01:52:37,589
Are you there, Fudge?

1184
01:52:37,758 --> 01:52:39,089
Good.

1185
01:52:39,994 --> 01:52:42,758
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1186
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:44,954
Trust me...

1187
01:52:45,266 --> 01:52:49,464
…not enjoying anything
what’s inside your….

1188
01:52:51,338 --> 01:52:53,568
You call this a home?

1189
01:52:54,642 --> 01:52:55,666
No.

1190
01:52:55,843 --> 01:52:59,745
I just called the school
and they told him the teacher was here.

1191
01:52:59,913 --> 01:53:03,974
Well, what exactly is
what do you want with me?

1192
01:53:04,551 --> 01:53:09,284
The other governors and I have agreed
it’s time to say goodbye.

1193
01:53:10,924 --> 01:53:13,825
This is a rule of thumb.

1194
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,767
You will find all 1 2 signatures on it.

1195
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:30,838
I’m afraid we feel
you’re better off losing weight.

1196
01:53:31,578 --> 01:53:33,910
Well, what, with all this competition…

1197
01:53:34,081 --> 01:53:36,845
...there will be no
Muggle-borns stayed at Hogwarts.

1198
01:53:37,017 --> 01:53:41,579
I can only imagine something worse
that will be in the school.

1199
01:53:41,755 --> 01:53:43,950
You cannot take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1200
01:53:44,224 --> 01:53:46,784
Remove it and the Muggle-borns
won’t have a chance.

1201
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,428
You see my words,
then there will be murder!

1202
01:53:49,596 --> 01:53:51,223
How do you think?

1203
01:53:51,398 --> 01:53:53,923
Calm down, Hagrid.

1204
01:53:55,269 --> 01:53:57,999
If the governors want to get rid of me….

1205
01:53:58,172 --> 01:54:01,869
…I will, of course, stand aside.

1206
01:54:03,954 --> 01:54:06,184
Though...

1207
01:54:06,857 --> 01:54:11,385
…you’ll find the benefit
will always be offered at Hogwarts…

1208
01:54:11,562 --> 01:54:13,462
...why...

1209
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:15,962
...ask him.

1210
01:54:22,773 --> 01:54:25,105
Good sense.

1211
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,072
Shall we do it?

1212
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:40,713
Fudge.

1213
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:44,290
Come on, Hagrid.

1214
01:54:45,395 --> 01:54:46,953
Good?

1215
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:48,689
lf….

1216
01:54:49,099 --> 01:54:51,659
If anyone was looking for something...

1217
01:54:51,835 --> 01:54:56,704
…after all they had to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1218
01:54:56,874 --> 01:54:59,468
When. That would lead them right.

1219
01:54:59,643 --> 01:55:01,577
That's all I have to say.

1220
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:07,044
And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1221
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:12,411
Good boy.

1222
01:55:18,562 --> 01:55:20,689
Hagrid is right.

1223
01:55:20,864 --> 01:55:23,799
When Dumbledore left,
there will be a fight someday.

1224
01:55:23,967 --> 01:55:25,628
Look.

1225
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:33,505
Come on.

1226
01:55:37,214 --> 01:55:39,239
Come on, Fang.

1227
01:55:57,534 --> 01:55:58,899
Come on.

1228
01:55:59,069 --> 01:56:00,366
What is?

1229
01:56:00,537 --> 01:56:03,768
You heard Hagrid say.
''Follow the spiders.''

1230
01:56:03,941 --> 01:56:06,569
They head towards the Night Forest.

1231
01:56:08,612 --> 01:56:13,072
Why spiders? Why couldn’t he
''follow the butterflies''?

1232
01:57:27,269 --> 01:57:30,033
Harry, I don’t like this.

1233
01:57:35,143 --> 01:57:38,340
-Harry, I don't like this.
-Stop!

1234
01:57:49,891 --> 01:57:52,416
Can we go back now?

1235
01:57:52,594 --> 01:57:54,323
Come on.

1236
01:58:44,045 --> 01:58:46,809
Who is he?

1237
01:58:47,482 --> 01:58:48,574
Don't be afraid.

1238
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:50,440
Hagrid?

1239
01:58:50,852 --> 01:58:52,444
ls about you?

1240
01:58:53,021 --> 01:58:54,955
We’re friends with Hagrid.

1241
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:16,238
And you?
You’re Aragog, aren’t you?

1242
01:59:16,878 --> 01:59:18,175
Whether.

1243
01:59:18,346 --> 01:59:22,112
Hagrid never sent
men in our pit before.

1244
01:59:22,284 --> 01:59:25,412
He's in trouble. At the school,
there is competition.

1245
01:59:26,054 --> 01:59:27,919
They think it’s Hagrid.

1246
01:59:28,156 --> 01:59:31,751
It is believed that he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like the first one.

1247
01:59:31,993 --> 01:59:34,291
That's a lie.

1248
01:59:34,796 --> 01:59:37,731
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1249
01:59:38,366 --> 01:59:41,233
-Then you're not the monster?
-No.

1250
01:59:41,403 --> 01:59:44,429
The monster was born in the castle.

1251
01:59:44,673 --> 01:59:49,940
I came to Hagrid from afar
in a passenger’s pocket.

1252
01:59:50,545 --> 01:59:52,172
Harry.

1253
01:59:54,082 --> 01:59:58,644
But if you’re not the monster, then
What killed that girl 50 years ago?

1254
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:01,812
We don’t talk about it.

1255
02:00:02,157 --> 02:00:07,720
is an ancient beast
spiders are afraid of everyone else.

1256
02:00:07,896 --> 02:00:09,659
But have you seen it?

1257
02:00:10,332 --> 02:00:16,168
never saw any part of the castle
but the tree where Hagrid had me.

1258
02:00:16,338 --> 02:00:19,501
The girl was identified
in a bathroom.

1259
02:00:19,674 --> 02:00:24,168
When I was convicted,
Hagrid brought me here.

1260
02:00:24,346 --> 02:00:26,371
-Harry!
-What is?

1261
02:00:39,227 --> 02:00:42,219
Well, thank you.

1262
02:00:43,164 --> 02:00:45,325
We'll just go.

1263
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:47,563
Go?

1264
02:00:47,736 --> 02:00:49,499
I don’t think so.

1265
02:00:49,671 --> 02:00:55,132
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my orders.

1266
02:00:55,310 --> 02:00:57,710
But I can’t blame them
fresh meat...

1267
02:00:57,879 --> 02:01:02,213
...while walking
so he willingly steps inside.

1268
02:01:02,417 --> 02:01:06,183
Farewell, Friend Hagrid.

1269
02:01:06,354 --> 02:01:08,185
Can we be afraid now?

1270
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:20,834
Do you know any words?

1271
02:01:21,002 --> 02:01:24,165
One, but not powerful
enough for all of them.

1272
02:01:24,339 --> 02:01:27,069
Where is Hermione when you need her?

1273
02:01:40,588 --> 02:01:41,885
Let's go!

1274
02:01:47,028 --> 02:01:49,087
Arania Exumai!

1275
02:01:54,402 --> 02:01:55,733
Go!

1276
02:02:13,722 --> 02:02:15,781
I’m glad we got out of there.

1277
02:02:22,764 --> 02:02:25,096
Arania Exumai!

1278
02:02:30,805 --> 02:02:34,571
-Thank you for that.
-Don't say it.

1279
02:02:45,487 --> 02:02:47,648
Get us out of here.

1280
02:02:48,156 --> 02:02:49,851
Now!

1281
02:02:51,926 --> 02:02:56,158
Come on!
Come on, walk faster!

1282
02:02:58,867 --> 02:03:00,198
Come on! Go!

1283
02:03:17,607 --> 02:03:19,666
Put me in the air.

1284
02:03:20,744 --> 02:03:22,211
The propeller is completely jammed!

1285
02:03:26,316 --> 02:03:30,082
-Come on! Pull!
-I'm trying!

1286
02:03:59,416 --> 02:04:02,351
Follow the dogs.
Follow the dogs.

1287
02:04:02,519 --> 02:04:06,853
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I will kill him.

1288
02:04:20,837 --> 02:04:24,068
I mean, what was the point
that will send us there?

1289
02:04:24,241 --> 02:04:28,837
-What have we found?
-We know something.

1290
02:04:29,012 --> 02:04:32,413
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1291
02:04:32,616 --> 02:04:34,607
He had done nothing wrong.

1292
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:52,568
I wish you were here, Hermione.

1293
02:04:53,103 --> 02:04:55,367
We need you.

1294
02:04:56,306 --> 02:04:58,399
Now more than ever.

1295
02:05:15,325 --> 02:05:18,726
-What is that?
-Ron….

1296
02:05:19,563 --> 02:05:24,023
So Hermione was in
the library at the time of the attack.

1297
02:05:24,568 --> 02:05:25,830
Come on.

1298
02:05:26,503 --> 02:05:29,472
''Of the many terrifying creatures
traveling our country...

1299
02:05:29,639 --> 02:05:34,269
…none more deadly than the basilisk.
It can last for years...

1300
02:05:34,444 --> 02:05:38,210
…sudden death awaits those who face it
this big snake eye.

1301
02:05:38,381 --> 02:05:41,373
The spiders are running ahead.''
Ron, this is it.

1302
02:05:41,551 --> 02:05:44,349
The monster in the room
hidden is a basilisk.

1303
02:05:44,521 --> 02:05:48,457
That’s why I hear him talk.
it’s a snake.

1304
02:05:48,792 --> 02:05:54,059
But if he dreams of dreaming people
in his eyes, why didn’t anyone die?

1305
02:06:04,708 --> 02:06:07,609
Because no one see
in his eyes.

1306
02:06:09,579 --> 02:06:12,173
Not really, though.

1307
02:06:13,416 --> 02:06:15,646
Colin watched with his camera.

1308
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:19,846
Justin-- Justin had to see
the basilisk with Nearly Headless Nick.

1309
02:06:20,023 --> 02:06:24,016
Nick got all the spotlight.
But he was a monster, he couldn't die again.

1310
02:06:24,194 --> 02:06:27,322
And Hermione had the mirror.

1311
02:06:27,497 --> 02:06:30,864
i think he was using it to see
around corners if it comes.

1312
02:06:31,034 --> 02:06:32,296
And Mrs. Norris?

1313
02:06:32,469 --> 02:06:35,961
I’m pretty sure he didn’t have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1314
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:39,405
The water.

1315
02:06:39,876 --> 02:06:45,439
There was water on the ground that night.
He only saw the shadow of the basilisk.

1316
02:06:51,588 --> 02:06:53,522
''The spiders run away from him.''

1317
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:57,421
-lt is all right.
-But how does a basilisk move?

1318
02:06:57,594 --> 02:07:00,427
A dirty, big snake.
Someone would notice.

1319
02:07:00,664 --> 02:07:06,261
-Hermione answered that too.
-Ransom? we use the plumbing.

1320
02:07:06,436 --> 02:07:10,702
Remember what Aragog said
from that girl 50 years ago?

1321
02:07:10,874 --> 02:07:15,106
Did he die in a toilet?
What if he never left?

1322
02:07:15,779 --> 02:07:17,110
Myrtle exclaims.

1323
02:07:18,081 --> 02:07:22,108
All students must return
in their bedrooms at once.

1324
02:07:22,285 --> 02:07:25,721
All students on the second floor
hallway quickly.

1325
02:07:30,727 --> 02:07:36,563
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
left another message.

1326
02:07:36,733 --> 02:07:38,928
Our greatest fear has been realized.

1327
02:07:39,102 --> 02:07:43,664
A student brought the dog
in the building itself.

1328
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:50,407
Students should be sent home.
I’m afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1329
02:07:52,782 --> 02:07:55,216
Sorry. I slept.
What have I missed?

1330
02:07:55,385 --> 02:07:59,754
A girl has stolen the monster,
Lockhart. The time has come.

1331
02:07:59,923 --> 02:08:02,858
-The weather?
-You weren't saying that just last night...

1332
02:08:03,026 --> 02:08:07,554
...that you knew all along where
the door to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1333
02:08:08,932 --> 02:08:14,393
It depends. we will leave you
to face the monster, Gilderoy.

1334
02:08: 14,571 --> 02:08:19,770
-Your skills, after all, are legendary.
-Very well.

1335
02:08:19,943 --> 02:08:23,140
I’ll just be in my office getting it….

1336
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,948
Get ready.

1337
02:08:28,852 --> 02:08:32,049
Who is the monster that has caught him?
Minerva?

1338
02:08:32,222 --> 02:08:34,053
Ginny Weasley.

1339
02:08:45,468 --> 02:08:48,528
''His skeleton will lie
in the house forever.''

1340
02:08:52,575 --> 02:08:54,372
Ginny.

1341
02:08:56,446 --> 02:08:59,938
Lockhart may not matter, but he
I’m going to try and get into the room.

1342
02:09:00,116 --> 02:09:02,846
Thus, we can call
that we know.

1343
02:09:04,187 --> 02:09:06,747
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1344
02:09:08,525 --> 02:09:10,493
“Where are you going?”

1345
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:13,754
Well, yes. Quick question. We cannot escape.
I have to go.

1346
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:17,161
-What happened to my sister?
-Good....

1347
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:20,958
Yeah, it’s really bad.
No one cares more than l.

1348
02:09:21,137 --> 02:09:25,130
You are the protection against darkness
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1349
02:09:25,308 --> 02:09:28,300
I have to say, when I got the job,
there was nothing in the message--

1350
02:09:28,478 --> 02:09:29,638
Are you running away?

1351
02:09:29,813 --> 02:09:32,611
-After everything you did on your book?
-Books can be misleading.

1352
02:09:32,782 --> 02:09:35,342
-You wrote them.
-Son, use your common sense.

1353
02:09:35,518 --> 02:09:39,921
My book wouldn’t sell half that
if people didn’t think I was doing that stuff.

1354
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:42,082
You're a liar.

1355
02:09:42,258 --> 02:09:45,056
You have money
because of what other witches have done.

1356
02:09:45,228 --> 02:09:47,162
Is there anything you can do?

1357
02:09:47,330 --> 02:09:52,063
Yes, now you say.
I have been very successful with Memory Charms.

1358
02:09:52,235 --> 02:09:54,726
Otherwise, all the witches
he was going to play.

1359
02:09:54,904 --> 02:09:57,998
I would never sell another book.

1360
02:09:58,174 --> 02:10:03,908
of course, I have to do
same with you.

1361
02:10:04,414 --> 02:10:07,178
Don't even think about it.

1362
02:10:18,061 --> 02:10:19,494
Who's there?

1363
02:10:21,931 --> 02:10:23,956
Good luck, Harry.

1364
02:10:24,901 --> 02:10:30,066
-What do you want?
-To ask you how you died.

1365
02:10:32,442 --> 02:10:34,876
it was terrifying.

1366
02:10:35,044 --> 02:10:38,741
click here
in this room.

1367
02:10:38,915 --> 02:10:42,942
hiding because of Olive Hornby
teasing me with my glasses.

1368
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:48,022
l cried, and then
I heard someone enter.

1369
02:10:48,191 --> 02:10:54,528
-Who was it, Myrtle?
-I don't know. I was so confused!

1370
02:10:55,832 --> 02:10:59,233
But they said something stupid.
a kind of artificial language.

1371
02:10:59,402 --> 02:11:05,739
And I realized it was a boy, so I opened
the door to say goodbye and...

1372
02:11:06,943 --> 02:11:11,778
-...I'm dead.
-Just like that? How?

1373
02:11:11,948 --> 02:11:16,442
I only remember seeing a couple
those big, big, brown eyes...

1374
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:20,453
… there by the sink.

1375
02:11:45,548 --> 02:11:47,573
Appropriate.

1376
02:11:48,484 --> 02:11:53,285
Here it is, Ron. I think this
the entrance to the storage room.

1377
02:11:55,291 --> 02:12:00,160
Say something. Harry,
declare something in terms of parcel.

1378
02:12:51,681 --> 02:12:55,777
All right, Harry. Good job.
Well, then, I’ll just be….

1379
02:12:55,952 --> 02:12:58,216
I don’t have to stay.

1380
02:12:58,821 --> 02:13:00,721
Yes, there is.

1381
02:13:02,525 --> 02:13:05,619
-You first.
-Now, boys, what good will it do?

1382
02:13:05,795 --> 02:13:07,126
You're better than us.

1383
02:13:08,331 --> 02:13:11,266
But-- Actually, yeah.

1384
02:13:15,538 --> 02:13:18,268
Surely you don’t want to try it first?

1385
02:13:25,081 --> 02:13:28,312
it’s really dirty here.

1386
02:13:28,785 --> 02:13:33,313
-All right. Let's go.
-Oh, Harry?

1387
02:13:33,723 --> 02:13:38,660
if you die down there,
you can share my bathroom.

1388
02:13:41,197 --> 02:13:43,165
Thank you, Myrtle.

1389
02:14:12,261 --> 02:14:17,460
Now, remember: All movement signals,
close your eyes straight.

1390
02:14:18,401 --> 02:14:20,062
Go away.

1391
02:14:23,773 --> 02:14:25,104
This way.

1392
02:14:32,148 --> 02:14:37,381
-What is this?
-lt looks like a snake.

1393
02:14:37,553 --> 02:14:41,216
-is a snake skin.
-Bloody hell.

1394
02:14:41,391 --> 02:14:47,193
Whichever of these should be
60 meters long. Or more.

1395
02:14:49,098 --> 02:14:52,067
Heart of a lion, this.

1396
02:14:55,772 --> 02:15:00,436
The game ends here, boys.
But don't worry.

1397
02:15:02,378 --> 02:15:07,839
The whole world will know our story.
That’s how long it took me to save that girl.

1398
02:15:08,184 --> 02:15:11,676
How are you guys
you sadly lost your mind...

1399
02:15:11,854 --> 02:15:14,823
...when he saw her mangled body.

1400
02:15:15,691 --> 02:15:17,124
So....

1401
02:15:18,261 --> 02:15:20,593
You first, Mr. Potter.

1402
02:15:20,830 --> 02:15:23,993
Be clear about your skills.

1403
02:15:26,068 --> 02:15:28,002
Forget it!

1404
02:16:01,938 --> 02:16:05,066
-Ron! Ron, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1405
02:16:08,811 --> 02:16:10,574
Hello.

1406
02:16:11,247 --> 02:16:13,078
Who are you?

1407
02:16:14,450 --> 02:16:17,112
-Ron Weasley.
-Really?

1408
02:16:17,286 --> 02:16:20,153
And who am I?

1409
02:16:21,924 --> 02:16:26,224
Lockhart's Memory Charm failed.
He doesn’t know who he is.

1410
02:16:26,562 --> 02:16:31,056
it’s kind of weird, isn’t it?

1411
02:16:31,234 --> 02:16:33,361
Are you here?

1412
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:36,595
-No.
-Really?

1413
02:16:41,177 --> 02:16:42,974
-What do I do now?
-Wait here...

1414
02:16:43,145 --> 02:16:46,080
…and try to move some of this stone
so we can go back.

1415
02:16:46,249 --> 02:16:49,912
-i'll go and find Ginny.
-Good.

1416
02:18:23,145 --> 02:18:27,013
Ginny! Ginny, don't die.
Wake up, wake up.

1417
02:18:27,516 --> 02:18:29,609
Wake up.

1418
02:18:29,885 --> 02:18:32,012
He won't wake up.

1419
02:18:37,493 --> 02:18:41,827
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won’t wake up?

1420
02:18:41,998 --> 02:18:45,365
-He doesn't...?
-Still alive, but barely.

1421
02:18:46,369 --> 02:18:48,667
-Are you a monster?
-A memory...

1422
02:18:48,838 --> 02:18:51,238
…we’ve kept it in a diary for 50 years.

1423
02:18:53,909 --> 02:18:59,108
He’s cold as ice.
Ginny, don't die. Wake up.

1424
02:18:59,281 --> 02:19:01,681
We need your help, Tom.
There is a basilisk.

1425
02:19:01,851 --> 02:19:04,445
he won’t come until he’s called.

1426
02:19:07,256 --> 02:19:10,054
-Give me my stick, Tom.
-You won't have to.

1427
02:19:11,127 --> 02:19:14,528
-We have to go. We need to save it.
-I'm afraid I can't do that.

1428
02:19:14,697 --> 02:19:18,724
You see, as poor Ginny grows older,
l will grow stronger.

1429
02:19:20,102 --> 02:19:24,596
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
which opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1430
02:19:24,774 --> 02:19:27,106
No. He couldn't. She didn’t want to.

1431
02:19:27,276 --> 02:19:30,473
it was Ginny who planted the basilisk
in the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1432
02:19:30,646 --> 02:19:33,080
…Ginny who wrote the creepy post
words on the wall.

1433
02:19:33,249 --> 02:19:36,548
-But why?
-Because I told him to.

1434
02:19:36,719 --> 02:19:41,679
You will find l can be very motivating.
Not that he knew what he was doing.

1435
02:19:41,857 --> 02:19:45,190
He was, shall we say?
in a certain perspective.

1436
02:19:45,728 --> 02:19:48,219
Furthermore, the strength of the diary
it began to frighten him.

1437
02:19:48,397 --> 02:19:50,763
He tried to destroy
in the girls’ bathroom.

1438
02:19:50,933 --> 02:19:55,302
And then who will find it but you?

1439
02:19:55,471 --> 02:19:58,565
The person
l was eager to get to know myself.

1440
02:19:59,175 --> 02:20:01,234
And why did you want to meet?

1441
02:20:01,644 --> 02:20:05,011
I knew I had to talk to you,
I would meet you if I could.

1442
02:20:05,181 --> 02:20:08,446
So I thought I’d show you what I had
about Hagrid's brainless bastard...

1443
02:20:08,617 --> 02:20:11,780
-...to earn your trust.
-Hagrid my friend.

1444
02:20:12,722 --> 02:20:17,318
-And you cooked it, didn't you?
-lt was my answer to Hagrid.

1445
02:20:17,493 --> 02:20:20,758
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he had done nothing.

1446
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:23,091
I hope Dumbledore saw
right with you.

1447
02:20:23,265 --> 02:20:26,723
He certainly got a horrible punishment
see me after that.

1448
02:20:26,902 --> 02:20:30,201
I knew it would be safe to open the
Chamber back when I was still in school…

1449
02:20:30,372 --> 02:20:32,203
… so I decided to leave
if daily...

1450
02:20:32,374 --> 02:20:34,467
...taking care of my 1 6 year old
in his book...

1451
02:20:34,643 --> 02:20:37,339
…for a day
I could lead another...

1452
02:20:37,513 --> 02:20:40,311
…to the end of Salazar Slytherin
quality work.

1453
02:20:40,483 --> 02:20:42,747
Well, you haven’t finished
this time.

1454
02:20:42,918 --> 02:20:45,887
Within hours, the Mandrake Draft
will be ready.

1455
02:20:46,055 --> 02:20:48,785
And everyone who was Petrified
it will be fine again.

1456
02:20:49,191 --> 02:20:54,424
Didn't I tell you? Chemistry Mudbloods
it doesn’t matter to me anymore.

1457
02:20:54,697 --> 02:20:59,464
For months now,
my new target is you.

1458
02:21:00,936 --> 02:21:04,531
What is it like to be a baby
with not having a high magic skill...

1459
02:21:04,707 --> 02:21:07,369
...managed to defeat the great wizard
of all time?

1460
02:21:07,710 --> 02:21:10,645
How did you get away with nothing
but a bit...

1461
02:21:10,813 --> 02:21:13,213
…while the power of Lord Voldemort
were they destroyed?

1462
02:21:13,382 --> 02:21:17,546
Why do you care how l escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1463
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:24,182
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1464
02:21:44,613 --> 02:21:48,049
You. You belong in Slytherin.

1465
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:54,815
-Take Voldemort.
-You really didn't think...

1466
02:21:54,990 --> 02:21:59,484
…I wanted to keep
my dirty father's Muggle name?

1467
02:21:59,662 --> 02:22:03,826
No. I made myself a new name,
a name I knew witches everywhere…

1468
02:22:03,999 --> 02:22:08,197
…would ever be afraid to speak up when l
he became the greatest wizard in the world.

1469
02:22:08,370 --> 02:22:11,533
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest magician in the world.

1470
02:22:11,707 --> 02:22:15,108
Dumbledore was fired from
this authority only through the knowledge of myself.

1471
02:22:15,277 --> 02:22:20,340
He will never be lost. It's not like
those who remain dependent on it.

1472
02:22:26,755 --> 02:22:27,744
Foxes?

1473
02:22:44,039 --> 02:22:47,600
So this is what Dumbledore
he sends his great guard.

1474
02:22:47,776 --> 02:22:51,473
A songbird and a big hat.

1475
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:09,288
Let’s compare the power of Lord Voldemort,
When Salazar Slytherin...

1476
02:23:09,465 --> 02:23:13,492
…instead of the famous Harry Potter.

1477
02:23:26,815 --> 02:23:31,149
Parseltongue won’t save you now,
Potter. he just listens to me.

1478
02:24:01,350 --> 02:24:02,908
No!

1479
02:24:03,352 --> 02:24:07,846
Your bird may have covered the basilisk,
but he can still hear you.

1480
02:25:49,858 --> 02:25:53,157
Yes, Potter.
The project is nearing completion.

1481
02:25:53,328 --> 02:25:58,231
in a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
he died, and he will no longer be a memory.

1482
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:01,062
Lord Voldemort will return…

1483
02:26:01,437 --> 02:26:05,635
…very much alive.

1484
02:26:06,375 --> 02:26:07,774
Ginny?

1485
02:28:24,112 --> 02:28:25,704
Pretty cool, isn’t it…

1486
02:28:25,881 --> 02:28:29,874
...how quickly the poison
that the basilisk enters his body?

1487
02:28:30,052 --> 02:28:32,714
i think you have a little more
than a minute to live.

1488
02:28:33,055 --> 02:28:37,082
Being with your lover
The trash mother immediately, Harry.

1489
02:28:42,097 --> 02:28:45,760
Well, that pressure is a joke
books books can do...

1490
02:28:45,934 --> 02:28:50,962
...very much in their hands
of a naughty girl.

1491
02:28:53,842 --> 02:28:55,673
What are you doing?

1492
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:00,607
Stop. No!

1493
02:29:58,907 --> 02:30:02,866
it was me.
But I admit, I didn’t mean to.

1494
02:30:03,045 --> 02:30:06,537
Riddle made me, and….

1495
02:30:07,082 --> 02:30:09,710
Harry, you’re in trouble.

1496
02:30:10,085 --> 02:30:11,575
Don't worry.

1497
02:30:11,753 --> 02:30:15,382
Ginny, I need
to get rid of.

1498
02:30:15,557 --> 02:30:18,822
Follow the house
and you’ll find Ron.

1499
02:30:30,972 --> 02:30:33,099
You're so smart, Fawkes.

1500
02:30:34,209 --> 02:30:36,643
just not fast enough.

1501
02:30:57,432 --> 02:30:59,161
Of course.

1502
02:30:59,434 --> 02:31:02,301
Phoenix Tears have healing powers.

1503
02:31:03,905 --> 02:31:05,702
Thank you.

1504
02:31:07,442 --> 02:31:09,569
It’s okay, Ginny.

1505
02:31:10,712 --> 02:31:12,907
it’s over.

1506
02:31:13,915 --> 02:31:16,440
it’s just an idea.

1507
02:31:19,354 --> 02:31:24,690
Amazing!
This is like magic!

1508
02:31:35,971 --> 02:31:38,633
You guys know, of course...

1509
02:31:38,807 --> 02:31:44,302
…that for the past few hours, you’ve had
they broke maybe a dozen school rules.

1510
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:45,969
Yes, sir.

1511
02:31:46,148 --> 02:31:49,379
There is a lot of evidence that
to get you both out.

1512
02:31:49,551 --> 02:31:50,745
Yes, sir.

1513
02:31:50,919 --> 02:31:53,683
So, it’s only fitting…

1514
02:31:55,223 --> 02:31:57,487
…which you guys will get…

1515
02:31:57,993 --> 02:32:02,089
...Extraordinary Payment for Support
at the School.

1516
02:32:04,166 --> 02:32:06,031
Thank you, sir.

1517
02:32:06,601 --> 02:32:08,899
Aman, Mr. Weasley, if you please...

1518
02:32:09,070 --> 02:32:13,234
…get a dog to give you this
take out books in Azkaban.

1519
02:32:14,342 --> 02:32:19,109
I believe we want
our guardian again.

1520
02:32:24,085 --> 02:32:28,419
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1521
02:32:29,057 --> 02:32:32,549
You must have shown me
true loyalty to the Chamber.

1522
02:32:33,428 --> 02:32:37,990
It's nothing but that
he could have called you Fawkes.

1523
02:32:40,402 --> 02:32:41,926
And...

1524
02:32:42,504 --> 02:32:43,937
...second...

1525
02:32:44,105 --> 02:32:48,872
…I feel like something
it worries you.

1526
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:51,601
“Are you okay, Harry?”

1527
02:32:53,448 --> 02:32:55,177
Just….

1528
02:32:56,351 --> 02:33:01,084
You see, sir, I couldn’t help
but look at some things, some….

1529
02:33:01,256 --> 02:33:06,888
Some similarities
between Tom Riddle and myself.

1530
02:33:07,462 --> 02:33:08,656
I saw.

1531
02:33:08,830 --> 02:33:14,632
Well, you can talk
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1532
02:33:15,070 --> 02:33:20,599
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1533
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:24,540
If I’m not mistaken, Harry…

1534
02:33:24,946 --> 02:33:28,780
...he passed
some of his power giving you...

1535
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:31,885
…the night he gave you the slice.

1536
02:33:32,053 --> 02:33:35,955
Voldemort was passed
some of his power over me?

1537
02:33:37,859 --> 02:33:40,555
Not with all my heart...

1538
02:33:41,463 --> 02:33:43,363
...but yeah.

1539
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:48,599
So the Sorting Hat was right.
l must be in Slytherin.

1540
02:33:48,770 --> 02:33:53,605
certain. You have a lot of the
qualities that Voldemort himself admires.

1541
02:33:53,775 --> 02:33:56,642
Consistency, understanding...

1542
02:33:56,811 --> 02:34:00,804
…and if I may say so,
some violation of the law.

1543
02:34:01,483 --> 02:34:05,476
Why, then, the Sweepstakes Hat
will you put him in Gryffindor?

1544
02:34:06,288 --> 02:34:09,985
-Because I asked.
-Yes, Harry. Exactly.

1545
02:34:10,158 --> 02:34:12,217
What makes you different
of Voldemort.

1546
02:34:12,394 --> 02:34:16,262
is not our strength
that reveals what we really are.

1547
02:34:16,565 --> 02:34:18,692
it is our choice.

1548
02:34:22,370 --> 02:34:25,771
if you want a reference
why are you in Gryffindor…

1549
02:34:25,941 --> 02:34:30,810
…then I say
you will take a closer look at this.

1550
02:34:31,813 --> 02:34:33,508
Be careful.

1551
02:34:39,154 --> 02:34:41,816
Godric Gryffindor.

1552
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:46,086
I’ll take a true Gryffindor
to pull it out of the hat.

1553
02:34:54,970 --> 02:34:56,369
Dobby.

1554
02:34:57,639 --> 02:35:02,008
So this is your boss.
The family you’re dealing with is the Malfoys.

1555
02:35:04,212 --> 02:35:07,545
I'll judge you later.

1556
02:35:13,388 --> 02:35:14,980
Stay out of my way, Potter.

1557
02:35:15,156 --> 02:35:18,751
So it's true. You're back.

1558
02:35:19,427 --> 02:35:22,191
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1559
02:35:22,364 --> 02:35:26,562
...brought him into the room,
they saw fit to invite me.

1560
02:35:27,402 --> 02:35:31,463
-Ridiculous.
-Curious, Lucius, some of them...

1561
02:35:31,640 --> 02:35:35,303
...were in the process of testing
that you would be hurting their family…

1562
02:35:35,477 --> 02:35:38,310
…if they weren’t planning
to stop me in the first place.

1563
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:42,238
-How dare you!
-Did you apologize?

1564
02:35:42,417 --> 02:35:46,183
My only concern has always been
and always will be…

1565
02:35:46,354 --> 02:35:49,187
...the quality of life of this school...

1566
02:35:49,357 --> 02:35:53,657
…and, of course, his students.

1567
02:35:57,699 --> 02:36:01,897
The culprit has been identified,
l think?

1568
02:36:02,303 --> 02:36:03,827
Whether.

1569
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:07,271
And?

1570
02:36:08,443 --> 02:36:10,468
Who was it?

1571
02:36:16,885 --> 02:36:19,445
Voldemort.

1572
02:36:20,588 --> 02:36:26,049
Only this time he chose to do
with another...

1573
02:36:26,594 --> 02:36:30,223
...you.

1574
02:36:32,901 --> 02:36:34,425
I saw.

1575
02:36:35,904 --> 02:36:40,102
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
he showed.

1576
02:36:40,475 --> 02:36:44,138
One expects nothing less from God
Old school Voldemort…

1577
02:36:44,312 --> 02:36:47,543
…they have to find their way
in the hands of the innocent.

1578
02:36:47,882 --> 02:36:51,818
The consequences of a
the culprit would be...

1579
02:36:52,187 --> 02:36:54,052
...severe.

1580
02:36:55,457 --> 02:36:58,255
Well, let’s hope…

1581
02:36:58,426 --> 02:37:03,955
...from Mr. Potter will always
stay to save the day.

1582
02:37:04,733 --> 02:37:08,499
Don't worry. l elis.

1583
02:37:17,245 --> 02:37:19,270
Dumbledore.

1584
02:37:20,415 --> 02:37:23,942
Come on, Dobby. We're going out.

1585
02:37:41,236 --> 02:37:45,673
Lord?
wondering if I could have that?

1586
02:37:52,113 --> 02:37:53,705
Mr. Malfoy.

1587
02:37:53,882 --> 02:37:56,077
Mr. Malfoy!

1588
02:37:56,551 --> 02:37:58,712
i have something for you.

1589
02:38:00,388 --> 02:38:03,323
Me? I don't know
what you say.

1590
02:38:03,558 --> 02:38:05,082
i think you do, sir.

1591
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:08,354
i think you missed the diary
in Ginny Weasley's room...

1592
02:38:08,530 --> 02:38:09,963
...that day in Diagon Alley.

1593
02:38:10,665 --> 02:38:13,190
You do, don’t you?

1594
02:38:20,575 --> 02:38:23,635
Why don't you prove it?

1595
02:38:29,884 --> 02:38:32,045
Come on, Dobby.

1596
02:38:33,354 --> 02:38:35,379
Open it.

1597
02:38:38,927 --> 02:38:40,451
Dobby.

1598
02:38:40,628 --> 02:38:43,791
Teacher gave Dobby a sock.

1599
02:38:44,065 --> 02:38:46,158
What is? I didn't give it--

1600
02:38:46,334 --> 02:38:50,031
Teacher introduced Dobby
with clothes.

1601
02:38:50,205 --> 02:38:53,265
Dobby doesn’t pay.

1602
02:38:59,814 --> 02:39:03,545
You have lost my servant!

1603
02:39:10,525 --> 02:39:14,518
You don’t have to underestimate Harry Potter.

1604
02:39:26,674 --> 02:39:30,371
Your parents were
they are also very stupid.

1605
02:39:30,545 --> 02:39:33,708
Mark my words, Potter.
Someday soon...

1606
02:39:33,882 --> 02:39:39,081
…you’re going to meet
the same average size.

1607
02:39:44,792 --> 02:39:50,697
Harry Potter released Dobby.
How can Dobby pay for it?

1608
02:39:51,065 --> 02:39:55,297
-Just suggest something.
-Anything, sir.

1609
02:39:57,272 --> 02:39:59,740
Don't ever try to save my life.

1610
02:40:05,880 --> 02:40:08,872
-Welcome, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1611
02:40:09,183 --> 02:40:11,549
-Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
-Good night.

1612
02:40:11,719 --> 02:40:14,620
-Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1613
02:40:16,024 --> 02:40:18,219
Hello.

1614
02:40:19,928 --> 02:40:24,558
-Hermione! Welcome back.
-Thank you, Sir Nicholas.

1615
02:40:27,802 --> 02:40:31,135
Harry. said Hermione.

1616
02:40:57,966 --> 02:41:01,663
-Welcome, Hermione.
-we'll be back.

1617
02:41:01,836 --> 02:41:04,430
Thank you.
I can’t believe you made it.

1618
02:41:04,605 ​​​ --> 02:41:06,869
We had a lot of help from you.

1619
02:41:07,041 --> 02:41:10,272
-We couldn’t have done it without you guys.
-Thank you.

1620
02:41:12,113 --> 02:41:15,082
Can I have your attention, please?

1621
02:41:19,220 --> 02:41:21,745
Before we start the party…

1622
02:41:21,923 --> 02:41:28,158
…let’s have a song
to Professor Sprout, Lady Pomfrey...

1623
02:41:28,329 --> 02:41:32,459
…which Mandrake juice is
so he did well...

1624
02:41:32,633 --> 02:41:35,295
…to everyone who was Petrified.

1625
02:41:45,813 --> 02:41:48,805
Also, with recent events...

1626
02:41:48,983 --> 02:41:51,144
…like a school lunch…

1627
02:41:51,319 --> 02:41:55,278
...all exams are over.

1628
02:41:57,959 --> 02:41:59,517
No.

1629
02:42:16,477 --> 02:42:18,502
Sorry this is so long.

1630
02:42:24,552 --> 02:42:28,955
The dog that brought me my exit pass
everything was lost and confused.

1631
02:42:29,290 --> 02:42:32,589
A black bird named Errol.

1632
02:42:48,376 --> 02:42:54,372
And I would just like to say that unless
it’s for you, Harry and Ron…

1633
02:42:54,549 --> 02:42:57,484
…and Hermione, of course…

1634
02:42:58,152 --> 02:43:02,248
...I'd still be you-know-where...

1635
02:43:02,423 --> 02:43:05,984
… so I just want to say thank you.

1636
02:43:15,403 --> 02:43:18,338
There is no Hogwarts
if not you, Hagrid.


1
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,310
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,360
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,090
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,260
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,140
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,130
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,510
Marge. It’s so cool to see…

9
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,100
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this paper.

10
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,600
What is that?

11
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,900
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,730
Then you can, if you move.

13
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,110
I will if he does.

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,410
- Oh, you're still alive, aren't you?
- Whether.

15
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,450
Don’t say yes
in the ungrateful way.

16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,580
Best of luck brother
to protect you.

17
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,080
He was going straight to an orphanage
if it had been thrown at my door. Vernon.

18
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,630
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,590
Give me a hug. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,050
Take Marge’s suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,180
Good.

22
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,430
Finish that for my mother.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,400
- Can I persuade you, Marge?
- Just a little bit.

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,560
Good night, Petunia.

25
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,150
A little more.

26
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,990
Usually just a snack for me,
that with 12 mice.

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,780
Just a little more. That’s a boy.

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,870
You want to try
some brandy?

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,080
A hint of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,380
What do you play?

31
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,380
Where did you send the boy?
Vernon?

32
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,880
Saint Brutus’. good
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,050
Do they use a box
in St. Brutus, young man?

34
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,850
Oh, yes.

35
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,730
Whether. I have been beaten many times.

36
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,480
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,820
...the nonsense of
we won’t hit people enough.

38
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,110
You don’t have to feel guilty
of how this one turned out.

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,200
It’s all about blood.
Bad bleeding.

40
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,540
What did the boy's father do?
Petunia?

41
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,710
Nothing. He didn't work.
He wasn’t working.

42
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,710
- And a drink too, okay?
- That's a lie.

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,420
- What did you say?
- My father was not a drunkard.

44
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,510
Don't worry. Don't worry, Petunia.
I have a very strong load.

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,510
I think it's time for you to go to bed.

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,930
Stop, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,310
Of course, you don’t have to
with his father.

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,270
It’s all to do with his mother.
You see it with dogs all the time.

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,490
If something is wrong with the woman,
then something is wrong with the kitten.

50
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,360
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,120
Right.

52
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,410
Let me tell you…

53
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,980
Vernon!

54
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,820
Vernon! “Vernon, do something!”

55
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Stop!

56
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,410
I got you, Marge. I've got you.

57
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,830
- Stop, stop.
- Get off.

58
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,920
- Don't be proud!
- I'm sorry.

59
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,960
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,880
Oh, God!

61
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,840
Marge!

62
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,100
Please!

63
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,940
Marge!

64
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,190
Come back!

65
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,590
You bring it back!
You return it now.

66
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,010
- You put it right!
- No. He deserved what he got.

67
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,600
- Stay away from me.
- You're not allowed to use magic outside of school.

68
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,810
- Whether? Try me.
- You won't be allowed back now.

69
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,310
You have nowhere to go.

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,820
It doesn’t bother me.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,790
"Welcome to Knight Bus...

72
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,330
... burden of stress
for the imprisoned witch or wizard.

73
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,460
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your boss tonight."

74
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,640
What are you doing down there?

75
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,550
- I fell.
- What are you confused about?

76
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,430
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

77
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,810
Let’s not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,990
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

79
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,910
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,910
No, no, no. I’ll take this.
Enter.

81
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,080
Come on.

82
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,720
Come on. Drive, drive, drive!

83
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,740
- Take it off, Ern.
- Yeah, take it off, Ernie.

84
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,160
It’s going to be a tough road.

85
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,130
- What did you say your name again?
- I didn't.

86
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,800
- Where are you going?
- The emissions. That’s in London.

87
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,930
You hear that Ern? “The excrement.
That's in London."

88
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,430
The emissions.
If you have pea soup…

89
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,390
…make sure you eat
before it eats you.

90
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,440
- But the Muggles. Can't you see me?
- Muggles?

91
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,360
They don’t care, do they?

92
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,070
No, but if you scratch them
with a fork, they feel it.

93
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,870
Ernie, old lady at 12 o’clock!

94
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,170
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,090
...seven, six, five...

96
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,550
...four, three, three and a half...

97
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,550
…two, one and three rounds.

98
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,720
Whether!

99
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,430
Who is that?

100
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,020
The man.

101
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,480
Who is that?

102
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,190
Subject...?

103
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,780
It’s Sirius Black, that’s what.

104
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,620
Don’t tell me you never
I've heard of Sirius Black.

105
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,200
He is a murderer.

106
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,000
He was stuck
in Azkaban because of him.

107
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,080
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,210
He’s the first one to do it.

109
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,800
He was a great supporter of...

110
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,800
...You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,390
I think you've heard of it.

112
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,140
Whether.

113
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,640
He's the one I heard.

114
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,980
Ernie, two two stories
in 12 hours.

115
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,150
They’re getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,190
Ernie, they’re on us!

117
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,990
Think about it in your head.

118
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,830
Right, guys? Guys?

119
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,210
Why the big faces?

120
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,470
Yes, yes. Almost there. Almost there.

121
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,310
- The emissions.
- Another dungeon, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,320
Tate Potter, finally.

123
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,030
- Take it off, Ern.
- Yeah, take it off, Ernie!

124
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,050
Room 11.

125
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,980
Hedwig.

126
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,980
Smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,860
He got here just
five minutes ahead of you.

128
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,400
As Minister of Magic, it is my duty
to tell you, Mr. Potter…

129
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,780
…earlier tonight
your uncle's sister was...

130
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,910
…somewhere south of Sheffield,
covering a chimney.

131
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,830
The unexpected change in
The department was immediately dispatched.

132
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,800
It was well divided
and his mind changed.

133
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,680
He won’t remember anything
about the events that took place.

134
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,430
So that’s it…

135
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,470
…and they didn’t do anything wrong.

136
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,470
Pea soup?

137
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,770
No, thank you.

138
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,150
- Minister?
- Whether?

139
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,060
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

140
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,820
I broke the rules. Underage witches
they cannot use magic at home.

141
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,030
Come now. The Ministry
doesn’t send people to Azkaban…

142
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,740
…because they destroyed their aunts.

143
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,250
On the other hand, running
well, because it's stuff...

144
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,880
…it was really, really bad.

145
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,880
- "How are things," sir?
- We have a murderer on the loose.

146
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,880
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,800
But what does it have to do with me?

148
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,930
Nothing, really. You're fine.
And that's what matters.

149
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,270
And tomorrow you will be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,400
This is your new textbook.
I took that liberty...

151
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,570
…which led them here.
Now Tom will show you around your room.

152
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,700
Hedwig.

153
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,960
Oh, by the way, Harry. When you are
here, it would be much better if it didn’t…

154
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,710
...wander.

155
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,170
Right! you’re going to
the bus or whatever?

156
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,000
Clean house.

157
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,670
I'll be back later.

158
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,680
I advise you, Hermione.

159
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,560
Get the monster away from Scabbers,
or replace it with a tea cozy.

160
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,810
It's a dog, Ronald.
What are you waiting for?

161
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,980
- It's in his life.
- A dog? Is that what they told you?

162
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,700
- It looks like a dog's tail, if you ask me.
- That's delicious...

163
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,410
...comes from his
from those old, worn-out shoes.

164
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,990
Crookshanks, just ignore them
the bad boy.

165
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,790
Harry.

166
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,290
Harry.

167
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,540
- Egypt. How is it?
- Bright. Lots of old stuff...

168
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,090
…like mummies, graves,
even Scabbers was amused.

169
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,470
- Egyptians loved cats.
- With the dust beetle.

170
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,800
- You're not showing the secret again, are you Ron?
- I haven't shown it to anyone.

171
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,390
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,970
- The Time Servant.
- Night shift worker.

173
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,270
- The chef.
- The guy who fixed the bathroom.

174
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,850
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,190
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Good to see you.

176
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,690
- Do you have everything you need?
- Whether.

177
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,030
- Whether? All your books?
- Yes, everything is upstairs.

178
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,610
- Your clothes?
- Everything there is.

179
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,200
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

180
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,240
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

181
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,910
- Harry, do you mind if I can have a word?
- Yes, of course.

182
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,750
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,540
- Are you waiting for an update?
- Whether. It should be big.

184
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,460
Harry, there are some in the Ministry
It would make me so sad...

185
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,300
...what I say what I say
to show you.

186
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,800
But I think you should
to know the truth.

187
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,520
You're in danger.

188
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,690
Too dangerous.

189
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,810
What will this
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,030
What do you know
of Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,900
- The only escape from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

192
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,410
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

193
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,410
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

194
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,910
I'm sorry.

195
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,000
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,790
…Black lost everything.

197
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,250
But it's still alive
a faithful servant.

198
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,590
And in his mind...

199
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
... just you
what stands in the way...

200
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,680
...from You-Know-Who
return to power.

201
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,020
And so...

202
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,730
...has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,770
To find you.

204
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,860
And he killed me.

205
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,490
Harry, will you advise me
about what you’ll hear…

206
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,200
…you don’t go looking for Black.

207
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,910
Mr. Weasley…

208
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,080
…why would I go looking for
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,500
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,620
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,420
Oh, for goodness sake!

212
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,090
Don't miss it!

213
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,220
I didn’t want to mess it up. Not just...

214
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,840
- I lost control.
- Bright.

215
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,600
Honestly, Ron, it doesn’t matter.
Harry was lucky he wasn't kicked out.

216
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,520
I was lucky I wasn’t stopped.

217
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,730
I still think it was great.

218
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,650
Come on. All other places are full.

219
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,860
Who do you think it is?

220
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,900
- Professor RJ Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

221
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,200
How does he know everything?

222
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,490
- It's in his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

223
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,080
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- That's right. Why?

224
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,920
I have to tell you something.

225
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,470
Let me get this straightened out.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban…

226
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
...to come later?
- Whether.

227
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
But they’ll catch Black, won’t they?

228
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,520
- I mean, everybody's looking for it.
- Sure.

229
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,030
It’s just that no one ever leaves
of Azkaban before...

230
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,200
…and he’s a murderer, seriously.
- Thanks, Ron.

231
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,280
Why are we stopping?

232
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,080
We can't get there.

233
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,540
What has happened?

234
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,420
I do not know.
Maybe we’re confused.

235
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,670
Ouch, Ron! That was my foot.

236
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,470
There’s something moving out there.

237
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,110
I think someone will come on board.

238
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,180
Bloody hell! What has happened?

239
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,880
Harry.

240
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,800
Harry, are you okay?

241
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,640
Thank you.

242
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,270
Here, take this. It will help.

243
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,900
It's all good. It’s chocolate.

244
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,280
What was the thing that came?

245
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,870
Elijah is a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's over now.

246
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,740
He was looking for the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,540
If you’ll excuse me, I need to keep
a little chat with the driver.

248
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,050
Eat. You will feel better.

249
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,180
What happened to me?

250
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,100
Well, like you went hard.

251
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,430
We thought maybe you were
he has an illness or something.

252
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,980
And one of you...

253
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,480
...You know...

254
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,730
…you smile?
- No.

255
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,610
This felt strange, though.

256
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,610
That I would never be happy again.

257
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,080
But someone was screaming.

258
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,620
A woman.

259
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
Nobody was screaming, Harry.

260
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Welcome! Come back next year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,770
Now, I want to say a few words…

262
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,270
…before we all figure it out
with our delicious food.

263
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,690
First, I will gladly accept
Professor RJ Lupine...

264
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,320
...which is well received
to fill the role...

265
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,990
…which you will protect yourself with
the master of the Dark Arts.

266
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,700
Good luck, teacher.

267
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,630
Of course. So he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,460
Potter. Did you really smile?

269
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,300
- I mean, did you really faint?
"Stop, Malfoy."

270
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,470
- How did he know?
- Just forget it.

271
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,010
Our wildlife protection
teacher for many years...

272
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,100
…preparing to relax…

273
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,020
…so you can spend more time
with his legs still attached.

274
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,940
Fortunately,
I’m happy to tell you…

275
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,940
...whose work will be taken
with no one else...

276
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,450
…than our Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,500
Finally, on a more concerning note…

278
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,210
…to the question
from the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:04,590
…Hogwarts will, until further notice,
welcome the dementors of Azkaban…

280
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,720
…until then
as Sirius Black was arrested.

281
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,350
The dementors will form
at all the gates of the country.

282
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,190
Now that I’ve been persuaded…

283
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,030
…whose hopes will not hinder
what we do every day...

284
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,530
…a word of caution.

285
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,900
Dementors are dangerous creatures.
They won't explain...

286
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,490
...half of the search results
and what gets in their way.

287
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,290
Therefore, I must say
each and every one of you...

288
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,080
…to give them nothing
to hurt you.

289
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,960
It’s not in the world
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,390
But you know,
happiness can be found...

291
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,180
…even in the darkest of days…

292
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,270
…if one only remembers
to turn on the lights.

293
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Greater Fortune.

294
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,790
Here, listen.
He just won’t let me in.”

295
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,920
- Greater Fortune.
- No, No, No! Wait, wait.

296
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,920
Look at this.

297
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,640
- Amazing. Just in my own words.
- Greater Fortune.

298
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,400
- Yeah, okay. Enter.
- Thank you.

299
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
I’m still doing that after three years.

300
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,740
- He can't play.
- Exactly.

301
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,120
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

302
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,530
- Oh, God!
- It's too bad.

303
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,660
Green. It’s a monkey.

304
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,130
- What's that?
- You summoned a monkey?

305
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,500
Don't give it back.

306
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,300
Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,140
- Ron, hold on.
- I will.

308
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,440
I think we have a winner.

309
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,730
- Oh, don't try any of them.
- No.

310
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,860
Look at him. Up.

311
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,740
Welcome, children.

312
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:18,040
In this room, you will look for
the good work of Divination.

313
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,500
In this room, you will find
if you have the perspective.

314
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,880
Hello. I’m Professor Trelawney.

315
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,680
We will shoot together
in the future.

316
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,720
This article, we will focus on Tasseomancy,
which is the art of counting tea leaves.

317
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,480
So please, take the cup
from the person sitting next to you.

318
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,350
What do you see?

319
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,190
The truth is buried as a word
deep inside a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,820
But first, you need to expand
your mind.

321
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,530
- First, you have to look at the distance.
- What a lot of garbage.

322
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,620
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

323
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,460
- I've been here all this time.
- You, young man...

324
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,920
Is your grandmother okay?

325
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,040
That’s what I think.

326
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,010
I wouldn’t really know about that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,380
Pity.

328
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,220
Expand your knowledge.

329
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,140
Your aura is flickering, darling.
Do you live far away?

330
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,230
- I think you are.
- Sure.

331
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,650
Look at the bowl.
Let me know what you see.

332
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,530
Whether.

333
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,780
Harry has a weakness.
It’s trial and error.

334
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,870
And there could be sun
and that's fun.

335
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,410
So...

336
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,620
...you will suffer,
but you will be happy with it.

337
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,170
Give me the cup.

338
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,630
Oh, my dear son!

339
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,380
My dear...

340
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,140
…you have the Grim.

341
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,720
The dog? What is the Grin?

342
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,770
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,100
“It’s like a big blind dog.

344
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,770
It's one of the worst shows
in our world.

345
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,980
It's a sign...

346
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,990
...of death."

347
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,330
Don’t you think the thing about Grim
you have something to do with Sirius Black, don't you?

348
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,420
Oh, sure, Ron. If you ask me,
Witchcraft is an interesting subject.

349
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,290
Now, Ancient Runes,
that’s a very interesting topic.

350
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,590
Ancient runes? Amount
subjects you study?

351
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,420
A few.

352
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,680
Wait. That's impossible.

353
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,640
Ancient runes in
same time as Divination.

354
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,810
You must be in second
class at once.

355
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,350
Don't be stupid. How could anyone
in two classes at once?

356
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,770
"Expand your horizons.
Inner Eye to see the future."

357
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,860
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
He doesn’t talk much, unless it bothers you.

358
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,910
Today I had a real treat.

359
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,070
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,420
Yes, you a lot. He doesn’t talk much.
Create a group there.

361
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,090
And turn to page 49.

362
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,880
How exactly do we do that?

363
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,970
Just cut the spine, of course.
That's good.

364
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,150
- Don't be such a jerk, Longbottom.
- I'm fine. Good.

365
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,030
- I think they're amazing.
- Oh, yes. It’s so beautiful.

366
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,700
Cunning. God, this place
went to the monster.

367
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,580
Wait until Dad hears about Dumbledore
i got this class wrong.

368
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,880
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,430
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,530
- Just look at it.
- You have to break it.

371
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,160
Whether.

372
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,380
Isn’t it beautiful?

373
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,170
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,010
Hagrid, what exactly is that?

375
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,260
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,930
Before you want to know about hippogriff
They are very proud animals.

377
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,020
We get offended very quickly.
You don’t want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,940
It might just be the last thing you do.

379
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,480
Now, who wants to come
and say okay?

380
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,110
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,280
Come now.

382
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,160
Now...

383
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,080
…you have to let him do the first
move. It’s just too good. So...

384
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,120
...go up. Give it a nice shake.

385
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,750
Then you wait
and see if he comes back.

386
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,050
If he does, you can go play him.

387
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,420
Otherwise… Well,
we’ll get to that later.

388
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,140
Just make your bow.

389
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,390
Nice and low.

390
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,400
Come back, Harry. Go back.

391
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,780
Stop.

392
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,450
Stop.

393
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,040
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you’re a big dog, man.

394
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,090
Right. I think you can go
and play it now.

395
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,130
Go away. Don't be shy.

396
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,020
Nice and long lasting, now.
Quality and long lasting. Slow.

397
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,770
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,110
Stop, Harry. That's...

399
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,490
Quality and long lasting.
Now let him come with you.

400
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,710
No, no more, no more, no more...

401
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,710
That's...

402
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,670
Whether!

403
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,670
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Can he fly?

405
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,430
- I think he might let you ride him now.
- What is?

406
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,180
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,520
Put yourself here,
just behind the wings.

408
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,560
Don't pull out a single hair.
because he won't thank you for it.

409
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,000
Well done, Harry, and ​well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,130
That was rude, Harry!

411
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,710
Oh, please.

412
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,840
Well done, well done.

413
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,720
- How do I handle the first date?
- Very well, Master.

414
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,350
You’re not scary, are you,
you big bad monster!

415
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,940
Malfoy, boss…

416
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,310
No!

417
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,650
Buckbeak!

418
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,990
So, so, so...

419
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,950
Oh! Buckbeak!

420
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,410
Go away, you stupid creature...

421
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,700
- It's killing me!
- Sit down. Just a slice!

422
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,120
Hagrid!

423
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:25,500
- He needs to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm a teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,420
- You're going to regret this.
- Lessons published!

425
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,880
You and your bloody cat!

426
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,410
Does it hurt too much, Draco?

427
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,460
It comes and goes.
Still, I think I’ve been lucky.

428
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,960
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could have lost my arm.

429
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,170
- I haven't been able to do my homework for a few weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

430
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,680
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- Even if Hagrid wasn't kicked out.

431
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,600
I can hear Draco's father groaning.
We haven’t heard the end of this.

432
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,640
- They've seen it!
- Subject?

433
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,560
Sirius Black!

434
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Dufftown? It's not far from here.

435
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,650
You don’t think he would
at Hogwarts, eh?

436
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,320
- With dementors at every door?
- Dementors?

437
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,820
He happened upon them once.
Who can say no to it?

438
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:40,580
That's true. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,540
That’s how you try to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,730
Pretty amazing, isn’t it?

441
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,740
Anyone want to join
a thought...

442
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,700
...what's inside?

443
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,910
- It's a boggart, that's it.
- Very well, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,580
Now, maybe someone can tell me
what does a boggart look like?

445
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,840
- Nobody knows.
- When did he get here?

446
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,550
Boggarts are shapeshifters.

447
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,970
They take shape from what
a person is terrified.

448
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,590
- That's what makes them...
- It's terrible, yes, yes, yes...

449
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,270
Fortunately, there is a very easy solution
to take down a boggart.

450
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,400
Let’s do it now.
Not with wood, please.

451
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,190
Then from me. Riddiculous!

452
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,530
- Ridkulus!
- Very good.

453
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,240
A little loud and bright.
Listen:

454
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,660
- Ridkulus!
- Ridkulus!

455
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,950
- This article is terrible.
- Very good.

456
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,160
So much for the simple. Tickets,
music alone is not enough.

457
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:12,080
What actually ends a boggart
it’s laughter.

458
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,710
You have to force him to think
something you really like.

459
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,010
Let me explain. Neville,
would you like to join me?

460
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,550
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,220
Come on.

462
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,190
Hello. Neville, what scares you
of all?

463
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,060
Professor Snape.

464
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,110
- I'm sorry?
- Professor Snape.

465
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,690
Professor Snape. Yes, it surprises everyone.

466
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,370
- I believe,You live with your grandmother.
- Yeah but I don't want the boggart to become him, either.

467
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,450
No...

468
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,080
...will not do. I want you
to draw her clothes.

469
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,540
Only his clothes, very white,
in your mind.

470
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,840
- She's carrying a red bag...
- We don't need to hear it.

471
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,880
As soon as you see it, we see it.
Now, when I open the lid…

472
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,390
…this is what I want
you to do it. Excuse me.

473
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,760
Think Professor Snape
in your grandmother’s clothes.

474
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,680
Can you do that?

475
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,980
Whether. Wand ready.

476
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,810
One, two, three.

477
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,490
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,290
Riddiculous!

479
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,500
Well, Neville, cool!
Incredible! Good...

480
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,630
...in the background, Neville.
Everyone, get in line...

481
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,180
Draw a line!

482
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,770
I hope everyone represents that kind of thing
they are so scared...

483
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,060
…and do something funny.

484
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,980
Next! Ron!

485
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,740
Concentrate. Face your fears.
Be strong!

486
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,750
Wand is ready, Ron.

487
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,340
Riddiculous!

488
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,840
Whether!

489
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:25,340
Do you see? Very, very good!

490
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,680
It’s so beautiful! Really, really, really
good! Parvati! Next!

491
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,690
Show me what you see.

492
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,370
Hold your nerve. Prompt.

493
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,490
Riddiculous!

494
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,500
And then! Get up, get up!

495
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,420
Well, cool!

496
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,560
Here!

497
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,230
Riddiculous!

498
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,660
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for now.

499
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,830
Gather your books behind the class.

500
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,620
That’s the end of the article.
Thank you! I'm sorry!

501
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,830
Sorry, you may have too much
which is a good thing.

502
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,420
Now remember, this trip to Hogsmeade
small town is a blessing.

503
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,550
Should your actions be obvious?
at the school in any direction…

504
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,640
...success cannot
let it grow again.

505
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,390
There is no registration form,
no visit to the village.

506
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,100
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,520
Everyone who has a chance, follow me.
Those who don’t have it, stay away.

508
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,190
I thought if you sign,
then we could...

509
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,860
I can't. Single parent
or a custodian can sign it.

510
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,240
Because I am not one,
would be inappropriate.

511
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:17,120
Sorry, Potter.
That’s my last word.

512
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,580
Forget it, guys. See you later.

513
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,430
Professor, can I ask you something?

514
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,480
You want to know why I blocked you
fights the boggart, doesn’t it?

515
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,110
I thought it was pretty obvious.

516
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,110
I thought he would get that
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,780
First I thought of Voldemort.

518
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,620
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,330
…and the dementor.
- I like it a lot.

520
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,370
That reveals your biggest fear
it is fear itself.

521
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,040
This is very clever.

522
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,290
Before I played...

523
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,540
...I heard something.

524
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,710
A woman...

525
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,510
... screams.

526
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,970
Dementors force us to live
our intelligence is completely wrong.

527
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,100
Our weakness becomes their strength.

528
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,140
I think it was my mother…

529
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,520
…the night of the murder.

530
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,610
The first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,030
Not with your waist, but with your eyes.

532
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,610
They’re your mother, Lily.

533
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:34,990
Whether.

534
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,330
Oh, yes. I knew it.

535
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,500
Your mother was there with me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,920
Not only does he
a very talented magician...

537
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,420
...was also
a very kind woman.

538
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,010
He had a way of lookin
the qualities of others…

539
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:01,350
...however, and ​ especially, when the
a person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,520
And your father, James.
on the other hand…

541
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,230
...Already...

542
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,070
He had one, shall we say?
talent for suffering.

543
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,870
A talent, rumor has it,
he got through to you.

544
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,830
You are more like them
you know, Harry.

545
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,800
Then, you come to see
just how much.

546
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,640
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is awesome,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,390
We will never go
at the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,600
- You've heard the most...
- Haunted Houses in Britain. I know.

549
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,480
What has happened?

550
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,110
Maybe Neville forgot
the word again.

551
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,690
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

552
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,160
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I’m Head Boy!

553
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,450
Come back, all of you.

554
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,790
No one is allowed in this bedroom
until it has been sought.

555
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,290
The fat woman! He’s gone!

556
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,840
It does the right thing.
He was a terrible musician.

557
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,920
It’s not fun, Ron.

558
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,010
Relax, everyone. Divide into fourths.
Go back to your room.

559
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:25,390
- Stop.
- Make way.

560
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,560
- Here's the teacher.
- Come on, stop.

561
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,650
You heard it. Move!

562
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,750
Mr. Filch? Gather the monsters.

563
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,170
Tell them to find each picture
in the castle to meet the giantess.

564
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,460
We don't need monsters, Master.

565
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,430
The fat lady is right there.

566
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,260
Think about where you’re going! Stop!

567
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,510
Listen to him! I’m Head Boy!

568
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,100
- Get back here!
- Move on!

569
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,570
Who did this to you, my love?

570
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,530
Eyes like the Devil, he has,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,450
Yeah, teacher.
The one everyone talks about.

572
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,080
He’s right here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,500
Sirius Black!

574
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:33,840
Save the house, Mr. Filch.
All of you, go to the castle.

575
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:06,830
Looking into the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,540
- Thank you.
- The third floor is also lit, sir.

577
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,710
- Very good.
- I've done the prison.

578
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,540
There is no sign of Blackness, anywhere
in the castle.

579
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,250
I didn’t really expect him to stay.

580
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,840
Quite a job, don’t you think?

581
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,300
To enter Hogwarts Castle
all alone...

582
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:26,140
...don't know anything?
- Very well, yes.

583
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,180
Any theories on how he did it?

584
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,350
Crush. Each is not as real as the other.

585
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,150
You may remember...

586
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,150
…before class starts
I expressed my concerns...

587
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,400
…about your decision
from the teacher...

588
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,660
There is not a single teacher in this castle
it would help Sirius Black get inside.

589
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,240
I truly believe
the castle is secure...

590
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,040
…and I’m more than willing to share
the students in their homes.

591
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,540
What's wrong with Potter?
Does he need to be warned?

592
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,380
Maybe. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,960
Because in dreams, we enter a world
that belongs to all of us.

594
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:06,760
Let them swim in the deepest sea
or jump into the tallest cloud.

595
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,430
Turn to page 394.

596
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,440
Excuse me, sir.
Where is Professor Lupine?

597
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,570
That’s not really your concern,
Is that it, Potter?

598
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,620
All you have to do is say your teacher
found incapable of teaching...

599
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,870
...at this point.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,380
"Wolves"?

601
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,460
Sir, we just learned about the black caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,840
- We don't need to start that many weeks.
- Quiet.

603
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:30,220
When did he come in?
Did you see him come in?

604
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,350
Now, which one of you
can tell me things...

605
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,980
...half an Animagus
and a wolf?

606
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,610
Nobody?

607
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:43,030
- How frustrating.
- Please, sir.

608
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,400
An Animagus is a wizard
who chooses to become an animal.

609
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,110
A wolf has no choice.

610
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,240
With each passing month...

611
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:54,290
...he doesn't remember who he is anymore.
He would kill his best friend.

612
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,080
Again, the guy just answers
with the music of his own.

613
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,000
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:04,510
...you're talking about the wrong thing,
Miss Granger.

615
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,670
Can't you
of getting stuck...

616
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,180
...or proud
in an intolerant know-it-all?

617
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,890
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five Gryffindor points.

618
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,690
As an unknown drug,
and on my desk, on Monday morning…

619
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:22,610
…two rolls of parchment paper
on the wolf, with emphasis…

620
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,320
...in you'll know.
- Tomorrow is Quidditch.

621
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,780
Then I tell you to be careful,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:34,040
Losing a limb doesn’t exonerate you.

623
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,000
Page 394.

624
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,460
The word "wolf"...

625
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,880
…it’s a song
from the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

626
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:52,050
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Wolf, werewolf.

627
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,060
There are many
to become a wolf.

628
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,270
They are also given the ability to
shapeshifting...

629
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,440
…being kissed by a wolf…

630
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,880
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,500
Arrest momentum!

632
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,880
- He looks a little rough, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

633
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,340
What are you waiting for?
He fell more than 100 feet here.

634
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,380
Come on Ron, let’s get you out of the Astronomy Tower
and see how it looks.

635
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,640
Maybe a better view is better
which he always does.

636
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:46,270
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, that's great.

637
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,440
You gave us a good scare there my friend.

638
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:52,190
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,820
Really? I meant the game. Who won?

640
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,950
Nobody blames you, Harry.

641
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,000
Dementors should not enter
the country. Dumbledore was furious.

642
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,290
After he has saved you,
sent them immediately.

643
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,130
There is another
you should know too, Harry.

644
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:18,010
As you fell, your broom seemed to explode
in the Whomping Willow, and...

645
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,010
Good...

646
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,560
Sorry to hear
of your broom.

647
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,520
Isn’t there a way to fix it?

648
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,060
No.

649
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,560
Master, for the dementors
is it affecting me?

650
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,070
- I mean, more than anyone else?
- Listen.

651
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:38,400
Dementors are the most dangerous creatures
to navigate the world.

652
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:42,870
They eat whatever feels good,
all good ideas...

653
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:48,000
…until one person is left with all
nothing but horrible experiences.

654
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:52,420
You're not strong, Harry.

655
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:56,670
Dementors really hurt you because
there are scary truths in your past.

656
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,970
Surprise your teachers
I can’t imagine.

657
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,720
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:06,970
- I'm afraid, Master.
- Well!, I'd consider you a fool otherwise.

659
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,650
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,810
You did that one
go by train.

661
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,770
There was only one that night.

662
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:19,650
- But you made him go.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:24,950
But as dementors seem
because I had a crush on you...

664
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,790
...I can teach you.
But after the party.

665
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,870
Right now, I need to rest.

666
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,610
Last word on Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:18,210
- Brothers, let me go.
- Smart, Harry.

668
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,300
- But he's not very smart.
- Besides, we have a better way.

669
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:24,300
- I want to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

670
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,680
We'll take you there.

671
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,560
- We'll show you a faster way.
- If you sneeze.

672
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,310
- Bless you.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. No...

673
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,520
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

674
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,070
What are you doing?!

675
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,150
- What is this garbage?
- "What is this garbage?" he says.

676
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,660
- The map, is the key to success.
- It's a key given to you, trust me...

677
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,740
But we’ve already thought
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,660
George, if you please.

679
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:54,120
I swear with all my heart
that I’m not good at.

680
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:01,340
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

681
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,720
… we’re excited to introduce
the Marauder's Map."

682
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,220
We owe them a lot.

683
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,600
Wait. It’s Hogwarts.
And that...

684
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:17,230
- No. Certain...?
- Dumbledore.

685
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,730
- In his class.
- Pacing.

686
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,860
It does that a lot.

687
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,900
- So you mean this map shows...
- All. All.

688
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,110
- Everyone, wherever they are.
- What they're doing.

689
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,410
- Every minute.
- All the time.

690
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,580
- Bright! Where did you get it?
- Booed from Filch's office, of course.

691
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:32,500
- First year.
- Now listen, there are seven secret passages...

692
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,330
... of the house.
- We'll recommend this one.

693
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,670
- The one-eyed path.
- Takes you straight to Honeyduke's Cellar.

694
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,670
Hurry. Filch goes this way.

695
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,260
Oh and don’t forget Harry. When you are done,
just click on it and say:

696
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:48,760
"Crimes he committed."
Otherwise, everyone can read it.

697
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,300
Now, how much do you want?

698
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,520
Delicious.

699
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,610
It is meant to be the deadliest
manufactured in Britain. Did I mention that?

700
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,450
Twice.

701
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,490
Want to get a little closer?

702
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,410
In the Shrieking Shack?

703
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,580
Yes, I’m fine here.

704
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,580
Okay, okay. Look who's here.

705
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,250
You guys are buying new
your dream home?

706
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,760
A little big for you, isn’t it, Weasle-Bee?
Don’t your family sleep in the same room?

707
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,180
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very good.

708
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:15,600
Boys, I think it's time to teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect her subjects.

709
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:19,230
- I hope you don't mean you.
- How dare you talk to me!

710
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,400
You are a piece of shit!

711
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:27,150
Who is that?

712
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,740
- Don't stop there! Do something!
- What is?

713
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,850
“What’s going on, Malfoy?” Have you lost your skis?

714
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,230
Get out of the way!

715
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,020
Move!

716
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,480
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,200
Harry!

718
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,410
Too much blood, Harry.
That wasn’t pretty.

719
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,830
The dogs! He never told me
from a Marauder's Map.

720
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,460
Harry won't keep it. It will return
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,670
- Not you?
- Sure. With his invisibility clothes.

722
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,340
Look who it is. Mrs. Rosmerta.

723
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,850
- Ron loves him.
- That's not true!

724
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,890
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

725
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,430
Excuse me, minister.

726
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,480
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

727
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,600
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope it works well.

728
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:48,690
It would be ideal if the Ministry
he wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,900
…at my pub every night!
- We have...

730
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,530
- We have a murderer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:59,330
And what would bring him here?

732
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:03,660
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

733
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,580
Come.

734
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:10,130
Harry!

735
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:22,310
- No underage witches allowed!
- Close the damn door!

736
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,520
- It's too bad.
- Thick head.

737
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,350
- Are their hair too thick?!
- How dare they!

738
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,730
- Who are they called big hair?
- Young fighters!

739
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,400
Nobody comes to a pub where
they will be scared to death.

740
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:38,490
Professor Dumbledore refuses to
dements around the area.

741
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:43,080
Now tell me what all this means.

742
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:47,710
Well, many years ago, when Harry Potter’s parents
they felt they were marked for death…

743
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,540
Think? They went into hiding.
Only a few knew where they were.

744
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,590
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he said to You-Know-Who.

745
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,010
Not only did Black carry
with the Potters that night...

746
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,560
…but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,980
- Peter Pettigrew?
- A little gem of a boy.

748
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,390
- Always behind Sirius Black's back.
- I remember.

749
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,400
Never leave James and Sirius
from the front.

750
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,320
- But what happened?
- Well Peter Pettigrew was trying to warn the Potters...

751
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,650
…and could, if not
running into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,700
Black was terrible.
He didn’t kill Pettigrew.

753
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,080
He destroyed it!

754
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:27,460
A finger. That was all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:30,670
While Sirius Black may not have
laid hands on the Potters...

756
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,050
...but he's responsible for the deaths.
- And now he wants to finish what he started.

757
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:37,090
- I don't believe it.
- It's not the worst.

758
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,050
- What could possibly go wrong?
- This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,390
…and it still is to this day…

760
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:45,470
...Harry Potter father!

761
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:56,400
Ron, look!

762
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,660
- Sorry, sorry. Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me.
- Merry christmas.

763
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,990
Harry, what happened?

764
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,620
He was their friend...

765
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,380
…and delivered them.

766
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:55,130
He was their friend!

767
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,340
I hope he finds me.

768
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:02,300
Because when it does,
I’ll get ready!

769
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,390
When he does, I'll kill him!

770
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:21,280
Harry.

771
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,450
There you are. You came.

772
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,700
Are you sure about this, Harry?
Now this is full-blown magic…

773
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:30,330
... far beyond the Ordinary
Wizard Level.

774
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,040
I know.

775
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,080
Well, everything is set.

776
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:38,710
Now the language I will try and teach you
It’s called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,380
Have you ever heard of it?

778
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,220
No? Good...

779
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:45,970
A Patronus is a kind of positive energy.
For the wizard attracted to a...

780
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:50,810
... acts as a shield, with the
dementor bites instead of him.

781
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,810
But to make it work,
You have to think of an idea.

782
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:58,940
It’s not just a memory, it’s a thrill
mind, a very strong mind.

783
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:02,950
Can you do this?
Whether. Very good.

784
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,370
Close your eyes.

785
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,040
Concentrate.

786
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,370
Find out what happened.

787
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,750
Do you have an idea?

788
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,550
Let it fill you.

789
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,340
Get lost in it.

790
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:28,010
Then say the words,
Expecto Patronum.

791
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,270
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

792
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:38,400
Shall we do it? Wand ready.

793
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,830
Wait Patronum!

794
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:02,960
Wait... Wait...

795
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,920
Expect...

796
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:11,010
Here we go. Come on.
Sit down. It’s too long.

797
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:15,100
It's all good. I wasn’t expecting you
to do it for the first time.

798
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,650
That would be great.
Here, take this. You will feel better.

799
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,360
- That's a bad dementor.
- No, no, no.

800
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:27,320
That was a boggart, Harry.
It’s a boggart.

801
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:30,660
The reality will be far worse.
Very, very bad.

802
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,450
As a matter of interest,
What were you thinking?

803
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:37,330
- What idea did you choose?
- The first time I ever rode a broom.

804
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,880
That's not good.
It’s not really good.

805
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:53,970
There's another one.
Not happy, of course.

806
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:58,060
Well, that’s it.

807
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,810
It’s the happiest I’ve ever felt…

808
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:04,900
…but it’s hard.
- Is it strong?

809
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,160
Then let’s try it. Think you’re ready?

810
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,700
Just do it.

811
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,010
Wait Patronum!

812
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,180
Wait Patronum!

813
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:56,910
Whether!

814
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:02,290
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,960
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Whether. Sit down. Here.

816
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,550
Take this, it will help. It really helps.

817
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,510
And just so you know, Harry…

818
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,680
…I think you would give it to your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,890
…says something.

820
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,060
I was thinking about him.

821
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,400
And my mother.

822
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,820
He sees their faces.

823
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,150
They were talking to me.

824
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,570
I'm just talking.

825
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:35,070
That’s the concept I chose.

826
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,160
I don't even know if it's true.

827
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,830
But it's the best I've got.

828
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,380
- Good day.
- Gorgeous.

829
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,550
Unless you were actually ripped off!

830
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,140
Divided?
What are you saying?

831
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:01,480
- Ronald has lost his dog.
- I haven't lost anything!

832
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,770
- Your dog killed him!
- Trash.

833
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,270
Harry, you’ve seen the way
the bloodthirsty creature...

834
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,360
...always hidden.
And Scabbers is dead.

835
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:14,410
Well, maybe you should learn
take good care of your pets!

836
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,660
- Your dog killed him!
- I didn't.

837
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,330
- Did.
- I didn't.

838
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:23,000
How did it go, Hagrid? The audience?

839
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,460
Well, first, the committee members
have changed...

840
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:29,300
…talks about why we’re there.

841
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,840
I got up and did my homework.
He explained how Buckbeak...

842
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,970
...was a good hippogriff,
he always brushed his teeth.

843
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,220
And then Lucius Malfoy stood up.
Well, you might think.

844
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:43,600
He said Buckbeak was a murderer
and a dangerous creature...

845
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:46,810
…who would kill you
they will easily notice you.

846
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,810
And then?

847
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,230
And then he asked the worst question,
said the old Lucius.

848
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,530
- They don't fire you!
- No, I haven't been fired.

849
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,620
Buckbeak has been sentenced to death!

850
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,030
Spiders! There are... There are spiders.
Spiders. They want me to play.

851
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,780
- I don't want to dance!
- Tell the spiders.

852
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:40,950
Yes, yes. Tell them. I’ll tell them…

853
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,260
- Peter Pettigrew?
- A little gem of a boy.

854
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,560
- Always behind Sirius Black's back.
- Black was terrible.

855
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,230
He didn’t kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed it!

856
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,780
- Turn on the lights!
- I'm sorry.

857
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:06,160
- Look there, boy.
- We want to sleep here!

858
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,960
Mistakes made. Nox.

859
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,510
Potter.

860
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,180
What do you do
walking the halls at night?

861
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:25,510
I was sleeping.

862
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,220
So much better than your father
Take it, Potter.

863
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:33,150
He was also very proud,
walking around the castle.

864
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:37,690
My father wasn’t too upset. And neither do I.

865
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,530
If you don’t mind, I’d appreciate it
if you could lower your staff.

866
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,950
Unpack your bags.

867
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,250
Get your bags out!

868
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:55,790
What is this?

869
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,210
- Save some parchment paper.
- Really? Open it.

870
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,470
Reveal what you're hiding.

871
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,730
Read it.

872
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:22,700
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs…

873
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:26,990
… give them their thanks
with Professor Snape and…”

874
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,780
Go away.

875
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:33,830
"And please keep his big nose
of others' work."

876
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,580
- You're kidding...
- Master!

877
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:40,920
Okay, okay. Lupine.

878
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:45,800
Go out for a short walk
in the moonlight, right?

879
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:49,600
Harry, are you okay?

880
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,270
That remains to be seen.

881
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,850
Today I just released
something that is very surprising.

882
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:00,570
Look, Lupine.
It should be your familiar territory.

883
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:05,530
- Of course, it's full of darkness.
"I think so, Severus."

884
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,200
It looks like it would be parchment
it was made to make fun of someone...

885
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:13,250
…who wants to read.
I think it’s a Zonko design.

886
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:17,670
Nevertheless, I will look for
any hidden traits it may contain.

887
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,960
It is, after all, as you say,
my familiar territory.

888
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:24,470
Harry, could you come with me,
please? Professor, good evening.

889
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,220
Are you listening? Turn off the lights!

890
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,770
Enter.

891
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:46,780
I don't know Harry how this map
came to keep...

892
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:51,450
…but honestly, I’m surprised
that you did not deliver.

893
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:55,290
Have you ever thought about this,
in the hands of Sirius Black…

894
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:57,460
...a map for you?

895
01:17:58,290 --> 01:18:00,750
- No.
- No, sir.

896
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,800
Your father never packed much
with the rules as well.

897
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:10,300
But he and your mother
they gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:15,020
Games their gifts
by walking around the castle unprotected...

899
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:19,650
…with a murderer on the loose
seems like such a terrible way to reward them!

900
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,020
Now, I won't bother you again.

901
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:24,650
- Harry, do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

902
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:28,490
I want you to go back to bed
and stay there.

903
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:33,410
And don't follow any path.
If you do, I’ll know.

904
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,500
Professor, just so you know,
I don’t think the map always works.

905
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:48,340
First, it showed someone in the room.
Someone I know is dead.

906
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,510
Oh really? And who might that be?

907
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,220
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,930
That's impossible.

909
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,810
Just what I saw.

910
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:05,360
Good evening, Master.

911
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:13,030
Expand your knowledge.
You have to see what happens.

912
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,620
The crystal vision
it is in the opening of the Inner Eye.

913
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:22,120
That's the only way you can see it. Please try again.

914
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,750
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:29,300
Do you want me to try it?

916
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,680
The Grim, maybe.

917
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:40,940
My friend, from day one
you sat in my class...

918
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,900
…I realized you didn’t have
the right spirit...

919
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,990
...for the noble cause of Divination.
Not, you see, there.

920
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:52,820
You may be young in age,
but your heart is like a garbage can...

921
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:56,990
…as an older woman, your soul
as hot as paper...

922
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,290
…the more you think about it.

923
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,810
Did I say something?

924
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,480
He went to his mind, Hermione.
Not to say it wasn’t always mental…

925
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,230
…but now it’s in the spotlight
for all to see.

926
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,570
Wait.

927
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,660
- We better get this back.
- I'm not going back.

928
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:39,410
- Good. See you later.
- See you.

929
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:22,450
Harry Potter…

930
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:33,590
- Professor Trelawney...
- He'll be back tonight.

931
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,380
I'm sorry?

932
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:40,220
Tonight, he was the one who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:42,430
...will be forgiven.

934
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,850
Innocent blood will be shed...

935
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:51,020
…and servants and masters
they will meet again.

936
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,620
I'm really sorry, my dear.
Did you say something?

937
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,200
No.

938
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,200
Nothing.

939
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,840
I don’t believe they would kill
Buckbeak. It’s just awful.

940
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,760
- It's just too bad.
- Now What did I tell you? My father said…

941
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:09,100
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
Guess I'll give him the Gryffindors room.

942
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:11,730
This will be successful.

943
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:14,110
- Look who's here.
- Ah! Are you coming to see the show?

944
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:17,400
You! You are dirty, you hate,
bad little box!

945
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:19,320
Hermione, no!

946
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,160
He is not worth it.

947
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,300
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:42,720
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not in any sense, got it?

949
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:47,310
- That felt good.
- Not good, too smart.

950
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:11,040
Look at him. Loves the smell of wood
when the wind blows them.

951
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:13,500
Why don’t we just throw it away?

952
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,090
They would know it was me,
and then Dumbledore…

953
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:19,260
...would get into trouble.
He’s coming down, you know? Dumbledore.

954
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:21,800
He says he wants to be with me
when...

955
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,840
When it happens.

956
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,350
Very good man, Dumbledore.

957
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:28,890
A great man.

958
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:34,350
- We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
- You won't do that!

959
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,690
Imagine I want you to see
something like that? No.

960
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:41,530
Just drink your tea and leave.
Oh. Before you do, Ron…

961
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:51,330
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,210
- Keep a close eye on your pet, Ron.
- I think someone owes you an apology.

963
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:59,130
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let you know.

964
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,380
I meant it!

965
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:03,300
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,180
Hagrid!

967
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,440
Oh, crikey.

968
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,650
No, minister. In this way.

969
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:22,940
It's late. It’s almost dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:26,910
Someone will see you outside
at this hour of the night, you will have trouble.

971
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:30,660
Very you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,500
Quick. Quick!

973
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,420
Hagrid.

974
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:40,500
- It'll be fine. It's going to be fine.
- Go, go!

975
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:45,130
- That's the ling you see there...
- On the mountain.

976
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,970
- In the forest... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,850
- Good night.
- Minister. Make your own way.

978
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,890
- Have a cup of tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

979
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:59,560
- People.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:03,110
Well, I think we should go down
with our work, right?

981
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,860
Very good. That’s the decision
of the Committee for Disposition...

982
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:11,200
...of dangerous animals
of the Buckbeak hippogriff…

983
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:16,870
...hereinafter referred to as "the penalty,"
they will be killed at sunset.

984
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,590
- Brother, brother...
"Now, now, Hagrid." Now, come on.

985
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:25,170
- All right. Everything will be fine.
- The lock will send...

986
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,090
What is?

987
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,340
I thought I just saw...

988
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:31,640
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

989
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:39,060
Buckbeak didn't mean any harm.

990
01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:27,030
No.

991
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,160
He was teasing me. Scabbers.

992
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,710
Ron. Ron!

993
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:47,210
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

994
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:50,470
Wait!

995
01:27:56,390 --> 01:28:00,690
- Scabbers, bite me!
- Harry, do you know what tree this is?

996
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:03,150
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:08,820
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,030
It’s the Grim!

999
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,080
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:23,290
Harry!

1001
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,250
- Support!
- Ron!

1002
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:32,630
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1003
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,480
Come on!

1004
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,820
Move!

1005
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,620
Duck!

1006
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:36,780
Harry!

1007
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:55,680
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1008
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,760
- Where do you think this is going?
- I have an idea.

1009
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:01,810
I just hope I'm wrong.

1010
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:24,660
We’re at the Shrieking Shack,
No?

1011
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,370
Come on.

1012
01:30:37,720 --> 01: 30:39,140
Ron.

1013
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,310
- Ron. You're fine.
- The dog. Where is?

1014
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:45,730
Harry! It’s a light. He’s the dog.
He is an Animagus.

1015
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:02,410
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill me too!

1016
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:04,370
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,500
Then it will be you!

1018
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:14,880
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:17,920
Expelliarmus!

1020
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:25,810
Okay, okay, Sirius.
It looks pretty boring, doesn’t it?

1021
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:29,060
Finally, the meat
reveals the internal conflict.

1022
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:33,270
Well, you would know all about
the madness inside, isn't it Remus?

1023
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:44,740
- I found it.
- I know.

1024
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:46,200
- He is.
- I understand.

1025
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:49,580
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1026
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,750
And all this time,
you are his friend.

1027
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,510
He's a wolf!
That's why he doesn't go to class.

1028
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,010
How long have you known?

1029
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:05,720
- Because Professor Snape set the record straight.
- Well well well, Hermione.

1030
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:08,850
You are the most skilled wizard
of your age that I have never met.

1031
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:11,440
End of story, Remus!
Come on, let's kill it!

1032
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,270
- Wait!
- I did my job!

1033
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,860
Twelve years of that!

1034
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,860
To Azkaban!

1035
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:31,080
Very good. Kill him.

1036
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,420
But wait a minute more.
Harry has a right to know why.

1037
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,170
I know why.

1038
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:39,630
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,720
- You cause them to die!
- No, Harry, it wasn't him.

1040
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,800
Someone lied to your parents...

1041
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:48,470
…someone who, until recently,
I thought I was dead!

1042
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:52,140
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:55,440
And he lives in this room! Right now!

1044
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:58,900
Get out, get out, Peter!

1045
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:02,070
- Go out, go out and fight!
- Expelliarmus!

1046
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:07,530
Returns are sweet.

1047
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,950
Like I thought I would be the one
to arrest you.

1048
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,450
Severus...

1049
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:16,380
I told Dumbledore we were helping a
my old friend had been entering the castle and now here was the proof.

1050
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:17,880
Very well, Snape.

1051
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:22,420
Once again, you’ve put your best and most valuable mind to work
and how they always come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,300
Now if you’ll excuse me,
Remus and I have unfinished business...

1053
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:30,470
...to take care of yourself.
- Give me something. I'm asking you!

1054
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:33,230
"Severus, don't be an idiot."
- Can't help it. It’s a habit.

1055
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:35,020
- Stop.
- Stop yourself! Remus!

1056
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:37,610
You guys are arguing
like an elderly couple.

1057
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:40,320
Why don’t you jump in and play with
your chemistry is aligned!

1058
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,360
I could do it, you know.

1059
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:49,450
But why do we ignore the dementors?
They want to see you.

1060
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:52,330
Do I see a flash of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:56,000
It’s Dementor’s Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like to endure.

1062
01:33:56,170 --> 01:34:01,590
They say it’s almost unbearable
to swear, but I will do my best.

1063
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,050
Severus, please.

1064
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:07,090
Then about you.

1065
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:13,270
Expelliarmus!

1066
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:18,600
- Harry! What did you do?
- You shot a teacher!

1067
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:21,400
- Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.
- He was at school with us.

1068
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:23,230
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,400
- No. Pettigrew smiled. You killed him!
- No, no.

1070
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:29,780
I thought so too, until you mentioned
I see Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:32,790
- The map was fake, then.
- The map never lies!

1072
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:36,960
Pettigrew is alive!
And there he is!

1073
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:42,000
- Me?! He’s smart!
- Not you! Your dog!

1074
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:45,420
- Scabbers runs in my family...
- Twelve years?

1075
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:48,090
Longevity
for a garden mouse!

1076
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,850
- He's missing a leg, isn't he?
- What?

1077
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:53,970
- The only thing they could prove was that Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1078
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:57,440
A bad guy cut off his
then everyone would think he was dead.

1079
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,650
- And then he turned into a dog!
- Show me.

1080
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:06,320
- Give it up, Ron.
- What do you want to do with him?

1081
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:07,570
Scabbers!

1082
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:10,820
Leave it alone! Get off it!
What are you doing?

1083
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,140
Remus?

1084
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:37,390
Sirius.

1085
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,480
Old friends!

1086
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:48,950
Harry! Look at yourself.
You look a lot like your father.

1087
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:52,780
- That's right James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you talk to Harry!

1088
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:56,240
How would you describe James
forward!

1089
01:35:56,450 --> 01:36:01,670
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort! No?!
- I didn't mean to!

1090
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:04,670
The Dark Lord. You don’t know
the weapons it has!

1091
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,510
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you do?

1092
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:13,470
- What would you do?
- I'd rather die!,I'd rather die than betray my friends!

1093
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,020
Harry!, James wouldn’t
they killed me!

1094
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:23,900
Your father..your father would have saved me!
He would love me!

1095
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,570
I had to know Peter!, if Voldemort
they didn’t kill you, then we would have killed you. Together!

1096
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,820
No!

1097
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:36,280
- Harry, this man...
- I know about him.

1098
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:38,370
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:43,580
- Bless you, young man. May God bless you!
- Get down!

1100
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,130
I said we’ll take you to the castle.

1101
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,710
After,
the dementors can possess you.

1102
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:57,390
Sorry for the breakdown.
I think that’s too much.

1103
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,100
Kinda? Kinda?
He almost broke my leg!

1104
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:02,810
I would have gone for the dog.

1105
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:06,810
Usually, I have a very sweet
like a dog.

1106
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:12,240
In fact, more than once, James said
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:17,280
The backbone that I could live with.
Fleas, on the other hand, are deadly.

1108
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,340
Good.

1109
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:38,890
- You better go.
- No, No. Don’t worry, okay?

1110
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,470
All right. I'll stay.

1111
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:43,230
You go, I'll stay.

1112
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,650
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1113
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:51,230
- It's really sad.
- It's very painful.

1114
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,990
They can cut it.

1115
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:57,110
I know Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a moment.

1116
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:01,490
It's late. It’s destroyed.
They need to cut it down.

1117
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,580
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

1118
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:09,170
I’ll never forget the first time
I went through the doors.

1119
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:13,050
It would be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:18,010
That was an interesting
We did it there.

1121
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,970
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,310
Well, I didn’t think my father
would like those two best friends...

1123
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,020
...to become murderers.

1124
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:29,900
Also, deceased,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,440
You’re alive, you’re free.

1126
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,700
It makes me a farmer.
Everything but the dementors!

1127
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:39,240
Ron! Am I not a good friend, a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:41,910
...for the dementors, eh?
I was your dog!

1129
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,120
- Good girl, smart girl! You certainly won’t…
- Stay away from him!

1130
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:50,500
I don’t know if you know, Harry…

1131
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:54,760
…but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godmother.

1132
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,880
I know.

1133
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:02,100
I can understand if you choose
to spend time with your aunt and uncle…

1134
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:04,770
...but if you wanted to
another room...

1135
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:07,440
What is? Do you come and live with me?

1136
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:11,900
Well, just an idea.
I can understand if you don't like it.

1137
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:13,650
Harry!

1138
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:32,750
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your medicine tonight?

1139
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:39,430
You know the real man you are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly belong! This heart right here!

1140
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:42,760
This meat is just meat!

1141
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:46,020
Expelliarmus!

1142
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:57,650
Harry!

1143
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:01,700
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:10,250
Run! Run!

1145
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,300
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1146
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:27,560
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:29,980
Teacher?

1148
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:35,610
Professor Lupine?

1149
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,620
Good dog. Good dog!

1150
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:49,580
Here you go, Potter!

1151
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,410
Sirius!

1152
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,660
Get back here, Potter!

1153
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:34,890
Sirius!

1154
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:38,650
No. Sirius!

1155
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,400
Wait Patronum!

1156
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:38,580
Harry?

1157
01:45:39,490 --> 01:45:41,870
I saw my father.

1158
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,620
What is?

1159
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:45,370
He sent the traitors away.

1160
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:46,960
I saw him across the lake.

1161
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:48,790
Listen Harry, they've seen Sirius.

1162
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,840
Every minute the dementors
we’re going to do the Kiss.

1163
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:54,510
- You mean they'll kill him?
- No. That’s too bad.

1164
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,550
It’s too bad.

1165
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,100
They will take his soul.

1166
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:02,180
Boss, you need to stop them.

1167
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:05,730
- They got the bad guy.
- Yes sir. Sirius isn't wrong.

1168
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,110
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1169
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:09,650
He’s my dog, sir.

1170
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:13,860
It’s not really a dog. He was a dog.
It was my brother Percy's dog.

1171
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:17,740
- But then they gave him a dog...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:20,450
- Trust us.
"I'm sure, Miss Granger."

1173
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:26,080
But I’m sad to say that three 13 year olds
witches will inspire some others.

1174
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:31,960
The voice of a child,
however fair and accurate...

1175
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:35,880
...doesn't matter to the
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:43,640
Something unknown, time.

1177
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:46,140
Able...

1178
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:49,190
...and when involved with,
dangerous.

1179
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:54,400
Sirius Black is the top
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:57,320
You know the rules, Miss Granger.

1181
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:59,280
You don't deserve to be seen.

1182
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:03,120
And you would do well, I think,
to return before this final shot.

1183
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:06,830
Otherwise, the pressure
too scary to talk about.

1184
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:09,170
If you win tonight...

1185
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:12,170
…more of an innocent life
can be saved.

1186
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:16,220
Three layers should do it, I think.

1187
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,930
Oh, and ​with that.

1188
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:28,940
Upon reflection, I find research
my way to be a smart place to start.

1189
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:31,190
Good luck.

1190
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:34,150
The bloodiest
Is that all?

1191
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:37,150
Sorry, Ron, but I see
because you can't walk...

1192
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,770
What happened?

1193
01:48:07,930 --> 01:48:10,230
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1194
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:12,270
Where are we at 7:30?

1195
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,230
I do not know. Are you going to Hagrid’s house?

1196
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,780
Come on. And they can't see me.

1197
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:19,700
Hermione!

1198
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,550
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:45,930
Hermione, will you tell me
What are we doing?

1200
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:48,980
You are dirty, you hate,
bad little box!

1201
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:50,480
That’s us.

1202
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:53,600
Hermione, no! He is not worth it.

1203
01:48:53,810 --> 01:48:55,270
This is not true.

1204
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:59,940
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:02,320
McGonagall gave it to me the first year.

1206
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:05,830
This is how I have achieved
in my classroom all year long.

1207
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:09,250
- You mean we went back in time?
- Whether.

1208
01:49:09,410 --> 01:49:12,790
Dumbledore really wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:18,250
Obviously, something happened
He wants us to change.

1210
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,720
Good shot.

1211
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,390
Thank you.

1212
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:27,050
Malfoy came.

1213
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:30,310
- Run.
- Not in any sense, got it?

1214
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:33,850
I’ll take the gamble
dirty blood! Consider my words.

1215
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:37,940
- That felt good.
- Not good, too smart.

1216
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,900
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's house.

1217
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:03,590
Look. Buckbeak is still alive.

1218
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,930
Of course.

1219
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:09,100
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,310
If we win, more than a
they could save an innocent life.

1221
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,020
Let's go.

1222
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:38,420
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:41,090
Fudge needs to see Buckbeak
before we steal it.

1224
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:43,710
Otherwise, he’ll think Hagrid
throw it away.

1225
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,130
Scabbers, you live!

1226
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:50,100
- Keep a positive eye on your pet.
- It's Pettigrew.

1227
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:53,220
- Harry, you can't.
- Hermoine, He blamed my parents.

1228
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:56,390
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you should!

1229
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:02,980
Harry, you are currently at Hagrid's house.

1230
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:05,990
If you’re just going to hunt,
you will think you are crazy.

1231
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:09,030
Things That Happen to Witches
interfering with time, Harry.

1232
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:11,450
They can't see me.

1233
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,460
Fudge comes.

1234
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:19,460
And we’re not going?

1235
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:23,210
Why don't we go out?

1236
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:35,680
Are you angry?

1237
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:43,070
The pressure.

1238
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:44,610
I'm sorry.

1239
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:08,130
We go out the back door. Go!

1240
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,360
Is that really my hair
looks like the back?

1241
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:31,740
What is?

1242
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:34,450
I thought I just saw...

1243
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:37,330
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1244
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:53,930
Well, go ahead, Harry. Go!

1245
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:02,140
Run away. Get down.

1246
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:27,750
Minister, I really think
I have to sign it too.

1247
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:31,760
Yes, it's very good. It could be...

1248
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:35,760
Yes, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:42,940
Keep it up. Come on. Prompt.

1250
01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:49,110
Buckbeak. Good?
Prompt. Hurry up. Good?

1251
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:53,240
- Buy a car.
- It's a very common name...

1252
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:55,320
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:53:58,030 --> 01:54:01,000
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,500
Come pick up that beautiful dead dog.

1255
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:10,630
- Come on. Here it is. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, Minister. Follow me.

1256
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,510
- Now, look there.
- Towards?

1257
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:16,090
- Look away from the rocks.
- What should I look for?

1258
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:19,760
Professor Dippet had the word
he farmed when he was a student.

1259
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:22,770
- Oh, yes. Really, really.
- And all the strawberries.

1260
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:26,600
"Come on, Buckbeak." Come on.
- I don't see strawberries.

1261
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:27,940
- Over there.
- Towards?

1262
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:29,860
- Over there.
- This way.

1263
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:32,740
- Let's get this over with, please.
- All right.

1264
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,110
But where is it?

1265
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:39,240
I saw the monster, just now.

1266
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:42,080
- Nothing!
- That's great.

1267
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,580
Buckbeak.

1268
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:47,880
Oh come now, Dumbledore.
Someone has definitely released it.

1269
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:49,380
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1270
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:53,840
I do not think that the Minister is
you had something to do with this. Hagrid

1271
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:56,880
After all, how could it?
You are always with us.

1272
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:58,930
- Right.
- Okay, okay.

1273
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,640
We need to find the place.

1274
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:03,850
Well, search the sky,
if necessary, work on it.

1275
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:09,440
In the meantime, I’d love a good bowl
of tea or a big brandy.

1276
01:55:09,610 --> 01:55:13,610
Oh, executioner, your duty
it is no longer necessary.

1277
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:15,650
Thank you.

1278
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:19,160
You won’t find tiny chips
in this room, teacher.

1279
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,420
- Come on.
- This way.

1280
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:40,010
This way, now.

1281
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:44,180
- Now what?
- We're saving Sirius.

1282
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:46,890
- How?
- I don't know.

1283
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:58,570
- Look. That’s Lupin.
- Immobulus!

1284
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:07,000
And Snape came.

1285
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:14,880
And now we wait.

1286
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:17,880
And now we wait.

1287
01:56:45,450 --> 01:56:48,700
- Even if someone is having fun.
- Whether.

1288
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,290
- Hermione?
- Whether?

1289
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:57,800
First, down the coast,
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:00,090
...I did see someone.

1291
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:03,680
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,180
With a Patronus.

1293
01:57:05,350 --> 01:57:07,270
I heard Snape tell Dumbledore.

1294
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:08,890
According to him...

1295
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:12,480
…just a super-powered wizard
he could have done it.

1296
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:14,520
It was my father.

1297
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:17,440
My father made the Patronus.

1298
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:19,860
- Harry, but your father...
- Dead. I know.

1299
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,610
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,370
Here we come.

1301
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,420
Do you see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:40,420
- He asks me to come live with him.
- Very good.

1303
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:43,930
When we save, we never
We need to get back to the Dursleys.

1304
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:45,720
It would just be me and him.

1305
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:48,350
We can live in the country...

1306
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:51,140
...where you can see the sky.

1307
01:57:51,310 --> 01:57:54,150
I think he will like it later
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:56,730
Harry!

1309
01:57:58,270 --> 01:57:59,980
Run!

1310
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:08,410
Let's go.

1311
01:58:27,970 --> 01:58:30,310
- What are you doing?
- You're saving your life.

1312
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,940
Thank you.

1313
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:41,820
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
01:59:56,930 --> 01:59:58,690
That was terrifying.

1315
01:59:58,850 --> 02:00:01,810
Evil Professor Lupine
i had a rough night.

1316
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:16,370
Sirius. Come on!

1317
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:34,510
- This is terrible.
- Don't worry.

1318
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:37,890
My father is coming.
He will activate the Patronus.

1319
02:00:46,610 --> 02:00:48,440
Any minute now.

1320
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:50,700
There. You'll see.

1321
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:54,580
Harry, listen to me.
No one comes.

1322
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:57,290
Don’t worry, he will.
He's coming.

1323
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,880
- Sirius.
- Timikis...

1324
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,800
...you guys.

1325
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:11,590
Harry!

1326
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:17,390
Wait Patronum!

1327
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:17,580
You were right, Hermione.

1328
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:21,080
It wasn’t my father I saw at first.
It was me!

1329
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:24,000
I thought I was playing
the Patronus first.

1330
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,540
I knew I could do
this time because...

1331
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:28,420
...well, I already did.

1332
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:31,050
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1333
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:34,050
But I don’t like to fall…!

1334
02:02:47,190 --> 02:02:48,520
Bomb!

1335
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:24,640
I will forever be grateful for this...

1336
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:26,140
…you guys.

1337
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:29,230
- I want to go with you.
- One day, maybe.

1338
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:32,320
For a few days, my life
it’s very unpredictable.

1339
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,240
By the way...

1340
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:38,450
…you want to be here.
- But you're not wrong.

1341
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:40,740
And you know it.

1342
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:43,700
And for now, he will.

1343
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,580
I bet you’re tired of hearing this…

1344
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:52,130
...but you look a lot like your father.

1345
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:55,840
Just with your eyes.

1346
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,090
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1347
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:06,140
Too bad I had so much time
with James and Lily, and you're too young.

1348
02:04:06,730 --> 02:04:08,230
But know this.

1349
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:12,520
The ones who love us
it never really leaves us.

1350
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,860
And you can always find them…

1351
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:20,110
...here.

1352
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:33,040
You are truly the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:01,490
We have to go.

1354
02:05:29,770 --> 02:05:32,440
- Good?
- He's open. We did.

1355
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,150
What did you do?

1356
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:36,270
Good night.

1357
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:46,370
How did you get there?

1358
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:49,200
I mean I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:52,160
- What does it say, Harry?
- I do not know.

1360
02:05:52,330 --> 02:05:55,880
Sure, Ron. How does one
in two places at once?

1361
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:23,860
Good luck, Harry.

1362
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:29,330
I saw you coming.

1363
02:06:33,870 --> 02:06:36,580
This looked awful, trust me.

1364
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:42,470
- You've been fired.
- No.

1365
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:45,590
No. I stayed, of course.

1366
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,550
Did you stay? Why?

1367
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:53,020
Well, it seems that someone
let the fact of my illness pass.

1368
02:06:53,180 --> 02:06:58,690
This time tomorrow, the dogs start
will arrive and parents won't...

1369
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:02,240
...well, someone like me
they taught their children.

1370
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:04,360
- But Dumbledore...
- Dumbledore is...

1371
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:06,410
… I’ve struggled a lot on my behalf.

1372
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:09,830
Also, people like me...

1373
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:13,790
Well, let’s just say
which I have learned by now.

1374
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,930
Why are you so sad, Harry?

1375
02:07:26,090 --> 02:07:28,260
None of those things made any difference.

1376
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:31,970
- Pettigrew comparison.
- Didn't he do anything?

1377
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:35,640
Harry, it made all the difference in the world.
You helped bring the truth to light.

1378
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:38,310
You saved an innocent man
of a terrible tragedy.

1379
02:07:38,690 --> 02:07:41,190
It made a huge difference.

1380
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:48,030
If I’m proud of anything…

1381
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,870
... is about how much
you are studying this year.

1382
02:07:51,030 --> 02:07:53,790
Now, since I’m no longer alive
your teacher...

1383
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:58,210
...I don't know anything wrong
that I will give you this.

1384
02:07:59,130 ​​​ --> 02:08:01,630
So I'll say goodbye now, Harry.

1385
02:08:01,790 --> 02:08:04,380
I am sure we will meet again one day.

1386
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:06,260
Until then…

1387
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:09,300
…which he did wrong.

1388
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:47,760
Stop, I said! Or I'll take
upstairs if you don’t sit down.

1389
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,340
Harry.

1390
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:51,550
Where did you get it?

1391
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:54,140
“Can I go, Harry?”
After you, of course.

1392
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:56,470
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1393
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:59,940
Let the man pass.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:02,610
It was not properly sealed.
They made me do it.

1395
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:04,270
I didn’t do it.

1396
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:09,150
- It's a Firebolt.
- It is the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,860
For what?

1398
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:13,570
- But who sent it?
- Nobody knows.

1399
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:15,660
I came with him.

1400
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,170
"Go ahead, Harry!"
- Okay, let's see.

1401
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:24,170
How long, Harry?

1402
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,150
Lumos.

1403
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:47,730
I solemnly swear that I
until it’s not good enough.

1404
02:21:06,910 --> 02:21:08,710
Mistakes made.

1405
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:15,920
Nox…..


1
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,957
Bloody children.

2
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,600
That’s how you did it, Wormtail.

3
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,051
As I recall, you once called
the nearest building.

4
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:50,166
Can the job that will take care of me
has it become your source of stress?

5
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,285
No. No, no, Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,306
I just wanted to...

7
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,907
…maybe if we did
not with the boy.

8
00:02:57,992 --> 00:03:00,611
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:04,236
It cannot be done without Him.
And so it will be.

10
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,081
Just like I said.

11
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:09,293
I will not put you to shame, Lord.

12
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:10,868
Good.

13
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:14,088
First, gather our old friends.

14
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:15,874
Send them a proof.

15
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:31,937
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle guard...

16
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:35,046
...standing just outside the door.

17
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:40,944
Stop, Wormtail,
so I can greet our guest properly.

18
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,228
Avada Kedavra!

19
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,184
Harry.

20
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:51,634
Harry!

21
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,563
Are you okay?

22
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:57,778
Hermione. Bad dreams.

23
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,985
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

24
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,958
Night.

25
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,113
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

26
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:06,599
Bloody hell.

27
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,513
Seriously, get dressed.

28
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:10,958
And don't go back to sleep.

29
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,533
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says the food is ready!

30
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,686
- Ron, where exactly are we going?
- I don't know.

31
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,728
- It's okay, Dad. Where are we going?
- I don't have the darkest.

32
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:28,848
Keep it up!

33
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,431
Arthur!

34
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,035
It's about time, son.

35
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,213
Sorry, Amos.

36
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,973
Some of us got some sleep.

37
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:43,103
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.

38
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:45,586
He works with me at the Ministry.

39
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,210
And this boy hanging
It has to be Cedric, right?

40
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:50,246
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:51,793
This way.

42
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,503
Merlin’s head!
It must have been Harry Potter.

43
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,493
- Yes, sir.
- Very, very happy.

44
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:01,871
It’s a pleasure to meet you too, sir.

45
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,707
Yeah, it's just there.

46
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,082
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes.

47
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:13,023
We don't want to be late.

48
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:16,678
Come on. Almost there now.
Get in a good position.

49
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,531
Why are they all stopping?
the old man?

50
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,230
- That's not just any old man, my friend.
- It's a Portkey.

51
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,245
It’s time to go!

52
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:26,318
What is a Portkey?

53
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,095
- Smart! Then three. One, two…
- Harry!

54
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,260
...three!

55
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,108
Stop it, children!

56
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,487
- What is?
- Let!

57
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,608
I mean that cleared up your sinuses, right?

58
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:05,089
- Everything's wrong, as usual.
- Thank you.

59
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,564
Go ahead, check that out!

60
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:17,155
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

61
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:23,408
Stay together! Keep it up, girls!

62
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,114
Look!

63
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,475
Come on! Keep it up, girls!

64
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:37,408
Blimey!

65
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:39,776
Parting ways, I think, old chap.

66
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,265
- We'll see in the competition.
- See you.

67
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,103
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

68
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:44,391
See you later, Cedric.

69
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:50,618
Home sweet home.

70
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:54,098
What is?

71
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:04,113
- Very good, very good.
- Ginny, look!

72
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:05,613
- All in the bathroom.
- Look.

73
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:07,840
Ladies, pick a bed and pull it out.

74
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:11,368
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We are all hungry.

75
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:13,871
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Get off the table!

76
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:15,734
- Get off the table!
- Get off the table!

77
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,142
I love magic.

78
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:38,170
Get your Quidditch World Cup programs here!

79
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,297
Blimey, Dad. How far along are we?

80
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:43,537
Well, put it this way,

81
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,106
If it rains...

82
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,432
...you'll be the first to know.

83
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:50,914
My father and I are in the minister’s box…

84
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,693
…with an organization
by Cornelius Fudge himself.

85
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:56,525
Don't be so rude, Draco.

86
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,139
Not necessarily with these people.

87
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,253
Have fun, right?

88
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,749
When you can.

89
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:22,022
Come on. Take a seat.

90
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,208
I told you these chairs
We have to wait.

91
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,815
Come on!

92
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,650
It’s the Irish! There’s Troy!

93
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,428
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

94
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:41,383
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

95
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,414
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Whether!

96
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:56,263
Who is that?

97
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,564
That, sis, is the best detective
in the world.

98
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:05,653
Krum! Krum! Krum!

99
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:10,318
Krum! Krum! Krum!

100
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:11,613
Krum!

101
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,156
Whether!

102
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:23,099
Good night!

103
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:26,202
As Minister of Magic...

104
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:29,963
...gives me so much joy...

105
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:33,995
...to get
each and every one of you...

106
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:39,470
…until the end
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

107
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,470
Stop the fight...

108
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:43,959
...begin!

109
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,653
Krum! Krum! Krum!

110
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,163
There is no one like Krum.

111
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,941
- Krum?
- Stupid Krum?

112
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:06,470
He is like a bird,
as he goes up in the air.

113
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,338
- He's not just an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

114
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:11,605
He’s an artist.

115
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,960
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

116
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:15,803
Viktor, I love you

117
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:17,518
Viktor, I do

118
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:21,181
When we are
My heart beats just for you

119
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,509
Sounds like the Irish
they have their own magnificence.

120
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:25,190
Stop! Stop it!

121
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:27,553
It’s not the Irish.

122
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,978
We need to get out of here. Now!

123
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,841
Get out, it's Hell!

124
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,718
Back to the Portkey, everyone,
and stay together!

125
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:42,048
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

126
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:43,623
Go!

127
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:45,581
Harry!

128
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:03,313
- Keep it up, you lot!
- Harry!

129
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,866
Harry! Harry!

130
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:55,863
Morsmordre!

131
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:24,093
Harry!

132
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:28,813
- Where are you?
- Harry!

133
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,909
We’ve been looking for you for years!

134
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:35,329
I thought we lost you, buddy.

135
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:37,812
What is it?

136
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,126
Get lost!

137
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:45,142
Stop!

138
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:46,881
That's my son!

139
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:51,363
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, are you okay?
- We came back for Harry.

140
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:52,748
Which one of you created it?

141
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,849
- Stop, you can't...
- Don't lie!

142
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,173
They already know you
where the crime occurred.

143
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:59,468
- Crime?
- Barty! Just kids.

144
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:00,855
What crime?

145
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,355
It's the Dark Mark, Harry.
That’s his brand.

146
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,191
What, Voldemort?

147
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:10,188
The crowd tonight, with their hair,
they’re his too, aren’t they?

148
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,695
- His followers?
- Whether.

149
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:13,751
Food of death.

150
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:18,463
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

151
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:20,767
There!

152
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:23,060
Everyone, this road!

153
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:25,544
A man, Harry?

154
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:27,228
Subject?

155
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,191
I do not know.

156
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,022
I didn't see his face.

157
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,085
What about the cart?

158
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,211
What about the cart?

159
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,858
What about the stroller, my friends?

160
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,297
Drooble package…

161
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,433
…and a licorice stick.

162
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,748
Second thought, just the Drooble's.

163
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,082
- That's fine, I'll take it. Don't worry.
- Only from Drooble. Thank you.

164
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,941
Two pumpkin pies, please.

165
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:25,018
Thank you.

166
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,705
What’s sweet to you, my friend?

167
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:30,749
No, I’m not hungry. Thank you.

168
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,518
What about the cart?

169
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:35,776
This is very bad.

170
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,305
How can the Ministry
you don’t know who made it?

171
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:41,778
Was there no security or…?

172
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:43,878
A lot, according to my father.

173
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,032
That's what they were so worried about.
It passed under their noses.

174
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:53,852
It hurts again, doesn’t it?
Your middle.

175
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:55,942
I'm fine.

176
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:00,834
You know Sirius will
I’d love to hear about this…

177
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,901
…what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

178
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,500
Hedwig. There we go.

179
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,028
Open the track!

180
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:06,298
Well, there is something
you don’t see it every day.

181
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:35,350
Well, now we’re all settled and ready,
I want to make an announcement.

182
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,878
This government will not only be
home this year...

183
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,985
…but the homes of some
tourists are also important.

184
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:46,603
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen…

185
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:48,836
Yes, what is it?

186
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,288
What is that?

187
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,749
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

188
00:16:56,533 --> 00:17:02,300
So, Hogwarts has chosen
to create a special event.

189
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:04,713
The Triwizard Tournament.

190
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:07,303
- Now, for those of you who don't know...
- Bright.

191
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:10,586
…the Triwizard Tournament
combines three schools...

192
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,987
…for a series of magic contests.

193
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:16,452
In each school, one student
chosen to fight.

194
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,441
Now let me say something.

195
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,498
If you are selected, you stand alone.

196
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,747
And trust me when I say…

197
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:26,405
…this fight is not
for the faint of heart.

198
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:28,749
But then more on that.

199
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,607
For now, join me in welcoming...

200
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:35,677
…the beautiful women of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

201
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,021
…and their teacher,
Madame Maxime.

202
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:53,700
Bloody hell.

203
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:04,183
Blimey. That’s a great woman.

204
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:28,217
And now our friends from the north.

205
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:31,152
Say hello to the proud boys
of Durmstrang...

206
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:34,027
…and their master,
Igor Karkaroff.

207
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:58,588
Oh, it’s Krum!

208
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,308
Blimey, he is!

209
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:01,795
Victor Krum!

210
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,923
Albus.

211
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:13,986
Igor.

212
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,154
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

213
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,686
- they will need to be protected.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

214
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,684
Our guardian, Hagrid,
it is more than can see them.

215
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:40,731
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid…

216
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:43,743
…they only drink single malt whiskey.

217
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,954
You're a fool!

218
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,348
Listen, please!

219
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,783
I want to say a few words.

220
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:06,708
Eternal glory.

221
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:11,135
It is the expectation of the student
winner of the Triwizard Tournament.

222
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,426
But to do this, the student
it has to cope with three tasks.

223
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:20,135
Three dangerous jobs.

224
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:21,608
- Evil.
- Evil.

225
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:25,332
In this regard, the Ministry saw fit
to establish a new system.

226
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,488
To sum this all up…

227
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,969
…we have the Department Head
of International Magical Cooperation…

228
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,711
…Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

229
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:50,434
Bloody hell. It’s Mad-Eye Moody.

230
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,501
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

231
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,211
Dark-wizard catcher.

232
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,477
Part of the Azkaban cells
full of it.

233
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:01,442
He must be crazy as a hat,
however, at this point.

234
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,107
- Old friend, thank you for coming.
- Poor quality ceiling.

235
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:19,007
Thank you.

236
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:27,303
What does it smell like,
do you think?

237
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:29,977
I don’t know, but I don’t think
it’s pumpkin juice.

238
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:39,366
After careful consideration...

239
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:42,709
…the Ministry said,
for their safety...

240
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:45,825
…no student under the age of 17…

241
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,565
…they will be allowed to upload their
it’s called the Triwizard Tournament.

242
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,222
- This decision is final.
- That's garbage!

243
00:21:52,307 --> 00:21:54,992
That’s garbage!
You don't know what you're doing!

244
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:58,495
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about it, then.

245
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,250
The Goblet of Fire.

246
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:24,388
Anyone who wants to join
in the competition...

247
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,354
…I just need to write their names down
on a piece of paper...

248
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:30,903
…and throw it in the fire first
this time on Thursday night.

249
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:33,964
Don't do it lightly.

250
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:37,411
If you choose, there’s no going back.

251
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:42,442
As of today,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

252
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:10,681
Alastor Moody.

253
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,691
Ex-Auror...

254
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:18,356
...Ministry is bad...

255
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,958
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

256
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:25,733
I am here at Dumbledore's request.
End of story, goodbye, end.

257
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:27,646
What questions?

258
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,343
When it comes to the Dark Arts…

259
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:36,598
…I believe it’s a practical idea.

260
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:42,577
But first, can any of you tell me
How many unforgivable curses are there?

261
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:45,970
- Yes, sir.
- And what are their names?

262
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:47,751
Because they are unforgivable.

263
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:49,608
The work of one of them...

264
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:53,674
Gets you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, right.

265
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,750
The Ministry says you’re too young
to see what these curses do.

266
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,017
I'm saying something else!

267
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:00,421
You need to know what you have!

268
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,075
You have to be prepared.

269
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:04,761
You should look elsewhere
to add your gum...

270
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:07,122
…at the bottom of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

271
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:08,409
No way.

272
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:10,564
The old man can see
the back of his head.

273
00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:13,423
And hear it in every classroom!

274
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:18,640
So, which curse will we look at first?

275
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,475
- Weasley!
- Whether?

276
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:21,610
Stop.

277
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:26,422
Give me a curse.

278
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:31,198
Well, my dad told me about one.

279
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:33,107
The Imperius curse.

280
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:36,442
Oh, yes, your father
would know all about it.

281
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:39,465
Gave the Ministry a little trouble
a few years ago.

282
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:42,493
Maybe I’ll show you why.

283
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,110
Hello.

284
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:54,546
Good cute baby.

285
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,123
Engorgio.

286
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:01,519
Empire!

287
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:08,119
Don't worry. It doesn't do anything wrong.

288
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,073
If he takes...

289
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:18,226
...he kills.

290
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:22,557
What are you laughing at?

291
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:25,262
Get down!

292
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:29,475
Clever, isn’t it?

293
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,529
What should I do next?
Go out the window?

294
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,474
Will it drown itself?

295
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,937
Many witches and wizards
suggest...

296
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:55,266
…which they just did
You-Know-Who's selling...

297
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,648
...which rules
of the Imperius Curse.

298
00:25:58,733 --> 00:25:59,827
But here’s the twist…

299
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,521
How do we categorize fraudsters?

300
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:07,405
Another, another.

301
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:10,050
Up, up. Come on.

302
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:11,726
Longbottom, right?

303
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:13,799
Up.

304
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:20,303
Professor Sprout tells me
you have a background in herbology.

305
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:23,459
There’s the…

306
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,134
The Cruciatus Curse.

307
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:28,583
Right, right. Come on, come on.

308
00:26:29,313 --> 00:26:30,556
It’s too bad.

309
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,469
The pressure.

310
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:38,548
Crucious!

311
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:52,661
Stop it!

312
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:55,031
Don't you see that he's worried?
Stop it!

313
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:16,481
Can you give us the last
Unforgivable curse, Mrs. Granger.

314
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:20,264
No?

315
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:23,087
Avada Kedavra!

316
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:29,205
The deadly confusion.

317
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:32,966
Only one person is known
that I am saved...

318
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:35,832
...and he's sitting in this room.

319
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:09,597
Pretty cool, isn’t it?

320
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:11,873
Very clever, yes,

321
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,333
and dangerous to be in
same room as...

322
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:15,957
…but he actually went there, you know?

323
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,605
He is so evil in her own eyes.

324
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,172
There’s a reason why the curse
they cannot forgive.

325
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,090
To make them in a classroom...

326
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:24,126
I mean, are you Neville’s face?

327
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:28,594
Neville?

328
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:30,122
Icons?

329
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:32,022
Are you okay?

330
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,335
Come on. We’ll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

331
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:53,173
We’ll be done!

332
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,991
Hi, Cedric. Put it down!

333
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:27,405
Eternal glory. Be smart, right?

334
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,233
Three years later,
when we are old enough to be elected.

335
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:31,824
Yes, better you than me.

336
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,484
Whether!

337
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,354
Thank you, thank you.

338
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,551
- Well, boys, we're done.
- I cooked just this morning.

339
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,503
It won't work.

340
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,013
- Oh, yeah?
"And why is that, Granger?"

341
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,623
Do you see this? This is an Age Line.

342
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:52,487
Dumbledore himself drew it.

343
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:53,698
So?

344
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:59,677
So, a genius like Dumbledore
he couldn't be fooled...

345
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:02,779
… with a challenge as a negative
as an anti-aging drug.

346
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:06,471
- But that's why it's so beautiful.
- Because it's terrible.

347
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,617
- Are you ready, Fred?
- It's ready, George.

348
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,153
- Bottom up.
- Bottom up.

349
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:18,323
- Whether!
- Whether!

350
00:30:19,044 --> 00:30:20,038
Whether!

351
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:22,745
Whether!

352
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,741
Smart?

353
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:30,297
- Whether!
- Whether!

354
00:30:39,343 --> 00:30:40,786
- You said it!
- You said it!

355
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:45,725
- Oh, no, you want a piece of me?
- I'll rip your nose off!

356
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,320
- Now you're kissing me.
- Take this! Come on!

357
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:51,293
Struggle! Struggle! Struggle!

358
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:56,790
You're "old school," aren't you?

359
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,407
Yes, but you look great!

360
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:32,818
Sit down. Please.

361
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,999
Now is the time
you were all waiting.

362
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:41,525
The selection of success.

363
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:16,395
The Durmstrang champion is Viktor Krum.

364
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:35,003
The triumph of Beauxbatons…

365
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,251
...by Fleur Delacour.

366
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:50,733
The Triumph of Hogwarts, Cedric Diggory!

367
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,580
Excellent!

368
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:05,231
We now have three competitors.

369
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:09,641
But in the end,
the same will go down in history.

370
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:13,605
Only one stop
this is the food of warriors...

371
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:16,192
…this victory ship…

372
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:18,399
…the Triwizard Cup!

373
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:51,117
Harry Potter.

374
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:55,054
Harry Potter?

375
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,304
Nope. Nope.

376
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:03,988
Harry Potter!

377
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:05,128
Go, Harry.

378
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:07,163
Harry, for goodness sake.

379
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:40,526
He's a fraud!

380
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:43,070
She’s not even 17 yet!

381
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:14,994
- Not good, I tell you!
- It's French tart.

382
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,150
- It's all a conspiracy theory!
- Quiet! I can’t imagine!

383
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:20,299
- It's all a conspiracy theory!
- I'm fighting.

384
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,637
- Harry.
- I contradict myself!

385
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,677
Harry, did you sign up
in the Goblet of Fire?

386
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:26,088
- No, sir.
- Did you ask any of the senior teachers...

387
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:27,513
…to be done to you?
- No, sir.

388
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:30,087
- You know so much?
- Whether. Yes, sir.

389
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,224
- But he's definitely lying.
- It is!

390
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:35,815
The Goblet of Fire is an interesting
things that are very strong.

391
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,973
Just a very strong
Confundus Charm could fool him.

392
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,108
Magic is far beyond the talents
of about four years.

393
00:35:41,193 --> 00:35:44,473
You seem to have given this
Great idea, Mad-Eye.

394
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:47,864
Once upon a time it was my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff

395
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:49,357
you may remember.

396
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:51,183
This isn't going to work for you, Alastor.

397
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:54,258
Keep this to yourself, Barty.

398
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:57,793
The rules are simple.

399
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:03,070
The Goblet of Fire creates
an important decision.

400
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,746
Mr. Potter has no choice.

401
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:10,499
He, like tonight...

402
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,845
...a Triwizard triumph.

403
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,850
This can't be happening, Albus.

404
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:47,175
First the Dark Mark. Is it safe?

405
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:49,083
What do you think, Minerva?

406
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:52,145
Turn it off.

407
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,267
Don't let Potter fight.

408
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:57,764
You heard Barty. The rules are excellent.

409
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,253
Well, the devil with Barty and his government.

410
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:03,673
And when you did
will the Ministry agree?

411
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:07,828
Sir, I, too, know that it is difficult
to believe this is the same thing.

412
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:11,973
However, if we really want to find
what does this mean…

413
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:15,266
…maybe you should,
at the moment...

414
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,617
…let them talk.

415
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:20,994
What is...? “You don’t do anything?”

416
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,047
Offer it as bait?

417
00:37:24,012 --> 00:37:26,899
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

418
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:28,793
I know.

419
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,513
With Severus.

420
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:33,509
Alastor, look at Harry, won't you?

421
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:36,489
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

422
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,997
He must be very worried about being...

423
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:42,177
...knows the future.

424
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,729
After all, we all are.

425
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:02,134
How did you do it?

426
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,620
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

427
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:09,002
I could let
your best friend knows better, though.

428
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,067
- Say what?
- You know very well what.

429
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:14,980
I didn’t ask for this to happen, Ron.

430
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:16,372
Good?

431
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,592
- You're shocked.
- Yes, that's me.

432
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,619
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter’s goofy friend.

433
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:29,322
I didn't put my name on the box.

434
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:32,249
I don't want to be respected forever.
I just want to be...

435
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:37,602
Look, I don’t know
what happened tonight...

436
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:39,087
...and I don't know why.

437
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,018
He just did it.

438
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:42,814
Good?

439
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:53,400
Get angry.

440
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:11,153
What an amazing quartet.

441
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:13,845
Hello.

442
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:17,524
I’m Rita Skeeter.

443
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:20,572
I write for the "Diary Prophet".

444
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,028
But you certainly know that, don’t you?

445
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,743
It's you we don't know.

446
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,294
You are the best answer.

447
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:32,815
Hidden Quirks
under the rosy cheeks?

448
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:36,757
What mystery is covered by these muscles?

449
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:40,052
Is there strength beneath the surface?

450
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:42,801
In a nutshell, what makes a winner?

451
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,557
"Me, me and me" you want to know.

452
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:47,500
I don’t have to tell my readers.

453
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:50,210
So, who feels like giving them away?

454
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:56,372
Shall we start with the youngest?
Cute.

455
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,905
This is very good.

456
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,623
It’s a layer.

457
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,854
So, you should feel right at home.

458
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,921
Don’t worry if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, huh?

459
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:19,649
No.

460
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:22,081
So, tell me, Harry.

461
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,843
Here you sit, a 12-year-old boy…

462
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:27,496
I’m 14. Sorry.

463
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:30,643
Ready to fight
with three students...

464
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,040
…not just so much
it’s more ingrained in your mind than you are…

465
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:36,853
…but those who already know words
that you wouldn’t try…

466
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,746
…in your wildest vision.

467
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:41,089
Concerned?

468
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,846
I do not know.
I haven’t really thought about that.

469
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,298
Just ignore the pen.

470
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,953
Then, of course,
you’re not a 12-year-old boy, are you?

471
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:53,023
- Nineteen.
- The plot of your story.

472
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,618
Do you think it was
the pain you suffered...

473
00:40:56,703 --> 00:40:59,987
… what made you so eager to get in
a dangerous attack?

474
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:01,794
No, I didn't get in.

475
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,048
Of course you didn’t.

476
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:07,664
Everyone loves a warrior, Harry.

477
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:11,178
Squeeze the end.

478
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:14,662
Speaking of your parents,
were alive...

479
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,483
…how do you think they would feel?

480
00:41:16,568 --> 00:41:17,416
Proud?

481
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,563
Or are you worried…

482
00:41:18,648 --> 00:41:22,204
…which your mind shows, at best,
a tragedy that needs attention...

483
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,499
…at worst, a psychotic death?

484
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,397
Hey, my eyes don’t
"shining with the ghosts of my past."

485
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,968
Harry, I couldn't send Hedwig away.

486
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,241
At the start of the World Cup, the Ministry
i've trapped lots and lots of cats...

487
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,119
…and he’s very easily recognizable.

488
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,511
We need to talk, Harry, in person.

489
00:42:14,913 --> 00:42:19,055
Meet in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

490
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,614
And try to be alone.

491
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:22,113
Sirius.

492
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:24,147
PS

493
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,882
The bird barked.

494
00:42:36,683 --> 00:42:37,717
Sirius?

495
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:57,173
Harry Potter, age 12…

496
00:42:57,258 --> 00:43:00,043
…faith entering
in the Triwizard Tournament.

497
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:02,493
His eyes are rolling
with the demons of the past...

498
00:43:02,578 --> 00:43:04,047
...and I wipe away his tears...

499
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:22,532
Sirius. How...?

500
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:25,505
I don't have much time, Harry,
so let me go straight.

501
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,285
Did you or didn’t you sign up
in the Goblet of Fire?

502
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,308
No!

503
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:31,903
I had to ask.

504
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:34,716
Now, tell me about your dream.

505
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,915
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

506
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,287
But who was the third person in the room?

507
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,075
- I do not know.
- Haven't you heard a name?

508
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,917
No.

509
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:49,133
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something very important.

510
00:43:49,218 --> 00:43:50,518
And what was that?

511
00:43:52,628 --> 00:43:53,797
He wanted to...

512
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:55,530
...me.

513
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,261
I don’t know why.

514
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:00,298
But he wanted to use this guy
to get to me.

515
00:44:02,594 --> 00:44:04,517
But, I mean, it was just a dream, right?

516
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:06,322
Whether.

517
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:07,980
Just a dream.

518
00:44:09,262 --> 00:44:10,285
Look, Harry.

519
00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:14,071
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name coming out of the cup...

520
00:44:14,156 --> 00:44:15,557
…this is no coincidence.

521
00:44:15,642 --> 00:44:17,892
Hogwarts is no longer safe.

522
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:19,573
What are you saying?

523
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,697
I say the demons
they are inside the wall.

524
00:44:22,782 --> 00:44:24,143
Igor Karkaroff?

525
00:44:24,232 --> 00:44:25,366
He was a death eater.

526
00:44:25,648 --> 00:44:28,878
And no one, no one stops
it is a death eater.

527
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:31,478
Then there’s Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.

528
00:44:31,563 --> 00:44:33,862
He sent his son to Azkaban.

529
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,990
You think one of them
put my name on the cup?

530
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:43,276
I don’t know who put your name
in the cup, Harry…

531
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,187
…but whoever did it isn’t your friend.

532
00:44:45,272 --> 00:44:47,669
People die in this war.

533
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:50,834
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

534
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:57,109
- Someone's coming.
- Take care of your friends, Harry.

535
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,512
- Who were you talking to?
- What is?

536
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:05,036
- Who says I was talking to someone?
- I heard voices.

537
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:06,814
You can imagine things.

538
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:08,873
It won’t be the first time.

539
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,525
Maybe you’re just learning
for the next review, I hope.

540
00:45:39,243 --> 00:45:40,236
Amazing.

541
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,969
- Amazing!
- Neville. You’ve done it again.

542
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:48,062
Yes, forgive me.

543
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,218
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

544
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:55,112
Moody gave it to me.
We had tea that day.

545
00:45:57,412 --> 00:45:58,929
A lot of people have come through.

546
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:01,101
Why don’t you just go
and talk to yourself?

547
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:05,025
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

548
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,625
What do you want me to say again?

549
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:08,313
Go.

550
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:15,846
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him…

551
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:20,148
… what Dean told Parvati
that Hagrid is looking for you.

552
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:22,189
How about that? Good...

553
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:23,752
What is?

554
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:30,955
- You know you're not going to do this?
- Do it.

555
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:37,378
Dean told Parvati that…

556
00:46:39,098 --> 00:46:40,768
Please don’t ask me to say it again.

557
00:46:41,553 --> 00:46:43,030
Hagrid finds you.

558
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:46,040
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not a dog!

559
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,264
Did you bring your father's clothes?
like I asked you?

560
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:02,148
Yes, I brought the dress.
Hagrid, where are we going?

561
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:03,399
You’ll see soon enough.

562
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,472
Now be careful, this is important.

563
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:08,957
What does the flower have?

564
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:12,125
Hagrid, are you cutting your hair?

565
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,362
So, I’ve done it.

566
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,377
You might want to try the same
now and again.

567
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:28,045
Hagrid?

568
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,667
The mantle! Put the clothes on!

569
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:41,755
Good evening , Olympe.

570
00:47:42,414 --> 00:47:43,692
Oh, Hagrid.

571
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:46,093
I thought you might not come.

572
00:47:46,704 --> 00:47:50,003
I thought you might have forgotten me.

573
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,710
I couldn’t forget you, Olympe.

574
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,321
What did you want to show us?

575
00:47:57,003 --> 00:47:59,667
When we spoke earlier, we sounded like…

576
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:01,851
...excited.

577
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:04,800
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

578
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:17,309
Can we get closer?

579
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:26,627
Dragons?

580
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:28,863
Is that the first job?

581
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:31,284
- You're playing.
"Come on, Harry."

582
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,016
This is true
animals that don’t understand.

583
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,736
Oh, crikey!

584
00:48:38,228 --> 00:48:40,692
However, I have to say…

585
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:43,288
...the Horntail is one of the worst
a piece of work.

586
00:48:43,994 --> 00:48:46,399
Poor Ron almost passed out
you just see it, you know it.

587
00:48:48,213 --> 00:48:50,300
- Was Ron here?
- Oh, of course.

588
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,454
His brother Charlie contributed
to import from Romania.

589
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:55,513
Didn’t Ron tell you that?”

590
00:48:57,473 --> 00:48:58,467
No, no.

591
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:00,792
He didn’t tell me anything.

592
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:13,994
- You're kidding, Potter.
- You're a joke, Potter.

593
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,519
- Goodbye, Potter.
- Potter is so sweet!

594
00:49:18,604 --> 00:49:21,090
- Cedric commands.
- Thank you.

595
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,633
How about the badge?

596
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,037
Excuse me.

597
00:49:30,644 --> 00:49:31,690
Harry.

598
00:49:32,897 --> 00:49:34,817
Hey! Read the scene, Potter!

599
00:49:34,902 --> 00:49:35,858
Can I have a comment?

600
00:49:37,393 --> 00:49:39,877
- All right.
"You're kidding, Potter!"

601
00:49:39,962 --> 00:49:42,038
- Alfarero, you're crazy!
- Harry Potter stinks!

602
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:47,210
Dragons. That’s the first task.

603
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:50,303
- They have one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

604
00:49:50,983 --> 00:49:52,359
Are you serious?

605
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:57,061
And Fleur and Krum, right...?

606
00:49:57,146 --> 00:49:59,274
- Whether.
- Come on, Ced, stop.

607
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,879
- Right.
- It's not worth it.

608
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,258
"Read the badges, Potter!"
- Listen. About the badges.

609
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:05,889
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

610
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:09,376
Not like I try
to store things, same.

611
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:11,588
It just happens for a while.

612
00:50:11,673 --> 00:50:14,099
You have to accept, though,
fire is so much fun.

613
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:16,628
You’re a straight man, you know that?

614
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:18,549
- What do you think?
- I know.

615
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:20,427
What else?

616
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,510
- Whether. Get away from me.
- Good.

617
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,724
- There's Potter. Cheat.
"Why are you so worried, Potter?"

618
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:33,008
Dad and I have a bet, you see.

619
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:36,202
I don’t think you’ll last
10 minutes into this fight.

620
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,603
He doesn’t get it.
He thinks you won’t last five.

621
00:50:42,688 --> 00:50:45,764
I don't know
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

622
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:49,989
It’s ugly and ugly.
And you're just kind.

623
00:50:51,696 --> 00:50:53,666
- Exciting?
- Oh, no, you don't, son!

624
00:50:56,343 --> 00:50:58,520
I will teach you to curse someone
when their tails are turned!

625
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:03,248
You’re sweaty, you’re scared, you’re crazy…

626
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,013
- Professor Moody!
- ...back-shooting...

627
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,475
What are you doing?

628
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,153
Study.

629
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,741
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

630
00:51:19,348 --> 00:51:20,631
Stand up! Stand up!

631
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,218
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a challenge?

632
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:36,318
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a challenge?

633
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:37,416
Master!

634
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:42,098
I could tell you stories about your father
that would cut right down to your soft hair!

635
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:44,537
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

636
00:51:45,174 --> 00:51:48,904
We never use transformations
as a punishment!

637
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:50,819
Of course Dumbledore told you that.

638
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:52,986
Maybe he said it.

639
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:55,769
Well, you’ll do well to remember.

640
00:51:57,243 --> 00:51:58,131
Out!

641
00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:03,630
You. Come with me.

642
00:52:39,283 --> 00:52:40,965
It’s a Foe-Glass.

643
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,914
Let me take care of my enemies.

644
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:48,298
If I can see their white eyes,
standing behind me.

645
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:55,383
I wouldn’t mind telling you
that is there.

646
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,899
You wouldn't believe me if I did.

647
00:52:58,123 --> 00:52:59,043
Now...

648
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:03,617
...what to do
of your dragon?

649
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,913
Well, you know, I was just wondering…

650
00:53:12,103 --> 00:53:12,961
Sit.

651
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,726
Listen to me, Potter.

652
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:20,990
Your friend Diggory?

653
00:53:21,277 --> 00:53:25,114
At your age, he could trade a whistle for
a clock and have it tick the clock for you.

654
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:27,913
Mrs. Delacour?

655
00:53:28,323 --> 00:53:30,988
She is a fairy princess just like me.

656
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:35,017
As for Krum, the head
it can be filled with holes...

657
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:37,072
...but Karkaroff's is not.

658
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:38,756
They will have an idea.

659
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,104
And you can get paid for it
will play to Krum’s strengths.

660
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,109
Come on, Potter.

661
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:50,981
What are your strengths?

662
00:53:53,306 --> 00:53:54,346
I do not know.

663
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:57,439
Well, I can dance.
I mean, I’m a good athlete. But that...

664
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,287
Better than right, as I heard.

665
00:53:59,832 --> 00:54:01,153
But we are not allowed a broom.

666
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,117
You have a tree.

667
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,477
Bets! Place your bets!

668
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:15,998
Bets held! Bets are being made here!

669
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:19,097
Hold on, guys! Who wants a lightning bolt
in the current bloodline?

670
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:21,497
Smart money is on Krum to survive!
What bets?

671
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,235
Yes, sir?

672
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:26,431
Ten to one for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

673
00:54:27,303 --> 00:54:28,894
Listen, please.

674
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,789
This is a great day for all of us.

675
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:39,323
Each of the three functions implements
very high risk.

676
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,338
Rest throughout the day.

677
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:45,587
This will reduce the risk of
they can identify you.

678
00:54:45,672 --> 00:54:48,435
- Harry? Is that you?
- Whether.

679
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:51,078
I’m sure we all love our champions…

680
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,919
- How are you feeling? Good?
- ...the great luck.

681
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,885
The most important thing is to be prepared.
Then, you just have to…

682
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,047
Fight a dragon.

683
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:08,464
Young love.

684
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:10,585
How...

685
00:55:13,183 --> 00:55:14,213
...you smile.

686
00:55:17,143 --> 00:55:20,311
If everything goes wrong today...

687
00:55:20,396 --> 00:55:22,620
...you guys can
create the first page.

688
00:55:23,443 --> 00:55:25,570
You have nothing here.

689
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,910
This tent is for champions…

690
00:55:28,193 --> 00:55:29,534
…and my friends.

691
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:36,648
Nothing. We got what we wanted.

692
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,833
Good day, competitors.
Get together, please.

693
00:55:42,918 --> 00:55:47,163
Right now, you’re waiting, thinking,
and then the day came.

694
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:50,457
Somehow just the four of you
can totally appreciate it.

695
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:52,039
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

696
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,891
Excuse me, I'll just go.

697
00:55:55,976 --> 00:55:57,324
Barty, the bag.

698
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:59,857
Champions, in a circle around me.

699
00:56:00,258 --> 00:56:02,790
Mrs. Delacour, here. Mr. Krum.

700
00:56:03,645 --> 00:56:06,768
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, here.
That's true. Now...

701
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:09,638
...Lady Delacour, if you please.

702
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:15,573
The Welsh Green.

703
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:21,599
Mr. Krum.

704
00:56:24,873 --> 00:56:26,442
The Chinese fire.

705
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:35,101
The unusual Swede.

706
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,218
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

707
00:56:38,303 --> 00:56:40,002
- What is it, boy?
- Nothing.

708
00:56:43,912 --> 00:56:46,265
The Hungarian Horntail.

709
00:56:48,563 --> 00:56:51,693
This represents four real dragons…

710
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:54,906
…each of the previously assigned
a golden bird for safety.

711
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,760
The goal is simple.

712
00:56:57,485 --> 00:56:58,732
Collect the blood.

713
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:02,498
This is what you need to do,
because every flavor has a symbol...

714
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:05,555
…which you can’t trust
to move on to the next task.

715
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,235
What questions?

716
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:11,291
Very good. Good luck, champions.

717
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:13,538
Mr. Diggory, in the voice of the cannon,
try...

718
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:26,733
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

719
00:57:38,283 --> 00:57:41,194
Three of our competitors
now they're facing their dragons...

720
00:57:41,706 --> 00:57:44,998
…and therefore each of them
move on to the next project.

721
00:57:45,472 --> 00:57:48,660
And now our fourth and final contestant.

722
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:54,553
Harry! Harry! Harry!

723
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,680
Harry! Harry! Harry!

724
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:04,681
Your wand, Harry! Your tree!

725
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:06,620
Accio Firebolt!

726
00:59:36,113 --> 00:59:38,273
- Whether!
- Whether!

727
00:59:47,138 --> 00:59:48,161
Oh, no.

728
00:59:58,253 --> 01:00:01,616
- Whether!
- Whether! Well done, dragon!

729
01:02:33,573 --> 01:02:35,204
Whether! Whether!

730
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:57,325
Yes, Harry!

731
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:01,726
- Yes, Harry!
"I knew you weren't going to die, Harry." Lose a limb.

732
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,696
- That's it.
- Put it on everyone?

733
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,827
- Never!
- Never!

734
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:08,685
Stop!

735
01:03:09,555 --> 01:03:11,666
Go, Harry. What is the sign?

736
01:03:13,283 --> 01:03:16,162
- Who wants me to open it?
- Whether!

737
01:03:16,896 --> 01:03:20,222
- Do you want me to open it?
- Whether!

738
01:03:30,688 --> 01:03:32,451
What the fuck was that?

739
01:03:37,183 --> 01:03:39,692
Okay, everyone!
Go back to the drawing board.

740
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:43,161
This is going to be awful
it’s not all you depressed people you hear.

741
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,774
I think you have to play because
put your name in the Goblet of Fire.

742
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:54,330
You’ve got it, haven’t you?
It took you a long time.

743
01:03:55,702 --> 01:03:57,214
I wasn’t the only one
what he thought you did.

744
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,489
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

745
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,751
Bright.
That makes me feel so much better.

746
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:08,106
I just warned you about the dragon.

747
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,877
Hagrid warned me about the dragon.

748
01:04:09,963 --> 01:04:11,463
No, no, no, I did.

749
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:12,992
No, don’t you remember?

750
01:04:13,464 --> 01:04:14,757
I told Hermione to let you know…

751
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:17,918
…what Seamus told me about Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

752
01:04:18,968 --> 01:04:22,352
Seamus never told me anything,
so it really was me the whole time.

753
01:04:24,023 --> 01:04:26,487
I thought we’d be fine, you know….

754
01:04:27,319 --> 01:04:28,564
…after you figured that out.

755
01:04:29,406 --> 01:04:31,696
Subject...?
Who could have known that?

756
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,346
It’s completely mental.

757
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:36,727
Whether. Isn't that right?

758
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:39,320
I think I was a little worried.

759
01:04:42,373 --> 01:04:43,359
Young people.

760
01:05:08,523 --> 01:05:09,585
- It's okay, Harry.
- It's okay, Harry.

761
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,688
Cho, Harry is looking at you.

762
01:05:20,153 --> 01:05:21,236
Shut up.

763
01:05:22,488 --> 01:05:23,742
Look at this!

764
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:27,808
I can't believe it! He’s doing it again.

765
01:05:29,528 --> 01:05:31,788
"Miss Granger, a poor but ambitious girl..."

766
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:34,480
"...seems to be growing a taste
for famous witches."

767
01:05:34,655 --> 01:05:36,949
"His last shot, sources say..."

768
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:40,306
“…nothing other than
Bonbon Bulgarian, Viktor Krum."

769
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,524
"No word yet on how Harry Potter
I’ll take this new challenge.”

770
01:05:46,473 --> 01:05:47,998
A package for you, Mr. Weasley.

771
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,834
Thanks, Nigel.

772
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:56,011
Now, Nigel.

773
01:05:57,007 --> 01:05:57,912
Later.

774
01:05:59,525 --> 01:06:00,361
Go away.

775
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,679
I told him I would get Harry’s autograph.

776
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:13,163
Look, my mom sent me something.

777
01:06:21,382 --> 01:06:23,005
My mom sent me a dress.

778
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,460
Well, it’s certainly the same with your eyes.
Is there a coat?

779
01:06:27,603 --> 01:06:29,092
Hush, Harry.

780
01:06:29,973 --> 01:06:33,598
- Ginny, this should be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's terrible.

781
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:36,778
What do you do?

782
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,090
They're not for Ginny.

783
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:40,574
They are for you.

784
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:45,507
- Wear clothes.
- What about clothes? Why?

785
01:06:47,122 --> 01:06:48,605
The Yule Ball…

786
01:06:49,493 --> 01:06:54,208
…it’s been a lesson
of the Triwizard Tournament…

787
01:06:55,543 --> 01:06:57,203
…in the beginning.

788
01:06:58,293 --> 01:07:01,942
On Christmas Eve,
us and our guests...

789
01:07:02,343 --> 01:07:03,926
...will meet in the Great Hall...

790
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:07,918
…for a night of good vibes.

791
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:12,098
As representatives of the host school...

792
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:17,465
…I look forward to each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

793
01:07:17,692 --> 01:07:19,949
And I mean this, because...

794
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:24,707
…the Yule Ball is, first and foremost…

795
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:26,984
...a song.

796
01:07:31,453 --> 01:07:32,685
Silence!

797
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:36,538
Ichaj Godric Gryffindor
he commands the respect...

798
01:07:36,623 --> 01:07:39,132
...from the Wizarding World
almost 10 centuries.

799
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:43,357
I won’t have you, in a
overnight, ruining the reputation...

800
01:07:43,442 --> 01:07:47,401
... by behaving like a speaker,
baboon racing.

801
01:07:48,702 --> 01:07:50,638
Say that five times fast, right?

802
01:07:50,723 --> 01:07:52,082
Now, to play...

803
01:07:52,306 --> 01:07:55,332
…is allowing the body to breathe.

804
01:07:56,235 --> 01:07:59,663
In each girl,
a swan is secretly sleeping...

805
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:02,190
... wants to blow up
and run away.

806
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:04,136
Something is about to explode
by Eloise Midgen,

807
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,716
but I don’t think it’s a swan.

808
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,662
In each boy,
a great lion preparing to pounce.

809
01:08:09,747 --> 01:08:12,038
- Mr. Weasley.
- Whether?

810
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:13,860
Will you join me, please?

811
01:08:19,174 --> 01:08:22,756
Now, put your right hand on my shoulder.

812
01:08:22,972 --> 01:08:25,191
- Towards?
- My middle.

813
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:27,797
And stretch out your hand.

814
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,431
Mr. Filch, if you please.

815
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:35,723
One, two, three.

816
01:08:35,808 --> 01:08:39,789
One, two, three. One, two, three.

817
01:08:43,175 --> 01:08:45,004
You’re never going to let him forget this, are you?

818
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:46,260
- Never.
- Never.

819
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:50,173
Everyone should come together.
Boys, get on your feet!

820
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,719
Why should they travel in groups?

821
01:09:15,804 --> 01:09:17,690
How should you get a
themselves to ask?

822
01:09:26,313 --> 01:09:29,823
Blimey, Harry. You've killed dragons.
If you can’t find a date, who can?

823
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:31,632
I think I’ll take the dragon for now.

824
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,815
I’m looking for my mother.

825
01:09:40,163 --> 01:09:43,941
Even though I didn't know it well.
She left when I was about three years old.

826
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:46,261
No, not the mother thing, her.

827
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:50,049
It broke my father’s heart, though.
He was a baby, my father.

828
01:09:50,194 --> 01:09:51,960
I could have picked him up when he was 6

829
01:09:52,045 --> 01:09:53,743
with one hand
and placed it on the pedestal.

830
01:09:54,915 --> 01:09:56,650
He laughed out loud at that.

831
01:09:59,223 --> 01:10:00,299
It’s so beautiful.

832
01:10:07,023 --> 01:10:10,079
And then he died
when I started studying, so...

833
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,283
So, I had to make
myself, anyway.

834
01:10:14,403 --> 01:10:16,623
But that’s about me. What about you?

835
01:10:33,913 --> 01:10:35,099
This is very bad.

836
01:10:35,184 --> 01:10:37,039
At this rate, we will be the
same at our age

837
01:10:37,124 --> 01:10:38,156
they don’t have time.

838
01:10:40,977 --> 01:10:43,529
Well, us and Neville.

839
01:10:44,072 --> 01:10:46,135
Yes, but, then again,
he can handle it himself.

840
01:10:47,582 --> 01:10:49,880
You might be interested to know
that Neville already has someone.

841
01:10:53,323 --> 01:10:55,118
Now, I'm really worried.

842
01:11:00,913 --> 01:11:03,403
"Sit down or all the best
go."

843
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:07,909
Who are you going with, then?

844
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,843
- Hey, Angelina?
- What is?

845
01:11:12,928 --> 01:11:17,840
Do you want to come to the game with me?”

846
01:11:18,898 --> 01:11:20,019
On the ball?

847
01:11:20,553 --> 01:11:21,648
Yeah, good.

848
01:11:25,707 --> 01:11:26,790
Hey, Hermione.

849
01:11:27,433 --> 01:11:28,369
You are a girl.

850
01:11:29,273 --> 01:11:30,435
It looks great.

851
01:11:30,725 --> 01:11:31,669
Are you coming with one of us?

852
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,026
Come on. Something for a Man
to reveal itself.

853
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,692
For a girl, it’s just sad.

854
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,952
I will not go alone because,
believe it or not, someone has asked me!

855
01:11:52,753 --> 01:11:54,245
And I said yes!

856
01:11:56,498 --> 01:11:57,801
Bloody hell.

857
01:11:58,267 --> 01:11:59,375
He’s lying, isn’t he?

858
01:12:00,223 --> 01:12:01,388
If you say so.

859
01:12:02,143 --> 01:12:05,227
See, you just need
click and do it.

860
01:12:05,728 --> 01:12:07,605
Tonight, when we return
in the conference room...

861
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,496
...we'll both have friends. Do you want to?

862
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,521
Nixelia.

863
01:12:35,257 --> 01:12:36,683
- Cho!
- Harry!

864
01:12:40,598 --> 01:12:43,081
Watch out for the stairs.
It’s a little chilly at the top.

865
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,451
Well, thank you.

866
01:12:49,473 --> 01:12:50,491
Cho?

867
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:52,326
Whether?

868
01:12:54,393 --> 01:12:56,468
Well, I was just wondering if you...

869
01:12:56,553 --> 01:12:58,741
I was wondering if you can
you wanted to come to the game with me.

870
01:13:01,283 --> 01:13:02,940
Sorry, I didn’t realize that.

871
01:13:04,453 --> 01:13:08,958
I was just wondering if you can
you wanted to come to the game with me.

872
01:13:15,373 --> 01:13:16,405
Harry...

873
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:19,352
…I’m sorry, but someone
he asked me.

874
01:13:20,794 --> 01:13:21,720
And...

875
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:25,937
Yes, I've said I'll go with him.

876
01:13:28,046 --> 01:13:30,541
Good. Whether. Great.

877
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:33,984
Good. No problem.

878
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:36,042
Good. Good.

879
01:13:37,943 --> 01:13:38,799
Harry?

880
01:13:40,356 --> 01:13:41,316
It's true...

881
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,102
...I'm sorry.

882
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:55,078
All right, Ron.

883
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:57,723
No problem, Ron. It's all good.
It doesn't matter.

884
01:13:58,469 --> 01:13:59,543
What happened to you?

885
01:14:00,673 --> 01:14:02,291
He simply asked Fleur Delacour to leave.

886
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:03,660
What is?

887
01:14:04,217 --> 01:14:05,232
What did he say?

888
01:14:05,673 --> 01:14:06,899
No, really.

889
01:14:08,593 --> 01:14:11,431
- He said yes?
- Don't be mistaken.

890
01:14:12,298 --> 01:14:14,039
There it was, walking.

891
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:16,643
You know how I like it when they walk.

892
01:14:17,523 --> 01:14:20,601
I couldn’t stop.
It just kind of came out.

893
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:24,254
Yeah, he kind of yelled at her.
It was a little scary.

894
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:29,494
- And what did you do next?
- What else? I ran for it.

895
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,601
I'm not crazy for this, Harry.
I don’t know what happened to me.

896
01:14:33,686 --> 01:14:34,774
- It's okay, Harry.
- It's okay, Harry.

897
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:37,727
I always enjoyed watching them
from the back.

898
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:41,505
He will never forgive me, ever.

899
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:43,633
Hey!

900
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,005
Bloody hell.

901
01:15:04,704 --> 01:15:05,998
Bloody hell.

902
01:15:09,842 --> 01:15:10,676
These...

903
01:15:11,238 --> 01:15:12,528
Oh, the blood…

904
01:15:16,357 --> 01:15:19,118
What is that? What is that?

905
01:15:19,203 --> 01:15:21,804
- The clothes.
- Well, everyone is fine!

906
01:15:22,296 --> 01:15:24,790
No laces. There isn’t a pill.

907
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:27,532
Well, I think yours is more traditional.

908
01:15:27,617 --> 01:15:29,897
Traditional? It's been a long time!

909
01:15:30,669 --> 01:15:32,327
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

910
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:37,539
I feel like my Great Aunt Tessie.

911
01:15:42,726 --> 01:15:44,179
Kill me, Harry.

912
01:15:45,952 --> 01:15:47,116
Leave it alone!

913
01:15:48,613 --> 01:15:49,786
Poor baby.

914
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:52,117
I think he’s in his room alone,
she cries her eyes out.

915
01:15:52,203 --> 01:15:54,863
- Subject?
- Hermione, of course.

916
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:58,248
Come on, Harry, why do you think he
won't you tell me who she's coming with?

917
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,587
Because we would take the mickey out of it
if he did.

918
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,223
No one asked.

919
01:16:03,223 --> 01:16:05,960
I would personally take it if
he wasn’t too proud.

920
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:08,274
- All right, boys.
- All right, boys.

921
01:16:08,688 --> 01:16:09,766
You don't see...

922
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,124
...dashing.

923
01:16:12,888 --> 01:16:15,568
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

924
01:16:16,143 --> 01:16:18,238
- Are you ready, Professor?
- To play.

925
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,136
That’s what
the three winners...

926
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,522
Well, in this case, four.
They are the first to play.

927
01:16:22,733 --> 01:16:25,241
- I actually told you that.
- No.

928
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:27,209
Well, now you know.

929
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:33,377
Thus, Mr. Weasley, you can continue
in the main house with Miss Patil.

930
01:16:33,768 --> 01:16:35,982
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

931
01:16:36,067 --> 01:16:37,227
Come this way.

932
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:44,114
Oh, come on.

933
01:16:45,253 --> 01:16:47,499
- Hello.
- Now, you all need to get in line...

934
01:16:47,584 --> 01:16:48,965
...in the procession, please.

935
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,752
Oh, how wrong you are!

936
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:55,089
This way. This way. Come on.

937
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:58,803
It looks beautiful!

938
01:16:59,556 --> 01:17:00,676
Yes, he does.

939
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:51,512
Is that Hermione Granger?
And Viktor Krum?

940
01:17:52,693 --> 01:17:55,136
No. Nothing.

941
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:00,799
Hello!

942
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:12,134
Harry, take my leg off.

943
01:18:13,113 --> 01:18:14,180
- What is?
- Now!

944
01:19:21,085 --> 01:19:22,821
Are you ready?

945
01:19:23,653 --> 01:19:26,070
Move your body like a hairy troll

946
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:29,127
I am learning to sing and dance

947
01:19:29,353 --> 01:19:32,026
Come back like a crazy elf

948
01:19:32,663 --> 01:19:34,971
Plays solo

949
01:19:35,213 --> 01:19:38,107
Boogie like a unicorn

950
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:40,962
Don't get up until morning

951
01:19:41,212 --> 01:19:44,032
Put your hands in the air

952
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:46,971
Like an insignificant ogre

953
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:50,459
Can you play as a hippogriff?

954
01:19:52,694 --> 01:19:54,311
Ruddy pumpkinhead, right?

955
01:19:57,397 --> 01:19:59,793
I don’t think it was the book
which led to a trip to the library.

956
01:20:02,414 --> 01:20:03,686
Can I have your hand?

957
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:06,693
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

958
01:20:32,765 --> 01:20:33,903
Hot, isn’t it?

959
01:20:35,175 --> 01:20:38,101
Viktor left to go get drinks.
Would you like to join us?

960
01:20:38,653 --> 01:20:41,677
No, we wouldn’t want to hang out with you and Viktor.

961
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:45,653
What keeps your tree in one piece?

962
01:20:46,653 --> 01:20:48,044
He is the Durmstrang.

963
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:49,983
You interact with the enemy.

964
01:20:50,354 --> 01:20:51,352
The enemy?

965
01:20:52,564 --> 01:20:54,349
Who wanted his autograph?

966
01:20:54,793 --> 01:20:57,046
Again, all those things
that the struggle is...

967
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:00,422
…international support…

968
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:02,955
...to become friends.

969
01:21:03,753 --> 01:21:06,127
I think he has a little more
and not love in his mind.

970
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:18,707
Are you going to ask me to dance or not?

971
01:21:19,269 --> 01:21:20,221
No.

972
01:21:28,523 --> 01:21:31,424
- He's using you.
- How confident are you?

973
01:21:31,702 --> 01:21:33,581
Plus, I can take care of myself.

974
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:35,825
I don't know. He is very old.

975
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:38,522
What is? What is? Do you think so?

976
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:39,733
Yes, I think so.

977
01:21:39,818 --> 01:21:41,755
Then you know the solution, right?

978
01:21:42,173 --> 01:21:43,058
Go away.

979
01:21:43,324 --> 01:21:44,386
Next time there will be a ball

980
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:47,467
be brave and ask me
before someone else does!

981
01:21:47,552 --> 01:21:49,465
And not as a last resort.

982
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:53,663
Well, that’s… I mean,
that’s just plain wrong.

983
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:55,223
Harry.

984
01:21:56,013 --> 01:21:57,127
Where have you been?

985
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,219
Never mind! Go to sleep, you guys.

986
01:22:02,813 --> 01:22:06,648
- They get scared as they get older.
- Ron, you ruined everything!

987
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:08,124
What does this mean?

988
01:22:13,163 --> 01:22:16,015
No, don't let

989
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:22,216
This magic is dead

990
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:26,635
The answer is there

991
01:23:25,143 --> 01:23:26,727
Let me see it again.

992
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:31,258
Yes, the time is near now.

993
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,014
Harry, finally!

994
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:44,533
Stop, Wormtail,
so I can greet our guest properly.

995
01:23:55,223 --> 01:23:56,526
Are you okay, Harry?

996
01:23:58,093 --> 01:23:59,278
I just walked in.

997
01:24:00,473 --> 01:24:01,531
Me.

998
01:24:12,983 --> 01:24:15,856
Harry, you told me
You knew the blood a few weeks ago.

999
01:24:16,364 --> 01:24:18,255
The job is two days from now.

1000
01:24:18,389 --> 01:24:19,975
Really? I didn’t know.

1001
01:24:22,248 --> 01:24:24,038
I think Viktor's
I’ve tried it.

1002
01:24:24,123 --> 01:24:26,223
I wouldn’t know. Not really
talking about the struggle.

1003
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:32,054
In fact, we don’t really talk at all.
Viktor is a wonderful person.

1004
01:24:36,418 --> 01:24:39,094
I just want to say that he doesn’t
he talks a lot.

1005
01:24:40,016 --> 01:24:41,682
Usually, he watches me practice.

1006
01:24:43,223 --> 01:24:44,667
In fact, it’s a little disappointing.

1007
01:24:46,683 --> 01:24:48,622
Trying to find out about this bloodline,
don't you?

1008
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:51,480
What does that mean?

1009
01:24:52,313 --> 01:24:54,566
It just means this function
designed to test you...

1010
01:24:55,483 --> 01:24:56,581
…in the worst possible way.

1011
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:58,012
It’s almost annoying.

1012
01:24:59,823 --> 01:25:00,697
And...

1013
01:25:03,783 --> 01:25:04,967
...I'm afraid for you.

1014
01:25:06,623 --> 01:25:08,591
You defeat the dragons with nerve.

1015
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,636
I don’t know if it will
to be enough this time.

1016
01:25:12,503 --> 01:25:13,420
Hey, Potter!

1017
01:25:19,923 --> 01:25:21,438
- Potter!
- Cedric.

1018
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:25,185
How...? How are you?

1019
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:27,801
Amusing.

1020
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,763
Look, I know it’s never really
thank you very much

1021
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:33,595
for telling me about the dragon.

1022
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,666
Forget about it.

1023
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,254
I bet you would
they did the same for me.

1024
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,212
Exactly.

1025
01:25:39,113 --> 01:25:41,479
You know the Prefects bathroom
on the fifth floor?

1026
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,537
Not a bad place to take a shower.

1027
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,286
Just take your blood and...

1028
01:25:53,036 --> 01:25:55,096
…think of the hot water.

1029
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,167
I need to get out of my mind.

1030
01:26:43,423 --> 01:26:44,907
I'm really confused.

1031
01:26:48,263 --> 01:26:51,258
I would try putting it in water
if I were you.

1032
01:26:51,723 --> 01:26:52,708
Myrtle!

1033
01:26:53,527 --> 01:26:54,664
Good luck, Harry.

1034
01:26:55,987 --> 01:26:58,756
Long time no see.

1035
01:27:03,696 --> 01:27:07,501
I walked into a blocked pool
the next time...

1036
01:27:07,586 --> 01:27:10,887
…and I could say I saw some
of Polyjuice Potion.

1037
01:27:11,242 --> 01:27:13,658
I won’t be a bad boy anymore,
you, Harry?

1038
01:27:13,743 --> 01:27:14,973
Polyjuice Potion?

1039
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,138
I broke the habit.

1040
01:27:17,223 --> 01:27:20,373
Myrtle, you said?
"Try putting it in water"?

1041
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,690
That's what he did.

1042
01:27:29,534 --> 01:27:30,835
The other boy...

1043
01:27:32,628 --> 01:27:34,256
…the beautiful…

1044
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:37,343
...Cedridge.

1045
01:27:40,653 --> 01:27:43,142
Well, go ahead. Open it.

1046
01:27:51,493 --> 01:27:56,517
Come find us where our voice is heard

1047
01:27:56,602 --> 01:28:01,276
We can’t play above ground

1048
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:06,002
It will take an hour to see

1049
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:11,199
To return the imported

1050
01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:20,320
Myrtle...

1051
01:28:22,353 --> 01:28:25,173
…there are no people
on the Black Lake, is there?

1052
01:28:26,606 --> 01:28:28,272
Very good.

1053
01:28:29,212 --> 01:28:33,331
It took Cedric years to figure it out.

1054
01:28:34,123 --> 01:28:37,429
Almost all of the bubbles were gone.

1055
01:28:55,544 --> 01:28:56,841
Harry, tell me again.

1056
01:28:59,088 --> 01:29:01,874
"Come and find us where our voice is heard."

1057
01:29:02,113 --> 01:29:04,386
The Black Lake, it seems.

1058
01:29:05,733 --> 01:29:07,716
"We'll have to see about an hour."

1059
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:09,586
Again, of course.

1060
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:11,962
However, of course,
which can be problematic.

1061
01:29:13,283 --> 01:29:14,845
"Could it be problematic"?

1062
01:29:15,106 --> 01:29:18,320
When you finally hold your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1063
01:29:19,123 --> 01:29:23,497
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can relate.

1064
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:25,776
I don’t want to break the seam.

1065
01:29:26,102 --> 01:29:28,223
Professor McGonagall
he would love to see you in his office.

1066
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,570
Not you, Potter,
except for Weasley and Granger.

1067
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:33,629
But, sir, the second act
just a few hours away, and...

1068
01:29:33,714 --> 01:29:34,562
Exactly.

1069
01:29:34,647 --> 01:29:36,492
Maybe Potter is ready enough now

1070
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:38,502
and could do with a good night’s sleep.

1071
01:29:38,683 --> 01:29:40,381
Go. Now!

1072
01:29:51,233 --> 01:29:52,094
Longbottom!

1073
01:29:53,149 --> 01:29:55,236
Why don't you support Potter
putting his book back down.

1074
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:06,166
You know,
if you want to know the age...

1075
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,833
... you'd be better off with
"Goshawk's Guide to Herbology".

1076
01:30:09,328 --> 01:30:13,732
Did you know there is a witch doctor in Nepal
who plants trees that can't withstand gravity?

1077
01:30:13,817 --> 01:30:17,703
Neville, don't get mad,
but I really don't care...

1078
01:30:18,236 --> 01:30:19,212
...of years.

1079
01:30:20,298 --> 01:30:21,436
Now, if there is a...

1080
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,645
…Tibetan turnip that will allow me

1081
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:28,019
to cool off underwater
an hour later is much better.

1082
01:30:28,997 --> 01:30:29,840
But if not...

1083
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:33,047
I don’t know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1084
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:37,052
- What bets? What bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1085
01:30:37,913 --> 01:30:39,533
Hold on, my friends! Don't be shy.

1086
01:30:39,618 --> 01:30:40,848
- Three boys.
- A woman.

1087
01:30:40,933 --> 01:30:42,640
- Four down.
- But four out?

1088
01:30:43,352 --> 01:30:44,405
Don't be so mean.

1089
01:30:45,678 --> 01:30:47,515
- What bets?
- Fleur 10-1.

1090
01:30:49,748 --> 01:30:51,538
"Do you know about this, Neville?"
- Absolutely.

1091
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:53,526
- For an hour?
- Try.

1092
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,813
Is it very possible?

1093
01:30:55,638 --> 01:30:57,848
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1094
01:30:57,933 --> 01:31:00,331
…like the effects of salt water
instead of salt water...

1095
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:03,100
Are you telling me this now?
You must be kidding!

1096
01:31:03,185 --> 01:31:05,175
I just wanted to help.

1097
01:31:05,523 --> 01:31:07,857
Well, that makes you a better prospect
better than Ron and Hermione.

1098
01:31:08,739 --> 01:31:10,112
Where are they?

1099
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:13,008
- You seem a little worried, Harry.
- I?

1100
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:22,779
Welcome to the second task.

1101
01:31:23,203 --> 01:31:26,514
Last night, something was stolen
of each of our competitors.

1102
01:31:26,994 --> 01:31:28,313
A treasure trove of things.

1103
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:31,360
These four gems,
one for each test...

1104
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,658
...now lie down on the floor
of Black Lake.

1105
01:31:34,174 --> 01:31:35,413
To win...

1106
01:31:35,498 --> 01:31:39,422
…each test only needs to find
their treasure and return to the land.

1107
01:31:39,798 --> 01:31:42,521
- It's just too easy, just for this.
- Put that in your mouth.

1108
01:31:42,606 --> 01:31:46,243
They'll only have an hour to do it.
and only an hour.

1109
01:31:46,519 --> 01:31:50,487
Eventually, they will be alone.
There is no magic that will save them.

1110
01:31:50,976 --> 01:31:53,258
You can start with the sound of the cannon.

1111
01:32:19,803 --> 01:32:22,668
- What happened to him?
- I don't know, I can't see.

1112
01:32:24,016 --> 01:32:26,868
Oh, my God!
I killed Harry Potter.

1113
01:32:28,879 --> 01:32:30,709
Whether!

1114
01:32:31,983 --> 01:32:32,945
What is?

1115
01:33:53,183 --> 01:33:55,389
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour…

1116
01:33:55,474 --> 01:33:58,006
...too bad
they forced me to take a break...

1117
01:33:58,609 --> 01:34:01,005
... so it won't do anything else
in this work.

1118
01:35:19,563 --> 01:35:21,150
But he’s also my friend!

1119
01:35:22,896 --> 01:35:24,211
Same!

1120
01:36:16,073 --> 01:36:17,401
Let’s go downstairs.

1121
01:36:28,003 --> 01:36:30,889
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1122
01:37:27,876 --> 01:37:29,245
Whether!

1123
01:37:48,139 --> 01:37:49,918
Up!

1124
01:37:55,463 --> 01:37:56,542
Harry!

1125
01:37:59,544 --> 01:38:00,482
He's fine.

1126
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,153
He's fine. Barty!

1127
01:38:03,763 --> 01:38:04,993
Go get another towel.

1128
01:38:05,078 --> 01:38:07,136
I want all the judges here right now!

1129
01:38:07,773 --> 01:38:11,266
You saved him, though
it wasn’t yours to save.

1130
01:38:11,943 --> 01:38:13,353
My little sister.

1131
01:38:14,023 --> 01:38:15,049
Thank you.

1132
01:38:16,403 --> 01:38:18,517
And you! You helped.

1133
01:38:19,608 --> 01:38:21,813
Well, yes, somewhat.

1134
01:38:28,219 --> 01:38:29,331
Thank you.

1135
01:38:29,828 --> 01:38:31,119
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1136
01:38:31,204 --> 01:38:33,307
Are you okay? You have to be cold.

1137
01:38:35,022 --> 01:38:37,014
I think
You behaved well.

1138
01:38:37,343 --> 01:38:39,040
I'm done, Hermione.

1139
01:38:40,223 --> 01:38:44,041
After the last.
Fleur had never met the Grindylows.

1140
01:38:44,126 --> 01:38:47,556
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1141
01:38:47,933 --> 01:38:49,996
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1142
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,689
Attention!

1143
01:38:56,065 --> 01:38:59,919
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1144
01:39:00,488 --> 01:39:03,732
…which revealed innate control
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1145
01:39:04,278 --> 01:39:06,948
However, you see as Mr. Potter
before it would end...

1146
01:39:07,033 --> 01:39:11,812
…if it wasn’t for the fact that he was preoccupied with
to save not only Mr. Weasley…

1147
01:39:11,897 --> 01:39:15,852
…but the others too,
we’re committed to giving it a shot…

1148
01:39:16,485 --> 01:39:17,881
…second place…

1149
01:39:18,813 --> 01:39:20,338
- Second place!
- Well done!

1150
01:39:20,423 --> 01:39:22,933
…for good moral fibre!

1151
01:39:24,343 --> 01:39:25,890
Whether!

1152
01:39:29,473 --> 01:39:31,263
- Right.
- All that moral fiber, right?

1153
01:39:31,348 --> 01:39:33,022
- Very good.
- Moral fiber?

1154
01:39:33,107 --> 01:39:35,445
Blimey. Even when you mess up,
comes out right.

1155
01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:38,148
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Thank you, Potter.

1156
01:39:38,523 --> 01:39:40,210
- A good victory.
- Thank you.

1157
01:39:40,295 --> 01:39:41,176
Well done, young man.

1158
01:39:42,073 --> 01:39:44,908
- See you at Hagrid, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't talked.

1159
01:39:45,443 --> 01:39:49,502
After all, your story is a
I’ve heard it many times.

1160
01:39:50,493 --> 01:39:51,637
It’s really beautiful.

1161
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:53,429
It’s sad, really…

1162
01:39:54,123 --> 01:39:55,630
…to lose one’s family.

1163
01:39:58,077 --> 01:39:59,637
It’s never whole again, is it?

1164
01:40:02,388 --> 01:40:04,286
Still, life goes on...

1165
01:40:05,303 --> 01:40:06,428
…and here we stop.

1166
01:40:09,893 --> 01:40:12,563
I bet your parents would be
I'm so proud of you, Potter.

1167
01:40:12,648 --> 01:40:13,762
Barthemius!

1168
01:40:14,393 --> 01:40:18,124
I don’t want to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry summer internships, right?

1169
01:40:18,497 --> 01:40:21,210
The last boy to enter the
Department of Mysteries never came out!

1170
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:35,702
And they say I'm angry.

1171
01:40:45,553 --> 01:40:48,746
Now, I remember…
I remember when I first met you all.

1172
01:40:49,347 --> 01:40:52,363
Big Bad Organization
I always wear glasses.

1173
01:40:52,973 --> 01:40:54,857
Let’s hope you remind me a little of me.

1174
01:40:55,426 --> 01:40:58,172
And here we all are, four years later.

1175
01:40:58,513 --> 01:40:59,857
We’re still a bunch of shit.

1176
01:40:59,942 --> 01:41:02,607
Well, maybe,
but we all have each other.

1177
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:04,474
And Harry, of course.

1178
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:10,082
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion like never before!

1179
01:41:10,569 --> 01:41:11,717
Good!

1180
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:16,772
Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1181
01:41:16,857 --> 01:41:19,472
Teach me something, please

1182
01:41:29,354 --> 01:41:30,487
Mr. Crouch?

1183
01:41:38,063 --> 01:41:39,845
A man died here, Fudge.

1184
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:41,776
And he won't be the last.
You have to do something.

1185
01:41:41,868 --> 01:41:43,241
I won’t do it.

1186
01:41:43,455 --> 01:41:44,682
At times like this,

1187
01:41:44,767 --> 01:41:47,769
the wizarding world sees in
leaders with power, Dumbledore!

1188
01:41:47,854 --> 01:41:49,053
Then show them some at once!

1189
01:41:49,138 --> 01:41:51,577
The Triwizard Tournament
it won’t end.

1190
01:41:51,662 --> 01:41:53,554
They won't think I'm a fool!

1191
01:41:53,639 --> 01:41:56,601
A truly good leader does the right thing;
regardless of what others think.

1192
01:41:56,686 --> 01:41:57,801
What did you say?

1193
01:41:57,886 --> 01:41:59,522
- What did you tell me?
- Excuse me, guys.

1194
01:41:59,784 --> 01:42:02,697
You might be interested to know
this statement is no longer isolated.

1195
01:42:07,923 --> 01:42:08,920
Oh, Harry!

1196
01:42:09,555 --> 01:42:11,725
Harry, it’s so good to see you again.

1197
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,388
I can come later, Master.

1198
01:42:14,473 --> 01:42:15,518
You don't have to, Harry.

1199
01:42:15,603 --> 01:42:17,951
The Minister and I have finished.
I’ll be back in a moment.

1200
01:42:18,036 --> 01:42:19,870
Minister, after you.

1201
01:42:21,103 --> 01:42:23,110
There you are. Your hat.

1202
01:42:23,195 --> 01:42:26,754
Oh, Harry, imagine having fun with
some Licorice Snap when I’m not around.

1203
01:42:26,839 --> 01:42:29,841
But I must warn you,
they are a bit of a mystery.

1204
01:44:01,743 --> 01:44:02,795
Teacher?

1205
01:44:03,543 --> 01:44:05,201
- Teacher.
- Whether.

1206
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:20,792
Igor Karkaroff, your husband
of Azkaban to your taste...

1207
01:44:20,877 --> 01:44:22,804
…to present evidence at this event.

1208
01:44:22,947 --> 01:44:25,466
Do you need your testimonial
show your importance...

1209
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:29,280
…maybe the council decides
to order your immediate release.

1210
01:44:30,153 --> 01:44:33,207
Until then, you’ll stay
in the eyes of the Ministry

1211
01:44:33,292 --> 01:44:34,702
a sinner of death.

1212
01:44:34,787 --> 01:44:36,392
Do you agree with this message?

1213
01:44:37,153 --> 01:44:39,125
- I do, sir.
- And what do you want to prove?

1214
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,037
I have my name, sir.

1215
01:44:43,054 --> 01:44:46,470
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1216
01:44:49,392 --> 01:44:50,628
Rosier is dead.

1217
01:44:50,713 --> 01:44:53,068
He carried a piece of me
however, isn’t it?

1218
01:44:53,234 --> 01:44:54,377
I didn’t know.

1219
01:44:54,462 --> 01:44:55,954
If that’s all
witness has something to offer...

1220
01:44:56,039 --> 01:44:57,138
No, no, no.

1221
01:44:57,303 --> 01:44:59,912
There was Rookwood! He was a fighter.

1222
01:45:00,763 --> 01:45:03,218
Augustus Rookwood?
What about the Department of Mysteries?

1223
01:45:03,303 --> 01:45:04,471
Yes, yes the same.

1224
01:45:04,556 --> 01:45:07,713
He shared information with You-Know-Who
from within the Ministry itself.

1225
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,428
Very good.

1226
01:45:10,983 --> 01:45:12,250
Council will decide.

1227
01:45:13,015 --> 01:45:15,022
At that time,
they will send you back to Azkaban.

1228
01:45:15,107 --> 01:45:19,849
No! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1229
01:45:19,934 --> 01:45:22,983
As the organization is well aware,
I have given evidence in this regard.

1230
01:45:23,068 --> 01:45:25,157
Severus Snape was definitely a Death Eater

1231
01:45:25,242 --> 01:45:27,180
and, before the Lord
Voldemort's downfall...

1232
01:45:27,265 --> 01:45:29,479
...became a security guard in
high personal risk.

1233
01:45:29,564 --> 01:45:30,418
What a lie!

1234
01:45:30,503 --> 01:45:32,001
Now he’s not as much of a death eater as I am.

1235
01:45:32,086 --> 01:45:33,926
Severus Snape remains steadfast
by the Dark Lord!

1236
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:36,039
Silence!

1237
01:45:37,003 --> 01:45:40,352
Unless the witness has
his real name is special...

1238
01:45:40,437 --> 01:45:42,387
...this meeting is now over.

1239
01:45:42,883 --> 01:45:44,532
No, no, no.

1240
01:45:46,018 --> 01:45:47,478
I've heard of one more.

1241
01:45:47,563 --> 01:45:49,388
- What's that?
- The name.

1242
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:51,808
- Whether?
- I know the truth...

1243
01:45:51,893 --> 01:45:53,624
…this person contributed
in the dungeon...

1244
01:45:54,012 --> 01:45:56,358
...and, with
of the Cruciatus Curse…

1245
01:45:56,443 --> 01:46:00,116
...tragedy of Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1246
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,475
The name.
Give me that bad name!

1247
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,743
Barty Crouch...

1248
01:46:07,873 --> 01:46:08,951
...Junior.

1249
01:46:18,383 --> 01:46:19,648
Stop it!

1250
01:46:23,723 --> 01:46:26,832
Get your dirty hands off me.
you poor little people!

1251
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:30,161
Hello, Dad.

1252
01:46:31,987 --> 01:46:33,504
You are not my son.

1253
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:49,260
Desire is not a crime, Harry.
But you have to be careful.

1254
01:46:51,283 --> 01:46:52,611
It's a Pensieve.

1255
01:46:52,696 --> 01:46:56,982
Especially if, like me,
you find your mind a little distant.

1256
01:46:57,673 --> 01:47:00,732
It allows me to see again
things I've seen.

1257
01:47:01,673 --> 01:47:04,403
You see, Harry, I’ve been lookin
and found something...

1258
01:47:04,803 --> 01:47:06,576
...a few things...

1259
01:47:07,803 --> 01:47:09,428
…something I might have missed…

1260
01:47:10,103 --> 01:47:13,620
…something to explain why
this terrible thing has happened.

1261
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:18,789
Every time I approach a sentence,
plays.

1262
01:47:19,938 --> 01:47:21,249
It’s sad.

1263
01:47:23,138 --> 01:47:25,464
Lord? Mr. Crouch icon.

1264
01:47:26,493 --> 01:47:28,189
What exactly happened to him?

1265
01:47:28,664 --> 01:47:30,467
He was sent to Azkaban.

1266
01:47:31,366 --> 01:47:32,992
He destroyed Barty to do it.

1267
01:47:34,203 --> 01:47:37,386
But there was nothing he could do.
The symptoms were overwhelming.

1268
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:41,532
- Why do you ask?
- Just because I...

1269
01:47:43,003 --> 01:47:44,782
I had a dream about him.

1270
01:47:47,383 --> 01:47:49,616
It was in the summer, before school.

1271
01:47:52,353 --> 01:47:54,667
In the dream I was in a house.

1272
01:47:55,523 --> 01:47:59,778
And Voldemort was there,
only he was not a man.

1273
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:03,292
And Wormtail was there too.
And the son of Mr. Crouch.

1274
01:48:04,483 --> 01:48:06,985
- Are there other dreams like this?
- Whether.

1275
01:48:08,153 --> 01:48:09,359
Always the same.

1276
01:48:12,703 --> 01:48:14,836
Sir, this dream...

1277
01:48:15,207 --> 01:48:19,550
…from what I see, you don’t think
it really does happen, doesn’t it?

1278
01:48:22,123 --> 01:48:24,772
I think it’s not smart for you
to stay in this dream, Harry.

1279
01:48:25,553 --> 01:48:27,206
I think it's best to just...

1280
01:48:33,223 --> 01:48:34,480
...throw them away.

1281
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:47,531
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I do.

1282
01:48:56,929 --> 01:48:57,866
Potter!

1283
01:48:58,333 --> 01:49:00,554
What are you doing?

1284
01:49:06,018 --> 01:49:09,280
Thank you, what you did
on the Black Lake was inspiring.

1285
01:49:09,923 --> 01:49:11,564
Gillyweed, am I right?

1286
01:49:12,885 --> 01:49:13,753
Yes, sir.

1287
01:49:15,433 --> 01:49:16,375
Smart.

1288
01:49:18,643 --> 01:49:21,786
A perennial herb, gillyweed.

1289
01:49:23,443 --> 01:49:26,464
Nothing found
in your everyday garden.

1290
01:49:28,613 --> 01:49:30,246
Neither is this.

1291
01:49:34,783 --> 01:49:35,793
Do you know what it is?

1292
01:49:37,743 --> 01:49:39,151
Bubble juice, my lord?

1293
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,303
Veritaserum.

1294
01:49:42,373 --> 01:49:46,137
Three episodes of this and You-Know-Who
he would explain the darkest things himself.

1295
01:49:46,222 --> 01:49:49,806
Sometimes with a student
is, unfortunately, inadequate.

1296
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:50,743
Though...

1297
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:55,149
…you have to steal
from my store again...

1298
01:49:55,234 --> 01:50:00,281
…my hand might just slip
your morning pumpkin juice.

1299
01:50:00,366 --> 01:50:04,746
- I didn't steal anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1300
01:50:05,853 --> 01:50:11,869
Gillyweed may be harmless,
But boomslang leather, lacewing fly?

1301
01:50:12,283 --> 01:50:15,613
You and your kids are set
Polyjuice Potion, and ​trust me...

1302
01:50:15,698 --> 01:50:17,056
...I'll find out why!

1303
01:50:44,813 --> 01:50:46,502
- Whether!
- Whether!

1304
01:51:05,416 --> 01:51:07,015
Sonorous!

1305
01:51:11,256 --> 01:51:16,636
Recently, Professor Moody added
the Triwizard Cup located deep in the maze.

1306
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,896
Only he knows where it is.

1307
01:51:19,385 --> 01:51:21,086
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1308
01:51:23,933 --> 01:51:25,013
...and Mr. Potter…

1309
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:29,211
…are lined up with the first place…

1310
01:51:29,296 --> 01:51:31,355
… they will be the first
to enter the maze,

1311
01:51:31,646 --> 01:51:32,905
then Mr. Krum...

1312
01:51:34,617 --> 01:51:37,874
- ...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1313
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:42,436
The first person to touch the cup
will be the victory!

1314
01:51:46,663 --> 01:51:49,347
I have trained the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1315
01:51:49,533 --> 01:51:52,374
If, at any point, an enemy wants to
to get away from that work...

1316
01:51:52,459 --> 01:51:56,666
…he just has to send
black sparks with their rods.

1317
01:51:57,375 --> 01:52:00,423
Warriors! Gather somewhere. Prompt!

1318
01:52:04,465 --> 01:52:08,367
In the maze, you won’t find dragons
or animals that live far away.

1319
01:52:09,063 --> 01:52:12,047
Only, you’ll find something
it’s still hard.

1320
01:52:12,412 --> 01:52:15,559
You see, people change in the maze.

1321
01:52:15,644 --> 01:52:17,497
Oh, get the bowl if you can.

1322
01:52:17,745 --> 01:52:21,732
But be very careful, you might just
get lost along the way.

1323
01:52:23,913 --> 01:52:26,374
Champions, get ready!

1324
01:52:34,703 --> 01:52:36,462
Goodbye Cedric.

1325
01:52:37,555 --> 01:52:38,842
- My son.
- See you later, Dad.

1326
01:52:42,327 --> 01:52:44,683
In the story of three. An...

1327
01:56:12,219 --> 01:56:13,215
Fleur?

1328
01:56:15,383 --> 01:56:16,280
Fleur.

1329
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:21,542
Periculum!

1330
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:01,850
Get down!

1331
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:04,045
Get down!

1332
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:06,375
Expelliarmus!

1333
01:57:16,042 --> 01:57:19,282
No, no! Stop!
He's magic, Cedric!

1334
01:57:19,367 --> 01:57:20,899
- Get down!
- He's bewitching!

1335
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:34,136
Whether.

1336
01:57:55,592 --> 01:57:56,735
Harry!

1337
01:57:59,736 --> 01:58:00,757
Harry!

1338
01:58:03,548 --> 01:58:04,518
Harry!

1339
01:58:07,698 --> 01:58:08,713
Harry!

1340
01:58:11,007 --> 01:58:12,181
Reduct!

1341
01:58:29,933 --> 01:58:31,698
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1342
01:58:32,813 --> 01:58:36,990
You know, somewhere in there,
I thought you were going to let it get to me.

1343
01:58:37,693 --> 01:58:38,846
To some extent, I did too.

1344
01:58:41,323 --> 01:58:42,493
Some game, eh?

1345
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:44,368
Some games.

1346
01:58:50,484 --> 01:58:51,446
Go!

1347
01:59:02,133 --> 01:59:04,777
Go ahead, take it.
You saved me, accept it!

1348
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,293
- Together. One, two…
- Two...

1349
01:59:07,378 --> 01:59:08,355
...three!
...three!

1350
01:59:20,852 --> 01:59:23,508
- Are you okay?
- Whether. You?

1351
01:59:31,076 --> 01:59:32,257
Where are we?

1352
01:59:38,086 --> 01:59:39,319
I've been here before.

1353
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:44,622
It is a Portkey.

1354
01:59:46,917 --> 01:59:50,398
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1355
01:59:52,963 --> 01:59:55,484
Cedric! We need to get back to the bowl.

1356
01:59:55,922 --> 01:59:56,783
Now!

1357
01:59:56,868 --> 01:59:57,952
What are you saying?

1358
02:00:03,993 --> 02:00:06,273
- Harry! What is that?
- Go back to the bowl!

1359
02:00:14,265 --> 02:00:16,958
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spares.

1360
02 :00:17,043 --> 02:00:19,954
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1361
02:00:30,968 --> 02:00:32,779
Do it! Now!

1362
02:00:44,792 --> 02:00:47,121
That's why my father...

1363
02:00:47,366 --> 02:00:49,924
…they don’t want to give.

1364
02:00:57,294 --> 02:01:00,294
The body of the slave...

1365
02:01:02,415 --> 02:01:05,082
... wholeheartedly surrendered.

1366
02:01:09,779 --> 02:01:12,479
And the blood of the warrior...

1367
02:01:19,107 --> 02:01:21,453
... forcefully taken.

1368
02:01:27,823 --> 02:01:30,820
The Dark Lord will rise...

1369
02:01:31,533 --> 02:01:32,451
...again.

1370
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:39,424
The tree, Wormtail.

1371
02:02:49,823 --> 02:02:51,417
Put your hand down.

1372
02:02:52,037 --> 02:02:53,122
Master.

1373
02:02:53,697 --> 02:02:55,784
Thank you, Master.

1374
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:58,014
The other hand, Wormtail.

1375
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,039
Welcome, friends.

1376
02:03:41,867 --> 02:03:44,798
Thirteen years later, and still...

1377
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:49,955
...here you stand before me
as if it were only yesterday.

1378
02:03:51,819 --> 02:03:53,814
I’m talking to myself…

1379
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:56,279
...disappointed.

1380
02:03:57,423 --> 02:03:59,395
And none of you dared to look for me.

1381
02:03:59,683 --> 02:04:03,054
Crabbe! Macnair!

1382
02:04:03,863 --> 02:04:05,025
Goyle!

1383
02:04:07,646 --> 02:04:08,835
Nor do we...

1384
02:04:13,266 --> 02:04:14,354
...Lucius.

1385
02:04:17,073 --> 02:04:21,742
Lord, if I had seen a vision?
a word about where you live...

1386
02:04:21,827 --> 02:04:25,105
There were signs, my running friend.
And especially about language.

1387
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:30,359
I assure you, Lord.
I have never left the old ways.

1388
02:04:32,164 --> 02:04:37,613
The face I need to show
every day since you’ve been gone…

1389
02:04:39,763 --> 02:04:41,673
...that's my true friend.

1390
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:43,814
I came back.

1391
02:04:46,678 --> 02:04:49,792
Out of fear, not faith.

1392
02:04:51,749 --> 02:04:56,818
Nevertheless, you have proven to be very helpful
this was a few months ago, Wormtail.

1393
02:05:02,624 --> 02:05:05,043
Thank you, Master.

1394
02:05:05,646 --> 02:05:06,732
Thank you.

1395
02:05:10,583 --> 02:05:12,885
- A very attractive young man.
- Don't touch it!

1396
02:05:14,423 --> 02:05:15,451
Harry.

1397
02:05:16,025 --> 02:05:18,585
I almost forgot you were here.

1398
02:05:19,045 --> 02:05:21,663
It stands on my father's bones.

1399
02:05:22,452 --> 02:05:23,387
Whether.

1400
02:05:23,612 --> 02:05:24,631
I would have met you...

1401
02:05:24,716 --> 02:05:28,800
…but rumor has it we’re close
like me are popular these days.

1402
02:05:32,056 --> 02:05:34,318
The boy who lived.

1403
02:05:34,904 --> 02:05:37,736
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1404
02:05:38,042 --> 02:05:41,617
Shall I prove what really happened?
that night 13 years ago?

1405
02:05:41,913 --> 02:05:46,481
Shall I explain how
Did I really lose my strength?

1406
02:05:46,993 --> 02:05:48,167
Yes, can you?

1407
02:05:49,115 --> 02:05:50,112
It was love.

1408
02:05:50,644 --> 02:05:54,952
You see, when dear, dear Lily Potter
he gave his life for his only son...

1409
02:05:55,037 --> 02:05:57,633
…he provided the ultimate security.

1410
02:05:58,143 --> 02:05:59,384
I couldn’t touch it.

1411
02:06:01,167 --> 02:06:03,071
It was ancient magic.

1412
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:05,265
Something I should have seen earlier.

1413
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:07,532
But it's okay, it's okay.

1414
02:06:07,929 --> 02:06:09,773
Things have changed.

1415
02:06:10,869 --> 02:06:13,462
I can punish you...

1416
02:06:14,976 --> 02:06:15,868
...now.

1417
02:06:24,913 --> 02:06:25,783
Whether.

1418
02:06:32,504 --> 02:06:35,590
It’s amazing what a few drops
what your blood will do, won't it, Harry?

1419
02:06:36,963 --> 02:06:38,445
Take your wand, Potter.

1420
02:06:40,702 --> 02:06:43,075
I said, take it! Get up! Get up!

1421
02:06:44,688 --> 02:06:46,827
You are taught how to fight,
I think, yeah?

1422
02:06:46,912 --> 02:06:49,249
First, we bow to each other.

1423
02:06:49,683 --> 02:06:52,093
Come on, now, Harry.
The quality must be achieved.

1424
02:06:52,178 --> 02:06:54,846
Dumbledore wouldn’t want you
to forget your existence, right?

1425
02:06:55,190 --> 02:06:57,024
I said, kneel down.

1426
02:06:58,813 --> 02:07:02,444
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1427
02:07:03,406 --> 02:07:04,563
Crucious!

1428
02:07:07,792 --> 02:07:09,081
Crucious!

1429
02:07:10,703 --> 02:07:12,143
Attaboy, Harry.

1430
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:14,507
Your parents would be proud.

1431
02:07:15,122 --> 02:07:18,261
Especially your dirty Muggle mother.

1432
02:07:18,346 --> 02:07:19,353
Expelliar...

1433
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,547
I will kill you, Harry Potter.

1434
02:07:26,013 --> 02:07:27,480
I will destroy you.

1435
02:07:30,183 --> 02:07:35,661
After tonight, no one again
ask for my strength.

1436
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:39,004
After tonight, if they call you...

1437
02:07:39,089 --> 02:07:40,922
… they’ll just talk about how you…

1438
02:07:42,052 --> 02:07:43,299
...asked to die.

1439
02:07:44,113 --> 02:07:46,689
And I, being a loving God…

1440
02:07:48,403 --> 02:07:49,429
...rules.

1441
02:07:50,363 --> 02:07:51,258
Get up!

1442
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:58,668
Don't turn to me,
Harry Potter!

1443
02:07:58,753 --> 02:08:01,079
I want you to look at me when I kill you!

1444
02:08:01,309 --> 02:08:04,046
I want to see the light come out of your eyes!

1445
02:08:18,443 --> 02:08:19,443
Make it your way.

1446
02:08:21,353 --> 02:08:23,084
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1447
02:08:41,253 --> 02:08:43,760
Don't do anything! He’s mine to finish!

1448
02:08:48,503 --> 02:08:49,858
He's mine!

1449
02:09:23,269 --> 02:09:26,982
Harry, when the connection is broken,
You need to go to Portkey.

1450
02:09:27,415 --> 02:09:29,336
We can stay awhile
to give you some time...

1451
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:31,211
…just a little bit.
Do you understand?

1452
02:09:32,633 --> 02:09:35,246
Harry, give me back my body, will you?

1453
02:09:36,048 --> 02:09:37,766
Take my body back to my father.

1454
02:09:39,433 --> 02:09:40,546
Let.

1455
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:42,682
Brother, you are gone.

1456
02:09:44,023 --> 02:09:46,577
Let! Let!

1457
02:09:52,403 --> 02:09:53,846
Good!

1458
02:09:59,325 --> 02:10:01,334
No!

1459
02:10:14,213 --> 02:10:15,474
He did it!

1460
02:10:17,173 --> 02:10:18,149
Harry!

1461
02:10:21,069 --> 02:10:22,127
Harry!

1462
02:10:24,032 --> 02:10:26,657
No! No! No, no!

1463
02:10:27,948 --> 02:10:29,818
By God, Dumbledore,
what happened?

1464
02:10:29,903 --> 02:10:32,033
He turned away. He turned away.

1465
02:10:32,714 --> 02:10:34,030
Voldemort turned.

1466
02:10:34,405 --> 02:10:36,811
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1467
02:10:37,024 --> 02:10:39,570
I couldn’t leave it, not there.

1468
02:10:39,655 --> 02:10:42,296
All right, Harry. It's all good.

1469
02:10:42,990 --> 02:10:45,233
He’s home. You are you.

1470
02:10:45,318 --> 02:10:48,595
Get everyone in their seats.
A young man has just been killed.

1471
02:10:52,043 --> 02:10:55,441
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are so many people.

1472
02:10:55,887 --> 02:10:56,832
Let me pass.

1473
02:10:57,813 --> 02:10:58,856
Let me through!

1474
02:11:01,239 --> 02:11:02,409
Let me through!

1475
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:04,153
That's my son!

1476
02:11:05,349 --> 02:11:06,925
That's my son!

1477
02:11:09,733 --> 02:11:11,611
It’s my son!”

1478
02:11:15,233 --> 02:11:18,049
- Come on. Get up. It’s easy, it’s easy!
- No.

1479
02:11:19,102 --> 02:11:21,332
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1480
02:11:22,377 --> 02:11:24,728
No!

1481
02:11:27,913 --> 02:11:29,679
All right, I got you.

1482
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:33,129
I've got you. Come on. It’s easy, for now.

1483
02:11:37,803 --> 02:11:39,074
No!

1484
02:11:40,624 --> 02:11:42,372
No!

1485
02:12:24,973 --> 02:12:26,057
"Are you alright, Potter?"

1486
02:12:27,344 --> 02:12:28,841
Does it hurt too much? What is?

1487
02:12:29,353 --> 02:12:30,592
Not so much right now.

1488
02:12:32,103 --> 02:12:33,532
Maybe I’ll pay better attention.

1489
02:12:37,313 --> 02:12:38,658
The cup was a Portkey.

1490
02:12:42,033 --> 02:12:43,198
Someone was whispering.

1491
02:12:44,153 --> 02:12:45,248
What was it like?

1492
02:12:46,573 --> 02:12:48,279
- How was it?
- Subject?

1493
02:12:48,364 --> 02:12:49,616
The Dark Lord.

1494
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:55,020
How was it
to stand up to him?

1495
02:12:56,833 --> 02:12:57,738
I do not know.

1496
02:13:01,503 --> 02:13:03,947
It was like I was falling
in one of my dreams...

1497
02:13:07,393 --> 02:13:08,741
…in one of my nightmares.

1498
02:13:28,018 --> 02:13:29,029
Were there others?

1499
02:13:29,825 --> 02:13:31,299
In the cemetery, were there others?

1500
02:13:36,043 --> 02:13:36,948
I...

1501
02:13:37,964 --> 02:13:41,581
I don’t think I said anything
of a cave, master.

1502
02:13:49,497 --> 02:13:52,246
“Fantastic animals, dragons.
isn’t it?”

1503
02:13:57,325 --> 02:13:59,737
Did you think the pain was bad?
it would take you to the mountain...

1504
02:13:59,822 --> 02:14:01,281
...if I hadn't told you?

1505
02:14:05,854 --> 02:14:09,681
Do you think Cedric Diggory would
told you to open the blood vessel underwater...

1506
02:14:09,766 --> 02:14:11,456
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1507
02:14:13,737 --> 02:14:15,819
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the stupid shooter...

1508
02:14:16,813 --> 02:14:19,238
…could give you gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1509
02:14:19,323 --> 02:14:20,736
…which led him straight to her?

1510
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:31,289
It was you from the beginning.

1511
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:34,037
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1512
02:14:34,603 --> 02:14:37,564
- You were attracted to Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1513
02:14:38,433 --> 02:14:40,563
You won because of me, Potter.

1514
02:14:41,233 --> 02:14:44,613
We ended up in the cave tonight
because it was like that.

1515
02:14:44,903 --> 02:14:46,205
And now the work is done.

1516
02:14:47,748 --> 02:14:51,263
The blood flow through these veins
runs inside the Dark Lord.

1517
02:15:00,523 --> 02:15:04,391
Guess how much it costs me
while learning...

1518
02:15:05,046 --> 02:15:06,899
…which I have once and for all…

1519
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:12,390
...interrupted by the great Harry Potter.

1520
02:15:12,475 --> 02:15:13,685
Expelliarmus!

1521
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:19,655
Severus.

1522
02:15:22,314 --> 02:15:23,749
That's right, take it.

1523
02:15:25,935 --> 02:15:27,037
Do you know who I am?

1524
02:15:27,857 --> 02:15:29,352
Albus Dumbledore.

1525
02:15:29,437 --> 02:15:32,143
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1526
02:15:32,453 --> 02:15:35,374
Does he live in this house? Does he live in this house?

1527
02:15:38,402 --> 02:15:39,546
"Harry, get away from there!"

1528
02:16:01,103 --> 02:16:02,415
Are you okay, Alastor?

1529
02:16:02,998 --> 02:16:04,467
Sorry, Albus.

1530
02:16:05,319 --> 02:16:06,688
That’s Moody. But then who…?

1531
02:16:09,273 --> 02:16:10,440
Polyjuice Potion.

1532
02:16:10,525 --> 02:16:13,019
Now we know who was stealing
of your shop, Severus.

1533
02:16:13,957 --> 02:16:15,306
We’ll stop you in a minute.

1534
02:16:50,268 --> 02:16:51,190
Harry!

1535
02:16:55,308 --> 02:16:57,169
Barty Crouch Junior.

1536
02:16:57,786 --> 02:17:00,231
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

1537
02:17:03,203 --> 02:17:04,436
Momax, Harry.

1538
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:10,467
You know what this means, right?

1539
02:17:11,796 --> 02:17:12,846
He turned away.

1540
02:17:14,423 --> 02:17:16,411
Lord Voldemort turned.

1541
02:17:17,513 --> 02:17:19,195
Excuse me, sir. I couldn’t stop.

1542
02:17:20,053 --> 02:17:21,487
Send a dog to Azkaban.

1543
02:17:22,174 --> 02:17:23,791
I think they will find
one punishment is missing.

1544
02:17:24,913 --> 02:17:27,733
- I'll be accepted as an important person again.
- Maybe.

1545
02:17:28,103 --> 02:17:30,366
Personally, I’ve never had much time
for heroes.

1546
02:17:50,730 --> 02:17:53,104
Now, we know…

1547
02:17:54,167 --> 02:17:56,113
…a terrible loss.

1548
02:17:59,133 --> 02:18:01,407
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know…

1549
02:18:01,986 --> 02:18:03,804
...he works so hard...

1550
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:07,190
...so right...

1551
02:18:08,130 --> 02:18:09,871
…and, most importantly…

1552
02:18:10,813 --> 02:18:14,723
...a strong, strong friend.

1553
02:18:16,523 --> 02:18:20,264
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know how he died.

1554
02:18:23,953 --> 02:18:24,909
See...

1555
02:18:26,333 --> 02:18:28,203
…Cedric Diggory was killed…

1556
02:18:29,224 --> 02:18:30,713
…with Lord Voldemort!

1557
02:18:33,213 --> 02:18:36,079
The Ministry of Magic
he doesn’t want me to tell you this.

1558
02:18:37,423 --> 02:18:40,355
But I won’t do anything, I think,
it would be a mental challenge.

1559
02:18:43,223 --> 02:18:44,295
Now, the pressure…

1560
02:18:45,110 --> 02:18:48,534
…we all feel this great pain
Reminds me...

1561
02:18:48,763 --> 02:18:49,929
…and it reminds us…

1562
02:18:50,483 --> 02:18:54,129
…that even though we may come from different
cities and speak different languages...

1563
02:18:54,353 --> 02:18:57,162
…our hearts beat as one.

1564
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,621
With recent events...

1565
02:19:00,653 --> 02:19:02,715
…the love of love
we’re doing it this year

1566
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:05,345
will be more important than ever.

1567
02:19:06,453 --> 02:19:10,842
Imagine that, and ​Cedric Diggory
he would not die in vain.

1568
02:19:12,203 --> 02:19:13,818
You remember the...

1569
02:19:14,963 --> 02:19:17,399
…and celebrating a young man who was…

1570
02:19:18,474 --> 02:19:20,425
...good and fair and...

1571
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:25,259
…brave and true, right to the end.

1572
02:19:51,158 --> 02:19:52,758
I never liked these curtains.

1573
02:19:53,914 --> 02:19:55,937
Burn them in my office four years.

1574
02:19:56,892 --> 02:19:58,115
With one exception, of course.

1575
02:20:04,473 --> 02:20:07,027
I’m putting you in a bind
danger this year, Harry.

1576
02:20:07,473 --> 02:20:08,340
I'm sorry.

1577
02:20:12,157 --> 02:20:13,053
Teacher...

1578
02:20:14,143 --> 02:20:16,578
...when I was in the grave,
there was a moment...

1579
02:20:17,882 --> 02:20:22,159
…when Voldemort’s wand and mine
as it is connected.

1580
02:20:23,797 --> 02:20:25,621
Priori Incantatem.

1581
02:20:30,413 --> 02:20:32,374
You saw your parents last night.
No?

1582
02:20:33,703 --> 02:20:34,729
They appeared again.

1583
02:20:36,908 --> 02:20:40,022
There's no spell that can bring the dead back to life, Harry.
I’m sure you know that.

1584
02:20:43,343 --> 02:20:45,305
Darkness and difficult times are ahead.

1585
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:50,549
Soon we will all have to face the choice
between precision and simplicity.

1586
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,503
But remember this:

1587
02:20:56,473 --> 02:20:57,710
You have friends here.

1588
02:21:00,324 --> 02:21:01,296
You are not alone.

1589
02:21:22,745 --> 02:21:23,617
Hermione.

1590
02:21:24,955 --> 02:21:26,375
This is for you.

1591
02:21:27,542 --> 02:21:29,339
Write to me. Promise.

1592
02:21:30,772 --> 02:21:31,675
Bye.

1593
02:21:38,595 --> 02:21:39,673
Cheers , Ron.

1594
02:22:24,393 --> 02:22:27,004
Do you think one day we will just have
a year of peace at Hogwarts?

1595
02:22:27,089 --> 02:22:28,199
- No.
- No.

1596
02:22:28,403 --> 02:22:29,577
No, I didn’t think so.

1597
02:22:29,819 --> 02:22:32,146
Oh, okay.
What’s life without some dragons?

1598
02:22:37,203 --> 02:22:39,275
Everything will change now,
right?

1599
02:22:47,333 --> 02:22:48,227
Whether.

1600
02:22:53,553 --> 02:22:56,771
Decide what you’re going to write this summer.
Both.

1601
02:22:56,856 --> 02:22:58,962
I won’t do it. You know I won't.

1602
02:23:00,853 --> 02:23:03,697
- Harry will, won't he?
- Whether. Every week.


1
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,787
I don’t know about you,
it’s just hot these days, isn’t it?

2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,987
And it's going to get worse.
Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,788
…it’s the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow,
it can even reach 100.

4
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,587
So, please remember to cover up
and stay straight...

5
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,387
…with the hottest tune on your FM.

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,585
Come on guys, it's time to go home.

7
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,394
Come on, honey, come on out.

8
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,593
- Inevitable?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,990
I’ll make your favorite dish
to pay.

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,386
He was squealing like a pig, wasn’t he?

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,984
Yeah, great, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,389
Good luck, Big D.

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,386
Would you hit another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,187
- This one deserved it.
- Whether.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,591
- Five to one, very strong.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,186
Do you scream in your sleep every night?
At least I’m not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,785
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,984
“Who’s Cedric, your friend?”

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,787
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mom."

20
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,587
Where is it found?

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,792
Where is your mother, Potter?

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,984
Is he dead?

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,591
Is he dead?

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,591
Is he a dead Pott…?

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,989
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,986
- What happened?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,992
- I don't do anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,184
Come on, Dudley, get up.

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,189
Dudley, run.

30
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,791
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,189
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,589
Don't drop your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,387
They can come back.

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,992
Dementors in Little Whinging,
what happens next?

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,993
- The whole world is ending.
- I don't understand. How do you know…?

36
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,389
Dumbledore asked me
to protect you.

37
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,790
Dumbledore asked you?
Do you know Dumbledore?

38
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,588
Then You-Know-Who
killed baby Diggory last year...

39
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,194
…you hoped he’d let you
going for a walk alone?

40
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,987
Good Lord, young man.
I was told you were smart.

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,185
Now, go in and stay there.

42
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,183
Hopefully someone will call you soon.
No matter what happens, don't leave your house.

43
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,194
It’s too hot. As a result, it’s hot everywhere.

44
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,384
There is blood. There’s music.

45
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,391
Diddykins?

46
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,994
Is that you?

47
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,984
Duddy. Vernon, come quickly.

48
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,794
You will need
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,394
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,184
We’re happy, aren’t we, now?

51
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,594
Then you’re done.
Then we got it running.

52
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,592
Vernon, don’t say that.

53
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,991
Well, just watch, Petunia.
Our son is already so sweet.

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,184
I’ve reached the end, you hear?

55
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,387
This is the last one I’ll take
about you and what doesn’t matter.

56
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,384
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What is?

57
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,588
The Ministry has received feedback
which at 6:23 this morning...

58
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,185
… We made the Patronus Charm
in front of a Muggle.

59
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,384
As an obvious crime...

60
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,393
...from the Decree for the Reasonable
Punishment of underage witchcraft...

61
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,994
…with this you are removed…

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,788
...from Hogwarts School
of witchcraft and sorcery.

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,790
I hope you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,987
Justice.

65
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,794
He's not very well.

66
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,589
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,391
Very clearly, these are Muggles.

68
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,790
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Not really.

69
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,991
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,390
- What are you doing here?
- I'm saving you, of course.

71
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,387
But where are we going?
The letter said I was fired.

72
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,789
You’re not there. Not yet.
Kingsley, you get it.

73
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,983
But the letter said...

74
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,992
Dumbledore reassured the minister
to stop your download...

75
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,389
...are awaiting a legal decision.
- An ear?

76
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,790
Don't worry. We’ll say everything
when we get back to the main house.

77
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,984
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,391
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,385
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't destroy them if one of us kills us.

80
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,194
Come, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,591
Come on.

82
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,984
In you go, son.

83
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,592
There is no hope.

84
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,386
There is no death. There is no proof.

85
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,187
He almost killed Harry.
If that’s not proof enough…

86
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,591
Yes, but you are careful you know what
is the most important...

87
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,589
We have to trust Dumbledore in this matter.

88
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,991
Could he have protected Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it’s time to take action.

89
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,390
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a witch second.

90
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,585
- His instinct would be to ignore...
- Smile.

91
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,390
He’s getting bigger and bigger
by the minute. We need to do it now.

92
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,387
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,187
Heavens, you’re welcome.

94
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,788
A bit of a stretch, but I’m afraid the food will be waiting for me
until the end of the session.

95
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,988
No. There’s no time to explain.
Straight up, first door on the left.

96
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,991
Whether.

97
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,788
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,590
If my poor master
he knew the garbage was allowed into his house...

99
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,387
...what will he tell the old man Kreacher?

100
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,190
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,387
- Freaks.
- There, there, sir.

102
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,790
Soil debris.
It's not like it was in my parents' day.

103
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,985
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,191
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,193
Are you okay? We listened to them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,987
- You have to tell me everything.
- Leave the man alone, Hermione.

107
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,187
And this decision in the Ministry.
It’s just awful.

108
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,384
I’m looking at it.
They just can’t get rid of you.

109
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,585
- It's really not fair.
- Whether.

110
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,592
There are many of the
goes in the moment.

111
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,791
So, what is this area?

112
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,985
- It's the big house.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,792
It is a secret society.

114
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,394
Dumbledore created it when
they were fighting You-Know-Who.

115
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,585
I couldn’t put any of these
on a piece of paper, I think?

116
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,194
I went all day
no words.

117
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,988
We wanted to write, my friend.
In fact, we did.

118
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,989
- Only...
- Just what?

119
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,788
Only Dumbledore made us swear
I won't tell you anything.

120
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,984
Did Dumbledore say that?

121
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,987
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe this would help.

122
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,991
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,992
...who fought with him,
who saw Cedric Diggory murdered.

124
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,184
- Harry.
- I thought we heard your loud voice.

125
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,193
- Don't bottle it, though, buddy. Let it out.
- If you're done screaming...

126
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,192
Do you want to hear something
a little more serious?

127
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,185
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn’t for Harry…

128
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,384
…we wouldn’t know
Voldemort turned.

129
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,992
He’s not a child, Molly.

130
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,594
But he's not great either.

131
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,592
- It's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,989
He’s as good as.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,786
- Who else has it?
- Look, Ginny.

134
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,394
- He's got me.
- That's so paternal, Black.

135
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,392
Maybe Potter will grow up to be a criminal,
just like his father.

136
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,391
Now, stay away from this, Snivellus.

137
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,391
- Is Snape part of the Order?
- Go.

138
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,391
What is your proposed reform.

139
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,187
- I know better.
- Then why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,986
- Get out.
- Quick.

141
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,991
- Stop.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,184
- Stop.
- Get down, you asshole.

143
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,987
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Stop.

144
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,387
- Hermione, I hate your pussy.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,185
Well, we’ll eat in the kitchen.

146
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,789
Just because they allow you
to use magic now...

147
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,792
…doesn’t mean you have to
remove your box completely.

148
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,984
Good morning, Mom.

149
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,186
Are you hungry, Harry?

150
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,794
Are you alright, Harry?
He gave us a big hug.

151
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,587
Harry Potter.

152
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,389
Sirius.

153
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,589
This is very, very different.

154
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,184
You seem to hear it in the Ministry
it should be in front of the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,193
I don't understand. Contents
did the Ministry of Magic punish me?

156
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,393
Show him. He’ll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,190
He has also attacked Dumbledore.

158
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,383
Fudge uses all of his powers, including
his contribution to the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,585
…to punish someone who says
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,988
Why?

161
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,991
He thinks Dumbledore wants his job.

162
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,184
Nobody in their right
I could believe that...

163
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,987
It’s really the thing.
Fudge isn’t thinking clearly.

164
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,992
She sniffles and whimpers nervously.

165
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,589
Now, fear makes people
fuck off, Harry.

166
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,194
The last time Voldemort gained the upper hand...

167
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,385
...nearly destroyed
all of which we hold dear.

168
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,393
Now he's back, I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,790
…to avoid facing the horrible truth.

170
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,588
We think Voldemort
he wants to rebuild his army.

171
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,787
Fourteen years ago,
he had a lot of numbers in his command.

172
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,590
And not just witches and wizards,
but all things are darkness.

173
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,185
He has been looking for people,
and we are trying to do the same.

174
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,587
But they combine beliefs
that’s not all he wants.

175
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,189
We believe...

176
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,591
...Voldemort probably wants something.

177
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,192
Sirius.

178
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,590
Something he didn’t have last season.

179
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,391
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,393
No. That’s enough. Just a boy.

181
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,392
You say more and maybe even
add to the Order.

182
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,587
Good. I want to get involved. If Voldemort
I’ve gathered an army, so I want to fight.

183
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,991
Harry.

184
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,184
You are hereby excluded.

185
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,590
In front of the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,791
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,587
Remember, these are Muggles.

188
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,789
Here we are.

189
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,790
I’ve never used the passenger door
before. It should be fun.

190
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,590
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,392
Terrible. This lost many galleons
shop in the potions shop.

192
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,585
Everyday speaker, ladies and gentlemen.
Who for Daily Prophet?

193
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,184
Dumbledore: Is he a fool,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,990
- Goodnight, Arthur.
- Good afternoon, Bob.

195
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,586
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,787
We used to use mice.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,590
Merlin's head. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,388
- Changed the audio time.
- When is it?

199
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,584
In five minutes.

200
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,188
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,187
And I hope, Minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,794
Yes, but we have to be...

203
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,390
Remember, in the discussion,
speak only when he speaks to you.

204
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,188
Sit down. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,784
As the Muggles say, the truth will come out.

206
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,586
Whether?

207
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,987
They won't let me in, because I'm afraid.

208
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,184
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,994
Confined Listening
of August 12...

210
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,992
…in crimes committed
from Harry James Potter…

211
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,584
... living at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,785
Source: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...

213
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,586
Look at your safety.

214
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,990
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,584
...Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,990
You got our message
as to the date and place of the hearing...

217
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,594
...it's changed, hasn't it?
- I must have missed it.

218
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,991
But with a good mistake,
I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,383
The accusation?

220
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,994
The crime he is accused of
are as follows:

221
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,786
"He did that because he knew . . ."

222
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,384
…and in all seriousness
of illegal activities...

223
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,392
...creates a Patronus Charm...

224
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,585
…in front of a Muggle.”

225
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,990
- Do you want to do what Patronus said?
- No, but...

226
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,390
And you knew you
you're not allowed to use magic outside of school...

227
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,392
…when she’s under 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

228
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,790
Wizards and Wizards of the Wizengamot…

229
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,587
I was just doin
because of the Dementors.

230
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,784
Dementors?

231
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,392
In Little Whinging?

232
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,789
That’s very clever.

233
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,190
Muggles cannot see Dementors,
maybe, young man?

234
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,384
- Very good.
- I'm not lying.

235
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,994
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

236
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,187
I’m sorry for interrupting what I know I would
it's a very well put together story...

237
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,591
…but because you can
there are no witnesses to the incident...

238
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,583
Excuse me, minister,
but as it happens, it can.

239
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,784
Tell us about the struggle.

240
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,184
What did it look like?

241
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,991
Well, one of them was pretty big
and the other is much smaller.

242
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,392
Not the boys. In Dementors.

243
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,393
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,983
Hidden. Then everything cooled down…

245
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,390
…like all the fun
departed from the world.

246
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,383
Now, look here. Dementors aren’t just
walk around a Muggle town…

247
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,188
…and it happens to be a wizard.
The damages are astronomical.

248
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,986
I don't think anyone would believe it...

249
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,390
…the Dementors were there
by the way, minister.

250
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,192
I know I misunderstood you.
teacher.

251
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,593
Dementors are, after all,
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,787
And really stupid of me,
but it kinda sounds like...

253
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,793
…you wanted the Ministry
ordered the attack on this young man.

254
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,587
That would be very concerning,
Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,787
…so I know the Ministry
raising an interesting question...

256
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,190
…on why the two Dementors
they were a long way from Azkaban…

257
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,988
…and why they staged an attack
it has no control.

258
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,789
Yes, there is someone...

259
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,792
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,785
Cornelius, I beg you to understand the truth.

261
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,191
The revelation of the Dark Lord
he became irresistible.

262
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,590
He did not return.

263
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,194
In the case of Harry Potter…

264
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,794
…the law is clear…

265
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,191
…the magic can be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.

266
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,192
Rules can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

267
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,385
Certain. Has a study been conducted
to make a criminal judgment...

268
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,790
…to get organized in a simple way
what magic isn’t age?

269
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,193
Supporters of punishment?

270
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,393
Contributors
that will absolve the accused of all charges?

271
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,994
He was acquitted of all charges.

272
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,584
Teacher.

273
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,585
Padfoot. Are you playing?

274
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,387
You will complete the whole process.

275
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,594
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If someone sees you...

276
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,785
I had to visit you, didn’t I?”

277
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,394
What is life without a little risk?

278
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,789
I don’t want to see you
go back to Azkaban.

279
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,586
Don't worry about me.

280
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,993
However, I wanted you to keep this.

281
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,990
Original Rules of the Phoenix.

282
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,786
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,587
He was killed
two weeks after this was released.

284
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,184
Voldemort destroyed his entire family.

285
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,986
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,592
Neville’s parents.

287
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,787
They suffered something worse than death.
you ask me.

288
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,992
It’s been 14 years.

289
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,785
And still less than a day
I don’t remember your father.

290
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,785
Do you really think
will there be a fight, Sirius?

291
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,190
It feels like the first time.

292
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,984
You’ve got it.

293
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,790
However, I think
you guys are young now.

294
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,191
I’ll see you on the train.

295
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,794
Goodbye, my love.

296
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,991
I love you.

297
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,384
Look at my hands, darling.

298
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,584
There they are.
They are in the car from a distance.

299
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,591
Bye.

300
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,392
I am surprised by the Ministry
it also allows you to move freely.

301
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,992
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,788
I think there’s a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

303
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,991
- What did I tell you? It’s too bad.
- Just stay away from me!

304
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,989
Without Malfoy.

305
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,384
What did you expect?

306
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,388
All right, guys.

307
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,584
- Good luck, Neville.
- Good luck, Neville.

308
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,584
What is that?

309
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,788
- What the fuck?
- What is. He drove the car.

310
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,787
It's not driving the car, Harry.

311
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,394
He drives himself, as usual.

312
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,594
You won't go wrong.

313
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,194
I can see them too.

314
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,992
You're just like me.

315
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,594
Everyone, this Loony Love…

316
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,194
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,987
What a beautiful necklace.

318
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,787
It’s really a feeling.

319
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,584
It stops the Nargles.

320
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,591
Hungry.

321
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,194
I hope there will be pudding.

322
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,593
- What is a Nargle?
- I don't know.

323
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,191
Good evening, children.

324
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,787
Now, we have two variables
in the works this year.

325
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,792
We are happy to welcome you
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,394
...who will take
Protection from predators...

327
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,393
…while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,593
We’re also looking forward to welcoming our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,785
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,987
And I know you'll all join me
in wishing the student good luck.

331
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,593
Now, as always, our patron, Mr. Filch,
asked me to remind you...

332
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,387
He was in my ear.
She works at Fudge.

333
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,589
Thank you, Master,
for the good news that received us.

334
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,988
And it’s amazing to see all your lights…

335
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,992
…happy face that smiles at me.

336
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,188
I’m sure we’re all going
to be best friends.

337
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,794
- That's possible.
- That's possible.

338
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,992
The Ministry of Magic
always thinking...

339
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,791
...the training of young witches
and special witches.

340
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,984
Although each student...

341
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,393
…brought a whole new
in this old school...

342
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,594
…preparation for the future
We need to grieve.

343
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,588
Let’s protect
that we need to take care of...

344
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,184
...fixing what can be fixed...

345
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,992
…and design
that should have been prevented.

346
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,387
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That was really the most enlightening thing.

347
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,190
- Light? Which is a lot of waffle.
- What does it mean?

348
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,589
Magic is not allowed in the hallways...

349
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,593
It means that the Ministry
joining Hogwarts.

350
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,786
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,189
- Good day?
- All right.

352
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,987
Better than Seamus, though.

353
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,989
my mother didn’t want me
for me to return this year.

354
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,584
- Why not?
- Let's see. Because you are.

355
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,990
The Daily Prophet
a lot about you and Dumbledore.

356
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,388
What, your mother believes in them?

357
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,391
No one was there the night Cedric died.

358
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,585
I think you should read the prophet, then,
like your stupid mother.

359
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,184
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I will declare war on anyone who calls me a liar.

360
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,589
- What happened?
- He's furious, it's what's going on.

361
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,785
Do you believe the garbage that has taken
with You-Know-Who?

362
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,984
Whether. I do.

363
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,789
Who else
Do you have a problem with Harry?

364
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,794
- Are you okay?
- Good.

365
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,985
Seamus was in terrible shape, mate.

366
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,187
- But he'll pass, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

367
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,990
Right. I'll just leave you
to your point of view, then.

368
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,192
Harry.

369
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,994
Bring it here. Here.

370
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,790
Oh, come on, Seamus. Go ahead, get it.

371
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,986
Good morning, children.

372
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,588
Ordinary Wizard Level Exams.

373
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,194
O- W-Ls.

374
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,785
They are more commonly known as OWLs.

375
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,985
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

376
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,586
Don't do that,
and the pain can be devastating.

377
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,383
The previous lessons learned in this course
it’s very different.

378
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,584
But luckily you will know,
from today...

379
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,184
...to follow
a good solution, approved by the Ministry...

380
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,385
... safety training. Whether?

381
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,787
There’s nothing here
that you will use passwords?

382
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,392
Have you used spells?

383
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,188
Well, I can’t imagine why you would
I have to use spells in class.

384
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,992
Not using magic?

385
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,983
Learning about passwords
in a safe, risk-free way.

386
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,787
What does that matter?
If we are attacked, it will not be in vain.

387
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,190
Students raise their hands
when they talk in my class.

388
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,594
It depends on the Ministry...

389
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,387
…from a knowledge theory
will be enough...

390
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,391
...to help you with your exams...

391
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,994
...least,
it’s about school.

392
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,787
And how the theory should shape us
for what is there?

393
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,791
There’s nothing there, buddy.

394
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,985
Who do you think
He wants to target kids like you?

395
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,584
I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

396
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,190
Now, let me say this is pretty cool.

397
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,792
You’ve been told…

398
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,988
…as a dark wizard
is in remission again.

399
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,188
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw it. I fought with him.

400
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,792
Prisoner, Mr. Potter.

401
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,984
Cedric Diggory Dies
willingly?

402
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,594
Cedric Diggory imikilis
it was a terrible ordeal.

403
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,784
Elijah killed. Voldemort killed him.

404
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,791
Enough!

405
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,586
Enough.

406
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,390
See you later, Mr. Potter. No office.

407
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,192
Enter.

408
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,189
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

409
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,986
Sit.

410
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,588
You run a few lines
for now, Mr. Potter.

411
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,591
No, not with your pen.

412
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,388
I will use
one of the most important of mine.

413
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,591
Now...

414
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,189
...I want you to write,
"I don't have to lie."

415
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,784
How often?

416
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,783
Well, let’s say sometimes you need
for the message to sink into your heart.

417
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,986
You haven't given me any ink.

418
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,991
Oh, you won’t need any ink.

419
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,591
Whether?

420
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,788
- Nothing.
- That's right.

421
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,193
Because you know, in your mind…

422
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,589
...you should be punished.

423
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,794
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

424
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,391
Go away.

425
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,989
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweet stuff that makes you sick.

426
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,592
Get out of class whenever you want.

427
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,787
Find happy hours
which doesn’t matter.

428
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,588
Do you care about anyone else?

429
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,194
- I'm not asking you to write all that.
- Please.

430
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,590
I’ve been busy learning
for these stupid OWL exams.

431
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,386
I’ll make the introduction. That's all.

432
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,188
Hermione, you’re right
the most amazing person I’ve ever met.

433
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,785
- And if I ever punish you again...
- I'll know you're back to normal.

434
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,589
What's wrong with your hands?

435
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,591
Nothing.

436
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,589
The other hand.

437
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,391
"You should tell Dumbledore."
- No.

438
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,584
Dumbledore already has enough
in his mind right now.

439
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,784
I don't want to give
Learn that silence.

440
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,394
Too much blood, Harry.
That woman is hurting you.

441
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,791
- If the parents knew about this...
- I'm not having any of that, am I, Ron?

442
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,394
Harry, you need to report this.

443
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,984
- It's actually pretty easy. You are...
- No, no.

444
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,185
Hermione, none of this,
nothing.

445
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,194
You don't understand.

446
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,594
Then help us.

447
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,389
Brother Padfoot...

448
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,186
...I hope you're doing well.

449
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,183
It's getting cold here.
Summer is definitely coming.

450
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,183
Even though we are back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

451
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,188
I know you of all people.
will understand.

452
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,994
Good morning, Harry Potter.

453
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,983
- My mets. Isn’t it cold?
- Few.

454
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,791
After all, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

455
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,190
I think Nargles is behind it.

456
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,793
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

457
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,386
They’re very gentle, sure, but people
ignore them because they are a bit...

458
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,784
Different.

459
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,589
But why can't the others see them?

460
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,593
It can only be seen
of people who have seen death.

461
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,594
So you already know someone
who died, then?

462
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,784
His mother.

463
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,590
She was an amazing magician,
but he wanted to try...

464
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,990
…and one day,
one of his spells went terribly wrong.

465
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,787
- I was 9 years old.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,984
Yes, it was terrible.

467
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,791
Sometimes I get really upset about it,
but I have my father.

468
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,385
We both believe you, by the way.

469
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,792
The He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named returned,
and we fought with him...

470
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,985
…and The Ministry and The Prophet
they are determined to fight you.

471
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,187
Thank you. You seem to be
they are the only ones who do.

472
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,191
I don't think that's true.

473
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,985
But I think
that's how he wants you to feel.

474
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,389
What do you mean?

475
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,584
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

476
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,184
…I hope you feel ripped off
from everyone else...

477
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,385
…because if you’re alone…

478
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,387
…we’re not much of a threat.

479
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,783
- When do you stop eating?
- What is? I’m hungry.

480
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,192
Harry.

481
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,986
Can I join you?

482
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,392
Excuse me, Master,
but what exactly are you talking about?

483
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,187
I just ask
when it comes to my students...

484
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,591
…you do what you’re told
restrictions on behavior.

485
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,386
I'm so naive, but apparently...

486
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,393
… like asking for my permission
in my classroom...

487
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,788
...Minerva.

488
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,385
Axtleno, Dolores,
just with your old-fashioned attitude.

489
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,994
I’m sorry, my darling.

490
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,390
But to ask what I do
is to ask the Ministry...

491
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,392
…and by and large, the minister himself.

492
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,186
I’m a woman who loves…

493
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,593
…but that’s a thing
I’m not going to stop because it’s not true.

494
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,984
Not really.

495
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,993
Hogwarts Stuff
much worse than I feared.

496
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,993
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

497
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,391
What happened to Dumbledore?

498
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,994
You’ve already made a revolution…

499
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,992
…the education
of Defense Against the Dark Arts…

500
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,993
…Dolores Umbridge will,
as a great interviewer, he has the power...

501
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,385
…to fix the fallout
rules at Hogwarts School.

502
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,589
Just one question, my friend.

503
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,185
You are in this thread
How long, exactly?

504
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,188
You originally asked the Defense Against
the term Dark Arts, correct?

505
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,384
Whether.

506
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,585
But you didn’t win?

507
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,987
Obviously.

508
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,393
Can you tell me something
for what?

509
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,186
I'm sorry?

510
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,387
Click the words.

511
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,184
A young proverb?

512
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,191
Pity.

513
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,589
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I see something.

514
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,989
Yes, I do. Something is dark.

515
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,790
You are in grave danger.

516
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,984
Cute.

517
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,384
Cho. What has happened?

518
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,187
It’s Professor Trelawney.

519
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,784
I have lived and taught here for sixteen years.

520
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,190
Hogwarts is my home.

521
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,789
You can't do this.

522
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,387
Indeed, it can.

523
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,792
What do you mean?

524
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,792
Oh, there are so many
I would like to say.

525
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,984
There...

526
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,783
Professor McGonagall, may I ask
to bring Sybil back inside?

527
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,994
Sybil, my friend. This way.

528
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,991
Thank you.

529
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,593
Dumbledore, I can remind you
what with the word...

530
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,785
…of Educational Decree Number 23,
according to the minister...

531
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,985
You have the right
to fire my students.

532
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,584
You do not, however, have the authority
to get them out of the country.

533
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,184
The power rests with the leader.

534
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,186
Right now.

535
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,984
Don’t you all have classes to make?

536
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,592
Teacher.

537
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,392
Teacher?

538
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,187
Professor Dumbledore. Master!

539
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,794
Professor Dumbledore.

540
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,994
That bad, bad, big gargoyle.

541
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,188
We haven’t learned how to defend ourselves.
We haven’t learned how to pass our OWLs.

542
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,191
He’s got the whole school.

543
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,990
Protection is and will continue to be
the Ministry of Excellence.

544
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,787
Also,
we have reasons to believe...

545
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,792
... of this loss
is the work...

546
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,588
…the notorious
murderer Sirius Black.

547
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,386
Harry.

548
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,584
Sirius.

549
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,394
- What are you doing here?
- I'm answering your letter.

550
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,392
You said you were worried
from Umbridge. What is he doing?

551
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,391
Does it teach you to kill animals?

552
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,585
- Doesn't allow us to use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not afraid.

553
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,787
The new concept is Fudge
he doesn’t want you to be trained in combat.

554
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,188
War?

555
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,192
What does he think,
are we building some kind of wizard army?

556
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,588
That's exactly what he thinks.

557
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,787
The Dumbledore is determined
his army to take over the Ministry.

558
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,384
He’s becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

559
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,188
The others wouldn’t want me
I tell you this, Harry…

560
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,192
…but nothing goes well
by the Law.

561
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,794
Fudge Suppresses the Truth
at each stage...

562
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,191
…and this loss
it’s how it started before.

563
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,984
Voldemort is on his way.

564
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,991
Well, what can we do?

565
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,388
Someone is coming.

566
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,789
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

567
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,193
But for now, though,
It sounds like you are alone.

568
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,387
He’s definitely there, isn’t he?

569
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,785
We should be able to
to protect ourselves.

570
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,987
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
We need someone to do it.

571
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,387
Harry.

572
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,389
This is very bad.
Who would want him to teach me?

573
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,583
I’m a bad guy, remember?

574
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,185
Check out the pros:
You can’t be worse than the old bird.

575
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,988
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, buddy.

576
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,389
Who should meet me, then?

577
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,994
Just a couple of people.

578
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,191
Nice place.

579
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,384
I thought it would be great
about the wrong way.

580
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,187
Matey, come back here.

581
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,192
Hello.

582
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,987
So you all know why we're here.

583
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,786
We need a mentor.

584
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,189
A good teacher.

585
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,385
One that already has a lot of
protected against the Dark Arts.

586
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,186
- Why?
- Why?

587
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,384
Because You-Know-Who is back,
the tosspot.

588
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,186
- That's what it says.
- So says Dumbledore.

589
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,384
That’s what Dumbledore says because he says so.

590
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,187
The issue is, where is the proof?

591
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,390
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory was killed...

592
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,588
I’m not talking about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, get out now.

593
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,990
Come on, Hermione. They exist because
they think I'm kind of crazy.

594
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,185
Is it true that you can
a Patronus Charm?

595
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,791
Whether.

596
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,988
I've seen it.

597
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,594
Blimey, Harry.
I didn’t know you could do that.

598
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,793
He killed a basilisk, with sword
in Dumbledore's office.

599
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,188
It's true.

600
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,385
For three years, he competed
about a hundred Dementors at once.

601
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,987
Last year, he actually fought
You-Know-Who in person.

602
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,786
Wait.

603
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,385
Look, everything sounds good
when you say it like that...

604
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,984
…but the truth is,
a lot of it was pure luck.

605
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,788
I had no idea what I was doing
noon. I almost always had help.

606
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,793
- It just depends.
- No, Hermione, no.

607
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,788
These things in life
not like school.

608
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,590
In school, if you mess up,
you can just try it tomorrow.

609
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,591
But there...

610
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,990
…when you’re a second away
of murder...

611
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,993
…or watching a friend die
in your eyes...

612
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,384
You don't know what that's like.

613
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,589
You're right, Harry, we don't know.

614
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,984
That's why we need your help.

615
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,390
Because if we have
any chance of winning...

616
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,586
…Voldemort…

617
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,589
He's definitely back.

618
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,186
Right. First, we need to find
a place to learn...

619
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,588
...where Umbridge wouldn't know.

620
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,784
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

621
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,792
- Too bright?
- Not much blood.

622
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,984
Harry, what’s going to happen
what if Umbridge finds out?

623
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,786
Who cares?

624
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,590
I mean, it’s exciting, isn’t it?
does it break the law?

625
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,387
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

626
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,188
However, even if we know
something positive that comes from today.

627
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,986
What is it?

628
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,185
Cho couldn’t take his eyes off you,
would it be possible?

629
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,192
Right. In the future,
We must each come...

630
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,192
…with a couple of possibilities
from where we can learn.

631
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,988
We must, wherever possible,
there’s no way you can find us.

632
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,389
I will, Harry.

633
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,193
All student organizations
which are now separated.

634
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,988
Any student who disagrees
will be released.

635
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,992
Look where yas going, Longbottom.

636
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,787
You’ve done it, Neville.
We found the right place.

637
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,983
What?

638
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,594
Also known as
the Come and Come Room.

639
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,990
The required building is only visible
when a person really needs it.

640
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,594
And it’s always ready
for the needs of the seeker.

641
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,787
So say you really wanted the bathroom…

642
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,190
Well done, Ronald.
But, yeah, that’s what everyone thinks.

643
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:23,388
It’s really cool. Or like Hogwarts
he wants us to compete.

644
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,391
Expelliarmus.

645
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,392
I have no hope.

646
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,587
You’re just strengthening your tree too much.
Try it this way. Expelliarmus.

647
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,193
Would you please
the message received four times...

648
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,385
…to make it last longer.

649
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,188
- No comments needed.
- You don't have to think like him.

650
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,589
- Expelliarmus.
- Far away.

651
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,592
Stunning is one of the most important spells
in your arsenal.

652
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,989
It really is a wizard’s bread and butter.

653
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,993
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best.

654
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,591
Get lost!

655
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,390
Good. Nothing bad, Nigel. Well done.

656
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,389
Don't worry. I will go easy on you.

657
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,994
Thank you, Ronald.

658
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,189
"Come on, Ron."
"Come on, Ron."

659
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,385
- You can do it.
"Come on, Ron."

660
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,994
- It's Hoz.
- You're alive.

661
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,986
Be afraid.

662
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,189
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

663
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,183
I let him do that.
Good stuff, isn’t it?

664
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,792
It was completely intentional.

665
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,190
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

666
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,191
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

667
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,589
Expelliarmus.

668
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,585
Very good. Stay focused.

669
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,991
Great.

670
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,784
A little higher.

671
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,590
I'm fine. I'm fine.

672
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,392
- You're wrong.
- You're wrong.

673
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,790
Those interested in joining the Inquisitorial Squad
for more money...

674
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,587
…you can sign up
in the high court of the inquisitor.

675
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,784
Decreasing.

676
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,191
Hard work is important, but there is
something very interesting:

677
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,384
Believe in yourself.

678
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,584
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

679
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,192
Think of it this way.

680
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,387
Every great wizard in history
it's started...

681
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,393
…like nothing else
who we are now: students.

682
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,790
If they can do it, why can’t we?

683
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,184
- You're wrong.
- Expelliarmus.

684
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,586
Expelliarmus.

685
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,591
Expelliarmus.

686
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,186
Reduct.

687
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,592
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

688
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,387
Expelliarmus.

689
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,194
Expelliarmus.

690
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,188
All right, Neville. Well done, man.

691
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,384
So that’s it for this tutorial.

692
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,984
Now, we will no longer meet
until the end of the event.

693
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,992
So just keep educating yourself
as much as you can.

694
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,788
And well done, everyone.
Well, good job.

695
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,392
Well done, my friend.

696
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,391
Thank you.

697
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,192
See you after Christmas.

698
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,194
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

699
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,992
- Thank you very much, Harry.
- Don't worry.

700
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,987
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry christmas.

701
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,389
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry christmas.

702
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,186
- Merry christmas.
- Have a Merry Christmas.

703
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,987
- Merry Christmas, Luna.
- We've thought about it.

704
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,389
We could always ignore Umbridge
some Puking Pills.

705
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,187
The Fever Fudge. they give you
large, pus-filled...

706
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,192
Sounds good, guys.
Can you forgive me?

707
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,790
Are you okay? I heard Umbridge
It gave you a hard time at the time.

708
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,587
Whether. I'm fine.

709
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,985
However, it is worth it.

710
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,184
Except, I’m learning all this…

711
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,790
...makes me wonder if,
if only she knew...

712
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,985
Cedric certainly knew this.

713
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,787
It was really good.

714
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,185
Except, Voldemort was better.

715
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,189
You’re a great teacher, Harry.

716
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,190
I can never
to play anything beforehand.

717
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,584
Muérdago.

718
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,789
It can be full of Nargles, though.

719
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,384
What are Nargles?

720
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,784
I don’t know.

721
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,994
Well, how was it?

722
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,191
Wet.

723
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,191
I mean, he kind of cried.

724
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,384
Bad, isn’t it?

725
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,585
I know Harry smiles
it was so good.

726
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,989
Cho uses half-time
crying at this point.

727
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,594
You’d think a bit of music
would encourage him.

728
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,790
Don’t you understand
how should it feel?

729
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,984
Well, of course
she’s upset with Cedric…

730
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,992
…and is confused about wanting Harry
and guilty of ruining it...

731
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,390
…annoyed that Umbridge could
get her mother out of the Ministry...

732
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,587
…and afraid of failing her OWLs
because he cares about everything.

733
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,384
One person couldn’t feel all that.
They would explode.

734
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,984
Just because you have
the feeling of a teaspoon...

735
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,784
Harry.

736
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,184
Voldemort probably wants something.

737
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,590
Something he didn’t have last season.

738
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,786
Harry.

739
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,386
Harry.

740
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,190
In the dream,
Were you standing next to the victim...

741
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,986
…or do you see it at the bottom of the picture?

742
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,390
In. Elki came to...

743
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,584
Will you just tell me?
occurred?

744
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,989
Everard, Arthur is on guard tonight.

745
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,389
Make sure it shows
with the right people.

746
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,186
- Lord.
- Phineas.

747
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,589
You need to go to your picture
at Grimmauld Place.

748
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,194
Tell them about Arthur Weasley
he's so sick...

749
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,387
…and his kids will get there
immediately via Portkey.

750
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,392
They've got him, Albus.
It was close, but they think he’ll make it.

751
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,994
What’s more,
the Dark Lord failed to defeat him.

752
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,991
Oh, thank you. Then you have to...

753
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,786
Look at me!

754
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,187
What is happening to me?

755
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,986
Did you want to see me, Master?”

756
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,188
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait any longer.
Not even until morning.

757
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,590
Otherwise, we will all be vulnerable.

758
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,192
There appears to be a connection…

759
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,589
...half the Dark Lord's mind
and yours.

760
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,991
If he is, so far, aware of this
the connection, at this point, is unclear.

761
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,992
Pray he remains unaware.

762
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,584
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

763
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,991
...he can read my mind?
- Read, order...

764
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,991
...open it.

765
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,390
In the past, it was often
the darkness that fascinates him...

766
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,584
…to challenge their victim mindset…

767
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,787
…creating views created by
to torture them to death.

768
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,990
We have just released the last of the best
ounce of pressure...

769
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,187
…as soon as he had them
asks for death, then...

770
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,986
...kill them.

771
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,789
Use it wisely,
the power of Occlumency…

772
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,384
…will help protect you
input or control.

773
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,383
In this tutorial, I will try
to get into your mind.

774
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,790
You will try to defend yourself.

775
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,791
Get ready.

776
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,586
Legilimens.

777
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,787
Settle down, Potter. Perspective.

778
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,184
You, you, you. Merry christmas.

779
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,394
Here we go.

780
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,994
My father came back.

781
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,184
Sit down, everyone, take a seat.
That's it. Now, gifts.

782
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,990
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

783
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,389
Fred and George. Come on, open it.

784
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,789
- I want to see your faces.
- Whether.

785
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,189
- Try it.
- Thank you, Mom. It’s really perfect.

786
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,387
- Just what he wanted, of course.
- Whether. Right. Thank you, Mom.

787
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,392
Come on, then, everyone.
Let's get this out of the way.

788
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,391
Oh, Harry, Harry.

789
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,994
There you are.

790
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,589
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

791
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,591
- It's great to have you with us.
- Thank you.

792
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,591
Now, Daddy. Pass that to my father.

793
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,386
- Thank you.
- Does everyone have it?

794
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,788
Fred? George?

795
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,394
- Hermione.
- A Christmas Carol.

796
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,789
For Mr. Harry Potter…

797
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,590
…without that I wouldn’t be here.

798
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,789
- Harry.
- Harry.

799
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,586
Harry.

800
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,594
That’s so sweet.
I’m going to need some of that.

801
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,387
Dad, don’t forget last Christmas.

802
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,985
I can't understand
why don't you want to add it, Ronald.

803
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,791
I look like a complete idiot, that’s why.

804
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,586
Less than usual, Ron.

805
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,989
I don't know why...

806
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,785
Too bad, standing there
such as brass.

807
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,385
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

808
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,790
fellow Mudbloods
and those who fight blood together.

809
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,394
- What my poor friend only knew...
- Kreacher!

810
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,187
That’s enough of your bile.
Stay with you!

811
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,384
Yes, Master.

812
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,383
Kreacher lives to serve
the ideal Black home.

813
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,389
Sorry about that.

814
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,393
It was never very pleasant,
since I was a boy.

815
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,994
Not for me, though.

816
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,191
What, you grew up here?

817
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,589
This is my parents' house.

818
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,991
I gave it to Dumbledore
as the headquarters of the Order.

819
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,188
Which is the only thing that matters
I was able to do it.

820
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,792
This is the Black Tree.

821
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,184
My bad cousin.

822
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,987
I hated that many of them.

823
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,188
My parents with their love of white.

824
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,787
My mom did that when I ran away.

825
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,789
Beautiful woman.

826
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,584
I was 16 years old.

827
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,791
Where did you go?

828
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,986
Surround your father.

829
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,792
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

830
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,385
I see it so much in you, Harry.

831
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,187
You two are so much alike.

832
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,789
I don’t really know.

833
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,186
Sirius, when I was...

834
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:40,383
When I saw Mr. Weasley was attacked,
I wasn’t just watching.

835
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,984
I was the snake.

836
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,192
And then, in Dumbledore’s office…

837
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,785
…there was a moment
when I wanted to...

838
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,390
This relationship
between me and Voldemort.

839
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,587
What if the reason for
Am I really acting like him?

840
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,990
I just feel so angry all the time.

841
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,585
And what if, after all
my experience...

842
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,593
…what went wrong with me?
What if I turn out to be bad?

843
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,184
I want you to listen to me
That’s great, Harry.

844
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,190
You're not a bad person.

845
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,190
You are a very nice person
what bad things have happened to them.

846
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,986
Do you understand?

847
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,383
Also, the world is not divide
on good people and on death.

848
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:44,190
We all have light and dark
in ourselves.

849
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,984
Important
it’s the part we choose to play.

850
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,187
That's really who we are.

851
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,389
Harry, time to go.

852
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,791
When all this is over,
we will be a good family.

853
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,791
Tickets.

854
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,186
Come on.

855
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,783
Really?

856
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,587
Harry. Harry.

857
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,989
Hagrid turned.

858
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,589
I'm sorry.

859
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,990
I will say this is a last minute.

860
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,389
I command you to tell me
where you were.

861
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,585
I told you. I lived away for my health.

862
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,787
- Your body?
- Whether. A bit of fresh air, you know.

863
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,988
Oh, yes. As a caregiver,
It must be hard to get fresh air.

864
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,994
If I were you,
I shouldn’t be so used to turning around.

865
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,584
Yeah, I probably wouldn’t care
open everything.

866
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,784
This is a big secret, isn’t it?

867
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,594
Dumbledore sent me
to communicate with the giants.

868
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,591
Giants?

869
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,189
Did you find them?

870
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:04,591
Well, it’s not that hard to find,
to be completely honest. Pretty big, you see?

871
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,792
I tried to encourage them
to join the process.

872
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,985
But I wasn’t the only one
that he wanted to conquer.

873
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,384
- Fatal?
- Whether.

874
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:17,188
I want to encourage them
to connect with You-Know-Who.

875
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,589
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's words.

876
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,991
Let’s talk about some of their memories
he was kind to them. I think so.

877
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,786
And this is what they did to you?

878
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,984
Not really, no.

879
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,391
Oh, go ahead, you have, then,
it's dozy chick.

880
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,589
That’s where it’s changed.

881
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,784
That’s what happened.

882
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,784
There's a storm coming, Harry.

883
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,384
We’ll all be better prepared when he does.

884
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,385
We hope
the 10 most secure prisons...

885
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,187
…in the early hours of last night
cholok.

886
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,784
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
he has been warned of the danger.

887
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,587
We think so much...

888
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,791
…that the flight was engineering…

889
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,987
…with a man with experience
on the escape from Azkaban…

890
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,585
…the notorious murderer Sirius Black…

891
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:03,190
...fugitive cousin Bellatrix Lestrange.

892
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,784
Dumbledore told Fudge
this could happen.

893
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,985
He’s going to kill us all
simply because he cannot face the truth.

894
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,786
Harry.

895
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,189
I wanted to apologize.

896
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,387
Now even my mother says the prophet
versions of objects are not synchronized.

897
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:35,589
So, what I really mean is
it’s because I believe in you.

898
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,784
Neville?

899
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,384
Fourteen years ago...

900
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,791
...a death eater
Her name is Bellatrix Lestrange…

901
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,384
...they used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

902
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,393
He tortured them to find out...

903
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,994
…but they never surrendered.

904
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,992
I am so proud to be their son.

905
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,587
But I don’t know
This is being prepared for everyone to know now.

906
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,385
You’ll make them proud, Neville.
That’s a commitment.

907
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,384
Make a good impression,
the happiest you can remember.

908
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,984
Let it fill you.
Keep it up, Seamus.

909
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,786
George, now’s your turn.

910
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,387
Expecto Patronum.

911
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,190
A Patronus with a lot of physicality
is the hardest thing to do...

912
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,988
...but shields can be just as
relevant to a variety of players.

913
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,786
Wow, that was really good.

914
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,586
Well done, Ginny.

915
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,593
Just remember, your Patronus can only
it will protect you as long as you stay focused.

916
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,387
So buckle up, Luna.

917
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,186
Think about what you like best.

918
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,191
Expecto Patronum.

919
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,987
- I'm trying.
- I know. Good.

920
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,790
This is great stuff, guys.
You're doing really well.

921
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,792
Expecto Patronum.

922
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,392
I’m going to make a short work of this.

923
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,594
Bombarda Maxima.

924
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,186
Get them.

925
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,792
I’ve been watching them for weeks.

926
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,984
And look, "Dumbledore's Army"...

927
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,187
…proof of what I’m telling you
from the beginning, Cornelius.

928
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,991
All your fears
from You-Know-Who...

929
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,592
…he never lied to us for a minute.

930
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,784
We identified common scams that were:

931
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,588
A firewall for your business
to take orders from the Ministry.

932
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,783
That's right.

933
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,394
No, Master.
He had nothing to do with it. I was.

934
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,984
How nice of you, Harry, to save us,
but as has been said...

935
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,790
…the paper clearly states
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

936
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,587
I advised Harry
to create this organization.

937
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,990
And I, and only I,
this is controlled by action.

938
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,991
Send a dog to the Daily Prophet.

939
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,594
If we hurry,
we still have to do the morning edition.

940
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,390
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you take Dumbledore...

941
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,186
...the Azkabans...

942
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,988
...to await judgment
for reconciliation and competition.

943
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,390
I thought maybe we could find these little gems.

944
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,788
You seem to be working
onto the trick I’m going to…

945
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,392
What was the message?

946
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,992
Come in peace.

947
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,991
Well, I can tell you this:

948
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,389
I don’t want to go to Azkaban.

949
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,186
That’s it.

950
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,792
Take it.

951
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,791
Well, you might not like it, Minister…

952
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,394
…but you can’t ignore it…

953
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,585
…Dumbledore has his own style.

954
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,785
Teenagers are not allowed
to be within eight inches of each other.

955
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,190
Interested participants
the Inquisitorial Squad for more rewards...

956
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:36,183
Students will be referred to interview
that they think they are doing wrong.

957
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,990
Any student who disagrees
will be released.

958
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,784
Harry.

959
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,190
You did everything you could.
No one could defeat the old man.

960
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,987
Even Dumbledore
didn’t see that coming.

961
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,584
Harry, if it’s anyone’s fault, it’s ours.

962
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,784
Yes, we warned you.

963
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,189
Yeah, but I got it.

964
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:14,785
I tried to help,
and has only made it worse.

965
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,987
However, that no longer matters.

966
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,587
Because I don't want to fight anymore.
It just makes you more anxious.

967
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,387
And the more you care,
you should definitely miss it.

968
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,984
- So maybe it's just a little better...
- Why?

969
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,989
To not go alone.

970
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,784
Hagrid.

971
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,194
Do you know where to take us?

972
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,784
Hagrid, why can't you just tell me?

973
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,787
I’ve never seen centaurs this angry before.

974
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,792
And they are dangerous
at the best of times.

975
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,589
The Ministry prohibits
their land is so much...

976
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,784
…will have an interesting fight
in their hands.

977
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,586
Hagrid, what's going on?

978
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,989
I’m sorry it’s so private, you three.

979
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,188
I won't bother you with that,
but with Dumbledore gone…

980
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,385
...I can get the sack
any day now.

981
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,393
And I couldn’t go
she won’t tell anyone about him.

982
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,984
Grawpy.

983
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,394
Down here, you’re the big guy.

984
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,984
Grawpy.

985
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,384
He took you to some meetings.

986
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,989
I couldn't just leave it, because...

987
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,786
Because he's my brother.

988
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,188
Blimey.

989
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,191
Well, brother, of course.

990
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:09,786
He’s completely out of touch, like I said.
A little too good, everyone.

991
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,789
- Grawpy, that's not good.
- Hagrid, do something.

992
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:16,189
We were talking about this.
You haven’t, have you?

993
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,589
It's your new best friend, Hermione.

994
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,386
Grawpy.

995
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,586
Look.

996
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,584
Put me down.

997
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,584
Now.

998
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,192
Are you okay?

999
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,991
Good.

1000
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,184
All you need is a steady hand, that’s all.

1001
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,192
I think you have someone to thank.

1002
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,594
Just stay away from him, okay?

1003
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,185
He gets his food and everything.

1004
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,384
That’s the friend you’ll need
when I'm gone.

1005
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,594
You’ll take care of it, won’t you?

1006
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,785
I'm the only family that has it.

1007
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,589
Are you sad?

1008
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,193
- It's closed.
- Not at all.

1009
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,988
And not against the Dark Lord,
if you don’t prepare.

1010
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,985
Any knowledge that contains
it’s a weapon that can be used against you.

1011
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,585
You won’t last two seconds
if he enters your mind.

1012
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,384
You are just like your father.

1013
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,391
Lazy, very arrogant.

1014
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,584
- Don't say a word about my father.
- Weak.

1015
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,387
- I'm not kidding.
- Then prove it.

1016
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,391
Control your emotions.

1017
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,790
Fix your mind.

1018
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,592
Legilimens.

1019
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,183
Harry.

1020
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,384
Sirius.

1021
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,992
I might get shocked.

1022
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,592
Stop it.

1023
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,794
Is this what you call authority?

1024
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,985
We’ve been together for hours.
If only I could relax.

1025
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,788
The Night King does not rest.

1026
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,791
You and Black, both of you together.

1027
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,793
Depressed children often cry about
it’s so unfair in your situation.

1028
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,985
Well, you may not know,
but life isn’t fair.

1029
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,993
Your blessed father knew that.
Of course, he used to see it.

1030
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,584
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a pig.

1031
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,991
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

1032
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,392
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1033
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,584
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1034
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,591
Well said, James.

1035
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,989
- Dad.
- Impedes.

1036
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,991
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1037
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,787
Right. Who wants to see me
take Snivelly’s clothes off?

1038
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,189
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1039
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,792
Enough.

1040
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,384
Enough.

1041
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,587
Your lesson is over.

1042
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,783
L...

1043
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,588
Get out.

1044
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,584
- What is your name?
- Michael.

1045
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,591
Your hand will be fine, Michael.

1046
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,785
Whether. It's not as bad as it looks. See?

1047
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,791
It’s over.

1048
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,988
You can't see ours anymore,
and the pain subsides after a short time.

1049
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,187
As I told you once, Mr. Potter…

1050
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:44,387
...bad children
they deserve to be punished.

1051
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,188
You know, George…

1052
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:51,988
…I always feel our future is out there
the world of competitive education.

1053
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,790
Fred, I thought
same thing.

1054
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,384
Hello, teacher!

1055
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,584
Here you go.

1056
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,389
Be prepared while you’re at it.

1057
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,185
I love the quote.

1058
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,589
You have to kill me.

1059
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:15,385
Oh, I will.
But first you bring it to me.

1060
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,584
Crucio.

1061
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,789
Crucio.

1062
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,592
Sirius.

1063
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,783
Harry, you know?

1064
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,189
I saw it. It’s like with Mr. Weasley.

1065
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,191
It is the door I dreamed of.

1066
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,384
I couldn’t remember
where I’ve seen it before.

1067
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,391
Sirius said Voldemort
it was after something.

1068
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,585
Something he didn’t have last season,
in the Department of Mysteries.

1069
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,194
Harry, please, just listen.

1070
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,389
What if Voldemort
does it mean for you to see this?

1071
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,385
What if it just hurts Sirius
because he wants to get to you?

1072
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,790
What if he is?
Should I just let him die?

1073
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,793
Hermione,
it’s the only family I have left.

1074
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,192
What are we doing?

1075
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,786
We need to use the Floo Network.

1076
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,791
Umbridge has the fireplaces
security guards.

1077
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,984
Not all of them.

1078
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,991
Alohomora.

1079
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,986
Let them know the rules if you can.

1080
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,390
- Are you smart? We're going with you.
- It's dangerous.

1081
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:37,188
When you get
in your head? We’re in this together.

1082
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,385
So are you.

1083
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,790
I caught this one
he wanted to help Miss Weasley.

1084
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,184
It would be Dumbledore,
No?

1085
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,191
- No.
- They're lying.

1086
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:55,192
- You sent me, Master?
- Snape, yes.

1087
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,784
It’s time to answer, if
does he want to give it to me or not.

1088
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,392
Did you take the Veritaserum?

1089
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,392
I’m afraid you’re done
all of my stores require interns.

1090
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:06,984
The last of those on Miss Chang.

1091
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,992
Unless you want to mess with it...

1092
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,790
And I’m telling you, I wish
the great love if you did.

1093
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,189
I can't help you.

1094
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,184
He has Padfoot.

1095
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,388
He’s got Padfoot on the spot
where he's hiding.

1096
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,584
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where is he hiding?

1097
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,591
What does it say, Snape?

1098
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,994
I don’t know.

1099
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,784
Very good.

1100
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,794
You give me no choice, Potter.

1101
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,792
Because this is a Ministry security matter…

1102
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,394
...leaving us with...

1103
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,994
…there is no alternative.

1104
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,384
The Curse of the Cruciatus
You have to open your mouth.

1105
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,389
That’s illegal.

1106
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,393
What Cornelius doesn’t know
it won’t do anything.

1107
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,991
Tell him, Harry!

1108
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,791
Tell me what?

1109
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,789
Well, if you don’t tell him where it is…

1110
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,184
...I will.

1111
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,589
Where is it?

1112
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,787
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1113
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,786
How far away?

1114
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,984
Not far.

1115
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:41,387
It had to be somewhere
students would not find it for nothing.

1116
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,592
What are you doing?

1117
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,784
Lmprovising.

1118
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,584
Good?

1119
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,794
Where is this tool?

1120
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,787
There isn’t one, is there?

1121
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,394
You tried to fool me.

1122
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,984
You know...

1123
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,189
…I really hate kids.

1124
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:41,390
You have nothing here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1125
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,186
Lower your weapon.

1126
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:50,593
I am telling you what the law of Moses says.
as animals with almost human intelligence…

1127
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,192
Protego.

1128
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,792
How confident are you?

1129
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,791
Love half breed.

1130
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,592
They are imprisoned.

1131
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,387
Please. Stop. Please.

1132
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:17,383
Now, that’s it. I will have control.

1133
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,794
You are a dirty animal.

1134
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:30,792
Do you know who I am?

1135
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,792
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1136
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,189
No, he doesn't understand.

1137
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,390
Potter, do something.
Tell them I don't want to hurt them.

1138
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,391
Excuse me, Master.

1139
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,391
But I shouldn't lie.

1140
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,389
What are you doing?

1141
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:55,587
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1142
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,194
Let me go!

1143
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:02,191
Thanks, Grawp.

1144
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:05,988
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1145
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:16,984
- How did you escape?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn’t pretty.

1146
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,184
I told them I was hungry,
he wanted some food.

1147
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,192
They told me to stop
and ate the draw themselves.

1148
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,584
That was smart, Ron.

1149
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,189
- It's known what's going to happen.
- It was very good.

1150
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,589
How do we get to London?

1151
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:34,393
Look, it’s not that I don’t appreciate
everything you’ve done, all of you…

1152
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:37,194
...but I've got you
in many cases as it is.

1153
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,385
Dumbledore's army should be
of doing something real.

1154
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,994
Or was it just words to you?

1155
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,988
You probably don’t need to do this
all alone, my friend.

1156
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,787
How do we get to London?

1157
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,187
You’re kidding, of course.

1158
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,194
Department of Mysteries.

1159
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,384
Appropriate.

1160
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,387
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1161
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,391
Ninety-four.

1162
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,592
Ninety-five.

1163
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,185
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1164
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,191
It has your name on it.

1165
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:44,390
The powerful
to defeat the Dark Lord approaches.

1166
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:47,194
And the Dark Lord
marking him as a friend...

1167
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,385
…but he will be strong
the darkness does not know.

1168
01:43:55,200 --> 01:44:00,991
Because no one can live
while the other is alive.

1169
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,392
Harry.

1170
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,592
Where is Sirius?

1171
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:20,993
You know, you really have to learn
to talk about dream stuff…

1172
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,794
…and the truth.

1173
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:31,793
We just saw that The Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1174
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,392
Now, give me the translation.

1175
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,994
If he does anything to me, I will cut him off.

1176
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:40,794
He knows how to fight.

1177
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:44,588
Itty, bitty baby.

1178
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,192
Potter.

1179
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,191
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1180
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,192
Neville Longbottom, right?
How are my mom and dad?

1181
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,589
Fortunately, they are now about to be returned.

1182
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,783
Now, let’s all sit down…

1183
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,392
...shall we?

1184
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,994
We just want the explanation.

1185
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,184
Why would Voldemort
Should I come and get this?

1186
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,384
Do you mean his name?

1187
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,986
You half-blooded piece of dirt!

1188
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,992
It's all good.
He’s just a curious boy, right?

1189
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:21,793
The argument can only be returned
that they are what they are made of.

1190
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:24,985
Which is great for you, of course.

1191
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,184
Haven’t you always wondered…

1192
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:35,786
…which was the reason for the decision
between you and the Dark Lord?

1193
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,594
Somehow he couldn't kill you...

1194
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,592
...when you were just a kid?

1195
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:47,388
Don’t you want to know
secret of your scar?

1196
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:52,590
All the answers are right there, Potter,
in your hand.

1197
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,589
All you have to do is…

1198
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,784
...give it to me.

1199
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:01,588
Then I can show you everything.

1200
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:11,584
I’ve been waiting 14 years.

1201
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,386
I know.

1202
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:17,192
I think I can wait a little longer.
Now. Be afraid.

1203
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,986
Be afraid.

1204
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,592
Levicorpus.

1205
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,384
Petrifico Totalus.

1206
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,584
Well done, Neville.

1207
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,191
Be afraid.

1208
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,992
- You're wrong.
- You're wrong.

1209
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:10,589
Be afraid.

1210
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,987
Reduct.

1211
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,394
Go back to the door.

1212
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:15,583
Department of Mysteries.
They got the product right, didn’t they?

1213
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,389
The language.

1214
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,789
Can you tell what they're saying?

1215
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,594
No words, Harry.

1216
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,591
Let's get out of here.

1217
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,591
I hear them too.

1218
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,185
Harry, it’s just an empty arc.

1219
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,191
Please, Harry.

1220
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,789
Stand behind me.

1221
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,587
Did you really believe...

1222
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:36,390
…or are you really smart
to think...

1223
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:41,986
… that kids had a chance
in front of us?

1224
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,987
I'll keep this simple, Potter.

1225
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,185
Give me the answer right now...

1226
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:59,785
…or watch your friends die.

1227
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,386
Don't give it away, Harry.

1228
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,390
Stay away from my baby.

1229
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,387
So now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1230
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,391
What is? No, I'm staying with you.

1231
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:17,585
You've done a beautiful job.

1232
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,386
Now, let me pick up from here.

1233
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:20,992
Black.

1234
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,788
Expelliarmus!

1235
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,791
Well said, James.

1236
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,991
Avada Kedavra.

1237
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,587
Nope. Nope.

1238
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,185
I killed Sirius Black.

1239
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,989
- Are you coming to pick me up?
- Crucio.

1240
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:02,385
You have to say it, Harry.

1241
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,587
He killed her. He deserves it.

1242
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:13,384
You know the words, Harry.

1243
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,984
Do it.

1244
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,190
Very weak.

1245
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:45,385
It was stupid of you
to come tonight, Tom.

1246
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:47,186
The Aurors are on their way.

1247
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:51,785
At that time I will go, and you...

1248
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,394
...die.

1249
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,989
You’re wrong, old man.

1250
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,192
Harry.

1251
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,591
Very weak.

1252
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:34,194
So it’s really bad.

1253
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:39,392
Look at me.

1254
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:45,387
Harry, it's not like you two are the same.

1255
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:48,392
That way you’re not.

1256
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:54,591
Harry?

1257
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,991
You are weak...

1258
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,585
…and you’ll never know
love or affection.

1259
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,590
And I love you.

1260
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:03,193
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1261
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:08,986
And you will lose everything.

1262
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,784
He turned away.

1263
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:30,986
I know how you feel, Harry.

1264
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,184
No, no.

1265
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,388
It's my fault.

1266
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:43,188
No, the fault is mine.

1267
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,386
I knew it was just a matter of time…

1268
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:48,984
…before Voldemort made the connection
among you.

1269
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:53,387
I thought by getting away from you,
like I’ve been doing all year…

1270
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:58,986
…he wouldn’t be so impressed,
and therefore you can be more protected.

1271
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,788
The report said:

1272
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:09,191
“No one can live
while the other is still alive."

1273
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:16,394
It means one of our
He’ll have to kill the other one, in the end.

1274
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:19,591
Whether.

1275
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:21,192
Why didn't you tell me?

1276
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:24,988
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1277
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,787
The only thing is your friends saved your life.

1278
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,584
After all these years,
after all you’ve been through…

1279
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:34,990
…didn’t mean to make you
no more suffering.

1280
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:38,394
I was so worried about you.

1281
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:03,989
Why aren’t you at this party?

1282
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,585
I lost everything I had.
Apparently people are hiding them.

1283
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,783
It’s really bad.

1284
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:11,586
Oh, it’s all good fun.

1285
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:15,184
But since the night has come,
I really need to be brought back.

1286
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:17,987
Need help finding them?

1287
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:23,988
My apologies to your father, Harry.

1288
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,184
Are you sure you don’t want
a help are you looking for?

1289
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:33,986
That's all good.

1290
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,184
However, my mother always said…

1291
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:40,591
…loss has a way of
which will return to us in the end.

1292
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,788
If not always in the way we think.

1293
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:50,785
Guess I’m just going to go have some pudding.

1294
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:27,392
I've thought of something
Dumbledore told me.

1295
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,584
What is it?

1296
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,387
Though
we have a fight ahead of us...

1297
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:35,585
…we have something
which Voldemort does not have.

1298
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,591
Whether?

1299
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:41,587
Something worth fighting for.

2
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,570
I killed Sirius Black!

3
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,570
He turned away.

4
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,570
The police are
continue with the research….

5
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,570
….in that case
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

6
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:04,647
The war has stopped
as police search for survivors.

7
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,420
The surrounding area remains closed.

8
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:09,756
The mayor asked Londoners to remain calm….

9
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,429
"Harry Potter."

10
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,514
Who is Harry Potter?

11
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:22,059
Oh, nobody.

12
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,040
A bit of a tosser, for sure.

13
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,211
Well, that’s your book.

14
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:31,026
A couple of nights ago,
I could say I saw a moving picture.

15
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,945
~ Really?
~ I thought I was walking the wave.

16
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:45,206
~ Hey, I thought….
~ Eleven. That's when I get off.

17
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:48,229
You can tell me all about
the Harry Potter tosser.

18
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,299
You’ve been struggling lately, Harry.

19
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:43,802
I love traveling on trains.

20
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:46,930
It takes my mind off things.

21
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:50,370
It’s not a good look, is it?

22
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,915
The story is so inspiring,
if I do say so myself.

23
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,626
But now is not the time to tell.

24
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,399
Take my hand off.

25
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,299
Do as I say.

26
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,830
I’m just Apparated, right?

27
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,166
Indeed. Even better, I might say.

28
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,981
Most people cringe the first time.

29
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,962
I can’t imagine why.

30
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:33,431
Welcome to the
beautiful Budleigh Babberton.

31
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:37,810
Harry, I think, by now, you are wondering why I brought you here.

32
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,687
Is what I’m saying true?

33
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:43,232
Yes, sir, after all these years, I just want to do it.

34
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,696
Get out, Harry.

35
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,521
Horace?

36
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,075
Horace?

37
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,667
Merlin’s head!

38
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:13,107
You don't have to trouble us, Albus.

39
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:16,965
Well, I have to say you
make a very comfortable chair, Horace.

40
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:22,283
It’s all on the surface. I come up with the recipe on my own. What did he give me?

41
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,202
Dragon's blood.

42
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,747
~ Oh.
~ Oh, yes, class.

43
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,917
Harry, I’d like you to meet an old friend and colleague….

44
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,481
....Horace Slughorn.

45
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,150
Horace….

46
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:39,173
....well, you know who I am.

47
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,988
Harry Potter.

48
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:46,576
What’s with all the theatrics, Horace?

49
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:49,183
Weren’t you, in some ways, expecting another one?

50
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:51,893
Anyone else?
I'm honestly not sure what you mean.

51
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,751
Well, the Death Eaters are trying to recruit me
per year.

52
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,315
Do you know what that means?

53
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,173
You can just say no more often, so I’ll never stay anywhere again
of a week.

54
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,675
Muggles that have this
is located in the Canary Islands.

55
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:08,784
Well, I think we should bring it back to their own terms, don’t you? Mind.

56
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,276
That was beautiful.

57
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:49,238
~ Do you mind if I use the loo?
~ No, really.

58
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:53,200
Don't think I don't know
why are you here, Albus.

59
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:58,935
The answer is still no.
True and not, no.

60
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,361
You are exactly like your father.

61
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,428
~ With his eyes only. You have your….
~ My mother's eyes. Whether.

62
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:17,285
Lily. Quality Lily. He was
so bright, your mother.

63
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,726
Even more surprising considering she was Muggle-born.

64
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,541
One of my best friends is Muggle-born. Especially at our age.

65
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,731
Please don't think I'm jealous. No, no.

66
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:30,110
Your mother was one of my
which I really like. Look, there he is.

67
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,091
Straight ahead.

68
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:43,560
It’s all mine. Each and every one.

69
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:45,749
Dear teachers, I would like to say.

70
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:52,422
Meet Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet.

71
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:55,759
He always takes my dog,
I should like to write a comment….

72
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,218
….in the context of the times.

73
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:01,076
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

74
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,683
Free tickets whenever I want.

75
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,915
Of course, I am not
in a battle at some point.

76
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,147
Ah, yes.

77
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,441
Regulus Black.

78
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,611
No doubt you know about his older brother Sirius. He died a few weeks ago.

79
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,322
I taught the entire Black family, except for Sirius.

80
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,720
It's a real shame. Smart boy.

81
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:27,142
I got Regulus when it came, yes, but I would have liked the set.

82
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,227
Horace?

83
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:31,521
Do you know if I take this?

84
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:39,758
~ I love art.
~ Yes, of course. But won’t you go?

85
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:42,990
I think I recognize something lost when I see one. It’s very sad.

86
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,492
I would think
a personal victory….

87
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,620
....if you wanted to go back to Hogwarts. Oh, okay.

88
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,748
You are like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind.

89
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,146
Well, goodbye, Horace.

90
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,440
Bye.

91
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,994
All right. I'll do it.

92
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:14,686
But I prefer Professor Merrythought’s old work, not the water
punishment that I had before.

93
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:19,065
And I expect a result.
These are the most dangerous times we live in. Crazy!

94
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,506
Of course they are.

95
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:27,823
Sir, what was all that about?

96
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:33,037
You are wise, knowledgeable and powerful. Everything Horace values.

97
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:36,686
Professor Slughorn would like to meet with you, Harry.

98
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,188
You would be his crown jewel.

99
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:44,923
So he returns to Hogwarts. And it’s important that it comes back.

100
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:48,780
I’m afraid I might be cheating
good evening to you, Harry.

101
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:53,994
She was, of course, very beautiful, the girl.

102
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:57,539
All right, sir. I'll be back tomorrow, make a mistake.

103
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:01,396
Oh, you're not going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

104
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:04,628
But, sir, what about Hedwig? And my tree?

105
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,444
Both are waiting for you.

106
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,476
Hedwig.

107
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,334
Mom?

108
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,045
Ginny, what is that?

109
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:51,756
I just thought
when Harry got here.

110
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,092
~ What? Harry? Harry who?
~ Harry Potter, of course.

111
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:58,429
I think I would know if Harry Potter was in my room, wouldn’t you?

112
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:02,182
~ His back is in the kitchen, and ​his back.
~ No, my friend, I really think so.

113
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,457
Harry? Who said "Harry"?

114
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,542
Nah, nosy. Is he up there with you?

115
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,774
Of course not. I would know if my best friend was in my room, right?

116
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,381
~ Is that a dog?
~ You haven’t seen him, have you?

117
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,362
He walks around the house.

118
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,239
~ Really?
~ True.

119
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,115
Harry!

120
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,039
Harry!

121
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,812
Hello.

122
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,253
What a beautiful surprise.

123
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:37,632
Why didn't you tell me
were you coming?

124
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,655
~ I didn't know. Dumbledore.
~ Oh, the man.

125
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,053
But then, what would we
if not him?

126
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:47,015
I have some toothpaste.

127
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,669
When did you get here?

128
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,546
A few days ago.

129
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:00,778
At least to some extent,
I didn’t know I was coming.

130
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,844
My mom lost it last week.

131
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:07,972
He said Ginny and I didn't have enough to go back to Hogwarts.

132
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,536
That’s how dangerous it is.

133
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,560
~ Oh, come on.
~ Not alone.

134
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:16,001
Even my parents, and ​they are Muggles, know something is wrong.

135
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:20,067
However, my father came in,
told him he was barmy….

136
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,778
….and a few days passed, but he came back.

137
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:28,095
But this is Hogwarts we’re talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be more reliable?

138
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:31,953
Right now there’s a lot of talk about….

139
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:34,351
….Dumbledore has aged a little.

140
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,332
Trash! Well, he just….

141
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,105
What is it?

142
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:41,441
One hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

143
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:05,422
Cissy! You can't do this!
We can't trust him!

144
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,986
The Dark Lord is confident.

145
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:10,739
~ The Dark Lord is confused.
~ Pfft.

146
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,331
Run, Wormtail.

147
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,753
I know I shouldn't be here.

148
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,715
The darkness itself
stopped me from talking about this.

149
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:54,530
If the dark shadows are holding you back, you don’t have to talk.

150
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:58,909
Put it on, Bella.
We can't take what doesn't belong to us.

151
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,729
As it happens,
I feel for you, Narcissa.

152
00:16:06,937 --> 00:16:08,084
You?

153
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,525
Did the Night King tell you?

154
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,653
Your sister amazes me.

155
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:18,510
You can understand. Over the years I have done well in my career.

156
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:22,368
So, I cheated
one of the greatest magicians of all time.

157
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:27,790
Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would ask.

158
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,875
I'm not thinking about you, Severus.

159
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:33,212
You deserve respect, Cissy. Like Draco.

160
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:39,467
Just a boy.

161
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:43,325
I can’t change the Dark Lord’s mind.

162
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:48,643
But you can
for me to help Draco.

163
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:53,335
~ Severus.
~ Swear.

164
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,799
Make that commitment you can’t break.

165
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:06,785
It's just nonsense.

166
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:10,121
He will do everything he can.

167
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,623
But when it matters….

168
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,462
….he’ll just go back to his hole.

169
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,571
Coward.

170
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:30,244
Take out your stick.

171
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:44,528
Do you….

172
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:46,822
….Severus Snape….

173
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:49,845
….see Draco Malfoy….

174
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:54,850
....like he's trying to do the Dark Lord's bidding?

175
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:57,874
I will.

176
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,983
And you,
to the best of our ability….

177
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,798
....protect you from harm?

178
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:08,613
I will.

179
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:13,200
And if Draco fails….

180
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:18,935
….do the work yourself….

181
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:24,148
....the dark lord
ordered Draco to do it?

182
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:30,821
I will.

183
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:56,678
Stop! Stop!
We have Fanting Fancies!

184
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:57,825
Nosebleed Nougats!

185
00:18:58.03 4 --> 00:19:01,057
~ And just in time for school….
~ Puking Pastilles!

186
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:05,124
~ In the dust, beautiful.
~ In the dust, beautiful.

187
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:08,356
I will have control!

188
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,944
I really hate children. I will have control!

189
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,948
I really hate children. I will have control!

190
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:22,014
~ Peruvian Instant Darkening Powder.
~ A real money maker, that is.

191
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,308
Help yourself if you want
for immediate protection.

192
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,185
~ Hello, ladies.
~ Hello, ladies.

193
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:29,626
~ Love potions, eh?
~ Yes, they really work.

194
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:33,171
Then, as you can hear, sis, you’re fine being alone.

195
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,526
Mean?

196
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,820
Aren’t you
Are you currently dating Dean Thomas?

197
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:39,009
None of your business.

198
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:45,787
How much for this?

199
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,351
~ Five Galleons.
~ Five Galleons.

200
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,644
~ How much for me?
~ Five Galleons.

201
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:51,000
I am my brother.

202
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,398
~ Ten galleons.
~ Ten Galleons.

203
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,047
Come on, let's go.

204
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:00,905
Well done, Ron.

205
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:02,990
Hello.

206
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:20,194
How are Fred and George
have you done? Half the street is blocked off.

207
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:22,904
Fred thinks
people need a laugh these days.

208
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,407
I think he's right.

209
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,743
No.

210
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,558
Everyone got their sticks
of Ollivander's.

211
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,425
Harry?

212
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:49,283
Is it me, or do Draco and my mother look like two people….

213
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:51,160
....who doesn't want to be chased?

214
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:37,717
Quibbler.

215
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:41,054
Quibbler.

216
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:47,727
She’s so beautiful. They’re known for playing on Boxing Day, you know.

217
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:50,229
~ Quibbler?
~ Oh, please.

218
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,982
~ What is a Wrackspurt?
~ They are invisible creatures.

219
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,319
They float in your ears
and keep your mind sharp.

220
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,404
Quibbler.

221
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:12,646
So, what was Draco doing
with the cabinet looking weird?

222
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,522
And who were all those people?

223
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,755
Don't you see?
It was a party, a class.

224
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,840
Stop, Harry.
I know where you're going.

225
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:22,551
It’s happening. He is one of them.

226
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,219
One of what?

227
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:28,389
Harry thinks Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

228
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,579
You’re playing.

229
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,873
What you-know-who
do you want it with Malfoy?

230
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:37,043
Well, what’s he doing at Borgin and Burkes? Looking for furniture?

231
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:39,129
It’s a horror store. He’s a scary guy.

232
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:43,091
Look, his father is a monster. It just makes sense.

233
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,863
Hermione looked him in the eye.

234
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:48,408
I told you I don't know what I saw.

235
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:51,640
I need some fresh air.

236
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:12,180
Don't worry. When we get
at Hogwarts, we will continue.

237
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:35,848
~ What was that? Blaise?
~ I don't know.

238
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:39,080
Relax, boys. Maybe it’s just a first-year game.

239
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:42,625
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

240
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:56,075
Hogwarts.
What bad news for a school.

241
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:58,265
I would jump
the Astronomy Tower….

242
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,559
….if I had to continue
for another two years.

243
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,123
What does that mean?

244
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:07,231
Let’s just say you won’t see me wasting my time on Charms class next year.

245
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:10,776
Are you happy, Blaise?

246
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:14,634
We’ll see who laughs in the end.

247
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:40,596
You guys go ahead.
I want to see something.

248
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:44,036
Where is Harry?

249
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:47,164
Maybe it’s already on the platform. Come on.

250
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:06,349
Did Mom ever tell you
was it awkward to listen to, Potter?

251
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:08,121
Petrifico Totalus.

252
00:26:19,382 --> 00:26:20,842
Oh, yes….

253
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:24,491
.... he was dead before you wiped the drool off your nose.

254
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:33,145
It's for my father.
Enjoy your journey back to London.

255
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,812
Finished.

256
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,215
~ Good morning, Harry.
~ Luna!

257
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:31,324
~ How did you know where I lived?
~ Wrackspurts. Your head is full of them.

258
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:40,708
Sorry to have missed you
the cars, by the way, Luna.

259
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:44,044
That's all good.
It was like I was with a friend.

260
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:46,233
Oh, I’m your friend, Luna.

261
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:48,423
That's nice.

262
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:51,759
Like the weather. I've been looking everywhere for you two.

263
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:54,783
Right. His name?

264
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:57,390
Professor Flitwick,
you’ve known me for five years.

265
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:59,683
It's okay, Potter.

266
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:01,977
Who are these people?

267
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:04,480
Aurors. For security reasons.

268
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,148
What’s the stake here, then?

269
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:08,650
It’s not a tree, you cretin. It’s a walking stick.

270
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:12,821
And what exactly would you do
want with a….?

271
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:17,096
It can be understood
as a weapon of war.

272
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,517
All right, Mr. Filch.
I can recommend Mr. Malfoy.

273
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,797
Nice face, Potter.

274
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,763
Do you want me to fix it for you?

275
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:44,621
Personally, I think you look a little more outrageous than this….

276
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,394
….but it’s up to you.

277
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:49,104
Okay, have you trimmed an ear before?

278
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,962
No, but I’ve done a lot of legs, and ​how is it any different, really?

279
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:57,967
Um….Well, yeah. Do it once.

280
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,450
~ Episkey.
~ Ah!

281
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,730
~ How do I present myself?
~ Exceptionally ordinary.

282
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,232
Bright.

283
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,616
Don't worry. He’ll be there in a minute.

284
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:30,184
Will you finish eating?

285
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,687
Your love is lost!

286
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:36,023
Oh. Go back, you fool.

287
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:40,402
He's covered in blood again.

288
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:44,781
~ Why is she always covered in blood?
~ Looks like it belongs to him this time.

289
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,075
Where have you been?

290
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:49,786
~ What happened to your face?
~ Then.

291
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,558
What have I missed?

292
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,833
Sorting Hat has inspired us all to be brave and courageous during this difficult time.

293
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:59,587
Easy to say, right?
It’s a hat, isn’t it?

294
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,179
Good evening to you both.

295
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:10,326
Thank you.

296
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:17,207
First, let me introduce you to the newest member of our staff….

297
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,605
....Horace Slughorn.

298
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,444
Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to say….

299
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:29,823
....ready to start again
his old job as Potions Master.

300
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:32,951
Meanwhile, the message of
Protection from the dark side….

301
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,932
....take Professor Snape.

302
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:36,809
Snape?

303
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:44,420
Now, as you know….

304
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:48,278
….every single one of you was searched when you got here tonight.

305
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:50,467
And you have a right to know why.

306
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:54,846
Once upon a time there was a boy, who, like you….

307
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:57,453
….sitting in this room….

308
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,458
….walking the corridors of this castle, sleeping under its roof.

309
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:07,462
He was seen all over the world
one student as another.

310
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,131
His name?

311
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,946
Tom Riddle.

312
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,827
Now, of course….

313
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:22,685
….the whole world knows it by a different name.

314
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:29,045
So, as I stand and watch you all tonight….

315
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,547
....I remember something sad.

316
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,926
Every day, every hour….

317
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,012
….this minute, maybe….

318
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,495
....dark forces are trying to penetrate the walls of this castle.

319
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:49,689
But in the end,
their biggest weapon is you.

320
00:31:52,713 --> 00:31:54,902
Just something to think about.

321
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:57,717
Now, go to sleep. Beep-beep.

322
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:01,158
That was fun.

323
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:11,167
History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.

324
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:17,006
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That’s the girls’ bathroom.

325
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,177
Potter.

326
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:24,513
Oh, this can’t be good.

327
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,205
We’re happy, aren’t we?

328
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:33,271
~ This morning I had a free month.
~ So I knew.

329
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:36,191
I would think you would want to fill it with potions.

330
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,110
Or do you no longer want to be an Auror?

331
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,489
It was, but I was told I had to get an "Outstanding" on my OWL

332
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:46,513
So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions.

333
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:51,309
However, Professor Slughorn is more than happy to welcome NEWT students….

334
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,290
....with "Beyond Thought."

335
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:55,375
Bright. Um….

336
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:58,086
~ Okay, I'll be there soon.
~ Oh, okay, okay.

337
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:03,091
Potter, take Weasley with you. He seems very happy there.

338
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,219
I don’t want to take potions.

339
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:09,138
This is the next Quidditch tournament. I need to learn.

340
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,266
Pay attention to details
in the preparation….

341
00:33:12,474 --> 00:33:14,768
….it is the prerequisite of all planning.

342
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,688
Ah.

343
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:21,754
Harry, my son, I began to worry. We brought someone with us, I see.

344
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,526
Ron Weasley, sir.

345
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:26,550
But I’m a bit of a jerk in Potions, a quibble, really.

346
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,844
~ I went….
~ It doesn’t matter, we’ll fix it for you.

347
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:32,076
All of Harry’s friends are my friends. Get out your book.

348
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,787
I don’t really have
my book still, and ​Ron too.

349
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,664
Remove whatever you want from the surface.

350
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:40,209
Now, as I said,
I made some drinks this morning.

351
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:44,275
Curious about what this might be?

352
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,341
~ Yes, ma’am….?
~ Granger, sir.

353
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:56,057
That one is Veritaserum. It’s a truth-telling serum.

354
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:58,976
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

355
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,293
It’s very hard to do.

356
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,483
And this Amortentia….

357
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:09,090
....the most powerful
love potion in the world.

358
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:13,781
They say that each person smells differently depending on what attracts them.

359
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,118
For example, I know...

360
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,914
....freshly picked vegetables,
and new paper, and….

361
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:25,459
….mint toothpaste.

362
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,255
Amortentia does not produce
true love. That was impossible.

363
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:35,468
But it does
a great love or hatred.

364
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:42,350
And so, it’s probably the most dangerous drug in this room.

365
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,691
Lord? You haven't told me
which is in that one.

366
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:52,776
Oh, yes.

367
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,487
What you see in front of you,
ladies and gentlemen….

368
00:34:55,695 --> 00:35:01,117
….it’s an essential medicine called Felix Felicis.

369
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,724
But it’s more commonly known as….

370
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:09,250
~ Water luck.
~ Yes, Miss Granger. Water luck.

371
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,690
It’s hard to do, even worse if you don’t get it right.

372
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:18,529
One drink and you’ll find
that everything you do is successful.

373
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,013
At least until the crisis is over.

374
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:27,704
So this is what I give to each of you today.

375
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:32,709
A lucky gem for the student who, in the remaining hour….

376
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:37,505
….it makes for a great living death design….

377
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:40,946
….the recipes you can find on page 10 of your book.

378
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,699
I should mention, however, that only once was a student able to
brew a potion….

379
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:48,244
….which is good enough to qualify for this award.

380
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,059
Anyway, good luck to you all.

381
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:53,770
Let the drinking begin.

382
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,409
How did you do that?

383
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:34,120
You break it down. Don't cut it.

384
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:36,727
No. The word
say to delete it.

385
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:38,812
No, really.

386
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:19,475
Merlin’s head! It’s perfect.

387
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:24,167
I can say it best
one shot would kill us all.

388
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:29,380
So here we are, then, as promised.

389
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:32,821
A vial of Felix Felicis.

390
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,010
Thank you.

391
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:38,242
Use it well.

392
00:38:05,872 --> 00:38:08,583
Harry, you got my point. Enter.

393
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:11,607
How are you?

394
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,275
I'm fine, sir.

395
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:14,735
Are you happy with your class?

396
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:19,010
I met Professor Slughorn
you like it a lot.

397
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,033
I think he really appreciates what I can do, sir.

398
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:23,806
You?

399
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:25,682
Definitely.

400
00:38:27,663 --> 00:38:30,479
What about your business?
outside the classroom?

401
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,711
~ King?
~ Well, I see you’re paying….

402
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:36,526
....a long time with Miss Granger.

403
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,881
I can’t stop thinking about it….

404
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:43,094
No, no. I mean, he’s brilliant, and ​we’re friends, but, no.

405
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,222
Forgive me. I just wanted to know.

406
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,246
But that’s fair enough.

407
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:53,000
You may be wondering
why I called you here tonight.

408
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,440
Here is the answer.

409
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,568
What you see is knowledge.

410
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:03,634
In this case,
what a person, Voldemort….

411
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:06,241
....or, as he was known back then, Tom Riddle.

412
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:13,122
This vial contains
the key idea….

413
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:15,520
….since the day I first met him.

414
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,587
I'd love to see it, if you'd like.

415
00:39:57,226 --> 00:40:01,501
I admit I was a little confused when I received your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

416
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:05,254
In all the years Tom has lived here, he has never had a family visit.

417
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:09,216
There are things going on
with the other children. Bad things.

418
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:13,804
Tom, you have a visitor.

419
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,993
How are you doing, Tom?

420
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,752
No.

421
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:35,699
~ You’re a doctor, aren’t you?
~ Nope.

422
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:37,889
I am a teacher.

423
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,391
I don't believe you.

424
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,581
He wants attention.

425
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,396
They think I'm not.

426
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:47,064
Well, maybe they’re right.

427
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:48,732
I'm not angry.

428
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:52,173
Hogwarts is not a madhouse.

429
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,362
Hogwarts is a school.

430
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,239
A school of magic.

431
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:03,538
You can do things, can’t you, Tom?

432
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:07,291
Which other kids can’t.

433
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:11,670
I can make things move
don't touch them.

434
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:16,154
I can make animals do what I want without teaching them.

435
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:20,533
I can make bad things happen to people who hate me.

436
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:23,139
I might hurt them….

437
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:25,224
....if I want to.

438
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,727
Who are you?

439
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:30,021
Well, I’m not like you, Tom.

440
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:32,731
I am something else.

441
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,130
Show it.

442
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:46,599
I think there’s something in your suit that wants to come out, Tom.

443
00:41:56,295 --> 00:42:00,049
Cheating is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.

444
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:05,887
At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it.

445
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:07,243
Do you understand me?

446
00:42:11,205 --> 00:42:13,811
I can also talk to snakes.

447
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:16,835
They are looking for me.

448
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:19,754
Say things.

449
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:23,091
Is that good enough for someone like me?

450
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:47,488
Did you know, sir? So?

451
00:42:47,593 --> 00:42:53,223
Did I know I just met the scariest wizard of all time? No.

452
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:55,934
If I had, I would...

453
00:42:57,602 --> 00:43:00,104
Back in the day, when I was here at Hogwarts….

454
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:03,545
….Tom Riddle is growing up
with a teacher.

455
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:05,526
Can you imagine
who is the teacher?

456
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:11,990
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back just to teach him Potions, did you?

457
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,180
No, I didn’t.

458
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:18,142
You see, Professor Slughorn has something I am very fond of.

459
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:21,061
And he won't let go anytime soon.

460
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:24,398
You said Professor Slughorn wanted to meet with me.

461
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:25,857
I did it.

462
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:28,568
Do you want me to allow it?

463
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:31,279
Whether.

464
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,192
All right. Um….

465
00:44:57,297 --> 00:45:00,425
This morning, I go
I’ll put you through some lessons….

466
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,718
....just to see how strong you are.

467
00:45:03,448 --> 00:45:05,429
Quiet! Please!

468
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:06,785
Stop it!

469
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:13,353
Thank you. All right. Um….

470
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:15,647
Just because you
made the team last year….

471
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:18,775
....will not get you a seat this year. What does that look like?

472
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:22,529
Good.

473
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:33,476
You don't feel anything, Weasley, okay?

474
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,249
Is it too hard for you?

475
00:45:35,457 --> 00:45:39,002
Yeah, I’m going for Keeper too. It’s not about you.

476
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,817
Really? Stuck person like you?

477
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:44,528
You have more than one Beater's build, don't you think?

478
00:45:44,737 --> 00:45:47,135
Security guards have to be quick, agile.

479
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,263
Oh, I like my chances.

480
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:54,225
Say, do you think you can introduce me to your friend Granger?

481
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:58,604
I don’t mind going
a prefix, you know what I mean?

482
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:12,575
"Come on, Weasley!"

483
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:14,452
~ Come on, Ron!
~ Go, Weasley!

484
00:46:16,016 --> 00:46:18,935
~ Go, Weasley!
~ Yes, Ron!

485
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,291
Go, Cormac!

486
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,954
Come on, Ron!

487
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:48,859
Come on, Ron.

488
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,465
Come on, Ron.

489
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:10,546
Confundus.

490
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:29,000
Isn’t he smart enough?

491
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:35,256
I have to say, I thought
I would miss the last one.

492
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,384
I hope Cormac doesn’t take it too seriously.

493
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:41,825
He's got something for you, Hermione. Cormac.

494
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:44,953
He is evil.

495
00:47:49,853 --> 00:47:52,147
Have you ever heard of this term? Sectumsempra?

496
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:54,336
No, I haven’t.

497
00:47:54,545 --> 00:47:57,673
And if you had a modicum of respect, you would give him the book.

498
00:47:57,881 --> 00:48:00,279
Not too much blood. He’s the best in the class.

499
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:04,658
He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn considers himself a genius.

500
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:07,057
What is?

501
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:10,602
I would like to know who owns the book. Let's see.

502
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,270
No.

503
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:15,085
Why not?

504
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,274
The connection is weak.

505
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:19,985
~ Is the connection weak?
~ Yes.

506
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,824
~ Who is the Half-Blood King?
~ Who?

507
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:29,786
As it says here: "This book belongs to the Half-Blood King."

508
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:50,430
For weeks you drive
this book, almost fell asleep with it….

509
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,933
....but you don't want to know who he is?

510
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:56,478
I didn’t say I wasn’t interested, and ​I didn’t have sex with him.

511
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:57,729
Yes, it's true.

512
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:01,691
I love a good chat before I go to bed. Now you just read the bloody book.

513
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:03,776
It’s like living with Hermione.

514
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:07,634
Well, I wanted to find out, so I went….

515
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:10,345
~ The library.
~ The library. And?

516
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,847
And nothing.

517
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:16,079
I couldn’t find any mention of a Half-Blood Prince.

518
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,373
~ There we go. That settles it, then.
~ Filius!

519
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,875
I was hoping to meet you
on the Three Broomsticks!

520
00:49:20,979 --> 00:49:25,671
No, compulsory choir lessons, I’m afraid, Horace.

521
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,614
Who wants a Butterbeer?

522
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,221
A friend of mine
walking on Claxby Mountain.

523
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:37,974
We had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style trailer….

524
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,581
No, not there. Here.

525
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:42,771
No, sit with me.

526
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:45,794
Good.

527
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:48,609
What drink?

528
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:51,320
Three butter beers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

529
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:05,083
Oh, so much blood.

530
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:09,879
Slick git.

531
00:50:10,192 --> 00:50:12,903
Sincerely, Ronald,
they’re just hanging out.

532
00:50:15,718 --> 00:50:16,969
And music.

533
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:20,618
~ I would like to go.
~ What?

534
00:50:20,723 --> 00:50:22,391
You can’t be perfect.

535
00:50:22,495 --> 00:50:24,893
~ That's my sister.
~ So?

536
00:50:25,102 --> 00:50:28,959
“What if he sees you here and sees you kissing me?” You expect ya
to not perhaps?

537
00:50:30,315 --> 00:50:32,713
~ Hey, son!
~ Good coffee, sir. It’s good to see you.

538
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:34,902
And you, and you.

539
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:36,883
So, what brings you here?

540
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:41,784
The Three Broomsticks and I go way, way back than I care to admit.

541
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:45,329
I can remember
when it was a broom.

542
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:48,874
All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my son, to the days of old….

543
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:52,419
….I used to make the occasional dinner….

544
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,817
….for the chosen teacher or two.

545
00:50:55,025 --> 00:50:58,883
~ Would you be game?
~ I would see an honor, sir.

546
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:02,532
You'd be welcome too, Granger.

547
00:51:03,262 --> 00:51:08,058
~ I would be delighted, sir.
~ Good. Find the dog.

548
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:10,873
Good to see you, Wallenby.

549
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,546
What are you playing?

550
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,613
Dumbledore asked me
to recognize it.

551
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:23,802
~ Will you recognize him?
~ I don't know.

552
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:27,660
It must be important.
If he wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't have asked.

553
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,375
I got a little….

554
00:51:46,323 --> 00:51:48,200
Katie, you have no idea what it could be.

555
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:49,764
~ Harry.
~ What?

556
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:53,517
Did you hear what he said in the pub about me and what he did?

557
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:56,020
That's right.

558
00:52:02,484 --> 00:52:05,820
I promised.
I told him not to touch her.

559
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:30,009
Don't come any closer.
Come back, all of you.

560
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:47,317
Don’t touch that, just with the lid. Do you understand?

561
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:03,374
You know Katie didn’t have this under control….

562
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:06,085
....where else
the three brooms?

563
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:08,274
It's like I said.

564
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:13,383
She went to the bathroom, and when she came back she had the package.

565
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:17,345
He said it was important
that he will give.

566
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:21,724
~ Who said it?
~ By Professor Dumbledore.

567
00:53:22,037 --> 00:53:24,644
Very good. Thank you, Leanne. You can go.

568
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,861
Why is it that when something happens it’s always the three of you?

569
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:40,387
Believe me, teacher, I’ve been asking the same question for six years now.

570
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:42,577
Oh, Severus.

571
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:50,084
What do you think?

572
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:56,861
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

573
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:59,259
He was cursed, wasn’t he?

574
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:02,074
I know Katie. In that environment, it wouldn’t hurt a fly.

575
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:06,141
If he was giving that to Dumbledore, he wasn't doing it knowingly.

576
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:08,226
Yes, it was cursed.

577
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,728
Elijah Malfoy.

578
00:54:12,605 --> 00:54:16,463
That's a terrible mistake, Potter.

579
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,131
Indeed.

580
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:22,406
~ Your tests?
~ I just know.

581
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:25,117
Just….

582
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:27,723
....know.

583
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,728
You amaze me with your gifts, Potter.

584
00:54:32,832 --> 00:54:36,794
Gifts for Men Only
it can only kill its contents.

585
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:43,154
How important it will be
to be the Chosen One.

586
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:51,287
I suggest you go back to bed. All of you.

587
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:04,737
what do you think
Does Dean see in him? Ginny?

588
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,490
Well, what does he see in her?

589
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:10,784
Dean? He’s very smart.

590
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:13,808
You called him a genius
less than five hours ago.

591
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:17,770
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn’t he?

592
00:55:17,978 --> 00:55:22,462
Something breaks, and you have to hate it, you know? In principle.

593
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:24,651
I think so.

594
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:29,134
~ So, what does he see in her?
~ I don't know.

595
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,262
She’s smart, beautiful.

596
00:55:32,992 --> 00:55:35,286
~ Good.
~ Is it so beautiful?

597
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:40,395
~ You know, she has beautiful skin.
~ Skin?

598
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,001
Dean meets my sister
for his skin?

599
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,693
Well, no, I mean, I’m just saying it might be a useful thing.

600
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,802
Hermione has good skin.

601
00:55:53,532 --> 00:55:56,243
Wouldn’t you say? As far as skins go, I mean.

602
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:59,371
I’ve never really thought about it.

603
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:02,603
But, I think, yes.

604
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,793
It’s so beautiful.

605
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:12,612
~ I think I'll go to bed now.
~ Right. Whether.

606
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:26,375
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

607
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:29,086
Yes, sir. In fact,
I need to go fight him….

608
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,484
….and the Minister of Magic during the holidays.

609
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,612
Well, make sure you give them the best.

610
00:56:34,716 --> 00:56:36,697
What about your uncle, Belby?

611
00:56:36,906 --> 00:56:40,347
For those who don’t know, Marcus’ uncle created the Wolfsbane Potion.

612
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:43,370
~ Is he working on something new?
~ I don't know.

613
00:56:43,474 --> 00:56:47,541
He and his father don’t get along. Probably because Dad says potions are garbage.

614
00:56:47,749 --> 00:56:51,086
He says the only potion worth having is a strong one at the end of the day.

615
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:56,299
What are you, Miss Granger? What your family does in
Muggle world?

616
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,905
My parents are dentists.

617
00:57:03,493 --> 00:57:04,744
They take care of people’s teeth.

618
00:57:04,953 --> 00:57:09,645
Excellent. And that’s considered a dangerous job?

619
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:11,104
No.

620
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:17,569
However, a young man, Robbie Fenwick, beat my father once.

621
00:57:17,777 --> 00:57:19,028
He needed 10 stitches.

622
00:57:25,284 --> 00:57:28,933
Ah. Mrs. Weasley. Come in, come in.

623
00:57:31,644 --> 00:57:36,023
Look at his eyes.
They fight again, him and Dean.

624
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:38,943
I'm sorry. I’m not always sad.

625
00:57:42,696 --> 00:57:47,180
Nothing. You only make it in time for breakfast, that is, if Belby left you for a while.

626
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,146
What is?

627
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:57,919
Nothing.

628
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:07,928
Goodbye. Stay.

629
00:58:12,828 --> 00:58:14,497
~ Potter.
~ I'm sorry, sir.

630
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:17,312
I was just looking at your hourglass.

631
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,127
Oh, yes.

632
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:22,733
Something quite amazing.

633
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,634
The sand moves along with the gospel.

634
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:31,179
If excited enough, the sand slips away easily.

635
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,577
~ Otherwise….
~ I think I'll go.

636
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:37,122
It doesn't matter.
You have nothing to fear, my child.

637
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:39,520
Like some of your students….

638
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:43,065
....well, let's just say they won't actually make the shelf.

639
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:44,733
The shelf, sir?

640
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,008
Everyone who wants to be somebody wants to end up here.

641
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:52,970
But then, you're already somebody, aren't you, Harry?

642
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:56,515
Did Voldemort ever build the shelf, sir?

643
00:58:58,704 --> 00:59:02,666
You knew, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

644
00:59:03,709 --> 00:59:07,254
Mr. Riddle had a few students during his time at Hogwarts.

645
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:08,922
What was it like?

646
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:15,074
Excuse me, sir. Forgive me.

647
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:17,576
He killed my parents.

648
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:21,538
Of course.

649
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:24,979
It’s just natural
You should want to know more.

650
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,879
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.

651
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:33,111
When I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a man of silence….

652
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:37,490
....despite his genius, young man is determined to become a master wizard.

653
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,367
Not like anyone else I know.

654
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,078
Not like you, in fact.

655
00:59:43,433 --> 00:59:45,519
If the monster existed….

656
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,334
….it was buried deep.

657
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:07,101
Good luck, eh, Ron.

658
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:10,959
~ Nice hat!
~ Ron, you’re a warrior.

659
01:00:11,168 --> 01:00:14,191
I trust you, Ron.
I have two galleons in Gryffindor, don't I?

660
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,694
~ Looks good, Ron.
~ Fight!

661
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:20,447
What does it entail?

662
01:00:29,101 --> 01:00:30,873
What was it like, then?

663
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,418
~ How was what?
~ Your food?

664
01:00:34,627 --> 01:00:36,295
It’s really sad.

665
01:00:37,025 --> 01:00:39,423
Although I think Harry liked the taste.

666
01:00:42,759 --> 01:00:45,575
Slughorn has a Christmas, you know.

667
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:47,243
And we have to bring somebody.

668
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:51,101
I think you’re going to bring McLaggen. He is a member of the Slug Club,
isn't he?

669
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:54,124
~ Actually, I was going to ask you.
~ Really?

670
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:59,025
Good luck today, Ron.

671
01:00:59,859 --> 01:01:02,153
I know you'll be smart.

672
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:08,930
I stay. After today’s game, McLaggen may have my spot.

673
01:01:09,138 --> 01:01:10,598
Make it your way.

674
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:13,309
~ Juice?
~ Yes.

675
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:15,185
Hello, everyone.

676
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:18,522
You look terrible, Ron.

677
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:21,024
Is that why you put something in his cup?

678
01:01:23,214 --> 01:01:24,882
Is it a tonic?

679
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:29,991
Water luck.

680
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:33,015
Don't drink, Ron.

681
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:43,962
~ You might get fired for it.
~ I don't know what you're talking about.

682
01:01:46,152 --> 01:01:48,863
Come on, Harry.
We have a game to win.

683
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:14,512
Whether!

684
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:17,848
Go ahead, Ron! Do it!

685
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,027
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

686
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:55,904
Whether!

687
01:02:56,008 --> 01:02:59,553
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

688
01:03:03,307 --> 01:03:04,871
Oh!

689
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:08,312
Whether. Oh!

690
01:03:09,771 --> 01:03:14,880
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

691
01:03:19,155 --> 01:03:20,823
You really shouldn't have done it.

692
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:26,036
I know. I think I could just use a Confundus Charm.

693
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,667
That was different. That was thoughtful. This was a real game.

694
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,150
You didn't post it.

695
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:39,695
Ron just thought you did it.

696
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:30,784
Charms spell. I’m just getting used to it.

697
01:04:34,642 --> 01:04:36,519
Well, they’re really good.

698
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,026
How are you feeling, Harry?

699
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,073
Will you ever see Dean with Ginny?

700
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,641
I know.

701
01:04:57,684 --> 01:04:59,874
I see how you see it.

702
01:05:00,603 --> 01:05:02,167
You are my best friend.

703
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:13,115
Oh.

704
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:16,764
I think this house has been taken.

705
01:05:18,537 --> 01:05:19,997
What happens to the birds?

706
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,105
I oppose.

707
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:54,821
This is how I feel.

708
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:37,569
Look, I can’t help
if she’s got her panties in a bunch.

709
01:06:37,673 --> 01:06:42,782
What Lav and I have, well,
let’s just say, no one can stop him.

710
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,346
It’s chemical.

711
01:06:44,554 --> 01:06:48,933
Will it last? Who knows?
The point is, I’m a free agent.

712
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,853
He has complete freedom
to kiss whomever he pleases.

713
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:54,459
I really couldn’t care less.

714
01:06:54,668 --> 01:06:58,526
Did I think he and I were going to Slughorn's Christmas party?

715
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,194
Whether.

716
01:07:00,298 --> 01:07:04,782
Now, because of the circumstances, I have to do different things.

717
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:06,137
Do you have it?

718
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:08,326
Whether. Why?

719
01:07:08,431 --> 01:07:12,080
I just thought, since none of us can go with who we really want….

720
01:07:12,288 --> 01:07:14,478
....we should go together, as friends.

721
01:07:14,687 --> 01:07:16,251
Why didn’t I think of that?

722
01:07:16,459 --> 01:07:18,023
Who are you going with?

723
01:07:18,127 --> 01:07:20,004
Um, it’s a mystery.

724
01:07:20,108 --> 01:07:24,383
However, you are the one we should be worried about. You can't just take someone.

725
01:07:25,009 --> 01:07:26,885
See that girl over there?

726
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:33,141
That’s Romilda Vane. Apparently, he wants to bring you a love potion.

727
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,809
Really?

728
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:39,293
Hey! He only cares about you because he thinks you're Holy.

729
01:07:39,397 --> 01:07:41,170
But I am the Holy One.

730
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:44,193
Well, sorry. Um, I'm kidding.

731
01:07:46,174 --> 01:07:47,634
I'll ask someone I like.

732
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:50,032
Someone interesting.

733
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:02,752
I have never been to this part of the castle.


734
01:08:02,961 --> 01:08:06,193
Nothing when he wakes up.
I’m asleep, you see.

735
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:08,904
That's why I wear sneakers.

736
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:43,102
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

737
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:58,325
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

738
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,599
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

739
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,656
Drink?

740
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,846
Neville.

741
01:09:21,054 --> 01:09:22,514
I didn’t join the Slug Club.

742
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:25,746
It’s okay, though. She has Belby providing towels in the bathroom.

743
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:28,770
~ Oh, well, I’m fine, buddy. Thank you.
~ Good.

744
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:42,115
Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you?

745
01:09:42,324 --> 01:09:47,641
I'm just running away.
I mean, he left Cormac under the doormat.

746
01:09:47,746 --> 01:09:50,769
Cormac? Is that what you called?

747
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,480
I thought it would be very upsetting to Ron.

748
01:09:54,314 --> 01:09:56,295
Thank you. I'll find you later.

749
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:59,527
She has more teeth
than a Snarfalump plant.

750
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:01,821
~ Tartar dragons?
~ No, I’m fine. Thank you.

751
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,636
Just as good.
It gives off a terrible air.

752
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:06,617
On second thought….

753
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,807
He could leave Cormac.

754
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,039
Oh God, here it comes!

755
01:10:14,646 --> 01:10:17,461
I think he just went to clear his nose.

756
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:19,755
Those little floats, your friend.

757
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:22,674
He also likes to work with his mouth, doesn’t he?

758
01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:27,679
What am I going to eat, by the way?

759
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:30,494
Ball dragon.

760
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,778
You just bought yourself a month in prison, McLaggen.

761
01:10:44,986 --> 01:10:48,844
Not so fast, Potter.

762
01:10:50,408 --> 01:10:53,536
Sir, I really think I should join the party again. The day….

763
01:10:53,744 --> 01:10:57,602
You can certainly get away with being gone for a couple of minutes.

764
01:10:57,811 --> 01:11:00,000
Again, I just want
to convey a message.

765
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:02,920
~ A word?
~ From Professor Dumbledore.

766
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,777
He asked me to give you the best, and he wants you to be happy.

767
01:11:06,882 --> 01:11:08,446
See….

768
01:11:08,654 --> 01:11:14,180
....he leaves, and he won't be back until class starts again.

769
01:11:14,389 --> 01:11:15,848
Where are you going?

770
01:11:23,981 --> 01:11:25,858
Get your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

771
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:28,777
Professor Slughorn, my lord.

772
01:11:28,881 --> 01:11:33,260
I just found this guy
hidden in an upstairs hallway.

773
01:11:33,365 --> 01:11:35,450
He says it was
invite to your party.

774
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,891
Okay, okay. I was fighting. Happy?

775
01:11:39,516 --> 01:11:43,270
I'll take it out.

776
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:49,734
Yes, Master.

777
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:56,615
All right, everyone, follow along, follow along.

778
01:11:58,701 --> 01:12:03,601
Maybe I hexed Miss Bell. Maybe I didn’t. What works for you?

779
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,895
I promised to protect you.

780
01:12:06,103 --> 01:12:09,440
I made that unbreakable commitment.

781
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:11,734
I don't need to be saved.

782
01:12:11,942 --> 01:12:16,113
I was chosen for this.
About everyone else. Me.

783
01:12:17,051 --> 01:12:20,492
~ And I won't give up.
~ You're scared, Draco.

784
01:12:21,117 --> 01:12:25,079
You want to hide,
but it seems. Let me help you.

785
01:12:25,184 --> 01:12:26,643
No!

786
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,397
I was chosen. This is my day.

787
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:44,472
"Irrevocable vote."

788
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:46,245
You know that's what Snape said?

789
01:12:46,453 --> 01:12:48,643
Whether. Why?

790
01:12:48,852 --> 01:12:52,397
Well, you just can’t break an unbreakable contract.

791
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,837
I worked a lot on my own, which is fun.

792
01:12:56,359 --> 01:12:58,131
You don't understand.

793
01:12:58,757 --> 01:12:59,799
Oh, so much blood.

794
01:13:27,638 --> 01:13:29,514
Miss.

795
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:32,851
Cute.

796
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:36,292
He just wants to fuck me. My mouth is open. Look.

797
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,690
I'll take your word for it.

798
01:13:48,803 --> 01:13:53,704
So, what happens to you? What happens if you break an irrevocable contract?

799
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:55,997
You will die.

800
01:14:00,585 --> 01:14:02,462
Wait, the pudding is still here.

801
01:14:03,713 --> 01:14:07,049
Voldemort chooses
Draco Malfoy for a job?

802
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:08,300
I know it sounds ridiculous.

803
01:14:08,405 --> 01:14:11,950
Did you think Snape was just pretending to help Draco...

804
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:14,556
....that he could find out
What was he doing?

805
01:14:14,765 --> 01:14:17,788
~ That’s not what it sounded like.
~ Maybe Harry is telling the truth.

806
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,978
To make an irrevocable commitment is….

807
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:23,627
It comes down to whether or not you believe Dumbledore's words.

808
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:27,902
~ Dumbledore trusts Snape, so I do.
~ Dumbledore can make mistakes.

809
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,153
You are blinded by anger.

810
01:14:29,362 --> 01:14:31,447
~ Not this.
~ Yes, you.

811
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:36,139
People are disappearing, Harry, every day.

812
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,328
We hope
in a couple of people.

813
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:41,456
If we start fighting each other, we will be killed.

814
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,418
Open it, you.

815
01:15:09,086 --> 01:15:10,754
Don't you believe me?

816
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:18,053
Good.

817
01:15:18,991 --> 01:15:21,806
Yeah, I'll just.... get it.... Yeah.

818
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:31,399
~ Cake?
~ Not for me, no.

819
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:44,849
You have to forgive Remus.

820
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:47,976
He takes his revenge, his life.

821
01:15:48,915 --> 01:15:50,896
Hello, Mr. Weasley?

822
01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:53,607
They're after us, all of us.

823
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,318
Most of the time,
Molly doesn’t leave the house.

824
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:59,237
It was nothing.

825
01:16:01,218 --> 01:16:02,573
Did you get my dog?

826
01:16:02,782 --> 01:16:04,867
Yes, I did.

827
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:09,455
If Dumbledore leaves,
then the Ministry’s statement….

828
01:16:09,559 --> 01:16:12,061
....but maybe that's how Dumbledore wants it.

829
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:15,294
Like Draco Malfoy….

830
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:17,066
....I know a little more.

831
01:16:17,692 --> 01:16:20,715
~ Go to sleep.
~ I sent a servant to Borgin and Burkes.

832
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:23,218
I think, what you said...

833
01:16:23,426 --> 01:16:25,094
….which you and Ron saw during the day….

834
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,744
….the thing
which Draco craves….

835
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:30,412
....it's a missing cabinet.

836
01:16:31,246 --> 01:16:32,601
A missing cabinet?

837
01:16:32,706 --> 01:16:36,772
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first came to power.

838
01:16:36,876 --> 01:16:39,900
You can see the question.
Should the Death Eaters come to play….

839
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:44,800
….one just had to go in and disappear for an hour or two.

840
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:47,198
They can take you anywhere.

841
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:50,743
Things are very difficult, very deep.

842
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:53,767
What happened to him?
The one about Borgin and Burkes?

843
01:16:53,975 --> 01:16:55,122
Nothing.

844
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:57,625
It's still there.

845
01:17:08,781 --> 01:17:10,449
It was sweet, Molly, actually.

846
01:17:10,658 --> 01:17:11,909
Are you sure you won't stay?

847
01:17:12,117 --> 01:17:16,496
No, we have to go. The first night of the cycle is always the worst.

848
01:17:16,705 --> 01:17:17,643
Remus?

849
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,174
Sweetheart.

850
01:17:36,515 --> 01:17:38,183
Is Ron asleep?

851
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:41,207
Um.... I agree. No.

852
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:44,335
Shoelace.

853
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:58,827
Merry Christmas, Harry.

854
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:01,747
Merry christmas.

855
01:18:19,055 --> 01:18:21,348
~ Harry, no!
~ Remus!

856
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:32,609
Ginny!

857
01:18:35,737 --> 01:18:40,429
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!

858
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:42,827
“Will you come and get me?”

859
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:47,310
Harry, can you pick me up?
“Will you come and get me?”

860
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:18,381
Harry?

861
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,565
Get lost!

862
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:02,171
Harry!

863
01:20:15,726 --> 01:20:16,872
Ginny!

864
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:47,943
Molly.

865
01:21:10,985 --> 01:21:12,653
It's easy for them to find you.

866
01:21:12,862 --> 01:21:16,928
You’re so lucky they didn’t kill you. You need to know who you are, Harry.

867
01:21:17,137 --> 01:21:19,639
I know who I am, Hermione, okay?

868
01:21:20,682 --> 01:21:21,829
I'm sorry.

869
01:21:23,497 --> 01:21:26,833
Lav, come on. Yes, I’ll add it.

870
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:29,127
That’s my Won-Won.

871
01:21:31,212 --> 01:21:33,610
Excuse me, I have to go and get lost.

872
01:21:51,231 --> 01:21:53,525
I would like to know
where you will receive your mail.

873
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:56,757
More information
that half of the tree, you.

874
01:22:02,387 --> 01:22:03,951
Lord....

875
01:22:04,368 --> 01:22:07,183
....straight
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

876
01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:10,207
Oh, Tom.
I couldn’t tell you if I knew, could I?

877
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:14,586
Also, thanks for the pineapple. You’re right, it’s my favorite.

878
01:22:15,212 --> 01:22:17,505
But how did you know?

879
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:20,842
Intuition.

880
01:22:25,117 --> 01:22:26,785
Good. Is the time ready?

881
01:22:26,993 --> 01:22:30,643
Go away, boys, or Master Dippet will lock us all up in jail.

882
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:38,567
Take care, Tom. Don’t want to be dragged out of bed after hours.

883
01:22:40,548 --> 01:22:42,529
~ What the hell are you thinking, Tom?
~ Yes, sir.

884
01:22:43,884 --> 01:22:46,699
You see, I couldn’t imagine
that someone else is going to.

885
01:22:47,638 --> 01:22:52,642
The other students,
yes, they are not like you.

886
01:22:53,059 --> 01:22:56,083
They may misunderstand.

887
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:57,856
Go away.

888
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,879
I was in the library last night….

889
01:23:01,505 --> 01:23:03,694
….in the Restricted Section….

890
01:23:04,424 --> 01:23:07,969
….and I read something weird about a bit of temporary magic.

891
01:23:08,907 --> 01:23:12,348
And I thought maybe
you could enlighten me.

892
01:23:12,557 --> 01:23:15,372
It’s called, as I understand it….

893
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,438
I apologize to you?

894
01:23:19,647 --> 01:23:23,192
I don't know anything about it, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

895
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:28,196
Now, get out of here quickly, and ​don't let me catch you saying it!

896
01:23:31,116 --> 01:23:32,263
Confused?

897
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,452
I’d be surprised if you weren’t.

898
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,101
Yeah, I don't understand.
What happened?

899
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,959
This is probably the most important piece of knowledge I’ve ever collected.

900
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:44,044
It's also a lie.

901
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,755
This knowledge has been destroyed….

902
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:51,343
….with the same person in mind, our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

903
01:23:51,968 --> 01:23:53,949
But why would he violate
with his mind?

904
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:56,973
~ I think he's ashamed of it.
~ Why?

905
01:23:57,182 --> 01:23:58,641
Why, exactly?

906
01:23:59,475 --> 01:24:02,812
I asked you to meet
Professor Slughorn, and ​you did.

907
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,565
Now I want you to convince him to tell you his true memories….

908
01:24:06,774 --> 01:24:08,338
....as much as possible.

909
01:24:08,546 --> 01:24:10,423
I don’t know very well, sir.

910
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:17,826
This mindset is everything.

911
01:24:18,347 --> 01:24:20,328
If we don't have it, we're blind.

912
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:24,499
Otherwise, we leave the fate of our world to chance.

913
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,356
You have no choice.

914
01:24:29,608 --> 01:24:31,589
You don't have to be confused.

915
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:42,015
So I would strongly recommend
get to know yourself...

916
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,579
….with the chapter on antidotes.

917
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:47,541
I’ll tell you more about bezoars in a later article. Yes, go ahead.

918
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:50,147
Alys, don’t forget your hair.

919
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:59,427
Aha. Otherwise
the Potions Lord himself.

920
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:01,512
What am I paying for this happiness?

921
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:04,744
Sir, I thought
if I could ask you something.

922
01:25:04,953 --> 01:25:07,247
Ask away, my dear, ask away.

923
01:25:07,351 --> 01:25:10,375
One day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section….

924
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:14,232
….and I discovered something strange about something unusual
of magic.

925
01:25:15,588 --> 01:25:18,194
Whether. And what was this
something unusual?

926
01:25:18,403 --> 01:25:21,739
Well, I don’t know.
I can’t remember the name.

927
01:25:21,948 --> 01:25:26,223
It got me thinking, is there anything you can’t teach?

928
01:25:28,204 --> 01:25:29,559
I'm the potions master, Harry.

929
01:25:29,768 --> 01:25:32,583
I think your question
we'd better get in front of Professor Snape.

930
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:34,668
Whether. Um….

931
01:25:34,877 --> 01:25:37,275
He and I aren’t really
see eye to eye, sir.

932
01:25:37,483 --> 01:25:39,256
What I mean is….

933
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:41,862
....well, he's not like you.

934
01:25:42,592 --> 01:25:44,365
He may misunderstand.

935
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,578
Whether. There can be no light
it’s not dark at all.

936
01:25:49,682 --> 01:25:53,748
And so it is with magic. Personally, I always try to be in the spotlight.

937
01:25:54,374 --> 01:25:56,042
I urge you to do the same.

938
01:25:56,459 --> 01:25:59,379
Is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking for you?

939
01:26:06,364 --> 01:26:09,388
Dumbledore put you in this situation, didn't he?

940
01:26:11,473 --> 01:26:13,037
Isn't he?

941
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,691
Whether?

942
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:24,193
Oh, yes, Potter.

943
01:26:24,402 --> 01:26:26,800
Excuse me, I'm working right now.

944
01:26:39,624 --> 01:26:43,378
It's pretty cool, isn't it? The moon.

945
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,776
Exciting.

946
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:48,800
We had a little
late night snack, right?

947
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:53,491
It was on your bed, the box. I just decided to try one.

948
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,141
~ O 20.
~ I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

949
01:26:57,349 --> 01:26:59,330
Honestly, I thought
he was teasing you.

950
01:26:59,539 --> 01:27:01,832
He could never get mad at me.

951
01:27:03,605 --> 01:27:05,169
I think I’m in love.

952
01:27:08,714 --> 01:27:11,008
Well, very good.

953
01:27:14,865 --> 01:27:16,534
Do you think he knows I exist?

954
01:27:16,638 --> 01:27:19,140
I hope so. He's been bothering you for three months now.

955
01:27:19,349 --> 01:27:22,268
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

956
01:27:23,207 --> 01:27:24,458
Who are you talking about?

957
01:27:25,188 --> 01:27:28,837
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

958
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:30,505
Yes, it’s amazing.

959
01:27:33,633 --> 01:27:37,282
~ What was that?
~ Not for nothing! I’m in love with it!

960
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:40,306
Well, you’re in love with him. When do you really know?

961
01:27:41,348 --> 01:27:44,268
No. Can you recognize me?

962
01:28:05,955 --> 01:28:10,751
Come on, Ron. Let me introduce you to Romilda Vane.

963
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:25,139
Excuse me, sir. I wouldn't bother you unless I really had to.

964
01:28:26,077 --> 01:28:27,433
Where is Romilda?

965
01:28:27,641 --> 01:28:29,518
What about Wenby?

966
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,916
Very strong love.

967
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,419
Very good. You better bring it.

968
01:28:34,627 --> 01:28:37,859
I would think you could find a cure for this in no time, Harry.

969
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:40,987
Well, I thought this needed a more experienced hand, sir.

970
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:44,219
Hello, my dear. Do you want a drink?

971
01:28:44,428 --> 01:28:46,096
Maybe you're right.

972
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:56,001
I apologize, by the way, sir, for the first time today, for any misunderstanding.

973
01:28:56,210 --> 01:29:00,589
Nothing. All water
under the bridge, you know? Straight?

974
01:29:00,693 --> 01:29:03,612
I guess you’re tired of it after all these years.

975
01:29:03,821 --> 01:29:06,428
All questions about Voldemort.

976
01:29:06,532 --> 01:29:08,409
Don't use that name.

977
01:29:16,124 --> 01:29:18,209
There you are, young man. Bottom up.

978
01:29:18,418 --> 01:29:21,441
~ What is this?
~ Tonic for the nerves.

979
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:38,332
~ What happened to me?
~ Love Potion.

980
01:29:38,436 --> 01:29:40,626
A very strong one at that.

981
01:29:41,147 --> 01:29:44,797
~ I feel really bad.
~ You need a ride.

982
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:48,654
I got Butterbeer,
wine, sparkling oak.

983
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:53,138
I had other things I wanted to do, but I guess, given the circumstances….

984
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,100
Here we go, Potter.

985
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:58,768
In life!

986
01:30:03,668 --> 01:30:04,607
Ron.

987
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:10,550
Ron. Teacher, please do something.

988
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,261
I don't understand.

989
01:30:29,734 --> 01:30:31,507
Come on, Ron, calm down.

990
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:56,530
These girls, they’re going to kill me.

991
01:31:07,582 --> 01:31:10,918
Imagine for a moment yourself, Harry, with a bezoar.

992
01:31:11,127 --> 01:31:13,421
You must be very proud
from your teacher, Horace.

993
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:17,070
Hm? Oh, yes, I am so proud.

994
01:31:17,278 --> 01:31:19,989
I think the same,
What Potter did was brilliant.

995
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:24,160
The question is,
why was it necessary?

996
01:31:24,368 --> 01:31:26,037
Why, exactly?

997
01:31:26,245 --> 01:31:28,226
This feels like a gift, Horace.

998
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:31,354
You don’t remember
who gave you this skin?

999
01:31:31,563 --> 01:31:35,525
Which, by the way, has a very subtle hint of liquorice and cherry….

1000
01:31:35,733 --> 01:31:38,131
....when he's not drinking poison.

1001
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:41,468
I really wanted
to give as a gift to myself.

1002
01:31:41,676 --> 01:31:43,032
By whom, may I ask?

1003
01:31:44,804 --> 01:31:46,994
To you, Master.

1004
01:31:49,392 --> 01:31:50,434
Where is he?

1005
01:31:50,643 --> 01:31:54,709
Where is my Won-Won?
Has he asked me?

1006
01:31:57,733 --> 01:31:59,401
What is he doing here?

1007
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:01,799
I can ask you the same question.

1008
01:32:02,008 --> 01:32:04,301
I’m his friend.

1009
01:32:04,406 --> 01:32:07,221
I’m his friend.

1010
01:32:07,325 --> 01:32:11,600
It doesn’t make me laugh.
You haven’t spoken in weeks.

1011
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:15,249
I think you want to get ready now because he’s all important.

1012
01:32:15,458 --> 01:32:19,107
He was raped, you idiot!

1013
01:32:19,315 --> 01:32:22,130
And for the record,
I’ve always found it very useful.

1014
01:32:23,799 --> 01:32:28,803
Ah. See? He feels my body.

1015
01:32:29,012 --> 01:32:32,244
Don’t worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1016
01:32:32,974 --> 01:32:34,746
I'm here.

1017
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:43,817
Uh….Hermione….

1018
01:32:47,884 --> 01:32:49,865
Hermione.

1019
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,888
Hermione.

1020
01:33:00,499 --> 01:33:04,357
Oh, to be young,
and you will feel the intensity of love.

1021
01:33:04,774 --> 01:33:07,068
Well, come on, everyone.

1022
01:33:07,277 --> 01:33:09,883
Mr. Weasley is well taken care of.

1023
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:16,660
Don’t you think about that time?

1024
01:33:19,371 --> 01:33:20,935
Thank you.

1025
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:25,627
Oh, shut up.

1026
01:35:37,938 --> 01:35:41,795
Stop, Ron. You make it snow.

1027
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:48,885
Let me know how I broke
with Lavender again.

1028
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:52,534
Um, well….

1029
01:35:52,743 --> 01:35:55,767
….she came to see you
in the hospital.

1030
01:35:56,601 --> 01:35:58,999
And you spoke.

1031
01:36:00,667 --> 01:36:04,733
I don’t believe it was
a very long sentence.

1032
01:36:04,838 --> 01:36:08,174
Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad I got killed.

1033
01:36:08,383 --> 01:36:10,676
Only he looks a little disappointed.

1034
01:36:17,141 --> 01:36:20,686
Yes, he does, doesn’t he?

1035
01:36:22,354 --> 01:36:27,358
You say you don’t remember
what about that night?

1036
01:36:27,567 --> 01:36:30,486
What kind?

1037
01:36:30,695 --> 01:36:32,467
There is something.

1038
01:36:36,012 --> 01:36:40,496
But it can't be.
I was quite surprised, wasn’t I?

1039
01:36:41,955 --> 01:36:45,188
Right. Surprised.

1040
01:36:52,486 --> 01:36:53,737
Harry.

1041
01:36:55,197 --> 01:36:56,344
That’s Katie.

1042
01:36:58,325 --> 01:36:59,889
Katie Bell.

1043
01:37:07,604 --> 01:37:10,002
Katie. How are you?

1044
01:37:10,628 --> 01:37:15,111
I know you'll ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me.

1045
01:37:16,779 --> 01:37:20,324
I wanted to remember, of course.

1046
01:37:20,741 --> 01:37:24,182
But I can’t.

1047
01:37:37,424 --> 01:37:38,779
Katie?

1048
01:38:21,214 --> 01:38:25,281
I know what you did, Malfoy. You kissed him, didn’t you?

1049
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:57,602
Sectumsempra!

1050
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:47,545
Vulnera Sanentur.

1051
01:39:49,213 --> 01:39:52,028
Vulnera Sanentur.

1052
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:57,241
Vulnera Sanentur.

1053
01:40:18,302 --> 01:40:21,847
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1054
01:40:26,748 --> 01:40:28,312
Take my hand.

1055
01:40:44,368 --> 01:40:46,245
The house you need.

1056
01:40:52,709 --> 01:40:55,316
We need to hide
the book of the Half-Blood Prince….

1057
01:40:55,525 --> 01:40:59,174
....where no one can find it, not even you.

1058
01:41:07,619 --> 01:41:08,975
~ What was that?
~ What was that?

1059
01:41:35,145 --> 01:41:36,500
See?

1060
01:41:37,022 --> 01:41:39,003
You never know what you’ll find up here.

1061
01:41:58,187 --> 01:42:02,149
Okay, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted.

1062
01:42:06,007 --> 01:42:07,675
Close your eyes.

1063
01:42:34,367 --> 01:42:37,182
It can also stay hidden here, if you want.

1064
01:42:51,883 --> 01:42:54,281
So, you and Ginny did?

1065
01:42:54,385 --> 01:42:55,532
What is?

1066
01:42:55,741 --> 01:42:57,826
You know, burning the book?

1067
01:42:58,034 --> 01:42:59,911
Oh, yes.

1068
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:05,333
Ah. My brother, yes.

1069
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:08,356
Still no luck with Slughorn, so, I agree?

1070
01:43:10,442 --> 01:43:11,693
Period.

1071
01:43:12,736 --> 01:43:16,072
That's it. All you need is a little luck.

1072
01:43:34,214 --> 01:43:37,446
Well, how are you feeling?

1073
01:43:37,655 --> 01:43:39,219
Excellent.

1074
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:42,451
It’s really cool.

1075
01:43:45,162 --> 01:43:46,726
Think....

1076
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:48,811
….Slughorn always eats breakfast….

1077
01:43:49,019 --> 01:43:52,043
....tour,
and then returns to work.

1078
01:43:52,147 --> 01:43:53,711
Right.

1079
01:43:54,128 --> 01:43:56,214
~ I go down to Hagrid.
~ What?

1080
01:43:56,422 --> 01:43:59,133
No, Harry, you need to go and talk to Slughorn.

1081
01:44:00,697 --> 01:44:03,303
~ We have an idea.
~ I know….

1082
01:44:03,408 --> 01:44:05,493
....but I have a
I feel good about Hagrid.

1083
01:44:05,701 --> 01:44:09,455
I know it’s the place I need to be tonight. You know what I mean?

1084
01:44:10,289 --> 01:44:12,583
~ Nope.
~ Well, trust me, I know what I’m doing.

1085
01:44:12,791 --> 01:44:14,877
Or Felix does.

1086
01:44:16,024 --> 01:44:17,483
Hello!

1087
01:44:48,137 --> 01:44:49,805
Merlin's Hair, Harry!

1088
01:44:50,014 --> 01:44:54,184
Excuse me, sir. I had to confess. I cleared my throat, smiling.

1089
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:56,269
Maybe you were afraid
I was Professor Sprout.

1090
01:44:56,478 --> 01:44:59,814
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1091
01:45:00,023 --> 01:45:02,108
Well, just the general sense, sir.

1092
01:45:02,317 --> 01:45:05,028
The theft,
the rush when they saw us.

1093
01:45:05,236 --> 01:45:08,781
The Tentacle Leaf, sir? They’re special, aren’t they?

1094
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:11,283
Ten Galleons a flower for the right customer.

1095
01:45:11,492 --> 01:45:15,037
Not that I know anything about it, but one hears voices.

1096
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:18,999
My preference
just students, of course.

1097
01:45:19,103 --> 01:45:22,440
Me, this year
it always scared me.

1098
01:45:25,672 --> 01:45:27,861
How do you get out of the house, Harry?

1099
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:29,529
At the front door, sir.

1100
01:45:29,738 --> 01:45:31,823
I'm going to Hagrid's house.
He’s a good friend….

1101
01:45:32,032 --> 01:45:33,700
….and I wanted to pay him a visit.

1102
01:45:33,909 --> 01:45:36,202
So if you don’t mind,
I’m leaving now.

1103
01:45:37,036 --> 01:45:38,600
Harry!

1104
01:45:39,435 --> 01:45:41,937
~ King?
~ It's getting late.

1105
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:45,482
Surely you know I cannot let you roam the country alone.

1106
01:45:45,690 --> 01:45:48,297
Well, then, with all your heart, welcome, sir.

1107
01:45:53,614 --> 01:45:56,847
Harry, I must say
you took me….

1108
01:45:57,055 --> 01:45:58,723
....get back to the castle immediately!

1109
01:45:58,932 --> 01:46:02,164
That would be wrong, sir.

1110
01:46:03,519 --> 01:46:05,605
And what makes you say that?

1111
01:46:06,752 --> 01:46:08,316
I don’t know.

1112
01:46:15,093 --> 01:46:16,448
Horace.

1113
01:46:17,074 --> 01:46:22,391
Merlin's head.
Is that a real Acromantula?

1114
01:46:23,017 --> 01:46:25,102
A dead one, I think, sir.

1115
01:46:25,832 --> 01:46:27,396
God is good.

1116
01:46:28,021 --> 01:46:31,149
My friend,
How did you manage to kill him?

1117
01:46:31,462 --> 01:46:34,903
Will you kill? My oldest friend, he was.

1118
01:46:35,007 --> 01:46:39,282
~ I’m really sorry, I didn’t….
~ Don’t worry, you’re not alone.

1119
01:46:39,803 --> 01:46:43,244
Misunderstood animals, spiders.

1120
01:46:43,348 --> 01:46:45,538
It’s the eyes, I think.
It bothers some people.

1121
01:46:46,059 --> 01:46:47,936
Not to mention the tweezers.

1122
01:46:52,315 --> 01:46:54,192
Yes, I think so too.

1123
01:46:54,921 --> 01:46:58,258
Hagrid, The Last Thing
I wish I could be the opposite….

1124
01:46:58,466 --> 01:47:02,533
....but Acromantular venom
it doesn’t last long.

1125
01:47:02,741 --> 01:47:04,931
Would you let me
to pull out a flask or two?

1126
01:47:05,139 --> 01:47:07,746
Just for educational reasons, you understand.

1127
01:47:07,954 --> 01:47:10,769
Well, I don’t think it will help much now, does it?

1128
01:47:10,978 --> 01:47:12,229
My guess is true.

1129
01:47:12,333 --> 01:47:18,902
Always keep one or two body bulbs on hand just for occasions like this.

1130
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:24,115
Classic Potions Master, you know.

1131
01:47:24,845 --> 01:47:27,243
I wish you could have seen it when it was better.

1132
01:47:27,452 --> 01:47:31,101
It was amazing, it was. Just beautiful.

1133
01:47:32,561 --> 01:47:34,125
Oh dear.

1134
01:47:43,821 --> 01:47:47,053
~ Do you want me to say a few words?
~ Yes.

1135
01:47:47,262 --> 01:47:48,826
He had a family, I believe?

1136
01:47:49,034 --> 01:47:50,494
Oh, yes.

1137
01:47:55,811 --> 01:47:57,271
Farewell....

1138
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,356
Aragog.

1139
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,759
Farewell, Aragog….

1140
01:48:07,176 --> 01:48:09,887
....king of the arachnids.

1141
01:48:10,721 --> 01:48:13,223
Your body will rot….

1142
01:48:14,475 --> 01:48:17,290
….but your spirit remains.

1143
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:24,692
And your human friends are comforted by their suffering.

1144
01:48:39,915 --> 01:48:43,460
I got it from a restaurant, you know. A little girl was when she was born.

1145
01:48:43,668 --> 01:48:47,318
No bigger than a Pekingese.
A Pekingese, mind you.

1146
01:48:47,526 --> 01:48:52,739
Which is sweet. I once had a fish. Francisco. He really loved me.

1147
01:48:52,844 --> 01:48:58,057
One night I went downstairs, and he was gone.

1148
01:48:58,265 --> 01:48:59,829
Poof.

1149
01:48:59,934 --> 01:49:03,166
~ That’s pretty weird, isn’t it?
~ That’s it, isn’t it?

1150
01:49:03,374 --> 01:49:07,023
But that’s life, I guess.

1151
01:49:07,232 --> 01:49:12,549
You go and then all of a sudden, poof!

1152
01:49:12,758 --> 01:49:16,407
~ Poof.
~ Poof.

1153
01:49:31,004 --> 01:49:34,028
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1154
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:39,345
A spring afternoon
I found a cup on my desk….

1155
01:49:40,284 --> 01:49:43,203
....just by a few inches
of pure water in it.

1156
01:49:44,037 --> 01:49:47,582
And floating in the water was a flower.

1157
01:49:49,146 --> 01:49:51,544
When I looked at it, it was going down.

1158
01:49:53,108 --> 01:49:55,923
Just before it reached the bottom….

1159
01:49:56,132 --> 01:49:57,591
….changed….

1160
01:49:58,947 --> 01:50:00,719
....in a small fish.

1161
01:50:02,492 --> 01:50:04,577
It was pure magic.

1162
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:07,809
It’s pretty cool to see.

1163
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:13,231
The flower came from a lily.

1164
01:50:15,629 --> 01:50:16,567
Monana.

1165
01:50:18,653 --> 01:50:21,155
The moment I landed….

1166
01:50:22,093 --> 01:50:24,387
….the days when the cup was empty….

1167
01:50:25,951 --> 01:50:28,141
….it was your mother’s day….

1168
01:50:32,103 --> 01:50:34,084
I know why you're here.

1169
01:50:37,107 --> 01:50:39,088
But I can't help you.

1170
01:50:40,965 --> 01:50:42,633
It would tear me apart.

1171
01:50:46,387 --> 01:50:48,785
Do you know why I survived, Master?

1172
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:51,183
The night I got this?

1173
01:50:52,955 --> 01:50:54,519
Because yes.

1174
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:57,230
Because he sacrificed himself.

1175
01:50:57,751 --> 01:51:00,045
Because he didn’t want to stay.

1176
01:51:00,254 --> 01:51:03,486
Because his love was stronger than Voldemort's.

1177
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:07,344
~ Don’t say his name.
~ I'm not afraid of that name, Master.

1178
01:51:08,178 --> 01:51:10,263
I'll tell you something.

1179
01:51:11,201 --> 01:51:14,121
Something that others were just scratching the surface of.

1180
01:51:16,102 --> 01:51:17,666
It's true.

1181
01:51:18,187 --> 01:51:19,543
I am the Chosen One.

1182
01:51:20,481 --> 01:51:22,670
Only I can destroy it;
but to be able to do it….

1183
01:51:22,879 --> 01:51:26,215
….I’m curious what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office….

1184
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,718
....and I need to know what you told him.

1185
01:51:29,448 --> 01:51:31,846
Take heart, teacher.

1186
01:51:33,514 --> 01:51:35,599
Be brave like my mother.

1187
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:39,561
Otherwise, you're embarrassing.

1188
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:42,898
Otherwise, he died in vain.

1189
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:49,153
Otherwise, the bowl
it will remain empty forever.

1190
01:51:59,684 --> 01:52:02,812
Please, don't think badly of me when you see me.

1191
01:52:04,897 --> 01:52:08,129
You don’t know what it was like, even back then.

1192
01:52:44,934 --> 01:52:47,541
I was in the library last night….

1193
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:49,939
….in the Restricted Section….

1194
01:52:50,773 --> 01:52:54,422
….and I read something weird about a bit of temporary magic.

1195
01:52:55,778 --> 01:52:58,489
It’s called, as I understand it….

1196
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:01,095
….a Horcrux.

1197
01:53:02,972 --> 01:53:05,683
~ I beg your pardon?
~ Horcrux.

1198
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:08,811
I found the quote while reading….

1199
01:53:08,915 --> 01:53:11,939
….and I didn’t get it all.

1200
01:53:12,147 --> 01:53:13,816
I don’t know what you
were reading, Tom….

1201
01:53:14,024 --> 01:53:16,631
....but this is very dark, very dark indeed.

1202
01:53:16,839 --> 01:53:18,299
Which is….

1203
01:53:19,446 --> 01:53:21,322
....why I came to you.

1204
01:53:24,138 --> 01:53:29,768
A Horcrux is a situation where a person has hidden part of their soul.

1205
01:53:29,976 --> 01:53:32,583
But I don't understand
how does that work, sir.

1206
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:39,152
One splits one’s soul and folds a piece into something.

1207
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,905
That way, you will be protected, if you are attacked and your body is mutilated.

1208
01:53:43,114 --> 01:53:44,260
Is it protected?

1209
01:53:44,365 --> 01:53:47,597
The part of your soul
hidden still lives.

1210
01:53:49,057 --> 01:53:51,455
In other words, you cannot die.

1211
01:53:58,649 --> 01:54:01,777
And how does one divide one’s soul, sir?

1212
01:54:01,985 --> 01:54:04,800
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1213
01:54:06,052 --> 01:54:07,511
Murder.

1214
01:54:08,033 --> 01:54:09,284
Whether.

1215
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:14,810
Murder crushes the soul. It is a violation of nature.

1216
01:54:15,644 --> 01:54:20,440
Can you split the soul at once? Like, not seven….?

1217
01:54:20,649 --> 01:54:22,108
Seven?

1218
01:54:22,838 --> 01:54:28,155
Merlin's Head, Tom. Isn't it horrible to think about killing someone?

1219
01:54:28,364 --> 01:54:32,013
To cut the soul into seven pieces….

1220
01:54:33,264 --> 01:54:36,288
This is all nonsense, isn’t it, Tom? All academics?

1221
01:54:41,084 --> 01:54:42,335
Yes, sir.

1222
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:47,340
It will be our little secret gem.

1223
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,349
Lord.

1224
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,866
This is more important than I thought.

1225
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:17,785
You mean he succeeded, sir, in creating a Horcrux?

1226
01:55:17,889 --> 01:55:21,017
Oh, yeah, he won, all right. And not just once.

1227
01:55:21,226 --> 01:55:22,268
What exactly are they?

1228
01:55:22,373 --> 01:55:25,709
It could be anything.
Deeper things.

1229
01:55:28,941 --> 01:55:30,609
A ring, for example.

1230
01:55:31,235 --> 01:55:32,695
Or a book.

1231
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:36,448
~ Tom Riddle's diary.
~ It's a Horcrux, yes.

1232
01:55:36,969 --> 01:55:39,055
Four years ago, when you saved Ginny’s life….

1233
01:55:39,263 --> 01:55:41,453
....in the secret room, you brought me this.

1234
01:55:41,661 --> 01:55:43,538
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1235
01:55:43,747 --> 01:55:48,751
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I didn’t know how strong.

1236
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,941
~ The ring?
~ Voldemort's mother.

1237
01:55:51,358 --> 01:55:56,050
It’s hard to find.
It’s still hard to play.

1238
01:55:56,258 --> 01:56:00,116
But if you could find them all, if you destroyed every Horcrux….

1239
01:56:00,325 --> 01:56:01,471
One destroys Voldemort.

1240
01:56:01,576 --> 01:56:04,495
But how do you find them? They could be stored anywhere.

1241
01:56:04,704 --> 01:56:07,936
STRAIGHT. But magic, very dark magic….

1242
01:56:21,907 --> 01:56:23,784
....leaves his mark.

1243
01:56:31,604 --> 01:56:33,689
It's where you went, isn't it, sir?

1244
01:56:33,897 --> 01:56:36,087
~ When do you get out of the school?
~ Yes.

1245
01:56:37,025 --> 01:56:40,049
And I think you can
Maybe I found another one.

1246
01:56:40,258 --> 01:56:44,324
But this time,
I can’t wait to break it myself.

1247
01:56:45,888 --> 01:56:50,475
Ever,
I have to ask you a lot of questions, Harry.

1248
01:56:54,542 --> 01:56:56,731
Have you ever wo
what are you asking for so much….

1249
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:59,546
....what do you do so much?

1250
01:56:59,755 --> 01:57:04,759
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don’t want to do this anymore?

1251
01:57:04,968 --> 01:57:07,053
It doesn’t matter if it has or doesn’t.

1252
01:57:07,992 --> 01:57:13,726
I disagree with you, Severus. You got it. Nothing more to discuss.

1253
01:57:32,181 --> 01:57:33,745
Oh, Harry.

1254
01:57:36,351 --> 01:57:38,645
You need to shave, buddy.

1255
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,735
You know, sometimes,
I forget how much you’ve grown.

1256
01:57:45,839 --> 01:57:49,801
Sometimes, I still see the baby in the closet.

1257
01:57:51,365 --> 01:57:53,763
Forgive my inconvenience, Harry.

1258
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,744
I'm old.

1259
01:57:55,849 --> 01:57:57,517
It still looks the same to me, sir.

1260
01:57:58,977 --> 01:58:02,000
Like your mother,
you are so kind.

1261
01:58:02,209 --> 01:58:05,337
Something people never stop appreciating, I’m afraid.

1262
01:58:08,152 --> 01:58:12,635
The place we're going tonight is very dangerous.

1263
01:58:12,844 --> 01:58:16,284
I promised you that you could follow me, and I am keeping that promise.

1264
01:58:16,493 --> 01:58:18,265
But there’s a catch:

1265
01:58:18,474 --> 01:58:21,706
You must obey all my commands without question.

1266
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:24,208
Yes, sir.

1267
01:58:24,417 --> 01:58:26,502
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1268
01:58:27,128 --> 01:58:29,526
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1269
01:58:29,734 --> 01:58:32,028
If I have to tell you to run, you run.

1270
01:58:32,237 --> 01:58:36,199
If I tell you to leave me alone, you must do it.

1271
01:58:41,412 --> 01:58:42,976
Your words, Harry.

1272
01:58:44,644 --> 01:58:46,104
My voice.

1273
01:58:46,938 --> 01:58:48,606
Take my hand off.

1274
01:58:50,066 --> 01:58:52,464
Sir, I thought you couldn't show up at Hogwarts.

1275
01:58:53,089 --> 01:58:56,530
Well, being me, it has its perks.

1276
01:59:43,866 --> 01:59:45,430
This is the place.

1277
01:59:46,264 --> 01:59:47,828
Oh, yes.

1278
01:59:48,766 --> 01:59:51,269
This place knows magic.

1279
01:59:59,297 --> 02:00:00,861
~ Lord!
~ To earn a way….

1280
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,425
....must pay.

1281
02:00:02,633 --> 02:00:06,282
Fixed price
to encourage any intrusion.

1282
02:00:07,846 --> 02:00:09,619
~ You should have let me, sir.
~ No, Harry.

1283
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:12,851
Your blood is more precious than mine.

1284
02:00:34,746 --> 02:00:39,334
Voldemort doesn't make it easy to figure out where he's hiding.

1285
02:00:39,543 --> 02:00:42,879
He will add some security to his work.

1286
02:00:45,486 --> 02:00:46,841
Careful.

1287
02:01:10,405 --> 02:01:11,552
It’s there.

1288
02:01:13,011 --> 02:01:15,722
Just one question,
how do we get there?

1289
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:39,703
If you please, Harry.

1290
02:02:27,038 --> 02:02:29,436
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”

- Where's my box? Where is my tree?
- I do not know.

- Harry Potter, give me my wand.
- I don't have it.

- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.

01:44:31,704 --> 01:44:33,729
Just my name.

1103
01:44:34,506 --> 01:44:36,599
As a matter of fact.

1104
01:44:38,577 --> 01:44:44,573
So I took it, pushed it,
and this little speck of light appeared.

1105
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,483
And I knew it.

1106
01:44:47,052 --> 01:44:51,682
And sure enough, he ran towards me,
the light...

1107
01:44:53,392 --> 01:44:57,590
... went straight to my head,
straight at me. Here.

1108
01:44:58,797 --> 01:45:02,790
And I knew he was taking me
where was I supposed to go, so I got lost...

1109
01:45:02,968 --> 01:45:05,232
...and came to this mountain.

1110
01:45:05,771 --> 01:45:08,296
It was dark. I didn’t know where I was.

01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:11,674

that one of you would show up.

will he stay mad at me?

01:45:42,574 --> 01:45:45,907
Well, just talk about the
a little gem of light that tugs at your heartstrings…

...and he's coming.

1117
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,410
It was real. All words.

1118

This news is so bad...

1119
01:45:55,054 --> 01:45:59,423
…but I think that’s why Dumbledore
left me, the Deluminator.

1120
01:45:59,925 --> 01:46:04,919
I think he knew that sometimes he would have to
to find my way back, and he will lead me.

- Whether.
- I've got one here.

01:46:13,472 --> 01:46:16,066
It is a dark brown tree. Ten inches.

Finally, the brothers came to a river
that could not pass.

But being trained in magical arts...

1183
01:50:50,916 --> 01:50:56,081
… the three brothers just
they beat their sticks and built a bridge.

1184
01:50:57,422 --> 01:50:59,515
Before they could get through, though...

1185
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:03,787
… found their way blocked
with a bearded man.

1186
01:51:04,062 --> 01:51:07,930
It was death, and he felt betrayed.

1187
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:11,160
Misleading for tourists
they would have been in the river for a long time.

1188
01:51:11,336 --> 01:51:13,395
But Death was tricky.

1189
01:51:14,039 --> 01:51:17,031
He pretended to thank them
the three brothers with their magic...

1190
01:51:17,209 --> 01:51:22,476
… and said each earned a reward for
he was smart enough to resist.

1191
01:51:23,048 --> 01:51:27,610
The oldest asked for a stick
which is stronger than what exists.

1192
01:51:27,786 --> 01:51:32,382
So Death created a
from a large tree nearby.

1193
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:38,092
The second brother thought he wanted
will mock Death still...

1194
01:51:38,263 --> 01:51:42,700
… and asked for the ability
to comfort loved ones of the deceased.

1195
01:51:43,135 --> 01:51:47,435
So Death threw a stone out of the river
and gave it to him.

1196
01:51:48,173 --> 01:51:52,132
After,
Death turned to his third brother.

1197
01:51:53,345 --> 01:51:54,778
A humble man...

1198
01:51:54,946 --> 01:51:59,144
... asked for something that would leave
get out of the country...

1199
01:51:59,318 --> 01:52:02,481
…will not be followed by death .

1200
01:52:03,588 --> 01:52:09,458
And so it was that Death didn’t want to
giving him his invisibility cloak.

1201
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:15,766
The first brother went
in a remote village...

1202
01:52:15,934 --> 01:52:18,027
…somewhere, with the Elder Wand in hand…

1203
01:52:18,203 --> 01:52:21,969
... killed a witch
with whom he argued.

1204
01:52:24,176 --> 01:52:27,703
Shine with the energy
that the Elder Wand had given him…

1205
01:52:27,879 --> 01:52:30,973
… he was proud that he couldn’t get it.

1206
01:52:33,985 --> 01:52:37,443
But that night,
another witch stole the tree…

1207
01:52:37,622 --> 01:52:40,750
... and hugged his brother
for good measure.

1208
01:52:40,959 --> 01:52:44,395
And so Death took the first brother
for his own.

1209
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:47,098
The second brother went
home...

1210
01:52:47,265 --> 01:52:50,234
...where he threw the stone
and struck him three times with his hand.

1211
01:52:50,402 --> 01:52:54,862
Fortunately, the girl who originally wanted
marrying him before he died...

1212
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,406
... appeared before him.

1213
01:52:57,909 --> 01:53:03,211
However, he quickly became depressed and cold
for it was not of the mortal world.

1214
01:53:03,382 --> 01:53:05,009
I am saddened by a hopeless longing...

1215
01:53:05,183 --> 01:53:08,482
... the second brother committed suicide
because he wanted to be with her.

1216
01:53:09,688 --> 01:53:12,782
And so Death took the second brother.

1217
01:53:12,958 --> 01:53:14,585
As for the third brother…

1218
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,992
…Death searched for years
but he could never find it.

1219
01:53:19,164 --> 01:53:22,065
It was only after he had spent so many years,
his younger brother...

1220
01:53:22,234 --> 01:53:26,500
... takes off the invisibility cloak
and gives it to his son.

1221
01:53:27,739 --> 01:53:31,869
He then greeted Death as an old friend
and went with him gladly...

1222
01:53:32,043 --> 01:53:35,206

00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,443
I’m afraid I need to brace myself.

136
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,652
HARRY Empire.

137
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:24,323
Very well, Mrs. Lestrange.
If you follow me.

138
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,699
What is it, Griphook?

139
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,437
Griphook.

140
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,917
Stop momentum.

141
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,930
Well done, Hermione.

142
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,107
No, you look like yourself again.

143
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:49,578
The Fallen Thief.
It purifies all senses.

144
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,840
It can be deadly.

145
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,643
You don't say.

146
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,810
Just because I want to,
Is there another way out of here?

147
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,649
No.

148
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,526
What the hell are you all doing down here?

149
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:03,922
Thieves!

150
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,360
- When you gave him the keys, you...
- Empire.

151
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:19,637
That doesn’t sound good.

152
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,387
Bloody hell.

153
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,057
That’s a Ukrainian Ironbelly.

154
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,582
Here.

155
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,571
He has learned to expect
anxiety when he hears the commotion.

156
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,264
It’s barbaric.

157
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,906
Lumos.

158
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,568
Blimey.

159
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,847
Accio Horcrux.

160
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,490
You won’t try that again, will you?

161
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,357
That kind of magic
won’t work here.

162
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,557
Is he here, Harry?

163
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,835
Can you feel something?

164
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,152
That's it. Up there.

165
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,095
They’ve added the Gemino challenge.
Everything you touch will increase.

166
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,602
Give me the sword.

167
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,282
Stop.

168
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,145
Got it.

169
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,374
We had a deal, Griphook.

170
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,916
The cup for the sword.

171
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:24,618
I said I'd let you in. I didn’t say
anything to get you out.

172
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,310
Griphook!

173
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,147
- Thieves! Support!
-Griphook!

174
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,152
Thieves!

175
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,760
Nasty little git.
So we still have Bogrod.

176
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,660
It’s too bad.

177
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,836
We can't just stop here. Does anyone have any ideas?

178
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,534
You’re the smart one.

179
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,976
I've got something, but it's stupid.

180
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,479
Reduct.

181
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,521
Well, come on, then.

182
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,225
Relationship.

183
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,815
Keep it up! Aah!

184
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:52,569
Now what?

185
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,075
Reduct.

186
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,712
Wait.

187
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:10,160
That was pretty cool.
It’s really cool.

188
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,251
We fall.

189
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,491
- I say we're playing.
-When?

190
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,028
Now.

191
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,421
He knows. You-Know-Who.

192
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,208
He knows we went into Gringotts.

193
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,554
He knows what we are taking and he
he knows we’re looking for Horcruxes.

194
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,524
- How do you know?
- This is with your eyes.

195
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,163
Did you let him in? Harry,
you can't do that.

196
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,892
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I do not know.

197
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,763
Never mind. What happened?

198
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,734
Yes, he is angry.

199
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:02,463
And scared too.

200
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:06,310
He knows that if we find and destroy all
Horcruxes we can kill.

201
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,974
I think he would stand for anything
make sure we don't find the others.

202
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:13,446
There are others.
One of them is at Hogwarts.

203
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,313
What is?

204
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,149
- Did you see him?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.

205
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,883
It must have something to do with him.
We need to go there now.

206
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,358
We can't do that. We need to be prepared.
We need to fix it.

207
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,657
Hermione, when you have one of our
the strategy that actually worked?

208
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:30,232
We plan, we get there,
all fires are open.

209
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,631
He's right.

210
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:37,036
One problem: Snape's mentor now.
We can’t just walk in the front door.

211
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:41,975
Um, okay, we’re going to Hogsmeade,
for Honeydukes.

212
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,479
Take the Secret
visit to the basement.

213
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,016
It's... There's something
it’s not good for him.

214
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:52,520
So, you know, in the past, I
he was always able to follow his own ideas.

215
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,558
And now everything just seems disconnected.

216
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,024
It could be the Horcruxes.

217
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,355
Maybe he’s getting older. Maybe he's going to die.

218
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,492
No. No, it’s more
as he is sick.

219
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,465
If anything,
he feels very dangerous.

220
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,002
VOLDEMORT

221
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:56,987
MAN 1: They're here! STEP 2:
Look everywhere!

222
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,698
MAN 1: Look down at the stables!
You guys come with me!

223
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,848
What signal?

224
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,425
Potter!

225
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,123
Here, Potter.

226
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,606
Are you paying attention?

227
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,571
-For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.

228
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,524
Harry?

229
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,724
I can see you in this.

230
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,471
You are stupid. Which were
Are you thinking of coming here?

231
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,911
Do you have an idea
how dangerous is that?

232
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,746
It was Aberforth,
Dumbledore's brother.

233
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,191
You’re the one I’ve got
I saw it here.

234
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,549
You’re the one who sent Dobby.

235
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,022
Where have you left it?

236
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,757
He's dead.

237
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,353
Sorry to hear it. I liked the elf.

238
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,466
Who gave you that? The mirror?

239
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,267
Mundungus Fletcher,
a year ago.

240
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,702
-Dung had no control. Goods...
- Sirius.

241
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,072
Albus told me.

242
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:02,874
He also told me you can be scammed
if you ever find out I had...

243
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:07,950
…but ask yourself,
where would you be if I didn’t?

244
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,618
Do you hear much about the others?
In the Law?

245
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,759
The Order is gone.

246
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,292
You-Know-Who won.

247
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,863
Anyone who says otherwise
they are only lying to themselves.

248
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,557
We need to enter
Hogwarts, tonight.

249
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,697
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

250
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,531
Is he now?

251
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,139
Good job? Easy?

252
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,243
We’re looking for Horcruxes.

253
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:37,014
Assuming the latter is inside the building,
but we'll need help getting in.

254
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,712
That's not a job my brother gave you.
It’s a suicide mission.

255
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,252
Please, young man, go home.
Live a little longer.

256
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:49,086
- Dumbledore trusted me to look into this matter.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

257
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:52,229
You think you can believe it
what did my brother say to you?

258
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,996
In the days that you have known Christ,
“Did he ever say my name?”

259
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,095
Did he ever mention himself?

260
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,967
- Why does he have to...?
- Keeping it locked up? You told me.

261
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,467
- I trusted him.
- That's a young man's answer.

262
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,739
A boy who goes hunting for Horcruxes
in the words of a man...

263
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,745
...who would never tell
where to start. You're lying!

264
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,119
Except for me, that doesn’t make any sense.
For you too.

265
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,314
That's what a fool does.

266
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:24,393
You don't strike me as stupid, Harry Potter.

267
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:29,226
So I'll ask you again.
There has to be something.

268
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,579
I don’t like what happened
between you and your brother.

269
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,537
I don't care if you've left.

270
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,606
I trusted the man I knew.

271
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,811
And we need to get into the house tonight.

272
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,492
You know what to do.

273
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,035
Where did you send it?

274
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,064
You’ll see soon enough.

275
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,043
He is your brother,
Ariana, right?

276
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,750
He died too young, didn’t he?

277
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:26,418
My brother gave
many things, Mr. Potter…

278
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,082
...on his way to find power...

279
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,524
…including Ariana.

280
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:34,830
And he was devoted to her.

281
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,867
He gave it his all...

282
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:40,565
...but time.

283
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,339
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

284
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,707
He saved us twice.

285
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,513
Look at me in the mirror.

286
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,815
That doesn’t seem like
one who is dedicated.

287
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,090
He’ll be back.

288
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,959
Who is that with?

289
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:19,300
Neville.

290
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,002
- Oh, I see...
- Like fire, I think.

291
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,774
This is nothing. Seamus is terrible.

292
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,978
Look, Ab, we have a
a couple more to come.

293
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:32,222
Ignore this on the Marauder's Map.

294
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,291
That’s because it never
existed until now.

295
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,727
The Seventh Secret Path was sealed
completed before the start of the year.

296
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,491
This is the only way in or out for now.

297
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:42,466
The field revolves around
Death and Dementors.

298
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,196
How bad of a teacher is Snape?

299
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:47,438
I never see it. It is the
Carrows you need to protect.

300
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,522
Cars?

301
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,143
Whether. Brother and sister.
In education policy.

302
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,049
They like closure, the Carrows.

303
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,202
Did they do that to you? Why?

304
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:59,042
At this point the Dark Arts course had us
perform the Cruciatus Curse.

305
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,117
In the first year.

306
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,116
I didn’t want to.

307
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:06,048
Hogwarts had changed.

308
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:21,404
Let’s have some fun, shall we?

309
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,446
Listen, you guys.
It brought you a blessing.

310
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,710
No more than Aberforth cooks, I hope.
Be a surprise if you can eat it.

311
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,646
Blimey.

312
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,154
- Harry!
- Whether!

313
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,727
Say the word to Remus and
the rest of Harry turned.

314
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:58,175
Okay, let’s not kill
before You-Know-Who...

315
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,700
River, DA is playing. Do you read?

316
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,903
Lightning has struck.

317
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,741
What plans, Harry?

318
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,670
Good.

319
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,715
There is something to explore.

320
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:18,851
Something is hidden here in the house.
And it can help us defeat You-Know-Who.

321
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,827
Right. What is that?

322
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,158
We don’t know.

323
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,036
- Where is?
- We don't know that either.

324
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,637
- I know we don't have to do much.
- That's not going to happen.

325
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,277
I think it has something
what to do with Ravenclaw.

326
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:39,109
Um, it will be small,
it’s easily hidden.

327
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,111
Anyone, an idea?

328
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,945
Well, there’s Rowena
Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

329
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,523
Oh, so much blood. Here we go.

330
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,752
Have you lost the Ravenclaw diadem?

331
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,195
Has no one heard?
They’re really popular.

332
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,733
Yes, but, Luna, is gone,
for many years now.

333
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,701
There is no living human
now who has seen it.

334
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:04,241
Excuse me. Can anyone tell
me what is a diadem of blood?

335
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,972
It's a kind of crown.
You know, like a tiara.

336
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,510
Harry.

337
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:14,080
Hi there.

338
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:20,490
Six months of not seeing me and
it’s like I’m Frankie from first grade.

339
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,301
- Your niece.
- I have a lot of that.

340
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:24,724
- There's only one Harry.
- Smile, Seamus.

341
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,385
What is it, Ginny?

342
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,762
Snape knows. He knows the
Harry was seen in Hogsmeade.

343
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:15,377
Many of you are really wondering why
I'm calling you at this time.

344
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:21,614
It came to my attention
for the first time tonight...

345
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,318
…Harry Potter saw him in Hogsmeade.

346
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,417
Now...

347
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,185
…we need someone…

348
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:38,096
…student or employee,
try to help Mr. Potter…

349
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:41,363
...will be punished...

350
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,999
...in a similar way to the
their sin is great.

351
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,407
Also...

352
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:53,443
… anyone who shows up has
knowledge of the following...

353
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,721
…which cannot be proven…

354
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:04,219
...will be treated as...

355
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:08,092
...the same culprits.

356
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,232
Safe...

357
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,799
…if anyone here…

358
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:24,441
...has some knowledge of Mr.
Potter's walk tonight...

359
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,552
…I invite them out…

360
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,786
...now.

361
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:54,343
Apparently, no matter how busy you are
defense strategies...

362
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,282
…you still have some
safety concerns, teacher.

363
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,676
And I'm afraid it's
huge.

364
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,515
How dare you stand where he stood?

365
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,252
Tell them how
passed that night.

366
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:14,956
Tell them how you feel.
a man who believed in you and killed him.

367
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,993
Tell them.

368
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:42,909
Coward!

369
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,437
Harry.

370
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,733
Potter?

371
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:36,938
I’m sure many of you
will want to fight.

372
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:42,142
Some of you may be wondering
that resistance is wisdom.

373
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,613
But this is nonsense.

374
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,923
Give me Harry Potter.

375
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:54,058
Do this and no one will be hurt.

376
00:38:54,231 --> 00:39:00,261
Give me Harry Potter and Me
leaving Hogwarts unaffected.

377
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:03,372
Give me Harry Potter…

378
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:07,477
…and you’ll be rewarded.

379
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,240
You have an hour.

380
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,959
What are you waiting for?

381
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,458
Someone should catch him.

382
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,304
Students get out of bed.

383
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,370
Students get out of bed!

384
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,100
Students in the hallway!

385
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,678
They need to get out of bed,
you are stupid.

386
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,516
Oh.

387
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,134
I'm sorry, ma'am.

388
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,187
As it happens, Mr. Filch,
your touch is the best.

389
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,654
If you wanted to,
I’d love to, please…

390
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:59,319
…to guide Miss Parkinson and the
other members of House Slytherin from the hall.

391
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,065
Where is I'll do
Are you leading, woman?

392
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,830
The prison would.

393
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,633
Right. Come on. Come on.

394
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:13,276
I think you have something to fall back on,
Potter. What do you want?

395
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,837
Time, teacher. How can you beat me.

396
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:20,008
Do what you have to do.
I will defend the castle.

397
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,476
Potter.

398
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,185
Good to see you.

399
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,456
It’s so good to see you too,
teacher.

400
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,290
Hold the wall, Neville.

401
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,590
Hurry up, come on!

402
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,334
Harry. Hermione and I agreed.

403
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,444
It doesn’t matter if
we find a Horcrux.

404
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,842
- What do you mean?
- Only if we can destroy it.

405
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:52,279
So we thought…

406
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:54,979
Ron thought.
It was Ron's idea. It’s really cool.

407
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,309
You ripped off Tom Riddle’s book
with a basilisk mouth, right?

408
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,652
Hermione and I know
where can we find one.

409
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,589
Good.

410
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,491
Okay, but get this. So you
you can find me when you get back.

411
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:08,898
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.

412
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,423
You have to start somewhere.

413
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,236
Harry.

414
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,933
Harry!

415
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,600
Let me get this straightened out.

416
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,738
- Do you give us permission to do this?
- That's right, Longbottom.

417
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,349
To store it? Boom?

418
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,008
Boom!

419
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,587
Evil. But how on earth
Are we going to do that?

420
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,088
Why don’t you propose
with Mr. Finnigan?

421
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,820
As I recall, he has something
love of pyrotechnics.

422
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,046
I can find it.

423
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,563
That’s the spirit. Now go.

424
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:46,969
You know, of course, they can’t
stay You-Know-Who forever.

425
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,133
Well, that doesn’t mean we can’t leave.

426
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:55,302
And his name was Voldemort, Filius.
You can use it too.

427
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,380
He will try
they will kill you for whatever reason.

428
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,950
Piertotum Locomotor.

429
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,300
Hogwarts is in danger.

430
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:27,672
Respect the boundaries. Save us.
Meet the requirements of our course.

431
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,412
I’ve always wanted
to use the term.

432
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,229
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

433
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:51,026
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

434
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:55,968
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

435
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,801
Protego Maxima.

436
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:30,406
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a little worried these days, Luna.

437
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,376
You won’t find anywhere
will go. You’re just wasting your time.

438
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,545
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.

439
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:36,945
- Later.
- Harry Potter!

440
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,048
Now listen to me!

441
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,981
Don’t you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem?

442
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:47,022
"No one has seen him."

443
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:51,890
Obvious, right?
We need to talk to someone who has died.

444
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,070
Pretty amazing, isn’t it?

445
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,052
If you want to find it,
you’ll find it down there.

446
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,660
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

447
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,319
I think it’s great if
you are talking to yourselves.

448
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,692
He is very shy.

449
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,750
You're a black woman...

450
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:00,291
...the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

451
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,193
I don’t answer to that name.

452
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,928
No, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
That’s Helena, isn’t it? Helena Ravenclaw.

453
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,231
Rowena’s daughter.

454
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,431
Are you Luna’s friend?

455
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,542
Whether.

456
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,178
And he thought maybe
can you help me.

457
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,675
You're looking for my mother's hat.

458
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:23,880
Whether.

459
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:25,846
That's true.

460
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:32,255
Luna is good, not like the others.

461
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,489
But he’s not real.
I can't help you.

462
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,571
Wait. Please.

463
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,299
I want to destroy it.

464
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,805
They never learn.

465
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,977
Very sad.

466
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:33,586
But, my Lord...

467
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,021
…shouldn’t we wait…?

468
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,922
My Lord.

469
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,567
Begin.

470
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:07,520
That’s what you want too, isn’t it, Helena?

471
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,358
You want it destroyed.

472
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,557
Another vowed to destroy
it's been years...

473
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,601
...a young stranger
under a different name.

474
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,604
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.

475
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,974
He has fooled many people.

476
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:28,236
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!

477
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,313
Corrupted by dark magic!

478
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,993
I can destroy it once and for all.

479
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:54,937
But unless you say
I'm where he burned it.

480
00:47:56,907 --> 00:48:02,675
You know where he burned it.
don’t you, Helena?

481
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,682
You just have to tell me.

482
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,948
Please.

483
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,996
Strange.

484
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,964
It reminds me a little bit of him.

485
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,436
Here it is…

486
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:37,376
...in the castle, in the
where everything is hidden.

487
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,982
In case you need to ask...

488
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,449
...you never know.

489
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:48,390
If you know, all you have to do is ask.

490
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,254
Thank you.

491
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:08,307
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and l
will do this side of the castle.

492
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,875
Yes, sir.

493
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,412
See, Dean, on second thought,
tell Professor McGonagall...

494
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,385
…you may need an o
two more boxes on this side.

495
00:49:20,386 --> 00:49:26,061
It is the quality of one’s belief
that determines quality...

496
00:49:26,062 --> 00:49:27,825
…not the number of followers.

497
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,989
Who said that?

498
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:31,991
Me.

499
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,674
Are you okay, Freddie?

500
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,475
Whether.

501
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,640
Me too.

502
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:04,359
Harry mutters in his bed. You know?

503
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,260
No, of course not.

504
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,478
Whether?

505
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,143
You and whose soldiers?

506
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,002
- You do.
- I can't.

507
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:22,269
Yes, you can.

508
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:21,983
Neville!

509
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,075
That went well.

510
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:31,284
Come on in! Like, everything. Cover up!

511
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,775
Get lost!

512
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,639
Put on your clothes!

513
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:56,910
Ginny. Neville. Are you okay?

514
00:55:57,086 --> 00:56:01,614
It’s never been better. I feel like I could breathe fire.
You haven’t seen Luna, have you?

515
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,622
- Luna?
- I'm angry with him!

516
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:08,093
I think it’s time to tell him because
we may both be dead by morning.

517
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,831
I know.

518
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,225
Bloody hell. Good
you’ll never find it in this one.

519
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,062
-There it is, just there.
- Bright.

520
00:56:47,236 --> 00:56:50,501
It just disappeared.
Just now. I saw it.

521
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,776
Maybe he went to the right place.

522
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:59,270
Not shown on the map,
does? You mentioned that last year.

523
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,781
That's true. I... did.

524
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,646
Let's go.

525
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,083
Bright.

526
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,355
Come on!

527
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:06,605
Okay, okay.

528
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,636
What brings you here, Potter?

529
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,345
I could ask you too.

530
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,008
You have something for me.

531
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,409
I would like him back.

532
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,122
-What's wrong with what you have?
- My mother's.

533
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:23,991
Really strong,
but not the same.

534
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,789
He doesn’t really understand me.

535
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:29,764
You know what I mean?

536
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,300
Why didn't you tell him?

537
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,164
Bellatrix.

538
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,508
You knew it was me.

539
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,768
You didn’t say anything.

540
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:44,810
Come on, Draco.

541
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,144
Don't be a fool. Do it already.

542
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:50,282
Easy.

543
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:52,984
Expelliarmus.

544
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,206
Avada Kedavra!

545
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,407
Get lost!

546
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,888
That’s my girl, you guys!

547
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,114
Got it.

548
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,260
Run!

549
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:36,692
Run!

550
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:43,603
Goyle puts the
a land on fire!

551
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,506
Come on! This way!

552
01:01:59,815 --> 01:02:01,806
We can't leave them.

553
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,145
He’s funny, isn’t he?

554
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:15,661
If we die for them, Harry,
I'm going to kill you.

555
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,015
Harry!

556
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,766
My boss?

557
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,462
Avada Kedavra!

558
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:41,078
Come on, Nagini.
I have to protect you.

559
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,293
It's the snake.

560
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:59,059
He’s the last one.
It’s the last Horcrux.

561
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,141
Look inside, Harry.

562
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:12,076
Find out where he is.
If we find it, we can find the snake.

563
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:14,375
Then we can turn this off.

564
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,807
My boss?

565
01:04:43,979 --> 01:04:47,847
It could be smaller, uh...

566
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:52,917
Can’t it be more sensible
to end this war...

567
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,988
…and just look for
the boy you?

568
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:59,491
I don’t have to look for the boy.

569
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:04,065
Before it gets dark,
he will come to me. Do you understand?

570
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,992
Look at me.

571
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,129
How can you live with
are you, Lucius?

572
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,071
I do not know.

573
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,703
Go find Severus.

574
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,374
Bring it to me.

575
01:05:29,391 --> 01:05:31,416
I know where he is.

576
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,196
Come on!

577
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,372
Crucious!

578
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,553
No!

579
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,951
You are doing the most important
magic with this wand, my lord...

580
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,129
…except in the last few hours.

581
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,069
No.

582
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,807
No, I’m not big…

583
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:33,608
...but the tree is holding me back.

584
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:36,842
There is no stronger tree.

585
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,817
Ollivander himself said.

586
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:45,621
Tonight when the boy comes,
he will not fail you. I know about that.

587
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,496
Answering...

588
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,699
…and only you.

589
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:55,926
Depend?

590
01:07:58,929 --> 01:08:00,453
My boss?

591
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:07,100
The tree, making
did you really answer me?

592
01:08:08,872 --> 01:08:10,965
You're a smart man, Severus.

593
01:08:11,141 --> 01:08:13,041
You definitely need to know.

594
01:08:14,745 --> 01:08:18,442
Where is his true faith?

595
01:08:18,949 --> 01:08:20,712
You're...

596
01:08:21,218 --> 01:08:23,311
...of course, my lord.

597
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:24,681
The big tree...

598
01:08:25,489 --> 01:08:31,291
…can’t serve me properly
for I am not the true owner.

599
01:08:32,396 --> 01:08:37,891
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed his last master.

600
01:08:43,807 --> 01:08:47,470
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

601
01:08:48,345 --> 01:08:53,612
While you’re at it, the manager
Wand can’t really be mine.

602
01:08:55,085 --> 01:08:58,816
You are a good and
faithful servant, Severus...

603
01:08:59,323 --> 01:09:04,386
...but only I can live forever.

604
01:09:07,698 --> 01:09:08,748
My Lord...

605
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:16,831
Nagini, kill him.

606
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,602
Take them.

607
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:22,705
Take them.

608
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,007
Please.

609
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:28,872
Give me something. Prompt.
A flask, anything.

610
01:10:47,197 --> 01:10:48,664
Take them to Pensieve.

611
01:10:52,236 --> 01:10:54,204
Look at me.

612
01:10:59,943 --> 01:11:02,673
You have your mother’s eyes.

613
01:11:36,346 --> 01:11:39,907
You are fighting hard...

614
01:11:41,318 --> 01:11:44,048
...but in vain.

615
01:11:47,357 --> 01:11:49,621
I don’t want this.

616
01:11:49,793 --> 01:11:55,322
Every bloodline of magic
spilled is a dangerous waste.

617
01:11:55,499 --> 01:12:00,266
So I order
let my soldiers retreat.

618
01:12:00,437 --> 01:12:05,966
In their absence,
dispose of your dead with respect.

619
01:12:06,476 --> 01:12:12,506
Harry Potter,
Now I'm telling you the truth.

620
01:12:12,683 --> 01:12:18,053
Tonight, you let
your friends die for you...

621
01:12:18,222 --> 01:12:20,713
...don't face me yourself.

622
01:12:20,891 --> 01:12:24,452
There is nothing worse.

623
01:12:24,628 --> 01:12:29,588
Join me on the Forbidden
Land and face your destiny.

624
01:12:30,834 --> 01:12:33,428
If you don’t do this…

625
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:40,305
...I will kill every last one,
woman and child...

626
01:12:40,477 --> 01:12:45,039
...who tries
hide me from me.

627
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:06,535
Where is everyone?

628
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:32,378
Harry.

629
01:13:38,035 --> 01:13:40,799
Oh, come on. What happened to you?

630
01:13:40,971 --> 01:13:42,598
Oh, it’s over.

631
01:13:44,408 --> 01:13:46,899
There, he went.

632
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:56,689
Freak!

633
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,330
Come here.

634
01:15:58,508 --> 01:16:00,567
I’ll tell my mom.
You are a failure.

635
01:16:00,744 --> 01:16:03,178
“You’re a bad person, Lily!”

636
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:04,938
Come here.

637
01:16:25,936 --> 01:16:29,235
He is jealous because he
it’s free and you are special.

638
01:16:29,406 --> 01:16:31,931
That's bad, Severus.

639
01:16:54,764 --> 01:16:56,823
Gryffindor!

640
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:07,309
- Hello. I’m James.
- Hello. I'm Lily.

641
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:16,012
Just like your father.
Lazy. Arrogant.

642
01:17:16,186 --> 01:17:18,017
Don't say a word about my father.

643
01:17:24,327 --> 01:17:25,919
Blood will be spilled...

644
01:17:26,096 --> 01:17:31,090
…and servants and masters
they will meet again.

645
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:33,168
Severus.

646
01:17:34,237 --> 01:17:36,228
No. Don't kill me.

647
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:40,240
The translation does not
say a woman.

648
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,674
Said a boy who was born
at the end of July.

649
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:45,076
Yes, but he thinks he's his son.

650
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:48,845
He wants to fight them now,
to kill them.

651
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:53,513
Turn it on. Burn them all. I'm asking you.

652
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:56,784
What will you give me in return, Severus?

653
01:17:58,528 --> 01:17:59,578
Nothing.

654
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:04,462
Harry. Harry,
they love you so much. Like love.

655
01:18:05,468 --> 01:18:08,130
Harry, my mother loves you.

656
01:18:08,305 --> 01:18:11,206
Dada loves you.

657
01:18:12,075 --> 01:18:14,236
Harry, be careful.

658
01:18:14,411 --> 01:18:15,461
Be strong.

659
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:17,102
Avada Kedavra!

660
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:26,078
You said you would take care of it.

661
01:18:26,256 --> 01:18:30,283
Lily and James put their faith
to the wrong person, Severus.

662
01:18:31,261 --> 01:18:33,320
Kind of like you.

663
01:18:35,465 --> 01:18:36,932
The boy survived.

664
01:18:36,933 --> 01:18:39,535
He doesn't need to be taken care of.
The Dark Lord is dead.

665
01:18:39,536 --> 01:18:41,766
The Night King returns.

666
01:18:41,938 --> 01:18:45,499
And when he does, the boy
you will be in grave danger.

667
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:49,042
She has eyes.

668
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:55,678
If you really loved her...

669
01:18:58,388 --> 01:19:02,222
No one can know.

670
01:19:02,392 --> 01:19:05,042
That way I’ll never show
the best of you, Severus?

671
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:06,111
Your voice.

672
01:19:06,262 --> 01:19:09,163
When you risk your life every
time to save the boy?

673
01:19:09,164 --> 01:19:13,068
He doesn't have any common sense.
his greatness rivals that of his father...

674
01:19:13,069 --> 01:19:14,934
…and seems to enjoy his fame.

675
01:19:15,105 --> 01:19:17,972
Don't say a word about my father.

676
01:19:18,141 --> 01:19:20,336
James Potter?

677
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,000
Lazy, very arrogant.

678
01:19:22,178 --> 01:19:23,509
My father was a great man.

679
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,580
Your father was a pig!

680
01:19:27,417 --> 01:19:29,078
Drink the rest.

681
01:19:29,252 --> 01:19:33,279
It will have the disadvantage of
hands for the day.

682
01:19:33,456 --> 01:19:35,390
Spread out, Albus.

683
01:19:35,558 --> 01:19:37,253
How long?

684
01:19:38,228 --> 01:19:40,696
Maybe a year.

685
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:44,159
Don't ignore me, Severus.

686
01:19:44,234 --> 01:19:45,724
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

687
01:19:45,902 --> 01:19:49,861
We both know Lord Voldemort has
ordered the young Malfoy to kill me.

688
01:19:51,941 --> 01:19:56,173
But if it doesn’t work out,
one has to consider the Dark Lord...

689
01:19:56,346 --> 01:19:58,473
...comes back to you.

690
01:20:01,217 --> 01:20:05,153
You must be
to kill me, Severus.

691
01:20:05,321 --> 01:20:07,482
It’s the only way.

692
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:12,827
Only then does the dark
God will trust you with all his heart.

693
01:20:12,996 --> 01:20:15,658
Avada Kedavra.

694
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:23,839
The time will come when Harry
Potter needs to be told something.

695
01:20:25,408 --> 01:20:30,607
But you have to wait until Voldemort
it’s where it’s most vulnerable.

696
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:33,681
What should they say?

697
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:35,875
The night Lord Voldemort…

698
01:20:36,052 --> 01:20:39,249
...walked over to Godric
Too bad to kill Harry...

699
01:20:40,256 --> 01:20:42,986
...and Lily Potter's reaction
himself among them…

700
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,694
… the curse repeated itself.

701
01:20:47,497 --> 01:20:51,126
When that happened,
a piece of Voldemort's soul...

702
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:56,136
... stuck in the
the only living thing he could show:

703
01:20:56,306 --> 01:20:58,433
Harry alone.

704
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:03,212
There’s a reason why Harry
he can talk to snakes.

705
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,613
There is a way to see
in the mind of Lord Voldemort.

706
01:21:08,985 --> 01:21:15,049
A part of Voldemort
lives in it.

707
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:24,433
So when the time comes…

708
01:21:25,335 --> 01:21:27,496
...the boy must die?

709
01:21:29,405 --> 01:21:31,430
Whether. Whether.

710
01:21:31,608 --> 01:21:33,872
He must die.

711
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:57,031
You have kept him alive to
he might die at the right time.

712
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:04,265
You have
like a pig to the slaughter.

713
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:08,843
Don’t tell me now that you’ve
growing up to take care of the boy?

714
01:22:13,349 --> 01:22:16,614
Expecto Patronum.

715
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:29,020
Lily.

716
01:22:32,302 --> 01:22:34,668
After all this time?

717
01:22:38,074 --> 01:22:40,201
Always.

718
01:22:45,348 --> 01:22:48,340
So when the time comes…

719
01:22:48,518 --> 01:22:51,510
...the boy must die?

720
01:22:51,688 --> 01:22:55,055
Whether. He must die.

721
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:58,217
And Voldemort himself has to do it.

722
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:00,856
That’s important.

723
01:24:05,895 --> 01:24:06,953
Where have you been?

724
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:10,293
- We thought you went into the woods.
- I'm going there now.

725
01:24:10,466 --> 01:24:13,435
Are you angry? No.

726
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:16,661
You can't give in to it.

727
01:24:20,009 --> 01:24:21,909
What is it, Harry?

728
01:24:23,446 --> 01:24:25,380
What is it that you know?

729
01:24:28,151 --> 01:24:30,745
There’s a reason I can hear it…

730
01:24:31,354 --> 01:24:32,582
...the Horcruxes.

731
01:24:35,091 --> 01:24:37,457
I think I’ve known for a while.

732
01:24:38,895 --> 01:24:41,159
And I think you have, too.

733
01:24:44,133 --> 01:24:47,296
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

734
01:24:48,037 --> 01:24:50,164
Kill the snake and
then it's just him.

735
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:12,411
I'm ready to die.

736
01:26:53,729 --> 01:26:56,163
The stone of resurrection.

737
01:27:25,828 --> 01:27:29,229
You are so brave, my love.

738
01:27:33,302 --> 01:27:35,167
Why are you here?

739
01:27:35,972 --> 01:27:37,769
All of you?

740
01:27:40,143 --> 01:27:42,304
We never left.

741
01:27:51,187 --> 01:27:52,779
Depend...?

742
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:54,717
Does it hurt too much?

743
01:27:55,758 --> 01:27:57,453
Dying?

744
01:27:58,394 --> 01:28:00,919
Faster than sleep.

745
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:07,132
You're leaving me, son.

746
01:28:07,303 --> 01:28:08,497
I'm sorry.

747
01:28:08,671 --> 01:28:12,163
I never wanted any
of you to die for me.

748
01:28:13,776 --> 01:28:15,368
And, Remus, your son…

749
01:28:15,545 --> 01:28:19,811
Others will tell him his
his mother and father died because of it.

750
01:28:19,982 --> 01:28:23,440
One day, he’ll understand.

751
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:36,722
Will you stay with me?

752
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:40,565
Until the end.

753
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,238
And he can't see you?

754
01:28:43,406 --> 01:28:45,067
No.

755
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:48,969
We’re here, you see.

756
01:29:03,526 --> 01:29:05,551
Stay close to me.

757
01:29:07,296 --> 01:29:09,457
Always.

758
01:29:24,213 --> 01:29:27,944
It’s not about him, my Lord.

759
01:29:43,399 --> 01:29:46,163
I thought it was coming.

760
01:30:27,009 --> 01:30:30,672
Harry? No! What are you doing here?

761
01:30:30,846 --> 01:30:32,143
Quiet!

762
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:45,423
Harry Potter.

763
01:30:48,531 --> 01:30:51,227
The boy who lived.

764
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:57,905
Come to die.

765
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:17,820
Avada Kedavra!

766
01:32:14,517 --> 01:32:15,916
You can't help it.

767
01:32:16,852 --> 01:32:17,902
Harry...

768
01:32:18,487 --> 01:32:20,751
...you're a handsome young man.

769
01:32:21,257 --> 01:32:25,159
You are a brave, strong man.

770
01:32:27,129 --> 01:32:29,097
Let's walk.

771
01:32:36,572 --> 01:32:38,802
Master, what is that?

772
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,536
Something that happens
of our support.

773
01:32:47,416 --> 01:32:50,681
A part of Voldemort
we were sent here to die.

774
01:32:51,053 --> 01:32:52,313
And where are we?

775
01:32:53,522 --> 01:32:57,481
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say we are?

776
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:59,389
Good...

777
01:32:59,562 --> 01:33:02,156
... seems to work
King's Cross station.

778
01:33:02,531 --> 01:33:04,829
It’s just cleaner.

779
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,230
And not all of the trains.

780
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:10,500
King’s Cross, really?

781
01:33:10,873 --> 01:33:14,434
This is, as they say, your party.

782
01:33:15,611 --> 01:33:18,603
I think by now you’ll know
between you and Voldemort...

783
01:33:18,781 --> 01:33:21,614
... are associated with
something other than that is going to happen...

784
01:33:21,784 --> 01:33:24,810
...that night at Godric's
Hollow all those years ago.

785
01:33:24,987 --> 01:33:26,716
Is it true then, sir?

786
01:33:26,889 --> 01:33:29,858
A part of him lives in me.
right?

787
01:33:30,192 --> 01:33:31,242
Did.

788
01:33:31,393 --> 01:33:36,194
It was just canceled a long time ago
by none other than Voldemort himself.

789
01:33:37,266 --> 01:33:41,965
You were the Horcrux already
I never meant to, Harry.

790
01:33:54,517 --> 01:33:56,041
I have to go back, don’t I?”

791
01:33:56,218 --> 01:33:58,118
Oh. It's your job.

792
01:33:58,287 --> 01:34:00,050
Do I have a choice?

793
01:34:00,222 --> 01:34:02,019
Oh, yes.

794
01:34:02,191 --> 01:34:05,024
We live in King's Cross, you say?

795
01:34:06,128 --> 01:34:10,929
I think, if you will,
you could get on a train.

796
01:34:12,334 --> 01:34:13,665
And where would it lead me?

797
01:34:15,237 --> 01:34:17,068
In.

798
01:34:35,057 --> 01:34:37,150
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

799
01:34:39,795 --> 01:34:40,845
STRAIGHT.

800
01:34:40,996 --> 01:34:43,794
- And the snake is still alive.
- Whether.

801
01:34:43,966 --> 01:34:46,526
And I have no reason to kill him.

802
01:34:47,069 --> 01:34:51,802
We will always be offered help at Hogwarts,
Harry, to your questions.

803
01:34:53,008 --> 01:34:56,705
I was always grateful in
my ability to change a word.

804
01:34:57,646 --> 01:35:00,774
Word is, in my not so humble opinion...

805
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:04,545
…our never-ending supply of magic…

806
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:09,054
...can do both
damage and corrects it.

807
01:35:09,692 --> 01:35:15,597
But I would, in this case,
replace my original line with this:

808
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:24,566
Support will always be provided on
Hogwarts for the right.

809
01:35:30,412 --> 01:35:33,176
Don't love the dead, Harry.

810
01:35:33,616 --> 01:35:35,641
Love the living.

811
01:35:36,218 --> 01:35:41,087
And, most importantly, all the
who live without love.

812
01:35:42,057 --> 01:35:47,461
Teacher, my mother
Patronus was a woman, right?

813
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:51,124
It is the same as
Professor Snape.

814
01:35:52,001 --> 01:35:54,094
Pretty impressive, don’t you think?

815
01:35:54,269 --> 01:35:59,229
Yes, if I think about it,
it doesn’t seem that important.

816
01:36:00,943 --> 01:36:03,104
I'm leaving now, Harry.

817
01:36:03,646 --> 01:36:04,977
Teacher?

818
01:36:09,485 --> 01:36:11,646
Is all this true?

819
01:36:12,321 --> 01:36:14,311
Or does it just happen
in my head?

820
01:36:14,323 --> 01:36:17,850
When it happens
in your head, Harry.

821
01:36:18,027 --> 01:36:21,793
Why should that mean
which is not true?

822
01:36:27,369 --> 01:36:30,964
Teacher? What should I do?

823
01:36:34,743 --> 01:36:36,506
Teacher?

824
01:36:39,882 --> 01:36:41,179
My boss?

825
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:43,477
Lord, are you sick? My boss?

826
01:36:43,652 --> 01:36:45,279
I don't need your help.

827
01:36:45,454 --> 01:36:48,150
No. Come on.

828
01:36:56,865 --> 01:36:58,696
The boy.

829
01:36:58,867 --> 01:37:00,801
Is he dead?

830
01:37:14,883 --> 01:37:17,078
Is he alive?

831
01:37:17,252 --> 01:37:19,447
Draco, alive?

832
01:37:46,115 --> 01:37:48,015
Dead.

833
01:39:14,803 --> 01:39:17,431
Who is Hagrid driving?

834
01:39:18,106 --> 01:39:19,937
Neville, who is he?

835
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:23,100
Harry Potter…

836
01:39:24,246 --> 01:39:25,736
...is dead.

837
01:39:25,914 --> 01:39:27,472
No! No!

838
01:39:27,649 --> 01:39:29,014
Silence.

839
01:39:32,821 --> 01:39:34,812
A stupid girl.

840
01:39:35,958 --> 01:39:39,394
Harry Potter is dead.

841
01:39:39,561 --> 01:39:44,692
From now on,
you put your faith in...

842
01:39:44,867 --> 01:39:45,925
...on him.

843
01:39:56,411 --> 01:39:58,743
Harry Potter is dead!

844
01:40:03,585 --> 01:40:07,043
And now it's time
to introduce yourself.

845
01:40:08,624 --> 01:40:11,354
Come and join us.

846
01:40:13,295 --> 01:40:14,990
Or die.

847
01:40:20,535 --> 01:40:21,585
Draco.

848
01:40:27,242 --> 01:40:29,107
Draco.

849
01:40:32,014 --> 01:40:33,914
Draco...

850
01:40:36,752 --> 01:40:38,652
...come.

851
01:40:49,631 --> 01:40:53,067
Ah. Well done, Draco.

852
01:40:53,869 --> 01:40:55,734
Well done.

853
01:41:18,293 --> 01:41:21,057
Well, I have to say I would
hoping for the best.

854
01:41:25,467 --> 01:41:28,368
And who might you be, young man?

855
01:41:29,638 --> 01:41:31,572
Neville Longbottom.

856
01:41:36,878 --> 01:41:40,575
Well, Neville, I know you can
find a place for yourself in our rural areas.

857
01:41:40,749 --> 01:41:42,979
I wish I could say something.

858
01:41:49,124 --> 01:41:54,892
Well, Neville, I’m sure we’ll all be
I love hearing what you have to say.

859
01:41:55,130 --> 01:42:00,568
- It doesn't matter that Harry left.
- Stop, Neville.

860
01:42:00,569 --> 01:42:03,163
People die every day.

861
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:08,901
Friends, family.

862
01:42:10,946 --> 01:42:12,504
Whether.

863
01:42:13,949 --> 01:42:16,110
We lost Harry tonight.

864
01:42:17,652 --> 01:42:22,146
But he is still with us, here.

865
01:42:23,158 --> 01:42:25,092
Also Fred...

866
01:42:26,094 --> 01:42:27,857
...and Remus.

867
01:42:28,964 --> 01:42:30,295
Tonks.

868
01:42:31,633 --> 01:42:33,533
All of them.

869
01:42:34,703 --> 01:42:36,967
They didn't die in vain.

870
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:43,168
But you will.

871
01:42:43,345 --> 01:42:45,711
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.

872
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:48,873
Harry’s heart skipped a beat for us.
For all of us.

873
01:42:49,051 --> 01:42:50,643
This is not over!

874
01:42:54,756 --> 01:42:56,587
Join us!

875
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,458
No! No, come back!

876
01:43:06,635 --> 01:43:10,571
Lucius! Come back!
Come back and fight!

877
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:12,798
Come back!

878
01:43:17,846 --> 01:43:21,009
I will lure him into the castle.
We need to kill the snake.

879
01:43:21,183 --> 01:43:23,083
- you'll need this.
- Neville!

880
01:46:16,625 --> 01:46:19,150
Not my daughter, you bastard.

881
01:46:52,627 --> 01:46:53,958
You're right...

882
01:46:55,730 --> 01:46:58,062
…when you told Snape
the tree was supporting you.

883
01:46:58,233 --> 01:46:59,894
It will always haunt you.

884
01:47:01,202 --> 01:47:02,760
I killed Snape.

885
01:47:02,937 --> 01:47:05,227
But what if the tree
was it never Snape's?

886
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:08,107
What if his faith was
always with someone else?

887
01:47:08,276 --> 01:47:11,473
Come on, Tom. Let’s finish
this is how we started.

888
01:47:11,946 --> 01:47:12,996
Together.

889
01:50:44,993 --> 01:50:49,630
- Ha, ha.
- I always thought he was going to be great.

890
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:53,965
I couldn’t find my box.
I haven’t lost my tree in my entire life.

891
01:50:54,135 --> 01:50:56,126
It was lost in
half of my clothes.

892
01:50:56,304 --> 01:50:59,102
I was able to find it and I
sent some of them...

893
01:50:59,274 --> 01:51:00,502
Harry.

894
01:52:00,969 --> 01:52:04,666
Why didn’t it work for him, the Elder Wand?

895
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:07,574
Answered another person.

896
01:52:07,575 --> 01:52:11,478
After killing Snape,
he thought the tree would be his.

897
01:52:11,479 --> 01:52:15,643
But the thing is,
the wand had never belonged to Snape.

898
01:52:15,817 --> 01:52:20,311
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the astronomy tower.

899
01:52:20,488 --> 01:52:24,515
Since then,
the tree replied.

900
01:52:25,393 --> 01:52:27,224
Until...

901
01:52:27,395 --> 01:52:31,957
…the other night when I
dragged Draco out of Malfoy Manor.

902
01:52:32,133 --> 01:52:34,260
So that means...

903
01:52:35,803 --> 01:52:37,566
It's mine.

904
01:52:39,707 --> 01:52:40,969
What should we do about it?

905
01:52:41,409 --> 01:52:43,172
We?

906
01:52:43,578 --> 01:52:47,810
I’m just saying, it’s the Elder Wand,
the strongest tree in the world.

907
01:52:47,982 --> 01:52:51,918
With that, we would never be defeated.

908
01:55:15,062 --> 01:55:16,723
Together.

909
01:55:34,048 --> 01:55:36,209
Look out for each other.

910
01:55:55,403 --> 01:55:57,166
- Bag?
- Whether.

911
01:55:57,338 --> 01:55:58,396
Jumper?

912
01:56:00,074 --> 01:56:02,065
I will love you.

913
01:56:03,177 --> 01:56:04,906
Here they come.

914
01:56:20,094 --> 01:56:24,292
Dad, what happens if they put me in Slytherin?

915
01:56:26,567 --> 01:56:29,127
Albus Severus Potter…

916
01:56:30,404 --> 01:56:34,135
… you were named second
students of Hogwarts.

917
01:56:34,308 --> 01:56:35,900
One of them was a Slytherin…

918
01:56:36,077 --> 01:56:39,308
…and he was the bravest
man I know.

919
01:56:41,182 --> 01:56:42,444
But just say I am.

920
01:56:42,617 --> 01:56:48,214
Then Slytherin house will have
she had a beautiful young wizard.

921
01:56:48,389 --> 01:56:54,089
But, listen, if he really means that
especially for you, you can choose Gryffindor.

922
01:56:54,262 --> 01:56:57,197
The Sweepstakes Hat takes
selected in the account.

923
01:56:57,798 --> 01:56:59,823
- Really?
- Really.

924
01:57:01,202 --> 01:57:03,864
- Goodbye, Mom.
- All on board.

925
01:57:04,038 --> 01:57:05,088
Smart?

926
01:57:05,239 --> 01:57:06,797
Smart.

927
01:57:19,053 --> 01:57:20,680
Come on, Jay, stop.

928
01:57:20,855 --> 01:57:22,322
Come on.
