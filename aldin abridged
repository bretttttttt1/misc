 You are late. 
 A thousand apologies, oh patient one. 
 You have it, then? 
 l had to slit a few throats. But l got it. ah ah ah. The treasure. 
 Trust me, my pungent friend. You'll get what's coming to you. 

 At last, after all my years of searching.  The cave of wonders. 
 By Allah. 
 Now, remember. Bring me the lamp. The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine.  
 jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?
 who disturbs my slumber?
 it is i, gazeem. a humble thief.
 Know this. Only one may enter here. One whose worth lies far within.  The diamond in the rough. 
 what are you waiting for. Go on. No! 

 Out of my way, you filthy brats. 
 lf l were as rich as you, l could afford some manners. 
 l'll teach you some manners. 
 lt's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends. 
 You are a worthless street rat. You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat and only your fleas will mourn you. 
 l'm not worthless. And l don't have fleas. 

 l've never been so insulted. 
 Prince Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you? 
 Good luck marrying her off. 
 Jasmine. 

Confound it, Rajah. So this is why Prince Achmed stormed out. 
 Oh, Father. Rajah was just playing with him. Weren't you, Rajah? You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you? 
 Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call. The law says you must be married to a prince by your next birthday. 
 The law is wrong. 
 You've only got three more days. 
 Father, l hate being forced into this. lf l do marry, l want it to be for love. 
 Jasmine, it's not only this law. l'm not going to be around forever, and, l just want to make sure you're taken care of. Provided for. 
 Allah forbid you should have any daughters. 

 l don't know where she gets it from. Her mother wasn't nearly so picky. 
Jafar, my most trusted advisor. l am in desperate need of your wisdom. 
 My life is but to serve you, my lord. 
 lt's this suitor business. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband. l'm at my wits' end. 
 Wits' end. 
 Have a cracker, pretty Polly. 
 Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.  Now, then. Perhaps l can divine a solution to this thorny problem. 
 lf anyone can help, it's you. 
 But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond. 
 My ring? But it's been in the family for years. 
 lt is necessary to find the princess a suitor. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. 
 Everything will be fine. 
 The diamond. 
 Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine. 
 You are most gracious, my liege. Now run along and play with your little toys. 
 That will be pretty good. 
 l can't take it anymore. lf l gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers
 Calm yourself, lago. Soon l will be sultan, not that addle pated twit. 
 And then l stuff the crackers down his throat. 

 With all due respect, Your Rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm? 
 Save your breath, lago. Faster. 
 Yes, oh mighty evil one.

tell him thats very...sweet
(they lean in to kiss)

 Unhand him. By order of the princess. 
 Princess Jasmine. What are you doing here? 
 That's not your concern. Do as l command. Release him. 
 l would, Princess. Except my orders come from Jafar. You'll have to take it up with him. 
 Believe me, l will. 

Jafar? 
Princess. How may l be of service to you? 
The guards took a boy from the market. On your orders. 
Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal. 
What was his crime? 
Why, kidnapping the princess, of course. 
He didn't kidnap me. l ran away. 
Oh, dear. How frightfully upsetting. Had l but known 
What do you mean? 
Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out. 
What sentence? 
Death. By beheading. 
No. 
l am exceedingly sorry, Princess. 
How could you? 

 Help me up. 
Throw me the lamp. 
 l can't hold on. Give me your hand. 
First give me the lamp. 
hahaha. Yes! At last. hahaha
 What are you doing? 
Giving you your reward. Your eternal reward. 
lt's mine. lt's all mine. l- where is it? No. No! 

 Oh, my head.  We’re trapped. That two faced son-of-a-jackal! Whoever he was, he’s long gone with that lamp.

[Genie]
Can your friends do this?
Do your friends do that?
Do your friends pull this out their little hat
Can your friends go poof!


 Jafar, this is an outrage. lf it weren't for all your years of loyal service, From now on, you're to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me. 
Before they are beheaded. 
 l assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again. 
 Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy business behind us. 
 My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, Princess. 
 At least some good will come of my being forced to marry. When l am queen, l will have the power to get rid of you. 
 lf only l had gotten that lamp. 
 ''l will have the power to get rid of you.'' To think we gotta keep kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives. 
 No, lago. Only until she finds a chump husband. Then she'll have us banished. Or beheaded. 
 Wait a minute. What if you were the chump husband? 
 What? 
 You marry the princess, right? And then you become the sultan. 
 Marry the shrew. l become the sultan. The idea has merit. 
i love the way your foul little mind works

 Sire, l have found a solution to the problem with your daughter.  
 Really? 
 Right here. lf the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her. 
 But Jasmine hated all those suitors. How could l choose someone she hates? 
(The sultan absentmindedly pulls the cracker back.  Iago is relieved, but the sultan quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth.) 
 Not to worry, my liege. There is more. lf in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, 
 jerk
 a princess must then be wed to. lnteresting. 
 What? Who? 
 The royal vizier. That would be. me. 
 But l thought only a prince can marry a princess. l'm quite sure. 
 Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord. 
 Desperate measures. 
 You will order the princess to marry me. 
 l will order the princess to...But you're so old. 
 The princess will marry me. 
 The princess will marry

 if were lucky, you wont have to marry jasmine after all.
 i dont trust him sire
 nonsense, jafar, one thing i pride myself on. im an excellent judge of character.
 Jasmine will like this one. 
 And l'm sure l'll like Princess Jasmine. 
 Your Highness, no. l must intercede on Jasmine's behalf. This boy is no different from the others. What makes him think he is worthy of the princess? 
 Your Majesty, l am Prince Ali Ababwa. Just let her meet me. l will win your daughter. 
 How dare you? All of you. Standing around deciding my future? l am not a prize to be won. 
 l think it's time to say goodbye to Prince Abubu.  

 Princess Jasmine?
 Who’s there?
 It’s me, Prince Ali Ababwa. 
 I do not want to see you.
 No, no, please princess. Give me a chance.
 Just leave me alone.  
Down kitty!
 So how’s our little beau doing?
 C'mon, good kitty, take off and go. Down kitty. 
 Wait, wait. Do I know you?
 Uh, no, no.
 You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace.
 The marketplace? I have servants that go to the marketplace for me. Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, 
so it couldn’t have been me you met.
No, I guess not.
Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her! She’s smart, fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything--pick a feature!
Um, Princess Jasmine? You’re very…
Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!
Punctual!
Punctual?
Sorry.
Beautiful.
Nice recovery.
Hmm. I’m rich too, you know.
Yeah!
The daughter of a sultan.
I know.
A fine prize for any prince to marry.
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.
Right, a prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering, peacock I’ve met!
Just go jump off a balcony!
What?
stop her! you want me to sting her?

Goodnight, my handsome prince
sleep well princess.
(They smiled at each other over the railing— until the carpet gave Aladdin a gentle nudge forward. His lips suddenly met hers. She didn't move a bit. 
In the soft light of the stars, they shared a long kiss.)

 Hold him. 
 l'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abubu. Make sure he's never found. 

 Genie, I--uh, I-uh…(He can’t think of how to say it, so they just hug each other.)

 Oh, Father. l just had the most wonderful time. l'm so happy. 
 You should be, Jasmine. l have chosen a husband for you. 
 What? 
 You will wed Jafar. 
 You're speechless, l see. A fine quality in a wife. 
 l will never marry you. Father, l choose Prince Ali. 
 Prince Ali left. 
 Better check your crystal ball again. Tell them the truth, Jafar. You tried to have me killed. 
 What ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness. He's obviously lying. 
 Obviously lying. 
 Father, what's wrong with you? 

 You got a problem, pinky? Jerk. 

 Look at them. Cheering that little pipsqueak. 
 Let them cheer. 
 Tonight the part of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man. 
 l am your master now. Genie, grant me my first wish. l wish to rule on high. As sultan. 

 Jafar, you vile betrayer. 
 That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you. 
 Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that. The lamp. 
 Finders keepers, Abubu. 

 Genie, no! 
 Sorry, kid. l got a new master now. 

 Jafar, l order you to stop. 
 But there's a new order now. My order. Finally you will bow to me. 
 We will never bow to you. 
 lf you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer. Genie, my second wish. l wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world. 
Now, where were we? Ah, yes. Abject humiliation. Down, boy. Oh, Princess. There's someone l'm dying to introduce you to. 

 This is all my fault. l should have freed the genie when l had the chance. l'm sorry, Abu. l made a mess of everything. Somehow.  
iv Got to go back and set things right. 

(The former sultan was now suspended from the ceiling like a marionette. He was dressed in a jester's outfit, and Jafar and lago snickered at the ridiculous sight. 
Jasmine, now dressed in a skimpy red slave outfit, her wrists in shackles, her eyes filled with sadness.
Jafar reached out with his staff. He hooked her shackles and pulled her close.)
(jafar spits on jasmines cheek while speaking. jasmine flicks the spittle off her face with 2 fingers and a haughty look.)

 Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here. Here's your cracker. Shove 'em all the way down your throat. Here, have lots of crackers. 
 Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone. 
 lt pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. 
A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. 
What do you say, my dear? Why, with you as my queen 
 Never. 
 l'll teach you some respect. No. Genie. l have decided to make my final wish. l wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me. 
Don't talk back to me,you big blue lout. You will do what l order you to do, slave. 
 (jasmine says seductively)
jafar. l never realized how incredibly handsome you are. 
 That's better. Now, pussycat, tell me more about myself. 
 You're tall, dark. 
 yes?
 Well dressed. 
 Cute little gaps between your teeth. 
 Go on. 
 And your beard is so. twisted. You've stolen my heart. 
 And the street rat? 
 What street rat? 

(Jafar started to turn. Jasmine had no choice but to pull him close and kiss him—passionately and on the lips.
Now was Aladdin's chance for action. But he couldn't move. All he could do was stare. There she was, the girl for whom he had risked his life, kissing ... him.
Jafar pulled back. He was dazed with joy—until he saw the reflection of Aladdin in Jasmine's crown.)

 That was. You. 
How many times do l have to kill you, boy? 
 Get the lamp. 
 No. 
You deceitful shrew! Princess, your time is up. Don't toy with me. Things are unraveling fast now, boy. Get the point? l'm just getting warmed up. 
are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?
Jasmine, hang on. 
You little fool. You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth. 
Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze him like a
 Without the genie, boy, you're nothing. 
 The genie. The genie has more power than you'll ever have. 
 What!? 
 He gave you your power. He can take it away. Face it, Jafar. You're still just second-best. 
 You're right. His power does exceed my own. But not for long. 
 The boy's crazy. He's a little punch-drunk. 
 Slave, l make my third wish. l wish to be an all-powerful genie. 
 Alright. Your wish is my command.
 Yes. The power. The absolute power. 
 What have you done? 
 Trust me. 
 The universe is mine to command. To control. 
 What? No. 
 Get your blasted beak out of my face. 
 Shut up, you moron. 
 Don't tell me to shut up. 

 Well, I can’t do any more damage around this popsicle stand. I’m outta here! Bye, bye, you two crazy lovebirds. Hey, Rugman ciao! I’m history!
