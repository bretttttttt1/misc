1
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,906
You never did eat
your lunch, did you?

2
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,741
I better get back to the office.

3
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,911
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,371
Why don't you call
your boss and tell him

5
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,790
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,126
Friday anyway, and hot.

7
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,380
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,800
Well, we could laze around
here a while longer.

9
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,429
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.

10
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,975
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in,

11
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,144
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,730
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be
with you in a place like this.

13
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,565
I've heard of married couples
who deliberately spend

14
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,442
an occasional night
in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,487
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,157
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

17
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,160
Oh, Sam, this is the last time.

18
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,661
Yeah? For what?

19
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,037
For this.

20
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,167
For meeting you in secret
SO we can be secretive.

21
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:15,130
You come down here on business
trips, and we steal lunch hours.

22
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,341
I wish you wouldn't even come.

23
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,554
All right. What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

24
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,890
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

25
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,810
I can come down next week.

26
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,061
No.

27
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:35,025
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch, in public?

28
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,404
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

29
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,073
But respectably.

30
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,910
In my house, with my mother's
picture on the mantel

31
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,288
and my sister helping me
broil a big steak for three.

32
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,332
And after the steak,

33
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,168
do we send sister to the movies,
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

34
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,169
Sam!

35
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,757
All right.

36
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,725
Marion, whenever it's
possible, I want to see you.

37
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,103
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

38
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,191
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

39
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,026
Oh, no, I'm all for it.

40
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,530
It requires patience, temperance,
a lot of sweating out.

41
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,950
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

42
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,580
But if I can see you and touch you,
even as simply as this, I won't mind.

43
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,919
I'm tired of sweating for
people who aren't there.

44
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,880
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

45
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,173
I sweat to pay my
ex-wife alimony,

46
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,969
and she's living on the other
side of the world somewhere.

47
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,180
I pay, too.

48
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,184
They also pay who
meet in hotel rooms.

49
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,564
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

50
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,149
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

51
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,151
I haven't even been
married once yet.

52
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,821
Yeah. But when you do,
you'll swing.

53
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,073
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

54
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,332
Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

55
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,586
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

56
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,256
When I send my ex-wife her
alimony, you can lick the stamps.

57
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,174
I'll lick the stamps.

58
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,060
Marion, you want
to cut this off,

59
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,479
go out and find yourself
somebody available?

60
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,273
I'm thinking of it.

61
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,071
How could you even
think a thing like that?

62
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,157
Don't miss your plane.

63
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,617
Hey, we can leave
together, can't we?

64
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,578
I'm late and you have
to put your shoes on.

65
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,802
Is Mr. Lowery back from lunch?

66
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,305
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

67
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:14,184
You know, the oil lease man. That's
why he's late. You got a headache?

68
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,852
It'll pass.

69
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,437
Headaches are like resolutions,

70
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,481
you forget them as soon
as they stop hurting.

71
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,692
Have you got some aspirin? I've
got something, not aspirin.

72
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,403
My mother's doctor gave them
to me the day of my wedding.

73
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:29,199
Teddy was furious when he found
out I'd taken tranquilizers.

74
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,201
Any calls?

75
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,664
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

76
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,541
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying

77
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,293
and she'll be gone the
whole weekend and...

78
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,840
Wow.

79
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,051
It's as hot as fresh milk.

80
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:53,390
Hey, you girls ought to get your
boss to air condition you up.

81
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,975
He can afford it today.

82
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,520
Marion, will you get the copies of
that deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

83
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,646
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,148
Tomorrow's the day,
my sweet little girl.

85
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,652
Oh, not you. My daughter.

86
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,779
A baby.

87
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,493
And tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

88
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,664
I want you to take
a look at my baby.

89
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,419
Eighteen years old

90
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,715
and she never had an unhappy
day in any one of those years.

91
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,759
Come on, Tom. My office
is air conditioned.

92
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,637
Do you know what I
do about unhappiness?

93
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,140
I buy it off.

94
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,517
Are... Are you unhappy?

95
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,979
Not inordinately.

96
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,151
I'm buying this house for
my baby's wedding present.

97
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,654
$40,000 cash.

98
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:56,745
Now that's not buying happiness.
That's just buying off unhappiness.

99
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,333
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

100
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,210
Count them!

101
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,336
I declare!

102
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,131
I don't. That's how
I get to keep it.

103
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:13,094
Tom, a cash transaction of
this size is most irregular.

104
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,139
So what? It's my private money.

105
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,599
Now it's yours.

106
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,017
Suppose we put it in the safe,

107
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,520
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

108
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,856
Oh, speaking of feeling good,

109
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,109
where's that bottle you
said was in your desk?

110
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,194
Uh-oh!

111
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:36,326
You know, sometimes I
can keep my mouth shut.

112
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,125
Lowery, I am dying
of thirst-aroonie.

113
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,381
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

114
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,759
Put it in the safe deposit
box in the bank,

115
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,011
and we'll get him to give us
a check on Monday instead.

116
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,137
Yes.

117
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,269
He was flirting with you.

118
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,147
I guess he must've
noticed my wedding ring.

119
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,162
Come in.

120
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,583
The copies. Mr. Lowery,
if you don't mind,

121
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,293
I'd like to go right
on home after the bank.

122
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,629
I have a slight...
You go right on home.

123
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,923
Because me and your
boss are going out

124
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,425
and get ourselves a little
drinking done. Right?

125
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,261
Of course. Do you feel ill?

126
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,679
Just a headache.

127
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:42,142
What you need is a weekend in Las
Vegas, the playground of the world.

128
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,395
I'm going to spend this weekend in bed.
Thank you.

129
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,860
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

130
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,195
Can't buy off
unhappiness with pills.

131
00:10:55,613 --> 00:11:00,201
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

132
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,702
Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?

133
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,621
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.

134
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,456
What is it, Marion?

135
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,182
Hold it there.

136
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,065
In quite a hurry.

137
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,151
Yes. I didn't intend
to sleep so long.

138
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,196
I almost had an accident
last night from sleepiness,

139
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,448
so I decided to pull over.

140
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,200
You slept here all night?

141
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,787
Yes. As I said, I couldn't
keep my eyes open.

142
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,499
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've...

143
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,251
I mean, just to be safe.

144
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:23,131
I didn't intend to sleep all night. I
just pulled over. Have I broken any laws?

145
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:24,924
No, ma'am.

146
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,384
Then I'm free to go?

147
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,637
Is anything wrong?

148
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,434
Of course not. Am I acting as
if there's something wrong?

149
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,519
Frankly, yes.

150
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,146
Please, I'd like to go.

151
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,606
Well, is there?

152
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,024
Is there what?

153
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,404
I've told you there's
nothing wrong,

154
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,407
except that I'm in a hurry and
you're taking up my time.

155
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,578
Now, just a moment.
Turn your motor off, please.

156
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,165
May I see your license?

157
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,085
Why?

158
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,128
Please.

159
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,798
Be with you in a second!

160
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,739
I'm in no mood for trouble.
What?

161
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,867
There's an old saying. "The first customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

162
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,410
But like I say, I'm
in no mood for it,

163
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,872
so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square
that you won't have one human reason...

164
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,124
Can I trade my car
in and take another?

165
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:31,253
Do anything you have a mind to. Being
a woman, you will. That yours?

166
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,714
Yes, it's... There's
nothing wrong with it.

167
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,175
I just...
Sick of the sight of it.

168
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,510
Why don't you have
a look around here

169
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,136
and see if there's something
that strikes your eyes.

170
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,138
And meanwhile, I'll have my
mechanic give yours the once-over.

171
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,140
You want some coffee? I was just about...
No, thank you.

172
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,518
I'm in a hurry and [ just
wanna make a change.

173
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,103
One thing people
never ought to be

174
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,105
when they're buying used cars
and that's in a hurry.

175
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,776
Like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.

176
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,508
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

177
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,801
How much? Go ahead.

178
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,136
Spin it around the block.

179
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,262
It looks fine.

180
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,305
How much would it
be with my car?

181
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,476
You mean you don't want the usual
day and a half to think it over?

182
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,521
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?

183
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,523
Of course not. Please.

184
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:37,319
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high-pressured the salesman.

185
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,573
I figure roughly

186
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,244
your car plus $700.

187
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,747
$700.

188
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,124
You always got time to
argue money, huh?

189
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,501
All right.

190
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,134
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

191
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,095
I mean, out-of-state license and all.
You got your pink slip...

192
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,057
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?

193
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,726
In the building.

194
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,322
Over there.

195
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,923
I think you better take
it for a trial spin.

196
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,509
I don't want any bad word of
mouth about California Charlie.

197
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,595
I'd really rather not. Can't
we just settle this and...

198
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,139
I might as well be perfectly
honest with you, ma'am.

199
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,683
It's not that I don't
trust you, but...

200
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,101
But what?

201
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,019
Is there anything
so terribly wrong

202
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,064
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

203
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,983
Do you think I've stolen my car?

204
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,150
No, ma'am.

205
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,529
All right, let's go inside.

206
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,859
Hey!

207
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,285
Just put it in here, please.

208
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,706
Thank you.

209
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,883
Heck, Officer,

210
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,134
that was the first time
I ever saw the customer

211
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,386
high-pressure the salesman.

212
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,347
Somebody chasing her?

213
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,475
I better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.

214
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,185
She look
like a wrong one to you?

215
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,103
Acted like one.

216
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,775
The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

217
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,535
Yes, Mr. Lowery.

218
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,121
Caroline, Marion still isn't in?

219
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,667
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

220
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,127
Buzz me the minute she comes in.

221
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,590
And call her sister. No one's
answering at the house.

222
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,134
I called her sister,
Mr. Lowery, where she works,

223
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,136
the Music Makers
Music Store, you know,

224
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,973
and she doesn't know where
Marion is any more than we do.

225
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,140
You better run out to the house.

226
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,810
She may be, well,
unable to answer the phone.

227
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,480
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

228
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,152
No, I haven't the faintest idea.

229
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,114
As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

230
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,784
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.

231
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,870
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.

232
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,748
I did see her some
time later, driving...

233
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,128
I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

234
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,047
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy
for me.

235
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,137
After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!

236
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,015
I'm not taking
the responsibility.

237
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,558
Oh, for heaven's sake.

238
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,602
A girl works for you for
10 years, you trust her.

239
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,938
All right, yes, you
better come over.

240
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,110
Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $40,000!

241
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,114
I'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,
I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!

242
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,657
I'll track her, never
you doubt it.

243
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,117
Hold on, Cassidy.

244
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:40,748
I still can't believe... It must be
some kind of a mystery. I can't...

245
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:44,084
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

246
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:48,130
You still trusting? Hot creepers! She
sat there while I dumped it out!

247
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,593
Hardly even looked at it. Planning.
And even flirting with me!

248
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,866
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't
hear you in all this rain.

249
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,701
Go ahead in, please.

250
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,124
Dirty night.

251
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,876
You have a vacancy?

252
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,838
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
Twelve cabins, 12 vacancies.

253
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,841
They... They moved
away the highway.

254
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,428
Oh, I thought I'd gotten
off the main road.

255
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,764
I knew you must have.

256
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,309
Nobody ever stops here anymore
unless they've done that.

257
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,730
But there's no sense
dwelling on our losses.

258
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:56,068
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

259
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,116
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

260
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,789
Los Angeles.

261
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,632
Cabin One. It's closer in
case you want anything.

262
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,967
Right next to the office.

263
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,095
I want sleep more than anything
else, except maybe food.

264
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:26,807
Well, there's a big diner about 10 miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

265
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,225
Am I that close to Fairvale?

266
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,978
Fifteen miles.
I'll get your bags.

267
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,082
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

268
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,340
Well, the mattress is soft

269
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:05,095
and there's hangers in the closet and
stationery with Bates Motel printed on it

270
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,598
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

271
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,100
And the...

272
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,895
Over there.

273
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,105
The bathroom.

274
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,565
Yeah.

275
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:21,695
Well, if you want anything,
just tap on the wall.

276
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,114
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.

277
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,741
Norman Bates.

278
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,539
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

279
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,999
No.

280
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,002
Well, then would you do me a favor?
Would you have dinner with me?

281
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,462
I was just about to myself.

282
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,964
You know, nothing special,
just sandwiches and milk.

283
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,634
But I'd like it very much if
you'd come up to the house.

284
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,514
I don't set a fancy table, but
the kitchen's awful homey.

285
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,100
- I'd like to.
- All right.

286
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,853
You get yourself settled
and take off your wet shoes,

287
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,646
and I'll be back as
soon as it's ready.

288
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,981
Okay.

289
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,233
With my... With my
trusty umbrella.

290
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,068
No! I tell you no!

291
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,405
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

292
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,908
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion

293
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,202
of young men with cheap,
erotic minds!

294
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,037
Mother, please.

295
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,166
And then what,
after supper? Music? Whispers?

296
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,627
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

297
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,713
"Mother, she's just a stranger.”

298
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,091
As if men don't desire strangers.
As if...

299
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:52,304
I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

300
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,764
You understand, boy? Go on.

301
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,059
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite

302
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,395
with my food or my son!

303
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,024
Or do I have to tell her 'cause
you don't have the guts?

304
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,151
Huh, boy? You have
the guts, boy?

305
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,069
Shut up! Shut up!

306
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,279
I've caused you some trouble.

307
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,656
No.

308
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,117
Mother... My mother...

309
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,703
What is the phrase?

310
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,957
She isn't quite herself today.

311
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:06,753
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

312
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,131
Oh, I'm sorry.

313
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,720
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

314
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,098
Don't worry about it.

315
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,726
But as long as you've fixed a
supper, we may as well eat it.

316
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:36,825
It might be nicer and
warmer in the office.

317
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,966
Well, it stopped raining.

318
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,427
Eating in an office
is just too officious.

319
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,221
I have the parlor back here.

320
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,472
All right.

321
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,114
Sit down.

322
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,907
Thank you.

323
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,871
You're very kind.

324
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,125
It's all for you. I'm not hungry.
Go ahead.

325
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,009
You... You eat like a bird.

326
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,554
And you'd know, of course.

327
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,890
No, not really.

328
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:45,226
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"

329
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,439
is really a false... Falsity.

330
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,151
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

331
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,407
But I don't really know
anything about birds.

332
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,242
My hobby is stuffing things.

333
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,203
You know, taxidermy.

334
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,248
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because

335
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,543
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

336
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,629
You know, foxes and chimps.

337
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,633
Some people even stuff dogs and
cats, but, oh, I can't do that.

338
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,678
I think only birds look
well stuffed because...

339
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:23,098
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

340
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,643
It's a strange hobby. Curious.

341
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,311
Uncommon, too.

342
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,105
Oh, I imagine so.

343
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,109
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
It's cheap, really.

344
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,861
You know, needles
and thread, sawdust.

345
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,656
The chemicals are the only
thing that cost anything.

346
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,825
A man should have a hobby.

347
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,287
Well, it's... It's
more than a hobby.

348
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,793
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

349
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,462
Is your time so empty?

350
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,672
No.

351
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,676
Well, I run the office

352
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,095
and tend the cabins and grounds

353
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,098
and do little errands
for my mother.

354
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,351
The ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

355
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,104
Do you go out with friends?

356
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,068
Well, a boy's best
friend is his mother.

357
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:23,074
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

358
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,078
Only my share.

359
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,580
Where are you going?

360
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,251
I didn't mean to cry.

361
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,378
I'm looking for
a private island.

362
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,549
What are you running away from?

363
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,095
Why do you ask that?
I don't know.

364
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,725
People never run
away from anything.

365
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:55,106
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?

366
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,942
I think that

367
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,614
we're all in our private traps,

368
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,659
clamped in them, and none
of us can ever get out.

369
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,164
We scratch and claw,

370
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,918
but only at the air,
only at each other.

371
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:19,214
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

372
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,718
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

373
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,098
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it anymore.

374
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,976
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

375
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,270
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

376
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,236
You know, if anyone ever
talked to me the way I heard,

377
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,072
the way she spoke to you...

378
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,993
Sometimes when she
talks to me like that,

379
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:54,040
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and leave her forever.

380
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,459
Or at least defy her.

381
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,049
But I know I can't.

382
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,094
She's ill.

383
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,346
She sounded strong.

384
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,140
No, I mean ill.

385
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,063
She had to raise me all by
herself, after my father died.

386
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,900
I was only five and it must've
been quite a strain for her.

387
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,361
I mean, she didn't have to go
to work or anything like that.

388
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,530
He left her a little money.

389
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,993
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

390
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,788
And he talked her
into building this motel.

391
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,082
He could have talked
her into anything.

392
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:40,503
And when he died, too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

393
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,923
And the way he died...

394
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,555
I guess it's nothing to talk
about while you're eating.

395
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:55,059
Anyway, it was just too great a
loss for her. She had nothing left.

396
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,062
Except you.

397
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,650
Well, a son is a poor
substitute for a lover.

398
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,445
Why don't you go away?

399
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,240
To a private island, like you?

400
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,288
No, not like me.

401
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,459
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

402
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,087
She'd be alone up there.

403
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,007
Her fire would go out.

404
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,093
It'd be cold and
damp like a grave.

405
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,472
If you love someone,

406
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,850
you don't do that to them,
even if you hate them.

407
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,312
You understand,
I don't hate her.

408
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,191
I hate what she's become.

409
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,069
I hate the illness.

410
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,114
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her

411
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,493
someplace...

412
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,958
You mean an institution?
A madhouse?

413
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,548
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

414
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,717
Put her in someplace.

415
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:14,180
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
it to sound uncaring.

416
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,600
What do you know about caring?

417
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,895
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

418
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,064
The laughing and the tears

419
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,734
and the cruel eyes studying you.

420
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,444
My mother there?

421
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,532
But she's harmless.

422
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,371
She's as harmless as
one of those stuffed birds.

423
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,999
I am sorry.

424
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,670
I only felt... It seems
she's hurting you.

425
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,923
I meant well.

426
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,633
People always mean well.

427
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,886
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads

428
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,514
and suggest,
oh, so very delicately.

429
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,649
Of course, I've
suggested it myself.

430
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,778
But I hate to even
think about it.

431
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,072
She needs me.

432
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,370
It's not as if she were

433
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,165
a maniac, a raving thing.

434
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,670
She just goes a little
mad sometimes.

435
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,051
We all go a little
mad sometimes.

436
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,221
Haven't you?

437
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,475
Yes.

438
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,479
Sometimes just one
time can be enough.

439
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,648
Thank you.

440
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,860
Thank you, Norman.

441
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,070
Norman.

442
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:57,158
Oh, you're not going back
to your room already?

443
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,118
I'm very tired.

444
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:03,081
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

445
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,874
Really?

446
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,753
I stepped into a
private trap back there

447
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:13,091
and I'd like to go back and
try to pull myself out of it

448
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,469
before it's too
late for me, too.

449
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,305
Are you sure you wouldn't like to
stay just a little while longer?

450
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,265
Just for talk?

451
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,643
Oh, I'd like to, but...

452
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,103
All right.

453
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,731
Well, I'll see you in the morning. I'll
bring you some breakfast, all right?

454
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,108
What time?

455
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,400
Very early. Dawn.

456
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,611
All right, Miss...

457
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,862
Crane.

458
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,072
Crane. That's it.

459
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,490
Good night.

460
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,372
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

461
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,291
Blood! Blood!

462
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,425
I've tried many brands.

463
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:42,013
So far, of those I've used, I haven't
had much luck with any of them.

464
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,474
Let's see what they
say about this one.

465
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,768
They tell you what
its ingredients are

466
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:50,897
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

467
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,067
but they do not tell you
whether or not it's painless.

468
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:57,821
And I say, insect or man, death
should always be painless.

469
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,907
I suppose, this one seems to
claim more and better

470
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,785
qualities than lots
of the others.

471
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,881
Sam?

472
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,884
Sam! Lady wants to see you.

473
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,224
Yes, miss?

474
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:27,684
I'm Marion's sister.

475
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,477
Oh, sure. Lila.

476
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,645
Is Marion here?

477
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,815
- Well, of course not.
- Thank you.

478
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,567
Something wrong?

479
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,655
She left home on Friday.

480
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:44,492
I was in Tucson over the weekend and
I haven't heard from her since.

481
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,494
Not even a phone call.

482
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:50,207
Look, if you two are in this together,
I don't care, it's none of my business,

483
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,334
but I want to talk to Marion
and I want her to tell me

484
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,002
it's none of my business
and then I'll go...

485
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:57,380
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will you?

486
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,424
That's okay, Sam.
I brought it with me.

487
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,426
Run out and eat it.

488
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,059
Now, what thing could
we be in together?

489
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,478
Sorry about the tears.

490
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,940
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

491
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,151
Let's all talk about
Marion, shall we?

492
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,740
Who are you, friend?

493
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,034
My name is Arbogast, friend.

494
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,245
I'm a private investigator.

495
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,497
Where is she, Miss Crane?

496
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,165
I don't know you.

497
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:36,503
Why, I know you don't, because if you
did, I wouldn't be able to follow you.

498
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,755
What's your interest in this?

499
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,800
Well, $40,000.

500
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,512
$40,0007? That's right.

501
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,643
Well, one of you'd better tell me
what's going on, and tell me fast.

502
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:52,769
I can take just so
much of this...

503
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:53,979
Now, take it easy, friend.

504
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:58,525
Take it easy. It's just that
your girlfriend stole $40,000.

505
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,111
What are you talking about?
What is this?

506
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:05,407
She was supposed to bank it on
Friday for her boss and she didn't.

507
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,284
And no one has seen her since.

508
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,994
Someone has seen her.

509
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,163
Someone always sees
a girl with $40,000.

510
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:15,041
Sam, they don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

511
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,293
Sam, if she's here...

512
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,128
She isn't. She isn't.

513
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,838
Miss Crane, can I
ask you a question?

514
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,632
Did you come up here on just
a hunch and nothing more?

515
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,010
Not even a hunch. Just hope.

516
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:28,555
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

517
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,516
I don't care if you
believe me or not.

518
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:34,936
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

519
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,523
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

520
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,525
No, she was seen leaving
town in her own car,

521
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,736
by her employer, I might add.

522
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:45,488
I can't believe it. Can you?

523
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,617
Well, you know, we're always
quickest to doubt people

524
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,370
who have a reputation
for being honest.

525
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,581
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

526
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,875
Where there's a boyfriend...

527
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,294
Well, she's not back there
with the nuts and bolts,

528
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,005
but she's here,
in this town somewhere.

529
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,924
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

530
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,130
- Evening.
- Evening.

531
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,924
I almost drove right past.

532
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,094
I'm always forgetting to turn the
sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

533
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:52,180
Twelve, in fact. Twelve cabins,
twelve vacancies. Candy?

534
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,723
No, thanks.

535
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,935
Last two days, I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

536
01:04:57,018 --> 01:05:00,480
but, you know, this is the first place that
looks like it's hiding from the world.

537
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,483
Well, I'll tell you the truth. I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

538
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,736
Just doesn't seem like any
use anymore, you know.

539
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,615
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

540
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,991
Well, wanna come
in and register?

541
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,576
No, no, sit down.
I don't wanna trouble you.

542
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,286
I just wanna ask
a few questions.

543
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,913
No, that's no trouble.
Today's linen day.

544
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:19,499
I always change the beds here once a
week whether they've been used or not.

545
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,127
Hate the smell of dampness,
don't you? It's such a...

546
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:24,879
I don't know, creepy smell.
Come on.

547
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,216
You out to buy a motel?

548
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,052
No.

549
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,096
Reason I ask, you said
you'd seen so many

550
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:36,307
in the past couple of days,
I thought maybe you...

551
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:38,935
What... What was it
you wanted to ask?

552
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,771
Well, you see, I'm looking
for a missing person.

553
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:45,191
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

554
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,110
I've been trying to trace a girl

555
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:50,905
that's been missing for, oh,
about a week now from Phoenix.

556
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:53,491
It's a private matter. The
family wants to forgive her.

557
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,660
She's not in any trouble.

558
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:59,038
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

559
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,249
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

560
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:03,251
We have reason to believe
that she came along this way.

561
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,628
May have stopped in the area.
Did she stop here?

562
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:08,423
Well, no one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

563
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,717
Would you mind looking at the
picture before committing yourself?

564
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,093
Commit myself?

565
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,845
You sure talk like a policeman.

566
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,097
Look at the picture, please.

567
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,476
Sure? Yeah.

568
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,770
Well, she may have
used an alias.

569
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,439
Marion Crane's her real name,

570
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,567
but she could've registered
under a different one.

571
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:32,322
Well, I tell you, I don't even much
bother with guests registering anymore.

572
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,033
You know, one by one,
you drop the formalities.

573
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,494
I shouldn't even bother
changing the sheets,

574
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,787
but old habits die hard.

575
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:41,581
Which reminds me...

576
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,042
What's that?

577
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,793
It's the light. The sign.

578
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,755
We had a couple last week, said
if the thing hadn't been on,

579
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,007
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

580
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,426
Well, you see, that's
exactly my point.

581
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:55,386
You said that nobody'd been
here for a couple weeks,

582
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:58,223
and there's a couple came by and
didn't know that you were open.

583
01:06:58,306 --> 01:06:59,307
Yeah.

584
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,559
Well, as you say,
old habits die hard.

585
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,521
It's possible, this girl could've
registered under another name.

586
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,439
Do you mind if I
look at your book?

587
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,441
No. Thank you.

588
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:12,695
All right.

589
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,031
I'll get the date somewhere.

590
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:18,159
See, there's nobody.

591
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:21,955
Let's see now, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

592
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,083
Oh, yes.

593
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,502
Here we are.

594
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:30,588
Marie Samuels.
That's an interesting alias.

595
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:32,757
Is that her?

596
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,175
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

597
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:36,302
Marie, Marion.

598
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,972
Samuels. Her boyfriend's
name is Sam.

599
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,017
Was she in disguise,
by any chance?

600
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,437
Wanna check the picture again?

601
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,897
Look, I wasn't lying
to you, Mr...

602
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,066
Oh, I know that. I know
you wouldn't lie.

603
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,026
You know, it's tough keeping
track of the time around here.

604
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,778
Oh, I know, I know.

605
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,239
Oh, yeah.

606
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,491
Well, it was raining

607
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,494
and her hair was all wet.

608
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:04,372
I tell you, it's not really a
very good picture of her either.

609
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,999
No, I guess not.

610
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,458
Tell me all about her.

611
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:08,876
Well,

612
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,631
she arrived rather late one night,
and she went straight to sleep

613
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,467
and left early the next morning.

614
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:17,760
How early?

615
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,512
Oh, very early.

616
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:20,597
Mmm-hmm.

617
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,932
Which morning was that?

618
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,309
The...

619
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,521
The next morning. Sunday.

620
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,481
I see. Mmm-hmm.

621
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,609
Did anyone meet her here? No.

622
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,485
Did she arrive with anyone?

623
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,570
No.

624
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,196
Did she make
any phone calls or...

625
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,323
No.

626
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,574
Locally?

627
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,994
Did you spend the
night with her?

628
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:44,495
No.

629
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:48,458
Well then, how would you know that
she didn't make any phone calls?

630
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,047
Well, she was very tired and...

631
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,467
See, now I'm
starting to remember.

632
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,177
I'm making a mental
picture of it in my mind.

633
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,095
You know, if you make a mental
picturization of something...

634
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,681
That's right. That's right.
Take your time.

635
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:06,225
She was... She was
sitting back there...

636
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:09,228
No, no, she was standing back
there with a sandwich in her hand

637
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,897
and she said she had
to go to sleep early

638
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:16,069
because she had a
long drive ahead of her.

639
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,571
Back where?
Back where she came from.

640
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:21,532
No, you said before that she was sitting
back there... Standing back there...

641
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,077
Yes, back in my parlor there.

642
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,329
She was very hungry
and I made her a sandwich

643
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:31,709
and then she said that she was tired
and she had to go right to bed.

644
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:34,045
I see. How did she pay you?

645
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:35,463
- Cash? Check?
- Cash.

646
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:36,798
Cash, huh?

647
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:40,343
And after she left,
she didn't come back?

648
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,511
Well, why should she?

649
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:42,595
Yeah.

650
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:50,478
Well, Mr. Arbogast, I
guess that's about it.

651
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,690
I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

652
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,817
Well, to tell you
the truth, I do mind.

653
01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:00,071
You see, if it doesn't jell, it isn't
aspic, and this ain't jelling.

654
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,199
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

655
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:07,120
Well, I don't know what you
could expect me to know.

656
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,579
People just come
and go, you know.

657
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,957
That's right. She isn't
still here, is she?

658
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,500
No.

659
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,463
If I wanted to check the
cabins, all 12 of them,

660
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,673
I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

661
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,634
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

662
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:24,387
- Okay?
- Oh. No, thanks.

663
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:43,656
Change your mind?

664
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:51,080
You know, I... l think I must have one of
those faces you just can't help believing.

665
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,915
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

666
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,418
Oh? There's somebody
sitting up in the window.

667
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,502
No, no, there isn't.

668
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:57,712
Sure, go ahead. Take a look.

669
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,797
Oh, that must be my mother.

670
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:02,467
She's an invalid.

671
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,469
It's practically like
living alone.

672
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,012
Oh, I see.

673
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:11,559
Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

674
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,187
No. Not even if she
paid you well?

675
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,354
No.

676
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,441
Let's just say, just for
the sake of argument,

677
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:21,027
that she wanted you to
gallantly protect her.

678
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,987
You'd know that you
were being used.

679
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,447
You wouldn't be made
a fool of, would you?

680
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:26,032
- But I'm not a fool.
- Well, I...

681
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,202
And I'm not capable of being
fooled, not even by a woman.

682
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,453
Well, this is not a slur
on your manhood.

683
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:31,621
Let's put it this way.

684
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:35,541
She might have fooled me, but
she didn't fool my mother.

685
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,585
Well, then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

686
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:40,463
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

687
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:41,714
Yes, but just for a
few minutes. That's all.

688
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,883
There might be some hint
that you missed out on.

689
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,385
You know, sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

690
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:47,804
Mr. Arbogast... l think I've...

691
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,806
Just for a moment.
I wouldn't disturb her.

692
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,516
I think I've talked
to you all I want to.

693
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,975
Yes, but just for...

694
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,895
I think it'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

695
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,231
Well, all right.

696
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:02,193
You sure would save me a lot of leg
work if you'd let me talk to her.

697
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,402
Would I need a warrant
for that, too?

698
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,487
Sure.

699
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,949
All right. Thanks anyway.

700
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:05,339
Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast.
Is Lila there?

701
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,675
Okay. Let me talk
to her, please.

702
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:10,511
Hello, Lila.

703
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:14,140
Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

704
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,768
Yes, she spent last Saturday
night at the Bates Motel.

705
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,604
It's right out here
on the old highway.

706
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:23,274
I even know what cabin she
was in. It was number one.

707
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:28,070
Well, this young fella that runs the place
said that she just spent the night,

708
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,489
left the next day
and that was it.

709
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,744
No, not exactly.

710
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:40,499
Well, I did question him, believe me,
but I think I got all there was to get.

711
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,586
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

712
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:47,548
Well, I tell you, I don't
feel entirely satisfied...

713
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:50,092
See, this boy had
a sick old mother.

714
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:53,095
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

715
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:56,474
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

716
01:13:56,766 --> 01:14:00,478
Well, I was, but I think I'll
go back to the motel first.

717
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:05,191
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

718
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,401
All right, fine. Listen, I...

719
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,904
You'll be happy to
know what I think.

720
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:14,075
I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

721
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,871
Yeah. All right. See you
in about an hour or less.

722
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:19,997
All right, bye-bye.

723
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,847
Bates?

724
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:57,298
Sometimes Saturday night
has a lonely sound.

725
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,466
Ever notice that, Lila?

726
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,137
Sam, he said an hour or less.

727
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:05,014
Yeah.

728
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:08,100
It's been three.

729
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,352
Well, are we just going
to sit here and wait?

730
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:11,896
He'll be back.

731
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:14,773
Let's sit still and
hang on, okay?

732
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,822
How far is the old highway?

733
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,532
You wanna go out there,
don't you?

734
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,326
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady...
- Yes.

735
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,952
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

736
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,579
That wouldn't be a
wise thing to do.

737
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:30,456
Patience doesn't run
in my family, Sam.

738
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,249
I'm going out there.
Look, Arbogast said...

739
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,210
An hour, or less.

740
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:40,424
Well, I'm going.

741
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:42,134
You'll never find it.

742
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,139
Stay here.

743
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:48,390
Why can't I go with you?

744
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:52,186
I don't know. One of us has to be
here, in case he's on the way.

745
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,438
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

746
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,398
Yeah. Stay here.

747
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:18,462
Arbogast?

748
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,173
Arbogast!

749
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:25,803
Arbogast!

750
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,001
He didn't come back here?

751
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,460
Sam!

752
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:02,006
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

753
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:05,009
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door, or unwilling.

754
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:07,052
Where could he have gone?

755
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,388
Maybe he got some definite lead.
Maybe he went right on.

756
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,431
Without calling me?

757
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:11,557
In a hurry.

758
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,727
Sam, he called when he had nothing.
Nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

759
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:18,439
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

760
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,275
Yes, I think he would've.

761
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,359
Let's go see Al Chambers.

762
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,444
Who's he?

763
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:25,154
Our deputy sheriff around here.

764
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,989
All right. Let me get my coat.

765
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,623
Good evening.

766
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:41,295
Well, I don't know where to
start, except at the beginning.

767
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:42,421
Yes.

768
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:44,465
This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.

769
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,425
How do you do?

770
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,761
She's been here searching
for her sister.

771
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,430
There's this private
detective helping and...

772
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:53,557
Well, we got a call
from this detective

773
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,185
saying that he'd traced her to
that motel out on the old highway.

774
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:58,187
That must be the Bates Motel.

775
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,190
He traced her there and called us to say
he was going to question Mrs. Bates.

776
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,733
Norman took a wife?

777
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:06,236
No, I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

778
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:09,656
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.

779
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:13,369
Now, your sister's
missing how long?

780
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:16,538
Well, she left Phoenix a week
ago yesterday, without a trace.

781
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:20,209
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

782
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,419
They thought she'd be
coming to me.

783
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:23,587
Left Phoenix under
her own steam?

784
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:24,838
Yes.

785
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:27,424
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

786
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:28,592
That's right.

787
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:29,885
From what?

788
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,014
She stole some money.

789
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:35,474
A lot?

790
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,727
$40,000.

791
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,979
And the police
haven't been able to...

792
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:44,858
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

793
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:47,486
they could avoid involving
her with the police.

794
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:51,490
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

795
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,951
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

796
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:57,830
Well, he said that Marion was there
for one night and then she left.

797
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,540
With the $40,0007?

798
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,459
Well, he didn't say
anything about the money.

799
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,920
It isn't important what
he said on the phone, is it?

800
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,547
He was supposed to come
back here and talk to us

801
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,715
after he talked to the
mother, and he didn't.

802
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:11,093
That's what I want you
to do something about.

803
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:12,553
Like what?

804
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,222
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

805
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:19,017
It's just that I'm sure there's something
wrong out there and I have to know what.

806
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:22,479
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, miss, but not the same thing.

807
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:25,774
I think what's wrong is
your private detective.

808
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:29,903
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

809
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:32,114
probably from Norman Bates,

810
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:36,368
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

811
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:40,289
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

812
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,666
Why don't you call Norman and
let him say just what happened?

813
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,168
At this hour?

814
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:46,462
Well, he was out when I was
there just a while ago.

815
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,464
If he's back, he probably
isn't even in bed yet.

816
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,257
He wasn't out when
you were there,

817
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:53,510
he just wasn't answering the door in the
dead of night, like some people do.

818
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,929
This fellow lives like a hermit.

819
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:59,183
You must remember that bad business
out there about 10 years ago.

820
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:00,851
Please. Call.

821
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:11,320
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to
connect him with the Bates Motel.

822
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:19,995
Hello, Norman? Sheriff Chambers.

823
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,457
I've been just fine, thanks.

824
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:25,542
Listen, we got worries here.

825
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:29,588
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

826
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:33,217
Well, this one wouldn't be
a customer, anyway.

827
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,468
He's a private
detective, name of...

828
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,261
Arbogast.

829
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:37,804
Arbogast.

830
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:43,393
And after he left?

831
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:48,190
No, that's okay, Norman.

832
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,861
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

833
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:55,822
the detective thanked
him and he went away.

834
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:59,826
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

835
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,246
Your detective told you he
couldn't come right back

836
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:06,250
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

837
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,459
Yes.

838
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,796
Norman Bates' mother has
been dead and buried

839
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,924
in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past 10 years.

840
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:19,304
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

841
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:20,973
It ain't only
local history, Sam.

842
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,851
It's the only case of murder and
suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

843
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:29,439
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with

844
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:31,650
when she found
out he was married.

845
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:34,861
Then took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

846
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:37,864
Strychnine. Ugly way to die.

847
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:41,201
Norman found them dead together.

848
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:42,661
In bed.

849
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:46,915
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in
the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?

850
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:51,253
Now, wait a minute, Sam. Are
you sure you saw an old woman?

851
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,672
Yes! In the house
behind the motel!

852
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:56,133
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

853
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:58,927
You want to tell me you saw
Norman Bates' mother?

854
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:02,306
But it had to be because
Arbogast said so, too!

855
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:05,976
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

856
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,895
Well, if the woman up
there is Mrs. Bates,

857
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:13,483
who's that woman buried out
in Green Lawn Cemetery?

858
01:25:56,902 --> 01:26:00,405
Now, Mother, I'm gonna
bring something up...

859
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,325
I am sorry, boy,

860
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:06,995
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

861
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,622
Please, Mother.

862
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:11,625
No! I will not
hide in the fruit cellar.

863
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:15,337
You think I'm fruity, huh?

864
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,464
I'm staying right here.

865
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:20,425
This is my room and no one
will drag me out of I,

866
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,470
least of all my big, bold son.

867
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:24,721
They'll come now, Mother.

868
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:28,725
He came after the girl, and now
someone will come after him.

869
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,519
Mother, please, it's
just for a few days.

870
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,146
Just for a few days
so they won't find you.

871
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,148
Just for a few days?

872
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,652
In that dark, dank
fruit cellar? No!

873
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:42,656
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

874
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,449
Now get out!

875
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,703
I told you to get out, boy.

876
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,579
I'll carry you, Mother.

877
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:52,624
Norman, what do
you think you're doing?

878
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:56,002
Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!

879
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:04,511
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

880
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:14,271
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

881
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:15,814
Good morning.

882
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:18,316
We thought if you didn't mind, we'd
drive out to that motel with you.

883
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:19,401
He's already been.

884
01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:20,485
Went out before service.

885
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:21,778
Did you two have breakfast?

886
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,238
You didn't find anything?

887
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:26,241
Nothing. Let's clear
the way here.

888
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,453
Well, what did he say
about my sister?

889
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:32,622
Just what he told your
detective, she used a fake name.

890
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:33,999
Saw the register myself.

891
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:37,002
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact.
That boy's alone there.

892
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,420
No mother?

893
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,088
You must have seen
an illusion, Sam.

894
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:43,049
I know you're not the
seeing-illusions type,

895
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:45,510
but no woman was there and
I don't believe in ghosts,

896
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,471
- ...so there it is.
- I still feel that there's something...

897
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:51,308
Can see you do. I'm sorry I
couldn't make you feel better.

898
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:53,101
You want to come around
to my office this afternoon

899
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:56,313
and report a missing person and a
theft, that's what you want to do.

900
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,398
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

901
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:02,319
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister being picked up.

902
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,904
How about that?

903
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:05,614
I don't know.

904
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:06,907
It's Sunday.

905
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:10,160
Come on over to the house and do
your reporting around dinnertime.

906
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:11,995
It'll make it nicer.

907
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:13,872
You too, Sam.

908
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,081
Thank you.

909
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,503
Maybe I am the
seeing-illusions type.

910
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,213
No, you're not.

911
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,132
Well, you want me to
drop you at the hotel or...

912
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:25,217
Sam.

913
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,512
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

914
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,848
Neither will I. Come on.

915
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:37,437
We better decide what we're gonna
say or do when we walk in there.

916
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:39,648
We're going to register
as man and wife.

917
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,442
We're going to get
shown to a cabin,

918
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:46,738
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

919
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,430
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

920
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:15,058
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

921
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:16,434
Come on.

922
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:20,438
Well?

923
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:21,690
Just coming up to ring for you.

924
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:22,774
Uh-huh.

925
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,442
Suppose you want a room.

926
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,319
We were gonna try to make it
straight to San Francisco,

927
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,405
but we don't like
the look of that sky.

928
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:29,906
Looks like a bad day
coming, doesn't it?

929
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:31,533
Okay.

930
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:39,541
I'll take you to Cabin 10.

931
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,042
Better sign in first, hadn't we?

932
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,044
No. That's not necessary.

933
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:47,173
My boss is paying for this trip
and, well, it's 90% business.

934
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:49,968
He wants practically
notarized receipts.

935
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,596
I'd better sign in
and get a receipt.

936
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:11,656
Thank you.

937
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:17,996
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

938
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,833
I'll show you the room, then.

939
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,627
First time I've ever
seen it happen.

940
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:25,712
You check in any other place
in this country without bags

941
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:27,839
and you have to pay in advance.

942
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:29,215
$10.

943
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,308
That receipt.

944
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:45,857
I'll go on ahead.

945
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:54,532
All right, there's your receipt.
Now, I'll show you the cabin.

946
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:57,410
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

947
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,889
Sam, we have to go into
that cabin and search it,

948
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:21,434
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

949
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:22,686
I know.

950
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:25,146
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

951
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:26,564
I don't know.

952
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:29,442
But if you had a useless
business like this motel,

953
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:30,694
what would you need to get out?

954
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,862
To get a new business
somewhere else?

955
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:34,406
$40,0007?

956
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:39,202
How could we prove that...

957
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:41,788
Well, if he opens a motel on the
new highway in, say, a year...

958
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:44,457
There must be some
proof that exists now,

959
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:48,044
something that proves he got that
money away from Marion somehow.

960
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:49,546
What makes you sound so certain?

961
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:51,673
Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

962
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:56,386
Or he felt sorry for me and he was
beginning to feel the same way about you.

963
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:59,139
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

964
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,432
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

965
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:03,351
or done anything without telling
us, unless he was stopped.

966
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:07,230
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

967
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:11,443
We'll start with Cabin One.

968
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:16,948
If he sees us, we're
just taking the air.

969
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,148
Bates.

970
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:42,867
No shower curtain. Sam!

971
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,119
Look! What is it?

972
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,454
It's figuring. It didn't
get washed down. Look.

973
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:50,458
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

974
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,668
That proves Marion was here.

975
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,086
It'd be too wild
a coincidence...

976
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:55,171
Bates never denied she was here.

977
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:58,258
Well, doesn't that prove that
he found out about the money?

978
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,926
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

979
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:01,052
No.

980
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:04,514
But that old woman, whoever she
is, she told Arbogast something.

981
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:07,433
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

982
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:08,893
You can't go up there.

983
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:10,436
Why not?

984
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:12,438
Bates. Well, let's find him.

985
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,358
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

986
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:18,444
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

987
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:20,321
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

988
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:23,449
I can handle a sick old woman.

989
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:27,120
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

990
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:29,247
Wait a minute.

991
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:32,417
If you get anything
out of the mother,

992
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:35,378
can you find your
way back to town?

993
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,921
Yes, of course.

994
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:40,884
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

995
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,408
You looking for me?

996
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,993
Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

997
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:08,661
Wife's taking a nap

998
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:10,997
and I never can keep quiet
enough for her,

999
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,707
so I just thought I'd
look you up and talk.

1000
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:15,043
Good. You satisfied
with your cabin?

1001
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:16,669
Oh, it's fine.

1002
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,413
I've been doing all the
talking so far, haven't 1?

1003
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,581
I thought it was the people who
were alone most of the time

1004
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:38,001
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

1005
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:40,295
Here you are doing
all the listening.

1006
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:42,588
You are alone here, aren't you?
Mmm-hmm.

1007
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:44,424
Drive me crazy.

1008
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:48,428
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

1009
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:50,054
Just an expression.

1010
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:53,516
What I meant was I'd do just
about anything to get away.

1011
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:55,435
Wouldn't you? No.

1012
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:02,942
Mrs. Bates?

1013
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:22,397
I'm not saying you shouldn't
be contented here,

1014
01:38:22,397 --> 01:38:24,399
I'm just doubting that you are.

1015
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:28,111
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under, you'd unload this place.

1016
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:31,406
This place? This place
happens to be my only world.

1017
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:35,910
I grew up in that house up there.
I had a very happy childhood.

1018
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:37,537
My mother and I were
more than happy.

1019
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:42,018
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

1020
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:43,519
I don't know what
you've been saying.

1021
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:46,939
I've been talking about your
mother, about your motel.

1022
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:48,107
How you gonna do it?

1023
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:49,358
Do what?

1024
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,361
Buy a new one in a new town where
you won't have to hide your mother.

1025
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:55,156
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here, okay?

1026
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,200
Where will you get
the money to do that, Bates?

1027
01:39:57,283 --> 01:39:59,243
Or do you already
have it socked away?

1028
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:00,328
Shut up!

1029
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:02,163
A lot of it. $40,000.

1030
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:09,378
I bet your mother knows where the
money is and what you did to get it.

1031
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:11,380
I think she'll tell us.

1032
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:16,719
Where's that girl you came
here with? Where is she?

1033
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:23,327
Mrs. Bates...

1034
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:45,182
I'm Norma Bates!

1035
01:42:16,422 --> 01:42:19,508
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

1036
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:22,428
Even I couldn't get to
Norman and he knows me.

1037
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:24,639
You warm enough, miss? Yes.

1038
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,475
Did he talk to you?

1039
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:29,477
No.

1040
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:36,609
I got the whole story, but not from Norman.
I got it from his mother.

1041
01:42:37,902 --> 01:42:40,404
Norman Bates no longer exists.

1042
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:44,075
He only half-existed
to begin with.

1043
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:47,036
And now the other
half has taken over,

1044
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:50,539
probably for all time.

1045
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:54,460
Did he kill my sister?

1046
01:42:54,543 --> 01:42:56,420
Yes.

1047
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:57,588
And no.

1048
01:42:58,255 --> 01:43:01,425
Well, now look, if you're trying
to lay some psychiatric groundwork

1049
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:03,594
for some sort of plea, this
fellow would like to cop...

1050
01:43:03,678 --> 01:43:06,514
A psychiatrist doesn't
lay the groundwork.

1051
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,016
He merely tries to explain it.

1052
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:11,811
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

1053
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:16,857
Yes, I'm sorry.

1054
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,568
The private investigator, too.

1055
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:24,323
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

1056
01:43:27,743 --> 01:43:30,913
Have you any unsolved missing
persons cases on your books?

1057
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:32,415
Yes, two.

1058
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:33,708
Young girls?

1059
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:35,418
Did he confess to...

1060
01:43:35,418 --> 01:43:37,420
Like I said, the mother.

1061
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:44,093
Now, to understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the mother,

1062
01:43:44,427 --> 01:43:47,638
that is, from the mother
half of Norman's mind,

1063
01:43:48,389 --> 01:43:50,683
you have to go back 10 years

1064
01:43:51,267 --> 01:43:54,478
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

1065
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:57,064
Now, he was already
dangerously disturbed,

1066
01:43:57,148 --> 01:43:59,400
had been ever
since his father died.

1067
01:44:00,443 --> 01:44:04,196
His mother was a clinging,
demanding woman,

1068
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:10,411
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

1069
01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:12,455
Then she met a man,

1070
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:17,001
and it seemed to Norman that she
threw him over for this man.

1071
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:21,422
Now, that pushed him over the
line and he killed them both.

1072
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:25,801
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

1073
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:30,347
most unbearable to
the son who commits it.

1074
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:35,978
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

1075
01:44:39,023 --> 01:44:40,775
He stole her corpse.

1076
01:44:43,402 --> 01:44:45,613
A weighted coffin was buried.

1077
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:49,074
He hid the body
in the fruit cellar,

1078
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:52,411
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

1079
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:54,622
And that still wasn't enough.

1080
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:59,168
She was there,
but she was a corpse.

1081
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:04,423
So he began to think
and speak for her,

1082
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:07,134
give her half his life,
so to speak.

1083
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:11,639
At times he could be both
personalities, carry on conversations.

1084
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:16,393
At other times, the mother
half took over completely.

1085
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:21,482
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only Mother,

1086
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:26,403
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her,

1087
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:29,406
he assumed that she was
as jealous of him.

1088
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:33,953
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

1089
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:37,623
the mother side of
him would go wild.

1090
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,003
When he met your sister,

1091
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,590
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

1092
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:48,300
He wanted her.

1093
01:45:50,386 --> 01:45:54,390
That set off the jealous mother,
and Mother killed the girl.

1094
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:59,728
After the murder, Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep,

1095
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:04,400
and, like a dutiful son, covered
up all traces of the crime

1096
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,027
he was convinced
his mother had committed!

1097
01:46:07,111 --> 01:46:09,405
Why was he dressed like that?

1098
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,740
He's a transvestite.

1099
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,285
Not exactly.

1100
01:46:14,827 --> 01:46:18,414
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change

1101
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:20,875
or satisfaction is
a transvestite.

1102
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:25,379
But in Norman's case, he was
simply doing everything possible

1103
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:29,049
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

1104
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:32,887
And when reality came too close,

1105
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:36,432
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

1106
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:42,021
he'd dress up, even to
a cheap wig he bought.

1107
01:46:42,104 --> 01:46:46,233
He'd walk about the house, sit in
her chair, speak in her voice.

1108
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:48,402
He tried to be his mother.

1109
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:53,073
And now he is.

1110
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:58,329
That's what I meant when I said I
got the story from the mother.

1111
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:01,457
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities,

1112
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:04,710
there's always a
conflict, a battle.

1113
01:47:05,711 --> 01:47:08,464
In Norman's case,
the battle is over,

1114
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:11,800
and the dominant
personality has won.

1115
01:47:11,884 --> 01:47:14,637
And the $40,000? Who got that?

1116
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:19,475
The swamp. These were crimes
of passion, not profit.

1117
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:25,439
He feels a little chill. Can
I bring him this blanket?

1118
01:47:25,522 --> 01:47:27,483
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

1119
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:41,956
Thank you.

1120
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:52,257
It's sad when a
mother has to speak the words

1121
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:54,385
that condemn her own son,

1122
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:58,263
but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.

1123
01:47:58,347 --> 01:48:02,142
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

1124
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,979
He was always bad,

1125
01:48:05,062 --> 01:48:10,109
and in the end he intended to tell them
I killed those girls and that man,

1126
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:13,904
as if I could do anything
except just sit and stare,

1127
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:16,407
like one of his stuffed birds.

1128
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:20,619
They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

1129
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:26,375
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

1130
01:48:29,378 --> 01:48:32,548
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

1131
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:36,051
Let them see what kind
of a person I am.

1132
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:39,638
I'm not even gonna
swat that fly.

1133
01:48:39,722 --> 01:48:42,391
I hope they are watching.
They'll see.

1134
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:44,643
They'll see and they'll know,

1135
01:48:44,727 --> 01:48:49,398
and they'll say, "Why, she
wouldn't even harm a fly."
