1
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,516
do not worry. It's just a pack of wolves.
Come on, it'll be over soon.

2
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,832
- Caleb, they're chasing me!
- Grab it!

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,251
Run! Run!

4
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,667
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.

5
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,211
Come on, help me fill it.

6
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,515
What if someone digs it up?

7
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,556
May God have mercy on his soul.

8
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,715
- Hello Alan.
- Hello Mr. Magruder.

9
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,431
- Afternoon, Alan.
- Hi Frank.

10
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,066
- It's all yours, Alan.
-Thank you, Bill.

11
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,915
Catch him!

12
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,716
Prepare to die, Parrish!

13
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,765
Hey Parish, what's the hurry?

14
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,440
I'm going to my father's factory!

15
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,363
He is going to visit his father now.

16
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,787
Come on Parish! Run to Daddy.

17
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,045
We'll be expecting you.

18
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,938
Hi Karl.

19
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,776
Hi Alan, my man. I have to do it
show me something come here.

20
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,191
Okay, I've been working on this
for almost a year.

21
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,655
and made a reservation
with my dad...

22
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,072
...to show him this.
Please accept it.

23
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,167
So what do you think?
do you think he will like it?

24
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,582
what is that?

25
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:09,171
what is that? This is the future. if you can get
Worn by Wilt Chamberlain...

26
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,711
...there are a pair of them
In every closet across America.

27
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,926
It will be the pinnacle of fashion.

28
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,051
what happened?

29
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,934
- there is nothing.
- Alan!

30
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,520
Thank you Bob. what are you doing here

31
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,903
I told you, this factory is not
playground. It's dangerous.

32
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,696
Dad, can I drive you home?

33
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,406
Oh Alan.

34
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,444
Is Billy Jessup Bullying You Again?

35
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,282
son you have it
You will face him sooner or later.

36
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:46,253
See, if you're afraid of something,
you have to stand up and face it.

37
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,879
Run now, son.

38
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,422
Karl, you know better
Rather than let the boy play here.

39
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,257
I am sorry.

40
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,881
oh what was it
did you want to show me

41
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,890
wait a minute.

42
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,018
What kind of devil—?

43
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,234
Get a fire extinguisher.
bring it over here

44
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,032
what is that?

45
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,497
who did it?

46
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,706
good?

47
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,003
I did it, sir.

48
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,480
Being a parish doesn't mean
I can hang out with my girlfriend.

49
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,444
we are just friends.

50
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,108
No more.

51
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,361
Catch him!

52
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,154
- Alright, let's go.
- OK, I brought his bike!

53
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,120
Jerky!

54
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,459
decent.

55
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,971
Alan?

56
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,595
stay at home

57
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:20,311
Oh, Alan, no more. come.

58
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,198
diligence, determination,
Bright prospects...

59
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,826
...attributes you exemplified
The spirit of Brantford...

60
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,740
...since our ancestors
first settled in this town.

61
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:37,161
Despite the harsh climate of our homeland,
And granite in our soil...

62
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,954
...we have...

63
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,170
- prospered.
- I found out everything this morning.

64
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,460
All will be known tonight.

65
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,676
- right. Alright, let's go.
-Sam, I have to talk to Alan.

66
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,856
Well, we're off.

67
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,140
Understood.

68
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,528
i told your dad that you told me this
In the afternoon, I thought it wasn't just Billy Jessup.

69
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,987
- See, if I had known that, I wouldn't have done that--
- It's okay, Dad.

70
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,117
But I am proud of you.

71
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,079
you face them
Even if they were outnumbered.

72
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:18,039
And because you took it manly,
Your mother and I have decided...

73
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,375
...are ready
to Cliffside Boys' School.

74
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,041
- There.
- Congratulations, sweetheart.

75
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,757
You don't want me to live here anymore?

76
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,388
Alan.

77
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,718
that was always the plan
to go to Cliffside.

78
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,104
That is, the parish has gone
It's been in Cliffside since the 1700's.

79
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,265
Uncle Skyler also went there.

80
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,150
Look at this. Parish Hall?

81
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,902
This is the main dormitory.

82
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,445
This is fantastic. Here the children are involved in my case
Because I'm parish

83
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,114
wait till i live
In a building named after me.

84
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,625
Named after his father.

85
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,081
good. why don't you live there?

86
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:05,249
Hooray. I wouldn't be here now
If only I hadn't spent years there.

87
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,635
Maybe I don't want to be you.

88
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,636
maybe i don't want to
to be parish.

89
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,930
It won't.
Until you start acting like that.

90
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,140
- Sam--
-Put on your coat.

91
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,776
So I guess I'm not ready for Cliffside.

92
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,565
I'll take you next Sunday!
And I don't want to hear anything anymore!

93
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,948
It won't!

94
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,986
I will never speak to you again!

95
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,326
- Sam...
-stop it.

96
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,836
- Sam.
-what?

97
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,292
there is nothing. just -

98
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,403
what are you doing here

99
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,989
I brought your bicycle home.

100
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,825
It didn't need to.

101
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,081
i was going on
I went to Billy's to pick it up myself.

102
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,334
I told Billy to stop bullying you.

103
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:28,044
I shouldn't have wasted my breath.
We must talk about this on another occasion.

104
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,341
What?

105
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,012
- Did you hear that too?
-Of course I did.

106
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,510
come. I found
This really weird game made in a factory.

107
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,519
game?

108
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,533
"Jumanji.

109
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:04,209
A game for those who seek
How to leave their world behind.

110
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,004
Roll the dice to move the tokens.
Doubles get more turns.

111
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,211
The first player to reach the end wins. "
do you want to play?

112
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,053
I quit board games
5 years ago.

113
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,220
Sara!

114
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,399
It must be magnetic or something.

115
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,813
Alan, look.

116
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,653
"They fly away at night, so you'd better run away.

117
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:40,237
These winged things aren't very fun. "

118
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,748
What?

119
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,087
I don't know.

120
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,083
- Put that aside, Alan.
-Understood.

121
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,849
Oh my god

122
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,601
The game thinks I rolled.

123
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,763
What does "the game thinks" mean?

124
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,772
"In the jungle you have to wait...

125
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,234
...until the die rolls a 5 or an 8. "

126
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,660
"In the jungle you have to wait"?
What does that mean?

127
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,549
Sara!

128
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,215
Roll the dice!

129
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,180
Sara!

130
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,007
I think bed and breakfast is free
what this city needs.

131
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,928
Well, it was pretty hard to give up.
Especially the furniture is substantial.

132
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,311
oh boy.

133
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,098
i keep forgetting
how big this place is.

134
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,814
Judy, Peter, come see this.

135
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,025
set up a reception area
here.

136
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,524
And the parlor here has a bar.

137
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,159
That's nice.

138
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,074
Surely you and your children
You will be very happy here.

139
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,039
good...

140
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,704
In fact, they belonged to my late brother.

141
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,715
he and his wife died
just last winter.

142
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,554
what is this?

143
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,890
It is certainly so.

144
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,075
So what do you think, young man?
Is it big enough for you?

145
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,132
peter didn't say a word
since it happened.

146
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,627
Oh, I see.

147
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,922
sorry. How awful!

148
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,345
Are you okay.

149
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,141
We hardly even knew our parents.
they were always apart.

150
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,523
skiing in st moritz,
Gambling in Monte Carlo...

151
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,356
...a safari in the darkest of Africa.

152
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,443
We didn't even know if they loved us.

153
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,029
But when the chieftain's yacht sank...

154
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,945
...they managed to write us a letter
A beautiful farewell letter...

155
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,241
...it was found floating
A champagne bottle in the rubble.

156
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,208
sorry.

157
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,971
They were very dedicated parents.
It was a car accident in Canada.

158
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,303
- So, can you send me the escrow documents?
- Starting tomorrow.

159
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,085
I need to get it from a locksmith
About this.

160
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,175
Peter, pick up your toys.

161
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,897
Peter, please take this suitcase up to the attic.

162
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,776
Let's all eat ice cream then.
and bourbon.

163
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,800
what? what is that?

164
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,387
Go to Motel 6.

165
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,768
Oh, just in case.

166
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,338
I don't see any guano.

167
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,010
He said it looks like it.

168
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:35,092
It's an African bat. some kid said
She saw something in the 60's...

169
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,603
...but no bats
like New England.

170
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,933
that's what he saw.

171
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,442
Well, whatever it is, it's gone now.

172
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,318
I'm not worried about bats
in this house anyway.

173
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,107
what are you worried about?

174
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,071
Well, personally...

175
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,864
...don't want to live in the house
where someone was killed.

176
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,291
- killed?
-yes.

177
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,498
Little Alan Parrish.
He says his father did it.

178
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:09,084
There are 1001 places where he could have hidden
bodies in this house.

179
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,341
Especially if he chopped it up first.

180
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,547
Hey there!

181
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,059
you don't want to be late
on the first day of school.

182
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,523
- You can't see bats, ma'am.
-Do you hear that?

183
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,653
nothing to fear
in this house.

184
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,178
i can't believe i have to see
Principal after the first day.

185
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,933
what are you gonna do

186
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,438
let's relax
and finish dinner.

187
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,020
talk about other things.

188
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,523
I see why you got
This house is very cheap.

189
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,815
26 years ago the boy named
Alan Parrish once lived here.

190
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,443
And then one day he suddenly disappeared.

191
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,537
because his parents chopped him up
I shredded it into pieces and hid it in the wall.

192
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,542
Yes, that's all. sick and tired
About your lies, miss. you are grounded

193
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,633
All right, there's nowhere to go
In this stupid city anyway.

194
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,762
However, for reference,
It wasn't a lie.

195
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,462
Did you hear anything earlier?

196
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,173
Do you miss your father and mother?

197
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,226
no.

198
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,761
liar.

199
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,432
if you don't cut it
They send you to shrink.

200
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,274
where do you think they are going
If you don't start talking, will you send it?

201
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,915
I will call you when I am stopped at the permit station.

202
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,630
the school bus should be here
Even now.

203
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,305
Do you still have your house key?

204
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,384
Are you listening to me?

205
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,265
Hello?

206
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:09,980
Hello?

207
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,391
what?

208
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,523
Maybe I'd better wait with you
until the bus comes.

209
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,860
did your parents use
to get you on the bus

210
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,199
no no

211
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,031
Are you serious?

212
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,162
I can drop you off

213
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,246
No, don't worry about us.
The bus will arrive soon.

214
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,250
Understood. I hope you are doing well today.

215
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,174
Sounds good, doesn't it?

216
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,516
what are you listening to?

217
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,534
Where are you from?

218
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,852
Let's bring it over here.

219
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,250
strange. they are stuck.

220
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,337
"Jumanji, a game for people like that"
someone trying to find...

221
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,463
...how to leave their world behind.

222
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,341
Roll the dice to move the tokens.
Doubles get more turns.

223
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,594
The first player to reach the end wins. "

224
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,769
It could be a microchip or something.

225
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,603
Go ahead.

226
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,568
Understood.

227
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,357
six.

228
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,632
"A slight bite may cause itching,
Sneeze or have convulsions. "

229
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,917
stop it!

230
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,504
"This will not be an easy task.

231
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,264
The monkey slows down the expedition. "

232
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,349
what is that?

233
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,063
That monkey must have come
from the game.

234
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,224
Mosquitoes too.

235
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,900
I didn't see this part.

236
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,156
“Adventurers, be careful.”

237
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:43,421
"Adventurer, be careful. Don't start."
Unless you intend to end it.

238
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,673
exciting results
Game's...

239
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:49,426
...will only disappear if the player is holding it.
Reached Jumanji and called its name. "

240
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,758
- The monkey is gone.
-good.

241
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,922
- Put it away.
-hang on!

242
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,592
When you finish the game, everything is gone.

243
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,056
you better do it
Otherwise, Aunt Nora will have a seizure.

244
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,474
You should get over it quickly.
So skill doesn't matter.

245
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,361
No, I played doubles.

246
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,237
There will be another turn.

247
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,943
roll.

248
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,279
five.

249
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:20,833
"His fangs are sharp.
he likes your taste

250
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:25,337
Your party should move quickly. "

251
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,048
i don't like that sound

252
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,010
Judy, someone's here.

253
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,653
It's not real, Peter. it's a hallucination.

254
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,495
Run, Peter!

255
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,006
i'm back.

256
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,018
my bike.

257
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,650
Will someone roll a 5 or an 8?

258
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,903
he did

259
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,906

thank you.

262
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,129
I'm sorry if I scared you.
I'm sorry if I scared you.

263
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,334
thank you.

264
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,999
i'm back!

265
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,509

266
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,839

271
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,229
no.

272
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,194
I'm Judy and he's Peter.

273
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,859
where's mama Is your father at the factory?

274
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,574
you...

275
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,701
...Alan Parrish?

276
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,868
Yeah. Who are you?

277
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,877
we live here now

278
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,043
where are my mom and dad?

279
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,041
I do not understand.

280
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,299
This house has been vacant for many years.

281
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,302
Everyone thought you were dead.

282
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,647
sorry.

283
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,069
――It is said that he is about two feet tall.
Red fur, long tail.

284
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,985
- Please tell me that explanation again.
- Red fur and long tail.

285
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:22,092
get out of my car,
and step onto the footpath.

286
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,093
- What year was that?
-It was brand new.

287
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:32,512
- No, how old are you?
-1995, remember?

288
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,645
- 95...
- Do you have ID?

289
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,933
let me guess,
It's on your other Tarzan costumes, right?

290
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,943
- It's been 26 years.
-Are you from around here?

291
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,649
I was.

292
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,314
But I was in Jumanji.

293
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,200
Indonesia. He was in the Peace Corps.

294
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,753
- Carl Bentley, the only man.
-Is this guy related to you?

295
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,791
- Yes, sir, he is our uncle.
- Is he always dressed like that?

296
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,801
Well, he's a vegetarian.

297
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,011
Get out of here!

298
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,638
monkey. monkey.

299
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,311
Is he okay upstairs?

300
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,524
he injured his head
A few months ago.

301
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,996
Don't move!

302
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,578
thief! Hey!

303
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,667
- stop! stop!
- Don't move, don't move.

304
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,173
Hey wait a minute!
where are you going?

305
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,755
To find my parents!

306
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,425
come.

307
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,619
hang on!

308
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,927
My father used to make shoes here.

309
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,514
these were the best shoes
in New England.

310
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,182
Hey!

311
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,114
sorry.

312
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,111
Easy girl.

313
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,785
do you know what happened
To a shoe factory?

314
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:48,332
Yes it was folded.
Like everything else in this town.

315
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,169
It's pretty cold outside.
Would you like some coffee?

316
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,514
Why would they close Parish Shoes?

317
00:36:56,256 --> 00:37:00,727
When the child ran away, Sam said,
all he had to find him.

318
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,853
his time, his money...

319
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,514
all.

320
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,151
After a while he stopped coming to work.

321
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,520
He just stopped caring.

322
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:15,905
I don't think anyone loved his son
more than Sam.

323
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,946
here.

324
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,534
You will freeze there.

325
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,839
thank you.
Do parrish still exist?

326
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,835
- I see them sometimes.
-Yeah?

327
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,595
They are across Adams Street.

328
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,820
Our parents are also dead.

329
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,455
they were in the middle east
When negotiating peace--

330
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,252
Our father was in the advertising industry.

331
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,218
I'm sure you miss him, right?

332
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,387
me too.

333
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,643
There he goes again.

334
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:29,604
Listen, I know you're upset,
But we should finish the game.

335
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,985
we? why do you need me

336
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,113
well, just in case
There are other scary things.

337
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,899
Besides, there's a lion in my aunt's bedroom.

338
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,909
Do I look like the Ringling brothers?

339
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,699
She will be home soon.

340
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,582
wouldn't she be surprised?
I hope she's not allergic to cats.

341
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,508
Larry, I need wheels.
give me a hand

342
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,643
- Did we hit her so hard?
- No, it looks like a strange bite again.

343
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:19,825
- Yes, one more, okay.
-Hey, you're over 50. What the hell is going on?

344
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,867
- it's simple. easy.
- Hey, look.

345
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,120
- Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
-who is that?

346
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,407
- Realtors.
-quiet.

347
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,995
listen.

348
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,746
Can you hear me?

349
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,627
what are you listening to?

350
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,796
Let's get in the car.

351
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:43,382
Well, let's think. what came out
What about the game in front of you?

352
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,927
there was a lion,
A group of monkeys and...

353
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,595
that!

354
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:55,228
okay, okay
It's just a bug, but you're safe here.

355
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,145
look? we are fine

356
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,198
as long as we stay low
He can't go very far there, okay?

357
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,908
please do not worry. we are fine

358
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,199
Understood. He can't let us in here.
He cannot pass through glass.

359
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,535
we are safe

360
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,373
Do any of you know how to drive?

361
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,504
no? Well, that's fine.

362
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,879
my father used to let me
Get the car back on the driveway.

363
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,592
one time.

364
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,348
So what matters?

365
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,179
- Fasten your seat belt.
-Let's go!

366
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,349
wait a minute. what? hang on.

367
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,443
Alan, top!

368
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,671
piece of cake.

369
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,882
Yeah.

370
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,436
Alan.

371
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,985
Keep those things away from me!

372
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,239
When will you help us play?

373
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,121
We must hurry.
Our aunt will be coming home soon.

374
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:34,455
well good let her girlfriend know
That she is the former owner of this house.

375
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:39,589
I hope you realize that now that my parents are gone,
This house belongs to me.

376
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,840
Oh, thank you.

377
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,756
No more banana leaves.

378
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,969
yes.

379
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:58,353
What do you think of those monkeys?
Are you going to do something for the ecosystem?

380
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,728
Hello?

381
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,554
what happened?
Shave with glass?

382
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,099
what happened?
Do the Clampetts have a yard sale?

383
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,809
what do you want?
I have never shaved before.

384
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:43,816
where are you going?

385
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:48,905
How about playing with Peter and I?
So are you just watching?

386
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,489
thank you i saw

387
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,660
So if you don't help us
what about you

388
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,292
I don't know.
Continue almost where you left off.

389
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,500
Mrs. Niedermeier's?
I am still teaching 6th grade.

390
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,846
Come on, Judy, he's not going to help us.
He's scared

391
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,765
what did you say?

392
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,853
Scary, isn't it? It's okay to be scared.

393
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,855
Let's set it up in the living room.

394
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,702
you don't know anything
what you are obsessed with.

395
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,205
whatever it is, we'll handle it
by ourselves. I don't need your help.

396
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,038
i don't think so.

397
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,625
do you think you are a monkey
Are mosquitoes and lions bad guys?

398
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,756
It's just the beginning.

399
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,174
I've seen what only you have seen
in your nightmares.

400
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,219
something you can't even imagine.

401
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,434
invisible.

402
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,764
there is something
It hunts you at night.

403
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:05,231
Then something screams.
Then I hear them eating.

404
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,943
and you want God
That you are not a dessert.

405
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,649
I am afraid?

406
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,945
You don't even know what you're afraid of

407
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:18,081
You won't last five minutes without me.

408
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,366
So - -...

409
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,998
...can you help us?

410
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,294
watch...

411
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,463
...but don't be afraid.

412
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,359
Peter, it was so cool.

413
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,943
Reverse psychology, isn't it?
My father was always pulling it on me.

414
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,195
Ready?

415
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,117
Yeah.

416
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,495
Alan, are you ready?

417
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,655
There is no "ready".

418
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,715
I will try it again.

419
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,222
Alan, it doesn't work.

420
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,654
Oh my god

421
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,155
It's not your turn.

422
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,818
Yes I rolled first. Then Peter twice
Because he won the doubles.

423
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,236
Now it's my turn again.

424
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:43,158
No, look.
Two of them are yours, right?

425
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,667
Who else works?

426
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,957
The elephant was mine.

427
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:56,342
you are playing the game
Started in 1969.

428
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,057
have to play.

429
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,222
It's not my turn.

430
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,016
Who's turn?

431
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,360
Sarah Whittle.

432
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,124
This is where she used to live.

433
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,711
This place is appalling.

434
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,096
We often played on this veranda.

435
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,895
I knew she wouldn't live here yet.

436
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,603
Probably married to Billy Jessup
And I live in a trailer park.

437
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,267
- come.
- Let's at least ask.

438
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:55,564
- Maybe she knows where Sarah has gone.
- Of course she would know. she is a psychic.

439
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,323
Good point of view.

440
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,403
I remember the veranda was wider.

441
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,117
Hello?

442
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,917
- Can you help me?
-Do you have a promise?

443
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:12,251
- No, I'm just looking for someone.
- Madam Serena can't see anyone now.

444
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,586
Well, maybe you can help us out.

445
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,757
what is that?

446
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,139
we are looking for someone
who lived here.

447
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,801
No, I have lived here all my life.

448
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,345
Well, you should know Sarah Whittle.

449
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,311
What do you want for Sarah Whittle?

450
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,484
Sara?

451
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,734
No, we no longer use that name.

452
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,779
Sarah Whittle?

453
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,035
what do you want?

454
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:53,792
26 years ago you played a game
with a little boy in the street.

455
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,126
A game with drums.

456
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,014
How do you know?

457
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,557
I was that little boy, Sarah.

458
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,307
Alan?

459
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,491
you killed her

460
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,449
leave a message
The doctor will call you back...

461
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,990
...at his convenience.

462
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:33,836
Dr. Boorstein, Sarah Whittle. listen,
Please call me as soon as possible.

463
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,838
i think i need to have
Checked my dosage.

464
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,672
The incident we were talking about
Didn't actually happen?

465
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,088
oh boy.
Today we have an episode here...

466
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,848
...with a little boy
It didn't really go away.

467
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,850
I'm sitting in his living room.
drinking lemonade

468
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,479
If you would call me, I would really
I am interested in your interpretation.

469
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,265
Thank you very much.

470
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,185
- He will call me back.
-While waiting...

471
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,904
- God! No no no no!
-Sara. Sara.

472
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,235
- Oh, no, no, no.
-Are you okay. Sara. please.

473
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:06,278
I spent over 2000 hours in therapy
Tell yourself that such a thing does not exist.

474
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,072
What happened to you was so terrible,
This is what I made up--

475
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,536
Sarah, it was terrible. It was terrible.

476
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,121
It was terrible, it really was.

477
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,712
But it was true. Authentic.

478
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:21,047
No, no, it wasn't real, Alan. your father
kill you, he chopped you up.

479
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,506
Sarah, come on.

480
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,888
did my dad do that?

481
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,517
My father could barely hold me...

482
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,599
...not to mention chopping me to pieces.

483
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:38,059
26 years ago,
We started playing a little game.

484
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,522
and now...

485
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,156
...we all sit down
And I'm going to finish it.

486
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,192
And guess what.

487
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,031
It's your turn.

488
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,750
no.

489
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,668
here.

490
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,914
Play a game, Sarah.

491
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,921
- Oh, no, no.
-Are you okay.

492
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,840
Just pass the dice
go home No need to play.

493
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,758
Thank you Alan.

494
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,641
oh my god! how can i do that?

495
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,940
It's a law of the law, Sarah.
you will become it.

496
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:22,194
Given all the energy I spent
Visualize you as a radiant spirit--

497
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,946
Now read on.

498
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,612
"It grows much faster than bamboo.

499
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,615
If you're not careful, they'll come after you. "

500
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,535
that's good

501
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,506
oh my god. Please tell me that's not happening.

502
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:46,044
Oh yes. Stay away from walls.
don't touch anything.

503
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,301
No quick movements.

- beautiful.
- Oh, yes, it's beautiful.

And absolutely stay away from the pod.

507
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,398

508
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,370
Peter!

- Hang on, baby.
-Understood? i'll be right back.

514
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,516
I'm sorry, Angus.

515
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:47,901
Harvest time!

516

525
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,196
Let Stan and Willy help you.

526
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:33,576
I'm on my way to the old parish place
to check for suspicious persons.

527
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,662
should have been a firefighter.

528
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,750
Yeah.

529
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,210
Sara!

530
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,756
take your hands off me!

531
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,763
- The game isn't over yet, Sarah.
- Well, it's for me.

532
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,765
You are no longer in the jungle.

533
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,224
stop! you don't treat people like that.

534
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,106
Understood.

535
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,786
Anyone drink iced tea?
I will make tea.

536
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,954
Alan please, when was the last time you played
This game ruined my life.

537
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,174
- Has it ruined your life?
-yes.

538
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:36,134
"In the jungle you have to wait
until the dice rolls 5 or 8. "

539
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,308
I was a little girl, Alan.

540
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,510
you're gone

541
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:47,483
And a flock of bats surrounded me
and followed me down the street.

542
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,481
i was afraid

543
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,646
I'm sorry, Alan.

544
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,482
nobody believed me. I was alone.

545
00:53:55,649 --> 00:54:00,496
So did I, Sarah, for 26 years.

546
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,832
me too.

547
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:08,917
All right, Sarah. We are scared too

548
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,382
But after finishing the game
it all goes away.

549
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,132
What should I do if I get stuck in the game?

550
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,921
It won't.

551
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,720
Because I won't stop playing

552
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,351
And neither do I.

553
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,637
Neither do I.

554
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,987
Come on Sarah.

555
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,363
please?

556
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,041
I knew today was going to be a bad day.

557
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,128
Hey, come on, it's okay

558
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,381
we just have to keep our heads down.

559
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,085
And roll with a punch.

560
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:19,067
"A hunter from the darkest wilds...

561
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,283
...you feel like a child. "

562
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,076
what is that?

563
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,708
Van Pelt.

564
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:38,090
You poor coward!
Please come back and face me like a man.

565
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,600
Not enough, Sonny Jim.

566
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,019
Come ready or not.

567
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,790
Hey you!

568
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,667
drop the gun
And raise your hands to the sky!

569
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,328
No, I can't believe this.

570
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,339
Even if Alan manages to get out of this situation...

571
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,920
...the same thing would happen
again and again.

572
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:04,840
If you hold on to repressed anger,
It attracts a lot of negative energy...

573
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:08,930
...and things happen.
in the jungle. It was no coincidence.

574
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,344
No accidents.

575
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,602
Who's turn?

576
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,270
-It's my turn.
-Really? wonderful.

577
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,185
you could have told us
There was a man who hunted people.

578
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,196
Well, I didn't know.
It's just a roll of the dice.

579
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:24,279
Is he the reason you don't want to play?

580
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,157
Didn't you want to play too?

581
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,370
Mr. We started something 26th year
Must I finish before and now?

582
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,419
what happened to this guy?

583
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:41,084
he is a hunter he kills things what it is
he does Now he wants to kill me.

584
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,592
- why you?
- Why me?

585
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:46,722
I don't know. you would think
It would be a waste of his time.

586
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,757
Maybe he needs something on the wall.

587
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,392
- The parish.
-It's your turn.

588
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,554
have you talked to him
about your difference?

589
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:59,022
- are you crazy? The man has a gun-
- Never call me crazy, Alan! ever.

590
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:03,155
Since then everyone calls me crazy
You said you fell in love with the game.

591
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,571
- It might be better to roll.
-Yeah.

592
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,656
I was the girl who witnessed you get killed.

593
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,242
do you think someone showed up
at my birthday party?

594
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,659
- Hello, I'm rolling now. I'll roll
-Who's Billy?

595
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:18,917
what are you, owl? come on madam
Serena, please dig into your consciousness.

596
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,752
- Here, just roll.
- Find a memory...

597
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,632
...about your old boyfriend Billy.

598
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:26,796
- Little kid stealing your bike?
- The big kid who took you to the movies.

599
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:31,308
"Don't be fooled, this is not thunder.
It would be a mistake to stay here. "

600
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,139
- No, you are immature. no -
-you.

601
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,851
- I know you are, but what am I?
-you. No need to fall for this.

602
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,607
Do you feel so?

603
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,133
Run.

604
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,761
It's a stampede!

605
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,547
- come.
-game!

606
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:17,971
Don't look back!

607
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,255
It's not a game!

608
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,054
Why didn't you get the game, Peter?

609
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,893
Ignore him, honey. he is a Libra.

610
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,683
- where are you going?
-He's going to the water!

611
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,442
Let's go. come.

612
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,022
- Hello?
-This is Aunt Nora. where were you?

613
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,237

Wrong number.

614
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,283
wait for me!

615
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,884
- what can i do for you?
-I'll take all this.

616
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,429
you know they stopped
These were made in 1903.

617
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:44,225
Fuck. then i will need
alternative weapon.

618
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,813
Well, there is time to wait.

619
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:50,068
And these should be filled out.

620
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,197
Alternatively, you can fill in these.

621
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,952
Louise.

622
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,412
Now, anyone ask,
I didn't understand here.

623
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,502
You're not a postman, are you?

624
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,931
Alan!

625
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,427
quiet.

626
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,440
Understood.

627
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,283
Look, boy.

628
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,329
no!

629
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,458
- Peter!
- Peter!

630
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,616
- Peter, are you okay?
-That was great!

631
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,244
I can't believe you did that.
It was very cool.

632
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,873
- You gave me chills. oh my god.
-good.

633
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,371
Alan.

634
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,871
Nice work, isn't it?
Now give me a game. Alright, let's go.

635
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,815
Oh my god

636
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,731
Act naturally.

637
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,732
Hey!

638
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,947
Hide game.

639
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:48,913
i don't believe this
Whenever trouble arises, I run into you.

640
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,662
myself? I don't know
what are you talking about

641
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,752
- All right. I am taking you.
-I'm not going anywhere.

642
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,924
just -

643
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,797
All right.

644
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,756
wait a minute. You can't take him, he-

645
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,516
- her fiancé.
-hang on. You said he is your uncle.

646
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,763
it's okay. i will be back soon.

647
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,442
blast.

648
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,272
remember, you said
You will never abandon your friends.

649
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:21,157
- Finish the game later. Understood?
-later?

650
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,660
Van Pelt. Van Pelt.

651
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,863
I encourage everyone to go home now.

652
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,452
Understood.

653
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:36,130
what to do now
to finish the game?

654
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,042
Can not do that.
I can't finish it without him.

655
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,301
Judy!

656
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:42,637
what?

657
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,178
what happened?

658
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:49,470
I thought I could finish the game on my own.
I was only 10 spaces away.

659
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:52,306
"The laws of Jumanji have been broken...

660
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,691
...it's going backwards
Even more than your token. "

661
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,519
Did you try to deceive me?

662
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,814
No, I tried to drop the dice
So they would land on 12.

663
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,199
Oh, okay, honey.
Well that would be a scam.

664
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,662
Hands up, Peter! Look at your hands!

665
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:38,443
Come in, it's Willie.
They wiped out Larry's hardware.

666
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,322
they can't be stopped.
Drop the National Guard down here now.

667
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,108
All right. what is this about?
You know.

668
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:49,037
yes i will. but you won't
Believe me even if I say so, Carl.

669
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,574
wait a minute. wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?

670
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,538
I know a lot more than that.

671
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,625
i know you were working
At the Parish Shoes stamping line.

672
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,085
They called you the only man.

673
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,421
The only man, yeah, that's right.

674
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,679
I was there too, dude
Until Old Parish fired me.

675
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,010
- Did he fire you?
- Yeah man.

676
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:11,598
And there was something in me, I could turn around
this whole town.

677
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,057
- your shoes.
-right.

678
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,397
Listen, Carl?

679
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,234
I know it doesn't make much sense
26 years later...

680
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,236
…but I’m sorry.

681
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,738
sorry.

682
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,821
sorry for what?

683
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,572
It's me, Alan.

684
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,249
thank you. come.

685
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,455
what happened?

686
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,997
Apparently there's a sale, honey.

687
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,845
I saw three monkeys earlier
You were on your bike, right?

688
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,597
- yes.
- Good girl. come.

689
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:54,261
Well, maybe we can save him
With check.

690
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,020
thank you.

691
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,932
You're that snotty coward that said to me,
if he wants--

692
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,405
boy!

693
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,284
Get out of the way!

694
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,656
Hey boy! what are you doing?

695
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,670
- Give it to me, boy!
-no!

696
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,089
Hey!

697
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,171
- Peter!
-help me!

698
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,843
Get me out of here!

699
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,677
- it's okay.
- Oh my God, Peter. come.

700
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,520

Are you okay,
As long as we don't forget each other.
