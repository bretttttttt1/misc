LIVING DUMMY 
Goosebumps - 07

“Mmmmm! Mmmm! Mmmmm!” 

Kris Powell struggled to get her twin sister’s attention. 

Lindy Powell glanced up from the book she was reading to see what 
the problem was. Instead of her sister’s pretty face, Lindy saw a round, pink 
bubble nearly the size of Kris’ head. 

“Nice one,” Lindy said without much enthusiasm. With a sudden 
move, she poked the bubble and popped it. 

“Hey!” Kris cried as the pink bubble gum exploded onto her cheeks 
and chin. 

Lindy laughed. “Gotcha.” 

Kris angrily grabbed Lindy’s paperback and slammed it shut. “Whoops 
—lost your place!” she exclaimed. She knew her sister hated to lose her 
place in a book. 

Lindy grabbed the book back with a scowl. Kris struggled to pull the 
pink gum off her face. 

“That was the biggest bubble I ever blew,” she said angrily. The gum 
wasn’t coming off her chin. 

“I’ve blown much bigger than that,” Lindy said with a superior sneer. 

“I don’t believe you two,” their mother muttered, making her way into 
their bedroom and dropping a neatly folded pile of laundry at the foot of 
Kris’ bed. “You even compete over bubble gum?” 

“We’re not competing,” Lindy muttered. She tossed back her blonde 
ponytail and returned her eyes to her book. 

Both girls had straight blonde hair. But Lindy kept hers long, usually 
tying it behind her head or on one side in a ponytail. And Kris had hers cut 
very short. 

It was a way for people to tell the twins apart, for they were nearly 
identical in every other way. Both had broad foreheads and round, blue 
eyes. Both had dimples in their cheeks when they smiled. Both blushed 
easily, large pink circles forming on their pale cheeks. 

Both thought their noses were a little too wide. Both wished they were 
a little taller. Lindy’s best friend, Alice, was nearly three inches taller, even 



though she hadn’t turned twelve yet. 

“Did I get it all off?” Kris asked, rubbing her chin, which was red and 
sticky. 

“Not all,” Lindy told her, glancing up. “There’s some in your hair.” 

“Oh, great,” Kris muttered. She grabbed at her hair, but couldn’t find 
any bubble gum. 

“Gotcha again,” Lindy said, laughing. “You’re too easy!” 

Kris uttered an angry growl. “Why are you always so mean to me?” 

“Me? Mean?” Lindy looked up in wide-eyed innocence. “I’m an angel. 
Ask anyone.” 

Exasperated, Kris turned back to her mother, who was stuffing socks 
into a dresser drawer. “Mom, when am I going to get my own room?” 

“On the Twelfth of Never,” Mrs. Powell replied, grinning. 

Kris groaned. “That’s what you always say.” 

Her mother shrugged. “You know we don’t have a spare inch, Kris.” 
She turned to the bedroom window. Bright sunlight streamed through the 
filmy curtains. “It’s a beautiful day. What are you two doing inside?” 

“Mom, we’re not little girls,” Lindy said, rolling her eyes. “We’re 
twelve. We’re too old to go out and play.” 

“Did I get it all?” Kris asked, still scraping pink patches of bubble gum 
off her chin. 

“Leave it. It improves your complexion,” Lindy told her. 

“I wish you girls would be nicer to each other,” Mrs. Powell said with 
a sigh. 

They suddenly heard shrill barking coming from downstairs. “What’s 
Barky excited about now?” Mrs. Powell fretted. The little black terrier was 
always barking about something. “Why not take Barky for a walk?” 

“Don’t feel like it,” Lindy muttered, nose in her book. 

“What about those beautiful new bikes you got for your birthdays?” 
Mrs. Powell said, hands on hips. “Those bikes you just couldn’t live 
without. You know, the ones that have been sitting in the garage since you 
got them.” 

“Okay, okay. You don’t have to be sarcastic, Mom,” Lindy said, 
closing her book. She stood up, stretched, and tossed the book onto her bed. 

“You want to?” Kris asked Lindy. 

“Want to what?” 



“Go for a bike ride. We could ride to the playground, see if anyone’s 
hanging out at school.” 

“You just want to see if Robby is there,” Lindy said, making a face. 

“So?” Kris said, blushing. 

“Go on. Get some fresh air,” Mrs. Powell urged. “I’ll see you later. I’m 
off to the supermarket.” 

Kris peered into the dresser mirror. She had gotten most of the gum 
off. She bmshed her short, hair back with both hands. “Come on. Let’s go 
out,” she said. “Last one out is a rotten egg.” She darted to the doorway, 
beating her sister by half a step. 

As they burst out the back door, with Barky yipping shrilly behind 
them, the afternoon sun was high in a cloudless sky. The air was still and 
dry. It felt more like summer than spring. 

Both girls were wearing shorts and sleeveless T-shirts. Lindy bent to 
pull open the garage door, then stopped. The house next door caught her 
eye. 

“Look—they’ve got the walls up,” she told Kris, pointing across their 
back yard. 

“That new house is going up so quickly. It’s amazing,” Kris said 
following her sister’s gaze. 

The builders had knocked down the old house during the winter. The 
new concrete foundation had been put down in March. Lindy and Kris had 
walked around on it when no workers were there, trying to figure out where 
the different rooms would go. 

And now the walls had been built. The construction suddenly looked 
like a real house, rising up in the midst of tall stacks of lumber, a big mound 
of red-brown dirt, a pile of concrete blocks, and an assortment of power 
saws, tools, and machinery. 

“No one’s working today,” Lindy said. 

They took a few steps toward the new house. “Who do you think will 
move in?” Kris wondered. “Maybe some great-looking guy our age. Maybe 
great-looking twin guys!” 

“Yuck!” Lindy made a disgusted face. “Twin guys? How drippy can 
you get! I can’t believe you and I are in the same family.” 

Kris was used to Lindy’s sarcasm. Both girls liked being twins and 
hated being twins at the same time. Because they shared nearly everything 



—their looks, their clothing, their room—they were closer than most sisters 
ever get. 

But because they were so much alike, they also managed to drive each 
other crazy a lot of the time. 

“No one’s around. Let’s check out the new house,” Lindy said. 

Kris followed her across the yard. A squirrel, halfway up the wide 
trunk of a maple tree, watched them warily. 

They made their way through an opening in the low shrubs that 
divided the two yards. Then, walking past the stacks of lumber and the tall 
mound of dirt, they climbed the concrete stoop. 

A sheet of heavy plastic had been nailed over the opening where the 
front door would go. Kris pulled one end of the plastic up, and they slipped 
into the house. 

It was dark and cool inside and had a fresh wood smell. The plaster 
walls were up but hadn’t been painted. 

“Careful,” Lindy warned. “Nails.” She pointed to the large nails 
scattered over the floor. “If you step on one, you’ll get lockjaw and die.” 

“You wish,” Kris said. 

“I don’t want you to die,” Lindy replied. “Just get lockjaw.” She 
snickered. 

“Ha-ha,” Kris said sarcastically. “This must be the living room,” she 
said, making her way carefully across the front room to the fireplace against 
the back wall. 

“A cathedral ceiling,” Lindy said, staring up at the dark, exposed 
wooden beams above their heads. “Neat.” 

“This is bigger than our living room,” Kris remarked, peering out the 
large picture window to the street. 

“It smells great,” Lindy said, taking a deep breath. “All the sawdust. It 
smells so piney.” 

They made their way through the hall and explored the kitchen. “Are 
those wires on?” Kris asked, pointing to a cluster of black electrical wires 
suspended from the ceiling beams. 

“Why don’t you touch one and find out?” Lindy suggested. 

“You first,” Kris shot back. 

“The kitchen isn’t very big,” Lindy said, bending down to stare into 
the holes where the kitchen cabinets would go. 



She stood up and was about to suggest they check out the upstairs 
when she heard a sound. “Huh?” Her eyes widened in surprise. “Is someone 
in here?” 

Kris froze in the middle of the kitchen. 

They both listened. 

Silence. 

Then they heard soft, rapid footsteps. Close by. Inside the house. 

“Let’s go!” Lindy whispered. 

Kris was already ducking under the plastic, heading out the doorway 
opening. She leapt off the back stoop and started running toward their back 
yard. 

Lindy stopped at the bottom of the stoop and turned back to the new 
house. “Hey—look!” she called. 

A squirrel came flying out a side window. It landed on the dirt with all 
four feet moving and scrambled toward the maple tree in the Powells’ yard. 

Lindy laughed. “Just a dumb squirrel.” 

Kris stopped near the low shrubs. “You sure?” She hesitated, watching 
the windows of the new house. “That was a pretty loud squirrel.” 

When she turned back from the house, she was surprised to find that 
Lindy had disappeared. 

“Hey—where’d you go?” 

“Over here,” Lindy called. “I see something!” 

It took Kris a while to locate her sister. Lindy was half-hidden behind a 
large black trash Dumpster at the far end of the yard. 

Kris shielded her eyes with one hand to see better. Lindy was bent over 
the side of the Dumpster. She appeared to be rummaging through some 
trash. 

“What’s in there?” Kris called. 

Lindy was tossing things around and didn’t seem to hear her. 

“What is it?” Kris called, taking a few reluctant steps toward the 
Dumpster. 

Lindy didn’t reply. 

Then, slowly, she pulled something out. She started to hold it up. Its 
arms and legs dangled down limply. Kris could see a head with brown hair. 

A head? Arms and legs? 

“Oh, no!” Kris cried aloud, raising her hands to her face in horror. 



2 


A child? 

Kris uttered a silent gasp, staring in horror as Lindy lifted him out of 
the trash Dumpster. 

She could see his face, frozen in a wide-eyed stare. His brown hair 
stood stiffly on top of his head. He seemed to be wearing some sort of gray 
suit. 

His arms and legs dangled lifelessly. 

“Lindy!” Kris called, her throat tight with fear. “Is it—is he... alive?” 

Her heart pounding, Kris started to run to her sister. Lindy was 
cradling the poor thing in her arms. 

“Is he alive?” Kris repeated breathlessly. 

She stopped short when her sister started to laugh. 

“No. Not alive!” Lindy called gleefully. 

And then Kris realized that it wasn’t a child after all. “A dummy!” she 
shrieked. 

Lindy held it up. “A ventriloquist’s dummy,” she said. “Someone 
threw him out. Do you believe it? He’s in perfect shape.” 

It took Lindy a while to notice that Kris was breathing hard, her face 
bright red. “Kris, what’s your problem? Oh, wow. Did you think he was a 
real kid?” Lindy laughed scornfully. 

“No. Of course not,” Kris insisted. 

Lindy held the dummy up and examined his back, looking for the 
string to pull to make his mouth move. “I am a real kid!” Lindy made him 
say. She was speaking in a high-pitched voice through gritted teeth, trying 
not to move her lips. 

“Dumb,” Kris said, rolling her eyes. 

“I am not dumb. You’re dumb!” Lindy made the dummy say in a high, 
squeaky voice. When she pulled the string in his back, the wooden lips 
moved up and down, clicking as they moved. She moved her hand up his 
back and found the control to make his painted eyes shift from side to side. 

“He’s probably filled with bugs,” Kris said, making a disgusted face. 
“Throw him back, Lindy.” 



“No way,” Lindy insisted, rubbing her hand tenderly over the dummy’s 
wooden hair. “I’m keeping him.” 

“She’s keeping me,” she made the dummy say. 

Kris stared suspiciously at the dummy. His brown hair was painted on 
his head. His blue eyes moved only from side to side and couldn’t blink. He 
had bright red painted lips, curved up into an eerie smile. The lower lip had 
a chip on one side so that it didn’t quite match the upper lip. 

The dummy wore a gray, double-breasted suit over a white shirt collar. 
The collar wasn’t attached to a shirt. Instead, the dummy’s wooden chest 
was painted white. Big brown leather shoes were attached to the ends of his 
thin, dangling legs. 

“My name is Slappy,” Lindy made the dummy say, moving his 
grinning mouth up and down. 

“Dumb,” Kris repeated, shaking her head. “Why Slappy?” 

“Come over here and I’ll slap you!” Lindy made him say, trying not to 
move her lips. 

Kris groaned. “Are we going to ride our bikes to the playground or 
not, Lindy?” 

“Afraid poor Robby misses you?” Lindy made Slappy ask. 

“Put that ugly thing down,” Kris replied impatiently. 

“I’m not ugly,” Slappy said in Lindy’s squeaky voice, sliding his eyes 
from side to side. “You’re ugly!” 

“Your lips are moving,” Kris told Lindy. “You’re a lousy 
ventriloquist.” 

“I’ll get better,” Lindy insisted. 

“You mean you’re really keeping it?” Kris cried. 

“I like Slappy. He’s cute,” Lindy said, cuddling the dummy against the 
front of her T-shirt. 

“I’m cute,” she made him say. “And you’re ugly.” 

“Shut up,” Kris snapped to the dummy. 

“You shut up!” Slappy replied in Lindy’s tight, high-pitched voice. 

“What do you want to keep him for?” Kris asked, following her sister 
toward the street. 

“I always liked puppets,” Lindy recalled. “Remember those 
marionettes I used to have? I played with them for hours at a time. I made 
up long plays with them.” 



“I always played with the marionettes, too,” Kris remembered. 

“You got the strings all tangled up,” Lindy said, frowning. “You 
weren’t any good at it.” 

“But what are you going to do with this dummy?” Kris demanded. 

“I don’t know. Maybe I’ll work up an act,” Lindy said thoughtfully, 
shifting Slappy to her other arm. “I’ll bet I could earn some money with 
him. You know. Appear at kids’ birthday parties. Put on shows.” 

“Happy birthday!” she made Slappy declare. “Hand over some 
money!” 

Kris didn’t laugh. 

The two girls walked along the street in front of their house. Lindy 
cradled Slappy in her arms, one hand up his back. 

“I think he’s creepy,” Kris said, kicking a large pebble across the 
street. “You should put him back in the Dumpster.” 

“No way,” Lindy insisted. 

“No way,” she made Slappy say, shaking his head, his glassy blue eyes 
moving from side to side. “I’ll put you in the Dumpster!” 

“Slappy sure is mean,” Kris remarked, frowning at Lindy. 

Lindy laughed. “Don’t look at me,” she teased. “Complain to Slappy.” 

Kris scowled. 

“You’re jealous,” Lindy said. “Because I found him and you didn’t.” 

Kris started to protest, but they both heard voices. Kris looked up to 
see the two Marshall kids from down the block running toward them. They 
were cute, red-headed kids that Lindy and Kris sometimes baby-sat for. 

“What’s that?” Amy Marshall asked, pointing at Slappy. 

“Does he talk?” her younger brother, Ben, asked, staying several feet 
away, an uncertain expression on his freckled face. 

“Hi, I’m Slappy!” Lindy made the dummy call out. She cradled Slappy 
in one arm, making him sit up straight, his arms dangling at his sides. 

“Where’d you get him?” Amy asked. 

“Do his eyes move?” Ben asked, still hanging back. 

“Do your eyes move?” Slappy asked Ben. 

Both Marshall kids laughed. Ben forgot his reluctance. He stepped up 
and grabbed Slappy’s hand. 

“Ouch! Not so hard!” Slappy cried. 

Ben dropped the hand with a gasp. Then he and Amy collapsed in 



gleeful laughter. 

“Ha-ha-ha-ha!” Lindy made Slappy laugh, tilting his head back and 
opening his mouth wide. 

The two kids thought that was a riot. They laughed even harder. 

Pleased by the response she was getting, Lindy glanced at her sister. 
Kris was sitting on the curb, cradling her head in her hands, a dejected look 
on her face. 

She’s jealous, Lindy realized. Kris sees that the kids really like Slappy 
and that I’m getting all the attention. And she’s totally jealous. 

I’m definitely keeping Slappy! Lindy told herself, secretly pleased at 
her little triumph. 

She stared into the dummy’s bright blue painted eyes. To her surprise, 
the dummy seemed to be staring back at her, a twinkle of sunlight in his 
eyes, his grin wide and knowing.

“Who was that on the phone?” Mr. Powell asked, shoveling another forkful 
of spaghetti into his mouth. 

Lindy slipped back into her place at the table. “It was Mrs. Marshall. 
Down the block.” 

“Does she want you to baby-sit?” Mrs. Powell asked, reaching for the 
salad bowl. She turned to Kris. “Don’t you want any salad?” 

Kris wiped spaghetti sauce off her chin with her napkin. “Maybe 
later.” 

“No,” Lindy answered. “She wants me to perform. At Amy’s birthday 
party. With Slappy.” 

“Your first job,” Mr. Powell said, a smile crossing his slender face. 

“Amy and Ben liked Slappy so much, they insisted on him,” Lindy 
said. “Mrs. Marshall is going to pay me twenty dollars.” 

“That’s great!” their mother exclaimed. She passed the salad bowl 
across the table to her husband. 

It had been a week since Lindy rescued Slappy from the trash 
Dumpster. Every day after school, she had spent hours up in her room 
rehearsing with him, working on his voice, practicing not moving her lips, 
thinking up jokes to perform with him. 

Kris kept insisting the whole thing was dumb. “I can’t believe you’re 
being such a nerd,” she told her sister. She refused to be an audience for 
Lindy’s routines. 

But when Lindy brought Slappy into school on Friday, Kris’ attitude 
began to change. A group of kids had gathered around Lindy outside her 
locker. 

As Lindy made Slappy talk for them, Kris watched from down the 
hall. She’s going to make a total fool of herself, Kris thought. 

But to her surprise, the kids hooted and howled. They thought Slappy 
was a riot. Even Robby Martin, the guy Kris had had a crush on for two 
years, thought Lindy was terrific. 

Watching Robby laugh along with the other kids made Kris think hard. 
Becoming a ventriloquist might be fun. 



And profitable. Lindy was going to earn twenty dollars at the 
Marshalls’ birthday party. And when word got around, she’d probably 
perform at a lot of parties and earn even more money. 

After dinner that evening, Lindy and Kris washed and dried the dishes. 
Then Lindy asked her parents if she could practice her new comedy routine 
on them. She hurried up to her room to get Slappy. 

Mr. and Mrs. Powell took a seat on the living room couch. “Maybe 
Lindy will be a TV star,” Mrs. Powell said. 

“Maybe,” Mr. Powell agreed, settling back on the couch, a pleased 
smile on his face. Barky yapped and climbed between Mr. and Mrs. Powell, 
his tiny stub of a tail wagging furiously. 

“You know you’re not allowed on the couch,” Mrs. Powell said, 
sighing. But she made no move to push Barky off. 

Kris sat down away from the others, on the floor by the steps, cradling 
her chin in her hands. 

“You’re looking glum this evening,” her father remarked. 

“Can I get a dummy, too?” Kris asked. She hadn’t really planned to 
say it. The question just popped out of her mouth. 

Lindy came back into the room, carrying Slappy around the waist. 
“Ready?” she asked. She pulled a dining room chair into the center of the 
living room and sat down on it. 

“Well, can I?” Kris repeated. 

“You really want one, too?” Mrs. Powell asked, surprised. 

“Want what?” Lindy asked, confused. 

“Kris says she wants a dummy, too,” Mrs. Powell reported. 

“No way,” Lindy said heatedly. “Why do you want to be such a 
copycat?” 

“It looks like fun,” Kris replied, her cheeks turning bright pink. “If you 
can do it, I can do it, too,” she added shrilly. 

“You always copy everything I do,” Lindy protested angrily. “Why 
don’t you find something of your own for once? Go upstairs and work on 
your junk jewelry collection. That’s your hobby. Let me be the 
ventriloquist.” 

“Girls”—Mr. Powell started, raising a hand for quiet—“please, don’t 
fight over a dummy.” 

“I really think I’d be better at it,” Kris said. “I mean, Lindy isn’t very 



funny.” 

“Everyone thinks I’m funny,” Lindy insisted. 

“That’s not very nice, Kris,” Mrs. Powell scolded. 

“Well, I just think if Lindy has one, I should be able to have one, too,” 
Kris said to her parents. 

“Copycat,” Lindy repeated, shaking her head. “You’ve been putting 
me down all week. You said it was nerdy. But I know why you changed 
your mind. You’re upset because I’m going to earn some money and you’re 
not.” 

“I really wish you two wouldn’t argue about everything,” Mr. Powell 
said disgustedly. 

“Well, can I have a dummy?” Kris asked him. 

“They’re expensive,” Mr. Powell replied, glancing at his wife. “A good 
one will cost more than a hundred dollars. I really don’t think we can afford 
to buy one now.” 

“Why don’t you both share Slappy?” Mrs. Powell suggested. 

“Huh?” Lindy’s mouth dropped open in protest. 

“You two always share everything,” Mrs. Powell continued. “So why 
don’t you share Slappy?” 

“But, Mom—” Lindy whined unhappily. 

“Excellent idea,” Mr. Powell interrupted. He motioned to Kris. “Try it 
out. After you share him for a while, I’m sure one of you will lose interest 
in him. Maybe even both of you.” 

Kris climbed to her feet and walked over to Lindy. She reached out for 
the dummy. “I don’t mind sharing,” she said quietly, searching her sister’s 
eyes for approval of the idea. “Can I hold him for just a second?” 

Lindy held onto Slappy tightly. 

Suddenly the dummy’s head tilted back and his mouth opened wide. 
“Beat it, Kris!” he snarled in a harsh raspy voice. “Get lost, you stupid 
moron!” 

Before Kris could back away, Slappy’s wooden hand shot up, and he 
slapped her hard across the face.

“Ow!” 

Kris screamed and raised her hand to her cheek, which was bright 
pink. She stepped back. “Stop it, Lindy! That hurt!” 

“Me?” Lindy cried. “I didn’t do it! Slappy did!” 

“Don’t be dumb,” Kris protested, rubbing her cheek. “You really hurt 

me.” 

“But I didn’t do it!” Lindy cried. She turned Slappy’s face toward her. 
“Why were you so rude to Kris?” 

Mr. Powell jumped up from the couch. “Stop acting dumb and 
apologize to your sister,” he ordered. 

Lindy bowed Slappy’s head. “I’m sorry,” she made the dummy say. 

“No. In your own voice,” Mr. Powell insisted, crossing his arms in 
front of his chest. “Slappy didn’t hurt Kris. You did.” 

“Okay, okay,” Lindy muttered, blushing. She avoided Kris’ angry 
stare. “I’m sorry. Here.” She dumped Slappy into Kris’ arms. 

Kris was so surprised, she nearly dropped the dummy. Slappy was 
heavier than she’d imagined. 

“Now what am I supposed to do with him?” Kris asked Lindy. 

Lindy shrugged and crossed the room to the couch, where she dropped 
down beside her mother. 

“Why’d you make such a fuss?” Mrs. Powell whispered, leaning close 
to Lindy. “That was so babyish.” 

Lindy blushed. “Slappy is mine! Why can’t something be mine for 
once?” 

“Sometimes you girls are so nice to each other, and sometimes...” 
Mrs. Powell’s voice trailed off. 

Mr. Powell took a seat on the padded arm of the chair across the room. 

“How do I make his mouth work?” Kris asked, tilting the dummy 
upside down to examine its back. 

“There’s a string in his back, inside the slit in his jacket,” Lindy told 
her grudgingly. “You just pull it.” 

I don’t want Kris to work Slappy, Lindy thought unhappily. 



I don’t want to share Slappy. 

Why can’t I have something that just belongs to me? Why do I have to 
share everything with her? 

Why does Kris always want to copy me? 

She gritted her teeth and waited for her anger to fade. 

Later that night, Kris sat straight up in bed. She’d had a bad dream. 

I was being chased, she remembered, her heart still pounding. Chased 
by what? By whom? 

She couldn’t remember. 

She glanced around the shadowy room, waiting for her heartbeat to 
return to normal. The room felt hot and stuffy, even though the window was 
open and the curtains were fluttering. 

Lindy lay sound asleep on her side in the twin bed next to Kris’. She 
was snoring softly, her lips slightly parted, her long hair falling loose about 
her face. 

Kris glanced at the clock-radio on the bed table between the two twin 
beds. It was nearly three in the morning. 

Even though she was now wide awake, the nightmare wouldn’t 
completely fade away. She still felt uncomfortable, a little frightened, as if 
she were still being chased by someone or something. The back of her neck 
felt hot and prickly. 

She turned and fluffed up her pillow, propping it higher on the 
headboard. As she lay back on it, something caught her eye. 

Someone sitting in the chair in front of the bedroom window. Someone 
staring at her. 

After a sharp intake of breath, she realized it was Slappy. 

Yellow moonlight poured over him, making his staring eyes glow. He 
was sitting up in the chair, tilted to the right at a slight angle, one arm 
resting on the slender arm of the chair. 

His mouth locked in a wide, mocking grin, his eyes seemed to be 
staring right at Kris. 

Kris stared back, studying the dummy’s expression in the eerie yellow 
moonlight. Then, without thinking, without even realizing what she was 
doing, she climbed silently out of bed. 

Her foot got tangled in the bedsheet and she nearly tripped. Kicking 



the sheet away, she made her way quickly across the room to the window. 

Slappy stared up at her as her shadow fell over him. His grin seemed 
to grow wider as Kris leaned closer. 

A gust of wind made the soft curtains flutter against her face. Kris 
pushed them away and peered down at the dummy’s painted head. 

She reached a hand out and rubbed his wooden hair, shining in the 
moonlight. His head felt warm, warmer than she’d imagined. 

Kris quickly jerked her hand away. 

What was that sound? 

Had Slappy snickered? Had he laughed at her? 

No. Of course not. 

Kris realized she was breathing hard. 

Why am I so freaked out by this stupid dummy? she thought. 

In the bed behind her, Lindy made a gurgling sound and rolled onto 
her back. 

Kris stared hard into Slappy’s big eyes, gleaming in the light from the 
window. She waited for him to blink or to roll his eyes from side to side. 

She suddenly felt foolish. 

He’s just a stupid wooden dummy, she told herself. 

She reached out and pushed him over. 

The stiff body swung to the side. The hard head made a soft clonk as it 
hit the wooden arm of the chair. 

Kris stared down at him, feeling strangely satisfied, as if she’d 
somehow taught him a lesson. 

The curtains rustled against her face again. She pushed them away. 

Feeling sleepy, she started back to bed. 

She had only gone one step when Slappy reached up and grabbed her 
wrist.

“Oh!” As the hand tightened around her wrist, Kris cried out and spun 
around. 

To her surprise, Lindy was crouched beside her. Lindy had a tight grip 
on Kris’ wrist. 

Kris jerked her hand from Lindy’s grasp. 

Moonlight through the window lit up Lindy’s devilish grin. “Gotcha 
again!” she declared. 

“You didn’t scare me!” Kris insisted. But her voice came out a 
trembling whisper. 

“You jumped a mile!” Lindy exclaimed gleefully. “You really thought 
the dummy grabbed you.” 

“Did not!” Kris replied. She hurried to her bed. 

“What were you doing up, anyway?” Lindy demanded. “Were you 
messing with Slappy?” 

“No. I... uh... had a bad dream,” Kris told her. “I just went to look out 
the window.” 

Lindy snickered. “You should’ve seen the look on your face.” 

“I’m going back to sleep. Leave me alone,” Kris snapped. She pulled 
the covers up to her chin. 

Lindy pushed the dummy back to a sitting position. Then she returned 
to her bed, still chuckling over the scare she’d given her sister. 

Kris rearranged her pillows, then glanced across the room to the 
window. The dummy’s face was half covered in shadow now. But the eyes 
glowed as if he were alive. And they stared into hers as if they were trying 
to tell her something. 

Why does he have to grin like that? Kris asked herself, trying to rub 
away the prickly feeling on the back of her neck. 

She pulled up the sheet, settled into the bed, and turned on her side, 
away from the wide, staring eyes. 

But even with her back turned, she could feel them gazing at her. Even 
with her eyes closed and the covers pulled up to her head, she could picture 
the shadowy, distorted grin, the unblinking eyes. Staring at her. Staring. 



Staring. 

She drifted into an uncomfortable sleep, drifted into another dark 
nightmare. Someone was chasing her. Someone very evil was chasing her. 

But who? 

On Monday afternoon, Lindy and Kris both stayed after school to rehearse 
for the spring concert. It was nearly five when they arrived home, and they 
were surprised to see their dad’s car in the driveway. 

“You’re home so early!” Kris exclaimed, finding him in the kitchen 
helping their mother prepare dinner. 

“I’m leaving tomorrow for a sales conference in Portland,” Mr. Powell 
explained, peeling an onion over the sink with a small paring knife. “So I 
only worked half a day today.” 

“What’s for dinner?” Lindy asked. 

“Meatloaf,” Mrs. Powell replied, “if your father ever gets the onion 
peeled.” 

“There’s a trick to not crying when you peel an onion,” Mr. Powell 
said, tears rolling down his cheeks. “Wish I knew it.” 

“How was chorus rehearsal?” Mrs. Powell asked, kneading a big ball 
of red ground beef in her hands. 

“Boring,” Lindy complained, opening the refrigerator and taking out a 
can of Coke. 

“Yeah. We’re doing all these Russian and Yugoslavian songs,” Kris 
said. “They’re so sad. They’re all about sheep or something. We don’t 
really know what they’re about. There’s no translation.” 

Mr. Powell mshed to the sink and began splashing cold water on his 
red, runny eyes. “I can’t take this!” he wailed. He tossed the half-peeled 
onion back to his wife. 

“Crybaby,” she muttered, shaking her head. 

Kris headed up the stairs to drop her backpack in her room. She tossed 
it onto the desk she shared with Lindy, then turned to go back downstairs. 

But something by the window caught her eye. 

Spinning around, she gasped. 

“Oh, no!” The startled cry escaped her lips. 

Kris raised her hands to her cheeks and stared in disbelief. 

Slappy was propped up in the chair in front of the window, grinning at 



her with his usual wide-eyed stare. And seated beside him was another 
dummy, also grinning at her. 

And they were holding hands. 

“What’s going on here?” Kris cried aloud.

“Do you like him?” 

At first, Kris thought that Slappy had asked the question. 

She gaped in stunned disbelief. 

“Well? What do you think of him?” 

It took Kris a long moment to realize that the voice was coming from 
behind her. She turned to find her father standing in the doorway, still 
dabbing at his eyes with a wet dishtowel. 

“The—the new dummy?” Kris stammered. 

“He’s for you,” Mr. Powell said, stepping into the room, the wet towel 
pressed against both eyes. 

“Really?” Kris hurried over to the chair and picked the new dummy up 
to examine him. 

“There’s a tiny pawnshop on the corner across from my office,” Mr. 
Powell said, lowering the towel. “I was walking past and, believe it or not, 
this guy was in the window. He was cheap, too. I think the pawnbroker was 
glad to get rid of him.” 

“He’s... cute,” Kris said, searching for the right word. “He looks just 
like Lindy’s dummy, except his hair is bright red, not brown.” 

“Probably made by the same company,” Mr. Powell said. 

“His clothes are better than Slappy’s,” Kris said, holding the dummy 
out at arm’s length to get a good view. “I hate that stupid gray suit on 
Lindy’s dummy.” 

The new dummy wore blue denim jeans and a red-and-green flannel 
shirt. And instead of the formal-looking, shiny brown shoes, he had white 
high-top sneakers on his feet. 

“So you like him?” Mr. Powell asked, smiling. 

“I love him!” Kris cried happily. She crossed the room and gave her 
dad a hug. 

Then she picked up the dummy and ran out of the room, down the 
stairs, and into the kitchen. “Hey, everybody! Meet Mr. Wood!” she 
declared happily, holding the grinning dummy up in front of her. 

Barky yapped excitedly, leaping up to nip at the dummy’s sneakers. 



Kris pulled her dummy away. 

“Hey!” Lindy cried in surprise. “Where’d you get that?” 

“From Daddy,” Kris said, her grin wider than the dummy’s. “I’m going 
to start practicing with him after dinner, and I’m going to be a better 
ventriloquist than you.” 

“Kris!” Mrs. Powell scolded. “Everything isn’t a competition, you 
know!” 

“I already have a job with Slappy,” Lindy said with a superior sneer. 
“And you’re just getting started. You’re just a beginner.” 

“Mr. Wood is much better-looking than Slappy,” Kris said, mirroring 
her twin’s sneer. “Mr. Wood is cool-looking. That gray suit on your dummy 
is the pits.” 

“You think that ratty old shirt is cool-looking?” Lindy scoffed, making 
a disgusted face. “Yuck. That old dummy probably has worms!” 

“You have worms!” Kris exclaimed. 

“Your dummy won’t be funny,” Lindy said nastily, “because you don’t 
have a sense of humor.” 

“Oh, yeah?” Kris replied, tossing Mr. Wood over her shoulder. “I must 
have a sense of humor. I put up with you, don’t I?” 

“Copycat! Copycat!” Lindy cried angrily. 

“Out of the kitchen!” Mrs. Powell ordered with an impatient shriek. 
“Out! Get out! You two are impossible! The dummies have better 
personalities than either of you!” 

“Thanks, Mom,” Kris said sarcastically. 

“Call me for dinner,” Lindy called back. “I’m going upstairs to 
practice my act with Slappy for the birthday party on Saturday.” 

It was the next afternoon, and Kris was sitting at the dressing table she 
shared with Lindy. Kris rummaged in the jewelry box and pulled out 
another string of brightly colored beads. She slipped them over her head 
and untangled them from the other three strands of beads she was wearing. 
Then she gazed at herself in the mirror, shaking her head to better see the 
long, dangly earrings. 

I love my junk jewelry collection, she thought, digging into the depths 
of the wooden jewelry box to see what other treasures she could pull out. 

Lindy had no interest in the stuff. But Kris could spend hours trying on 



the beads, fingering the dozens of little charms, running her fingers over the 
plastic bracelets, jangling the earrings. Her jewelry collection always 
cheered her up. 

She shook her head again, making the long earrings jangle. A knock on 
the bedroom door made her spin around. 

“Hey, Kris, how’s it going?” Her friend Cody Matthews stepped into 
the room. He had straight, white-blond hair, and pale gray eyes in a slender, 
serious face. Cody always looked as if he were deep in thought. 

“You ride your bike over?” Kris asked, removing several strands of 
beads at once and tossing them into the jewelry box. 

“No. Walked,” Cody replied. “Why’d you call? You just want to hang 
out?” 

“No.” Kris jumped to her feet. She walked over to the chair by the 
window and grabbed up Mr. Wood. “I want to practice my act.” 

Cody groaned. “I’m the guinea pig?” 

“No. The audience. Come on.” 

She led him out to the bent old maple tree in the middle of her back 
yard. The afternoon sun was just beginning to lower itself in the clear, 
spring-blue sky. 

She raised one foot against the tree trunk and propped Mr. Wood on 
her knee. Cody sprawled on his back in the shade. “Tell me if this is funny,” 
she instructed. 

“Okay. Shoot,” Cody replied, narrowing his eyes in concentration. 

Kris turned Mr. Wood to face her. “How are you today?” she asked 

him. 

“Pretty good. Knock wood,” she made the dummy say. 

She waited for Cody to laugh, but he didn’t. “Was that funny?” she 
asked. 

“Kinda,” he replied without enthusiasm. “Keep going.” 

“Okay.” Kris lowered her head so that she was face-to-face with her 
dummy. “Mr. Wood,” she said, “why were you standing in front of the 
mirror with your eyes closed?” 

“Well,” answered the dummy in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, “I 
wanted to see what I look like when I’m asleep!” 

Kris tilted the dummy’s head back and made him look as if he were 
laughing. “How about that joke?” she asked Cody. 



Cody shrugged. “Better, I guess.” 

“Aw, you’re no help!” Kris screamed angrily. She lowered her arms, 
and Mr. Wood crumpled onto her lap. “You’re supposed to tell me if it’s 
funny or not.” 

“I guess not, ” Cody said thoughtfully. 

Kris groaned. “I need some good joke books,” she said. “That’s all. 
Some good joke books with some really funny jokes. Then I’d be ready to 
perform. Because I’m a pretty good ventriloquist, right?” 

“I guess,” Cody replied, pulling up a handful of grass and letting the 
moist, green blades sift through his fingers. 

“Well, I don’t move my lips very much, do I ?” Kris demanded. 

“Not too much,” Cody allowed. “But you don’t really throw your 
voice.” 

“No one can throw her voice,” Kris told him. “It’s just an illusion. You 
make people think you’re throwing your voice. You don’t really throw it.” 

“Oh,” Cody said, pulling up another handful of grass. 

Kris tried out several more jokes. “What do you think?” she asked 
Cody. 

“I think I have to go home,” Cody said. He tossed a handful of grass at 
her. 

Kris brushed the green blades off Mr. Wood’s wooden head. She 
mbbed her hand gently over the dummy’s painted red hair. “You’re hurting 
Mr. Wood’s feelings,” she told Cody. 

Cody climbed to his feet. “Why do you want to mess with that thing, 
anyway?” he asked, pushing his white-blond hair back off his forehead. 

“Because it’s fun,” Kris replied. 

“Is that the real reason?” Cody demanded. 

“Well... I guess I want to show Lindy that I’m better at it than she is.” 

“You two are weird!” Cody declared. “See you in school.” He gave 
her a little wave, then turned and headed for his home down the block. 

Kris pulled down the blankets and climbed into bed. Pale moonlight filtered 
in through the bedroom window. 

Yawning, she glanced at the clock-radio. Nearly ten. She could hear 
Lindy brushing her teeth in the bathroom across the hall. 

Why does Lindy always hum when she brushes her teeth? Kris 



wondered. How can one twin sister do so many annoying things? 

She gave Mr. Wood one last glance. He was propped in the chair in 
front of the window, his hands carefully placed in his lap, his white 
sneakers hanging over the chair edge. 

He looks like a real person, Kris thought sleepily. 

Tomorrow I’m going to check out some good joke books from the 
library at school. I can be funnier than Lindy. I know I can. 

She settled back sleepily on her pillow. I’ll be asleep as soon as we 
turn off the lights, she thought. 

A few seconds later, Lindy entered the room, wearing her nightshirt 
and carrying Slappy under one arm. “You asleep?” she asked Kris. 

“Almost,” Kris replied, yawning loudly. “I’ve been studying for the 
math final all night. Where’ve you been?” 

“Over at Alice’s,” Lindy told her, setting Slappy down in the chair 
beside Mr. Wood. “Some kids were over, and I practiced my act for them. 
They laughed so hard, I thought they’d split a gut. When Slappy and I did 
our rap routine, Alice spit her chocolate milk out her nose. What a riot!” 

“That’s nice,” Kris said without enthusiasm. “Guess you and Slappy 
are ready for Amy’s birthday party on Saturday.” 

“Yeah,” Lindy replied. She placed Slappy’s arm around Mr. Wood’s 
shoulder. “They look so cute together,” she said. Then she noticed the 
clothing neatly draped over the desk chair. “What’s that?” she asked Kris. 

Kris raised her head from the pillow to see what her sister was 
pointing at. “My outfit for tomorrow,” she told her. “We’re having a dress- 
up party in Miss Finch’s class. It’s a farewell party. For Margot. You know. 
The student teacher.” 

Lindy stared at the clothes. “Your Betsey Johnson skirt? Your silk 
blouse?” 

“We’re supposed to get really dressed up,” Kris said, yawning. “Can 
we go to sleep now?” 

“Yeah. Sure.” Lindy made her way to her bed, sat down, and clicked 
off the bed-table lamp. “Are you getting any better with Mr. Wood?” she 
asked, climbing between the sheets. 

Kris was stung by the question. It was such an obvious put-down. 
“Yeah. I’m getting really good. I did some stuff for Cody. Out in the back 
yard. Cody laughed so hard, he couldn’t breathe. Really. He was holding his 



sides. He said Mr. Wood and I should be on TV.” 

“Really?” Lindy replied after a long moment’s hesitation. “That’s 
weird. I never thought Cody had much of a sense of humor. He’s always so 
grim. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him laugh.” 

“Well, he was laughing at Mr. Wood and me,” Kris insisted, wishing 
she were a better liar. 

“Awesome,” Lindy muttered. “I can’t wait to see your act.” 

Neither can I, Kris thought glumly. 

A few seconds later, they were both asleep. 

Their mother’s voice, calling from downstairs, awoke them at seven the 
next morning. Bright, morning-orange sunlight poured in through the 
window. Kris could hear birds chirping happily in the old maple tree. 

“Rise and shine! Rise and shine!” Every morning, Mrs. Powell shouted 
up the same words. 

Kris mbbed the sleep from her eyes, then stretched her arms high over 
her head. She glanced across the room, then uttered a quiet gasp. “Hey— 
what’s going on?” She reached across to Lindy’s bed and shook Lindy by 
the shoulder. “What’s going on?” 

“Huh?” Lindy, startled, sat straight up. 

“What’s the joke? Where is he?” Kris demanded. 

“Huh?” 

Kris pointed to the chair across the room. 

Sitting straight up in the chair, Slappy grinned back at them, bathed in 
morning sunlight. 

But Mr. Wood was gone.

Kris blinked several times and pushed herself up in bed with both hands. 
Her left hand tingled. She must have been sleeping on it, she realized. 

“What? What’s wrong?” Lindy asked, her voice fogged with sleep. 

“Where’s Mr. Wood?” Kris demanded impatiently. “Where’d you put 
him?” 

“Huh? Put him?” Lindy struggled to focus her eyes. She saw Slappy 
sitting stiffly on the chair across the room. By himself. 

“It’s not funny,” Kris snapped. She climbed out of bed, pulled down 
the hem of her nightshirt, and made her way quickly to the chair in front of 
the window. “Don’t you ever get tired of playing stupid jokes?” 

“Jokes? Huh?” Lindy lowered her feet to the floor. 

Kris bent down to search the floor under the chair. Then she moved to 
the foot of the bed and got down on her knees to search under both twin 
beds. 

“Where is he, Lindy?” she asked angrily, on her knees at the foot of 
the bed. “I don’t think this is funny. I really don’t.” 

“Well, neither do I,” Lindy insisted, standing up and stretching. 

Kris climbed to her feet. Her eyes went wide as she spotted the 
missing dummy. 

“Oh!” 

Lindy followed her sister’s startled gaze. 

Mr. Wood grinned at them from the doorway. He appeared to be 
standing, his skinny legs bent at an awkward angle. 

He was wearing Kris’ dress-up clothes, the Betsey Johnson skirt and 
the silk blouse. 

Her mouth wide open in surprise, Kris made her way quickly to the 
doorway. She immediately saw that the dummy wasn’t really standing on 
his own. He had been propped up, the doorknob shoved into the opening in 
his back. 

She grabbed the dummy by the waist and pulled him away from the 
door. “My blouse. It’s all wrinkled,” she cried, holding it so Lindy could 
see. She narrowed her eyes angrily at her sister. “This was so obnoxious of 



you, Lindy.” 

“Me?” Lindy shrieked. “I swear, Kris, I didn’t do it. I slept like a rock 
last night. I didn’t move. I didn’t get up till you woke me. I didn’t do it. 
Really!” 

Kris stared hard at her sister, then lowered her eyes to the dummy. 

In her blouse and skirt, Mr. Wood grinned up at her, as if enjoying her 
bewilderment. 

“Well, Mr. Wood,” Kris said aloud, “I guess you put on my clothes and 
walked to the door all by yourself!” 

Lindy started to say something. But their mother’s voice from 
downstairs interrupted. “Are you girls going to school today? Where are 
you? You’re late!” 

“Coming!” Kris called down, casting an angry glance at Lindy. She 
carefully set Mr. Wood down on his back on her bed and pulled her skirt 
and blouse off him. She looked up to see Lindy making a mad dash across 
the hall to be first in the bathroom. 

Sighing, Kris stared down at Mr. Wood. The dummy grinned up at her, 
a mischievous grin. 

“Well? What’s going on?” she asked the dummy. “I didn’t dress you 
up and move you. And Lindy swears she didn’t do it.” 

But if we didn’t do it, she thought, who did?

“Tilt his head forward,” Lindy instructed. “That’s it. If you bounce him up 
and down a little, it’ll make it look like he’s laughing.” 

Kris obediently bounced Mr. Wood on her lap, making him laugh. 

“Don’t move his mouth so much,” Lindy told her. 

“I think you’re both crazy,” Lindy’s friend Alice said. 

“So what else is new?” Cody joked. 

All four of them were sitting in a small patch of shade under the bent 
old maple tree in the Powells’ back yard. It was a hot Saturday afternoon, 
the sun high in a pale blue sky, streaks of yellow light filtering down 
through the shifting leaves above their heads. 

Barky sniffed busily around the yard, his little tail wagging nonstop. 

Kris sat on a folding chair, which leaned back against the gnarled tree 
trunk. She had Mr. Wood on her lap. 

Lindy and Alice stood at the edge of the shade, their hands crossed 
over their chests, watching Kris’ performance with frowns of concentration 
on their faces. 

Alice was a tall, skinny girl, with straight black hair down to her 
shoulders, a snub nose, and a pretty, heart-shaped mouth. She was wearing 
white shorts and a bright blue midriff top. 

Cody was sprawled on his back in the grass, his hands behind his head, 
a long blade of grass between his teeth. 

Kris was trying to show off her ventriloquist skills. But Lindy kept 
interrupting with “helpful” suggestions. When she wasn’t making 
suggestions, Lindy was nervously glancing at her watch. She didn’t want to 
be late for her job at Amy’s birthday party at two o’clock. 

“I think you’re way weird,” Alice told Lindy. 

“Hey, no way,” Lindy replied. “Slappy is a lot of fun. And I’m going 
to make a lot of money with him. And maybe I’ll be a comedy star or 
something when I’m older.” She glanced at her watch again. 

“Well, everyone at school thinks that both of you are weird,” Alice 
said, swatting a fly off her bare arm. 

“Who cares?” Lindy replied sharply. “They’re all weird, too.” 



“And so are you,” Kris made Mr. Wood say. 

“I could see your lips move,” Lindy told Kris. 

Kris rolled her eyes. “Give me a break. You’ve been giving me a hard 
time all morning.” 

“Just trying to help,” Lindy said. “You don’t have to be so defensive, 
do you?” 

Kris uttered an angry growl. 

“Was that your stomach?” she made Mr. Wood say. 

Cody laughed. 

“At least one person thinks you’re funny,” Lindy said dryly. “But if 
you want to do parties, you really should get some better jokes.” 

Kris let the dummy slump to her lap. “I can’t find any good joke 
books,” she said dejectedly. “Where do you find your jokes?” 

A superior sneer formed on Lindy’s face. She tossed her long hair 
behind her shoulder. “I make up my own jokes,” she replied snootily. 

“You are a joke!” Cody said. 

“Ha-ha. Remind me to laugh later,” Lindy said sarcastically. 

“I can’t believe you don’t have your dummy out here,” Alice told 
Lindy. “I mean, don’t you want to rehearse for the party?” 

“No need,” Lindy replied. “I’ve got my act down. I don’t want to over¬ 
rehearse.” 

Kris groaned loudly. 

“Some of the other parents are staying at the birthday party to watch 
Slappy and me,” Lindy continued, ignoring Kris’ sarcasm. “If the kids like 
me, their parents might hire me for their parties.” 

“Maybe you and Kris should do an act together,” Alice suggested. 
“That could be really awesome.” 

“Yeah. What an act! Then there’d be four dummies!” Cody joked. 

Alice was the only one to laugh. 

Lindy made a face at Cody. “That might actually be fun,” she said 
thoughtfully. And then she added, “When Kris is ready.” 

Kris drew in her breath and prepared to make an angry reply. 

But before she could say anything, Lindy grabbed Mr. Wood from her 
hands. “Let me give you a few pointers,” Lindy said, putting one foot on 
Kris’ folding chair and arranging Mr. Wood on her lap. “You have to hold 
him up straighter, like this.” 



“Hey—give him back,” Kris demanded, reaching for her dummy. 

As she reached up, Mr. Wood suddenly lowered his head until he was 
staring down at her. “You’re a jerk!” he rasped in Kris’ face, speaking in a 
low, throaty growl. 

“Huh?” Kris pulled back in surprise. 

“You’re a stupid jerk!” Mr. Wood repeated nastily in the same harsh 
growl. 

“Lindy—stop it!” Kris cried. 

Cody and Alice both stared in openmouthed surprise. 

“Stupid moron! Get lost! Get lost, stupid jerk!” the dummy rasped in 
Kris’ face. 

“Whoa!” Cody exclaimed. 

“Make him stop!” Kris screamed at her sister. 

“I can’t!” Lindy cried in a trembling voice. Her face became pale, her 
eyes wide with fear. “I can’t make him stop, Kris! He—he’s speaking for 
himself!” 



9 


The dummy glared at Kris, its grin ugly and evil. 

“I—I can’t make him stop. I’m not doing it,” Lindy cried. Tugging 
with all her might, she pulled Mr. Wood out of Kris’ face. 

Cody and Alice flashed each other bewildered glances. 

Frightened, Kris raised herself from the folding chair and backed up 
against the tree trunk. “He—he’s talking on his own?” She stared hard at 
the grinning dummy. 

“I—I think so. I’m... all mixed up!” Lindy declared, her cheeks bright 

pink. 

Barky yipped and jumped on Lindy’s legs, trying to get her attention. 
But she kept her gaze on Kris’ frightened face. 

“This is a joke—right?” Cody asked hopefully. 

“What’s going on?” Alice demanded, her arms crossed in front of her 
chest. 

Ignoring them, Lindy handed Mr. Wood back to Kris. “Here. Take 
him. He’s yours. Maybe you can control him.” 

“But, Lindy—” Kris started to protest. 

Lindy glared at her watch. “Oh, no! The party! I’m late!” Shaking her 
head, she took off toward the house. “Later!” she called without looking 
back. 

“But Lindy—” Kris called. 

The kitchen door slammed behind Lindy. 

Holding Mr. Wood by the shoulders, Kris lowered her eyes to his face. 
He grinned up at her, a devilish grin, his eyes staring intently into hers. 

Kris swung easily, leaning back and raising her feet into the air. The chains 
squeaked with every swing. The old back yard swingset, half covered with 
mst, hadn’t been used much in recent years. 

The early evening sun was lowering itself behind the house. The 
aroma of a roasting chicken floated out from the kitchen window. Kris 
could hear her mother busy in the kitchen preparing dinner. 

Barky yapped beneath her. Kris dropped her feet to the ground and 



stopped the swing to avoid kicking him. “Dumb dog. Don’t you know you 
could get hurt?” 

She looked up to see Lindy come running up the driveway, holding 
Slappy under her arm. From the smile on Lindy’s face, Kris knew at once 
that the birthday party had been a triumph. But she had to ask anyway. 
“How’d it go?” 

“It was awesome!” Lindy exclaimed. “Slappy and I were great'.” 

Kris pulled herself off the swing and forced a smile to her face. “That’s 
nice,” she offered. 

“The kids thought we were a riot!” Lindy continued. She pulled 
Slappy up. “Didn’t they, Slappy?” 

“They liked me. Hated you!” Slappy declared in Lindy’s high-pitched 
voice. 

Kris forced a laugh. “I’m glad it went okay,” she said, trying hard to be 
a good sport. 

“I did a sing-along with Slappy, and it went over really well. Then 
Slappy and I did our rap routine. What a hit!” Lindy gushed. 

She’s spreading it on a little thick, Kris thought bitterly. Kris couldn’t 
help feeling jealous. 

“The kids all lined up to talk to Slappy,” Lindy continued. “Didn’t 
they, Slappy?” 

“Everyone loved me,” she made the dummy say. “Where’s my share of 
the loot?” 

“So you got paid twenty dollars?” Kris asked, kicking at a clump of 
weeds. 

“Twenty-five,” Lindy replied. “Amy’s mom said I was so good, she’d 
pay me extra. Oh. And guess what else? You know Mrs. Evans? The 
woman who always wears the leopardskin pants? You know—Anna’s 
mom? She asked me to do Anna’s party next Sunday. She’s going to pay me 
thirty dollars! I’m going to be rich!” 

“Wow. Thirty dollars,” Kris muttered, shaking her head. 

“I get twenty. You get ten,” Lindy made Slappy say. 

“I have to go tell Mom the good news!” Lindy said. “What have you 
been doing all afternoon?” 

“Well, after you left, I was pretty upset,” Kris replied, following Lindy 
to the house. “You know. About Mr. Wood. I—I put him upstairs. Alice and 



Cody went home. Then Mom and I went to the mall.” 

His tail wagging furiously, Barky ran right over their feet, nearly 
tripping both of them. “Barky, look out!” Lindy yelled. 

“Oh. I nearly forgot,” Kris said, stopping on the back stoop. 
“Something good happened.” 

Lindy stopped, too. “Something good?” 

“Yeah. I ran into Mrs. Berman at the mall.” Mrs. Berman was their 
music teacher and organizer of the spring concert. 

“Thrills,” Lindy replied sarcastically. 

“And Mrs. Berman asked if Mr. Wood and I wanted to be master of 
ceremonies for the spring concert.” Kris smiled at her sister. 

Lindy swallowed hard. “She asked you to host the concert?” 

“Yeah. I get to perform with Mr. Wood in front of everyone!” Kris 
gushed happily. She saw a flash of jealousy on Lindy’s face, which made 
her even happier. 

Lindy pulled open the screen door. “Well, good luck,” she said dryly. 
“With that weird dummy of yours, you’ll need it.” 

Dinner was spent talking about Lindy’s performance at Amy Marshall’s 
birthday party. Lindy and Mrs. Powell chatted excitedly. Kris ate in silence. 

“At first I thought the whole thing was strange, I have to admit,” Mrs. 
Powell said, scooping ice cream into bowls for dessert. “I just couldn’t 
believe you’d be interested in ventriloquism, Lindy. But I guess you have a 
flair for it. I guess you have some talent.” 

Lindy beamed. Mrs. Powell normally wasn’t big on compliments. 

“I found a book in the school library about ventriloquism,” Lindy said. 
“It had some pretty good tips in it. It even had a comedy routine to 
perform.” She glanced at Kris. “But I like making up my own jokes better.” 

“You should watch your sister’s act,” Mrs. Powell told Kris, handing 
her a bowl of ice cream. “I mean, you could probably pick up some pointers 
for the concert at school.” 

“Maybe,” Kris replied, trying to hide how annoyed she was. 

After dinner, Mr. Powell called from Portland, and they all talked with 
him. Lindy told him about her success with Slappy at the birthday party. 
Kris told him about being asked to host the concert with Mr. Wood. Her 
father promised he wouldn’t schedule any road trips so that he could attend 



the concert. 

After watching a video their mother had rented at the mall, the two 
sisters went up to their room. It was a little after eleven. 

Kris clicked on the light. Lindy followed her in. 

They both glanced across the room to the chair where they kept the 
two dummies—and gasped. 

“Oh, no!” Lindy cried, raising one hand to her wide open mouth. 

Earlier that night, the dummies had been placed side by side in a 
sitting position. 

But now Slappy was upside down, falling out of the chair, his head on 
the floor. His brown shoes had been pulled off his feet and tossed against 
the wall. His suit jacket had been pulled halfway down his arms, trapping 
his hands behind his back. 

“L-look!” Kris stammered, although her sister was already staring in 
horror at the scene. “Mr. Wood—he’s...” Kris’ voice caught in her throat. 

Mr. Wood was sprawled on top of Slappy. His hands were wrapped 
around Slappy’s throat, as if he were strangling him. 



10 


“I—I don’t believe this!” Kris managed to whisper. She turned and caught 
the frightened expression on Lindy’s face. 

“What’s going on?” Lindy cried. 

Both sisters hurried across the room. Kris grabbed Mr. Wood by the 
back of the neck and pulled him off the other dummy. She felt as if she 
were separating two fighting boys. 

She held Mr. Wood up in front of her, examining him carefully, staring 
at his face as if half-expecting him to talk to her. 

Then she lowered the dummy and tossed it facedown onto her bed. 
Her face was pale and taut with fear. 

Lindy stooped and picked up Slappy’s brown shoes from the floor. She 
held them up and studied them, as if they would offer a clue as to what had 
happened. 

“Kris—did you do this?” Lindy asked softly. 

“Huh? Me?” Kris reacted with surprise. 

“I mean, I know you’re jealous of Slappy and me—” Lindy started. 

“Whoa. Wait a minute,” Kris replied angrily in a shrill, trembling 
voice. “I didn’t do this, Lindy. Don’t accuse me.” 

Lindy glared at her sister, studying her face. Then her expression 
softened and she sighed. “I don’t get. I just don’t get it. Look at Slappy. 
He’s nearly been torn apart.” 

She set the shoes down on the chair and picked the dummy up gently 
as if picking up a baby. Holding him in one hand, she struggled to pull his 
suit jacket up with the other. 

Kris heard her sister mutter something. It sounded like “Your dummy 
is evil.” 

“What did you say?” Kris demanded. 

“Nothing,” Lindy replied, still struggling with the jacket. “I’m... uh... 
I’m kind of scared about this,” Lindy confessed, blushing, avoiding Kris’ 
eyes. 

“Me, too,” Kris admitted. “Something weird is going on. I think we 
should tell Mom.” 



Lindy buttoned the jacket. Then she sat down on the bed with Slappy 
on her lap and started to replace the dummy’s shoes. “Yeah. I guess we 
should,” she replied. “It—it’s just so creepy.” 

Their mother was in bed, reading a Stephen King novel. Her bedroom 
was dark except for a tiny reading lamp on her headboard that threw down a 
narrow triangle of yellow light. 

Mrs. Powell uttered a short cry as her two daughters appeared out of 
the shadows. “Oh. You startled me. This is such a scary book, and I think I 
was just about to fall asleep.” 

“Can we talk to you?” Kris asked eagerly in a low whisper. 

“Something weird is going on,” Lindy added. 

Mrs. Powell yawned and closed her book. “What’s wrong?” 

“It’s about Mr. Wood,” Kris said. “He’s been doing a lot of strange 
things.” 

“Huh?” Mrs. Powell’s eyes opened wide. She looked pale and tired 
under the harsh light from the reading lamp. 

“He was strangling Slappy,” Lindy reported. “And this afternoon, he 
said some really gross things. And—” 

“Stop!” Mrs. Powell ordered, raising one hand. “Just stop.” 

“But, Mom—” Kris started. 

“Give me a break, girls,” their mother said wearily. “I’m tired of your 
silly competitions.” 

“You don’t understand,” Lindy interrupted. 

“Yes, I do understand,” Mrs. Powell said sharply. “You two are even 
competing with those ventriloquist dummies.” 

“Mom, please!” 

“I want it to stop right now,” Mrs. Powell insisted, tossing the book 
onto her bed table. “I mean it. I don’t want to hear another word from either 
of you about those dummies. If you two have problems, settle it between 
yourselves.” 

“Mom, listen—” 

“And if you can’t settle it, I’ll take the dummies away. Both of them. 
I’m serious.” Mrs. Powell reached above her head and clicked off the 
reading light, throwing the room into darkness. “Good night,” she said. 

The girls had no choice but to leave the room. They slunk down the 
hall in silence. 



Kris hesitated at the doorway to their bedroom. She expected to find 
Mr. Wood strangling Slappy again. She breathed a sigh of relief when she 
saw the two dummies on the bed where they had been left. 

“Mom wasn’t too helpful,” Lindy said dryly, rolling her eyes. She 
picked up Slappy and started to arrange him in the chair in front of the 
window. 

“I think she was asleep and we woke her up,” Kris replied. 

She picked up Mr. Wood and started toward the chair with him—then 
stopped. “You know what? I think I’m going to put him in the closet 
tonight,” she said thoughtfully. 

“Good idea,” Lindy said, climbing into bed. 

Kris glanced down at the dummy, half-expecting him to react. To 
complain. To start calling her names. 

But Mr. Wood grinned up at her, his painted eyes dull and lifeless. 

Kris felt a chill of fear. 

I’m becoming afraid of a stupid ventriloquist’s dummy, she thought. 

I’m shutting him up in the closet tonight because I’m afraid. 

She carried Mr. Wood to the closet. Then, with a groan, she raised him 
high above her head and slid him onto the top shelf. Carefully closing the 
closet door, listening for the click, she made her way to her bed. 

She slept fitfully, tossing on top of the covers, her sleep filled with 
disturbing dreams. She awoke to find her nightshirt completely twisted, 
cutting off the circulation to her right arm. She struggled to straighten it, 
then fell back to sleep. 

She awoke early, drenched in sweat. The sky was still dawn-gray outside 
the window. 

The room felt hot and stuffy. She sat up slowly, feeling weary, as if she 
hadn’t slept at all. 

Blinking away the sleep, her eyes focused on the chair in front of the 
window. 

There sat Slappy, exactly where Lindy had placed him. 

And beside him sat Mr. Wood, his arm around Slappy’s shoulder, 
grinning triumphantly at Kris as if he had just pulled off a wonderful joke. 



11 


“Now, Mr. Wood, do you go to school?” 

“Of course I do. Do you think I’m a dummy?” 

“And what’s your favorite class?” 

“Wood shop, of course!” 

“What project are you building in shop class, Mr. Wood?” 

“I’m building a girl dummy! What else? Ha-ha! Think I want to spend 
the rest of my life on your lap?!” 

Kris sat in front of the dressing table mirror with Mr. Wood on her lap, 
studying herself as she practiced her routine for the school concert. 

Mr. Wood had been well-behaved for two days. No frightening, 
mysterious incidents. Kris was beginning to feel better. Maybe everything 
would go okay from now on. 

She leaned close to the mirror, watching her lips as she made the 
dummy talk. 

The b’s and the m’s were impossible to pronounce without moving her 
lips. She’d just have to avoid those sounds as best she could. 

I’m getting better at switching from Mr. Wood’s voice back to mine, 
she thought happily. But I’ve got to switch faster. The faster he and I talk, 
the funnier it is. 

“Let’s try it again, Mr. Wood,” she said, pulling her chair closer to the 
mirror. 

“Work, work, work,” she made the dummy grumble. 

Before she could begin the routine, Lindy came rushing breathlessly 
into the room. Kris watched her sister in the mirror as she came up behind 
her, her long hair flying loosely over her shoulders, an excited smile on her 
face. 

“Guess what?” Lindy asked. 

Kris started to reply, but Lindy didn’t give her a chance. 

“Mrs. Petrie was at Amy Marshall’s birthday party,” Lindy gushed 
excitedly. “She works for Channel Three. You know. The TV station. And 
she thinks I’m good enough to go on Talent Search, the show they have 
every week.” 



“Huh? Really?” was all Kris could manage in reply. 

Lindy leapt excitedly in the air and cheered. “Slappy and I are going to 
be on TV!” she cried. “Isn’t that fabulous ?” 

Staring at her sister’s jubilant reflection in the mirror, Kris felt a stab 
of jealousy. 

“I’ve got to tell Mom!” Lindy declared. “Hey, Mom! Mom!” She ran 
from the room. Kris heard her shouting all the way down the stairs. 

“Aaaaaargh!” Kris couldn’t hold it in. She uttered an angry cry. 

“Why does everything good happen to Lindy?” Kris screamed aloud. 
“I’m hosting a stupid concert for maybe a hundred parents—and she’s 
going to be on TV! I’m just as good as she is. Maybe better!” 

In a rage, she raised Mr. Wood high over her head and slammed him to 
the floor. 

The dummy’s head made a loud clonk as it hit the hardwood floor. The 
wide mouth flew open as if about to scream. 

“Oh.” Kris struggled to regain her composure. 

Mr. Wood, crumpled at her feet, stared up at her accusingly. 

Kris lifted him up and cradled the dummy against her. “There, there, 
Mr. Wood,” she whispered soothingly. “Did I hurt you? Did I? I’m so sorry. 
I didn’t mean to.” 

The dummy continued to stare up at her. His painted grin hadn’t 
changed, but his eyes seemed cold and unforgiving. 

It was a still night. No breeze. The curtains in front of the open bedroom 
window didn’t flutter or move. Pale silver moonlight filtered in, creating 
long, purple shadows that appeared to creep across the girls’ bedroom. 

Lindy had been sleeping fitfully, a light sleep filled with busy, colorful 
dreams. She was startled awake by a sound. A gentle thud. 

“Huh?” she raised her head from the damp pillow and turned. 

Someone was moving in the darkness. 

The sounds she’d heard were footsteps. 

“Hey!” she whispered, wide awake now. “Who is it?” 

The figure turned in the doorway, a shadow against even blacker 
shadows. “It’s only me,” came a whispered reply. 

“Kris?” 

“Yeah. Something woke me up. My throat is sore,” Kris whispered 



from the doorway. “I’m going down to the kitchen for a glass of water.” 

She disappeared into the shadows. Her head still raised off the pillow, 
Lindy listened to her footsteps padding down the stairs. 

When the sounds faded, Lindy shut her eyes and lowered her head to 
the pillow. 

A few seconds later, she heard Kris’ scream of horror. 



12 


Her heart pounding, Lindy struggled out of bed. The sheet tangled around 
her legs, and she nearly fell. 

Kris’ bloodcurdling scream echoed in her ears. 

She practically leapt down the dark stairway, her bare feet thudding 
hard on the thin carpet of the steps. 

It was dark downstairs, except for a thin sliver of yellow light from the 
kitchen. 

“Kris—Kris—are you okay?” Lindy called, her voice sounding small 
and frightened in the dark hallway. 

“Kris?” 

Lindy stopped at the kitchen doorway. 

What was that eerie light? 

It took her a while to focus. Then she realized she was staring at the 
dim yellow light from inside the refrigerator. 

The refrigerator door was wide open. 

And... the refrigerator was empty. 

“What—what’s going on here?” 

She took a step into the kitchen. Then another. 

Something cold and wet surrounded her foot. 

Lindy gasped and, looking down, saw that she had stepped into a wide 
puddle. 

An overturned milk carton beside her foot revealed that the puddle was 
spilled milk. 

She raised her eyes to Kris, who was standing in darkness across the 
room, her back against the wall, her hands raised to her face in horror. 

“Kris, what on earth—” 

The scene was coming into focus now. It was all so weird, so... wrong. 
It was taking Lindy a long time to see the whole picture. 

But, now, following Kris’ horrified stare, Lindy saw the mess on the 
floor. And realized why the refrigerator was empty. 

Everything inside it had been pulled out and dumped on the kitchen 



floor. An orange juice bottle lay on its side in a puddle of orange juice. 
Eggs were scattered everywhere. Fruits and vegetables were strewn over 
the floor. 

“Ohh!” Lindy moaned in utter disbelief. 

Everything seemed to sparkle and gleam. 

What was all that shiny stuff among the food? 

Kris’jewelry! 

There were earrings and bracelets and strands of beads tossed 
everywhere, mixed with the spilled, strewn food like some kind of bizarre 
salad. 

“Oh, no!” Lindy shrieked as her eyes came to rest on the figure on the 
floor. 

Sitting upright in the middle of the mess was Mr. Wood, grinning 
gleefully at her. He had several strands of beads around his neck, long, 
dangling earrings hanging from his ears, and a platter of leftover chicken on 
his lap. 



13 


“Kris, are you okay?” Lindy cried, turning her eyes away from the grinning, 
jewelry-covered dummy. 

Kris didn’t seem to hear her. 

“Are you okay?” Lindy repeated the question. 

“Wh-what’s going on?” Kris stammered, her back pressed against the 
wall, her expression taut with terror. “Who—who did this? Did Mr. Wood 
_?” 

Lindy started to reply. But their mother’s howl of surprise from the 
doorway cut off her words. “Mom—” Lindy cried, spinning around. 

Mrs. Powell clicked on the ceiling light. The kitchen seemed to flare 
up. All three of them blinked, struggling to adjust to the sudden brightness. 

“What on earth!” Mrs. Powell cried. She started to call to her husband, 
then remembered he wasn’t home. “I—I don’t believe this!” 

Barky came bounding into the room, his tail wagging. He lowered his 
head and started to lick up some spilled milk. 

“Out you go,” Mrs. Powell said sternly. She picked up the dog, carried 
him out, and closed the kitchen door. Then she strode into the center of the 
room, shaking her head, her bare feet narrowly missing the puddle of milk. 

“I came down for a drink, and I—I found this mess,” Kris said in a 
trembling voice. “The food. My jewelry. Everything...” 

“Mr. Wood did it,” Lindy accused. “Look at him!” 

“Stop it! Stop it!” Mrs. Powell screamed. “I’ve had enough.” 

Mrs. Powell surveyed the mess, frowning and tugging at a strand of 
blonde hair. Her eyes stopped on Mr. Wood, and she uttered a groan of 
disgust. 

“I knew it,” she said in a low voice, raising her eyes accusingly to the 
two girls. “I knew this had something to do with those ventriloquist 
dummies.” 

“Mr. Wood did it, Mom,” Kris said heatedly, stepping away from the 
wall, her hands tensed into fists. “I know it sounds dumb, but—” 

“Stop it,” Mrs. Powell ordered, narrowing her eyes. “This is just sick. 
Sick!” She stared hard at the jewel-bedecked dummy, who grinned up at her 



over the big platter of chicken. 

“I’m going to take the dummies away from you both,” Mrs. Powell 
said, turning back to Lindy and Kris. “This whole thing has just gotten out 
of control.” 

“No!” Kris cried. 

“That’s not fair!” Lindy declared. 

“I’m sorry. They have to be put away,” Mrs. Powell said firmly. She let 
her eyes move over the cluttered floor, and let out another weary sigh. 
“Look at my kitchen.” 

“But I didn’t do anything!” Lindy screamed. 

“I need Mr. Wood for the spring concert!” Kris protested. “Everyone is 
counting on me, Mom.” 

Mrs. Powell glanced from one to the other. Her eyes stayed on Kris. 
“That’s your dummy on the floor, right?” 

“Yeah,” Kris told her. “But I didn’t do this. I swear!” 

“You both swear you didn’t do it, right?” Mrs. Powell said, suddenly 
looking very tired under the harsh ceiling light. 

“Yes,” Lindy answered quickly. 

“Then you both lose your dummies. I’m sorry,” Mrs. Powell said. 
“One of you is lying. I—I really can’t believe this.” 

A heavy silence blanketed the room as all three Powells stared down in 
dismay at the mess on the floor. 

Kris was the first to speak. “Mom, what if Lindy and I clean 
everything up?” 

Lindy caught on quickly. Her face brightened. “Yeah. What if we put 
everything back. Right now. Make the kitchen just like normal. Make it 
spotless. Can we keep our dummies?” 

Mrs. Powell shook her head. “No. I don’t think so. Look at this mess. 
All the vegetables are spoiled. And the milk.” 

“We’ll replace it all,” Kris said quickly. “With our allowance. And 
we’ll clean it up perfectly. Please. If we do that, give us one more chance?” 

Mrs. Powell twisted her face in concentration, debating with herself. 
She stared at her daughters’ eager faces. “Okay,” she replied finally. “I want 
the kitchen spotless when I come down in the morning. All the food, all the 
jewelry. Everything back where it goes.” 

“Okay,” both girls said in unison. 



“And I don’t want to see either of those dummies down here in my 
kitchen again,” Mrs. Powell demanded. “If you can do that, I’ll give you 
one more chance.” 

“Great!” both girls cried at once. 

“And I don’t want to hear any more arguments about those dummies,” 
Mrs. Powell continued. “No more fights. No more competing. No more 
blaming everything on the dummies. I don’t want to hear anything about 
them. Ever.” 

“You won’t,” Kris promised, glancing at her sister. 

“Thanks, Mom,” Lindy said. “You go to bed. We’ll clean up.” She 
gave her mother a gentle shove toward the doorway. 

“Not another word,” Mrs. Powell reminded them. 

“Right, Mom,” the twins agreed. 

Their mother disappeared toward her room. They began to clean up. 
Kris pulled a large garbage bag from the drawer and held it while Lindy 
tossed in empty cartons and spoiled food. 

Kris carefully collected her jewelry and carried it upstairs. 

Neither girl spoke. They worked in silence, picking up, cleaning, and 
mopping until the kitchen was clean. Lindy closed the refrigerator door. She 
yawned loudly. 

Kris inspected the floor on her hands and knees, making sure it was 
spotless. Then she picked up Mr. Wood. He grinned back at her as if it was 
all a big joke. 

This dummy has been nothing but trouble, Kris thought. 

Nothing but trouble. 

She followed Lindy out of the kitchen, clicking off the light as she left. 
The two girls climbed the stairs silently. Neither of them had spoken a 
word. 

Pale moonlight filtered into their room through the open window. The 
air felt hot and steamy. 

Kris glanced at the clock. It was a little past three in the morning. 

Slappy sat slumped in the chair in front of the window, moonlight 
shining on his grinning face. Lindy, yawning, climbed into bed, pushed 
down the blanket, and pulled up the sheet. She turned her face away from 
her sister. 

Kris lowered Mr. Wood from her shoulder. You’re nothing but trouble, 



she thought angrily, holding him in front of her and staring at his grinning 
face. 

Nothing but trouble. 

Mr. Wood’s wide, leering grin seemed to mock her. 

A chill of fear mixed with her anger. 

I’m beginning to hate this dummy, she thought. 

Fear him and hate him. 

Angrily, she pulled open the closet door and tossed the dummy into the 
closet. It fell in a crumpled heap on the closet floor. 

Kris slammed the closet door shut. 

Her heart thudding, she climbed into bed and pulled up the covers. She 
suddenly felt very tired. Her entire body ached from weariness. 

She buried her face in the pillow and shut her eyes. 

She had just about fallen asleep when she heard the tiny voice. 

“Let me out! Let me out of here!” it cried. A muffled voice, coming 
from inside the closet. 



14 


“Let me out! Let me out!” the high-pitched voice called angrily. 

Kris sat up with a jolt. Her entire body convulsed in a shudder of fear. 

Her eyes darted to the other bed. Lindy hadn’t moved. 

“Did—did you hear it?” Kris stammered. 

“Hear what?” Lindy asked sleepily. 

“The voice,” Kris whispered. “In the closet.” 

“Huh?” Lindy asked sleepily. “What are you talking about? It’s three 
in the morning. Can’t we get some sleep?” 

“But, Lindy—” Kris lowered her feet to the floor. Her heart was 
thudding in her chest. “Wake up. Listen to me! Mr. Wood was calling to me. 
He was talking !” 

Lindy raised her head and listened. 

Silence. 

“I don’t hear anything, Kris. Really. Maybe you were dreaming.” 

“No!” Kris shrieked, feeling herself lose control. “It wasn’t a dream! 
I’m so scared, Lindy. I’m just so scared !” 

Suddenly Kris was trembling all over, and hot tears were pouring 
down her cheeks. 

Lindy stood up and moved to the edge of her sister’s bed. 

“Something h-horrible is going on here, Lindy,” Kris stammered 
through her tears. 

“And I know who’s doing it,” Lindy whispered, leaning over her twin, 
putting a comforting hand on her quivering shoulder. 

“Huh?” 

“Yes. I know who’s been doing it all,” Lindy whispered. “I know who 
it is.” 


“Who?” Kris asked breathlessly. 



15 


“Who?” Kris repeated, letting the tears run down her cheeks. “Who?” 

“I have,” Lindy said. Her smile spread into a grin almost as wide as 
Slappy’s. She closed her eyes and laughed. 

“Huh?” Kris didn’t understand. “What did you say?” 

“I said I have been doing it,” Lindy repeated. “Me. Lindy. It was all a 
joke, Kris. I gotcha again.” She nodded her head as if confirming her 
words. 

Kris gaped at her twin in disbelief. “It was all a joke?” 

Lindy kept nodding. 

“You moved Mr. Wood during the night? You dressed him in my 
clothes and made him say those gross things to me? You put him in the 
kitchen? You made that horrible mess?” 

Lindy chuckled. “Yeah. I really scared you, didn’t I?” 

Kris balled her hands into angry fists. “But—but—” she sputtered. 
“Why?” 

“For fun,” Lindy replied, dropping back onto her bed, still grinning. 

“Fun?” 

“I wanted to see if I could scare you,” Lindy explained. “It was just a 
joke. You know. I can’t believe you fell for that voice in the closet just now! 
I must be a really good ventriloquist!” 

“But, Lindy—” 

“You really believed Mr. Wood was alive or something!” Lindy said, 
laughing, enjoying her victory. “You’re such a nit!” 

“Nit?” 

“Half a nitwit!” Lindy burst into wild laughter. 

“It isn’t funny,” Kris said softly. 

“I know,” Lindy replied. “It’s a riot! You should’ve seen the look on 
your face when you saw Mr. Wood downstairs in your precious beads and 
earrings!” 

“How—how did you ever think of such a mean joke?” Kris demanded. 

“It just came to me,” Lindy answered with some pride. “When you got 
your dummy.” 



“You didn’t want me to get a dummy,” Kris said thoughtfully. 

“You’re right,” Lindy quickly agreed. “I wanted something that would 
be mine, for a change. I’m so tired of you being a copycat. So—” 

“So you thought of this mean joke,” Kris accused. 

Lindy nodded. 

Kris strode angrily to the window and pressed her forehead against the 
glass. “I—I can’t believe I was so stupid,” she muttered. 

“Neither can I,” Lindy agreed, grinning again. 

“You really made me start thinking that Mr. Wood was alive or 
something,” Kris said, staring out the window to the back yard below. “You 
really made me afraid of him.” 

“Aren’t I brilliant!” Lindy proclaimed. 

Kris turned to face her sister. “I’m never speaking to you again,” she 
said angrily. 

Lindy shrugged. “It was just a joke.” 

“No,” Kris insisted. “It was too mean to be just a joke. I’m never 
speaking to you again. Never.” 

“Fine,” Lindy replied curtly. “I thought you had a sense of humor. 
Fine.” She slid into bed, her back to Kris, and pulled the covers up over her 
head. 

I’ve got to find a way to pay her back for this, Kris thought. But how? 



16 


After school a few days later, Kris walked home with Cody. It was a hot, 
humid afternoon. The trees were still, and seemed to throw little shade on 
the sidewalk. The air above the pavement shimmered in the heat. 

“Wish we had a swimming pool,” Kris muttered, pulling her backpack 
off her shoulder. 

“I wish you had one, too,” Cody said, wiping his forehead with the 
sleeve of his red T-shirt. 

“I’d like to dive into an enormous pool of iced tea,” Kris said, “like in 
the TV commercials. It always looks so cold and refreshing.” 

Cody made a face. “Swim in iced tea? With ice cubes and lemon?” 

“Forget it,” Kris muttered. 

They crossed the street. A couple of kids they knew rode by on bikes. 
Two men in white uniforms were up on ladders, leaning against the corner 
house, painting the gutters. 

“Bet they’re hot,” Cody remarked. 

“Let’s change the subject,” Kris suggested. 

“How are you doing with Mr. Wood?” Cody asked. 

“Not bad,” Kris said. “I think I’ve got some pretty good jokes. I should 
be ready for the concert tomorrow night.” 

They stopped at the corner and let a large blue van rumble past. 

“Are you talking to your sister?” Cody asked as they crossed the street. 
The bright sunlight made his white-blond hair glow. 

“A little,” Kris said, making a face. “I’m talking to her. But I haven’t 
forgiven her.” 

“That was such a dumb stunt she pulled,” Cody said sympathetically. 
He wiped the sweat off his forehead with the sleeve of his T-shirt. 

“It just made me feel like such a dork,” Kris admitted. “I mean, I was 
so stupid. She really had me believing that Mr. Wood was doing all that 
stuff.” Kris shook her head. Thinking about it made her feel embarrassed all 
over again. 

Her house came into view. She unzipped the back compartment of her 
backpack and searched for the keys. 



“Did you tell your mom about Lindy’s practical joke?” Cody asked. 

Kris shook her head. “Mom is totally disgusted. We’re not allowed to 
mention the dummies to her. Dad got home from Portland last night, and 
Mom told him what was going on. So we’re not allowed to mention the 
dummies to him, either!” She found the keys and started up the drive. 
“Thanks for walking home with me.” 

“Yeah. Sure.” Cody gave her a little wave and continued on toward his 
house up the street. 

Kris pushed the key into the front door lock. She could hear Barky 
jumping and yipping excitedly on the other side of the door. “I’m coming, 
Barky,” she called in. “Hold your horses.” 

She pushed open the door. Barky began leaping on her, whimpering as 
if she’d been away for months. “Okay, okay!” she cried laughing. 

It took several minutes to calm the dog down. Then Kris got a snack 
from the kitchen and headed up to her room to practice with Mr. Wood. 

She hoisted the dummy up from the chair where it had spent the day 
beside Lindy’s dummy. A can of Coke in one hand, the dummy over her 
shoulder, she headed to the dressing table and sat down in front of the 
mirror. 

This was the best time of day to rehearse, Kris thought. No one was 
home. Her parents were at work. Lindy was at some after-school activity. 

She arranged Mr. Wood on her lap. “Time to go to work,” she made 
him say, reaching into his back to move his lips. She made his eyes slide 
back and forth. 

A button on his plaid shirt had come unbuttoned. Kris leaned him 
down against the dressing table and started to fasten it. 

Something caught her eye. Something yellow inside the pocket. 

“Weird,” Kris said aloud. “I never noticed anything in there.” 

Slipping two fingers into the slender pocket, she pulled out a yellowed 
sheet of paper, folded up. 

Probably just the receipt for him, Kris thought. 

She unfolded the sheet of paper and held it up to read it. 

It wasn’t a receipt. The paper contained a single sentence handwritten 
very cleanly in bold black ink. It was in a language Kris didn’t recognize. 
“Did someone send you a love note, Mr. Wood?” she asked the dummy. 

It stared up at her lifelessly. 



Kris lowered her eyes to the paper and read the strange sentence out 

loud: 

“Kami marri odonna loma molonu karrano.” 

What language is that? Kris wondered. 

She glanced down at the dummy and uttered a low cry of surprise. 

Mr. Wood appeared to blink. 

But that wasn’t possible —was it? 

Kris took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. 

The dummy stared up at her, his painted eyes as dull and wide open as 

ever. 

Let’s not get paranoid, Kris scolded herself. 

“Time to work, Mr. Wood,” she told him. She folded up the piece of 
yellow paper and slipped it back into his shirt pocket. Then she raised him 
to a sitting position, searching for the eye and mouth controls with her 
hand. 

“How are things around your house, Mr. Wood?” 

“Not good, Kris. I’ve got termites. I need termites like I need another 
hole in my head! Ha-ha!” 

“Lindy! Kris! Could you come downstairs, please!” Mr. Powell called from 
the foot of the stairs. 

It was after dinner, and the twins were up in their room. Lindy was 
sprawled on her stomach on the bed, reading a book for school. Kris was in 
front of the dressing table mirror, rehearsing quietly with Mr. Wood for 
tomorrow night’s concert. 

“What do you want, Dad?” Lindy shouted down, rolling her eyes. 
“We’re kind of busy,” Kris shouted, shifting the dummy on her lap. 
“The Millers are here, and they’re dying to see your ventriloquist 
acts,” their father shouted up. 

Lindy and Kris both groaned. The Millers were the elderly couple who 
lived next door. They were very nice people, but very boring. 

The twins heard Mr. Powell’s footsteps on the stairs. A few seconds 
later, he poked his head into their room. “Come on, girls. Just put on a short 
show for the Millers. They came over for coffee, and we told them about 
your dummies.” 

“But I have to rehearse for tomorrow night,” Kris insisted. 



“Rehearse on them,” her father suggested. “Come on. Just do five 
minutes. They’ll get a real kick out of it.” 

Sighing loudly, the girls agreed. Carrying their dummies over their 
shoulders, they followed their father down to the living room. 

Mr. and Mrs. Miller were side by side on the couch, coffee mugs in 
front of them on the low coffee table. They smiled and called out cheerful 
greetings as the girls appeared. 

Kris was always struck by how much the Millers looked alike. They 
both had slender, pink faces topped with spongy white hair. They both wore 
silver-framed bifocals, which slipped down on nearly identical, pointy 
noses. They both had the same smile. Mr. Miller had a small, gray 
mustache. Lindy always joked that he grew it so the Millers could tell each 
other apart. 

Is that what happens to you when you’ve been married a long time? 
Kris found herself thinking. You start to look exactly alike? 

The Millers were even dressed alike, in loose-fitting tan Bermuda 
shorts and white cotton sports shirts. 

“Lindy and Kris took up ventriloquism a few weeks ago,” Mrs. Powell 
was explaining, twisting herself forward to see the girls from the armchair. 
She motioned them to the center of the room. “And they both seem to have 
some talent for it.” 

“Have you girls ever heard of Bergen and McCarthy?” Mrs. Miller 
asked, smiling. 

“Who?” Lindy and Kris asked in unison. 

“Before your time,” Mr. Miller said, chuckling. “They were a 
ventriloquist act.” 

“Can you do something for us?” Mrs. Miller asked, picking up her 
coffee mug and setting it in her lap. 

Mr. Powell pulled a dining room chair into the center of the room. 
“Here. Lindy, why don’t you go first?” He turned to the Millers. “They’re 
very good. You’ll see,” he said. 

Lindy sat down and arranged Slappy on her lap. The Millers 
applauded. Mrs. Miller nearly spilled her coffee, but she caught the mug 
just in time. 

“Don’t applaud—just throw money!” Lindy made Slappy say. 
Everyone laughed as if they’d never heard that before. 



Kris watched from the stairway as Lindy did a short routine. Lindy 
was really good, she had to admit. Very smooth. The Millers were laughing 
so hard, their faces were bright red. An identical shade of red. Mrs. Miller 
kept squeezing her husband’s knee when she laughed. 

Lindy finished to big applause. The Millers gushed about how 
wonderful she was. Lindy told them about the TV show she might be on, 
and they promised they wouldn’t miss it. “We’ll tape it,” Mr. Miller said. 

Kris took her place on the chair and sat Mr. Wood up in her lap. “This 
is Mr. Wood,” she told the Millers. “We’re going to be the hosts of the 
spring concert at school tomorrow night. So I’ll give you a preview of what 
we’re going to say.” 

“That’s a nice-looking dummy,” Mrs. Miller said quietly. 

“You’re a nice-looking dummy, too!” Mr. Wood declared in a harsh, 
raspy growl of a voice. 

Kris’ mother gasped. The Millers’ smiles faded. 

Mr. Wood leaned forward on Kris’ lap and stared at Mr. Miller. “Is that 
a mustache, or are you eating a rat?” he asked nastily. 

Mr. Miller glanced uncomfortably at his wife, then forced a laugh. 
They both laughed. 

“Don’t laugh so hard. You might drop your false teeth!” Mr. Wood 
shouted. “And how do you get your teeth that disgusting shade of yellow? 
Does your bad breath do that?” 

“Kris!” Mrs. Powell shouted. “That’s enough!” 

The Millers’ faces were bright red now, their expressions bewildered. 

“That’s not funny. Apologize to the Millers,” Mr. Powell insisted, 
crossing the room and standing over Kris. 

“I—I didn’t say any of it!” Kris stammered. “Really, I—” 

“Kris—apologize!” her father demanded angrily. 

Mr. Wood turned to the Millers. “I’m sorry,” he rasped. “I’m sorry 
you’re so ugly! I’m sorry you’re so old and stupid, too!” 

The Millers stared at each other unhappily. “I don’t get her humor,” 
Mrs. Miller said. 

“It’s just crude insults,” Mr. Miller replied quietly. 

“Kris—what is wrong with you?” Mrs. Powell demanded. She had 
crossed the room to stand beside her husband. “Apologize to the Millers 
right now! I don’t believe you!” 



“I—I—” Gripping Mr. Wood tightly around the waist, Kris rose to her 
feet. “I—I—” She tried to utter an apology, but no words would come out. 

“Sorry!” she finally managed to scream. Then, with an embarrassed 
cry, she turned and fled up the stairs, tears streaming down her face. 



17 


“You have to believe me!” Kris cried in a trembling voice. “I really didn’t 
say any of those things. Mr. Wood was talking by himself!” 

Lindy rolled her eyes. “Tell me another one,” she muttered 
sarcastically. 

Lindy had followed Kris upstairs. Down in the living room, her 
parents were still apologizing to the Millers. Now, Kris sat on the edge of 
her bed, wiping tears off her cheeks. Lindy stood with her arms crossed in 
front of the dressing table. 

“I don’t make insulting jokes like that,” Kris said, glancing at Mr. 
Wood, who lay crumpled in the center of the floor where Kris had tossed 
him. “You know that isn’t my sense of humor.” 

“So why’d you do it?” Lindy demanded. “Why’d you want to make 
everyone mad?” 

“But I didn’t!” Kris shrieked, tugging at the sides of her hair. “Mr. 
Wood said those things! I didn’t!” 

“How can you be such a copycat?” Lindy asked disgustedly. “I already 
did that joke, Kris. Can’t you think of something original?” 

“It’s not a joke,” Kris insisted. “Why don’t you believe me?” 

“No way,” Lindy replied, shaking her head, her arms still crossed in 
front of her chest. “No way I’m going to fall for the same gag.” 

“Lindy, please!” Kris pleaded. “I’m frightened. I’m really frightened.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Lindy said sarcastically. “I’m shaking all over, too. 
Wow. You really fooled me, Kris. Guess you showed me you can play 
funny tricks, too.” 

“Shut up!” Kris snapped. More tears formed in the corners of her eyes. 

“Very good crying,” Lindy said. “But it doesn’t fool me, either. And it 
won’t fool Mom and Dad.” She turned and picked up Slappy. “Maybe 
Slappy and I should practice some jokes. After your performance tonight, 
Mom and Dad might not let you do the concert tomorrow night.” 

She slung Slappy over her shoulder and, stepping over the crumpled 
form of Mr. Wood, hurried from the room. 



It was hot and noisy backstage in the auditorium. Kris’ throat was dry, and 
she kept walking over to the water fountain and slurping mouthfuls of the 
warm water. 

The voices of the audience on the other side of the curtain seemed to 
echo off all four walls and the ceiling. The louder the noise became as the 
auditorium filled, the more nervous Kris felt. 

How am I ever going to do my act in front of all those people? she 
asked herself, pulling the edge of the curtain back a few inches and peering 
out. Her parents were off to the side, in the third row. 

Seeing them brought memories of the night before flooding back to 
Kris. Her parents had grounded her for two weeks as punishment for 
insulting the Millers. They almost hadn’t let her come to the concert. 

Kris stared at the kids and adults filing into the large auditorium, 
recognizing a lot of faces. She realized her hands were ice cold. Her throat 
was dry again. 

Don’t think of it as an audience, she told herself. Think of it as a bunch 
of kids and parents, most of whom you know. 

Somehow that made it worse. 

She let go of the curtain, hurried to get one last drink from the 
fountain, then retrieved Mr. Wood from the table she had left him on. 

It suddenly grew quiet on the other side of the curtain. The concert was 
about to begin. 

“Break a leg!” Lindy called across to her as she hurried to join the 
other chorus members. 

“Thanks,” Kris replied weakly. She pulled up Mr. Wood and 
straightened his shirt. “Your hands are clammy!” she made him say. 

“No insults tonight,” Kris told him sternly. 

To her shock, the dummy blinked. 

“Hey!” she cried. She hadn’t touched his eye controls. 

She had a stab of fear that went beyond stage fright. Maybe I shouldn’t 
go on with this, she thought, staring intently at Mr. Wood, watching for him 
to blink again. 

Maybe I should say I’m sick and not perform with him. 

“Are you nervous?” a voice whispered. 

“Huh?” At first, she thought it was Mr. Wood. But then she quickly 
realized that it was Mrs. Berman, the music teacher. 



“Yeah. A little,” Kris admitted, feeling her face grow hot. 

“You’ll be terrific,” Mrs. Berman gushed, squeezing Kris’ shoulder 
with a sweaty hand. She was a large, heavyset woman with several chins, a 
red lipsticked mouth, and flowing black hair. She was wearing a long, 
loose-fitting dress of red-and-blue flower patterns. “Here goes,” she said, 
giving Kris’ shoulder one more squeeze. 

Then she stepped onstage, blinking against the harsh white light of the 
spotlight, to introduce Kris and Mr. Wood. 

Am I really doing this? Kris asked herself. 

Can I do this? 

Her heart was pounding so hard, she couldn’t hear Mrs. Berman’s 
introduction. Then, suddenly, the audience was applauding, and Kris found 
herself walking across the stage to the microphone, carrying Mr. Wood in 
both hands. 

Mrs. Berman, her flowery dress flowing around her, was heading 
offstage. She smiled at Kris and gave her an encouraging wink as they 
passed each other. 

Squinting against the bright spotlight, Kris walked to the middle of the 
stage. Her mouth felt as dry as cotton. She wondered if she could make a 
sound. 

A folding chair had been set up for her. She sat down, arranging Mr. 
Wood on her lap, then realized that the microphone was much too high. 

This drew titters of soft laughter from the audience. 

Embarrassed, Kris stood up and, holding Mr. Wood under one arm, 
struggled to lower the microphone. 

“Are you having trouble?” Mrs. Berman called from the side of the 
stage. She hurried over to help Kris. 

But before the music teacher got halfway across the stage, Mr. Wood 
leaned into the microphone. “What time does the blimp go up?” he rasped 
nastily, staring at Mrs. Berman’s dress. 

“What?” She stopped in surprise. 

“Your face reminds me of a wart I had removed!” Mr. Wood growled 
at the startled woman. 

Her mouth dropped open in horror. “Kris!” 

“If we count your chins, will it tell us your age?” 

There was laughter floating up from the audience. But it was mixed 



with gasps of horror. 

“Kris—that’s enough!” Mrs. Berman cried, the microphone picking up 
her angry protest. 

“You’re more than enough! You’re enough for two!” Mr. Wood 
declared nastily. “If you got any bigger, you’d need your own zip code!” 

“Kris—really! I’m going to ask you to apologize,” Mrs. Berman said, 
her face bright red. 

“Mrs. Berman, I—I’m not doing it!” Kris stammered. “I’m not saying 
these things!” 

“Please apologize. To me and to the audience,” Mrs. Berman 
demanded. 

Mr. Wood leaned into the microphone. “Apologize for THIS!” he 
screamed. 

The dummy’s head tilted back. His jaw dropped. His mouth opened 
wide. 

And a thick green liquid came spewing out. 

“Yuck!” someone screamed. 

It looked like pea soup. It spurted up out of Mr. Wood’s open mouth 
like water rushing from a fire hose. 

Voices screamed and cried out their surprise as the thick, green liquid 
showered over the people in the front rows. 

“Stop it!” 

“Help!” 

“Somebody—turn it off!” 

“It stinks!” 

Kris froze in horror, staring as more and more of the disgusting 
substance poured from her dummy’s gaping mouth. 

A putrid stench—the smell of sour milk, of rotten eggs, of burning 
rubber, of decayed meat—rose up from the liquid. It puddled over the stage 
and showered over the front seats. 

Blinded by the spotlight, Kris couldn’t see the audience in front of her. 
But she could hear the choking and the gagging, the frantic cries for help. 

“Clear the auditorium! Clear the auditorium!” Mrs. Berman was 
shouting. 

Kris heard the rumble and scrape of people shoving their way up the 
aisles and out the doors. 



“It stinks!” 

“I’m sick!” 

“Somebody—help!” 

Kris tried to clamp her hand over the dummy’s mouth. But the force of 
the putrid green liquid frothing and spewing out was too strong. It pushed 
her hand away. 

Suddenly she realized she was being shoved from behind. Off the 
stage. Away from the shouting people fleeing the auditorium. Out of the 
glaring spotlight. 

She was backstage before she realized that it was Mrs. Berman who 
was pushing her. 

“I—I don’t know how you did that. Or why!” Mrs. Berman shouted 
angrily, frantically wiping splotches of the disgusting green liquid off the 
front of her dress with both hands. “But I’m going to see that you’re 
suspended from school, Kris! And if I have my way,” she sputtered, “you’ll 
be suspended for lifel”

“That’s right. Close the door,” Mr. Powell said sternly, glaring with 
narrowed eyes at Kris. 

He stood a few inches behind her, arms crossed in front of him, 
making sure she followed his instructions. She had carefully folded Mr. 
Wood in half and shoved him to the back of her closet shelf. Now she 
closed the closet, making sure it was completely shut, as he ordered. 

Lindy watched silently from her bed, her expression troubled. 

“Does the closet door lock?” Mr. Powell asked. 

“No. Not really,” Kris told him, lowering her head. 

“Well, that will have to do,” he said. “On Monday, I’m taking him 
back to the pawn shop. Do not take him out until then.” 

“But, Dad—” 

He raised a hand to silence her. 

“We have to talk about this,” Kris pleaded. “You have to listen to me. 
What happened tonight—it wasn’t a practical joke. I—” 

Her father turned away from her, a scowl on his face. “Kris, I’m sorry. 
We’ll talk tomorrow. Your mother and I—we’re both too angry and too 
upset to talk now.” 

“But, Dad—” 

Ignoring her, he stormed out of the room. She listened to his footsteps, 
hard and hurried, down the stairs. Then Kris slowly turned to Lindy. “Now 
do you believe me?” 

“I—I don’t know what to believe,” Lindy replied. “It was just so... 
unbelievably gross.” 

“Lindy, I—I—” 

“Daddy’s right. Let’s talk tomorrow,” Lindy said. “I’m sure everything 
will be clearer and calmer tomorrow.” 

But Kris couldn’t sleep. She shifted from side to side, uncomfortable, wide 
awake. She pulled the pillow over her face, held it there for a while, 
welcoming the soft darkness, then tossed it to the floor. 

I’m never going to sleep again, she thought. 



Every time she closed her eyes, she saw the hideous scene in the 
auditorium once again. She heard the astonished cries of the audience, the 
kids and their parents. And she heard the cries of shock turn to groans of 
disgust as the putrid gunk poured out over everyone. 

Sickening. So totally sickening. 

And everyone blamed her. 

My life is ruined, Kris thought. I can never go back there again. I can 
never go to school. I can never show my face anywhere. 

Ruined. My whole life. Ruined by that stupid dummy. 

In the next bed, Lindy snored softly, in a slow, steady rhythm. 

Kris turned her eyes to the bedroom window. The curtains hung down 
over the window, filtering the pale moonlight from outside. Slappy sat in 
his usual place in the chair in front of the window, bent in two, his head 
between his knees. 

Stupid dummies, Kris thought bitterly. So stupid. 

And now my life is ruined. 

She glanced at the clock. One-twenty. Outside the window, she heard a 
low, mmbling sound. A soft whistle of brakes. Probably a large truck going 

by. 

Kris yawned. She closed her eyes and saw the gross green gunk 
spewing out of Mr. Wood’s mouth. 

Will I see that every time I close my eyes? she wondered. 

What on earth was it? How could everyone blame me for something 
so... so... 

The rumbling of the tmck faded into the distance. 

But then Kris heard another sound. A rustling sound. 

A soft footstep. 

Someone was moving. 

She sucked in her breath and held it, listening hard. 

Silence now. Silence so heavy, she could hear the loud thudding of her 
heart. 

Then another soft footstep. 

A shadow moved. 

The closet door swung open. 

Or was it just shadows shifting? 

No. Someone was moving. Moving from the open closet. Someone 



was creeping toward the bedroom door. Creeping so softly, so silently. 

Her heart pounding, Kris pulled herself up, trying not to make a sound. 
Realizing that she’d been holding her breath, she let it out slowly, silently. 
She took another breath, then sat up. 

The shadow moved slowly to the door. 

Kris lowered her feet to the floor, staring hard into the darkness, her 
eyes staying with the silent, moving figure. 

What’s happening? she wondered. 

The shadow moved again. She heard a scraping sound, the sound of a 
sleeve brushing the doorframe. 

Kris pushed herself to her feet. Her legs felt shaky as she crept to the 
door, following the moving shadow. 

Out into the hallway. Even darker out here because there were no 
windows. 

Toward the stairway. 

The shadow moved more quickly now. 

Kris followed, her bare feet moving lightly over the thin carpet. 

What’s happening? What’s happening? 

She caught up to the shadowy figure on the landing. “Hey!” she called, 
her voice a tight whisper. 

She grabbed the shoulder and turned the figure around. 

And stared into the grinning face of Mr. Wood. 



19 


Mr. Wood blinked, then hissed at her, an ugly sound, a menacing sound. In 
the darkness of the stairwell, his painted grin became a threatening leer. 

In her fright, Kris squeezed the dummy’s shoulder, wrapping her 
fingers around the harsh fabric of his shirt. 

“This—this is impossible!” she whispered. 

He blinked again. He giggled. His mouth opened, making his grin 
grow wider. 

He tried to tug out of Kris’ grasp, but she hung on without even 
realizing she was holding him. 

“But—you’re a dummy!” she squealed. 

He giggled again. “So are you,” he replied. His voice was a deep 
growl, like the angry snarl of a large dog. 

“You can’t walk!” Kris cried, her voice trembling. 

The dummy giggled its ugly giggle again. 

“You can’t be alive!” Kris exclaimed. 

“Let go of me— now! ” the dummy growled. 

Kris held on, tightening her grip. “I’m dreaming,” Kris told herself 
aloud. “I have to be dreaming.” 

“I’m not a dream. I’m a nightmare!” the dummy exclaimed, and tossed 
back his wooden head, laughing. 

Still gripping the shoulder of the shirt, Kris stared through the darkness 
at the grinning face. The air seemed to grow heavy and hot. She felt as if 
she couldn’t breathe, as if she were suffocating. 

What was that sound? 

It took her a while to recognize the strained gasps of her own 
breathing. 

“Let go of me,” the dummy repeated. “Or I’ll throw you down the 
stairs.” He tried once again to tug out of her grasp. 

“No!” Kris insisted, holding tight. “I—I’m putting you back in the 
closet.” 

The dummy laughed, then pushed his painted face close to Kris’ face. 
“You can’t keep me there.” 



“I’m locking you in. I’m locking you in a box. In something !” Kris 
declared, panic clouding her thoughts. 

The darkness seemed to descend over her, choking her, weighing her 
down. 

“Let go of me.” The dummy pulled hard. 

Kris reached out her other hand and grabbed him around the waist. 

“Let go of me,” he snarled in his raspy, deep rumble of a voice. “I’m in 
charge now. You will listen to me. This is my house now.” 

He pulled hard. 

Kris encircled his waist. 

They both fell onto the stairs, rolling down a few steps. 

“Let go!” the dummy ordered. He rolled on top of her, his wild eyes 
glaring into hers. 

She pushed him off, tried to pin his arms behind his back. 

He was surprisingly strong. He pulled back one arm, then shoved a fist 
hard into the pit of her stomach. 

“Ohhh.” Kris groaned, feeling the breath knocked out of her. 

The dummy took advantage of her momentary weakness, and pulled 
free. Grasping the banister with one hand, he tried to pull himself past her 
and down the stairs. 

But Kris shot out a foot and tripped him. 

Still struggling to breathe, she pounced onto his back. Then she pulled 
him away from the banister and pushed him down hard onto a step. 

“Oh!” Kris gasped loudly as the overhead hall light flashed on. She 
closed her eyes against the sudden harsh intrusion. The dummy struggled to 
pull out from under her, but she pushed down on his back with all her 
weight. 

“Kris—what on earth—?!” Lindy’s startled voice called down from 
the top step. 

“It’s Mr. Wood!” Kris managed to cry up to her. “He’s... a/z've!” She 
pushed down hard, sprawled over the dummy, keeping him pinned beneath 
her. 

“Kris—what are you doing?” Lindy demanded. “Are you okay?” 

“No!” Kris exclaimed. “I’m not okay! Please—Lindy! Go get Mom 
and Dad! Mr. Wood—he’s alive!” 

“It’s just a dummy!” Lindy called down, taking a few reluctant steps 



toward her sister. “Get up, Kris! Have you lost your mind?” 

“Listen to me!” Kris shrieked at the top of her lungs. “Get Mom and 
Dad! Before he escapes!” 

But Lindy didn’t move. She stared down at her sister, her long hair 
falling in tangles about her face, her features twisted in horror. “Get up, 
Kris,” she urged. “Please—get up. Let’s go back to bed.” 

“I’m telling you, he’s alive!” Kris cried desperately. “You’ve got to 
believe me, Lindy. You’ve got to!” 

The dummy lay lifelessly beneath her, his face buried in the carpet, his 
arms and legs sprawled out to the sides. 

“You had a nightmare,” Lindy insisted, climbing down step by step, 
holding her long nightshirt up above her ankles until she was standing right 
above Kris. “Come back to bed, Kris. It was just a nightmare. The horrible 
thing that happened at the concert—it gave you a nightmare, that’s all.” 

Gasping for breath, Kris lifted herself up and twisted her head to face 
her sister. Grabbing the banister with one hand, she raised herself a little. 

The instant she lightened up on him, the dummy grabbed the edge of 
the stair with both hands and pulled himself out from under her. Half¬ 
falling, half-crawling, he scrambled down the rest of the stairs. 

“No! No! I don’t believe it!” Lindy shrieked, seeing the dummy move. 

“Go get Mom and Dad!” Kris said. “Hurry!” 

Her mouth wide open in shocked disbelief, Lindy turned and headed 
back up the stairs, screaming for her parents. 

Kris dived off the step, thrusting her arms in front of her. 

She tackled Mr. Wood from behind, wrapping her arms around his 
waist. 

His head hit the carpet hard as they both crumpled to the floor. 

He uttered a low, throaty cry of pain. His eyes closed. He didn’t move. 

Dazed, her chest heaving, her entire body trembling, Kris slowly 
climbed to her feet. She quickly pressed a foot on the dummy’s back to hold 
him in place. 

“Mom and Dad—where are you?” she cried aloud. “Hurry.” 

The dummy raised its head. He let out an angry growl and started to 
thrash his arms and legs wildly. 

Kris pressed her foot hard against his back. 

“Let go!” he growled viciously. 



Kris heard voices upstairs. 

“Mom? Dad? Down here!” she called up to them. 

Both of her parents appeared at the upstairs landing, their faces filled 
with worry. 

“Look!” Kris cried, frantically pointing down to the dummy beneath 
her foot. 



20 


“Look at what?” Mr. Powell cried, adjusting his pajama top. 

Kris pointed down to the dummy under her foot. “He—he’s trying to 
get away,” she stammered. 

But Mr. Wood lay lifeless on his stomach. 

“Is this supposed to be a joke?” Mrs. Powell demanded angrily, hands 
at the waist of her cotton nightgown. 

“I don’t get it,” Mr. Powell said, shaking his head. 

“Mr. Wood—he ran down the stairs,” Kris said frantically. “He’s been 
doing everything. He—” 

“This isn’t funny,” Mrs. Powell said wearily, running a hand back 
through her blonde hair. “It isn’t funny at all, Kris. Waking everyone up in 
the middle of the night.” 

“I really think you’ve lost your mind. I’m very worried about you,” 
Mr. Powell added. “I mean, after what happened at school tonight—” 

“Listen to me!” Kris shrieked. She bent down and pulled Mr. Wood up 
from the floor. Holding him by the shoulders, she shook him hard. “He 
moves! He runs! He talks! He—he’s alivel” 

She stopped shaking the dummy and let go. He slumped lifelessly to 
the floor, falling in an unmoving heap at her feet. 

“I think maybe you need to see a doctor,” Mr. Powell said, his face 
tightening with concern. 

“No. I saw him, too!” Lindy said, coming to Kris’ aid. “Kris is right. 
The dummy did move.” But then she added, “I mean, I think it moved!” 

You’re a big help, Lindy, Kris thought, suddenly feeling weak, 
drained. 

“Is this just another stupid prank?” Mrs. Powell asked angrily. “After 
what happened at school tonight, I’d think that would be enough.” 

“But, Mom—” Kris started, staring down at the lifeless heap at her 

feet. 

“Back to bed,” Mrs. Powell ordered. “There’s no school tomorrow. 
We’ll have plenty of time to discuss punishments for you two.” 

“Me?” Lindy cried, outraged. “What did / do?” 



“Mom, we’re telling the truth!” Kris insisted. 

“I still don’t get the joke,” Mr. Powell said, shaking his head. He 
turned to his wife. “Were we supposed to believe her or something?” 

“Get to bed. Both of you. Now!” their mother snapped. She and their 
father disappeared from the upstairs landing, heading angrily back down the 
hall to their room. 

Lindy remained, one hand on the top of the banister, staring down 
regretfully at Kris. 

“You believe me, don’t you?” Kris called up to her. 

“Yeah. I guess,” Lindy replied doubtfully, lowering her eyes to the 
dummy at Kris’ feet. 

Kris looked down, too. She saw Mr. Wood blink. He started to 
straighten up. 

“Whoa!” She uttered an alarmed cry and grabbed him by the neck. 
“Lindy—hurry!” she called. “He’s moving again!” 

“Wh-what should we do?” Lindy stammered, making her way 
hesitantly down the stairs. 

“I don’t know,” Kris replied as the dummy thrashed his arms and legs 
against the carpet, trying desperately to free himself from her two-handed 
grip on his neck. “We’ve got to—” 

“There’s nothing you can do,” Mr. Wood snarled. “You will be my 
slaves now. I’m alive once again! Alive!” 

“But—how?” Kris demanded, staring at him in disbelief. “I mean, 
you’re a dummy. How—?” 

The dummy snickered. “You brought me back to life,” he told her in 
his raspy voice. “You read the ancient words.” 

The ancient words? What was he talking about? 

And then Kris remembered. She had read the strange-sounding words 
from the sheet of paper in the dummy’s shirt pocket. 

“I am back, thanks to you,” the dummy growled. “And now you and 
your sister will serve me.” 

As she stared in horror at the grinning dummy, an idea popped into 
Kris’ mind. 

The paper. She had tucked it back into his pocket. 

If I read the words again, Kris thought, it will put him back to sleep. 

She reached out and grabbed him. He tried to jerk away, but she was 



too quick. 

The folded sheet of yellow paper was in her hand. 

“Give me that!” he cried. He swiped at it, but Kris swung it out of his 
reach. 

She unfolded it quickly. And before the dummy could grab the paper 
out of her hands, she read the strange words aloud: 

“Kami marri odonna loma molonu karrano.” 



21 


Both sisters stared at the dummy, waiting for him to collapse. 

But he gripped the banister and tossed his head back in an amused, 
scornful laugh. “Those are the words of the ancient sorcerer to bring me to 
life!” he proclaimed. “Those aren’t the words to kill me!” 

Kill him? 

Yes, Kris thought frantically. She tossed down the yellow paper 
disgustedly. 

We have no choice. 

“We have to kill him, Lindy.” 

“Huh?” Her sister’s face filled with surprise. 

Kris grabbed the dummy by the shoulders and held on tightly. “I’ll 
hold him. You pull his head off.” 

Lindy was beside her now. She had to duck away from Mr. Wood’s 
thrashing feet. 

“I’ll hold him still,” Kris repeated. “Grab his head. Pull it off.” 

“You—you’re sure?” Lindy hesitated, her features tight with fear. 

“Just do it! ” Kris screamed. 

She let her hands slide down around Mr. Wood’s waist. 

Lindy grabbed his head in both hands. 

“Let go of me!” the dummy rasped. 

“Pull!” Kris cried to her terrified sister. 

Holding the dummy tightly around the waist, she leaned back, pulling 
him away from her sister. 

Lindy’s hands were wrapped tightly around the dummy’s head. With a 
loud groan, she pulled hard. 

The head didn’t come off. 

Mr. Wood uttered a high-pitched giggle. “Stop. You’re tickling me!” 
he rasped. 

“Pull harder!” Kris ordered her sister. 

Lindy’s face was bright red. She tightened her grip on the head and 
pulled again, tugging with all her strength. 



The dummy giggled his shrill, unpleasant giggle. 

“It—it won’t come off,” Lindy said, sighing in defeat. 

“Twist it off!” Kris suggested frantically. 

The dummy thrashed out with his feet, kicking Kris in the stomach. 
But she held on. “Twist the head off!” she cried. 

Lindy tried to turn the head. 

The dummy giggled. 

“It won’t twist!” Lindy cried in frustration. She let go of the head and 
took a step back. 

Mr. Wood raised his head, stared up at Lindy, and grinned. “You can’t 
kill me. I have powers.” 

“What do we do?” Lindy cried, raising her eyes to Kris. 

“This is my house now,” the dummy rasped, grinning at Lindy as it 
struggled to wriggle out of Kris’ arms. “You will do as I say now. Put me 
down.” 

“What do we do?” Lindy repeated. 

“Take him upstairs. We’ll cut his head off,” Kris replied. 

Mr. Wood swung his head around, his eyes stretched open in an evil 
glare. 

“Ow!” Kris cried out in surprise as the dummy snapped his jaws over 
her arm, biting her. She pulled her arm away and, without thinking, slapped 
the dummy’s wooden head with the palm of her hand. 

The dummy giggled in response. “Violence! Violence!” he said in a 
mock scolding tone. 

“Get those sharp scissors. In your drawer,” Kris instructed her sister. 
“I’ll carry him up to our room.” 

Her arm throbbed where he had bitten her. But she held onto him 
tightly and carried him up to their bedroom. 

Lindy had already pulled the long metal scissors from the drawer. Her 
hand trembled as she opened and closed the blades. 

“Below the neck,” Kris said, holding Mr. Wood tightly by the 
shoulders. 

He hissed furiously at her. She dodged as he tried to kick her with both 
sneakered feet. 

Holding the scissors with two hands, Lindy tried cutting the head off at 
the neck. The scissors didn’t cut, so she tried a sawing motion. 



Mr. Wood giggled. “I told you. You can’t kill me.” 

“It isn’t going to work,” Lindy cried, tears of frustration running down 
her cheeks. “Now what?” 

“We’ll put him in the closet. Then we can think,” Kris replied. 

“You have no need to think. You are my slaves,” the dummy rasped. 
“You will do whatever I ask. I will be in charge from now on.” 

“No way,” Kris muttered, shaking her head. 

“What if we won’t help you?” Lindy demanded. 

The dummy turned to her, casting her a hard, angry stare. “Then I’ll 
start hurting the ones you love,” he said casually. “Your parents. Your 
friends. Or maybe that disgusting dog that’s always yapping at me.” He 
tossed back his head and a dry, evil laugh escaped his wooden lips. 

“Lock him in the closet,” Lindy suggested. “Till we figure out how to 
get rid of him.” 

“You can’t get rid of me,” Mr. Wood insisted. “Don’t make me angry. I 
have powers. I’m warning you. I’m starting to get tired of your stupid 
attempts to harm me.” 

“The closet doesn’t lock—remember?” Kris cried, struggling to hold 
onto the wriggling dummy. 

“Oh. Wait. How about this?” Lindy hurried to the closet. She pulled 
out an old suitcase from the back. 

“Perfect,” Kris said. 

“I’m warning you—” Mr. Wood threatened. “You are becoming very 
tiresome.” 

With a hard tug, he pulled himself free of Kris. 

She dove to tackle him, but he darted out from under her. She fell 
facedown onto her bed. 

The dummy ran to the center of the room, then turned his eyes to the 
doorway, as if trying to decide where to go. “You must do as I tell you,” he 
said darkly, raising a wooden hand toward Lindy. “I will not run from you 
two. You are to be my slaves.” 

“No!” Kris cried, pushing herself up. 

She and her sister both dove at the dummy. Lindy grabbed his arms. 
Kris ducked to grab his ankles. 

Working together, they stuffed him into the open suitcase. 

“You will regret this,” he threatened, kicking his legs, struggling to hit 



them. “You will pay dearly for this. Now someone will die!” He continued 
screaming after Kris latched the suitcase and shoved it into the closet. She 
quickly closed the closet door, then leaned her back against it, sighing 
wearily. 

“Now what?” she asked Lindy. 



22 


“We’ll bury him,” Kris said. 

“Huh?” Lindy stifled a yawn. 

They had been whispering together for what seemed like hours. As 
they tried to come up with a plan, they could hear the dummy’s muffled 
cries from inside the closet. 

“We’ll bury him. Under that huge mound of dirt,” Kris explained, her 
eyes going to the window. “You know. Next door, at the side of the new 
house.” 

“Yeah. Okay. I don’t know,” Lindy replied. “I’m so tired, I can’t think 
straight.” She glanced at the bed table clock. It was nearly three-thirty in the 
morning. “I still think we should wake up Mom and Dad,” Lindy said, fear 
reflected in her eyes. 

“We can’t,” Kris told her. “We’ve been over that a hundred times. 
They won’t believe us. If we wake them up, we’ll be in even bigger 
trouble.” 

“How could we be in bigger trouble?” Lindy demanded, gesturing 
with her head to the closet where Mr. Wood’s angry cries could still be 
heard. 

“Get dressed,” Kris said with renewed energy. “We’ll bury him under 
all that dirt. Then we’ll never have to think about him again.” 

Lindy shuddered and turned her eyes to her dummy, folded up in the 
chair. “I can’t bear to look at Slappy anymore. I’m so sorry I got us 
interested in dummies.” 

“Ssshhh. Just get dressed,” Kris said impatiently. 

A few minutes later, the two girls crept down the stairs in the darkness. Kris 
carried the suitcase in both arms, trying to muffle the sound of Mr. Wood’s 
angry protests. 

They stopped at the bottom of the stairs and listened for any sign that 
they had awakened their parents. 

Silence. 

Lindy pulled open the front door and they slipped outside. 



The air was surprisingly cool and wet. A heavy dew had begun to fall, 
making the front lawn glisten under the light of a half-moon. Blades of wet 
grass clung to their sneakers as they made their way to the garage. 

As Kris held onto the suitcase, Lindy slowly, quietly, pulled open the 
garage door. When it was halfway up, she ducked and slipped inside. 

A few seconds later she emerged, carrying a large snow shovel. “This 
should do it,” she said, whispering even though no one was around. 

Kris glanced down the street as they headed across the yard to the lot 
next door. The heavy morning dew misted the glow of the streetlamps, 
making the pale light appear to bend and flicker like candles. Everything 
seemed to shimmer under the dark purple sky. 

Kris set the suitcase down beside the tall mound of dirt. “We’ll dig 
right down here,” she said, pointing toward the bottom of the mound. 
“We’ll shove him in and cover him.” 

“I’m warning you,” Mr. Wood threatened, listening inside the suitcase. 
“Your plan won’t work. I have powers!” 

“You dig first,” Kris told her sister, ignoring the dummy’s threat. 
“Then I’ll take a turn.” 

Lindy dug into the pile and heaved up a shovelful of dirt. Kris 
shivered. The heavy dew felt cold and damp. A cloud floated over the 
moon, darkening the sky from purple to black. 

“Let me out!” Mr. Wood called. “Let me out now, and your 
punishment won’t be too severe.” 

“Dig faster,” Kris whispered impatiently. 

“I’m going as fast as I can,” Lindy replied. She had dug a pretty good- 
sized square-shaped hole at the base of the mound. “How much deeper, do 
you think?” 

“Deeper,” Kris said. “Here. Watch the suitcase. I’ll take a turn.” She 
changed places with Lindy and started to dig. 

Something scampered heavily near the low shrubs that separated the 
yards. Kris looked up, saw a moving shadow, and gasped. 

“Raccoon, I think,” Lindy said with a shudder. “Are we going to bury 
Mr. Wood in the suitcase, or are we going to take him out?” 

“Think Mom will notice the suitcase is gone?” Kris asked, tossing a 
shovelful of wet dirt to the side. 

Lindy shook her head. “We never use it.” 



“We’ll bury him in the suitcase,” Kris said. “It’ll be easier.” 

“You’ll be sorry,” the dummy rasped. The suitcase shook and nearly 
toppled onto its side. 

“I’m so sleepy,” Lindy moaned, tossing her socks onto the floor, then 
sliding her feet under the covers. 

“I’m wide awake,” Kris replied, sitting on the edge of her bed. “I guess 
it’s because I’m so happy. So happy we got rid of that awful creature.” 

“It’s all so weird,” Lindy said, adjusting her pillow behind her head. “I 
don’t blame Mom or Dad for not believing it. I’m not sure I believe it, 
either.” 

“You put the shovel back where you found it?” Kris asked. 

Lindy nodded. “Yeah,” she said sleepily. 

“And you closed the garage door?” 

“Ssshhh. I’m asleep,” Lindy said. “At least there’s no school 
tomorrow. We can sleep late.” 

“I hope I can fall asleep,” Kris said doubtfully. “I’m just so pumped. 
It’s all like some kind of hideously gross nightmare. I just think... Lindy? 
Lindy—are you still awake?” 

No. Her sister had fallen asleep. 

Kris stared up at the ceiling. She pulled the blankets up to her chin. 
She still felt chilled. She couldn’t shake the cold dampness of the early 
morning air. 

After a short while, with thoughts of everything that had happened that 
night whirring crazily in her head, Kris fell asleep, too. 

The rumble of machines woke her up at eight-thirty the next morning. 
Stretching, trying to rub the sleep from her eyes, Kris stumbled to the 
window, leaned over the chair holding Slappy, and peered out. 

It was a gray, cloudy day. Two enormous yellow steamrollers were 
rolling over the lot next door behind the newly constructed house, flattening 
the land. 

I wonder if they’re going to flatten that big mound of dirt, Kris 
thought, staring down at them. That would really be excellent. 

Kris smiled. She hadn’t slept very long, but she felt refreshed. 

Lindy was still sound asleep. Kris tiptoed past her, pulled her robe on, 
and headed downstairs. 



“Morning, Mom,” she called brightly, tying the belt to her robe as she 
entered the kitchen. 

Mrs. Powell turned from the sink to face her. Kris was surprised to see 
an angry expression on her face. 

She followed her mother’s stare to the breakfast counter. 

“Oh!” Kris gasped when she saw Mr. Wood. He was seated at the 
counter, his hands in his lap. His hair was matted with red-brown dirt, and 
he had dirt smears on his cheeks and forehead. 

Kris raised her hands to her face in horror. 

“I thought you were told never to bring that thing down here!” Mrs. 
Powell scolded. “What do I have to do, Kris?” She turned angrily back to 
the sink. 

The dummy winked at Kris and flashed her a wide, evil grin. 



23 


As Kris stared in horror at the grinning dummy, Mr. Powell suddenly 
appeared in the kitchen doorway. “Ready?” he asked his wife. 

Mrs. Powell hung the dishtowel on the rack and turned around, 
brushing a lock of hair off her forehead. “Ready. I’ll get my bag.” She 
brushed past him into the front hallway. 

“Where are you going?” Kris cried, her voice revealing her alarm. She 
kept her eyes on the dummy at the counter. 

“Just doing a little shopping at the garden store,” her father told her, 
stepping into the room, peering out the kitchen window. “Looks like rain.” 

“Don’t go!” Kris pleaded. 

“Huh?” He turned toward her. 

“Don’t go—please!” Kris cried. 

Her father’s eyes landed on the dummy. He walked over to him. “Hey 
—what’s the big idea?” her father asked angrily. 

“I thought you wanted to take him back to the pawn shop,” Kris 
replied, thinking quickly. 

“Not till Monday,” her father replied. “Today is Saturday, remember?” 

The dummy blinked. Mr. Powell didn’t notice. 

“Do you have to go shopping now?” Kris asked in a tiny voice. 

Before her father could answer, Mrs. Powell reappeared in the 
doorway. “Here. Catch,” she called, and tossed the car keys to him. “Let’s 
go before it pours.” 

Mr. Powell started to the door. “Why don’t you want us to go?” he 
asked. 

“The dummy—” Kris started. But she knew it was hopeless. They’d 
never listen. They’d never believe her. “Never mind,” she muttered. 

A few seconds later, she heard their car back down the driveway. They 
were gone. 

And she was alone in the kitchen with the grinning dummy. 

Mr. Wood turned toward her slowly, swiveling the tall counter stool. 
His big eyes locked angrily on Kris’. 

“I warned you,” he rasped. 



Barky came trotting into the kitchen, his toenails clicking loudly on the 
linoleum. He sniffed the floor as he ran, searching for breakfast scraps 
someone might have dropped. 

“Barky, where’ve you been?” Kris asked, glad to have company. 

The dog ignored her and sniffed under the stool Mr. Wood sat on. 

“He was upstairs, waking me up,” Lindy said, rubbing her eyes as she 
walked into the kitchen. She was wearing white tennis shorts and a 
sleeveless magenta T-shirt. “Stupid dog.” 

Barky licked at a spot on the linoleum. 

Lindy cried out as she spotted Mr. Wood. “Oh, no!” 

“I’m back,” the dummy rasped. “And I’m very unhappy with you two 
slaves.” 

Lindy turned to Kris, her mouth open in surprise and terror. 

Kris kept her eyes trained on the dummy. What does he plan to do? 
she wondered. How can I stop him? 

Burying him under all that dirt hadn’t kept him from returning. 
Somehow he had freed himself from the suitcase and pulled himself out. 

Wasn’t there any way to defeat him? Any way at all? 

Grinning his evil grin, Mr. Wood dropped down to the floor, his 
sneakers thudding hard on the floor. “I’m very unhappy with you two 
slaves,” he repeated in his growly voice. 

“What are you going to do?” Lindy cried in a shrill, frightened voice. 

“I have to punish you,” the dummy replied. “I have to prove to you 
that I am serious.” 

“Wait!” Kris cried. 

But the dummy moved quickly. He reached down and grabbed Barky 
by the neck with both hands. 

As the dummy tightened his grip, the frightened terrier began to howl 
in pain. 



24 


“I warned you,” Mr. Wood snarled over the howls of the little black terrier. 
“You will do as I say—or one by one, those you love will suffer!” 

“No!” Kris cried. 

Barky let out a high-pitched whelp, a bleat of pain that made Kris 
shudder. 

“Let go of Barky!” Kris screamed. 

The dummy giggled. 

Barky uttered a hoarse gasp. 

Kris couldn’t stand it any longer. She and Lindy leapt at the dummy 
from two sides. Lindy tackled his legs. Kris grabbed Barky and tugged. 

Lindy dragged the dummy to the floor. But his wooden hands held a 
tight grip on the dog’s throat. 

Barky’s howls became a muffled whimper as he struggled to breathe. 

“Let go! Let go!” Kris shrieked. 

“I warned you!” the dummy snarled as Lindy held tight to his kicking 
legs. “The dog must die now!” 

“No!” Kris let go of the gasping dog. She slid her hands down to the 
dummy’s wrists. Then with a fierce tug, she pulled the wooden hands apart. 

Barky dropped to the floor, wheezing. He scampered to the corner, his 
paws sliding frantically over the smooth floor. 

“You’ll pay now!” Mr. Wood growled. Jerking free from Kris, he 
swung his wooden hand up, landing a hard blow on Kris’ forehead. 

She cried out in pain and raised her hands to her head. 

She heard Barky yipping loudly behind her. 

“Let go of me!” Mr. Wood demanded, turning back to Lindy, who still 
held onto his legs. 

“No way!” Lindy cried. “Kris—grab his arms again.” 

Her head still throbbing, Kris lunged forward to grab the dummy’s 
arms. 

But he lowered his head as she approached and clamped his wooden 
jaws around her wrist. 



“Owww!” Kris howled in pain and pulled back. 

Lindy lifted the dummy up by the legs, then slammed his body hard 
against the floor. He uttered a furious growl and tried to kick free of her. 

Kris lunged again, and this time grabbed one arm, then the other. He 
lowered his head to bite once more, but she dodged away and pulled his 
arms tight behind his back. 

“I’m warning you!” he bellowed. “I’m warning you!” 

Barky yipped excitedly, hopping up on Kris. 

“What do we do with him?” Lindy cried, shouting over the dummy’s 
angry threats. 

“Outside!” Kris yelled, pressing the arms more tightly behind Mr. 
Wood’s back. 

She suddenly remembered the two steamrollers she had seen moving 
over the yard next door, flattening the ground. “Come on,” she urged her 
sister. “We’ll crush him!” 

“I’m warning you! I have powers!” the dummy screamed. 

Ignoring him, Kris pulled open the kitchen door and they carried their 
wriggling captive outside. 

The sky was charcoal-gray. A light rain had begun to fall. The grass 
was already wet. 

Over the low shrubs that separated the yards, the girls could see the 
two enormous yellow steamrollers, one in the back, one at the side of the 
next-door lot. They looked like huge, lumbering animals, their giant black 
rollers flattening everything in their path. 

“This way! Hurry!” Kris shouted to her sister, holding the dummy 
tightly as she ran. “Toss him under that one! ” 

“Let me go! Let me go, slaves!” the dummy screamed. “This is your 
last chance!” He swung his head hard, trying to bite Kris’ arm. 

Thunder rumbled, low in the distance. 

The girls ran at full speed, slipping on the wet grass as they hurried 
toward the fast-moving steamroller. 

They were just a few yards away from the enormous machine when 
they saw Barky. His tail wagging furiously, he scampered ahead of them. 

“Oh, no! How’d he get out?” Lindy cried. 

Gazing back at them, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, prancing 
happily in the wet grass, the dog was running right into the path of the 



rumbling steamroller. 

“No, Barky!” Kris shrieked in horror. “No! Barky—no!” 



25 


Letting go of Mr. Wood, both girls dove toward the dog. Hands 
outstretched, they slid on their stomachs on the wet grass. 

Unaware of any problem, enjoying the game of tag, Barky scampered 
away. 

Lindy and Kris rolled out of the path of the steamroller. 

“Hey—get away from there!” the angry operator shouted through the 
high window of the steamroller. “Are you girls crazy?” 

They leapt to their feet and turned back to Mr. Wood. 

The rain began to come down a little harder. A jagged streak of white 
lightning flashed high in the sky. 

“I’m free!” the dummy cried, hands raised victoriously above his head. 
“Now you will pay!” 

“Get him!” Kris shouted to her sister. 

The rain pelted their hair and shoulders. The two girls lowered their 
heads, leaned into the rain, and began to chase after the dummy. 

Mr. Wood turned and started to run. 

He never saw the other steamroller. 

The gigantic black wheel rolled right over him, pushing him onto his 
back, then crushing him with a loud crunch. 

A loud hiss rose up from under the machine, like air escaping from a 
large balloon. 

The steamroller appeared to rock back and forth. 

A strange green gas spurted up from beneath the wheel, into the air, 
spreading out in an eerie, mushroom-shaped cloud. 

Barky stopped scampering and stood frozen in place, his eyes 
following the green gas as it floated up against the nearly black sky. 

Lindy and Kris stared in open mouthed wonder. 

Pushed by the wind and the rain, the green gas floated over them. 

“Yuck! It stinks!” Lindy declared. 

It smelled like rotten eggs. 

Barky uttered a low whimper. 



The steamroller backed up. The driver jumped out and came running 
toward them. He was a short, stocky man with big, muscular arms bulging 
out from the sleeves of his T-shirt. His face was bright red under a short, 
blond flattop, his eyes wide with horror. 

“A kid?” he cried. “I—I ran over a kid?” 

“No. He was a dummy,” Kris told him. “He wasn’t alive.” 

He stopped. His face faded from red to flour-white. He uttered a loud, 
grateful sigh. “Oh, man,” he moaned. “Oh, man. I thought it was a kid.” 

He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Then he bent to examine 
the area beneath his wheel. As the girls came near, they saw the remains of 
the dummy, crushed flat inside its jeans and flannel shirt. 

“Hey, I’m real sorry,” the man said, wiping his forehead with his T- 
shirt sleeve as he straightened up to face them. “I couldn’t stop in time.” 

“That’s okay,” Kris said, a wide smile forming on her face. 

“Yeah. Really. It’s okay,” Lindy quickly agreed. 

Barky moved close to sniff the crushed dummy. 

The man shook his head. “I’m so relieved. It looked like it was 
running. I really thought it was a kid. I was so scared.” 

“No. Just a dummy,” Kris told him. 

“Whew!” The man exhaled slowly. “Close one.” His expression 
changed. “What are you girls doing out in the rain, anyway?” 

Lindy shrugged. Kris shook her head. “Just walking the dog.” 

The man picked up the crushed dummy. The head crumbled to powder 
as he lifted it. “You want this thing?” 

“You can throw it in the trash,” Kris told him. 

“Better get out of the rain,” he told them. “And don’t scare me like that 
again.” 

The girls apologized, then headed back to the house. Kris cast a happy 
grin at her sister. Lindy grinned back. 

I may grin forever, Kris thought. I’m so happy. So relieved. 

They wiped their wet sneakers on the mat, then held the kitchen door 
open for Barky. “Wow. What a morning!” Lindy declared. 

They followed the dog into the kitchen. Outside, a flash of bright 
lightning was followed by a roar of thunder. 

“I’m drenched,” Kris said. “I’m going up to get changed.” 

“Me, too.” Lindy followed her up the stairs. 



They entered their bedroom to find the window wide open, the curtains 
slapping wildly, rain pouring in. “Oh, no!” Kris hurried across the room to 
shut the window. 

As she leaned over the chair to grab the window frame, Slappy 
reached up and grabbed her arm. 

“Hey, slave—is that other guy gone?” the dummy asked in a throaty 
growl. “I thought he’d never leave!” 






THE GIRL WHO 
CRIED MONSTER 
Goosebumps - 08 
R.L. Stine 


1 


I love to scare my little brother, Randy. I tell him scary stories about monsters 
until he begs me to stop. And I’m always teasing him by pretending to see 
monsters everywhere. 

I guess that’s why no one believed me the day I saw a real monster. 

I guess that’s why no one believed me until it was too late, and the monster 
was right in my own house. 

But I’d better not tell the ending of my story at the beginning. 

My name is Lucy Dark. I’m twelve. I live with my brother, Randy, who is 
six, and my parents in a medium-sized house in a medium-sized town called 
Timberland Falls. 

I don’t know why it’s called Timberland Falls. There are a few forests 
outside of town, but no one cuts the trees down for timber. And there aren’t any 
falls. 

So, why Timberland Falls? 

It’s a mystery. 

We have a redbrick house at the end of our street. There’s a tall, overgrown 
hedge that runs along the side of our house and separates our yard from the 
Killeens’ yard next door. Dad’s always talking about how he should trim the 
hedge, but he never does. 

We have a small front yard and a pretty big back yard with a lot of tall, old 
trees in it. There’s an old sassafras tree in the middle of the yard. It’s cool and 
shady under the tree. That’s where I like to sit with Randy when there’s nothing 
better to do, and see if I can scare the socks off of him! 

It isn’t very hard. Randy scares easy. 

He looks a lot like me, even though he’s a boy. He’s got straight black hair 
just like me, only I wear mine longer. He’s short for his age, like me, and just a 
little bit chubby. 

He has a round face, rounder than mine, and big black eyes, which really 
stand out since we both have such pale white skin. 

Mom says Randy has longer eyelashes than mine, which makes me kind of 
jealous. But my nose is straighter, and my teeth don’t stick out as much when I 
smile. So I guess I shouldn’t complain. 



Anyway, on a hot afternoon a couple of weeks ago, Randy and I were 
sitting under the old sassafras tree, and I was getting ready to scare him to death. 

I really didn’t have anything better to do. As soon as summer came around 
this year and school let out, most of my really good friends went away for the 
summer. I was stuck at home, and so I was pretty lonely. 

Randy is usually a total pain. But at least he is somebody to talk to. And 
someone I can scare. 

I have a really good imagination. I can dream up the most amazing 
monsters. And I can make them sound really real. 

Mom says with my imagination, maybe I’ll be a writer when I grow up. 

I really don’t know about that. 

I do know that it doesn’t take a whole lot of imagination to frighten Randy. 

Usually all I have to do is tell him there’s a monster trying on his clothes 
upstairs in his closet, and Randy turns even whiter than normal and starts 
shaking all over. 

The poor kid. I can even make his teeth chatter. It’s unbelievable. 

I leaned back against the smooth part of the tree trunk and rested my hands 
on the grass, and closed my eyes. I was dreaming up a good story to tell my 
brother. 

The grass felt soft and moist against my bare feet. I dug my toes into the 

dirt. 

Randy was wearing denim shorts and a plain white sleeveless T-shirt. He 
was lying on his side, plucking up blades of grass with one hand. 

“Did you ever hear about the Timberland Falls toe-biter?” I asked him, 
brushing a spider off my white tennis shorts. 

“Huh?” He kept pulling up blades of grass one by one, making a little pile. 

“There was this monster called the Timberland Falls toe-biter,” I told 
Randy. 

“Aw, please, Lucy,” he whined. “You said you wouldn’t make up any more 
monster stories.” 

“No, I’m not!” I told him. “This story isn’t made up. It’s true.” 

He looked up at me and made a face. “Yeah. Sure.” 

“No. Really,” I insisted, staring hard into his round, black eyes so he’d 
know I was sincere. “This is a true story. It really happened. Here. In Timberland 
Falls.” 

Randy pulled himself up to a sitting position. “I think I’ll go inside and read 



comic books,” he said, tossing down a handful of grass. 

Randy has a big comic book collection. But they’re all Disney comics and 
Archie comics because the superhero comics are too scary for him. 

“The toe-biter showed up one day right next door,” I told Randy. I knew 
once I started the story, he wouldn’t leave. 

“At the Killeens’?” he asked, his eyes growing wide. 

“Yeah. He arrived in the middle of the afternoon. The toe-biter isn’t a night 
monster, you see. He’s a day monster. He strikes when the sun is high in the sky. 
Just like now.” 

I pointed up through the shimmering tree leaves to the sun, which was high 
overhead in a clear summer-blue sky. 

“A d-day monster?” Randy asked. He turned his head to look at the 
Killeens’ house rising up on the other side of the hedge. 

“Don’t be scared. It happened a couple of summers ago,” I continued. 
“Becky and Lilah were over there. They were swimming. You know. In that 
plastic pool their mom inflates for them. The one that half the water always 
spills out.” 

“And a monster came?” Randy asked. 

“A toe-biter,” I told him, keeping my expression very serious and lowering 
my voice nearly to a whisper. “A toe-biter came crawling across their back 
yard.” 

“Where’d he come from?” Randy asked, leaning forward. 

I shrugged. “No one knows. You see, the thing about toe-biters is they’re 
very hard to see when they crawl across grass. Because they make themselves 
the exact color of the grass.” 

“You mean they’re green?” Randy asked, rubbing his pudgy nose. 

I shook my head. “They’re only green when they creep and crawl over the 
grass,” I replied. “They change their color to match what they’re walking on. So 
you can’t see them.” 

“Well, how big is it?” Randy asked thoughtfully. 

“Big,” I said. “Bigger than a dog.” I watched an ant crawl up my leg, then 
flicked if off. “No one really knows how big because this monster blends in so 
well.” 

“So what happened?” Randy asked, sounding a little breathless. “I mean to 
Becky and Lilah.” Again he glanced over at the Killeens’ gray-shingle house. 

“Well, they were in their little plastic pool,” I continued. “You know. 



Splashing around. And I guess Becky was lying on her back and had her feet 
hanging over the side of the pool. And the monster scampered over the grass, 
nearly invisible. And it saw Becky’s toes dangling in the air.” 

“And—and Becky didn’t see the monster?” Randy asked. 

I could see he was starting to get real pale and trembly. 

“Toe-biters are just so hard to see,” I said, keeping my eyes locked on 
Randy’s, keeping my face very straight and solemn. 

I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Just to build up suspense. Then I 
continued the story. 

“Becky didn’t notice anything at first. Then she felt a kind of tickling 
feeling. She thought it was the dog licking at her toes. She kicked a little and told 
the dog to go away. 

“But then it didn’t tickle so much. It started to hurt. Becky shouted for the 
dog to stop. But the hurting got even worse. It felt like the dog was chewing on 
her toes, with very sharp teeth. 

“It started to hurt a whole lot. So Becky sat up and pulled her feet into the 
pool. And... when she looked down at her left foot, she saw it.” 

I stopped and waited for Randy to ask. 

“Wh-what?” he asked finally, in a shaky voice. “What did she see?” 

I leaned forward and brought my mouth close to his ear. “All the toes were 
missing from her left foot,” I whispered. 

“No!” Randy screamed. He jumped to his feet. He was as pale as a ghost, 
and he looked really scared. “That’s not true!” 

I shook my head solemnly. I forced myself not to crack a smile. “Ask 
Becky to take off her left shoe,” I told him. “You’ll see.” 

“No! You’re lying!” Randy wailed. 

“Ask her,” I said softly. 

And then I glanced down at my feet, and my eyes popped wide with horror. 
“R-R-Randy—look!” I stammered and pointed with a trembling hand down to 
my feet. 

Randy uttered a deafening scream when he saw what I was pointing at. 

All the toes on my left foot were missing. 



2 


“Waaaauiii!” 

Randy let out another terrified wail. Then he took off, running full speed to 
the house, crying for Mom. 

I took off after him. I didn’t want to get in trouble for scaring him again. 

“Randy—wait! Wait! I’m okay!” I shouted, laughing. 

Of course I had my toes buried in the dirt. 

He should’ve been able to figure that out. 

But he was too scared to think straight. 

“Wait!” I called after him. “I didn’t get to show you the monster in the 
tree!” 

He heard that. He stopped and turned around, his face still all twisted up in 
fright. “Huh?” 

“There’s a monster up in the tree,” I said, pointing to the sassafras tree we’d 
just been sitting under. “A tree monster. I saw it!” 

“No way!” he screamed, and started mnning again to the house. 

“I’ll show it to you!” I called, cupping my hands around my mouth so he’d 
hear me. 

He didn’t look back. I watched him stumble up the steps to the back stoop 
and disappear into the house. The screen door slammed hard behind him. 

I stood staring at the back of the house, waiting for Randy to poke his 
frightened head out again. But he didn’t. 

I burst out laughing. I mean, the toe-biter was one of my best creations. 
And then digging my toes into the dirt and pretending the monster had gotten 
me, too —what a hot! 

Poor Randy. He was just too easy a victim. 

And now he was probably in the kitchen, squealing on me to Mom. That 
meant that real soon I’d be in for another lecture about how it wasn’t nice to 
scare my little brother and fill him full of scary monster stories. 

But what else was there to do? 

I stood there staring at the house, waiting for one of them to call me in. 
Suddenly a hand grabbed my shoulder hard from behind. “Gotcha!” a voice 
growled. 




“Oh!” I cried out and nearly jumped out of my skin. 

A monster! 

I spun around—and stared at the laughing face of my friend Aaron Messer. 

Aaron giggled his high-pitched giggle till he had tears in his eyes. 

I shook my head, frowning. “You didn’t scare me,” I insisted. 

“Oh. Sure,” he replied, rolling his blue eyes. “That’s why you screamed for 
help!” 

“I didn ’t scream for help,” I protested. “I just cried out a little. In surprise. 
That’s all.” 

Aaron chuckled. “You thought it was a monster. Admit it.” 

“A monster?” I said, sneering. “Why would I think that?” 

“Because that’s all you think about,” he said smugly. “You’re obsessed.” 

“Oooh. Big word!” I teased him. 

He made a face at me. Aaron is my only friend who stuck around this 
summer. His parents are taking him somewhere out west in a few months. But in 
the meantime he’s stuck like me, just hanging out, trying to fill the time. 

Aaron is about a foot taller than me. But who isn’t? He has curly red hair 
and freckles all over his face. He’s very skinny, and he wears long, baggy shorts 
that make him look even skinnier. 

“I just saw Randy run into the house. Why was he crying like that?” Aaron 
asked, glancing to the house. 

I could see Randy at the kitchen window, staring out at us. 

“I think he saw a monster,” I told Aaron. 

“Huh? Not monsters again!” Aaron cried. He gave me a playful shove. “Get 
out of here, Lucy!” 

“There’s one up in that tree,” I said seriously, pointing. 

Aaron turned around to look. “You’re so dumb,” he said, grinning. 

“No. Really,” I insisted. “There’s a real ugly monster. I think it’s trapped up 
there in that tree.” 

“Lucy, stop it,” Aaron said. 

“That’s what Randy saw,” I continued. “That’s what made him run 
screaming into the house.” 

“You see monsters everywhere,” Aaron said. “Don’t you ever get tired of 

it?” 

“I’m not kidding this time,” I told him. My chin trembled, and my 
expression turned to outright fear as I gazed over Aaron’s shoulder at the broad, 



leafy sassafras tree. “I’ll prove it to you.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Aaron replied with his usual sarcasm. 

“Really. Go get that broom.” I motioned to the broom leaning against the 
back of the house. 

“Huh? What for?” Aaron asked. 

“Go get the broom,” I insisted. “We’ll see if we can get the monster down 
from the tree.” 

“Uh... why do we want to do that?” Aaron asked. He sounded very 
hesitant. I could see that he was starting to wonder if I was being serious or not. 

“So you’ll believe me,” I said seriously. 

“I don’t believe in monsters,” Aaron replied. “You know that, Lucy. Save 
your monster stories for Randy. He’s just a kid.” 

“Will you believe me if one drops out of that tree?” I asked. 

“Nothing is going to drop out of that tree. Except maybe some leaves,” 
Aaron said. 

“Go get the broom and we’ll see,” I said. 

“Okay. Fine.” He went trotting toward the house. 

I grabbed the broom out of his hand when he brought it over. “Come on,” I 
said, leading the way to the tree. “I hope the monster hasn’t climbed away.” 

Aaron rolled his eyes. “I can’t believe I’m going along with this, Lucy. I 
must be really bored!” 

“You won’t be bored in a second,” I promised. “If the tree monster is still 
up there.” 

We stepped into the shade of the tree. I moved close to the trunk and gazed 
up into its leafy green branches. “Whoa. Stay right there.” I put my hand on 
Aaron’s chest, holding him back. “It could be dangerous.” 

“Give me a break,” he muttered under his breath. 

“I’ll try to shake the branch and bring it down,” I said. 

“Let me get this straight,” Aaron said. “You expect me to believe that 
you’re going to take the broom, shake a tree branch, and a monster is going to 
come tumbling down from up there?” 

“Uh-huh.” I could see that the broom handle wasn’t quite long enough to 
reach. “I’m going to have to climb up a little,” I told Aaron. “Just watch out, 
okay?” 

“Ooh, I’m shaking. I’m soooo scared!” Aaron cried, making fun of me. 

I shimmied up the trunk and pulled myself onto the lowest limb. It took me 



a while because I had the broom in one hand. 

“See any scary monsters up there?” Aaron asked smugly. 

“It’s up there,” I called down, fear creeping into my voice. “It’s trapped up 
there. It’s... very angry, I think.” 

Aaron snickered. “You’re so dumb.” 

I pulled myself up to a kneeling position on the limb. Then I raised the 
broom in front of me. 

I lifted it up to the next branch. Higher. Higher. 

Then, holding on tightly to the trunk with my free hand, I raised the broom 
as far as it would go—and pushed it against the tree limb. 

Success! 

I lowered my eyes immediately to watch Aaron. 

He let out a deafening shriek of horror as the monster toppled from the tree 
and landed right on his chest. 



3 


Well, actually it wasn’t a monster that landed with a soft, crackly thud on 
Aaron’s chest. 

It was a ratty old bird’s nest that some blue jays had built two springs ago. 

But Aaron wasn’t expecting it. So it gave him a really good scare. 

“Gotcha!” I proclaimed after climbing down from the tree. 

He scowled at me. His face was a little purple, which made his freckles 
look really weird. “You and your monsters,” he muttered. 

That’s exactly what my mom said about ten minutes later. Aaron had gone 
home, and I’d come into the kitchen and pulled a box of juice out of the fridge. 

Sure enough, Mom appeared in the doorway, her eyes hard and steely, her 
expression grim. I could see right away that she was ready to give her “Don’t 
Scare Randy” lecture. 

I leaned back against the counter and pretended to listen. The basic idea of 
the lecture was that my stories were doing permanent harm to my delicate little 
brother. That I should be encouraging Randy to be brave instead of making him 
terrified that monsters lurked in every corner. 

“But, Mom—I saw a real monster under the hedge this morning!” I said. 

I don’t really know why I said that. I guess I just wanted to interrupt the 
lecture. 

Mom got really exasperated. She threw up her hands and sighed. She has 
straight, shiny black hair, like Randy and me, and she has green eyes, cat eyes, 
and a small, feline nose. Whenever Mom starts in on me with one of her lectures, 
I always picture her as a cat about to pounce. 

Don’t get me wrong. She’s very pretty. And she’s a good mom, too. 

“I’m going to discuss this with your dad tonight,” she said. “Your dad 
thinks this monster obsession is just a phase you’re going through. But I’m not 
so sure.” 

“Life is just a phase I’m going through,” I said softly. 

I thought it was pretty clever. But she just glared at me. 

Then she reminded me that if I didn’t hurry, I’d be late for my Reading 
Rangers meeting. 

I glanced at the clock. She was right. My appointment was for four o’clock. 



Reading Rangers is a summer reading program at the town library that 
Mom and Dad made me enroll in. They said they didn’t want me to waste the 
whole summer. And if I joined this thing at the library, at least I’d read some 
good books. 

The way Reading Rangers works is, I have to go see Mr. Mortman, the 
librarian, once a week. And I have to give a short report and answer some 
questions about the book I read that week. I get a gold star for every book I 
report on. 

If I get six gold stars, I get a prize. I think the prize is a book. Big deal, 
right? But it’s just a way to make you read. 

I thought I’d read some of the scary mystery novels that all my friends are 
reading. But no way. Mr. Mortman insists on everyone reading “classics”. He 
means old books. 

“I’m going to skate over,” I told my mom, and hurried to my room to get 
my Rollerblades. 

“You’d better fly over!” my mom called up to me. “Hey,” she added a few 
seconds later, “it looks like rain!” 

She was always giving me weather reports. 

I passed by Randy’s room. He was in there in the dark, no lights, the shades 
pulled. Playing Super Nintendo, as usual. 

By the time I got my Rollerblades laced and tied, I had only five minutes to 
get to the library. Luckily, it was only six or seven blocks away. 

I was in big trouble anyway. I had managed to read only four chapters of 
Huckleberry Finn, my book for the week. That meant I was going to have to 
fake it with Mr. Mortman. 

I picked the book up from my shelf. It was a new paperback. I wrinkled up 
some of the pages near the back to make it look as if I’d read that far. I tucked it 
into my backpack, along with a pair of sneakers. Then I made my way down the 
stairs—not easy in Rollerblades—and headed to the Timberland Falls town 
library. 

The library was in a ramshackle old house on the edge of the Timberland 
woods. The house had belonged to some eccentric old hermit. And when he 
died, he had no family, so he donated the house to the town. They turned it into a 
library. 

Some kids said the house had been haunted. But kids say that about every 
creepy old house. The library did look like a perfect haunted house, though. 



It was three stories tall, dark shingled, with a dark, pointy roof between two 
stone turrets. The house was set back in the trees, as if hiding there. It was 
always in the shade, always dark and cold inside. 

Inside, the old floorboards creaked beneath the thin carpet the town had put 
down. The high windows let in very little light. And the old wooden bookcases 
reached nearly to the ceiling. When I edged my way through the narrow aisles 
between the tall, dark shelves, I always felt as if they were about to close in on 
me. 

I had this frightening feeling that the shelves would lean in on me, cover me 
up, and I’d be buried there in the darkness forever. Buried under a thousand 
pounds of dusty, mildewy old books. 

But of course that’s silly. 

It was just a very old house. Very dark and damp. Very creaky. Not as clean 
as a library should be. Lots of cobwebs and dust. 

Mr. Mortman did his best, I guess. But he was kind of creepy, too. 

The thing all of us kids hated the most about him was that his hands always 
seemed to be wet. He would smile at you with those beady little black eyes of 
his lighting up on his plump, bald head. He would reach out and shake your 
hand. And his hand was always sopping! 

When he turned the pages of books, he’d leave wet fingerprints on the 
corners. His desktop always had small puddles on the top, moist handprints on 
the leather desk protector. 

He was short and round. With that shiny, bald head and those tiny black 
eyes, he looked a lot like a mole. A wet-pawed mole. 

He spoke in a high, scratchy voice. Nearly always whispered. He wasn’t a 
bad guy, really. He seemed to like kids. He wasn’t mean or anything. And he 
really liked books. 

He was just weird, that’s all. He sat on a tall wooden stool that made him 
hover over his enormous desk. He kept a deep aluminum pan on the side of his 
desk. Inside the pan were several little turtles, moving around in about an inch of 
water. “My timid friends,” I heard him call them once. 

Sometimes he’d pick up one of them and hold it in his pudgy fingers, high 
in the air, until it tucked itself into its shell. Then he’d gently set it down, a 
pleased smile on his pale, flabby face. 

He sure loved his turtles. I guess they were okay as pets. But they were kind 
of smelly. I always tried to sit on the other side of the desk, as far away from the 



turtle pan as I could get. 

Well, I skated to the library as fast as I could. I was only a few minutes late 
when I skated into the cool shade of the library driveway. The sky was clouding 
over. I sat down on the stone steps and pulled off the Rollerblades. Then I 
quickly slid into my sneakers and, carrying my Rollerblades, I walked through 
the front door. 

Making my way through the stacks—the tall, narrow shelves at the back of 
the main reading room—I dropped the skates against the wall. Then I walked 
quickly through the aisles to Mr. Mortman’s desk against the back wall. 

He heard my footsteps and immediately glanced up from the pile of books 
he was stamping with a big rubber stamp. The ceiling light made his bald head 
shine like a lamp. He smiled. “Hi, Lucy,” he said in his squeaky voice. “Be right 
with you.” 

I said hi and sat down in the folding chair in front of his desk. I watched 
him stamp the books. He was wearing a gray turtleneck sweater, which made 
him look a lot like his pet turtles. 

Finally, after glancing at the big, loudly ticking clock on the wall, he turned 
to me. 

“And what did you read for Reading Rangers this week, Lucy?” He leaned 
over the desk toward me. I could see wet fingerprints on the dark desktop. 

“Uh... Huckleberry Finn.” I pulled the book from my backpack and 
dropped it into my lap. 

“Yes, yes. A wonderful book,” Mr. Mortman said, glancing at the paperback 
in my lap. “Don’t you agree?” 

“Yes,” I said quickly. “I really enjoyed it. I... couldn’t put it down.” 

That was sort of true. I never picked it up—so how could I put it down? 

“What did you like best about Huckleberry Finn?” Mr. Mortman asked, 
smiling at me expectantly. 

“Uh... the description,” I told him. 

I had my Reading Rangers gold star in my T-shirt pocket. And I had a new book 
in my backpack— Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley. 

Maybe I’ll read Frankenstein out loud to Randy, I thought evilly. 

That would probably make his teeth chatter forever! 

The late afternoon sun was hidden behind spreading rain clouds. I had 
walked nearly all the way home when I realized I had forgotten my Rollerblades. 



So I turned around and went back. I wasn’t sure how late the library stayed 
open. Mr. Mortman had seemed to be entirely alone in there. I hoped he hadn’t 
decided to close up shop early. I really didn’t want to leave my new Rollerblades 
in there overnight. 

I stopped and stared up at the old library. Deep in the shade, it seemed to 
stare back at me, its dark windows like black, unblinking eyes. 

I climbed the stone steps, then hesitated with my hand on the door. I had a 
sudden chill. 

Was it just from stepping into the deep shade? 

No. It was something else. 

I had a funny feeling. A bad feeling. 

I get those sometimes. A signal. A moment of unease. 

Like something bad is about to happen. 

Shaking it off, I pushed open the creaking old door and stepped into the 
musty darkness of the library.

Shadows danced across the wall as I made my way to the main room. A tree 
branch tapped noisily against the dust-covered pane of a high window. 

The library was silent except for the creaking floorboards beneath my 
sneakers. As I entered the main room, I could hear the steady tick-tick-tick of the 
wall clock. 

The lights had all been turned off. 

I thought I felt something scamper across my shoe. 

A mouse? 

I stopped short and glanced down. 

Just a dustball clinging to the base of a bookshelf. 

Whoa, Lucy, I scolded myself. It’s just a dusty old library. Nothing to get 
weird about. Don’t let your wild imagination take off and lead you into trouble. 

Trouble? 

I still had that strange feeling. A gentle but insistent gnawing at my 
stomach. A tug at my chest. 

Something isn’t right. Something bad is about to happen. 

People call them premonitions. It’s a good vocabulary word for what I was 
feeling right then. 

I found my Rollerblades where I had left them, against the wall back in the 
stacks. I grabbed them up, eager to get out of that dark, creepy place. 

I headed quickly back toward the entrance, tiptoeing for some reason. But a 
sound made me stop. 

I held my breath. And listened. 

It was just a cough. 

Peering down the narrow aisle, I could see Mr. Mortman hovered over his 
desk. Well, actually, I could just see part of him—one arm, and some of his face 
when he leaned to the left. 

I was still holding my breath. 

The clock tick-tick-ticked noisily from across the room. Behind his desk, 
Mr. Mortman’s face moved in and out of blue-purple shadows. 

The Rollerblades suddenly felt heavy. I lowered them silently to the floor. 
Then my curiosity got the better of me, and I took a few steps toward the front. 



Mr. Mortman began humming to himself. I didn’t recognize the song. 

The shadows grew deeper as I approached. Peering down the dark aisle, I 
saw him holding a large glass jar between his pudgy hands. I was close enough 
to see that he had a pleasant smile on his face. 

Keeping in the shadows, I moved closer. 

I like spying on people. It’s kind of thrilling, even when they don’t do 
anything very interesting. 

Just knowing that you’re watching them and they don’t know they’re being 
watched is exciting. 

Humming to himself, Mr. Mortman held the jar in front of his chest and 
started to unscrew the top. “Some juicy flies, my timid friends,” he announced in 
his high-pitched voice. 

So. The jar was filled with flies. 

Suddenly, the room grew much darker as clouds rolled over the late 
afternoon sun. The light from the window dimmed. Gray shadows rolled over 
Mr. Mortman and his enormous desk, as if blanketing him in darkness. 

From my hidden perch among the shelves, I watched him prepare to feed 
his turtles. 

But wait. 

Something was wrong. 

My premonition was coming true. 

Something weird was happening! 

As he struggled to unscrew the jar lid, Mr. Mortman’s face began to change. 
His head floated up from his turtleneck and started to expand, like a balloon 
being inflated. 

I uttered a silent gasp as I saw his tiny eyes poke out of his head. The eyes 
bulged bigger and bigger, until they were as big as doorknobs. 

The light from the window grew even dimmer. 

The entire room was cast in heavy shadows. The shadows swung and 
shifted. 

I couldn’t see well at all. It was like I was watching everything through a 
dark fog. 

Mr. Mortman continued to hum, even as his head bobbed and throbbed 
above his shoulders and his eyes bulged out as if on stems, poking straight up 
like insect antennae. 

And then his mouth began to twist and grow. It opened wide, like a gaping 



black hole on the enormous, bobbing head. 

Mr. Mortman sang louder now. An eerie, frightening sound, more like 
animal howling than singing. 

He pulled off the lid of the jar and let it fall to the desk. It clanged loudly as 
it hit the desktop. 

I leaned forward, struggling to see. Squinting hard, I saw Mr. Mortman dip 
his fat hand into the jar. I could hear loud buzzing from the jar. He pulled out a 
handful of flies. 

I could see his eyes bulge even wider. 

I could see the gaping black hole that was his mouth. 

He held his hand briefly over the turtle cage. I could see the flies, black dots 
all over his hand. In his palm. On his short, stubby fingers. 

I thought he was going to lower his hand to the aluminum pan. I thought he 
was going to feed the turtles. 

But, instead, he jammed the flies into his own mouth. 

I shut my eyes and held my hand over my mouth to keep from puking. 

Or screaming. 

I held my breath, but my heart kept racing. 

The shadows lurched and jumped. The darkness seemed to float around me. 

I opened my eyes. He was eating another handful of flies, shoving them 
into his gaping mouth with his fingers, swallowing them whole. 

I wanted to shout. I wanted to run. 

Mr. Mortman, I realized, was a monster.

The shadows seemed to pull away. The sky outside the window brightened, and 
a gray triangle of light fell over Mr. Mortman’s desk. 

Opening my eyes, I realized I’d been holding my breath. My chest felt as if 
it were about to burst. I let the air out slowly and took another deep breath. 

Then, without glancing again to the front of the room, I turned and ran. My 
sneakers thudded over the creaky floors, but I didn’t care. 

I had to get out of there as fast as I could. 

I bolted out the front door of the library onto the stone steps, then down the 
gravel driveway. I ran as fast as I could, my arms flying wildly at my sides, my 
black hair blowing behind me. 

I didn’t stop until I was a block away. 

Then I dropped to the curb and waited for my heart to stop pounding like a 
bass drum. 

Heavy rain clouds rolled over the sun again. 

The sky became an eerie yellow-black. A station wagon rolled past. Some 
kids in the back of it called to me, but I didn’t raise my head. 

I kept seeing the shadowy scene in the library again and again. 

Mr. Mortman is a monster. 

The words repeated nonstop in my mind. 

It can’t be, I thought, gazing up at the black clouds so low overhead. 

I was seeing things. That had to be it. 

All the shadows in the dark library. All the swirling darkness. 

It was an optical illusion. 

It was my wild imagination. 

It was a daydream, a silly fantasy. 

No! a loud voice in my head cried. 

No, Lucy, you saw Mr. Mortman’s head bulge. You saw his eyes pop out 
and grow like hideous toadstools on his ballooning face. 

You saw him reach into the fly jar. You heard him humming so happily, 
so... hungrily. 

You saw him jam the flies into his mouth. Not one handful, but two. 



And maybe he’s still in there, eating his fill. 

It was dark, Lucy. There were shadows. But you saw what you saw. You 
saw it all. 

Mr. Mortman is a monster. 

I climbed to my feet. I felt a cold drop of rain on top of my head. 

“Mr. Mortman is a monster.” I said it out loud. 

I knew I had to tell Mom and Dad as fast as I could. “The librarian is a 
monster.” That’s what I’d tell them. 

Of course, they’ll be shocked. Who wouldn’t be? 

Feeling another raindrop on my head, then one on my shoulder, I started 
jogging for home. I had gone about half a block when I stopped. 

The stupid Rollerblades! I had left them in the library again. 

I turned back. A gust of wind blew my hair over my face. I pushed it back 
with both hands. I was thinking hard, trying to figure out what to do. 

Rain pattered softly on the pavement of the street. The cold raindrops felt 
good on my hot forehead. 

I decided to go back to the library and get my skates. This time, I’d make a 
lot of noise. Make sure Mr. Mortman knew someone was there. 

If he heard me coming, I decided, he’d act normal. He wouldn’t eat flies in 
front of me. He wouldn’t let his eyes bulge and his head grow like that. 

Would he? 

I stopped as the library came back into view. I hesitated, staring through the 
drizzling rain at the old building. 

Maybe I should wait and come back tomorrow with my dad. 

Wouldn’t that be smarter? 

No. I decided I wanted my skates. And I was going to get them. 

I’ve always been pretty brave. 

The time a bat flew into our house, / was the one who yelled and screamed 
at it and chased it out with a butterfly net. 

I’m not afraid of bats. Or snakes. Or bugs. 

“Or monsters,” I said out loud. 

As I walked up to the front of the library, rain pattering softly all around 
me, I kept telling myself to make a lot of noise. Make sure Mr. Mortman knows 
you’re there, Lucy. Call out to him. Tell him you came back because you left 
your skates. 

He won’t let you see that he’s a monster if he knows you’re there. 



He won’t hurt you or anything if you give him some warning. 

I kept reassuring myself all the way up to the dark, old building. I climbed 
the stone steps hesitantly. 

Then, taking a deep breath, I grabbed the doorknob and started to go in.

I turned the knob and pushed, but the door refused to open. I tried again. It took 
me a while to realize that it was locked. 

The library was closed. 

The rain pattered softly on the grass as I walked around to the front 
window. It was high off the ground. I had to pull myself up on the window ledge 
to look inside. 

Darkness. Total darkness. 

I felt relieved and disappointed at the same time. 

I wanted my skates, but I didn’t really want to go back in there. “I’ll get 
them tomorrow,” I said out loud. 

I lowered myself to the ground. The rain was starting to come down harder, 
and the wind was picking up, blowing the rain in sheets. 

I started to run, my sneakers squishing over the wet grass. I ran all the way 
home. I was totally drenched by the time I made my way through the front door. 
My hair was matted down on my head. My T-shirt was soaked through. 

“Mom! Dad? Are you home?” I cried. 

I ran through the hallway, nearly slipping on the smooth floor, and burst 
into the kitchen. “A monster!” I cried. 

“Huh?” Randy was seated at the kitchen table, snapping a big pile of string 
beans for Mom. He was the only one who looked up. 

Mom and Dad were standing at the counter, rolling little meatballs in their 
hands. They didn’t even turn around. 

“A monster!” I screamed again. 

“Where?” Randy cried. 

“Did you get caught in the rain?” Mom asked. 

“Don’t you say hi?” Dad asked. “Do you just explode into a room yelling? 
Don’t I get a ‘Hi, Dad,’ or anything?” 

“Hi, Dad,” I cried breathlessly. “There’s a monster in the library!” 

“Lucy, please—” Mom started impatiently. 

“What kind of monster?” Randy asked. He had stopped snapping the ends 
off the beans and was staring hard at me. 

Mom finally turned around. “You’re soaked!” she cried. “You’re dripping 



all over the floor. Get upstairs and change into dry clothes.” 

Dad turned, too, a frown on his face. “Your mother just washed the floor,” 
he muttered. 

“I’m trying to tell you something!” I shouted, raising my fists in the air. 

“No need to scream,” Mom scolded. “Get changed. Then tell us.” 

“But Mr. Mortman is a monster! ” I cried. 

“Can’t you save the monster stuff till later? I just got home, and I’ve got the 
worst headache,” Dad complained. His eyes stared down at the kitchen floor. 
Small puddles were forming around me on the white linoleum. 

“I’m serious!” I insisted. “Mr. Mortman—he’s really a monster!” 

Randy laughed. “He’s funny-looking.” 

“Randy, it’s not nice to make fun of people’s looks,” Mom said crossly. She 
turned back to me. “See what you’re teaching your little brother? Can’t you set a 
good example?” 

“But, Mom!” 

“Lucy, please get into dry clothes,” Dad pleaded. “Then come down and set 
the table, okay?” 

I was so frustrated! I tilted my head back and let out an angry growl. 
“Doesn’t anyone here believe me?” I cried. 

“This really isn’t the time for your monster stories,” Mom said, turning 
back to her meatballs. “Larry, you’re making them too big,” she scolded my 
father. “They’re supposed to be small and delicate.” 

“But I like big meatballs,” Dad insisted. 

No one was paying any attention to me. I turned and stomped angrily out of 
the kitchen. 

“Is Mr. Mortman really a monster?” Randy called after me. 

“I don’t know, and I don’t care—about anything!” I screamed back. I was 
just so angry and upset. 

They didn’t have to ignore me like that. 

All they cared about was their stupid meatballs. 

Up in my room, I pulled off my wet clothes and tossed them on the floor. I 
changed into jeans and a tank top. 

Is Mr. Mortman really a monster? 

Randy’s question repeated in my head. 

Did I imagine the whole thing? Do I just have monsters on the brain? 

It had been so dark and shadowy in the library with all the lights turned off. 



Maybe Mr. Mortman didn’t eat the flies. Maybe he pulled them out of the jar and 
fed them to his pet turtles. 

Maybe I imagined that he ate them. 

Maybe his head didn’t swell up like a balloon. Maybe his eyes didn’t pop 
out. Maybe that was just a trick of the darkness, the dancing shadows, the dim 
gray light. 

Maybe I need glasses. 

Maybe I’m crazy and weird. 

“Lucy—hurry down and set the table,” my dad called up the stairs. 

“Okay. Coming.” As I made my way downstairs, I felt all mixed up. 

I didn’t mention Mr. Mortman at dinner. Actually, Mom brought him up. 
“What book did you choose to read this week?” she asked. 

“Frankenstein, ” I told her. 

Dad groaned. “More monsters!” he cried, shaking his head. “Don’t you ever 
get enough monsters? You see them wherever you go! Do you have to read 
about monsters, too?” 

Dad has a big booming voice. Everything about my dad is big. He looks 
very tough, with a broad chest and powerful-looking arms. When he shouts, the 
whole house shakes. 

“Randy, you did a great job with the string beans,” Mom said, quickly 
changing the subject. 

After dinner, I helped Dad with the dishes. Then I went upstairs to my room 
to start reading Frankenstein. I’d seen the old movie of Frankenstein on TV, so I 
knew what it was about. It was about a scientist who builds a monster, and the 
monster comes to life. 

It sounded like my kind of story. 

I wondered if it was true. 

To my surprise, I found Randy in my room, sitting on my bed, waiting for 
me. “What do you want?” I asked. I really don’t like him messing around in my 
room. 

“Tell me about Mr. Mortman,” he said. I could tell by his face that he was 
scared and excited at the same time. 

I sat down on the edge of the bed. I realized I was eager to tell someone 
about what had happened in the library. So I told Randy the whole story, starting 
with how I had to go back there because I’d left my Rollerblades. 

Randy was squeezing my pillow against his chest and breathing really hard. 



The story got him pretty scared, I guess. 

I was just finishing the part where Mr. Mortman stuffed a handful of flies 
into his mouth. Randy gasped. He looked sick. 

“Lucy!” My dad burst angrily into the room. “What is your problem ?” 

“Nothing, Dad, I—” 

“How many times do we have to tell you not to frighten Randy with your 
silly monster stories?” 

“Silly?” I shrieked. “But, Dad—this one is true!” 

He made a disgusted face and stood there glaring at me. I expected fire to 
come shooting out of his nostrils at any minute. 

“I—I’m not scared. Really!” Randy protested, coming to my defense. But 
my poor brother was as white as the pillow he was holding, and trembling all 
over. 

“This is your last warning,” Dad said. “I mean it, Lucy. I’m really angry.” 
He disappeared back downstairs. 

I stared at the doorway where he’d been standing. 

I’m really angry, too, I thought. 

I’m really angry that no one in this family believes me when I’m being 
serious. 

I knew at that moment that I had no choice. 

I had to prove that I wasn’t a liar. I had to prove that I wasn’t crazy. 

I had to prove to Mom and Dad that Mr. Mortman was a monster.

“What’s that?” I asked Aaron. 

It was a week later. I had to pass his house to get to the library for my 
Reading Rangers meeting. I stopped when I saw Aaron in the front yard. He was 
tossing a blue disc, then catching it when it snapped back at him. 

“It’s a sort of a Frisbee on a long rubber band,” he said. He tossed the disc 
and it snapped back fast. He missed it and it flew behind him, then snapped back 
again—and hit him in the back of the head. 

“That’s not how it’s supposed to work exactly,” he said, blushing. He 
started to untangle a knot in the thick rubber band. 

“Can I play with you?” I asked. 

He shook his head. “No. It’s for one person, see.” 

“It’s a one-person Frisbee?” I asked. 

“Yeah. Haven’t you seen the commercials on TV? You play it by yourself. 
You throw it and then you catch it.” 

“But what if someone wants to play with you?” I demanded. 

“You can’t,” Aaron answered. “It doesn’t work that way.” 

I thought it was pretty dumb. But Aaron seemed to be having a good time. 
So I said goodbye and continued on to the library. 

It was a beautiful, sunny day. Everything seemed bright and cheerful, 
golden and summer green. 

The library, as usual, was bathed in blue shadows. I’d only been back once 
since that day. Once very quickly, to get my Rollerblades. I stopped at the curb, 
staring up at it. I felt a sudden chill. 

The whole world seemed to grow darker here. Darker and colder. 

Just my imagination? 

We’ll see, I thought. We’ll see today what’s real and what isn’t. 

I pulled my backpack off my shoulders and, swinging it by the straps, made 
my way to the front door. Taking a deep breath, I pushed open the door and 
stepped inside. 

Perched over his desk in the main reading room, Mr. Mortman was just 
finishing with another Reading Rangers member. It was a girl I knew from 
school, Ellen Borders. 



I watched from the end of a long row of books. Mr. Mortman was saying 
good-bye. He handed her a gold star. Then he shook Ellen’s hand, and I could 
see her try not to make a disgusted face. His hand was probably sopping wet, as 
usual. 

She said something, and they both laughed. Very jolly. 

Ellen said good-bye and headed toward the doorway. I stepped out to greet 
her. “What book did you get?” I asked after we had said our hellos. 

She held it up for me. “It’s called White Fang,” she said. 

“It’s about a monster?” I guessed. 

She laughed. “No, Lucy. It’s about a dog.” 

I thought I saw Mr. Mortman’s head lift up when I said the word monster. 

But I might’ve imagined that. 

I chatted a short while longer with Ellen, who was three books ahead of me 
this summer. She had only one more to read to get her prize. What a show-off. 

I heard the front door close behind her as I took my seat next to Mr. 
Mortman’s desk and pulled Frankenstein from my bookbag. 

“Did you enjoy it?” Mr. Mortman asked. He had been studying his turtles, 
but he turned to face me, a friendly smile on his face. 

He was wearing another turtleneck, a bright yellow one this time. I noticed 
that he wore a big, purple ring on one of his pudgy pink fingers. He twirled the 
ring as he smiled at me. 

“It was kind of hard,” I said. “But I liked it.” 

I had read more than half of this one. I would have finished it if it didn’t 
have such tiny type. 

“Did you enjoy the description in this book, too?” Mr. Mortman asked, 
leaning closer to me over the desk. 

My eye caught the big jar of flies on the shelf behind him. It was very full. 

“Well, yeah,” I said. “I kind of expected more action.” 

“What was your favorite part of the book?” Mr. Mortman asked. 

“The monster!” I answered instantly. 

I watched his face to see if he reacted to that word. But he didn’t even 
blink. His tiny black eyes remained locked on mine. 

“The monster was really great,” I said. I decided to test him. “Wouldn’t it 
be neat if there were real monsters, Mr. Mortman?” 

Again he didn’t blink. “Most people wouldn’t be too happy about that,” he 
said quietly, twirling his purple ring. “Most people like to get their scares in 



books or in movies. They don’t want their scares to be in real life.” He chuckled. 

I forced myself to chuckle, too. 

I took a deep breath and continued my little test. I was trying to get him to 
make a slip, to reveal that he wasn’t really human. “Do you believe that real 
monsters exist?” I asked. 

Not very subtle. I admit it. 

But he didn’t seem to notice. 

“Do I believe that a scientist such as Dr. Frankenstein could build a living 
monster?” Mr. Mortman asked. He shook his round, bald head. “We can build 
robots, but not living creatures.” 

That wasn’t what I meant. 

Some other people came into the library. A little girl with her white-haired 
grandmother. The little girl went skipping to the children’s book section. The 
grandmother picked up a newspaper and carried it to an armchair across the 
room. 

I was very unhappy to see them. I knew that the librarian wouldn’t change 
into a monster while they were here. I was sure he only ate flies when the library 
was empty. I was going to have to hide somewhere and wait for them to leave. 

Mr. Mortman reached into his desk drawer, pulled out a gold star, and 
handed it to me. I thought he was going to shake my hand, but he didn’t. “Have 
you read Anne of Green Gables ?” he asked, picking up a book from the pile on 
his desk. 

“No,” I said. “Does it have monsters in it?” 

He threw back his head and laughed, his chins quivering. 

I thought I caught a flash of recognition in his eyes. A question. A tiny 
moment of hesitation. 

I thought my question brought something strange to his eyes. 

But, of course, again it could have been my imagination. 

“I don’t think you’ll find any monsters in this one,” he said, still chuckling. 
He stamped it with his rubber stamp and handed it to me. The cover was moist 
from where his fingers had been. 

I made an appointment for the same time next week. Then I walked out of 
the main reading room and pretended to leave the library. 

I pulled open the front door and let it slam, but I didn’t go out. Instead, I 
crept back, keeping in the shadows. I stopped at the back wall, hidden by a long 
row of bookshelves. 



Where to hide? 

I had to find a safe hiding place. Safe from Mr. Mortman’s beady eyes. And 
safe from anyone else who might enter the library. 

What was my plan? 

Well, I’d been thinking about it all week. But I really didn’t have much of a 
plan. I just wanted to catch him in the act, that’s all. 

I wanted to see clearly. I wanted to erase all doubts from my mind. 

My plan was to hide until the library was empty, to spy on Mr. Mortman, to 
watch him change into a monster and eat flies again. 

Then I’d know I wasn’t crazy. Then I’d know my eyes hadn’t been playing 
tricks on me. 

On the other side of the room, I could hear the little girl’s grandmother 
calling to Mr. Mortman. “Do you have any spelling books? Samantha only likes 
picture books. But I want her to learn to spell.” 

“Grandma, whisper!” Samantha called harshly. “This is a library, 
remember! Whisper!” 

My eyes searched the long, dark shelves for a hiding place. And there it 
was. A low bookshelf along the floor near the back was empty. It formed a 
narrow cave that I could crawl into. 

Trying to be as silent as I could, I got down on my knees, sat down on the 
shelf, turned, slid my body back, and tucked myself in. 

It wasn’t really large enough to stretch out. I had to keep my legs folded. 
My head was pressed hard against the upright board. Not very comfortable. I 
knew I couldn’t stay like this forever. 

But it was late afternoon. Maybe Samantha and her grandmother would 
leave soon. Maybe I wouldn’t have to stay tucked on the shelf like a moldy old 
book for very long. 

My heart was pounding. I could hear Mr. Mortman talking softly to 
Samantha. I could hear the rustle of the old lady’s newspaper. I could hear the 
tick-tick-tick of the big wall clock on the front wall. 

I could hear every sound, every creak and groan. 

I suddenly had to sneeze. My nose tickled like crazy! There was so much 
dust down here. 

I reached up and squeezed my nose hard between my thumb and forefinger. 
Somehow I managed to shut off the sneeze. 

My heart was pounding even harder. I could hear it over the tick-tick-tick of 



the clock. 

Please leave, I thought, wishing Samantha and her grandmother out of 
there. 

Please leave. Please leave. Please leave. 

I don’t know how long I can stay tucked on this dusty shelf. 

My neck was already starting to hurt from being pressed against the shelf. 
And I felt another sneeze coming on. 

“This book is too hard. I need an easier one,” Samantha was saying to Mr. 
Mortman. 

I heard Mr. Mortman mutter something. I heard shuffling feet. Footsteps. 

Were they coming this way? 

Were they going to see me? 

No. They turned and headed back to the children’s section on the side. 

“I’ve already read this one,” I heard Samantha complain. 

Please leave. Please leave. Please leave. 

It must have been only a few minutes later when Samantha and her 
grandmother left, but it seemed like hours to me. 

My neck was stiff. My back ached. My legs were tingling, both asleep. 

I heard the front door close behind them. 

The library was empty now. Except for Mr. Mortman and me. 

I waited. And listened. 

I heard the scrape of his tall stool against the floor. Then I heard his 
footsteps. He coughed. 

It suddenly grew darker. He was turning off the lights. 

It’s show time! I thought. 

He’s closing up. Now’s the time. Now’s the time he’ll turn into a monster 
before my eyes. 

I rolled silently off the shelf, onto the floor. Then I pulled myself to a 
standing position. Holding onto a higher shelf, I raised one leg, then the other, 
trying to get the circulation back. 

As the overhead lights went out, most of the library was blanketed in 
darkness. The only light came from the late afternoon sunlight flooding through 
the window at the front of the room. 

Where was Mr. Mortman? 

I heard him cough again. Then he began to hum to himself. 

He was closing up. 



Holding my breath, I tiptoed closer to his desk. I leaned my side against the 
shelves as I moved, keeping in the shadows. 

Whoa. 

I suddenly realized Mr. Mortman wasn’t at his desk. 

I heard his footsteps behind me, at the back of the main reading room. Then 
I heard his shoes thud across the floor of the front entryway. 

I froze in place, listening hard, still holding my breath. 

Was he leaving? 

No. 

I heard a loud click. 

The sound of a lock being turned. 

He had locked the front door! 

I hadn’t planned on that. No way. That was definitely not part of my plan. 
Frozen in the dark aisle, I realized that I was locked in with him! 

Now what? 



8 


Maybe my plan wasn’t exactly the best plan in the world. 

Maybe the whole idea was stupid. 

You can bet I had plenty of doubts racing through my mind as I heard Mr. 
Mortman return to the main reading room. 

My plan, of course, was to prove to myself that I was right, that he was a 
monster. And then—to run out of the library! 

The plan wasn’t to be locked in that dark, creepy building with him, unable 
to escape. 

But here I was. 

So far, I was okay. He had no idea that anyone else was here with him. No 
idea that he was being spied on. 

Pressed against the tall shelves, I crept along the narrow aisle until I was as 
close as I dared to go. I could see his entire desk, caught in a deep orange 
rectangle of light from the high window. 

Mr. Mortman stepped behind his desk, humming softly to himself. He 
straightened a stack of books, then shoved it to a corner of the desk. 

He pulled open his desk drawer and shuffled things around, searching for 
something in there. 

I crept a little closer. I could see very clearly now. The afternoon sunlight 
made everything orangey-red. 

Mr. Mortman tugged at the neck of his turtle-neck. He rolled some pencils 
off the desktop into the open desk drawer. Then he shut the drawer. 

This is boring, I thought. 

This is very boring. And normal. 

I must have been wrong last week. I must have imagined the whole thing. 

Mr. Mortman is just a funny little man. He isn’t a monster at all. 

I sank against the tall shelf, disappointed. 

I’d wasted all this time, hiding on that filthy shelf—for nothing. 

And now here I was, locked in the library after closing time, watching the 
librarian clean off his desk. 

What a thrill! 



I’ve got to get out of here, I thought. I’ve been really stupid. 

But then I saw Mr. Mortman reach for the fly jar on the shelf behind him. 

I swallowed hard. My heart gave a sudden lurch. 

A smile crossed Mr. Mortman’s pudgy face as he set the big glass jar down 
in front of him. Then he reached across the desk and, with both hands, pulled the 
rectangular turtle pan closer. 

“Dinnertime, my timid friends,” he said in his high, scratchy voice. He 
grinned down at the turtles. He reached into the pan and splashed the water a bit. 
“Dinnertime, friends,” he repeated. 

And, then, as I stared without blinking, stared with my jaw dropping lower 
and lower in disbelief, his face began to change again. 

His round head began to swell up. 

His black eyes bulged. 

His mouth grew until it became an open black pit. 

The enormous head bobbed above the yellow turtleneck. The eyes swam in 
front of the head. The mouth twisted, opening and closing like an enormous fish 
mouth. 

I was right! I realized. 

Mr. Mortman is a monster! 

I knew I was right! But no one would believe me. 

TheyTl have to believe me now, I told myself. I’m seeing this so clearly. It’s 
all so bright in the red-orange light. 

I’m seeing it. I’m not imagining it. 

TheyTl have to believe me now. 

And as I gaped openmouthed at the gross creature the librarian had become, 
he reached into the fly jar, removed a handful of flies, and shoved them hungrily 
into his mouth. 

“Dinnertime,” he rasped, talking as he chewed. 

I could hear the buzz of the flies inside the jar. 

They were alive ! The flies were alive, and he was gobbling them up as if 
they were candy. 

I raised my hands and pressed them against the sides of my face as I stared. 

“Dinnertime!” 

Another handful of flies. 

Some of them had escaped. They buzzed loudly around his swollen, 
bobbing head. 



As he chewed and swallowed, Mr. Mortman grabbed at the flies in the air, 
his tiny hands surprisingly quick. He pulled flies out of the air—one, another, 
another—and popped them into his enormous gorge of a mouth. 

Mr. Mortman’s eyes swam out in front of his face. 

For a short, terrifying moment, the eyes stopped. They were staring right at 

me! 

I realized I had leaned too far into the aisle. 

Had he spotted me? 

I jumped back with a gasp of panic. 

The bulging black eyes, like undulating toadstools, remained in place for 
another second or two. Then they continued rolling and swimming about. 

After a third handful of flies, Mr. Mortman closed the jar, licking his black 
lips with a snakelike, pencil-thin tongue. 

The buzzing stopped. 

The room was silent again except for the ticking clock and my thundering 
heartbeats. 

Now what? I thought. 

Is that it? 

No. 

“Dinnertime, my timid friends,” the librarian said in a thin, trembling voice, 
the voice seeming to bob along with the enormous head. 

He reached a hand into the pan and picked up one of the little green-shelled 
turtles. I could see the turtle’s legs racing. 

Is he going to feed some flies to the turtles now? I wondered. 

Mr. Mortman held the turtle higher, studying it with his bulging, rolling 
eyes. He held it up to the sunlight. The turtle’s legs continued to move. 

Then he popped the turtle into his mouth. 

I heard the crack of the shell as Mr. Mortman bit down. 

He chewed noisily, several times, making a loud crunch with each chew. 
Then I saw him swallow once, twice, till he got it down. 

I’d seen enough. 

More than enough. 

I turned away. I began to make my way blindly back through the dark aisle. 
I jogged quickly. I didn’t really care if he heard me or not. 

I just had to get out of there. 

Out into the sunlight and fresh air. 



Away from the crunching sound that kept repeating in my ears. The crunch 
of the turtle shell as Mr. Mortman chewed it and chewed it. 

Chewed it alive. 

I ran from the main reading room, my heart thudding, my legs feeling 
heavy as stone. 

I was gasping for breath when I reached the front entry. I ran to the door 
and grabbed the handle. 

And then remembered. 

The door was locked. 

I couldn’t get out. 

I was locked in. 

And, then, as I stood staring straight ahead at the closed door, my hand 
gripping the brass knob, I heard footsteps. Behind me. Rapid footsteps. 

Mr. Mortman had heard me. 

I was trapped. 



9 


I froze in panic, staring at the door until it became a dark blur in front of me. 

Mr. Mortman’s footsteps grew louder behind me. 

Help! I uttered a silent plea. Somebody —help me! 

The librarian would burst into the front entry-way any second. And there 
I’d be. Trapped at the door. 

Trapped like a rat. Or like a turtle! 

And then what? 

Would he grab me up like one of his pets? 

Would he crunch me between his teeth? 

There had to be a way out of there. There had to be! 

And, then, staring at the blur of the door, it suddenly came clear to me. It all 
came back in focus. And I realized that maybe—just maybe—I wasn’t trapped at 
all. 

Mr. Mortman had locked the door from the inside. 

The inside. 

That meant that maybe I could unlock it and open the door. 

If the door locked with a key, then I was stuck. 

But if it was just an ordinary lock that you turned... 

“Hey, is someone out there?” Mr. Mortman’s raspy voice burst into my 
thoughts. 

My eyes frantically searched the door. I found the lock under the brass 
knob. 

I reached for it. 

Please turn. Please turn. Please turn. 

The lock turned in my hand with a soft click. The prettiest sound I ever 
heard! 

In a second, I had pulled open the door. In another second, I was out on the 
stone steps. Then, I was running as fast as I could, running across the front lawn, 
cutting through some shrubs, diving through a hedge—running for my life! 

Gasping for air, I turned halfway down the block. I could see Mr. Mortman, 
a shadowy figure in the library door. He was standing in the doorway, staring 



out, not moving. Just standing there. 

Had he seen me? 

Did he know it was me spying on him? 

I didn’t want to know. I just wanted to get away. 

The late afternoon sun was ducking behind the trees, making the shadows 
long and dark. I lowered my head and ran into the long, blue shadows, my 
sneakers thudding hard against the sidewalk. 

I was out. I was okay. I had seen the monster, but he hadn’t seen me. I 
hoped. 

I ran until I got to Aaron’s house. He was still in the front yard. He was 
sitting on the stump of an old tree his parents had removed. I could see the blue 
Frisbee-type thing in his lap. He was struggling to untangle the long rubber 
band. 

Aaron had his head down, concentrating on undoing the knots, and didn’t 
see me at first. 

“Aaron—Mr. Mortman is a monster!” I cried breathlessly. 

“Huh?” He looked up, startled. 

“Mr. Mortman—he’s a monster!” I repeated, panting like a dog. I put my 
hands on my knees and leaned forward, trying to catch my breath. 

“Lucy, what’s your problem?” Aaron muttered, returning his attention to the 
mbber band. 

“Listen to me!” I screamed impatiently. I didn’t sound like myself. I didn’t 
recognize my shrill, panicky voice. 

“This thing stinks,” Aaron muttered. “It’s totally tangled.” 

“Aaron, please !” I pleaded. “I was in the library. I saw him. He changed 
into a monster. He ate one of his turtles! ” 

Aaron laughed. “Yum!” he said. “Did you bring me one?” 

“Aaron, it isn’t funny!” I cried, still out of breath. “I—I was so scared. He’s 
a monster. He really is. I thought I was locked in with him. I thought—” 

“Tell you what,” Aaron said, still picking at the knots in the rubber band. 
He held the blue plastic disc up to me. “If you can untangle this big knot, I’ll let 
you play with it.” 

“Aaaaaagh!” I let out an angry scream. “Why don’t you listen to me?” 

“Lucy, give me a break,” Aaron said, still holding the disc up to me. “I 
don’t want to talk about monsters now. It’s kind of babyish, you know?” 

“But, Aaron!” 



“Why don’t you save that stuff for Randy?” Aaron suggested. He waved the 
blue disc. “Do you want to help me with this or not?” 

“Not!” I screamed. Then I added: “You’re a lousy friend!” 

He looked a little surprised. 

I didn’t wait for him to say anything else. I took off again, heading for 
home. 

I was really angry. What was his problem, anyway? You’re supposed to 
take a friend seriously. You’re not supposed to think automatically that your 
friend is just making up a story. 

Couldn’t Aaron see how frightened and upset I was? Couldn’t he see that it 
wasn’t a joke? 

He’s a total jerk, I decided, as my house finally came into view. I’m never 
speaking to him again. 

I ran up the driveway, pulled open the screen door, and burst into the house. 
“Mom! Dad!” My heart was pounding so hard, my mouth was so dry, my cry 
was a hoarse whisper. 

“Mom—where are you?” 

I ran through the house until I found Randy in the den. He was lying on the 
floor, his face two inches in front of the TV, watching a Bugs Bunny cartoon. 

“Where are Mom and Dad?” I cried breathlessly. 

He ignored me. Just stared at his cartoon. The colors from the TV danced 
over his face. 

“Randy—where are they?” I repeated frantically. 

“Grocery shopping,” he muttered without turning around. 

“But I have to talk to them!” I said. “When did they leave? When will they 
be back?” 

He shrugged without removing his eyes from the screen. “I don’t know.” 

“But, Randy!” 

“Leave me alone,” he whined. “I’m watching a cartoon.” 

“But I saw a monster!” I screamed. “Areal one!” 

His eyes went wide. His mouth dropped open. “A real monster?” he 
stammered. 

“Yes!” I cried. 

“Did he follow you home?” Randy asked, turning pale. 

“I hope not!” I exclaimed. I wheeled around and ran out of the den. I 
glanced out the living room window as I hurried past. No sign of my parents’ car. 



So I ran up to my room. 

I was so upset. So angry and upset. 

I took two steps into my room, then stopped. 

There in my bed, under the covers, lay a big, hairy monster, its gnarled 
brown head on my pillow, its gaping, toothless mouth twisted in an evil grin. 



10 


I grabbed the top of my dresser and uttered a loud gasp of shock. 

The monster stared at me, one round eye bigger than the other. It didn’t 
move off my pillow. 

It uttered a high-pitched giggle. 

I mean, I thought it giggled. It took me a short while to realize that the 
giggling was coming from behind me. 

I spun around to see Randy just outside the door. When he saw the terrified 
look on my face, his giggle became a roar of laughter. 

“Like it?” he asked, stepping past me into the room and walking up to my 
bed. “I made it in art class.” 

“Huh?” 

Randy picked up the lumpy brown monster head. As soon as he picked it 
up, I saw that the hair was brown yarn, that the face was painted on. 

“It’s papier-mache,” Randy announced proudly. “Neat, huh?” 

I let out a long sigh and slumped onto the edge of the bed. “Yeah. Neat,” I 
muttered unhappily. 

“I put the pillows under your covers to make it look like he had a body,” 
Randy continued, grinning. His grin looked a lot like the grin on the monster 
head. 

“Very clever,” I said bitterly. “Listen, Randy, I just had a really scary thing 
happen. And I’m really not in the mood for jokes.” 

His grin grew wider. He tossed the brown monster head at me. 

I caught it and held it in my lap. He motioned for me to toss it back, but I 
didn’t. 

“Didn’t you hear me?” I cried. “I’m very upset. I saw a monster. A real one. 
In the library.” 

“You’re just embarrassed because my monster head fooled you,” Randy 
said. “You’re mad because I really scared you.” 

“Mr. Mortman is a monster,” I told him, bouncing the monster head in my 
lap. “I saw him change into a monster. His head grew big, and his eyes popped 
out, and his mouth twisted open.” 

“Stop it!” Randy cried, starting to look scared. 



“I saw him eat flies,” I continued. “Handfuls of flies.” 

“Flies?” Randy asked. “Yuck!” 

“And then I saw him pick up one of his pet turtles. You know. The ones he 
keeps in that pan on his desk. I saw him pop it in his mouth and eat it.” 

Randy shuddered. He stared at me thoughtfully. For a moment, I thought 
maybe he believed me. But then his expression changed, and he shook his head. 

“No way, Lucy. You’re just mad because I scared you for once. So now 
you’re trying to scare me. But it isn’t going to work.” 

Randy grabbed the monster head from my lap and started out the door. “I 
don’t believe you about Mr. Mortman.” 

“But it’s true!” I protested shrilly. 

“I’m missing my cartoons,” he said. 

Just then, I heard a knock at the front door. 

“Mom!” I cried. I leapt off the bed and went tearing to the stairs. I shoved 
Randy out of my way, and practically flew down the steps, taking them three at a 
time. 

“Mom! Dad—you’re home! I have to tell you—” 

I froze in front of the screen door. 

It wasn’t my parents. 

It was Mr. Mortman. 



11 


My first thought was to run. 

My next thought was to slam the front door. 

My next thought was to run back upstairs and hide in my room. 

But it was too late to hide. Mr. Mortman had already seen me. He was 
staring at me through the screen door with those beady black eyes, an evil, thin¬ 
lipped smile on his pale, round face. 

He saw me, I realized. 

He saw me spying on him in the library. 

He saw me running away. 

He knows that I know his secret. He knows that I know he’s a monster. 

And he’s come to get me. 

He’s come to get rid of me, to make sure his secret is safe. 

“Lucy?” he called. 

I stared at him through the screen. 

I could see in his eyes that he knew it had been me in the library. 

The sun had nearly gone down. The sky behind him was sunset-purple. His 
face looked even paler than usual in the evening light. 

“Lucy, hi. It’s me,” he said. 

He was waiting for me to say something. But I was frozen there in panic, 
trying to decide whether to run or scream. Or both. 

Randy had stopped halfway down the stairs. “Who is it?” he asked. 

“It’s Mr. Mortman,” I replied softly. 

“Oh.” That was what my little brother said. He came the rest of the way 
down, then walked past me on his way back to the den. 

“Hi, Mr. Mortman,” I managed to say, not moving any closer to the door. 
Then I blurted out, “My parents aren’t home.” 

I knew instantly that it was a dumb thing to say. 

Now the monster knew that Randy and I were here alone. 

Why did I say that? I asked myself. How could I be so stupid? 

“I didn’t come to see your parents,” Mr. Mortman said softly. “I came to see 
you, Lucy.” 



He knows! I thought. He really knows! 

I’m dead meat! 

I swallowed hard. I didn’t know what to say. My eyes searched the front 
hallway for a weapon, something to hit him with when he broke through the 
screen door and came after me. 

Mr. Mortman’s eyes narrowed. His smile faded. 

This is it! I thought. 

There was nothing around that I could use to fight him off. A little glass 
flower vase. That’s all I could see. I didn’t think it would be too effective against 
a roaring monster. 

“Lucy, I believe this belongs to you,” Mr. Mortman said. He held up my 
blue canvas backpack. 

“Huh?” 

“I found it back in the stacks,” Mr. Mortman said, his smile returning. “I 
didn’t know who had left it. But I found your name and address on the tag here.” 

“You—you mean—?” I stammered. 

“I always walk home after I close the library, so I thought I’d bring it to 
you,” he said. 

Was this a trap? 

I studied his face warily. I couldn’t tell what he was thinking. 

I had no choice. I pushed open the screen door, and he handed me the 
backpack. “Wow. Thanks,” I said. “That was really nice of you.” 

He straightened the sleeves of his yellow turtleneck. “Well, I figured you’d 
probably want to get started on Anne of Green Gables tonight,” he said. 

“Yeah. Sure,” I replied uncertainly. 

“I guess you ran out of the library pretty quickly,” Mr. Mortman said, 
staring into my eyes. 

“Uh... yeah. I had to get home,” I told him, glancing back to the den. The 
cartoon music floated into the hallway. 

“So you didn’t wait around or anything after our appointment?” he asked. 

Does he know ? I wonder. 

Or is he just trying to find out if it was me or not? 

“No,” I said, trying to keep my voice from shaking. “I ran right out. I was in 
a hurry. I—I guess that’s why I forgot my bag.” 

“Oh, I see,” Mr. Mortman replied thoughtfully, rubbing his chins. 

“Why?” I blurted out. 



The question seemed to surprise him. “Oh, it’s nothing, really,” he said. “I 
think someone was playing a trick on me. Staying in the library after closing.” 

“Really?” I asked, opening my eyes wide and trying to sound as innocent as 
possible. “Why would they do that?” 

“To scare me,” Mr. Mortman answered, chuckling. “Some kids don’t have 
anything better to do than try to scare the kindly old librarian.” 

But you’re not a kindly old librarian, I thought. You’re a monster! 

“I got up to look around,” Mr. Mortman continued, “and whoever it was 
high-tailed it.” He chuckled again. 

“I wouldn’t want to be locked in there overnight,” I said, studying his face, 
hoping my innocent act was working. 

“Neither would I!” he exclaimed. “It’s a pretty creepy old building! 
Sometimes I get so scared from all the strange creaks and groans.” 

Yeah. Sure! I thought sarcastically. 

Behind him, I saw my parents’ car turn into the driveway. I breathed a silent 
sigh of relief. Thank goodness they were finally home! 

“Guess I’ll say good night,” Mr. Mortman said pleasantly. He turned and 
watched as my parents rolled past him up the driveway, heading to the back of 
the house. 

“Thanks for bringing the bag,” I said, eager to go greet Mom and Dad. 

“No problem. See you next week.” He hurried away. 

I went running to the kitchen. Mom was just coming in through the kitchen 
door, carrying a brown grocery bag. “Wasn’t that Mr. Mortman at the front 
door?” she asked, surprised. 

“Yeah,” I answered eagerly. “I’m so glad to see you, Mom. I have to tell 
you—” 

“What did he want?” Mom interrupted. 

“He... uh... returned my backpack. I left it at the library, see. I have to tell 
you about him, Mom. He—” 

“That was really nice of him,” Mom said, setting the grocery bag down on 
the counter. “How come you forgot it, Lucy?” 

“I ran out of there really fast, Mom. You see—” 

“Well, that was really nice of Mr. Mortman,” she interrupted again. She 
started to remove things from the grocery bag. “He doesn’t live in this direction. 
I think he lives way over on the north side.” 

“Mom, I’m trying to tell you something!” I cried impatiently. My hands 



were balled into tight fists. My heart was pounding. “Mr. Mortman is a 
monster!” 

“Huh?” She turned away from the counter and stared at me. 

“He’s a monster, Mom! Areal one!” I cried. 

“Lucy, Lucy.” She shook her head. “You see monsters everywhere.” 

“Mom!” 

“Stop it, Lucy. Stop being dumb. I hope you were polite to Mr. Mortman.” 
“Mo-om!” 

“Enough. Go outside and help your father bring in the rest of the groceries.” 



12 


So, once again my wonderful parents refused to believe me. 

I tried to describe what I had seen from my hiding place in the library. But 
Mom just shook her head. Dad said I had a great imagination. Even Randy 
refused to be scared. He told Mom and Dad how he had scared me with his 
stupid papier-mache monster head. 

I practically begged them to believe me. 

But Mom said I was just lazy. She said I was making up the story about Mr. 
Mortman so I could get out of the Reading Rangers program and wouldn’t have 
to read any more books this summer. 

When she said that, I got really insulted, of course. I yelled something back. 
And it ended up with all of us growling and snapping at each other, followed by 
me storming up to my room. 

Slumped unhappily on my bed, I thought hard about my predicament. 

I could see that they were never going to believe me. 

I had told too many monster stories, played too many monster jokes. 

So, I realized, I needed someone else to tell my parents about Mr. Mortman. 
I needed someone else to see Mr. Mortman become a monster. I needed someone 
else to believe the truth with me. 

Aaron. 

If Aaron came along with me and hid in the library and saw Mr. Mortman 
eat flies and turtles with his bulging head—then Aaron could tell my parents. 

And they’d believe Aaron. 

They had no reason not to believe Aaron. He was a serious, no-nonsense 
guy. My most serious, no-nonsense friend. 

Aaron was definitely the answer to my problem. 

Aaron would finally make my parents realize the truth about Mr. Mortman. 

I called him immediately. 

I told him I needed him to come hide in the library and spy on Mr. 
Mortman. 

“When?” he asked. “At your next Reading Rangers meeting?” 

“No. I can’t wait a whole week,” I said, whispering into the phone, even 
though my parents were downstairs and there was no one around. “How about 



tomorrow afternoon? Just before closing time. Around five.” 

“It’s too dumb,” Aaron insisted. “I don’t think I want to.” 

“HI pay you!” I blurted out. 

“How much?” he asked. 

What a friend! 

“Five dollars,” I said reluctantly. I never save much of my allowance. I 
wondered if I still had five dollars in my drawer. 

“Well, okay,” Aaron agreed. “Five dollars. In advance.” 

“And you’ll hide with me and then tell my parents everything you see?” I 
asked. 

“Yeah. Okay. But I still think it’s dumb.” He was silent for a moment. “And 
what if we get caught?” he asked after a while. 

“We’ll be careful,” I said, feeling a little chill of fear. 



13 


I spent most of the next day hanging around, teasing Randy. I couldn’t wait for 
the afternoon to roll around. 

I was so excited. And nervous. 

I had it all worked out. Aaron and I would sneak into the main reading 
room without Mr. Mortman knowing anyone had come in. We’d hide in the dark 
shelves, just as I had done. 

Then, when the librarian turned off the lights and closed up the library, 
we’d sneak up the aisle, keeping in the shadows, and watch him become a 
monster. 

Then we wouldn’t run out the way I had done. That was far too risky. We 
would go back to our hiding places in the low shelves and wait for Mr. Mortman 
to leave. Once he was gone, Aaron and I would let ourselves out of the library 
and hurry to my house to tell my parents what we had seen. 

Easy. Nothing to it, I kept telling myself. 

But I was so nervous, so eager to get it over with, I arrived at Aaron’s house 
an hour early. I rang the bell. 

No answer. 

I rang it again. 

Finally, after a long wait, Aaron’s teenage brother, Burt, pulled open the 
door. He had on blue denim shorts and no shirt. “Hi,” he said, scratching his 
chest. “You looking for Aaron?” 

“Yeah.” I nodded. 

“He isn’t home.” 

“Huh?” I practically fell off the porch. “Where is he? I mean, when will he 
be back?” 

“Don’t know. He went to the dentist,” Burt said, gazing past me to the 
street. 

“He did?” 

“Yeah. He had an appointment. With the orthodontist. He’s getting braces. 
Didn’t he tell you?” 

“No,” I said glumly. I could feel my heart sink to my knees. “I was 
supposed to meet him.” 



“Guess he forgot,” Burt said with a shrug. “You know Aaron. He never 
remembers stuff like that.” 

“Well. Thanks,” I muttered unhappily. I said good-bye and trudged back 
down to the sidewalk. 

That dirty traitor. 

I felt really betrayed. 

I had waited all day. I was so psyched for spying on Mr. Mortman. 

I had counted on Aaron. And all the while, he had a stupid orthodontist 
appointment. 

“I hope your braces really hurt!” I shouted out loud. 

I kicked a small rock across the sidewalk. I felt like kicking a lot of rocks. I 
felt like kicking Aaron. 

I turned and headed home, thinking all kinds of ugly thoughts. I was at the 
bottom of my driveway when an idea popped into my head. 

I didn’t need Aaron, I suddenly realized. 

I had a camera. 

My parents had given me a really good camera last Christmas. 

If I sneaked into the library with the camera and took a few snapshots of 
Mr. Mortman after he became a monster, the photos would be all the proof I 
needed. 

My parents would have to believe actual color snapshots. 

Forgetting my disappointment about Aaron, I hurried up to my room and 
pulled the camera off the shelf. It already had film in it. I had taken a bunch of 
shots at Randy’s birthday party just before school let out. 

I examined it carefully. There were still eight or nine shots left on the roll. 

That should be plenty to capture Mr. Mortman at his ugliest. 

I glanced at the clock on my desk. It was still early. A little after four-thirty. 
I had half an hour before the library closed. 

“This has got to work,” I said out loud, crossing my fingers on both hands. 

Then I strapped the camera around my neck and headed to the library. 

I entered the library silently and crept to the doorway of the main reading room. 
My plan was to sneak into the low shelf where I had hidden before. But I quickly 
saw that it wasn’t going to be as easy as I thought. 

The library was very crowded. There were several kids in the children’s 
book section. There were people thumbing through the magazines. One of the 



microfiche machines was being used against one wall. And several aisles, 
including the one with my special hiding place, had people in them, browsing 
and searching the shelves. 

I’ll just have to wait them out, I decided, turning and pretending to search 
one of the back shelves. 

I could see Mr. Mortman standing behind his desk. He was checking out a 
stack of books for a young woman, opening the covers, stamping the card, then 
slamming the covers shut. 

It was nearly five o’clock. Just about closing time. 

I crept along the back wall, searching for another hiding spot. Near the 
corner, I spotted a large wooden cabinet. I recognized it as I stepped behind it 
and lowered myself from view. It was the long, tall cabinet that held the card 
catalogue. 

It will hide me quite nicely, I thought. 

I hunched down behind the old cabinet and waited. Time dragged by. Every 
second seemed like an hour. 

At five-fifteen, Mr. Mortman was still checking out books for people. He 
announced closing time, but some of the magazine readers seemed very reluctant 
to leave. 

I felt myself getting more and more nervous. My hands were ice cold. The 
camera suddenly seemed to weigh a thousand pounds, like a dead weight around 
my neck. I removed it and dropped it to my lap. 

It will all be worth it, I kept repeating to myself. 

It will all be worth it if I get a good, clear shot of the monster. 

I leaned against the back of the cabinet and waited, my hand gripping the 
camera in my lap. 

Finally, the room emptied out. 

I climbed to my knees, suddenly very alert, as I heard the librarian go to 
lock the front door. A few seconds later, I heard him return to his desk. 

I stood up and peered around the side of the cabinet. He was busily 
shuffling papers, straightening his desk for the night. 

In a few minutes, I hoped, it would be feeding time. 

Monster time. 

Taking a deep breath, I gripped the camera tightly in one hand and, feeling 
my heart start to pound, began to make my way silently toward Mr. Mortman’s 
desk at the front of the room. 



14 


Everything seemed to be taking so long today. 

Was time really in slow motion? Or did everything seem so slow because 
my pulse was racing so fast? 

I was so eager to get my proof—and get out of there! 

But Mr. Mortman was taking his good old time. He shuffled through a stack 
of papers, reading some of them, folding some of them in half, and tossing them 
in the wire trash basket beside his desk. 

He hummed to himself as he read through the entire stack. Finally, he got to 
the bottom of the pile and tossed the final sheet away. 

Now! I thought. Now you’ll start your monster routine, won’t you, Mr. 
Mortman! 

But no. 

He lifted a stack of books from his desk and carried them to the shelves. 
Humming loudly, he began returning the books to their places. 

I pressed myself into the shadows, hoping he wouldn’t come to my row. I 
was near the far wall in front of the row of microfiche machines. 

Please, let’s get on with it! I begged silently. 

But when he finished with the first stack, Mr. Mortman returned to his desk 
and hoisted up another pile of books to replace. 

I’m going to be late for dinner, I realized with a growing sense of dread. My 
parents are going to kill me! 

The thought made me chuckle. Here I was, locked inside this creepy old 
library with a monster, and I was worried about getting scolded for being late for 
dinner! 

I could hear Mr. Mortman, but I couldn’t see him. He was somewhere 
among the rows of shelves, replacing books. 

Suddenly his humming grew louder. 

I realized he was in the next aisle. I could see him over the tops of the 
books on the shelf to my right. 

And that meant he could see me! 

Gripped with panic, I ducked and dropped to the floor. 

Had he heard me? Had he seen me? 



I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. 

He continued to hum to himself. The sound grew fainter as he moved in the 
other direction. 

Letting out a silent sigh of relief, I climbed back to my feet. Gripping the 
camera tightly in my right hand, I peered around the side of the shelf. 

I heard his shoes shuffling along the floor. He reappeared, his bald head 
shiny in the late afternoon sunlight from the window, and made his way slowly 
to his desk. 

The clock on the wall ticked noisily. 

My hand gripping the camera was cold and clammy. 

Watching him shuffle things around inside his desk drawer, I suddenly lost 
my nerve. 

This is stupid, I thought. A really bad idea. 

I’m going to be caught. 

As soon as I step out to snap the picture, he’ll see me. 

He’ll chase after me. He won’t let me get out of the library with this 
camera. 

He won’t let me get out of here alive. 

Turn and run! a voice inside my head commanded. 

Quick, while you have the chance—turn and run! 

Then another voice interrupted that one. He isn’t going to turn into a 
monster tonight, Lucy, the voice said. You’re wasting your time. You’re getting 
yourself all nervous and scared for no reason. 

My mind was spinning, whirring with voices and frightening thoughts. I 
leaned hard against the wooden shelf, steadying myself. I closed my eyes for a 
moment, trying to clear my head. 

How many shots can you take? a voice in my head asked. Can you shoot off 
three or four before he realizes what is happening? 

You only need one good shot, another voice told me. One good clear shot 
will be the proof you need. 

You’d better hope he’s humming very loudly, another voice said. Otherwise, 
he’ll hear your camera shutter click. 

Turn and run! another voice repeated. Turn and run! 

You only need one good shot. 

Don’t let him hear your shutter click. 

I stepped forward and peered around the shelf. 



Mr. Mortman, humming happily away, was reaching for the fly jar. 

Yes! I cried silently. Finally! 

“Dinnertime, my timid friends,” I heard him say in a pleasant singsong. 
And as he started to unscrew the jar lid, his head began to grow. 

His eyes bulged. His mouth twisted open and enlarged. 

In a few seconds, his monstrous head was bobbing above his shirt. His 
snakelike tongue flicked out of his black mouth as he removed the jar lid and 
pulled out a handful of flies. 

“Dinnertime, my timid friends!” 

Picture time! I thought, gathering my courage. 

I raised the camera to my eye with a trembling hand. I gripped it tightly 
with both hands to keep it from shaking. 

Then, holding my breath, I leaned as far forward as I could. 

Mr. Mortman was downing his first handful of flies, chewing noisily, 
humming as he chewed. 

I struggled to center him in the viewfinder. 

I was so nervous, the camera was shaking all over the place! 

I’m so glad he’s humming, I thought, raising my finger to the shutter 
button. 

He won’t hear the camera click. 

I’ll be able to take more than one shot. 

Okay. Okay... 

He was still enjoying his first batch of tender flies. 

Now! I told myself. 

I was about to push the button—when Mr. Mortman suddenly turned away. 

With a gasp, I stopped myself just in time. 

My pulse was pounding at my temples so hard, I could barely see straight. 

What was he doing? 

He was reaching for another jar. He set it down on his desk and unscrewed 
the lid. 

I raised the camera again and squinted at him through the viewfinder. 

What did he have in this jar? Something was fluttering in there. It took me a 
while to realize they were moths. White moths. 

He closed his fist around one and shoved it hungrily into his mouth. 
Another moth fluttered out of the jar before he could close the lid. 

Mr. Mortman’s eyes bulged like toadstools growing out of his balloonlike 



head. His mouth twisted and coiled as he chewed the moth. 

Taking another deep breath and holding it, I leaned forward as far as I 
could, steadied the camera in front of my eye—and snapped the shutter. 



15 


The FLASH! 

I had forgotten about the flash! 

I was so worried about the click of the shutter, I had totally forgotten that 
my camera had automatic flash! 

The instant flash of white light made Mr. Mortman cry out angrily. Startled, 
he raised his hands to cover his bulging eyes. 

I stood frozen in the aisle, frozen by carelessness, frozen by my stupidity! 

“Who’s there?” he growled, still covering his eyes. 

I realized he hadn’t seen me yet. Those big eyes must have been very 
sensitive to light. The flash had momentarily blinded him. 

He let out a monstrous roar that echoed off the four walls of the vast room. 

Somehow I revived my senses enough to pull myself back, out of view. 

“Who’s there?” he repeated, his voice a rasping snarl. “You won’t get 
away!” 

I saw him lumbering in my direction. As he lurched toward me, his body 
swayed awkwardly, as if his eyes were still blinded. 

I gaped in horror as he approached. 

He seemed steadier with each step. His bulging eyes searched the rows of 
shelves. He was breathing hard, each breath a furious growl. 

“Who’s there? Who’s there?” 

Get going! I told myself, still gripping the camera in both hands. Get going! 
What are you waiting for? 

“You won’t get away!” the monster cried. 

Oh, yes, I will! 

He was three rows away, his eyes peering down the dark aisles. Searching. 
Searching. 

He hadn’t seen me, I knew. The light of the flash had startled him, then 
blinded him. 

He didn’t know it was me. 

Now all I had to do was run. All I had to do was get out of there with the 
proof safely in my hands. 



So what was I waiting for? 

He lumbered closer. He was only a row away. 

Run! I ordered my paralyzed legs. Run! Don’t just stand there! 

I spun around, clumsily bumped into a shelf of books. Several books 
toppled to the floor. 

Run! Don’t stop! 

It was taking me so long to move. I was so weighed down by my fear. 

Run! Lucy! He’s right behind you! 

Finally, my legs started to cooperate. 

Holding the camera in one hand, I began to run through the dark aisle 
toward the back of the room. 

“You won’t get away!” the monster bellowed from the next aisle. “I hear 
you! I know where you are!” 

Uttering an animal cry of terror, I ran blindly to the end of the aisle, turned 
toward the doorway—and crashed into a low book cart. 

The cart toppled over as I fell on top of it. 

I landed hard on my stomach and knees. The camera bounced from my 
hand and slid across the floor. 

“I’ve got you now!” the monster growled, moving quickly from the next 


aisle. 



16 


I scrambled to get up, but my leg was caught in the cart. 

The monster lumbered toward me, panting loudly. 

Once again, my fear tried to paralyze me. I tried to push myself up with 
both hands, but my body felt as if it weighed a thousand pounds. 

I’m dead meat! I thought. 

Finally, I pushed myself up and freed myself from the cart. 

Dead meat. Dead meat. 

The panting, growling monster was only a few yards away now, lurching 
out of a row of shelves. 

I grabbed the camera and stumbled to the door, my knee throbbing, my 
head whirring. 

I’ll never make it. Never. 

And then I heard the loud electronic ringing. 

At first, I thought it was an alarm. 

But then I realized it was the telephone. 

I pulled myself into the doorway and turned. 

The monster hesitated at the end of the aisle. His bulbous, black eyes 
floated up above his face. His gaping mouth, drooling green liquid, twisted into 
an O of surprise. 

He stopped short, startled by the sudden interruption. 

Saved by the bell! I thought happily. I pulled open the heavy front door and 
burst out to freedom. 

I ran for two blocks, my sneakers slapping the pavement, my heart refusing 
to slow its frantic beat. I closed my eyes as I ran, enjoying the feel of the warm, 
fresh air on my face, the warmth of the late afternoon sun, the sweep of my hair 
flying behind me as I ran. Feeling free. Free and safe! 

When I opened my eyes and slowed my pace, I realized that I was gripping 
the camera so tightly, my hands hurt. 

My proof. I had my proof. 

One snapshot. One snapshot that nearly cost me my life. But I had it in the 
camera, my proof that Mr. Mortman was a monster. 



“I have to get it developed,” I said out loud. “Fast.” 

I jogged the rest of the way home, cradling the camera under my arm. 

As my house came into view, I had a chilling feeling that Mr. Mortman 
would be waiting there. That he would be waiting beside the front porch, waiting 
to grab the camera from me, to rob me of my proof. 

I hesitated at the bottom of the driveway. 

No one there. 

Was he hiding in the bushes? Around the side of the house? 

I walked up the front lawn slowly. You’re being stupid, I scolded myself. 
How could Mr. Mortman get here before you ? 

Besides, I wasn’t even sure he had recognized me. 

The lights were out in the library. The room was dark. The closest he had 
come was the aisle next to mine. And he was blinded for a long while from the 
camera flash. 

I started to breathe a little easier. Yes, it was possible that the librarian 
didn’t know who he was chasing. It was possible that he never got a good look at 
me at all. 

My dad’s car pulled up the drive as I reached the front porch. I went tearing 
after him, running around the side of the house to the back. 

“Dad! Hi!” I called as he climbed out of the car. 

“Hey, how’s it going?” he asked. His suit was rumpled. His hair was 
disheveled. He looked tired. 

“Dad, can we get this film developed—right away?” I demanded, shoving 
the camera toward him. 

“Whoa!” he cried. “I just got home. Let’s talk about it at dinner, okay?” 

“No, Dad—really!” I insisted. “I have to get this developed. There’s 
something very important on it.” 

He walked past me toward the house, his shoes crunching over the gravel 
driveway. 

I followed right behind, still holding my camera up high. “Please, Dad? It’s 
really important. Really really important!” 

He turned, chuckling. “What have you got? A picture of that boy who 
moved across the street?” 

“No,” I replied angrily. “I’m serious, Dad. Can’t you take me to the mall? 
There’s that one-hour developing place there.” 

“What’s so important?” he asked, his smile fading. He ran a hand over his 



head, smoothing down his thick, black hair. 

I had the urge to tell him. I had the urge to tell him I had a photo of the 
monster in there. But I stopped myself. 

I knew he wouldn’t believe me. I knew he wouldn’t take me seriously. 

And then he wouldn’t drive me to the mall to get my film developed. No 

way. 

“I’ll show it to you when it’s developed,” I said. 

He held open the screen door. We walked into the kitchen. Dad sniffed the 
air a couple of times, expecting the aroma of cooking food. 

Mom came bursting in from the hallway to greet us. “Don’t sniff,” she told 
my dad. “There’s nothing cooking. We’re eating out tonight.” 

“Great!” I cried. “Can we eat at the mall? At that Chinese restaurant you 
like?” I turned to my Dad. “Please? Please? Then I could get my film developed 
while we eat.” 

“I could go for Chinese food,” Mom said thoughtfully. Then she turned her 
gaze on me. “Why so eager to get your film developed?” 

“It’s a secret,” Dad said before I could reply. “She won’t tell.” 

I couldn’t hold it in any longer. “It’s a picture I snapped of Mr. Mortman,” I 
told them excitedly. “It’s my proof that he’s a monster.” 

Mom rolled her eyes. Dad shook his head. 

“It’s proof!” I insisted. “Maybe when you see the photo, you’ll finally 
believe me.” 

“You’re right,” Dad said sarcastically. “I’ll believe it when I see it.” 

“Randy! Hurry downstairs!” Mom shouted into the hallway. “We’re going 
to the mall for Chinese food!” 

“Aw, do we have to have Chinese food?” my brother called down 
unhappily. His standard reply. 

“I’ll get you the plain lo mein noodles you like,” Mom called up to him. 
“Just hurry. We’re all hungry.” 

I pushed the button on my camera to rewind the roll of film. “I’m going to 
drop this at the one-hour developing place before dinner,” I told them. “Then we 
can pick it up after dinner.” 

“No monster talk at dinner tonight—promise?” Mom said sternly. “I don’t 
want you scaring your brother.” 

“Promise,” I said, pulling the film roll out of the camera, squeezing it 
between my fingers. 



After dinner, I told myself, I won’t have to talk about monsters — I’ll show 
you one! 

Dinner seemed to take forever. 

Randy didn’t stop complaining the whole time. He said his noodles tasted 
funny. He said the spareribs were too greasy, and the soup was too hot. He 
spilled his glass of water all over the table. 

I barely paid any attention to what anyone said. I was thinking about my 
snapshot. I couldn’t wait to see it—and to show it to Mom and Dad. 

I could just imagine the looks on their faces when they saw that I was right, 
that I hadn’t been making it up—that Mr. Mortman really was a monster. 

I imagined both my parents apologizing to me, promising they’d never 
doubt me again. 

“I feel so bad,” I imagined my dad saying, “I’m going to buy you that 
computer you’ve been asking for.” 

“And a new bike,” I imagined Mom saying. “Please forgive us for doubting 
you.” 

“And I’m sorry, too,” I imagined Randy saying. “I know I’ve been a real 
jerk.” 

“And you can stay up till midnight every night from now on, even on 
school nights,” I imagined Dad saying. 

Suddenly, my mom’s voice broke into my daydreams. “Lucy, I don’t think 
you heard a word I said,” she scolded. 

“No... I... uh... was thinking about something,” I admitted. I picked up my 
chopsticks and raised a chunk of rice to my mouth. 

“She was thinking about monsters!” Randy cried, raising both hands up 
over the table, squeezing his fingers as if he were a monster about to attack me. 

“No monster talk!” Mom insisted sharply. 

“Don’t look at me!” I cried. “He said it—not me!” I pointed an accusing 
finger at Randy. 

“Just finish your dinner,” Dad said quietly. He had sparerib grease all over 
his chin. 

Finally, we were opening our fortune cookies. Mine said something about 
waiting for sunshine when the clouds part. I never get those fortunes. 

Dad paid the check. Randy nearly spilled another glass of water as we were 
standing up. I went running out of the restaurant. I was so excited, so eager, I 



couldn’t wait another second. 

The little photo store was on the upper level. I leapt onto the escalator, 
grabbed the rail, and rode to the top. Then I tore into the store, up to the counter, 
and called breathlessly to the young woman at the developing machine, “Are my 
photos ready yet?” 

She turned, startled by my loud voice. “I think so. What’s your name?” 

I told her. She walked over to a rack of yellow envelopes and began slowly 
shuffling through them. 

I tapped my fingers nervously on the counter-top, staring at the stack of 
yellow envelopes. Couldn’t she hurry it up a little? 

She shuffled all the way through the stack, then turned back to me. “What 
did you say your name was again?” 

Trying not to sound too exasperated, I told her my name again. I leaned 
eagerly on the counter-top, my heart pounding, and stared at her as she began 
once again to shuffle through the yellow envelopes, moving her lips as she read 
the names. 

Finally, she pulled one out and handed it to me. 

I grabbed it and started to tear it open. 

“That comes to fourteen dollars even,” she said. 

I realized I didn’t have any money. “I’ll have to get my dad,” I told her, not 
letting go of the precious package. 

I turned, and Dad appeared in the doorway. Mom and Randy waited 
outside. 

He paid. 

I carried the envelope of photos out of the store. My hands were shaking as 
I pulled it open and removed the snapshots. 

“Lucy, calm down,” Mom said, sounding worried. 

I stared down at the snapshots. All photos of Randy’s birthday party. 

I sifted through them quickly, staring at the grinning faces of Randy’s 
stupid friends. 

Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? 

Of course, it was the very last photo, the one on the bottom of the stack. 

“Here it is!” I cried. 

Mom and Dad leaned forward to see over my shoulder. 

The other photos fell from my hand and scattered over the floor as I raised 
the photo to my face— 



and gasped. 



17 


The photo was clear and sharp. 

Mr. Mortman’s large desk stood in the center in a burst of bright light. I 
could see papers on the desk, the pan of turtles at the far corner, a low pile of 
books. 

Behind the desk, I could see the top of Mr. Mortman’s tall wooden stool. 
And behind the stool, the shelves were in clear focus, even the glass jar of flies 
on the lower shelf. 

But there was no monster. 

No Mr. Mortman. 

No one. 

No one in the snapshot at all. 

“He—he was standing right there!” I cried. “Beside the desk!” 

“The room looks empty,” Dad said, staring down over my shoulder at the 
snapshot in my quivering hand. 

“There’s no one there,” Mom said, turning her gaze on me. 

“He was there,” I insisted, unable to take my eyes off the photo. “Right 
there.” I pointed to where the monster had stood. 

Randy laughed. “Let me see.” He pulled the photo from my hand and 
examined it. “I see him!” he declared. “He’s invisible!” 

“It isn’t funny,” I said weakly. I pulled the photo away from him. I sighed 
unhappily. I felt so bad. I wanted to sink into a hole in the floor and never come 
out. 

“He’s invisible!” Randy repeated gleefully, enjoying his own joke. 

Mom and Dad were staring at me, looks of concern on their faces. 

“Don’t you see?” I cried, waving the photo in one hand. “Don’t you see? 
This proves it! This proves he’s a monster. He doesn’t show up in photographs!” 

Dad shook his head and frowned. “Lucy, haven’t you carried this joke far 
enough?” 

Mom put a hand on my shoulder. “I’m starting to get worried about you,” 
she said softly. “I think you’re really starting to believe in your own monster 
joke.” 

“Can we get ice cream?” Randy asked. 



* * * 


“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Aaron complained. 

“Just shut up. You owe me!” I snapped. 

It was the next evening. We were crouched low, hiding behind the low 
shrubs at the side of the library. 

It was a crisp, cool day. The sun was already lowering itself behind the 
trees. The shadows stretched long and blue over the library lawn. 

“I owe you?” Aaron protested. “Are you crazy?” 

“You owe me,” I repeated. “You were supposed to come to the library with 
me yesterday, remember. You let me down.” 

He brushed a bug off his freckled nose. “Can I help it if I had an 
orthodontist appointment?” He sounded funny. His words were coming out all 
sticky. He wasn’t used to his new braces yet. 

“Yes,” I insisted. “I counted on you, and you let me down—and you got me 
in all kinds of trouble.” 

“What kind of trouble?” He dropped to the ground and sat cross-legged, 
keeping his head low behind the evergreen shrub. 

“My parents said I’m never again allowed to mention Mr. Mortman or the 
fact that he’s a monster,” I told him. 

“Good,” Aaron said. 

“Not good. It means I really need you, Aaron. I need you to see that I’m 
telling the truth, and tell my parents.” My voice broke. “They think I’m crazy. 
They really do!” 

He started to reply, but he could see I was really upset. So he stopped 
himself. 

A cool breeze swept past, making the trees all seem to whisper at us. 

I kept my eyes trained on the library door. It was five-twenty. Past closing 
time. Mr. Mortman should be coming out any second. 

“So we’re going to follow Mr. Mortman home?” Aaron asked, scratching 
the back of his. neck. “And spy on him at his house? Why don’t we just watch 
him through the library window?” 

“The window is too high,” I replied. “We have to follow him. He told me he 
walks home every evening. I want you to see him turn into a monster,” I said, 
staring straight ahead over the top of the bush. “I want you to believe me.” 



“What if I just say I believe you?” Aaron asked, grinning. “Then could we 
just go home?” 

“Ssshhh!” I pressed a hand over Aaron’s mouth. 

The library door was opening. Mr. Mortman appeared on the front steps. 

Aaron and I ducked down lower. 

I peered through the branches of the shrub. The librarian turned to lock the 
front door. He was wearing a red-and-white-striped short-sleeved sportshirt and 
baggy gray slacks. He had a red baseball cap on his bald head. 

“Stay far behind,” I whispered to Aaron. “Don’t let him see you.” 

“Good advice,” Aaron said sarcastically. 

We both shifted onto our knees and waited for Mr. Mortman to head down 
the sidewalk. He hesitated on the steps, replacing the keys in his pants pocket. 
Then, humming to himself, he walked down the driveway and turned away from 
us. 

“What’s he humming about?” Aaron whispered. 

“He always hums,” I whispered back. Mr. Mortman was more than half a 
block away. “Let’s go,” I said, climbing quickly to my feet. 

Keeping in the shadows of the trees and shrubs, I began following the 
librarian. Aaron followed just behind me. 

“Do you know where he lives?” Aaron asked. 

I turned back to him, frowning. “If I knew where he lived, we wouldn’t 
have to follow him—would we?” 

“Oh. Right.” 

Following someone was a lot harder than I thought. We had to cut through 
front yards. Some of them had barking dogs. Some had lawn sprinklers going. 
Some had thick hedges we somehow had to duck through. 

At every street corner, Mr. Mortman would stop and look both ways for 
oncoming cars. Each time, I was certain he was going to look over his shoulder, 
too, and see Aaron and me creeping along behind him. 

He lived farther from the library than I had thought. After several blocks, 
the houses ended, and a bare, flat field spread in front of us. 

Mr. Mortman cut through the field, walking quickly, swinging his stubby 
arms rhythmically with each step. We had no choice but to follow him across the 
field. There were no hiding place’s. No shrubs to duck behind. No hedges to 
shield us. 

We were completely out in the open. We just had to pray that he didn’t turn 



around in the middle of the field and see us. 

A block of small, older houses stood beyond the field. Most of the houses 
were brick, set close to the street on tiny front yards. 

Mr. Mortman turned onto a block of these houses. Aaron and I crouched 
behind a mailbox and watched him walk up to a house near the middle of the 
block. He stepped onto the small front stoop and fiddled in his pocket for the 
keys. 

“We’re here,” I whispered to Aaron. “We made it.” 

“My friend Ralph lives on this block, I think,” Aaron said. 

“Who cares?” I snapped. “Keep your mind on business, okay?” 

We waited until Mr. Mortman had disappeared through the front door of his 
house, then crept closer. 

His house was white clapboard, badly in need of a paint job. He had a small 
rectangle of a front yard, with recently cut grass bordered by a single row of tall, 
yellow tiger lilies. 

Aaron and I made our way quickly to the side of the house where there was 
a narrow strip of grass that led to the back. The window near the front of the 
house was high enough for us to stand under and not be seen. 

A light came on in the window. “That must be his living room,” I 
whispered. 

Aaron had a frightened expression. His freckles seemed a lot paler than 
usual. “I don’t like this,” he said. 

“The hard part was following him,” I assured Aaron. “This part is easy. We 
just watch him through the window.” 

“But the window is too high,” Aaron pointed out. “We can’t see anything.” 

He was right. Staring up from beneath the window, all I could see was the 
living room ceiling. 

“We’ll have to stand on something,” I said. 

“Huh? What?” 

I could see Aaron was going to be no help. He was so frightened, his nose 
was twitching like a bunny rabbit’s. I decided if I could keep him busy, maybe I 
could keep him from totally freaking and mnning away. 

“Go in back. See if there’s a ladder or something,” I whispered, motioning 
toward the back of the house. 

Another light came on, this one in a back window. Probably the kitchen, I 
figured. It was also too high to see into. 



“Wait. What about that?” Aaron asked. I followed his gaze to a 
wheelbarrow, tilted against the side of the house. 

“Yeah. Maybe,” I said. “Bring it over. I’ll try to stand on it.” 

Keeping his head and shoulders bent low, Aaron scampered over to the 
wheelbarrow. He lifted it away from the house by the handles, then pushed it 
under the front window. 

“Hold it steady,” I said. 

He grabbed the wooden handles, gazing up at me fearfully. “You sure about 
this?” 

“I’ll give it a try,” I said, glancing up at the high window. 

Holding onto Aaron’s shoulder, I gave myself a boost onto the 
wheelbarrow. He held firmly to the handles as I struggled to find my balance 
inside the metal basket part. 

“It—it’s kind of tilty,” I whispered, pressing one hand against the side of 
the house to steady myself. 

“I’m doing the best I can,” Aaron grumbled. 

“There. I think I can stand,” I said. I wasn’t very high off the ground, but I 
wasn’t at all comfortable. A wheelbarrow is a difficult thing to stand on. 

Somewhere down the block a dog barked. I hoped he wasn’t barking 
because of Aaron and me. 

Another dog, closer to us, quickly joined in, and it became a barking 
conversation. 

“Are you high enough? Can you see anything?” Aaron asked. 

One hand still pressed against the side of the house, I raised my head and 
peered into the house through the bottom of the window. 

“Yeah. I can see some,” I called down. “There’s a big aquarium in front of 
the window, but I can see most of the living room.” 

And just as I said that, Mr. Mortman’s face loomed inches from mine. 

He was staring right at me! 



18 


I gasped and lost my balance. 

I toppled to the ground, knocking over the wheelbarrow, landing hard on 
my knees and elbows. “Ow!” 

“What happened?” Aaron cried, alarmed. 

“He saw me!” I choked out, waiting for the pain to stop throbbing. 

“Huh?” Aaron’s mouth dropped open. 

We both gazed up at the window. I expected to see Mr. Mortman staring 
down at us. 

But no. No sign of him. 

I climbed quickly to my feet. “Maybe he was looking at his aquarium,” I 
whispered, motioning for Aaron to set up the wheelbarrow. “Maybe he didn’t see 
me.” 

“Wh-what are you going to do?” Aaron stammered. 

“Get back up, of course,” I told him. My legs were shaking as I climbed 
back onto the wheelbarrow. I grabbed the window ledge and pulled myself up. 

The sun had nearly gone down. The darkness outside made it easier to see 
inside the house. And, I hoped, harder for Mr. Mortman to see out. 

I didn’t have the best view in the world, I quickly realized. The aquarium, 
crowded with colorful tropical fish, blocked my view of most of the room. 

If only I were a little higher, I thought, I could see over it. But if I had been 
higher, I realized, Mr. Mortman would have seen me. 

“What’s he doing?” Aaron asked in a trembling whisper. 

“Nothing. He’s... wait!” 

Mr. Mortman was staring down at the fish. He stood only a few feet from 
me, on the other side of the aquarium. 

I froze, pressing my hands against the side of the house. 

He gazed down into his aquarium, and a smile formed on his pudgy face. 
He had removed the red baseball cap. His bald head looked yellow in the living 
room lamplight. 

His mouth moved. He was saying something to the tropical fish in the 
aquarium. I couldn’t hear him through the glass. 

Then, as he smiled down at his fish, he began to change. 



“He’s doing it,” I whispered to Aaron. “He’s turning into a monster.” 

As I watched Mr. Mortman’s head inflate and his eyes bulge out, I was 
filled with all kinds of strange feelings. I was terrified. And I was fascinated. It 
was exciting to be so close, inches away from a real monster. 

And I felt so happy and relieved that Aaron would finally see for himself 
that I was telling the truth. 

Then, as Mr. Mortman’s mouth grew wider and began to gyrate, a twisting 
black hole on his swollen, yellow face, fear overtook me. I froze there, my face 
pressed against the window, not blinking, not moving. 

I stared as he reached a hand into the aquarium. 

His fat fingers wrapped around a slender blue fish. He pulled it up and 
flipped it into his mouth. I could see long, yellow teeth inside the enormous 
mouth, biting down, chewing the wriggling fish. 

Then, as I gaped in growing terror, Mr. Mortman pulled a black snail off the 
side of the aquarium glass. Holding its shell between his fingertips, he stuffed 
the snail into his mouth. His teeth crunched down hard on the shell, cracking it— 
a crack so loud, I could hear it through the window glass. 

My stomach churned. I felt sick. 

He swallowed the snail, then reached to pull another one off the aquarium 
glass. 

“I think I’m going to toss my lunch,” I whispered down to Aaron. 

Aaron. 

I had forgotten all about him. 

I was so fascinated by the monster, so excited, so terrified to watch him 
close up, I had forgotten the whole purpose of being here. 

“Aaron, help me down,” I whispered. “Quick.” 

Still staring through the window, I reached a hand down for Aaron to take 
it. 

“Aaron—hurry! Help me down so you can climb up here. You have to see 
this! You have to see the monster!” 

He didn’t reply. 

“Aaron? Aaron?” 

I lowered my eyes from the window. 

Aaron had disappeared. 



19 


I felt a stab of panic in my chest. 

My entire body convulsed in a tremor of cold fear. 

Where was he? 

Had he run away? 

Was Aaron so frightened that he just took off without telling me? 

Or had something happened to him? Something really bad? 

“Aaron? Aaron?” In my panic, I forgot that I was inches away from a 
monster, and started to shout. “Aaron? Where are you?” 

“Ssh,” I heard a whisper from the back of the house. Aaron appeared, 
making his way quickly toward me along the narrow strip of grass. “I’m right 
here, Lucy.” 

“Huh? Where’d you go?” 

He pointed to the back. “I thought maybe I could find a ladder or 
something. You know. So I could see, too.” 

“You scared me to death!” I cried. 

I returned my glance to the window. Mr. Mortman was sucking a slithering 
eel into his mouth like a strand of spaghetti. 

“Quick, Aaron—help me down,” I instructed, still feeling shaken from the 
scare of his disappearance. “You have to see this. You have to. Before he 
changes back.” 

“He—he’s really a monster?” Aaron’s mouth dropped open. “You’re not 
joking?” 

“Just get up here!” I cried impatiently. 

But as I tried to lower myself to the ground, the wheelbarrow slid out from 
under me. 

It toppled onto its side, the handles scraping the side of the house. 

My hands shot up to grab the windowsill. I missed and fell heavily on top 
of the wheelbarrow. “Ow!” I cried out as sharp pain cut through my side. 

Glancing up, I saw the monster’s startled face, goggling down at me 
through the glass. 

I scrambled to get up. But the throbbing pain in my side took my breath 
away. 



“Aaron—help me! ” 

But he was already running to the street, his sneakers scraping the grass, his 
arms stretched straight in front of him as if trying to grab onto safety. 

Ignoring the pain in my side, I scrambled to my feet. 

I took an unsteady step, then another. I shook my head, trying to shake 
away my dizziness. 

Then I sucked in a deep breath and started to run, following Aaron toward 
the street. 

I had gone about four or five steps when I felt Mr. Mortman’s surprisingly 
strong hands grab my shoulders from behind. 



20 


I tried to scream, but no sound came out. 

He held firmly onto my shoulders. I could feel his hot, wet hands through 
my T-shirt. 

I tried to pull away, but he was too strong. 

He spun me around. 

His face was back to normal. 

He squinted at me with those little black eyes, as if he couldn’t believe what 
he was seeing. “Lucy!” he exclaimed in his scratchy voice. 

He let go of my shoulders and stepped back. 

I was panting loudly. I was so frightened, my chest felt about to explode. 

How had he changed back from his monster form so quickly? 

What was he going to do to me? 

“Lucy, good heavens. I thought you were a burglar,” he said, shaking his 
head. He removed a white handkerchief from his back pocket and wiped his 
perspiring forehead. 

“S-sorry,” I stammered. My voice came out in a choked whisper. 

He balled up the handkerchief between his fat hands and jammed it back 
into his pocket. “What are you doing here?” 

“Well...” My heart was pounding so hard, I could feel the blood pulse at 
my temples. My side still ached from where I had fallen on the wheelbarrow. 

I struggled to clear my mind. I had to think of an answer to his question. I 
had to. 

“Well...” I started again, thinking desperately. “I... uh... came to tell you 
that I’ll_uh... be a little late for my Reading Rangers appointment tomorrow.” 

He narrowed his eyes and stared at me thoughtfully. “But why were you 
looking through my window?” he demanded. 

“Well... I just...” 

Think, Lucy — think! 

“I didn’t know if you were home or not. I just was trying to see if you were 
there. I mean. So I could tell you. About the appointment tomorrow.” 

Staring into his face, trying to sound sincere, I took a step back, in case I 



had to make a run for it. 

Did he believe me? 

Was he buying it? 

I couldn’t tell. He continued to stare at me thoughtfully. 

He rubbed his chins. “You really didn’t have to come all the way out here,” 
he said softly. “Did you ride your bike?” His eyes darted over the small front 
lawn. 

“No. I... uh... walked. I like to walk,” I replied awkwardly. 

“It’s getting dark,” he said. “Maybe you should call your mom or dad to 
come pick you up. Why don’t you come inside and use the phone?” 

Come inside? 

Come inside the monster’s house? 

No way! 

“Uh... no thanks, Mr. Mortman,” I said, taking another step backwards 
toward the street. “My parents don’t mind if I walk home. It isn’t that far. 
Really.” 

“No. I insist,” he said, an odd grin starting across his molelike face. He 
motioned toward the house. “Come on in, Lucy. The phone is in the living 
room,” he urged. “Come on. I won’t bite.” 

I shuddered. 

I’d just seen him bite snails. And eels. 

There was no way I was going in that house. I knew that if I went in, 
chances are I’d never come out. 

“I—I’ve got to go,” I said, giving him a wave of one hand. I could feel the 
fear creeping up my back, running over my body. I knew if I didn’t get away 
from there —that moment —I’d be frozen by my terror, unable to escape. 

“Lucy—” Mr. Mortman insisted. 

“No. Really. Bye, Mr. Mortman.” I waved again, turned, and started jogging 
to the street. 

“You really shouldn’t have come all this way!” he called after me in his 
high, scratchy voice. “Really. You shouldn’t have!” 

I know! I thought. I know I shouldn’t have. 

I trotted along the street, turned the corner, and continued down the next 
block. 

Was I really getting away? 

Was he really letting me go? 



I couldn’t believe he’d bought my lame excuse. 

Why was he letting me get away? 

I slowed to a walk. My side still ached. I suddenly had a throbbing 
headache. 

Night had fallen. Passing cars had their headlights on. A slender trail of 
dark cloud drifted over a pale half-moon still low in the purple-gray sky. 

I was about to cross the street onto the broad, empty field when hands 
grabbed my shoulders again. 

I cried out, more of a yelp than a scream, and spun around, expecting to see 
the monster. 

“Aaron!” I cried. I swallowed hard, trying to force down my fear. “Where 

_ ?” 

“I waited for you,” he said. His voice trembled. 

His hands were knotted into fists. He looked about ready to burst into tears. 

“Aaron—” 

“I’ve been waiting all this time,” he said shrilly. “Where’ve you been? I’ve 
been so scared.” 

“I was... back there,” I told him. 

“I was ready to call the police or something,” Aaron said. “I was hiding 
down the block. I—” 

“You saw him?” I asked eagerly, suddenly remembering why we had risked 
our lives tonight. “You saw Mr. Mortman?” 

Aaron shook his head. “No, I didn’t. I was too far away.” 

“But earlier,” I said. “Through the window. When he was a monster. Didn’t 
you see him then? Didn’t you see him eat the snails and the eels?” 

Aaron shook his head again. “I didn’t see anything, Lucy,” he said softly. 
“I’m sorry. I wish I had.” 

Big help, I thought bitterly. 

Now what was I going to do? 



21 


“Mom—you don’t understand. I can’t go!” 

“Lucy, I’m not giving you a choice. You’re going, and that’s that.” 

It was the next afternoon, a stormy, gray day, and Mom and I were in the 
kitchen, arguing. I was trying to tell her there was no way I could go to my 
Reading Rangers meeting at the library. And she was insisting that I had to go. 

“Mom, you’ve got to believe me,” I pleaded. I was trying not to whine, but 
my voice kept creeping higher and higher. “Mr. Mortman is a monster. I can’t go 
to the library anymore.” 

Mom made a disgusted face and tossed down the dish towel she’d been 
folding. “Lucy, your father and I have had it up to here with your silly monster 
stories.” 

She turned to face me. Her expression was angry. “The fact is, Lucy dear, 
that you are a quitter. You never stick with anything. You’re lazy. That’s your 
problem.” 

“Mr. Mortman is a monster,” I interrupted. “That’s my problem.” 

“Well, I don’t care,” Mom replied sharply. “I don’t care if he turns into a 
drooling werewolf at night. You’re not quitting Reading Rangers. You’re going 
to your appointment this afternoon if I have to take you by the hand and walk 
you there myself.” 

“Gee—would you?” I asked. 

The idea flashed into my head that Mom could hide in the stacks and see 
for herself when Mr. Mortman turned into a monster. 

But I guess she thought I was being sarcastic. She just scowled and walked 
out of the kitchen. 

And so, an hour later, I was trudging up the stone steps to the old library. It 
was raining hard, but I didn’t take an umbrella. I didn’t care if I got drenched. 

My hair was soaked and matted on my head. I shook my head hard as I 
stepped into the entry-way, sending drops of water flying in all directions. 

I shivered, more from my fear, from being back in this frightening place, 
than from the cold. I pulled off my backpack. It was dripping wet, too. 

How can I face Mr. Mortman? I wondered as I made my way reluctantly 
into the main reading room. How can I face him after last night? 



He must surely suspect that I know his secret. 

He couldn X have believed me last night, could he? 

I was so furious at my mom for forcing me to come here. 

I hope he turns into a monster and chews me to bits! I thought bitterly. That 
will really teach Mom a lesson. 

I pictured Mom and Dad and Randy, sitting mournfully in our living room, 
crying their eyes out, wailing, “If only we had believed her! If only we had 
listened!” 

Holding my wet backpack in front of me like a shield, I made my way 
slowly past the long rows of books to the front of the room. 

To my relief, there were several people in the library. I saw two little kids 
with their mothers and a couple of other women browsing in the mystery book 
section. 

Great! I thought, starting to feel a little calmer. Mr. Mortman won’t dare do 
anything while the library is filled with people. 

The librarian was dressed in a green turtleneck today, which really made 
him look like a big, round turtle. He was stamping a stack of books and didn’t 
look up as I stepped close to the desk. 

I cleared my throat nervously. “Mr. Mortman?” 

It took him a long while to look up. When he finally did, a warm smile 
formed above his chins. “Hi, Lucy. Give me a few minutes, okay?” 

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll go dry off.” 

He seems very friendly, I thought, heading over to a chair at one of the long 
tables. He doesn’t seem angry at all. 

Maybe he really did believe my story last night. 

Maybe he really doesn’t know that I’ve seen him turn into a monster. 

Maybe I’ll get out of here alive.... 

I sat down at the table and shook some more water from my hair. I stared at 
the big, round wall clock, nervously waiting for him to call me up for our 
meeting. The clock ticked noisily. Each second seemed to take a minute. 

The kids with their mothers checked out some books and left. I turned to 
the mystery section and saw that the two women had also cleared out. The 
librarian and I were the only ones left. 

Mr. Mortman shoved a stack of books across his desk and stood up. “I’ll be 
right back, Lucy,” he said, another friendly, reassuring smile on his face. “Then 
we’ll have our meeting.” 



He stepped away from his desk and, walking briskly, headed to the back of 
the reading room. I guessed he was going to the bathroom or something. 

A jagged flash of white lightning flickered across the dark sky outside the 
window. It was followed by a drumroll of thunder. 

I stood up from the table and, carrying my wet backpack by the straps, 
started toward Mr. Mortman’s desk. 

I was halfway to the desk when I heard the loud click. 

I knew at once that he had locked the front door. 

A few seconds later, he returned, walking briskly, still smiling. He was 
mbbing his pudgy white hands together as he walked. 

“Shall we talk about your book?” he asked, stepping up to me. 

“Mr. Mortman—you locked the front door,” I said, swallowing hard. 

His smile didn’t fade. 

His dark little eyes locked on mine. 

“Yes. Of course,” he said softly, studying my face. His hands were still 
clasped together in front of him. 

“But—why?” I stammered. 

He brought his face close to mine, and his smile faded. “I know why you 
were at my house last night,” he growled into my ear. “I know everything.” 

“But, Mr. Mortman, I—” 

“I’m sorry,” he said in his throaty growl. “But I can’t let you leave, Lucy. I 
can’t let you leave the library.” 



22 


“Ohhh.” The sound escaped my lips, a moan of total terror. 

I stared at him without moving. I guess I wanted to see if he was serious or 
not. If he really meant what he said. 

His eyes told me he did. 

And as I stared at him, his head began to inflate. His tiny, round eyes shot 
out of their sockets and grew into throbbing, black bulbs. 

“Ohhh.” 

Again, the terrified sound escaped my lips. My entire body convulsed in a 
shudder of terror. 

His head was throbbing now, throbbing like a heart. His mouth opened into 
a gaping, gruesome leer, and green spittle ran down his quivering chin. 

Move! I told myself. Move, Lucy! DO something! 

His disgusting grin grew wider. His enormous head bobbed and throbbed 
excitedly. 

He uttered a low growl of attack. And reached out both arms to grab me. 

“No!” I shrieked. 

I leaned back and, with all my might, swung the backpack into his flabby 
stomach. 

It caught him by surprise. 

He gasped as it took his breath away. 

I let go of the backpack, spun around, and started to run. 

He was right behind me. I could hear his panting breath and low, menacing 
growls. 

I ran through a narrow aisle between two tall shelves. 

A rumble of thunder from outside seemed to shake the room. 

He was still behind me. Close. Closer. 

He was going to catch me, going to grab me from behind. 

I reached the end of the row. I hesitated. I didn’t know which way to turn. I 
couldn’t think. 

He roared, a monstrous animal sound. 

I turned left and started to run along the back wall of the room. 



Another rumble of thunder. 

“Ohh!” I realized to my horror that I’d made a mistake. 

A fatal mistake. 

I was running right into the corner. 

There was no exit here. No escape. 

He roared again, so loud that it drowned out the thunder. 

I was trapped. 

I knew it. 

Trapped. 

With a desperate cry, I ran blindly—headlong into the card catalogue. 
Behind me, I heard the monster’s roar of laughter. 

He knew he had won. 



23 


The card catalogue toppled over. Drawers came sliding out. Cards spilled at my 
feet, scattering over the floor. 

“Noooo!” the monster howled. At first I thought it was a victory cry. But 
then I realized it was an angry cry of protest. 

With a moan of horror, he stooped to the floor and began gathering up the 
cards. 

Staring in disbelief, I plunged past him, running frantically, my arms 
thrashing wildly at my sides. 

In that moment of terror, I remembered the one thing that librarians hate 
most: having cards from the card catalogue spilled on the floor! 

Mr. Mortman was a monster—but he was also a librarian. 

He couldn’t bear to have those cards in disorder. He had to try to replace 
them before chasing after me. 

It took only seconds to run into the front entryway, turn the lock, pull open 
the door, and flee out into the rain. 

My sneakers slapped the pavement as I ran, sending up splashes of 
rainwater. 

I made my way to the street and was halfway up the block when I realized 
he was chasing after me. 

A flash of lightning crackled to my left. 

I cried out, startled, as a deafening burst of thunder shook the ground. 

I glanced back to see how close the monster was. 

And stopped. 

With trembling hands, I frantically brushed a glaze of rainwater from my 

eyes. 

“Aaron!” I cried. “What are you doing here?” 

He ran up to me, hunching against the cold rain. He was breathing hard. His 
eyes were wide and frightened. “I—I was in the library,” he stammered, 
struggling to catch his breath. “Hiding. I saw it. I saw the monster. I saw 
everything.” 

“You did?” I was so happy. I wanted to hug him. 

A sheet of rain swept over us, driven by a gust of wind. 



“Let’s get to my house!” I cried. “You can tell my parents. Now maybe 
they’ll finally believe it!” 


* * * 


Aaron and I burst into the den. Mom looked up from the couch, lowering the 
newspaper to her lap. “You’re dripping on the mg,” she said. 

“Where’s Dad? Is he home yet?” I asked, rainwater running down my 
forehead. Aaron and I were soaked from head to foot. 

“Here I am.” He appeared behind us. He had changed out of his work 
clothes. “What’s all the excitement?” 

“It’s about the monster!” I blurted out. “Mr. Mortman—he—” 

Mom shook her head and started to raise a hand to stop me. 

But Aaron quickly came to my rescue. “I saw him, too!” Aaron exclaimed. 
“Lucy didn’t make it up. It’s true!” 

Mom and Dad listened to Aaron. I knew they would. 

He told them what he had seen in the library. He told them how the librarian 
had turned into a monster and chased me into the corner. 

Mom listened intently to Aaron’s story, shaking her head. “I guess Lucy’s 
story is true,” she said when Aaron had finished. 

“Yeah. I guess it is,” Dad said, putting a hand gently on my shoulder. 

“Well, now that you finally believe me—what are you going to do, Dad?” I 
demanded. 

He gazed at me thoughtfully. “We’ll invite Mr. Mortman for dinner,” he 

said. 

“Huh?” I goggled at him, rainwater running down my face. “You’ll what? 
He tried to gobble me up! You can’t invite him here!” I protested. “You can’t!” 
“Lucy, we have no choice,” Dad insisted. “We’ll invite him for dinner.” 



24 


Mr. Mortman arrived a few evenings later, carrying a bouquet of flowers. He was 
wearing lime-green trousers and a bright yellow, short-sleeved sport shirt. 

Mom accepted the flowers from him and led him into the living room 
where Dad, Randy, and I were waiting. I gripped the back of a chair tightly as he 
entered. My legs felt rubbery, and my stomach felt as if I’d swallowed a heavy 
rock. 

I still couldn’t believe that Dad had invited Mr. Mortman into our house! 

Dad stepped forward to shake hands with the librarian. “We’ve been 
meaning to invite you for quite a while,” Dad told him, smiling. “We want to 
thank you for the excellent reading program at the library.” 

“Yes,” Mom joined in. “It’s really meant a lot to Lucy.” 

Mr. Mortman glanced at me uncertainly. I could see that he was studying 
my expression. “I’m glad,” he said, forcing a tight-lipped smile. 

Mr. Mortman lowered himself onto the couch. Mom offered him a tray of 
crackers with cheese on them. He took one and chewed on it delicately. 

Randy sat down on the rug. I was still standing behind the armchair, 
gripping the back of it so tightly, my hands ached. I had never been so nervous in 
all my life. 

Mr. Mortman seemed nervous, too. When Dad handed him a glass of iced 
tea, Mr. Mortman spilled a little on his trousers. “It’s such a humid day,” he said. 
“This iced tea hits the spot.” 

“Being a librarian must be interesting work,” Mom said, taking a seat 
beside Mr. Mortman on the couch. 

Dad was standing at the side of the couch. 

They chatted for a while. As they talked, Mr. Mortman kept darting glances 
at me. Randy, sitting cross-legged on the floor, drummed his fingers on the 
carpet. 

Mom and Dad seemed calm and perfectly at ease. Mr. Mortman seemed a 
little uncomfortable. He had glistening beads of perspiration on his shiny, round 
forehead. 

My stomach growled loudly, more from nervousness than from hunger. No 
one seemed to hear it. 



The three adults chatted a while longer. Mr. Mortman sipped his iced tea. 

He leaned back on the couch and smiled at my mother. “It was so kind of 
you to invite me. I don’t get too many home-cooked meals. What’s for dinner?” 
he asked. 

“You are!” my Dad told him, stepping in front of the couch. 

“What?” Mr. Mortman raised a hand behind his ear. “I didn’t hear you 
correctly. What is for dinner?” 

“You are!” Dad repeated. 

“Ulllp!” Mr. Mortman let out a little cry and turned bright red. He struggled 
to raise himself from the low couch. 

But Mom and Dad were too fast for him. 

They both pounced on him. Their fangs popped down. And they gobbled 
the librarian up in less than a minute, bones and all. 

Randy laughed gleefully. 

I had a big smile on my face. 

My brother and I haven’t gotten our fangs yet. That’s why we couldn’t join 
in. 

“Well, that’s that,” Mom said, standing up and straightening the couch 
cushion. Then she turned to Randy and me. “That’s the first monster to come to 
Timberland Falls in nearly twenty years,” she told us. “That’s why it took us so 
long to believe you, Lucy.” 

“You sure gobbled him up fast!” I exclaimed. 

“In a few years, you’ll get your fangs,” Mom said. 

“Me, too!” Randy declared. “Then maybe I won’t be afraid of monsters 
anymore!” 

Mom and Dad chuckled. Then Mom’s expression turned serious. “You both 
understand why we had to do that, don’t you? We can’t allow any other monsters 
in town. It would frighten the whole community. And we don’t want people to 
get frightened and chase us away. We like it here!” 

Dad burped loudly. “Pardon me,” he said, covering his mouth. 

Later that night, I was upstairs in Randy’s room. He was all tucked in, and I was 
telling him a bedtime story. 

“...And so the librarian hid behind the tall bookshelf,” I said in a low, 
whispery voice. “And when the little boy named Randy reached up to pull a 
book down from the shelf, the librarian stuck his long arms through the shelf and 



grabbed the boy, and—” 

“Lucy, how many times do I have to tell you?” 

I glanced up to see Mom standing in the doorway, a frown on her face. 

“I don’t want you frightening your little brother before bedtime,” Mom 
scolded. “You’ll give him nightmares. Now, come on, Lucy—no more monster 
stories!” 





WELCOME TO 
CAMP NIGHTMARE 
Goosebumps - 09 
R.L. Stine 



1 


I stared out the dusty window as the camp bus bounced over the narrow, winding 
road. I could see sloping red hills in the distance beneath a bright yellow sky. 

Stumpy white trees lined the road like fence posts. We were way out in the 
wilderness. We hadnt passed a house or a farm for nearly an hour. 

The bus seats were made of hard blue plastic. When the bus hit a bump, we 
all bounced up off our seats. Everyone laughed and shouted. The driver kept 
growling at us, yelling for us to pipe down. 

There were twenty-two kids going to camp on the bus. I was sitting in the 
back row on the aisle, so I could count them all. 

There were eighteen boys and only four girls. I guessed that the boys were 
all going to Camp Nightmoon, which is where I was going. The girls were going 
to a girls camp nearby. 

The girls sat together in the front rows and talked quietly to each other. 
Every once in a while, theyd glance back quickly to check out the boys. 

The boys were a lot louder than the girls, cracking jokes, laughing, making 
funny noises, shouting out dumb things. It was a long bus ride, but we were 
having a good time. 

The boy next to me was named Mike. He had the window seat. Mike 
looked a little like a bulldog. He was kind of chubby, with a round face and 
pudgy arms and legs. He had short, spiky black hair, which he scratched a lot. 
He was wearing baggy brown shorts and a sleeveless green T-shirt. 

We had been sitting together the whole trip, but Mike didnt say much. I 
figured he was shy, or maybe very nervous. He told me this was his first time at 
sleepaway camp. 

It was my first time, too. And I have to admit that, as the bus took me 
farther and farther from my home, I was already starting to miss my mom and 
dad just a little. 

Im twelve, but Ive never really stayed away from home before. Even 
though the long bus ride was fun, I had this sad kind of feeling. And I think 
Mike was feeling the same way. 

He pressed his chubby face against the window glass and stared out at the 
red hills rolling by in the distance. 



Are you okay, Mike? I asked. 

Yeah. Sure, Billy, he replied quickly without turning around. 

I thought about my mom and dad. Back at the bus station, they had seemed 
so serious. I guess they were nervous, too, about me going off to camp for the 
first time. 

Well write every day, Dad said. 

Do your best, Mom said, hugging me harder than usual. 

What a weird thing to say. Why didnt she say, Have a good time? Why did 
she say, Do your best? 

As you can tell, Im a bit of a worrier. 

The only other boys Id met so far were the two in the seat in front of us. 
One was named Colin. He had long brown hair down to his collar, and he wore 
silver sunglasses so you couldnt see his eyes. He acted kind of tough, and he 
wore a red bandanna on his forehead. He kept tying and untying the bandanna. 

Sitting next to him in the seat on the aisle was a big, loud kid named Jay. 
Jay talked a lot about sports and kept bragging about what a good athlete he was. 
He liked showing off his big, muscular arms, especially when one of the girls 
turned around to check us out. 

Jay teased Colin a lot and kept wrestling with him, gripping Colins head in 
a headlock and messing up Colins bandanna. You know. Just kidding around. 

Jay had wild, bushy red hair that looked as if it had never been brushed. He 
had big blue eyes. He never stopped grinning and horsing around. He spent the 
whole trip telling gross jokes and shouting things at the girls. 

Heywhats your name? Jay called to a blond-haired girl who sat at the front 
by the window. 

She ignored him for a long time. But the fourth time Jay called out the 
question, she turned around, her green eyes flashing. Dawn, she replied. Then 
she pointed to the red-haired girl next to her. And this is my friend Dori. 

Heythats amazing! My name is Dawn, too! Jay joked. 

A lot of the guys laughed, but Dawn didnt crack a smile. Nice to meet you, 
Dawn, she called back to him. Then she turned around to the front. 

The bus bounced over a hole in the road, and we all bounced with it. 

Hey, look, Billy, Mike said suddenly, pointing out the window. 

Mike hadnt said anything for a long time. I leaned toward the window, 
trying to see what he was pointing at. 

I think I saw a prairie cat, he said, still staring hard. 



Huh? Really? I saw a clump of low white trees and a lot of jagged red 
rocks. But I couldnt see any prairie cats. 

It went behind those rocks, Mike said, still pointing. Then he turned toward 
me. Have you seen any towns or anything? 

I shook my head. Just desert. 

But isnt the camp supposed to be near a town? Mike looked worried. 

I dont think so, I told him. My dad told me that Camp Nightmoon is past 
the desert, way out in the woods. 

Mike thought about this for a while, frowning. Well, what if we want to call 
home or something? he asked. 

They probably have phones at the camp, I told him. 

I glanced up in time to see Jay toss something up toward the girls at the 
front. It looked like a green ball. It hit Dawn on the back of the head and stuck in 
her blond hair. 

Hey! Dawn cried out angrily. She pulled the sticky green ball from her hair. 
What is this? She turned to glare at Jay. 

Jay giggled his high-pitched giggle. I dont know. I found it stuck under the 
seat! he called to her. 

Dawn scowled at him and heaved the green ball back. It missed Jay and hit 
the rear window, where it stuck with a loud plop. 

Everyone laughed. Dawn and her friend Dori made faces at Jay. 

Colin fiddled with his red bandanna. Jay slumped down low and raised his 
knees against the seat in front of him. 

A few rows ahead of me, two grinning boys were singing a song we all 
knew but with really gross words replacing the original words. 

A few other kids began to sing along. 

Suddenly, without warning, the bus squealed to a stop, the tires skidding 
loudly over the road. 

We all cried out in surprise. I bounced off my seat, and my chest hit the seat 
in front of me. 

Ugh! That hurt. 

As I slid back in the seat, my heart still pounding, the bus driver stood up 
and turned to us, leaning heavily into the aisle. 

Ohh! Several loud gasps filled the bus as we saw the drivers face. 

His head was enormous and pink, topped with a mop of wild bright blue 
hair that stood straight up. He had long, pointed ears. His huge red eyeballs 



bulged out from their dark sockets, bouncing in front of his snoutlike nose. 
Sharp white fangs drooped from his gaping mouth. A green liquid oozed over his 
heavy black lips. 

As we goggled in silent horror, the driver tilted back his monstrous head 
and uttered an animal roar. 



2 


The driver roared so loud, the bus windows rattled. 

Several kids shrieked in fright. 

Mike and I both ducked down low, hiding behind the seat in front of us. 

Hes turned into a monster! Mike whispered, his eyes wide with fear. 

Then we heard laughter at the front of the bus. 

I raised myself up in time to see the bus driver reach one hand up to his 
bright blue hair. He tuggedand his face slid right off! 

Ohhh! Several kids shrieked in horror. 

But we quickly realized that the face dangling from the drivers hand was a 
mask. He had been wearing a rubber monster mask. 

His real face was perfectly normal, I saw with relief. He had pale skin, 
short, thinning black hair, and tiny blue eyes. He laughed, shaking his head, 
enjoying his joke. 

This fools em every time! he declared, holding up the ugly mask. 

A few kids laughed along with him. But most of us were too surprised and 
confused to think it was funny. 

Suddenly, his expression changed. Everybody out! he ordered gruffly. 

He pulled a lever and the door slid open with a whoosh. 

Where are we? someone called out. 

But the driver ignored the question. He tossed the mask onto the drivers 
seat. Then, lowering his head so he wouldnt bump the roof, he quickly made his 
way out the door. 

I leaned across Mike and stared out the window, but I couldnt see much. 
Just mile after mile of flat yellow ground, broken occasionally by clumps of red 
rock. It looked like a desert. 

Why are we getting out here? Mike asked, turning to me. I could see he was 
really worried. 

Maybe this is the camp, I joked. Mike didnt think that was funny. 

We were all confused as we pushed and shoved our way off the bus. Mike 
and I were the last ones off since we were sitting in the back. 

As I stepped onto the hard ground, I shielded my eyes against the bright 
sunlight high in the afternoon sky. We were in a flat, open area. The bus was 



parked beside a concrete platform, about the size of a tennis court. 

It must be some kind of bus station or something, I told Mike. You know. A 
drop-off point. 

He had his hands shoved into the pockets of his shorts. He kicked at the dirt 
but didnt say anything. 

On the other side of the platform, Jay was messing around with a boy I 
hadnt met yet. Colin was leaning against the side of the bus, being cool. The four 
girls were standing in a circle near the front of the platform, talking quietly about 
something. 

I watched the driver walk over to the side of the bus and pull open the 
luggage compartment. He began pulling out bags and camp trunks and carrying 
them to the concrete platform. 

A couple of guys had sat down on the edge of the platform to watch the 
driver work. Across the platform, Jay and the other guy started a contest, tossing 
little red pebbles as far as they could. 

Mike, his hands still buried in his pockets, stepped up behind the sweating 
bus driver. Hey, where are we? Why are we stopping here? Mike asked him 
nervously. 

The driver slid a heavy black trunk from the back of the luggage 
compartment. He completely ignored Mikes questions. Mike asked them again. 
And again the driver pretended Mike wasnt there. 

Mike made his way back to where I was standing, walking slowly, dragging 
his shoes across the hard ground. He looked really worried. 

I was confused, but I wasnt worried. I mean, the bus driver was calmly 
going about his business, unloading the bus. He knew what he was doing. 

Why wont he answer me? Why wont he tell us anything? Mike demanded. 

I felt bad that Mike was so nervous. But I didnt want to hear any more of 
his questions. He was starting to make me nervous, too. 

I wandered away from him, making my way along the side of the platform 
to where the four girls were standing. Across the platform, Jay and his buddies 
were still having their stone-throwing contest. 

Dawn smiled at me as I came closer. Then she glanced quickly away. Shes 
really pretty, I thought. Her blond hair gleamed in the bright sunlight. 

Are you from Center City? her friend Dori asked, squinting at me, her 
freckled face twisted against the sun. 

No, I told her. Im from Midlands. Its north of Center City. Near Outreach 



Bay. 

I know where Midlands is! Dori snapped snottily. The other three girls 
laughed. 

I could feel myself blushing. 

Whats your name? Dawn asked, staring at me with her green eyes. 

Billy, I told her. 

My birds name is Billy! she exclaimed, and the girls all laughed again. 

Where are you girls going? I asked quickly, eager to change the subject. I 
mean, what camp? 

Camp Nightmoon. Theres one for boys and one for girls, Dori answered. 
This is an all-Camp Nightmoon bus. 

Is your camp near ours? I asked. I didnt even know there was a Camp 
Nightmoon for girls. 

Dori shrugged. We dont know, Dawn replied. This is our first year. 

All of us, Dori added. 

Me, too, I told them. I wonder why we stopped here. 

The girls all shrugged. 

I saw that Mike was lingering behind me, looking even more scared. I 
turned and made my way back to him. 

Look. The driver is finished carrying out our stuff, he said, pointing. 

I turned in time to see the driver slam the luggage compartment door shut. 

Whats happening? Mike cried. Is someone picking us up here? Why did he 
unload all our stuff? 

Ill go find out, I said quietly. I started to jog over to the driver. He was 
standing in front of the open bus door, mopping his perspiring forehead with the 
short sleeve of his tan drivers uniform. 

He saw me comingand quickly climbed into the bus. He slid into the drivers 
seat, pulling a green sun visor down over his forehead as I stepped up to the 
door. 

Is someone coming for us? I called in to him. 

To my surprise, he pulled the lever, and the bus door slammed shut in my 

face. 

The engine started up with a roar and a burst of gray exhaust fumes. 

Hey! I screamed, and pounded angrily on the glass door. 

I had to leap back as the bus squealed away, its tires spinning noisily on the 
hard dirt. Hey! I shouted. You dont have to run me over! 



I stared angrily as the bus bounced onto the road and roared away. Then I 
turned back to Mike. He was standing beside the four girls. They were all 
looking upset now. 

Hehe left, Mike stammered as I approached them. He just left us here in the 
middle of nowhere. 

We gazed down the road at the bus until it disappeared over the darkening 
horizon. We all grew very quiet. 

A few seconds later, we heard the frightening animal cries. 

Very close. And getting closer. 



3 


Wh-whats that? Mike stammered. 

We turned in the direction of the shrill cries. 

They seemed to be coming from across the platform. At first, I thought that 
Jay and Colin and their friends were playing a joke on us, making the animal 
cries to frighten us. 

But then I saw the scared, wide-eyed expressions on their faces. Jay, Colin, 
and the others had frozen in place. They werent making the noises. 

The cries grew louder. Closer. 

Shrill warnings. 

And then, staring into the distance beyond the platform, I saw them. Small, 
dark creatures, keeping low, rolling rapidly along the flat ground, tossing their 
heads back and uttering excited shrieks as they came toward us. 

What are they? Mike cried, moving close to me. 

Are they prairie wolves? Dori asked in a trembling voice. 

I hope not! one of the other girls called out. 

We all climbed onto the concrete platform and huddled behind our trunks 
and bags. 

The animal cries grew louder as the creatures drew near. I could see dozens 
of them. They scurried toward us over the flat ground as if being blown by the 
wind. 

Help! Somebody help us! I heard Mike scream. 

Next to me, Jay still had two of the red pebbles from his stone-throwing 
competition in his hand. Pick up rocks! he was shouting frantically. Maybe we 
can scare them away! 

The creatures stopped a few yards from the concrete platform and raised 
themselves up menacingly on their hind feet. 

Huddled between Mike and Jay, I could see them clearly now. They were 
wolves or wildcats of some sort. Standing upright, they were nearly three feet 
tall. 

They had slender, almost scrawny bodies covered with spotty red-brown 
fur. Their paws had long silvery claws growing out of them. Their heads were 
nearly as slender as their bodies. Tiny red weasel eyes stared hungrily at us. 



Their long mouths snapped open and shut, revealing double rows of silvery, 
daggerlike teeth. 

No! No! Help! Mike dropped to his knees. His entire body convulsed in a 
shudder of terror. 

Some of the kids were crying. Others gaped at the advancing creatures in 
stunned silence. 

I was too scared to cry out or move or do anything. 

I stared at the row of creatures, my heart thudding, my mouth as dry as 
cotton. 

The creatures grew silent. Standing a few feet from the platform, they eyed 
us, snapping their jaws loudly, hungrily. White froth began to drip from their 
mouths. 

Theytheyre going to attack! a boy yelled. 

They look hungry! I heard one of the girls say. 

The white froth poured thickly over their pointed teeth. They continued to 
snap their jaws. It sounded like a dozen steel traps being snapped shut. 

Suddenly, one of them leaped onto the edge of the platform. 

No! several kids cried out in unison. 

We huddled closer together, trying to stay behind the pile of trunks and 

bags. 

Another creature climbed onto the platform. Then three more. 

I took a step back. 

I saw Jay pull back his arm and heave a red rock at one of the frothing 
creatures. The rock hit the platform with a crack and bounced away. 

The creatures were not frightened. They arched their backs, preparing to 
attack. 

They began to make a high-pitched chattering sound. 

And moved nearer. Nearer. 

Jay threw another rock. 

This one hit one of the advancing creatures on the side. It uttered a shrill 
eek of surprise. But it kept moving steadily forward, its red eyes trained on Jay, 
its jaws snapping hungrily. 

Go away! Dori cried in a trembling voice. Go home! Go away! Go away! 

But her shouts had no effect. 

The creatures advanced. 

Run! I urged. Run! 



We cant outrun them! someone shouted. 

The shrill chittering grew louder. Deafening. Until it seemed as if we were 
surrounded by a wall of sound. 

The ugly creatures lowered themselves to pounce. 

Run! I repeated. Come onrun! 

My legs wouldnt cooperate. They felt rubbery and weak. 

Trying to back away from the attacking creatures, I toppled over backward 
off the platform. 

I saw flashing stars as the back of my head hit the hard ground. 

Theyre going to get me, I realized. 

I cant get away.

I heard the sirenlike attack cry. 

I heard the scrape of the creatures long claws over the concrete platform. 

I heard the screams and cries of the frightened campers. 

Then, as I struggled frantically to pull myself up, I heard the deafening roar. 

At first I thought it was an explosion. 

I thought the platform had blown up. 

But then I turned and saw the rifle. 

Another explosion of gunfire. White smoke filled the air. 

The creatures spun around and darted away, silent now, their scraggly fur 
scraping the ground as they kept low, their tails between their furry legs. 

Ha-ha! Look at em run! A man kept a rifle poised on his shoulder as he 
watched the creatures retreat. 

Behind him stood a long green bus. 

I pulled myself up and brushed myself off. 

Everyone was laughing now, jumping up and down joyfully, celebrating the 
narrow escape. 

I was still too shaken up to celebrate. 

Theyre running like jackrabbits! the man declared in a booming voice. He 
lowered the rifle. 

It took me a while to realize he had come out of the camp bus to rescue us. 
We hadnt heard or seen the bus pull up because of the attack cries of the animals. 

Are you okay, Mike? I asked, walking over to my frightened-looking new 
friend. 

I guess, he replied uncertainly. I guess Im okay now. 

Dawn slapped me on the back, grinning. Were okay! she cried. Were all 
okay! 

We gathered in front of the man with the rifle. 

He was big and red-faced, mostly bald except for a fringe of curly yellow 
hair around his head. He had a blond mustache under an enormous beak of a 
nose and tiny black bird eyes beneath bushy blond eyebrows. 

Hi, guys! Im Uncle Al. Im your friendly camp director. I hope you enjoyed 



that welcome to Camp Nightmoon! he boomed in a deep voice. 

I heard muttered replies. 

He leaned the rifle against the bus and took a few steps toward us, studying 
our faces. He was wearing white shorts and a bright green camp T-shirt that 
stretched over his big belly. Two young guys, also in green and white, stepped 
out of the bus, serious expressions on their faces. 

Lets load up, Uncle A1 instructed them in his deep voice. 

He didnt apologize for being late. 

He didnt explain about the weird animals. And he didnt ask if we were okay 
after that scare. 

The two counselors began dragging the camp trunks and shoving them into 
the luggage compartment on the bus. 

Looks like a good group this year, Uncle A1 shouted. Well drop you girls 
off first across the river. Then well get you boys settled in. 

What were those awful animals? Dori called to Uncle Al. 

He didnt seem to hear her. 

We began climbing onto the bus. I looked for Mike and found him near the 
end of the line. His face was pale, and he still looked really shaken. II was really 
scared, he admitted. 

But were okay, I reassured him. Now we can relax and have fun. 

Im so hungry, Mike complained. I havent eaten all day. 

One of the counselors overheard him. You wont be hungry when you taste 
the camp food, he told Mike. 

We piled into the bus. I sat next to Mike. I could hear the poor guys 
stomach growling. I suddenly realized I was starving, too. And I was really eager 
to see what Camp Nightmoon looked like. I hoped it wouldnt be a long bus ride 
to get there. 

How far away is our camp? I called to Uncle Al, who had slid into the 
drivers seat. 

He didnt seem to hear me. 

Hey, Mike, were on our way! I said happily as the bus pulled onto the road. 

Mike forced a smile. Im so glad to get away from there! 

To my surprise, the bus ride took less than five minutes. 

We all muttered our shock at what a short trip it was. Why hadnt the first 
bus taken us all the way? 

A big wooden sign proclaiming camp nightmoon came into view, and Uncle 



A1 turned the bus onto a gravel road that led through a patch of short trees into 
the camp. 

We followed the narrow, winding road across a green river. Several small 
cabins came into view. Girls camp, Uncle A1 announced. The bus stopped to let 
the four girls off. Dawn waved to me as she climbed down. 

A few minutes later, we pulled into the boys camp. Through the bus 
window I could see a row of small white cabins. On top of a gently sloping hill 
stood a large white-shingled building, probably a meeting lodge or mess hall. 

At the edge of a field, three counselors, all dressed in white shorts and 
green T-shirts, were working to start a fire in a large stone barbecue pit. 

Hey, were going to have a cookout! I exclaimed to Mike. I was starting to 
feel really excited. 

Mike smiled, too. He was practically drooling at the thought of food! 

The bus came to an abrupt stop at the end of the row of small bunks. Uncle 
A1 pulled himself up quickly from the drivers seat and turned to us. Welcome to 
beautiful Camp Nightmoon! he bellowed. Step down and line up for your bunk 
assignments. Once you get unpacked and have dinner, Ill see you at the 
campfire. 

We pushed our way noisily out of the bus. I saw Jay enthusiastically 
slapping another boy on the back. I think we were all feeling a lot better, 
forgetting about our close call. 

I stepped down and took a deep breath. The cool air smelled really sweet 
and fresh. I saw a long row of short evergreen trees behind the white lodge on 
the hill. 

As I took my place in line, I searched for the waterfront. I could hear the 
soft rush of the river behind a thick row of evergreens, but I couldnt see it. 

Mike, Jay, Colin, and I were assigned to the same bunk. It was Bunk 4. I 
thought the bunk should have a more interesting name. But it just had a number. 
Bunk 4. 

It was really small, with a low ceiling and windows on two sides. It was just 
big enough for six campers. There were bunk beds against three walls and a tall 
dresser on the fourth wall, with a little square of space in the middle. 

There was no bathroom. I guessed it was in another building. 

As the four of us entered the bunk, we saw that one of the beds had already 
been claimed. It had been carefully made, the green blanket tucked in neatly, 
some sports magazines and a radio resting on top. 



That must belong to our counselor, Jay said, inspecting the radio. 

Hope we dont have to wear those ugly green T-shirts, Colin said, grinning. 
He was still wearing his silver sunglasses, even though the sun was nearly down 
and it was just about as dark as night in the cabin. 

Jay claimed a top bunk, and Colin took the bed beneath his. 

Can I have a lower one? Mike asked me. I roll around a lot at night. Im 
afraid I might fall out of a top one. 

Yeah. Sure. No problem, I replied. I wanted the top bunk anyway. It would 
be a lot more fun. 

Hope you guys dont snore, Colin said. 

Were not going to sleep in here anyway, Jay said. Were going to party all 
night! He playfully slapped Mike on the back, so hard that Mike went sprawling 
into the dresser. 

Hey! Mike whined. That hurt! 

Sorry. Guess I dont know my own strength, Jay replied, grinning at Colin. 

The cabin door opened, and a redheaded guy with dark freckles all over his 
face walked in, carrying a big gray plastic bag. He was tall and very skinny and 
was wearing white shorts and a green camp T-shirt. 

Hey, guys, he said, and dropped the large bag on the cabin floor with a 
groan. He checked us out, then pointed to the bag. Theres your bed stuff, he said. 
Make your beds. Try to make them as neat as mine. He pointed to the bunk 
against the window with the radio on it. 

Are you our counselor? I asked. 

He nodded. Yeah. Im the lucky one. He turned and started to walk out. 

Whats your name? Jay called after him. 

Larry, he said, pushing open the cabin door. Your trunks will be here in a 
few minutes, he told us. You can fight it out over drawer space. Two of the 
drawers are stuck shut. 

He started out the door, then turned back to us. Keep away from my stuff. 
The door slammed hard behind him. 

Peering out the window, I watched him lope away, taking long, fast strides, 
bobbing his head as he walked. 

Great guy, Colin muttered sarcastically. 

Real friendly, Jay added, shaking his head. 

Then we dived into the plastic bag and pulled out sheets and wool blankets. 
Jay and Colin got into a wrestling match over a blanket they claimed was softer 



than the others. 

I tossed a sheet onto my mattress and started to climb up to tuck it in. 
I was halfway up the ladder when I heard Mike scream. 



5 


Mike was right beneath me, making his bed. He screamed so loud, I cried out 
and nearly fell off the ladder. 

I leaped off the ladder, my heart pounding, and stepped beside him. 

Staring straight ahead, his mouth wide open in horror, Mike backed away 
from his bed. 

Mikewhats wrong? I asked. What is it? 

S-snakes! Mike stammered, staring straight ahead at his unmade bed as he 
backed away. 

Huh? I followed his gaze. It was too dark to see anything. 

Colin laughed. Not that old joke! he cried. 

Larry put rubber snakes in your bed, Jay said, grinning as he stepped up 
beside us. 

Theyre not rubber! Theyre real! Mike insisted, his voice trembling. 

Jay laughed and shook his head. I cant believe you fell for that old gag. He 
took a few steps toward the bedthen stopped. Hey! 

I moved close, and the two snakes came into focus. Raising themselves 
from the shadows, they arched their heads, pulling back as if preparing to attack. 

Theyre real! Jay cried, turning back to Colin. Two of them! 

Probably not poisonous, Colin said, venturing closer. 

The two let out angry hisses, raising themselves high off the bed. They were 
very long and skinny. Their heads were wider than their bodies. Their tongues 
flicked from side to side as they arched themselves menacingly. 

Im scared of snakes, Mike uttered in a soft voice. 

Theyre probably scared of youl Jay joked, slapping Mike on the back. 

Mike winced. He was in no mood for Jays horseplay. Weve got to get Larry 
or somebody, Mike said. 

No way! Jay insisted. You can handle em, Mike. Theres only two of them! 

Jay gave Mike a playful shove toward the bed. He only meant to give him a 
scare. 

But Mike stumbledand fell onto the bed. 

The snakes darted in unison. 



I saw one of them clamp its teeth into Mikes hand. 

Mike raised himself to his feet. He didnt react at first. Then he uttered a 
high-pitched shriek. 

Two drops of blood appeared on the back of his right hand. He stared down 
at them, then grabbed the hand. 

It bit me! he shrieked. 

Oh, no! I cried. 

Did it puncture the skin? Colin asked. Is it bleeding? 

Jay rushed forward and grabbed Mikes shoulder. Hey, manlm really sorry, 
he said. I didnt mean to 

Mike groaned in pain. Itreally hurts, he whispered. He was breathing really 
hard, his chest heaving, making weird noises as he breathed. 

The snakes, coiled in the middle of his lower bunk, began to hiss again. 

Youd better hurry to the nurse, Jay said, his hand still on Mikes shoulder. Ill 
come with you. 

N-no, Mike stammered. His face was as pale as a ghosts. He held his hand 
tightly. Ill go find her! He burst out of the cabin, running at full speed. The door 
slammed behind him. 

Heyl didnt mean to push him, you know, Jay explained to us. I could see he 
was really upset. I was just joking, just trying to scare him a little. I didnt mean 
for him to fall or anything. His voice trailed off. 

What are we going to do about them ? I asked, pointing at the two coiled 
snakes. 

Ill get Larry, Colin offered. He started toward the door. 

No, wait. I called him back. Look. Theyve moved onto Mikes sheet, right? 

Jay and Colin followed my gaze to the bed. The snakes arched themselves 
high, preparing to bite again. 

So? Jay asked, scratching his disheveled hair. 

So we can wrap them up in the sheet and carry them outside, I said. 

Jay stared at me. Wish Id thought of that. Lets do it, man! 

Youll get bit, Colin warned. 

I stared at the snakes. They seemed to be studying me, too. They cant bite 
us through the sheet, I said. 

They can try! Colin exclaimed, hanging back. 

If were fast enough, I said, taking a cautious step toward the bed, we can 
wrap them up before they know whats happening. 



The snakes hissed out a warning, drawing themselves higher. 

How did they get in here, anyway? Colin asked. 

Maybe the camp is crawling with snakes, Jay said, grinning. Maybe youve 
got some in your bed, too, Colin! He laughed. 

Lets get serious here, I said sternly, my eyes locked on the coiled snakes. 
Are we going to try this or not? 

Yeah. Lets do it, Jay answered. I mean, I owe it to Mike. 

Colin remained silent. 

Ill bet I could grab one by the tail and swing him out through the window, 
Jay said. You could grab the tail end of the other one and 

Lets try my plan first, I suggested quietly. 

We crept over to the snakes, sneaking up on them. It was kind of silly since 
they were staring right at us. 

I pointed to one end of the sheet, which was folded up onto the bed. Grab it 
there, I instructed Jay. Then pull it up. 

He hesitated. What if I miss? Or you miss? 

Then were in trouble, I replied grimly. My eyes on the snakes, I reached my 
hand forward to the other corner of the sheet. Ready? On three, I whispered. 

My heart was in my mouth. I could barely choke out, One, two, three. 

At the count of three, we both grabbed for the ends of the sheet. 

Pull! I cried in a shrill voice I couldnt believe was coming from me. 

We pulled up the sheet and brought the ends together, making a bundle. 

At the bottom of the bundle, the snakes wriggled frantically. I heard their 
jaws snap. They wriggled so hard, the bottom of the bundle swung back and 
forth. 

They dont like this, Jay said as we hurried to the door, carrying our 
wriggling, swaying bundle between us, trying to keep our bodies as far away 
from it as possible. 

I pushed open the door with my shoulder, and we ran out onto the grass. 

Now what? Jay asked. 

Keep going, I replied. I could see one of the snakes poking its head out. 
Hurry! 

We ran past the cabins toward a small clump of shrubs. Beyond the shrubs 
stood a patch of low trees. When we reached the trees, we swung the bundle 
back, then heaved the whole sheet into the trees. 

It opened as it fell to the ground. The two snakes slithered out instantly and 



pulled themselves to shelter under the trees. 

Jay and I let out loud sighs of relief. We stood there for a moment, hunched 
over, hands on our knees, trying to catch our breath. 

Crouching down, I looked for the snakes. But they had slithered deep into 
the safety of the evergreens. 

I stood up. I guess we should take back Mikes sheet, I said. 

He probably wont want to sleep on it, Jay said. But he reached down and 
pulled it up from the grass. He balled it up and tossed it to me. Its probably 
dripping with snake venom, he said, making a disgusted face. 

When we got back to the cabin, Colin had made his bed and was busily 
unpacking the contents of his trunk, shoving everything into the top dresser 
drawer. He turned as we entered. Howd it go? he asked casually. 

Horrible, Jay replied quickly, his expression grim. We both got bit. Twice. 

Youre a terrible liar! Colin told him, laughing. You shouldnt even try. 

Jay laughed, too. 

Colin turned to me. Youre a hero, he said. 

Thanks for all your help, Jay told him sarcastically. 

Colin started to reply. But the cabin door opened, and Larry poked his 
freckled face in. Hows it going? he asked. Youre not finished yet? 

We had a little problem, Jay told him. 

Wheres the fourth guy? The chubby one? Larry asked, lowering his head so 
he wouldnt bump it on the door frame as he stepped inside. 

Mike got bit. By a snake, I told him. 

There were two snakes in his bed, Jay added. 

Larrys expression didnt change. He didnt seem at all surprised. So where 
did Mike go? he asked casually, swatting a mosquito on his arm. 

His hand was bleeding. He went to the nurse to get it taken care of, I told 

him. 

Huh? Larrys mouth dropped open. 

He went to find the nurse, I repeated. 

Larry tossed back his head and started to laugh. Nurse? he cried, laughing 
hard. What nurse?! 



6 


The door opened and Mike returned, still holding his wounded hand. His face 
was pale, his expression frightened. They said there was no nurse, he told me. 

Then he saw Larry sitting on his bunk. Larrymy hand, Mike said. He held 
the hand out so the counselor could see it. It was stained with bright red blood. 

Larry stood up. I think I have some bandages, he told Mike. He pulled out a 
slender black case from beneath his bunk and began to search through it. 

Mike stood beside him, holding up his hand. Drops of blood splashed on 
the cabin floor. They said the camp doesnt have a nurse, Mike repeated. 

Larry shook his head. If you get hurt in this camp, he told Mike seriously, 
youre on your own. 

I think my hand is swelling a little, Mike said. 

Larry handed him a roll of bandages. The washroom is at the end of this 
row of cabins, he told Mike, closing the case and shoving it back under the bed. 
Go wash the hand and bandage it. Hurry. Its almost dinnertime. 

Holding the bandages tightly in his good hand, Mike hurried off to follow 
Larrys instructions. 

By the way, howd you guys get the snakes out of here? Larry asked, 
glancing around the cabin. 

We carried them out in Mikes sheet, Jay told him. He pointed at me. It was 
Billys idea. 

Larry stared hard at me. Hey, Im impressed, Billy, he said. That was pretty 
brave, man. 

Maybe I inherited something from my parents, I told him. Theyre scientists. 
Explorers, kind of. They go off for months at a time, exploring the wildest 
places. 

Well, Camp Nightmoon is pretty wild, Larry said. And you guys had better 
be careful. Im warning you. His expression turned serious. Theres no nurse at 
Camp Nightmoon. Uncle A1 doesnt believe in coddling you guys. 

The hot dogs were all charred black, but we were so hungry, we didnt care. I 
shoved three of them down in less than five minutes. I dont think Id ever been so 
hungry in all my life. 



The campfire was in a flat clearing surrounded by a circle of round white 
stones. Behind us, the large white-shingled lodge loomed over the sloping hill. 
Ahead of us a thick line of evergreen trees formed a fence that hid the river from 
view. 

Through a small gap in the trees, I could see a flickering campfire in the 
distance on the other side of the river. I wondered if that was the campfire of the 
girls camp. 

I thought about Dawn and Dori. I wondered if the two camps ever got 
together, if Id ever see them again. 

Dinner around the big campfire seemed to put everyone in a good mood. 
Jay was the only one sitting near me who complained about the hot dogs being 
burned. But I think he put away four or five of them anyway! 

Mike had trouble eating because of his bandaged hand. When he dropped 
his first hot dog, I thought he was going to burst into tears. By the end of dinner, 
he was in a much better mood. His wounded hand had swelled up just a little. 
But he said it didnt hurt as much as before. 

The counselors were easy to spot. They all wore their identical white shorts 
and green T-shirts. There were eight or ten of them, all young guys probably 
sixteen or seventeen. They ate together quietly, away from us campers. I kept 
looking at Larry, but he never once turned around to look at any of us. 

I was thinking about Larry, trying to figure out if he was shy or if he just 
didnt like us campers very much. Suddenly, Uncle A1 climbed to his feet and 
motioned with both hands for us all to be quiet. 

I want to welcome you boys to Camp Nightmoon, he began. I hope youre 
all unpacked and comfortable in your bunks. I know that most of you are first¬ 
time campers. 

He was speaking quickly, without any pauses between sentences, as if he 
was running through this for the thousandth time and wanted to get it over with. 

Id like to tell you some of our basic rules, he continued. First, lights-out is 
at nine sharp. 

A lot of guys groaned. 

You might think you can ignore this rule, Uncle A1 continued, paying no 
attention to their reaction. You might think you can sneak out of your cabins to 
meet or take a walk by the river. But Im warning you now that we dont allow it, 
and we have very good ways of making sure this rule is obeyed. 

He paused to clear his throat. 



Some boys were giggling about something. Across from me, Jay burped 
loudly, which caused more giggles. 

Uncle A1 didnt seem to hear any of this. On the other side of the river is the 
girls camp, he continued loudly, motioning to the trees. You might be able to see 
their campfire. Well, I want to make it clear that swimming or rowing over to the 
girls camp is strictly forbidden. 

Several boys groaned loudly. This made everyone laugh. Even some of the 
counselors laughed. Uncle A1 remained grim-faced. 

The woods around Camp Nightmoon are filled with grizzlies and tree bears, 
Uncle A1 continued. They come to the river to bathe and to drink. And theyre 
usually hungry. 

This caused another big reaction from all of us sitting around the fading 
campfire. Someone made a loud growling sound. Another kid screamed. Then 
everyone laughed. 

You wont be laughing if a bear claws your head off, Uncle A1 said sternly. 

He turned to the group of counselors outside our circle. Larry, Kurt, come 
over here, he ordered. 

The two counselors climbed obediently to their feet and made their way to 
the center of the circle beside Uncle Al. 

I want you two to demonstrate to the new campers the procedure to follow 
whener, I mean, z’/you are attacked by a grizzly bear. 

Immediately, the two counselors dropped to the ground on their stomachs. 
They lay flat and covered the backs of their heads with their hands. 

Thats right. I hope youre all paying close attention, the camp director 
thundered at us. 

Cover your neck and head. Try your best not to move. He motioned to the 
two counselors. Thanks, guys. You can get up. 

Have there ever been any bear attacks here? I called out, cupping my hands 
so Uncle Al could hear me. 

He turned in my direction. Two last summer, he replied. 

Several boys gasped. 

It wasnt pretty, Uncle Al continued. Its hard to remain still when a huge 
bear is pawing you and drooling all over you. But if you move His voice trailed 
off, leaving the rest to our imaginations, I guess. 

I felt a cold shiver run down my back. I didnt want to think about bears and 
bear attacks. 



What kind of camp did Mom and Dad send me to? I found myself 
wondering. I couldnt wait to call them and tell them about all that had happened 
already. 

Uncle A1 waited for everyone to quiet down, then pointed off to the side. 
Do you see that cabin over there? he asked. 

In the dim evening light, I could make out a cabin standing halfway up the 
hill toward the lodge. It appeared to be a little larger than the other cabins. It 
seemed to be built on a slant, sort of tipping on its side, as if the wind had tried 
to blow it over. 

I want you to make sure you see that cabin, Uncle A1 warned, his voice 
thundering out above the crackling of the purple fire. That is known as the 
Forbidden Bunk. We dont talk about that bunkand we dont go near it. 

I felt another cold shiver as I stared through the gray evening light at the 
shadowy, tilted cabin. I felt a sharp sting on the back of my neck and slapped a 
mosquito, too late to keep it from biting me. 

Im going to repeat what I just said, Uncle A1 shouted, still pointing to the 
dark cabin on the hill. That is known as the Forbidden Bunk. It has been closed 
and boarded up for many years. No one is to go near that cabin. No one. 

This started everyone talking and laughing. Nervous laughter, I think. 

Why is the Forbidden Bunk forbidden? someone called out. 

We never talk about it, Uncle A1 replied sharply. 

Jay leaned over and whispered in my ear, Lets go check it out. 

I laughed. Then I turned back to Jay uncertainly. Youre kiddingright? 

He grinned in reply and didnt say anything. 

I turned back toward the fire. Uncle A1 was wishing us all a good stay and 
saying how much he was looking forward to camp this year. And one more rule, 
he called out. You must write to your parents every day. Every day! We want 
them to know what a great time youre having at Camp Nightmoon. 

I saw Mike holding his wounded hand gingerly. Its starting to throb, he told 
me, sounding very frightened. 

Maybe Larry has something to put on it, I said. Lets go ask him. 

Uncle A1 dismissed us. We all climbed to our feet, stretching and yawning, 
and started to make our way in small groups back to the bunks. 

Mike and I lingered behind, hoping to talk to Larry. We saw him talking to 
the other counselors. He was at least a head taller than all of them. 

Hey, Larry! Mike called. 



But by the time we pushed our way through the groups of kids heading the 
other way, Larry had disappeared. 

Maybe hes going to our bunk to make sure we obey lights-out, I suggested. 

Lets go see, Mike replied anxiously. 

We walked quickly past the dying campfire. It had stopped crackling but 
still glowed a deep purple-red. Then we headed along the curve of the hill 
toward Bunk 4. 

My hand really hurts, Mike groaned, holding it tenderly in front of him. Im 
not just complaining. Its throbbing and its swelling up. And Im starting to have 
chills. 

Larry will know what to do, I replied, trying to sound reassuring. 

I hope so, Mike said shakily. 

We both stopped when we heard the howls. 

Hideous howls. Like an animal in pain. But too human to be from an 
animal. 

Long, shrill howls that cut through the air and echoed down the hill. 

Mike uttered a quiet gasp. He turned to me. Even in the darkness, I could 
see the fright on his face. 

Those cries, he whispered. Theyre coming from the Forbidden Bunk!

A few minutes later, Mike and I trudged into the cabin. Jay and Colin were 
sitting tensely on their beds. Wheres Larry? Mike asked, fear creeping into his 
voice. 

Not here, Colin replied. 

Where is he? Mike demanded shrilly. Ive got to find him. My hand! 

He should be here soon, Jay offered. 

I could still hear the strange howls through the open window. Do you hear 
that? I asked, walking over to the window and listening hard. 

Probably a prairie cat, Colin said. 

Prairie cats dont howl, Mike told him. Prairie cats screech, but they dont 
howl. 

How do you know? Colin asked, walking over to Larrys bunk and sitting 
down on the bottom bed. 

We studied them in school, Mike replied. 

Another howl made us all stop and listen. 

It sounds like a man, Jay offered, his eyes lighting up excitedly. A man 
whos been locked up in the Forbidden Bunk for years and years. 

Mike swallowed hard. Do you really think so? 

Jay and Colin laughed. 

What should I do about my hand? Mike asked, holding it up. It was 
definitely swollen. 

Go wash it again, I told him. And put a fresh bandage on it. I peered out the 
window into the darkness. Maybe Larry will show up soon. He probably knows 
where to get something to put on it. 

I cant believe theres no nurse, Mike whined. Why would my parents send 
me to a camp where theres no nurse or infirmary or anything? 

Uncle A1 doesnt like to coddle us, Colin said, repeating Larrys words. 

Jay stood up and broke into an imitation of Uncle Al. Stay away from the 
Forbidden Bunk! he cried in a booming deep voice. He sounded a lot like him. 
We dont talk about it and we dont ever go near it! 

We all laughed at Jays impression. Even Mike. 

We should go there tonight! Colin said enthusiastically. We should check it 



out immediately! 

We heard another long, sorrowful howl roll down the hill from the direction 
of the Forbidden Bunk. 

II dont think we should, Mike said softly, examining his hand. He started 
for the door. Im going to go wash this. The door slammed behind him. 

Hes scared, Jay scoffed. 

Im a little scared, too, I admitted. I mean, those awful howls 

Jay and Colin both laughed. Every camp has something like the Forbidden 
Bunk. The camp director makes it up, Colin said. 

Yeah, Jay agreed. Camp directors love scaring kids. Its the only fun they 
have. 

He puffed out his chest and imitated Uncle A1 again: Dont leave the bunk 
after lights-out or youll never be seen again! he thundered, then burst out 
laughing. 

Theres nothing in that Forbidden Bunk, Colin said, shaking his head. Its 
probably completely empty. Its all just a joke. You know. Like camp ghost 
stories. Every camp has its own ghost story. 

How do you know? I asked, dropping down onto Mikes bed. Have you ever 
been to camp before? 

No, Colin replied. But I have friends who told me about their camp. He 
reached up and pulled off his silver sunglasses for the first time. He had bright 
sky-blue eyes, like big blue marbles. 

We suddenly heard a bugle repeating a slow, sad-sounding tune. 

That must be the signal for lights-out, I said, yawning. I started to pull off 
my shoes. I was too tired to change or wash up. I planned to sleep in my clothes. 

Lets sneak out and explore the Forbidden Bunk, Jay urged. Come on. We 
can be the first ones to do it! 

I yawned again. Im really too tired, I told them. 

Me, too, Colin said. He turned to Jay. How about tomorrow night? 

Jays face fell in disappointment. 

Tomorrow, Colin insisted, kicking his shoes into the corner and starting to 
pull off his socks. 

I wouldnt do it if I were you! 

The voice startled all three of us. We turned to the window where Larrys 
head suddenly appeared from out of the darkness. He grinned in at us. Id listen 
to Uncle A1 if I were you, he said. 



How long had he been out there listening to us? I wondered. Was he 
deliberately spying on us? 

The door opened. Larry lowered his head as he loped in. His grin had faded. 
Unde A1 wasnt kidding around, he said seriously. 

Yeah. Sure, Colin replied sarcastically. He went over to his bed and slid 
beneath the wool blanket. 

I guess the camp ghost will get us if we go out after lights-out, Jay joked, 
tossing a towel across the room. 

No. No ghost, Larry said softly. But Sabre will. He pulled out his drawer 
and began searching for something inside it. 

Huh? Whos Sabre? I asked, suddenly wide-awake. 

Sabre is an it, Larry answered mysteriously. 

Sabre is a red-eyed monster who eats a camper every night, Colin sneered. 
He stared at me. There is no Sabre. Larrys just giving us another phony camp 
story. 

Larry stopped searching his drawer and gazed up at Colin. No, Im not, he 
insisted in a low voice. Im trying to save you guys some trouble. Im not trying to 
scare you. 

Then what is Sabre? I asked impatiently. 

Larry pulled a sweater from the drawer, then pushed the drawer shut. You 
dont want to find out, he replied. 

Come on. Tell us what it is, I begged. 

He isnt going to, Colin said. 

Ill tell you guys only one thing. Sabre will rip your heart out, Larry said 
flatly. 

Jay snickered. Yeah. Sure. 

Im serious! Larry snapped. Im not kidding, you guys! He pulled the sweater 
over his head. You dont believe me? Go out one night. Go out and meet Sabre. 
He struggled to get his arm into the sweater sleeve. But before you do, he 
warned, leave me a note with your address so Ill know where to send your stuff.

We had fun the next morning. 

We all woke up really early. The sun was just rising over the horizon to the 
south, and the air was still cool and damp. I could hear birds chirping. 

The sound reminded me of home. As I lowered myself to the floor and 
stretched, I thought of my mom and dad and wished I could call them and tell 
them about the camp. But it was only the second day. Id be too embarrassed to 
call them on the second day. 

I was definitely homesick. But luckily there wasnt any time to feel sad. 
After we pulled on fresh clothes, we hurried up to the lodge on the hill, which 
served as a meeting hall, theater, and mess hall. 

Long tables and benches were set up in straight rows in the center of the 
enormous room. The floorboards and walls were all dark redwood. Redwood 
ceiling beams crisscrossed high above our heads. There were very few windows, 
so it felt as if we were in an enormous dark cave. 

The clatter of dishes and cups and silverware was deafening. Our shouts 
and laughter rang off the high ceiling, echoed off the hardwood walls. Mike 
shouted something to me from across the table, but I couldnt hear him because 
of the racket. 

Some guys complained about the food, but I thought it was okay. We had 
scrambled egg squares, bacon strips, fried potatoes, and toast, with tall cups of 
juice. I never eat a breakfast that big at home. But I found that I was really 
starved, and I gobbled it up. 

After breakfast we lined up outside the lodge to form different activity 
groups. The sun had climbed high in the sky. It was going to be really hot. Our 
excited voices echoed off the sloping hill. We were all laughing and talking, 
feeling good. 

Larry and two other counselors, clipboards in hand, stood in front of us, 
shielding their eyes from the bright sun as they divided us into groups. The first 
group of about ten boys headed off to the river for a morning swim. 

Some people have all the luck, I thought. I was eager to get to the 
waterfront and see what the river was like. 

As I waited for my name to be called, I spotted a pay phone on the wall of 



the lodge. My parents flashed into my mind again. Maybe I will call them later, I 
decided. I was so eager to describe the camp to them and tell them about my new 
friends. 

Okay, guys. Follow me to the ball field, Larry instructed us. Were going to 
play our first game of scratchball. 

About twelve of us, including everyone from my bunk, followed Larry 
down the hill toward the flat grassy area that formed the playing field. 

I jogged to catch up to Larry, who always seemed to walk at top speed, 
stretching out his long legs as if he were in a terrible hurry. Are we going to 
swim after this? I asked. 

Without slowing his pace, he glanced at his clipboard. Yeah. I guess, he 
replied. You guysll need a swim. Were going to work up a sweat. 

You ever play scratchball before? Jay asked me as we hurried to keep up 
with Larry. 

Yeah. Sure, I replied. We play it a lot in school. 

Scratchball is an easy game to learn. The batter throws the ball in the air as 
high and as far as he can. Then he has to run the bases before someone on the 
other team catches the ball, tags him with it, or throws him out. 

Larry stopped at the far corner of the wide green field, where the bases and 
batters square had already been set up. He made us line up and divided us into 
two teams. 

He started calling out names. But when he called out Mikes name, Mike 
stepped up to Larry, holding his bandaged hand tenderly. II dont think I can play, 
Larry, Mike stammered. 

Come on, Mike. Dont whine, Larry snapped. 

But it really hurts, Mike insisted. Its throbbing like crazy, Larry. The pain is 
shooting all the way up and down my side. And lookhe raised the hand to Larrys 
faceits all swelled up! 

Larry pushed the arm away gently with his clipboard. Go sit in the shade, 
he told Mike. 

Shouldnt I get some medicine or something to put on it? Mike asked shrilly. 
I could see the poor guy was really in bad shape. 

Just sit over there, Larry ordered, pointing to a clump of short leafy trees at 
the edge of the field. Well talk about it later. 

Larry turned away from Mike and blew a whistle to start the game. Ill take 
Mikes place on the Blue team, he announced, jogging onto the field. 



I forgot about Mike as soon as the game got underway. We were having a 
lot of fun. Most of the guys were pretty good scratchball players, and we played 
much faster than my friends do back home at the playground. 

My first time up at the batters square, I heaved the ball really high. But it 
dropped right into a fielders hands, and I was out. My second time up, I made it 
to three bases before I was tagged out. 

Larry was a great player. When he came up to the batters square, he tossed 
the ball harder than I ever saw anyone toss it. It sailed over the fielders heads 
and, as they chased after it, Larry rounded all the bases, his long legs stretching 
out gracefully as he ran. 

By the fourth inning, our team, the Blue team, was ahead twelve to six. We 
had all played hard and were really hot and sweaty. I was looking forward to that 
swim at the waterfront. 

Colin was on the Red team. I noticed that he was the only player who wasnt 
enjoying the game. He had been tagged out twice, and hed missed an easy catch 
in the field. 

I realized that Colin wasnt very athletic. He had long, skinny arms without 
any muscles, and he also ran awkwardly. 

In the third inning Colin got into an argument with a player on my team 
about whether a toss had been foul or not. A few minutes later, Colin argued 
angrily with Larry about a ball that he claimed should have been out. 

He and Larry shouted at each other for a few minutes. It was no big deal, a 
typical sports argument. Larry finally ordered Colin to shut up and get back to 
the outfield. Colin grudgingly obeyed, and the game continued. 

I didnt think about it again. I mean, that kind of arguing happens all the 
time in ball games. And there are guys who enjoy the arguments as much as the 
game. 

But then, in the next inning, something strange happened that gave me a 
really bad feeling and made me stop and wonder just what was going on. 

Colins team came to bat. Colin stepped up to the batters square and 
prepared to toss the ball. 

Larry was playing the outfield. I was standing nearby, also in the field. 

Colin tossed the ball high but not very far. 

Larry and I both came running in to get it. 

Larry got there first. He picked up the small hard ball on the first bounce, 
drew back his armand then I saw his expression change. 



I saw his features tighten in anger. I saw his eyes narrow, his copper-colored 
eyebrows lower in concentration. 

With a loud grunt of effort, Larry heaved the ball as hard as he could. 

It struck Colin in the back of the head, making a loud crack sound as it hit. 

Colins silver sunglasses went flying in the air. 

Colin stopped short and uttered a short, high-pitched cry. His arms flew up 
as if hed been shot. Then his knees buckled. 

He collapsed in a heap, facedown on the grass. He didnt move. 

The ball rolled away over the grass. 

I cried out in shock. 

Then I saw Larrys expression change again. His eyes opened wide in 
disbelief. His mouth dropped open in horror. 

No! he cried. It slipped! I didnt mean to throw it at him! 

I knew Larry was lying. I had seen the anger on his face before he threw the 

ball. 

I sank down to my knees on the ground as Larry went running toward 
Colin. I felt dizzy and upset and confused. I had this sick feeling in my stomach. 

The ball slipped! Larry was yelling. It just slipped. 

Liar, I thought. Liar. Liar. Liar. 

I forced myself up on my feet and hurried to join the circle of guys around 
Colin. When I got there, Larry was kneeling over Colin, raising Colins head off 
the ground gently with both hands. 

Colins eyes were open wide. He stared up at Larry groggily and uttered low 
moans. 

Give him room, Larry was shouting. Give him room. He gazed down at 
Colin. The ball slipped. Im real sorry. The ball slipped. 

Colin moaned. His eyes rolled around in his head. Larry pulled off Colins 
red bandanna and mopped Colins forehead with it. 

Colin moaned again. His eyes closed. 

Help me carry him to the lodge, Larry instructed two guys from the Red 
team. The rest of you guys, get changed for your swim. The waterfront counselor 
will be waiting for you. 

I watched as Larry and the two guys hoisted Colin up and started to carry 
him toward the lodge. Larry gripped him under the shoulders. The two boys 
awkwardly took hold of his legs. 

The sick feeling in my stomach hadnt gone away. I kept picturing the 



intense expression of anger on Larrys face as he heaved the ball at the back of 
Colins head. 

I knew it had been deliberate. 

I started to follow them. I dont know why. I guess I was so upset, I wasnt 
thinking clearly. 

They were nearly to the bottom of the hill when I saw Mike catch up to 
them. He ran alongside Larry, holding his swollen hand. 

Can I come, too? Mike pleaded. Someone has to look at my hand. Its really 
bad, Larry. Pleasecan I come, too? 

Yeah. Youd better, I heard Larry reply curtly. 

Good, I thought. Finally someone was going to pay some attention to Mikes 
snakebite wound. 

Ignoring the sweat pouring down my forehead, I watched them make their 
way up the hill to the lodge. 

This shouldnt have happened, I thought, suddenly feeling a chill despite the 
hot sun. 

Something is wrong. Something is terribly wrong here. 

How was I to know that the horrors were just beginning?

Later that afternoon, Jay and I were writing our letters to our parents. I was 
feeling pretty upset about things. I kept seeing the angry expression on Larrys 
face as he heaved the ball at the back of Colins head. 

I wrote about it in my letter, and I also told my mom and dad about how 
there was no nurse here, and about the Forbidden Bunk. 

Jay stopped writing and looked at me from his bunk. He was really 
sunburned. His cheeks and forehead were bright red. 

He scratched his red hair. Were dropping like flies, he said, gesturing 
around the nearly empty cabin. 

Yeah, I agreed wistfully. I hope Colin and Mike are okay. And then I 
blurted out, Larry deliberately hit Colin. 

Huh? Jay stopped scratching his hair and lowered his hand to the bunk. He 
what ? 

He deliberately threw at Colins head. I saw him, I said, my voice shaky. I 
wasnt going to tell anyone, but now I was glad I did. It made me feel a little bit 
better to get it out. 

But then I saw that Jay didnt believe me. Thats impossible, he said quietly. 
Larrys our counselor. His hand slipped. Thats all. 

I started to argue when the cabin door opened and Colin entered, with Larry 
at his side. 

Colin! How are you? I cried. 

Jay and I both jumped down from our beds. 

Not bad, Colin replied. He forced a thin smile. I couldnt see his eyes. They 
were hidden once again behind his silver sunglasses. 

Hes still a little wobbly, but hes okay, Larry said cheerfully, holding Colins 

arm. 

Im sort of seeing double, Colin admitted. I mean, this cabin looks really 
crowded to me. There are two of each of you. 

Jay and I uttered short, uncomfortable laughs. 

Larry helped Colin over to his lower bunk. Hell be just fine in a day or two, 
Larry told us. 

Yeah. The headache is a little better already, Colin said, gently rubbing the 



back of his head, then lying down on top of the bedcovers. 

Did you see a doctor? I asked. 

Uh-uh. Just Uncle Al, Colin replied. He looked it over and said Id be fine. 

I cast a suspicious glance at Larry, but he turned his back on us and 
crouched down to search for something in the duffel bag he kept under his bed. 

Wheres Mike? Is he okay? Jay asked Larry. 

Uh-huh, Larry answered without turning around. Hes fine. 

But where is he? I demanded. 

Larry shrugged. Still at the lodge, I guess. I dont really know. 

But is he coming back? I insisted. 

Larry shoved the bag under his bed and stood up. Have you guys finished 
your letters? he asked. Hurry and get changed for dinner. You can mail your 
letters at the lodge. 

He started for the door. Hey, dont forget tonight is Tent Night. You guys are 
sleeping in a tent tonight. 

We all groaned. But, Larry, its too cold out! Jay protested. 

Larry ignored him and turned away. 

Hey, Larry, do you have anything I can put on this sunburn? Jay called after 

him. 

No, Larry replied, and disappeared out the door. 

Jay and I helped Colin up to the lodge. He was still seeing double, and his 
headache was pretty bad. The three of us sat at the end of the long table nearest 
the window. A strong breeze blew cool air over the table, which felt good on our 
sunburned skin. 

We had some kind of meat with potatoes and gravy for dinner. It wasnt 
great, but I was so hungry, it didnt matter. Colin didnt have much of an appetite. 
He picked at the edges of his gray meat. 

The mess hall was as noisy as ever. Kids were laughing and shouting to 
friends across the long tables. At one table, the guys were throwing breadsticks 
back and forth like javelins. 

As usual, the counselors, dressed in their green and white, ate together at a 
table in the far corner and ignored us campers completely. 

The rumor spread that we were going to learn all of the camp songs after 
dinner. Guys were groaning and complaining about that. 

About halfway through dinner, Jay and the boy across the table, a kid 



named Roger, started horsing around, trying to wrestle a breadstick from each 
other. Jay pulled hard and won the breadstickand spilled his entire cup of grape 
juice on my tan shorts. 

Hey! I jumped up angrily, staring down as the purple stain spread across the 
front of my shorts. 

Billy had an accident! Roger cried out. And everyone laughed. 

Yeah. He purpled in his pants! Jay added. 

Everyone thought that was hilarious. Someone threw a breadstick at me. It 
bounced off my chest and landed on my dinner plate. More laughter. 

The food fight lasted only a few minutes. Then two of the counselors broke 
it up. I decided Id better run back to the bunk and change my shorts. As I hurried 
out, I could hear Jay and Roger calling out jokes about me. 

I ran full speed down the hill toward the bunks. I wanted to get back up to 
the mess hall in time for dessert. 

Pushing open the bunk door with my shoulder, I darted across the small 
room to the dresser and pulled open my drawer. 

Huh? 

To my surprise, I stared into an empty drawer. It had been completely 
cleaned out. 

Whats going on here? I asked aloud. Wheres my stuff? 

Confused, I took a step backand realized I had opened the wrong drawer. 
This wasnt my drawer. 

It was Mikes. 

I stared for a long while into the empty drawer. 

Mikes clothes had all been removed. I turned and looked for his trunk, 
which had been stacked on its side behind our bunk. 

Mikes trunk was gone, too. 

Mike wasnt coming back. 


* * * 


I was so upset, I ran back to the mess hall without changing my shorts. 

Panting loudly, I made my way to the counselors table and came up behind 
Larry. He was talking to the counselor next to him, a fat guy with long, scraggly 
blond hair. LarryMikes gone! I cried breathlessly. 

Larry didnt turn around. He kept talking to the other counselor as if I 



werent there. 

I grabbed Larrys shoulder. Larrylisten! I cried. Mikehes gone! 

Larry turned around slowly, his expression annoyed. Go back to your table, 
Billy, he snapped. This table is for counselors only. 

But what about Mike? I insisted shrilly. His stuff is gone. What happened to 
him? Is he okay? 

How should I know? Larry replied impatiently. 

Did they send him home? I asked, refusing to back away until I had some 
kind of an answer. 

Yeah. Maybe. Larry shrugged and lowered his gaze. You spilled something 
on your shorts. 

My heart was pounding so hard, I could feel the blood pulsing at my 
temples. You really dont know what happened to Mike? I asked, feeling 
defeated. 

Larry shook his head. Im sure hes fine, he replied, turning back to his pals. 

He probably went for a swim, the scraggly haired guy next to him 
snickered. 

Larry and some of the other counselors laughed, too. 

I didnt think it was funny. I felt pretty sick. And a little frightened. 

Dont the counselors at this camp care what happens to us? I asked myself 
glumly. 

I made my way back to the table. They were passing out chocolate pudding 
for dessert, but I wasnt hungry. 

I told Colin and Jay and Roger about Mikes dresser drawer being cleaned 
out, and about how Larry pretended he didnt know anything about it. They didnt 
get as upset about it as I was. 

Uncle A1 probably had to send Mike home because of his hand, Colin said 
quietly, spooning up his pudding. It was pretty swollen. 

But why wouldnt Larry tell me the truth? I asked, my stomach still feeling 
as if I had eaten a giant rock for dinner. Why did he say he didnt know what 
happened to Mike? 

Counselors dont like to talk about bad stuff, Jay said, slapping the top of his 
pudding with his spoon. It might give us poor little kids nightmares. He filled his 
spoon with pudding, tilted it back, and flung a dark gob of pudding onto Rogers 
forehead. 

Jayyoure dead meat now! Roger cried, plunging his spoon into the 



chocolate goo. He shot a gob of it onto the front of Jays sleeveless T-shirt. 

That started a pudding war that spread down the long table. 

There was no more talk about Mike. 

After dinner, Uncle A1 talked about Tent Night and what a great time we 
were going to have sleeping in tents tonight. Just be very quiet so the bears cant 
find you! he joked. Some joke. 

Then he and the counselors taught us the camp songs. Uncle A1 made us 
sing them over and over until we learned them. 

I didnt feel much like singing. But Jay and Roger began making up really 
gross words to the songs. And pretty soon, a whole bunch of us joined in, 
singing our own versions of the songs as loudly as we could. 

Later, we were all making our way down the hill toward our tents. It was a 
cool, clear night. A wash of pale stars covered the purple-black sky. 

I helped Colin down the hill. He was still seeing double and feeling a little 
weak. 

Jay and Roger walked a few steps ahead of us, shoving each other with 
their shoulders, first to the left, then to the right. 

Suddenly, Jay turned back to Colin and me. Tonights the night, he 
whispered, a devilish grin spreading across his face. 

Huh? Tonights what night? I demanded. 

Ssshhh. He raised a finger to his lips. When everyones asleep, Roger and I 
are going to go check out the Forbidden Bunk. He turned to Colin. You with us? 

Colin shook his head sadly. I dont think I can, Jay. 

Walking backward in front of us, Jay locked his eyes on mine. How about 
you, Billy? You coming? 



10 


II think Ill stay with Colin, I told him. 

I heard Roger mutter something about me being a chicken. Jay looked 
disappointed. Youre going to miss out, he said. 

Thats okay. Im kind of tired, I said. It was true. I felt so weary after this 
long day, every muscle ached. Even my hair hurt! 

Jay and Roger made whispered plans all the way back to the tent. 

At the bottom of the hill, I stopped and gazed up at the Forbidden Bunk. It 
appeared to lean toward me in the pale starlight. I listened for the familiar howls 
that seemed to come from inside it. But tonight there was only a heavy silence. 

The large plastic tents were lined up in the bunk area. I crawled into ours 
and lay down on top of my sleeping bag. The ground was really hard. I could see 
this was going to be a long night. 

Jay and Colin were messing around with their sleeping bags at the back of 
the tent. It seems weird without Mike here, I said, feeling a sudden chill. 

Now youll have more room to put your stuff, Jay replied casually. He sat 
hunched against the tent wall, his expression tense, his eyes on the darkness 
outside the tent door, which was left open a few inches. 

Larry was nowhere in sight. Colin sat quietly. He still wasnt feeling right. 

I shifted my weight and stretched out, trying to find a comfortable position. 
I really wanted to go to sleep. But I knew I wouldnt be able to sleep until after 
Jay and Roger returned from their adventure. 

Time moved slowly. It was cold outside, and the air was heavy and wet 
inside the tent. 

I stared up at the dark plastic tent walls. A bug crawled across my forehead. 
I squashed it with my hand. 

I could hear Jay and Colin whispering behind me, but I couldnt make out 
their words. Jay snickered nervously. 

I must have dozed off. An insistent whispering sound woke me up. It took 
me a while to realize it was someone whispering outside the tent. 

I lifted my head and saw Rogers face peering in. I sat up, alert. 

Wish us luck, Jay whispered. 

Good luck, I whispered back, my voice clogged from sleep. 



In the darkness, I saw Jays large shadowy form crawl quickly to the tent 
door. He pushed it open, revealing a square of purple sky, then vanished into the 
darkness. 

I shivered. Lets sneak back to the bunk, I whispered to Colin. Its too cold 
out here. And the ground feels like solid rock. 

Colin agreed. We both scrambled out of the tent and made our way silently 
to our nice, warm bunk. Inside, we headed to the window to try to see Jay and 
Roger. 

Theyre going to get caught, I whispered. I just know it. 

They wont get caught, Colin disagreed. But they wont see anything, either. 
Theres nothing to see up there. Its just a stupid cabin. 

Poking my head out the window, I could hear Jay and Roger giggling 
quietly somewhere out in the dark. The camp was so silent, so eerily silent. I 
could hear their whispers, their legs brushing through the tall grass. 

Theyd better be quiet, Colin muttered, leaning against the window frame. 
Theyre making too much noise. 

They must be up to the hill by now, I whispered. I stuck my head out as far 
as I could, but I couldnt see them. 

Colin started to reply, but the first scream made him stop. 

It was a scream of horror that cut through the silent air. 

Oh! I cried out, and pulled my head in. 

Was that Jay or Roger? Colin asked, his voice trembling. 

The second scream was more terrifying than the first. 

Before it died down, I heard animal snarls. Loud and angry. Like an 
eruption of thunder. 

Then I heard Jays desperate plea: Help us! Pleasesomebody help us! 

My heart thudding in my chest, I lurched to the cabin door and pulled it 
open. The hideous screams still ringing in my ears, I plunged out into the 
darkness, the dew-covered ground soaking my bare feet. 

Jaywhere are you? I heard myself calling, but I didnt recognize my shrill, 
frightened voice. 

And then I saw a dark form running toward me, running bent over, arms 
outstretched. 

Jay! I cried. What/s it? What happened? 

He ran up to me, still bent forward, his face twisted in horror, his eyes wide 
and unblinking. His bushy hair appeared to stand straight up. 



Itit got Roger, he moaned, his chest heaving as he struggled to straighten 
up. 

What did? I demanded. 

What was it? Colin asked, right behind me. 

II dont know! Jay stammered, shutting his eyes tight. Itit tore Roger to 
pieces. 

Jay uttered a loud sob. Then he opened his eyes and spun around in terror. 
Here it comes! he shrieked. Now its coming after us! 



11 


In the pale starlight, I saw Jays eyes roll up in his head. His knees collapsed, and 
he began to slump to the ground. 

I grabbed him before he fell and dragged him into the cabin. Colin slammed 
the door behind us. 

Once inside, Jay recovered slowly. The three of us froze in place and 
listened hard. I was still holding on to Jays heaving shoulders. He was as pale as 
a bedsheet, and his breath came out in short, frightened moans. 

We listened. 

Silence. 

The air hung frozen and still. 

Nothing moved. 

No footsteps. No animal approaching. 

Just Jays frightened moans and the pounding of my heart. 

And then, somewhere far in the distance, I heard the howl. Soft and low at 
first, then rising on the wind. A howl that chilled my blood and made me cry out. 

Its Sabre! 

Dont let it get me! Jay shrieked, covering his face with his hands. He 
dropped to his knees on the cabin floor. Dont let it get me! 

I raised my eyes to Colin, who was huddled against the wall, away from the 
window. We have to get Larry, I managed to choke out. We have to get help. 

But how? Colin demanded in a trembling voice. 

Dont let it get me! Jay repeated, crumpled on the floor. 

It isnt coming here, I told him, trying to sound certain, trying to sound 
soothing. Were okay inside the bunk, Jay. It isnt coming here. 

But it got Roger and Jay started. His entire body convulsed in a shudder of 
terror. 

Thinking about Roger, I felt a stab of fear in my chest. 

Was it really true? Was it true that Roger had been attacked by some kind of 
creature? That hed been slashed to pieces? 

Id heard the screams from the hillside. Two bloodcurdling screams. 

Theyd been so loud, so horrifying. Hadnt anyone else in camp heard them, 



too? Hadnt any other kids heard Rogers cries? Hadnt any counselors heard? 

I froze in place and listened. 

Silence. The whisper of the breeze rustling the tree leaves. 

No voices. No cries of alarm. No hurried footsteps. 

I turned back toward the others. Colin had helped Jay to his bunk. Where 
can Larry be? Colin asked. His eyes, for once not hidden behind the silver 
sunglasses, showed real fear. 

Where can everyone be? I asked, crossing my arms over my chest and 
starting to pace back and forth in the small space between the beds. There isnt a 
sound out there. 

I saw Jays eyes go wide with horror. He was staring at the open window. 
The creature he cried. Here it comes! Its coming through the window! 



12 


All three of us gaped in horror at the open window. 

But no creature jumped in. 

As I stared, frozen in the center of the cabin, I could see only darkness and 
a fringe of pale stars. 

Outside in the trees, crickets started up a shrill clatter. There was no other 
sound. 

Poor Jay was so frightened and upset, he was seeing things. 

Somehow Colin and I got him a little calmed down. We made him take off 
his sneakers and lie down on his bed. And we covered him up with three 
blankets to help him to stop trembling. 

Colin and I wanted to run for help. But we were too frightened to go 
outside. 

The three of us were up all night. Larry never showed up. 

Except for the crickets and the brush of the wind through the trees, the 
camp was silent. 

I think I must have finally dozed off just before dawn. I had strange 
nightmares about fires and people trying to run away. 

I was awakened by Colin shaking me hard. Breakfast, he said hoarsely. 
Hurry. Were late. 

I sat up groggily. Wheres Larry? 

He never showed, Colin replied, motioning to Larrys unused bunk. 

Weve got to find him! Weve got to tell him what happened! Jay cried, 
hurrying to the cabin door with his sneakers untied. 

Colin and I stumbled after him, both of us only half awake. It was a cool, 
gray morning. The sun was trying hard to poke through high white clouds. 

The three of us stopped halfway up the hill to the mess hall. Reluctantly, 
our eyes searched the ground around the Forbidden Bunk. 

I dont know what I expected to see. But there was no sign of Roger. 

No sign of any struggle. No dried blood on the ground. The tall grass wasnt 
bent or matted down. 

Weird, I heard Jay mutter, shaking his head. Thats weird. 

I tugged his arm to get him moving, and we hurried the rest of the way up 



to the lodge. 

The mess hall was as noisy as ever. Kids were laughing and shouting to 
each other. It all seemed perfectly normal. I guessed that no one had made an 
announcement about Roger yet. 

Some kids called to Colin and me. But we ignored them and searched for 
Roger, moving quickly through the aisles between the tables. 

No sign of him. 

I had a heavy, queasy feeling in my stomach as we hurried to the counselors 
table in the corner. 

Larry glanced up from a big plate of scrambled eggs and bacon as the three 
of us advanced on him. 

What happened to Roger? 

Is he okay? 

Where were you last night? 

Roger and I were attacked. 

We were afraid to go find you. 

All three of us bombarded Larry at once. 

His face was filled with confusion, and he raised both hands to silence us. 
Whoa, he said. Take a breath, guys. What are you talking about? 

About Roger! Jay screamed, his face turning bright red. The creatureit 
jumped on him. Andand 

Larry glanced at the other counselors at the table, who looked as confused 
as he did. Creature? What creature? Larry demanded. 

It attacked Roger! Jay screamed. It was coming after me and 

Larry stared up at Jay. Someone was attacked? I dont think so, Jay. He 
turned to the counselor next to him, a pudgy boy named Derek. Did you hear 
anything in your area? 

Derek shook his head. 

Isnt Roger in your group? Larry asked Derek. 

Derek shook his head. Not in my group. 

But Roger Jay insisted. 

We didnt get any report about any attack, Larry said, interrupting. If a 
camper was attacked by a bear or something, wed hear about it. 

And wed hear the noise, Derek offered. You know. Screams or something. 

I heard screams, I told them. 

We both heard screams, Colin added quickly. And Jay came running back, 



crying for help. 

Well, why didnt anyone else hear it? Larry demanded, turning his gaze on 
Jay. His expression changed. Where did this happen? When? he asked 
suspiciously. 

Jays face darkened to a deeper red. After lights-out, he admitted. Roger and 
I went up to the Forbidden Bunk, and 

Are you sure it wasnt a bear? Derek interrupted. Some bears were spotted 
downriver yesterday afternoon. 

It was a creature! Jay screamed angrily. 

You shouldnt have been out, Larry said, shaking his head. 

Why wont you listen to me? Jay screamed. Roger was attacked. This big 
thing jumped on him and 

We would have heard something, Derek said calmly, glancing at Larry. 

Yeah, Larry agreed. The counselors were all up here at the lodge. We 
wouldve heard any screams. 

But, Larryyouve got to check it out! I cried. Jay isnt making it up. It really 
happened! 

Okay, okay, Larry replied, raising his hands as if surrendering. Ill go ask 
Uncle A1 about it, okay? 

Hurry, Jay insisted. Please! 

Ill ask Uncle A1 after breakfast, Larry said, turning back to his eggs and 
bacon. Ill see you guys at morning swim later. Ill report what Uncle A1 says. 

But, Larry Jay pleaded. 

Ill ask Uncle Al, Larry said firmly. If anything happened last night, hell 
know about it. He raised a strip of bacon to his mouth and chewed on it. I think 
you just had a bad nightmare or something, he continued, eyeing Jay 
suspiciously. But Ill let you know what Uncle Al says. 

It wasnt a nightmare! Jay cried shrilly. Larry turned his back on us and 
continued eating his breakfast. Dont you care? Jay screamed at him. Dont you 
care what happens to us? 

I saw that a lot of kids had stopped eating their breakfast to gawk at us. I 
pulled Jay away and tried to get him to go to our table. But he insisted on 
searching the entire mess hall again. I know Roger isnt here, he insisted. Hehe 
cant be! 

For the second time, the three of us made our way up and down the aisles 
between the tables, studying every face. 



One thing was for sure: Roger was nowhere to be seen. 


The sun burned through the high clouds just as we reached the waterfront for 
morning swim. The air was still cool. The thick, leafy shrubs along the riverbank 
glistened wetly in the white glare of sunlight. 

I dropped my towel under a bush and turned to the gently flowing green 
water. Ill bet its cold this morning, I said to Colin, who was retying the string on 
his swim trunks. 

I just want to go back to the bunk and go to sleep, Colin said, plucking at a 
knot. He wasnt seeing double any longer, but he was tired from being up all 
night. 

Several guys were already wading into the river. They were complaining 
about the cold water, splashing each other, shoving each other forward. 

Wheres Larry? Jay demanded breathlessly, pushing his way through the 
clump of shrubs to get to us. His red hair was a mess, half of it standing straight 
up on the side of his head. His eyes were red-rimmed and bloodshot. 

Wheres Larry? He promised hed be here, Jay said, frantically searching the 
waterfront. 

Here I am. The three of us spun around as Larry appeared from the bushes 
behind us. He was wearing baggy green Camp Nightmoon swim trunks. 

Well? Jay demanded. What did Uncle A1 say? About Roger? 

Larrys expression was serious. His eyes locked on Jays. Uncle A1 and I 
went all around the Forbidden Bunk, he told Jay. There wasnt any attack there. 
There couldnt have been. 

But itit got Roger, Jay cried shrilly. It slashed him. I saw it! 

Larry shook his head, his eyes still burning into Jays. Thats the other thing, 
he said softly. Uncle A1 and I went up to the office and checked the records, Jay. 
And there is no camper here this year named Roger. Not a first name or a middle 
name. No Roger. No Roger at all. 



13 


Jays mouth dropped open, and he uttered a low gasp. 

The three of us stared in disbelief at Larry, letting this startling news sink 
in. 

Someones made a mistake, Jay said finally, his voice trembling with 
emotion. We searched the mess hall for him, Larry. And hes gone. Roger isnt 
here. 

He never was here, Larry said without any emotion at all. 

II just dont believe this! Jay cried. 

How about a swim, guys? Larry said, motioning to the water. 

Well, what do you think? I demanded of Larry. I couldnt believe he was 
being so calm about this. What do you think happened last night? 

Larry shrugged. I dont know what to think, he replied, his eyes on the 
cluster of swimmers farthest from the shore. Maybe you guys are trying to pull a 
weird joke on me. 

Huh? Is that what you think? Jay cried. That its a joke?\ 

Larry shrugged again. Swim time, guys. Get some exercise, okay? 

Jay started to say more, but Larry quickly turned and went running into the 
green water. He took four or five running steps off the shore, then dived, pulling 
himself quickly through the water, taking long, steady strokes. 

Im not going in, Jay insisted angrily. Im going back to the bunk. His face 
was bright red. His chin was trembling. I could see that he was about to cry. He 
turned and began running through the bushes, dragging his towel along the 
ground. 

Hey, wait up! Colin went running after him. 

I stood there trying to decide what to do. I didnt want to follow Jay to the 
bunk. There wasnt anything I could do to help him. 

Maybe a cold swim will make me feel better, I thought. 

Maybe nothing will make me feel better, I told myself glumly. 

I stared out at the other guys in the water. Larry and another counselor were 
setting up a race. I could hear them discussing what kind of stroke should be 
used. 

They all seem to be having a great time, I thought, watching them line up. 



So why arent I? 

Why have I been so frightened and unhappy since I arrived here? Why dont 
the other campers see how weird and frightening this place is? 

I shook my head, unable to answer my questions. 

I need a swim, I decided. 

I took a step toward the water. 

But someone reached out from the bushes and grabbed me roughly from 
behind. 

I started to scream out in protest. 

But my attacker quickly clamped a hand over my mouth to silence me. 



14 


I tried to pull away, but Id been caught off guard. 

As the hands tugged me, I lost my balance and I was pulled back into the 
bushes. 

Is this a joke? Whats going on? I wondered. 

Suddenly, as I tried to tug myself free, the hands let go. 

I went sailing headfirst into a clump of fat green leaves. 

It took me a long moment to pull myself up. Then I spun around to face my 
attacker. 

Dawn! I cried. 

Ssshhhh! She leaped forward and clamped a hand over my mouth again. 
Duck down, she whispered urgently. Theyll see you. 

I obediently ducked behind the low bush. She let go of me again and moved 
back. She was wearing a blue one-piece bathing suit. It was wet. Her blond hair 
was also wet, dripping down onto her bare shoulders. 

Dawnwhat are you doing here? I whispered, settling onto my knees. 

Before Dawn could reply, another figure in a bathing suit moved quickly 
from the bushes, crouching low. It was Dawns friend Dori. 

We swam over. Early this morning, Dori whispered, nervously pushing at 
her curly red hair. We waited here. In the bushes. 

But its not allowed, I said, unable to hide my confusion. If youre caught 

We had to talk to you, Dawn interrupted, raising her head to peek over the 
top of the bushes, then quickly ducking back down. 

We decided to risk it, Dori added. 

Whatwhats wrong? I stammered. A red-and-black bug crawled up my 
shoulder. I brushed it away. 

The girls camp. Its a nightmare, Dori whispered. 

Everyone calls it Camp Nightmare instead of Camp Nightmoon, Dawn 
added. Strange things have been happening. 

Huh? I gaped at her. Not far from us in the water, I could hear the shouts 
and splashes of the swim race beginning. What kinds of strange things? 

Scary things, Dori replied, her expression solemn. 



Girls have disappeared, Dawn told me. Just vanished from sight. 

And no one seems to care, Dori added in a trembling whisper. 

I dont believe it! I uttered. The same thing has happened here. At the boys 
camp. I swallowed hard. Remember Mike? 

Both girls nodded. 

Mike disappeared, I told them. They removed his stuff, and he just 
disappeared. 

Its unbelievable, Dori said. Three girls are gone from our camp. 

They announced that one was attacked by a bear, Dawn whispered. 

What about the other two? I asked. 

Just gone, Dawn replied, the words catching in her throat. 

I could hear whistles blowing in the water. The race had ended. Another 
one was being organized. 

The sun disappeared once again behind high white clouds. Shadows 
lengthened and grew darker. 

I told them quickly about Roger and Jay and the attack at the Forbidden 
Bunk. They listened in openmouthed silence. Just like at our camp, Dawn said. 

We have to do something, Dori said heatedly. 

We have to get together. The boys and the girls, Dawn whispered, peering 
once again over the tops of the leaves. We have to make a plan. 

You mean to escape? I asked, not really understanding. 

The two girls nodded. We cant stay here, Dawn said grimly. Every day 
another girl disappears. And the counselors act as if nothing is happening. 

I think they want us to get killed or something, Dori added with emotion. 

Have you written to your parents? I asked. 

We write every day, Dori replied. But we havent heard from them. 

I suddenly realized that I hadnt received any mail from my parents, either. 
They had both promised to write every day. But I had been at camp for nearly a 
week, and I hadnt received a single piece of mail. 

Visitors Day is next week, I said. Our parents will be here. We can tell them 
everything. 

It may be too late, Dawn said grimly. 

Everyone is so scared! Dori declared. I havent slept in two nights. I hear 
these horrible screams outside every night. 

Another whistle blew, closer to shore. I could hear the swimmers returning. 
Morning swim was ending. 



II dont know what to say, I told them. Youve got to be careful. Dont get 
caught. 

Well swim back to the girls camp when everyone has left, Dawn said. But 
we have to meet again, Billy. We have to get more guys together. You know. 
Maybe if we all get organized Her voice trailed off. 

Theres something bad going on at this camp, Dori said with a shiver, 
narrowing her eyes. Something evil. 

II know, I agreed. I could hear boys voices now. Close by. Just on the other 
side of the leafy bushes. Ive got to go. 

Well try to meet here again the day after tomorrow, Dawn whispered. Be 
careful, Billy. 

You be careful, I whispered. Dont get caught. 

They slipped back, deeper in the bushes. 

Crouching low, I made my way away from the shore. When I was past the 
clump of bushes, I stood up and began to run. I couldnt wait to tell Colin and Jay 
about what the girls had said. 

I felt frightened and excited at the same time. I thought maybe it would 
make Jay feel a little better to know that the same kinds of horrible things were 
happening across the river at the girls camp. 

Halfway to the bunks, I had an idea. I stopped and turned toward the lodge. 

I suddenly remembered seeing a pay phone on the wall on the side of the 
building. Someone had told me that phone was the only one campers were 
allowed to use. 

III call Mom and Dad, I decided. 

Why hadnt I thought of it before? 

I can call my parents, I realized, and tell them everything. I can ask them to 
come and get me. And they could get Jay, Colin, Dawn, and Dori, too. 

Behind me, I saw my group heading toward the scratchball field, their 
swimming towels slung over their shoulders. I wondered if anyone had noticed 
that I was missing. 

Jay and Colin were missing, too, I told myself. Larry and the others 
probably think Im with them. 

I watched them trooping across the tall grass in twos and threes. Then I 
turned and started jogging up the hill toward the lodge. 

The idea of calling home had cheered me up already. 

I was so eager to hear my parents voices, so eager to tell them the strange 



things that were happening here. 

Would they believe me? 

Of course they would. My parents always believed me. Because they 
trusted me. 

As I ran up the hill, the dark pay phone came into view on the white lodge 
wall. I started to run at full speed. I wanted to fly to the phone. 

I hope Mom and Dad are home, I thought. 

Theyve got to be home. 

I was panting loudly as I reached the wall. I lowered my hands to my knees 
and crouched there for a moment, waiting to catch my breath. 

Then I reached up to take the receiver down. 

And gasped. 

The pay phone was plastic. Just a stage prop. 

A phony. 

It was a thin sheet of molded plastic held to the wall by a nail, made to look 
just like a telephone. 

It wasnt real. It was a fake. 

They dont want us to call out, I thought with a sudden chill. 

My heart thudding, my head spinning in bitter disappointment, I turned 
away from the walland bumped right into Uncle Al. 



15 


Billywhat are you doing up here? Unde A1 asked. He was wearing baggy green 
camp shorts and a sleeveless white T-shirt that revealed his meaty pink arms. He 
carried a brown clipboard filled with papers. Where are you supposed to be? 

I uh wanted to make a phone call, I stammered, taking a step back. I wanted 
to call my parents. 

He eyed me suspiciously and fingered his yellow mustache. Really? 

Yeah. Just to say hi, I told him. But the phone 

Uncle A1 followed my gaze to the plastic phone. He chuckled. Someone put 
that up as a joke, he said, grinning at me. Did it fool you? 

Yeah, I admitted, feeling my face grow hot. I raised my eyes to his. Where 
is the real phone? 

His grin faded. His expression turned serious. No phone, he replied sharply. 
Campers arent allowed to call out. Its a rule, Billy. 

Oh. I didnt know what to say. 

Are you really homesick? Uncle A1 asked softly. 

I nodded. 

Well, go write your mom and dad a long letter, he said. Itll make you feel a 
lot better. 

Okay, I said. I didnt think it would make me feel better. But I wanted to get 
away from Uncle Al. 

He raised his clipboard and gazed at it. Where are you supposed to be now? 
he asked. 

Scratchball, I think, I replied. I didnt feel too well, see. So I 

And when is your canoe trip? he asked, not listening to me. He flipped 
through the sheets of paper on the clipboard, glancing over them quickly. 

Canoe trip? I hadnt heard about any canoe trip. 

Tomorrow, he said, answering his own question. Your group goes 
tomorrow. Are you excited? He lowered his eyes to mine. 

II didnt really know about it, I confessed. 

Lots of fun! he exclaimed enthusiastically. The river doesnt look like much 
up here. But it gets pretty exciting a few miles down. Youll find yourself in some 
good rapids. 



He squeezed my shoulder briefly. Youll enjoy it, he said, grinning. 
Everyone always enjoys the canoe trip. 

Great, I said. I tried to sound a little excited, but my voice came out flat and 
uncertain. 

Uncle A1 gave me a wave with his clipboard and headed around toward the 
front of the lodge, taking long strides. I stood watching him till he disappeared 
around the corner of the building. Then I made my way down the hill to the 
bunk. 

I found Colin and Jay on the grass at the side of the cabin. Colin had his 
shirt off and was sprawled on his back, his hands behind his head. Jay sat cross- 
legged beside him, nervously pulling up long, slender strands of grass, then 
tossing them down. 

Come inside, I told them, glancing around to make sure no one else could 

hear. 

They followed me into the cabin. I closed the door. 

Whats up? Colin asked, dropping onto his bunk. He picked up his red 
bandanna and twisted it in his hands. 

I told them about Dawn and Dori and what they had reported about the girls 
camp. 

Colin and Jay both reacted with shock. 

They really swam over here and waited for you? Jay asked. 

I nodded. They think we have to get organized or escape or something, I 

said. 

They could get in big trouble if they get caught, Jay said thoughtfully. 

Were all in big trouble, I told him. We have to get out! 

Visitors Day is next week, Colin muttered. 

Im going to write my parents right now, I said, pulling out the case from 
under my bunk where I kept my paper and pens. Im going to tell them I have to 
come home on Visitors Day. 

I guess I will, too, Jay said, tapping his fingers nervously against the bunk 
frame. 

Me, too, Colin agreed. Its just too weird here! 

I pulled out a couple of sheets of paper and sat down on the bed to write. 
Dawn and Dori were really scared, I told them. 

So am I, Jay admitted. 

I started to write my letter. I wrote Dear Mom and Dad, HELP! then 



stopped. I raised my eyes across the cabin to Jay and Colin. Do you guys know 
about the canoe trip tomorrow? I asked. 

They stared back at me, their expressions surprised. 

Whoa! Colin declared. A three-mile hike this afternoon, and a canoe trip 
tomorrow? 

It was my turn to be surprised. Hike? What hike? 

Arent you coming on it? Jay asked. 

You know that really tall counselor? Frank? The one who wears the yellow 
cap? Colin asked. He told Jay and me were going on a three-mile hike after 
lunch. 

No one told me, I replied, chewing on the end of my pen. 

Maybe youre not in the hike group, Jay said. 

Youd better ask Frank at lunch, Colin suggested. Maybe he couldnt find 
you. Maybe youre supposed to come, too. 

I groaned. Who wants to go on a three-mile hike in this heat? 

Colin and Jay both shrugged. 

Frank said wed really like it, Colin told me, knotting and unknotting the red 
bandanna. 

I just want to get out of here, I said, returning to my letter. 

I wrote quickly, intensely. I wanted to tell my parents all the frightening, 
strange things that had happened. I wanted to make them see why I couldnt stay 
at Camp Nightmoon. 

I had written nearly a page and a half, and I was up to the part where Jay 
and Roger went out to explore the Forbidden Bunk, when Larry burst in. You 
guys taking the day off? he asked, his eyes going from one of us to the other. 
You on vacation or something? 

Just hanging out, Jay replied. 

I folded up my letter and started to tuck it under my pillow. I didnt want 
Larry to see it. I realized I didnt trust Larry at all. I had no reason to. 

What are you doing, Billy? he asked suspiciously, his eyes stopping on the 
letter I was shoving under the pillow. 

Just writing home, I replied softly. 

You homesick or something? he asked, a grin spreading across his face. 

Maybe, I muttered. 

Well, its lunchtime, guys, he announced. Lets hustle, okay? 

We all climbed out of our bunks. 



Jay and Colin are going on a hike with Frank this afternoon, I heard, Larry 
said. Lucky guys. He turned and started out the door. 

Larry! I called to him. Hey, Larrywhat about me? Am I supposed to go on 
the hike too? 

Not today, he called back. 

But why not? I said. 

But Larry disappeared out the door. 

I turned back to my two bunk mates. Lucky guys! I teased them. 

They both growled back at me in reply. Then we headed up the hill to 
lunch. 

They served pizza for lunch, which is usually my favorite. But today, the pizza 
was cold and tasted like cardboard, and the cheese stuck to the roof of my 
mouth. 

I wasnt really hungry. 

I kept thinking about Dawn and Dori, how frightened they were, how 
desperate. I wondered when Id see them again. I wondered if they would swim 
over and hide at the boys camp again before Visitors Day. 

After lunch, Frank came by our table to pick up Jay and Colin. I asked him 
if I was supposed to come, too. 

You werent on the list, Billy, he said, scratching at a mosquito bite on his 
neck. I can only take two at a time, you know? The trail gets a little dangerous. 

Dangerous? Jay asked, climbing up from the table. 

Frank grinned at him. Youre a big strong guy, he told Jay. Youll do okay. 

I watched Frank lead Colin and Jay out of the mess hall. Our table was 
empty now, except for a couple of blond-haired guys I didnt know who were arm 
wrestling down at the end near the wall. 

I pushed my tray away and stood up. I wanted to go back to the bunk and 
finish the letter to my parents. But as I took a few steps toward the door, I felt a 
hand on my shoulder. 

I turned to see Larry grinning down at me. Tennis tournament, he said. 

Huh? I reacted with surprise. 

Billy, youre representing Bunk Four in the tennis tournament, Larry said. 
Didnt you see the lineup? It was posted on the announcements board. 

But Im a terrible tennis player! I protested. 

Were counting on you, Larry replied. Get a racket and get your bod to the 



courts! 

I spent the afternoon playing tennis. I beat a little kid in straight sets. I had 
the feeling he had never held a tennis racket before. Then I lost a long, hard- 
fought match to one of the blond-haired boys whod been arm wrestling at lunch. 

I was drowning in sweat, and every muscle in my body ached when the 
match was over. I headed to the waterfront for a refreshing swim. 

Then I returned to the bunk, changed into jeans and a green-and-white 
Camp Nightmoon T-shirt, and finished my letter to my parents. 

It was nearly dinnertime. Jay and Colin werent back from their hike yet. I 
decided to go up to the lodge and mail my letter. As I headed up the hill, I saw 
clusters of kids hurrying to their bunks to change for dinner. But no sign of my 
two bunk mates. 

Holding the letter tightly, I headed around to the back of the lodge building, 
where the camp office was located. The door was wide open, so I walked in. A 
young woman was usually behind the counter to answer questions and to take 
the letters to be mailed. 

Anyone here? I called, leaning over the counter and peering into the tiny 
back room, which was dark. 

No reply. 

Hi. Anyone here? I repeated, clutching the envelope. 

No. The office was empty. 

Disappointed, I started to leave. Then I glimpsed the large burlap bag on the 
floor just inside the tiny back room. 

The mailbag! 

I decided to put my letter in the bag with the others to be mailed. I slipped 
around the counter and into the back room and crouched down to put my 
envelope into the bag. 

To my surprise, the mailbag was stuffed full with letters. As I pulled the bag 
open and started to shove my letter inside, a bunch of letters fell out onto the 
floor. 

I started to scoop them up when a letter caught my eye. 

It was one of mine. Addressed to my parents. 

One I had written yesterday. 

Weird, I muttered aloud. 

Bending over the bag, I reached in and pulled out a big handful of letters. I 
sifted through them quickly. I found a letter Colin had written. 



I pulled out another pile. 

And my eyes fell upon two other letters I had written nearly a week ago 
when I first arrived at camp. 

I stared at them, feeling a cold chill run down my back. 

All of our letters, all of the letters we had written since the first day of 
camp, were here. In this mailbag. 

None of them had been mailed. 

We couldnt call home. 

And we couldnt write home. 

Frantically, my hands trembling, I began shoving the envelopes back into 
the mailbag. 

What is going on here? I wondered. What is going on? 



16 


By the time I got into the mess hall, Uncle A1 was finishing the evening 
announcements. I slid into my seat, hoping I hadnt missed anything important. 

I expected to see Jay and Colin across the table from me. But their places 
on the bench were empty. 

Thats strange, I thought, still shaken from my discovery about the mailbag. 
They should be back by now. 

I wanted to tell them about the mail. I wanted to share the news that our 
parents werent getting any of the letters we wrote. 

And we werent getting any of theirs. 

The camp had to be keeping our mail from us, I suddenly realized. 

Colin and Jaywhere are you? 

The fried chicken was greasy, and the mashed potatoes were lumpy and 
tasted like paste. As I forced the food down, I kept turning to glance at the mess 
hall door, expecting to see my two bunk mates. 

But they didnt show up. 

A heavy feeling of dread formed in my stomach. Through the mess hall 
window, I could see that it was already dark outside. 

Where could they be? 

A three-mile hike and back shouldnt take this many hours. 

I pulled myself up and made my way to the counselors table in the corner. 
Larry was having a loud argument about sports with two of the other counselors. 
They were shouting and gesturing with their hands. 

Franks chair was empty. 

Larry, did Frank get back? I interrupted their discussion. 

Larry turned, a startled expression on his face. Frank? He motioned to the 
empty chair at the table. Guess not. 

He took Jay and Colin on the hike, I said. Shouldnt they be back by now? 

Larry shrugged. Beats me. He returned to his argument, leaving me 
standing there staring at Franks empty chair. 

After the trays had been cleared, we pushed the tables and benches against 
the wall and had indoor relay races. Everyone seemed to be having a great time. 
The shouts and cheers echoed off the high-raftered ceiling. 



I was too worried about Jay and Colin to enjoy the games. 

Maybe they decided to camp out overnight, I told myself. 

But I had seen them leave, and I knew they hadnt taken any tents or 
sleeping bags or other overnight supplies. 

So where were they? 

The games ended a little before lights-out. As I followed the crowd to the 
door, Larry appeared beside me. Were leaving early tomorrow, he said. First 
thing. 

Huh? I didnt understand what he meant. 

The canoe trip. Im the canoe counselor. Ill be taking you guys, he 
explained, seeing my confusion. 

Oh. Okay, I replied without enthusiasm. I was so worried about Jay and 
Colin, Id nearly forgotten about the canoe trip. 

Right after breakfast, Larry said. Wear a bathing suit. Bring a change of 
clothes. Meet me at the waterfront. He hurried back to help the other counselors 
pull the tables into place. 

After breakfast, I muttered. I wondered if Jay and Colin were also coming 
on the canoe trip. I had forgotten to ask Larry. 

I headed quickly down the dark hill. The dew had already fallen, and the 
tall grass was slippery and wet. Halfway down, I could see the dark outline of 
the Forbidden Bunk, hunched forward as if preparing to strike. 

Forcing myself to look away, I jogged the rest of the way to Bunk 4. 

To my surprise, I could see through the window that someone was moving 
around inside. 

Colin and Jay are back! I thought. 

Eagerly, I pushed open the door and burst inside. Heywhereve you guys 
been? I cried. 

I stopped short. And gasped. 

Two strangers stared back at me. 

One was sitting on the edge of Colins bunk, pulling off his sneakers. The 
other was leaning over the dresser, pulling a T-shirt from one of the drawers. 

Hi. You in here? the boy at the dresser stood up straight, his eyes studying 
me. He had very short black hair and a gold stud in one ear. 

I swallowed hard. Am I in the wrong bunk? Is this Bunk Four? 

They both stared at me, confused. 

I saw that the other boy, the one in Colins bunk, also had black hair, but his 



was long and scraggly and fell over his forehead. Yeah. This is Bunk Four, he 
said. 

Were new, the short-haired boy added. Im Tommy, and hes Chris. We just 
started today. 

Hi, I said uncertainly. My names Billy. My heart was pounding like a tom¬ 
tom in my chest. Wherere Colin and Jay? 

Who? Chris asked. They told us this bunk was mostly empty. 

Well, Colin and Jay I started. 

We just arrived. We dont know anyone, Tommy interrupted. He pushed the 
drawer shut. 

But thats Jays drawer, I said, bewildered, pointing. What did you do with 
Jays stuff? 

Tommy gazed back at me in surprise. The drawer was empty, he replied. 

Almost all the drawers were empty, Chris added, tossing his sneakers to the 
floor. Except for the bottom two drawers. 

Thats my stuff, I said, my head spinning. But Colin and Jaytheir stuff was 
here, I insisted. 

The whole cabin was empty, Tommy said. Maybe your friends got moved. 

Maybe, I said weakly. I sat down on the lower bunk beneath my bed. My 
legs felt shaky. A million thoughts were whirring through my mind, all of them 
frightening. 

This is weird, I said aloud. 

Its not a bad bunk, Chris said, pulling down his blanket and settling in. 
Kind of cozy. 

How long you staying at camp? Tommy asked, pulling on an oversized 
white T-shirt. All summer? 

No! I exclaimed with a shudder. Im not staying! I sputtered. I mean I mean 
Im leaving. On uh Im leaving on Visitors Day next week. 

Chris flashed Tommy a surprised glance. Huh? When are you leaving? he 
asked again. 

On Visitors Day, I repeated. When my parents come up for Visitors Day. 

But didnt you hear Uncle Als announcement before dinner? Tommy asked, 
staring hard at me. Visitors Day has been canceled! 



17 


I drifted in and out of a troubled sleep that night. Even with the blanket pulled up 
to my chin, I felt chilled and afraid. 

It felt so weird to have two strange guys in the bunk, sleeping where Jay 
and Colin had slept. I was worried about my missing friends. 

What had happened to them? Why hadnt they come back? 

As I tossed restlessly in my top bunk, I heard howls off in the distance. 
Animal cries, probably coming from the Forbidden Bunk. Long, frightening 
howls carried by the wind into our open bunk windows. 

At one point, I thought I heard kids screaming. I sat up straight, suddenly 
alert, and listened. 

Had I dreamed the frightful shrieks? I was so scared and confused, it was 
impossible to tell what was real and what was a nightmare. 

It took hours to fall back to sleep. 

I awoke to a gray, overcast morning, the air heavy and cold. Pulling on 
swim trunks and a T-shirt, I raced to the lodge to find Larry. I had to find out 
what had happened to Jay and Colin. 

I searched everywhere for him without success. Larry wasnt at breakfast. 
None of the other counselors admitted to knowing anything. Frank, the 
counselor who had taken my two friends on the hike, was also not there. 

I finally found Larry at the waterfront, preparing a long metal canoe for our 
river trip. Larrywhere are they? I cried out breathlessly. 

He gazed up at me, holding an armload of canoe paddles. His expression 
turned to bewilderment. Huh? Chris and Tommy? Theyll be here soon. 

No! I cried, grabbing his arm. Jay and Colin! Where are they? What 
happened to them, Larry? Youve got to tell me! 

I gripped his arm tightly. I was gasping for breath. I could feel the blood 
pulsing at my temples. Youve got to tell me! I repeated shrilly. 

He pulled away from me and let the paddles fall beside the canoe. I dont 
know anything about them, he replied quietly. 

But, Larry! 

Really, I dont, he insisted in the same quiet voice. His expression softened. 
He placed a hand on my trembling shoulder. Tell you what, Billy, he said, staring 



hard into my eyes. Ill ask Uncle A1 about it after our trip, okay? Ill find out for 
you. When we get back. 

I stared back at him, trying to decide if he was being honest. 

I couldnt tell. His eyes were as calm and cold as marbles. 

He leaned forward and pushed the canoe into the shallow river water. Here. 
Take one of those life preservers, he said, pointing to a pile of blue rubber vests 
behind me. Strap it on. Then get in. 

I did as he instructed. I saw that I had no choice. 

Chris and Tommy came running up to us a few seconds later. They 
obediently followed Larrys instructions and strapped on the life preserver vests. 

A few minutes later, the four of us were seated cross-legged inside the long, 
slender canoe, drifting slowly away from the shore. 

The sky was still charcoal gray, the sun hidden behind hovering dark 
clouds. The canoe bumped over the choppy river water. The current was stronger 
than I had realized. We began to pick up speed. The low trees and shrubs along 
the riverbank slid past rapidly. 

Larry sat facing us in the front of the canoe. He demonstrated how to 
paddle as the river carried us away. 

He watched carefully, a tight frown on his face, as the three of us struggled 
to pick up the rhythm he was showing us. Then, when we finally seemed to 
catch on, Larry grinned and carefully turned around, gripping the sides of the 
canoe as he shifted his position. 

The sun is trying to come out, he said, his voice muffled in the strong 
breeze over the rippling water. 

I glanced up. The sky looked darker than before. 

He stayed with his back to us, facing forward, allowing the three of us to do 
the paddling. I had never paddled a canoe before. It was harder than Id imagined. 
But as I fell into the rhythm of it with Tommy and Chris, I began to enjoy it. 

Dark water smacked against the prow of the canoe, sending up splashes of 
white froth. The current grew stronger, and we picked up speed. The air was still 
cold, but the steady work of rowing warmed me. After a while, I realized I was 
sweating. 

We rowed past tangles of yellow- and gray-trunked trees. The river 
suddenly divided in two, and we shifted our paddles to take the left branch. 
Larry began paddling again, working to keep us off the tall rocks that jutted 
between the river branches. 



The canoe bobbed up and slapped down. Bobbed up and slapped down. 
Cold water poured over the sides. 

The sky darkened even more. I wondered if it was about to storm. 

As the river widened, the current grew rapid and strong. I realized we didnt 
really need to paddle. The river was doing most of the work. 

The river sloped down. Wide swirls of frothing white water made the canoe 
leap and bounce. 

Here come the rapids! Larry shouted, cupping his hands around his mouth 
so we could hear him. Hang on! It gets pretty wild! 

I felt a tremor of fear as a wave of icy water splashed over me. The canoe 
rose up on a shelf of white water, then hit hard as it landed. 

I could hear Tommy and Chris laughing excitedly behind me. 

Another icy wave rolled over the canoe, startling me. I cried out and nearly 
let go of my paddle. 

Tommy and Chris laughed again. 

I took a deep breath and held on tightly to the paddle, struggling to keep up 
the rhythm. 

Hey, look! Larry cried suddenly. 

To my astonishment, he climbed to his feet. He leaned forward, pointing to 
the swirling white water. 

Look at those fish! 

As he leaned down, the canoe was jarred by a powerful rush of current. The 
canoe spun to the right. 

I saw the startled look on Larrys face as he lost his balance. His arms shot 
forward, and he plunged headfirst into the tossing waters. 

Noooooo! I screamed. 

I glanced back at Tommy and Chris, who had stopped paddling and were 
staring into the swirling murky waters, their expressions frozen in openmouthed 
horror. 

Larry! Larry! I was screaming the name over and over without realizing it. 

The canoe continued to slide rapidly down the churning waters. 

Larry didnt come up. 

Larry! 

Behind me, Tommy and Chris also called out his name, their voices shrill 
and frightened. 

Where was he? Why didnt he swim to the surface? 



The canoe was drifting farther and farther downriver. 

Larrrrrry! 

We have to stop! I screamed. We have to slow down! 

We cant! Chris shouted back. We dont know how! 

Still no sign of Larry. I realized he must be in trouble. 

Without thinking, I tossed my paddle into the river, climbed to my feet, and 
plunged into the murky swirling waters to save him. 



18 


I jumped without thinking and swallowed a mouthful of water as I went down. 

My heart thudded in my chest as I struggled frantically to the surface, 
sputtering and choking. 

Gasping in a deep breath, I lowered my head and tried to swim against the 
current. My sneakers felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds. 

I realized I should have pulled them off before I jumped. 

The water heaved and tossed. I moved my arms in long, desperate strokes, 
pulling myself toward the spot where Larry had fallen. Glancing back, I saw the 
canoe, a dark blur growing smaller and smaller. 

Wait! I wanted to shout to Tommy and Chris. Wait for me to get Larry! 

But I knew that they didnt know how to slow the canoe. They were helpless 
as the current carried them away. 

Where was Larry? 

I sucked in another mouthful of airand froze as I felt a sharp cramp in my 
right leg. 

The pain shot up through my entire right side. 

I slid under the water and waited for the pain to lessen. 

The cramp seemed to tighten until I could barely move my leg. Water 
rushed over me. I struggled to pull myself up to the surface. 

As I choked in more air, I stroked rapidly and hard, pulling myself up, 
ignoring the sharp pain in my leg. 

Hey! 

What was that object floating just ahead of me? A piece of driftwood being 
carried by the current? 

Murky water washed over me, blinding me, tossing me back. Sputtering, I 
pulled myself back up. 

Water rolled down my face. I struggled to see. 

Larry! 

He came floating right to me. 

Larry! Larry! I managed to scream. 

But he didnt answer me. I could see clearly now that he was floating 



facedown. 

The leg cramp started to loosen up as I reached out with both arms and 
grabbed Larrys shoulders. I pulled his head up from the water, rolled him onto 
his back, and wrapped my arm around his neck. I was using the lifesaving 
technique my parents had taught me. 

Turning downriver, I searched for the canoe. But the current had carried it 
out of sight. 

I swallowed another mouthful of icy water. Choking, I held on to Larry. I 
kicked hard. My right leg still felt tight and weak, but at least the pain had gone. 
Kicking and pulling with my free hand, I dragged Larry toward the shore. 

To my relief, the current helped. It seemed to pull in the same direction. 

A few seconds later, I was close enough to shore to stand. Wearily, panting 
like a wild animal, I tottered to my feet and dragged Larry onto the wet mud of 
the shore. 

Was he dead? Had he drowned before I reached him? 

I stretched him out on his back and, still panting loudly, struggling to catch 
my breath, to stop my entire body from trembling, I leaned over him. 

And he opened his eyes. 

He stared up at me blankly, as if he didnt recognize me. 

Finally, he whispered my name. Billy, he choked out, are we okay? 

Larry and I rested for a bit. Then we walked back to camp, following the river 
upstream. 

We were soaked clear through and drenched with mud, but I didnt care. We 
were alive. We were okay. I had saved Larrys life. 

We didnt talk much on the way back. It was taking every ounce of strength 
we had just to walk. 

I asked Larry if he thought Tommy and Chris would be okay. 

Hope so, he muttered, breathing hard. Theyll probably ride to shore and 
walk back like us. 

I took this opportunity to ask him again about Jay and Colin. I thought 
maybe Larry would tell me the truth since we were completely alone and since I 
had just saved his life. 

But he insisted he didnt know anything about my two bunk mates. As we 
walked, he raised one hand and swore he didnt know anything at all. 

So many frightening things have happened, I muttered. 



He nodded, keeping his eyes straight ahead. Its been strange, he agreed. 

I waited for him to say more. But he walked on in silence. 

It took three hours to walk back. We hadnt traveled downriver as far as I 
had thought, but the muddy shore kept twisting and turning, making our journey 
longer. 

As the camp came into view, my knees buckled and my legs nearly 
collapsed under me. 

Breathing hard, drenched in perspiration, our clothes still damp and covered 
in mud, we trudged wearily onto the waterfront. 

Hey! a voice called from the swim area. Uncle Al, dressed in baggy green 
sweats, came hurrying across the dirt to us. What happened? he asked Larry. 

We had an accident! I cried, before Larry had a chance to reply. 

I fell in, Larry admitted, his face reddening beneath the splattered mud. 
Billy jumped in and saved me. We walked back. 

But Tommy and Chris couldnt stop the canoe. They drifted away! I cried. 

We both nearly drowned, Larry told the frowning camp director. But 
Billyhe saved my life. 

Can you send someone to find Tommy and Chris? I asked, suddenly starting 
to shake all over, from exhaustion, I guess. 

The two boys floated on downriver? Uncle Al asked, staring hard at Larry, 
scratching the back of his fringe of yellow hair. 

Larry nodded. 

We have to find them! I insisted, trembling harder. 

Uncle Al continued to glare at Larry. What about my canoe? he demanded 
angrily. Thats our best canoe! How am I supposed to replace it? 

Larry shrugged unhappily. 

Well have to go look for that canoe tomorrow, Uncle Al snapped. 

He doesnt care about the two boys, I realized. He doesnt care about them at 
all. 

Go get into dry clothes, Uncle Al instructed Larry and me. He stormed off 
toward the lodge, shaking his head. 

I turned and started for the cabin, feeling chilled, my entire body still 
trembling. I could feel a strong wave of anger sweep over me. 

I had just saved Larrys life, but Uncle Al didnt care about that. 

And he didnt care that two campers were lost on the river. 

He didnt care that two campers and a counselor never returned from their 



hike. 


He didnt care that boys were attacked by creatures! 

He didnt care that kids disappeared and were never mentioned again. 

He didnt care about any of us. 

He only cared about his canoe. 

My anger quickly turned to fear. 

Of course, I had no way of knowing that the scariest part of my summer 
was still to come. 



19 


I was all alone in the bunk that night. 

I pulled an extra blanket onto my bed and slid into a tight ball beneath the 
covers. I wondered if Id be able to fall asleep. Or if my frightened, angry 
thoughts would keep me tossing and turning for another night. 

But I was so weary and exhausted, even the eerie, mournful howls from the 
Forbidden Bunk couldnt keep me awake. 

I fell into deep blackness and didnt wake up until I felt someone shaking 
my shoulders. 

Startled alert, I sat straight up. Larry! I cried, my voice still clogged with 
sleep. Whats happening? 

I squinted across the room. Larrys bed was rumpled, the blanket balled up 
at the end. He had obviously come in late and slept in the bunk. 

But Tommys and Chris beds were still untouched from the day before. 

Special hike, Larry said, walking over to his bunk. Hurry. Get dressed. 

Huh? I stretched and yawned. Outside the window, it was still gray. The sun 
hadnt risen. What kind of hike? 

Uncle A1 called a special hike, Larry replied, his back to me. He grabbed 
the sheet and started to make his bed. 

With a groan, I lowered myself to the cabin floor. It felt cold beneath my 
bare feet. Dont we get to rest? I mean, after what happened yesterday? I glanced 
once again at Tommys and Chris unused beds. 

Its not just us, Larry replied, smoothing the sheet. Its the whole camp. 
Everyones going. Uncle A1 is leading it. 

I pulled on a pair of jeans, stumbling across the cabin with one leg in. A 
sudden feeling of dread fell over me. It wasnt scheduled, I said darkly. Where is 
Uncle A1 taking us? 

Larry didnt reply. 

Where? I repeated shrilly. 

He pretended he didnt hear me. 

Tommy and Christhey didnt come back? I asked glumly, pulling on my 
sneakers. Luckily, I had brought two pairs. My shoes from yesterday sat in the 
corner, still soaked through and mud-covered. 



Theyll turn up, Larry replied finally. But he didnt sound as if he meant it. 

I finished getting dressed, then ran up the hill to get breakfast. It was a 
warm, gray morning. It must have rained during the night. The tall grass 
glistened wetly. 

Yawning and blinking against the harsh gray light, campers headed quietly 
up the hill. I saw that most of them had the same confused expression I had. 

Why were we going on this unscheduled hike so early in the morning? How 
long was it going to be? Where were we going? 

I hoped that Uncle A1 or one of the counselors would explain everything to 
us at breakfast, but none of them appeared in the mess hall. 

We ate quietly, without the usual joking around. 

I found myself thinking about the terrifying canoe trip yesterday. I could 
almost taste the brackish water again. I saw Larry coming toward me, facedown, 
floating on the churning water like a clump of seaweed. 

I pictured myself trying to get to him, struggling to swim, struggling to go 
against the current, to keep afloat in the swirls of white water. 

And I saw a blur of the canoe as the strong river current carried it out of 
sight. 

Suddenly, Dawn and Dori burst into my thoughts. I wondered if they were 
okay. I wondered if they were going to try to meet me again by the waterfront. 

Breakfast was French toast with syrup. It was usually my favorite. But this 
morning, I just poked at it with my fork. 

Line up outside! a counselor cried from the doorway. 

Chairs scraped loudly. We all obediently climbed to our feet and began 
making our way outside. 

Where are they taking us ? 

Why doesnt anyone tell us what this is about? 

The sky had brightened to pink, but the sun still hadnt risen over the 
horizon. 

We formed a single line along the side wall of the lodge. I was near the end 
of the line toward the bottom of the hill. 

Some kids were cracking jokes and playfully shoving each other. But most 
were standing quietly or leaning against the wall, waiting to see what was going 
to happen. 

Once the line was formed, one of the counselors walked the length of it, 
pointing his finger and moving his lips in concentration as he counted us. He 



counted us twice to make sure he had the right number. 

Then Uncle A1 appeared at the front of the line. He wore a brown-and-green 
camouflage outfit, the kind soldiers wear. He had on very black sunglasses, even 
though the sun wasnt up yet. 

He didnt say a word. He signaled to Larry and another counselor, who were 
both carrying very large, heavy-looking brown bags over their shoulders. Then 
Uncle A1 strode quickly down the hill, his eyes hidden behind the dark glasses, 
his features set in a tight frown. 

He stopped in front of the last camper. This way! he announced loudly, 
pointing toward the waterfront. 

Those were his only words. This way! 

And we began to follow, walking at a pretty fast clip. Our sneakers slid 
against the wet grass. A few kids were giggling about something behind me. 

To my surprise, I realized I was now nearly at the front of the line. I was 
close enough to call out to Uncle Al. So I did. Where are we going? I shouted. 

He quickened his pace and didnt reply. 

Uncle Alis this a long hike? I called. 

He pretended he hadnt heard. 

I decided to give up. 

He led us toward the waterfront, then turned right. Thick clumps of trees 
stood a short way up ahead where the river narrowed. 

Glancing back to the end of the line, I saw Larry and the other counselor, 
bags on their shoulders, hurrying to catch up to Uncle Al. 

What is this about? I wondered. 

And as I stared at the clumps of low, tangled trees up ahead, a thought 
pushed its way into my head. 

I can escape. 

The thought was so frighteningbut suddenly so realit took a long time to 
form. 

I can escape into these trees. 

I can run away from Uncle Al and this frightening camp. 

The idea was so exciting, I nearly stumbled over my own feet. I bumped 
into the kid ahead of me, a big bruiser of a guy named Tyler, and he turned and 
glared at me. 

Whoa, I told myself, feeling my heart start to pound in my chest. Think 
about this. Think carefully. 



I kept my eyes locked on the woods. As we drew closer, I could see that the 
thick trees, so close together that their branches were all intertwined, seemed to 
stretch on forever. 

Theyd never find me in there, I told myself. It would be really easy to hide 
in those woods. 

But then what? 

I couldnt stay in the woods forever. 

Then what? 

Staring at the trees, I forced myself to concentrate, forced myself to think 
clearly. 

I could follow the river. Yes. Stay on the shore. 

Follow the river. It was bound to come to a town eventually. It had to come 
to a town. 

Id walk to the first town. Then Id call my parents. 

I can do it, I thought, so excited I could barely stay in line. 

I just have to run. Make a dash for it. When no one is looking. Into the 
woods. Deep into the woods. 

We were at the edge of the trees now. The sun had pulled itself up, 
brightening the rose-colored morning sky. We stood in the shadows of the trees. 

I can do it, I told myself. 

Soon. 

My heart thudded loudly. I was sweating even though the air was still cool. 

Calm down, Billy, I warned myself. Just calm down. 

Wait for your chance. 

Wait till the time is right. 

Then leave Camp Nightmare behind. Forever. 

Standing in the shade, I studied the trees. I spotted a narrow path into the 
woods a few yards up head. 

I tried to calculate how long it would take me to reach the path. Probably 
ten seconds at most. And then in another five seconds, I could be into the 
protection of the trees. 

I can do it, I thought. 

I can be gone in less than ten seconds. 

I took a deep breath. I braced myself. I tensed my leg muscles, preparing to 

mn. 

Then I glanced to the front of the line. 



To my horror, Unde A1 was staring directly at me. And he held a rifle in his 
hands.

I cried out when I saw the rifle in his hands. 

Had he read my thoughts? Did he know I was about to make a run for it? 

A cold chill slid down my back as I gaped at the rifle. As I raised my eyes 
to Uncle Als face, I realized he wasnt looking at me. 

He had turned his attention to the two counselors. They had lowered the 
bags to the ground and were bending over them, trying to get them open. 

Why did we stop? Tyler, the kid ahead of me, asked. 

Is the hike over? another kid joked. A few kids laughed. 

Guess we can go back now, another kid said. 

I stood watching in disbelief as Larry and the other counselor began 
unloading rifles from the two bags. 

Line up and get one, Uncle A1 instructed us, tapping the handle of his own 
rifle against the ground. One rifle per boy. Come onhurry! 

No one moved. I think everyone thought Uncle A1 was kidding or 
something. 

Whats wrong with you boys? I said hurry! he snapped angrily. He grabbed 
up an armload of rifles and began moving down the line, pushing one into each 
boys hands. 

He pushed a rifle against my chest so hard, I staggered back a few steps. I 
grabbed it by the barrel before it fell to the ground. 

Whats going on? Tyler asked me. 

I shrugged, studying the rifle with horror. Id never held any kind of real gun 
before. My parents were both opposed to firearms of all kinds. 

A few minutes later, we were all lined up in the shadow of the trees, each 
holding a rifle. Uncle A1 stood near the middle of the line and motioned us into a 
tight circle so we could hear him. 

Whats going on? Is this target practice? one boy asked. 

Larry and the other counselor snickered at that. Uncle Als features 
remained hard and serious. 

Listen up, he barked. No more jokes. This is serious business. 

The circle of campers tightened around him. We grew silent. A bird 
squawked noisily in a nearby tree. Somehow it reminded me of my plan to 



escape. 

Was I about to be really sorry that I hadnt made a run for it? 

Two girls escaped from the girls camp last night, Uncle A1 announced in a 
flat, businesslike tone. A blonde and a redhead. 

Dawn and Dori! I exclaimed to myself. Ill bet it was them! 

I believe, Uncle A1 continued, that these are the same two girls who 
sneaked over to the boys camp and hid near the waterfront a few days ago. 

Yes! I thought happily. It is Dawn and Dori! They escaped! 

I suddenly realized a broad smile had broken out on my face. I quickly 
forced it away before Uncle A1 could see my happy reaction to the news. 

The two girls are in these woods, boys. Theyre nearby, Uncle A1 continued. 
He raised his rifle. Your guns are loaded. Aim carefully when you see them. 
They wont get away from us!

Huh? I gasped in disbelief. You mean were supposed to shoot them? 

I glanced around the circle of campers. They all looked as dazed and 
confused as I did. 

Yeah. Youre supposed to shoot them, Uncle A1 replied coldly. I told 
youtheyre trying to escape. 

But we cant! I cried. 

Its easy, Uncle A1 said. He raised his rifle to his shoulder and pretended to 
fire it. See? Nothing to it. 

But we cant kill people! I insisted. 

Kill? His expression changed behind the dark glasses. I didnt say anything 
about killing, did I? These guns are loaded with tranquilizer darts. We just want 
to stop these girlsnot hurt them. 

Uncle A1 took two steps toward me, the rifle still in his hands. He stood 
over me menacingly, lowering his face close to mine. 

You got a problem with that, Billy? he demanded. 

He was challenging me. 

I saw the other boys back away. 

The woods grew silent. Even the bird stopped squawking. 

You got a problem with that? Uncle A1 repeated, his face so close to mine, I 
could smell his sour breath. 

Terrified, I took a step back, then another. 

Why was he doing this to me? Why was he challenging me like this? 

I took a deep breath and held it. Then I screamed as loudly as I could: II 
wont do it! 

Without completely realizing what I was doing, I raised the rifle to my 
shoulder and aimed the barrel at Uncle Als chest. 

Youre gonna be sorry, Uncle A1 growled in a low voice. He tore off the 
sunglasses and heaved them into the woods. Then he narrowed his eyes furiously 
at me. Drop the rifle, Billy. Im gonna make you sorry. 

No, I told him, standing my ground. Youre not. Camp is over. Youre not 
going to do anything. 

My legs were trembling so hard, I could barely stand. 



But I wasnt going to go hunting Dawn and Dori. I wasnt going to do 
anything else Uncle A1 said. Ever. 

Give me the rifle, Billy, he said in his low, menacing voice. He reached out 
a hand toward my gun. Hand it over, boy. 

No! I cried. 

Hand it over now, he ordered, his eyes narrowed, burning into mine. Now! 
No! I cried. 

He blinked once. Twice. 

Then he leaped at me. 

I took a step back with the rifle aimed at Uncle Aland pulled the trigger.

The rifle emitted a soft pop. 

Uncle A1 tossed his head back and laughed. He let his rifle drop to the 
ground at his feet. 

Hey! I cried out, confused. I kept the rifle aimed at his chest. 

Congratulations, Billy, Uncle A1 said, grinning warmly at me. You passed. 
He stepped forward and reached out his hand to shake mine. 

The other campers dropped their rifles. Glancing at them, I saw that they 
were all grinning, too. Larry, also grinning, flashed me a thumbs-up sign. 

Whats going on? I demanded suspiciously. I slowly lowered the rifle. 

Uncle A1 grabbed my hand and squeezed it hard. Congratulations, Billy. I 
knew youd pass. 

Huh? I dont understand! I screamed, totally frustrated. 

But instead of explaining anything to me, Uncle A1 turned to the trees and 
shouted, Okay, everyone! Its over! He passed! Come out and congratulate him! 

And as I stared in disbelief, my wide-open mouth hanging down around my 
knees, people began stepping out from behind the trees. 

First came Dawn and Dori. 

You were hiding in the woods! I cried. 

They laughed in response. Congratulations! Dawn cried. 

And then others came out, grinning and congratulating me. I screamed 
when I recognized Mike. He was okay! 

Beside him were Jay and Roger! 

Colin stepped out of the woods, followed by Tommy and Chris. All smiling 
and happy and okay. 

Whatwhats going on here? I stammered. I was totally stunned. I felt dizzy. 

I didnt get it. I really didnt get it. 

And then my mom and dad stepped out from the trees. Mom rushed up and 
gave me a hug. Dad patted the top of my head. I knew youd pass, Billy, he said. I 
could see happy tears in his eyes. 

Finally, I couldnt take it anymore. I pushed Mom gently away. Passed 
what! ? I demanded. What is this? Whats going on? 



Uncle A1 put his arm around my shoulders and guided me away from the 
group of campers. Mom and Dad followed close behind. 

This isnt really a summer camp, Uncle A1 explained, still grinning at me, 
his face bright pink. Its a government testing lab. 

Huh? I swallowed hard. 

You know your parents are scientists, Billy, Uncle A1 continued. Well, 
theyre about to leave on a very important expedition. And this time they wanted 
to take you along with them. 

How come you didnt tell me? I asked my parents. 

We couldnt! Mom exclaimed. 

According to government rules, Billy, Uncle A1 continued, children arent 
allowed to go on official expeditions unless they pass certain tests. Thats what 
youve been doing here. Youve been taking tests. 

Tests to see what? I demanded, still dazed. 

Well, we wanted to see if you could obey orders, Uncle A1 explained. You 
passed when you refused to go to the Forbidden Bunk. He held up two fingers. 
Second, we had to test your bravery. You demonstrated that by rescuing Larry. 
He held up a third finger. Third, we had to see if you knew when not to follow 
orders. You passed that test by refusing to hunt for Dawn and Dori. 

And everyone was in on it? I asked. All the campers? The counselors? 
Everyone? They were all actors? 

Uncle A1 nodded. They all work here at the testing lab. His expression 
turned serious. You see, Billy, your parents want to take you to a very dangerous 
place, perhaps the most dangerous place in the known universe. So we had to 
make sure you can handle it. 

The most dangerous place in the universe? 

Where? I asked my parents. Where are you taking me? 

Its a very strange planet called Earth, Dad replied, glancing at Mom. Its 
very far from here. But it could be exciting. The inhabitants there are weird and 
unpredictable, and no one has ever studied them. 

Laughing, I stepped between my mom and dad and put my arms around 
them. Earth?! It sounds pretty weird. But it could never be as dangerous or 
exciting as Camp Nightmoon! I exclaimed. 

Well see, Mom replied quietly. Well see.
